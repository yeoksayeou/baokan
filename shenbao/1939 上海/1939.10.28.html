<p>社評</p>
<h3>卹貧問題</h3>
<p>居今而言一般之生活，誠可謂非常時期之非常生活，蓋自「統制」操其柄，投機揚其波，商販助其瀾，歐戰長其流，而物價乃如野燒之燎原，自有不可遏制之勢矣。日新月異，高價層出，歷時愈久而一般之生活愈窘，遑論貧寒之家，莫不仰屋興嗟，即平時仰事俯畜差堪支持之戶，亦爲咄咄書空，而嘆長安之居大不易矣。何况凝霜將降，木葉疏落，朔風既起，嚴冬伊邇，彼食力以爲生者家無擔石寸縷之儲，室有號寒啼飢之聲，甯無作牛衣之對泣。至於因兵燹而失業或流離失所者，躑躅街頭，棲蔽簷下，忍飢耐寒，任令大自然支配其生存之命運，觳觫有如堂下之牛羊。而環顧四周，霓虹之光眩目，淫靡之音亂耳，重裘不溫，紅爐猶寒，飫珍饜羞，剔精選肥，相形之下，苦樂懸殊，若是之環境，是吾造化小兒，故弄狡獪，而使人類享受顯分厚薄，皆非也。殆卹貧政策不遑早舉，不忍之心蘊而未發耳。</p>
<p>世固不乏已飢已溺爲懷者，然拯之於既飢既溺之後，何如謀之於未飢未溺之初。滬上士女，見義勇爲，樂善好施者，實繁有徒，前年之徵募寒衣，不崇朝而數萬件立集，其行抑何仁且勇耶！若必待遊藝而後輸將，跳舞而始解囊，則較之一毛不拔，强而猶有難色者固聊勝一籌也。以言救濟，必需巨款，款將安出，仍賴衆擎，若能節省無謂之消耗，烟酒果餌之浪費，移用於卹貧濟衆，則其所獲或亦匪尠。不觀乎本年一二三季如蜜橘蘋果等果品曁烟酒香水香粉雪花膏等之進口價値，竟有四千二百八十四萬元之巨額乎？然此猶照中央掛牌之法幣兌換關金平計算也。若照黑市折換，又當二三倍其値，其他進口消耗品物類此者尚不勝枚舉。夫中國抗戰二年餘，瘡痍滿目，城邑爲墟，而人民猶以口腹之欲，聲色之娛是騖，醉生夢死，不思警惕，甯非哀莫大於心死，不可救藥者歟！所幸此不過少數席豐履厚之輩，漠視國難之嚴重，而仍度其窮奢極侈之生活；亦有囤積致富，投機起家，儻來之物，不稍吝惜，得意忘形，惟以口腹是快者。此輩處於社會，無異寄生之蟲，任意揮霍，甯何足惜，特其個人之損失尚小，而造成社會奢侈之風，增重國家漏巵之鉅，其害實大。果能稍制其嗜欲，稍節其靡費，少此數千百萬元水果烟酒各項之消費，固無礙於其必需之生活。再能出其所省。集而用之於社會事業則社會安，用之於工商實業則百業興，使人人能樂其業，安其居，養生送死無憾，卹貧尚復成何問題哉！</p>
<p>惟其不能，且卹貧必又待勸而舉，募而集，勉而成，哀而興，且尚有充耳不聞，熟視無覩者矣。夫仁心爲人人所同具，即惻隱之心，亦人皆有之。惻隱之心者，人類廣大之同情心也。耶主博愛，回重施舍，佛則慈悲救濟，儒則汎愛親仁，時代有先後，地域有遠近，其揆一也。其宅心救人亦一也，人人以耶回佛儒之心爲心，卹貧亦不復成爲問題。然世固有自以爲無待於人救，而亦不寄貧困以同情；亦有浮沉於慾海，陷溺而不知自拔，以爲貧困固與我無關也，及其蘧然覺悟，方知救人救已，初無二致，而已晚矣。故惟有自己感覺凍餒之苦痛，而後對於卹貧之同情心乃能油然而生，但往往爲處境所限，心有餘，力不足，遂將熱情消磨於無形，忍見同胞輾轉於水火，至於赤貧之輩，自顧不遑，更覺愛莫能助矣。由是而言，卹貧在事實上之進行，固猶是問題也。</p>
<p>雖然，卹貧問題，社會問題中之一大問題也，消極的救卹，而使暫安一時猶爲枝葉，積極的救卹，而使民不患貧，實爲根本。但處目前危殆之環境，嚴重之生活，能事消極的救卹，亦云幸已。海上一隅，今日衣食不給，度日如年者，不知有若干萬人，衣不蔽體，食不果腹，庇寒無所，乞食無門者，又不知若干萬人，一至朔風凛冽，泳雪交加，忍視其露宿道側，而成餓莩，抑爲之稍加援手，俾得苟延殘喘，而於戰事平息物價下趨之日，有復其尋常生活，或返其故里以安居之可能，此則公衆之責而義不容却者也。易不云乎，積善之家，必有餘慶，積不善之家，必有餘殃，滬上居民，貧困者固多，富有者亦衆，苟抱爲善豈肯後人之決心，以有餘補不足，則卹貧又豈難事。至於一般生活問題之商榷，是當容諸別論也。</p>

<h3>廣州之紊亂情形　日軍容收盜匪刧風益盛　奸商操縱金融紙幣低折</h3>
<p>香港通信、廣州淪陷、迄今已一整年、人口雖比較淪陷之初略有增加、然並不因是而增加廣州之繁榮、反增加治安之紊亂、蓋返市住居人民、一半爲窮無所歸之難民、一半爲挺而走險之就撫綠林、難民即從港澳及各鄕遄返、床頭金盡、回市亦無正當之職業、應召之綠林、則狐假虎威、橫行市內、在日軍以爲利用彼輩爲爪牙、一可使充偵探、以盜治盜、一可暫爲籠絡、以减少被游擊之苦、詛知虎狼入市、暗殺械刦之案、比諸冷落時期允多、從前日軍所防者爲小竊、今則所患者爲明目張膽之當途截殺、及機關集會時之炸彈、從前郊外日軍步哨、尚能放出里許、今則不但近郊需駐重兵、即市區已撤之檢查崗位、亦已規復、且崗位附近、更掘短兵溝、日軍初以爲「以華制華」之策可行、今則已覺能發不能收、故目下廣州秩序、十分紊亂、市民返市者、多數稍住旬日、即又間道逃出、</p>
<p>廣州市塲、迄今仍無正當大商業、除日本商行外、皆屬日常食物店此項糧食店、多爲店伴凑小資本經營、或縮小範圍、由店鋪形式變爲攤位形式、物價無正確標準、隨治安情形而定、苟市內突然無故戒嚴、小販無從出入市區、則食料馬上漲價、最近市內　融紛亂、允爲市塲上及人民生活上之致命傷、查金融紛亂主因在低折紙幣、而紙幣之低折起因、允爲無意識、查廣州所通用者、爲省銀行之毫券、而毫券之發行、距今已有多年、其間輾轉流通、自難保存紙色或紙質之不略變、詎市而對紙幣低折、即以紙幣殘舊爲藉口、苟屬殘舊者、即不予十足收用、或以六成行使、或以五成行使、一般持有舊紙幣者、莫不無形損失、聞岐視舊幣、爲一般銀號奸商、彼輩預先收蓄新幣、迨市面低折舊幣之風一行、便可將新券換出、一操一縱、獲利無算、</p>
<p>自低折紙幣風潮發生後、首受其害者爲小食店、因收入舊幣、旣不能低折、而結賬則受損失、因此而閉業者、爲數不少、僞組織對此、一籌莫展、而留市居民、愈覺水深火熱矣、</p>
<p>廣州與各鄉交通、依然梗塞、日前日軍利用無知航商、許以暫時小利、使號召船隻、恢復各江航行、江門一部份小輪、曾　回廣州、恢復廣州順德及廣州江鬥各航綫、詛行駛未幾、各輪渡迭遭游擊隊截擊、未匝月、又復相繼停航、現在除廣州佛山。廣州番禺。間有渡船一二艘行駛外、其餘航綫、中斷如故、至鐵路方面、當廣州失陷時、各路機車多被炸燬、自日軍入廣州、爲利便日軍運輸計、會將廣三路（由廣州至佛山段）先行通車、以爲軍用、後又修理廣九路、行駛廣州至石灘之軍車、，最近石灘車站迭被華軍襲擊、聞己停車、總之、目下廣州水陸交通、僅能達到日軍所謂之外衛綫、逾此、已被華軍圍得水洩不通矣、</p>
<h3>華軍三度猛衝潮安　日偽軍死傷二三百人</h3>
<p>汕頭通信、潮汕華軍、自與保安隊游擊隊配合後、即重新佈防、每日派少數部隊、輪流向潮城反攻、使日軍無休息調整機會、本月九十兩日、華軍分兩路推進潮城南門外沙洲一帶、十日晚、向南面突襲雲步市、衡入日軍陣營、擊斃日軍百餘、十二日、汕頭日軍、趕往潮安應援、此時浮洋各處日軍據點、已被華軍圍困、不能兼顧潮城、十三日、華軍北向、分三路襲擊筆架山、下午三時、首先將山下。土塘日哨兵站一隊擊漬、乘勢撲攻山腰、相持至晚上十時、華方援軍趕到、大舉向山上撲攻、日軍匿土窟中、堅拒不出、華軍當用乾草醮煤油、繫於石塊上投入土壕中、一時滿山火光熊熊、日軍見勢不佳、急將山半工事摧毀、退返潮安城、是晚、華軍斬殺日軍五六十名、是役華軍曾衝入城中三决、第一次爲保安團楊營、由南門衡人、在觀音堂街口發生巷戰、相持四十五分鐘、南門一帶、掛有鐵絲網及生電、楊營因損失過重、自動退却、十三晚深夜十二時、華方敢死隊撲攻西門、縱火焚燒叢林巷日兵營、幷用手溜彈衝殺一小時始退、十四日上午五時、華軍攻入東門外東津村、韓山師範學校日軍司令部、即開鋼砲亂轟、計衡殺三决、日僞軍死傷二三百人、</p>
<h3>鎭江物價飛漲　可見民生困苦</h3>
<p>鎭江通訊、鎭江自遭日軍盤踞後、民生一切、均極蕭條、日用百貨物價、因來源短少、均飛漲不已、如米麵油鹽等、咸供不應求、因鎭地米糧、向仰給江北及蕪湖等處、九月末至十月初米價、曾至每石十八允以上、本月十日以後、新米上市、來源頻仍、始跌至每石十五六元、近日來源更湧、但因交通關係、上等秈米、仍每担售價十四元二角、中等十三元三角、下等十三元、洋秈米上等十四元、秈稻每祖在六元二三角之間、此等價格雖云减低、惟與去年十月之九元五角相比、則遠多矣、麵粉有日方卵翼下之綠金山牌、每袋六元九角、紅金山六元六角、藍金山五元七角、其價與南京相彷、油類中除醬油有多數醬園自造外、豆蔴兩油、則仰給外來、計凈豆油每担四十五元、每元二斤二兩、蔴油每担五十元、每兀一斤十二兩、醬油則自二十元至二十四元不等、鹽被日方「通源公司」把持、售鹽以華興僞券爲標準、致無形中、每担增加三元餘、現在每担合法幣十五元七角五分、零售每斤一角六分、燃料亦因物價昂貴、以致柴價隨而高漲、茅草每担七角零、松枝木柴每担在一元至一元二角、煤炭隨時缺貨、開平屑煤每噸五十六元五角、安南塊煤每元十六斤、安南煤屑每元三十五斤、</p>
<h3>華軍逼近吳江　日軍放棄蘇郊據點　交由偽軍部塡防</h3>
<p>蘇州通訊、盤踞本邑之日軍、因實力薄弱、故於月前將四郊據點放棄、雖至今猶有一二處未行撤退、但多數兵士、改由僞綏靖司令壟國標部瓜代、該部僞軍、爲昔日太湖中之土匪、份子極形複雜、平日專事在駐留地帶行刦人民財物、但偶聞華軍活動、即現慌惶狀態、故分伏四郊華軍、利用機會、向日僞軍襲擊、刻正向吳江嚴墓方面推進、大有沿蘇嘉鐵路直趨本邑之勢、因此本邑日軍、近日强微蘇鄉農民、在吳江·三里橋·尹山一帶、趕築防禦工程、以資困守　　教育消息　黔教廳　　令省縣各學校遷鄉　並實施義務教育　　（貴陽航訊）本省數月前屢遭空襲凡人口稠密各縣、省府嚴令疏散、敎廳爲謀全省師生安全計、分令省縣各公私立學校、遷移較爲偏僻之鄕鎭、如靑崖·花溪·龍里·畢節等地、絃歌之聲、得以不輟、同時張廳長復念及敎育落後、全省文盲的佔百分九十、欲求迅速普及義務敎育起見、特令各校師生於各所在地、實行小先生制、切實施行義務敎育、茲悉全省各級學校、刻巳遵令辦理不論漢民苗民、實行强迫受敎、內分兒童班·成人班·婦女等班、各校師生、均願努力從事此項工作、課餘之暇、並爲出征人家屢代寫書信、至課程方面、除敎授普通知識、以及防空常識等敎材、自實以來、時僅一月、而收效頗宏云、　　難童救濟教養胡癥結和改進辦法（六）　錢用和</p>
<p>（二）認淸敎養目標　難童敎濟敎養、原是爲减少民族的犧牲、和敵人奴化的對象、並培植民族幼苗、養成建國勁旅爲目的、所以敎養難童、至高無上的目標、是爲民族的解放、國家的改造、最近切實的目標、是爲兒童前途的幸福、可是現在辦理難童敎養事業的人、却有三種事實的表現、一種抱有爲民族國家培育人才的觀念、但缺乏富於敎育經騐的才力、設施敎養、祇得偏重於救濟慈善的工作、以收容兒童的數量、來表現成績、對於質量的改進、尚不易顧及、一種視救濟難童爲抗戰間光榮的工作、爲增加自身的榮譽起見、也來辦理難童敎養事業、同時救濟了一般失業敎師、第三種假借難童敎養的名義、以業童爲募款的工具、並位置私人、拓植勢力、所以難童敎養事業、儘管各方努力推進、能上敎養正軌的、還是少數、我們希望辦理敎養工作的同志、大家認識敎養難童的正確目標、應以兒童幸福爲本位、國家改造、民族解放、爲最終目的、</p>
<p>（三）增加敎養經費　各難童救濟團體開始收容難童的時候、究竟應該每個兒童需要有多少的敎養費才算適當、大家都沒有經騐、本着刻苦耐勞、質樸節儉的宗旨、保育會首先定出每個兒童每月三元一月的伙食、其他一切都是從捐募中來、敎職員每人每月發給十元的生活費、不論工作繁簡、資歷高低、這種辦法、原是義務多權利少的精神表現、但結果兒童方面、在鄕村的只有吃三月一日的伙食、在城市的各方捐助有牛奶、餅乾糖果衣被鐵床等、同是兒童、物質的享受、就大相逕庭、敎職員方面因爲是義務的、熱心人士、大家來表示盡義務致工作人多、負責人少、敎養難童、幾成爲拔苗助長的局面、再加生活稈度提高、所以重訂兒童生活費標準爲每月每人五元、敎職員薪金也依據工作責任資歷爲標準、最近兒童生活費、及敎職員薪金、又規定爲以每童每月十元計、其他團體難童敎養經費、大都參考保育會標準、現在也已提高、但是物價騰貴的迅速、超過於行政的改進、振濟委員會在去年九月、擬定敎養院兒童每月每人十元的經常費、原是改進的標準、就事實論、現在又感不敷分配、兒童人數多、尚可調節、人數少、就無法挹注、開辦費及其他特別設備、都不在內、所以各院除兒童衣食勉可維持外、如無捐助、敎的成績、實無法表現、生產敎育更談不到、所以增加敎養經費、也是目前迫切的問題、</p>
<p>（四）調整敎養機構　難童敎養、爲國家抗戰期間事業的一部分、辦理人員、應明瞭這一點分工合作地去完成這個偉大的使命、振濟委員會在漢口的時候、就的保育會救濟會慈幼會及漢口市難民兒童敎育委員會商討分工敎養的原則、保育會注重嬰兒幼兒的保育、救濟會注重生產敎育的實騐、慈幼會注重淪陷區難童的敎養、漢口市難民兒童敎育委員會注重難民收容所附近短期小學的推行、使各有一中心敎育的工作、成績的表現、也易顯著、但事實上前方兒童搶救來的時候、大家都視爲親生骨肉、非不得已、誰願把自己從辛苦中搶來的兒童送出去呢結果大範圍的敎養政策、是不易現實、求其决、希望各團體就自己所設的保育院、敎養院、慈幼院中擬一通盤敎養的計劃、指定甲院注重嬰兒保育、乙院注重普通敎育、丙院注重家事敎育、丁院注重農事或工藝敎育、戊院注重特殊敎育、互相調整、交換兒童、使敎養工作、迅巡發展、但是各院與各院的心理、正如各團體與各團禮的心理、愛兒如已出、一時尚難切實調整、所以一院中有年齡自三歲至十四歲——實際或已十七八歲　的兒童、有不識字至初中程度的兒童、有優良家庭的兒童、有流浪街頭的兒童、有年長的男女兒童、應有盡有、敎養上的困難問題、複雜萬狀、所以希望難童教育有長足的進步、調整教養機構、是治本的急務、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙供求衆寡不敵　滙價遂見繼續鬆動</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市況、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市情況、先軟後硬、雖滙豐吃胃頗宏、終因塞者居多、頭寸上依然　寡懸殊、故趨勢仍鬆、初開以美英滙兌續縮八七五、致遠又呈英平美緊狀態、　　沙　　扒、市面再軟、英金曾爲四辨士九〇六二五、美滙爲八元一五六二五、入後日行美行一直賣出、且港電頻吐、緩緩上升、直達先令五辨士、美滙八元三一二五、但以滙豐扒進殊力、雖日行港電復出、亦不脫盤旋局勢、延至午收、英金爲四辨士九八四三七五、美滙則爲八元三一二五、午後情形稍異、港幫供給殊殷、某外行亦　意未消、但滙豐進胃已不若上午之健、故而英金重出五辨士關口、爲五辨士〇三一二五鬆價、美滙亦已硬達八元三七五、　至收市、則英金尚爲五辨士、美滙爲八元三四三七五、結果較隔昨各鬆〇三一二五、至期貨交易仍多做開、潛勢與現貨相似、全天交易暢旺、</p>
<p>日美商一致賣出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期漲五六二五、遠期長八七五、紐約銀價縮一分二五、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對外各滙俱平、美對英降八七五、對滬大二角、對法小二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行長開現貨實價、英金四辨士九六八七五、美滙八元三八一二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃滙兌降落之故、開后因沙遜前來扒結、且外行供意不濃、致狀況緊軟、計結進大通等外行現貨英金四辨士九三七五、及現貨美滙八元二一八七五至一五六二五、後英金最軟、銀行曾　過四辨士九〇六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大三分七五、此後同行突乘機塞出、且香港來電吐售、市勢頓轉鬆硬、計同行售予外行現貨英金四辨士九六八七五、及現貨美滙八元二五與三一二五、時港電與某行塞予滙豐現貨英金五辨士、並　比吐予同行十一月份美滙八元一八七五、嗣因滙豐吃胃殷健、投機家遂稍起扒風、加之華行收買本月期美滙、是以情況復趨軟化、計金城扒進大通某行本月期美滙八元二八一二五及二五、後現貨竟又步軟至四辨士九三七五及八元一八七五、午刻港電與同行復與賣風、故過程重見回硬、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金已硬至四辨士九八四三七五、美滙亦鬆達八元三一二五、比晨開英鬆〇一五六二五、美回硬〇三一二五、聞收後因滙豐納胃呆滯、英金又長至五辨士、美滙再鬆達八元三四三七五、</p>
<p>英金收盤五辨士</p>
<p>後市因港幫續來吐塞、且某行亦供意濃厚、致狀態靜中又略帶硬化、英金一度出五辨士關、計港電吐予滙豐現貨英金五辨士〇一五六二五、時某行亦售予華商　現貨美滙八元三七五、後英金最硬喊過五辨士〇三一二五、入後賣風　　、爲狀稍平、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價英金五辨士、美滙八元三四三七五、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金四辨士九五三一二五、美滙八元二五、結果比隔昨現期英美滙均鬆〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港美匯廿五元</p>
<p>香港二十七日電、今晨滙市開盤平平、英滙日滙不動、美滙現貨續緊〇六二五、爲二十五元、申滙現貨升二元、爲二百九十八元、遠期均未開出、十一時正平穩、申滙現貨回降四元、爲二百九十四元、十一時三十分申滙現貨重升四元、爲二百九十八元、午收重降一元、爲二百九十七元、二時三十分開盤平平、申滙現貨續降三元、爲二百九十四元、</p>

<h3>現金欲漲反跌　港幫雖扒難敵賣氣</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、頹風難振、且外滙轉鬆、買進不如賣氣之盛、市面雖全日上落倐忽、亦不過緊隨匯市鬆緊爲變化而已、初開狀態堅挺、蓋以外匯緊軟、而港幫亦來喊買、　　跳三十元爲三千八百十元、開盤後以外匯轉硬、引起天津幫銀樓幫及某金號拋出、即達三千七百三十五元低盤、嗣因外匯告穩、散戶亦趁低撈進、港幫則復起買風、致一度曾拉至三千七百八十元、造至午收因外滙重硬、金號等又出以三千七百六十元收盤、午後外匯續硬、錢兌業等吐出、繼因港幫等吸收曾由三千七百四十七元升至三千七百七十五元、延至收盤則爲三千七百七十元、較上日軋跌十元、交易仍暢、約二千數百兩、銀樓飾金先漲后跌、終則無軒輊、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋小十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外匯步軟、人氣頗烈、且其時客幫吃胃仍強、開市竟　跳三十元、錢兌業進金號　十兩、爲三千八百十元、旋聞外匯突轉鬆勢、人氣　形虛弱、證券幫與銀樓幫及某金號等紛來猛塞、雖某金號暨某銀樓代港幫收買二百餘兩、無如頭寸仍難相敵、竟盤落七十五元、銀樓幫吐予錢兌業五十兩、價爲三千七百三十五元、此後外匯倐又轉軟、引起搶　子者趁低撈進、加之香港幫又委某金號收買、遂立抬高四十五元、某金號進某銀號三十兩價爲三千七百八十元、午刻外匯忽又回硬、錢兌業與金號競相塞出、同時港幫吃胃轉淡、不久復小二十五元、金號與錢兌業吐予某金號（代港幫）共五十兩、價爲三千七百五十五元、後錢兌業進證券幫二十兩爲三千七百六十元作午收價、午後初開因外匯續硬、　小十元、證券幫賣予金號三十兩、價爲三千七百五十元、繼回起五元、另一證券幫進銀樓幫二十兩價爲三千七百五十五元、後錢兌業吐售、重　小八元、錢兌業售予證券幫十兩、價爲三千七百四十七元、入後某銀樓突又代客幫搜　、遂拉高二十八元、某銀樓進金號三十兩、爲三千七百七十五元、後港幫中　扒吸而懷觀望、頓見回落十五元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價爲三千七百六十元、此後某證券幫代本地幫吸納數十兩、遂又拉起十元、證券幫進錢兌業二七兩、爲三千七百七十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小十元、現金號之本　金售出價、　　赤較高十元、收進須減小二十餘元、現　金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均　成交、</p>
<p>飾金先大後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍　三百八十元、追至九時半掛高五元、十時一刻突回落五元、此後無變化、結果未分軒輊、大同行仍懸三百八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須減小十五元至二十元不等、</p>
<p>拆息回小</p>
<p>貼現不動</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、缺少變化、每千元終日起伏於五十元左右、與前日最後價無異、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均開一角八分、比上日回小一分云、</p>
<p>美銀暴落</p>
<p>英印轉漲</p>
<p>二十六日倫敦電、銀市投機家買進、少供給、市面平、收盤後極平、照掛牌價五金市　稍有吐出、進戶知足、大條銀近期回長五六二五、遠期升八七五、紐約銀電、美現貨猛小一分二五、又孟買銀電、印銀市況平靜、現貨漲十安那、期貨昂九安那、成交單祗二十五張、</p>
<p>金鎊堅挺</p>
<p>金票續疲</p>
<p>昨日外幣市況、英美金鎊、需要趨殷、市況堅秀、英美金票、則因外滙鬆動、需要呆滯、市況續趨疲勢、香港票需要已稀、市況下遊、法郎票搜求仍殷、市價鑒定微升、新加坡票荷蘭票、供給較增、市況軟弱、安南票因旅行需要、市況頗俏、坎拿大票、因美金票鬆動、自趨疲弱、日金票供求呆滯、晚市爲一元三角一分四厘、朝鮮票需要漸稀、市況回疲、晚市爲一元零九分五厘、昨日市價、美英金鎊俱升一元、英金票降三角、美金票降一角四分、香港票降二分、法郎票升一厘、新加坡票荷蘭票、俱降一角、安南票升三分、義大利票降二分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>銀行準備會　續減滙劃利率</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、自本月九日　減低滙劃利率二分後、昨日又通函各行、續減一分、公單拆款息滙劃改爲二角二分、承兌滙票九十日期貼現率匯劃改爲二角二分、領用同業匯劃息改爲二角二分、至於同業拆放欠息及國幣利率、未有更動、</p>
<h3>證券　外股買進復盛　－內價稍形下落－</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況竟趨於盤旋　疲之勢、交易愈形減退、多數均在觀望、大都　面上一般人略形看小、而多方並無搖動之象、但其加碼勇氣、已見中止、加以日上某方正在開重要會議、雖明知其爲　　道謀、人性不無惴惴、故市價已有抬頭不起之狀、但若回小五七角、必又引起多方之抵抗、以維持於不堅、昨日交易既少、各幫進出數量亦微、並無顯著之買賣、惹人注意、惟大戶多頭未見動手耳、市價結果、除丁　毫無出入外、餘均微低五分一角、九六則小去一角半、成交數祗四十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>股票市況、三友實業社股成交五十股、價十五元、衆業公所昨日股市、開盤平淡無色、價格維持原狀、成交約略較少、迨午後交易開始、大衆興趣突轉濃厚、上海銀公司、中國　　公司　　　橡皮鋼業等股價格　　、甚　注目、</p>
<p>關於生橡皮日下倫敦行市、係每鎊十辨士七五左右、此價　不再漲、似亦能站住勿　、故市場近　對於各種橡皮　不致有拋售傾向、多種著名刊物、對橡皮　　興趣、與日俱增非謂無因、際茲戰爭期間、統計訊報、殊屬有限、但知美國橡皮八月份消費額達五萬零五百噸、較七月份激增六千六百噸、同時八月份存底減少一萬三千噸、惟他處對美橡皮供給之已裝　就道者、爲量略多、至物物交換協定所需之額爲八萬噸故對百分之七十限額、或將保持不變、</p>
<p>倫敦二十六日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、續告上升、麥加利銀行股又升二先令六便士、爲七鎊十二先令六便士、滙豐銀行股各漲一鎊、英倫註冊股爲七十七鎊、香港註冊股爲七十八鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股回升三便士、爲十六先令三便士、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦二十六日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平靜、上下檔各種公債、均無上落、</p>
<h3>紗花　廠家有開出　紗市下挫</h3>
<p>連漲兩日之紗市、昨則受匯票鬆懈影響、又復轉趨下挫、兼之客方無大量發展能力、至於廠方根　鬆動、逢高價時頗有開售之舉、人心又入疲途、但原棉來源雖不斷、然價格尚難大落、故廠方成本提高、前途亦不至於大跌也、根本問題還係實銷太弱、而囤戶手中之貨尚未出籠、暫時納胃不健、就大勢測之、或者不出徘徊之境、須待實需來推動、再現新姿態也、</p>
<p>現紗農開、因客幫仍無大起色、且價目如高、一般搶帽子之流、羣爭賣出、由此一跌十五元、雙馬外棧現貨價爲六百六十二元、棧單簡直乏人問詢、少頃上升七八元、　料外　開出軟後又長、　中賣風忽　、漸漸下降、再達六百六十元、　半日間成交統計一千三百四十包、行情二十支　馬跌十五元半、天女跌十七元、雙地球跌十五元、申新二廠開出二十支天女一千包、價爲六百五十元、新天女二百包、價爲六百六十元、今日出口有一千一百件　海防、又八十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量錄左、</p>

<h3>本棉廠辦轉旺　下月份火機花　拋盤已有做開</h3>
<p>本棉交易　　發展氣象、　　鴻章、申新二廠稍有需要、惟日廠納胃尚閉塞、　業買賣熱　、而有火機花下月份拋盤成交一千包、故紗市雖不離疲憊之境、現棉生意尚堪維持、市價受紗市影響、疲短一二元之　、蘇北來源、到通州花一千四百零三包、北沙來一千四百六十包、茲將現棉售開之行盤錄左、</p>

<p>一二七·〇〇</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、因外匯捉摸不定、棉市交易殊爲呆滯、廠方竟毫無進胃、　業俱抱靜觀態度、日來即日方廠　亦無　包交易、已有多日、大衆意見、謂目前之棉價、殊難有展開之希望也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初因受買戶之壓力、市況殊爲鑒定、各同業俱信中立法能通過無疑、故買戶頗爲踴躍、後因一部份空頭者之拋賣、及多頭獲利了結、棉價因而轉疲、收盤價格與上日相較、計跌落三四磅　不等、印度連同預測漲一羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅　、利物浦漲七便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　日商囤米居奇　－新粳行市見漲</h3>
<p>昨日各幫來源、祗由車輪運到包子二三千包、故人心復堅、各客販大都守　未肯輕脫、本鄉作客際此環境、亦均看好、頗多採辦、故早市市勢頗見　緊、各貨價喊聲遂起、惟後市面一經提升、船客販又復乘高推出、致一時市形又懈、故結果市面呈定升不一之局面、若新粳及客尖見增三·五角外、餘則悉守原盤、計做開常錫特粳卅一元半、次至廿八元、破三十元至二十七八元、蘇同常　特粳三十元、次至二十六七元、　　　種三十元零五角、窰種三十元零二角、野稻三十一元、楓加百哥二十九元　至二十八元四角、松江百哥二十七元半至二十六元半、南港早破二十五元四五角、特羊尖二十三元半、次至二十一元半、特盧尖二十四元次至二十二元半、江北尖二十元零二角、至十九元八角、蕪湖特尖二十元零二角五分、次特尖十八元七角半、陳　三十元至二十八九元、　　二十七五元、全市成交數共約八千餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、客　因客　　食、江北幫以虧本不願　　、江北　存米雖有六七萬包、然成本均須扯二十元以上、故存米　守外、新運亦多停頓、日商方面雖在蕪湖及本市各有　票堆積、但亦不肯隨市大量售出、昨市僅有小數應酬、市面續　二三角、</p>
<h3>客幫整批交易　粉廠限制供給　小麥又漲角許</h3>
<p>現粉交易、續告清淡、南北兩幫客銷、雖有添辦之意、而廠方限制供給、對於大戶交易、竟　持不開、市上浮存棧單流通日漸減少、故市面漸趨沉寂、　市成交除本　日常需用、零星交易外、客銷祗少數點極而已、二號粉廠盤仍爲七元三角、祗供本　零批、　　車及綠兵船客盤七元四角至五角不等、市面尚在醞釀中、今日有粉六千包運香港、</p>
<p>小麥來源、依然不湧、自前日一度猛漲後、售方扳持更烈、廠方進胃、不免退縮、行囤方面、亦以市價太高、觀望不前、結果市面仍高角許、最高價已達十一元一角、今日有豆子七百七十包運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖步軟</h3>
<p>國糖因有增稅之說、趨勢稍定、昨半南　開出五十包、價三十四元半、惠州白續開數十包、五十三元、次白五十八包、四十八元半、刁青乏到、號方觀望未開、餘糖公會　盤、市勢續疲、現貨二四粗白降元半、本棧五十二元半、外棧五十三元半、轉口四十一元七角、降八角、太古車白亦小元半、B嘜五十七元、其餘照退、H嘜車赤四十一元、小去一元、荷赤四十二元半、小五角、本綿白振記一號五十四元、二號五十三元半、三號五十三元、四號五十二元半、本一號冰六十六元、晶明冰六十七元半、均小一元、</p>

<h3>愛情是健康的活力</h3>
<p>虧弱的男子，必然是愛情中的罪人！</p>
<p>與其說“愛情是　　的工作”，母　說“愛情是健康的活力”。因爲有許多男子，雖然終日安坐而食，無所事事，時刻的和妻子廝混在一起，假使在他的身體某部份表現虧弱與無能，在愛的生活中不能和他的妻子相協調而獲得歡暢者，他的愛情就會偷偷地逃去的！夫婦間愛情一失，家庭生活即猶冰炭之不相容，於是勃　、爭吵時起，或竟演出私奔，離婚，自殺等慘劇！反之如男健女美，丈夫雖爲生活的鞭子所驅策，終日忙勞；或遠出征程，與妻離別，但他們的愛情決不因忙勞或別離而減色的。必然情懷兩地，相互珍重，一有機會，他們必謀團圓之道，那時　　甜蜜，簡直快若樂仙，海枯石爛，此情不渝，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，人生是何等的光榮而幸福！</p>
<p>鐵一般的事實的證明，愛情是健康的活力已無疑了。然則男子何以失健，以自陷於人生慘境？據醫學上的論斷，大都因男子於早年犯有自　遺精，或早婚縱欲，生殖腺液消耗枯竭，於是凡神經衰弱，腎萎早洩，發育不全，未老先衰等症即不一而足。此種病夫，不特在夫婦間難諧魚水之歡，做了愛情中的罪人；或竟影響生殖，不育絕嗣，即生子女，亦孱弱多病！此外因爲精力的疲困，在學術上多自曝自棄，在職業上更感難能勝任，或竟一病嗚呼，短命而死，其危險爲何似！</p>
<p>時在今日，上述各症已非爲不治之症。若投以對症特效良藥，必可計日痊愈。特效良藥爲何？即爲生殖腺素製劑“生殖素。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，海狗。熊鹿等體中抽取其生殖腺素，用濃縮複製法，精製成劑，所以品質貴重，性質和平，補力積極而週到，爲任何類似製劑所不及其萬一，所以服後能於一日夜間即生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，常服更能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，必可於短期內根治各症，而使身體益增健康。所以世界名醫均推此劑爲專補虧弱男子之唯一聖劑。惟有遺精者，須兼服“希米脫氏固精片”，以制止遺洩，則治標治本並施，收效必更爲迅速，余憑十餘年來之經驗，採用此劑（永安西藥部及五洲中西大藥房均售）以治愈患者亦不下數萬人云。</p>

<p>藥對如開鎖，這是確實的。所以德國醫聖希米脫博士曾說：“世間無不治之症，惟難得對症良藥”。德國醫藥之所以昌明，博士之力，恐不在少。博士更歷數十年之經驗，秘製一種“希米脫氏固精片”，專治遺精，滑精，漏精等症，功效確實，行銷於全世界，已有口皆碑，爲中外醫師譽爲最對症的治遺聖藥矣！考青年人的所以患遺精症：什九必因自　縱欲，或過勞斷傷，摧殘了性神經，致精關鬆弛之故。　滴不塞，會潰成江海，遺精在初起時，雖甚輕微，但必須速治，以防後患，如因循失治，由輕症的夢遺而變爲無夢的滑精與白日的漏精者甚多。由遺精日久而致精枯血竭，爆發　腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，未老先衰等症象者那更比比皆是。此種青年類多萎靡不振，失學失業失戀是必然的結果；就是已婚者，夫婦生活亦必不能美滿，家庭間　引起種種悲劇，人生至此，痛苦何以！欲謀補救，絕對不可亂投醫亂服藥，以自陷絕境！據世界名醫及余經驗，均以爲仍須服治遺聖藥“希米脫氏固精片”，以鞏固精關，制止遺洩外，並須兼服世界唯一腦腎大補劑生殖腺素製劑“生殖素”，以根本培補腦腎，增益精血，助長發育，調整新陳代謝，繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，益臻健康。</p>
<p>患者李志高君，廣東人，五歲，因遺精失治，復貿然結婚，婚後不能人道，爲妻憎恨，且因腦弱失眠，近更失業，上月來本診所診治，經詳察其病狀後，囑其在華美藥房購“希米脫氏固精片”與“生殖素”使之兼服，並施以電療注射，甫及一月，頃已康復，夫婦愛情美滿，亦已獲得某公司之新職云。</p>

<h3>乳峯的發育多麼重要！  美國醫學博士姚崇培</h3>
<p>無論在甚麼地方，女子總比男子們佔着便宜，俏麗健美的女子，更比平庸醜陋的女子，佔着便宜，這是鐵一般的事實。所以凡是女性，誰不願意自己生得健美多姿，能夠到處香噴噴，甜蜜蜜，爲人歡迎，她好似羣芳中的牡丹，顯得雍容華貴，美妙無倫。</p>
<p>但心與願達，那不是千古以來的一個隱恨嗎！他們有的因爲自幼營養不良，所以雖然經過春情發動期，依然還是弱不禁風，瘦骨嶙峋，一些沒有豐盈的曲綫，根本談不上甚麼健美。有的臉蛋兒倒還長得不錯，無奈她曾因自澶束胸，病後失於調補，白帶淹纏，月經不調，淫欲過度，産後虧損等等，致生殖腺卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影响新陳代謝作用，於是體內即不能產生多量新生細胞。自然肌肉枯瘦，面色萎黃，乳峯更無良好的發育，臀部亦必瘦削而缺乏豐腴，由是女性的特徵美完全喪失，呌她怎能在情場中角勝，獲得如意郎君。不惟此也。且此等女性因乳峯萎癟，生殖腺卵巢分泌缺乏的結果，大都患有性感淡薄，宮冷不娠等症。所以生育艱難，甚且終其生而不獲一孕，縱有百萬家産，亦祗好拱手讓人，與念及此，乳峯對於女性整個的健康與幸福，關係是在大了！但此種缺陷，在科學昌明，醫藥進步的今日，欲謀挽救，並非難事。據中西著名婦科醫師臨床實驗結果。　一推頌服生殖腺卵巢製劑女用“生殖素”，最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑所採之成分，純係健壯動物的卵巢腺素，腦下垂體，肝　，　臟，以及礦植物燐鈣等，在紫光線下精密煉製。故功效準確，藥力偉大，逈非一般普通藥劑所能望其項背，如繼續連服六盒，即可使萎癟的乳峯，隆然高聳，臀部豐腴，經來正常，面色紅潤，增進伉儷間的愛情，獲得無上的健美與幸福。</p>

<p>份子複雜空洞無力</p>
<p>僞「中華工人福益會」，係受日方嗾使、由僞「社會局長」胡壽昌發起、於去年十月問、宜告成立、設會址於外灘日淸公司二樓、胡自任「會長」、日人九保氏昇爲顧問、林資炯爲「秘書長」、以救濟失業、解除工人痛苦相號召、圖拉攏本市各業工會加入合作、但各工會負責人均深明大義、堅拒參加、該會乃吸收若干敗類無賴、虛構工會名義、揑造會員名册、實行自拉自唱、以騙取日方之津貼、究其實際、則因份子複雜、且每多爭權奪利、糾紛迭起、故內部空洞異常、雖經成立年餘、但毫無力量可言、</p>

<p>輪中空無一物「其桅與烟囱均漆黃色、若非卍字旗幟、衆將認其爲瑞典輪、該輪昨由拖輪兩艘、護送徐徐前駛時、駐足而觀者頗衆、該輪駛過美艦奥古斯泰號與美艦伊沙佩爾號時、揚輪尾之旗致敬、但駛過浦江中英法軍艦時、則末致敬、按朗姆賽斯號於八月三十一日離滬赴歐、因當時</p>
<p>大局危急</p>
<p>故駛至吳淞停泊、十月三日宜戰後、該輪遂不能駛出而泊吳淞、上週駛入浦江滿鐵碼頭卸貨、而於昨日復駛浦江上游泊大來碼頭附近、朗姆賽斯號係亨美公司所有、重逾七九八三噸、其在吳淞寄椗費、每日逾三十兩、泊上游浮筒、每日的十五兩、</p>

<h3>慶餘里遷讓案　庭諭試行和解　貧兒院女子銀行訂約展期翻造　房客發現證據昨日再審</h3>
<p>上海貧兒敎養院所有之重慶路慶餘里房屋、經由上海女子銀行包租、訂有契的、租期至民國二十七年十二月三十一日爲止、屆時女子銀行必須將房屋翻造、吾則上海貧兒敎　院將女子銀行所存之證保金四萬九千元、予以沒收、並得請求賠償損失十五萬元、故在去年冬、女子銀行即令全體房客遷讓、以便翻造、而全體房客三千餘人、以時値非常、滬地房屋求過於供、一時焉能覓此多數之房屋、故表示反對、</p>
<p>遂致涉訟</p>
<p>初審女子銀行敗訴、但第二第三審之判决、則遵女子銀行之請求、判令房客遷讓、及屆執行之期、女子銀行在未奉法院强制執行命令之前、即僱工在慶餘里四週圍築竹笆、擬强行拆屋、致又發生房客爲正當防範排除侵害之拆笆糾紛、乃最近房客方面、忽偵悉女子銀行與貧兒敎養院方面、已訂有展期三年翻造之契的、爰即延請袁仰安蘇景麒律師、依法向高二分院民庭提起</p>
<p>再審之訴</p>
<p>請求廢棄原判决、將上海女子銀行聲誚遷讓之訴、予以駁回、及負擔訴訟費用、並以情勢急迫、請求先行裁定、將執行予以停止、復請求迅即飭派警吏前往上海質兒敎養院、及該院法律顧問郭啟明律師處、査吊關於簽訂展期三年翻造之合同、以及有關文件、以保全證據等等、當由高二分院據狀、先行飭警將再審原告所請求查吊之證件、</p>
<p>果予吊獲</p>
<p>後即以裁定命令慶餘里房客、提供一萬五千元保證金後、准予停止執行、一面復准該里房客之聲請、將案再審、昨晨此案由高二分院民庭長韓祖植·偕沈鴻·章慶瀾推事開合議庭冉審、慶餘里房客偕袁蘇等律師出庭、女子銀行亦委律師到庭、上海貧兒敎　院以參加人地位、亦委榮楨隆律師到庭、成都路捕房爲防止發生意外、由華捕頭馮瑞笙督同中西捕到院防範、先由袁律師陳述</p>
<p>再審理由</p>
<p>略稱、女子銀行所以訴令再審原告等遝讓、原根據與貧兒敎養院所簽訂之契的、因爲不於二十七年年底將屋翻造、則女子銀行方面將受二十萬元之損失、今由再審原告查明在原案第二審未辯論終結前、該項契的、已由雙方同意展期三年、在鈞院吊案之證件內、已可證明、是以翻造之期、旣已展期、目將租金减低百分之二十、則其在原審所為之陳述、</p>
<p>全屬虛偽</p>
<p>致使三千餘房客蒙受不利之判决、險遭流離失所之苦、今旣有此强力證據、自應聲請鈞院冉審、將原判廢棄、而爲駁回再審被告聲請之判決云云、繼由庭上飭傳周志伊律師·郭啟明律師。貧兒敎養院院長郭守純到庭證明、確有簽訂展期契的之事實、而女子銀行代表律師則聲明此項契的之簽訂、即因在原契的期滿前必難達到</p>
<p>翻造目的</p>
<p>爲免受二十萬元損失計，遂有此的之訂、然非表示女子銀行無翻造之决意、庭上即勸令雙方和解、母再意氣用事、袁律師表示房客方面始終願意與女子銀行和解、曾屢挽名人等說項、卒遭其拒云云、庭上至此、乃宣告本案改期着令雙方出外試行和解、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>先後</h3>
<p>— 培初</p>
<p>本末，先後，都是我們所應該曉得的，曉得了「則近道矣」，雖然這「道」的界說是難定的。現在，我們且不談本末，談談先後。</p>
<p>其實先後也不過是一種處事的方法。小而言之，譬如個人的身家，就有應該先幹後幹的事，如果先後倒置了，我們的事情就不會成功。至於大而言之，對於國家大事，那允其要審定先後，逐步舉行，旣不能躐等，也不能因循。</p>
<p>不過，假使是大範圍的事情，例如抗戰救國，千頭萬緖，固然要理出一個先後來，而先之中，允須理出先來，則就要我們更加用心想一想了。所以要想一想的原故，自然正對各人的環境，時地的關係而言的。那末就以我們現在在孤島上的人說起來，我們的先中之先究竟是什麼呢？</p>
<p>我以為我們現在第一件要事，是募集並捐出寒衣捐。為什麼的理由，我想也不必要我再在此地詳述吧。天氣已經冷了，不久就要大冷特冷了，我們是穿著得煖煖的，我們應不應為那些沒有寒衣的人打算一下呢？</p>
<p>同一範圍內的事情要辨別其先後，已經是當然的了，而兩個以上不同範圍內的事情，我確信我們也當比較其先後。譬如個人與團體的事情，我們就當以團體的為先，而團體與國家，我們當以國家的為先，也是母容異議的。這樣的比較，也許允在辨別同一範圍內的事情之先吧。</p>
<p>所謂先後，說穿了講，就不過要我們看看事情的重大與吾而巳。重大的就該先，吾則不妨後。我們各人撫心問問吧，現在我們是吾在先其所先？我甘願冒「老生常談」之嫌，請我們大家反省。（移酬寒衣捐）</p>
<h3>荒城</h3>
<p>— 史衛斯</p>
<p>竹葉在溪裏成羣飄向遙遙的晚色，像輕舟遠征，我瞳子裏有了一副落日古渡的秋山。我覺得身比燕輕，欲鴃一抹夕陽追天空的白雲。我開始我的幻想。</p>
<p>幻想，更相宜應說是我自己的足音的再現，對於一個荒城，傍古渡而獨立。是的，躍過萬重山頭，足底下小草的怨語漸低了，我是熟習這道路的。那一頹垣，那一敗墟，那一片黑瓦紅牆，三門嵯峨……。駕着小舟飄過斜陽裏金黃色的微漪罷，我望見了竹簾隱隱的低樓，雖巳是蛛絲繩封，蕭蕭的灰牆上，該猶留下悒　滿懷的一個黑影？</p>
<p>記憶將更淸晰了。兩月的寂寥如墓道中的日子啊！晨有鷄嗚，夜有風把遠遠寒更送上小樓；窗外大好山水却不見一個長者策杖在板橋上向風莞爾；到處只是雀語的痕跡；小門是為竹林封鎖，颯颯作歌，覺得比橋下潺潺流水一樣生凉。我二十歲年靑的心，彷彿巳化身成一迎着秋風掃着落葉的瘦老兒。一帚一帚，掃不盡，一夜秋風，又滿臺階，滿窗下了。</p>
<p>我願躭延於這世界。我愛斜風細雨，對着一盞靑燈，與一個鬱悒的影子。想起的該是那些倦倦的陽光下，爭食着手中灑米的池魚，故園樓閣上的雕闌，十餘年前，穿過一座假山又一座假山，捉着姑姑討鳳仙花的舊夢罷……。有時我眞想為溪的那邊，戴竹笠，垂釣竿，作着巧妙騙術的十數漁人，繪一畫圖。人類中有一大半人是生來作為畫圖中點綴的。想像着携獵槍舉火把爬上山林的勇舉，冒雪躍上冰山風馳電掣的溜滑，夏日竄入水中從揚子江的一頭遊到另一頭，……等等，以及釣魚。（那些事到了我自己手裹，我完全成個笨拙的人。）然而我倒不是望得見陌頭楊柳的閨中少女，懷着征人啊！那畫圖顯得太嬌弱了。我確曾倚窗獨自過着一個早晨又一個早晨的歲月。我要把那頂板橋繪上，人遂顯得那樣卑微，認不淸是誰的面目。</p>
<p>朋友說：再是那樣的一月，你暴躁多感的心，會變成稍淸柔，稍溫靜了！</p>
<p>可是我說，我更懷念另一個荒城！另一個荒城，是的，獨自携了行囊，踽踽而行在沙漠海裏，突然從天際來一陣怪風，身子跟着黃沙一齊滾，停下時不見我的行囊，與行囊裏我一切藉以謀生的財寳！只見一泓淸溪，我照見淸溪裏我自己的怪影子，拔身而走，不顧兩足的疲乏，於是我到了另一荒城。荒城，除了踽踽獨行的一個迷途客的自己的足音，不見一個生人，不見一縷炊烟。現在，翻開你的古書罷，看那些被蠧魚虫蝕了的行列裏，有一段：天寳之亂，或者白蓮敎之殘殺，刀兵到了一處，男女老幼不曾逃走了一個，屠殺完了，走了，於是幾百年，或者幾十年，剩下了一個無人的城子。那就是這荒城！地下草間尙流着中古的血，頹牆殘瓦裏有古人的頭顱。我獨步如回到中世紀之國，跟踪着怪鳥蝴蝶的足影！吿訴你，就在那另一荒城，我徒手創立了另一天地，一重碉堡，一重高樓！</p>
<p>寫到這裏我仍不忘記這只是一幻想。對着靑燈，鋪開白紙，我忽然失望我的幻想之太幼稚！我應如一戰士用實踐解開他的夢，轉變成更大的喜歡呀。可是現實裏，即望着淸溪看竹葉流往遙遙的晚山，也應說是太神經衰弱了。我彷彿一脚踏在輕舟上，飄飄然，另一脚，則在草間被虫豸刺得心痛。</p>
<h3>文人與窮</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>文人自古以來彷彿就和窮結了不解之緣。</p>
<p>在漫長的歷史的勞動過程中，思維勞動與筯肉勞動分離了以後，便失去了它生產的意義；而思維勞動者的文人在一切生活形態上後來更和農民，工人，手工業者，甚至工塲主，地主，商人離遠了。技能呢，歷來不足應付「挑担」或「收稅」，作為中間層的他們總有着悲慘的窮的命運。自然，少數的資產者出身的文人那是又當別論。</p>
<p>司馬相如衣犢鼻褌，似乎是文人莫大的羞恥，但提高喉嚨喊：「燙個本色一碗哉」，原比偷偷在家中寫下封禪文積極一些，這未嘗不可解嘲罷。</p>
<p>自然，眞耍仗着文人的「本色」，還不足以炫世，允其在思維勞動具體而微的結晶（？）——文章成為商品的現代，更不能使文人抬頭呼一口酸氣；即使文章有市價可以立刻在市面拋售罷，常使手兒寫脫了，何况又未必。有些的「登龍」常在文章之外，倒是古今所同慨的。</p>
<p>因此有些文人前輩不時吿誡後生小子：做文人太苦，太苦！意思之間，似要讓悟空八戒們散了伙，捧着衣缽呌化去，別念經了。但這「此路不通」的警吿不過使有志者多喪失些勇氣。文人不可為而為之的，在世界上還不嫌少，明知會染住了窮，一生不够受用，那為何要寫給「文學靑年」的書呢。</p>
<p>於是有人很巧妙的指出了「副業」來補救：寫文章的來一下敎書，敎書的來一下拉車……前者依然文人，後者却給新聞記者做了資料去。但窮還是窮。</p>
<p>有些文人想彌補窮，不免想找個奇妙的副業。譬如：「玩球」罷。用着熟練的思維勞動力來推算這球到底成個什麼的角度，打出來好吾。然而應用在筆下或許是好文章，在塲子裏終有點「那個」，大半是「本錢」不大。（？）結果自然落了空，杜思退夫斯基仍舊是窮光蛋，讓二房東太太來冷諷熱刺。</p>
<p>或許很有和大商人「親善」的念頭，但先要通過「面紅耳赤」的難關，必須多懂些「行情」。</p>
<p>「奇妙的」路不通是當然，因此好些想澈底的「改行」——不走此路如何？爸爸對想做文學家的兒子道：「你得做康白度，才有出息！」這個乾脆得很。但或種胚子似乎不大可以造就，有人聽見了算盤或計算機的音響就不高興，因此也只索罷了。</p>
<p>其實在整個社會機構上看來：「撥算盤」倒不比「動筆桿」更有意思些，雖然後者不一定有益。文人有時撫摩自己底著作，感到莫明的安慰，這是報酬，但並非已盡於此。即使柳永之儔，浪漫成性，而有井水處即有歌詞，未始不可怡然罷，何况卡爾却還够讓自己底勞動結晶來說明世界呢。但遺憾倒是給鹽販子騙去了法書，而掛在人家客廳裏始終給他們撑面子，這也是「難得糊塗」者所無可奈何的。問題是：書法表現不出什麼，淸供而巳。</p>
<p>文人窮，但還有更窮的；自己嘆窮，要暴發嗎——正見一種頹勢。</p>
<p>我們自問：信仰堅定不？——自然「說風涼話」，信仰「金元」這又變得不窮了。同樣，生活規律不？——但祗躱在「齋」中尋字摘句，故意羅織，歪曲，適見自己底心勞，不過有閑（錢）的玩意而巳。</p>
<p>「書生餓死尋常事」，今日的文人自然不比以前的蠢，但路却有絕對相反的：一條是：鍜鍊筋骨（五毛一千稿費無妨，一毛一天生活費還得爬山，怕什麽）；吾則，另外一條是：標賣靈魂。</p>
<p>抗戰之下，文人更顯淸了面目：花白的還是……，窮乎？</p>

<h3>羅靜予携「孤島天堂」赴渝　獻映蔣委員長座前</h3>
<p>— 翠屛</p>
<p>提三項要求解決善後</p>
<p>重慶國立中國電影製片廠技術股股長羅靜予今春來港租借啟明影片公司攝影塲，創組大地影片公司，聘蔡楚生，司徒慧敏，譚友六等名導演，以攝製國防電影為揭　；成立之始，外界胥疑大地即屬中國製片廠之香港分廠，實則全由羅個人籌挪資本，獨力經營，不過有若干機械，係借自重慶中國製片廠。首决出品，為蔡楚生導演，趙英才編劇，黎莉莉·李淸·及中華藝術劇團團員參加合演之「孤島天堂」，該片經四閱月之工作時間，耗港幣四萬元始克完成，片已在港放映，營業紀錄雖高過普通一般國產影片，總以成本過巨，仍有虧蝕之虞。蓋「孤島天堂」初估計一萬五千元可以攝竣，不料超出預算一倍有餘也。故此片完成後，大地公司經濟亦陷於非常拮据之中，巳開拍之第二部片「白雲故鄕」，不得不暫時停頓，因現時「孤島天堂」之收入須儘先付還債主，現羅靜予擬携片至渝，獻映於蔣委員長座前，如蔣委員長觀此片後，認為滿意，足收抗戰宜傳之效，則請委員長破例將「孤島天堂」在四川雲南諸省各地放映之收入，許可買外匯寄港，作大地公司繼續拍片之資金，或請委員長按月接濟公司之經常費若干，再或將大地公司遷往昆明，此種要求，請委員長批准其一，羅靜予已携片至渝，故大地此後拍片工作如何進行，須待羅返港後始有決定也。</p>
<h3>閒談王清塵</h3>
<p>— 劉正鵠</p>
<p>新都劇塲，籌備已久，迄未開幕，前一度盛傳金素琴·林樹森·張翼鵬組班，但終成泡影，現已由醞釀而成事實，內部組織，均吿就緖，擬擇下月一日正式揭幕。羅致名角，胥屬一時之選，聞內定花旦于素蓮，文武老生楊瑞亭，老生王淸塵，武生小趙松樵等，屆時吾人又可一新耳目，惟淸塵離滬日久，恐海上顧曲界已覺陌生，爰誌厓略如次：</p>
<p>按淸塵曾畢業金陵大學，為玩票下海者最早之一，性嗜皮簧，寢饋其中，有悠久之歷史。對譚派各劇，頗具深刻之研究，現年四十八，初習武生，後唱老生，拜老伶工瑞德寳為師，於紥靠戲允擅勝塲。二十年前一度繼小余出演亦舞台，（台主沈少安一名和尙）及第一台，（台主允鴻卿）當時頗獲佳評。後北上再求深造，從名票王君直遊，君直器其才，錄為門牆，舉凡譚氏一字一腔，莫不悉心授之，復虛心私淑小余，幾可亂眞。有一時期，同小雲搭配，彌收綠葉之助。近年藝事精醇唱做更臻純靑之候，歷演津漢各地，所至有聲，者番避水來申，經劉斌崑之介，加入新都與瑞亭合作，堪稱美俱難併，會當與寳森少霖鼎足稱雄也。</p>
<h3>藝壇近事</h3>
<p>王熙春小姐近時躍登銀幕，主演「文素臣二二集攝成試映，成績大佳。合衆公司現將「香妃恨」舞台劇攝為電影，因復聘任主角。並聞自前天起，業於華聯攝影塲開工拍演矣。</p>
<p>靑年名票顧禎祥君，於現票界中，獨以專工小生，名噪一時。演雉尾生風流瀟灑，聲容並茂，允見工力深厚，視兪振飛實難為伯仲。仙霓社崑班，近隸「大羅天一演唱，邀請客串，今晚（二十八）將以初習販馬記」劇登台一試，相與配演者為名旦朱傳茗，珠聯璧合，當甚可觀。</p>
<p>顧蘭君小姐，現將演一五彩影片。劇本定名「歡喜寃家」，係由攝影師顏鶴鳴集資攝製，導演一職聘定李萍倩擔任，男主角為孫敏與劉瓊。據談：此項彩色片，係用「柯達克」特種底片拍演，攝成後準備由航郵運往美國冲洗者，以是飛機遞送，所費至鉅，現作初步嘗試，色片僅攝十分之四，尙非全部五彩云。</p>
<p>陳雲裳小姐之第四部作品「釋迦牟尼」，新華公司亦擬攝為五彩片。辦法係與德籍技師合作，邇時方作商洽，頗有實現可能。（銀絲）</p>
<h3>舞团寫影</h3>
<p>— 小田　（四七）</p>
<p>到香港去</p>
<p>到香港去，也許，到香港去過的舞姝，很有幾位滿載而歸的。在兩天前，我有一位朋友綽號王伯的，接到一位舞姝呌方莉莉的由香港寄來一封信，那封信是由我此地轉遞的，她信裏面說，現在香港舞塲的生意更現着淸淡，物價却比前高漲了幾倍。按理，現在外匯已比前略鬆，物價似乎不應該繼續上漲。至於舞市的淸淡，大概是由於從前由上海去的一班寓公回旆的綠故。</p>
<p>大都會舞星舒蘊蘭和舒蘊珠，在本月卅一日，都要動身到香港去了。她們要到香港去的動機，巳經醞釀了許久，到現在方始成行，可是，未免太遲了些。連日有人替她們餞行，我也叨做過幾决陪客。她們吿訴我，此决前去，訂期三個月，媽媽都跟着同去，川資膳宿，都由舞塲方面供給，薪水一層，還在考慮之中。因為如果要取薪水，相對的條件就是要包若干舞票的。</p>
<p>她們倆俱是未成年的小孩子，蘊珠允其是天眞燜漫，她說，我到了香港，第一封信一定是寫給你的。我問她知道怎麽寫法麽？她就從皮包裏取出一支鉛筆，一本小簿子，開始寫起來了。寫的時候，不讓我看，寫完了纔遞給我，我覺得非常可愛，同時不禁啞然失笑，她寫的是「師父大人膝下，敬禀者，拜別尊顏，曷勝孺慕……」，我說，你一定在學校裏念過幾年書的，這是敎科書上抄下來的嗎？但你這膝下兩個字用錯了，這兩字祗能對你父母用的。她說，師父不是同爸爸一樣的嗎。為什麽不能用呢？對師父應該用什麼呢？我覺得這孩子很好，學做一舞女眞是可惜，當時就吿訴她一點依依膝下的道理，並且引證了一段老萊子斑衣承歡的故事給她聽，她很能領悟，但是關於夫子大人函丈的意義，我想她恐怕未必能懂，所以祗敎她寫師父大人尊前，又敎了她幾句寫信慣用的成語。飯後到大都會，看見她在伴舞的餘暇，常常用鉛筆在紙上畫來畫去，我想有許多有錢上學的孩子，為什麽還要常常賴學呢。</p>
<p>「文素臣」影片中之湖上遇舊（下）洞房一文素臣（劉瓊飾）劉璇姑（楊文英飾）</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>這時惜姣業已被宋三爺殺死了，情斷義斷，怎會再把價約三百兩紋銀的黃金一錠賞給閻婆子的呢？所以我才敢判斷那必是另外的十兩紋銀，別看許多唱　生的常演這齣戲，倘使他不把劇情揣摩淸楚，或是只知其當然而不知其所以然的話，我想他一定也會把賞給閻婆買棺木的十兩紋銀，誤成那是剛由惜妓屍體懷裏取出的那錠黃金的。我們既然抱定硏究戲劇的宗旨，所以對於這些小的地方，也不可忽略。</p>
<h3>殺子報與殺父奇案</h3>
<p>「殺子報」一名「南通奇案」。從前這齣戲也曾哄動一時。後來官方因為此劇的前段。事涉淫靡。有傷風化。所以曾經明令禁演。况且這齣戲唱作都無甚精彩。演者多屬只能演花旦戲小八齣之坤伶。著名男且均不屑演之。迨近年以來，坤旦如雪艷琴新艷秋等力爭上流。技藝足與男伶媲美。此種無足重輕之小戲。縱官方不予制止。若單亦必不願以是劇號召顧客也。</p>
<p>按該劇的劇情，是母殺其子，並將其屍體刴成八斷置之　中，此事可謂殘忍已極。乃不圖若干年後之今日，上海又有子殺其父之逆倫奇案。且殺後亦用支解方法，預備裝置箱中，希圖滅蹟。總觀此兩案，好似前後遙遙相對。最令人不可解者，乃該二事竟均出之於文化最盛敎育最發達之蘇省。南通素號模範縣，上海又為人文薈萃，中外觀瞻所繫的特殊區，距南通亦不甚遙。今竟先後有此殘酷暴戾的事情，相繼發生。這也不能不歸咎於吾國敎育之不良及舊道德日漸廢弛，斯有以致之了。（一二九）</p>

<h3>Hunan-North China Troops Penetrate Deep into Japanese Rear, Advancing Towards Yanglousi and Puqi; Intense Fighting as Japanese Invade Zhuhe City Southeast of Jianli; Chinese and Japanese Armies Confronting Each Other in the Suburbs of Yueyang and Tongcheng</h3>
<p>Bolu: For the past two days, Chinese and Japanese armies have been in a state of confrontation in the suburbs of Yueyang and Tongcheng. Chinese troops penetrating deep into the Japanese rear are advancing towards Yanglousi and Puqi around the evening of the 26th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: In the areas of Fengxin and Jing’an, Chinese and Japanese armies were still confronting each other in the suburbs on the 27th. In the area of Wuning, starting on the 26th, the Chinese forces split into two routes, one attacking Changlunshan, killing many Japanese soldiers, and the other launching a counterattack from Putianqiao against over a hundred Japanese soldiers harassing the west of Wuning city.

<h3>Jin China Army Captures Doucun Town</h3>
<p>Xingji: The Wutai People's Resistance Guard has been very active recently. The Doucun Town to Shuzhuang highway has been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese. Cooperating with a certain Chinese unit, they attacked Doucun Town on the 22nd. The Japanese army retreated in panic. The Chinese army then recaptured Doucun Town. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Various newspapers here report that the Japanese army is now re-initiating attacks in Shanxi Province, adopting an encirclement strategy against the Chinese army in Puxian, southwest of Shanxi Province, with the aim of "eliminating" the Chinese army operating in that area. (27th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Invading Su Suffers Repeated Heavy Blows</h3>

The Chinese army, while firmly resisting, launched a fierce attack on the Japanese flanks and rear. After a day of intense fighting, over two hundred and eighty Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese, unable to withstand the attacks, fled in a disheveled manner. In this battle, the Chinese side captured many rifles, machine guns, ammunition, and military supplies. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>China's Determination to Resist Japan Grows Stronger Recently; British Ambassador's Meeting with Chiang Has Nothing to Do with Mediation; American Ambassador Unwilling to Talk About False Peace</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the peace rumors, it is learned from responsible sources that China has decided to continue the war of resistance until the final victory is achieved. This determination has grown stronger recently, as successive victories have been reported on various fronts, and support from friendly nations has also become increasingly active. The remarks made recently by US Secretary of State Hull and US Ambassador to Japan Grew have aroused admiration throughout China. Political figures believe that China will never negotiate peace with Japan unless Japan withdraws its troops stationed in China, and China will never accept mediation unless a third country guarantees the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Therefore, the general public does not believe that the recent talks between British Ambassador Kerr and Chairman Chiang have anything to do with mediation and peace. In addition, it is said that US Ambassador Johnson, since returning to his post several months ago, has been stationed in Chongqing. He once said that he hoped to see China continue the war of resistance until victory is achieved, and that he was unwilling to obtain a false peace through mediation. (27th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter from the Central News Agency, noting that the Japanese side has recently been spreading rumors in an attempt to disturb the Chinese people's hearts, and although relevant parties have repeatedly denied them, they are still circulating externally, specially visited Zhu Shiming, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for inquiries. He replied as follows: The Japanese have recently encountered unprecedented military setbacks and feel deeply unable to continue supporting themselves economically. Under these circumstances, they can only use deceptive propaganda, specializing in creating rumors, attempting to alleviate the grievances of their people at home on the one hand, and to cover up their predicament in the international community on the other. Their ultimate goal is to use rumors to shake China's unwavering will to resist Japan. Taking only the past month as an example, the rumors they have systematically fabricated are too numerous to count. Their rumors about Sino-Soviet and Sino-British relations have been vehemently refuted by Secretary-General Zhu of the Central Party Headquarters. Recently, they spread the rumor that the National Government entrusted US Ambassador to China Johnson to convey peace proposals to Japan on behalf of the US government, which has also been officially denied by the US authorities. We can only call this kind of trick a rumor offensive. The most clumsy ones are the rumors about the actions of our military and political leaders. In fact, these leaders are either commanding operations at the front or performing their duties as usual in Chongqing, as proven by the facts. The Japanese side even fabricated claims that Chongqing has begun informal peace talks with their representatives, which is truly absurd and ridiculous. We do not need to fear Japan's "rumor offensive" because we believe that facts will ultimately defeat rumors. The rumor offensive will fail completely, just like its military aggression. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It is claimed here that although the Chinese government is currently focused on resisting Japan, it is not indifferent to the international situation. As of now, China maintains a position of absolute neutrality towards the warring countries in Europe and still hopes that Europe can turn swords into ploughshares to maintain European order and culture. At the same time, China's strength to resist Japan can also be enhanced as a result. Therefore, the Chinese authorities are now making great efforts to crack down on foreign propaganda that could undermine China's neutral position, and the Information Department has notified all newspapers that their remarks must be impartial and maintain pure neutrality.

<h3>Yang Huimin Recuperating in Chengdu; Former Girl Scout Who Braved the Line of Fire in Shanghai to Present the National Flag to the Lone Army</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Lone Army's resistance in the Shanghai Sihang Warehouse battle. Newspapers here all carried special commentaries. Ms. Yang Huimin, the former girl scout who braved the line of fire to present the national flag to the Lone Army, was recently injured in a car accident and is recuperating in a hospital in Chengdu. She is gradually recovering and sent a special telegram from the hospital yesterday to pay tribute to the Lone Army. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Xi'an: Japanese aircraft harassed Shaanxi twice on the morning of the 26th. The first batch, one aircraft, slipped through from Jin at 8:05 AM to spy on the Xi'an Fengxiang area. Another batch of seventeen aircraft slipped into Xi'an at 9:20 AM, dropping dozens of bombs before fleeing eastward. The Chinese side suffered no losses. Seven aircraft slipped to Xianyang to spy and dropped one bomb before fleeing. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese in China Number Over 260,000</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to statistics released by Japanese officials, there are currently 262,000 Japanese people in China, including Inner Mongolia, a threefold increase compared to 1937, when there were only 87,000. (27th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Prisoners in Guizhou Province Enjoy a Life of Luxury; Foreign Reporters Have Photographed Them</h3>
<p>Guilin: Forty-eight Japanese prisoners of war are enjoying a peaceful, quiet, and fulfilling life in Guangxi Province, an anti-Japanese stronghold under the rule of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Although Li and Bai lead troops to resist Japan's control of China with all their might, the Japanese soldiers captured in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces enjoy comfort and freedom in Guizhou Province, which reporters have not witnessed elsewhere in China. The Guangxi provincial authorities' preferential treatment of Japanese prisoners of war is reflected in the attitude of the Japanese prisoners. The attitude of the Japanese prisoners I have seen elsewhere is unpleasant, depressed, and silent, and they oppose invading the places where they live. However, the Japanese prisoners in Guizhou Province welcome talking to foreign reporters, as two of them can speak English. After their physical education time was over, when we asked to take pictures of them, four Japanese soldiers scrambled to perform wrestling matches, and two other teams played basketball. Two large courtyards are used exclusively for Japanese prisoners' gymnastics, and there is another large sports field for them to play ball games and tennis. During exercise time, there are only two Chinese guards protecting the two-acre (equivalent to thirteen mu in China) area, surrounded by high walls. The Chinese guards watching the ball games are more excited than the Japanese prisoners sitting on the grass. The Japanese prisoners are all subject to strict discipline, and they are so busy all day that they cannot get an opportunity to rebel. The Japanese prisoners read Chinese literature and anti-war propaganda compiled by the Japanese left-wing writer Watari Kaji. According to a certain Chinese, a graduate of Waseda University in Japan who is currently the director of the prisoner-of-war camp, the Chinese authorities plan to train the Japanese prisoners to write anti-war propaganda, which will be distributed to the Japanese army by guerrillas, and to train other Japanese prisoners. Although the Japanese prisoners receive roughly the same treatment, Japanese officers receive more courtesy and food than soldiers. Japanese officers and soldiers who voluntarily defect receive better treatment and greater freedom. Each Sunday, each prisoner receives a small package of cigarettes, and those who win sports games receive some sweets as a reward. A Japanese waitress captured by guerrillas in Guangdong Province, although there are forty-eight Japanese prisoners willing to fall at her pomegranate skirt, she does not want to accept them in her heart. The director of the prisoner-of-war camp claimed that she is separated from the male prisoners, but during the day she accompanies the male prisoners, and said, "If she falls in love with a certain Japanese prisoner, we will try our best to help them get together. If they want to get married, we are very willing to help." However, the hope of getting married in the prisoner-of-war camp did not arouse her interest. When the reporter spoke to the Japanese prisoners who could speak English, he felt that they were very interested in the world situation. A Japanese prisoner who used to be a wine merchant in Kobe claimed that he knew that war had broken out in Europe and asked the reporter, "Is that accurate?" After the reporter told him that it was accurate, he continued to ask "Why?" The reporter told him, "There is no time to talk about the course of the war." He then replied, "Just like Japan's war against China." It is said that the number of Japanese soldiers captured in various parts of China reaches more than one thousand. The reporter saw two hundred of them, and the life of the Japanese prisoners in Guizhou Province is the most lively and pleasant, perhaps because they enjoy Guangxi's excellent sunshine, food freedom, and no need to defend themselves against the danger of attacks from Chinese troops everywhere.

<h3>A Japanese Troop Train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Destroyed by Bombing; Over a Hundred Officers and Soldiers Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>Jinhua: At 8 AM on the morning of the 24th, a certain Chinese unit buried explosives near Zhujiaqiao, between Chang'an and Xieqiao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. A Japanese troop train happened to be traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou and detonated the explosives. One locomotive and twelve carriages were completely destroyed. Over a hundred Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese took the opportunity to attack. The Japanese resisted stubbornly, but after being subjected to intense Chinese gunfire, they retreated. The destroyed vehicles were removed by the 25th. Because the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been constantly sabotaged and attacked by the Chinese, troop trains have been bombed twice in half a month, causing extreme panic. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Provincial Government Convenes Commissioners' Meeting; Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chengdu: The Sichuan Provincial Commissioners' Meeting opened on the morning of the 27th. Present were Secretary-General of the Provincial Government He Guoguang, as well as department heads, provincial commissioners, and over twenty other people. He Guoguang chaired the meeting and delivered a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang, who concurrently manages Sichuan politics, first stating the significance of convening the commissioners' meeting: (1) Since Chairman Chiang began concurrently managing Sichuan politics, it is necessary to convene the commissioners to clarify the meaning of the policy guidelines. (2) Because of the transition between the old and new years, it is necessary to listen to the reports of the commissioners to provide a basis for reviewing the past and planning for the future. (3) Because of the need to promote special and important policies with time constraints, it is necessary to explain their meaning and discuss effective methods to avoid delays. He then made two points of hope to the commissioners: 1. Carefully study the policy guidelines; 2. Strictly abide by the matters listed in Chairman Chiang's letter to the people of Sichuan. After He's speech, Deng Xihou delivered a speech on behalf of the party, government, and military leaders, followed by speeches from the heads of various departments. In the afternoon, reports from the commissioners were heard. The meeting will continue on the 28th and is scheduled to open on the evening of the 28th. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fifty-Third Birthday</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's fifty-third birthday. There is no extravagance. Few people know about it. Madam Chiang got up very early this morning to give a broadcast speech to the United States at the request of the New York office. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Poverty Relief</h3>
<p>Speaking of the general life today, it can truly be called the extraordinary life of an extraordinary period. Since "control" has taken the reins, speculation has stirred up waves, merchants have added to the surge, the European war has lengthened the flow, and prices are like a prairie fire, with an unstoppable momentum. Changing daily, with ever-increasing prices, the longer it lasts, the more difficult the general life becomes. Not to mention poor families, who all sigh and look to the sky. Even households that could barely support themselves by working and raising livestock in normal times are also at a loss, lamenting the difficulty of living in Chang'an. Moreover, with frost about to fall, leaves thinning, the north wind rising, and severe winter approaching, those who earn their living by physical labor have no storage of grain or cloth at home, and their rooms are filled with the sounds of cold and hunger. How can they not weep facing each other in their cowsheds? As for those who have lost their jobs or been displaced due to war, wandering the streets, sheltering under eaves, enduring hunger and cold, allowing nature to dictate their survival, trembling like cattle and sheep in the hall. Looking around, the neon lights are dazzling, the licentious sounds disturb the ears, heavy furs are not warm, red stoves are still cold, gorging on delicacies and savoring fine foods, picking the best and selecting the fat. By comparison, the disparity between suffering and happiness is so great. This environment is like the mischievous tricks of a child of fortune, making humans enjoy different degrees of favor. All of this is wrong. It is probably because the policy of poverty relief has not been launched early, and the heart of compassion has been contained and not expressed.</p>
<p>The world is indeed not lacking those who cherish the hungry and drowning. But rescuing them after they are already hungry and drowning is not as good as planning for them before they are hungry and drowning. There are many men and women in Shanghai who are righteous, courageous, benevolent, and generous. The collection of winter clothing the year before last resulted in tens of thousands of items being collected in no time. How benevolent and brave their actions were! If one must wait for entertainment before donating, dancing before opening their purses, then compared to those who are unwilling to part with a single hair and are reluctant even when forced, it is still slightly better. Speaking of relief, a large sum of money is needed. Where will the money come from? It still relies on the support of the masses. If we can save on unnecessary consumption, waste on cigarettes, alcohol, fruits, and snacks, and use it for poverty relief and helping the masses, then the gains may not be small. Do we not see that the value of imported fruits such as tangerines and apples, as well as cigarettes, alcohol, perfumes, powders, and snow creams, in the first, second, and third quarters of this year amounted to a huge 42.84 million yuan? However, this is still calculated according to the central government's exchange rate for customs gold units. If converted according to the black market rate, it would be two or three times that value. There are countless other categories of imported consumables of this kind. China has been resisting Japan for more than two years, and its land is scarred and its cities are in ruins. Yet the people are still rushing after the desires of the mouth and belly, and the pleasures of the senses, living drunkenly and dreaming of death, without thinking of being vigilant. Is this not the greatest sorrow, the death of the heart, and beyond salvation? Fortunately, this is only the case for a small number of wealthy people who disregard the seriousness of the national crisis and continue to live their extravagant lives. There are also those who have become rich through hoarding and speculation, enjoying their ill-gotten gains without any thrift, forgetting themselves in their joy, and only seeking the pleasure of the mouth and belly. These people, living in society, are no different from parasitic worms, squandering at will, which is not to be regretted, but their individual losses are still small. However, they create a social atmosphere of luxury, increasing the burden of national expenditure, and their harm is great. If they can slightly restrain their desires, slightly reduce their extravagance, and reduce the consumption of fruits, cigarettes, alcohol, and other items by several million yuan, it would not hinder their necessary life. Furthermore, if they can take what they save and use it for social undertakings, then society will be stable. If they use it for industry and commerce, then all industries will prosper, so that everyone can enjoy their work, live in peace, and die without regret. What problem would poverty relief still be?</p>
<p>It is only because they cannot, and poverty relief must still wait for persuasion to be launched, fundraising to be collected, encouragement to be achieved, and pity to be aroused. And there are still those who turn a deaf ear and look away. Benevolence is inherent in everyone, and even a sense of compassion is something that everyone has. Compassion is the great sympathy of mankind. Jesus preached universal love, Islam emphasized almsgiving, Buddhism emphasized compassion and relief, and Confucianism emphasized universal love and kindness. Times may differ, regions may be far or near, but the principle is the same. Their commitment to saving people is also the same. If everyone takes the heart of Jesus, Islam, Buddhism, and Confucianism as their own, poverty relief will no longer be a problem. However, there are those who think that they do not need to be saved by others, and they do not show sympathy for the poor. There are also those who float and sink in the sea of desires, drowning without knowing how to save themselves, thinking that poverty has nothing to do with them. By the time they suddenly awaken, they realize that saving others and saving themselves are no different from the beginning, but it is already too late. Therefore, only those who feel the pain of cold and hunger themselves can have a spontaneous sense of sympathy for poverty relief. But often limited by their circumstances, they have more than enough heart but not enough strength, so they wear down their enthusiasm invisibly, watching their compatriots suffer in water and fire. As for the utterly poor, they cannot even take care of themselves, and feel even more helpless. From this, we can say that the implementation of poverty relief in practice is still a problem.</p>
<p>However, the problem of poverty relief is a major problem among social problems. Passive relief, which provides temporary comfort, is still a superficial solution. Active relief, which prevents people from suffering from poverty, is the fundamental solution. But in the current dangerous environment and difficult life, being able to do passive relief is already fortunate. In this corner of the sea, today there are countless people who do not have enough food and clothing, and who live each day like a year. There are countless more who have no clothes to cover their bodies, no food to fill their stomachs, no place to shelter from the cold, and no way to beg for food. When the north wind blows and snow falls, will we bear to watch them sleep on the side of the road and become starving corpses, or will we lend a hand so that they can barely survive, and have the possibility of resuming their normal lives or returning to their hometowns to live in peace when the war ends and prices fall? This is the responsibility of the public, and it is a duty that cannot be shirked. As the Book of Changes says, a family that accumulates good deeds will surely have abundant blessings, and a family that accumulates evil deeds will surely have abundant calamities. There are many poor people in Shanghai, but there are also many rich people. If they embrace the determination to do good and not lag behind others, and use their surplus to make up for the deficiencies of others, then poverty relief would not be difficult. As for the discussion of general living problems, that should be reserved for another discussion.</p>
<h3>The United States' Anti-Aggression Stance Strengthens China's Determination to Resist Japan; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Gratitude in a Broadcast to the United States; Hopes for More Effective Action Against Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the invitation of the New York Herald Tribune Forum, broadcasted to the United States today. Madame Chiang expressed her regret that democratic countries did not interfere with Japan, believing that this attitude emboldened Japan to launch its conquest of China. However, Madame Chiang expressed her gratitude to the United States, as its stance had opened a ray of light for China, leading them to believe that the United States would eventually settle accounts with the aggressor, thus inspiring and encouraging their anti-Japanese spirit.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang said in her speech, "Eight years ago, Japan, without any reason or declaration of war, suddenly launched a large-scale invasion of our northeastern provinces, and then seized them for its own. Treaties were torn up, international law was trampled upon, and other democratic countries were threatened. However, the democratic countries turned a blind eye and did nothing. At that time, we had a firm belief in the inviolability of the League of Nations and treaties, so we remained unmoved. But our belief was shattered by reality. I believe you must feel the same way. The democratic countries' inaction in the face of China's invasion has allowed other ambitious nations around the world to seize the opportunity. The armies of these countries have taken advantage of the inaction of democratic countries to annex many free and democratic nations in various parts of the world. Not only that, but Japan, seeing this situation, its desire for conquest greatly increased, and soon its iron hooves and bombs appeared in mainland China. In the past two years and several months, Japan has spared no effort to destroy us. What we have relied on to resist the Japanese is only our own strength. Although our strength is weak compared to the Japanese, we have still inflicted blows on the Japanese. We are still fighting with the Japanese. The Western democratic countries have abandoned the treaties they themselves drafted to protect humanity and the sovereignty, independence, and integrity of China, so our trust in the West cannot but be shaken. However, our work of resistance will continue. China, which upholds the dignity of treaties, is now being abandoned by others, while the aggressor, who has openly opposed civilization and democratic countries, is still being assisted by the United States with gasoline, aircraft, and mechanized weapons to destroy the lives and homes of our people. How should we feel about this phenomenon? Only the US government has given us a ray of light and encouragement, making us know that the aggressor will eventually be held accountable by the United States. This is what we deeply appreciate about the United States. The recent US action to abolish the US-Japan commercial treaty is the initial action of the United States to condemn Japan's cunning and brutality. The Chinese people now hope that the United States' condemnation of Japan's aggression and the use of force as a national policy will not be limited to mere condemnation, and that the action will be based on Ambassador Grew's speech last week. For years, I have often said that the Japanese people who are kept in the dark should be given a frank warning. We hope that other democratic countries can be so candid. The long-suffering Chinese people now only hope that the United States can refuse to help the Japanese destroy the lives and property of the Chinese people with a solemn attitude, so as to strengthen the position of Ambassador Grew's statement. In a nutshell, the United States must not participate in Japan's actions to destroy China. It is very easy for the United States not to participate in Japan's actions to destroy China, simply by not facilitating the various materials and tools that Japan uses to conduct its cruel war against China. This is our responsibility. We feel that this request is extremely justified, because otherwise, it is tantamount to acknowledging that civilization has perished and that human desire has replaced God. If everything is based on expediency, then the door of diplomacy will not have the place of religion. Religion is the cornerstone of civilization. Without religion, there is no international justice, no righteousness, no guarantee for promises, and no belief in treaties. Treaties that are not governed by religion are in danger of being abandoned and destroyed at any time. Therefore, if human civilization does not want to perish completely, we must find a way to restore the loyalty and piety of the medieval Crusaders. We must regain the noble principles upon which democracy is based, and then human freedom and human rights will not be destroyed. In short, without religion, no country can last long. If those who conclude treaties all take religious principles as the standard, then there will be no breach of contract. Our women have a great responsibility for the restoration of peace. In this era when civilization is on the verge of collapse, it is the time for us to serve. In the history of human evolution, the amount of social contribution and the strength applied is used as a measure. Our women must not ignore this point, but must pay attention to it. There is no stagnation in the world. We must carry the cross with the spirit of the Crusaders and move forward incessantly. Unless a great change can take place in the human heart, then I dare say that the destruction of civilization must be in our generation. As for the way of its destruction, it will be no different from the cruel war that China has suffered. Only religion can save this catastrophe. In other words, both national consciousness and individual consciousness can be developed, and if we believe in religion and take religion as the rudder to govern our lives and actions, then there is hope for saving the catastrophe of civilization."

<h3>Japan Eagerly Seeks to Adjust Relations with Britain and the United States; Negotiations to Be Held in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun", Foreign Minister Nomura will not only hold negotiations with US Ambassador Grew in a short period of time to adjust US-Japan relations, but will also hold talks with British Ambassador Craigie to improve British-Japanese relations. Nomura's appointment as Foreign Minister is indeed determined to improve Japan's relations with various third countries. The newspaper also said that the Foreign Minister's talks with the British Ambassador will not only be a continuation of the Tianjin Incident roundtable conference, but will also strive to resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Whether US-Japan relations will turn for the better or worse will be decided in the middle of next week. According to news from informed sources, US Ambassador Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura will hold important talks next week. The US government has repeatedly expressed its determination to maintain its rights in the Far East, so the shift in US-Japan relations will depend entirely on Japan's attitude and whether it can fulfill its promises.

<h3>The Three Major Principles of the United States in the Far East; McNutt Speech; Retention of the Philippines</h3>
<p>New York - Former US High Commissioner to the Philippines and current Federal Security Administrator McNutt, at the invitation of the New York Herald Tribune Forum, delivered a radio speech tonight, stating that the United States should retain sovereignty over the Philippines and maintain the democratic foundation of the Philippine government in times of crisis. McNutt advocated that the Philippines should be granted full autonomy, while foreign affairs, tariffs, currency, and public debt should still be controlled by the United States. Regarding the issue of the US defense line in the Pacific, McNutt believed that the solution to this question depended on whether the United States would withdraw from the Far East. If the majority of Americans advocate withdrawal, then the United States should resolutely and completely withdraw. However, if the United States withdraws from the Far East, then the three major principles that the United States has always advocated will be abandoned: (1) the Open Door Policy, (2) the integrity of China's territorial rights, and (3) most importantly, freedom of the seas and freedom of the air will also be sacrificed. "However, if we do not withdraw from the Far East, then we should still remain in the Philippines, and I dare say that if we can slightly hint to the Filipinos, then the Philippines will ask us to stay in the Philippines." McNutt also said that the Far East is now in sorrow and suffering, but the Philippines is a paradise where democracy and peace can govern everything, and its democracy is advancing day by day. If the United States withdraws from the Far East, then the United States will have no say in the future of the Far East. Therefore, our task is to ensure the security and stability of the US position in the Philippines. (United Press dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3>India-Japan Consultations</h3>
<p>New Delhi - Japanese Consul General Yoshimatsu, the Japanese government representative for the India-Japan consultations, visited the Indian representative at the Indian Viceroy's House on the 26th and held the first India-Japan talks.

(2) No date will be predetermined for the talks, and talks will be held anytime and anywhere if necessary. (Domei dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>The Information Reported by the Japanese Side Is All Groundless</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Japanese Domei News Agency reported that He Yaozu had flown to Moscow two weeks ago to sign a military alliance with the Soviet Union, but in fact, He is currently still in Chongqing. Domei also reported that Shao Lizi had gone to Yan'an to meet Mao Zedong to mediate the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but in the past few days, Shao has been attending various meetings and asked reporters what they thought of this absurd statement. As for Zhou Enlai, the liaison officer between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he is still in Yan'an and has not gone to Moscow. General Zhu De is still on the front lines in Shanxi, commanding guerrilla warfare. (Associated Press dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Announces Administrative Guidelines</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Henan - Wei Lihuang, the newly appointed Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, arrived here from Luoyang on the 25th to take office. Various sectors held a warm welcome meeting. Wei announced his administrative guidelines to reporters, roughly as follows: All future measures will be in accordance with the instructions of the President. In terms of management in Henan, we will strive for rationalization, clean governance, and the educational aspect will be centered on the needs of wartime education as the goal of promoting education. Economically, we must strive to break the excuse of economic poverty as an obstacle to construction. In terms of defense, we must strive to maintain law and order in the complete areas, improve the Baojia system, and prepare all mobilization work. In the occupied areas, we must universally launch anti-Japanese self-defense guerrilla work, and strengthen the organization and training of the people, and fully utilize the strength of the people to protect the local areas. Regarding the methods for promoting Henan's politics, first, politics should be coordinated with military affairs, and military affairs should assist politics. Second, concentrate all human and material resources on the (most urgent) basic work that is beneficial to the anti-Japanese war. Third, all undertakings should seek a balanced development of quality and quantity. Finally, he hopes that the people of Henan will cultivate good political habits in the great anti-Japanese war.

<h3>The Pope Issues an Encyclical Condemning Power Politics, Advocating the Promotion of Human Conscience and Adherence to Natural International Laws</h3>
<p>Vatican City - Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical yesterday, upholding the natural rights of human conscience and denouncing totalitarianism, stating in part, "Bringing mankind to submission cannot be achieved by swords, but only by respecting the natural rights of mankind and following the guidance of Heaven. On the contrary, taking the state as the ultimate goal and making everything subservient to it can only hinder the true and lasting prosperity of all nations. If the rulers of various countries regard themselves as the masters of the state and disregard the rights of mankind and various cultural and institutional systems, how can they speak of true and lasting prosperity? Divine right is the foundation of true right. A certain country does not recognize the existence of divine right, and places mankind outside of divine right, and replaces it with utilitarianism. This action violates all the principles of natural religion and goes against the conscience of Christianity. Nothing is more absurd than this. The freedom of conscience that mankind should enjoy is sacred and inviolable. If this kind of right is deliberately destroyed, then the mutual trust between people and even between nations will be lost, and as a result, all promises will not be trusted by the world, and the solution to all disputes will only rely on force, and will no longer be based on reason and justice. These countries have abandoned the idea that human authority is inherited from God, so the bonds of human connection and affection have been forgotten, which is very painful. As for the family, since the beginning of human history, it has fulfilled its sacred mission. Various totalitarian countries, dissatisfied with Christian thought, have destroyed the family system. How can they know that people and families existed long before the establishment of the state? If various countries want to establish harmonious and lasting relations, the main condition is that all people acknowledge and abide by natural international laws. According to this law, the independent rights of all countries, as well as their right to survive and gradually evolve through civilized means, should be respected. All existing treaties should also be faithfully fulfilled in accordance with justice and righteousness. As for the position of the Church, it has always been willing to help the world with the spirit of Christ, and has made many efforts to prevent war, but the tragedy of bloodshed has already occurred, and the Polish nation has already tasted the pain. All my Christians must pray devoutly so that mankind can be comforted." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Pope issued his long-awaited encyclical today, saying that the reason why the world has fallen into today's catastrophe is due to the lack of respect for promises, the spread of militarism, and the lack of trust between nations. The Pope also criticized the autonomy of the state, saying that this is a violation of natural reason and the principles of Christian conscience. The state may demand all the property of the people, but it can never demand the souls of the people. He hopes that after the war is over, we will avoid the mistakes of the past. The new order must be based on natural law and the revelation of God. After all the convenient methods of mankind have failed miserably, the way to save the world can only be found in the White Church. (Reuters dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Refutes German Foreign Minister's Attempt to Sow Discord Between Britain and France as Extremely Foolish</h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax, speaking in the House of Lords today on the international situation, mentioned the speech of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, saying that he had never seen a plot to sow discord between Britain and France that was so clumsy. The gist of the entire speech seemed to be devoted to sowing discord between Britain and France, but he did not know that the close mutual trust between Britain and France today is unprecedented. It only made people feel that Ribbentrop neither understood the British people in peacetime nor the united psychology of Britain and France. His so-called innocent Germany being threatened by Czechoslovakia and Poland one after another, and being a victim of British conspiracy, only made gods and men laugh together. The Foreign Secretary then replied to the suggestion that British-Soviet commercial relations should be restored, saying that in order to make a correct observation of the overall situation, there is something that we cannot forget. The Soviet Union's recent actions in the Baltic Sea have caused anxiety not only to those directly related to it. The situation it has created is not clear. The recent state of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is still unclear. If the negotiations are stalled, it will have repercussions in and around the Scandinavian peninsula, which cannot be foreseen now. As far as we know, there are no irreconcilable conflicts of interest between the Soviet Union and Finland. The British government hopes that the current negotiations can achieve a suitable ending. Halifax also said that although the Soviet government's declaration of economic solidarity with Germany seems to make it impossible for it to trade with the warring countries on the same terms, the Soviet Union is now willing to trade with the warring countries with an impartial attitude. The British government has already taken advantage of this attitude and concluded an agreement with it to exchange timber for rubber and tin. We are now studying the possibility of extending trade on this mutual exchange basis, in order to benefit Britain without danger. In the current environment, the barter method is the only possible basis. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>London - Liberal Party leader Sinclair said in the House of Commons today that the Liberal Party supports the Prime Minister's attitude towards Ribbentrop's speech. The Liberal Party advocates that the British government should improve relations with the Soviet Union and not allow it to remain in its current unsatisfactory or dangerous state. Progress should be made in the commercial aspect. If the Soviet Union is forced to unite with Germany to develop its own destiny, then the Soviet Union will certainly be able to do so. The British government should take active action, starting with commerce, and then moving on to diplomacy, so that the Soviet government understands that for the sake of the Soviet Union's interests, and for the general interests of mankind, it is best to establish an understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain and France as soon as possible.

<h3>Roosevelt's Radio Address Vigorously Avoids Being Drawn Into the Vortex, Denies Sending Children to Europe to Participate in the War, But Is Absolutely Unable to Remain Neutral in Thought</h3>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt, at the invitation of the forum magazine here last night, delivered a radio speech, stating roughly, "Speakers can be divided into two categories." One is a faithful speaker who can use truth and reason as his destination, and the other is good at stimulating the enthusiasm and prejudices of the audience. This must be distinguished by each audience. For several weeks, American newspapers and radio stations have been reporting on international issues in an objective manner. It is also a good thing that the United States Congress is occasionally invaded by organized propaganda movements, because what is the difference between the will automatically expressed by the electorate and the propaganda movement seeking help from the masses? Members of Congress have now begun to realize this. We often hear speakers and commentators in and outside Congress making meaningless disputes, or even falsely claiming that the government is about to send troops to Europe to fight, and then expressing their opposition. This is the most hateful slander in modern history. In fact, no responsible person from the federal government, state government, or municipal government has ever advocated sending children to Europe. This kind of dishonest and shameful lie must be condemned. The position of our country in the international situation is very simple and cannot be swayed by alarming words or seeking help from prejudices. In short, our country is a neutral country and does not want to be drawn into the vortex of war. I have stated this. However, although we are conservatively neutral in action, we cannot be conservatively neutral in thought. After the people of our country have put aside their prejudices and calmly thought about the events that have occurred on other continents, they have already gained a kind of understanding of right and wrong. In addition, various news items are being objectively reported by various newspapers and radio stations, and the thoughts and judgment of the men and women citizens of our country will therefore become more and more acute, and they will be able to distinguish between truth and lies. Lies can be spread endlessly, but they will never become the truth." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>The King of Belgium Speaks, Determined to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Brussels - King Leopold III, at the request of the New York Forum magazine, delivered a radio speech at 2:15 AM today, declaring Belgium's determination to maintain neutrality, saying, "Our country issued a statement in October 1937, maintaining its independent status, and it was recognized by its three major neighbors. These countries also provided solemn guarantees, willing to respect our country's territory and guarantee our country's independence. Since the outbreak of this war, our country has also declared neutrality. Our country and the Netherlands have now formed peaceful islands, which should be preserved for the benefit of all countries. Now, we pray to God not to let our country be attacked, but if other countries violate their promises, we will not hesitate to deal with them." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<h3>The United States Legislates to Amend the Neutrality Act, the Senate Submits the Proposal to a Vote, Seven Proposals Are Rejected, Six</h3>
<p>Washington - The Senate today voted on Senator Towne's proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act. Generally, this is considered the first test of strength for those who want to abolish the arms embargo. The government has now won. According to this amendment, it should be prohibited to sell arms to foreign countries in peacetime or wartime, regardless of whether they are neutral countries or warring countries, except for countries in the Western Hemisphere that are at war with non-American countries. This proposal was rejected by a vote of 55 to 27. (Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate continued to discuss the Pittman Neutrality Bill today and submitted seven proposed amendments to a vote, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Proposed by Republican Senator Topp, advocating prohibiting foreign ships from flying the American flag or impersonating American ships, and those who violate this will be prohibited from entering American territorial waters and ports within three months. The Senate immediately approved it by a show of hands. (2) A joint proposal by Republican Senators Tannheh and Vandenberg, advocating prohibiting the export of various poisonous gases, was immediately rejected by a vote of 54 to 36. (3) Proposed by Republican Senator Tannheh, advocating prohibiting the export of bombers, was also rejected. (4) Proposed by Republican Senator Davis, advocating that the Senate and the House of Representatives each send four members, and the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of the Treasury, form a neutrality committee to solicit opinions before the President decides to declare that a state of war exists or no longer exists, or to take various measures permitted by the Pittman Bill. This proposal was immediately rejected by the Senate by a show of hands. (5) Proposed by Democratic Senator Towne, advocating that all kinds of armaments, whether in peacetime or wartime, should be prohibited from being transported to other countries, but this does not apply to American countries that are fighting against non-American countries for self-defense. The Senate finally rejected it by a vote of 55 to 27. (6) Proposed by Republican Senator Taft, advocating that the government should provide loan facilities for various goods transported to the warring countries. The Senate immediately rejected it by a vote of 44 to 36. (7) Proposed by Republican Senator Taft, advocating that the value of the currency of each warring country held by the US Exchange Fund should not exceed 20 million US dollars, was also rejected by the Senate by a vote of 47 to 37.</p>
<p>In addition, the Senate also passed a motion stipulating that the time for each senator to speak thereafter should not exceed twenty minutes (originally forty-five minutes).</p>
<h3>Soviet Release of Detained American Vessel - US-Soviet Negotiations Concluded - Germany Claims Contraband Transport</h3>
<p>Moscow (Moeman'ske dispatch) - After maritime authorities here inspected the cargo of the ship "Flint City," they have ordered its release and instructed it to depart from this port immediately. (TASS, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the US government lodged a protest with the Soviet government on the 24th of this month, requesting the return of the American cargo ship "Flint City" and its cargo to the American crew and its release. This request is based on Article 21 of the 1907 Hague Convention. Previously, in 1916, the British ship "Appam," piloted by Germans, arrived in Virginia, USA, and was later ruled by the US Supreme Court to be returned to Britain, serving as a precedent. In addition, the State Department ordered the US Embassy in the Soviet Union to send personnel to the port of Moeman'ske to investigate the situation and submit a report. At the same time, the US Embassy in Germany has also been instructed to conduct all necessary negotiations with the German government. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German official documents state that the detention of the "American vessel Flint City" was legitimate and legal, indicating that Germany intends to regard the ship as a prize of war. It is reported that German Foreign Minister Wetchak has informed the US Ambassador to Germany that the "Flint City" was arrested due to the loss of important certificates and charts. Wetchak also stated that a German expert in handling prize affairs has departed for Moeman'ske, where the ship is detained. The German and Soviet governments are discussing this matter because neither party is certain about the proper procedures. The "Flint City" is not imprisoned, but merely detained in Moeman'ske, it is said. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Pocket Battleship Activity in the Atlantic - British Navy Takes Various Measures - Sunken German Submarine Discovered</h3>
<p>Paris - Well-informed sources here claim that the German pocket battleships "Scheer" and "Deutschland" appear to be active in the Atlantic Ocean. Each vessel has a displacement of 10,000 tons, equipped with six 11-inch caliber guns and eight 6-inch guns. Their range is said to be 10,000 miles. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London - According to various sources, the British ship "Stonegate" and the Norwegian ship "Hansen" were both sunk by the German pocket battleship "Deutschland." The American cargo ship "Flint" was also intercepted by this warship. It was rumored that the "Emden" was responsible, but well-informed sources here do not believe this. On the 8th of this month, a squadron of the British fleet attempted to attack several German warships off the coast of Norway, but failed to approach due to the darkness. The German warships took the opportunity to escape without a trace. At that time, the "Deutschland" also took the opportunity to sail along the Norwegian coast into the Atlantic Ocean. The British Admiralty is said to have taken various measures to capture the vessel when its fuel is exhausted and its return route is cut off. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced that a destroyed German submarine was discovered today near the Goodwin Sands off the southeast coast of England. It is reported that fifty to sixty bodies have been recovered. The Goodwin Sands in the Strait of Dover are a very dangerous area of ​​shallow shoals. During tides, the accumulated sand shifts and changes the form of the shoals with the tide. Many ships have been wrecked on these dangerous sands. The most notable was the loss of thirteen warships in one night. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Germany Claims Soviet Union Announced Support for Long-Term War - Resolved to Supply Germany with Large Quantities of Raw Materials - Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Be Affected</h3>
<p>Berlin - Since the Soviet Union recognized the legitimacy of the Anglo-French blockade against Germany, official sources here declared today that the Soviet Union has decided to supply Germany with large quantities of raw materials to enable Germany to wage a long-term war. At the same time, Germany has decided to supply machinery to the Soviet Union in exchange, to pay for the Soviet raw materials. (AP, 27th)</p>
<p>London - After Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon, it was originally agreed that representatives from the British Board of Trade and the Soviet Trade Delegation in the UK would begin negotiations today. However, the representatives did not meet today. Instead, Ambassador Maisky visited Secretary of Commerce Stanley this morning for a general exchange and decided to postpone the negotiations until the day after tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, it is difficult to say whether the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations will be hampered or postponed after the Soviet Union protested the British Navy's inspection of neutral ships. This is because Ambassador Maisky was not aware that the Soviet government had lodged a protest with the British government when he spoke with Secretary Stanley. According to Soviet sources, this protest only raises a few questions of principle and will not affect trade negotiations. However, it is still unknown whether the British government also holds this view. According to the Soviet people, this protest only raises some principles and will not affect business negotiations. However, it is not yet known whether the British government also holds this view. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the British inspection of neutral ships, after the Soviet government lodged a protest the other day, the British response is expected to be sent out this week. Diplomatic circles here recently commented on this matter, saying that the list of contraband goods previously promulgated by the British government is actually no different from that promulgated by the United States during the last European war. The British government enjoys this right of a belligerent state, acting in accordance with international law, with the aim of cutting off the enemy's overseas supplies. Although the Soviet government lodged a protest, the British current policy will definitely not change as a result. It can be asserted that the Soviet Union also knows that while Britain is waging a long-term war, a protest alone will hardly have any effect. Therefore, the motive for this action is probably to express the solidarity between Germany and the Soviet Union at a very low price. As for the British inspection of neutral ships, since there is ample opportunity for compensation to all neutral countries, it can be seen that the only country that has suffered losses is Germany. The Soviet government cited the 1909 international convention in its note, but in fact, no European country has ratified it. It is difficult to understand why the country cited it. From another perspective, the UK and the Soviet Union are now preparing to conduct trade negotiations based on the barter method. The exchange agreement for rubber and coal concluded by both parties a few weeks ago should be extended to other commodities, and the Soviet protest may not hinder these negotiations. Based on this, since Germany has failed to prevent the Soviet government from interacting with various countries in accordance with its neutral policy, the main intention of the Soviet government's protest yesterday was probably to comfort Germany.

<h3>Military Council Releases Weekly War Situation Report (Continued) October 18th to 24th</h3>
<p>(Shanxi-Henan Front) In southeastern Shanxi, Chinese troops have been attacking Taiguan continuously, successively recovering strongholds such as Sanmatou, Wulongtou, Sigui Village, Sijia Village, Zhuangtou Village, and Maju Village. The remaining Japanese forces are trapped in the city walls and are under siege. In southern Shanxi, 5-600 Japanese troops entrenched southeast of Anze were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army. By the 18th, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated towards Gu County, which was then recovered.

<h3>The Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou: Japanese Troops Tolerate Bandits, Rampant Robbery, Treacherous Merchants Manipulate Currency, Paper Money Greatly Discounted</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: It has been a full year since Guangzhou fell. Although the population has slightly increased compared to the early days of the occupation, this has not led to Guangzhou's prosperity; instead, it has increased the chaos of public order. Half of the residents returning to the city are destitute refugees with nowhere to go, and the other half are emboldened outlaws who have surrendered to the Japanese. The refugees, quickly returning from Hong Kong, Macau, and various villages, have run out of money and have no legitimate jobs upon returning to the city. The recruited outlaws, on the other hand, are acting with borrowed power, running rampant in the city. The Japanese military believes they can use these people as henchmen, using them as spies to control bandits with bandits, and temporarily appease them to reduce the suffering from guerrilla warfare. Little did they know that letting tigers and wolves into the city would lead to more assassination and robbery cases than in quieter times. Previously, the Japanese military guarded against petty theft; now, they are suffering from blatant ambushes on the road and bombs at gatherings. In the past, Japanese sentries outside the city could venture a little over a mile; now, not only are heavy troops stationed in the suburbs, but the inspection posts that had been removed in the city have also been restored, with short trench warfare dug near the posts. Initially, the Japanese military believed that the "using Chinese to control Chinese" strategy was feasible, but now they realize they cannot control the situation. Therefore, Guangzhou's order is currently very chaotic, and most citizens who return to the city stay for only a few days before secretly fleeing again.</p>
<p>So far, there are no legitimate large businesses in Guangzhou's market. Except for Japanese trading companies, most are daily food stores. These food stores are mostly run by shop assistants pooling small capital, or they are shrinking in scale, transforming from shops into stalls. There is no accurate standard for prices, which depend on the state of public order. If the city is suddenly and inexplicably under martial law, and vendors cannot enter or exit the city, food prices immediately rise. Recently, the financial turmoil in the city has been a fatal blow to the market and people's lives. The main cause of the financial turmoil is the discounted paper money, and the cause of the discounted paper money is unconscious. The currency in circulation in Guangzhou is the provincial bank's small denomination notes, which have been in circulation for many years. During this period, through repeated circulation, it is difficult to preserve the paper color or paper quality without slight changes. However, the city discounts paper money, using the excuse that the paper money is old and damaged. If it is old and damaged, it will not be fully accepted, or it will be used at 60% or 50% of its value. Generally, those who hold old paper money suffer intangible losses. It is said that the discrimination against old currency is the work of treacherous merchants in general banks. These people hoard new currency in advance, and when the trend of discounting old currency sweeps the market, they can exchange the new currency, making a profit without limit through manipulation.</p>
<p>Since the trend of discounting paper money occurred, the first to suffer were small food shops. Because they receive old currency, they cannot discount it, but they suffer losses when settling accounts. As a result, many have closed down. The puppet organization is at a loss to deal with this, and the residents who remain in the city feel they are in dire straits.</p>
<p>Traffic between Guangzhou and various villages remains blocked. A few days ago, the Japanese military took advantage of ignorant shipping merchants, promising them temporary small profits to encourage ships to resume navigation on various rivers. Some small ferries from Jiangmen once returned to Guangzhou, restoring the Guangzhou-Shunde and Guangzhou-Jiangdou routes. However, shortly after the voyages, the ferries were repeatedly attacked by guerrillas. In less than a month, they were successively suspended again. Currently, except for one or two ferries operating between Guangzhou and Foshan, and Guangzhou and Panyu, the remaining routes are still cut off. As for the railways, when Guangzhou fell, most of the locomotives on the roads were destroyed by bombing. Since the Japanese army entered Guangzhou, for the convenience of Japanese military transport, they first opened the Guang-San Road (from Guangzhou to Foshan) for military use. Later, they repaired the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to run military trains from Guangzhou to Shitan. Recently, Shitan Station has been repeatedly attacked by Chinese troops, and it is said that train service has been suspended. In short, at present, Guangzhou's land and water transportation can only reach what the Japanese military calls the outer defense line; beyond this, it has been surrounded by Chinese troops.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Launch Three Fierce Attacks on Chaoan, Killing and Wounding Two to Three Hundred Japanese and Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the Chinese troops in Chaozhou and Shantou coordinated with the security forces and guerrillas, they have redeployed their defenses. Every day, a small number of troops are dispatched to counterattack Chaozhou City in rotation, giving the Japanese army no opportunity to rest and adjust. On the 9th and 10th of this month, Chinese troops advanced in two directions towards the Shazhou area outside the South Gate of Chaozhou City. On the evening of the 10th, they launched a surprise attack on Yunbu Market from the south, breaking into the Japanese army's camp and killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, the Japanese army from Shantou rushed to Chaoan to reinforce. At this time, the Japanese strongholds in various places in Fuyang had been besieged by Chinese troops and could not take care of Chaozhou City. On the 13th, the Chinese troops moved north and attacked Bijia Mountain in three directions. At 3:00 PM, they first wiped out a squad of sentries at the foot of the mountain in Tutang, and took advantage of the momentum to attack the mountainside. They held out until 10:00 PM, when Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a large-scale attack on the mountain. The Japanese army hid in earthen caves and refused to come out. The Chinese army then used dry grass soaked in kerosene, tied it to stones, and threw it into the trenches. For a time, the mountain was ablaze with fire. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Japanese army hurriedly destroyed the fortifications on the mountainside and retreated back to Chaoan City. That night, the Chinese army killed fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers. In this battle, the Chinese army charged into the city three times. The first time was by the Security Regiment's Yang Battalion, which entered through the South Gate and engaged in street fighting at the Guanyintang Street intersection. After holding out for forty-five minutes, the South Gate area, which was covered with barbed wire and electrified wires, the Yang Battalion withdrew on its own due to heavy losses. At midnight on the 13th, the Chinese daredevil team attacked the West Gate, set fire to the Japanese barracks in the jungle alley, and used hand grenades to charge for an hour before retreating. At 5:00 AM on the 14th, Chinese troops entered Dongjin Village outside the East Gate. The Japanese military headquarters of Hanshan Normal School immediately opened steel cannons and bombed indiscriminately. Counting the three charges, two to three hundred Japanese and puppet troops were killed or wounded.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Zhenjiang, Demonstrating the Suffering of the People</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since Zhenjiang was occupied by the Japanese army, the livelihood of the people has been extremely depressed. The prices of daily necessities have soared due to the shortage of supplies. Items such as rice, flour, oil, and salt are in short supply. Because Zhenjiang's rice and grain have always relied on Jiangbei and Wuhu, the price of rice from the end of September to the beginning of October once reached over eighteen yuan per picul. After the 10th of this month, new rice entered the market, and the supply increased frequently, so it fell to fifteen or sixteen yuan per picul. Recently, the supply has increased even more, but due to transportation issues, the selling price of high-quality indica rice is still fourteen yuan and two jiao per dan, medium quality thirteen yuan and three jiao, low quality thirteen yuan, high-quality foreign indica rice fourteen yuan, and indica rice ears are between six yuan and two jiao and three jiao. Although these prices are said to have decreased, they are still far more than the nine yuan and five jiao in October last year. Flour has the "Lujinshan" brand under the protection of the Japanese, priced at six yuan and nine jiao per bag, Hongjinshan six yuan and six jiao, and Lanjinshan five yuan and seven jiao. The prices are similar to those in Nanjing. Among the oils, except for soy sauce, which is produced by many soy sauce shops, soybean oil and sesame oil rely on external sources. The net soybean oil is priced at forty-five yuan per dan, with two jin and two liang per yuan, and sesame oil is fifty yuan per dan, with one jin and twelve liang per yuan. Soy sauce varies from twenty yuan to twenty-four yuan. Salt is controlled by the Japanese "Tongyuan Company," which sells salt based on the Huaxing puppet currency, resulting in an invisible increase of more than three yuan per dan. Currently, the legal currency is fifteen yuan, seven jiao and five fen per dan, and retail is one jiao and six fen per jin. Fuel is also expensive, which leads to a surge in firewood prices. Straw is seven jiao per dan, and pine branch firewood is one yuan to one yuan and two jiao per dan. Coal is occasionally in short supply, with Kaiping coal fines costing fifty-six yuan and five jiao per ton, Annam lump coal costing sixteen jin per yuan, and Annam coal fines costing thirty-five jin per yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Approaching Wujiang, Japanese Troops Abandon Strongholds in the Suburbs of Suzhou, Handing Them Over to Puppet Troops to Defend</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese troops occupying this county have abandoned their strongholds in the four suburbs due to their weak strength. Although there are still one or two places that have not been evacuated so far, most of the soldiers have been replaced by the puppet troops of the puppet Pacification Commander Long Guobiao. These puppet troops were formerly bandits in Taihu Lake, and their members are extremely complex. They usually specialize in robbing people of their property in the areas where they are stationed, but when they hear about Chinese troop activities, they panic. Therefore, the Chinese troops ambushing in the four suburbs take the opportunity to attack the Japanese and puppet troops, and are now advancing towards Yanmu in Wujiang, with a tendency to head straight to this county along the Sujia Railway. Therefore, the Japanese troops in this county have recently forced the farmers in Suxiang to rush to build defensive works in Sanliqiao and Yinshan in Wujiang to hold on. Educational News The Guizhou Provincial Department of Education Orders All Schools in the Province and Counties to Relocate to Rural Areas and Implement Compulsory Education (Guiyang Airmail) The province has suffered repeated air raids in recent months. All densely populated counties have been ordered by the provincial government to evacuate. In order to ensure the safety of teachers and students throughout the province, the Department of Education has ordered all public and private schools in the province and counties to relocate to more remote rural towns, such as Qingya, Huaxi, Longli, and Bijie, so that the sound of singing can continue uninterrupted. At the same time, Director Zhang also considered the backwardness of education, with illiteracy accounting for 90% of the province. In order to quickly popularize compulsory education, he specially ordered teachers and students of all schools to implement the "little teacher system" in their respective locations and earnestly implement compulsory education. It is learned that all levels of schools in the province are now complying with the order, implementing compulsory education regardless of Han or Miao people, dividing them into children's classes, adult classes, women's classes, etc. Teachers and students of all schools are willing to work hard on this task, and in their spare time, they write letters on behalf of the families of soldiers on expeditions. As for the curriculum, in addition to teaching general knowledge and air defense common sense, etc., it has only been a month since its implementation, and the effect has been quite significant. Difficult Children's Relief, Education and Training, the Root Cause of Hu Zhenjie and Improvement Measures (6) Qian Yonghe</p>
<p>(II) Clarify Education and Training Objectives The original purpose of difficult children's relief, education and training is to reduce national sacrifice, and the object of enemy enslavement, and to cultivate national seedlings, and cultivate a strong army to build the country. Therefore, the supreme goal of educating and training difficult children is for national liberation and national reconstruction. The most recent and practical goal is the happiness of children's future. However, there are three kinds of facts in the performance of people who are now doing difficult children's education and training. One kind has the concept of cultivating talents for the nation and the country, but lacks the talent and ability rich in educational experience, and the facility of education and training has to focus on relief and charity work. The number of children received is used to show the achievements. Improvement of quality is not easy to take care of. One kind regards the relief of difficult children as a glorious work during the War of Resistance, and also handles the difficult children's education and training business in order to increase their own honor. At the same time, they also rescued a group of unemployed teachers. The third kind of borrowed the name of difficult children's education and training to use Tongtong as a fundraising tool, and to place private individuals and develop forces. Therefore, despite the efforts of all parties to promote the difficult children's education and training business, only a few can get on the right track of education and training. We hope that comrades who are in charge of education and training work will recognize the correct goal of educating and training difficult children. The happiness of children should be the foundation, and national reconstruction and national liberation should be the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>(III) Increase Education and Training Funds When various difficult children's relief groups started to receive difficult children, how much education and training fees should each child need to be considered appropriate? Everyone has no experience. Based on the principle of hard work, perseverance, simplicity and frugality, the Conservation Association first set the food cost for each child at three yuan a month. Everything else comes from donations. Each teacher and staff member is paid ten yuan a month for living expenses, regardless of the complexity of the work or the length of experience. This method is originally a manifestation of the spirit of more obligations and fewer rights, but the result is that children in rural areas only eat three months and one day of food. In cities, various donations include milk, biscuits, candies, clothes, iron beds, etc. Children are the same, and the material enjoyment is very different. Because teachers and staff are volunteers, enthusiastic people come to express their desire to fulfill their obligations, resulting in more workers and fewer responsible persons. Educating and training difficult children has become a situation of forcing seedlings to grow. In addition, as living standards have increased, the standard of living expenses for children has been revised to five yuan per person per month. Teachers and staff salaries are also based on work responsibilities and experience. Recently, children's living expenses and teacher and staff salaries have been set at ten yuan per child per month. The difficult children's education and training funds of other groups mostly refer to the Conservation Association's standards and have also been increased. However, the rapid increase in prices exceeds the administrative improvement. Last September, the Relief Committee drafted a standard of ten yuan per month per child for the regular expenses of education and training institutions, which was originally an improvement standard. In fact, it is now felt that the allocation is insufficient. If there are many children, it can be adjusted. If there are few children, there is no way to contribute. Start-up costs and other special equipment are not included. Therefore, in addition to the fact that children's food and clothing can be barely maintained in each institution, if there are no donations, the educational achievements cannot be demonstrated. Production education is even more out of the question. Therefore, increasing education and training funds is also an urgent issue at present.</p>
<p>(IV) Adjust Education and Training Institutions Difficult children's education and training is a part of the national War of Resistance cause. Staff should understand this and work together to complete this great mission. When the Relief Committee was in Hankou, it discussed with the Conservation Association, the Relief Association, the Ciyou Association, and the Hankou Municipal Refugee Children's Education Committee the principles of dividing education and training. The Conservation Association focused on the conservation of infants and young children, the Relief Association focused on the experiment of production education, the Ciyou Association focused on the education and training of difficult children in the occupied areas, and the Hankou Municipal Refugee Children's Education Committee focused on the promotion of short-term primary schools near the refugee shelters, so that each had a central education work, and the expression of results was also easy to show. But in fact, when children in front of the front line are rescued, everyone regards them as their own flesh and blood. Unless they have to, who would be willing to send out the children they have rescued from hardship? As a result, the large-scale education and training policy is not easy to realize. In order to solve the problem, it is hoped that each group will formulate an overall education and training plan in its own conservation homes, education and training institutions, and Ciyou institutions, designating institution A to focus on infant conservation, institution B to focus on general education, institution C to focus on housekeeping education, institution D to focus on agricultural or craft education, and institution E to focus on special education. Adjust and exchange children with each other to make education and training work develop rapidly. However, the psychology of each institution and each group is just like the psychology of each group. Loving children like one's own is difficult to adjust at once. Therefore, there are children in an institution from three to fourteen years old - actually or already seventeen or eighteen years old, there are children from illiterate to junior high school level, there are children from excellent families, there are children wandering on the streets, there are older boys and girls, and there are all kinds of difficult problems in education and training. Therefore, it is hoped that difficult children's education will have long-term progress, and adjusting education and training institutions is an urgent task.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Unequal, Exchange Rate Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, prices initially softened before firming up. Although HSBC's appetite for purchases was substantial, sellers were predominant, leading to a significant imbalance in positions. Consequently, the trend remained weak. The market opened with the British-American exchange rate further narrowing to 8.75, showing a state of a stable British pound and a tight US dollar. With Sassoon's involvement and arbitrage, the market softened again. The British pound reached a low of four pence 9.0625, and the US dollar was at eight yuan 1.5625. Later, the Japanese and American banks continuously sold, and Hong Kong Telecom frequently released funds, gradually pushing the price up to five pence per shilling, with the US dollar at eight yuan 3.125. However, due to HSBC's strong buying power, even with the Japanese and American banks and Hong Kong Telecom resuming sales, the market remained in a state of fluctuation. By the afternoon close, the British pound was at four pence 9.84375, and the US dollar was at eight yuan 3.125. The afternoon saw a slight shift, with Hong Kong banks offering substantial supply, and some foreign banks still showing interest. However, HSBC's buying appetite was not as strong as in the morning, leading to the British pound breaking through the five-pence mark again, reaching a weak price of five pence 0.3125. The US dollar also firmed up to eight yuan 3.75. At the close of the market, the British pound was still at five pence, and the US dollar was at eight yuan 3.4375, resulting in a weakening of 0.03125 compared to the previous day. Futures trading remained active, with the underlying trend similar to the spot market. Trading was brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>Japanese and American Merchants Unanimously Sell</p>
<p>The day began with London cables showing recent gains of 5.625 and forward gains of 8.75. The New York silver price fell by 1.25 cents. London gold remained stable, and exchange rates for British currency against foreign currencies were generally flat. The US dollar fell by 8.75 against the British pound, by 0.2 yuan against Shanghai currency, and by a small amount against the French franc. Central bank listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened with actual prices for spot transactions, with the British pound at four pence 9.6875 and the US dollar at eight yuan 3.38125, representing a flat British pound and a firm US dollar of 0.03125 compared to the previous close. This was due to the decline in exchange rates. After the opening, due to Sassoon's arbitrage and weak buying interest from foreign banks, conditions tightened and softened. It was estimated that large banks such as Jiantong bought spot British pounds at four pence 9.375, and spot US dollars at eight yuan 2.21875 to 2.15625. Later, the British pound softened the most, with banks once quoting four pence 9.0625. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The announcement of the silver balancing tax revealed a large amount of 3.75 cents. Afterwards, fellow banks suddenly took the opportunity to sell, and Hong Kong Telecom cables also offered sales, immediately shifting the market to a loose and firm state. Fellow banks sold spot British pounds to foreign banks at four pence 9.6875, and spot US dollars at eight yuan 2.25 and 3.125. At the time, Hong Kong Telecom and a certain bank sold spot British pounds to HSBC at five pence, and also sold US dollars for November delivery to fellow banks at eight yuan 1.1875. Subsequently, due to HSBC's strong buying appetite, speculators slightly increased their arbitrage activities. In addition, Chinese banks bought US dollars for this month's delivery, so conditions returned to softening. Jincheng bought US dollars for this month's delivery at eight yuan 2.28125 and 2.25 from Datong and a certain bank. Later, spot prices even weakened again to four pence 9.375 and eight yuan 1.1875. At midday, Hong Kong Telecom and fellow banks resumed selling, so the process returned to firmness. By the midday close, banks' selling prices for spot transactions had firmed up to four pence 9.84375 for the British pound, and the US dollar had eased to eight yuan 3.3125, representing a softening of 0.015625 for the British pound and a strengthening of 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening. It was heard that after the close, due to HSBC's sluggish buying, the British pound rose again to five pence, and the US dollar eased again to eight yuan 3.34375.</p>
<p>British Pound Closes at Five Pence</p>
<p>In the after-market, continued selling pressure from Hong Kong banks and strong buying interest from a certain bank caused conditions to slightly firm up amidst the quiet. The British pound briefly broke through the five-pence mark. It was estimated that Hong Kong Telecom sold spot British pounds to HSBC at five pence 0.15625. At the time, a certain bank also sold spot US dollars to Chinese merchants at eight yuan 3.375. Later, the British pound reached a high of over five pence 0.3125. Afterwards, selling pressure eased, and conditions stabilized slightly. By the evening close, banks' selling prices for spot transactions were five pence for the British pound and eight yuan 3.34375 for the US dollar. This month's prices were the same as spot prices. November's prices were four pence 9.53125 for the British pound and eight yuan 2.25 for the US dollar. As a result, both spot and forward British and American exchange rates weakened by 0.03125 compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Cash Prices Intended to Rise but Fell Instead, Hong Kong Banks Buying Unable to Resist Selling Pressure</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash silver bullion unofficial market saw a difficult recovery, and with foreign exchange rates weakening, buying was less active than selling. Although the market fluctuated throughout the day, it merely followed the fluctuations in the exchange market. At the opening, conditions were firm, due to tight and soft foreign exchange rates and buying from Hong Kong banks. Prices jumped by 30 yuan to 3,810 yuan. After the opening, as foreign exchange rates firmed up, Tianjin banks, silver shops, and certain gold shops sold off, immediately reaching a low of 3,735 yuan. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates stabilized, retail investors took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and Hong Kong banks resumed buying, briefly pushing the price up to 3,780 yuan. By the midday close, as foreign exchange rates firmed up again, gold shops closed at 3,760 yuan. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange rates continued to firm up, money changers sold off. Subsequently, as Hong Kong banks absorbed the selling pressure, the price rose from 3,747 yuan to 3,775 yuan. By the close, the price was 3,770 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading remained brisk, with approximately 2,800 taels traded. Silver jewelry prices initially rose before falling, ultimately remaining unchanged. Customs gold and other precious metals remained flat.</p>
<p>Silver Bullion Falls Slightly by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>From early morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with strong momentum due to news of softening foreign exchange rates and strong buying from client banks, jumping by 30 yuan. Money changers bought ten taels from gold shops at 3,810 yuan. Suddenly, news came of a softening trend in foreign exchange rates, and momentum weakened. Securities firms, silver shops, and certain gold shops began selling aggressively. Although a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop bought over 200 taels on behalf of Hong Kong banks, they could not match the selling pressure, and the price fell by 75 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money changers at 3,735 yuan. Subsequently, foreign exchange rates suddenly softened again, leading to bargain hunting, and Hong Kong banks commissioned a certain gold shop to buy, immediately pushing the price up by 45 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 30 taels from a certain silver shop at 3,780 yuan. At midday, foreign exchange rates suddenly firmed up again, and money changers and gold shops competed to sell. At the same time, Hong Kong banks' buying appetite weakened, and the price fell by 25 yuan. Gold shops and money changers sold a total of 50 taels to a certain gold shop (on behalf of Hong Kong banks) at 3,755 yuan. Later, money changers bought 20 taels from securities firms at 3,760 yuan as the midday closing price. In the early afternoon, as foreign exchange rates continued to firm up, the price fell slightly by 10 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to gold shops at 3,750 yuan. Subsequently, the price recovered by 5 yuan, and another securities firm bought 20 taels from silver shops at 3,755 yuan. Later, money changers sold off, and the price fell again by 8 yuan. Money changers sold 10 taels to securities firms at 3,747 yuan. Afterwards, a certain silver shop suddenly searched for and bought on behalf of client banks, pushing the price up by 28 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 30 taels from gold shops at 3,775 yuan. Later, Hong Kong banks paused buying and adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the price fell by 15 yuan. Money changers traded 50 taels amongst themselves at 3,760 yuan. Subsequently, a certain securities firm bought dozens of taels on behalf of local banks, pushing the price up by 10 yuan. Securities firms bought 27 taels from money changers at 3,770 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell slightly by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of cash gold bars from gold shops was 10 yuan higher, while the buying price was more than 20 yuan lower. The current price of gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and transactions were generally concluded.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Initially Rose Sharply Before Recovering</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry from silver shops was initially quoted at 380 yuan by large firms. The price rose by 5 yuan at 9:30 AM and suddenly fell by 5 yuan at 10:15 AM. Subsequently, there were no changes. As a result, prices remained unchanged, with large firms still quoting 380 yuan. The prices quoted by new firms were the same as the above prices, and the buying price was 15 to 20 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rate Slightly Decreases</p>
<p>Discount Rate Unchanged</p>

<p>American Silver Plummets</p>
<p>British and Indian Silver Rise</p>
<p>London, 26th Dispatch. Speculators bought silver, and supply was limited, stabilizing the market. After the close, the market was extremely stable. Dealers slightly sold off based on the listed price. Buyers were satisfied. Recent deliveries of large bars of silver rose by 5.625, and forward deliveries rose by 8.75. New York silver cables indicated that American spot prices plummeted by 1.25 cents. Bombay silver cables indicated that the Indian silver market was quiet, with spot prices rising by 10 annas and futures prices rising by 9 annas. Only 25 contracts were traded.</p>
<p>Gold Sovereigns Remain Firm</p>
<p>Gold Certificates Continue to Weaken</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw strong demand for British and American gold sovereigns, and the market was firm. However, due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates, demand for British and American gold certificates was sluggish, and the market continued to weaken. Demand for Hong Kong notes was scarce, and the market weakened. Demand for French franc notes remained strong, and the market price slightly increased. Supply of Singapore and Dutch notes increased, and the market weakened. Demand for Annam notes was strong due to travel needs, and the market was quite buoyant. Canadian notes weakened due to the weakening of American gold certificates. Demand for Japanese gold certificates was sluggish, with the evening market at 1 yuan 3.14 cents. Demand for Korean notes gradually decreased, and the market weakened, with the evening market at 1 yuan 0.095 cents. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold sovereigns rise by 1 yuan, British gold certificates fall by 0.3 yuan, American gold certificates fall by 0.14 yuan, Hong Kong notes fall by 0.02 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.001 yuan, Singapore and Dutch notes fall by 0.1 yuan, Annam notes rise by 0.03 yuan, and Italian notes fall by 0.02 yuan.

<h3>Bank Clearing House Further Reduces Exchange Draft Interest Rate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House, having reduced the exchange draft interest rate by 0.02 on the 9th of this month, yesterday sent a circular to all banks, further reducing it by 0.01. The interest rate for public bill call loans and exchange drafts was changed to 0.022, the discount rate for 90-day acceptance bills and exchange drafts was changed to 0.022, and the interest rate for interbank exchange drafts was changed to 0.022. There were no changes to the interest rates for interbank call loans and national currency.</p>
<h3>Securities Foreign Stocks Buy-in Rebounds - Domestic Prices Slightly Decline -</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw a trend towards sideways trading and weakness, with trading further decreasing. Most were watching the market, with the general sentiment slightly bearish. However, the bullish side showed no signs of wavering, but their enthusiasm for adding positions had ceased. In addition, a certain party in the Japanese settlement was holding an important meeting. Although it was known to be a scheme, people were uneasy, causing the market price to struggle to rise. However, a fall of 0.05 to 0.07 would likely trigger resistance from the bullish side to maintain stability. Yesterday's trading was scarce, and the volume of purchases and sales by various firms was small. There were no significant trades that attracted attention. Only the major bullish players had not taken action. The final market prices, except for Ding, were slightly lower by 0.05 to 0.1, while 96 fell by 0.15. The trading volume was only around 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 585.0 584.5 585.0 Down 0.0</p>
<p>Unified B 505.0 504.0 505.0 Down 0.0</p>
<p>Unified C 489.0 486.0 487.0 Down 0.15</p>
<p>Unified D 486.0 484.0 48.0 Flat</p>
<p>Unified Mao 489.0 487.5 488.5 Down 0.05</p>
<p>96 58.0 - 58.0 Down 0.</p>
<p>In the stock market, 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 15 yuan. The Shanghai Public Exchange's stock market opened flat and dull, with prices remaining unchanged. Trading volume was slightly lower. After the afternoon trading began, public interest suddenly increased, and the prices of stocks such as Shanghai Silver Company, China Corporation, Rubber, and Steel stocks attracted significant attention.</p>
<p>Regarding the current London market price for raw rubber, it is approximately 10.75 pence per pound. It is unlikely that this price will rise further and will likely remain stable. Therefore, the market is unlikely to see a selling trend for various rubber products. The growing interest in rubber from various well-known publications is not without reason. During this time of war, statistical information is limited, but it is known that US rubber consumption in August reached 50,500 tons, an increase of 6,600 tons compared to July. At the same time, August inventories decreased by 13,000 tons. However, shipments of rubber bound for the US were slightly higher. As the amount needed for barter agreements is 80,000 tons, the 70% quota will likely remain unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 26th Dispatch. Today's listed prices for British Far Eastern companies' stocks continued to rise. Mercantile Bank shares rose another 2 shillings and 6 pence to 7 pounds 12 shillings and 6 pence. HSBC Bank shares rose by 1 pound each, with shares registered in England at 77 pounds and shares registered in Hong Kong at 78 pounds. Kula-Krimpon Rubber shares recovered by 3 pence to 16 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 26th Dispatch. Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained quiet, with no changes in various bonds at different price levels.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Mills Open, Yarn Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, weakened again due to the easing of exchange rates. In addition, customer demand lacked substantial development capacity. As the mills loosened their stance and sold at high prices, sentiment weakened. Although the source of raw cotton remained constant, prices were unlikely to fall significantly. Therefore, the mills' costs increased, and prices were unlikely to fall significantly. The fundamental problem was weak actual sales, and the goods held by hoarders had not yet been released. For the time being, buying interest was weak. The overall trend may remain sideways, and a new outlook requires the impetus of actual demand.</p>
<p>Spot yarn prices fell as customer banks showed no significant improvement and prices were high. Speculators sold aggressively, leading to a fall of 15 yuan. The spot price for Double Horse yarn at foreign warehouses was 662 yuan, and warehouse receipts were rarely inquired about. The opening price for raw materials rose slightly before rising before softening, and selling pressure suddenly increased, gradually declining to 660 yuan. The trading volume for half a day was 1,340 bales. Prices fell by 15.5 yuan for 20-count Double Horse yarn and 17 yuan for Sky Girl yarn and 15 yuan for Double Globe yarn. Shenxin No. 2 Mill sold 1,000 bales of 20-count Sky Girl yarn at 650 yuan and 200 bales of New Sky Girl yarn at 660 yuan. Today's exports included 1,100 pieces to Haiphong and 80 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various firms are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade 900 Hong Kong 310 Inland 65 North Firms 15 Wenzhou 10 Xiamen 10 Total 1,340</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Mill Transactions Pick Up, Next Month's Fire Machine Cotton Sales Already Underway</h3>
<p>Local cotton transactions showed signs of picking up. Hongzhang and Shenxin No. 2 Mills had some demand, but Japanese mills' buying interest was still limited. Trading was active, and 1,000 bales of Fire Machine cotton for next month's delivery were traded. Therefore, although the yarn market remained weak, the cotton business was still sustainable. Market prices were affected by the yarn market, falling slightly by 1-2 yuan. Sources from Northern Jiangsu included 1,403 bales arriving at Tongzhou cotton and 1,460 bales from North Sha.

<p>In other news, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were sluggish due to the unpredictable foreign exchange rates. Mills had no buying interest, and traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Japanese mills have had no trade recently, and several days have passed since the last transaction. The general opinion is that the current cotton prices are unlikely to improve.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market saw that New York cotton prices strengthened in the early morning due to buying pressure. Traders believed that the Neutrality Act would undoubtedly pass, so buyers were enthusiastic. Later, cotton prices weakened due to selling from short sellers and profit-taking by long sellers. Closing prices fell by 3-4 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton rose by 1 rupee, Egyptian cotton rose by 20 pounds, and Liverpool cotton rose by 7 pence.</p>
<h3>Grains Japanese Merchants Hoard Rice - New Early Rice Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various firms received only 2,000-3,000 bags of rice from Baotou via wagons, so sentiment was firm again. Most rice merchants held their positions and were unwilling to sell easily. Local merchants also had a positive outlook and were actively purchasing. Therefore, the market was tight in the morning, and prices rose. However, as the market rose, boat and rice merchants sold at high prices, causing the market to weaken again. As a result, the market showed a mixed picture of rising and falling prices. New early rice and customer-grade rice rose by 0.35 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged.

The total trading volume for the city was approximately 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>In other news, due to poor harvests in customer Jiangbei rice declined to on the basis of a loss. Although there were 60,000 to 70,000 bags of rice in storage in Jiangbei, the cost was above 20 yuan. Therefore, rice remained in storage, and new shipments were largely halted. Although Japanese merchants had piles of in Wuhu and this city, they were unwilling to sell in large quantities on the market. Yesterday, only a small amount was traded, and the market continued to increase by 0.2-0.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Banks Trade in Bulk, Flour Mills Restrict Supply, Wheat Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Flour transactions continued to be quiet. Although both North and South customer firms intended to purchase, flour mills restricted supply and refused to trade with large firms. The circulation of floating warehouse receipts on the market gradually decreased, and the market gradually became quiet. In addition to local daily needs and scattered transactions, customer sales were minimal. No. 2 flour mill's price remained at 7.3 yuan, supplying only local retail sales. The price for passenger cars and Green Soldier boats was 7.4 to 7.5 yuan, and the market was still in the process of developing. Today, 6,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The source of wheat remained scarce. Since the sharp rise the previous day, sellers have been more resistant to lowering prices, and mills have been hesitant to purchase. Traders have also been watching the market due to high prices. As a result, the market still rose slightly. The highest price has reached 11.1 yuan. Today, 770 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Foreign Sugar Weakens</h3>
<p>The sugar market saw a slight stabilization due to rumors of increased taxes on domestic sugar.

<h3>Love is Healthy Vitality</h3>
<p>A weak man is certainly a sinner in love!</p>
<p>Rather than saying "Love is [missing text] work", it is better to say "Love is healthy vitality." Because there are many men who, although they sit and eat all day, doing nothing, constantly mingling with their wives, if some part of his body shows weakness and incompetence, and he cannot coordinate with his wife and obtain joy in love life, his love will secretly escape! Once love between husband and wife is lost, family life is like ice and charcoal being incompatible, so anger and quarrels arise, or even lead to tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and suicide! Conversely, if the man is healthy and the woman is beautiful, even if the husband is driven by the whip of life, busy and toiling all day long; or goes on a long journey, separated from his wife, their love will never diminish due to being busy or separated. They will surely cherish each other in their hearts from afar. Whenever there is an opportunity, they will seek a way to reunite. At that time, the [missing text] sweetness will be as fast as enjoying being an immortal. Even if the seas run dry and the stones crumble, this love will not change, giving birth to clever children, and organizing a happy family. How glorious and happy is life!</p>
<p>The ironclad proof shows that love is undoubtedly a healthy vitality. So why do men lose their health, thus falling into a tragic situation in life? According to medical opinions, it is mostly because men committed self [missing text] seminal emission in their early years, or early marriage and indulgence, which exhausted their reproductive gland fluid. Thus, all kinds of symptoms such as neurasthenia, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging are not uncommon. Such sick men not only have difficulty in achieving conjugal bliss with their wives, becoming sinners in love, but may even affect reproduction, resulting in infertility and childlessness. Even if they have children, they will also be weak and sickly! In addition, because of exhaustion, they often give up on academic pursuits and find it difficult to be competent in their careers, or even die from illness, dying young. How dangerous is this!</p>
<p>Today, the above-mentioned symptoms are no longer incurable. If treated with the right and effective medicine, it can certainly be cured in a matter of days. What is the effective medicine? It is the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin." Because this preparation is made by extracting the reproductive gland extracts from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, sea dogs, bears, deer, etc., and refining it using a concentration and reproduction method, its quality is precious, its nature is peaceful, and its nourishing power is active and thorough, exceeding any similar preparation. Therefore, after taking it, it can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night. Regular use can also promote development and regulate metabolism. It can certainly cure various symptoms radically in a short period of time, making the body even healthier. Therefore, world-renowned doctors recommend this preparation as the only sacred medicine specifically for nourishing weak men. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to stop the leakage, so that treating the symptoms and addressing the root cause are implemented at the same time, and the effect will be even more rapid. Based on my experience of more than ten years, I have used this preparation (available at Wing On Pharmacy and Wuzhou Chinese and Western Pharmacy) to cure no less than tens of thousands of patients.</p>
<h3>Symptomatic Treatment of Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>Specialist in Venereal Diseases, Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>The right medicine is like opening a lock. This is indeed true. Therefore, the German medical sage Dr. Schmidt once said: "There is no incurable disease in the world, but it is difficult to find the right medicine." The prosperity of German medicine is probably due in no small part to the doctor's efforts. Dr. Schmidt also used his decades of experience to secretly manufacture a kind of "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills", specializing in the treatment of seminal emission, spermatorrhea, sperm leakage and other symptoms. The effect is indeed effective. It has been sold all over the world and has been praised by everyone. It is praised by Chinese and foreign doctors as the most symptomatic sacred medicine for treating seminal emission! Considering why young people suffer from seminal emission: most of them must be due to self-inflicted indulgence, or overwork and injuries, which have damaged the sexual nerves, resulting in the relaxation of the seminal valve. A drop that is not stopped will burst into rivers and seas. Although seminal emission is very slight at the beginning, it must be treated quickly to prevent future troubles. There are many cases where people who delay treatment and do not receive treatment change from mild nocturnal emission to dreamless spermatorrhea and daytime sperm leakage. There are even more cases where seminal emission over time leads to sperm exhaustion and blood depletion, resulting in brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging. Most of these young people are listless and depressed. Failure in study, unemployment, and love failure are inevitable results; even for those who are married, the life of the couple must not be satisfactory, and all kinds of tragedies in the family will arise. Life at this point, how much pain! If you want to seek remedy, you must never seek medical treatment or take medicine indiscriminately, so as not to fall into a desperate situation! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, it is still necessary to take the sacred medicine for treating seminal emission "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to consolidate the seminal valve and stop leakage. In addition, it is also necessary to take the world's only brain and kidney tonic, the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, promote development, and regulate metabolism. Continued use will certainly cure various symptoms in a short period of time and make you healthier.</p>
<p>Patient Li Zhigao, a native of Guangdong, was five years old. Because of seminal emission that was not treated, he rashly married. After marriage, he was unable to perform sexually, and was hated by his wife. Moreover, because of brain weakness and insomnia, he recently became unemployed. He came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment last month. After a detailed examination of his condition, he was instructed to purchase "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" and "Reproductin" at Huamei Pharmacy for simultaneous use. He was also given electrotherapy injections. After only one month, he has now recovered. The couple's love life is happy and he has also obtained a new job at a certain company.</p>

<h3>How Important is the Development of the Breasts! American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</h3>
<p>No matter where you are, women always have an advantage over men. Beautiful and healthy women have even more advantages over mediocre and ugly women. This is an ironclad fact. Therefore, all women want to be healthy and beautiful, fragrant and sweet everywhere, and be welcomed by everyone. She is like a peony among the flowers, appearing elegant, graceful and incomparably beautiful.</p>
<p>But is fulfilling the heart's desire not a hidden regret since ancient times! Some of them are weak and frail due to malnutrition since childhood, so even after the period of spring love, they are still weak and frail, with no plump curves at all, and there is no way to talk about health and beauty. Some have a pretty face, but unfortunately, she has constricted her chest since childhood, failed to recuperate after illness, suffered from leucorrhea, irregular menstruation, excessive lust, postpartum deficiency, etc., which caused damage to the function of the reproductive gland ovaries, affecting metabolism. Therefore, the body cannot produce a large number of new cells. Naturally, the muscles are thin and the complexion is sallow. The breasts do not have good development, and the buttocks must also be thin and lack plumpness. Therefore, the characteristic beauty of women is completely lost. How can she compete in the arena of love and obtain her ideal husband. Not only that, but such women mostly suffer from decreased sexual desire and uterine coldness due to the withered breasts and lack of reproductive gland ovary secretion. Therefore, childbirth is difficult, and even she will not get pregnant throughout her life. Even if there are millions of family assets, she will have to hand them over to others. Considering this, the relationship between the breasts and the overall health and happiness of women is too great! But this kind of defect is not difficult to remedy in today's era of scientific prosperity and medical advancement. According to the clinical experimental results of well-known Chinese and Western gynecologists. The most recommended and effective medicine is the female "Reproductin", a reproductive gland ovary preparation. The ingredients used in this preparation are purely ovarian hormones, pituitary glands, liver [missing text], [missing text] organs, and minerals such as phosphorus and calcium from healthy animals, which are precisely refined under purple light. Therefore, the efficacy is accurate and the medicinal power is great, far beyond the reach of ordinary medicines. If you continue to take six boxes in a row, the withered breasts can be raised, the buttocks can be plumped, menstruation can be normalized, the complexion can be rosy, love between husband and wife can be increased, and unparalleled health and beauty and happiness can be obtained.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Building Roads Beyond Boundaries: The Bureau of Works' Plan is Sent Out; Delivered to the Puppet Mayor the Night Before Yesterday; Fan Keling had Second Talks with Fu [missing text]; The Two Sides' Opinions are Incompatible, Making it Unlikely</h3>
<p>Negotiations on building roads beyond boundaries, with the leadership consul Colonel Naroni of the leading group mediating from the side, the Director-General of the Bureau of Works Fan Keling visited Fu [missing text] on the evening of the 23rd, breaking the deadlock. The Director-General and President of the Bureau of Works, Fei Maolipu, and the Chief of the Police Department of the Bureau, Bao En, discussed several "Proposed Guidelines" to serve as a basic plan to resolve the dispute between the Bureau of Works and the puppet "Municipal Government". According to the reporter of Dazhong News Agency, the plan has been drafted and was delivered to Fu Xiaoan by the Director-General Keling of the Bureau of Works on the evening of [missing text] (26th). It is heard that Fu held a banquet at his official residence in the "City Center Area" to entertain [missing text], but the results of the second meeting are kept secret by both sides. It is heard that Fu Xiaoan only expressed a reserved attitude towards the plan. The reporter of Dazhong News Agency also learned from an authoritative source in diplomatic circles that the principle of the Bureau of Works for solving the issue of building roads beyond boundaries in the Western District is to focus on joint management. Representatives from the Bureau of Works and the puppet municipal government will form a special management agency together. It is also believed that this is a considerable concession proposal, but on the side of the puppet municipal government, Fu Xiaoan proposed two prerequisites when he first met with Fan Keling on the evening of the 23rd: insisting on the "full takeover" of building roads beyond boundaries in the Western District and requesting the Bureau of Works to completely transfer the taxation rights, police rights, and all other administrative rights of building roads beyond boundaries to the jurisdiction of the puppet municipal government. The opinions of the two sides are like [missing text] and are difficult to reconcile, so the future is unlikely to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Intercepting Vegetable Boats Settled through Mediation</h3>
<p>Vegetable boats carrying local goods usually go to the local goods shops in the area of the Old Gate Bridge Wharf to unload goods.

This dispute was resolved yesterday in the Port Director's office through the mediation of Sugiyama, the Japanese Acting Port Director of the Jianghai Customs. According to the reporter of Dazhong News Agency, the solution is that 40% of the vegetable boats coming to Shanghai in the future will unload goods at Touba, and 60% will unload goods at the Old Gate Bridge.</p>

<h3>Subsidy Issue Resolved: Postmen Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon; Subsidies Increased by Ten Yuan Across the Board Starting from September; Request for Fifteen Yuan Will be Reported to the General Bureau by Telegram; Backlogged Mail Delivered in Full That Evening</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 postmen and coolies from the Shanghai Postal Administration, its branches, and inland bureaus announced a temporary cessation of work and implemented a work slowdown from 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday due to the unfair subsidy treatment from the bureau. All mail delivery in the area completely stopped. The Postal Workers' Union convened a meeting of representatives from various branches the evening before to discuss countermeasures, and notified all members to strictly abide by order and wait for a solution. At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, representatives Cheng Zuoqing, Ye Fusheng, Sun Zhudong, Wang Kai, Shen Wenxun, and Sun Hanliang were sent to meet with Director-General Zapeilin to request approval for additional subsidies. After consultation, Zapeilin agreed to increase the subsidies for all postal workers: (1) Starting from September, the subsidies for all postmen and coolies will be increased by two and a half yuan across the board, totaling ten yuan, and will be supplemented when salaries are paid in November.

<h3>Chinese Guerrillas Successfully Destroyed Rail Tracks; 500 Meters of Rail Tracks Destroyed at Wangting; Passenger Trains to and from Shanghai and Nanjing are All Delayed</h3>
<p>Late the night before yesterday (26th), a section of rail tracks west of Wangting Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, stretching for more than 500 meters to Zhoujing Lane, was destroyed by Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, the early train from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning failed to arrive in Shanghai, and the early passenger train from Shanghai to Nanjing did not depart until 10:00 a.m. and ended at Suzhou Station. Yesterday morning, more than 100 Japanese soldiers rode to the scene of the accident to stand guard, but the Chinese guerrillas had already retreated. Another Japanese train, which was being transferred to Nanjing, also got off the train and walked to Zhoujing Lane before transferring to Beijing when it arrived at Wangting due to the destroyed tracks. It is heard that the destroyed rail tracks were not repaired until around 3:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Mines Outside of Aojiang Repeatedly Exploded; Japanese Planes Flew to Lishui Wenxi and Dropped Five Bombs, Killing Only One Person</h3>
<p>According to definite news in the shipping industry, the Japanese have been laying a large number of mines outside the mouth of the Aojiang River since they declared military action against Aotou. Those laid near Lingkun outside the mouth of Wenzhou are densely packed, so explosions occur from time to time. There was a tragic incident a few days ago in which seventeen fishing boats were struck by mines and exploded. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Wenzhou salt boat smuggled salt from Xiashan for import, but accidentally triggered a mine and exploded. The boat was shattered and more than a dozen boatmen were torn to pieces. The situation was extremely tragic. The Japanese are now sending warships to repair the opposing lock line. Since the Japanese warships in the eastern coastal area of Zhejiang unsuccessfully shelled Xiangshan Port on the 21st, they still show signs of making trouble. Two Japanese warships anchored off Ligang in the waters outside Zhenhai Port. One of them has escaped yesterday morning, and the other is still anchored in its original location without any changes. In addition, a Japanese aircraft carrier anchored off Leqing dispatched a water bomber to Lishui Wenxi on the afternoon of the 16th, dropping five bombs, killing one person and destroying more than seventy houses, with no other losses.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Guerrillas Attacked Silk Cocoon Trucks; Two Trucks Escaped, Two Were Intercepted; Escorting Japanese Soldiers Killed Two</h3>
<p>The Japanese side has established a "Central China Silk Company" for the silk industry in the Southeast region. All silk cocoon business in the occupied areas is controlled by the company. On the 7th of this month, the Wuxi branch of the company used four trucks to transport cocoons purchased in Heqiao Town, west of Wuxi, back to Wuxi. On the way, they were attacked by Chinese guerrillas near Huacang Mountain. At that time, it was around 1:00 p.m. When the first truck drove to the eastern end of Huacang Mountain, 200 Chinese guerrillas had gathered there and fired at the truck. The truck driver and police officer increased their speed and drove out in the rain of bullets. Later, the second and third trucks came one after another, and the sound of grenades from the roadside was as dense as a string of beads. Although the second truck still drove away at risk, the third truck thought that the car in front had been blown up, so it stopped suddenly, and the fourth truck also continued to stop because the road was blocked.</p>
<p>More than ten Japanese accompanying guards jumped out of the car and hid in the bushes. At the same time, the Chinese guerrillas' attack intensified. Although the Japanese also fought back, the disparity between the two sides was too great. The Japanese escorting soldiers Ishikawa Teruji and Tokuda Masao, who had served as sergeant and private first class in the Japanese artillery, fought back with pistols on the roadside. Tokuda's buttocks, head, and chest were all hit by machine gun bullets and he died on the spot. Ishikawa also died soon after being hit in the chest.</p>
<p>Only the remaining people escaped.</p>
<p>All 15 bags of cocoons and several pistols and rifles abandoned by the Japanese were taken away by the guerrillas. When the Japanese army heard the news and rushed to the scene, the guerrillas had already returned to their original location.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Works Changed the Exchange Rate for Retirement Savings to Consider the Interests of All Parties and Reduce Unexpected Expenses</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Works changed the guaranteed exchange rate for the retirement savings of foreign employees due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange. It issued a special notice yesterday, saying: The guaranteed exchange rate for the retirement savings of foreign employees of the Bureau, except for those who were already eligible for exchange rate subsidies in accordance with the terms of service before July 1937, is now guaranteed by the Bureau at the exchange rate when the payment is made, which is one national currency equivalent to one light gold of British gold, or 100 national currency equivalent to 86 Japanese gold, or 24.85 US dollars. This guarantee method has been implemented since June 1, 1938. At that time, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate, it was considered that the losses should be borne jointly by the Bureau and the employees. The Bureau is willing to maintain this principle. However, because the exchange rate has fallen further recently, the Bureau's burden has become heavier, and it deeply feels that this situation cannot be allowed to remain unchanged for a long time. Therefore, the Bureau has been forced to change the guaranteed exchange rate for retirement savings deposited on or after May 1, 1940, to one national currency equivalent to eight pence of British gold, or 100 national currency equivalent to 57.33 Japanese gold, or 16.42 US dollars. If the exchange rate does not improve in the future, this change will indeed cause the foreign employees of the Bureau to sacrifice quite a bit when receiving their retirement savings. However, if the guaranteed exchange rate is not revised and the Bureau is allowed to continue to bear the considerable unexpected expenses, it will not be a good strategy for the interests of all parties.</p>
<h3>Beans Going to the Philippines Must Have a Certificate</h3>
<p>Beans and bean cakes transported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to the Philippines must now have a certificate in order to be imported. The following is the notice issued by the Philippine Overseas Chinese Aid Resistance Committee on the 9th of this month: For notice matters, this committee previously received a letter from the Overseas Chinese Import and Export Chamber of Commerce inquiring about domestic products exported to the Philippines, such as melon seeds, soybeans, mung beans, black beans, red beans, white sesame, peanuts, small bean cakes, wood ears, golden needles, garlic, shallots, potatoes, ham, walnuts, chestnuts, etc. Although these sixteen items are not from the four northeastern provinces and have not been explicitly banned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, the places of origin of these goods have all been occupied, so we are also in the prohibited list. The 12th meeting of the Resistance Department of this Committee discussed this and decided that in addition to beans and bean cakes, all beans and bean cakes produced in the four northeastern provinces will not be allowed to be imported from the date of the notice. Those exported from Shanghai and Hong Kong must obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Industry Association and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce proving that the goods are not subject to control before they can be imported. At the same time, the number of items received, the type of labels, and bean samples must be submitted to the committee for verification. The committee is currently studying other items and will report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions, and will inform you again. Accordingly, it is recorded and all overseas Chinese merchants are informed. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3>The President's Round-Trip Ship Also Goes to Shanghai; Temporary Changes After the European War; The Kreifeld Will Arrive in Port Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' ships, from August 3 to March 14 next year, follow the new route, which is from the United States via Japan to Shanghai, to Hong Kong and then to Xiaoluzong. From Xiaoluzong on the return trip to Hong Kong, it will go straight to Japan and back to the United States and will not come to Shanghai. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the goods transported from Shanghai to the United States have been more prosperous than before. In order to adapt to the current situation, the company has temporarily changed the new route, that is, the ships that are currently scheduled to depart from the United States and come to Shanghai will be changed to come to Shanghai when returning from Xiaoluzong in order to load more goods for transportation to the United States. This will be implemented starting from the next train's Tiger Tall President. The Kreifeld President, temporarily ordered to come to Shanghai as well, was originally scheduled to arrive in port yesterday, but it is now heard that it has been delayed by one day and will arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. today. The big wheel is scheduled to leave for Japan and return to the United States from 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, the 29th. The last connecting small wheel will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Yesterday was US Navy Day - All ceremonies cancelled, only the Marines drilled at the Race Course - Flagship crew each given a day off</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that, although today (the 27th) is US Navy Day, the US authorities have not prepared various receptions and other activities as in previous years. The US Asiatic Fleet's flagship, the USS Augusta, which in the past would host visits from the American community in Shanghai on this holiday, did not hold this reception today. However, this afternoon, the US Marines and Navy sailors drilled at the Race Course, reviewed by Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol. The crew of the Augusta were given a day off. The Royal Air Force Association held a banquet at its headquarters in the HSBC Building, entertaining Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, his Chief of Staff Colonel Carroll, and other staff officers.</p>

<h3>Mitsui Company Publicly Seizing Eggs in Shanghai - Over Five Thousand Baskets Seized One After Another - All Broken, Canned, and Sold to Britain - British Ambassador to Protest to Tokyo</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that foreign egg-canning factories in Shanghai, including two American and five British companies, are having the eggs they purchased in the interior seized by the Japanese company Mitsui. Mitsui's shamelessness reached its peak when they seized an entire cart of eggs, totaling 122 baskets, on Broadway Road. Between October 10th and 24th, no fewer than 5,215 baskets of eggs, each containing 800 eggs, were seized and taken to Mitsui's factory on Huangpu Road. Mitsui then broke the eggs, canned them, and sold them in large quantities to Britain. This kind of</p>
<p>Seizure Operation</p>
<p>has been reported to the British and American embassies, and it is expected that they will protest to the Tokyo government accordingly. At the same time, the supply of eggs to these British and American factories is dwindling, and their output is very small. It has been investigated that Mitsui Company's egg refrigeration and canning factory on Huangpu Road originally belonged to Maochang Company, which was forced to withdraw. Now the factory is nominally the Yangtze Egg Company, but it is actually owned and operated by Mitsui Company. The method used by various companies to purchase eggs is to send people to the egg-producing areas at the mouth of the Yangtze River to purchase them with cash and transport them to the</p>
<p>Yangtze River Port.</p>
<p>Currently, almost only Japanese ships are allowed to carry goods. The freight is calculated at the port of loading and paid upon arrival in Shanghai. Some eggs are transported by the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway, but when they are transferred to Japanese ships for transport to Shanghai, the goods are refused to be delivered. When representatives from various companies go to pick up the eggs, they are told that they have received orders not to deliver the eggs to the legitimate consignees, but to Mitsui Company. Recently, a certain British company purchased eggs and had them transported to Shanghai by a certain shipping company. The shipping company directly delivered the eggs to</p>
<p>Mitsui Company</p>
<p>and even had the audacity to present the freight bill to the legitimate consignee for payment, which was of course refused. Before the European War, nine out of ten of the egg products exported from Shanghai went to Britain. It is generally believed that this figure has now increased. Mitsui Company is indeed seizing eggs belonging to American and British companies, canning them, and shipping them directly to Britain. The cart of eggs seized by Mitsui Company employees on Broadway Road belonged to a British egg-packing</p>
<p>refrigeration company</p>
<p>in Yangshupu. These eggs had just arrived at the McGonagil Road station and were being transported by a cart of 122 baskets to Yangshupu. The seizure took place on Broadway Road, which is within the International Settlement. This seems to have made Mitsui Company personnel somewhat uneasy, and they immediately sent a letter to the British company, saying that if the company would provide a letter stating "it is understood that the Mitsui Company made a temporary mistake," they would be willing to return the eggs. However, the British company has refused to issue such a letter. The current situation is as described, with no further developments.</p>
<h3>The Pseudo-Finance Bureau Plans to Impose Heavy Taxes - Business Tax of 1.5% - And Arbitrarily Assesses Capital</h3>
<p>It has been learned from relevant sources that the pseudo-"Finance Bureau", following the orders of the pseudo-"Municipal Government", prepared in the spring of this year to levy a "business tax" on various industries, stipulating a rate of 0.3% based on capital. However, due to opposition from residents in various districts, it was suspended until now, and the tax was not levied. Now, the bureau, finding that the pseudo-"Municipal Government" is running out of funds, has decisively decided to implement the tax levy. In the past week, it has dispatched pseudo-officials to various industries and businesses to investigate capital and turnover. However, it is not collecting taxes according to the prescribed tax rate, but forcibly charging merchants a heavy tax of 1.5%. At the same time, it is arbitrarily assessing capital and randomly specifying the amount of tax to be paid. Merchants who dare to object are subject to detention. It is said that merchants in various districts have decided to resist unanimously and refuse to pay the tax.</p>
<h3>Secretary of the International Red Cross, Baker, to Travel to the United States</h3>

<h3>Two Chinese Sailors on German Ships Died En Route to Kobe</h3>
<p>The German company Hamburg Lines' ships "Oldenburg" and "Meissen", left Shanghai before the outbreak of the European War, heading to the United States via Japan. Unexpectedly, when the ships arrived in Yokohama, the war broke out, so they stayed in Yokohama harbor. The seventy-five Chinese sailors among them also stayed in Japan. Recently, when the Dollar Line's President Pierce sailed from the US via Japan to Shanghai, the Chinese sailors boarded the President Pierce to Shanghai. The ship arrived here on the morning of the 25th. Among them were two sailors from the Oldenburg, who unfortunately died while the ship was en route to Kobe. The passengers on the President Pierce, sympathizing with the plight of the two Chinese sailors, generously donated money to cover the cost of burial for the deceased's families.</p>
<h3>Factory Registration in This City - Can Temporarily Report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed that the factory registration in Shanghai can temporarily be filled out by the factories in accordance with the prescribed form and submitted to the Ministry for record.

<h3>Workers' Demands at the American-Asian Silk Factory - Hopeful of a Satisfactory Resolution</h3>
<p>More than 500 workers at the No. 4 factory of the American-Asian Silk Weaving Factory on Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai, due to the recent rise in prices and the difficulty of living, unanimously demanded improved treatment from the factory on the 26th, and once went on strike. At that time, the labor side elected ten representatives to negotiate directly with the factory's deputy manager, Mr. Tong Xinbo, and put forward four demands: (1) Restore pre-war wages; (2) Restore room and board; (3) Restore the warp and weft subsidies; (4) Issue a living allowance of six yuan per month. It is reported that the negotiation went very well. The factory agreed to restore pre-war wages from November, restore the warp and weft subsidies, increase the subsidy by three cents per day, and adjust wages and increase them appropriately from January 1 next year. The labor side expressed deep gratitude for the factory's sincere attitude. However, the two major issues of room and board and living allowances have not been agreed on, and negotiations are continuing. It is expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Operators Decide to Announce Publicly - Passengers Will Increase Fares Appropriately</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Association of the Special District, due to the soaring prices of hardware materials, although it has requested the Municipal Council to increase fares, has been repeatedly rejected. However, other public utilities, such as tap water, tap fire (gas), electricity, buses, trams, taxis, etc., as well as social businesses, have all increased prices unanimously. The Municipal Council alone refuses to allow this industry to increase fares. Therefore, a representative meeting of the five districts was convened yesterday afternoon, with more than one hundred people attending. Mr. Yin Zhiling presided over the meeting, reporting on the circumstances of requesting a fare increase and the current market price of materials, which has increased by at least three to four times. The original fare is really impossible to maintain. It was decided to announce to passengers in all circles that fares will be increased appropriately to maintain the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers and to facilitate fare increases.</p>
<h3>German Consul Langtao Departs Shanghai to Return to His Country - Transferred to Work in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>

He has recently been transferred to work in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and left Shanghai this morning (the 27th), returning to Berlin via Siberia.</p>
<h3>The Pseudo-"Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" - Dissolved by the Japanese Side - Due to Complex Elements and Hollow Organization - Japanese Attempts to Manipulate the Labor Movement Apparently Failed</h3>
<p>In order to attempt to manipulate the Shanghai labor movement, hoping to broadly plant people's power for its own use, the Japanese and puppet side, in October of last year, launched the so-called "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" by the pseudo-"Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs," Hu Shouchang, claiming to act in place of the city's Federation of Trade Unions. Because after more than a year of establishment, all legitimate trade unions still refused to cooperate, resulting in a hollow internal organization with no real power, it has been ordered by the Japanese side to dissolve a few days ago. The following are the details investigated by the Daguang News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Complex Elements and Hollow Organization</p>
<p>The pseudo-"Chinese Workers' Welfare Association," instigated by the Japanese side, was launched by the pseudo-"Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs," Hu Shouchang, and was declared established in October of last year. The association headquarters was located on the second floor of the Nisshin Company on the Bund. Hu himself served as the "President," and a Japanese man named Kuba was promoted to advisor. Lin Zihong was the "Secretary-General," and the association called for the relief of unemployment and the alleviation of the suffering of workers, attempting to win over various trade unions in the city to join in cooperation. However, the responsible persons of each trade union were well aware of justice and firmly refused to participate. The association then absorbed some degenerates and ruffians, fabricated the names of trade unions, and fabricated membership lists, practicing self-praise and self-singing in order to swindle subsidies from the Japanese side. In fact, due to complex elements, frequent power struggles, and repeated disputes, the internal organization was extremely hollow. Although it has been established for more than a year, it has no power to speak of.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Dissatisfied, Ordered Dissolution</p>
<p>The pseudo-organization was originally given a huge subsidy by the Japanese side on a monthly basis, in an attempt to cultivate people's power for its own use. However, because the trade unions of all legitimate organizations in the city refused to participate, resulting in a hollow internal organization with no achievements, the Japanese side expressed deep dissatisfaction with this. In January of this year, the subsidy was once suspended. Then, Lin Zihong went around lobbying to reorganize and plan to resume activities. But the result was still ineffective. Recently, the Japanese side discovered that the various trade unions affiliated with the "Welfare Association" had no real workers, and that the so-called representatives of various industries were mostly not members of those industries. As a result, the Japanese side became even more dissatisfied and ordered the dissolution of the pseudo-organization a few days ago, stopping its activities. Lin and other boring elements have also scattered, feeling very uninteresting.</p>
<h3>The German Large Motor Ship Will Moor in the Huangpu River for a Long Time - Empty Ship with a Swastika Flag - Temporarily Unable to Return to the Country Due to the Outbreak of the European War</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that since the outbreak of the European War, the German motor ship "Ramses", moored in Wusong, sailed up the Huangpu River at 2 pm yesterday (the 26th) to the naval area of ​​the Huangpu River, next to buoys 11 and 11, which are 600 feet long, so that the ship could be safely moored in the area during the war and not move elsewhere. The ship's stern was hung with a swastika flag, and both sides were also painted with</p>
<p>Swastika symbols.</p>
<p>The ship was empty. Its masts and chimneys were painted yellow. If it weren't for the swastika flag, people would recognize it as a Swedish ship. The ship was slowly driven forward by two tugboats yesterday. When it passed the American ship Augusta and the American ship Isabel, it raised the flag at the stern of the ship to pay tribute, but when it passed the British and French warships in the Huangpu River, it did not pay tribute. According to reports, the Ramses left Shanghai for Europe on August 31. Because at that time</p>
<p>The overall situation was critical,</p>
<p>it sailed to Wusong and stopped. After the declaration of war on October 3, the ship could not sail out and moored at Wusong. Last week, it sailed into the Manchurian Railway Wharf in the Huangpu River to unload goods, and yesterday it sailed upstream to moor near the Dalai Wharf. The Ramses belongs to the Henme Company and weighs more than 7,983 tons. Its mooring fee in Wusong is more than 30 taels per day, and mooring at the upstream buoy is 15 taels per day.</p>
<h3>Finance Department Forbids Transportation of Cigarettes from Shanghai and Guerrilla Areas - Original Telegram</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance prohibited the transportation of cigarettes from Shanghai and guerrilla areas, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry to request a change. The following is the original telegram from the Ministry of Finance ordering customs houses to prohibit transportation: It is understood that the transportation of cigarettes on which the consolidated tax has been paid to the interior, previously approved by the Ministry, refers specifically to cigarettes made in the Hong Kong factories of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Ewo Tobacco Company. Cigarettes made in Shanghai or other guerrilla areas with prohibited imported goods as raw materials should be prohibited from transportation in the same way as prohibited imported goods. Please comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Water Patrol Team Divides Areas to Seize - Police Authority on the Bund of the Concession - South Huangpu and the West Section of the Suzhou River - Under Japanese Control and Rejection</h3>
<p>The pseudo-"Dadao Police" "Water Patrol Team", in order to seize the police authority of the Huangpu River on the wharves of the concession, has now divided the eastern section of the Suzhou River into two districts, and the area from Wusongkou to the blockade line has been divided into two districts, placing a total of four detachments. Preparations have already begun. It is found that after the war, the water police authority from Shiliupu to Yangshupu and from the Baidu Bridge on the Suzhou River to the Xizang Road Bridge was handled by the Customs Water Police Department. Even all remote police and criminal cases were escorted by the Water Police Department to the Special District Court for trial. The "Dadao Water Patrol Team" is in the Pudong along the wharves and the Chinese wharves in Zhabei. As for the foreign warehouse wharves in Pudong, such as Longmao, Jardine Matheson, etc., incidents are still handled by the Water Police Department. Now the "Dadao Water Patrol Team" obviously wants to dominate its "water police authority" over the Huangpu River. However, the Huangpu River and Bailianjing, etc., and the western section of the Suzhou River, which were originally under the jurisdiction of the "Water Patrol Team", have been designated as a security line for the guerrilla zone by the Japanese army. Therefore, the Water Patrol Team is absolutely unable to station anyone or exercise its duties.</p>

<h3>Qingyu Lane Relocation Case - The Court Orders a Trial Reconciliation - The Poor Children's Home and the Women's Bank Extend the Renovation Agreement - Tenants Discover Evidence, Retrial Yesterday</h3>
<p>The houses in Qingyu Lane, Chongqing Road, owned by the Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute, were leased by the Shanghai Women's Bank, and there was a contract with a lease term ending on December 31, 1938. At that time, the Women's Bank must renovate the houses. Otherwise, the Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute will confiscate the Women's Bank's deposit of 49,000 yuan and may claim compensation for losses of 150,000 yuan. Therefore, last winter, the Women's Bank ordered all tenants to relocate in order to renovate the houses. However, the three thousand tenants, because of the extraordinary times, the demand for housing in Shanghai exceeded supply, and it was impossible to find so many houses at once, so they expressed their opposition.</p>
<p>Which led to litigation.</p>
<p>The Women's Bank lost the first trial, but the second and third trial judgments followed the Women's Bank's request and ordered the tenants to relocate. When the time for execution came, before receiving a mandatory execution order from the court, the Women's Bank hired workers to build bamboo fences around Qingyu Lane, intending to forcibly demolish the houses. This led to another dispute in which the tenants dismantled the fences as legitimate self-defense to eliminate the infringement. Recently, the tenants suddenly learned that the Women's Bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute had signed a contract to extend the renovation period for three years. Immediately, they hired lawyers Yuan Yang'an and Su Jingqi and filed a</p>
<p>Retrial lawsuit</p>
<p>with the civil court of the High Court No. 2, requesting that the original judgment be overturned, the Shanghai Women's Bank's lawsuit to order relocation be dismissed, and the litigation costs be borne, and because the situation was urgent, requested a preliminary ruling to suspend the execution. They also requested that police officers be immediately ordered to go to the Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute and the office of the institute's legal counsel, lawyer Guo Qiming, to investigate and retrieve the contract for the three-year extension of the renovation period, as well as related documents, to preserve evidence, etc. The High Court No. 2 accepted the complaint and first ordered the police to retrieve the documents that the plaintiff in the retrial requested to investigate,</p>
<p>Actually Retrieved Them.</p>
<p>Later, an order was issued to the Qingyu Lane tenants, allowing the suspension of execution after providing a deposit of 15,000 yuan, and the retrial of the case was approved upon the request of the lane tenants. Yesterday morning, the case was retried by the High Court No. 2 Civil Court President Han Zuzhi, together with Judges Shen Hong and Zhang Qinglan to form a collegiate panel. The Qingyu Lane tenants and lawyers Yuan and Su appeared in court. The Women's Bank also appointed a lawyer to appear in court. The Shanghai Poor Children's Education Institute, as a participant, also appointed lawyer Rong Zhenlong to appear in court. The Chengdu Road Police Department, in order to prevent accidents, had Chinese Chief Detective Feng Ruisheng supervise the Chinese and Western detectives to come to the court for prevention. First, lawyer Yuan stated the</p>
<p>Reasons for retrial,</p>
<p>briefly stating that the reason why the Women's Bank sued the retrial plaintiffs for relocation was based on the contract signed with the Poor Children's Education Institute, because if the house was not renovated by the end of 1938, the Women's Bank would suffer a loss of 200,000 yuan. Now, the retrial plaintiffs have found that before the end of the debate in the original case's second trial, the contract had been extended for three years by mutual agreement. This can be proved by the documents retrieved by the court. Therefore, since the renovation period has been extended and the rent has been reduced by 20%, the statements made in the original trial</p>
<p>Were completely false,</p>
<p>causing more than three thousand tenants to suffer an unfavorable judgment and almost face the hardship of displacement. Now that there is this strong evidence, we should apply to the court for a retrial to overturn the original judgment and issue a judgment dismissing the retrial defendant's application, etc. Then, the court ordered lawyers Zhou Zhiyi and Guo Qiming and Guo Shouchun, the director of the Poor Children's Education Institute, to come to court to testify that the fact that the extension contract was signed, and the lawyer representing the Women's Bank stated that the signing of this contract was precisely because it would be difficult to achieve</p>
<p>Renovation purposes</p>
<p>before the expiration of the original contract, in order to avoid a loss of 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the contract was signed, but it did not mean that the Women's Bank had no intention of renovating. The court immediately advised both parties to reconcile and not to act emotionally again. Lawyer Yuan stated that the tenants had always been willing to reconcile with the Women's Bank and had repeatedly asked celebrities to mediate, but they were rejected. At this point, the court announced that the case would be adjourned and ordered both parties to go out and try to reconcile.</p>
<h3>Students Conspire with Detectives - Committing Assault - Sentenced to Punishment</h3>
<p>Zou Zhengzhi, the class president of the third grade of high school at the private Shanghai Middle School on Chengdu Road, usually had disagreements with his classmate Fang Yi. On the morning of September 20, at 10:30 am, he conspired with his former classmates Wang Biqing and Li Boqing, who are now working as detectives for the French Police, to go to the school dormitory and severely beat Fang, causing serious injuries. After the incident, Chief Detective Ding Huaguo of the Xinzha Police Department arrested Zou, Wang, and Li and escorted them to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. Now Fang's injuries have gradually healed. Under the interrogation of Judge Fu yesterday morning, Zou Zhengzhi was sentenced to 50 days of detention, and Wang and Li were each sentenced to four months in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Woman Refuses to Marry - Man Asks for Contract to be Terminated - Court Orders Mediation to No Avail</h3>
<p>Wang Hengsen, a mailman from Ningbo working in the Express Mail Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration, also known as Wang Guantao (23 years old, resident of K-33, Xitaihua Lane, Beijiangxi Road), with both parents alive, was introduced by Wang Yiye and Hong Zengzhi and engaged to Mi Weiji, the daughter of Mi Yaozhang, the owner of the Xintaihe Tobacco and Paper Shop at 518 Pushi Road. Mi's daughter is 29 years old, with a beautiful appearance and a secondary education. However, because she was not yet an adult, her parents made the decision to engage her. The wedding date was set for the 14th of this month. However, a rift suddenly appeared between the man and woman, and the woman's father notified the man's house to postpone the wedding, but Wang refused, leading to a dispute. Later, a reconciliation was reached, and it was still allowed to hold the wedding as scheduled. Unexpectedly, as the wedding date approached, the woman's father suddenly notified the man again, asking for a postponement, and temporarily refused to get into the car and enter the door. Wang had no choice but to return in disappointment. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now Wang has filed a petition with the Civil Court of the Special Court No. 2, against Mi Yaozhang and Mi Weiji, father and daughter, requesting the termination of the engagement. The opposing party, through lawyer Shen Zongyong, submitted a defense, opposing the man's request to terminate the engagement. The case was heard by Judge Yu Jian on the morning of the day before yesterday. The opposing party did not arrive, only stating that one party had arrived in court. After briefly stating the reasons for the application, the court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Luring and Selling Young Girls into Prostitution - Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhang You, a woman from Suzhou, is 29 years old and has been running brothels in the Tianjin area of North China. She came to Shanghai in the winter of last year to find beautiful women, spending money to buy Liu Dayuan, a 17-year-old woman from Changshu, and Zhang Heyuan, a 16-year-old woman from Changshu. After the transaction was completed in the Dacheng Apartment on Pushi Road in the French Concession, on December 14 of the same year, Zhang led the two women on the Taikoo Company's Shuntian steamer to Tianjin. Just as they were about to set sail and leave the country, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongtang, detectives from the China Women and Children Relief Association, together with Wang Songshan, a detective from the Water Police Department, boarded the ship and discovered them. They were detained together and transferred to the French Police Department for escort to the Special Court No. 2 for prosecution in accordance with the law. The initial trial resulted in Zhang being sentenced to one year and six months in prison for intending to profit and luring women under the age of 20 away from their families. During the appeal period, she was allowed to provide a cash guarantee of 1,000 yuan and provide a store guarantee that she would be available whenever summoned. Liu and Zhang were found to have been lured and sold. Their parents were summoned and allowed to take them back. Later, Zhang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court No. 3. The result of the trial was a change in the legal provisions, but the sentence was still one year and six months in prison. Zhang still refused to accept the verdict and filed a third appeal with the Shanghai Special District Court of the Supreme Court, hoping for a further acquittal. The Special Court of the Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and found that the facts of the second trial judgment were still unclear. Therefore, it overturned the original judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. After receiving the judgment and case file, the High Court No. 3 held a collegiate panel for a new trial yesterday afternoon, consisting of President Wu Tingqi and Judges Wang and Chen. Only the appellant Zhang and her defense lawyer arrived. Liu Dayuan, Zhang Heyuan, Liu Chushi, Zhang Huisheng, Yang Yunhua's wife, and Zhang Heyuan's sister, who were summoned as witnesses, did not arrive. After the court questioned Zhang about the reasons for the appeal, it summoned the investigating detective Chen Shaoting and others for questioning. Because the facts of the case still need to be investigated, it was decided to postpone the trial and question them again at a later date. Zhang still paid the original guarantee.</p>
<h3>Case of Intimidating Bank Employees - Both Parties Convicted - Each Sentenced to Two Months in Prison with a Two-Year Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>Zhang Lingyun, a Suzhou employee of the Yongcheng Silver Company at 241 Room, Central Exchange Building, on Edward Road, who used high-interest rates to exploit people, previously hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 2, accusing Bi Haomin, the owner of the Bidexing Raincoat Company at 35 Rue Massenet, of using a pistol to forcibly intimidate him. However, Bi claimed that he only had a dispute with Zhang over housing matters at the time and there was no intimidation, so he also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The case has been concluded by Judge Wu, and the judgment was announced yesterday. Bi Haomin was found guilty of interfering with personal freedom and sentenced to two months of imprisonment. If a fine is paid in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence.

Xu was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked down, the wheels fracturing both of Xu's leg bones. He was taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment, according to reports.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital Report</h3>
<p>Outpatient visits: 21,186; Inpatients: 482; Inpatient days: 7,993; Male suicides: 36; Female suicides: 51; Inpatient surgical procedures: 178; Outpatient surgical procedures: 299; Factory-related injuries: 39; Patients sent by the Shanghai Municipal Police: 429; Patients sent by the French Police: 52; Deliveries: 30; X-ray examinations: 676; Prescriptions filled: 21,668. Overviewing the above figures, the hospital's workload has decreased by 10% compared to last month, mainly due to the reduction of summer illnesses. Currently, one of the most serious problems in the hospital's work is the treatment of tuberculosis. The incidence of this disease has not shown any signs of decreasing.</p>
<h3>YMCA Announces Vocational Introduction Registration – Daily from 9 AM to 12 PM – Register at the YMCA on Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has always considered serving young people as its responsibility. In recent years, the number of young people who have dropped out of school and are unemployed has increased dramatically. The YMCA has done its best to provide relief, with remarkable results. Currently, the cost of living in Shanghai is extremely high, and the number of unemployed people is greater than ever before. Among them are those with specialized skills, but without an introduction, they feel there is nowhere to be employed. On the other hand, there is a demand for talent, but there is no place to recruit it. The YMCA used to have a vocational introduction department, but it was suspended due to certain reasons. Now, in order to match supply and demand and reduce unemployment panic, the YMCA has reopened the vocational introduction registration at its Sichuan Road location, with registration hours set from 9 AM to 12 PM daily, which is truly good news for the unemployed.</p>
<h3>Patricide Case – Written Justification for Judgment – Zhou Jing and Her Two Sons Will Appeal</h3>
<p>The sensational patricide case has been judged by Judge Fu Lin of the First Special Court. The two sons, Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxang, were sentenced to death for jointly murdering a lineal ascendant relative, deprived of their civil rights for life. Their mother, Zhou Jing, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for assisting in damaging the body. All details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Zhou Jing, Zhou Qinji, and Zhou Qinxang are dissatisfied with the judgment and have entrusted their agents, lawyers Yang Lizhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng, to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. Zhou Jing's statement of appeal has already been submitted, and the court's judgment has also been sent out separately yesterday. Since the main points and facts in the judgment have already appeared in previous reports, they are omitted here. The reasoning for the judgment is excerpted below. Investigation of the facts of the case is based on the defendants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxang's own admission without denial. They were apprehended on the spot while dismembering the body. The corpse of the deceased, Zhou Yongjie, was examined and verified by the court's prosecutor along with the forensic doctor, confirming that he had been electrocuted to death before dismemberment. Furthermore, one end of the electric wire found was still attached to the deceased's hair. Their description of the murder before and after, the electric wires and saws purchased from various stores, were verified by the police by checking the invoices from those stores submitted to the case, which can serve as corroborating evidence. Therefore, there is no doubt that they jointly killed a lineal ascendant relative and damaged the body in an attempt to cover up their traces. However, damaging the body was a result of the murder, and according to the law, a more severe punishment should be imposed for one of the crimes. According to both defendants, after killing their father, they stole and hid his savings passbook and cash, so the reason for the patricide does not seem to be solely due to the abuse of their mother by their father. Even if they could not bear to see their mother being tortured day by day, they still deliberately and thoughtfully caused him to suffer such a tragic death. After their father died, they were not moved in the slightest and calmly prepared knives and saws to dismember his body. As individuals who have received secondary education, they dared to commit such a heinous act. If they are not given the most severe punishment, it would not be enough to deter others. When Zhou Yongjie was dying, he shouted loudly, so the sound he made must have been different from usual. Zhou Jing was already startled, yet she did not go to check immediately. It was not until she saw the light on in her son's bedroom that she asked what they were doing. Therefore, it cannot be said that she had no knowledge of her son's murder of her father. However, she firmly claimed that she knew nothing beforehand, and the Zhou Qinji brothers also claimed that they had planned the murder in the French Park and only informed their mother afterwards. Since there is no other positive evidence, Zhou Jing cannot be held equally responsible for the crime of murder. However, according to the statements of the Zhou Qinji brothers and the report of the deputy section chief, they later discussed cutting up the body with knives. Zhou Jing heard about it in advance and did not stop them. When they were carrying out the act, she also carried the key to the balcony door and restrained the maid in the kitchen downstairs. Therefore, her intention to assist in dismembering the body and her actions beyond dismemberment are undeniable. The charging article of law should be changed to consider her as an accessory to damaging the body. Even if she could not bear to expose her son's crimes, she did not think of her marital bond and allowed her husband to suffer the tragedy of dismemberment, which is also unforgivable. However, she is an accomplice and should have her punishment reduced by one-third of the principal offender's sentence. Summarizing the above conclusions, based on Article 291 (first paragraph) of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 272 (first paragraph), Article 247 (first paragraph), Article 28, Article 55, Article 30, Article 66 (first paragraph), Article 16, Article 37 (first paragraph), and Article 38 (first paragraph, item 2) of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in Shandong and here in the East China Sea will be cloudy and clear and cold, with gentle northwesterly to northeasterly winds and localized morning fog. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city reached a high of 71.4 degrees and a low of 55.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the high was 70.3 degrees and the low was 61.9 degrees.</p>
<h3>Burning Incense and Kneeling in Reverence - Foreman Dies Strangely</h3>
<p>According to Shewen News Agency, Jiang Mashou, a 45-year-old native of Nantong residing at No. 26, Lane 147, Aierkaoke Road, Public Concession, was usually a foreman. Yesterday morning at around 7 AM, Jiang got up and, as he enjoyed reciting scriptures and worshiping Buddha, followed his usual practice of lighting incense and candles in his living room and bowing reverently. Unexpectedly, while worshiping, he suddenly collapsed to the ground and did not get up. After a long time, his family noticed that he was lying stiffly on the ground, barely breathing. They urgently called for a car and sent him to Hudong Hospital, but Jiang had already died on the way. The cause of death in this case is strange, and the police are currently investigating.</p>

<h3>Priority</h3>
<p>— Peichu</p>
<p>The fundamental and the superficial, priority and sequence, are all things we should understand. Understanding them "is close to the Way," although the definition of this "Way" is difficult to determine. For now, let's not discuss the fundamental and the superficial, but talk about priority.</p>
<p>In fact, priority is just a method of handling affairs. On a small scale, for example, in personal life, there are things that should be done first and things that should be done later. If the order is reversed, our affairs will not succeed. On a large scale, as for national affairs, it is indeed necessary to carefully determine priorities and proceed step by step, neither skipping levels nor procrastinating.</p>
<p>However, if it is a large-scale matter, such as resisting Japan and saving the country, with thousands of threads to untangle, it is certainly necessary to sort out a priority, and within the priorities, it is necessary to sort out the first priority, which requires us to think even more carefully. The reason for thinking, of course, is precisely in relation to each person's environment and the circumstances of the time and place. So, for us people on the isolated island, what exactly is our top priority?</p>
<p>I believe that our first priority now is to collect and donate winter clothing. As for the reasons why, I don't think it's necessary for me to elaborate on them here. The weather is already cold, and soon it will be very cold. We are wearing warm clothes, shouldn't we consider those who have no winter clothing?</p>
<p>It is already obvious that things within the same scope should be distinguished by their priority, and for things in two or more different scopes, I believe we should also compare their priority. For example, between personal and group matters, we should prioritize group matters, and between group and national matters, we should prioritize national matters, which is also beyond dispute. Such comparisons may indeed come before distinguishing things within the same scope.</p>
<p>The so-called priority, to put it bluntly, is just asking us to look at the importance of the matter and ourselves. The important should come first, and ourselves can be put later. Let each of us ask ourselves, are we putting ourselves first or the priority first? I am willing to risk being seen as "a broken record" and ask everyone to reflect. (Move for donations of winter clothing.)</p>
<h3>Deserted City</h3>
<p>— Shi Weisi</p>
<p>Bamboo leaves float in groups in the stream towards the distant evening colors, like light boats on a distant expedition. In my pupils is a scene of autumn mountains by an ancient ferry at sunset. I feel lighter than a swallow, wanting to chase the white clouds in the sky with a stroke of the setting sun. I begin my fantasy.</p>
<p>Fantasy is more appropriately said to be a reproduction of my own footsteps, towards a deserted city, standing alone by an ancient ferry. Yes, leaping over ten thousand mountain peaks, the complaints of the grass under my feet gradually subside. I am familiar with this road. That crumbling wall, that ruined ruin, that expanse of black tiles and red walls, the towering three gates... Sailing in a small boat through the golden ripples in the setting sun, I glimpse the bamboo curtain hiding a low building. Although it is already sealed with spider silk, on the desolate gray wall, should there still be a dark shadow left behind, filled with melancholy?</p>
<p>The memory will be clearer. Two months of loneliness like days in a tomb passage! Mornings have rooster crows, and nights have the wind sending distant cold watches to the small building. Outside the window, the great mountains and rivers are not seen by an elder leaning on a cane, smiling gently in the wind on the plank bridge. Everywhere is just the trace of sparrow chirps. The small door is blocked by the bamboo forest, singing rustling songs, which feels colder than the gurgling water under the bridge. My young heart of twenty years old seems to have transformed into a thin old man sweeping fallen leaves against the autumn wind. One broom after another, it can't be swept clean. One night of autumn wind, and the steps and windowsills are full again.</p>
<p>I am willing to linger in this world. I love the slanting wind and fine rain, facing a green lamp, with a melancholy shadow. What should be remembered are the fish in the pond, competing for the rice sprinkled in hand under the tired sunlight, the carved railings on the pavilions in the old garden, more than ten years ago, passing through one rockery after another, catching the old dream of asking Aunt for impatiens... Sometimes I really want to paint a picture of the dozens of fishermen on the other side of the stream, wearing bamboo hats and holding fishing rods, making ingenious tricks. A large part of humanity is born to be decorations in paintings. Imagining the brave act of carrying a hunting gun and torch to climb the mountains and forests, the thrilling sledding that leaps onto the ice mountains in the snow, rushing into the water in summer and swimming from one end of the Yangtze River to the other... etc., and fishing. (Those things, once in my own hands, make me completely clumsy.) However, I am not like the maiden in the boudoir, looking at the willows at the edge of the road, longing for the soldier! That painting seems too delicate. I have indeed spent mornings and mornings alone by the window. I want to paint that plank bridge, the people appear so humble, and it's not clear whose faces they are.</p>
<p>A friend said: Another month like that, and your irritable and sensitive heart will become a little gentler, a little calmer!</p>
<p>But I say, I miss another deserted city even more! Another deserted city, yes, carrying a baggage alone, walking slowly in the desert sea, suddenly a strange wind comes from the horizon, and the body rolls with the yellow sand. When it stops, my baggage and all my wealth for survival in the baggage are gone! Only a clear stream is seen, and I see my own strange shadow in the clear stream. I get up and walk, disregarding the fatigue of my feet, and then I arrive at another deserted city. In the deserted city, besides the footsteps of a wandering traveler, not a living soul is seen, not a wisp of smoke is seen. Now, open your ancient books and see that in the lines eaten by bookworms, there is a passage: The An Lushan Rebellion, or the massacre by the White Lotus Sect, when the soldiers arrive at a place, not a man, woman, or child escapes. After the slaughter is over, they leave, and then for hundreds of years, or decades, a deserted city remains. That is this deserted city! The ground and grass still flow with the blood of the Middle Ages, and there are ancient heads in the ruined walls and tiles. I walk alone as if returning to a medieval country, following the footprints of strange birds and butterflies! I tell you, in that other deserted city, I established another world with my bare hands, a double bunker, a tall building!</p>
<p>Writing this, I still do not forget that this is just a fantasy. Facing the green lamp, spreading out white paper, I suddenly despair of my fantasy being too naive! I should unravel his dream like a warrior with practice, and transform it into a greater joy. But in reality, even looking at the clear stream and watching the bamboo leaves flow towards the distant evening mountains, it should be said to be too neurotic. I seem to have one foot on a light boat, floating, and the other foot is stabbed in the grass by insects, causing heartache.</p>
<h3>Literary Men and Poverty</h3>
<p>— Muchang</p>
<p>It seems that literary men have always been inextricably linked to poverty since ancient times.</p>
<p>In the long process of historical labor, after the separation of mental labor and muscle labor, it lost its significance of production; and literary men, the mental laborers, later became even more distant from farmers, workers, craftsmen, and even factory owners, landlords, and merchants in all forms of life. Their skills have never been enough to cope with "carrying loads" or "collecting taxes," and they, as middle layers, always have the tragic fate of being poor. Of course, the few literary men from wealthy families are another matter.</p>
<p>Sima Xiangru wearing a loincloth seemed to be a great shame for literary men, but shouting loudly: "Get a bowl of original flavor, please" was more active than secretly writing the Fengshan essay at home, which might as well be a self-mockery.</p>
<p>Of course, truly relying on the "nature" of literary men is not enough to dazzle the world. It is indeed true that in modern times, when the concrete crystallization of mental labor (?)—writing—has become a commodity, literary men cannot raise their heads to breathe a sigh of relief; even if articles have market prices that can be immediately dumped on the market, the hands often write themselves off, let alone the fact that they may not necessarily be so. Some "climbing the dragon" often happens outside of writing, which is a common lament throughout ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>Therefore, some literary men of the older generation often warn young people: Being a literary man is too hard, too hard! The meaning between the lines seems to want Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie to disband their group, holding their alms bowls and begging for alms, and stop reciting scriptures. But this warning of "no through road" only makes those with ambitions lose some courage. There are not few people in the world who cannot be literary men but insist on being so, knowing that they will be stained with poverty and not have enough to enjoy for a lifetime, so why write books for "literary youth"?</p>
<p>So someone cleverly pointed out "side occupations" to make up for it: those who write articles come to teach, those who teach come to pull carts... the former are still literary men, but the latter provide material for newspaper reporters. But poverty is still poverty.</p>
<p>Some literary men who want to make up for poverty inevitably want to find a wonderful side occupation. For example: "Playing ball." They use their skilled mental labor to calculate what angle the ball should be at and how to hit it well. However, applying it to writing may result in good articles, but on the field, it's always a bit "that," and most of it is not a large "capital." (?) As a result, they naturally fall short. Dostoevsky is still a poor man, letting the landlady give him cold sarcasm.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a strong desire to "befriend" big merchants, but first they must pass the difficulty of "blushing and turning red," and must understand more about "market conditions."</p>
<p>It is natural that "wonderful" paths are blocked, so some want to "change careers" thoroughly—what if they don't take this road? A father said to his son who wants to be a writer: "You have to be a politician to succeed!" This is quite straightforward. But some kind of seed seems not to be able to be cultivated. Some people get upset when they hear the sound of abacuses or computers, so they just give up.</p>
<p>In fact, looking at the entire social structure: "fiddling with the abacus" is not more meaningful than "wielding the pen," although the latter is not necessarily beneficial. Literary men sometimes caress their own works, feeling a vague comfort, which is a reward, but not all of it. Even for the likes of Liu Yong, who are romantic by nature, and where there is well water, there are lyrics, which may not be enjoyable, let alone that Karl is enough to explain the world with the crystallization of his labor. But the regret is that the calligraphies were cheated away by salt merchants, and hanging in people's living rooms has always been used to prop up their faces, which is also something that those who are "hard to be confused" can't help. The problem is: calligraphy does not express anything, it is just for elegant enjoyment.</p>
<p>Literary men are poor, but there are those who are even poorer; if they sigh for poverty, do they want to get rich suddenly—which is a sign of decline.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves: Is our faith firm? - Naturally, "talking coolly," believing in "gold yuan" makes them no longer poor. Similarly, is life regular? - But only hiding in the "study" to find words and pick sentences, deliberately weaving, distorting, only sees his own mental labor, but a leisure (money) play.</p>
<p>"Scholars starve to death is a common thing." Today's literary men are naturally not as stupid as before, but there are absolutely opposite paths: one is: tempering their muscles and bones (five cents per thousand words is fine, one cent per day for living expenses still has to climb mountains, what is there to be afraid of); otherwise, the other is: selling their souls.</p>
<p>Under the War of Resistance, literary men are even clearer in their faces: the gray ones are still..., poor?</p>

<h3>Luo Jingyu Takes "Paradise in the Isolated Island" to Chongqing to Screen for Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>— Cuiping</p>
<p>Proposing Three Requirements to Resolve the Aftermath</p>
<p>Luo Jingyu, the technical section chief of the Chongqing National China Film Studio, came to Hong Kong this spring to rent the photography studio of Qiming Film Company, created the Dadi Film Company, and hired famous directors such as Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin, and Tan Youliu to produce national defense films as a banner. When it was first established, the outside world suspected that Dadi was a Hong Kong branch of the China Film Studio, but in fact, all capital was raised by Luo personally, and it was independently operated, except that some machinery was borrowed from the Chongqing China Film Studio. The first decision was to produce "Paradise in the Isolated Island," directed by Cai Chusheng, written by Zhao Yingcai, and jointly starred by Li Lili, Li Qing, and members of the China Art Troupe. The film took four months of work time and cost HK$40,000 to complete. The film has been screened in Hong Kong, and although the business record is higher than ordinary domestic films, it is still at risk of loss due to the excessive cost. It is estimated that "Paradise in the Isolated Island" could be completed with HK$15,000, but unexpectedly exceeded the budget by more than double. Therefore, after the completion of this film, Dadi Company's economy also fell into a very difficult situation, and the second film "White Clouds Hometown" had to be temporarily suspended, because the current income of "Paradise in the Isolated Island" must first be used to pay off creditors. Luo Jingyu plans to take the film to Chongqing and screen it for Chairman Chiang. If Chairman Chiang is satisfied after watching the film, and it is effective for anti-Japanese propaganda, then please Chairman Chiang exceptionally allow the income from the screening of "Paradise in the Isolated Island" in various provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan to be used to buy foreign exchange and send it to Hong Kong, as funding for Dadi Company to continue filming, or please Chairman Chiang provide the company with a certain amount of regular expenses on a monthly basis, or move Dadi Company to Kunming. Luo Jingyu has taken the film to Chongqing for one of these requests to be approved by Chairman Chiang, so how the filming work of Dadi will proceed in the future will not be decided until Luo returns to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Chatting about Wang Qingchen</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhengku</p>
<p>The Xindu Theater, which has been preparing for a long time, has not yet opened. Once there were rumors that Jin Suqin, Lin Shusen, and Zhang Yipeng would form a troupe, but it ended up as a pipe dream. Now it has become a reality after brewing, and the internal organization is ready. It is planned to officially open on the first day of next month. The recruited famous actors are all the best of the time. It is heard that the internal cast includes female lead Yu Sulan, scholar-warrior leading man Yang Ruiting, leading man Wang Qingchen, and warrior Zhao Songqiao, etc. At that time, we will be able to refresh our eyes and ears. However, Qingchen has been away from Shanghai for a long time, and I am afraid that the opera lovers in Shanghai have felt unfamiliar with him, so I record a brief account of him as follows:</p>
<p>According to Qingchen, he graduated from Jinling University and was one of the earliest amateurs to go into the opera business. He loves Peking opera and has been immersed in it for a long time. He has a deep understanding of Tan school operas. He is now 48 years old. He first studied martial arts actors, then sang leading man roles. He apprenticed to veteran opera singer Rui Debao, and he is particularly good at helmet and armor plays. Twenty years ago, he once succeeded Xiao Yu in performing at the Yitai Theater (stage owner Shen Shaoan, also known as Monk) and the First Stage (stage owner Yun Hongqing), and he was well received at that time. Later, he went north to seek further education and studied with the famous amateur Wang Junzhi. Junzhi valued his talent and accepted him as a disciple, and he taught him everything about the Tan style, word by word and note by note. He also humbly learned privately from Xiao Yu, and he was almost indistinguishable. For a period of time, he paired with Xiao Yun, which helped him a lot. In recent years, his art has become more refined, and his singing and acting have become more pure. He has performed in Tianjin and other places, and he is well known wherever he goes. This time, he came to Shanghai to avoid the war. Through the introduction of Liu Binkun, he joined Xindu to cooperate with Ruiting. It can be called a beautiful combination, and it will be able to compete with Baosen and Shaolin.</p>
<h3>Recent Events in the Arts</h3>
<p>Miss Wang Xichun has recently risen to prominence on the silver screen, starring in "The Twenty-Second Episode of Wen Suchen," which has been filmed and test-screened with great success. The Universal Company is now filming the stage play "Consort Xiang's Regret" as a movie and has rehired her for the leading role. It is also reported that she started filming at the China United Film Studio the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The young and famous opera singer Mr. Gu Zhenxiang is renowned among contemporary performers for specializing in young male roles, achieving momentary fame. He performs the pheasant-feather-crowned student with elegance and grace, his voice and appearance both excellent. His skill is considered comparable to that of Yu Zhenfei. The Xian Ni Society Kun opera troupe, recently affiliated with "Da Luo Tian," has invited him as a guest performer. Tonight (the 28th), he will take the stage to try out the play "First Practice of Selling Horses." His co-star will be the famous Dan actress Zhu Chuanming. Their collaboration will be a perfect match and is expected to be highly entertaining.</p>
<p>Miss Gu Lanjun is now going to star in a color film. The script is titled "Happy Rivals," and is being produced with funding from cinematographer Yan Heming. Li Pingqian has been hired as the director, and Sun Min and Liu Qiong will play the male leads. It is said that this color film is being shot using "Kodak" special film stock. After filming, it will be transported to the United States for development by airmail. The cost of sending it by airplane is very high, and this is an initial attempt. Only four-tenths of the color film has been shot so far, so it is not yet entirely in color.</p>
<p>The Xinhua Company also plans to film Miss Chen Yunshang's fourth work, "Sakyamuni," as a color film. They are collaborating with a German technician on the method, and negotiations are currently underway, making realization quite possible. (Silver Silk)</p>
<h3>Shadows of the Dance World</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian (47)</p>
<p>Going to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Going to Hong Kong, perhaps, some dancers who have gone to Hong Kong have returned fully loaded. Two days ago, a friend of mine nicknamed Wang Bo received a letter from Hong Kong from a dancer named Fang Lili, which was forwarded from here. In her letter, she said that business in Hong Kong dance halls is now even more sluggish, while prices are several times higher than before. Logically, now that foreign exchange is slightly looser than before, prices should not continue to rise. As for the sluggish dance market, it is probably due to the return of the group of Shanghai residents who had been living there.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan dancers Shu Yunlan and Shu Yunzhu will both leave for Hong Kong on the 31st of this month. Their motive for going to Hong Kong has been brewing for a long time, and it has only now come to fruition, but it is a bit late. People have been giving them farewell dinners these days, and I have tagged along as a guest a few times. They told me that they will stay there for three months this time, and their mothers are going with them. The dance hall will provide travel expenses and accommodation, and the salary is still under consideration. Because if they want to receive a salary, the corresponding condition is to sell a certain number of dance tickets.</p>
<p>They are both underage children. Yunzhu is truly innocent and carefree. She said, "When I get to Hong Kong, the first letter I write will definitely be to you." I asked her if she knew how to write it? She took a pencil and a small notebook from her purse and started writing. She wouldn't let me watch while she wrote, and only handed it to me after she finished. I found it very cute, and I couldn't help but smile. She wrote, "To Master's feet, with respect. Having bid farewell to your esteemed countenance, I am overwhelmed with longing..." I said, "You must have studied in school for a few years. Did you copy this from a textbook? But you used the phrase 'at your feet' incorrectly. These words can only be used for your parents." She said, "Isn't Master the same as my father? Why can't I use it? What should I use for Master?" I thought this child was very good, and it's a pity she's learning to be a dancer. I told her a little about the meaning of "at your feet" and cited the story of Lao Laizi wearing colorful clothes to please his parents. She was very perceptive, but I don't think she could understand the meaning of "to the honored desk of the master," so I only taught her to write "to the respected presence of Master" and a few common idioms used in letters. After dinner, I went to the Metropolitan and saw her often drawing on paper with a pencil in her spare time while accompanying dances. I thought, why do so many children with the money to go to school often skip class?</p>

<h3>Extracurricular Chronicles of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>At this time, Xijiao has already been killed by Third Master Song, severing their relationship and breaking their vows. How could he possibly reward Mother Yan with a tael of gold worth three hundred taels of silver? That's why I dare to judge that it must be another ten taels of silver. Don't think that many opera singers who often perform this play, if they don't carefully study the plot or only know what is supposed to happen without knowing why, I think they will certainly mistake the ten taels of silver used to buy a coffin for Mother Yan as the tael of gold just taken from Xijiao's corpse. Since we are determined to study drama, we cannot ignore these small details.</p>
<h3>The Strange Cases of Killing a Son for Revenge and Killing a Father</h3>
<p>"Killing a Son for Revenge" is also known as "The Strange Case of Nantong." This play once caused a sensation. Later, officials banned the play because the first part involved obscenity and was harmful to social morals. Moreover, this play was not particularly exciting in terms of performance. Most of the performers were female performers who could only perform small eight-part plays with female roles. Famous male actors disdained to perform it. In recent years, however, female Dan actors such as Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu have strived to reach higher levels, and their skills are comparable to those of male actors. Even if officials do not stop it, Dan actors will certainly not want to use this play to attract customers.</p>
<p>According to the plot of the play, a mother kills her son and chops his body into eight pieces, placing them in a basket. This is extremely cruel. However, unexpectedly, many years later, a rebellious case of a son killing his father occurred in Shanghai. After the killing, he also used dismemberment methods, preparing to put the body in a box to try to cover up the traces. Looking at these two cases, they seem to be distantly related. The most incomprehensible thing is that both events occurred in Jiangsu Province, which is known for its culture and education. Nantong is known as a model county, and Shanghai is a special area where culture gathers and both Chinese and foreigners pay attention. Nantong is not far away. Now, such cruel and violent things have happened one after another. This must also be attributed to the poor quality of our country's education and the gradual decline of old morality, which has led to this. (129)</p>
