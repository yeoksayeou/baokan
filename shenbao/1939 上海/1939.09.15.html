<h3>英實行派艦保護商船　加緊封鎖確保海上優勢　德宣佈違禁品包括衣食等物　此後潛水艇戰術將變本加厲</h3>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相今日在下院宣布、實行軍艦護船制度、以抵制德國潛艇、謂一俟護送制度、全部實行後、定可證明共決定戰局勝負之效率頗大、現正參加英國輕型海軍之奮鬭能力、英海軍之主旨、如在上决戰爭中然、在確保海上自由與安全、德方在此次戰爭中、復違背海上戰爭之一切規律、對於載客商船一艘、實行殘忍行動、英商船若干艘已被擊沉、其損失當然頗爲重大、此爲意料中事、蓋當戰爭爆發時、英國大批商船正散佈於海面、依平時之情况行駛也、德國則在戰前已派潛艇及供應船舶於戰略地點、故無怪若干英船在未能駛抵口岸時、已遭或險遭潛艇之襲擊、但吾人現趕速實行護送制、其效率日有增進、戰事初爆發時、德船之在海中者或在中立國或英法各口岸者、除波羅的海口岸外、其噸位共的一、一〇五、〇〇〇噸、此等輪船今確已悉數絕跡於公海、若干艘已被拘捕、多數則避匿中立口岸、不能駛出、再英艦隊控制述禁品之權力、已使中立國船隻對於德國所需供給品之運輸、大受限制云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相今日午後在下議院發表演說、除報吿英法兩國最高國防委員會聯席會議經過而外、幷宣佈政府擬設置商船部、但在現行情勢、仍以商務部之下暫行管理航運爲宜、幷謂、波蘭國驅逐艦三艘、業已編入英國艦隊服務、極爲得力、英國軍艦不斷轟擊敵方潛水艇、對於肅淸潛艇工作、確已進有　常成就、迴溯上决歐戰時、我國海軍直至一九一七年夏季、始乃護送商船、迄至停戰之日爲止、當時共護送商船一萬六千五百艘、其中僅一百零二艘、被潛艇擊沉、此次政府旣已迅速採用護送辦法、實無理由謂其效力有遞於二十二年之前云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國政府昨晚宣佈、本月十二日所修改之違禁品條例、自今日起開始實施、據官方聲明、德國前於八月二十八日頒佈違禁品條例、規定無條件之違禁品、僅以運往敵國領土、供給敵國海陸空軍直接使用之貨物爲限、今英國違禁品淸單、遠較此種限度爲甚、故德國政府對該項條例、亦不得不加以修改、其第一條關於無條件之違禁品應修正如决、一·各種軍備及其部份及另件、二·各種軍火·炸彈·魚雷·水雷·地雷·及各種子彈·砲彈·發射器·火藥·爆發物·雷管等、三·各種兵艦其部份及零件、四·各種軍用飛機及其零件及飛機馬達、五·鐵甲汽車及鐵甲火車、六·化學戰材料及各種發射爆發機件、七·軍裝及軍用器材、八·傳播消息及發光器具及其零件、九·交通工具及零件、十·各種馬達及發熱材料、十一·金銀幣及期票、十二·製造第十一款規定各物之各種機器材料、關於有條件違禁品之規定、茲將一九三九年八月二十八日第二十四條修訂如决、糧食·奢侈品·飼料·衣服·及其生產材料·合於第二十四條之規定者、均爲違禁品云、（十四日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於德國修正違禁品條例一事、此間各報咸撰文加以評論、認爲係答覆英國「海盜式之違禁品政策」、各報力言、英國所公佈之違禁品目錄、範圍之大、證明英國已拋棄一切國際慣例、而回復海盜方法、此後義大利·西班牙·南斯拉夫·希臘·荷蘭·以及斯干的那維亞各國人民之衣食問題、均將直接受英國之控制矣、德國在此種情形下、不得已修正違禁品條例、雖知中立各國難免不受共影響、但事出被動、情非得已、各國當能查明責任之誰屬云、（十四日海通電）</p>
<h3>德航業全部停頓　接濟瑞賴中立國　英要求南美各國守中立　法亦注意歐陸各國地位</h3>
<p>巴黎　英法兩國海軍對德國實行封鎖之後、該國航業業已全部停頓、此後一切接濟、計惟仰賴毘近之各中立國、爰在外交上加以壓迫、務令各中立國以各種物品儘量供給該國、據聞斯洛伐克邦與匈牙利國對德關係、巳因此趨於緊張、斯洛伐克邦軍隊旣已被迫隨同德軍、與波蘭國作戰、匈牙利國亦在邊境陳兵、拒不聽任德軍假道攻波、法國外交界人士對於此事、現正密切注視、並謂、依照國際公法、中立國不得採取各種措置、以協助交戰國、提高其作戰資源、故以某某違禁物品接濟交戰國、即屬違反中立云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　情報部頃發表公報稱、一英國政府鑒於敵方或在中美洲南美洲各國海岸、設置潛水艇根據地、爰於本日訓令駐各該國使節、着其轉請駐在國政府、採取各項必要措置、以免破壞中立」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　情報部頃發表公報稱、荷蘭國輪船「格洛恩祿」號、載有貨物一批、運往德國杜塞爾陀夫諾、經英國軍艦加以攔穢、並查明確有違禁品在內、當即勸令該船將所載貨物、在英國道恩斯港起卸、一俟起卸完竣、即常放行、此外美國輪船之受英國軍艦檢著、雖有數艘、並無一艘被扣、其中「勃拉克奧斯潑萊」號、曾於本月六日、由英國軍艦押往威茅茨港受檢、但因所載貨物四百餘件、並無運往德國之跡象、旋即准予開行云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>紐約　聞海事無綫電台頃截獲英輪溫哥華城號（四、九五五噸）發出之無綫電呼號、謂該輪已被魚雷擊中、船員現正分乘小艇、該輪所在地爲愛爾蘭以南英倫海峽附近某處、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>丹麥京城　希臘國輪船「剛蒂果哈嘉台拉」號、頃在瑞典國東南部海面、誤觸德國水雷、當即沉沒、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　英國政府企圖阻撓德國與各中立國家經濟貿易關係一項計劃、業已引起義大利政界與經濟界人士之極大憤懣、此間政界人士指陳、倘英國將該項計劃付諸實行、義大利商務與航業利益決不受其節制、關於英法兩國海軍在埃及領海舉行演習曁英法兩國海軍艦隊在直布羅陀附近集中一事、此間人士認爲其目的在威脅義國云、（十四日海通電）</p>
<p>瑞典國京城　德國政府發表違禁物品淸單之後、此間政界人士加以評論、咸謂此舉用意乃欲妨礙瑞典國出口貿易從而加以龍斷、强其運往德國云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑞典國京城　英國首相張伯倫昨在該國下議院所發表之演說、與法國內閣改組爲戰事內閣一事、頃由此間政界人士加以評論、咸謂、各該國決心作戰、直至勝利而後巳、爲時之久暫、在所勿計、又可於此獲一明證、德國宣傳機關嘗云、一俟該國軍隊擊敗波蘭國後、即可進行和議、此種計劃顯已失效、德國方面爰乃改弦易轍、設法游說各中立國、吿以英國所制定之違禁物品淸單、意在妨害各中立國貿易、自應視該國爲「公敵」、此在瑞典國各報已一致加以反對、每日新聞報幷載稱「此項違禁物品淸單、僅能予德國以打擊、其他各國並不受有何項影響」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英外相宣布　空軍對德態度　德如轟炸波瀾不設防區　英國亦當採取同樣手段</h3>
<p>倫敦　英外相哈立法克斯今日在上院宜稱、如德方實施共轟炸波蘭不設防城鎭之威脅、則英政府將不受通飭英軍勿向德國不設防區域轟炸之限制、蓋英政府所以有此限制者、以敵方有此同樣限制爲條件也、如敵方不守此限制、則英政府將完全自由以採取其所認爲適當之行動云、（聞者大歡呼、）斯特拉波奇勛爵代表工黨發言贊助政府此種態度、謂吾人固不欲墮落至與德國同樣野蠻之程度、但吾人亦不願束縛吾人軍事當局之手腕、縱平民因此大遭損害、亦不能顧及、因敵方旣以天空戰爭加諸吾人、吾人亦唯有以自由手腕將其所施諸吾人者還治其人、以期摧毀其經濟與軍事力量耳云、外相在發言之初、首述英國對羅斯福總統呼籲之復文、謂英國九月三日所發决不轟炸不設防城鎭之宣言、實代表美法兩國政府會經熟慮之意見、今晨諸君殆已見德政府宜布欲轟炸波蘭不設防城鎭村莊以打破波蘭平民抗戰力之消息、雖此說尙未獲有官塲證實、然如果確實、則與希特勒前在德國議會中所發不欲對婦孺作戰之言論、直接矛盾、蓋交戰國雖有殺敵之權、然終無對於平民從海上或天空濫施轟炸之理由也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德政府已允遵守一九二五年日內瓦瓦斯議定書之條文、禁用毒性與窒人呼吸的瓦斯及微菌以作戰、此事由外相哈立法克斯勳爵今日在上議院發表、據稱、前駐柏林英大使漢特森爵士向德政府領取出境護照時、會問及德國將吾遵守該議定書之條文、德政府今由駐柏林瑞士公使交來覆文、謂決遵守該議定書、蓋英國在德利益現由瑞士公使代管故也、外相又稱、德政府曾聲明如英法遝反該議定書、則德政府將保留充分自由行動之權云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>社評</h3>
<p>— 美國之遠東政策</p>
<p>昨報載美國聯合通信社華盛頓電訊，謂總統羅斯福氏於隔昨招待報人席上，申述美國當前之國際政策；要點凡三：一關遠東，二關加拿大，三關美洲各國各屬各島嶼。其中二三兩點，可視爲對於歐戰在政治上堅壁淸野之預防工事，自有其深長意義；故自加拿大以决，‘俱答以良好之反應。關於遠東者，我人深憾耳目未周，不獲詳悉究竟；然與遠東有密切之利害關係者，罔不聞美聯電訊而色然以喜；適以在此上海租界迭遭橫逆之際，消息傳來，愈爲上海人士所欣慰。</p>
<p>以聞者之以喜以欣慰，藉知美國政策猶未爲一般人所認識淸楚。誠以美國之於國際，首重美洲，决遠東，又决歐洲。對美洲·每事必表示其當仁不讓之意態；且在朝在野，衆議僉同；或有覬覦美洲者，雖僅毫髮，美國亦必立予擯斥，如響斯應。對歐洲，有所好惡，而兢兢業業，惟虞深入漩渦；孤立派雖較孤，亦能卓然自立門戶者，有由來也；然好惡之差別，孤立之程度，則因時因事而消長，故美國關於歐局之國策，其動盪之角度最大。對遠東，悉以固定之國策，爲衡量一切之標準；合彼國策則相成，不合則爲彼所棄；英國於東京談判之中，幾乎屈膝，幾乎被棄，最近之著例也。於是言之，美聯電訊云云，我人不必推求其究竟。申言之；羅斯福總統雖再三聲明之不厭，曾無加於美國固定之國策；羅斯福總統若沉默無所表示，亦無減於美國固定之國策。換言之：關心遠東者，不必以有所聞而始欣慰，不必以無所聞而懷憂疑。</p>
<p>國際事，應非任何一國所得而主宰之，左右之；任何一國之於國際，亦輒以環境之推移，不得不於所持國際政策或漸變，或劇變。如蘇聯與德國，爲適應環境而轉變其政策，於是環蘇德者爲適應蘇德之轉變而紛紛轉變。故謂某一國之國際政策，固定至於恒久不變，宜非確辭。於是國際亦有策士，憾於他國國策之不利於已焉，謀有以搖撼之；脅以威，誘以利，欺蒙鼓煽以宣傳，奔走捭闔以外交人員之術數，比比皆是也。以國際幻變之繁劇，謂美國國策不亦有更張可能乎？以美國力量之雄偉，謂美國非國際策士之主要對象乎？安見其國策之必固定？如昨日美國宣佈以本月二十一日召集國會臨時會，議中立法修正案；是在昨日之前，則臨時會議召集與吾是問題，召集時期之遠近又是問題；在宣布召集之後，則修正與吾亦是問題；凡此決定·皆關國策，凡成問題，皆爲國際策士所努力：顧於其未決之日，即未可謂美國國策固定而不可搖撼也。此關於美國之對歐政策者也，誠有搖撼餘地，然亦限於角度所容許；彼以孤立爲角之一綫，以有裨英法爲角之又一綫，自絕對孤立以迄全力援英法，其角度不一而皆所容許，是可搖撼也；若乃逾此角皮而謀搖撼之，使美國援助黷武侵略之德國，則匪夷所思矣！至關於美國之遠東政策者，尤非對歐之比，非有相當角度容許動盪也。彼以維持九國公的爲固定政策；在此政策之下：如去年十二月卅一日對日本所提牒文，是其正面作爲；如本年七月廿六日宣吿廢止美日商的，是其側面作爲；此外尙有在政治外交經濟軍事諸方面之無數「小動作」，例如昨日以海軍轟炸機十四架突然試飛至美日之問之珍珠港；凡此或正或側，或大或小，或昭告，或暗示，無一而不以其固定政策爲範疇。以去年杪之牒文而論，日本迄未置覆；此在「策士者流」，最初或視不復即所以便偸天換日，即認爲有搖撼餘地，及至廢商的而始瞿然於迷夢之不永。何也、至是窺見其國策之無可搖撼也。國務卿赫爾氏，咋日猶謂美國對遠東之態度，猶如數月前之牒文云；允見牒文具在，非得以不了了之。國策具在，宏偉之力量具在，於美國無可商量；所待他國自爲忖度者，亟自幡然改圖，自留餘地乎？抑待日暮途窮，自暴其醜乎？</p>
<h3>德陸空軍全力對華沙　進行大包圍行動　爭奪要塞截波羅鐵路　西綫法德兩軍砲戰激烈</h3>
<p>華沙　據此間觀察家聲稱、德國正以陸空軍全力、攻繫波蘭、林堡之陷落、已使波蘭喪失豐富之麥田與油礦、且使其與各中立國斷絕交通、所餘之交通、唯蘇聯一國、但殊不足恃、經近今之大雨後、地土泥濘、波蘭戰士之命運、乃得轉佳、四郊狀况、允其爲華沙附近一帶殊有利於該城守軍、德國曾調七十師攻擊波蘭、軍事專家現信已有十一師由波蘭調至西境陣錢、或正在運輸中、假定波蘭有兵卅師、則德軍仍佔優勢、至在西境進攻、欲獲勝利、則至少須佔三對一之優勢而後可、薩爾白魯根煤礦現於德方、已成無用、蓋法砲隊已控制通至該地之各路也、諸觀察家又謂、此次英軍運至法國、大足表現其軍事技能、因英軍所携機械的配備、共重量至少較上决大戰時任何同數軍隊大三十倍、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據雙方最近戰報觀之、波軍與德軍之劇戰、正在進行中、爭奪華沙西北二十哩歷史上有名之穆特林要塞、德方昨夜廣播消息、調拿破崙所築之穆特林要塞已被德軍攻陷、同時發出之波方消息則謂、德軍向該要塞進攻、已被擊潰、惟承認華沙以東迦魯辛四周之波軍、因德方機械化部隊之壓力、現漸向後撤退、德軍之在安諾波爾附近者、有業已渡過維斯吐拉河之說、今晨華沙市長廣播、謂應微保衛華沙者至爲踴躍、以期退止敵軍之前進、使華沙爲戰爭中之轉捩點云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　德軍部今日宜佈、德軍對包圍古特諾附近之波軍數師、施行總攻擊、抄擊華沙之計畫已完成、另有德軍由西北向穆特林要塞進逼（十四日海通）</p>

<h3>眞理報論　波蘭現局　軍事失敗主因　在於國內矛盾</h3>
<p>莫斯科　眞理報今著評、分析此决波蘭軍事失敗之內幕與眞因、該報云、德波戰事雖僅進行十日、吾人已可謂波蘭已蒙受軍事上之失敗、此項失敗、幾使波方失去所有政治與經濟中心點、吾人殊難信任此種失敗、純係由於德方軍事技術及組織之優越以及英法之未能予波以有效之援助、在德波戰事中、吾人未能覓得事實、證明波軍確曾予德軍以堅强之抵抗或波軍之任何局部勝利、所有關於波蘭局勢之報吿、均露示整個波蘭政權已逐漸陷於瓦解、此項報吿已證明波蘭之懦弱無能、在初步軍事失敗後、即已一蹶不振、然則波蘭之瀕於破產、其眞因果何在乎、首先此項失敗之眞因、係種於波蘭內部之懦弱及矛盾、查波蘭係一含有無數民族之國家、純粹之波蘭人民、僅佔波蘭全部人口百份之六十、其餘百份之四十係由少數民族（大半係烏克蘭·白俄羅斯·猶太）所組成、寓居波蘭之烏克蘭人不在八百萬下、而白俄羅斯人亦有三百萬之多、此兩大少數民族共計一千一百萬人、爲使各方面明瞭波蘭國內烏克蘭及白俄羅斯人地位之重要起見、吾人應指出此兩大少數民族之人口、已超過芬蘭、愛沙尼亞·拉得維亞及立陶宛之共同人口、由此觀之、波蘭當局應即與此重耍之少數民族增强關係、應爲彼等維持權益、應給予彼等以行政自主、並應爲彼等設立學校及其他文化機關、苟一個政府未能以上項權利給予少數民族、其不能堅固內部團結及國家力量、固顯而易見、波蘭統治階級事實上已未能善用此點、且亦未企圖依此而鞏固包含許多少數民族之國家力量、相反的、波蘭統治人物竟盡其能事、使彼等與少數民族關係愈趨惡化、波蘭統治階級之政策、係壓迫少數民族、允其是烏克蘭與白俄羅斯、在烏克蘭西部及白俄羅斯西部、人民慘遭波蘭地主之剝削、彼等非特橫遭壓迫、且已被剝奪一切權利、波蘭之統治階級一方面雖自誇彼等酷愛自由、但事實上已盡其能事將烏克蘭及白俄羅斯西部易爲殖民地、該處人民之權利、全被剝奪、關於此點、波蘭之政策與帝俄時代所採取之政策完全相同、波蘭統治階級已實施彼等政策、迫使烏克蘭及白俄羅斯成爲波蘭化、烏克蘭及白俄羅斯西部現已成爲波蘭軍事殖民地人員之領土、該處波人雖居少數、但已掌握大權關於語言亦已波蘭化、所有官員、均為波人、彼等除波蘭語言外、絕不承認其他語言、凡非波蘭人民、均不得佔政府職位、波蘭當局統治少數民族之方法如下、（一）征討、（二）軍事裁判、（三）白色恐怖、（四）煽動少數民族內部分裂、烏克蘭及白俄羅斯之文化機關、幾已毀滅殆盡、波蘭之意法、非特不予少數民族以自主、且已剝奪彼等攻讀本國文字之權利、此種强迫使烏克蘭及白俄羅斯人波蘭化之手段、非僅施諸學校中、即烏克蘭及白俄羅斯之文學·報章及藝術亦慘遭同樣命運、結果烏克蘭及白俄羅斯之文化已陷於頹廢狀態矣、上述各項均爲波蘭未能及不能使內部團結之眞因事實上、苟波軍與少數民族團結一致、尙可努力阻止對方軍隊之前進也、少數民族未能且亦不能成爲波蘭之可靠後援、此含有許多少數民族之國家、因少數民族被壓迫、而未能團結一致、成爲一有力之軍隊、上述各項均爲波蘭之基本弱點、亦爲此决波蘭軍事失敗之眞因、」（十四日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰爆發前夕　國際新形勢的推移　叔棣　英國誤於狡猾的外交政策　德蘇突然妥協內幕之檢討　日本遭受德國絕對的放棄</h3>
<p>這幾個月來，一直爲夾國大部分開明遠見人士所時時提心吊膽着的事，就是國際形勢的根本上的重行劃分：德·義·西·一集團，獨覇歐洲大陸，被摘去了所有隣邦友邦的法國，祇好專倚靠到海峽這面來，與英國緊密合作，然後再對遠在大西洋彼岸的美國，寄以最大倚仗；遠東的中·蘇·更進一步的携手。而作爲這一切最大前提的呢，毫無疑義的，就是德·蘇間緩術的建立；而依决下來，作爲這一緩衝關係的最大前提，却又毫無疑義的，是德·蘇·之問；由北冰洋起一直到黑海止，這其間所有國家的完全中立化。在所有大家能够想像出的一切與英國不利的國際形勢中，大槪以這一形勢，為最不利的了。可是，在張伯倫現內閣頑强地推行牠獨特路綫下，這却又是必然會演出來的結局。因而，在近幾個月內，他們打擊「張伯倫內閣路錢」的工作，確不能不算是盡了最大的努力。然而，終於因為力量還是不够，不能促成英·法·蘇·軍事同盟的早日成立，而到最後，在張伯倫首相對對德肝協的濃厚空氣中，他們却失望地看到了德·蘇·間建起了緩衝。</p>
<p>「德蘇互不侵犯條的」的宣佈，來得眞像是一個晴天的霹靂。第一個覺得了重大不安的，推想起來，當然是遠東的日本；其次最不安的，當然的就輪到了英·法。</p>
<p>英國這兩天來的緊張與憤慨，當然自不待述。一部分人士，把這歸責於蘇俄的「出賣」英法及「和平陣綫」，另一部分，則把這歸責到德國的「出賣」她自己的盟友日本。而非常奇怪。非常令人刺目的一個現象，就是：竟然有些人，在爲日本對德抱不平，這是從來沒看到過的一個奇蹟。當然那根本，還不過在發洩他們對德·蘇·的忿懣而已。另一些人，則把這認爲是波蘭外長栢克的一手造成的遺誤。但他們大家都有一個難以吐露的隱衷，那是，「張伯倫內閣路綫」的重大錯誤。對這，現在英國的任何人，可以說，都是雪亮的。不過，爲了避免內部的磨擦，應付當前的危機，這兩天來，隨着「德蘇互不侵犯條的」而來的，在英國內部，却是倐然地停止了對張伯倫首相的一切攻訐。除了共產黨的報紙而外，所有的英國報紙和輿論機關，也都一致了他們的論調。換一句話，已經入了一個戰時的狀態。作爲戰時看，這自然是好的；但作爲戰爭未發前的緊急外交措施看，這裏面，還包含着一個非常嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>我們要知道，雖是德·蘇間已經正式簽定了「互不侵犯條的」，但如果她們不能使彼此間所有的國家完全中立化的話，那末，雖是有了這僩條的，緩衝也到底還是一句空話。從北冰洋起一直到黑海止，其間所有各國中，最重要的，當然在目下祇有一個波蘭。在波蘭身上，正繫着英·法·對德·義·今後在歐洲角逐中全盤勝敗的關鍵。波蘭對英法的態度如何呢？記者在以前的一篇通訊裏，已經說過，現在不贅。說到這裏，凡是每一個愛護英國的，在這裏的旁覜者，都不得不爲英國現政府近兩三個月來對波蘭外交運用的錯誤而惋惜。旣然宜佈了同盟，跟着而來的，應常是推誠結納。那末，試問那些以張伯倫首相爲指抓，不斷的對德以犧牲但澤爲志的秘密接洽，以及以財相西門作中堅，一個起勁破壞着對波借款等等的舉動，到底爲的是什麼呢？這樣的情况下，你敢有把握說波蘭不寒心麽？會完全信任英法麽？</p>
<p>所以，我們原先的推想，以爲國會緊急會議召集起來後的英國第一個舉動，應當是改組現政府，加人邱吉爾·艾登·杜夫古栢等，成立擴大的內閣。這，本來早已是英國各方面一致的要求了。而不料昨天的國會第一個舉動，却是反而授予了現內閣以緊急措施的全權。</p>
<p>張伯倫內閣會不會改變牠過去的作風呢？直到這時，德·義·方面，是不是眞能相信英·法·一定起而援助波蘭呢？波蘭方面，是不是完全放心英·法·的援助呢？這一運串的問題，實在是今後歐洲局勢的最大關鍵。在這裏，我還我不到確切的證據，可以加以論斷。不過我的意思，是提醒大家嚴密注意這個生死攸關的處所。</p>
<p>下面，我打算就這個國際新形勢的各方面，予以大概的客觀檢討。</p>
<p>（一）兩個最根本的變動</p>
<p>這幾年來，大家都習慣了於對國際局勢最根本的兩僩說明：一個是，蘇聯方面，爲了阻止「反共十字軍」的組成，她不得不隨時準備和一切反侵略的國家携手，甚至英·法也在內。這就是出自蘇聯的「集體安全」口號之由來。另一個是，德國方面，爲了掩蔽她自己的擴張，她不得不時時以反共和進攻蘇聯爲號召。這就產生了所謂「反共集團。所以，一提到德·蘇·緩衝的可能，往往立刻爲大家所認爲萬難實現。</p>
<p>無論怎樣，蘇·德·的緩衝，是絕不可能的吧？——這樣想着的張伯倫一流入物，於是，就敢於公然地放開手來，一面對德秘密接洽，唆使進攻蘇聯，而同時，又向蘇談判所謂「僅限於歐洲的和平陣綫；」在另一面，却又聯合各國，阻止希特拉的再行擴張，而同時在遠東雖然日蘇已入了半戰爭狀態，英國居然還和日本進行什麼「東京談判」。</p>
<p>早就有人警吿過張伯倫一流人了：這樣子，豈不是促進德·蘇·的緩衝？而這些天來，法國對於這一點，允共一再地送來了警吿。</p>
<p>到底是固執地認為蘇，德，萬難緩衝的這一誤信誤了事。他們祇牢記着「集體安全」口號，和「反共集團」組織產生的當時國際環境，而忽略了近兩三年來國際局勢的因素中幾個最大的變動，而影饗了國際情勢的根本。</p>
<p>第一個，是中國抗戰的成功。第二個，是蘇聯實力的不斷驚人膨大。</p>
<p>中國抗戰的成功，到今天，是毫無容疑的了。除去中國內部有些困難，還需要加以克服外，從國際環境方而看，中國的前向，是一條光明的大道。因此，一切的國家，就不得不針對着這一新的形勢，來考慮牠的全盤外交政策。首先，當然是蘇聯。中國抗戰的局面一經穩定，蘇聯的東西被夾擊的危險，已經完全解除。有着中國這樣一個友邦，坐鎭在牠的東面，對於西面的歐洲一切敵人，牠是進可以攻，退可以守。所以，比起對於一切國際的變動來，對於中國的抗戰，牠是以最大的關心，在注視着的。去年春天，孫哲生特使過倫敦時，曾經說過：「中國單獨可以擊敗日本時，蘇聯不會動作：但萬一中國形勢十分危急，蘇聯一定會毅然向日本夾攻」。這，常然不是沒有根據的話。</p>
<p>德國呢，自從去年召回了在中國的軍事顧問以後，希特拉從他們報告裏，對於中。日，兩方的力量，有了一個很明白的概念。這些軍事顧問們，一致地認爲日本萬難有取勝的希望；相反的，戰綫一天一天地長，時間一天一天地久下去，到最後，中國倒有勝利的一日。那以後，對於日本的陸軍，德國已經失去了帮忙的指望，剩下來的接洽，又一一令德國失了望。所以，日本在「反共集團」裏的價値，從德國方面看，是在一天一天地减小下去。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　滙市平靜　現金轉入常軌</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、局勢寗謐、蓋以外匯趨勢平靜、且多戶有逢高立即獲利了結、及逢小乘低買進之傾向、因之市價上落亦漸入於常軌也、本日差額已不滿百元、情勢則先疲而後轉堅、初因外滙鬆動、引起賣風、且金號與證券帮及散戶等多頭均餃相出籠、致形勢一度頗疲、會退達三千九百七十五元低盤、嗣以業者轉賣爲買、且外匯回平、再以香港帮復託某錢兌業等代進、遂回出四千兀大關、延至午後曾盤高至四千〇六十五元頂價、入後因某金號代富商塞出、兼散戶亦獲利了結、遂回挫至四千零四卞元收盤、結果又漲起十元、交易頗暢、的二千數百兩、銀樓飾金、先跌後回、海關金與中英純金等仍一致無變、</p>
<p>當日上落不及百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開市勢略軟、首山余號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千〇二十元、較之前收做低十元、開後某錢兌業等吸胃尙佳、逐步抬起十五元、某錢兌業進現金號及同業共三十兩、爲四千〇三十五元、時聞外匯報硬、致頓引起散戶賣風、加之某金號（代投機商）及證券帮（代本地帮）多頭亦競相出籠、急轉下瀉、降落五十五元、證劵帮與銀樓帮塞予現金號共四十兩、爲三千九百七十五元、此後某金號突來反出爲進、市象頓轉穩定、立回高至三千九百九十元光景、其時港帮突興買風、力託某錢兌業等代進、致市勢更堅、立衝出四千元大關、某錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千〇十元、後另一錢兌業力塞百餘兩、一度又回落至三千九百九十五元、十一時二十分、聞外滙回平、且港帮續來羅購、散戶亦進多出少、故價遂上漲、未幾即抬高二十五元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲四千〇二十元、午刻稍回、錢兌業售予　號十兩、爲四千〇十元作午收價、午後初開因某錢兌業代客方塞出、且同時某金號亦來猛撳、致開市硬繳二十元、某錢兌業售予同業三十兩、價爲三千九百九十元、時香港帮復託證券帮等代進、兼銀樓帮亦來吸購、遂飛躍直上、不久即漲起七十五元、銀樓帮進錢兌業十兩、爲四千〇六十五元、此後某金號代當商傾向出籠、漲風頓挫、立回小二十元、某金號售予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇四十五元、後證券帮復進百餘兩、一度高達四千〇五十五元、入後因買方進意轉淡、且散戶多頭了結、致稍回落、金號賣予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇四十元、作晚收價、結果比上日又漲十元、聞收後某金號與某銀號賣予錢兌業共五十兩、價爲四千〇三十八元、全天九十元上落、現全號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>

<p>英鎊雖疲純金不動</p>
<p>十三日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯雖英鎊疲落、但公佈價仍爲八鎊八先令、致中央銀行之各行市價、亦隨之呆定、中國現金收買價仍爲一千三百七十元〇九角、掛牌海關金爲二元七角〇七厘、上海標準標金價亦仍爲一千三百六十六元二角、</p>
<h3>外滙愈穩</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、因美對英滙兌又慘落二分八七五、致局勢晨開即吿英平美緊、中途初因華銀行等續來拋塞、致潛勢曾一度鬆硬、英金計四辦士〇六二五、美滙爲六元六八七五、嗣後西商沙遜、稍來吸收、故午刻即見回平、午後情况更形穩定、毫無變動、結果英平、而美略緊、至本月期貨、趨同一步驟、當日仍甚平庸、交易淸淡、</p>
<p>沙遜尚有收買</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長六八七五、遠期漲六二五、紐的銀價大三七五、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英小二分八七五、對滬未更、對法跌半分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士、美滙六元六二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇六二五、乃英美滙兌軋縮之故、開後趨勢平靜、毫無變動、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、猛長四分、此後華行突來塞予外行麥加利有利現貨英金四辦士〇三一二五及〇六二五、繼又吐予大通某行現貨美滙六元六五六二五及六八七五、時英行有利忽復吐予某行現貨美滙六元六八七五、是以爲狀帶硬、迨至十一時許、西商沙遜突來扒進外行華比等現貨英金四辦士〇三一二五及〇一五六二五、並結進某行現貨美滙六元六五六二五及六二五、故市勢回平、迨至午收、銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士、美滙六元六二五、均與晨開相同、</p>
<p>結果英平美緊</p>
<p>後市成交突稀、英滙僅外行互做現貨價四辦士〇一五六二五、美滙亦祇外行賣予華僑現貨價六元六二五、市况極形沉寂、價亦鮮榮辱可言、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士、美滙六元六二五、本月份英金三辦士九六八七五、美滙六元五六二五、結果比上日現期、英平美均微緊〇六二五、</p>

<h3>日金票跌風仍熾</h3>
<p>昨日外幣以滙市頗爲寗靜、金價進退於四千元內外、故亦無甚波動、惟日金票跌風仍熾、初尙平穩、價仍堅站於一元三角二分左右、旋以供塞不絕、乃步退至一元三角九分四五厘、結果軋小二分五六厘、朝鮮票以流通額較少、價則續升一分、計爲一元一角八分、美金票一度降至十四元八角半後、旋又回至十四元九角半、結果毫無軒輊、香港票曾做三元六角四分、卒爲三元六角二分、比上日尙跌一分、法郞票已回起五厘、英金票亦漲五角、其餘均無變動、</p>

<h3>證劵　內債沉靜　橡皮股創新高價</h3>
<p>債市人心觀望、賣買愈淸、多方多數待機而動、空方則仍有拋售、零星散戶、得利稍有補進、故市價毫無伸縮、上下午市價、升沉亦祗五分而已、整個市價、高低相差於五分一角之間、下午收盤後、市上忽有謠言、丙種暗中已破入三元關、計全日結果、高低互見、丁種小二角爲最巨、成交總數、不過三十餘萬元、茲列表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　實銷澹泊　投機商售出現紗　再拖棧單</h3>

<p>現棉交易、聞外棉消費佔多數、蓋以本棉雖在新貨登塲之際、然各路來源阻碍、惟通州花到貨暢健外、其他之稀少、猶似麟鳳、華棉生意突見减色、至廠方鑒於潮流如斯、對於外棉搜羅不絕、查華北天津恒源北洋兩廠、亦在上海辦棉北運、如此狀况、棉市允挺、行情因之再漲五六元不等、蘇北來棉計一千〇五十包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來更形熱閙、售價趨新高峯、殊使各方俱爲驚異不止、然按照此種棉價之走勢、繼續看漲、蓋因各同業之手貨、業將吿罄、因之售價奇緊、巴西棉曾見二百三十元之新高價、白洛區將近一百七十元、西印度的一百八十餘元、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價續昂　特錫粳高價　達四十四元</h3>
<p>柱米　河下仍無到貨、推聞途貨有十五載即將到滬、各地車輪包子的到三千餘包、人心續昂、本街銷塲頗佳、客販一律喊高結果厚粳以貨價已高、略增半元、各尖則續升一元左右、若特錫粳開四十四元、高四十二三元、次之四十元、蘇同崑粳四十二元至四十元、河下早晚稻乏貨無市、原包高價開四十元、决之三十八元、變元去路頗佳、亦增一元之譜、無錫等貨開三十六元、香港糯亦開三十六元至三十五元半、新尖江北貨開二十七元四角至二十六元七角、陳蕪尖二十七元、新尖二十七元、嘉興崑山等新羊尖、二十八元至二十七元半、統計成交數不下七八千包、</p>
<p>客秈　前日漲而復平後、昨日開市被阻米船仍未放行、且傳新到之江北新秈二千包又遭阻留虹口、市上人心頓時向上、米店零戶納胃極貪、新陳客秈售價激漲元許、後市仍居挺俏、昨京高秈已至二十九元、江北秈二十七元半至二十六元、蕪秈二十七元三四角至二十五元四五角云、</p>
<h3>麵粉客銷减退　小麥連日有到</h3>
<p>現粉市况、續吿平站、廠盤仍爲七元二角現鈔、乃係本街零批價格、而回籠貨則受日商廉價傾銷影響、較前又見鬆疲、大致七元三角五六分至四角、聞日廠貨、僅售六元七八角、且能出口、故一部份客帮頗有購取、而本廠粉前途、不免受其打擊矣、昨南北帮客銷略見减退、囤戶則稍有拉進、洋粉以產價頻昂、申市已到八元之價、市塲情形、每多參差云、十五日有粉一萬六千五百包運天津、</p>
<p>小麥來源仍湧、到貨的有三萬包左右、滁州烏衣等處、連日均有裝到、此皆價高招遠貨之故也、各廠進胃、漸形怠懈、業外囤戶、亦鮮問津、惟執貨者售意仍堅、故市面尙形平定、統市售開無錫·丹陽·常州·蘇州·滁州·管店·大塲·揚州·蕪湖等麥共一萬四千餘包、除福阜兩廠辦去一萬三千包外、其餘悉由囤戶辦去、價與前市無軒輊、</p>
<p>豆子十四日自北沙來三百五十包、十五日運天津四千包、又十四日有生油五百件自靑島來、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價後市回緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電、即裝粗白價小〇·四五、爲荷盾九·一五、本市公會劃盤、因囤戶仍有吐出、初市甚弱、現貨會降三元、本棧貨爲五十七元、後轉好回至五十八元三角、外棧初爲五十六元至七元、旋回升五十七元半至八元半、結果比前日僅小五角、轉口小二元至一元、爲四十五六元、太古車白跌二元半至一元半、B嘜爲六十二元半至六十三元半、後市出戶漸稀、有回緊象、H嘜車赤四十五元半至六元、荷亦現貨四十七元半至八元、轉口四十元、本綿白小二元、振記一號爲五十八元、二號五十七元半、三號五十七元、四號五十六元半、本一號冰小一元、爲六十七元半、晶明冰六十九元、國糖海南赤因某方統制、號方特高貨身包俱佳奢確有收進、正綿赤號盤呌六十元、行方划過五十七元半、據建帮消息、漳州及鼓浪嶼間之交通不日可通、如是則刁靑下週或有運到云、</p>
<h3>海味　赤玉參獻新　開價奇昂</h3>
<p>赤玉參初决見新、因成本甚高、故號方開盤價格奇昂、玉參比春季須漲七八十元之多、茲將各檔價詳情、刋市價欄、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢羢有漲無跌</h3>
<p>呢羢毛織物、目下勿論男女色料、一致上漲、賣方執存者、莫不居爲奇貨、蓋外洋貨爲外匯揭價血本漲高、此後到貨益稀、本廠貨申織品、如怡和寅豐章華等各牌、廠價俱超過現市沽價、觀新近各種呢羢貨品、大有今天開出明天補不進之患、因之隨造成各貨之有漲無跌、冬季需銷之大衣呢、市氣格外俏漲云、</p>
<h3>八月份漲價統計</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>八月份的漲價、仍是接承外匯緊縮後繼續未已、抑且其漲率、是很迅速的提高、竟有驟增至一倍者、無疑地、物價的這樣漫無止境上漲、誰也不會吾認是摧毀購買力的减縮、這裏單就八月份的報章上刋登漲價通吿來統計一下、</p>

<h3>日召集各國駐軍會議　圖變更外軍防區　各國司令均無意見發表　美赫德大將已兼程回滬</h3>
<p>昨日上午十時三十分、駐滬日本海軍當局、突在虹口陸戰隊本部、邀英·美·意·三國駐滬防軍司令、舉行會議、到會者有英陸軍少將西蒙司·萬國商團司令洪貝·美陸軍少校費根·意海軍少校維伐爾、被邀列席者、有工部局總辦費利浦·總巡鮑恩。及法軍代表一人、日方出席者、爲駐滬海軍長官。上海警備司令櫻井、會議至十二時始散、西報記者曾向日海軍發言人探詢會議內容、發言人稱、「奉令不得將開會原因洩露」、但稱此會「甚爲重要」、經大中社記者探悉、昨晨所召集之會議、係討論調整滬上各國駐軍防地、故工部局總辦總巡及法軍代表、亦被邀請列席、但事前各國防軍司令、與日方並無接洽、席間日方建議調整上海租界防區、某外國防軍司令會質問將加以如何之調整、當時日方並無肯定之答覆、僅謂具體調防計劃、將於數日後提出書面、送達各國防軍司令、據外人方面消息、當時日方即提一簡單而機密之方案、內容之一、與蘇州河以北英軍防區最有關係、</p>
<p>召集會議提出計劃</p>
<p>美聯社十四日本市消息、日本駐滬海軍當局、今日召集本市英義美防軍司令官會議、討論修改現行公共租界防務計劃之問題、法國駐滬軍事當局亦派員列席旁聽、在會議中日方之意、以爲現行公共租界之防務計劃、爲一九三一年所草擬者、一九三四年曾修正一次、此項計劃、乃所以防華方不利於租界之行動、至於目今此項威脅、業爲日本解除、則此項防務計劃、當然不適於用、請各國司令發表意見、嗣以各國司令皆無建議揚出、日方即宣布休會片刻、</p>
<p>赫德上將今日來滬</p>
<p>但休會後、各方仍無建議提出、於是日方祗得宜吿閉會、惟各司令官臨行時、表示此一問題不妨討論一下、惟重行集會之日期、則現尙未定、又訊、美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德海軍上將、已突然離靑準於明日（即今日）來滬、恐與日方今晨此項建議有關、</p>
<h3>日方所傳二項結論</h3>
<p>又據昨午日本駐滬海軍發言人聲稱、今晨駐滬各國司令官會議、已得有二項結果、（一）各方一致同意、現行公共租界之防務計劃、有修正之必要、（二）各方同意由日本海軍陸戰隊草擬公共租界防務計劃之修正草案、以作他日各方討論之基礎、據該發言人言、日方並無要求、亦無具體建議、欲待討論者爲防務上之原則問題、</p>
<p>英美意將會商對策</p>
<p>據另一報吿、日本海軍咋日召開上海防軍司令會議時、日海軍代表起立發表召開會議之動機云、「上海防軍分佈計劃、起草於一九三一年、修正於一九三四年、茲因上海環境已有改變、該項計劃、自當予以修正、蓋防軍計劃之成立、由於預防中國方面之侵入租界、今已由日軍除去此種威脅、故當重行討論修正方案矣、」至於此後將加以如何調整、日方當時並未立即提出、但請到會各國司令官提出建議、但各代表毫無表示、日軍乃宣吿休息、俄頃以後、重行開會、各代表依然毫無意見提出、惟英軍領袖承認修正防軍計劃、係屬可能而已、乃宣吿閉會、當休息時、英美意三國防軍領袖間、會交換意見、同意由各國駐軍參謀開會討論、以覓取修正防軍計劃之方案、第一决參謀聯席會議日期、尙未決定、日軍聞訊、曾要求參加該項會議、公開討論、外國防軍領袖表示、一俟各國防軍參謀、議有成案、然後與日方繼續討論、</p>
<p>赫德來滬各方重視</p>
<p>美國亞洲艦隊總司令赫德大將由滬返靑島、尙未多日、突叉於昨日乘快艦伊薩培爾號兼程來滬、預定今日可到、此舉以出人意外、頗爲各方所重視、蓋赫德大將本定於本月底始乘旗艦奧古斯太號來滬、今已接滬上去電、故有此行也？</p>
<p>滬西交涉毫無進展</p>
<p>據可靠消息、關於越界築路交涉、述日工部局與日領館在不斷進行中、惟毫無進展、聞交涉之一方、爲工部局警務處、一方爲日領、交涉內容、當局嚴守秘密、暫不允發表、工部局總董樊克令、巳於昨晨由北戴河趕返上海、即赴工部局消假辦公、想係因上海局勢嚴重、急待其返滬主持應付也、</p>
<p>英美密切合作應付</p>
<p>據熟悉工部局情形之工商界領袖某氏、昨晤大中社記者云、租界問題之重心、現集中於美國、以英法方有事於歐洲、美國遂操上海租界地位之決定權、其一舉一動、誠可左右一切、當此日軍以武力開始向租界進攻之際、美總統羅斯福。及國務卿赫爾、於招待記者席上發表聲明、「反對以武力改變遠東之地位」、共意向何如、不言可喩、現悉英美兩國之領事對越界築路交涉、正保持密切接觸、迭有接洽、足證兩國在滬當局已決心合作、應付此種局勢矣、最可訾議者、歷來關於此項越界築路問題、交涉最爲繁複、當吳鐵城任市長時代、其秘書長兪鴻鈞與工部局前總裁費信惇、迭决交涉之結果、本巳瀕於解決、如越界築路之警權與租稅、其時即已擬有具體辦法、但以工部局缺乏誠意、致我方功虧一簣、曩時工部局旣遷延不以越界築路之警權交還中國政府、今則與日方開始交涉、擬對世界各國所未經承認之僞政府表示讓步、恐在英國外交史上、將從此又增一污點也、</p>
<p>滬西情形時張時弛</p>
<p>大中社記者曾於昨晚再赴滬西一帶巡視一週、茲記詳情於後</p>
<p>補防從未加以干涉</p>
<p>海格路四四八號巨厦、（地豐路西首）自前日（十三）被日憲兵僞警侵佔後、屋主林氏眷屬、已於昨日全部遷出、大門前仍由僞警四人駐守、並在大門西首、另闢一門、較原來之大門更爲寬闊、現正由日僞警十餘人、加緊趕造中、測共用意、或供日憲兵守望之用、對於日僞警此種行動、捕房方面、尙未聞有何種應付方法、</p>
<p>日本軍官佔用民房</p>
<p>極司非而路十一號慈聯分會第三十一收容所、前仍有僞警四人駐守、而內部留駐之日僞警、昨日巳大部他調、祗留有十餘人、昨日中午有日軍官一名、擅自將該所主任寢室開啟、即在房中進餐、是時適主任之妻自外婦來、疑係服役難民、擅自開啟、面加斥責、聲爲日軍官所聞、頓時大怒、擬即將該主任等逐出、現正在交涉中、</p>
<p>愚園路上英軍放哨</p>
<p>靜安寺路一七六〇號上海商業儲蓄銀行職員宿舍門首、仍由偽警六人駐守、往來之日憲兵及僞警、則仍頻繁、但無何項變化、至愚園路四明別墅，中實新村。及漁光村對面之錢家巷等處、各有僞警二名、分駐出入口、形勢與前日相同、惟近兆豐公園附近、便衣僞警時去查詢住戶姓名人口等事、但尙無其他不幸事件發生、七六九號巨厦間首有英軍二名、荷槍駐防、頗引行人注目、</p>
<p>偽警業已撤走一部</p>
<p>康家橋金家巷口仍有僞警布崗駐守、惟在康家橋金司徒廟一帶之駐守偽警察、則已撤退、而馬路橋（開納路口）日憲西區司令部門首之堡壘、昨日仍在建築中、偽警分署門首之沙袋、昨日則在改建中、上面並加蓋凉棚、</p>
<p>架設電話武裝巡邏</p>
<p>曹家渡方面、沿勞勃生路一帶、日工兵乘軍用卡車、就原有電桿上架設軍用電話、甚形忙碌、而日憲兵及僞警乘均用卡車來往、亦較為頻繁、各馬路仍有偽警武裝列隊巡邏、維對居民之自由、尚未見有所侵犯、</p>
<h3>日方各種行動　均諉諸『自衛』　竟稱每一條約俱合自衛　對美國聲明謂不予重視</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日方昨日（十三日）招待新聞記者時、或問、今是吾有任何徵象、表示日本將在此間採取其在九國公的中所要求之自衛辦法、日大使館發言人答稱、此點悉視將來發展而定、</p>
<p>不能預知事件之來</p>
<p>發言人繼乃對論美國務卿赫爾所稱美國對於任何片面的企圖用武力取消美國在中國與遠東之權利、必加反對一節稱、目前不能言定、日後此間將發生何種事件、此項問題、與國際公法、頗咨牽涉、但每一條的均包含有關各方採取自衛辦法之權、</p>
<p>赫爾言論不予重視</p>
<p>滿洲一事變」、日本援引此種權力、即其著者、目前之中國「事變」亦然、日當局今對赫爾言論、不予重視、因美國自滿洲「事變」來、即抱此種態度、美國不承認「滿洲國」、即遵從其不承認他國用武力片面的更變任何條的之立塲也、自衛權爲美國一般主要法學家所承認者、如最高法院首席法官許士且信自衛權「較條的本身爲强」云、</p>
<p>緊張局勢含糊其詞</p>
<p>或問日方是吾感覺美國於此時重申前言有何理由、大使館發言人答稱、美當局或認上海與遠東一般局勢甚爲緊張之故、或問、發言人亦以爲上海局勢「甚緊張」乎、發言人作含糊共辭之答覆稱、此純屬程度的問題、而凡人對於緊張之程度、意見各殊、</p>
<p>日方政策各個談判</p>
<p>關於運用一片面的」一詞、發言人稱、日政府確定態度、不與他國從事討論或商榷以解決與中國有關之各種問題、近如天津問題、僅由英日雙方討論、以其牽涉英國故也、日政府嚴守僅與有關此問題的英國討論之政策、發言人復述及九國公的、力稱、自衛權之意、非在取銷、而在修正、凱洛格。白萊安。公的規定有關各國有自衛之權、日本訴諸「自衛辦法」、並不與該的相牴牾、</p>
<h3>德僑商未受歧視</h3>
<p>德國利克茂輪船公司上海分公司、因歐戰發生、往來於德國遠東間之船隻、完全停駛、營業一蹶不振、兼以上海房租昂貴、爲縮小範圍、節省開支起見、爰於昨日由原址法租界愛多亞路九號、遷至公共租界六二〇號、外傳該公司此决搬塲、係因受法租界方面友誼之勸吿、德領　咋對大中社記者聲明、此說不確據稱法租界方面從未有勸吿德僑商遷出法租界之事、</p>
<h3>交戰國航輪煙囪　改漆黑色</h3>
<p>自歐洲第二决大戰發生後、交戰國航輪、均受本國海軍部指揮、本市英商怡和洋行。太古公司各輪、曾一度爲海軍部阻止航行、隔日即恢復、惟各輪二舷之中英文銅木質之船名及旗幟、均皆塗沒、近又聞怡和洋行各輪煙囪係紅色、現亦改漆黑色、藍烟囱公司之各輪烟囱藍色、亦將改漆黑色、至太古公司各輪烟囱、本係黑色、不知將來是否更改、</p>

<h3>太平洋　又起颶風　距滬尙速趨向未明　浦江今日起發高潮</h3>
<p>據天文台消息、太平洋上又發生一新颶風、惟目前離滬尙遠、故其所抵方位及趨向均未明、又本埠今晨零時問、浦江發潮頗高、今日午後仍有高潮、須綿續至二十日始趨平復、高潮期內低窪馬路之商店行棧、對於防汎工事、母得鬆懈、致遭損失、</p>
<h3>總巡鮑恩否認　專用日人之說　有能力者均可充任要職　其人國籍爲何在所不問</h3>
<p>大陸報云、工部局警務處總巡鮑恩、昨日（十三日）午後吾認日文「大陸新報」所傳渠會稱擬招「幹練日人」以補英人遺缺、而不擬僱他國人一說、惟稱該報其餘所載屬實、查「大陸新報」載稱、該報訪員星期二日訪鮑氏、叩以警務處英日籍警務人員事、鮑氏答稱、對於日人、並無故意之歧視、任何人具有適宜辦理其職務之能力者、即可任要職、而不問其人之國籍、</p>
<p>警務處遵局方意見</p>
<p>對於准英捕用手提機關槍而禁日捕使用之規例、渠認爲並非歧視、此非岐視而係手續之問題、現擬訓練日捕使用此等槍械、該報訪員問關於「市府」當局要求管理界外馬路、警務處將取何種態度、鮑氏稱、此問題至爲重要、渠不能遽即答覆、警務處之態度、將視工部局之決定、非視渠個人意見而定、警務處遵照工部局確定之政策、責當保持西區界外馬路之警務權、</p>
<p>希望日人共同合作</p>
<p>鮑氏又稱、渠對公共租界拘留營中四行孤軍之維持費、以及英當局攫佔公共租界中德人財產事、均無所知、公共租界之和平與秩序、應予維持、此爲構成租界的各國之共同責任、鑒於目前歐洲在「黑暗局面」中、渠希望日方積極合作、以維持公共租界之和平與秩序、工部局中並未發現英日雙方之摩擦、百事似均在順利進行中、渠並希望英日對於影響及公共租界之一般問題、互相合作、</p>
<h3>歐洲雖起大戰　援華捐款不减　下月可望各國踴躍捐輸　各地水災難民亟待援手</h3>
<p>大陸報云、記者昨（十三日）晤久已從事救濟工作者數人、據彼等意見、歐洲雖起大戰、下月中仍可望各國不斷作經濟上援助、俾在中國全境進行救濟工作、彼等對於一般人所信歐洲復起戰事、捐助之救濟基金、行將天减、幾均不予置信、據指稱、數團體刻正加倍努力、捐募款項、以充在華救濟工作費用、此等團體之一、爲美國敎會委員會、該會去歲會募得在華救濟基金美金二十五萬元以上、刻正進行募捐美金百萬元運動、以充來歲救濟之用、據美國在華救濟基金委員會某員聲稱、縱來自英國之基金、亦不致完全停頓、該委員會近與英國辦公處通訊所悉、使會方相信英倫與自治領可望繼續捐助</p>

<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>影劇觀感及其他（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>—銀星陸露明小姐口述—</p>
<p>編者介紹：陸露明雅稱「健美明星」，洰於舞臺劇與電影藝術，致力年久，兩不偏廢，志極可嘉。年來譽溢藝壇，舞臺銀幕，並著芳聲；早見卓爾不羣，有其優良成就；顧猶虚懷若谷，奮進不遑。藝人風度如此，前途洵有未可限量者。</p>
<p>我是一個電影與戲劇的深切愛好者，六年前從北方到上海，投身影劇界以來，舞臺劇與電影雖已演過了不少，至今却仍自認爲是一位渺小的學員，對於日常的演戲工作，很努力很小心地只圖一意上進，假此多得機會訓練自己。我的唯一目的成就，能够成功一位真正的演員。</p>
<p>身世述略</p>
<p>我的原籍是廣東省，不…………過從小却在瀋陽生長的；因爲我的父親是位建築工程師，一向就在那裏執行業務，直到九歳那年移居天津，亦經住上十年之久。這時期，我在當地一所名呌「聖功」的教會學堂裏讀書多年，而父親則是很不幸的在我十五歳時，他就抛却我們母女倆溘然謝世了！</p>
<p>從影舊事</p>
<p>想起從影舊事，算來不覺快近十年了。記得是民十九年，聯華公司在北平開辦第五分廠，招考演員。當時，自己在醉心電影的一片熱忱下欣欣然趕去投考；結果幸被錄取，就在他們的訓練所中開始受教。該所主持人爲前輩戲劇家侯曜先生，男女學員計有一百多位；如白楊女士（時名楊君莉）劉莉影女士以及大胖子殷秀岑先生等，都是彼時間濟濟一堂的同學。訓練期定爲六個月，當下一面排日上課，一面更如實習般的忙着拍演一部名呌「故宫新怨」的影片。現在想起來真可笑：這片子金屬外景，從頭至尾內影是一塲没有的，——因爲除有一架開麥拉場外，根本上便没其他的設備。每天一夥人在萬壽山那裏烈日之下，往來拍演，面部上大家塗上厚厚的油彩，鎭日間晒得皮膚發痛委實可憐。「拍影戲就是這樣的事嗎？」實在連得攝影塲與燈光亦從没見過，大家只在莫明其妙的加勁從事而已。後來，六個月修業期滿，「故宫新怨」同時拍演告竣，聯華第五廠亦即宣布結束，就此雲散風流，歸於解體。</p>
<h3>「中電」又一新片「中華兒女」全部攝竣</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>—不日在渝首先放映</p>
<p>（重慶通訊）中央電影塲自遷至重慶後，爲了材料運輸的困難，請購外滙的不便，以及氣候的多雨多霧，有礙於拍攝外景，而拍攝中的幾部新片，多不能如期告成。</p>

<h3>滬光換映「航空英雄」</h3>
<p>—又一部蘇聯新片</p>
<p>蘇聯的元老導演，現在很少新作問世，原因是他們擔負起了訓練和指導新導演的任務。例如愛克，愛森斯坦，普陀甫金等的作品，最近都很少見。即使製作什麽新片，他們也必用助導，以便給後起者學習的機會。普陀甫金的新作「航空英雄」，便是另用陀列爾爲助導的。</p>
<p>滬光原定開映的續「彼得大帝」，聽説因故暫行緩映，自本月十六日起先行開映普氏的「航空英雄」。這部片子是顯示蘇聯空軍的强大，政府對於航空事業的注意。</p>
<p>史太林和莫洛托夫等也在這片子裏擔任了一個角色；他們在歡迎會裏和飛英雄們一一握手。</p>
<p>這片子的主題，在另一方面還説明：偉業是普通人做出的，偉人是平凡人所養成的。</p>
<p>辣斐劇塲繼「日出」後的「野」，又逢租界特别戒嚴，故擬自十六日起，祗演日塲，夜塲停演云。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>王克琴與張勳離合之經過</p>
<p>張勳見他部下如此齊心，全部捨不掉這條滿淸時留下來的大辮子，（張部兵士，一律皆係鬆長大辮，平時以黑紗包頭。）就知道他們全與自己表同情的，因此他才毅然放膽北行。但是當他决意率領全軍離徐的當兒，張文生深恐老師此去上當，遂再一勸阻勿行，不可涉險行事，焉想有個催命鬼康聖人把辮帥説得心服口服，覺得有這樣大才學的人運籌帷幄，還會上了人家的當麽？故而他理也不理，就帶着全體官佐出了徐州東門登上火車啦。張文生見他去志已决，無可挽回，乃自請留守徐海等處，並力請分兵一半歸其統帶以固根本重地，誰知張仍不聽，一面與文生互駡，一面亟命火車升火。這時文生見無法可施，遂横臥車頭前之路軌上，阻其開駛，並痛哭流涕，力請將兵卒留徐一半，他人挽之不起，辮帥親來拖之，亦不少動。兩人且駡且拖，糾纒不已。後來還是允了文生的請求，命他同白寳山兩人各以鎭守使名義分守徐海兩城，分兵一半予之，這樣辮帥才得啟行。後來雖是復辟失敗，辮帥逃入東交民巷荷蘭使館，然而政府當局因爲徐海還有他的舊部駐守，所以不敢公然把他同他的安武軍全部解决，過後先把張文生升了皖督，調離徐州，又命陳調元用迅害不及掩耳的手段，夤夜將陳德修統率的歩隊繳了械，比較精鋭的歸陳氏改編，並由陳繼任徐入鎭守使。如此一來，煊嚇一時的辮兵，才都剪了辮子，消滅於無形，可見張文生不但是辮帥的駡友，而且還是他的大功臣呢。（一○一）</p>

<h3>讓大家吃吃飯</h3>
<p>— 柳浪</p>
<p>讀了美國賑濟中國難民聯合會主席羅斯福氏之第二决「一碗飯」運動的宣言，百感俱集，有不得不說的話要吐出來。</p>
<p>美國人為了拯救我們中國的難民，不惜自己少吃一碗飯。然而回顧上海，那些富有者非但不肯吃一碗鈑，而且把許多人的飯搶來給自己一個人吃。白米儘管源源來滬，米價還是上昇不已。許多人早已被迫放去飯碗，來動手做一向吃不慣的麵粉。可是麵粉價格也隨之而高漲了，於是許多又被迫淪為難民。我們想像得到富有者的肚皮吃得格外高了，而　民則越來越飢饉瘦弱。我們彷彿看見富有者張大血口吮吸貧民的血液，我們彷彿看見滿街躺着飢餓的人們。</p>
<p>在羅氏的宜言中，還注意到了醫藥對難民的重要。怎麼不呢？住在花園洋房裏的少爺奶奶們尙且時常要感到腰酸背痛，常服上好補　；那麽侷促於似同黑地獄的　民收容中的難民，疾病叢生，自然是意料中事。本來，難　收容所因為經費困難，對於難民們的小毛病，祗能馬虎一點。自然，由小恙而到大病，由大病而一命嗚呼，也是常有的事，不過「經濟困難」究竟「情有可原」。而現在呢？歐洲戰事爆發，富有者以第一次歐戰發財機會重臨，莫不爭相購買洋貨，而於西藥一項獨多，因為生病吃藥乃必然的事情，即使藥價飛漲，也不怕病人不買，獲利自可毫無問題。所以西藥存貨雖然充足，而囤積居奇，有些藥品即出高價也不易辦到。這在富有者自身，儘有餘錢買藥吃，自然無用介意。而中下階以下，就感到生病之大不易；落到難民頭上，那祗有坐以待斃了</p>
<p>至於藉口救濟難民，從中盤剝漁利，也是數見不鮮的。而看看羅斯福所發起的「一碗飯」運動宣言：『此次「一碗飯」運動所得掃數作中國難民之用，本會辦公費不在捐款項下支出」，這與我們的大善土為安揷親友而組織救難團體，虛報實銷，掛名支薪，豈能同日而語！</p>
<p>這些現象雖然五光十色，但歸納起來却祗有一點：富有者討厭着貧民！原因很簡單，貧民非但於他沒有好處，而且還於他們有害（如强盜綁票之妨害他們的自由）。所以，難民（或貧民）的死是活該！死光了，可以讓他們安居樂業。至於那些貧民是吾因為遭他們剝削而貧，或是貧民死光以後，他們是吾還可以獲得廉價的勞力，和他的出產品是否有廣大的出路，他們就不耐煩去想了一有人看見了羅斯福氏第二决「一碗飯」運動，一定也想來響應一下；其實是大可不必的。第一，在這樣混亂的時期中，差不多的人家，連自己吃釵也成問題，呌他們怎樣少吃。第二，富有者不願少吃。第三，凡成立一個會，反而多一筆新的開支、</p>
<p>乾脆一點，還是求求富有的老爺們，別搶別人的飯吃，　大家吃吃飯！</p>

<h3>電燈（機械詩話）</h3>
<p>— 如晦</p>
<p>因着整理舊報，無意中在光緒八年（一八八二）九月三十日的「申報」上，發現了一條新聞，題目呌做「禁止電燈」，內容說本埠點用電燈，經道憲邵觀察扎飭英會審員陳太守，查明中國商人，點用者共有幾家，稟候核辦、慈悉太守已飭差協同地保，按戶知照。禁止電燈，以免不測。聞各舖戶亦以電燈不適於用，故皆遵諭云。</p>
<p>現在看來，這當然是一件趣事。顧在當時，海禁開放不久，初與西洋文明接觸，中國人對電燈這「怪物」的驚奇與疑慮，也是在可能之中的。</p>
<p>因此，我想起當時一些詠，電燈」的詩。最奇妙的，是載在「字林滬報」附頁「花團錦簇樓詩輯」卷一裏，掃綠山人「申江雜詠」中的一首：電氣為燈奪化工，夜來照得滿街紅，初來遊客驚疑甚，皓月如何在雨中。</p>
<p>初見到電燈的人，遠遠地看，以為是一輪皓月，然以其在雨中也，叉不能無疑，這諷刺是够幽默的。這正如後來作漫畫的人，盡一個鄉下人，在電燈上點旱煙，一樣的有趣，葉文琴「上海竹枝詞」裏也有一首，其意境和掃綠山人詩相類似：海市分明不夜天，電燈煤氣兩爭妍，敎人不識團　月，漫說今宵是上元。</p>
<p>同時，蘇康侯「滬上新竹枝詞」亦云：勝地無須秉燭行，圓珠替月倍分明，何須浪擲金錢買，海上天開不夜城。</p>
<p>從這三首詩裏，是都可以看到當時的人，是以怎樣的驚奇眼光，看視着「電燈」。但何以如此，却毫無理解，有的祗是驚奇而已。不過。也並非沒有理解的人。這可以看吳榮森「時事三咏」之一的「電燈」：新製銀燈耿碧檠，低涵電氣光瑩瑩，燃花竟燦恒春樹，入室渾同不夜城。（待續）</p>
<h3>苟安在地獄裏的人們</h3>
<p>— 弱者</p>
<p>有一天晚上，歸家將近午夜了。這法租界邊緣一帶的貧民區中，百步之內，已經很少見到昏黯的燈光了。摸進了自已的家，在桌前燃着了洋燭，望着自己的人影映在壁上，我忽然感覺到眞像住在地獄里了。許久平靜了的心底，不禁又泛起了如麻的思潮；但也正如亂麻一樣，千頭萬緒，不知從何理起。忽然窓外傳來了一陣輕微的談話聲，日出而作，日入而息的人們，誰還在浪費着寳貴的睡眠時間呢？</p>
<p>臥室的窓外，是弄堂的底，我從窓隙間向外看去，有二團黑影蜷伏在牆角里。在他們中間，有一支洋燭燃着，借着這微弱的光綫，我看淸楚了他們就是在弄中拾垃圾的　人。但在這深更午夜，他們還有興緻談天，而不知天明以後，他們將不能在這免費住宿舍安眠了呢？同時也竊笑着自己，為什麽也獨自在陋室中徘徊？可是陲魔已經一驅走了，不如燃了支烟，和他們一窓之隔，作長夜之談吧。</p>
<p>靠窓更近了一點，當我看淸楚了他們在幹着什麽的時候，我幾乎眼里冒出血來。——這二個生活都沒有保障的露宿者，他們正對着火燄燃吸着一種烈性的毒物……</p>
<p>『孤島』的四週已被毒的迷霧包圍着，這種軟性的侵略政策正不知殺害了多少人了！租界當局的竭力在肅淸這毒燄的漫延，是値得我們敬佩的，但是不知自愛的人們正在自己投到羅網中去呢。——連這兩個生活都沒有保障的露宿者！</p>
<p>天快亮了，這些茍安在地獄里的人們讓他們在陽光之下毀滅吧！</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　謀與醫學造士成癢癢　思擴存治托兒有所</p>
<p>現在老童醫師，却有一個新企畫。她去年曾經到中國的內地去旅行過，像河南，河北，山東，山西這幾省，她都曾去過。老章醫師是篤信宗敎的人，他們這敎會中人，對於中國內地各處，都有分會，都設立那些敎會性質的醫院。所以老章醫師到內地去，不怕沒有人招待。但是她到那裏去看看，中國內地的衛生設備，實在太差了。地方上的衛生行政，僅在近幾年來稍為有所措置，以前可以說是等於零。雖然內地的敎會中人，也曾辦了幾個慈義性質的醫院，也實在是簡陋得很的。有幾處閉塞的縣份，全不知道什麽呌做衛生。有幾處地方，終年難得見水面，人民也不知道洗浴。有的地方，說是人生一世，只洗兩决祿。第一次是剛生下來的時候，呱呱墮地，洗一次澡；第二次在做親的前夜，也洗一次澡。此外就永無洗澡之日，即使到了死後，也不過揩一次身，）用不着洗澡。果然那個地方的水是名貴的，人民的養成惰性，也是一個理由吧？還有人民的知識痼蔽，也是最大障礙。就把老章醫師所去的內地一個地方說，見到十七八歲的大姑娘，走起路來，還是那種搖搖不定的。再瞧瞧她們的脚。都有一些畸形，原來她們從小都是纏過了的。因想中國的婦女們放脚，也有五十年歷史了，怎麽十七八歲的姑娘們，還有纏過了脚的呢？實在從前的內地，有許多地方，都與外間隔絕。在江浙沿海那些地方，纏脚的姑娘們早已絕跡，而那些風氣閉塞的內地，小姑娘們到五六歲還有纏脚的。最可笑而可歎的，像有些近夷苗的地方，夷苗的女子，倒是跣足游行，並不纏脚。而漢族女子，反多纏足，問其原由，以為漢族高貴，自別於夷苗，所以不能不纏足了。這種愚蒙可笑，一直到丁前五六年，內政部派了許多女職員，到各處內地去考察。凡是一地方十歲以下的女子，還有纏足的人，地方官却有處分，那一家的家長，也有罪名。所有已纏者，强迫一律解放。但是那些女孩子們，可憐已被她愚頑狠心的家長，把她兩脚的脚骨拗折了。雖然解放，走路終有些異樣。（一八二）</p>

<h3>British Implementation of Naval Escorts to Protect Merchant Ships; Intensified Blockade to Ensure Maritime Superiority; Germany Announces Contraband Includes Food and Clothing, Etc.; Submarine Tactics Will Intensify Thereafter</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today the implementation of a naval escort system to counter German submarines, stating that once the escort system is fully implemented, it will prove to be highly effective in determining the outcome of the war. Currently, the British light naval forces are participating in the struggle, and the main goal of the British Navy, as in the previous war, is to ensure freedom and security at sea. The German side has once again violated all the rules of naval warfare in this war, carrying out cruel actions against passenger merchant ships. Several British merchant ships have been sunk, and the losses are, of course, quite significant. This was expected, as when the war broke out, a large number of British merchant ships were scattered on the sea, sailing according to peacetime conditions. Germany had already deployed submarines and supply ships to strategic locations before the war, so it is no wonder that some British ships were attacked or nearly attacked by submarines before they could reach ports. However, we are now rapidly implementing the escort system, and its effectiveness is increasing daily. When the war first broke out, German ships at sea or in neutral or British and French ports, excluding Baltic ports, had a total tonnage of 1,105,000 tons. These ships have now completely disappeared from the high seas. Some have been seized, and most have taken refuge in neutral ports and cannot leave. Furthermore, the British fleet's control over contraband has greatly restricted the transportation of supplies needed by Germany by neutral ships. (Reuter's, 13th)</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon. In addition to reporting on the joint meetings of the British and French Supreme Defense Council, he also announced that the government intends to establish a Merchant Shipping Department. However, in the current situation, it is still advisable to manage shipping temporarily under the Ministry of Commerce. He also stated that three Polish destroyers have been incorporated into the British fleet and are proving to be very effective. British warships are constantly bombarding enemy submarines, and significant progress has been made in eliminating submarines. Recalling the previous European war, our navy did not escort merchant ships until the summer of 1917. By the time of the armistice, a total of 16,500 merchant ships had been escorted, of which only 102 were sunk by submarines. Now that the government has quickly adopted escort measures, there is no reason to say that their effectiveness is less than it was twenty-two years ago. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German government announced last night that the amended contraband regulations of the 12th of this month would be implemented from today. According to an official statement, Germany previously issued contraband regulations on August 28th, stipulating that unconditionally prohibited goods were limited to goods transported to enemy territory and directly used by the enemy's land, sea, and air forces. Now, the British contraband list is far more extensive than this limit, so the German government has no choice but to amend the regulations as well. Article 1 regarding unconditionally prohibited goods should be amended as follows: 1. Various military equipment and parts and components thereof; 2. Various munitions, bombs, torpedoes, mines, sea mines, landmines, and various bullets, shells, launchers, gunpowder, explosives, detonators, etc.; 3. Various warships, parts, and components thereof; 4. Various military aircraft and parts and aircraft engines; 5. Armored vehicles and armored trains; 6. Chemical warfare materials and various launching and explosive mechanisms; 7. Military uniforms and military equipment; 8. Communication and lighting equipment and parts thereof; 9. Transportation equipment and parts; 10. Various motors and heating materials; 11. Gold and silver coins and promissory notes; 12. Various machinery and materials for manufacturing the items stipulated in item 11. The regulations regarding conditionally prohibited goods will now amend Article 24 of August 28, 1939, as follows: Food, luxury goods, feed, clothing, and their production materials that meet the requirements of Article 24 are all contraband. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the German amendment to the contraband regulations, the newspapers here have all written articles commenting on it, believing that it is a response to the British "piratical contraband policy." The newspapers emphasized that the scope of the British-announced contraband list proves that Britain has abandoned all international conventions and reverted to piratical methods. Hereafter, the food and clothing issues of the people of Italy, Spain, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian countries will be directly controlled by Britain. Under these circumstances, Germany has no choice but to amend the contraband regulations, even though it knows that neutral countries will inevitably be affected. However, the matter is a passive one, and there is no alternative. All countries should be able to ascertain who is responsible. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<h3>Complete Halt of German Shipping; Supply of Adjacent Neutral Countries; Britain Demands Neutrality from South American Countries; France Also Pays Attention to the Status of European Countries</h3>
<p>Paris - After the British and French navies implemented a blockade against Germany, the country's shipping has completely stopped. Hereafter, all supplies will have to rely on neighboring neutral countries. Diplomatic pressure has been applied to ensure that neutral countries supply the country with various goods as much as possible. It is reported that the relationship between the Slovak Republic and Hungary has become tense due to this. The Slovak Republic's army has been forced to join the German army in fighting Poland, and Hungary is also deploying troops on the border, refusing to allow German troops to pass through to attack Poland. French diplomatic circles are closely watching this matter and stated that according to international law, neutral countries must not take any measures to assist belligerent countries in increasing their war resources. Therefore, supplying certain contraband goods to belligerent countries is a violation of neutrality. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London - The Information Department has just released a communiqué stating that, "In view of the possibility that the enemy may set up submarine bases on the coasts of Central and South American countries, the British government has instructed its envoys stationed in those countries today to request the governments of the countries in which they are stationed to take all necessary measures to avoid undermining neutrality." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London - The Information Department has just released a communiqué stating that the Dutch ship "Groenlo," carrying a batch of goods to Düsseldorf, Germany, was intercepted by a British warship. Upon investigation, it was confirmed that there were contraband goods on board, and the ship was immediately advised to unload the goods at Downs Port in England. Once the unloading is completed, it will be allowed to proceed. In addition, although several American ships have been inspected by British warships, none have been detained. Among them, the "Black Osprey" was escorted to Weymouth Port by a British warship on the 6th of this month for inspection. However, because the 400-odd items of cargo showed no signs of being transported to Germany, it was immediately allowed to depart. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>New York - It is reported that a maritime radio station recently intercepted a radio call from the British ship Vancouver City (4,955 tons), stating that the ship had been hit by a torpedo and the crew were now taking to the lifeboats. The ship's location was somewhere near the English Channel south of Ireland. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark - The Greek ship "Gantigo Hajatella" recently struck a German mine in the southeastern waters of Sweden and sank immediately. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome - A British government plan to obstruct the economic and trade relations between Germany and neutral countries has aroused great resentment among Italian political and economic figures. Political figures here pointed out that if Britain implements the plan, Italian commercial and shipping interests will not be subject to its control. Regarding the joint exercises of the British and French navies in Egyptian territorial waters and the concentration of British and French naval fleets near Gibraltar, people here believe that the purpose is to threaten Italy. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - After the German government released the contraband list, political figures here commented on it, saying that the intention is to obstruct Sweden's export trade and then monopolize it, forcing it to be transported to Germany. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday and the French cabinet's reorganization into a wartime cabinet have been commented on by political figures here, who say that each of these countries is determined to fight until victory, regardless of how long it takes. This is another clear proof that the German propaganda machine once said that once its troops defeated Poland, it could proceed with peace talks. This plan has clearly failed, and the German side has now changed its course, trying to persuade neutral countries, telling them that the British-made contraband list is intended to harm the trade of neutral countries and should regard that country as a "common enemy." This has been unanimously opposed by the Swedish newspapers. The Daily News also stated that "This contraband list can only strike Germany, and other countries will not be affected in any way." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces Air Force's Attitude Towards Germany; If Germany Bombs Undefended Areas of Poland, Britain Will Take the Same Measures</h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax declared in the Upper House today that if the German side implements its threat to bomb undefended towns and cities in Poland, the British government will not be bound by the instruction to British forces not to bomb undefended areas of Germany. The British government has this restriction on the condition that the enemy has the same restriction. If the enemy does not abide by this restriction, the British government will be completely free to take what action it deems appropriate. (The listeners cheered greatly.) Lord Strabolgi spoke on behalf of the Labour Party to support the government's attitude, saying that we certainly do not want to degenerate to the same barbaric level as Germany, but we also do not want to tie the hands of our military authorities, even if civilians suffer greatly as a result. Because the enemy has imposed a war in the skies upon us, we can only use free means to return what they have inflicted upon us to them, in order to destroy their economic and military power. At the beginning of his speech, the Foreign Secretary first recounted Britain's reply to President Roosevelt's appeal, saying that Britain's declaration of September 3rd, not to bomb undefended towns and cities, represents the opinion that the American and French governments have carefully considered. This morning, you have probably seen the news that the German government declared its intention to bomb undefended towns and villages in Poland to break the Polish civilians' resistance. Although this statement has not yet been officially confirmed, if it is true, it directly contradicts Hitler's previous statement in the German parliament that he did not want to wage war against women and children. Although belligerent countries have the right to kill the enemy, they ultimately have no reason to indiscriminately bombard civilians from the sea or sky. (Reuter's, 13th)</p>
<p>London - The German government has agreed to abide by the provisions of the 1925 Geneva Gas Protocol, prohibiting the use of toxic and asphyxiating gases and microbes in warfare. This was announced by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the House of Lords today. It is said that when former British Ambassador to Berlin Sir Henderson collected his exit passport from the German government, he asked whether Germany would abide by the provisions of the Protocol. The German government has now delivered a reply through the Swiss Minister in Berlin, stating that it is determined to abide by the Protocol, as British interests in Germany are now represented by the Swiss Minister. The Foreign Secretary also said that the German government had stated that if Britain and France violated the Protocol, the German government would reserve full freedom of action. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italy Decides to Resume Shipping to the Far East</h3>
<p>Rome - The Italian Postal Shipping Company has decided to reopen merchant shipping routes to Shanghai and cargo shipping routes to India and the Far East. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<p>— America's Far East Policy</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper carried a Washington telegram from the United Press, stating that President Roosevelt, at a reception for reporters the day before yesterday, elaborated on America's current international policy, with three main points: one concerning the Far East, two concerning Canada, and three concerning the various countries, dependencies, and islands of the Americas. Among them, the second and third points can be regarded as preventive measures to politically isolate Europe from the war, and have their own profound significance. Therefore, since Canada decided, 'all have responded with positive reactions. Regarding the Far East, we deeply regret that our vision and hearing are not comprehensive enough to fully understand the details. However, those who have close interests in the Far East cannot help but be delighted upon hearing the United Press telegram. It is particularly comforting for the people of Shanghai that the news came at a time when the Shanghai concessions have repeatedly suffered adversity.</p>
<p>Judging from the joy and comfort of those who have heard the news, it can be known that America's policy has not yet been clearly understood by the general public. In fact, America places the greatest emphasis on the Americas in its international relations, followed by isolating itself from the Far East, and then from Europe. Regarding the Americas, it invariably expresses its willingness to take the lead in everything. Whether in power or out of power, the consensus is unanimous. If there is anyone who covets the Americas, even by a hair's breadth, America will immediately repel them, responding like an echo. Regarding Europe, it has both likes and dislikes, and is cautiously trying to avoid getting caught in the vortex. The isolationist faction, although relatively isolated, can still stand independently, and there is a reason for this. However, the difference between likes and dislikes, and the degree of isolation, wax and wane depending on the time and circumstances. Therefore, the angle of fluctuation in America's national policy regarding the European situation is the greatest. Regarding the Far East, it uses a fixed national policy as the standard for measuring everything. If it is in line with that national policy, it is supported; if it is not in line, it is abandoned. Britain, in the Tokyo negotiations, almost knelt, almost abandoned, is the most recent example. Therefore, when it comes to the United Press telegram, we do not need to investigate the details. To put it another way, President Roosevelt, no matter how many times he reiterates it, has not added to America's fixed national policy. President Roosevelt, if he remains silent and makes no expression, has not reduced America's fixed national policy. In other words, those who care about the Far East do not need to be comforted only when they hear something, nor do they need to worry only when they hear nothing.</p>
<p>International affairs should not be dominated or manipulated by any one country. Any one country in the international arena invariably has to gradually change or drastically change its international policies in response to changes in the environment. For example, the Soviet Union and Germany changed their policies to adapt to the environment, and those surrounding the Soviet Union and Germany changed their policies in response to the changes in the Soviet Union and Germany. Therefore, to say that a certain country's international policy is fixed and unchanging is probably not an accurate statement. Therefore, there are also strategists in the international arena who are resentful that the national policies of other countries are not in their favor, and who plan to shake them; threatening with coercion, enticing with benefits, deceiving and inciting with propaganda, and running around and scheming with the techniques of diplomats, are all commonplace. Given the complexity and drama of international transformations, is it not also possible for America's national policy to be changed? Given America's tremendous power, is America not a major target of international strategists? How can we be sure that its national policy is necessarily fixed? For example, yesterday America announced that it would convene a special session of Congress on the 21st of this month to discuss amendments to the Neutrality Act. Before yesterday, the convening of a special session was a question, and the timing of the convening was also a question. After the announcement of the convening, the amendment was also a question. All these decisions are related to national policy, and all questions are the subject of efforts by international strategists. Therefore, before the day of their resolution, it cannot be said that America's national policy is fixed and unshakable. This concerns America's European policy, and there is indeed room for shaking, but it is limited to the angle that is allowed. It takes isolation as one line of the angle, and benefiting Britain and France as another line of the angle. From absolute isolation to full support for Britain and France, the angles are different but all are allowed. It can be shaken. If one tries to shake it beyond this angle, to make America aid the warlike and aggressive Germany, then it is unthinkable! As for America's Far East policy, it is even less comparable to its European policy, and there is no considerable angle to allow for fluctuation. It takes maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty as a fixed policy. Under this policy: the note submitted to Japan on December 31 of last year is its positive action; the announcement on July 26 of this year to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is its side action. In addition, there are countless "small actions" in the political, diplomatic, economic, and military spheres, such as the sudden test flight of fourteen naval bombers from the US to Pearl Harbor between the US and Japan. All these, whether positive or side, whether large or small, whether announced or implied, all take its fixed policy as the scope. Taking last year's note as an example, Japan has not yet replied. Among the "strategists," some may initially see the lack of a reply as an opportunity to steal the sky and change the day, and believe that there is room for shaking. But when the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was abolished, they suddenly awakened to the fact that the illusion was not permanent. Why? At this point, they glimpsed the unshakeability of its national policy. Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that America's attitude toward the Far East is still like the note of several months ago. It is clear that the note is still there, and cannot be dismissed. The national policy is there, the great power is there, and there is nothing to discuss with America. What awaits other countries to consider for themselves is, will they quickly change course, and leave room for themselves? Or will they wait until they are at their wits' end, and expose their ugliness?</p>
<h3>German Land and Air Forces Launch Full-Scale Encirclement Operation Against Warsaw; Seizing Fortress, Cutting Off Baltic Railway; Fierce Artillery Battles Between French and German Armies on Western Front</h3>
<p>Warsaw - According to observers here, Germany is using all its land and air forces to attack Poland. The fall of Limberg has caused Poland to lose its rich wheat fields and oil mines, and has cut off its transportation with neutral countries. The only remaining transportation is with the Soviet Union, but it is not very reliable. After the recent heavy rains, the ground is muddy, and the fate of the Polish soldiers is turning for the better. The conditions of the suburbs allow the vicinity of Warsaw to be particularly advantageous for the city's defenders. Germany has deployed seventy divisions to attack Poland. Military experts now believe that eleven divisions have been transferred from Poland to the Western front, or are in transit. Assuming Poland has 30 divisions, the German army still has the advantage. As for attacking on the Western front, to win, it is necessary to have at least a three-to-one advantage. The Saarbrücken coal mines are now useless to the Germans, as the French artillery has controlled all roads leading to the area. Observers also said that the British army's transport to France is a great demonstration of its military skill, as the weight of the mechanical equipment carried by the British army is at least thirty times greater than that of any army of the same size in the previous war. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Judging from the latest war reports from both sides, the fierce battle between the Polish and German armies is underway, fighting for the historically famous Modlin Fortress, twenty miles northwest of Warsaw. The German side broadcast a message last night, stating that the Modlin Fortress, built by Napoleon, has been captured by the German army. At the same time, the Polish message stated that the German army's attack on the fortress has been repulsed, but admitted that the Polish army around Garusin, east of Warsaw, is gradually retreating due to the pressure of the German mechanized forces. There is a rumor that the German army near Annopol has already crossed the Vistula River. This morning, the mayor of Warsaw broadcast that those who should defend Warsaw are very enthusiastic, in order to stop the advance of the enemy and make Warsaw a turning point in the war. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced today that the German army is launching a general attack on several Polish divisions surrounding Kutno, and the plan to attack Warsaw has been completed. Another German army is advancing on the Modlin Fortress from the northwest. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Fierce fighting continues on the Eastern Front. It is reported that the Polish armies in Posen and Pomerania have joined forces near Kutno. The Polish army is still repelling the enemy near Warsaw. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - The General Headquarters has just issued a war report stating that, after a fierce counterattack by the Warsaw garrison today, the German army in the suburbs could not withstand it and has begun to retreat. The fighting is fierce in the Maki area northeast of Warsaw and along the railway line from Warsaw to Vilnius. Our cavalry took advantage of the victory to pursue and intercepted ten German tanks. In the area of Kutno and Lowicz, west of Warsaw, our army continued to attack and inflicted heavy damage on the German army. The German army northwest of Warsaw advanced along the Modlin-to-Zgierz railway, but was repulsed by our army. Near the Siedlce-to-Garwolin railway line northeast of Warsaw, the German army launched a fierce attack with motorized units, and our army has been forced to retreat. The German army crossed the Vistula River in the Janopol area and is being blocked by our army. The German army on the southern route attacked Lublin with motorized units and has been repulsed. Fighting is still underway in the area of Gdynia in the northern route. In addition, our army shot down thirty German planes today. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London - According to a Warsaw radio broadcast, the people of Warsaw absolutely do not believe that the Polish capital is about to fall. Life there is gradually returning to normal. The courts continue to hold sessions, the Agricultural Bank is still operating, and the post office is still open. The people of Warsaw work together and protect each other like a large family. The German army is encountering difficulties in carrying out cleaning operations in western Poland, because the courageous Polish army is constantly active, taking advantage of various opportunities to harass them. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania - According to refugees who fled from Poland to the Romanian border, the German army on the southern route has attacked Strokolczy (73 kilometers south of Lviv). The Polish railway line to Romania has been damaged in several places by German planes. Although the fighting near Lviv is very fierce, the city is still in the hands of the Polish army. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters has just released War Report No. 20, stating, "Our army has consolidated the positions occupied in the past few days. Our navy is dealing with enemy submarine activity with strict measures. The air force is not very active due to bad weather." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters has just released War Report No. 21, stating, "The enemy used heavy artillery to fiercely bombard our positions south of Saarbrücken yesterday." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - It is admitted here that Saarbrücken and the area around Homburg have been invaded by strong French forces. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Several teams of French elite troops have rushed into German territory. Before the Siegfried Line, between Saarbrücken and Höhnbach, they are now being blocked by German-laid mines and defensive works and have been unable to advance straight in. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Petit Parisien newspaper carries a communication from a military correspondent, stating that no inch of French territory has been trampled on by the German army. On the other hand, the French army has invaded German territory from the Rhine and Moselle fronts. The French army has advanced several kilometers in the area from northeast of Sarreguemines to north of Lauterbourg, and has also made considerable progress further east between the Sarre and Horn rivers. The two armies have clashed there. The French army's recent northward thrust from both banks of the Horn River has caused its front line to advance further. The enemy artillery is retaliating strongly, apparently to cover its infantry's retreat in order to occupy the battlefield works around Saarbrücken. (Reuter's, 14th)</p>
<h3>格第尼亞港　昨已陷落</h3>
<p>Gdynia Port Falls Yesterday</p>
<p>Berlin: According to official sources here, the mayor of Gdynia surrendered the city at 8:30 this morning. The Polish commander defending the city also surrendered. German troops entered the city at 10:15. Fighting continues north of the city. (September 14th, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>教皇表示　待機恢復和平　如不可能則減輕兵</h3>
<p>The Pope Expresses Willingness to Restore Peace, or Failing That, To Alleviate Warfare</p>
<p>Rome: The Pope stated in a speech today that he will seek every opportunity to establish an honorable peace for all parties, to prevent a great calamity befalling Europe. If this proves impossible, he will endeavor to alleviate the suffering of the war, urging all belligerent nations to abide by international treaties, not to harm civilians, to treat prisoners of war well, and to avoid the use of poison gas. (September 14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to well-informed sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally appeal for peace to France within this week. Also, according to German sources, Pope Pius XII may simultaneously undertake mediation efforts, hoping to end the European war. However, the German side believes that the French government seems determined to fight to the end and may not accept Italy's peace appeal. (September 14th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly declared his determination to maintain peace. Last night, he issued a special order specifying that the construction of the 1942 World's Fair site should continue without interruption. Furthermore, the Italian government has ordered that slogans written during the Italian military expedition to Abyssinia be preserved in all locations. Observers are paying close attention to this. (September 14th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Berlin: Official sources here recently declared that contact between Germany and Italy is being maintained continuously. The report that the Italian ambassador, Attolico, is on the German front lines is untrue. However, the German military authorities have allowed Italian journalists to cover news in the war zone. When German troops crossed the Vistula River near Kulm, Poland, a few days ago, Führer Hitler personally inspected the site, and several Italian journalists were among those following him. (September 13th, Havas)</p>
<p>London: Various reports regarding peace talks in the current war abound. Well-informed sources here are paying close attention but state that the positions of the British and French governments have been clearly stated and are known throughout the world. Briefly, the British and French governments can only negotiate peace with a German government that respects good faith so that a permanent solution can be achieved without endless suspicion. Hitler's usual tactic is to apply brutal acts of aggression, one by one, to non-Germanic countries. Since this strategy has been seen through by everyone, good faith cannot be discussed with Hitler. Accordingly, as soon as a reliable government is established within Germany, the British government will, without hesitation, fulfill its previously reiterated promise and consult with its allies and other friendly nations on how to establish a fair and just peace in Europe and discuss the adjustment of economic relations among countries so that all can cooperate with each other to enjoy the world's resources.

<h3>波瀾駐美大使　沉痛演說</h3>
<p>Polish Ambassador to the United States Delivers Solemn Speech</p>
<p>Paris: Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz recently delivered a solemn speech at a banquet at the American Club, stating: "As Germany is currently using brutal means to invade Poland, with countless soldiers, women, children, and civilians dying in heaps, only the facts speak most eloquently. I wish to speak to you based on the facts. Previously, when the dispute between our country and Germany reached its most dangerous point, our government unconditionally accepted the proposal of U.S. President Roosevelt, agreeing to resolve the dispute through direct negotiations or mediation by neutral countries. Who knew that Germany would answer by invading our territory without a declaration of war? President Roosevelt then issued a call, requesting all belligerent nations not to use airplanes to bomb undefended cities, and Germany answered by bombing civilians, injuring and killing women and children. This is the real and cruel fact. Moreover, our country's involvement in this war is purely defensive in nature, to resist imperialist aggression and to protect Poland and to maintain all principles, without which all of humanity will be ruled by force and reduced to a state of slavery. We must resolutely defend our national independence and will not cease until the last German soldier leaves our territory. We have great confidence in the strength of our country and its allies."

<h3>德軍炸斷　西部鐵路　脫利爾平民撤退</h3>
<p>German Troops Bomb Western Railway Line, Trier Civilians Evacuate</p>
<p>Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Capital: German military authorities recently bombed the railway line from Trier in the west to Metz, France. The site was near Schengen in Luxembourg, and fragments of the railway track fell within Schengen but did not injure anyone. (September 13th, Havas)</p>
<p>Brussels: The village of Schengen, at the southernmost tip of Luxembourg, was shaken last night by a terrible explosion. German forces had blown up the railway line crossing the border near the village. Metal fragments fell within Luxembourg but did not injure anyone. This railway is the main route between Trier and Metz. Trier is a famous and ancient town in the German Empire, while Metz is a fortified French town in Alsace-Lorraine, 48 miles away. According to the Volkszeitung, civilians are evacuating Trier. It is strange that there has been no fighting on that front yet. Trier is the seat of a Catholic bishop and has many Roman ruins, unmatched in Northern Europe. In the third and fourth centuries, Roman emperors often resided here. (September 14th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Yugoslavia Capital: The German fishing vessel "Tristan," of 38 tons, was in the Mediterranean when the war broke out. It has now taken refuge in Ragusa harbor. To avoid capture by British warships, the fishing boat loaded seawater, submerging its hull deep below the surface, and sailed at night, hiding among small islands during the day or entering the territorial waters of neutral countries. The success of the ship in evading British warships and navigating difficult waters has attracted attention from all sides. (September 14th, Haitong)</p>

<p>Polish Aircraft Repeatedly Invade Soviet Airspace, Mostly Driven Out by Soviet Aircraft, Several Forced to Land</p>
<p>Moscow: In the past few days, Polish aircraft have increasingly violated the Soviet border, and Polish aircraft have attempted to penetrate deep into Soviet territory. On September 12th, Polish military aircraft invaded the areas of Shabytivka in Ukraine and Zhydakvichy in Belarus. Soviet military aircraft immediately took off and drove the Polish aircraft out of the country. However, Polish aircraft continued to invade Soviet territory. Yesterday, Polish bombers invaded the border areas of Klyven and Yanpol in Ukraine. At that time, a Polish twin-engine aircraft was surrounded by Soviet aircraft and landed in Soviet territory. The personnel on board, including Commander Yudyuk and pilot Byedzyk, were detained. On the same day, three Polish bombers crossed the Belarusian border at Musso. Soviet fighter aircraft immediately took off and forced the Polish aircraft to land in Soviet territory. The 12 Polish personnel on board were detained. (September 14th, TASS)</p>

<p>London: According to those familiar with current events, the Soviet Union's mysterious military preparations have been underway for two weeks. Not only are the British and French governments unclear about the Soviet Union's intentions, but the German side is also greatly surprised. According to Moscow sources, the European part of the Soviet Union has fully entered a state of war. The number of armed young men has reached four million, and these troops are not only deployed on the Polish border but along the entire border from Finland to Romania. Heavy troops have been deployed. (September 14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Moscow: Several passenger trains on the Moscow-Leningrad railway line, including the "Red Arrow Express," were suddenly suspended today. Many passengers carrying luggage spent the night at the station. This was due to frequent military transport, and many troop trains had not returned to their original stations. In recent days, many passenger trains departing from here to the west have also been suspended. In addition, there are 100 cannons at the Guskovo station near the capital, being loaded onto trains for shipment. Their caliber appears to be 155 millimeters. (September 14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>眞理報論　波蘭現局　軍事失敗主因　在於國內矛盾</h3>
<p>Pravda Discusses the Current Situation in Poland, Military Failure Mainly Due to Internal Contradictions</p>
<p>Moscow: Pravda published a commentary today analyzing the inside story and true causes of Poland's military failure. The newspaper stated that although the German-Polish war has only been going on for ten days, it can already be said that Poland has suffered a military defeat. This defeat has caused Poland to lose almost all of its political and economic centers. It is difficult to believe that this failure is purely due to the superiority of German military technology and organization, as well as the failure of Britain and France to provide Poland with effective assistance. In the German-Polish war, we have not been able to find any facts proving that the Polish army has ever given the German army strong resistance or any partial victories. All reports regarding the situation in Poland reveal that the entire Polish regime is gradually collapsing. These reports have proven Poland's weakness and incompetence, and it has been unable to recover from the initial military failure. So, what are the real causes of Poland's bankruptcy? First of all, the real cause of this failure is rooted in the internal weakness and contradictions of Poland. Poland is a country with countless ethnic groups. Purely Polish people only account for 60% of Poland's total population. The remaining 40% are composed of ethnic minorities (mostly Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Jewish). There are no fewer than eight million Ukrainians living in Poland, and there are also three million Belarusians. These two major ethnic minorities total eleven million people. To make all parties understand the importance of the status of Ukrainians and Belarusians in Poland, we should point out that the population of these two major ethnic minorities exceeds the combined population of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. From this point of view, the Polish authorities should immediately strengthen their relationship with these important ethnic minorities, should maintain their rights and interests, should grant them administrative autonomy, and should establish schools and other cultural institutions for them. It is obvious that a government that fails to grant the above-mentioned rights to ethnic minorities cannot strengthen internal unity and national strength. The Polish ruling class has in fact failed to make good use of this point and has not attempted to consolidate the national strength of a country containing many ethnic minorities based on this. On the contrary, Polish ruling figures have done everything they can to make their relationship with ethnic minorities increasingly worse. The policy of the Polish ruling class is to oppress ethnic minorities, especially Ukrainians and Belarusians. In western Ukraine and western Belarus, the people have been brutally exploited by Polish landlords. They have not only been subjected to oppression but have also been deprived of all rights. Although the Polish ruling class boasts of their love of freedom, they have in fact done everything they can to turn western Ukraine and western Belarus into colonies. The rights of the people there have been completely deprived. In this regard, Poland's policy is completely the same as the policy adopted by Imperial Russia. The Polish ruling class has implemented their policies, forcing Ukrainians and Belarusians to become Polonized. Western Ukraine and western Belarus have now become territories for Polish military colonial personnel. Although Poles are in the minority there, they have seized great power. The language has also been Polonized. All officials are Polish and do not recognize any language other than Polish. Non-Polish people are not allowed to hold government positions. The Polish authorities' method of ruling ethnic minorities is as follows: (1) suppression; (2) military tribunals; (3) white terror; (4) inciting divisions within ethnic minorities. The cultural institutions of Ukraine and Belarus have been almost completely destroyed. Polish legislation not only does not grant ethnic minorities autonomy but has also deprived them of the right to study in their own languages. This forced means of Polonizing Ukrainians and Belarusians is not only applied in schools, but Ukrainian and Belarusian literature, newspapers, and art have also suffered the same fate. As a result, Ukrainian and Belarusian culture has fallen into a state of decline. The above are all the true reasons why Poland has failed and cannot achieve internal unity. In fact, if the Polish army and ethnic minorities were united, they could still work hard to stop the advance of the opposing army. Ethnic minorities have not been able to and cannot become a reliable rear guard for Poland. This country, which contains many ethnic minorities, has failed to unite as a strong army due to the oppression of ethnic minorities. The above are all Poland's fundamental weaknesses and the true reasons for Poland's military failure." (September 14th, TASS)</p>

<p>Romania Capital: According to reports from Poland received here indirectly, German aircraft bombed a Polish ambulance train on the railway line near Kutno, west of Warsaw. Also, a Polish destroyer is disrupting German maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea to great effect. (September 13th, Havas)</p>
<p>Romania Capital: According to reports from Poland received here indirectly, the city of Lviv in southwestern Poland is still held by Polish forces. German aircraft flew to bomb it at 7:00 PM today. Also, 70 German aircraft flew to Warsaw today to drop bombs. It is reported that half of them were shot down by Polish anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. One bomb fell on a main street in Warsaw, killing 15 women. (September 13th, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German news agency deeply regrets the accidental shooting down of a Dutch aircraft outside Dutch territory. It issued a statement, stating, "We fully understand the Netherlands' determination to firmly maintain its neutrality and not be subjected to any infringement. We deeply regret the unfortunate incident of the sacrifice of a Dutch aircraft and the serious threat to the Dutch pilots. On the other hand, the pilot of the German reconnaissance plane is not to be blamed, as the incident occurred due to the various unfortunate circumstances that are inevitable during wartime." (September 14th, Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating: "A German reconnaissance plane was flying near the Dutch island of Ameland when a Dutch plane suddenly pursued it. At that time, the German plane mistook it for an enemy plane and immediately shot it down. It was not until the Dutch plane landed that its nationality was identified. It then landed and rescued the four Dutch pilots. Fortunately, the pilots only suffered minor injuries. Afterwards, the Dutch side also admitted its mistake because it failed to identify the nationality of the German plane, causing the misunderstanding. In addition, another German plane was forced to land on Ameland due to engine damage. (September 13th, Havas)</p>

<h3>義國保持　軸心政策</h3>
<p>Italy Maintains Axis Policy</p>
<p>Rome: The Giornale d'Italia recently reviewed Italy's foreign policy, stating that its key points are five: (1) Italy continues to pursue the Axis policy and has not changed its course. Its reserved attitude toward the current war is because Italy is a "non-belligerent country" and must respect the international obligations it has previously accepted. (2) Italy's failure to join the war is because Mussolini does not want to waste manpower. German Führer Hitler also notified Prime Minister Mussolini that the country's strength is sufficient to win alone. (3) Italy has a strong military force and is now ready to fight. Mussolini will use it to join the scales at the appropriate time. (4) Fascist Italy does not want to be all things to all people but is moving forward on the right path. With this decision, Germany will surely win. When the time comes for the old plutocratic countries to be replaced by young and all-powerful countries, Italy will surely get its due share. (5) Italy will surely achieve its suspended goal. In essence, its demands for Tunis, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal will be achieved. In short, the Italy under the leadership of Prime Minister Mussolini is not what it used to be. In the past, the Italian nation shed its blood all over the world so that other countries could enjoy civilization, freedom, and wealth, while it was willing to endure hardship. This is not what Italy is talking about today. (September 14th, Havas)</p>

<p>Minister of Colonies: Mandel (retained)</p>
<p>Note: The new features of the wartime cabinet are that the original economic affairs have been divided into the Blockade Department and the Armaments Department. From now on, military and diplomatic powers will be exclusively controlled by Prime Minister Daladier. The French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, will serve as a confidential secretary for foreign affairs in the Prime Minister's Office. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier invited the Socialist Party to participate in the wartime cabinet, but the party declined, but promised to fully support the cabinet. (September 14th, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris: After the cabinet was reorganized into a wartime cabinet, all morning newspapers praised it. They said that Prime Minister Daladier had combined the duties of national defense and diplomacy. One newspaper stated that the new cabinet may not be permanent and may be reorganized again sooner or later to become a true wartime cabinet. The right-wing newspaper Le Temps stated, "It is an innovation for the Prime Minister to serve concurrently as head of national defense and foreign affairs. At a time when the government often makes important decisions and executes them quickly, this move is appropriate." (September 14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British Intelligence Agency's Failure to Fulfill Duties Arouses Criticism from Parliamentarians</h3>
<p>London - Today in the British House of Commons, there was considerable criticism of the newly established intelligence agency for its failure to promptly release important news. Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the intelligence agency only began working after the outbreak of hostilities, and during times of military urgency, errors were inevitable, causing difficulties for newspapers. He expressed regret for such mistakes but was gratified by the cooperation of the newspapers with the government. The government is eager to provide the public with the most detailed information to eliminate their doubts, which is the principle the government intends to implement. Labour leader Greenwood stated that, looking back to last week, the intelligence agency only issued a very simple report after a delay regarding the glorious achievement of the British Air Force in bombing a German warship in the Kiel naval port, and never informed the public of the glorious significance of this operation. Two days later, the Prime Minister gave a detailed report on this air raid in the House of Commons, and then the intelligence agency gradually released the details of the operation. This operation proved the courage and determination of the British Air Force, and for the sake of encouraging the Air Force and the public, the details of this great undertaking by the British Air Force under dangerous conditions should have been announced as soon as possible. The Prime Minister had previously admitted the error and hoped for future improvements, but the news released from France on Monday night and early Tuesday morning regarding the arrival of British troops in France still left people speechless. The intelligence agency's handling of this news caused national panic and wasted unnecessary funds. Editorials in various newspapers used the term "chaotic," which was not surprising. This was the worst kind of chaos and should be explained in detail. If such situations are not prevented, they will greatly affect the national psyche and have more serious consequences for newspapers overseas, as the world is eager for news. If news cannot be obtained from Britain, rumors and propaganda will be adopted. The British side has not taken effective counter-measures, so Hitler's propaganda is now poisoning world opinion to the disadvantage of Britain, providing completely false ideas to neutral countries, obscuring the truth about Britain and overseas. Liberal Party leader Sinclair also said that the intelligence agency's handling of affairs was extremely chaotic and failed to fulfill its extremely important duties, resulting in the public at home and abroad receiving insufficient and delayed news. Home Secretary Hoare acknowledged in his reply that there had been misunderstandings and regrettable confusion on Monday night but said that arrangements had been reorganized and that each department had a senior official in the department all day long, maintaining close contact with each other. He believed that situations like Monday night would not happen again. As for the British Air Force's bombing of the German naval port, it was difficult to issue a public statement before the facts were verified, resulting in a slight delay. However, it has now been decided that general public statements can be issued quickly in the future, without waiting for all the details to be known. As for inspection, the government is willing to handle it on a cooperative basis. The government provides newspapers with certain general regulations, but newspapers do not have to send every news item through the inspection office. Responsible reporters can use telephones and wireless telephones to the United States. Inspectors are stationed in the telegraph office to work nearby, reviewing telegrams. Telegrams in clear code in various languages can now be passed by inspectors in the telegraph office who are proficient in various languages.

<h3>Czech Army Stands Alone</h3>
<p>Paris - Czech sources here declared today that the Czech troops organized in France will not be listed as foreign legions or volunteer forces, but formally as troops of the Allied nations, since the democratic nations have not legally recognized Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia. The Czech troops will establish their own command and headquarters, participating in the war under the supreme command of France. The command duties will be undertaken by the French military commission led by General Faucher, who has held the same position in Prague for many years. The political representative of the army will be the Czech provisional government led by former Czech President Beneš. The British and French governments are currently in negotiations regarding the recognition of this provisional government. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Forces in Northern Henan Recover Wen County and Chongyi; Japanese Retreat Towards Qinyang; Chinese Forces Pursuing in Multiple Directions</h3>
<p>Luoyang - The Japanese forces in northern Henan have been constantly active since occupying Wen County in February of this year. Since the 7th, the Chinese × unit has been active on the Qin-Chong and Qin-Bo highways, adopting a strategy of converging encirclement, vigorously attacking the Japanese forces in Wen County and Chongyi. After a week of bloody battles, they achieved successive victories, becoming unstoppable. On the evening of the 13th, they successively recovered Wen County and Chongyi, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Qinyang. The Chinese × unit is consoling the people while pursuing in multiple directions. It is reported that Wen County has been occupied for more than half a year, and today it was recovered by the Chinese army, further strengthening the defense of the river. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Unfold on the Hunan-Hubei Front</h3>
<p>Miluo - The Japanese forces in northern Hunan are entrenched along Yanglousi via Zhongfang. Over the past three days, the Chinese forces have launched attacks on this line in several directions, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese forces in the vicinity of Zhongfang and Yanglousi. The Japanese forces have now been cut into several sections by the Chinese forces and are being encircled and annihilated separately. Furthermore, warships are frequently seen patrolling the waterways of the Yangtze River into Dongting Lake. At 7:00 AM on the 11th, a certain Chinese unit discovered four Japanese boats under the cover of two Japanese warships, heading towards Chenglingji. They opened fire from a certain location, sinking two Japanese boats. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sweep Away Newspaper Advocates for Centralized Political Power</h3>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, the "Sweep Away" newspaper published an article strongly opposing the proposal for China to immediately establish a constitutional government. It argued that at this time of severe national crisis and nationwide resistance, it is necessary to concentrate power to ensure efficiency, speed, and secrecy. Constitutional rights are temporarily suspended during wartime, as is the case in various Western countries. The motivation behind this proposal is simply to establish laws allowing parties other than the Kuomintang to exist. However, such matters should be discussed after the war ends. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Prepare to Invade Shashi and Yichang; Secretly Plot to Cut Off Contact Between Shashi and Yichang; Chinese Side Fully Prepared</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to a certain Chinese official who recently returned here from the front lines in western Hubei, the situation there is very tense due to the Japanese side's preparations to attack Shashi and Yichang. Currently, the Japanese side is concentrating a large number of Japanese warships in Yuezhou, preparing to attack Shashi and Yichang along the Yangtze River. At the same time, the Japanese army is preparing to concentrate the forces of three divisions as the basis for a westward advance. Judging from the Japanese deployment, it seems they intend to launch a joint attack by land, air, and sea. The task of the Japanese navy is to break the blockade line between Yuezhou and Shashi, while the army advances along the land route. It is reported that the Japanese have already crossed the Han River in the Shayang area and are now attempting to occupy Shilipu, 30 miles north of Shashi, in order to cut off the contact between Shashi and Yichang, and also to cut off the contact between Yichang and the northwestern part of Hubei province, as Shilipu is the intersection of highways in various parts of Hubei province. According to the official, although Japanese aircraft constantly bomb the rear cities of the Chinese army in Hubei province, business is still as usual everywhere. At the same time, the Chinese military authorities in central Hubei are fully prepared for the Japanese offensive. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Official Observation: U.S. Statement on Unchanged Far East Policy Intended to Warn Japanese Actions; U.S. Determined Not to Allow Japan to Seize Rights in China During European War Opportunity</h3>
<p>Chongqing - President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull declared that there has been no change in the United States' Far East policy. It is believed here that this is a warning to Japanese actions aimed at establishing a "central government" and reducing the rights of foreigners. It is also a kind of support in response to the Japanese request for Britain and France to withdraw their troops from China. Chinese officials here believe that the United States will never allow Japan to take advantage of the European war opportunity to eliminate the rights of European countries in China.

<h3>Soviet Union Denies Occupying Manchurian Territory</h3>
<p>Moscow - According to a Reuters correspondent in Chongqing, an American journalist recently toured the "Man"Mongolian border area, pointing out that the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces had occupied most of the Manchurian region after winning the battle. TASS has been authorized to declare that the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces have not occupied, nor do they intend to occupy, an inch of "Manchurian" territory. The Reuters report is purely fabricated. (TASS, 18th)</p>
<p>Beiping - Local troop movements and news from the three northeastern provinces are now arousing various speculations. It is unknown whether the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in China will pay more attention to China or the Soviet Union. There are already many military empty cars running along the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese spokesperson here does not acknowledge it, perhaps wanting to transport troops back to Shanxi Province. At the same time, according to very reliable foreign sources, the Soviet forces broke through the Japanese main force on the Nomonhan front line a few days ago, and there is also news from Changchun that the Soviet army advanced five kilometers along the three-thousand-kilometer front. For this reason, people here generally predict that the Japanese will now take action again to restore the Mongolian border. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Beiping - According to local Chinese newspapers, the Japanese army has sent 45,000 Chinese laborers to Mongolia to strengthen the defense line in Inner Mongolia. Another 50,000 Chinese laborers will be sent to the area successively this month. Furthermore, according to reliable foreign sources, the Japanese army in Shanxi and Shandong has already withdrawn.

<h3>Military Spokesman Discusses War Situation on All Fronts in the Past Week: September 6th to September 12th</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A military commission spokesman discussed the activities of Japanese forces on all fronts this week (September 6th to September 12th). After repeated attacks by our loyal and brave soldiers, they were repeatedly thwarted. Now, they have added a so-called "Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army," attempting to use institutional reforms to conceal the failure of the invasion of China. Regarding the progress of the operations, the important points are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Shanxi Front: After our army in southeastern Shanxi recovered the important stronghold of Jincheng and killed more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers, they fled north through Gaoping to the Changzhi, Huguan, Changzi, and Lucheng area. Our officers and soldiers exerted even more courage and pursued in various directions. It is estimated that the central route, since recovering Gaoping last week, advanced north along the Baixin Highway, besieging Changzhi and successively recovering various strongholds, including Zizhang, Sudianzhen, and Xinyicun. The right wing thoroughly cleared out the remnants of the Japanese forces near Huguan and Lucheng, east of the Baixin Highway, tightly surrounding the county seats, and defeated the Japanese forces that invaded Wuxiang from Qin County, cutting off the road for reinforcements. Huguan County was recovered on the 9th. After recovering Baodianzhen and Tunliu County, the left wing continued to attack Changzi, successively recovering various strongholds west of the Baixin Highway, including Tangdong, Wangjiabao, Tufangcun, Hetoucun, Xidonghe, and Shitoucun, occupying the southwest passes, and the county seat was immediately recovered. In total, in this campaign, more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers were killed before and after. As for the Japanese forces who invaded western Shanxi along the Zhongli Highway, after being fiercely attacked head-on, they successively recovered places such as Jundu and Mucun, with more than 600 casualties. They are currently attacking Liulin.</p>
<p>Henan-Hubei Front: The Japanese army was extremely panicked after our army in eastern Henan attacked Qixian last week, occupying the east and west passes. They dispatched troops to reinforce Qianjiang in central Hubei for days, once infiltrating Yujiaqiao and shelling us. After our army crossed the river and launched a flanking attack, they did not dare to engage and fled back into the city. Furthermore, Japanese forces from the western side of the river were annihilated after our advance, with more than 100 horses killed. They retreated to Yaodi. The Japanese forces on the outskirts of Jingshan City were besieged by us for days, with more than half annihilated. Several attempts to break through failed and are still being surrounded and annihilated. As for the enemy in southern Hubei, they repeatedly attempted to infiltrate Shentangpu from Nanlinqiao for days, but were repelled by us, with more than 200 killed and wounded. On the 7th, our army attacked Jietouguan and recovered it, cutting off the connection between Nanlinqiao and Baini Bridge. Subsequently, our army divided its forces again and attacked Beigang, attacking between Linxiang and Yanglousi on the 10th, capturing many. On the 12th, they attacked the Japanese forces southeast of Baini Bridge, annihilating Japanese officer Kyu Ta-lang and more than 200 officers and soldiers. Overall, in southern Hubei, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely from north of the Xinqiang River to Nanlinqiao. Although the remnant Japanese forces struggled desperately, the Chinese officers and soldiers were brave and decisive, and took the upper hand everywhere. The Japanese army is now unable to move.</p>

<h3>National Government Approves Tax Reduction Measures</h3>
<p>Chongqing - It has been found that imported goods that are necessary for the people's livelihood during the war of resistance are not on the embargo list. The Ministry of Finance has drafted tax reduction measures for imported goods and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for approval. Starting from September 2nd, all will be levied at one-third of the current tax rate. The National Government's order on September 1st regarding the tax reduction of essential goods for the people's livelihood is recorded as follows: According to the Executive Yuan's report, it is now noted that since the two years of the war of resistance, the people have endured hardships and made sacrifices. In order to provide the people with essential goods for their livelihood at a low price, detailed import tax reduction measures have been determined. All goods not embargoed in the measures for prohibiting the import of goods during the extraordinary period on July 1st of this year will be levied at one-third of the current import tax rate, effective from September 2nd, until the end of the war. After checking, it has been found that imported goods that are necessary for the people's livelihood are not on the embargo list. At this time of war of resistance, tax reductions can be granted. The proposed imposition of one-third of the current tax rate from September 2nd of this year until the end of the war is still feasible and should be approved for implementation. This order should be forwarded to be observed and implemented. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. President Orders Convening of Special Session of Congress; Majority of Senators and Representatives Favor Repealing Arms Embargo Provision of Neutrality Act; Roosevelt Issues Statement on Prices</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt has called a special session of Congress to convene on September 21, fulfilling his promise to find a way to repeal the arms embargo provision of the Neutrality Act after the outbreak of the European war. The President has again sent a telegram to the leaders of both Democratic and Republican parties in the House and Senate, asking them to gather at the White House on September 20 for an informal meeting. The President's decision to call a special session of Congress is the result of inquiring about the attitudes of individual members of Congress, as the President is now confident that there will be a majority in the House to support the repeal of the ban, and more than half of the Senate will support it. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. government does not intend to take any steps to curb rising prices for the time being, as can be seen from President Roosevelt's statements today. The President declared that cotton prices are still too low, and wheat can rise to at least $1.16 per bushel without harming consumers. He is now paying attention to the value of copper, as it is profitable to sell copper at $0.125 per pound, so he decided not to let it rise as it did during the last European war. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday ordered the convening of a special session of Congress to be held on September 21. The administration will debate with isolationists regarding the amendment of the Neutrality Act at this meeting. The intention of the administration is to have Congress amend the arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act, so that the United States can sell arms to the European belligerents on a cash-and-carry basis. The President will deliver a special speech at the special session of Congress, stating his position on amending the Neutrality Act. If the Neutrality Act can be amended according to the wishes of the administration, it will greatly benefit Britain and France, as their navies have almost completely driven German warships out of the high seas. The special session of Congress will see a fierce battle between the White House and the isolationists in Congress. Senator Borah and President Ni, who proposed changing the Supreme Court, launched a major attack. The President officially signed the order to convene a special session of Congress yesterday, with the time set for noon on September 21. In a conversation with the leaders of the two parties before the opening, the President will urge them to pay attention to the current world crisis. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Members of the British Parliament today do not hide their joy at the U.S. President's calling of a special session of Congress. Government lawmakers believe that amending the Neutrality Act is a matter of U.S. internal affairs and are unwilling to express an opinion, but opposition lawmakers are free to discuss it without any reservations. According to Labour leader Greenwood, "The American public seems to have recognized the center of gravity of the world situation, and has understood the indirect relationship with the democratic countries." (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Prominent isolationist Senator Ni declared yesterday that it would be unthinkable if the United States participated in the affairs of European belligerent countries, and said that he welcomed the special session of Congress convened on September 21. The administration can defend all opinions. They believe that opposing the wishes of the administration is a pro-Hitler expression. Ni also said that isolationists will do everything possible to oppose any action by the government to associate with European belligerent countries. Isolationists will let the people of the country know "the direction in which Roosevelt's policies are leading." Other isolationists also expressed satisfaction with the decision to convene a special session of Congress, saying that this would allow a decision to be made on the Neutrality Act. Representative Rogers of Massachusetts said that she hoped that Congress would meet regularly before this world crisis passed. Other members of Congress said that various proposals, such as those concerning relief and prevention of espionage, will be put forward at this session. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, it is believed here that if the cash-and-carry provision for abolishing the arms embargo is adopted, it will benefit Japan in the Far East. Therefore, when the cash-and-carry clause is passed, the Pittman proposal to sanction Japan must also be passed simultaneously. Otherwise, we can only abolish the entire U.S. Neutrality Act and adhere purely to international law as a guide, so that the United States can cope with both Europe and the Far East.

<h3>United States to Hold Regular Pan-American Conference</h3>
<p>Washington - According to sources here today, the State Department has scheduled a Pan-American Conference to be held on September 23 to discuss the issue of neutrality for all countries in the Americas. The conference will be held in Panama City. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - After the British government informed the governments of Central and South America not to allow Germany to set up submarine bases on their coasts, a senior official of the U.S. State Department recently declared, "This issue will also be included on the agenda when the Pan-American Conference is held in Panama in the coming days."

<h3>South African Minister to Germany Has Not Yet Left the Country</h3>
<p>London - According to sources in Berlin, after the South African Federation announced its declaration of war against Germany, the country's minister to Germany has not yet returned home. He must wait until the German minister to the country returns to Berlin before he can leave here. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Aircraft Squadron Ordered to Pearl Harbor; Long-Distance Flight Across Pacific</h3>
<p>San Diego - Fourteen U.S. Navy bombers made a non-stop group flight from San Diego Bay to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii yesterday. This military movement was the result of secret orders, so few knew about it beforehand. The bomber squadron had a total of 95 personnel, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ingersoll. The last aircraft departed here at 3:30 PM, when the weather was quite clear and the wind direction was exceptionally favorable for navigation. According to naval officials, this flight was "extremely secret," so the aircraft could not report their location to their base by radio during the flight. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government's Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Nichinichi Shimbun" newspaper today published an editorial discussing various aspects of Japan's diplomatic policy, and the Japanese government's decision to grant the Prime Minister the supreme authority to handle state affairs. The article stated that Britain is currently inquiring with Japan about the possibility of reopening the Tokyo Conference, but unless Britain declares its willingness to resolve the Tianjin economic dispute within two or three meetings, Japan does not see any benefit in reopening the conference. As for the Tianjin economic dispute, it arose from Japan's demand for the handover of Chinese silver stored in the Chinese-British Bank in the British Concession of Tianjin, and the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender. The article also mentioned Japanese-American relations, stating that some quarters in Japan are closely watching the attitude of the United States. There are rumors that the United States will increase its naval presence in Shanghai, which they see as a precursor to a hardening of American policy towards Japan. However, most Japanese people feel that the responsibility of jointly undertaking police duties in various areas of the Public Concession can be decided through meetings convened by the commanders of the various countries' troops stationed in Shanghai. The increase in the American naval presence in Shanghai is unlikely to become a major cause of friction between Japan and the United States. Furthermore, Japan hopes that the various problems arising from the United States' abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation can be resolved through a general adjustment of relations between the two countries. As for Italy and Germany, the Japanese government still recognizes the validity of the Anti-Comintern Pact. However, in Japanese diplomacy, the position of the Axis must be resolved in accordance with Japan's independent judgment. This is also due to the current relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany. The article concluded by stating that the Japanese government currently intends to adhere to a policy of non-intervention in the European war and to maintain Japan's strictly free hand in diplomacy.

<h3>British Post Office Restricts Foreign Postal Money Orders</h3>
<p>London: The Post Office announced today that people buying foreign money orders from post offices (including those sent to British Egypt, Sudan, Hong Kong, Canada, and Newfoundland) must not exceed ten pounds in face value, and must state the reason for buying the money order in advance.

<h3>The Shift in the New International Situation on the Eve of the Outbreak of the European War by Uncle Di; A Review of Britain's Errors in Cunning Diplomatic Policies; The Inside Story of the Sudden Compromise Between Germany and the Soviet Union; Japan Suffers Germany's Absolute Abandonment</h3>
<p>For the past few months, what has been worrying most enlightened and farsighted people in the Allied countries is the fundamental redivision of the international situation: the German-Italian-Spanish group dominating the European continent; France, stripped of all neighboring allies, having to rely solely on the other side of the English Channel, working closely with Britain, and then placing its greatest reliance on the United States far across the Atlantic; China and the Soviet Union in the Far East further joining hands. And the greatest prerequisite for all of this is undoubtedly the establishment of a detente between Germany and the Soviet Union; and as a result, the greatest prerequisite for this buffer relationship is undoubtedly the complete neutralization of all countries between the Arctic Ocean and the Black Sea. Among all the unfavorable international situations that one can imagine for Britain, this is probably the most unfavorable. However, under the Chamberlain cabinet's stubborn pursuit of its unique path, this is an inevitable outcome. Therefore, in recent months, their efforts to combat the "Chamberlain cabinet's line" can certainly be regarded as having been exerted to the greatest extent. However, in the end, because their strength was still insufficient to promote the early establishment of a British-French-Soviet military alliance, they disappointedly saw the building of a buffer zone between Germany and the Soviet Union amid Prime Minister Chamberlain's strong atmosphere of appeasement towards Germany.</p>
<p>The announcement of the "German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact" came like a bolt from the blue. The first to feel a major unease, presumably, was Japan in the Far East; the second most uneasy, of course, was Britain and France.</p>
<p>Britain's tension and anger in the past two days are, of course, needless to say. Some people attribute this to the Soviet Union's "betrayal" of Britain and France and the "peace front," while others attribute this to Germany's "betrayal" of its own ally Japan. And a very strange and glaring phenomenon is that some people are actually feeling sorry for Japan's grievances against Germany, which is a miracle that has never been seen before. Of course, that is only to vent their anger against Germany and the Soviet Union. Others believe that this is due to the error created by Polish Foreign Minister Beck. But they all have a difficult to express secret, that is, the major error of the "Chamberlain cabinet line." On this, everyone in Britain now can be said to be crystal clear. However, in order to avoid internal friction and cope with the current crisis, in the past two days, following the "German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact," all attacks on Prime Minister Chamberlain have suddenly ceased within Britain. Except for the Communist Party's newspapers, all British newspapers and opinion organs have also unified their arguments. In other words, it has entered a state of war. As seen from a wartime perspective, this is naturally good; but as seen from an emergency diplomatic measure before the outbreak of war, this contains a very serious crisis.</p>
<p>We must know that even though Germany and the Soviet Union have formally signed a "non-aggression pact," if they cannot completely neutralize all countries between them, then even with this pact, the buffer zone will still be empty talk. Among all the countries between the Arctic Ocean and the Black Sea, the most important one at the moment is, of course, only Poland. On Poland, the key to the overall victory or defeat of Britain and France against Germany and Italy in Europe's future contest is hanging. What is Poland's attitude towards Britain and France? The reporter has already said in a previous communication, and will not repeat it now. Speaking of this, every observer who loves Britain cannot help but regret the errors of the British government's diplomatic application to Poland in the past two or three months. Since the alliance has been announced, what should follow is always sincere acceptance. Then, may I ask, what are the secret contacts, guided by Prime Minister Chamberlain, constantly aiming to sacrifice Danzig to Germany, and the actions, led by Finance Minister Simon, vigorously sabotaging loans to Poland, for? Under such circumstances, can you be sure that Poland will not feel disheartened? Will it fully trust Britain and France?</p>
<p>Therefore, our original assumption was that the first action of Britain after the convening of the emergency parliamentary meeting should be to reorganize the current government, adding Churchill, Eden, Duff Cooper, and others to form an expanded cabinet. This has long been the unanimous request of all parties in Britain. Unexpectedly, the first action of yesterday's parliament was to instead grant the current cabinet full power for emergency measures.</p>
<p>Will the Chamberlain cabinet change its past style? Until this time, can Germany and Italy really believe that Britain and France will definitely rise up to aid Poland? Is Poland completely reassured by the aid of Britain and France? This series of questions is really the biggest key to the future European situation. Here, I still do not have definitive evidence that I can judge. However, my intention is to remind everyone to pay close attention to this life-and-death place.</p>
<p>Below, I intend to give a general objective review of the various aspects of this new international situation.</p>
<p>(1) Two Most Fundamental Changes</p>
<p>In recent years, everyone has become accustomed to two of the most fundamental explanations for the international situation: one is that, on the Soviet side, in order to prevent the formation of the "Anti-Communist Crusade," it has to be prepared at any time to join hands with all anti-aggression countries, even Britain and France. This is the origin of the Soviet Union's "collective security" slogan. The other is that, on the German side, in order to conceal its own expansion, it has to constantly advocate anti-communism and an attack on the Soviet Union. This has produced the so-called "Anti-Comintern Group." Therefore, the possibility of a German-Soviet detente is often immediately considered by everyone to be extremely difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>No matter what, a Soviet-German detente is absolutely impossible, right? - Those who think this way, like Chamberlain, dared to openly let go, on the one hand, secretly contacting Germany, instigating an attack on the Soviet Union, and at the same time, negotiating with the Soviet Union on the so-called "peace front limited to Europe;" on the other hand, uniting with various countries to prevent Hitler from expanding again, and at the same time, even though Japan and the Soviet Union have entered a state of semi-warfare in the Far East, Britain is still conducting what is called "Tokyo Negotiations" with Japan.</p>
<p>Some people had already warned people like Chamberlain: Isn't this promoting a Soviet-German detente? And these days, France has repeatedly sent warnings about this point.</p>
<p>In the end, it was this misbelief that the Soviet Union and Germany could hardly ease tensions that messed things up. They only kept in mind the "collective security" slogan and the international environment at the time of the "Anti-Comintern Group" organization, and ignored several of the biggest changes in the international situation in the past two or three years, which affected the fundamentals of the international situation.</p>
<p>The first is the success of China's resistance war. The second is the continuous and amazing expansion of Soviet strength.</p>
<p>The success of China's war of resistance is now beyond doubt. Except for some internal difficulties in China that still need to be overcome, from the perspective of the international environment, China's prospects are a bright road. Therefore, all countries have to consider their overall diplomatic policies in light of this new situation. First of all, of course, is the Soviet Union. Once the situation of China's war of resistance is stabilized, the danger of the Soviet Union being attacked from both east and west has been completely lifted. With such a friendly country as China sitting in its east, it can attack or defend against all enemies in Europe to the west. Therefore, compared to all international changes, it is watching China's war of resistance with the greatest concern. Last spring, when Special Envoy Sun Zhe-sheng passed through London, he said: "When China can defeat Japan alone, the Soviet Union will not move; but if the Chinese situation is very critical, the Soviet Union will definitely launch a joint attack on Japan." This is naturally not without basis.</p>
<p>As for Germany, since recalling its military advisors in China last year, Hitler had a very clear idea of the strength of China and Japan from their reports. These military advisors unanimously believed that Japan had no hope of winning; on the contrary, the front line would become longer and longer day by day, and the time would become longer and longer, and in the end, China would have a day of victory. After that, Germany had lost hope for the Japanese army's help, and the remaining contacts disappointed Germany one by one. Therefore, from Germany's point of view, Japan's value in the "Anti-Comintern Group" was decreasing day by day. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Longzhou, Guangxi; Zhennanguan Was Tragically Bombed by Japanese Planes; Goods Worth Millions of Dollars Were Lost; Japanese Planes Flew from the Qinlian Sea Area</h3>
<p>Longzhou Correspondence: Guangxi's export of products overseas has always taken Wuzhou as its concentration point, transporting them to Guangzhou or Hong Kong via the Xijiang River, and its imported goods are also the same. Since the Sanshui River Estuary was blocked by the Japanese army, the Xijiang River shipping has been completely suspended. Therefore, most of Guangxi's products have been changed to Longzhou Zhennanguan, taking the Dian-Viet Railway to Annan for export. Since the route of goods transportation has changed, the once barren and desolate Zhennanguan has suddenly become bustling. The Central Resources Committee, the Guangxi Trade Office, and other transportation companies have all set up offices there. Zhennanguan is the throat of Dian, Yue and Gui transportation, with highways leading in all directions. After the goods are concentrated in Zhennanguan, they can be transported to Chongqing, Guiyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning and other places by highway. Hundreds of trucks transporting goods travel every day, weaving back and forth. The goods of various transportation companies, after being inspected by the Longzhou Customs, are re-inspected by the inspection office established by the local government and the Qian'ai checkpoint, checking the import and export of goods. Anyone exporting goods from Longzhou to Zhennanguan to take the train must go through three inspection procedures before they can pass. The same is true for imports. Recently, due to the prosperous entry and exit of goods from various transportation companies, the inspection procedures are cumbersome, resulting in the accumulation of goods around the checkpoint, like hills and mounds. Some unscrupulous officials take advantage of the opportunity for shippers to compete for priority, and then profit from it. If the shippers make gifts, the goods will be inspected as soon as they arrive, without any stagnation or difficulty. On the contrary, their goods will have to be piled up and waited for, and even after waiting for more than a week, they have not yet been inspected. Because there are too many goods piled up at each checkpoint, it has gradually attracted the attention of the Japanese. From the 14th to the 20th of last month, Japanese planes have been flying to bomb Zhennanguan and Longzhou, continuously for as many as six times. From the 25th to the 30th, there were three consecutive bombings. After Longzhou Zhennanguan was tragically bombed, most of the public goods stored were moved to Pingxiang and Ningming for storage. They were detected by Japanese planes again. On the 2nd of this month, Japanese planes flew to bomb Ningming and Pingxiang. According to investigation, the Japanese planes took off from the Qinlian Sea Area. There is currently a dragon-class aircraft carrier anchored in this sea area, which is responsible for flying to bomb Longzhou Zhennanguan. It can be seen that the Japanese army has paid attention to destroying China's transportation and resources. It is heard that recently, most of the goods imported from Zhennanguan are gasoline, kerosene, diesel, matches, flour, medicines, automobiles, and electrical materials and mechanical parts. The imported goods are tung oil, tea, tungsten, tin, anise oil, star anise, cinnamon, and cowhide, which are controlled by the Resources Committee Trade Office. The loss of this bombing is mainly in gasoline, tung oil, vehicles, tungsten, tin, and other goods. On the 15th of last month, the Longzhou Customs and the Zhennanguan Inspection Branch were completely bombed. An American customs officer was also injured and is now receiving treatment in Liangshan. The goods burned for more than 20 hours before being put out. The loss should be more than several million dollars. According to the opinions of local people, the reasons why the loss of public and private goods is so heavy are as follows: (1) There are too many imported and exported goods, and the inspectors have not been able to complete the inspection on time, and they are still stagnant and piled up; (2) Due to too few transportation trucks and ships, it is impossible to clear the accumulated goods; (3) The officials in charge of transportation failed to store the goods in a safe area in advance, and there were no good warehouses near the checkpoint. Due to the above reasons, the Japanese planes took advantage of the gap to bomb, and burned the goods that had been transported with difficulty, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>The Blood Debt of Min Province Suffering Tragic Bombing by Japanese Planes; As of July This Year, The Total Number of Dead and Wounded Reached More Than 1,000 People</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In this province, Japanese planes have been wildly bombing repeatedly. The deaths and injuries of innocent civilians and property losses are urgently awaiting investigation. It is now heard that the Provincial Relief Association has reported the investigation of each county and district. As of the end of July this year, the statistics show that the rampant Japanese planes dropped 1,556 bombs, killing 344 people, wounding 516 people, and displacing more than 1,100 households due to the disaster. The property loss was 5,126,342 yuan. The counties of Fuzhou, Minhou, Lianjiang, Jinjiang, Tongan, and Longxi suffered the most severe losses. In Tai, Zhenhai, and Xiaocheng in Lianjiang alone, more than 400 houses were destroyed on July 23 alone, and more than 2,100 people were displaced, with property losses of 2 million. The remaining counties and districts that have not been reported are not included. The association has issued 77,200 yuan in air raid relief funds, and the amount that each county and district has drawn from the county relief fund in advance is not included.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of the Ministry of Education Compiling Wartime Supplementary Teaching Materials; Seven Subjects of Teaching Materials for Primary and Secondary Schools Have Been Compiled</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air News) Since the central government promulgated the Outline for War Resistance and National Reconstruction in the 27th year, with the stipulation of adapting the teaching materials, the Ministry of Education immediately formed a textbook editing committee to first compile wartime supplementary teaching materials, and continue the unfinished work of the Ministry-edited textbooks. The main points of compiling wartime supplementary teaching materials for primary and secondary schools are: "In terms of politics", (1) clarifying national policies, (2) unifying will, (3) invigorating the spirit of long-term war resistance, (4) increasing students' understanding of the national conditions and the current situation, (5) mobilizing the people's strength; "In terms of teaching", (1) adapting the role (for example, the civics subject must pay special attention to the Three Principles of the People, the Plan for National Reconstruction, the Outline for National Reconstruction, the National Duty, the Recognition of the Nation and Ethnicity, the Political, Economic and Social Conditions of the Country, the Current International Situation, and the Relationship Between Our Country and Other Countries. The national language should appropriately select legends that promote national consciousness, national morality, and exemplary personalities in history who became benevolent and took righteousness as teaching materials. History and geography must focus on the domestic part. Foreign history and geography can be reduced appropriately. History teaching must pay special attention to the past glory, anti-Japanese national heroes, and the historical facts of Japan's invasion of China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 in the history of the country. Geography must pay attention to the evolution of the territory of past dynasties, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, the current national defense situation, and the recognition of the regions in each theater of war.), (2) supplementary role (supplementing what is insufficient, providing what is lacking, and changing what is modified), (3) unifying role, (4) counseling role. It is estimated that the wartime supplementary teaching materials compiled by the editorial office are limited to primary and secondary school subjects such as language and society. "In the middle school", there are Chinese, civics, history, and geography. "In the elementary school", there are Chinese, society, and common sense, totaling seven subjects. History and geography are limited to the country. The seven subjects compiled have selected wartime-related materials as teaching materials and have formulated 14 general outlines as follows: (1) Teaching materials related to the needs of the War of Resistance Period, (2) Teaching materials about historical stories of national heroes, etc., (3) Teaching materials about the situation of people suffering in various places during the War of Resistance Period, (4) Teaching materials about the situation of military and civilians resisting the war in various places, (5) Teaching materials about encouraging people to serve in the military, (6) Teaching materials about people in various places should respect and treat the wounded soldiers kindly, (7) Teaching materials about treating the families of soldiers on expedition preferentially, (8) Teaching materials about national defense, (9) Teaching materials about developing industries and increasing production, (10) Teaching materials about organizing and training the people, (11) Teaching materials about enhancing national consciousness and strengthening the national concept, (12) Teaching materials about supporting the government and leaders, (13) Teaching materials about enhancing scientific beliefs and improving the level of scientific knowledge, (14) Other teaching materials related to the Outline of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction,</p>
<h3>National Chongqing Merchant Marine College Registers Old Students in Shanghai</h3>

<p>In the senior singles of lawn tennis, Wang Wenzheng faced Lin Baohua in the semi-finals held at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon.

Therefore, after only a few games, he was defeated by Wang Wenzheng's powerful shots to the left and right, and he was easily eliminated with three sets of 6-3. Only in the third set did he manage to tie at 3-3, but then Lin lost three consecutive games. In another junior singles semi-final, Liu Nianxin lost to Oshima in three straight sets.

<h3>Finance: Calm Foreign Exchange Market; Cash Returning to Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash speculation market was calm. The foreign exchange trend was peaceful, and many accounts tended to take profits immediately when the price was high and buy when the price was low. Therefore, the market price fluctuations gradually returned to normal. The difference between the morning and afternoon was less than 100 yuan. The situation was weak at first and then turned firm. Initially, the loosening of foreign exchange caused selling, and many bulls, including gold shops, securities firms, and retail investors, came out, causing the situation to be quite weak for a while, falling to a low of 3,975 yuan. Later, as traders turned from selling to buying, and the foreign exchange returned to normal, plus Hong Kong firms entrusted a certain currency exchange firm to buy on their behalf, the price returned to above 4,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the price once rose to a high of 4,065 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop sold on behalf of a wealthy businessman, and retail investors also took profits, causing the price to fall back to 4,040 yuan at the close.

After the opening, a certain currency exchange firm absorbed well and gradually raised the price by 15 yuan. A certain currency exchange firm bought a total of 30 taels from cash gold shops and other firms for 4,035 yuan. At that time, news of the strengthening of foreign exchange caused retail investors to sell, and many bulls from gold shops (on behalf of speculators) and securities firms (on behalf of local firms) also came out, causing a sharp decline, falling by 55 yuan. Securities firms and silver shops sold a total of 40 taels to cash gold shops for 3,975 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop suddenly turned from selling to buying, and the market sentiment stabilized immediately, returning to 3,990 yuan. At that time, Hong Kong firms suddenly bought, entrusting a certain currency exchange firm to buy on their behalf, causing the market to strengthen further and break through the 4,000 yuan mark. A certain currency exchange firm bought 30 taels from silver shops for 4,010 yuan. Later, another currency exchange firm sold more than 100 taels, causing the price to fall back to 3,995 yuan at one point. At 11:20 AM, news of the foreign exchange returning to normal and the continued purchases from Hong Kong firms and the retail investors buying more than selling caused the price to rise again. Shortly after, the price increased by 25 yuan. Currency exchange firms traded 30 taels with each other for 4,020 yuan. At noon, the price fell slightly. A currency exchange firm sold 10 taels to the 　 firm for 4,010 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to a currency exchange firm selling on behalf of a customer and a gold shop also selling heavily, the market opened 20 yuan lower. A certain currency exchange firm sold 30 taels to other firms for 3,990 yuan. At that time, Hong Kong firms entrusted securities firms to buy on their behalf, and silver shops also bought, causing the price to rise sharply, soon increasing by 75 yuan. Silver shops bought 10 taels from a currency exchange firm for 4,065 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of pawnshops, tended to sell, and the rising trend was suddenly frustrated, falling back by 20 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to a currency exchange firm for 4,045 yuan. Later, securities firms bought more than 100 taels, once reaching 4,055 yuan. Later, as buyers' intentions turned weak, and retail bulls took profits, the price fell slightly. A gold shop sold 20 taels to a currency exchange firm for 4,040 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that after the close, a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop sold a total of 50 taels to currency exchange firms for 4,038 yuan. The fluctuations throughout the day were 90 yuan. The selling price of the current gold shops is 10 yuan higher than the speculative price. The current premium is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Transactions are rare.</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry in silver shops fell first and then rebounded.</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was still 410 yuan per tael at Datonghang. At 9:50 AM, it was reduced by 5 yuan. At 3:00 PM, it rebounded by 5 yuan. As a result, there was no change. The price at Datonghang was still 410 yuan. The price at Xinhanghang was still 408 yuan. The amount received was reduced by 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the pound was weak, pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 13th: Although the pound was weak, the published price of pure gold per ounce remained at £8 8 shillings, so the market prices of various central banks also remained unchanged. The buying price of Chinese cash remained at 1,370.09 yuan. The listed customs gold price was 2.707 yuan. The Shanghai standard premium price also remained at 1,366.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Becomes More Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was stable. HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange, the American exchange against the British exchange fell by another 2.875 points, resulting in a situation where the British exchange was stable and the American exchange was tight at the start of the morning. Initially, Huabao Bank and other banks continued to sell, resulting in a slightly weaker potential situation. The British gold was 4 shillings and 625 points, and the American exchange was 6.6875 yuan. Later, the Western firm Sassoon absorbed some, so the situation returned to normal at noon. The situation was more stable in the afternoon, with no changes. As a result, the British exchange was stable, while the American exchange was slightly tight. The futures for this month moved in the same direction. The market was still very ordinary that day, with low trading volume.</p>
<p>Sassoon Still Buying</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, London's large-volume, short-term price was 6,875 points, and the long-term price increased by 625 points. The New York silver price increased by 375 points. The London raw gold price remained unchanged. The British exchange against the US dollar, against Shanghai, and against France were all stable.

The central bank's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. The selling price of spot goods at the bank opening in the morning was 4 shillings for the British gold and 6.625 yuan for the American exchange, which was stable for the British exchange and tight by 0.0625 points for the American exchange compared to the previous closing price. This was due to the contraction of the British and American exchange rates. After the opening, the trend was peaceful, with no changes. When the HSBC's listed price was announced and did not change, and the silver balance tax was announced, the price increased sharply by 0.04 yuan. After that, Huabao Bank suddenly sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 0.3125 points and 0.0625 points to the foreign bank Maigali, and then sold spot American exchange at 6.65625 yuan and 6.6875 yuan to a certain bank of Datong. At that time, Yinghang Youli suddenly sold spot American exchange at 6.6875 yuan to a certain bank, so the situation appeared to be strong. Around 11:00 AM, the Western firm Sassoon suddenly bought spot British gold at 4 shillings 0.3125 points and 0.015625 points from foreign banks such as Huabi, and closed out spot American exchange at 6.65625 yuan and 6.625 yuan with a certain bank, so the market situation returned to normal.

<h3>The Decline in Japanese Gold Notes Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market was quite calm, and the price of gold fluctuated around 4,000 yuan, so there were no major fluctuations. However, the decline in Japanese gold notes continued. The market was still stable at the beginning, and the price remained firm at around 1.32 yuan. Then, the supply continued to increase, and the price gradually fell to 1.30945 yuan. As a result, it decreased by 0.0256 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Quiet Domestic Debt; Rubber Stocks Hit New Highs</h3>
<p>The bond market's sentiment was wait-and-see. Trading became increasingly thin. Most bulls were waiting for an opportunity to move, while shorts were still selling. Scattered retail investors slightly increased their positions after gaining some profit. Therefore, the market price did not fluctuate much. The price fluctuations in the morning and afternoon were only 0.05 yuan. The overall market price difference was between 0.05 yuan and 0.1 yuan. After the afternoon closing, there were rumors in the market that the Class C bonds had secretly broken through the 3 yuan mark. The overall result for the day was mixed.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Sales Slow, Speculators Sell and Re-mortgage Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>The yarn market is becoming increasingly volatile, but most people are optimistic, as there is no hope for a drop in raw cotton prices and various sources of supply are blocked. Bull traders are holding tight to their goods and refuse to give up. However, actual demand is shifting towards a slump, and Hong Kong buyers have already purchased large quantities, their capacity being limited. As a result, the spot market for 20-count Double Horse yarn is particularly weak. Those holding goods wish to raise prices, but reality prevents it. Consequently, some are selling off spot goods and moving them into warehouse receipts. Another account states that spot goods previously reached a high of 785 yuan and have already risen to 790 yuan, exceeding the previously decided price. However, the price of warehouse receipts is still 10 to 20 yuan lower than the previous decision, so there is a bullish outlook on warehouse receipts, and goods are being re-mortgaged.</p>
<p>The morning opening for raw yarn was lively, with prices rising again. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 784-785 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 690 yuan, both rising by about 10 yuan. Shortly after, news came that Guangdong buyers were not doing business and purchasing was even slower, causing a sudden drop. Double Horse spot prices fell by 12-13 yuan. By the close of trading, prices had recovered, with spot prices at 780 yuan and warehouse receipt prices at 695 yuan. According to half-day trading statistics, 1,530 bales were traded. Xinhe Factory opened with 50 bales of 20-count Special Five Sons yarn at 660 yuan and 50 bales of 32-count Pine Deer yarn at 780 yuan. Today, 25 pieces of yarn were shipped to Yantai. The quantities purchased by various buyers are listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 860 Hong Kong: 205</p>
<p>Inland: 405 Fuzhou: 10</p>
<p>Ningbo: 50 Total: 1,530</p>
<h3>Tianjin Factories Purchase Cotton in Shanghai for Northern Transport; Cotton Prices Rise Another 5-6 Yuan</h3>
<p>As for the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market opened in the morning with falling prices due to increased selling pressure from outside and arbitrage buying by southern buyers. Foreign cotton merchants also sold aggressively. The price of cotton fell and, by the close of trading, prices were down 16-17 points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been weak lately, with yesterday's prices, including forecasts, falling another 2 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points, and Liverpool cotton fell by 25 pence.</p>
<p>In spot cotton transactions, foreign cotton accounts for the majority. Although native cotton is appearing on the market, sources of supply are obstructed. Only Tongzhou cotton is arriving smoothly, while other varieties are as rare as unicorns and phoenixes. The Hua cotton business has suddenly diminished. Factories, aware of this trend, are constantly searching for foreign cotton. It is reported that the Hengyuan and Beiyang factories in Tianjin, North China, are also purchasing cotton in Shanghai for transport to the north. Given this situation, the cotton market is firm, and prices have risen by another 5-6 yuan. Approximately 1,050 bales of cotton have arrived from northern Jiangsu. The current situation for spot cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become even more lively recently, with prices reaching new highs, surprising all parties. It is expected cotton prices will continue to rise because the stock of goods held by traders is nearly exhausted, leading to extremely tight prices. Brazilian cotton has reached a new high price of 230 yuan, White Rock cotton is nearly 170 yuan, and West Indian cotton is over 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Special Tin Geng Reaches a High Price of 44 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhu Rice: No shipments are arriving from Hexia. It is reported that 15 shipments are on the way to Shanghai. More than 3,000 bags of wheeled bag rice from various places have arrived. People expect continued price increases, and sales in this market are quite good. Merchants are uniformly calling for higher prices, resulting in a slight increase of half a yuan for Gao Geng (glutinous rice) due to the high price of goods. The various Jian varieties continued to rise by about one yuan. Special Tin Geng is opening at 44 yuan, Gao is 42-43 yuan, next is 40 yuan. Su Tong Kun Geng is 42-40 yuan. Hexia early and late rice is out of stock and without a market. Original bags are opening at a high price of 40 yuan, settling at 38 yuan. Bian Yuan (literally "variable yuan", likely a type of rice) is selling well, also increasing by one yuan. Wuxi and other goods are opening at 36 yuan. Hong Kong glutinous rice is also opening at 36-35.5 yuan. New Jian Jiangbei goods are opening at 27.4-26.7 yuan. Chen Wu Jian is 27 yuan, and new Jian is 27 yuan. Jiaxing Kunshan and other new Yang Jian are 28-27.5 yuan. Trading volume is estimated to be no less than 7,000-8,000 bags.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: After rising and then leveling off the day before, the market opened yesterday with news that blocked rice boats had not yet been released, and that 2,000 bags of newly arrived Jiangbei new Xian rice had also been detained at Hongkou. Market sentiment immediately turned upward, and rice shops and retailers were extremely greedy, with prices of new and old Ke Xian rice rising sharply by about one yuan. The market remains firm. Yesterday, Jing Gao Xian reached 29 yuan, Jiangbei Xian was 27.5-26 yuan, and Wu Xian was 27.3-25.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour: Sales to Outside Customers Decline; Wheat Arrives Daily</h3>
<p>The current flour market situation continues to be stable. Factory prices remain at 7.2 yuan in cash, which is the retail price in this market. However, returned goods have become more sluggish than before due to cheap dumping by Japanese merchants, generally at 7.35-7.4 yuan. It is reported that Japanese factory goods are selling for only 6.7-6.8 yuan and can be exported, so some outside buyers are purchasing them. The future of local factory flour is inevitably affected. Yesterday, sales to northern and southern customers declined slightly, while stockpilers made some purchases. The price of foreign flour has been rising frequently at its source, and it has reached 8 yuan in Shanghai. The market situation is generally mixed. On the 15th, 16,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The supply of wheat remains abundant, with about 30,000 bags arriving. Shipments from Chuzhou and Wu Yi and other places have been arriving continuously, due to high prices attracting distant goods. Factories' purchases are gradually slowing down, and outside stockpilers are rarely inquiring. However, those holding goods remain firm in their intention to sell, so the market remains stable. A total of over 14,000 bags of wheat from Wuxi, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Chuzhou, Guandian, Dachang, Yangzhou, and Wuhu were offered for sale. In addition to 13,000 bags purchased by the Fu and Fu factories, the remainder was purchased by stockpilers. Prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>350 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 14th, and 4,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin on the 15th. In addition, 500 pieces of raw oil arrived from Qingdao on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Expected to Rebound Later</h3>
<p>According to a Dutch telegram, the price of coarse white sugar for immediate shipment is small ○.45, at 9.15 Dutch guilders. The local trade association's price assessment was weak in the morning due to continued selling by stockpilers. Spot goods initially fell by 3 yuan, with local warehouse goods at 57 yuan, but later rebounded to 58.3 yuan. Foreign warehouse goods were initially at 56-57 yuan, then rose to 57.5-58.5 yuan, ending only 0.5 yuan higher than the previous day. Re-export goods were down 2-1 yuan, at 45-46 yuan. Taikoo Che Bai (literally "car white", likely a grade or brand of sugar) fell 2.5-1.5 yuan, with B-mark at 62.5-63.5 yuan. The market thinned out later, showing signs of rebound. H-mark Che Chi (literally "car red", likely a grade or brand of sugar) was 45.5-46 yuan, and Dutch spot goods were 47.5-48 yuan, with re-export goods at 40 yuan. Local Mian Bai (literally "cotton white", likely a grade or brand of sugar) was down 2 yuan, with Zhen Ji No. 1 at 58 yuan, No. 2 at 57.5 yuan, No. 3 at 57 yuan, and No. 4 at 56.5 yuan. Local No. 1 Bing (literally "ice", likely a grade or brand of sugar) was down 1 yuan, at 67.5 yuan, and Jing Ming Bing was 69 yuan. Due to certain controls, Hainan Red National Sugar, known for its exceptionally high quality and excellent packaging, is definitely being purchased. Zheng Mian Chi is quoted at 60 yuan, but the trade is settling at 57.5 yuan. According to Jianbang (likely a trade association or specific group of merchants) news, transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu will be open soon, so Diao Qing sugar may arrive next week.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Red Jade Sea Cucumber is Offered, Asking Price is Extremely High</h3>
<p>The initial offering of new Red Jade Sea Cucumber is seen, and because costs are very high, the asking price is extremely high. Jade sea cucumber is as much as 70-80 yuan more expensive than in the spring. The details of the prices of each grade are published in the market price column.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Woolens Only Increase in Price, Never Decrease</h3>
<p>Woolens and woolen fabrics are increasing in price across the board, regardless of whether they are men's or women's colors and materials. Sellers holding stock are treating them as rare commodities. This is because the cost of foreign goods has risen sharply due to foreign exchange appreciation, and shipments arriving later will be even scarcer. The factory prices of local Shanghai-woven goods, such as the Ewo, Yinfeng, and Zhanghua brands, all exceed current market selling prices. Looking at the recent variety of woolen goods, there is a serious risk that what is sold today cannot be restocked tomorrow, resulting in a situation where the price of all goods only increases and never decreases. The market for winter-demand overcoat woolens is particularly strong and rising.</p>
<h3>Price Increase Statistics for August</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The price increases in August are a continuation of the tight foreign exchange situation, and the rate of increase is accelerating rapidly, with some prices even doubling. Undoubtedly, such an endless rise in prices is eroding purchasing power. Here, we simply compile statistics on the price increase notices published in the newspapers in August.</p>
<p>There were a total of 166 price increases in August, an increase of 14 over the 152 in July. The 166 price increases can be divided into 16 categories: food and beverage, clothing, medicine, printing and publishing, cultural supplies, transportation, candles and foil, fuel, electrical metals, cleaning and hygiene, cosmetics, packaging, daily necessities, decoration, paint, and housing. Among them, food and beverage ranked first with 48 items, daily necessities ranked second with 17 items, transportation ranked third with 16 items, electrical metals and clothing ranked fourth with 14 items each, medicine and printing and publishing ranked fifth with 11 items each, cultural supplies ranked sixth with 8 items, decoration ranked seventh with 7 items, cosmetics ranked eighth with 6 items, cleaning and hygiene ranked ninth with 4 items, candles and foil and fuel ranked tenth with 3 items each, packaging ranked eleventh with 2 items, and housing and paint ranked last with 1 item each. The goods and the percentage of price increases in each industry are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Shaoxing Wine: Whole bottle, Jing Zhuang (likely a brand) increased to 3.4 yuan, Fang Yang (likely a size) increased to 5.5 yuan, Jia Da (likely a size) increased to 14 yuan, Hang Shi (likely a size) increased to 9 yuan. Separately, Jin Tai Diao (likely a type of Shaoxing wine) increased by 0.8 yuan per bottle, Xiao Hua Diao (likely a type of Shaoxing wine) increased by 0.36 yuan per jin, Da Hua Diao (likely a type of Shaoxing wine) increased by 0.4 yuan per jin, Jing Zhuang increased by 0.32 yuan per jin (Shaoxing Wine Trade Association).</p>
<p>(2) Milk: Large bottle, 2 pounds, increased to 0.82 yuan, medium bottle, 1 pound, increased to 0.48 yuan, small bottle, 0.5 pound, increased to 0.26 yuan (Yuan Yuan Xing Ji Milk Company).</p>

<p>(5) Seasoning powder increased by 10-20% compared to the original price. The Tian Yi Wei mother factory in China increased by 10%, the Xiang Yuan Wei Zhi Jing factory increased by 15%, and the rest increased by 20% (Yi Hua, Dong Ya, Lao He Xing, Hua Xing, Tai Yi, Tian Hua, Xing Ji, Tian Fu China, Tian Yi China, Xiang Yuan, and other ten factories).</p>

<h3>Japan Convenes Meeting of Foreign Garrison Commanders, Seeks to Alter Foreign Military Zones; Commanders Express No Opinions; General Hedrick Rushes Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, the Japanese Naval authorities in Shanghai suddenly invited the British, American, and Italian commanders of the Shanghai garrisons to a meeting at the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in Hongkou. Those attending included British Major General Simmons, International Settlement Commander Hongbei, American Major Fegan, and Italian Major Vival. Invited to attend as observers were Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Secretary-General Felippu, Chief of Police Bowen, and a French military representative. The Japanese side was represented by the commander of the Japanese Naval Forces in Shanghai and Shanghai Garrison Commander Sakurai. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. Western reporters inquired with the Japanese naval spokesperson about the content of the meeting, but the spokesperson stated, "Under orders, I am not allowed to reveal the reason for the meeting," but added that the meeting was "very important." According to reports from the Da Zhong News Agency, the meeting convened yesterday morning was to discuss adjusting the garrison territories of the various foreign forces in Shanghai. Therefore, the SMC Secretary-General, Chief of Police, and the French military representative were also invited to attend. However, there had been no prior contact between the foreign commanders and the Japanese side. During the meeting, the Japanese side suggested adjusting the defense zone of the Shanghai concessions. One foreign commander questioned how this adjustment would be made. The Japanese side did not provide a definitive answer at the time, only stating that a concrete plan for the adjustment would be submitted in writing to the foreign commanders in a few days. According to foreign sources, the Japanese side presented a simple but confidential plan, one aspect of which was most related to the British military zone north of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Meeting Convened to Present Plan</p>
<p>According to an Associated Press report from this city on the 14th, the Japanese Naval authorities in Shanghai convened a meeting today with the commanders of the British, Italian, and American garrisons in the city to discuss revising the current defense plan for the International Settlement. The French military authorities in Shanghai also sent a representative to attend as an observer. The Japanese side stated at the meeting that the current defense plan for the International Settlement was drafted in 1931 and revised once in 1934. This plan was designed to defend against unfavorable actions by the Chinese towards the concessions. Now that this threat has been removed by Japan, the current defense plan is obviously no longer suitable for use. The Japanese requested the commanders to express their opinions. As none of the commanders offered any suggestions, the Japanese side announced a brief recess.</p>
<p>Admiral Hepner to Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>However, after the recess, no suggestions were put forward. Therefore, the Japanese side had to declare the meeting closed. However, as the commanders were leaving, they indicated that the issue was open for discussion. The date for a renewed meeting has not yet been set. It is also reported that Admiral Hepner, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has suddenly left Qingdao and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (i.e., today). It is feared that this is related to the Japanese proposal this morning.</p>
<h3>Two Conclusions Announced by the Japanese</h3>
<p>According to a statement yesterday afternoon by the Japanese naval spokesperson in Shanghai, the meeting of the commanders of the foreign garrisons in Shanghai this morning reached two conclusions: (1) All parties unanimously agreed that the current defense plan for the International Settlement needed to be revised. (2) All parties agreed that the Japanese Marine Corps should draft a revised draft of the defense plan for the International Settlement as a basis for future discussions. According to the spokesperson, the Japanese side had no demands or concrete suggestions, and only wanted to discuss the fundamental principles of defense.</p>
<p>Britain, America, and Italy to Consult on Countermeasures</p>
<p>According to another report, when the Japanese Navy convened the meeting of the Shanghai garrison commanders yesterday, the Japanese naval representative stood up to state the reason for convening the meeting, saying, "The Shanghai garrison deployment plan was drafted in 1931 and revised in 1934. Since the Shanghai environment has changed, this plan should be revised. The garrison plan was established to prevent the Chinese side from invading the concessions. Now that this threat has been removed by the Japanese military, we should discuss and revise the plan." As for how it would be adjusted thereafter, the Japanese side did not immediately propose it at the time, but asked the commanders of the various countries to offer suggestions. However, the representatives made no indication. The Japanese military then announced a recess. After a while, the meeting was reconvened, and the representatives still made no suggestions. However, the British military leader acknowledged that it was possible to revise the garrison plan and announced the closure of the meeting. During the recess, the leaders of the British, American, and Italian garrisons exchanged opinions and agreed that the military staff of each country should meet to discuss and find a solution to revise the garrison plan. The date of the first meeting of the joint staff meeting has not yet been decided. The Japanese military, upon hearing the news, requested to participate in the meeting for open discussion. The foreign military leaders indicated that they would continue to discuss with the Japanese side after the military staff of each country had agreed on a plan.</p>
<p>Hepner's Arrival in Shanghai Attracts Attention</p>
<p>Admiral Hepner, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet, had only recently returned to Qingdao from Shanghai when he suddenly boarded the fast ship USS Isabel yesterday and rushed to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive today. This unexpected move has attracted considerable attention. Admiral Hepner was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the flagship USS Augusta at the end of this month. He received a telegram from Shanghai, hence this trip.</p>
<p>No Progress in Shanghai West Negotiations</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, negotiations between the Japanese Municipal Council and the Japanese Consulate regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries are ongoing, but with no progress. It is reported that one party to the negotiations is the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and the other party is the Japanese Consulate. The content of the negotiations is being strictly guarded as a secret, and no release is allowed for the time being. SMC Chairman Fankling returned to Shanghai from Beidaihe yesterday morning and immediately went to the SMC to resume work, presumably because the serious situation in Shanghai requires his urgent return to preside over the response.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Closely Cooperate to Respond</p>
<p>According to a business leader familiar with the situation of the SMC, who met with a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday, the focus of the concession issue is now on the United States. With Britain and France occupied with affairs in Europe, the United States has control of the decision-making power regarding the status of the Shanghai concessions. Its every move can truly influence everything. At a time when the Japanese military has begun to attack the concessions with force, US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull issued statements at a reception for reporters, "Opposing any attempt to change the situation in the Far East by force." The implications are self-evident. It is now known that the consuls of Britain and the United States are maintaining close contact and have had repeated meetings regarding the negotiations over road construction beyond the boundaries, proving that the authorities of the two countries in Shanghai are determined to cooperate and respond to this situation. Most reprehensibly, the negotiations on this issue of road construction beyond the boundaries have historically been very complicated. When Wu Tiecheng was mayor, his secretary-general Yu Hongjun and former SMC director-general Feixindun repeatedly resolved the results of the negotiations, which were on the verge of resolution. For example, the police power and taxes of road construction beyond the boundaries had already been formulated with specific measures. However, due to the lack of sincerity of the SMC, our side failed. In the past, the SMC delayed in handing over the police power of road construction beyond the boundaries to the Chinese government. Now, it has begun negotiations with the Japanese side, intending to make concessions to a puppet government that has not been recognized by the world. I fear that this will add another stain to the history of British diplomacy.</p>
<p>Situation in Shanghai West is Tense and Relaxed by Turns</p>
<p>A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency patrolled the Shanghai West area again last night. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Replenishment of Defense Has Never Been Interfered With</p>
<p>The giant building at No. 448 Haig Road (west end of Difeng Road), after being occupied by Japanese military police and puppet police on the 13th, the family of the owner, Mr. Lin, had completely moved out yesterday. Four puppet police are still stationed in front of the main gate, and another door has been opened to the west of the main gate, which is wider than the original main gate. More than ten Japanese and puppet police are now working hard to build it. It is speculated that its purpose is to provide a watchtower for the Japanese military police. Regarding this action by the Japanese and puppet police, the police department has not been heard of any response measures.</p>
<p>Japanese Officers Occupy Civilian Houses</p>
<p>At the No. 31 Reception Center of the Cilian Branch at No. 11 Jessfield Road, four puppet police were still stationed in front, and most of the Japanese and puppet police stationed inside were transferred elsewhere yesterday, leaving only ten people. Yesterday at noon, a Japanese officer opened the room of the director of the reception center without permission and had a meal in the room. At that time, the wife of the director came from outside and suspected that a refugee on duty had opened it without permission, and scolded her face to face. The sound was heard by the Japanese officer, who was immediately furious and planned to drive out the director and others. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<p>British Soldiers on Guard on Yu Garden Road</p>
<p>Six puppet police are still stationed in front of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank staff dormitory at No. 1760 Jing An Temple Road. The Japanese military police and puppet police coming and going are still frequent, but there is no change. At Siming Villa, Zhongshi New Village, and Qianjia Lane opposite Yuguang Village on Yu Garden Road, there are two puppet police stationed at the entrances, and the situation is the same as the day before. Near Zhaofeng Park, plainclothes puppet police occasionally inquire about the names and populations of residents, but no other unfortunate incidents have occurred. Two British soldiers with guns are stationed in front of the giant building at No. 769, which attracts the attention of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Part of the Puppet Police Has Been Withdrawn</p>
<p>Puppet police are still stationed at the intersection of Kangjiaqiao and Jinjia Lane. However, the puppet police stationed in the area of Kangjiaqiao Jinsitu Temple have been withdrawn. The fortress in front of the west district command of the Japanese military police at Malu Bridge (intersection of Kena Road) is still under construction yesterday. The sandbags in front of the puppet police branch were being rebuilt yesterday, and a awning was added on top.</p>
<p>Setting Up Telephones, Armed Patrols</p>
<p>In the Caojiadu area, along Robinson Road, Japanese engineers were busy setting up military telephones on existing telephone poles from military trucks. The Japanese military police and puppet police were also frequently traveling back and forth on military trucks. Armed puppet police were still patrolling in formation on various roads, but the freedom of residents has not been violated yet.</p>
<h3>Japan Attributes All Actions to "Self-Defense," Claims Every Treaty Includes Self-Defense, Disregards US Statement</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that when the Japanese side entertained reporters yesterday (the 13th), one asked whether there were any indications that Japan would take the self-defense measures it was requesting in the Nine-Power Treaty. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy replied that this depended on future developments.</p>
<p>Inability to Predict Future Events</p>
<p>The spokesman went on to say, regarding US Secretary of State Hull's statement that the United States would oppose any unilateral attempt to use force to eliminate American rights in China and the Far East, that it was not possible to say at this time what events would occur here in the future. This issue involves international law, but every treaty contains the right of all parties to take self-defense measures.</p>
<p>Disregards Hull's Statement</p>
<p>The "Manchurian Incident" was a prominent example of Japan invoking this right, as is the current Chinese "Incident." The Japanese authorities are now disregarding Hull's statement because the United States has held this attitude since the "Manchurian Incident." The United States' non-recognition of "Manchukuo" is in accordance with its position of not recognizing the unilateral use of force by other countries to change any treaty. The right of self-defense is recognized by leading American jurists in general, such as Supreme Court Chief Justice Hughes, who believes that the right of self-defense is "stronger than the treaty itself."</p>
<p>Vague About Tense Situation</p>
<p>One questioner asked whether the Japanese side felt there was any reason for the United States to reiterate its previous statement at this time. The embassy spokesman replied that the US authorities may believe that the general situation in Shanghai and the Far East is very tense. One questioner asked whether the spokesman also believed that the situation in Shanghai was "very tense." The spokesman gave a vague answer, saying that it was purely a matter of degree, and that opinions differed on the degree of tension.</p>
<p>Japanese Policy of Individual Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the use of the term "unilateral," the spokesman said that the Japanese government has a firm policy of not engaging in discussions or negotiations with other countries to resolve various issues related to China. For example, the Tianjin issue was discussed only between Britain and Japan because it involved Britain. The Japanese government adheres strictly to the policy of discussing only with the British those issues that concern them. The spokesman reiterated the Nine-Power Treaty, emphasizing that the meaning of the right of self-defense is not to eliminate, but to amend. The Kellogg-Briand Pact stipulates that the relevant countries have the right of self-defense. Japan's resort to "self-defense measures" does not conflict with the Pact.</p>
<h3>German Merchants Not Discriminated Against</h3>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the European Second War, the ships of the German Rickmers Line's Shanghai branch, which traveled between Germany and the Far East, were completely suspended, and business plummeted. Coupled with the high rent in Shanghai, the company moved yesterday from its original location at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession to No. 620 in the International Settlement in order to reduce its scope and save expenses. It was rumored that the company's decision to move was due to friendly advice from the French Concession authorities. The German Consulate General declared to a Da Zhong News Agency reporter yesterday that this statement was not true and that the French Concession authorities had never advised German merchants to move out of the French Concession.</p>
<h3>The Smokestacks of Warring Nations' Ships Repainted Black</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the ships of the warring nations have been under the command of their respective navies. The ships of the British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire in this city were once prevented from sailing by the navy but resumed operations the next day. However, the Chinese and English ship names and flags on both sides of the ships have been painted over. It has recently been reported that the smokestacks of Jardine Matheson's ships, which are red, have also been repainted black. The blue smokestacks of the Blue Funnel Line's ships will also be repainted black. The smokestacks of Butterfield &amp; Swire's ships are black, so it is unknown whether they will be changed in the future.</p>

<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's promulgation of the Outline of Measures for Consolidating Finance, it stipulated that banks should be urged to actively handle savings deposits in accordance with laws and regulations, and invest their savings in productive enterprises. In addition, it promulgated the Regulations on National Savings Bonds for Promoting Thrift, designating the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau to issue them in two types, A and B.</p>

The savings bonds are divided into six denominations: five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan, and are available in both registered and bearer forms.</p>
<p>The weekly interest rate is 6 to 6.5 percent. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired yesterday at the Shanghai branches of the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau of the Central Trust Bureau, etc. regarding the commencement of the construction of national savings bonds. They will proceed in accordance with the orders from the head office/bureau, etc. The accounting of their issuing banks/bureaus is independent, and in addition to the assets invested in savings deposits as the first</p>
<p>guarantee reserve and being directly responsible to the depositors by the issuing banks/bureaus, the safety of their principal and interest is guaranteed by the government. The use of the savings deposits will be in: (1) productive enterprises related to national defense; (2) land reclamation and construction of water conservancy to develop agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry; (3) development of industry and mining; (4) transportation undertakings; (5) joint production and marketing undertakings; (6) other construction undertakings related to the economy. The investment in each of the aforementioned undertakings must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>The General Association of Charity Unions Will Soon Close Down, The Number of Refugees the Difficult Shelter Can Hold is Full, Further Measures Will Be Considered After Building New Houses</h3>
<p>The United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations for Disaster Relief Committee for Refugees in War Zones (hereinafter referred to as the General Association of Charity Unions), located within the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road in this city, was established during the August 13th Shanghai Battle and has been in existence for over two years. At its peak, the association housed over 100,000 male and female refugees, with over 60 shelters. Recently, the number of refugees has gradually decreased, and the shelters have been making every effort to merge and close down. Currently, there are only 14 shelters, housing a total of 18,711 refugees. Recently, due to various reasons, there have been reports that the association will soon close down. A "Liquidation Committee" has been established and is currently meticulously discussing the resettlement of these more than 10,000 refugees. Once a proper solution is found, the General Association of Charity Unions will be closed down. In addition, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has announced that all shelters are full of refugees and, in addition to finding new empty land to build houses, has specifically notified various charitable organizations that they will stop accepting refugees from today. Further arrangements for accommodating refugees will be considered after the houses are built.</p>
<h3>A Hurricane Has Arisen Again in the Pacific Ocean, It is Still Far from Shanghai and Its Course is Unclear, The Huangpu River Will Experience High Tides Starting Today</h3>
<p>According to news from the Observatory, a new hurricane has formed over the Pacific Ocean. However, it is currently far from Shanghai, so its direction and trajectory are unknown. In addition, the Huangpu River experienced a high tide at midnight this morning, and there will be another high tide this afternoon, which will continue until the 20th before returning to normal. During the high tide period, shops and businesses in low-lying roads must not relax their flood prevention efforts to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>The Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Bowen, Denies the Allegation of Exclusively Employing Japanese, Anyone with Competence Can Fill Important Positions, The Nationality of the Person is Not Considered</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Bowen, denied yesterday (the 13th) that he had said he intended to recruit "capable Japanese" to fill vacancies left by the British and did not intend to hire people from other countries, as reported by the Japanese "Continental News." However, he stated that the rest of the report was true. According to the "Continental News," a reporter from the newspaper visited Bowen on Tuesday and asked about the British and Japanese police officers in the police department. Bowen replied that there was no deliberate discrimination against the Japanese. Anyone with the ability to properly perform the duties of the position can fill important positions, regardless of the person's nationality.</p>
<p>The Police Department Follows the Board's Opinion</p>
<p>Regarding the regulation that allows British police to use hand-held machine guns but prohibits Japanese police from using them, he believes that it is not discrimination, but a matter of procedure. It is now planned to train Japanese police to use these weapons. The reporter asked about the attitude of the "Municipal Government" towards the request to manage roads outside the Settlement. Bowen said that this issue is very important and he cannot answer immediately. The attitude of the Police Department will depend on the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Council, not on his personal opinion. The Police Department will follow the policy determined by the Shanghai Municipal Council and is responsible for maintaining the policing power of the roads outside the Western District.</p>
<p>Hope for Cooperation from the Japanese</p>
<p>Bowen also stated that he knew nothing about the maintenance costs of the four-line isolated army in the detention camp of the Public Concession, or the seizure of German property in the Public Concession by the British authorities. The peace and order of the Public Concession should be maintained, which is the common responsibility of all countries that make up the Concession. In view of the current "dark situation" in Europe, he hopes that the Japanese will actively cooperate to maintain the peace and order of the Public Concession. No friction has been found between the British and Japanese in the Shanghai Municipal Council, and everything seems to be proceeding smoothly. He also hopes that the British and Japanese will cooperate with each other on issues that affect the general problems of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Although the War Has Begun in Europe, Donations for China Relief Have Not Decreased, It is Expected that Various Countries Will Donate Enthusiastically Next Month, Flood Victims in Various Places Urgently Need Assistance</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that a reporter met yesterday (the 13th) with several people who have been engaged in relief work for a long time. According to their views, although the war has begun in Europe, it is still expected that various countries will continue to provide economic assistance in the middle of next month to carry out relief work throughout China. They do not believe that the relief funds donated will be reduced because of the resumption of war in Europe. It is reported that several groups are now redoubling their efforts to raise funds to pay for relief work in China. One of these groups is the American Church Committee, which raised more than US$250,000 for relief funds in China last year and is currently conducting a fundraising campaign for US$1 million to be used for relief next year. According to a member of the American Relief Fund Committee in China, even funds from the United Kingdom will not be completely stopped. According to the committee's recent communication with the British office, the council believes that the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations can be expected to continue to donate</p>
<p>However, the amount must be smaller than last year. According to the British relief fund donations, the Mayor of London initiated the fund, originally named the London Mayor's Fund. Later, the scope of the group was greatly expanded and received donations for relief funds in China throughout the United Kingdom. Canada and Australia are major donors in the British Commonwealth of Nations. According to well-informed sources, the two Commonwealth of Nations will continue to work hard to raise relief funds in China. The only foreign relief group here that will end its affairs in a month or two is the American Relief Civilian Committee in China organized under the auspices of the American Red Cross. Yesterday, a senior member of the committee stated that the US$200,000 sent by the American Red Cross will soon be exhausted. It is expected that the American Red Cross will not re-allocate funds here. According to a relief worker, a large amount of funds will be needed this year. There are floods in North China, one-third of Hebei Province,</p>
<p>and 12 million people who have become impoverished and in urgent need of relief. As winter approaches, the Yellow River will continue to flow south from the breach. It is expected that the areas most affected will be the Huai River basin in Anhui and northern Jiangsu. In addition, there are millions of people who have become impoverished due to the war. If the Japanese army launches a large-scale invasion in October, the number of displaced people will inevitably increase greatly. The American Church Committee is now handling relief matters and is most satisfactory. Most of the relief funds are raised in the United States.</p>
<h3>The Rice Merchants' Association Decides to Start Selling Rice at Controlled Prices Tomorrow, The Specified Time Will Last Until All Rice is Sold, Preparations at Five Locations in the Two Concessions Have Been Completed</h3>
<p>After more than 18,000 bags of foreign rice ordered from Saigon by various groups such as Yu Qiaqing arrived in Shanghai, 10,000 bags were used to relieve refugees and 8,000 bags were used for selling rice at controlled prices. The Rice Merchants' Association was entrusted with the handling of the sale of rice at controlled prices. After the association appointed personnel to each of the locations for selling rice at controlled prices, all preparations have now been completed. A meeting of the committees for selling rice at controlled prices was specially convened at 3:00 pm yesterday, attended by Zhang Nianxuan, Pan Jibin, Lu Wenshao, Qu Zhenhua, Shi Hongxun, Cheng Bingzhang, Huang Ruyuan, Ge Peiyuan, Chen Shaolian, Xia Tongfu, Su Boxun, Jiang Qiusheng, etc. Zhang Nianxuan chaired the meeting, reported on the preparations in each location, and decided to start selling rice at controlled prices from the 16th of this month. The time is from 8:00 am to 11:00 am and 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm every day, until all 8,000 bags are sold. All measures will be handled in accordance with the agreement previously reached with Yu Qiaqing. In addition, it was decided that the meals of the personnel selling rice at controlled prices and all necessary documents during the period of selling rice at controlled prices will be announced by the association today so that the public is aware of them. It is also heard that the total number of foreign rice ordered by the group has reached 12,000 bags as of yesterday. It is scheduled that the initiators, Yu Qiaqing, etc., will convene a meeting of all those who ordered the rice this week to discuss the ordering method, and there is also a proposal to request more foreign exchange to expand the scope of selling rice at controlled prices.</p>

<h3>Raw Materials for People's Livelihood and Daily Use and Industry are Specially Allowed to be Imported and Transshipped, Special Permits Must Be Obtained, Divided into Special Use and Commercial Sale, Goods Ordered in the Past and in Transit Are Also Permitted</h3>
<p>After the promulgation of the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Periods, 234 tariff rules, such as luxuries and non-essential goods, are uniformly prohibited from import or transshipment. As for the articles for the people's livelihood and daily use or raw materials belonging to the industry, it is allowed to apply to the Ministry for a special permit to allow import and transshipment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry Orders Special Permission to Import and Transship</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Director-General of Customs, stating that if the foreign goods that have been embargoed were indeed ordered or shipped before the promulgation of the embargo order, or the goods transshipped are articles for the people's livelihood and daily use or raw materials belonging to the industry, which are needed in various parts of the rear, and the foreign exchange has been raised for the prices of the goods, it may be allowed to submit documents to the Ministry in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Measures for Applying for Import Permits for Items Prohibited from Import during Extraordinary Periods and to apply to the Ministry for the issuance of import permits to report and transport the goods for import. If the transported goods cannot be submitted for inspection of the import permit, they should still be prohibited from import. The customs offices in various places have been ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Regulations on Applying for a Special Permit</p>
<p>Divided into two types: special-use permits and commercial sale permits. (1) Special-use regulations: For government agencies to regulate the market prices in the rear, they must purchase or entrust businesses to purchase certain embargoed items on their behalf. Government agencies, private organizations, and individuals have a real need for embargoed items for scientific, industrial, medical, health, charitable relief, educational, and cultural purposes. (2) Commercial sale regulations: Sugar, kerosene, gasoline, etc. The purchaser should first clearly state the type, name, brand, and country of import and quantity of the goods to be transported. After the Ministry has reviewed and approved them, a special permit will be issued.</p>
<h3>Unified Class C Public Bonds, Regular Lottery Draw, Bonds Due at the End of the Month Will Be Paid, However, the Telegraph Administration Public Bond May Be Delayed</h3>
<p>The public bonds due at the end of September include, in addition to the Jin Chang type, which the Four Banks have agreed to discount, and Shanghai will pay in six installments of remittance bills. (1) The 24th Year of the Republic of China Telegraph Administration Public Bond, issued in October of the 24th year, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan in national currency. This will be repaid 400,000 yuan in 16 installments. (2) The Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bond, issued in October of the 25th year, with a fixed amount of 12 million yuan in national currency. This will be repaid 2.4 million yuan in 6 installments. (3) The Guangdong-Hong Kong River Dredging Project US Dollar Public Bond, issued in April of the 16th year, with a fixed amount of US$2 million. This will be repaid US$40,000 in 5 installments. The above three types of payment methods will be announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications. It is heard that the Telegraph Administration may be delayed. As for the public bond to be drawn for repayment of principal at 10:00 am on October 9th, it is the Unified Class C Bond of the 25th year of the Republic of China, with 8 draws totaling 2.8 million yuan for repayment of principal. The payment date is January 31st of next year. As for the Shanghai Coupon Market (i.e., the black market), because the government's maintenance of bond credibility has remained unchanged, it has gained the trust of bondholders. Therefore, the purchase is booming, and the prices of unified bonds are becoming more stable, with ups and downs of only 5 cents to several corners.</p>
<h3>British Warship Intercepts a Japanese Ship, The Japanese Side Expresses, No Intention to File a Protest</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that when the Japanese side entertained reporters yesterday (the 13th), or asked about the reported interception of a Japanese ship by a British warship near Taiwan, the Japanese authorities had already filed a protest with the United Kingdom. A Japanese naval spokesman replied that warships of belligerent countries have the right to intercept ships of neutral countries on the high seas during wartime. The Japanese side has never and does not intend to file a protest. Since the United Kingdom has declared war, Japan recognizes the right of the United Kingdom to intercept ships of neutral countries on the high seas and search for contraband in accordance with international law. However, considering that the place where the Japanese ship was intercepted is very close to Taiwan, and there are no German territories or ports nearby, British warships may not have a great necessity to exercise their rights.</p>
<h3>The Fake Side's Tax Revenue, Friction is Increasing, The "New Government" Does Not Cooperate</h3>
<p>Since Shao Shijun was appointed as the "Director of the Three Provinces Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" under the control of the Japanese side, he has extorted various taxes, and the amount is very large. The "New Government" believes that the bureau is not subject to the control of the "Ministry of Finance" and has been unusually wrangling against it. In recent months, the friction between the two sides has been increasing. According to a certain source obtained by the reporter, the "New Government" has now decided to adopt a non-cooperative approach and regards all "branches" set up by the "Tax Bureau" in various places as illegal, saying that they have not been approved by the "New Government." On the one hand, it also ordered the people not to pay taxes to the "branches" set up by the "Tax Bureau." If they pay taxes, they will be punished. Therefore, the merchants and people in the inland are at a loss for a while and do not know what to do.</p>
<h3>Cases of True Cholera are Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently reported that according to a report from the Chief of the Health Department, the average number of cases of true cholera in the Concession is three per day in a certain week, which should be considered an epidemic. The above average number of cases is consistent with the standards set by the Concession, but in terms of the number of residents in the Concession, it can be said that the number is not large, and the reported number of daily occurrences has in fact gradually decreased. From this, it can be seen that the cholera situation this year is still mild and has only just reached the level of an epidemic.</p>
<h3>British Ships Transport Grain to Tianjin, The Water in Tianjin Dries Up and There is Panic About Food, Special Transportation of Flour and Miscellaneous Grains for Relief</h3>
<p>Tianjin is the center of the Northern Ocean route and the commercial center of North China, so the business communities of various countries attach great importance to it. Since the "July 7th Incident", the business of foreign businessmen in North China has been greatly affected, and shipping has also been hit. In July of this year, the British Concession in Tianjin was blockaded by the Japanese army, causing British ships to be unable to transport goods to Tianjin. Later, it was slightly eased, and suddenly there was a major flood, and shipping was suspended. It has been nearly a month. It is heard that the water level has slightly receded recently, but there is extreme panic about food there. Today, a British ship went to Tianjin, transporting more than 16,000 bags of flour and more than 4,000 bags of miscellaneous grains such as beans, which is the first shipment of goods to Tianjin by a British ship after the flood.</p>
<h3>Italian Postal Service Ship Seeking Profits and Raising Firewood, No Longer Coming to Shanghai, Conte Biancamano is Scheduled to Return to Europe on the 24th</h3>
<p>The Italian Postal Service ship Giulio Cesare has been in Shanghai for half a month and started to raise anchor and return to Europe yesterday morning. The ship originally came to Shanghai this time to replace the Conte Rosso's schedule, so it will not come again next time. In addition, the company's Conte Biancamano came to Shanghai from Genoa on the 12th of this month and docked at the Gonghexiang Pier in Hongkou. Passengers and cargo have been unloaded. According to the schedule, it should have returned to Europe yesterday. Since yesterday's schedule has been operated by the Giulio Cesare to return to Europe, the ship must be slightly delayed in Shanghai. This morning, it sailed to the Wusongkou for temporary anchorage, and it will return to the pier on the 21st to load cargo, and is scheduled to depart for Europe on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Various Factories and Groups Send Wang Gongquan to Nanyang</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the source of imported goods has been scarce, and it is the time for the development of the national goods industry. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Products Factory Federation, and the Shanghai Mechanized National Products Factory Federation have taken this into consideration and specially sent Wang Gongquan to Singapore in Nanyang to investigate the national goods industry. He set off on the Chinina Mail ship yesterday (14th). Wang Gongquan is the assistant manager of Tianxiang Yubao Factory and is a well-known figure in the national goods industry.</p>
<h3>The Achievements of the Special Service Brigade of the Wuxi West District Self-Defense Force</h3>
<p>According to a visitor from Wuxi, Zhou Hanliang, the captain of the special service brigade of the Wuxi West District Self-Defense Force, gathered strong men and organized a people's self-defense force since the fall of Wuxi. The authorities specially appointed him as the captain of the brigade. Zhou deeply believes that the responsibility is great and there is no complacency in his mind. A Japanese envoy named Hu Jugen, led the Japanese army to Bai Village in April and May to spy on the Chinese military situation. As a result, three of Zhou's friends were killed and seven were captured alive. However, Hu was still not satisfied and recently went to Bridge to inquire about Zhou's whereabouts, but did not gain anything. Later, Zhou heard about it and was very angry. On the night of "August 13th," he led his team to Beicang to take over the Tingxinji opium den. Hu was playing the Xiao and stopped the drinking. Zhou then ordered to fire and killed Hu. Also last month, Zhou led his team to attack the Japanese troops in Luoshe. Seven Japanese soldiers were killed and two were injured. Zhou's side sacrificed team members Ma Tianxiang and Wang Wenzhong, and injured Han Qingshan. Recently, Zhou joined forces with the regular army of the 52nd Division and destroyed four or five miles of highway near Meiyuan. In addition, Jiang Liuchun, the pseudo-district chief of Kaiyuan Township, illegally organized a district office, relied on his power to bully others, forcibly issued more than 20,000 good citizen certificates, and levied a strong field tax with cruel means, causing the people to live in misery. Zhou heard about it and sent a team to arrest him. It was originally intended to escort him to the higher authorities, but Jiang thought he had no face to see anyone and committed suicide by drowning himself in a water tank. Also last month, the Huazhong Company organized by the Japanese and puppets transported a boat of silkworm cocoons, worth 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. On the way through Shuanghe, it happened that Inspector Cao was sent by the higher authorities to track down and went to Zhou's team to burn them all. Zhou has recently been encouraging his troops to attack and control the city at any time.</p>
<h3>The Zhenjiang Association Opposes the Construction of Houses for Rent at the Yizhong Cemetery</h3>
<p>The Lüban Road Jingjiang Association's Tuyang Yizhong Cemetery in the French Concession has more than seven acres of land. Recently, the association suddenly engaged in picking up bones and reburying them, intending to build houses for rent. The Zhenjiang Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the association and related groups yesterday, expressing its opposition and suggesting that it be rebuilt into schools or hospitals and other public welfare undertakings. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, After investigation, the Tuyang Yizhong Cemetery on Lüban Road in the French Concession has more than seven acres of land. After several disputes, it has been barren for a long time and it is a pity to abandon it. Those who know it are sick of it. Fortunately, the elders have spared no great effort to rectify it, pick up bones and rebury them, and gradually become clear. The construction of houses and the handling of public undertakings are actively underway. I admire the elders' enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the villagers. However, it was recently heard that someone suggested that the base be used to build houses for rent to generate profits. The news came as a surprise. Tuyang Yizhong was originally established by the sages of our village for the public welfare of the villagers in Shanghai and has been in existence for decades. Now that we are using this barren base to relocate the old tomb, it still seems appropriate to carry out public welfare undertakings, which is not only worthy of the dead, but also benefits the living, and is particularly important and in line with the spirit of the sages who established the Yizhong in the past. However, there are thousands of public welfare undertakings, and we have to distinguish between priorities. I think that the most urgent needs at present are two, and I will briefly describe them as follows. Please take note of them: (1) Since our village fell two years ago, no less than hundreds of thousands of villagers have come to Shanghai to seek refuge. The education of our villagers' children cannot be solved due to economic limitations. The number of out-of-school youths is large. If this continues, it will not only be a loss to our village, but also a great hidden worry to the country. Therefore, it is an urgent task to set up schools to educate the children of our villagers. Now that the elders have moved the Yizhong Cemetery, how about using the base to build a school to accommodate out-of-school youths from our village free of charge? Moreover, raising children and teaching them is the most important task at present, and cultivating talents is also a happy event in the world. The elders support education and love the youth, and I am sure they will be happy to agree with this proposal. This is the first. (2) There are many hospitals in Shanghai, but most of them are commercial in nature, and ordinary people often cannot get their benefits. Among the villagers in Shanghai, there are more small and medium-sized villagers than other籍, and I often see them concealing their illnesses and refusing to seek medical treatment, which eventually leads to major problems that cannot be cured. The reason for this is that medical treatment in Shanghai is expensive, and it costs several yuan at a time. Ordinary people are struggling to make a living, let alone seek medical treatment. It is estimated that countless people have died because of this, and it is a pity to let them die. If we can use the Yizhong Cemetery's base to build a large-scale hospital to provide free medical treatment for the poor villagers, then saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda, and benefiting the people is something that the elders are willing to advocate. This is the second. The above two items seem to be able to choose one to implement, so that all villagers in Shanghai can benefit from it. As for the expenses for opening and construction, although the amount is large, the Zhenjiang groups in Shanghai can be responsible for raising funds, so that everyone can work together to achieve success as soon as possible. Moreover, after checking, this place has always been the land of the Yizhong Cemetery for many years. If it is now rebuilt into houses, I am afraid it is not appropriate. It is better to use it to build public buildings such as schools or hospitals, which seems to be more appropriate. Moreover, building houses for rent is no different from profit-making, and I am afraid it will repeat the mistakes of the Jingjiang Association in the past, which I think will not be adopted by the wise elders. If this happens unfortunately, our association will not dare to agree for the sake of the villagers' interests and will be in an opposing position. I am sincerely worried, and I offer my humble opinion in the hope that it will be adopted and implemented. I look forward to it very much."</p>
<h3>New Development of Mardi Motor Company, New Repair Station and Showroom Open</h3>
<p>The American-owned Mardi Motor Company, in order to improve service efficiency, has added the Packard and Flier automobile repair station and showroom at 640 Foch Road, which has now been completed and opened today. Mr. Mardi, the general manager of the company, expressed his feelings, saying that the Mardi Motor Company, relying on the cooperation of his colleagues, has developed from a small-scale company to an automobile company with a sound organization and the best service efficiency after 19 years of hard work. He hopes to continue to work hard and move forward with the spirit of service that he has had in the past. The new showroom of Packard and Fliers is magnificent in architecture and luxurious in decoration. The offices in various places are neatly arranged, and the seats are extremely comfortable. However, what is unique is the new repair station. Its scale and equipment are not only the best in Shanghai, but also comparable to those in the United States. The latest testing and repair machines and high-pressure lubrication machines, etc., are amazing in their ingenuity. Mr. Mardi is also proud of this, and said that all human errors can be avoided in the future. In the past, testing and repair were based on guesswork or experimentation. Now, the most sophisticated machines are available, based entirely on science, so the work is better, the time is shorter, and it is more economical. The company's Chrysler and Windmill showroom is located at the corner of Sichuan Road and Edward Road, the repair station is located at 408 Pushi Road, and there is also an assembly yard at 115 Daxi Road.</p>

<h3>Pseudo Commander-in-Chief Han Jun Shot and Fled, Two Suspects Arrested, Gunman Still at Large</h3>
<p>Han Jun, a Shandong native currently stationed in Caohejing Town, Xuhui, as the "Police Brigade" Commander-in-Chief of the so-called "Shanghai Special Municipality," is 53 years old. Originally from the military, on June 22nd of this year, he took his beloved concubine, a woman from Yangzhou, and rented apartment number 39 in the Lushan Apartments at number 7, Lane 313, San Yi Li, Julai Road, French Concession (east of Rue de Sainte-Marie). Han used the pseudonym Zhang Yuntao, registering it in the apartment's circular register and guest card, and has been staying there for over two months. He travels by car daily, and has many visitors. However, the other residents of the apartment were unaware of Han's status as a rising star, and mostly paid him no attention. Yesterday, at 11:15 AM, Han, wearing a gray silk long gown, left the apartment with two friends, walked out of San Yi Li Lane, and arrived in front of the Yuan Chang Porcelain Shop at number 210 across the street. As he was about to step into the car parked there, a man wearing a white undershirt and black silk pants suddenly rushed out from the roadside and shot at Han with a pistol, firing four shots in quick succession. Several other people were acting as lookouts. Han was shot twice in the back, on the left and right sides, but still managed to escape into the car. His chauffeur drove off at full speed, heading west. The San Yi Li gatekeeper, hearing the gunshots and seeing what had happened, immediately blew his whistle to summon the patrolmen. However, the gunman and the lookouts fled in different directions, east and west, amidst the whistle blasts. Several patrolmen bravely gave chase in both directions. At the corner of Avenue Albert, the gunman managed to escape, but two suspects were apprehended. One of them had been shot in the shoulder. They were taken back to the police station for questioning. Han's concubine, who was staying in the Lushan Apartments, disappeared after the incident. The police sent detectives to guard the apartment. After a while, Wang Jun (44 years old), a Jiangbei native who claimed to be Han's adjutant, arrived, unaware of what had happened. He addressed Han as Commander-in-Chief, and was subsequently taken to the police station by the detectives for questioning. Because the victim had disappeared, the French police contacted all hospitals, but found no trace of him. It is rumored that Han, badly wounded, sought treatment at a Hongkou hospital. The French police are currently sending detectives out to investigate the cause of the shooting and to apprehend the perpetrators for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Morphine Den Uncovered</h3>
<p>The detective chief of the Xinzha police station recently received a tip that a morphine trafficking operation was being conducted at number 45, Meixingli, Lane 714, Jinjiazhai, Chengdu Road, selling heroin and other drugs. Yesterday (the 14th) at 4:30 PM, he secretly dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They apprehended a Mai woman selling morphine and a buyer in the stove room of the house, and also found a large bag of morphine. They were all taken to the police station for detention and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Morphine Criminal Sentenced</h3>
<p>Xin Yujing and Li Guoxing from Shandong recently engaged in secret morphine injections for profit at number 20, Yuanfangli, East Broadway Road. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 6:00 PM, detectives from the Huishan police station discovered this and arrested Xin and Li at the address. They were quickly sent to the First Special District Court along with 36 small packets of morphine. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced Xin Yujing and Li Guoxing to twelve years of imprisonment each, and the drugs were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Sold into Bondage, Pimp Organized Gang Kidnapping, Pimp and Accomplices Arrested After Reporting to Police</h3>
<p>Li Fengying, a woman from Taizhou, is currently 20 years old. In May of this year, she was sold for 150 yuan into a brothel run by Xu Yan, a woman from Taizhou, at number 38, Siming Inn, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, to work as a prostitute for a term of two years, with a contract signed. From then on, Li fell into the abyss. Every night, Xu Yan would send her to the Great World amusement park to solicit customers. However, a Shaoxing man named Shi Chengrong, who worked as a tea server foreman on the eighth floor of the Great New Company rooftop garden, frequented Xu Yan's establishment and became acquainted with Li Fengying. They fell in love at first sight and promised to marry each other. They then discussed a plan to redeem her. On the 5th of this month, Shi paid 150 yuan to Xu Yan to redeem Li and they moved into a rented house to live together. At around 9:00 PM the night before last, Shi, Li, and a woman named Sun Wang went to the Mingxing Theater on Park Road and Qingdao Road to watch a movie. Upon exiting, they were suddenly ambushed by Xu Yan and a dozen others, who had hired a car to wait. As soon as Li Fengying appeared, they rushed forward, snatched Li onto the car, and sped away. Shi reported this to the Xinzha police station, who dispatched detective Yang Peizhang, together with detectives from the French police, to number 38, Siming Inn, where they arrested Xu Yan and found Li Fengying in room 54 upstairs. They were all taken to the police station. Subsequently, Yang Axiang, a Suzhou native, was arrested at number 123, Shanhai Pass Road. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit according to the law, stating that accomplices Bao Tingyu and others were still at large and requesting a postponement. After a brief interrogation of Li Fengying and the defendants Xu Yan and Yang Axiang, the presiding judge ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Case Continued for Further Review: Bicycle Shop Owner Rapes Young Girl, Shameless Couple Arrested</h3>
<p>Lu He, a young woman from Jiangbei (17 years old), residing in room number 8, number 93, Lane 1173, Seymour Road, had a relationship with Ji Xilin (29 years old), a Shanghai native who owned the Diefei Bicycle Shop at number 113, Route Cardinal Mercier. Despite already having a wife and children, Ji was still having an affair with Lu. Ji, known for his lustful nature, was not satisfied and asked Lu to find him a virgin to satisfy his desires. Lu's roommate, Ju Guangtao, a Yangzhou native, had a daughter named Xiuying, who was only 14 years old and had not yet experienced intimacy. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month at 8:00 PM, Lu lured Xiuying to room number 119, Andong Inn, number 131, Hubei Road, under the pretext of taking her out to play. Ji soon arrived and attempted to rape Xiuying, but because of her young age and incomplete development, Ji was unable to achieve his goal. However, Xiuying sustained injuries to her lower body. After being threatened by Lu and Ji, Xiuying did not dare to say anything when she returned home. It was not until the day before yesterday that her mother, Ju Chen, discovered bloodstains on her daughter's pants and questioned her. Xiuying finally revealed the truth. Ju Chen then confronted Lu and reported the incident to the Laozha police station. Detective Xue Youwen arrested Ji and sent Xiuying to the hospital. The examination confirmed that her lower body had been sexually assaulted three weeks prior. Yesterday morning, Ji and Lu were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed charges of rape under Article 231 of the Criminal Law. Judge Feng Shide announced that the hearing was closed to the public and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Chen Weida's Home Robbed, Masked Robbers Identified by Maid, Shop Clerk from Broadway Mansions Arrested as Suspect</h3>
<p>The home of Chen Weida, a wealthy Shanghai businessman and Catholic believer residing at number 13, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, was broken into by four robbers wearing visored caps on the morning of the 6th of this month at 7:30 AM. They stole cash and valuables worth over 1,000 yuan and fled the scene. Chen reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation. On the afternoon of the 12th at 5:00 PM, Chen's maid, Wang Abao, was out shopping and encountered Shao Zuoting (28 years old, short stature), a Ningbo native working as a shop clerk at number 11, Broadway Mansions, Broadway Road, at the tram stop at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Vegetable Market Road. She identified him as one of the robbers present at the scene. She cried for help, and Shao was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court and requested to be detained for investigation and further questioning. Chen Weida, accompanied by his daughter Chen Bangqian (22 years old) and the maid Wang Abao, appeared in court. According to Wang, the first three robbers had already gone upstairs, and she could not clearly identify them. However, she was very clear about the defendant. "He pushed me into the young lady's room, pinned me to the bed, pressed a pillow over my face, and threatened me with a knife. At the time, he was wearing a visored cap," she stated. Shao Zuoting testified that he worked as a shop clerk at Broadway Mansions. That afternoon, he went to his relatives' house at number 5, San Yu Li, to see his wife. Because his wife was out and his relatives were women taking a bath, and the room was small and not suitable for waiting, he went outside and waited at the tram stop when he was identified as a robber. He claimed to be clueless and requested a thorough investigation. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Miao ordered a postponement until the 23rd for further questioning and ordered Shao to be detained.</p>
<h3>Bi Haomin Accused of Brandishing Gun to Intimidate Bank Employee Over Property Seizure</h3>
<p>Zhang Lingyun (23 years old, Wuxian native), an employee of the Yongcheng Bank at number 241, Zhonghui Building, Avenue Edward VII, recently hired lawyer Sun Shi'an to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Bi Haomin (29 years old, Zhejiang native), the younger brother of jockey Bi Haoqing of the Pao Ma Ting, who owns the Bide Xing Raincoat Company at number 35, Rue Lupan,</p>
<p>Accusing him of using a gun to intimidate and coerce him into performing an unlawful act, and requesting his arrest and prosecution. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff worked at the Yongcheng Bank in Zhonghui Building. On the 4th of this month, the bank filed a lawsuit to recover a debt, and the court ruled to seize the movable property in the house at number 1310, Ma Jili, owned by the debtor Mao Wenlong, for sale as collateral. However, at 2:00 PM that afternoon, a man claiming to be Li Linshu, accompanied by the defendant, arrived and claimed that the house had been leased from Mao by Li,</p>
<p>And should not be sealed. They demanded that it be unsealed immediately. The plaintiff asked where Mao Wenlong had moved to, but the defendant replied that he did not know, only the address of Zhang Yimei, the witness for the lease transfer. He demanded that the plaintiff go with him to inquire about Mao's address. However, after leaving the bank, the defendant forced the plaintiff into his car and drove him to the Tongren Law Firm on Beijing Road, where he took out blank legal papers and forced the plaintiff to sign an order to unseal the property. The plaintiff refused under the pretext of resisting, and returned to the bank. Shortly afterwards, the defendant brought Zhang Yimei to the bank, demanding that the property be unsealed immediately. The plaintiff explained that if the seizure was erroneous, there were legal remedies, and he could not rashly sign the unsealing order under duress. Upon hearing this, the defendant became enraged and, without regard for the circumstances, pulled out a pistol and aimed it at the plaintiff's chest, threatening to shoot him and kill him if he did not unseal the property immediately. Fortunately, Li Linshu and Zhu Huimin, an employee of the British Embassy, were present and, fearing a major incident, dragged the defendant out, preventing any harm from coming to the plaintiff. The defendant's act of using a gun to intimidate and force him to sign the unsealing order constitutes a violation of Articles 204 and 305 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Wu Kechou summoned him for questioning yesterday. After the plaintiff recounted the incident, the defendant hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Xiao Zichuan from the Tongren Law Firm to defend him. He testified that he had a gun, but did not take it out to intimidate the plaintiff. After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered the defendant to post bail and postponed the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yu Shunqing Commits Murder Out of Shame and Rage, Charged with Murder</h3>
<p>Yu Shunqing, a 57-year-old Jiangbei man who runs a food stall at number 424, Haifang Road, is elderly and nearly blind, and prone to suspicion. His daughter-in-law is somewhat attractive and has a frivolous nature. She often flirts with Zhou Zhaifang, a Ningbo native who runs a steamed bun shop across from the tiger stove. Yu Shunqing mistakenly believed that they were having an affair and became extremely angry, wanting to take drastic action to quell the rage in his heart. At 4:30 AM the day before yesterday, taking advantage of Zhou's sound sleep, Yu Shunqing, wielding a kitchen knife, rushed into the steamed bun shop across the street and, without regard for the circumstances, attacked Zhou, mistakenly injuring his nephew Zhou Haosheng in the face. As a result, Zhaifang was also stabbed in the head and back, and cried for help. Detectives from the Gordon Road police station arrived after hearing the alarm, arrested Yu Shunqing, and took him and the kitchen knife to the police station for detention. The injured Zhou Zhaifang and his nephew Zhou Haosheng were taken to the Majiong Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the suspect Yu was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, filing a public prosecution based on the charge of attempted murder under the Criminal Law. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing until the victims had recovered from their injuries.</p>

<h3>Film and Theater Impressions and More (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>—As Told by Movie Star Lu Luming—</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Lu Luming is known as a "Fitness Star," and is dedicated to both stage and film arts, with many years of tireless effort, not favoring one over the other, a truly commendable dedication. In recent years, her fame has overflowed the art scene, gracing both the stage and screen, showing a clear and outstanding presence. Yet, she remains humble and eager to improve. With such a professional attitude, her future is undoubtedly limitless.</p>
<p>I am a deeply passionate lover of film and theater. Six years ago, I came to Shanghai from the North and entered the film and theater industry. Although I have acted in many stage plays and films, I still consider myself a small student. I work hard and carefully in my daily acting work, only aiming to improve. My sole purpose is to succeed in becoming a true actor.</p>
<p>Brief Personal History</p>
<p>My ancestral home is Guangdong Province, but... I grew up in Shenyang. My father was a construction engineer and was always working there, until I was nine years old, when we moved to Tianjin, where we lived for ten years. During this time, I studied for many years at a local church school called "Sacred Achievement." Unfortunately, my father passed away suddenly when I was fifteen years old, leaving behind my mother and me!</p>
<p>Past Experiences in Film</p>
<p>Thinking back on my past experiences in film, almost ten years have passed without realizing it. I remember that in 1930, the Lianhua Film Company opened its fifth branch in Beijing and was recruiting actors. At the time, I was filled with enthusiasm for film and went to apply. Fortunately, I was accepted and began studying at their training school. The director of the school was the senior dramatist Mr. Hou Yao. There were over a hundred male and female students, including Ms. Bai Yang (then known as Yang Junli), Ms. Liu Li, and Mr. Yin Xiucen (the fat one), all of whom were my classmates. The training period was set for six months. We had daily classes and also busily filmed a movie called "New Grievances in the Forbidden City" as a practical exercise. Now that I think about it, it's really funny. The movie had only outdoor scenes; there were no indoor scenes at all—because, apart from one camera, there was no other equipment. Every day, a group of us filmed on Longevity Hill under the scorching sun, applying thick makeup on our faces. Our skin was painfully sunburned. It was really pitiful. "Is this what making movies is like?" We had never even seen a studio or lighting. Everyone was just working hard without really understanding what was going on. Later, after the six-month training period ended, "New Grievances in the Forbidden City" was completed, and Lianhua's fifth branch was immediately closed down. It just dissipated like clouds and wind and disintegrated.</p>
<h3>"China Film" Another New Film "Sons and Daughters of China" Completely Filmed</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>—Premiering in Chongqing Soon</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the Central Film Studio moved to Chongqing, it has faced difficulties in transporting materials, inconveniences in purchasing foreign currency, and rainy and foggy weather that hinders outdoor filming. As a result, several new films in production have not been completed on schedule.</p>
<p>Although "China Film" is in this predicament, through the hard work of the director and staff, "Orphan City Dies in Blood" has already been completed. The story of this film narrates the heroic deeds of General Yao Ziqing in defending Baoshan City to the death. It shares the same subject matter as the China Film Studio's "Blood Splattered on Baoshan City" by Situ Huimin and can be compared to it. It was screened in three cinemas in Chongqing in May of this year, attracting huge crowds and great praise. The film has now been transported to [unclear], checked one by one, and is ready to be screened in [unclear] soon.</p>
<p>After completing "Orphan City Dies in Blood," "China Film" happened to experience [unclear] in various places, which delayed the arrival of foreign film stock. All of "China Film's" existing film stock had been used up, and work was forced to temporarily halt. Recently, new film stock has begun to arrive steadily, and work has actively resumed to complete the unfinished projects.</p>
<p>The new film following "Orphan City Dies in Blood" from "China Film" is "Sons and Daughters of China" by Shen Xiling. This film is a historical war film that includes heroic stories of Chinese sons and daughters participating in the resistance war.</p>
<p>The first segment depicts the brutal acts of the [unclear] invasion of China and the actions of simple [unclear] people participating in the resistance war. Starring Zhao Dan and Wang Ping.</p>

<p>The film began production [unclear]. Outdoor filming was greatly [unclear] until it was recently completed [unclear]. After [unclear] it will be [unclear] soon.</p>
<h3>Hukwang to Show "Aviation Hero"</h3>
<p>— Another New Soviet Film</p>
<p>The veteran Soviet directors rarely release new works these days because they are taking on the task of training and guiding new directors. For example, we have rarely seen new works from Eisenstein, Pudovkin, etc. Even if they produce a new film, they will definitely use an assistant director to give the younger generation a chance to learn. Pudovkin's new work, "Aviation Hero," is being assisted by Torer.</p>
<p>The sequel to "Peter the Great," which was originally scheduled to be shown at Hukwang, has reportedly been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. Pudovkin's "Aviation Hero" will be shown first, starting on the 16th of this month. This film showcases the strength of the Soviet air force and the government's attention to the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Stalin and Molotov also play a role in this film. They are seen shaking hands with the aviation heroes at a welcome reception.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the theme of this film also illustrates that great achievements are made by ordinary people, and great people are nurtured by ordinary people.</p>
<p>Following "Sunrise," the Lafai Theater's "Wild" has also encountered special curfew regulations in the concession. Therefore, it plans to only show daytime performances starting on the 16th, with nighttime performances being suspended.</p>
<h3>Casual Sketches of the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan</p>
<p>(15) Spoken Drama</p>
<p>The difference between spoken drama and Peking opera is like the difference between Western painting and traditional Chinese painting. Peking opera is about conveying the spirit, while spoken drama is closer to realism. In Peking opera, things like "Farewell to the Kiln," "Visiting the Prison," "Closing the Door," and "Riding a Horse" don't necessarily have to be real, but they must be expressed through gestures and movements. Spoken drama is not like that at all. It's a real performance, not a substitution. Therefore, when it comes to genuine and moving moments, Peking opera cannot compare to spoken drama.</p>
<p>The predecessor of spoken drama was "Civilized Drama."</p>
<p>Statement: This piece should have been switched with the "Civilized Drama" (16th) published on the 10th. Readers should take note.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Story of Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun</p>
<p>Zhang Xun saw that his subordinates were so united, and that they couldn't bear to part with the long braid left over from the Qing Dynasty (all of Zhang's soldiers had long, loose braids, usually covered with black gauze), he knew that they were all expressing their sympathy with him. That's why he boldly dared to go north. But when he decided to lead the entire army away from Xuzhou, Zhang Wensheng was deeply afraid that his teacher would be deceived this time, so he advised him not to go, not to take risks. Who would have thought that the ill-fated Kang the Sage would persuade the Braided Marshal to be convinced, thinking that with such a talented person planning strategies, how could he be deceived? Therefore, he ignored him and took all the officers out of the east gate of Xuzhou and boarded the train. Seeing that he was determined to leave and could not be dissuaded, Zhang Wensheng asked to stay behind to guard Xuhai and other places, and strongly requested that half of the army be divided and placed under his command to secure the important base. Who knew that Zhang still would not listen, and scolded Wensheng while ordering the train to start. At this time, seeing that there was nothing he could do, Wensheng lay across the tracks in front of the train, preventing it from starting, and wept bitterly, begging him to leave half of the soldiers in Xuzhou. No one could lift him, and the Braided Marshal himself came to drag him, but he would not budge. The two scolded and dragged each other, entangled endlessly. In the end, he agreed to Wensheng's request, ordering him and Bai Baoshan to each guard Xuzhou and Hai in the name of garrison commanders, dividing half of the army to them. Only then was the Braided Marshal able to set off. Later, although the restoration failed, and the Braided Marshal fled into the Dutch embassy in the Dongjiaomin Lane, the government authorities did not dare to publicly resolve the issue of him and his entire Anwu Army, because his old troops were still stationed in Xuhai. Afterwards, they first promoted Zhang Wensheng to Governor of Anhui and transferred him away from Xuzhou. Chen Diaoyuan was then ordered to use swift, unexpected methods to disarm the infantry led by Chen Dexiu overnight, incorporating the more elite troops into Chen's army, and Chen took over as the garrison commander of Xuzhou. In this way, the once-dreaded Braided Army all cut their braids and disappeared, which shows that Zhang Wensheng was not only the Braided Marshal's scolding friend, but also his great benefactor.

<h3>Let Everyone Have Some Food</h3>
<p>— Liu Lang</p>
<p>After reading the declaration of the "A Bowl of Rice" campaign by Mr. Roosevelt, President of the United American Relief Association for Chinese Refugees, a multitude of feelings arose, and I felt compelled to speak out.</p>
<p>Americans are willing to eat one less bowl of rice to save our Chinese refugees. However, looking back at Shanghai, the wealthy not only refuse to eat one less bowl of rice but also snatch the rice of many others to feed themselves alone. Despite the steady flow of rice into Shanghai, rice prices continue to rise. Many people have already been forced to give up their rice bowls and turn to making flour, which they are not accustomed to. But flour prices have also soared, forcing many more to become refugees. We can imagine that the bellies of the wealthy are becoming exceptionally full, while the people are becoming increasingly hungry and weak. We seem to see the wealthy opening their bloody mouths to suck the blood of the poor, and we seem to see people lying starving in the streets.</p>
<p>In Mr. Roosevelt's declaration, he also noted the importance of medicine for refugees. How could he not? Young masters and mistresses living in garden villas often feel aches and pains and regularly take good tonics; therefore, it is to be expected that refugees cramped in refugee shelters, which resemble black hells, would suffer from a multitude of diseases. Originally, refugee shelters, due to financial difficulties, could only be perfunctory in dealing with the minor ailments of refugees. Naturally, it is common for minor illnesses to turn into major illnesses, and for major illnesses to lead to death, but "financial difficulties" are ultimately "understandable." But now? With the outbreak of the European war, the wealthy see the opportunity to get rich from the First World War returning, and they are all vying to buy foreign goods, especially Western medicine, because taking medicine when sick is inevitable, and even if medicine prices skyrocket, they are not afraid that patients will not buy it, so profits are guaranteed. Therefore, although Western medicine stocks are sufficient, they are hoarding and speculating, and some medicines are difficult to obtain even at high prices. For the wealthy, who have plenty of money to buy medicine, they naturally don't care. But for those in the middle and lower classes, it is very difficult to get sick; as for refugees, they can only sit and wait for death.</p>
<p>As for using the excuse of refugee relief to exploit and profit from it, it is also a common occurrence. But look at Mr. Roosevelt's declaration for the "A Bowl of Rice" campaign: "All proceeds from this "A Bowl of Rice" campaign will be used for Chinese refugees, and the association's office expenses will not be paid from the donations." How can this be compared to our great philanthropists who organize relief groups to place relatives and friends, falsely report expenses, and pay salaries in name only!</p>
<p>Although these phenomena are colorful, they can be summarized in only one point: the wealthy hate the poor! The reason is simple: the poor are not only of no benefit to them but also harmful to them (such as the harm to their freedom from kidnapping). Therefore, the death of refugees (or the poor) is deserved! If they all die, they can live and work in peace. As for whether the poor are impoverished because they are exploited, or whether they can still obtain cheap labor after the poor die, and whether their products have a large outlet, they are too impatient to think about it. If anyone sees Mr. Roosevelt's second "A Bowl of Rice" campaign, they will definitely want to respond; in fact, it is unnecessary. First, in such chaotic times, almost everyone has trouble feeding themselves, how can they eat less? Second, the wealthy are unwilling to eat less. Third, the establishment of an association only adds a new expense.</p>
<p>Simply put, let's beg the wealthy masters not to steal other people's food, and let everyone have some food!</p>

<h3>Electric Light (Poetry Talk on Machinery)</h3>
<p>— Ru Hui</p>
<p>While sorting through old newspapers, I inadvertently found a news item in the "Shen Bao" of September 30th, Guangxu Year 8 (1882), entitled "Prohibition of Electric Lights." The content stated that the use of electric lights in this port had been reported by Dao Xian Shao Inspector to the English Co-Trial Officer Chen Prefect, who had found that there were several Chinese merchants using them and requested instructions for handling the matter. Chen Prefect had ordered the constables to notify each household with the local security guards to prohibit electric lights to avoid accidents. It is said that the shopkeepers also felt that electric lights were not suitable for use, so they all complied with the order.</p>
<p>Looking at it now, this is certainly an amusing incident. But at that time, the sea ban had only recently been lifted, and China had just come into contact with Western civilization. The Chinese people's surprise and apprehension towards the "monster" of electric lights was also understandable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of some poems about "electric lights" at that time. The most wonderful one is found in Volume 1 of the "Flower Cluster Tower Poetry Collection" attached to the "Zi Lin Hu Bao," in the "Shen Jiang Miscellaneous Poems" by Sao Lu Shan Ren: Electricity turns light into a work of nature, Shining red on the streets at night, New travelers are greatly surprised, How can the bright moon be in the rain?</p>
<p>People who saw electric lights for the first time, looking at them from afar, thought they were a bright moon, but because they were in the rain, they couldn't help but be suspicious. This satire is quite humorous. This is just like the later cartoonists depicting a villager lighting a dry tobacco pipe on an electric light, just as interesting. Ye Wenqin's "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Words" also has a poem with a similar artistic conception to Sao Lu Shan Ren's poem: The sea market clearly shows a sleepless sky, Electric lights and gas lights compete in beauty, It's hard to recognize the round moon, No need to say tonight is the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>At the same time, Su Kanghou's "New Shanghai Bamboo Branch Words" also says: No need to hold candles in this scenic spot, The round pearl is brighter than the moon, Why waste money to buy it, A city that never sleeps opens on the sea.</p>
<p>From these three poems, we can all see how people at that time looked at "electric lights" with surprise. But why is this so? There is no understanding at all, only surprise. However, it is not that no one understands. This can be seen in Wu Rongsen's "Three Poems on Current Affairs," one of which is "Electric Light": Newly made silver lamp shines brightly, Low-hanging electricity glows brightly, Burning flowers compete with the Hengchun tree, Entering the room is like a city that never sleeps.

<h3>People Content to Live in Hell</h3>
<p>— Weakling</p>
<p>One night, I returned home close to midnight. In this slum area on the edge of the French Concession, it was rare to see dim lights within a hundred steps. Fumbling into my own home, I lit a wax candle on the table, and looking at my shadow reflected on the wall, I suddenly felt like I was living in hell. My heart, which had been calm for a long time, could not help but be filled with thoughts like tangled hemp; but just like tangled hemp, with a thousand threads and ten thousand strands, I didn't know where to start. Suddenly, I heard a faint conversation outside the window. Who, of those who work at sunrise and rest at sunset, would still be wasting their precious sleep time?</p>
<p>Outside the window of the bedroom was the end of the alley. I looked out through the crack in the window and saw two dark figures curled up in the corner of the wall. In between them, a wax candle was burning. By the faint light, I could see clearly that they were rag pickers from the alley. But at this late hour, they still had the mood to chat, unaware that after dawn, they would not be able to sleep peacefully in this free lodging. At the same time, I chuckled at myself, why was I also wandering alone in my humble room? But since the demon of slumber had been driven away, I might as well light a cigarette and have a long night's talk with them, separated by a window.</p>
<p>I leaned closer to the window, and when I saw clearly what they were doing, I almost bled from my eyes. — These two homeless people, whose lives were not guaranteed, were burning and smoking a potent drug over the flame...</p>
<p>The surrounding area of the "Isolated Island" has been surrounded by a poisonous mist, and this soft aggression policy is killing an unknown number of people! It is admirable that the concession authorities are making every effort to clear the spread of this poisonous flame, but people who do not cherish themselves are throwing themselves into the net. — Even these two homeless people whose lives are not guaranteed!</p>
<p>Dawn is approaching, let these people who are content to live in hell perish under the sun!</p>
<h3>Two Draft Letters</h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Respectfully, Feng has recently resigned from teaching at school and returned to her old profession, studying Chinese medicine, in order to settle her body and mind after the myriad calamities. As the poem says:</p>
<p>Not because I love the blue mat for its purity, I entrust myself to simple writings before death, I eat my own labor for more than half a hundred years, I close my door and tire of thanking the worthies of the time.</p>
<p>My party is irrelevant, and I am also wasted talent, Circling the branches, I regret not choosing, I endure hunger and seek union to go to immortality, Treading the island, I sing and go back and forth.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Blue Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning with Medicine to Create Scholars is Like an Itch; Thinking Extensively, Saving and Curing to Entrust Children to Something</p>
<p>Now Dr. Lao Tong has a new plan. She traveled to the interior of China last year, to provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi. Dr. Lao Zhang is a devout religious person, and their church has branches everywhere in the interior of China, all establishing hospitals of a religious nature. Therefore, Dr. Lao Zhang is not afraid of not being entertained when she goes to the interior. But when she went there to see, the sanitation facilities in the interior of China were really too poor. Local sanitary administration has only been slightly improved in recent years, and before that, it could be said to be equal to zero. Although the people in the churches in the interior have also run several charitable hospitals, they are really very simple. In several secluded counties, they don't know what sanitation is called at all. In some places, it is difficult to see the water surface all year round, and the people do not know how to bathe. In some places, it is said that a person only bathes twice in their life. The first time is when they are just born, crying as they fall to the ground, and take a bath; the second time is on the night before they get married, and they also take a bath. Apart from that, there is never a day to bathe, even after death, they only wipe the body, (no need to bathe.) Sure enough, the water in that place is precious, and the people's cultivation of inertia is also a reason, right? Moreover, the people's ignorance and stubbornness is also the biggest obstacle. Just take one place in the interior that Dr. Lao Zhang went to. Seeing girls of seventeen or eighteen walking, they still walk with that kind of unsteady gait. Looking at their feet again, they all have some deformities, because they were all bound from childhood. Thinking that Chinese women have been unbinding their feet for fifty years, how can there still be girls of seventeen or eighteen with bound feet? In fact, the interior of China was isolated from the outside world in the past. In the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, girls with bound feet have long disappeared, but in those inland areas with closed customs, little girls still have their feet bound at the age of five or six. What is most ridiculous and lamentable is that in some places near the Yi Miao, the Yi Miao women walk barefoot, not binding their feet. But Han women mostly bind their feet. When asked about the reason, they think that the Han are noble and different from the Yi Miao, so they must bind their feet. This kind of ignorance and ridiculousness continued until five or six years before Ding Chou, when the Ministry of Interior sent many female staff members to various places in the interior to investigate. In any place where there are women under the age of ten with bound feet, the local officials will be punished, and the parents of that family will also be guilty. All those who have been bound are forced to unbind them all. But those girls, pitifully, had their foot bones broken by their ignorant and cruel parents. Although they are liberated, walking is still somewhat different. (182)</p>
