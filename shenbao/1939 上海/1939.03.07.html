<p>社評</p>
<h3>論達拉第外交</h3>
<p>法國社會黨昨天開會，該黨要人前內政部長陶爾謨曾就達拉第政府現行外交政策，猛烈加以抨擊。陶氏大聲疾呼的說：「龐萊外長所推行的政策，乃係屈辱的政策，一方面足以削弱法國之地位，但一方面仍不免導法國於戰爭之途，結果所屆，徒供法國在更不利之條件下應付未來戰爭耳。」默察目前國際形勢和法國所處的地位，陶氏這幾句話實是對達拉第政策的「一針見血」的批評，是値得法國每個人士深切沉思的。</p>
<p>法國所處的地位，還有再比今天危險嗎？自從慕尼黑會議以後，捷克淪爲希特勒的附庸，波蘭羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫等都有離心的傾向，法國二十年來所經營的小協約衛星綱，差不多完全破碎，法國原已處於孤立的地位。可是達拉第政府郤還是追隨張伯倫，對西班牙繼續採取「不干涉」政策，終至意，德，在西班牙勢力日增，陷西班牙政府於窮蹙的境地，而伊比利半島的火焰，也終於逼近了法蘭西的邊境，這時候，達拉第政府竟索性跟着英國承認弗朗哥了。現在，我們翻開地圖一看:東面雄踞着希特勒，東南角睨視着墨索里尼，而西南又出現了意德的傀儡弗朗哥，法蘭西已緊緊受三面的包圍了。</p>
<p>法蘭西政治家常常拿「意德法西斯不足畏」的話來安慰人民，但墨索里尼於去年五月就已在熱諾亞明白承認「法意在西班牙是對立的。」達拉第等郤輕輕忽略了這句話的嚴重性，並且毫不注意德意軍火源源接濟弗朗哥的事實，而只是輕描淡寫的對人民說：「不干涉政策是可以保衛和平的」。現在，我們終於要看到他們所造成的惡果了。</p>
<p>慕尼黑會議沒有帶來了和平，這連主角張伯倫也在無意中承認的。要不然，他爲什麼還要在下院中口口聲聲說着「如果戰爭發生，英國將站在法國的一邊」呢？法國巴結法西斯的外交，顯然是建立在烟雲般的希望上面的。達拉第之流打算着，法國如果犧牲了中歐和東南歐的利益，她也許更易於保衛殖民帝國的利益。</p>
<p>老實說，法國的歐洲利益和它的帝國利益分不開，因爲法西斯侵略是分不開的。法西斯的侵略中歐，只不過是實現更大規模的侵略和分割的初步階段罷了。</p>
<p>法國不僅在北利紐斯邊境遭到了法西斯陣綫的威脅，在菲洲，甚至在安南，也都受到法西斯威脅的。日軍的進佔海南島，距海防已不過一百幾十哩。在菲洲，意大利十萬大軍已集中於里比亞，大量的汽油和糧食正在貯藏着。四百五十架飛機和四千個飛行師已派到那面去。黑衫軍和飛機正集中於離法屬索謀里蘭甫境一百二十五哩的地方。據昨天海通電傳，意大利地中海艦隊之航空隊和航空母艦米拉格里亞號已開抵特里波利，這一切大槪都是對法國承認弗朗哥的答覆吧。從上面這許多事實看來，達拉第政策的破產是很明白的。一切分裂柏林，羅馬軸心的希望是像烟雲般消失了。德國的半官雜誌“Voelkische　Beobach-ter”說：「德國和意國必須携手並進，來對付東西兩方面。」</p>
<p>從慕尼黑到承認弗期哥，達拉第執行着對侵略者步步退讓的政策，法國的地位是一天天趨於危急了。達拉第爲什麼始終緊隨張伯倫，採取着這樣一味縱容侵略危害自身利益的政策呢？關於這，法國名記者塔布衣夫人最近曾有很透徹的回答：「事情沒有別的，達拉第所以維持退讓政策者，純粹是階級利益在作祟。法國有三個最顯著的階級：貴族，金融界及勞動羣衆。現爲前兩個階級當權，以爲戰爭不利於他們的階級利益，因此寗願拿民族利益來做階級利益的犧牲。」</p>
<p>然而法國今天已陷於萬分危急的地位，法西斯的拳頭也難免要打毀法國金融層的利益了。陶爾謨說；「時至今日，戰爭危機之大，已爲前此所未有，意國政府迭在北菲里比亞境內集中部隊之後，即彼瑞士聯邦，亦已採取各項必要的措置，以備必要時用以應付意國方面之威脅，此在法國，自未便再事因循。」是的，要保衛法國的安全，達拉第必須趕快及時醒悟，對侵略者採取堅决强硬的對策了，同時，我們更希望正在集議國家大事的法國社會黨，能夠認清目前危機，爲保衛祖國而竭力督促政府改變一味妥協的政策！</p>
<h3>英政府决定　再在金融上援助中國　為數約在三五百萬鎊之間　並聯美在經濟上抵制日本</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　每日電報外交訪員稱、西班牙戰局不久卽可結束、英政府乃在過去一星期中移轉其目光於早日了結中日戰爭、此觀於英國卽將以借款援助中國貨幣之消息而可知者、據聞此次借款在三百萬鎊至五百萬鎊之間、預計此款足以鞏固中國幣制、以抵制日本之破壞方法、中國在目前環境中、因愼重節用貨幣準備金之故、致其獲取軍用品之困難、大爲增加、英國在新借款成立之前、殆必通過特別法案、但政府必要的行動、卽可實施、此舉將於上星期輸出信用法最後通過後見之、中國亦受其惠、而可向英國購置大批載重汽車與其他用品、在過去數星期中、英美兩國政府、在嚴格經濟方面、對日施甩壓力之直接方法、亦曾加以考慮、並使日本遭遇極大妨碍、使其不能獲取大規模戰爭所必要之供給、此固英美荷三國權力所及者也、英國前所計議之數共二千萬鎊、但今已另籌使用他款之方法、簡言之、英國現擬會同其他友邦、强使侵略國共維和平、而用其偉大金融力量、以達此目的、限制日貨市塲、亦非難事、但此事須得英帝國各部份之同意、需時較久、始能實現、倫敦專家近已將此問題之各方面、予以檢討、以期以必要資料、供給政府、俾作政府决議之依據、按對華借款、去年七月曾經內閣考慮、但當時未予通過、蓋以此舉未有充量理由、且恐在歐洲危局進展之際、日本認此爲不友好的行爲也云、該訪員又稱、去年所擬之對華借款、其數爲二千萬鎊、今在美國去年十二月以二千五百萬元債款借與中國後、英政府準備在遠東採行積極計畫、於此可見英政府具有信任更大之精神、以應付現仍擾亂世界之戰爭問題矣云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透社外交訪員稱、英政府確在擬定細則、俾在財政上援助中國、惟各方面皆承認、種種必要佈置與談判、將費去若干時日、官塲在此環境中、不願發表進行消息、英政府所有行動、皆將與業已宣布維持在華利益之意旨相適合、至於外傳借款幾何、以援助中國幣制之消息、殆純出於猜測、惟可信談判現將完成、數日內當可宣布云、（六日路透雹）</p>

<h3>德國迫切要求　世界資源再分配　克服財政經濟困難　—宣傳部長戈培爾發表演說—</h3>
<p>萊潑齊城　本城市集已於本日開幕、宣傳部長、戈培爾曾出席發表演說、就德國經濟財政情况有所論述、渠雖承認德國經濟財政猶多缺憾、但力言此非德國之咎、其結論則謂、國際間各種措置、意在反對正常的買易者、均非德國所樂聞、「德國擁有人口八千萬人、若其經濟基礎過於狹隘、馴致無法生活無法工作、自决難認爲滿意、此層應請全世界各國認識之」、茲將戈培爾演詞全文、迻譯於次、</p>
<p>戈氏首謂、德國在一九三三年國社黨秉政以前、經濟局勢日趨衰頺、推原其故、實因當時當局所採原則之錯誤、蓋彼等以爲、一國雖無必要的威力但其經濟局勢仍不難整理就緒、此實鑄成大錯、」須知德國所保持之經濟基礎、無法以必要的食物供給全國人民、此種匱乏現象、并非吾人智力不足或活動不力所致、實因德國在全世界富源分配上、未能獲有其所應得之資源使然、」一言以蔽之、德國實爲資源不足之一國、不得不採取各種措置「加以補救、而當局此種措置，往往爲一般民衆所不能了解、且輒引起反感、同時各民治國尤其是英國、對於此種措置又復從旁加以訕笑、抑知各該民治國均擁有大量富源·大量原料品·大量殖民地、德國則否、但各該國在智力上暨在開發此項富源之方法上、固不必優於德國也、」至以德國而論、亦非毫無可以訾議之處、例如現行局勢、即係過去各當局之錯誤所致、先之以掀起戰事、繼之以簽訂凡爾賽和約、更復先後接受道威斯計劃與楊格計畫、如此一誤再誤、遂陷國族於深淵、直至國社黨出而秉政、始乃本諸最光榮的政洽熱誠、出之以最大的努力與最强的意識積極完成其使命、因此之故、國社黨政府對於現行局勢、不但不能負其責任、抑且獲致過去六年中之經濟成就、反可引以自豪、特吾人有不能已於言者、今世各民族中貧富不均、已屬無可諱言、而德國迄於今日，尙無一處殖民地、以取給原料品使德國現有之空間、不足以保障民族之生存、同時外國方面又時時設法切斷德國之市塲、要知德國要求生存、抑且有種生存、此則世人所必須了解者也、</p>
<p>德國在經濟上所遭遇之困難、雖如上述、但因舉國努力之故、其所製造之工業品已超過本國需要之上、自必以過剩之工業品、換取吾人所缺乏之全部或一部份原料品與製成品、惟其間有一主要原則、必須遵守、即吾人因限於財力之故、向外國購買貨物之數量、决不能高於本國貨物出口數量、德國在此原則之下、準備捐棄一切政治成見、以解决此項問題、或謂德國推行經濟自給主義、實則僅係一種傳說、質言之、德國惟在滿足民族需要範圍以內、於不得已時、始在經濟上採取自給自足辦法、即以政府所實施之四年經濟計劃而言、其目的亦僅在使德國經濟、不受外國原料品之束縛而已、德國曾發明各種原料「代用品、」其故即在於此云、</p>
<p>至是、德國戈培爾乃述及人工問題、略謂當前最急迫之問題、厥爲人工匱乏、現行經濟制度實有加緊使之合理化的必要、所可欣慰者、德國民族具有舉世無匹之毅力、目下在經濟上所遭遇之重大困難、純因地理的空間的缺憾所致、希特勒元首所手訂之方案、即爲克服此項困難之良好保障云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）社會黨對於外交政策、已分爲兩派、一派主張强硬、一派主張妥協、前當該黨於去歲十二月間舉行常年大會時、即有爭議、其結果爲强硬派佔優勢、茲者、該黨全國執行委員會、於前晚又在此間開會、兩派各有所發揮、旋即向全國執行委員會分別提出動議案、强硬派係以前財長沃利奧爾、前郵電部長勤罷爲代表、所提之案主張對於各全能國採取抵抗政策、至妥協派則以該黨秘書長孚爾、與前國民經濟部長史比那斯爲代表、主張仍與各全能國直接接觸、强硬派素得黨魁勃魯姆之贊許、此次勃魯姆因病未克躬自出席、該派地位自不免受有影響、但投票表决結果如何、此際尙難加以臆測、茲將沃利奧爾與勤罷二氏所提動議案、大要誌之於次、該案首先說明義國干涉西班牙國內戰之後法國業已受有威脅、並指謫龐萊外長所行政策、謂爲貽患非淺、日本帝國主義採取暴力行動之後、英法兩國在遠東方面之地位、亦已受有威脅、「法國社會主義者、深信法國不應長此消極、靜候新危機之米臨、必須立即在外交上發動積極的勇敢的政策、俾德義兩國咸能了解各該國若果佔據西班牙國、决非法國所能容忍」、此外、法國對於現行各項國際約束、尤其是英法協商與法蘇互助協定所規定之各種約束、必須信守不渝、美國總統羅斯福最近一再發表宣言、同情各民治國、尤當爲法國外交之南鍼云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於巴勒斯坦問題、英國政府代表與阿拉伯族代表團今晨舉行會議、猶太族代表團亦同時開會、此間頗有人以爲阿拉伯與猶太兩族之間、或可成立折衷方案、故巴勒斯坦問題會議、或得小有收獲、而不致完全失敗云（六日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>粵省糧食不敷供應　財部核准洋米進口　廣州市內米價飛漲　西江北江亦感缺乏</h3>
<p>香港通訊、粵省自廣州失陷後、除戰區各縣遭日軍蹂躪外、附近戰區各縣因兵燹影響、農人遷徙流離、大好稻田、多數荒棄、故自去年秋收後、內地米糧日少一日、有識者咸預料今春青黄不接之際、必鬧米荒、刧餘難民、不死於兵、將成餓殍、此誠一嚴重問題、蓋平時粵省米糧已不足自給、向仰賴暹邏安南榖米接濟、自廣州口岸被日軍封鎖、粵港航道梗塞已閱四月、當去年十月間、日軍入廣州之際、正値南海·番禺·東莞·各縣晚稻豊收、初因日軍未侵人鄕落時、各縣鄕人即乘時將已熟朱稻收割、然間有數縣、晚稻仍未達到豐熟時期、農人尙有持觀望熊度者、迨廣州近郊（如石牌鄉康東鄕等）有日騎開到、騾馬缺乏食料、日軍馬夫即任意將各鄕禾稻割下、以充騾馬食料、農人半年辛苦經營、一旦坐視他人用以飼畜、莫不憤恨刺骨、自日軍割稻飼馬消息一傳、其他各縣農人紛粉將未豐熟之禾稻、迅即收割、雖其中禾穗未結實者佔三四成、然亦不顧、藍與其歉收、尤愈於聽日軍之盜割也、</p>
<p>去冬兼收　去冬農人經此禾稻意外歉收、無論田主與佃戶均受莫大損失、間接卽影響全省糧食、平日產米之區（如南海·番禺·東莞·中山•從化等）在去年年底、因陳米尙未吿罄每元（粵幣毫券）約可　米六斤許至七斤、迨廣州日軍推廣侵略範圍、東至增城·從化之間、西至三水、北達番禺·花縣予取予携、南海屬之平洲鄕本爲產米最豐之地、當日軍初到、即首向該鄕搜括白米、動以數百包計、秋收之始、該地白米每元可購八斤至九斤、經日軍搜括之後、米價立漲、貧民無不切齒、</p>
<p>存米被奪　自廣州市區淪陷、全市米店已被搶刦一空、日軍利用奸細、查悉近郊昔村花地兩處有白米堆棧、遂用軍車將存米運載以去、華南米業公司存米數十萬担、華軍不及遷徙、當時亦盡被日軍掠奪、充作軍糈、同時因市面絕糧、日軍用懷柔政策將盜諸當地之存米、復轉售於市民、規定使用日軍軍用票方得交易、旣慷他人之慨、又可勒迫市民兌換軍用票行使、其計誠狡、然以苛虐之故、市民多不與交易、丟此市中小販不惜長途跋涉、由平洲等處運本地米回市零沽、然成本過昂、每元僅可售出四斤至五斤、似此米貴如珠、留市人民、生活自益形艱苦、</p>
<p>輸入洋米　粵省戰事延長、迄今已歷四月、各縣旣乏蓋藏、今春饑象遂見、而白米價格且較去年底昂貴一倍、戰區內貧苦人民無不面有菜色即非戰區各縣、亦因處青黄不接時期、無不大鬧米荒、粵軍政當局認爲事體嚴重、亟思設法早爲之所、特具呈中央財政部、由三月一日起、暫准一百萬担洋米免稅、此舉業經獲准、最近當局以西北兩江各地復感米糧缺乏、特再呈請財部、對予運粵洋米、暫准無限制免稅入口、否則最低限度准予五百萬担免稅洋米輸入、以救濟目前各地之荒歉、而濟民生焉、</p>
<h3>浙東抗戰中心　金華在躍進中（四）　敎育文化氣象蓬勃　建築倉庫存儲食糧　浙東旅行通訊</h3>
<p>金武永公路幹綫共長六二·三〇公里，永康至金華段佔三分之二，記者自永康汽車站乘車，乘客一供九人，據云：近日往來的旅客雖稀少，但客車仍能按時的行駛，這確爲交通事業所具的精神。蓋浙東的公路幹支綫以及縣道，年來在浙省府積極開築下，已完成預定的路綫計劃，且與江西各公路之重要據點相速接，當時工事大都征之於民，有力者自己應征，無力者雇工以代，今日江浙二省之公路，對軍事上實有極大的貢獻。因公路平坦，雖車行極速，車座並不覺顚動。在公路兩旁，全是高聳的山峯，汽車無異行在巨石之間。沿途村落頗多，每至小站，車略停數分鐘，車將抵金華站時，路旁有很多正在搭造中的泥屋，據同車人說：近來因人口增加，所以到處在建搭這類簡陋的泥草屋，以解决住的問題。</p>
<p>交通中心</p>
<p>金華今日不僅爲浙凍軍事活動的中心，且亦爲內地交通的樞鈕，　金華除浙贛鐵路之杭玉段以其爲中心外，尙有金武公路及金蘭公路，均以其爲起點，金武永公路自城南隔江的上橋起，南經嶺下的朱鎭入武義境而至永康，此路爲通浙沿海岸溫州的唯一要道，且形勢重要，現今至內地者，都經此路轉入。金蘭公路西達蘭谿縣，係自金武永公路的今古亭地方爲起點，而分支入蘭谿境，這條公路，因與浙贛鐵路的蘭谿支綫成平行綫，所以現在沒有按時的班車行駛。但一旦在必要時，其重要性並不小於金武永路。北山公路則爲便利游金華北山之旅客而由縣府建造的，現浙贛鐵路經過積極的籌備，浙江與桂林間的聯運已通車，而以金華站爲起點，故今日的金華，其在內地的交通上，巳處更重要的地位了。</p>
<p>物產富饒</p>
<p>金華縣的出產，以農產爲主體，特產亦以農業副產居首位，全縣年產一六三〇·〇〇〇担，普通農產方面，年可產小麥八〇·〇〇〇担，大麥七〇·〇〇〇担，雜糧三六〇〇〇〇担，其他尙有大豆糯米等，總共每年的普通農作特產額有一百八十餘萬組。故今日金華雖爲一人口　集之大城市，然在民食方面足供自紿。在金華的城區裏，到處滿顯得是繫榮的狀態，街上·旅舍·食館，都是擠滿了人。金華是浙東文化事業最發達的一地，初級教育方面，私立小學有一百八十餘所，縣立的有二十四所，中級教育計有省立金華中學，男女學生九百餘人，教員七十餘人。省立金華實騐農業學校，學生百餘人。金華縣立初級中學，有學生三百八十四人，私立的尙有作新初級中學，學生二百二十餘人，成美女子初級中學，學生六十餘人，在這個擁有着大量智識份子的金華，他們對於抗戰情緒的激烈，救亡工作的努力，也就可想而知了。在金華不僅是當地的學生們組織救亡團體，尙有許多來自滬杭一帶的救亡團體，歌詠隊，救亡戲劇團，他們都打成了一片，喚醒了整個金華以及鄰縣的民衆。</p>
<p>民情熱烈</p>
<p>金華城區有幾處傷兵醫院，設施頗佳，看護方面的工作，很多是由當地的青年婦女們担任，在金華城區的抗戰劇塲，時常有救亡宣傳的表演與演說，除了話劇外，最受人歡迎的是歌詠，在金華的民衆會唱幾支救亡歌，像「壯丁上前錢」，r保家鄕」之類，都自覺是很光榮的，金華不僅每個學校有一救亡歌詠隊或話劇團，其他如縣婦女會，縣市黨部等都有組織，全縣總共不下二三十個，所以今日金華全縣的救亡宜傳空氣特別盛，他們不僅在本縣內工作，同樣的也在浙東的各地宣傳着，無疑的，金華就是浙東一個活動的中心。城內的最繁盛段，自西市街至蓮花井一帶，也全是一片新氣象，全縣有壯丁六萬餘，凡屬壯丁年齡的，不分階級，都須編組受訓，成績極佳。每於淸晨傍晚，城郊外時有一組組的受訓壯丁，於教官領導下操練，記者所見，各隊受調壯丁均服裝整齊而動作敏捷。値得吾人提出的，爲地方倉庫的建造，金華縣府當局，因鑒於戰時貯糧的重要，及調整糧食的價格起見，最近除舊有倉庫外，另建成積穀倉一座及農倉二座，平時可容穀九千餘担，尙有新式倉庫一所，面積爲七·三畝，在短時期內亦可完成。</p>
<p>名勝之區</p>
<p>金華有北山，其脈自東陽縣的大盆山而來，蜿蜒起伏長凡四十餘公里，歷代名需僧道，很多在此隱居潛學。故金華山古蹟勝景星羅棋布，以前浙江省政府以此闢爲風景區，北山公路即爲是而建。記者慕其勝蹟，出金華的西大門取道北山公路步行而往，經十五里而至羅店，再繞道山徑行十里，抵雙龍洞及冰壺洞，因天時嚴寒，不能入洞，僅由雙龍茶店雇人在附近導游一周，冰壺絕景的水晶簾，也就沒有看到，殊覺可惜。</p>

<h3>敎部發表　高敎文化機關損失　全國高敎損失不堪回首　大學損失以圖書為最甚　私家藏書損失刦浩空前　古物損失二千九百餘箱</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）自七七事變、中國高等敎育及文化機關蒙受損害爲最大、敎部最近統計、截至二十七年十二月底止、各大學之設備圖書儀器、或焚或刦、或遭轟炸、損失大半、戰前大學及專科以上之學校、全國共一百八所、十八閱月以來、十四校受極大之破壞、十八校無法續辦、七十三校則遷移勉强上課、不能利用其原有之設備、以財產估計之、則國立學校損失達三千六百五十餘萬元、省立大學六百十餘萬元、私立大學二千二百六十餘萬元、國立學校中、如北京大學、爲中國創辦最早之大學、盡數損失、幾無法可以統計、其次如淸華大學、雖於圖書儀器稍有携出、然亦指失達六百零五萬元之鉅、私立則嶺南大學圖書儀器之損失、達三百八十餘萬元、南開大學達三百七十五萬元、此爲財產之尙可以數字估計者、至於其未可以金錢估其價値者、則有淸華大學、關於中國近代史檔案所搜集之材料、北京大學關於明淸兩代檔案、名家所藏金石拓片、及中國地實研究歷年所搜集之資料、南開大學關於華北經濟之研究資料、皆無法可以恢復、在學術上之損失尤爲重大、</p>
<p>在各大學之損失中、當以圖書爲最甚、以國立學校言、則損失一百十九萬一千四百叫十七冊、省立學校、十萬四千九百五十冊、私立學校、一百五十三萬三千九百八十冊、總計達二百八十三萬零三百八十六冊之多、但此僅就在淪陷區內之四十校計之、其數已如是之鉅、其在戰區內之學校、因遷移過遲不及運出者、損失亦大、例如國立山東大學之圖書儀器八百箱、中有藏書七萬六千七百二十四冊、均在浦口車站、全部損失、則各校損失之總數、可以見其龐大矣、</p>
<p>至於文化機關、損失亦重、淪陷區及戰區內之圖書、凡二千五百餘所、損失之最低限度、以平均每館五千冊計、全部損失至少、當在一千萬冊以上、但事實上沿海各重要都市之精美大圖書館、均陷入敵手、例如南京之國立中央圖書館、及江蘇省立圖書館、北平之國立北平圖書館、國立北京大學圖書館、及淸華大學圖書館、杭州之浙江省立圖書館、皆收藏豐富、且中多善本名抄、均遭毀損刦奪、尤可痛惜者、則爲私家藏書、此次亦幾盡數毀失、如吳與嘉業堂劉氏、常熟鐵琴銅劍樓瞿氏、蘇州滂喜齋潘氏、天津木犀軒李氏、藏本之精善、爲全國之冠、且有爲公家圖書館所不及者、盡數爲日人强掠以去、不但書籍也、即昔日刻書之木板板片、亦遭刦掠、國立中央圖書館損失七萬餘片，浙江省立圖書館損失十萬餘片、廣東湖北所有者、亦皆盡數損失、全國所藏木板、幾損失十分之七八、此後木刻善本、得之恐非易事、中國之建立新式公開圖書館、僅三十年間事耳、此次遽遭打擊、不僅精華盡失、目即普通書籍、亦幾損失殆盡、現在僅存之川桂陝甘四省圖書館、藏書達五萬冊者、不過五所、而滇黔諸邊區、則逾萬冊者、且不易覯、讀物來源問題、至爲嚴重、至於西文書籍、則以中國之財力、及購藏之晚、最大圖書館所藏、不過十萬冊、亦盡數毀失、携出者不過十分之一、是此次中國圖書損失之大、遭刦之重、在本國歷史上、固爲空前、即世界任何國家因戰事亦遭損失、亦無如中國所感受之重大、</p>
<p>至於古物之可資學術研究者、則北平故宮博物院、及內政部古物陳列所所收藏名貴古物、共計損失二千九百餘箱私人收藏、則蘇州潘氏所藏之周秦銅器、與怡園顧氏所藏名畫、即悉數與前述之吳與嘉業堂劉氏藏書、爲日軍刦去、其爲有計劃的摧殘、蓋可證明、最近日軍復將在上海之中華世界二大書局之儲存敎科岡書千餘萬冊、悉數刦去、以致已損失之書籍無法補充、可補充之書籍、亦無從購得、故日本之目的實在整個消滅中國之文化機構、使之無書籍可讀、無材料可資研究云云、</p>

<p>（理由）我國文字艱深、文盲衆多、過去用種種方法、推行識字敎育證明在最短期間、不易牧效、長此以往、文盲一日不消除、文化水準永無提高之布望、查拉丁化國語（亦有稱之爲新文字者）在國內推行有年、成效卓著、最近在上海難民收容所試騐、結果非常圓滿、平素不識字之難民學習一月即能閱讀、學習兩月即能書寫、收效之速遠勝直接敎授漢字、際此抗戰建國時期、掃除文盲以增强抗建之力量、實爲刻不容緩之舉、爰照急則治標之原則、應即設法試騐、推行拉丁化國語、以促文盲之廢除、</p>
<p>（辦法）一、拉丁化國語拚音、除敎授時得斟酌各地情形用本地方言作爲一種過渡辦法外、應一律用國語爲標準、藉謀國語普及並促進語文統一、二、根據全國語言實况、分爲國語區、廣東區、福建區、及江南區從事試騐、以便推行、三、凡通行國語及近乎國語之區域爲國語區、通行廣東語之區域爲廣東區、浙西及閩夏爲福建區、長江以南江浙一需爲江南區、四、國語區一律用國音爲標準、從事敎授、其他三區就同一程度並開兩班、一班開始敎授時、即用國語、另一班開始用士語敎授、作爲過渡辦法、達到相當程度時、再改用國語、藉此比較兩種敎法之效能、再定去取、五、由敎育部指定各區內若干敎育行政或學術研究機關、聘請心理、語言、及敎育專家組織委員會、負資進行試騐推動工作、</p>
<p>組織考試委員會甄別自修靑年案</p>
<p>（理由）抗戰以來、因戰區擴大及人民生命財產之損失、靑年多不能繼續求學、其有志上進者、祗得自行修習學科、以求補救、惟照現有敎育法令、靑年非在正式學校肄業或畢業者、不能取得敎育資格、以致有志靑年、因瓊境所限、旣不能進正式學校肄業、即便努力自修、也永無取得適當敎育資格之希望、顯然與民治主義之精神違背、爲鼓勵靑年求學及推廣敎育之效用起見、應設法使自修靑年之學業、獲得合法之承認、</p>
<p>（辦法）由敎育部斟的各省市縣情形特令該省市縣敎育行政機關組織自修生考試委員會確定各級學校考試科目及錄取標準負責辦理考取自修生、使其有升學或取得畢業資格之機會、大學及專科學校之錄取自修生、則由敎育部另行分區組織委員會辦理之、</p>
<p>推廣中學及大學敎育使淸寒子弟與業餘靑年得繼續求學案</p>
<p>（理由）我國中學及大學之入學手續限制極嚴、且費用頗多、以致淸寒子弟及業餘靑年欲繼續求學、不獨經濟力量所不及、且爲時間所不許、欲補救此缺陷、自應設法推廣、中學及大學敎育、使淸寒子弟與業餘靑年得一方面自謀生計、另一方面利用餘暇、繼續求學、</p>
<p>（辦法）一、高中專科學校及大學得附設夜班、假期班、或其他適當時間之班級招收選讀生、使淸寒子弟及業餘靑年、得視其經濟力量及可能時間、選讀一種或兩種以上之學程、完畢時、經考試及格後、由學校給予該學程之修業證明書、如能修畢某科或學系全部學程、經考試合格者、得照正式生同等待遇、給予畢業證書、二、專在夜間或其他業餘時間授課之中學、專科學校、及大學、如其設備訓育！及敎學成績經主管敎育行政機關調查、認爲滿意者、得享受正規學校之同等待遇、三、高中專科學校及大學得斟酌情形、在平常上課時間、收容選讀生、其辦法與第一條同、</p>
<p>高級中學取消年級升制而以學程爲單位計算學業進程案</p>
<p>（理由）現行學制完全以班級高下代表學業程度學生因某一學程考試不及格、即須留級重讀某年級全部課程、不獨耗費時間、且重讀已經讀過之功課、對於心理與學習效能、將發生不良之影響、</p>
<p>（辦法）高級中學（包括職業科與普通科）廢除年級升班制、而以學程爲單位、計算學業進度、凡對於某種學程考試不合格者、祗補修是項學程、修畢全部學程、考試及格者，給予畢業證明書、中途輟學或轉學者、以學程計算、給予修萊證明書、（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　北帮止進為出　現金反動猛跌　一度退達二一五五元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、驟然反動猛跌、實因英國又將貸款我國英金五萬鎊之說、且聞尙有其他新借款已在談判、因之外匯趨鬆、人心遂虛疲不振、賣戶蜂湧、北帮投機家出籠之心尤較其他殷切、價遂不支傾跌、唯中途曾因證劵帮暨某外銀行及本地帮等互相搜購、一度稍昂、卒以不久聞不利多方之消息後，證劵帮遂反進爲出、漲勢終難久持、結果猛跌廿八元、交易暢旺、銀樓飾金亦隨之回小三元、海關金曁中英純金等復趨呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤下瀉念八元</p>
<p>自晨每條十兩、初開賣價爲二千一百九十元光景、進者均審愼旁觀、未幾證券帮忽來拋塞、故市勢頓疲、直喊低至八十元內始見做開、時已十點一刻、首由證券帮售予錢兌業十兩、二千一百七十五兀爲開盤價、較上週六做低十五元、開後金號亦來吐售、故續向下挫、金號售予錢兌業五十兩、價七十二元、繼之相同價證券帮亦賣予錢兌業五十兩、此後證劵帮忽反出爲進、且本地帮與某外銀行亦跟蹤搜購、致價亦卽反動上騰、證券帮進錢兌業一百五十兩、一躍而爲八十二元、後某銀樓代本地帮亦進另一錢兌業百兩、爲八十元、相同價某錢兌業又代外銀行吸進同業五十兩、未幾某銀樓回吐予證券帮五十兩、價八十五元、時已十一點半、其時突聞英國又貸款中國英金五百萬鎊之說、而外匯亦逐漸回硬、人心重向下疲、證券帮亦止進旁觀、賣方喊低至八十二三元、然仍難獲對手、直至午時未見做開、故午收價仍作八十五元、午後雖某錢兌業獲利復進三百餘兩但以北帮亦力託另一錢兌業及證劵帮傾向吐售、且外匯亦逐步報鬆、故價復向下游、首由錢兌業互做五十兩、價七十五元繼之又互做百兩、價七十六元後某錢兌業與證券帮力塞二百餘兩、價遂做低至五十五元、均由金號及錢兌業納進、此後因北帮止出、故遂復向上升、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價二千一百六十二元爲晚收價、聞收後照晚收價仍有人來賣出、但未見做開、結果較上週六軋跌廿八元、（全天州元差度）、現金號之本牌金、售出價二千一百七十元、收進二千一百五十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小三元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時因烚赤開低十餘元故亦掛小一元、後又至下午二時三刻、因烚赤竟又猛跌、故亦再掛小二元、大同行老慶雲等改縣二百十九元、新同行二百十七元、收進二百十一元、</p>
<p>關純金一致未更</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價仍爲一千二百十元〇九角、掛脾海關金亦仍屬二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦未更動、仍爲一千二百〇六元二角、乃四日倫教電英純金復趨平定、每盎司仍爲七鎊八先令四辦士所致云、</p>
<h3>英又將對華貸款　滙市緊後驟形鬆動　港匯則未分榮辱</h3>
<p>滙市昨初開、潛勢幣軟、計英金一度退爲八便士〇九三七五、美匯亦曾軟至十五元八一二五、（洋行結進價）、嗣後驟然反動轉鬆、初時之緊、因各大洋行與華商紗花帮爭先扒吸、且其時外商銀行賣意頗淡之故、嗣後因聞英國經擠援華、又將有五百萬鎊貸華之說、故外商銀行賈意遂濃、加以外電香港亦突來猛塞、致見步鬆、結果英美兩滙、均見鬆動、交易頗旺、至港匯雖洋行與錢兌業互相購結、但以外銀行供意亦殷、致爲狀依然平穩、</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條、近期仍平、遠期續長〇六二五、紐約銀價如舊、倫敦生金亦無升降、滙兌英對美小三毫、對法·對滬、均未更動、美對英降〇六二五、對法未更、對滬跌二分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行晨開賣價、英滙八便土一二五、美匯十五元八四三二七五、較上週末英美兩滙均平、開後外銀行賣意頗淡、且洋行結款較殷、致市勢帶軟、洋行結進麥加利英金八便士〇九三七五、滙豐掛牌及白銀平衡稅揭曉、均無變更、此後華商紗花帮亦購華比美滙十五元八一二五、其時突聞英國又將有英金五百萬鎊貸華之說、故外銀行賣意轉濃、故潛勢亦漸回平、匯豐麥加利售予洋行英金八便士一二五、繼之荷蘭某行賣予洋行美滙十五元八七五、近午外行安達亦售予洋行港匯五十四元三七五、爲狀平穩、午收銀行賣價英金八便士一二五、美匯十五元八七五、</p>
<p>後市港電力賣予有利華比某行英金八辨士一四〇六二五、兼美匯十五元九〇六二五、故潛勢帶硬、此後洋行吸進滙豐英金八便士一二五、繼之叉結進某行美滙十五元八七五、最後外行荷蘭賣予錢兌業港滙五十四元三七五、致爲狀稍平、晚收銀行賣價英匯八便士一四〇六二五、美滙十五元九〇六二五、結果較上週六英長〇一五六二五、美鬆〇六二五、港則仍無榮辱、</p>
<h3>貼現出五十元關　比上週六狂抬九元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、因現鈔需途日廣、求者急切、交換所致又起提高至（每千元）五十元、故市上之貼率亦隨之飛昂、出五十元關外、自晨初爲五十元强、繼更步高至五十二元、午刻五十一元、下午未見更動、仍爲五十一元，較上週六再猛漲九元云、</p>
<h3>外幣賣出者多　英金鎊猛降五角</h3>
<p>上週六日英純金未動、英美匯兌降零六二五、昨外匯洋行結款甚旺、銀行供給未爽、趨勢軟弱、後港電拋塞稍盛、市價漸平，結果微軟烚赤開盤卽呈頹勢，因運日飛漲過多、散戶危險殊甚、出籠心思濃厚、價至下降、天津帮初則假意維持、略爲吸納、以拉上市價、後則竭力拋塞、獲利利利了結、致市價升降倐忽、變動甚鉅、全日交易紛亂、趨勢軟弱、外幣隨金價動盪、殷富多獲利拋塞、英美金鎊激烈下降、英美金票等未丟匯票軟弱趨漲、反因金價下跌而軋小、全日交易賣出者多、多數下降、趨勢軟弱、公會交易平庸、香港票成交特鉅、惠通出勤泰進香港票一千元、泰和興出勤泰進香港票五千元、利通出勤泰進香港票九百元、惠通出恒茂進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊降五角、英金票降五分、美金鎊降三角、美金票降一分五厘、香港票降三厘、法郎票降五毫、新加坡票坎拿大票各降一分、斐律濱票降二分、澳金票降四角、共他各幣、但未更動、</p>
<h3>糧食　米上大漲　都為搬動出洋　米商乘機居奇</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源更稀、河下到頭四五、車運來包于亦二千餘包、蓋自某方在常錫等地大舉搜辦出口、更又壟斷提高糙米之價至十一元一二角、致滬埠來源寥落、來貨身本遂高、白粳已在十五元左右、滬客在此環境之下、欲求顧全身本、遂都堅持高價、不肯輕脫、乃經囤戶及本街一動、市面立星奔騰、形勢混沌、所以結果若厚薄粳行情上升大有參差、自二角至三四角不等、杜洋尖埠尖際此亦均並提三四角、變元亦漲上三角有奇也、市上雖限價十四元、原係一種手段、暗將次米抬高、實際上所限者何在、此種局面之來臨、尙在發軔之始、來日艱難、好爲在當局必能出而救濟也、至於內地米糧、並不在少、若無搬運出洋、民食决不如此恐慌也、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　續降五分　洋粉到滬不無影響　小麥市面依然停頓</h3>
<p>粉市昨日已步吿鬆落、查客帮交易、自上週未成交一批後、昨市續有問津、惟近日洋粉到滬聲中、售價迭經疲落、本粉前途、不無影響、更兼澳麥已新到七千三百五十三噸、各廠原料頻增、對於客盤、不得不格予優待、聞廠盤已續低五分之說、僅開四元六角半、同時本街批價亦由四元七角半降至七角、統市由南北兩帮辦去二號粉車船各牌及雜牌粉併計達五六萬包、聞客帮售出之粉、均未現交、大槪陸續提貨云</p>
<p>麥市近因供求兩方都吿缺乏，無形中已停頓多日矣、昨爲週初之期、而　胃依然觀望不前、其原因實由於洋粉麥傾銷影響、貨方以成本關係、動輒扳持、而廠方則反擬抑小而取、故雙方擯持結果、又無隻包成交、</p>
<h3>蕪湖米有被統制說　轉口消胃甚勁　洋米喊十六元</h3>
<p>昨客秈客化甚貪、京蕪各秈統市開出五千餘包、除客囤與日商外、本街進胃亦見加旺、且以產價高昂、向在產地直接辦銷者、亦在滬市吸收、市上又有謠傳蕪湖當地已被日方統制、僅許日商某洋行一家運銷、故人心更爲激昂、行情猛漲三四角、即常見沉寂之西貢洋米、昨日復有十六元之喊價云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債恢復後市　華電股上漲已不少</h3>
<p>證券暗槃、昨日市况午前猶在醞釀帶堅、因元大已無貨賣出、午後忽起鉅大反動、漲風漸勁，市上又盛傳新借款成功、其實此種傳說已久、檯面之驟漲、完全因大戶售貨已止、而買戶興趣正濃、此久爲本報所預料、此後情形、因丙種已衝出八元、戊種已衝出七元、縱有回風、終究尙須看漲、午前初開、爲承康號首先吸收、得風氣之先、同康號跟踪做多、十號及散戶多頭了結、終略堅漲二三角、午後已恢復市面、開做後、天生號吸收較湧、同康多頭再行加碼、散戶亦有買進、錢業帮亦進多出少、一致上騰、多者驟漲七角半、前途祗須大戶不再壓迫、尙可繼續上漲也、市價結果一致上漲、好六角至一元不等、成交總數約計一百二十餘萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股一百股、價五元三角五分、</p>
<h3>紗花　節令將轉　同業爭購細紗　市盤獨漲一二元</h3>
<p>紗市依然平順、趨勢稍帶軟狀、蓋以實需不及上日之旺盛、惟雲南帮十支粗紗交易尙堪維持、天津帮納胃稍滯、其他帮口亦無動辦消息、人心因此平疲、至於同業心思觀漲占多數、大衆皆有捏貨、故近日互做交易不多、但有一部份仍以黃金昂騰、略有收進、然市態未能激起、三二支·四二支細紗同行爭購尤烈、氣候轉達夏季、此項細紗需用增進、且加之市上存貨單簿、市態獨挺、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、實際交易仍無起色之象、各帮皆無電報委託、因之人氣鬆懈、開盤價二十支雙馬紗仍做三百九十九元、與上日無甚軒輊、少頃雲南帮對於粗細紗又來採辦、然額量未旺、市價稍昂、漲勞甚微、惟十支粗紗尙帶緊象、迨至收盤時、聞黄金仍昂、雙馬復到四百元、午後市塲更形冷靜、到會人頭極稀、客帮交易仍屬不旺、雙馬回小五角、做三百九十九元半、結果全日各帮成交統計一千〇四十二包、仍以同業成交占一半有餘、行情平均二十支紗與上日相仿、惟十支粗紗及三二支細紗則堅昂一·二元不等、廠方未有舉動、茲將各帮口買去成交之額量、分列於左、</p>
<p>日紗市面尤覺呆滯、因匯劃貼率飛漲、以致無形中漲高矣、故客帮銷路愈弱、二十支水月現紗價爲三百三十五元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百三十元至二十九元云、</p>
<h3>海外棉市頻漲不已　棉行交易停頓</h3>
<p>外棉市價、蘭開夏方面布疋暢銷、需棉甚殷、而美政府貸款棉之放出無期、市上棉額不多、而蘭開夏到處搜購、因之紐約棉市步漲、迭見新高峯、昨日三月份又出八、七一之新價綜合多方報吿、棉市讀有上漲可能、昨日紐約漲五六磅音、印度又因甘地絕食停市、據本埠某大棉行接到電吿、預測四五月份白洛區棉價爲一五四羅比七半、埃及漲三四磅音、昨日匯兌較鬆、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西棉每担漲四角、印棉漲二角、埃及棉漲三角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因海外棉市連漲、折合法幣、較數日前每担猛漲四五元、故交易較淸、唯各本棉印號、因本棉來路稀少、時有中斷可能、一部份花號巳販買外棉、前進之貨、每担盈餘已可五六元、各花號均振乘此高價脫手，故各本棉掮客連日奔走兜銷甚力、昨日合豐廠進美種彭加浦一百包、合送廠價七十八元、顧乾記花號進印棉白洛區五百包、棧交七十一元、又上海紗廠進印棉五百包、出大進五百包茲將昨日棉價合成送廠價、分列於後、</p>
<h3>火機花　漲達七十元　還是現鈔行情</h3>
<p>本棉生意雖形沉寂、然售價繼長增高、蓋以各路來源受種種牽制、恐有斷絕之虞、故市價　漲達不能再漲之境、然存貨旣薄弱、而到貨又無希望、所以市價難以鬆懈、火機花新高峯層出不窮、現貨價已至七十元矣、蘇北來源仍稀、僅下沙細絨花一百五十包、廠家隻包未有成交也、寗波來姚花一萬四千包、今日有機棉花五百件運青島、茲將現棉做開市盤並額量列左、</p>
<p>一二〇件　滙劃棧交</p>
<p>二〇〇包　現鈔棧交</p>
<p>二〇〇包　現鈔棧交</p>
<p>一六〇包　現鈔棧交</p>
<h3>油餅　油市越出常軌　生油有直上靑雲勢　大連光餅再昻一角</h3>
<p>油市之人心、愈見激昂賣買態度之混亂實所罕見、各種生豆油行情之論價、均越出常軌、昨豆油冉騰一元、花生油冉暴漲一元七角、勢尙未殺、大有直上青雲之概、計做開膠州生油八百件、泰倉生油一百件、青島聽裝生油七百餘聽、爲本街及香港帮所辦、現豆油成交七百餘件、訂期交貨須在一千八百桶之上、豆餅買銷祇有福州帮辦去常州協豐廠四脾元隆餅一千片、價爲三元四角五分、行情比前市無甚軒輊、惟大連光邊餅爲投機家操縱、再跳一角、訂妥四月份交五千片、價爲三元四角半、</p>
<h3>藥材　新山柰不日可到</h3>
<p>山柰新貨、聞某號已向汕頭辦成數十件、約星期四可抵滬、查此間舊存陳貨將罄、故首批新貨、雖身份略遜、而色澤則較白凈、且本年出數不多、地價高昂、刻預測未來號盤、殆與最近市價（陳貨售二十五元）可以並駕齊驅云）、</p>
<h3>疋頭　遠路定購各貨　趕裝頗亟</h3>
<p>國布白貨轉堅、常令漂白淺色布細紗綫織品、銷路良好、價亦穩健、深色布疋去路呆滯、價獨不振、白貨怡和粗布、因廠盤提高、昨市九磅·十一磅每疋各漲一角、十三磅·十四磅·十六磅每疋各漲二角、內衣廠九磅漲五分、惟客帮進意殊淡、細布·細斜以廠盤堅定、現銷稍增、手貨每疋扳高五分之譜、甬帮辦砲車·大鵬各牌細布、細斜五十包、粵帮辦富貴·申大·三花·愛字各牌細斜近二百包、春夏貨洋紗·府綢·白地色丁·漂布等淺色布疋、溫甬閩近路各帮採辦漸殷、而川·滇·天津還路購定之貨、趕裝頗亟、各廠積極交貨工作殊忙、售盤多數趨昂、深色布疋類多存擱、售盤照目下紗綫坯布原料計算、僅敷成本、</p>
<p>東布細布細斜、昨日本街染銷仍無起色、津帮對於現貨稍稍添辦、而期貨頗有韓出、高檔細布、浮戶手貨更多、市勢一疲、亟求出售、故龍頭·彩球·飛魚等牌細布、跌風最厲、每疋猛降二角之譜、中檔五福、雙魚比較平穩、每疋跌一角、今日成交約八百餘件、龍頭·細布市塲最低盤做過十一元九角後復回升至十一元九角半、同業大戶心思、依然看高、</p>
<p>今日有疋頭二千六百八十件運天津、</p>
<h3>呢羢春銷發動</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢毛貨市銷激增、因元脊節已過、春令實銷發動、本街呢羢洋貨綢緞門莊帮、交易日見遞增、西服裁縫帮、衣着營業亦續繁、中西裝衣料走路活絡、公茶會上與大批發戶及現貨洋行等、逐日大有開出、按邇日各帮買方、鑒於滬地商業繁榮、均放健胃口吒進、拆貨帮亦復放賬俾可推廣營業、若安凱第本特洋行、義昌泰呢號等一般跑街、近來皆忙於奔走兜售分料、其八九元一碼之意大利貨、似四萬二千號之質地等、銷路最暢、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆實銷平常</h3>
<p>黄豆銷塲、在此飛黄騰達之鋒鋩下、反呈零落、總之受各方環境牽制、人心異動、投機心思濃厚、致市價猛升未已、昨四月份大連豆成交三十餘軍、價爲八元四角及四角二分、比上週六市横加二角、現豆祇成交一車、價爲八元四角半、其他浦東杜豆價已達十元、妥交一百包、崇明沙黄妥開四百包、價爲八元二角五分至三角半、尙有初次上市之嘉定豆成交百許包、價爲七元七角及七元九角半云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　同安圓肉　價漲三元半</h3>
<p>同安生晒肉、大結束前所到五十餘箱、因成本加昂、故堅持未開、據客電須漲四元、但行方還價未能近　、致紅盤亦無成交、茲聞雙方談價　洽、照前盤加漲三元半、如數開通云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　美法絲銷　相形見絀　意人造絲又到五千餘箱</h3>
<p>昨日紐約星期無市、横濱人心依然堅挺、一二月份一〇五五元、漲二四元、四月份一〇五〇元、漲二九元、五月份一〇三二元、漲二一元、六月份一〇〇九元、漲六元、七月份一〇一三元、漲十元、最遠期八月份一〇一八元、漲十二元、現貨一〇五五元、漲二〇元、雖收盤各期貨均略回小、現觀乎晨市人心、絲市前途似尙堅穩有餘、</p>
<p>本埠情形、白廠經B字市價重開一九二〇元、交易雖屬零星、但終因國內存底寥寥可數、絲價依然灼熱異常、昨B字金猴等級做開一九二〇元、推測市氣、一時不致鬆懈、印莊絲市、昨亦起囤貨情形、三星等白頭行昨進千金絲反車絲八五担、市價隨漲一二十元、回顧英法絲銷、反相形見拙、蓋邇來滬地與美法絲價、相距甚遠也、</p>
<p>意國人造絲大量運來、計上月二十一日意輪康脫皮愛卡曼諾運來四千八百箱、已誌前報、前日（即五日）又有意輪康脫羅索號抵滬運來人造絲、較前更多、計五千三百箱、爲抗戰以來人造絲進口之新紀錄、</p>
<h3>糖市　二十七年　潮糖運銷總數</h3>
<p>據汕頭通訊、二十七年份潮糖出口總數共爲八＋萬六千餘包、其中因交通困難關係、除上海·天津·烟台·青島·寗波·等處照常直運外、漢口則由香港轉運、餘如鎮江·蕪湖·安戾·南京·濟南等處、並無運往、惟總數較二十六年爲多、茲分別誌之如後、</p>

<h3>四郊風聲鶴唳　吳淞日軍被襲　樊士林部格斃日軍隊長　浦東華軍决心待機大舉</h3>
<p>游擊隊樊士林部、昨晚（五日）在細雨濛濛中、向吳淞迂　推進，與日軍發生遭遇戰、樊部冒雨衝殺、銳不可當、格斃日軍隊長山田一名、士兵二十餘名、奪獲輕機槍一挺、自動步槍十餘支、樊部僅傷隊士三名、旋日軍大隊聞訊趕到、樊已率部遠去、</p>
<p>華軍配配相當實力</p>
<p>浦東上南邊界一帶、自日軍利用偽「軍」首領徐鴻發、將秦興炎部下劣質隊伍劉新如·杜天鵬·劉德忠·張林根·等一百餘人、編爲僞「軍」後、卽分別駐紮於北蔡鎭一帶、若輩甘心做日軍屛障、隔斷南碼頭白蓮涇一帶、日陸軍與游擊險正面之遭遇戰、且彼等與徐鴻發合流後、無人管束、野心爆發、無惡不作、而鐵路以北陸續收編士匪、又已增至二百餘人、游擊隊一再致意從速反正、以資贖罪、乃野心難馴、迄未醒悟、於是華軍各部、配備相當實力、决心待機、從事痛勦、以弭隱患、故日來上南鐵路沿綫、及白蓮涇南碼頭北蔡一帶、情勢吃緊、風聲鶴唳、一若戰事卽將爆發、較爲殷實之鄕民、均被迫遷走、日僞軍雙方更惶惶不可終日、對於該處一帶水陸交通、出入平民、搜查綦嚴、且任何人如身畔未帶僞「市民證」者、就加以槍殺、白蓮涇港口、竟連續慘殺平民三人、</p>
<p>日偽企圖固守滬西</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據本埠靈通方面消息、日僞當局、對上海四週華方游擊隊之日趨活躍、深致關切、决派「維持政府公安部」之「綏靖軍」特別部隊五百名、前來毘連租界之區域中、志在遏制反日份子、聞日軍因鑒於駐守後方游擊區內之兵方不足、乃取此舉、據華方消息稱、此特別部隊之五百人、均爲土匪與紀律蕩然而武裝窳劣者所組成、聞所謂「綏靖軍」之一部份、業已到達滬西日軍控制區內之指定地點、同時、上海郊外之游擊隊、活躍繼續不斷、揚子江下游之鐵道與公路、遭游擊隊破壞者頗多、此等陸上運輸錢，均不能維持定期交通、浦東南部之亭林·葉榭·川沙·已每日發生流動戰、上海西區、每隔一定時期、輒聞槍聲、日軍刻正在上海以內與四週、取嚴緊之戒備、黃浦江各渡口登陸旅客、亦遭嚴厲檢查、喧傳已久之蘇北日軍、對游隊作肅淸戰、開已趨停頓、因流動部隊作戰純熟、日軍巳遭敗北、</p>

<p>販商停辦囤戶居奇</p>
<p>上海荳米業市塲、因受日偽直接向產區採辦影響、昨日市塲頭號白米、已漲至十四元限價、販商因產地米價飛漲、運滬之米、成本高於滬市、故相率停販、以致每日到貨稀少、僅二三千包左右、一般囤戶、不允出售、市塲價格、有超過十四元之限價趨勢、雖經市塲管理委員竭力勸告、但暗盤交易、竟逾越十四元、各米店之零沽、每石已漲至十四元五角、</p>
<p>分別勸吿維持民食</p>
<p>荳米業公會昨日議决維持十四元原來限價後、即由委員陳子彝·符前耕·等分別向常熟帮等販商勸吿應顧全大局、維持上海民食、並定今日派員向公共租界工部局·法租界公董局·呈報米市情况、要求速妥籌善策、以免滬市民食發生恐慌、聞租界當局所組之米糧管理委員會、對租界內之民食、甚爲重視、幸租界內存米總數六七十萬包、足供三個月之需、故認上海租界內之民食、暫時不致缺乏恐慌、</p>
<p>華北商人訂購洋米</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向米　界探悉、日偽向產地採辦之米、以運至華北為大宗、最近盛傳日偽又欲統制產地米糧、對採辦米糧者、必須有採辦證、如果外傳成爲事實、則米糧之運滬、勢必更受影響、又華北商人委託外商、向貢訂購洋米、總額已逾五十萬包、均裝輪直接運至華北交貨、以致洋米價格亦為之提高、每包成本、須十七八元、故滬市洋米價格、隨之高漲、</p>

<p>規定航輪停靠港口</p>
<p>日方軍事當局、近已接受日淸公司請求、實施統制長江下游航運、决定先從江北綫着手、於三月十日起、除（海門）靑龍港、（南通）天生港、（如皋）新生港·張黃港、（靖江）新港、（泰興）天星橋·徐岸、（揚州）霍家橋等八港口、爲規定航輪停靠、准許開放外、其餘各港口、藉口軍事關係、一律封鎖、以上八港口、均由日淸公司加派輪船行駛、並由日海軍方面組織巡江隊、隨時派艦保護貨運、</p>
<p>日淸壟斷增輪行駛</p>
<p>日淸輪船公司、除將長江封鎖綫上游之航運、全部獨佔、拒絕外商營業外、復積極競爭長江下游各港口之航運、俾使沿江商運、悉數攫取壟斷、該公司於二月二十五日起、曾將行駛上海·蕪湖·漢口·間之商輪中、抽調五艘、改開下游通（州）如（皋）靖（江）各口岸外、復添造新型商輪四艘、其噸位由二千噸起至三千五百噸、支配在各港口行駛、並在上海及內地、設立轉運公司、專門替日輪接洽貨運、至貨運水脚、仍與各輪相同、將來外輪營業打倒後、勢必另訂新率、提高運費無疑、</p>

<p>戰事開始　無人料想其規模將發展至目下之巨大、故决以朝鮮銀行紙幣充軍費、但戰區之擴大、出乎意料、致不能賡續利用此等紙幣、否則將使日本銀行紙幣受非所願有之重負如現所將述者、此種局勢、乃導成在華北設立發行紙幣之新銀行、初擬以河北省立銀行爲核心、而組織一新銀行、但立即承認此種彌補計劃、均不適當、其初一步驟、務須調整以前華北各銀行、如河北省立銀行與冀東銀行等所發行之紙幣、俾置貨幣制度於鞏固而統一之基礎上、於是所提議的</p>
<p>發行紙幣　之銀行、乃告成立、名曰「華北聯合準備銀行」、經核准資本日金五千萬元、資本之半、全數付出、內一千二百五十萬元由「臨時政府」付出、華北之華方銀行、如河北省立銀行·冀東銀行·鹽業銀行·金城銀行·中國銀行·交通銀行等八家合出一千二百五士萬元、日本各銀行亦貸予信用借款日金一萬萬元、該新銀行之富源、大爲增强、但中國與交通所持有作爲新銀行準備金之白銀、存於英法兩租界者、該兩行拒絕交出之故、乃發生困難、是項白銀、佔「聯準銀行」之五千八百萬元銀準備之大部份、（未完）</p>

<p>滬定復航尙待核示</p>
<p>滬定航綫、自經寗波軍事當局命令滬台綫各輪、不准兼灣後、該綫交通、即吿中斷、會迭由各方請求恢復、迄未邀准、旋定海魚商方面、以滬輪斷絕、致所有魚鮮、無法運滬銷售、攸關漁民生計至鉅、故經瀝陳理由、申請寗波防守司令核示、郭司令亦以救濟魚業、事實切要、於日前曾召集定海漁商、及有關機關代表、到部會商、經擬定魚運辦法四項、轉電第×集團軍總司令部審定、茲悉總部據呈後、聞已將原辦法電呈上級軍事當局核示、俟奉復後、再行飭遵、</p>

<h3>我政府與滙豐銀行　穩定滬黑市塲外匯　經考慮後中國有特殊情　如治外法權等取締非易事</h3>
<p>自我國政府統制外滙後、對必需品之輸入、由中央銀行供給法定外滙、對主要土貨之輸出、依法向中國交通兩銀行結售外滙、關於奢侈消耗品之輸入、則不予供給法定外滙、於是凡經營奢侈品消耗品之商人、因自己無法請領購買外匯、乃轉向外商銀行購買、外滙之黑市塲、隨之發生、上海市黑市塲外滙、財政部曾經一再考慮、認爲黑市塲外滙、並非中國獨有、世界各國都有、不過中國之黑市塲、有其特殊情形、比較難以取締、其原因（一）中國有租界、（二）有治外法權、（三）有華僑滙款、因華僑匯款、都是零星小數、我國在海外未普設銀行、所以有許多滙款、向來操在外商銀行之手、因此外滙不容易統制、其次有租界、有治外法權、許多地方政府權力不能達到、因此無法取締、更非政府一紙命令可以辦到、今爲穩定黑市塲之外匯起見、已與英商匯豐銀行互相合作、所以上海之黑市塲外滙、此後不致發生重大上落、關於供給法定外滙、仍由中央銀行依照政府頒佈之辦法辦理、</p>
<h3>恐怖份子　赴平活動　王克敏險遭伏法</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、傳聞大批恐怖份子頃已由津抵平、上星期五日晚曾圖入「臨時政府」辦事處、彼等均穿便衣、曾與僞政府守門偽軍開槍互舉、旋即離去、彼等且圖暗殺偽「臨時政府」行政院長王克敏與其他僞政權高級人員、日軍所出版之日報「武德報」（譯音）之編輯其華人、亦遇兩便衣者光臨、日軍今取特殊戒備、以阻止便衣華人活動、</p>
<h3>日軍在滬東區　昨拘捕五華人　榆林路捕房當派員交涉　雙方引起誤會旋即解决</h3>
<p>公共租界東區楡林路捕房轄境鹽山路上、於昨日下午一時許、曾發生日海軍特務隊拘捕五華人事、事後調查、據稱當該五華人被捕時、乃日軍直接行動、故捕房方面直待各人家屬報告後、方始得悉、並因此種行動、不符合作原則、乃卽前往交涉、並追詢拘捕緣由、依據日方所稱、則指認彼等爲反日恐怖份子、因加逮捕、但結果竟無佐證提出、於是捕房方面由該區區長指派西督察長勞勃生前往虹口專訪日軍當局、依據合作原則、要求將該五華人釋出、或交捕房偵查、如或仍無證件提出、則應立卽恢復若輩自由、以符原約、但斯項交涉、未獲日軍當局同意、甚且彼此發生誤會、竟與勞勃生爲難、幸斯際警務總巡裘禮德君與該區長已得到報告、乃亟邀約日軍當局同在楡林路捕房臨時交換意見、一塲誤會、始獲解决、時已下午六時許、該五華人因日方堅稱尙待偵查、故仍被扣在日司令部、刻下正在續商中、惟當時因日軍官前往捕房集議時、曾隨有大批陸戰隊士兵、在楡林路捕房四週佈崗警戒、外間不察、流傳不一、以致形勢似極嚴重、</p>
<h3>外商　航業進展　各公司添輪加班　意又有鉅輪將到</h3>
<p>中日戰事發生後、中國航業、恐遭日海軍攔阻、沿海綫自動全部停頓、因而洋商船隻、遂從中漁利、但內地交通、亦賴以貫通、故在過去時期中、懸掛洋商旗之航商、獲利頗豐、即報關業、亦盈餘不少、至於歐美航綫之各郵船、在滬郊有戰事時、雖貨運</p>
<p>蒙受影響　而一般富裕者、均往海外逃避、以致搭客利市十倍、且以赴香港尤衆、有時竟客票難購、票價因之激增、故以客票以抵貨運、對於營業上亦毫無損失、至近一年以來、中國對外貿易、已恢復舊觀、如絲茶桐油以及皮革毛類等輸出、較戰前</p>
<p>尤為起色　惟外貨（除日貨外）輸入略遜、但本年迄今、三閱月之中、印棉進口甚鉅、聞均爲日商所採購、航業在中日戰期中、如此發達、事出意料、航商均抱樂觀、乃有添輪加班之舉、大英公司新建廣東號、儎重一萬七千餘噸、巳於上年十一月來滬、加入航行、昨日該輪已第三次抵滬、定明日開往日本、又悉、外難二十六號意國郵船公司郵船康鐵羅索·康鐵凡特·康鐵皮愛卡曼諾·維多亞號·四郵船</p>
<p>速率甚快　上海至Genoa祗須二十三天即可到達、近聞該公司叉有新輪哥里奧西薩爾GuiLio　Csarl號來滬、該輪原係行駛意國至北菲洲之間、排水量爲二萬七千五百噸、內部爲最新式之設備、因向駛熱帶、故客位祗有頭二等、並無三等　位、爲來滬　　中之　、該輪現已　　、預定於本年五月十六日來滬試航、</p>
<h3>意輪又載來　猶太難民　計四百五十人</h3>
<p>字林報云、德奧猶太難民四百五十人、搭意郵輪康鐵羅素號昨日（五日）午後低、目下上海猶太難民總數、因此巳逾四千人之多、此間照顧新來難民之委員大批人員、待於海關碼頭、照料彼等經過例行之海關手續、一如前例、而大批卡車、則駛抵入口處、俾載送行李、聞昨日到來者、將在河濱大厦棲身、蓋該厦之一部份乃歸難民委員會所使用也、至於若干單身男子、則將安插於華德路新寓所、該寓所已於若干時日前開放、能容一千二百人、豫料此後數月內復有若干難民來滬、估計其數達六千人之多、據各方面消息、彼等已預定來遠東之船票、大都　來上海、</p>

<h3>由人造雌雄法說到　男子身體的必要保養</h3>
<p>近代的科學真是突飛猛進，幾乎任何困難的問題，都可由科學來解決。關於自然科學方面偉大的成就，我們果然罄竹難書，就拿生理學方面的人體生殖腺一項的研究，也就足夠驚人了！斯丹那氏竭其畢生經騐，對於人體生殖腺作艱辛實騐，結果，固完成其用動物之生殖腺素來補給於人體，收卻病延年返老還童之效，於是震驚了世界之醫壇，造福於人類之健康，其豐功偉績，實可與日月同輝。可是關於生殖腺的研究，近復有William　O.Puckett博士近在美國動物學會表演他的人造雌雄法，他把極幼稚喧蛙的蝌蚪，解剖其生殖腺供眾細察，指示蝌蚪在這時期的雌雄尚未分判，它們的分判期常在蝌蚪之末期，此時若把雌內分泌或雄內分泌，（生殖腺液）和喧蛙腦殼後一個小器官內的黏液腺共同注入，則愛雌內分泌的蝌蚪即變成雌性，而受雄內分泌的即成為雄性。博士屢作試騐，可以任意使它成為雌或成為雄。由這試騐的成功，就不難推廣應用於人類。誠然，一對男女結婚以後，在夫婦生活中的生男育女，與性能健康大有關係，一個精力充沛的健壯丈夫，在新婚之後，每一素得男，此外男子對於生殖腺液用種種衛生方法加以保養，使之充沛，亦每可以生男，所謂清心寡慾多男子，實亦有至理！不過，男子如果於早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後荒淫縱慾，致精關失司，性神經衰弱，爆發著滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散，腦腎虧損，健忘失眠等症，則在夫婦生活中每無法圓滿，如此，不特難以生子，即夫婦關係，恐亦難以保持，因此在家庭中每發生種種的悲劇，或竟振振有詞與夫訴請離婚者，在今日社會上亦為常有的事。至在男子的本身，既因身體衰弱，復受此種悲慘，更何以堪！因內愉上之痛苦，致病勢加劇，成未老先衰，或一病嗚呼早年殀殤者，亦是多不勝計，其危險為何似！關於治療方法。雖有多端，但據世界名醫及餘多年經騐，均公認以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症而特效。誠以此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，使男子精力充沛，夫婦愛情因以濃厚。生男育女可有把握，若能繼續服用，則不特可將男子的各種性病，完全治癒，並可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，收效尤速！若患者能來本診所就專家醫師診斷後施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，更可保證治癒。</p>
<p>青年通病</p>
<h3>自凟與遺精弊害的分析</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>在這紛亂的時代裏，到處是十字街頭，無世故經騐的青年，徬徨歧途，真是危機四伏。誘惑青年人力量最大的，莫如妖冶的女人和自身性的刺激，因為青年人是正當情竇初開性的好奇心萬分强烈，此時如沒有良好的教育和正確的指導，鮮有不為不良環境所引誘，墮入污泥深淵中。即以青年人犯有最普遍而又為社會人士漠然視之的自凟與遺精而　，其弊害的嚴重，將尤甚於洪水猛獸！第一，青年人之犯自凟者，幾至多不可勝計，真接受害者，為其自身性神經的摧殘，致精關失司，射精神經過敏，而繼起遺精。遺精一起，即等於有了漏巵，體內精液必有多量的流失，是以人體各部均呈枯耗狀態，各種虛弱症象，如腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎虧無能，即相繼而來，其個人健康與幸福的前途，即猶處在昏夜的黑暗中。第二，因對於性機能的斬傷，其婚後必不能營兩性的圓滿生活，因此，妻子的青春蹉跎，幸福斷送，直猶如把妻子送入痛苦的墳墓中。同時，他自身人生所應有幸福呢？也不知將拋送在五裡霧中或九霄雲外去了。第三，青年自幼而少，自少而至青年，其父母兄姊師長，以及社會國家所予的負擔與培植，必不在少數，以家庭言則滿望其成家立業榮宗耀祖，以上社會國家言，則滿望其能成一個建設上的技師，戰場上的忠勇將士，俾在抗戰建國的途程中獲得一個能員。然而事實上能否適應這種要求？據我們所知道，大多數的青年均沉淪在低紙興趣的自凟與淫樂中而不能自拔，能不浩嘆！自覺的青年呀！當此千載一時，人奴的關頭，我們必須要用最大的決心來解絕我們自凟與淫樂，並服最特效的良藥「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，解除射精過敏狀態而根本的治療遺精。如因遺精已引起上述癥狀者，尤須兼服生殖腺製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，則必可於短期內完全恢復健康。</p>
<h3>乳峯在愛情上的價值</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>高聳而有彈性的乳峯是健美女性的靈魂</p>
<p>高高的一對乳峯，襯著婀娜的身材，與豐腴的臂部，再加上一張白面紅潤的臉，和著柳眉櫻唇，貝齒　鼻，這樣健美的女性，不但在家庭里為丈夫尊若天人，兩性間卿卿我我，愛情特別來得濃厚，即到社會上去交際，憑她這個模樣兒，也是到處似眾星之捧月，受人熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>但是這樣的健美女性，世界上究竟還是少數，唯一的主要原因，因為女性要達到上述的那麼健美，全仗卵巢機能的充分健全，卵巢機能健全，那麼女性的特徵，即有良好的發育，最顯著者，就是乳部呈堅實而有彈性的峯狀聳起，即使穿了緊窄的衣服，它也不肯就範那麼地突出胸前，雙峯對峙，空谷幽深，這是多麼引人心醉，同時臂部亦必相當發達，加以活潑的柳腰，就形成女性最神秘而可愛的全部曲線，然此數者，衹有發育良好的女性方克享受，他如早年眈溺自凟，或因月經不調，白帶不感，病後虧弱，以致卵巢機能失健，影響新陳代謝作用者，即本來高聳的乳峯，亦會萎縮下去，健美喪失，容顏憔悴，此神女子，不但在家庭裡每為丈夫所厭惡，生育難艱，即於個人的性情方面，亦多偏狹，善感多愁，快樂幸福之神，與她無緣，因此她前途命運的悲慘！也就不堪設想了！欲求補救，衹有憑藉科學，據世界婦科用醫Oansnast康斯南氏等及餘經騐，均公認服卵巢製劑名能「生殖素」最為對症而特效，因此藥於服從即能培補卵巢女各，旺盛新陳代謝作用，如繼續服用，擔保於短期內將上述機症完全治癒，而使乳峯逐漸聳起，化醜陋為嬌艷。</p>

<h3>瀰漫性的白濁之新解救</h3>
<p>在濁毒已被新發明之特藥「大〇六」征服之後，其流行之慘烈，已遠不如從前，而代其盛行之位置者，厥為淋病一症是矣。不但如從前梅毒之流行，而且更甚於前。因淋毒之瀰漫性，在許多之通都大邑中，其患淋毒之男子，實較健全之男子為多，是無可諱言之事也。因此吾人對於淋病之療法，實不可不作徹底之研究，使此如火如荼之淋毒，作迅速之撲滅。惟如多數墨守陳法之市醫，往往死守某一種療法，如單用一種藥，或一種手術，以應付千變萬化之淋病，如何能望淋毒尅日就愈，還我人之幸福乎？現在稍具時代頭腦之醫家，其對於治療淋素，尤其是應付瀰漫性之淋病，寬覺刻不容緩之事。現在分別言之。</p>
<p>對於頑固而兼瀰漫性之白濁，診斷與療法，宜作最大努務之考究。先之以精密之診斷，判明其屬於急慢性淋中之前後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，膀胱炎等，而後用對症治療，庶幾指日可愈。例如淋毒性關節炎，睪丸炎等，必須用德國希鍈血清注射，始可消滅廣泛性之淋菌，而膀胱炎初起時以不用機械療治法為宜，惟過於難治，則可行洗滌法。攝護腺炎時可擇用振動按摩法，溫氏冷卻法，電氣按摩法，及坐藥法。世有至老專固執某一療法，某一種劣藥，以為應付者，豈非欺人之談。至於電療方法，以德國濾淋平流電療法，治療各症，更有特效。</p>

<h3>敬吿醫師同業忍痛一下解囊慨助</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>此次組織救護班，實有萬不容已之勢，發起募捐隊，實有萬不得已之情，今將事理簡短的舉在下面，凡我同業有心人，不論為本會會員與非本會會員，請詳參細思，踴躍輸將，是所至禱。</p>
<p>（一）救護計劃　豫定組織救護班，開往災區人員醫師五人，護士十人，為期一年，經費除藥物伙食另謀供給外，約一萬五千元，專供救護班十餘人之辛苦薪水。</p>
<p>（二）募捐運動　分作四十七隊，每隊十餘，分道募捐，無論本會會員及非本會會員，醫師及非醫師，均可勸其樂助。</p>
<p>以上二者，為救護班募捐隊組織之事略。</p>
<p>（三）時期所遭　吾人丁此哀鴻遍野難民滿地之非常時期，優游逍遙，作袖手旁觀之態度，於心實有未安，於分實為不宜。</p>
<p>（四）職業所迫　吾人以醫為業，古來本有不為良相願為良醫之語，謂可以救人也，現在丁此時期，更應盡量發揮救人之事，庶幾不負所事事。</p>
<p>（五）良心所驅　兵燹之災，延及十餘省，人民蕩析離居，有家而不得安，有衣食而不免凍餓，加之瘡痍未裹，貧病交迫，流離顚沛瀕於死亡者，何止數十百萬，而吾人得以幸免慘毒，偸生旦夕，苟一身尙存，此心未死，卽忍飢須臾，破囊輸將，以成樂善救災之舉，淸夜捫心自思，亦覺義不容辭也。</p>
<p>（六）衆望所屬　身為醫師，遭茲喪亂，出而擔任救護，在全國同胞心理中，雖未曾起而交謫，人人都以為當然之事，雖在上海之同人，亦頗有救國捐難民捐等種種盡力，然此究屬帮助別人之發動，非醫師本位之義舉，此次乃醫師職業本分上所應有之事。曾子曰，十目所視，十手所指，其嚴乎，况為全國人民輿情之所集，敢不知所以自愛乎？</p>
<p>以上四者，為組織救護班發起募捐隊之動機情理，兩面都無可諉，願我同業諸公，本個人之良心，量自己之能力，盡力贊助，以成斯舉，不惟本會之幸，將全國同胞實利賴之焉。</p>
<p>通俗醫話</p>
<h3>說生食</h3>
<p>— 沈恭</p>
<p>生食者卽未經過分調理之水菓或菜肴之謂。至於廣義的生食則包括生牛乳生蛋生蝦等，茲略述其優點如下：</p>
<p>生食富有維他命，故不起維他命缺乏症</p>
<p>生食可以得到大量礦質。</p>
<p>生食無攝取過量食鹽之虞，故對於腎臟，血管，神經系諸症，頗屬相宜。</p>
<p>生食無　，故對於痛風症及尿酸素質者頗有裨益。</p>
<p>生食少蛋白質，故對於腎臟炎及重症糖尿均佳。但若蛋白質不足時，則可以胡桃類，鷄蛋，牛乳等，補償之。</p>
<p>生食之容積大，食之易飽，且共熱量少，故宜於脫脂療法。</p>
<p>生食多不消化成分，大多在腸內吸收水分而增加糞便量，故宜於便秘。</p>
<p>因上述種種優點故生食宜於便秘，腎臟炎，浮腫，肥胖症，痛風，僂麻斯，神經痛，糖尿病，神經衰弱，癲癎，皮膚病等注意：生食時對於傳染病之感染，須特別注意。故家庭中備水菓時，亦宜淸洗後食之。</p>
<p>疾病常識</p>
<h3>瘦之研究</h3>
<p>— 王完白</p>
<p>在健康之男女，應具有肥瘦適度之體格，過肥過瘦，皆為病態。當二十餘歲時，尤忌瘦弱，恐伏有慢性疾病如肺核等。至四十餘歲以後，則又忌肥胖，大腹便便者，每多血壓過高，突發中風。此皆亟宜就科學醫加以檢査，及早防治，自易補救。</p>
<p>原因</p>
<p>或肥或瘦，皆應研求其原因所在，生理如經濟，入不敷出即瘦；供過於求即肥。茲將通常所見人體消瘦之原因，舉出數端於下：</p>
<p>（一）肺結核病　即肺癆病，當未見顯著症狀如盜汗咯血之前，雖已見淸瘦，患者每易忽略，務須早為查騐，免貽後悔。</p>
<p>（二）腸寄生蟲　此病患者甚多，幼年時更甚，宛如寄居之食客，將辛苦所得之滋養料，大量消耗，但檢査糞便，即可覔得證據。</p>
<p>（三）糖尿消渴　尿中含糖，極易消瘦，舊稱消渴病，然不至嚴重時期，病人多不自覺，若化騐其尿，立可發見。</p>
<p>（四）身心過勞　有人職務繁忙，飲食睡眠不足；或因遊嬉應酬，夜以繼日，亦可發同樣現象。</p>
<p>（五）消化不良　胃臟職在司納，若常患慢性胃病，則所得滋養不足，初則僅體重不增，漸乃减瘦。</p>
<p>（六）腺功缺乏　人體之新陳代謝，多賴各種腺體之內分泌，加以調節，故腺體功效缺乏時，營養即起障碍，例如小兒之胸腺萎縮，卽成小兒消瘦病。</p>
<p>以上祇就常見之原因，稍加引述，餘姑從略。</p>
<p>調理</p>
<p>消瘦之原因一經察出，自當按照病原，加以治療。若置其致病之原於不顧，但努力於滋補之藥，自無效力可言，蓋漏巵不塞，决難積聚。如極普通之腸寄生蟲，必先服藥驅除，自可恢復健康，否則徒進補藥，於事無益。除對症療治外，一般之調理方法，猶理財之開源與節流，茲亦提出數點。</p>
<p>（一）補品　體質旣瘦，自需要滋養品之補益，然須求其消化易而含生活素多者，如鮮牛乳，鮮乳酪，半熟鷄蛋，濃牛肉湯，葡萄汁，豆腐漿，白菜，橘子等。</p>
<p>（二）飲水　多飲水為致肥之新法，飲料莫妙於冷開水一日三四次，每次一二大杯，時間宜在空腹，勿與飲食接連，若習慣上不喜欽冷，則熱開水亦可。</p>
<p>（三）休息　生活繁忙之人，宜極力節勞，定時安臥休息。若小孩瘦弱甚，尤須勉令多睡於空氣日光充分之處。但勞心而不勞力之人，則應有適當之運動。</p>
<p>（四）按摩　若皮膚乾燥，四肢瘦削之人，每日應為之塗抹橄欖油，同時加以摩擦，上下肢與軀體前後各部，宜分時輪流行之。</p>
<p>（五）服藥　內服藥劑，自須醫師診察處方，勿宜胡亂購服。若平常之調理，最經濟而實惠者，莫如淸魚肝油，成人每飯後可服一湯匙，小孩酌减。</p>
<p>（六）注射　注射藥為科學方法中最大之貢獻，然必須由正式醫師主持執行。如關乎內分泌之臟器製劑，於人體之新陳代謝，影響至鉅，用之得當，自有特效末後一點，需要精神上之涵養，蓋自古多愁必多病，心廣乃體胖，吾人能內無自責之憂，外有益人之樂，實獲得健康之最高衛生法也。</p>

<p>我也聽見人說，為什麼我的家人多病痛，使我吃盡護持的痛苦。我也對他說，你這樣的護持，也是你的權利。</p>
<p>我又時常揣測某種人的心理，以為自己很不幸，生在老弱的中國，不生在强盛的外國。我總要暗示他們，我們生而為中國人，正是我們的權利。</p>
<p>到底也時常有人慨嘆着說，不生於上古的太平盛世，不生於將來的和平樂世，而偏偏生於這二十世紀國際風雲變幻的亂世，實屬不幸。我不免又要向他解釋，生今變幻之世，恰是我們的權利。</p>
<p>總之，凡是人世問一切痛苦，不幸，任何挫折，打擊，在我看來，都是我們的權利。</p>
<p>為什麼呢？</p>
<p>第一，人是有獨佔慾的。這一切種種，旣為我所獨佔，他人不能分潤，此非權利而何！</p>
<p>第二，人是有創造慾的。可是糊裏糊塗而死於安樂者，不知多少。這一切種種，正作了他山之石，使我們成為孟子所說的天將降以「大任」的人物，向上有所發展，牠們玉成我們，當然是我們所享的特別權利。</p>
<p>因此，反過來說，假使一個人所生的環境，家族國家和時代都在內，樣樣都很舒適，不須他勞一分力，費一毫心，那末，我可以說，這人就要失去生的意義，不過是行屍走肉而已，他所享受的，根本算不得權利，只是在盡消耗與排洩的義務。</p>
<p>原來人生只是奮鬥，只是前進。奮鬥與前進的機會，就是我們的權利！</p>
<h3>洪秀全演義</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>—民族小說話</p>
<p>洪秀全演義二集二十九回，燕京大學藏有石印本，番禺黃小配撰。首丙午（光緒三十二年）章炳麟序，又自序，題「黃帝紀元四千六百零六年」，可見此最初的二十九回原作是宣統元年寫的，這時離武昌起義只有兩年。章炳麟又是提倡革命甚烈的，那末，此書的民族意識，不看也就知道是正確的了。記得民國肇建，我在蕪湖，那時只有十歲，看見街坊上盛行着一種三十六開狹長的油光紙的本子，假西裝，就是現今通行的平裝，封面是綠色的薄紙，上端大書「洪秀全」三字，畫三個圓圈，印黑色，除字外，下面還有一張線條的圖畫。每本薄薄的二三十頁，好像至少有初二集。</p>
<p>但是，現在的通行本改為「洪楊豪俠傳」，已經增至一百四十回，把原書延長為四倍了。我想，這後加的一百十一回，從第五十五回起，該是遜淸遺老所加的，如第七十八回回目有「洪逆君臣全行斃命，曾家弟兄盡沐恩榮」，這是多末刺目的字眼！洪秀全則稱為逆，曾國藩等則稱為沐恩，眞可說是顚倒黑白。我讀過以後，覺得就是文字上，也是前五十四回較好。如寫李秀成的戰術，極為巧妙而有興趣。且有書卷氣，如第三十回的「石達開詩退曾國藩」，即用石達開的原信和原詩五首，這是可以與毛宗崗在三國演義上所加的名人詩句媲美的。阿英的晚淸小說史云：「黃小配的洪秀全演義，惜乎做到五十四回就中止了，且出版期巳在淸社覆滅以後。」</p>
<p>這部小說仔細考證起來，不但篇幅不允許，我也沒有這樣的餘暇和能力。大約簡又文和謝興堯是最能勝任的，因為他們倆是太平天國研究的專家。簡又文著有「太平天國雜記」，謝興堯著有「太平天國史事論叢」。此外的參考材料有李秀成的供狀，石達開的日記，太平天國詩文鈔，太平天國有趣文件（劉復編），太平天國外紀，太平天國野史等等，眞是數都數不盡，至少可以消磨研究者好幾年的光陰。在創作方面，除了洪秀全演義以外，近人陳白慶是最喜歡取材於此的，我曾介紹他去見過簡謝二專家，他的「金田村」一名「太平天國」曾經得到舞台上的成功，「石達開之死」似乎還不會上演過，也許是為了悲劇的氣分較重，不合於積極抗戰的現時代吧？電影和平劇也都用過太平天國的史事作為題材。我希望將來能有詳細硏討的機會。</p>
<h3>如何把這兩座偶像搬出去？</h3>
<p>— 何漢作</p>
<h3>談「冷」與「熱」</h3>
<p>— 鐵牛</p>
<p>『冷』與『熱』，這是兩個絕對相反的形容詞，通常究竟有着怎樣的標準，才算恰合乎牠們字面上的身份呢？回答的是：『冷熱是比較中得到標準。』</p>
<p>這里就可分別『冷』『熱』的路綫：熱情與冷酷，熱血與冷血，狂熱與冷靜，熱鬧與冷落。要是以『人生』來作譬喩，那末，大概兒童時期是熱中於『游戲』而冷於『戀愛』，少年時代是熱中於『戀愛』而冷於『游戲』，中年時代是熱中於『名利』而冷於『戀愛』，老年時代是熱中於『安逸享福』而對游戲，戀愛，名利都冷淡了。</p>
<p>中國現在所需要的是懷着熱烈的情緒，捧着一顆赤紅的心而壯烈地流出了鮮紅炙熱的血，把一切獻給抗戰中的靑年。中國所不需要的是冷酷無情。</p>
<p>『熱漲冷縮』，這是物理學的定律，但在中國却失去了牠一半的作用。在中國每一個角落都燃起了抗戰的烽火的今日，後方民衆，儘管天氣是怎樣的嚴寒酷冷，他們對祖國盡忠的熱心，却是到了最高度。為了敵人砲火的摧燬而流離顚沛着的難胞們身上沒穿棉衣，被凛冽的朔風所侵襲，却反能把反抗的熱力鼓勵起來。</p>
<p>再譬如在前綫吧：在冰天雪地中浴血抗戰，任天氣是怎般的冷，但勇士們同仇敵愾英勇抗戰的一顆心中正熱烘烘的沸騰着熱血。</p>
<p>每一個人都需要『熱』，但過熱了有時會發『冷』。要是覺得身體熱起來時，熱得汗出如瀋，冷的時候冷得上下牙打顫，這『忽冷忽熱』『冷熱無常』，就可斷定你已患了『冷熱病』，須得急請大夫診察，服幾顆『金鷄納霜丸』，把『瘧疾菌』驅逐出境才是。</p>
<p>同樣的，某種國家需要熱烈而又勇武的軍部，需要頭腦冷靜的政治家，彼此有着密切的連帶關係，否則，就失去了『』『熱』的調劑與中和。如果熱起來時，軍部就橫衝直撞；冷了，冷得勇士們都『厭戰』『上弔』，這樣的『忽熱忽冷』『冷熱無常』，就造成了國家的『冷熱病』。但這可不能請一個大夫診斷就可了事，須得由患『冷熱病』的國家的人民深深地覺到自己國家已病入膏肓，再不急起挽救，勢必同歸於盡，那末就應該聯合被軍閥壓迫下的大衆，擎起了反抗的大　，把法西斯的癮疾菌—軍閥—消滅個精光。</p>
<h3>島居三部曲</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>送別</p>
<p>淸晨－這大都市正揉着惺忪的睡眼，街上僅有幾個行人，我拖着沉重的步子，伴送朋友到船上。我們都好像有千言萬語要傾述，却又都默默不語，勉勵的話，惜別的話……都悄悄地吞下了，積壓在心上，像是一塊鉛。</p>
<p>「到那邊來信，」我說。</p>
<p>「在這兒好好地幹下去，」朋友的話。</p>
<p>眼圈都有點紅潤，晶瑩的淚珠在滾動，却未下墮。互道珍重之後，我們親切而又殘酷地說了聲再見。</p>
<p>粗大的烟突，在寗靜蔚藍的天空上，噴了一陣黑霧，裊裊地盤旋上升，逐漸地疏散流盪開去，淡了。龐大的船身也已化這一個小小的黑影，終於消失在視綫外了。駛回遼闊的海洋，自由的海岸，把渴望鬥爭的人們載回祖國的原野。</p>
<p>蹀蹼於碼頭上，像是尋找着自己的路。「又走了一個，」我喃喃的自語着。</p>
<p>噩夢</p>
<p>蜿蜓起伏的峯巒，像是沒有盡頭似的向前爬去，佈滿雜亂的荊棘，崢嶸的怪石。陡峭的山峽，切出一條細長而又深邃的澗，澗水奏着悽惻的輓歌－在哀悼那些不幸的失足者。</p>
<p>暮色低低的壓下來，一團黑影緩緩的往前移動—是一支行進中的游擊隊伍，但不知是凱旋歸來，抑是去做夜襲。戰士們都默默地，小心翼翼的在趕路。「崖下是無底的深淵呀，」人們都這麼警惕着，而全副精神也都凝注於趕路上了</p>
<p>「啊喲，」聲音隨着一個黑影迅速地墮下了。</p>
<p>「是平！」—朋友的名字，不知誰在說。</p>
<p>「是平？」我急促又驚訝地問。</p>
<p>駭得渾身是汗，睜開眼，一片漆黑，原來是一塲噩夢。</p>
<p>來鴻</p>
<p>朶朶的流雲，在蒼空急駛，我正想問他朋友的訊息，而郵差已帶來平的音信—魔手下的幸運兒，但却也夾雜着濃烈的血腥味了。</p>
<p>「×，你好，我很快樂的活着」—似是針對着我的噩夢而寫，「我們巳和敵人接觸過兩次了，弟兄們一個也沒有喪亡，共斃敵九名，獲得很多軍械和軍需，我分到一件黃呢的大衣……」</p>
<p>在幻想中，我彷彿看見了一幕戰鬥的塲面：平跟無數的戰士們在追擊着潰竄的敵人，矮鬼一個個的倒下了，膏藥旗幟懶洋洋的躺在地下，和冷冰冰的泥土做一次乏味的擁抱。原野上招展着靑天白日滿地紅。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>正午時候，獨眼李果然帶同蕭麻子來赴宴了。他表面上並沒有帶什麼護衛，但暗中混進來接應的黨徒却已不少，大都潛伏在鄕公所對面的小茶館裹。葉團長全副戎裝，佩着短劍，出來接見獨眼李，並且伸出他那戴着白手套的手，和獨眼李握了一下，很慇懃的請他們入席。</p>
<p>席上並沒有多少人，只有葉團長和梁團附兩個。這也是葉團長早就佈置好了的，惟恐其他的人缺少涵養，在神色間露了馬脚，給獨眼李看出破綻，反致僨事。</p>
<p>這一席宴上的人物，可說極不相稱。葉團長和梁團附畢竟都是正規軍官，威風凜凜，氣宇軒昂，獨眼李和蕭麻子却是鹽梟土匪出身，形容猥瑣，舉止粗獷。不過有一點是相同的，就是兩邊都具有深刻的戒心。</p>
<p>梁團附在席上斟過了一巡酒，葉團長便舉起杯子來，向獨眼李和蕭麻子照了一照。兩個人雖也照樣舉起了杯子，却似乎怕酒裹下了毒，你望着我我望着你，都不敢喝。葉長團哈哈一笑，一口氣喝乾了一杯酒，放下杯子，正色對獨眼李說：</p>
<p>『現在國難這樣嚴重，敵人的殘暴，已經滅絕了人性，我們都是黃帝子孫，擺在我們眼前的只有一條生路，就是抗戰。我們大家應該不問過去如何，務須一致努力，執行民族統一戰綫，奉行國策，和我們的民族敵人，拚命抗戰到底。』</p>
<p>說着，他那不怒而威的眼珠，稜稜有光的不住在獨眼李和蕭麻子兩人臉上掃射，兩人似乎都有些氣懾，只是點頭不迭。</p>
<p>葉團長略微停了一會，又說：</p>
<p>『我也知道你們的隊伍實力很强，不過目前最要緊的事是統一編制和指揮，所謂分則刀散，合則力强，所以我希望你們的隊伍能够加進我們中間來，和我們合作，重新改編過，給養和薪餉都和我們一樣，我决不會虧待你們。至於改編的詳細計劃，我已預備好在這里。』</p>
<p>一面說，一面便伸手到軍服口袋裹去。獨眼李和蕭麻子臉色一變，也都把手伸到了腰間，後來見葉團長掏出來的是一張紙頭，這纔放下了心。（二六）</p>

<h3>星相家的妙用</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>日本軍閥，素來用一種麻醉手段，鼓勵人民侵略的野心，所以「護身符」「千人針」一類的東西，便是他們神道設教，愚弄其民的無上法寳，這種手段的卑劣愚愼，實等於西太后利用「義和團，」以為槍砲可以不入，刀火可以不傷，同一可笑。</p>
<p>最近更異想天開，發明一個欺騙民衆的新法子，昨據路透電「東京業星相者三十人，經警廳長訓話後，已組織公會，並决令在此對華作戰之緊急時期中，對於來問前途禍福者，鼓勵其樂觀」、這種卑陋庸惡的辦法，非但可笑，實是可憐。以偌大的東京，僅僅三十名相士，分配恐嫌不够，幷且迷信之徒，前來請問禍福者，該星相家可以隨便說謊，任意胡謅，假定東京人民，並不來問前途禍福，則該星相家英雄無用武之地，無可說謊，則如之何？在這裏，我還可以獻一個補充的辦法。</p>
<p>只要警廳長下一命令：（一）凡住居東京的人民，均須至星相家處問卜休咎，如不到星相家處問休咎者，當作蘊藏反動思想論。（二）凡住居東京之人民，不問男女老小，均須身佩「批命書」一紙，如我國游擊區域之人民，必須有「通行證」「牛痘證」「防疫證」一樣，倘檢查人民身畔，或人家無「批命書」者，得以大逆不道論。如此日本人民的厭戰思想，便無從發生，幷且可以根本剷除，這豈不是一個絕妙的方法。</p>
<p>但是星相家的原則，是「問災不問福」的，假定東京的星相家，根據星相家的原則，如「張鐵口」「李鐵嘴」，同樣老實，一本直奏，不稍隱瞞，我恐東京的人民，要全部動搖起來，日本全國的火藥庫，多要像大阪一樣的危險，卽使星相家，能奉令承教，如法泡製，但自開戰以來，二十個月，貨物一天一天膨脹，經濟一天一天緊縮，人口一天一天减少，孀婦一天一天增多，陣亡將士「榮譽」的公墓，到處皆是，壯士的死灰，從兵艦中連續不斷的運送回來，在這種情形之下，我想這般星相家，雖口若懸河，說得怎樣天花亂墜，在東京的人民，到底有些不能相信罷？故此種辦法，徒見其心勞日拙而已。我於此看出日本軍閥的無聊，與手脚的忙亂。</p>
<h3>忠肝義膽</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“Arkansas　Traveler”</p>
<p>派拉蒙出品　國泰戲院映</p>
<p>在最近獻映的許多小片子中間，我們不得不特別舉出，像「忠肝義膽」這樣淸暢樸質，而又同時具有教育戰鬥性的影片，介紹於本報讀者之前。</p>
<p>這影片，可以說具有多樣性的特點：</p>
<p>第一，它教我們應當怎樣沉着地去戰鬥—在故事裹，作者透過了潛伏的熱情，用了很生動的筆觸，介紹了兩個非常堅强有力的人物：（一）是一個先怕事逃避，而後來變成一個不逃避現實，懂得怎樣向惡勢力鬭爭的靑年，雖然他經過了許多困難與暗礁，但是最後，他是勝利了：（二）一個辦事沉着而且很有計劃的中年人，他對事實看得很淸楚，不衝動，不馬虎，有步驟，有秩序的，沉着地戰鬥下去，結果他克服了一切困難。</p>
<p>第二，在藝術性上的成就—這個表現了優美戲劇形式的「阿州漂泊者」的故事，它在劇本編製及全劇中心的描寫上，它是非常成功的；它成功的原因，可以舉出三點：（一）劇本的編製很緊凑；它介紹人物的出塲很活潑優美；（二）背景為美國一個小鎭，因此它很樸實而富有眞實感；（三）幾個主要人物，都很堅實而樸質；那個不知姓氏的流浪人；那個年靑電氣工程師；那個慈祥懂得怎樣奮鬥的媽媽。，那個天眞無邪年靑的弟弟；那個曾一時惑於虛榮的「年方及筓」的姊姊；這四個人物，在作者細膩，活潑的彫鑒之下，他們都給了我們一個極溫和，可愛的形像。</p>
<p>但全劇最可愛的，我以為還是劇本能够前後呼應，當年靑電氣工程師約翰，預備逃避的時候，那位中年流浪人假以竊表的罪名使鎮上的警官把他捉回來，使他留在鎭上繼續奮鬥；到全劇結束，當他們無綫電臺建立完成，他們改選了市長，報紙又照常出版的時候，那位流浪人預備悄悄地離開鎭上的時候，約翰也一樣以偷表的罪名，把流浪人拖回來；觀衆看到這裹，沒有不哄堂大笑的。</p>
<p>第三，應當推論這位導演的技術了—本片導演的名字，我們好像沒有看見過；但是，他却能在這充滿了眞摯的感情與熱力裹面，通過了觀衆的情感。</p>
<p>我覺得本片導演有一個最大的好處，是情感氣氛把握得異常强烈，他不僅僅是使人接受劇中情緒，同時，它能使我們非常感動。比如：（一）當無綫電裏建築之初，由火車上加來上百個工人，他們載運了各種工程材料，工人們手裹揑着火把，當他們穿過街道的時候，穿了睡衣的男人女人，推開窗來，有許多很快地奔到街上來，這市鎮，是為這個建築無綫電臺的工程所騷動了。在這一個騷動的塲面裹面，却包含着多少熱情興同感的顏臉，—導演者在這些塲合裹，氣氛情感表現得異常優美。（二）無綫電臺建築完成了，流浪人，媽媽，約翰三個人的演講，市鎭上每個角落裹的聽衆，興奮，激動，靜靜地聽着播音；，電臺上，媽媽感動得要哭出來；約翰以一番激烈的演講辭，攻擊當地的政客及市長，（他的父親）流浪人以詼諧的語調使聽衆們發出哄聲大笑。這些優良的效果，都是經過了導演卓越簡潔的畫面編織，而收穫到這樣優秀的成績的。</p>
<p>演員主耍有四個，那是鮑勃彭斯（流浪人），茀拜脫兒（媽媽），約翰皮爾（電氣工程師），瓊派克（女兒），狄克摩亞（弟弟），都演得純熟而眞切．</p>
<h3>噱頭</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>噱頭在這個年頭，到處用得着，也到處要用得着。假使你沒有噱頭，或者你想不出噱頭，那麼你休想在你的社會裹鬥爭，或者生存。為了這，噱頭朋友，隨處皆有；噱頭故事，層出不窮。有些噱頭朋友，已經噱出世了，有些噱頭朋友，還正在拚命地想噱頭。演出的噱頭，有可歌的，也有可泣的</p>
<p>噱頭的意思，便是新奇。所謂新奇；便是不落舊套。所以噱頭需要具有超越的思想，或者行動的條件。具備這樣的條件，纔能表現出新奇的思想，和新奇的行動。也唯有能够這樣，纔能動人聽聞，纔能獲得勝利。然而噱頭之來，不但需要噱頭朋友具有相當的本能，還要配合空閒的和時間的要求，否則，你噱你的，人家是不會理睬你的，結果，噱頭宣告失敗，而你也隨之坍台•所以，聰明乖巧的，技術高深的噱頭朋友，在想噱頭的時候，自會審察空間的和時間的需耍，倘然遇着障碍，他還會造成適合噱頭的空間和時間。於是噱天噱地，噱其所噱。從這裹，我們可以得到一個結論。．噱頭的成功，貴乎具備空閒性和時間性；而噱頭的失敗，便在它的空間性和時間性的消失。可憐那些幼稚的朋友，為要表示他的能耐，開展他的鴻猷，也費盡心計，絞盡腦汁的在想噱頭，然而他缺乏主觀的條件，否認客觀的事實，難怪要遭遇失敗的命運了。</p>
<p>噱頭在某種塲合，或者為了某種事件，稍會或者偶然施展些，似乎也未可厚非；但是它誘致來的，却是社會麻痺性的加深，這是實在可怕的。因為噱頭不僅需耍以新奇制勝，而且需要以刺激克敵。不斷的標新炫奇，不斷的刺激逗引，自必招致人心的麻木。因此我們認為：噱頭常用在商業上，是會促成信譽的墮落；倘然常用在一般工作上，是會促使對工作信念的喪失，馴至會演成惡性的變化。為了工作，為了事業，噱頭是斷乎不可常用的。不料現在噱頭朋友依舊不肯放棄他的噱頭政策，繼續地在製造噱頭，堆成了現在的噱頭社會，噱頭世界！正是：</p>
<p>噱頭不死，大禍不止！</p>
<h3>蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 也農</p>
<p>養蜂是我國固有的事業，在漢晋時，養蜂的方法，已有發明，祗因墨守成法，不知研究和改良，致蜂種混雜，品質窳劣，產蜜不多，而飼養者復聽其自生自滅，逃亡者不知收捕，衰弱者不知補救，致數千來年，毫無進步，良可嘆惜！</p>
<p>養蜂在歐美各國，都視為一種重要的實業，並由政府極力提倡，成績斐然，就拿美國來說，自從積極提倡養蜂以來，養蜜蜂的人，已有一百多萬，有蜜蜂一千五百多萬箱，每年產出的蜂蜜，値到八千數百萬元美金，副產品的蜂蠟，也値到四百多萬元的美金。觀乎我國，幅員廣大，氣候溫和，花草繁盛，十足是一個很合宜的養蜂的地方，將來如能普遍提倡，那眞是一種很有希望的事業呢。</p>
<p>我們不要小視了蜜蜂，牠雖然是一種小小的昆蟲，但我們仔細去考察一下蜂羣的內容，眞是使我們佩服。牠們能够自己營造整齊而美觀的六角形的巢房，有蜂王專事生殖，工蜂負外勤的採蜜工作，淸潔巢房，養育幼蟲，所以巢箱以內，非常淸潔。若外敵來侵，則羣起而攻，雖死亡枕藉，前仆後繼，非至最後勝利不止。蜜蜂的知覺是非常的靈敏，性情也是十分的勇敢，工作也很勤奮。牠的組織，有秩序，有團結，有精神，好似一個完備的社會組織。而有許多地方，恐怕人類還不及牠呢！</p>
<p>養蜂是一種最有興趣的事情，假使一面做事，，一面養蜂，作為一種副業，祇要在蜜源豐富的地方，如果大家來飼養四五羣，每年產收之蜜，也可以代替外來的砂糖了。</p>
<p>我國江浙兩省過去產出的蜜，共有二種：一為松江的紫芸英蜜，一為桐鄕的烏柏蜜，前者蜜色潔白，可供食用，後者色如琥珀，可代糖用，現在上海冠生園之陳皮梅，及各種糖果餅乾，多用蜜製，因為取其價廉而滋養的緣故。</p>
<p>戰前，在江浙一帶，我國也有許多民營的養蜂塲，規模偉大，設備完全，每年蜂蜜的產址，約有二千多擔，較之美國，雖是小巫之見大巫，但是我國每年因購買砂糖，而流出國外之數千萬元的漏巵，卽已無形挽回了。</p>
<p>國軍西遷後，淪陷在游擊區的蜂塲，多被燬於砲火，就是完好的，也被盜竊一空，蜂羣也散失無遺，就是將來再事復興，而損失已是不貲了。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜滿蠡湖</p>
<p>朱愛人笑道：『我們這位吳教授，不但是當過大小姐，她還當過大少爺嗎？』吳君素也笑道：『朱醫師在挑眼兒了。我是連類而及，實在我那時年紀還小，也不曾當過大小姐。倒是我家有幾位叔叔姑姑，他們曾享過一些舒服日子。家裹反正一年的進款，儘足够用。每年從田上的租米，收進若干，到了霜降節邊，家裹開倉收租了。城裹人家，不收租米，折成市價，鄕下人自會陸續的到城裹來還租米，這一年的收入，也就可觀。此外我們還有市房，出租給人家，每月可以收取租金。我們也還開有店舖，什麼錢莊咧，布店咧醬園咧，也有好幾家。大槪這些店鋪，都可以賺錢，不過多賺些，少賺些罷了。因此我們家裹的人，無論老的少的，不必謀什麼工作，都可以在家坐食。年紀稍為老的人，不必說了，男的吸鴉片，女的义麻雀。就是年靑的人，照例應該求學，但難得有幾位專心求學的人。這裹頭要算我的父親，他是潛心向學的人，我的母親，她也是高中畢業的人，此外我們的幾位叔叔，名為在學校中念書，却是三日曬網，四日扳　·有的連學校中也不去，每日吃了中飯，坐了很漂亮的包車，—那時蘇州汽車還沒有流行。—車鈴丁丁當當的，一個精壯的車夫，拉了車子，飛快的到觀前街來，道也算是出風頭。蘇州城裹，最繁華熱鬧的一條街，在元妙觀前，喚做觀前街，好像上海的南京路一般。觀前街色色都有，或是看看電影，或是吃茶聽書，歸家時買些糖果茶食，約幾個朋友，打打小牌，這一天就算過去了。女的呢，像我們幾位姑姑，她們最關心的，是近來什麼衣服最時髦，什麼頭髮的樣子最摩登？樣樣都要取法乎上海，上海的裝式是什麼都好。她們一點沒有什麼事，便到上海去跑一趟，為的是觀察上海什麼服裝是最流行。我那時還小，不甚注意什麼，只聽得她們在討論長旗袍，短族袍。關於頭髮，又有什麼水浪式，飛機式，辛博生夫人式，我簡直弄也不淸楚。連我也被她們裝扮起來，穿了洋娃娃式的短衣裙，露出了一段腿子。』（五四）</p>

<p>前聯華公司總理馳明佑與前聯華廠長黎民偉，聯合港中敎會主敎，合行創組眞光影片公司，專以攝製宣揚上帝偉大之宗教影片，旋以教會方面持每片必須百分之百為宗教宣傳質素成見，難以如此難獲大衆興趣，提出娛樂與宣傳各半意見，但為敎會所反對，事遂僵持。羅乃另與黎籌組國際影業公司，聘名導演費穆擔任編導，第一片已定攝「人類的呼聲」亦含宗敎氣味，蓋羅近已入基督教，每週至敎堂虔誠做禮拜，費之思想亦受薰陶，「人類呼聲」擬攝英語片，但資本尙成問題，故開攝之期未决</p>
<p>林樹森登台以來，以第三日夜所表演全本三國志營業為最盛，未至七時，全院即吿滿座，林一人兼飾魯肅，孔明，關公三角，極其賣力，是晚港中伶影界人到者亦多，薛覺先唐雪卿特送橫額一幅，上書「國防戲劇眞精神」七字，其他送花籃，橫額者亦不在少。林曾招待香港報界，記者於席上詢其來港感想，林答：「此次來港，純係老友厚誼敦請，不便辭絕，但我此來自當站在本身崗位上，演唱較有意義的歷史劇，這我以為不僅是國家多事之秋的今日，在太平盛世的時候，我們也應該向着前面走的，……在　演完之後，打算到星加坡，小呂宋等處一行，因為平劇在海外演出的機會很少，故此番我决到海外去，藉戲劇警惕功能，以收宣傳實效」。</p>
<p>藝華公司歷史片「楚霸王」自廢年初一至五日在娛樂戲院放映早塲一塲，營業亦佳，國語片近在港之售座，往往超過粵語片，蓋留港外省人仕甚多，粵語片格於言語，外片或所不喜，港中娛樂塲所以影院居多，故一逢國語片來，咸趨之若騖。</p>
<p>華南影界近亦盛行拍攝國語片，或於粵語之外，兼攝粵語拷貝，或將粵語片重新配加國語，擬向上海探求出路，惟港幣與國幣價格相去幾達一倍，以港幣之成本，每片運到上海之稅收，須在千元左右，故是否合算，尙不可料，目前都在嘗試性質也，李麗主演之國語片「一代尤物」，成本耗港幣約二萬元，折國幣四萬元弱，該片之目的，在求上海之營業市塲，代理該片發行事宜之華盛公司張偉燾（亦即新華，藝華等公司香港發行代表），曾為此片在申出映事，專誠至申接洽，聯藝公司企求該片在上海一地之收入，得國幣三萬元，能否如願，亦未可料。</p>
<p>滬上某公司近有函敦請黎灼灼，張翼返滬拍片，然黎張均無意離港，蓋此間天氣溫和，現已僅着單薄夾衣（粵人早着單布衣褲），游泳季節瞬即到來（其實港地冬季中游泳者亦多），黎張均嗜好於此，反正積蓄甚豐，香港縱無戲拍，二三年之生活費用，已不成間題，故皆樂不思蜀也。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二二）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>精忠廟被香火道人侵佔的秘聞</p>
<p>長庚而後，劉趕三·兪菊生•譚鑫培等，先後繼任廟首，依然是蕭規曹隨，遵守着大老板手定的規章，一直沒有多大的變化，不過廟裹的產業，却較前增添許多了。民國後廟首改稱梨園公會會長，老譚等相繼物化，老輩中聲望較著的僅有小樓。瑤卿。鳳卿諸人，後來生行衰落，四大名旦勢派日大，素有領袖慾的尙王爺（小雲）培植個人勞力，又有一位得力的琴師名呌趙彥魁（趙四），替他出謀定計，拉攏同行的前輩，同時小雲又眞能濟困扶危，有時竟當當去援助貧老的同行，因此選舉會長時，老是他蟬聯下去，據說暗中帮助小雲活動，乘機拆散伶界團結力的最有力者，就是精忠廟的香火道師徒。諺云「鶴蚌相爭，漁人得利」，原來守廟的焦老道同他的二徒弟何某，早就存了個霸佔廟產的野心，以前因為當廟首的都不時到廟中查勘一番，辦事又很為認眞，因此他們是不敢作此想的，民國以來，如老譚等嗜好極深，起身又遲，那有閑工夫管這些己身以外的瑣事，從此廟裹就不常有人蒞臨，每逢遇着年節或發生甚麼大事，都由老道師徒分頭向梨園行幾個頭目人家裹報告一下，就算完啦，及至梨園公會正式成立，又在櫻桃斜街造了一所新會址，裹邊設了各部分的辦事處，自此以後，凡有甚麼商量的事項，都到這邊來啦，焦老道有的是錢，拿些出來，一面結交官塲，廣收門徒（安淸弟子），一面替他二徒弟請了一位冬烘先生，無事時也常談談戲，報告點梨園消息，羣强及實事白話報上雖不時看見小老道何某的名字，但是實際上他却不能，認識幾個字，完全都是人家代作的，年復一年的，北平評劇界裹居然也算一份子啦。伶界人對他師徒那裹還敢拿香火道人看待他們呢？他們更有一種好手腕，就是甚麼角紅啦，就同甚麼角認乾親，常馬連良前幾年聲譽鵲起的時候，焦老道就收他做乾兒子，隨便連良住津漢各埠演唱，老道總是自備旅費的跟着捧他。</p>
<h3>蒨蒨室劇話</h3>
<p>— 肖傖</p>
<p>今之言花衫者，必舉王瑤卿為一代宗匠，瑤卿門墻桃李以數十計，尤以梅蘭芳程硯秋兩伶為最得意。瑤卿晚年厄於嗓音，而境遇又不見佳，不得已乃以藝事指示後進，頗能因材而施，適其性而循循善誘之。蘭芳硯秋，雖不盡師瑤卿，而皆能各展其個性，順序漸進，邁往直前，得造成今日之地位。其由蘭芳硯秋自己努力不懈者，殊値得吾人稱許，即謂為梅程兩氏之得有今日，得力於瑤卿之提携，亦無不可也。以言梅程兩氏之長，梅之做，揣摩工深，以細膩熨貼著，歌則淸脆柔和，而又寬亮純正，不失宮音，溫潤可愛，甜爽婉媚兼而有之，惟欠缺剛音，其歌令人生愛，令人可喜，而獨不能令人驚奇•白口爽朗動人，最為響堂，內行稱其道白亦在工字調，海內一人而已。硯秋以態度端凝靜嫻，行腔綿邈委宛，表情蘊藉，無些微輕浮態著稱，程之唱，以悲劇擅勝塲，其歌幽誕咽嗚，哀苦凄絕，能傳人垂淚，故愛聽新腔及硏究腔調者，類喜暢聆程腔。然程腔過哀，實非宮音，此論在程氏本人亦深知之，梅程兩人之唱，可說各有所長，在音節上說，以梅為勝，以腔調言，程氏獨善創新聲，吾人正不必强為分別軒輊也。蘭芳在民初以迄今日足稱梨園驕子，硯秋踵起，亦能拔戟自樹一幟，今之習花衫者，不入於梅，便入於程，即有宗法他派者，其所表露，亦必含有若干成分為梅為程，可無疑也。坤旦之中，習梅者允推雪艷琴，（彼兼擷慧生小雲之長）其刀馬與花旦，亦遠在遏雲友琴諸人之上，坤旦中之祭酒也。習程者推新艷秋，其餘兼採梅程兩氏之長而據為已有者，當數章遏雲。章伶於梅程之腔，新舊俱擅，其道白一宗畹華，身段動作，則兼法梅程兩氏，其眉目傳情處，又以程氏為法，其水袖工夫甚佳，跑圓塲之工穩，及圓塲後來一屁股墊子，均確有眞實工夫，為他人所不能及。遏雲在昔年，多以畹華為典則，自延穆鐵芬為琴師後，其唱工與表情，乃改趨程派，今日而言坤伶旦角，不得不推遏雲為第一。遏雲得靜嫻二字，而新艷秋得秀逸二字，非餘子所能企及也。</p>

<h3>Employees Arrested at Mentougou Station</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: Chinese guerrillas in the area of Xizhimen and Mentougou in Beiping have spread vast influence. Because the PingSui and PingHan Railways have been repeatedly destroyed and military trains have been overturned multiple times, and the Japanese forces stationed in Mentougou have repeatedly been attacked, it is believed that the stationmaster of Mentougou Station, Yan Shuzhao, the deputy stationmaster, Su Fangqin, and over twenty other employees are cooperating with the guerrillas.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Daladier's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The French Socialist Party held a meeting yesterday, where prominent party member and former Minister of the Interior, Tao Ermo (陶爾謨), vehemently criticized the current foreign policy of the Daladier government. Tao loudly proclaimed: "The policy promoted by Foreign Minister Bonnet is a policy of humiliation, weakening France's position on the one hand, but inevitably leading France down the path to war on the other. The resulting outcome will merely provide France with a future war under even more unfavorable conditions." Observing the current international situation and France's position, Tao's words are truly a "penetrating" critique of Daladier's policies and deserve deep contemplation by every French individual.</p>
<p>Could France's position be more dangerous than it is today? Since the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia has become a vassal of Hitler, and Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and others have exhibited centrifugal tendencies. The Little Entente, a network of satellite states that France had cultivated for twenty years, is almost completely shattered, and France is already in a position of isolation. However, the Daladier government still follows Chamberlain, continuing its "non-intervention" policy towards Spain, ultimately leading to Italy and Germany increasing their influence in Spain, placing the Spanish government in dire straits. The flames on the Iberian Peninsula have finally approached the borders of France. At this time, the Daladier government even simply followed Britain in recognizing Franco. Now, if we open a map: Hitler looms large to the east, Mussolini eyes us from the southeast corner, and Franco, a puppet of Italy and Germany, has emerged to the southwest. France is tightly surrounded on three sides.</p>
<p>French politicians often use the phrase "Italian and German fascists are not to be feared" to comfort the people, but Mussolini explicitly acknowledged in Genoa last May that "Italy and France are opposed in Spain." Daladier and others lightly dismissed the gravity of this statement and paid no attention to the fact that German and Italian armaments were continuously supplying Franco, merely stating to the people in a perfunctory manner: "The non-intervention policy can safeguard peace." Now, we are finally about to see the evil consequences they have created.</p>
<p>The Munich Conference did not bring peace, even Chamberlain, the protagonist, has unintentionally admitted this. Otherwise, why would he still repeatedly say in the House of Commons, "If war breaks out, Britain will stand by France's side?" France's appeasement diplomacy towards the fascists is clearly built on cloudy hopes. Daladier and his ilk are calculating that if France sacrifices the interests of Central and Southeastern Europe, it may be easier to protect the interests of its colonial empire.</p>
<p>In truth, France's European interests and its imperial interests are inseparable, because fascist aggression is indivisible. Fascist aggression in Central Europe is merely the initial stage of realizing larger-scale aggression and division.</p>
<p>France is not only facing the threat of a fascist front on its northern Rhine border, but it is also facing fascist threats in Africa, and even in Annam. The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is only a hundred and several dozen miles from Haiphong. In Africa, Italy has concentrated 100,000 troops in Libya, and large quantities of gasoline and food are being stored. 450 aircraft and 4,000 pilots have been dispatched there. Blackshirts and aircraft are concentrating in an area 125 miles from the borders of French Somaliland. According to yesterday's Reuter's telegram, the Italian Mediterranean Fleet's air squadron and the aircraft carrier Miraglia have arrived in Tripoli. All of this is probably a response to France's recognition of Franco. Judging from the above facts, the bankruptcy of Daladier's policy is very clear. All hopes of splitting the Berlin-Rome axis have vanished like smoke. The German semi-official magazine "Voelkischer Beobachter" stated: "Germany and Italy must work together to deal with both east and west."</p>
<p>From Munich to the recognition of Franco, Daladier has pursued a policy of step-by-step concessions to the aggressors, and France's position has become increasingly precarious. Why does Daladier consistently follow Chamberlain, adopting such a policy of appeasement that endangers its own interests? Regarding this, the famous French journalist Madame Tabouis recently gave a very insightful answer: "There is nothing else to it. The reason why Daladier maintains the policy of concession is purely because class interests are at play. There are three most prominent classes in France: the aristocracy, the financial community, and the laboring masses. The first two classes are currently in power, believing that war is not conducive to their class interests, and are therefore willing to sacrifice national interests for the sake of class interests."</p>
<p>However, France is now in an extremely precarious position, and the fists of the fascists will inevitably damage the interests of the French financial stratum. Tao Ermo said: "The war crisis is now greater than ever before. After the Italian government repeatedly concentrated troops in northern Libya, even the Swiss Confederation has taken all necessary measures to deal with the Italian threat if necessary. France, of course, cannot afford to delay any longer." Yes, to safeguard France's security, Daladier must quickly wake up in time and adopt a firm and strong countermeasure against the aggressors. At the same time, we hope that the French Socialist Party, which is currently gathering to discuss national affairs, can recognize the current crisis and urge the government to change its policy of appeasement in order to protect the motherland!</p>
<h3>British Government Decides to Provide Further Financial Assistance to China; Amount Estimated Between Three and Five Million Pounds; and to Join the United States in Economic Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph diplomatic correspondent stated that the Spanish war situation will soon end, and the British government has shifted its focus in the past week to bringing the Sino-Japanese War to an early conclusion. This can be seen from the news that Britain will provide loans to assist China's currency. It is heard that this loan will be between three million and five million pounds, and it is expected that this money will be enough to consolidate China's currency system and resist Japanese destructive methods. In the current environment, due to careful economical use of currency reserves, China's difficulty in obtaining military supplies has greatly increased. Before the new loan is established, Britain will almost certainly pass a special bill, but the government's necessary actions can be implemented. This measure will be seen after the final passage of the Export Credit Act last week, from which China will also benefit, and can purchase a large number of heavy trucks and other supplies from Britain. In the past few weeks, the British and American governments have also considered direct methods of exerting pressure on Japan in strict economic terms, which would greatly hinder Japan from obtaining the supplies necessary for large-scale war. This is certainly within the power of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. The previously planned amount of twenty million pounds by Britain has now been used for other purposes. In short, Britain now intends to unite with other friendly countries to compel the aggressor countries to maintain peace and use its great financial power to achieve this goal. Restricting the Japanese goods market is also not difficult, but this matter requires the consent of all parts of the British Empire, which will take a longer time to implement. London experts have recently reviewed all aspects of this issue to provide the government with the necessary information to serve as a basis for government decisions. Regarding the loan to China, the cabinet considered it last July, but it was not passed at the time, because this measure did not have sufficient justification and there were fears that Japan would consider it an unfriendly act as the European crisis progressed. The correspondent also stated that the loan to China previously proposed last year was in the amount of twenty million pounds. Now, after the United States lent China US$25 million in debt in December last year, the British government is preparing to adopt an active plan in the Far East, which shows that the British government has a greater spirit of trust to cope with the war issues that are still disrupting the world. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the British government is indeed drafting detailed rules to provide financial assistance to China. However, all parties acknowledge that various necessary arrangements and negotiations will take some time. Officials in this environment are unwilling to disclose progress information. All actions by the British government will be consistent with the already announced intention to maintain interests in China. As for the rumors about how much will be loaned to assist China's currency system, they are purely speculative. However, it is believed that negotiations are now nearing completion and an announcement can be made within a few days. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The relevant authorities recently declared that the British government has decided to grant a commercial loan of three million pounds to China, in order to build another railway line from Kunming to Myanmar, in addition to the recently completed Yunnan-Burma Highway. The necessary rails to be purchased should be fully allocated within this loan. The purchase price of some locomotives and vehicles should also be taken from this. The remainder, it is heard, will be sold by the United States. People in China say that the Yunnan-Burma Railway is over 500 kilometers long and cannot be fully funded with three million pounds, and continued negotiations on credit loans are needed to be of any use. At a time when Japan's attempts to blockade maritime communications are becoming increasingly active, this route is of course even more important. Financial circles in London also say that the British government, because the US government will lend China US$25 million, is now taking a further step to assist China on a larger scale than before. From now on, although China will have to spend huge amounts of military expenditure, it will naturally be easier to stabilize its currency. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Reverend Seebart Claims China Will Win: Resistance Can Continue for at Least Three More Years; Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, Comparable to English Star Victoria</h3>
<p>(London) American Reverend Seebart praised the glorious national salvation work of Chinese women, saying, "Today, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, is to China as Queen Victoria was to England in the past." Reverend Seebart is currently staying in London for a short time and plans to depart for New York and then return to China. According to his expressed beliefs, the Sino-Japanese war will continue for at least three years, and China will not fail in the end. The biggest mistake Japan has made since the start of the war is failing to consider the new spirit of the Chinese nation. China's greatest need today is for medicine, and in the next three years, this need will become even greater. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Flees, Coup Occurs in Spain: Leftists Form National Defense Council; Striving for a Glorious Peace with All Efforts</h3>
<p>Madrid: After Colonel Casado overthrew the Negrín government, the situation in Madrid was still calm. The National Defense Council has been organized and completed without encountering resistance. Casado also made peace overtures, speaking to Spaniards in the areas occupied by the Nationalists, saying that all that compatriots in the territory of the Republican government seek is peace, independence, and freedom. We do not fight for what we do not need. We want the country to be free from all foreign forces. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid: The newly formed National Defense Council has been endorsed by General Miaja, former commander-in-chief of the Spanish Republican Army, Navy, and Air Force. Prime Minister Negrín and several other cabinet members, after fleeing Madrid, arrived in the Levant region this morning. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid: The city's radio station has just broadcast news that the Negrín cabinet has resigned to interim President Barrio. The situation in the capital is extremely peaceful. (6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid: After the organization and establishment of the National Defense Council, commentators have recently explained that the National Defense Council is supported by anarchist factions and various left-wing groups other than the Communist Party. These groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the Negrín cabinet for more than a day. After the catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Catalonia, their opposition sentiment also increased. Former Prime Minister Negrín, after returning from Catalonia to this place, actually issued a large number of orders, giving important military positions to communists, seemingly claiming to be a dictator. Thus, the feeling of injustice became even more unbearable, leading to this coup and the announcement of the establishment of the National Defense Council. It immediately elected the militia representative, General Casado, commander-in-chief of the Central Army, as interim chairman. This man has a high reputation in military circles and among labor unions and will be able to unify military and political affairs. The mission of the National Defense Council is to maintain order and curb future offensives by the Nationalist forces within the entire territory of the Republican government until it obtains a "glorious peace." (6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After Colonel Mera, a key figure in the National Confederation of Labor of the Spanish anarchist faction, delivered a radio speech, British diplomatic figures recently commented that a detailed analysis of the main points of the speech is actually a call that combines the meanings of peace and compromise. If the situation in the two countries is expected, they should take this opportunity to conduct negotiations in order to end their civil war. At this time, if General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, can base his actions on Colonel Mera's suggestion and issue a general amnesty, his prestige will not be diminished, and the civil war can be ended. This is a wise move. However, Britain's previous attempts at mediation have already failed, and it currently intends not to interfere in the matter for the time being, and will try to do so again when necessary. After the establishment of the National Defense Council in Madrid, although the British authorities have not contacted it, they have allowed the consul stationed in the port of Valencia, Madrid, to act as he sees fit and to engage in mediation as soon as peace negotiations can be conducted.

<p>(Paris) According to a French report today, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, intends to give the government forces a final opportunity to surrender before launching a fierce attack on Madrid.

However, it is said that Franco still very much hopes to avoid continued bloodshed within the scope of what is possible. (5th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Defense Council Announces Policy of Resistance: Hopes to Ensure Spanish Independence; Condemns Former Prime Minister for Ruining the Country and Harming the People</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Republican government has already formed a National Defense Council, composed of General Casado, the militia representative, Pasterlo, a key figure of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party, San Andres, a key figure of the Republican Party, and two other members. General Casado then delivered a radio speech, stating that the government has decided to continue the war of resistance until it obtains a glorious peace. "The Spanish nation is now fighting for independence, and would rather die than surrender. Long live Spain, long live the Republican government. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid: After Pasterlo, a key figure of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party here, General Casado, commander of the Central Army, and others formed the National Defense Council and exercised the powers of the Negrín cabinet of the Republican government, Pasterlo issued a radio speech in the name of the Council yesterday at midnight, stating that in the Battle of Salon, the entire state of Catalonia fell, and the authorities of the Republican government fled to France, hesitating for many days. When they decided to return to their motherland, they had already lost their credibility in law and morality and were not qualified to meet the current difficulties. All of this is evident. Moreover, the various authorities abandoned their posts and fled first, and President Acha also resigned later. Furthermore, the Negrín cabinet was not only not endorsed by President Acha, but was also condemned by the people of the whole country. Therefore, the Republican government had no authority to speak of. It actually continued to obey foreign orders with little knowledge of shame, disregarding the honor of the Spanish Republic. At this critical juncture, we were forced to come forward and establish a legitimate regime, and we have also established a military and political power, calling on the people of the whole country to support it. Another member of the National Defense Council, General Casado, then delivered a speech, saying, "Spanish compatriots, I am now speaking to you with a sad mood. We have all suffered a lot. As for myself, I have never intended to command the people, but only to serve the people. I now frankly declare that I am willing to do my best for the independence and freedom of the nation. I know that the current problem is that we are not fighting for foreign countries. We want to free our motherland from the shackles of imperialists. Our policy is to defend the territorial integrity of Spain until we have peace and freedom. In short, we now have two ways, which we must choose. One is to regain freedom and make the country strong, and the other is to kill each other for foreign countries, only to make the country bankrupt. That's all. In short, we must rekindle the spirit of patriotism. What our country is concerned about is the welfare of Spain, and nothing else. If we do not obtain a glorious peace, we will die on the battlefield." According to reports, the National Defense Council is composed of six members, including General Casado, commander of the Central Army, Pasterlo, former Speaker of the House of Representatives of the moderate faction of the Socialist Party, Carillo of the Socialist General Labor Union, San Andres of the Republican Left, and Jold and Maran of the Anarchist National Confederation of Labor, all of whom are key figures of their respective parties. (6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid: Colonel Mera, a key figure in the National Confederation of Labor of the anarchist faction, recently delivered a radio speech, stating that "a part of the territory of the motherland has now been lost. The cause of this is that the rebellious behavior is the root cause. Former Prime Minister Negrín only knew how to plunder wealth and escape in times of difficulty, causing the people to be poisoned by the enemy and shaming the soldiers on the front line and the workers in the rear. This is the worst of sins." Fortunately, from this day on, Spain has a government and a definite mission, that is, to seek a glorious peace based on justice and friendship. If our call is unfortunately not understood and adopted, we will fight to the end to maintain the independence of our country." (6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Garrison Mutinies in Cartagena Harbor: Many Warships Also Depart</h3>

<h3>Germany Urgently Demands Redistribution of World Resources to Overcome Financial and Economic Difficulties - Speech by Minister of Propaganda Goebbels -</h3>
<p>Leipzig. The city market in this city has opened today. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels attended and delivered a speech, discussing Germany's economic and financial situation. While acknowledging that Germany's economy and finances still had many shortcomings, he strongly asserted that this was not Germany's fault. His conclusion was that Germany would not welcome any international measures intended to oppose normal trade. "Germany has a population of 80 million. If its economic foundation is too narrow, leading to an inability to live and work, self-determination cannot be considered satisfactory. This point should be recognized by all countries in the world." The full text of Goebbels' speech is translated below:</p>
<p>Goebbels first stated that before the National Socialist Party came to power in 1933, Germany's economic situation was deteriorating daily. The reason for this was the erroneous principles adopted by the authorities at the time. They believed that a country could easily rectify its economic situation even without the necessary power, which was a major mistake. "It must be understood that the economic foundation that Germany maintains cannot provide the necessary food to supply the entire nation. This shortage is not due to our lack of intelligence or effort. It is because Germany has not obtained its fair share of resources in the global distribution of wealth." In short, Germany is a country with insufficient resources and has no choice but to take various measures to "remedy" this. However, these measures are often not understood by the general public and often cause resentment. At the same time, democratic countries, especially England, ridicule these measures from the sidelines. They should know that these democratic countries all possess large amounts of wealth, raw materials, and colonies, while Germany does not. However, these countries are certainly not superior to Germany in terms of intelligence or in the methods of developing these resources. "As for Germany, it is not without its faults. For example, the current situation is due to the mistakes of past authorities, starting with launching wars, followed by signing the Treaty of Versailles, and then successively accepting the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. These repeated mistakes have plunged the nation into a deep abyss. It was not until the National Socialist Party came to power that it carried out its mission with the most glorious political enthusiasm, the greatest effort, and the strongest awareness. Therefore, the National Socialist government not only cannot be held responsible for the current situation but can also be proud of the economic achievements of the past six years. However, we cannot help but say that the unequal distribution of wealth among the nations of the world today is undeniable, and Germany still has no colonies to obtain raw materials, and Germany's existing space is insufficient to guarantee the nation's survival. At the same time, foreign countries are constantly trying to cut off Germany's markets. It must be understood that Germany demands survival and even has a right to survival."</p>
<p>Although Germany faces economic difficulties as described above, thanks to the efforts of the entire country, its manufactured industrial products have exceeded its domestic needs. It will inevitably use the surplus industrial products to exchange for all or part of the raw materials and finished products that we lack. However, there is a major principle that must be adhered to, that is, due to financial constraints, the amount of goods we purchase from foreign countries must not be higher than the amount of our goods exported. Under this principle, Germany is prepared to abandon all political prejudices to solve this problem. Some say that Germany is promoting economic autarky, but this is just a rumor. In essence, Germany only adopts economic self-sufficiency measures as a last resort within the scope of meeting national needs. Even the government's implementation of the Four-Year Economic Plan is only aimed at making the German economy free from the constraints of foreign raw materials. Germany has invented various raw material "substitutes" for this reason.</p>
<p>Goebbels then mentioned the issue of labor, stating that the most urgent problem at present is the shortage of labor. The current economic system must be intensified to make it more rational. What is gratifying is that the German nation has unparalleled perseverance. The major economic difficulties currently encountered are purely due to geographical and spatial shortcomings. The plan personally formulated by Führer Hitler is a good guarantee for overcoming these difficulties. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Defense of Guam to Be Temporarily Shelved</h3>
<p>(Washington) A bill proposed by Congressman Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, to add naval aviation bases in the Alaskan Peninsula, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Pacific at a cost of $52,000,000, included a clause for the construction of an airfield in Guam. Although the House of Representatives decided to abolish this clause on the 23rd of last month, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, after reviewing the results, still included this clause in the original bill and submitted it to the Senate for discussion today. Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, immediately expressed his opposition, stating that the plan to build an airfield in Guam might be seen as a threat to Japan and should not be implemented at present. Political observers have commented that since this plan has aroused controversy, the government originally intended to abandon it in order to quell the situation. Now that Walsh has issued the above statement, it has been decided to abolish it. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>

<p>Bombay. Since Gandhi declared that he would fast to death if the Rajkot authorities did not accept the recommendations of the Reform Committee, this declaration has caused extreme tension throughout India. Yesterday, clashes occurred between Indian natives and British troops in the town of Benares, resulting in the deaths of 30 Indians. As a result, protests and demonstrations in various towns are endless. Various parties have telegraphed the Governor-General, urging him to intervene in this matter. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Romanian-Polish Talks Reach Consensus - Polish Foreign Minister to Visit England</h3>
<p>Warsaw. After talks between Romanian Foreign Minister Chafenco and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, an official announcement was issued here stating, "The two sides have reached complete consensus. In the future, for various political and economic issues that have a common relationship between the two countries, they should act in unison." (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Warsaw. Before returning to his country, Romanian Foreign Minister Chafenco gave a speech here, stating that his talks with Foreign Minister Beck were candid and harmonious, and have achieved satisfactory results. "Our government's peaceful policies are fully understood by the Polish authorities, and are completely in line with the spirit of understanding expressed by the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Entente. A spirit of candor and friendship is growing and developing in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Its intention is by no means to hinder any other country from increasing its friendship with its neighbors, which is clearly evident." Foreign Minister Beck and I discussed the general situation of international affairs, especially issues related to both parties, such as the Ukrainian issue, which must be handled by considering the future trends of the situation. As for the relationship between Romania and Hungary, efforts are currently being made to establish understanding between the two sides. However, our country will treat all ethnic minorities within its borders with justice and fairness, so that they can live and work in peace and have close relationships with the countries in which they reside. Regarding the Jewish issue, Foreign Minister Beck and I both believe that this matter should be handled within the international scope. Regarding the issue of colonies, Romania has never made any demands. In addition, the governments of Poland and Romania have decided to develop transportation between the two countries. The main route is to build bridges over the Danube River to extend the railway from Warsaw to the capital of Romania to the capital of Bulgaria, Thessaloniki in Greece, and to open canals between the Dniester River and the Prut River, thereby connecting the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Cooperation with Japan - Does Not Harm Authority - British Newspaper Discusses Several Points in the Agreement - Will Inevitably Cause Much Anxiety - British Undersecretary Declares in House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Undersecretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities have agreed on a workable method of cooperation. Foreign Secretary Halifax believes that this method does not harm the authority of the Municipal Council. A member of parliament asked whether the British government would continue to fully support future negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. Butler replied that it would. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council was correct in rejecting the more severe demands made by the Japanese side. Its stated reason for accepting the request for more Japanese police is that if terrorist acts can be eliminated, it will benefit both parties. Several points in the agreement will inevitably cause much anxiety. The most serious of these is the requirement that Chinese criminals and suspects be interrogated by Japanese police and gendarmes according to regulations. Anyone who knows the methods of torture used by the Japanese in their own country knows that this requirement has a sinister meaning. In practice, it will subject the Chinese living in the Public Concession to the same terror as those outside the Concession. Has a democratic country once again made a concession to the force of arms at the expense of the weak? (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Severe Food Shortage in Peiping</h3>
<p>(Peiping) According to Chinese sources, the "Provisional Government" may purchase grain from Jin Province in the near future to alleviate the food shortage in Peiping. The reason for this decision by the "Provisional Government" is that it cannot purchase sorghum and grains from "Manchukuo" as expected. The "Manchukuo" government restricted the cultivation of sorghum and grain crops last year for military reasons. The "Provisional Government" recently ordered a large batch of rice from Rangoon and Saigon, which will soon arrive in Tianjin. The imported rice will pass through Tianjin Customs duty-free and then be transported to Peiping as quickly as possible. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to Chinese sources, China Airlines will launch round-trip air service between Peiping and Dalian starting from March 1st.

<h3>French Socialist Party Criticizes Foreign Policy - Former Interior Minister Delivers Speech - Says It Will Breed Trouble</h3>
<p>(Paris) The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held a meeting last night. Party leader Blum was unable to attend in person due to a severe cold. Most of the committee members who spoke advocated convening an international peace conference to promote world peace. Taulmer, a key member of the party and former Minister of the Interior, strongly criticized Foreign Minister Bonnet's foreign policy, stating that domestic and foreign affairs are interconnected. "Foreign Minister Bonnet's foreign policy is no different from Prime Minister Daladier and Finance Minister Reynaud's domestic policies. Domestically, only Fascism is respected, and externally, it will inevitably lead to Fascism." The crisis of war is greater today than ever before. The Italian government has repeatedly concentrated troops in Libya, North Africa. Neutral countries such as the Swiss Confederation have also taken the necessary measures to deal with the threat from Italy when necessary. How can France continue to procrastinate? But in reality, "the government has already humiliated itself on the side of General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army of Spain, and now it must allow Germany and Italy to engage in blackmail, or say that it can at least maintain neutrality in the event of war in the future. This is childish talk. In short, the policy pursued by Foreign Minister Bonnet is a policy of humiliation, which on the one hand weakens France's position, and on the other hand can still lead France to war, with the result that France will only face the future war under more unfavorable conditions." Recently, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania have shown signs of striving to invigorate and resolve to resist. England and the Soviet Union are also preparing to approach each other. "From this, it can be seen that everything can still be saved. I don't know why the government authorities are pursuing a policy of appeasement... International problems must be resolved within the international scope and can never be resolved by two-party or three-party meetings. The situation is so serious that we must be careful and not disappoint the countries of Central and Eastern Europe." As for domestic affairs, it has become a question whether French socialists can freely govern the country without obtaining the consent of German Führer Hitler. Hitler once said that if a communist government were established in Paris, Germany would not tolerate it. Although I personally also oppose the Communist Party coming to power, "this has nothing to do with Hitler and does not require him to overstep his bounds." Socialist Congressman Grumbarsh then spoke, also advocating convening an international conference and demanding that guarantees be obtained in advance, with the participating countries mutually agreeing not to use force to resolve disputes. Former Minister of Economy Spinasse said that after German Führer Hitler delivered a speech in the House of Representatives on January 30th of this year, the proposal to convene an international conference was more powerful. Germany and Italy both lack raw materials, and by convening a conference, they can be induced to return to the world economic system. Now is the time. If all the countries concerned can work together to organize peace and reduce armaments, the current state of the mandated territories may not be without the possibility of being revised. I now propose that the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party pass a motion unconditionally demanding the convening of an international conference. At this point, former Finance Minister Voriol held a dissenting opinion, saying that it is difficult to say whether this meeting can achieve anything. British Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that it is not yet time to convene an international conference. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Socialist Party has split into two factions regarding foreign policy, one advocating toughness and the other advocating compromise. There was a dispute when the party held its annual congress in December of last year. As a result, the hard-line faction prevailed. Now, the National Executive Committee of the party held another meeting here the night before, and the two factions each presented their views and then submitted motions to the National Executive Committee separately. The hard-line faction is represented by former Finance Minister Voriol and former Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Quentin, and the motion they proposed advocates adopting a policy of resistance towards all omnipotent countries. The compromise faction is represented by the party's Secretary-General Fuer and former Minister of National Economy Spinasse, and their motion advocates maintaining direct contact with all omnipotent countries. The hard-line faction has always had the support of party leader Blum. This time, Blum was unable to attend in person due to illness, and the faction's position was inevitably affected. However, it is difficult to predict the results of the voting. The main points of the motion proposed by Voriol and Quentin are outlined below. The motion first states that France has been threatened since Italy interfered in the Spanish Civil War, and accuses Foreign Minister Bonnet of pursuing a policy that has left behind hidden dangers. After the Japanese Empire adopted violent actions, the position of England and France in the Far East has also been threatened. "French socialists firmly believe that France should not continue to be passive and wait for the arrival of new crises. It must immediately launch an active and courageous policy in diplomacy so that Germany and Italy can understand that France will never tolerate those countries occupying Spain." In addition, France must adhere to all existing international commitments, especially the various commitments stipulated by the Anglo-French Entente and the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. U.S. President Roosevelt's repeated declarations of sympathy for all democratic countries should be the compass for French diplomacy. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Turnaround in Palestine Problem</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the Palestine problem, representatives of the British government and the Arab delegation held a meeting this morning, and the Jewish delegation also held a meeting at the same time. Some people here believe that a compromise solution may be reached between the Arab and Jewish peoples, so the Palestine problem conference may have some success and not be a complete failure.

<p>Cairo. Osman, Undersecretary of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance, took a special plane to the capital of Syria at the end of last week to meet with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to discuss British proposals and is expected to return here today. Before leaving, he told a special correspondent from a Beirut newspaper here that the Archbishop said that in order to obtain the independence of Palestine, he would abandon all personal grudges. Political figures here are optimistic about this statement and widely believe that the Archbishop has submitted a counter-proposal to Osman, which the Egyptian government will forward to the United Kingdom, including a request to declare an independent Arab country and allow limited Jewish immigration and allow Jews to purchase a quarter of the land in Palestine.

<h3>Grain Supply Insufficient in Guangdong Province: Ministry of Finance Approves Import of Foreign Rice; Rice Prices Soar in Guangzhou; Scarcity Also Felt in Xijiang and Beijiang</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the fall of Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, apart from the counties in the war zone ravaged by the Japanese army, many counties near the war zone have been affected by war. Farmers have migrated and been displaced, and most of the good rice fields have been abandoned. Therefore, since the autumn harvest last year, the amount of rice and grain in the inland areas has been decreasing day by day. Those with foresight have predicted that a rice shortage is inevitable during the lean months of spring. The surviving refugees, not dying in battle, will become starved corpses. This is indeed a serious problem. In peacetime, the rice and grain in Guangdong Province were already insufficient for self-sufficiency, and they relied on supplies of rice from Siam and Annam. Since the Guangzhou port was blockaded by the Japanese army, the waterway between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been obstructed for four months. When the Japanese army entered Guangzhou in October last year, it was precisely the time when the late rice crops in Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, and other counties were abundant. Initially, because the Japanese army had not yet invaded the villages, the villagers in each county took the opportunity to harvest the ripened red rice. However, in some counties, the late rice had not yet reached the stage of full maturity, and farmers were still adopting a wait-and-see attitude. When Japanese cavalry arrived in the suburbs of Guangzhou (such as Shipai Township, Kangdong Township, etc.), and mules and horses lacked feed, the Japanese army grooms arbitrarily cut down the rice crops in the villages to feed the mules and horses. The farmers' half-year of hard work was watched helplessly as others used it to feed livestock, and they were filled with resentment. Once the news spread that the Japanese army was cutting rice to feed horses, farmers in other counties quickly harvested the unripe rice crops, even though three or four tenths of the rice ears had not yet formed grains. However, they did not care, as it was better to have a poor harvest than to have the Japanese army steal the crops.</p>
<p>Winter Harvest Suffers: Last winter, farmers suffered unexpected poor harvests of rice crops, whether landlords or tenants suffered great losses, which indirectly affected the food supply of the entire province. In areas that usually produce rice (such as Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Conghua, etc.), at the end of last year, because the old rice had not yet been exhausted, each yuan (Guangdong currency) could buy about six to seven catties of rice. When the Japanese army expanded the scope of its invasion, east to Zengcheng and Conghua, west to Sanshui, and north to Panyu and Huaxian, they took whatever they wanted. Pingzhou Township, which belongs to Nanhai, was originally a place where rice production was most abundant. When the Japanese army first arrived, they first looted white rice from the township, taking hundreds of bags at a time. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, white rice in the area could be bought for eight to nine catties per yuan. After the Japanese army looted it, the price of rice immediately rose, and the poor people gnashed their teeth.</p>
<p>Stored Rice Seized: Since the fall of the Guangzhou city area, all the rice shops in the city have been looted. The Japanese army used spies to find out that there were white rice warehouses in the two places of Xicun and Huadi in the suburbs, and then used military vehicles to transport the stored rice away. The China Rice Industry Company had hundreds of thousands of dan of stored rice, and the Chinese army did not have time to move it, so it was also completely plundered by the Japanese army as military rations. At the same time, because there was a shortage of food in the market, the Japanese army used a soft policy to resell the stored rice stolen from the local area to the citizens, stipulating that only Japanese military tickets could be used for transactions. They not only gave away other people's property generously, but also forced the citizens to exchange and use military tickets. Their plan was truly cunning. However, because of their harshness, most citizens did not trade with them. Therefore, small vendors in the city did not hesitate to travel long distances to transport local rice from Pingzhou and other places back to the city for retail, but the cost was too high, and only four to five catties could be sold for each yuan. With rice as expensive as pearls, the lives of the people left in the city became even more difficult.</p>
<p>Import of Foreign Rice: The war in Guangdong Province has been prolonged, and it has been four months since then. Each county lacks reserves, and the signs of famine are now visible this spring. The price of white rice is also twice as expensive as at the end of last year. The poor people in the war zone all have a hungry look on their faces. Even in counties that are not in the war zone, there is a severe rice shortage due to the lean months of spring. The Guangdong military and political authorities believe that the matter is serious and are eager to find ways to deal with it as soon as possible. They have specially submitted a report to the Central Ministry of Finance, requesting that one million dan of foreign rice be temporarily allowed to be imported tax-free from March 1. This measure has already been approved. Recently, the authorities, considering that various places in the northwest and the two rivers are also feeling a shortage of rice and grain, have specially submitted another request to the Ministry of Finance, asking that foreign rice transported to Guangdong be temporarily allowed to be imported tax-free without restriction. Otherwise, at the very least, allow five million dan of tax-free foreign rice to be imported to relieve the current famine in various places and help the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Jinhua, the Anti-Japanese War Center in Eastern Zhejiang, is Making Great Strides (4): Flourishing Education and Culture; Building Warehouses to Store Food; Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang highway trunk line is 62.30 kilometers long, with the Yongkang-Jinhua section accounting for two-thirds. The reporter took a bus from Yongkang Bus Station, with only nine passengers. It is said that although there are few travelers coming and going these days, the buses can still run on time, which is indeed the spirit of the transportation industry. In recent years, with the active construction of highway trunk lines, branch lines, and county roads in eastern Zhejiang by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the planned routes have been completed, and they are quickly connected to important strongholds of various highways in Jiangxi. At that time, most of the construction was requisitioned from the people. Those who had the strength responded themselves, and those who did not have the strength hired workers to replace them. Today, the highways of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces make a great contribution to the military. Because the highway is flat, even though the car is traveling at a very high speed, the seat does not feel bumpy. On both sides of the highway are towering mountain peaks, and the car seems to be traveling between giant rocks. There are many villages along the way, and the car stops for a few minutes at each small station. When the car is about to arrive at Jinhua Station, there are many mud houses under construction on the side of the road. According to people in the same car, due to the recent increase in population, these simple mud and grass houses are being built everywhere to solve the problem of housing.</p>
<p>Transportation Hub</p>
<p>Today, Jinhua is not only the center of military activities in eastern Zhejiang, but also the transportation hub of the interior. In addition to the Hangzhou-Yushan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is centered on Jinhua, there are also the Jinhua-Wuyi Highway and the Jinhua-Lanxi Highway, which both start from Jinhua. The Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway starts from the Shangqiao Bridge across the river in the south of the city, passes through Zhuzhen under the ridge into Wuyi territory, and reaches Yongkang. This road is the only important road connecting Wenzhou on the coast of Zhejiang, and its situation is important. Now, those going to the interior all pass through this road. The Jinhua-Lanxi Highway reaches Lanxi County to the west. It starts from the Jingu Pavilion area of the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Highway and branches into Lanxi territory. This highway is parallel to the Lanxi branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, so there are no scheduled buses running now. But once necessary, its importance is no less than that of the Jinhua-Wuyi-Yongkang Road. The Beishan Highway was built by the county government to facilitate tourists traveling to Beishan in Jinhua. Now, after active preparations, the joint transportation between Zhejiang and Guilin on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened, and Jinhua Station is the starting point. Therefore, today Jinhua is in a more important position in the interior transportation.</p>
<p>Abundant Products</p>
<p>The products of Jinhua County are mainly agricultural products, and the specialty products are also agricultural by-products. The total annual output of the county is 1,630,000 dan. In terms of ordinary agricultural products, the annual output is 80,000 dan of wheat, 70,000 dan of barley, 360,000 dan of miscellaneous grains, and other products such as soybeans and glutinous rice. The total annual output of ordinary agricultural specialty products is more than 1.8 million units. Therefore, although Jinhua is a large city with a concentrated population, it is self-sufficient in terms of people's food. In the urban area of Jinhua, there is a state of prosperity everywhere. The streets, hotels, and restaurants are all crowded with people. Jinhua is the most developed area in eastern Zhejiang for cultural undertakings. In terms of primary education, there are more than 180 private primary schools and 24 county-run primary schools. In terms of secondary education, there are Jinhua Middle School, a provincial school, with more than 900 male and female students and more than 70 teachers. There is the Jinhua Experimental Agricultural School, a provincial school, with more than 100 students. Jinhua County Junior High School has 384 students. There are also private junior high schools such as Zuoxin Junior High School with more than 220 students and Chengmei Girls' Junior High School with 60 students. In Jinhua, which has a large number of intellectuals, it is conceivable that their anti-Japanese sentiments are fierce and their efforts in the work of saving the nation are great. In Jinhua, not only local students have organized national salvation groups, but also many national salvation groups, singing teams, and national salvation drama troupes from Shanghai and Hangzhou have also formed a united front, awakening the entire Jinhua and the people of neighboring counties.</p>
<p>Popular Sentiments Are Warm</p>
<p>There are several wounded soldier hospitals in the urban area of Jinhua, with good facilities. Many of the nursing work is undertaken by local young women. In the anti-Japanese theater in the urban area of Jinhua, there are often performances and speeches promoting national salvation. In addition to dramas, the most popular are songs. The people of Jinhua are proud to be able to sing a few national salvation songs, such as "Strong Men Go Forward" and "Protect Our Homeland". Not only does each school in Jinhua have a national salvation singing team or drama troupe, but other organizations such as the County Women's Federation and the County Party Headquarters also have organizations, totaling no less than twenty or thirty. Therefore, today the atmosphere of national salvation propaganda is particularly strong in the entire county of Jinhua. They not only work in their own county, but also promote in various places in eastern Zhejiang. Undoubtedly, Jinhua is a center of activity in eastern Zhejiang. The most prosperous section in the city, from West Market Street to Lotus Well, is also a new atmosphere. There are more than 60,000 strong men in the entire county. All those of strong men age, regardless of class, must be organized into training groups, and the results are excellent. Every morning and evening, there are groups of trained strong men in the suburbs, practicing under the leadership of instructors. The reporter saw that each team of trained strong men was neatly dressed and moved quickly. It is worth mentioning the construction of local warehouses. The Jinhua County Government, in view of the importance of grain storage during wartime and in order to adjust the price of grain, has recently built a grain storage warehouse and two agricultural warehouses in addition to the existing warehouses, which can usually hold more than 9,000 dan of grain. There is also a new-style warehouse with an area of 7.3 mu, which can also be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Area of Scenic Beauty</p>
<p>Jinhua has Beishan, whose veins come from Dabanshan Mountain in Dongyang County, winding and undulating for more than 40 kilometers. Famous monks and Taoists of past dynasties have lived in seclusion and studied here. Therefore, the ancient monuments and scenic spots of Jinhua Mountain are scattered all over the place. The Zhejiang Provincial Government used this to develop it into a scenic area, and the Beishan Highway was built for this purpose. The reporter, attracted by its scenic spots, left the West Gate of Jinhua and took the Beishan Highway on foot. After 15 li, he arrived at Luodian, and then detoured along the mountain path for 10 li to reach Shuanglong Cave and Binghu Cave. Because the weather was severely cold, he could not enter the cave. He only hired someone from Shuanglong Tea Shop to guide him around the nearby area for a week. The crystal curtain of the Binghu Cave was not seen, which was a pity.</p>
<h3>Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory Forced to Shut Down</h3>
<p>German Merchants are Negotiating with the Japanese Side, Nantong Correspondence: Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Textile Company and Haimen Dasheng No. 3 Textile Company are the largest enterprises in Jiangbei. They were originally initiated by Mr. Zhang Jian and were the earliest yarn factories operated by the Chinese. In recent years, due to the expansion of business and the purchase of machinery, they owed a large amount of money to the German merchant Aegis Yanghang, so they were changed to be managed by the Yanghang's manager. Since the fall of Tonghai last year, they have continued to resume work under the management of the German merchant. However, the Japanese have long hoped to cooperate, and rumors have once occurred in the outside world because of this. In fact, the company has always operated independently and has not had any relationship with them. However, because the Japanese side delayed for a long time, they took decisive measures. On March 2, the local military and secret service agency director Hama Moto Zong Saburo issued a public notice, dispatched Chang to the factory to seal the factory buildings, and ordered the shutdown. The company had no choice but to temporarily stop work in order to value the factory's rights. After receiving the report from the German staff stationed at the factory, Aegis Yanghang, because the manager's rights and interests were involved, heard that they had begun negotiations with the Japanese side through diplomatic channels. As for the yarn and cloth that has already been manufactured, most of it has been transported to Shanghai and is still selling well in various places.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces: Losses of Higher Education and Cultural Institutions; Irreparable Losses to Higher Education Nationwide; University Losses Most Severe in Libraries; Unprecedented Losses of Private Book Collections; More Than 2,900 Boxes of Antiquities Lost</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the July 7th Incident, Chinese higher education and cultural institutions have suffered the greatest damage. According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Education, as of the end of December 27, the equipment, books, and instruments of various universities have been burned, plundered, or bombed, resulting in the loss of most of them. Before the war, there were a total of 108 universities and colleges in the country. In the past 18 months, 14 schools have suffered extremely great damage, 18 schools have been unable to continue operating, and 73 schools have been relocated and are barely able to hold classes, unable to utilize their original equipment. In terms of property estimates, the losses of national schools have reached more than 36.5 million yuan, provincial universities more than 6.1 million yuan, and private universities more than 22.6 million yuan. Among the national schools, Peking University, the earliest university founded in China, has suffered complete losses, and it is almost impossible to calculate. Secondly, Tsinghua University, although some books and instruments have been carried out, has also lost as much as 6.05 million yuan. Among the private schools, the losses of books and instruments at Lingnan University have reached more than 3.8 million yuan, and Nankai University has reached more than 3.75 million yuan. These are the property losses that can still be estimated numerically. As for those whose value cannot be estimated in money, there are the materials collected by Tsinghua University on the history of modern China, the archives of Peking University on the Ming and Qing dynasties, the rubbings of gold and stone collected by famous collectors, and the data collected by the China Land Research Institute over the years, all of which cannot be restored. The academic losses are even more significant.</p>
<p>Among the losses of various universities, libraries suffered the most. In terms of national schools, 1,119,417 volumes were lost. Provincial schools lost 104,950 volumes. Private schools lost 1,533,980 volumes, totaling 2,830,386 volumes. However, this is only based on the statistics of 40 schools in the occupied areas. The number is already so large. The schools in the war zone also suffered great losses because they were relocated too late and could not be transported out. For example, 800 boxes of books and instruments from National Shandong University, including 76,724 volumes of books, were all lost at Pukou Railway Station. The total number of losses of various schools can be seen to be enormous.</p>
<p>As for cultural institutions, the losses are also heavy. There are more than 2,500 libraries in the occupied areas and war zones. The minimum loss is estimated at 5,000 volumes per library, so the total loss is at least more than 10 million volumes. But in fact, the exquisite large libraries in important coastal cities have fallen into enemy hands. For example, the National Central Library of Nanjing and the Jiangsu Provincial Library, the National Peiping Library of Peiping, the National Peking University Library, and the Tsinghua University Library, all of which are rich in collections and many of which are fine editions and famous manuscripts, have been destroyed and plundered, which is especially regrettable. What is even more regrettable is that private book collections have also been almost completely destroyed this time. For example, the collections of the Wu family and the Jiayetang Liu family, the Changshu Tieqin Tongjianlou Qu family, and the Suzhou Pangxizhai Pan family are the best in the country and even surpass those of public libraries. All of them have been forcibly plundered by the Japanese. Not only books, but also the wooden printing blocks used to carve books in the past have also been plundered. The National Central Library lost more than 70,000 pieces, the Zhejiang Provincial Library lost more than 100,000 pieces, and all those in Guangdong and Hubei were also completely lost. Nearly seven or eight tenths of the wooden blocks collected in the country have been lost. It will be difficult to obtain woodcut fine editions in the future. China has only established modern public libraries for 30 years. This time, it has suffered a sudden blow. Not only has the essence been lost, but even ordinary books have been almost completely lost. Among the libraries in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces that still exist, only five have collections of more than 50,000 volumes. In the border areas of Yunnan and Guizhou, it is difficult to find those with more than 10,000 volumes. The problem of the source of reading materials is extremely serious. As for Western books, due to China's financial resources and the late purchase, the largest library has no more than 100,000 volumes, which have also been completely destroyed. No more than one-tenth of them were carried out. This time, the loss of Chinese books is so great and the looting is so heavy that it is unprecedented in the history of the country. Even if any country in the world has suffered losses due to war, it is not as significant as what China has experienced.</p>
<p>As for the antiquities that can be used for academic research, the valuable antiquities collected by the Peiping Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior have lost a total of more than 2,900 boxes. Private collections, such as the Zhou and Qin bronzes collected by the Pan family in Suzhou and the famous paintings collected by the Gu family in Yiyuan, have all been taken away by the Japanese army along with the aforementioned book collections of the Wu family and the Jiayetang Liu family. It can be proven that this is a planned destruction. Recently, the Japanese army also plundered more than 10 million volumes of textbooks stored in the two major bookstores, China and the World, in Shanghai, so that the lost books cannot be supplemented and the books that can be supplemented cannot be purchased. Therefore, the purpose of Japan is to completely eliminate China's cultural institutions, so that there are no books to read and no materials for research, etc.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Professors' Proposals for the National Education Conference (1)</h3>
<p>More than ten education professors in Shanghai organized the "Research Education Comrades Symposium" and submitted several important cases to this National Education Conference. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Proposal to Experimentally Promote Latinized Mandarin to Eliminate Illiteracy as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>(Reasons) Chinese characters are difficult and there are many illiterate people. In the past, various methods were used to promote literacy education, which proved that it is not easy to achieve effective results in the shortest period of time. If this continues, illiteracy will never be eliminated and the level of culture will never be improved. It has been proven that Latinized Mandarin (also known as New Characters) has been promoted in China for many years with remarkable results. Recently, it was tested in refugee shelters in Shanghai, and the results were very satisfactory. Refugees who were usually illiterate were able to read after studying for one month and write after studying for two months. The speed of results is far better than directly teaching Chinese characters. At this time of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction, it is imperative to eliminate illiteracy to enhance the power of resistance and reconstruction. Therefore, according to the principle of treating the symptoms in an emergency, we should immediately find ways to experiment with the promotion of Latinized Mandarin to promote the elimination of illiteracy.</p>
<p>(Methods) 1. The Latinized Mandarin Pinyin should uniformly use Mandarin as the standard, except when teaching, when the local dialect can be used as a transitional method, so as to popularize Mandarin and promote language unification. 2. According to the actual situation of the national language, divide it into Mandarin area, Guangdong area, Fujian area, and Jiangnan area to conduct experiments in order to promote it. 3. All areas where Mandarin is spoken and close to Mandarin are Mandarin areas, areas where Cantonese is spoken are Guangdong areas, western Zhejiang and Minxia are Fujian areas, and the area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang south of the Yangtze River is the Jiangnan area. 4. The Mandarin area should uniformly use the national pronunciation as the standard for teaching. In the other three areas, two classes should be opened at the same level, one class should use Mandarin from the beginning of teaching, and the other class should use local language for teaching as a transitional method. When a considerable level is reached, it should be changed to Mandarin to compare the effectiveness of the two teaching methods and then determine the pros and cons. 5. The Ministry of Education should designate several educational administration or academic research institutions in each area, and invite psychological, language, and educational experts to form a committee to be responsible for carrying out experimental promotion work.</p>
<p>Proposal to Organize an Examination Committee to Identify Self-Taught Youth</p>
<p>(Reasons) Since the War of Resistance, due to the expansion of the war zone and the loss of people's lives and property, most young people have been unable to continue their studies. Those who are ambitious can only study subjects on their own in order to remedy them. However, according to the existing education laws and regulations, young people who have not studied or graduated from formal schools cannot obtain education qualifications, so that ambitious young people are limited by their poor circumstances, and even if they study hard on their own, they will never have the hope of obtaining appropriate education qualifications. This is obviously contrary to the spirit of democracy. In order to encourage young people to study and promote the effectiveness of education, we should find ways to make the studies of self-taught young people legally recognized.</p>
<p>(Methods) The Ministry of Education should consider the situation in various provinces, cities, and counties and specially order the educational administrative organs of the provinces, cities, and counties to organize self-taught student examination committees, determine the examination subjects and admission standards for schools at all levels, and be responsible for handling the admission of self-taught students, so that they have the opportunity to enter schools or obtain graduation qualifications. The admission of self-taught students to universities and colleges should be handled by the Ministry of Education separately by organizing committees in different regions.</p>
<p>Proposal to Promote Secondary and University Education so that Poor Children and Working Youth Can Continue Their Studies</p>
<p>(Reasons) The admission procedures for secondary schools and universities in our country are extremely strict and the costs are quite high, so that poor children and working youth who want to continue their studies are not only unable to afford the financial resources, but also do not have the time. To remedy this defect, we should find ways to promote secondary and university education so that poor children and working youth can support themselves on the one hand and use their spare time to continue their studies on the other hand.</p>
<p>(Methods) 1. High schools, colleges, and universities may set up night classes, holiday classes, or other classes at appropriate times to recruit elective students, so that poor children and working youth can choose one or more courses according to their financial resources and possible time. After completing the courses and passing the examination, the school shall issue a certificate of completion of the course. If they can complete all the courses of a certain department or department and pass the examination, they shall be given a diploma in the same treatment as regular students. 2. Secondary schools, colleges, and universities that specialize in teaching at night or other spare time, if their equipment, training, and teaching results are investigated and found to be satisfactory by the competent educational administrative organ, shall enjoy the same treatment as regular schools. 3. High schools, colleges, and universities may consider the situation and admit elective students during regular class hours. The method is the same as in Article 1.</p>
<p>Proposal to Abolish the Grade Promotion System in Senior High Schools and Calculate Academic Progress in Units of Course</p>
<p>(Reasons) The current school system completely uses the grades of classes to represent the level of study. If a student fails an examination in a certain course, he must repeat the entire course for a certain grade. This not only wastes time, but also rereads the courses that have already been read, which will have a negative impact on psychology and learning efficiency.</p>
<p>(Methods) Senior high schools (including vocational and general courses) should abolish the grade promotion system and calculate academic progress in units of courses. Anyone who fails a certain course in the examination should only retake the course. Those who complete all the courses and pass the examination will be given a graduation certificate. Those who drop out of school or transfer schools midway will be given a study certificate calculated in courses. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Shanghai Education Committee to Postpone Organization and Continue to Proceed According to the Original Method</h3>
<p>After August 13, education in Shanghai developed, so the Ministry of Education paid much attention to it. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Education had appointed five selected members to organize an education committee to supervise education affairs in Shanghai. According to a Shanghai News Agency reporter who learned from relevant parties in the city, an order has been received from the Ministry of Education to temporarily postpone the organization of the education committee. All education affairs in the city will continue to proceed according to the past methods until the end of the semester, and then a decision will be made.</p>
<h3>Actively Promoting Fundraising for Education</h3>
<p>Qinghua Elementary and Middle School, located at 428 Baike Road, is known for its excellent management and strict discipline. The number of students has significantly increased this semester, indicating a thriving atmosphere. Recently, the school invited renowned pediatrician Dr. Zhong Yaoji to give lectures on hygiene and common knowledge, and Dr. Chu Wenhui to conduct physical examinations. Both gentlemen have been hired as school doctors, each taking on their respective responsibilities. The school is dedicated to supporting various charitable causes and has actively participated in past initiatives such as donating winter clothing and raising funds for disaster relief, achieving remarkable results. Currently, the Education Group of the Refugee Relief Association is raising funds for production and education, and the students of the school are competing to donate. They have already raised over 300 national currency yuan. Among them, Yao Xiyu, a sixth-grade student, donated the most at twelve yuan; Chun Shengyulong, a third-grade student, donated ten yuan; Yu Jiahun, a second-grade student, donated six yuan; Huang Jiazi, a third-grade student, Ying Rende, Ying Dingqiao, both second-grade students, Sheng Yuping, and Liang Youling, both first-grade students, each donated five yuan.</p>
<p>Soochow University and its Attached Middle School: Soochow University's three colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Law, along with its affiliated middle school, have a large student body this semester, totaling over 1,400 students. Since the beginning of the semester, all training and educational activities have been actively underway. Recently, the university has been vigorously promoting the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's fundraising campaign for Shanghai refugee production and education expenses. Fundraising has begun separately in the three colleges and the affiliated middle school, with considerable success. In the colleges of Arts and Sciences, a fundraising committee composed of faculty, staff, and students has been formed and divided into six teams to carry out the campaign. It is planned to award a prize flag to the team with the best results and to the individual who raises the most funds, to encourage participation.</p>

<h3>Paramount Defeats Guoguang; Extremely Close; Result 65 to 53; Decided in Overtime</h3>
<p>There were three make-up games in the Western Youth Basketball League last night. Aurora University was heavily defeated by MacKenzie 7-47. In the first half, the score was 23-6, so the yellow-wrapped [team] had no one to compete with. In the second game, Youlian played Hualian. After the start of the game, Hualian went straight up and led all the way. At the end of the first half, Hualian unexpectedly took the lead with 35-16, a lead of as much as nineteen points. Although Youlian tried hard to retaliate, they were still heavily defeated by Hualian 41-63. The last game was between Paramount and Guoguang. At the end of the first half, Paramount led 29-22. Changing sides to fight again, Paramount transferred Qu Xilin and Mai Youliang, so they were taken advantage of by Guoguang, chasing the score to 45-43, with only one goal difference. Although Lu Zhongen and Xu Wenkui were urgently transferred, Guoguang still chased the score to 35-35. Zhang Jinxuan made both shots, and Guoguang took the lead with 41-37. There were still eight minutes left, Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun both fouled, and Guoguang's Wang Nanqun and Li Zude did not let go, the difference had reached five points. After this, the situation was all spent in turbulent waves. Paramount struggled to catch up. In the last two minutes, Xu Wenkui caught up with one shot to make the score 48-49. The situation was extremely tense. Paramount's generals were all panicked. Even if they were as calm as Changjiao Lu, they had to make a half-court shot. However, Guoguang's Li Zude was not careful at this time and fouled under the basket. Xu Wenkui made one of two free throws, 49-49, and Paramount escaped from death. Time was up, and the two sides did not separate. Therefore, the game was extended to determine the winner. In overtime, Paramount scored five goals in one breath. Guoguang's Zhang Jinxuan only pulled back one city, and Cai Yanxiong immediately returned the favor. Wang Nanqun scored again, but Paramount's Chen Xuechong scored four consecutive points, and the bell rang loudly. Guoguang was defeated miserably with 53-65.</p>

<h3>Finance: Northern Syndicate Stops Buying and Starts Selling; Cash Rebound Plunges Sharply; Once Retreated to 2155 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the off-market situation of cash *sha chi* [likely refers to gold bars], suddenly rebounded and plunged sharply. It was actually because of the saying that Britain would lend us another £50,000 of British gold, and it was heard that other new loans were still under negotiation. Because of this, foreign exchange tended to be loose, and people's hearts were weak and depressed. Sellers flocked, and the desire of Northern Syndicate speculators to come out was even more urgent than others, and the price was unsustainable and collapsed. However, in the middle of the way, because the securities syndicate and a certain foreign bank and local syndicate mutually searched and purchased, it rose slightly for a while. In the end, after hearing unfavorable news from many parties, the securities syndicate turned from buying to selling, and the upward trend was difficult to maintain for a long time. As a result, it plunged by 28 yuan, and transactions were smooth. Jewelry gold in silver shops also followed suit and returned by a small three yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also tended to be stable.</p>
<p>*Sha Chi* Plunges Twenty-Eight Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar of ten taels, the initial selling price was about 2,190 yuan. Those who entered the market were cautious and watched. Before long, the securities syndicate suddenly came to throw and plug, so the market situation was immediately tired, and it was shouted down to 80 yuan before it was opened. It was already 10:15. First, the securities syndicate sold ten taels to the money exchange industry, and the opening price was 2,175 yuan, which was 15 yuan lower than the previous Saturday. After the opening, gold shops also came to sell, so they continued to decline. Gold shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, priced at 72 yuan. Following this, the securities syndicate also sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry at the same price. After this, the securities syndicate suddenly changed from selling to buying, and the local syndicate and a certain foreign bank also followed suit to search and purchase, so the price also rebounded immediately. The securities syndicate bought 150 taels from the money exchange industry, jumping to 82 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop also bought 100 taels from another money exchange industry on behalf of the local syndicate, for 80 yuan. At the same price, a certain money exchange industry again absorbed 50 taels from the same industry on behalf of a foreign bank. Before long, a certain silver shop returned 50 taels to the securities syndicate, priced at 85 yuan. It was already 11:30. At that time, it was suddenly heard that Britain would lend China another £5 million of British gold, and foreign exchange was also gradually rebounding. People's hearts were tired downwards again, and the securities syndicate stopped buying and watched. The seller shouted down to 82-3 yuan, but it was still difficult to find a match. Until noon, it was not opened, so the noon closing price was still 85 yuan. In the afternoon, although a certain money exchange industry made a profit and bought more than 300 taels, because the Northern Syndicate also entrusted another money exchange industry and the securities syndicate tended to sell, and foreign exchange was also gradually reported to be loose, the price rebounded downwards again. First, the money exchange industry mutually traded 50 taels, priced at 75 yuan, and then mutually traded 100 taels, priced at 76 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry and the securities syndicate forcibly sold more than 200 taels, and the price was lowered to 55 yuan, all of which were taken in by gold shops and money exchange industries. After this, because the Northern Syndicate stopped selling, it rebounded upwards again. A certain money exchange industry bought 50 taels from the silver shop syndicate, priced at 2,162 yuan, which was the evening closing price. It was heard that after closing, there were still people coming to sell at the evening closing price, but it was not opened. As a result, it was 28 yuan lower than the previous Saturday (the difference between the whole day's state yuan). The book price gold of cash shops was sold at 2,170 yuan and bought at 2,155 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no opening.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at Small Three Yuan</p>
<p>The cash-out price of gold ornaments in silver shops per tael was not changed at the beginning. Until 10 o'clock, because *sha chi* opened lower by more than 10 yuan, it was also listed at a small one yuan. Then at 2:45 in the afternoon, because *sha chi* plunged sharply again, it was relisted at a small two yuan. Datongxing Laoqingyun and other changed counties to 219 yuan, new colleagues to 217 yuan, and bought at 211 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Pure Gold Unanimously Unchanged</p>
<p>The buying price of Chinese cash by the Central Bank was still 1,210 yuan and 0.9 cents. The listed customs gold was also still 2 yuan, 3 corners, 9 points and 4 mils. The Shanghai standard listed gold price was also unchanged at 1,206 yuan and 2 corners, which was due to the fact that the London telegram British pure gold rebounded to be stable on the 4th, and was still 7 pounds, 8 shillings and 4 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Lend to China Again; The Exchange Market Suddenly Loosens After Being Tight; The Hong Kong Exchange Rate Does Not Share Glory or Disgrace</h3>
<p>The exchange market opened yesterday, and the potential trend was weak. British gold once retreated to 8 pence 0.9375, and the US exchange rate also weakened to 15.8125 yuan (the settlement price of foreign firms). Afterwards, it suddenly rebounded and turned loose. The initial tightness was because major foreign firms and Chinese cotton yarn syndicates were competing to suck up [funds], and at that time, foreign banks' willingness to sell was quite weak. Later, because it was heard that Britain was helping China economically and would have another £5 million loan to China, foreign banks' willingness to sell became stronger, and in addition, the telegram from Hong Kong suddenly came to strongly sell, so it was loose. As a result, both British and US exchange rates were loose, and transactions were quite strong. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, although foreign firms and money exchange industries mutually bought and settled, because foreign banks' willingness to supply was also strong, the situation was still stable.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the large London strips, the recent term was still flat, and the long term continued to grow by 0.0625. The New York silver price was the same as before, and there was no increase or decrease in London raw gold. The exchange rate of British exchange to the US was a small three cents, and to France and Shanghai, they were unchanged. The US exchange rate fell by 0.0625 against the British exchange rate, unchanged against the French exchange rate, and fell by 2 points against the Shanghai exchange rate. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates were fixed as before. The bank's selling price in the morning was British exchange at 8 pence and 125 mils, and the US exchange rate was 15 yuan and 843,275 mils, which was flat compared to the British and US exchange rates last weekend. After the opening, foreign banks' willingness to sell was quite weak, and foreign firms' settlement was strong, so the market trend was weak. Foreign firms settled at a Magallanes British gold rate of 8 pence and 0.9375 mils. The HSBC listing and silver balance tax were announced, and there were no changes. At this time, Chinese cotton yarn syndicates also bought Hua Bi US exchange at 15 yuan and 8125 mils. At that time, it was suddenly heard that Britain would have another £5 million British gold loan, so foreign banks' willingness to sell turned stronger, so the potential trend also gradually returned to flat. HSBC Magallanes sold British gold to foreign firms at 8 pence and 125 mils. Following this, a certain Dutch bank sold US exchange to foreign firms at 15 yuan and 875 mils. Near noon, a foreign bank, Anda, also sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 54 yuan and 375 mils, and the situation was stable. The bank's selling price at the noon closing was British gold at 8 pence and 125 mils, and the US exchange rate was 15 yuan and 875 mils.</p>
<p>Later in the market, Hong Kong Electric sold British gold to Unilever and a certain bank at 8 pence and 140,625 mils, and also US exchange at 15 yuan and 906,25 mils, so the potential trend was strong. After this, foreign firms absorbed HSBC British gold at 8 pence and 125 mils. Following this, [foreign firms] again settled a certain bank's US exchange at 15 yuan and 875 mils. Finally, the foreign bank Dutch sold Hong Kong exchange to the money exchange industry at 54 yuan and 375 mils, so the situation was slightly flat. The bank's selling price at the evening closing was British exchange at 8 pence and 140,625 mils, and the US exchange rate was 15 yuan and 906,25 mils. As a result, it was 0.015625 longer than last Saturday in British gold, and 0.0625 looser in US exchange. Hong Kong exchange still had no glory or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Discount Reaches 50 Yuan; A Crazy Increase of 9 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange clearing bill discount rate increased again to 50 yuan (per thousand yuan) due to the increasing need for cash and the eagerness of those seeking it. Therefore, the market's discount rate also soared, exceeding 50 yuan. From the beginning of the morning, it was strongly at 50 yuan, then gradually increased to 52 yuan, 51 yuan at noon, and there was no change in the afternoon, still 51 yuan, a sharp increase of 9 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Many Selling Foreign Currency; British Gold Pound Plummets 5 Corners</h3>
<p>The British and Japanese pure gold did not move last Saturday, and the British and American exchange rates fell by 0.0625. Yesterday, the settlement of foreign exchange by foreign firms was very strong, and the supply from banks was not refreshing, and the trend was weak. Later, the Hong Kong electricity sell-off was slightly stronger, and the market price gradually flattened. As a result, the slight weakness of *sha chi* opened and showed a sluggish trend. Because the daily increase in shipping was too high, the risk to retail investors was extremely high, and the desire to come out was strong, and the price fell. The Tianjin syndicate initially pretended to maintain it, slightly absorbing it to pull up the market price. Later, they tried their best to sell and realize profits, so the market price rose and fell suddenly, and the change was very large. The whole day's transactions were chaotic and the trend was weak. Foreign currencies fluctuated with the gold price, and many wealthy people made profits and sold. British and American gold pounds fell sharply, and British and American gold notes and other undelivered drafts weakened and rose, but because the gold price fell, the size was reduced. The whole day's transactions had more sellers, and most of them fell, and the trend was weak. The association's transactions were mediocre, and the Hong Kong ticket transaction was especially large. Huitong transferred Qintai to enter the Hong Kong ticket for 1,000 yuan, Taihexing transferred Qintai to enter the Hong Kong ticket for 5,000 yuan, Litong transferred Qintai to enter the Hong Kong ticket for 900 yuan, Huitong transferred Hengmao to enter the US dollar note for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market price, British gold pound fell by 5 corners, British gold note fell by 5 points, US gold pound fell by 3 corners, US gold note fell by 1 point and 5 mils, Hong Kong ticket fell by 3 mils, French franc ticket fell by 5 haos, Singapore ticket and Canadian ticket each fell by 1 point, Philippine ticket fell by 2 points, Australian gold ticket fell by 4 corners, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Prices Soar; All for Moving Out to Foreign Countries; Rice Merchants Take the Opportunity to Hoard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from each syndicate were even scarcer, with four or five arriving from the river downstream, and more than two thousand bags of car transport. It turns out that a certain party has been searching and handling exports on a large scale in Changzhou and Xixi and other places, and has monopolized and raised the price of brown rice to 11 yuan and 12 corners, resulting in scarce sources in Shanghai and high prices for goods. White japonica rice is already around 15 yuan. Under this environment, Shanghai customers want to protect their principal, so they all insist on high prices and are unwilling to let go easily. The market immediately began to gallop, and the situation was chaotic after being moved by the hoarders and this street. As a result, the rise in the market of thick and thin japonica rice was uneven, ranging from 2 to 3 or 4 corners. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian also raised 3 or 4 corners together, and Bian Yuan also rose more than 3 corners. Although the market limits the price to 14 yuan, it is originally a means of secretly raising the price of secondary rice. In reality, where is the limit? The advent of this situation is still in its infancy. In the coming days, it will be difficult, so it is hoped that the authorities will be able to come out to help. As for the rice and grain in the inland, it is not little. If it is not moved out to foreign countries, the people's food will not be so panic.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Market Continues to Fall by 5 Points; Imported Flour Arriving in Shanghai Has Some Influence; Wheat Market Remains Stalled</h3>
<p>The flour market has gradually weakened yesterday. It has been checked that since the end of last week, the customer syndicate has had a batch of transactions, and the market has continued to inquire yesterday. However, in the recent voice of imported flour arriving in Shanghai, the selling price has repeatedly fallen, and the future of the flour is not without influence. Moreover, 7,353 tons of Australian wheat have been newly arrived, and the raw materials of each factory have frequently increased, and the customer orders have to be given preferential treatment. It is heard that the factory price has continued to be 5 points lower, only opening at 4 yuan and 6 and a half corners. At the same time, the wholesale price in this street has also fallen from 4 yuan and 7 and a half corners to 7 corners. The city has been handled by the North and South Syndicates for a total of 50,000 to 60,000 bags of No. 2 flour of each brand of cars and ships and miscellaneous brands of flour. It is heard that the flour sold by the customer syndicate has not yet been delivered in cash, and it is generally delivered successively.</p>
<p>Recently, the wheat market has been short of both supply and demand, and has been stalled for many days. Yesterday was the beginning of the week, but the market was still waiting and not moving forward. The reason is actually due to the impact of the dumping of imported flour wheat. The sellers held on to the cost relationship, and the factories intended to suppress the size. As a result of the insistence of both parties, there was no transaction in a single package.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Is Said to Be Controlled; Transshipment and Digestion Are Very Strong; Imported Rice Shouted at 16 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer *xian* rice and customer *hua* rice was very greedy. More than 5,000 packages of each *xian* rice in Jingwu were opened. In addition to the customer hoarders and Japanese merchants, the appetite of this street also increased. Moreover, due to the high production price, those who directly handle sales in the production area also absorbed in the Shanghai market. There was also a rumor in the market that Wuhu had been controlled by the Japanese side and that only one Japanese merchant could operate the sales, so people's hearts were even more excited, and the market rose sharply by 3 or 4 corners. Even the Saigon foreign rice, which is often silent, had a shouted price of 16 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Recovers in the Aftermarket; China Electric Shares Rise Significantly</h3>
<p>The securities off-market situation was still brewing and firm yesterday morning. Because Yuanda no longer had goods to sell, a huge rebound suddenly rose in the afternoon, and the rising wind gradually strengthened. The market also rumored that a new loan had been successfully made. In fact, this kind of rumor has been around for a long time. The sudden rise in the stall was entirely because the large sellers had stopped selling, and the buyers' interest was strong. This has long been expected by this newspaper. Afterwards, because Category C has rushed out of 8 yuan and Category E has rushed out of 7 yuan, even if there is a return wind, it still has to be bullish. In the morning, Chengkang was the first to absorb, gaining the upper hand, and Tongkang followed up to do more. No. 10 and retail long positions closed, and finally rose slightly by two or three corners. In the afternoon, the market has recovered, and Tiansheng's absorption is more surging after opening. Tongkang's long positions increased again, and retail investors also bought. The money industry helped also entered more and exited less, and rose unanimously. The multi-party rose by as much as seven and a half corners, and if only the large households do not oppress them again in the future, they can continue to rise. As a result, market prices rose unanimously, ranging from 6 corners to 1 yuan. The total number of transactions is estimated to be about 1.2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 100 shares of China Electric Power shares were traded, priced at 5 yuan, 3 corners and 5 points.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: As the Season Turns, Dealers Scramble for Fine Yarn; Market Uniquely Rises by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains stable, with a slightly soft trend. This is because the actual demand is not as strong as in previous days. However, transactions of 10-count coarse yarn by the Yunnan group can still be maintained. Acceptance by the Tianjin group is slightly sluggish, and other groups show no signs of activity. This makes people feel tired. As for dealers, most believe the market will rise, and many are hoarding goods. Therefore, there is little trading among themselves recently. However, some are still taking advantage of the rising gold prices to buy in slightly, but this has not stimulated the market. Dealers are fiercely competing to buy 32-count and 42-count fine yarns. As the climate turns to summer, the demand for these fine yarns increases, and the market also has low inventory, so the market is uniquely strong.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Situation: At the opening of the market this morning, there was still no sign of actual improvement in transactions. No groups sent telegrams with orders, so people felt relaxed. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was still 399 yuan, not much different from the previous day. Shortly after, the Yunnan group came to purchase coarse and fine yarns again, but the volume was not large, and the market price rose slightly, a minimal increase. However, 10-count coarse yarn still showed a tight situation. By the closing of the market, it was heard that gold was still rising, and Double Horse yarn returned to 400 yuan. The market became even quieter in the afternoon, with very few people attending. Transactions by out-of-town groups were still not strong. Double Horse yarn retreated slightly by five jiao to 399.5 yuan. In the end, the total volume of transactions by all groups for the day was 1,042 bales, with transactions among dealers still accounting for more than half. The average price of 20-count yarn was similar to the previous day, but 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count fine yarn were firm and rose by 1.2 yuan each. The mills have not taken any action. The transaction volume purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market feels particularly sluggish because the exchange rate has soared, effectively increasing prices. Therefore, sales by out-of-town groups are becoming weaker. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 335 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 330 to 329 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Continues to Rise; Cotton Firms Suspend Transactions</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In Lancashire, fabric sales are brisk, and the demand for cotton is very strong. However, there is no sign that the US government will release loan cotton. The amount of cotton on the market is not large, and Lancashire is searching everywhere to buy it. As a result, the New York cotton market is rising, repeatedly reaching new highs. Yesterday, the March price reached a new high of 8.71. Based on various reports, the cotton market is likely to continue to rise. Yesterday, New York rose by five or six points. India also suspended trading due to Gandhi's hunger strike. According to a telegram received by a major cotton firm in this city, the predicted price of White Rock cotton in April and May is 154 rupees and 7.5 points. Egyptian cotton rose by three or four points. Yesterday, the exchange rate eased slightly. Converted to legal tender, the price of US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 4 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Because the overseas cotton market continues to rise, when converted to legal tender, prices have risen sharply by 4 or 5 yuan per dan compared to a few days ago, so transactions are relatively light. However, the supply of local cotton brands is scarce, and there may be interruptions. Some firms have already purchased foreign cotton, and the profit on forward shipments is already 5 or 6 yuan per dan. All firms are taking advantage of this high price to sell. Therefore, local cotton brokers have been running around trying to sell for days. Yesterday, He Feng Factory imported 100 bales of US upland Peng Jia Pu cotton at a price of 78 yuan to the factory. Gu Qian Ji Cotton Firm imported 500 bales of Indian White Rock cotton at a price of 71 yuan, delivered to the warehouse. In addition, Shanghai Yarn Factory imported 500 bales of Indian cotton, and Da Jin imported 500 bales. The factory delivery prices of yesterday's cotton are listed below:</p>
<h3>Firewood Cotton: Rises to 70 Yuan, Still Cash Price</h3>
<p>Although the local cotton business is sluggish, selling prices continue to rise. This is because various sources of supply are subject to various restrictions, and there is a risk of disruption. Therefore, the market price has risen to the point where it cannot rise any further. However, inventories are already weak, and there is no hope of new arrivals, so the market price is difficult to ease. New highs for firewood cotton are emerging one after another, and the spot price has reached 70 yuan. The supply from northern Jiangsu is still scarce, with only 150 bales of fine short-staple cotton from Xia Sha. No transactions have been made by the factories. There are 14,000 bales of Yao cotton from Ningbo. Today, 500 pieces of organic cotton will be shipped to Qingdao. The opening market prices and quantities of spot cotton are listed on the left:</p>
<p>120 Pieces Exchange at Warehouse with Draft</p>
<p>200 Bales Cash Exchange at Warehouse</p>
<p>200 Bales Cash Exchange at Warehouse</p>
<p>160 Bales Cash Exchange at Warehouse</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: The Oil Market Goes Off Course; Crude Oil Has a Tendency to Soar; Dalian Guangbing Rises Another Ten Cents</h3>
<p>The sentiment in the oil market is becoming increasingly agitated, and the confusion in buying and selling attitudes is rare. Price discussions for various crude soybean oils are going off course. Yesterday, soybean oil rose by one yuan, and peanut oil soared by 1.7 yuan, and the momentum has not stopped, with a great tendency to soar. An estimated 800 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil, 100 pieces of Tai Cang crude oil, and more than 700 cans of Qingdao canned crude oil were handled by local and Hong Kong groups. Currently, more than 700 pieces of soybean oil have been traded, and forward delivery orders must be over 1,800 barrels. The only soybean cake purchased and sold was 1,000 pieces of Xie Feng Factory's Yuan Long Cake in Changzhou, purchased by the Fuzhou group, at a price of 3.445 yuan, with little change from the previous market. However, Dalian Guangbing, manipulated by speculators, jumped another ten cents, with 5,000 pieces for April delivery at a price of 3.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: New Shan Nai Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>New Shan Nai Goods: It is heard that a certain firm has already purchased dozens of pieces from Shantou, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday. It is found that the old inventory here is about to run out. Therefore, although the quality of the first batch of new goods is slightly inferior, the color is whiter and cleaner, and the output this year is not large, and land prices are high. It is predicted that the future firm offer will be on par with the recent market price (old goods selling for 25 yuan).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Urgent Need to Expedite Delivery of Goods Ordered from Afar</h3>
<p>National Cloth White goods are turning firm. Plain bleached light-colored fabrics and fine yarn woven goods sell well, and prices are stable. Sales of dark-colored piece goods are sluggish, and prices are uniquely depressed. Due to the increase in factory prices, White Goods Ewo coarse cloth rose yesterday by 10 cents per piece for the 9-pound and 11-pound varieties, and by 20 cents per piece for the 13-pound, 14-pound, and 16-pound varieties. The price of 9-pound underwear cloth rose by 5 cents. However, interest from out-of-town groups is very weak. Fine cloth and fine twill sales have increased slightly due to firm factory prices, and spot goods have risen by about 5 cents per piece. Ningbo groups have purchased 50 bales of Cannon and Big Peng brand fine cloth and fine twill. Guangdong groups have purchased nearly 200 bales of Fugui, Shen Da, Sanhua, and Ai Zi brand fine twill. Light-colored piece goods for spring and summer, such as foreign yarn, poplin, white satin, and bleached cloth, are being purchased more and more actively by nearby groups from Wen, Yong, and Min. Goods purchased from afar in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tianjin are urgently needed for delivery. Factories are very busy with active delivery work, and most selling prices are trending upwards. Most dark-colored piece goods are in stock. Based on current yarn, thread, and grey cloth raw material calculations, the selling prices barely cover costs.</p>
<p>Sales of Dong cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill remained sluggish in the local market yesterday. Tianjin groups slightly increased their purchases of spot goods, and there were many forward sales. There were more floating traders with high-end fine cloth. The market is fatigued and urgently seeks to sell. Therefore, the price decline of fine cloth of Long Tou, Cai Qiu, and Fei Yu brands is the most severe, falling sharply by 20 cents per piece. The middle-grade Wu Fu and Shuang Yu are relatively stable, falling by 10 cents per piece. Approximately 800 pieces were traded today. Major local dealers still expect prices to rise.</p>
<p>Today, 2,680 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Spring Sales Launch</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of woolen cloth and fur goods increased sharply. This is because the Lantern Festival has passed, and spring sales have officially launched. Transactions by local woolen cloth, foreign goods, and silk and satin stores are increasing daily. The business of Western-style tailors and clothing is also continuing to boom. Western-style clothing materials are selling well. There are significant sales to large wholesalers and spot foreign firms at public tea parties. Based on recent purchases by various groups, in view of Shanghai's commercial prosperity, they are confidently increasing their purchases. Brokers are also extending credit to promote business. Brokers for firms such as An Kai Di Ben Te Foreign Firm and Yi Chang Tai Woolen Firm are busy running around trying to sell fabric samples. Italian goods priced at 8 or 9 yuan per yard, similar to the quality of No. 42,000 fabrics, are selling the best.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Normal Sales</h3>
<p>The sales market for yellow soybeans, under this soaring momentum, is instead showing signs of decline. In short, it is constrained by various environmental factors, people's minds are changing, and speculative thinking is strong, resulting in the market price rising sharply. Yesterday, more than 30 military units of April Dalian soybeans were traded, at a price of 8.4 yuan and 4.2 cents, which is 2 cents higher than the market last Saturday. Only one carload of spot soybeans was traded, at a price of 8.45 yuan. The price of Pudong Du soybeans has reached 10 yuan, with 100 bags successfully delivered. 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were successfully opened, at a price of 8.25 to 8.35 yuan. There were also 100 bags of Jiading soybeans newly on the market, at a price of 7.7 yuan and 7.95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Tong'an Dried Longan: Price Rises 3.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>More than 50 boxes of Tong'an sun-dried meat that arrived before the major closing were not opened due to increased costs. According to a telegram from out of town, the price needs to rise by 4 yuan, but the firm's counter-offer has not been close, so no transactions have been made. It is now heard that price negotiations between the two parties are close to agreement, and the price will be increased by 3.5 yuan based on the previous offer.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: US and French Silk Sales Pale in Comparison; Italian Rayon Another 5,000+ Boxes Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a holiday in New York, and sentiment in Yokohama remained firm. Prices for January and February were 1,055 yuan, up 24 yuan; April was 1,050 yuan, up 29 yuan; May was 1,032 yuan, up 21 yuan; June was 1,009 yuan, up 6 yuan; July was 1,013 yuan, up 10 yuan; the most distant August was 1,018 yuan, up 12 yuan; spot goods were 1,055 yuan, up 20 yuan. Although the prices of various futures contracts retreated slightly at the close, based on the sentiment in the morning market, the future of the silk market still seems to be firm.</p>
<p>Local Situation: The re-opened market price for White Factory B-grade silk was 1,920 yuan. Although transactions were sporadic, silk prices remained extremely hot due to the limited domestic inventory. Yesterday, the B-grade Golden Monkey grade opened at 1,920 yuan. It is predicted that the market atmosphere will not ease for a while. The Indian Silk Market also saw hoarding yesterday. The White Head Firm of Samsung grade imported 85 loads of Thousand Gold Silk and Reeled Silk. Market prices rose by 10 to 20 yuan. Looking back at silk sales in England and France, they paled in comparison. This is because the prices of silk in Shanghai and the US and France have been very far apart recently.</p>
<p>A large quantity of Italian rayon has been shipped here. It was previously reported that the Italian ship "Contro Piro Ecamanno" brought 4,800 boxes on the 21st of last month. On the 5th (the day before yesterday), another Italian ship, "Contro Rosso", arrived in Shanghai with even more rayon, totaling 5,300 boxes. This is a new record for rayon imports since the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Total Volume of Chaozhou Sugar Shipped in 1938</h3>
<p>According to a Shantou dispatch, the total volume of Chaozhou sugar exported in 1938 was 800,000+6,000+ bags. Due to transportation difficulties, except for Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Ningbo, etc., which were directly shipped as usual, Hankou was transshipped via Hong Kong. There were no shipments to places such as Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Nanjing, and Jinan. However, the total volume was higher than in 1937. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to the above table, there were also 35,127 bags shipped from Qingdao to Qingzhou. The total is 800,000+6,000+11+bags</p>
<h3>Reply to Mr. Xu's Inquiry About乙Bond Market Price</h3>
<p>To Mr. Xu Shuming,</p>
<p>The market price of the B-type bond on the 1st (i.e., the one seen in the 2nd day newspaper, the same below) was 48.85, and the market price on the 2nd was 48.90, an increase of five points. However, in the newspaper on the 3rd, "8" was mistakenly printed as "9", resulting in 49.90. This error of one character caused a slight discrepancy, causing you to inquire, which is greatly appreciated! - Editor</p>

<h3>Alarming News in the Suburbs; Japanese Troops in Wusong Attacked; Fan Shilin's Troops Killed a Japanese Captain; Chinese Troops in Pudong Determined to Wait for an Opportunity to Launch a Major Offensive</h3>
<p>The guerrillas of Fan Shilin's troops advanced towards Wusong last night (the 5th) in a light drizzle and encountered Japanese troops. Fan's troops charged in the rain, unstoppable, killing a Japanese captain named Yamada and more than 20 soldiers, capturing a light machine gun and more than 10 automatic rifles. Fan's troops only had three squad leaders wounded. When the main force of the Japanese troops heard the news, they rushed to the scene, but Fan had already led his troops far away.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Deployed with Considerable Strength</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops used the puppet "army" leader Xu Hongfa to reorganize more than 100 low-quality troops under Qin Xingyan, such as Liu Xinru, Du Tianpeng, Liu Dezhong, and Zhang Lingen, into the puppet "army" in the Shangnan border area of Pudong, they were stationed separately around Beicai Town. These people are willing to act as a barrier for the Japanese troops, cutting off the direct encounters between the Japanese army and the guerrillas in the Bailianjing area of Nanmatou. Moreover, after they joined forces with Xu Hongfa, no one controls them, their ambitions exploded, and they committed all kinds of evil. Furthermore, they have successively recruited bandits north of the railway, and the number has increased to more than 200 people. The guerrillas have repeatedly urged them to quickly turn against the Japanese and redeem themselves, but their ambitions are difficult to control, and they have not awakened. Therefore, the various units of the Chinese army have deployed considerable strength and are determined to wait for an opportunity to launch a painful suppression to eliminate hidden dangers. Therefore, in recent days, the situation along the Shangnan Railway and the Beicai area of Bailianjing Nanmatou has been tense, with alarming news, as if a war is about to break out. The more well-off villagers have been forced to move away. Both the Japanese and puppet troops are even more terrified. They are conducting extremely strict searches of land and water traffic and civilians entering and leaving the area, and anyone who does not carry a puppet "citizen's card" is shot to death. Three civilians have been tragically killed at the Bailianjing port.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Attempt to Defend Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that the Japanese puppet authorities are deeply concerned about the increasing activity of the Chinese guerrillas around Shanghai and have decided to send a special unit of 500 "pacification troops" from the "Public Security Department" of the "Maintenance Government" to the area bordering the concession to curb anti-Japanese elements. It is heard that the Japanese army took this action because it felt that the number of soldiers stationed in the guerrilla areas behind the lines was insufficient. According to Chinese sources, these 500 men in the special unit are all composed of bandits and undisciplined and poorly armed individuals. It is heard that a portion of the so-called "pacification troops" has already arrived at designated locations in the Japanese-controlled area of western Shanghai. At the same time, guerrilla activity in the suburbs of Shanghai continues unabated. Many railways and highways in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been destroyed by guerrillas. These land transportation lines cannot maintain regular traffic. Mobile battles occur daily in Tinglin, Yexie, and Chuansha in southern Pudong. Gunshots are heard in the western district of Shanghai every once in a while. The Japanese army is currently taking strict precautions in and around Shanghai, and passengers landing at various wharves on the Huangpu River are also being subjected to strict checks. The long-rumored suppression campaign by the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu against the guerrilla teams has been halted, because the mobile units are skilled in combat, and the Japanese army has been defeated.</p>
<h3>Soybean and Rice Industry Association Resolved Yesterday: Maintain the Original Price Limit; Advise Merchants to Consider the Overall Situation and Comply Together; and Send a Letter to the Authorities of the Two Concessions to Properly Plan for Solutions</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the rice price in Shanghai has risen to the limited price of 14 yuan per shi, the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 3 pm yesterday. The members present were Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Qiangeng, Cai Yukun, Jiang Hongbin, She Bingwen, Xing Zhigang, Yan Xiaoquan, Yang Heqing, etc. Xing Zhigang was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. After reporting on the association's affairs, they discussed "the issue of how to deal with the rice price rising to the original limit" and resolved that the current high rice price is entirely due to foreign merchants purchasing in large quantities in the interior, and the rice price in the producing areas is higher than in Shanghai, so that traders are hesitant, and the goods arriving gradually become scarce. However, there are still 600,000 to 700,000 bags of rice in stock in Shanghai, which will not be scarce for a while. For the sake of maintaining the people's food, the original price limit should be maintained, and the highest price of white rice should not exceed 14 yuan. An announcement should be made to the market and merchants should be advised to consider the overall situation and comply together. However, if the price in the producing areas continues to rise, then the goods coming in the future will become even scarcer, and the inventory in Shanghai will gradually become thin. At that time, there may be a concern about panic. The rice market situation should now be reported to the authorities of the two concessions, and they should be asked to properly plan for solutions, such as ordering foreign rice or other methods, as a precautionary measure. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.</p>
<p>Merchants Stop Purchasing and Hoarders Take Advantage</p>
<p>Due to the direct purchasing by the Japanese puppets in the producing areas, the price of No. 1 white rice in the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Market rose to the limited price of 14 yuan yesterday. Traders stopped purchasing because the cost of rice shipped from the producing areas to Shanghai was higher than the Shanghai market, resulting in only 2,000 to 3,000 bags arriving each day. General hoarders refused to sell, and market prices tended to exceed the 14 yuan limit. Although the market management committee tried its best to persuade them, off-the-books transactions exceeded 14 yuan. Retail sales in various rice stores have risen to 14.5 yuan per shi.</p>
<p>Separate Persuasion to Maintain People's Food</p>
<p>After the Soybean and Rice Industry Association resolved yesterday to maintain the original price limit of 14 yuan, committee members Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, etc. separately persuaded merchants from Changshu and other places to consider the overall situation and maintain the people's food in Shanghai. It was also decided that personnel would be sent to the Public Concession Board and the French Concession Public Works Bureau today to report on the rice market situation and request them to quickly plan for solutions to avoid panic among the people of Shanghai. It is heard that the Grain Management Committee established by the concession authorities attaches great importance to the people's food within the concession. Fortunately, there is a total of 600,000 to 700,000 bags of rice in stock within the concession, which is enough to supply the people for three months. Therefore, it is believed that the people's food within the Shanghai concession will not be lacking or cause panic for the time being.</p>
<p>North China Merchants Order Foreign Rice</p>
<p>A reporter from "New Voice News" learned from rice industry sources yesterday that the rice purchased by the Japanese puppets from the producing areas is mainly transported to North China. Recently, it has been widely rumored that the Japanese puppets intend to control the rice in the producing areas, and purchasers of rice must have a purchase permit. If this rumor becomes a reality, the transportation of rice to Shanghai will inevitably be further affected. In addition, North China merchants have entrusted foreign firms to order foreign rice, with a total amount exceeding 500,000 bags. They are all loaded onto ships and transported directly to North China for delivery, which has led to an increase in the price of foreign rice. The cost per bag is 17 or 18 yuan, so the price of foreign rice in Shanghai has also risen accordingly.</p>
<h3>After the Money Shop is Listed, the Association Holds an Annual Meeting; Stipulates the Money Shops of the North and South Markets Each Month; The Market Resumes Noon Trading and Will Sacrifice to the Former Directors</h3>

All executive committee members and managers of various shops, Yan Dayou, Lu Shuchen, Xu Wenqing, Hu Chunxiang, Zhang Wenbo, Zhang Mengzhou, Xi Jiming, Shen Jingliang, Pei Yunqing, etc., were present. Xi Jiming chaired the meeting and Ge Huaiqing recorded it. First, the chairman reported on the association's affairs and the budget settlement. Then, the managers of various shops exchanged views on the business policies after the listing. It was decided to support factories and firms in the national goods industry to promote their development. All loans will adopt a guarantee system. The meeting adjourned at 4 pm.</p>
<p>Stipulate North and South Market Money Shops Each Month</p>
<p>The following are the money shops of the North and South markets from April 1939 to March 1940.

<p>Resume Noon Trading and Extend Exchange</p>
<p>The money industry market stopped trading at noon after the Shanghai battlefield broke out. Now, in view of the restoration of order in the concession and the gradual recovery of transactions in various industries, the market committee decided to resume noon trading on March 6th. The announced interbank lending rate for the morning and noon markets yesterday was 1 jiao per 1,000 yuan for daily lending. Noon trading is mainly in cash. The time for the money industry bill exchange is extended to 4 pm, because the bank bill exchange time has been extended to 3:30 pm since March 1st. For the sake of coordination, the money industry has also extended its time accordingly.</p>
<p>North Market Guild Hall Public Sacrifice to Former Directors</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association usually holds an annual meeting on the Lantern Festival every year to report on the account and discuss new business policies. The location is Neiyuan in the South Market. On the last day of the Lantern Festival, a public sacrifice to the former directors is held at the North Market Guild Hall. This year, because Neiyuan has been designated as a refugee area, all gatherings cannot be held. Therefore, the meeting was temporarily changed to the Ningbo Road Association. As for the public sacrifice to the former directors, it was decided to be held on March 9th at the North Market Guild Hall on Wenjianshi Road. At that time, all managers of the listed member money shops must attend the public sacrifice, which will be presided over by Qin Runqing and other leaders of the money industry.</p>
<h3>Senior Postal Workers About to be Transferred Out; A Total of 65 People</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Postal Administration has established an office in Shanghai because the Shanghai Postmaster Chapellain (French nationality) also serves as the director and handles postal affairs in the guerrilla area nearby. At the same time, 65 postal workers will be transferred out of Shanghai. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Establish an Office: The Postal Administration has now appointed Shanghai Postal Administration Director Chapellain as the general inspector of the four postal districts of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and will handle postal affairs in the four regions nearby. In order to adapt to the environment, the Postal Administration has established an office in Shanghai (located on the fourth floor of the Administration) due to the successive losses of Guangzhou and Hankou. Chapellain will serve as the director and handle postal affairs in the above-mentioned regions, and has already begun operations.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Transferred Out: According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the number of postal workers to be transferred out recently is 65, with 20 Class A postal workers (not 25) and 45 Class B postal workers (not 40). The transfer locations are Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces (no Changsha). However, according to the postal regulations, only Class A postal workers can be transferred out, and there is no precedent for Class B workers to be transferred out.</p>
<p>No Consent Obtained: It is found that there was a fact of transferring Class B postal workers out last year, but it was done with their consent. This time, it is not the case. At the same time, among the Class B postal workers to be transferred out this time, some are close to 60 years old, and the salaries of the Class B postal workers are mostly less than 100 yuan, so their family life and arrangements are quite difficult. Therefore, most of them are unwilling to be transferred out and consider it a harsh policy. They have already requested the postal authorities to exempt them from the transfer.</p>
<p>Postal Bureau Structure: Although the administrative issue of the Shanghai Postal Bureau has been maintained, after the addition of a Japanese bureau chief assistant, the power has already gone to someone else. The restoration of postal affairs in various guerrilla areas is planned and implemented entirely by the Japanese chief inspector. The Chinese inspectors are only filling the ranks. Okada, a retired Japanese postal worker, has also been re-employed by the Postal Bureau and is serving in Shanghai. The power of the uninvited guest is becoming increasingly evident. The entire postal structure is no longer flawless.</p>
<h3>Local Women Actively Participate in "March 8th" Women's Day, Celebration Suspended Due to National Crisis, Efforts Focus on Rescue Work</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is March 8th, Women's Day. The women's community in this city, given the current national crisis, has suspended celebratory ceremonies. Recognizing that women's liberation is encompassed within national liberation, and that the shackles of the nation must be removed before true liberation is possible, they deeply acknowledge</p>
<p>the current responsibility lies in overcoming the national crisis. They unanimously strive for the national revival and liberation movement, sacrificing personal interests for the greater good, and dedicating themselves to society from their families, seeing this as their undeniable duty. Going forward, the women's community is determined to more actively participate in various social and rescue efforts. Tomorrow, a segment of women plans to visit several shelters on Women's Day to comfort the refugees, and to conduct</p>
<p>planned relief efforts for women and children in distress, fulfilling their responsibility of mutual aid. The "March 8th" Women's Day declaration is recorded as follows: 'Women compatriots from all walks of life, the great "March 8th" Women's Day has arrived again. "March 8th" is a day to commemorate women's solidarity and struggle,</p>
<p>resisting oppression. Our women compatriots, in this era of brutal enemy invasion and sacred resistance, should rise up enthusiastically to commemorate this great Women's Day. Our women compatriots must know that women's liberation and national liberation are inseparable. The national resistance against enemy invasion is also a struggle for women's liberation. This meaning should be deeply understood by women compatriots from all walks of life after this war of resistance. Now, "Resistance and Nation-Building" has entered</p>
<p>the second phase, which is, as Chairman Chiang said, "the period of turning defeat into victory, turning defense into offense, and striving for final victory." Our women compatriots should work even harder, each doing their best and exerting their utmost strength to strengthen the forces of resistance and strive for final victory. In the past, our women compatriots have either bravely fought at the front lines or diligently served in the rear, making significant contributions to the nation. However, this is not yet widespread and deeply rooted, and is far from</p>
<p>fulfilling one's duty. Although Shanghai is in an "isolated island" situation, there are many examples of serving the nation and saving the country. I hope that our women compatriots from all walks of life will firmly believe in the final victory of the War of Resistance, loyally support the sole national leader, Chairman Chiang, and actively develop various national salvation efforts. The so-called national salvation work is not only to strictly implement the movement of non-cooperation with the enemy, but also to actively carry out the movement of donating money and aiding those in distress. In addition, the solidarity and self-cultivation of women themselves, the promotion of children's education, etc., are all</p>
<p>urgent tasks for our women compatriots. Before this great commemoration of "March 8th" Women's Day, may women compatriots from all walks of life become more energized and work hard to oppose the enemy's invasion, fight for the final victory of the War of Resistance, and strive for women's liberation.'</p>
<h3>Passenger Arrests on the Feikang Ship: Protests Remain Unanswered; Japanese Arrogance is Unexpected; German Consulate May Take Strong Measures</h3>
<p>The German merchant Lulin &amp; Co.'s Feikang steamer was stopped and searched by a Japanese warship outside Wusongkou on the morning of the 24th of last month while sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou. Four Chinese passengers were arrested. The German captain, Kebei, telegraphed the company to report the situation to the German Consulate in Shanghai, requesting intervention. The Consulate immediately lodged verbal protests. The Japanese side falsely claimed that the four men were suspected of something and needed to be investigated, so they would not be released. Subsequently, the German Consulate formally submitted a written protest, but the Japanese side did not reply. According to a modern news agency reporter who inquired with relevant parties, as of yesterday, the Japanese side had not responded to the German Consulate's protest, and the four arrested passengers had not been released. The German side was surprised by the Japanese side's tough and arrogant attitude. It is rumored that the German Consulate may take stronger measures to protect the interests of German merchants in China.</p>
<h3>Japanese to Blockade Northern Jiangsu Ports, Monopolize Yangtze River Shipping; Only Eight Ports Open from Haimen to Yangzhou; Nisshin Kisen Kaisha to Add Merchant Ships; Foreign Shipping Companies Request Consular Protests</h3>
<p>The Japanese attempt to control Yangtze River shipping has become increasingly aggressive. Citing military reasons, they will blockade ports in northern Jiangsu from the 10th of this month. The authorities of various foreign shipping companies, regarding this move by the Japanese as a complete monopoly of operations and a deprivation of foreign business rights, have separately presented detailed reports to their respective consuls in Shanghai, lodging serious protests. A modern news agency reporter has investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Regulations for Ship Berthing Ports</p>
<p>The Japanese military authorities have recently accepted Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's request to implement control over shipping on the lower Yangtze River. It has been decided to start with the northern Jiangsu line. From March 10th, only eight ports, including Qinglong Port (Haimen), Tiansheng Port (Nantong), Xinsheng Port, Zhanghuang Port (Rugao), Xin Port (Jingjiang), Tianxing Bridge, Xuan (Xu'an) Bank (Taixing), and Huo Family Bridge (Yangzhou), will be designated for ship berthing and open. All other ports will be blockaded, citing military reasons. The above eight ports will be served by additional ships from Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and a Yangtze River patrol team will be organized by the Japanese Navy to protect cargo transport at all times.</p>
<p>Nisshin Kisen Monopolizes and Increases Ship Services</p>
<p>In addition to completely monopolizing shipping on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River blockade line, refusing foreign merchant operations, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha is also actively competing for shipping on the lower Yangtze River ports in order to seize and monopolize all commercial shipping along the river. From February 25th, the company has transferred five merchant ships from the Shanghai-Wuhu-Hankou route to operate in Tong (Zhou), Ru (Gao), and Jing (Jiang) ports in the lower reaches. In addition, four new types of merchant ships, ranging in tonnage from 2,000 to 3,500 tons, have been added and allocated to operate in various ports. Transport companies have been established in Shanghai and inland areas to specifically handle cargo transport for Japanese ships. The freight rates remain the same as those of other ships. However, after foreign shipping businesses are overthrown in the future, new rates will inevitably be set and freight rates will undoubtedly be increased.</p>
<p>Foreign Companies Request Protests</p>
<p>After the news that the Japanese planned to blockade ports along the river on the 10th of this month spread, foreign shipping companies such as British, Italian, German, and Portuguese became extremely alarmed, believing that this move was clearly monopolizing shipping and encroaching on the rights and interests of various countries in China. Although the Japanese side has not yet issued any formal announcement or written notice, the date of the blockade is approaching. Therefore, they have separately presented detailed reports to the consuls of various countries in Shanghai, describing the advantages, disadvantages, and current situation of each port, requesting serious protests.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Cotton to be Purchased by the Farmers Bank as Much as Possible; Running Counter to the Ministry of Finance's Prohibition, While Considering Farmers' Livelihoods</h3>
<p>Previously, the cotton stored in eastern Zhejiang was approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to be released by various customs houses upon certification by the Chamber of Commerce and transported to the Shanghai concessions for use by various yarn factories. The United Association of Chinese Yarn Factories in this city and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have complied with the order. Now, the Ministry of Finance, considering cotton as a military raw material, has reiterated the prohibition. All cotton stored in eastern Zhejiang is to be purchased by the Farmers Bank as much as possible, as instructed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to maintain the livelihood of farmers.</p>
<h3>Japan's Monetary Policy in North China Fails (Part 1); Results in Sacrificing Bank of Japan Notes; North China's Public Faith in Legal Tender is Extremely Strong; Testimony by Japanese National Tsuchizo Mito</h3>
<p>The Continental News Agency reports that the March issue of "Modern Japan" contains an article by Tsuchizo Mito discussing the monetary situation in the Japanese-controlled areas of China and Japan's monetary actions. The article contains astonishing revelations, such as that the counterfeit banknotes of Peiping already circulating in North China, except for a small amount of 13 million yuan, were all used to pay for Japan's military expenses, and were not issued to simultaneously recover Chinese legal tender. The article also reveals that Japan's "military scrip" was also used to pay for military expenses and purchase legal tender, and then the legal tender was used to purchase Chinese goods that could not be obtained with Japanese currency or counterfeit currency. Mito also explicitly stated that the Peiping counterfeit banknotes were not worth the officially fixed price of one shilling and two pence, which was equivalent to the Japanese yen. Mito's article clearly shows that he considers the entire monetary experiment in Peiping to be a monetary failure. Finally, he observed the strength of Chinese legal tender and the trust of the people of North China in legal tender, which is rare among the Japanese. An excerpt from Tsuchizo Mito's article in "Modern Japan" is as follows:</p>
<p>When the war began, no one expected its scale to develop to its current magnitude, so it was decided to use Bank of Korea notes to pay for military expenses. However, the expansion of the war zone exceeded expectations, making it impossible to continue using these notes, otherwise, the Bank of Japan notes would be subjected to an undesired heavy burden, as will be described below. This situation led to the establishment of a new bank in North China to issue banknotes. Initially, it was planned to use the Hebei Provincial Bank as the core to form a new bank, but it was immediately recognized that these compensatory plans were all inappropriate. The first step must be to adjust the banknotes previously issued by various banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Jidong Bank, in order to place the monetary system on a solid and unified foundation. Therefore, the proposed</p>
<p>bank to issue banknotes was established, named the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China," with an approved capital of 50 million Japanese yen, half of the capital fully paid up, of which 12.5 million yen was paid by the "Provisional Government." The eight Chinese banks in North China, such as the Hebei Provincial Bank, Jidong Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Jincheng Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, jointly contributed 12.5 million yen. Japanese banks also provided credit loans of 100 million Japanese yen, greatly enhancing the new bank's resources. However, difficulties arose because the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications refused to hand over the silver held as the new bank's reserve, which was stored in the British and French concessions. This silver accounted for a large portion of the "Joint Reserve Bank's" silver reserve of 58 million yuan. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Wu Wenzhong Attempts to Seize the Puppet District Court</h3>
<p>Wu Wenzhong, the puppet director of the Social Affairs Bureau and concurrent director of the Judicial Department, is attempting to seize the puppet District Court and expand it into an independent judicial organ. This matter is currently underway in secret.</p>

<h3>Unable to Do Evil in Shanghai, Chang Yuqing Flees to Nanjing; How to Account for 100,000 Yuan? Will Face Complaints from "Master"</h3>
<p>The veteran traitor Chang Yuqing, after failing to organize the assassination organization "Huangdao Society" for his "master," secretly went to Nanjing to reorganize the "Anqing Alliance." Since the successive incidents of eliminating traitors in the two Shanghai concessions a few days ago, Chang immediately boasted to his "master" Harada (a senior advisor to the puppet Restoration Government) that he was willing to come to Shanghai to lead the work of clearing out "terrorists." Harada approved his request and allocated 100,000 yuan as activity expenses. After receiving the money, Chang secretly came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 27th of last month and hid in his private residence on Laobazi Road in Hongkou. Apart from ordering a few of his lackeys to spread rumors in the two concessions, he did nothing. Moreover, the authorities of the two concessions, after receiving secret reports that Chang had secretly come to Shanghai to plot evil deeds, had already taken precautions and were actively investigating his whereabouts to prevent trouble. Seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, Chang secretly fled to Nanjing again yesterday. However, how to explain to his "master" Harada is a big problem, because Chang only spent a few thousand yuan of the huge activity fund of 100,000 yuan, and the rest was pocketed. It is expected that Chang will be reprimanded by his "master" this time and will have to vomit out the money.</p>
<h3>Garrison Organizes Jiaojiang Waterway, Prepares to Resume Shipping; Most Foreign Ships Have Registered as Ordered; Golden Meda Prepares for Test Run</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army attempted to land at Haimen, Zhejiang, Jiaojiang has been blockaded and shipping has been cut off. Now that order has been restored in Haimen, the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has agreed to the shipping merchants' request to re-register and prepare to resume shipping from March 1st. The shipping merchants have complied with the order, and the obstacles in Jiaojiang have been removed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Ship Registration</p>
<p>Foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Taizhou-Wenzhou-Ningbo-Xiangshan-Dinghai routes have all complied with the order to apply for re-registration and have completed all procedures with the Maritime Affairs Office directly under the Ministry of Communications. These include Ninghai, New Beijing, Yongtai, Golden, Delong, Ende, Deping, Meda, Meili, Fade, Tanglu, Hailake, Yongfu, Guangsheng, Yongsheng, Tangsai, New Xiangtai, Yongzhen, Chengdu, Zhejiang, Yongda, Xiang'an, Hana, Fusheng, Tangbei, Haifu, New Anna, Hengsheng, Anna, Minhe, Anding, Yongli, Chengfeng, etc.</p>
<p>Waterway Organization</p>
<p>Obstacles in Jiaojiang, Haimen, have been removed by the garrison. A waterway has been left on the blockade line for ships to pass through. The blockade line created by the Japanese army in Jiaojiang has been destroyed. Once the re-registration of ships is completed and the Jiaojiang waterway is organized, shipping to Haimen will be resumed. The Golden Line, represented by the German merchant Lulin &amp; Co., will sail from Ningbo to Taizhou, and the Meda ship of the Portuguese merchant Meili Company will sail from Shanghai to Taizhou. Both have telegraphed the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander for instructions. Once the reply is approved, shipping to Haimen will be resumed.</p>
<p>Continuing Navigation to Wenzhou and Ningbo</p>
<p>The foreign ships that were previously approved to operate to Haimen were approved by the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo Defense Commanders to change their routes to Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo after the Haimen Jiaojiang blockade. Initially, the operation was limited to one voyage. After requesting accommodation, they were specially approved to operate on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo routes on a regular basis until Haimen is reopened. The Hana ship sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday, and the Shantao ship will sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow. The foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou and Ningbo are mainly loaded with native products from the interior to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Foreign Business Cooperates in Donating Funds to Relieve Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi; Formulates Second Phase Plan; Organizes Received Donations</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Townsmen Relief of Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi Fundraising Committee in Shanghai has received more than 140,000 yuan in national currency as of recently. 40,000 Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to more than 72,600 yuan in national currency) have been remitted to the committee's representatives in Hong Kong, Lin Bingyan and others, for proper distribution and relief. They are currently investigating the situation of those in need of rescue in the disaster areas and will continue to remit funds to provide relief. The committee believes that the disaster areas in Guangdong and Guangxi are vast, and there are many refugees in need of urgent assistance. It is necessary to step up fundraising efforts to provide widespread relief. All donations received so far have been organized, and the first report will be printed and distributed to all sectors for review. Cui Pinxi, director of the design department, has formulated a second-phase implementation plan, which has been submitted to the Standing Committee for approval and implementation. Foreign businesses in this city have also been actively donating. Jardine Matheson has automatically donated 5,000 yuan in national currency and has promised to donate another 5,000 yuan. Mr. Keswick, manager of Jardine Matheson, has also promised to donate 6,000 yuan in national currency. Their generosity is commendable. The committee is scheduled to hold its seventh Standing Committee meeting at 5:00 pm today (7th) at Feng's residence on Dunxin Road. Chairman Feng Bingnan has issued a meeting notice.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Establishes a "Special Tax Office"</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance of the puppet Restoration Government will organize a "Special Tax Office" in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to control the transportation and sale of opium, morphine, heroin, etc. Gu Guiyu, secretary of the ministry, is attempting to seize this position.</p>
<h3>Depreciation of Legal Tender in North China Backfires; Legal Tender Can Exchange for Counterfeit Currency with Increased Premium in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Continental News Agency reports that since February 20th, the Peiping puppet "Provisional Government" has nominally implemented the exchange of legal tender for Peiping counterfeit currency in North China, depreciating it by 40%. In Tianjin, it has remained unaffected. During the last week of last month, the premium for exchanging legal tender for counterfeit currency in Tianjin surged to 2.5 to 3.5 per mille. This news was published in the North China Star in Tianjin. The report also stated that at the time of the nominal abandonment of legal tender in North China, the area will control the export of foreign exchange from the 11th of this month. This move is currently forcing exporters to transport any existing goods from Tianjin to overseas.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Defense Department Discusses Resuming Shanghai-Dinghai Fish Transport; Headquarters Has Forwarded to Higher Authorities for Instructions; Enemy-Collaborating Criminal in Haimen Apprehended in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, after the Dinghai fish merchants requested to hire ships to transport fish, the Ningbo Defense Department drafted a plan and submitted it to the headquarters for approval. It is learned that the × Group Army Headquarters has forwarded it to the highest authorities for instructions. It can only be implemented after approval. According to news from the shipping industry, when Japanese warships harassed Haimen, Zhejiang, there were traitors who collaborated with the enemy and set fire. One person named Jin Haoyou escaped to Ningbo and was apprehended a few days ago. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai Still Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Dinghai route was cut off after the Ningbo military authorities ordered the ships on the Shanghai-Taizhou route not to also call at Dinghai. Repeated requests have been made by various parties to resume it, but they have not been approved. Subsequently, the Dinghai fish merchants stated that the suspension of Shanghai ships has made it impossible to transport and sell all the fresh fish, which is of great importance to the livelihood of the fishermen. Therefore, they submitted a detailed report stating the reasons and requested instructions from the Ningbo Defense Commander. Commander Guo also considered the relief of the fishing industry to be a matter of urgency and convened a meeting a few days ago with representatives from Dinghai fish merchants and relevant agencies. Four fish transport measures were drafted and forwarded to the × Group Army Headquarters for review. It is learned that the headquarters, after receiving the report, heard that the original measures have been telegraphed to the higher military authorities for instructions.

<p>Enemy-Collaborating Criminal in Haimen Apprehended in Ningbo</p>
<p>Since the 17th of last month, the Haimen port in Zhejiang has been repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships. Local bandits also set fire to the interior, causing chaos. Subsequently, the defending troops bravely defended and repelled the Japanese warships and suppressed the banditry. According to reliable information from the shipping industry, a Haimen traitor named Jin Haoyou was shot in the mouth by the defending troops during the suppression and fled to Ningbo to seek treatment at the Huamei Hospital in Beimen. This was discovered by the foreign water police, who telegraphed the Ningbo Police Bureau on the 3rd night to investigate and arrest him. After receiving the telegram, Director Yu immediately dispatched officers to secretly investigate. The bandit Jin Haoyou was arrested at Huamei Hospital and taken to the bureau for interrogation. The bandit confessed to setting fire and collaborating with the enemy, attempting to lure the enemy to land. The bureau then summoned Wu Jinbao, the guarantor who admitted the bandit to the hospital, and sent them both into custody pending further action. The Water Police Bureau was also notified by telegram.</p>

<h3>Our Government and HSBC Stabilize the Shanghai Black Market Exchange Rate; After Consideration, China Has Special Circumstances; It is Not Easy to Ban Due to Extraterritoriality and Other Reasons</h3>
<p>After our government controlled foreign exchange, the Central Bank supplied legal foreign exchange for the import of essential goods. For the export of major native products, foreign exchange was sold to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications according to law. The import of luxury and consumer goods was not supplied with legal foreign exchange. Therefore, merchants engaged in luxury goods and consumer goods could not apply for foreign exchange themselves and turned to foreign banks to purchase it. The black market for foreign exchange arose. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly considered the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai, believing that the black market for foreign exchange is not unique to China and exists in all countries in the world. However, China's black market has its special circumstances and is more difficult to ban. The reasons are: (1) China has concessions; (2) it has extraterritoriality; (3) it has remittances from overseas Chinese. Because remittances from overseas Chinese are small and scattered, our country has not established banks extensively overseas, so many remittances have always been controlled by foreign banks. Therefore, foreign exchange is not easy to control. Secondly, there are concessions and extraterritoriality, and the power of many local governments cannot reach them, so it is impossible to ban them. It cannot be done by a government order. In order to stabilize the black market exchange rate, we have cooperated with HSBC. Therefore, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai will not fluctuate significantly in the future. The Central Bank will continue to handle the supply of legal foreign exchange in accordance with the procedures promulgated by the government.</p>
<h3>Terrorists Go to Peiping to Operate; Wang Kemin Narrowly Escapes Assassination</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that a large number of terrorists have reportedly arrived in Peiping from Tianjin. On the evening of Friday, the 5th, they attempted to enter the "Provisional Government" office. They were all dressed in plain clothes and exchanged fire with the puppet soldiers guarding the gate of the puppet government before leaving. They also attempted to assassinate Wang Kemin, the Executive Yuan President of the puppet "Provisional Government," and other senior officials of the puppet regime. The editor of the "Wude Bao" (transliteration), a Japanese newspaper published by the Japanese army, who is Chinese, was also visited by two plainclothes men. The Japanese army is now taking special precautions to prevent the activities of plainclothes Chinese.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Shanghai's Eastern District Arrest Five Chinese Yesterday; Yulin Road Police Station Sent Personnel to Negotiate; Misunderstanding Resolved Quickly</h3>
<p>Around 1 PM yesterday, an incident occurred on Yenshan Road within the jurisdiction of the Yulin Road Police Station in the Eastern District of the Public Concession, involving the arrest of five Chinese individuals by the Japanese Naval Intelligence. Subsequent investigation revealed that the arrests were a direct action by the Japanese military. As a result, the police station only learned of the incident after reports from the families of the arrested. Considering this action to be in violation of cooperative principles, they immediately initiated negotiations to inquire about the reasons for the arrests. According to the Japanese side, the individuals were identified as anti-Japanese terrorists and were therefore arrested. However, no supporting evidence was presented. Consequently, the district chief of the police station dispatched Western Inspector Robertson to Hongkou to specifically interview the Japanese military authorities. Based on cooperative principles, they requested the release of the five Chinese individuals or their transfer to the police station for investigation. If no evidence could be presented, they should be immediately released in accordance with the original agreement. However, the Japanese military authorities did not agree to this request, and even created difficulties for Robertson. Fortunately, Chief Inspector Childe and the district chief were informed of the situation and urgently invited the Japanese military authorities to exchange opinions at the Yulin Road Police Station. The misunderstanding was resolved around 6 PM. The five Chinese individuals were still detained at the Japanese headquarters because the Japanese insisted on further investigation. Negotiations are currently ongoing. At the time of the Japanese officers' meeting at the police station, a large number of marine corps soldiers were deployed around the Yulin Road Police Station to maintain guard, which caused external speculation and made the situation appear very serious.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants' Shipping Industry Progresses; Companies Add Ships and Extra Voyages; Another Giant Ship from Italy is Coming</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese shipping companies feared interception by the Japanese Navy and automatically suspended all coastal routes. Consequently, foreign merchant ships profited from this situation and facilitated domestic transportation. Therefore, during the past period, shipping companies flying foreign flags made considerable profits, and even customs brokers enjoyed significant surpluses. As for the European and American routes, although cargo transportation was affected when the war broke out in the suburbs of Shanghai, many wealthy individuals fled overseas, resulting in a tenfold increase in passenger fares. Hong Kong was a particularly popular destination, and tickets were sometimes difficult to purchase, leading to soaring prices. Therefore, the passenger ticket revenue compensated for the cargo revenue, resulting in no losses in business. In the past year, China's foreign trade has recovered to its former state. Exports of silk, tea, tung oil, leather, and wool have even exceeded pre-war levels. However, imports of foreign goods (excluding Japanese goods) are slightly lower. Nevertheless, in the three months so far this year, cotton imports from India have been substantial, and it is said that they were all purchased by Japanese merchants. The prosperity of the shipping industry during the Sino-Japanese War was unexpected. Shipping companies are optimistic and have taken measures to add ships and extra voyages. The British company's newly built "Guangdong" ship, with a deadweight of over 17,000 tons, arrived in Shanghai last November and joined the shipping routes. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai for the third time and is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow. Furthermore, it is learned that the Italian Postal Shipping Company's four postal ships: "Conte Rosso," "Conte Verde," "Conte Biancamano," and "Vittoria," are known for their speed. It only takes 23 days to travel from Shanghai to Genoa. Recently, it was learned that the company has a new ship, "Giulio Cesare," coming to Shanghai. The ship originally operated between Italy and North Africa and has a displacement of 27,500 tons. The interior is equipped with the latest facilities. Because it used to sail in the tropics, the ship only has first and second class seats, with no third class. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai for a trial voyage on May 16th this year.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Brings More Jewish Refugees; Totaling 450 People</h3>
<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," 450 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria arrived on the Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso" yesterday (the 5th) afternoon. Currently, the total number of Jewish refugees in Shanghai has exceeded 4,000. A large number of staff from the committee caring for new refugees waited at the customs pier to assist them through routine customs procedures, as before. A large number of trucks arrived at the entrance to transport luggage. It is said that those arriving yesterday will be housed in the Riverside Mansion, as part of the mansion is used by the refugee committee. As for some single men, they will be placed in the new apartment on Ward Road, which opened some time ago and can accommodate 1,200 people. It is expected that several more refugees will arrive in Shanghai in the coming months, estimated to reach as many as 6,000. According to various sources, they have already booked tickets to the Far East, mostly to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Cao Jiazhen Abducted; Entire Family of Abductors Arrested; Abductor Leader Lin Xucen and Cao are Fellow Townsmen and Classmates; Old Father Delivers Letter to Lure Cao into Trap; Sister Watches Over Hostage; Interrogation Denies Abduction, Claiming Purpose was to Borrow Money for Subsistence</h3>
<p>Qiu Youxin, a former chief writer for the "Shanghai Shangbao" and "Jiangnan Wanbao," and former magistrate of Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, now residing on the second floor of 442 Fulili Road in the French Concession, is the uncle of Cao Jiazhen. Cao Jiazhen, 27 years old, is from the same hometown as Qiu. His father, Cao Rong, who is now deceased, ran a money exchange business and owned real estate worth nearly 20,000 gold in his hometown. Cao's mother lives in Ningbo. Since the August 13th Incident, Cao welcomed his mother, wife, and sister to Shanghai to seek refuge. They rent a residence at No. 488 Jianye Lane, Fulili Road. Cao is currently employed at the Datong Shipping Company, Room 207, Guangdong Bank Building, Jiangxi Road, Ningbo Road, and goes to the company to work every day, leaving in the morning and returning at night. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, Cao left his residence to go to the Datong Company to work. He went missing that night and did not return. In the afternoon of the same day, his uncle, Qiu Youxin, reported to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation into Cao's whereabouts. By 9:00 AM on the 3rd, there was still no news. While Cao's mother, wife, and sister were in a state of anxiety, a letter was suddenly delivered to the Chunmao Cigarette Paper Shop downstairs at 42 Fulili Road, Jia Lane, Qiu Youxin's residence, instructing them to forward it to the family of Cao Jiazhen.</p>
<p>Upon opening the letter, it was found to be signed by He Hongda, the leader of the Labor Iron Blood Corps. The letter stated that due to a shortage of funds, Cao Jiazhen had been abducted and a ransom of 10,000 yuan was demanded for his release. The letter specified that contact should be made between 3:00 PM and 10:00 PM on the 4th at the telephone installed at the home of Feng Bozhun, Cao Jiazhen's cousin-in-law, at No. 70 Changyun Lane, Xindagu Road. Qiu then reported the information to the French Police Station, and Inspectors Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, along with detectives Shen Jinshu, Jin Bingwen, Zhong Benchang, and Tao Ronglin, began the investigation.</p>
<p>Following the instructions in the letter, Qiu Youxin contacted the abductors by telephone at 6:00 PM on the 4th and negotiated a ransom of 1,000 yuan. They were instructed to place 1,000 yuan in cash inside a ten-pound biscuit tin and have someone sent by the abductors to collect it from the Chunmao Cigarette Paper Shop at 442 Fulili Road at 8:30 AM on the 5th. They were instructed not to tell the person delivering the biscuit tin that it contained money.</p>
<p>They informed the police station and detectives Shen Jinshu, Zhong Benchang, Tao Ronglin, Yang Jiaxue, Jiang Zhongjia, Wu Helin, and Chen Fusheng disguised themselves and waited. As expected, at 8:00 AM on the 5th, someone arrived at the Chunmao Cigarette Paper Shop at 442 Fulili Road with a note to collect the biscuit tin. The detectives arrested him and took him to the police station. Under interrogation, the man confessed that his name was</p>
<p>Ni Fusheng, 17 years old, from Pinghu. He worked as a tea server at the Danghu Hotel in Lane 9, Shanxi Road (i.e., Huajin Lane). He said that a guest in Room 21 had asked him to pick up the biscuit tin and he was unaware of the details. The detectives followed Ni to the Danghu Hotel and arrested Lin Xucen (29 years old, from Cixi) in Room 21. Lin confessed to planning the abduction of Cao Jiazhen for ransom. The hostage was hidden in the two-story attic residence inside the Yangjian Elementary School at No. 9, Lane 1216, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Massenet. He said that he and the abductee were</p>
<p>Fellow townsmen and classmates. Due to unemployment and financial difficulties, he resorted to this desperate measure. The detectives took Lin to the Public Concession Police Station and requested that detectives be dispatched to the address to rescue the hostage, Cao Jiazhen. Lin's father, Lin Jinyou (65 years old), and Lin's sister, Gen Maoren (37 years old), were found guarding the hostage. Two daggers were confiscated. When Lin Maoren was arrested, she was dressed as a man. The attic where the hostage was hidden was covered with black paper to block out light. According to the main suspect</p>
<p>Lin Xucen's confession, there were accomplices including his younger brother, Lin Xuxing (27 years old), who was staying in Room 3 at the Jiangxin Hotel, No. 40 Shanxi Road. They were all taken back to the French Police Station. It was found that the main suspect, Lin Xucen, had impersonated Cao's friend Chen Guangfu and written a note, which he entrusted to his father, Lin Jinyou, to take to the Datong Company, luring Cao Jiazhen to Room 429, Asia Hotel, Avenue Edward VII. Lin Jinyou was in</p>
<p>The Asia Hotel</p>
<p>waiting in the room. When Cao arrived, Lin Jinyou claimed that Chen Guangfu could not wait and had returned to his residence. He asked Lin Jinyou to accompany Cao to his residence to meet him. After Cao went to the Asia Hotel, Lin Jinyou led Cao to their residence, where he was confined. Lin Xucen then wrote a letter to Cao demanding a ransom. Yesterday afternoon, the police station transferred the four members of the Lin family, father, son, daughter, and brother, to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case and requested a postponement</p>
<p>For investigation before prosecution. Detective Zhong Benjing then reported the details of the case and the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. The victim, Cao Jiazhen, also recounted the details of his abduction and confinement. Lin Xucen confessed that he used to run a cosmetics business, but the store was destroyed by the war and he became unemployed. He was unable to find work, ran out of money, and was suffering from poverty and illness, leaving him with no choice but to resort to this desperate measure. Lin Jinyou, Lin Xuxing, and Lin Maoren all denied knowing about or participating in the conspiracy. Judge Zhang Minsheng verified the confessions and ruled that the hearing would be postponed for fifteen days. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Daughter-in-Law Forced to Cut Flesh from Thigh to Cure Husband; Leading to Death; Obstinate Mother-in-Law Mistreats Her in Every Way; Young Woman Commits Suicide in Despair</h3>
<p>Zhan Honglin, a large silk and flower merchant from Fujian, is over fifty years old. He used to run the Jufengtai Silk and Flower Company. During the August 13th Incident, Zhan made a considerable profit. At that time, he purchased the residence at No. 7, Lane 274, Chengdu Road, formerly the residence of Lu Shaotang, for a large sum of money. After extensive renovations, he moved to that location, and all of his sons, daughters-in-law, etc., also lived there with him.</p>
<p>Servants and maids were employed, and the lifestyle was quite comfortable. However, his wife, Zhang, was an old-fashioned woman with a stubborn mind. Because she had no children of her own, she adopted four children. Her eldest son, Xin Xian, married a woman surnamed Ji. After a long time, she could not bear the mistreatment of her mother-in-law, Zhang, and her husband, Xin Xian, was also dissolute. Consequently, in 1937, she committed suicide by swallowing opium out of resentment.</p>
<p>This spring, the mother-in-law continued to marry off the son to Shi Rend, the third daughter of Shi Liufang, the owner of Zhaofang Photo Studio (25 years old). After the marriage, it was initially harmonious, but the old nature of the mother-in-law, Zhang, did not change. Because Xin Xian suffered from tuberculosis, she instructed Shi Rend to take care of him in every way, in addition to serving medicine. The mistreatment of Shi became even more severe. Soon, she had an absurd idea and forced Shi</p>
<p>To cut flesh from her thigh to cure her son's lung disease. She urged and nagged her day and night. Shi felt that the family was so dark, and her husband was like a stranger. On February 13th, she returned to her hometown in Ningbo to visit her parents, intending to tell them her grievances. However, she happened to encounter her father's illness and silently returned. But the mother-in-law's pressure started again. At that time, Shi</p>
<p>Was heartbroken. At 10 PM that night, she was writing a letter at her desk, and then pretended to sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 12 AM, the maid found that Shi's complexion was unusual. Before she could ask, Shi was already in a coma. Her husband, Xin Xian, did not ask or hear, and ignored it. It was not until the poison took effect and she cried out that the family sent her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After examination, it was found that she had swallowed Lysol. However, it was too late, and the poisoning was too severe, so that</p>
<p>There was no way to save her. She died at 2 AM on the 14th. Her body has been examined by the court. However, Shi's father, Liufang, said that although his daughter's suicide was self-inflicted, the reason for her death was purely because she was forced by a dark family and sacrificed herself. Moreover, his daughter had a suicide note at the time, so why did it disappear after her death? This is very important. Moreover, there are various rumors outside, and he is eager to clear her name. He is currently secretly investigating, and the public is also paying close attention. It is expected that this case will eventually come to light.</p>

<p>Zhong Huili, a Shaoxing woman (27 years old), is said to have been a dance girl at the International Ballroom. Later, she married Yu Renqing, a Shaoxing fur merchant, and lived with him at 177 Guizhou Road. However, Yu often traveled between Shanghai and Shaoxing for business. In January of this year, Zhong suddenly rented a room at 560 Zhongnan Hotel, Avenue Edward VII. At the same time, a Shaoxing man named Guan Maotou (also known as Xiaomaotou), 24 years old, was inseparable from her. They often went in and out of gambling dens and dance halls in western Shanghai. Suddenly, Zhong reported to the Laozha Police Station, claiming that a suitcase containing clothes worth more than a thousand yuan, which she had placed in her room at the Zhongnan Hotel, had been stolen by Guan. After investigation by Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan, Guan was finally arrested yesterday in Room 335 of the Zhongnan Hotel and taken back to the police station. Guan admitted to taking the woman's suitcase to pawn it, but claimed that he and the woman had an affair. He said that this time, they went to a gambling den in western Shanghai to gamble and lost, and he had no choice but to pawn the clothes. He said that he had done this several times before. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a theft charge, stating that the inside story of the case was complex and needed to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, he requested that a postponement be granted for further investigation. After Judge Fang Qinghuan questioned both parties, he ordered Guan to be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed.</p>
<h3>Assassination Attempt on Zhu Ganting, Fake "Nanhui Tax Director," Fails; Two Strong Men Open Fire on Zhu But Miss; Zhu's Wife is Skilled in Martial Arts and Escapes Death; Iron Blood Assassination Squad Active in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>At 7:40 AM yesterday, an assassination attempt on Zhu Ganting, a traitorous fake "Nanhui Tax Director," failed in Qingyuli, Kangnaojiao Road, a road built beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai.

He once served as a company commander during the Northern Warlord era. Later, he served as a senior official in the Food Management Committee of the National Government. After the August 23rd Shanghai Incident, Zhu betrayed the country and joined the Su Xiweng department of the fake "Da Dao Municipal Government," serving as an official in the "Finance Bureau." Later, he was sent to western Shanghai as the tax director, and recently he was sent to the fake "Nanhui County Tax Director." Zhu has been in fake positions for more than a year, extorting a lot of evil money. He currently lives on the third floor of No. 25 Qingyuli, Kangnaotuo Road, a road built beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai. Strong Men Come to Open Fire But Miss; At around 7:40 AM yesterday, Zhu was still asleep at home when two strong men suddenly came to visit Zhu, one wearing a suit and the other wearing a robe. After meeting, the two strong men took out an appointment letter-style envelope, which read "Zhu Ganting is willing to be a traitor and should be executed immediately," followed by the words "Youth Iron Blood Assassination Squad." After reading the letter, Zhu tried to deny it. At that time, one of the strong men took out a pistol from his sleeve and tried to shoot Zhu. At that time, Zhu's daughter entered the room from outside. She was skilled in martial arts and, seeing this situation, quickly stepped forward and hugged the strong man. Zhu was also extremely frightened and quickly wrapped a quilt around himself and jumped off the bed. Another strong man pulled out his gun and fired a shot, but missed. Zhu's daughter then shouted for help. The two strong men calmly left, saying as they left, "We'll let you live a few more days and come back to execute you." After the incident, Zhu was frightened and, according to reports, has fled to Hongkou by car. (Shewen News Agency)</p>

<h3>On the Necessary Care for Men's Bodies, Starting from Artificial Sex Transformation</h3>
<p>Modern science is truly advancing by leaps and bounds; almost any difficult problem can be solved by science. We can never fully recount the great achievements in the field of natural science. The research on human reproductive glands in physiology alone is astonishing! Dr. Steinach dedicated his life's experience to arduous experiments on human reproductive glands. As a result, he successfully supplemented the human body with animal glandular extracts, achieving the effects of curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating the body. This shocked the medical world and benefited human health. His great achievements shine as brightly as the sun and moon. However, regarding the study of reproductive glands, Dr. William O. Puckett recently demonstrated his artificial sex transformation method at the American Zoological Society. He dissected the reproductive glands of very young tadpoles for public observation, pointing out that the sex of tadpoles is not yet determined at this stage. Their sex differentiation usually occurs in the late stage of tadpole development. At this time, if either female or male endocrine secretions (gonadal fluid) are injected together with the mucus gland in a small organ behind the tadpole's skull, tadpoles that prefer female endocrine secretions will become female, while those that receive male endocrine secretions will become male. The doctor conducted repeated experiments and could arbitrarily make them female or male. From the success of this experiment, it is not difficult to extend the application to humans. Indeed, after a couple gets married, having sons and daughters in their married life is closely related to sexual health. A vigorous and healthy husband is more likely to have sons soon after the wedding. Furthermore, if a man takes care of his reproductive gland fluid with various hygienic methods to keep it abundant, he can often have sons. There is truth to the saying "a pure heart and few desires lead to many sons!" However, if a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or indulges in excessive sexual activity after marriage, leading to the loss of control over his semen, weakening of the sexual nerves, and resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipated energy, deficiency of the brain and kidneys, forgetfulness, and insomnia, he will often be unable to have a fulfilling married life. In this case, not only is it difficult to have children, but the marital relationship may also be difficult to maintain. Therefore, various tragedies often occur in families, or wives even confidently file for divorce from their husbands, which is common in today's society. As for the man himself, he suffers from physical weakness and experiences such misery, which is unbearable! Due to the pain within, the illness worsens, leading to premature aging or early death. How dangerous this is! Although there are many treatment methods, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, it is generally recognized that taking the glandular extract preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. Indeed, this agent can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate the blood within one day and night after taking it, making the man full of energy and intensifying the couple's love. Having sons and daughters becomes more assured. If continued, it can not only completely cure various male sexual dysfunctions but also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating the body. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Tablets) to consolidate the semen and stop leakage for even faster results! If patients can come to our clinic and receive scientific therapies such as diagnosis by expert doctors, electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Common Ailments of Youth</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Harms of Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Diseases Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, crossroads are everywhere, and inexperienced young people are wandering astray, truly facing dangers at every turn. The greatest forces that tempt young people are glamorous women and self-sexual stimulation because young people are at the stage of budding feelings and intense sexual curiosity. At this time, without good education and proper guidance, few are not lured by negative environments and fall into the abyss of filth. Taking the most common masturbation and nocturnal emission among young people, which are often ignored by society, the severity of their harm is even worse than floods and wild beasts! First, the number of young people who commit masturbation is countless. Those who truly suffer are those whose sexual nerves are damaged, leading to loss of control over the semen and hypersensitivity of ejaculation, which is followed by nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission starts, it is like having a leaky vessel, and a large amount of semen is inevitably lost from the body, causing all parts of the body to be in a state of depletion. Various symptoms of weakness, such as brain atrophy, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, and kidney deficiency, then follow. Their personal health and future happiness are then in the darkness of a confused night. Second, due to the damage to sexual function, they will not be able to live a fulfilling sexual life after marriage. As a result, the wife's youth is wasted, and happiness is ruined, as if the wife has been sent into a tomb of pain. At the same time, what about the happiness that he himself should have in life? It is unknown whether it will be thrown into a fog or beyond the clouds. Third, from childhood to youth, the burdens and cultivation given by their parents, elder siblings, teachers, and society and the nation are by no means few. In terms of the family, they hope to establish a family and glorify their ancestors. In terms of society and the nation, they hope that they can become a construction technician and a loyal and brave soldier on the battlefield to gain a capable member in the journey of resisting aggression and building the nation. However, can they actually meet this requirement? As far as we know, most young people are sinking into the low-level interests of masturbation and debauchery and cannot extricate themselves. How can we not sigh! Aware youth, at this once-in-a-lifetime moment, at the juncture of human enslavement, we must use the greatest determination to resolve our masturbation and debauchery and take the most effective good medicine, "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Tablets), to consolidate the semen, relieve the state of ejaculation hypersensitivity, and fundamentally treat nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, it is even more necessary to take the glandular extract preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood, so that health can be completely restored in a short period.</p>
<h3>The Value of Breasts in Love</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>High and elastic breasts are the soul of a healthy and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>A pair of high breasts, setting off a graceful figure, with plump hips, plus a fair and rosy face, with willow eyebrows and cherry lips, pearly teeth, and a beautiful nose, such a healthy and beautiful woman is not only respected like a goddess by her husband at home, and the love between the two sexes is especially strong, but also when she goes out to socialize, with her appearance, she is everywhere like stars surrounding the moon, receiving enthusiastic welcome.</p>
<p>However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in the world. The main reason is that a woman's complete health relies on the full integrity of the ovarian function. With a sound ovarian function, a woman's characteristics, that is, good development, the most obvious is that the breast presents a firm and elastic peak-like bulge. Even if she wears tight clothes, it will not succumb so protrude on the chest, with two peaks facing each other, and a deep valley, which is so intoxicating. At the same time, the hips must also be quite developed, coupled with a lively willow waist, forming the most mysterious and lovely curves of a woman. However, only women with good development can enjoy these qualities. Others who indulged in masturbation in their early years or due to menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, or weakness after illness, which led to impaired ovarian function and affected metabolism, the originally high breasts will also shrink, beauty will be lost, and the complexion will become haggard. Such a woman is not only often disliked by her husband at home and has difficulty conceiving, but also in terms of her personal temperament, she is often narrow-minded, sentimental, and happiness is not related to her. Therefore, the tragedy of her future fate is unimaginable! To seek remedy, one can only rely on science. According to the experience of the world's gynecologists, such as Oansnast Konstan's and others, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation called "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. Therefore, this medicine can nourish the ovaries and increase metabolism immediately after taking it. If continued, it guarantees to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period, making the breasts gradually bulge, transforming ugliness into beauty.</p>

<h3>A New Relief for Diffuse Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>After the venereal poison has been conquered by the newly invented special drug "Da 〇 Liu" (Great 606, referring to Salvarsan), its rampant prevalence is far less than before. The one that has taken its place is gonorrhea. It is not only as prevalent as syphilis used to be but even more so. Because of the pervasiveness of gonorrhea, in many large cities, the number of men suffering from gonorrhea is actually more than the number of healthy men, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, we must thoroughly research the treatment of gonorrhea to rapidly eradicate this raging disease. However, many city doctors who stick to old methods often stubbornly adhere to a certain treatment method, such as using only one type of medicine or one type of surgery to deal with the ever-changing gonorrhea. How can we expect gonorrhea to be cured soon and return happiness to people? Now, doctors with a slightly modern mindset feel that it is imperative to treat gonorrhea, especially to deal with diffuse gonorrhea. Now, let's discuss it separately.</p>
<p>For stubborn and diffuse leukorrhea, the diagnosis and treatment should be studied with the greatest effort. Start with a precise diagnosis to determine whether it belongs to acute or chronic urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, etc., and then use targeted treatment to expect a cure soon. For example, gonorrheal arthritis, orchitis, etc., must be injected with German Hee-Ying serum to eliminate widespread gonorrhea bacteria, while for the initial stage of cystitis, mechanical treatment should not be used; however, if it is too difficult to treat, irrigation can be performed. For prostatitis, vibration massage, Wen's cooling method, electrical massage, and suppositories can be selected. If someone stubbornly adheres to a certain treatment method or a certain inferior medicine until old age, is it not a deception? As for electrotherapy, German Lülin's direct current electrotherapy is even more effective in treating various symptoms.</p>
<p>Specialty: Also treats syphilis, inguinal bubo, chancroid, and painless new method of circumcision.</p>

<h3>Respectfully Announcing to Fellow Physicians, Please Endure the Pain and Generously Contribute</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The establishment of this rescue team is truly a matter of great urgency, and the launch of the fundraising team is truly a matter of last resort. Now, the reasons are briefly stated below. All my colleagues with a heart, whether they are members of this association or not, please carefully consider and enthusiastically donate. This is my sincere plea.</p>
<p>(1) Rescue Plan: A rescue team is planned to be organized and sent to the disaster area, consisting of five doctors and ten nurses, for a period of one year. In addition to the separate provision of medicines and food, the estimated cost is 15,000 yuan, specifically for the hard work and salaries of the dozen or so members of the rescue team.</p>
<p>(2) Fundraising Campaign: Divided into forty-seven teams, each with a dozen or so members, to raise funds in different ways. Whether members of this association or not, doctors or non-doctors, all can be encouraged to donate.</p>
<p>The above two points are a brief overview of the organization of the rescue team fundraising team.</p>
<p>(3) The Situation We Face: At this extraordinary time of widespread mourning and refugees everywhere, it is truly uneasy and inappropriate to be leisurely and adopt a hands-off approach.</p>
<p>(4) Professional Compulsion: We are in the medical profession. Since ancient times, there has been the saying that one would rather be a good doctor than a good minister, meaning that one can save people. Now, at this time, we should do our best to save people so that we will not fail our duties.</p>
<p>(5) Driven by Conscience: The disaster of war has spread to more than ten provinces. People are scattered and displaced, unable to settle down in their homes, and unable to avoid freezing and starvation even with food and clothing. In addition, wounds are not healed, poverty and illness are intertwined, and those who are displaced and on the verge of death number in the hundreds of thousands. We are fortunate to have escaped the tragedy and live day and night. If we are still alive and our hearts have not died, we should endure hunger for a moment and donate generously to accomplish the act of doing good and rescuing the disaster. Thinking about it in the quiet of the night, we feel that it is our duty.</p>
<p>(6) The Expectations of the Public: As doctors, in the face of this disaster, coming forward to take on rescue work is something that people across the country believe is natural, even if they have not explicitly said so. Even colleagues in Shanghai have done their best in various efforts such as saving the country and donating to refugees. However, this is ultimately helping other people's initiatives and is not a righteous act in the capacity of a doctor. This time, it is something that should be done in the capacity of a doctor. Zengzi said, "What ten eyes see and ten hands point at is awe-inspiring." How much more so when it is the collective opinion of the people across the country! How dare we not cherish ourselves?</p>
<p>The above four points are the motives and reasons for organizing the rescue team and launching the fundraising team. There is no excuse on either side. May all my colleagues, based on their personal conscience, and within the limits of their abilities, do their best to support this endeavor. It will not only be the good fortune of this association but also the actual benefit of the people across the country.</p>

<h3>On Eating Raw Foods</h3>
<p>— Shen Gong</p>
<p>Eating raw foods refers to fruits or vegetables that have not been excessively processed. In a broader sense, raw foods include raw milk, raw eggs, raw shrimp, etc. The advantages are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Raw foods are rich in vitamins, so they do not cause vitamin deficiencies.</p>
<p>Raw foods can provide a large number of minerals.</p>
<p>Raw foods do not have the risk of excessive salt intake, so they are quite suitable for kidney, blood vessel, and nervous system disorders.</p>
<p>Raw foods do not contain 嘌呤 (purines), so they are beneficial for gout and those with uric acid problems.</p>
<p>Raw foods are low in protein, so they are good for nephritis and severe diabetes. However, if protein is insufficient, it can be supplemented with walnuts, eggs, milk, etc.</p>
<p>Raw foods have a large volume, are easy to fill, and have low caloric content, so they are suitable for weight loss therapy.</p>
<p>Raw foods contain many indigestible components, which mostly absorb water in the intestines and increase stool volume, so they are suitable for constipation.</p>
<p>Due to the above advantages, raw foods are suitable for constipation, nephritis, edema, obesity, gout, rheumatism, neuralgia, diabetes, neurasthenia, epilepsy, skin diseases, etc. Note: When eating raw foods, special attention must be paid to the risk of infection. Therefore, fruits should be washed before eating at home.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Diseases</p>
<h3>Research on Thinness</h3>
<p>— Wang Wanbai</p>
<p>Healthy men and women should have a moderately fat or thin physique. Being too fat or too thin is a pathological state. It is especially important to avoid thinness in one's twenties, as it may indicate chronic diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis. After the age of forty, obesity should be avoided. Those with large bellies are often prone to high blood pressure and sudden stroke. These should be examined by a scientific doctor as soon as possible, and early prevention and treatment will easily remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>Whether fat or thin, the reasons should be investigated. Physiology is like economics; if income does not cover expenses, one becomes thin; if supply exceeds demand, one becomes fat. The following are some common causes of thinness:</p>
<p>(1) Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Also known as consumption. Before obvious symptoms such as night sweats and hemoptysis appear, weight loss may already be present. Patients often overlook this, so it is important to have an early examination to avoid regret.</p>
<p>(2) Intestinal Parasites: Many people suffer from this disease, especially in childhood. Like resident freeloaders, they consume a large amount of the nutrients obtained with hard work. However, evidence can be found by examining the stool.</p>
<p>(3) Diabetes Mellitus: Sugar in the urine makes it easy to lose weight. In the past, it was called wasting disease. However, in the early stages, most patients are unaware of it. If the urine is tested, it can be discovered immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Excessive Mental and Physical Labor: Some people are busy with work and lack adequate food and sleep; others engage in recreational activities and socializing day and night, which can also cause the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>(5) Poor Digestion: The stomach is responsible for digestion. If one suffers from chronic stomach problems, the nutrients obtained will be insufficient. Initially, only weight gain will be affected, but gradually weight loss will occur.</p>
<p>(6) Glandular Insufficiency: The metabolism of the human body relies heavily on the internal secretions of various glands for regulation. Therefore, when glandular function is insufficient, nutrition will be impaired. For example, atrophy of the thymus gland in children leads to infantile marasmus.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief introduction to the common causes. Other causes will be omitted.</p>
<p>Care</p>
<p>Once the cause of thinness is discovered, treatment should be given according to the cause. If the underlying cause of the disease is ignored, but efforts are focused on nourishing medicines, it will be ineffective. If the leak is not plugged, it will be difficult to accumulate. For example, for common intestinal parasites, medicine must first be taken to expel them before health can be restored. Otherwise, taking tonics will be useless. In addition to symptomatic treatment, the general methods of care are like increasing income and reducing expenses in financial management. The following are also a few points.</p>
<p>(1) Tonics: Since the body is thin, it needs the nourishment of tonics. However, it is necessary to seek those that are easily digested and contain many vitamins, such as fresh milk, fresh cheese, half-cooked eggs, strong beef broth, grape juice, soy milk, cabbage, oranges, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Drinking Water: Drinking more water is a new method for gaining weight. The best beverage is cold boiled water, three or four times a day, one or two large cups each time. The time should be on an empty stomach and not immediately before or after meals. If one is not used to drinking cold water, hot boiled water is also acceptable.</p>
<p>(3) Rest: People with busy lives should try their best to conserve energy and rest at regular times. If children are very thin, they should be encouraged to sleep more in a place with plenty of air and sunlight. However, people who engage in mental labor but not physical labor should have appropriate exercise.</p>
<p>(4) Massage: If the skin is dry and the limbs are thin, olive oil should be applied daily and massaged. The upper and lower limbs and the front and back of the body should be performed at different times in rotation.</p>
<p>(5) Taking Medicine: Internal medicine should be prescribed by a doctor. Do not buy and take medicine randomly. For ordinary care, the most economical and practical is cod liver oil. Adults can take one tablespoon after each meal, and children can take it in moderation.</p>
<p>(6) Injections: Injectable drugs are the greatest contribution of scientific methods. However, they must be administered by a licensed physician. For example, organ preparations related to internal secretions have a significant impact on the body's metabolism. When used properly, they have special effects. Finally, spiritual cultivation is needed, because from ancient times, sorrow leads to illness, and a broad mind leads to a healthy body. We can achieve the highest health method by having no worries of self-reproach within and the joy of benefiting others without.</p>
<p>Disease Statistics</p>
<h3>Report on X-Ray Group Examination for the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhiming</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis (commonly known as consumption) is a major enemy of mankind, as everyone knows. Not only are there many patients among our Chinese people who lack hygienic knowledge, but there are also many patients in European and American countries. Since the Shanghai War, the number of people in the isolated island has increased sharply, and the unsuitable sanitary environment and lack of sunshine have further spread the bacteria. However, if this disease can be diagnosed early and treated surgically as soon as possible, it may not be an incurable disease. The ancients said, "The gentleman is careful about the subtle," which is very true.</p>
<p>X-ray is the only effective tool for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis and other lung diseases. This knowledge has gradually been imprinted in the minds of the people, but unfortunately, it has not yet become widespread. I serve at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, and there is an X-ray group examination every Wednesday and Sunday. Now, I have compiled the results of the examinations in the past six months into a brief report to inform readers.</p>
<p>Number of People: 609</p>
<p>People without Disease: 164</p>
<p>26.93%</p>
<p>People with Pulmonary Tuberculosis: 158</p>
<p>25.94%</p>
<p>Gender: Male 110</p>
<p>Female 48</p>
<p>Age: 7 to 20 years old 30 people</p>
<p>21 to 30 years old 81 people</p>
<p>31 to 40 years old 34 people</p>
<p>41 to 66 years old 13 people</p>
<p>Those with Cavities: 27 people 4.5%</p>
<p>Age: Between 8 and 44 years old</p>
<p>Note: Among them, there is an 8-year-old girl with adult pulmonary tuberculosis forming cavities, and an 18-year-old boy with chronic miliary tuberculosis, both of which are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Hilar Lymph Node: Suspected Tuberculosis 49 people</p>
<p>Hardened: 34 people</p>
<p>Age: 3 to 20 years old</p>
<p>21 to 58 years old</p>
<p>Pleural Thickening: 40 people (31 males, 9 females)</p>
<p>Unclear Lung Apex: 19 people (14 males, 5 females)</p>
<p>Deep Bronchial Shadows: 77 people</p>
<p>Pneumonia: 10 people</p>
<p>Age: 1 to 8 years old 9 people</p>
<p>Large Heart Shadow: 14 people (9 males, 2 females)</p>
<p>Large Aortic Shadow: 6 people (4 males, 2 females)</p>
<p>Others: 2 people (Joint Dislocation)</p>
<p>Looking at the above statistics, those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis actually account for 30%, and those between the ages of 15 and 30 suffer the most. It is believed that lung disease easily attacks young people. This is of great importance to the nation and the people, so anti-tuberculosis work should be vigorously promoted without any delay.</p>
<h3>Drops in the Sea of Medicine</h3>
<p>— Sizhai</p>
<p>Intestinal Obstruction: Why Do Symptoms of Collapse Always Appear?</p>
<p>In the case of intestinal obstruction, symptoms of collapse always appear. There are various theories about its cause. Some say it is due to the stimulation of the peritoneum in the visceral nerve area, which reflexively weakens the function of the heart and blood vessels. Others say it is due to toxins produced by the intestine itself, resulting in self-poisoning. Still others say it is due to the large amount of water seeping into the intestine, resulting in a lack of body fluids, and the accumulation of a large amount of blood in the abdominal cavity, resulting in an uneven distribution of blood flow throughout the body.</p>
<p>Why Does the Stool of Patients with Obstructive Jaundice Have Such a Foul Odor?</p>
<p>The stool of patients with obstructive jaundice has a foul odor that makes people cover their noses because the stool contains higher fatty acids. In the past, it was mistakenly believed that it was caused by intestinal putrefaction, but it is now known that this is not the case. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Broad Discussion of Rights</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Previously, I offered "A Brief Discussion of Rights," but felt it was incomplete. Now, I'll "broaden" it a bit.</p>
<p>I often hear people say, "Why was I born into a poor family? My ancestors left me no inheritance to enjoy." To them, I say, your very origin is your right.</p>
<p>I also hear people say, "Why does my family suffer from so many illnesses, causing me so much pain in caring for them?" To them, I say, your act of caring is also your right.</p>
<p>I also often ponder the mindset of certain people who consider themselves unfortunate to be born in a weak and aging China, rather than in a strong and prosperous foreign country. I always hint to them that being born Chinese is precisely our right.</p>
<p>Indeed, some people often lament, wishing they hadn't been born in this chaotic 20th century of shifting international winds, but rather in the peaceful and prosperous golden age of the past, or the harmonious and joyful world of the future. I can't help but explain to them that being born in this age of upheaval is exactly our right.</p>
<p>In short, in my view, all the suffering, misfortune, and any setbacks or blows in this human world are our rights.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>First, humans have a desire for exclusive possession. All these things, since they are exclusively ours and cannot be shared by others, are nothing less than our rights!</p>
<p>Second, humans have a desire to create. However, countless people live a muddled life and die in comfort. All these things serve as stepping stones, making us the kind of people Mencius described as those "to whom Heaven is about to assign a great responsibility," enabling us to develop and progress. Their shaping of us is undoubtedly a special right we enjoy.</p>
<p>Therefore, conversely, if someone's environment, family, nation, and era are all comfortable, requiring no effort or thought, then I would say that person has lost the meaning of life and is merely a walking corpse. What they enjoy cannot be considered a right at all, but merely fulfilling the obligation of consumption and excretion.</p>
<p>Originally, life is just struggle, just progress. The opportunities for struggle and progress are our rights!</p>
<h3>Romance of Hong Xiuquan</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>— Folk Novel Talk</p>
<p>The second collection, twenty-ninth chapter, of Romance of Hong Xiuquan, is kept in the Peking University and is a stone-printed version, written by Huang Xiaopei from Panyu. The first preface was written by Zhang Binglin in the year of Bingwu (Guangxu thirty-two), and there is also a self-preface, titled "The 4,606th Year of the Yellow Emperor's Reign," which shows that the original twenty-nine chapters were written in the first year of Xuantong, only two years before the Wuchang Uprising. Zhang Binglin was also a strong advocate of revolution, so the national consciousness of this book is correct, even without reading it. I remember that when the Republic of China was founded, I was in Wuhu and only ten years old. I saw a kind of thirty-six open narrow oil-slick paper book popular in the neighborhood, a fake Western-style binding, which is the common paperback binding today. The cover was thin green paper, with the three characters "Hong Xiuquan" written in large characters at the top, with three circles drawn in black ink. Below the words, there was also a line drawing. Each book was thin, with only twenty or thirty pages, and it seemed to have at least the first two collections.</p>
<p>However, the current popular edition has been changed to "The Legend of Hong and Yang, the Brave Heroes," and has been increased to one hundred and forty chapters, quadrupling the original book. I think the one hundred and eleven chapters added later, starting from the fifty-fifth chapter, should have been added by the Qing Dynasty remnants, such as the seventy-eighth chapter title, "Hong's Rebellious Monarch and Ministers All Die, the Zeng Brothers are All Showered with Grace." What glaring words! Hong Xiuquan is called a rebel, and Zeng Guofan and others are called "showered with grace," truly turning black and white upside down. After reading it, I felt that the writing of the first fifty-four chapters was also better. For example, the writing of Li Xiucheng's tactics is extremely clever and interesting. It also has a scholarly air, such as the thirtieth chapter, "Shi Dakai Repels Zeng Guofan with Poetry," which uses Shi Dakai's original letter and five original poems. This can be compared with the famous poems added by Mao Zonggang in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Ah Ying's A History of Late Qing Novels says: "It is a pity that Huang Xiaopei's Romance of Hong Xiuquan was only completed to the fifty-fourth chapter, and the publication date was after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown."</p>
<p>A careful study of this novel is not only beyond the scope allowed, but I also do not have such time and ability. Jian Youwen and Xie Xingyao are probably the most qualified, because they are experts in the study of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Jian Youwen wrote "Miscellaneous Records of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and Xie Xingyao wrote "Collected Essays on the History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Other reference materials include Li Xiucheng's confession, Shi Dakai's diary, a collection of poems and essays from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, interesting documents from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (compiled by Liu Fu), unofficial records of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, unofficial history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc. There are truly countless materials, enough to consume several years of researchers' time. In terms of creation, in addition to Romance of Hong Xiuquan, Chen Baiqing in recent times is the most fond of drawing materials from this. I once introduced him to the two experts, Jian and Xie. His "Jintian Village," also known as "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," has been successful on the stage. "The Death of Shi Dakai" does not seem to have been performed yet, perhaps because the tragic atmosphere is too heavy, not in line with the current era of active resistance? Movies and Peking operas have also used historical events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as themes. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss it in detail in the future.</p>
<h3>How to Move These Two Idols Out?</h3>
<p>— He Han Zuo</p>
<h3>Talking About "Cold" and "Hot"</h3>
<p>— Tie Niu</p>
<p>"Cold" and "Hot" are two absolutely opposite adjectives. What kind of standards are generally used to determine whether they accurately reflect their literal meaning? The answer is: "Cold and hot are standardized through comparison."</p>
<p>Here, we can distinguish the lines of "cold" and "hot": enthusiasm and coldness, warm blood and cold blood, fanaticism and calmness, liveliness and desolation. If we use "life" as an analogy, then children are generally enthusiastic about "games" but indifferent to "love," teenagers are enthusiastic about "love" but indifferent to "games," middle-aged people are enthusiastic about "fame and fortune" but indifferent to "love," and old people are enthusiastic about "comfort and enjoyment" and indifferent to games, love, and fame and fortune.</p>
<p>What China needs now is young people with ardent emotions, holding a crimson heart, valiantly shedding fresh, hot blood, and dedicating everything to the War of Resistance. What China does not need is cold-bloodedness.</p>
<p>"Heat expands and cold contracts" is a law of physics, but it has lost half of its effect in China. In China today, when the flames of the War of Resistance have been ignited in every corner, the people in the rear, no matter how severe and cold the weather is, their enthusiasm for serving their country has reached its peak. Refugees displaced by enemy fire, not wearing cotton clothes and invaded by the biting north wind, can instead encourage the heat of resistance.</p>
<p>Another example is on the front lines: bathing in blood and fighting against the enemy in freezing weather, no matter how cold the weather is, the hearts of the warriors who share the same hatred and fight heroically are boiling with hot blood.</p>
<p>Everyone needs "heat," but too much heat can sometimes cause "cold." If you feel your body is getting hot, so hot that you are sweating profusely, and when you are cold, you are shivering so much that your upper and lower teeth are chattering, this "sudden hot and cold" and "inconstant hot and cold" can determine that you have a "cold and hot disease" and you must quickly ask a doctor for diagnosis and take a few "quinine pills" to drive the "malaria germs" out of the country.</p>
<p>Similarly, certain countries need an enthusiastic and valiant military, and need politicians with calm minds. They have a close connection with each other, otherwise, they will lose the adjustment and neutralization of ""heat"" and ""cold"". If the military is hot, it will rush around; if it is cold, the warriors will be so "tired of war" and "hang themselves". Such "sudden hot and cold" and "inconstant hot and cold" will cause the country's "cold and hot disease". But this cannot be resolved by asking a doctor to diagnose it. The people of the country suffering from "cold and hot disease" must deeply realize that their country is terminally ill, and if they do not quickly rise up to save it, they will inevitably perish together. Then they should unite the masses oppressed by the warlords, raise the great banner of resistance, and eliminate the fascist addiction germs – the warlords – completely.</p>
<h3>Island Trilogy</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Farewell</p>
<p>Early morning - this metropolis is rubbing its sleepy eyes, there are only a few pedestrians on the street. I dragged my heavy steps, accompanying my friend to the ship. We both seemed to have thousands of words to pour out, but we were both silent, words of encouragement, words of farewell... all swallowed quietly, accumulating in our hearts, like a piece of lead.</p>
<p>"Write from over there," I said.</p>
<p>"Work hard here," my friend said.</p>
<p>Our eyes were a little red, and crystal tears were rolling, but not falling. After saying goodbye to each other, we said goodbye with affection and cruelty.</p>
<p>The thick chimney spewed a burst of black mist into the quiet blue sky, curling up and swirling upwards, gradually dispersing and flowing away, fading. The huge hull has also turned into a small black shadow, finally disappearing from sight. Sailing back to the vast ocean, the free coast, carrying those eager to fight back to the fields of the motherland.</p>
<p>Waddling on the pier, as if searching for my own way. "Another one is gone," I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>Nightmare</p>
<p>The winding and undulating peaks seem to climb forward endlessly, covered with messy thorns and rugged rocks. The steep canyons cut out a long and deep gully, and the gully water plays a sad elegy - mourning those unfortunate people who have stumbled.</p>
<p>The twilight is low, and a mass of black shadows is moving forward slowly - it is a marching guerrilla team, but I don't know whether they are returning in triumph or going to do a night attack. The soldiers are silent and careful on their way. "There is a bottomless abyss under the cliff," people are so vigilant, and all their energy is focused on rushing on their way.</p>
<p>"Ah, yo," the sound followed as a black shadow fell quickly.</p>
<p>"It's Ping!" - my friend's name, I don't know who said it.</p>
<p>"It's Ping?" I asked quickly and surprised.</p>
<p>I woke up in a sweat, opened my eyes, and it was pitch black. It turned out to be a nightmare.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Clusters of flowing clouds are rushing in the sky. I was just about to ask him for news about my friend, but the postman brought Ping's letter - a lucky man under the devil's hand, but also mixed with a strong bloody smell.</p>
<p>"×, hello, I am living happily" - it seems to be written in response to my nightmare, "We have contacted the enemy twice, none of our brothers died, we killed a total of nine enemies, and obtained a lot of arms and military supplies, I got a yellow woolen coat..."</p>
<p>In my fantasy, I seemed to see a scene of battle: Ping and countless warriors were chasing the fleeing enemy, one dwarf after another fell, and the plaster flag lay lazily on the ground, hugging the cold soil for a boring time. The blue sky, white sun, and red earth are waving on the wilderness.</p>
<h3>Song of Youth</h3>
<p>— Zou Yaosheng</p>
<p>In the midst of this great era,</p>
<p>Why do we still sing of sorrow?</p>
<p>Listen, the wind and clouds are also roaring out war songs,</p>
<p>Flying over East Asia and flying to Western Europe.</p>
<p>We must ignite the raging fire in our hearts,</p>
<p>What does hardship and displacement count for?</p>
<p>How can we let the fate of youth,</p>
<p>Be arbitrarily manipulated by evil spirits?</p>
<p>Cut off our ignorant love,</p>
<p>Grasp our iron fists tightly!</p>
<p>Do it! We must seize the eternal determination,</p>
<p>Never raise the weary form of toil;</p>
<p>Everything was never dominated by anyone,</p>
<p>Everything was never controlled by anyone.</p>
<p>No one can endure this dark barbarity,</p>
<p>Remove that ghostly spirit of old age.</p>
<p>The earth-shaking thunder is inspiring our vigilance,</p>
<p>The dazzling lightning illuminates the light of the future;</p>
<p>We must pick up our pace and run wildly!</p>
<p>Grasp the liberation, freedom, and peace tightly.</p>
<p>Break through the rugged long road,</p>
<p>Not afraid of poisonous snakes or fierce tigers,</p>
<p>We must fulfill the mission of youth,</p>
<p>Turn the wheel of the times and transform the ancient and the modern.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>At noon, One-Eyed Li indeed arrived with Xiao Mazi for the banquet. On the surface, he did not bring any guards, but many of his followers who came to respond secretly had already mixed in, mostly lurking in the small teahouse opposite the Township Office. Regiment Commander Ye was in full military uniform, wearing a short sword, and came out to meet One-Eyed Li, and extended his hand wearing white gloves and shook hands with One-Eyed Li, and very courteously invited them to take their seats.</p>
<p>There were not many people at the banquet, only Regiment Commander Ye and Deputy Regiment Commander Liang. This was also prearranged by Regiment Commander Ye, fearing that other people would lack cultivation and reveal clues in their expressions, causing One-Eyed Li to see through them and causing the affair to fail.</p>
<p>The people at this banquet were quite mismatched. Regiment Commander Ye and Deputy Regiment Commander Liang were both regular military officers after all, with an imposing demeanor and heroic spirit. One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi, however, were from the background of salt smugglers and bandits, with wretched appearances and rough manners. However, one thing was the same, both sides had deep wariness.</p>
<p>After Deputy Regiment Commander Liang poured a round of wine on the table, Regiment Commander Ye raised his glass and shined it at One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi. Although the two also raised their glasses in the same way, they seemed to be afraid that the wine was poisoned. You looked at me and I looked at you, and neither dared to drink. Regiment Commander Ye laughed heartily and drank a cup of wine in one breath, put down his cup, and said to One-Eyed Li with a solemn expression:</p>
<p>"Now the national crisis is so severe, the enemy's brutality has destroyed humanity. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. There is only one way out in front of us, and that is to resist the war. We should all not ask about the past, and must work together to implement the National United Front, follow national policy, and desperately resist our national enemies to the end."</p>
<p>As he spoke, his imposing eyes, shining with light, kept scanning the faces of One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi. The two seemed to be a little intimidated, and just nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye paused slightly for a while, and then said:</p>
<p>"I also know that your team is very strong, but the most important thing at the moment is unified organization and command. The so-called division is like scattered knives, and unity is strength. Therefore, I hope that your team can join us and cooperate with us, reorganize again, and the supplies and salaries will be the same as ours, and I will definitely not treat you badly. As for the detailed plan for the reorganization, I have prepared it here."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he reached into his military uniform pocket. One-Eyed Li and Xiao Mazi's faces changed, and they also reached for their waists, but later saw that what Regiment Commander Ye took out was a piece of paper, and then they let go of their minds. (26)</p>

<h3>The Wonderful Use of Astrologers</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Japanese warlords have always used a kind of anesthetizing means to encourage the people's ambition to invade. Therefore, things like "amulets" and "thousand-person stitches" are their supreme treasures for using Shinto to teach and fool their people. The baseness and stupidity of this method is actually the same as Empress Dowager Cixi's use of the "Boxers" to think that guns and cannons could not enter and knives and fire could not hurt, which is equally ridiculous.</p>
<p>Recently, they even came up with a novel idea and invented a new way to deceive the people. According to a Reuters report yesterday, "Thirty astrologers in Tokyo have organized a guild after being instructed by the police chief, and decided to encourage those who come to ask about their future fortunes to be optimistic during this emergency period of fighting against China." This base and mediocre method is not only ridiculous, but also pitiful. In such a large Tokyo, only thirty fortune tellers are allocated, which may be insufficient. Moreover, the astrologer can lie and fabricate anything to those who come to ask about their future fortunes. Assuming that the people of Tokyo do not come to ask about their future fortunes, then the astrologer's heroism will be useless, and there will be nothing to lie about. What should we do? Here, I can also offer a supplementary method.</p>
<p>As long as the police chief issues an order: (1) All people living in Tokyo must go to an astrologer to ask about their good and bad fortunes. Those who do not go to an astrologer to ask about their good and bad fortunes will be regarded as harboring reactionary thoughts. (2) All people living in Tokyo, regardless of gender, age, or size, must carry a piece of "fortune-telling book," just like the people in our country's guerrilla areas must have a "pass," "smallpox vaccination certificate," and "epidemic prevention certificate." If a person's side or home has no "fortune-telling book," they can be treated as treasonous. In this way, the anti-war thoughts of the Japanese people will have no way to occur and can be fundamentally eradicated. Isn't this a wonderful method?</p>
<p>However, the principle of astrologers is to "ask about disasters, not about blessings." Assuming that the astrologers in Tokyo are as honest as "Zhang Tiekuo" and "Li Tiezui" according to the principles of astrologers, and tell the truth without concealment, I am afraid that all the people in Tokyo will be shaken, and most of the gunpowder stores in Japan will be as dangerous as Osaka. Even if the astrologers can obey the order and imitate the law, since the start of the war, for twenty months, the goods have been expanding day by day, the economy has been shrinking day by day, the population has been decreasing day by day, the number of widows has been increasing day by day, and the "honor" cemeteries of fallen soldiers are everywhere, and the ashes of strong men are continuously transported back from warships. Under these circumstances, I think that even if these astrologers are eloquent and say how wonderful it is, the people in Tokyo will still not be able to believe it? Therefore, this method only shows their hard work and daily ineptitude. From this, I see the boredom of the Japanese warlords and the busyness of their hands and feet.</p>
<h3>Loyalty and Righteousness</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>“Arkansas Traveler”</p>
<p>Paramount production, Cathay Theatre screening</p>
<p>Among the many small films recently shown, we must specifically single out a film like "Loyalty and Righteousness," which is clear, simple, and educational and combative at the same time, to introduce to the readers of this newspaper.</p>
<p>This film can be said to have diverse characteristics:</p>
<p>First, it teaches us how to fight calmly - in the story, the author introduced two very strong and powerful characters through latent enthusiasm, using very vivid strokes: (1) a young man who was afraid of things and avoided them at first, but later became someone who did not avoid reality and knew how to fight against evil forces, although he went through many difficulties and reefs, but in the end, he was victorious: (2) a middle-aged man who handled things calmly and had a plan, he saw the facts very clearly, did not act impulsively, was not sloppy, and fought calmly with steps and order, and as a result, he overcame all difficulties.</p>
<p>Second, the achievements in artistic quality - this story of the "Arkansas Traveler" that expresses a beautiful dramatic form, it is very successful in the writing of the script and the description of the center of the whole play; the reason for its success can be listed in three points: (1) the writing of the script is very compact; it introduces the characters' appearance on the stage very lively and beautifully; (2) the background is a small town in the United States, so it is very simple and full of authenticity; (3) the main characters are very solid and simple; the wanderer whose surname is unknown; the young electrical engineer; the kind mother who knows how to fight; the innocent and young brother; the sister who was once confused by vanity; these four characters, under the author's delicate and lively carving, have given us a very gentle and lovely image.</p>
<p>But the most lovable thing about the whole play, I think, is that the script can echo back and forth. When the young electrical engineer John was preparing to escape, the middle-aged wanderer used the crime of stealing a watch to have the town police arrest him and make him stay in the town to continue fighting; until the end of the whole play, when their radio station was completed and they re-elected the mayor and the newspaper was published as usual, when the wanderer was preparing to quietly leave the town, John also used the crime of stealing a watch to drag the wanderer back; the audience laughed loudly when they saw this.</p>
<p>Third, the director's technique should be inferred - we don't seem to have seen the name of the director of this film; however, he was able to pass on the emotions of the audience in this full of sincere feelings and heat.</p>
<p>I think the director of this film has one of the greatest advantages, that is, he has an unusually strong grasp of the emotional atmosphere. He not only makes people accept the emotions in the play, but also makes us very moved. For example: (1) at the beginning of the construction of the radio station, hundreds of workers were added from the train. They carried various engineering materials, and the workers held torches in their hands. When they passed through the streets, the men and women in their pajamas pushed open the windows, and many quickly ran to the street. The town was disturbed by the construction of this radio station project. In this commotion scene, it contains how much enthusiasm and sympathetic faces - the director expressed the atmosphere and emotions unusually beautifully in these scenes. (2) The radio station was completed, the wanderer, the mother, and John gave speeches, and the listeners in every corner of the town listened excitedly, agitatedly, and quietly to the broadcast; on the radio station, the mother was so moved that she was about to cry; John attacked the local politicians and the mayor (his father) with a fierce speech, and the wanderer made the listeners laugh with a humorous tone. These excellent effects are all the result of the director's excellent and concise picture weaving.</p>
<p>There are four main actors, namely Bob Burns (wanderer), Fay Bainter (mother), John Beal (electrical engineer), Joan Paige (daughter), Dick Moore (brother), all of whom performed skillfully and sincerely.</p>
<h3>Catchphrase</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Catchphrases are useful everywhere these days, and needed everywhere. If you don't have a catchphrase, or can't think of one, then don't expect to compete or survive in your society. Because of this, catchphrase friends are everywhere; catchphrase stories emerge endlessly. Some catchphrase friends are already born with catchphrases, while others are still desperately trying to come up with them. The catchphrases performed can be worthy of song, or worthy of tears.</p>
<p>The meaning of a catchphrase is novelty. What is called novelty is not falling into old patterns. Therefore, a catchphrase needs to have the condition of transcending thought or action. Having such conditions can express novel thoughts and novel actions. Only by being able to do this can it be moving to hear, and only then can it achieve victory. However, the arrival of a catchphrase not only requires the catchphrase friend to have considerable instinct, but also to coordinate with the requirements of space and time. Otherwise, if you use your catchphrase, people will ignore you, and as a result, the catchphrase is declared a failure, and you collapse along with it. Therefore, clever and skillful catchphrase friends will examine the needs of space and time when thinking of a catchphrase. If they encounter obstacles, they will also create a space and time suitable for the catchphrase. Then, they use the catchphrase for heaven and earth, using the catchphrase for what it is meant to be. From this, we can draw a conclusion. The success of a catchphrase lies in having spatial and temporal attributes; and the failure of a catchphrase lies in the disappearance of its spatial and temporal attributes. It is pitiful for those naive friends who, in order to show their ability and develop their grand plans, exhaust their minds and rack their brains thinking of catchphrases. However, they lack the subjective conditions and deny objective facts, so it is no wonder that they encounter a fate of failure.</p>
<p>Using catchphrases in certain situations, or for certain events, occasionally or accidentally, may not be too reprehensible; but what it induces is the deepening of social paralysis, which is truly terrible. Because catchphrases not only need to win with novelty, but also need to overcome the enemy with stimulation. Constantly showing off novelty and constantly stimulating and enticing will inevitably lead to numbness of the human heart. Therefore, we believe that frequent use of catchphrases in business will promote the decline of credibility; and frequent use of catchphrases in general work will promote the loss of faith in work, leading to a vicious change. For the sake of work and for the sake of career, catchphrases must not be used frequently. Unexpectedly, catchphrase friends are still unwilling to give up their catchphrase policy, and continue to create catchphrases, piling up the current catchphrase society, catchphrase world! It is precisely:</p>
<p>If catchphrases don't die, great disasters won't stop!</p>
<h3>Bees</h3>
<p>— Ye Nong</p>
<p>Beekeeping is an inherent industry in our country. In the Han and Jin dynasties, beekeeping methods had already been invented, but due to adhering to old methods and not knowing how to research and improve, the bee species were mixed, the quality was poor, and the honey production was not high. Furthermore, the keepers let them live and die on their own, did not know how to collect and catch escapees, and did not know how to remedy the weak, resulting in no progress for thousands of years, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>In European and American countries, beekeeping is regarded as an important industry, and the government vigorously promotes it, with remarkable results. Taking the United States as an example, since actively promoting beekeeping, there are more than one million people raising honeybees, with more than fifteen million hives. The annual honey production is worth more than 80 million US dollars, and the by-product beeswax is also worth more than 4 million US dollars. Looking at our country, with its vast territory, mild climate, and abundant flowers and plants, it is definitely a very suitable place for beekeeping. If it can be widely promoted in the future, it will truly be a very promising industry.</p>
<p>Let's not underestimate bees. Although they are small insects, if we carefully examine the contents of a bee colony, it truly makes us admire them. They can build neat and beautiful hexagonal honeycombs themselves. The queen bee specializes in reproduction, and the worker bees are responsible for external honey collection, cleaning the hive, and raising larvae, so the inside of the hive is very clean. If foreign enemies invade, they will attack in groups. Even if they die piled up, they will continue to fight until the final victory. Bees have very sensitive senses, very brave personalities, and work very diligently. Their organization is orderly, united, and spirited, like a complete social organization. And in many places, humans are probably not even as good as them!</p>
<p>Beekeeping is a very interesting thing. If you do things while beekeeping, as a sideline, as long as there is abundant honey source, if everyone raises four or five colonies, the honey produced each year can also replace imported sugar.</p>
<p>In the past, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in our country produced two types of honey: one is the purple alfalfa honey from Songjiang, and the other is the tallow tree honey from Tongxiang. The former is white in color and can be used for consumption, while the latter is amber in color and can be used as a substitute for sugar. Currently, the candied plums and various candies and biscuits of Shanghai Guanshengyuan mostly use honey, because it is cheap and nutritious.</p>
<p>Before the war, there were also many private beekeeping farms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with great scale and complete equipment. The annual honey production was about more than 2,000 dan. Compared with the United States, it is a small sight compared to a large one, but the tens of millions of yuan that our country spends each year on purchasing sugar, which flows abroad, has been invisibly recovered.</p>
<p>After the national army moved west, the bee farms in the guerrilla areas were mostly destroyed by artillery fire. Even the intact ones were stolen, and the bee colonies were lost without a trace. Even if they are restored in the future, the losses will be considerable.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Spring Comes to Bilo, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Filling Lake Li</p>
<p>Zhu Ai'ren smiled and said: "Is our Professor Wu not only a young lady, but also a young master?" Wu Junsu also smiled and said: "Dr. Zhu is nitpicking. I am a case by association, and in fact I was still young at that time and had never been a young lady. But my family has several uncles and aunts who have enjoyed some comfortable days. Anyway, the family's annual income is enough to use. Each year, a certain amount of rent rice is collected from the fields. When the Frost's Descent season arrives, the family opens the warehouse to collect rent rice. The people in the city do not collect rent rice, but convert it into market prices. The people in the countryside will come to the city one after another to pay the rent rice, and this year's income will be considerable. In addition, we also have city houses that are rented out to people, and rent can be collected every month. We also have shops, such as money houses, cloth shops, and sauce gardens, and there are quite a few of them. Roughly these shops can make money, but some make more and some make less. Therefore, the people in our family, whether old or young, do not have to seek any work and can sit at home and eat. Needless to say, the older people, the men smoke opium, and the women play mahjong. The young people should normally study, but it is rare to find a few people who concentrate on their studies. Among them, my father is a person who devotes himself to learning, and my mother is also a high school graduate. In addition, our several uncles, nominally studying at school, are fishing for three days and drying nets for four days. Some don't even go to school. Every day after lunch, they take a very beautiful chartered car—cars were not yet popular in Suzhou at that time—the car bells jingled, and a strong driver pulled the car and rushed to Guanqian Street, which can be regarded as showing off. The most prosperous and lively street in Suzhou City is in front of the Xuanmiao Temple, called Guanqian Street, just like Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Guanqian Street has everything, either watching movies, or drinking tea and listening to books. When returning home, they buy some candies and tea snacks, and invite a few friends to play small cards, and this day is considered to have passed. What the women, like our several aunts, are most concerned about is what kind of clothes are the most fashionable recently, and what kind of hairstyle is the most modern? Everything must follow the example of Shanghai. Shanghai's style is all good. They have nothing to do, so they take a trip to Shanghai, in order to observe what kind of clothing is the most popular in Shanghai. I was still young at that time and didn't pay much attention to anything, but I only heard them discussing long cheongsams and short Manchu robes. Regarding hairstyles, there are also wave styles, airplane styles, and Mrs. Simpson styles, and I simply couldn't understand them. Even I was dressed up by them, wearing a doll-style short skirt, revealing a section of my legs." (May Fourth)</p>

<h3>Southern Film News</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge, from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qingxian, the owner of the Nanyue Company, once returned to Hong Kong, and then went to Shanghai. It is heard that this trip was to continue discussing with the Xinhua Company the issue of Hu Die starring in another film after "Rouge Tears." It is also heard that the male lead may be Xue Juexian. One is the leading actress in film, and the other is a well-known star in the South. If it comes true, it will be quite a sensation. However, the issue of the ranking of Hu and Xue is not easy to resolve. Because both of them are famous for a while, who would be willing to be inferior? Some say that Hu Die will be ranked first in the Mandarin copy, while Xue will be ranked first in the Cantonese copy. This is also a compromise.</p>
<p>Chi Mingyou, the former general manager of Lianhua Company, and Li Minwei, the former director of Lianhua Factory, jointly founded the Zhenguang Film Company with the bishop of the Hong Kong Chinese Church, specializing in producing religious films that promote the greatness of God. However, the church insisted that each film must be 100% religious propaganda quality, which is difficult to gain public interest. They proposed the opinion of half entertainment and half propaganda, but it was opposed by the church, and the matter was deadlocked. Luo Nai and Li reorganized the International Film Company, hiring the famous director Fei Mu as a screenwriter and director. The first film is scheduled to be "The Cry of Humanity," which also contains religious flavor. It is said that Luo has recently converted to Christianity and goes to church every week to sincerely worship. Fei's thoughts have also been influenced. "The Cry of Humanity" is planned to be filmed in English, but the capital is still a problem, so the date of filming has not been decided.</p>
<p>Since Lin Shusen came on stage, the full version of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" performed on the third night was the most popular. Before 7 o'clock, the entire theater was full. Lin alone played the three roles of Lu Su, Kong Ming, and Guan Gong, extremely hard. On that night, many people from the Hong Kong and Chinese opera and film circles also came. Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing specially sent a horizontal plaque with the words "True Spirit of National Defense Drama" written on it. There were also many others who sent flower baskets and horizontal plaques. Lin once entertained the Hong Kong press. A reporter asked him about his impressions of coming to Hong Kong. Lin replied: "This time I came to Hong Kong purely because of the warm invitation of old friends, which I could not refuse. But since I am here, I should stand on my own position and perform more meaningful historical dramas. I think this is not only in today's troubled times, but also in times of peace, we should move forward... After the performance, I plan to go to Singapore, Little Luzon and other places, because there are very few opportunities for Peking opera to be performed overseas, so this time I am determined to go overseas and use the warning function of drama to achieve publicity effectiveness."</p>
<p>The Yihua Company's historical film "Chu Overlord" has had good business since it was shown at the Entertainment Theater from the first to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year. Recently, the seats for Mandarin films in Hong Kong have often exceeded those for Cantonese films. Because there are many people from other provinces staying in Hong Kong, Cantonese films are restricted by language, and foreign films may not be liked. There are many theaters in Hong Kong Entertainment City, so when a Mandarin film comes, everyone flocks to it.</p>
<p>The film industry in South China has also recently become popular in shooting Mandarin films, or shooting Cantonese copies in addition to Cantonese, or re-dubbing Cantonese films into Mandarin, planning to seek a way out in Shanghai. However, the price difference between Hong Kong dollars and national currency is almost double. With the cost of Hong Kong dollars, the tax revenue for each film shipped to Shanghai is about a thousand yuan, so it is still uncertain whether it is cost-effective. Currently, it is all experimental in nature. The Mandarin film "A Generation of Femme Fatale," starring Li Li, cost about 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is slightly less than 40,000 national currency. The purpose of the film is to seek the business market in Shanghai. Zhang Weitao, the agent of the film's distribution affairs (also the Hong Kong distribution representative of Xinhua, Yihua and other companies), made a special trip to Shanghai to negotiate the screening of the film in Shanghai. The Lianyi Company expects the revenue of the film in Shanghai alone to be 30,000 national currency, but it is still uncertain whether it can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>A company in Shanghai recently sent a letter urging Li Zhuozhuo and Zhang Yi to return to Shanghai to make films, but Li and Zhang have no intention of leaving Hong Kong. Because the weather here is mild, and they are now only wearing thin jackets (Cantonese people are already wearing single cloth clothes and trousers), and the swimming season is coming soon (in fact, there are many swimmers in Hong Kong even in winter). Li and Zhang are both fond of this. Anyway, they have a lot of savings. Even if there are no plays to film in Hong Kong, the living expenses for two or three years are not a problem, so they are all happy and don't want to return to Shu.</p>
<p>Hollywood newcomer Corinne Calvet is said to have the strange habit of not wearing a hat and is recently playing a major role in the new "Prison Without Bats."</p>
<h3>New Year's Trends of Famous Peking Opera Singers in the Old Capital (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Lan</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year in the Peking opera circle of the old capital, the atmosphere of embellishing peace is no less than that of the isolated island. Therefore, the trends of each famous singer are described separately below, so that we can see a general picture.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng has been performing in the Chang'an and Qingle theaters since the Spring Festival. In addition to his son Xun Lingxiang (also works in the Huashan role, inheriting his father's mantle) performing on the same stage, the entire class of famous actors includes Xu Deyi, Jin Hongkui, Lin Qiuwen, Chen Xixing, He Peihua, Wang Wenyuan, and more than sixty others. Recently, on the ninth day of the first lunar month, he performed "Flower Field Wrong Marriage" and "Three Mothers Teaching the Son" at Chang'an. On the tenth day of the first lunar month, he performed "The Complete Du Shiniang" and "Touring the Dragon and Teasing the Phoenix" at Qingle.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu</p>
<p>On the evening of the Lunar New Year's Day, he performed "Part of the Beauty Trick" (Ganlu Temple, Returning to Jingzhou, Reed Flower Marsh) at Xinxin. The entire cast of supporting roles included Wang Shaolou, Zhong Mingqi, Gu Juesun, Lin Qiuwen, Zhu Guifang, Cao Ergeng, Su Lianzhang, Sun Futing, Zhang Chunyan, Ji Yanfen, Li Debin, Wu Fuqin, Zhong Xijiu, and Ci Ruiquan. After that, he did not continue to perform.</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun</p>
<p>He did not perform during the Spring Festival this year. He himself held a banquet for guests for his fortieth birthday last winter, which was a grand occasion for a while. Therefore, newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing have published his thank-you notices in recent days, which reads: "I am ashamed of my youth. The beautiful scenery is easily thrown away. Wine and joy entertain guests. Old travels are elegant gatherings. The court is full of brocade and embroidery. The face is praised and encouraged. The eyes are full of gifts. Rare treasures are arranged. Praise is given in writing. Calligraphy and paintings are all from famous people. The favor is more constant. Huanwei seal script. Xiaoyun's half-life art. Does not compensate for the fleeting time. Forty years of time. Only increases the age. Listening to the New Year's Eve drums tomorrow morning. Unforgettable the Buddha Bathing auspicious day. Facing the spring breeze in the four seats. Still wishing the governor a long life. Especially respectful thanks. Respectfully wish you all the best. I hope you will show your concern. Shang Xiaoyun bows."</p>
<p>Tan Fuying</p>
<p>After returning to Ping from Guandi the previous year, he performed in various theaters one after another. On the evening of the New Year's Day of the God of Wealth, he performed his Tan opera masterpiece "Losing Jieting" (Kongming sits in the tent and tearfully beheads Su) at Qingle, which was specially requested by the business community. In the previous show, there were also "Cosmic Peak," "Baisuitan," and "Satisfied Fate." The cast of supporting roles included Chen Lifang, Yang Shengchun, Jiang Miaoxiang, and more than fifty others.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun</p>
<p>After his father Li Guichun (Xiaodazi) finished performing at the Tianjin China Grand Theater and came to Ping, he was introduced by a gentleman from Shanghai and became a disciple of Yu Shuyan. Once he ascended the dragon gate, his reputation soared. He has repeatedly offered monkey operas to the world, and is quite able to compete with Li Wanchun. His cast of supporting roles included Shen Kunhua, Gao Weilian, and more than sixty others. I can't list them all.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Peking Opera in the Old Capital (122)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Secret Story of Jingzhong Temple Being Occupied by Incense Taoists</p>
<p>After Chang Geng, Liu Gansan, Yu Jusheng, Tan Xinpei and others successively took over as the head of the temple, they still followed the rules and regulations set by the big boss, and there was not much change. However, the temple's property has increased a lot compared to before. After the Republic of China, the head of the temple was renamed the President of the Peking Opera Guild. Lao Tan and others passed away one after another, and among the older generation, only Xiaolou, Yaoqing, and Fengqing were more well-known. Later, the Shenghang declined, and the four famous Dan became more powerful. Master Shang (Xiaoyun), who had a desire for leadership, cultivated personal labor, and there was also a capable qin master named Zhao Yankui (Zhao Si), who helped him devise plans and win over the predecessors of the industry. At the same time, Xiaoyun was really able to help the poor and the needy, and sometimes even pawned things to help the poor and old colleagues. Therefore, when electing the president, he was always re-elected. It is said that the most powerful people who secretly helped Xiaoyun's activities and took the opportunity to break up the unity of the acting world were the incense Taoist masters and disciples of Jingzhong Temple. As the saying goes, "When the snipe and the clam fight, the fisherman benefits." It turned out that Jiao Laodao, who guarded the temple, and his second disciple He, had long harbored the ambition to seize the temple property. In the past, because the heads of the temple would often come to the temple to inspect it and handle things very seriously, they did not dare to think about it. Since the Republic of China, people like Lao Tan have had very deep hobbies and get up late, so they have no free time to manage these trivial matters outside of themselves. From then on, people rarely visited the temple. Whenever there were festivals or major events, Jiao Laodao and his disciples would report to a few heads of the acting industry separately, and that was it. When the Peking Opera Guild was officially established, a new address was built on Cherry Diagonal Street, with offices for various departments inside. From then on, whenever there were matters to discuss, they would come here. Jiao Laodao had plenty of money, so he took some out to make friends in the officialdom, widely recruited disciples (An Qing disciples), and hired a Donghong teacher for his second disciple, He. When there was nothing to do, he would often talk about opera and report some news from the acting industry. Although the name of Xiaolao He was often seen in the Qunqiang and Shishi Baihua newspapers, he actually couldn't recognize a few words, and it was all written by others. Year after year, he was actually considered a member of the Ping opera circle in Beiping. How dare the actors treat them as incense Taoists? They even have a good trick, which is to become dry relatives with whatever role is popular. When Chang Maliang's reputation soared a few years ago, Jiao Laodao accepted him as his godson. No matter where Lianliang lived and performed in Tianjin and Han, Laodao always followed him, providing travel expenses himself.</p>
<h3>Qian Qian's Room Drama Talk</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people talk about Huashan, they must mention Wang Yaoqing as the master of a generation. Yaoqing has dozens of students, especially Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, who are the most proud of him. In his later years, Yaoqing was plagued by his voice, and his situation was not good. He had to use his artistic skills to instruct the younger generation, and he was able to teach according to their aptitude, adapt to their nature, and patiently guide them. Lanfang and Yanqiu, although not completely taught by Yaoqing, were able to develop their own personalities, gradually progress, and move forward, creating today's status. It is worth praising that Lanfang and Yanqiu have worked hard on their own. It is also not impossible to say that the two Mes and Cheng have today's achievements due to Yaoqing's support. Speaking of the strengths of the two Mes and Cheng, Mei's performance is deeply studied, with delicate and appropriate touches, and the singing is clear, soft, and wide, bright and pure, without losing the palace tone, gentle and lovely, sweet and refreshing, and charming. However, it lacks a rigid tone. The singing makes people love it, makes people happy, but it alone cannot make people surprised. The clear and moving white mouth is the most resonant, and insiders say that his dubbing is also in the Gongzi tune, and he is the only one in the country. Yanqiu is known for his dignified, quiet, and skilled attitude, his melodious and tortuous singing, and his restrained expression, without any frivolous attitude. Cheng's singing is best at tragedy. His singing is melancholy, choked, sad, and heartbreaking, and can make people cry. Therefore, those who love to listen to new tunes and study tunes like to listen to Cheng's tunes. However, Cheng's tune is too sad and is not really a palace tone. Cheng himself is well aware of this point. The singing of the two Mes and Cheng can be said to have their own strengths. In terms of tone, Mei is better. In terms of tune, Cheng is good at creating new sounds alone. We don't have to force ourselves to distinguish between superiority and inferiority. Lanfang has been worthy of the title of pride of the Peking opera circle from the early Republic of China to today. Yanqiu followed suit and was able to draw his sword and establish his own banner. Nowadays, those who learn Huashan, either enter Mei or enter Cheng. Even if there are those who follow other schools, what they reveal must also contain some components of Mei and Cheng. There is no doubt about it. Among the Kun Dan, Xue Yanqin can be regarded as the one who learns Mei the most (she also extracts the strengths of Huisheng and Xiaoyun), and her swordsmanship and Hua Dan are also far above those of Eyun and Youqin. She is also the chief among Kun Dan. The one who learns Cheng is Xin Yanqiu. As for the others who combine the strengths of the two Mes and Cheng and take them for their own, it should be Zhang Eyun. Zhang Ling is proficient in both the old and new tunes of Mei and Cheng, and his dubbing follows Wan Hua, and his body movements follow both Mei and Cheng. His eyes are expressive of his feelings, and he follows Cheng's method. His water sleeves are very good, and the stability of running around the arena and the cushion behind him are indeed real skills that others cannot match. In the past, Eyun mostly used Wanhua as a model. Since Yan Mutiefen became the qin master, his singing and expression have changed to the Cheng school. Today, when talking about Kun Ling Dan, we have to recommend Eyun as the first. Eyun gets the two words "quiet and skilled," while Xin Yanqiu gets the two words "show and escape," which others cannot achieve.</p>
<h3>Film Snippets</h3>
<p>— Fang Lin</p>
<p>According to a letter from a friend in Hong Kong, Lin Shusen's performance in Hong Kong was very popular, especially the Guan Gong play, which was the most popular. Xue Juexian of Nanyue Company plans to hire Lin to shoot a costume film of Guan Gong. It is said that Lin has agreed, and the terms of both parties have been negotiated. If so, the living Guan Gong on the silver screen will definitely cause a sensation.</p>
<p>The Chang and Company of the Carlton Theater Authority plans to shoot a film "Empress Dowager Cixi" and "Wen Suchen." The heroine of "Empress Dowager Cixi" has been decided as Jin Suqin, and "Wen Suchen" will be played by Jin Suwen. Everything is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian, who has been out of the film circle for a long time, went to Hong Kong to avoid the war after the August 13 Incident. Recently, she has returned to the film circle and has signed a contract with Guohua Film Company to play the leading role in Zhang Shichuan's "Night Pearl."</p>

<p>Chess News: We recently received letters from readers stating that various arts have places for learning, but the art of chess alone is lacking, which is regrettable. Since chess is one of the national quintessences, it is requested that methods be found to promote popularization and teaching, etc. We believe that teaching chess is not easy (because the teaching methods do not have a fixed scope). It all depends on the instructor having a kind of mysterious guidance that enables the students to understand implicitly before it is effective. Therefore, teaching is extremely difficult. If one is not both knowledgeable and excellent, it is difficult to have a good attraction. Therefore, when teaching, one must first examine the psychology of the students, and then provide separate guidance in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. We have received many letters from all walks of life urging us to establish the Yiyuan Correspondence Chess School with several like-minded people. Detailed rules are available. A stamped self-addressed envelope (two cents postage) should be enclosed with the request. Enrollment begins immediately. (Report to: Chengzhengping Law Firm, 2nd Floor, No. 89 Fuzhou Road, our school office.)</p>
