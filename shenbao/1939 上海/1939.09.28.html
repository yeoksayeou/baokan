<h3>德外長再訪莫斯科　會商軍事外交各問題　　蘇聯勢力向波羅的海方面伸展壓迫愛沙尼亞締廣泛政治協定</h3>
<p>莫斯科　德國外長里賓特洛浦、應蘇聯政府邀請、業於本日乘飛機抵達此間、將與蘇聯政府會商與波蘭事件有關之各項問題、（二十七日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>柏林　德外長里賓特羅甫、應蘇聯政府之邀請、今晨九時乘「格蘭資馬克」號飛機、由坦泊爾霍夫飛機場飛往莫斯科、蘇聯駐德大使希克瓦賽夫·大使館秘書拍夫洛夫·及里氏之僚屬數人伴其同行、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德外長里賓特羅甫偕蘇聯駐德大使等三十六人、今晨九時乘飛機自柏林啟程飛往莫斯科、聞但擇領袖孚斯德亦在其內、午前十一時十五分抵柯尼斯堡、稍停片刻即續飛莫斯科、今日午後六時可抵莫斯科之民用飛機場、大約明日以前未必即開始任何談話、蓋土耳其代表團今亦在莫斯科也、土國代表團將於明日離莫斯科、蘇京外交界相信里賓特羅甫此次飛蘇、不僅爲波蘭事件、必尙挾有其他重要問題、如蘇德軍事同盟或聯合阻止土國加入英法集團是也、倫敦報紙對於德外長往游莫斯科之意義、不作輕牽之推測、若干觀察家以外交上另有炸彈刻在醞釀中爲慮、但亦有人相信史丹林對於希特勒猜疑之甚、正不遜於英法而以此自慰（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　德外長里賓特洛浦訪問莫斯科之消息宜布後、柏林人士均密切注視、因德蘇條約、規定兩國有討論兩國共同利益各項問題之義務、故一般人對於德外長之訪問、並不驚異、且波蘭崩潰後、其領士之未來命運、有加以考慮之必要也、據政界人士指稱、德蘇兩國分界綫、僅係劃定德蘇兩國軍隊應即佔領之區域、不應視爲最後之疆界、衆信里賓特洛浦將利用訪問莫斯科之機會、與蘇聯政府、討論其他外交問題、即西綫英法兩國之侵略戰、及愛莎尼亞及土耳其兩外長訪問莫斯科所引起之各項問題是也、因此項訪問之特殊性質、不能於其程序有所規定、關於里氏在蘇聯停留之久暫、亦未探獲消息云、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德國外長里賓特洛浦、定於明日前來此間、各外國觀察家咸謂、上月二十三日以來、里實特洛浦外長之來聘、此爲第二次、但蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、乃至副委員長波丹金、固迄未報聘也、又愛沙尼亞外長塞雨特、日前一度來此後、即忽忽返國、出席內閣臨時會議、頃聞又已二次前來莫斯科、一般人以爲、蘇聯對於愛沙尼亞國抱何意願、德國極爲焦慮、因此里賓特洛浦之二度來聘、殆與愛沙尼亞問題有關、此外、蘇聯軍隊之在波蘭境內者、現已逐漸開近德蘇兩國所定之界綫、即當沿此界綫、搆築防禦公事、以加强蘇聯對於德國之所處地位、據此間外交界人士談稱、在此種情形之下、德國利於儘速解決波蘭問題、否則蘇聯或將憑藉其所造成之新的優勢、繼續向德國提出要求、職是之故、各外國觀察家以爲、德元首希特勒在向英法兩國提出和議之前、或願先與蘇聯成立同盟條約、俾英法兩國、他日拒絕和議時、德國可無後顧之憂、再則土耳其外長薩拉茹格魯芷在此間、與莫洛托夫進行談判、里賓特洛浦之突然來蘇、或欲有以影響此項談判、並慫恿蘇聯壓迫土國、使與西歐各民治國相疏遠、此層亦屬可能云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特、本日午後五時三十分、自該國京城乘坐飛機再來此間、同行者除該國駐公使當奧古斯特外、尙有法學家兩人、一爲該國衆院議長兼塔法學院敎務長鳥洛資、一爲國際公法專家畢浦敎授、聞抵此之後、當與蘇聯當局簽訂協定、藉以消釋蘇聯方面對於愛沙尼亞國中立所抱之疑慮、至於該國獨立地位能保持至於何種程度、尙無所聞、所可知者、「外國潛水艇在波羅的海出沒」問題、此前已不復談及、又據某方消息、德國駐蘇大使館海軍參贊、已於昨日前往愛沙尼亞國京城、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>丹麥　據政治　　　、愛沙尼亞代表團由愛國外長塞爾特率領、定今日飛莫斯科、蘇聯已要求愛國訂新商約、並利用波羅的海一港、大約係沃塞爾或巴爾迭斯基、作爲海軍根據地、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>立陶宛京城　關於愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特突然離城、及該國總理即訪問莫斯科一事、據此間探悉、蘇俄政府欲與愛沙尼亞締結廣大之政治經濟協定、其中條款之一、爲蘇俄要求在愛沙尼亞港口建立自由港區、蘇俄得在該區駐兵、以保護蘇俄利益云、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特日昨前來此間、與外交人民委員長莫洛托夫一度會談之後、忽忽賦歸、乃該國駐蘇俄公使雷奧古斯特、復於今晨返國、據聞此行乃欲使雙方現行談判加速進行、此在各外國觀察家則謂、塞爾特外長之來、正與本年三月間捷克總統哈嘉之前往德國貝許特斯伽登鎭接受德方要求、如出一轍、外傳莫洛托夫曾向塞爾特提出若干項要求、其性質等於哀的美頓書故也、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　據此間接獲之可靠方面消息、愛沙尼亞外長此次忽忽前往莫斯科之故、在蘇聯要求愛沙尼亞立即解除芬蘭　中三島嶼上之武裝與砲台所致、聞此三島在地理上、足以扼制列寗格勒之咽喉、故其武裝化、爲蘇聯所深忌、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>芬蘭京城　此間官方對於蘇聯行將抗議埃倫特島之武裝計劃之消息、雖認爲一種謠傳、不足置信、但中立人士皆謂、蘇聯在波羅的海之勢力、最近顯已大見增加、同時埃倫特島在波羅的海戰爭中握有樞要地位、故蘇聯對於此一問題之要求解決、爲期或不在遠、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據今日此間消息、蘇聯政府已獲得德政府之同意、將東巴爾幹各國劃入蘇聯勢力範圍以內、致使各界對愛沙尼亞·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞之命運、發生憂慮、據愛京塔林傳來消息、愛外長賽爾特將於星期三再赴莫斯科、與蘇聯方就商蘇愛之「緊張關係」、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>土外長滯留蘇京雙方談話至融洽</p>
<p>莫斯科蘇聯人民委員長會議主席兼人民外交委員長莫洛托夫昨日在克林姆宮接見土國外長薩拉柯格魯、陪賓有土國駐蘇大使亞克恭·蘇聯人民外交副委員長波丹金·台卡諾卓夫·及蘇聯駐土大使台倫鐵夫、嗣後薩氏由土大使陪伴、復晉見蘇聯最高議會主席團主席加里寗、同主席團書記戈爾金及蘇聯駐土大使台倫鐵夫亦在場作陪、同日莫洛托夫邀請薩氏及共隨員與土國駐蘇大使館員司午餐、蘇方要人作陪者有伏洛希羅夫·米柯楊·波丹金·台諾卓夫·洛卓夫斯基·戈爾金·台倫鐵夫等、席間莫薩兩氏會互致祝辭（二十七日塔斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　土耳其駐蘇聯大使館、今午爲該團外長薩拉茹格魯設宴洗塵、在座幷有蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫·國防人民委員長伏洛希羅夫上將·及外交人民委員會高級官員多人、按薩拉茹格魯外長到此之後、與昨日午後與晚間與莫洛托夫外交委員長先後晤談三次、經過情形聞頗良好、薩拉茹格魯外長原定於明晚首途返國、茲因德外長里賓特洛浦應蘇聯政府之邀、當於本日到途此間、解決「波蘭時局所引起之各項問題」、故蘇土兩國閣員明日無暇進行談話、而薩拉茹格魯外長之歸期、亦不得不展緩、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蘇羅關係無隔閡保持中立爲基礎</p>
<p>羅京外傳蘇聯與羅馬尼亞兩國關係緊張、蘇聯軍隊之開抵羅國邊境附近者、曾與羅國邊防軍發生糾紛多起云云、此間官方人士頃加以否認、指爲純出虛搆、並謂蘇羅兩國邊境交通如常、雙方邦交乃以中立政策爲基礎、彼此毫無隔閡、蘇聯軍事當局之現在波蘭南部邊境者、尤能對於羅國保持完全中立態度云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　聞蘇聯已重申尊重羅國中立之保證、官場與非官場各界對於蘇聯在比薩拉比亞（舊屬俄國歐戰後判歸羅國）將有異動之說、皆表示驚異、蘇聯近已在沿尼斯特河界綫建築防禦工事、並增厚該處兵力、而羅國遂亦增派防守比薩拉比亞以資防範、並在尼斯特河羅國境內趕築防綫、惟官場皆表示蘇聯不致有何惡意之希望、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯陳兵邊境　蘇愛關係緊張　蘇聯重視波潛艇逃逸事　對愛方解釋仍未能滿意</h3>
<p>莫斯科　此間無綫電臺於昨晚廣播消息、略謂蘇聯軍隊已在愛沙尼亞邊境集中、故而北俄紅軍業已適合戰時褊制、又據官方電臺廣播稱、蘇聯艦隊正在俄國與芬蘭之間往來游弋、至於白海方面之艦隊亦已「因環境而獲得新職務」、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　關於波蘭潛水艇一艘、自愛沙尼亞塔林港逃逸事、愛沙尼亞政府作解釋、蘇聯政府認爲求能滿意、並堅稱此一潛艇在愛沙尼亞港修繕竣事之後、業已駛入芬蘭灣云云、因此蘇愛爾國間局勢已趨嚴重化、愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特　來此間、其故即在於此、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　塔斯社本日發表關於蘇聯與愛沙尼亞談判經過公報一件如下、</p>
<p>「關於被扣於塔林港內之波蘭潛艇一艘逃逸無蹤一事、愛沙尼亞政府提出之解釋、殊不能令人滿意、執是之故、蘇愛兩國乃從事談判、以期決定步驟、俾保障蘇聯領海之安全、並防止潛匿波羅的海之外國潛艇之別動行爲、據愛國政府解釋、上述波蘭潛艇開入愛國領海時、「機件曾有損壞、動作亦不靈活、果爾則受損如此之潛艇、何以能避脫監視兵士耳目、逃出愛國首都港口、殊屬費解、準此、該潛艇在塔林港內會經修理完好、並經添裝燃料、俾能自行逃逸、實屬大有可能、</p>
<p>「又據列寗格拉發來消息、本日在盧加彎內兩處地方、曾發現不明國籍潛艇之瞭望鏡、由此當可斷信愛沙尼亞海岸附近某處、必設有不明國籍潛艇之秘密根據地、綜合上述情事觀之、保障蘇聯領海安全及防止潛艇別勵行爲之問題、自屬非常重要也、（二十八日塔斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　據此間接獲莫斯科之廣播報告稱、關於愛沙尼亞故　　「奧塞爾」號　　、蘇聯已向愛沙尼亞提出哀的美頓審、惟此間德外部與宜傳部對於此訊、諉爲不知、按波蘭潛艇「奧塞爾」號、曾入愛沙尼亞塔林港修理、據瑞典方面消息，在一星期前、曾在愛沙尼亞守兵二名護送之下逸去、航至瑞典沿海、始將愛兵二名、於一小舟中放回、惟據愛沙尼亞方面稱、該潛艇逃去時、愛兵曾予以射擊、但不久即潛行水中、其後雖派飛機軍艦快艇追逐打擊、皆無結果、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>愛沙尼亞塔林港　愛沙尼亞陸軍總司令昨日無綫電廣播中聲稱、愛沙尼亞若遭他國攻擊時、則決奮起而與之周旋、以維護愛沙尼亞之獨立、愛沙尼亞因不欲捲入此次歐戰中、惟他國若向愛沙尼亞進攻、則愛沙尼亞惟有與之奮戰、一如二十年前之所爲也（二十七美聯電）</p>
<p>拉脫維亞京城　愛沙尼亞政府因蘇愛商務談判之停頓、於昨日午後在愛沙尼亞京城舉行會議、由總統貝特斯擔任主席、愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特亦向議會兩院聯席會議提出報告、但內容如何、迄今尚未宣布、據官方宣稱、外長塞爾特偕同愛沙尼亞駐蘇公使雷氏及國際政治委員會之烏魯斯敎授與費浦敎授、定與今容前往莫斯科、與蘇聯繼續談判、關於談判中止由於蘇聯經過愛沙尼亞京城之轉口貿易問題之傳說、似已證實、官方前望於今日正式宣布眞相、（廿七日海通電）</p>
<h3>德準備對英法　採取和平攻勢　倘再被拒絕當不辭一戰自謂備有武器可操勝算</h3>
<p>瑞士國巴塞爾城　「國民日報」駐柏林訪員頃來電稱「德國官場人士咸謂、德國將在三日內採取「和平攻勢」、目前問題厥爲德國是否能與英法兩國講和、抑或須在西綫實行主力戰、蓋德國雖不願長期戰爭、但英法兩國若確無和意、則亦不得不以全力周旋、此項問題德國方面亟願獲取答案也」、云、</p>
<p>（廿七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>荷京　洛特丹城日報頃登載柏林消息稱、德國半官方面與報界咸稱、德國所可提出之和平建議、若被拒絕、即將以全力與英國作戰、不稍顧忌、該國各報並稱、「德國備有一種武器、迄未使用、一俟迫不獲已時、即當使用之、其破壞力量至爲偉大、足以獲致決定的效果」、此所謂武器殆指一種新發明的毒瓦斯炸彈而言、亦未可知云、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　德國各報近日登載消息、每謂比國行將在外交上有所發動、以冀挽回歐洲和平、此間政界人士頃加以評論云、據荷蘭各報載稱、德國元首希特勒或常在短時期內、依據現行局勢、向西歐各民治國提出和議、但此項和議絕無接受之望、然則德報所云、比國行將如何如何者、殆係試探性質而已云、（廿六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>德外長　聘蘇目標</p>
<p>英報紛加揣測</p>
<p>倫敦　關於德國外長里賓特洛浦二次聘問莫斯科事、英國各報均甚表示驚異、究其眞意安在、太多提出兩種解釋、一說德國對於蘇聯之逐漸向巴爾幹半島伸張勢力、甚感不安、因而亟願與蘇聯政府立即成立妥協、另有一說、則謂此乃德國在向英法兩國提出和議前之一種策略、觀於土耳其外長薩拉茹格魯之與里賓將洛浦同時抵達蘇聯、足見第」、說不爲無因、但觀於德國軍隊集中西綫、財又似與第二說相脗合、究竟孰是孰」非、此際猶難斷言、「每日郵報載稱、「某某方面相信里賓特洛浦此行眞正目標、乃在會同蘇聯當局商計一種和平方案、可使英法兩國感覺滿意、同時並保全希特勒之顏面、特巴爾幹半島各國之命運恐亦牽涉在內、「泰晤士報」登有胜立陶宛邊」界訪員之報告、關於里賓特洛浦外長之赴莫斯科、謂「新軸心」政策（指柏林莫期科軸心）推行以還、德國政府頗多失望之處、乃於東歐洲方面之各項問題、不得不介圖延宕云、「每日快報」載稱、「希特勒元首不日將向吾人採取和平攻勢、渠與各重要閣員最近散處各地、昨日均趕回柏林、今日齊集國務院舉行重要會議、揆德國政府之意、乃欲威脅英法兩國接受該國之建議、而里賓特洛浦外長則於此土耳其外長薩拉茹格魯聘問蘇聯之時、趕赴莫斯科、是亦故弄玄虛、意在使人相信、德蘇土三國正謀締結秘密協定、幷瓜分巴爾幹半島與近東、同時、德蘇兩國則擬瓜分波羅的海沿岸各國、實則此種和平攻勢及其在西綫集中軍隊之舉、適足以證明德國已屆山窮水盡之境地而已、「德國倘欲賡續作戰、計惟有侵入羅馬尼亞而向黑海推進、「但德國茲若在西綫採取攻勢、則其實義即係德國軍事當局諗知向東甫間推進之路、已被蘇聯阻隔、故不得不轉而西進」、「新聞紀事報」載稱、「蘇聯在經濟上控制巴爾幹半島之企圖日益積極、此爲希特勒元首所寢　不安、爰決定遣派里賓特洛浦外長前往莫斯科、設法加以阻止、或謂德國方面夙以爲波蘭瓜分　事之後、史丹林即擬提出和平建議、此次里賓特洛浦外長殆懇勸史丹林、謂提出和議之時期業已蒞臨、亦未可知、特不論如何、蘇德兩國本日談話對於西綫戰事必有重要影響、則可斷言、外傳德蘇兩國或將締結軍事條約、此說殆難實現、蓋蘇聯現在推行自利政策、彼在任何方面均未感受威脅、德國則因與央法兩國作戰之故、無暇旁顧、蘇聯倘與之成立軍事條約、實屬無利可言也（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐戰與世界經濟的破壞</h3>
<p>歐洲戰事自德國宣稱東綫戰事業已結束之後，已進入新的階段。德國原來希望於擊敗波蘭之後，使英法喪失其對德作戰的目標，再由第三方面從中斡旋，以期獲得和平的勝利；不料養國首相墨索里尼「戰事局部化和大戰尙未爆發」的界說，未能爲英法所接受；於是西綫的戰事，乃隨之而漸趨劇烈。就目前的戰爭局勢而論，法國有馬奇諾防綫，德國有西格菲防綫，皆是堅强可守，除非是那一方面願意破壞了其他國家的中立，絕不會輕易獲得深入的機會；因此之故，勢必相持，而成趨向於長期戰爭的局勢。</p>
<p>現代的戰爭，乃是軍事政治和經濟的綜合戰鬥。將這三種力量比較起來，在速戰速決的戰略中，軍事和政治最爲重要；但在長期戰爭中，經濟却是決定的因素。例如歐洲第一决大戰中德國的失敗，就是由於經濟的過度貧困。目前的歐戰，究竟是吾需要長期戰爭，能吾從軍事和政治方面獲得速戰速決的結果，我們不必遽加推測；但在經濟方面，各國確已開始長期戰爭的進行。英國已對德國實施海上封鎖，並實行截留戰時禁止品；德國也已用潛艇施行反封鎖政策。這種對抗的鬥爭方法，開始便極激烈，和第一决歐戰的末期不相上下。現在雖然各方面都正在作「你不能餓死我」的豪語；而初步的戰果，實際上已發生相當的效力：德國曾經指責英國封鎖政第爲對婦孺的不人道的作戰；日咋英首相也爲抵制德國潛艇，籲請全國作長時期的經濟戰，這都是已深切感覺到戰爭壓迫的表示。</p>
<p>現時英法德國內的實際經濟活動究竟怎樣，因其有關軍事秘密，自不能爲外人所知；惟就其對外貿易狀態看來，三國都是工商業非常發達的國家，所以在對外貿易上，輸入以食料與原料品爲最多，輸出則以製造品占大部分；允其是英德兩國的情形，此較更爲相似。過去英國原料與食品的輸入，常占總輸入的百分之八十左右；製造品輸出，也當占總輸出的百分之七五上下。　　原料舉　　的輸入，製造品的輸出，也都在輸入或輸出總額的百分之八十以上。英德各重視其海外的商業，故各以破壞對方的海外商業為最重要的經濟戰略。唯其這樣，以後封鎖和反封鎖的鬥爭，勢必愈演而愈烈：遭受影響的，將不僅是參戰各國本身，甚至全世界的人類，都要遭受重大的影響。</p>
<p>這次參加歐戰的國家，到現在爲止，還祇有英、法、波、德四國：蘇聯一入波蘭戞然而止，還算不是交戰國；現存的敵對態度，祗有英法與德國。以後是吾還有其他國家參加戰團，目前尙難預料；不過根據過去的事實，經濟的原因，常爲參戰的原因。假如雙方經濟戰爭的範圍逐漸擴大，將來難免沒有其他國家自動或被動的加入戰團。英法德等國最近曾再三聲明保證鄰國的中立，並宣稱將遵照國際法的作戰方式；不過現代的保證諾言，根本上已成爲一種說謊的方式；而國際法也祗是國際社會公認的一種人道正義的思想表現，實際上並沒有强制的制裁力量，這又怎能阻止戰爭的野蠻行動呢？例如德國的潛艇政策，其活動的範圍，不僅在英法及其屬地的周圍，甚至遠及中南美的海岸；其對於海上交通的破壞，不僅是擊沉英法的商船，連其他中立國家的航輪，也再三的被牠轟炸。又如英國的截留戰事禁止品，對於中立國的商輪，都須經過英國軍艦的檢查；此外如經過中立國的轉口貿易，也有間接的限制。如日昨德國就對各中立國發出警吿，要求中止對英法的商務往來。這種種鬥爭方式的不斷演出，勢必使歐戰的範圍擴大，這是可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>若就歐洲經濟戰爭對於世界經濟的影響而言：英法德都是在世界貿易上占極重要地位的國家。以過去三國本身貿易的數額來說，的占世界貿易額的百分之三十左右；並且以海上交通的困難，和非參戰國的絕對保持中立，遭受打擊的將不是英法德三國，而必爲全歐洲甚至全世界的貿易。歐洲的貿易額過去的佔世界貿易總額百分之五十以上；全世界的貿易中，有百分之五十以上停止活動，這將使全世界失去生產和消費的正常關係。戰爭將破壞歐洲的經濟活動，自然也能破壞歐洲以外各地的經濟生機：並且牠的影響所及，不僅是現在而將遠及於將來。戰爭已經是流血的殘殺，經濟恐慌　將成為慢性的屠戮</p>

<h3>兩次歐戰的比較觀　（續）  陳楚祥</h3>
<p>英國地位始終無甚差異、因與歐陸隔開、海軍强大、除空襲外、不致受其他侵略、故兩次均派兵赴法助戰、（其實、英干預歐洲戰事、也有她的傳統路綫、就是依她的優越地形和海軍的力量、足以保衛本國不受敵人侵入、同時又能輸送軍隊到歐陸作戰、拿破嵛之敗於聯軍可以參證、現在空軍力量雖然縮短了英吉利海峽的距離、但空軍不能佔領土地、英國幾年來以空軍發展和防空設備、又在急起直追中、受威脅的程度自然又减小了）、</p>
<p>現在波蘭軍隊已被打得七零八落、華沙陷落、大約亦不過時間問題、（截至寫本文時爲止、華沙仍在波軍扼守中）本來據英法和中立國軍事家的評論、都以爲照波蘭的地形、抵抗德國已很算盡力、德波接壤一千九百公里之處、波蘭並没有像法德邊境的堅固防綫、地勢上都是便於機械化部隊行動的原野、他們以爲波蘭在這種情形下應該撤退、縮短陣綫、在亢旱天氣轉變後憑着有利地勢、再圆反攻、他們舉出一九二〇年波蘭對蘇俄作戰、撤退六百哩、終在華沙一戰、得到全勝的故事、以爲波蘭幾千輛坦克車、日後仍可大顯身手、所以他們的結論是、德軍不容易在短時期内把波蘭的抵抗完全摧毁、却不料蘇聯會突然出兵、波軍終於一敗塗地了、</p>
<p>西綫方面、德國完全放棄了一九一四年的攻势而疊欢聲明「人不犯我我不犯人、」至於採攻勢的法軍、也不過是略在法德防綫之間的無人地帶施行局部攻擊、稍有進展而已、法軍的主要目的、還在探騐齊格飛防綫弱點所在、预備日後聯合英軍進攻、法軍事專家雖稱齊格飛防綫是倉卒趕成、不足與法國辛苦經營費一百四十億美金的馬其諾防綫可比、但是上次歐戰中的　登堡陣綫、還是在戰時趕築的、直到德軍力竭時、恊約國才能踏進、雖然現在的進攻戰器比以前的進步、但是現在的防禦工具、又何嘗不然呢、兩年前、中國軍隊在上海還能支持三月、可見一斑了、以此而諭、法軍在未得可靠把握、及等英軍開到、力量雄厚時、總不會貿然發動大规模的進攻的、這一點、與上次德國進攻法國也並無二致、當時德以與法交界處已築有防綫、進攻不易、遂强制假道於比、除了德參謀部估計比利時的力量過低一錯以外、德又何嘗不是審愼從事呢、上次德在比境未能完全逹到預定目的、而俄軍却大擧進攻東普魯土、不得不調一部分軍隊東返、坦能保一役、固然摧毁了俄軍進攻力量、但西綫右翼的力量却大爲减弱、且分布過大、因之反予霞飛集中大軍配合英軍的機會、瑪恩一役、霞飛把德軍趕回爱森、德國人自己亦不能不承認那是上次大戰的轉點、這次德軍藉蘇聯夾攻之力、先從從容容解決波籣、然後再專心對付英法、實在是方便多了、所可憂慮的是、蘇聯究竟能否不再變卦、</p>
<p>上次英國對德用封鎖手段、這次並無例外、同樣的、上次英國商輸受德潛艇破壞最大、最近幾天來、英國商輸又是德潛艇政策的唯一目標、這原是傅統的和地形的因素使然、並無可以奇異之處、本次德國海軍總噸数只及英四分之一、在量的比例上，較上次要弱一半、她的潛水艇、據說還不到上次的半数、所以在海軍的比較方面、英法是認爲她們佔有絕對優勢的、她們目前的問题、只是在阻止德國的海上運輸、攻擊德國的潛艇、同時實行軍艦護送商輪法、確保他們本身海上交通的安全、和加緊封鎖、箝制對方、我們如希望雙方海軍有什麼對陣的會　、從上次歐戰四年中海軍大戰僅尼德蘭一役、而其結果、至今仍英德各持一說、眞相不明、一事觀之、大槪是會失望的、在陵地上、英國要達到上次參戰的實際行動、自不能不再運送軍隊和軍需品到法助戳、英國飛機在進龔方面、因多少總要顧到距離的限制、當然很可能的會停留一部分在法、除了戰塲上的行動外、英帝國還對德断絕一切商業往來、這種經濟戰爭、就是封鎖政策的主因、這一封鎖綫、现在不及上次的完整、德國覺得现在東面巳與蘇聯携手、東南諸小國又均守中立、與上次遭受封鎖的情形、完全不同、引以爲慰、將來的演變與其利害情形、究竟若何、暫時不能逆覩、根據「旁觀者清」的話法、日本軍事家評論希特勒是「陵地人物」、忽略英法海軍的決勝力一語、與英帝國自治領地都參加這次戰事參看、或有其存在的價値、附帶在此可以提起的、宣傳戰在上次差不多到末期才進展很快、本次未開戰前、德國即一贯的秉承去年作風、在報章上滿載波人虐待德人的消息，戰事剛起、荚機亦兩次飛德擲下九百萬份傳單、他如英國發表準備三年以上的戰爭、德國宣當作戰十年，除去眞正的決心外、又何嘗不带有宣傳戰的作用、至如所傳德蘇義日締四國同盟、更是報紙上登大字的好材料、坦克車在上次戰事中、方發明應用、現在戰事剛起、即傳法國六百輛坦克車衝薩爾區、他如空軍的進步、法德間的堅强堡壘、英國自稱防潛艇的新法、及其他一切戰器戰術的應用、當更非上次所可比擬、</p>
<p>好像義大利直到現在尚未加入戰事一樣、本文對於她還没有提到、幾年來的轴心政策、和締結未久的兩國軍事同盟、早使一般人抱着集權國和民主國、或侵略陣綫和和平陣綫、兩大壁壘的劃分觀念、戰事剛起、德國居然通知義大利不需要她的軍事帮助、而據路透社所傳、墨索里尼廣播、明白指摘德國在他忙着尋求和平解决但潬方案時、告以擬即從事武力、以致他不得不斷定德國遠犯了義德間的諒解、因此他以前所擔當的責任、也不再有束縛的性質、如上面所傳的消息果屬確實、就文字的表面上看、我們試拿他和一九一四年義國外長所宜稱的「奥國作戰含有侵略目標、與純粹防禦性質的三國同盟不合、在此情形下義國保守中立」一語相比、不能不覺得有「異曲同工」之妙、现在在事實方面、義大利至少已暂時保守中立、而且據傳、她舆法接境處巳重加開放、對外航運亦恢復了、她將來的趨向如何、實在是一個歐陛各國最所重視的問题、最近報載德義間外交接觸頻繁、英法對她亦大獻慇懃、義大利究将何處去呢、她是不是亦像上次正在等待機會、討價還價、還是眞的和德國另有秘密約定、待德在波全勝後、再出來調停呢、近二三年來、義大利爲她這位盟弟所利用、委實盡了不少力量、而實際上自己聲勢反不及以前的煊赫，墨索里尼現在能跳出戰爭漩渦、被許爲歐陸最無錯覺的现實政治家、難道他能隨便放過這個機會嗎、蘇聯居然肯和德國實行携手正和上次帝俄爲塞爾維亞毅然撑腰的態度相反、雙方交换的條件如何、實大有一問的價値、她如果想在歐洲恢復舊領土、除了訂結所謂瓜分波蘭的蘇德密約外、對於波羅的海三小國和羅馬尼亞的巴薩比亞、大槪也不會忘懷罷、她现在的領土、足够她將來的開闢、且巳致力於此、以後還是着重於國內的發展、還是着重在恢復沙皇時代的欧洲地位呢、丹京會傳德蘇義日四强同盟的消息什九是宣傳的烟幕作用吧、試問她剷去英法、换以德義日、還不是「以暴易暴」嗎、克林姆宮的要人們對於臨時容串和正式下海兩者間的利害關鍵、不會没有詳細的考慮吧、</p>
<p>環繞德國邊境的小國、現在都守中立、和二十五年前、歐戰由奧塞之争而起、門的尼哥羅立耶加入協約、和比利時被武力假道而抗德的局勢似乎有些不同、不過當時戰爭初起、其他各小國也都守中立、和現在沒有多大差別、現在各小國的趨向如何、德國極力關切她已有提出警告、說她們如有任何不穩的傾向、即當以敏捷的行動對付之、依目前的局势看、各小國在沒有打死老虎的把握時、力量究　微小、大約不會主觀的捲入戰爭　渦的、西班牙目前亦守中立、這個疲憊巳極瘡痰未復的獨裁國、對她的盟兄將有什麼報答、因她的地理形勢、極足重視、然而利害參半的一般小國所最痛苦的、就是她們的地理位置、時常要引起諸交戰國對於她們中立的破壞、即如比利時飛機被英擊落、荷蘭希臘遭受無妄之災、性質的嚴重、固然不及一九一四年比利時的中立被破壞、而共處境之苦、實可謂不相上下、</p>
<p>再從各小國回說到交戰的主體國來、在德國人的眼中、英國最爲他們所痛恨、正和上次大戰初起時他們痛恨法國一樣、現在的法國、德國却說她受英支配、盲目的跟她走、這種論調、除去外交作用外、是否尚有其他可能的解釋呢、英法會屡次宣稱、決不聽德國在波蘭造成旣成事實的情形下進行和議、但現在那斯拉夫族的大哥哥（蘇聯）居然出來硬撑一下腰、英法不免有些狼狽吧、上次大戰爆發時、壁壘的劃分比较顯明、现在即暂定義大利和美國仍處與以前相若的地位、而加　了蘇聯和日本後、國際局势、即頓呈「迷亂」了、英法與蘇聯在歐洲和在遠東的關係、蘇聯和德國的關係、德日的關係、日英·日蘇的關係、其間的縱横開闔、取捨去從、眞是「五花八門」洋洋大觀、要將這些關係和其歸宿作源源本本的解答、恐怕祗有「時間」能够勝任罷、</p>

<h3>歐戰聲中上海之洋行　洋貨價格高昂乏人問津因此營業清淡一落千丈  一栗</h3>
<p>自從歐戰的序幕揭開後，本市工商業首先呈現杌陧不安的情形，此地姑不論正是國貨產業發展的機會，然此時受影響最烈的，莫如英·法·德·商洋行。　洋行在一般人的心目中，一向是被人看得起的，因爲洋行業務簡單，它祗不過是一個買賣的中間人，每年總能得到一筆很大的盈餘，他們的職員，職務輕　，而收入豐富（比一般情形）、　可是滬戰後，洋行的業務似乎逐漸在衰落，當時因運輸上的不便利，洋貨的價格便增高、近來因外匯一再緊縮，洋貨物價，更形高漲，表面看起來，這時期　的洋行又可大發其財。其實并不如此，因爲洋貨上漲到了這般田地，顧客購貨已具戒心，而洋行的營業方針，反比戰前認真。本年洋行定貨，依一般情形講，付二成定銀足夠，甚至可以不到二成。近來則不然，每定一貨品，非先付六成定銀不可，交貨的時間又長久、顧客在這種情形下，可用國貨替代的，就採用國貨，可用舊的，也就省省了。　目前歐戰　爆發，英法德等國行駛遠東的商輪，已形停頓，上海英法德商洋行的歐貨來源不暢，於是洋行的營業，受到一個莫大的打擊。對於顧客已訂立的定貨契約，有宣告取消的售貨以上海現存的貨品爲限，但商人大多懷著一種居奇得心裡，因爲見到第一次歐戰的先例，好多小商人都變了暴富戶。目前有顏料，五金，呢絨，工業原料，機件等現貨的，均不願脫售，存心觀望。以致飛黃騰達的高漲，越是漲，囤積居奇越是起勁，然而事實上，只聽見高價，卻看不見購貨的顧客。要知道洋貨早已少人問津，在目前畸形的局面下，當然更不容談了。　在昨天晚上一個宴會席上，遇見一位德商洋行的買辨。等者乘便詢他進來洋行的營業，他舉了一個五金例子說：「五金的價格，較戰前已漲起一二倍的光景，可是生意做不開，銷本市一隅爲大宗。所以營業情形，遠不如戰前，眼前，歐戰　發生，洋貨囤積居奇，更少買客，營業的每況愈下，是必然的結果。」他再說：「德商洋行，已　於停頓狀態中，現正設法應付的對策　此外還受到一個意外的打擊，就是德商提取存款的問題，我們的一位經理與某英商銀行的經理，爲多年至交，會爲提取去　項，　知那位銀行經理直截爽快的說：友誼歸友誼，在今日之下，友誼只可撇開不講，日籌戰事解決再說罷！西人的愛團，可以　見。」　誠然，一向被人看的起的洋行業，到了這時，卻遭到可慘的厄運，目前上海礦渠僅存的一部份洋貨，價格固然長得可以驚人，顧客願意採用的　意還是極少數，只不過做了投機商的工具而已！中國人趁此時機，正可努力製造國產商品，替代昂貴的外國貨品，減少人超，在國家財政上是亟有意義的。</p>

<h3>走法不同  金葉</h3>
<p>「戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同」，這原則喻之走路，亦何嘗不然。</p>
<p>愚者的行路，往往會走到牛角尖裏去。何以弄到如此地步，也有幾個原因：不是眼睛有些近視：那末定是沈眠未醒，不把瞳子挨開。糊裏糊塗，一生一世的瞎摸，以至於越鐵　越深，越深越小，進了狹的天地里。如果能夠暁得自己已在碰壁，斷崖勒馬，那未還有希望。要是祇管朝裏猛走，則前　不堪設想了，最後，必然地同尖點相撞鳴呼完結。這種人物用市井上所流行的語句來獎勵他，就是所謂：「屈死，自作　，代，儂眼睛也勿生格。」</p>
<p>其次，比較高明點了，他能知道（不是認識）世間有路（並不向牛角尖）他確實張開眼可以挨着現成的道路行走。然而，他是相當懶惰，只知道利用現成，這樣，一旦遇到高山闊水，或者路之盡頭（並不是眞正的終點，僅僅乎某一皆段的結束）於是他就徬徨起來，現成的路是沒有了。要是他幕傲荘子上講原始人民遇到所謂：「當是時也，出無蹊隧，澤無舟梁」，因而馬上可以打回票（晋日思想簡單，人類也稀少。）然而如今却不行，後来者早把来的路塞没，豈容許你打回票呢？唯一的結果，就是被擠出路途，以嗚呼來結束。當然嘍！這種人也是不足爲訓的。</p>
<p>能伸直身子，站得穩的，那末究竟怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>假使一個人並不是瞎子，而目還能知道世間有着現成的路，是不夠的。他必須認識（不是單純的知道）路之過去歷史，產生原因；並且能夠把所致現今所走的路；與明白自己要創造行走的路，這樣，才不會目埋，也不會被擠出，不幸，偶而他們未能終途，但精神却長存，畢竟有着成績，讓後來者可以直追。這種人可以稱爲「前時的拓荒者。」</p>
<p>爲了拓荒者需要開展和創造新路，所以世間的路就沒有休止的時候，它能向左向右，或高或低地迤　着，向前進行。</p>
<h3>馬奇諾防綫巡禮  憶元節譯</h3>
<p>在一九一四年，法軍醉心於採取攻勢的戰略，而蔑視那種憑藉深溝高壘以從事防禦的方法。其後大戰爆發，起初法軍死傷慘重，這可說是上面錯誤觀念的必然的悲慘後果。</p>
<p>自從得到了這番敎訓以後，法軍對於邊陲的防務，不再依賴士兵們血肉之軀，而只憑藉優越的火力與三和土凝成的實體了。根據大戰的經騐，他們已看到把米力適當地配合，掩護起來才能發揮極大的防禦價値。馬廳諾防綫便是這個理論登　造極的表現。</p>
<p>浩大的工程</p>
<p>馬奇諾防綫真可稱是本世紀偉業之一。只要略舉幾個簡單的數字，便足以表示牠工程的浩大。據一個會當過監工的長官告訴我：在一九二九至一九三六年間，從地下掘出的泥土，約有一千二百萬立方密逹；用三和土凝成的人造石，約有一百五十萬立方密逹；鋼板約用五萬噸；雇工約有一萬五千人；挖成的隧道，如果成一直綫，有從巴黎到太陽那麼的距離；全部工程耗去的經費，共計七十億金法郎。可是這個建造工作，永無完成的止境，牠的防禦工事，還在　續不斷的增强中。</p>
<p>擊不穿的堅壁</p>
<p>在上次大戰中，凡爾登堡壘，雖遭受大砲数千發轟擊，可是十八座三和土凝成堡壘中，倒有十三座完好無恙。所以在建造防綫以前，工程師對於建成凡爾登堡壘的物質，光作精密的研究。他們認爲只有像凡爾登那樣三和土建築物，才適合建造防綫的條件。</p>
<p>可是他們選不認爲滿意，又作進一步的實騐，以確定三和土層，鋼板層，泥土該有多厚，他們用500mm。大口徑的短程榴彈砲，對特建的堡壘轟擊，以試騐牠是不否經得起在同一點擊中三顆砲彈。而且在實際建造時，還將外層加厚三倍。這些深入地下的巨塔，每座足有一百二十噸重量，都是整塊兒建成的，任憑任用多大的砲彈，決不能擊穿牠的堅壁。</p>
<p>內部的設備</p>
<p>馬諾內部，裝置着電機，使內部的氣壓略高於外部，所以防毒氣的滲入，砲塔中的大砲裝置在球形的砲座上，可以旋轉自如。砲口鑲嵌在鋼板裏，以免與外面的有毒空氣流通。砲兵駕馭他們的砲時，恰如兵艦上的水手，完全看不見外面的東西，只憑軍官用羅盤指示他們動作。運用裝置在鋼板裏的反射望遠鏡，軍官們把外界，看得清清楚楚。他們依據打好格子的地圖，確定射擊目的。</p>
<h3>雨的日子  金芒</h3>
<p>街道穿起稿素，</p>
<p>天飄忽着涙絲；</p>
<p>涙絲刺上熱刺刺的人底臉，</p>
<p>睫毛晶瑩地閃着光。</p>
<p>這是什麼日子啊？</p>
<p>雨會告訴你；</p>
<p>街上，寂靜如「孝堂」的街上會告訴你。</p>
<p>雨把街道穿起縞業，</p>
<p>縞素的「喪服」罩着行人；</p>
<p>緘默的口給雨打得更緘默，</p>
<p>跳動的心却還是跳動的心！</p>
<p>微雨儘慘更慘淡吧，</p>
<p>讓市街蒙閉在黑暗裏—</p>
<p>黑暗的雲霧將轟起巨雷，</p>
<p>那時就來一陣大雨，</p>
<p>呌街道汪洋着洪水，</p>
<p>洪水將飄盡一切腐臭；</p>
<p>而縞素的喪服啊，</p>
<p>將在暴雨後徥天空脫去，</p>
<p>從市街脫去，</p>
<p>從人底跳動的心中脫去！</p>
<p>電話　保護得也　　間密，都埋藏在五密　　的石板下而，每一道　綫，至少有兩道岸備　。這些地下　　綱的終點，就是位置在一百五十呎深的電話局。局內設備，足以供給二萬五千架電話機的服務。</p>
<p>如果敵人侵入，一剎時間馬奇諾防綫區域，立刻爲一片火力所掩蓋。每一座暗砲簡直是一座火山，隨時準備向前後左右噴射牠的火焰。這還不夠，每一座暗砲臺上部建築，又爲輕機關槍火力綱所掩護。如果敵兵要想進估砲台的頂部，那末槍彈砲彈，頓時會從四面八方飛來，休想能前進一步。</p>
<p>戒備森嚴</p>
<p>在「馬奇諾」防綫區域內，哨兵站，警報處，反射望　鏡，聽音器，紅外綫掩護砲火等防　工具，眞可說是星　棋　，無論在白天，或是黑夜，到處有偵探的耳目窺伺著，到處有防禦的軍器準備著。我們到那裏去參觀，雖然事前會經公佈過，可是還不時有流動的哨兵，騎著機器脚踏車，尾隨着我們，監視我們一程。如果我們稍離預定的路途，立刻有兵士出現，把我們送歸原路。</p>
<p>在阿爾卑山區，所建築的防禦工程，眞夠呌人驚心動魄。在高聲雲表的岩石上　成了洞穴，彷彿是驚魔的栖巢。阿爾卑川的戍卒就駐守在那裏。當嚴寒的冬天，他們帳幕上的積書足有十來尺厚。</p>
<p>陸上的艦隊</p>
<p>打個　喻說，馬奇諾防綫</p>
<p>宛如一個　隊，寄碇於邊境上連綿的　山中。每個艦隊有斥候　，　任偵察的工作；防綫的前面也密佈　防舍，第座防舍有十二個兵士守望着。他們唯一的目的，在對敵人的攻擊作三日的抵制，使高級司令得以找出主要的進攻點。正如海軍作戰一般，斥候艦完成了他們任務以後，便向主力艦那邊撤退。馬奇諾防綫的主力艦，就是地下的堡壘。當防舍裏的斥候兵完成了他們的任務時，便山曲徑的隧道向堡壘撤退。防綫的區域，足有三十哩寬廣。縱目四望，只見小丘壘壘，底下隧道緃橫，彷彿是　鼠的洞穴。</p>
<p>建築工程的變化多端，是馬奇諾防綫的優點。建築物的大小旣各不相同，掩護的方法也是互異，使觀察者莫辨眞僞，從　芝到卑山岡，我會視察過三十座暗砲臺，簡直找不出雨座是模樣相同的。</p>
<p>地下的城堡</p>
<p>現在該講到馬奇諾防綫的主力艦了。牠簡直是一座極大的地下兵營。有幾英里長的通道，照着雪亮的電燈。舖設鐵軌，可以行駛火車，更有電氣通風裝置，冷熱水設備，以及廚房，宿舍。倉庫等等。倉庫裏儲藏的物品足供好幾個月的糧食。</p>
<p>警戒綫是凸出在地簡的，一如潛水艇的反射望鏡的升出水面。在警戒站中，有兵士日夜輪流防守着。如果发現敵人，立刻發出警報，接着輕機關槍就動作起來，便敵人不敢逼近暗砲台。同時暗砲台頂部，已一切準備定當，士兵行近砲塔，立刻放射起機關槍來。</p>
<p>除了防守的時間以外，士兵們唯一的工作，就是無休止的用鐵鏡掘着泥土。他們須得不時建造掩護工事，加强鐵絲網，照料「筍田」。所謂「筍」，其實是打入泥土裏的大鋼橋，尖端露出地面。這些鋼橋是打在一個斜坡上，高低不齊，所以阻止坦克車的進攻。當坦克車被擱置在鋼橋上時，平射砲便發揮牠的威力，從腹部擊燬這個爬行怪物。如果坦克車逃過了這道防綫，接着便遇到第二道鋼　防綫，筍尖上裝有機關，可以使地雷爆炸。這重難關，坦克車無論如何逃不過的</p>
<p>士兵的憇息所，「須有最大的舒適，最小的危險。」這是波丹將軍的一句名言，馬奇諾防綫已逹到了這個標準。全防綫士兵的辭世息所儘可能的遠離砲台。例如有一座堡壘，位置在一個山脚下；而士兵的憇息所却位置在山的另一邊，有六百呎長的隧道相通。在這樣的環境下，士兵自然是精神飽滿，活力充沛，不怕强敵的進攻了。而目在劇烈的戰爭中，如果一座砲臺被敵人侵入，那末通道中有活動的鋼門，可以重重關閉，使侵殘暴敵人只侷促於一部份，而不致危及整個堡壘。</p>
<p>（以上所述，只是對馬奇諾防綫的輸廓描繪。全文係根據比國軍事專家Robert　Leurquin的視察記寫成。許多地方描寫得不夠詳細明確，這或許是因爲事關軍事秘密，他有意寫得模糊彷彿吧。）</p>
<h3>深呼吸  史蒂</h3>
<p>—故　零拾—</p>
<p>深深呼吸吧！　清新爽澈的空氣。</p>
<p>可笑，自從糼小到離家的上幾個年頭裏，我無日不在這喪生活着，然而我至今才體會到鄉間空氣的可愛。</p>
<p>簡直有空谷裏飄渺的　蘭的芳香，山澗中溢出的泉水的廿冽。怎不？整日整夜地，婆婆於閃耀的漣漪，翻舞在田野的麦浪，含吮過葉尖晶瑩的露珠……　日整夜地在生命的蒼罩，能的色彩中；更充溢在荘　偉大，熱烈而鮮艷，生的搏門的關畫裏！</p>
<p>我詛咒都市，都市裏的烟，煤灰，泥塵，沙粒，炭酸，鸽籠……到處是觸鼻的惡臭，重濁的氛　。但我也讚美她，使我現在居然感受到了生命的威脅。</p>
<p>從醫生深度近視眼的二片玻璃裏，一雙嚴睿的目光，和撇　子下，滯重的語氣裏，我選擇了一條路，回到多年闊別的家園去！</p>
<p>於是每天，有我　巡在幾畦蔬菜中，迤　着一帶矮樹，伸向無邊的野迢遙的　道問，更臨着秋水一泓。</p>
<p>優展，我細數着天空的晨星，笑她耐不了暁風而戰慄；窺殘月一鉤，從烟囱上移到那邊的樹尖，待天色從青灰裏泛出淺紫，朝霞在　烟的柳樹下隱現；我又靜觀倒映在水中的青天，游魚唼含在雲邊。……</p>
<p>田野裏無邊的碧浪，幾椽茅舍點綴着綠海喪小鳥的孤寂，朝的烟霧似的迷茫裏，還寥落地散植着幾點黑影。我每天這般的　　；我每次都見這浮動着的幾點，（或許他們也見我這上點）這兒是我的崗位？那邊又是他們的哨線？</p>
<p>我似乎窺到了自然的秘密；我耍投身在大地的懹抱　，故　太美麗了！</p>
<p>有時有幾支槍聲劃着長空，我聞到米製氣味，比都市中的軋蘇林更刺激呢。</p>
<p>似乎窺到了生的眞諦，我深深地呼吸，像老　的貪慾，不願放過極微細的一點，不怕　把我的肺漲破，故閩的空氣眞太可愛了。</p>
<p>每天，有我　巡在幾畦疏菜中，……</p>
<p>我深深地呼吸……</p>

<h3>南洋華僑愛好國產影片</h3>
<p>— 雄劍</p>
<p>最近新加坡影業公司，有位代表胡秋甫君到上海來，接洽購買影片拷貝。前犬偶然在一個塲合遇見了，和他談起國產電影在南洋一帶的近况，</p>
<p>胡君謂，在南洋一帶，過去全是武俠片和神怪片的世界，只有這一類片子能買錢；及至抗戰以後，僑胞關懷祖國心緖異常熱烈，他們的目光也就轉變過來，希望能在銀幕上知道些祖國的近况和抗戰情形。他們的影業公司與童慶中央中國兩製片廠訂有合同，凡「中央」出品，無論新聞片，部頭片在南洋都婦他們公司所屬電影院首先放映，在過去，每部影片都很受僑胞的歡迎。</p>
<p>至於娛樂性影片，在南洋最受歡迎的當是古裝片，古裝片的取材大都爲通俗歷史故事，人物事實，早已家傳戶曉，老幼咸知，以前如「孟姜女」，「楚霸王」，「木蘭從軍」都極能吸引觀衆。而且古裝片均屬歷史事物，於現代政治社會很少關及處，在當地檢查礎關檢查時，也不會發生刪剪等事。</p>
<p>胡君來上海後，曾赴各影片公司參觀，順便接洽購買拷貝。他對各公司正在斷製中的幾部古裝片，都在接洽收買。關於以後上海如有相當佳片，則胡君已委託了導演吳邨，隨時於看過後知照。他還吿訴我，預備接洽幾部蘇聯片到南洋去放映呢。</p>
<h3>籃蘭女士談：　演劇史與「賽金花」（下）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄　筆錄藝人漫記　近兩年的工作</p>
<p>來滬後登台演戲，始於四十年代劇社公演「賽金花」時承乏克林德夫人一角；當下自己雖覺演得不甚滿意，而演據的興味却又大見濃厚起來。接着「生死戀」與「結婚」决第上演，叉都演了一位較重要的角色。此後「八一三」戰事發生，直至淞滬綫國軍西撤，很多藝壇同志即離滬遠去，自己就很想在沉寂的孤島劇壇上，儘可能底多做一些工作；到現在除於各劇社歷演「女子公寓」「日出」「梅蘿香」「愛與死的搏鬥」「花濺淚」諸劇外，又會導演過「慾魔」與「花濺淚」兩劇；這也是我初度的嘗試，當然談不到能有怎樣好的成績。</p>
<p>初嘗銀幕風味我很愛好電影，正和愛好話劇一樣；自己向來卻沒有拍演電影的意想。不久前藝華公司邀演「女子公寓」，經此一番嘗試，却已打起了我很大的與趣。我認爲電影與話劇是有其聯繫性的姊妹藝術；演電影自己能在銀幕上看到自己，從而改正自己的表演，確較演話劇更覺夠味，不過初决踏上攝影塲去時却甚感畏怯，那樣空空洞洞的情景，旣視表演話劇一上台去就有許多觀衆現在眼前不同；而拍演工作，每個鏡頭僅作片段表演，情感難爲一貫的表達，則又比不上演舞台劇那樣快意。</p>
<p>演賽金花感想這幾天，我正在璇宮劇院主演「賽金花」的工作。這個戲是採用熊佛西先生的劇本，而經過魏如晦先生重加改編的。爲了原作的時代性早與目前不同且兼適應此時此地的客觀環境起見，全劇在保持精彩下現經刪成四幕，內容所表演的也只僅以「一代名妓」一個人的一生事蹟變遷爲限。所有一切服裝道具及佈景，此次全承新華公司友誼租借，這實在是生色不少的極大助力。不過限於時間太匆了——廢曆中秋節就在　宮劇院上演。自己的戲或恐未能演得如何之好，我將很誠懇地接受各方面的批評與指敎。此外，我對賽金花這人的感想，以爲她生性很豪爽，而山於人生閱歷之豐富，對於事理上的觀察也來得非常淸楚。再就她在彼時聯軍入京下的紛亂情形而言，一　妓女却也只能如此做法　　她個人立塲上確是很對的；但將整個事實說來，還得希望觀衆能從大處着眼，勿該給予我這劇中人以分毫的同情。</p>
<h3>從趙君玉能返滬　說到取名小牛之原因</h3>
<p>— 劉正鵠</p>
<p>趙如泉登台矣，惟與趙曾共患難形影不離之趙君玉，未見　來，一般戲迷，疑寶叢生，茲將君玉未能返滬及幼年取名小牛之原因，濡筆摭記於决。</p>
<p>按君玉爲南中四大名旦之一，婓聲梨園，初習大面藝名大大使奎官，繼改武生，後唱小生，近年則以靑衣花衫鳴於時。總其一生藝事，腹筍淵博，令人折服，如泉倚之如左右臂者，良有以也。余最愛聆其演小生戲白門樓一劇，扮相英俊爽颯，如玉樹臨風，唱亦頗饒朱味（紫雲）；君玉本爲武生底子，造詣深湛，惜以年來沉湎黑籍，生平尤喜漁色，二十年前淫姬蕩娃，咸爭暱之，現色藝較之當年，自遜色不少，幾不爲人掛齒。君玉在滇，有土產可吸，價値頗廉，生活乃安，故其雖欲來滬，未果也。</p>
<p>君玉在建甌祖　綬，慈祥見稱於鄉里；父小廉，爲名武生，余髫齡時，嘗觀彼演鐵公雞，至今猶印象甚深，君玉固亦伶王世家也。其乳名小牛者，傳爲其祖父篙綬一旦總涼戶外，忽見一農牽牛而過，至前牛忽趦不行，伏地哀鳴，淚如潮湧，嵩綬憐而異之，詢農民以故，云將牽宰塲待沽，問其値，曰三十金足矣。嵩綬遂以三十二番，赦牛死，釋之放牲園。時其媳，已懷孕足甩，臨盆待產，某日嵩綬在家午覺，朦朧間見一老牛奔入內寢，駭極而醒，忽家人通報添孫矣。嵩綬回憶夢中事，乃取名小半事雖涉於迷信，固頗有趣也。君玉受家之餘慶，天才橫溢，不難逞雄菊部，惜乎誤人歧途，不獲與如泉同時競爽歇浦，偃蹇天南，無怪小廉聞其未來，輒欲老淚縱橫也。</p>
<p>「一夜皇后」槪述　奇「一夜皇后」所叙述的是一個纏綿悱惻深爲動人的故事，這故事在導演者的愼重處理之下，顯得相當的精湛。張善琨氏初次　演，有如此的成績，不能不說是一鳴驚人之作！</p>
<p>故事根據自著名京劇梅龍鎭，但梅龍鎭所演的不過是琪屑的一段，而二夜事后」則吾，木片不但一反京劇梅龍鎭的面自，且更滲以時代的意識，如李鳳姐被惡覇李景武所搶，小喜喚起羣衆協力同心前往援救；李鳳姐與正德帝分離時，勸正德帝應以國事爲重，勿戀戀兒女私情等等；都可見該片確是卓越不凡，而値得再三回味的！</p>
<p>陳雲裳的「木蘭從軍」與「雲裳仙子」接連都紛了我們非常好的印象，這部戲裏，由於導演者給以更多的特寫鏡頭的機會，表演更進一步。梅熹的正德帝，也決不是一個等閒的演員所能勝任。其他幾位的適合個性，都可見本片在攝製前的確經過一番審愼考慮而配合的。</p>
<h3>秋涼後書塲的新氣象</h3>
<p>— 聿修</p>
<p>熱天本來是書塲的「坐月」，你想在大伏炎天，有誰高興悶坐在斗室裹面，所以嚮檔先生，例有「歇夏之舉，以免「頂了石臼做戲」，吃力而並不討好，書塲上儘讓着二三路脚色，去濫竽充數。現在金風送凉，早又新秋天氣，各書塲自然不便等閒放過，都紛紛重新調整人馬，振作精神，於是又有一番新氣象，足資報吿。</p>
<p>第一個好消息是息影多時的李伯康，現在東山再起，特爲某公司播昔，珠潤玉圓，愈多精彩。其决是一度喧傳失踪的黃異庵，又重新在湖園發現。李黃同爲潤餘社中堅，而且西廂楊乃武二書，又都成了只此一家，別無分出的「海內孤本」所以無論電台播送，書塲彈唱，都能到處受人歡迎，自不待言。</p>
<p>雅廬羅致一「沈薛」「蔣朱」「唐馮」和新從蘇州出來的老牌隋唐吳鈞安，陣容一新，可稱首屈一指；只有南園的葉聲翔許繼祥嚴雪亭周玉泉四嚮檔，堪相頡頑。匯泉大中，因有雅廬南園在前「攀」先生不能不格外愼重一點，大的中秋過後，始有分曉。</p>
<p>光裕社的評話名家，現在差不多全集中在上海：像葉聲翔的金台，許繼祥的英烈，吳均安的隋唐，李漢臣的岳傳，各有特長，足資號召，現在正做「敵檔」老聽客左右逢源，可爲「聽福」不淺。</p>
<p>嚼餘社集中精銳於南京一個塲子，擁有「梅蘭」「琴芸」「三天諸嚮檔勢力雄厚，足與光裕社潤餘二社，任何塲子，蛟一日短長。而且各出時新開篇，逐日大量「孝敬」，所以喜歡聽「唱」的聽客們，無不趨之若騖，近日門庭若市，每塲軋足，營業着實不壞。</p>

<h3>German Foreign Minister Re-visits Moscow: Consultations on Military and Diplomatic Issues; Soviet Influence Extends Towards the Baltic Sea, Pressuring Estonia to Conclude a Broad Political Agreement</h3>
<p>Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of the Soviet government, arrived here by plane today. He will hold consultations with the Soviet government on various issues related to the Polish situation. (TASS dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of the Soviet government, departed from Tempelhof Airport at 9:00 this morning on the "Grenzmark" aircraft for Moscow. He was accompanied by the Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, the embassy secretary Pavlov, and several of Ribbentrop's staff. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by the Soviet Ambassador to Germany and 36 others, departed from Berlin by plane at 9:00 this morning for Moscow. It is reported that leader Butz also among them. They arrived in Königsberg at 11:15 a.m., stopping briefly before continuing to Moscow. They are expected to arrive at Moscow's civilian airport at 6:00 p.m. today. It is unlikely that any talks will begin before tomorrow, as the Turkish delegation is also in Moscow. The Turkish delegation will leave Moscow tomorrow. Diplomatic circles in the Soviet capital believe that Ribbentrop's visit to the Soviet Union is not only about the Polish situation but must also involve other important issues, such as a Soviet-German military alliance or jointly preventing Turkey from joining the Anglo-French bloc. London newspapers are refraining from making hasty speculations about the significance of the German Foreign Minister's visit to Moscow. Some observers fear that another diplomatic bombshell is brewing, while others believe that Stalin's suspicion of Hitler is no less than that of Britain and France, and find solace in this. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Since the announcement of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow, Berlin residents have been paying close attention. Because the German-Soviet treaty stipulates the obligation for both countries to discuss issues of common interest, the general public is not surprised by the German Foreign Minister's visit. Furthermore, after the collapse of Poland, it is necessary to consider the future fate of its territory. According to political figures, the dividing line between Germany and the Soviet Union only demarcates the areas that the German and Soviet armies should immediately occupy and should not be regarded as the final border. Many believe that Ribbentrop will use the opportunity of his visit to Moscow to discuss other diplomatic issues with the Soviet government, including the aggressive war of Britain and France on the Western Front, and the issues raised by the visits of the foreign ministers of Estonia and Turkey to Moscow. Due to the special nature of this visit, no procedures can be stipulated. No information has been obtained regarding the duration of Ribbentrop's stay in the Soviet Union. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is scheduled to arrive here before tomorrow. Foreign observers have generally stated that this is the second time Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has been invited since August 23rd, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and even Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin have not reciprocated. Furthermore, after Estonian Foreign Minister Selter visited here once before, he suddenly returned to his country to attend an emergency cabinet meeting. It is now reported that he has come to Moscow for the second time. It is generally believed that Germany is very concerned about the Soviet Union's intentions towards Estonia. Therefore, Ribbentrop's second invitation is probably related to the Estonian issue. In addition, the Soviet troops in Poland are now gradually approaching the border line set by Germany and the Soviet Union, and they should construct defensive public works along this line to strengthen the Soviet Union's position vis-à-vis Germany. According to diplomatic sources here, under these circumstances, it is in Germany's interest to resolve the Polish issue as soon as possible; otherwise, the Soviet Union may continue to make demands on Germany based on its newly created advantage. For this reason, foreign observers believe that before German leader Hitler proposes a peace agreement to Britain and France, he may wish to first establish an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union so that Germany can have no worries about the future if Britain and France refuse the peace agreement. Furthermore, with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu here negotiating with Molotov, Ribbentrop's sudden visit to the Soviet Union may be intended to influence these negotiations and encourage the Soviet Union to pressure Turkey to distance itself from the Western European democracies. This is also possible. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Estonian Foreign Minister Selter arrived here again at 5:30 p.m. today by plane from the capital of his country. In addition to the country's envoy August, two jurists accompanied him, one being the speaker of the country's parliament and the dean of the Law Faculty, Uluots, and the other being Professor Piip, an expert in international law. It is said that after arriving here, they will sign an agreement with the Soviet authorities to dispel Soviet concerns about Estonia's neutrality. As for the extent to which the country's independent status can be maintained, nothing has been heard. What is known is that the issue of "foreign submarines appearing in the Baltic Sea" is no longer being discussed. According to some sources, the German naval attaché to the Soviet embassy went to the capital of Estonia yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Denmark: According to the "Political News," the Estonian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Selter, is scheduled to fly to Moscow today. The Soviet Union has requested Estonia to sign a new trade agreement and use a port in the Baltic Sea, probably Vosel or Baltiyskiy, as a naval base. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital: Regarding Estonian Foreign Minister Selter's sudden departure from the city and the country's Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Moscow, it has been learned here that the Soviet Russian government wants to conclude a broad political and economic agreement with Estonia, one of the clauses of which is that Soviet Russia demands the establishment of a free port area in Estonian ports, where Soviet Russia can station troops to protect Soviet Russian interests. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow: After Estonian Foreign Minister Selter came here the other day and had a meeting with Foreign Minister Molotov, he suddenly returned home. Then, the country's envoy to Soviet Russia, Leo August, returned to his country this morning. It is said that this trip is intended to accelerate the current negotiations between the two sides. Foreign observers say that Foreign Minister Selter's visit is just like the visit of Czech President Hácha to Berchtesgaden, Germany, in March of this year to accept German demands. It is rumored that Molotov made several demands on Selter, the nature of which is like an ultimatum. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to reliable sources received here, the reason for Estonian Foreign Minister's sudden visit to Moscow is that the Soviet Union demanded that Estonia immediately disarm the armaments and batteries on three islands in Finland. It is said that these three islands are geographically sufficient to control the throat of Leningrad, so their armament is deeply resented by the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Finnish Capital: Although official sources here believe that the news that the Soviet Union is about to protest against the armament plan of the Åland Islands is a rumor and is not credible, neutral sources say that the Soviet Union's influence in the Baltic Sea has recently increased significantly. At the same time, the Åland Islands hold a pivotal position in the Baltic Sea war, so the Soviet Union's demand for a solution to this issue may not be far away. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London: According to news here today, the Soviet government has obtained the consent of the German government to include the Eastern Balkan countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, causing concern among all circles about the fate of Estonia, Romania, and Bulgaria. According to news from Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, Foreign Minister Selter will travel to Moscow again on Wednesday to discuss the "tense relations" between the Soviet Union and Estonia with the Soviet side. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Stays in the Soviet Capital: Talks Between the Two Sides Are Very Harmonious</p>
<p>Moscow: Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Molotov received Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu at the Kremlin yesterday. The guests included the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yakgun, Soviet Deputy People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs Potemkin and Dekanozov, and the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Terentiev. Afterwards, Saracoğlu, accompanied by the Turkish Ambassador, met with the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Kalinin. The Secretary of the Presidium, Gorkin, and the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Terentiev, were also present. On the same day, Molotov invited Saracoğlu and his entourage and members of the Turkish Embassy to lunch. Among the Soviet dignitaries present were Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Potemkin, Dekanozov, Lozovsky, Gorkin, and Terentiev. During the luncheon, Molotov and Saracoğlu exchanged toasts. (TASS dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Turkish Embassy in the Soviet Union hosted a banquet this afternoon to welcome Foreign Minister Saracoğlu. Also present were Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Defense Commissar Voroshilov, and many senior officials of the Foreign Commissariat. It is reported that after Saracoğlu's arrival here, he had three meetings with Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday afternoon and evening. The progress was reportedly very good. Foreign Minister Saracoğlu was originally scheduled to return home tomorrow evening, but because German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, at the invitation of the Soviet government, is scheduled to arrive here today to resolve "various issues arising from the Polish situation," Soviet and Turkish ministers will not have time to hold talks tomorrow, and Saracoğlu's return date has had to be postponed. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>No Rift in Soviet-Romanian Relations: Maintaining Neutrality as the Basis</p>
<p>Rome: Rumors that relations between the Soviet Union and Romania are strained, and that Soviet troops arriving near the Romanian border have had many disputes with Romanian border guards, have been denied by officials here, who describe them as pure fabrications. They say that border traffic between the Soviet Union and Romania is normal, and that relations between the two countries are based on a policy of neutrality, with no rift between them. Soviet military authorities on the southern border of Poland are particularly capable of maintaining a completely neutral attitude towards Romania. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: It is reported that the Soviet Union has reaffirmed its guarantee to respect Romanian neutrality. Official and unofficial circles have expressed surprise at the rumors that the Soviet Union will make changes in Bessarabia (formerly part of Russia and ceded to Romania after the European War). The Soviet Union has recently been building fortifications along the Dniester River border and increasing its troops there, and Romania has also increased its troops to defend Bessarabia and is also building defenses on the Romanian side of the Dniester River. However, officials have expressed the hope that the Soviet Union will not have any malicious intentions. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Deployed on the Border; Tensions in Soviet-Estonian Relations; The Soviet Union Attaches Importance to the Escape of the Polish Submarine; Still Not Satisfied with Estonia's Explanation</h3>
<p>Moscow: The local radio station broadcast a message last night, stating that Soviet troops have been concentrated on the Estonian border, so the Northern Russian Red Army has been adapted to wartime organization. Also, according to the official radio station, the Soviet fleet is cruising between Russia and Finland, and the fleet in the White Sea has also "gained new functions due to the environment." (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the escape of a Polish submarine from the port of Tallinn, Estonia, the Soviet government is not satisfied with the explanation made by the Estonian government and insists that this submarine has entered the Gulf of Finland after being repaired in the Estonian port. Therefore, the situation between the Soviet Union and Estonia has become serious. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter's visit here is precisely for this reason. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: TASS released a communiqué today regarding the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Estonia as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the escape of a Polish submarine detained in the port of Tallinn, the explanation given by the Estonian government is not satisfactory. Therefore, the Soviet Union and Estonia are engaged in negotiations to determine steps to ensure the security of Soviet territorial waters and prevent the activities of foreign submarines hiding in the Baltic Sea. According to the Estonian government, when the aforementioned Polish submarine entered Estonian territorial waters, 'its machinery was damaged and its movements were not flexible.' If this is the case, it is difficult to understand how a submarine so damaged could have escaped the eyes and ears of the guards and escaped from the capital's port. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the submarine was completely repaired and refueled in the port of Tallinn so that it could escape on its own.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, according to news from Leningrad, periscopes of submarines of unknown nationality were found in two places in Luga Bay today. From this, it can be concluded that there must be a secret base for submarines of unknown nationality somewhere near the Estonian coast. Taken together, the problem of ensuring the security of Soviet territorial waters and preventing the activities of submarines is very important." (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a broadcast report from Moscow received here, regarding the Estonian ship "Osel," the Soviet Union has issued an ultimatum to Estonia. However, the German Foreign Ministry and the Propaganda Department have denied knowledge of this news. It is reported that the Polish submarine "Osel" entered the port of Tallinn, Estonia, for repairs. According to Swedish sources, it escaped a week ago under the escort of two Estonian soldiers and sailed to the Swedish coast, where the two Estonian soldiers were released in a small boat. However, according to the Estonian side, the Estonian soldiers fired at the submarine when it escaped, but it soon submerged into the water. Although airplanes, warships, and speedboats were dispatched to pursue and attack it, all were unsuccessful. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Port of Tallinn, Estonia: The Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army stated in a radio broadcast yesterday that if Estonia is attacked by another country, it will resolutely stand up and fight to maintain Estonia's independence. Estonia does not want to be involved in this European war, but if another country attacks Estonia, Estonia will have to fight it, just as it did twenty years ago. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Capital of Latvia: Due to the suspension of Soviet-Estonian business negotiations, the Estonian government held a meeting yesterday afternoon in the capital of Estonia, chaired by President Pads. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter also presented a report to the joint meeting of the two houses of parliament, but the content has not yet been announced. According to official statements, Foreign Minister Selter, along with Estonian Envoy to the Soviet Union Rae and Professors Uluots and Piip of the International Political Committee, are scheduled to travel to Moscow today to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. Rumors that the negotiations were suspended due to the issue of Soviet transit trade through the capital of Estonia seem to have been confirmed. The official hope is to formally announce the truth today. (Haitong dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares to Launch a Peace Offensive Against Britain and France; If Rejected Again, It Will Not Hesitate to Fight, Claiming to Have Weapons to Win</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland: The Berlin correspondent of the "National Daily" cabled that "German officials say that Germany will launch a 'peace offensive' within three days. The current question is whether Germany can make peace with Britain and France or whether it must implement a main force war on the Western Front. Although Germany does not want a long-term war, if Britain and France are determined not to make peace, it will have to deal with it with all its strength. The German side urgently wants to obtain an answer to this question," etc.</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The Rotterdam Daily recently published news from Berlin stating that semi-official German sources and the press are saying that if the peace proposals that Germany can put forward are rejected, it will fight Britain with all its strength, without any scruples. The country's newspapers also stated, "Germany has a weapon that has not yet been used. Once it is forced to do so, it will use it. Its destructive power is very great and sufficient to achieve a decisive effect." This so-called weapon may refer to a newly invented poison gas bomb, but it is not yet known. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Brussels: German newspapers have recently published news, often saying that Belgium will launch a diplomatic initiative in the hope of restoring peace in Europe. Political figures here have commented on this, saying that according to Dutch newspapers, German leader Hitler may often propose peace agreements to Western European democracies in a short period of time, based on the current situation, but there is absolutely no hope of accepting these agreements. Therefore, what the German newspapers say about how Belgium will do this and that is probably just a probing nature. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister's Visit to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>British Newspapers Speculate</p>
<p>London: Regarding German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's second visit to Moscow, British newspapers are very surprised. What is the truth behind it? Too many newspapers put forward two explanations. One says that Germany is very uneasy about the Soviet Union's gradual expansion of its influence into the Balkan Peninsula and therefore urgently wants to reach a compromise with the Soviet government. Another says that this is a strategy of Germany before proposing peace agreements to Britain and France. Judging from the fact that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and Ribbentrop arrived in the Soviet Union at the same time, the first statement is not without reason. However, judging from the concentration of German troops on the Western Front, it seems to coincide with the second statement. Which one is true and which one is false is still difficult to say at this moment. The "Daily Mail" wrote, "Certain circles believe that the real goal of Ribbentrop's trip is to discuss with the Soviet authorities a peace plan that can make Britain and France feel satisfied and at the same time preserve Hitler's face. The fate of the Balkan Peninsula countries may also be involved." The "Times" published a report from a correspondent on the Lithuanian border regarding Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow, saying that "Since the implementation of the 'New Axis' policy (referring to the Berlin-Moscow Axis), the German government has been quite disappointed, so it has to postpone various issues in Eastern Europe." The "Daily Express" wrote, "Leader Hitler will launch a peace offensive against us in the near future. He and the important cabinet members have recently been scattered in various places and returned to Berlin yesterday. Today, they gathered at the State Council to hold an important meeting. According to the German government's intentions, it wants to threaten Britain and France to accept the country's proposals, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is rushing to Moscow at the same time as Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu is visiting the Soviet Union, which is also deliberately mystifying, intending to make people believe that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Turkey are plotting to conclude a secret agreement and divide the Balkan Peninsula and the Near East. At the same time, Germany and the Soviet Union intend to divide the Baltic Sea coastal countries. In fact, this peace offensive and the concentration of troops on the Western Front are enough to prove that Germany has reached the end of its rope. "If Germany wants to continue the war, it can only invade Romania and advance towards the Black Sea. "But if Germany takes an offensive on the Western Front now, then its real meaning is that the German military authorities know that the road to the East has been blocked by the Soviet Union, so it has to turn to the West." The "News Chronicle" wrote, "The Soviet Union's attempt to economically control the Balkan Peninsula is becoming increasingly active. This is what Leader Hitler is uneasy about, so he decided to send Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Moscow to try to stop it. Some say that the German side has always believed that after the partitioning of Poland, Stalin intends to put forward peace proposals. This time, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop may be persuading Stalin that the time for putting forward peace proposals has come. However, no matter what, the talks between the Soviet Union and Germany today will have an important impact on the war on the Western Front. It can be asserted that rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union may conclude a military treaty are difficult to realize. The Soviet Union is now pursuing a self-serving policy. It does not feel threatened in any way. Germany is at war with Britain and France, so it has no time to spare. It is not beneficial for the Soviet Union to form a military treaty with it." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Relations Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>German-Soviet Suspicion Unresolved: Britain and France Take Advantage</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland: The local "New Free Press" recently commented on the relations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that "Britain and France have remained calm about the Soviet Union's entry into Poland and have decided not to sever diplomatic relations with the country. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union's move is enough to force Germany to maintain a significant number of troops in Poland, which is indirectly beneficial to Britain and France. As for the Soviet Union's failure to make demands on Romania's Bessarabia province (formerly part of Russia before the last European War), this may be in return for Britain and France. Britain and France have an obligation to guarantee Romania, the same as their obligation to Poland. If the Soviet Union were to take any action against Romania, Britain and France would have to deal with it. As for the situation in the Baltic Sea, if the Soviet Union takes no action in the Gulf of Finland after Germany occupied the Free City of Danzig and Poland's Port of Gdynia, then Germany will have an advantage in the Baltic Sea and extend its influence to the country, which is not what the Soviet Union wants to hear. However, unless Germany is completely defeated on the Western Front, the Soviet Union will remain dormant and maintain a good-faith neutrality towards Germany to avoid getting caught in the whirlpool and causing a crisis within the country. In short, the Soviet Union does not intend to help Germany, and it does not want to abandon the promotion of communism within the country, waiting for the country to collapse before taking action. Britain and France are not pessimistic about the close relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, but only contain the Bolsheviks within their own countries, which is the reason for this." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London: Military experts believe that Germany's losses in Poland should not be ignored. According to French observations, the new recruits Germany transferred to the Western Front came from the interior of Germany and certainly not from Poland. Some say that there are 500,000 Soviet troops on the Polish border. If they only want to occupy Russia and Polish Ukraine, then 500,000 troops would be enough, so why suddenly mobilize four million people? The National Socialist Party is deeply concerned about the revival of Pan-Slavism in the Balkans under the guidance of the Communist Party. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The European War and the Destruction of the World Economy</h3>
<p>Since Germany declared the end of the Eastern Front war, the European war has entered a new stage. Germany originally hoped that after defeating Poland, Britain and France would lose their objective of fighting Germany. Then, a third party would mediate to achieve a victorious peace. Unexpectedly, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's definition of "localized war and the major war has not yet broken out" was not accepted by Britain and France. Therefore, the war on the Western Front gradually intensified. Judging from the current war situation, France has the Maginot Line, and Germany has the Siegfried Line. Both are strong and defensible. Unless one side is willing to violate the neutrality of other countries, it will not easily gain a deep penetration opportunity. Therefore, a stalemate is inevitable, and a long-term war situation will emerge.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is a comprehensive battle of military, political, and economic forces. Comparing these three forces, in a quick decisive strategy, military and political factors are the most important. However, in a long-term war, the economy is the determining factor. For example, Germany's defeat in the First World War was due to excessive economic poverty. We do not need to speculate on whether the current European war requires a long-term war or whether we can achieve a quick and decisive result from the military and political aspects. However, in terms of economics, countries have indeed begun to engage in long-term warfare. Britain has imposed a naval blockade on Germany and is implementing the interception of wartime prohibited goods. Germany has also implemented a counter-blockade policy using submarines. This method of confrontation started extremely fiercely, comparable to the end of the First World War. Although all parties are currently making boastful statements like "You can't starve me to death," the initial results have actually had a considerable effect. Germany has accused Britain's blockade policy of being an inhumane operation against women and children. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also called on the nation to wage a long-term economic war to resist German submarines. These are all expressions of deeply felt wartime oppression.</p>
<p>How the actual economic activities within Britain, France, and Germany are currently, cannot be known to outsiders because they involve military secrets. However, judging from their foreign trade status, the three countries are all highly developed industrial and commercial nations. Therefore, in foreign trade, imports are mostly food and raw materials, while exports are mostly manufactured goods. This is especially true for Britain and Germany. In the past, the import of raw materials and food by Britain often accounted for about 80% of total imports, and the export of manufactured goods also accounted for about 75% of total exports. The import of raw materials and the export of manufactured goods both account for more than 80% of the total import or export value. Britain and Germany both attach great importance to their overseas commerce. Therefore, destroying the other's overseas commerce is the most important economic strategy. Because of this, the struggle between blockade and counter-blockade will inevitably intensify. The impact will not only be on the participating countries themselves, but even all of humanity will suffer significant consequences.</p>
<p>So far, only Britain, France, Poland, and Germany have participated in the European war. The Soviet Union stopped abruptly after entering Poland and cannot be considered a belligerent. The existing antagonistic attitudes are only between Britain and France and Germany. It is currently difficult to predict whether other countries will join the war in the future. However, based on past facts, economic reasons are often the reason for participation in the war. If the scope of economic warfare between the two sides gradually expands, it will be difficult to avoid other countries joining the war, either voluntarily or passively. Britain, France, Germany, and other countries have recently repeatedly declared and guaranteed the neutrality of neighboring countries, and declared that they will comply with the international laws of war. However, modern guarantees have fundamentally become a way of lying. International law is only an expression of humanitarian justice recognized by the international community, and it does not actually have coercive sanctions. How can this stop the barbaric actions of war? For example, the scope of activity of Germany's submarine policy is not only around Britain, France, and their territories, but even extends to the coasts of Central and South America. Its destruction of maritime transportation is not limited to sinking British and French merchant ships. Even ships from other neutral countries have been repeatedly bombed by them. For example, Britain's interception of wartime prohibited goods requires neutral countries' merchant ships to be inspected by British warships. In addition, there are indirect restrictions on entrepot trade through neutral countries. For example, yesterday Germany issued a warning to all neutral countries, demanding that they suspend commercial relations with Britain and France. The continuous performance of these kinds of struggles will inevitably expand the scope of the European war. This is imaginable.</p>
<p>Regarding the impact of the European economic war on the world economy: Britain, France, and Germany are all countries that occupy a very important position in world trade. In terms of the value of the three countries' own trade in the past, they account for about 30% of world trade. With the difficulty of maritime transportation and the absolute maintenance of neutrality by non-participating countries, it will not only be Britain, France, and Germany that will be hit, but the trade of the whole of Europe and even the world. In the past, the trade volume of Europe accounted for more than 50% of the total world trade. If more than 50% of the world's trade stops operating, this will cause the world to lose the normal relationship between production and consumption. The war will destroy European economic activity, and will naturally also destroy the economic vitality of places outside Europe. Furthermore, its impact will not only be on the present but will extend far into the future. War is already bloodshed and massacre; economic panic will become chronic carnage.</p>
<h3>Warsaw Besieged for Three Weeks, Reduced to Level Ground by Artillery and Airplanes; Defending Soldiers Fought Bravely, Repeatedly Thwarting Powerful Enemies; Berlin War Report Says Defending Soldiers Have Requested Surrender</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday was the 21st day of the siege of Warsaw. In the evening, the city broadcast a radio message, stating that 200 airplanes were constantly bombing, heavy artillery was also bombarding fiercely, German airplanes dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs, causing many fires, most public buildings were burning, firefighters and civilians were bravely putting out the fires, but due to lack of water, the effect was minimal. The food situation is already difficult, especially because of continuous shelling and air raids by the Germans, making it even more inconvenient to distribute food. Hundreds of horses killed by artillery shells in the streets have been slaughtered and divided for food. Furthermore, according to a public statement issued by the Warsaw Garrison Headquarters on the 25th of this month, German airplanes dropped incendiary bombs, causing hundreds of fires, and eight German airplanes have been shot down. Loss of life is incalculable. Warsaw has become a scene of rubble, but the defending soldiers are currently maintaining defenses and repelling the enemy. Modlin is currently surrounded but is still bravely holding out. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, the German High Command announced that since the German army began its fierce attack on Warsaw yesterday, the Polish army's first and second lines of defense have been captured by the German army. Polish generals all knew that the situation was hopeless. This morning, they expressed their willingness to surrender the Warsaw fortress to the German army. The German Commander-in-Chief ordered General Blaskowitz to negotiate the surrender of Warsaw. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A report received here states that Warsaw surrendered unconditionally at 10:30 this morning. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Troops on Western Front Bombard French Rear; German Reinforcements Arrive in the Rhineland</h3>
<p>(Paris) The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 46, stating that "Last night, enemy artillery, in addition to shelling the city of Wissembourg behind our army, remained generally quiet." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 45, stating that "Yesterday, enemy artillery was active in many locations south of the cities of Deux-Ponts and Bitche in the Saar region. Enemy infantry also attempted to attack the banks of the Lauter River at dawn but were repelled by our army." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The war on the Western Front continues in the countryside west of Haguenau, connecting the Saar Line and the Haguenau Forest. The nature of the war has not changed, limited to artillery bombardment and local skirmishes. In each engagement, no more than a company of soldiers from either side participates. German artillery fire bombarding the French front has now weakened. Except for the area east of Deux-Ponts, where there is still significant activity, the front is relatively quiet. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(Copenhagen) A telegram from a political reporter stationed on the German front line states that the German army units that were originally fighting in Poland have now been mostly transferred to the Western Front. Residents of towns near the Siegfried Line, including residents of Aachen, have been almost completely evacuated. The German army is currently constructing fortifications in the Wissembourg area. The army has sufficient supplies, but food for the people is severely restricted. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French General Headquarters is currently studying in detail the German concentration of forces in Aachen and Baden. As a result of French air force reconnaissance deep into German territory, it has been discovered that German reinforcements are now distributed along the Rhine River. These reinforcements, coming from the Eastern Front, are very few in number. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(Brussels) Socialist Member of Parliament Henri Rolin recently published an article in the newspaper Le Peuple, stating, "Germany is actively constructing defensive fortifications near the city of Aachen. Looking eastward from the Hoeselt customs office on the Belgian border, it is clearly visible. The German side has already built a huge bunker and constructed a tank defense line made of reinforced concrete, painted green." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Republic Established in Poland</h3>
<p>(Moscow) It is reported that the Soviet government will immediately establish a Polish Soviet Republic in the Soviet-occupied areas of Poland, in accordance with the principles outlined in Stalin's book "Marxism and the National Question," and that Communist Party members from Moscow and Kyiv will replace the Polish authorities in governing, in order to completely eliminate the Polish nation's resistance and traditional spirit. According to Stalin's views, the national question within Poland can only be resolved through revolutionary means, and all national questions are crucial issues in relation to the labor revolution and the labor dictatorship. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Chamberlain's Speech in the House of Commons: Reporting on the Current War Situation</h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain today spoke in the House of Commons, dispelling any hopes abroad that peace might be possible after the conquest of Poland. The Prime Minister stated, "The unity and determination of our people has never been greater than it is today. We are determined to eliminate the constant threat of German aggression once and for all, of which Poland is only the most recent example. This simple fact cannot be stated too often. Our country and France have joined the war specifically to eliminate this threat to ourselves and the world. Our people are now more united than ever before, determined to achieve this goal."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of the war on the Western Front, saying that French forces have continued to make advances in some areas of the Western Front. Although German reactions have increased, French forces have managed to maintain all their gains.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, in recalling what he said on September 20 regarding the difficult problems faced by the Romanian government due to the retreat of Polish forces into Romanian territory, stated that the British government, upon hearing the news of the assassination of Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu, has followed the Romanian government's efforts to deal with these difficult problems with sympathy. On September 21, he instructed the British Ambassador to Romania to express to the Romanian government the shock of the British government and people at this atrocity, and their sincere condolences for the loss suffered by Romania.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of the war against submarines, saying that there have been many recent attacks on German submarines. Since the last war, great progress in the endurance, speed, and reliability of aircraft has enabled the British Air Force to make a very important contribution to the work of searching for and attacking submarines. Coastal patrol work has also greatly helped the navy in defending against the scourge of submarines.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of the war preparations of the Dominions, saying that these preparations are still actively underway. Dominion warships are currently cooperating with the British fleet, and Dominion armies are also currently in training in order to join the war when the environment requires it. Dominion air forces are currently preparing to serve overseas. As a result of close cooperation, the supply of munitions, food, and raw materials is now flowing from the Dominions to Britain in increasing quantities.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of civil defense, saying that Britain is at risk of air raids, and that preparations for civil air defense must not be relaxed in the slightest, nor must the scope of civil defense be reduced in the slightest, so as not to weaken Britain's ability to cope with air raids.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke at length about the work of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, saying that, generally speaking, the functions performed by the Ministry of Blockade during the last war will now be exercised by the Ministry of Economic Warfare. The main purpose of this ministry is to disrupt Germany's economic structure to the extent that it cannot continue the war. If Britain can prevent Germany from importing the raw materials necessary for its war industry, it will certainly be able to destroy Germany's ability to wage a long-term war. However, the people of the country should not be overly optimistic, because Germany has accumulated varying amounts of the various raw materials it needs, so the people of the country cannot expect results in the short term. Britain's control at sea can cut off Germany's supply of many raw materials from the start of the war. In the three weeks since the start of the war, Britain has seized 256,000 tons of contraband destined for Germany, including 62,000 tons of oil and 37,000 tons of manganese ore.</p>
<p>German propaganda has been very active, claiming that Britain's contraband interception measures have no impact on Germany and only hinder the trade of neutral countries. This propaganda is extremely false. In fact, at the beginning of the war, we clearly announced that we urgently wanted to take care of the needs of the legitimate trade of neutral countries. The British government is willing to consider any suggestions that neutral governments may offer regarding this matter. Currently, the British government is engaged in friendly discussions with several governments. The British government hopes that in some matters, it can establish measures that will simplify contraband management procedures. These facts speak louder than words. I believe that the public opinion of neutral countries will definitely compare Britain's clearly announced policy with Germany's threats to neutral countries that harbor sinister intentions. These German threats have materialized in recent days, such as the sinking of three neutral merchant ships in an environment that clearly violates international law. Germany has recently been promoting the idea of listing food as conditional contraband and criticizing Britain for carrying out an illegal and inhumane blockade. It should be known that naval blockade and land siege are no different. Can the commander besieging the enemy allow food to freely enter the besieged city? In any case, Germany cannot make this kind of accusation when its submarines are attacking ships sailing to Britain, regardless of humanity and the submarine warfare regulations that it previously solemnly acknowledged.</p>
<p>If Britain wants to develop its greatest efforts, the support of both labor and management is essential. The authorities responsible for the machinery industry are now planning to expand the supply of labor. This initiative is particularly inspiring. The trade unions have also agreed to lift their original conditions under appropriate safeguards. This move has spared the government the difficulties of the last war and is a contribution that the entire country appreciates. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Twenty German Airplanes Bomb British Fleet</h3>
<p>(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons this afternoon, "A squadron of our battleships, an aircraft carrier, and several cruisers and destroyers were attacked by approximately 20 German airplanes in the central North Sea yesterday afternoon but suffered no damage or casualties."</p>
<p>According to a message from the German High Command in Berlin today, "Several German bombers suddenly attacked the British fleet in the North Sea yesterday, including several battleships, an aircraft carrier, and several cruisers and destroyers. As a result, one aircraft carrier and one battleship were destroyed." It is reported that the German aircraft returned to their rear bases after completing their mission without any losses.

<h3>Churchill Announces Success in Countering German Submarines; Says German Submarine Commanders Still Considerate of Humanity; Opposition Parties Advocate Swift Prevention of Crisis</h3>
<p>(London) British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill today described the British Navy's extraordinary efforts to counter German submarines in the House of Commons, saying that Britain's response to submarine attacks is, firstly, the implementation of a convoy system, and secondly, the equipment of all merchant ships and fast mail ships with armaments to defend against submarines and aircraft. In the past half month, armed merchant ships have been sailing out of British ports in a steady stream, some under convoy, some departing alone. In a short time, the entire British Empire's shipping industry will be armed. Normally, Britain has 2,000 ships sailing at sea every day, so arming merchant ships is a large-scale undertaking. However, the ports now have gun emplacements and other equipment, as well as trained gunners to manage the gun emplacements and train the crew. Thirdly, British warships are attacking submarines. British warships are now searching for and attacking submarines with great courage and intensity. Compared to 25 years ago, the Central Kingdom today has far more advantages in dealing with submarines. In the past, when searching for and attacking submarines, it often required 15 or 20 destroyers to coordinate actions for a whole day. Now, one or two destroyers are enough to maintain a pursuit for a long time. The intensity of attacks on submarines by warships and aircraft in this war is almost five or six times greater than in any similar period during the last war. In the first half month of the war, Germany has lost six or seven submarines. The Prime Minister has already mentioned this matter before. According to this number, it accounts for ten percent of the total number of submarines that Germany possessed at the start of the war. Counting the submarines that Germany has actively utilized, the number that have been lost is almost one-fourth or one-third. However, Britain's attacks on submarines are only just beginning. The strength of Britain's search and attack on submarines is increasing day by day. Around late October, this strength may be three times greater than at the start of the war, and the opportunities for submarines to attack in the open sea will also be greatly reduced with the implementation of the convoy system. The British Air Force has important work in searching for and attacking submarines in this intense war, supplementing the inadequacy of Britain's strength at the beginning of the war. The Admiralty has decided to make as much use as possible of aircraft carriers in order to protect the many unarmed and unconvooyed merchant ships sailing to the British coast. However, the crisis of naval warfare is always present, and sometimes tragedy cannot be avoided. The Courageous was followed by four destroyers, but two of them happened to be searching for and attacking a certain submarine attacking merchant ships, and were not beside the Courageous. As the Courageous was preparing its aircraft for landing on the deck in the twilight, it was suddenly attacked by an unseen submarine. This is indeed a very rare encounter. However, this blow has not reduced our confidence in the methods currently being adopted. Now, three weeks into naval warfare, I feel that the new methods formulated by the Admiralty before the war do not need to be modified in any way. Britain's world trade is still continuing without interruption and has not been reduced in the slightest. The ships transporting British troops are currently arriving at their destinations under escort, while enemy shipping and commerce have disappeared from the sea. More than two million tons of German ships are now avoiding German and neutral ports. The number of German ships that Britain has already seized and repurposed for its own use is 67,000 tons more than the number that Britain has already lost. (The audience cheered loudly at this.) In terms of oil, Britain has unfortunately lost several oil tankers, but in the first half month, Britain lost 60,000 tons of oil and captured 50,000 tons of enemy oil. In addition, a large number of oil tankers have arrived safely in Britain by normal means. Britain lost 65,000 tons of ships in the first week of the war, 46,000 tons in the second week, and 21,000 tons in the third week. In the last six days, only 9,000 tons have been lost. Britain now has more supplies in storage than it did before the declaration of war. In any case, it is not possible for Germany to starve the British in a short time. German submarine commanders sometimes strive to act humanely. We have seen them give advance warnings and try to help the crew save their lives. One commander even sent a telegram to me personally, telling me the location of the British ship he had sunk, and signed the telegram "German Submarine." When I received the telegram, I did not know where to reply, but that person is now in our hands and is being treated appropriately. (The audience cheered.) However, German submarines are not lacking in cruel acts, as evidenced by the sinking of the Athenia, the Royal Sceptre, and the Haxby. Britain cannot accept that this kind of war does not conflict with the war customs of arbitration and the laws of war that Germany has been willing to accept in recent years. Britain is now trying to make up for the ships it has lost. Therefore, ships that have already been shelved are now being repaired and prepared for sailing, and in addition to implementing shipbuilding procedures, new ships of a simple nature are being rushed to be built. Therefore, Britain will soon have more ships to cope with various new forms of attack. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) After Churchill spoke, Labour Party leader Attlee took the floor and said that the House of Commons welcomes Churchill's powerful remarks and admires the work of the Navy and Air Force in countering the scourge of submarines. The close cooperation between Britain and France in all aspects is also welcomed by the House of Commons. Britain's morale is very good now and should be maintained throughout. Liberal Party leader Sinclair also spoke, slightly criticizing the leaflets that were finally dropped on Germany, saying that he did not believe that these leaflets would have the expected impact on the German people. If British manpower is not utilized properly as soon as possible, extremely bad consequences will occur. Hitler is trying to end the war in six months, so Britain urgently needs active preparation and organization to resist the crisis that Britain will encounter. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Giant Ship Bremen Confirmed to Have Fled to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the German large passenger ship Bremen has been missing since it left New York. According to British naval sources, this ship has already taken refuge in a certain Soviet port. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Sweden Protests to Germany Regarding the Sinking of Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>(Stockholm, Sweden) Following the sinking of two Swedish ships, the "Gatruert Bratt" and the "Szlezien", which were carrying wood pulp and lumber, respectively, by German submarines, the government has ordered its minister to Germany, Mr. Lisher, to lodge a protest with the German government and reserve the right to demand compensation. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Following the repeated sinking of neutral ships, it was rumored that the Swedish government had ordered a ban on the export of celluloid and wood pulp by Swedish ships. The Swedish legation has issued a public statement denying this, stating that the country's export trade is proceeding as usual and there have been no changes. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Stockholm, Sweden) Following a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) in the middle of this month to discuss neutrality issues, it has been decided to hold another meeting here on the 28th of this month to discuss maritime safety issues. It is generally believed that this is related to the repeated sinking of neutral ships. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently claimed that the British government had sent notes to the three neutral countries of Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands, threatening them not to export certain raw materials to Germany, or allow them to be transshipped to Germany, otherwise they would be considered to have violated neutrality. The Information Department has issued a public statement denying this, stating that the governments of Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands have all stated that this is not the case. Furthermore, it is said that Germany claims that it has not signed the 1936 Submarine Warfare Agreement and is not bound by it. In fact, Germany was one of the original signatories to this agreement and was also the first country to violate it. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>The United States Defends Its Neutral Rights, Negotiating with Britain to Reduce Inspection Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Washington) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a speech in the House of Commons today that Britain is negotiating with various neutral countries to resolve the issue of their trade with Germany. When Secretary of State Hull was asked about this matter by reporters today, he replied that the US government hopes to reserve all rights and also hopes to find ways to reduce the difficulties faced by neutral ships due to the belligerents' implementation of blockades. At this moment, they are in contact with the British government to simplify the procedures for British warships to inspect American ships. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently made a statement to reporters, saying that various goods, especially metal products with military value, are necessary for US national defense, and he hopes that the people will not sell them to foreign countries. Also, certain metals such as manganese, tin, and chromium, as well as rubber, the United States has to purchase from foreign countries to supply national defense industries. Although current laws do not prohibit the sale of these items, after I make this request to the press, the people should be able to understand and not export them to foreign countries.

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull reiterated his attitude on neutrality yesterday, stating that the US government is determined to reserve the neutral countries' right to navigate under international law. Therefore, the British and American authorities will hold informal discussions on the scope of naval warfare in order to reduce the difficulties of American shipping. According to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Britain is discussing the issue of naval blockade with neutral countries, so Hull's remarks have indeed confirmed Chamberlain's words. Isolationist senators in the United States held a meeting yesterday and decided to attack President Roosevelt's neutrality plan and oppose the repeal of the arms embargo. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After a senior official announced that the Navy Department had decided to send a large number of warships from the Pacific coast to Hawaiian waters for training, it is widely believed that some officers in the US Navy advocate concentrating the Pacific Fleet in San Pedro Harbor and distributing it to various regions. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) While the Navy Department is preparing to concentrate the fleet for exercises in Hawaii, President Roosevelt yesterday discussed with Representative Scrugham, chairman of the House Naval Appropriations Committee, a plan to strengthen the US Navy. Scrugham informed the President that the Navy seemed ready and that the country was quite confident in the current situation. After meeting with the President, Scrugham told reporters that the European war would probably not increase the US Navy budget for the next year. He solemnly stated that the size of the naval budget will be based on developments between now and January 1, 1940. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference Discusses Neutrality Issues, Plans to Divide a Safe Zone on the Western Side of the Americas</h3>
<p>(Panama City, Panama) Regarding the issue of maintaining neutrality in the Americas, Mexico, Cuba, Bolivia, Colombia, and the United States have all submitted proposals to the Pan-American Conference. The conference held a closed-door meeting at 10:45 am to discuss the proposals of Cuba and Colombia, but no vote was taken. It continued to meet in the afternoon and decided to form three committees: a Neutrality Committee, a Peacekeeping Committee, and an Economic Cooperation Committee. The Cuban proposal has attracted great attention from all parties, but it involves many issues that need to be studied at length. The main purpose of the proposal is to establish a so-called "continental sea" as a safe zone on both sides of the American continent, that is, in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, so that all wars, in whatever form, will not spread to the coasts of the Americas. The establishment of this zone is based on the preservation of neutrality by the American countries, requiring respect from all belligerents. The key points of this proposal can be divided into three items: (1) Any actions by belligerents that are intended to spread the war to the continental sea shall be regarded as endangering the security of the Americas. (2) Presumed lines will be drawn in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans between the western Americas and Europe and Africa, and between the eastern Americas and Asia. Within these lines is the continental sea, which will be a safe zone in which belligerents may not engage in combat or exercise belligerent rights, interfering with the commerce or mutual relations of the American countries. (3) After the above proposal is passed, it will be published in the form of a declaration, named the "Panama Declaration". (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Hu Gives Speech in the US, Saying Countries Will Continue to Aid China</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih recently gave a speech to the American Women's Press Association, stating that although the European war has broken out, all countries will continue to aid China. China has been fighting for all democratic countries for more than two years. Now that countries are fighting for the restoration of Poland, they cannot abandon China. Even the Soviet Union probably has no intention of abandoning aid to China. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) China's army mouthpiece, "Saodang Bao," published an article this morning stating that President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act is beneficial to Britain and France and has no impact on China. Because German merchant ships have disappeared from the sea, the "cash and carry" terms only benefit Britain and France. Since the United States has not recognized the war between China and Japan, the current Neutrality Act will not affect China. The new Neutrality Act is ostensibly aimed at preventing the United States from being drawn into the European war, so President Roosevelt's proposal will likely be passed by Congress. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>US Revises Neutrality Act, Lindbergh Does Not Oppose Lifting Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>(Washington) Colonel Lindbergh, a famous aviator who advocated banning arms exports, held a closed-door meeting yesterday with six senators who advocated repealing the embargo provisions to discuss the revision of the Neutrality Act. It is said that his views on the government authorities show agreement. If so, the isolationist faction has probably lost an important leader. A senator who participated in the meeting said that the rumor that Colonel Lindbergh belongs to the isolationist faction is not accurate, and that the current Neutrality Act really needs to be revised, which Colonel Lindbergh also agrees with. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Ottawa) Regarding the revision of the US Neutrality Act, the draft proposed by the government occasionally stipulates that the various restrictions of the current Neutrality Act do not apply to military supplies transported abroad via rivers, lakes, and the land border with the United States. Although the term "abroad" does not specify a country, its intention is clearly to give the Canadian Federation a convenience that other belligerents cannot enjoy. Political figures here are very pleased to hear this, believing that after this amendment is established, American military supplies can come continuously, directly improving the Canadian Federation's combat capability, which also indirectly improves the combat capability of Britain and France. Therefore, Canada will occupy a very important central position between Britain and France and the United States. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Japan Embarks to Return to Post</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, has returned to the country for four months. Yesterday, he boarded a ship here to go to Yokohama.

Also, US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, is scheduled to sail to Manila on the Cleveland liner today. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Announces Increased Income Tax</h3>
<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Simon declared, "The current development plans must be based on preparation for a three-year war. Therefore, the people of the whole country must make significant sacrifices and contributions to national taxation. Various direct tax rates must be increased, including income tax, which should be increased to seven shillings from January 1st to March 31st next year. The next fiscal year, that is, from April 1st next year, should be increased to seven and a half shillings. It is estimated that this fiscal year can increase revenue by £70 million, and the next year can increase revenue by £146 million." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>French Government Decides to Dissolve Communist Party, Move Carries Great Significance</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet has decided to dissolve the Communist Party, which split from the Socialist Party in 1920. The leaders of the Communist Party are Garsin, Doray, and Kalamanas. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of State decided today to dissolve the Communist Party and all organizations related to the Party, and to prohibit the publication of all kinds of books and pictures promoting communism. Communist congressmen must accept this decision of the government and stop propagating communism in order to continue to attend the congress. However, the congress may still convene closed meetings when necessary and refuse Communist congressmen to attend. (The French General Confederation of Labor decided yesterday to completely break away from the Communist Party.) In addition, the Council of State also decided that insulting the British Empire will be punished in the same way as insulting France. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet decided that no action would be taken against the 70 communist members of the House of Representatives and the two communist members of the Senate unless they broke the law. At the cabinet meeting, Premier Daladier reviewed the overall political and military situation. The French Communist Party has 500,000 dues-paying members. In the 1936 election, the Communist Party received 1.25 million votes. The party organization can be described as second to none among French parties. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Council of State decided to dissolve the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations, the police authorities sent personnel to guard the Party headquarters and the offices of various organizations, and prevented Party members from continuing their activities. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The dissolution of the French Communist Party has been commented on by political and diplomatic figures, who all say that its significance is extremely great. It is not only related to domestic affairs, but also a clear proof of France's determination to resist internal aggression. In the past, German propaganda often falsely accused France of being the source of the "Red Peril". France's actions this time are a response to this. Since the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement, European countries from Italy to the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey have been uneasy about the threat of Bolshevism. Recently, there have been rumors that the Soviet Union concentrated its troops and threatened the border of Romania, although the Romanian side has firmly denied it. However, the nature of the Soviet Union's influence on Poland has already affected the ideological realm. Given the situation, those Eastern European countries with weaker social structures and Slavic minorities in their countries are right to be afraid. It is reported that the governments of Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria are currently exchanging views and plan to organize a united front to strengthen their solidarity. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Hungary is Highly Wary of the Soviet Union, Soviet Troops Are Only Sixteen Kilometers from the Hungarian Border</h3>
<p>(Budapest) According to news heard here today, the progress of the Soviet Red Army has been halted due to wind and snow in the Carpathian Mountains. The Red Army is still sixteen kilometers away from the Hungarian border. Political circles here were initially alarmed by the fact that they will soon be directly adjacent to the Soviet Union, as this development was completely unexpected by the Hungarians. According to officials here, Hungary's participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact is not against the Soviet Union, but only against the Third International. However, people here have always regarded the Third International and the Soviet Union as one and the same, with no difference between them. (Soviet Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>Lithuania Trusts the Soviet Union, Believes the Crisis is Over, Army Begins to Demobilize</h3>
<p>(Lithuanian Capital) Since the Lithuanian government obtained the guarantee from Germany and the Soviet Union that they would respect Lithuania's neutrality, it has continued its demobilization efforts today. According to Lithuanian newspapers, Lithuania and the Soviet Union have always been friendly, and now that Soviet troops have arrived on the borders of Lithuania, what worries do we have?

<h3>The Czech Nation is Under Violent Rule, Puppet Government Obeys Orders, Revolution Will Surely Erupt One Day</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the leader of the Czech Catholic Party, former Czech Prime Minister Šrámek, arrived here, he confirmed the unrest in Bohemia and Moravia. Mr. Šrámek recently secretly left, passing through the Polish border to arrive here, accompanied by Hara, the deputy president of the National Unity Party. According to the Germans, the only party that exists in the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia is the National Unity Party. Šrámek told reporters that when he left, the Prague government was nothing more than a puppet. The German secret police wield absolute power and implement a reign of terror. Even among moderates, their anger is close to boiling point. He believes that the rebellion that occurred in Bohemia and Moravia a few days ago was inevitable. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Slovak Consul in London, Mr. Hammin, who yesterday made the comment that "the voices of the Slovak people have been temporarily silenced due to the blatant abolition of all treaties and agreements," has now been dismissed. Mr. Hammin was summoned to Berlin on September 1, but he refused to comply. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Internal Disagreements in Germany, Goebbels Loses Favor with Hitler Due to Anti-War Stance</h3>
<p>(Zurich, Switzerland) It has recently been heard that the Swedish Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels, has lost the trust of Führer Hitler due to his opposition to the war and his disagreements with Air Force Minister General Goering and Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder. The fact that he has been silent during this important period proves the truth of this statement. Foreign observers here believe that Goebbels may not be openly condemned, but will gradually withdraw from the political stage, and his vacant position may be taken over by Dr. Weiner, a friend of Air Force Minister Goering. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Former Leader of the Romanian Iron Guard Executed</h3>
<p>(Bucharest) Former Iron Guard leader, lawyer Herziglig, was arrested last night and has been executed. His crime was being the mastermind behind the assassination of Prime Minister Calinescu.

<h3>Dutch Passenger Plane Attacked by German Air Force, German Officials Explain the Truth</h3>
<p>(Stockholm, Sweden) A Dutch civilian aircraft flying between Malmö and Amsterdam was strafed with machine guns by an aircraft of unknown origin at an altitude of 2,400 feet in the sky over the North Sea, 70 miles northwest of Heligoland yesterday. Gustav Rehn, a Swedish civil engineer, was killed. Although the plane was damaged, it still landed in Amsterdam. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German officials issued an explanation last night regarding the shooting at a Swedish seaplane returning to the Dutch passenger plane, stating that "At 2:30 pm on September 26, 1939, the Dutch passenger plane was attacked by a German seaplane outside Heligoland. This was the result of unfortunate circumstances. First, because the aircraft's design was very similar to that of enemy aircraft; secondly, because the weather was poor, making it difficult to identify; and third, because the aircraft entered the clouds after discovering the German aircraft, leading to this accident. However, when the German Air Force saw that it was a Dutch aircraft, it immediately stopped firing." (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>

Although the Japanese authorities have promised to completely drain the standing water by the end of this month, it remains to be seen whether this can be done in reality. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – A Tianjin dispatch reports that the water level in the First Special District is rising rapidly every day. The British Concession has receded by 40-50%. However, on the 25th, the Japanese authorities prohibited the British Concession from discharging water into the Hai River, saying that the discharged water would overflow back into the First Special District from the Hai River, and demanded that the drainage work be stopped immediately. The two sides are still deadlocked. (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>

<h3>A Comparative View of the Two European Wars (Continued) Chen Chuxiang</h3>
<p>England's position has remained largely unchanged, due to its separation from the European continent and its powerful navy. Except for air raids, it is unlikely to suffer other invasions. Therefore, it has sent troops to France to assist in both wars. (In fact, England's intervention in European wars also has its traditional route, which is to rely on its superior terrain and naval power, sufficient to protect the country from enemy invasion, while also being able to transport troops to the European continent to fight. Napoleon's defeat by the Allied forces can be taken as evidence. Although the power of the air force has shortened the distance across the English Channel, the air force cannot occupy land. England has been catching up rapidly in developing its air force and air defense equipment in recent years, so the degree of threat is naturally reduced.)</p>
<p>Now the Polish army has been beaten to pieces, and the fall of Warsaw is probably only a matter of time. (As of this writing, Warsaw is still being defended by Polish forces.) Originally, according to comments from military experts in England, France, and neutral countries, Poland was already considered to be doing its best to resist Germany, given its terrain. Along the 1,900-kilometer border between Germany and Poland, Poland did not have strong defenses like the French-German border. The terrain was mostly open country suitable for the movement of mechanized troops. They believed that Poland should retreat in this situation, shorten its lines, and launch a counter-offensive after the dry weather changed, relying on favorable terrain. They cited the story of Poland's war against Soviet Russia in 1920, when it retreated 600 miles and finally achieved a complete victory in the Battle of Warsaw. They believed that Poland's thousands of tanks could still play a major role in the future. Therefore, their conclusion was that the German army would not easily completely destroy Polish resistance in a short period. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union would suddenly send troops, and the Polish army was finally defeated.</p>
<p>On the Western Front, Germany completely abandoned the offensive of 1914 and repeatedly declared "If people do not offend me, I will not offend them." As for the French army, which adopted an offensive stance, it only carried out local attacks in the no-man's-land between the French and German lines, with only slight progress. The main purpose of the French army was still to probe the weak points of the Siegfried Line, preparing for a joint British-French offensive in the future. French military experts claimed that the Siegfried Line was hastily built and could not compare with the French Maginot Line, which was painstakingly built at a cost of 14 billion US dollars. However, the Hindenburg Line in the last European war was also built in wartime, and the Allied powers were only able to step in when the German army was exhausted. Although the offensive weapons are more advanced than before, are the defensive tools not also? Two years ago, the Chinese army was able to hold out in Shanghai for three months, which shows this point. Therefore, the French army will not rashly launch a large-scale offensive until it has reliable assurance and waits for the British army to arrive with overwhelming strength. This is no different from Germany's attack on France in the last war. At that time, Germany considered that the border with France already had defenses, making an attack difficult, so it forcibly passed through Belgium. Apart from the German General Staff's mistaken estimate of Belgium's strength, was Germany not also acting prudently? In the last war, Germany failed to fully achieve its intended goals in Belgium, and the Russian army launched a major offensive in East Prussia, forcing it to transfer part of its army back east. The Battle of Tannenberg certainly destroyed the Russian army's offensive power, but the strength of the right wing on the Western Front was greatly weakened and its distribution was too wide. As a result, Joffre was given the opportunity to concentrate a large army to cooperate with the British army. In the Battle of the Marne, Joffre drove the German army back to the Aisne River. The Germans themselves could not deny that it was the turning point of the last war. This time, the German army took advantage of the Soviet Union's pincer attack to calmly resolve the Polish issue first, and then concentrate on dealing with England and France, which is indeed much more convenient. What is worrying is whether the Soviet Union will no longer change its mind.</p>
<p>In the last war, England used blockade tactics against Germany, and this time is no exception. Similarly, in the last war, British merchant ships suffered the most damage from German submarines. In recent days, British merchant ships have again been the sole target of German submarine policy. This is originally due to traditional and topographical factors, and there is nothing surprising about it. The total tonnage of the German navy this time is only a quarter of that of England, and in terms of quantitative proportion, it is half as weak as last time. Its submarines are said to be less than half the number of the last time. Therefore, in terms of naval comparison, England and France believe that they have an absolute advantage. Their current problem is only in stopping German maritime transport, attacking German submarines, while implementing a warship escort merchant ship policy, ensuring the safety of their own maritime traffic, and intensifying the blockade to contain the other side. If we hope that the navies of both sides will have some kind of confrontation, judging from the fact that there was only one major naval battle, the Battle of Jutland, in the four years of the last European war, and its result is still disputed by England and Germany, and the truth is unknown, we will probably be disappointed. On land, in order to achieve the actual actions of participating in the last war, England will naturally have to transport troops and military supplies to France to assist. British aircraft, in terms of offensive, will of course very likely stay in France to some extent due to the limitation of distance. In addition to actions on the battlefield, the British Empire has also cut off all commercial ties with Germany. This economic warfare is the main cause of the blockade policy. This blockade line is not as complete as the last time. Germany feels that it has now joined hands with the Soviet Union in the east, and the small countries in the southeast are all maintaining neutrality, which is completely different from the situation of being blockaded last time, which it finds comforting. What will be the future developments and their advantages and disadvantages? It is impossible to foresee for the time being. According to the saying that "onlookers see most of the game," the Japanese military experts' comment that Hitler is a "land-based figure" who ignores the decisive power of the British and French navies, when viewed in conjunction with the fact that the British Empire's autonomous territories are all participating in this war, may have its value. Incidentally, it can be mentioned here that propaganda warfare progressed very quickly almost until the end of the last war. Before the start of this war, Germany consistently adhered to its style of last year, filling newspapers with news of Polish people abusing Germans. As soon as the war started, British aircraft flew over Germany twice to drop 9 million leaflets. In addition, England announced that it was preparing for a war of more than three years, and Germany declared that it would fight for ten years. Apart from genuine determination, does this not also have the effect of propaganda warfare? As for the rumored four-power alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan, it is even better material for large-print headlines in newspapers. Tanks were invented and applied in the last war. Now, as soon as the war started, it was reported that 600 French tanks had attacked the Saar region. The progress of the air force, the strong fortresses between France and Germany, the new method claimed by England to defend against submarines, and the application of all other weapons and tactics are even more incomparable to the last war.</p>
<p>It seems that Italy has not yet joined the war. This article has not mentioned it. The axis policy of the past few years and the recently concluded military alliance between the two countries have long led people to have the concept of the division of two major camps: the totalitarian countries and the democratic countries, or the aggressive front and the peaceful front. As soon as the war started, Germany actually notified Italy that it did not need its military assistance. According to Reuters, Mussolini broadcast, clearly pointing out that Germany informed him that it intended to engage in armed force when he was busy seeking a peaceful solution, which led him to conclude that Germany had seriously violated the understanding between Italy and Germany, and therefore the responsibilities he had previously assumed were no longer binding. If the above-mentioned news is indeed true, from the surface of the words, we can compare it with the statement made by the Italian Foreign Minister in 1914: "Austria's operations contain aggressive goals and are inconsistent with the purely defensive nature of the Triple Alliance. In this situation, Italy maintains neutrality." We cannot help but feel that there is a "different tune but the same effect." Now, in terms of facts, Italy has at least temporarily maintained neutrality, and it is said that its border with France has been reopened and its foreign shipping has been restored. What will be its future trend? This is really a question that all European countries value the most. Recently, it has been reported that there are frequent diplomatic contacts between Germany and Italy, and England and France are also showing great courtesy to it. Where will Italy go? Is it also waiting for an opportunity, bargaining, like last time, or is there really a secret agreement with Germany to come out to mediate after Germany has won a complete victory in Poland? In the past two or three years, Italy has been used by its allied brother and has really exerted a lot of effort, but in reality, its own momentum is not as prominent as before. Mussolini is now able to jump out of the whirlpool of war and is praised as the most realistic politician in Europe without illusions. Can he easily let go of this opportunity? The Soviet Union is actually willing to join hands with Germany, which is completely the opposite of the attitude of Tsarist Russia, which resolutely supported Serbia last time. What are the conditions exchanged between the two sides? There is really a question worth asking. If it wants to restore its old territory in Europe, in addition to concluding the so-called secret Soviet-German agreement to divide Poland, it probably will not forget the three Baltic countries and Bessarabia in Romania. Its current territory is enough for its future development, and it is already working on this. In the future, will it focus on domestic development, or will it focus on restoring the European status of the Tsarist era? The news that the four-power alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan was reported in Nanjing is probably a smoke screen for propaganda. If it removes England and France and replaces them with Germany, Italy, and Japan, is it not "replacing violence with violence"? The key figures in the Kremlin will not have carefully considered the key advantages and disadvantages between temporary co-option and officially going to sea.</p>
<p>The small countries surrounding the German border are now all maintaining neutrality, and it seems somewhat different from the situation twenty-five years ago, when the European war started due to the dispute between Austria and Serbia, Montenegro joined the Allies, and Belgium was forcibly passed through and resisted Germany. However, at the beginning of the war at that time, other small countries also maintained neutrality, which is not much different from the present. What will be the trend of the small countries now? Germany is extremely concerned and has already issued a warning, saying that if they have any unstable tendencies, they will deal with them with swift action. Judging from the current situation, when the small countries do not have the certainty of killing a tiger that has fallen into a well, their strength is indeed too small, and they probably will not subjectively get involved in the vortex of war. Spain is also currently maintaining neutrality. What kind of repayment will this exhausted, wounded, and unrecovered dictatorship country give to its allied brother? Due to its geographical situation, it is extremely worthy of attention. However, the most painful thing for the general small countries with both advantages and disadvantages is their geographical location, which often causes the belligerent countries to destroy their neutrality. For example, a Belgian plane was shot down by the British, and the Netherlands and Greece suffered unexpected disasters. The nature of the seriousness is certainly not as great as the destruction of Belgium's neutrality in 1914, but the bitterness of their situation can be said to be equally comparable.</p>
<p>Going back from the small countries to the main belligerent countries, in the eyes of the Germans, England is the most hated by them, just like they hated France at the beginning of the last war. Now, Germany says that France is controlled by England and blindly follows it. Apart from diplomatic effect, is there any other possible explanation for this argument? England and France have repeatedly declared that they will never conduct peace talks with Germany under the circumstances that Germany has created a fait accompli in Poland. But now that the big brother of the Slavic people (the Soviet Union) has unexpectedly come out to support it, England and France are inevitably a little embarrassed. When the last World War broke out, the division of camps was relatively clear. Now, even if we temporarily define Italy and the United States as still being in a similar position as before, and add the Soviet Union and Japan, the international situation will suddenly become "confused." The relationship between England and France and the Soviet Union in Europe and the Far East, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, the relationship between Germany and Japan, the relationship between England and Japan and the Soviet Union, the horizontal and vertical openings and closings, and the choices and abandonments in between are really a "dazzling array" of magnificent views. If you want to give a thorough explanation of these relationships and their destination, I am afraid that only "time" can be competent.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Promulgates Resolutions of the National Education Conference Regarding Measures for Educational Supplies, a Total of Three Measures and Regulations</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference this year proposed matters related to educational supplies, which were resolved as follows: (A) Schools and colleges should seek to coordinate the purchase of foreign books and magazines. The reason given is that during the war of resistance, foreign published books and magazines are sufficient for reference, and it is essential to seek the development of learning. However, in the past, schools and colleges did not coordinate, and purchases were often the same. In addition, many original editions of teaching materials were purchased, which also affected foreign exchange during the war of resistance. In order to coordinate and unify the purchase of foreign books, magazines, and instruments by schools and colleges, and to take into account the balance of foreign exchange, the following measures are proposed: (1) Draft provisional measures for the purchase of foreign instruments, books, and educational supplies by national, provincial, and private colleges and universities; (2) Establish a Foreign Instrument and Book Purchase Review Committee; (3) Schools and colleges jointly establish a Foreign Educational Supplies Agency. (B) Factories and shops in the war zone that manufacture, transport, and sell cultural supplies should estimate the general needs of supplies and find ways to manufacture and transport them. (2) In areas where remittances are blocked, if cultural supplies needed by schools at all levels are supplied by factories and shops, the price can be paid by the competent authority from the allocated funds, based on the receipt voucher and the invoice, after the number of items has been checked, inspected, and the payment amount has been determined, and then deducted from the school's funds. (3) Request the Ministry of Communications to formulate convenience and preferential measures for transportation agencies of water, land, and air transportation for the transportation of cultural supplies in the war zone. (4) If spiritual training materials and important books cannot be supplied by various bookstores, they shall be sent by the higher-level competent education authority. The competent education authorities at all levels shall, according to the required quantity, jointly or independently print them in a simple manner. (5) Simple instruments that can be imitated and applied by schools locally shall be made locally or manufactured by craftsmen. The above-mentioned resolutions on educational supplies have now been approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>The "Provisional Measures for the Purchase of Foreign Instruments, Books, and Educational Supplies by National, Provincial, and Private Colleges and Universities," "Regulations of the Foreign Instrument and Book Purchase Review Committee," and "Regulations of the Foreign Educational Supplies Agency" are recorded below:</p>

The books purchased jointly shall be distributed by the Purchase Review Committee according to the departments of each college and university, not limited to the application. However, the books used as teaching materials may be transferred and distributed separately by the Purchase Review Committee after soliciting the required number of copies from each college and university. (Article 6) Each college and university shall purchase foreign instruments and books in accordance with the instrument and book purchase portion listed in the temporary budget.

(Article 8) The Agency shall order on behalf of the applicant in a quick manner based on the application that has been signed by the Purchase Review Committee and the foreign exchange notice issued by the Ministry of Education. If there are many merchants acting as agents for a common category of goods, it shall obtain at least three quotations from nearby, and choose the one with superior quality and low value to order.

(Article 10) The expenses required by the Purchase Review Committee Agency for official business shall be deducted and apportioned from the budget of each college and university for the purchase of instruments and books, with a maximum limit of 1.5% of the budget amount for the purchase of instruments and books. The Agency may request the Ministry of Education to approve and allocate revolving funds for the circulation of funds needed for reprinting and transportation, which shall be settled on a monthly basis.

<p>Native factory nails were previously in high demand, and standard prices plummeted, once exceeding the 60 yuan mark.

Therefore, the market is quite quiet. Yesterday's quoted price was 55 yuan per barrel, a drop of about four or five yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Deformed steel bars are mainly sold to local construction gangs, but sales to customers elsewhere are also active. Yesterday, the entire city sold dozens of tons. Most of the supply was local, and prices were about 20 yuan higher than before. For example, 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch bars sold for 780 yuan per ton, and 5/8-inch bars sold for 750 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Conduct Late-Night Search in Hong'an Lane, Bazi Road, Resulting in Nothing, Residents Anxious, Situation in Western Shanghai Remains Severe Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ten armed Japanese soldiers, led by two officers, conducted a house-to-house search in Hong'an Lane (between North Henan Road and North Jiangxi Road) on Bazi Road, starting at midnight, cutting off traffic in the lane. Residents were awakened from their sleep in the middle of the night and were extremely frightened by the sudden situation. The search lasted about an hour, and the Japanese soldiers left after finding nothing. When reporters visited the area yesterday morning, residents still seemed terrified.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Police Leave Tianhou Palace</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, a British military patrol was passing in front of the Tianhou Palace at the bridgehead of North Henan Road when they suddenly discovered pseudo-police officers loitering. They were immediately expelled. It is now reported that the matter has been resolved through negotiations by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Police Hires More Japanese Constables</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail reports that according to a Japanese newspaper in Shanghai this morning (27th), the Shanghai Municipal Police may soon add 20 Japanese constables from Fukuoka to its current force. The full complement of Japanese constables should be 301, but there are currently only about 270. A Japanese assistant chief inspector and a head constable will travel to Japan next month or November to recruit Japanese personnel to bring the number of Japanese constables up to full strength.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Driver Still Missing</p>
<p>The situation in the Shanghai Western District, outside the Settlement limits along the extra-Settlement roads, has been unsettled since the pseudo-police invaded and took up posts. Recently, the pseudo-police have repeatedly provoked incidents, and the operation of buses on the Shanghai Western District Caojiadu-Wujiaochang route seems to have become difficult. Since the kidnapping of driver No. 390 of the Route 10 bus on the 24th, his whereabouts remain unknown as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Confiscated Bus Returned Yesterday</p>
<p>On the 26th, a Route 10 bus traveling from Caojiadu to the intersection of Rue Gsffel and Route Cardinal Mercier collided with a "tiger car" (a vehicle used by the pseudo-police). The pseudo-police intervened aggressively, and the driver and conductor of the bus seized the opportunity to escape. The pseudo-police then confiscated the 80th bus, declaring that they would only release it if the company handed over the driver and conductor. It is learned that the bus was released by the pseudo-police late the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation Remains Tense</p>
<p>Routes 1, 9, and 10 buses, which pass through the extra-Settlement road area, continued to operate as usual yesterday. However, the pseudo-police and Settlement police continued to stand guard facing each other, and the tense situation has not eased. Negotiations by the Settlement authorities are reportedly at a standstill, and there is no hope of a breakthrough at this time.</p>
<p>Swiss Women Knit to Support Troops</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that members of the Swiss Women's Knitting Association in Shanghai held their first meeting yesterday (26th) afternoon at the Swiss Club, knitting and sewing clothes to comfort the Swiss soldiers guarding the border during the current European war. The association has scheduled weekly meetings at the Swiss Club every four days and asks Swiss women who cannot attend or engage in any work to donate funds to support the purchase of wool and fabrics.

<h3>Remaining Balance of Loans from Four Banks Still 100 Million Yuan, Remaining Balance in Shanghai Still Over 18 Million Yuan, All Industries Across the Country Revitalized After Receiving Relief</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Loan Committee aims to promote the circulation of capital for finance, agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce in the interior. Therefore, joint committees are established in the locations of various branch banks to handle mortgage, re-mortgage, discounting, and lending businesses. The collateral for loans is limited to agricultural products, industrial products, mineral products, and bonds issued by the central government. Thus, all industries have received relief from the four banks, resulting in flexible turnover, increased production, and doubled exports. Since implementation, there have been significant achievements. The cumulative amount of loans issued has reached 300 million yuan in national currency, and the remaining balance of loans is still 100 million yuan. In Shanghai, the remaining balance is still over 18 million yuan. After adjustments, finance in various parts of the country has become stable.</p>

<p>Prepare for Year-End Settlements After the Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>Settlement and Reorganization of Shops Unrelated to the Overall Market</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement day, and all banks and money shops were closed. Companies and firms were busy handling settlements, and all outstanding debts were recovered. The Shanghai financial market, after being regulated by the Four Banks Joint Loan Committee and the Banking and Money Industry Preparatory Association, has been extremely stable due to the increase in new remittances and legal tender funds in the market. All industries have safely passed this Mid-Autumn Festival, and no unfortunate incidents have occurred, unlike in previous Mid-Autumn Festivals. From today, all banks, money shops, and informal markets for foreign exchange, foreign currency, gold, securities, yarn, cotton, miscellaneous grains, etc., will open and operate as usual. Moreover, after the festival, all industries will prepare for the long-term loan period at the end of October for the money industry. The Money Industry Association has scheduled a regular meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM on October 2nd to decide on the interbank loan rate for August and to set the price for year-end settlements.</p>
<p>Settlement and Reorganization Unrelated to the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday was the difficult settlement day for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Only a few commercial firms in Shanghai have announced settlement and reorganization due to excessive losses in the past: (1) Tongyi Yarn Company issued a settlement announcement yesterday, stating that it has suffered heavy losses due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, making it difficult to maintain operations, and has had to announce a shutdown. (2) Tongsheng Candy and Cooked Food Shop at 1859 Xinzha Road. (3) Hengxingxiang Paper and Sundries Shop at 217 Lagenna Road. (4) Wangsen Photo Studio at 585 Xinzha Road. (5) Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Company at 543 Avenue du Roi Albert. (6) Shenchangxin Cigarette and Candle Shop at Caojiadu-Wujiaochang (all of the above have been reorganized). According to reporters from Daguang News Agency, the settlement and reorganization of the above firms are due to their own inadequate preparations and are absolutely unrelated to the overall market.</p>
<p>Pujiang High Tide, Weather Changes</p>
<p>The Huangpu River experienced a high tide yesterday due to the autumnal flood season. Therefore, the tide rose quite high before noon, inundating the Bund riverbank and the low-lying roads and sewers. Water accumulated on the ground, forming canals. The tide receded after 9:00 AM, but another high tide is expected after 1:00 PM today, and the volume will be significant. Low-lying roads will likely be flooded again. Autumn rain began to fall yesterday morning, and the weather is becoming increasingly unfavorable.</p>
<h3>Representative of World Youth Conference Elaborates on Impressions of European Tour, Chinese Representatives Receive Much Attention at the Conference, All Parties Concerned About the Far East War</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that five representatives of the Chinese delegation of twenty-seven, including Liang Xiaochu, who attended the World Christian Education Youth Conference in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, returned to Shanghai yesterday (26th). According to them, a total of 1,700 representatives from 72 countries participated in the conference. More than half of the Chinese delegation were women. The representatives from various countries were divided into 43 groups, each headed by two chairpersons, a vice-chairperson, and a secretary. Nine Chinese representatives were assigned to various positions. Although Europeans were aware that war was imminent during the conference, representatives expressed deep concern about</p>
<p>The Far East Incident.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation's independent arrival in The Hague made a strong impression on the representatives of various countries. Many of them thought that China had been completely blockaded, and they were greatly surprised to discover that the Chinese delegation consisted of men and women from all parts of China. During the conference, world Christian leaders such as Dr. Mott and Dr. Koo gave speeches. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands read</p>
<p>The Queen of the Netherlands'</p>
<p>Special welcome letter to the representatives of various countries. Mr. Liang mentioned the European war, saying that after the conference, he traveled to European capitals. According to his observations, all countries are preparing, waiting for "the time to take action." He and his fellow representatives encountered blackouts in London in preparation for enemy aircraft attacks. The representatives were most excited when they arrived at Seutaz Port on the Athos II on their way home, as the European war was about to break out. At that time, the situation had reached</p>
<p>An extremely tense state.</p>
<p>Passengers were not allowed to disembark. When the ship docked at Suez Port when war broke out, it was held up for four days, during which passengers were not allowed to send letters or telegrams. At the same time, German Jewish refugees on board were detained in the lower-class cabins by the French authorities. French troops boarded the ship at night to defend it. When the ship set sail from Suez to Djibouti on September 4th, the ship notified passengers that no lights were allowed at night, even smoking on deck was prohibited. When they visited Columbus, they saw that the local youth association building had been converted into a concentration camp, and German people were detained there by the British authorities.</p>
<h3>Grand Rally in Shanghai for the Moral Re-Armament Movement: President Chiang Expresses Extreme Support, Attendees Deliver Profound Speeches</h3>
<p>Since Moral Re-Armament became an international movement, knowledgeable individuals in various countries have generally recognized it as a fundamental solution to various crises. Last summer, a world conference was convened in California, USA. Eight individuals from Shanghai, including Diao Xin-de, Wang Wan-bai, and Tang Ren-xi, were also invited to attend. They have now returned to Shanghai after the conference, accompanied by Australian representative Corbett and others who have come to China. Last night, a grand assembly was held at the Metropole Hotel on Jiangxi Road. Approximately one hundred guests, including leaders from British and American business circles and Chinese education, medical, and business communities, such as Li Denghui, Liu Tingfang, Zhang Jiafu, and Gu Angruo, filled the hall.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the meeting was exceptionally enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Corbett was elected as chairman, reporting on the significance of Moral Re-Armament and the recent developments in its promotion in various countries. This was followed by a unified singing of the pioneer song, the melody of which was extremely powerful. Afterwards, Du Lihua reported on the telegrams from US President Roosevelt, the British Houses of Parliament, and Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, all expressing support for the Moral Re-Armament movement. Subsequently, various speakers took the stage, including Mrs. Du Lihua, Miss Green, Mrs. Merritt, farmer Fillon, Dr. and Mrs. Ferguson of Renji Hospital, Mr. and Mrs. Logan (son of the former Bishop Wu of Hankou), and Miss White of the electricity company, representing the Westerners. On the Chinese side, there were four young people who had recently returned from the United States: Zheng Shuyuan, Huang Yanyi, Tang Minghe, and Cai Wenhao. Lastly, Wang, Diao Xin-de, and Tang Ren-xi reported on their recent experiences and future visions and plans. Because there were many Western guests at the meeting, the entire event was conducted in Western languages. Western newspaper reporters covered the news and took many photographs.</p>
<p>Honesty, Purity, Unselfishness, and Love</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Chinese and foreign individuals supporting the Moral Re-Armament movement gathered at the Metropole Hotel last night (the 26th), creating a lively atmosphere. Colette Beck served as chairman, and numerous attendees were called upon by the chairman to describe the changes that had occurred in their lives after becoming supporters of this movement. It is reported that the Moral Re-Armament movement, under the leadership of its founder Buchman, is becoming increasingly popular in Europe and the United States. Its origins lie in Christianity, and its principles are absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love.</p>
<p>Moral Re-Armament Can Eliminate the Scourge of War</p>
<p>Those who delivered brief speeches at the meeting last night stated that their lives had changed as a result of respecting and striving to implement these principles. The speeches were very interesting. According to the views of the founder Buchman, the chaos in the world is due to a lack of moral re-armament. In order to achieve security, countries must reorganize themselves morally, because the fundamental crisis of the world is a moral crisis. Mr. Buchman once stated in a published announcement: "If a wave of absolute unselfishness sweeps across all countries, then wars can be declared over."</p>
<p>The Source of Contemporary Conflicts</p>
<p>Speakers last night included Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson of Renji Hospital, Dr. and Mrs. Lu Zi, Pastor Tang, and several other Chinese and foreign supporters. Colette Beck himself was also among them. The famous American statistician Marbison, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, strongly emphasized the urgency of Moral Re-Armament. He stated that if moral re-armament does not replace physical re-armament, it must at least be on par with it. I deeply endorse the efforts of Buchman and his group, who bravely declare that only Moral Re-Armament can save the world from destruction. Today's conflicts are a natural consequence of ignoring God's laws. If we continue to ignore them and still seek peace, then churches and religion are unnecessary. Therefore, those of us who believe in God and study history should expect wars to continue unabated until spiritual awakening occurs. In short, the world must be spiritually reorganized before it can achieve continued material progress.</p>
<p>Food for the Refugees is Gradually Becoming Insufficient</p>
<p>A Difficult Situation is Approaching</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its 19th board meeting the day before yesterday. Those present were Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Tang Naikai, Xue Kai, Wu Zhai, Mao Lishi, Yuan Lvdeng, Yan Fang, Li Guangcheng, and Wang Ji. Resolutions included: (1) The standard for refugee food distribution for the first half of September was set at 11 yuan, 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 2 li per 100 people per day, and 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen per refugee per half-month. For the second half of the month, the standard was set at 16 yuan, 7 jiao, 9 fen, and 1 li per 100 people per day, and 1 yuan and 5 jiao per refugee per half-month. (2) The number of refugees receiving food rations will not be restricted for the refugee maternity hospital and the association's first and second shelters. The number of refugee children in middle school should be based on 1708 people from the first half of September. All other numbers should be based on the number of refugees from the first half of September as the maximum and can only decrease, not increase. (3) Mr. Michael stated that the Nanshi refugee area is currently facing a shortage of funds because the July issue of the charity lottery has been suspended. He proposed requesting the association to purchase 300 tons of Saigon rice from the association at the exchange rate of the seven-member delegation. A public decision was requested. It was resolved that the Saigon rice ordered by the association is specifically for the use of the association's refugee food distribution, and the quantity is only 1,000 tons, which is only enough for a few months of food distribution based on the current number of refugees. The request to purchase 300 tons of rice is difficult to approve. However, since both the Nanshi area and the association aim to relieve refugees, the association should do its best to assist. It was decided to lend 500 bags of Saigon rice to the Nanshi refugee area. If the area requests assistance from the association due to financial difficulties in the future, the association will consider it. The rest is omitted.</p>

<p>Rumor that a Shanghai-Ningbo Ship Was Bombed is Confirmed to be False</p>
<p>Deping Returns to Shanghai Safely, Moufu Arrives in Dinghai on the 29th</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in the city that a foreign ship outside Zhenhai was bombed by a Japanese warship. Fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai were extremely concerned and inquired about the matter. It has been confirmed that the news is purely a rumor and absolutely false. Since the Moufu ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line shortened its voyage, it has been very convenient for passengers. The various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Purely a Rumor</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo line ships changed their berthing location to outside the port and announced the resumption of voyages, foreign ships have been operating frequently, and both passengers and cargo have been extremely crowded. However, yesterday, it was suddenly rumored in the city that a foreign ship outside Zhenhai was bombed by a Japanese warship. For a time, fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai were extremely concerned and inquired about each other. A reporter from Dagang News Agency inquired with various shipping companies and learned that the news was purely a rumor. Although Japanese warships are sometimes seen outside Zhenhai, there has been no activity, let alone attacks on merchant ships. The situation there is still safe. The rumor is absolutely false.</p>
<p>Deping Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Deping ship of the Zhongyi Shipping Company sailed from Shanghai to Zhenhai in October and anchored off Qiliyu to wait for unloading and loading. It has been more than a month. The ship was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 24th, but was delayed until yesterday morning due to insufficient loading. It arrived safely in Shanghai last night at around 10 pm and berthed at the Bund Garden Pier. Some said that the foreign ship bombed in yesterday's rumor was the Deping ship, but this proves that it is nonsense.</p>
<p>Voyage Shortened</p>
<p>Because Shanghai-Ningbo ships unload cargo in order outside the port, the voyage is extremely slow, and passengers are delayed, making round trips extremely inconvenient. In order to facilitate travel, the German merchant Lihua Foreign Firm's Moufu ship decided to shorten its voyage. The ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 29th and will still sail to Ningbo on the first day of the month. Fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai were pleased to hear the news. Yesterday, there was a crowd of people asking for insurance policies at the ship's ticket agency on Ningbo Road. It is reported that tickets will be sold starting today, and it is also learned that other ships will also follow suit, which will greatly facilitate travel between Shanghai and Ningbo.</p>
<p>German Consulate Forbids German Nationals from Communicating with Neutral Countries</p>
<p>The German Embassy in China yesterday notified German nationals in Shanghai that if any German national wishes to inquire about the situation of their relatives or businesses within "enemy territory," they may submit a letter to the Consul General for assistance. They should not independently communicate with the authorities of neutral countries, for fear that such letters will leak German information.</p>
<h3>National Grain Harvest, Partial Establishment of Warehouses for Storage: Encouraging the Establishment of Agricultural Warehouses to Regulate Surpluses and Deficits and Balance Needs</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that most provinces have had abundant grain harvests this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, through the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, has drafted purchase measures to avoid harming farmers due to low grain prices and to accumulate reserves to prevent famine years. These measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan and have been circulated by the Ministry to various provinces and cities for compliance. The measures also encourage the establishment of warehouses to store and pledge grain, crack down on hoarding, and stabilize prices. This approach is beneficial to wartime food supply. The grain needed in Shanghai is mostly transported from nearby occupied areas, which is not affected. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Handling Transport, Sales, and Regulating Surpluses and Deficits</p>
<p>Grain transport and sales agencies should be established in the provinces and municipalities where the provincial government is located, in larger counties under their jurisdiction, or in important areas for grain distribution. These agencies should handle grain transport and sales matters. They should also determine the quantity of exports and purchases based on the actual surplus or deficit situation within their jurisdiction and be responsible for handling the regulation of grain surpluses and deficits. Areas with insufficient grain should have grain transport and sales agencies or local governments work with grain merchants and financial institutions to purchase, transport, and store reserves. Areas with surplus grain should supply as much of the surplus as possible to areas with insufficient grain, and there should be no obstruction between provinces, cities, and counties.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Hoarding and Stabilizing Prices</p>
<p>Grain regulation agencies should provide assistance and guidance to merchants and civilians purchasing and transporting grain as much as possible. When transportation is stagnant, they should find ways to facilitate transportation. If abnormal rises and falls in local grain prices occur due to speculation by unscrupulous merchants, the local government or grain regulation agency should take appropriate measures to stop them. They may also carefully set the highest or lowest grain prices in important grain markets based on the actual situation to prevent manipulation. If private individuals hoard large quantities of grain, hindering the supply of grain to the military and civilians, it may be purchased at a fair price.</p>
<p>Establishing Warehouses to Store and Pledge Grain</p>
<p>Agricultural warehouses should be established everywhere to store and pledge grain. Before they are fully established, simple agricultural warehouses may be set up first, using rural public houses, ancestral temples, or farmhouses and merchant warehouses as grain warehouses to conduct warehousing, pledging, loan and other businesses. Provincial governments should build grain storage warehouses, stipulate phased storage methods, purchase and store grain, and raise funds in accordance with the law to store enough grain to meet the set standards. In addition, they should encourage banks to establish agricultural warehouses, operate grain storage, pledging, transport, and sales businesses, and stipulate that warehouses should maintain close contact with each other and regulate each other.</p>

<h3>British Ships' Import and Export Schedules Are Not Allowed to Be Announced: Secret Orders from the Naval Authorities in China: The Situation Becomes Tense Again, Affecting Business Operations</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the shipping industries of the belligerent countries have suffered greatly, and there has been a crisis of complete suspension of voyages. Afterwards, there was a slight relaxation. Except for ships that must pass through the Mediterranean Sea, which were all suspended, those sailing along the coast of China and to various parts of Southeast Asia gradually resumed voyages with the understanding of the naval authorities. However, the names and flags of all ships have been painted over, and the smokestacks and hulls have also been repainted.</p>
<p>Changxing Company Received Secret Orders Yesterday: Since then, the situation has suddenly become tense again. The voyages and schedules of the Empress passenger ships of the Changxing Company have been kept strictly secret since the day before yesterday. According to yesterday's newspaper, it was also heard yesterday that various British shipping companies, such as the Great Britain Company, Jardine Matheson, and Swire, have received secret orders from the naval authorities in China that the import and export schedules of ships are not allowed to be announced. Therefore, starting yesterday, the various companies have kept the voyages of their ships strictly secret. This measure will inevitably affect business operations.</p>
<p>Irregular Ship Business Suddenly Becomes Busy</p>
<p>Therefore, irregular ships can take the opportunity to make profits. It is reported that the American ship Grampian, managed by the Hua Lun Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai today and is scheduled to continue sailing to Hong Kong on the 30th. The Norwegian ship Dapu, also managed by Hua Lun, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and is scheduled to go directly to Hong Kong on the 3rd of next month. The Norwegian ship Sanmin, managed by Lian Shun Company, is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on the 30th, also going to Haiphong. The Norwegian ship Boweike, managed by the Qiacheng Shipping Company on Avenue Edward VII, was fully loaded with passengers and cargo and went directly to Hong Kong on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 25th), and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow. There are plans to add more ships to operate on the South China line, which are currently being planned. Shao Shijun Reluctant to Leave, Rushing to Complete the Handover</p>
<p>Shao Shijun, with the support of someone, has been acting arbitrarily since he became the head of the "puppet consolidated tax bureau," causing increasing friction with the "Reformed Government." Since he narrowly escaped assassination this spring, he has spent very little time at the bureau, entrusting all affairs to the head of the first section, resulting in the bureau's affairs becoming increasingly corrupt. Now, at a time when the "new regime" is in flux, the position of "puppet consolidated tax bureau chief" is being sought after by all parties. According to reliable news obtained from a certain party, the head of the bureau was notified by Shao a few days ago that he must rush to complete the handover by the end of this month. In the future, the position of "bureau chief" will be filled by someone with connections to the "new regime." Japanese and Puppet Control of Vegetable Business: A Market to be Set Up at the Four Banks Warehouse, Forcing Vegetable Vendors to Register</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet authorities are intensifying their control over Shanghai's main food supplies. It was learned yesterday that the "Shanghai Vegetable Market" being prepared by the puppet municipal government is ready to open for business. According to a discussion with a certain freight company, vegetables coming to Shanghai from the countryside will have to pay a "registration fee" at the market, which will inevitably lead to higher vegetable prices. The establishment of the "Vegetable Market" is a step by the Japanese side to complete its control of the main food supplies in the two concessions in order to realize its monopoly plan. The "Vegetable Market" has been decided to be located at the old site of the Four Banks Warehouse on North Suzhou Road, and a wharf will be built so that vegetables transported along the Suzhou Creek can be loaded and unloaded there under control. In addition, several branch markets will be established in the suburbs. According to the Japanese side, after the opening of the "Vegetable Market," the total monthly sales of vegetables in Shanghai will be increased from 400,000 to 600,000 Japanese yen to 1 million Japanese yen after the implementation of this control plan.</p>
<p>Changsha Postal Delivery as Usual: Remittance Fees to Kunming, Qingdao, and Other Places Revised</p>
<p>The General Administration of Postal Savings and Remittance Business recently stipulated the following remittance fees and surcharges for remittances from the mainland to Shanghai or from Shanghai to the mainland: (1) The remittance fee from Kunming to Shanghai has been reduced by 23 fen from 40 fen per yuan. (2) The remittance fee from Shanghai to Kunming is 2 jiao per 100 yuan. (3) The remittance fee for remittances to Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places is 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan (0.1%). (4) The surcharge for remittances from Qingdao to Shanghai has been reduced by 5 fen from 10 fen per yuan. According to a report from a reporter from Xinhua News Agency who inquired with the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday, although Changsha postal remittances are in a state of war, the postal remittance bureau is still issuing remittances as usual. The limit is 3,000 yuan per person per day. The remittance fee is 1 fen per yuan and the surcharge is 1 fen. Regarding parcels from and transiting through Changsha, regardless of merchandise or personal large or small packages, the parcel business section of the Shanghai Postal Administration is still receiving and sending them as usual yesterday. According to senior officials of the bureau, although postal delivery is difficult due to traffic obstructions, the transportation section of the bureau has been in contact with all war zones to dredge postal transportation and find ways to deliver mail. Moreover, the Changsha Post Office has moved to a certain place after the fire, so the postal delivery in Changsha may be as usual if war breaks out there. However, the delivery time will be extended only.</p>
<p>Combustible Materials Found in Classroom</p>
<p>Fortunately, Quickly Extinguished, Averting Disaster: At a certain middle school at 694 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession of this city, black smoke suddenly appeared in a closed and empty classroom at 12:05 am on the 26th. A certain Mr. Jia, who lived behind the school and was not asleep, discovered it, pushed the door open, and saw that the room was burning. He quickly reported to the school authorities, who in turn reported to the police station and fire brigade. They drove to the scene and completely extinguished the fire at 11:20 am. However, it was heard that when the police officers were investigating the cause of the fire, they found some kind of combustible material in the room. In addition to taking it back for research, many believe that the combustible material must have been placed in the room by someone trying to cause a fire at the school.</p>
<p>Woman Asks to Confirm Identity</p>
<p>Zhu Zhengkui (81 years old, local), a real estate merchant residing at No. 4, Yipin Lane, Chengdu Road, Dagu Road, was recently sued in the Civil Division of the First Special Court by Zhu Wang Dabao (38 years old), who hired a lawyer to request confirmation of her identity. The court approved the request. Yesterday, Judge Tao presided over the first hearing. The defendant himself did not attend, but was represented by a lawyer. According to the plaintiff Wang Dabao's statement, she lived with the defendant when she was eighteen years old. Now, she is suddenly abandoned and ignored, so she is asking the court to rule that she is a member of the defendant's family. According to the defendant's lawyer, who has already been registered, Wang Dabao worked as a maid in the defendant's home in 1936 and the employment agency can testify to this. The plaintiff and the defendant have no family relationship and the facts are completely fabricated. The court verified the statements, and the arguments were concluded. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on October 2nd.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Foreign Firms Amidst the European War: Prices of Foreign Goods are High and Unpopular, Resulting in Sluggish Business and a Sharp Decline 一栗</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, Shanghai's industry and commerce have first shown signs of unease. Regardless of whether this is an opportunity for the development of domestic industries, those most affected at this time are British, French, and German foreign firms. Foreign firms have always been regarded highly in the minds of the general public because their business is simple: they are just middlemen in buying and selling, and they can always obtain a large surplus every year. Their employees have light duties and rich incomes (compared to the general situation). However, after the Shanghai War, the business of foreign firms seemed to gradually decline. At that time, due to transportation inconveniences, the prices of foreign goods increased. Recently, due to repeated foreign exchange contractions, the prices of foreign goods have risen even higher. On the surface, foreign firms during this period can make a lot of money. In fact, this is not the case, because the prices of foreign goods have risen to such a degree that customers have become wary of buying them, and the business policy of foreign firms is more serious than before the war. In general, a 20% deposit was sufficient for foreign firms to order goods this year, or even less than 20%. Recently, however, this is not the case. For each item ordered, a 60% deposit must be paid first, and the delivery time is long. Under these circumstances, customers use domestic goods if they can be substituted, and use old ones if they can be saved. Currently, with the outbreak of the European War, merchant ships from Britain, France, Germany, and other countries sailing to the Far East have been suspended. The sources of European goods for Shanghai's British, French, and German foreign firms are not smooth, so the business of foreign firms has suffered a great blow. For the orders that customers have already placed, they have announced cancellations. Sales are limited to the existing goods in Shanghai, but most merchants have a mentality of hoarding for profit because they have seen the precedent of the first European War, where many small merchants became nouveau riches. Currently, those with existing goods such as pigments, hardware, wool, industrial raw materials, and machinery parts are unwilling to sell them and are waiting and seeing. As a result, prices are soaring. The more they rise, the more enthusiastic hoarding becomes. However, in fact, only high prices are heard, but no customers buying goods are seen. It should be known that few people have long been asking about foreign goods, and under the current deformed situation, it is of course even more impossible to talk about them. At a banquet last night, I met a Chinese buyer for a German foreign firm. I took the opportunity to ask him about the business of foreign firms. He gave an example of hardware and said, "The price of hardware has risen by one or two times compared to before the war, but business is not booming. Sales in Shanghai are the largest. Therefore, the business situation is far worse than before the war. At present, with the outbreak of the European War, foreign goods are being hoarded for profit, and there are even fewer buyers. The business is inevitably getting worse and worse." He further said, "German foreign firms have been in a state of stagnation and are now trying to cope with the situation. In addition, they have suffered an unexpected blow, which is the problem of German merchants withdrawing deposits. One of our managers and the manager of a certain British bank were close friends for many years. He once went to the bank to withdraw a sum of money, but the bank manager bluntly said: Friendship is friendship. Under today's circumstances, friendship can only be put aside. We'll talk about it after the war is resolved!" The clannishness of Westerners can be seen. Indeed, foreign firms, which have always been regarded highly, have suffered a terrible fate at this time. Currently, the prices of the remaining foreign goods in Shanghai's mines and ditches are indeed shockingly high, but very few customers are willing to use them. They are just tools for speculators! Chinese people can take this opportunity to strive to manufacture domestic products to replace expensive foreign goods and reduce trade deficits, which is of great significance to the country's finances.</p>
<h3>Disputes over Eviction in Qingyuli: High Court Rules for Delay</h3>
<h3>Landlord and Tenant Sign New Agreement, Tenants File Counterclaim Requesting Investigation</h3>
<p>The Chongqing Road Qingyuli houses leased by the Shanghai Women's Commercial Bank were recently ordered to be vacated due to the bank's need to rebuild. This was met with resistance from the tenants, leading to a lawsuit. After three trials, the tenants lost, and the bank immediately applied to the court for enforcement of the eviction order. However, all 3,000-plus tenants argued that due to the extraordinary times, finding new housing was difficult and they were temporarily</p>
<p>unable to relocate.</p>
<p>This led to multiple conflicts. Last Friday, the Women's Bank surrounded the houses with bamboo fences, intending to forcibly demolish them, which again led to a dispute with the tenants who tore down the fences. As a result, the Women's Bank reported the matter to the police, who arrested three tenants and charged them with destruction of property in the First Special District Court, releasing them on bail of 300 yuan each</p>
<p>pending trial.</p>
<p>The date for enforcement of the eviction arrived again the day before yesterday. The Women's Bank, under police protection, rebuilt the bamboo fences. However, the tenants, unable to find new housing at this time, were forced to have representatives elected by over 3,000 tenants, burn incense, and petition the First Special District Court, requesting a temporary suspension of the eviction. The executive magistrate Peng Shi and chief clerk Cha Liangjian received them and, after the</p>
<p>tenant representatives</p>
<p>explained their difficult circumstances, Magistrate Peng and others agreed to a three-day postponement. The representatives left satisfied. However, for legal recourse, they have filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. It is also reported that the tenants petitioned the court, filing a counterclaim, stating that the Women's Bank and the property owner, the Poor Children's Education Institute, had actually signed a new agreement, extending the demolition period to December 31, 1941. The new agreement also stipulated a 20% rent reduction from January 1, 1939. They requested a thorough investigation. It is now learned that the High Court issued a ruling the day before yesterday (the 26th), ordering the tenants to provide a security deposit of 15,000 yuan, and granting a stay of execution pending the outcome of the retrial. Furthermore, five tenants, including Liu Xiaoda and Huang Yongbin, were summoned by the Chengdu Road Police on the afternoon of the 26th. As there was no criminal suspicion, they were immediately released.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Mother-in-Law Case Postponed for Investigation; Wife's Condition Improves</h3>
<p>Li Guangming, a 45-year-old Hebei native residing at 79 Wenlin Road in the French Concession, who was arrested at No. 322 Jingxingli, Lane 116 on the same road, returned home at noon on the 17th of this month and learned that his wife, Li Jiang (34 years old, from Xuzhou), was still having an affair with Yang Haijiang, a carpenter from Haimen at 128 Zha Pu Road,</p>
<p>carrying on secret relations.</p>
<p>They often communicated privately by phone and secretly met in a room when she went to buy vegetables in the morning. He confronted her, but his mother-in-law, Jiang Xue (64 years old), defended her, causing Li to become angry. He took his service pistol and fired six shots at his wife and mother-in-law, each hitting them twice. The mother-in-law died instantly from wounds to vital organs, while his wife was wounded in the breast and waist. After the</p>
<p>incident,</p>
<p>Li tried to shoot himself, but the bullets were used up. When the police arrived, they arrested Li and sent him to the police station. Li Jiang was sent to the hospital for treatment, and Jiang Xue's body was sent to the morgue. The Second Special District Court verified the report. As no family members were present, the Charity Hall prepared the body for burial. The police then escorted Li to the Second Special District Court</p>
<p>pending investigation.</p>
<p>Further action will be taken after the victim recovers. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Zhang Minsheng presided over the criminal trial in the First Division. According to the police lawyer, the victim, Li Jiang, has gradually improved since being admitted to the hospital and is now able to speak and is out of danger. He requested a postponement for a detailed investigation after Li Jiang is discharged from the hospital. The court verified the request and granted the</p>
<p>postponement.</p>
<p>The defendant remains in custody. As for the deceased, Jiang Xue, her son is in the countryside and has received news and come to Shanghai to claim the body and file a lawsuit with the court, requesting strict punishment of the defendant and seeking damages.</p>
<h3>Juvenile Convicted of Embezzlement, Given Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>Lu Yaoting, a Cantonese aged ten, was formerly a bill collector for the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road, specializing in collecting bills from Westerners. On March 29th of this year, he suddenly disappeared, but he sent a letter to the company's</p>
<p>manager, stating that he had embezzled and used 845 yuan and 98 cents of the accounts he collected,</p>
<p>and that he was running away because he could not make up the shortfall. He also attached a detailed account. The company reported this to the police and requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. The arrest was made the day before yesterday, Lu suddenly went to the Sincere Company to see the manager, and the investigator Chen Guisheng reported this to the Old Gate Police Station. Detective Tao Rubib arrested Lu and sent him to the Special District Court for embezzlement. Lu confessed</p>
<p>without hesitation</p>
<p>that during the New Year, he and his employer and colleagues gambled in a room at the Astor House Hotel, resulting in losses of over 300 yuan. Unable to make up the shortfall, he then embezzled over 400 yuan and went to Fuzhou to set up a shop, hoping to make a small profit to repay the Sincere Company. However, he failed due to the Japanese air raids. Yesterday, Sincere</p>
<p>managed to negotiate</p>
<p>a method of gradual repayment with him, but he was arrested. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, said that the defendant was young, had no prior criminal record, and showed remorse. For the sake of the defendant's rehabilitation, the court should give him a chance to repent and strive to be good. Magistrate Xie Shi-de considered the report and sentenced Lu to six months' imprisonment for embezzlement, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Beggar Steals Thousand-Yuan Bills, Arrested and Sentenced to One and a Half Years</h3>
<p>The Xie Yuanxiang Kerosene Company at 750 North Suzhou Road ordered the old treasurer, Lu A-zhong, to withdraw 1,000 yuan from the Four Banks Joint Savings Society on Jing'an Temple Road at 11:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. When Lu was carrying the money back to the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Ningbo Road, a beggar, Tan Longzhang from Pudong, suddenly rushed forward and snatched the 1,000 yuan in legal tender from Lu and fled. Lu shouted, and Chinese detective Zhang Bingchun and others arrived and chased Tan to the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road, where they apprehended Tan along with the stolen 1,000 yuan. He was taken to the Old Gate Police Station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, charged him with robbery. When questioned, Tan Longzhang confessed that he was very hungry and saw Lu buying mooncakes, so he thought that what he was holding was mooncakes, so he robbed him to satisfy his hunger and did not know that it was money. He begged for leniency. Magistrate Feng Shide verified the confession and sentenced Tan Longzhang to one year and six months' imprisonment for robbery as a warning. The original stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Climbing Over Defense, Beaten to Death</h3>
<p>Shen Baosheng, a local man residing at 58 South Wuxi Road, owned property on the east side of Shenjiazhai, Tianyaoqiao, Xujiahui. After the occupation, he entrusted Ni Songhua (53 years old this year) from Dachang to act as a caretaker. He usually traveled to the concession and had a pass. At around 7:00 a.m. yesterday, Ni left the concession for business, but he did not take the designated route. He climbed over the barbed wire fence. Those on guard discovered this and beat him for violating the rules, causing injuries to his abdomen. He went to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective and he died at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon. The hospital reported this to the French Police, who sent detectives to investigate and took the body to the morgue to be examined. His family will be notified today to claim the body.</p>
<h3>Enjoying the Mid-Autumn Festival, Drunk and Violent, One Punch Kills</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 p.m. last night, many rickshaw pullers gathered in a small restaurant in Gujia Lane on Beijing Road, drinking heavily to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. Unfortunately, they drank too much and became intoxicated. At that time, a certain person甲 quarreled with Xu Huachang (40 years old, from Jiangbei), leading to a fight. Xu Huachang was punched in the chest by甲and immediately collapsed. At first, they suspected that Xu was very drunk, but then they saw his face turn pale and quickly called the police, who took Xu away. The hospital notified the Old Gate Police Station, who took Xu's body to the morgue for examination. When they went to the suspect's residence, he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only the suspect's mother was detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>Boatman Shot, Japanese Soldiers Mistakenly Open Fire</h3>
<p>Shi Yingen, a 36-year-old man from Wusong, made a living by rowing a boat. At around 3:00 p.m. yesterday, he loaded a boat with firewood from Gaoqiao and rowed into the Huangpu River, hoping to sell it at a good price. Unfortunately, he encountered a Japanese patrol boat midway. The Japanese ordered Shi to stop his boat for inspection, but the current was too strong and the waves too high, making it impossible to stop. The Japanese, seeing his haste and confusion, suspected something was amiss, and as they could not communicate, a misunderstanding arose. They opened fire on Shi, hitting Shi Yingen in the abdomen, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse in the cabin. After the Japanese boarded the boat and inspected it, they arranged to send him to the concession at 4:30 p.m. and admitted him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his condition is critical.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues for Legal Separation, Court Orders Out-of-Court Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Zhu Hui-shan, the manager of a paint store at 140 Lane 5, Traffic Road, Shandong Road, was recently sued by his wife, Zhu Wang Rong-ti, through lawyer Zheng Lin-tong, in the civil division of the First Special District Court, seeking a two-year legal separation, monthly support of 150 yuan, and payment of gifted money in the amount of 1,200 yuan. The court accepted the suit, and the defendant, Zhu Hui-shan, also hired lawyers Zhang Yi-ping and Du Xi to file a response, requesting dismissal of the plaintiff's suit and counterclaiming for cohabitation. Presiding Judge Tao summoned them for a hearing and ordered them to attempt an out-of-court settlement. The case was reheard yesterday morning. First, the plaintiff's representative stated that there had been a postponement. The plaintiff's mother and relatives had come forward to mediate, but the defendant was only willing to pay 80 yuan per month in living expenses and was unwilling to pay the gifted money. As the conditions could not be reconciled, the mediation failed. Then, the defendant, Zhu Hui-shan, testified, "Our relationship was originally very good. I have always cohabited with the Qian family. Now Wang has listened to slander and left with the children, asking me for a legal separation. I do not agree, because my income is very small. In these extraordinary times, the cost of living is extremely high, and I really cannot afford two households. Although the gifting of money is a fact, it is not a consolation payment. Although the deposit book is in her possession, my chop is still required for withdrawals to take effect. Now I want to revoke the gift of money in accordance with Article 408, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code." The court reviewed the arguments and postponed the case for further out-of-court reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, the hearing will be resumed on October 6.</p>
<h3>Opium Hidden in Shoe Heels, Still Discovered</h3>
<p>Shen Xi-lang, a Shanghai native and shoemaker, hid six packages of opium (weighing six ounces) inside specially made black leather shoe heels on the morning of the 25th of this month and put them on his feet. He walked to the Bund near Beijing Road when he was surrounded by the public. The Chinese police officer No. 2981 arrived and arrested him. Four ounces of opium were dug out of the hollow in the shoe heel. He was taken to the police station and charged with drug trafficking. The defendant admitted that his old mother was sick and had ordered him to buy it in West Shanghai for her to smoke. The inspections on the road were very strict, so he designed a hollowed-out shoe heel to hide it, but he was still discovered. He begged the court to commute the sentence. Magistrate Feng verified the statement and sentenced Shen Xi-lang to six months imprisonment for possession of opium, allowing him to commute the sentence at a rate of three yuan per day. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Luggage Entrusted Two Years Ago Still Missing; Zhang Da-zheng Sues Customs Brokerage</h3>
<p>Zhang Da-wei, a 57-year-old Wujin native who now practices law in this city, was ordered by the Ministry of Justice to serve as a prosecutor at the Yichang District Court in Hubei Province in the autumn of 1937. He was then transferred to serve as a judge at the Hankou District Court. He traveled from Shanghai to take up his new post. Due to the suddenness of the journey, he had twelve pieces of luggage worth over 20,000 yuan. As it was inconvenient to carry them with him, he</p>
<p>divided them into sixteen pieces</p>
<p>and entrusted them to the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage at 18 New Yong'an Street in the French Concession to clear customs and load onto a ship for transport. At that time, the August 13th Shanghai Incident had already occurred, but the Nationalist army had not yet withdrawn from the suburbs, and transportation to various places was still convenient. Zhang, fearing that the luggage would encounter accidents or delays en route, specifically requested Yang Hu, commander of the Shanghai Songhu Garrison,</p>
<p>to issue a passport</p>
<p>and handed it over to the customs brokerage to transport the luggage together. Unexpectedly, Zhang did not receive the entrusted luggage from the time he arrived in Hubei until last year, when the Nationalist army withdrew from Hankou. Zhang returned to Shanghai after many twists and turns. To this day, he has not received the entrusted luggage and has no news of it. After inquiring with the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage, they remained vague. He also hired a lawyer to send a letter urging them to investigate the whereabouts of the luggage, but the brokerage refused to receive the letter. At this point, Zhang believed that the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage had committed a breach of trust</p>
<p>and embezzlement.</p>
<p>He hired lawyer Wang Xin-tang to file a self-prosecution lawsuit against Zhu Qi-rong (a.k.a. Zhu A-mao), the representative of the Zhen Da-wei Customs Brokerage, in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, seeking legal punishment for breach of trust and embezzlement, and attaching a civil suit to recover the original items or 20,000 yuan in national currency, the value of the luggage. The case will be</p>
<p>scheduled for trial soon.</p>

<h3>Different Paths  Jin Ye</h3>
<p>"Magicians can all perform tricks, but each has their own unique skills." This principle, when applied to walking, is equally true.</p>
<p>The path of a fool often leads to a dead end. There are several reasons for this: perhaps their eyesight is poor, or they are still asleep, not opening their eyes. They fumble blindly throughout their lives, getting deeper and deeper into a narrow space. If they realize they are hitting a wall and rein in their horse at the edge of the cliff, there is still hope. But if they keep rushing forward, the future is unimaginable. In the end, they will inevitably collide with the point and perish. To encourage such a person, the common saying is: "Died unjustly, self-inflicted disaster; your eyes were not properly opened."</p>
<p>Secondly, a slightly more intelligent person knows (but does not recognize) that there are roads in the world (not dead ends). They do open their eyes and follow existing roads. However, they are quite lazy and only know how to use what is readily available. So, when they encounter high mountains, wide rivers, or the end of the road (not the true end, just the end of a stage), they become hesitant. There is no ready-made road anymore. If they could act like the primitive people described in Zhuangzi, who, when "there were no paths on the mountains and no boats on the rivers," could immediately turn back (ancient people had simple thoughts and there were few humans), but that won't work now. Later arrivals have blocked the way back, so you can't turn around. The only result is being pushed off the road to end in ruin. Of course! Such a person is also not worth emulating.</p>
<p>So, what about those who can stand straight and steady?</p>
<p>If a person is not blind and knows that there are existing roads in the world, that is not enough. They must recognize (not simply know) the history of the road, the reasons for its creation; and they must be able to understand the road they are currently on; and understand the road they need to create and walk. That way, they won't be blind and they won't be pushed off. Unfortunately, even if they don't reach the end, their spirit will endure, and they will still achieve something, allowing later generations to follow in their footsteps. Such people can be called "early pioneers."</p>
<p>Because pioneers need to open up and create new roads, the roads in the world never cease. They can meander left or right, high or low, moving forward.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Maginot Line  Translated by Yi Yuanjie</h3>
<p>In 1914, the French army was obsessed with offensive strategy and despised the method of defending with deep trenches and high walls. Later, when the war broke out, the heavy casualties suffered by the French army were a tragic consequence of the erroneous concepts above.</p>
<p>Since learning this lesson, the French army no longer relies on the flesh and blood of soldiers for border defense, but only on superior firepower and reinforced concrete. Based on the experience of the Great War, they have seen that only by properly coordinating and protecting manpower can they exert maximum defensive value. The Maginot Line is the ultimate expression of this theory.</p>
<p>A Vast Project</p>
<p>The Maginot Line can truly be called one of the great achievements of this century. Just a few simple numbers are enough to show the magnitude of the project. According to an officer who once worked as a supervisor, between 1929 and 1936, about 12 million cubic meters of soil were excavated from underground; about 1.5 million cubic meters of artificial stone were made with reinforced concrete; about 50,000 tons of steel plates were used; about 15,000 workers were hired; the tunnels dug, if made into a straight line, would reach the distance from Paris to the sun; the entire project cost a total of 7 billion gold francs. However, this construction work never ends, and its fortifications are constantly being strengthened.</p>
<p>Impenetrable Walls</p>
<p>During the last war, although the Verdun fortress was bombarded with thousands of artillery shells, thirteen of the eighteen reinforced concrete fortresses remained intact. Therefore, before building the Maginot Line, engineers conducted precise research on the materials used to build the Verdun fortress. They believed that only reinforced concrete structures like Verdun were suitable for the construction of the Line.</p>
<p>But they were not satisfied, and they conducted further experiments to determine how thick the reinforced concrete layer, the steel plate layer, and the soil should be. They used 500mm. Large-caliber short-range howitzers bombard specially built fortresses to test whether they could withstand three shells hitting the same spot. And in actual construction, the outer layer was tripled in thickness. Each of these deeply buried giant towers, weighing 120 tons, was built as a whole. No matter how large the shell, it could not penetrate its solid walls.</p>
<p>Internal Equipment</p>
<p>Inside the Maginot Line, electric motors were installed to keep the internal air pressure slightly higher than the outside, so as to prevent the infiltration of poisonous gas. The cannons in the turrets were mounted on spherical bases, allowing them to rotate freely. The muzzles were embedded in steel plates to prevent the flow of toxic air from the outside. When artillerymen manned their guns, they were just like sailors on warships, unable to see the outside world at all, relying only on officers to direct their movements with a compass. Using reflecting telescopes mounted in steel plates, the officers could see the outside world clearly. They determined their shooting targets based on a gridded map.</p>
<h3>Rainy Days by Jin Mang</h3>
<p>The streets wear mourning garb,</p>
<p>The sky flickers with threads of tears;</p>
<p>Threads of tears sting the burning faces of people,</p>
<p>Eyelashes sparkle with crystal light.</p>
<p>What kind of day is this?</p>
<p>The rain will tell you;</p>
<p>The streets, as silent as a "funeral hall," will tell you.</p>
<p>The rain drapes the streets in mourning cloth,</p>
<p>Somber "funeral attire" covers the passersby;</p>
<p>Silent mouths are made even more silent by the rain,</p>
<p>But the beating heart is still a beating heart!</p>
<p>Let the light rain be even more dismal,</p>
<p>Let the city streets be shrouded in darkness—</p>
<p>Dark clouds will thunder with mighty booms,</p>
<p>Then comes a heavy downpour,</p>
<p>Causing the streets to be flooded,</p>
<p>The flood will wash away all decay;</p>
<p>And the mourning garb,</p>
<p>Will be removed from the sky after the storm,</p>
<p>Removed from the city streets,</p>
<p>Removed from the beating hearts of people!</p>
<p>The telephone protection is very dense, all buried under the five layers of dense stone slabs, and each line has at least two backups. The endpoint of these underground networks is the telephone exchange located 150 feet deep. The equipment inside the exchange is sufficient to provide service for 25,000 telephone sets.</p>
<p>If the enemy invades, the Maginot Line area will be immediately covered by a barrage of fire. Each hidden cannon is like a volcano, ready to spew its flames forward, backward, left, and right. This is not enough; the upper structure of each hidden gun emplacement is also covered by a network of light machine gun fire. If enemy soldiers try to approach the top of the fortress, bullets and shells will suddenly fly in from all directions, making it impossible to advance a step.</p>
<p>Strict Vigilance</p>
<p>In the "Maginot" Line area, sentry posts, alarm points, reflecting telescopes, listening devices, infrared-covered artillery fire, and other defense equipment can truly be described as being as numerous as stars in the sky. Whether it is day or night, there are always the ears and eyes of scouts watching everywhere, and defensive weapons are prepared everywhere. Even though we had announced our visit in advance, we were still constantly followed by mobile sentries on motorcycles, monitoring us for a distance. If we strayed slightly from the predetermined route, soldiers would immediately appear and return us to the original path.</p>
<p>The defense works built in the Alps are truly breathtaking. Caves have been carved into the towering rocks, resembling the nests of terrifying demons. The soldiers guarding the Alps River are stationed there. During the harsh winter, the accumulated snow on their tents can be ten feet thick.</p>
<p>Land Fleet</p>
<p>To use an analogy, the Maginot Line is</p>
<p>like a fleet moored on the border in continuous mountains. Each fleet has scouts responsible for reconnaissance; the front of the line is also densely filled with guardhouses, each guarded by twelve soldiers. Their sole purpose is to resist enemy attacks for three days, allowing the high command to identify the main point of attack. Just like naval warfare, after the scout ships complete their mission, they retreat towards the main fleet. The main battleships of the Maginot Line are the underground fortresses. When the scout soldiers in the guardhouses have completed their mission, they retreat to the fortress via winding mountain tunnels. The area of the line is thirty miles wide. Looking around, one sees only hills and mounds, with tunnels crisscrossing underneath, resembling rat holes.</p>
<p>The diversity of architectural engineering is an advantage of the Maginot Line. The size of the buildings varies, and the methods of camouflage also differ, making it impossible for observers to distinguish the true from the false. From the Jura Mountains to the foothills of the Alps, I inspected thirty hidden gun emplacements and could not find two that looked the same.</p>
<p>Underground Castles</p>
<p>Now it's time to talk about the main battleships of the Maginot Line. It is simply a huge underground barracks. There are several miles of passageways, lit by bright electric lights. There are railway tracks for trains to run on, as well as electrical ventilation, hot and cold water facilities, kitchens, dormitories, warehouses, and so on. The warehouses are stocked with enough food for several months.</p>
<p>The警戒綫 (Jǐngjiè xiàn, "Warning Line") protrudes from the ground, like a periscope rising out of the water. Soldiers are on guard in the watch stations day and night in shifts. If an enemy is discovered, an alarm is immediately raised, and then the light machine guns start firing, preventing the enemy from approaching the hidden gun emplacement. At the same time, the top of the hidden gun emplacement is fully prepared, and soldiers approach the turret and immediately unleash machine gun fire.</p>
<p>Apart from guarding duty, the soldiers' only task is to endlessly dig in the soil with iron shovels. They must constantly build protective works, reinforce barbed wire, and tend to the "bamboo shoot field." The so-called "bamboo shoots" are actually large steel bridges driven into the soil with their tips exposed above the ground. These steel bridges are driven into a slope, uneven in height, to prevent tank attacks. When a tank is stranded on the steel bridges, flat trajectory guns unleash their power, destroying the crawling monster from its belly. If the tank escapes this line of defense, it encounters a second steel thorn line, with mines that can be detonated by a mechanism on the tip of the shoot. The tank cannot escape this difficult obstacle under any circumstances.</p>
<p>The soldiers' resting place "must have the greatest comfort and the least danger." This is a famous saying by General Baudoin, and the Maginot Line has reached this standard. The resting places for the soldiers throughout the line are as far away from the gun emplacements as possible. For example, one fortress is located at the foot of a mountain; while the soldiers' resting place is located on the other side of the mountain, connected by a 600-foot-long tunnel. In such an environment, the soldiers are naturally full of energy and vitality, unafraid of the enemy's attacks. Furthermore, in a fierce battle, if a gun emplacement is invaded by the enemy, there are movable steel doors in the passageways that can be tightly closed, so that the invading enemy is confined to a part of the fortress and does not endanger the entire fortress.</p>
<p>(The above is just a sketch of the outline of the Maginot Line. The entire article is based on the inspection notes of Belgian military expert Robert Leurquin. Many places are not described in enough detail and clarity, which may be because it concerns military secrets, and he deliberately wrote vaguely.)</p>
<h3>Deep Breath by Stevie</h3>
<p>—Random Notes from Hometown—</p>
<p>Take a deep breath! Fresh and clear air.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous. From childhood to the last few years before leaving home, I lived in this hometown every day. However, I have only now realized the loveliness of the countryside air.</p>
<p>It has the ethereal fragrance of orchids in an empty valley, and the cool freshness of spring water gushing from mountain streams. Why not? All day and all night, it dances in the shimmering ripples, swirling in the wheat waves of the fields, and sucking on the crystal dew drops on the tips of leaves... All day and all night, it is filled with the blue and colorful vitality of life; even more filled with the magnificent, passionate, and vibrant life of the countryside!</p>
<p>I curse the city, the smoke, soot, dust, sand, carbon dioxide, and pigeon coops in the city... Everywhere is a pungent stench and a heavy atmosphere. But I also praise it, for making me now feel the threat to my life.</p>
<p>From the two glasses of the doctor's myopic eyes, a pair of stern eyes, and under a twitching mustache, in a slow and heavy tone, I chose a path, returning to the homeland I had left for many years!</p>
<p>So, every day, I walk around in a few vegetable plots, along a row of low trees, extending to the boundless wilderness and distant paths, even facing a clear autumn pool.</p>
<p>At leisure, I count the morning stars in the sky, laughing at them for trembling in the face of the morning breeze; I peek at a crescent moon, moving from the chimney to the treetop over there, waiting for the sky to turn from blue-gray to light purple, and the rosy clouds to faintly appear under the smoky willow trees; I also quietly watch the blue sky reflected in the water, and fish nibbling at the edges of the clouds...</p>
<p>Boundless blue waves in the fields, thatched huts dotted in the green sea, the loneliness of small birds, the mist of dawn, and a few sparse shadows scattered here and there. I do this every day; I see these floating points every time (perhaps they also see this little point of me). Is this my post? And is that their sentry line?</p>
<p>I seem to have glimpsed the secrets of nature; I want to throw myself into the embrace of the earth, the hometown is too beautiful!</p>
<p>Sometimes, a few gunshots cut through the sky, and I smell the odor of millet, which is more stimulating than the gasoline in the city.</p>
<p>I seem to have glimpsed the true meaning of life. I breathe deeply, like the greed of old people, unwilling to let go of even the smallest bit, not afraid of bursting my lungs because the hometown air is so lovely.</p>
<p>Every day, I patrol in a few vegetable plots...</p>
<p>I breathe deeply...</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Love Domestic Films</h3>
<p>— Xiong Jian</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Hu Qiufu, a representative of the Singapore Film Company, came to Shanghai to negotiate the purchase of film prints. I happened to meet him at an occasion the other day and talked to him about the recent situation of domestic films in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said that in Southeast Asia, the world used to be dominated by martial arts films and supernatural films, and only these types of films could make money. However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the overseas Chinese have been extremely enthusiastic about their motherland, and their attention has also shifted. They hope to learn about the recent situation of the motherland and the war of resistance on the screen. Their film company has contracts with the Tongqing and Central China film studios. All "Central" productions, whether newsreels or feature films, are first shown in the cinemas belonging to their company in Southeast Asia. In the past, every film was very popular among the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>As for entertainment films, the most popular in Southeast Asia are historical costume dramas. The subjects of historical costume dramas are mostly popular historical stories, characters, and events that have long been known to every household, young and old. In the past, films such as "Meng Jiangnv", "King of Chu", and "Mulan Joins the Army" were extremely attractive to audiences. Moreover, historical costume dramas all belong to historical events and rarely involve modern politics and society. When the local inspection foundation examines them, things like deletion and editing will not occur.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Hu visited various film companies and took the opportunity to negotiate the purchase of prints. He is in contact with acquiring several costume dramas that are currently being made by various companies. Regarding the future, if there are any good films in Shanghai, Mr. Hu has entrusted director Wu Cun to notify him after watching them at any time. He also told me that he is preparing to contact several Soviet films to be shown in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Ms. Lan Lan Talks About: The History of Drama and "Sai Jinhua" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Leng Fang's Notes, Random Notes by Performing Artists. Work in the Last Two Years</p>
<p>After coming to Shanghai, I began performing on stage when the 40s Drama Society performed "Sai Jinhua". I reluctantly took on the role of Mrs. Klingde. Although I felt that I did not perform very well at the time, my interest in performing was greatly increased. Next, "Love and Death" and "Marriage" were staged one after another, and I played a more important role in each. After the "August 13th" incident, until the national army on the Songhu Line withdrew westward, many colleagues in the art world left Shanghai. I wanted to do as much work as possible in the silent isolated island of the theater world. Up to now, in addition to performing in various drama societies, I have acted in "Women's Apartment", "Sunrise", "Mei Luo Xiang", "Love and Death Struggle", and "Tears of Flowers". I have also directed the two dramas "Demon of Desire" and "Tears of Flowers". This is also my first attempt. Of course, I cannot expect to have any good results.</p>
<p>The first taste of the silver screen I love movies, just like I love drama. I have never had the idea of making movies. Not long ago, Yihua Company invited me to perform in "Women's Apartment." After this attempt, it has aroused a great interest in me. I believe that movies and dramas are sister arts that have a connection. In acting in movies, I can see myself on the screen, and then correct my performance. It is indeed more interesting than acting in dramas. However, when I first stepped onto the photography scene, I felt very scared. The scene was so empty and hollow, which was different from the situation where there were many audiences in front of me when performing a drama. Moreover, the filming work only makes fragment performances for each shot, and emotions are difficult to express consistently, which is not as pleasant as performing on stage.</p>
<p>Feelings about acting in Sai Jinhua These days, I am starring in "Sai Jinhua" at the Xuan Palace Theater. This play uses Mr. Xiong Fosi's script and has been heavily adapted by Mr. Wei Ruhui. In order to make the era of the original work different from the current situation and to adapt to the objective environment at this time and place, the entire play has been cut into four acts while maintaining its brilliance. The content performed is only limited to the life deeds of "a famous courtesan." All costumes, props, and scenery have been borrowed from Xinhua Company this time, which is really a great help that adds a lot of color. However, limited by time - the obsolete Mid-Autumn Festival will be staged at the Xuan Palace Theater. I am afraid that I will not be able to perform my play well. I will sincerely accept criticisms and advice from all parties. In addition, my feelings about Sai Jinhua are that she is very forthright by nature, and because of her rich life experience, her observation of things is very clear. Furthermore, in the chaotic situation under the Allied Forces' entry into Beijing at that time, a prostitute could only do so. From her personal standpoint, it was indeed correct; but when considering the entire matter, I still hope that the audience can take a broad view and should not give this character in the play any sympathy.</p>
<h3>From Zhao Junyu's Inability to Return to Shanghai, to the Reason for Naming Him Little Ox</h3>
<p>— Liu Zheng Hu</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan is on stage, but Zhao Junyu, who shared hardships with Zhao and was inseparable from him, has not been seen. The general fans are suspicious. Now I will write down the reasons why Junyu could not return to Shanghai and the reason for naming him Little Ox in his childhood.</p>
<p>According to Junyu, he is one of the four famous Dan in the south, and his fame is well-known in the pear garden. He first learned the art of the big face, and his stage name was Da Da Shi Kuiguan. Then he changed to martial arts student, then sang Xiaosheng, and in recent years he has been known as Qingyi Huashan. In short, his life's art is vast and profound, which is convincing. Ruquan relies on him as his right-hand man, which is well-founded. I love listening to him perform the Xiaosheng play "White Gate Tower" the most. His appearance is handsome and refreshing, like a jade tree facing the wind. The singing is also very charming (Ziyun); Junyu was originally a martial arts student with deep attainments. Unfortunately, in recent years, he has indulged in black books and especially likes women. Twenty years ago, he was contended by promiscuous prostitutes. Now his color and art are much inferior to what he was back then, and he is hardly mentioned. Junyu has native products to smoke in Yunnan, and the price is quite low, so he can live in peace. Therefore, although he wants to come to Shanghai, he has not been able to do so.</p>
<p>Junyu's grandfather, Gao Shou, in Jian'ou, was known for his kindness in his hometown; his father, Xiaolian, was a famous martial arts student. When I was a child, I watched him perform "Iron Rooster", and I still have a deep impression of it. Junyu is also from a family of actors. His nickname, Little Ox, is said to be because his grandfather Gao Shou once strolled outside and suddenly saw a farmer leading an ox past. When he reached the front, the ox suddenly stopped moving, lay on the ground and cried mournfully, with tears like a tide. Gao Shou felt pity and was surprised by it. He asked the farmer the reason, and the farmer said that he was going to lead him to the slaughterhouse to be sold. When asked about the price, he said that 30 taels of gold would be enough. Gao Shou then used 32 taels to pardon the ox's death and release it to the animal park. At that time, his daughter-in-law was already pregnant and about to give birth. One day, Gao Shou was taking a nap at home, and in a daze, he saw an old ox rushing into the inner chamber. He was shocked and woke up. Suddenly, his family reported that he had a grandson. Gao Shou recalled the dream and named him Little Ox. Although the matter involved superstition, it was quite interesting. Junyu received the family's remaining celebration and was full of talent. It was not difficult for him to show off in the theater world. Unfortunately, he was misled and could not compete with Ruquan at the same time in Shanghai, but was frustrated in southern Yunnan. No wonder Xiaolian often wanted to burst into tears when he heard that he was not coming.</p>
<p>Overview of "One Night Empress" "One Night Empress" tells a lingering and deeply moving story. Under the director's careful handling, the story is quite brilliant. Mr. Zhang Shankun's first direction is such an amazing work!</p>
<p>The story is based on the famous Peking opera "Mei Long Town", but "Mei Long Town" only tells a fragment of Qi Xie's story, while "The Night Empress" goes even further. Not only does the film reverse the self of the Peking opera "Mei Long Town", it also permeates the consciousness of the times. For example, when Li Fengjie was robbed by the evil tyrant Li Jingwu, Xiao Xi called on the masses to work together to rescue her; when Li Fengjie was separated from Emperor Zhengde, she advised Emperor Zhengde to focus on national affairs and not be attached to personal love, etc. It can be seen that the film is indeed outstanding and worthy of repeated aftertastes!</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's "Mulan Joins the Army" and "Fairy Yunshang" have given us very good impressions one after another. In this drama, thanks to the director's giving her more opportunities for close-up shots, her performance is further improved. Mei Xi's Emperor Zhengde is also not an ordinary actor who can handle the role. The suitability of the other actors also shows that the film did go through careful consideration and coordination before production.</p>
<h3>The New Atmosphere of the Storytelling Arena After Autumn Cool</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiu</p>
<p>Hot weather is originally the "confinement period" for storytelling arenas. You think, who would be happy to sit bored in a small room in the scorching heat? Therefore, the storytellers always have a "summer break" to avoid "playing the top millstone," which is laborious and not rewarding. The storytelling arenas are left to second- and third-rate actors to play the role. Now that the golden wind sends coolness and the early autumn weather is here again, the storytelling arenas naturally cannot let it go easily. They have all readjusted their personnel and invigorated their spirits, so there is a new atmosphere worth reporting.</p>
<p>The first good news is that Li Bokang, who has been in retirement for a long time, has now made a comeback and is broadcasting for a certain company. His voice is round and jade-like, and he is becoming more and more brilliant. The second is that Huang Yian, who was once rumored to have disappeared, has reappeared in Huyuan. Li and Huang are both the backbone of the Runyu Society, and the two books "West Chamber" and "Yang Naiwu" have become "unique copies in the country" that cannot be separated. Therefore, whether it is broadcast on the radio or sung in the storytelling arena, they are welcomed everywhere, needless to say.</p>
<p>Yalu has recruited "Shen Xue", "Jiang Zhu", "Tang Feng" and the veteran Sui and Tang Wu Junan, who has just come out of Suzhou. The lineup is new and can be called second to none; only the four storytellers of Nanyuan, Ye Shengxiang, Xu Jixiang, Yan Xueting, and Zhou Yuquan, can contend with them. Huiquan Dazhong, because Yalu and Nanyuan are in front, Mr. Pan has to be extra careful. The big Mid-Autumn Festival will be clear.</p>
<p>The famous storytelling artists of Guangyu Society are now almost all concentrated in Shanghai: like Ye Shengxiang's Jintai, Xu Jixiang's Heroes, Wu Junan's Sui and Tang, and Li Hanchen's Yue Zhuan, each has its own strengths and is enough to call on customers. Now, old listeners are making the most of their resources, which can be said to be "lucky to listen."</p>
<p>Cheyu Society concentrated its elite in a venue in Nanjing, possessing the strong power of "Mei Lan," "Qin Yun," and "Three Heavens." It is enough to compete with any venue of Guangyu Society and Runyu Society. Moreover, each time, new opening chapters are released, and a large amount of "filial piety" is offered every day. Therefore, listeners who like to listen to "singing" all flock to it. Recently, the threshold is like a market, and each performance is crowded. The business is really not bad.</p>
