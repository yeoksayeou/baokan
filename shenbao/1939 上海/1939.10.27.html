<p>述及蘇聯·有一小節，如骸在喉，以吐為快。輒見日方經營之報紙，稱申報為「抗日機關，」為「赤化報紙，」故主張加申報以排擊取締；茲請於論述蘇聯之便，先盡一言。赤化云云，在主張排擊取締者，當然視為罪惡；我人則以為被視為赤化之無論為褒貶榮辱，加之申報則無當。申言之：若二十年來之莫斯科方面，列申報於赤色報紙之羣，我人未以為褒為榮，而以為謬獎：若兩閱月前之德義日集團，置申報於赤化報紙之列，我人未以為貶為辱，而以為厚誣，何也，或獎或誣，皆不合事實也。至於抗日，雖不在本文論述範圍之內，但不妨連類一言者：厭惡日本，或由傳統之意識，或由褊狹之感情，或由何種策略上之需要，此數類者，容或有之，而必不衆；申報則深信絕大多數之申報讀者，無分朝野，皆以日本有侵略中國之行為，始厭惡日本，遂形成抗日；日本一朝以行動證明其放棄侵略，則申報必主張母念讐毒，對日親和；日本而持續其侵略，則深信雖在愛好日本而期望親和者，終於愛莫能助！總之，在此空前之非常時期之中，我人對於主義之辨，門戶之別，絲毫不感趣味；一切友敵恩怨，取舍從違，惟以中華國族之利害存亡衡量之。論述蘇聯，亦以此準。</p>
<p>前論蘇聯，每謂為國際最難捉摸之謎，故其究竟持何意念，究將取何行動，於其意念行動尚未與世共見之際，無可逆覩，不容預言。蓋自蘇德簽訂互不侵犯條的以迄今日，恰足兩月；兩月來蘇聯所予人之印象：突兀也，矛盾也，飄忽也，冷酷也。所予人之反應，有忍氣吞聲者焉，有受寵若驚者焉，有啼笑皆非者焉。凡此既往之作為，除與土耳其之一局為局外所未能了然而外，其他皆屬昭彰在人心目，無待列舉而贅為之說。環蘇聯者，乃於蘇聯今後之作為，各視其可能之影響，各盡其禱祝詛咒拉攏戒懼之神態。夫豈蘇聯擁有蓋世之力量，為他國所萬難抗違，斯彼得風行草偃哉？張伯倫希特勒實予以機緣，而史丹林以次能神乎其用而已。及至今茲，我人猶無以斷言於蘇聯今後作為之將何似；而一般觀察，認為蘇聯既往事跡所未足為窺測其整個意念行動之資者，今得窺測之於蘇聯與芬蘭交涉之結局。誠以蘇聯最為一般所視為主要疑竇者凡二端：一為蘇聯是吾終與德國沆瀣一氣？二為蘇聯是否恣圖擴展而不辭用武？彼行之於愛沙尼亞，拉特維亞，立陶宛諸國者，擴展而未用武；此則聲勢懸殊，無須用武，而不足以證明其不辭用武。彼行之於波蘭者，擴展而用武矣，然因利乘便，無須多力，亦不足證明其不辭用武。芬蘭非愛波諸國之儔也，內而國勢，外而國際，俱堪一戰；若蘇聯恣圖擴展則勢非用武於芬蘭不可矣。故蘇芬交涉之結局，當予世人之第二疑竇以明確之答案。我人無自而斷言答案之何似，然自蘇聯近日所予我人種種觀感推求之：如答復美國總統之電文，雖不着邊際而休休有容；如與土耳其之談判，雖不圓滿而互稱輯睦；如遠東有蘇聯侵脅中國之傳說，雖可置諸不理而自動切實闢謠；如蘇聯駐英大使昨與英外相磋商兩國貿易問題之後，即行決定今日開始正式談判；凡此不相連屬之種種片段，大可掃除一切疑竇。</p>
<p>我人固謂蘇聯之事，最難捉摸；顧於今茲追求解答疑竇之餘，猶欲試作進一步之推論。蘇聯在最近之將來，殆不以赤化國際為亟務；窺彼所亟，亟於二點：其一，視愛沙尼亞。拉特維亞，立陶宛諸國為衛星。以芬蘭國勢之不可蔑視，爰以要求芬蘭不參加反蘇聯集團為政治條件；以取得逼近蘇聯港口之芬蘭數小島。及芬蘭在埃倫特島不設防，為其軍略條件。彼取之於波蘭者，內以總選舉加強其政治據點；外以示好英國，博得英國當局之一再聲明「非為某國界綫而戰；」所謂某國，自是波蘭；所謂非爭界綫，其意殆謂爭波蘭復國，而不堅持其原有之界綫：以此視為英蘇間公開之默契，有何不可。蘇聯擴展之是非曲直，儘成爭論，然彼在歐洲擴展之輪廓，則至今日已得覘知其大體。就此輪廓，力圖穩定與充實，是彼所亟也。其二，蘇聯對德與對英之商業談判，同時並進，此則未可遽以英德之敵對，推論蘇聯之與雙方同時談判，乃為操縱之策略，乃為對德誠而對英偽，或為對德偽而對英誠。世論頗體味之於商業談判之外，以為具有政治意嚮之象徵焉。以我人所觀感，寗認為蘇聯對於英德交戰，不加重視，亦不受拘束；故決不接受德國之訴願而謝絕對英之貿易，亦決不接受英國之條件而停止對德之接濟。總之，貿易與吾，惟以蘇聯本身經濟上之供給與需要為準則；談判成敗，惟以純粹商業性質之盤算是吾有利為準則；除此之外，殆非蘇聯所計。蘇聯誠非資本主義國家，然窺彼其意，盡一切時機，一切可能，借重英德兩國以及任何他國之物資，求其本身成為強健而猛進之資本單位，是彼所亟也。蘇聯今日之政策非如上述歟？誠使我人所論而不謬，則彼在遠東之態度，亦得由此窺見；而所傳進兵新疆焉。對華提何政治要求焉，凡足以釀成範圍廣大而嚴重之國際糾紛者，必蘇聯之所不為，有可斷言矣。</p>

<h3>難童救濟敎養的癥結和改進辦法（四）  錢用和</h3>
<p>師資缺乏　雖童敎養、在抗戰中、是新與的敎育事業、在當初因急於救濟難童的關系、不及嚴擇師資、或就近徵集人員協助、或自告熱忱、願盡義務、所以各院師資、很不整齊、有的實踐畢業、有的高中畢業、有的專科或大學肄業、有的曾在稅局縣署辦差、求得大學敎育科系或師範學院或高中師範科畢業、曾有小學服務經騐者、實在少數、敎師服務團調派人員、資格相當、經騐也多豐富、但對於養的服務精神、還嫌缺乏、所以兒童服裝的不整齊、住所的欠清潔、疾病的易蔓延、大都由於敎職員的缺乏經騐和責任心、就各難童救濟團體和機關所設的保育院敎養院或慈幼院計算、約有七十餘院、每院平均有六級、每級就須敎師二人、每院設院長一人、和事務敎導主任各一人、及其他職員三四人、就得一千三百三十餘人、這一千三百三十餘人的敎職員、具有相當的資格的、或尚不難物色、希望學業優良、經騐豐富、刻苦耐勞、精明斡練、能愛護兒童、視如己出的人、就很缺乏、</p>
<p>用品管理　各院的兒童　旣是全體住宿、一切生活用品的管理、足以表現成績的優劣、無論　書一筆、一衣姓名或學號標誌在物品上、尤其是衣服的縫製、鞋襪的購置、應量配尺寸、更替的時候、或加洗濯、或加曬刷、或加補綴、一一收藏、須井井有條、設法利用、如舊破褥可兩條併作一條、舊衣袴可由大改小、舊襪子可紥拖把、用餘的筆記本、可拆訂、倘敎職員能愛惜兒童的用品、如愛惜自己的物件、並訓練兒童也能愛惜、對於用品管理、不怕瑣屑、有條不紊的處理、就可以節省大批的經費、但現在各院、大都因爲限於經費、發了敎本、沒有筆記簿、備了鉛筆、就無毛筆、冬天襯衫袴、和棉襖袴、只各有一套、穿上身後、旣無替換、又無罩衫袴、結果虱子滿身、棉褲袴汚垢不堪、第二冬就不能再穿、本是節省經費的打算、反成不經濟的事實、其他紙墨紙硯手巾牙刷沒有不須富有經騐的人、云管理分配、才有條理、才眞能節省、道要仗着级任敎師和事務員保育員的密切合作、但許多院或因僻處鄉間、購辦大批物品、很不容易、有了這樣、沒有那樣、或無儲藏室、物品未發、即已散失、或敎職員缺乏管理經騐、往往小孩穿大鞋大襖、分配不當、全院表現凌亂散漫、用品管理在敎養兼施的場所、是佔最重要的事項、</p>
<p>以上所述難童救濟敎養的廠結、如不能高潮改進、將來政府和難童救濟團體、雖費巨款、還是心勞力絀的不易表現優良的成績、改進的方法、茲就重要的幾點、約述如下、</p>
<p>加強搶救效能　在第一期抗戰期間、各戰區附近的難童、由各難童救濟團體、分別派員搶救、並由振濟委員會各救濟區特派員、各地難民總分站、協助接收運送、及給養等事宜、但事實上、因爲交通的困難、交通工具缺乏、各難童救濟團體搶救難童後、每感無法運送後方、保育會設有運接站、往往數百至千餘兒童在運送站等待船隻汽車、其他團體搶救難童祗能從就近的敎養院或慈幼院運送</p>
<p>、爲增加搶救難童交通起見、各難童救濟團體、派員至指定地點、搶救難童時、應先與該政治部政工人員、地方政府·公路局輪船公司·難民站·醫院·診療所·密切聯絡、請政工人員、協助勸導戰區民衆、將無力敎養兒童、速送救濟團體運送後方敎養、地方政府及難民站、照料沿途食宿及安全、公路局輪船公司等配備運輸工具、醫院診療所派醫師護士診治病童、多方合作、使難童得儘量運至後方敎養、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙賣過於買　日商暗中頗多拋售　滙豐沙遜收買不健</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市情况、榮辱互見、趨勢由緊轉鬆、蓋華商在此盤旋機會內、頗願脫手、並聞消息素稱靈通之投機者、會於昔日四辦士緊價、尙作巨額多頭、而今亟思出　、蓋因鑒於歐局、以德國態度、突轉强硬、宜言抵抗到底、故眼前和平允爲渺茫、再觀中國戰事、早入佳境、更以美國最近竭力援華、國際形勢、益見有利、法幣前途、愈覺堅穩、晨開英美滙兌回縮七五、致晨聞局勢遂告英平美緊、嗣因沙遜續來扒進先令、故英金爲狀一度緊俏、至四辦士七五、美匯亦隨縮達七元九三七五、旋以日商暗中拋塞、而沙遜巳無吃胃、又港帮及華商轉賣甚力、市價頓時由平轉硬、加之美行大通及某行均懷賣意、局勢更形鬆動、延至午刻、英金已長達四辦士九三七五、美匯亦出八元關口、爲八元二五、午後鬆勢愈甚、出多進少、匯豐曾吃進五辦士英金、美匯時見八元三七五鬆價、惟經半日徘徊、收盤英金四辦士九六八七五、較上日鬆一八七五、美匯則屬八元三一二五、比隔昨硬三一二五、至期貨交易尚有、趨勢與現貨無異、全天交易尚暢、</p>
<p>美滙重出八元關</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期縮五六二五、遠期降一八七五、紐約銀價跌二五、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法均平、對滬縮一二五、美對英降七五、對滬跌四角五分、對法小一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士七八一二五、美匯七元九六八七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃匯兌回縮之故、開後因西商沙遜續稍有售意、致爲狀似稍帶軟、計沙遜扒進某行現貨英金四辦士七五、同時美滙銀行亦討七元九三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小三分七五、此後沙遜已中止扒結、且有利突代某方吐出、加之美行大通某行亦均懷賣意、致一霎時英金即回長至四辦士八一二五、美滙亦回硬至八元〇六二五、旋以港電亦接踪塞出、並華商亦前來拋售、故潛勢愈士九三七五、美匯八元二五、午刻爲狀稍定、延至午後、銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士九〇六二五、美滙八元一八七五、比晨開英鬆一二五、美硬二一八七五、</p>
<p>英金曾到五辦士</p>
<p>後市因港帮續來吐塞、且投機商前來斬結、故爲狀再度告硬、最硬匯豐曾吸納港電與投機商現貨英金五辦士、同時現貨美滙有利亦吃進過投機商八元二五至三七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士九六八七五、美滙八元三一二五、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金四辦士九二一八七五、美滙八元二一八七五、結果比上日現期英均長一八七五、美俱硬三一二五、</p>
<p>香港申滙續下降</p>

<h3>金市疲莫能興　港帮猛進頹勢稍挽</h3>
<p>昨日現金燈赤暗盤市况、差强人意、結果僅跌四十二元、原因外匯頻鬆、跌仆五十元與一百元之數亦在意料之中、而晚收前反如此堅挺、可見金市上落已成不規則之狀態矣、初開尚平、較上日軋小二元、爲三千八百二十元、嗣以滙市略軟、上漲達三千八百四十元、俄而滙價轉硬、金號及證券帮豐銀樓帮塞出頗夥、市勢突然下降、迄午收已達三千七百四十五元、迨午後做開因賣出仍多、雖客帮拉提不已、但念勢難挽、最小曾爲三千七百三十五元、豈知空穴來風、最後之回漲、異常厲害、港帮來市搜購、數量龎大、雖供吐者亦不乏共人、但終一度抬高至三千七百四十五元、惟結果以三千七百八十元收盤、交易仍旺、的三千兩左右、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌四二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢和平、首由錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲三千八百二十元、較之前收做小二元、少　聞外匯帶軟、目港響亦發動搜買、一霎那抬高二十元、某銀樓進錢兌業五十兩、爲三千八百四十元、此時人氣尚熱烈、詎料外滙忽轉鬆動、而港帮辦胃吃足、加之證券帮出籠猛撳、未久卽盤落四十三元、證券帮售予錢兌業三十兩、爲三千七百九十七元、時錢兌業稍有納胃、兼港帮亦吸進百餘兩、爲狀稍定、一度曾回高至三千八百十五元、此後某金號突來傾吐、且外匯愈形硬化、散戶亦供過於求、一時缺乏維持、竟暴落六十五兀、錢兌業售予金號三十兩、爲三千七百五十元、其時某金號獲利補進、拉起二十元、進錢兌業五十兩價爲三千七百七十元、午刻終因外匯步硬不止、故重引起賣風、證券帮復來拋出、遂再降落二十五元、賣予金號三十兩、爲三千七百四十五元作午收價、午後初開平靜、金號進錢兌業三十兩、仍爲三千七百四十五元、嗣因港帮續來收買、拉起十五元、某銀樓進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千七百六十元、此後港稍暫懷觀望、且外滙趨勢又鬆、引起證劵帮等之賣風、頓退一十五元、會吐予銀樓帮三十兩、價爲三千七百在十五元、入後港帮買興愈濃、乃委某金號與某銀樓及某錢兌業猛進、雖其時錢兌業及銀樓帮等聞外滙英金長達五便士而來拋出、但頭寸仍感不敷、竟猛抬五十元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩價爲三千七百八十五元、後港帮一度止進、立見回下、錢兌業賣予證券帮一十兩、價爲三千七百六十元、將近晚收時、港帮竟再施餘威、又抬高二十元、某錢兌業進同業二十兩、爲三千七百八十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌四十二元、聞收後某錢兌業又吸進銀樓帮及金號共三十兩、價爲三千七百八十五元、全天一百零五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、</p>
<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百八十五元、迨至正午十二時掛小五元、此後未見更動、計大同行改懸三百八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小十五元至二十元不等、</p>
<h3>外幣虛弱</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因外滙復趨鬆濫、英美金鎊、需要减少、英美金票、供給較殷、市况均見疲弱、香港票需要未殷、微趨下降、法郎票有需要、獨呈堅俏、新加坡票羅比票、因滙票趨鬆、跟隨軟弱、日金票供給較增、市况稍軟、晚市爲一元三角一分五厘、朝鮮票仍感稀少、市况微昂、晚市爲一元零九分六厘、昨日市價、英金鎊英金票、俱降五角、美金鎊降一元、美金票降二角、香港票降二分、法郎票升二厘、新加坡票降一角、羅比票降五分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證券　內債上落甚微</h3>
<p>昨日公債暗盤市况、頗爲穩定、其吞吐差額、亦不過二三角之間、趨勢低而復高、人心仍甚堅强、惟環境消息沉悶、多方大都觀望、致升降範圍漸見縮小、又見盤旋狀况、苦無良好消息、前途或將盤小、昨日各帮交易均係零星居多、十一號及二十號買進爲多、天生等始終賣出、大豐及永康等號則爲先進後出、形成檳持之局、結果上落極微、祇丙種略好五分、甲乙兩種略小五分、乙戊種則完全無上落、成交總數則的有六七十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比上日</p>
<p>統甲五八·五五五八·三五　五八·五五跌〇·〇五</p>
<p>統乙五〇·五五五〇·四〇　五〇·五五又〇·〇五</p>
<p>統丙四八·八〇四八·五〇　四八·八〇漲〇·〇五</p>
<p>統丁四八·五五四八·四五　四八·五五　平</p>
<p>統戊四八·九〇四八·七五　四八·九〇　平</p>
<p>股票交易、成交本所股五十股、價爲二十八元七角半、本所所發之領款證、因需耍漸多、折扣漸漸提高云、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市、下午因新賬登塲、趨勢頓轉活潑、價格普形堅挺、但是種向上力未能持久、收盤時市况雖仍堅穩、然巳稍有回落矣、國際信託公司、會得豐、瑞鎔、中國墾殖公司、鋼業曁怡和紗廠等股成交佔全日總額之大部、</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平穩、上下檔各債券、均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日電、今日英商遠束各公司股票掛牌行市銀行股續告上升、麥加利銀行股升二先令六便士、爲七鎊半、匯豐銀行英倫註册股升半鎊、爲七十六鎊、又香港註册股升一鎊、爲七十七鎊、有利銀行股亦升二先令六便士、爲十鎊十五先令、古拉客林傍橡皮股獨降三便士、爲十六先令、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗零星　去路尙健</h3>
<p>紗市繼續前進、同時南方港帮對於粗紗需要、雖屬徵細、然零星吃胃尚健、於是人心帶緊、浙江方面寗波近因船隻開駛、略有採辦、因此有一部份心理、較爲安定、復來拖進、實則連朝下降已鉅、當然有一度反動回振、前途現銷、如果接踵而來、基礎堅固、當可看漲、反之、或仍不晚盤旋之境耳、就目前環境觀測、匯票看鬆、原棉尚堅、兩方仍在抵觸中、</p>
<p>現貨晨開、承上日之漲風、開價即加起十餘元、此時一般搶帽子之流、羣集紛擾不堪、二十支雙馬現貨價爲六百七十三元、旋以外滙開出勿動、賣風忽起、一跌十餘元、價爲六百六十元、少頃市塲謠言又生、皆利多方、買氣復熾、一霎間再到六百七十三元至七八元之間、收盤依然平穩、但其他牌子之紗、仍屬平澹無勁也、査半日間成交統計二千〇九十包、行情二十支變馬漲二十一元半、天女漲十六元、雙地球漲十九元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城三百包、價爲六百七十五元、十支特金城三百包、價爲五百十元、今日有紗一百六十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港四七五　同行　一、四一〇</p>
<p>福州　五〇　寗波　七〇</p>
<p>江西　二〇　內地　六五</p>
<p>統計　二、〇九〇</p>
<h3>棉花廠商觀望　鄕間市價不賤　販運利息日薄</h3>
<p>本棉交易稍淸、各方成交减色、廠方仍無活動氣象、紗價雖則回升、然匯兌又見趨鬆、故廠家心思尚澹漠、但來源雖不斷、而鄉閒市價不賤、加以路途運費捐稅繁重、以致成本高昂、販運商利息日薄日所以市價不能下降、昨日售開火機花及通州花、價漲一元至一元半、蘇北到通花二千四百九十六包、又由北沙運來三百三十包、今（二十七日）有三百包、運往香港、另有火機花四百件、運往天津、茲將現棉售開之盤（鈔票棧交）列左、</p>
<p>通州花一三〇·〇〇　同業　二〇〇包</p>
<p>又　一二八·五〇　一三〇·〇〇　同業　八〇〇包</p>
<p>火櫞花一二一·五〇　一二三·〇〇　同業　五〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、咋日上午匯兌較平、下午又趨鬆長、各同業均以匯兌捉摸不定、故均不擬有所動辦、廠方日來正擬開出棉紗一批、將來或有購辦原棉之可能也、昨日市上交易殊爲靜寂、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市晨初開即呈堅定狀態、先因投機者之購買及現貨交易之良好而漲、後又因股票市塲之高昂、及海外棉商之購買、市况殊爲堅定、結果收盤市價、較之上日漲起八九磅音、印度棉市靜寂、埃及棉市漲二十餘磅音、利物浦漲三五便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　新米湧到　售盤平定</h3>
<p>米市已見定局、乃以前午會一度回跌後、故昨引起本鄕作客出手動辦、自晨迄午納意殊濃、同時更有內地帮吸收客尖、形勢遂反疲爲緊、迨至近午各區新貨絡繹運抵、達四千餘包、人心未免影饗、貨主售意較鬆、結果銷旺到湧、大局成供求相埒、是以收盤行情、未見變化、計做開常錫特新粳仍爲三十一元、次至廿七元、破粳卅元、次至二十六七元、蘇同常崑新粳特自二十九元、次至二十六元、破粳乏貨無市、靑角密種依然三十元零五角、野稻三十一元至三十元零五角、楓嘉百哥特貨二十九元、次至二十七元、松江百哥一十七元至二十六元五角、薄破二十六元、南港白稻一十九元、早破二十五元二三角、特牟尖二十三元半、次至二十一元、特蘆尖二十四元、次至二十二元半、客尖早開蕪湖及南京特貨仍爲十九元八角、及後經內地帮一度吸收、行情遂稍提二三角、爲二十元、次至十八元半、江北尖十九元八角至十九元半、陳元三十元至二十八九元、新元二十六元半至二十五元、全市成交統計不下萬餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈昨市又形挺秀、緣行販以江北產價不鬆、搬運難以圖利、且滬市價碼已低、更有東行之蕪米專利、隨多停止販運、而本街行舖零戶續辦外、內地帮亦以價低通劃續有辦裝、市乃又見上展、但東行以存積旣豐、蕪價回低、故仍隨市零星吐出、因此市氣雖見緊佾、行情只好一二角而已、</p>
<h3>麵粉客盤尙挺　小麥猛漲</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨現粉交易、漸轉淸淡、南北兩帮客胃、尚屬貪取、惟各廠不願多量供給、且客帮前辦之貨、亦未裝淸、故新交易已見减退、市面擯持、本街零批售價、仍袛七元三角、因廠方爲維持起見、尚不增加、統市本客成交、不滿三萬包、客盤續開七元四角、砲車牌仍須七元五角之價、市面正在醞釀中、今日有麵粉八千包運杳港、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨到貨續稀　因產價堅昂、售手一味堅持、大都上棧待機而售、市塲流通貨日見减少、各廠亦因近日粉銷活動後、原料需要較貪、囤戶亦有拉進、市面步昂、統市福新阜豐兩廠共辦常錫京蘇及管店等麥共達二萬餘包、囤戶亦收買五六車、最高價已達十一元、較前猛漲三四角云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆芝蔴　俏疲不同</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆來源時受阻碍、故少大批抵埠、內地銷縐雖無採辦可能、華南辦胃尚殷、本街亦頗熱烈、市價挺進、昨做開蕪湖豆七八百包、價爲十三元五分、太倉豆五百包、十四元、安慶豆二百餘包、十四元一角至十三元九角、歸德豆一百四十包、爲十三元九角、九江遲豆三百包、爲十五元、芝蔴出口去路受匯水牽制、致觀望不動、一般囤胃因之呆手、昨祇本街採取揚州蔴五十包、爲二十八元五角、行情比前市削六七角、</p>
<p>豆子今日有八百包、另有芝蔴一百九十包、生油二千五百四十聽、蔴油二百聽、俱運杳港、又有菉豆一千一百包、運往烟台、</p>
<h3>糖市　片青開千餘簍</h3>
<p>二十八元</p>
<p>昨粗白略鬆、公會划盤本棧現貨五十四元、外棧五十五元、老貨五十四元、轉口貨四十二元半、太古車白B嘜五十八元八角至八元半、車赤荷赤均乏上落、本綿白及本冰俱降半元、國糖片靑開出北海貨一千一百簍、二十八元、比最高價亦小十元之譜、普通惠州白四十餘包、五十三元、聞汕糖有加洋糖稅之說、如果確實、尚有漲望、</p>
<h3>南北貨　桃杏紅棗均漲</h3>
<p>新天津紅棗、近到樂陵貨二批、咋已開出、計恒大四十八包、棗王升至二百三十元、雙福頭戶八十五元、雙祿二戶六十五元、富貴油頭戶四十元、又同益昌開出昌平桃一批、七十五元、馥興祥開出樂陵紅棗十二包、棗王一百四十包、高棗頭百三十元、頭二戶同價、又恒大開出龍王帽杏仁較高者三百六十元、次之三百四十元、苦杏一百二十八元、又雜路紅棗計長紅棗開二十二元、鄒縣府紅呌三十七元半、次之三十六元至三十四元、毫州桃升三元、以五十五元成交、黑棗仍疲、開七十元至三十餘元不一、昨日有糖二千五百包、由香港運來、</p>

<h3>悲壯忠烈重浮腦際　孤軍紀念兩周年　謝團長演說勉各守崗位　滬人踴躍參加紀念典禮</h3>
<p>昨日爲八十八師孤軍在閘北四行倉庫開始孤軍舊鬬之第二週年紀念日、居留於膠州路孤軍營房之四行孤軍官兵四百人、在謝晋元團長之領導下、特於昨日下午三時餘、舉行紀念、各界來賓參加者共百餘人、當時情况極爲雄壯熱烈、茲紀詳情如下、</p>
<h3>四百壯士精神飽滿</h3>
<p>咋日因係孤軍在四行倉庫舊鬥之紀念日、駐守於膠州路孤軍營房之萬國商團白俄隊、戒備特爲嚴密、荷槍白俄商團、不時在四週巡邏、昨日各界來賓代表參加者、共百餘人、並有贈送鏡框等紀念物者、舉行紀念塲所、設於禮堂前之空塲、禮堂門前紮有松柏彩牌、上掛黨徽及總理遺言、是日四百壯士、均精神飽滿、熱情湧現、使孤島人士、重睹國軍英勇姿態、不禁爲之興奮萬分、</p>
<h3>團長演說慷慨激昂</h3>
<p>下午三時許、全體孤軍來賓舉行紀念、首由謝團長致詞、略謂、今天是本團進入四行倉庫開始抗戰的日子、至三十號的五天中、爲在四行倉庫內與對方搏鬥的時期、三十一日即爲奉最高統帥令撤退、也就是我們</p>
<p>慘痛生活</p>
<p>開始兩週年的日子、今天參加的來賓方面、一爲官兵家屬、二爲在本團熱心服務同胞、三爲文化界先進、其他即爲與之同生死共患難的同志、可以說是今天參加的人、都是在一條戰綫上、我們的目標齊一、我們的步驟一致、齊向國家至上、</p>
<p>民族至上</p>
<p>復興圖存、光明偉大的康莊大道邁進、不過各人所站的崗位不同而已、故先要報告的、也可說是一個大家庭經常的報告家務、請各位多多指敎、回想民國二十五年時、本師對上海戰事、就有了準備、當時本師指定的防區、爲吳淞鎭起、東經吳淞砲台、而東北經獅子林砲台、至瀏河·楊林口·七丫口上、本師負責人關於</p>
<p>地形偵察</p>
<p>作戰配備動員運輸計劃等、由元負責、迨二十六年五月間防區變更、由吳淞轉調閘北、在此時起、至八一三止、晋元即在上海附近一帶作戰鬥部署、本師於八一一晚、在錫澄一帶動員、到達上海、後來由元率帶一營死守四行倉庫、旋奉</p>
<p>最高統帥</p>
<p>命令撤退、軍人以服從爲天職、臨難求苟免、雖非軍人的行動、唯余自始即沃定、不論將來環境變幻安危、絕所不顧、國家榮譽、革命軍人人格、必須站作立塲、堅决不稍遷就、領袖的訓示、生死事小、人格事大、兩年來余之一言一動、即本此宗旨與環境週旋、並兩年來的生活回憶、在</p>
<p>物質方面</p>
<p>余等始終未加顧慮、余等所不能忍受者、爲精神的痛苦、余曾三决正式公函、要求釋放、總之、當前國民的責任、就是抗戰建國、也就是國民革命過程中必經的一部艱苦工作、同胞應該不忘記我們先哲遺留告誡我們的</p>
<p>金石名言</p>
<p>「國家與亡、匹夫有責」、二十八個月的抗戰、不是簡單容易的事、凡屬中國的國民、應該各守崗位、竭盡天職、本有錢出錢有力出力之旨、則必能達到最後的勝利、</p>
<p>滬杭路三十四號橋</p>
<h3>業已炸毀</h3>
<p>楓涇日軍被圍殱</p>
<p>西塘平民遭塗炭</p>
<p>由錢塘江源源北開之中國正規軍流動部隊、其向滬杭鐵路區域兩旁進發者、先後到達指定地點、開始積極行動、滬杭鐵路安全二字、已成過去、隨時有被華軍切斷危險、二十一二十二兩日間、有大批武裝全備之華軍、自何處開來不明、向蘇浙交界區之楓涇鎭日軍據點大舉包圍襲擊、事先並有充分佈置、電報綫均被割斷、致楓涇車站之日軍數十名、大部如甕中之鼇、</p>
<p>遭受圍殲</p>
<p>一面並另抽工兵隊、黑夜將石湖蕩以上至楓涇間之兩座鐵路洋橋、加以炸毀、其中著名之三十四號大橋、亦在其中、滬杭鐵路事實上已因橋毀而中斷、華軍於完成重大使命後、凱旋引退、翌晨嘉松兩地日軍得報、抽調援軍、疑華軍來自楓涇以西三十里之西塘鎮、故即派隊向西塘進發、</p>
<p>四週包圍</p>
<p>但該鎭全屬鄉民居住、並無華軍一兵一卒、傅臨去於一部份房屋縱火焚燒、平民頗有犧牲、據前晚逃到上海之災民談、彼等步行至松江、始得乘車來滬、被華軍炸毀之橋樑、正在修理中、故火車在該處尚未能通過、</p>
<h3>郵政局郵差　昨全體怠工　津貼數目要求一律　乍配林未表示意見　今日能否復工未定</h3>
<p>郵政管理局及其所屬各分支局內地局郵差郵役苦力以下全部人員一千餘名、因津貼問題、突然怠工、此事迄昨晚止尚未解決、故今日郵局能吾恢復郵件之運輸投遞工作、尚無把握、事件發生後、捕房方面爲免生意外計、特駛來警備車一輛、並派來中西捕多名、曁探員等、在管理局四週彈壓、迄晚猶戒備中、各情如决、</p>
<h3>怠工原因起於津貼</h3>
<p>昨日郵務差役及苦力以下全部人員之怠工事件、起因於津貼問題、緣郵政總局核准、自七月份起、上海郵務昌薪給、在一百九十元以下起、以迄郵務信差苦力等、普遍津貼七元五角、惟最近上海郵局又奉總局訓令、重行規定、自一百九十元以下之郵務員佐津貼爲十元、信差郵務苦力郵役以下等津貼仍爲七元五角、郵務信差役力等全體人員獲知上項消息後、當以上項津貼、係爲彌補物價飛漲上之損失、與民國十九年因金貴銀賤而增加津貼之性質相等、非同薪給之可分別等級、爰向上海郵政管理局郵務長具呈要求、將信差役力等人員之津貼、普遍改爲十五元、在郵政總局核准前、允照郵務佐津貼例、改爲十元、</p>
<h3>發薪期迫突然怠工</h3>
<p>上項要求、上海郵務長乍配林以須呈請郵政總局核示後、始可照總局指示辦理、在未呈請總局核示前、則拒絕所請、雙方意見因之發生歧異、醞釀至昨晨、因距離郵局發薪（二十八）日之期密邇、遂致發生怠工事件、昨日怠工事件之突發時間、在上午九時、故總局快信掛號平信班、仍照常於八時出發分發、各支局信差早班出發時間因在九時、故即停止出發分送、至十時以後、則郵役聽差車夫機工等人員、均取同樣行動、以致包裹一部出口進口外洋各間工作、咸陷於停頓狀况中、惟各郵務差役人員雖取怠工姿態、然均照常向服務局報到、照常駐局、按辦公時間進退、秩序仍極整飭、</p>
<h3>郵政當局未有表示</h3>
<p>郵務差役等嗣於午後、由管理局直屬之平信組·快信組·機工組·（以組爲單位）支局分局·內地局·（以局爲單位）等十八單位、由每一單位各派代表六人、成立代表團、並由六人中各推主席一人、組織主席團、的束全部差役人員、又悉代表團並於昨日午後四時、在郵局叫樓商談、決定今日繼續向郵政當局請願增加津貼、大通社記者於昨日午後五時前往訪謁郵務都辦王緯生、據王氏談、郵務長乍配林、對差役等之要求、即於本月十八日轉呈郵政總局核示、嗣於本星期二又復去電請示、故在總局未復示以前、自不便有所表示、詎今日突發生此種事件、郵政係爲公衆服務事業、不能片刻或輟、渠相信郵務差役今日當可復工、又謂局方昨日對快信投遞仍照常維持、各股亦照常辦公、</p>
<h3>越界築路交涉　下週開二次會議　工部局建議尙在起草中　偽方先決條件已被拒絕</h3>
<p>關於越界築路問題、就連日發展情形而論、工部局與僞市府妥協空氣、甚爲濃厚、似有即行解決之望、但據昨日外人方面所得消息、謂廿三日晚樊克令與傅筱庵會談時、傅曾提兩項先決條件、要求工部局承認偽市府有管理越界築路全部警務與行政之權、始有討論餘地、當時樊並未接受、且提對案數項、截止昨日、工部局對外宣傳、「對於越界築路之重要權益、決不放棄、」重要權益維何、警權與行政權耳、費利溥所草「建議綱領、」是吾承認傅筱庵提出之先決條件、製作方案、目前固無從獲悉、惟據外交界覜察、因僞方慾望甚奢、交涉前途、未許十分樂觀也、</p>
<h3>三次商談下週舉行</h3>
<p>公共租界當局昨對起草中之解決滬西越界築路問題方案仍保持極度之緘默、拒不發表內容、記者昨謁工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、費氏稱、建議尚未起草竣事、記者詢以將以何種建議向傅筱庵送出、費氏答稱、尚未準備有所聲述、惟另從消息靈通方面探悉、工部局之建議、當於週內送達僞「市府」、而雙方代表之正式會商、將於下週開始、至滬西越界築路之狀况、昨仍保持常態、工部局巡捕、仍在該區嚴重戒備、警備車亦往來巡邏、同時越界築路住戶、覔屋準備遷居者甚多、據悉因恐交涉一告結束後、該區之若干部份、恐不甚適於居住故也、</p>
<p>局方討論建議內容</p>
<p>字林報云、工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、與警務處總巡鮑恩少校、昨日（二十五日）正在草擬建議若干項、旨在解決西區界外馬路之爭執、計劃達最後階段時、將提交「特別市府」「市長俗傅筱庵、預料是項建議、將於本週內交出、據費利溥聲稱、兩當局間未獲若干妥洽時、建議之詳則、當不予宣布、聞工部局昨日午後、曾舉行會議、以期完畢局方將提出之計劃、而準備儘可能早日提交江灣「市府、」</p>
<p>雙方均提先決條件</p>
<p>昨日聞諸負責方面、公共租界當局·傅筱庵·與日總領事·及領袖領事星期一日舉行非正式討論時、傅氏會提出兩項要求、作爲解決界外馬路問題之「先決條件、」傅氏要求（一）爭執區之完全警務權與（二）完全管理權、但據承認、局方並未接受此等要求、且提出對案、對案內容、未經披露、又聞「市府」亦未接受此對案、</p>
<p>車捐展期僅為優待</p>
<p>傅筱庵咋告記者稱、此兩問題乃解決整個難題之先決條件、此等要求、經接受時、渠願研究事件之財政方面、而將探詢公共租界常局在界外區耗資若干與在該區所微稅額、並將考慮「盈虧表、」俾公允解決財務間題、繼續會議日期、未曾規定云、傅氏吾認渠對西區微收「車捐」問題、已予讓步之說、並稱收捐日期、原定十一月一日、僅爲優待起見、渠乃展緩日期、兩個月後、車捐當加徵收云、</p>
<p>西區日捕自請撤退</p>
<p>關於公共租界警務處加强界外警務力、以應付該地法紀蕩然之現况、日文某報曾稱、加派往西區之警務人員中、並無日捕在內　事、茲已確悉、派駐西區之日捕、已於三週前、自請撇退、蓋彼等强烈反對在該區値崗、以其與日方政策相反故也、又英文大美晚報云、費利溥與鮑恩今日（二十六日）繼續草擬預備提交傅筱庵之建議、並無其他發展、</p>
<p>滬西情況依然緊張</p>
<p>滬西越界築路迭次發生之糾紛、深啟本市民衆之注意、自工部局與「上海市府」相互會談後、前昨兩日中、滬西方面情勢稍覺安定、所有愚園路極司非而路大西路憶定盤路等處、除由警務處加派探捕外、英駐防軍並在愚園路口憶定盤路大西路口各建堡壘一處、以資防守、同時身穿黃制服之警察、」則仍在各路口指揮交通、兆豐公園附近、且有手持步槍之「武裝警察」佈崗、故車輛輻輳之極司非而路等地、已呈冷落、而康腦脫路、則反成爲交通要道、</p>
<h3>今日美海軍節　因大局之故決免除鋪張　無紀念程序亦不許參觀</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、美國海軍將守向例、於十月二十七日紀念海軍節日、而表示美艦隊之又有進步與成就、聞駐滬美海軍本年將不從往年之例、由於世界大局之故、現已決定免去常例之紀念程序、而不許美僑登泊滬之美艦參觀、且泊滬美艦逢</p>
<p>海軍節目</p>
<p>例加裝前者、本年亦將異是、羅斯福總統已宣布是日爲假日、美國國內逢此節日、當將照常熱烈慶祝無疑、但在上海、此節日將悄然而過、並無紀念活動、按美國擇十月二十七日爲紀念海軍節日者、因是日爲</p>
<p>美故總統</p>
<p>齊奧杜羅斯福之誕辰、渠在任期內、主張强力發展海軍、而世界大戰時聞名的美國「白色大艦隊」之建立、多爲渠之功績、猶有一事饒有興趣者、美國法律規定戰艦須以各州名稱而定艦名、惟其他軍艦則從</p>
<p>傳統習慣</p>
<p>而定名、如巡洋艦取城市之名、驅逐艦取海軍部長或海軍英雄之名、航空母艦取著名戰役之名、潛艇則取魚名、他如海軍運輸艦取陸戰隊將軍之名、曳引艦取河名、掃雷艦取鳥名、運煤船取星名、醫療艦則以「慈悲」·「救濟」·等爲各、</p>
<p>偽方迫遷難童中學</p>
<p>極司非而路十一號、第三十一難民收容所、一部份、老弱及絕無依靠者、昨日已全部送往惇信路協會第一收容所收容、惟聞難童中學、現遭遇難民收容所之同樣命運、亦已接得日偽通知、限期遷移、主辦善團、爲環境所迫、無法應付、業已決定停辦、對於難童之善後處置、規定有家屬者一律遺散、餘則交由難民救濟恊會敎育處設法安揷、</p>
<p>刦械之風波及邊區</p>
<p>昨日下午三時半、延平路一七一弄內之七百五十四號司開、突被暴徒四人襲擊、刦去所佩手槍一支、暴徒襲擊巡捕手槍之風、似已波及租界邊區、故昨日起租界邊區、如億定盤路·愚園路·勞勃生路一帶、租界方面戒備甚嚴、終日有鐵甲車來往梭巡、</p>
<p>北區問題已陷僵局</p>
<p>日大使館發言人、前日在新聞報道席上、會提及蘇州河北區越界築路問題、謂本已臻於解决之境、以越界築路金洛克事件發生、談判已瀕於破裂、査八月二十二日、日領三浦義秋、曾致函工部局稱「鑒於極司非而路事件、日方决定將虹口區域、展緩交還租界當局」是則虹口區越界築路問題、又已陷於僵局矣、</p>

<h3>糾正「上學」問題的錯誤</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>讀二十三日本報刊潔君「送兒子上學」一文，爲送。個四歲七個月的兒子進一所模範小學讀一年級，結果是爲了該校程度特別高深，超乎敎育部令，爲不能作日記而退級，以致嘆息得沒話可說。這是關係到國家敎育問題，我們決不可等閒視之。筆者當了十數年的小學敎師，敢以所知道的提出作貢獻，來糾正雙方面的錯誤。</p>
<p>先從家庭方面說起，（甲）兒童入學的年齡（進小學初級一年），按照部令規定爲足六週歲。現在潔君的兒子還只四歲七月，當然就沒有進一年級資格，只可讀幼稚園。筆者有一個四歲八月的兒子，連幼稚園都沒有進，原因是爲了居所附近沒有正式幼稚園；有之，也是高貴式的半年非數十金不可，弄得來爺敎書兒子却沒有書讀，也「只可嘆息得沒有話說」。（乙）兒童入學的程度，部令並沒有規定耍能自寫姓名（像我的兒子姓名字筆劃繁多，更難辦到）和識得阿拉伯數碼字，更沒有規定要能作日記（簡直是不通）。爲了不識字，所以要入學。但有些父母，以爲自己兒女聰明，不上四五歲已能識得幾百字，拚命敎讀，以爲便於入學，這也是大錯。須知兒童智力有限，這樣用腦過度，智力大虧，將來要受着思想遲鈍的影響。（丙）兒童人學的目的，是爲要追求智識，培養德性，鍜鍊體格，使他將來成功一個健全的公民。但在上海爲了居處狹小，兒童在家太吵閙，有的於是不顧年齡及其他，送進學校裹去「關蠻」；其實學校不是兒童的監牢，做父親允其是母親放棄敎育子女的責任，以便自由享樂打麻張看大戲，那是不應當的。</p>
<p>再從學校方面來說：（甲）入學年齡部令旣有規定，該校長在先不可允許潔君的兒子入學，在後也不必因不會作日記而退級，直截了當的說：「令郎的年齡大小，恐進一年級還不相宜。」我想潔君也定沒甚話說了。（乙）論入學程度，其實根本沒有標準。在上海一般辦學者，往往因開學時，報名進一年級的粉至沓來，而其他年級揷班的不多，對於學費收入不免减少，而對敎員分配，亦屬困難。還是定出一個超乎部令的特別標準來定取捨。結果，收入的一年生却有二年生程度，敎員可偷懶不用擔任初步啟蒙工作，校長還可誇張本校程度「確乎深一些」。糾正的辦法，便是定出學額，不問程度，到了報名滿額，便不再收。而敎員施敎，也應以未曾入學不識一字者爲水準，這就要憑當敎員者的經騐和良心了。（丙）敎員是淸苦的，淸在努力工作無人見，苦在酬報菲薄，但若一想到爲國家教育訓練一般小國民，使將來成健全公民，也就精神上得到一種自然的愉快，那麼對一般不明敎育的學童，父母，應爲之解釋，使他們知道子女受敎育的重要性，並非是「關蠻」，或識得幾個字，以及將來靠之生活而已矣。</p>
<p>末了筆者對於潔君所提那所模範小學，不但一年生要會作日記，而且五六年級一律耍讀古文，眞是豈有此理，模範得莫名其土地堂。至於本文的立意，那不是單指潔君與該模範小學說的，請勿誤會。</p>
<h3>聘請家庭教師騙局</h3>
<p>— 鐵證</p>
<p>「上海無奇不有，」這句話一些不錯。眞的，騙局之多，計劃的巧妙和手段的圓滑眞使人難以置信。現在把筆者親身經歷的一件事置報告如下：</p>
<p>要想利用課餘掙些錢，除寫稿外，那末家庭敎師便是我們一般窮學生最希望的理想職業。</p>
<p>失業的人那麼多，要想找個職業的確比上靑天還難。我雖然多方面的請托親友師長代爲留意一個家庭敎師的職位，（自然報紙上社會服務欄也登過）然而帶來的總是一批批碰壁和失望的消息。</p>
<p>二星期前，偶然的在報紙上見到聘請家庭敎師的廣告。每月有二十塊錢，祗要每天敎一個鐘點英文，而且祇有兩個初中學生。於是就懷了一個興奮跳動的心按照報上的地址造訪。</p>
<p>是一個派頭十足的公館，小洋房，地點很淸幽恬靜的。當我投過名刺和說明來意後，走出來招待的是一個四十歲以上穿着畢挺西裝，彬彬有禮的中年人。</p>
<p>談話開始了。</p>
<p>『先生，你原來有職業嗎？』</p>
<p>『不，我在讀書。』</p>
<p>『什麽學校？』</p>
<p>『××大學。』</p>
<p>『什麽系？』</p>
<p>『××系。』</p>
<p>『喔！好極了，好極了！』停了一會，『你有敎學經騐嗎？』</p>
<p>『以前也會担任過家庭敎師。』</p>
<p>『喔！那敎兩個初中的英文是不成問題的。』接着是『你讀那些英文名著？』</p>
<p>於是我就背了一連串。</p>
<p>『那末我們用英語來談一會吧。』</p>
<p>自然，他想測騐我的程度了。的確，測騐一個人的英語程度，會話是一種最簡便而又準確的方法。</p>
<p>會話完畢後，他立刻談了一大套恭維和讚美的話。之後又像法官審囚犯般的問了我許多不相干的話。</p>
<p>最後這樣決定了：試敎一星期後再決定是吾聘請，在試敎期內有車錢津貼。</p>
<p>雖然這是一個很苛刻的要求，但也終於忍耐着接受下來。而且自己還這般地憨想：試敎是應該的，免得拿了錢還誤人家的學業。</p>
<p>這樣，我就每天規定的時間內去敎兩個初中學生的英文。自然，敎授是很認眞的，一點也不馬虎，苟且。自己承認，盡了最大的努力。</p>
<p>忽的，在第七天接到對方的一封來信，內中大意：孩子有病，呌我暫時勿去，病愈後再通知。於是我就每天期待着孩子痊愈的消息。</p>
<p>前天，遇到老友沈君，（他在某敎會大學外國文學系肄業，英語程度確不錯，是中學時代同學。）才揭開了這騙局的黑慕。</p>
<p>同樣的，沈君的應徵，也是見到報紙上聘請家庭敎師的消息。可憐的，也祇有六天，就被同樣的一封信而打破了家庭敎師的迷夢和二十塊錢的幻想和憧憬。再回憶起孩子第一天上課時的話：『先生！父親眞嚴他總是，星期換一個先生，說先生敎得不好……你已經是第三個了。』起初以爲是恐嚇和威脅的話，現在却有力地證實了這樣的一個騙局：不費分文的先在報紙上社會服務欄內登聘請家庭敎師，在應徵者從中選擇（他測騐程度或許會有選擇的意義）程度比較好的令其試敎一星期，然後則藉口孩兒有病把問題擱置而完成其巧妙的騙局，同時，他的孩子也就享受一星期的義務特別敎師。</p>
<p>我雖則損失了一些時間精神和車資，然而却換得了不可買得的寶貴敎訓。</p>
<p>最後，奉告應徵家庭敎師者千萬別再蹈覆轍。要你試敎，也祇能以一小時爲限。同時，還希望那位先生勿再做那喪盡天良的事。假使再在報上做那套玩意兒的話，那末尊姓大名也就在報上發見的可能。</p>

<p>二十五日漫畫「添新衣」，係鄭定棨君所作，誤排鄭定榮，特此更正。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包笑天</p>
<p>何雙玉道：『原來如此！爲什麽有桂花香呢？遠是常熟獨特的名產嗎？』朱愛人道：『不！以我所知，南邊有好幾處地方，都是從前以桂花栗子著名的。不過現在是更多了，實在無足爲異。我們小時節，只知道杭州有挂花栗子，無錫有桂花栗子，其次，便是常熟有桂花栗子了。杭州是在滿覺隴，那地方全是種的桂花，秋來很有許多游客去賞桂，常常帶了幾蒲包的栗子回來。因爲滿覺隴的鄕民，種桂附帶種栗，栗樹夾雜在叢桂之中，也自然薰着香味。無錫的桂花栗，以媧皇殿地方的最著名。其實果樹就多接種，常常接出很好的果子來。譬如蘋果與梨接種了，便結出一種很甜而很酥的蘋果梨來。玫瑰花與葡萄接種了，便生出帶有玫瑰香味的玫瑰葡萄。諸如此類的果子，已出產了好多種，因此有許多果品，從前是沒有的，到近來纔有。那都是園藝菓樹家的新發明，單就口福而言，近代人比古代人要便宜不少呀！爲了果樹接種的事，有些講人種學的，講優生學的，便發出了一種議論，說是兩個種族的人結婚，所生下來的子女必定優秀。也有人說：這話靠不住，到底是純粹血種的好。不過我們就事實來講，近來我們黃種和白種結婚的很多，生下子女來，倒的確是優秀的多。而且近年來，我們中國人，和歐美人結婚的，也一天多一天咧。」何儷玉道：「要講世界大同，先要消除那個狹隘的種族之見。有許多戰爭，殺人盈野，肝腦塗地，都是爲了種族之見上來的。以爲自己的種族，是世界上最高尚的種族，別人的種族，却是最卑賤的種族。記得十餘年前，歐洲大陸，驅逐猶太人，把猶太人弄得走投無路。好像偌大一個地球上，就沒有猶太人存身之地。這不是都爲了種族的偏見嗎？這種偏激刻窄之心，必然要泯除，方可以說到世界的大同。像愛人姊說的異族結婚，所生子女，並不卑劣。我們的繼母，她就是黃白兩種所生的，她的智慧品貌，一切並不後人。再說，我們兩位弟弟，他們還帶着外祖母白人的血胤，他們也是很優秀出衆咧。』　（一九五）</p>

<h3>環球駐華攝影師赴歐　攝影歐洲大戰新聞片</h3>
<p>— 承曾</p>
<p>美國人素好進取，一切均着先鞭，而於電影界允甚。環球公司駐華新聞片攝製員浩華維那，已於上月間赴歐從事攝取歐戰的新聞片。維氏民國二十三年即派來華，拍攝我國生活景物，及遠東各國之旅行新聞片。四年前當意阿風雲緊張時，氏離華赴菲，攝製意阿戰爭片，曾受重傷，回國後休養半年，始獲痊愈。</p>
<p>中日戰爭事爆發，維氏奉命再度來華，爲環球之駐華攝影師。據渠語人，謂已拍得不少中日戰事新聞片，正擬整理之際，忽接環球公司來電促其赴歐，乃不得不停止目前一切工作，匆匆離華，渠希望在歐任完了，重返美國，與其愛妻幼子，一叙天倫之樂，然後再來中國。渠又云：初度來華時，所得印象不佳，及二次來華後，以攝影師之眼光觀察，所得印象，乃與前適相反，至爲良好。氏爲美國新聞片，攝製員中之一靑年，現年二十八，十七歲時已任新聞片攝製員，迄今九年，經騐豐富，故環球公司遂命其赴歐，担任此最煩難之工作云。</p>
<h3>談談程硯秋　（下）</h3>
<p>— 郭鐸</p>
<p>程硯秋的做　做字包括面部表情，身段，台步，跑塲，水袖，坐墊子各種動作。講到面部表情，它與扮相性情很有關係。硯秋的扮相，雍容端莊，所以表情不善佻薄，而長於表演悲劇。又因性沈靜，富於情感，所以表演悲劇較任何人哀感動人；於幽怨鬱結處，顰鎖雙眉，令人不勝愛憐；一舉一動，異常端重，故飾節婦烈女，最能體貼入微，感人心脾。</p>
<p>講到身段，它又與天賦的體質有關。硯秋的身材，本來較他伶爲長；近年來更加豐胖起來了。又長又胖，身段自難討好，但硯秋能微曲雙脛，以抑其長，服裝寬適，以掩其胖，所以表演時，不但未見失態，反更覺雍華而富有福澤相。</p>
<p>硯秋的水袖工夫，飄颺瀟酒，跑圓塲迅逸絕塵，二者皆已臻於神化。至於台步，輕盈自然；坐墊子，迅捷乾凈；都是超絕的做工，非且夕間可以學得的。</p>
<p>程硯秋的私德　硯秋不但在唱與做二方面得到成功，就是他的私德也値得一談：第一，硯秋對於世事，隨時隨地皆抱謙虛的熊度。唯其謙虛，所以能精益求精，對於藝術有不斷的創作。從事藝術的人，最忌自傲，據說尚小雲就是犯了這個毛病。第二，硯秋對人，富有情義。從前北方名士羅癭公，對硯秋極力提携，後癭公作故，身後蕭條，硯秋戴恩之餘，爲之營葬服孝，料理後事，此事早已傳遍梨園界。舉一反十，可知硯秋爲人的重於情義</p>
<p>結語　最後，我有一點感想：覺得一種藝術的成功，非得經過艱苦的磨練和耐心的研究是不能倖致的。不要怕艱難，不要怕天造地設的阻礙，祇要有決心，不虛偽，握住目標，憨愚地做去，『人定可以勝天』，什麼事都可以成功。我們對於硯秋，不但欽仰他超絕的藝術，允其敬佩他忠於藝術的精神。</p>
<h3>「明末遺恨」觀後</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>關於「明末遺恨」的寫作動機，魏如晦先生在「碧血花公演前記」（見二十五日「春秋」）中已說出所以要寫作這歷史劇的必要原因了，—是有所爲而作也。前天晚上，這戲亦璇宮戲院獻演了，在三小時半的時間中，數百觀衆的熱烈情緒，是給予此劇全體工作人員莫大的安慰；同時證明了「古裝戲」的取材，祇要經過劇作者正確的捨取，以歷史的一鏡子」反映現實，在聰明的「人同此心，心同此理」的觀衆之前，是更受歡迎的。</p>
<p>明季末葉，清兵入關，馬士英，阮大銊等輩的媚異投降；鄭芝龍堅持地盤主義而斷送浙江；以及孫克咸葛嫩娘等「中華女兒爲中華死」的不屈精神，在在和「此時此地的中國抗戰太相似了。雖然鄭成功亡命台灣；孫克咸，葛嫩娘等亦被執就義，但這歷史的敎訓正使人警惕：鄭芝龍挾師八十萬，不允救浙，他以爲自己盤踞福建，可以啖荔枝以安居，然　亡齒寒，這位「明朝在，是做官，淸朝來，也是做官」的「英雄」，終於自食其報，落得「求生不能，求死不得」的錮禁於金陵。孫克咸，葛嫩娘等的失敗，也正是明朝太多祇知有己，不知有國的「做官主義」者。可是孫克咸葛嫩娘等至死不屈的精神，可以永傳不朽！在第一幕中，孫克咸，余澹心要葛嫩娘舞劍時，她說：「這不是地方，也不是時候！」在第四幕爲博洛所執，是「時候」，是「地方」的時候，她雖巳不能使用寶劍這武器了，却是斷舌噴血，駡賊而亡，孫克咸的「我明朝有如此女英雄，我焉得不笑？孫三今日登天矣！」這悲愴激昂的笑聲，將永遠徘繞在我們的耳畔！</p>
<p>四幕戲的編製，也都精緻緊凑。一般說來，以第三幕較差，那是因爲經過一個長時間的過程，要各方兼寫，勢難處處週到。但馬金子這一典型人物得安挿，不但點清了清兵的殘暴，人民的惡敵如仇，而且說明在國家危難之秋，應不分彼此，男女，都要爲國盡忠，雖死不辭。</p>
<p>第一幕在秦淮妓院中，叙明孫克咸葛嫩娘，余澹心李十娘，蔡如蘅王微波三對人物的關係，及淸流派見忌於馬士英，而孫克咸和蔡如蘅針鋒相對，無論介紹人物出塲和對白都簡潔之至。淸兵衝入金陵的高潮，葛嫩娘隱諷孫克咸，在刹那間的緊張和悲壯的空氣抓得很緊。</p>
<p>第二幕鄭芝龍鄭成功父子衝突，該是本劇最精彩，也最討好的一幕戲，父子，母子，叔姪間的忠奸剖劃得非常鮮明，對白亦尖銳有力。就是歌女唱王昭君一節，我以爲可以删去，因爲她不過强調了商女不知亡國恨，而破壞全幕完整的空氣是得不償失的。</p>
<p>第四幕描寫博洛的色迷，及以「無恥」和「狗」等的微妙的諷刺，都很幽默，但激起美娘手刃蔡如蘅；葛嫩娘駡賊而亡；孫克咸從容就義也更有力量</p>
<p>演員中：我以為演孫克咸，王微波，蔡如蘅的施汶，慕容婉兒，屠光啟最好。施汶在第一幕及第四幕落幕時的唸白，激越有勁，浩氣長存。慕容婉兒在第四慕中不知自己之沉落，冀以秦淮姊妹之情，挽救葛嫩娘而不得時，很能狀出弱女兒的愁腸百結的情緒。屠光啟的「狗東西」，為某些人物寫照，呌人痛快！唐若青的葛嫩娘，闊別已久的觀衆或許是第一次看到她演這樣的角色，但是能者無所不能，不過或許排了兩個通宵，嗓音見啞。徐立的鄭芝龍，劉瓊的鄭成菌，章志直的博洛等也都成功。</p>
<h3>藝華之新陣容</h3>
<p>— 文波</p>

<p>（一）王寶釧預期本月內可以攝竣（二）刺秦王，由嚴幼祥親自導演，路明更爲此片費巨金改造面部。此爲一部極悲壯之歷史劇，正加緊趕拍。（三）火燒碧雲宮，此片寫李后產子被害事，將由貂斑華主演，不久即開攝。（四）紅拂傳，原名「風塵三俠」，由孫敬編導。（五）美人計。（六）花魁女，故事極香艷熱烈之至，由嚴克俊導演。（七）傾國傾城，嚴幼祥導演，准在年內開拍。（八）觀世音，係一佛敎巨片，文逸民導演。（九）到火星去，孫敬導演，爲一極有趣味之科學喜戲。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>烏龍院劇中的金銀問題</p>
<p>宋朝黃金的價値，當然不會像現在高到四百多塊錢一換，要合銀價就差不多是一兩黃金可抵白銀的百兩上下。（從前用硬幣時，每元的錢七錢二分，現在要用鈔票向銀樓購辦銀器，也須四元上下買銀一兩了。）不過無論如何，金價總要比銀子高出十數倍以上的。中國未與海外各國通商時，金價漲落，必不能相差甚多。我們且看「南天門」劇中很明顯的唸白，就可知明代的金子差不多是十四換，宋與明固相去數百年，然而金銀的差比，一定不會懸殊過鉅的。試看民國初年的金子，也僅僅只是十幾換或二十換，於此就可見一般了。「南天門」的詞，是「金耳環三錢重，我們這裏金子十四換，三對三，三四一兩二，合成銀子四兩二錢，外我大錢二百。」我今特爲把這一段補叙出來的意義，也就是堅決的證明「烏龍院」劇中招文袋裏所藏的是黃金而非白銀了。即令劉唐給宋江帶來的黃金一錠，也髣髴像台上那個假元寶一般大小，恐怕也要有二十兩上下的重量，我們再按照金子十四換的價値合算一下，那豈不就要合成紋銀的三百兩的數目了麼？這樣才不顯露晁天王的吝嗇，同時又證明我所說的「隨後取出來的，並不是先前塞進懷裏的那錠黃金」二語，却不是我武斷的話呢。　（一二八）</p>
<h3>閒畫游藝界　（二十）大鼓</h3>
<p>— 凍雲撰文　岫烟製圖</p>
<p>大鼓是一種北方游藝，表演的都是些燕趙佳人。說部中關於鼓姬情形的記載，前有老殘遊記，後有啼笑姻緣。</p>
<p>劉寳全·白雲鵬們唱的是大鼓，小黑姑娘·楊蓮琴們唱的也是大鼓，唱詞全是一路的。</p>
<p>哭祖廟·打鼓駡曹之類悲歌激昂的鼓詞，應該由劉寶全等來唱，至於大西廂·黛玉歸天之類，則以纏綿委婉見長，自非小黑姑娘等不可。可是他們忽略了這一點！</p>

<h3>Continuing Advances by Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan; Japanese Troops in Yueyang Show Signs of Wavering; Ammunition and Wounded Soldiers in the City Are Being Transported Onto Warships; Areas West of Wuning City Are Entirely Recaptured by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Changsha – Chinese forces, after penetrating deeply into the vicinity of Yueyang, have launched continuous attacks on Yueyang in recent days, making considerable progress. The Japanese troops in the city are extremely panicked. In recent days, they have not only set fire to and burned all the mountains and forests near the suburbs, but have also dragged multiple field guns originally outside the city into the city. At the same time, they have forced civilians through the puppet maintenance association to transport all the stored ammunition in the city and more than fifty lightly and severely wounded soldiers from the Japanese wounded soldier hospital on Hanlin Street onto warships. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese troops in Yueyang are already showing signs of wavering. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Changsha – During this Northern Hunan campaign, the Japanese troops, while retreating, were forced by the Chinese pursuit to bury their ammunition deep in the mountains. The Chinese forces dug up 2,370 cases of rifle bullets and 479 cases of artillery shells near Fulinpu. In addition, there are still many undiscovered. The state of embarrassment during their retreat can be seen from this. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The Japanese troops near Bailuoji, after being severely attacked and damaged by the Chinese forces, now number only about three hundred, retreating towards Xindi and Linxiang in separate directions. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>

(Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Fighting in Eastern Hebei Is Becoming Fiercer</h3>
<p>Somewhere in southern Hebei – The fighting in eastern Hebei has suddenly become fierce recently. A certain unit of the Chinese forces, since the 21st, has circled around east of Jixian County, attacking Zunhua and Yutian in separate directions. They engaged in fierce fighting with more than two thousand Japanese troops from the Okabe unit and puppet troops in the Lianmazhuang area. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. By the next morning, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards the county seat of Zunhua. An examination of the Japanese corpses revealed more than 270 bodies, including one Japanese military police captain and two junior officers. Chinese platoon leader Wang Jindai also died a heroic death. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Northwest of Taikang Are Eliminated</h3>
<p>Xuchang – The Chinese forces launched an attack on the Japanese troops at Changyingji and other places northwest of Taikang on the 20th. The several hundred Japanese troops relied on strong defenses and stubbornly resisted. The Chinese officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave and engaged in hand-to-hand combat several times. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Taikang City. The area was immediately recaptured, and the remaining Japanese troops were completely eliminated. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Defeated in the Zaoqiang Area</h3>
<p>Somewhere in southern Hebei – More than six hundred Japanese troops entrenched in Zaoqiang rushed to Datun on the 22nd to provide reinforcements. They were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese forces in Kangmazhuang. The Japanese troops were immediately thrown into chaos. At the same time, more than two hundred Japanese troops besieged in Datun, unable to receive reinforcements, were completely annihilated by the Chinese forces. Soon after, the Japanese regrouped more than five hundred troops and launched a fierce artillery counterattack on Datun. The brave Chinese soldiers met them head-on, while another unit bypassed Li Qianhao and launched a surprise attack on the Japanese flanks. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Suzhuang and Changjiazhuang in the southeast of Zaoqiang. In this battle, the Chinese forces killed more than one hundred more Japanese troops and seized two 82mm mortars, more than eighty rifles, and twenty-four artillery shells. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>

After several assaults, they once rushed into Sanshui, engaging in fierce combat and killing many Japanese troops. They also set fire to and destroyed a Japanese barracks. When Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese forces had already withdrawn. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Sihui – A certain unit of the Chinese forces in Xijiang dispatched a team on the night of the 24th to attack the Japanese troops in Xiaomei Mountain, which belongs to Sanshui. After fighting until dawn, the Japanese saw that they could not withstand the attack and reinforced with more than two hundred infantry and more than fifty cavalry. The Chinese forces moved to the vicinity of Liantang and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops, annihilating many Japanese troops by noon. They then moved to Zhuyuanxikeng and other places. The Japanese troops were too exhausted to advance lightly. The Chinese forces are still dispatching teams to guard the Liantang area.

<h3>The Japanese Planes That Attacked Sichuan the Other Day Took Off from a Base in Shanxi; Several Bombs Were Dropped While Passing Through Shaanxi; The Chinese Side Is Conducting a Careful Study</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, a careful study is being conducted regarding the flight path of the Japanese planes in northwestern Sichuan Province yesterday. It is now felt that Sichuan Province may face a new aerial threat. The Japanese previously used Hankou as an air force base to attack Chongqing and other cities in Sichuan Province. Last year, it was reported that Japanese naval aircraft took off from several bases off the coast of southern China and attacked Chongqing twice, but this was never confirmed. Yesterday, Japanese planes took off from a base in Shanxi Province and flew to northwestern Sichuan Province, revealing the possibility that Japanese planes could fly from the north to attack Chongqing. When the air raid alarm was issued in Chongqing yesterday afternoon, 36 Japanese planes took off from a base in Shanxi Province, crossed the Yellow River, flew southwest to Chengdu, then turned east, circled for a long time in Nanchuan, and finally returned to Shanxi via Yingshan and Bazhong. It is generally believed that the Japanese planes dropped bombs when they flew over Hanzhong, an important city in southwestern Shaanxi Province, before re-entering Sichuan, and that this was to explore the possibility of flying from the north to attack cities in Sichuan Province in the future.

<p>Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, Japanese planes bombed Hunan and Shaanxi yesterday. In the morning, five Japanese planes took off from a base in Hubei Province and bombed Yuanling in northwestern Hunan Province, dropping more than fifty bombs, mostly incendiary bombs, destroying two hundred houses. However, as of now, only twenty casualties have been reported. Shanzhou in Shaanxi Province was bombed by eight Japanese planes taking off from a base in Shanxi Province, dropping forty bombs and destroying thirty houses. Another group of nine Japanese bombers bombed Yingji (transliteration), reportedly dropping more than fifty bombs, destroying fifty houses and causing more than thirty casualties.

<h3>The Occupied Areas Are Not Extensive</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to statistics released by the Executive Yuan today, the area truly occupied by Japanese troops in the occupied areas is extremely small. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, twelve provinces have fallen into the war zone, but in these twelve provinces, 97 percent of the land or counties are still under the control of the Chinese government. According to these twelve provinces, there are 1,038 counties, but only sixty-seven counties are beyond the reach of the Chinese government. (Dispatch of the 26th by the Associated Press)</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Cooperation Between the Army and Civilians in Hunan Is the Backbone of the War of Resistance; Observations of an Associated Press Reporter</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A reporter recently went to Changsha to inspect the area and discovered that the Chinese army and civilians are prepared to cooperate to protect the most fertile Hunan River basin from the Miluo River to Hengyang. This area not only has a large military force and civilian manpower, but also has the most abundant harvest in agricultural history this year (sufficient for the province's use for two years, and also able to be transported to Guangxi and Guizhou), as well as a spirit of army-civilian cooperation that the reporter has not seen elsewhere. The combination of the three is more than enough to resist the Japanese army's invasion of the area. When the reporter inquired about the situation of the army and civilians from people from all walks of life, from the county magistrate to the farmer, they all expressed surprise and admiration for the bravery of the soldiers and unanimously expressed their willingness to cooperate with the army. Local farmers told Yu Sheng, "Chinese soldiers are our friends. They help us harvest in place of the labor of our sons who are away at war. When they live in civilian houses, the commanders pay rent." The development of this new spirit of the Chinese army has led the local industrial and agricultural sectors to automatically organize army-civilian cooperation groups to replace the previously forced labor groups. The reporter personally saw thousands of laborers, mostly from the fields, engaged in digging trenches, destroying roads, and transporting military supplies on the battlefield. Each group is commanded by a foreman, and the work is entirely undertaken by the local area. The Chinese army in the war zone only needs to notify the county magistrate of the matters to be done, and the county magistrate will recruit workers from the cooperative group. The work will begin in a few hours. Labor wages are paid from military expenses and provincial government funds. However, there are also civilians living in the occupied areas who voluntarily serve, and they provide their own food and do not receive wages. This kind of spirit has never been seen before. Rural life here is no different from before the war. Japanese air raids have completely changed urban life. The population of Hengyang has decreased from 200,000 to 60,000. Their lives are completely militarized. Civilians are not allowed to wander the streets from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Local farmers and merchants can only bring limited necessities to the market for sale to avoid losses during air raids. Before the alert time, the streets are filled with civilians fleeing to nearby exits and empty pits to avoid air raids. The local government has ordered all production enterprises to withdraw from the city walls and provide funding to re-establish new factories in rural Guangxi and Hunan. The situation in Guilin is also the same. A mile away from the city, there is a refugee camp outside Qixing Mountain. The underground caves formed by glaciers hundreds of years ago are used by the people of Guilin as natural shelters from Japanese air raids. The government has built four large houses in the caves, each 40 square feet. There is a kindergarten at one entrance, and all the children in the city must attend school. In the past few months, there have been fifty air raids, and only 130 civilians have been killed or injured. The reporter has seen officials, civilians, and soldiers of all levels in Hunan united and cooperating as solid as iron. Although the Japanese army still intends to attack Hunan Province in the coming months, the reporter is convinced that the local Chinese army and civilians, united and cooperating as never before, will be able to protect this famous rice-producing area of northern Hunan.

<h3>Impressions of Foreign Reporters Inspecting the Traces of the Northern Hunan Battle</h3>
<p>Nanyue – Mr. Billard of the Havas News Agency, Mr. Martin of the United Press, Mr. Situ of the Associated Press, Mr. Turdin of the New York Times, and Mr. Yexiaming of TASS, led by Deputy Minister Dong XianGuang of the Central Propaganda Department, went to various places in northern Hunan to inspect and have now successfully completed their mission. They flew from Guilin to Chongqing on the 25th. When Deputy Minister Dong and others set off, the reporter accompanied them part of the way and successively met with Director Bai, Commander Chen, Commander Xue, and others, inquiring in detail about the Northern Hunan victory. They then went to Jinjing, Fulinpu, Qingshan City, and other places to pay respects to the traces of the battle and conduct on-the-spot investigations of the atrocities of the Japanese army, and the impressions they gained were extremely profound. The foreign reporters expressed their feelings about the trip to Commander Xue. First, they praised the perfection of the transportation facilities in various places along the way. The reporter said that the Japanese side had repeatedly declared that the Northern Hunan victory reported by the Chinese side was not the case. After our on-the-spot inspection, we can answer that this is indeed the case. They also said that at the front, they witnessed close cooperation between the various units and the news reporters, like family members, so that various news could be quickly transmitted, which is commendable. The rapid and accurate front-line news released by the Central News Agency on this Northern Hunan victory has had extremely great consequences. Regarding all the atrocities of the Japanese side, they said that according to the Chinese side's statements, they successively inquired with many people in Jinjing, Fulinpu, Qingshan City, and other places, and the contents were completely consistent, which is sufficient to prove that they are all facts. Then, they talked about general issues. They said that the current wounded soldier problem has been reasonably resolved due to the establishment of wounded soldier reception centers everywhere in the front. The spirit of army-civilian cooperation seen along the way is also worthy of admiration, and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the army and civilians is higher the closer they get to the front, which can be said to be a guarantee of final victory. Also, when the foreign reporters met with Commander Chen in a certain place yesterday, they also talked to him about their impressions of the trip. Mr. Durdin of the New York Times said that the Northern Hunan victory is indeed a fact and not false. The soldiers at the front are also extremely confident. Mr. Situ of the Associated Press said that the morale of the officers and soldiers at the front is increasing day by day, and the final victory is not a problem. He also said that just from traveling from Chongqing to northern Hunan, the vastness of the Chinese land and the richness of its specialties were the first things he felt. (Note: Situ had just arrived in China not long ago.) Mr. Billard of the Havas News Agency said that this inspection of northern Hunan made him deeply feel the greatness of the Chinese people's recovery power. For example, Changsha after the robbery, when we first arrived, there were only 50,000 people, and when we came back, it had increased to 70,000. Also, like the houses destroyed by the Japanese army everywhere along the way, they were rebuilt in a few days. The greatness of this recovery power is extremely admirable. Commander Chen immediately replied that China is an agricultural country and the people's lives are simple, so it is easy to recover after destruction. Mr. Bi continued, "I still remember that the various places in France during the European War were also destroyed, but it took a long time after the war to recover. France is also an agricultural country, but its recovery power is far worse than China." Chen replied again, "The lives of the French people are more complicated, so the recovery is slower." Mr. Martin of the United Press said that he deeply believed in the Japanese army's atrocities in northern Hunan this time, because when he returned to Changsha, he received a definitive report, the contents of which he briefly mentioned to Commander Chen. It can be seen that this inspection by the foreign reporters has confirmed the victory won by the Chinese army in northern Hunan and the various atrocities of the Japanese army, and has also confirmed that the Japanese army's combat power and morale have greatly declined. The final victory is also very obvious. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>The National Diplomacy Association Sends a Telegram to Grew</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The National Diplomacy Association sent a telegram to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew today, stating, "Your Excellency's speech in Tokyo not only fully demonstrated the U.S.'s consistent peace policy and reiterated the principle of the Open Door, but also has the effect of prompting the Japanese people who are kept in the dark to wake up suddenly." At the same time, the association also sent a telegram to U.S. Secretary of State Hull, stating, "The Chinese people unanimously praised Ambassador Grew's speech, believing that the U.S. government's wise decision on the Far East and the spiritual assistance to the Chinese people are immeasurable."

<h3>Foreign War Correspondents Return to Chongqing from Hunan</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A group of foreign reporters who went to inspect the front lines in northern Hunan flew back here yesterday afternoon with "spoils of war." During their trip, the Chinese army presented them with command knives, flags, pistols, and other souvenirs abandoned by the retreating Japanese army. This trip did not actually reach the front lines, because after a few of them arrived at the Miluo River, they decided to return to Chongqing. When asked about the accuracy of the Chinese army's victory in Changsha, a reporter smiled and said, "Of course there are no Japanese troops there." The reporters all said that the Japanese army left behind a large amount of military supplies and military equipment, which shows that the Japanese army's retreat must have been very hasty. The reporters saw signs of fierce fighting in Yingtan. Other Japanese troops on the southeast bank of Dongting Lake landed there in an attempt to encircle the Chinese army defending Xinqiang River and the Miluo River. The reporter also said that the terrain in northern Hunan made it very difficult for invading troops, because the roads had been destroyed and the mountainous countryside was most suitable for ambush warfare. They were entertained by General Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army in Changsha, General Chen Cheng, and General Bai Chongxi. (Dispatch of the 26th by Reuters)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Examining Soviet Policy Through Recent Events</h3>
<p>Today, let us focus our discussion on the Soviet Union, haphazardly presenting our recent observations.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union, there is a small matter, like a bone in my throat, which I must quickly spit out. I often see newspapers run by the Japanese claiming that the *Shen Bao* is an "anti-Japanese organization" and a "reddened newspaper," and therefore advocating for its suppression and prohibition. Taking advantage of this discussion of the Soviet Union, please allow me to say a word first. The label of "reddened," in the eyes of those advocating suppression and prohibition, is naturally seen as a crime. We, however, believe that whether being considered "reddened" is praise or disparagement, honor or disgrace, it is inappropriate to apply it to the *Shen Bao*. To elaborate: If the Moscow of the past twenty years listed the *Shen Bao* among the ranks of "red" newspapers, we would not consider it praise or honor, but a mistaken compliment. If the German-Italian-Japanese bloc of two months ago placed the *Shen Bao* among the ranks of "reddened" newspapers, we would not consider it disparagement or disgrace, but a gross slander. Why? Because either praise or slander does not align with the facts. As for being "anti-Japanese," although it is not within the scope of this article's discussion, it does not hurt to say a word in connection: Disliking Japan may stem from traditional consciousness, narrow-minded emotions, or some kind of strategic need. Such categories may exist, but are certainly not the majority. The *Shen Bao* deeply believes that the vast majority of its readers, regardless of whether they are in or out of office, dislike Japan and thus become anti-Japanese because Japan has engaged in acts of aggression against China. If Japan one day proves through its actions that it has abandoned aggression, then the *Shen Bao* will certainly advocate not dwelling on past grievances and seek amity with Japan. If Japan continues its aggression, then we deeply believe that even those who admire Japan and hope for amity will eventually be unable to help! In short, in this unprecedented extraordinary period, we feel no interest whatsoever in debating ideologies or differences between factions. All alliances, enmities, grievances, and choices are measured solely by the interests and survival of the Chinese nation. We will use this standard in discussing the Soviet Union as well.</p>
<p>In previous discussions of the Soviet Union, we often said it was the most difficult mystery in the world to decipher. Therefore, what intentions it ultimately holds and what actions it will ultimately take cannot be foreseen or predicted until its intentions and actions are revealed to the world. From the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact to the present day, exactly two months have passed. The impressions the Soviet Union has given people in these two months are: abruptness, contradiction, fickleness, and coldness. The reactions it has elicited from people include those who swallow their anger, those who are pleasantly surprised, and those who don't know whether to laugh or cry. All of these past actions, except for the situation with Turkey, which outsiders have not been able to fully understand, are obvious in people's minds and do not need to be listed and elaborated upon. Those surrounding the Soviet Union are assessing its future actions, each according to its possible impact, and expressing their attitudes of prayer, cursing, enticement, and fear. Does the Soviet Union possess overwhelming power, which other countries find impossible to resist? Chamberlain and Hitler provided the opportunity, and Stalin and his successors were able to use it skillfully. Even now, we cannot definitively say what the Soviet Union's future actions will be. However, general observations suggest that while past Soviet actions were insufficient for understanding its entire intentions and actions, we can now gain insight into them through the outcome of the Soviet Union's negotiations with Finland. Indeed, the two main doubts that the Soviet Union is most widely viewed with are: First, will the Soviet Union ultimately conspire with Germany? Second, will the Soviet Union recklessly seek expansion without resorting to force? Its actions towards Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania involved expansion without the use of force. However, these situations involved a vast disparity in power, eliminating the need for force, and are insufficient to prove that it would not resort to force. Its actions towards Poland involved expansion with the use of force. However, this was due to seizing an opportunity conveniently, without requiring much effort, and is also insufficient to prove that it would not resort to force. Finland is not like the Baltic states. Internally, its national strength, and externally, its international position, are sufficient to warrant a war. If the Soviet Union recklessly seeks expansion, it will inevitably have to use force against Finland. Therefore, the outcome of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations should provide the world with a clear answer to the second doubt. We cannot definitively say what the answer will be. However, extrapolating from the various impressions the Soviet Union has recently given us: such as the reply to the US President's telegram, which, although irrelevant, was tolerant; such as the negotiations with Turkey, which, although not satisfactory, resulted in mutual expressions of harmony; such as the rumors in the Far East of Soviet aggression against China, which, although could have been ignored, were actively and earnestly denied; such as the Soviet ambassador to England immediately deciding to begin formal negotiations today after consulting with the British Foreign Secretary on trade issues between the two countries. All of these unconnected fragments can largely dispel all doubts.</p>
<p>We have always said that Soviet affairs are most difficult to decipher. However, while seeking answers to doubts, we still want to attempt further speculation. In the near future, the Soviet Union is unlikely to prioritize international "reddening." Looking at what it prioritizes, it prioritizes two points: first, it views Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as satellites. Given Finland's undeniable national strength, it uses the demand that Finland not join an anti-Soviet group as a political condition; and the acquisition of several small Finnish islands close to Soviet ports, and the demilitarization of Finland on the Åland Islands, as its military conditions. What it took from Poland, internally, was to strengthen its political base through general elections; externally, it was to show goodwill to Britain, earning repeated statements from the British authorities that they "are not fighting for a particular country's borders." The "particular country" is of course Poland; the statement "not fighting for borders" probably means fighting for Poland's restoration, but not insisting on its original borders. There is no reason not to see this as an open tacit agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. The right and wrong of Soviet expansion are open to debate, but the outline of its expansion in Europe has become largely discernible today. Striving to stabilize and enrich this outline is what it prioritizes. Second, the Soviet Union's commercial negotiations with Germany and Britain are proceeding simultaneously. We cannot hastily infer from the hostility between Britain and Germany that the Soviet Union's simultaneous negotiations with both sides are a manipulative tactic, sincere towards Germany but insincere towards Britain, or vice versa. The world generally appreciates that beyond the commercial negotiations, there is a symbolic political intention. In our view, it is better to think that the Soviet Union does not attach great importance to or is not constrained by the war between Britain and Germany. Therefore, it will not accept Germany's appeals and refuse trade with Britain, nor will it accept Britain's conditions and stop supplying Germany. In short, as far as trade is concerned, the Soviet Union only uses its own economic supply and needs as the criterion; the success or failure of negotiations only depends on whether a purely commercial calculation is beneficial to it; other than that, the Soviet Union hardly considers anything else. The Soviet Union is certainly not a capitalist country, but looking at its intentions, it seizes every opportunity and every possibility to leverage the resources of Britain, Germany, and any other country to seek its own becoming a strong and rapidly advancing capital unit. Is this not the Soviet Union's policy today? If our analysis is not mistaken, then its attitude in the Far East can also be seen from this. And the rumors of advancing troops into Xinjiang, or making political demands on China, which would lead to broad and serious international disputes, are certainly things the Soviet Union will not do. This can be stated definitively.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Reports on Military Situation in the House of Commons, Refutes Ribbentrop's Speech</h3>
<p>London - When the House of Commons convened this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately delivered a speech reporting on the military situation of the past week. He stated, in brief: "There have been no major battles on the Western Front. Our country continues to supply fresh troops and military supplies to the expeditionary forces currently at the French front. Regarding the naval aspect, none of our ships escorted by warships have been destroyed by the enemy, and our warships and aircraft have not suffered damage. German aircraft often attack our Scapa Flow naval base in Scotland and the Firth of Forth, and three have been shot down by our forces. In addition, our cargo ships have had five ships sunk by the enemy, totaling 22,715 tons. The work of searching for submarines has also been intensified. The number of enemy submarines destroyed by our forces is still considerable, enough to make us believe that the threat posed by enemy submarines can be easily eliminated. The point that enemy submarines should draw attention to is that their lawless behavior has already intensified. As for the international situation, the major event of the past week was the successful signing of the Mutual Assistance Pact between Britain, France, and Turkey. This pact is not only extremely satisfying to the British Empire and France, but it is also welcomed by countries around the world. This is something that we should recognize as a major encouragement. The reason why countries around the world have expressed their welcome is because the pact is, at the very least, a guarantee of peace in the Eastern Mediterranean. There is no doubt about that. This pact does not pose a threat to any country; it is purely a defensive tool, with its sole objective being to resist aggression. The governments of Britain, France, and Turkey will also hold talks to discuss the issue of British and French economic and financial assistance to Turkey, as well as military supply assistance. These talks are being conducted in a friendly and candid spirit, and a general agreement has been reached. We firmly believe that beneficial results have been obtained in practice. The German authorities recently convened a meeting of leaders of the National Socialist Party's local branches in Berlin. The speech that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop subsequently delivered in Danzig was likely the result of this meeting. However, judging by his speech, there are countless instances of distorted right and wrong. Although Ribbentrop wants to deceive fair-minded observers around the world, it is difficult for him to succeed because the counter-evidence is readily available. His main argument is nothing more than that it is Britain, not Germany, that has brewed and instigated the war. This statement is inconsistent with the facts and needs no further explanation. The whole world already knows it. The problem that historians should consider in the future is to what extent the tragedy that has recently occurred in Europe is due to Ribbentrop's ignorance of British policy and the British national character. Ribbentrop seems to want to invite the Soviet Union to join an anti-British crusade. We should now recall the speech he gave when he first took office as ambassador to Britain in 1936 to prove his self-contradiction. At that time, he declared: 'Our leader Hitler firmly believes that whether from the perspective of Europe or the British Empire, the only real crisis is the spread of communism. This is the most terrible crisis (the members of parliament laughed loudly), the reason why it is most terrible is simply because people always recognize it too late.' (The members of parliament laughed even louder. At that time, Soviet Ambassador Maisky was in the diplomatic corps' spectator seat and laughed loudly when he heard this.) Ribbentrop declared in Danzig yesterday that Germany wants to end this war with all its might. If Germany's decision is indeed so, then our only response is that we are also determined to fight to the end. However, one point must be stated: this war was not caused by Britain provoking Germany, but because the German government, regardless of the repeated warnings issued by our country, continued to engage in acts of aggression, finally forcing our country to respond. In other words, the responsibility for this war and all its consequences should be borne by Germany. This matter is, in fact, caused by Germany's disregard for promises and violation of the rights and freedoms of nations." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Eden Speaks on War Aims, Establishes International Trust, Dominion Cabinet Members to Arrive in England to Discuss Close Cooperation Methods</h3>
<p>London - Dominion Secretary Eden delivered a broadcast speech this evening, stating, in brief: "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have all sent cabinet members who will gather in London in the coming weeks. The close cooperation between the Dominions and the Mother Country will be evident here again. We do not intend to hold any kind of formal meeting at that time, nor do we need to draft cumbersome agendas. Instead, we will exchange views in an informal manner and discuss methods of close cooperation. As for the current situation, the Dominions have already made great contributions to air force cooperation. This has a huge impact on the future of the war, and there is no need to elaborate. The Dominions are training air force personnel very quickly, and the results are excellent. These personnel receive preliminary training within the Dominions and then gather in Canada for further study. The training methods are very innovative. Our country's skilled pilots will therefore receive sufficient replenishment. As for this war, it was caused by the German government's betrayal of trust and Hitler's insistence on going his own way. We have been forced into this situation and have no choice but to deal with it. However, we are not fighting against one person or for a country's borders, but for the maintenance of trust between nations. If there is no trust between nations, there can be no peace. In short, all kinds of documents about the war have been made public, and the world will make its own judgments about right and wrong. After Britain and France win the war, the responsibilities they bear will be very heavy, but the opportunities will also be limitless. The men and women of all countries, although subjected to servitude, have not had their spirits exhausted. At that time, they will certainly be effectively leveraged to promote cooperation between European countries and establish understanding among countries around the world." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Scathingly Criticize German Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>London - The *Times* today's editorial scathingly refutes German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's broadcast speech in Danzig on October 24, stating that Ribbentrop, since taking the position as ambassador to England, has already been deemed unqualified, and later made one mistake after another, causing Germany to be in the worst diplomatic position ever. This time his high-sounding words, the main theme is nervous depression, and the nervous depression is not good based on his "nervous warfare." Ribbentrop has consistently insisted to the Fuhrer that Britain will never take up arms to resist Germany, now he loudly exclaims, "The British government has been systematically preparing for war against Germany for many years." The *Times* enumerates the impact of Ribbentrop's policies in Japan, Spain, Italy, the Baltic, Central Europe, and Southeast Europe, saying that if this kind of person were not unfortunately still occupying an important international position, then what he said would be regarded as coming from a thief and not worth paying attention to. Only that his lies and distortions can be viewed as another clear demonstration of Ribbentrop's decline in European diplomacy, The *Times* in accordance with recently published documents, refuting Ribbentrop's remarks, said that there is no doubt that Ribbentrop would not even consider most of the public opinions in his own country, to make the sad remarks of encouraging his countrymen to resist Britain, it is directly admitting his own mistakes in predicting and declaring the bankruptcy of his own policies. The *Manchester Guardian* also published an editorial, stating that the French side can respond to the part of Ribbentrop's speech about France, but we must explain that France and Poland established a mutual assistance pact long before the current British government came to power, and this pact was subsequently continued twice by the French and Polish governments.

<h3>Germany Actively Attacks Warships and Merchant Ships, British Navy Also Intensifies Blockade of Germany, Intercepts 338,000 Tons of Contraband, Soviet Union Protests British-Announced List of Contraband</h3>
<p>London - According to reliable sources from authoritative sources today, since the outbreak of the war, the British government has detained 580 ships of various countries, including 24 American merchant ships, which have been detained for inspection for as long as 18 days. According to Minister of Economic Warfare Cross, in the House of Commons, in the first six weeks after the outbreak of the war, Britain intercepted 338,000 tons of contraband goods bound for Germany. In general, Germany's overseas supply has been completely cut off. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Minister of Economic Warfare Cross stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government authorities have exchanged views with the governments of various neutral countries on the issue of inspecting wartime contraband. The governments of Iceland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium have now sent delegations to arrive here. We are also contacting the governments of other neutral countries through diplomatic channels, and good progress has been made. In short, Britain must carefully inspect the goods of various neutral countries, and the legitimate trade and needs of each country will certainly be taken into account. However, the rights of belligerent countries must also be fully exercised, and various contraband goods, all those suspected of assisting the enemy, will be detained. As for the general situation, the source of Germany's overseas supply has almost been cut off. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Belgium - The British Embassy in Belgium recently issued a press release stating that our country's economic blockade against Germany is necessary in the current war. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the ships of various neutral countries, and various procedures must be simplified. However, because past inspections have not been thorough, some goods still arrived in Germany. In the future, it will be necessary to handle them strictly. In short, our country has no intention of hindering the supply of various neutral countries. If these countries can cooperate fully, then inspection procedures will be able to be completed quickly. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The British government previously sent two notes to the Soviet government on September 6 and 11, 1939, notifying the types of wartime contraband. Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin recently sent a reply to British Ambassador Seeds, stating, "I acknowledge receipt of your government's two notes of September 6 and 11, 1939, and I am deeply aware of your intentions. The Foreign Affairs Committee, on behalf of the Soviet government, hereby responds as follows: The list of contraband announced in the British government's note of September 6 conflicts greatly with international law and the principles expressed in the international declaration on naval warfare of February 26, 1909, seriously damages the interests of neutral countries, and destroys international trade. The British government has included fuel, paper, cotton, livestock fodder, shoes, socks, clothing, and clothing materials, and even all food, such as bread, meat, butter, sugar, etc., in the list of contraband, which in fact amounts to declaring that all basic necessities of life are contraband, thereby creating the possibility of unlimited or arbitrary designation of any civilian goods as contraband. From now on, the supply of necessities for the life of the peaceful population will be thoroughly disrupted, so that the health and lives of the peaceful population will be seriously endangered, causing a great disaster among the vast population. According to the world's recognized principles of international law, the act of bombing peaceful people, women, children, the old and the weak by air should be prohibited. For the same reason, the Soviet government believes that depriving peaceful people of food, clothing, and fuel, and declaring such necessities as contraband, thereby causing women, children, the old and the weak to suffer pain, hunger, and cold, is also inappropriate. Therefore, the Soviet government hereby declares that it cannot agree with and consider effective the British government's note of September 6. The Soviet government also cannot agree with the points contained in the British government's note of September 11, namely, that the British government has unilaterally established a method of monitoring neutral merchant ships in several designated seaports. The Soviet government believes that requiring neutral merchant ships to go to the aforementioned ports, and attaching the threat of enforcement by force, is completely arbitrary and unreasonable. This method violates the basic principles of freedom of maritime trade and is also inconsistent with the International Declaration of February 26, 1909, and the ruling of the Hague Tribunal regarding the 'Carthage' incident in 1913. At the same time, the Soviet government declares that its own merchant ships are all inherent property, and even from this point of view, they should not be subjected to the same compulsory treatment as privately owned merchant ships. Based on the above reasons, the Soviet government reserves the right to demand compensation from the British government for all losses suffered by its agencies and citizens due to the aforementioned measures of the British government and the actions of the British authorities." (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Denmark - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a press release stating that it received a letter from the German Embassy stating that the country's navy will launch a relentless attack on the warships of Britain and France, as well as the merchant ships they escort. This action is not limited to warships, but also applies to escorted merchant ships, regardless of which country they belong to. Merchant ships of all countries that sail at night, if they do not comply with international navigation regulations and light a light, may be mistaken for enemy ships and risk being sunk.

<h3>Western Front Battle Report</h3>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters recently issued the 104th battle report, stating, "Heavy rain last night, the front line was peaceful." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters recently issued the 103rd battle report, stating, "Both enemy and our reconnaissance units were quite active in various places on the front line today. An enemy troop came to attack along the Moselle River and has been repelled." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London - French military commentators declared that the recent activities on the Western Front show that the German army is eager to retake the important high ground southwest of the Hautes-Hautes Forest, which is still in the hands of the French army. Since Sunday, the German army has attacked three times, but all have been repelled. French commentators all believe that the extended artillery bombardment that was commonly seen in the last war will be abandoned and replaced by concentrated fire. This artillery fire will be used to dazzle the defending troops, and then followed by attacks by various forces, with special efforts devoted to disrupting the rear of the defending troops in order to prevent their supply and reinforcements. This strategy was quite effective in Poland, but the situation at that time was very different from the Western Front. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command issued a battle report this afternoon stating that the high ground 12 kilometers west of Völklingen, located near the German-French border, was occupied by the German army the day before yesterday. The French army launched a counterattack yesterday, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce, but there were no results. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Protest Reason: England Claims No Basis</h3>
<p>London - Reuters reported today from responsible sources that the Soviet Union has protested against the British contraband list, but the grounds for its protest are completely unfounded. The 1909 international conference cited in the protest, which drafted the so-called London Declaration on Naval Warfare, was a fruitless meeting, and its declaration was never ratified by any country. It did not come into effect in the first week of the European War in 1914. According to today's international law, any belligerent government can freely declare any item as contraband. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the British inspection of neutral ships, after the Soviet government lodged a protest with British Ambassador Sir Seeds yesterday, local officials have expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the British government's contraband list announced in a note earlier this year is identical to the blockade implemented by the Allied Powers, including Russia, during the last European War. It is difficult to understand why the Soviet Union is now opposing it. (Havas telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - Although British authorities have assured the facilitation of ships carrying food for neutral countries, Dutch shipping companies still express dissatisfaction. Several Dutch ships were detained by British warships at Downs for as long as six weeks, and there are still as many as thirty Dutch ships waiting for inspection there. Dutch shipping companies are quite critical, and mentioned that the British personnel implementing contraband inspections are all military personnel, who have no knowledge of international shipping regulations. A Dutch delegation is currently in London discussing with British authorities, and a better solution can be obtained. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Investigation of Detained American Ship's Cargo; Sailors Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>Moscow - According to Moermansk sources, after the local maritime authorities determined that the cargo ship "City of Flint" entered the port for repairs, the detention of the German crew members has been lifted. The ship remains in port for a thorough investigation of the nature of the cargo. (TASS telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - The State Department has just received a telegram from Ambassador Steinhardt in the Soviet Union stating that he received a note from the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, stating that the American cargo ship "City of Flint" is currently in Moermansk, and all crew members are safe and sound on board. (Havas telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the detention of the American cargo ship "City of Flint," Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the press stating that according to a report from the American Embassy in Germany, German naval authorities and the Hamburg Prize Court have denied the news reports. The British Embassy is continuing its investigation. In addition, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin told American Ambassador Steinhardt yesterday that he was unaware of the matter and would inquire with the naval authorities. Furthermore, according to a telegram from the American Legation in Norway, the "City of Flint" carried a total of ninety people, of whom seventeen were sailors sent by a German warship, and thirty-seven were survivors of the British ship "Stonegate," who have landed in Trondheim, Norway. In short, the United States government is determined to thoroughly investigate this matter in accordance with international law and American rights. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Someone Plots to Sabotage Two Major British and French Liners</h3>
<p>New York - The New York World Telegram recently reported that a suspicious person was arrested by the police in a subway station near the anchorages of the French liner "Normandie" and the British liner "Queen Mary." Explosives were found on his person. The person refused to state his nationality or reveal the reason for carrying the explosives. It is suspected that he intended to sabotage the British and French liners. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Officials recently announced that five British ships, totaling 22,700 tons, have been sunk by German submarines. Thirty-one crew members of the "Ledbury" have been rescued. The crew of the "Stonegate" have all been rescued. Thirty-one of the thirty-five crew members of the "Leifur" have reportedly been rescued, but their whereabouts are unknown. Only five crew members of the "Manningtree" have been rescued. Seventy-eight crew members of the "Cronsham" have been rescued, but the whereabouts of twenty others are unknown. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Amendment to Limit Presidential Power Vetoed by US Senate; US Government Announces Figures for Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>Washington - The Senate today continued to discuss the Neutrality Act proposed by Pittman. Republican Senator Johnson proposed an amendment stating that once the President or Congress recognizes that a state of war has occurred, the President should declare that a state of war exists. The purpose of this proposal was obviously to limit the President's power. Democratic Senator Pittman, Connelly, and Republican Senators Vandenberg and Norris spoke in opposition. The Senate ultimately rejected it by a vote of 61 to 26. Johnson then proposed another amendment, arguing that neither Congress nor the President has the power to recognize that a state of war exists, which was also rejected by a vote of 75 to 14. Progressive Senator La Follette proposed an amendment calling for the establishment of an export control committee to limit the quantity of various American goods shipped to belligerent countries, so that it would not exceed peacetime levels, which was also denied by a vote of 66 to 21. The meeting was then adjourned. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - During yesterday's Senate debate on amendments to the Neutrality Act, isolationist Senator La Follette proposed holding a referendum before declaring war. La Follette also said, "If the members of the House and Senate truly represent the will of their districts, they will consider this matter." The administration strongly opposes this. Secretary of State Hull and other administrative leaders stated that this move would weaken the nation's foreign policy and would not be helpful in avoiding war. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to the State Department, since the invocation of the Neutrality Act on September 5, over US$75 million worth of licenses for arms exports to belligerent countries have been rejected. Of these, those procured for France were worth US$57.5 million, Britain US$15 million, Australia US$5 million, and Germany only US$50,000. The British dominions and colonies affected include Canada, South Africa, Burma, India, Southern Rhodesia, the Federated Malay States, Hong Kong, Palestine, New Zealand, and Kenya.

<h3>Sinking of HMS Royal Oak Continues to be Discussed in British House of Commons</h3>
<p>London - During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, a member asked whether the government would issue another statement regarding the sinking of the battleship "Royal Oak" at a later date. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill immediately replied, "Yes, but we must strive to be cautious so as not to reveal information that would benefit the enemy." A member also asked whether it was credible that the commander of the German submarine that sank the "Royal Oak" claimed that the submarine had been observing the vicinity for forty-eight hours before entering Scapa Flow. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill replied, "I have read the statement made by the submarine commander. Part of it is what I announced in the House of Commons, and another part is completely inconsistent with the facts. In short, Scapa Flow is surrounded by islands and covers dozens of miles, and the warships anchored there are several miles apart." First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill also replied to a member's inquiry, stating that there are 5,000 naval trainees under the age of eighteen serving on various ships, of whom 137 have been killed in action. At this point, Labour MP Wedgwood asked whether battleships of the same class as the "Royal Oak" would be modernized to make them less vulnerable to torpedo attacks, and how much this project would cost. He also asked whether orders had been given to stop building aircraft carriers and giant battleships under construction in our country, which Germany does not have, in order to focus on building more needed warships. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill replied in writing that battleships of the same class as the "Royal Oak" have all been modernized, at an average cost of £200,000 per ship. As for aircraft carriers and battleships, not only Germany but other naval powers are also building them. This is especially necessary for our country to control maritime communication lines. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin - This afternoon, the German Naval Headquarters announced that at noon on the 21st of this month, a German patrol boat accidentally struck a mine and sank near the Danish island of Møn. Five of the fifty-five crew members were rescued. (Haitong, 26th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Finnish Negotiations: Contents Kept Strictly Secret; Rumors of Four Soviet Demands; Finnish Representatives Return to their Country for Instructions</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, diplomatic sources here recently stated that the strict secrecy surrounding diplomatic negotiations has rarely been seen as much as in the current Soviet-Finnish negotiations. In Finland, only a few key cabinet members are aware of the contents. However, considering the various sources of information, there are still various reasons to be optimistic about the prospects of the negotiations and that they will not lead to war. This is because Finland has the sympathy of the United States and the Scandinavian countries, and its national character is extremely strong, and its military strength cannot be underestimated. The Soviet Union may not dare to risk attacking it. As for the demands made by the Soviet Union, it is rumored that the following items are included:</p>
<p>*   The small islands in the Gulf of Finland, near the Soviet ports of Leningrad and Kronstadt, which have always belonged to Finland, should be ceded to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>*   A strip of land bordering the Soviet Union in the Finnish Karelian region should be ceded to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>*   Regarding the Åland Islands, Finland should provide guarantees that it will not build defensive fortifications on the islands.</p>
<p>*   Finland should provide guarantees that it will not participate in political groups opposed to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If the above points can be complied with, the Soviet Union can cede certain territorial interests in the Arctic coast peninsula and the Polozhavia region (where the Finnish population is a large majority) to Finland as compensation. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - A rumor that the Finnish government intends to borrow money from the United States has recently been denied by a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - The delegation led by Paasikivi returned here from Moscow this morning. Once new instructions are received, it is said that they will return to Moscow to continue the talks. (Havas telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - Finnish Chief Delegate Paasikivi and Finance Minister Tanner returned here this morning. After disembarking, they immediately went to meet with Prime Minister Cajander and Foreign Minister Erkko to hold talks. The general view is that the issues between the Soviet Union and Finland can still be resolved through negotiations. Although there has been no development regarding Finland issuing bonds in the United States at this time, financial figures claim that now is an excellent time for Finland to issue bonds in the United States, given President Roosevelt and the American people's sympathy for Finland, and it may be slightly successful. (Haitong telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Well-informed sources here believe that Finnish Envoy Paasikivi, who is in charge of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, will return to Moscow in about a week to continue negotiations with the Soviet government. The Finnish government believes that the new Soviet proposals are of a decisive nature, and Finland needs at least five days to consider them. (Haitong telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko gave a statement to the press as the Finnish delegation left the Soviet Union to return home, elaborating on the government's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. It stated that the Finnish government does not intend to change its policy of strict neutrality on national affairs, nor does it intend to make concessions on vital interests in order to resolve the current crisis. It only hopes to resolve all issues through peaceful means, based on the principle of strict neutrality. (Haitong telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Conducts Business Negotiations; Maisky Visits Halifax</h3>
<p>London - Soviet Ambassador to England Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to discuss trade issues between the two countries. According to responsible sources, British-Soviet trade negotiations will be conducted by representatives of the Ministry of Commerce, Ambassador Maisky, and representatives of the Soviet Trade Delegation in England, starting tomorrow. The Ministry of Commerce will also hold a meeting tomorrow morning to determine the principles of the negotiations. Political figures say that this negotiation was considered as early as the middle of last month, and its significance is extremely important and contains political implications. The extent to which the Soviet Union can maintain an independent position from Germany economically can be seen from this. In addition, economic negotiations are also underway between Germany and the Soviet Union. What England and Germany need is clearly in opposition, and the Soviet Union's choice will be a symbol of its political intentions. (Havas telegram, 25th)</p>

The Soviet trade delegation came to Germany to investigate the production situation of German industry and chemical industry. (Haitong telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Strategic Naval Position of Ports in Estonia and Latvia</h3>
<p>Riga, Latvia - Naval expert Captain Leiner-Kranf of the Baltic Sea, when interviewed by Mr. Hohenberg, special envoy of Haitong News Agency, reviewed the strategic importance of the bases in the Baltic Sea that the Soviet Union had obtained after signing treaties with Estonia and Latvia. Captain Leiner-Kranf has held important naval positions and is friendly with the Russian Emperor and naval officers of the Imperial Russian era, so his remarks are valued by all parties. The reporter raised various questions, and Mr. Leiner-Kranf answered them in detail.</p>
<p>*   The situation of Russian defenses along the Baltic Sea coast during the last World War: Captain Leiner-Kranf said that when the last World War broke out, the defense locations were only Kronstadt, Sveaborg, Dünamünde, and Libau.</p>
<p>*   The problem of defending the Gulf of Finland: Captain Leiner-Kranf said that the defense of the Gulf was divided into three lines of defense. At that time, Mr. Leiner-Kranf was the commander of the second line of defense.</p>
<p>*   The problem of fortifying the Åland Islands: Mr. Leiner-Kranf said that the Russian Emperor at that time firmly believed that the situation of the Åland Islands would have to change sooner or later.

About 450 Germans will take the ship to Danzig. However, the German resettlement plan has not actually started yet, because about 60,000 Germans here must sign a German-Latvian agreement before they can leave the country.

<h3>Four Near Eastern Countries Exchange Views</h3>
<p>Paris - Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, which concluded a non-aggression pact in 1937, are now said to be holding a meeting in Baghdad or Ankara soon. Informed circles here have paid close attention to it. These four countries have now begun to exchange views. It is speculated that this meeting is related to the establishment of a mutual assistance treaty between England, France, and Turkey. It is likely that these four countries will also review the impact of Soviet-Turkish negotiations on the situation in the Middle East at the meeting. Since this non-aggression pact of the four countries contains a very accurate definition of aggression, this pact can become the basis for a four-country group similar to the Balkan Group. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Soviet Ships Mutually Detained are Exchanged and Returned</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese and Soviet authorities are conducting various negotiations to resolve various pending issues. As a result of several agreements on the issue of ships previously detained by the two countries, it was decided to exchange and return them to each other in succession. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an outline on the 22nd as follows: Regarding the detention of Japanese ships by the Soviet Union, since the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have negotiated several times, the crew of the Tsuruga Maru and four fishing boats, 48 people, were released on March 2 this year, and the crew of the Asahou Maru, Kyouei Maru, and Take Maru were also handed over on September 20. Regarding the issue of the ships themselves, a general solution was reached by September, and the Soviet side began to return the Japanese Chokichi Maru, Kyoei Maru (October 20), Fukui Maru (30), Tsuruga Maru, Hisanaga Maru, and Asahi Maru from September 20. As for other ships, they will be handed over after repairs. Furthermore, the issue of the release of the Hakuyo Maru is currently under negotiation. It is expected that part of the stranded ship will be handed over soon, and the remaining part is also scheduled to be handed over to the other party soon. (Domei News Agency telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Board of Trade Prohibits Import of Silver</h3>
<p>London - The Board of Trade today ordered a ban on the import of silver bullion and foreign silver coins into the UK, except for those with licenses. (Reuters telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Trade announced yesterday that the order banning the import of silver was issued to protect the British pound, but countries such as Japan will be greatly affected. In the eight months of 1939, Japan was the country with the most imports. American bankers will also be affected. They have been taking advantage of the drastic changes in the London exchange rate to ship silver to England and profit from it. The market here is not surprised by this order, but whether the silver market will become sluggish as a result will depend on whether parties can obtain special permits. Currently, the impact is that prices will increase due to increased demand. (Associated Press telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Attitude Towards China Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the Japanese rumor that British Foreign Secretary Halifax had told Chinese Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi at the outbreak of the European War that Britain could no longer assist President Chiang Kai-shek, according to reliable sources here, this statement is inaccurate. In fact, the British attitude towards China has not changed. (Reuters telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Responds to Questions in the House of Commons: Withdrawal of Gunboats from Yangtze River Actually Serves Another Purpose</h3>
<p>London - During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Adams asked First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill whether the withdrawal of five British gunboats stationed in China from the Yangtze River was due to Japan's claim that Western countries should withdraw from the Far East, or whether there was another reason. What would be the use of these gunboats afterwards? Churchill immediately gave a written reply, stating that the reason for the withdrawal of the gunboats from the Yangtze River was that they were more useful in other parts of China. How they would be deployed afterwards could not be disclosed in order to avoid compromising public interests. Conservative MP Morgan then asked whether the British government had made suggestions to Japan for mutual concessions in order to promote friendship. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that although the British government had not made specific suggestions to Japan on this point, it had always wished to promote friendship with that country.

<h3>Military Commission Releases Weekly War Situation: October 18th to 24th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated that since this week (October 18th to 24th), there have been no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts. The Japanese army has been repeatedly defeated on various fronts and is gradually approaching a state of exhaustion. Although they continue to struggle to reverse the decline, they have not succeeded under the strong attacks of the Chinese forces. The more important aspects of the combat are described as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: The Chinese army in the West River area has been fiercely attacking Jiangmen, Xinhui, and Sanshui since last week. The Japanese forces stubbornly resisted, and the fighting was extremely fierce. On the 16th, they broke into Jiangmen. The puppet army led by He Ping took the opportunity to revolt. On the 17th, they continued to capture Duchuan, eliminating the obstacle to the transportation of the three rivers. On the 18th, they broke into Jiangmen again, and on the 19th, they broke into Xinhui, burning down the Japanese military headquarters, barracks, warehouses, and other facilities. The Chinese army advancing towards Sanshui has crossed the Greater and Lesser Meishan Mountains and Longshe School and is advancing with combined forces. Another unit, with the cooperation of infantry and artillery, recovered Da Chigang and pursued to the city walls. The Japanese were extremely panicked. The Chinese army on the periphery of Guangzhou, with swift action, first destroyed the key Japanese transportation points, the Jiangcun Railway Bridge and the He Bridge in Huaxian County, and then launched a fierce attack on various fronts. They repeatedly captured Xiling in the county, Shitan, Baimawei, and Longyanliao near Shilong, and various strongholds in Wanqingsha, Xianwan County. They broke into Jiangyu, Guotang, and Zhizhushan on the Yuehan Road, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. As for the southern route, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Qixianshan and the east of Qixian in multiple routes for several days, repeatedly capturing Wenling City and Dalu City, two strongholds, and once broke into Qixian County, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese in Chaoshan, due to their weak forces, were frequently intercepted. They deployed over a thousand soldiers as reinforcements. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation and launched attacks for several days. One route is now approaching Chaozhou City, and the other route is surrounding Chenghai, currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi Fronts: On the border of Hubei and Jiangxi, Chinese and Japanese forces have continued to engage in battles for days. The Japanese forces besieged in Tongcheng, Hubei, are still tightly surrounded by the Chinese forces. The two strongholds of Xishan in the southeast of the city and Dasha Ping in the north of the city have been successively captured by the Chinese army, and the Japanese forces in the city are already showing signs of wavering. At the same time, the Chinese army in Tongshan thoroughly eliminated the Japanese forces in Baoshi River and Hengshi Tan, and these areas were also reported to have been recovered. Another unit of the Chinese army, in continuous attacks, quickly captured Yanglinshan and Chanbotan, two key outer positions of Bailuoji, and once stormed into the Japanese阵, killing countless enemies. The Chinese army on the north bank of the Xinqiang River in northern Hunan continued to attack for several days. One route captured Taolin and pressed the attack on Linxiang. The other route captured Zhongfang, Xitang, and Yanjia Dashan, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese resisting in Yueyang. They once stormed into Changanyi Station. The battle situation has now reached a stalemate. In the southwest of Nanchang, northern Jiangxi, more than a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery troops launched a fierce attack on Xiangfu Guan on the morning of the 20th. After being ambushed from both sides, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed, and the remaining Japanese troops retreated in defeat towards Dacheng. The Chinese army advancing towards Fengxin and Jing'an repeatedly captured Maxingshan and Baimaogang on the outskirts of Fengxin City, as well as Leigongjian and Wanjiana on the outskirts of Jing'an City. They have launched city sieges for days, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. After Wuningxi Shangdu was captured by the Chinese army last week, they took advantage of the victory and continued to advance, successively capturing Gutai, Putian Bridge, and Chaping Ao in various places. They approached the county seat and besieged it for several days. The Japanese forces are wavering and show signs of collapse. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu and the Northwest Lines are Both Counterattacking. The Japanese Army Has No Way to Open the Canal Transportation Line. The Chinese Army Has Entered Baoying City, Approaching Huai'an.</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: Since the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu launched a large-scale offensive on the first day of this month, attempting to open the canal transportation line, the Chinese army has fought bloody battles, giving them extremely serious blows. The Japanese army only obtained one or two empty cities. Up to now, the important towns along the canal line, such as Pingqiao, Huangpu, Sishui, and Jieshou, are still being guarded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in the Gaobao area is heavily surrounded by the Chinese army and is already on the verge of collapse. The reason why they continue to advance east of the canal line is only to contain the Chinese forces. At the moment, the Chinese military authorities, in addition to actively launching military counterattacks, are also intensifying passive defense works. All the important river crossings east of the canal line are being sealed off. The Chinese military officer in charge, ×××, personally went to the front line. In addition to instructing the commanders of the anti-Japanese troops on combat strategy, he also inspected the blockade lines to enhance the strength of the defense works.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Baoying on the Western Front</p>
<p>On the western front, the Chinese army counterattacking Baoying troops began to become active on the evening of the 16th after the newly arrived Chinese army ××× and ××× two regiments of reinforcements. A certain senior commander personally went to the front line to supervise the army, dividing the troops into three routes and advancing simultaneously. Around 11 o'clock at night, they arrived at the suburbs of Baoying, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and approaching the county town. After the Japanese army discovered it, they fired machine guns and cannons wildly at the four suburbs. The Chinese army also returned fire with machine guns, and a fierce battle ensued all night. At dawn on the 17th, the Chinese army selected a large number of daredevils, divided them and launched a fierce charge from the northeast two gates. Not fearing the Japanese army's rain of artillery fire, they advanced wave upon wave, breaking into the northeast two gates of Baoying. The Japanese army retreated and gathered in the southwest corner of the county town. The Chinese army, like a tide, rushed into the city in one fell swoop and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army, bayonet fighting, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. The Japanese army, holding about three hundred men in the city, had already been mostly killed or wounded by the Chinese army. Around 9 a.m., the southern route army of the Chinese forces also crossed the Minji River from Wangzhigang and tightly surrounded the southwest area of Baoying. A part of the heroic soldiers also broke in from the south gate and joined forces with the northern route Chinese army in the city. The remaining Japanese army held on to the houses in the southwest of the city, struggling desperately, waiting for reinforcements. The Chinese army surrounded the county town in two layers. As of the afternoon, they were still carrying out annihilation operations in fierce fighting. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than a hundred casualties, and the Chinese side also had heroic sacrifices.</p>
<p>Huai'an Besieged on the Northern Front</p>
<p>On the northern front, at dawn on the 17th, because a large number of strategic forces arrived and were briefly equipped, they immediately launched an attack on Huai'an County. The Japanese troops entrenched in various strongholds were defeated by the Chinese army. By night, they had taken advantage of the victory and advanced to various important strongholds in the suburbs of Huai'an, taking a siege posture against the city. It is said that the number of Japanese troops in Huai'an County was not very large, and there was no support that could be increased in various places. Now they have forcibly conscripted strong men to assist in the defense. It is expected that the Chinese army will get good results with a little deployment and attack.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army Attacked Hangzhou in the Four Suburbs of Hangzhou, and Street Fighting Occurred. Five Large Fires in the Bustling Urban Area. Tongxiang County Was Also Attacked.</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 20th, the Chinese army in the four suburbs of Hangzhou attacked Hangzhou City, rushed into Wulinmen, and a commando team risked climbing the Zhendong Tower, capturing the Japanese soldiers guarding the city alive. Later, the Japanese military headquarters in the city dispatched six or seventy more guarding soldiers, but they were still killed by the Chinese army attacking the city. After rushing into the city, they set fires immediately. Five places in Zhongqing Street, Pishi Lane, Qingtai Road, Dong Street, and Xuantan Alley in Hangzhou City caught fire. It is said that the factories and foreign firms opened by the Japanese were destroyed, including the Huasheng Tobacco Company, the distribution office of Sanyou Industrial Society (operated by the current Abe Yoko), Daimaru Yoko (on Baoyoufang Street), the Hangzhou Paper Factory, and the Japanese military barracks and the puppet pacification department clothing factory, which were almost affected by the fire. Therefore, the Japanese army was extremely panicked. It is expected that the Chinese army's general counterattack on Hangzhou is imminent. The four villages of Tongxiang have long been controlled by the Chinese army. The two forwards encountered the Japanese army in Lutou North and a battle broke out immediately. The Japanese army could not support it and collapsed one after another. The Morita unit of the Japanese army originally in Shimenwan was also resolved by the Chinese army. There was also a separate detachment of the Chinese army and the puppet pacification team engaged in fierce battles in the suburbs of Tongxiang. The Koizumi and Kumagai units of the Japanese army in the city also dispatched teams to reinforce. While the fighting was in full swing, the main force of the Chinese army arrived and took the opportunity to pounce on the county town.</p>
<p>Wangdian is the center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and its situation is critical. The number of Japanese troops entrenched in it is very small, and the guard troops along the railway are mostly replaced by the puppet pacification troops of Xu Pucheng's department. Recently, the Chinese army once captured Wangdian, and the momentum was very strong. They have been searching for traitors and executed many of them. The day before yesterday, two traitors who purchased steel auxiliary coins for the Japanese were also beheaded and shown to the public.</p>
<h3>Imported Goods Between Lanzhou and Pingliang are Extremely Expensive. The Price of Cigarettes is Appalling.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter received a letter from a relative in Pingliang, transferred from Lanzhou, stating that he received a letter from his family, saying that rice prices in Shanghai have soared and everything is expensive, presumably due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. The market price of imported goods in the Northwest is also rising. In Lanzhou, Great Britain brand cigarettes cost between two yuan and eight jiao and three yuan per can, Cannon cigarettes cost more than six yuan, Great Front Gate cigarettes cost more than four yuan, and Cigarette cost thirty-two yuan, which is appalling. The cost of living in Pingliang is lower than in Lanzhou, but it is not inferior to Shanghai. The roads are uneven and there are no street lights. Walking at night requires a hand-held lamp. Each candle costs more than two jiao. People from Shanghai who are accustomed to the material civilization are unaware of how difficult the daily lives of the people in the Northwest are.</p>

<h3>The crux of the problem and the improvement methods of childcare for refugee children (4) Qian Yonghe</h3>
<p>Lack of teachers. Although the education and upbringing of children is a new education cause in the Anti-Japanese War, in the beginning, due to the urgency of rescuing refugee children, there was no time to strictly select teachers, or to collect personnel nearby to assist, or to volunteer enthusiastically and be willing to fulfill their obligations. Therefore, the teachers in the academies are very uneven. Some graduated from practical academies, some graduated from high school, some were students in colleges or universities, and some had worked in tax bureaus and county offices. There are very few who have graduated from the education department of a university, a normal school, or a high school normal school and have experience serving in elementary schools. The personnel dispatched by the teachers' service corps are qualified and have a lot of experience, but they still lack the spirit of service for nurturing. Therefore, the untidy clothing of children, the uncleanness of residences, and the easy spread of diseases are mostly due to the lack of experience and sense of responsibility of teachers and staff. According to the orphanages, child care homes, or orphanages established by various refugee relief organizations and institutions, there are more than 70 academies. Each academy has an average of six levels, and each level needs two teachers. Each academy has one director, one director of affairs and education, and three or four other staff members, for a total of more than 1,330 people. It is not difficult to find qualified teachers and staff for these 1,330 people, but there is a shortage of people who have excellent academic performance, rich experience, can endure hardship and hard work, are smart and capable, can care for children, and treat them like their own.</p>
<p>Management of supplies. The children in each academy are all living in the academy, and the management of all living supplies is enough to show the quality of the results. No matter a book or a pen, the name or student number is marked on the item, especially the sewing of clothes and the purchase of shoes and socks. The size should be measured and fitted. When replacing, wash, dry, brush, or mend them, and store them in an orderly manner and try to make use of them, such as combining two old and broken mats into one, or changing old clothes and pants from large to small, or using old socks to make mops. If teachers and staff can cherish children's supplies as if they cherish their own belongings, and train children to cherish them as well, they are not afraid of trivial matters in the management of supplies. If they handle them in an orderly manner, they can save a lot of expenses. However, now, each academy is mostly limited by funds. When textbooks are issued, there are no notebooks. When pencils are prepared, there are no brushes. In winter, there is only one set of shirts and pants and cotton-padded jackets and pants. After putting them on, there is no replacement, and there are no gowns and pants. As a result, they are covered in lice and the cotton-padded pants are filthy and cannot be worn again in the second winter. The original intention was to save expenses, but it has become an uneconomical fact. Other paper, ink, paper, inkstones, towels, and toothbrushes all require experienced people to manage and distribute them in order to be orderly and truly save money. It all depends on the close cooperation of class teachers and clerks and child care workers, but many academies are located in remote rural areas, and it is not easy to purchase large quantities of goods. If they have this, they don't have that, or there is no storage room. Before the goods are distributed, they are lost, or the teachers and staff lack management experience, and the children often wear large shoes and large coats. The distribution is improper, and the whole academy shows a state of chaos and disorganization. The management of supplies is the most important thing in a place that combines education and upbringing.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned knot of refugee children's relief and upbringing, if it cannot be improved to a climax, in the future, although the government and refugee relief organizations will spend huge sums of money, it will still be difficult to show excellent results with hard work. The methods of improvement are briefly described below, focusing on a few important points.</p>
<p>Strengthen Rescue Effectiveness. During the first phase of the Anti-Japanese War, the refugee children near each war zone were rescued by members of various refugee relief organizations, and the special commissioners of each relief zone of the Relief Committee, and the general and branch stations of refugees in various places, assisted in receiving, transporting, and providing supplies. But in fact, due to traffic difficulties and lack of means of transportation, each refugee relief organization felt unable to transport to the rear after rescuing refugee children. The nursery association has transportation stations, and often hundreds to thousands of children are waiting for ships and cars at the transportation stations. Other organizations rescuing refugee children can only transport them to nearby orphanages or orphanages.</p>
<p>In order to increase the transportation of rescued refugee children, when members of each refugee relief organization are sent to designated locations to rescue refugee children, they should first contact the political workers of the political department, local governments, highway bureaus, shipping companies, refugee stations, hospitals, and clinics. Please ask the political workers to assist in persuading the people in the war zone to send children who are unable to raise and educate to the relief organizations for transportation to the rear for education. The local governments and refugee stations should take care of food and lodging and safety along the way. Highway bureaus, shipping companies, and other organizations should provide transportation. Hospitals and clinics should send doctors and nurses to diagnose and treat sick children. Cooperate in many ways so that refugee children can be transported to the rear for education as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Sales Exceed Purchases, Japanese Merchants Secretly Dumping, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank Sassoon's Buying Unsustainable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank's listed rates. The over-the-counter market for British and American currencies saw mixed fortunes, with the trend shifting from tight to loose. As Chinese merchants took the opportunity to trade, they were quite willing to sell. It was also rumored that speculators, known for their keen sense, who had previously taken large long positions at tight prices of 4 7/8 pence, were now eager to exit the market. This was due to the European situation, where Germany's attitude suddenly turned tough, vowing to resist to the end, making peace seem unlikely. Furthermore, the Chinese war situation was improving, and with the United States recently making every effort to aid China, the international situation became increasingly favorable. The prospects for the national currency became more stable. The morning saw the British and American exchange rates retracing to 7.5, leading to reports of a slightly tighter British currency and a firmer American currency. Subsequently, as Sassoon continued to buy, the British currency briefly tightened, reaching 4 7/8 pence, and the American exchange rate also contracted to 7.9375 yuan. However, as Japanese merchants secretly dumped their holdings and Sassoon no longer had the appetite to buy, and with Hong Kong dealers and Chinese merchants aggressively selling, the market price immediately turned from flat to soft. In addition, American banks like Chase and some other banks also intended to sell, further loosening the situation. By noon, the British currency had fallen to 4 9375 pence, and the American exchange rate had exceeded the 8 yuan mark, reaching 8.25 yuan. The afternoon saw an even more pronounced loosening trend, with more sales than purchases. The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank bought some British currency at 5 pence, and the American exchange rate was briefly seen at a loose price of 8.375 yuan. After hovering for half a day, the British currency closed at 4.96875 pence, easing 0.01875 from the previous day, while the American exchange rate was 8.3125 yuan, firming 0.03125 from the day before yesterday. There were still forward transactions, with a trend similar to the spot market. Overall, trading was brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate Re-emerges Above 8 Yuan</p>
<p>Early this morning, the recent London big bill retraced 0.05625, the forward rate fell 0.01875, the New York silver price fell 0.025, the London gold price remained unchanged, and the exchange rates between British, American, and French currencies were flat. The rate against Shanghai contracted 0.0125, the American rate against the British rate fell 0.0075, the rate against Shanghai fell 0.45 yuan, and the rate against the French rate fell 0.0125. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4.78125 pence for the British currency and 7.96875 yuan for the American exchange rate, which were flat for the British currency and firmer by 0.03125 for the American currency compared to the previous close, due to the retracement of exchange rates. After opening, the situation seemed slightly softer as Western merchant Sassoon continued to sell slightly. Sassoon bought spot British currency from a certain bank at 4.75 pence, while the American exchange rate was also quoted at 7.9375 yuan by the bank. The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly lower by 0.0375. Subsequently, Sassoon ceased buying, and someone unexpectedly took over the selling position of a certain party. Furthermore, American banks like Chase and a certain other bank also intended to sell, causing the British currency to immediately rebound to 4.8125 pence, and the American exchange rate also rebounded to 8.0625 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong Telecom also followed suit and sold, and Chinese merchants also came to dump their holdings, so the underlying trend became increasingly weaker, with the British currency reaching 4.9375 pence and the American exchange rate reaching 8.25 yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, the banks' spot selling prices were 4.90625 pence for the British currency and 8.1875 yuan for the American exchange rate, which were lower by 0.0125 for the British currency and firmer by 0.021875 for the American currency compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>British Currency Briefly Reached 5 Pence</p>
<p>In the after-market, the situation turned firmer again as Hong Kong dealers continued to sell and speculators came to close their positions. At its firmest, the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank absorbed spot British currency from Hong Kong Telecom and speculators at 5 pence. At the same time, the American spot exchange rate was also bought by a certain party from speculators at 8.25 to 8.375 yuan. At the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4.96875 pence for the British currency and 8.3125 yuan for the American exchange rate. The rates for this month were the same as the spot rates. The November rates were 4.921875 pence for the British currency and 8.21875 yuan for the American exchange rate. As a result, the British currency was firmer by 0.01875 and the American currency was firmer by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's current rates.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 26th - This morning, the exchange market opened steadily. The British and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged, while the American spot exchange rate tightened by 0.0625 to 25.0625 yuan. The forward rate was not quoted. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1 yuan to 303 yuan (yesterday's close was 304 yuan). At 10:35 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by 5 yuan to 308 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was calm with no gains or losses. The afternoon close saw the Shanghai spot exchange rate fall by 6 yuan to 302 yuan. At 2:30 PM, the market opened flat, and the Shanghai spot exchange rate continued to fall by 6 yuan to 296 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Exchange Rates Retract</p>
<p>Tianjin, 26th - Today, the exchange market opened flat in the morning. The British spot exchange rate tightened by 0.0125 to 4.75 pence, and the American spot exchange rate also contracted by 0.025 to 7.875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 3.5 yuan to 103.5 yuan. The "Joint Currency" over-the-counter rate rose sharply by 5.5 yuan to 93.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Weak and Unable to Recover, Hong Kong Dealers' Aggressive Buying Slightly Reverses the Downtrend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold dark market conditions were barely satisfactory, with a result of only a 42 yuan drop. The reason was frequent easing in foreign exchange. Drops of 50 yuan and 100 yuan were also expected. The fact that it closed so firm shows that the ups and downs of the gold market have become irregular. The opening was still flat, down slightly by 2 yuan from the previous day, at 3,820 yuan. Then, with the foreign exchange market slightly softer, it rose to 3,840 yuan. Suddenly, as exchange rates firmed, gold shops and securities firms sold off heavily, and the market suddenly declined, reaching 3,745 yuan by noon. As the afternoon session opened, sales continued, and although guest dealers continued to buy, they felt that the trend was difficult to reverse, with the smallest price being 3,735 yuan. Unexpectedly, a rumor spread, and the final rebound was unusually strong. Hong Kong dealers came to the market to buy, in large quantities. Although there was no shortage of people supplying, it was eventually raised to 3,745 yuan. However, it eventually closed at 3,780 yuan, with brisk trading of around 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops quoted 5 yuan less, and customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Falls 42 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (10 taels) - the initial opening was peaceful. At first, Qian Dui Ye (money exchange shops) bought 20 taels from gold shops, at 3,820 yuan, which was 2 yuan less than the previous close. There were few rumors that foreign exchange was soft, and Hong Kong dealers also began to buy. In an instant, it was raised by 20 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 50 taels from Qian Dui Ye, at 3,840 yuan. At this time, morale was still enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, foreign exchange suddenly eased, and Hong Kong dealers had enough appetite to eat it up. In addition, securities firms came out to heavily suppress the market. Before long, the market fell 43 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to Qian Dui Ye, at 3,797 yuan. At that time, Qian Dui Ye had a little appetite, and Hong Kong dealers also absorbed more than 100 taels. The situation stabilized slightly, and it once rebounded to 3,815 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop suddenly came to sell, and foreign exchange became increasingly hard. Retail investors also supplied more than they demanded. For a time, there was a lack of support, and it suddenly plummeted 65 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 30 taels to the gold shop, at 3,750 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop profited and made up for it, pulling up 20 yuan, buying 50 taels from Qian Dui Ye at a price of 3,770 yuan. At noon, the selling spree was rekindled because foreign exchange continued to harden. Securities firms came out to dump again, and it fell again by 25 yuan, selling 30 taels to the gold shop, at 3,745 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was calm. The gold shop bought 30 taels from Qian Dui Ye, still at 3,745 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong dealers continued to buy, pulling up 15 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 20 taels from Qian Dui Ye, at 3,760 yuan. After that, Hong Kong dealers temporarily took a wait-and-see approach, and foreign exchange trends eased again, causing a selling spree from securities firms, etc., falling 15 yuan. They sold 30 taels to silver shops, priced at 3,715 yuan. After entering the market, Hong Kong dealers' buying interest became stronger, so they entrusted a certain gold shop, a certain silver shop, and a certain Qian Dui Ye to buy aggressively. Although Qian Dui Ye and silver shops heard that the British currency had reached 5 pence and came to sell, the head position was still insufficient, and it was raised by 50 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from Qian Dui Ye at a price of 3,785 yuan. After Hong Kong dealers temporarily stopped buying, it immediately fell back down. Qian Dui Ye sold 10 taels to the securities firm, at a price of 3,760 yuan. Near the evening close, Hong Kong dealers unexpectedly showed their remaining power again, raising it by 20 yuan. A certain Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from a fellow dealer, at 3,780 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell 42 yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the close, a certain Qian Dui Ye absorbed a total of 30 taels from silver shops and gold shops, priced at 3,785 yuan. The price fluctuated by 105 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than cash gold, and the buying price was 20 yuan less. The current bid price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>Jewelry is Quoted 5 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was still 385 yuan by large establishments. By noon at 12 o'clock, it was quoted 5 yuan lower. Since then, there have been no changes. Large establishments changed the quote to 380 yuan, and new establishments had the same price as the above price. The buying price must be reduced by 15 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Weak Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a decline in demand for British and American gold pounds due to the renewed easing of foreign exchange. The supply of British and American gold notes was relatively abundant, and the market was weak. The demand for Hong Kong notes was not high, and they trended slightly lower. French franc notes were in demand and were uniquely firm. Singapore and rupee notes weakened following the easing of exchange rates. The supply of Japanese gold notes increased, and the market was slightly soft, with the evening price being 1.1315 yuan. Korean notes were still scarce, and the market was slightly higher, with the evening price being 1.096 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds and British gold notes fell by 0.5 yuan, American gold pounds fell by 1 yuan, American gold notes fell by 0.2 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.02 yuan, French franc notes rose by 0.0002 yuan, Singapore notes fell by 0.1 yuan, rupee notes fell by 0.05 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities Minor Fluctuations in Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>Yesterday's over-the-counter market for public bonds was quite stable, with the difference between buying and selling being no more than 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. The trend was low and then high, and morale was still very strong. However, the environment and news were dull, and most parties were waiting and watching, causing the range of rises and falls to gradually narrow, and there was also a hovering situation. There was no good news, and the future may be small. Yesterday, most of the transactions of the various groups were scattered. The 11th and 20th issues were mostly bought, and Tian Sheng and others always sold. Dafeng and Yongkang and other houses formed a situation of advancing first and then exiting, forming a stalemate. As a result, the ups and downs were extremely minor. Only Grade C was slightly better by 0.05, and Grades A and B were slightly smaller by 0.05. Grades B and E had no fluctuations at all. The total transaction volume was in the order of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 58.55 58.35 58.55 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified B 50.55 50.40 50.55 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified C 48.80 48.50 48.80 Up 0.05</p>
<p>Unified D 48.55 48.45 48.55 Flat</p>
<p>Unified E 48.90 48.75 48.90 Flat</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of stock were traded at the local exchange, priced at 28.75 yuan. The payment certificates issued by the local exchange are gradually increasing in demand, and the discount is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Association of All Trades saw a sudden shift in trend to lively activity in the afternoon as new accounts entered the market, and prices generally strengthened. However, the upward momentum of the species was not sustained, and although the market situation was still firm at the close, it had already fallen slightly. International Trust Company, Hong Feng, Rui Rong, China Reclamation Company, Steel Industry, and Jardine Spinning Mill stocks accounted for most of the total daily volume.</p>
<p>London, 25th - Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower tiers of bonds.</p>
<p>London, 25th - Today's listed prices of British merchant Far East company stocks: bank stocks continued to rise, with Mercantile Bank shares rising 2 shillings 6 pence to £7.5, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation London-registered shares rising 0.5 pound to £76, and Hong Kong-registered shares rising 1 pound to £77. Chartered Bank shares also rose 2 shillings 6 pence to £10.15. Only Kuala Klang Rubber shares fell 3 pence to 16 shillings, while the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Scattered Transactions, Outlook Still Healthy</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to move forward. At the same time, although the demand from southern Hong Kong dealers for coarse yarn was subtle, scattered consumption was still healthy, so morale was tight. Recently, Ningbo in Zhejiang has seen some purchasing due to the departure of ships, so some have a more stable mentality and have come to take it back. In fact, it has fallen sharply for several days, so there is naturally a rebound and recovery. If the current sales can be followed closely, the foundation will be solid and can be expected to rise. Otherwise, it may still be in a state of revolving stagnation. Observing the current environment, the exchange rate is loose, and raw cotton is still firm. The two sides are still in conflict.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot goods in the morning continued the upward trend of the previous day, immediately rising by more than 10 yuan. At this time, speculators swarmed in an uproar. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 673 yuan. The selling spree suddenly rose and fell more than 10 yuan with no changes in foreign exchange, priced at 660 yuan. After a while, market rumors arose again, all in favor of the multi-party, and buying sentiment recovered. In an instant, it returned to between 673 and 678 yuan, and the closing was still stable. However, the yarn of other brands was still flat and weak. A total of 2,090 bales were traded in half a day. The market quotations were: 20-count Change Horse rose 21.5 yuan, Heavenly Girl rose 16 yuan, and Double Earth rose 19 yuan. The factory, Yong'an Factory, opened 300 bales of 20-count special Jin Cheng, priced at 675 yuan, and 300 bales of 10-count special Jin Cheng, priced at 510 yuan. Today, 160 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 475 Fellow Traders 1,410</p>
<p>Fuzhou 50 Ningbo 70</p>
<p>Jiangxi 20 Inland 65</p>
<p>Statistics 2,090</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Watching, Rural Market Prices Not Cheap, Transportation Profits Thin</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were slightly clearer, and transactions from all parties declined. Factories still had no activity. Although yarn prices have rebounded, the exchange rate has also eased, so manufacturers' thoughts are still indifferent. Although the source is continuous, the market price in the countryside is not cheap. In addition, road transportation fees and taxes are heavy, resulting in high costs. The profits of traders are so thin that market prices cannot fall. Yesterday, sales of Ignition and Tongzhou cotton rose by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan. 2,496 bales of Subai to Tong cotton arrived, and 330 bales were transported from Beisha. Today (27th), 300 bales were transported to Hong Kong, and 400 pieces of Ignition cotton were transported to Tianjin. The current cotton sales list (notes delivered to the warehouse) is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 130.00 Fellow Traders 200 Bales</p>
<p>Also 128.50 130.00 Fellow Traders 800 Bales</p>
<p>Ignition Flower 121.50 123.00 Fellow Traders 500 Bales</p>
<p>Another message: Yesterday morning, the exchange rate for Shanghai foreign cotton transactions was flat, and in the afternoon it tended to loosen. All fellow traders did not intend to take any action because the exchange rate could not be determined. Factories are planning to open a batch of cotton yarn these days, and may purchase raw cotton in the future. Yesterday's market transactions were very quiet.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: New York cotton market opened in a firm state in the early morning. It rose first due to the purchase of speculators and the good spot transaction, and then the market was very firm due to the high stock market and the purchase of overseas cotton merchants. As a result, the closing market price rose eight or nine pounds. The Indian cotton market was quiet, the Egyptian cotton market rose more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool rose 35 pence.</p>
<h3>Grains New Rice Arrives, Sales Prices Steady</h3>
<p>The rice market has seen a settlement. Since it had fallen once before noon, it aroused the local patrons to take action yesterday. From morning to noon, the purchase intention was very strong. At the same time, there were more inland gangs absorbing the premium, and the situation reversed from fatigue to tightness. By noon, new goods from various districts arrived one after another, reaching more than 4,000 bags. People were inevitably affected. The sellers were more willing to sell. As a result, the sales were strong, and the supply and demand were matched. Therefore, the closing market was unchanged. The Changxi Special New Japonica rice still opened at 31 yuan, second to 27 yuan, broken japonica rice 30 yuan, second to 267 yuan, Sutongchangkun New Japonica rice special from 29 yuan, second to 26 yuan, broken japonica rice was in short supply, Qingjiao mixed species remained at 30 yuan and 5 cents, Wild rice was 31 yuan to 30 yuan and 5 cents, Fengjia Baige special goods were 29 yuan, second to 27 yuan, Songjiang Baige was 17 yuan to 26 yuan and 5 cents, slightly broken was 26 yuan, Nangang White rice was 19 yuan, Early broken was 25 yuan and 23 cents, Special Moujian was 23 yuan and a half, second to 21 yuan, Special Lujian was 24 yuan, second to 22 yuan and a half, Kejian Early Kai Wuhu and Nanjing special goods were still 19 yuan and 8 corners, and later the market was slightly raised by 2 or 3 corners to 20 yuan after being absorbed by the inland gangs, second to 18 yuan and a half, Jiangbei Jian was 19 yuan and 8 corners to 19 yuan and a half, Chen Yuan was 30 yuan to 28 or 9 yuan, and Xin Yuan was 26 yuan and a half to 25 yuan. The total transaction volume in the city was no less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Another message: The market for foreign Xian rice showed outstanding conditions. The brokers reported that the price of Jiangbei products was not loose, and it was difficult to profit from transportation. In addition, the Shanghai market price was low, and there was more exclusive Wuhu rice from the east, so most of them stopped transporting. In addition to the retail household continuous operation outside this street, the inland gangs also had continuous packaging due to the low price, so the market improved again, but because of the large accumulation of stocks, the east bank lowered the price of Wuhu, so it still followed the market retail release. Therefore, although the market was tight, the market was only 1 or 2 corners.</p>
<h3>Flour Guest Orders Still Upright, Wheat Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour transactions gradually turned sluggish. Both the North and South gangs had greed, but the factories were unwilling to supply large quantities, and the goods previously handled by the guest gang were not cleared, so new transactions have declined. The market is limited, and the retail price on this street is still only 7.3 yuan. The factory does not increase in order to maintain it, and the unified market transaction volume is less than 30,000 bags. Guest orders continue to open at 7.4 yuan, and the Cannon Cart brand still needs a price of 7.5 yuan. The market is brewing, and 8,000 bags of flour were transported to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's arrival was still rare. Due to the firm and expensive production price, the sellers insisted on staying in the warehouse and waiting for the opportunity to sell. The flow of goods in the market is decreasing day by day. The factories also need more raw materials after the recent active powder sales, and the hoarders also pulled it in. The market is stepping up, and the Unified Market Fuxin and Fufeng factories handle more than 20,000 bags of Changxi Jingsu and Guandian wheat. The hoarders also bought five or six cars, and the highest price has reached 11 yuan, which is a sharp increase of 3 to 4 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Soybeans and Sesame, Different Tendencies</h3>
<p>Recently, the source of soybeans has been blocked from time to time, so few large batches have arrived. Although there is no possibility of procurement for the inland sales, the South China gang has a strong desire. This street is also very enthusiastic. The market price has risen. Yesterday, 7 or 800 bags of Wuhu beans opened at a price of 13.5 yuan, 500 bags of Taicang beans at 14 yuan, 200 bags of Anqing beans at 14.1 yuan to 13.9 yuan, 140 bags of Guidet beans at 13.9 yuan, and 300 bags of Jiujiang Late beans at 15 yuan. The export path of sesame is restricted by the exchange rate, which causes it to watch and not move. Generally, the hoarders' stomachs are therefore idle. Yesterday, only this street took 50 bags of Yangzhou sesame at 28.5 yuan, and the market quotation was 6 or 7 yuan lower than the previous market.</p>
<p>Today there are 800 bags of beans, 190 bags of sesame, 2,540 cans of vegetable oil, 200 cans of sesame oil, all transported to Hong Kong. There are also 1,100 bags of mung beans transported to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sliced Green Opens More Than a Thousand Baskets</h3>
<p>28 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, coarse white was slightly loose. The association's market price for this warehouse's spot goods was 54 yuan, the outside warehouse was 55 yuan, old goods were 54 yuan, re-export goods were 42.5 yuan, Taikoo Che Bai B mark was 58.8 yuan to 8.5 yuan, Che Chi and He Chi had no ups and downs, Ben Mianbai and Ben Bing both fell by 0.5 yuan. The National Sugar Sliced Green opened 1,100 baskets of Beihai goods at 28 yuan, which was 10 yuan smaller than the highest price. Ordinary Huizhou Bai, more than 40 bags, was 53 yuan. It is heard that Shantou sugar has a foreign sugar tax, and if it is true, it is expected to rise.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Peaches, Apricots, and Red Dates All Rise</h3>
<p>Two batches of new Tianjin red dates and recently arrived Leling goods have opened yesterday. Hengda had 48 bags, Zao Wang rose to 230 yuan, Shuangfu head household was 85 yuan, Shuanglu second household was 65 yuan, Fugui Youtou household was 40 yuan, and Tongyichang opened a batch of Changping peaches, 75 yuan, Fuxingxiang opened 12 bags of Leling red dates, Zao Wang was 140 yuan, Gaohongzaotou household was 130 yuan, the same price for the first and second households, and Hengda opened dragon king hat almonds at a higher price of 360 yuan, the next one was 340 yuan, bitter apricots were 128 yuan, and miscellaneous red dates included Changhong red dates at 22 yuan, Zou County Fu Hong called 37.5 yuan, the next one was 36 yuan to 34 yuan, Haozhou peach rose by 3 yuan and traded at 55 yuan, black dates were still weak, opening at 70 yuan to more than 30 yuan. 2,500 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Heroic Loyalty and Martyrdom Re-emerge in My Mind, The Second Anniversary of the Lone Army, Commander Xie's Speech Encouraged Everyone to Stand Guard, Shanghai People Enthusiastically Participated in the Commemoration Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the 88th Division Lone Army's old battle at the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei. The 400 officers and soldiers of the Sihang Lone Army, residing in the Lone Army barracks on Jiaozhou Road, under the leadership of Commander Xie Jinyuan, specially held a commemoration ceremony yesterday afternoon. More than a hundred guests from all walks of life participated. The situation at that time was extremely heroic and enthusiastic. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Four Hundred Warriors in High Spirits</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Lone Army's old battle at the Sihang Warehouse, and the White Russian team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stationed at the Lone Army barracks on Jiaozhou Road had especially strict precautions. Armed White Russian Volunteers patrolled around from time to time. Yesterday, more than 100 representatives from all walks of life participated, and some presented souvenirs such as mirror frames. The commemoration venue was set up in the open space in front of the auditorium. A pine and cypress arch was erected in front of the auditorium, with the Party emblem and the Premier's last words hanging on it. On that day, the four hundred warriors were all in high spirits and full of enthusiasm, allowing the people of the isolated island to see the heroic posture of the National Army again, and could not help but be excited.</p>
<h3>Eloquent and Passionate Speech by the Battalion Commander</h3>
<p>At approximately 3:00 PM, a memorial was held with all the visiting guests of the Lone Battalion. Commander Xie delivered a speech, briefly stating, "Today marks the day our battalion entered the Sihang Warehouse to begin the resistance. The five days until the 30th were a period of fighting the enemy within the Sihang Warehouse. The 31st marks the day we retreated under the order of the Supreme Commander, which is also</p>
<p>Our Miserable Life</p>
<p>The beginning of our two-year anniversary. Among the guests present today are: firstly, families of officers and soldiers; secondly, compatriots who have enthusiastically served our battalion; thirdly, leading figures in the cultural sector; and others who have shared life and death with us. It can be said that those who participate today are all on the same battle line. Our goals are the same, our steps are consistent, and we all advance towards the supreme</p>
<p>Nation Above All Else</p>
<p>Nationality above all else. We strive for revival, survival, and a bright and great avenue. However, each person's position is different. Therefore, what I must report first can also be said to be a regular family report, and I ask for your guidance. Recalling 1936, our division had already prepared for the Shanghai war. At that time, the designated defense area of our division started from Wusong Town, eastward through the Wusong Fort, and northeastward through the Shizilin Fort, to Liuhe, Yanglinkou, and Qiyakou. The person in charge of our division was responsible for</p>
<p>Terrain Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Operational deployments, mobilization, transportation plans, etc. Around May 1937, the defense area changed, and we were transferred from Wusong to Zhabei. From this time until August 13, Jin Yuan was making battle deployments in the vicinity of Shanghai. Our division mobilized around the Xicheng area on the evening of August 11 and arrived in Shanghai. Later, Yuan led a battalion to defend the Sihang Warehouse to the death, and then received</p>
<p>Supreme Commander</p>
<p>Orders to retreat. For a soldier, obedience is paramount. Seeking to avoid danger in the face of adversity is not the action of a soldier. However, from the beginning, I determined that regardless of future environmental changes, safety, or danger, I would never care. The honor of the country and the personality of revolutionary soldiers must stand firm and not compromise in the slightest. The leader's instructions are: life and death are small matters, personality is a major matter. In the past two years, my every word and action has been based on this principle to deal with the environment. And recalling the life of the past two years, in</p>
<p>Material Terms</p>
<p>We have never been concerned. What we cannot tolerate is spiritual suffering. I have made three official requests for release. In short, the current responsibility of the people is to resist Japan and build the country, which is an inevitable and arduous part of the national revolution. Compatriots should not forget the</p>
<p>Words of Gold</p>
<p>"The nation is in peril, every citizen is responsible." The eight months of the war are not simple or easy. All Chinese citizens should guard their posts and do their best, according to the principle of contributing money and strength, and then they will surely achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Bridge No. 34 on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<h3>Already Blown Up</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops in Fengjing Surrounded and Annihilated</p>
<p>Civilians in Xitang Massacred</p>
<p>The mobile units of the Chinese regular army, which were continuously moving north from the source of the Qiantang River, arrived at their designated locations along both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area, and began active operations. The safety of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is now a thing of the past, and it is in danger of being cut off by the Chinese army at any time. Between the 21st and 22nd, a large number of fully armed Chinese troops, from an unknown location, launched a large-scale encirclement and attack on the Japanese stronghold in Fengjing Town, which borders Jiangsu and Zhejiang. There was also sufficient prior deployment, and all telegraph lines were cut off, causing dozens of Japanese troops at Fengjing Station to be like turtles in a jar,</p>
<p>Suffering Annihilation</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a separate team of engineers was dispatched to destroy two foreign railway bridges between Shihudang and Fengjing at night, including the famous Bridge No. 34. In fact, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been interrupted due to the destruction of the bridge. After completing the major mission, the Chinese army triumphantly withdrew. The next morning, Japanese troops from Jiashan and Songjiang received the report and dispatched reinforcements, suspecting that the Chinese army came from Xitang Town, 30 miles west of Fengjing, so they sent a team to Xitang,</p>
<p>Surrounding All Sides</p>
<p>However, the town was inhabited entirely by villagers, without a single Chinese soldier. They indiscriminately set fire to some of the houses, and many civilians were sacrificed. According to the victims who fled to Shanghai the night before, they walked to Songjiang before being able to take a bus to Shanghai. The bridge destroyed by the Chinese army is under repair, so the train has not been able to pass through there.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers at the Post Office Went on Strike Yesterday En Masse Demanding Uniform Subsidies Zha Peilin Has Not Expressed His Opinion It Is Uncertain Whether Work Will Resume Today</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 personnel, including postal workers, coolies, and other staff below the rank of postal workers, from the Postal Administration and its affiliated branches and inland bureaus, went on strike suddenly due to the subsidy issue. This matter had not been resolved as of last night, so it is still uncertain whether the post office will be able to resume the transportation and delivery of mail today. After the incident occurred, in order to avoid accidents, the police dispatched a patrol car and sent several Chinese and foreign police officers and detectives to suppress the area around the Postal Administration. They remained on guard until late at night, with the situation unresolved.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Strike Originated from Subsidies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's strike by postal workers, coolies, and all personnel below them was caused by the subsidy issue. It originated from the Postal Headquarters' approval to provide a universal subsidy of 7.5 yuan to postal workers in Shanghai with salaries below 190 yuan, including postal messengers and coolies, starting in July. However, recently, the Shanghai Post Office received instructions from the Headquarters to revise the regulations, increasing the subsidy for postal staff with salaries below 190 yuan to 10 yuan, while the subsidy for messengers, postal coolies, and other staff below them remained at 7.5 yuan. Upon learning of the above news, all messengers and other staff believed that the subsidy was to compensate for the loss caused by soaring prices, similar to the nature of the subsidy increase in 1930 due to the cheapness of silver and high cost of gold, and should not be differentiated by salary level. Therefore, they submitted a request to the Postal Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, requesting that the subsidy for messengers and other personnel be universally increased to 15 yuan. Before the Postal Headquarters approved it, they agreed to follow the example of postal staff and increase it to 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Strike Occurred Suddenly on Payday</h3>
<p>The above request was rejected by the Shanghai Postal Director, Zha Peilin, on the grounds that it needed to be submitted to the Postal Headquarters for review and approval before it could be handled according to the Headquarters' instructions. The opinions of both parties differed, and the disagreement brewed until yesterday morning. Because the payday of the post office (28th) was approaching, the strike occurred. Yesterday's sudden strike occurred at 9:00 AM, so the express mail, registered mail, and regular mail shifts of the Headquarters still departed and distributed as usual at 8:00 AM. The departure time of the early shifts of messengers at various branches was 9:00 AM, so they stopped departing and distributing. After 10:00 AM, postal workers, messengers, chauffeurs, and machinists all took the same action, causing the work of importing and exporting packages to foreign countries to come to a standstill. However, although the postal workers took a strike stance, they all reported to their service bureaus as usual, stayed at the bureaus as usual, and followed the office hours to enter and leave, and the order was still very orderly.</p>
<h3>Postal Authorities Have Not Expressed Anything</h3>
<p>The postal workers then formed a delegation, with each unit sending six representatives, from 18 units, including the regular mail group, express mail group, and mechanic group (based on groups) directly under the Administration, and the branch bureaus and inland bureaus (based on bureaus). Each of the six representatives elected a chairman to form a presidium to supervise all postal workers. It was also learned that the delegation discussed at the postal office at 4:00 PM yesterday and decided to continue petitioning the postal authorities for an increase in subsidies today. A reporter from the Datong News Agency visited Wang Weisheng, the Postal Superintendent, at 5:00 PM yesterday. According to Wang, Postal Director Zha Peilin forwarded the workers' request to the Postal Headquarters for review and approval on the 18th of this month, and then sent a telegram to inquire again on Tuesday of this week. Therefore, before the Headquarters responds, it is not convenient to express anything. Unexpectedly, this kind of incident occurred suddenly today. The post office is a public service undertaking and cannot be suspended even for a moment. He believed that the postal workers would resume work today, and also said that the bureau maintained the delivery of express mail as usual yesterday, and all departments also worked as usual.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Border Second Meeting to Be Held Next Week The Municipal Council's Proposal Is Still Being Drafted The Pseudo-Side's Preliminary Conditions Have Been Rejected</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the border, judging from the development in recent days, the Municipal Council and the Pseudo-Municipal Government have a strong atmosphere of compromise, and it seems that there is hope for an immediate resolution. However, according to news obtained by foreigners yesterday, during the meeting between Frankling and Fu Xiaoan on the evening of the 23rd, Fu proposed two preliminary conditions, requesting that the Municipal Council recognize the Pseudo-Municipal Government's authority to manage all police and administrative affairs of the roads beyond the border, before there would be room for discussion. Frankling did not accept it at the time and put forward several counter-proposals. As of yesterday, the Municipal Council publicly stated, "It will never give up its important rights and interests regarding road construction beyond the border." What are the important rights and interests? Police power and administrative power. Whether Frederick's draft "Proposal Outline" is to acknowledge the preliminary conditions put forward by Fu Xiaoan and formulate a plan is currently impossible to know. However, according to observations in diplomatic circles, because the desires of the pseudo-side are very extravagant, the prospect of negotiations is not very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Three Negotiations to Be Held Next Week</h3>
<p>The Public Concession authorities maintained extreme silence yesterday regarding the plan to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, which is currently being drafted, and refused to disclose the content. A reporter visited Frederick, the Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday. Frederick said that the proposal had not yet been drafted. The reporter asked what kind of proposal would be sent to Fu Xiaoan. Frederick replied that he was not prepared to make any statements. However, it was learned from other well-informed sources that the Municipal Council's proposal would be sent to the Pseudo-Municipal Government within the week, and formal negotiations between the representatives of both parties would begin next week. As for the situation of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, it remained normal yesterday. Municipal Council police were still on high alert in the area, and patrol cars were also patrolling back and forth. At the same time, many residents of the roads beyond the border were looking for houses to prepare for relocation, because they were afraid that after the negotiations were concluded, some parts of the area would not be very suitable for living.</p>
<p>Council Discussing Proposal Content</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that Frederick, the Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, and Major Bowen, the Chief of the Police Department, were drafting several proposals yesterday (25th) aimed at resolving the dispute over the roads outside the western district. When the plan reaches the final stage, it will be submitted to the "Special Municipal Government" "Mayor Su Fu Xiaoan. It is expected that this proposal will be submitted within this week. According to Frederick, the details of the proposal will not be announced until some agreement is reached between the two authorities. It is heard that the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday afternoon in order to complete the plan to be submitted by the Council to the Jiangwan "Municipal Government" as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Both Parties Put Forward Preliminary Conditions</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was heard from responsible sources that when the Public Concession authorities, Fu Xiaoan, the Japanese Consul General, and the Consular Corps held an informal discussion on Monday, Fu put forward two requirements as "preliminary conditions" for resolving the issue of roads outside the border. Fu's requirements were (1) complete police power in the disputed area and (2) complete management power. However, it is acknowledged that the Council did not accept these requirements and put forward a counter-proposal. The content of the counter-proposal has not been disclosed. It is also heard that the "Municipal Government" has not accepted this counter-proposal.</p>
<p>Extending the Vehicle Tax Is Only a Courtesy</p>
<p>Fu Xiaoan told reporters yesterday that these two issues are preliminary conditions for resolving the entire problem. When these requirements are accepted, he is willing to study the financial aspects of the incident, and will inquire about how much the Public Concession Standing Bureau spends in the area outside the border and the amount of taxes collected in the area, and will consider the "profit and loss statement" in order to fairly resolve the financial issues. The date of the continued meeting has not been determined. Fu also denied saying that he had made concessions on the issue of collecting "vehicle taxes" in the western district, and said that the collection date was originally set for November 1st, but it was only a courtesy that he delayed the date. Two months later, the vehicle tax will be collected additionally.</p>
<p>Japanese Police in the Western District Requested to Withdraw</p>
<p>Regarding the Public Concession Police Department strengthening its police force outside the border in response to the current state of lawlessness in the area, a Japanese newspaper once stated that there were no Japanese police officers among the police personnel dispatched to the western district. It has now been confirmed that the Japanese police officers stationed in the western district requested to withdraw three weeks ago, because they strongly opposed being on duty in the area, as it was contrary to Japanese policy. Also, the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that Frederick and Bowen continued to draft proposals yesterday (26th) to be submitted to Fu Xiaoan, and there were no other developments.</p>
<p>The Situation in Western Shanghai Remains Tense</p>
<p>The repeated disputes over road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai have deeply aroused the attention of the citizens of this city. Since the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" held mutual talks, the situation in western Shanghai has been slightly stable in the past two days. In addition to the Police Department dispatching additional detectives to Yuyuan Road, Jessfield Road, Great Western Road, and Edinburgh Road, British garrison troops have also built a fortress each at the intersection of Yuyuan Road, the intersection of Edinburgh Road, and the intersection of Great Western Road for defense. At the same time, police officers wearing yellow uniforms" are still directing traffic at various intersections. There are also "armed police" with rifles stationed near Zhaofeng Park, so Jessfield Road and other places with heavy traffic have become deserted, while Connaught Road has become an important transportation route.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Day Today It Is Decided to Forgo Extravagance Due to the Overall Situation There Is No Commemorative Program and No Visitors Are Allowed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the U.S. Navy will observe the Navy Day on October 27th, as in the past, to show the progress and achievements of the U.S. fleet. It is heard that the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai will not follow the example of previous years this year. Due to the global situation, it has been decided to forgo the usual commemorative program and not allow American citizens to board the U.S. ships in Shanghai for visits. Moreover, the U.S. ships in Shanghai will not be decorated as usual</p>
<p>Navy Program</p>
<p>As in previous years. President Roosevelt has declared this day a holiday. The United States will undoubtedly celebrate this holiday enthusiastically as usual, but in Shanghai, this holiday will pass quietly without any commemorative activities. The reason why the United States chose October 27th as the Navy Day is because it is the</p>
<p>U.S. President</p>
<p>The birthday of Theodore Roosevelt, who advocated vigorously developing the navy during his tenure. The establishment of the famous American "Great White Fleet" during World War I was largely due to his efforts. Another interesting thing is that American law stipulates that warships must be named after the names of various states, while other warships are named according to</p>
<p>Traditional Customs</p>
<p>For example, cruisers are named after cities, destroyers are named after naval ministers or naval heroes, aircraft carriers are named after famous battles, and submarines are named after fish. Other examples include naval transport ships named after marine generals, tugboats named after rivers, minesweepers named after birds, coal ships named after stars, and medical ships named "Mercy" "Relief" and other names.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Side Forcibly Relocating Orphanage Middle School</p>
<p>No. 11 Jessfield Road, a part of the 31st Refugee Shelter, the elderly and those with no support, were all sent to the No. 1 Shelter of the Dunxin Road Association yesterday. However, it is heard that the Orphanage Middle School is now encountering the same fate as the Refugee Shelter and has also received a notice from the Japanese puppet government to relocate within a time limit. The sponsoring charity group is unable to cope with the situation due to environmental constraints and has decided to close the school. Regarding the post-closure arrangements for the orphans, it is stipulated that those with families will be dispersed, and the rest will be arranged by the Education Department of the Refugee Relief Association.</p>
<p>The Incident of Robbing Weapons and the Border Area</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM yesterday, Si Kai at No. 754, Lane 171, Yanping Road, was suddenly attacked by four thugs and robbed of a pistol he was wearing. The trend of thugs attacking patrolmen and stealing pistols seems to have spread to the border area of the concession, so the border area of the concession, such as Edinburgh Road, Yuyuan Road, and Robison Road, was heavily guarded by the concession authorities from yesterday, and armored vehicles patrolled back and forth all day long.</p>
<p>The Northern District Issue Has Reached a Deadlock</p>
<p>The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy mentioned the issue of road construction beyond the border in the northern district of Suzhou River at the press conference the day before, saying that it had already reached the point of resolution. Due to the Jessfield Road incident, the negotiations were on the verge of breaking down. On August 22, the Japanese Consul Miura Yoshiaki wrote to the Municipal Council, stating, "In view of the Jessfield Road incident, the Japanese side has decided to postpone the return of the Hongkou area to the concession authorities." This means that the issue of road construction beyond the border in the Hongkou district has reached a deadlock again.</p>
<h3>Language Exhibition Opens on the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>The language exhibition has been prepared for a long time.

The exhibition date has been set for November 3rd and will be held on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company for a period of ten days.

<h3>Yuan Ying's Whereabouts Have Been Revealed Detained in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Yuan Ying, the chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, who was arrested at the Yuanming Sutra Lecture Hall on Great Western Road a few days ago, has been missing for nine days since the incident. Although various parties have tried to rescue him, he has not been released. He is still secretly detained in a certain military unit in Jiangwan, but he is still treated well.</p>
<h3>Tram Token Coupons Still Difficult to Recover Shanghai Tram Company's Letter States The Number of Fractional Coupons Is Truly Insufficient</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of fractional currency coupon circulation, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation recently sent a letter to the Central Bank, requesting the prompt issuance of the second batch of fractional currency coupons, and also sent a letter to the Shanghai Tram Company and the French Concession Tram Company, requesting that they recover the price coupons within a time limit, so that the transitional state caused by the lack of small change can come to an end as soon as possible. The Federation received a letter from the Shanghai Tram Company yesterday, stating that the new fractional currency coupons have been circulated in the market, and it is requested that our company recover the tram price coupons within a time limit. After observing our company, the number of new fractional currency coupons in circulation is truly insufficient, so our company's tram price coupons are currently indispensable for passengers to redeem. Our company also sincerely hopes that your Federation can promptly request the Central Bank to expedite the issuance of the new fractional currency coupons required by the public, so that they can be widely and fully circulated in the market, and then our company's tram price coupons can be recovered within a time limit. In addition, all sectors are eagerly awaiting the issuance of the Central Bank's second batch of 500,000 yuan in fractional currency coupons as soon as possible. It is heard that the Central Bank plans to ship them to Shanghai in early November, and they will be issued at that time.</p>
<h3>The Haita Wheel Has Already Set Sail Yesterday Some Passengers Did Not Agree to Refund the Tickets There Was No Way to Refuse and Followed the Wheel to Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Haita Wheel, managed by the Norwegian business Hualun Foreign Company, joined the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It was originally scheduled to go to Ningbo for the second time the day before yesterday. The cargo was full, and more than 700 passenger tickets were sold in advance. Because it was a cargo ship and there was no other cabin equipment, all the tickets sold were for steerage. It was originally scheduled to export at noon on the 25th, but because the cargo was not loaded in time, it was changed to 4:00 PM. Just as it was about to set sail, Hualun Foreign Company suddenly received a notice from the Norwegian Consul that the wheel was not allowed to carry passengers, so it cooperated with the Zhongyi Company, which was the agent of the wheel, and sent personnel to the ship to explain to the passengers, and posted a notice on the side of the ship, asking passengers to exchange tickets for the Deping Wheel or refund their tickets. Therefore, it could not be set, and it was changed to export at midnight on this day. Unexpectedly, some passengers refused to exchange tickets, refused to refund tickets, and refused to leave the ship. Although the crew, company staff, and others tried their best to persuade them, it was all in vain. They sat on the ship, so it was impossible to set sail again the night before, and it was delayed until yesterday morning. The company continued to send Li Zhiyi, Chen Jishan, and seven or eight other people, carrying cash, to the ship to persuade them and handle ticket refunds and other procedures. As a result, only some passengers refunded their tickets and changed tickets to go ashore at that time, while some passengers still lingered and refused to refund or exchange their tickets. By 1:00 PM, it was impossible to proceed. The wheel could not be delayed any longer, so it set sail for Ningbo with some passengers at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Moufu Wheel of the Lihe Foreign Company was full of cargo, and 4,000 passengers also left Shanghai for Zhenhai at about 12:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>It Is Forbidden for Money Shops and Pawnshops to Mortgage and Pawn Gold Those Who Have Already Been Pledged Are Limited to Exchanging Legal Tender Within One Month The Situation in Shanghai Is Special Hope to Handle It Automatically</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the government's gold reserves, in addition to explicitly banning the private sale of gold last month, and ordering the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural banks to handle the exchange of gold and metal ornaments in various silver shops at legal prices for legal tender at any time, the Chongqing headquarters of the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural banks recently issued a new ordinance on the 22nd of this month, prohibiting the storage and mortgage of gold. The new ordinance prohibits banks and money shops from using gold as loan collateral, and pawnshops from pawning gold. Those who have already stored and mortgaged gold are required to report to the four banks or branches in detail within 30 days, and exchange it for legal tender at the price. Otherwise, all will be confiscated, and a penalty of 50 times the value will be imposed. The branches of the four banks in Shanghai have also followed the instructions of the ministry to handle this matter of collecting gold. It is heard that the procedures for collecting and exchanging gold and silver have been handled by the four banks as usual before and after the war. Now that the ministry has ordered banks, money shops, and pawnshops to report all stored and mortgaged gold to the branches of the four banks in detail and exchange it for legal tender, this is a government order, and the branches of the four banks in Shanghai will of course not be an exception. However, it is hoped that the authorities of the money shops and pawnshops should immediately follow the instructions of the ministry and come to handle the procedures for exchanging gold for legal tender within this time limit. The price will be calculated according to the Central Bank's listed exchange rate, and a handling fee, bonus, and premium will be paid at the same time to encourage them.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Bank Staff to Handle Deposit and Withdrawal Procedures: Fraudulently Obtaining Money and Arrested; Investigation Reveals Four Previous Offenses</h3>
<p>Li Qingyun from Zhenjiang, formerly employed by a certain bank, became idle after being laid off. He conceived a peculiar idea: exploiting his familiarity with banking procedures, he loitered around the inquiry desks of various major banks. If he encountered someone naive intending to deposit or withdraw money, he would impersonate a bank employee and approach them, offering to write deposit slips or handle withdrawals on their behalf, using this opportunity to</p>
<p>defraud them of valuables.</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, at 1:50 PM, Yu A'gen, the owner of Xinglong Restaurant at 46 Huaji Road, took 500 legal tender yuan to the Savings Society of the Four Banks on Hankou Road for deposit. Because Yu could not write, he was inquiring when he happened to meet Li Qingyun. Li stepped forward, impersonating a staff member of the Savings Society, offering to write for him and handle the deposit. Yu handed over the money. Unexpectedly, Li, after counting the money, attempted to flee. Yu discovered this and reported it to the police. Detective Wang Shusheng was dispatched to take Li, along with the original amount, to the General Patrol Station and transferred him to the First Special Court for</p>
<p>detention pending trial.</p>
<p>It is learned that the case is being rescheduled. Detectives discovered that Li had committed three additional cases of fraud and theft: (1) On January 30th of this year, Li, impersonating Wang Shuping, the manager of the Savings Society of the Four Banks, contacted Lei Yunsheng National Pharmacy on North Henan Road by telephone, intending to purchase pearl powder. After initial negotiations, Li went there the next day, stating he wanted to buy three taels of pearl powder at 180 yuan per tael. He asked for it to be delivered by shop assistants. Consequently, shop assistants Weng Shouchen and Sun Changsheng accompanied Li with the pearl powder to the Savings Society of the Four Banks. As it was lunchtime, Li told the two assistants to wait in the reception room while he</p>
<p>went into the manager's office.</p>
<p>Shortly after, he came out, saying the manager needed to see the goods. The two assistants, unsuspecting, handed over the pearl powder, witnessing Li enter the manager's office. Unexpectedly, he did not reappear for a long time. When they pushed the door open, they realized there was a small door leading to the outside. Asking the tea server, they learned they had been tricked and returned to the shop to report it to the police. (2) On August 15th of this year, a merchant from Jiangbei, Fu Yusheng, took a 2,000 yuan check to the Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road for encashment. Unexpectedly, he met Li Qingyun again, who impersonated a staff member, claiming he could simplify the withdrawal process, thereby getting the check cashed and</p>
<p>fleeing with the money.</p>
<p>(3) On July 15th of this year, a woman from Qidong County, Jiangdong, Lan Yicui, brought a passbook to the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road, intending to withdraw 500 yuan. She also met Li Qingyun, who offered to handle the withdrawal on her behalf, and Li absconded with the passbook. After discovering this, she urgently asked the bank to stop payment, but 500 yuan had already been withdrawn. 429 yuan and 92 cents remained, luckily not yet taken. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Li to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit according to the law. As only a</p>
<p>representative from Lei Yunsheng had appeared in court today,</p>
<p>and the others had not arrived, he requested a postponement. Subsequently, Sun Changsheng, an employee of Lei Yunsheng, complained about being deceived and stated that the stolen goods had been recovered in February of this year. At the time, due to the repeated pleas of the defendant's parents, wife, and family, they had not handed him over to the police. When questioned, Li Qingyun confessed to the accusations, admitting the money had been spent. Judge Dai instructed the defendant to be detained and the hearing rescheduled for seven days.</p>
<h3>Lost Children Seeking Claimants</h3>
<p>(1) A girl named Jinmei, five years old, went missing on September 20th at Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The Jing'an Temple Road police reported this to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department. Because the child was young and unable to provide any information, the Protection Section, noting that the child was covered in scabies, sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. The child has now recovered and has been transferred to the Children's Shelter of the Tzu Chi Association, awaiting her family to claim her.</p>
<p>(2) A boy named Zhang Shengda, eleven years old, from Changshu, went missing on October 14th at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. The Old Gate Police Station reported this to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department. According to inquiries, the child came to Shanghai with his mother from the countryside at the beginning of October to make a living. On the 14th, his mother took him shopping on Nanjing Road and told him to wait in front of a certain shop. Unexpectedly, his mother disappeared. It was also stated that the child's paternal grandfather works at the Santong Teahouse in the countryside of Changshu. Therefore, the Protection Section sent a quick letter informing him to come to Shanghai to claim the child. As of October 25th, the child's parents had not yet come to claim him, causing the child great anxiety. Currently, the child is temporarily being sheltered by the Children's Shelter of the Tzu Chi Association. (3) A boy named Xilin, six years old, from Shaoxing, went missing on October 20th at 1:15 PM at the intersection of Tokyo Road and Connaught Road. The Gordon Road Police Station reported this to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department, who transferred him to the Relief Group of the Tzu Chi Association for shelter. According to the investigation, when the boy was sent to the police station, there was a red paper in his pocket, which read: "My son Xilin, from Shaoxing, is six years old this year. His parents are currently unemployed and unable to support him, so they abandon him on the road. We hope kind-hearted people will send him to the police station, saving a life, a great merit." The Tzu Chi Association sincerely hopes that the child's parents can change their minds about abandonment and come to complete the procedures for claiming him. If there is no indication in the near future, they will consult with the Children's Protection Section to allow reliable people to adopt him, ending his relationship with his biological parents.</p>

<h3>Truth Revealed in Apartment Murder Case: Victim Was a Kidnapper; Paternal Uncle Avenged the Murder, Four Suspects Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, around 10:00 PM, the body of an unidentified man, strangled to death, was discovered in the washroom on the second floor of the apartment at 1920 Avenue Joffre. After the incident, the French Police issued orders to Chinese and Western detectives to strictly pursue the culprits and solicit information from the public to solve the case as soon as possible, as reported in this newspaper. Until the night of the 24th, the police, based on the</p>
<p>report of an Ayah</p>
<p>employed by a Westerner in the apartment, detained Qian Jiesheng, a 22-year-old from Haizhou (who worked as a shop assistant for a Westerner at 1908 Avenue Joffre). He was taken to the police station and confessed the truth. The next morning, Zhang Rongshu, the main culprit, a 22-year-old from Siyang (residing at 115 Carter Road, working as a garbage collector), and accomplices Zhao Yuyin (21-year-old from Siyang) and Xu Jixian (21-year-old from Hebei) were apprehended. Yesterday, all four were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, requesting detention for an extended period for</p>
<p>further investigation.</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant Zhang Rongshu confessed that the deceased was named Ding Lezhi, 32 years old this year, from Siyang, Jiangsu. During his lifetime, he was a notorious kidnapper in his hometown, rampant for a time. On July 17th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Ding Lezhi kidnapped several sons of wealthy families, intending to hide them in my house. At the time, my grandfather Zhang Guolun and uncle Zhang Xiaokouzi strongly refused. Ding held a grudge in his heart. The next day, he used a gun to kill my grandfather and uncle. This time, Ding suddenly came to Shanghai and was encountered on the road,</p>
<p>a chance encounter.</p>
<p>He was lured to my home and treated as an honored guest, with great courtesy. The next day, he was lured to the scene of the incident. I begged my friends Zhao Qian and Xu to help, and Ding was strangled to death with a rope. It was entirely to avenge the murder of my ancestors, out of filial piety, with no other motives. I request an investigation, etc. When questioned, the defendants Zhao Yuyin, Qian Jiesheng, and Xu Jixian confessed to helping commit the murder without denial. Judge Miao verified the statements and decided to reschedule the hearing for November 9th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Landlord Repeatedly Fails to Raise Rent, Forcing Tenant to Move Out, Refusing Rent Payment, Court Mediation Fails</h3>
<p>The house at 194 Rue du Consulat, French Concession, is managed by Weikang Estate Agency. Lu Fengbiao, a tin merchant, rents and resides there, with a monthly rent of 126 national currency yuan, paid in advance. A lease agreement was signed between the two parties. However, Zhu Meisun of Weikang Estate Agency, having failed to increase the rent three times, recently filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting</p>
<p>mediation for eviction.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the petition, the court, presided over by Judge Yuan, conducted mediation in the Fourth Civil Court. Zhu Meisun, the petitioner, stated the reasons for requesting the respondent, Lu Fengbiao, to move out, claiming that the respondent owed four months' rent and had built a small house privately. Tang Hao, the lawyer representing the respondent, Lu Fengbiao, stated to the court the reasons for not being able to move out: the respondent has always paid the rent according to the lease agreement. The petitioner is taking advantage of this extraordinary period to</p>
<p>repeatedly demand</p>
<p>rent increases. The respondent has accepted twice, once adding seven yuan and the second time adding fourteen yuan. This summer, the petitioner again attempted to make a third request to increase the rent. The respondent believed that the petitioner was taking an inch and wanting a mile, so he did not accept it. Unexpectedly, the petitioner forcibly demolished a side door of the house. The respondent immediately entrusted this magazine to send a letter to the</p>
<p>petitioner for negotiation,</p>
<p>limiting the petitioner to reinstall the side door within three days, but without result. Subsequently, the petitioner stopped collecting rent. The respondent had prepared sufficient rent and sent a letter urging the petitioner to collect it. Each letter urging the petitioner to collect the rent was sent by registered mail from the post office, with documents as proof. Furthermore, the respondent brought the rent for recent months today, willing to pay it in court. As for the petitioner's claim that the respondent had built a house privately, there is</p>
<p>no basis.</p>
<p>The court then asked the petitioner if he was willing to accept the rent, and the petitioner replied that he did not want the rent and still wanted the respondent to move out. At this point, the court considered that there was no room for mediation and declared that the mediation failed. A lawsuit can be filed separately.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 72.7 and the lowest was 50.9. On the same day last year, the highest was 66.4 and the lowest was 58.5.</p>
<h3>Correcting the Mistake of the "Going to School" Issue</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>Reading Ms. Jie's article "Sending My Son to School" published in this newspaper on the 23rd, it concerns sending her four-year-seven-month-old son to a model elementary school to study in the first grade. As a result, the school's level was exceptionally high and surpassed the Ministry of Education's order. He was demoted for not being able to write a diary, leaving her to sigh that she had nothing to say. This is a national education issue, and we must not take it lightly. The writer has been an elementary school teacher for more than ten years and dares to offer what he knows to correct the mistakes on both sides.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the family side: (A) The age of children entering school (entering the first grade of elementary school) is stipulated by the Ministry's order to be six full years old. Now, Ms. Jie's son is only four years and seven months old, so he is naturally not qualified to enter the first grade and can only attend kindergarten. The writer has a four-year-eight-month-old son who has not even entered kindergarten because there is no formal kindergarten near his residence. If there is, it is a high-end type that costs dozens of gold coins every half year, leaving his father teaching while his son has no books to read, so he can only sigh that he has nothing to say. (B) The Ministry's order does not stipulate that the level of children entering school must be able to write their own names (like my son, whose surname and name have many strokes, making it even more difficult) and recognize Arabic numerals, let alone be able to write a diary (which is simply unreasonable). Because they don't know how to read, they need to enter school. However, some parents think that their children are smart and can recognize hundreds of words before they are four or five years old, so they desperately teach them to read, thinking that it will be easier to enter school. This is also a big mistake. It must be known that children's intelligence is limited. Using their brains too much in this way greatly impairs their intelligence, and they will suffer from sluggish thinking in the future. (C) The purpose of children's education is to pursue knowledge, cultivate morality, and train their bodies, so that they can become sound citizens in the future. However, in Shanghai, because living spaces are small and children are too noisy at home, some people send them to school regardless of age and other factors to "confine them." In fact, schools are not prisons for children. It is not appropriate for fathers, let alone mothers, to abandon their responsibility of educating their children in order to enjoy freedom, play mahjong, and watch operas.</p>
<p>Then, let's talk about the school side: (A) Since the Ministry's order has stipulations on the age of enrollment, the principal of the school should not have allowed Ms. Jie's son to enroll in the first place, and there is no need to demote him later because he cannot write a diary. Just say directly: "Your son is too young, I am afraid it is not suitable for entering the first grade." I think Ms. Jie would definitely have nothing to say. (B) As for the level of enrollment, there is actually no standard at all. In Shanghai, in general, those who run schools often find that at the beginning of the school year, the number of applicants for the first grade is overwhelming, while there are not many transfers to other grades, which inevitably reduces tuition revenue and makes it difficult to allocate teachers. So, they set a special standard that surpasses the Ministry's order to determine who to admit. As a result, the first-year students who are admitted have the level of second-year students, teachers can be lazy and do not have to take on the initial enlightenment work, and the principal can also exaggerate that the level of this school is "indeed a bit deeper." The way to correct this is to set the number of places, regardless of the level. Once the number of applicants reaches the limit, no more will be accepted. And teachers should teach based on the standard of those who have never been to school and do not know a single word, which requires the experience and conscience of the teachers. (C) Teachers are poor, poor in that their hard work is unseen, and poor in that their rewards are meager. But if they think of training a group of young citizens for national education, so that they can become sound citizens in the future, they will get a kind of natural pleasure in their spirit. Then, they should explain to the general public, students, and parents who do not understand education, so that they know the importance of children's education, which is not just to "confine them," or to recognize a few words, or to rely on it for a living in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, the writer thinks that the model elementary school mentioned by Ms. Jie, which not only requires first-year students to be able to write diaries, but also requires fifth- and sixth-year students to read classical Chinese, is really unreasonable. It is a model in an inexplicable and absurd way. As for the intention of this article, it is not only aimed at Ms. Jie and the model elementary school, please do not misunderstand.</p>
<h3>Hiring a Private Tutor Scam</h3>
<p>— Ironclad Proof</p>
<p>"There's nothing you can't find in Shanghai," that's so true. Indeed, the number of scams, the ingenuity of the plans, and the smoothness of the methods are truly unbelievable. Now, I will report the following incident that I personally experienced:</p>
<p>If you want to earn some money in your spare time, besides writing, then being a private tutor is the most ideal occupation that we poor students generally hope for.</p>
<p>There are so many unemployed people that finding a job is indeed more difficult than ascending to the blue sky. Although I have asked my relatives, friends, and teachers to help me find a position as a private tutor in many ways (naturally, I have also posted in the social services column of the newspaper), what they bring back are always batches of rebuffs and disappointing news.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I happened to see an advertisement in the newspaper for hiring a private tutor. The monthly salary was twenty yuan, and I only had to teach English for one hour a day, and there were only two junior high school students. So, with an excited and pounding heart, I visited the address in the newspaper.</p>
<p>It was an imposing mansion, a small Western-style house, located in a very quiet and peaceful place. After I handed over my business card and explained my purpose, the person who came out to greet me was a middle-aged man in his forties, wearing a smart suit and very polite.</p>
<p>The conversation began.</p>
<p>"Sir, do you originally have a job?"</p>
<p>"No, I am studying."</p>
<p>"What school?"</p>
<p>"×× University."</p>
<p>"What department?"</p>
<p>"×× Department."</p>
<p>"Oh! Excellent, excellent!" After a pause, "Do you have any teaching experience?"</p>
<p>"I have also worked as a private tutor before."</p>
<p>"Oh! Then teaching English to two junior high school students is not a problem." Then, "What English classics do you read?"</p>
<p>So, I recited a series of them.</p>
<p>"Then let's talk in English for a while."</p>
<p>Naturally, he wanted to test my level. Indeed, conversation is the easiest and most accurate way to test a person's English level.</p>
<p>After the conversation, he immediately said a lot of compliments and praises. Then, he asked me many irrelevant questions like a judge interrogating a prisoner.</p>
<p>Finally, it was decided that he would decide whether to hire me after a week of trial teaching, and that there would be a travel allowance during the trial teaching period.</p>
<p>Although this was a very harsh requirement, I finally endured and accepted it. And I even thought so naively: Trial teaching is necessary, so as not to take the money and mislead people's studies.</p>
<p>In this way, I went to teach the two junior high school students English at the specified time every day. Naturally, I taught very seriously, not sloppy or perfunctory at all. I admit that I did my best.</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the seventh day, I received a letter from the other party, which said in essence: The child is sick, so I should not go for the time being, and I will be notified after he recovers. So, I waited every day for the news of the child's recovery.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met my old friend Shen (who studied in the Foreign Literature Department of a certain church university and whose English level is indeed good, as we were classmates in middle school), who revealed the truth about this scam.</p>
<p>Similarly, Shen's application was also after seeing the news in the newspaper about hiring a private tutor. Poor thing, he was also only there for six days, and then the same letter shattered his dream of being a private tutor and the illusion and longing for twenty yuan. Recalling what the child said on the first day of class: "Sir! My father is really strict. He always changes teachers every week, saying that the teacher doesn't teach well... You are already the third one." At first, I thought it was a threat and intimidation, but now it powerfully confirms such a scam: Without spending a penny, he first posts an advertisement for hiring a private tutor in the social services column of the newspaper, and then selects from the applicants (he may have a selective meaning in testing the level) those with a better level to let them teach for a week, and then uses the excuse that the child is sick to put the problem aside and complete his clever scam. At the same time, his child enjoys a week of free special tutors.</p>
<p>Although I lost some time, energy, and travel expenses, I gained valuable lessons that cannot be bought.</p>
<p>Finally, I advise those who apply to be private tutors not to repeat the same mistake. If they want you to trial teach, it can only be limited to one hour. At the same time, I hope that gentleman will not do such unconscionable things again. If you do that trick again in the newspaper, then your name may be found in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Rain After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Bao Xiaotian</p>
<p>He Shuangyu said: "So that's how it is! Why is there the scent of sweet osmanthus? Is it a unique specialty of Changshu?" Zhu Airen said: "No! As far as I know, there are several places in the south that were formerly famous for sweet osmanthus and chestnuts. But now there are more, so it's really not unusual. When we were little, we only knew that Hangzhou had sweet osmanthus chestnuts, Wuxi had sweet osmanthus chestnuts, and then Changshu had sweet osmanthus chestnuts. In Hangzhou, it's at Manjuelong. That place is entirely planted with sweet osmanthus. In the autumn, many tourists go to appreciate the osmanthus and often bring back several woven bags of chestnuts. Because the villagers of Manjuelong plant osmanthus and also grow chestnuts, the chestnut trees are mixed among the osmanthus groves, so they naturally absorb the fragrance. The sweet osmanthus chestnuts of Wuxi are most famous in the area of the Wa Huang Temple. Actually, fruit trees are often grafted, and they often produce very good fruits. For example, if apples and pears are grafted, they will produce a very sweet and crispy apple-pear. If roses and grapes are grafted, they will produce rose grapes with a rose fragrance. There are already many kinds of fruits like these being produced, so there are many kinds of fruits that didn't exist before, but have only appeared recently. Those are all new inventions of horticultural fruit growers. In terms of gustatory delights alone, modern people have a much better deal than ancient people! Because of the matter of grafting fruit trees, some people who study ethnology and eugenics have put forward a theory, saying that the children born from the marriage of people of two races are bound to be excellent. Some people also say: That's not reliable, pure blood is still better after all. But judging from the facts, recently there have been many marriages between our yellow race and the white race, and the children born are indeed mostly excellent. And in recent years, there are more and more Chinese people marrying Europeans and Americans every day." He Liyu said: "To talk about world harmony, we must first eliminate that narrow racial prejudice. Many wars, with killing filling the fields and brains and blood splattering the ground, are all caused by racial prejudice. People think their own race is the noblest in the world, while other people's races are the most humble. I remember more than ten years ago, in continental Europe, the Jews were expelled, leaving them with nowhere to go. It seemed as if there was no place for Jews to live on such a large earth. Isn't that all because of racial prejudice? This kind of extreme and narrow-mindedness must be eliminated before we can talk about world harmony. Like Sister Airen said, children born from interracial marriages are not inferior. Our stepmother, she is born of yellow and white races, and her intelligence and appearance are in no way inferior to others. Furthermore, our two younger brothers, they also carry the white blood of their maternal grandmother, and they are also very outstanding." (195)</p>

<h3>Global Photographer Stationed in China Goes to Europe to Photograph Newsreels of the European War</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zeng</p>
<p>Americans are naturally fond of innovation and are always at the forefront, especially in the film industry. Howard Vena, a newsreel cameraman stationed in China for Universal Pictures, went to Europe last month to photograph newsreels of the European war. Vena was sent to China in 1934 to film the life and scenery of our country and travel newsreels of various countries in the Far East. Four years ago, when the situation between Italy and Abyssinia was tense, he left China for the Philippines to film the Italo-Ethiopian War. He was seriously injured and returned to his home country for half a year of recuperation before he recovered.</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Vena was ordered to come to China again as Universal's photographer stationed in China. According to him, he had already filmed many newsreels of the Sino-Japanese War and was about to organize them when he suddenly received a telegram from Universal urging him to go to Europe. He had to stop all his current work and leave China in a hurry. He hopes to finish his work in Europe and return to the United States to reunite with his beloved wife and young son, and then come to China again. He also said that when he first came to China, his impression was not good, but after coming to China for the second time, observing with a photographer's eye, his impression was the opposite and very good. He is one of the young newsreel cameramen in the United States. He is 28 years old and has been a newsreel cameraman since he was 17. He has nine years of experience, so Universal ordered him to go to Europe to take on this most difficult job.</p>
<h3>Talking About Cheng Yanqiu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Guo Duo</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's Acting: The word "acting" includes facial expressions, body movements, stage steps, running the stage, water sleeves, and various movements of sitting on cushions. Speaking of facial expressions, it is closely related to appearance and temperament. Cheng Yanqiu's appearance is dignified and elegant, so his expressions are not frivolous, but he excels at performing tragedies. Also, because he is quiet and rich in emotion, his performance of tragedies is more moving and touching than anyone else; in places of sorrow and melancholy, his furrowed brows evoke endless pity; every move he makes is exceptionally dignified, so he is most able to portray virtuous women and martyrs with great care, touching people's hearts.</p>
<p>Speaking of body movements, it is also related to innate physique. Cheng Yanqiu's height is originally taller than other actors; in recent years, he has become even more plump. Being both tall and plump makes body movements difficult to please, but Cheng Yanqiu can slightly bend his legs to suppress his height and wear loose-fitting clothes to conceal his plumpness, so that during performances, he not only does not appear undignified, but feels even more graceful and blessed.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's water sleeve skills are ethereal and unrestrained, and running the stage is swift and unparalleled, both of which have reached a state of perfection. As for his stage steps, they are light and natural; sitting on cushions is quick and clean; all are superb skills that cannot be learned overnight.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's Private Morality: Cheng Yanqiu not only achieved success in singing and acting, but also his private morality is worth discussing: First, Cheng Yanqiu always maintains a humble attitude towards worldly affairs. Because he is humble, he can strive for perfection and constantly create art. The most taboo for people engaged in art is arrogance. It is said that Shang Xiaoyun committed this problem. Second, Cheng Yanqiu is full of affection and righteousness. In the past, Luo Yinggong, a famous scholar in the north, greatly promoted Cheng Yanqiu. Later, Yinggong passed away, and his funeral arrangements were bleak. Cheng Yanqiu, out of gratitude, took care of the funeral and wore mourning clothes. This matter has long been spread throughout the Peking opera circles. From this, one can know that Cheng Yanqiu values affection and righteousness.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Finally, I have one thought: I feel that the success of an art cannot be achieved without going through arduous training and patient research. Don't be afraid of difficulties, don't be afraid of insurmountable obstacles, as long as you have determination, are not hypocritical, hold on to your goals, and work diligently, "man can conquer nature," and anything can be achieved. We not only admire Cheng Yanqiu's superb art, but also respect his spirit of being loyal to art.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Regarding the writing motivation of "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," Mr. Wei Ruhui has already stated the necessary reasons for writing this historical drama in "Preface to the Public Performance of Bi Xue Hua" (see "Chun Qiu" on the 25th)—it was written for a purpose. The night before yesterday, this play was also performed at the Xuan Palace Theater. In the three and a half hours, the enthusiastic emotions of hundreds of spectators were a great comfort to all the staff of this play; at the same time, it proved that the selection of "historical drama" material, as long as it is correctly selected by the playwright, to "reflect reality with the mirror of history," is even more welcomed by the smart audience who share the same feelings.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Qing soldiers entered the Pass, and Ma Shiying, Ruan Daxiong, and others surrendered to the barbarians; Zheng Zhilong insisted on territorialism and ruined Zhejiang; and the unyielding spirit of Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and other "Chinese daughters who died for China" were all very similar to the "Chinese resistance at this time and place." Although Zheng Chenggong fled to Taiwan; Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and others were also arrested and executed, this historical lesson is alerting people: Zheng Zhilong, with 800,000 troops, refused to save Zhejiang. He thought that he could live comfortably in Fujian, eating lychees, but when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold, this "hero" who said "being an official is good in the Ming Dynasty, and being an official is also good in the Qing Dynasty" finally reaped his just deserts, and was imprisoned in Nanjing, unable to live or die. The failure of Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and others was also because there were too many "official-minded" people in the Ming Dynasty who only knew about themselves and did not know about the country. But the spirit of Sun Kejian, Ge Nengniang, and others who refused to surrender until death can be passed down forever! In the first act, when Sun Kejian and Yu Danxin asked Ge Nengniang to perform a sword dance, she said: "This is not the place, nor the time!" In the fourth act, when she was captured by Bolo, it was "the time" and "the place." Although she could no longer use the sword as a weapon, she cut off her tongue and spat blood, scolding the bandits to death. Sun Kejian's "My Ming Dynasty has such a female hero, how can I not laugh? Sun San is ascending to heaven today!" This sorrowful and passionate laughter will forever reverberate in our ears!</p>
<p>The arrangement of the four acts is also exquisite and compact. Generally speaking, the third act is relatively poor, because it involves a long process, and it is difficult to take care of everything. However, the typical character of Ma Jinzi is inserted, which not only clarifies the brutality of the Qing soldiers and the people's hatred of the enemy, but also shows that in the autumn of national crisis, regardless of each other, men and women should be loyal to the country, even if it means death.</p>
<p>In the first act, in the brothel in Qinhuai, the relationship between Sun Kejian and Ge Nengniang, Yu Danxin and Li Shiniang, and Cai Ruheng and Wang Weibo is explained, and the Qingliu faction is hated by Ma Shiying. The introduction of the characters and the dialogue are all concise. The climax of the Qing soldiers rushing into Nanjing, and Ge Nengniang's hidden satire of Sun Kejian, tightly grasped the tension and tragic atmosphere in an instant.</p>
<p>The second act, the conflict between Zheng Zhilong and Zheng Chenggong, father and son, should be the most exciting and pleasing act of the play. The division of loyalty and treachery between father and son, mother and son, and uncle and nephew is very clear, and the dialogue is sharp and powerful. As for the section where the singer sings Wang Zhaojun, I think it can be deleted, because she only emphasizes that the merchant women do not know the hatred of the fallen country, and destroying the complete atmosphere of the whole act is not worth the loss.</p>
<p>The fourth act depicts Bolo's lust, and the subtle satire of "shameless" and "dog" is very humorous, but it is even more powerful to incite Mei Niang to stab Cai Ruheng to death; Ge Nengniang scolds the bandits to death; and Sun Kejian calmly dies.</p>
<p>Among the actors: I think Shi Wen, Murong Wan'er, and Tu Guangqi, who played Sun Kejian, Wang Weibo, and Cai Ruheng, are the best. Shi Wen's recitations at the end of the first and fourth acts are passionate and powerful, and his heroic spirit lasts forever. In the fourth act, Murong Wan'er did not know her own decline and wanted to save Ge Nengniang with the sisterhood of Qinhuai, but could not, and could express the mood of a weak woman with a hundred knots of sorrow. Tu Guangqi's "dog thing" is a portrayal of certain characters, making people happy! Tang Ruoqing's Ge Nengniang, the audience who has not seen her for a long time may be seeing her playing such a role for the first time, but the able can do everything, but perhaps after rehearsing for two consecutive nights, her voice is hoarse. Xu Li's Zheng Zhilong, Liu Qiong's Zheng Chengjun, Zhang Zhizhi's Bolo, etc. were also successful.</p>
<h3>New Lineup of Yi Hua</h3>
<p>— Wen Bo</p>
<p>The situation of Yihua Company has been getting better year by year, and its productivity is far better than before. The company's new film lineup after autumn is as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Wang Baochuan is expected to be completed this month (2) Assassin Qin Wang, directed by Yan Youxiang himself, and Lu Ming spent a lot of money to transform his face for this film. This is an extremely tragic historical drama, and is being filmed in a hurry. (3) Burning the Biyun Palace, this film is about the story of the Empress Li giving birth to a son and being murdered, starring Diao Banhua, and will be filmed soon. (4) Biography of Hong Fu, originally named "Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust", directed by Sun Jing. (5) Beauty Trick. (6) Courtesan, the story is extremely erotic and intense, directed by Yan Kejun. (7) Alluring Beauty, directed by Yan Youxiang, is expected to start filming within the year. (8) Guanshiyin, a Buddhist epic, directed by Wen Yimin. (9) Going to Mars, directed by Sun Jing, is a very interesting science comedy.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Gold and Silver Problem in the Ulong Court Play</p>
<p>The value of gold in the Song Dynasty was certainly not as high as the current exchange rate of more than 400 yuan. The silver price was about 100 taels of silver for one tael of gold. (In the past, when coins were used, each yuan was seven qian and two fen. Now, to buy silverware from silver shops using banknotes, it costs about four yuan to buy one tael of silver.) But in any case, the price of gold is always more than ten times higher than silver. When China did not trade with overseas countries, the price of gold must not have fluctuated too much. Let's look at the very clear recitations in the "South Heaven Gate" play, and we can know that gold in the Ming Dynasty was about 14 to 1. The Song Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty were separated by hundreds of years, but the difference between gold and silver must not be too large. Try to see the gold in the early years of the Republic of China, it was only 10 or 20 to 1. From this, we can see the general situation. The words of "South Heaven Gate" are "gold earrings weighing three qian, our gold here is 14 to 1, three pairs of three, three four is one tael and two qian, combined with silver four taels and two qian, plus two hundred big coins." The significance of my specially supplementing this paragraph is to firmly prove that what is stored in Zhao Wen's bag in the "Ulong Court" play is gold and not silver. Even the gold ingot that Liu Tang brought to Song Jiang is similar in size to the fake sycee on the stage. It probably weighs about 20 taels. Let's calculate it according to the value of gold at 14 to 1, wouldn't that be equivalent to 300 taels of silver? This way, Chao Tianwang's stinginess is not revealed, and at the same time, it proves that what I said is "what was taken out later was not the gold ingot that was stuffed into the arms earlier" and is not my arbitrary statement.

<h3>Leisurely Drawing of the Entertainment World (20) Big Drum</h3>
<p>— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan</p>
<p>Big drum is a kind of northern entertainment, performed by beautiful women from Yan and Zhao. The description of drum girls in storytelling includes The Travels of Lao Ts'an in the front and A Comedy of Tears and Laughter in the back.</p>
<p>Liu Baoquan and Bai Yunpeng sing the big drum, and Little Hei Guniang and Yang Lianqin also sing the big drum. The lyrics are all the same.</p>
<p>Dirges such as Crying Ancestral Temple and Drumming and Scolding Cao should be sung by Liu Baoquan and others. As for Big West Chamber and Daiyu Returning to Heaven, they are characterized by lingering tenderness and indirection and are only suitable for Little Hei Guniang and others. But they overlooked this point!</p>
