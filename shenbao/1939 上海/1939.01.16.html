<h3 id="c22">汪精衛之條件 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>在精衛事，原不必再論，顧最近數日，報紙續有紀載，其間尚有難安絨默之點，用更申述之。例如十日重慶電：中央因在之陽電，措辭尚和緩，且無背叛積極行動，故將暫取沉默態度，靜觀其後云。關心大局之讀者，遂以中央與在之間，是吾漸有媾通之道爲問；此一也。又如十四日東京電：在之親信在港語人，謂在仍决心依據下列各條件，與日方作和平談判，（一）堅决反對共產主義，（二）締結中日防共協定，（三）國與德義合作，（四）中日兩國在政治經濟及文化方面，密切合作云。關心大局之讀者，遂以日本與在之間，是吾竟有談判之舉爲問。此二也。又如十四日香港電：汪擬努力獲得中國軍隊及國民黨各領袖之贊助，與日本締結榮譽之和平，其信徒己奉命在港設立辦事處，指導和平運動云。關心大局之讀者既以在之潛力爲問，復以其詭謀爲慮，此三也。更有意識顢頇而志行遊移者，且以爲姑寬其誅伐而坐觀其成敗，容或有蹊徑可循乎？</p>
<p>以我人所知，中央對抗戰，態度强毅，絕非何種說辭何種脅誘所得而搖撼。對汪精衛此次言動，深惡痛絕；但方開除其黨籍解除其職務之後，雖各方紛紛請予以最嚴之懲處，而中央未嘗作進一步之行動者，非對在猶有所期待也。汪若及此回頭，負荆請罪，中央將如何措置，固不可知，然謂中央以綜綰整個國族之尊，而對反覆無常，敗法亂紀之徒，猶有所謂媾通，是則不稱，亦所必無。靜觀於在之陽電之後者，僅以觀其有無積極背叛行動，亦非別有期待也。在而繼續其執迷不悟，倒行逆施，亦不過率領三數嘍囉，在華僑較少之區，度其痴人說夢之生活，以自了其殘年。但觀在電發表之後，東京方面自始迄今，視之夷然；詎謂在之幻滅愈趨愈近，反而取爲談判和平之對手？日本誠在進退維谷之困境，備嘗多行不義，欲罷不能之悲哀；然蛻化而去，自有其傀儡可爲工具，在某非其選也。或稱上海方面既有爲在奔走而日人亦頗與委蛇者，安知非即談和之始，此說根本未必可信，而招搖撞騙原爲政治市塲中之平凡現象；相與委蛇者，終於虛相委蛇而已。即使正在勾結之中，至多亦僅爲傀儡問題，而非和平問題。</p>
<p>惟汪自知孑然「身之不爲人重。於是所謂努力獲得贊助也，領導運動也，種種有氣無力之最後挣扎，在其主觀上自覺必要。雖然，在固無以誘人，抑誰爲所誘？頗聞往年在之在京被狙，乃其舊部懷恨於在之獨自尊榮而捐棄其一羣衆」，始有人焉，憤而出此；前車可鑒，信譽墮地，今更於離黨叛國之餘，復何所恃以爲號召哉！退一步言之，或有聞彼所謂條件，聞彼所謂榮譽之和平，不免怦然心動；不僅遊移兩可而坐觀其成敗，抑且因戰爭而感受一時一身之慘痛，而樂觀厥成者。則試檢視其條件；關於共產與防共者，主義宗信，未可强同；然抗戰大纛下之精誠團結，既發於先天之强烈之民族意識，亦鑒及關係國族百世之利害存亡，蓋超越乎主義者也；即使不慊於共產主義，中國原非共產主義之中國，謂有因不慊共產而甘降敵者乎？關於德義兩國者，中國尚忠恕，故如承認僞滿也，如撒回顧問也，如藐視使節也，中國逆來順受，至於斯極，始得維持原有外交關係；在在中樞之日，尚無以改進德義之成見，而今猶以合作爲對日條件，豈復有絲毫意義？更退一步言之，在之通電，我人曩日雖斥其非，而於所謂撒兵一端，嘗稱之爲最足動聽；獨於在之以此與其他條件相提並論，指摘其荒謬而已；今則如何？皇皇四條件，語不及撤兵；汪精衛思想之支離滅裂，不更多一證矣乎。</p>

<p>惠州通信、此决日軍犯粤、以在大亞灣登陸、而東江又處軍事重要點、於是首當其衝者、爲束江一帶縣市、如惠陽·博羅·淡水·東莞·石龍·以及其附近鄉村、無不慘遭焚刧姦殺種種禍害、茲幸惠博淡水、業先後克復、惟曾經鐵騎蹂躪、精華盡喪、房屋爲墟、難民盈野、偶爾巡視、乃有不忍卒暗之痛、據查單以難民而論、嗷嗷待哺者三十餘萬人、現正由地方政府、進行辦理善後、救濟工作、則由各方慈善家及賑濟團體主持、但因籌款困難、又在戰事期內、一切措施、殊感不易、茲將惠博淡水等處刧後災情，略紀如下，</p>
<p>惠州</p>
<p>惠州城爲軍事上之要地、故該處受災最慘、在失陷前、已迭遭日機轟炸、全城商戶之被炸燬已將及半數、迨淪陷後、復遭日人縱火焚燒、刻下縣城水東街各商店、被焚者達十分之八、府城萬石坊·打石街·各商店、被焚一半、附城鄉村如上下塘厦晒布塲等房舍、盡遭焚燬、通連府城及縣城之東新鐵橋，當日軍撤退時、已施行炸燬、此外惠州城附近鄉村、多遭浩刦、全城現有難民的四千餘人、惠陽商會在中山紀念堂施粥、每日兩决、因人數衆多、糧食接濟、極成問題、刻下難民散居城內各處、收容問題、尚未解决、</p>
<p>博羅</p>
<p>博羅縣城所處地位、與惠州同樣重要、災情慘重、則比惠州尤甚、縣城商店、被焚殆盡商戶十室九空、民房被炸毀者、達半數以上、人民逃散各處、現雖經華軍克復、但人民來歸者絕少、商店復業、更屬絕無僅有、現縣長已回縣主持善後工作、日軍雖退、日機仍不時飛到境內上空窺伺、交通方面、僅惠州與博羅間之木船已恢復來往、附近各區災情、以派尾湖·七女湖·聯安·田牌·義和·新作塘·彪華·橫河·郭石·福田·聯和·水北·等處、最爲慘重、上述各區、的計有難民十三萬至十五萬人之譜、急待救濟、</p>
<p>淡水</p>
<p>淡水市內及附近各鄉村、被焚及被炸之住戶、共七百〇二間、市內及墟外被炸斃人口的百餘名、逃亡飢寒病故者數百人、流離失所無家可歸者的三千人、救濟工作開始之初、因刦後一切物質缺乏、鐵鍋爐灶、及一切用具、均極不便、故每日祗派食米任由難民煮食、惠淡公路沿路兩旁各村鎭災情、至爲慘重、新墟佛山坳·同和·鎮隆·鴨子埗等處、變成一片焦土，商店民居、被焚殆盡、難民之多、不可以數計，數墟猪行街各處被焚房屋、計共五百三十九間、鴨子埗災情、允爲慘重、難民觸目皆是、人數尚在調查中、現首先辦理施粥急賑、並救護病者、被災區域、計平樂南鄉被燬房屋一千餘間、平樂北鄉被燒房屋一百三十餘間、鎭隆鄉四百九十餘間、甲子埗墟的百餘間、鎭隆墟的八十餘間、捕仔墟的三十餘間、聯盛墟的四十餘間、合計的三千間左右、</p>
<p>石龍</p>
<p>華軍收復惠博之後、日軍卽退守增城。石龍、仍圖頑抗、但華軍向前進攻、甚爲勇銳、旋又將增城收復、乃乘勝再向石灘·新塘·雅瑤·石龍·推進、日軍則將省道第二幹錢廣增段之大橋炸毀、冀阻華軍前進、顧華軍游擊隊、已早在日軍後方活動、幷將石龍與增城間之交通截斷、日軍乃不得不退集石龍、截至八日消息、華軍已將石灘·石龍·東北兩面包團、同時東江河及廣九錢之華軍、縣游擊隊、分向石龍並東莞莞城進攻、經已展開激戰、聞莞城日軍僅二百人、城外四周、已在華軍控制中、日軍祗得閉門死守、惟石龍自被日軍侵佔樹、遭受摧殘、極爲慘酷、民衆因日軍凌辱與屠殺、多方設法逃避、致受盡非人生活、極堪痛心、聞死者殆千人以上、房屋被焚炸者、亦達千幢、日軍用票及日紙幣充斥市面、日軍且强逼市民行使、如有稍違、卽遭慘殺、日軍又嗾使歹徒開設烟賭館、以毒害民衆、妓院原有者、亦爲歹徒恢復、幷有日本妓院、秩序異常混亂、日軍及歹徒、公然搶掠、一日數起、商戶之無人看守者、早已被搜刦一空、縱有人看守者、亦惟杜門蜷伏、期免意外橫禍、其情景不獨十分簫條、且焚殺氣息、亦極濃厚、誠羅刹市不啻也、邇因華軍迭克惠博增城、日軍大起恐慌、每强征民衆、在市郊及車站建築防禦工事、惟民衆則亟盼華軍早日克復石龍、俾重睹天日耳、</p>

<h3 id="c62">工部局對職員待遇　發表聲明　所定調整滙兌辦法　並非增加薪金之謂 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>工部局情報室發表公告云、本局董事會最近决定之提高職員待遇辦法、曾引起批評、外間對於此項辦法之效果、顯有誤會、本局所須首先聲明者、此决所定之調整滙兌辦法、並非增加薪金、將來英金與中國國幣之滙價、如跌至國幣一元合英金一先令二便士又八分之三、全部津貼、即行停發、本局之主要各處處長之最高基本薪金、事實上業經稍减、而其最低基本薪金、則經增加少許、</p>
<p>折合英金計算</p>
<p>關於「A」類職員（主要各處處長副處長及其他各處處長的二十人外）之匯兌津貼辦法、並無任何新定之原則、此類職員之薪金之三分之一、在已往多年間、即係折合英金計算、在本局此决决定以前、匯率之最低限制、爲國幣一元合英金十便士半、倘匯價跌至此種比率以下、則該類職員未能享受所應領之滙兌津貼、本局於一九三六年間、准如職員經濟委員會所擬辦法、實行减薪之時、即默示允給此項津貼、對於此層、各董事均以爲然、此决關於匯兌津貼之規定、即以國幣一元合七便士之最低限制、其用意在使本局能於匯價跌至此限度時、重行考量此項問題、計算匯兌津貼、係以前一個月份之平均匯價爲想據、故匯價每漲高一次、津貼數額即减少一次、</p>
<p>新訂原則一項</p>
<p>此次所定辦法、僅含有新訂之原則一項、即各處正副處長所領之匯兌津貼、比其他「A」類職員所領者爲多、倘匯價低於一先令二便士叉八分之三、主要各處處長之薪金全部可領津貼、而各副處長之薪金之三分之二、可領同樣之津貼、是項辦法、似已引起一種誤解、即以爲各該處長及副處長之薪金、已經分別增加一倍及百分之六十六又三分之二、此種觀念、實屬不確、蓋各該職員之基本薪金、並未增加、設在國幣一元合英金八便士之時、各該職員所領薪津與上年十二月份所領者相比較、最多增加百分之六十、匯價如見漲高、增加數額、即行减低、</p>
<p>設置若干位置</p>
<p>本局爲維持行政之標準程度、並爲有聘用听需人員之可能起見、認爲必須設置若干位置、各該人員之薪金，如折合外幣、當與在世界上其他各大城市中担仟同項職務之市政人員所領者、相差無幾、本局所給高級職員之薪金、如折合外幣、而與其他各機關之負有同等責任之職員所領者、或與本埠若干規模較大之商家之職員所領者相比較、並不過高、至於「A」級職員與「B」「L」兩級職員之待遇、向有差別、「B」級職員之薪金、向係按中國之幣計算、此决所定之生活費津貼百分之十五、與外幣匯價、並無任何關係、本局之用意、乃在視生活費用之高低、定期改訂津貼成數、</p>
<p>退職儲金減省</p>
<p>此决所定之人以爲本局所給退職儲金、隨匯兌津貼而增加、但事實上適屬相反、自本年一月一日起、退職儲金反比從前爲少、蓋自一九三七年以來、此項儲金本係以基本薪金與滙兌津貼之併合數額爲根據而計算、但將來則僅以基本薪金爲限據也、</p>

<p>日軍方面自得悉上項消息後、即感惴惴不安、引起絕大恐慌、乃即於前晨十時起沿浦自董家渡·白蓮涇·至塘口附近一帶、宜佈特別戒嚴、並將原有行駛浦南各小輪、一律扣至浦東南碼頭、實施檢查、協記運輸公司之三江丸、前晨由外灘銅人碼頭、駛往龍華、於返滬途中、亦被扣留、由衣黑色制服之日海軍多人、施行檢查旅客、達四小時之久直至下午二時始准各輪開行、至於南黃浦各處對江輪渡、均被封鎖、迄至昨日止、除浦東南碼頭一處、已許通航外、其餘如小東門·董家渡·等處對江輪渡、仍未恢復、</p>
<p>濫放機槍虛張聲勢</p>
<p>日軍因畏懼新到之華方正規軍，施行襲擊除宣佈特別戒嚴、封鎖輪渡、加緊檢查工作外、並於前晚向塘口一帶、濫放機槍、達二小時之久、附近居民、均聞得淸晰槍聲、旋以華軍並無動靜、始告停止、揣其用意、當爲虛張聲勢無疑、日軍之如是自相驚擾、足見其恐慌不安之一斑也、</p>

<p>到期款項</p>
<p>一百萬元有奇、其後因中政府未履行協定中規定之某數項條軟、故迄未償付外債之到期款項、蓋中政府對於英政府所請履行協定中之某數項規定、不予同意也、該發言人答覆中政府是吾贊同此英日協定一問話云、據現象觀之中政府對於英方籲請履行協定中某數項規定之請、似</p>

<p>中國政府、鑒於欲開發內地富源、首宜完成交通建設、今已築叙昆滇緬國際鐵路、運輸材料、改善公路、流暢貨運、新闢水路、充實運輸、舉辦　運、已收成效、擴充航空、以利飛行、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>建築鐵路　以利抗戰</p>
<p>鐵路建設爲抗戰之主要條件，因鐵路爲交通工具中最龐大之工具、其所需用之材料、多來自國外、故必須先有運輸大批鐵路材料之交通工具、然後能言建設、故已先築滇緬·叙昆·兩鐵路、打開國際通衢、溝通川滇經濟、然後再行建築桂黔·川滇·等各省聯絡鐵路、如　滇黔路、自貴陽至昆明·長七百五十公里、　川黔路、自重慶至貴陽、長六百公里、　桂黔路、自貴陽至柳州、長八百公里、　川康路、自成都至康定、長二百公里、　桂越綫、自邑寗至鎭南關、長一百五十公里、</p>
<p>改善公路便利運輸</p>
<p>公路之建設、較鐵路輕易、且多土石工程、而所需國外材料較少、西南各省公路、尙較他省爲發達、戰前通車之路綫、的二萬七千公里、佔全國四分之一、現有路錢、贛滇·川桂·桂閩·湘桂·川湘川滇·桂滇·川鄂·陝康·滇緬·桂越等、以上各綫、均爲國道幹綫、其他省道縣道、不勝枚舉、各省公路、均可互通、以前之土路、今已修理工竣、今奉部令、　添購車輛、增加客貨運載數量、　改善路面、使笨重車輛通行、節省行車耗油料、　增加渡口、建築大橋、　擴充修理廠、儲購自製配件</p>
<p>新闢水路促進合作</p>
<p>沿海各航綫爲日封鎖後、有北洋及長江下游國輪、完全被迫停航、今政府决充分利用內地河道、以利運輸、其主耍之水道、爲長江·西江·湘江·桂江·柳江·沅江·等、　新闢及改良川·湘·粤·桂·等省航綫、以與公路鐵路相輔為用、　儘量將上駛之江輪及小輪拖駁，駛至上流、以充實川江運輸、　貸款添造木船、以充實水運工具、　促進航業合作、以提高水運效能、　設沿江險灘之絞灘站、以策航行之安全、行駛上游之民生公司、已指定輪船四十八艘行駛宜渝、萬涪渝·渝叙嘉·渝合。等綫、</p>
<p>開航國際直達航綫</p>
<p>航空公司爲西南·中國·歐亞·等三家、航綫　中國爲渝蓉·渝昆·港河·渝嘉、　歐亞爲陝港·蓉昆·渝港·陝蓉、　西南爲廣河南·廣河西·廣瓊·廣邕、三大公同共有十二錢、長的八千六百公里、今决增闢溝通港·越·緬·各重耍地點之國際直達航綫·同時添設川·滇·黔·桂·各省之機塲、增加現有各機塲之夜航設備、俾能便利飛行、擴充業務、過去雖有桂林號等飛機不幸事件之發生、但今决不受戰事之影響而中止擴充、</p>
<p>試辦馱運頗收成効</p>
<p>內地未經開發之崇山峻嶺、深淵絕壑等一切障碍、不得不以人力等取而代之、今决舉辦馱運、舉凡人力·畜力·肩興·民船·木筏·等一切固有之原始動力與工具、無不因地制宜、儘量採用、現先在宜賓至昆明一段試辦、計其運費比較公路運輸反爲低廉、而運輸之數量、反可儘量發展、不受現代物質之限制、故非普遍竭力倡辦馱運不可、務使內地各省公路之旁、板車如梭、大道之上、負馱成羣、則嗣後軍給貿遷决可無虞、</p>
<p>電信事業竭力擴充</p>
<p>電信事業與交通事業、休戚相關、所以政府於完成內地交通建設之時、對電話·電報竭力設法擴充、　電報·關於有錢電報方面趕添電報總路、擴充固有單綫關於無綫電方面、籌設無綫電快機通報網、增加國際無錢電報直達電路、並在各邊省重耍都市及毘連各省區、建設小型無綫電台、　電話、决擴充現有話錢、而成西南西北長途電話統系、　接通港·河·仰·三處與內地之無綫電話、俾與海口溝通、　各省中心加設載波電話設備、　擴充各大都市電話、</p>
<h3 id="c66">受日偽增稅影響　米價見漲 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>

<p>— 蒂樂</p>
<p>（四）迎接上海的光復時代</p>
<p>日商的活躍，固已有聲有色，但民族資本的苦鬥精神，也是可歌可泣的。為了要維持工人一生計，挽回國貨命脈，都在和橫神奮鬥。遷入內地的早就動員，搬進租界的也不在少，甚至就在租界邊區，靠着頽牆殘壁，重振旗鼓起來。而盡所有能力，不論資本多少，在租界區內覔屋設廠的，也風起雲湧。</p>
<p>據調查（二）：原有華商紗廠已恢復開工的，有</p>
<p>申新二廠　錠子六三，八八四</p>
<p>九廠　九五，六一六</p>
<p>新裕一廠　二八，〇六〇</p>
<p>二廠　二四，九二〇</p>
<p>鴻章　三〇，九三六</p>
<p>永安三廠　六三·一八〇</p>
<p>統益　七九，七〇〇</p>
<p>勤豐　四，二四〇</p>
<p>大同</p>
<p>合記三三，〇二四</p>
<p>崇信　三四，〇〇〇</p>
<p>統計十一家　四五六，五六〇</p>
<p>此外，最近又新創了不少小規模的紗廠，現已開工，或行將開，</p>
<p>（註）　二十七年九月二十七日申報，印者有英商關係××工的，就有下述</p>
<p>紗線錠（鐘）</p>
<p>各該新廠一致開工後，則上海可有製造國產紗布的紗廠十八家，擁有紗線錠五三四，八七〇鐘。雖與戰前已不能同日而語；而且在整個國策上說：在目前情勢下設於租界，並不合理。可是就孤島中的愛國民衆來說：至少今後有繼續服用國貨的</p>
<p>（註）　二十七年十月二十四日申報經濟專刊吳欣奇「中國戰時之棉業調整」可能。然而：上海的紡織工業，要恢復民族產業史上的光榮，目前已只剩兩條路：</p>
<p>第一：不要賣身求靠，至少不要認賊作父。才不致替上海華商紗廠的名譽丟臉！</p>
<p>第二：唯有迎接政治的軍事的光復，才能超脫了上海目前斯處的罪惡環境，同時也獲得了光復！</p>

<p>大陸報云、長沙湘雅大學在美校董代表赫金斯博士、爲長沙大火之目擊者、近抵上海、昨（十四日）語記者云、長沙於十一月間大火後、今瓦礫已加淸除、返城人民的有七萬至十萬人、救濟計畫、亦在開始中、但長沙人民最悲慘之痛苦、尚未到來、彼等逃出城時、無不</p>
<p>略携銀綫</p>
<p>、且政府亦撥鉅款、暫行維持彼等佳今已告竭、此後之隆冬數月中、彼等或將受最深刻之痛苦、赫氏復談長沙之大火云、余於十一月十二日午後、即大火之前一日、行經長沙、全城所見不滿十二人、是晚余復入長沙、人民紛向四郊逃避、當晚即起大火、人民猶有自睡夢中驚起者、御單薄衣衫、忽忙奔避、大火結果、長沙被焚燬</p>
<p>四分之三</p>
<p>、但被焚而殞生者之稀少，殊令人驚異、故信大多數人民、均於事前會得警告、大火翌日、湘雅醫院僅舁入傷者一人、其人嗜賭、竟至屋頂墜下、將彼擊傷、始悉已生大火、湘雅產業，均在郊外故未波及，赫氏並稱、湘雅並非如外傳之在「城外」、因長沙之城牆、拆已十八年矣、長沙之救濟工作、由當地國際委員會辦理、該會方圖靈可能使人民返長沙、並擬於三日之內、實行下列</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>是夫婦偕老秘訣</p>
<p>新婚之夜，為人生無上快樂之事，然使夫婦雙方均無健康的體魄，則往往發生極大的悽事，使終身蒙其不幸，故一個人從未婚波到結婚，必須時刻小心，在平時衛生上首宜注意者，就始婚前要絕對保持童貞是也。</p>
<p>有許多昧於醫學的靑年，以為婚前守貞為女子獨一的責任，差不多男子無負此義務的必要，這種荒謬的成見，確是造成婚後悲劇的主要原因。</p>
<p>男子在婚前荒淫一時，確較女子於婚前不守婦道為多。自凟可說為男子荒淫的起點，過度之後，精枯腦竭，不單在他的面容上老早生出惱人的皺紋，丟掉了容顏的豐潤，消蝕了體態的健美，而且其生殖機能急避凋零，向早洩，腎虧，神經衰弱的途上邁進，使他將來的生活悲悼無有止期！</p>
<p>有人說：結婚生活有助於健康，他們研究的結果，凡是已經結婚的人，所有生病的次數，和死亡率，都是比那些獨生者和鱞寡者要少得多，但請讀者不要誤解，上節所說的結婚生活是指婚前能保守其童貞者，而於婚後能作有規律的生殖程序而言，如若婚前荒淫，婚後縱慾，則新婚後的健康反更迅速地消失，呈未老先衰現象，且腎部無力，生殖不能，戀愛的熱度亦逐漸降低，壽命短促，因結婚而反送掉種種光明的前途者，大有人在。</p>
<p>身體的健康，為一切事業成功之母，這眞是至理明言，蓋婚後夫婦間的幸福與愛情，也逃不掉此種定例。雖說美滿而幸福的婚姻，全賴有許多成功的因素，如志趣投合，財產充足，性情融合，環境舒適，但精力充沛委實她其中最最重要的因素，因精力充沛之後，在外表上則軀幹壯碩，面色紅潤，在內表上則智慧充足，玲瓏活潑，總而言之，健康的男子，對保護家族和增進夫婦愛的方面也較孱弱為優。固然在事實上男子偶然愛上低能的女子，女子因誤受物質的引誘而愛上喪失健康的男子，不能說沒有，但這些是戀愛的錯誤，並非戀愛的理想，他日一經發覺這錯誤，他們便懊喪了。故與其事後懊喪，不若服以德國睾九精質製劑男用州補體康」以促進新陳代謝，增强生殖機能，凡早洩，腎虧，神經衰弱等症，服後廿四小時即生奇效，新婚後感覺精血兩虧者，一服即愈，保證愛情纏綿，白頭偕老。婦女久婚不育及早衰月經紊亂，可服女用「補體康」。</p>

<p>關於自凟對於身心上的損傷，差不多人盡皆知，但其在神經上與智力上的改變，亦大有惹人注意者，蓋自凟患者庸懦而易燥，富激惹能力，臥床則輾轉不得安眠，晨起則呵欠頻仍，疲倦似過於昨夕，注意力薄弱，且時息頭痛及遺精等症，其人格則變為欺騙，自餒，與懦躬，就其憔悴之形容可窺見其內心之不寗，與體力之枯竭，儀容頹唐，令人見而生厭，雙目無神，外具黯色之環，雙手氷冷，步履則蹣珊而維艱，換言之，即數年或數月前，一精神飽滿，身體壯旺，天眞爛漫之靑年，今一變而為枯稿凄慘，飽受摧殘之寫眞。</p>
<p>欲免自凟，首在使一般靑年盡知其害，消極方面，不使閱邪淫蕩故事小說，注重體育之訓練，使其注意力，集中於體智之樂趣，至於自凟鬬傷後的藥劑補教，財可施以神經衰弱療法，積極服以睪九精質製劑男用「補體康」最為可靠，服後腦力增進，肌肉壯茁，遺精頻繁，則應兼服」耐而斯遺精片」，有當夜止遺之功。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>花柳病中之最難根治者，無過於淋病，故淋病之特效藥發明最遲。蓋此等病毒，甚為纏綿，要想一時病毒肅淸，絕非彼口中鼓吹三天五天可根治之市上成藥，能得奏功。因要求淋病之治愈，必須有其經過之歷程，若謂淋病可以有三天五天就可治愈之內服藥，猶如欲登萬仞之高峯，一步可達也。此種誇大之妄說，雖三尺小童，必不敢輕信也。夫要求一種淋病內服藥之有特殊效果，談何容易。觀夫彼德博士所發明之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，殫竭畢生之心血，窮三十餘年研究始獲發明，非彼淺薄之流，與夫乳臭未乾之豎子，輕言特劑，妄事雌黃，於事實上反得不良反應覇烈作用者，大相刺謬，蓋「克淋儂」是根據現代淋病治療法上最新學理非特異療法而採用特製之蛋白體黃色素混合製成。服之具有使每個細胞發生抗淋噬菌作用，所以對於急慢性淋，特是一般市上所不能奏效的淋毒性攝護腺炎，睪九炎，關節炎，精囊炎，輸精管炎，及婦女淋毒白帶等，服「克淋儂」輕則二三星期，重則四五星期，無不徹底根本解决。故能博得全球醫學家之信仰。試問彼三五天可以治愈白濁之內服藥，果能有此信譽乎？</p>
<h3 id="c120">淋病講座　姚菊巖醫師述診所：寗波路九號四川路口　多發性之淋毒關節炎 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>本症之經過</p>
<p>多發性之淋毒關節炎，其成因有種種，大抵由於患對好動及失治之故。蓋淋菌每因勞動之刺戟，從血液間竄流關節，而附着關節，故息者關節每見紅腫，此外飲酒，房事等，尤易流變此症。所謂多發性關節炎者，以其在炎症流竄各處關節，而大體上言之，則多在各部大關節，例如，兩膝，兩胛，兩肘，及指關節等處，多發炎腫。但亦流竄無定，甲處關節稍愈，乙處關節又起。或同時又併發內心關節炎。如此久而不愈，全身每成瘋癱而殘廢。</p>
<p>前車之龜鑑</p>
<p>過去淋病息者，多因受局部療法，及濫服三五天可以斷根之市上成藥。蓋局部寮法，殺菌力只能及於局部，而不能掃蕩近於遊擊戰之淋菌。至於三五天可愈之藥，更不足恃。蓋無數人已受此兩項療法所失敗，足可為前車之龜鑑也。余由近二十年之臨床實騐及從各方之觀察，以德國靜電及X紋電療法交相為用，一方用德國抗淋血淸以分解膠着之炎症關節。同時內服淋病聖劑「克淋儂」，以撲滅散處關節之淋菌，因而迅速治愈，關節仲展自如診時上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角</p>

<p>痰中帶血。固然可使病家大吃一驚。但亦並非絕對之死症。但亦並不是任意可忽視的。在我們醫家臨症上所經騐的。往往遇到由於肺部微血管出血。檢其原因。並非肺病。而許多人痰中並無血點。而檢痰塊。却佈滿了結核菌。因此余在臨症上。勸告病家。請其絕對攝生。如果是肺病。以一般而論。大概已達二三期了。</p>
<p>余因治療肺病。業已三餘年。而覺近來所出之內服劑。均未達根治之效騐。推其中「補肺拿爾」一藥。確有搜癆補肺之功。因此劑有直接撲滅癆菌。及消痰鎮咳凝血之功。並能解潮熱盜汗。推進食慾之功。各期肺病。均可根治。</p>
<h3 id="c122">英美對日之經濟報復　柏 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>自武漢廣州陷落以後，日本即高唱建立「東亞新秩序」，在佔領區域實行經濟獨佔，排斥第三國利益。在華北實行貿易統制，在華中則藉口私運軍火，航行危險，拒絕第三國船隻航行揚子江。故目前華北日貨已佔進口貨值牛數以上。長江流域之日貨亦自第三位躍居第一位。所謂門戶開放機會均等原則，已根本打破。最近日本更公然聲稱九國公約之舊原則已不適用於新局勢，竟欲片面毀約。在此現狀之下，英美祗有決定退出遠東與否。英國自雅片戰爭以還，在華數十年之慘淡經營，已具根蒂。近年對華貿易，雖見衰退，而投資仍佔第一位。美國投資雖少，而貿易則常居第一位。故英美自不甘　置其以往苦心經營之事業，退出中國市塲。近因抗議之無效，已考慮經濟之報復</p>
<p>經濟制裁之效力</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭，國聯經濟制裁失敗以後，對於經濟制裁之效果，表不懷疑者，頗不乏人。按意阿戰爭，在一九三五年十月初旬爆發，十一月間，國際聯合會開會，決議對意施行經濟制裁，國聯五十八會員國中除意阿兩當事國及奧地利，匈牙利，阿爾巴尼，巴拉圭等國拒絕制裁外，參加制裁者計五十二國制裁辦法為　財政上斷絕往來　貿易上則禁止意貨輸入，禁止軍用品及礦產品金屬品運往意國。自國聯制裁辦法實行以後，意大利亦以抵制參加制栽國貨物進口，為報復手段，並施行金融，貿易，消費等項統制，以為對抗。加以意國為入超國家，近年入超常在二十萬萬里拉以上，對外貿易，以德美為最大。進出口德國均佔第一位，進口佔百分之十七，出口佔百分之十六。美國居第二位。而該兩國情為非會員國，無履行國聯議案之義務，日本及巴西亦然，會員國中之瑞士，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉失等國又藉口昆連意境，有密切之貿易關係，對於制裁辦法聲明保留。各國實行之步驟，既不一致。辦法亦不澈底，如煤汽油始終未禁止輸意，故國聯之制裁辦法，未能使意國停上侵略戰爭。一九三六年六月英國首倡對意撤銷制栽，各國相繼踵之，近世史上經濟制裁一幕，中此告終。</p>
<p>經濟制裁對日之影響</p>
<p>在軍事上日本與意大利之情形不同，意阿戰爭，為時僅半年餘，即告收束，經濟制裁之效力未見，而阿已亡。日本對華用兵一年有半，兩套本錢已盡（松岡洋右謂日本有三套本錢　政府準備金　社會上遊資　民間物力）而戰事結束遙遙無期。平沼組閣，意在强化法西斯統制，征發民問物力，以圖一逞；無如在華已陷泥淖，冉遇外來震撼，必難支撐。</p>
<p>在國際貿易上，日意之情形亦迥然不詞，對日經濟制裁為英美所提倡，而日本對英美之貿易，約佔其全部貿易半數以上。一九三七年日貨運銷英國及美屬地達九萬萬日元，運美貨物，亦達六萬萬元。佔日本出口貿易之一半。同年英國反英屬地貨物，運入日本達十二萬萬元，美貨輸日亦達十二萬七千萬元。佔日本進口實易額三分之二。日本對英美貿易關係如此鉅大，一朝英美施行經濟制裁，其影響之嚴重，概可想見。</p>
<p>就美日寫易貨品方面觀察，日本貨物運銷美國以絲為大宗，年約三萬萬元，棉布次之，年約五千萬元，再次為衣着用品及磁器，陶器等。美貨運日以棉花為最多，年約三萬萬元，煤汽油及金屬品次之，各約一萬萬元，再次為軍械及機器等。自貿易數量言之，美國為出超，日本爲人超，美佔優勢。自貨品性質言之，美國運往日本貨物，多為必需品，如煤汽油，金屬品，機器等均為日本國防上工業上所必需。即棉花一項，因中國產量，尙不敷日本需要，亦為不可或缺之原料。日本運往美國之貨物，則屬消耗品性質。如美國在商業上制裁日本，在國內不致發生惡劣影響，而日本則受重大損失，即如生絲一項，若美國銷路斷絕，日本農村經濟，立受打擊。</p>
<p>英日貿易與美日情形相同，日貨運在英國本部，以海味食品為大宗，年達三千萬元，生絲，棉布次之。英國本部貨物運日以機器，船艇爲大宗，年約二千萬元，金屬品次之。英貨為必需品，日貨為消耗品，日本且居出超地位，故英日貿易，日本最佔優勢。至日本與英國屬地之貿易情形，幾為製成品與原料品之交換性質。如日本每年輸入印度棉花的三萬萬元，而每年棉織品運往印度約二萬萬元。澳洲羊毛，每年運銷日本約一萬萬元，小麥約二千萬元，而日本棉織品運入澳洲午達五千萬元，設英國殖民地對日斷絕貿易往來，則日本之成品缺少市傷，原料缺乏來源，工業為之窒息。</p>
<p>最近日本與英美貿易統計（單位·百萬日元）</p>
<p>英美何以尙不發動經濟制　裁？</p>
<p>日本既資源貧乏，依賴對外貿易，英美之經濟壓力，自為日本之致命打擊，何以英美不採積極行動？在政治上之原因，非本人討論之範圍，在商業上之原因，為一部份商人之阻撓。如印度之棉花，五金業者，澳洲之羊毛小麥商人，美國之棉花，機器，煤汽油等商行，皆以自身之利益關係，反對對日制栽。在英美政府方面又慮相互報復，引起嚴重糾紛，美國畢德鬥謂經濟制裁，可以使侵略者就範。而波拉則謂經濟制裁足以引起戰爭。按經濟制裁是否足以引起戰端，在理論上並無一定之結論，要視實際情形如何，日本在經濟上軍事上能否反抗英美，為問題之關鍵。吾人以為英美果取聯合陣綫，決心遏止日人侵略行為，日本軍閥未必即挺而走險。特英美之畏戰心理，適足以長侵略國之氣焰，而施展其恫嚇之技。去年九月間國聯曾請各會員國個別的對華經濟援助及對日制裁，日本政府發言人即以如果列强改變中立，日本將老慮對於在華外人租界之態度以為恐嚇。按英美之在華利益，大部在上海，據萊來氏（C．F．Remer）之統計，英國在華投資十一萬九千萬美金，上海佔四分之三。美國在華投資一萬九千萬美金，上海佔百分之六十四。此外英美在日本之投資，據英國「王家國際事務研究院一九三七出版之「國際投費問題一之紀戰，美國在日投資，至一九三三年底共達四萬四千萬美金，大部為政府債券，較在華投資的多一倍。英國在日投資，一九三零年佔計為六千三百萬鎊，與在華投資之十一萬萬美金相較，僅合四分之一，但據一九三七年十二月級濟頸聞（Economic　Journal）登載金德萊（Robert　Kindersley）氏之估計，一九三六年底，英國在日本投資為五千三百萬鎊（大部為政府債券）。在中國投資為四千一百萬鎊。是英國對日投資較在華投資為大。與萊來氏之估計結果相反。確實情形仍待考證。要之無論在日在華之投資均處日人勢力之下，英美對日嚴厲的經濟制裁之實行，或存投鼠忌器之心理歟？</p>
<p>英美報復之利害比較</p>
<p>英國在商業上，報復日本所遇之困難，是暫時的，目自英帝國全部經濟上言之，則無寗謂為有利，如紡織業英國向感日貨競爭之痛苦，對日制裁以後，印度之棉花，澳洲之羊毛輸日雖減，而英國棉毛紡業，必見繁榮，則棉毛原料，即可由英國本部消納。美國之棉花亦然，甌戰以前，日本每年輸入國外棉花不過一百萬包，英國達四百萬包，後因日本紡織業盛興，英國衰落，及一九三五年日本輸入外棉增至三百六十萬包，英國減至二百餘萬包。數十年來之世界棉花貿易額，始終在一千二百萬包左右（每包毛重五百磅凈重四七八磅）無大漲落。故美棉銷路仍可回至英國。其他美貨如煤汽油，機器等品均非依賴日本為顧客。至於顧慮所謂日本之報復，則觀於英美對華貸歉款日本之動靜，可知其為未必然之事也。</p>
<h3 id="c123">英日擅處滬海關之經過　綫致平 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>（一）談判之起因</p>
<p>自八一三滬戰發生後，日輸之進出楊樹浦虹口區者，恃其武力，一律拒絕海關檢查；同時日貨乃利用其無稅之便利，大量傾銷於滬市。迨我軍西徹後，不肖商人，與日商朋比為奸，私貨之輸入更湧。二十七年度最初四月中，據日方報吿，日方之連絡船來滬者共十三次，其他船隻共十五次，運來貨物總量五萬四千餘噸。大宗以貨為人造絲，糖，疋頭，黃豆，豆油捲烟紙，海味等項，影響海關稅收，實甚浩大。</p>
<p>戰事以前，滬海關稅收占全國首位，暢旺時每月達二千萬元，斯時竟降至每月約四百萬元，以海關稅收為担保之各項外債執券人，至此自不無惴惴。以利為義之外國瓷產階級，原無所謂正義觀念，日人乃以恢復海關權為餌，誘致英人與其舉行談判，要挾滬海關接受僞組織所訂之新稅率。</p>
<p>談判自二十七年二月起即巳開始，由駐日英大使與日外决進行交涉，最初尙偷偷摸摸，深慮外界聞知，至五月談判結束，竟宣布新稅率自六月一日起正式實行，於是此一齣非法私相授受之活劇，於焉告成。</p>
<p>（二）協定之內容</p>
<p>五月三日，英日雙方，同時公佈關於上海海開談制之公報，文甚簡略，只規定斯後上海海關稅收，除撥付外債本息外，部款改存橫濱正金銀行，他無述及。推隨協定成立後事實上所表現者，為南京組織竟委派偽員為滬關監督，滬東區海關緝私工作雖恢復，但所派關員均限日籍或西籍人員。允堪注意者，為新稅則之實行，免除海關附加稅，另搬賑災附加稅，仍為百分之五。進口貨之減稅者，計有棉布，棉紗，棍花，棉織品，毛織品，人造絲，海產，搪，汽油，水泥，雜貨等項，對於日貨輸入，更加有利。此外禹口貨中，綿不鑛產二項，係製造軍火原料，竟得全部免稅焉。</p>
<p>茲錄載英日對於上海海關談制之公報原文如下：</p>
<p>『本年（一九三八年）二尼起，駐日英大使與日外次，即進行關於償還以中國關稅為抵各外債興其他連帶事件之非正式談判，因交換意見之結果，日政府已將其所擬戰時調整此事之暫時辦法通知英政府，英政府於復文中向日本聲明，英國對此戰時暫行辦法之施行無所反對，並聞美法二國亦不擬提出任何反對，如經濟狀况發生驟變，則此辦法得重行考慮之，凡在日軍佔領區內各口岸海關所收入之稅項，概將存於橫濱正金銀行由此存款內將應償外債之額撥交總稅務司，以完全股行以關稅為抵的外債與賠款之義務，此項外債與賠款之償付，須視為關稅於扣除海關行政經費及若干海關支付與津貼後之第一項開支，每一口岸應付外債之額，每月照攤該口岸在上月各口岸稅收總數中所占之成數而決定之，滙豐銀行去年九月起，所存日本應得之庚子賠款將設法付與日政府，此外並將設法以履行庚子賠款與一九一三年善後借飲中日本所應得部份之將來償付，並付還本年一月統，總稅務司在上海滙豐銀行所積存之上海抵付外債項下透支之數，及將日軍佔領下各口岸匯豐銀行關稅項下之餘數，移交橫濱正金銀行，為以將來抵付外債。』</p>
<p>（三）各方對此之反響</p>
<p>A。海關華負一度怠工　上海海關全體華月，於聞悉僞組織任命僞員爲並關監督後羣情憤激，於五月七日晨實行怠工，並舉行全體會議，議決界項：　請稅務司羅福德及華副稅務司裘其偉到傷說明經過。　推代表成立上海海關華員護關會，以你護海關主廉完整為宗旨。　推派執行委員三十五人組織執委會。　電中央說明目前環境，以海工情形，並請孔部長明示辦按。　未得切實辦洗前，堅决實行怠工。</p>
<p>五項議決通過炎，高級關員認為事態重大，乃出席致訓，竭力勸導，認海關係政府機關，關係航商頗鉅，在海關服務人員未獲政府命令，不得擅離職守，況外傳種種，均非事實，？）不應有所舉動，免致各方遭受影響，而為他人藉口云云。</p>
<p>風潮發生時，又有關員被綁架事，旋經交涉釋出，亦有調派至夸海關服務，一傷波浪，於是遂告無事矣。</p>
<p>B我政府之抗議　海海談判協定消息傳出恢，我駐英大使首病英政府提川二點，加以反對。　英國承認日本支記華北八口岸之關稅。　協定中未有償還內債之規定。及協定公報露佈伐，我政府又以牒文送交英外部，聲明中國絕不受英日所訂辦伕之束縛，保留中國在其海關事件上行動之完全樣利興自由，並指斥兩個外國未得中國同意擅自對於中國海關締結協定之舉動。</p>
<p>（四）協定成立後之情形</p>
<p>A日貨輸入躍鱟首位鐵戰事發生以來，對外貿易，甚受影響，自後父逐漸恢復。以上海一埠而論，二十七年度六月份日貨輸入只值二十萬元，卑不足道，七月份躍至四百餘萬元，八月份為二百餘萬元，九月份為四百餘萬元，十月份為五百餘萬元，躍登輸入首位矣。至在虹口出入之貨物，是否全行完稅，尙是疑問。</p>
<p>再就全國結論，輸入貨物，一月份美國第一，為一一，五六九一元，日本第八，為二，四盼〇元，二月份美織第一，為一八，〇二叫元，日本第五，為六，〇二三元；三月份德國第一，為一九，○一儿二元，日本第五，為一〇，二二七元；叫月份美國第一，為一三，二叫五元，日本第二，為一〇，二興〇元；五月份日本第一，為一五，三六一元；六月份黑本第一，為一八，三七二元；七月份日本第一，為一九，七〇一元；八月份日本第一，為二三，八二五元，九月份日本第一，為二四，七五五元；十月份日本第一，為二〇，工二五元（以上單位千元）。</p>
<p>B職貨入口仍然充斥　自海關協定絞穴後，私貨偷淚，本可望其城少，然據報戰，呢絨，嗶嘰，人造絲，豆餅，火柴，嚴魚罐頭日用品等項，仍大量私運入口，欠不納關稅，售價常較市價減三分之一以上，正當商業頗受影響云云。父據十月八日報載，江海關雖恢復滬東翼緝默工作，但常受軍事性質之阻撓，股米能嚴懺執行，走私漏稅之風，迄仍猖獗，絞近同星期內私貨進口以食米，白糖，鹽等日用食品為大宗，深望各界商號，勿進來屨不明之貨云云。綜上所述，可知私貨人此，仍極充斥也。</p>
<p>C海鵑被迫懸掛嚷幟協定談判期間，懸幟問題為一大癥結，關係方面曾一度表示海關此後將不懸掛憬何旗幟為一秋消極啊折衷辦法。乃至十一月四日，據云係受偽組織偽員之命令，五色旗廢幟，竟高懸於江海關大復縱頂，及巡行黃浦江內之各海關船隻上，見者側目，輿論譁然，紛向海關負責當局質詢。期後廢幟又數度懸掛，據總稅務司梅樂和向外界表示，對懸掛廢幟，未接報告，（？）及已向中央方而是報請示云。</p>
<p>（五）與虎謀皮之失敗</p>
<p>關於海關恊定，有以為係戰時期一種不論，對此表示扼腕，及申言中國將保留字樣行動權外，他少論列。然有應注意這。協定成立之後動機固爲防私，而後走私如故，　未稍在華商業利益之壓迫，而無如長江開放仍然拒絕，在華利益階以處處忍讓，轉敗人之輕侮，而損害更爸，此共二；關收除撥付外債與賠款外所餘甚鉅，存放於正金銀行，不無責敵以糧，為日偽雙方所利用，外報記翁曾於鵝日叩間日方發言人「維新政府」曾由雜稅項下提款或借用款項，而以關稅為抵，日方亦避不作答。此共三。抑有進者，外債之償付，所以維待我對外信用，但自津滬夸三關相機淪陷，其權已不在我。外報記者亦以此詢諸禹方發言人，有無將存於正金銀行之鱗餘胤，於以關稅作抵之外債，日人只以調查相推託。凡此當為英人始料所不及。然而事變之來，對於日商亦作萬分之讓步，滬海關允日本郵船會社之請，得用日文提貨單，並填發日文貨目單，此種增例，以一國之海關提單，准用洋文，原非正常，而乃英甭各國文字紛然雜作，此則更匪伊所思。重現實無遠謀之英政治家，與虎謀皮能望其遠東利益之能保持乎，伺況仍在晤中作專實上之承認，互相勾結，將來其權利之損失，尙不止此，英國數百年養成之遠東戚望，而竟剝奪於其當時同盟之日本之手，奪不可嘆。</p>

<h3 id="c133">「是」 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>「是」是中國官傷中一向的精神。上司對下屬脫話時，不管對不對，下屬總是答應道：「是。」前淸這種精神發揮得最為十足，只要坐在自己上面的人一開口，便趕緊把「是」字放川來。命令你辦事，自然得「是」：咩你去做賊，也得「是」：蒼至罵你是狗養的，一樣得「是」。要不這樣，那你便不懂「禮」，是一個最混蛋的人了。</p>
<p>可惜我們沒有果戊理一類的作家，那種現象不曾被淋漓地描寫出來。——其實那倒並不僅僅還文學上的材料而已，在那中問，就是說那不知數的「是」的中問，實在同時也埋著我們過去的內政史和外交史。</p>
<p>我們只要有機會翻一翻過去的案巷，不管是甚麼獄，所錄的犯人底森供，大半總是把審官底話複述一還，最後加上兩個字道：「是實」。但那大半也是「夾訊」出來的，不過總之是要你說一個「是」。由這樣的然歡饑養達冰的人材去辦外夜，挪作風自縈迪汗侖萍樣的。從前的總理衙門，便是向洋大人說州是」的地方：只要洋大人一進咫，發一雄或，那股外交大員便「是騙「是」「是」。結果呢，—不用說了。「弱國無外交」，弱國只有「是」。</p>
<p>這說的只是前淸。入了民國，「是」是應該「革」掉的了，然而卻又不然。官場中到底怎樣，我不大淸楚，攘說口頭上確是再沒有那樣的肉麻了。不遜魷外交上說，從「二十一條」算起，一串的事件，依然是在對外說看「是」。統內政上說，從「三一八」算起，一串的事伴，依然要民眾說一個「是」。軍人身上的槍，見了外國軍隊便取不下來，意思是我們底紀律是「是」。警察手中的槍，見了請願學生便會放出去，意思是你們底紀律是「是」。總之嘴上的黔是騙或者是喊少了，而實際上還是直接和間接在發揮著「是」的精神的。</p>
<p>自然也有「反勁」。太平天國，便是不肯說「是」的：義和團，也是不肯說「是」的。這依然說的是前淸。可是我們能有民國，其實也就是由於不肯說過去的那個「是」。「五四」和「五卅」，也一樣是不肯說「是」的運動。</p>
<p>要堅抉地不肯說「是」，我們纔可以挺起膜來。然而在目前不肯說「是」的抗戰中間，卻竟然有人「是」起來了。那便是在精衛先生底一通艷閏：「親善」，「是」。「反共」，「是」。「經濟合作」，「是」。——「是」「是」「是」，我們又像是走到前淸的外交大員底面前了。</p>
<p>真是這樣的嗎？我想歷史總該不會倒退的。</p>

<p>夜靜悄悄的，兵亂後，狗也死光了，夜行人沒有一點騷擾，跳礙河洪。洪裹的水，採上一層薄冰。偶然一個弟兄，腳踏七去，格執聲響，冰砟成幾塊。嗤！不知誰笑了起來，但立刻給隊長一個雌重警告抑土了。</p>
<p>「我們在在襲，推也不許小聲！」</p>
<p>大地，貍在黑晤裹。十二貝風，掠過叢林，禿幹，刷拉拉打戰，條忽如幽難。一陣冷室氣，吹上每個人鼻尖；鼻尖凍悲；凍蒼紅了。</p>
<p>冷嗎？</p>
<p>復仇的光，閃亮在眸子上。火熱的心，火然的軀體，夜行人是溫暖的，愉快的。</p>

<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>凝神是我最愛的。在空的時候，我總是開了窗，對蒼天斑神，讓腦申浮映陣陣的回憶，像夢一樣縱，像搪十樣甜，</p>
<p>記得，伯父在世的時候，她是偭黃烏的老手。家裹的廳上，掛滿了各色各樣的鳥籠。裹面全楚紅，白，甚至奇異怪罕卹顏色的小烏，嘰嘰怪怪地，一天時到晚。伯父每天的淡作，就是喂食，放烏，洗籠。愛玩耍的我，對這種工作、覺得有相當的興趣，於是，漸漸的我和烏類發生了好感。</p>
<p>一天，我在庭園一發喂鸚，忽然，一隻小麻雀在偷吃喂母鸚的米。一們不防餾，小麻雀被我捉住了。那時我眞大喜過望，急忙給伯父鑑賞。但是，他只說了旬。</p>
<p>「麻雀不能麥，到明天就要死。」</p>
<p>我不能懂得巡奧妙的論話：他自己養了許多小烏，難道不死，嬌偏偏詛咒我費了九牛二虎之力，才捉得的小麻雀！</p>
<p>我倫偷地把那隻麻雀，放在室饑裹，掛在廚房的樑上，不給伯父曉得。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，我抱蓿一股熱望，滿想藐到一點吱嘰聲。結果，一堆血漬裹，偃臥簷那小動物，亳無生氣地，冷冰冰地結束了牠的一條小生命。我驚奇的哭了，我不忍看道救駭人的景歟。但泛，我仍舊不能明白這深切的道理：「麻雀是不能養的。」</p>
<p>到了少年時代，我看見數萬萬的人類為了自己的自由，而和惡魔抗爭，我才領會了「不自由，母奪死」的偉大的口號。我那竇年時代，麻雀的故事，疋他一個很好的證鵝。</p>
<p>現在，我對著數千里外英勇的戰士，為了祖國的寫山解放，向敵人放若正義的皰火，我美系羞，同詩，我慚饑惹，因為我格外懂得自由的意義了</p>
<p>誰還愿意做宛中烏無偷生呢？</p>

<p>基於這種認識，我們就必需以現實生活事件做寫作的題村，把視綾從自我擴展開去，展望一下遼闊的叫局。現實是多極多變的，正多若可寫的素材，只要把生活的視野放大，決不會感到材料的貧乏。</p>

<p>— 梅花舘主</p>
<p>梅蘭芳於民國五年來滬時，携其新鞠古裝劇一黛玉葬化」一齣以相號召，每一貼演，座必爲滿，口碑之盛，較嫦娥奔月爲更甚。山陰　戡道人，爲捧梅健將，對於畹華露演葬花一劇，備至獎許，譽爲不朽之作。當畹華露演葬花之日，道人特爲之編印專刋一種，名曰「梅蘭芳黛玉葬花曲本」，害印一萬册，郎在劇院內公開贈送，此實爲歌壇印送特刊之濫觴。曲本編制甚佳，用連史紙小楷石印，大小與現時北平戲曲專校所發行之「戲劇月刊」相似。茲將羣戡所撰葬花戲考一文，錄刊於下：藉以見畹華此劇之結搆，及全劇演出之程序；並可使後學者資爲觀摩，而得他山攻錯之助焉</p>
<p>「梅郞此劇，穿插極好，詞句皆本紅樓，並無杜撰，以黛玉唱白爲最多。唱分五段：一黛玉出塲引；二掃花唱西皮慢板；三葬花唱二六板：四歸途唱搖板；五艷曲警芳心唱反二簧；均極臻唱工台容之妙，其妙詞通戲語一折，純用做工道白出之，傳情之處，體會無遺，非筆墨所可形容也。</p>
<p>全劇祗五人，分四塲：第一塲開幕，以丑角狀茗燜上，述寳玉嬌養名貴，及購書原尾，內轉下。第二塲賈寳玉，每演皆姜妙香狀之，作公子裝，冠紫金冠，着淺霞色衣加帔，戴金鎖項圈，並佩寳玉，穿襪着鞋，居然怡紅公子也。念引道白畢，作寂寞難遺狀，茗烟進書，寳玉作觀書介，觀畢挾書下。第三塲即黛玉上塲，梅郞狀之，服古裝，惟上塲時，外長衫作蔚藍色，當其　然而出也，觀者神王，恍疑仙子飛來，擊卿都活，首段總白念畢，喚婢紫娟上，紫娟以姚玉芙狀之，亦能彷彿，無怪乎愛畹華者亦愛玉芙也。紫娟取鋤上，爲黛玉脫外衣，捲簾畢即下，黛玉隨做觀燕掃花葬花各折，此塲甚長，由黛玉上念引起唱西皮慢板及二六板兩段始下。第四塲襲人上，入園尋寳玉，襲人以諸茹香狀之，尚無疵，嘗以陳桐雲狀之，則舉措不類矣。襲下紫娟上，持衣入園尋黛一轉下。第五塲即妙詞通戲語，及艷曲警芳心折矣。寳玉先上觀書落紅放花戲謔各做工，妙香亦能體會。此塲上半塲純係道白做工戲，迨襲人請寳玉去後，紫娟上爲黛玉加外衣，携鋤囊下，歸途閒曲警芳心反調，悲凉婉淑，尤不失　卿身分，紫娟再上扶歸唱尾聲，更覺凄楚，故觀者皆留耳，三日不絕，而內幕唱牡丹亭崑曲及反調，胡琴均空前無兩，是以此劇咸稱爲絕唱云。</p>

<p>— 琴</p>
<p>一月八日晚上，我在廣東路上（從四川路走到航運俱樂部）看見路旁石階上，睡着許多難民，數數共有十二人之多。</p>
<p>這十二個難民，分睡在五處石階上：</p>
<p>一處有一個生病的，身上只穿兩件單衣服，蓋着一條稻草墊。常時寒風正呼呼的吹着。這位生病的難民，凍得哀哀的哭泣。</p>
<p>一處有一個老太婆，一個老頭兒，和一個靑年，默默地坐在草墊上。我問了之後，知道靑年是老太婆的鄰居，老頭兒是她的叔叔。老太婆的丈夫，在兩星　前，就在那個病人睡的石階上患痢疾死了。</p>
<p>一處有兩夫妻和一個碼頭小工。他們睡的石階上，只有一條稻草墊，一條單被。</p>
<p>一處有一個中年男子。他所睡的石階上，旣沒有破衣服，又沒有草墊，只好縮着頭，抱着胸，獨自坐在石階上。據說，天天晚上是這樣過的。</p>
<p>一處有四個十四五歲的小孩子，睡在一條草墊上，蓋着一條棉花絮。</p>
<p>寒風越吹越緊，十二偭街頭難民，都冷得瑟瑟發抖。當天雞上，我就和慈聯會收容所主任，親自送他們到收容所裏去。那一個生病的，又送他到醫院裏去。</p>
<p>露宿在街頭的難民，何止這幾個，全市的街頭難民，至少有數千人！這數千人，怎樣渡過這寒冷的冬天？確是一個嚴重的問題。一旦冰雪滿地，恐將有全數凍死的慘事。據工部局衛生處消息，十一月份在邊區路旁收埋的屍體，平均每天有一百十具之多。這個數字，無論誰見了，都要吃驚的吧！</p>
<p>上海眞是一個繁華的地方，據說上海人，每天晚上化在舞塲的，賭塲的，戲塲的，以及茶室酒館的費用要在數十萬元以上。倘能將此費用，每天節省百分之　，便可救活數千個街頭難民生命。</p>
<p>救濟街頸難民，是全上海人應負的責任。如何救濟？我且擬兩條辦法於下：</p>
<p>設立庇寒所　凡能自謀生活，沒有住處的街頭難民，可住在庇寒所裏。庇寒所專供寄宿，不供膳食。</p>
<p>設立收容所　凡無力自謀生活，而又沒有住處的街頭靴民，可住在收容所裹。收容所除供給食宿外，急須兼施民衆敎育。</p>
<p>至於經費方面，只耍上海人熱心贊助，想不致有多大的困難。</p>

<p>話說當明未的時候，廣東東莞」有一位袁崇煥，這位先生，交關聰明，因爲他日常勤讀力學，他曾中了進士。</p>
<p>他當時所硏究的學問是：怎樣爲人民服務？怎樣保持國家疆土完整？他之所以如此，是因爲當時滿人擾亂，明皇不堪其苦，而百姓之塗炭，更爲悽慘！讀書是救國救民爲人類服務的，不是升官發財微虛名的大好老的，他從那時就明白這個道理。</p>
<p>那一天，他坐在書房內，硏究時事，對於滿兵猖狂，大有所感，正是陽春三月的天氣，一樹梨花和幾株稀疏的紫籐，枝枝葉葉把窗子映得非常幽靜，他不禁長嘆一聲：「臥榻之側，豈容他人鼾睡」？說罷便按劍起舞。</p>

<p>不久之後，滿淸和明朝正式開戰了，兩下交鋒，明兵大敗，懷宗十分驚惶，召集羣臣，商量辦法，有人說應該好好的挑選一個良將去把守山海關，大衆都成贊這個意見。</p>
<p>這一提議，正合袁崇煥的胃口，於是他平時所學的現在正是一個實踐的機會。他爲了要明白山海關的形勢，他一個人偷偷的騎了一匹馬，夜裏，浩月當空，</p>
<p>他單獨的向山海關偵察，後來他啟奏懷宗，將山海關的形勢，與守衛的策峪，細說了一遍，那知不說則已，一說起來，懷宗非常驚嘆，大大的佩服崇煥的才能，懷宗說「你眞是一個忠勇的好臣子，山海關給你把守，那眞好極了。」</p>
<p>那時候「十三山」有十餘萬難民，被滿兵圍住不能脫出，崇煥使請求朝廷調遣精兵五千，駐守「寗遠」。因爲「寗遠」距「十三山」近，駐兵在那裏，可以壯「十三山」的形勢，另外他主張再調遣驍勇五千，去救那些被圍的十萬百姓。可惜他的建議被一個淺見的大臣王在晋所阻，沒有實現，結果「十三山一的人民，逃出虎口的，只有六千，數萬條生命斷送於滿人刀槍之下了，可嘆！</p>
<p>崇煥駐守山海關，外修軍備，內撫軍民，成績大好，後來他又奉派駐守「寗遠」。—寗遠這個地方，本來有個祖大壽駐守在那裹，朝廷曾呌他築城防守，他一直不以爲事，他說：「築什麼城呢！早晚還不是落到人家手裏！」，天天敷衍，不肯認眞去做，崇煥到了那裏，便僱用民夫，大興土木，不一年便築成一座雄偉的大城，荒僻的寗遠，竟成爲關外重鎭了。城墻落成的那一天，崇煥仰天宣誓：「我崇煥常與此城共存亡。」</p>
<p>不久之後，崇煥帶着大將又分據了錦州，靑山，松山……等地，開地千里，聲名之喧赫，傳說一時！</p>
<p>但不幸的事情，也接着的到來，朝廷的大臣弄權，嫉視崇煥，妄說錦州不可守，要撤錦州的駐軍，這消息氣得崇煥面色發靑，他忿忿的說「兵法是有進無退的，這是我們心血換來的土地，如果錦州撤兵，寗遠便不能保，寗遠不保，山海關也危險，爲什麽要我撤兵呢」！後來他又說「我袁某是「寗前道」，我在那裏做官，便死在那裏，誓死不撤一兵一卒　。結果，朝廷也無辦法，只從另一方面人手，扔掉幾十萬石米糧，同時又撤去靑山，松山，的守衛，使得全體居民覺到不安，只得扶老携幼逃進關內。</p>
<p>那知淸兵一聽得此消息，以爲機會來了，便立刻率領大軍，西渡遼河向崇煥進攻。</p>
<p>崇煥便召集手下士兵，對他們訓話，並宣誓大家應同心協力，死守寧遠，他拿刀斬去自已的手指，用血在白布上寫個鮮紅的大字—「忠勇愛國」。士兵們見了皆痛哭失聲。大家皆願與滿兵拼死。</p>
<p>滿兵圍城，崇煥出城應戰，因爲軍紀嚴肅，人人抱必死之心，一仗之後，滿兵兀氣大傷，當時懷宗原來聽大臣啟奏以爲寗遠守不住，得此消息，大爲興奮。馬上召崇煥人京，獎勵了一番。</p>
<p>不久，滿兵幾十萬又攻打龍井關，大安口，因爲這些地方駐兵胡塗，遠不及崇煥。所以避實攻盧，一直向那里進攻了。戰端一開，滿兵即不費一矢，便佔了好些地方，浩浩蕩蕩迫殺到遵化而來，懷宗得報，馬上要崇煥出師，崇煥即派趙率敎去援救。</p>
<p>這趙將軍平日是很佩服崇煥的，他受崇煥的影響很深。所以他深明大義，他奉命到遵化左近三屯營札下，滿兵於是一窩蜂的將三屯營圍住。這時他也顧不了許多，憑着一腔忠勇愛國熱誠，殺入滿兵營地，可是滿兵一齊上來，越集越多。殺得趙率敎精疲力盡，他滿望着後營當地的守軍出來應援，那知當地守軍深怕滿兵殺入他們自己的營中，閉門不出，可憐趙率敎兵士犧牲殆盡，最後他仰天長嘆「臣力竭了」！於是拔劍自刎。（未完）</p>

<p>未老先衰與　返老還童術的檢討</p>
<p>用「老」來稱呼人，雖然也有尊重的意思，但這是指他資格的老，或是經騐的老。要是說他年齡的老，他雖已鬚髮蒼白的人，總覺得不快的。這是因爲「老」的隔壁就是「死」，人有好生之性，天有好生之德，誰願意死呢？所以徐福要泛海以求，就是爲得要不死。然由老而死，這是壽數的當然。但許多年齡尙輕，一望而已衰頹不堪，這是什麽緣故呢？據醫家的經騐，人體的所以衰老與生殖腺大有關係。這個人如果生殖腺液充沛，新陳代謝作用必然旺盛，在皮膚，肌肉，筋骨，血液以及內分泌腺等的部分必有　多量的新細胞，則雖年已五十六十以後，皮膚不見皺紋，肌肉豐富而有紅潤的血色，望之仍甚年輕，同時生殖力亦必强盛，雖有年輕的妻子，亦必愛情彌　，家庭和好，或　生育老來之子。這是多麽快樂而幸福呀！這種人必是壽享　　，兒孫繞膝，盡其天倫之歡！假使，男子於早年犯上自凟，繼起遺精，或於婚後荒淫無度，多妻縱慾，致生殖腺液枯竭，新陳代謝作用亦因以衰退，那就面黃肌瘦，未老而已皺紋重重，腦力衰弱，時作神經性之腦脹頭痛，不能思索，記憶薄弱，熟睡時間短促，或竟至失眠，腎虧無能，腰酸背痛，體態龍鐘，則年齡雖尙在中年或壯年，而望之已儼如行將垂斃的老翁了。此種可憐的活死人，不特在精神與肉體上受盡痛苦，學術與事業的前途，亳無希望。即在人生所不可少的傳宗接代之夫婦性生活上。亦每不能如願以償而爲妻痛恨！是以常演出家庭的悲劇，或更子女無出貽終生的大憾！總之未老而先衰者，其命運的悲慘，將尤甚於短命的早殤！但返老還童有術乎？曰，有。這在二十世紀的醫藥界上曾放一異彩。最初有斯丹那氏，奧斐郞氏，却爾摩斯氏等的硏究。尤以斯丹那氏的硏究最有心得而致成功。氏歷三十餘年的艱辛實騐，知人體內的生殖腺液與健康及壽命大有關係，乃將雄壯動物如猿猴猩猩等體中提取的生殖腺素用輸血方法補給於人體，果見犬效。但手術之實施，極爲困難，斷不能普遍的貢獻於大衆，其後復經多數名醫的相助，始將生殖腺素精製成劑名爲「斯丹那氏生殖素」，服後果於二十四小時內即能生精補腎，健腦活血，發揮偉大的效力。雖不能說完全的可以返老還童，使人們的壽命長春不死。但對於治療未老先衰，神經衰弱，諸如上述症象者，確爲最對症而特效。後復由歐美名醫如（Camking　）康克林（Jamst）詹姆士德等氏的繼續化騐秘採用，均斷定爲確具特效，斯時余適亦在美求學，所親見而幷參加實騐者也。及余學成歸國即以此藥介紹於國人，並對於國人之體格是否適宜，屢做臨床實騐，深覺藥性和平效力確切偉大，數年於　　治愈患者不下數萬人云，但　造精者須服「希米脫氏固精片」以　固精關，制止遺洩，則收效更速。惟患者如在本埠能親來本診所施用電療，惟射，手術等各種新法者，更可保證速愈。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>從標準美男子說到</p>
<p>靑年的自凟遺精</p>
<p>愛美是人類的天性，這不但女人要歡喜漂亮，便是我們鬚眉男子，也何獨不想漂亮，不過女人們的歡喜漂亮，她們終脫不了脂粉（講求健康美的女子除外）而我們男子們的漂亮，這除服裝之外，便需要一副好身材。</p>
<p>講到好身材，便不容易，第一要長短適中，第二要骨格亭勻，肌肉堅實，第三要面色紅潤，器宇軒昂，第四要眸子有神，目若朗星，其他精神之健爽，舉止之活潑，思想之靈敏，態度之安詳，固且不必說，便是上面四項吧，試問現社會上，有幾個靑年能夠及格？</p>
<p>我們也不一暴十寒，說現在的靑年怎樣壞，我們也不强自誇讚，說現在的靑年如何好，我們祗知道從事實的觀點來默察一下，覺得現在的靑年，神完氣足，精力健壯，能夠稱得上一聲標準美男子的，實在太少了，而觸目所見的，無非盡是一些患有靑年病的靑年。</p>
<p>何謂靑年病？大槪作者不說，有幾位讀者已經明瞭了，靑年病當然是一種最不好的惡疾！它便是手淫，手淫從健康上說來，眞可稱爲「玩物喪志」，靑年一經沾染以後，最顯著的，便是遺精，精液爲一身養榮之本，假如一任大量的流失，於是面黃肌瘦，腰　背痛，頭重腦脹，思想苦澀，而最使患者難堪的，發育機能受阻，乃有局部短小，睾丸萎縮，腎　無能等各種症象，以這樣萎黃瘦弱的靑年，健康兩字尙然談不到，更何有標準美之可言？</p>
<p>然則此種靑年竟無法挽救嗎？那到不，如果患者抱定意志，認淸目標，一方從速戒絕手淫，從事高尙運動，一方每晚臨睡以冷水摩擦局部，服「希米脫氏固精片」四片以固精關，則遺精當晚可以立止，至於手淫遺精所引起的各種神經衰弱，亦可同時服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以爲培補，則生精强腎，健腦益髓，在短期內必可恢復靑年固有之少壯，　定一切幸福之　　，那時縱不能躋於標準美之　，但必可夠得上精力充沛的「健男」了。</p>
<h3 id="c153">健美、女子的健美與乳峯 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>乳峯發育的良好，的確可以增加女性健美的姿態。所謂女性的曲綫美，無疑地是由高聳的乳峯，襯托着豐腴的臀部而成。所以乳峯發育的健全，幾爲時代女郞所必備的條件。但是在這種動亂的時代裏，不幸常會降臨到婦女們的身上來，最普遍的現象，就是身體的衰弱症，如月經不調，經脹經痛，白帶不感，神經衰弱等，這種女子卵巢機能旣受其摧殘，新陳代謝作用亦因以减退，是以旣面黃肌瘦，乳　　衰，雖年齡尙在妙齡，而已呈衰老難看之至，此時雖滿　脂粉，胸用乳罩，以期假裝健美，但明眼人一看便知，　益增其醜！並且此種疾病拖延不治，將成貧血癆瘵，有生命之優！醫學家爲適應此種實際需要。乃刻苦硏究，發明卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，如一經服用，旣可增進卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，則不特可以治愈婦女的各種暗疾，且可使乳峯發育，皮膚白嫩，面頰紅潤，增進健美，如繼續服用，更可使年齡减輕，延年益壽，永駐靑春，豈不是女性之寳！</p>

<h3 id="c155">春秋　霞飛路上白俄過新 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>每年國曆的一月八日，是崩潰了的俄羅斯帝國的冬至節，在那一天，那些流浪在上海的白俄男女，照例是有一天一夜的狂歡的；而一月十四日却爲他們的舊曆元旦，在這一天，這三萬多的被祖國遺棄的人們，又得照例　來一番慶祝。今年當然也不能例外，因爲他們雖已失去了權貴的勢位，而且已不容於祖國了，但是回憶到過去沙皇時代的光榮與驕佚的生活，我想，他們多少總不免有點滄桑之感的吧。</p>
<p>今天，我爲了想知道一點舊俄元旦的情形，所以特地跑到白俄集居得最多的霞飛路去，作一次簡單的巡禮。在那兒，我們自然不會看到法國國慶節一般的狂熱，也見不到聖誕節（外國冬至）一樣的盛况，然而，許多白俄的商店和住宅門前，似乎已點綴上了新年的氣象，簡陋的紥彩，整齊的服裝，他們或她們，已經悄悄地度過了歲尾，而準備來慶祝今天的年首了。</p>
<p>在人行道上，常常會遇到三三兩兩的白俄年靑人，他們或她們全穿上了一身半新舊的衣服，在談笑着，似乎是上親戚那裏去，或赴宴會去的，路傍的白俄籍孩子也在頑皮地嬉戲着；他們也和中國的孩子一樣，在新年　是快樂的幸福的。自然，他們决不會瞭解大人們的悲哀，因爲他們沒曾過着彼得格勒時候的光榮日子，雖然也時常聽得父母說：「從前我們在彼得格勒的時候。到了過新年，那眞是……」這一類矜誇而又含着無限追憶的話，可是孩子們不懂得這些，他們只知道過新年，在新年裏，應該有好的吃，好的穿，好的玩，不會想到自己乃是亡命者的子孫，不知幾時才能夠跟着父母踏進那遺忘了的祖國。</p>
<p>獨自個兒，在那條充滿了異國情調的霞飛路上闖着，看看一些大玻璃櫥裏陳列的現代貨品，立體擺設，再看看白俄商店門前那簡陋的新年點綴；突然，經過一家俄國菜館的門口，便下意地踅了進去。呵！這兒的瘋狂情形，和幾家俄國商店的冷落，却成了一個明顯的對比。裏面是擠滿了人，有穿着顏色不十分調和衣服的女人，有年輕的小夥子，然而最多的還是那些掛着勳章的帝俄時代的落拓軍官；但是，現在他們已以失去了昔日的英武姿態，只剩得一副滿臉　子頹喪灰黯的面容。他們在亳無顧忌地狂飲着酒，咆哮着，狂笑着，撕打着，他們全像完全喪失了理似的，把　空氣擾攘的非常混亂。但同時在這裹，我也發現了正在對　空杯流淚的俄羅斯跳舞姑娘。</p>
<p>他們或她們，爲什麽竟會變成這樣的性格呢，那也許是生活和環境所造成他們的自暴自棄，我對於這一　沒有了祖國的流浪人，表示着萬分的同情。</p>
<p>環龍路口的那家俄國戲院裏，今天也在表演着歌劇，烏克林社却在開着盛大的跳舞會；而據說，今天的俄國總　裏也要舉行着一個盛大的跳舞會呢。總之，今天是白俄狂歡的日子，他們或她們，都得暫時忘記了流浪者的悲哀，生活的痛苦，和過去的光榮，現在的恥辱，來盡情地　狂歡一下的。</p>
<p>今天，霞飛路上有着不同於往日的風光。這便是白俄商店白俄　館子中的，儘量的瘋狂狂歡，然而，我以爲與其說是慶祝元旦，倒不如說他們對於昔日生活的回想吧。因爲，一個沒有了國家的人，還有什麽慶祝可言呵！</p>
<p>我　進了　浪路口的一家茶室裏去，一邊喝着茶，一邊便把剛才的印象記了出來，但當跨出茶室門的時候，路角上一個白俄老人，却伸出手向我討了一個分幣去。那時我想，他也在過元旦麽？　（方舟）</p>

<p>雷電華出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>李滋兄弟的「三騎士」後，又看到了馬克司兄弟的「破靴黨」了。這幾位好萊塢的胡鬧健將，人們對於他們的印象甚至是不及勞萊哈台的；果然，他們爲「胡鬧」則一也。</p>
<p>一談到滑稽片，我們會不自禁地想起卓別林來（在看滑稽片的時候自然更會想起他），他的「馬戲」，「城市之光」及「摩登時代」公映後，又和我們闊別數載了。所以，當他攝裝獨裁者　的消息透露出來後，全世界的影迷恐怕都在渴望這新片的早日和我們相見　。而且他已放棄了他先前的堅持，改攝聲片了。所謂聲片，當然不是把「字幕」改爲「對白」就了事，這在「摩登時代」是，我們已經看到這位猶太藝人對於「聲白」的運用了。－以上算是廢話。</p>
<p>「破靴黨」據說是紐約紅極一時的舞台劇改編的。把舞台劇改編電影，通常有一個最大的缺點，就是不能離開舞台的範疇，而電影的地演出；這一半是改編者的才能所限，而亦是「先入爲主」的影　所及。即如「破靴黨」，全劇的演出，幾乎都在一間大旅社的臥室之內，而馬克司兄弟又爲劇本爲限，不能盡展他們的「特長」，所能作爲滑稽片的特徵的，就是堆砌的對白，這些對白或許　就是這舞台劇的所以「戲極一時」了；但在電影上是並不適宜的。</p>
<p>「破靴黨」的故事，是寫一班貧窮的藝人困居在一家大旅社裹，不但積欠房金，而且一日三餐都發生問題了，於是旅館總監的下逐客令。忽有富翁願投資一萬五千元，上演他們的新劇，但是那張支票又發生停兌問題，當新劇啟幕的時候，這班貧窮的藝人被幽禁在旅室內，終於是假死作活而設計遁走。當旅館總監發現死人在台上出現的時候，暈了過去，而以首一輓歌的再合唱收塲。</p>
<p>窮藝人的到處碰壁，是「自古已然，而今尤烈」，好萊塢電影公司的採取這樣題材來作劇本，如「丹鳳朝陽」，「月宮樂園」之類，都是非常深刻地描寫這冷酷的社會所給予他們的遭遇，而使人們寄予無限的同情。「破靴黨」甚至這一點都沒有做到，而相反地使人感到這班藝人的討厭。</p>
<p>導演William　A　Seiter也祇是盡了一導演之職。祇是劇作家代維斯裝死，旅館總監威格勒以「人命事大」而一籌莫展的時候，馬克司三兄弟的禱吿，　花　，唱輓歌的那塲戲，是相當幽默的，而一室之內，突然從紛亂的胡鬧跌入靜穆的空氣，導演是還能把握當時的情緒的。</p>
<p>馬克司兄弟的演技，還是那付誇張得無可再誇張的動作。璐茜兒鮑爾和安密勒都無戲可做，祗是做過塲戲的點綴品罷了。</p>

<p>是的，過去的「四十年代劇社」，早就有人說過：這是王瑩金山的兩人的夫婦團體。</p>
<p>「王瑩金山」，「金山王瑩」，這呼聲是　　遍了上海。</p>
<p>現在，王瑩金山要出國了，　友人Ｗ君來信說：他們是到南洋去演戲，打算捐些錢來救濟難民的。</p>
<p>王瑩，她是安徽人，但她自己却說　明人。她的乳名呌桂貞；「王」是她的母親的姓，因爲她反對她父親，所以取消她父親的姓，表示反抗，也表示示威。</p>
<p>一九二九年先後，她由陳萬里的介紹進了中國公學的中國文學系，一二八後轉入暨南大學肄業，那時跟暨大同學一個姓吳的曾經打得火熱，但是，不知怎的後來兩人無緣無故的分手了。</p>
<p>話說王瑩在中公唸書的時候，同學中追求她的人簡直多得驚人，那時，她和幾個戲劇同志一塊兒住在北四川路，常常窮得連買米的錢都沒有。但是，中公同學却又偏在　飯的時候不肯離開那兒。後來，他們想了個辦法，滿壁大貼廣吿：「王瑩親自煮菜，飯菜每客大洋二角」，生意出乎意料之外的興隆，這樣，倒連他們自己的「麵包問題」也同時解决了。</p>
<p>一九三四年，她跳出「黑暗的電影圈」跑往東京去　天和日本左　文藝家秋田雨雀，和新興舞蹈專家野崎　夫等人交遊，居然在東京也紅透了半片天。日本的影片公司再三託人向她接洽，要她主演一二部影片。據說王瑩原想答應的，後來因爲受到留日學生的警吿才作罷的。一天，來了一個不速之客，他是日本警官學校裏的一個中國留學生，他要求見一見王瑩，但相見之下，他竟一言不發，只送了她一把短刀就返身跑了。</p>
<p>王瑩接了這一「禮物」後，知道即使不給日本影片公司主演影片也有「不妙」，所以就束裝歸國來了。</p>
<p>「生命自可貴，愛情更可高，</p>
<p>若爲自由故，兩者皆可拋。」</p>
<p>王瑩，您曾唱過這歌兒，我願您記住。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>這　導社中，有女職員，也有男職員。以前規定，凡是那外賓是男的，由男職員招待，那外賓是女的，由女職員招待，因此社中男女職員的數目是相等的。可是到後來，女職員反忙，男職員反閑，這是爲什麽呢？因爲到中國遊歷的，大都是帶了眷屬同來，或是同了太太，或是携着小姐，他們都喜歡女職員招待。爲的是女子溫柔而又細心，自然敎人熨貼，到後來社裏，漸漸的女職員多於男職員了。這　職員們，也許幾個星期，空閑着沒有一點事，也許一個星期裏忙的要命。不過每月的俸金，由社中支取，不論有事無事，總是一樣的。除了俸金這外，不許受外賓的饋贈，然而有些女外賓，往往因了情感上的關係，歸　以後，送什麽贈品給她們，也是有的。我今且說那位金澹雲小姐了，她在前幾天，正招待了一位女外賓，到中國來遊歷。那位女外賓，是美國的一位富孀，喚作蘇玾雅太太。這位蘇玾雅太太，在她的國內，本來是個實業家。如今聽見中國戰後新興，恢復力極大，她便想來投資。中國這時　，實在該興的事業太多了，譬如許多重工業，由國家主辦的多，許多輕工業，全由民間舉辦，只要在不失主權的條件下，也非常歡迎外賓投資。蘇玾雅太太也有不少中國朋友，所以在上海耽擱幾天以後，又到別處去了，恐怕不久仍舊要回到上海。自從蘇玾雅太太走了，金小姐得以淸閑幾天，因此來伴　何家兩位小姐游玩。汽車開至郊外時，只見四通八達，都是新築的路。不過路旁的房子還不多，只是疏疏落落的，有幾處竹　茅舍，自成鄕村風景。惟有近市處，都已造起房屋來了，有許多落成不久，有許多正在　工。金澹雲笑道：「上海地方，有許多古怪的話兒那些新造的路，他們還是呼之爲馬路。其實現在馬車早已絕跡了，還用這個名兒。如南京路，九江路，呼之爲大馬路，二馬路等等，有些可笑。好像你們廣東，不是這樣。」何雙玉道：「我們那裏稱之爲什麽道，什麽道。其實道也路也，還不是一樣嗎？」　（一四）</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Government Sends Strong Protest to Japan: Does Not Recognize Changes Made by Force; Konoe and Arita's Repeated Declarations Seen as Attempt to Dominate China; British Side Expresses Serious Concern and Resolves to Abide by the Nine-Power Treaty <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, it was officially announced here that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, presented a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday. The note, in strong language, expressed the British government's serious concern regarding Japan's policy toward China. The note clearly stated that Britain adheres to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and mentioned that the British government has studied the declarations of Japanese politicians, such as the Konoe statements of November 3rd and December 22nd, and Arita's remarks to reporters on December 19th, which outlined Japan's new policy toward the Far East situation, and has serious doubts and concerns. These concerns have not been alleviated by the British Ambassador's meeting with the Japanese Foreign Minister. The British government understands that the Japanese government's intention is to establish a "Japan-China-Manchukuo Triangular Bloc," with Japan occupying a position of superiority, and China and Manchukuo both subordinate to Japan. As far as China is concerned, it is said that the Japanese government at least intends to use the "Asia Development Board" to implement control over China in the near future. The "Asia Development Board" is responsible for formulating and implementing policies concerning China's politics, economy, and culture. Arita's remarks to reporters indicated that the aim of the triangular bloc is to form an economic unit, and that the economic activities of other countries must be subject to the restrictions dictated by the bloc's defense needs and economic security. According to the Konoe declaration, the war against China will continue until the Chinese government is shattered or agrees to accept Japanese conditions and join the bloc. Furthermore, China must conclude an anti-communist agreement with Japan, and Japanese troops will be stationed in designated locations within China indefinitely, presumably to guarantee the fulfillment of Japan's armistice terms. In addition, Konoe declared that Inner Mongolia should be treated as a special anti-communist zone. The British government, lacking more detailed information, can only assume that Inner Mongolia will be subject to Japanese military control to an even greater extent than other parts of China. The British government truly does not understand how Konoe's guarantee that Japan does not want to occupy Chinese land and intends to respect Chinese sovereignty can be reconciled with the Japanese government's declared intention to force the Chinese people to accept its conditions. These conditions would subject China's political, economic, and cultural life to Japanese control, maintain a large number of Japanese troops stationed in China indefinitely, and effectively separate Inner Mongolia from China. The British government wishes to declare that Britain is not prepared to accept or recognize changes brought about by force. Britain will adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and cannot endorse unilateral changes to its provisions. Before the outbreak of this war, the beneficial effects that the treaty could have hoped to achieve were being gradually realized. (The note is not finished; the remaining text of the telegram has not arrived and will be continued tomorrow morning.) (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Following the presentation of the note by British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to the Japanese government yesterday, the Sunday Times commented, "Japan is determined to close the Chinese market and exclude Western countries. What applies to Britain and the United States also applies to Germany and Italy." The note presented by the British government yesterday used firm language to explain Britain's attitude toward this policy. The firmness of its wording is almost unprecedented since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Its content states that any action to unilaterally amend existing treaties will be firmly rejected by Britain, but does not oppose discussing amendments through negotiations. In other words, Britain has adopted the same policy as the United States. Although the content of the British note is not identical to the note presented by the US government to Japan last December, the principles on which they are based are the same. In addition, although the British note does not imply that retaliatory measures will be taken against Japan, this measure has indeed been studied by the relevant departments of the Foreign Office and is not entirely impossible. However, in the short term, it does not seem that such strong action will be considered." (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Wang Jingwei's Conditions <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Wang Jingwei affair need not be discussed again. However, in the past few days, newspapers have continued to report on it, and there are still points that are difficult to remain silent about, so I will elaborate further. For example, the Chongqing telegram on the 10th stated: Because Wang's telegram was still moderate in tone and had no active betrayal, the central government will temporarily remain silent and wait and see. Readers who are concerned about the overall situation then ask whether there is a way for the central government and Wang to gradually negotiate; this is the first point. Another example is the Tokyo telegram on the 14th: Wang's confidant in Hong Kong stated that Wang is still determined to negotiate peace with the Japanese side based on the following conditions: (1) resolutely oppose communism, (2) conclude a Sino-Japanese anti-communist agreement, (3) the country cooperates with Germany and Italy, (4) China and Japan closely cooperate in political, economic, and cultural aspects. Readers who are concerned about the overall situation then ask whether we will actually have negotiations with Japan through Wang; this is the second point. Another example is the Hong Kong telegram on the 14th: Wang intends to strive to obtain the support of the Chinese army and Kuomintang leaders to conclude an honorable peace with Japan, and his followers have been ordered to set up an office in Hong Kong to guide the peace movement. Readers who are concerned about the overall situation ask about Wang's potential, and also worry about his conspiracies; this is the third point. There are even those with muddled minds and wavering wills who think that it is better to be lenient with his punishment and sit and watch his success or failure, perhaps there is a shortcut to follow?</p>
<p>As far as we know, the central government's attitude towards the war of resistance is strong and unwavering, and no rhetoric or coercion can shake it. It deeply abhors Wang Jingwei's words and deeds this time; but after expelling him from the party and removing him from his position, although all parties have requested the most severe punishment, the central government has not taken further action, not because it still has expectations for Wang. If Wang turns back at this point and carries thorns to plead guilty, how the central government will deal with it is certainly unknown, but to say that the central government, in its capacity as the authority over the entire nation, would still have so-called negotiations with a fickle, law-breaking, and discipline-breaking person is not appropriate and will certainly not happen. The reason for observing silently after Wang's telegram is only to see whether there is any active act of betrayal, and not to have any other expectations. If Wang continues in his stubbornness, running counter to morality, he will only lead a few lackeys in areas with fewer overseas Chinese, and live his life of a fool dreaming, to end his remaining years. But looking at the Tokyo side's attitude since Wang's telegram was issued, they treat him with indifference; how could it be said that Wang's disillusionment is getting closer and closer, and instead take him as a negotiating partner for peace? Japan is truly in a dilemma, experiencing the sorrow of doing many unjust things and wanting to stop but being unable to. However, to transform itself and leave, it has its own puppets to use as tools, and Wang is not its choice. Some say that there are people in Shanghai who are running around for Wang, and the Japanese seem to be colluding with them, how can we know that this is not the beginning of peace talks? This statement is fundamentally unlikely to be credible, and fraud is a common phenomenon in the political market; those who collude with each other will end up with just virtual collusion. Even if they are colluding, at most it is only a puppet problem, not a peace problem.</p>
<p>Only Wang knows that his own body is not valued by others. Therefore, the so-called efforts to obtain support and lead the movement are all weak and final struggles that he subjectively feels are necessary. Although Wang cannot lure people, who would be lured by him? It is often heard that Wang was assassinated in Beijing in the past because his old subordinates resented Wang for his own honor and abandoning his group of people, and someone was angry and took this action; the lessons of the past can be learned, and his credibility has fallen to the ground. Now, after betraying the party and the country, what can he rely on to appeal to others? Taking a step back, some may hear his so-called conditions and his so-called honorable peace, and cannot help but be moved; not only wavering and sitting and watching his success or failure, but also feeling the temporary and personal pain of the war, and being optimistic about his success. Then try to examine his conditions; as for communism and anti-communism, the doctrine of belief cannot be forced to be the same; however, the sincere unity under the banner of the war of resistance stems from a strong national consciousness that is innate, and also recognizes the interests of the nation for generations to come, which transcends doctrine; even if one is dissatisfied with communism, China is not a communist China, who would be willing to surrender to the enemy because of dissatisfaction with communism? As for Germany and Italy, China values loyalty and forgiveness, so things like recognizing Manchukuo, withdrawing advisors, and despising envoys, China has endured to this extreme, in order to maintain its original diplomatic relations; when Wang was in the central government, he could not improve Germany and Italy's prejudices, and now he still takes cooperation as a condition for dealing with Japan, does this have any meaning? Taking another step back, in Wang's telegram, although we criticized it as wrong in the past, we once praised the withdrawal of troops as the most pleasing to hear; we only pointed out its absurdity because Wang mentioned it in the same breath as other conditions; but what about now? The four grand conditions do not mention the withdrawal of troops; isn't this more evidence of the incoherence of Wang Jingwei's thought?</p>
<h3 id="e23">Intense Air Battle Over Chongqing: Fierce Fighting for Forty Minutes, One Japanese Plane Shot Down, Over 300 Civilians Killed or Wounded, Blood and Flesh Everywhere, Japanese Planes Also Attacked Guilin and Tongguan <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, more than twenty Japanese planes appeared over Chongqing, attacking the eastern district. This was the first determined attack since the Nationalist Government moved here. The Japanese planes arrived in the afternoon and were immediately met with intense anti-aircraft fire. Chinese fighter planes also took off to engage them. According to unverified reports, one Japanese bomber was damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Chongqing residents reported seeing one Japanese plane trailing thick smoke. Other eyewitnesses also said that anti-aircraft fire damaged one Japanese plane. Today's attack focused on the northeast of the city and areas along both banks of the Jialing River. Many people were killed or wounded. Chinese fighter planes charged into the Japanese bomber formation, strafing them with machine guns. Onlookers on the ground heard the sound of the machine guns. Rescue teams rushed through the city, carrying the wounded to various hospitals on stretchers. Many of the wounded had injuries to their hands, and some had arms and legs severed by bomb fragments. At 1:30 PM, the air raid alarm suddenly sounded, as more than thirty Japanese planes were seen following the south bank of the Yangtze River upstream. An emergency air raid alarm was issued here when the Japanese planes passed Fuling. At that time, only six Japanese bombers could be seen from the ground, advancing in two formations. It was reported that the Minsheng Company pier at Chaotianmen was bombed, resulting in many deaths and injuries among the dock coolies. If Chongqing is subjected to heavy bombing, the casualties are feared to be horrifying, as the city is densely populated and there is no open space to escape in case of fire. It was reported that the Chongqing airfield was not bombed in this attack. Today, most of the bombs fell on the north bank of the Jialing River, so authorities expect many casualties on the north bank. Six bombs fell on the south bank, killing twelve and wounding twenty. Several bombs fell on the western suburbs. Although there are government offices in the area, the bombs all fell in open spaces or in the middle of the road, so there were few casualties. As late as tonight, the wounded were still being transported to the Canadian Hospital. There were many women among them. Hundreds of relatives and friends of the wounded gathered outside the hospital, inquiring about their condition. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The weather in Chongqing was clear today. At 12:20 PM, the air raid alarm sounded. At 1:00 PM, thirty-six Japanese bombers, escorted by forty fighter planes, attacked Chongqing. Their bombing targets seemed to include the western suburbs of Chongqing. Chinese anti-aircraft guns returned fire. Chinese and Japanese planes engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs. The fighting lasted for forty minutes. The air raid alarm was lifted at 2:00 PM. The worst hit area was the Chaotianmen pier, where statistics indicate that two hundred civilians were killed or wounded on the shore due to the explosion of several 300-pound bombs. Five civilian boats were also sunk in the Yangtze River, killing one hundred and fifty people. They originally thought that the river surface was the safest place during an air raid, but unexpectedly suffered this tragedy. After the bombing of Chaotianmen, blood flowed everywhere, and the situation was extremely tragic. Many of the wounded were sent to hospitals for treatment. The results of today's air battle have not yet been officially announced. It is rumored that the bombs dropped by Japanese planes in the western suburbs were far from their targets. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked Chongqing around 12:00 noon. Chinese planes and anti-aircraft batteries met them head-on with heavy fire. The Japanese planes hurriedly dropped dozens of bombs and fled. An investigation revealed that dozens of civilian houses were destroyed and over three hundred civilians were killed or wounded. The scene was extremely tragic. During the air battle, one Japanese plane was shot down by Chinese forces and found at Daxingchang in Jiangbei. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>

I have accompanied Chairman Chiang on inspections of various front lines. Although the soldiers and civilians on the front lines are currently suffering terrible pain and hardship, I have never heard a whisper of hope for peace negotiations. Only in the rear have I heard suggestions for peace negotiations among a few weak people lacking courage and confidence. In Guangxi, I visited the 76-year-old mother of General Li Zongren, who commands the battle on the north bank of the Yangtze River. She is not worried about her son's safety and says that her son is only fulfilling his duty. Madame Li also said that if necessary, China's 200 million women are prepared to rise up and resist the enemy with kitchen knives. Madame Chiang concluded by saying that if Chinese women unite and fulfill their duties in the current struggle, China will surely be victorious.

<p>(Hankou) Today, the Hankou Power Company suspended operations due to a coal shortage, and the concession area was plunged into darkness. The company's sole source of coal is located seven miles from Hankou. The company has made every effort to avoid a power outage, dispatching trucks to transport coal to Hankou. However, due to extremely poor road conditions, transportation is difficult, making it impossible to maintain a sufficient coal supply. It is rumored that there is hope of restoring the power supply tomorrow, but there is no guarantee. Although the Japanese military authorities have fulfilled their promise to supply the Hankou Power Company with 1,000 tons of coal per month, they apparently find it quite difficult, as ships coming to Hankou are fully loaded with goods and military supplies.

They have always supported the central government, loved and respected the leader, and obeyed the government's orders. In addition to contributing their efforts, they have been willing to sacrifice and strengthen their self-defense, which is sufficient to strengthen the military's strength. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Ministry of Finance Refuses to Approve Further Accommodation for the Request by the Inspector General of Customs to Overdraw and Repay Debts Guaranteed by Customs Revenue, Because Japanese Troops Have Seized Customs Revenue, Making It Impossible to Repay Debts, and It Would Be Unfair to Subsidize Them for a Long Time <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance has issued the following notice regarding debt repayment methods: The government has always fulfilled its debt repayment obligations on schedule, especially for debts and indemnities guaranteed by customs revenue, which have never been overdue. In the past, due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, and global economic crises, when there were tax revenue shortfalls and insufficient funds to allocate, the government repeatedly transferred and subsidized large sums to maintain creditworthiness and protect the interests of creditors, paying on schedule. All these efforts have long been recognized by both Chinese and foreign parties. Unexpectedly, since the Japanese invasion, they have seized customs revenue in the war zone, using our financial resources as a tool to invade us, and have used all kinds of deceitful and coercive tactics to deposit all customs revenue for debts guaranteed by customs in Japanese banks. The amount of debt that should have been allocated and not paid by the various customs in the war zone, which the government has transferred and allowed the Central Bank to overdraw and subsidize, has accumulated to a huge sum of 175 million yuan. In order to maintain domestic and foreign creditworthiness and protect the interests of creditors, the government has continued to pay on schedule despite incurring huge additional burdens. The Japanese have also forced the use of Japanese puppet banknotes and military scrip in the war zone, attempting to disrupt our financial system and reduce legal customs revenue. However, the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness has never wavered. The Central Bank has provided the required foreign exchange for customs debt repayment in full. All these measures demonstrate that the government has made its utmost efforts to protect the interests of creditors. However, at present, customs revenue in the war zone is being seized by Japanese forces and deposited in Japanese banks. Although nominally deposited, it is actually being used to seize our foreign exchange and increase their aggressive power. Therefore, the deposited funds are originally the tax revenue deposits of our customs commissioners, but they are not remitted as required. Their infringement of the rights and interests of friendly countries and the interests of Chinese and foreign creditors is undeniable. Under these circumstances, the government cannot but take appropriate measures. Therefore, the Inspector General of Customs' recent request for continued overdraft to repay debts has not been approved, and it has been ordered to allocate and pay from the tax revenue deposited in the relevant customs. In the future, for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs that were borrowed before the war and have not yet been cleared, the amount that should be allocated in proportion to the tax revenue of the various customs outside the war zone shall be transferred to the Central Bank on schedule for special storage. However, this method of proportional storage is only a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the various customs in the war zone transfer the previously stored and unpaid indemnity payments to the Inspector General of Customs as before, the government will naturally continue to allocate the debt fund as before at the same time to restore the pre-war situation.</p>

<p>(Paris) The French Navy is scheduled to hold exercises starting on the 18th of this month, focusing on protecting the communication lines between mainland France and its North African territories, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean. Coincidentally, the British Home Fleet is also maneuvering in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean during its spring cruise. The fact that Britain and France attach particular importance to freedom of navigation in the western Mediterranean and Atlantic during wartime, and recognize it as a current issue, can be seen from this move. According to the planned schedule, the French Mediterranean Fleet will patrol the coast of North Africa and conduct exercises in Tunisian waters, while the Atlantic Fleet will conduct exercises in the waters of the Azores and then sail to the port of Casablanca in French Morocco, North Africa, to join the Mediterranean Fleet. In addition, several French submarines will cross the Atlantic after the exercises and sail to the West Indies in the Americas, so that it will echo the example of the German submarine "Deutschland" sailing to Boston Harbor in the United States during the European War. French naval figures also said that because all countries have built submarines with great endurance, the situation in the Atlantic has changed. When the European situation was tense last September, Germany sent a submarine to the Atlantic for trial navigation, but it was abandoned halfway due to its low tonnage and insufficient endurance. This is why the German government asked Britain and Germany to increase the tonnage of submarines so that they could build submarines with greater endurance. The Atlantic Ocean is the meeting point of the traffic lines of all countries in the world to India, one being the Suez Canal, the second being the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and the third being the Panama Canal, all of which must pass through the Atlantic Ocean. At present, the US Navy is conducting exercises near the Panama Canal, while the British and French navies are conducting exercises in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, that is, on the two traffic lines of the Suez Canal and the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and the significance of this is worth pondering.

After the visits, they will return to the US naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, to conduct gunnery exercises. Also, 80 to 90 ships of the Pacific Fleet, which have already passed through the Panama Canal, will gather with the Atlantic Fleet at the Guantanamo naval base. It is said that this joint exercise will involve 200 warships, 200 aircraft, and 150,000 naval personnel. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Minister of Aviation La Chambre recently gave a speech to the press, explaining the reorganization of the French aircraft manufacturing industry and the recruitment of air force pilots and mechanics. He said that since June 15th of last year to September 15th, the government has added new equipment to the nationalized aircraft factories, and the total cost of mass production is 1,846,000,000 francs. In addition, a special factory has been set up to design various new models. As for the number of aircraft manufactured, the average number of military aircraft produced last year has increased from 41 to over 80. These aircraft are also the latest models, and their quality is two-to-one compared to the past. However, during the reorganization period, the manufacturing capacity of the factories could not be fully developed, so several aircraft were ordered from foreign countries to make up for the shortfall. Although only 80 military aircraft can be manufactured by the factories this month, it is hoped that the number can be increased to over 200 after the start of spring. As of now, only three of the six state-owned aircraft factories are manufacturing military aircraft, and the other three factories will be converted to military aircraft in a short period of time. At the same time, three private factories are also being reorganized. In this way, the manufacturing capacity of the country's factories can easily be doubled in the coming months. In addition, the number of trainer aircraft has increased from only 380 in 1937 to 1,000 last year. The number of mechanics who passed the exam last year was 860, which can be increased to 3,800 this year. The number of non-paid radio operators who passed the exam was 40 last year, which can be increased to 300 this year. The number of military aircraft pilots who passed the exam was 130 last year, which can be increased to 413 this year. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>London: Many correspondents from Sunday newspapers have recorded the details of the recent meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Hitler. The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent said that the meeting was crucial because the two men had stated their opinions and Hitler had slightly revealed his plans for 1939. Hitler assured Beck that he did not want to forcibly resolve the Danzig or Memel issues in the near future, nor did he want to force Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. He also had nothing to do with the unrest in Ukraine. Hitler said that the Soviet Union would "split" in two or three years, and that he intended to intervene when the time was ripe. However, the general theme of the conversation focused on the colonial issue. Hitler meant that Poland should immediately put forward its own colonial demands. Hitler gave Beck the impression that he was willing to convene a colonial conference with his own conditions before the end of the year. An Observer correspondent in Warsaw reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was originally scheduled to visit Warsaw in early March to return the visit, but due to the new situation caused by Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Czech Republic's intention to follow suit, he plans to visit Warsaw at the end of this month. Also, a Sunday Times correspondent in Warsaw reported that the opinion of the diplomatic community there is that the Franco-Polish alliance is now in a precarious state. A prominent politician said that only divine power can save it. The Polish official newspaper Polska also said that we should now regard the Franco-Polish alliance as if it does not exist. The correspondent also said that before Ribbentrop returns the visit to Warsaw, Hitler's confidant, General Goering, will visit Warsaw next week. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Germany Does Not Forget: Recovers Territory; Hitler and Polish Foreign Minister Discuss Distribution Plan <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources in Central European countries here have recently declared that when German Führer Hitler recently spoke with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, he touched upon the issue of colonies. Germany intends not only to recover its old colonies but also to ensure a colonial empire commensurate with Germany's national strength. In other words, it should be even larger than any other country's colonial empire. Furthermore, considering Britain's current national strength, the British Empire is indeed too large. Therefore, the current colonies should be redistributed within a short period, with a portion given to countries with overpopulation, such as Poland. In return, Poland would cede a portion of its territory to Germany. If this were to happen, all pending issues between Germany and Poland could be resolved at once, and Poland could also receive compensation in terms of colonies. However, Führer Hitler did not involve France. A certain person in political circles here recently commented on this news, saying that Germany's aircraft production averages 600 per month. Once the country's submarine tonnage is on par with Britain's, it will be able to blockade the British coast and intercept British merchant ships. Germany's intention is to deal with the British Empire, as can be seen from this. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) When German Führer Hitler met with Colonel Beck, the discussion was almost entirely limited to the colonial issue and the plan drafted by Führer Hitler. British officials, upon hearing the news, have taken it seriously. The Sunday Dispatch recently stated that Führer Hitler is drafting a colonial redistribution plan that is highly unfavorable to Britain. According to this plan, Poland, in exchange for not hindering Germany's expansion into Eastern Europe, especially the establishment of a Greater Ukraine, would receive a share in the colonial redistribution. Italy would also acquire some land. However, Foreign Minister Beck did not agree to accept any binding conditions, and the two sides decided to discuss the matter again in the spring of this year. Nevertheless, Führer Hitler's plan has put Poland in a difficult position. The plan to establish a Ukrainian state is something that Poland dares not openly support, nor does it wish to pursue an anti-British policy. While acquiring colonies is something Poland would like to hear, the prospect of realization is still remote, and the Eastern European issue is of more immediate concern. As for the current situation, Führer Hitler had previously given Prime Minister Chamberlain a promise not to raise the colonial issue within one or two years. This promise is still valid. However, Führer Hitler may employ a tactic similar to the one he used last year. In other words, he will simultaneously raise demands regarding expansion into Eastern Europe and the colonial issue, and then choose one to pursue. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Japan Again Uses Empty Threats Against Soviet Russia: Says Will Sever Diplomatic Relations If Fishing Issue Not Resolved by April <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable news received today by the Associated Press, unless Soviet Russia accepts Japan's demands and resolves the long-disputed fishing issue, Japan is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Japanese military officials believe that the Soviet Union will not accept the challenge. It is said that if the fishing case is not resolved satisfactorily by April, when the fishing season begins, Japan's plan will be implemented. At that time, if a Japan-Soviet agreement is still not established, Japanese fishing boats will sail to the north under armed escort to continue fishing. Japanese officials believe that it would be best for Japan to take action before the Soviet Union, recall its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, and then decide on a response based on the Soviet Union's actions. Furthermore, the Tokyo military leaders believe that the Soviet Union is currently preoccupied with the Ukrainian issue to cope with Germany and would not want to lightly start a war with Japan.

<h3 id="e41">Ferocity of Spanish Fighting Unprecedented Since Start of WWI: Nationalist Forces' Intense Artillery Fire and Fierce Air Raids; Government Forces Retreating, Situation Increasingly Tense <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Lerida. It is expected that Tarragona, a seaport 45 miles southwest of Barcelona, will be occupied by Nationalist forces tonight. On the central Catalan front, Nationalist forces have entered Barcelona province near Coroma. On the southern front, Nationalist forces yesterday not only occupied Valls, 12.5 miles from Tarragona, but also advanced to a point less than 9 miles from Reus, the government forces' center of ammunition production in Tarragona province. Meanwhile, on the northern front, Nationalist forces have occupied positions within 6 miles of Sivella. It has been four weeks since General Franco led his troops across the lower Segre River on a cold night, and the Nationalist forces now control most of the new province. According to military observers, the intensity of artillery fire in some areas, coupled with aerial bombardment, is unprecedented in any European battle. It is reported that the government forces have suffered a total of 25,000 casualties in this area, including 50 prisoners. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Lerida. The Nationalist forces' fifth division of Seville entered Tarragona at 3:30 PM. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Burgos. The Nationalist government has issued a war report stating that Nationalist forces on the Catalan front have occupied the city of Tarragona. The city is an important strategic location on the Mediterranean coast. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Saragossa. Nationalist forces advanced 10 kilometers on the Catalan front today and have entered Barcelona province near the city of Coroma (65 kilometers from the suburbs of Barcelona). On the southern front, Nationalist forces have also captured the key points of Valls and Alcover. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Barcelona. According to a government forces' communiqué issued today, fierce fighting is taking place near Valls. Nationalist forces suffered heavy losses in the Agramunt area, and their advance has been halted. There has been no news here regarding the progress of the government forces' offensive on the Madrid and Extremadura fronts. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Barcelona. The situation in the city has become increasingly tense after the advance troops of the Nationalist forces entered Barcelona province. Conscripts marched in teams through the main thoroughfares before heading to the front lines. Many women and children gathered in front of the barracks to bid farewell to the conscripts. Slogans were posted throughout the city, all calling for resistance. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Barcelona. The Spanish government has issued an order that all male and female citizens between the ages of 17 and 55 can be conscripted by the government to perform necessary work. This general mobilization plan includes an order to call up reserve soldiers from 1915 to 1921, which will add at least 350,000 soldiers to the front lines, half of whom will come from Catalonia, a densely populated province. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Executive Committee of the World Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Congress issued a declaration today, calling on people of all countries to "actively assist the Spanish Republican government and concentrate efforts to resist Fascism." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) French newspapers have fiercely criticized demonstrations held in France in support of the Spanish Republic. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia stated that this is a dangerous move and that French interference in the Spanish civil war has not stopped. It is an organized conspiracy that endangers the political and national freedom of Spain and threatens the current situation in the Mediterranean, which cannot be changed. Italy is determined to maintain it by all means. Accordingly, Italy and all of Europe should pay close attention to France's actions regarding Spain. European nations that do not want the Soviet Union to exert its influence on the Spanish Republican government will not allow arrogant imperialism to do as it pleases without being stopped. In short, a self-reliant Spain that can maintain its political characteristics is not enough to threaten France, but if France threatens Nationalist Spain and takes adventurous actions, it will inevitably harm itself.

<p>Budapest, Hungary. Foreign Minister Csáky left for Berlin today at 1:15 PM via Vienna. Before departing, he told the press, "The friendly relations between Germany and Hungary are both in line with the needs of practical politics and in accordance with Hungarian public opinion. The Hungarian nation and Regent Horthy have been loyal to Germany both during and after the European War. This is why the great German race respects us. Moreover, Germany's respect for us has brought us concrete benefits before and after the Munich Conference. We have already invoked the racial principles advocated by Germany and Italy and have achieved considerable results." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris. Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact and the upcoming visit of Foreign Minister Csáky to Berlin have been commented on here. There are three aspects that should be noted: 1. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently visited Germany and held talks with Führer Hitler. Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Germany was in fact triggered by Colonel Beck's trip. Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact shows that it has decided to base its foreign policy on the German-Italian axis, thereby weakening its agreement with Poland. Poland's policy in Hungary has been overcome by Germany. In other words, Hungary originally wanted to maintain a balance between Germany and Poland, but it has now changed its policy and is following Germany. 2. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited the Hungarian capital last December and advised the country to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which has now achieved its goal. Germany and Italy previously had different opinions on the issue of Poland and Hungary sharing a border, but this has now been resolved, with Hungary abandoning its original plan and seeking compensation from Romania and becoming closer to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's diplomacy is guided by Italy, which is beneficial to Italy. French observers therefore believe that the future meeting of officials from Italy, Yugoslavia, and Hungary has significant political implications. 3. Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact demonstrates that it is disregarding international opposition and is ideologically approaching totalitarianism. In this way, it will be easier for Germany to enter Romania via Hungary, which will be implemented after Poland is neutralized. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia. An official communiqué has been issued stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, at the invitation of Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, will come here within the next week to participate in hunting. Italy and Yugoslavia share a border and signed a friendship treaty in 1937. Foreign Minister Ciano's visit will be an opportunity to discuss various issues of mutual concern. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Paris. The French Refugee Relief Committee held its first meeting yesterday. Foreign Minister Bonnet attended and delivered a speech, stating that at least 100,000 Germans, considered non-Aryans in their own country, have crossed into France in the past few months. The French government is willing to continue to provide assistance to those seeking refuge here, but it cannot accommodate too many, lest its own people suffer significant losses due to the abuse of the poorly managed immigration law. France has already accommodated 3.2 million foreign nationals and 200,000 refugees, which is unprecedented in other countries. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London. It is rumored that when the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, recently discussed the issue of Jewish emigration in Berlin, Dr. Schacht, the Governor of the Reichsbank, stated that if the proposals put forward by his country could not be accepted by the countries concerned, Germany would be unwilling to continue paying the principal and interest on commercial loans. (Note: Germany's proposal advocates that the countries concerned increase the amount of German goods they import in order to raise funds for Jewish emigration.) Financial circles here are uneasy about this news. If this were to happen, the balance sheets of certain British banks would be seriously affected. In short, if Germany stops paying the principal and interest on commercial loans, either the Bank of England must fully advance the payments, or the private banks must suffer losses, which would greatly affect their profit and loss statements. Sources here also said that the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, did not consult the government before going to Germany, which has already caused dissatisfaction in some quarters. Now, if Germany stops paying the principal and interest on loans, Norman's responsibility will be even greater, and he may resign as Governor of the Bank of England. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Hollywood. "Gone with the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell, a novel depicting life in the American South, was a bestseller in Europe and the United States several years ago. After being adapted into a screenplay, the most attention-grabbing role of the female lead, Scarlett O'Hara, has been given to English actress Vivien Leigh. Other leading roles include Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes, and Melanie will be played by Olivia de Havilland. Producer David O. Selznick purchased the film rights to the novel several months ago and immediately began searching for a "typical Scarlett O'Hara." Selznick stated that he chose an English actress to play this Southern beauty because English women can usually master the Southern accent easily. Many famous actresses were considered for the role of Scarlett, including Katharine Hepburn and Norma Shearer. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to information revealed by the State Department today, among US aircraft factories, only United Aircraft Corporation has not complied with government advice since July of last year and supplied aircraft and parts to countries that massacre civilians. The so-called countries that massacre civilians clearly refer to Japan. Furthermore, the State Department today "expressed great regret" over the case of issuing 600 propeller blades worth US$102,000 to Japan in mid-December of last year to United Aircraft Corporation. It is said that in the first half of last year, Japan purchased US$9 million worth of aircraft from the US. Afterwards, the State Department sent letters to various aircraft factories, advising them to voluntarily ban the export of aircraft, parts, and aerial torpedoes in order to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Since then, US exports of aircraft and parts to Japan have decreased sharply, forcing Japan to turn to Germany and Italy for purchases in the past six months. At the same time, because Germany and Italy must keep the latest aircraft for their own use, the aircraft Japan obtained are far inferior to those previously purchased from the United States. Therefore, from this spring onwards, the strength of the Japanese air force is bound to weaken. At the same time, with the replenishment of 200 new American bombers and the addition of 500 foreign volunteer pilots in China, the strength of the Chinese air force will inevitably increase significantly.

<p>Washington. Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha, at the invitation of President Roosevelt, is scheduled to come here soon to discuss various issues of mutual concern with the US government. The telegrams exchanged between President Roosevelt and Brazilian President Vargas regarding this matter have been released by the State Department. President Roosevelt telegraphed President Vargas on January 9, stating, "In the past few months, several international issues have arisen that are of great importance to both Brazil and the United States. It would be fortunate if these issues could be discussed frankly by officials of both governments in the spirit of traditional friendship and mutual assistance. I am now telegraphing to invite your Foreign Minister Aranha to visit Washington. If this is acceptable, please have him travel here at the beginning of next month." President Vargas replied today, accepting the invitation, and requested that the issues to be discussed by both sides be communicated to Brazil through diplomatic channels in advance. According to sources, the three issues that the US and Brazil will discuss at that time are: (1) Brazil's exchange management issues; (2) Developing trade through the import and export banks of both sides; (3) Strengthening the existing trade agreement between Brazil and the US.

<p>Washington. Assistant Secretary of War Colonel Johnson delivered a speech, calling on all citizens to unanimously support President Roosevelt's national defense plan. He said that aggressor nations often attack weaknesses rather than strengths, and do not compare themselves with countries that are stronger or equal in strength. The US must strengthen its national defense in order to force other countries to respect its rights. He then revealed some information from the archives of WWI to prove his point. One item said that the famous German generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff both expressed the opinion that "the US's participation in the European War is insignificant." Another item said that German Navy Commander von Holtzendorff reported to Wilhelm II, "I dare to guarantee Your Majesty as a military officer that not a single American soldier will be able to land in Europe." At that time, the US was not valued by Germany, and the rights it possessed were despised by Germany, as can be seen from this. Today, the strength of our country's national defense may not be known to most citizens, but foreign countries know it very well. Our duty lies in establishing extremely strong defenses so that future enemies must think twice before infringing on our country's rights, or even retreat in the face of difficulties.

<p>Rangoon. The unrest in Burma recently caused by the passive resistance movement has now spread to the national shipyard. Workers at the factory have begun to strike, and there is a danger of a general strike at the shipyard. There are currently 5,000 strikers in the city. This has become a rallying point for tenant farmers and bus drivers who are dissatisfied with their treatment to form a hunger squad. However, not all members of the group are lawless. The government is now trying to disperse the instigators. It is hoped that this method will prevent the general strike that the Dobama Asiayone party is currently trying to organize from succeeding. To date, a total of 39 people have been detained. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Geneva. Dr. Hu Shih-tse, Director of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, told an Associated Press reporter that US President Roosevelt's defense message has "significant meaning" for the Chinese appeal case on the League of Nations agenda. He also said that Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun will report to the League of Nations on the current situation in the Far East and may ask the League of Nations to pass a resolution to supplement the inadequacy of past League of Nations resolutions. Hu continued, "Since the last League of Nations Council meeting, the US has made several expressions regarding the situation in the Far East. Today's expression is even more active than past expressions, but it is still difficult to say whether it will help the League of Nations' resolutions." Hu also said, "Since China's resistance war began 18 months ago, its determination has been clear and unwavering, which has been seen by all countries. Furthermore, although the Japanese side claims to respect the interests of third countries, the opposite is true. The interests of foreigners in China are despised by the Japanese side, which shows that the interests of people of all countries are in fact consistent with those of China. Although China is willing to protect the interests of foreigners in China, it also hopes that foreigners can use their own strength to prevent the Japanese from infringing on the interests of foreigners."

This area was first explored and mapped by a Norwegian expedition in early 1929. This new territory has become an important area for Norwegian whaling in recent years. Norway does not exclude other countries from whaling in the area, but Norwegian whalers will be protected and their legitimate activities will not be interfered with by other countries.

<p>Huzhou Correspondence: Nanxun town, under Huzhou jurisdiction, was attacked by a unit of Chinese troops on the first of this month, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. Because the aim of the Chinese troops was to annihilate the Japanese forces, on the 20th, they set out again from the ××× base area to attack the town. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese troops immediately retreated to the outskirts. The Chinese troops then advanced from Nan Zha and reached Nanxing Bridge, where they destroyed the Japanese fortifications with hand grenades. They continued to search for the Japanese, but found nothing, so they withdrew to their original position. After learning that the Chinese troops had retreated, the Japanese soldiers regrouped and indiscriminately fired machine guns on Nanxing Bridge, resulting in numerous bullet holes in the walls of the buildings.</p>
<p>Wuzhen, under the jurisdiction of Wuxing County, had been peaceful since it was recaptured by Chinese troops last year. Unexpectedly, on the 8th, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in areas such as Nan Zha, causing panic among the people. On the 12th, suddenly, five or six hundred Japanese soldiers, travelling on more than ten motorboats from the Jiaxing area, approached the vicinity of Bei Zha, attempting to land. This was discovered by the Chinese troops, who immediately set up machine guns and small cannons along both the east and west banks to ambush them. At that time, two Japanese motorboats were hit and sank. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the Japanese troops hastily retreated towards Shuanglin. It is said that the Chinese troops suffered more than ten casualties in this battle. Not counting those who drowned, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed.</p>

<p>Huizhou Correspondence: In this instance of the Japanese troops invading Guangdong, they landed at Daya Bay, and since the East River (Dongjiang) is a strategically important point, the counties and cities along the East River, such as Huiyang, Boluo, Danshui, Dongguan, Shilong, and their nearby villages, were the first to bear the brunt, suffering various calamities such as arson, looting, rape, and murder. Fortunately, Huiyang, Boluo, and Danshui have been successively recovered, but having been ravaged by the enemy's iron heel, their essence is lost, the houses are in ruins, and the fields are full of refugees. Even a casual inspection brings unbearable pain. According to investigations, there are over 300,000 refugees alone crying out for food. The local government is currently carrying out relief work, which is also being managed by philanthropists and relief organizations from various parties. However, due to difficulties in raising funds and during wartime, all measures are particularly difficult. The post-disaster situation in Huizhou, Boluo, Danshui, and other places is briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>Huizhou</p>
<p>Huizhou city is a crucial military location, so it suffered the most severe damage. Before its fall, it had already been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, and nearly half of the city's businesses had been destroyed. After the city fell, it was again set on fire by the Japanese. Currently, in the Shuishang Street area of the county seat, 80% of the shops have been burned. In the Wanshi Fang and Dashijie areas of the prefectural seat, half of the shops have been burned. Rural villages attached to the city, such as Shangxiatangxia and Shaibuchang, have had their houses completely burned down. The Dongxin iron bridge connecting the prefectural seat and the county seat was destroyed by the Japanese troops during their retreat. In addition, many villages near Huizhou city have suffered extensive looting. There are currently more than 4,000 refugees in the city. The Huiyang Chamber of Commerce is distributing porridge at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, twice a day, but due to the large number of people, the food supply is a serious problem. Currently, the refugees are scattered throughout the city, and the resettlement problem has not been resolved.</p>
<p>Boluo</p>
<p>The location of Boluo County is as important as Huizhou, and the disaster situation is even worse than Huizhou. The shops in the county seat have been almost completely burned, and nine out of ten businesses are empty. More than half of the civilian houses have been destroyed by bombing. The people have fled in all directions. Although the Chinese troops have now recovered the area, very few people have returned. The resumption of business is even rarer. The county magistrate has now returned to the county to preside over relief work. Although the Japanese troops have retreated, Japanese aircraft still occasionally fly over the territory for reconnaissance. In terms of transportation, only the wooden boat traffic between Huizhou and Boluo has resumed. The disaster situation in the nearby areas is most severe in Paiwei Lake, Qinu Lake, Lian'an, Tianpai, Yihe, Xinzaitang, Biaohua, Henghe, Guoshi, Futian, Lianhe, Shuibei, and other places. It is estimated that there are 130,000 to 150,000 refugees in the above-mentioned areas, urgently in need of relief.</p>
<p>Danshui</p>
<p>A total of 702 houses in Danshui city and nearby villages have been burned and bombed. More than 100 people have been killed by bombing in the city and outside the market. Several hundred people have died from starvation, cold, and disease while fleeing. 3,000 people have been displaced and homeless. At the beginning of the relief work, due to the lack of everything after the looting, iron pots, stoves, and all utensils were extremely inconvenient. Therefore, only rice was distributed daily for the refugees to cook themselves. The disaster situation in the villages and towns along both sides of the Hui-Danshui Highway is extremely severe. Xin Xu, Foshanao, Tonghe, Zhenlong, Yazi Bu, and other places have been turned into scorched earth. Shops and civilian houses have been completely burned. The number of refugees is countless. A total of 539 houses have been burned in the various streets of the Shu Xu pig market. The disaster situation in Yazi Bu is considered the most severe, with refugees everywhere, and the number is still being investigated. The first priority is to provide porridge for emergency relief and to rescue the sick. The disaster-stricken areas include more than 1,000 destroyed houses in Ping Le South Township, more than 130 burned houses in Ping Le North Township, more than 490 in Zhenlong Township, more than 100 in Jiazi Bu Xu, more than 80 in Zhenlong Xu, more than 30 in Bu Zai Xu, and more than 40 in Liansheng Xu, for a total of about 3,000 houses.</p>
<p>Shilong</p>
<p>After the Chinese troops recovered Huizhou and Boluo, the Japanese troops retreated to Zengcheng and Shilong, still planning to resist stubbornly. However, the Chinese troops advanced forward with great courage and sharpness, and soon recovered Zengcheng. They then took advantage of the victory and advanced towards Shitan, Xintang, Yao, and Shilong. The Japanese troops blew up the bridge on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng section of the second provincial highway in an attempt to obstruct the Chinese troops' advance. However, the Chinese guerrilla forces had already been active behind the Japanese troops and had cut off the traffic between Shilong and Zengcheng. The Japanese troops had no choice but to retreat and gather in Shilong. As of the 8th, Chinese troops had surrounded the northeast sides of Shitan and Shilong. At the same time, the Chinese troops and county guerrilla forces along the East River and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were attacking Shilong and Wancheng in Dongguan, and fierce battles had already begun. It is reported that there are only 200 Japanese soldiers in Wancheng, and the surrounding areas outside the city are already under the control of the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops can only close the doors and defend to the death. Since Shilong was occupied by the Japanese troops, it has been subjected to extremely cruel destruction. The people, due to the Japanese troops' humiliation and massacres, have tried every means to escape, leading to an inhuman existence, which is extremely distressing. It is reported that the number of deaths is nearly 1,000 or more, and the number of houses burned and bombed has also reached 1,000. Japanese military tickets and Japanese paper currency flood the market, and the Japanese troops force the citizens to use them. Any slight violation is met with brutal killing. The Japanese troops also instigated thugs to open opium dens and gambling houses to poison the people. Existing brothels were also restored by thugs, and there were even Japanese brothels, and the order was extremely chaotic. Japanese troops and thugs openly looted, several times a day. Businesses that were unattended had long been looted, and even those that were guarded only closed their doors and cowered in fear of unexpected disasters. The scene is not only very desolate, but also full of the atmosphere of burning and killing, truly a city of demons. Recently, due to the successive victories of the Chinese troops in Huizhou, Boluo, and Zengcheng, the Japanese troops were greatly panicked and forcibly conscripted the people to build fortifications in the suburbs and at the railway station. However, the people eagerly hoped that the Chinese troops would recover Shilong as soon as possible, so they could see the light of day again.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Enthusiastic Enlistment of Civilians from Chaozhou and Meizhou; Over 200,000 Rural Youths Join the Military; Numerous Ardent Youths Apply to the Central Military Academy; Regiment Commander of the Conscription Regiment Volunteers to Fight the Enemy <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the July 7th Resistance War, the commanders of the Conscription Regiments of various counties in Chaozhou and Meizhou have been ordered to mobilize youths to join the army. To date, seven phases have been completed. The quota of new recruits in each county is drawn according to the number of people on the household register, and the quota is always filled. Each county sends 1,600 to 2,000 people per phase (one out of every thousand). In total, Chaozhou and Meizhou have sent over 200,000, which are transferred to the front for training and replenishment. The new recruits sent in each phase are all strong men from rural areas, with a very strong sense of national consciousness. When the youths enlist, the whole village sets off firecrackers and holds a farewell banquet to see them off, with the belief that the people take pride in defending the country through military service, so they compete with each other to be enlisted first. Since last year, more than a hundred female students from various girls' schools in Meixian have dressed as men and volunteered to join the army at the Conscription Regiment. The central government believes that the morale of Chaozhou and Meizhou is usable, and has repeatedly established battle merits in the front, such as Yao Ziqing, who defended Baoshan City, and Xie Jinyuan, who defended the Sihang Warehouse, were all from Meixian. Also, the subordinates of Li Hanhun, Zhang Fakui, Wu Qiewei, Luo Zhuoying, Ye Zhao, Deng Longguang, and others are mostly from Chaozhou and Meizhou. Wherever their military force points, they have achieved miraculous feats. The military authorities therefore attach special importance to the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou. Last year, the Central Military Academy, the Military Police School, and the Railway School of the Ministry of Communications all recruited students in the counties of Meixian and Xingning. Because education is developed in these counties, and there are tens of thousands of middle school graduates every year, many young people are struggling to find a way out. The central government is selecting talents in this area, which is easier to get started with than in other areas. Starting this New Year, the Central Military Academy is recruiting students for the sixteenth phase and has specially set up a recruitment office in Xingning City, appointing Zhang Hanliang as the director. The registration period is from January 10 to 25. It is reported that 300 places will be accepted, with a middle school diploma or equivalent education. When this news came out, the number of people from various counties who applied was very enthusiastic, and has now exceeded 500. The county magistrates of Chaozhou and Shantou are also recruiting on behalf of the central government, so that those who are aspiring can apply to the county government nearby. Great importance is attached to the physical examination. All applicants must first pass the physical examination before being sent to Xingning for the examination. It is expected that there will be tens of thousands of applicants, and their enthusiasm for protecting the country and the nation can be seen from this. Luo Rihua, Zhou Weinan, You Guang, Xie Jinming, Wang Buqing, Peng De, Liu Zuoyao, Liu Wenyi, Li Cemou, Huang Yinghao, Jiang Jianping, Ye Guanqiu, Zhang Linmei, and Zeng Guozhen, etc., of the Chaoan Conscription Regiment, are handling the conscription of new recruits. Seeing the young people from various places rushing to join the army, they were greatly moved and felt the sense of renewed vigor. They specially petitioned to the higher authorities in the names of each other, wishing to go to the front line to fight the enemy, which has been approved. On the 3rd, Luo and others left for Xingning. Yan Yingyu, commander of the divisional headquarters, held a banquet to see Luo and others off. Various groups in Chaozhou and Shantou presented flags and bid farewell. Since the War of Resistance, the social atmosphere in Chaozhou and Meizhou has completely changed, becoming more and more enthusiastic and stronger and stronger. Speakers said that if the central government were to set up a special agency in Chaozhou and Meizhou to recruit young and aspiring people, then one million new soldiers could be recruited in a short period of time. It can be seen from this that there is no shortage of soldiers for this War of Resistance.</p>

<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Jiaozhi is an important town in Kunshan, with a dense population. Pan Zhichang, the boss of Zhaochang Cloth Shop in the town, is one of the local tyrants. After the Japanese troops arrived in the town, Pan, braving the greatest disapproval, organized a puppet maintenance society, appointed himself as the puppet chairman, set up checkpoints to collect taxes on goods entering and leaving, and used general hooligans to extort and exploit the people, doing everything possible. He also engaged in large-scale trafficking of drugs, so the profits were very high. Recently, Pan even opened a large gambling den in three rooms of the Fuli Elementary School. Countless ignorant farmers spend tens of thousands of dollars there every day, and there are also many who lose their fortunes. At the same time, the atmosphere of opium smoking is also strong. There are many dens of vice. Since opium and gambling are rampant, Pan extracts taxes from them, in addition to filling his own pockets, he also supplies a portion to the Japanese troops. This is truly a loss of conscience.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Tactics of the New Fourth Route Army: Secret and Rapid Attacks on the Japanese Army <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Continuation of the dispatch from American Evening News special correspondent Belden: The New Fourth Route Army, commanded by Xiang Ying and Ye Ting, is under the command of General Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone, and is ordered to wage guerrilla warfare. According to Xiang Ying's analysis, the characteristics of guerrilla warfare are: Elusiveness, Taking the offensive, Not building positions, Surprise attacks, Retreating when encountering superior forces, Decisive battles when encountering exhausted troops, Avoiding strength and attacking weakness, But taking the initiative to strike the opponent first, Night battles. Of course, the above are all very vague, but guerrilla warfare cannot be talked about in definite terms without giving actual examples. Before taking the offensive, guerrilla units must scout the enemy's situation, such as the number, habits, sentry posts of the enemy, and when they are most lax. After detecting the enemy's weaknesses, they concentrate their attack on this point. If the Japanese army's defense is tight and there is no weakness to attack, the guerrilla teams lie in ambush nearby and launch a sudden attack when the Japanese army goes out, and then quickly retreat. If the Japanese army does not leave its large troop garrison, the New Fourth Route Army will use the masses, asking them to jointly cut off all Japanese army transportation, so that they cannot get food. If the Japanese army goes out to find food, the guerrilla teams will attack them. The New Fourth Route Army often uses the method of attacking sentries to lure the main force of the Japanese army out of its fortified defense, and then attacks it from behind. Guerrilla warfare values secrecy and speed, making sure the enemy does not know there are guerrilla units in the area. Therefore, the New Fourth Route Army often goes a hundred or two hundred miles away to attack, marching at night. If they cannot reach their destination in one night, they continue to move forward the next night. The New Fourth Route Army's operations usually use at least 400 people as a unit. Guerrilla soldiers must know how to retreat, because they often encounter enemy reinforcements, resulting in a disparity in military strength. Before each attack, they must reveal the retreat route of each soldier and how to respond after an unsuccessful attack. The attacking units are often divided into several small teams, instructing each small team's retreat route and pre-designating the meeting place after the retreat. Because it is often possible to get lost when retreating, the importance of working with the people can be seen from this. The New Fourth Route Army once attacked Jurong, southeast of Nanjing, broke into the city, and occupied the southeast corner of the city, but the Japanese army was still building defensive works in the city and stubbornly resisted. The New Fourth Route Army could not immediately capture the city. When Japanese reinforcements arrived, the New Fourth Route Army dispersed and retreated. Because its retreat routes were extremely numerous, the Japanese army could not concentrate its attack, and could only pursue a small part of them at most, while the rest all retreated. From a logistical point of view, the New Fourth Route Army is one of the poorest equipped in the Chinese army. It has no cannons of any kind. They even say they have no mortars, but this statement is still questionable. There are very few machine guns, and light machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades are also incomplete. According to Xiang Ying's estimation, if each heavy machine gun has the firepower equivalent to 30 rifles, and each light machine gun has the firepower equivalent to 10 rifles, and if the Japanese army replaced all their machine guns with rifles, then the Japanese army's firepower would be ten times greater than that of the New Fourth Route Army. The organization of the New Fourth Route Army's units also varies. The army has four columns, and each column is equivalent to a division, but this is not in terms of numbers, but in terms of command. What distinguishes this army from other regular armies is that it has no brigades. The number of people in each column is also not fixed, some have three regiments and some have four. Another difference from most other armies is that each column does not receive supplies directly from the supply base, but is transferred by the general headquarters. However, neither the supply base nor the general headquarters supplies each column with food, but issues funds for the soldiers to purchase their own. Each soldier receives ten cents a day to buy rice and five cents to buy vegetables. If, for other reasons, the funds cannot be delivered to the front line as scheduled, the captain will borrow from the people. Because money is always repaid after each borrowing, the people generally trust them. According to Xiang Ying, the basic strategy of the New Fourth Route Army is to exhaust the enemy's strength, obstruct their transportation lines, delay their invasion, and assist friendly forces in promoting regular warfare, and then gradually train guerrilla soldiers into the regular army, so that in the future, when the enemy withdraws from China, they can be intercepted.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Japanese Troops Attempt to Repair the Nanxun Railway for Military Use; Guerrilla Forces Destroy the Ruiwu Highway; Chinese Troops Once Rushed into the City of Ruichang <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: The Nanxun Railway was heavily damaged when the northern section of the Chinese army retreated. After the Japanese troops arrived, military transportation was quite inconvenient. The Chinese guerrilla forces in the suburbs were also very active, and the Japanese troops were repeatedly attacked and suffered losses. Therefore, the Japanese troops found it extremely difficult to repair the road, and the project was huge and full of obstacles, so progress was slow. The 23rd Regiment of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army in Kyoto, which had previously fought on the Nanxun Railway line, was transferred back for reorganization due to heavy casualties. After the reorganization was completed, it returned to Jiujiang in early November and is now helping 500 Korean female soldiers who came from Dean to protect the road together to facilitate military transportation. Therefore, the Nanxun Road was forced to open to traffic to Huanglaomen on the 28th of last month (Huanglaomen Station is between Shahe and Majieling). In order to reduce the attacks of the Chinese guerrilla forces, the Japanese troops ordered the residents east of the railway line in the Shahe area to move to the west of the railway line by a certain date. The Chinese guerrilla forces were also very active in the Ruiwu Highway area. On the 19th of last month, the roadbed of the highway from Fanjiapu to Wangjiapu, which is about 70 miles long, was thoroughly destroyed, and all bridges and telegraph poles were burned. On the night of the 29th of last month, the Chinese army on the eastern outskirts of Ruichang City once rushed into the city and fought the Japanese troops in the streets. The Chinese army swept the Japanese army in the city for about three hours. Later, because the Japanese troops constantly reinforced their counterattacks, the Chinese army, with the aim having been achieved, voluntarily withdrew from the city. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed and countless military supplies were seized. The Chinese army also suffered slight damage.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Various Fellow Provincial Organizations of Hu Province Held a Memorial Service for Wang Yiting Yesterday; The Ceremony Was Extremely Solemn; Respectfully Bestowing the Posthumous Title of "Lord Minghui" <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, eighteen fellow provincial organizations from Hu Province held a memorial service for the late Wang Yiting at the Hu She (Hu Society) on Guizhou Road, and respectfully bestowed upon Mr. Wang the posthumous title of "Lord Minghui." Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue</p>
<p>The memorial service was held in the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall of the Hu She. At the entrance of the Hu She, a decorated arch was erected, with a horizontal banner facing Guizhou Road that read, "Memorial Service for Fellow Provincial Wang Yiting." Inside, on both sides, were hung elegiac couplets and mournful poems from various circles. Ascending the steps, one immediately saw a portrait of the late Mr. Wang, inscribed with the four characters "Universal Mourning." Further up was the entrance to the hall, where even more eulogies and elegiac couplets were hung. White silk curtains were draped all around and in the center. In the center of the hall was hung a portrait of the late Mr. Wang, along with the national flag and the party flag. Beside it hung the elegiac couplet from Chairman Chiang, which read, "Amidst the raging storm, his steadfast integrity is even more evident; After restoring order to the universe, we shall mourn this man again." At the front of the hall, on both ends, stood bright lanterns approximately five feet tall, dazzlingly radiant. In front of them were various flower arrangements and potted plants, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Participating Organizations</p>
<p>The organizations participating in the memorial service included: The Shanghai Hu Province Six Counties Association, The Shanghai Huzhou Guildhall, The Zhehu Crepe Industry Association, The Hu She, The Wuxing Silk Weaving Industry Guild, The Wuxing Money Guildhall, The Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce, The Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, The Wuxing Crepe Industry Association, The Wuxing Machine Weaving Industry Association, The Huzhou Shanghai Middle and Primary Schools, The Wuxing Electric Company, The Wuxing Orphanage, The Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Relief Association for Women and Children, The Wuxing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, The Wuxing Cooperative Charity Association, The Hujia Sujia Long-Distance Bus Company, and the Wuxing Crepe Industry Elementary School, etc., totaling eighteen organizations. Representatives including Pan Xulun, Huang Jingwan, Wu Shenbo, Zhou Youjin, Zhou Yueran, Pan Xiangsheng, Wu Zhongxiong, and others, numbered over five hundred people.</p>
<p>Details of the Memorial Service</p>
<p>The presidium consisted of nine people: Pan Xiangsheng, Shen Lianfang, Shen Tianxin, Yan Junxuan, Wen Xuanchen, Zhao Cichen, Shen Yanxiang, Lu Pangzhi, and Zhang Xuren. Pan Xiangsheng presided over the ceremony, and each organization nominated one person to assist. First, Chairman Yan Junxuan delivered a speech, then the presiding officers took their positions, followed by the attendees. Flowers were offered, and then Yan Junxuan reported on Mr. Wang's life and achievements, followed by the reading of the eulogy. Representatives from various organizations, including Wu Dongmai, Wang Yiqun from the Fellow Provincial Association, Niu Zhizi from the Crepe Industry Association, Luo Housheng from the Crepe Industry Elementary School, and Shen Dufu from the Hu She, also spoke. Subsequently, Shen Yanxiang, Wang Dexin, Yu Zhongxian, and others delivered eulogies. Finally, a family representative (son-in-law) Chen Chuanlin gave a speech of thanks.</p>
<p>Bestowing the Title of Minghui</p>
<p>The memorial service resolved to respectfully bestow the posthumous title of "Lord Minghui" to show reverence. The discussion of the posthumous title stated: "Looking back at the regulations established by the Duke of Zhou and the Grand Duke, the purpose of bestowing posthumous titles is to record one's deeds. Actions originate from oneself, and reputation is born from others. Accumulating virtue and performing good deeds leads to a bright reputation that cannot be ignored. After the Qin Dynasty changed the ancient systems, this practice was uniquely discarded. Since the Han Dynasty, adjustments have been made continuously, but it has declined in recent times. As the poem says, 'Lack of virtue goes unrewarded.' How much more so should we encourage goodness and suppress evil, so that the people may thrive and act accordingly? When bright virtue is illuminated, darkness and obscurity will be dispelled. During times of hardship, moral education is crucial. Therefore, it is not appropriate to cease this practice. Thus, Mr. Wang Yiting's virtuous conduct has flourished in the nation, and his benevolence has overflowed into his native region. He was indignant at the arrogance of the invaders, and he threw himself into resisting the enemy. Therefore, the entire region admires his integrity, and the people cherish his virtue, believing that it should not be forgotten. It is appropriate to bestow a posthumous title, which aligns with ancient traditions and does not contradict the sentiments of the people. The posthumous title is not created in vain. After careful consultation, everyone agreed that 'Minghui' (明惠, meaning "bright" and "benevolent") is most suitable. In ancient times, Shu Xiang asked Yan Zi, 'How can a person be said to protect himself?' Yan Zi replied, 'The Book of Songs says, "Being both intelligent and wise, one can protect oneself." Even the benevolent Shu Xiang had such a question. Thus, it is known that without subtle intelligence and wisdom, one cannot speak of this. Mr. Wang was able to uphold his principles amidst great hardship, and he acted upon seeing the signs. He did not travel in an unkempt carriage. The cunning of the Japanese invaders ultimately could not harm him. With the remaining wealth of the bandits, how could one buy the integrity of a good family? Is it not like a tiger with nowhere to use its claws and teeth, or a rhinoceros with nowhere to use its horn? Mr. Wang's integrity firmly placed the Chinese within and the barbarians outside. Feng Meng and Guan Ning lived in Liaodong; what more is there to admire? He can be said to have protected himself. Therefore, bestowing the title of 'Ming' (明, meaning "bright") is most fitting. In the Zhou Dynasty, 'Ming' meant 'illuminating all directions' and 'praising without ceasing.' Neither of these applies to the current situation. These are also the conventions of the Duke of Zhou and the Grand Duke's creation. During the prosperity of the Zhou Dynasty, the disaster of using barbarians to change the customs of China had not yet occurred. Even the sages could not have foreseen this. Mr. Wang's actions should be covered by posthumous title precedents. Xun Qing said, 'There must be adherence to old names, and there must be creation of new names.' Although the actions are different, the titles can be the same. In the Zhou Dynasty, the same name had different meanings, each with its own appropriateness, not limited to a single interpretation. The disaster of the barbarians is extremely urgent today. Thus, distinguishing between the Chinese and the barbarians is 'Ming' (明, meaning "bright"). Intelligent gentlemen should find this acceptable. As for 'Hui' (惠, meaning "benevolent"), it means 'love,' based on the Zhou Dynasty. Mr. Wang often rescued people, showing kindness to widows and orphans. His dedication to universal love is inexhaustible, and the people know it; there is no need to say more. Only benevolence can win people's hearts. Using this to create the posthumous title, and inscribing it on a plain banner, the virtue of kindness and brightness will spread without the need for messengers." Pan Xiangsheng, Yan Junyi, Wu Dongmai, Zhao Cichen, Liu Hanyi, and Cai Weisheng were responsible for sending the posthumous title to the Wang residence. The spirit tablet read (The Honorable Wang Minghui in the Center).</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Mr. Wang</p>
<p>The full text of Mr. Wang Yiting's biography appeared on page 10 of the third section of this newspaper on the 11th of this month. It is omitted here for brevity.</p>
<p>Memorial Oration</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day of the first month of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Hu Province Six Counties Association, the Shanghai Huzhou Guildhall, the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce, the Zhehu Crepe Industry Association, the Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Wuxing Money Guildhall, the Wuxing Crepe Industry Association, the Wu and Silk Weaving Industry Association, the Wuxing Machine Weaving Industry Association, the Wuxing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Relief Association for Women and Children, the Wuxing Cooperative Charity Association, the Wuxing Orphanage, the Hujia Sujia Long-Distance Bus Company, the Wuxing Electric Company, the Wuxing Crepe Industry Elementary School, the Huzhou Shanghai Middle and Primary Schools, and the Hu She, respectfully present this clear wine and humble offerings to the spirit of Fellow Provincial Wang Yiting, saying: Alas, Heaven has not spared us and has prematurely taken away a man of experience and integrity. Like a star falling from the sky, it has shocked everyone far and wide. Oh, Mr. Wang, with your brilliant talents and heroic spirit, your roots were in Tiaoxi (苕溪), and your footsteps were in Zhoupu (周浦). At a young age, your reputation spread far and wide. In the autumn breeze, you honed your skills and displayed your talents. You had a detached and noble spirit, and you were both a writer and a painter, capable and principled. During the late Qing Dynasty, when the seas were opened, you engaged in business and helped restore profits. When the revolutionary army arose, you donated funds to support them, fulfilling the people's hopes in creating the Republic. After achieving success, you retired and devoted yourself to compassion, benefiting people and helping all, spreading to both Chinese and foreigners. Thinking of your fellow provincials, you established the guildhall, a magnificent building where friends often gathered. You gathered funds to establish schools, benefiting future generations, cultivating talents, and winning universal praise. In middle age, you became immersed in Zen Buddhism, returning to the Pure Land, abstaining from killing, releasing animals, and rescuing those in distress. After the Lugouqiao Incident, you were filled with deep concern. You avoided the noise and bustle by going to the South Sea, enjoying leisurely walks. Unfortunately, you caught a cold and returned to Shanghai. Alas, Heaven did not show mercy and took away our elder. The nation has not yet been stabilized, and a pillar has collapsed. The snow monkeys are weeping softly, and the frost geese are crying loudly. Alas, how sad! Mr. Wang's character was a model of ancient virtue, treating people with humility and living with uprightness. We bestow upon you the posthumous title of Minghui and worship you as a local worthy. We look up to you with reverence, our tears flowing silently. Alas, Mr. Wang, your voice and countenance are beyond our reach; who will discuss the affairs of our hometown with us? Public duty and private feelings are both difficult to forget. We respectfully offer this wine and food, and we announce it to your spirit. Please accept our offerings.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Shanghai Municipal Council Issues a Statement Regarding Staff Compensation; The Established Method for Adjusting Exchange Rates Is Not Considered a Salary Increase <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a public statement saying: "The Board of Directors of this Council recently decided on a method to improve staff compensation, which has aroused criticism. There is an apparent misunderstanding about the effects of this method. The Council must first state that the method for adjusting exchange rates as determined in this decision is not a salary increase. If the exchange rate between the British pound and the Chinese national currency falls to one Chinese dollar equaling one shilling, two and three-eighths pence, all allowances will be stopped. The highest basic salary of the main department heads of the Council has in fact been slightly reduced, while their lowest basic salary has been increased slightly."</p>
<p>Calculated Based on the British Pound</p>
<p>Regarding the exchange rate allowance method for "A" category staff (the twenty people consisting of the main department heads, deputy department heads, and other department heads), there are no newly established principles. For many years, one-third of the salaries of these staff members has been calculated based on the British pound. Before this decision by the Council, the minimum exchange rate limit was one Chinese dollar equaling ten and a half pence. If the exchange rate fell below this rate, these staff members would not be able to enjoy the exchange rate allowance they were entitled to. The Council approved the method proposed by the Staff Economic Committee in 1936 when implementing salary reductions, which implicitly granted this allowance. All directors considered this to be the case. The Council's regulations regarding exchange rate allowances set a minimum limit of one Chinese dollar equaling seven pence, with the intention of enabling the Council to re-examine this issue when the exchange rate fell to this limit. The calculation of exchange rate allowances is based on the average exchange rate of the previous month, so each time the exchange rate rises, the amount of the allowance decreases.</p>
<p>One Newly Established Principle</p>
<p>The method established this time contains only one newly established principle, namely that the exchange rate allowance received by the department heads and deputy department heads is greater than that received by other "A" category staff. If the exchange rate is lower than one shilling, two and three-eighths pence, the department heads of the main departments can receive a full allowance on their salaries, and the deputy department heads can receive the same allowance on two-thirds of their salaries. This method seems to have caused a misunderstanding, namely that the salaries of these department heads and deputy department heads have been increased by 100% and 66 and two-thirds percent respectively. This view is actually incorrect, as the basic salaries of these staff members have not been increased. If the exchange rate is one Chinese dollar equaling eight pence, the maximum increase in salary and allowances received by these staff members compared to what they received in December of the previous year is 60%. If the exchange rate rises, the amount of the increase will be reduced.</p>
<p>Establishing Several Positions</p>
<p>In order to maintain the standard level of administration and to be able to hire the necessary personnel, the Council believes it is necessary to establish several positions. The salaries of these personnel, when converted into foreign currency, should be similar to those received by municipal personnel holding the same positions in other major cities around the world. The salaries paid by the Council to senior staff, when converted into foreign currency and compared with those received by staff with the same responsibilities in other organizations, or with those received by staff in some of the larger businesses in this city, are not excessive. There has always been a difference in treatment between "A" grade staff and "B" and "L" grade staff. The salaries of "B" grade staff have always been calculated in Chinese currency. The 15% cost of living allowance determined in this decision has nothing to do with the foreign exchange rate. The Council's intention is to periodically revise the percentage of the allowance based on the level of living expenses.</p>
<p>Reduction in Retirement Savings</p>
<p>Some people believe that the retirement savings provided by the Council will increase with the exchange rate allowance, but in fact, the opposite is true. From January 1st of this year, the retirement savings will be less than before, because since 1937, these savings have been calculated based on the combined amount of the basic salary and the exchange rate allowance, but in the future, they will only be based on the basic salary.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Regular Chinese Army Arrives in Tangkou, Pudong; Japanese Army Panics and Declares Martial Law; Fears of Chinese Attacks Lead to Indiscriminate Firing of Machine Guns <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Three thousand soldiers of the 47th Brigade of the regular Chinese army arrived in Tangkou, Pudong, the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army panicked greatly and immediately declared special martial law. They also blockaded all ports along the South Huangpu River. At night, they indiscriminately fired machine guns in order to create a false show of strength. Cross-river ferries at Xiaodongmen (小東門) and other locations in the South City have not yet resumed operations as of yesterday. The following are the detailed findings of a reporter from the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>Regular Troops Arrive in Tangkou</p>
<p>The three counties of Fengxian (奉賢), Nanhui (南匯), and Chuansha (川沙) in Pudong have long been garrisoned by Chinese guerrilla forces led by Li Zhiming (李志明), Yu Taosheng (于陶生), Ding Xishan (丁錫山), etc., who have frequently launched attacks on the Japanese and puppet forces, causing the Japanese army to feel deeply uneasy and exhausted from constant fighting. However, there have also been some mixed units that have used the name of guerrilla forces to harass the local population, causing suffering to the people. In order to effectively adjust the military affairs in various guerrilla areas, to unify command, to enforce discipline, and to achieve the significant effects of guerrilla tactics, the military authorities have dispatched special commissioners to various areas to implement political training work. In necessary areas, regular troops have also been sent to garrison, in order to coordinate with the original guerrilla forces. It is now known that approximately three thousand soldiers of the 47th Brigade of the regular army have arrived in Tangkou, Pudong, the day before yesterday, led by [name redacted], carrying sophisticated weapons, preparing to coordinate with the guerrilla forces and launch attacks on the Japanese forces at opportune moments.</p>
<p>Japanese Panic and Declare Martial Law</p>
<p>After learning of the above news, the Japanese army felt deeply uneasy and panicked greatly. They immediately declared special martial law from 10:00 AM the day before yesterday along the area from Dongjiadu (董家渡), Bailianjing (白蓮涇) to near Tangkou, and impounded all the small ferries operating in the Punan area at the South Pier of Pudong for inspection. The Sanjiang Maru (三江丸) of the Xieji Transportation Company, which departed from the Bund Copper Man Pier for Longhua (龍華) the day before yesterday, was also detained on its return trip to Shanghai. Many Japanese naval personnel in black uniforms inspected the passengers for as long as four hours, and the ferries were not allowed to depart until 2:00 PM. All cross-river ferries in the South Huangpu area were blockaded, and as of yesterday, except for the South Pier of Pudong, which has been allowed to resume operations, the other cross-river ferries such as Xiaodongmen and Dongjiadu have not yet resumed operations.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Firing of Machine Guns to Create a False Show of Strength</p>
<p>Because the Japanese army feared attacks from the newly arrived regular Chinese army, in addition to declaring special martial law, blockading ferries, and stepping up inspection work, they also indiscriminately fired machine guns in the Tangkou area the night before last for as long as two hours. Residents in the vicinity clearly heard the sound of gunfire, and it only stopped after the Chinese army did not take any action. It is believed that their intention was undoubtedly to create a false show of strength. The Japanese army's self-induced alarm shows the extent of their panic and unease.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Japanese Side Gives Evasive Reply to Tariff Questions; Only One Foreign Debt Repaid After the Signing of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement; Payment of Other Maturing Foreign Debts Postponed Indefinitely <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that at a reception for foreign reporters on Friday (the 13th), a Japanese spokesman answered questions regarding the collection of taxes by the Jianghai Customs, the repayment of foreign debts secured by tariffs, and other issues. The spokesman said that since May 3 of last year, when the British and Japanese authorities reached an agreement on customs issues, the customs revenues in the areas occupied by the Japanese army have been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Of this, a little over one million yuan was paid out last year for the maturing installments of the 1913 Reorganization Loan. Subsequently, because the Chinese government failed to fulfill certain terms stipulated in the agreement, the maturing installments of foreign debts have not been repaid. This is because the Chinese government has not agreed to certain regulations in the agreement requested by the British government. In answering the question of whether the Chinese government approved of this Anglo-Japanese agreement, the spokesman said that it appears that the Chinese government is unwilling to accept the British request to fulfill certain regulations in the agreement. As for the "Reform Government," it has neither withdrawn funds under the tariff heading nor borrowed funds secured by tariffs. When a reporter asked what regulations the Chinese government had not fulfilled, the spokesman replied that one of them was the Chinese government's refusal to repay Japanese loans in the various loans secured by tariffs. The taxes collected from September 1937 to January of last year, before the signing of the agreement, have not been transferred to the Inspector General of Customs in accordance with the terms of the agreement announced in London and Tokyo on May 3. Regarding the amount of tax revenue deposited in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, he did not have this information, and he was also unaware of whether there were 25 million yuan (this figure was cited by a reporter) deposited in HSBC. Regarding the agreement, a certain American reporter stated that this seemed to be a matter between Britain and Japan, so the United States, France, the Netherlands, and other countries were not considered. The spokesman replied that by reading the announcements published in London and Tokyo, one could see that the United States, France, and other countries had not raised any objections. The American reporter continued, "To my knowledge, the United States did not participate in these negotiations and has never agreed to it." The spokesman replied again by suggesting to read the announcements and said that this announcement proves that the United States has not made any objections. The reporter said that the American authorities in Shanghai had stated very clearly that they did not participate in these negotiations and that the maturing installments of American debts had not been paid. In response to this, the spokesman said that he would rather not talk about the points that were not announced when the agreement was signed. The reporter continued that since the signing of the agreement, American debts had not been repaid and that he was now finding out about the status of American debts, that the maturing installments were either deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank by the Japanese side or deposited in HSBC by the British side. The spokesman refused to answer and only said that he had told everything he knew about this issue. The spokesman then denied that Japan had independently repaid 400,000 pounds of overdue British Boxer Indemnity payments that China had not paid. At this point, a certain American reporter said that it seemed that all Japanese debts were secured by the Yokohama Specie Bank, all British debts were secured by HSBC, and the rest of the countries were ignored and could not say a word about it because Britain and Japan had an agreement. The spokesman said that apart from the Reorganization Loan, the maturing installments of other loans had not been paid, and that the reason why the Reorganization Loan was paid was because it was the first maturing installment after the signing of the agreement. As for the payment of funds when the Chinese government did not agree to the terms of the agreement, this was because there were no dealings between the Chinese and Japanese governments, so this payment was made through a third party. A reporter asked that since the maturing installments of one loan had been repaid, why should the payment of maturing installments of other loans be delayed? The spokesman replied that he did not have detailed information about the reason for this, but the payment policy had been changed to await the Chinese government's approval.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Developing the Resources of the Interior; Completing Transportation Infrastructure; Constructing Railways, Improving Highways, and Opening Waterways; Transport Effective; Military Supplies and Relocation Can Be Ensured <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese government, considering that the development of the interior's resources requires the completion of transportation infrastructure, has now constructed the Yunnan-Burma, Sichuan-Kunming, and Yunnan-Myanmar international railways to transport materials, improve highways, facilitate the flow of goods, open new waterways, strengthen transportation, and organize transportation, which has been effective. Expanding aviation to facilitate flight, details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Constructing Railways to Benefit the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Railway construction is a major condition for the War of Resistance, because railways are the largest means of transportation, and the materials required are mostly from abroad, so there must first be a means of transportation for large quantities of railway materials before construction can be discussed. Therefore, the Yunnan-Burma and Sichuan-Kunming railways have been constructed first, opening up international thoroughfares and connecting the economies of Sichuan and Yunnan. Then, the construction of connecting railways in various provinces such as Guizhou-Guangxi and Sichuan-Yunnan will be carried out. Such as: Yunnan-Guizhou Railway, from Guiyang to Kunming, 750 kilometers long; Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, from Chongqing to Guiyang, 600 kilometers long; Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, from Guiyang to Liuzhou, 800 kilometers long; Sichuan-Kangding Railway, from Chengdu to Kangding, 200 kilometers long; Guangxi-Vietnam Line, from Yining to Zhennanguan, 150 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Improving Highways to Facilitate Transportation</p>
<p>The construction of highways is easier than railways, and most of them are earth and stone projects, and the required foreign materials are less. The highways in the southwestern provinces are more developed than those in other provinces. The roads opened to traffic before the war were 27,000 kilometers, accounting for a quarter of the country. The existing road lines are Jiangxi-Yunnan, Sichuan-Guangxi, Guangxi-Fujian, Hunan-Guangxi, Sichuan-Hunan, Sichuan-Yunnan, Guangxi-Yunnan, Sichuan-Hubei, Shaanxi-Kangding, Yunnan-Burma, Guangxi-Vietnam, etc. The above lines are all national trunk lines, and other provincial and county roads are too numerous to mention. The highways in each province can be interconnected. The previous dirt roads have now been repaired. Now, according to the order of the Ministry, purchase additional vehicles to increase the amount of passenger and freight transportation, improve the road surface to allow heavy vehicles to pass, save fuel consumption, increase ferries, build large bridges, and expand repair shops to store and purchase self-made parts.</p>
<p>Opening New Waterways to Promote Cooperation</p>
<p>After the coastal routes were blockaded by the Japanese, the national ships in Beiyang and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were completely forced to stop sailing. Now the government has decided to make full use of inland waterways to facilitate transportation. The main waterways are the Yangtze River, the Xijiang River, the Xiangjiang River, the Guijiang River, the Liujiang River, the Yuanjiang River, etc. New and improved navigation lines in Sichuan, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces will be used in conjunction with highways and railways. Jianglun (江輪) and small boats will be used for transport from the upper streams. Loans are available to add wooden ships to enrich water transport tools. Promote navigation cooperation to improve water transport efficiency. Set up cable stations along dangerous shoals along the river to ensure safe navigation. The Minsheng Company (民生公司), which operates in the upper reaches, has designated 48 ships to operate on the Yichang-Chongqing, Wanxian-Fuling-Chongqing, Chongqing-Luxian-Jiaxing, and Chongqing-Hechuan lines.</p>
<p>Opening International Direct Flight Routes</p>
<p>There are three airline companies: Southwest, China, and Eurasia. China's routes are Chongqing-Chengdu, Chongqing-Kunming, Hong Kong-Hanoi, and Chongqing-Jiaxing. Eurasia's routes are Shaanxi-Hong Kong, Chengdu-Kunming, Chongqing-Hong Kong, and Shaanxi-Chengdu. Southwest's routes are Guangzhou-Hanoi, Guangzhou-Hekou, Guangzhou-Qiongzhou, and Guangzhou-Nanning. The three companies have a total of 12 lines, with a total length of 8,600 kilometers. Now, it has been decided to open international direct flight routes to connect major locations in Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma. At the same time, add airports in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, and increase the night navigation equipment of existing airports to facilitate flight and expand business. Although there have been unfortunate incidents such as the Guilin aircraft, the expansion will not be stopped due to the influence of the war.</p>
<p>Trial Operation of Carrying Has Been Quite Effective</p>
<p>All obstacles such as mountains, deep ravines and other undeveloped areas in the inland areas have to be replaced by human power. Now it has been decided to carry out transportation by carrying, and all the inherent primitive power and tools such as human power, animal power, shoulder carrying, civil boats, and wooden rafts are used as much as possible according to local conditions. Now it is being piloted in the Yibin to Kunming section, and it is estimated that the freight is cheaper than highway transportation, and the amount of transportation can be developed as much as possible without being restricted by modern materials, so it is imperative to universally and vigorously advocate transportation by carrying, so that carts can be seen on the sides of highways in various inland provinces, and groups of carriers can be seen on the roads, so that military supplies and trade migration can be worry-free in the future.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Industry Vigorously Expanded</p>
<p>The telecommunications industry is closely related to the transportation industry, so when the government completes the construction of inland transportation, it will try its best to expand telephones and telegrams. Telegrams: In terms of telegrams with money, speed up the addition of telegraph trunk lines and expand existing single lines. In terms of radio, plan to set up a radio express communication network, increase international radio telegraph direct circuits, and build small radio stations in major cities and adjacent provinces and regions in various border provinces. Telephone: Decide to expand the existing phone lines to form a long-distance telephone system in the southwest and northwest. Connect Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Yangon with inland wireless telephones to communicate with the seaports. Add carrier telephone equipment to the centers of each province. Expand telephone services in major cities.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese puppets dug up the economy and imposed a variety of taxes, not only have merchants increased their burden, but also raised the price of materials, harming the general public. Now, the price of rice in Shanghai has increased due to the sudden reduction in supply after the imposition of heavy taxes, with the highest grade of white rice at 12.56 yuan per picul, and the medium grade at 11.78 yuan, an increase of about 4 jiao per picul compared to the market price three days ago.</p>

<p>— D. L.</p>
<p>(4) Welcoming the Era of Shanghai's Restoration</p>
<p>While the activities of Japanese merchants have been quite prominent, the spirit of hard struggle by national capital is also commendable and moving. To maintain the livelihoods of workers and revive the lifeline of national products, they are all fighting against adversity. Those who moved to the interior have long been mobilized, and many have also moved into the concessions. Some even rely on dilapidated walls and ruins in the border areas of the concessions to revive their businesses. Moreover, those who use all their abilities, regardless of the amount of capital, to find houses and set up factories in the concession areas are also emerging like a storm.</p>
<p>According to a survey (2): The original Chinese-owned yarn factories that have resumed operation include:</p>
<p>Shen Xin No. 2 Factory: 63,884 spindles</p>
<p>No. 9 Factory: 95,616 spindles</p>
<p>Xin Yu No. 1 Factory: 28,060 spindles</p>
<p>No. 2 Factory: 24,920 spindles</p>
<p>Hong Zhang: 30,936 spindles</p>
<p>Yong An No. 3 Factory: 63,180 spindles</p>
<p>Tong Yi: 79,700 spindles</p>
<p>Qin Feng: 4,240 spindles</p>
<p>Da Tong</p>
<p>He Ji: 33,024 spindles</p>
<p>Chong Xin: 34,000 spindles</p>
<p>Total of 11 factories: 456,560 spindles</p>
<p>In addition, many small-scale yarn factories have recently been newly established and are now in operation or about to start.</p>
<p>(Note) Shen Bao, September 27, 1938, stated that those related to British merchants' XXX work include the following:</p>
<p>Yarn spindles (bells)</p>
<p>After all these new factories start operating, Shanghai will have 18 yarn factories producing domestic yarn and cloth, with 534,870 spindles. Although this cannot be compared with the pre-war situation, and in terms of overall national policy, it is unreasonable to be located in the concessions under the current situation. However, for patriotic people in the isolated island: at least there is a possibility of continuing to use domestic products in the future.</p>
<p>(Note) Wu Xinqi's "Adjustment of China's Cotton Industry in Wartime" in the Shanghai Shen Bao Economic Special Issue, October 24, 1938. However, for Shanghai's textile industry to restore its glory in the history of national industry, there are only two paths left:</p>
<p>First: Do not sell yourself for reliance, at least do not recognize a thief as your father. Only then will you not disgrace the reputation of Shanghai's Chinese yarn factories!</p>
<p>Second: Only by welcoming the political and military restoration can Shanghai transcend the sinful environment it is currently in, and also achieve restoration!</p>
<h3 id="e69">Northern Jiangsu Ports Not Blockaded <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Shipping Continues as Usual</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Still Stationed in Original Defenses</p>
<p>Qingshan Maru Only Docks at Qinglong Port</p>
<p>The rumor that the ports of Qidong, Haimen, and other counties in northern Jiangsu have been blockaded by the Japanese is not true. Foreign merchant ships are still sailing as usual. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Qingshan Maru only docks at Qinglong Port. All Chinese troops along the river, after being ordered to adjust their positions, are still stationed in their original defense areas. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Various ships continue to operate to ports north of the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, which are under the jurisdiction of Haimen County, including Songji Port, Niuhong Port, Laohong Port, Hutong Port, Shuji Port, Da'an Port (Qinglong Port, where Japanese troops are stationed), and Lingdian Port. Those under the jurisdiction of Qidong County include Sanhe Port, Dongyihao, and Dongerhao. During the peak period of freight transportation, there were more than a dozen foreign ships sailing to and from these ports. Now, the number has gradually decreased. The rumor that the ports have been blockaded by the Japanese is not true, according to inquiries from the shipping industry and people from Haimen by reporters from the Modern News Agency yesterday. It is now known that British merchants' Hanhe, German merchants' Paide and Haiyi, and Italian merchants' Tangqiao, Deyao, Libei, and Saint Rosie foreign merchant ships are operating as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Only Dock at One Port: Haimen's Qinglong Port. After Japanese troops landed at Qinglong Port in October of last year, the port was used as a military stronghold due to its strategic location, echoing Dasheng No. 3 Factory, which is more than ten miles away from the port. The port is wider, which facilitates communication between the army and navy, so it is easier for the Japanese army to defend. Since the Japanese army was stationed there, commercial transportation has been suspended for a long time, turning it into a dead port. In order to seek development, the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha now sends the Qingshan Maru to operate, and taxes and donations are controlled by the Japanese puppet regime. Merchants and residents of all industries are unwilling to bow down and be oppressed by the enemy. Japanese soldiers take advantage of the name of inspection to loot property, so merchants are very wary. All cargo is loaded and unloaded at other ports. Although Japanese ships have reduced freight rates to attract customers, no one pays attention. Freight transportation is extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Adjusted Defense Positions: The military and administrative work in the guerrilla area of the Eastern Battlefield has been ordered by the central government to the responsible officials and the highest administrative organs in the Sparrow City to handle it properly. All bandit troops who use the guise of guerrillas but actually rely on robbery and seizing territory must be thoroughly eliminated. The complete disarmament of Zhou Fang's troops in Qidong is an example of this. Chinese troops in northern Jiangsu have contacted the regular army and reorganized. At the end of last year, thousands of Japanese and puppet troops harassed Qihai and were severely attacked by the Chinese troops, resulting in many casualties on both sides. However, the Japanese army was eventually driven out. All Chinese troops gathered from various inland areas have been adjusted and stationed at their original ports. If they dare to invade, they will be severely suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Total Trade Volume of the Jianghai Customs in 1938 Showed a Deficit of 46.91 Million Yuan. Trade Recovered to the First Position Starting in June Last Year. <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The total trade of Jianghai Customs last year (1938) was 26,909,235 yuan for imported foreign goods and 22,218,1071 yuan for exported local goods. The total value of imports and exports was 49,127,3386 yuan, with a deficit of 46,911,244 yuan. At the beginning of its duties, Jianghai Customs lost its leading position in the country due to the shift of the entire trade center inland, resulting in a decline in both imports and exports. Since June of last year, trade has gradually recovered to the first position due to the restoration of inland transportation and the increase in population in the concessions. However, Japanese goods still accounted for the majority of imported foreign goods, decreasing by about half compared to the previous year. During the same period of the previous year, imports were 50,884,4132 yuan and exports were 40,439,5418 yuan. Jianghai Customs used to be the only port with a trade deficit, but after the competent authorities took measures to eliminate it, it decreased by 57,537,470 yuan last year compared to the previous year. Last year, candles, soap, oil, wax, glue, and rosin accounted for the first place in imported foreign goods, followed by gold and mineral sands. Animals and animal products accounted for the first place in exported local goods, followed by textiles.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Materials Stolen from the China Merchants Electric Company are Worth 500,000. After the Power Plant Was Forcibly Occupied, Electricity Was Generated Without Permission. <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Original Workers Deeply Understand the Situation and Firmly Refuse to Work.</p>
<p>The Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company is the only important enterprise in the urban area. Since the fall of Shanghai, the internal wealth-generating materials have been stolen. Recently, the "China Central Water and Electricity Company" forcibly seized the power plant, recruiting ignorant workers to work there. The original workers deeply understand the situation and firmly refuse. The reporter from the Modern News Agency learned the following from the relevant parties:</p>
<p>Hardware Materials Stolen</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company has moved its important documents to the HSBC Building on the Bund. All offices, workshops, and factories of the Nanshi Company were completely sealed. When the National Army moved west and Nanshi was occupied by the Japanese army, the Zhilan unit was stationed at the Nanshi Mulaishui Factory, and guards were stationed at the old and new factory gates of the China Merchants Electric Company. On one hand, they colluded with Japanese hooligans to move away the wealth-generating materials from the China Merchants Electric Company's lighting, technology, transportation, and engineering offices. The three lathes, two drilling machines, twelve vices, and more than twenty motors in the car factory's repair department, ten sets of electrical equipment, dozens of car wheels, as well as wire, electrical materials, copper, iron, tin, and various hardware, totaling more than 500,000 yuan, were all stolen.</p>
<p>Unauthorized Power Generation Damages Boilers</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese puppet regime has been inducing the China Merchants Electric Company to cooperate in order to seize the water and electricity business, but they were severely rejected. The puppet organization then forcibly occupied the property of the seven major water and electricity plants and sent personnel from the "China Central Water and Electricity Company" to take over. On one hand, they recruited ignorant workers to work in the Nanshi Power Plant and actually generated electricity. However, because these workers lacked technical knowledge, all the boilers were burned out and are now unusable. The Japanese are sending personnel to repair them.</p>
<p>Original Workers Firmly Refuse to Work</p>
<p>Because the new workers lacked technical skills and suffered major damage to the power generation work, the Japanese puppet regime sent many traitors last month to win over the old workers of the China Merchants Electric Company, enticing them with high salaries and instructing them to work. However, all the workers deeply understood the situation. Although they had been unemployed for a long time and their lives were precarious, they were able to maintain their integrity for the sake of the whole country and refused to enter the factory to work.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Two More Batches of Jewish Refugees Arrive. The Committee is Preparing a Building to Move All Refugees In. <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that yesterday (the 14th), a person in charge claimed that two more batches of Jewish immigrants, totaling 250 people, arrived in Shanghai today (the 14th). The problem of taking care of these immigrants has become increasingly serious. There are now 1,500 Jewish refugees in Shanghai, of which only 20% can support themselves. Sir Sassoon's donation of 1.5 million yuan for rehabilitation has slightly alleviated the difficulties, and many immigrants have gained new hope in their lives. However, this fund is specifically designated to assist immigrants in engaging in business, as the committee believes that assisting refugees in rehabilitation is the most appropriate way to deal with the refugee relief problem and avoid difficulties in finding jobs in this city. Temporarily maintaining the minimum accommodation for immigrants in Shanghai requires about 90,000 yuan per month, but this amount has not yet been fully raised, so the living conditions of the newly arrived immigrants are quite pitiful. In order to improve this situation, several large buildings have been taken over in the Huishan and Hongkou districts, and they are being renovated. It is hoped that all the refugees can be moved into them in the short term, and then a centralized food distribution system will be started, which can further reduce expenses. The former Customs Training School opposite the Xilao in Huade Road is the largest of the buildings. After renovation, it can accommodate 1,200 people and is expected to be ready for the refugees to move in within two weeks.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief and Fundraising Committee for Refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai, held a meeting on January 15, with Xia Guoshun, Yang Meinan, Li Ze, Guo Zhongliang, Pan Zhiquan, Cui Pingxi, Chen Qifen, Chen Qiluo, Jiang Hechun, and others.</p>
<p>More than 200 people</p>
<p>First, Xia Guoshun, the vice chairman of the committee, delivered an opening speech, saying that today is the general meeting of all fundraising committee members of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief and Fundraising Committee for Refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai. Thank you all for your enthusiastic participation and support. After the "August 13th Incident", the fellow villagers in this city suffered terribly, but after the outbreak of the war in South China, the fellow villagers in Guangdong and Guangxi,</p>
<p>Suffered Even More Terribly</p>
<p>It is hoped that fellow villagers from all walks of life will generously donate and work hard to raise funds, so that the refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi will benefit greatly. He then said that Mr. Feng Bingnan, the chairman of the committee, was unable to attend due to illness, but had submitted a letter of declaration for the conference, which contained more than 2,000 words, and was earnest and deeply concerned about this matter. It was decided that Cui Pingxi, the director of the design department of the committee, would report on the</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>It was briefly stated that when the committee held its inaugural meeting at Mr. Feng Bingnan's residence on December 13 last year, more than 10,000 yuan had been pledged on the spot. Now, according to the industry, it is divided into 26 groups, including groups for organizations, finance, department stores, and education, to raise funds separately, and 18 collection agencies have been set up in various districts of the city. It is hoped that fellow villagers from all walks of life will</p>
<p>Work Hard to Raise Funds</p>
<p>Afterwards, more than ten people, including Tan Rongtuan, Jiang Hechun, Guo Zhongliang, Li X, Chen Qihao, Situ Wei, Lu Songqian, and Xu Songshi, delivered speeches one after another. The atmosphere in the entire venue was extremely enthusiastic. The results of the fundraising in the future are bound to be impressive.</p>

<p>Ding Xisan, the commander of the Third Detachment of the Patriotic Salvation Army of the Guerrilla Unit in Southern Pudong, showed with his leadership that the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War emphasizes guerrilla warfare. The progress in the future necessarily requires innovation and the training of cadres to cultivate new forces. A cadre training class was specially held in the headquarters of this unit to recruit ambitious young people to train in guerrilla tactics and instill political knowledge, so as to achieve unity between the military and the people. The opening ceremony was held at a certain place on New Year's Day. Commander Ding, Director He of the Political Department, and other instructors attended the ceremony to explain the purpose of the opening class. More than 100 students attended the class. Classes began the next day. Once the training is completed, they will be assigned to various units to enrich the lower-level cadres and promote the Anti-Japanese War.</p>

<p>The Continental News reported that the sailing ship Meiling was owned by an American. It set off from Wenzhou, intending to cross the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. A few days later, it encountered a storm and was forced to dock near a certain Japanese naval base on Boko Island (transliteration), where it was arrested by the local Japanese authorities. The American Consulate in this city received yesterday (the 14th) 400 yen and three wooden boxes sent from the island, containing five cameras belonging to the ship's captain, Mr. Nichols, and his crew. As for Mr. Nichols and his crew, after detailed investigation and questioning by the Japanese side, they have been sent back to Shanghai. The ship Meiling was already broken. The hull was collected by local fishermen, and sundries were salvaged and publicly auctioned. The 400 yen is the proceeds from the sale.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Domestic Factories Should Apply for Domestic Goods Certificates as Soon as Possible. Merchants Selling Goods Should Recognize the Quality. If it Does Not Meet the Standards, it Should be Reported Secretly. <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The rules for the issuance of domestic goods certificates by the Ministry of Economic Affairs were revised and promulgated in September 1938. Among them, regarding the standards for domestic goods, it is stipulated that domestic factories using foreign capital, foreign raw materials, and foreign engineers are generally not recognized as domestic goods during wartime if they belong to the enemy. If a factory that has already obtained a certificate changes its organization, resulting in it not meeting the requirements of the domestic goods standard, its certificate should be revoked. Regarding the review of domestic goods, a special committee of 30 to 50 people will be set up within the review committee, recommended by local industrial and commercial organizations and then appointed. The task of these special committee members is to answer inquiries, provide opinions, and report on domestic goods factories. In the future, the review and certification of domestic goods will inevitably become more complete. Compatriots at home and abroad who have factories should apply for certificates in accordance with the rules as soon as possible if their products meet the standards of domestic goods, so that they can be sold. Those who sell domestic goods as their main business should pay attention to whether the products they sell are domestic goods that have obtained certificates. If it is found that there are goods that have changed in quality and do not meet the standards, they must report the facts to the government at any time to revoke their certificates.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Japanese Troops and Japanese Goods Occupying Four Warehouses Show Signs of Withdrawal. The Marine Corps at the New Warehouse Has Withdrawn, and Goods from the Three Warehouses Have Begun to Be Moved. <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The New Warehouse and Chinese Warehouse in Pudong, and the Central Warehouse and North Warehouse in Hongkou of the American-owned Velely &amp; Company, were all in the war zone. After the war moved west, they were suddenly occupied by the Japanese army. The New Warehouse was filled with food and horse feed, the Central Warehouse housed wounded soldiers and stored food, and the North Warehouse stored ammunition. All four warehouses were used for military purposes. During the spring of this year, the authorities of the Weilihan Company requested to take over in the capacity of property owners, but the Japanese side once expressed objections. A year has passed, and it has recently been heard that one company of the Japanese Marine Corps originally stationed in the new warehouse in Yangjiadu, Pudong, had completely withdrawn from the warehouse the day before yesterday and moved to the third battalion headquarters of the Customs Warehouse at Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui. However, the floor of the new warehouse and some of the existing goods have been dismantled and removed. Four floating wharves along the Pudong shore were also dismantled and dragged to Yangshupu by the Japanese army. Therefore, only a few empty houses remain in the new warehouse. The goods stored in the Chinese Warehouse, Central Warehouse, and North Warehouse have also begun to be moved.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Great Fire in Changsha, as Described by an Eyewitness, Refugees Suffered Greatly, Mr. Hoskins' Talk <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that Dr. Hoskins, a representative of the American trustees of Xiangya University in Changsha and an eyewitness to the great fire in Changsha, arrived in Shanghai recently. Yesterday (the 14th), he told reporters that after the great fire in Changsha in November, the rubble has now been cleared, and 70,000 to 100,000 people have returned to the city. Relief programs are also underway, but the most tragic suffering of the people of Changsha has not yet arrived. When they fled the city, they all</p>
<p>Slightly Carried Silver and Thread</p>
<p>The government also allocated huge sums of money to temporarily maintain them, but now it has been exhausted. In the next few months of winter, they may suffer the most profound suffering. Mr. Hoskins also talked about the great fire in Changsha, saying that he passed through Changsha on the afternoon of November 12, the day before the fire. He saw no more than twelve people in the entire city. He returned to Changsha that night, and people fled to the suburbs. A great fire broke out that night, and some people were awakened from their sleep, wearing thin clothes and hurrying to escape. As a result of the fire, Changsha was burned down</p>
<p>Three-Quarters</p>
<p>But it is surprising that so few people died in the fire. It is believed that most people had been warned in advance. The day after the fire, only one wounded person was brought to Xiangya Hospital, who was a gambler and was injured when the roof collapsed and hit him. Only then did he realize that there was a great fire. Xiangya's property was all in the suburbs, so it was not affected. Mr. Hoskins also said that Xiangya was not, as rumored, "outside the city", because the city walls of Changsha had been demolished for eighteen years. Relief work in Changsha is being handled by the local International Committee, which is trying to enable people to return to Changsha and intends to implement the following within three days:</p>
<p>Relief Work: Those who return to the city will be given soft loans, but they must be repaid. This will not only make the recipients know how to cherish them, but also allow them to lend this fund to others in the future. Industrial projects have already started, with women engaged in the manufacture of soap and cloth. 60 women have now been employed. 60 workers will be taught weaving skills by experts and trained for a month. When their skills are proficient, they will be given adequate loans as capital for self-reliance in the weaving industry. Soft loans are particularly effective in Hunan Province. A few years ago, the International Red Cross had</p>
<p>Tried Loan</p>
<p>The result was quite satisfactory. Diseases are rampant around Changsha, and doctors have already encountered many difficulties. It costs several yuan to treat one patient with malaria using the least amount of quinine. The cost of treating the spread of malaria is enormous. The International Red Cross uses the funds to subsidize hospitals and provide medical supplies to fundamentally assist medical work. The 70,000 to 100,000 people who have now returned to the city are all the</p>
<p>Poorest Class</p>
<p>After the fire, the government immediately allocated huge sums of money for relief. Fortunately, many people are engaged in small businesses, but there is no large-scale commerce. Four primary schools have been set up in the city to provide medical care for poor children, with about 300 students. The people of Changsha are about to suffer the most tragic suffering. Relief work is most urgently needed in the coming winter months.</p>

<p>Han Baolin, a 21-year-old Danyang native who lives at No. 6, Lane 1316, Xinzha Road and works as a tailor, lured Qiu Feng, a 15-year-old adopted daughter of his neighbor Xu Dehong from the same village, on the 10th of this month to a certain hotel at No. 1, Lane 231, Albury Road in the French Concession for rape. After Xu Dehong reported the girl's disappearance to the Gaobian Road Police Station, Chinese detective Xu Gengrong investigated the matter and arrested Han at the tailor shop at No. 6, Xinzha Road, at 2 p.m. on the day of the incident. He went to No. 1, Albury Road in the French Concession to search for Xu but found nothing. He was then taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer, applied for a family trial on behalf of the defendant. The defendant's testimony was hesitant. Judge Huang ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhang Haiming, a Cheduo native from Xiaoshazhi, Binlang Road, lost his eight-year-old daughter Gendi, and Wang Delong, a Jiangbei native from No. 99 Yanping Road, lost his eleven-year-old daughter Luo Xiaoerzi, around 2 p.m. on December 31 last year, while playing on the street nearby. They were lured away by bandits and disappeared. The case was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which was in charge of investigating cases of kidnapping. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chinese Detective Wei Hanpo received a report from an informant that Gendi and Sao Xiao's son were found in the residence of a Wan woman, Zhang Wu, at No. 918, Dongqingli, Louye Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went there in the afternoon and arrested the female bandit, Si Yijue, Wu Luanhu, Hu Yuteng. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant said at the police station that the two girls were brought and fostered by Hao Yang, a fellow villager who was on the run, and were given 30 yuan for food and porcelain. His words are true and commendable. It is not known. Now that the parents of the two girls have arrived in court, the supply line is hesitant. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be detained again for further investigation. The girls Zhang Xiaodi and Luo Xiaoerzi are allowed to be taken back by Zhang Haiming and Wang Delong.</p>

<p>Since the evacuation from Shanghai’s factory areas and the westward movement of the National Army, the Yangshupu area beyond Hongkou and Yingkou cannot be fully open. Many factory owners, in their haste to evacuate, left behind heavy machinery essential for production and attracting capital. Taking advantage of this situation, numerous vagrants infiltrated these two districts, engaging in theft to make a living and selling stolen goods for daily sustenance. Recently, a man named He Sanda stole a rolling mill worth two hundred yuan from a machinery factory at No. 772 Dong Youzhi Road. He transported it near Gongping Road, where he was interrogated by Zhang Jiansheng, a Chinese detective of the Lushun Police Station, and detectives Li Zhaozhao and Sai Jue, who discovered that the item was stolen. They immediately arrested him, along with the rolling mill, and took him to the police station. The detectives investigated the owner of the machinery factory but could not locate his new residence. Subsequently, they apprehended Xu Agao, an accomplice of He Sanda, and handed them over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, a clerk at the police station, explained the situation and requested an extension of the detention, stating that the factory owner would be brought to the station to identify the stolen goods. Following Zhang Yunsheng's report detailing the case's progress, the presiding judge, Mr. Huang Risheng, found the defendants’ testimonies evasive and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>Many Chinese people suffer from stomach ailments, often enduring years of excruciating pain. Those with chronic conditions often accept it as a natural habit, paying no attention to it. However, the stomach is vital for nourishment and cannot be ignored. Stomach ailments can range from mild stomach "sluggishness" to severe food intolerance. Reduced nutrient absorption can negatively impact overall health, leading to muscle loss, weakened resistance, and susceptibility to various diseases. Even those who understand the importance of nutrition may suffer for years due to a lack of effective treatment. Fortunately, there is a "One Seven Zero Wan Stomach Medicine," which can instantly relieve stomach pain within minutes. Once taken, the ailment vanishes as if it never existed. Users are amazed by its miraculous effect. This medicine can fundamentally cure gastritis, stomach ulcers, tumors, stomach cancer, and stomach dysfunction, alleviating symptoms such as chest and abdominal distension, aversion to food, belching, acid reflux, chest pain, easy satiety or hunger, and irregular bowel movements. It can instantly cure new ailments and bring sudden relief to old ones. It not only provides temporary pain relief but also offers a fundamental cure. This medicine is a renowned secret formula, repeatedly tested and proven effective by various large steel chicken pearl embellishments,孙着筒效.

<p>In the frigid winter, when the words "Ruyi Ling Frostbite Pearl" are mentioned, hands, feet, and exposed parts of the body are prone to frostbite. Although not a major illness, the pain is excruciating and makes walking difficult. It can last for a long time, and if left untreated, the affected area may ulcerate, which is difficult to heal until spring. Moreover, the scars left behind are unsightly, which is particularly distressing for young women. People often dismiss this as insignificant, and effective remedies are rare. Zhengxun Gravel Modification has created two types of medication at the intersection of Yinhua Street and Yima Road to meet the urgent needs of winter: (1) "Frostbite Ruyi Water," specifically for treating non-ulcerated frostbite, whether it is recent or has been present for days. It provides instant pain relief upon application, reduces redness and swelling on the same day, and prevents ulceration. For long-standing, ulcerated frostbite, there is (2) "Pearl White Deep Paste," used to promote skin regeneration and heal the affected area in a short period. Those suffering from frostbite should not hesitate and use it immediately. The price of "Frostbite Ruyi Water" is 25 cents per bottle, and "Pearl White Deep Paste" is 40 cents per box.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Winter Tonics, Cod Liver Oil Sees Strong Sales, "Weiling" Brand Particularly Active <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Since the onset of winter in Shanghai, sales of tonics have steadily increased, and due to the large-scale war, sales have exceeded those of previous years. According to investigations, "Weiling" brand cod liver oil preparations are particularly well-suited to the current climate and are experiencing robust sales. There are two types of tonics: positive and negative. Seeking tonics after falling ill and experiencing physical deficiencies, in order to restore one's original health, is considered negative tonification. On the other hand, taking precautions and strengthening the body to enhance its ability to resist disease is considered positive tonification. The proverb says, "Better to prepare than to repair," meaning it is better to "return and suddenly trick" than to "burn your head off". However, the nutritional value of rice, wheat, fish, and vegetables varies, and the physical strength of individuals can differ significantly. Scientists believe that this is due to a deficiency of vitamins in the body. Therefore, in the cold winter, a highly nutritious tonic is essential. Experts recognize cod liver oil as the superior choice. However, the cod liver oil produced in the northern countries and imported to our country varies in quality among different manufacturers, and the speed of efficacy also differs.

<h3 id="e109">New Trends in National Vocational Education After the War (Continued) <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>(4) Holding Summer Seminars for Teachers of Agricultural Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Agricultural education in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces urgently needs guidance and promotion. The Ministry of Education will convene principals and chief teachers of public and private agricultural vocational schools in these provinces at the Agricultural College of National Central University in Chongqing during this summer vacation to hold summer seminars. The seminars will be divided into three groups: agronomy, forestry, and horticulture, with a duration of six weeks. More than thirty schools with a total of over fifty students will participate.</p>
<p>(5) Subsidizing Excellent Vocational Schools</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has allocated 140,000 yuan from the central production education funds for the 27th year to be used to reward and advance excellent public and private vocational schools in various provinces. The principle of subsidization is mainly to assist industrial vocational schools in enriching mechanical equipment, followed by agriculture and medical affairs. A total of thirteen schools have been subsidized, including five schools in Sichuan Province, one school in Guizhou Province, three schools in Yunnan Province, one school in Guangxi Province, one school in Hunan Province, one school in Shaanxi Province, and one school in Gansu Province. At the same time, the provincial and municipal governments are ordered to provide equal subsidies.</p>
<p>(6) Inspecting Agricultural and Industrial Education in the Southwest and Northwest Provinces</p>
<p>In order to promote secondary agricultural and industrial education in the southwest and northwest provinces, the Ministry of Education, in addition to holding seminars for agricultural teachers, has also selected personnel with rich knowledge and experience in agricultural and industrial education, such as Ye Fangzhe, Wang Wenzhong, Yu Zhisong, Zhang Pijie, Tang Zhicai, and An Shinong, to go to various provinces for inspection, guidance, and improvement.</p>
<p>(7) Stipulating Registration Methods for Technical Personnel</p>
<p>In order to meet urgent needs, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to various provinces and designated schools to run various vocational training classes to train middle and lower-level cadres and technical personnel. However, due to the lack of qualified technical personnel in the teaching staff to serve as instructors, six methods for registering technical personnel in various industries have been specifically formulated in various cities, with a deadline for implementation. The registers will be submitted to the Ministry for selection of talents. At the same time, public and private vocational schools are ordered to list the qualifications, experience, and expertise of all vocational subject teachers and submit them for overall planning.</p>
<p>(8) Investigating Local Farmers' Experience</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that improving agricultural education should first focus on practice and eliminate the past abuses of mere formality. Therefore, it has decided to first investigate the good experience accumulated by farmers in various places over thousands of years, and then integrate it with modern agricultural science, to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The scope of the investigation includes eleven categories: 1. Farmland water conservancy, 2. Forests, 3. Crops, 4. Fruit tree cultivation, 5. Forest nursery sowing, 6. Vegetable cultivation, 7. Agricultural product manufacturing, 8. Popular climate prediction, 9. Farm implements, 10. Livestock, 11. Livestock diseases, etc. The investigation items have been specified, the forms have been prepared, and they have been distributed to agricultural schools in various provinces and cities for thorough investigation.</p>
<p>National Central Vocational School of Industry</p>
<p>The new school buildings have not yet been completed and are currently under construction. It is expected that most of them will be completed within this month. More than 340 new and old students started classes as early as the end of October last year, and their morale is still good. The National Central Midwifery School has found a location for the maternity hospital and is under construction. It is expected to be completed by the end of February. The school is running smoothly, and there are many outpatients and pregnant women admitted to the hospital. The National Central Nursing School is temporarily running in Guizhou Province. It is now planned to set up a branch school in Sichuan Province to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Medical Education</p>
<p>Including midwifery and nursing education, it has recently attracted the attention of the general public. In addition to the one school directly run by the central government, a new school has been established in Sichuan Province. In addition, border provinces such as Xikang are also planning to add schools this year. As for the existing schools in various places, the Ministry of Education intends to send personnel to inspect them in the near future and actively urge them to enrich and improve. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e110">School Overview: Zhang's Guoxue (National Studies) Lecture Series <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Zhang's Guoxue Lecture Series was founded by Zhang Taiyan, a master of Guoxue, with the aim of studying inherent culture and cultivating Guoxue talents. It was established in April 1935, and its venue was built on Jinfan Road in Suzhou. It is divided into two departments: lectures and scripture reading. In addition to Mr. Zhang personally giving lectures, the lecturers include Mr. Zhang's top student Zhu Xizu and more than 20 others. Many students come from afar, about 200 people. The formal course of study is limited to two years, and the journal *Zhiyan* (Words of Wisdom) is published semi-monthly, with Mr. Zhang himself serving as the chief editor, and Pan Chengbi, Shen Yanguo, and Sun Shiyang serving as editors. Zheng Weiye served as the general affairs officer. All the articles published are Guoxue essays, which are well received by scholars at home and abroad. In the summer of 1936, Mr. Zhang passed away. Mrs. Zhang Taiyan, Tang Guoli, took on the important task of continuing the lectures in order to pass on the teachings. In order to expand the school, a board of directors was organized, inviting Mr. Zhang's lifelong friends Yu Youren, Li Genyuan, Shen Enfu, Shen Zumiian, Ju Zheng, Bai Wenwei, Ma Xiangbo, Ma Junwu, Chen Taoyi, Zhang Ji, Zhang Zhiben, Zhang Yi, Zhang Junli, Zhang Dongsun, Feng Ziyou, Yang Shukan, Yang Pusheng, Deng Bangshu, Deng Jiayan, Ye Chuqiang, Jiang Zuobin, Jiang Weiqiao, Chu Fucheng, and Han Guojun to serve as directors.

They then raised funds and jointly determined the course of action. The regular courses continued to be lectured, and in addition to continuing to print *Zhiyan* semi-monthly, a preparatory course was added. Mr. Zhang's old friends Wang Xiaoxu and Shen Diemin, etc., and more than 20 of Mr. Zhang's top students were invited to give lectures. The school's expenses were 10,000 yuan per year, which was donated by Mr. Zhang privately, so the students were all free of charge. The first class of regular and preparatory students graduated. The school was about to expand when the war broke out, Suzhou fell, and the school was suspended. Now the directors and members of the board of directors are meeting in Shanghai to jointly plan the restoration of the school, add additional directors such as Yin Yin, Xu Langxi, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zhiming, and Xiang Longxun, and jointly elect Ma Xiangbo as the chairman of the board of directors. The internal organization is divided into three departments: the Research Department, the *Zhiyan* Society, and the Taiyan College of Literature and its affiliated middle school.

<h3 id="e114">International Cup Football Semi-Final: Hualian Suffers Crushing Defeat; Loses 5-0; Portugal Gains Final Rights <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was warm as spring. The International Cup football semi-final between Hualian and Portugal kicked off at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan. No less than seven thousand people, attracted by the fame, watched from the sidelines, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Hualian still fielded the same lineup that defeated England, but the loss of the central defense line led to a lack of coordination in attack and defense. Goalkeeper Zhou Dayun was in poor form yesterday and gifted at least three goals. Central defender Xu Chenghun's inability to contain the fierce Fafanxiao was also a major reason for the defeat. The Portuguese team's lineup was indeed very strong, with Fafanxiao, Corassa, and Rocha Liao in front, and Ma Shan'er, Weiketai, and Kaositan coordinating in the middle. Although Hualian had "Iron Leg," Ade, and Yichen, they could not take one step over the Lei Pool. With few opportunities to score, and even those being off target, a one-sided situation was formed. In the first half, the Portuguese team took the lead with a score of 1-0. In the end, Hualian lost five goals, shocking all seven thousand fans. Now that Hualian has been惨惨 eliminated, this year's cup will be a battle between Portugal and the Soviet Union. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Portugal:</p>
<p>Rocha Liao</p>
<p>Ma Shan'er, Weiketai'ao</p>
<p>V Su Ruo, Kaositan, Lie Weila</p>
<p>C Lei Mide, I Rocha Liao, Fafanxiao, Corassa, L Lei Mide</p>
<p>Hualian Team:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun</p>
<p>Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen</p>
<p>Meng Yiliang, Xu Chenghun, Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua, Li Qunchen, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Dayun Panicked and Lost the First Goal</p>
<p>As the whistle blew to start the match, the Portuguese team attacked first but failed. "Iron Leg" passed to Xiao Wan, and Xiao Wan tried his toe, but it was caught and thrown out by goalkeeper Rocha Liao. Xiao Wan sent it remotely, and Ma Shan'er stumbled, but Sun "Iron Leg" was a step late, to no avail. Youliang assisted Ade in attacking the goal but was blocked. Xiao Wan rushed in from the left and hooked the ball to the center, Ade yielded to "Iron Leg," who was blocked by Ma Shan'er, and kicked the ball high, over the crossbar. After Corassa's shot went wide, Jia Youliang killed past Lao Ma, but "Iron Leg's" toe was ineffective, and it was all in vain. The Portuguese team, having repeatedly survived dangerous situations, took the opportunity to attack. Lao Si passed remotely in front of the goal, and C Lei Mide rushed up, but was saved by Dayun. L Rocha Liao and I Lei Mide advanced side by side, and Meng Yiliang blocked them into a corner kick. Fafanxiao took the corner, and Rocha Liao headed it to the back, then returned to his feet and shot powerfully at the goal from fourteen yards. Dayun panicked, caught it and then lost it, and it rolled into the corner of the goal, opening the scoring. This was exactly twenty minutes after the start of the match. The Portuguese team attacked again, and the Hualian penalty area was full of danger. Kaositan and Fafanxiao headed in succession, but both were ineffective. Xiao Wan's hook shot missed, and Ade and Yichen also tried headers, one being blocked and the other going over the crossbar. Then, Xiao Wan received a pass from Youliang and swept across the goal, but A Rocha Liao dived and turned it into a corner kick. Hualian failed to score repeatedly, and the first half ended with a score of 0-1.</p>
<p>A Thousand Miles Lost; Hualian Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>As the second half began, C Lei Mide's shot was caught. Xiao Wan advanced but was blocked by Ma Shan'er and retreated. Then the ball was passed out from Hualian's territory again. After several passes, the entire Portuguese team advanced outwards. Weiketai defended the rear. Sun "Iron Leg" got a one-on-one opportunity and poked the ball into the net, but the referee had already blown the whistle, judging a foul by the Portuguese team. It was all for naught. Hualian suffered this setback, and morale was depressed. Su Ruo sent remotely to Corassa, who shot powerfully, but it hit the goal and bounced out, a very dangerous moment. Hualian counterattacked, but Yichen's shot went wide again. Then the Portuguese team launched another fierce attack, and the Hualian goal area was in danger again. Kaositan remotely tapped, but it was caught. Li Yichen dribbled out and passed to Ade, who poked it in the middle. Sun dodged, intending to let Youliang shoot, but Ma Shan'er rushed out and snatched it away. After fifteen minutes, the Portuguese team got a corner kick opportunity. C Lei Mide's corner was very good, and Fafanxiao volleyed from twelve yards, hitting the net. (2-0) Then Youliang's left-footed shot went askew. Meng Yiliang suddenly fouled, and Olivilai took a free kick from thirty yards. The ball flew towards the goal, and Dayun jumped up and missed, but Zhang Lingen saved the dangerous situation. One wave had not subsided, and another rose. At twenty-three minutes, Fafanxiao got the ball and hooked it from the right of the goal. The ball was fast and steep, and Dayun repeated the mistake of the first goal, sliding into the net. (3-0) Yichen and Xiao Wan exchanged positions after this, but still made no progress. At thirty-eight minutes, Kaositan passed to C Lei Mide, who hooked it to Rocha Liao, who passed it to Corassa, who scored with one kick (4-0). Not five minutes later, also Rocha Liao shot from the left of the goal, and Dayun did not make a save, letting it roll into the corner of the goal. Time ran out, and Hualian suffered a crushing defeat of 0-5. The Portuguese team won the right to the final.</p>

<p>The Secret to a Long and Happy Marriage</p>
<p>The wedding night is the happiest event in one's life. However, if both husband and wife do not have healthy bodies, it can often lead to great tragedy, causing lifelong misfortune. Therefore, a person must be careful at all times from being unmarried to getting married. The first thing to pay attention to in daily hygiene is to absolutely maintain virginity before marriage.</p>
<p>Many ignorant young people think that keeping virginity before marriage is the sole responsibility of women, and that men have almost no need to bear this obligation. This absurd prejudice is indeed the main cause of post-marital tragedies.</p>
<p>It is true that men are more promiscuous before marriage than women who do not observe chastity before marriage. Masturbation can be said to be the starting point of male promiscuity. After excess, the essence is exhausted and the brain is drained. Not only do annoying wrinkles appear early on his face, he loses the plumpness of his appearance, and his physique becomes weaker, but his reproductive function rapidly declines, and he heads down the path of premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and neurasthenia, making his future life endlessly miserable!</p>
<p>Some people say that married life is conducive to health. Their research shows that married people have fewer illnesses and lower mortality rates than single and widowed people. However, please do not misunderstand, the married life mentioned in the previous section refers to those who can maintain their virginity before marriage and engage in regular reproductive processes after marriage. If one is promiscuous before marriage and indulges in lust after marriage, then health after marriage will disappear even more quickly, presenting a premature aging phenomenon, with weak kidneys, reproductive dysfunction, and a gradual decrease in the heat of love. Lifespans are shortened, and there are many who sacrifice all sorts of bright futures because of marriage.</p>
<p>Good health is the mother of all successful careers. This is a truly wise saying, because happiness and love between husband and wife after marriage cannot escape this rule either. Although a fulfilling and happy marriage depends entirely on many successful factors, such as matching interests, sufficient property, harmonious temperament, and a comfortable environment, abundant energy is indeed the most important factor. Because after having abundant energy, one has a strong physique and a ruddy complexion on the outside, and sufficient wisdom and liveliness on the inside. In short, a healthy man is better than a weak man at protecting his family and enhancing the love between husband and wife. Of course, in fact, it cannot be said that there are no cases of men accidentally falling in love with low-ability women, and women being attracted to men who have lost their health due to material inducements, but these are errors in love, not the ideals of love. They will regret it once they discover these errors. Therefore, instead of regretting it afterwards, it is better to take "Biotecum," a German testicular essence preparation for men to promote metabolism and enhance reproductive function. It has miraculous effects within 24 hours after taking it for premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. If you feel that your essence and blood are deficient after marriage, one dose will cure you, guaranteeing lasting love and a long and happy marriage. Women who have been infertile for a long time or who have premature aging and irregular menstruation can take "Biotecum" for women.</p>

<p>Regarding the damage to body and mind caused by masturbation, almost everyone knows it. However, its changes in nerves and intelligence are also worthy of attention. Masturbation patients are mediocre and easily irritable, with a great ability to be provoked. They toss and turn in bed and cannot sleep peacefully. They yawn frequently when they wake up in the morning and feel more tired than the night before. Their attention is weak, and they often suffer from headaches and nocturnal emission. Their personality becomes deceitful, self-deprecating, and cowardly. One can see from their haggard appearance that their hearts are not at peace and their physical strength is exhausted. Their appearance is decadent, making people disgusted to see them. Their eyes are lifeless, with dark circles around them. Their hands are ice-cold, and their steps are unsteady and difficult. In other words, a young man who was full of energy, strong, and innocent a few years or months ago has now transformed into a haggard and miserable photograph, suffering from devastation.</p>
<p>To avoid masturbation, the first thing to do is to make young people fully aware of its harm. On the negative side, do not allow them to read obscene and licentious stories and novels, and focus on physical training so that their attention is concentrated on the pleasures of physical and mental activity. As for the medicinal supplements after masturbation, one can use neurasthenia therapy and actively take "Biotecum," a testicular essence preparation for men, which is the most reliable. After taking it, brainpower is enhanced, muscles become stronger, and if nocturnal emission is frequent, one should also take "Naires Nocturnal Emission Pills," which have the effect of stopping nocturnal emission that night.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The True and Correct Method for Treating Leukorrhea <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Of all the venereal diseases, gonorrhea is the most difficult to cure, and therefore the invention of an effective cure for gonorrhea has been the slowest. This is because the viruses involved are very persistent, and it is impossible to completely eliminate them in a short time with over-the-counter medicines that claim to cure the disease in three or five days. To cure gonorrhea, a certain course of treatment must be followed. To say that gonorrhea can be cured in three or five days with internal medicine is like trying to climb a ten-thousand-foot peak in one step. Even a three-foot-tall child would not believe such an exaggerated claim. How easy is it to find an effective internal medicine for gonorrhea? Consider Dr. Peter's invention of the gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinon," which was invented after devoting his life's work and over thirty years of research. It is very different from those superficial people and inexperienced youngsters who lightly talk about special medicines and make reckless statements, resulting in adverse reactions in reality. "Clinon" is made from a special protein-pigment mixture based on the latest scientific theories of modern gonorrhea treatment, rather than specific therapy. Taking it causes each cell to develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect, so it is especially effective for acute and chronic gonorrhea, as well as gonococcal prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, vas deferens inflammation, and gonococcal leukorrhea in women, which are generally ineffective with medicines on the market. Taking "Clinon" can completely and fundamentally solve these problems in two or three weeks for mild cases and four or five weeks for severe cases. Therefore, it has won the trust of medical experts around the world. I ask, can an internal medicine that claims to cure leukorrhea in three or five days have this kind of credibility?</p>
<h3 id="e121">Gonorrhea Lecture: Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road: Polyarticular Gonococcal Arthritis <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Course of This Disease</p>
<p>Polyarticular gonococcal arthritis has various causes, mostly due to excessive activity and mistreatment. Gonococci often flow through the blood to the joints due to the stimulation of activity and attach to the joints, so the affected joints often appear red and swollen. In addition, drinking alcohol and sexual activity can easily lead to this disease. So-called polyarticular arthritis is characterized by inflammation flowing to various joints, but generally speaking, it is mostly in the large joints of various parts, such as both knees, both shoulders, both elbows, and finger joints, where inflammation and swelling occur. However, it also wanders around without a fixed location. When the inflammation in one joint subsides slightly, it starts in another joint. Or it may also be complicated by endocarditis at the same time. If this persists for a long time without healing, the whole body may become paralyzed and disabled.</p>
<p>The Lesson from the Past</p>
<p>In the past, gonorrhea patients often received local treatment and indiscriminately took over-the-counter medicines that claimed to eradicate the disease in three or five days. Local treatment can only kill bacteria locally and cannot eliminate gonococci that are close to guerrilla warfare. As for medicines that can cure the disease in three or five days, they are even less reliable. Countless people have already failed with these two treatments, which can serve as a lesson from the past. Based on my nearly twenty years of clinical experience and observations from various sources, I use German static electricity and X-ray therapy alternately. On the one hand, I use German anti-gonococcal serum to break down the solidified inflamed joints. At the same time, I take the gonorrhea holy medicine "Clinon" internally to eliminate gonococci scattered in the joints, thus quickly curing the disease and restoring the joints to their natural extension. Consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, twenty consultation numbers will be issued every day, with a fee of only five cents per number.</p>

<p>Blood in sputum can certainly startle patients. But it is not absolutely a terminal illness. But it is also not something that can be ignored. In our medical practice, we often encounter cases of bleeding from lung capillaries. Upon examination, the cause is not lung disease. And many people have no blood spots in their sputum, but examination of the sputum reveals that it is full of tuberculosis bacteria. Therefore, in my clinical practice, I advise patients to take absolute care of their health. If it is lung disease, generally speaking, it has probably reached the second or third stage.</p>
<p>I have been treating lung disease for more than three years and feel that the internal medicines that have come out recently have not achieved the effect of radical cure. Among them, the medicine "Bufei Na'er" does have the effect of searching for tuberculosis and nourishing the lungs. This medicine has the effect of directly eliminating tuberculosis bacteria, resolving phlegm, relieving coughs, and coagulating blood. It can also relieve hectic fever and night sweats and promote appetite. All stages of lung disease can be cured radically.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Economic Retaliation by Britain and the United States Against Japan: Bai <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, Japan has been clamoring for the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," implementing economic monopoly in the occupied areas and excluding the interests of third countries. In North China, it implements trade controls, and in Central China, it refuses to allow ships from third countries to navigate the Yangtze River under the pretext of smuggling arms and dangerous navigation. Therefore, Japanese goods currently account for more than half of the value of imported goods in North China. In the Yangtze River basin, Japanese goods have also jumped from third place to first place. The so-called principle of open door and equal opportunity has been fundamentally broken. Recently, Japan has openly claimed that the old principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are no longer applicable to the new situation, and even wants to unilaterally break the treaty. Under this status, Britain and the United States have to decide whether to withdraw from the Far East or not. Since the Opium War, Britain has painstakingly managed its business in China for decades and has established a foundation. In recent years, although trade with China has declined, investment still ranks first. Although the United States has less investment, its trade often ranks first. Therefore, Britain and the United States are unwilling to give up their past efforts and withdraw from the Chinese market. Recently, due to the ineffectiveness of protests, they have considered economic retaliation.</p>
<p>The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>Since the failure of the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy during the Italo-Ethiopian War, there have been quite a few people who doubt the effectiveness of economic sanctions. The Italo-Ethiopian War broke out in early October 1935. In November, the League of Nations convened a meeting and decided to impose economic sanctions on Italy. Of the 58 member states of the League of Nations, except for the two parties involved, Italy and Ethiopia, and Austria, Hungary, Albania, and Paraguay, which refused to impose sanctions, 52 countries participated in the sanctions. The sanctions included: financial isolation, and trade bans on imports of Italian goods and exports of military supplies, mineral products, and metals to Italy. After the implementation of the League of Nations' sanctions, Italy also used the means of boycotting the import of goods from participating countries as retaliation, and implemented controls on finance, trade, and consumption as countermeasures. In addition, Italy is a country with an import surplus, and in recent years, the import surplus has often been more than 200 million lire. Germany and the United States are its largest trading partners. Germany accounts for the largest share of both imports and exports, accounting for 17% of imports and 16% of exports. The United States ranks second. However, these two countries are non-member states and have no obligation to fulfill the League of Nations' resolutions. Japan and Brazil are also the same. Some member states, such as Switzerland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, also claimed that they had close trade relations with Italy and declared reservations about the sanctions. The steps taken by various countries were inconsistent, and the methods were not thorough. For example, coal and gasoline were never prohibited from being exported to Italy. Therefore, the League of Nations' sanctions failed to stop Italy's war of aggression. In June 1936, Britain took the lead in advocating the lifting of sanctions against Italy, and other countries followed suit. The scene of economic sanctions in modern history ended here.</p>
<p>The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Japan</p>
<p>The military situation of Japan is different from that of Italy. The Italo-Ethiopian War lasted only half a year, and then it ended. The effectiveness of economic sanctions was not seen, and Ethiopia was lost. Japan has been using force against China for a year and a half, and two sets of capital have been exhausted (Yosuke Matsuoka said that Japan has three sets of capital: government reserves, social idle funds, and civilian resources), and the end of the war is nowhere in sight. The formation of the Hiranuma cabinet is intended to strengthen fascist rule and requisition civilian resources in order to achieve its goals. However, trapped in the quagmire in China, and encountering external shocks, it will be difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>The international trade situation between Japan and Italy is also completely different. Economic sanctions against Japan were advocated by Britain and the United States, and Japan's trade with Britain and the United States accounts for about half of its total trade. In 1937, Japanese goods shipped to Britain and its territories reached 900 million yen, and goods shipped to the United States also reached 600 million yen, accounting for half of Japan's export trade. In the same year, goods from Britain and its territories shipped to Japan reached 120 million yen, and US goods shipped to Japan also reached 127 million yen, accounting for two-thirds of Japan's import trade. Japan's trade relationship with Britain and the United States is so huge that the serious impact of economic sanctions by Britain and the United States can be imagined.</p>
<p>From the perspective of trade goods between the United States and Japan, silk is the largest commodity shipped from Japan to the United States, accounting for about 300 million yen annually, followed by cotton cloth, accounting for about 50 million yen annually, followed by clothing and porcelain, pottery, etc. Cotton is the most shipped from the United States to Japan, accounting for about 300 million yen annually, followed by coal, gasoline, and metal products, each accounting for about 100 million yen, followed by military equipment and machinery, etc. In terms of trade volume, the United States has a trade surplus and Japan has a trade deficit. The United States has an advantage. In terms of the nature of the goods, the goods shipped from the United States to Japan are mostly necessities, such as coal, gasoline, metal products, and machinery, which are necessary for Japan's national defense and industry. Even cotton, due to the fact that China's production is not enough to meet Japan's needs, is an indispensable raw material. The goods shipped from Japan to the United States are consumer goods. If the United States imposes commercial sanctions on Japan, there will be no adverse effects in the country, while Japan will suffer significant losses. For example, if the sales of raw silk are cut off, Japan's rural economy will be hit.</p>
<p>The trade situation between Britain and Japan is the same as that between the United States and Japan. Seafood and food are the largest commodities shipped from Japan to mainland Britain, reaching 30 million yen annually, followed by raw silk and cotton cloth. Machinery and boats are the largest commodities shipped from mainland Britain to Japan, accounting for about 20 million yen annually, followed by metal products. British goods are necessities, Japanese goods are consumer goods, and Japan also has a trade surplus, so Japan has the greatest advantage in British-Japanese trade. As for the trade situation between Japan and British territories, it is almost a exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials. For example, Japan imports 300 million yen worth of cotton from India annually, while it exports 200 million yen worth of cotton textiles to India annually. Australia ships about 100 million yen worth of wool to Japan annually, and 20 million yen worth of wheat, while Japan ships 50 million yen worth of cotton textiles to Australia. If British colonies cut off trade with Japan, Japan will lack markets for its finished products and sources for its raw materials, and its industry will be suffocated.</p>
<p>Recent Trade Statistics Between Japan, Britain, and the United States (Unit: Million Yen)</p>
<p>Why Haven't Britain and the United States Launched Economic Sanctions?</p>
<p>Japan is poor in resources and relies on foreign trade. The economic pressure from Britain and the United States would be a fatal blow to Japan. Why haven't Britain and the United States taken active action? The political reasons are beyond the scope of my discussion. The commercial reasons are the obstruction of some businessmen. For example, cotton and metal traders in India, wool and wheat merchants in Australia, and cotton, machinery, coal, and gasoline traders in the United States are all opposed to sanctions against Japan due to their own interests. The British and American governments are also worried about mutual retaliation and causing serious disputes. US Senator Pittman said that economic sanctions could bring aggressors to justice, while Senator Borah said that economic sanctions could lead to war. Whether economic sanctions are sufficient to cause war is theoretically uncertain and depends on the actual situation. The key question is whether Japan can resist Britain and the United States economically and militarily. I believe that if Britain and the United States form a united front and are determined to curb Japanese aggression, the Japanese militarists may not take the risk of acting rashly. However, the fear of war on the part of Britain and the United States is sufficient to fuel the arrogance of the aggressor countries and allow them to use their intimidation tactics. Last September, the League of Nations asked its member states to provide individual economic assistance to China and impose sanctions on Japan. The Japanese government spokesman threatened that if the powers changed their neutrality, Japan would consider its attitude towards foreign concessions in China. The interests of Britain and the United States in China are mostly in Shanghai. According to statistics from C. F. Remer, British investment in China is US$119 million, with Shanghai accounting for three-quarters. US investment in China is US$190 million, with Shanghai accounting for 64%. In addition, British and American investment in Japan, according to "The Problem of International Investment" published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1937, reached US$440 million by the end of 1933, mostly government bonds, which is more than double the investment in China. British investment in Japan in 1930 was estimated at £63 million, which is only a quarter of the US$119 million invested in China. However, according to an estimate by Robert Kindersley published in the December 1937 issue of the Economic Journal, British investment in Japan at the end of 1936 was £53 million (mostly government bonds), and investment in China was £41 million. That is, British investment in Japan is greater than its investment in China, which is contrary to the results of Remer's estimate. The exact situation remains to be verified. In short, whether the investment is in Japan or China, it is under the control of the Japanese. Perhaps Britain and the United States are hesitant to implement strict economic sanctions against Japan because they fear damaging their own interests?</p>
<p>Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages of British and American Retaliation</p>
<p>The difficulties that Britain encounters in retaliating against Japan in commerce are temporary. From the perspective of the entire British Empire's economy, it can be said to be beneficial. For example, the British textile industry has always felt the pain of Japanese competition. After the sanctions against Japan, although the import of cotton from India and wool from Australia to Japan will be reduced, the British cotton and wool spinning industries will certainly flourish, and cotton and wool raw materials can be absorbed by mainland Britain. The same is true for US cotton. Before World War I, Japan imported only 1 million bales of foreign cotton annually, while Britain imported 4 million bales. Later, due to the prosperity of the Japanese textile industry and the decline of Britain, and in 1935, Japan's imports of foreign cotton increased to 3.6 million bales, while Britain's imports decreased to 2 million bales. The world's cotton trade volume has always been around 12 million bales (each bale weighs 500 pounds gross and 478 pounds net) without major fluctuations. Therefore, the sales of US cotton can still return to Britain. Other US goods such as coal, gasoline, and machinery do not rely on Japan as a customer. As for worrying about Japan's so-called retaliation, the movements of Britain and the United States regarding loans to China show that this is unlikely to happen.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Process of England and Japan Arbitrarily Handling Shanghai Customs: A Dispatch from the Front <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>(I) The Cause of Negotiations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Japanese shipments entering and leaving the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts, relying on their military force, have uniformly refused customs inspections. Simultaneously, Japanese goods have taken advantage of their tax-free status, massively dumping products in Shanghai. After our army retreated westward, unscrupulous merchants colluded with Japanese merchants, and the influx of smuggled goods surged even more. According to Japanese reports, in the first four months of the 27th year [1938], Japanese liaison ships came to Shanghai 13 times, and other ships 15 times, transporting a total of over 54,000 tons of goods. The main goods were rayon, sugar, piece goods, soybeans, soybean oil, cigarette paper, and seafood, which greatly impacted customs revenue.</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai customs revenue ranked first in the country, reaching 20 million yuan per month during prosperous times. At that time, it plummeted to approximately 4 million yuan per month. Bondholders of various foreign debts secured by customs revenue naturally became uneasy. Foreign capitalist classes, who prioritize profit over righteousness, had no concept of justice. The Japanese used the restoration of customs rights as bait, enticing the British to hold negotiations, coercing Shanghai customs to accept the new tax rates set by the puppet organization.</p>
<p>Negotiations began in February of the 27th year [1938], with the British ambassador to Japan engaging in discussions with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Initially, they proceeded secretively, deeply concerned about being discovered by the outside world. By the time negotiations concluded in May, they announced that the new tax rates would be officially implemented from June 1st. Thus, this illegal and privately conducted farce was completed.</p>
<p>(II) The Content of the Agreement</p>
<p>On May 3rd, Britain and Japan simultaneously announced a public statement regarding the Shanghai Customs talks. The text was very brief, only stipulating that after Shanghai customs revenue was used to repay foreign debt principal and interest, the remaining funds would be deposited in Yokohama Specie Bank. Nothing else was mentioned. What actually manifested after the agreement was established was that the Nanjing puppet organization appointed a puppet official as the Shanghai Customs Superintendent. Although anti-smuggling work resumed in the eastern district of Shanghai customs, the customs officers assigned were limited to Japanese or Western personnel. Of particular note was the implementation of the new tax rules, which eliminated customs surcharges but retained the disaster relief surcharge of 5%. Tax reductions on imported goods included cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cotton, cotton textiles, wool textiles, rayon, seafood, sugar, gasoline, cement, and miscellaneous goods, further benefiting Japanese imports. Furthermore, raw cotton and mineral products, which are raw materials for manufacturing munitions, were completely tax-exempt.</p>
<p>The original text of the Anglo-Japanese public statement on the Shanghai Customs talks is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Since February of this year (1938), the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs have been conducting informal negotiations regarding the repayment of foreign debts secured by Chinese tariffs and other related matters. As a result of the exchange of views, the Japanese government has notified the British government of its proposed temporary measures to adjust this matter during wartime. In its reply, the British government stated to Japan that Britain did not oppose the implementation of these temporary wartime measures, and heard that the United States and France also did not intend to raise any objections. If economic conditions change drastically, these measures may be reconsidered. All taxes collected by customs at ports within Japanese-occupied areas will be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. From these deposits, the amount to be repaid for foreign debts will be allocated to the Inspector General of Customs to fully fulfill the obligations of foreign debts and reparations secured by tariffs. The repayment of these foreign debts and reparations must be regarded as the first item of expenditure after deducting customs administrative expenses and certain customs payments and subsidies from tariffs. The amount of foreign debt payable by each port will be determined monthly based on the percentage of the total customs revenue of all ports in the previous month accounted for by that port. The Boxer Indemnity due to Japan, deposited in HSBC since last September, will be paid to the Japanese government. In addition, measures will be taken to fulfill future payments of the Boxer Indemnity and the portion due to Japan in the 1913 Reorganization Loan, and to repay the overdraft of Shanghai Customs under the Shanghai foreign debt payment item accumulated by the Inspector General of Customs in HSBC this January. The surplus of tariffs in HSBC under various ports under Japanese occupation will be transferred to Yokohama Specie Bank for future offsetting of foreign debts."</p>
<p>(III) Reactions from Various Parties</p>
<p>A. Chinese Customs Staff Stage a Strike: Upon hearing that the puppet organization had appointed a puppet official as Customs Superintendent, all Chinese staff at Shanghai Customs were indignant. On the morning of May 7th, they went on strike and held a general meeting, resolving the following items: Requesting Inspector General of Customs, Luo Fude [presumably a transliteration of Robert L. Smyth] and Chinese Deputy Inspector General of Customs, Qiu Qiwei to come to the Customs House to explain what happened. Electing representatives to establish the Shanghai Customs Chinese Staff Protection Association, with the aim of protecting the integrity of the Customs. Electing 35 executive committee members to form the Executive Committee. Telegraphing the central government to explain the current situation, the circumstances of the strike, and requesting Minister Kong Xiangxi to clearly indicate how to handle it. Resolutely implementing the strike until a concrete solution is obtained.</p>
<p>After the five resolutions were passed, senior customs officials, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, attended to give instructions, earnestly advising that the Customs was a government agency with significant implications for shipping companies. Customs personnel should not leave their posts without orders from the government. Furthermore, the various rumors circulating were not factual, so they should not take action to avoid causing impact on all parties and providing excuses for others.</p>
<p>During the wave of unrest, there was also an incident of customs officers being kidnapped, who were later released after negotiations. Some were also transferred to other customs locations. The wave of unrest thus subsided.</p>
<p>B. Our Government's Protest: After news of the Customs negotiation agreement spread, our ambassador to Britain first raised two points to the British government in opposition: Britain recognized Japan's control of the tariffs of the eight ports in North China. The agreement did not include provisions for repaying domestic debts. After the agreement's public announcement, our government also submitted a diplomatic note to the British Foreign Office, stating that China would absolutely not be bound by the measures agreed upon by Britain and Japan, reserving China's complete right and freedom of action in its customs affairs, and denouncing the action of two foreign countries concluding an agreement on Chinese Customs without China's consent.</p>
<p>(IV) Situation After the Establishment of the Agreement</p>
<p>A. Japanese Imports Soar to First Place: Foreign trade has been greatly affected since the outbreak of the war, but has gradually recovered thereafter. Taking Shanghai as an example, Japanese imports in June of the 27th year [1938] were only worth 200,000 yuan, insignificant. In July, they soared to over 4 million yuan, over 2 million yuan in August, over 4 million yuan in September, and over 5 million yuan in October, soaring to the top spot for imports. Whether all goods entering and leaving Hongkou have been fully taxed remains a question.</p>
<p>Looking at the national conclusion, in January, the United States ranked first in imported goods, at 11,569,100 yuan, and Japan ranked eighth, at 2,418,000 yuan. In February, the United States ranked first, at 18,028,000 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth, at 6,023,000 yuan; In March, Germany ranked first, at 19,018,200 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth, at 10,227,000 yuan; In April, the United States ranked first, at 13,215,000 yuan, and Japan ranked second, at 10,210,000 yuan; In May, Japan ranked first, at 15,361,000 yuan; In June, Japan ranked first, at 18,372,000 yuan; In July, Japan ranked first, at 19,701,000 yuan; In August, Japan ranked first, at 23,825,000 yuan; In September, Japan ranked first, at 24,755,000 yuan; In October, Japan ranked first, at 20,125,000 yuan (all units are in thousands of yuan).</p>
<p>B. Smuggled Goods Still Abound: After the Customs Agreement was concluded, it was hoped that the smuggling of private goods would decrease. However, according to reports, woolen cloth, broadcloth, rayon, bean cakes, matches, canned fish, daily necessities, and other items are still being smuggled in large quantities, without paying customs duties. The selling prices are often one-third lower than market prices, which greatly affects legitimate businesses. According to a report on October 8th, although the Jianghai Customs has resumed anti-smuggling work in the eastern district of Shanghai, it is often hindered by military interference and cannot strictly enforce measures. The trend of smuggling and tax evasion is still rampant. Recently, imported smuggled goods have mainly been daily food items such as rice, white sugar, and salt. It is hoped that all businesses will not import goods of unknown origin. In summary, it can be seen that smuggled goods are still extremely abundant.</p>
<p>C. Customs Forced to Hang Puppet Flag: During the Customs Agreement negotiations, the flag-hanging issue was a major stumbling block. Related parties once indicated that the Customs would not fly any flag thereafter as a passive compromise. However, on November 4th, it was said that under the orders of puppet officials of the puppet organization, the Five-Colored Flag (a flag of a past regime in China) was hoisted high atop the Jianghai Customs building and on various customs vessels patrolling the Huangpu River. Onlookers were disapproving, and public opinion was in uproar, questioning the customs authorities in charge. The puppet flag was subsequently hoisted several times. According to Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Moyler, he had not received reports regarding the hanging of the puppet flag and had reported and requested instructions from the central government.</p>
<p>(V) The Failure of Seeking Skin from a Tiger</p>
<p>Regarding the Customs Agreement, some believe it to be a wartime expedient, expressing regret and stating that China will retain its right of action, with little other commentary. However, there are points worth noting: The original motive after the establishment of the agreement was to prevent smuggling, but smuggling continues as before. This is the first point. Secondly, despite pressure to protect commercial interests in China, the Yangtze River remains closed. The interests of those in China continue to be compromised, leading to further losses. Thirdly, the large remaining customs revenue after allocating for foreign debt and reparations, being deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, is akin to supplying the enemy with food, and is exploited by both Japan and the puppet regime. Foreign reporters have questioned Japanese spokespersons whether the "Reformed Government" has withdrawn or borrowed funds from miscellaneous taxes, using customs duties as collateral, to which the Japanese have avoided answering. Furthermore, the repayment of foreign debt is to maintain our foreign credit, but with the successive fall of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao Customs, their authority is no longer in our hands. Foreign reporters have also inquired with Japanese spokespersons whether the remaining funds deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank will be used to offset foreign debts secured by customs duties. The Japanese only used investigation as an excuse. All this was something the British did not foresee. However, after the incident, they have made considerable concessions to Japanese businesses. Shanghai Customs has allowed the Japanese shipping company to use Japanese bills of lading and fill out Japanese cargo manifests. Allowing a foreign language on the customs bill of lading of a country is not normal, yet English and other foreign languages are used, making it even more unthinkable. Can British politicians, who prioritize immediate reality over long-term planning, hope to maintain their Far East interests by seeking skin from a tiger? If the situation continues to normalize a de facto recognition through tacit cooperation, the loss of their rights in the future will not be limited to this. The Far East hope that Britain has cultivated for centuries has been deprived by its then-ally, Japan. How can it not be lamented?</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 14th: At a meeting held after the signing of the International Wheat Advisory Committee, a report was selected. The main proposal of the report was to convene an international conference to formulate an effective wheat control plan. The meeting also decided to nominate representatives from Canada, Argentina, the United States, Australia, the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary, and Britain, Germany, and France, along with a chairman, to form a preparatory committee for the conference. This committee can cooperate with representatives from the International Institute of Agriculture and seek opinions from representatives of other countries, wheat and flour industry exporters, and economists. The preparatory committee has absolute freedom in preparing the final agenda but must pay special attention to the following points: The necessity of cooperation between exporting and importing countries; Considerations for an international agreement with a famine period as the term; The minimum level of international grain prices; The issue of export subsidies; Allocation of export quotas based on estimated world demand ratios. The preparatory committee will report to the Advisory Committee, which will make the final determination on the specific issues to be resolved by the international conference. The Advisory Committee yesterday discussed a report on the relationship between nutrition policy and world wheat, proposed by the Australian representative, Mr. McDougall. After expressing views on several points, the committee decided to appoint a subcommittee to draft a report on this matter.</p>
<p>Last Year's Bumper Harvest</p>
<p>Without understanding the global wheat harvest situation, it is impossible to understand the contents of the aforementioned conference. With the Second World War looming, increasing wheat production has been listed as an important task in the war preparedness sequence of major powers. According to the agricultural monthly report recently published by the International League of Nations, the area of world wheat fields (excluding Soviet Russia) last year was 111.2 million hectares, more than the 107 million hectares of the previous year, an increase of more than 5 million hectares. In addition, various parties have widely adopted mechanical farming and strived to improve production efficiency. Therefore, last year's average yield per hectare reached a record high of 1.1 metric tons. The total world wheat production last year (excluding Soviet Russia) reached 192 million metric tons, about 90 million metric tons more than the previous year's 104 million metric tons. The most significant increase in production was in countries that have traditionally lacked wheat production, while the increase in countries that originally had surplus production was not surprising, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>(Note) Unit: million hectares; metric tons produced per hectare; million metric tons</p>
<p>In terms of geographical areas, except for reductions in wheat field area in Australia and Africa compared to the previous year, the other areas largely increased, even in the Asian continent amidst the flames of war. Last year, the wheat field area in Asia increased from 20 million hectares in the previous year to 21 million hectares, and production increased from 17.2 million metric tons in the previous year to 18.7 million metric tons. However, the yield rate only increased from 0.826 metric tons per hectare to 0.89 metric tons. In comparison, North America increased from 0.79 metric tons to 0.89 metric tons, and South America increased from 0.85 metric tons to 1.03 metric tons. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The cash market started with a weak disk situation. Yesterday, all transactions were similar to the prior holiday, with no trading at all. However, selling prices were still similar to the prior day.</p>
<p>Gold jewelry prices per tael were unchanged. Da Tonghang Lao Qingyun Shop still maintained the original price of 203 yuan, and Xin Niao Shop suspended it at 201 yuan, taking in at 195 yuan. London reported on the 14th that English pure gold had retreated by a half-penny per ounce due to the strengthening of the pound, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 and a half pence.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice was still limited, with only 7 ships arriving in the river and 4,000 to 5,000 bags transported by vehicles. Sales in this street market were particularly sluggish. However, it seemed that hoarders still had plans, but with the arrival of goods being scarce, sellers were even more determined. The market continued to be in short supply, with the price of thick japonica rice continuing to be several cents to one dime better, and the price of thin indica rice increasing by five or six cents. Zhongguan rice increased by two or three cents. Uniquely, the path for Sheep Horn rice was particularly strong, but there was a lack of supply. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, immediately increasing by one or two dimes. Du Bu Sheep Horn rice only improved by a few cents. The sales of hot-selling goods with a variable profit margin remained healthy, continuing to be quoted at one foot. Yin Yuan rice was reportedly out of stock and had no market.</p>

<h3 id="e134">"Yes" <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"Yes" has always been the spirit of Chinese officialdom. When a superior speaks to a subordinate, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, the subordinate always replies with, "Yes." This spirit was most fully displayed during the late Qing Dynasty. As long as the person sitting above you opened his mouth, you would quickly put the word "Yes" in your mouth. If he ordered you to do something, of course you would say "Yes." If he told you to become a thief, you would also say "Yes." Even if he cursed you as a son of a dog, you would still have to say "Yes." If you didn't, then you didn't understand "etiquette" and were the most worthless person.</p>
<p>It is a pity that we do not have a writer like Guo Moruo. That kind of phenomenon has never been vividly depicted. - In fact, it is not just literary material. Within it, that is to say, within the countless "Yes"s, our past domestic and foreign history are actually buried at the same time.</p>
<p>As long as we have the opportunity to browse through past cases, no matter what the prison is, most of the prisoners' confessions recorded in the trials are repeating the words of the judge, and finally adding two words: "Yes, it is true." But most of that is also "extorted" through torture, but in short, it always wants you to say a "Yes." People who have been cultivated and raised in such a manner will deal with foreign affairs, and their style will naturally be like Chamberlain. The former Zongli Yamen [Foreign Affairs Office] was the place to say "Yes" to foreign dignitaries. As soon as a foreign dignitary entered, making an angry roar, the group of diplomatic officials would say "Yes," "Yes," "Yes." As a result, - needless to say. "Weak countries have no diplomacy," weak countries only have "Yes."</p>
<p>This is only talking about the late Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China was established, "Yes" should have been "revolutionized" away. However, that is not the case. I am not very clear about what is going on in the officialdom. It is said that verbally, there is indeed no such sycophancy anymore. But in terms of diplomacy, starting from the "Twenty-One Demands," a string of events are still saying "Yes" to foreign countries. In terms of domestic affairs, starting from the "March 18th Incident," a string of events still want the people to say a "Yes." The guns of the soldiers cannot be taken down when they see foreign troops, which means our discipline is "Yes." The guns in the hands of the police will be fired when they see petitioning students, which means your discipline is "Yes." In short, the "Yes" said with the mouth has been reduced, or even shouted less, but in reality, the spirit of "Yes" is still being directly and indirectly expressed.</p>
<p>Naturally, there is also a "rebound." The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was unwilling to say "Yes." The Boxers were also unwilling to say "Yes." This is still talking about the late Qing Dynasty. But we can have the Republic of China, in fact, because we were unwilling to say "Yes" to the past. The "May Fourth" and "May Thirtieth" movements were also movements that were unwilling to say "Yes."</p>
<p>Only by resolutely refusing to say "Yes" can we stand tall. However, in the current War of Resistance, which is unwilling to say "Yes," there are actually people who are "Yes" again. That is Mr. Wang Jingwei's licentious statement: "Amity," "Yes." "Anti-communism," "Yes." "Economic cooperation," "Yes." -- "Yes," "Yes," "Yes," we seem to have gone to the former foreign affairs officials of the late Qing Dynasty again.</p>
<p>Is that really the case? I think history should not go backwards.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Night Walker <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Two or three individual shadows turned down the hillside.</p>
<p>The night was quiet. After the war, even the dogs were all dead. The night walkers were not disturbed, jumping over the ice-covered river. The water in the river was covered with a thin layer of ice. Occasionally, a brother stepped on it, making a cracking sound, and the ice shattered into several pieces. "Tsk!" Someone laughed, but was immediately silenced by the captain's stern warning.</p>
<p>"We are on a surprise attack, no talking is allowed!"</p>
<p>The earth was shrouded in darkness. A fierce wind swept through the forest, the bare branches rustling like ghosts. A gust of cold air blew on everyone's noses, freezing them, turning them red.</p>
<p>Cold?</p>
<p>The light of revenge shone brightly in their eyes. With fiery hearts and bodies, the night walkers were warm and happy.</p>
<p>"We're approaching the railway, everyone be careful!"</p>
<p>A section of sentry post was left three miles behind.</p>
<p>"Wu Zixu passed the checkpoint, one checkpoint after another."</p>
<p>Singing the uncouth Peking opera, Yu Zhengde hummed softly.</p>
<p>The night walkers lay down on the ground. A long line of men, what a sight!</p>
<p>Wang Lao San scratched his head and looked around, appearing dissatisfied:</p>
<p>"Surround and attack! I say, attacking the mountain gully won't work! It's a dead end!"</p>
<p>"You're afraid of death!"</p>
<p>Someone mocked him.</p>
<p>"Only dogs are afraid of death! Death! We have to do it right! I'm not clear about the head that cut with a knife. There are soldiers on the railway, damn it, Wangjia Bridge too, front and back, if we fire our guns, we'll be caught in the middle, like catching fish in muddy water, if we go up from north and south, how can we run! You tell me... you tell me, how can we run?"</p>
<p>This star of wisdom should have been employed earlier. The skinny captain shook his head:</p>
<p>"I have my own plan."</p>
<p>He smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>"A plan! Let's see what trick he's going to play!" The night walkers watched intently.</p>
<p>After a while, long-legged Lao Li came running, with long ears sticking up.</p>
<p>"South of Wangjia Bridge, there's a small bank leading to the Yu River. I've already checked it out."</p>
<p>Clever, the captain had an idea. He instructed his brothers:</p>
<p>"Today's night raid is different from usual. Fire a few shots, then run. Follow me. Don't fire too many shots, and don't kill any passing soldiers. This is an order!"</p>
<p>"Haha, if we're going to do it, let's do it right! If you're not going to fight to the death, you might as well sleep well."</p>
<p>"Fire a few shots and run? What? Do you think we have wings, or that we're cowards!"</p>
<p>Insult and belittlement hurt everyone's heart. The night walkers climbed the hillside, silently filled with frustration.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang... bang... bang bang...</p>
<p>A blaze of fire lit up. The faces of the night walkers were covered in firelight. One flower, a beautiful flower... the fire of revenge! Auspicious red flowers!</p>
<p>Counting the fires, a long line of men. Beside the tunnel, on the small hill, in front of the river, at the bottom of the valley... the night walkers controlled the land. Night, blood was boiling, fire was raging, smoke was spreading, people and war were intertwined, life and death were competing.</p>
<p>A mile away, the gunfire from the north and south echoed intermittently. The earth was buried in darkness.</p>
<p>The captain's order was passed to every night walker. The night walkers stopped firing and began to retreat.</p>
<p>After a while, the gunfire started up again, moving more than a mile south of Wangjia Bridge.</p>
<p>Suddenly, like a gust of wind, no trace of disturbance. They reached a conclusion, the night walkers. "The gunfire is retreating north, approaching the great tunnel." The soldiers defending Wangjia Bridge thought.</p>
<p>"The gunfire is retreating north."</p>
<p>Chase! Chase! Chase!</p>
<p>A team of soldiers fired their guns in pursuit. They chased north.</p>
<p>Not a sound, the earth was quiet.</p>
<p>Buried in the darkness: a blaze of fire, a cluster of shadows, the rustling of a string of leather shoes.</p>
<p>One mile south of Wangjia Bridge: leaving a disturbance behind. The stationed army advanced south in response to the gunfire.</p>
<p>The soldiers guarding the road chased and pursued, their guns pointing north.</p>
<p>After a brief pause, another disturbance broke out.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang...</p>
<p>"Advance, advance! The enemy is not far away!"</p>
<p>The stationed army started up their machine guns.</p>
<p>"Fire intensely! Shoot forward!"</p>
<p>The soldiers guarding the road didn't have machine guns, and desperately fired their rifles.</p>
<p>Hiss... hiss... hiss hiss... hiss... broken...</p>
<p>Buried in the darkness: the night's farce! A children's game of slaughter! The carnage of flesh and blood, of friends and family!</p>
<p>Dawn broke. Who were the enemies?</p>
<p>Let's seal this secret! Shame, remorse, sorrow, who will bear this responsibility?</p>
<p>"Thirty-five enemies were killed: twenty-one soldiers guarding the road, and fourteen stationed soldiers."</p>
<p>But the real enemies had gone far away. They bypassed Hunan, took a small bank, and crossed the Yu River. This group of night walkers had completed their task.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Story of a Bird <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— A Private</p>
<p>Contemplation is my favorite thing. When I have free time, I always open the window, face the sky, and let my mind reflect on memories, as light as a dream, as sweet as candy.</p>
<p>I remember when my uncle was alive, he was an expert at raising birds. The hall of our house was filled with birdcages of all colors. Inside were all kinds of birds, red, white, even strange and rare colors, chirping and chirping all day long. My uncle's daily routine was feeding them, letting them out, and cleaning the cages. As a playful child, I found this work quite interesting, so gradually I developed a fondness for birds.</p>
<p>One day, I was feeding parrots in the garden when suddenly a little sparrow was stealing the parrots' food. Caught off guard, the sparrow was caught by me. At that time, I was overjoyed and rushed to show it to my uncle. But he only said one sentence.</p>
<p>"Sparrows can't be raised, it will die tomorrow."</p>
<p>I couldn't understand the mystery of his words: he himself raised many birds, wouldn't they die too, why did he specifically curse the little sparrow that I had caught with great effort!</p>
<p>I secretly put the sparrow in a room, hung it on the kitchen beam, without letting my uncle know.</p>
<p>The next morning, I had high hopes, expecting to hear some chirping. As a result, in a pile of blood, the little animal lay prostrate, lifeless, ending its little life coldly. I cried in surprise, I couldn't bear to look at the terrifying scene. But I still couldn't understand the profound truth: "Sparrows cannot be raised."</p>
<p>When I reached adolescence, I saw millions of people fighting against demons for their own freedom, and I realized the great slogan of "Give me liberty, or give me death." The story of the sparrow in my childhood was a good example of it.</p>
<p>Now, I see the brave soldiers thousands of miles away, fighting for the liberation of the motherland, unleashing the fire of justice against the enemy, I am ashamed, I sympathize, I am ashamed because I understand the meaning of freedom even more.</p>
<p>Who still wants to be a bird in a cage, living a wretched life?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Though the sparrow be small, it has all its entrails." I can say, "Though the sparrow be small, it is full of spirit!"</p>
<h3 id="e137">"Inspiring People's Aspirations" <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Bai</p>
<p>The main purpose of our writing is to express the truths we have realized, to influence the readers. To influence the readers with positive truths, this is "inspiring people's aspirations." Now we should emphasize this meaning even more, so that we can exert the combat effectiveness of the pen and manifest the weapon nature of literature and art.</p>
<p>Based on this understanding, we must use real-life events as writing materials, and expand our vision from the self to look forward to the broad overall situation. Reality is multifaceted and ever-changing, with many writable materials, as long as we broaden our horizons, we will never feel a lack of materials.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of "all the same" and the so-called "eight-legged essay of resistance against Japan" is due to the author's lack of deep understanding of life, floating on the surface, and not reaching the core. The right way is to observe reality more, study reality more, and live seriously. We must not forget that literature and art are nothing more than a reflection of life, and its life is reality.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the goal of "inspiring people's aspirations", we must have a moving power. Empty clamor, even if shouting with all our might, is rarely useful. Only by being realistic, by bringing reality vividly to paper, can we give people a deep and lasting impression. Therefore, we are also against slogan-style works. We are not rigidly narrating, but vividly depicting, and need the artistic processing of literature and art, that is, to be figurative. As a writer said: "A person's character is not only reflected in what he does, but also in how he does it. To express the typical character in a typical environment", then, it can be like the morning bell and the evening drum, awakening people.</p>
<p>We must know that if we do not fight, we will be humiliated, there is no third way. If we do not write works that "inspire people's aspirations", it will inevitably produce a negative and bad effect, making people ignore the bitter reality. This is definitely not what every conscientious writer wants to do. Therefore, I sincerely hope that every writer can actively shoulder the task of combat, and sharpen that pen like a dagger, a bayonet, to clearly distinguish between light and darkness, integrity and shamelessness. The frivolous singing should be stopped. We must shout out the voice of the times, and be a singer of the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e139">The Mingxing Film Studio Occupied by the Japanese Army Was Not Completely Destroyed; Only One Western-Style Building Was Reduced to Ashes <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Mingxing Company's Fenglin Bridge factory, located in the occupied area, has long been occupied by the Japanese army as a military camp. It was previously rumored that they intended to use the film studio to produce "pro-Japanese films," but they have been unable to do so to this day due to their inability to win over the staff. The premises suddenly caught fire last day at 1:15 PM. The flames soared into the sky, and the fire was fierce. It was not until 2:30 PM that it was extinguished. Yesterday's reports all stated that the film studio had been reduced to ashes. An investigation has revealed that the main film studio and two other small Western-style buildings are still standing as before. Only one large Western-style building and a film production room were destroyed. The rest are unharmed. — This can be seen from a distance from the Xu Jia Hui riverbank. It is said that the Mingxing company purchased the factory site in the spring of the 22nd year for 160,000 yuan and moved it from its original location on Du Mei Road. Later, it mortgaged the property to a major bank for 100,000 yuan. The land covers an area of more than 20 mu and originally had three large and small Western-style buildings. The largest one was originally the office of the branch of the staff — the one that was burned down today. The other two are resided in by the GM Zhang Shichuan and the family of the late director Zheng Zhengqiu respectively. The houses and the film studio are not connected, so they were not affected. However, leaving them in the occupied area to be exploited is not something for Mingxing to celebrate.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Mei Lanfang's First Performance of Daiyu Burying Flowers <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>When Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai in the fifth year of the Republic of China, he used his new costume drama "Daiyu Burying Flowers" as a calling card. Every performance was packed, and the word-of-mouth was even better than "Chang'e Flying to the Moon." Shan Yin Kan Daoren, a supporter of Mei, praised Wan Hua's performance of "Burying Flowers" to the fullest, hailing it as an immortal work. On the day of Wan Hua's performance of "Burying Flowers," Dao Ren specially compiled and printed a special edition, called "Mei Lanfang's Daiyu Burying Flowers Libretto," printing 10,000 copies and openly distributing them in the theater. This was the beginning of the trend of song circles printing and sending special editions. The libretto was well-written, using Lian Shi paper, small regular script, and stone printing, the size being similar to the "Drama Monthly" currently published by the Beijing Opera School. The essay "Burial Flower Play Exam" written by the group Kan is recorded and published below: to show the structure of Wan Hua's play and the procedure of the entire play; and to make it a reference for scholars to learn from and to help them to make mistakes.</p>
<p>"Mei Lanfang's play is very well-arranged, the lyrics are all based on "Dream of the Red Chamber," without any fabrication, with Daiyu singing the most. The singing is divided into five sections: 1. Daiyu's appearance introduction; 2. Sweeping flowers sings Xipi slow beat; 3. Burying flowers sings Er Liu beat: 4. The return journey sings Shaking Board; 5. Yan Song Jng Fang Xin sings the opposite Erhuang; all are extremely exquisite in singing and stage appearance. The Miaoci Tong Xiyu fold, which uses pure acting and lines, conveys emotions without leaving any experience, which cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>The whole play has only five people, divided into four scenes: the first scene opens, with a clown-like waiter Shang Mingwen, telling the story of Bao Yu's pampered and preciousness, and the original end of buying books, turning to the next. The second scene is Jia Bao Yu, always played by Jiang Miaoxiang, dressed as a young master, wearing a Zijing crown, wearing a light rosy colored dress with a cape, wearing a gold lock necklace, and wearing Bao Yu, wearing socks and shoes, and he is also a Yihong son. After reading the introduction, he made a lonely and difficult appearance, Mingyan presented the book, Bao Yu read the book Jie, and after reading it, he took the book. The third scene is Daiyu's appearance, Mei Lan sings, dressed in costume, but when he appears, his coat is dark blue, and when he comes out, the audience is in a trance, suspiciously thinking that a fairy has come to fly, hitting Jingduhuo, after reading the first section of Zong Bai, he calls the maid Zujuan, Zujuan is played by Yao Yufu, and she can also imitate it, no wonder those who love Wan Hua also love Yufu. Zujuan takes the hoe up, takes off Daiyu's coat, rolls up the curtain and goes down, Daiyu then does the act of watching the swallows sweeping flowers and burying flowers, this act is very long, from Daiyu to read the introduction and sing Xipi slow beat and Er Liu beat two sections and then down. In the fourth scene, Xiren comes on, enters the garden to look for Bao Yu, Xiren is played by Zhu Ruxiang, who is still flawless, and once played by Chen Tongyun, then the measures are not similar. Xixia Zujuan Shang, holding clothing into the garden to find Daiyi a turn down. The fifth scene is the Miaoci Tong Xiyu, and the Yan Song Jing Fang Xin fold. Bao Yu first comes on to watch the book, falling flowers, and teasing each act, Miaoxiang can also understand. The first half of this scene is purely dialogue and acting, after Xiren asks Bao Yu to leave, Zujuan adds a coat to Daiyu, carries the hoe and goes down, the song during the return journey Jing Fang Xin reverses the tune, it is sad and gentle, and does not lose Qing's identity, Zujuan Shang helps Gui to sing the epilogue again, and feels even more sad, so the audience all stay ear, three days endless, and the inner curtain sings Peony Pavilion Kunqu Opera and reverses the tune, the erhu is unprecedented, so this play is known as a masterpiece Yun.</p>

It is said that she entered the film industry because she resembled Hu Die, but it is also true that she has a special and ardent love for film. She first joined Lianhua Film Company, and the three characters "Diao Banhua" were inscribed for her by playwright Sun Shiyi. It is said that when Sun Shiyi first saw Diao Banhua, Diao Banhua was wearing a coat of sable fur, looking like a spotted sable, so he reversed the three characters "spotted sable" and changed them to Diao Banhua. Her debut work at Lianhua was "Qiu Shan Ming Deng." Later, she joined Xinhua Company for a time, and appeared in "Yichang Night Rain" and "Diao Chan" successively. Now, she has been hired by Yihua Company and will star in the costume film "Daji".</p>
<p>Tong Yue Tong Yuejuan's original surname Early years, she studied with a female actor/male actor (Nujiao Tian) Tong Yuejuan. Tong Xinhua Xinhua, two Zhang Shankun's夭 A long time ago, Tong Juan——Wan Xiuying Wan, named Xiuying, Tong Junqing (stage name play, and only then did he change his name to Junqing. Zhang Yinglin, an employee of today's film company, once appeared in Director Wu Yonggang's "Li Hentian" film. In addition, she is also the director of the "Xinhua Song and Dance Troupe".</p>
<p>Bai Yang — Yang Junli Bai Yang's original surname was Yang, and she was called Yang Junli when she was in Beiping. She only changed her name to Bai Yang after engaging in drama activities, and once cohabited with playwright Ma Yanxiang. When the Mingxing Film Company established the No. 2 factory, Bai Yang joined the Mingxing front line with Hong Shen's recommendation. "Crossroads" established her silver base, but from that time on, her cohabitation relationship with Ma Yanxiang also came to an end. After the war, Bai Yang went west to Sichuan, and now she has become the mainstay female actress of the Central Film Studio in Chongqing. It is said that she and Gao Zhanfei are already in love in Chongqing.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Yanyan's original name was "Qianqian", Bai Hong's original name was "Lizhu", Xu Lai, who used to be famous on the screen, was originally named "Jiehuang", Gao Qianpin's original name was "Xuwei", and Li Zhuozhuo's original name was Xingqiu, which are known by very few people.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Tan Ying Suffers From a Boil on Her Nose; Her Condition Is Gradually Improving After Days of Treatment, But She Is Still Very Worried About It <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Silver Thread</p>
<p>Since Tan Ying left Shanghai with Cheng Bugao, because she missed the soldier and mourned her deceased son — the four-year-old child, who died last year — she was often depressed and silent, and her expression was extremely negative. She drowned her sorrows in alcohol, and under the influence of alcohol, she even burst into tears and often cried to her heart's content. Recently, a very severe boil suddenly appeared on the right side of her nose, causing her constant pain and discomfort. At first, she asked a Dr. Chen to apply medicine for treatment, but it was ineffective. These days, another Dr. Tao has been treating her for days, and her condition has only improved slightly. Recently, she has not been able to film, and if this continues, she will lose her job. But she is still very worried, fearing that if a scar appears on her face in the future, it will hinder her filming career, which is not a small matter!</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun is now Mrs. Wang Yin. She has a small scar on her cheek, which adds to the beauty of the lines on her face. She went from the stage to Tianyi, which was a stage; from Tianyi to Yihua, it was another stage; now it has become another stage. Her marriage with Wang Yin was due to their co-starring in the film "Green Sky." She grew up in the city and has little experience of the world. She is always surprised and makes a fuss about everything. The first time she went to the countryside to shoot on location, she encountered a water buffalo, and she was so frightened that she jumped up and said, "What is this thing? So big!"</p>
<p>Liu Jiqun, the "Oriental Hartai", can be said to be able to perform all kinds of people from all walks of life in movies. He wears sunglasses all year round, a tilted felt hat, and his style is neither fish nor fowl. He appeared on Nanjing Road these days, squeezing through the crowd: the heels of his black leather shoes were crooked, and he smelled strongly of sourness.</p>
<p>Ye Qiuxin has the reputation of being a model beauty, bestowed by the propaganda staff of Tianyi Company. She is a northerner, good at Mandarin and English, and often accompanies foreign friends, going in and out of the Jai Alai arena, and she herself dresses up like a foreign beauty.</p>
<p>The short and burly Zheng Xiaoqiu grew up in the film industry. In the early years, he was probably the male lead in all the films. Because he was short and could not compare with Hu Die in height, he specially made a pair of high-heeled shoes to make up for it. As a result, he had to suffer for three days after shooting a few shots, which can be said to be a sacrifice for art.</p>

<p>And said: "This marshal's seal is such an important thing, Qin Xiang and Yuchi Gong, two grandfathers, have been competing for it, how can you just throw it on the ground? For example, if I were to bestow upon you a treasure, wouldn't you bring it home properly, instead of throwing it halfway? This will punish you for disrespect, kneeling in the courtyard." At the same time, he reprimanded Wei Bubao (nicknamed Wei Jian): How come you don't teach them these rules when you manage the Nanfu? The Neiwu Mansion is fined half a year's salary, and you must be careful in everything in the future." The next day, Wei Bubao went to the backstage to see this Fourth Master, hurried to him and kowtowed, saying, "I thank you for your grace, I have been working for nothing this half a year, please, old man, don't lose your temper in the future, okay?" Ever since Wang Si was punished this time, he had been careful in everything, and dared not be willful in the palace.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, mountains are hard to change, and nature is hard to move. Although he had changed his temper in the palace, when he sang opera outside, he still lost his temper from time to time, and was almost beaten several times. Fortunately, his apprentice-nephew Rui Debao helped him out and reminded him with words, so he was fine. Wang Si was originally a disciple of the Quanfu class, and Rui Debao's master Li Lianzhongchu was a disciple of the Shengchunkuike class. Because these two classes were both taught by Zhang Sanyong, the grandfather of the famous martial artist Zhang Changbao (Xiao Lou Shuyan's teacher), Wang Rui and the two were also considered to be uncles and nephews. In a certain year, Gao Xueqiao's Shangren organized a certain class, and invited Wang Rui and the two to join the performance through the introduction of the old Sheng Meng Xiaoru. At that time, Lao Rui was in his prime, and he always sang the big axis opera when he took the class outside. Wang Si was willing to play the role of a martial arts veteran with him in order to support this apprentice-nephew. On this day, the two of them came to the backstage, and the stage was performing "Luoma Lake". The one who went to Huang Tianba was the young boss Gao Mou. Of course, young people were too hot when singing opera. Wang Si lifted the battle curtain and glanced at it, then hummed his nose and turned his mouth, and said sarcastically: "Is this singing "Luoma Lake"? As soon as he finished saying this sentence, before he could say the second sentence, he saw that the old and young of the Gao family were all glaring at him, staring at him with their eyes. Rui Debao saw that the expression was not right, and hurriedly gave him a low ear (insiders call whispering a bite on the ear) and said, "Fourth Uncle, there are people who beat people in this backstage, please say less jerky words." After hearing this, he closed his bad mouth and didn't say any more.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Relief for Street Refugees <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>On the evening of January 8th, on Guangdong Road (from Sichuan Road to the Shipping Club), I saw many refugees sleeping on the stone steps by the roadside, a total of twelve people.</p>
<p>These twelve refugees were scattered across five sections of the stone steps:</p>
<p>In one spot, there was a sick person, wearing only two thin layers of clothing and covered with a straw mat. The cold wind was constantly howling. This sick refugee was crying in pain from the cold.</p>
<p>In another spot, there was an old woman, an old man, and a young man, sitting silently on a straw mat. After asking, I learned that the young man was the old woman's neighbor, and the old man was her uncle. The old woman's husband had died of dysentery on the same stone steps where the sick man was lying, two weeks prior.</p>
<p>In another spot, there was a couple and a dockworker. They only had one straw mat and one thin blanket on the stone steps where they were sleeping.</p>
<p>In another spot, there was a middle-aged man. He had neither tattered clothes nor a straw mat on the stone steps where he was sleeping, so he could only sit there alone, head hunched and arms crossed. It is said that he spends every night like this.</p>
<p>In another spot, there were four children around fourteen or fifteen years old, sleeping on a straw mat and covered with a cotton wadding.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew harder and harder, and the twelve street refugees were all shivering from the cold. The next morning, I personally took them to the Cilian Association's shelter with the director. The sick person was also taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>The number of refugees sleeping on the streets is not limited to these few; there are at least thousands of street refugees in the entire city! How will these thousands of people survive this cold winter? It is indeed a serious problem. Once the ground is covered with ice and snow, there is a risk of them all freezing to death. According to news from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, in November, an average of one hundred and ten bodies were collected and buried by the roadside every day. Anyone who sees this number must be shocked!</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a prosperous place. It is said that Shanghai people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every night on dance halls, gambling halls, theaters, and tea houses and bars. If they could save just one percent of this expense each day, they could save the lives of thousands of street refugees.</p>
<p>Relieving street refugees is the responsibility of all Shanghai people. How to provide relief? I will propose two methods below:</p>
<p>Establish cold shelters: Any street refugee who can support themselves but has no place to live can stay in a cold shelter. The cold shelter is only for lodging and does not provide meals.</p>
<p>Establish reception centers: Any street refugees who cannot support themselves and have no place to live can stay in a reception center. In addition to providing food and lodging, reception centers urgently need to provide public education.</p>
<p>As for funding, as long as Shanghai people are enthusiastic about supporting it, there shouldn't be too much difficulty.</p>
<p>"The heart of compassion is inherent in all people." Fellow countrymen of Shanghai! Please get up quickly! Save the street refugees! Biography of Famous People</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Hero of Dongguan "Yuan Chonghuan" (1) <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Xin</p>
<p>These days, the war in Guangdong is at a difficult and inextricable point. It is said that on the east coast, the Chinese army once entered "Dongguan"—"Dongguan is a strategically important location, a must-have place for strategists." Thus, "Dongguan," under the threat of firepower, has become a front in the national war. Reading the newspaper reminds one of a famous national hero from Dongguan.</p>
<p>It is said that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, there was a Yuan Chonghuan in Dongguan, Guangdong. This gentleman was very intelligent because he diligently studied every day. He passed the imperial examination.</p>
<p>The knowledge he studied at the time was: How to serve the people? How to maintain the integrity of the country's territory? He did this because the Manchus were causing chaos at the time, the Ming Emperor was suffering from it, and the people were even more miserable! Studying is for saving the country and the people and serving humanity, not for getting promoted and making a fortune. He understood this principle from that time.</p>
<p>One day, he was sitting in his study, studying current affairs, feeling deeply about the rampant Manchus. It was the weather of the third month of spring. A pear tree and a few sparse wisteria vines cast a very quiet reflection on the window. He couldn't help but sigh, "How can others be allowed to snore beside my bed?" After saying this, he picked up his sword and began to dance.</p>
<p>From then on, he studied military strategy, and many wise, loyal, and brave heroes in history became his only good teachers and friends.</p>
<p>Not long after, the Manchus and the Ming Dynasty officially went to war. The Ming soldiers were defeated in battle, and Emperor Huaizong was very frightened. He summoned his ministers to discuss a solution. Someone suggested that a good general should be carefully selected to guard Shanhaiguan. The majority agreed with this idea.</p>
<p>This suggestion suited Yuan Chonghuan's taste. Thus, what he had learned was now an opportunity to put into practice. In order to understand the situation at Shanhaiguan, he secretly rode a horse alone. At night, the bright moon hung in the sky.</p>
<p>He went to Shanhaiguan alone to scout. Later, he reported to Emperor Huaizong, explaining the situation at Shanhaiguan and the strategy for defending it in detail. Unexpectedly, once he started talking, Emperor Huaizong was very amazed and greatly admired Chonghuan's talent. Emperor Huaizong said, "You are truly a loyal and brave good subject. It would be excellent for you to guard Shanhaiguan."</p>
<p>At that time, more than 100,000 refugees in "Thirteen Mountains" were surrounded by the Manchus and could not escape. Chonghuan requested the court to dispatch 5,000 elite soldiers to garrison "Ningyuan" because "Ningyuan" was close to "Thirteen Mountains," and stationing troops there could strengthen the position of "Thirteen Mountains." In addition, he advocated dispatching another 5,000 brave soldiers to rescue the 100,000 surrounded people. Unfortunately, his suggestion was blocked by a short-sighted minister named Wang Zaixin and was not implemented. As a result, only 6,000 people from "Thirteen Mountains" escaped the tiger's mouth, and tens of thousands of lives were lost to the Manchu swords and spears. What a pity!</p>
<p>Chonghuan garrisoned Shanhaiguan, improving military preparations externally and comforting the military and civilians internally. He achieved great results. Later, he was sent to garrison "Ningyuan." Originally, Zu Dashou was stationed there, and the court had told him to build a city for defense, but he had always taken it lightly. He said, "What's the point of building a city? Sooner or later, it will fall into the hands of others!" He was perfunctory every day and refused to take it seriously. When Chonghuan arrived there, he hired civilians and started construction on a large scale. In less than a year, he built a magnificent city. The desolate Ningyuan became an important town outside the pass. On the day the city walls were completed, Chonghuan swore to the sky: "I, Chonghuan, will live and die with this city."</p>
<p>Not long after, Chonghuan led his generals and divided their forces to occupy Jinzhou, Qingshan, Songshan... and other places, opening up thousands of miles of territory. His fame and reputation spread far and wide!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, things followed. Court ministers seized power and envied Chonghuan, falsely claiming that Jinzhou could not be defended and that the garrison should be withdrawn. This news turned Chonghuan's face green with anger. He said angrily, "In military strategy, there is only advance, not retreat. This is the land we won with our blood. If Jinzhou withdraws its troops, Ningyuan cannot be protected. If Ningyuan is not protected, Shanhaiguan is also in danger. Why do you want me to withdraw troops!" Later, he said, "I, Yuan, am the 'Ningqian Dao'. I will be an official there, and I will die there. I swear not to withdraw a single soldier." As a result, the court had no other way but to start from another aspect, throwing away hundreds of thousands of stones of grain, and also withdrawing the guards from Qingshan and Songshan, causing all the residents to feel uneasy and had to escape into the pass with the old and the young.</p>
<p>When the Qing soldiers heard this news, they thought the opportunity had come, so they immediately led a large army across the Liao River to attack Chonghuan.</p>
<p>Chonghuan then summoned his soldiers, gave them instructions, and swore that everyone should work together to defend Ningyuan to the death. He took a knife and cut off his own finger, using his blood to write a bright red character on white cloth—"Loyalty, Bravery, Love for the Country." The soldiers all cried out loud when they saw this. Everyone was willing to fight the Manchus to the death.</p>
<p>The Manchu soldiers besieged the city, and Chonghuan went out of the city to meet them in battle. Because military discipline was strict, everyone was determined to die. After one battle, the Manchu soldiers suffered heavy losses. At that time, Emperor Huaizong originally thought that Ningyuan could not be defended after hearing the ministers' reports, but he was very excited when he received this news. He immediately summoned Chonghuan to Beijing and rewarded him.</p>
<p>Not long after, hundreds of thousands of Manchu soldiers attacked Longjingguan and Da'ankou. Because the troops stationed in these places were incompetent and far inferior to Chonghuan, they avoided the strong and attacked the weak, and attacked there directly. As soon as the war started, the Manchu soldiers occupied many places without wasting a single arrow, and marched mightily to Zunhua. Emperor Huaizong immediately ordered Chonghuan to send troops. Chonghuan immediately sent Zhao Shuaijiao to rescue.</p>
<p>This General Zhao usually admired Chonghuan very much. He was deeply influenced by Chonghuan. Therefore, he deeply understood the great righteousness. He was ordered to set up camp at Santunying near Zunhua, and the Manchu soldiers swarmed to surround Santunying. At this time, he couldn't care about much. Relying on a heart of loyalty, bravery, and love for the country, he killed his way into the Manchu camp, but the Manchu soldiers came up together, more and more. Zhao Shuaijiao was exhausted from killing. He fully expected the local garrison in the rear camp to come out to support him, but the local garrison was afraid that the Manchu soldiers would kill into their own camp and refused to come out. Poor Zhao Shuaijiao's soldiers were all sacrificed, and finally he looked up to the sky and sighed, "My strength is exhausted!" Then he drew his sword and committed suicide. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The main force of the Japanese army in Guangdong, more than 20,000 men, is still concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and no active action has been found, but they have been busy building fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou for days, seemingly to defend Guangzhou. The highway from Huaxian to Taipingchang has been automatically destroyed by the Japanese army, which shows that the Japanese army is afraid of the Chinese army's southward advance. The Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Conghua highway was attacked by the Chinese army, and the thousand or so Japanese soldiers tried their best to counterattack and fought fiercely with the Chinese army, but later collapsed and retreated. The Japanese troops in Zengcheng and Shetouling were attacked by the Chinese army on another night. The Japanese army relied on fortifications to resist until midnight, and the Japanese army in Shetouling was surrounded. Another unit broke into the north gate of Zengcheng and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese army then rushed from Shitan, Guangzhou, to support. The Chinese army retreated to its original position. In short, the Japanese army around Guangzhou is often attacked by the Chinese army from all directions, suffering heavy losses and being in a state of panic. As for Beihai and Weizhou Island, three Japanese warships, including an aircraft carrier, arrived a few days ago to cover the Japanese army's landing and disrupt the people. The residents are suffering greatly. The army seems to have the intention of attacking Jiangmen and Siyi. The Chinese army is on strict guard.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Northern Hunan and Southern Hubei <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The war in northern Hunan is very quiet. Since the Chinese army attacked Taolin and Fengjiacun, the Japanese army has been very busy mobilizing in the Taolin area and has densely laid barbed wire around the garrison. Local people have been brutally killed many times, and many have fled. A team of Japanese soldiers ambushed at Xinkaitang Xijiang Shanping a few days ago and suffered considerable losses. Now all the Japanese warships in Xijiang have retreated to Bailuoji, and only an empty city remains in Yueyang. Therefore, the Chinese guerrillas are advancing towards Yueyang. Southern Henan is also very quiet. Guerrillas encountered the Japanese army in the Xianning Chongyang area and were entangled.</p>

<p>In northwestern Henan, there have only been minor contacts. In the Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zaoshi areas, most of the Japanese troops have withdrawn to the Yangjiachang area. The Chinese army is following and attacking, and has advanced to Chengling, not far from Hanchuan City, and is still advancing. In Suixian Luoyangdian, the Japanese army fought fiercely with the army. Near Zhe River, the Japanese army on the west bank of Jiangjiahe is active again, and artillery is firing at the Chinese army's positions across the board. Hundreds of infantrymen are also attacking the Chinese army fiercely. In the northeastern border of Hubei, Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery are divided into groups to attack the guerrilla forces in Yanjiahe north of Macheng. Under the stalemate, the Chinese army retreated to Yewan. The Japanese army on Dashu Mountain also strengthened its position and seemed to be attacking Luan.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Southern Xun and Central Anhui <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese troops between Yongxiu and De'an in northern Anhui have also had contacts in recent days. Baicha was once recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops north of Zhanggongdu have been constantly firing artillery and releasing poison gas. Many Chinese soldiers have been injured and poisoned, but the Chinese guerrillas once attacked the Japanese army on Highway 9 at night. The Japanese army responded in a panic, and the loss of military equipment and lives was also considerable. The Japanese troops in Wanzhi, southern Anhui, once occupied Honghuapu, but were soon repelled by the Chinese guerrillas. More than 300 Japanese troops attacked the Chinese army's side of Guolong Mountain, but were also repelled by the Chinese defenders. Therefore, in recent days, the situation has been quiet. The Japanese army in central and northern Anhui often mobilizes, and the intention is unknown.</p>

<p>The war situation in southern Shanxi is quite tense. The Japanese army, with 30,000 men, is taking a defensive position in the Yongji Jiexian Anyi area, mindful of the previous failure to attack Zhongtiao Mountain. Another part of the force is attacking Hejin in the north, and attacking Jinxi, Xiangning, Jixian, Daning, and Yonghe, attempting to attack and destroy the base of the Jin Sui Army, and then advance north to threaten, and then seize Yumen to realize its purpose of attacking Shaanxi. However, the Chinese army is attacking head-on, and the two sides are deadlocked. The Japanese army that entered Jixian divided into three routes to attack west, one towards Mafentan, one towards Longwang Mountain, and one towards Xiaochuanwo. The Chinese troops on both sides of the He River attacked from both sides, forcing the Japanese army to increase troops to resist stubbornly. The Japanese army on the Zhongli Highway was defeated in a counterattack by the Chinese army, and Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Puxian were successively recovered. There have been no battles in Suiyuan. The Japanese army is rushing to build an airport in Baotou, and the mobilization of troops seems to be quite busy. According to knowledgeable people, it is nothing more than secretly going and openly coming, creating a false impression.</p>

<p>Discussion of Premature Aging and the Art of Reversing Aging</p>
<p>Although using "old" to address someone can also be a sign of respect, it refers to their seniority or experience. If you say they are old in age, even someone with white hair and a beard will feel unhappy. This is because "old" is next to "death." People have a love of life, and heaven has a virtue of love, so who wants to die? That's why Xu Fu wanted to sail the sea in search, just to avoid death. But from old to death, this is the natural course of lifespan. However, many people are still young in age, but look decrepit. What is the reason for this? According to medical experience, the aging of the human body is greatly related to the gonads. If a person's gonadal fluid is abundant, the metabolism will inevitably be vigorous. The skin, muscles, bones, blood, and endocrine glands will have a large number of new cells. Therefore, even if they are in their fifties or sixties, their skin will not show wrinkles, their muscles will be rich and have a ruddy complexion, and they will still look very young. At the same time, their reproductive power will inevitably be strong. Even if they have a young wife, their love will be stronger, and their family will be harmonious, or they may even have children in old age. How happy and fortunate this is! Such a person will inevitably enjoy a long life, with grandchildren around their knees, enjoying the joys of family! Suppose, if a man commits self-abuse in his early years, followed by nocturnal emission, or is excessively indulgent after marriage, has multiple wives and indulges in lust, resulting in the depletion of gonadal fluid, and the metabolism also declines, then they will be sallow and thin, and wrinkles will appear before they are old. Their mental power will decline, often suffering from nervous headaches, unable to think, with weak memory, short sleep time, or even insomnia. Their kidneys will be deficient and incompetent, with back pain, and their body will be hunched over. Although they are still in middle age or prime of life, they already look like an old man about to die. This kind of pitiful living dead person not only suffers physically and mentally, but also has no hope for their academic and career prospects. Even in the marital sexual life that is indispensable in life, they often cannot get what they want and are hated by their wives! This often leads to family tragedies, or even lifelong regrets for not having children! In short, the tragic fate of those who age prematurely will be even worse than that of short-lived early deaths! But is there an art to reversing aging? Yes, there is. This has shone a different light in the 20th-century medical world. Initially, there were studies by Steinach, Voronoff, and Holmes, among others. Steinach's research was the most insightful and successful. After more than 30 years of hard experimentation, he learned that the gonadal fluid in the human body is greatly related to health and lifespan. Therefore, he extracted the gonadotropin from strong animals such as apes and gorillas and replenished it to the human body using blood transfusions, which proved to be very effective. However, the implementation of the surgery was extremely difficult and could not be universally offered to the public. Later, with the assistance of many famous doctors, the gonadotropin was refined into a preparation called "Steinach's Gonadotropin." After taking it, it could produce sperm, strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood within 24 hours, exerting great efficacy. Although it cannot be said that it can completely reverse aging and make people live forever, it is indeed the most targeted and effective treatment for premature aging and neurasthenia, such as the above-mentioned symptoms. Later, it was repeatedly tested and secretly adopted by famous European and American doctors such as Camking and Jamst, and it was determined to have definite efficacy. At that time, I happened to be studying in the United States and personally saw and participated in the experiments. After I completed my studies and returned to China, I introduced this drug to the Chinese people and repeatedly conducted clinical experiments to determine whether it was suitable for the physique of the Chinese people. I deeply felt that the drug was peaceful in nature and its effectiveness was definite and great. Over the years, I have cured no fewer than tens of thousands of patients. However, those who produce sperm must take "Hiimitus's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent nocturnal emission, which will speed up the effect. However, patients who can personally come to our clinic in this city to receive electrotherapy, surgery, and other new methods can be guaranteed a faster recovery.</p>

<p>Love of beauty is human nature. Not only do women like to be beautiful, but we men also want to be handsome. However, women's love of beauty cannot escape cosmetics (except for women who pursue healthy beauty), and men's handsomeness requires a good figure in addition to clothing.</p>
<p>Speaking of a good figure, it is not easy. First, the height must be moderate, second, the skeleton must be well-proportioned and the muscles must be firm, third, the complexion must be rosy and the demeanor must be upright, and fourth, the eyes must be bright and clear. The vigor of the spirit, the liveliness of the demeanor, the agility of thought, and the serenity of the attitude need not be said. Even with the above four items, how many young people in today's society can pass?</p>
<p>We will not blow hot and cold and say how bad today's young people are, nor will we boast and praise how good today's young people are. We only know to silently observe from a factual point of view and feel that there are too few young people who are complete in spirit, energetic, and strong enough to be called standard handsome men. What we see are nothing more than young people suffering from youthful diseases.</p>
<p>What is a youthful disease? Most readers have already understood it without the author saying it. A youthful disease is of course a very bad disease! It is masturbation. From a health perspective, masturbation can truly be called "playing with things and losing one's ambition." Once a young person is infected, the most obvious symptom is nocturnal emission. Semen is the foundation of nourishing the body. If a large amount is allowed to be lost, the person will become sallow and thin, with back pain, a heavy head, and bitter thoughts. What makes the patient most embarrassed is that the development function is hindered, resulting in local shortness, testicular atrophy, and kidney impotence. With such a withered and weak young person, health is not even worth mentioning, let alone a standard of beauty?</p>
<p>Then, can this kind of young person not be saved? No, if the patient is determined, recognizes the goal, and on the one hand, quickly quits masturbation and engages in noble sports, and on the other hand, rubs the local area with cold water every night before going to bed and takes four "Hiimitus's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate, then nocturnal emission can be stopped that night. As for the various neurasthenia caused by masturbation and nocturnal emission, you can also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotropin" at the same time to nourish and strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and benefit the marrow. In a short period of time, you will be able to restore the youth's inherent vigor, lay the foundation for all happiness, and at that time, even if you cannot join the ranks of standard beauty, you will definitely be able to be a "strong man" full of energy.</p>

<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Good breast development can indeed enhance a woman's beautiful posture. The so-called feminine curves are undoubtedly formed by the towering breasts setting off the plump buttocks. Therefore, healthy breast development is almost a prerequisite for modern women. However, in this turbulent era, misfortune often befalls women. The most common phenomenon is physical weakness, such as irregular menstruation, menstrual bloating and pain, unpleasant leucorrhea, neurasthenia, etc. In this kind of woman, the ovarian function has been devastated, and the metabolism has also declined. Therefore, they are sallow and thin, and their breasts have also shrunk. Although they are still young, they have already become old and ugly. At this time, even if they are covered in makeup and use breast pads to pretend to be healthy and beautiful, those with discerning eyes will know at a glance that it will only increase their ugliness! Moreover, if this kind of disease is dragged on without treatment, it will become anemia and consumption, with a risk to life! In order to adapt to this practical need, medical scientists have worked hard to research and invent the ovarian preparation for women, "Gonadotropin." Once taken, it can enhance ovarian function and invigorate metabolism. It can not only cure various women's hidden diseases, but also promote breast development, whiten the skin, make the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty. If you continue to take it, you can even reduce age, prolong life, and maintain youth forever. Isn't it a treasure for women!</p>

<p>— Compiled by Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(I) A Glimpse of Kidney Deficiency Recovery</p>
<p>Patient Shi ××, 31 years old, residing on Rue Massenet, working at ×× Bank. Mr. Shi was handsome in his youth and enjoyed a considerable reputation in Shanghai. With a wide circle of friends and constant social engagements, his health was depleted and his spirit fatigued, suffering severely from kidney deficiency. Although he had taken various Chinese and Western medications, none were effective. Experiencing both physical and mental anguish, he consulted various venereal disease specialists. Last autumn, he was introduced to me by his colleague Shen Tu Jianjun for treatment. (Note: Mr. Shen Tu also suffered from neurasthenia and underdevelopment, which I cured.) I advised him on proper nourishment and administered the latest painless German "Diemen's" electrotherapy, stimulating his central nervous system. Furthermore, recognizing that the root cause of his condition was a deficiency and imbalance of endocrine secretions in the gonads, I instructed him to purchase "Reproduction Element" from the Hua Mei Pharmacy for supplementation. After two months, his kidney deficiency was miraculously cured, and his body returned to robustness. His physical and mental well-being were beyond description.</p>
<p>(II) Internal and External Treatment of Women's Hidden Ailments</p>
<p>Patient Madame Bao, née Zhen, 24 years old, residing on Route Macgregor. Madame Bao was inherently weak. Due to heavy domestic responsibilities and excessive labor, coupled with inadequate postpartum care, she suffered from abdominal pain during menstruation and persistent leukorrhea, causing her deep distress. Constrained by traditional etiquette, she concealed her condition, delaying treatment. Consequently, her body weakened day by day, her breasts atrophied, and her beauty diminished. Last summer, her friend Madame Zhang Ziting suffered from the same ailment and was cured by me. She then accompanied Madame Bao to my clinic for treatment. I advised her on healthy living methods and instructed her to purchase half a dozen bottles of the ovarian preparation "Reproduction Element" from the Wing On Company's pharmacy department. After taking it, her menstrual pain subsided, her leukorrhea stopped, her body became healthy, her spirit invigorated, and her qi and blood replenished, restoring her former beauty.</p>
<p>(Note) "Reproduction Element" is available in male and female versions. Women should specify "female version" when purchasing.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Old Russia Celebrates New Year on Avenue Joffre <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Every year on January 8th according to the Gregorian calendar, the day marking the winter solstice of the collapsed Russian Empire, the White Russian men and women who wander in Shanghai customarily engage in a day and night of revelry. January 14th, however, is their old calendar New Year's Day. On this day, these more than 30,000 people abandoned by their homeland must, as usual, hold a celebration. This year will certainly be no exception. Although they have lost their positions of power and are no longer welcome in their homeland, I imagine they cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude when they recall the glory and extravagant lives of the past Tsarist era.</p>
<p>Today, wanting to learn something about the Old Russian New Year, I made a special trip to Avenue Joffre, where the White Russians are most concentrated, for a brief tour. There, we naturally do not see the fervor of the French National Day, nor the grandeur of Christmas (the foreign winter solstice). However, many White Russian shops and residential doors seem to be adorned with the atmosphere of the New Year. With simple decorations and neat attire, they have quietly passed the end of the year and are preparing to celebrate today's New Year.</p>
<p>On the sidewalks, one often encounters small groups of White Russian young people, both men and women, all dressed in semi-new clothes, chatting and laughing, seemingly going to visit relatives or attend banquets. The White Russian children by the roadside are also playing mischievously. Like the Chinese children, they are happy and fortunate in the New Year. Naturally, they will never understand the sorrow of the adults, because they have never experienced the glorious days of Petrograd. Although they often hear their parents say, "When we were in Petrograd, during the New Year, it was truly..." These boastful words also contain infinite memories, but the children do not understand them. They only know that during the New Year, they should have good food, good clothes, and good fun, without thinking that they are the descendants of exiles, not knowing when they will be able to follow their parents into that forgotten homeland.</p>
<p>Wandering alone on that Avenue Joffre, filled with exotic atmosphere, looking at the modern goods and three-dimensional displays in the large glass windows, and then looking at the simple New Year decorations in front of the White Russian shops, I suddenly passed by the entrance of a Russian restaurant and involuntarily went inside. Ah! The frenzy here is a stark contrast to the desolation of several Russian shops. The inside is crowded with people, women wearing clothes of not very harmonious colors, young lads, but mostly those haggard officers of the Tsarist era with medals. However, now they have lost their heroic posture of the past, leaving only a pair of faces full of decadence and gloom. They are drinking wildly without any scruples, roaring, laughing wildly, and fighting. They all seem to have completely lost their reason, making the air very chaotic. But at the same time, I also discovered a Russian dancing girl weeping at an empty glass.</p>
<p>Why have they become like this? Perhaps it is life and the environment that have caused them to abandon themselves. I express my utmost sympathy for this group of wanderers who have lost their homeland.</p>
<p>The Russian theater at the intersection of Rue de Saigon is also performing operas today, and the Ukraine Society is holding a grand dance party. It is said that the Russian Consulate General will also hold a grand dance party today. In short, today is a day of revelry for the White Russians. They must temporarily forget the sorrow of being wanderers, the pain of life, and the glory of the past and the shame of the present, to indulge in revelry.</p>
<p>Today, Avenue Joffre has a different scenery than usual. This is the utmost madness and revelry in the White Russian shops and restaurants. However, I think it is more of a recollection of their past lives than a celebration of the New Year. Because, what is there to celebrate for a person who has lost their country!</p>
<p>I walked into a teahouse at the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour, drinking tea while recording my impressions. But when I stepped out of the teahouse, an old White Russian man at the corner reached out and asked me for a penny. At that time, I thought, is he also celebrating New Year's Day? (Fang Zhou)</p>

<h3 id="e157">The Marx Brothers <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Room Service"</p>
<p>RKO Production, Nanking Theatre</p>
<p>After the Ritz Brothers' "Three Musketeers," I saw the Marx Brothers' "The Marx Brothers." People's impression of these Hollywood comedians is even less than that of Laurel and Hardy; sure enough, they are only good at "making a fuss."</p>
<p>Speaking of comedies, we will inevitably think of Charlie Chaplin (we will naturally think of him even more when watching comedies). His "The Circus," "City Lights," and "Modern Times" have been released, and we have been separated from him for several years. Therefore, when the news of his filming "The Great Dictator" was revealed, movie fans all over the world were afraid of eagerly anticipating the early meeting of this new film. And he has given up his previous insistence and changed to filming sound films. The so-called sound film, of course, is not just changing "subtitles" to "dialogue." This is in "Modern Times," we have already seen this Jewish artist's use of "dialogue." - The above is considered nonsense.</p>
<p>"The Marx Brothers" is said to be adapted from a stage play that was very popular in New York. The biggest shortcoming of adapting a stage play into a movie is that it cannot leave the scope of the stage, and the movie is performed on the ground; half of this is limited by the talent of the adapter, and it is also affected by the "presuppositions" of the movie. That is, like "The Marx Brothers," the entire play's performance is almost all within the bedroom of a large hotel, and the Marx Brothers are limited by the script and cannot fully display their "specialties." The only characteristics of a comedy that can be made are the piled-up dialogues. These dialogues may be the reason why this stage play was so "extremely popular for a while"; but it is not suitable for movies.</p>
<p>The story of "The Marx Brothers" is about a group of poor artists who are trapped in a large hotel. Not only do they owe rent, but they also have problems with three meals a day, so the hotel director issued an eviction order. Suddenly a rich man is willing to invest 15,000 yuan to stage their new play, but the check has a stop-payment problem. When the new play opens, this group of poor artists are imprisoned in the hotel room, and finally pretend to be dead and design an escape. When the hotel director discovers that the dead person appears on the stage, he faints, and the finale ends with a joint chorus of a lament.</p>
<p>Poor artists are encountering obstacles everywhere, which is "always the case since ancient times, and even more so now." Hollywood film companies adopt such themes to make scripts, such as "Dan Feng Chao Yang" and "Moon Palace Paradise," all of which deeply depict the encounters given to them by this cold society, making people give them infinite sympathy. "The Marx Brothers" did not even achieve this point, and on the contrary, it made people feel disgusted by this group of artists.</p>
<p>Director William A. Seiter also only fulfilled the duties of a director. Only when the playwright Davis pretended to be dead, and the hotel director Wiggler was at a loss because "human life is a major event," the Marx Brothers' prayers, sprinkling flowers, and singing elegies in that scene were quite humorous, and in a room, suddenly falling from a chaotic mess into a quiet atmosphere, the director was still able to grasp the emotions at that time.</p>
<p>The Marx Brothers' acting skills are still those exaggerated actions. Lucille Ball and Ann Miller have no roles to play, they are just decorations for the show.</p>

<p>— Qu Shigong</p>
<p>Mentioning Wang Ying will bring to mind Jin Shan, and mentioning Jin Shan will also bring to mind Wang Ying, as if there is an inseparable relationship between them.</p>
<p>Yes, in the past, the "Forties Drama Society" had long been said to be a husband-and-wife group of Wang Ying and Jin Shan.</p>
<p>"Wang Ying and Jin Shan," "Jin Shan and Wang Ying," this cry resounded throughout Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now, Wang Ying and Jin Shan are going abroad. My friend W君 wrote to me saying that they are going to the South Seas to perform and plan to donate some money to relieve refugees.</p>
<p>Wang Ying, she is from Anhui, but she herself said that she is from the Ming Dynasty. Her childhood name is Gui Zhen; "Wang" is her mother's surname, because she opposed her father, so she canceled her father's surname, expressing resistance and also showing demonstration.</p>
<p>Around 1929, she was introduced by Chen Wanli to the Chinese Literature Department of China Public School. After January 28th, she transferred to Jinan University to study. At that time, she and a classmate surnamed Wu from Jinan University were passionately in love, but for some reason, the two broke up for no reason.</p>
<p>It is said that when Wang Ying was studying at Zhonggong, there were simply an astonishing number of classmates who pursued her. At that time, she and several theater comrades lived together on North Sichuan Road, and they were often so poor that they did not even have money to buy rice. However, the Zhonggong classmates refused to leave there when it was time to eat. Later, they came up with a way to put up large posters all over the wall: "Wang Ying personally cooks, and each meal is two big coins." The business was unexpectedly prosperous, and in this way, even their own "bread problem" was solved at the same time.</p>
<p>In 1934, she jumped out of the "dark film circle" and ran to Tokyo to socialize with Japanese left-wing artists such as Akita Ujaku and emerging dance expert Nozaki Eifu, and surprisingly became popular in Tokyo. Japanese film companies repeatedly asked people to contact her, asking her to star in one or two films. It is said that Wang Ying originally wanted to agree, but later gave up after being warned by students studying in Japan. One day, an uninvited guest came. He was a Chinese student at the Japanese Police Academy. He asked to see Wang Ying, but after meeting, he did not say a word, only gave her a short knife and ran back.</p>
<p>After receiving this "gift," Wang Ying knew that even if she did not star in a film for the Japanese film company, there would be "bad things," so she packed up and returned to China.</p>
<p>"Life is precious, love is even higher,</p>
<p>If it is for the sake of freedom, both can be discarded."</p>
<p>Wang Ying, you once sang this song, I hope you remember it.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 2: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Instructor Jin Eloquently Discusses the View of Equality</p>
<p>In this tourist agency, there are female staff and male staff. In the past, it was stipulated that if the foreign guest was male, he would be entertained by a male staff member, and if the foreign guest was female, she would be entertained by a female staff member. Therefore, the number of male and female staff in the agency was equal. But later, the female staff became busy, and the male staff became idle. Why is this? Because most of those who come to China to travel come with their families, either with their wives or with their young ladies, and they all like to be entertained by female staff. The reason is that women are gentle and careful, which naturally makes people feel comfortable. Later, the agency gradually had more female staff than male staff. These staff members may have nothing to do for several weeks, or they may be so busy in one week that they are exhausted. However, the monthly salary is paid by the agency, regardless of whether there is work or not. In addition to the salary, they are not allowed to accept gifts from foreign guests. However, some female foreign guests often send gifts to them after returning home due to emotional reasons. I am now talking about Miss Jin Danyu. She had just entertained a female foreign guest a few days ago who came to China to travel. That female foreign guest was a wealthy widow from the United States, named Mrs. Sophia. Mrs. Sophia was originally an industrialist in her own country. Now that she has heard that China is booming after the war and has great resilience, she wants to invest. There are indeed too many industries in China that should be developed at this time. For example, many heavy industries are mainly run by the state, and many light industries are entirely run by the private sector. As long as it does not lose sovereignty, foreign investment is also very welcome. Mrs. Sophia also has many Chinese friends, so after staying in Shanghai for a few days, she went to other places again. I am afraid that she will still return to Shanghai soon. Since Mrs. Sophia left, Miss Jin has been able to have a few days of leisure, so she came to accompany the two Miss He to play. When the car drove to the suburbs, all the roads were newly built. However, there are not many houses by the roadside, only sparsely scattered ones, with a few bamboo fences and thatched huts, forming a rural scenery. Only near the city, houses have been built, many of which have been completed recently, and many are under construction. Jin Danyu smiled and said, "There are many strange sayings in Shanghai. Those newly built roads are still called roads. In fact, horse carriages have long disappeared, and they still use this name. Like Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, they are called Da Ma Lu, Er Ma Lu, etc., which is a bit ridiculous. It seems that your Guangdong is not like this." He Shuangyu said, "We call them what Dao, what Dao. In fact, Dao and Lu are not the same?" (14)</p>
