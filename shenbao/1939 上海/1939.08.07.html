<p>社評</p>
<h3>回敎與抗戰</h3>
<p>日前路透電傳：中國回敎救國協會在渝舉行年會，蔣總裁躬臨致詞，對於回敎之愛正義，及保衛眞理的大無畏精神，備加贊揚云云；是不惟回敎人士所樂聞已也。惜乎所傳不詳，顧有足申述者。</p>
<p>回敎之傳入中國，已閱千餘年，皈依者約五千萬人；代有名彥，夙於政治與文化，俱多建樹；即以修正歷法一端而論，功垂千古，然知歸功回敎者蓋鮮，誠以回敎風氣，篤實相尙，不好張揚；故其歷史不謂不久。信徒不謂不衆，而敎外理解之者不多覯，僅知其以豚肉爲禁忌而已。夫回敎固世界偉大宗敎之一，苟其敎義而祇此簡單之禁忌，別無特殊精神爲之維繫，必無以致其偉大，又安得使人傾誠歸嚮歷久而不衰哉！蔣總裁之備加贊揚，自有所本，決非偶然；若中國今日之抗戰精神，於回敎敎義允相貫通。</p>
<p>原「回敎」之名稱，唯在中國有之，此在世界他處，悉以「伊斯蘭」爲名。「伊斯蘭」者，和平敎也；字之原義爲和平，爲致和平之道；而「伊斯蘭」之敎義，則為完全順主命而無忤於人，以致和平。故回敎之「古蘭經」中，稱眞主爲和平之主宰：其主旨在乎勗信徒以發揮其高尙優美之本能，而維持人間之和平。按之回敎經典，眞主啟示至聖穆罕默德，穆罕默德更以傳諸信徒；要在正心修身，　俗救世；其積極者，有行善種種，其消極者，有戒惡種種。信必篤信，行必篤行，不苟且，不假借，以杜漸防微；故對於非敎徒所備之飲食，縱非豚肉，亦不沾脣。嚴其規律，不容稍出入，如不與敎外人通婚姻，每日自朝至夕必禮拜五决，每年必齋戒一月，一生必朝參聖地墨加一次；死後三日內必告窆，殮不以衣衾，葬不以棺木，裏以素帛，覆以無底之槨，屍與土即，以求速朽；凡此者，略見回敎精神，而爲敎徒所必遵，然回敎之特殊精神別有所在焉。</p>
<p>云何回敎之特殊精神？曰：凡在敎徒、萬衆一心，因篤信眞主而忘其小己。回敎徒認宇宙之間，有大力焉，天地賴以創造，萬物賴以化育，大仁大慈，全德全能，無形像，無方所，名曰「安刺」，（阿刺伯語）譯義爲眞主。人之命運，由其前定，人之善惡，由其賞罰，人生在世，悉爲此獨一之眞主服務；故吾之軀體生命，非吾所有，乃眞主所賜　而爲奉行大道者也；吾之資產，亦非吾所有，乃眞主所賜，而爲濟貧利人者也；眞主詔示吾所當爲者，吾必以全力赴之；縱損吾軀體，亡吾生命，喪吾資產，弗惜也。信行務合一，信而無行，信爲具文，必見諸行，乃爲眞信。英國著名史學家嘉萊爾Thomas　Carlyle所著「英雄與英雄崇拜」一書之第二講「回敎」一章中，嘗稱此爲「拒絕自我」，「滅絕自我」主義。</p>
<p>回敎徒既犧牲「自我」，故視人類在眞主宰御之下，感屬平等，而當以公道相待，雖對奴隸，亦不得行使威力，加以非理。因此之故，回敎徒視逞强侵略，爲人類之公敵，爲敎義所不容，而制止强暴爲對主之義務。蓋逞强肆暴，違反「伊斯蘭」之本旨　苟任令猖獗，不加膺懲，則眞主之大道，將爲毀滅，人民之生活，將爲擾亂；信徒之於除暴安良，不得愛惜一己之生命與金錢，務必同赴大義，以成大節。蔣總裁贊揚回敎爲愛正義，具有保衛眞理的大無畏精神，自是理解回敎之至言也。「古蘭經」中有告誡其敎徒者曰：</p>
<p>「勿以舍身大道爲已歿，實乃長生，爾特不之覩耳。」</p>
<p>「犯爾以兵者，禦之，以衛大道；母踰度。允哉，安刺不喜踰度者，遇敵輒殺，逐敵以復爾故居。迫害之毒，勝於被戕；禁庭（卽墨加之天闕）之下，非敵先兵，勿與鬥；彼若鬥爾，則可殺之；逆民之報當爾，彼止則止。安刺固至恕至慈，與敵戰，必至迫害免，道歸眞，始可已；彼旣止，勿仇之，惟施虐者仇如故，……創之如彼創爾！」</p>
<p>「舍財以衛大道，母以爾手自召滅亡。」</p>
<p>「爾其爲大道戰，當知安刺至聰至知，孰對安刺有嘉貢者，安刺報之維豐，厥維安刺，受之大之」。</p>
<p>「爾曷爲不爲安刺之大道，及爲拯救微弱之男婦與兒童而作戰」！</p>
<p>「汝輩卽因戰負傷，敵亦何獨不傷；……主但識別其穆民，（卽信道者）以獎殉道有功者；從征若遇危難，於正道不餒沮，不畏怯，不屈服，主允嘉共能忍」！</p>
<p>「古蘭經」中類此之告誡尙多，不必殫舉，此種精神，求之他敎，渺不可得。誠使人人能信守格遵，身體力行，則世將無復有敢恃强凌弱以逞其野心者；更無復有願蒙辱偸生而爲人奴隸者，和平秩序甯有不能保持焉耶！吾人於是乃知往昔穆罕默德赤手空拳，艱苦奮鬥，不二十年而蔚成世界空前之偉業者，彼與敎徒具此大無畏之精神，實爲之成功之本也。歐戰既終，土耳其一蹶不振，强敵壓境，幾淪於亡；乃凱末爾將軍振臂一呼，全國響應，不特保全殘破之河山，及今而復稱雄於世界，彼固回敎國家也。在今日之中國，白崇禧將軍實爲秉此精神之矯矯者。</p>
<p>世之論者，亦輒以此爲回敎詬病；並謂穆罕默德當日傳敎，「左手執經，右手持劍；」夫此何足病，病在見劍未見經耳。亦有因回敎之禮俗而菲薄回敎者，其識見允淺；然緣此菲薄之一念而誘致回敎徒與非回敎徒間之磨擦，此則必須開導消弭，未可以其淺而忽之也。若彼嘉萊爾者，以史家如炬之目光，洞明回敎之眞相而推崇之，不稍詆毀；又如日人加藤支智，於其所著之世界宗敎史，盛稱回敎爲適合現代之宗敎；此種見解，所裨不僅在回敎而已。</p>
<p>中國擁有回敎信徒可五千萬人，其散布之區域，以西南爲多，以西北爲允密；西南西北，固中國抗戰之根據也。以五千萬衆，秉伊斯蘭敎，此所得貢獻於抗戰者，必將無可喩其偉大，此爲吾人所深信而不疑。抑知强暴者亦知所忌憚者也，爰以名義相號召，以儀式禮俗相欺罔，建敎堂，誘敎徒，務人其彀，使供驅策；此類消息近頃亦頻有所聞。揆之敎義，實所不容，顧亦得於是而反證回敎力量之雄偉，忌憚之者且覬覦之矣。是則殷願彼敎徒能及時發揚其教義，敎外能自此尊重其敎義，融和如水乳，向抗建之大道而摧手邁進，則回敎之所裨於其國族者，復非僅五千萬衆之力量矣。</p>

<h3>妻子為何不像從前的熱情了</h3>
<p>請先審查你自身有無病態後，再來埋怨你的妻子！</p>
<p>為什麼［妻子總是人家的好呢］？如果他的妻子也在想着：［丈夫總是人家的好］！那怎麼辦，讓我們用公正的眼光來批判一下：妻子如果生了孩子，因為做了主婦而又兼任母親的職務，不免有些煩瑣，這時做丈夫者，是應當予以體諒的．此外也有一種喜新厭舊的丈夫，因為每天老是和自己的妻子厮混在一起，妻子雖仍然和從前一樣的姣好與热情，也要感覺得舞趣了．於是開始其尋花問柳，家花那有野花香，然而這種男子終必自食其惡果，曾幾何時，新相知者也感覺無趣了，不足真實而永恒的爱情離棄了他，就是因為縱慾傷身，使他沉淪在病患的苦海中！痴心女于負情郎。女子的爱情總此較男子為專一。女子除非不嫁他，一嫲了他，那沒有不死心塌地的。以生理上的情慾而諭：處女期常是很谈薄的，但嫁後經過丈夫的挑逗，每逐漸的繼長增高超來。這是生理上的自然现象。所以凡一個精力充沛為妻子所滿意的丈夫，婚後的爱情必能與時俱進，達到歡暢融洽，幸福無此之境！恤男子如果於早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚多妻，荒淫縱慾，把生殖腺液消耗太甚，那勢必精枯血竭，百病叢生，最難免者為腎蒌早洩，發育不全，神經衰弱，精力涣散諸症，是以妻子雖有熱情，丈夫亦何堪消受，身心上受其影響，致釀成妻子的不感不娠，歇欺梯里等症者，實亦多不勝計，是者妻子性感的冷淡，妻之過歟，抑丈夫之過歟？據德國名醫Wamallesing汪曼爾聖博士在德意志醫學雜誌上發表幾個病案中有說：［丈夫的早洩症治好了，妻子的歇欺梯里症也就霍然了］。因為夫婦生活的快慰，在身心上有多麼的裨益，否則雙方均苦不堪言！關於上述各症的治法，據汪博士及余多年經驗，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為特效。因此劑係培補生殖腺之專劑。品質名貴，效力確實，世間殆無其匹。於服後一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用半月，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症必可根本痊愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關。制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。</p>
<h3>遺精與神經衰弱症</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>青年入的精液，好奸的深藏在有精關緊閉着的精囊裏，為什麼會有遺洩，據多數醫家的論斷：均以為所以有遺精，必因神經衰弱，致管束精關的性神經减弱其機能，而有鬆弛現象之故。所以稍受夢境的刺激，或見女色使此物勃起時，均不由自主地有精液遺出。我們只要看一個會犯過自凟縱慾者，什九必繼起遺精症。闪為此種勾當最易使神經衰弱。</p>
<p>精液在生理學上言：就是生殖腺液，實是我人生命的源泉。一個男子絕不犯自瀆縱慾而珍惜其生殖腺液者，必然體格健壯，思想靈傲，精力豐足，此種青年無論在學術與事業上均將鵬程萬里，前途殊未可限量，實為社會之瑰寶，民族國家未來之俊秀人材。同時亦為時代女性所追求，一旦與健美女郎結婚，必然愛情活潑，生活甜蜜，育女生男，幸福無此，可是一個不知自爱的青年，既犯有自瀆縱慾或早婚荒淫，使性神經衰弱，遭致了遺精；復使遺精　延失治，使症象惡化，遺精的次數增加，或竟釀成可怕的滑精漏精症，則因為生殖腺液的遺失過多，性，腦，脊髓三大神經，是有相互聯繫關係的，必愈趨愈衰弱。因此，凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽蒌，精力煥散等症象即纏繞不休，那就使你困頓在愁城苦海之中，不特前途無望，夫婦間的人生幸福亦喪盡無遺！</p>
<p>關於遺精辦法，中外醫師均推崇「希米脫氏固精片」，為最對症特效的聖藥。因此藥於服後則能當固精關，鎮靜神經，常夜即能收安眠止遺之神效。如因遺精過久或早婚縱慾等原因而有上述症象者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，滋養神經，能繼續服用半月，更可助長發育，調整新代謝，上述各症必可根本痊愈。四季常服还可收延年益壽返老還童之效！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎癟和不感症——是破壞情愛的惡魔！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>失去明朗的曲線，毫無肉感人的姿態。所以總不為時代男子所喜，共命運已是很悲慘的了，夫婦爱情已是很淡薄的了。然而因為她乳峯萎癟的結果，共生殖腺卵巢機能失健，必連带患有不感症。你想：這種女子，平時丈夫對她已不甚滿意，如果再在男子性慾昂盛的時候，她却淡焉處之，一無热烈的表示，或更厭倦而拒却之，則其給予男子的影象，當然更惡劣的了，因其更惡劣的了，於是爱情日减，惡感日深，終止視若敞屣，而竞不屑一顧，或另行金屋藏嬌者。這不是很習見的事嗎，據醫學上的諭断。一個女子，要避免此種不幸，自以發育乳峯為第一要着。蓋女性的乳峯如果能够高聳而呈彈性狀態，則卵巢機能健全，新陳代謝作用旺盛，臀部亦必丰腴，曲線畢露，在美的方面，已有肉感動人灼姿態，更何況此輩女性性感濃厚，夫婦間情深膠漆，自然幸福無窮了。但乳峯萎癟的女性，亦可不必灰心，需近代醫藥進步，已有一種卵巢內分泌製劑女用［生殖素］，可以挽救，此劑歷經世界各國名醫證明，認為藥性和平，功效偉大，如繼續服用，不但可使萎癟的乳峯，日形高聳，且能調整月經，消滅子宮疾患，促進妊娠機能，增加兩性爱情，強身　顏，功難盡述。</p>

<h3>淋毒膀胱炎之獲愈</h3>
<p>淋病性膀胱炎，是淋毒由後尿道侵入膀胱而起之炎症。患者多由失治誤治，及自家不知攝生而起。蓋現在一般市醫，學識落後，猶認淋病是尿道間局部之疾患，於拚命用局部之手術洗滌尿道，一則因如在急性淋時，尿道粘膜炎腫，甚至往往有潰爛之事。此時而猶不知利害，悍然用洗滌尿道法，以求淋菌之逐出，無異火上添油，蓋使淋菌乘機內攻，轉逃膀胱，是本來可以避免之膀胱炎，今因誤用此種治法而造成之。此外又有因濫服市上成藥，與遷延不治，或飲酒房事等，均能續發此症。患者尿意頻催，小腹脹滿，小便溷濁，若用膀胱反射鏡騐之，則即可見膀胱頭或膀胱壁均有發炎腫之處甚多，若更用顯微鏡檢查其所漓出之淋絮，則尚可見夾有其他病菌，如膿球菌等。</p>
<p>在療法上最直接者之殺菌法，無過於用膀胱洗滌法，但須手術敏練者，始無遺害。一方用德國濾淋平流電療法，內服最新化學法之特效藥，各方兼顧，則膀胱炎一症，何患其有不良之預後，但是在治療期間，切忌妄行動作以免功虧一簣。尤須切記也。　診時：上午九時至六時止　星期日下午休息</p>

<h3>滬杭路形勢轉緊　華軍向嘉興進攻　日軍猝不及防當遭重創　滬郊眞茹龍華亦有戰事</h3>
<p>日來滬杭鐵路沿綫華軍正規精銳部隊、甚爲活躍、自越過滬杭鐵路後、即紛向蘇嘉鐵路綫挺進、數日前、曾向嘉城試攻、使日軍猝不及防、受創殊重、昨據嘉善來人語本報記者、昨午（五日）十二時左右、日軍爲復仇計、曾派重轟炸機一架、飛往嘉善西塘鎭西塘醫院投下炸彈二枚、萬福樓茶肆落一彈、死傷平民的四五十人、聖堂後面落三彈、獅子橋落一彈、北塘橋西堍落一彈、塔灣呂姓石作落一彈、聞死傷甚多、</p>
<p>華軍攻禾　予日重創</p>
<p>滬杭鐵路沿線、近來日軍戒備、突趨緊張、據聞華軍現在杭州嘉興間、正以大量部隊、分頭向日軍進攻、傳華軍於數日前、會向嘉與城試攻、使日軍猝不及防、受創甚重、同時華軍在杭州四郊及市內、亦迭有發現、故日軍極感恐慌、</p>
<p>滬杭路綫　日築戰壕</p>
<p>頃某君由滬嘉路來滬、據稱日軍正在沿綫趕築戰壕、交通要道、均有鐵絲網設置、日軍恐慌之狀、現於眉宇、對旅客檢查史嚴、凡稍有嫌疑、須經過數小時盤問與搜查、方准通過、</p>
<p>鄉農切盼　華軍到來</p>
<p>日來淪陷區域、盛傳華軍將於九一八以前、收復東戰塲各大城市、至嘉杭一帶日軍、確較以前减少、據一般鄕農稱、現正値獎事正忙之時、新穀瞬將登塲、鄕農常爲日軍拉去充搬運夫、在此農事一日緊張一日之時、鄕農至盼華軍到來、解除痛苦、</p>
<p>楊國才氏　陣亡殉國</p>
<p>向駐滬西靑滬公路迤北杜家巷附近之抗日自衛團顧福生部下之楊國才（即楊毛）部隊、最近向東推進、移駐七寳鎮西北的二公里之沈巷及沈家塘一帶、曾於本月一日中午在七寳鎭上召開軍事會議、商討掩襲駐虹橋路日軍策略、不意爲日方間諜探悉、向日軍部吿密、日軍聞報、即於當晚秘密移動駐虹橋飛機塲之守備日軍、携同機關槍小鋼砲等武器、漏夜馳抵沈巷、將楊國才部四面包圍、在二日晨天時黎明之際、開始猛襲、楊部均在陲夢之中、猝不及防、紛紛四散逃避、迨楊國才聞聲趕出、則已陷入重團、祗得一面還擊、一面後退、詎正在鏖戰之時、突被掩伏暗陬之日軍、施擲手溜彈三枚、致楊氏左手炸毀、腿部亦受重創、浴血滿身、陣亡殉國、是役除楊本人壯烈犧牲外、其部下一分隊、共傷亡三十餘人、此外無辜鄕民之被日軍機槍掃射而死者、亦達二十餘人之多、屍體遺棄滿路、記者於三日道經七寳時、正見大批鄕民含怨帶忿、在鎭上購置棺木、以便收殮一般屈死屍體、</p>
<p>眞茹龍華　昨有激戰</p>
<p>滬西傳來消息稱、昨晨（六日）拂曉時、滬郊龍華鎮處傳來緊密槍聲、六時左右、天空發現軋軋飛機聲、旋突聞轟炸聲兩起、據一般人預料、此定爲日軍與華軍在該處發生激戰無疑、又至八時、日水上飛機一架、又在龍華上空盤旋多時、事後並越租界上空而向閘北沿京滬路飛去、傳華正規軍現正在眞茹及龍華兩鐵路間、活動甚力、</p>
<h3>米業企圖抬價　兩租界當局堅決維持限價　決取締操縱維持界內治安</h3>
<p>靑黃不接、食米供求不能平衡、爲每年必有之現象、今上海各棧房存米雖不多、但當局調查公布之數、各米店內棧存貨、暨一般米商暗中移存他處之數、尙不在內、且麵粉存量、足可供十六個月之需、民食絕對無慮、而米商則視現在當口爲投機壟斷之絕好機會、堅不放鬆、寗願停止交易、不肯遷就限價、據聞現僅浦東沿浦各地、存米有十萬石之譜、雖運滬開銷繁瑣、究尙有微利可圖、然米商亦不願採購、一般麵粉商更乘此時機、將麵粉市價隨米價而高抬、長此以往、勢非由當局統制出售不可、</p>
<p>拒做暗盤　米市停頓</p>
<p>近一週來、食米市塲交易紊亂情形、已達沸點、少數米商祗圖牟利、置當局限價及公會勸導於不顧、致塲外暗盤叢生、米號業公會以米店處境困難、乃於五日起、停止買進限盤貨物、數百米號共同簽字遵守、米市已陷於停頓狀態、</p>
<p>米店態度　轉行消極</p>
<p>米號公會勸導同業遵守限價之通告、在塲外發生暗盤時已二度登報、其關注民食苦心孤詣、市民均早感激、但日來米號門市、除老顧客能出二十二元左右獲得高粳外、一生客出二十元之代價、藏能吃三號米、如欲向共要好米、則答以存貨已罄、購買無從、衆口一辭、實難興之爭辯、態度消極、可見一斑、</p>
<p>操縱米市　企圖放價</p>
<p>新新社記者就各方面調近米市塲之各種作風，如（一）將食米分儲各處、避免調查、（二）米販堅不出樣、故意擾亂人心、（三）米店藉口無米可進、决將底貨賣罄、即吿停售、在此運銷合作操縱之下、米價怎得不漲、暗盤何能根絕、事實證明、目的均在企圖寬放限價、在此非常時期、發生此種現象、殊堪痛心、</p>
<p>租界當局　態度沉着</p>
<p>公共租界工部局法租界公董局、此次規定食米限價、原在維持滬上數百萬人民食糧、保護社會安寗、且規定限價時、曾邀各米業團體代表洽商决定、所定限價、對於維持民食、及米商利益、均皆顧到、故今後决照常執行限價、如有逾限交易、市民可立予檢舉、</p>
<p>米號業談　米市癥結</p>
<p>近來米價高漲市塲間有暗盤超過限價情事、米號業公會以一般米號、處境困難、巳竭盡勸導之責、惟其中究竟有無運銷合作操縱、事關全市民食、希望該業中人、各憑天良、爲公衆造福、則幸甚矣、昨據米號業公會重耍職員聲稱、「米市行情漲落、係米行客商隨時核定、米號上市購米、須聽行客開價、故其價格高低、權操行客、如果客商能遵守限價出樣開價、米號斷不致放價購進、致行銷發生困難、目下店家門市、現均遵守限價、而本會亦已一再通吿各米號嚴格遵守、於此可見在米號業方面、確能遵守限價、此則有事實可證、至於市塲暗盤越價、其癥結所在、全由賣方行客主持、至同業各米號因遵守限價、市塲無處購貨、若以暗盤買進、門售照限出售、不獨犧牲血本、且蹈非法、是以相率自動簽名遵守限價、不買暗盤之米、爲消極之對付、同時並可减少自身之痛苦、又傳梅白格路某大米廠棧房一節、該會亦經派員調查、亦有誤會、蓋鬥市有代客碾米者、並無宿貨超出限價之事、總之、米號以門市爲主、限價旣有標準、高價購入、何從出售、在本會正密事調查、果有違越、即當舉發」云云、</p>
<h3>穩定幣制決心　政府終始不渝　奸商牟利故意造謠作祟　證明無稽人心即可安定</h3>
<p>關於中國政府委託英國印新紙幣十萬萬張之說、上海各銀行未有所聞、故無法證實、但中國政府對維持法幣價値、早有決心、決不有所變更、外傳將通貨膨脹之說、絕對不確、因法幣價値、如果不予維持、則決失人民對政府之信仰、所得殊不償所失、要知法幣信用、尙不能維持、如何能使人民信仰抗戰必勝、建國必成、蓋今日抗戰力量、有所恃於法幣信用今政府對於法定外滙、始終維持、對正當需要、仍予儘量供給、中中交農四行發行法幣、每月由發行準備委員會檢查、逐月公吿、以昭大信、最近之檢查報吿、發行雖增、而現金凖備、仍在百分之四十四以上、較多數國家現金準備爲高、以上種種、則事實證明中國並未通貨膨脹、故預料今日（星期一）起、金融市塲即可穩定、證實謠言之無稽、但奸商之作祟故意放謠之目的、在於牟利、殊令人失望也、</p>
<h3>英商海格輪　駛南洋綫　定明晨起椗　以裝貨爲主</h3>
<p>各外商輪船公司爲維持在華航業起見、除增輪行駛上海香港綫、以及香港海防綫外、並新關南洋航綫、今英商海格輪、準八日晨由滬開香港·新加坡·庇能·仰光·等處、以裝載貨物爲主、至於浙東之舟山羣島（即定海、）自淪陷後、有人與日方接洽領通行證、租輪行駛上海定海錢、兼灣沈家門岱山、此外尙有厦門航綫、在日軍控制之下、亦免强通航、</p>
<h3>菲律賓新汽輪　將航上海　以奎松夫人閨名爲船名</h3>

<p>奎松夫人</p>

<p>可以四十天之杭行、完畢全程、並擬在羅斯安琪兒地方小駐、查悌樂蘭瑪船公司、向具有歷史性之造船公司、其餘姊妹汽輪兩艘、將繼「杜納安蘿蘭輪後、由意大利</p>
<p>船塢出境</p>
<p>明年二三月至遲不出五月、均可吿成、一般人咸希望俟該汽輪由紐的遊歷返馬尼刺時、請奎松總統行命名典禮、</p>

<h3>法大使署隨員　卜利歐來滬</h3>

<h3>非必需品禁止進口　入超可望遞減　已進口徵稅之物准予轉口　輸入口岸以中央統轄為限</h3>
<p>財政部公佈禁止進口貨品辦法後、已通令各地海關實施、旨在减少入超、穩定金融、對已進口微稅之物、輸入口岸付稅時爲中央統轄者、准予轉口、關於必需品之輸入、儘量供給法定外匯、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>通令實施　禁止進口</p>
<p>財政部通令各地海關云、茲爲减少入超穩定金融起見特製定非常時期禁止進口貨品辦法、並用表列名稅則號列及貨品、即日公佈施行、此項禁止進口物品、於禁令頒佈後、同時不許報運轉口、所有進口或轉口之郵包、亦適用該辦法之規定、惟遇有特殊情形、得由本部發給購運特許證、准許相常數量進口、至此項禁止進口物品需轉口時、如能提供確證證明應微進口稅、已於禁令施行以前、在輸入口岸付淸、而該輸入口岸在付稅時尙歸中央統轄者、亦可准予轉口、仰即遵照施行、（表格見報載從略）</p>
<p>必需之品　供給外滙</p>
<p>凡在不禁止輸入之例、而為國內所必需貨品、仍准許進口或轉口、並得依照進口物品申請購買外匯規則、向外匯審核委員會申請購買法定外匯、指定中國交通兩銀行辦理之、惟須繳納法定外匯價格、與中交兩行之掛牌價格差額平衡費、關於土貨之出口、應得之外匯、售給中交兩行、並准領取法定外匯價格、與中交兩行之掛脾價格之差額、所以此後土貨之出口、勢必遂漸增加、洋貨之進口、除必需品外、受嚴格之限制、中國整個入超、可望减少、國際貿易轉好、使收支得以平衡、</p>

<h3>澳洲視英國意嚮　或廢對日貿易　澳華貿易已大有進步　遠東戰事多同情於華</h3>
<p>大陸報云、已往數年來遠東貿易之發展、已使澳洲自治領極關切太平洋事務、且對於英政府或將要求自治領廢止對日任何種附屬貿易、處於遠勝於前之地位、而可予同意、四年來日本向澳洲所購之貨物、（以羊毛爲主）已自幾達一千八百萬鎊跌至六百萬鎊左右、由於去歲貿易突增之故、中國輸入之澳洲物產、（多爲小麥麵粉與羊毛）將與日本每年所購、幾相均等、</p>
<p>澳洲對華　輸出突增</p>
<p>記奢昨（五日）向澳洲政府駐華商務專員鮑登叩詢澳洲政府對英日可能的斷絕貿易關係之反響、據答、一年內澳洲對華輸出突增、實已置中日於購買澳洲貨之相同立塲上、據鮑氏所出數字表示、日本雖退至非澳貨之最大顧客、而澳洲對華貿易則幾已升至戰前水準、以海關金單位計、去歲一至六月、澳洲對華輸出、爲三·七〇二·七三四、本年同期之數字、已達一六·三九七·五九一、</p>
<p>澳日貿易　遭受打擊</p>
<p>至一九三六年七月爲止之一載內、日本向澳洲購買價値一七·六六一·二三二鎊之貨物、對澳輸出、値四·九六九·五七一鎊、一九三六年中旬、澳洲聯邦實施執照制度、志在促進澳洲之生產與協助英國之棉等產物、使澳日貿易、突遭打擊、日本立即在澳洲羊毛市塲上施報復、一九三六年間、購買澳洲羊毛最多者、日本佔第二位、所購的値一千四百萬鎊、至一九三七年七月、日本對澳輸入已自一七·六六一·二三二鎊跌至九·七〇五·七三八鎊、去年又跌至五·九〇〇·〇九八鎊、與澳洲向日購貨之五·三四九·〇八六鎊、相差無幾、鮑氏談論中澳貿易增加、謂已大爲繁盛、一年貿易中、羊毛輸入、已自海關金單位八二·七一〇增至六〇五·八〇〇、</p>
<p>澳洲立塲　與英國同</p>
<p>昨據另一重要澳人語記者稱、關於張伯倫若在遠東有眞正行動、澳洲將作何舉動一節、實無疑慮之可能、屆時縱將犧牲吾人對日羊毛貿易、亦將聆得澳洲之眞切意見、澳洲對去年九月間母國集合號召之答覆、已表示關於軸心事件、同情何方、</p>
<p>日裝廢鐵　迭被阻止</p>
<p>此間須憶澳洲政府中之勞工反對黨完全反對日本及其目前之國際政策、若勞工反對黨於澳洲政策有發言力、則澳日貿易關係將立即斷絕、苟非聯邦政府運用强有力之法律武器、加以干涉、則日輪常被阻不得裝載廢鐵、其數之頻、立可充分窺見工人對中日戰事作何感想云云、</p>
<p>日試牧羊　顯遭失敗</p>
<p>據另一澳人聲稱、無論來日如何、日本唯缺少外匯、始將停購澳洲羊毛、日人曾在東三省試牧螺角羊、而未果、因該地氣候潮濕、不得不在羊足套以橡皮套、以免羊足患病、或謂日人將在東三省遍境牧羊、俾與澳洲羊毛競爭市塲者、據渠私見、日人今運更多之羊前往、則彼等將以更多鮮美之羊肉餐供給游擊隊、</p>
<p>華購軍毯　五十萬條</p>
<p>或有一日為澳洲羊毛與羊之最大顧客、每逢冬季、御用羊毛者日衆、本年度中國工業合作社已訂購軍用羊毛毯五十萬條、中國之羊毛不能應本國所求、不久必須牧羊、先由政府諸部之一專營、而後推及西南部多山區之農民、農業專家在中國西部工作者、已歷若干年、邇來彼等得遷入內地各大學之業畜院、與政府集中科學耕植之推動力甚巨、中國農民飼養牲畜、決非蠢愚之流也、</p>

<h3>北江西路各缺口　傳將定期堵塞　該段內並不與虹口貫通　開放海寗路三處說非實</h3>
<p>北江西路南起自來水橋北堍北迄老靶子路東端一埭商店住戶及里衖、自於上月二十九日起、突爲日方以木桿及有刺鐵絲網攔架後、迄未撤除、昨晨在海奪路封鎖缺口處、復稱有</p>
<p>日兵崗哨</p>
<p>文監師路缺口處、則未駐日哨兵、惟該路東端封鎖區域內、日方搭有布篷、爲留居該區域內居民發給有效期祗二個月之通行證、據住居該區域之居民推斷、現在所留之</p>
<p>封鎖缺口</p>
<p>終將於本月十日堵塞、惟以後海寗路一處之缺口、則仍可望開放、惟爾時進出、均將憑通行證行動矣、查現在新被封鎖處、進口雖尙自由、惟亦祇以東起北四川路西邊、西迄北江西路東邊一段、</p>
<p>新封鎖區</p>
<p>近北四川路處、另佈有障碍物、故虹口居民之進出、仍須走四川路橋及崇明路兩處、有傳日方又開放海寗路等三處、俾便住居虹口區居民進出者、實屬誤會、且老靶子路缺口、並不開啟、</p>

<p>交通與運輸</p>
<h3>赴美留學手續（續）</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>抵美以後</p>
<p>從舊金山或西雅圖乘坐火車到美國東部去，坐椅位（Coach）雖然是比較經濟，但夜無臥舖，且乘坐椅位的旅客，其行李如過一百五十磅須另加運費。運費的計算法亦很昂貴，如行李過多，似乎不大値得，同時乘坐遊旅車（Towistclass）者則可以運送三百五十磅，不另收費（買票寄行李時，要說明係“Transpacific”），短途旅行坐椅位很可以，但自西部口岸到芝加哥須兩日三夜，沒有臥舖則不甚舒服。自芝加哥以東都沒有遊旅臥車，普通臥車較椅位價高百分之五十，並須另加臥舖費，不過此段沒有遠路，最多一畫夜，坐椅位也不會覺得太苦。</p>
<p>坐火車時所需的東西，不過更換的衣衫，睡衣，與日常應用物品，無須多帶行李，現在新車多有空氣與溫度的節制，不致太冷或太熱。笨重行李可交鐵路公司直接運到最後目的地，中途停留幾天也無妨，最多不過略加行李存儲費（平常如過二十四小時，每件每天大的一角五分土下）。運送行李，不甚費事，可在輪船碼頭交轉運公司送到火車站，如果火車未定，也可交轉運公司暫存，自己保留憑單，等買好車票以後即可打電話托轉運公司把行李送到車站，到車站時再換取火車行李票，如果手續不甚淸楚，可以問鐵路公司負責人，或托他代辦。到達目的地，我定住所以後，即可把行李票交當地轉運公司（平常多在車站附近）送到住處，轉運運費定價以城市大小爲標準，普通大的美金二角五分至一元。</p>
<p>在火車上吃東西可到餐車，價格各鐵路不同；吃Platelunch比較便宜，普通大的美金三角至五角。定菜方面可憑菜單上所列各菜中任選一二樣，萬不可照輪船上的吃法，不但價格太高，也不是美國人日常吃飯的格式，餐車侍者小費，的佔餐費百分之十。有時餐車飯食太貴，在每餐時有人到車位上賣食物可以購食。價較便宜，三明治，土司，牛乳，咖啡之類，是最普通的食品，有時火車在較大車站停止，可以下車就食，因爲時間關係也祇能用些三明治之類，火車停留較久時當然也可以吃些普通飯食，自己買東西帶到車上雖然也可以，但總不甚體面。無論如何包紙碎屑等千萬不可遺棄滿地，惹人輕視，有些留學生有時怕人看不起而吃較貴的東西，其實美國人不怕講窮，反倒看不起一般胡亂化錢的「大頭」（美人稱之“Sucker。”）上備有吸烟室，在車座上不能任意吸烟，乘車者實不可不注意。</p>
<p>除坐火車以外還可乘坐長途汽車，此項汽車內亦有臥舖空氣節制等設備，不過沒有火車舒服。自舊金山到芝加哥車費祗不過校火車椅位便宜五六元，不甚値得，反之短途旅行普通在三四百英里以內，爲時不過十小時，反有觀賞風景的優點。並且經過的城市多半是走主要街道的，坐火車幾乎看不到城市的情形，長途旅行除非分作幾段，坐長途汽車未免太苦。</p>
<p>無論坐火車或汽車，如果到達地點有友人來接，可先發一電。所謂夜信Night　Letter在發電次晨送遂，每信可打五十字（姓名住址不在內），較爲便宜，此種電可在開車前或車停時在車站上拍出去，如不熟悉，可交火車上侍者代辨，初次出國在到達終點時有人照拂一切，可以免去不少麻煩咧！</p>
<h3>本埠運輸機關　運費增加</h3>
<p>自外匯暴縮，汽油增價以來，本埠各運輸業乃均感虧折可慮。運輸業公會，曾於上月初間召集同業會商應付辦法，經開會討論結果，即日起，均照原定價目，增加三成。但以汽油售價日高，仍無法維持成本，各運輸行乃不得不再自動增價，以保血本。茲經向中國旅行社及本埠規模甚大歷史攸久之華富運輸行探詢其加價情形，特錄之如次：中國旅行社進出口行李原定價目每件六角，二十一件以上，每件五角五分，三十一件以上每件五角，五十一件以上，每件四角五分，七十一件以上每件四角，起碼運費一元。現在除進口行李，爲解除旅客困難不惜機牲血本，仍照原定價目，未經加價外可所有出口行李，則自八月一日起，改訂價目如下：每件七角，起碼二元。廿一件以上，每件六角五分；三十一件以上每件五角五分；五十一件以上，每件五角；七十一件以上一百件以下，每件四角五分。大批行李面議。試觀上列定價則每件所加之運費，尙不及原價二成，自與其他各家不同矣。華富運輸行在七月初間，曾照原價增加二成，嗣因仍不能維持成本，不得已在上月中旬以後復加二成。故平時每小時五元之卡車，現已改爲每小時七元。承運棉紗，以前按件計算，每件三角五分，現則增至每件四角，所增亦不足二成。至其他各家所增運費，聞均在三成上下。</p>
<h3>旅行通問</h3>
<p>（答）周紀根君：一，滇越火車免費行李為三十公斤，每逾重行李一百公斤取費的越幣三十二元（四等的十六元餘），如不滿一百公斤之行李依照比例計算。二，途經越南時，照相機以不携帶爲妥。三，滇越火車，三等每位越幣三十元五角五，四等十元六角五分（每一越幣的合國幣三元四角左右）</p>
<p>（答）秦恩君：一，新置日用品一小包，如不隨身携帶以郵寄爲妥，設所置各物係個人用品且數量不多，則抵越時僅須付稅，當不致受罰。食品可不付稅。二，港幣越幣在當地兌換與在滬兌換，相差無幾，究以在滬預先兌換爲妥。三，所種牛痘雖未透發，在海防上岸時並無問題。</p>
<p>（答）施介庚君：一，鐵路服務證所作身份設明書之用。二，由衡陽至貴陽猶以取道湘桂鐵路至桂林（三等五元二角五分）由桂林循公路至柳州（票便十元九角）再循西南公路至貴陽（票價三十一元六角）爲妥，如取道長沙而赴貴陽，現聞不甚暢通。</p>
<p>（答）王念遠君：一，經越南而入內地，在越境內穿中裝，並無問題，同時越海關對於行李內之新置中裝，可免納稅。二，過境護照請求法領署加簽過境證時，須備當地殷實店鋪所出具之保證信。如無，須繳現金越幣一百元作爲保障。三，隨帶少量藥品，照章應納稅，唯臨時或能通融。四，由滬至防房艙票每位八十二元，海防至昆明三等火車每位的合國幣一百零四元，由昆明乘飛機至重慶爲國幣二百七十元，包括沿途食宿費用，携帶旅費國幣五百元，恐有不敷之虞。五，海防碼頭駐有中國旅行社招待，照呼旅客。</p>
<p>（答）張啟華君：一，由滬至星加坡，如因乘坐意法郵船之票價過昂，可改乘太古公司輪船前往，較爲經濟，該公司之統艙票價係分二段計算，由滬至香港每位國幣二十四元，山港至星加坡每位港幣四十五元（的合國幣一百五十餘元）</p>

<h3>日本經濟之前途（續）</h3>
<p>— 馮美齊女士譯</p>
<p>Japan’s　Economic　Outlook，by　T．A．Bisson，Foreign</p>
<p>Policy　Reports，Vol．XV，No．7　Jun．15，1939</p>
<p>表（二）日本銀行所握政府公債（千日元爲單位）</p>
<p>一九三八年十二月底，政府公債一四，九三四，七三三，〇〇〇日元以外，尙有未償還外債一，二八七，九九四，〇〇〇日元（約債再估價日元二，五〇〇百萬），及政府購米券四二三，〇三二，〇〇〇元。故政府債務已達一八，〇〇〇百萬日元，遠超國民收入之通常估計。如一九三八年日本國民收入爲二〇，〇〇〇百萬日元，其支出項，公債項，賦稅項之數字仍將甚鉅。</p>
<p>决之爲紙幣流通問題。一九三一年來日本銀行發行之紙幣繼續上增，一九三六年後允甚，見表（三）。其數字爲實際流通之日本銀行紙幣額，朝鮮銀行及台灣銀行所握藏以作通貨準備之日本銀行紙幣數萬萬元尙不在內。一九三一年來流通紙幣之增加與其生產之復興同步齊驅，惟一九三八年後紙幣發行之增加已遠過其工業生產。</p>
<p>一九三八年日本之生產增加已漸緩。其增加數僅百分之·九。生產之普通指數之增加已低於前年增加率。生產貨品與消費貨品之分歧已愈見顯著。生產貨品方面尙强能維持以前之增加率，但在消費貨品方面則跌落百分之八。由此可見日本欲提高生產以應付戰事需要，實非易事也。</p>

<p>一九三八年日本農業生產大减，要由於農村勞工之移入軍隊服務。根據官方估計，禾稻收獲之减少較共他方面爲小。絲繭之生產的减少一一百萬Kwan或一二·五％。穀類收獲，减少亦甚。小麥由九·百萬Kwan减至八·九百萬；大麥山六·九减至六·三百萬；無皮大麥由六·一減至五。一百萬。</p>
<p>上列數字足示消費貨品供給量之激减，農業生產供給量之减少亦著，惟不若前者之甚耳。他方面，貨幣工資大增。一九三六，一九三七及一九三八年十一月份之工廠雇工指數爲一〇五·五，一一七·三，一三二·八。同時期內，工廠中實在工資指數爲九一·八，九六·八及一一〇·二。五穀收成雖不佳，然由於物價之高漲，農產之凈收入較前略增。一年中農產收入估計較前一年增加一〇〇百萬日元，由一九三七年之三，六五叫增至一九三八年之三七五四。然同時商品供給日益稀少。束方經濟學報謂：「觀目前之情形，日本不久將感生活必需品之短少……縱不致造成嚴重之局面，然若供不應求之情形繼續發展，而無補救法以平衡之，則商品價格之突飛猛進，將爲意料中事。」</p>
<p>事實上，物價確已較前高漲，一九三六，一九三七，一九三八年之平均零售物價指數爲一五九，一七四，一九一，同年份，平均生活費用指數爲一八五，一九三，及二〇七，一九三八年十二月份兩者註冊指數爲二一二，可見以後尙在增加中，共巾增加最速者當推燃料，電力，衣服及糧食四項，一九三八年七月以來，若干種物價曾被政府規定，同時中央及地方政府亦有委員會以規定若干種商品之法定價格，並派定數千「經濟警務」人員負責勵行之，然以後物價指數，依然上升，足證官方之控制能力，質不足敵通貨膨脹之壓力也。</p>
<p>以上各種要素，影響民間生活程度不一，國內大專利商——尤其軍火及重工業商——所獲贏利頗巨，其中有在二〇％以上者；所派利則在一〇％以上，他方面，若干出口業製造商遭受嚴重之打擊，同時國內消費品之中等製造工業亦被迫而縮小範圍，結果一般被停歇之工人因無製造軍火之技能，大部遂吿失業，一九三八年三月份失業人數之官方數字爲二六六，〇〇〇；實際上非官方之估計尙高出三或四倍，受雇工人——允其重工業——之工資率則甚高，但其收入之增加能吾應付目前高漲之生活費用，尙屬疑問，農民所受影響甚大，一九三八年農業凈收入估計較前一年僅增加一〇〇百萬日元，然此一〇〇百萬之增加遠不能抵償通常物價之高漲，結果「造成農業收入指數與通常物價指數間之巨大空隙」，農業收入指數在一九三六年爲一〇一，一九三七年降至九三，一九三八年估計爲八四。</p>
<p>以上種種足示日本經濟之每一部門，皆日益窘迫，在今日複雜之經濟制度下，吾人不能斷定其將來，然可肯定者，目今日本經濟縱未至嚴重危機，然已見通貨膨脹之徵象，此乃與中國挑戰之結果也，如戰區再行擴大，日本國內經濟之窘迫，勢將變本加厲矣。</p>
<p>國際上之經濟地位</p>
<p>衆認日本國外之經濟問題，較國內經濟尤爲嚴重，日本國內之缺乏天然資源，本爲發展工業之重大阻力。如棉花，羊毛，高等機械，及多種重要礦產等原料皆須仰給國外。目今在戰事期內此等原料之需要額愈大，故國外貿易之入超亦更甚。</p>
<p>自一九三二至一九三六年中日本貿易曾一度繁榮。眾以爲此時國外貿易之擴大，足增加日本之黃金及外滙準備－大戰時曾有此現象。實際上一九三二至一九三六年貿易雖見擴大，準備米見增加。每年入超爲數頗巨－要由於日本在「滿洲國」之實行軍擴計劃及資本投資，結果貿易平衡不見良好。</p>
<p>一九三一年日本國外貿易總計二，三八三百萬日元，爲一九一六年以後之最低水準。自一九三二年起－如表（四）－開拓上升，至一九三七年達最高度，嗣後又開始迥降。今觀一九三二至一九三六年之情形：該數年中日本貿易發展極著。一九三四年竟超出一九二九年之高水準，一九三五至一九三六年之總數又增加一兆日元。他方面，一年中貿易竟成出超。惟總計五年內，入超共爲二三二百萬日元。</p>
<p>表（四）日本之商品貿易（百萬日元）</p>
<p>除貿易逆差以外，日本叉出口巨額資金，如表（五）所示，該數年中日本在國外之資本投資，增加頗巨。此兩項乃日本支出賬下之兩大要目。收入方而主要者有以下三大來源：公衆服務，如運輸，滙款，商業及工業贏利；黃金與白銀出口；及日本早年在國外投資之逍回。最後一項隨年份以增加。一九三五年日人以日元價格收買中國私運出口之白銀，使日本獲得巨額意外利益。一九三六年未有此項收入，但該年而日本在國外之投資竟達六五二·四百萬日元。黃金在一九三三年後停止出口以來，至今尙未恢復，惟對國外投資資產，則極力設法收回－一九三六年减少四八五百萬日元。</p>
<p>表（五）日本收支之凈差額（百萬日元）</p>
<p>一九三二至一九三六年中日本國民資產有額外增加，生產效力亦見增進，然他方面，日本國際經濟地位則日趨衰落，國家貿易旣見巨大逆差，大量資金又日見輸去，該項資金大部投資於「滿洲國」，有不能生利或最近無利可圖者，故結果損失頗巨。</p>
<p>至一九三七年初，日本之外匯及證券準備漸露空竭之象，一九三七年一月八日藏相提出核准制度以按制外匯，兩月後，又開始大量運出黃金，該年上半年度貿易逆差頗巨，繼而七月至八月中日戰事猝起，情形更見嚴重，當局不得已遂加强採制進口貨及設法减少非必需品之輸入，此外，又重行估定日木，高麗，及台灣諸銀行之金準備，並提出一，五四八百萬日元以爲維持通貨及調整國際賬目之用，因此一九三七年及一九三八年中戰事繼續擴展，而日本當局之所以能從容應付軍火之需耍，當歸功於控制外匯之得力及黃金之有效利用也。</p>
<p>過去二年中日本商品貿易亦大有變動，如表（六）所示，日本帝國貿易在一九三七年曾到達空前之高水準，惟進口遠超出口之上，結果造成貿易逆差六三六百萬日元，至一九三八年進口嚴受限制，入超因得减少一，一一九百萬日元，出口業，因缺乏原料之輸入及世界各界之抵制日本，亦减少四二二百萬日元，結果尙有六一百萬日元之出超。</p>
<p>上列數字僅指日本及其領地之對外貿易而言，並未指日本與其領地間之貿易情形，日本與其領地及「滿洲國」間之貿易，最近大有發展，一九三七年日元集團包括「滿洲國」及其領地（高麗，台灣，及南海管理區），至一九三八年又將中國沿海及內地一部份包括在內，故最後一年中，中日間之貿易遂亦歸入日元集團項下，由表（六）之「實在總數」，可見一九三七年至三八年之貿易數字已重行整理，使日本與日元集團間之貿易，及日本與自由匯兌國家之貿易皆有正確之估計，此外尙有一九三六年之數字，以示二年中變化之方向，</p>
<p>表（六）日本貿易之分佈（百萬日元）</p>
<p>（註）（一）日本與其領地之對外貿易</p>
<p>（二）日本與世界各國，高麗及台灣之貿易</p>
<p>觀上表，可見日元集團內之日本貿易之發展，實有以稍抵日本貿易之逆差，日本與自由匯兌國家間之貿易，在最後三年中計逆差三二九，九二六，五七四百萬日元，一九三八年一年中逆差减少三五二百萬日元。該年輸至自由匯兌國家之出口計减少一，〇三八百萬（四〇·五％），進口遂被迫减少一，三九〇百萬（三九·八％），足見損失之浩大。換言之，三五二百萬日元逆差之减少，實使日木與自由匯兌國家之貿易（包括進出口）損失五分之二。</p>
<p>司時在日元集團內，日本貿易情形亦欠佳。該方面，日本自日元集團之進口殊宜超過出口，以補査日本生產之不足及减少外國貨之進口。事實上則適相反。一九三八年日本與日元集團間之貿易計出超七五三百萬日元。其中出要之出口物爲棉織物，該項織物乃由進口貨生棉製成，因此日本外匯反更見緊張。但進口數字年有增加，惟升勢較緩；一九三八年其輸入計一，四八九百萬日元，約佔日本進口總數之三分之一。日元集團國輸入日本之貨品大半爲糧食（米，糖，大豆），决之爲煤，鐵，及少量生棉羊毛。此外，日本需向國外購買機器，油，橡皮，巨量金屬，生棉羊毛之大部，及若干半製成金屬品，自日本對自由匯兌諸國之出口漸衰及國內黃金儲藏漸見短少以來，此項物品之進口亦漸見困難。</p>
<p>一九三七與一九三八年日本國際賬目之得以平衡，端賴硬幣與金銀條之出口。近年日本無形貿易之數字本有公布，其金銀之運出數乃得自輸入國（主要者爲美國）之統計。一九三七年之輸出計八九二百萬日元，一九三八年之輸出計六三四百萬日元。而此項輸出適與日本對自由匯兌國之進口支付的略符合，其進口支付一九三七年有九二六百萬日元，一九三八年有五七四百萬日元。日本進口額既如是鉅大，又必以黃金輸出抵付之，日木之黃金凖備能維持幾多時日耶？</p>
<p>日本黃金儲藏之四分之三皆於一九三七至一九三八年間用以應付國外支出。總計日本近數年間所有黃金共的二·二五〇百萬日元，其中一·五五〇百萬日元乃黃金再佔價後所留存，四〇〇百萬日元於再估價前運存國外，三〇〇百萬則爲戰事發生後十八個月內所生產。其用途則一，四五〇百萬日元運往國外，三〇〇百萬日元爲進出口資金，五〇〇百萬日元爲一九三九年一月一日日本銀行之金準備。其結果日本之凈存數僅五〇〇百萬日元，及本年內生產估計數額二〇〇百萬日元。日本與自由匯兌國之貿易如不能改進，此七〇〇百萬日元之黃金準備仍將用以應付一九三九年之國際支付。觀乎一九三九年初數月之貿易數字，對自由滙兌國之出口仍見衰退，進口則維持一九三八年之水準，可見其貿易差額有退而未有進。</p>
<p>如局勢更形嚴重，日本將乞助於另外數項外匯來源無疑。例如對自由匯兌國之進口尙可减少；戰事需要或出口工業之原料可加以更嚴格之限制；國外投資資產項下更有若干可取用者。日本國內之金銀飾物已被强迫收集，惟不能起過五〇或六〇百萬日元。日本現尙不能壟斷中國之商業，華北通貨與外匯之統制如能實行，日本即可以該區域對外貿易之贏利以彌補其外匯差額。惟能否成功，尙難斷言。自英日訂立協定後，中國海關收入即被移存橫濱正金銀行。一九三八年日本於該方面得外匯七五〇萬日元。惟今後恐將以日元或當地通貨付給日方矣。表（六）示一九三八年日本目中國本部之進口甚小，幾不滿百分之一。生棉煤鐵之進口皆大衰，僅鹽較爲重要。目前戰事進行時期內，中國誠不能如「滿洲國」之爲日本經濟資產。而一九三八年日本對中國本部之出口幾倍於其進口。由於通貨情勢之混亂，日本對中國之貿易常使其資金逃至外國租界，其正確之估計不可得，惟爲數必不小。（未完）</p>
<h3>日本人荒</h3>
<p>日本在華的廣大戰塲上需要龐大的軍隊；在中國的消耗戰術下，更使日軍耗損了近百萬人。戰區尙在繼續擴大，但日本的人力，已有無以爲繼的危機了。在日本國內所有的報章雜誌裹無不滿載着討論日勞働力不足的對策；工廠主不惜以高工資引誘工人，政府不得不以勞働統制來維持軍需工廠的勞力；農村漁林間因勞力激减而都由女工擋大任；結果也免不了生產的激减。更致命的，因爲壯丁大都迫送來華而先後死亡，因此他全國的婦女，大都成爲變相的寡婦。出生率已在大形激减。同時又因國內物價極度缺乏與厲行節的的結果，人民健康大受損害，因而死亡率反在激增，下面便是他內閣統計局的自白。</p>

<h3>統計　邁進中之生活指數　食住上漲無止境</h3>
<p>本市居住問題，日形嚴重。木年第二决調查房租，於七月舉行，木月房租指數爲二八二·四一，較本年一月至六月間指數又增百分之四·六七，以較去年六月至十二月指數，則增百分之九·三七。各種房屋增租不一，東洋式房屋計增百分之六·九一，石庫門增六·六九，平房所增最後，計〇·九〇本月所查各屋之中，增租者計佔百分之二九·三一，其中百分之一七·二四，爲增加水費，百分之六·九〇爲舊租戶遷出，另召新戶，增加租金，百分之五·一七爲酌加租金。戰事發生以還，本市各種房屋，莫不一再增租。法院爲保讓租利益起見，凡增租在百分之二十以上者，或短時間內迭决增租者，輒加駁斥。於是一般二房東，輒以住戶加多，水費激增爲詞，紛加水費，而所增之數，往往遠過實際用水之消耗，此種增加水費，實爲變相之加租。</p>
<p>米價自六月份劇漲之後，本月月初，逐步趨跌，大牛由於天時潮熱，囤戶脫手之故。七月十七日，經兩租界常局與米商會商結果，再度佈吿抑低限價，最高粳米，每石售價不得超過二十元，客秈不得超過十六元。限價甫定，而匯市劇變，貨主居奇，不肯脫手，價遂趨漲。而當局以民食爲重，力持限價，於是市上遂發生以决貨抬售高價情事，高貨幾於絕跡，迨後混亂益甚，市塲有行無市，暗盤交易，多逾限價，然多私相授受，不立成單，以親避限令。迨至月杪，兩租界當局聯合澈查棧米，投機囤戶，亟欲脫售過戶，市價始略見回。</p>
<p>零售物價，大致趨漲，食物類中，肉類與蔬菜，上漲允烈，鹹肉較上月漲百分之五九·七八，鮮肉一一·五二，靑菜四一·八二，蘿蔔二七·二七，韮菜二五·七六·共他鮮魚。鴨蛋，白糖等，漲風亦厲。外匯暴縮，煤球價漲，每担高至二元六角至二元八角不等，全月平均價爲二元〇八分，較上月漲百分之一四·六四。茲錄本月，上月，去年同月，指數於後，以資比較，（二十五年物價爲基數）</p>

<h3>冷氣環境</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>熱天，高貴的人們對於自己的住所，一定要講究得一個適當的溫度，當然，最舒適的低溫屋子，惟有裝設冷氣的一法了。</p>
<p>冷氣是靠機械的力量製造的，物質中「能　的嬗變，科學上的原理並不複雜，以氮（阿摩尼亞的一種）用高壓力使它變做液體，再减少壓力，還原成氣體，於是需要供給多量的熱，這熱量就從屋子的每個空隙裏被吸收出來，因此，在這間屋子裏的溫度逐漸低落了。奔走於九十度以上的空氣中的人們，走進這有冷氣設備的地方，覺得非常凉爽，可是這種冷氣的裝置，很費金錢，所以都市裏也只有幾家大公司，娛樂塲纔有這種不輕易的設備哩。</p>
<p>有些人，自己覺得體弱，所以　怕冷氣，因此望冷氣房間而裹足不前的，比比皆是，這實在是要不得的怖怯，假使你在劇烈的出汗後，一旦達進冷氣環境刺激太厲害，孱弱的人身體抵抗不住，也許容易犯閉汗受寒等疾病。但身體强壯的人毫不受影饗，如果你不曾劇烈出汗，在這冷氣環境中辦事或娛樂，倒也一些勿妨害身心健康。總之，一個人的身體，對於寒與熱的抵抗力，須多受訓練，譬如習慣洗冷水浴的人，他並不會因受寒而致病，倫敦華盛頓很多年高的政治家，他們終日在冷氣環境中幹着工作，也並不完全喪掉他們的老命，可是這裏須聲明一下，眞正高貴的冷氣環境，頗適合穿西服的人，必要時套上一件「上身」就行啦！</p>
<h3>夏天談夏衣</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>天一熱，一切棉衣夾衣見了會使人起一種厭惡心，而各種輕衫凉衣，現在便是最當令的時候了。我國原有的夏季衣料，如紡綢，雲紗，夏布等，莫不精美絕倫，輕快凉爽，要添製夏衣者，大可從中求之，何必再仰給舶來，耗費外匯呢！</p>
<p>紡綢：舫綢潔白細軟，乃夏季衣料中之最佳者，「眞金不怕火」，雖然人造絲的夏衣料大量向市塲傾銷，但紡綢至今仍保有最高的地位，夏季衣料，大有非此莫屬之概！以紡綢裁製夏衣，無論長衣短衣，男袍女袍，中式西式，莫不左宜右有，不暇外求。紡綢產地，杭嘉湖各屬均有，但以杭州的杭紡和盛澤的盛紡爲最負盛名。</p>
<p>雲紗：雲紗也稱拷綢，是廣東的特產，質地極爲堅固，一襲衣服，往往可以穿上六七年而破裂的。售價尙不高昂，洗濯非常便利，所以最爲一般人所歡迎！並且輕爽透風，夏天穿此，最爲凉快舒服，近年來常見婦女們以之裁製旗袍的，穿了不但美觀，而且挽回利權，（可以少穿一件舶來品原料的旗抱。）這倒是很値得提倡的。</p>
<p>夏布：江西萬載的夏布，馳名遐邇，有粗細之別，穿了凉爽輕快，原是我國最普遍的夏季衣着。可惜近年來舶來品夏衣料低價傾銷，而夏布有漸被淘汰之勢！只要一看昔日盛行的夏布長衫，至今竟成鳳毛鱗角，便可明瞭夏布的銷路已如何地衰退了！其實，夏布旣堅固耐洗，穿了更覺落落大方，與舶來品夏衣料相比，有過之無不及，那末我們何必捨此就彼呢！</p>
<h3>値得提倡的國貨筵席</h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>自從巿商會勸吿各業，停止宴會採用魚翅以後，實行的人雖然很少，但成績不是說沒有。可是「不吃魚翅一而改採用其他名貴的山珍海味，如燕窩，烏參，鮑脯等，則於節的的原則旣不確合，而距離减少漏卮之途，更是遼遠；而且因着物價飛漲，筵席價格提高，設不急謀改革之道，中下的薪給階級們因碍於塲面，——社會風尙所趨，一遇必需的喜慶宴會，實在有不勝負擔之苦。因此，筆者認爲提倡國貨筵席，以减低筵席價格，實在是目前急不容緩的了。</p>
<p>下面，筆者就來試開一張國貨筵席的菜單，籍供參考：</p>
<p>（一）四大菜：鷄粥魚肚，淸燉全鴨，金銀蹄子，白汁桂魚。（二）六熱炒：淸炒蝦仁，洋桃銀耳，口蔴燉鷄，紅扒廣肚，雲腿　司，油炸雙尾。（三）二道點：荳沙饅頭，鷄肉餛飩。（四）其他：四雙拚盆，四色水菓，各客瓜子。</p>
<p>上面這張菜單的價格，在較大的酒菜館內，每席的十元至十一元，在較小的菜館和廚房內，的爲八九元或七元左右，比較「有翅菜」或具有其他山珍海味的菜，要降低四元至六元（當然這還是就起碼的翅菜計算的。），這在中下階級市民，是比較容易負擔的多了。</p>
<p>關於這，我們希望社會和各業團體，積極擴大推行起來，提倡起來，以打破塲面制度，减少市民們的痛苦。同時，有閒和有產階級們，也値得來仿效和提倡，因爲從這喜慶和宴會中所省下的錢，是可以多多益等地去捐助給難胞們的。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>夏季，是瓜類最時髦的時節，水果中如西瓜，浜瓜，黃金瓜等，果然出盡鋒　，無論富的貧的，都以一嘗爲快，而蔬菜中，則有冬瓜黃瓜絲瓜撑着門面，也一樣的佔着重要地位。冬瓜黃瓜葷素都用得着。絲瓜則在素菜中獨當一面，從沒有在葷菜中漏臉的。冬瓜煮法最多，火腿冬瓜湯，又鮮又淸，是下飯最好的一樣湯菜，即如白燉蹄膀，平常用蘿蔔的，現在就山冬瓜取而代之。進一步如白燉雞白燉鴨等，也都需要冬瓜的合作。至於素的煮法，如紅燒素冬瓜，冬瓜燒豆腐等，也很可口。黃瓜與時蝦同炒，這是最普通的一樣葷菜，只可惜蝦價太貴，我們不能常吃罷了。其他如粉皮拌黃瓜，醬漬黃瓜，也淸雋有味。絲瓜與無錫麫筋同炒，自是腴美，而紅燒素十景，也少不了它。</p>
<p>星期一　冬瓜火腿湯　紅燒小白魚　黃瓜拌粉皮　靑菜炒線粉</p>
<p>星期二　洋葱牛肉絲　醋溜黃魚片　清炒紅莧菜　燉臭豆腐乾</p>
<p>星期三　韮菜炒肉絲　黃瓜炒時蝦　紅燒素十景　香椿拌豆腐</p>
<p>星期四　乾菜紅燜肉　糖醋前于帶　魚絲瓜炒麫　筋　菜黃豆芽</p>
<p>星期五　咖哩牛肉片　榨菜蛋花湯　京冬菜粉皮　紅燒捲心菜</p>
<p>星期六　冬瓜白燉肉　乾燒鳳尾魚　乾絲茶豆芽　百葉炒　菜</p>
<p>星期日　肉炒醬　　魚湯　燉茄子　炒芹菜</p>

<p>在二十萬年以前，地球上就有人類出現了，可是當時的人類，全身長着許多毛，沒有衣服穿；吃的東西，不過是動物的肉和植物的果實；住在山洞或樹林裏面，簡直和獸類差不多。大槪到了最近的五千年，人類才戰勝了各種獸類，逐漸進步。</p>
<p>人類戰勝獸類，是一件很不容易的事。我們旣沒有鹿一般强健的腿可以奔跑，也沒有虎一般鋒利的爪牙可以抵禦，更沒有堅甲可以遮蔽全身，又沒有毒液可以殺死敵人；然而人類終於是勝利了。這究竟是靠的什麼呢？</p>
<p>人類所以能戰勝獸類的原因，最大的，就在人類有腦可以思想，有手可以做各種歡類所不能做的事情。人類靠了這天賦的力量，利用科學來减輕自己的勞力，改善自己的生活。這樣經過了三千多年的研究和改良，我們的生活才達到現今的景象。要是沒有科學，怎能有這般的境地呢？所以，科學是人類生活的明燈，一部偉大的科學史，便是人類的生活史。現在我且就衣食住行這四方面分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）衣服方面——養了蠶來取絲，這種方法，在我國古代早就通行的了。但是這種幼稚的方法，實在非常麻煩的，先要種植桑樹，已費去了人類不少的心力。再用桑葉養蠶，直到能吐絲作繭，叉須費去許多的精神。人類用這種麻煩的方法來取絲，差不多已有二千多年的歷史。科學家是做改良工作的人，對於這件與人類生活有重大關係的事情，當然不能輕易放過，所以從公元一千八百五十五年起，就有科學家想出簡易的方法來，不必種桑養蠶，用人工把植物的纖維變成像蠶絲一般的東西。大概到了一千八百九十二年的時候，現時所用的人迭絲，便已發明了。蠶絲遇汗變黃，人造絲却不然；蠶絲對於光錢的反射力，也沒有人造强；而且人造絲的辰度和粗細，可依人意製成，這是蠶絲所絕對做不到的。所以全世界人造絲的產額和銷數，都超過蠶絲。</p>
<p>（二）食物——人類的飲食習慣，已有幾千年的歷史。過去素食的人不願葷食，而葷食的人又不慣素食。科學家對於這件事情，曾費了不少的努力，想把這兩種習慣溝通起來。素食和葷食的分別，不過是所吃的脂肪來源不同，倘使能設法把植物性油變成動物性油，這樣的「人造脂」，無論素食的或是葷食的，就都可以吃了。經過了許多科學家的研究，這理想畢竟是實現了，所以從一千九百年起，人造脂就漸漸在市塲上銷行了。</p>
<p>（三）居住——因爲耍想得到舒服和快樂的原故，人類的居室和器用，就漸漸地發明了。地球上的人類旣逐年的增多，要想使居住的地方不發生恐慌，必須變占據地面爲占據空間。靠着鋼骨水泥製法的發明，重樓疊室，便不難建設了。美國紐的地方，七十多層的高樓，誰能不說是非常偉大。科學家對於器用的創造費的心力允多；利用熱水汀來禦寒，利用冷水汀來却暑，利用電流通過金屬絲發光，製成電燈，到了晚上天黑的時候，燈光照耀，差不多和太陽一樣。</p>
<p>（四）行走——自然賦給人類的力量很薄弱，旣不能負很重的東西，又不能走很遠的路；沒有生鰭，就不能在水中游泳；沒有生翼，更不能在空中飛翔。有優越腦力和手力的人，因此常想把這難關打破，經過無數人的硏究，和長時間的改良，利用水力和風力來替人類工作，漸漸成了事實。到了十一世紀的時候，科學家又我到比水力風力要大的蒸氣和電氣，想把很重的東西，運輸到很速的地方，早成爲很容易解決的問題了。就是在水中游泳，或空中飛翔，也已變成了事實。布舒納爾（Bushnell）製成可以在水內行駛的潛水艇，萊脫（Wright）兄弟又有飛機的發明，水內空中可以自由活動。</p>
<p>上面是幾個最顯著的科學對於改進人類生活的事實。耙之有了科學以後，人類就漸漸脫去了野蠻的生活，各種節省勞力，節省時間的發明，漸漸使人類走到文化的路上，得到更加安樂，愉快的生活。所以利用科學，才能創造我們的新生活。</p>

<h3>惶悚與感謝</h3>
<p>— 于伶</p>
<p>從上海劇藝社的友人傳來消息，「夜上海」公演有期了。照常理，算是該劇本作者的我自已，會感着興奮愉快的。但是，這次，代替與奮愉快的，是惶悚與感謝。</p>
<p>過去，由於自己愛好戲劇，學習編寫劇本，只是初生之犢，不怕老虎地膽大妄爲。只是現實逼人，骨鯁在喉地一吐爲快。未求寫劇技巧，未計成功失敗。在創作劇本缺少的所謂劇本荒中，偶而上演，僅作爲「充數之竽」而巳。在「女子公寓」和「花濺淚」的演出中，雖然承高明的劇評家的不棄，給以指導；雖然蒙熱情的觀劇者的見愛，寄予鼓勵，但是在我自己是每一度回想與反省，多一决不安與不滿。幾有從此不敢膽大妄爲，埋頭窗下，硏鑽十年，再與愛我期我者相見的私自決定。</p>
<p>是兩個半月之前，生下十八個月，活潑健康的孩子，不幸由於養護之疏忽，竟致一病兩月，終於死了，不曾留下一角照片，連不曾留下一個名字地死了，窗外月白，傳來斷續的聲聲：</p>
<p>月兒彎彎照九洲，</p>
<p>幾家歡樂幾家愁！</p>
<p>幾家夫妻同羅帳？</p>
<p>幾家漂零在外頭？</p>
<p>唱得那麼凄涼欲絕，使我坐立不安，奪門而出。我見F原是想安慰我什麽的，可是塲面却變成了「相對無言」，浴在月光下出神。沉默中，反而引起了伊的鄕思。於是，由「舉頭望明月，低頭思故鄕」的情景，終於吟出：</p>
<p>幾年不到合江園，</p>
<p>說着當年也斷魂！</p>
<p>只有梅花知此恨，</p>
<p>月下相逢却無言。</p>
<p>在這皎潔的月下，伊又是低佪感傷，如泣如訴勾起了我的舊恨新仇。由這基點，孕育出了「夜上海」中梅氏家庭的遭遇。</p>
<p>忽忽執筆，叉衝動地忘記了過去的失敗，趕成亂得像一團草的五幕。</p>
<p>承上海劇藝社友人們的不棄，排爲璇宮劇院開幕，劇藝社長期公演的第一個戲。在我是多麼惶悚無地的事呵！惶悚的是劇社冒了一次犬險，我又膽大妄爲了一决。</p>
<p>感謝李健吾，顧仲彝，吳仭之，陳西木諸先生，給了我許多寳貴的意見。更感謝沉着應戰的朱端鈞先生，不但肯擔任導演如此忽促中帶着小勝計數之缺點的劇本，而且在每一幕寫完之後，就用心地看，給我不少卓見深慮的指示。限於審查通過，限於演出時間，在導演過程中，朱先生又苦心地圖削去若干塲合，去蕪補粹，使「夜上海」完盡了許多。我是素來這樣主張的，在高明的導演下，劇作者只是提供一些演劇的材料，一個劇本，比之一片做佈景板的三角板，是貴重不了許多的。這决在「夜上海」的演出中，我只貢獻了一方木板，有些可看的地方的話，全是朱先生的導演和各位演員的演技。</p>
<p>「夜上海」浴在璇宮的新嶔新脚允中，公演了，我於惶悚之餘，衷心地感謝着！</p>
<h3>靈魂到底有無？</h3>
<p>— 竺</p>
<p>對於靈魂有無問題，好多人至今尙未解决；有的人說：人生在世，落得吃吃喝喝，尋尋快樂，死了拉倒，何必去研究靈魂的問題呢。又有人說：看得見的是眞的，看不見的是假的，靈魂在那裏並沒有看見。又有人說：人死如燈滅，歸於烏有了。有什麽靈魂不靈魂。亦有人說：人有三魂六魄，死後一魂在家堂，一魂在墳墓，一魂去投胎。更有人說：三魂六魄乃三魂落魄，人死了魂散魄落了。這是一般人對於靈魂之見解。各位，請你自己想一想，靈魂到底有無？不可人云亦云，因爲這是很要緊的！是關乎你我、永久之生命的，教們總要思想，經過深切的考慮，理是則是，理非則非，也不可有存見。我們現在照眞理來解釋，靈魂到底有無？靈與魂是有分別的！限制我們單講到魂的方面，我也可以說就是生命。礦物稱爲定質，是沒生命的。植物說有一種生命，可以呌牠生長現，所以植物能開花結果，傳種接代，生生不息。動物比植物更高一等，除了生長魂之外，尙有知覺魂，所以動物能知痛癢，冷熱，肌渴，亦略知親疏愛惡關係等。人比動物允高一等，除了有生長魂，和知覺魂以外，更有寳貴的靈魂。所以人非但能生長，能知覺，更能思根過去和米來各樣之事！茲將人有靈魂各樣之理証述之於後；（待續）　上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>介紹新穎技巧的嘗試</h3>
<p>— 吳仭之</p>
<p>抗戰勝利之後，中國的話劇必有一番改觀。但是初期的結果，決非純型。因爲體系未立，勢必糅雜。於是比較守舊些的也許爲了看到中間的渣滓而非議全盤的形式。比較維新些的則叉爲了部分的成功也許一味地新穎是圖。或者竟會由此而引起論爭，可是長足的進步，也許以此爲起點。</p>
<p>內地話劇的演出，當然以宣傳收效爲第一，所以常常儘量地遷就觀衆。演出方式的翻新，其實也是迎合觀衆心理的一端。在內地朋友們傳來的消息裏，我們可以知道他們演出的方式正在日新月異。可憐他們鎭天爲着祖國爲着反侵略的宣傳而努力，那裏有一刻的工夫去硏究各種方式的藝術立塲，和如何才算藝術地使用了它。他們譬如是墾荒的先鋒隊，他們沒有時間來做地質的分析，種植的研究，因爲他們的前面還有不少艱苦的墾荒工作在期待着。可是不做硏究，那是一種缺陷，遺憾。要彌補這缺陷，遺憾，似乎祇有留在孤島上的我們，責無旁貸。可是這究竟是嘗試的事，誰幹？</p>
<p>記得遠在抗戰以前，歐陽予倩先生從蘇聯考察了回來，在導演「日出」裏曾經來了兩下子表演派的手法：一是半截透頂的裝置，一是沒鏡面的鏡子。前者增加了打樁造屋的實感，後者完成了特寫的鏡頭。當時確已引起人們的注意，可是後來在正式舞台上永沒有新的繼續。</p>
<p>現在，我們得感謝于伶先生，這决在「夜上海」裏居然做大胆的嘗試，嘗試了兩點：一是床上沒人，一是影子戲的採用。效果如何，我們不應事前私加妄測。現在想就理論上來個介紹：</p>
<p>從物體象徵講起</p>
<p>講演戲而提到「象徵」，我們總是聯想到京劇，因爲京劇無處不是象徵的演出。譬如一根馬鞭子，從馬夫牽來直到騎者上馬，完全把來當馬看待。上馬之後，指在背後，揮上幾揮，這便已是把來當做鞭子看待了。等到鏘鏘鏘溜了幾個趟子之後，唱詞念白之際，那鞭子也許就變成了手頭指指點點的一根短棒。不錯，這便呌做物體象徵的演出。但是，假使從此等處着眼，而想了解象徵的演出，那便眞是「緣木求魚」了。一鞭三用，這祇是象徵演出的表面。它自有別方面的可貴的藝術表演。</p>
<p>我們來舉個例罷：「走麥城」裏有一塲，專事描寫坐騎失陷難以前進的情况，那時幅幅恣態都能呌你贊美。我相信，假使眞在馬上，絕無此種表演。又如花杉下樓，中途還要突然來個摔下一交。顯着那樣的嬌娜。你說，假使眞在扶梯上，那便顯得多麼地笨拙？這是說象徵演技會有超過寫實所描寫的美。</p>
<p>再說譬如「坐宮」裹的「盜令」一塲，公主手裏的孩子當然祇能是假的。但是，即使可能的話，其實也是不要抱着眞的來得好。因爲那塲的主體是公主，爲了孩子，將會分去公主的主要成分。况且，你試想一想，假使公主抱着眞的孩子，公主的身段將如何地拙劣。這是說象徵的演出有時會　別加强主體。</p>
<p>現在，「夜上海」裏云姑的母親，本來是病在床上直到死去，可是現在那床上始終沒有人。這是採用了象微演出的手法：加强了云姑的主體表演，而給予云姑以超脫的描寫底美的表演的機會。</p>
<p>從意態象徵講起</p>
<p>就舞台演出說，假使所象微着的景象在可見的塲面以外，我們呌它意態象徵。影子戲的採用，其實就是採用了意態象徵的演出方法。</p>
<p>聽朋友們說：影子戲在內地用得很多，並且因爲綫條子硬，所以收着很好的效果。不過，在藝術觀點上正式地採用它，這還是第一次。其實，在電影裏，常用這種手法。劇情發展到哪一步，它就會來這麼一連串的速寫的素描鏡頭。現在的影子戲，就相當於這類的鏡頭。</p>
<p>一般人常以爲寫實與象微是兩個絕然不易和諧的手法，允其是物體象微。這决的試騐，可以解决這問題的一部分。在介紹兩點新穎技巧的嘗試之外，特地提起一個注意。</p>
<p>今日爲上海劇藝社公演「夜上海」特輯「雨過天靑」暫停</p>
<h3>我怕吳姬</h3>
<p>— 藍蘭</p>
<p>在許多壓迫，許多顧忌之下，孤島上的戲劇界正感到劇本恐慌的時候，我們又看見了于伶先生底新作「夜上海」。怎能不使人興奮？</p>
<p>榮幸得很，我扮飾過「女子公寓」裏的佩佩，「花濺淚」裹的米米，現在又要扮「夜上海」裹的吳姬了。也巧得很，在同一個時期內，我拍攝「女子公寓」，導演「花濺淚」，上演「夜上海」。在這三個劇本常中，佩佩這角色比較使人生厭，她終日只知道爭風吃醋，鈎心鬥角計畫着，怎樣才能爭取一個更好更舒適的生活，來作一個更出色的寄生蟲。像這樣的女人，未免太侮辱了許多優秀的婦女了！米米就比較的可憐。她想掙扎，想冋上，她的本身並沒有罪，而社會指示她的過路却是沉淵，在假母底虐待，社會底壓迫，跟男性底勾引之下，結果她走上自殺之路。至於「夜上海裹的吳姬，我以爲她是可愛而値得同情的。作者將他彫畫的那麼深刻，那樣顯著。她並不是一個特殊的人物，在上海這四千多舞女中，她也是其中的一個。像她這樣的生活，一如環繞在我們底週圍，也是我們所熟習的都市婦女生活底一種典型。我們可以聽得到，看得見，也可以想像得出。她底生活經騐超過了「花濺淚」中的四個舞女。她遭逢過虐待，受過欺凌，生活也許逼過她去自殺，去浪蕩，去隨胎，去受騙；凡是不幸的舞女所嘗試過的，畸零悽悲的故事，在劇中的她底生活姿態上都顯現着。悽慘的經騐使她整個的人都麻木了。只是以「舞」作她生活的職業。爲了活，她勸雲姑——這孤苦無依的小女孩，爲了母病，爲了不使人將她姐弟兩個被趕出去睡馬路——去做野雞，也敎馮鳳——這美術專門學校的高材生——去跳舞。是的，她是這樣故的。</p>
<p>親切的觀衆們，我不想騙你們。在我排練這角色的時候，經過導演朱端鈞先生的詳細分析與指示之下，我怕吳姬，我怕她怕得發冷，我想喊無聲，我想哭無淚，我發呆，發痴，胸懷裏始終橫着一件大而沉重的塊物。這種「內心」的角色，這種浮面裏層的生活太悲慘了。</p>
<p>敬愛的觀衆們，我還要吿訴你們，我們這一羣，愛好戲劇的一羣，爲了要團結地更堅强，爲了要工作地更緊張，而決定了這决的長期公演。我們這第一次的見面禮一定不能壞，是的，我們決不能讓它失敗。因爲在過去有關心我們的觀衆，鼓勵我們的友朋，所以我們靠着這些可靠的氣力，正如導演先生所說的，我們會廢寢忘食的硏究，思索，用功，排練。但是我們還要進一步的要求，敬愛的觀衆們，親切的朋友們給我更多的更嚴正的愛護和批評，讓我們手携着手的本着劇作者，導演者苦心來鞭策着，警惕着，使舞台放光，將社會的黑暗驅遂。</p>

<h3>Torrential Rains Cause Disaster, Turning Land into a Watery Realm; Japanese Offensive in Southeastern Shanxi Greatly Frustrated; Maintaining Transportation Lines Extremely Difficult for Japanese Mechanized Units; Chinese Forces in Southern Shanxi Fiercely Attack Xia County, Surrounding the County Seat</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to travelers arriving here from Shanxi, the Japanese offensive aimed at "purging" the entire southeastern region of Shanxi has been entirely submerged due to unusually heavy rainfall. At least two divisions of a certain Japanese army, using mechanized units to maintain transportation routes, are now finding it extremely difficult to maintain these routes, as the countryside has become a vast quagmire. The rain is continuing to fall, and guerrilla forces in the area are extremely active. It is widely believed that the Japanese army will suffer terrible losses or face the risk of running out of supplies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: In the area south of Tongbai and north of Sui County, heavy losses have resulted from days of chaotic fighting. The Japanese strategy of "divide and conquer," deploying units of three to five hundred infantry, artillery, and cavalry to encircle and attack the Chinese from multiple directions, has been met with fierce resistance from the resolute and brave Chinese defenders, resulting in numerous casualties. The Japanese army in Sui County even launched an offensive against the Chinese Lishan position with mechanized units, constantly bombing Chinese positions. The Chinese army, considering the positions of Gaocheng, Jiangjiahe, and Lishan completely destroyed and no longer defensible, withdrew yesterday afternoon to the new defense line of Huantan Town, Tangxianbo, and Wu'an, waiting for an opportunity to intercept the enemy. Currently, the Yaji River has been recaptured by the Chinese army, which is advancing south to flank the Japanese forces in the Jiangjiahe and Liujiahe areas. Chinese forces in the Dabie Mountains have established contact with the guerrillas in the Tongbai Mountains, launching a pincer attack against the Japanese. The Japanese army, venturing deep into the Wanshan Valley, will likely repeat the disaster of the Suizao campaign in May. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports from Hubei reaching here, the Han River, one of the main tributaries of the Yangtze River, has recently experienced high water levels, greatly disadvantaging the Japanese. The Japanese army has been forced to build dikes in the areas of Duobaowan and Kongjiachang (transliteration). Two attempts by the Japanese to cross the river have reportedly failed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Three to four thousand Japanese soldiers attacking from eastern Xia County have suffered heavy casualties from continuous attacks by the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought fiercely for a full day and night the day before yesterday, completely routing the Japanese. The majority of the Japanese forces fled towards Wenxi Anyun, while a portion retreated into Xia County. Xia County has now been surrounded by the Chinese and is under intense attack. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese army reinforced with over a thousand soldiers on the 4th, attacking north of Huayangzi. The Chinese forces withdrew from Changshou Town, awaiting an opportunity to attack. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: On the evening of the 4th, a small unit of a certain Chinese division launched an attack against the Japanese at Tianwangdu on the west bank of the Fu River. The Japanese were extremely panicked and, from the evening of the 4th to dawn on the 5th, blindly fired over two hundred artillery shells at the east bank of the Fu River, while simultaneously spraying machine-gun fire. By noon, the Chinese army had safely withdrawn to the east bank. Gunfire could still be heard from the west bank, demonstrating the extent of the Japanese fear of the Chinese. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Active Chinese Forces on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Routes</h3>
<p>Jinhua: The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been repeatedly sabotaged by the Chinese, posing a great threat to the Japanese. Over the past three days, the Japanese forces garrisoning various strongholds have been continuously reinforced. Additionally, over a thousand Japanese soldiers are currently urgently repairing the Chongde-Tongxiang Highway and are engaged in fierce fighting with a certain Chinese unit. Furthermore, the Japanese forces have also been continuously reinforced in the Sujia area over the past two days. The Japanese forces in Nanxun and Wuzhen have also received reinforcements. Units of the Chinese army are preparing to launch separate fierce attacks. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces Attack Jiangmen and Xinhui, Achieving Considerable Successes</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Chinese army has been launching continuous attacks against the Japanese forces in Jiangmen and Xinhui, achieving considerable successes. The Japanese soldiers are entrenched in fortifications, using artillery to defend themselves. The Chinese army is continuing to clear out the enemy while also assisting farmers in various villages with harvesting. The people are extremely inspired and are contributing even more to the war effort. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships off the Zhejiang Coast Shell the Shore</h3>
<p>Jinhua: At 6:00 AM on the 6th, three Japanese warships were spotted in the waters off Chanshi Pu (southeast of Xiaoshan). At 1:00 PM, one of them, under the cover of two Japanese aircraft, approached the Shibu pier and shelled the shore. The Chinese defense forces returned fire. By 4:00 PM, the number of Japanese warships had increased to four, suggesting an intention to land. Several Japanese aircraft also dropped five bombs on Shibu at 12:00 PM on the 6th and strafed with machine guns, resulting in three civilian deaths and three injuries, and the destruction of over ten civilian houses. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Over Twenty Japanese Aircraft Attacked Yichang Twice Yesterday, Dropping Incendiary and Explosive Bombs; A British Jardine Matheson Merchant Ship Was Sunk</h3>
<p>(Yichang) At around 5:00 AM and 1:00 PM on the 6th, over twenty Japanese aircraft in total attacked Yichang in two waves, dropping many incendiary and explosive bombs. The British ship "Jiahe," of Jardine Matheson, and the "Xinchanghe" which was clearly marked and moored at the lower wharf of the British company were sunk and destroyed. The Asia Oil Depot, a Western merchant, was also hit by several bombs. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received today, eighteen Japanese aircraft in two groups raided Guilin yesterday afternoon. Three Japanese aircraft also flew to Yichang yesterday, scattering leaflets. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Kunming) Twenty Japanese aircraft attempted to raid Kunming yesterday, but turned back midway due to adverse weather conditions. This is the second failed Japanese air raid on Kunming in the past two days, as a squadron of Japanese aircraft also came to attack the day before yesterday, but failed to achieve its objective due to adverse weather. Although Kunming is making every effort to evacuate residents, the population continues to increase. The pre-war population was 120,000, but it has now increased to 200,000. Last month, Kunming evacuated 2,033 residents, but 5,421 arrived, including 69 foreigners. The authorities anticipate that Kunming will be at risk of being bombed after the end of the two seasons at the end of September, and therefore plan to launch an evacuation campaign starting next week, encouraging residents to leave voluntarily. Catholic groups have already opened a first-aid hospital this week to prepare for future air raids. The hospital can accommodate 100 people and is currently serving as a clinic for the poor. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) At around 7:00 AM this morning, three Japanese aircraft flew into northern Fujian from Jiangxi, dropping six bombs on Jianyang, destroying over ten civilian houses. Six Japanese aircraft attacked Longxi twice on the 4th, dropping over ten bombs on the urban area. Two or three Japanese warships are operating off the mouth of the Min River, moving about unpredictably. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Zhi, the Chongqing Garrison Commander, has sent representatives to the embassies of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium to convey the Chinese side's sympathy for the unfortunate incidents in which all the embassies suffered damage during the Japanese bombing on the 4th and 5th of this month. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers to Resume Publication Soon</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to officials here, Chinese newspapers that ceased publication four months ago as a result of the first major air raid on Chongqing are now scheduled to resume publication on the 13th of this month. All technical equipment has been moved to safe areas outside the city. On the day that the various newspapers resume publication, the "Chongqing United Daily" will cease publication. However, due to the high price of imported paper, all newspapers will no longer use newsprint but will instead use domestically produced earthen paper. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>University Presidents Appeal to Britain and America for Active Assistance to China; Request Suspension of Anglo-Japanese Tokyo Negotiations; Support for Chinese Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese university presidents today jointly telegraphed the President of Oxford University in the United Kingdom, requesting that he forward the appeal to leaders and the public of the British education community, urging the British government to suspend the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and to provide all possible assistance to China, including support for Chinese legal tender. Furthermore, the Lanzhou branch of the International Peace Movement today also telegraphed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, making the same appeal. However, this telegram also urged the British government to abolish trade with Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The presidents of sixteen major Chinese universities yesterday jointly telegraphed Nicholas Murray Butler, the President of Columbia University in the United States, requesting that the United States take more concrete measures, such as prohibiting the supply of military materials to Japan and providing active financial or other assistance to China. At the same time, the university presidents also telegraphed the President of Oxford University in the United Kingdom, requesting that he advise the British government to abandon the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. In addition to being sent to the presidents of Columbia University in the United States and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, these joint telegrams were also sent to the presidents of other universities in the United Kingdom and the United States through the presidents of the two universities. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an editorial this morning urging Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude an anti-aggression pact as soon as possible, stating that although the negotiations in Moscow will directly affect the situation in Europe, they will also have an important indirect impact on the situation in the Far East. If the three-nation anti-aggression pact is completed soon, the European situation will be temporarily eased, and Britain and France will be able to shift their focus to the Far East. At the same time, Japan will no longer be able to use the pressure of Germany and Italy in Europe to coerce Britain and France in China. The newspaper also stated that even if the content of the three-nation pact does not include the Far East, the spirit of cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will inevitably extend to the Far East, and collective security in the Pacific will be rapidly realized as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to well-informed Chinese sources here, the general public in China is quite skeptical about the possibility of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. They believe that the announcement made by Japan after the recent meeting between the German and Italian ambassadors is merely a form of threat intended to exert pressure on democratic countries, particularly Britain. Since the United States announced the abolition of the treaty, the attitude of the United Kingdom at the Tokyo conference has gradually become firmer, and military representatives from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold staff talks in Moscow. Therefore, Japan now wants to use the possibility of joining the Axis military alliance to force Britain to make concessions and adopt a more conciliatory attitude at the Tokyo conference. Japan is already experiencing considerable difficulties in the war against China and is unwilling to attempt to become involved in a European conflict in which it has no interest.

<h3>Hengchen Area Special Party Department Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>Hengyang: The Hengchen Area Special Party Department, with Yi Long appointed as the Central Government's special envoy and Cai Xianjun as the secretary-general, held its inaugural meeting at a certain location in Hengyang at 7:00 AM this morning. Li Yuyao, a member of the Hunan Provincial Party Department, was sent by the Central Government to Hengyang to administer the oath. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Islam and the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch recently reported that the China Islamic National Salvation Association held its annual meeting in Chongqing. President Chiang Kai-shek personally attended and delivered a speech, praising Islam's love of justice and the great fearless spirit of defending the truth. This is certainly welcome news to Muslims. Unfortunately, the report was not detailed enough, so I would like to add a few words.</p>
<p>Islam has been transmitted to China for over a thousand years, and there are about 50 million converts. Throughout the generations, there have been many outstanding figures who have made many contributions to politics and culture. Even just considering the correction of the calendar, its contributions are everlasting, but few know that this is due to Islam. This is because the Islamic spirit values sincerity and modesty and does not like to publicize itself. Therefore, its history is said not to be short. The number of believers is not said to be small, but few outside the religion understand it. They only know that it prohibits pork. Islam is indeed one of the great religions of the world. If its teachings were only about this simple prohibition, with no special spirit to maintain it, it would not be so great and could not make people sincerely turn to it and make it last so long! President Chiang's praise has its basis and is not accidental. The spirit of resistance in China today is consistent with Islamic teachings.</p>
<p>The name "Islam" only exists in China. Everywhere else in the world, it is called "Islam." "Islam" means the religion of peace; the original meaning of the word is peace, the way to peace. The teachings of "Islam" are to completely obey the commands of God and not to offend people, so as to achieve peace. Therefore, in the Islamic "Quran," God is called the Lord of Peace: its main purpose is to encourage believers to develop their noble and beautiful abilities and to maintain peace in the world. According to Islamic classics, God revealed to the Holy Prophet Muhammad, who transmitted it to the believers; the goal is to correct the mind, cultivate the body, and save the world. The active aspects include doing all kinds of good deeds, and the passive aspects include refraining from all kinds of evil. Belief must be firm, and practice must be firm, without sloppiness or pretense, in order to nip evil in the bud; therefore, even if non-Muslims prepare food other than pork, it is not touched. Its rules are strict and do not allow for any deviation, such as not marrying outside the religion, praying five times a day from morning to evening, fasting for one month every year, and making a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca once in a lifetime. After death, one must be buried within three days, without clothes or coffins, wrapped in plain silk and covered with a bottomless outer coffin, so that the body is in direct contact with the earth, so as to seek quick decay. All of this is a glimpse of the Islamic spirit, which must be followed by believers, but the special spirit of Islam lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>What is the special spirit of Islam? It is that all believers are of one heart, forgetting their own interests because of their strong faith in God. Muslims recognize that there is a great power in the universe that created heaven and earth, nurtured all things, and is great in benevolence and compassion, perfect in virtue and omnipotence, without form or place, called "Allah" (in Arabic), which translates as God. Man's destiny is predetermined by Him, and man's good and evil are judged and rewarded by Him. Life on earth is for serving this one and only God. Therefore, our bodies and lives are not our own, but are given by God to those who practice the Great Way. Our assets are also not our own, but are given by God to those who relieve the poor and benefit others. We must do our best to fulfill what God has revealed to us; even if we lose our bodies, our lives, or our assets, we will not regret it. Belief and practice must be united. Belief without practice is just a formality. It must be reflected in action to be true belief. Thomas Carlyle, a famous British historian, once called this "refusing self" and "annihilating self" in the chapter on "Islam" in his book "Heroes and Hero Worship."</p>
<p>Since Muslims sacrifice "self," they see all mankind as equal under God's rule and should be treated fairly. Even slaves should not be subjected to violence or unreasonableness. For this reason, Muslims view aggression and bullying as the public enemy of mankind, as not allowed by religious teachings, and regard stopping violence as an obligation to God. Aggression and violence violate the essence of "Islam." If they are allowed to run rampant without being punished, God's Great Way will be destroyed, and people's lives will be disturbed. Believers must not cherish their own lives and money in order to eliminate violence and maintain peace, but must all go to the great righteousness in order to achieve great integrity. President Chiang's praise of Islam for its love of justice and its great fearless spirit of defending the truth is the ultimate statement of understanding of Islam. In the "Quran," there is a warning to its believers:</p>
<p>"Do not say that those who die in the cause of God are dead, but they are alive, but you do not perceive it."</p>
<p>"Fight against those who fight you in order to defend the Great Way; do not transgress. Indeed, God does not love transgressors. Kill the enemy whenever you encounter them, and drive them out to restore your former residence. The poison of persecution is worse than being killed. Under the forbidden court (the Heavenly Gate of Mecca), do not fight unless the enemy strikes first; if they fight you, then you may kill them; that is the retribution of the rebels. If they stop, then stop. God is most forgiving and most merciful. Fight the enemy until persecution ceases and the Way returns to truth. Once they have stopped, do not hate them, but only hate those who abuse them... Recreate as they created you!"</p>
<p>"Spend your wealth to defend the Great Way, and do not bring about your own destruction with your own hands."</p>
<p>"Fight in the cause of God, knowing that God is all-hearing and all-knowing. Whoever makes a good contribution to God, God will reward him richly, and God will receive him greatly."</p>
<p>"Why do you not fight in the cause of God and to save the weak men, women, and children!"</p>
<p>"Even if you are wounded in battle, the enemy will not be spared from injury... God will only distinguish His Muslims (those who believe in the Way) in order to reward those who have contributed to martyrdom; if you encounter danger on the expedition, do not be discouraged, do not be afraid, do not submit, and God will surely reward those who can endure!"</p>
<p>There are many more such admonitions in the "Quran," which need not be listed exhaustively. This kind of spirit is impossible to find in other religions. If everyone could adhere to these precepts and put them into practice, there would be no one in the world who would dare to rely on strength to bully the weak in order to satisfy their ambitions; there would be no one who would be willing to endure humiliation and live as a slave; how could peace and order not be maintained! From this, we know that in the past, Muhammad fought hard with his bare hands, and in less than twenty years, he created an unprecedented great cause in the world. He and his followers had this great fearless spirit, which was the basis of his success. After the end of the European War, Turkey was in a slump, and strong enemies were pressing in, almost leading to its demise; then General Kemal Atatürk raised his arms and called out, and the whole country responded. Not only did he preserve the devastated land, but he has now regained his status as a powerful nation in the world. He is indeed an Islamic country. In today's China, General Bai Chongxi is indeed an outstanding example of this spirit.</p>
<p>The world's commentators often criticize Islam for this; they also say that Muhammad preached with "the Quran in his left hand and the sword in his right." But this is not a fault, the fault lies in seeing the sword but not the Quran. Some also belittle Islam because of its rituals and customs, but their views are truly shallow; however, the friction between Muslims and non-Muslims caused by this belittling must be guided and eliminated, and cannot be ignored because of its shallowness. People like Carlyle, with the torch-like eyes of a historian, saw through the truth of Islam and praised it without the slightest disparagement; and like the Japanese Kato Jibuchi, in his book "History of World Religions," praised Islam as a religion suitable for modern times; this kind of view is not only beneficial to Islam.</p>
<p>China has 50 million Muslims, and they are distributed in the southwest, mostly, and in the northwest, densely. The southwest and northwest are the basis for China's war of resistance. With 50 million people upholding Islam, the contribution to the war of resistance will be immeasurably great, which we firmly believe. It should be known that the powerful also know what to fear, using names and rituals to deceive, building churches, and enticing believers, trying to control them and make them do their bidding; there have been frequent reports of this kind of news recently. This is not allowed by religious teachings, but it can also be used to prove the greatness of Islam, which is feared and coveted. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the believers will be able to promote their teachings in a timely manner, that those outside the religion will respect their teachings, and that they will be as harmonious as water and milk, moving forward hand in hand on the road of resistance and reconstruction, so that Islam's contribution to the country will not be just the strength of 50 million people.</p>
<h3>Britain and America Consider Dispatching Fleets to the Far East, Concentrating in Hawaii and Singapore Respectively, to Jointly Blockade Japan When Necessary</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reports, President Roosevelt has decided to dispatch all or part of the U.S. fleet to the Hawaiian Islands as a warning to Japan. Reliable sources believe that this move will not be implemented immediately, but it is sufficient to indicate that President Roosevelt intends to take a stronger policy toward Japan during the congressional recess. The State Department stated that it had no comment on the President's plan to dispatch the fleet to the Hawaiian Islands. The early return of the fleet from various ports in the Atlantic to the Pacific was regarded as a warning from the United States to Japan, indicating that the United States was closely watching Japan's rights and interests in the Far East. Observers said that since that time, the situation in China has not improved, and there have been countless incidents of American people being insulted and attacked by Japanese troops. The State Department has repeatedly expressed concern about the situation in China in the past week. The United States has protested to Japan in Tokyo and China against Japan's instigation of an anti-British movement, fearing that it may expand to include an anti-American movement. Thirty-five American churches have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft in the past five months. Although the news of dispatching the fleet to the Hawaiian Islands has not been confirmed, military experts believe that the United States has been making military preparations in strategically important locations along the Pacific coast in recent months. President Roosevelt's plan to dispatch all or part of the fleet to Hawaii was reported after British Prime Minister Chamberlain warned Japan that it was not impossible for Britain to dispatch a fleet to the Far East that was superior to the Japanese navy. Some believe that if Britain decides to dispatch a fleet to the Far East, President Roosevelt will take parallel action, at least dispatching the U.S. fleet to the Hawaiian Islands. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The forceful circles here were deeply moved by British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement to the House of Commons on Friday that Britain intends to take naval action to deal with Japan's intimidation. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech indicated the depth of British resentment against Japan and that Britain will adopt a stronger attitude toward Japan. This trend is influenced by Washington's abolition of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. Some were shocked that Britain made a threat to dispatch a fleet to the Far East at a time when the situation in Europe was tense. Naval experts said that the German navy only accounted for one-third of the British navy's strength, while the French navy was on par with Italy's, so it was no problem for Britain to dispatch most of its fleet to the Far East if necessary. Military circles said that Britain had long studied the action of the British fleet using Singapore as a base and the U.S. fleet using Hawaii as a base to jointly blockade Japan. This action may not require war and could immediately cut off Japan's main supplies, causing Japan to change its policies. Some observers believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain's threat that Britain was considering dispatching the navy to the Far East already contained this meaning, and that President Roosevelt's decision to dispatch all or part of the U.S. fleet to Hawaii was viewed in the same way. Japan's continued insults have caused not only the abolition of the treaty, but also the U.S. public is ready to take stronger action, or jointly blockade Japan with Britain. Currently, the general view is to impose an arms embargo on Japan to determine whether this action can cause Japan to change its current policies. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Announce Downing of Multiple Japanese Aircraft; Japanese-Manchukuoan Forces Repeatedly Repelled in Attacks; Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Remain East of the Khalkhin Gol River</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The General Staff of the Soviet-Mongolian forces in Outer Mongolia recently issued a communiqué stating that from July 26th to August 4th, the Japanese-Manchukuoan forces launched repeated attacks, all of which were heavily damaged and repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian forces using artillery and machine guns. They maintained their original positions on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol River. During the same period, multiple air battles occurred, resulting in the destruction of sixty-seven Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft, while the Soviet-Mongolian side only lost six. (1) On July 28th, five Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft were shot down, with no losses on the Soviet-Mongolian side. (2) On July 29th, several air battles took place over Outer Mongolian territory, resulting in thirty-two Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft being shot down, while the Soviet-Mongolian side only lost four. (3) On July 31st, five Japanese-Manchukuoan fighter planes were shot down, with the Soviet-Mongolian air force losing one. (4) On August 1st, Japanese-Manchukuoan bombers invaded Outer Mongolian airspace. The Soviet-Mongolian forces immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns and dispatched fighter planes to engage. The Japanese-Manchukuoan side lost two aircraft, with the rest fleeing. One Soviet-Mongolian air force pilot sustained minor injuries. In the afternoon of the same day, Japanese-Manchukuoan bombers attempted to bomb Soviet-Mongolian positions again, but were repelled by anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes. (5) At 8:00 PM on August 2nd, several Soviet-Mongolian bombers flew to the enemy side and bombed their airfield, safely returning to their base after destroying three enemy aircraft. (6) On August 3rd, Japanese-Manchukuoan bombers, under fighter escort, attempted to drop bombs on the Soviet-Mongolian forces, but were repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian air force, which destroyed two of their bombers. (7) On August 4th, two more air battles occurred over Outer Mongolian territory, resulting in ten Japanese-Manchukuoan aircraft being shot down, while the Soviet-Mongolian side only lost one.

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Stalled for Several Days; Japan Issues Threatening Statement; Saying Further Delays Will Lead to Intensified Anti-British Movement; London Times Explains Ground for British Warning to Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today prominently published Chamberlain's speech, but without any criticism so far. It is reported that representatives of the Tianjin Japanese authorities participating in the Tokyo conference have developed "an unpleasant impression" regarding Halifax's speech in the House of Lords. According to them, the British Foreign Secretary's speech showed British infidelity and slandered the spirit of compromise between Arita and Craigie. The British representatives have not received instructions from their government, so the Anglo-Japanese conference has been stalled for four days, with no immediate prospect of resumption. Britain is deliberately delaying for its own convenience, which shows its infidelity. If Britain continues with this delaying tactic, the Japanese military authorities will inevitably take countermeasures to deal with the new situation two days later. Halifax's statement that banning the anti-British movement in North China has become an important factor in the progress of the Tokyo conference, and that the Japanese military is responsible for suppressing the anti-British movement in North China, is completely contrary to the facts. Because Britain has always adhered to a pro-Chiang policy, refusing to hand over Chinese-owned silver deposits, refusing to ban the circulation of legal tender in the British concession in Tianjin, and disturbing the peaceful order and economic situation of the people in North China, and actions that harm the interests of the people of North China, it should bear all the responsibility for the anti-British movement that is now spreading in North China. If Britain abandons its policy of hostility towards the people of North China and corrects its attitude towards the police and economic problems in North China, the anti-British clamor in North China will naturally disappear. Therefore, Britain should bear full responsibility for the current anti-British movement in North China. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, issuing a warning to Japan, The Sunday Times recently published an editorial commenting on it, saying, "At this moment, the most pressing diplomatic issue is the problem constituted by Japan. Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons before the adjournment is focused on this, and its nature is a clear warning, not a threat to Japan. Even a politician as moderate and cautious in his speech as Chamberlain has stated that the insults suffered by British nationals at the hands of Japanese soldiers have made his blood boil, and that while the British naval fleet in the Far East is not as powerful as Japan's, it may be possible to send the fleet to the Far East under certain circumstances. Japanese politicians who still know how to weigh the pros and cons must listen, otherwise it is unwise. What is regrettable is that the Japanese military in China are too excited, not only are they not controlled by the Tokyo government, but their momentum is enough to control the moderates, and even the moderates are in constant fear of being assassinated by the extremists. This situation is unique to Japan, which shows that the country's foreign policy is at risk of going off the rails at any time." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Demonstrators in Anti-British Movement Chant Anti-American Slogans; Denouncing U.S. President's Abolition of Trade Treaty; Anti-British Slogans Fill Streets of Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News received here today indicates that the anti-British movement in North China has now turned against the Americans. During demonstrations in Shijiazhuang, anti-American slogans were chanted and anti-American speeches were delivered. The demonstrators denounced U.S. President Roosevelt's action of abolishing the U.S.-Japan trade treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The anti-British movement in Beiping has become rampant again. New slogans denouncing Britain have been posted in the city. Slogans have been found in all public places, such as public organizations, and in Chang'an Street there are many. Even on the trunks of trees and telephone poles in the Dongjiaominxiang area, hundreds of these slogans have been pasted. Some are written in English, such as "Oppose Britain" and "Exclude Britain," while those written in Chinese have a stronger literary flavor, such as "Down with Britain's malicious aggression," "Down with Britain's malicious imperialist policy," "To liberate the Chinese nation, we must first overthrow Britain," "Asia is for Asians," and "Aspiring yellow people will not be British slaves," etc. However, the general public is not very interested in these slogans. Some slogans have been torn down. According to those who have traveled to Beidaihe, there is no real progress in the anti-British movement there. The committee organizing the movement went to various shops in the town and forced them to send one representative to participate in the mass anti-British rally. Otherwise, they would pay one yuan. Most shops paid it, and the committee used the money to hire people to participate in the rally. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to an American businessman who arrived here from Shijiazhuang, British expatriates in Shijiazhuang said that after U.S. President Roosevelt announced the abolition of the trade treaty with Japan, an anti-American movement broke out there. However, there were no Americans in Shijiazhuang at the time, so no unfortunate incidents occurred. Not many people participated in the anti-American movement, and they all carried various flags with anti-American slogans. According to the traveler, in the middle of July, the anti-British demonstrations in Shijiazhuang were even more serious than the anti-American movement. The children of the British clergyman Outremon were almost innocently injured. According to people from Taiyuan, the British expatriates who were planning to retreat are still staying there, apparently because railway traffic is blocked by floods, so they have to delay slightly. Also, it is reported that 260 Chinese parishioners of the Taiyuan Baptist Church were arrested by the Japanese. Of these, the Japanese accused 16 of organizing anti-Japanese activities and detained them, while the others have been released. Also, under the instigation of the Japanese, the Beiping "Municipal Government" is now planning to eradicate British educational influence in North China and is warning Chinese parents to withdraw their children from schools run by the British. However, there is a severe lack of schools outside, so it is extremely difficult. At the same time, British clergymen here have now received warnings to stop their missionary work. Those who continue to work in churches or church schools have also received warnings not to take actions that hinder the peace of North China. Police officers still visit the servants in British homes every day, urging them to leave as soon as possible. According to a Japanese military spokesman, there are at least 35,000 Chinese guerrillas linked to the British. Of these, 1,000 were killed and 100 captured by the Japanese in July after being swept away. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

At this point, the audience dispersed in the highest excitement and joy. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Heavy Rains in North China; Disaster Signs Already Formed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to news here today, the floods caused by the recent heavy rains in North China have destroyed most of the crops. It is estimated that the flooded area covers 60 counties in Hebei, 15 counties in Henan, 6 counties in Shandong, and 10 counties in Chahar. The number of lives lost is quite large. The recently repaired northern section of the Pinghan Railway is again threatened by the collapse of twelve sections of the Yongding River embankment. The water depth in Changxindian reaches 20 feet. Many residents in many places have been forced to flee to higher ground, but they have not brought enough food, and some have brought no food at all, so they are in danger of starving to death. At the same time, the incidence of epidemics is increasing day by day. In Tongzhou, 500 of the 2,600 refugees have malaria, and food is extremely scarce. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin's Food Situation Worsens</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The food situation here is getting worse. This morning, the British Concession菜市 [Vegetable Market] only had a few dried slices of sweet potato, some cabbages that seemed to be rotten, and some leftover food. The asking price is almost unimaginable. No fish or meat is for sale. According to the vendors, the source has been cut off and they have to close their businesses. Milk and other牧場 [pasture] products are extremely rare. Lodging houses and small private restaurants have notified their customers that they can no longer provide meals. The supply of flour and rice in the British Concession is still sufficient. The situation in the French Concession菜市 is better because they have agreed with the Japanese authorities to allow five trucks to transport vegetables in every day. However, due to the butcher's strike, no meat is available. Some plan to buy food in the former German Concession, but it is extremely difficult to bring a small amount into the British Concession, so most people do not consider it. The British Concession currently has some canned food, but this comes from abroad and is very expensive due to foreign exchange, so it is not affordable for ordinary families.

<h3>Germany Unwilling to Rush into Conflict; Danzig Situation Temporarily Eases; Regarding the Treatment of Polish Customs Officers; City Council Makes Concessions to Polish Government</h3>
<p>Warsaw. Regarding the issue of the treatment of Polish customs officials in the free city of Danzig, the Polish government instructed its High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, last night to lodge a protest with the city council, demanding the revocation of the decree. The wording was extremely strong, and a reply was demanded within today. Sources here claim that the city council agreed to comply this morning and will submit a detailed reply next week. The Polish government replied that it hoped that the city council could satisfy Poland's demands. Authoritative observers here commented that the Danzig city council was fortunate to have made concessions, otherwise an armed conflict between Poland and Germany would have been almost inevitable. The details of the issue and the Polish government's 美教書 [ultimatum] are as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Officer Treatment Issue</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the Danzig City Council declared that it would only recognize the Polish customs officials belonging to the Polish Ministry of Finance and allow them to exercise their functions, while all those belonging to the Polish military authorities would be regarded as "border customs officials" and ordered to cease serving from noon on August 6th. If they resisted, they would be expelled and force would be used if necessary. Upon hearing this news, the Polish government instructed Chodacki to submit a note to the chairman of the city council, Greiser, last night. The main points were three: (1) Demand the revocation of the decree. (2) Demand a reply within today. (3) Declare that all Polish customs officials belonging to the military authorities have been instructed that if they are obstructed in the performance of their duties, they may use weapons. This morning, Greiser submitted a verbal reply to Chodacki, stating that the measures intended to be taken against the Polish customs officials were decided by lower-level officials and that the Free City authorities did not intend to implement them. Therefore, the service of all Polish customs officials would still be treated equally and not hindered. A detailed report will be submitted next Sunday, explaining the views of the Free City authorities on the general issues constituted by the customs officials. The crisis was thus temporarily calmed. People in political circles said that Poland is determined to maintain its right to manage the Danzig customs by all means. Although the city authorities have made concessions, the crisis has not disappeared. Germany is determined to have its way on the Danzig issue, the only question is when. Poland is determined to defend its rights and will not allow Danzig to be annexed by Germany. However, various friendly solutions that can be accepted by both sides are also prepared for discussion. It can be seen that the positions of both sides have not changed. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Britain Will Not Sit Idly By</p>
<p>German Violent Actions</p>
<p>(London) The Danzig issue and Germany's military preparations have been commented on by various newspapers, all saying that Britain will not sit idly by and watch Germany take any violent action. The Observer newspaper published a dispatch from its Warsaw correspondent, stating that [the Danzig issue has gradually become tense since last week, causing panic in Warsaw today. It is believed that the situation is approaching a breaking point. Diplomats from various countries have also canceled their vacations and stayed in Warsaw. This morning, it was also heard that German National Socialists in Danzig planned to kidnap several Polish customs officials at the border between the city and East Prussia. However, after receiving orders from Berlin and consulting with the leader of the National Socialists in Danzig and the German military commander, they did not take any action. The city council also made concessions to Poland. However, spokespersons for the Polish government believe that the statement issued by London is "overly optimistic" in content. In fact, the crisis has not been eliminated. The Polish military authorities have taken various measures to prepare for the worst.] (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Office personnel were busy all day yesterday due to the dispute between Poland and Danzig. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, although on vacation, never stopped talking on the phone. News came in the afternoon that the situation had eased, and many believed that the crisis had been temporarily avoided. It is widely believed that Danzig's retreat was purely because Germany did not want to start a conflict this week, as mobilization has not yet been completed. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>German Mechanized Forces</p>
<p>To Hold Large-Scale Maneuvers</p>
<p>(Berlin) South of Berlin along the Elbe River, unprecedented large-scale maneuvers of mechanized forces will begin next week. Although its detailed deployment is still kept secret, its preparations show that this is a trial mobilization of mechanized forces. The requisition of cars and the lack of gasoline are now causing residents anxiety, as it is feared that car fuel will be entirely controlled by government officials. As Germany's military strength has approached its highest level of preparedness, anti-Polish propaganda has suddenly been moved to the front pages of newspapers. Important positions in each newspaper are filled with news of Poland's abuse of the German minority. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Polish Restoration Anniversary: Army Inspector-General's Speech: Respond to Violence with Violence, Determined Not to Abandon International Obligations, Swearing an Oath to Struggle for National Prestige</h3>
<p>Krakow, Poland - Previously, at the beginning of the European War in 1914, the Polish national hero, the late Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, organized volunteer troops to join the Austrian army and fight against Russia, and in return, the two countries of Germany and Austria recognized Polish independence. Later, after the end of the European War, the plan for the restoration of the country was completed. Today is the 25th anniversary of the departure of the first group of volunteers from this city. Army Inspector-General, General Śmigły-Rydz, personally presided over the ceremony and delivered an important speech, the main points of which are as follows: 1. Respond to violence with violence. 2. Poland has no intention of aggression, but all aggressions, whether direct or indirect, must be resisted. 3. The Free City of Danzig is the economic lifeline of Poland and must be safeguarded. The gist of his speech is recorded as follows: "August 6th is the starting point of our country's independence, and also a new page in our country's history. Without this day, our country would still be in darkness. Anyone who uses violence against our motherland must rise up and resist. It is absolutely impossible to seek help from other countries. In short, respond to violence with violence. Our country maintains peace and is determined to resist aggression. If it is said that country A has the right to demand and take, and country B only has the obligation to give everything away, no force can force us to obey this kind of statement. Our country has no intention of encroaching on any country. If other countries want to harm our rights and interests and infringe upon our country's dignity, whether direct or indirect, they must be resisted. "Our attitude can be understood by all friendly countries, and they have clearly expressed their own attitudes, which I am happy to state. ] At this point, General Śmigły-Rydz clenched his fist and struck the table, saying, "The Free City of Danzig has been linked to our country for centuries and is the lifeline of our economic structure. I hereby clearly state that our country will never unilaterally abandon its international obligations. What our country does in the Free City of Danzig is to respond to the other party's actions and has no other purpose." After General Śmigły-Rydz finished his speech, the audience applauded enthusiastically and raised their hands to take an oath, roughly saying, "We solemnly swear that we are willing to fight for the permanent power of Poland in wartime until victory is achieved. In peacetime, we are willing to unite the strength of all citizens and cooperate sincerely." After hearing about General Śmigły-Rydz's speech, political figures here were very satisfied and said that Poland's attitude has now been clearly explained. The importance of this public's resolute expression in the capacity of the leader of the army is self-evident. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Göring Inspects the Junkers Factory, Convenes Workers for a Speech, Exaggerating Air Force Strength</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Air Minister General Göring went to Dessau City today to inspect the Junkers aircraft manufacturing plant and immediately convened all the workers to deliver a speech, in which he said: "We are now actively expanding our military power so that when other countries force us to go to war, we can calmly respond and achieve victory. Looking back to last September, the reason why we were able to restore the freedom of the Germans in the Sudetenland was simply because we possessed a new and powerful air force that other countries did not have. Now, the same remarks as last year have been issued from across the English Channel, threatening the German nation. It has become customary for Britain to interfere in the interests of other countries without any reason, which is actually the reason for the war. For us, although we do not want to threaten Britain, if that country hinders our progress everywhere, the consequences will endanger world peace, and the responsibility should be borne by Britain. At present, our air force is strong and the amount of wheat stored is abundant, and we are no longer afraid of foreign blockades, but we do not want war either, because I know the meaning of war deeply. The responsibility that any politician can bear is the most important responsibility for war, but if we are forced to fight, we will surely win. In short, we will never allow anyone to deny the interests of our country's survival, neither by force nor by sweet words." (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>A German Submarine Fleet Arrives in Sweden</h3>

<h3>British and French Representatives Go to the Soviet Union to Participate in the Three-Nation Military Talks: Important Points of Contention Have Been Resolved: Strang Flew Back to London Yesterday</h3>
<p>(London) The British and French military delegations set off from here this afternoon to Moscow to hold staff talks with the Soviet military authorities. This group is composed of senior staff officers of the British and French naval, land, and air forces. The special ship Exeter City will sail abroad, with the Soviet red flag hoisted. It will not follow the usual route through the Kiel Canal, but will bypass the Baltic Sea, which is about two days longer than the usual commercial route. After landing in Leningrad, they will take the train directly to Moscow to begin talks with the Soviet representatives, led by General Voroshilov. This talk is a preliminary contact before the establishment of the British, French, and Soviet tripartite agreement. The Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, personally went to the station to see them off today, shaking hands with the British and French representatives one by one and talking happily. The British chief representative, Admiral Plunkett, told roadside interviewers that he had no right to speak, but perhaps he could report something when he returned home. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It is reported that Strang, the British Foreign Office's special envoy to attend the British, French, and Soviet conference in order to establish a tripartite agreement, will fly back to London today. After that, British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will continue negotiations. According to reliable sources, important differences in opinion have now been resolved, but the definition of the term "indirect aggression" is still a matter for further discussion. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin met with the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union today to discuss the procedures for receiving the British and French military delegations. It is expected that the British, French, and Soviet negotiations may not have any development until Strang personally reports the situation to London. Approximately, the military talks will temporarily become more prominent than the political talks. Without considerable progress in the military talks, the British, French, and Soviet convention is unlikely to have a substantial decision. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Staff members of the British, French, and Soviet general staff departments will hold talks in Moscow. The British and French military delegations boarded a ship at Tilbury Port this afternoon and went to the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Why Isn't My Wife as Passionate as Before?</h3>
<p>Please examine yourself for any morbid conditions before complaining about your wife!</p>
<p>Why is it that "other people's wives are always better"? If his wife is also thinking, "other people's husbands are always better"! What should we do? Let us use a fair perspective to criticize: If a wife has children, because she is a housewife and also holds the position of mother, she will inevitably be a little more trivial. At this time, as a husband, he should be considerate. In addition, there are also husbands who like the new and are tired of the old. Because they are always with their wives every day, even if their wives are still as beautiful and passionate as before, they will also feel bored. So they begin to seek pleasure outside. How can a domestic flower be as fragrant as a wild flower? However, this kind of man will eventually reap the bitter fruit. Before long, the new acquaintance also feels bored, and true and eternal love abandons him because indulgence hurts his body, causing him to sink into the sea of ​​suffering from illness! A devoted woman for a heartless man. Women's love is always more focused than men's. Unless a woman does not marry him, once she marries him, she will be wholeheartedly devoted to him. To use physiological lust as an example: the virgin period is often very light, but after marriage, after the husband's teasing, it gradually continues to grow higher and higher. This is a natural physiological phenomenon. Therefore, for a husband who is energetic and satisfied by his wife, love after marriage will definitely progress with the times, reaching a state of joy and harmony, and happiness without end! But if a man has committed self-pollution and seminal emission in his early years, or early marriage with multiple wives, and indulges in lust, consuming too much of his reproductive gland fluid, then he will inevitably have depleted essence and blood, and a hundred diseases will arise. The most difficult to avoid are kidney weakness, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and scattered energy. Therefore, even if the wife is passionate, how can the husband bear to enjoy it? His body and mind are affected, resulting in the wife's lack of feeling and infertility, etc., which are too numerous to mention. Is this the wife's fault, or the husband's fault, for the wife's sexual indifference? According to Dr. Wamallesing, a famous German doctor, in several cases published in the German Medical Journal, he said: "The husband's premature ejaculation is cured, and the wife's hysteria is also suddenly cured." Because marital life is so beneficial to the body and mind, otherwise both parties will suffer unspeakably! Regarding the treatment methods for the above symptoms, according to Dr. Wang and my years of experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" is the most effective. Because this agent is a special agent for supplementing the reproductive glands. The quality is precious, the efficacy is certain, and there is probably no match in the world. It can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood, and nourish the nerves the next day and night after taking it. Continuing to take it for half a month can also help growth and adjust metabolism. The above symptoms can be completely cured. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himitotto's Semen-Stabilizing Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop the leakage, then the root cause and symptoms can be treated at the same time, and the effect is even faster.</p>
<h3>Seminal Emission and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Young people's semen is well hidden in the seminal vesicles with tightly closed sperm gates. Why is there seminal emission? According to the opinions of most doctors: it is believed that seminal emission must be caused by neurasthenia, which weakens the function of the sexual nerves that control the sperm gates, resulting in a relaxation phenomenon. Therefore, even when slightly stimulated by a dream or seeing a woman and causing the penis to erect, semen will involuntarily leak out. We only need to see that someone who has committed self-pollution and indulgence will inevitably develop seminal emission. This kind of activity is most likely to cause neurasthenia.</p>
<p>In physiological terms, semen is the reproductive gland fluid and is the source of our life. A man who never commits self-pollution and indulgence and cherishes his reproductive gland fluid will definitely be physically strong, think cleverly, and have abundant energy. This kind of young man will have unlimited prospects in academics and career and is a treasure of society and a promising talent for the nation and the country. At the same time, he is also sought after by women of the times. Once he marries a healthy and beautiful woman, he will surely have lively love, a sweet life, and raise sons and daughters, and there will be no end to happiness. However, a young man who does not know how to love himself, having committed self-pollution, indulgence, or early marriage and licentiousness, weakens his sexual nerves, resulting in seminal emission; and then allows the seminal emission to continue to be untreated, causing the symptoms to worsen, increasing the number of seminal emissions, or even developing the terrible spermatorrhea and sperm leakage, then because too much reproductive gland fluid is lost, the sexual, brain, and spinal cord nerves, which have mutual connections, will become weaker and weaker. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy will entangle endlessly, which will trap you in a city of sorrow and a sea of ​​suffering. Not only will there be no hope for the future, but also the happiness of married life will be completely lost!</p>
<p>Regarding seminal emission methods, Chinese and foreign doctors admire "Himitotto's Semen-Stabilizing Tablets" as the most effective holy medicine for treating the symptoms. Because this medicine can strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, it can often achieve the magical effect of sleeping peacefully and stopping seminal emission that night. If the above symptoms are caused by seminal emission for too long or early marriage and indulgence, then the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproduction Hormone" must also be taken to nourish the brain and kidneys and nourish the nerves. Continuing to take it for half a month can also help growth and adjust new metabolism. The above symptoms can be completely cured. Regular consumption in all seasons can also prolong life and rejuvenate!</p>

<h3>Breast Atrophy and Frigidity - The Devils that Destroy Love!</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Losing a clear curve and a posture without sensuality. Therefore, they are never liked by men of the times, and their common destiny is already very tragic, and the love of couples is already very weak. However, because of the atrophy of her breasts, the reproductive gland and ovarian function is unhealthy, and she will inevitably suffer from frigidity. Think about it: this kind of woman, usually the husband is not very satisfied with her, if she is indifferent to it when the man's sexual desire is high, without any enthusiastic expression, or even tired of it and refuses it, then the image she gives to the man is of course even worse. Because it is even worse, love decreases day by day, and bad feelings deepen, and eventually she is regarded as waste, and even disdained, or another golden house is built to hide a beauty. Isn't this a very common thing? According to medical judgment. A woman, to avoid this kind of misfortune, the first important thing is to develop her breasts. If a woman's breasts can be high and elastic, then her ovarian function is healthy, her metabolism is strong, and her hips must also be plump and her curves are fully exposed. In terms of beauty, she already has a sensual and moving posture. Moreover, these women have strong sex appeal, and the love between couples is deep and intense, and their happiness is naturally infinite. However, women with atrophied breasts don't have to be discouraged. With the progress of modern medicine, there is already an ovarian endocrine preparation for women [Reproduction Hormone] that can be saved. This agent has been proven by famous doctors from all over the world and is considered to have a peaceful medicinal property and great efficacy. If you continue to take it, not only can the atrophied breasts become higher day by day, but also can adjust menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, promote pregnancy function, increase love between the sexes, strengthen the body and beautify the face. It is difficult to describe all the functions.</p>

<h3>Recovery from Gonorrheal Cystitis</h3>
<p>Gonorrheal cystitis is inflammation caused by gonorrhea invading the bladder from the posterior urethra. Patients are mostly caused by missed treatment, mistreatment, and self-ignorance. Nowadays, most city doctors have backward knowledge and still believe that gonorrhea is a local disease in the urethra. They desperately use local surgery to wash the urethra. On the one hand, because during acute gonorrhea, the urethral mucosa is inflamed and swollen, there may even be ulcers. At this time, they are still unaware of the harm and recklessly use the method of washing the urethra to seek the expulsion of gonococci, which is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire, because it allows gonococci to take the opportunity to attack internally and escape to the bladder. Cystitis that could have been avoided is now caused by the misuse of this treatment method. In addition, this disease can also be caused by the abuse of over-the-counter drugs, prolonged neglect, or drinking and sexual activity. Patients have frequent urination, abdominal distension, and turbid urine. If examined with a bladder reflector, inflammatory swelling can be seen on the bladder head or bladder wall. If the leucoorrhea is examined under a microscope, other bacteria, such as pyogenic cocci, can still be seen.</p>
<p>The most direct bactericidal method in the treatment is the bladder lavage method, but it must be performed by skilled surgeons to avoid harm. On the one hand, the German Filtrin intravenous electrotherapy is used, and the latest chemical method of special medicine is taken internally. Considering all aspects, there is no need to worry about the poor prognosis of cystitis, but during the treatment period, it is necessary to avoid reckless actions to avoid losing all previous efforts. It must be remembered. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sunday afternoons.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congress Adjourns: Most of the President's Proposals Pass, Neutrality Act Amendment is Shelved</h3>
<p>(Washington) The 76th Congress adjourned at 11:36 PM today (Greenwich time), and is scheduled to reconvene in January next year. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) This session of Congress adjourned last night. The intensity of the debate beforehand was unprecedented since President Roosevelt took office. The House of Representatives adjourned at 6:30 PM, and the Senate followed suit five minutes later. Regarding President Roosevelt's balanced budget bill, the Senate has stipulated that its funding is US$190 million, while the amount allocated by the House of Representatives is US$54 million. This session of Congress has lasted for seven months, and its most significant fact is to oppose President Roosevelt and greatly expand the amount of expenditure, the most important uses of which are 2 billion yuan for national defense, 1.77 billion yuan for relief, and 1.194 billion yuan for agricultural programs. Another major trend of this session of Congress is the formation of a strong group of Republicans and conservative Democrats, which rejected the President's loan bill and refused to amend the Neutrality Act. As for President Roosevelt's victory, it lies in the smooth passage of the stabilization fund and the extension of the right to devalue the currency. (Associated Press dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate and House of Representatives adjourned late today. Although many of the proposals submitted by President Roosevelt have been rejected, many have been passed. Among them, most of the expenses in the budget proposal submitted by the President have been approved, such as US$1,734,000,000 for national defense and US$1,756,000,000 for unemployment relief. Other bills, such as the extension of the validity of the Currency and Finance Full Power Act and the administrative agency reform bill, have also been passed. On the other hand, the bill proposed by Democratic Senator Hatch that federal government employees should not participate in political activities was passed after a long period of discussion, regardless of the President's intentions. The Senate decided to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment. All of this deserves general attention. (Havas dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Begins Exercises</h3>

<h3>Germany Opens a New Seaport in the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is building a new seaport in Stolpmünde in the Baltic Sea. After the port is completed, the journey from Berlin to Pillau Port in East Prussia can be shortened by eight hours. The trade and transportation that previously passed through the Swinemünde military port can be mostly rerouted to the new port. In the event of war, the losses of commerce can be reduced and the distraction of military operations can be avoided. Swinemünde Port is the third most important naval base in Germany. Germany's territory is obstructed by the Polish Corridor, and East Prussia is not connected to other parts of Germany. If you take the waterway from Swinemünde Port to Pillau Port, the distance is 390 kilometers. Previously, the journey from Berlin to Pillau Port took 21 hours. In the future, after the completion of Stolpmünde Port and the railway connecting the port to Berlin, the journey will be shortened and can be reached in only 13 hours.

<h3>Assassination Occurs During Mexican Election</h3>
<p>Mexico City: The election campaign in the capital of Mexico, which had just begun a few days ago, suddenly saw a political assassination this afternoon.  Representative Sira, leader of the opposition Constitutional Civil Front Party (a party inclined toward fascism and with anti-Semitic tendencies) and also a colonel, was leaving the party headquarters when a group of thugs lying in wait shot at him with pistols. He was hit in the stomach and his survival is unlikely. After the incident, Colonel Sira's guards also returned fire, killing two of the thugs. According to police investigations, the mastermind behind this case is General Cárdenas (not to be confused with the Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas). He has already been arrested. This man supports General Dávila, the garrison commander of the capital, as a candidate for president, while Colonel Sira supports General Almazán as a candidate.  Although both factions are against the current government, they are as incompatible as fire and water. This is said to be the reason for the assassination. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Disastrous Torrential Rains in North China; Japanese Troops Assault American, Reap What They Sow</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Peiping in the "North-China Daily News" of July 28 states:  Continuous heavy rains have inundated North China. Tungchow, east of Peiping, has been flooded for several days, and people can only travel by boat on the roads. The countryside west of Peiping is also submerged. Foreigners residing outside the racecourse area are trapped in small houses, and some have waded into the city. In some places, the water is waist-deep.  Most railway lines are impassable due to flooding. No trains have run south of Paoting on the Peiping-Hankow Railway for over two weeks, and recently even Paoting has been cut off.  The Peiping-Suiyuan Railway is interrupted in several places. The new railway through Kupeikou to Jehol is completely out of service. Temporary bridges built between here and Kupeikou have all been washed away.  The railway built by the Japanese, passing through the old Yellow River bed to connect the Peiping-Hankow Railway and Kaifeng, has been completely swept away by the water. Chinese people with thousands of years of experience with the Yellow River would never have made the mistake of building a railway across the old Yellow River channel. During the flooding, guerrilla forces have become active again, approaching quite close to the city. A night attack by guerrillas occurred outside Hsuanwu Gate, and thirty Chinese, including many police officers, along with their guns and uniforms, were taken away. The Tungchihmen police station was also attacked, and the guerrillas surrounded the station, seizing a large number of guns and ammunition, and also capturing police uniforms. They then infiltrated and ambushed Japanese sentry posts. When real police came to reinforce, they were also mistaken for guerrillas by the Japanese troops, who opened fire on them.  They were forced to abandon their weapons and only avoided being killed after lengthy explanations. A Japanese sentry post at a hot spring in the Western Hills was suddenly attacked by guerrillas from Mao Feng Mountain (transliteration), suffering heavy losses. The next morning, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the attackers retreated.  The currency continues to fall, causing the general standard of living to rise. Japanese residents are also affected, just like everyone else. Today, Japanese shops, taverns, and entertainment venues have very few Japanese customers. Although the Japanese have placed huge announcements in the Chinese newspapers they control and posted English and Chinese slogans such as "Down with England" on telegraph poles and trees in a widespread propaganda effort, the anti-British movement in Peiping has not shown any signs of flourishing. According to Chinese sources, the heads of various guilds recently held a secret meeting and issued a private warning to Lian Jiaqi (transliteration), the main instigator of the anti-British movement, stating that if he did not stop this movement, he would suffer personal harm.  Due to currency chaos and import restrictions, trade is already very depressed and cannot bear the burden of false political disturbances. The news of the United States' abrogation of its commercial treaty with Japan came at a time when Japanese residents here were being incited and were very resentful of the British. This suddenly disheartened them and made them quite apprehensive. According to precedent, the Japanese should launch an anti-American movement in response to this move by the United States, but the sword of embargo hangs over their heads, and even Japanese soldiers can only endure it. It can now be safely predicted that from now on, they will treat American residents with much more caution and humility. British residents criticize the British government for not considering similar steps some time ago, which is truly regrettable. Only a few days before the American ultimatum, there was an incident where Japanese soldiers violently assaulted two American citizens from a local Christian university.  The incident occurred when the two Americans stopped their car in front of a Japanese sentry post at a hot spring.  Because there was no sentry outside the post, one of the Americans entered the barracks with a Japanese military pass to have it verified.  Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers loaded their rifles with live ammunition, as if they were about to open fire. Another Japanese soldier slapped the American in the face several times, presumably because he had entered their barracks without permission.  A Chinese policeman who led the American inside was also beaten and abused.  Another American entered the barracks to help his friend and was also beaten and humiliated.  Even the Chinese driver sitting in the car was beaten. When the incident was reported to the Japanese embassy, the embassy routinely apologized. However, the Japanese military did not take the assault seriously.  A Japanese military spokesman also defended himself with the same old clichés, saying that it must have been "due to a misunderstanding" and that "an investigation would be conducted, and anyone found guilty would be punished." However, this event is truly unfortunate for the Japanese. According to American sources here, this assault case is the most serious of similar incidents. American newspapers have published it with large headlines, which ultimately led Washington to make a surprising and sudden move. It is said that when the U.S. government handed the note to the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Horinouchi, it clearly stated that there could be no more assaults on American citizens. According to those returning to Peiping from Peitaiho, trains from the three eastern provinces are full of wealthy Chinese seeking refuge. The three eastern provinces seem to be quite alarmed these days, fearing possible air raids by Soviet aircraft. Therefore, wealthy Chinese are seeking refuge in areas that they hope will be more beneficial to their health. It is said that Puyi has recently moved to Dalian.</p>

<h3>The Situation on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Becomes Tense: Chinese Troops Advance on Jiaxing; Japanese Forces Caught Off Guard Suffer Heavy Losses; Fighting Also Occurs in the Shanghai Suburbs of Zhenru and Longhua</h3>
<p>In recent days, the regular, elite Chinese troops along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have been very active. Since crossing the railway, they have advanced towards the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway line. A few days ago, they launched a trial attack on Jiaxing, catching the Japanese forces off guard and inflicting heavy losses. Yesterday, a person from Jiashan told our reporter that yesterday afternoon (the 5th), around 12:00 PM, the Japanese forces, seeking revenge, dispatched a heavy bomber, which flew to Xitang Town, Jiashan, and dropped two bombs on Xitang Hospital. One bomb landed on Wanfu Restaurant, killing and wounding forty to fifty civilians. Three bombs landed behind the church, one on Lion Bridge, one at the western end of the North Pond Bridge, and one on the Lu family stone workshop in Tawan, reportedly causing many deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Attack Jiaxing, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Japanese</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese forces along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have heightened their alert, suddenly becoming tense. It is reported that Chinese troops are now launching attacks on the Japanese forces between Hangzhou and Jiaxing with a large number of troops divided into several groups. It is rumored that Chinese troops launched a trial attack on Jiaxing a few days ago, catching the Japanese forces off guard and inflicting heavy losses. At the same time, Chinese troops have also been repeatedly sighted in the suburbs and within the city of Hangzhou, causing great panic among the Japanese forces.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line: Japanese Build Trenches</p>
<p>Recently, a gentleman came to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Jiaxing Road and claimed that the Japanese forces are rushing to build trenches along the railway line. All major transportation routes have barbed wire set up. The Japanese forces' state of panic is evident in their expressions. They are extremely strict in checking passengers. Anyone even slightly suspected must undergo several hours of interrogation and search before being allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Villagers Eagerly Await the Arrival of Chinese Troops</p>
<p>In recent days, it has been widely rumored in the occupied areas that Chinese troops will recover major cities in the Eastern Theater before September 18th. The number of Japanese troops in the Jiaxing-Hangzhou area has indeed decreased compared to before. According to local farmers, it is currently the busy season for harvesting, and the new grain is about to be brought in. Farmers are often forcibly conscripted by the Japanese forces to serve as porters. At this time when agricultural work is becoming more urgent by the day, farmers eagerly await the arrival of Chinese troops to relieve their suffering.</p>
<p>Yang Guocai Sacrifices His Life for the Nation</p>
<p>Yang Guocai (also known as Yang Mao), under the command of Gu Fusheng of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps stationed north of Qinghu Highway near Dujia Lane in western Shanghai, recently advanced eastward and moved to the Shenxiang and Shenjiatang areas, two kilometers northwest of Qibao Town. On the first day of this month, they held a military conference in Qibao Town at noon to discuss strategies for ambushing the Japanese forces stationed on Hongqiao Road. Unexpectedly, a Japanese spy discovered this and reported it to the Japanese army headquarters. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese forces secretly mobilized the garrison troops stationed at Hongqiao Airport that evening, carrying weapons such as machine guns and small cannons, and secretly rushed to Shenxiang overnight, surrounding Yang Guocai's troops from all directions. At dawn on the second day, they launched a fierce attack. Yang's troops were caught off guard while still asleep and scattered in all directions. When Yang Guocai heard the noise and rushed out, he was already surrounded. He had no choice but to fight back while retreating. Unfortunately, during the fierce battle, he was suddenly ambushed by Japanese forces hiding in a corner, who threw three hand grenades, destroying Yang's left hand and severely wounding his leg. He was covered in blood and sacrificed his life for the nation. In addition to Yang's heroic sacrifice, over thirty of his subordinates were killed or wounded. Furthermore, over twenty innocent villagers were killed by Japanese machine gun fire. Their bodies were abandoned along the road. When this reporter passed through Qibao on the third day, he saw a large number of villagers, filled with resentment and anger, purchasing coffins in the town to collect the bodies of those who had died unjustly.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Zhenru and Longhua Yesterday</p>
<p>News from western Shanghai states that yesterday morning (the 6th) at dawn, dense gunfire was heard from Longhua Town in the Shanghai suburbs. Around 6:00 AM, the sound of planes roaring was heard in the sky, followed by two sudden explosions. According to general speculation, this was undoubtedly a fierce battle between Japanese and Chinese troops in the area. Furthermore, at 8:00 AM, a Japanese seaplane circled over Longhua for a long time, then flew over the concession and towards Zhabei along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. It is reported that regular Chinese troops are currently very active between the Zhenru and Longhua railways.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Attempts to Raise Prices; Authorities in Both Concessions Firmly Maintain Price Controls; Determined to Suppress Manipulation and Maintain Security Within the Concessions</h3>
<p>The period between harvests, when the supply and demand of rice are unbalanced, is an annual occurrence. Although the amount of rice stored in Shanghai's warehouses is not large, the authorities' investigation and announcement include the stock in rice shops, as well as the amount secretly stored elsewhere by rice merchants. Furthermore, the amount of flour in storage is sufficient for sixteen months, so there is absolutely no need to worry about the people's food supply. However, rice merchants see the current situation as an excellent opportunity for speculation and monopoly, and they refuse to let go, preferring to stop trading rather than compromise on the price controls. It is rumored that there are currently 100,000 piculs of rice stored in Pudong and along the Pu River. Although transporting it to Shanghai involves complicated procedures, there is still a small profit to be made. However, rice merchants are unwilling to purchase it. Flour merchants are also taking advantage of this opportunity to raise the price of flour along with the price of rice. If this continues, the authorities will inevitably have to take control of the sales.</p>
<p>Refusing to Deal Under the Table: Rice Market Stalls</p>
<p>In the past week, the chaotic situation in the rice market has reached a boiling point. A small number of rice merchants are only interested in profiting, ignoring the authorities' price controls and the guild's advice, leading to rampant trading under the table. The Rice Dealers' Guild believes that the rice shops are in a difficult situation, so they have stopped buying goods subject to price controls since the 5th. Hundreds of rice shops have jointly signed to comply, and the rice market has stalled.</p>
<p>Rice Shops' Attitude Turns Passive</p>
<p>The Rice Dealers' Guild's announcement advising members to comply with price controls has been published in the newspaper twice due to the rampant trading under the table. Their painstaking efforts to care for the people's food supply have long been appreciated by the citizens. However, in recent days, rice shops, except for old customers who can obtain high-quality rice for around twenty-two yuan, offer second-grade rice to new customers for twenty yuan. If one wants to buy good rice, they reply that the stock is sold out and there is no way to buy it. Their unified response makes it difficult to argue. Their passive attitude is evident.</p>
<p>Manipulating the Rice Market: Attempting to Lift Price Controls</p>
<p>Reporters from the Xin Xin News Agency have investigated various tactics used in the rice market, such as (1) storing rice in various locations to avoid investigation, (2) rice dealers refusing to show samples to deliberately disturb people's minds, and (3) rice shops using the excuse that there is no rice to import and deciding to sell out their remaining stock and then stop selling. Under this coordinated manipulation of transportation and sales, how can rice prices not rise, and how can trading under the table be eradicated? The facts prove that the goal is to attempt to lift the price controls. This kind of phenomenon occurring during this extraordinary period is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Remain Calm</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession originally set price controls on rice to maintain the food supply for millions of people in Shanghai and to protect social stability. Furthermore, when setting the price controls, they invited representatives from various rice industry groups to discuss and decide. The set price controls take into account both maintaining the people's food supply and the interests of the rice merchants. Therefore, they will continue to implement the price controls as usual. If there is any trading above the price controls, citizens can immediately report it.</p>
<p>Rice Dealers Discuss the Root of the Rice Market Problem</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have risen, and there have been instances of trading under the table in the market that exceeds the price controls. The Rice Dealers' Guild believes that rice shops are generally in a difficult situation and have exhausted their responsibility to advise. However, whether or not there is coordinated manipulation of transportation and sales concerns the food supply of all citizens. It is hoped that people in the industry will rely on their conscience to create benefits for the public. Yesterday, a senior official of the Rice Dealers' Guild stated, "The rise and fall of rice market prices are determined by rice merchants at any time. Rice shops must listen to the broker's offer when buying rice on the market. Therefore, the brokers control the prices. If brokers can comply with price controls when showing samples and offering prices, rice shops will definitely not buy at high prices, causing difficulties in sales. Currently, shops are complying with price controls, and this guild has also repeatedly announced to all rice shops to strictly comply. From this, it can be seen that rice shops can indeed comply with price controls. This is proven by the facts. As for the higher prices under the table in the market, the root cause lies entirely with the selling brokers. Because member rice shops comply with price controls, there is nowhere to buy goods in the market. If they buy under the table and sell according to price controls, they will not only sacrifice their capital but also violate the law. Therefore, they have jointly and voluntarily signed to comply with price controls and not buy rice under the table as a passive response, while also reducing their own suffering. It is also rumored that a certain large rice factory on Mei Bai Ge Road has warehouses. The guild has also sent personnel to investigate and found that there was a misunderstanding. The market has rice milling on behalf of customers, and there are no goods in stock that exceed the price controls. In short, rice shops focus on retail. Since there is a standard for price controls, how can they sell goods purchased at high prices? This guild is currently conducting a close investigation. If there are any violations, they will be reported," and so on.</p>
<h3>Government's Determination to Stabilize the Currency System Remains Unchanged; Unscrupulous Merchants Seek Profit by Deliberately Spreading Rumors; Proving Them False Will Restore Public Confidence</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumor that the Chinese government has commissioned British companies to print 10 billion new banknotes, Shanghai banks have not heard of it, so it cannot be verified. However, the Chinese government is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender and will not change it. The rumor that there will be inflation is absolutely false. If the value of the legal tender is not maintained, the people's faith in the government will be lost, and the losses will far outweigh the gains. It should be known that if the credibility of the legal tender cannot be maintained, how can the people believe that the war of resistance will be won and the nation will be built? The current strength of the war of resistance relies on the credibility of the legal tender. Today, the government consistently maintains the statutory foreign exchange rate and continues to provide as much as possible for legitimate needs. The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China issue legal tender, which is inspected monthly by the Issuance Reserve Committee and announced monthly to demonstrate their integrity. The latest inspection report shows that although the issuance has increased, the cash reserve is still above 44%, which is higher than most countries' cash reserves. The above facts prove that China has not experienced inflation. Therefore, it is predicted that the financial market will stabilize starting today (Monday), proving the rumors to be false. However, the unscrupulous merchants' deliberate spreading of rumors is aimed at profiting, which is very disappointing.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship Haig Sails the Nanyang Route; Scheduled to Weigh Anchor Tomorrow Morning; Primarily for Loading Cargo</h3>
<p>To maintain their shipping industry in China, foreign shipping companies, in addition to increasing ships sailing the Shanghai-Hong Kong route and the Hong Kong defense line, have also opened new Nanyang routes. Today, the British merchant ship Haig is scheduled to depart from Shanghai tomorrow morning for Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Yangon, etc., primarily for loading cargo. As for the Zhoushan Islands (i.e., Dinghai) in eastern Zhejiang, since their fall, some have contacted the Japanese to obtain travel permits and chartered ships to sail the Shanghai-Dinghai route, as well as Shenjiamen and Daishan. In addition, there is also the Xiamen route, which is under Japanese control and also barely operates.</p>
<h3>New Philippine Steamer to Sail to Shanghai; Named After Mrs. Quezon's Maiden Name</h3>
<p>One of the three sister ships produced by the American Manila Teheran-Maru Shipping Company, the "Dona Aurora Quezon" light steamer, will leave the Italian shipyard there next month and arrive on the Chinese seas. The ship's name is the maiden name of the current Philippine President Quezon's wife. It has a deadweight of 9,500 tons. Future plans include scheduled voyages between New York, Manila, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The maiden voyage is scheduled to go to New York via Karachi. The steamer has twelve passenger cabins and a cruising speed of fifteen nautical miles per hour.</p>
<p>Departing from Manila to Sail to America</p>
<p>The entire journey can be completed in forty days, and a short stay is planned in Los Angeles. The Teheran-Maru Shipping Company has a historical shipbuilding company. The other two sister steamers will leave the Italian shipyard after the "Dona Aurora Quezon" in the coming year, either in February or March or no later than May. It is generally hoped that when the steamer returns to Manila from New York, President Quezon will be asked to perform the naming ceremony.</p>
<h3>Unified Class A Public Bonds: Regular Lottery; Principal Repayment of 3.75 Million</h3>
<p>After the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China discounted and paid for the matured principal and interest of the customs-guaranteed debts, the seventh principal repayment and interest payment of the Unified Public Bonds began on July 31. As for the eighth principal repayment lottery, the National Debt Fund Management Committee has scheduled it separately. The Unified Class A Public Bonds are scheduled to hold the lottery at 10:00 AM on August 10, drawing twenty-five winners, with a principal repayment of 3.75 million yuan. The payment date is January 31 of next year.</p>
<h3>Polish Envoy Weidenthal's Health Improves</h3>
<p>Polish Envoy Weidenthal suddenly fell ill a few days ago. After being treated at the Hong'en Hospital, he has not yet fully recovered. It is reported that Weidenthal suffered from acute appendicitis. His condition is currently very good and he is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a few days.</p>
<h3>Attaché of the French Embassy, Briot, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 6th that Attaché Briot of the French Embassy in China, accompanied by his wife, has returned from a trip to Indochina and has now arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Non-Essential Goods Banned from Import: Trade Deficit Expected to Decrease Gradually; Goods Already Imported and Taxed Allowed to Be Re-Exported; Import Ports Limited to Central Government Control</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced the measures to ban the import of goods, it has issued orders to customs offices in various locations for implementation, aimed at reducing the trade deficit and stabilizing finance. Goods that have already been imported and taxed, with the import ports under the central government's control at the time of tax payment, are allowed to be re-exported. The details of the import of essential goods and the supply of statutory foreign exchange are described below:</p>
<p>Order Issued for Implementation: Imports Banned</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued orders to customs offices in various locations, stating that to reduce the trade deficit and stabilize finance, it has specially formulated measures to ban the import of goods during extraordinary times and has published a table listing the tariff codes and goods. The implementation will begin immediately. These banned import goods are not allowed to be declared for re-export after the ban is issued. All imported or re-exported postal packages are also subject to the provisions of these measures. However, in special circumstances, the ministry may issue special purchase and transport licenses, allowing a certain amount to be imported. Regarding the re-export of these banned import goods, if a reliable certificate can be provided proving that the import tax payable was paid at the import port before the ban was implemented, and the import port was under central government control at the time of tax payment, re-export may also be allowed. You are hereby ordered to comply and implement accordingly. (The table is printed in the newspaper and is omitted here.)</p>
<p>Essential Goods: Supply of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>All goods that are not banned from import and are necessary for the country are still allowed to be imported or re-exported, and they may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase statutory foreign exchange according to the rules for applying for the purchase of foreign exchange for imported goods, designating the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China to handle it. However, they must pay the balance fee for the difference between the statutory foreign exchange rate and the listed price of the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China. Regarding the export of local goods, the foreign exchange received should be sold to the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China, and they are allowed to receive the difference between the statutory foreign exchange rate and the listed price of the Central Bank of China and the Communications Bank of China. Therefore, the export of local goods will inevitably gradually increase, and the import of foreign goods, except for essential goods, will be strictly restricted. China's overall trade deficit is expected to decrease, and international trade will improve, allowing income and expenditure to be balanced.</p>

<h3>Australia Considers British Intentions: May Abolish Trade with Japan; Sino-Australian Trade Has Greatly Improved; Far East War Generally Sympathetic to China</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the development of Far East trade in recent years has made the Australian Commonwealth extremely concerned about Pacific affairs and is in a position to agree that the British government may require the Commonwealth to abolish any subordinate trade with Japan, which is far superior to what it was before. Japan's purchases of goods from Australia (mainly wool) have fallen from nearly £18 million to around £6 million. Due to the surge in trade last year, Australia's imports from China (mostly wheat flour and wool) will be almost equal to Japan's annual purchases.</p>
<p>Australia's Exports to China Suddenly Increase</p>
<p>The reporter yesterday (5th) asked Mr. Bowden, the Australian government's commercial commissioner in China, about the Australian government's reaction to a possible British-Japanese trade break. He replied that Australia's exports to China have suddenly increased within a year, placing China and Japan on an equal footing in terms of purchasing Australian goods. According to the figures provided by Mr. Bowden, Japan has retreated to the status of the largest non-Australian customer, while Australia's trade with China has almost risen to pre-war levels. In terms of customs gold units, Australia's exports to China from January to June last year were 3,702,734, and the figure for the same period this year has reached 16,397,591.</p>
<p>Australian-Japanese Trade Suffers a Blow</p>
<p>In the year ending July 1936, Japan purchased goods worth £17,661,232 from Australia and exported £4,969,571 to Australia. In mid-1936, the Australian Federation implemented a licensing system aimed at promoting Australian production and assisting British products such as cotton, causing Australian-Japanese trade to suffer a blow. Japan immediately retaliated in the Australian wool market. In 1936, Japan ranked second in purchasing the most Australian wool, purchasing £14 million worth. By July 1937, Japan's imports from Australia had fallen from £17,661,232 to £9,705,738, and last year it fell again to £5,900,098, which is not much different from Australia's purchases from Japan of £5,349,086. Mr. Bowden talked about the increase in Sino-Australian trade, saying that it has greatly prospered. In one year of trade, wool imports have increased from 82,710 customs gold units to 605,800.</p>
<p>Australia's Position is the Same as Britain's</p>
<p>Yesterday, another important Australian told reporters that there is no doubt about what Australia will do if Chamberlain takes real action in the Far East. At that time, even if we sacrifice our wool trade with Japan, we will hear Australia's sincere opinions. Australia's response to the motherland's call last September has shown which side it sympathizes with in the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Japanese Loading of Scrap Iron Repeatedly Prevented</p>
<p>It should be remembered here that the Labor opposition party in the Australian government completely opposes Japan and its current international policies. If the Labor opposition party has a say in Australian policy, Australian-Japanese trade relations will be immediately severed. If the federal government had not used strong legal weapons to intervene, Japanese ships would often have been prevented from loading scrap iron. The frequency with which this happened is enough to give a full glimpse into what workers think of the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<p>Japanese Experiment in Sheep Herding Clearly Fails</p>
<p>According to another Australian, no matter what happens in the future, Japan will only stop buying Australian wool if it lacks foreign exchange. The Japanese have tried to raise spiral-horned sheep in Manchuria, but failed because the climate there is humid and they have to put rubber covers on the sheep's feet to prevent them from getting sick. Some say that the Japanese will raise sheep all over Manchuria to compete with Australian wool in the market. In his personal opinion, if the Japanese transport more sheep there now, they will provide more delicious lamb meals to the guerrillas.</p>
<p>China Buys 500,000 Military Blankets</p>
<p>One day, it will be Australia's largest customer for wool and sheep. Every winter, the number of people using wool for official purposes is increasing. This year, the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives have ordered 500,000 military wool blankets. China's wool cannot meet domestic demand and must raise sheep soon, first operated by a government department and then extended to farmers in the mountainous areas of the southwest. Agricultural experts who have been working in western China for several years have recently been able to move into the animal husbandry institutes of various universities in the interior, and the government's concentrated promotion of scientific farming is very strong. Chinese farmers raising livestock are definitely not fools.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Grand Event at the Metropolitan: Dozens of Dance Troupes Perform for Three Days</h3>
<p>The Metropolitan Garden Ballroom at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road in this city is scheduled to hold a three-day anniversary celebration and entertainment convention from the 9th to the 11th of this month. Preparations began more than a month ago. To promote Chinese art, dozens of local art and dance troupes have been rigorously selected. During these three days, the performances will run continuously from 4:00 PM until closing time. On the 10th at 11:00 PM, there will be a standard dance championship awards ceremony. The famous Kunqu opera performer, Ms. Wang Xichun, has been invited to present the awards. On this day, major Chinese and foreign manufacturers will be giving away excellent products at the hall. The hall has been busy decorating and preparing everything in recent days. It will be an unprecedented grand event in Shanghai. It is expected that it will cause a sensation at the time. It is also said that a special fourth-anniversary publication will be published. The content is very exciting and will be distributed to the guests on this day.</p>
<h3>Each Gap in North Jiangxi Road: Rumor Has It Will Be Blocked Periodically; That Section Does Not Connect to Hongkou; Rumors of Opening Three Places on Haining Road are Untrue</h3>
<p>The area of shops, residences and alleys of North Jiangxi Road, which starts from the north side of the tap water bridge in the south, and ends at the east side of Old Bazai Road in the north, have been blocked by the Japanese with wooden poles and barbed wire since the 29th of last month, and have not yet been removed. Yesterday morning, it was claimed that there were</p>
<p>Japanese Soldier Sentry Posts</p>
<p>at the blocked gap on Haining Road. There are no Japanese sentries stationed at the Wenjianshi Road gap, but the Japanese have set up cloth sheds in the blocked area at the east end of the road to issue permits that are only valid for two months to residents living in the area. Residents living in the area speculate that the</p>
<p>Blocked Gap</p>
<p>that is currently retained will eventually be blocked on the 10th of this month. However, the gap in Haining Road is still expected to be opened at that time. However, at that time, entry and exit will be based on permits. Although entry into the newly blocked area is still free now, it is only from the east side of North Sichuan Road to the west side of North Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>New Blocked Area</p>
<p>Near North Sichuan Road, there are other obstacles. Therefore, residents of Hongkou still have to use Sichuan Road Bridge and Chongming Road to enter and exit. It is a misunderstanding that the Japanese have opened three places, including Haining Road, to facilitate the entry and exit of residents living in the Hongkou area. Also, the Old Bazai Road gap is not open.</p>
<h3>Cereal Exchange: Access More Restricted Than Before; The Police Are Aiming to Maintain Order in the Vicinity; However, Family Members of the Members are Extremely Panicked and Request Flexibility</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession's Mailan police station implemented emergency security measures at the Cereals and Oilseed Exchange at 15 Edward Road in this city, they have dispatched detectives to guard the exchange and have regulated the opening and closing times of the exchange's iron gate. The gate is opened at 8:00 AM, locked again at 11:00 AM at noon, reopened at 1:30 PM, and locked at 7:00 PM, cutting off passage. The detectives take the key. Entry and exit are based on the exchange certificate. If they do not have the exchange certificate, they will be rejected. This has caused more than 100 members and their families living in the exchange to be unable to move freely. The back door of the exchange has also been blocked for a long time, and only one large door is used to enter and exit. Now that it is blocked, if there is a fire or a sudden illness, they will inevitably sit and wait for death. Moreover, children's access to school, purchasing food, and emptying chamber pots are all hindered, causing great difficulties. They have jointly written to the French Concession Police Department and the Chinese Ratepayers Association, stating the reasons and requesting a change in the opening and closing times of the exchange gate, from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM, without locking it at noon, in order to facilitate entry and exit. The French Concession Police Department has not yet responded to the letter. The police are enforcing stricter restrictions on entry and exit than before. According to a gentleman from the exchange who spoke to the Daguang News Agency reporter yesterday, the police have announced that starting today, women and children will not be allowed to enter or exit. Therefore, more than 100 members and their families are quite panicked and are preparing to petition relevant public organizations today, requesting them to request flexibility on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Haikou Blockade Disrupts Transportation, Dyeing and Weaving Industry Suffers Stagnation, Over Two Hundred Businesses Concentrated in Western Shanghai Are Exerting Efforts to Dredge Sales Channels</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the general hub of the international commercial arena. Commerce is prosperous. In recent years, the population of Shanghai has increased dramatically, and the demand for daily necessities has expanded. Leaders in the dyeing and weaving industry, in order to adapt to the times, have raised funds to establish factories, and the number of factories starting operations and shipping goods has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. At that time, transportation was smooth and raw materials were cheap, and profits were quite high for a time. Expansion was rapid, and in order to protect the rights and interests of the industry, the Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association was established.</p>
<p>Concentrated in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the factory areas of Hongkou, Yangshupu, Zhabei, Pudong, and Nanshi were designated as war zones. In addition to temporarily dismissing all workers and ceasing operations, the factories did not have time to move out all their machinery and assets. By the time the national army moved west and the city recovered, the machinery and assets had been destroyed. Therefore, the losses of the dyeing and weaving factories were enormous. Subsequently, because refugees from the suburbs and other places flocked to Shanghai, the population of Shanghai increased dramatically, and the cloth business flourished. Thereupon, the factories independently found ways to build factories and start operations in safe areas within the concession, such as the French Concession in western Shanghai, to meet market demand. Business was still decent, and although the price of raw materials trended upwards, profits were still high. According to a report from the industry association, as of now, there are still 190 national product dyeing and weaving factories that have joined the association, and more than 20 that have not joined, mostly concentrated in the western Shanghai area, with capital ranging from a maximum of two million yuan to a minimum of four or five thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Stagnation of Sales Channels</p>
<p>Because the war zone is expanding daily, the seaports in various places are being blockaded, transportation is obstructed, and shipping is suspended, resulting in stagnation of sales to out-of-town customers. Currently, except for Kunming and other places where large quantities are still being shipped, other places have been cut off. In addition, raw materials are blocked from being transported to Shanghai, and selling prices are trending upwards. The business of large and small dyeing and weaving factories has sharply declined, shortening working hours and reducing production. However, the leaders of the industry's factories have repeatedly tried to dredge up sales to out-of-town customers in an attempt to save the precarious situation. However, the sales channels of the local stores are unaffected, remaining the same as in the past. The products of national product dyeing and weaving factories are mostly twill fabrics, coarse and fine plain fabrics, "baoji," satin, and various cotton fabrics by the bolt, indanthrene cloth details, raw-color twill, standard color cloth, modern blue cloth, etc. The buyers of these types of cloth are mostly ordinary people, so those who buy whole bolts are quite few.</p>
<h3>Salt Reclamation Expert Jiang Zhiyuan Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Jiang Zhiyuan of Wuyuan was a pioneer in the salt reclamation industry. He assisted Mr. Zhang Jian'an of Nantong in establishing the reclamation and animal husbandry company, reclaiming wasteland and developing it, with remarkable results. Recently, due to weakening health, he passed away in Shanghai on July 4th. Colleagues from various industrial companies in Nantong and various salt reclamation companies in Huainan, believing that Jiang's contributions benefited the people's livelihood, specially initiated a memorial service, scheduled for the morning of August 7th (Monday) at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road.</p>

<h3>Fire on Carter Road Kills Eight People, Big and Small; Film Catches Fire on First Floor, Uncontrollable, Burns Through Staircase, Tenants Upstairs Perish</h3>
<p>Number 6, Renchang Lane, 214 Carter Road, Songshan Road, in the French Concession, is a three-story building with two side rooms. The second landlord, Zhang Bingsheng, a native of Huzhou, 40 years old, lived on the entire first floor and also ran the "Happy Forest Film Company" inside, with many old films piled up in the house, and had fire insurance. The upstairs living room was rented to the family of Zhang Baotang (号 Xunnan), a native of Fengxian who practiced law in Shanghai. The east side room was rented to a family surnamed Li, and the west side room was rented to Zhang Chuqing, a native of Ningbo (associate manager at the Ruifeng Lumber Company in Nanshi), and his son Zhang Wenbin. At a quarter past four in the afternoon the day before yesterday, the films piled up in the "Happy Forest Film Company" of the second landlord on the first floor suddenly caught fire. Because the weather has been dry recently, and the films were all made of rosin, the fire broke out at a touch and was uncontrollable, instantly bursting through the floorboards and out the roof. At that time, only the second landlord's entire family and the tenant surnamed Li in the east side room upstairs escaped. Zhang Wangshi (46 years old, native of Ningbo), wife of Zhang Chuqing in the west side room upstairs, and her daughter Xiu'e (12 years old), Xiao Mao (5 years old), and nephew Wang Zhongfu (6 years old), a family of four, and Zhang Zhu Surong (28 years old, native of Wuxi), wife of Zhang Baotang in the living room upstairs, her daughter Xiao Gou (2 years old), and wet nurse Li Cuiying (22 years old, native of Jiangwan), and another maid (name unknown, over 40 years old, native of Ningbo), a total of eight people, all died in the fire because the staircase was burned through and they were blocked by the thick flames and could not escape. Only Zhang Wenbin's wife, daughter-in-law of Zhang Chuqing, was pregnant and nearly due, and fortunately discovered the fire early and was able to escape, but her hands and feet were injured. The fire had spread to the residence of the landlord at Number 7 next door. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire, and it was extinguished after an hour, destroying two houses. Later, eight bodies, large and small, were dug out, all charred, with incomplete limbs, a terrible sight. At 7:00 AM yesterday, the police station sent detectives to transport the bodies to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, and they will report to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for inspection. Meanwhile, the police station will summon Zhang Bingsheng, the fire starter, to investigate the cause of the fire and handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Rental of Carter Theatre; Dong Zhaobin Leads Crowd to Question, Russian Doormen Beaten</h3>
<p>The Carter Theatre on Carter Road was originally rented by Zhong Dingchen from the landlord. Later, Zhong subleased it to Dong Zhaobin for business, with a written lease agreement. It is now known that because the lease term has expired and Dong Zhaobin has not fully paid the rent, Zhong Dingchen locked the theatre and notified him to move out. Dong was unwilling to comply, and at 10:30 yesterday morning, he went with his friends to question Zhong. At that time, the crowd that gathered numbered nearly two or three hundred people. For a time, there were many people talking at once, and a few people entered the gate of the theatre. The two Russian doormen hired by the theatre were injured in the chaos, one with a head injury and one with a chest injury. Liang Heshang, the chauffeur of Zhong Dingchen, was also injured by the people sent by Dong, with two axe wounds on his arm and iron instrument injuries on his leg. The police station received the news and sent officers to the scene, and the people dispersed in all directions. The three injured people were sent to the police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbery Gang Trial Concludes, Twenty-Three Cases, Sentencing Scheduled for the Eleventh</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department successively arrested a large number of robbers, kidnappers, and murderers, including Chen Yuansheng, Jiang Liansheng, Zhang Shaole, Sun Yaowu, Gao Yunwen, and Xiang Chenshi, seventeen people in total, and suspects Ren Maotou, Chuan Lishi, Wang Zhoushi, etc., twelve people in total, at the Wu Gong, Daxin, Dongfang, and Da Zhonghua hotels at the beginning of last month. They also seized five pistols, more than fifty rounds of ammunition, and two hand grenades, and took them all to the police station for detention and investigation. During the investigation, the defendant Chen Wusheng and others originally confessed that from May 2nd of this year to the date of their arrest, they had continuously committed seven crimes in the Public Concession. Yang Shunkang and Ming Shanxiang confessed that on the 2nd of last month, they were ordered by Xu Wen'an, captain of the bodyguard team of a mansion at Number 6, Lane 95, Dingpan Road, to fire shots at the Chinese and Western police on that road. Jiang Liansheng confessed to organizing a gang with the intention of kidnapping the three-year-old son of Zhou Baoqing, but failed. The defendants also admitted to more than ten robbery cases. Recently, the police department further ascertained that the defendant Chen Wusheng and others had committed six crimes. Regarding the twelve suspects, including Ren Mao and Li Chuan, they have been reported to the First Special Court for approval to be released. After filing a public prosecution against the seventeen defendants, Chen Wusheng, Xiang Chenshi, male and female, for crimes such as robbery and attempted kidnapping, Judge Jiang held a special court trial yesterday and concluded the case. All the defendants were returned to custody, and the sentencing is scheduled for the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Foreman Contracted to Repair the "Izumo" Warship Was Intimidated for Money; Two People Arrested Confess to Borrowing Military Funds</h3>
<p>Tang Adong, who works as a foreman at a shipyard in Yangshupu, residing at Number 25, Huayuanfang, Jin Shenfu Road, was suddenly visited on the 12th of last month by Xie Ronggen (32 years old) and Wang Kechang (30 years old), both natives of Pudong who claimed to be members of the Pudong Guerrilla Force. They told Tang that they had been ordered by their superiors to come and borrow military funds, etc. Tang immediately reported to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Xie and Wang and escort them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The day before yesterday, Judge Liao held a court hearing for interrogation.顧守熙 Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, filed a lawsuit on charges of intimidation and fraud, and stated that the plaintiff had previously received five or six threatening letters, all using the name of the guerrilla force, in an attempt to extort money. This defendant directly went to the plaintiff's home to extort money. He requested that the case be handled according to the law. When questioned, the two defendants, Xie and Wang, confessed that after the August 13th Incident, after the Japanese "Izumo" warship was damaged by the national army, the plaintiff independently contracted to repair it and made a lot of profit. Therefore, their captain, Qian Changgen, sent a letter to the plaintiff to discuss borrowing military funds. They were informed by the people, went privately to the plaintiff's home to report, and planned to get rewards. They did not dare to intimidate. The rest of their words were evasive. The court reviewed the confession and decided to postpone the hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Jin Xingen Was Slashed in Front of the Da Zhonghua Hotel; Face Was Cut Three Times; Assailant Escaped</h3>
<p>Jin Xingen, a local man, 40 years old, living in Xujiahui in the French Concession, usually occupied an evil force. Around 2:00 PM yesterday, Jin Xingen, wearing a Western suit, was walking near the Da Zhonghua Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yu Qiaqing Road when he was suddenly attacked by three thugs who jumped out from the side of the road and slashed his face three times. Jin fell to the ground in pain. Seeing that they had achieved their goal, the assailants fled immediately. The nearby police officers at the intersection rushed over, but the assailants had already escaped. They quickly sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported back to the police station to pursue the assailants. It is learned that Jin Xingen has been very active in western Shanghai recently.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Decent Women Forced into Prostitution; Five Madams Arrested</h3>
<p>Yang Laoer, Zhang Zhangshi, and others, women from Ningbo, were arrested for opening a brothel at Number 9, Lane 158, Yunnan Road, and inducing and abducting decent women to force them into prostitution. The Lao Zha Police Department detected this and ordered Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them at the address. In addition to the two women, Yang and Zhang, the accomplices Chen Wei'an, Chen Shenshi, and Wang Fanshi were also arrested. The victims, Li Jinnü (also known as Li Zhenmei, 18 years old, native of Tongzhou), Wang Yuezhen (23 years old, native of Changshu), Dong Xiao (also known as Chen Zhenbao, 16 years old, native of Suzhou), Dong Sannü (also known as Chen Jinnü, 16 years old, native of Suzhou), Gu Zhendi (also known as Chen Judi, 16 years old, native of Yangzhou), Chen Yuezhen (17 years old, native of Jiangyin), and Shen Yueying (also known as Ye Hongyang, 16 years old, native of Suzhou), seven people in total, were rescued. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Special Court, Criminal Division One, and prosecuted for the crime of harming public morals under Article 231 of the Criminal Law. After a brief interrogation by the judge, they were ordered to return the defendants to custody and await further verification at a later date. The victims, Li Jinnü, and others, were temporarily adopted by the Jiliang Institute.</p>
<h3>German Expatriate Kills Mistress Out of Love; Charged with Murder</h3>
<p>Haimaina Lanya, a German expatriate, about 40 years old, killed his lover, 法桑 (transliteration), with a razor at Number 915, Avenue Joffre, last month after discovering that his lover had another lover. He attempted suicide but failed and was arrested by the French Concession Police Department. He was recently escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court and charged with murder. Judge Liao ascended the bench for interrogation. The defendant Haimaina Lanya confessed that because he discovered that 法桑 had another lover, he asked her to clearly state whether she would marry him in the future, but she did not give a specific answer. He bought suicide drugs and a razor, intending to commit suicide after killing her, but he later abandoned this plan and only wanted to warn her, or commit suicide himself, and had no intention of killing her. The court reviewed the confession and ordered the start of arguments.顧守熙, a lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that the Concession Administrative Authority prosecuted the defendant for murder, and the defendant's criminal behavior was very obvious, and the defendant did not die. The defendant was jealous because of adultery, and because of jealousy, he committed murder. According to the law, the defendant should be held responsible for the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law and requested the presiding judge to sentence him according to the law. The defendant's defense lawyer then stated his opinion, saying that the victim's behavior was vile, which several people could prove, and requested the court to postpone the hearing and summon witnesses for cross-examination in order to understand the truth of the case. The court then approved the suspension of arguments and postponed the hearing to the 19th of this month to await the summoning of witnesses for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Geng Yu Li and Along the Road</h3>
<p>The houses in Geng Yu Li and along the road on Rue Poupard in the French Concession are owned by Song Ziqing, a Catholic. Last month, the Dehe Foreign Firm, the real estate agent for the lane, suddenly sent letters to the tenants, stating that from August, the rent for single-family houses would be increased by five yuan, and the rent for double-family houses would be increased by ten yuan, and each household would be required to install its own water meter, and all water fees and water meter deposits would also be borne by the tenants, etc. After receiving the notice, the tenants in the lane unanimously believed that at this extraordinary time, when prices of all goods were soaring, it was unbearable to be subjected to further residential oppression. They jointly sent a letter to the foreign firm, stating the tenants' difficulties and firmly refusing to increase the rent. They convened a general meeting, elected representatives, and sent letters to the Police Department of the French Municipal Council and the French Water and Electricity Company, etc., appealing for help. Meanwhile, they hired three lawyers, Li Ming, Zhang Yiping, and Xu Yin, to proceed according to the law. It is now learned that the rent for all households in the lane has been deposited in the Bank of China uniformly, and they will not stop until the goal of stopping the rent increase and abolishing the installation of water meters is achieved.</p>
<h3>Dutch Consulate Holds Banquet to Celebrate the Birth of the Princess's Daughter; Today at Noon at the Union Club on Xiejiao Road to Celebrate the Health of the Princess and Her Daughter</h3>
<p>Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to a daughter on the morning of the 5th at Soestdijk Palace, which greatly disappointed the Dutch people, who had hoped for a male heir for a century. The child was born at 1:09 PM, a very strong infant, weighing eight and a half pounds. The mother and daughter are now both healthy. The Dutch Consul in this city, 鲍赛汶 Bao Saiwen, decided to hold a banquet at the Union Club on Xiejiao Road, Jing'an Temple Road, at 12:00 noon today to celebrate the birth of the daughter and the health of the princess and her daughter.</p>
<h3>Muslims Commemorate Su Zixiang This Morning at Chunhua Restaurant</h3>
<p>No less than 100,000 Muslims reside in this city, and most of them are poor. Their children mostly drop out of school. Recently, 陳經會 Chen Jinghui, 楊叔平 Yang Shuping, and others have initiated a scholarship fund for the poor, and have already raised a certain amount. Su Zixiang, one of the initiators, also generously donated 500 yuan. Unfortunately, he passed away recently. Because Mr. Su was enthusiastic about education, fellow Muslims decided to hold a memorial service at Chunhua Restaurant on Daxin Street at 10:00 AM today to commemorate him. They also asked Mr. Su's relatives and friends to convert all gifts into cash to supplement the fund so as to benefit the poor. The Isolated Battalion, from June 25th to July, received慰勞 condolence cash and goods, etc., a total of 20 cases. Cash慰勞 condolences included the Guangyu Association, which慰贈 presented a total of 124 yuan, and the Chinese police officers of the Putuo Road Police Department, who慰贈 presented 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Zhang Yingjie raised 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Do Not Waste Extravagantly</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the National Government recently consulted the provincial governments of various provinces, saying that the Executive Committee of Meishan County, Sichuan Province, suggested that the price of paper has recently risen in various places, increasing daily, which has become a panic phenomenon. The reason for this is that the demand is vast and supply is insufficient, and also because of the lack of raw materials, which are difficult to supply. Even if everyone saves and specializes in cultural undertakings, it may not be enough to allocate. It has been found that people in various places are accustomed to old habits, and every year at the end of the year, New Year's, Qingming, and Qiban, they all use paper as a necessary item to commemorate their ancestors. Various religious associations and chanting sutras and reciting Buddha names also consider it an indispensable ritual to worship gods, using useful paper for useless consumption. If this continues, without thinking of ways to remedy the situation, the impact on the future of the War of Resistance will be far from insignificant. On the days of the end of the year, New Year's, Qingming, Qiban, and family anniversaries, the parents will convene a family meeting to commemorate (or name it the "Chasing Remembrance Festival"). After respectfully reading the party member's code of conduct, they will continue to explain that the ancestors' entrepreneurship was difficult and the descendants' preservation is not easy, imbuing the remembrance of ancestors with the intention of alerting future generations, neither wasting money nor consuming paper, and also making up for the paper shortage in various places, which is specially requested to be corrected. In addition, the raw materials for papermaking in various places are mostly taken from bamboo villages, and ordinary ignorant people, or greedy for temporary food, trying to gain small immediate benefits, often arbitrarily cut down new bamboo shoots. In the future, new bamboo shoots should also be advised not to be cut down indiscriminately.</p>
<h3>Leather Goods Workers Demand Wage Increase</h3>
<p>Workers in the leather goods industry in this city, because the prices of everything in Shanghai have recently soared and the cost of living has risen, find it difficult to maintain a living with their original wages. Therefore, various industries have successively increased wages, but the employers in this industry have not yet expressed any intention. The industry association recently issued a public notice to raise prices by 30%. For this reason, they specially elected representatives Zhu Bingcai, Wu Yajun, Jiang Shanliang, and others to petition the association, requesting a 30% wage increase to maintain their livelihoods. The association promised to seek the opinions of its members before replying and advised the workers to wait patiently for a legal resolution.</p>

<p>Traffic and Transportation</p>
<h3>Procedures for Studying in the United States (Continued)</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>After Arriving in the United States</p>
<p>Taking a train from San Francisco or Seattle to the eastern United States, a coach seat is more economical, but there is no sleeper berth at night, and passengers sitting in coach seats must pay extra freight if their luggage exceeds 150 pounds. The calculation of freight is also very expensive. If there is too much luggage, it does not seem worth it. However, passengers traveling in tourist class can transport 350 pounds without extra charge (when buying a ticket and checking luggage, you must specify "Transpacific"). Coach seats are fine for short trips, but it takes two days and three nights from the west coast to Chicago. Without a sleeper berth, it is not very comfortable. There are no tourist sleeper cars east of Chicago. Ordinary sleeper cars are 50% more expensive than coach seats, and a sleeper berth fee must be added. However, this section is not a long distance, at most one day and night, and sitting in a coach seat will not feel too hard.</p>
<p>The things needed on the train are just changes of clothes, pajamas, and daily necessities. There is no need to bring a lot of luggage. Now, most new cars have air and temperature control, so it is not too cold or too hot. Heavy luggage can be delivered directly to the final destination by the railway company. It does not matter if you stop for a few days on the way. At most, there will be a slight baggage storage fee (usually, if it exceeds 24 hours, it is 15 cents a day for each large item). Shipping luggage is not very troublesome. You can deliver it to a transfer company at the wharf and have it sent to the train station. If the train is not scheduled, you can also hand it over to the transfer company for temporary storage, keep the receipt yourself, and call the transfer company to deliver the luggage to the station after you have purchased the ticket. Exchange it for a train baggage ticket when you arrive at the station. If the procedures are not very clear, you can ask the person in charge of the railway company or entrust him to handle it on your behalf. After arriving at the destination and finding a place to live, you can hand over the baggage ticket to the local transfer company (usually near the station) to deliver it to your residence. The transfer fee is priced based on the size of the city, usually from 25 cents to one dollar for a large item.</p>
<p>To eat on the train, you can go to the dining car. The prices vary by railway. It is cheaper to eat Platelunch, usually 30 to 50 cents. For à la carte dishes, you can choose one or two items from the dishes listed on the menu. Do not eat like you did on the ship, not only is the price too high, but it is not the way Americans usually eat. The waiter's tip in the dining car is 10% of the meal cost. Sometimes the food in the dining car is too expensive. Someone sells food on the car at each meal, which you can buy. The price is cheaper. Sandwiches, toast, milk, and coffee are the most common foods. Sometimes the train stops at a larger station, and you can get off the train to eat, but because of time constraints, you can only use sandwiches, etc. Of course, you can also eat ordinary meals when the train stops for a long time. Although you can also buy things and bring them on the train yourself, it is not very dignified. In any case, do not litter paper scraps, etc., to avoid being despised. Some students sometimes eat more expensive things because they are afraid of being looked down upon. In fact, Americans are not afraid of talking about being poor, but look down on those who waste money indiscriminately (Americans call them "Sucker"). There is a smoking room available. You cannot smoke at will on the car seat. Travelers must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>In addition to taking the train, you can also take a long-distance bus. These buses also have sleeper berths, air conditioning, and other equipment, but they are not as comfortable as trains. The fare from San Francisco to Chicago is only five or six yuan cheaper than a coach seat on the train, which is not very worthwhile. On the other hand, for short trips, usually within three or four hundred miles, which takes no more than ten hours, there is the advantage of enjoying the scenery. Also, the cities passed through are mostly on the main streets, and you can hardly see the city when taking the train. Unless you divide it into several sections, it is too hard to take a long-distance bus for a long trip.</p>
<p>Whether you take the train or the bus, if a friend is picking you up at your destination, you can send a telegram in advance. A night letter is delivered the morning after it is sent. Each letter can type 50 words (name and address not included), which is cheaper. This type of telegram can be sent at the station before the train leaves or when the train stops. If you are not familiar with it, you can ask the waiter on the train to handle it for you. For the first time going abroad, it can save a lot of trouble if someone takes care of everything when you arrive at your destination!</p>
<h3>Local Transportation Agencies Increase Fares</h3>
<p>Since the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and the increase in gasoline prices, transportation businesses in this city have felt significant losses. The Transportation Association convened a meeting of its members at the beginning of last month to discuss countermeasures. After deliberation, it was decided that all fares would be increased by 30% of the original price, effective immediately. However, with gasoline prices continuing to rise, it was still impossible to maintain costs, and transportation companies had no choice but to raise prices again to protect their capital. We have inquired with the China Travel Service and the Huafu Transportation Company, a long-established and large-scale local firm, about their price increases, and the details are recorded as follows: The original price for the China Travel Service's import and export luggage was 60 cents per piece, 55 cents per piece for 21 or more pieces, 50 cents per piece for 31 or more pieces, 45 cents per piece for 51 or more pieces, 40 cents per piece for 71 or more pieces, with a minimum freight charge of one dollar. Currently, only import luggage is still charged at the original price in order to alleviate difficulties for travelers and at the expense of their own capital. All export luggage, however, has had its price revised from August 1st, as follows: 70 cents per piece, with a minimum of two dollars. 65 cents per piece for 21 or more pieces; 55 cents per piece for 31 or more pieces; 50 cents per piece for 51 or more pieces; 45 cents per piece for 71 or more pieces up to 100 pieces. For large quantities of luggage, prices are negotiable. Observing the above prices, the freight increase per piece is less than 20% of the original price, which differs from other companies. Huafu Transportation Company had increased its prices by 20% of the original price at the beginning of July, but because it still could not maintain costs, it had to increase prices again by 20% after the middle of last month. Therefore, a truck that used to cost five dollars per hour is now seven dollars per hour. The transportation of cotton yarn, which was previously calculated at 35 cents per piece, has now increased to 40 cents per piece, an increase of less than 20%. It is reported that the freight increase for other companies is around 30%.</p>
<h3>Travel Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(Answer) To Mr. Zhou Jigen: 1. The free baggage allowance on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is 30 kilograms. For each 100 kilograms of excess baggage, the charge is 32 Vietnamese piastres (approximately 16 piastres for fourth class). Baggage less than 100 kilograms will be charged proportionally. 2. It is advisable not to bring a camera when passing through Vietnam. 3. The fare for the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is 30.55 Vietnamese piastres per person for third class and 10.65 Vietnamese piastres for fourth class (one Vietnamese piastre is equivalent to approximately 3.40 national currency).</p>
<p>(Answer) To Mr. Qin En: 1. For a small package of newly purchased daily necessities, it is advisable to send it by mail if it is not carried with you. If the items are personal belongings and the quantity is not large, you will only need to pay taxes upon arrival in Vietnam and will not be penalized. Food items are tax-free. 2. The exchange rate between Hong Kong dollars and Vietnamese piastres is about the same locally as in Shanghai. It is better to exchange them in Shanghai in advance. 3. There will be no problem when disembarking in Haiphong, even if the smallpox vaccination you received did not take.</p>
<p>(Answer) To Mr. Shi Jiegeng: 1. A railway service certificate is used for identification purposes. 2. The best route from Hengyang to Guiyang is to take the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to Guilin (5.25 yuan for third class), then take the highway from Guilin to Liuzhou (10.90 yuan for the bus ticket), and then take the Southwest Highway to Guiyang (31.60 yuan for the ticket). It is said that the route via Changsha to Guiyang is currently not very smooth.</p>
<p>(Answer) To Mr. Wang Nianyuan: 1. There is no problem wearing Chinese clothing within Vietnam when traveling through Vietnam to the interior. Also, Vietnamese customs will waive taxes on newly purchased Chinese clothing in your luggage. 2. When requesting the French consulate to countersign a transit visa on your passport, you must provide a letter of guarantee issued by a reputable local business. If not, you must pay a cash deposit of 100 Vietnamese piastres as security. 3. A small amount of medication is subject to tax according to regulations, but it may be possible to make temporary arrangements. 4. The cabin fare from Shanghai to Fangfang is 82 yuan per person. The third-class train fare from Haiphong to Kunming is equivalent to 104 yuan in national currency per person. The airfare from Kunming to Chongqing is 270 yuan in national currency, including food and lodging along the way. Carrying 500 yuan in national currency for travel expenses may not be sufficient. 5. The China Travel Service has a reception desk at the Haiphong pier to assist travelers.</p>
<p>(Answer) To Mr. Zhang Qihua: 1. If the fare for taking the Italian-French postal ship from Shanghai to Singapore is too expensive, you can take a Swire Shipping Company ship instead, which is more economical. The steerage fare for this company is calculated in two sections. From Shanghai to Hong Kong is 24 yuan in national currency per person, and from Hong Kong to Singapore is 45 Hong Kong dollars per person (equivalent to over 150 yuan in national currency).</p>

<h3>Reply to Readers</h3>
<p>— Deng Bingquan</p>
<p>After announcing the temporary suspension of publication last week, this publication originally intended to publish inland transportation news in this newspaper at any time, to ensure timeliness. However, we have received many letters of criticism from readers, some saying that the original articles have not yet been completed, others saying that the travel Q&amp;A has not been fully completed, and at the very least, the existing manuscripts and letters should be brought to a conclusion. This company is grateful for the earnest supervision and guidance of readers and is even more aware of the regret of incomplete service. Therefore, we have discussed the public opinion with the Shen Bao authorities and requested a small amount of space for a short period of effort. Fortunately, the Shen Bao agreed and changed the publication to every Monday. This publication announced the suspension of publication last week, but today we meet with readers again. In fact, the week was never interrupted.</p>
<p>This company has agreed with the Shen Bao to publish six more issues. The unfinished articles will be published as much as possible, and the travel Q&amp;A will also answer each of the existing letters one by one, to live up to the expectations of all parties. For those who have new travel questions to ask, please send them directly to this company, and we will reply at any time and no longer publish them in the newspaper. We respectfully announce this and ask for your understanding.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ms. Feng Meiqi</p>
<p>Japan’s Economic Outlook, by T.A. Bisson, Foreign</p>
<p>Policy Reports, Vol. XV, No. 7 Jun. 15, 1939</p>
<p>Table (II) Government Bonds Held by the Bank of Japan (in thousands of yen)</p>
<p>As of the end of December 1938, in addition to government bonds of 14,934,733,000 yen, there were outstanding foreign debts of 1,287,994,000 yen (approximately 2,500 million yen after revaluation of debts) and government rice purchase bonds of 423,032,000 yen. Therefore, the government debt has reached 18,000 million yen, far exceeding the usual estimate of national income. If the national income of Japan in 1938 was 20,000 million yen, the figures for public debt and taxes will still be very large in its expenditure items.</p>
<p>The decision is the problem of paper currency circulation. Since 1931, the paper currency issued by the Bank of Japan has continued to increase, especially after 1936, as shown in Table (III). The figures are the actual amount of Bank of Japan paper currency in circulation. The tens of millions of yen in Bank of Japan paper currency held by the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan as currency reserves are not included. Since 1931, the increase in circulating currency has been synchronized with the recovery of production, but after 1938, the increase in currency issuance has far exceeded its industrial production.</p>
<p>In 1938, the increase in Japan's production has gradually slowed down. The increase was only 0.9%. The increase in the general index of production has been lower than the increase rate of the previous year. The divergence between production goods and consumer goods has become more and more obvious. The production goods side is still able to maintain the previous increase rate, but the consumer goods side has fallen by 8%. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy for Japan to increase production to meet the needs of the war.</p>
<p>Table (III) Circulating Currency and Industrial Production Amount of Bank of Japan Paper Currency Issued Index of Industrial Production Volume (millions of yen) (monthly average, 1931-1937 200)</p>
<p>In 1938, Japan's agricultural production decreased greatly, mainly due to the transfer of rural labor to military service. According to official estimates, the decrease in rice harvest is smaller than in other areas. The decrease in silkworm cocoon production was 1 million Kwan or 12.5%. The harvest of grains also decreased significantly. Wheat decreased from 9.4 million Kwan to 8.9 million; barley decreased from 6.9 million to 6.3 million; hulless barley decreased from 6.1 million to 5.1 million.</p>
<p>The above figures are sufficient to show the sharp reduction in the supply of consumer goods, and the reduction in the supply of agricultural production is also significant, but not as significant as the former. On the other hand, monetary wages have increased significantly. The index of factory employees in November of 1936, 1937, and 1938 was 105.5, 117.3, and 132.8. During the same period, the real wage index in factories was 91.8, 96.8, and 110.2. Although the harvest of grains was not good, due to the rise in prices, the net income of agricultural products increased slightly compared to the past. It is estimated that the income from agricultural products increased by 100 million yen compared to the previous year, from 3,654 in 1937 to 3,754 in 1938. However, at the same time, the supply of goods is becoming increasingly scarce. The Far Eastern Economic Review said: "Looking at the current situation, Japan will soon feel the shortage of daily necessities... Even if it does not create a serious situation, if the situation of supply falling short of demand continues to develop without a remedy to balance it, then the soaring of commodity prices will be expected."</p>
<p>In fact, prices have indeed risen higher than before. The average retail price index for 1936, 1937, and 1938 was 159, 174, and 191. In the same year, the average cost of living index was 185, 193, and 207. The registered index for both in December 1938 was 212, which shows that it is still increasing. The four items that increased the fastest were fuel, electricity, clothing, and food. Since July 1938, the prices of some commodities have been regulated by the government. At the same time, central and local governments also have committees to stipulate the statutory prices of some commodities and send thousands of "economic police" to be responsible for implementing them. However, the price index still rises afterwards, which proves that the official control capacity is not enough to resist the pressure of inflation.</p>
<p>The above various factors affect the standard of living of the people differently. Domestic large-scale commercial enterprises - especially munitions and heavy industry merchants - have made huge profits, some of which are over 20%; the dividends distributed are over 10%. On the other hand, some manufacturers of export industries have suffered serious blows. At the same time, the medium-sized manufacturing industries of domestic consumer goods have also been forced to reduce their scope. As a result, most of the laid-off workers have become unemployed because they do not have the skills to manufacture munitions. The official figure for the number of unemployed in March 1938 was 266,000; in fact, non-official estimates are three or four times higher. The wage rate of employed workers - especially heavy industry workers - is very high, but it is questionable whether the increase in their income can cope with the current high cost of living. Farmers have been greatly affected. It is estimated that the net income of agriculture in 1938 increased by only 100 million yen compared to the previous year, but this increase of 100 million cannot compensate for the general rise in prices. As a result, "a huge gap is created between the agricultural income index and the general price index." The agricultural income index was 101 in 1936, decreased to 93 in 1937, and is estimated to be 84 in 1938.</p>
<p>All of the above shows that every sector of the Japanese economy is becoming increasingly difficult. In today's complex economic system, we cannot determine its future, but what can be affirmed is that although the Japanese economy has not yet reached a serious crisis, there are signs of inflation, which is the result of the challenge to China. If the war zone is further expanded, the economic hardship in Japan will inevitably intensify.</p>
<p>International Economic Status</p>
<p>It is generally believed that Japan's external economic problems are more serious than its domestic economy. Japan's lack of natural resources is a major obstacle to industrial development. Raw materials such as cotton, wool, advanced machinery, and many important minerals must be imported from abroad. At present, during the war period, the demand for these raw materials is greater, so the import surplus of foreign trade is even greater.</p>
<p>From 1932 to 1936, Japan's trade once prospered. It is generally believed that the expansion of foreign trade at this time is sufficient to increase Japan's gold and foreign exchange reserves - this phenomenon occurred during the World War. In fact, although trade expanded from 1932 to 1936, the reserves did not increase. The annual import surplus was quite large - mainly due to Japan's military expansion plan and capital investment in "Manchukuo", as a result, the trade balance was not good.</p>
<p>In 1931, Japan's total foreign trade was 2,383 million yen, which was the lowest level since 1916. Since 1932 - as shown in Table (IV) - it began to rise, reaching its highest level in 1937, and then began to decline again. Now looking at the situation from 1932 to 1936: Japan's trade developed extremely significantly in these years. In 1934, it even exceeded the high level of 1929, and the total from 1935 to 1936 increased by 1 trillion yen. On the other hand, trade became a trade surplus in one year. However, the total import surplus in five years was 2,320 million yen.</p>
<p>Table (IV) Japan's Commodity Trade (millions of yen)</p>
<p>In addition to the trade deficit, Japan also exported huge amounts of capital, as shown in Table (V). During these years, Japan's capital investment abroad increased significantly. These two items are the two major items on Japan's expenditure account. On the income side, the main sources are the following three: public services, such as transportation, remittances, commercial and industrial profits; export of gold and silver; and the return of Japan's early investments abroad. The last item increased with the year. In 1935, the Japanese purchased silver privately exported from China at yen prices, which gave Japan huge unexpected benefits. There was no such income in 1936, but in that year, Japan's investment abroad reached 652.4 million yen. Gold has not been exported since it stopped being exported in 1933, but every effort has been made to recover foreign investment assets - reducing by 485 million yen in 1936.</p>
<p>Table (V) Net Difference in Japan's Balance of Payments (millions of yen)</p>
<p>From 1932 to 1936, Japan's national assets had an additional increase, and production efficiency also improved. On the other hand, Japan's international economic status declined day by day. The country's trade had a huge deficit, and a large amount of capital was also lost day by day. Most of this capital was invested in "Manchukuo", which was unprofitable or had no profits to be made recently, so the result was a significant loss.</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1937, Japan's foreign exchange and securities reserves gradually showed signs of depletion. On January 8, 1937, the Finance Minister proposed an approval system to control foreign exchange. Two months later, he began to export gold in large quantities. The trade deficit in the first half of the year was quite large, and then the Sino-Japanese War broke out suddenly in July and August, and the situation became even more serious. The authorities had no choice but to strengthen the control of imported goods and try to reduce the import of non-essential goods. In addition, they re-evaluated the gold reserves of the banks of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and proposed 1,548 million yen to maintain currency and adjust international accounts. Therefore, in 1937 and 1938, the war continued to expand, and the reason why the Japanese authorities were able to calmly cope with the needs of munitions was due to the effective control of foreign exchange and the effective use of gold.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Japan's commodity trade has also undergone great changes. As shown in Table (VI), trade in the Japanese Empire reached an unprecedented high level in 1937, but imports far exceeded exports, resulting in a trade deficit of 636 million yen. By 1938, imports were strictly restricted, and the import surplus was reduced by 1,119 million yen. Exports also decreased by 422 million yen due to the lack of raw material imports and the resistance from all over the world to Japan, resulting in a trade surplus of 600 million yen.</p>
<p>The above figures only refer to the foreign trade of Japan and its territories, and do not refer to the trade situation between Japan and its territories. The trade between Japan and its territories and "Manchukuo" has recently developed greatly. In 1937, the yen group included "Manchukuo" and its territories (Korea, Taiwan, and the South Seas Mandate), and in 1938, it also included parts of the Chinese coast and inland areas. Therefore, in the last year, the trade between China and Japan was also included in the yen group. From the "actual total" in Table (VI), it can be seen that the trade figures from 1937 to 1938 have been reorganized to make accurate estimates of the trade between Japan and the yen group, and the trade between Japan and countries with free exchange. In addition, there are also figures for 1936 to show the direction of changes in the two years.</p>
<p>Table (VI) Distribution of Japan's Trade (millions of yen)</p>
<p>(Note) (1) Foreign trade of Japan and its territories</p>
<p>(2) Trade between Japan and the world, Korea and Taiwan</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the development of Japan's trade within the yen group has slightly offset the trade deficit of Japan. The trade between Japan and countries with free exchange has a deficit of 329,926,574 million yen in the last three years. The deficit decreased by 352 million yen in 1938 alone. Exports to countries with free exchange decreased by 1,038 million (40.5%) in that year, and imports were forced to decrease by 1,390 million (39.8%), which shows the magnitude of the loss. In other words, the reduction of the 352 million yen deficit has resulted in the loss of two-fifths of Japan's trade with countries with free exchange (including imports and exports).</p>
<p>At the same time, Japan's trade situation within the yen group is also not good. In this aspect, Japan's imports from the yen group should exceed exports to make up for the shortage of Japan's production and reduce the import of foreign goods. In fact, it is the opposite. In 1938, the trade between Japan and the yen group had a surplus of 753 million yen. Among them, the main export was cotton textiles, which were made of imported raw cotton, so Japan's foreign exchange became even more strained. However, the import figures increased year by year, but the increase was slower; in 1938, its imports totaled 1,489 million yen, accounting for about one-third of Japan's total imports. The goods imported from the yen group countries to Japan are mostly food (rice, sugar, soybeans), followed by coal, iron, and a small amount of raw cotton wool. In addition, Japan needs to purchase machinery, oil, rubber, large quantities of metals, most of the raw cotton wool, and some semi-finished metal products from abroad. Since Japan's exports to countries with free exchange have gradually declined and its domestic gold reserves have gradually decreased, the import of these items has also become increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>The balance of Japan's international accounts in 1937 and 1938 depended on the export of coins and gold and silver bars. In recent years, the figures for Japan's invisible trade have been announced, and the number of gold and silver shipments is obtained from the statistics of the importing countries (mainly the United States). The export in 1937 was 892 million yen, and the export in 1938 was 634 million yen. And this export is roughly in line with Japan's import payments to countries with free exchange, with import payments of 926 million yen in 1937 and 574 million yen in 1938. Since Japan's imports are so large and must be paid for with gold exports, how long can Japan's gold reserves last?</p>
<p>Three-quarters of Japan's gold reserves were used to pay for foreign expenditures between 1937 and 1938. In total, Japan has had a total of 2.250 billion yen in gold in recent years, of which 1.550 billion yen was retained after the revaluation of gold, 400 million yen was stored abroad before the revaluation, and 300 million yen was produced within 18 months after the outbreak of the war. Its use was 1.450 billion yen shipped abroad, 300 million yen for import and export funds, and 500 million yen for the gold reserve of the Bank of Japan on January 1, 1939. As a result, Japan's net savings are only 500 million yen, and the estimated production amount for this year is 200 million yen. If Japan's trade with countries with free exchange cannot be improved, this 700 million yen of gold reserves will still be used to pay for international payments in 1939. Looking at the trade figures for the first few months of 1939, exports to countries with free exchange are still declining, and imports are maintaining the level of 1938, which shows that the trade balance has regressed and not progressed.</p>
<p>If the situation becomes more serious, Japan will undoubtedly seek help from other sources of foreign exchange. For example, imports from countries with free exchange can still be reduced; the raw materials needed for the war or export industries can be restricted more strictly; there are some items under foreign investment assets that can be used. Gold and silver jewelry in Japan have been forcibly collected, but they cannot exceed 50 or 60 million yen. Japan is currently unable to monopolize China's commerce. If the control of currency and foreign exchange in North China can be implemented, Japan can use the profits from foreign trade in that region to make up for its foreign exchange deficit. However, whether it will succeed is difficult to say. Since the Anglo-Japanese Agreement was signed, China's customs revenue has been transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank. In 1938, Japan obtained 7.5 million yen in foreign exchange in this area. However, in the future, it is feared that the Japanese side will be paid in yen or local currency. Table (VI) shows that Japan's imports from mainland China were very small in 1938, accounting for less than 1%. The imports of raw cotton, coal, and iron have all declined greatly, and only salt is more important. At present, during the war period, China is not as much of an economic asset to Japan as "Manchukuo". And in 1938, Japan's exports to mainland China were several times its imports. Due to the chaotic currency situation, Japan's trade with China often causes its funds to escape to foreign concessions, and its accurate estimate is not available, but the amount must be small.

<h3>Japanese Manpower Shortage</h3>
<p>Japan needs a large army on the vast battlefields in China; under China's tactics of attrition warfare, the Japanese army has lost nearly a million men. The war zone is still expanding, but Japan's manpower is in a crisis of being unable to keep up. All the newspapers and magazines in Japan are full of discussions on countermeasures for the shortage of Japanese labor; factory owners do not hesitate to lure workers with high wages, and the government has to maintain the labor force of military factories with labor control; women workers bear the brunt in rural fishing and forestry due to the sharp reduction in labor; as a result, the sharp reduction in production is inevitable. More fatally, because most of the strong men have been forced to come to China and died one after another, most of the women in the country have become widows in disguise. The birth rate has been drastically reduced. At the same time, due to the extreme lack of domestic prices and the implementation of strict thrift, the health of the people has been greatly damaged, so the mortality rate is increasing instead. The following is the confession of his cabinet's statistics bureau.</p>
<h3>Finance: The Gold Market Was Not Open Yesterday, and the Mood of the Industry Turned Weary</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of cash red chip trading was closed due to the weekly holiday, so there was no formal market price. However, according to the mood of the industry, it seemed to have turned slightly weary. It was heard that many positions were sold off-market, because it was reported that Britain, the United States, and France were about to cooperate to restrain Japan and aid China. Although it has not yet been implemented, it seems possible, and the situation in Germany and Poland is becoming increasingly tense, with a great sense of imminent danger, which inevitably dampened people's hearts slightly. It was heard that floating households commissioned money changers to sell at 3,840 yuan, but only a few buyers offered 3,820 yuan, so no transaction was heard. The exchange rate for gold jewelry in silver shops has not changed, with Da Tong Heng still quoting 390 yuan and Xin Tong Heng at 388 yuan, with a reduction of 20 yuan for purchases. Also, according to a London dispatch on the 5th, British pure gold was still at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6.5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Recent and Distant Silver Both Rise; Spot Silver Steady</h3>
<p>London, 5th: The silver market saw Indian buying and short covering, keeping the market stable. Spot and forward silver both rose by 1.25. New York silver report: US spot prices remained steady. Bombay silver report: The Indian silver market was calm; spot prices continued to rise by four annas, while futures remained unchanged. A total of 100 contracts were traded, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined Sugar Strengthens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to make progress. The guild marked up prices. Spot prices for No. 24 crude white sugar rose by 50 cents, to $33.50 at local godowns and $33.30 at foreign godowns. Re-export sugar rose by 22 cents, to $25.20. Taikoo granulated sugar rose by 45 cents, to $38.20 at East godowns and $38.45 at West godowns for B Mark, $38 for CW Mark, $37.70 for CX Mark, $37.40 at East godowns and 20 cents at West godowns for DY Mark, and $37.20 at West godowns for HX Mark. Dutch red sugar and red sugar remained unchanged. Local refined white sugar rose another 50 cents, to $33.50 for Zhenji No. 1, $33 for No. 2, $22.50 for No. 3, and $32 for No. 4. The state-owned sugar company only announced prices and did not make many changes, only offering 72 bags of Gao Banqing at $25.70.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Haikou Lychee is on the Way</h3>
<p>In previous years, Haikou dried lychees were the first new product to appear on the market. Due to transportation difficulties this year, they have been delayed. It is now reported that a small quantity has been shipped and is en route, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, it is said.</p>
<h3>Both Branches and Lotus Seeds are Showing New Products</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Lan Bamboo branches have some mold and need to be re-dried. The yield after drying is 95%, so the market price has been raised by $5 and is now selling for $85. It is also reported that a telegram was received from Zhangzhou stating that there may be a ban on exports. If this is not resolved, prices are expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>New white lotus seeds from Lanxi have already arrived on the market. Five barrels have been transferred from Ningbo, but have not yet been released. They may be able to compete with Xiang lotus seeds.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Fungus Near $300</h3>
<p>Sichuan fungus is currently experiencing a shortage of arrivals due to restrictions on exports, causing market prices to rise repeatedly. Yesterday, a batch was offered at a price of $290, an increase of more than $28. However, even if it were possible to import now, the cost of foreign exchange alone would require $180 in cash. Other expenses can be imagined. Therefore, the trend is expected to tighten further.</p>
<h3>Coal: Zhufeng Coal Sells Well; Uncertain that North China Coal Will be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors in the market that a certain party will ship North China coal to Shanghai for dumping. However, after extensive inquiries by reporters, there is no evidence of this. Moreover, most of the coal stored in Pudong is supplied to the military by a certain party and is not for sale. Only a small amount of Zhufeng coal is being released by a certain foreign firm. The price of unified coal at Pudong godowns is $42 per ton, and lump coal is $46. Other high-quality coal, such as Pacific coal, is being held and is not expected to be sold, it is said.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Yellow Croaker Maw Soars</h3>
<p>Yellow croaker maw has continued to be in demand recently. However, inventory is very low, spot prices are high, and selling prices are rising. The current market price for Ningbo hanging maw is $175, and local hanging maw is $200, a significant increase of $30 to $40 compared to previous prices.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Angle Iron Sales are Not Strong</h3>
<p>Due to high prices, business in hardware is unusually quiet. Sales of new angle iron yesterday were limited to the local market, with no purchases from other locations. However, prices continue to rise and show no signs of falling. Prices rose again by $2 to $3 yesterday. One-inch iron is selling for $29, two-inch iron for $17, and two-and-a-half-inch iron for $26. The asking price for three-inch iron is between $26 and $25.75 (unit: per market picul). Only 200 to 300 piculs were sold.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York's July Statistics Show Decline in Raw Silk Consumption; Prospects for Chinese Silk Sales to the US</h3>
<p>According to Reuters, New York's raw silk situation in July shows that actual sales have generally been declining in recent months. Although the abolition of the US-Japan trade agreement will not take effect until next spring, US merchants' interest in purchasing Japanese silk seems to have gradually waned over the past ten months. New York's raw silk imports in July amounted to 32,681 bales, an increase of more than 10,000 bales compared to the previous month, but sales amounted to only 26,142 bales. Although this figure is only a decrease of 114 bales compared to the previous month, it is worth noting that since January of this year, the total monthly silk sales in the United States have been gradually declining from 41,599 bales to more than one-third. From this perspective, prospects for Chinese silk sales to the US seem to be improving. The attached statistics on US raw silk in July are provided for reference (unit: bales).</p>
<p>Fifteen shipments of raw silk were transported to Hong Kong on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Statistics: The Rising Cost of Living; Food and Housing Prices Increase Without End</h3>
<p>The housing problem in this city is becoming increasingly serious. The second survey of rents this year was conducted in July. The rent index for this month was 282.41, an increase of 4.67% compared to the index from January to June of this year, and an increase of 9.37% compared to the index from June to December of last year. Rent increases varied for different types of housing. Rents for Western-style houses increased by 6.91%, shikumen houses by 6.69%, and bungalow rents increased the least, by 0.90%. Among the houses surveyed this month, 29.31% experienced rent increases, of which 17.24% were due to increased water charges, 6.90% were due to new tenants being charged higher rents after old tenants moved out, and 5.17% were due to discretionary rent increases. Since the outbreak of the war, rents for all types of housing in this city have been repeatedly increased. To protect the interests of tenants, the court has rejected rent increases exceeding 20% or repeated rent increases within a short period of time. As a result, many landlords have used the excuse of increased tenants and soaring water charges to increase water charges, and the amount increased often far exceeds the actual water consumption. This type of increase in water charges is actually a disguised form of rent increase.</p>
<p>After a sharp rise in rice prices in June, prices gradually declined at the beginning of this month, largely due to hot weather and distress selling by hoarders. On July 17th, after consultation between the Standing Bureaus of the two concessions and the Rice Merchants Association, a notice was issued again to suppress price limits. The maximum selling price for high-quality japonica rice was not allowed to exceed $20 per picul, and for guest indica rice, it was not allowed to exceed $16. As soon as the price limits were set, the exchange rate changed dramatically, and merchants hoarded goods and refused to sell, causing prices to rise. However, the authorities, prioritizing the people's food supply, insisted on maintaining the price limits. As a result, the market saw cases of selling goods at high prices against the rules, and high-quality goods almost disappeared. Later, the chaos intensified, and the market became nominal. Under-the-table transactions often exceeded the price limits, but they were mostly private transactions without formal receipts to avoid violating the price limits. By the end of the month, the authorities of the two concessions jointly investigated rice warehouses, and speculators eager to sell off their holdings, causing market prices to rebound slightly.</p>
<p>Retail prices generally trended upwards. Among food items, meat and vegetables saw the most significant increases. Salted meat rose by 59.78% compared to the previous month, fresh meat by 11.52%, green vegetables by 41.82%, radishes by 27.27%, and chives by 25.76%. Other fresh fish, duck eggs, white sugar, etc., also experienced strong price increases. Due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, the price of coal briquettes rose, reaching as high as $2.60 to $2.80 per picul, with an average price of $2.08 for the whole month, an increase of 14.64% compared to the previous month. The index for this month, the previous month, and the same month last year are listed below for comparison (prices in 1936 are used as the base).</p>

<h3>Air-Conditioned Environment</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>In hot weather, wealthy people must ensure their homes have a suitable temperature. Of course, the most comfortable cool house is one equipped with air conditioning.</p>
<p>Air conditioning is manufactured using mechanical power. The transformation of "energy" in matter is not complicated in scientific principle. Nitrogen (a type of ammonia) is liquefied using high pressure, and then the pressure is reduced to return it to a gaseous state. This requires the supply of a large amount of heat, which is absorbed from every gap in the room. Therefore, the temperature in this room gradually drops. People who have been walking around in air above 90 degrees feel very cool when they enter a place with air conditioning. However, this type of air conditioning equipment costs a lot of money, so only a few large companies and entertainment venues in the city have this luxurious amenity.</p>
<p>Some people consider themselves to be physically weak, and are therefore afraid of air conditioning. They are often hesitant to enter air-conditioned rooms. This fear is unwarranted. If you enter an air-conditioned environment too quickly after sweating profusely, a weak person may not be able to resist the stimulus and may easily suffer from illnesses such as suppressed sweating or catching a cold. However, strong people are not affected at all. If you have not been sweating profusely, it is fine to work or be entertained in an air-conditioned environment without harming your physical or mental health. In general, a person's body needs to be trained to resist cold and heat. For example, people who are accustomed to taking cold showers will not get sick from the cold. Many elderly politicians in London and Washington work in air-conditioned environments all day long and do not completely lose their lives. However, it must be stated here that a truly luxurious air-conditioned environment is well-suited for people wearing suits. If necessary, just put on a "jacket"!</p>
<h3>Talking About Summer Clothes in Summer</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>As soon as the weather gets hot, all cotton clothes and lined clothes make people feel disgusted, and all kinds of light shirts and cool clothes are now in season. The original summer fabrics of our country, such as pongee, cloud gauze, and summer cloth, are all exquisite and cool. Those who want to make summer clothes can find them among these fabrics, so why rely on imported goods and spend foreign exchange!</p>
<p>Pongee: Pongee is clean, white, soft, and the best of summer fabrics. "Real gold is not afraid of fire." Although artificial silk summer fabrics are being sold on the market in large quantities, pongee still maintains its highest position. When it comes to summer fabrics, nothing else compares! Whether making long clothes, short clothes, men's robes, or women's robes, Chinese or Western style, pongee is suitable for everything. The producing areas of pongee are in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, but Hangzhou's Hangzhou pongee and Shengze's Sheng pongee are the most famous.</p>
<p>Cloud Gauze: Cloud gauze is also called kao silk and is a specialty of Guangdong. The texture is extremely strong. A garment can often be worn for six or seven years before it tears. The selling price is not too high, and washing is very convenient, so it is most popular among the general public! It is also light, cool, and breathable. Wearing it in summer is very cool and comfortable. In recent years, it is common to see women using it to make cheongsams. Wearing it is not only beautiful, but also restores rights and interests (you can wear one less cheongsam made of imported raw materials). This is very worthwhile to promote.</p>
<p>Summer Cloth: Xia cloth from Wanzai, Jiangxi, is famous far and wide. There are coarse and fine varieties. Wearing it is cool and light. It was originally the most common summer clothing in our country. Unfortunately, in recent years, imported summer fabrics have been dumped at low prices, and summer cloth is gradually being eliminated! Just looking at the once-popular summer cloth long gowns, which are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, it is clear how much the sales of summer cloth have declined! In fact, summer cloth is both strong and washable, and wearing it feels generous. Compared with imported summer fabrics, it is no less good. So why should we abandon this for that!</p>
<h3>National Goods Feast Worth Promoting</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Since the City Chamber of Commerce advised all industries to stop using shark fins in banquets, although few people have implemented it, it cannot be said that there have been no results. However, "if you don't eat shark fins, you change to other precious delicacies, such as bird's nest, sea cucumber, abalone, etc., then it doesn't really fit the principle of thrift, and the path to reducing leakage is even more distant; and because of the soaring prices, the prices of banquets have increased. If we don't urgently seek a way to reform, the middle and lower-paid classes will be embarrassed by the face-social customs, and when they encounter necessary celebratory banquets, they really suffer from unbearable burdens. Therefore, I believe that promoting national goods banquets to reduce the prices of banquets is currently an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Below, I will try to open a menu of national goods banquets for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Four Main Dishes: Chicken Congee with Fish Maw, Clear Stewed Whole Duck, Golden and Silver Trotters, White Juice Mandarin Fish. (2) Six Hot Dishes: Stir-Fried Shrimp Meat, Carambola with White Fungus, Braised Chicken with Mushrooms, Braised Fish Maw, Yunnan Ham, Fried Twin Tails. (3) Two Desserts: Bean Paste Buns, Chicken Wonton. (4) Others: Four Combination Platters, Four-Color Fruits, Melon Seeds for Each Guest.</p>
<p>The price of the above menu is 10 to 11 yuan per table in larger restaurants, and 8 to 9 yuan or around 7 yuan in smaller restaurants and kitchens, which is 4 to 6 yuan lower than "shark fin dishes" or dishes with other precious delicacies (of course, this is still calculated based on the minimum shark fin dishes). This is much easier for middle and lower-class citizens to afford.</p>
<p>Regarding this, we hope that the society and various industry organizations will actively expand and promote it to break the system of face-saving and reduce the suffering of citizens. At the same time, the leisured and propertied classes are also worth emulating and promoting, because the money saved from these celebrations and banquets can be donated to the refugees in greater proportions.</p>
<p>(Short Message) Zhou Mengxian, the general manager of the China DeSoto Automobile Company at 167 Yu Qiaqing Road, who handles Chrysler DeSoto passenger cars and trucks known for their economy and durability, traveled to Hong Kong last spring to observe the automobile industry. Due to a large number of orders from the government, he remained in Hong Kong to establish an office and factory. He only took the time to return to Shanghai last week. Mr. Zhou is well-connected and has been entertaining relatives and friends every night, it is said.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Summer is the most fashionable season for melons. Fruits such as watermelon, cantaloupe, and golden melon are indeed in full swing. Whether rich or poor, everyone wants to try them. Among vegetables, winter melon, cucumber, and loofah are holding the fort, and they occupy an important position as well. Winter melon and cucumber can be used in both meat and vegetarian dishes. Loofah is a mainstay in vegetarian dishes and is never used in meat dishes. Winter melon can be cooked in many ways. Ham winter melon soup is both fresh and clear, and it is the best soup dish to eat with rice. For white-stewed pork knuckle, which is usually cooked with radish, winter melon can now be used as a substitute. Further on, white-stewed chicken, white-stewed duck, etc., also need the cooperation of winter melon. As for vegetarian cooking methods, such as braised vegetarian winter melon and winter melon braised with tofu, they are also very delicious. Cucumber stir-fried with seasonal shrimp is the most common meat dish, but unfortunately, shrimp prices are too expensive, and we cannot eat it often. Other dishes, such as bean starch sheets mixed with cucumber and pickled cucumber, are also simple and flavorful. Loofah stir-fried with Wuxi gluten is naturally rich and delicious, and the red-braised vegetarian ten-scene dish cannot do without it.</p>
<p>Monday: Winter Melon Ham Soup, Braised Small White Fish, Cucumber Mixed with Bean Starch Sheets, Stir-Fried Green Vegetables with Bean Vermicelli.</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion Beef Shreds, Sweet and Sour Yellow Croaker Slices, Stir-Fried Red Amaranth, Stewed Fermented Bean Curd.</p>
<p>Wednesday: Chives Stir-Fried with Pork Shreds, Cucumber Stir-Fried with Seasonal Shrimp, Red Braised Vegetarian Ten-Scene Dish, Chinese Toon Mixed with Tofu.</p>
<p>Thursday: Dried Vegetables Braised with Pork, Sweet and Sour Squid, Loofah and Bean Vermicelli Stir-Fried with Gluten, Vegetable Soybean Sprouts.</p>
<p>Friday: Curry Beef Slices, Pickled Mustard Greens Egg Drop Soup, Beijing Winter Vegetable Bean Starch Sheets, Braised Cabbage.</p>
<p>Saturday: Winter Melon White-Stewed Meat, Dry-Braised Ribbon Fish, Dried Tofu Shreds, Tea Soybean Sprouts, Stir-Fried Cabbage with Bean Curd Sheets.</p>
<p>Sunday: Minced Meat Fried with Sauce, Fish Soup, Braised Eggplant, Stir-Fried Celery.</p>
<h3>Using Science to Improve Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>Humans appeared on Earth 200,000 years ago. However, at that time, humans were covered in hair, had no clothes to wear, ate only animal meat and plant fruits, and lived in caves or forests, almost like animals. It was not until the last 5,000 years that humans conquered various beasts and gradually progressed.</p>
<p>It was not easy for humans to conquer beasts. We do not have the strong legs of a deer to run, nor the sharp claws of a tiger to defend ourselves, nor the hard armor to cover our entire body, nor the venom to kill enemies; yet humans finally triumphed. What did we rely on?</p>
<p>The biggest reason why humans were able to conquer beasts is that humans have brains to think and hands to do things that various animals cannot do. Humans relied on this innate power to use science to reduce their labor and improve their lives. After more than 3,000 years of research and improvement, our lives have reached their current state. Without science, how could we have reached this point? Therefore, science is the guiding light of human life, and a great history of science is the history of human life. Now, I will discuss the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation separately:</p>
<p>(1) Clothing: Raising silkworms to obtain silk is a method that has been popular in our country since ancient times. However, this rudimentary method is very troublesome. First, planting mulberry trees takes a lot of human effort. Then, feeding silkworms with mulberry leaves until they can spin silk and make cocoons also requires a lot of effort. Humans have used this troublesome method to obtain silk for almost 2,000 years. Scientists are people who do improvement work, and they certainly cannot easily ignore this matter, which has a significant relationship with human life. Therefore, since 1855, scientists have come up with simple methods to turn plant fibers into things like silk without the need to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms. Around 1892, the rayon currently in use was invented. Silk turns yellow when it comes into contact with sweat, but rayon does not. Silk's reflectivity to light is not as good as rayon's, and rayon's strength and thickness can be made according to human will, which silk can never do. Therefore, the production and sales of rayon worldwide exceed those of silk.</p>
<p>(2) Food: Human dietary habits have a history of thousands of years. In the past, vegetarians did not want to eat meat, and meat-eaters were not accustomed to vegetarian food. Scientists have made a lot of effort to reconcile these two habits. The difference between vegetarian and meat food is only the different sources of fat. If it is possible to find a way to turn vegetable oil into animal oil, such "artificial fat" could be eaten by both vegetarians and meat-eaters. After research by many scientists, this ideal has finally been realized, so since 1900, artificial fat has gradually been sold on the market.</p>
<p>(3) Housing: Because people want to obtain comfort and happiness, human residences and utensils have gradually been invented. Since the number of humans on Earth is increasing year by year, to prevent panic in living spaces, it is necessary to change from occupying ground to occupying space. With the invention of steel and concrete construction methods, it is not difficult to build multi-story buildings. The 70-story buildings in New York City in the United States are undoubtedly very impressive. Scientists have put a lot of effort into creating utensils: using hot water fins to keep out the cold, using cold water fins to keep out the heat, using electric current to pass through metal wires to emit light, making electric lamps, so that when it gets dark at night, the light shines, almost like the sun.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation: The power that nature gives to humans is very weak. We cannot carry heavy things or walk long distances. Without fins, we cannot swim in the water. Without wings, we cannot fly in the air. People with superior brains and hands often want to break through these difficulties. After research by countless people and long-term improvement, using water power and wind power to work for humans has gradually become a reality. By the 11th century, scientists found steam and electricity that were greater than water power and wind power. It became very easy to transport heavy things to fast places. Swimming in the water or flying in the air has also become a reality. Bushnell made a submarine that can travel in the water, and the Wright brothers invented the airplane, allowing people to move freely in the water and in the air.</p>
<p>The above are some of the most significant facts about how science has improved human life. Since science, humans have gradually shed their barbaric lives. Various inventions that save labor and save time have gradually led humans to the road of culture, and we have obtained more peaceful and happy lives. Therefore, using science can create our new life.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Fear and Gratitude</h3>
<p>— Yu Ling</p>
<p>News came from friends at the Shanghai Drama Society that the premiere of "Night Shanghai" is scheduled. Normally, as the playwright of this play, I myself would feel excited and happy. However, this time, replacing the excitement and happiness are fear and gratitude.</p>
<p>In the past, due to my love for theater, I studied playwriting, acting like a fearless newborn calf. Reality forced me to speak my mind. I did not seek playwriting skills, nor did I calculate success or failure. In the so-called playwriting drought of missing scripts, occasionally a play was staged, merely as a "filler." In the performances of "Women's Apartment" and "Tears on Flowers," although I received guidance from insightful theater critics and encouragement from enthusiastic theatergoers, every time I reflected, I felt more uneasy and dissatisfied. I almost made a private decision to never dare to act recklessly again, to bury myself in study for ten years, and then meet with those who love and expect from me.</p>
<p>Two and a half months ago, my lively and healthy eighteen-month-old child, unfortunately due to negligence in care, fell ill for two months and eventually died, without leaving a single photo, without even leaving a name. Outside the window, the moonlight was white, and the intermittent sounds came:</p>
<p>The crescent moon shines on the nine provinces,</p>
<p>Some families rejoice, some families grieve!</p>
<p>Some couples share the same embroidered bed?</p>
<p>Some drift and wander far away?</p>
<p>It sang so desolately that I couldn't sit still and rushed out the door. I saw F originally wanting to comfort me, but the scene turned into "speechless," bathed in the moonlight in a daze. Silence, instead, aroused her homesickness. So, from the scene of "raising my head to look at the bright moon, lowering my head to think of my hometown," she finally recited:</p>
<p>Years have passed since I visited Hejiang Garden,</p>
<p>Talking about the past breaks my heart!</p>
<p>Only the plum blossoms know this hatred,</p>
<p>Meeting under the moon, yet speechless.</p>
<p>Under this bright moon, she was again depressed and sad, as if weeping and complaining, stirring up my old and new hatreds. From this point, the encounter of the Mei family in "Night Shanghai" was conceived.</p>
<p>Suddenly taking up the pen, I impulsively forgot the failures of the past and rushed to finish a five-act play as messy as a pile of grass.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friends at the Shanghai Drama Society for not giving up and arranging for it to be the first play for the opening of the Xuan Palace Theater and the long-term performance of the Drama Society. For me, it is such a fearful and humbling thing! I am fearful that the Drama Society is taking a risk, and I have dared to act recklessly again.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Mr. Li Jianwu, Gu Zhongyi, Wu Renzhi, and Chen Ximu for giving me many valuable opinions. I am even more grateful to Mr. Zhu Duanjun, who calmly responded to the challenge. Not only was he willing to direct this script, which was rushed and had minor flaws, but he also carefully read each act after it was written, giving me many insightful and thoughtful instructions. Limited by censorship and performance time, Mr. Zhu painstakingly cut out some scenes and refined the essence during the directing process, making "Night Shanghai" more complete. I have always maintained that under the direction of a skilled director, the playwright only provides some materials for the play. A script is not much more valuable than a piece of triangular wood used to make scenery. In the performance of "Night Shanghai," I only contributed a piece of wood. If there is anything worth seeing, it is all thanks to Mr. Zhu's direction and the acting skills of the actors.</p>
<p>"Night Shanghai" bathed in the new Xuan Palace, premiered. In addition to fear, I sincerely thank you!</p>
<h3>Does the Soul Really Exist?</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the soul exists, many people have not yet resolved it. Some people say: Life in this world is about eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure. When you die, it's over. Why bother studying the soul? Others say: What you can see is real, what you can't see is fake. The soul is not seen anywhere. Still others say: When a person dies, it's like a lamp going out, returning to nothingness. What soul or no soul. Some also say: A person has three souls and six spirits. After death, one soul stays in the ancestral hall, one soul is in the grave, and one soul goes to be reincarnated. Even more people say: The three souls and six spirits are just scattered souls and lost spirits. When a person dies, the soul scatters and the spirit falls. These are the general people's views on the soul. Everyone, please think for yourselves, does the soul really exist? Do not parrot others, because this is very important! It concerns the eternal life of you and me. We must always think, go through deep consideration, what is reasonable is right, what is unreasonable is wrong, and we must not have preconceived notions. Now we will explain according to the truth, does the soul really exist? Spirit and soul are different! Limiting ourselves to just talking about the soul, I can also say that it is life. Minerals are called fixed substances, they have no life. Plants are said to have a kind of life, we can say that they grow, so plants can bloom and bear fruit, passing on seeds and generations, continuously. Animals are one level higher than plants. In addition to the soul of growth, they also have a soul of perception, so animals can feel pain, heat, hunger, and thirst, and also slightly know the relationships of closeness, love, and hate, etc. People are one level higher than animals. In addition to having the soul of growth and the soul of perception, they also have a precious soul. So people can not only grow and perceive, but also think about all kinds of things in the past and the future! Now I will describe the various reasons why people have souls below; (to be continued) Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelism Society, P.O. Box 1227</p>
<h3>Introducing Novel Technical Attempts</h3>
<p>— Wu Renzhi</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Chinese drama must have a change. But the initial results will not be pure. Because the system is not established, it will inevitably be mixed. So those who are more conservative may criticize the entire form because they see the dregs in the middle. Those who are more progressive may blindly pursue novelty for the sake of partial success. Or it may even cause controversy, but significant progress may start from this.</p>
<p>The performance of drama in the inland areas, of course, takes the effectiveness of propaganda as the first priority, so it often tries to accommodate the audience as much as possible. The innovation of the performance style is actually also a way to cater to the audience's psychology. From the news sent by friends in the inland areas, we can know that their performance methods are changing with each passing day. It is a pity that they are working hard for the motherland and for the anti-aggression propaganda every day. There is not a moment to study the artistic position of various methods, and how to use them artistically. They are like pioneers in land reclamation. They don't have time to do geological analysis or planting research because there is still a lot of hard land reclamation work waiting for them. But not doing research is a defect, a regret. To make up for this defect and regret, it seems that only we who are left on the isolated island can do it. But this is ultimately a matter of trial and error, who will do it?</p>
<p>I remember that long before the War of Resistance, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian came back from his inspection in the Soviet Union and used two methods of the performance school in directing "Sunrise": one was a half-cut, top-through device, and the other was a mirror without a mirror surface. The former increased the realism of piling and building houses, and the latter completed close-up shots. At that time, it did attract people's attention, but later there was never any new continuation on the formal stage.</p>
<p>Now, we have to thank Mr. Yu Ling, who actually made a bold attempt in "Night Shanghai," trying two things: one is that there is no one on the bed, and the other is the use of shadow play. We should not speculate in advance about the effect. Now I want to give an introduction from a theoretical point of view:</p>
<p>Starting from Object Symbolism</p>
<p>When talking about "symbolism" in theatrical performances, we always think of Peking Opera, because Peking Opera is full of symbolic performances. For example, a horse whip, from the groom leading it to the rider getting on the horse, is completely treated as a horse. After getting on the horse, pointing it behind the back and waving it a few times, it is already being treated as a whip. After a few flourishes, the whip may become a short stick pointing here and there during the singing and recitation. Yes, this is called the performance of object symbolism. However, if you look at it from this perspective and want to understand the performance of symbolism, then it is really "climbing a tree to catch a fish." Using a whip for three purposes is only the surface of the symbolic performance. It has its own valuable artistic performance in other aspects.</p>
<p>Let's take an example: There is a scene in "Walking Maicheng" that is dedicated to depicting the situation of the mount being lost and unable to move forward. At that time, every posture can make you praise it. I believe that if it were really on horseback, there would be no such performance. Another example is Hua Shanshan going downstairs, and suddenly falling down halfway. Showing how delicate she is. You say, if it were really on the escalator, wouldn't it look so clumsy? This is to say that symbolic acting can have beauty that exceeds what realism depicts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for example, in the "Sitting in the Palace" scene of "Stealing the Order," the child in the princess's hand can only be fake. But, even if it were possible, it is actually better not to hold a real one. Because the subject of that scene is the princess. For the sake of the child, it will take away the main component of the princess. Moreover, think about it, if the princess is holding a real child, how clumsy will the princess's posture be? This is to say that symbolic performances can sometimes especially strengthen the subject.</p>
<p>Now, in "Night Shanghai," Yun Gu's mother was originally sick in bed until she died, but now there is no one on the bed from beginning to end. This is the use of symbolic performance techniques: strengthening Yun Gu's main performance and giving Yun Gu the opportunity to perform the beauty of transcendence in description.</p>
<p>Starting from Intentional Symbolism</p>
<p>In terms of stage performance, if the scene being symbolized is outside the visible scene, we call it intentional symbolism. The use of shadow play is actually the use of the performance method of intentional symbolism.</p>
<p>I heard from friends that shadow play is used a lot in the inland areas, and because the lines are hard, it has a good effect. However, this is the first time that it has been formally adopted from an artistic point of view. In fact, this technique is often used in movies. When the plot develops to a certain point, it will come with a series of quick sketch shots. The current shadow play is equivalent to this type of shot.</p>
<p>Generally, people think that realism and symbolism are two completely irreconcilable methods, especially object symbolism. This experiment can solve part of this problem. In addition to introducing two new technical attempts, I would like to draw attention to one point in particular.</p>

<h3>I Fear Wu Ji</h3>
<p>— Lan Lan</p>
<p>Under many oppressions and many scruples, the theater circle on the isolated island is feeling a script panic. We have seen Mr. Yu Ling's new work "Night Shanghai." How can it not make people excited?</p>
<p>I am honored to have played Pei Pei in "Women's Apartment" and Mi Mi in "Tears on Flowers," and now I am going to play Wu Ji in "Night Shanghai." It so happens that in the same period, I am filming "Women's Apartment," directing "Tears on Flowers," and performing "Night Shanghai." Among these three scripts, the role of Pei Pei is more annoying. She only knows how to compete for jealousy and intrigue all day long, planning how to win a better and more comfortable life to be a more outstanding parasite. Such a woman is too insulting to many outstanding women! Mi Mi is more pitiful. She wants to struggle, wants to go upwards. She is not guilty herself, but the road that society shows her is an abyss. Under the abuse of her stepmother, the oppression of society, and the seduction of men, she ends up taking the road of suicide. As for Wu Ji in "Night Shanghai," I think she is lovely and worthy of sympathy. The author has carved her so deeply and so prominently. She is not a special person. Among the four thousand or so dance girls in Shanghai, she is also one of them. Her life is like the one surrounding us, and it is also a typical example of the urban women's lives that we are familiar with. We can hear it, see it, and imagine it. Her life experience exceeds that of the four dance girls in "Tears on Flowers." She has encountered abuse, suffered bullying, and life may have forced her to commit suicide, to be dissolute, to be promiscuous, to be deceived; all the unfortunate dance girls have tried, and the tragic stories all appear in her life attitude in the play. The tragic experience has numbed her whole person. She only uses "dance" as her livelihood. In order to live, she advises Yun Gu—this lonely and helpless little girl—to become a prostitute for the sake of her mother's illness and to prevent her siblings from being driven out to sleep on the streets. She also teaches Feng Feng—this outstanding student of fine arts—to dance. Yes, she is doing this on purpose.</p>
<p>Dear audience, I don't want to deceive you. When I was rehearsing this role, under the detailed analysis and instructions of director Zhu Duanjun, I feared Wu Ji. I feared her so much that I felt cold. I wanted to shout silently, I wanted to cry without tears. I was dazed and silly. There was always a large and heavy object lying in my chest. This kind of "inner" role, this life in the superficial layer is too tragic.</p>
<p>Dear audience, I also want to tell you that our group, a group who loves theater, has decided on this long-term performance in order to unite more strongly and work more intensely. Our first meeting gift must not be bad, yes, we must not let it fail. Because in the past there were audiences who cared about us and friends who encouraged us, so we rely on this reliable strength, as the director said, we will study, think, work hard, and rehearse without sleep or food. But we also want to ask for more. Dear audience, dear friends, give us more and more serious love and criticism, let us join hands and spur on and alert the playwright and director's hard work, so that the stage can shine and drive away the darkness of society.</p>
