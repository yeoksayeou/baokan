<p>蘇聯人民委員會主席兼外交委員長莫洛托夫，於十月卅一日，在蘇聯最高會議第五决全體臨時大會席上，報告目前之國際形勢，以及「蘇聯外交政策之原則」，辭詳昨報。其量之豐。其質之重，為近年各國當局關於國際問題之演說中所罕見。讀其言辭而瞻望方來，必深感於「蘇聯之意念行動誠最不可捉摸；」然蘇聯在最近七旬間之種種作為，既經刻鏤於世人心頭眼底者，今復經彼當局作此綜合演說，乃無殊於更經良工攝影，得一異常明晰之「拷員；」眞面目宛然，關心世變史實者可得而諦視焉。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫之言，饒有注意價值。價值不在眞理，蓋如此云云並未包涵何種眞理，亦任何眞理之中殆亦並無如此云云；其價值在國際。蘇聯賢哲對於國際貢獻甚多：遠如列寗氏發揚共產主義，世之勞苦大衆嚮往焉；近如李維諾夫氏詮註侵略定義，世之弱小民族嚮往焉；凡此嚮往，皆超越國界，蔚為洪流，頗為國際所崇信。今莫洛托夫之言，其性質逈異於列寗李維諾夫二氏所貢獻，而所關國際者亦大。蓋往日國際對於蘇聯，有絕不相侔之認識，其間至少有兩種認識實為「嚴重錯誤：」其一，誤認蘇聯政策以超越國界之是非為基礎，今由莫洛托夫之說明而得糾正；即蘇聯之政策，以蘇聯國家為本位，為蘇聯國家之「權利」與「安全」計，其政策乃超越國界而伸其「義務」與「門戶」以及「軍事根據地」於他國國界之內；此種政策，蓋與所謂是非也者，風馬牛不相及者也，其二，誤認共產主義為超越一切之金科玉律，今亦由莫洛托夫之說明而得糾正；即「希特勒主義之思想，正與任何思想相同」，當然，共產主義之思想亦為任何主義思想之一，亦非超越一切之金科玉律，而僅僅為「各人政治立塲之問題」；金科玉律則莊嚴神聖，至尊無對，政治立塲則容許伸縮，容許妥協，蓋相對者也。此兩種誤認，蔚為國際洪流者相當之久助廣，莫洛托夫紀正之。故曰其言之價值在國際。</p>
<p>由莫洛托夫之言，可以深信蘇聯在過去七旬間實以和平為本；雖在波蘭境內，在「波蘭瓦解後一，「與波軍發生大戰」，和平政策下之蘇聯紅軍亦死傷二千六百人，然以略地十九萬六千方公里之廣，人口一千三百萬之衆，則彼二千六百人所流者亦可謂和平之血矣：若彼波羅的海三小國者尤能於其尙未瓦解之際，以和平態度，接受蘇聯之和平政策；此誠蘇聯偉大之成功，是為莫洛托夫所欣欣樂道者也。</p>
<p>『蘇聯之意念行動，誠不可捉摸』者也，雖莫洛托夫再三反覆聲明『蘇聯必繼續一貫推行和平外交政策』。似乎其意念和平行動和平可以昭著天下而無待捉摸矣；何况莫洛托夫所聲明蘇聯逢此危險之戰局，『置身局外』，云云，固與吾人往日推論蘇聯以觀戰為其基本政策，若合符節；持續和平，詎有疑義？然有未可一概論者，彼於芬蘭事，有語日『蘇聯惟有採取嚴厲辦法，藉以保障安全』，『芬蘭政府應接受吾人之建議，查吾人之建議為最低限度之辦法」；彼於土耳其事，則有語曰「將來土耳其是吾不後悔，吾人將不加預測」；循彼所語，猶霍霍磨刀，為問和平之必然性安在？不僅為此而已，世人不猶憶蘇聯與日本簽訂邊界停止敵對協定之翌日，翹然進兵波蘭乎？今莫洛托夫之演說歐洲糾紛，顧乃獨對日本遙作接吻之姿態，如此魔住日本，安知復非有為於歐洲之朕兆乎？抑磨刀或割或不割，朕兆或應或不應，操縱在彼，固猶未可捉摸者也。</p>
<p>世人於飫聞莫洛托夫演說之後，頗有人焉，若有所失，謂何以竟無一語及於中國？遠如歐美，近而上海，交相質疑。吾人則有深信不疑者：蘇聯目前之政策，顯然以其國家之權利與安全為本位，前又既言之矣，是惟中國强大，始無損於亞洲蘇聯之權利與安全，而絕無遭受任何威脅之虞，故蘇聯對中國必維持其善意，此一也。蘇聯目前之外交，亦即莫洛托夫演說之日之蘇聯外交，除蘇聯本國有關之外交問題而外，要在乎盡其一切和平方法以應援德國；無論抨擊英法，譏刺美國，恐嚇土耳其，乃至示好於日本。皆為德國；予德國以經濟上之方便接濟，為德國作外交上之縱橫捭園，代德國謀歷史上之翻案，代德國覓理論上之根據，無所不用其極；有所不為者，不為德國流血；若流血，亦不為德國而為蘇聯本國；雖如莫洛托夫之演說，亦謂為完全為德國可也；此其二也。語不及中國，因中國自始無負於德國；亦因異於日本，蓋中國不欲作態於英德之間！</p>

<p>華盛頓　衆院今日辯論中立案時、民主黨麥考瑪克因蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在蘇聯國會演說時抨擊美總統羅斯福、要求召回駐蘇大使、謂蘇聯外長發此種批評、意欲左右美國輿論、實為破壞國際公法之舉動云、至是激昂辯論因以發生、共和黨衆議員費許反對此項要求、謂麥考瑪克之議論、極有戰爭氣味、為一九一七年美國宣戰後所未有云、麥考瑪克答稱、吾輩為美國人民理應置其國家於小助反對上帝派而助基督敎與民治主義派之地位云、共和黨巴頓稱、軍火禁令之保存、可助歐戰早日了結、如廢止禁令則將成歷史中眞正戰爭因以發作之表徵、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　麻省民主黨衆議員麥考瑪克昨於衆院會議中演說、對莫洛托夫之演說大加攻擊、謂莫氏演詞中批評美國中立法修正案之舉、實乃違反國際公法、並建議政府召回駐蘇美大使、麥氏繼稱「禁運軍火條款不取消、即屬間接援助蘇德」依華瓦民主黨衆議員依柴克演說擁護行政當局之中立法案、亦提及莫洛托夫之演說、稱莫洛托夫為「希特勒之右手、彼之所以對余等攻擊、乃因余等並未為彼等所欲為者、」紐的共和黨衆議員費許則對麥考瑪克之演說、加以攻擊、稱為「一九一七年以來煽動戰爭最烈之演說、」（二日美聯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　白宮秘書歐爾利、頃向報界發表談話稱、蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、曾就羅斯福總統對於芬蘭與蘇聯談判所採態度、加以批評、此事發生於美國衆議員行將表決中立法修正案之時、良非「偶然」、演詞全文、羅期福總統曾吾閱悉、不得而知、但余個人則會在報端閱悉數段、「不禁以莫洛托夫所表示之見解、是吾偶然巧合為問、蘇聯與芬蘭兩國談判、在最近三星期以還、迄在極端秘密中進行、莫洛托夫乃於此際揭發雙方所討論之問題、此層實值得注意、赫爾國務卿亦向報界發表談話云、莫洛托夫之演詞、不必加以評論、特有不能已於言者、即任何友邦、為維持和平計、向其他各國出面斡旋、事屬正當、固一般人所公認者也、此外衆議院本日開會時、民主黨議員麥考瑪克會發表演說謂莫洛托夫之演詞、乃係干涉美國中立法修正案討論之一種「手段」、美國政府對於莫洛托夫批評羅斯福總統之舉、宜召回駐蘇大使、以示抗議云、各衆議院聞言、莫不熱烈鼓掌甚久、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統前於本年四月十四日電逮德國元首希特勒、義國首相墨索里尼、呼籲和平之後、蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寗、會來電表示欽仰之意、頃由白宮予以發表、略謂「貴大總統登高一呼、各民族凡誠摯願望維持世界和平者、莫不熱烈響應、」按自蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫發表演說、指責羅期福總統干頂蘇聯芬蘭兩國談判之後、此乃羅期福總統所作唯一正式答覆、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>紐約　蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫在其演詞中指摘美國不以自由權給予古巴國與菲律濱羣島之後、紐約泰唔士報頃加以評論「古巴國前此曾因財政理由、聽任美國過問該國之事、茲該國已成為完全自由的獨立國家五年於茲矣、至以菲律濱羣島而論、亦當於一九四六年實行獨立、凡此即古巴國與菲律濱曁美國之小學生、亦均知之、他人倘以此種事件告之、實即以侮辱加諸彼等之智慧、莫洛托夫之知識乃謭陋若是、殊難令人置信、」（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>關於蘇聯態度　各國輿論一斑　德國流露失望情緒　日本提出幾點希望</h3>
<p>柏林　蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫發表演說之後、德國官方極為失望、此層各中立國觀察家均巳見及之、但德國各橄尙欲加以掩飾、仍稱蘇聯為「世界最進步的國家、」民衆觀察報聊以一文解嘲、略謂、「英法兩國倘欲將現行局部戰爭擴大為第二次世界大戰、蘇聯政府定常以全力反抗之、莫洛托夫昨日發表演說時、業巳忠實的說明意見、此公未向蘇聯各友邦提出空洞的諾言、但對於各國之甘受外力引誘者、則嚴詞加以警告、總之、任何人凡欲在蘇聯勢力範圍之內攻擊德國者、均非蘇聯所許、一種保障、不僅以波羅的海沿岸為限、抑且推及於黑海方面、」此外、某某報亦載稱、「德國能以强大的蘇聯為庇蔭」云、此其所言、反足以映德國當局之不安心理、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　此間政界人士、以為莫洛托夫之演說、未能證實樂觀之希望、或恐怖之預言、渠等以為此項演詞、全係中立語調、而第一部分之論據、與德國之論據、頗為相似、可視為蘇聯與德國之精神團結之宣言、另一方面、蘇聯雖保持中立、仍支持德國之和平努力、蘇聯之重要地位、業巳證實、因英法兩國、經數月之談判、未能與蘇聯締結同盟關係、且目前蘇聯之地位、不能視為對英法兩國、表示友好態度、而英法兩國、仍不仇視蘇聯、羅馬尼亞人士、以為莫洛托夫雖抨擊民主國家、然蘇聯已處於優越之政治地位、國聯大會於十二月間開會時、蘇聯或將在日內瓦採取和平攻勢、亦未可知、（二日海通電）</p>
<p>東京　日本各報對於莫洛托夫蘇日重行修好之提議、皆表歡迎、惟須以蘇聯修正其遠東政策並斷絕與蔣介石將軍之關係為條件、朝日新聞謂蘇聯如有誠意、則蘇日物物交換協定之締結必屬可能、國民新聞則頂料萬一默洲議和、則日本將有充分理由恐懼央美在華之干預、日本輿論、皆贊成與德義有更密切之連繫而蘇聯亦加入其間云、廣知報評述莫洛托夫之演說云、邊境糾紛之解決及貿易交換之布置、雖均有益於兩國關係之改善、惟尙不能稱之為重大、兩國關係重大改善之先決條件、顯然為蘇聯勢力之退出中國、及終止援助蔣介石政權、莫氏此决演說中之完全未提及中國、果能認為蘇聯政府巳準備對於遠東與日本成立一種政治協定乎、就莫氏演詞表面觀之、則似頗有改善蘇日關係之意嚮、滿邊之衝突、漁業條的之糾紛、及一九三一年以來兩國間因種種細故而引起之惡感、或將從此消滅、野村外相亦曾於十月二十一日宣布其調整日蘇關係之政策云、讀賣新聞載稱、日本對蘇聯之地位、與英法兩國所處者不同、英法亟欲獲得蘇聯之合作、以遏制德國之勢力、但日本之地位、即使無蘇聯之支持、亦可實施其本身之政策、况日本與蘇聯間更有主義上之界域、故日本必須堅持其反共政策（二日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　泰晤士報今日著論評述蘇外長莫洛托夫最近之演說、謂柏林力面對莫氏演說、期待甚殷、今見其如此措詞、必大為失望、因其演詞中之唯一眞正決定、即為蘇聯將繼續保持中立也、莫氏對於蘇聯與日本與土耳其之關係、雖少提及、惟聞蘇土自最近談判破裂以來、仍維持好感、談判即將賡續舉行、倘使兩國均志在鞏固巴爾幹各國之團結、則彼此利益、似不難臻於調和、然共產主義係一種破裂性之勢力、再附以大斯拉夫主義、似未必能促成東南歐之團結、莫氏演辭中最誠實之言論、似為說明蘇聯未來之目的、即對於國際事務將放手做去、（二日路透社電）</p>

<h3>中國抗戰決心　不受國際影響　顏惠慶在美發表談話</h3>
<p>華盛頓據中國前駐蘇聯大使現充中國出席太平洋國交大會首席代表之顏惠慶博士、今日對美聯社記者言、渠不信世界各國之新陣容、如蘇德之合作、及英洛托夫所稱之蘇日妥協、能影響中國對日抗戰之地位、中國決計繼續抗戰、直至日本軍閥覺悟其中國之不可征服而後止、記者叩以有無被任為中國駐美大使或其他各國大使之可能性、顏氏答稱、渠在美蘇兩國前此曾膺使節之命、至於渠今後之計劃、在以餘年從事於私人工作及半官性之工作、如今决在太平洋國交大會中所担任之工作、又謂、目前之國際局勢、殊為混雜、故欲將歐局之發展作詳細之說明及闡明其對于遠東之影響、事實上極為難能、但渠信蘇聯之行動、無論如何、不致影響中國之抗戰、並謂蘇日若眞能為和平而努力、則中國對于蘇日之接近、將歡迎之不暇、顏博士又調、渠擬訪問國務卿赫爾、或更將晋謁羅斯福總統、但除表示敬意外別無其他意義、同時渠在逗留此間之時期中、其唯一任務為出席太平洋國交大會、談用菲列賓問題、顏氏聲稱、菲人多望美國不入棄菲列賓、又謂、渠在孟買會小作勾留、見印人對蘇聯之侵略波蘭、印象頗不佳、因而印度對蘇聯之同情喪失不少、故渠意蘇聯欲在印度擴展勢力勢巳難能、談及美國中立法問題、顏氏稱、中國方面對此頗感不安、中國所需要者、即欲美國切實斷絕軍火對於侵略國之供給、中國目前之抗戰、乃為獨立而戰、為生存而戰、為正義而戰、惟中國對于民主國尤其美國之同情、極表感謝、希望美國之同情、能早日轉為具體之援助、（二日美聯電）</p>
<h3>英日談判　擱淺原因　癥結在存銀問題</h3>
<p>倫敦　據日方可靠方面消息、上星期中英日談判之所以復歸於擱淺、原因仍在天津英租界之中國存銀問題、上星期英國駐日大使克萊琪與日本外次谷正之繼續談判時、谷正之堅主將中國政府存於天津英租界交通銀行中之一千四百萬白銀交出、否則拒絕討論天津問題之解決、谷正之並謂、此款乃用以救濟華北水災者、但據英國以外在華有利益關係之第三國外交界觀察、日本似圖逼迫英德二國放棄天津之租界、至於上海之公共租界、因與美國及共他國家有關、故日方對之、必將採取較審愼之行動、（二日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　泰晤士報外交訪員探悉、因日軍佔據中國數省土地而引起之英日各問題之談判、目前仍在懸擱中、日政府顯待注精衛之政權切實成立、蓋寄共希望於此也、惟該政權一時似尙不能實現、因日本軍部領袖對於汪氏欲將華北列入新政權所轄之範圍、皆予反對也、在氏除不欲檳於華北之外、且要求財政獨立權、此亦傅翼在氏者所不欲給予者、至於國民政府方面、對於最近之軍事勝利、似不無煊染過甚、然其抗戰精神依然甚壯、實無疑問、再日本因戰爭所受之重大金融担負、卒未稍鬆、此亦值得注意者也、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲（續）</h3>
<p>— 倫敦特約通信　叔棣</p>
<p>所以，問題的焦點，就是在：怎樣可以很快地，解決一百五十萬左右的波蘭軍力？</p>
<p>德國相信自己可以在短期間內解決波蘭軍力麽，照近些時我們由德國自己一些出版物上口吻推斷，大概牠是相信的。據這些作者的意見，戰爭一開始，就側重於戰略的獲勝，而不斤斤於某一地區，某一戰役，以期短期內就決定成敗的大局，使波蘭長期抗戰為不可能。照這幾天以來的實際戰事進展看，德國是循着這個途徑的；不過能吾未來如德國預期，還等事實去証明。</p>
<p>在這個階段內，德國最擔心着的事，一共有兩件：一是意大利的突然被英·法·拉去，二是波蘭內部政治機構變更，和蘇聯携手。這是兩個渺遙的危機，在目前，當然是完全不可能。不過，萬一德·波·戰曠日持久下去的話，那末，這却漸漸有變成可能的危險。因為如此，德國就不得不更下最大決心和用最大力量，很快解決波蘭。</p>
<p>萬一德國果然解決了波蘭，而且很快地。那末，接着而起的，牠的企圖是什麼呢？毫無疑問的，在西方，醞釀與英·法·停戰；在東方，掠取了波蘭所有的器械原料存品後，再併呑牠西部上西利西亞的一帶工業區。至於與蘇俄之間，則仍然保留着一條緩衝地帶。</p>
<p>這個階段，可以給予一個名字，那是：「戰波而勝」。</p>
<p>戰波而勝了之後，萬一英·法·還是拒絕和平，那末，德國外交，又算再敗一次。而放在德國面前的問題，就又進一步擴大起來，嚴重起來了。這一形勢的實現，以英·法，目前當局者們的手腕和氣魄來看，大概是十分可能的。如果這樣，那末，希特拉還要向下面，再做他的文章。</p>
<p>希特拉是頂見到這一層的，所以，他也在準備下了他的對策。</p>
<p>這個對策的第一點，毫無疑問的，是利用了英·法·海軍國與陸軍國任務的小同，向法國盡量要好，一面烔之以法國對德陸戰的無望，一面，又勸之以德國對法的毫無野心。這樣一來，他計算着，可以動搖法國的戰意，鬆懈了英·法·的團結。在同時，却向英國進行秘密外交，帮助反動份子的外交復活。</p>
<p>如果和平醞釀失敗，那末，勢必須再繼續着的「戰爭」。</p>
<p>在這時對英·法·的戰爭裹，如果英·法·攻擊不很嚴重，那末，德國一面是採取守勢，閉門建造海軍，將來再出來與英·法·在海上決一雌雄；另一面，就加緊在東南歐·及近東·非洲·等地的活動。德國計算着，這樣拖下去，首先呌起苦來的，一定是英·法。而不是德國。戈林曾說過：「英法一切，用的是錢；德國呢，却祇是人工。」誠然，像英·法·目前動員狀况下，大規模的消耗，實在是，萬難毫無用意，祇是為了保持戰爭的局面，而長久存在下去的。這一點，德國式的戰時與平時沒有什麼大區別的國家，就佔了莫大的便宜。</p>
<p>萬一英·法·的攻勢嚴重呢。（希特拉算着是不會的）那末，德國大概也許會還手；可是有一個大前提，那就是意大利與西班牙的參戰，同時，就做出與蘇聯進一步携手的姿勢。眞是那樣，那情勢就格外非常嚴重了。</p>
<p>那樣，一到了某一時機，美國一定而且必須參戰。在美國參戰塲合下，希特拉最後一張牌，就是，乾脆與蘇聯眞正携手。</p>
<p>希特拉於對波用兵的前夜，會以激越的調子，在吼着：「我告訴你們：德國絕不會再簽訂第二個『凡爾賽和約！』」</p>
<p>這些天來，我們由各方面德國舉措來看，大概，那卞面一句沒有說出的註解，現在，却逐漸說出來了，那是；「德國奪願赤化。」</p>
<p>德國「赤化」也者，在目前，自然是一句頗為好笑的話。然而，萬一在德國被英·法·等國戰到將敗的時候，這一句話，却會馬上變成了事實。</p>
<p>社會主義國家的蘇聯後，再加上一個社會主義國家的德國，那時的歐洲局面，是不靴想像的。這，就使得道一般資本帝國主義國家的當軸者們，不得不在對德採取重大計劃時，多皺上幾回眉頭，而陷入了深深的思索！</p>
<p>這麽樣，一轉來，希特拉又在英·法·的當局面前，放下了一個大大的難題！</p>
<p>希特拉這一次從事波蘭冒險時，他的懷抱和決意，是這麼樣的徹頭徹尾。這裏述的，僅僅是一個輪廓而已。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　港帮賣出最力　匯市盤旋帶鬆</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市趨勢鬆懈、情況平凡、人心恬淡、觀望者多、但港帮仍在猛塞、惟賣買之間、絕無重大反應、全日經過、初開均平、經港電首來吐售、旋投機商亦出先令、再以美行大通供意濃厚、價即長至五辦士一五六二五、及八元五九三七五、惟上日拋塞之猶太商喬直甫、突來獲利補進後、一度回軟、英金銀行賣價即退至五辦士〇九三七五、及美匯八元半、後以港電復吐、同時日行住友塞出、故又回硬、自此直鬆至五辦士二一八七五及八元六八七五、而為晚收價、且屬最硬行情、中途仍以港電曁美行另賣、紗花帮則吸入若干、論期貨交易、已漸見軋攏、且不乏人做開、全天交易稍淸、</p>
<p>喬直甫獲利補空</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近平遠長一二五、紐約銀價未更、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法仍平、對滬降〇六二五、美對英升一二五、對滬大五分、對法小一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士〇六二五、美匯八元四三七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後港電前來塞出、兼投機商亦吐售先令、加之美行大通等均懷供意、致市勢步鬆、計港電與投機商塞予外行現貨英金五辦士一〇九三七五、與一五六二五、繼而港電又與大通某行售予外行有利及華商現貨美匯八元半、與五九三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後猶太商喬直甫突獲利補空、是以情况一度回軟、計喬直甫購進外行本月份英金五辦士一二五、後現貨賣價、外行曾喊緊至五辦士〇九三七五及八元半、旋以港電復來吐塞、且日行正金住友亦前來拋出、故情勢重見步硬、計港電吐予匯豐有利等外行現貨英金五辦士一五六二五及一八七五、並日行賣予外行現貨美匯八元五六二五與六二五、時巳正午、午收銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士一五六二五、美匯八元五九三七五、比晨開英鬆〇九三七五、美硬一五六二五、</p>
<p>美日商拋塞不已</p>
<p>後市港電續有拋出、兼美行亦仍懊供意、雖紗花帮稍有納胃、但頭寸仍感充裕、致狀態續吿步硬、計港電與美行相繼吐予紗花帮及外銀行現貨英金五辦士一八七五與二一八七五、並現貨美匯八元六二五與六八七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣產價、英金五辦士二八七五、美國八元六八七五、本月份英金五辦士二〇三一二五、美匯八元六五六二五、結果比上日現貨英鬆一五六二五、美硬二五、本月份英長一七一八七五、美賤二八一二五、</p>
<p>香港美滙略見鬆</p>
<p>香港二日電、今晨匯市開盤平平、英日申各匯不動、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為二十五元、十時四十分申匯現貨降五元、為二百八十六元、十時五十分、申匯現貨續降二元、為二百八十四元、午收申匯現貨回升四元、為二百八十八元、下午二時三十分開盤、平穩不動、</p>
<p>天津英金五便士</p>
<p>天津二日電、今日匯市晨開穩定、英匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為五便士、美匯現貨長一二五、為八元二五、申匯降一元、為一百〇二元、「聯鈔」暗盤亦賤一元、為九十二元半、</p>
<h3>金市不堪回首　香港帮雖在逢小吃進　其如多方趁高拋出何</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續告慘落、不堪回首、蓋市塲因缺乏利多消息故也、反之賣空者十九獲利、且聞天津金價與本市比較、巳超過輸送之點、相差達三百元光景之巨、故日來津商等陸續携金來滬出售、為數自當可觀、故籌碼無形增加、雖港帮不時逢小吸進、頭寸終仍富裕、更以散多趁高必出、而外匯每報鬆硬、市價實難支撑一時、晨開暴跌三十元、為三千六百六十元、嗣以港帮吃胃頗佳、而散戶亦有扒進、故曾回起二十元、但證券帮等見機即出而撳小、後受匯市一度報軟、人心始不免一振、拉高達三千六百八十五元、惟迄下午曾見最低價三千六百四十元、收盤尙為三千六百四十叫元、此因外匯復鬆故也、全天交易尙旺、的一千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>再跌四十六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開局勢依然散漫無勁、旋聞外匯步硬、人氣更餒、某金號代投機商首先撳價賣出、開市竟猛落三十元、金號售予某銀樓五十兩、為三千六百六十元、少頃港帮趁低拖進同時散戶亦接踵收買、回升二十元、錢兌業進金號十兩、為三千六百八十元、嗣因證券帮乘機出籠、且以外匯仍趨疲境、價又不支下落、證券帮吐予某銀樓三十兩、為三千六百五十二元時外匯忽橄回軟、人心一振、市勢頓為之一轉、某錢兌業力吸二百餘兩、回起三十三元、錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、為三千六百八十五元、此後匯市復趨鬆動、散戶賣風又起、兼銀樓帮套賣亦殷、市况重向下降未幾步落二十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、為三千六百六十五元、作午收價、午後初開頗穩、首先證券帮互做三十兩、為三千六百六十八元、嗣因某金號代客吐出、步小十三元、錢兌業進某銀號二十兩、為三千六百五十五元、時某證券帮空頭獲利補進、拉起十二元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、為三千六百六十七元、入後終因外匯步硬、進者轉少、加之銀樓帮及某金號等互相拋塞、竟降落二十七元、錢兌業售予證券帮十兩、為三千六百四十元、近收盤時某銀樓塌便宜買進、拉起四元、某銀樓進同業二十兩、為三千六百四十四元作晚收價、結果比上日續降四十六元、全天四十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十五元、迨至十時十八分掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸三百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進的减低十五元之譜、</p>
<h3>外幣市價日非</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外滙供給趨盛烚赤軟弱、英美金鎊、需要甚稀、英美金票供給甚暢、逐步下降、美金票晚市降達十一元六角、香港票因港匯供給頗盛、跟隨下降、新加坡·荷蘭票·供給較增、坎拿大·斐律賓票步美金票鬆降、日金票先疲後回、晚市為一元三角零五厘、朝鮮需要蛟殷、晚市為一元一角、昨日市價、英美金鎊、俱降一元、英金要降一元二角、美金票降三角二分、香港票降五分、法郞票降五厘、新加坡荷蘭坎拿大斐律賓等票俱降一角、共他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現再小</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、盤低不巳、每千元初仍三十九元光景、後即步低至三十五元、近午始見回上、為三十七元半、下午呆站原價、仍三十七元半、再軋小一元五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍掛一角五分未更云、</p>
<h3>證券　中法債劵飛漲九鎊　內債市況免起鶻落　外股收買有增無減</h3>
<p>倫敦一日電、今日中國外債掛脾行市、續告猛漲、上檔漲起三鎊至九鎊、下檔亦升一鎊至三鎊、上檔之中法美金在跳九鎊、價為叫十四鎊、善後（英發）漲穴鎊、價為三十五鎊、英德續（英發）及英法（英發）各漲五鎊、前者為四十七鎊、後者為三十八鎊、費克斯飛機漲四鎊、為士二鎊、克利斯浦漲三鎊、為二十三鎊、下檔之鐵路公債除津浦各債仍告平穩外、計廣九及北寗各漲三鎊、前者為十三鎊、後者為五十鎊、隴海漲三鎊為十二鎊、其餘各漲一鎊、均為十三鎊、總觀各債、上檔之關稅及庚款擔保債券、漲風最烈、鹽稅債券决之、鐵路債又次之、</p>
<p>證券暗盤昨日市況、頗有免起鶻落之狀、但其變幻、幷非因遭外界不利空氣之襲擊、僅以多方已失去聯絡、適為空方所乘、倫敦國外公債、又告大漲、續高五至九磅之巨、致使人心閃爍浮沉、在此醞釀期內、債市盤旋、自不能免、唯其趨勢、當仍為曲綫上騰耳、昨日經過、午前因鴻康順康等繼續收買、初開曾抬高六七角、戊種父復接近五十元關、祇以散戶多頭、乘機紛紛出籠、市價乃逐步下降、丙種再退近九元大關、同順等亦頗有賣出、午後形勢尤覺軟弱、大通茂泰以及散戶等陸續賣出、市仍因吃戶太少、逐步下瀉、丙種復進九元關、人心虛弱、完全基於多空之傾軋、市價結果、回小三角至四角半、成交總數、約共六七十萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>衆業公所報告　昨日股市、潛勢鎮日堅强、有數種價格發現新高峯、晨初有不少浮多斬結、但下午開盤、因新賬登塲、在大衆購買在潮下、各股升達頂點、俟因獲利者競相出籠、收盤時價格微落、但趨勢仍極堅昂、各信託公司股及瑞鎔股最惹人注意、橡皮股興趣亦較濃厚、蘭格志股開二十五元之高紀錄、</p>
<p>倫敦一日電、今日遠東英商各公司、股票掛牌行市、亦告堅漲、麥加利銀行股漲五先令、價為八鎊正、匯豐銀行香港註冊股漲三鎊、英倫註冊股、漲五鎊、價均為八十二鎊、有利銀行股漲五先令、價為十一鎊五先令、開平煤礦不記名股再升一先令、價為十七先令、古拉客林傍橡皮股升一先令三便士、價為十七先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市看穩　集會塲所聞將另遷</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、處在水平綫上盤旋、全日之上下、僅在五元之間、目前市塲多數心理看有好面、因廣帮停滯巳久、雖無巨量交易發展、但零碎生意續而不斷、因此看穩一步、又有一說、謂各廠存積已久、現貨漸增、頗有開售之意、然在此軟硬不一之市面中、殊難措置、匯票亦在徘徊之途、就以上情况論之、大有進退維谷之間、深恐有長期間之兜圈子、但一部份手貨因虧耗太鉅、不願犧牲斬結、市况擯持一步、</p>
<p>現紗晨開香港帮意態開散、尚無辦貨模樣、開價跌五元、二十支雙馬為六百五十元、旋以同業心思看堅、稍有買者、又復回升幾元至六百五十五元、中途升降一二元之間、趨勢甚平、查半日間成交統計一千三百三十七包、行情二十支雙馬平、與上日無甚軒輊、惟天女漲六元、雙地球漲四元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城五十包、價為六百五十八元、昨出口紗有七百八十五件運天津、一百八十二件運烟台、今日尙有一百十五件運香港、二十六件運西貢、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港三八五　同行四八〇　廈門六五</p>
<p>江西　七〇　福州　二　內地六二</p>
<p>溫州　二五　統計一·三三七</p>
<p>另訊紗業公會集會塲所新址、搬在大馬路跑馬廳新世界二層東樓以後、客帮及一部份同業因地段旣不相宜、而又無電話以通消息、與外界呼應不靈、因此不願參加、於此分離變成兩個集會點、自經某某等鑒於如斯情形、不是根本辦法、茲聞巳竭力設法另起爐灶、大約再招尋在北京路寗波路同和里前敦餘錢莊之店址、該處房價殊昂、對於各同業增加會費、以資彌補、前途如無變卦、不日當可成事實云、</p>
<h3>棉花無甚榮辱</h3>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因滙兌鬆長、各方均抱觀望、昨日起市况巳略見鬆動、同業間以滬上細紗存底稀薄、故已有開始訂購者、日廠商亦略有動辦、俱為即裝者、今後美棉交易或有轉機之可能也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初因利物浦來電良好、故棉市殊為堅定、後因美政府審計院對於現行之棉業貸款及過剩棉花之處置、有表示不滿之說、因之引起大衆賣出、市况頓時呈現疲乏之狀、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落十餘磅音、印度棉市、因反對兩省長之辭職、雖開盤營業、而無市價、埃及漲三五磅音、利物浦收盤時回落三便士、</p>
<h3>本埠印棉商　抵制林白里棉</h3>
<p>英文大英晚報最近載有本埠全體印棉商、抵制林白里來棉、按林白里為印度一小城、年產大量棉花、運銷全印各地、近因統領之子、達達塞海及加加塞海、搶刦婦女、致引起公憤、全印各棉織商及出口商、皆起而抵制云、林白里當局現正改法至香港承銷、但巳受港印棉商反對、即日本各棉商亦抵制此棉、據確悉、茲有五百三十二包林白里棉、將於本月十號抵滬、本埠各印棉商巳設法抵制云、</p>
<p>本棉交易尚堪維持、但大景成交、仍見缺乏、故人心無甚榮辱可分、日商內外廠進白包打包花十件、其他廠家絕少生氣、華廠隻包未嘗採辦、至於同業中買賣益覺澗滯、所以棉市亦趨呆定、須待紗市轉昂當有進展之望也、蘇北來源、到通州花一千一百八十包、常陰沙七百包、北沙來五百四十包、今日二百〇五包運香港、二十六包運暹羅、茲將現棉售開之盤列左，</p>
<p>通州花　一三〇·〇〇　一三一·〇〇　同業進　八〇〇包　鈔票棧交</p>
<p>火機花　一二一·五〇　一二二·〇〇　又　六〇〇包　又　又</p>
<p>常陰沙打包　一三七·〇〇　內外廠進　一〇〇〇件　又　廠送</p>
<h3>糧食　粳秈一致回疲</h3>
<p>杜米市又呈徘徊局面、時盛時衰、倏忽不定、綠邇來國米處境異常複雜、祇若來源一項、無異操縱於某方、搬運出境、時則暢通、時則阻碍、運輸旣不自由、到貨遂難捉摸、兼之京蕪等區、巳入某方統制狀態、一般囤戶、從中漁利、巳難與昔日之穩堅景象可同日而語、所以市面常在變幻多端之中、以致無論零躉作客、一般穩健者常懷戒心、抱穩紮穩打之策、鮮肯冒險而存心思作用、昨本鄕店胃多屬應需添購、餘即袖手觀望而巳、早市開手形勢尙活絡、客販頗有喊高之聲、何如銷塲一動即懈、反現呆頓、懷貨者欲謀脫手、不得不隨風轉舵、讓價相邀、結果新粳及菉窖種百哥等新薄稻以銷滯貨夥、視前貶落二三角、破粳及陳新變元亦帶軟勢、全市來源共到蘇嘉太崑楓靑等貨二十餘車、統計成交數僅五六千包、</p>
<p>另訊（客秈）昨市雖有日商吐出、然內地鄕莊需要甚貪、內地帮辦去二千多包、因此市面初未受粳尖所影響、旋以日商拋售蕪秈外、兼有新粳蘆尖大量拋售、市價始被抑低一二角、（洋米）昨由達孚洋行經手售出太古棧存陳西貢一千五百包、價祇二十八元半、合市石祇二十三元、蓋被本客秈軋脚、致有此低價云、（粳米）昨到除常粳卸貨被阻絕跡外、其他各路均有點綴、初以常帮擯守居俏、旋由日商拋出崑山一帶新粳蘆尖六七千包、每包一石三斗、新粳祇二十六元至二十五元八角、蘆尖二十二元半至二十二元八角、由行號吸進、市面則被帶平矣、</p>
<h3>麥價又升二角　麺粉不易看小</h3>
<p>麵粉　南北兩帮均有零星指染、北洋帮除辦砲車兵船粉外、兼有採辦四五號粉、天竹粉南洋去化亦告聯蟬、各廠以原料價昂、售意仍堅、回籠貨供源寥寥、市面暗俏、二號粉本盤續開七元四角、客盤須七元五角至五角外、統市成交四萬餘包、脚地尙穩、一時不易看小云、</p>
<p>小麥　交易不旺、到銷兩少、因來源迭有阻撓、洋麥又難通劃、售手當然堅持、惟廠方以價高不欲多進、僅辦常錫等麥三千餘包、及囤戶拉進蘇州崑山滁州等麥五車、價為十一元五角至三角、又升二角左右、</p>
<p>進出口　昨有麵粉五百包運天津、五千包運塘沽、豆子有一千三百五十包運烟臺、而有三百五十包由北沙裝來、今日尙有粉三千包、豆子二千五百七十五包、生仁一百包、生油一百五十件運香港、三十件運暹羅、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球市價轉平</h3>
<p>煤球行情、自月前因原料斷檔、一再漲價、但日來鴻基屑絡繹有到、大批堆存、故人心穩定、價亦轉平、一般外行囤戶、亦紛紛出籠、棧單貨六十六元、同業送到、大廠貨每噸六十九元、客戶批發、酌加行扛、門莊零售、每祖（一百市斤）三元六七角不等、</p>

<p>夫婦失歡後的悲慘！　莫讓蟊賊似的暗疾，偷去了你們的前途和幸福！</p>
<p>有許多夫婦，在表面上看起來，和其他平常的夫婦，是沒有什麼異狀的。可是在服光銳利的人觀察之下，不論在他們面部的皺紋上或是言語行動的態度上，都可以看出他們有種隱憂深藏在內心中，隨時的在侵蝕着他們的身心，偷去了他們的靑春，陷入了人生的慘境！</p>
<p>照理，一對健康的夫婦，朝歡暮樂，浸潤在愛的氛圍裏，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，是不勝其幸福的！何以而有隱憂，而陷入悲境？這據醫學上的論斷，多數的原因在於男子早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，把生殖腺液消耗太過，則凡腦衰健忘，失眠亂夢，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，發育不全，未老先衰等症象叢生，此種病夫，雖有如花美眷，在愛的生活中恒表現着虛偽與無能，或竟完全不能人道，這怎能不引起妻子的憎恨呢？當秋雁南飛，眼看着一年老一年的時候，不特她的心中不勝其悲傷；就是做丈夫者一想到他是堂堂男子，為何要辜負她，成為愛情中的罪人時，滿眶酸淚，恐怕也要背了人在暗處落下吧！至於因夫婦失歡後而演出私奔，離婚，自殺，被殺等慘劇者，在今日社會上亦屬多不勝計！</p>
<p>無疑的夫婦的基礎是愛情，愛情的基礎是性健。聰明的男子必然深明此理。隨時的作增進健康之計。增進之法。據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為合算而可靠。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴猩猩海狗等體中提取的生殖腺精華用科學濃縮複製法製成。成分完全有效，品質無限貴重，服後於一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，尤貴連續服用，更可助長發育，滋養神經。無病者服之，短期內可增加體重，延年益壽，有上述症象者服之，必可計日根治各症，而返老還童。惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以制止遺洩，收效尤速！</p>
<p>患者任百明君，皖籍，年廿六，業商，早婚斵傷，致患腎虧腦弱，兼有遺精，婚後三年，從未生育，夫婦感情冰炭。於前月來本診所診治。經察知其病狀後，卽矚其在華美大藥房購服「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」使之兼服，月餘不間斷，幷施電療注射等新療法，果然恢復了美滿健康。夫婦愛情增厚，幷聞巳有夢熊之兆云。</p>
<h3>遺精症惡化後的療法　性病專科醫師詹念曾</h3>
<p>無病無癢的病症，往往是最厲害的病症。我們以靑年人的息遺精症而論卽可以證明。無智的靑年，因為好奇心的衝動，或為惡劣環境所引誘，往往犯有自凟惡癖，或早婚縱慾，要知道些不適當的性行為，最易斵傷性神經，使精關鬆弛，繼起着可怕的遺精症。可是無知的靑年，那裏知道遺精的可怕，或以遺精為無關痛癢，任其經年累月，或雖知遺精有害，而仍因循失治。弄到結果，症象惡化，由輕症的夢遺而成為重症的滑精漏精者有之；由精枯血竭爆發着腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，未老先衰等症者那更比比皆是。此種靑年如在學校求學，學業必一落千丈，或竟有不能升級與畢業之虞！如在工商界服務者，因精力不濟，大有不能勝任之苦，或竟致失業！欲談戀愛，因體貌不揚，每為女性所棄，陷入失戀慘境！如已結婚，夫婦更難諧魚水之歡，家庭間恒引起種種悲劇！遺精症惡化後的悽慘，簡直一言難盡！遺精症能早期治療，本屬易事，惟切不可亂服雜藥如「遺精片」之類，亦有貽誤病機的可能。若服以世界唯一治遺聖藥『希米脫氏固精片』。則卽可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，收安眠止遺之神效。如業巳惡化有上述症象者，除仍須積極服「希米脫氏固精片」外，更須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」（中西五洲等大藥房均售）以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育，連續服用，必能於短期因治愈各症，使身體益臻健康。惟患者如能親來本診所兼施電療注射等法，更可保證根治。</p>
<h3>健美　乳峯在冬季改造　纔是根本方法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>因為時序將近冬令，打開報紙來，觸入我們眼簾的，除國藥號的各種補品廣告外。西藥的補針，補丸，以及參燕號的官燕，銀耳等等亦復不少。此等補品，固然各有所長，我們未便討論，然我今日所要討論者，便是一向被人忽略，少見廣告，而在科學發達，醫學昌明下產生的婦女唯一特效補劑。</p>
<p>說到婦女補劑，或許有人要說：婦女補劑不也一樣充斥市塵，使人目迷五色嗎？此話固然。但我要問：婦女補劑中除了調和經血，振興食慾，廓淸白帶等一類藥品之外。尙有能調整體內各內分泌腺，發育乳峯，改造女性整個健美之專藥乎？有之，亦惟德國生理學大師斯丹那博士所發明之生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』蓋女性之所謂美不美？健不健？以及服補劑後的功效有沒有？都祇要看她的一對乳峯卽得。如乳峯高聳，乳頭挺綻，臀部丯腴，曲線明朗，則不但男子們要被他顚倒，出入交際，她好似一朶旣艷且香的花朶，人人希冀一親薌澤，感覺三生有幸。卽於健康方面，亦一望而知卵巢機能健全，新陳代謝作用旺盛。至於服藥後的功效如何？更可以萎瘟的乳峯，是否聳起為斷。此為歷來中外名醫所公認，要非信口雌黃可比。但服女用『生殖互』後咸能在短期內如願以償。蓋女用『生殖互』之成分，係男猛動物之卵巢素，腦下垂體，肝膏，膵臟，以及礦植物之燐，鈣，鐵等在紫光綫下精密煉製。故藥性異常和平，功效異常偉大。若於冬藏時期連續服之，不惟經血調和，面色紅潤，肌膚滑膩，不虞糙裂寒冷，且能使萎　的乳峯，日形高聳，一至來年春季，其隆然高聳之狀，有非筆墨所能形容才，此時服者驚奇，嘆為確係女界至實了。</p>

<h3>京滬沿線緊張後　日軍兵車絡繹</h3>
<p>客車「休息」日軍西行</p>
<p>滬杭路西塘日軍退卻</p>
<p>浦南遊擊區域恢復原狀</p>
<p>京滬鐵路沿途各處城鎮、在此二三天中、形勢異常緊張、蘇州無錫等處、連日發生沿途拉夫、前日（一日）由滬開寧之十二點四十分客車、臨時中止開出、懸掛粉牌、有「十三時四十分火車、今日休息、」字樣、因此謠言迭起、或雲沿鐵路特別戒嚴、或雲停開火車、交通將斷、</p>
<p>蘇搭乘蒸汽車返滬、車經唯亭真義昆山南翔等處車站、均有日軍讓過、由滬開出兵畫、計有四次之多、惟蒸汽車中之玻璃窗、由日憲兵登車、將車窗布拉下、不許乘客向窗外探望、車中乘客眾多、婦孺輩皆有恐慌現象、</p>
<p>沿路行人絕跡</p>
<p>滬郊莘莊梅隴等各鄉鎮、連日因日軍調防、實行戒嚴、檢查甚嚴、而鄉民行近鐵路線者、輒遭槍擊、故鐵路附近一帶小徑、人跡幾絕、冷寂異常、並聞前在冠生園農場內之便衣隊、其名稱日「民眾和平自衛團」人數約百余名、前日由陶某率領、與日憲佐隊繞鎮巡行、現在滬閔路口各要口佈崗護防、</p>
<p>追擊西塘日軍</p>
<p>滬杭鐵路楓涇車站日軍警備隊被華方正規軍圍　、並破壞鐵路洋橋兩座後、日軍破壞西塘鎮、茲據航業方面獲得續聞、盤踞西塘之日軍、經華軍第三十師部隊激戰後、將其逐回嘉興、沿路被華軍節節攔截、委棄屍體與武器甚夥、損失基重、</p>
<p>遊擊隊曾移動</p>
<p>浦南為邊擊隊策源地、前因偽「奉賢縣政務長」徐潮（即徐紫江）引領日軍佔南橋鎮藉已經伏法之偽「第三區綏靖副司令」李天民名義招致鹽梟地痞肆擾、故遊擊隊在過去三月、頗受其害、重以於陶生來滬、張范搖動、祇丁徐穀奚四部力搞、侷處海隅、大部且向滬杭路蘇嘉路移動、但現經第　戰區司令特拔舊獨立四十五旅全部（現擴充成師、計分三十三三十五三十七等三旅）與六十二師、先將乍浦及平湖（除城牆外）全部佔領、驅出日軍、直達浦南、軍令所及、張惠芳李文元許志飛張妙根部全受影響、日軍紛紛後撤、故浦東及上川路兩廊、上南路一帶、閔行對岸之杜行閘港塘口、遊擊隊已恢復原有勢力、</p>
<h3>日「恒產公司」圈了一般</h3>
<p>業主不加理會</p>
<p>掘土炸斃工人</p>
<p>日人投資創設之「上海恒產公司」、第一步著手經營地產事業、在閘北江灣一帶、任意圈用民地、建造房屋、以圖貿利、此種貿空買空之法術、積極推進、無數原有地主、均將先後喪失其產權、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>國用民地僅付債券</p>
<p>有名徐汀生者、在滬北某處置有基地四五畝、因地處　要、被恒產公司覬觀、將該地四週豎　圈用、即將興建房屋、徐聞悉後、輾轉設法投該公司交涉、不願出讓、詎恒產公司中日人課長平井、任意估定、總值地價五千三百六十四元四角、命徐先取零頭三百六十四元四角之現款、五千元則付一空頭不兌現之債券、徐憤極、對現款與債券均不受領、將其固有之地產權、委諸天命、</p>
<p>興建房屋炮　傷人</p>
<p>恒產公司又在市中心區「大道市府」附近、圈用某姓田地十餘畝、四週圍以籬笆、連日雇用小工多名、正在整理地面、以便動工建屋、前日中午、有小工三名、在該地泥潭內、掘出炮彈一枚、觸及機鈕、突然爆炸、轟然一聲、震動遠近、「大道市府」傳筱庵等一幹人、疑起禍變、莫不大起恐慌、直到查明原因、喘息方定、當炮彈炸發時、小工二名、當場炸斃、尚有一小工、炸去一腿、比經送至虹口日人所辦之福民醫院救治、延至昨晨亦氣絕斃命、</p>
<h3>歐洲休戰紀念　本年黯然無色</h3>
<p>上海英僑將作簡單儀式</p>
<p>酌捐款項救濟戰士家屬</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰、繼德波交惡後賡續爆發、雙方正以大炮互轟之際、而上海英僑則將於本月　　日舉行「歐戰休戰紀念」、本年追念是項儀式、以時值非常、不得不稍予約制、是日上午八時三十分、由大英戰勝聯合會主席愛坦金領導、以櫻粟花編成之花圈、向黃浦灘、</p>
<p>和平之神</p>
<p>獻呈花圈、該會會員或欲參加之英國僑民、可於是日上午八時一十分、佩帶勳章或獎章、在和平之神像則等待、其儀式聞殊為簡單、上午十時三刻、假九江路二百十九號大英禮拜堂開會、山該堂牧師卻維脫主持儀式、十一時正、全體靜默三分鐘、然後並殿以西福資高地隊第一大隊之管樂、凡欲參加英僑、該會極表歡迎、惟位置並不保留、於舉行儀式後、參加紀念人員、須酌捐款項、以補大英戰勝聯合會之經費、大不列顛之老將宿、往年例有餐敘之舉、本年聞決取銷、即街頭巷尾向有公開、</p>
<p>售櫻粟花</p>
<p>以示各平、本年經決定停售、如英僑平人需要此花、或分贈友好、可於下星期二前向九江路大英戰勝聯合會所免費索取、特別式樣之櫻粟花、點綴於汽車或陳列桌上者、亦可向會所索取、至於汽車上點綴之花圈、將於十一日依普通習慣展覽、凡欲者、固無需費用、但須稍納款項、用以救濟犧牲於戰事者之旅滬家屬、聞該項櫻粟花圈、雖收會方散發、但係來自英國倫敦、其價值高出上海數倍、是以捐助慈善費、亦將提高、是日追念休戰儀式、大英戰勝聯合會當局、將催促所有英僑盡其最大可能、全日佩以花圈、藉以表示紀念光榮戰死之烈士幽魂、</p>
<h3>陳列品琳琅滿目　語文展覽今日開幕</h3>
<p>中西古珍品幾已搜羅殆盡</p>
<p>蔔舫濟林康侯等主持開幕禮</p>
<p>本埠社會名流及語文專家籌備數月之語言語展覽會、定今日上午九時、在南京路大新公司四樓舉行開幕典禮、由下舫濟·林康侯·聞蘭亭·袁履登·陸高誼諸君主持開幕、並發表演說、昨已分發請柬、邀請各界人士參觀、該會展覽物品於昨日下午開始陳列、除先前投到者外、昨日又收到各界送往陳列之物品甚多、</p>
<p>精貴珍異</p>
<p>見所未見、如張鳳之西郵木簡·施尼之秦漢瓦當·丁福保之古泉古書·金尼閣之西儒耳目資·鄭振鐸之利瑪　注音文字·張若穀之蒙古沙王新筆蒙文·瞿西華之薛清碑文·及邢島拼音文字·周越然之</p>
<p>宋元精槧</p>
<p>莽經等版本、以及歸化華籍之英人馬彬和臨摹之猓猓學·天文教藏書樓之錫蘭貝葉經·法文四書五經·蒙古文金光明經·聖經公會之六百九十二種語言之聖經·及九百七十二種語言表·巨幅魏碑·唐人寫經·六朝造像文字等等、美不勝收、尚有劉　之之鐘鼎·愛儷園之古物等、因特別珍貴、故於今晨始送到、該會會場依展覽物品、　為宗教·碑刻·表演·甲骨·古錢·書籍、愛儷園及其他等、專室陳列、該會因收到展覽物品極多、但會場過小、某些輕便物品、均須輪流陣列、該會除於每日上午九時</p>
<p>開始展覽</p>
<p>下午舉行各項表演、並印行該會編著之「中國的字形」·「中國的字音」·「明代發展以來之拼音文字」三書、在會場出售、並有展覽物品目錄、備來賓參攷、使社會人士對中國語文有深刻之認識、五角、商務·中華·世界·醫學等書局及展覽會場、均有發售、連日購者極為擁擠、可見滬上人士對此、均欲一飽眼福也、</p>
<h3>日艦炮擊龍山</h3>
<p>航業界息、鎮海縣屬之龍山洋面、於二十九日上午九時、駛來日艦一艘、向岸連續開炮、達二十七發之多、損失極微、日艦開炮後、即使至鎮海口外　港洋面停泊、鎮海要塞已予監視、龍山碼頭已於去年冬間、駐軍加以澈底破壞、</p>
<h3>匯豐吸收匯後　市場屹然不動</h3>
<p>足見人心穩定一反向例</p>
<p>港資移滬外匯基金充實</p>
<p>關於上海黑市外匯、因為投機者所操縱、以致匯價空前低落、今因政府統制貿易成功、進口貨物稀少、出口土貨反見增加、香港政府實施戰時商業統制、使港方資金轉向上海流入、同時出口商在上海所得之外匯、向黑市接口商在上海所得之外匯、向黑市接踵吐售、港幫多頭一貫作風猛塞不已、致黑市外匯空前轉松、英商匯豐銀行掛牌一再放長、法幣在上海之價格無形上升、經營多頭者心灰氣短、束手無策、每日但見供給者汜濫於市上、小範圍外匯囤戶、實繁有徒、對法幣之信心、不覺油然而生、遂益助成其勁勢、上週匯豐銀行嘗出而吸購英匯、按四便士六二五購入相當數量、而於市況絕無影響、向例市上每聞匯豐發動、必相驚擾、售方立時裹足不前、今乃不然、亦可見市場心理轉變之甚、至於海外僑胞之匯款、過去匯港者、今因港統制、匯兌改道至滬、資金紛紛流入上海矣、</p>
<h3>冬令風季　鎮海駁運困難</h3>
<p>航業界息、月前鎮海駁船、已逐漸增加至百餘艘之多、各輪依次起卸本已足夠支配、但因時屆深秋、鎮海口外係多島之區、每至秋雨季、西北風四面夾擊、風勢甚巨、至駁船載重有限、過風即不能在口外行駛、故最近一月以來、往往因風而停止、駁卸、致使航程重形遲緩、現各輪船公司為設法補救起見、正共同商討改善辦法、俾航程不受冬令風季之影響、</p>
<h3>三浮碼頭巡邏職務　移歸水巡捕房</h3>
<p>專管泊碼頭之舟楫問題</p>
<p>警務調查仍屬諸警務處</p>
<p>—一切案件由特院審理—</p>
<p>大陸報雲、水巡捕房自昨日（一日）起、接代警務處、而擔任海關碼頭前第九·十·與十一號浮碼頭之巡邏職務、惟雙方活動範圍、並不受此巡邏職務之影響、在浮碼頭本身發生之警務調查事宜、由警務處辦理、而關於停泊碼頭一帶舟楫之問題、則由水巡捕房管理、無論在江中或碼頭上之一切案件、照舊由特區法院審理、由於沿外灘之登岸地位、已受限制與舟楫要求暫泊者頗眾、故水巡捕房前已限制港中小舟欲載搭客在外灘上下者、以十分鐘為限、惟小舟停泊、頗多逾限者、故發覺由管轄舟楫之水巡捕房警員在浮碼頭巡羅邏、則辦事較為便利、</p>
<h3>本年馬路積水情形</h3>
<p>浦江與蘇州河久失疏濬</p>
<p>本市地面同時日見低落</p>
<p>工部局工務處設法改善</p>
<p>蘇州河以南租界若幹部份、近年聞常積水泛溢、行人車輛、諸感不便、工部局工務處會擬具疏　計畫、送請工務委員會審核、查馬路積水之原因、可總括為兩端、一為江水高漲、一為雨量過度、茲分述情形如下、</p>
<p>江水高漲</p>

<h3>紫來街棉布號盜刦　探捕盜匪格鬥　死傷盜匪各一四盜成擒</h3>
<p>昨晨七時許、法租界紫來街畔、發生盜匪拒捕開槍、轟擊探捕案、茲將詳情誌後、</p>
<p>裝有警鈴</p>
<p>蘇州人王惠明、素在法租界紫來街四十三弄（即愼興里）十四號內、開設晋昌愼記棉布號、由浦東人湯國柱任經理、平時號內裝有警鈴一具、通至隔璧十七號內、再通至法捕房、蓋用以豫防盜警也、</p>

<h3>上海百景之一　神秘的藥酒店　一個嘗試者的自白</h3>
<p>— 紫虹</p>
<p>病到沒有辦法的時候，科舉家亦要祈求起菩薩來。我的背痠幾天還沒有好，硬着頭皮，闖進那素不相信的膏藥店裏去，我看到了墻上掛的老虎皮，就好像送進了老虎嘴似的。</p>
<p>綠酒瓶，紅膏藥，大蟒蛇，小猻猻，滿屋子都充滿了走江湖的風味。那兜腮鬍子的迎上來盤問了病源，拍起肚子來大聲的說：「趕快治！趕快治！這是瘋。」</p>
<p>莫明其妙的就是一張膏藥塞在手裏，算是最便宜的價錢，一塊錢。膏藥上寫的是「秘製神效萬靈膏」。阿鬍子在我肩上一拍，這一下眞够受，疼得透不過氣來，他却笑嘻嘻的喝道：『朋友，包你奏效，不靈包退還洋！』</p>
<p>在呻吟中渡過了一夜，神秘不見奏，却疼得腫了起來。因為記着他說的「加藥分文不取」，第二次又闖了進去，說得不上三句，像相面先生似的呌伸出手來看，捺捺指甲道：『你這病重藥性輕，應該用一種精製的麝香膏藥，五塊錢一張。」接着他看我不像買的樣子，又說：『把舊膏藥還我，不折不扣，當一元算，我們做生意硬不硬？」</p>
<p>「來，我替你打上幾針，上一點藥，包你全愈！」他說的時候，門口亦有一個病人在用一根很長的針從腿上刺了進去，我有點發抖，他雖說分文不取，打了就走，我亦謝絕了</p>
<p>『那末喝一點追瘋藥酒，二塊四一斤，內服酒，外貼膏藥，內應外合，包你全好！』我佩服他保好的方法眞多。</p>
<p>我看到那綠酒紅蓋的就有點怕，我忙說：『我不會渴酒』</p>
<p>『不會渴？有病不會渴亦得渴，又不是呌你一口氣渴，夾菜裏飯都使得，不會渴？』</p>
<p>『我沒多帶錢。』</p>
<p>『帶多少錢？少買些，六毛好不好？』</p>
<p>『膏藥你說不靈包退還洋，今天又說一天毛孔開，二天藥性到，三天包全愈，那末請你加點藥，三天後再來請敎」</p>
<p>『我說你帶多少錢，我說一塊錢膏藥不是仙丹，好的有：五元，十元，我看你還是渴一點藥酒，你帶多少錢？』</p>
<p>『只有二毛錢１我不會渴酒，買二毛錢好不好？』我故意說。</p>
<p>『好，不要你錢！』他把臉一扳，喝一聲來，呌我脫了外衣站在大門口，圍着許多看的人，他拿我膀子當什麽似的搖着，又反鈎起我的膀子背起來，再抓住我的膀子當扁祖似的硬挑我起來，我呌了起來，小猪猻還把衣服瞎扯，他當衆笑了起來說：『年紀靑靑，這點苦吃不起，包你好，不要你一偭錢，去吧！』在背上一拍，我疼得說不出話來，像從虎口逃出來似的溜了，背後還聽見他說：『毛病，不要你一個錢，包你好！』</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學排小塲</p>
<p>這可見得新聞家的天才，確是占着一個重要部份的，而也是一時難於强求的。邵慧華小姐是生來就賦有新聞天才的，在她十六歲的時候，還在學校裹讀書，她便能訪要聞，辦壁報，人家所不能探到的新聞，她居然能採到了。就是與同學們睹賽比勝，刺探一件秘密悄報，不過是鬧着玩兒的，她也能贏着道個東道。許多同學們，說她是有偵探的本領，將來可以當一個女偵探，為國家出些力。但她不承認道種話，她說：新聞探訪的事，不能與做偵探相提並論。常偵探，當間諜，是一種秘密工作，往往出以詭詐的手段，為了一項重要文件，甚而至於巧取豪奪，是不規於正的。至於採取新聞，那是光明磊落的事，所得新聞，便要宣傳於大衆，披露於世間，實在是一件神聖的工作。况且當偵探間諜的，不免有敵我之見，存乎其間，若是探訪新聞的工作，並不如此。有些新聞的發表，還要經過對方的許可，始能披露。還有一樣一件新聞，於時效上，却有大大的關係咧。天才之外，便是要講到修養了。光有天才，而不加修養，往往為天才所誤，甚至於走入歧途，那是很為危險的。但是怎樣一個修養之法呢？這個問題太大了！簡單的說起來，道德是給有天才的人畫了一個圈，憑你是才高，也不能跳出到道德圈子以外去。自然一個人總有正義感，天才要跳出了正義的範圍，那個天才就要闖禍了。其决就是常識，怎樣呌做常識豐富，常識淺薄，這却跟了時代而進步。常識好比是資本家的本錢，在以前往往這一點兒本錢巳經够了，可是在現在的時世，這一點本錢，却覺到不足。因為時代進步，各種的事物，也就繁賾起來。原來所知道的一點兒常識，覺得很豐富了，但到了現在應該所知道的事情，還要加多。倘然你這樣也不明白，那樣也不靈淸，便要顯見得你知識上的寒傖了。况且當新聞記者的人，是一座常識的大寳庫，眞是古本小說書上所說的：上知天文，下曉地理，三敎九流，無所不通。在古時巳經要如此，何况是現代？在一個普通在社會立足的人，已經要如此，何况是一個新聞記者？（一九八）</p>
<h3>請家長們注意</h3>
<p>— 樹</p>
<p>巳經是深秋了，孩子們的身上都換上了絨錢衣服，於是跟着季節而來的騙子「剝田鷄」也因之上市了，大家也警告着家長們不要把孩子放到街頭去。上海這個社會是到處設着陷阱，騙取一件絨錢衫等的騙子，似乎是不在話下了，譬如報上最近喧傳着專門拐騙兒童，運往海外的消息，那更是防不勝防。所以這袋請家長們注意的，不是防範騙子，而是注意孩子們在街頭的行動。</p>
<p>孩子是好動的，關在家裹不是個辦法，尤其是在寸金地的「孤島』之上。在疛堡之內，</p>
<h3>設倉儲糧</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>在若干時日之前，米價騰漲，使一般的社會生活受到嚴重的影響時，任何人都似乎自己安慰自己的期望於來源暢通，存底加厚；而事實證明來源的窒碍並不十分嚴重，存底亦不薄，價格仍不回跌，叉期望於新穀登塲；而現在新穀巳登塲，米價亦仍其舊，在無可奈何的狀態中，這種社會性的恐懼，憂慮，尤其流溢於每個人的言表。</p>
<p>然而，期望是空洞的，恐懼，憂慮也無補於事實。現在第一特區市民聯合會就建議於公共租界工部局及法租界公董局，於此新穀登塲之際，向產區採運大量國米，在界內設置公倉，實行儲積，以備不時之需；使米價繼續回跌。兩租界當局以此項建議尙合情理，故已予以接受。</p>
<p>雖然，這是一種治標的辦法，但若付諸實施，亦可防患未來的恐慌。我人試由新穀登塲的現在情况而推想到靑黃不接的未來幻象，在不寒而慄之餘，自然極願其早日實現。目前一般貧窮苦力，在生活的重負下，已經就透不過氣來，賴勞力以生活的人，日得一飽，眞是莫大的幸運！何况不得一飽，牛衣對泣，任令社會環境支配其生存的命運的人，尤居多數！他們的窘狀，是隨着時日而加深着。假如米價長此以往，中下階級未來的悽苦景况，當史甚於今日，這是不忍想像的吧？所以設倉儲糧，在無可奈何的環境下，變在是迫切的需要。</p>
<p>這種設倉儲糧的辦法，經租界當局的籌劃，對於充分的資力與龐大的倉庫地位，自然是不成問題的。不過，假若在數量上予以充分擴大的話，那末，市民無利投資的方法，也未始不能收得相當良好的效果。</p>
<p>旣云「無利」，何以會有人投資？難道說笑話？其實不，譬如：設倉儲糧的主管機關，收集市民投資，規定自五元或十元，或若干元起，不給予利息，而給予將來的平鞭優先權，將來可憑收據領取等於數額的米量。在不可捉摸的社會環境演變中，萬一遇到米荒的嚴重階段，投資者即可有恃無恐，（假如自己儲囤，因不能直接向產區採購故無便宜價格）這樣一來，投資的踴躍確是意料得到的吧？</p>
<p>至於公倉，若購地建築，似須加高成本，不如租用各空餘的棧房之類較為經濟。至於疏通來源，取締囤戶，監視操縱等，當亦希望同時進行，以冀得至雙管齊下的收穫。</p>
<p>看着孩子們的到處闖禍，做家長的請他們到弄堂或街頭去嬉戲的也很多，有的如本刋前幾天一篇文章裏說，把他們送到學校去「關蠻」。自然，生在不幸的家庭中的孩子終究是不幸的，能够送到學校去「關蠻」至少還是能受到敎育的倖運者了。其實讓他們從狹小的斗室中放出來而得到一處較大的遊戲地方，適合他們好動的個性，也未始不是沒有花園，和沒有力量送進幼稚園去的一個好所在。可是我們得看一看他們在弄堂裏或街頭幹些什麼？打彈子，在糖攤上賭博還是好的；與流氓為伍，效學各種駡語和打架也是觸目皆是。做家長們根本不知道他們每天在外面做些什麽，能够免去在屋子裏乒乒乓乓地吵鬧，也就什麼不管了。這樣就沉於惡劣的環境，而習慣於惡劣的一切。他們巳經不幸而生長於這樣的家庭中，將來不是更不幸而成為社會的廢人嗎？所以，我覺得不要放孩子們到街頭弄口去是值得注意的一個問題，可是糾正他們在街頭弄口做些什麽的敎育工作是更值得注意！</p>

<h3>無綫電影廣告</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>我們都知道無綫電廣播在今日，已成了一種廣吿的工具，一般商人，都利用無綫電廣播，作自我宜傳，自己的商品，質的方面是怎樣好，售便方面怎樣廉，大减價，大拍賣的消息，不斷的由電台上廣播出來。</p>
<p>基於這個事實，無綫電，電影一朝風行而後，除了供人娛樂之外，和無綫電廣播一樣，一定會被商人當做廣告的工具；而且事實上，好萊塢的影片公司，已首先利用無綫電影當做影片的廣告工具了。</p>
<p>在上海公映過的鉅片「貢格廷」，當初拍攝完竣以後，在紐的和倫敦兩地，曾用無綫電影作為廣告，而派拉蒙更會表示過，從今而後，將把所有的新片，在全美各地，由無綫電來作頂告。</p>
<p>因為無綫電影還是新的東西，美國各邦，目前尙未加以統制商用；同時，現在所發出的照會，在當局都以為並非商用的，所以是吾合法，還一個問題。</p>
<p>美國的國家無綫電播音公司，預定推廣無綫電影廣告事業；因此，正計劃散發一極小冊子，呌做「無綫電影廣告，」每星期預備散發五千二百冊，使商家同時能用聲與影來廣告，推銷商品，自然可獲得更好的效果。</p>

<p>王芸芳父子重逢之奇事</p>
<p>麒麟童之老搭當王芸芳，數年前出演滬上天蟾等舞台時，以作工細膩，態度大方，頗為顧曲界所賞識。惟彼生性好佛，平日家居除作書習畫外，極喜同人研究佛學，每與友人晤面，總是手打問心，心唸阿彌陀佛，倘使別人和他談起家事，他就唏噓長歎，表示無限傷感。每值新年令節，鄰舍及諸同行家共享家庭團聚之樂，他更是悲傷不已，自己常對人說：「我今生是再不能得到父母的眞愛了；只好唸唸佛，修修來世吧！」不料在他將近三十歲的那年，忽然有一王姓老人，竟致函給他，說是他相別二十年的老父。芸芳初接此信時，尙疑為不逞之徒，冒名欺詐，但是經過幾决通訊，並交換照片，迨最後相晤，方纔證明確係共父璧昌。常時芸芳驚喜欲在，自念或係其至誠所感，神佛暗中驅使，故策其父子均離其所居地之魯省，復在蘇省原籍（本江蘇金壇人）重相團聚也。彼驚喜之餘，特設宴於四馬路大雅樓，柬請步林屋，徐朗西，蘇少卿諸先生及慧海禪師與不佞等數人，因上述諸人或則介紹其南來獻藝，或與彼有師弟關係，對彼勉勵敎誨以促其學業有成始得立足於滬上者。當時其父璧昌，亦同席作陪，惟此人則似略有神經病然，竟終席未發一言。余等關於此事之眞偽，固不便即席詳詢，然而可予我輩以表面上之證明者，即璧昌先生之面部身材，殆無一不似芸芳，而眉眼口鼻尤為酷肯。迨其飯罷先行後，衆始詳詢芸芳此事之經過，彼乃有以下之叙述焉。（一三二）</p>

<h3>清平樂</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“They　Shall　Have　Musie”</p>
<p>「清平樂一主要的自然是介十紹提琴聖手的夏海斐滋的提奏演奏，和The　Peter　Meremblum　California　Junior　Symphonyorchestra全片中，的夏海斐滋的提琴演奏，前後三次，並且鄭重介紹他的指法，和弓絃的彈奏，在第一次演奏的時候，鏡顯在各個不同的角度下，攝取他的手指和弓絃的運用。所以對於音樂有興趣，和硏究者，這部特攝的「淸平樂」，是不妨前去一看的。</p>
<p>至於這個穿織起來的故事，寫音樂敎授勞生收取貧苦兒童為學生，以致學校經費無着，負債纍纍，但是在演奏中目睹親自訓練的學生，在藝術上有所成功時，衷心的喜悅，揚於眉際。一個藝人的成功，是經過多少磨折艱苦的心血，這是很感動的。但是這部以音樂為主體的「淸平樂」，導演手腕是太軟弱，如果和同樣題材的「丹鳳朝陽」比較起來，那是不及遠甚。</p>
<p>佐麥克利和安德麗李絲，都沒有戲做。飾敎授勞生的渥爾勃利演來很適合音樂家的風度。譬如發現佛蘭克懂得音符的時候，自己的樂隊奏着一支曲子時，及在音樂會傾聽一個女學生的鋼琴獨奏，一種獲得精神上的安慰的表情，眞切而感人。飾佛蘭克的孩子，也很能演戲，不過這裏沒有充份發展的機會。</p>

(2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to informed sources speaking to reporters today, after the disastrous defeat of Japanese troops in Northern Hunan, the Japanese military authorities immediately convened a military conference in Nanjing. They decided to transfer some reserve units from "Manchukuo" and Taiwan to Central China to reinforce their forces before launching another large-scale offensive, in an attempt to advance further. However, the Kwantung Army did not support this plan, and the Navy was even less supportive, as the Navy's plan advocated launching an offensive along the Zhejiang coast. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese troops on the Hunan front have not yet begun their offensive, but people here firmly believe that the overall attack plan will be implemented soon, as the Japanese have recently mobilized five divisions of troops and moved them into Hunan.

<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Pay Attention to Soviet-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, newspapers here published Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech to the Supreme Soviet on October 31st in prominent positions, but none of the newspapers criticized this speech.

The general opinion seemed to be that Soviet-Japanese relations had not taken a definite form. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zhu De in Shanxi, Not Going to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Xinhua Daily, a Chinese Communist Party publication, today denounced Japanese propaganda aimed at damaging relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

It was claimed that Zhu De had not only not gone to Moscow, but had not even left North China recently, and was currently in Shanxi Province actively commanding military operations against the Japanese army. Chinese Communist troops continue to resist the Japanese army and have recently cooperated with Central Army troops to defeat the Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi Province. The newspaper criticized the Japanese claim that representatives of the Kuomintang and leaders of the Communist Party were meeting in Yan'an to discuss Communist demands to "Sovietize the Northwest." It was claimed that most of the people reported by the Japanese as attending the meeting were actually still in Chongqing. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-American Movement Discovered in Chenliu County; Bounty on American Lady's Head</h3>
<p>Qingdao: According to foreign travelers who arrived here today, the Anti-American United Association in Chenliu County, Henan Province, has posted notices throughout the city, offering a reward of 100 yuan for the head of American female missionary Miss Peterson. The Anti-American Association was reorganized from the Anti-British Association and has not been interfered with by local Japanese officials. Miss Peterson was previously intimidated into leaving the country by the Anti-American Association. The association's purchase of Miss Peterson's head for a small sum of money is an insult to the lady. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Agitation in North China Shows No Sign of Slackening, British Under-Secretary of State Claims in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London: In response to a request from a Member of Parliament for Prime Minister Chamberlain to comment on the situation in China, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the situation in China remains unchanged. There had been fighting in Hunan and Jiangxi, but it now appears that both sides are holding their original positions before the recent Japanese offensive. He was happy to inform the House that the Kulangsu Municipal Council and the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen, Uchida, had reached a compromise on October 17th, stipulating the addition of Japanese police officers. Both American and Japanese marines withdrew from Kulangsu the next day. Although newspapers today reported that the Japanese had ordered the easing of anti-British agitation in North China, there has been no significant slackening of this agitation. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has recently submitted continued representations to the Japanese government. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Leave Chongqing Soon</h3>

It is said that the government spent 100,000 yuan last year for geologists and mineralogists sent to investigate. A plan to cooperate with the Qinghai Provincial Government in mining has now been formulated. (2nd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly Battle Situation; October 25th to 31st</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week (October 25th to 31st), battles have continued to unfold on all fronts, with those north of the Yellow River being relatively fierce. In particular, the large-scale movements of Japanese troops in Western Shanxi have suffered a major blow under strong Chinese resistance, and the Japanese attempts to invade have been completely crushed. Victories have also been achieved on other fronts. The more important aspects of the combat are described below:</p>
<p>Shanxi-Henan Front: Huguan in Southeastern Shanxi is still closely besieged by the Chinese. The strongholds of Fucheng, Hecuan, and Guxianzhen have also been successively recaptured. Three to four thousand Japanese troops in the Quwo, Houma, and Wenxi areas of Southern Shanxi took advantage of artillery cover on the 26th and 27th to attack Nanfanzhen, Anyucun, Nanguocun, and other places, but were met with a head-on attack. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and failed to succeed. The main force of the Japanese Taniguchi Division in Western Shanxi has for days attacked Lvliang Mountain along three routes: Puxian, Lingshi, and Fencheng. At the same time, troops from Taigu, Pingyao, and other places were sent south to reinforce them. The Chinese army has laid a close siege, cutting the Japanese into several segments and attacking them separately in the valleys of Kuanhejing south of Jixian, Canjialing west of Xiangning, Daning, and Gekou. The Japanese left wing, the Saeki Battalion, and two units of the Pu Regiments in the central route all suffered heavy losses. The right wing, the Mikuchi Regiment, was no longer a cohesive unit. All these places have been completely recaptured. The defeated and wounded Japanese troops are struggling desperately, and fierce fighting is ongoing. The Chinese army has also recaptured Doucunzhen, part of Wutai in Northern Shanxi, killing over five hundred Japanese troops. As for the Japanese troops in Bo'ai and Qinyang in Southern Henan, they launched separate attacks on Baimahui and Xikaizhen, but were repulsed by the Chinese army. In recent days, the Chinese army in Eastern Henan has launched a multi-pronged attack, and the Japanese troops in Huaiyang and Kaifeng have now been forced to the outskirts of Huaiyang and once charged to the South Gate of Kaifeng, achieving many victories.</p>
<p>Shandong-Hebei Front: Over three thousand Japanese troops in Xintai, Laiwu, and other places in Southern Shandong launched a counter-offensive against the Chinese army on the 25th from Lucun, Xionggui, and Kuangrui, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely charged into the Japanese formation, recapturing the village and continuing to recapture Zhuangshimeng, Jiuxian, and other places, pressing towards Laiwu County. The Chinese army in Eastern Hebei has for days been attacking the Japanese troops in Yunhua and Hunjie, killing over a hundred Japanese troops. The war is now in a stalemate. The Japanese troops in Datun have been attacked by the Chinese regiment for many days. The Japanese have made several unsuccessful attempts to break through. This week, they launched another reinforced counterattack, but were killed in countless numbers. The Japanese troops in Datun have all retreated, and the area has been recaptured. Another unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to attack the Japanese troops in Jixian and Nangong in Southern Hebei. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese position was shaken and they are currently holding on while awaiting reinforcements. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Key Points of Japanese Policy Towards Supporting Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reports that Japan's attitude and policy towards the "new Chinese regime" about to be organized by Wang Jingwei are to immediately grant it de facto recognition, not to interfere in China's internal affairs, and to establish a Sino-Japanese Economic Conference to promote a closer economic alliance between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Japan's basic policy for resolving the China situation is to realize a "New Order in East Asia" through both construction and warfare. The key points of Japan's policy towards the Wang regime are as follows: (1) Japan will provide unlimited assistance to Wang Jingwei's preparations for the establishment of a "New Central Government of China" and expects it to be established soon. (2) Japan, from the standpoint of respecting China's sovereignty, anticipates the smooth and automatic development of an independent and free China. (3) Japan pays special attention to the political organization of the new regime. Japan especially wants the special characteristics of North China and Inner Mongolia to finally be realized. (4) When the new government is established, Japan is prepared to immediately recognize it de facto and send an ambassador plenipotentiary. (5) Japan will then seek the adjustment and harmonization of Sino-Japanese relations in politics, economics, and culture. (6) Regarding internal affairs, culture, education, etc., the Japanese government is willing for the new government to pursue its own independent policies, but the Japanese government will not hesitate to provide any assistance or cooperation when needed. (7) From this standpoint, the Japanese government will absolutely avoid any form of assistance that could give the impression of Japanese interference in China's internal affairs, such as assigning political advisors. (8) However, Japan is prepared to send a financial advisor to China if the new government so desires. (9) In the field of natural sciences and civil engineering, Japan is prepared to provide technical and personnel assistance upon request. (10) Regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation, in order to further strengthen the economic unity of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo," it is planned to organize a Sino-Japanese Economic Conference, such as the one that currently exists between Japan and the North China Provisional Government, as a joint Sino-Japanese mechanism to implement mutual and equal economic cooperation.

<p>Tokyo: The decision of the Asia Development Board yesterday regarding the new Chinese regime was not submitted to the cabinet today. However, this matter needs to be handled quickly, so the government has decided to convene a special cabinet meeting on Saturday morning. After the cabinet approves this decision, Prime Minister Abe will enter the Imperial Palace to request the Emperor's approval. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Comprehensive View of Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>On October 31st, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the current international situation and the "Principles of Soviet Foreign Policy" at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The abundance of its content and the weight of its substance are rarely seen in speeches by authorities of various countries on international issues in recent years. Reading his words and looking to the future, one will deeply feel that "the ideas and actions of the Soviet Union are truly elusive." However, the various actions of the Soviet Union in the past seventy years have already been deeply etched in the hearts and minds of the world. Now, with this comprehensive speech by its authorities, it is akin to having a skilled photographer take an exceptionally clear "copy;" the true face is clearly visible, and those who care about world changes and historical facts can scrutinize it carefully.</p>
<p>Molotov's words are worthy of attention. The value lies not in truth, for such words do not contain any truth, and hardly any truth contains such words. Its value lies in the international sphere. Soviet sages have made many contributions to the international community: in the distant past, Lenin promoted communism, which the toiling masses of the world yearn for; more recently, Litvinov interpreted the definition of aggression, which the weak and small nations of the world yearn for. All these aspirations transcend national boundaries, forming a torrent, and are highly respected by the international community. Now, Molotov's words are different in nature from the contributions of Lenin and Litvinov, and their relevance to the international community is also significant. Because in the past, the international community had completely different perceptions of the Soviet Union, and at least two of these perceptions were "serious errors:" one was the mistaken belief that Soviet policy was based on right and wrong that transcended national boundaries, which is now corrected by Molotov's explanation; that is, the Soviet Union's policy is based on the Soviet state, and for the sake of the Soviet state's "rights" and "security," its policy extends its "obligations," "open doors," and "military bases" beyond its national boundaries into other countries' national boundaries; this kind of policy has nothing to do with so-called right and wrong. The second was the mistaken belief that communism was an overriding golden rule, which is now also corrected by Molotov's explanation; that is, "Hitler's ideology is the same as any ideology." Of course, the ideology of communism is also one of any ideology, and it is not an overriding golden rule, but merely a "matter of each person's political stance;" a golden rule is solemn and sacred, supreme and unparalleled, while a political stance allows for flexibility and compromise, being relative. These two misconceptions have contributed to the international torrent for quite some time, and Molotov has corrected them. Therefore, it is said that the value of his words lies in the international sphere.</p>
<p>From Molotov's words, one can firmly believe that the Soviet Union has been fundamentally peaceful in the past seventy years; even in Polish territory, after "the disintegration of Poland," "a major war broke out with the Polish army," and even under the policy of peace, the Soviet Red Army suffered 2,600 casualties. However, considering the vast area of 196,000 square kilometers and the population of 13 million, the blood shed by those 2,600 people can be said to be the blood of peace. Moreover, the three small Baltic countries were able to accept the Soviet Union's peaceful policy with a peaceful attitude even before they disintegrated; this is truly a great success for the Soviet Union, which Molotov is delighted to talk about.</p>
<p>"The ideas and actions of the Soviet Union are truly elusive." Although Molotov repeatedly stated that "the Soviet Union will continue to consistently pursue a peaceful foreign policy," it seems that its peaceful intentions and peaceful actions can be made clear to the world and do not need to be grasped. Moreover, Molotov stated that the Soviet Union "stayed out of" this dangerous war situation, which coincides with our previous inference that the Soviet Union's basic policy was to observe the war. Continuing peace, is there any doubt? However, there are aspects that cannot be generalized. Regarding the Finnish matter, he said, "The Soviet Union had no choice but to take strict measures to ensure security," and "The Finnish government should accept our proposal, and our proposal is the minimum measure." Regarding the Turkish matter, he said, "In the future, Turkey is something we will not regret, and we will not make predictions." Following his words, he is still sharpening his knife. Where is the certainty of peace? Not only that, but does the world not remember that the day after the Soviet Union signed a border cessation of hostilities agreement with Japan, it marched into Poland? Now, Molotov's speech on European disputes only remotely presents a kissing posture towards Japan. How can we know that this enchantment of Japan is not a sign of something being done in Europe? Whether the knife is sharpened or not, whether the signs are consistent or not, manipulation is in their hands, and it is still elusive.</p>
<p>After hearing Molotov's speech, some people felt a sense of loss, asking why there was not a single word about China? From far away Europe and America to nearby Shanghai, they questioned each other. We have unwavering faith: the Soviet Union's current policy is clearly based on its national rights and security, as has already been said. Only a strong China will not harm the rights and security of the Soviet Union in Asia, and there will be no fear of any threats. Therefore, the Soviet Union must maintain its goodwill towards China, this is one. The Soviet Union's current diplomacy, that is, the Soviet Union's diplomacy on the day of Molotov's speech, apart from diplomatic issues related to the Soviet Union itself, mainly involves using all peaceful means to support Germany; whether it is criticizing Britain and France, satirizing the United States, threatening Turkey, or even showing goodwill to Japan, it is all for Germany; providing Germany with economic convenience and assistance, engaging in diplomatic maneuvering for Germany, seeking historical reversals for Germany, and finding theoretical bases for Germany, it uses every means to the extreme. What it does not do is shed blood for Germany; if it sheds blood, it is not for Germany but for the Soviet Union itself. Even Molotov's speech can be said to be entirely for Germany; this is the second reason. Not mentioning China is because China has never wronged Germany, and it is also because it is different from Japan, because China does not want to feign between Britain and Germany!</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Reports to the House of Commons on the Military and Diplomatic Situation: Poor Weather Causes a Lull in the Fighting, and the Future Goals of the Soviet Union Are Worth Noting</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain recently reported to the House of Commons this afternoon on the military situation of the past week, roughly stating, "The weather has been poor in the past week, and visibility has been poor. The activities of the army, navy, and air force have all been affected. As for the army, the activities of the French and German troops have been limited to mutual shelling during local operations. Although the front lines are suffering from dampness and cold, our expeditionary forces are still able to consolidate their defense zones as quickly as possible. According to reports from all sides, our troops are very harmonious with the local residents. As for the navy, the war situation has been relatively quiet in the past week. Enemy submarines have still been sunk by our side, and our country has also lost several merchant ships, but our confidence in overcoming submarines has not been shaken in the slightest. As for the air force, German aircraft have engaged in fierce battles with our fighter jets, especially when enemy aircraft attacked our convoy of merchant ships. Our aircraft and warships have not suffered any losses, and several enemy aircraft have been shot down. Our aircraft have also flown to northwestern Germany for reconnaissance in the past week, and have taken many important photos at a low altitude of 300 feet. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was densely fired in an attempt to stop it, it was ultimately ineffective." As for the international situation, although Berlin has been waiting for a long time for the speech delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday, October 31, in my opinion, Germany is now disappointed by it. The British government has carefully studied the full text of the speech, and in particular, the section on the future goals of the Soviet government is of particular concern to us. Molotov once declared in May of this year, "We stand for maintaining peace and preventing all new aggressions." The British government's position is exactly the same. Although Molotov made many imaginative remarks when interpreting the goals of the two Allied nations of Britain and France, I do not take them seriously. Our position has been clearly stated, and I believe that most countries in the world approve of it. In addition, the talks conducted by the government and representatives of the autonomous territories are sufficient to prove the determination of all parts of the British Empire and the spirit of their sincere unity. We are discussing with these representatives the adjustment methods for individual efforts to implement common tasks. How sincere the spirit of cooperation among all parts of the British Empire is, we have now made clear. After the representatives of the autonomous territories came here, we have gained a more complete understanding of the plans formulated by the governments of these autonomous territories. Its value is very great. We believe that the representatives of the governments of the autonomous territories and the government of India will take this opportunity to gain a more practical understanding of the most appropriate and rapid solutions to various common problems. This common affair is also very important. In short, all parts of the empire, including all colonies, are cooperating with us enthusiastically, and there are countless telegrams of allegiance. These telegrams are not out of our request. In other words, the government has not forced the colonies to join the war. If so many different races can automatically cooperate with us, it shows that any threat to Britain is also enough to threaten the freedom and welfare of the residents of British territories. However, in the early stages of the war, what we asked of the colonies was mainly economic assistance, and we hoped that they would transport various raw materials to Britain. The government is also willing to fully utilize the manpower of the colonies and is currently drafting concrete plans. As for the current situation, the strength of the West African Frontier Force has more than doubled, and the East African Rifles have also tripled. The number of subjects of the empire applying to volunteer for service is far beyond our needs. The subjects of all colonies and protectorates are on an equal footing with the subjects within the United Kingdom and can join the British army for service. From the above, it is not difficult to know the general nature of the assistance we can obtain from all parts of the empire." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Announce Successful Naval Escorts: 500,000 Tons of German Contraband Seized, British Ship Sunk Again by German Submarine</h3>
<p>London: According to semi-official sources today, as of the end of October, the number of Allied merchant ships escorted by British warships was 2,500, which shows the development of the British escort system. Since the first week after the start of the war, merchant ship losses have been greatly reduced. To date, only eight of the escorted ships have been lost, accounting for only one in 200. The thoroughness of the escort system shows the large number of British escort ships. According to observers, the most effective way for Britain to protect merchant ships is still to destroy the enemy's attacking forces. Britain's measures to resist submarines are quite strong, as can be seen from the heavy losses of German submarines and their forced departure from the route. The German command's claim that the war to destroy British shipping is proceeding according to plan is considered here to be inconsistent with the facts. The losses suffered by British shipping to and from British ports are less than 1% in two months, and the construction of new ships exceeds this. The number of German ships captured by Britain is also more than the number of British ships lost. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>London: Minister of Economic Warfare Cross gave a broadcast speech tonight, roughly stating that since the outbreak of the war, the warships of the Allied nations of Britain and France have intercepted more than 500,000 tons of contraband bound for Germany. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that the 4,000-ton British ship "Blanty" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic. The crew of 40 and one passenger, a 71-year-old inventor, have all landed at a British port. It is reported that the "Blanty" was attacked a few days ago and floated on the surface of the sea for a long time. Another merchant ship attempted to tow it into port, but failed. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: A radio telegram from the British ship "Elba" was recently intercepted here, claiming that the ship was attacked by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean, 240 miles east of Madeira Island, a Portuguese territory, this morning. Fortunately, it escaped and was not damaged, and is still continuing to sail. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>New York: The British ship "Colmore" (3,670 tons) sent a distress signal yesterday in the sea 680 miles east of New York. Six U.S. Coast Guard ships and two seaplanes immediately went to the rescue, but failed to find the ship's whereabouts. People fear that the ship has been sunk. U.S. military officials here have begun to discuss whether German submarines are lurking in this area. In addition to attempting to rescue the 34 crew members on board the British ship, the U.S. authorities also want to search the area to see if there are any ships or submarines of belligerent countries. Coast Guard ships have begun to set out to search. If the location stated in the signal sent by the "Colmore" is correct, then this fact occurred within the neutral zone mentioned in the Panama Declaration of the Pan-American Conference. The naval authorities have dispatched destroyers and aircraft to assist the Coast Guard in carrying out the search. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Times correspondent stationed in Panama Port recently sent a telegram stating that, according to reliable sources, the German oil tanker "Friedrich" loaded 40,000 boxes of kerosene from the port of Tampico, Mexico, on the 19th of last month. After sailing out to sea, it sailed to the Caribbean Sea on the 24th and turned off all the lights on the ship. At that time, it suddenly met the British cruiser "Taspech." The captain of the cruiser immediately sent a signal asking the reason for turning off the lights. The captain of the oil tanker replied that it was because the lighting equipment was damaged. The captain of the cruiser then ordered the ship to stop. The captain of the oil tanker refused to comply on the pretext of mechanical failure. The captain of the cruiser found it strange and ordered it to stop again for inspection, and sent a team of sailors to the ship. They saw that all 40 sailors were standing next to the lifeboats. When the sailors ordered them to leave, they refused to comply. At this point, the captain of the ship came out in person and said, "We have pierced the bottom compartment, and this ship is about to sink. You should quickly lower the lifeboats." The British sailors then led all the crew members off the ship and let it sink on its own, and then sent all the crew members to British Jamaica for detention. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Western Front Shelling</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a war report today stating, "There was shelling on the Western Front yesterday." (Hai Dian, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 117, stating, "Light infantry units on both sides were quite active in various places on the front line today." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 118, stating, "The front line was calm last night." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British King Returns to London After Inspection</h3>
<p>London: The British King inspected various air force stations in northern and central England for two days and has now returned to London. The King inspected various types of aircraft and talked with many air force personnel fighting, listening carefully to their descriptions of adventurous situations, and was deeply moved.

<h3>Finnish Delegation Arrives in Moscow to Continue Negotiations with the Soviet Union: Finnish Foreign Minister Expresses Determination to Maintain Independence and Willingness to Guarantee the Security of Leningrad for the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Finnish delegation arrived here at 10:00 this morning. This is their third visit. The Director of Protocol of the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Russian expert and former Minister to the Soviet Union, Hjalmar Haraldson Procopé, is also in the delegation. The Director of Protocol of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Bagov, and many officials, as well as ministers from Scandinavian countries, welcomed them at the station. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko said in a speech last night that Finland could not agree to any arrangement that would cause Finland to lose its independence and opportunity for self-defense. Finland did not see that the Finnish nation or land posed a threat to the security of the Soviet Union. If a third country attempts to use Finland as a base to attack the Soviet Union, we will resist this attempt with all our strength. Finland has announced that it is willing to help the Soviet Union strengthen the defenses of Leningrad and Finland. The Treaty of Tartu (by which Finland gained independence) and the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty should be the basis for all possible negotiations. It is reported that the Finnish cabinet decided to send a delegation to Moscow for the third time to negotiate with the Soviet government after a long discussion. The delegation carries Finland's "last word" and will arrive in Moscow today. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Diplomatic sources here recently stated that the Soviet Union's demands on the Finnish government were originally intended to be kept secret, but have now been leaked by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The Finnish government is very dissatisfied, but has still decided to continue negotiations. The fact that it has allowed the delegation to go to Moscow shows that the delegation's instructions are sufficient as a basis for negotiations. In Finnish public opinion, however, there is unanimous opposition to ceding any land on the east and west coasts to the Soviet Union for the construction of naval bases, so as not to threaten the southern coast and the Baltic Sea transport line. On the other hand, some of the demands made by the Soviet Union to ensure the security of Leningrad can be accepted. In addition, Molotov said that a third country would exert pressure on Finland, which is surprising, because Finland initially accepted negotiations and decided to continue negotiations at this time out of its own volition and was not influenced by other countries. In short, Finland is a small country, and it is difficult to understand how it could threaten the powerful Soviet Union, and it has not been seen that any country can use Finnish territory to threaten the Soviet Union. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Regarding the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, newspapers here, regardless of party affiliation, unanimously declared that certain demands of the Soviet government, especially the demands to establish military bases in Finland's Hanko Port or Bergara Port, and that the entire Karelian Isthmus between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga should be demilitarized, are absolutely unacceptable to Finland. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to cede some land on the Karelian Peninsula to Finland, this is far from the Finnish demilitarization of the Karelian Isthmus and the cession of territory north of Petsamo Port. The newspapers also published many articles by military experts, who said that the Soviet Union intends to control Finland's entire national defense organization. However, as far as Sweden is concerned, if the Soviet Union were to set foot on Finland's Åland Islands (only 20 miles from Stockholm), Sweden would suffer a major threat. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to a report received here from the Finnish delegation in Moscow, the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, which were interrupted on October 23, were originally scheduled to resume tonight, but have now been changed to begin tomorrow, because Stalin and Molotov are attending the extraordinary meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today and cannot find time. According to the Finnish representative's telephone report, when the Director of Protocol of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Bagov, met with them, he was extremely cordial. (Haitong Dian, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Tank Convoy Enters Vilnius: Disturbances Occur Locally</h3>
<p>Kaunas: Yesterday night, 40 Soviet tanks suddenly drove into Vilnius from Vievis for unknown reasons. Before the Soviet tanks arrived, there were anti-Jewish demonstrations and marches in Vilnius, beating Jews and entering Jewish homes, wantonly destroying and looting for several hours. Several Jews were seriously injured. Afterwards, Lithuanian troops were deployed in the streets. The Jewish committees in Vilnius and Kaunas are currently appealing to the Lithuanian government. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Kaunas: According to news received here, there were many Polish demonstrations in Vilnius yesterday. Because the price of bread has tripled, they gathered in front of shops to protest and marched towards the city hall. When the police tried to stop them, a conflict broke out between the two sides, resulting in two or three people killed and 40 people injured. Order was restored from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (Haitong Dian, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Decides to Incorporate West Ukraine into the Soviet Union: Accepts the Petition of the National Assembly of West Ukraine</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Federal and National Chambers, continued to hold joint meetings. A delegation of special commissioners from the National Assembly of West Ukraine issued a declaration requesting approval for West Ukraine to join the Soviet Socialist Federation. The declaration was read by Professor Panichkin, a member of the delegation. Several other members then spoke one after another, including Professor Studynsky of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, oil worker Kravchuk, female worker Tayzhuk, farmer Gavrishchuk, and Polish female worker Guzminska, who described the suffering of the people of West Ukraine under Polish rule in the past, as well as their current happiness after being liberated, and expressed their deep gratitude to the Red Army, the Soviet government, and Stalin. Subsequently, the assembly held a debate. Members of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Bohomolets and the famous writer Korniychuk spoke in favor of the merger of West Ukraine and the Soviet Union. Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union Vyshinsky spoke on behalf of the government and proposed the following draft resolution: "The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, having listened to the declaration of the special commission of the National Assembly of West Ukraine, hereby formally resolves as follows: 1. To accept the petition of the National Assembly of West Ukraine and to allow West Ukraine to join the Soviet Socialist Federation and to reunite with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Federation. 2. To instruct the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to designate a date for the election of deputies from the West Ukraine region to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. 3. To authorize the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to incorporate West Ukraine into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. 4. To consult the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Republic on the draft regional division of the border area between the Ukrainian Republic and the Belarusian Republic and to submit it to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for adjudication." The aforementioned draft resolution was voted on separately by the two chambers. As a result, it was unanimously adopted by the entire Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. At that time, the venue resounded with thunderous applause, expressing support. The next joint meeting of the Supreme Soviet is scheduled to be held at 6:00 p.m. on November 2. (TASS, 1st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prepares to Withdraw from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>London – According to a Geneva dispatch, the Soviet government intends to withdraw from the League of Nations. The Soviet embassy here has neither confirmed nor denied this. It is generally said that if this news is true, then the Soviet ambassador Maisky, who is about to take office as chairman of the current session of the League of Nations Council, would have been notified of this intention by his government. Moreover, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently sent a letter to Ambassador Maisky, informing him that the regular session of the Council would be held on December 4 this year, and the ambassador replied in the name of his government that this was acceptable. In light of this, the above news may not be credible. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Minerals Transported to Germany via Waterways</h3>
<p>London – According to exchange telegraph reports, a correspondent in Istanbul cabled last night that a German ship, fully loaded with Soviet minerals such as chromium, manganese, and other various mineral seedlings, entered the Danube River from the Black Sea and reached Germany. At the same time, German ships that had taken refuge in Hungary after the outbreak of the European War have now resumed their activities. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Total Number of Soviet Troops Stationed in Estonia</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Capital of Sweden – According to a telegram received here from the capital of Estonia, the Soviet troops being transferred to Estonia have already begun to take their positions. Naval bases and airfields have all begun construction. It is understood that the total number of Soviet troops currently stationed in Estonia is 22,500, including 9,000 in Hapsal Harbor, 5,000 in Oesel, 7,000 in Port District, and 1,500 in Dagö Island.

<h3>Netherlands Under Martial Law and Prepares Flood Defenses</h3>
<p>The Hague – The government authorities have recently declared martial law in all provinces of the country (except for three provinces). All powers have been transferred to the military authorities. There are rumors that German troops are concentrating near the Dutch border. The Dutch government's actions are intended to prevent future troubles and to safeguard its independence. (One Was News, 1st)</p>
<p>The Hague – The government will soon declare martial law in certain areas of the Netherlands to deal with aggression. After that, administrative power will be entirely in the hands of the military authorities. This measure was announced yesterday by the Dutch Prime Minister in the Lower House and will be implemented in some border areas. The plan to flood the land will also be part of this measure. It is learned that during the World War, the Netherlands took similar action. According to official sources, the Dutch authorities have already stored water in some areas so that they can be flooded in case of attack. In addition, the authorities do not intend to add any further restrictions on newspapers. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Belgian Newspapers Advocate Joint Defense with the Netherlands, the Netherlands Hesitates</h3>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland – The Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently reported that Belgian newspapers are deeply concerned that if the Netherlands is invaded, Belgium's security will also be threatened. They generally advocate that the two countries should form a defensive alliance. Although the Belgian authorities are happy to do so, the Netherlands has some hesitations for the following four reasons: First, Germany may regard this alliance as a provocative move. Second, the impact on the Netherlands' interests when Belgium is invaded is not as great as the impact on Belgium's interests when the Netherlands is invaded. Third, the Dutch border line is very long, and it is difficult to send troops to Belgium to assist in the war when necessary. Fourth, even if Britain and France invade Belgium, the Netherlands is unwilling to allow Germany to pass through its territory to aid Belgium. In short, the Netherlands' main goal is to maintain complete independence. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>The Hague – The possibility of a military alliance between the Netherlands and Belgium has been denied here. According to responsible sources, the Dutch government will never enter into a military alliance with Belgium because their principle of neutrality even hinders discussions between the two countries' staff officers. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Swiss Espionage Case</h3>
<p>Geneva – The Swiss espionage case is scheduled for secret trial in Lausanne today. The main culprit is Blanc, who obtained the help of accomplices to draw military maps and send them abroad. The prosecutor requests that the main culprit Blanc be sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights. The six accomplices should be sentenced to imprisonment for two to three months. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Turkish President's Speech to Prevent the Spread of War, Iran Approves the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty</h3>
<p>Ankara, the Capital of Turkey – President İsmet İnönü delivered a speech yesterday at the National Assembly, stating that the true goal of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty is not only to safeguard Turkey's security but also to establish a safe zone in Europe during the war to prevent the spread of war. The commitments that we have accepted from the two Allied nations of Britain and France are not enough to harm the friendly relations that our country maintains with other countries. We firmly believe that we will be able to stay out of the war, but the security of the country must not be endangered. The commitments that we have accepted from the Allied nations must be implemented when necessary. As for the negotiations that our country recently conducted with the Soviet government, although we have not obtained satisfactory conclusions, the friendship between the two countries still maintains a strong foundation and will not be shaken by the temporary needs caused by the international situation. In short, our country will be friendly with all friendly nations on the one hand, and will continue to fulfill its commitments on the other. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Baghdad – The Regent of Iran expressed his approval of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish treaty at the opening of parliament today, stating that "this treaty allows this part of the world to look forward to the future with confidence." (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Swedish-German Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Capital of Sweden – Germany and Sweden are scheduled to conduct business negotiations here today to "adjust bilateral trade relations under the current circumstances." Although Sweden wants to adjust to a certain extent, if Germany wants to implement the so-called "continental trade plan" and induce Sweden to abandon trade with Britain, the Swedish government will firmly reject it. Regarding this matter, the editorial published by the Social Democratic Newspaper is sufficient to reflect the official view, stating that "Sweden's goal is to maintain normal trade relations with both Britain and Germany within the scope of strict neutrality." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Crew of the City of Flint Safe</h3>

<h3>Hitler Summons Ambassador to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Berlin – Hitler summoned the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, back to Germany today to report on the results of his talks with the Soviet government and the negotiations on the Soviet-German trade agreement. It is also reported that Hitler will also order the German ambassadors stationed in other countries to return to the country to report on their duties, so as to understand the general situation in Europe. The National Socialist Party's research on Molotov's speech has led to the recognition that the Soviet Union will not intervene in the European war by force unless Britain and France threaten the Black Sea region.

<h3>Molotov's Speech Triggers Debate in the U.S. House of Representatives, One Congressman Suggests Recalling the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Roosevelt Releases a Previous Telegram from Kalinin</h3>
<p>Washington – During today's debate on the neutrality bill in the House of Representatives, Democrat McCormack, because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attacked U.S. President Roosevelt in his speech to the Soviet Congress, demanded the recall of the ambassador to the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Foreign Minister's criticism was intended to influence American public opinion and was a violation of international law. This sparked a heated debate. Republican Congressman Fish opposed this demand, saying that McCormack's arguments were extremely warlike and unprecedented since the U.S. declaration of war in 1917. McCormack replied that we, as the American people, should place our country in the position of opposing the Godless faction and assisting the Christian and democratic factions. Republican Patton stated that preserving the arms embargo could help end the European war sooner, and that repealing the embargo would be a true historical sign of the outbreak of war. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington – Massachusetts Democratic Congressman McCormack spoke at a meeting of the House of Representatives yesterday, strongly attacking Molotov's speech, saying that Molotov's criticism of the U.S. Neutrality Act amendment violated international law, and suggested that the government recall the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. McCormack continued, "Not canceling the arms embargo clause is an indirect aid to the Soviet Union and Germany." Iowa Democratic Congressman Izac spoke in support of the administration's neutrality bill and also mentioned Molotov's speech, calling Molotov "Hitler's right-hand man, whose attacks on us are because we have not done what they wanted us to do." New York Republican Congressman Fish attacked McCormack's speech, calling it "the most inflammatory speech for war since 1917." (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington – White House Secretary Early recently told reporters that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov criticized President Roosevelt's attitude towards the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union. This happened when U.S. Congressmen were about to vote on the Neutrality Act amendment, which was not "accidental." President Roosevelt had not read the full text of the speech, but I personally had read some paragraphs in the newspapers. "I can't help but wonder if Molotov's views are accidental. Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland have been conducted in extreme secrecy in the past three weeks. It is noteworthy that Molotov revealed the issues being discussed at this time." Secretary of State Hull also told reporters that Molotov's speech does not need to be commented on, but it must be said that any friendly country is justified in mediating with other countries in order to maintain peace, which is generally recognized. In addition, when the House of Representatives met today, Democratic Congressman McCormack gave a speech saying that Molotov's speech was a "means" of interfering with the discussion of the U.S. Neutrality Act amendment. The U.S. government should recall the ambassador to the Soviet Union to protest Molotov's criticism of President Roosevelt. The Congressmen applauded enthusiastically for a long time. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington – After President Roosevelt telegraphed German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on April 14 this year, calling for peace, Soviet Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin telegraphed his admiration, which was recently released by the White House, stating that "Your Excellency's call from a high place has been warmly responded to by all nations who sincerely wish to maintain world peace." This is the only formal response made by President Roosevelt since Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov gave a speech criticizing President Roosevelt's interference in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>New York – After Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov criticized the United States for not giving freedom to Cuba and the Philippine Islands in his speech, The New York Times recently commented that "Cuba had previously allowed the United States to intervene in its affairs for financial reasons. Now, the country has been a completely free and independent nation for five years. As for the Philippine Islands, they will also achieve independence in 1946. All of this is known to students in Cuba, the Philippines, and the United States. It is insulting to their intelligence to be told about these events. It is hard to believe that Molotov's knowledge is so poor." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries Regarding the Soviet Union's Attitude, Germany Reveals Disappointment, Japan Raises Several Hopes</h3>
<p>Berlin – After Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov gave his speech, German officials were extremely disappointed. This has been seen by observers in various neutral countries, but the German media still wants to cover it up, still calling the Soviet Union "the most progressive country in the world." The National Observer lightly mocked it in an article, stating that "If Britain and France want to expand the current local war into World War II, the Soviet government will definitely resist it with all its strength. Molotov faithfully stated his views in his speech yesterday. He did not make empty promises to the Soviet Union's allies, but severely warned those who were tempted by foreign forces. In short, the Soviet Union will not allow anyone to attack Germany within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, a guarantee that is not only limited to the Baltic coast but also extends to the Black Sea." In addition, a certain newspaper also stated that "Germany can have a strong Soviet Union as a shield," which is enough to reflect the uneasy mentality of the German authorities. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome – Political figures here believe that Molotov's speech failed to confirm optimistic hopes or terrifying predictions. They believe that this speech was entirely neutral in tone, and the arguments in the first part are quite similar to those of Germany. It can be regarded as a declaration of spiritual unity between the Soviet Union and Germany. On the other hand, although the Soviet Union maintains neutrality, it still supports Germany's peace efforts. The Soviet Union's important position has been confirmed, because Britain and France failed to form an alliance with the Soviet Union after months of negotiations. Moreover, the current position of the Soviet Union cannot be regarded as an expression of friendship towards Britain and France, but Britain and France do not hate the Soviet Union. Romanian figures believe that although Molotov criticized democratic countries, the Soviet Union is already in a superior political position. When the League of Nations General Assembly meets in December, the Soviet Union may launch a peace offensive in Geneva. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers have welcomed Molotov's proposal to re-establish friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, but only on the condition that the Soviet Union amends its Far East policy and cuts off relations with General Chiang Kai-shek. The Asahi Shimbun said that if the Soviet Union is sincere, the conclusion of a Soviet-Japanese barter agreement is inevitable. The Kokumin Shimbun speculated that if peace in Europe is agreed upon, Japan will have sufficient reason to fear U.S. intervention in China. Japanese public opinion supports closer ties with Germany and Italy, with the Soviet Union also joining. The Kouchi Shimbun commented on Molotov's speech, stating that although the resolution of border disputes and the arrangement of trade exchanges are both beneficial to the improvement of relations between the two countries, they cannot be called major. The prerequisite for a major improvement in relations between the two countries is obviously the withdrawal of Soviet forces from China and the termination of aid to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The fact that Molotov did not mention China at all in this speech raises the question of whether the Soviet government is prepared to establish a political agreement with Japan regarding the Far East. Judging from the surface of Molotov's speech, it seems that there is a strong desire to improve Soviet-Japanese relations. Conflicts on the border, disputes over fisheries treaties, and the resentment caused by various minor incidents between the two countries since 1931 may disappear from now on. Foreign Minister Nomura also announced his policy of adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations on October 21. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan's position towards the Soviet Union is different from that of Britain and France. Britain and France are eager to obtain the Soviet Union's cooperation in order to contain Germany's power. However, Japan's position is that even without the Soviet Union's support, it can implement its own policies. Moreover, there are ideological boundaries between Japan and the Soviet Union, so Japan must adhere to its anti-communist policy. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>London – The Times commented today on Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent speech, stating that Berlin was looking forward to Molotov's speech with great anticipation, but now they must be greatly disappointed to see that he worded it this way, because the only real decision in his speech was that the Soviet Union would continue to maintain neutrality. Although Molotov mentioned little about the Soviet Union's relations with Japan and Turkey, it is heard that Soviet-Turkish relations have remained cordial since the recent breakdown of negotiations, and negotiations will continue to be held. If both countries are determined to consolidate the unity of the Balkan countries, then their interests should not be difficult to reconcile. However, communism is a disruptive force, coupled with Pan-Slavism, which may not be able to promote the unity of Southeast Europe. The most honest statement in Molotov's speech seems to be an explanation of the Soviet Union's future goals, that is, to let go in international affairs. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Princess Defects</h3>

<h3>China's Determination to Resist Japan Is Not Affected by International Developments, Yen Hui-ching Makes a Statement in the United States</h3>
<p>Washington – According to Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the former Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union and now the chief representative of China at the Pacific Relations Conference, he told reporters from the Associated Press today that he does not believe that the new alignment of countries in the world, such as the cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany, and the Soviet-Japanese compromise that Molotov mentioned, can affect China's position in resisting Japan. China is determined to continue resisting Japan until the Japanese militarists realize that China cannot be conquered. When asked if he had been appointed as the Chinese Ambassador to the United States or other countries, Yen replied that he had previously served as an envoy in the United States and the Soviet Union. As for his future plans, he would spend the rest of his years engaged in private and semi-official work, such as the work he is currently undertaking at the Pacific Relations Conference. He also said that the current international situation is very complicated, so it is extremely difficult to provide a detailed explanation of the development of the European situation and clarify its impact on the Far East. However, he believes that the Soviet Union's actions, no matter what, will not affect China's resistance to Japan, and he said that if the Soviet Union and Japan can truly strive for peace, China will welcome the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. Dr. Yen also stated that he intends to visit Secretary of State Hull, or even call on President Roosevelt, but there is no other meaning besides expressing respect. At the same time, during his stay here, his only task is to attend the Pacific Relations Conference and discuss the Philippine issue. Yen claimed that many Filipinos hope that the United States will not abandon the Philippines. He also said that he made a brief stop in Mumbai and saw that the Indians had a bad impression of the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland, so India lost a lot of sympathy for the Soviet Union. Therefore, he believes that it is difficult for the Soviet Union to expand its influence in India. Regarding the U.S. Neutrality Act, Yen said that China is quite uneasy about this. What China needs is for the United States to truly cut off the supply of arms to the aggressor country. China's current resistance is for independence, for survival, and for justice. However, China is extremely grateful for the sympathy of the democratic countries, especially the United States, and hopes that the United States' sympathy can be translated into concrete assistance as soon as possible.

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations: The Sticking Point is the Silver Deposit Issue</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable Japanese sources, the reason why the Sino-British-Japanese negotiations stalled again last week was still the issue of Chinese silver deposits in the British concession in Tianjin. During the continued negotiations between British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kensuke Horiuchi, the latter insisted on handing over 14 million silver dollars deposited by the Chinese government in the Bank of Communications in the British concession in Tianjin, otherwise refusing to discuss the resolution of the Tianjin issue. Horiuchi also stated that this money was intended to relieve the flood disaster in North China. However, according to observations from diplomatic circles of third countries with interests in China other than Britain, Japan seems to be trying to force Britain and Germany to abandon their concessions in Tianjin. As for the Shanghai International Settlement, because it is related to the United States and other countries, Japan will inevitably take more cautious action in this regard. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>London: The diplomatic correspondent of The Times learned that the negotiations on various British-Japanese issues caused by the Japanese army occupying several provinces of China are currently still suspended. The Japanese government is clearly waiting for the effective establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime, placing its hopes on this. However, the regime does not seem to be able to be realized in the short term, because the leaders of the Japanese military are opposed to Wang's desire to include North China in the territory under the jurisdiction of the new regime. In addition to not wanting to cede North China, Wang also demanded the right to financial independence, which the supporters of Wang did not want to grant either. As for the National Government, it seems to be exaggerating its recent military victories somewhat, but there is no doubt that its spirit of resistance remains very strong. It is also worth noting that the heavy financial burden Japan has suffered due to the war has not eased at all. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Toward the United States Suddenly Softens</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Former Japanese Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara (currently a member of the House of Peers) issued a statement today, stating that he believes the Japanese government is deeply aware of the seriousness of the US problem and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will do its best to adjust Japan-US relations. We must know that if Japan-US relations are not improved by small means, they will inevitably deteriorate, which is something Japan must avoid. At the same time, the Pacific Association, mainly composed of Shidehara, Abe, and others, also published an article, praising the frankness of the speech by US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, and expressing gratitude to Grew for conveying the opinions and views of the American public. What should also be noted by the US is that during the course of the war, the special rights and interests of the United States in China have sometimes not been fully implemented. It also said that the Japanese government is now doing its best to promote the establishment of the Wang Jingwei government. Once Japan's policy toward China is somewhat clear, Foreign Minister Nomura will engage in negotiations on US-Japan relations with US Ambassador Grew. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Australian Commonwealth Assists Britain in Building Warships</h3>
<p>Sydney: Australian Prime Minister Menzies announced today that in addition to expanding Australia's naval construction program, the Federal Government has also proposed to the British government that it is willing to build warships on its behalf. It is said that the Australian government will employ fast and strong merchant ships, fully arm them, so that they can cope with enemy armed merchant ships and destroyers. Some of these merchant ships will be supplied to the Australian Navy, and the other part will be used by the British Navy, totaling sixty merchant ships, which will be equipped with defensive gun emplacements. The Australian Navy currently has a total of 10,000 personnel. Menzies also stated that the 20,000 men of the second batch of Australian Imperial Forces decided to be recruited by the Australian government will be sent overseas after training. In addition to already ordering 100 Lockheed aircraft from the United States, Australia will soon be able to manufacture six Wirraway aircraft per week. The government has also ordered a large number of aircraft for training purposes. Menzies concluded by saying that the armament expansion program includes accelerating the establishment of a Bren gun manufacturing plant. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>March of Wartime Europe (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in London, Shudi</p>
<p>Therefore, the focus of the problem is: How can the Polish military force of about 1.5 million be resolved quickly?</p>
<p>Does Germany believe that it can resolve the Polish military force in a short period of time? Judging from the tone of some German publications recently, it probably believes so. According to the opinions of these authors, the war, from the beginning, focuses on strategic victory, rather than haggling over a certain area or a certain battle, in order to determine the overall situation of success or failure in the short term, making long-term Polish resistance impossible. Judging from the actual progress of the war in the past few days, Germany is following this path; however, whether the future can be as expected by Germany remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<p>In this stage, Germany's biggest concerns are two things: first, Italy's sudden capture by Britain, France, and Russia; and second, changes in Poland's internal political structure and cooperation with the Soviet Union. These are two distant crises, and at present, they are of course completely impossible. However, if the German-Polish war drags on for a long time, then this gradually has the danger of becoming possible. Because of this, Germany has to make the greatest determination and use the greatest strength to quickly resolve Poland.</p>
<p>If Germany really resolves Poland, and quickly, then what are its next intentions? There is no doubt that in the West, it will brew an armistice with Britain and France; in the East, after plundering all the Polish machinery, raw materials, and stocks, it will annex the industrial area of Upper Silesia in its western part. As for the relationship with Soviet Russia, it will still retain a buffer zone.</p>
<p>This stage can be given a name, which is: "Winning by Fighting Poland."</p>
<p>After winning by fighting Poland, if Britain and France still refuse to make peace, then German diplomacy will have failed again. And the problem placed in front of Germany will be further expanded and become more serious. The realization of this situation, judging from the methods and courage of the current authorities in Britain and France, is probably very possible. If so, then Hitler still has to continue to make his case to the following.</p>
<p>Hitler is very aware of this level, so he is also preparing his countermeasures.</p>
<p>The first point of this countermeasure, without a doubt, is to take advantage of the slight difference in the tasks of Britain and France as naval powers and land powers, to try his best to befriend France, on the one hand, coercing it with the hopelessness of French land warfare against Germany, and on the other hand, persuading it with Germany's lack of ambition towards France. In this way, he calculates that he can shake France's will to fight and relax the solidarity of Britain and France. At the same time, he is conducting secret diplomacy with Britain, helping the revival of the diplomacy of reactionary elements.</p>
<p>If peace brewing fails, then the "war" must continue.</p>
<p>In the war against Britain and France at this time, if the attacks of Britain and France are not very serious, then Germany will adopt a defensive posture on the one hand, closing its doors to build a navy, and then come out to compete with Britain and France at sea; on the other hand, it will intensify its activities in Southeastern Europe, the Near East, and Africa. Germany calculates that if this drags on, the ones who will cry out in pain first must be Britain and France, not Germany. Goering once said: "Everything that Britain and France use is money; Germany, on the other hand, only uses manpower." Indeed, under the current mobilization situation of Britain and France, large-scale consumption is really difficult to maintain for a long time without any intention, just to maintain the situation of war. This point is a huge advantage for a German-style country where there is no big difference between wartime and peacetime.</p>
<p>What if the offensive of Britain and France is serious? (Hitler calculates that it will not be) Then Germany will probably fight back; but there is a big prerequisite, that is, the participation of Italy and Spain in the war, and at the same time, it will make a gesture of further cooperation with the Soviet Union. If that is the case, then the situation will be particularly serious.</p>
<p>In that case, at a certain moment, the United States will definitely and must participate in the war. Under the circumstances of the United States participating in the war, Hitler's last card is to simply truly cooperate with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the eve of using troops against Poland, Hitler shouted in an impassioned tone: "I tell you: Germany will never sign a second 'Treaty of Versailles!'"</p>
<p>These days, judging from Germany's actions in various aspects, probably, the unspoken commentary on the first sentence is now gradually being spoken, which is: "Germany is willing to be red."</p>
<p>Germany's "reddening" is, of course, a rather laughable statement at present. However, if Germany is defeated by Britain, France, and other countries in the war, this sentence will immediately become a reality.</p>
<p>After the socialist country of the Soviet Union, plus a socialist country of Germany, the European situation at that time is unimaginable. This makes the heads of the general capitalist imperialist countries have to frown a few more times and fall into deep contemplation when adopting major plans against Germany!</p>
<p>In this way, in turn, Hitler has put a big problem in front of the authorities of Britain and France!</p>
<p>This time Hitler engaged in the Polish adventure, his ambition and determination were so thorough. What is described here is only an outline. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Repeatedly Defeated in Southern Shandong; More Than 100 Casualties in the Mengyin Area; Attempt to Repair the Tai-Zhao Road Encounters Setback</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondent: The Japanese troops in southern Shandong have been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army and are still struggling desperately. Since September 30, the Japanese troops in Linyi have divided into two groups, totaling six or seven hundred men, one along the Linmeng Highway, passing through Shuanghouji, and the other crossing the river at Madizi, passing through Zhuman. The Japanese troops in Feixian, four hundred men, crossed the Fang River in several groups, passing through Xuezhuang. The Japanese troops in Mengyin, more than two hundred men, passed through Taoxu and Dazhuang. The above groups launched attacks on the Chinese army simultaneously. At the same time, two or three hundred Japanese troops in Mengyin were stationed north of Dazhuang as sniper units. The Chinese army detected the Japanese army's intentions in advance, so it moved south along Mount Meng and took strict surveillance of the Japanese army. The Japanese army failed to make a sneak attack. A part of the Japanese army, about three or four hundred men, went out of Baimayu Pass through Zijingguan, went to Guodong via Mount Meng, and attempted to intercept the Chinese army. Another group of Japanese troops, three or four hundred men, moved from Baimayu and came into contact with a certain division of the Chinese army's rear guard near Liujiacun Baimaguan. After the unit's roundabout cover, the Japanese army was repelled at Baimaguan. In this battle, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed. In early October, more than 500 Japanese troops in Mengyin advanced east along the Xinmeng Highway and came into contact with a certain unit 40 li north of Mengyin. Although the Japanese army launched several fierce attacks, they all failed. At dusk, the Japanese army, under the cover of artillery fire, attempted to occupy the high ground on the left flank of the Chinese army. The Chinese army waited for them to approach and launched a fierce flanking attack. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and was finally repelled by the Chinese army. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese army also suffered more than 30 casualties. The Japanese troops who came to aid were eventually intercepted and driven back. In this decisive battle in southern Shandong, the Chinese army achieved satisfactory results. More than 150 Japanese and puppet troops in Taierzhuang, together with the Japanese troops who crossed the Grand Canal from Taierzhuang, attempted to build a branch road from Taier to Zhao. At 9 pm on October 17, they reappeared in Huanjilou Township, about eight li north of Chefushan, and forced the local people to build earthworks. Upon receiving the report, Guo Xiaxuan, the county magistrate of Tongshan, immediately dispatched the Fourth Brigade of Guo Zimin's unit and Zhang Yuantai's unit, with more than 400 troops, to set off in two directions to meet the enemy. At 2 pm, they came into contact with the Japanese army about two li south of Banlou. After fierce fighting until 5:30 pm, the Japanese and puppet troops were defeated and fled to Taierzhuang. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and pursued them to Yanglou Village, south of Taierzhuang, and returned only after dark. In this battle, a total of 18 Japanese and puppet troops were killed and 14 were wounded. The Chinese army lost four non-commissioned officers and eight soldiers, and four were wounded. Four Type 38 rifles and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. The Japanese troops in Yixian County are again reinforcing Taierzhuang, and the momentum will be even fiercer. This area is at the junction of Qi and Si and is more than 20 li away from the border of Tong. The Jiangsu provincial authorities have telegraphed Wang Huayun, the county magistrate of Pi, to continue to destroy the railway, so that the Japanese army cannot repair the Longhai Railway and the Tai-Zhao branch road.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education: Key Points for Improving Provincial and County Education; Province Divided into Five Normal School Districts; Various Education Funds Guaranteed to be Independent</h3>
<p>(Lishui News) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has put forward ten key points for improving Zhejiang education in order to rectify education throughout the province. These are as follows: (1) The province is divided into five normal school districts, each district having a normal school. The number of classes is increased according to the needs of teachers in each county in the normal school district. The senior high school normal school courses and simple normal school classes in the original provincial high schools are respectively transferred to the normal schools for management. (2) The principals of county-run elementary schools in each county are trained centrally by the province in districts. Teachers of county-run elementary schools and principals and teachers of district, township, and private elementary schools and short-term elementary schools and mass schools are trained centrally by the county in phases and batches, and regulations are stipulated for the in-service training methods for teachers and staff of all levels of schools every semester. (5) Normal school graduates are assigned to serve in various counties by the Department of Education in a unified manner and treated equally. Those in poor counties whose teachers' salaries cannot reach the prescribed standards may be subsidized by provincial funds. (4) The salaries of elementary school teachers in each county are graded according to qualifications and experience, and all are increased, and implemented from the 29th year. (5) The education funds of each county (excluding the provincial allocation) should be stipulated to account for 25% of the total county funds as a minimum limit. The funds of district, township, and town elementary schools should be increased as much as possible by the district education fund production association or sponsorship committee or the district, township, and town offices. The funds of private elementary schools should be planned by the board of directors and their independence guaranteed in accordance with central laws and regulations. The province and the county jointly plan to open up new sources of taxation to increase education funds, and request the central government to allocate the income tax to the province and county in accordance with the current fixed percentage to be fully used for education funds. (6) The county-run high schools in each county are restricted or merged according to the education funding situation of each county and the management of each school. (8) The section chief of the county education section should be appointed by those who meet the prescribed qualifications, and should not be removed arbitrarily. The number of supervisors and staff should be determined according to the complexity of the county's education affairs, and a detailed list of staff quotas will be stipulated by the Department of Education. The school board assistants and school board assistants should be given salaries and office expenses, which should be paid from the county administrative expenses. (9) In addition to the education undertakings in the guerrilla areas that are directly managed by the province, high and junior high school supplementary schools should be set up extensively in various counties to widely accommodate students who have lost their schooling in the war zones. Those set up by the county itself should be subsidized by provincial funds as much as possible, and treated better than those in the rear. If teaching materials cannot be purchased, they will be issued by the province. (10) The Zhejiang West Administrative Office has set up a Guerrilla Area Education Supervision Office, which is organized by the Department of Education selecting three to five supervisors to inspect education in various counties in the guerrilla area.</p>
<h3>Review and Prospects of Mass Education Centers (4)</h3>
<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>Future Improvements and Enrichment: During the Anti-Japanese War, the work of mobilizing the masses should be vigorously promoted, and it is especially urgent to raise national consciousness and enhance anti-war sentiment. The Mass Education Center is the central organization for mass education undertakings and work in a district or county, and it is even more necessary to improve and enrich it. Now, I will excerpt from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education's General Situation of Sichuan Social Education from the 25th to the 27th years, the points that it intends to start rectifying for mass education centers:</p>
<p>(1) The organization should be sound. Each county mass education center should be ordered to comply with the prescribed organization and methods, and complete the filing procedures as soon as possible. (2) Expand the scope of work. Mass education centers must take the initiative to contact various social education institutions in the county and jointly seek the promotion of mass education. (3) Formulate a plan. At the beginning of the year, mass education centers should formulate a central work plan based on past work conditions and the needs of the time and place, and implement it within a time limit. At the end of the year, a detailed report on the implementation process and results should be made for assessment and improvement. (4) Carefully select talents. Select talented mass education cadres and send them to various counties to preside over or guide. When there is a lack of staff, methods should be found to train them, and detailed methods for the assessment, supervision, rewards, and punishments of mass education workers should be formulated as soon as possible. (5) Raise more funds. Raise as much funding as possible for mass education centers to ensure that there is no lack of funding for mass education undertakings. (6) Complete equipment. Set equipment standards for mass education centers in various counties and cities. (7) Order local governments. Local officials should list the mobilization and promotion of mass education center work as one of the performance evaluations. The above points can give a glimpse of the improvements and enrichment that mass education centers should make. In order to enable mass education centers in various places to have a common goal, uniform organization, and concrete work, the Ministry of Education promulgated various regulations related to mass education centers this year. Recently, the Ministry of Education, together with the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education's Third District Special Office, etc., has directly guided the improvement of mass education centers in the third district of Sichuan Province and Chongqing City, where the Ministry of Education is located, as models for various places. In addition to directly assisting the mass education centers in the third district of Sichuan Province, the Ministry of Education is also working to reorganize and expand mass education centers in various places. Among them, the main ones are the following:</p>
<p>(1) Increase Social Education Funds. It has long been stipulated by the central government that social education funds should account for 10% to 20% of the original education funds. In the new education funds, at least 30% should be for provinces and cities, and 30% to 50% should be for counties and cities. Some places comply with this, but many still do not meet the standard. It is planned to reissue the previous order and complete it within a time limit, and use a part of the social education funds exclusively for reorganizing and expanding mass education centers.</p>
<p>(2) Effectively Train Talents. The training of social education talents is extremely important. The Ministry of Education has successively held training classes for electro-optical education personnel, training classes for mass education cadres, training classes for music instructors, and seminars for school personnel concurrently handling social education. Recently, it is planned to hold training classes for mass education center directors, drawing directors of mass education centers from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces in phases to improve work efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) Formulate Equipment Standards. The equipment of mass education centers in various places has never had prescribed standards, resulting in simplicity and wastefulness. The Ministry of Education is now hiring experts to draft equipment standards for mass education centers separately, and dividing the standards into two types, A and B. Type A is suitable for those with a regular budget of more than 5,000 yuan, and Type B is suitable for those with a regular budget of less than 5,000 yuan. It will be promulgated soon.</p>
<p>(4) Publish Guidance Series. The Ministry of Education is now working on compiling a series of social education guidance books. Mass Education Centers is one of the series. There are detailed instructions on the establishment, development, direction, goals, organization, funding, construction, equipment, and work progress of mass education centers. In the future, it is planned to edit small implementation series for mass education centers. All teaching undertakings, guidance facts, livelihood education, and artistic education should have concrete guidance on methods.</p>
<p>(5) Compile Various Teaching Materials. Social education teaching materials should also be deeply noted by those engaged in mass education centers. The Ministry of Education is currently compiling popular mass readings, new and old scripts, lyrics, physical models, specimens, film scripts, and slides in large quantities to meet the practical needs of promoting mass education in various places.</p>
<p>(6) Strictly Implement the Guidance System. Mass education centers themselves should be responsible for guiding social education. This has been clearly stipulated in the regulations. The Ministry of Education has assigned supervisors to conduct on-site inspections and guidance on the progress of social education in various places. In the future, it is hoped that education administrative organs at all levels will pay full attention to and effectively promote the supervisory work.</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, those who implement mass education must start from the real and difficult lives of the masses, and serve, struggle, and sacrifice with the most sincere sincerity to strive for national survival. The Mass Education Center is the most reasonable place for us to engage in mass education. We should step up our efforts. One point of effort will surely have one point of harvest. Let us work hard to transform mass education into a grassroots organization and driving force for resisting Japan and building the country. (The End)</p>

<h3>Finland Declares: Determined Not to Abandon the World Games, Must Be Held Under Any Circumstances; US Takeover Still Difficult to Decide</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, doubts have arisen as to whether the 12th World Olympic Games, scheduled to be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, next year, will be held on schedule. The United States has already expressed willingness to take over if Finland abandons the games. Yesterday, this newspaper received a notice from the Finnish World Games Organizing Committee, strongly denying rumors that Finland would abandon the 12th World Games. The notice stated: "Since the change in the international situation, there have been rumors in various countries that Finland is preparing to abandon the 1940 Olympic Games. The organizing committee would like to take this opportunity to make three points: (1) All external rumors are false. (2) Preparations have not stopped. (3) The games will be held under any circumstances. The Finnish government has expressed its strong support, and the Helsinki City Council also passed a resolution on September 13 that preparations should continue. Currently, all the facilities for the games, except for the swimming pool, have been completed and are ready for use. The swimming pool and the Olympic Village will be completed next spring. All the major and minor events have been scheduled, and the competition rules and management regulations have also been drafted and notified to various organizations. Many of the prime seats have been paid for and the funds transferred to Finland."</p>
<p>As for the United States taking over, according to New York news, this will only be discussed if Finland expresses willingness to abandon the games. Since Finland has expressed its determination, a decision may be difficult to make in the short term.</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Banks Most Aggressive Sellers; Exchange Rate Market Hovering with a Loosening Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The black market trend for the British pound and US dollar was loose, and the situation was ordinary. Most people were calm and watching. However, Hong Kong banks were still selling aggressively, but there was no significant reaction between buying and selling. Throughout the day, the opening rates were flat. After the Hong Kong Electric Company (Hong Kong Bank) initially offered to sell, speculators also offered shillings. Then, due to the strong intention to supply from the American Bank Chase (National City Bank), the price quickly rose to 5 and 1/8 pence at 15.625 and 8.59375 yuan. However, after the Jewish merchant George Joseph, who had sold on the previous day, suddenly came to cover his position for profit, the price once softened. The selling price of the British Gold Bank immediately retreated to 5 and 1/8 pence at 09.375 and 8.5 yuan for the US dollar. Later, due to the Hong Kong Electric Company's renewed offering, and the Japanese banks Sumitomo also selling, the price hardened again. From then on, it loosened directly to 5 and 1/4 pence at 21.875 and 8.6875 yuan, which was the closing price and the strongest rate. Along the way, the Hong Kong Electric Company and the American Bank Chase continued to sell, while the Jardine Matheson (纱花) Bank absorbed some. As for futures trading, it has gradually become more active, and there are many new positions being opened. Overall, trading was somewhat thin.</p>
<p>George Joseph Covering Short Positions for Profit</p>
<p>In the morning, the London large bill was close to 125 in the long term, the New York silver price did not change, and the London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British pound to US dollar to French franc remained flat. The British pound to Shanghai dollar fell by 0.0625. The US dollar to British pound rose by 0.125, to Shanghai dollar by 0.05, and to French franc by 0.125. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks' opening selling prices for spot currencies in the morning were 5 and 1/8 pence at 06.25 for British gold and 8.4375 yuan for the US dollar, with no gain or loss compared to the previous close. After the opening, the Hong Kong Electric Company came to sell, and speculators also sold shillings. In addition, the American Bank Chase and others showed intention to supply, causing the market to loosen. It is estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company and speculators sold spot British gold to foreign banks for 5 and 1/8 pence at 109.375 and 156.25, and then the Hong Kong Electric Company and a certain bank of Chase sold spot US dollars to foreign banks, Jardine Matheson, and Chinese merchants for 8.5 yuan and 59.375. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax also showed no rise or fall. After that, the Jewish merchant George Joseph suddenly covered his position for profit, so the situation softened for a while. It is estimated that George Joseph bought spot British gold for the current month from foreign banks for 5 and 1/8 pence at 125. Later, the spot selling price was called by foreign banks as tight as 5 and 1/8 pence at 09.375 and 8.5 yuan. Then, the Hong Kong Electric Company came to sell again, and the Japanese banks Zhengjin and Sumitomo also came to sell, so the situation hardened again. It is estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company sold spot British gold to foreign banks such as HSBC and Jardine Matheson for 5 and 1/8 pence at 156.25 and 187.5, and the Japanese bank sold spot US dollars to foreign banks for 8.5625 yuan and 625. It was already noon. The banks' closing selling prices for spot currencies at noon were 5 and 1/8 pence at 156.25 for British gold and 8.59375 yuan for the US dollar, which was 09.375 lower for the British pound and 0.15625 higher for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>American and Japanese Merchants Continue to Sell</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, the Hong Kong Electric Company continued to sell, and the American bank still regretted its intention to supply. Although Jardine Matheson slightly absorbed some, its position still felt abundant, so the situation continued to loosen. It is estimated that the Hong Kong Electric Company and the American bank successively sold spot British gold to Jardine Matheson and foreign banks for 5 and 1/8 pence at 187.5 and 218.75, and spot US dollars for 8.625 yuan and 687.5. By the late close, the banks' selling prices for spot currencies were 5 and 1/4 pence at 287.5 for British gold and 8.6875 yuan for the US dollar, 5 and 1/8 pence at 203.125 for British gold for the current month, and 8.65625 yuan for the US dollar for the US dollar. As a result, the spot British pound was 0.15625 lower and the US dollar was 0.25 higher compared to the previous day. The British pound for the current month was 0.171875 longer and the US dollar was 0.28125 cheaper.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Regretful; Although Hong Kong Banks Are Buying in Small Amounts, What Can Be Done Against High Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash blistered red (烚赤) black market situation continued to fall miserably, regretfully, because the market lacked good news. Conversely, 19 out of 10 short sellers profited. It was also heard that the gold price in Tianjin was higher than that in this city, exceeding the cost of transportation, with a difference as large as 300 yuan. Therefore, merchants from Tianjin have been continuously bringing gold to Shanghai to sell, which is naturally considerable, so the number of chips has increased invisibly. Although Hong Kong banks are constantly buying in small amounts, their positions are still abundant. Moreover, retail investors are bound to sell at high prices, and foreign exchange is reported to be both loose and hard, making it difficult for the market price to support itself for a while. The morning opening plummeted by 30 yuan, to 3,660 yuan. Later, due to the Hong Kong banks' good appetite and the retail investors' joining in, it once rebounded by 20 yuan. However, securities firms immediately sold and pressed down the price. Later, due to the exchange market once reporting softness, people's hearts could not help but be shaken, and the price rose to 3,685 yuan. However, the lowest price of 3,640 yuan was seen until the afternoon, and the closing price was still 3,640 yuan, because foreign exchange softened again. The trading throughout the day was still strong, about 1,000 taels. The jewelry gold hung low by 5 yuan, and the customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Another Fall of 46 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial situation of each bar (10 taels) was still scattered and weak. Then, hearing that the foreign exchange market was hardening, people's morale was even more discouraged. A certain gold shop, acting on behalf of a speculator, first pressed down the price and sold, and the opening fell sharply by 30 yuan. The gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,660 yuan. Shortly after, the Hong Kong banks took advantage of the low price to pull in, and at the same time, retail investors followed suit, rising by 20 yuan. A money exchange firm entered 10 taels to a gold shop for 3,680 yuan. Later, because securities firms took the opportunity to sell, and because foreign exchange was still trending weakly, the price could not support itself and fell. The securities firms sold 30 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,652 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange suddenly returned to softness, and people's hearts were shaken, and the market situation turned around. A certain money exchange firm strongly absorbed more than 200 taels, rebounding by 33 yuan. The money exchange firm entered 30 taels to a silver shop firm for 3,685 yuan. After that, the exchange market returned to looseness, the retail selling wind rose again, and the silver shop firms were also eager to sell short, and the market situation once again fell by 20 yuan. The money exchange firms traded 30 taels with each other for 3,665 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was quite stable. First, the securities firms traded 30 taels with each other for 3,668 yuan. Then, because a certain gold shop sold on behalf of its customers, the price fell slightly by 13 yuan. The money exchange firm entered 20 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,655 yuan. At that time, a certain securities firm covered its short position for profit, pulling up the price by 12 yuan. The securities firm entered 20 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,667 yuan. After entering, due to the hardening of foreign exchange, fewer people entered. In addition, the silver shop firms and a certain gold shop sold and stuffed each other, and the price fell by 27 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 10 taels to the securities firm for 3,640 yuan. Near the closing, a certain silver shop bought cheaply, pulling up the price by 4 yuan. A certain silver shop entered 20 taels to its counterpart for 3,644 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by 46 yuan compared to the previous day. The fluctuation throughout the day was 45 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher compared to the blistered red, and the purchase price had to be reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current margin gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Hangs Low by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael was initially still 375 yuan for the Da Tong Hang. By 10:18 AM, it was reduced by 5 yuan, and there were no changes after that. As a result, the Da Tong Hang changed to 370 yuan, which was the same as the price of the Xin Tong Hang. The purchase price was reduced by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Market Prices Deteriorating Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the increasing supply of foreign exchange and the weakness of the blistered red, the demand for British and American gold pounds was very rare, and the supply of British and American gold notes was very smooth, gradually declining. The US dollar note fell by as much as 11 yuan and 6 jiao (角) in the evening market. The Hong Kong note followed the decline due to the abundant supply of Hong Kong exchange. The supply of Singapore and Dutch notes increased, and the Canadian and Philippine notes loosened and fell with the US dollar note. The Japanese gold note was weak first and then rebounded, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 li (厘). The demand for Korean won was enthusiastic, with the evening market at 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Yesterday's market prices were: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold note fell by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, US dollar note fell by 0.32 yuan, Hong Kong note fell by 0.05 yuan, French franc note fell by 0.005 yuan, and Singapore, Dutch, Canadian, and Philippine notes all fell by 0.1 yuan. Other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Rates Continue to Shrink</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rediscount rate for bills of exchange hovered low, initially still around 39 yuan per 1,000 yuan, and then fell to 35 yuan. Near noon, it began to rebound, to 37.5 yuan. In the afternoon, it stood still at the original price, still 37.5 yuan. It was reduced again by 1.5 yuan. The interbank interest rate of the Money Exchange Association was still posted at 0.15 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, without change.</p>
<h3>Securities: Sino-French Bonds Soar by Nine Pounds; Domestic Debt Market Fluctuates; Foreign Stock Purchases Increase Without Decrease</h3>
<p>London, 1st: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts continued to rise sharply, with upper-tier bonds rising by 3 to 9 pounds and lower-tier bonds also rising by 1 to 3 pounds. Among the upper-tier bonds, Sino-French US dollars jumped by 9 pounds, with the asking price at 14 pounds. Reorganization (British Issued) rose by 7 pounds, with the price at 35 pounds. Anglo-German Continuation (British Issued) and Anglo-French (British Issued) each rose by 5 pounds, with the former at 47 pounds and the latter at 38 pounds. Vickers Aircraft rose by 4 pounds, to 12 pounds. Crisp rose by 3 pounds, to 23 pounds. Among the lower-tier bonds, except for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds, which remained stable, the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Beijing-Ningbo bonds each rose by 3 pounds, with the former at 13 pounds and the latter at 50 pounds. The Longhai Railway rose by 3 pounds to 12 pounds, and the rest rose by 1 pound each, all at 13 pounds. Overall, the tariff and Boxer indemnity guaranteed bonds in the upper tier rose the most sharply, followed by salt tax bonds, and then railway bonds.</p>
<p>Yesterday's black market situation for securities was quite volatile, but the changes were not due to attacks from unfavorable external factors, but only because the bulls had lost contact, which was taken advantage of by the bears. London foreign government bonds rose greatly again, continuing to be as high as 5 to 9 pounds, causing people's hearts to flicker and sink. During this incubation period, the bond market's fluctuation could not be avoided. However, its trend should still be a curved upward climb. Yesterday, in the morning, because Hong Kang and Shun Kang continued to buy, the initial opening was raised by 6 to 7 jiao, and the Class E father almost approached the 50 yuan mark. Only because many retail bulls took the opportunity to emerge, the market price gradually declined. Class C fell back close to the 9 yuan mark. Tong Shun and others also sold quite a bit. In the afternoon, the situation felt even weaker. Da Tong, Mao Tai, and retail investors sold successively. The market still declined gradually due to too few buyers. Class C re-entered the 9 yuan mark. People's hearts were weak, completely based on the friction between bulls and bears. As a result, the market price rebounded by 0.03 to 0.045 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Public Trading Place Report: Yesterday's stock market was potentially strong all day, and several prices reached new highs. In the morning, many floating bulls cut and settled, but when the market opened in the afternoon, due to the appearance of new accounts, various stocks rose to their peak under the tide of public purchases. When profit-takers competed to emerge, the closing price fell slightly, but the trend was still extremely strong. The trust company stocks and the Rui Rong stocks were the most noticeable. The interest in rubber stocks was also more intense. The Lange Zhi stock opened at a high record of 25 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 1st: Today, the listed market prices of Far East British companies' stocks also rose steadily. The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (麥加利銀行) stock rose by 5 shillings, with the price at 8 pounds even. The Hong Kong registered stock of HSBC rose by 3 pounds, and the British registered stock rose by 5 pounds, with the price at 82 pounds even. The Mercantile Bank of India stock rose by 5 shillings, with the price at 11 pounds and 5 shillings. The unlisted stock of the Kailan Mining Administration rose by another 1 shilling, with the price at 17 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Stable; Heard That the Assembly Place Will Be Relocated</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, hovering on a horizontal line. The ups and downs throughout the day are only between 5 yuan. Currently, most market sentiment is optimistic, because the Guangdong banks have been stagnant for a long time. Although there is no large-scale transaction development, retail business continues uninterrupted, so stability is seen step by step. There is also a saying that the stocks of various factories have been accumulating for a long time, and spot goods are gradually increasing, with the intention of opening sales. However, in this mixed market of soft and hard, it is difficult to deal with. The exchange rate is also on a wandering path. Based on the above situation, it is greatly between advancing and retreating, and there is a deep fear of circling for a long time. However, some hand goods are unwilling to sacrifice and settle due to excessive losses, so the market holds on step by step.</p>
<p>At the morning opening of current yarn, the Hong Kong banks were in a scattered mood, without any appearance of handling goods, and the opening price fell by 5 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 650 yuan. Later, because the thinking of counterparts was firm, there were some buyers, and the price rose again by several yuan to 655 yuan. The trend was very flat with ups and downs of 1 to 2 yuan in the middle. The half-day transaction statistics were 1,337 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse was flat, with little difference from the previous day. Only Tian Nu rose by 6 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 4 yuan. The factory opened 50 bales of 20-count special Jin Cheng from Yong'an Factory, with the price at 658 yuan. Yesterday, 785 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 182 pieces were shipped to Yantai, 115 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong today, and 26 pieces will be shipped to Saigon. The amount purchased by each bank is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 385 Counterparts 480 Xiamen 65</p>

<p>Wenzhou 25 Total 1,337</p>
<p>Another News: The new address of the Yarn Industry Association assembly place, after moving to the east building on the second floor of the New World on the Great Racecourse Road, is not suitable for customers and some counterparts due to the location, and there is no telephone to communicate news, so they are unwilling to participate, and separation has turned into two assembly points. Since Someone has realized that this situation is not a fundamental solution, it is now heard that they are making every effort to start a new operation, roughly recruiting at the former Dun Yu Qianzhuang store address in Tonghe Lane, Beijing Road, Ningbo Road. The house price there is very high, increasing membership fees for all counterparts to compensate. If there are no changes in the future, it should be a reality in the near future.</p>
<h3>Cotton Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Another News: In Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, due to the loosening of exchange rates recently, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market situation began to loosen slightly yesterday. Counterparts believe that the inventory of fine yarn in Shanghai is thin, so they have begun to order. Japanese manufacturers are also slightly moving, all for immediate loading. The possibility of a turnaround in US cotton trading in the future.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market, the cotton market was very firm in the morning due to a good telegram from Liverpool. Later, because the US government's audit institute expressed dissatisfaction with the current cotton industry loan and the handling of surplus cotton, it caused the public to sell, and the market situation suddenly appeared weak. As a result, the closing price fell by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. In the Indian cotton market, although trading opened due to opposition to the resignation of the two provincial governors, there was no market price. Egyptian cotton rose by 35 pounds. Liverpool fell back by 0.03 pence at the closing.</p>
<h3>Local Indian Cotton Merchants Boycott Linbalili Cotton</h3>
<p>The British newspaper North China Daily News recently published that all Indian cotton merchants in this port boycotted Linbalili cotton. According to Linbalili is a small city in India, producing a large amount of cotton annually, and selling it to all parts of India. Recently, the son of the leader, Datasaihai and Jiajisaihai, robbed women, causing public outrage. All cotton weavers and exporters in India have risen to boycott. The Linbalili authorities are now amending the law to consign to Hong Kong, but it has been opposed by Hong Kong Indian cotton merchants. Even Japanese cotton merchants are boycotting this cotton. It is reliably known that there are 532 bales of Linbalili cotton that will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and local Indian cotton merchants have set about boycotting.</p>
<p>The current cotton trading is still sustainable, but large-scale transactions are still lacking, so people's hearts have no gain or loss. Japanese domestic and foreign factories enter 10 pieces of white packaged cotton, and other factories have very little vitality. Chinese factories have not adopted any single package. As for buying and selling among counterparts, it feels even more slow, so the cotton market is also trending fixed. It is necessary to wait for the yarn market to rise before there is hope of progress. Subei source, 1,180 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, 700 bales of Changyinsha, and 540 bales from Beisha. Today, 205 bales are shipped to Hong Kong, and 26 bales are shipped to Siam. The current cotton sales are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Tongzhou cotton 130.00-131.00 Counterparts Enter 800 bales Banknote Stack Delivery</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 121.50-122.00 Another 600 bales Again Again</p>
<p>Changyinsha Packed 137.00 Domestic and Foreign Factories Enter 1,000 pieces Again Factory Delivery</p>
<h3>Provisions: Rice</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Declined Across the Board for Both Japonica and Indica</p>
<p>The Dumi rice market presented a fluctuating situation, with both booms and busts, and unpredictability. Recently, the situation for domestic rice has been unusually complex. Regarding the source alone, it seems manipulated by some party. Exporting is sometimes smooth and sometimes obstructed. With transportation not free, it is difficult to grasp the arrival of goods. In addition, areas like Jing and Wu have entered a state of control by some party. Common hoarding households profit from this. It is hard to compare this with the stable and firm scenes of the past. Therefore, the market often changes unpredictably, causing both retailers and wholesalers, and even generally stable players, to be wary, adopting a policy of steady and sure steps, rarely taking risks or speculating. Yesterday, local stores mostly bought only to meet immediate needs, and otherwise stood by and watched. The opening market in the morning showed some vitality, with traders shouting for higher prices, but the sales market quickly weakened, showing stagnation instead. Those holding goods, wanting to sell them, had to follow the wind and lower prices to entice buyers. As a result, new Japonica and new thin rice such as "Lüjiaozhong Baige," suffered from slow sales and large inventories, with prices falling by 22-33 cents compared to the previous day. Broken Japonica and old-new converted rice also showed a softening trend. The total source for the entire market was more than 20 truckloads of goods from Sujia, Taikun, and Fengqing. Statistics showed only 5-6 thousand bags traded.</p>
<p>Additional news (Indica): Although Japanese merchants released some Indica yesterday, demand from rural areas inland was very strong. Inland brokers took away over 2,000 bags, so the market was not initially affected by Japonica prices. Then, Japanese merchants dumped Wu Indica, combined with a large dump of new Japonica and Lu tip rice. Market prices began to be suppressed by 12-22 cents. (Imported Rice): Yesterday, Daofu Foreign Company sold 1,500 bags of old Saigon rice from the Taikoo Warehouse for only 28.5 yuan, equivalent to only 23 yuan per stone. It was suppressed by local Indica, resulting in this low price. (Japonica Rice): Yesterday, except for the unloading of Chang Japonica being blocked and disappearing, other routes had some deliveries. Initially, Chang brokers held firm and were in demand, but then Japanese merchants dumped 6-7 thousand bags of new Japonica and Lu tip rice from the Kunshan area, each bag containing 1.3 dou of rice. New Japonica was only 25.8-26 yuan, Lu tip rice was 22.5-22.8 yuan. These were absorbed by brokerages, and the market was brought down.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Rise Another 20 Cents: Flour Not to Be Underestimated</h3>
<p>Flour: Both the northern and southern merchants engaged in small-scale transactions. Northern merchants, in addition to purchasing artillery and naval vessel flour, also procured #4 and #5 flour. Nanyang's demand for Tianzhu flour also continued. Due to the high price of raw materials, factories remained firm in their selling intentions. The supply of returned goods was scarce. The market was secretly strong. The base price for #2 flour continued to open at 7.4 yuan, with customer prices requiring 7.5-7.6 yuan. Over 40,000 bags were traded in the entire market. The base price was still stable and not to be underestimated in the short term.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading was not brisk, with both arrivals and sales low. Because sources were repeatedly obstructed and imported wheat was difficult to clear, sellers naturally held firm. However, factories, unwilling to purchase much due to high prices, only bought over 3,000 bags of Changxi and other wheat, and hoarding households pulled in 5 truckloads of Suzhou, Kunshan, and Chuzhou wheat at a price of 11.3-11.5 yuan, up about 20 cents.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports: Yesterday, 500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin and 5,000 bags to Tanggu. 1,350 bags of beans were shipped to Yantai, while 350 bags were shipped from Beisha. Today, there are still 3,000 bags of flour, 2,575 bags of beans, 100 bags of raw peanuts, and 150 pieces of raw oil to be shipped to Hong Kong, and 30 pieces to Siam.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquette Market Price Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>Coal briquette prices, which rose repeatedly last month due to raw material shortages, have now stabilized as Hongji coal dust arrives steadily and is stockpiled in large quantities. People's confidence has stabilized, and prices have returned to normal. Common outside hoarding households are also emerging. Warehouse bills are 66 yuan, delivered by fellow traders. Large factory goods are 69 yuan per ton, wholesale to customers with a small commission. Retail at shops is around 3.6-3.7 yuan per zu (100 market catties).</p>

<p>The misery after a couple's discord! Don't let hidden ailments, like moths, steal your future and happiness!</p>
<p>There are many couples who, on the surface, look no different from other ordinary couples. But under the observation of sharp eyes, whether in the wrinkles on their faces or in the attitude of their words and actions, one can see that they have a kind of hidden worry buried in their hearts, constantly eroding their bodies and minds, stealing their youth, and plunging into the miserable state of life!</p>
<p>In principle, a healthy couple, enjoying joy from morning till night, immersed in the atmosphere of love, giving birth to clever children, and organizing a happy family, is bound to be extremely happy! Why do they have hidden worries and fall into misery? According to medical judgment, most of the reasons lie in the man's early masturbation, spermatorrhea, or post-marital licentiousness, which consumes too much of the reproductive gland fluid, resulting in symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, disordered dreams, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging. Such a sick husband, even if he has a beautiful wife, constantly shows hypocrisy and incompetence in the life of love, or even completely unable to perform sexually. How can this not arouse the wife's hatred? When wild geese fly south and they watch the years go by, not only is her heart filled with sadness; but when the husband thinks that he is an upstanding man, why should he fail her and become a sinner in love, his eyes fill with tears, and he probably has to turn his back and shed tears in secret! As for tragedies such as elopement, divorce, suicide, and murder resulting from marital discord, they are countless in today's society!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the foundation of a couple is love, and the foundation of love is sexual health. A clever man will definitely understand this principle deeply. He will always make plans to improve his health. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" is the most cost-effective and reliable way to improve health. This preparation is made by extracting the reproductive gland essence from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs, and using scientific concentration and replication methods. The ingredients are completely effective and the quality is infinitely valuable. Taking it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood within one day and night. It is especially valuable to take continuously, which can also help development and nourish the nerves. Those without illness can gain weight in a short period of time, prolong life, and those with the above symptoms can definitely cure various diseases and return to youth. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Himitotts Gujing Pian" to stop leakage, which will be more effective!</p>
<p>Patient Ren Baiming, from Anhui, 26 years old, a businessman. Early marriage caused injury, resulting in kidney deficiency and brain weakness, combined with spermatorrhea. Three years after marriage, they have never had children, and the couple's relationship is like ice and coal. He came to this clinic for treatment last month. After observing his symptoms, I immediately instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" and "Himitotts Gujing Pian" at Huamei Pharmacy and take them together without interruption for more than a month. New therapies such as electrotherapy injections were also applied, and he really recovered his perfect health. The couple's love has deepened, and it is said that there are signs of a promising son.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Deteriorated Spermatorrhea Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</h3>
<p>A disease with no pain or itching is often the most severe disease. We can prove this by taking the nocturnal emission of young people as an example. Ignorant young people, due to the impulse of curiosity or the temptation of a bad environment, often commit masturbation habits or early marriage and licentiousness. One must know that these inappropriate sexual behaviors are most likely to damage the sexual nerves, loosen the sperm gate, and lead to terrible spermatorrhea. However, ignorant young people do not know the terror of spermatorrhea, or think that spermatorrhea is painless, and let it go on for years, or although they know that spermatorrhea is harmful, they still delay treatment. As a result, the symptoms worsen, and some go from mild nocturnal emission to severe spermatorrhea and leakage; and some, due to sperm depletion and blood exhaustion, develop brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and other symptoms. If this kind of young person is studying at school, their studies will plummet, or they may even be unable to graduate! If they are working in the business world, they will suffer from being unable to cope due to lack of energy, or even lose their jobs! If they want to fall in love, they are often abandoned by women due to their unattractive appearance and fall into the misery of unrequited love! If they are already married, it is even more difficult for the couple to enjoy marital bliss, and various tragedies constantly arise in the family! The misery after the deterioration of spermatorrhea is simply indescribable! Early treatment of spermatorrhea is easy, but one must not take miscellaneous drugs such as "spermatorrhea pills" indiscriminately, as there is also the possibility of delaying the disease. If you take the world's only holy medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Himitotts Gujing Pian," it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and achieve the magical effect of inducing sleep and stopping spermatorrhea. If the condition has deteriorated and there are the above symptoms, in addition to continuing to actively take "Himitotts Gujing Pian," you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (available at major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou) to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, and help development. Continuous use will definitely cure various diseases in the short term and make the body healthier. However, if patients can come to this clinic in person and receive electrotherapy injections and other methods, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Beauty: Transforming the Breasts in Winter is the Fundamental Method</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Because the season is approaching winter, when we open the newspaper, what catches our eye, in addition to various tonic advertisements from Chinese medicine stores, are also no shortage of western medicine tonic injections, tonic pills, and ginseng and bird's nest shops' official bird's nests, white fungus, etc. These tonics certainly have their own strengths, which we will not discuss, but what I want to discuss today is the only effective tonic for women that has been overlooked and rarely advertised, and has been produced under the development of science and the flourishing of medicine.</p>
<p>Speaking of women's tonics, perhaps some will say: Aren't women's tonics also flooding the market, dazzling people? This is certainly true. But I want to ask: Among women's tonics, in addition to drugs that regulate menstruation, invigorate appetite, and clear leucorrhea, are there any special drugs that can adjust the various endocrine glands in the body, develop the breasts, and transform the entire health and beauty of women? If so, it is only "Shengzhisu," a reproductive gland and ovarian endocrine preparation for women invented by German physiology master Dr. Stanner. The so-called beauty and health of women, and whether the effect of taking tonics is achieved, only depends on their pair of breasts. If the breasts are high and the nipples are erect, the hips are plump, and the curves are clear, then not only will men be captivated by her, but when she goes out and socializes, she is like a flower that is both gorgeous and fragrant. Everyone hopes to get close to her fragrance and feels fortunate for three lifetimes. As for health, it can also be seen at a glance that the ovarian function is sound and the metabolism is vigorous. As for the effectiveness of taking the drug, it can be judged by whether the withered breasts are raised. This has been recognized by famous Chinese and foreign doctors throughout history, and is not comparable to hearsay. However, after taking female "Shengzhihu," they have all been able to achieve their wishes in the short term. The ingredients of female "Shengzhihu" are ovarian hormones, pituitary gland, liver paste, pancreas, and minerals such as phosphorus, calcium, and iron extracted from male and fierce animals, and precisely refined under purple light rays. Therefore, the medicinal properties are exceptionally peaceful and the effects are exceptionally great. If taken continuously during the winter storage period, not only will menstruation be regulated, complexion will be rosy, and skin will be smooth and greasy, without fear of roughness, cracks, or cold, but also the withered breasts can be raised day by day. By the time the coming spring arrives, the magnificent state of their height cannot be described in words. At this time, those who take it are surprised and sigh that it is indeed the truth for women.</p>

<h3>Western District's Proposal Submitted to the Puppet Government The Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies its Position</h3>
<p>Merely Negotiating Temporary Applicable Measures</p>
<p>Not Establishing a Permanent Agreement with the Puppet Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a public announcement yesterday stating: "Yesterday (2nd) afternoon, the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Council visited the 'Mayor' Chuan Xiao'an and submitted the Council's recommendations regarding police power on extra-settlement roads in the Western District. To avoid misunderstandings, it must be stated that the Council's intention is not to establish a permanent agreement to resolve the issue of extra-settlement roads, but merely to negotiate temporary applicable measures to stop friction between the two sides and ensure the maintenance of order."</p>
<p>What the Shanghai Municipal Council submitted to the puppet "Municipal Government" yesterday was only the first bundle of the specific plan, the police issue portion. The Chairman, F.C. Jones, and Secretary-General, Philip, personally brought it to the "Municipal Government" in the city center at 4:30 PM yesterday and handed it over to the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. Jones and Philip intend to first agree with Chuan on a temporary agreement regarding police power, so as to resolve all recent disputes and guarantee the restoration of law and order in the extra-settlement road area, and then discuss donations, taxes, and other issues. The Shanghai Municipal Council has maintained absolute silence on the state of yesterday's talks, making it impossible to obtain information. However, it was learned from reliable sources last night that the official negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet "Mayor" have been decided to begin early next week. Because the puppet "Mayor" cannot act alone at this time, he will first discuss the contents of the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan with the Japanese side. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Continental News published a commentary the day before yesterday, titled "The Shanghai Municipal Council Should Be More Transparent," stating that any solution to the issue of extra-settlement roads must be in cooperation with the Japanese side. The words threatened the Shanghai Municipal Council extremely and criticized the Shanghai Municipal Council for not having Japanese directors participate in the discussion when drafting the plan.</p>
<p>Chinese Directors Never Participated in Opinions</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the shooting incident near Columbia Road on Tuesday night (1st). Yesterday (1st), it was heard that the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council have accelerated the date of submitting the proposal to "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an to resolve the dispute over extra-settlement roads. The Council remains silent on the contents of the proposal. However, it is heard that the Council directors and the consular corps here are still continuing to consider the contents of the proposal. It is also heard that the Council meeting yesterday did not discuss this matter at all, because if the discussion of the proposal was on the agenda, the Chinese and Japanese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council would be very hesitant. It was heard from the Chinese side yesterday that the Chinese directors have not participated in the discussion of the proposal so far. When reporters went to inquire, they did not express definite opinions. However, it is heard that if this matter is handed over to the Chinese directors for discussion, they will definitely oppose it due to their special status.</p>
<p>French Newspaper Reports Japanese News</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 2nd that, according to Japanese sources, representatives of the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" can negotiate this afternoon (2nd) to resolve the issue of extra-settlement roads. According to the Japanese side, the scope of this negotiation should include the expenses of road construction and drainage, the maintenance of public utilities, the rectification of taxes, and other issues. That is, all the issues previously raised by the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" to the Shanghai Municipal Council will be discussed. As far as the Japanese side knows, on October 22, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, F.C. Jones, and the "Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government," Chuan Xiao'an, held a negotiation once at the Japanese Consulate General's Office. At that time, it was already discovered that the negotiation of this issue had a great possibility of being resolved.</p>
<p>Chief Patrol Yorke Denounces Rumors</p>
<p>The English Great American Evening News reported that Chief Patrol Yorke of the Police Department today (2nd) not only completely denied the rumor spread by the Tongmeng News Agency that the Police Department and the "Special Municipal Government" police had an incident on Columbia Road yesterday (1st) and that it was resolved after Yorke admitted that it was a mistake of the Police Department, but also said that the news was extremely absurd. The Tongmeng News Agency's news that Yorke was responsible for the "D" area is also inaccurate, because the "D" area is located in Yangshupu, while Yorke is responsible for the "B" area in western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Unified Public Debt, Type D, Fixed-Term Lottery Redemption</h3>
<p>Total principal and interest of five public debts amounts to over 56 million yuan</p>
<p>The eighth lottery redemption of the Unified Public Debt. The winning numbers for Types A, B, and C have all been drawn. Type D is scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month. The branch has notified the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry association to send representatives to monitor the process. The lottery for Type E is scheduled to be held on December 10. For all five types above, discounting and payment will begin at the end of January next year. The total redemption amount is 14.35 million yuan, and the interest payment is 41.9456 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes to be Printed by Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Total amount remains 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>To be distributed through industry associations</p>
<p>After the Central Bank, pursuant to an order from the Ministry of Finance, issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, the first batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued. In view of the current high demand in the market, it has been decided to issue another 500,000 yuan. The head office has ordered the Hong Kong office to sign a continued printing contract with the American Yongning Company. Printing is already being rushed. Once printing is completed, it will be handed over to the Shanghai branch for issuance. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the second batch of fractional currency notes includes 200,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 300,000 yuan in five-cent notes. The style is exactly the same as the first batch. The contract stipulates that the goods must be delivered 20 days after the signing of the contract, which is approximately completed by the 15th of this month. The notes will be delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank in batches for gradual issuance. In order to promote widespread circulation, it has been decided to improve the issuance method and entrust the industry associations to distribute the notes to their member firms. It is heard that the industry associations have already begun registering for the collection of fractional currency notes. After the second batch of fractional currency notes is issued, they will be collected from the Central Bank and distributed to the member firms for use. As for the value coupons previously issued by the firms, they have been given a deadline to withdraw them themselves. The issuance of tokens by the concession tram company has also been suspended.</p>
<h3>After Tension Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, Japanese Military Trains Arrive One After Another</h3>
<p>Passenger trains "rest," Japanese troops head west</p>
<p>Japanese troops retreat from Xitang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<p>Guerrilla areas in Punan restore to original state</p>
<p>The situation in various towns along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been extremely tense in the past two or three days. Kidnappings have occurred along the way in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places for days. The 12:40 passenger train from Shanghai to Nanjing the day before yesterday (1st) was temporarily suspended, and a powder sign was hung with the words "13:40 train, rest today." Therefore, rumors arose one after another, some saying that the railway was under special martial law, and others saying that trains would be suspended and traffic would be cut off.</p>
<p>Su took a steam car back to Shanghai. The car passed through Weiting, Zhengyi, Kunshan, Nanxiang, and other stations, and Japanese troops were seen allowing troop trains departing from Shanghai to pass. There were four such trains. However, the Japanese military police boarded the steam car and pulled down the window curtains, not allowing passengers to look out the window. There were many passengers in the car, and women and children were all panicked.</p>
<p>No Pedestrians Along the Road</p>
<p>The various townships of Xin Zhuang, Mei Long, and other places in the suburbs of Shanghai have been implementing martial law and conducting strict inspections for days due to the Japanese military's troop movements. Villagers approaching the railway line are often shot. Therefore, the small roads near the railway have been almost deserted and unusually desolate. It is also heard that the plainclothes team formerly in the Guanshengyuan Farm, whose name was "People's Peace Self-Defense Corps," numbering about a hundred people, was led by Tao Mou the day before yesterday and patrolled the town with the Japanese military police team. Now, posts are stationed at the main intersections of the Shanghai-Min Road to protect and defend.</p>
<p>Chasing Japanese Troops in Xitang</p>
<p>After the Japanese military police garrison at Fengjing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was surrounded by Chinese regular troops and two foreign-style bridges on the railway were destroyed, the Japanese troops destroyed Xitang Town. Now, according to continuous news obtained from the navigation industry, the Japanese troops entrenched in Xitang, after being engaged by the Chinese 30th Division, were driven back to Jiaxing. The Chinese troops intercepted them section by section along the way, abandoning many corpses and weapons, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Team Moved</p>
<p>Punan is the base area for guerrilla teams. Previously, due to the puppet "Fengxian County Administration Chief" Xu Chao (i.e., Xu Zijiang) leading Japanese troops to occupy Nanquan Town and recruiting salt smugglers and local ruffians in the name of the already executed puppet "Deputy Commander of the 3rd District Pacification," Li Tianmin, the guerrilla team suffered greatly in the past three months. In addition, with Yu Tao Sheng Lai Shanghai, Zhang Fan shaking, only Ding Xu Gu Xi four units hard to engage, located in the sea corner, most of them moved towards Shanghai-Hangzhou Road and Su-Jia Road. However, now the Commander of the 3rd War Zone specially selected the entire old Independent 45th Brigade (now expanded into a division, divided into three brigades: 33rd, 35th, and 37th), and the 62nd Division, first occupied the entire Zhapu and Pinghu (except for the city walls), driving out the Japanese troops and reaching Punan directly. As far as the military order reached, Zhang Huifang, Li Wenyuan, Xu Zhifei, and Zhang Miaogen's units were all affected. The Japanese troops retreated one after another. Therefore, the two corridors of Pudong and Shangchuan Road, the Shangnan Road area, and the Duxing Zhagang Tangkou opposite Minhang, the guerrilla team has restored its original strength.</p>
<h3>Japanese "Hengchan Company" Encircled the General Public</h3>
<p>Owners Do Not Pay Attention</p>
<p>Digging Soil and Bombing Workers to Death</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Hengchan Company," established with Japanese investment, first started operating real estate business, arbitrarily encircling civilian land in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas to build houses for profit. This method of trading empty and buying empty is being actively promoted, and countless original landowners will lose their property rights one after another. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Only Debt Certificates Paid for State-Owned and Civilian Land</p>
<p>A person named Xu Tingsheng had four or five mu of land in a certain place in northern Shanghai. Because the land was located in an important location, it was coveted by the Hengchan Company. The company erected fences around the land and circled it for use, and was about to build houses. After hearing about it, Xu tried to negotiate with the company, unwilling to sell. Unexpectedly, Hirai, a Japanese section chief of the Hengchan Company, arbitrarily assessed the value of the land at 5,364.4 yuan, ordering Xu to first take 364.4 yuan in cash, and pay 5,000 yuan in a blank non-cashable debt certificate. Xu was extremely angry and refused to accept both the cash and the debt certificate, entrusting the ownership of his inherent land to fate.</p>
<p>Building Houses and Artillery Wounds People</p>
<p>The Hengchan Company also encircled more than ten mu of farmland in the name of a certain surname near the "Dadao Municipal Government" in the city center, surrounded it with fences, and hired many coolies for days, preparing the ground in order to start building houses. At noon the day before yesterday, three coolies dug up a shell in the swamp on the land, touched the mechanism, and suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, the surrounding areas were shaken. The "Dadao Municipal Government" Chuan Xiao'an and other people were suspected of causing trouble and were greatly panicked. It was not until the cause was found out that they could breathe a sigh of relief. When the shell exploded, two coolies were bombed to death on the spot, and another coolie had a leg blown off. After being sent to the Fumin Hospital run by the Japanese in Hongkou for treatment, he died of breathlessness yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>EUROPEAN ARMISTICE ANNIVERSARY - THIS YEAR, DIM AND COLORLESS</h3>
<p>Shanghai British Community to Hold Simple Ceremony</p>
<p>Donations to be Collected to Aid Soldiers' Families</p>
<p>With the Second World War erupting following the deterioration of relations between Germany and Poland, and both sides exchanging heavy artillery fire, the British community in Shanghai will hold the "European Armistice Anniversary" on the [blank]th of this month. Given the extraordinary times, this year's remembrance ceremony will be somewhat restrained. At 8:30 AM on that day, led by Mr. Aitken, Chairman of the British Victory Association, a wreath made of poppy flowers will be presented to the</p>
<p>Goddess of Peace</p>
<p>on the Bund. Members of the association and other British expatriates wishing to participate can wear their medals or awards and gather at the statue of the Goddess of Peace at 8:10 AM. The ceremony is said to be very simple. At 10:45 AM, a meeting will be held at the British Church at 219 Jiujiang Road, presided over by the Reverend Chatfield. At 11:00 AM sharp, there will be three minutes of silence, followed by a performance by the pipe band of the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. All British expatriates wishing to participate are welcome; however, seating will not be reserved. After the ceremony, participants are asked to make a donation to support the British Victory Association. The traditional meal for British veterans will reportedly be canceled this year. The open</p>
<p>sale of poppy flowers</p>
<p>on the streets to the general public will also be discontinued this year. If British expatriates need these flowers or wish to give them to friends, they can obtain them free of charge from the British Victory Association on Jiujiang Road before next Tuesday. Special poppy flowers for decorating cars or display tables can also be obtained from the association. Wreaths for car decoration will be exhibited on the 11th, as usual. Those who want them need not pay, but a small donation is required to help the families of those who sacrificed their lives in the war who are living in Shanghai. It is said that these poppy wreaths, although distributed by the association, come from London, England, and are worth several times more than those in Shanghai. Therefore, charitable donations will also be increased. On the day of the Armistice Remembrance, the British Victory Association will urge all British expatriates to wear wreaths throughout the day to commemorate the honored souls of the war dead.</p>

<h3>JAPANESE WARSHIP SHELLS LONGSHAN</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, on the morning of the 29th, at 9:00 AM, a Japanese warship sailed to the Longshan sea area, which belongs to Zhenhai County, and continuously fired at the shore, with as many as 27 shells. The damage was minimal. After shelling, the Japanese warship immediately sailed to the [blank] port sea area outside Zhenhai and anchored. The Zhenhai Fortress has been monitoring it. The Longshan pier was thoroughly destroyed by the stationed army last winter.</p>
<h3>HSBC ABSORBS FOREIGN EXCHANGE - MARKET REMAINS STEADY</h3>
<p>Showing Stability of Public Sentiment, Contrary to Past Practice</p>
<p>Hong Kong Capital Flows to Shanghai, Strengthening Foreign Exchange Reserves</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange, it has been manipulated by speculators, resulting in unprecedentedly low exchange rates. Now, thanks to the government's successful control of trade, imported goods are scarce, and exports of domestic goods have increased. The Hong Kong government's implementation of wartime commercial controls has caused capital from Hong Kong to flow to Shanghai. At the same time, exporters in Shanghai are selling the foreign exchange they earn to the black market, and importers in Shanghai are continuously selling the foreign exchange they earn to the black market. Hong Kong speculators' consistently aggressive buying has caused the black market for foreign exchange to ease unprecedentedly. HSBC Bank's listings have been repeatedly lengthened, and the price of the Chinese yuan in Shanghai has risen invisibly. Those operating long positions are discouraged and helpless, and every day, suppliers flood the market. Small-scale foreign exchange hoarders are numerous. Confidence in the Chinese yuan arises spontaneously, further contributing to its strength. Last week, HSBC Bank tried to buy British foreign exchange, purchasing a considerable amount at 4 and 625/1000 pence, but it had no effect on the market. In the past, the market was always alarmed whenever HSBC intervened, and sellers immediately retreated. Now, this is not the case, which shows how much the market psychology has changed. As for remittances from overseas Chinese, in the past, they were remitted to Hong Kong, but now, due to Hong Kong's controls, the remittances are rerouted to Shanghai, and funds are flowing into Shanghai.</p>
<h3>WINTER WIND SEASON - DIFFICULTIES WITH BARGE TRANSPORT IN ZHENHAI</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, the number of barges in Zhenhai had gradually increased to more than 100 a month ago. Each ship was unloading in sequence, which was sufficient to manage. However, as the season has entered late autumn, the area outside the Zhenhai port is an area with many islands. Every autumn rain season, northwesterly winds blow from all directions, and the wind is very strong. As barges have limited load capacity, they cannot sail outside the port when it is windy. Therefore, in the past month, barge unloading has often stopped due to the wind, causing voyages to be significantly delayed. Currently, shipping companies are jointly discussing ways to improve the situation, so that voyages are not affected by the winter wind season.</p>
<h3>PATROL DUTIES AT THE THREE FLOATING WHARVES TRANSFERRED TO THE WATER POLICE</h3>
<p>Solely Responsible for Boat and Ship Issues at the Wharves</p>
<p>Police Investigations Still Under the Jurisdiction of the Police Department</p>
<p>—All Cases to Be Tried by the Special Court—</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, from yesterday (the 1st), the Water Police took over the patrol duties of the 9th, 10th, and 11th floating wharves in front of the Customs wharf from the Police Department. However, the scope of activities of both parties will not be affected by this patrol duty. Police investigations matters occurring on the floating wharves themselves will be handled by the Police Department, while issues concerning boats and ships moored near the wharves will be managed by the Water Police. All cases, whether in the river or on the wharves, will continue to be tried by the Special District Court. Since the landing places along the Bund have been restricted, and there are many boats and ships requesting temporary mooring, the Water Police had previously limited small boats wanting to pick up passengers on the Bund to ten minutes. However, many small boats moored for longer than the time limit. Therefore, it is more convenient if the police officers of the Water Police, who are responsible for boats and ships, patrol the floating wharves.</p>
<h3>STREET FLOODING SITUATION THIS YEAR</h3>
<p>The Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek Have Been Neglected for Too Long</p>
<p>The City's Ground Level Is Also Gradually Declining</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks Ways to Improve</p>
<p>In recent years, several parts of the concession south of the Suzhou Creek have often been flooded, causing inconvenience to pedestrians and vehicles. The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has prepared a dredging plan and submitted it to the Public Works Committee for review. The reasons for street flooding can be summarized in two points: one is high river levels, and the other is excessive rainfall. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>High River Levels</p>
<p>The flooding caused by the rising water of the Suzhou Creek has a profound impact on areas close to the Huangpu River or the Suzhou Creek, especially the area between Henan Road and the Bund, and near the three major companies on Nanjing Road. Several parts of the northern district are also slightly affected. The Public Works Department began to reconstruct the Lixia Road between Henan Road and the Bund several years ago, raising the road surface. However, due to the high cost and obstruction of traffic, the reconstruction project was suspended in 1936. However, the manholes in the area have been fitted with valves to prevent backflow of river water, and a seawall has been built along the Bund. The Public Works Department has also installed a pump to drain the water when the manholes are blocked. These measures cost little but have a great effect. The ten flood-prevention measures have been implemented two or three times this year, with five times not being fully effective. Of these five times, four were due to excessive rainfall, which exceeded the pumping capacity. The other time occurred on the night of August 19th. That day, the river water was about four feet above the ground at midnight, but by 8:00 AM the next morning, it had all receded. On the 17th of last month, the river water was about one foot above the lowest part of the concession, but thanks to the appropriate measures taken by the Public Works Department, the concession was not affected. The ground around the three major companies on Nanjing Road is low, so tidal water easily flows through the drains to the ground. The remedy is to install spherical valves on the drains. However, during high tide, if there is too much rainwater or water pouring into the drains, the streets will flood and it will be difficult to drain. The Public Works Department has now introduced a method to drain the street water to the nearest drain pumping station and has installed a special pump for use. Several parts of the northern district are sometimes affected by tidal water. To remedy this, the drain openings have been fitted with spherical valves.</p>
<p>Excessive Rainfall</p>
<p>The city's ground level is low, and street flooding is inevitable if there is several inches of rain within a few hours. In the past two years, the flooded area has become wider and the duration longer. The reason for this is that the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek have not been dredged for a long time, and the city's ground level is also declining. The western district's boundary roads have seen a sudden development of industry, which is not controlled by the Public Works Department, and the drainage outlets of the French Concession (which are connected to the drains of the Public Concession on Avenue Foch) are not easily maintained in perfect condition. In June of last year, there was a heavy rain, the amount of which was the highest since 1875. The chief engineer of the French Concession's municipal authority, in light of the situation at the time, drafted a plan. This plan requires larger water pipes and several large-scale pumping stations. If its scope is extended to all parts south of the Suzhou Creek, up to the railway line, it will require an investment of 60 million yuan and take at least ten years to complete. The current measures taken by the Public Works Department cannot completely prevent street flooding when there is excessive rainfall, but they do reduce its depth, width, and duration. The western district and the roads outside the western district are most affected by rainwater. These areas lack proper drainage facilities, and in recent years, many ponds and river channels have been filled to create small plots of land, so the outlet for rainwater is reduced. The roads on the border of the concession's western section are therefore often flooded. The area of the roads outside the western district is not much different from that of the concession, so its impact is clear. Although there has not been as much rain in the past two years as there was in June of last year, the western district is continuing to develop, and the number of uncontrolled buildings is increasing. The Public Works Department believes that it is necessary to improve the drainage facilities as much as possible, but the cost should be as economical as possible. As for all the existing drains, in addition to being cleaned at all times, the Public Works Department has paid special attention to them. The department has hired an additional engineer and an assistant to specialize in drainage matters. It has also added equipment to quickly remove silt from the drains. The amount of sludge removed from the manholes used to be about 20 tons per month, but since the installation of the above equipment, it has increased to 600 tons. All the main drains in the areas that are most easily flooded were quite clean this summer. At the beginning of this year, a new large drain was laid on Avenue Grande Occidentale (from Rue Amiral Bayle to Columbia Road). Recently, a new water pipe has been laid on Columbia Road to drain the floodwater from Rue Annam to the Fa Hua Creek. Another water pipe has also been laid to drain the floodwater from the lower part of Route Tenant de la Tour to the large water pipe on Avenue Haig. The lowest part of Route Cardinal Mercier, about 1,500 feet, is being rebuilt. These measures have been effective, but it is still difficult to prevent street flooding when there is excessive rainfall. Currently, residents of the western district often feel inconvenienced by street flooding after heavy rains. This shortcoming must be remedied by thoroughly renovating the drains. A more convenient method is to directly connect the drain water to the Suzhou Creek, but the area between the border of the concession and the railway line is large, and some parts of the road surface must be raised, which will cost as much as 800,000 yuan. Moreover, before this plan can be implemented, the relevant authorities must allow cooperation. At the same time, the Public Works Department must find ways to prevent the flooding in the western district from spilling into the concession, otherwise it will be useless.</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting and carefully considered all the facts regarding the above-mentioned plans. As a result, it was decided to recommend to the council that it take all possible measures within reasonable limits next year. As for the plans that should not be held at present, the above recommendations have been approved by the council. Thereafter, the routine work of the Public Works Department will continue. The pumping system can eliminate the floodwater in the western district. After the improvements, the drainage volume has increased by about 100,000 gallons per hour. In addition, there are other measures that can significantly improve the situation in the western district if there is excessive rainfall.</p>

<h3>ARMED ROBBERY AT A COTTON CLOTH SHOP ON ZILAI STREET - DETECTIVES AND ROBBERS FIGHT - ONE ROBBER KILLED AND FOUR CAPTURED</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, an armed robbery and shooting occurred in the French Concession on Zilai Street. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Equipped with a Burglar Alarm</p>
<p>Wang Huiming, from Suzhou, runs the Jinchang Shenji Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 14, Lane 43 (Shenxing Lane), Zilai Street, French Concession. Tang Guozhu, from Pudong, serves as the manager. The shop is equipped with a burglar alarm connected to No. 17 next door and then to the French police station, for security against burglaries.</p>
<p>Robbery in the Early Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, shortly after the shop staff got up, seven robbers, armed with a Mauser pistol and a handgun, broke into the shop, confined everyone, and proceeded to rob it. They took over a thousand yuan in cash from the desk. At that moment, the shop manager secretly pressed the burglar alarm. The police station received the alert and immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to search and arrest the robbers.</p>
<p>Resisting Arrest with Gunfire</p>
<p>The detectives, led by Chinese Detective Dai Rongji and including Detectives Zhang Dongcheng, Ni Jinrong, and Chen Fusheng, arrived at the shop to apprehend the robbers. As the detectives were about to enter, the robbers came out. Seeing the detectives arriving, they opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives returned fire. More than ten shots were fired in total. As a result, one of the robbers, Yang Da'yan from Jiangbei, was shot in the leg while trying to climb the wall to escape and fell to the ground, where he was captured.</p>
<p>Netting the Entire Gang</p>
<p>In addition, four other robbers were captured on the spot. Over one thousand yuan in stolen cash, a Mauser pistol, and twenty-five rounds of ammunition were confiscated. Two other robbers fled eastward. The detectives chased after them, and one robber was shot and killed at the intersection of Jixiang Street. The remaining robber escaped without a trace. Five robbers, as well as the stolen goods and ammunition, were taken to the police station, to be sent to the Second Special Court today for legal prosecution.</p>
<h3>DANCER ABANDONED - SUES FOR RECOGNITION OF DAUGHTER - DEFENDANT ORDERED TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Xue Meiying, a 24-year-old dancer from Nanjing, was once married but unfortunately lost her husband early. Unable to bear widowhood, she left her marriage and worked as a dancer in Shanghai. Last year, at a dance hall, she met Li Xianglu, a dance patron from Guangdong (currently a comprador at a foreign company), who was in his thirties. They fell in love at first sight and soon began living together. Before long, Xue became pregnant. Li, upon hearing the news, was not only not happy but worried, and he resolutely abandoned Xue, never returning. Xue gave birth to a daughter a few months later. Having been out of work for a long time, she was struggling financially. She hired a lawyer to sue Li in the First Special Court, demanding recognition of the daughter as his own and requesting an order for child support of over 16,000 yuan. Judge Li Humin heard the case several times, summoning relevant witnesses to court and conducting a detailed investigation. Yesterday, the court ruled that the daughter born to the plaintiff was the defendant's biological daughter and ordered the defendant to pay child support of 20 yuan per month. The rest of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed.</p>
<h3>FOREMAN EXTORTS FACTORY OWNER</h3>
<p>The metal manufacturing factory at No. 8, Lane 39, Connaught Road, was founded by Xu Yuan, from Ningbo. The factory employs hundreds of workers. Recently, the factory temporarily suspended work because the orders from the contracted clients had been completed. Wu Ali, a foreman from Wuxi, took the opportunity to extort 400 yuan from the factory owner Xu Yuan as dismissal fees for the workers, causing trouble for Xu. The matter was settled with 50 yuan. However, the money was embezzled by a Mr. Yin, who is on the run. At 5:30 PM on the 24th of last month, Wu Ali gathered a group of over ten people and went to the factory again to demand money from Xu Yuan. He assaulted Xu and threatened to harm Xu if his demands were not met. The case was reported, and the police from Gordon Road arrested Wu Ali and brought him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that Mr. Yin and Wu's accomplices could not be arrested and requested prosecution. When questioned, the defendant insisted that he had not received any of the 50 yuan dismissal fee given by the factory and had resorted to this tactic to seek leniency. Judge Liu sentenced Wu Ali to three months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>MRS. TIAN RUNDE'S MEMORIAL SERVICE</h3>
<p>Mrs. Wang, the first wife of financier Tian Runde, passed away in Shanghai last month. It is reported that the memorial service will be held at the Jingtu Nunnery in Shanghai on the 5th of this month. Mr. Tian has a wide circle of friends, and it is expected that the Gu Ling Road will be bustling with traffic on that day.</p>
<h3>DANCER BURNS HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER - INJURIES VERIFIED - DEFENDANT DETAINED FOR INVESTIGATION</h3>
<p>Chen Meiying (also known as Chen Meibao), a 30-year-old woman from Guangdong, used to work as a dancer. She met and cohabited with YCO, a Filipino musician, at Room 12, Apartment 52, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. Two years ago, she adopted a nine-year-old girl, Chen Sandi. However, Chen was usually violent and often</p>
<p>Beat the Girl</p>
<p>Recently, she escalated her abuse, using cigarette burns on various parts of the girl's hands, legs, face, and ears. Outraged, someone reported the abuse to the police. Detective Ter of the West Police Station and Chinese Detective San Daotou No. 1013 arrested Chen Meiying, along with Chen Sandi, and took them to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baoli, filed a public prosecution for abuse under Article 286 of the Criminal Code and stated the details of the case, saying that after the police received the report, they</p>
<p>Immediately Investigated</p>
<p>They learned that the second landlord was You Laosan, who used the premises as an apartment and rented it out separately. Room 12 was rented by the defendant and a Filipino. At that time, because there were American interests involved, the police did not make an arrest. They contacted the American Consul to confirm that the defendant was still of Chinese nationality and then arrested her. At that time, only the girl Chen Sandi was in the room. She was pale, malnourished, and had cigarette</p>
<p>Burns on Her Face, Ears, Hands, and Legs</p>
<p>Later, they learned that the defendant was gambling at mahjong at No. 25 in the same lane and arrested her there. The defendant admitted to the burns at the police station, but the Filipino was her accomplice and had incited her. Further investigation was needed. He requested that the case be postponed. Judge Xiao Peishen and Prosecutor Song Genshan examined the injuries in court and questioned Chen Sandi, who testified that she was burned three</p>
<p>Times with Cigarettes for Misbehaving. When Chen Meiying was questioned, she admitted that she lived with the Filipino and had adopted Chen Sandi two years ago. She had burned her with cigarettes because she disobeyed and she had a bad temper, but it was only one time. The court ordered the defendant to be detained pending further questioning and postponed the hearing for seven days. The girl was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Swindling for Medicinal Pearls</p>
<p>Li Yuanzhong from Zhenjiang, residing at Room 21, No. 13, Lane 69, Mai Gao Bao Lu Road, French Concession, thirty-eight years old this year, impersonated a wealthy family's servant under the alias Zhu Qi between April and May of this year. He successively defrauded the Hechang Jewelry Store in the Bailao Shopping Mall on Jisi Fei Er Road in Western Shanghai and the Baochang Jewelry Store at No. 308 Tongfu Road of medicinal pearls (研粉吞服, believed to have the effect of nourishing the body and preserving youth), totaling eleven taels, worth 2,700 yuan. He then disappeared without a trace. The case was reported to the French police, requesting investigation and arrest. Just the other day, French detectives discovered Li's whereabouts, apprehended him, and brought him to the Second Special District Court. Judge Wu Kechou conducted the trial. After briefly questioning the defendant's age and origin in court, he ordered a postponement for further questioning on the 9th. The defendant was detained.</p>
<p>Western Woman Drowns Herself</p>
<p>Jane Davis, an American national, nineteen years old, suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River at the Customs Wharf in the Public Concession yesterday morning at around 6:30 AM, attempting suicide. She was rescued by the patrol officers and did not drown. The cause of Miss Davis' suicide is currently under investigation by the police. It is rumored that the young woman is of Spanish nationality and is currently working as a dancer in a dance hall.</p>
<p>Purchasing Counterfeit Goods</p>
<p>Jiang Wu, the wife of the owner of the Dai Chunlin Hujiang Fragrance Powder Store in Huajin Lane, Jiujiang Road, purchased thirty dozens of Peony brand rouge last year. It was discovered afterwards by the Huadong Chemical Industry Company that the Peony brand rouge she purchased was a counterfeit of their product. They immediately reported this to the Lao Zha Police Station, who dispatched detectives to search the premises. More than twenty dozens of the counterfeit goods were confiscated. A petition was then submitted to the First Special District Court to issue a summons. Judge Meng Tingke conducted the trial yesterday morning. After questioning by Judge Meng, a decision was made to await further investigation.</p>
<p>Drugs Found</p>
<p>Zhou Afa from Ningbo, thirty-six years old, used to be a merchant in his hometown. He recently came to Shanghai to purchase goods. The other day at 11:00 AM, he was carrying a wicker basket containing miscellaneous items and walking near the Grand Bell on French Avenue when he was searched by patrol officers. A large bag of morphine was found among the tea leaves in a tea jar inside the basket. A bag of red pills, weighing about one catty, was also found in a dried food jar. He was immediately taken to the police station and escorted to the Second Special District Court for trial yesterday. Due to the need for further investigation, after questioning the defendant, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>Young Woman Commits Theft</p>
<p>Yan Juefei, a young man from Ningbo, twenty-six years old this year, is currently a student at a certain university. He and his wife, Ms. Li (real name Yan Zheng Renqing, twenty-two years old this year), live in the garret on the third floor of No. 26, Lane 280, Route des Soeurs. She is beautiful and fashionable. Guo Cai, a Cantonese woman, forty-four years old, lives in the garret on the second floor. A set of her wedding attire, hanging behind the door in her room, was stolen on the morning of the 30th of last month at 10:00 AM. She immediately reported this to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. The investigation revealed that it was stolen by her neighbor, Yan Li, who pawned it for ten yuan. Li was arrested, and the pawn ticket was found. The stolen goods were retrieved. She was brought to the Second Special District Court yesterday. After questioning by Judge Wu, Li's statements were evasive. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defendant was detained.</p>

<h3>Postal Worker Subsidy Issue Reported to Headquarters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the demand of postal service workers and coolies below for equal subsidies by the Shanghai Postal Administration, after the issue was resolved, the Bureau, in addition to telegraphing a report on the performance of the postal workers to the Ministry of Communications, also sent a detailed report yesterday.

<h3>No Progress in Negotiations for Detained Portuguese Ships</h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiations for the release of more than ten Portuguese merchant ships, including the Tang Qiao Tang Bei Tang Lumei Da Li Bao, a reporter from Daguan News Agency specially inquired with shipping industry yesterday. There is no matter of organizing a Sino-Portuguese shipping company. Regarding the detained Portuguese ships, the Japanese side has repeatedly expressed its willingness to release them, but only on the condition that they register with the pseudo "Maritime Administration Bureau" and cooperate with the Japanese side in operation. The Portuguese merchants are unwilling to accept this and resolutely reject it, resulting in a prolonged delay. However, diplomatic channels are still being used to continue negotiations. However, the Hailong vessel of the Atlantic Shipping Company, which was detained on April 5th of this year along with other Portuguese ships, was released on the 21st of last month. It immediately sailed to the French-owned Quxin Shipyard in Nanshi to enter the dock for inspection of the hull and repair of the machinery. The work has now been completed. On the morning of the day before yesterday (the 1st), it left the dock and sailed back to the buoys at Nos. 29 and 30 Yangshupu, where the deck passenger seats will be repaired and repainted. The routes it will travel after completion are currently undecided. The Hailong is the first of the detained Portuguese vessels to be released, and negotiations for the remaining vessels are still underway.</p>
<h3>Unified Purchase and Sale of Bristles Announced by the Bureau</h3>

<h3>One of the Shanghai Hundred Views The Mysterious Medicinal Plaster Shop A Confession of a Trier</h3>
<p>— Zi Hong</p>
<p>When you are so sick that there is no other way, even the aspiring scholars will pray to the Bodhisattva. My back has been aching for several days and it has not gotten any better. Forcing myself, I barged into that plaster shop I did not believe in. When I saw the tiger skin hanging on the wall, I felt as if I was being sent into the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>Green wine bottles, red plasters, big pythons, and small monkeys, the whole place was filled with the atmosphere of a traveling salesman. The man with the chubby cheeks came up to me and asked about the source of the illness, and patting my stomach, said loudly: "Treat it quickly! Treat it quickly! This is madness."</p>
<p>Inexplicably, a plaster was stuffed into my hand, considered the cheapest price, one yuan. The plaster read "Secretly Made Magical Panacea". The man slapped me on the shoulder, which was really unbearable. It hurt so much that I could hardly breathe, but he grinned and shouted: "Friend, I guarantee it will work, and if it doesn't, I'll refund your money!"</p>
<p>I spent the night in groans, and the mystery did not work, but it hurt so much that it swelled up. Remembering that he said "no charge for additional medicine", I barged in again. Before I could say three words, he acted like a fortune teller, asking me to stretch out my hand to look at, pressed my nails and said: "Your illness is severe and the medicine is light. You should use a refined musk plaster, five yuan each." Then he saw that I didn't look like I was going to buy it, and said again: "Return the old plaster to me, and I'll give you one yuan off. We're honest businessmen, aren't we?"</p>
<p>"Come, I'll give you a few injections and apply some medicine, and I guarantee you'll be completely cured!" As he said this, there was also a patient at the door using a very long needle to stab his leg. I trembled a little. Although he said there would be no charge, I declined and left immediately.</p>
<p>"Then drink some Madness Chasing Medicine Wine, two yuan and forty cents a catty. Internal drinking, external plaster, internal and external response, I guarantee you'll be completely cured!" I admired how many methods he had to guarantee a cure.</p>
<p>I was a little scared when I saw the green wine and red cap. I quickly said: "I don't drink wine."</p>
<p>"You don't drink? You have to drink even if you don't drink when you're sick. I'm not asking you to drink it all in one gulp. You can use it in your dishes or rice. You don't drink?"</p>
<p>"I didn't bring much money."</p>
<p>"How much money did you bring? Buy a little less, six cents okay?"</p>
<p>"You said that if the plaster doesn't work, you'll refund my money. Today you said that the pores open on the first day, the medicine will work on the second day, and it will be completely cured on the third day. Then please add some medicine, and I'll come back to ask for your advice in three days."</p>
<p>"I said how much money did you bring? I said a one yuan plaster is not a panacea. There are good ones: five yuan, ten yuan. I think you should still drink some medicinal wine. How much money did you bring?"</p>
<p>"Only twenty cents! I don't drink wine, is it okay to buy twenty cents?" I said on purpose.</p>
<p>"Okay, I don't want your money!" He pulled a face and shouted, telling me to take off my coat and stand at the door. Surrounded by many onlookers, he shook my arm as if it was nothing, then hooked my arm back and carried me on his back, then grabbed my arm and picked me up as if I were a flat ancestor. I shouted, and the little monkey even tore my clothes. He laughed in public and said: "Young man, you can't stand this little bit of hardship. I guarantee you'll be okay, I won't charge you a penny, go!" He slapped me on the back. I was in so much pain that I couldn't speak, and I slipped away as if I had escaped from the tiger's mouth. I could still hear him say behind me: "Problem, I won't charge you a penny, I guarantee you'll be okay!"</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Learning Field Work, Reporters Enter New Territory, Studying Internal Affairs, Learning to Line Up in the Little Schoolyard</p>
<p>This shows that the genius of a journalist is indeed an important part, and it is also difficult to force it for a while. Miss Shao Huihua was born with journalistic talent. When she was sixteen years old, she was still studying at school, and she could interview important news and run a wall newspaper. She could actually obtain news that others could not. Even if she competed with her classmates to win, to probe into a secret piece of news, it was just for fun, she could also win and be a host. Many classmates said that she had the skills of a detective, and she could be a female detective in the future and contribute to the country. But she did not admit to such words. She said: News investigation cannot be equated with being a detective. Often being a detective or a spy is a kind of secret work, often using cunning means, for an important document, even to the point of coercion and plunder, which is not right. As for collecting news, that is a matter of being upright and upright. The news obtained must be publicized to the public and disclosed to the world. It is really a sacred job. Moreover, being a detective or a spy inevitably has a sense of enemy and me, which exists in between. If it is the work of news investigation, it is not like this. Some news releases must be approved by the other party before they can be disclosed. There is also the fact that a piece of news has a great relationship with timeliness. In addition to talent, it is necessary to talk about cultivation. If you only have talent and do not cultivate it, you will often be misled by talent, and even go astray, which is very dangerous. But what is the method of cultivation? This question is too big! To put it simply, morality is a circle drawn for talented people. No matter how talented you are, you cannot jump out of the circle of morality. Naturally, a person always has a sense of justice. If talent jumps out of the scope of justice, that talent will cause trouble. The key is common sense. How to say that common sense is rich and common sense is shallow, this is progressing with the times. Common sense is like the capital of a capitalist. In the past, this little bit of capital was already enough, but in today's world, this little bit of capital is felt to be insufficient. Because the times are progressing, all kinds of things have become complicated. Originally, the little bit of common sense that I knew felt very rich, but now the things that should be known should be added more. If you don't understand this, and you don't understand that, it will clearly show that you are poor in knowledge. Moreover, a journalist is a large treasure house of common sense. It is really as said in ancient novels: he knows astronomy above, understands geography below, and is proficient in the three teachings and nine streams. It was already necessary to do so in ancient times, let alone in modern times? This is already the case for an ordinary person who stands in society, let alone a journalist? (198)</p>
<h3>Please Pay Attention, Parents</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>It is already late autumn, and the children have all put on their woolen clothes. Accordingly, the swindlers who "peel the frogs" that come with the season have also come on the market. Everyone is also warning parents not to let their children go to the streets. Shanghai's society is full of traps. Swindlers who trick children out of woolen shirts and the like seem to be nothing to write about. For example, the news recently advertised in the newspapers about children being abducted and shipped overseas is even more difficult to prevent. Therefore, the thing I want to ask parents to pay attention to is not to guard against swindlers, but to pay attention to the actions of children on the streets.</p>
<p>Children are active, and keeping them at home is not a good idea, especially in the inch-gold land of the "isolated island". Within the fortress,</p>
<h3>Establishing Grain Storage</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Some time ago, when rice prices soared, which had a serious impact on general social life, everyone seemed to comfort themselves by hoping for smooth sources and thicker stocks. However, the facts proved that the obstacles to the source were not very serious, and the stocks were not thin, but prices still did not fall back, and they hoped for the new grain to come on the market. Now that the new grain has come on the market, rice prices remain the same. In a helpless state, this kind of social fear and worry is especially overflowing in everyone's words.</p>
<p>However, expectations are empty, and fear and worry do not help the facts. Now, the First Special District Citizens' Federation has suggested to the Public Concession Board of Works and the French Concession Board of Directors to collect and transport a large amount of national rice from the producing areas at the time when new grain is coming on the market, and set up public warehouses within the concessions to implement storage for future needs, so that rice prices will continue to fall. The two concession authorities have accepted this suggestion because it is reasonable.</p>
<p>Although this is a stopgap measure, it can prevent future panic if implemented. We try to deduce the future illusion of the time when new grain is on the market and when there is no grain, and after shivering, we naturally hope that it will be realized as soon as possible. At present, the general poor coolies, under the heavy burden of life, are already unable to breathe. For those who rely on labor to live, getting enough to eat in a day is really great luck! Moreover, there are even more people who cannot get enough to eat, who cry to each other with the ox-coat, and who let the social environment control their fate! Their plight is deepening with the passage of time. If rice prices continue to rise, the future miserable situation of the middle and lower classes will be even worse than today. This is unbearable to imagine, right? Therefore, establishing grain storage is an urgent need in a helpless environment.</p>
<p>This method of establishing grain storage, after the planning of the concession authorities, will naturally not be a problem for sufficient funds and large warehouse locations. However, if the quantity is sufficiently expanded, then the method of no-interest investment by citizens may not fail to achieve considerable good results.</p>
<p>Since it is said to be "no interest", why would anyone invest? Are you joking? Actually, no. For example: the competent authority for establishing grain storage collects citizen investment, stipulates that it starts from five yuan or ten yuan, or a certain amount, does not give interest, but gives priority to future flat whips, and in the future, it can receive the amount of rice equal to the amount of the receipt. In the unpredictable evolution of the social environment, in case of a severe stage of rice shortage, investors can be confident (if they hoard themselves, they cannot purchase directly from the producing area, so there is no cheap price). In this way, the enthusiasm for investment is indeed expected, right?</p>
<p>As for public warehouses, if land is purchased and built, it seems that the cost will be increased, and it is more economical to rent various spare warehouses and the like. As for dredging the source, cracking down on hoarding households, monitoring manipulation, etc., it is hoped that they will also be carried out at the same time, so as to achieve a two-pronged harvest.</p>
<p>Seeing children making trouble everywhere, many parents ask them to play in the alleyways or on the streets. Some, as mentioned in an article in this magazine a few days ago, send them to school to "confine the barbarians". Naturally, children born into unfortunate families are ultimately unfortunate. Those who can be sent to school to "confine the barbarians" are at least the lucky ones who can receive education. In fact, letting them out of the small room and getting a larger place to play, which suits their active personality, is not necessarily a good place for those who do not have a garden and do not have the power to send them to kindergarten. But we have to see what they are doing in the alleyways or on the streets? Playing marbles and gambling at candy stalls are good; associating with hooligans and learning various curses and fights are also everywhere. Parents don't know what they do outside every day. Being able to avoid the noise in the house is all they care about. In this way, they sink into a bad environment and get used to all the bad things. They are already unfortunate to be born into such families. Won't they be even more unfortunate in the future and become useless people in society? Therefore, I think it is a problem worth paying attention to not letting children go to the alleyways and street corners, but the educational work of correcting what they do in the alleyways and street corners is even more worthy of attention!</p>

<h3>Wireless Film Advertising</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>We all know that wireless broadcasting has become an advertising tool today. General merchants use wireless broadcasting to promote themselves. They constantly broadcast from the radio station to announce how good the quality of their goods is and how cheap the sale is, as well as the news of big discounts and big sales.</p>
<p>Based on this fact, after the wireless radio and movies become popular, in addition to providing entertainment for people, like wireless radio broadcasting, it will definitely be used by merchants as an advertising tool; and in fact, Hollywood film companies have taken the lead in using wireless movies as an advertising tool for films.</p>
<p>The blockbuster "Gungadin", which was released in Shanghai, used wireless movies as an advertisement in New York and London after it was completed. Paramount has also expressed that from now on, all new films will be advertised by wireless radio throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Because wireless movies are still new, the states in America have not yet imposed commercial control. At the same time, the current notes issued are considered by the authorities to be non-commercial, so whether it is legal is still a question.</p>
<p>The National Broadcasting Company in America plans to promote wireless movie advertising; therefore, it is planning to distribute an extremely small booklet called "Wireless Movie Advertising," preparing to distribute 5,200 copies every week, so that merchants can use sound and images to advertise and promote their goods, and naturally get better results.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Film Circle Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Cui Ping</p>
<p>Cheng Bugao, the famous director now serving in the Political Department of the Military Commission, recently came to Hong Kong on official business and was extremely indignant about the rumors and slanders spread by a certain tabloid in Shanghai about him and Tan Ying. Cheng said, "…I have been working hard for the country, braving danger on the front lines, sacrificing the happiness of my family, all to fulfill my personal responsibility to the country and the nation. Although I do not seek praise from friends, they instead fabricate stories to damage our relationship. In fact, our relationship cannot be destroyed by those rumors, but I always wonder why those who damage me don't use their pens to attack others? Instead, they slander someone who is working for the country."</p>
<p>It is now a fact that Jin Yan and Wang Renmei have accepted an invitation from the Central Film Studio to participate in the filming of "A Thousand Miles of Clear Sky." Jin and Wang left Hong Kong on October 23rd, transiting through Haiphong to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Li Dashen has arrived in Hong Kong with Zhu Qingxian. The cooperation between Xinhua and Nanyue has been materialized. First, they will film "Peerless Beauty" starring Hu Die. Following this film will be "The Oil Peddler Courts the Courtesan." It is not yet determined whether Hu Die will play the "Courtesan" in this film. It is said that at least ten films must be shot in the next year, all of which will be domestically produced. Actors will also be transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong to work. The first batch of those heading south are Lu Luming, Tan Ying, Sun Min, and others.</p>
<p>The news that Hua Huilin will play "Empress Dowager Cixi" has been recorded in this publication. Hong Kong's Nanyang Company has now produced this film, directed by Gao Lihen and starring Li Qinian. However, after filming for only a few days, Gao suffered from hemoptysis due to overwork, and the filming was temporarily suspended. The "Empress Dowager Cixi" filmed by Nanyang is a Cantonese film, while the one Hua plans to film is a Mandarin film, which can be said to be completely unrelated.</p>
<p>Hu Die told people that her current weight is several pounds lighter than when she filmed "Rouge Tears" in the autumn, returning to her average figure. However, she still dares not eat too many nutritious foods.</p>
<p>The Friendship Company, jointly formed by Gu Wuwei and Qian Zao, has not yet officially released its first film "Flower of the Earth" except for a charity screening. The second film has been decided to start filming at the beginning of the month, with the title "The Wang Clan and Qin Hui." The Wang Clan will be played by Lu Cuilan, and Qin Hui may be played by Tang Huaiqiu as a guest role. Members of the China Travel Service's Hong Kong troupe will also participate in the performance.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Mu</p>
<p>The Miraculous Reunion of Wang Yunfang and His Father</p>
<p>Wang Yunfang, an old partner of Kirin Tong, was appreciated by the opera-loving circles for his meticulous acting and generous demeanor when he performed on stages such as the Tianchan in Shanghai a few years ago. However, he was fond of Buddhism by nature. Besides writing and painting at home, he was very fond of studying Buddhism with others. Whenever he met with friends, he always held his rosary and chanted "Amitabha." If others talked to him about family matters, he would sigh deeply, expressing infinite sadness. Whenever it was the New Year or other festivals, when neighbors and fellow professionals shared the joy of family reunions, he was even more saddened, often saying to others, "I will never be able to get the true love of my parents in this life; I can only chant Buddha and cultivate for the next life!" Unexpectedly, when he was nearly thirty years old, an old man surnamed Wang sent him a letter, saying that he was his father, from whom he had been separated for twenty years. When Yunfang first received this letter, he suspected that it was an unscrupulous person impersonating him for fraud. However, after several correspondences and exchanging photos, it was finally proven to be his father, Bi Chang. At that time, Yunfang was overjoyed, thinking that it was his sincerity that moved him, and that the gods and Buddhas had secretly driven him, so he encouraged his father and son to leave their respective residences in Shandong Province and reunite in their ancestral home in Jiangsu Province (originally from Jintan, Jiangsu). In his surprise and joy, he specially hosted a banquet at the Daya Building on Fourth Avenue, inviting Mr. Bu Linwu, Xu Langxi, Su Shaoqing, Zen Master Huihai, and myself, among others. These people had either introduced him to perform in the south, or had a teacher-student relationship with him, and encouraged and taught him to promote his studies so that he could gain a foothold in Shanghai. At that time, his father, Bi Chang, also attended the banquet, but this person seemed to have a slight mental illness and did not say a word throughout the banquet. We were not convenient to inquire about the truth of this matter on the spot, but what can give us a superficial proof is that Mr. Bi Chang's face and figure are almost identical to Yunfang's, especially the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose. After he finished eating and left first, the crowd began to inquire Yunfang in detail about the course of this matter, and he had the following account. (132)</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Serenade</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"They Shall Have Music"</p>
<p>"Serenade" mainly introduces the violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz's performances, and The Peter Meremblum California Junior Symphony Orchestra. In the whole film, Jascha Heifetz's violin performance appears three times, and his fingering and bowing are solemnly introduced. During the first performance, the camera captures the use of his fingers and bowing from various angles. Therefore, for those who are interested in music and researchers, this specially filmed "Serenade" is worth seeing.</p>
<p>As for the story woven together, it tells of music professor Lawson taking in poor children as students, which leads to the school's financial difficulties and heavy debts. However, when he sees the students he personally trained succeed in art during the performance, his heartfelt joy is evident on his face. The success of an artist is achieved through much hardship and painstaking effort, which is very touching. However, in this "Serenade," which focuses on music, the director's skills are too weak, and it is far inferior when compared with "Danfeng Chaoyang," which has the same theme.</p>
<p>Joe McCreery and Andrea Leeds do not have much to do in the film. Walter Connolly, who plays Professor Lawson, performs very well in the style of a musician. For example, when he discovers that Frank understands musical notes, when his own band is playing a piece of music, and when he listens to a female student's piano solo at a concert, the expression of spiritual comfort is sincere and touching. The child who plays Frank is also very good at acting, but there are not enough opportunities for development here.</p>
<p>Xinhua Production "Love and Hate Unto Death," starring Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin (will be shown silently at the New Guangda Theater)</p>
<p>Brief News: The colored drawing cards of Peking Opera masks recently sold by Xiaoxing Bookstore on Henan Road are exquisite and accurate, and are the meticulous work of Zhang Junshi and Wu Yihan. Those who love national opera can use it as a reference. Now, a set of twelve kinds is sold for 80 cents in national currency.</p>
