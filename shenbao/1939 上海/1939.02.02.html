<h3>社評　救濟傷兵運動</h3>
<p>中日戰事發生以來，上海因地位上的特殊關係，在戰事初期中，各醫院即容納不少傷兵，當時社會上一般人士，很注意傷兵的救護慰問及其仙救濟事宜。可是戰事離開了上海以後，上海便僅成爲難民避難的區域，於是難民救濟，便成了上海社會上一個大問題；現在即使僅剩着少數難民，也很勞中外慈善巨紳，大聲疾呼，募捐救濟。但是關於傷兵救濟的聲息，卻久已不聞見了。其實傷兵救濟問題的嚴重，比上海少數難民的救濟，其重要實有過之無不及。因爲戰區擴大，戰事延長，傷兵便祗有一天天的增多。這些爲國負傷的健兒所需的醫藥給養費用何等浩大！這在政府方面，固然也具備着相當的費用，但欲求其救濟周到，爲無數萬在血肉挣扎中的傷兵，迅速解除痛苦，却非全國富有的人民，努力擴大救濟運動不可。上海在目前自然還是中國首屈一指的財富集中區域·所以由上海社會來發動這個運動·效果一定相當的鉅大。</p>
<p>我們要知道救濟難民的動機。尙不盡出於人道的立塲；何况在戰事進行之中，救濟負有戰鬥能力的傷兵，其影響於抗戰的前途，更是何等的遠大！受傷的士兵，其在軍事上的技術和胆識，普通都遠勝於新兵，倘能迅速救護傷愈歸隊，其效方亦自遠勝於招募新軍補充，這是直接加強中國抗戰的能力。現在戰地因爲救濟傷兵的設備不完全，常遭遇許多不必要的犧牲，倘能改進救護設備，便可以避免傷兵輾轉溝洫，流亡道路，無數傷心慘目的悲劇，這也是問接保全抗戰的實力。</p>
<p>不過傷兵救濟運動的必要，誰都知道；現在却是缺乏一種有組認的工作進行。我人常在上海報上看見外國新聞記者戰地通信，極言戰地中國傷兵的痛苦應事救濟，並且說有許多傷兵本可不死，但因爲醫救太遲，遂致喪生，甚至說這種熱心愛國受傷的健兒，有錢的人不捐欵救護他們，便是犯了罪惡。上海的富商巨賈不是很多嗎？而自戰事發生以來，爲避難人口增加的關係，因國難而發財的人也不在少數。年來戰時盈利很多的工商行家，允其租界區域的紡織業等，其中固自不乏愛國之士，應即如何大量捐助國家救濟傷兵經費，以爲首倡；而各公法團體，允應秉其平日救濟難民的熱忱，以贊助這個新運動的進行。何以至今還不見有人發起這個重要運動呢？</p>
<p>並且有錢者應即出錢而外，有力者自亦當出力。救濟傷兵的有力人士，自莫過於醫藥及護士人才。現在國聯的醫藥救護人員，以及印度菲列濱等處的外人尙且自動參加中國戰地服務。我們又看到近來捷克衛生部長夫人爲謀製造捐助中國傷兵的預防霍亂疫苗幾以身殉的事情，寧不慚愧欲死！難道中國人愛自已的國家，反不如外國人愛中國嗎？不！不！我們以爲只要有人發起這個救濟傷兵運動，上海有名的醫學團體如中華醫學會等，其中很多熱心人士，一定不會讓外國醫界人士專美於前，也將有人投向戰地服務，以爲國家盡點力量。至於所需的大量醫療用品，上海的新藥業公會，亦將徵集同業捐助。甚至海外的華僑，也可就所在地域的便利，徵集適宜的醫藥用品。譬如金雞納霜在中國戰地需要很殷，而過去只能用高價在港滬等處收買，但華僑所在很多的荷印，卻出產最多，倘能躉批捐助，豈不便利適宜！</p>
<p>不過在整個的救濟傷兵運動中，「出錢」還是比「出力」要緊，因爲有了金錢，便可支配人力。醫事的設備，固可因此購置完備，便是傷兵的給養營衛，也得因此措置合宜。且看上海社會的熱心愛國人士，用什麼大規模來推進目前這個最關重要的「救濟傷兵運動」？</p>
<h3>吳佩孚拒就僞職</h3>
<p>不受任何威脅利誘</p>
<p>平津民衆聞之大慰</p>
<p>香港　津訊、日本誘惑吳佩孚出任僞職、進行甚猛、日前嗾使平津浪人通電擁吳、且散布謠言、謂吳已接受某偽職、並代的中外記者一百三十餘人、於三十日與吳會見、事前由日本特務機關備妥談話稿、當塲發表、不料吳於接見時、所談內容與日方預定原稿完全相反、吳不但未表示接受之意、且提出三項條件、謂非如此不能得眞正和平、外國記者咸爲驚愕、卽日監視人員亦爲之失色、乃急令檢查機關扣留外國記者電報、同時並將日所預擬之談話由同盟社抄發、希圖掩飾、吳態度甚堅决、任何威脅利誘皆所不顧、平津民衆聞之大慰、（一日電）</p>
<p>北平　日方亟圖授以偽職之吳佩孚、今日在中日衛兵嚴密保護下之私寓中、接見外國記者、但未說明其職位、僅陳述和平之有益、並謂渠曾得中日友人之請、出而領導和平運動、但欲和平成功、渠必須具有實力、及推行和平之能力、自日人各界對吳氏言辭稍起不滿之反響利斷之、吳氏尙未被日方所誘致、據可靠方面稱、吳氏之要求含有、　組織强大之中國軍隊、完全由吳氏指揮、　中國實權交還華人之手、據吳氏所發言辭之譯文觀之、確載有第二項建議、（三十一日路透社電）</p>

<p>東京　日本各報對於希特勒在國會中所作之演說、咸皆表示滿意、尤其飛希特勒在演詞中所及之反共恊定及中日戰爭之兩點、更感滿意、據此間「日日新聞」評述希特勒之演說、據謂、德國對於英法之不滿、由於英法兩國對德之不能公平待遇、抑且彼等希望德國常陷於困苦之境、不能成爲强國所致、該報對於希特勒所作關於東亞方面之演說、認爲極有理由、並盛贊希特勒之能力主訂立反共協定、使日德意成一聯合陣綫、共作反共之舉、該報又謂、希特勒之要求歸還舊殖民地、英法兩國在道義上、應從速將其昔日所攫者交還德國、惟該報對於日本在太平洋上之代管各島、以前原爲德國所有者、則並不提及、「日日新聞」又謂、倘使英决希望得到自身之和平及安全、應承認德國有其生存之餘地、該報繼又論及德法兩國在十一月中所作之和平宣言、謂此乃希特勒綏靖政策之表現、但希特勒决不能因此宣言而將目前所遭之不公平待遇、即行熟視無覩、且在邏輯上亦屬不合也、最後該報又稱、德國已準備擁護意大利對法所作之殖民地要求、蓋因去年德國在奧捷方面有所行動時、會獲意大利之支持、故希特勒此際乃有以報之也、（一日美聯電）</p>

<p>報吿又提議於黨章中將本黨業已實行、使黨內民主能切實實現之各項辦法、列爲具體條文、如黨部選舉之秘密投票、禁止按名單選舉、黨員可以無限制批評攻擊候選人、按期召集市及區黨部積極工作人員會議、因黨之首要組織任務、爲幹部之正確選擇、及决議案實施狀况之考察、報吿建議於聯共中委會下設立幹部廳、於省及區域黨委員會、各民族共和國黨中央委員會·以及市及區委員會下設幹部部、</p>
<p>爲提高黨之宣傳及鼓動工作達正當水平起見、報吿建議於聯共中委會下設宣傳鼓動廳、省及區域黨委員會各民族其和國黨中央委員會以及市及區委員會下設宣傳鼓動部、</p>
<p>因黨與國家生活步調加速、並爲反對解决黨的政策方面緊急問題起見、報吿提議每年至少召集全聯地方黨部代表全體會議一决、並賦與該會議以召回中央委員會中不能切實執行責任之委員、而改推其他委員代替之權利、惟人數不能超過黨代表大會選出中委人數五分之一以上、上述會議之决定、除改推中委一項外、均應經過中央委員會核准、</p>

<p>爲造成提拔新工作幹部仟黨內領導工作之條件起見、報告建議規定省及區域委員會及民族共和國中央委員會書記之最低在黨履歷爲五年以上（前此爲十二年）各下級黨部書記之最低在黨履歷亦應相並减短（一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>法衆議院　通過法案</h3>
<p>義務兵役期延長</p>
<p>陸空軍現役員額　認爲有提高必要</p>
<p>巴黎　政府前因歐戰期內出生率减少之故、會於一九三六年頒佈法律、規定至一九四〇年爲止、義務兵役期限應自一年半提高至兩年、以爲彌補缺額之計、衆議院複於本日午後通過法律案、規定兩年兵役制在一九四〇年之後、依然適用、因而成爲經常的辦法、此外並通過法案、規定陸軍後備隊士兵訓練期限、雖不予以延長、但其决數應予以增加、討論之際、兵役法案報吿員伊斯納、會發表演說云、德國陸軍現役軍員額共有九〇〇·〇〇〇名、法國本部軍隊現役員額僅有四五〇·〇〇〇員名、加之德義兩國成立軸心以還、法國東北東南兩部邊界、均須同時防衛、而軍備充實邊境添造防禦工事之後、陸軍員額亦有予以提高之必要、因此種種、現役軍員額務當增加至五五〇·〇〇〇員名、始克有濟、至高射砲隊與空軍官兵現有員額之有待於提高、猶其餘事、航空部長賴尙伯爾則就法國向美國訂购飛機事發表演說云、「吾國所訂購者、乃係美國最佳的飛機、此應歸功于羅斯幅總統」、法國各飛機廠每月製造額現爲九十架、即可增至一百架云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴塞羅納　此間昨夜宣稱、西國民軍昨向加泰隆北部推進、計進佔一百二十公里、在各重耍據點遭遇政府軍之堅决抵抗、衆料政府軍在山嶺諸地、利用天險、整理陣地、準備與國民軍作殊死戰、在維契方面之政府軍亦抵抗甚力、因該處陣綫、倘爲國民軍突破、將使該處之政府軍遭受包圍之虞、而使出嶺天險、全歸無效云、（一日海通電）</p>

<h3>德國志願和平　英國實具有同感</h3>
<p>張伯倫演說響應希特勒</p>
<p>國際談判認爲時機未熟</p>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相本日在下議院發表演說、說明現行外交政策、有云、「希特勒兀首甚望英德兩國民族能以互相信任、通力合作、此種表示實爲余所歡迎、余願乘此機會軍行聲明、英國政府與人民完全具有同感」、英德兩國政府在目下雖未考慮進行何項談判、但雙方實業界代表刻正進行談話、至可欣幸、至以希特勒元有昨日所發表之全部演詞而論、「余个人深知發此言者、决非準備爲歐洲再度引起危機之人、甚且一再發出表示、謂和平局勢乃係德國所必要、所見與吾人相同」、·余意國際間一切問題、均可經由談判方式予以解决、「但若國際空氣不佳、則卽進行談判、以期解决爭議滿足願望。消除怨恨、亦屬無益之舉、質言之、進行談判時、苟非參加其事者咸皆相信全體與會之人、均皆和平是尙、切望成立和半解决方案、並非居心叵測、　亦無濟於事、歐洲各國經過長時期之不安、長時期之焦念而後、茲已遂漸恢復信心、余當敬告全世界日、吾人所願見者、不僅和平志願、且欲在成立最後解决方案之前、發現一種較爲具體的證據、質言之、即各國縱不能解除軍備、至少當有限制軍備之意旨是也、此種時機若果屆臨、則英國全國人民匪特寄以同情心、其對於綏靖歐洲一般局勢一層、且當盡其所能、此則有可斷言者也」云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　昨日下院辯論外交事務時、首相張伯倫宣稱、吾人今開始得覩吾人對整武一舉作長時間準備後之效果矣、民衆之各方面現皆覺吾人之努力、已使吾之防衛力增加良巨、吾八在國外之威望、從未高於今日、吾人之友誼、從未有如今日之爲各國所切欲得之、頃間阿特里所稱綏靖政策已吿失敗之說、實屬不確、實則余仍使之逐步前進、</p>
<p>重申英法間關係</p>
<p>余望吾人此次之報聘羅馬、已增強英義兩國間之友誼、而同時並未减弱吾人與法國之關係、英法間之關係、其密切與親熱、在吾人記憶中殆未有如今日者、不寗唯是、此項關係今且以相互信任爲根據、而遠非昔日可比矣、</p>
<p>下院於耶誕節休會後今復集會、一般人士皆料其將辯論外交亟欲一聆、故院中爲之人滿、公私旁聽欄皆無虛席、外交團席亦滿座、辯論於問話時間過後即由反對黨領袖阿特里開始之、</p>
<p>對希氏演辭滿意</p>
<p>首相演說中謂英政府覩法德最近之宜言、大爲滿意、而希特勒演說前、一般報紙所見過份之恐慌、與所作之豫測、今亦爲事實銷釋矣、希氏之演說、爲文甚長、涉及許多事件、包括廣大範圍、余非僭謂余已有時間逐句加以審愼之研究、但余能作此言，余已確切具有此非準備將歐洲投入另一危機中者所發演說之印象、余意演詞中有多節表示德國之亟需和乎、正與他國相同、吾人均有自己之內部問題、自己之經濟或金融問題、或一國中之失業問題、或在他國這其他問題、各國政治家今日之應聚精會神、從事於其自己人民的狀况之改善、此種見解、吾人無一能不予以同情也、按首相涉及希特勒演詞之前、且曾在問話時間內答語中言及之、</p>
<p>首相答語中謂渠對於希氏演詞中所稱切願英德人民間有相互之信任與合作一節、表示歡迎、余願乘此機會重行聲明此種情緖英國朝野固同具之、英政府今未計議與德國進行談判、但殊樂於聲明者、兩國工業代表最近曾對許多工業事件作一番討論、</p>
<p>恪守不干涉政策</p>
<p>首相續言、不干涉西戰之政策、進行殊堪滿意、更變此項政策、今尙非其時、渠並不認目前西班牙之局勢、足以危害歐洲之和平、但渠願切實聲明者、此際若以任何大規模加以干涉、則勢必導成歐洲戰禍之擴大、而成和平之禍害、此政府所以不願更變其不干涉政策也、</p>
<p>駁斥反對黨言論</p>
<p>首相至是述及反對黨領飛阿特里所稱弗朗哥將軍之勝利、恐將使英國在軍略上受有威脅一節、謂外相與本人近在羅馬時猶接墨索里尼與齊亞諾伯爵重新給予之保證、卽西班牙內戰一旦結束、義國不欲向西班牙有所要索是、希特勒亦作同樣之保證、至於西班牙之難民、政府巳盡力予以援助、今後仍將如是、渠望弗朗哥將軍能許闢中立安全區、以安置婦孺與受傷者、聞法政府刻正與西政府竭力商辦此舉、首相責反對黨不應對全能的國家諸領袖之意志、取可能的最惡劣之見解、不應對不確之空談、作種種之幻想、以自驚擾、且不應對英國之實力、作種種吹毛求疵之論、渠信各國間之問題雖屬嚴重、而無不能藉討論以解决之者、但渠必附帶聲明者、苟非空氣已轉良好、苟非從事討論者皆覺列席者皆欲獲和平之解决、其胸襟中並不懷有惡意、則進行討論以求異見之消釋、願望之得償、怨惡之袪除、不可得也、</p>
<p>首相述及反對黨不信墨索里尼與希特勒所發之言論、而加駁責曰、凡對發言者將守其所言給予保證、其惡劣之道、無過於吿人曰、爾勿信之、爾之行動、可以爾之推想其人將不守的爲根據、余敢决阿特里已錯誤矣、吾人從事作最後解决之前、願見各方有作同盟志願之明證、縱非爲解除軍備之同盟、亦當爲限制軍備之同盟、此種時機一旦降臨、如吾人能在各處見到與吾人自已所抱者相符之精神、則余知英國必準備對一般綏靖有所貢獻也、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>報吿訪羅馬經過</p>
<p>倫敦　昨日首相張伯倫在下院報吿其訪問羅馬之經過、謂墨索里尼在英義談話之中、曾保證對於西班牙並無任何要求義外相齊亞諾亦曾重申墨氏之保證謂義國對於西班牙任何領土、並無土地野心、吾人對於正式會議或談判中之討論、自不能認爲含有試探或非正式之性質、故渠所得之一般印象、以爲墨氏首先明白表示義大利之政策即係和平、及必要時彼將樂於使用其勢力以擁護和平、墨氏更說明柏林羅馬軸心、爲義犬利外交政策之要點、吾人亦同樣說明英法之合作、爲英國政策之基礎云、首相續稱、墨氏對於英義協定之條款、表示滿意、並一再鄭重申明義大利將信守協定所規定義務之志願、吾人明知法義間之最大障碍、即爲西班牙問題、故在西戰未了之前、法義兩國之談判、似未必有何結果、關於軍縮方面墨氏贊成第一步實行質的限制、墨氏認猶太問題爲國際性質、必須處之以寬大云、張氏稱英義談話時、空氣極爲融洽、雙方所提出之爭點及意見、自難望盡爲對方接受、故雖不能報吿談話中雙方對於各點皆已同意、但談話之目的則確巳達到矣、張氏最後又述及謁晤敎皇之情形、謂渠與哈立法克斯對於敎皇舉止熊度中所表現之勇毅及人道主義精神、皆受深切之感動云、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>工黨自由黨　責難政府</h3>
<p>一味遷就隱忍　反足鼓勵侵略</p>
<p>倫敦　昨日下院辯論外交時、由反對黨領袖阿特里以西班牙問題開始之、阿氏謂首相言及墨索里尼志在和平時、大不列顚之人民因墨氏嘗干涉西班牙戰事、至少已兩年半之久、故更爲感慨、首相當覺英國一般輿情對於英政府在西戰全部中所取態度、日益不滿、義國自己所發之宣言、事實昭彰、而乃欲對義國輔助國民軍在加泰隆所取攻勢之舉力加掩飾、凡此企圖皆屬愚妄、進攻巴薩羅納之軍隊、過半數爲義人、義人已歡賀巴薩羅納之陷落爲義國之大勝利、英政府在西班牙問題全部中之行動、除尼翁條的尙差强人意外、其餘一切、皆確切鼓勵侵略者也、</p>
<p>自由反對黨領袖辛克萊繼起發言、謂今雖無抱失敗觀之理由、然政府無政策、確不能令人信任、吾人雖一方面重整軍備、但在海外巳失去重要及强大勢力之援助、吾人在數月之前尙可依頭此力以抵抗侵略，現時羅馬柏林軸心、巳成爲橫於歐洲地圖上之地理上及軍事上的實體、而將歐洲劃成東西兩大部分、英國現應表示其所採取自由與國際親善之立塲、旣無所謂羞辱、該無所恐懼、吾人願援助德義入民及其他民族、建立一種公允正直之世界秩序、首相張伯倫今叉在和平方面增加一筆債務、首相已使德義大部份人民相信其個人及英國一切挑護之者所具之親善及和平意旨、德義兩國已有許多人民在首相及其所持之傘下、發見禮貌容忍及沉靜之象徵、以之與全能各國主宰者自豪之態度相比較、自覺其佳妙也、</p>
<p>工黨領袖格林武至此乃繼起發言、以結束此項辯論、據稱吾人當知曾有英船一百三十艘、遭遇弗朗哥軍隊之攻擊、英國所提出之抗議、亦悉遭置諸不理、干涉西戰業經加强矣、英政府所處之地位、實至爲反常、蓋認以軍火供給西政府或足促成各國間之戰爭、而德義明白援助弗朗哥反可獲得和平也、至於謂弗朗哥所有大量軍火、皆係俘獲而得、殊屬荒謬、實則皆山吾首相最親善合作之二國所接濟者也、格氏末稱、戰爭之危險祇在二人、即希特勒與墨索尼里尼是也、（一日路透社電）</p>

<p>柏林　德國各報對於英首相張伯倫所發表之演說一致予以好評、咸謂此項演說之發表、後於希特勒兀首向國會致辭者二十四小時、故可視爲英國當局之正面反應、德意志總彙報載稱、「張伯倫首相演說之中、涉及希特勒元首所說各卽、德國方面自當引爲滿意、此外、希特勒元首所謂、「他國若果向義國作戰、不論動機如何、德國决爲義國之助」一節、英國反對派領袖竟加以曲解、而張伯倫首相業已切實爲之糾正、尤屬難能可貴」、漢堡城外論報載稱、「希特勒兀首發表演說之後、全世界人士所懷意念、茲已由張伯倫首相發揮無遺、外國政治家最速之正式反應旣若是、藉知希特勒兀首所揭橥之持久的公允的和平政策、業已獲有勝利、此外，張伯倫首相演說中、尙有一點未可漠視者、卽一般職業的悲觀派對於歐洲各全能國、夙爲仇視的成見所蒙蔽、故於希特勒兀旨日昨所發表之演說、又以爲行將引起危機、今得張伯倫首相之一言、反證其爲虛妄矣」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　柏林各報刊載關於訊、均冠以下列及類似之標題曰、「倫敦更變態度」、「噩夢醒矣」、「舉世得異常深刻之印象」、德國普報載稱、德國貢獻於歐洲之改組者、巳於適當時間作確當之語、吾人須殷切等待、而觀其他政治家是吾接收德國外交政策之方針與如何接受之、德國地方日報警吿世上不可誤解希氏之演說、據稱巨大之問題、絕未失其嚴重急切與力量、惟此項問題巳用一種方法提出、而使反對者自始即處於惡劣之地位、彼自以為分配世界者、其一國事業之强國即英國者巳確切感覺之矣、（一日路透電）</p>

<h3>我之人生觀與吾人從事　職業敎育之基本理論（二）  黃炎培</h3>
<p>世界之有國家，基於生活上環境上種種要求與其演變·然其先天條件，凡以爲民而已矣。故政治制度，有正軌焉。在民治民有民享三要義下，爲適當之設定。對名實不合者，祗有去僞以求眞。其或廢棄一切，采用獨栽，此乃迫於某種特殊環境，求一時應付之便利而然，而政治史上只有認爲某方面某時期的變態組織，而置之例外，且預料作用終了，自將步上正軌，而决不能以此爲永久經邦大法也。至於社會經濟制度，亦惟有在社會與國家整個利益下，維護個人正當利益。其有憑籍特殊地位，謀獨占或多占，形成不公不平，皆所不取也。政治經種種演變，而提出民主制度，經濟經種種演變，而提出社會主義，皆爲吾人信念所在。就國家立塲言，無論政治或經濟，其原則總在尊重維護民衆的權與利而集中並增厚一切力量，獻之國家，以完成其對內造成强固有力個體之使命。</p>
<p>如何盡量維護民衆的權與利？最有效方法，莫如用啟發方式，使人人明瞭其自身在應盡義務以外，應享權與利之質量與限度，而努力取求，而珍重行使；如何集中並增厚一切力量以獻之國家？最有效方法，莫如濬發人人智力，運用科學，以開拓地方與物力，其扼要在從人人日常工作，即以其勞心或勞力換取生活所需求之定型動作上，用啟發方式，使人人增益其智能，即知而即行之。並深明其意義，使知人生長日勞心勞力，不專爲個人生活計，而在恰盡其直接對羣，間接對國的神聖義務，於是地力物力，因從事開拓者知能之正確與純熟而增厚，因人人對於靖獻國家大義之普遍的明瞭而集中，而國家整個力量，因以强固。其間更將有二大貢獻；人人對於其日常勞作，旣確認爲對羣神聖義務，因善意之相感，亦使人人對勞作者還而敬厚有加，相爭相殺之風，漸化爲相親相愛，當不失爲减少人類慘變之一種作用，一也。因其智能增益，重在即知卽行，使思想與動作聯系，悉其聰明才力，運用於日常工作，因求效率之增加，日從事於工作之改進，促成事物之新發明，從此有裨於文化之發展，藉以補吾國二千年來發明闕乏，文化落後之遺憾，二也。</p>
<p>基於如上之認識，乃各求所以致力之道。其道多端，而就吾人思之，所謂用啟發方式，使人人明瞭其自身應盡之義務，與應享權與利之質量與限度，而努力取求，而珍重行使，敎育是也。所謂人人以其勞心或勞力換取生活需求之定型動作，職業是也。而用啟發方式，使人人增益其智能，即知而即行之，並深明其意義，則職業敎育是也。</p>
<p>敎育，職業敎育，經緯萬端。而其對於國家主耍貢獻，不外乎此。一國家之建立，經緯萬端，而其所以培養實力之基本條件，不外乎此。</p>
<p>吾人有所見及，立試爲之。雖局一隅，必傾全力。小試而成，因以大行，則自我自人，初無所擇。藍知而即行，成而不居，以之勉人，亦所以自勉也。至求工作效能之增進，則集合同志，組織必須健全，紀律必須嚴明，生活必須整飭，勞苦皆所弗辭，蓋壹爲信念所驅使而然也。</p>
<p>同人根據上述人生原則，以及整個世界觀念，人生觀念，憑其澈上澈下的認識，輒敢慷慨負荷重大而艱鉅如上之使命，以爲對國家切要貢獻，亦即對世界全人類初步之切要貢獻，從事以來，亦有年矣。敬布腹心，以乞知我者之明敎。職業敎育目的民國六年</p>

<h3>證券　內債已見回漲</h3>

<p>證券暗盤昨日市况、各債均係除息行市計算、在一度盤旋之後、漸起回風、市塲情形、初則充滿懷疑及觀望做多者、其胃量均已達飽和點、賣方多數賣出連息、避免分月餘息之麻煩、而乘小收回、一轉移間、不營巳收到全息、跌風至此、乃吿一段落、回風陡起、午前午後絕對懸殊、惟回風之有無繼續性、一般人尙多壞疑也、行市稍回、謠言全息、午前盤旋呆滯狀况、依然不改、買賣雙方均極閒散、觀望擯持、毫無生意、午後四十一號忽來乘低買進、同康號出戊入丙、亦甚熱鬧、散戶因亦進多出少、此種回風、並非補空、乃一時做多、故午後回漲一元數角、似嫌過驟、甲乙兩極除息新開出故列表見跌、非事實也、市價結果、甲丁種除息新做不計外、其他均回好一元一二角、成交數的五十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>表內甲丁兩種除息價、新開出、故比連息價爲跌、</p>
<p>股票行市、各行號盈虧不一、股票市價乃亦漲跌各異、中國國貨公司生意異常發達、股票票面二十元、刻下出價二十八元買不進、聞有兩股升一股之傳說、中華書局股成交數千股、價爲二十四元、比前日好數角、</p>
<h3>金融　現金人心又向榮　回出二零二零元關外</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、當日起伏益形狹窄、惟價則反動轉堅、蓋聞外滙受洋行扒結後、頓見軟化、且歐洲局勢自希特勒發表演說後、日見緩和、人心稍稍向榮、致重父引起港帮購金心思、復吿濃厚、故曾一度託某金號及某銀樓代爲搜購、卒賴銀樓帮曁現金號及證券帮等源源供給、故漲勢極微、結巢僅回漲三元、各方人心較上日稍好、交易平平、銀樓飾金則依然呆定、海關金曁中英純金等繼續下降、</p>
<p>烚赤港幫進意復濃</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開卽聞外滙受洋行扒後稍見軟化、且某金號代港帮進意頗濃、故晨開卽抬高至二千　廿元，乃由某金號進證券帮及現金號各五十兩、後又進銀樓帮百兩、價則相同、未幾某銀樓亦代港帮吸購、進現金號五十兩、價亦相同、繼之冉進同業五十兩、價廿一元、金號進銀樓帮卅兩、價廿二元、某金號又進銀樓帮五十兩、價則相仿、銀樓帮吐售後俄即原價復進、現金號五十兩、後相同價又見錢兌業售予銀樓帮五十兩、另一錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價仍廿二元、時巳十一時、至此後供求均稀、價亦呆定、直至午時仍未做開、故午收仍爲廿二元、午後因外滙無市、交易更形寥落、在三時光景、僅見錢兌業互做五十兩、價仍廿二元、此後益加沉寂、故晚收仍與午收無異、結果較上日軋漲三元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇卅元、牧進二千〇十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤呆定逾恒、故而依然未更、大同行老慶雲等仍懸原價二百〇五元、新同行懸二百〇三元、收進一百九十七元、</p>
<p>英鎊高昂純金績跌</p>
<p>卅一日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊自希特勒發表演說後、日見高昂、故而人心向下、後每盎斯續跌一辦士半、計退達七鎊八先令六辦士、中央銀行之中國現余收買價亦降低至一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金亦低三厘、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌一元、計一千二百〇七元六角、</p>
<h3>兩週來　錢業劃頭交換數</h3>
<p>—一千二百萬元左右—</p>
<p>上海錢業自於本年一月十六日起將劃頭亦加入準備庫交換後、初以爲試辦性質、並不披露、即本報將此項消息刋布後、外界猶以爲係銀行劃頭交換之誤、竟有牽涉爲外灘銀行、足見誤會之多、茲將錢業自辦劃頭交換以來之兩週中數額披露於後、但本報並未派遺任何人至錢業公會調查此項數字、要和本報新聞之樣訪、自有其方式、此可爲各方面吿、（〇）（單位元）</p>
<h3>洋行結款日增　外匯復轉緊勢</h3>
<p>滙市昨以外電雖續來供塞、但因廢曆年關逼近、洋行結款日增、且歐局外弛內緊、銀行供給不暢、致潛勢復緊、唯中途仍無特變、成交尙旺、港滙緣錢兌業拋塞不殷、吸銀行吸胃較佳、故狀况亦稍軋緊、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠續縮、紐的現貨仍平、倫勃生金縮一辦士半、滙兌英對美長一厘三、對法與對滬均仍不動、美對英降四三七五、對法跌一二五、對滬小二分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開賣價英滙計爲八辦士三二八一二五、美滙十六元二五、較前收英縮〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、開後洋行首先猛扒美行荷蘭華比零英金僅八辦士三二八一二五、致形勢趨緊、英金會做緊至八辦士三一二五、美滙最軟做至十六元一八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉降二五、此後外電傾來吐出售予荷蘭滙豐英金爲八辦士三四三七五、又售予華比美行美匯十六元二八一二五、故過程稍形回硬、入後洋行復來購進美銀行美滙祇十穴元二一八七五、加之華義荷蘭安達等吃進錢兌業港滙從五十六元一二五、縮爲五十六元、致狀况終復步緊、午收銀行賣價英滙八辦士三二八一二五、美滙十六元二一八七五、結果比前收英緊〇一五六二五、美縮〇六二五、港軟一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>外幣需要驟旺</p>
<p>昨日英純金跌一辦士半、英美滙兌降四三七五、外滙交易尙旺、銀行供給未暢、趨勢徵弱、週三下午無市、烚赤供求平衡、大戶吐納轉稀、下午市塲更形蕭條、勢呈盤旋、外幣殷富又有收藏、外滙收盤稍弱、市價益形堅挺、多數復趨上升、美金票需要培增、法郎票亦旺、趨勢堅秀、公會交易尙盛、永泰出恒茂進美金票一千元、又出惠通進美金鎊十個、勒泰出三泰進美金票二千元、復盛出福和祥進法郎票四千個、昨日市價、英金鎊升二角、美金鎊升三角、美金票升一分四厘、香港票升五厘、法郎票升半厘、新加坡票荷蘭票各升二分、坎拿大票升四分、斐律濱票升三分、義大利票降一分半、澳金票升叫角、僅英金票安南票羅比票德金票暹邏票未更、</p>
<p>貼現平隱</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率巳趨呆站、每千元仍盤於卅七元左右、終爲卅七元、比與上日價無榮辱云、</p>
<p>英印銀價均疲</p>
<p>三十一日惀敦電、投機家少數買進及賣出、市面鮮少變幻、收盤後依然平定、大條銀近遠期續縮〇六二五、紐約銀電、美銀價依舊呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀市况稍疲、現貨與近期均回縮三安那、遠期則回縮四安那云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　中外絲價　一致騰貴</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、日美均突飛猛漲、横濱現貨晨開九一五元、下午收盤九二〇元、計較前日飛漲三〇元之巨、遠期晨開八九〇元、下午收盤八九七元、計漲二四元、紐的八三分日絲售開一·九九元、漲五分、七五分日絲開一·九三元、漲三分、上海絲一·八九元、漲五分、廣東絲漲一分、交易所近期漲四分、遠期漲四分半、由於國外絲市之瘋在上騰、本埠情形更緊佾逾恒、洋行用戶市價之距離巳達一〇〇元、用戶白廠本返、巳售開一三九〇元、和平等級售開一四四○元、無錫小車、亦巳）售開一三五〇元、市塲人心熱烈異常、故絲價雖日益高昂，但絲交巳不若週前旺盛矣、洋行絲市、僅印非略有走銷、下午輯里做開七六〇元、計漲起三四十元、按一月份來、上海廠絲市價已漲起一四〇元、（一月初白廠B字價一二六〇元、一月底已漲至一四〇〇元之上、）洋行絲交靜寂已久、用戶國戶獨見旺盛、實非廠絲之良好出路也，</p>
<p>一日有絲經五百十六件運歐洲、</p>
<h3>紗花　滇粵幫又動　棉紗跌勢稍定</h3>
<p>雙馬棧單業中仍在拖進</p>
<p>日紗大鬆二月份未做開</p>
<p>紗市連疲多日、昨則局勢稍轉和平、同時雲南潮汕帮納胃較健、買去粗細紗的近三百包、其他仍無起色之望、惟有一部份議論謂在近幾日中比高峯價已跌十六元之譜、且申新廠方雖有巨量額子開出、然都係期貨、暫時不能打棧單、泰半在金融界手中、目前决無放出之理、所以對於虧蝕之貨、皆不願斬脫、而擯持不動、虛弱市况因之稍定、售盤參差不一矣、</p>
<p>查現紗市塲情形、晨初開盤、氣勢萎靡無勁、因實銷冷淡、叉在年關催近之際、一般無心挺過年之浮多、叉來出檔、市象允挫、開價跌五角、二十支雙馬紗價爲三日九十一元半、香港帮僅進十包、此後客銷不旺、逐步磨小、雙馬幾破九十元關門、旋以某某拖進棧單雙馬紗二百包外、收盤又復回昂一步、雙馬現紗價仍做三百九十二元、與上日無軒輊、查上午成交統計九百二十四包、仍以同業交易占三分之二、結果行情二十支雙馬與上日相仿、天女跌五角、特金城漲一元、雙地球漲一角半、惟十八支天女跌一元半、廠方未有舉動、昨有棉紗一百三十五件運厦門、五百九十件運汕頭、二十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分誌如下、</p>
<p>日紗市塲空頭軋過後、掩面大鬆、市價續趨下挫、同時實需淸淡異常、二十支水月現紗價爲三百二十四五元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十元、二月份始終未曾做開云、</p>
<h3>棉花交易有待紅盤</h3>
<p>海外市價俱漲</p>
<p>外棉市價、美棉價格、目前全賴政府棉業立法及貸款棉之出售問題爲依歸、然國會方面對於此項全世界所注目之棉業問題、亦時與時吾、使人殊難捉摸、此題係屬世界嚴重間題、此乃實情、故各經營者惶惑不安、均鵠候華盛頓方面之發展也、昨日紐的漲四磅音、印度因前日紐的遠期激漲、昨日連同預測漲起二羅比、埃及仍然停市、昨日滙兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲六角、印棉漲丸角、埃及棉漲一角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因廢曆年關轉瞬即屆、各屬交易已轉靜寂、况本週來紗價未見起色、故年內恐無大宗交易矣、惟終信明年紅槃紗價見好、外棉交易亦需待之明年矣、昨日日廠方面尙有小額交易、茲將昨日成交件額及價格分列於後</p>
<p>本棉生意保滯、各方皆無活動之意、幾入於停頓狀態中、實緣總結賬時期日近、花商預備結束過年、交易更無發展氣象、加之價格已漲至再無可漲之境、廠方因邇來紗市平淡乏勁、辦胃益狹、惟購外棉尙在方興未艾中、蘇北一路、來源益稀、通花到八百四十六包、游浦來五十四件、二百二十件由白茆來、北沙來一百九十件、出口則有一百七十件運汕頭、九十件運香港、五十件運北海、茲將現棉售盤並成交額列左、</p>
<h3>糧食　下脚粉北銷徵動　麥價堅守原盤</h3>
<p>粉昨市仍見穩定、客帮零星交易絡繹不絕、南洋帮添辦二號粉等的有五六千包、北洋帮去化較增、成交的近二萬包、禿中車船等牌二號粉的佔半數、其餘均爲四五號粉、計開車船牌四元八角、紅劉海三元五角半、白袋三元三角、市面形勢、年內恐無重大變化云、昨日裝出有三千包運威海衛、二千包運烟台、八十五百包運厦門、</p>
<p>麥昨來源依然不多、成本亦少興奮、廠方以洋麥到貨不繼、國麥辦耍尙貪、貨方動輒提高價盤、故又不願暢收、市面擯持、結果僅開江北高麥一種、價爲六元五角半之原盤、福新阜豐兩廠各辦一千包、</p>
<p>客仙大市貨　交易較旺</p>
<p>昨日客秈軍輪到數不多、有自辯沛來者二千一百五十包、而本街零戶納胃轉香、店舖工廠外國戶亦多趁早吸收、故晨間開出一千餘包、午後續有二千多包成交、允以十元〇二三角之大市貨爲活潑、高决各檔成交均少、南京秈又昂至十元〇八角、蕪秈高决均未售開、而中關貨則較市漲起角許云、</p>
<p>杜米轉振作　滬棧悉已儲滿　來源因之更稀</p>
<p>國米市日來一路下挫後、更以滬棧囤滿之故、內地來源頓稀、河下貨祗到三號、車輪包子亦僅一二千包、所以人心立振、有欣欣向榮之概、本街銷塲頗見活絡、不過囤戶仍以無棧可容、鮮有進取、致市面尙未十分挺秀、結果厚粳除中市跌透價回起角餘、高科祇好數分、薄稻以河下缺貨、提起一角、原包無甚進出、杜洋尖埠尖因之亦不過略好數分、變元高貨無榮辱、中關者亦見帶好角外矣、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆子出口五百餘噸</h3>
<p>厦門等處仍在績辦</p>
<p>黃豆升降、向依火車豆爲標準、但自戰端開始後、車豆顆粒無市、祇崇明沙黃、每日有行有市、致賣買雙方竟作標準看、邇來該豆因受環境關係、來源見少、市氣在銷塲熱俏之下、邁步騰漲、但昨市去路稍見懈淡、計開高品沙黃七元七角、大市貨自七元六角四分至四角半、由本街厦門帮辦去六百餘包、其他平湖中粒杜豆開五十包、價爲九元、及回籠大連豆五十包、價爲七元九角半云、裝運出口者咋有豆子二百五十包、運度門、五十包遝香港、四百二十一噸運孟買、一百零一噸運可倫布、叉豆餅五百片運厦門、四百片運汕頭、生油一千六百四十聽運香港、</p>
<p>糖市　國糖市氣獨堅</p>
<p>昨荷糖趨勢仍弱、公會劃盤、二叫荷粗白外棧現貨、雖呌二十四元原盤、但乏受手、轉口貨又小二角、爲十五元六角、太古車白B嘜西棧貨降至二十三元六角、東棧貨二十三元半、而行方售盤更覺遷就、蓋防後市再軟、國糖則市勢異趨、因本屆各產區出數均减、如漳州苟照去冬而論、每日至少須出數百担、但現在每日僅數十担、並以土白糖好銷、有一部份均改製白糖、故靑糖愈少、汕頭現在鄉戶運汕求售者不湧、如下鄉採辦、價難低落、翁有北帮在汕守辦、故靑赤白一致堅挺、泉州邇來以有外帮採辦、地價頻漲、高白糖劃申須二十六七元、靑赤亦俱倒懸、昨號盤僅開出興化决白七十餘包、價爲十八元、潮糖略有續開無上落、黃崗靑百餘包、十三元八角、卅一日有糖一千一百包運寗波、</p>
<p>雜項　三柰猛跌四元</p>
<p>三奈因預計三月中旬可以登塲、並爲大結束關係、故有一部份不欲久擱者、均願虧本軋卸、昨市曾放價二十四元、開出二十餘包、然照此價按算、雖非底盤、但到存買屬不厚、可無再鬆之虞、</p>
<p>南北冀　桃蓮俱見提漲</p>
<p>關裏手揀桃、近日開價見增、曾達四十四元、行方售四十六元、其决自四十元左右至二十六七元不一、明光湖蓮、近有運到、貨絞佳、故售價提至四十元、比前須升五六元、湘蓮堅定無上落、本湖蓮一百二十五元、决之一百二十元、頂白蓮呌售一百元、到存俱稀、</p>
<p>煤炭　焦炭滯銷猛</p>
<p>已小去五十元之鉅</p>
<p>近因本埠翻砂廠年近歲暮、大都停工、是以焦炭銷路、頓受打擊、存貨山積、市情萎靡、最近暗盤僅開一百七十元、比前跌去五十元之多、而去胃依然不振、似有續疲之勢、聞一般外行囤戶、現貨在手、受虧不少、自非始料所及、</p>
<h3>疋頭　大結束期轉瞬將屆　各路添辦漸形冷落</h3>
<p>廠貨遠期昂於近期</p>
<p>國布浙閩內地各客帮、現需淸淡、因巳近總結賬時期、均須軋算頭寸、原訂各貨、仍源源裝發、新添辦已若斷若續、市面平平、氣勢仍緊、廠方遠期開價較近期爲昂、同業手貨亦未願鬆賣、客路以西南川滇帮需胃獨强、滇帮添辦色布·漂布·漂斜·綫呢·府綢·色斜·及印花布疋等貨近二百件、川帮亦辦色布·色斜·府綢·印花布、色丁一千數百疋、浙路溫甬帮訂購期貨下月份怡和粗布二百餘包、價照市高一角、添貨已寡、僅色布·色斜等定貨仍有報裝、香港帮添辦染坏·細斜紋三四十件、本街批發號購漂染用途粗布·細斜·粗斜五十六件</p>
<p>東布昨細布·細斜市盤繼續下挫、良以大結束期轉瞬將屆、客路實銷逐漸冷落、致現貨價格、愈益虛軟、上午龍頭細布每疋跌售十一元八角半嗣以本街某色布字號起而吸收、獨家成交二百餘件、其他細斜·細布各廠搜辦染坯貨近千件左右、下午市盤轉挺、價稍回升、結果細布·細斜較前日每疋降達一角之譜、而期貨行市堅定不鬆、行盤與現盤比例、每疋相差四五角之钜、故各行開貨、絕說問津、</p>
<p>查昨日疋頭出口、有二十件運厦門、十件運汕頭、二件運香港、三百件遝烟台、七十件運天津、</p>
<p>海味　新孟買尾甫到</p>
<p>海蜒螟蜅到貨亦缺</p>
<p>孟買新蝦尾最近始有運到、惟數量不多、昨日某號開出、計高檔爲一百零六元、次者八十七元、身份頗乾、</p>
<p>烟台海蜒到貨久乏、去路零星不斷、刻市普通貨售六十元、其勢殊爲穩健、</p>
<p>浙螟蜅舟山貨更缺、寗波貨須三十四元、後市尙須再漲一二元、</p>
<p>五金　美狹條鐵行銷廣</p>

<p>英艦保護永貞到埠</p>
<p>本市永利輪船公司之英輪永貞號、於上月二十七日、在洋河口與海達·哈發·兩輪同被日艦會同靑島海關巡艦挾持駛靑、旋經英總領事提出交涉、一面派英艦海那馬號駛赴靑島保護、日方即於三十日晨先予釋放、隨於九時許、由英艦護送、逕駛回滬、業於昨晨十時抵埠，停泊浦東隆茂棧、據該輸船員談、此决永貞等三輪、被强迫挾持駛靑實屬毫無法律根據、幸經英領據理交涉、且得英艦駛往保護，故永貞輪在靑、雖遭搜查、但所裝銀鈔並未被其扣留、</p>
<p>海達哈發延遲駛滬</p>
<p>現代社記者昨向蘇北聯運公司探悉、據挪威領署接得電吿、海達·哈發·兩輪、經挪駐靑領事交涉、於前晨十一時獲釋後、原擬即行駛滬、旋因輪中所載燃煤、業已用罄、無法啟捉、當經挪領通知靑島三井煤棧、加裝燃煤、但因靑島港口有風、駁運稍受阻碍、致裝煤不及、須延遲至昨晚或今晨方可啟椗駛滬、將於明後日抵埠、</p>

<p>又海達·哈發·兩輪抵靑後、會遭日方非法搜查並將兩輪所裝由阜運滬之現銀及法幣、悉數扣留、竟擬予以充公、昨續據駐靑領署電吿、關於被抄銀鈔、經挪領繼續交涉、所有法幣、業經如數發還、惟被扣白銀、則日方諉稱須待查明後、方允發還、</p>

<h3>滬甬直航　尙係暫時變通　俟驗訖給證後方可正式航行　堂寶美達兩輪今日由甬駛滬　：統一水脚問題尙待續商：</h3>
<p>自第十集團軍司令部頒布修正浙東通航辦法、對滬甬直航、不再禁止後、謀福·新安納·凉州、德平·等輸、均經先後實行直達駛甬、惟該項直航、乃係暫時性質、須待補行丈量登記手續完畢後、方可正式長期航行、統一貨物水脚案、中意公司表示尙未正式决定、甬定綫輪棠賽美達兩輪、電吿定今日直放來滬、亦將直航滬甬、茲經現代社記者分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>直航尙係臨時變通</p>
<p>浙省軍事當　、前爲加强國防力量、故直布封鎖甬江、禁止滬甬通航、旋經各方請求、亦僅允由溫台兼灣、對於直航、仍行禁阻、直至最近、始行頒布修正浙東通航辦法、准許滬甬恢復直航、故謀福·新安納·凉州·德平·等輪、均經先後實行直達駛甬、惟據現代社記者昨向航業界探得確息、現時各輪、雖准直航、但仍係暫時性質、蓋甬當局鑒於土產積壓頗多、値此大結束期將屆、爲調劑農村經濟、故予變通辦理、惟各輸以二三班爲限、同時在直航期內、即進行補辦丈量手續、並具行駛一年以上限結請領得證書、俟核准後、方可長期航行、吾則仍將制止開航、</p>
<p>棠賽美達由甬駛滬</p>
<p>美商華美公司之棠賽輸·葡商美利公司之美達輸、原駛滬定甬錢、旋於去年十二月二十六日、奉令禁止駛滬、故即專駛甬台綫、棠賽輸於日前曾駛閩裝貨一决、業於昨晨仍返寗波、茲美利公司昨接甬分公司來電報吿、美達輪定今日（二日）由甬直放回滬、並請滬公司預備運甬貨物、察其來電意義、當係業經甬方允准加入行駛滬甬綫、又棠賽輪亦定今日由甬駛滬、大致亦將加人滬甬直航云、又謀福開甬後、於昨日返滬、今晨即可抵埠、</p>
<p>水脚問題尙待續商</p>
<p>據中意輪船公司負責人表示、關於滬甬輪貨物水脚、會於去年五月一日、由太古·禮和·中意·等三公司重行商訂、較戰前酌量增加、嗣後滬甬禁航、中意各輪卽經遵令停駛、至其他輪公司、則或有特殊情形、仍得行駛者、因之提高水脚、較去年公定價格、竟過額高漲、此决恩德·德平·兩輪核准由溫駛甬後、爲减輕客家負擔、故仍照前定水脚收取、並非濫行低跌、至昨日（即三十一日）三公司代表集商統一水脚、僅係交換意見性質、並非正式會議、故尙談不到决定、</p>
<p>客商亟盼減低運費</p>
<p>本市甬帮客商、以最近滬甬直航、實行恢復、而各輪水脚、自應遵照浙省府意旨、酌量减低、以减輕客商負擔、而便利土產運銷、聞將聯呈甬同鄕及寗波商支、衣轉知三公司核辦、又據報關業某領袖語現代社記者、查戰前滬甬水脚、如雜貨每噸祇七元六角、雜糧每担四角二分、油每担一元、塘生担四角六分、麵粉每袋一角、金絲草每件三元一角一分、迨戰事以後、各輪竟相繼漲價、漫無限制、經各方反對後乃有三公司去年五月一日之新太利夫訂定、但仍較戰前高出三倍、現時各公司對水脚價目、有仍維持前訂水脚表之擬議、報關業方面、認為尙屬過昂、故聚盼能酌予減低、</p>

<p>滬市米價繼續高漲</p>
<p>日來內地到滬較之去年十月十一月間减去十分之三四、現每日到貨的六七千包、而滬市供給民食之消費、每日的一萬一千餘包、每日尙虧三四千包、以滬上現時存儲米糧數七十萬包計、亦僅能維持四五個月之民食、故現市米價因銷路增加、內地捐稅繁多、天時陰雨等種種原因、繼續高漲、値茲廢曆年關將屆、米糧當不致回跌、</p>
<p>儲備糧食各省統制</p>

<p>改建之食堂　同時亦可作敎室之用、臥室中己置有雙層鐵床、行將完成之醫院中、闢有隔離病房、並有配取藥物之藥房、據某委員云、該地暫行收容單身男子、待他處修建完成、則將兼收婦孺、每人按月膳宿所費、一約計十七元五角、目前上海猶太難民、約計</p>
<p>二千三百人　能自給者的四百人、故其餘一千九百人、不得不由會方照顧、就目前現象觀之、除有難民一千人巳離意國而起程來滬者以外、此後月餘之內、預料復有一千人將來上海、照料難民兩委員會之代表、定今日（一日）午後開會、討論如何應付赤貧者大批擁來之計劃、星期日（二十九日）搭意郵輪康鐵佛　號到滬之大批難民、因尙未覓得適當居處、故不得不暫居博物園路</p>

<h3>前北平俄籍稅務司來滬　聲述被誣經過　僞當局指與共黨有關勒令出境　渠本人從未接觸政治不値一辯</h3>
<p>大陸報云、前充中政府顧問、近任北平海關稅務司之顧諾凡洛夫及其夫人、在天津被指與共黨有直接關係、而勒令出境、去年十二月三十一日離華北後、己於本月七日抵滬、但直至數日前、始接見記者、渠對在華北被諏各節、均加吾認、查天津「當局」所以將顧氏逮捕、</p>

<h3>「阿四匹靈」　並非通用標章</h3>
<p>中華全國新藥業公會聯合會、本市新藥業公會、前以大德顏料廠、以阿叫匹靈等六商標、呈請註册、當以各該商標、專用範圍不明、或係商品名稱、依法不能專用爲理由、請求經濟部商標局再評定、現經商標局發表第九十二號</p>
<p>再評定書　仍雜持原評决、爲「請求人之請求可成立」、其理由如下、請求人請求再評定唯一之理由、不外謂（Aspirin）及中文「阿四匹靈」商標、已成爲習慣上盡人所習知之藥名、而爲通用之標章、業已失卻商標應有之特別顯著性、違反商標法第一條第二項第十四條、及第二條第五款各規定、被請求人</p>
<p>答辯理由　略謂繫爭廣標、爲共所創造、而該項商標之爲中國一部份人所知悉、乃其努力宣傳之效果、故解决木案關鍵、即在審究該商標是吾已成爲通用標章而已、按某一商標註冊時爲創造之名詞、因其所有人經營與宣傳之努力、而爲社會上一般人所知悉、自於其顯著性並無削减、</p>
<p>其專用權　更不能因而加以限制或禁止、如此爲一般人習知之商標、不得與商標法第二條第五款所規定「習慣上所通用之標章」、混爲一談、至爲明顯、所謂習慣上通用之標章云者」、乃指一種標章、凡經營同一商品者、人人</p>
<p>得而襲用　且在事實上爲通用者而言、因其記爲同業通用、故法律可許一人採爲商標、取得專用權、以禁止他人之援用、請求人所舉「雪舫」商標一案、案情與本案全不相同、「雪舫」一字、習慣上久爲東陽腿業</p>
<p>通用標章　因此不能爲任何人所專用、本案「阿四匹靈」商標、乃被請求人所創造、爲不爭之事實並經依法呈請註冊、取得專用權有年、請求人未能提出證據、證明該項商標爲藥業所通用、僅以其爲一般人所知悉、而空言主張其爲「習慣上所通用之標章」、實無足採、基上論結請求入之請求理由、不能成立、</p>

<h3>名人之吃</h3>
<p>— 一粟</p>
<p>蔣委員長喜食燒鴿，昔在黃埔時，輙赴太平沙之太平館大嚼。葉楚傖氏嗜花生米，允喜飮酒，五年前曾與英大使藍浦森較酒量，結果葉以五十四杯醉倒，而藍則飮至五十五杯亦昏然仆地。</p>
<p>馬君武博士酷嗜烟捲。而馮玉祥氏則反之，昔日統治西北軍時，一日至共秘書長魏某室內，覺有烟氣觸鼻，馮偽爲不知，唯朗誦曰：「你的屋子，又薰又臭，又臭又薰，旣薰且臭，旣臭且薰，薰而又臭，臭而又薰，薰薰臭臭，亦薰亦臭，亦臭亦薰」，言畢，卽掉頭不顧而去，魏某慚愧無地，遂戒烟不吸。</p>
<p>故慈善家王一亭氏吸烟後，每將燃餘之火柴梗藏於火柴盒中，不忍拋棄，當他人吸烟擦火時，卽將火柴梗向之引火燃烟。</p>
<p>毛澤東氏喜食橘子，王寵惠氏喜食瘦油粥，朱德氏喜食饝饅大餅。</p>
<h3>衣外加衣</h3>
<p>— 雙溪一葉</p>
<p>西服向來有大衣，如果穿了西服而沒披上一件大衣，好像羽毛未豐的小鳥一般，寒酸氣還在其决，那種到處要依人的尷尬味，或者要想起：「疾風」裏的「勁草」，到底是不大好找的。其實，大衣有時候並不是爲保體溫，實在是用來維持架子的居多。</p>
<p>目前中國長袍之外，也作興披上一件大衣。這個衣外加衣，觀瞻上自然堂皇得多，而實際上反而彷彿有點「驢蒙虎皮」的模樣，不過大勢所趨，又似乎不能少此一襲。</p>
<p>朋友都說衣外要加衣——大衣。沒有披上大衣，好像未盡穿衣的能事。所以，對於大衣，多數考究衣著的都要作最後的掙扎。其實，何必，其實，何苦。</p>
<p>「减衣」，如果要具體的表現出來的話，那末，應該先减去衣外之衣——大衣。但中國人往往口號多於行動。正面的口號，要有反對的行動來補充。减衣的喊聲方停，馬上父去添衣，好像减衣是只配喊喊的，而添衣就是减衣的注脚。這種矛盾，說來眞痛心。但也無法糾正，祗得聽之而已。如果不聽之，又將怎樣呢？</p>
<p>講到衣服最初的使命，非常簡單，就是：「衣，所以蔽體也」。照道理說起來，蔽體就殽，連保溫都在內，其他枝枝節節的問題，應得捐棄偭空。然而從整潔一滑到華貴之後，差不多把衣的眞正意義，剝削無遺·同時·「狗眼看人低」的也輩出不窮，以爲「歸門三相，第一衣光」，這種情形，根深蒂國的抓住大部份人的心理，於赴兢兢業業，惟衣是區，圖之，圖之，造成社會的虛僞。而且豈但虛偽。</p>
<p>我不是借了「衣外加衣」這個題目來詬病我們的同胞，不過國家到了這個地步，這筆餞，似乎可以省省的。而且看過去，中裝大衣，舶來品實居多數，個人經濟，國家漏巵，在在有關。縱或爲了保體溫，但亦何妨改製絲綿襖子來得更加輕暖呢？</p>
<h3>住的新聲</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>意大利最近對於生活科學的貢獻，就是一種「由日葵」房屋的發明。它會在一個同形的軌道上轉動，使住室永遠對着太陽。其動力乃由位於屋中心的三匹馬力的引擎供給。</p>
<p>在英國唐加斯德地方有一家玻璃旅館。它正宣示了玻璃也可以當作一種建築的材料。外面的牆壁與內部的房問——甚至於地板傢具——統是由各種顏色不同的玻璃製成。其地板乃由許多顏色的小方塊玻璃所組成，走起路來倒並不會滑交。</p>
<p>在芝加哥有一家呌做雪爾斯的白貨店，除了在地層上的櫉窗，與頂層上的辦公室之外，幾乎再看不見一個窗戶了·然而製這所房屋的工程師却說，它的彙溫與光綫非　不會比有窗戶的建築物壊，並且可以在無形中使我們節省了許多。囚日光，烟火，汚漬而損害的商品可以减少了，外面的煩囂也可隔除了，尤其有利的是我們將得到更多的地位來陳列商品呢。</p>
<p>墙壁與屋頂雖可便住室與外界隔開，但　免還有多量　熱會從窗口逸去。美國的玻璃工人爲了想克服這個缺點，已做出了一種雙層玻璃窗，就是在一個窗框裏同時放入兩片玻璃。密閉於其問的死空氣就做了防止熱氣散逸的瘴礙物，並且潮氣也因此而不能進來了。</p>
<h3>不勝羡慕之至</h3>
<p>— 戴蒼奇作</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>冬菰這樣東西，也是菜肴中重要輔佐品之一，差不多是人人愛吃的。只爲先前來自東瀛者居多，大家都不願意吃這是很可敬偑的。但是我國自己也有出產，並非全是舶來品，以瓷器著名的江西省景德鎭，（今名浮梁）就是冬菰的產地，所產冬菰，價廉物美，實在舶來品之上。中上之品，每斤只須一元八角，花菰每斤也不過二元左右。隻隻都很厚實，放在菜肴內同煮，味兒鮮美得很。本來在冬筍上市的時侯，炒二冬一味，是菜館中的時鮮菜，代價很貴的。我就爲了這綠故，經濟菜單中竟不敢把它加入，可是近來價格已便宜下去了；所以本星期中來一樣炒二冬嘗嘗。怎麽呌做炒二冬呢？就是冬筍片炒冬菰。冬菰多用原隻的，似乎又有些不經濟，那麽不妨看每隻的大小，切而爲二或四，可就節省得多了。</p>

<h3>冬季衣料之選擇</h3>
<p>— 雨人</p>
<p>冬、天的衣料，第一要不傳然，才可以使體溫不致向外發散。還有「點呌做」「暖」，「軟」，「輕」，也是不可缺少的。要具備上面的幾項優點，自然非羊毛織物不可了。所以冬季的衣料，要推純毛織品爲第一，其决是絲毛的交織物，棉織物也有相當保持體　的功效。最要不得的是人造絲織的，非但不能維持身體上自有的熱度，並且和上面所說的暖軟輕的三要點，恰相反：又冷，又硬，又重。其實人造絲織品不獨不合做冬天的衣服，即在別的季　裏，也不甚相宜，爲的是不經穿，容易摺皺，允其是要洗的衣服，落水不得。何况人造絲根本是外國貨，目今一般奸商們所進的又大都是私貨。假使我們四千萬同胞，每人有一件人造絲做的衣服的話，平均假定作國幣一元計算，這數目已是驚人，而可以把這一次英美的借款，掃數歸淸了！</p>

<h3>早衰腎虧的必要處置</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>年未至四旬而感覺神經衰弱者統謂早衰　青年若過度自凟或婚後縱慾則本症難免</p>
<p>中國人生命的短促，確無可諱言的。觀以很多的青年，他們都受神經衰弱或腎虧的煩惱，致缺少進取之決心，這不僅是他們個人的損失，實是國家貧弱的主要原因。</p>
<p>關於早衰的病象，如精神不振，易於健忘，稍一操勞即感覺疲乏，入夜難酣睡，頭腦昏眩，記憶力衰退，凡四旬以下的年歲而有此現象者，統謂早衰症。</p>
<p>至於腎虧一症，是指生殖的機能衰頽而言。是遺精，早洩，陰萎，不育等症均屬之，與早衰症於連帶關係，因早衰者，都有此可悲的病象故也。</p>
<p>照理，青年正當元陽充沛之時，決無此種毛病，但因自凟與縱慾的關係，結果，遂釀成了上述的病症</p>
<p>然則，此時發嗵將雄壯動物的青春腺（即睾丸部分）精質。以補入人體。即司促進其繁榮。解除其早衰。而恢復其固有的精力。以獲得返老還童。此即現代醫學最新發明之臟器療法是也。</p>
<p>蓋睾丸爲生殖的重要器官，早衰腎虧即屬此器官發生障礙之故，今若攝取少壯動物的睾丸精質，以培補虧損。確屬最對症的根本辦法。</p>
<p>譬似一個四十歲的人感覺精力衰退。從事此種療法之後，上述之弊害至少可再遲至十年始得發生。其治療成績。在臨床上已有確實之證明。</p>
<p>睾丸精質劑男用『補體康』之應用於臟器聞法者。業已有攸久之歷史。吾輩做醫師者。已準確認出其藥力。廿四小時即生精補腎。故富有活潑其神經及補腎。補血；補腦之數大功能。不論患者之疾是屬於早洩。或神經衰弱。未老先衰。甚至發育不全。婚後不妊。服『補體康』之後。即得回春效果。在一千例中。失望者幾無一有。</p>
<p>『補體康』能發揮卓絕功效的原因，實由於提煉精密，所採取之動物腺素，以猩猩爲主，故功效能凌駕他劑之上。</p>
<p>婦女各症服女用『補體康』</p>
<h3>自凟成習後的遺精療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>自凟惡癖如成爲習慣性之後，則遺精次數亦隨之增加，可促成慢性尿道談，尿道滑漏，精管鬆弛，一見異性，立即遺精，故其人的精力虧損，面色蒼白，發育不全，性社經衰弱，常常頭暈目眩，失眠健忘心中怔忡，耳鳴，盜汗，食慾銳減。心臟及腸胃。雖未發現若何重大病症，但種種障礙隨時皆可襲來。</p>
<p>講到自凟遺精的治療，首重攝生，然後投以德國遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」即可根治，萬一其人因遺精過久體虧過度，可兼以補腦，補腎，補血之德國睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」服之，此在臨床實騐上，素具卓效。全球著名醫師均一致推祟，備加讚揚，尤其成分純潔，提煉精密，決非普通一般的內分泌製劑所可望其項背。</p>

<h3>實踐白濁根治法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>理集結不能離開實際，如其所發之理論，與實際無關，則亦僅有徒托空言，無補事實，此種空頭理論，何足爲貴耶？故凡是科學的理論，總以有實際根據，爲最重要。</p>
<p>近來對於淋病療法，大有如過江之鯽，使患者莫知適從。而不免有徘徊岐路之感。此無異使患者除病苦之外，又重加一層治療問題之痛苦。故吾人以醫家之立塲而言，對於淋病療法之指示，實亦義不容辭也。</p>
<p>我以十數年來之臨床實騐，當然人家所曉得用之淋病治療上之一切療法，余亦無不採用殆遍，所謂局部療法，化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，及號稱三五日可以斷根之白濁藥，均經試用，並詳細記其經過，則上述之各種療法，利害得失，均無一定之標準，蓋此等療法，於實際上多無裨益也。由余實騐，德國彼德博士發明之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，實爲治療淋病者之彗星。蓋此劑係根據非特異療法之原理，採用蛋白體黃色素混合製成，歷經無數次之實騐，逐步改良，始抵於成功。各國醫家及專科花柳病院，均多採爲淋病內服之專藥，如拿威諸國，本爲淋病猖獗之國家，今因「克淋儂」一藥之發明，而其患者之人數。激劇減少。是可證明本劑功效之一班矣。舉凡一般市上成藥，或其他手術所難治，或屢治不愈之白濁，服之尤有功效。蓋一般新藥之治淋，惟有實際殺菌力，始能見效，始能根治。「克淋儂」即是從實際效能中所獲得成功之結晶。故能寰宇風行。外用藥男子可用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書自行洗滌。女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，則奏功尤勝（按「抗淋水」本埠中西太和兩大藥房均售）</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋系之肅清是否即根治？</p>
<p>尿液澄清不足爲證　謂淋病之是否根治，以尿之清濁與否爲斷，實爲危險之舉。事實上一般慢性淋，儘多是小便澄清者，即病家本身，亦感到此種現象，是並不以爲淋病根治之證。原來淋菌一物，體積至小，須超倍之顯微鏡檢查之，方可現出原形，非目力所能及。大概淋菌入慢性後，多潛伏內部，必待人體抵抗力減弱時，始出而活動。如房事，酗酒，劇烈勞動之後，淋菌即行活躍，如此往復不已，必釀成大患。惟當淋病重復發作時，往往有淋系如絮，重見尿而浮游，此尤爲慢性淋之累。</p>
<p>變成他症端宜早治　惟一般人因爲淋　既　　清每怠於根治，故多迸發種種其他症狀，最著者，淋毒性攝護腺炎，精阜炎，膀胱炎，關節炎，尿道狹窄等症，皆由此而起。今欲根本肅清此項淋菌，自非加以徹底根治不爲功。就余個人所見，惟淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，始能膺此重任，而德國靜電療法，及Ｘ線電療交相爲用，尤能發揮「克淋儂」之殺菌抗淋之威力。因「克淋儂」一藥，其殺菌力眞是無遠勿屆，無微不至。不論淋菌淺在粘膜，深在筋骨內層，其殺菌力皆遊刃有餘。故要淋菌根本從速根本解決，非此不能達到眞正目的也　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角</p>
<h3>肺病藥的選擇</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>纏綿之咳嗽，每爲肺病的先兆，爲防肺病起見，迅速根治咳嗽，實爲刻不容緩之圖，余爲肺病專家，已近二十餘年，於肺病之各種症狀，因經騐之多，所以對於何種藥最爲有效，具有十分之把握。無論鎭咳及治療各種癆病，德國「補肺拿爾」一藥，確能勝任而愉快。不論如何頑强執拗性之咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」一藥，於三小時之內，即可鎭咳驅痰，咯痰輕快，並能補肺，功效遠在一般肺病藥之上。凡罹患肺病，感覺服他種藥劑無效者，不妨一試本品，其效力確屬可靠也。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「也有」</h3>
<p>— 度浸</p>
<p>「外國有的，中國也有。」這是我們常說的一句話。「中國有的，外國也有。」這也是我們常說的一句話。然而這兩句話卻是各有各底意義的。</p>
<p>從前榮任公曾經寫過一篇文章，說「Gentleman」是英文中最特別的一個字，而中文中也恰有個特別得完全一樣的「君子」，可見世界上只有中文是最豐富不過的。這議論確也聳聽了一個時期，不過到後來卻終於沒有人理睬了。從前中國流行的外國文只是英文，而梁先生來往的高等華人，嘴裏也只是把「Gentleman」一個字呌得起勁，所以梁先生便有了那樣的一個「煙土披離純」。這種「外國有的，中國也有」的發明，實際上卻並不高明。</p>
<p>不過這種不高明的發明，總還算是沒有扯白。因爲英文中的確有「Gentleman」一個字，而且也的確和中文中的「君子」有點搭得上。最徹底的是另一派底大呌。康有爲到陝西去講演，曾經怒吼著說：孔子也發明過無綫電，而且自己就要著一部書發明孔子底發明。然而直到他死，那部書始終未見出版。這回的「外國有的，中國也有」，結果卻只是「沒有」。</p>
<p>這潮流一到了末代，卻就更加成了騙局。現在上海有些出名的中醫，給人看病時也用起了聽診器，治瘧疾時也呌病人服起了金鷄納霜，嘴裏也很少再說「藥酸屬木入肝，藥苦屬火入心」了，然而卻依然在大罵著西醫。那意思顯然把聽診器和金鷄納霜都歸到了自己「祖傳」的名下。這辦法比從前自然是聰明得多了，靠「外國有的」發了財，再進一步索性說：「外國有的，其實都是中國的！」不但越發徹底，而且還佔了便宜，實在呌人佩服得很。</p>
<p>但是不管怎樣，這種「外國有的，中國也有」，其實也可能勉强說是起源於一種好勝心，雖然後來終於變成了佔便宜，但這個潮流的開創者總還有可以原諒的地方。最沒出息的卻是「中國有的，外國也有。」</p>
<p>中國有麻將，外國也有撲克；中國有「三鞭酒」，外國也有Curacao；中國有纏腳，外國也有束腰；中國有小老婆，外國也有Maitresse……</p>
<p>目的雖然是給自己辯解，但那些東西在外國也確不能說是好東西，沒出息自然到了絕頂。不過就事論事，繼還可以說得過去，只有這潮流一到了末代，就也會成了騙局，而那騙局底特色卻是：用外國底好東西來掩飾自己的不成東西。</p>
<p>過去的例是有的。一位詩人自負是象徵派，做出的詩沒有人能懂，於是便說：「我給你們譯一首外國底名詩，且看好懂不好懂！」詩是眞的譯出來了，據說是法國詩人魏爾冷底「Nocturne　parlsien」，的確讀了使人眼睛發白。但幸而時代已經不是梁任公底時代了，竟然也有人會讀法文，等到把原文一讀，纔發現那首詩本來倒是好懂的。這一來，便揭穿了詩人的秘密，於是詩人悲哀地溜走了，好像直到現在也再不見有象徵派的大作出世。</p>
<p>現在的例也是有的。一批「愛好和平」的偉人在爲「和平奮鬥」，因爲被人罵得沒有法子了，便說：「就是屈辱一下也不要緊，你們難道不知道俄國曾經和外國訂過白萊斯特條約嗎？」這眞比喻得好。「反共」是對的，然而白萊斯特條約卻又是寶貝。不過終於怕也是不行的罷，從有俄國底情形是怎樣，白萊斯特條約到底是甚麽，知道的人已經很多，結果還是騙不過人，只有自己把腦袋一縮完事。</p>
<p>「中國有的，外國也有」，比較「外國有的，中國也有」，根本上便要差一等；所以末代底騙局不但佔不到便宜，而且愈加露出底能的嘴臉來了。</p>
<h3>法西斯武術團的小丑：『看我的把戲！』</h3>
<p>— 蒼奇</p>
<h3>在德國的集中營裏（下）</h3>
<p>— 頑譯</p>
<p>之後，我們舉行「普魯士式體操」，大隊在伯來士的操塲上前進著，「臥倒！」「起立！」那鐵一般的命令迫使每一個囚徒都成爲馴服的羔羊。</p>
<p>我們一天裏也有遊戲的時間，但是所謂遊戲，決不是令我們有很好的休息而是呌我們站立在嚴肅的隊伍裏，學習那國社主義的道德與那第三帝國行動底方針。</p>
<p>到了四點鐘，我們大家都回到營房裏來用晚餐：黑麵包與蔬菜，五點鐘以後的兩小時，允許我們有出門的自由，（所謂出門，當然是在集中營的範圍之內，）每天我們有兩小時的時間可以來談話，但是我們的談話是非常謹愼的。我們往往經過極牠的時期後方能取得那鄰床的囚徒底瞭解而開始自由的譚吐。我們很少知道同居囚犯底眞實的姓名。因爲知道得愈詳細就祗愈增加我們麻煩罷了。有許多似乎知道得很多的囚徒們都被守衛者驅逐出去，他們到那裏去呢？他們去做些什麽？這些都是我們莫名其妙的疑問，我們的精神已經受到摧殘，我們整天的生活都浸沈在經常的恐怕與莫名的恫嚇中，於是，我們連談話的勇氣也被剝奪了。</p>
<p>「兩小時的自由嗎？」做些什麽？香煙，書籍與雜誌都在被禁之例，我們祗能閱讀希特拉底「我之奮鬥」——那納粹機關用來宣傳他們主義的唯一的强制工具。一月中我們祗有一次可以取得一張軍記紙，在嚴密的監視中來寫一封家書；一月中我們也祗能有一次可以拿進外面的一封已經檢查了的信。在我妻子的牠黑邊的信紙上撩亂地報告我家庭方面正在外面運用一切的方法來拯救我出營，六個月來我們從來不知道爲什麽我未經審判而宣告有罪；同時我也不知道我底囚徒生涯幾時可以告終。</p>
<p>一種無形的壓力剝奪著我們囚徒的道德。這裏共有三千個囚徒，雖然在德國，他們卻始終保持著他們純潔的獨立的良心，每種侵害著他們良心的東西都是那引起有計劃的壓迫。我們好像啞子與被驅逐的禽獸一般地被他們支配著，我們被囚在那裏，就是納粹要摧殘那些啞子或被驅逐的禽獸底精神的手段，德州——精神的死滅所！我們僅有的願望卻是固定在一個目標上：謹愼著我們一切的行爲以達到早日自由解放的希望。</p>
<p>這樣直到七時，我們就去就寢，十小時的睡眠時間當然不能算少了，其實，納粹黨員們常常在這睡眠時間來打擾我們，以至使我們不能安心地睡覺。每夜，我們沈浸在黑暗的思潮裏，低聲地訴說著我們彼此的期望與恐懼。後來，營裏流行著一個極大的謠言，說是××業已自殺；×××已被暗殺；同時我們也可以在下星期六獲得自由了！</p>
<p>有許多囚徒因不堪那無謂的打擾，因此索性來自尋短見了。有一個囚徒在灶上秘密地取得一塊錫片，很快地用它來斫斷自己底手腕，於是安靜地，含笑地躺在床上，以至流血而死。有幾個用破布打了結，偷偷地走到外面潮濕的地方，在黑暗中把他們自己吊死了。</p>
<p>這六個月悠牠的歲月緩慢地拖著，每天在那粗暴的景況中慢慢地挨過，這樣的生活一直到我出營後從新乘上那從慕尼黑載我到這裏來的無窗的卡車才終止。</p>
<p>我毫無理由地，也沒有目標地被他們囚禁著，而對於「審判」卻仍沒有消息，最後，一輛列車帶我到哥培雷司去，在那裏，我又被囚禁了一個月以後，才被他們帶到法庭上去。</p>
<p>那由國家律師所選派出來的三位法官宣佈我的罪孽是大逆不道地違返了德國的人民，並且由那位前來訪我嫂嫂的老年婦人作證人。那時，法院有一扇門正半啟著，那裏就站立著我的妻子！在律師的辯護時間內給我倆一個互視的機會，在無言的凝視中，我倆的心幾乎要破裂了！</p>
<p>三位法官以爲我的罪狀應判處四個月的有期徒刑，我在這裏候審的時間卻已經有了七個月，因此這四個月的徒刑總算在我釋放以前必須立一個誓：我在集中營裏的一切所見所聞決在外界保守秘密，若有違反本誓言的行動，願受德國反省院監禁的處分。</p>
<p>我與妻子到伯力門夫領到美國的護照。他們簽發了以後，我就與德國永別了。</p>
<p>直到現在，當我與妻子，朋友們在茶室裏聽到那些關於納粹德國底任何情形的時候，我底心便不自覺得驚跳起來；同時爲了免使旁人聽到，就減低了我談話的聲調。到現在我還不相信自己已經在一個自由自在的國家——美國了！（譯自Collier's）</p>
<h3>偉大的一羣</h3>
<p>— 雁朋</p>
<p>爲著挽救祖國的大難，爲要保衛咱們的家鄉；走！弟兄們，拿起我們鏟鋤來！銀灰色的原野的夜。高高的，矮矮的，談著，笑著，哼著歌曲的一羣黑影，出了冷靜的村落，走向公路上來。</p>
<p>那漫牠的「海鄭公路」，自睢寗第二次淪陷以後，又給敵軍修鋪得整整齊齊，日裏汽車不斷的來往，播散著的汽油臭味在夜間還彷彿能夠聞到。</p>
<p>漫空，星月灑著寒光，風在枯樹上吹著凄切的調子。</p>
<p>「到啦！岳家大橋。」</p>
<p>橋下流水衝激著邊緣的碎石，發出一種清脆的音響，嘩啦嘩啦的……</p>
<p>「來！弟兄們一齊動手，破壞這座橋樑！」</p>
<p>隨著，一羣黑影便散開去。</p>
<p>高高的，矮矮的，揮動著鏟鋤，一起一落，鏗鏗鏘鏘地聲音非常清脆，形成了一種偉大的交響曲！</p>
<p>「唔！老吳！這聲音好聽啵？」</p>
<p>「當然囉！比×機丟彈的響聲來得悅耳！」</p>
<p>「奶奶的：×軍這時正在被窩裏做惡夢啦！」</p>
<p>「嘿！×軍發覺這橋樑壞了，也不會猜出是我們種田人幹的！」</p>
<p>談著，笑著，欣奮地揮動著粗壯的臂膀。</p>
<p>石條，泥塊，不斷地落在水中，迸起一處處破碎的浪花，泛出閃爍的銀光。</p>
<p>「嘩啦！」忽地這樣一響，三孔中間的一段橋樑，整個的塌落下去了。</p>
<p>「嘿嘿！成啦！咱們弟兄再過河西刨公路去！」</p>
<p>一羣黑影涉過了水，不一會在那邊平滑的路面上又揮動鏟鋤。</p>
<p>大家一齊流血汗，哼哈嗨，</p>
<p>抗戰，</p>
<p>那怕霜風吹骨寒！哼哈嗨</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>愉快的歌聲輕輕地蕩漾在沉寂的空中。</p>
<p>「輕些！別太開心，給鬼子聽見了可不是玩的。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>月溜過了中天，颯颯的寒風不住地吹著，</p>
<p>夜深了，鏟鋤更迅速地舞動著……</p>
<p>「好了！天快亮了！」</p>
<p>一羣偉大的黑影，又慢慢地移動起來。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>宴會在正午開始，可是還不到十點鐘，陪客就已陸續的到齊了，大家都想藉此瞻仰一下葉團長的丰采。這些陪客，如合浦小學校校牠盧耀津，醫生金楚南，圖董楊岳梁，和豐木行主人蔡和豐等，都是鎭上有面子的知名人物，走出去就到處有人打招呼的，請他們來作葉團長的陪客，的確不算怎樣辱沒。</p>
<p>因爲時候還早，陪客們就都用談話來消磨光陰，談話的主題不用說都集中在戰事上面，鄉公所裏僅有的一份報紙便成了極珍貴的材料。報上正登載著×軍從金山衛登陸進攻松隱米市渡的消息，但在塲的人對地理形勢都很茫然，不知道金山衛到底在什麽地方，偏是這天的報上沒有地圖，不能幫助大家了解，於是大家便只好亂紛紛的互相猜測著。</p>
<p>『我猜金山衛一定是在瀏河那邊，』圖董楊岳梁肯定地說，一壁伸手摸著他的八字鬍鬚。『不然在軍事上不會有這麽重大的影響。上次一二八上海戰爭，不也是爲了×軍在瀏河登陸才不得不撤退的嗎？』</p>
<p>『也許不見得會在瀏河。』醫生金楚南委婉地說，他是個八面玲瓏的人，顯然不願在言詞間開罪圖董。『要是在瀏河那邊的話，那麽在上海附近打的軍隊，早應該退到崑山青陽港一帶去了，怎麼現在退出了閘北，還堅守滬西和南市呢？』</p>
<p>『我想只怕是在浦東罷。』和豐木行主人蔡和豐正在看報，他順手把報紙摺了起來，卻巴巴的從新聞裏找出「浦南」兩個字，指點給大家看說：『浦南和浦東一定相去不遠，這是個很好的證明。』</p>
<p>『浦南是浦南，浦東是浦東，怎好混爲一談。』楊岳梁不服氣地說，他的生性素來是有些固執的。</p>
<p>可是蔡和豐也不肯讓步，他仍舊堅持己見的說：</p>
<p>『誰知道呢，也許這「南」字本來是「東」字，給手民排錯了的也說不定。』（二）</p>

<h3>別母亂箭是愛國戲</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>別母亂箭，爲崑曲傳奇鐵冠圖中之二齣戲，明末忠臣周遇吉守寗武關獨立難支，因而老母妻子及僕人，一門殉節，周本人亦被李闖亂箭射死，乃爲國盡忠之壯烈戲也。此劇一向名貴，現分數派，崑曲班所演爲正宗嫡傳，高腔班演之，近於崑曲，惟別母臨行時，其妻乘周不意，拔周佩劍自刎，與崑班不同，崑班係周拔劍擲與其妻，暗示令妻自刎者。二簧班所演，亦唱崑曲，原由崑班蛻化而來，惟身段字眼稍有不同耳。</p>
<p>高腔一派，吾曾觀陶顯庭常演此劇，（其下刺虎，則韓世昌演之）二簧班一派，吾觀余叔岩演過，聞係姚增祿所授；（姚彼時扮周母），又見瑞德實演一决，崑曲班一派，往見施傳鎭演數决，茲見鄭傳鑑演此，在傳鈴演亂箭，餘者不論，今評鄭之藝術。</p>
<p>鄭傳鑑扮周遇吉唱得有筋骨，心中有戲，臉上有戲，悲憤之情，完全表現無遺，嗓子雖不潤，高處幷不揭，若有佳喉，必大見出色。工架老到，一手一式，皆有法度，撲火時且有搶背，非常緊張，似稍涉平劇化。憶二十年前陶顯庭於此節係跪步前爬也，亂箭一塲易在傳鈴，被箭之後，再上塲，來一殭尸向後倒，極爲硬扎，亦向來所無。此塲前與一隻虎開打，頗爲可觀，對於武工，雖有平劇之嫌，然不可不謂有進步焉。亂箭數塲易在傳鈐飾之，武工卓絕。</p>
<p>是日除比二齣外，有借餉，借茶，又有朱傳茗張傳芳二人合演之遊園驚夢，而賣座不及小書及新劇之盛，曲高和寡，豈不信歟！</p>
<p>照正史周妻非自刎而死，乃是女英雄，曾帶女兵數百與賊巷戰，力盡刎死。宣統二年，吾遊邳縣之風山，蓋燭之故鄉也，山不甚高，上有周遇吉廟，壁上有畫，即繪寗武關抗戰及殉節始末故事，悉本明史本傳，且有燭夫人統女兵巷戰圖也。山下村落，周姓者多，即遇吉之後裔云。想遇吉一門殉節死，其他房近支尙未絕戶也，俗云『忠臣不絕後』信然。</p>
<p>此劇爲極好愛國戲，關於中華民族獨立者至巨，赫赫千古，可與日月爭光，宜極力宣傳於各社會。吾曾習此劇曲於金君及天津某曲師，（南方人佟曼秋君介紹），未曾演過，實因畏難，聞紅豆館主此劇，係譚鑫培親授，擬就正焉。</p>
<h3>藝人趣味</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>韓蘭根有一個時期居然也被人冠上了「東方勞萊」的雅號，這是怪使小猴子感到痛快的。於是小猴子爲了希望自己的演技酷肖勞萊，不惜花了代價專門去研究勞萊的動作，所以在他的表演的方式上，有許多地方是學了勞萊的樣。不過，這雖然是摹倣，然而也可見小猴子對於藝術的專心了。小猴子未上銀幕之先，他的綽號是「小抖亂」，馬浪路西門路一帶，時常可以看見他橫在馬路當中踢小皮球，一味吃女人的荳腐的。而今享名影壇，架子雖可不搭，派頭却不能不要，每日坐了機器脚踏車撲撲撲的來來往往，確實有點威風。</p>
<p>電景皇后胡蝶，雖然不比少女們的嬌嫩，色相却仍不减當年。她的外觀，雍容華貴，闊綽萬分，實際她的氣量吝嗇得很。她沒有別的女星揮霍的特性，而滿貯深藏，儲蓄是她天成的本領：往往三十個銅板換一角；十角兌一元；積五張一元變五元；集兩張五元變十元；於是百而千，千而萬。別的女星天天鬧恐慌，而她竟是相反。倘使有人問她，她便吿訴你「養子防老，積穀防飢」。這兩句老古話。</p>
<p>老牌大塊頭黃君甫，滬西法華鎭猪肉舖小老板也。家中老是豢養母猪七八，希望牠們死吃懶做的肥長起來，誰知物以類聚，瘦小的黃君甫的身上，竟也胖得像個猪玀了。黃的表情雖然遲鈍呆板，不討導演歡喜，但是依胖賣胖，倒也可以聊充角色，調劑空氣。後來因爲沉溺黑籍，弄得昏天黑地，三餐不給，變老板爲窶人，身體也似太陽底下的雪人般的消瘦下來了。寄語胖黃，回頭是岸。</p>
<p>「掛名的夫妻二是阮玲玉的處女作，從那張片中可以看到王獻齋年輕時代的風流瀟洒。此君因爲天生陰險面目，所以在影片裏他的份兒就是扮壞蛋，做臭人；實在呢。他的做人，眞是阿彌陀佛，凡事必須作揖打躬的好好先生呵。他家住福煦路明德里，愛好無綫電成迷，家中羅列大小收音機數座，成日可可噹噹，彈詞聲充滿他的臥室。</p>
<p>詩人導演孫瑜，南開大學的高材生，不喜說話，成天用冷靜的瞳子瞧人。她愛理想，他所導演的影片裏的材料，便是他唯一理想的備忘錄。他也愛肉感，如「小玩意裏」，如「體育皇后」裏，如「到自然去」裏，女性肥胖的大腿是最普遍的點綴。此何意思呢。他的答語是「因爲台下的覜衆與我同好」！妙哉！</p>

<p>新進坤伶童芷苓，爲天津敎育界名宿童漢俠之女公子，秉賦聰慧，嗜劇成迷，齬齡時即就某伶工處學曲，孜孜矻矻，勤研不報，浸淫數載，進步神速，今則已嶄然露頭角矣。吾友沙大風君，爲評劇界能手，在津頗有文名，見芷苓色藝雙絕，許爲可造，掄揚之文，散見平津各報。芷苓之父，感沙君獎掖之恩，特倩人說項，擬將其女拜於沙君門下，沙君與梨園中人本多往還，於芷苓允爲賞識，今芷苓旣願列爲寄女，自無不樂爲應允，芷苓聞沙君未加拒絕，欣喜欲在，乃於上月十四日親詣天風報館，舉行過房典禮，儀式非常隆重，所到來賓，有王伯龍金老鰥劉雲若諸名士，及津市各界聞人等共六十餘人，濟濟蹌蹌，盛極一時，而席間觥籌交錯，相互勸酒，其情緒尤爲愉快熱烈云。</p>
<p>坤伶金又琴，（前某報載友琴者實誤）自金少保息侯識拔後，聲名爲之一震。最近由少保作主，命又琴赴平，拜列旦角名宿王瑤卿門下，以求深造，瑤卿接少保函，當即允諾，並擇十四日在大馬神廟本宅內舉行拜師典禮。又琴藝本不弱，今後再經王老伶工之親自指導，其造就更無限量矣。</p>
<p>童伶鬚生杜父初，爲名坤伶杜麗雲之胞弟，於夏初由平來滬，因慕蘇少卿君之名，特浼人介紹，請求列爲門墻，蘇君見又初聰穎，納之，並授以譚派戲空城計魚腸劍八義圖洪羊洞打鼓駡曹秦瓊賣馬六齣，作爲見面之禮。最近又初又拜名票友羅曲緣君爲寄父，行禮之日，羅君笑謂又初曰：蘇老師授汝六劇，爲寄父者，至少亦得加倍，茲光爲汝說寳蓮燈一劇，俟寳蓮燈蕆事，再續說坐樓殺媳翠屏山淸官冊諸劇何如？又初聞言，受　若驚，歸吿其乃姊曰：有此兩位「師」一父」，何患不成名角哉？麗雲曰：好自爲之，幸母負兩位大人之栽培也。</p>

<h3>話劇小掌故</h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>中國初期時候的話劇，是由西洋輸入的，而開始於西洋人所辦的學校，民國紀元前十年，即光緒二十八年（1902）已亥冬十一月，上海基督敎的翰書院創演話劇，徐滙公學踵而效之；然所演爲歐西故事，操英法語　僅爲熟諳歐化文字者始能領會。</p>
<p>一九〇三年（光緒二十九年）庚子冬十二月，上海甫洋公學演話劇一次，其時適逢拳亂，編六君子，義和團二劇，就課堂試演，觀衆係南洋及民立師生，——這是話劇在中國田歐化而進化爲「京片子」演唱的第一次。决年，甲辰秋七月，南洋公學及民立中學並演話劇，並即由民立學生在優游聯絡各校師生，剏文友社研究話劇。</p>
<p>一九〇九年宜統兀年己酉冬十二月，蘇州福音醫院學生，聯絡進化團在上海演劇助賑，排演血手印，由院長楊君謀自飾漢樂士大班，演至大班被刺一幕，忽爲飾刺客之陳德耀者所眞殺，後山戲殺定罪，判爲無期徒刑，未幾死於獄。—這是中國話劇界有史以來的一件奇案。</p>
<p>一九一二年（民國元年）　子夏五月，女子參政會演於張園，所演爲女律師，女界鐘等劇，意識在宣傳革命，——這是中國女子話劇的開始。</p>
<h3>「海角游魂」（Algiers）—聯美出品</h3>
<p>— 煒</p>
<p>却爾斯鮑育Charles　Boyer。海蒂拉瑪Hedy　Lamarr.合演。</p>
<p>好塢的電影作風，在一九三八年的春季，就踏進了另一個階段。這個轉變，在大體上講來，是從輕鬆的歌舞的笑片，轉到比較嚴肅的社會風土的深刻性的戲劇。「海角游魂」一片，就可說是在改變作風後的一張先鋒巨片。該片講的是在卡許伯地方的一個著名賊黨領袖莫珂的緊張浪漫生活。莫珂是那塊地方的無冕帝王。警局方面，想盡了千方百計，要拘捕他，可是結果終歸失敗。卡許伯地方，街道狹小，而居住的人，又非常複雜。導演在表演那個地方的特殊的氛圍，和複雜社會背景，是非常努力的。那種濃厚的地方色彩，更增加了不少力量。片中的女主角，是以演「欲燄」Ecstacy著稱的性感明星海蒂拉瑪來充當，在這片裏，她更有比以前偉大的藝術上的犧牲。該片並由中國著名攝影家黃宗沾氏攝製。黃氏特具的藝術，那一個不可捉摸的妙處，叉將展呈在該片之中。</p>

<h3>李阿毛和游藝界</h3>
<p>— 小范</p>
<p>綽號李阿毛博士的笑匠徐卓呆，他和游藝界發生關係，已有相當悠久的歷史。他在日本留學，研究體育，但是回國之後，在體育界服務的時間不多，和游藝界的接獨最長，至今還沒有脫離關係。</p>
<p>他是話劇界，那時還稱文明戲—的先進者，和鄭正秋同時，藝名徐半梅，專門擔任丑角，供給觀衆笑料。當時的括劇，即使是一齣悲劇，中間時常要挿一段笑料，使觀衆換換口味，打破沉悶的。到現在不要說話劇裹已沒有這樣人才，就是平劇界裏的名丑，也能有幾人。現在耍能够知够道話劇掌故的，他便是最合宜的一個。</p>
<p>他對於平劇，雖沒有下過苦功，但是和在優游夏月潤等，曾經創作過電影和平劇的連環劇，成爲一種另有趣味的作風。至今年齡已五十多了，夾緊喉隴，哼幾句「那一日梳裝來照鏡」的唱詞，在隔壁聽着，還當是十六歲小姑娘呢。</p>
<p>他不但親自獻身過銀慕，還和汪優游合資開辦「開心公司」的影片公司，專拍滑稽劇本。開心公司關門之後，他有時做演員，有時做導演，有時做編劇。能演能導能編，眞不愧爲「東方卓別林」。近來他還是時常　寫電影劇本，並且擔任「明星訓練所」的講師。</p>
<p>他在從事游藝界的時候寫作是依舊沒有停止過，他的作風，總脫不了滑稽，幽默，趣味的，笑匠的名字，便是他寫作滑稽小說時得來的。李阿毛是他所寫一篇小說中的主人翁罷了，後來他用了這個名字，創設信箱，以滑稽口吻來答復讀者問題之後，李阿毛之名大噪，比徐卓呆更　亮了。至於他在讀書時候的名字—徐傳霖，知道的人更少了。</p>
<p>國軍西撒之後，他又主編了週刋「現世報」，仍舊一貫以前的滑稽作風，不過換一個「吃豆腐」的上海名詞罷了。「現世報」裏也有「娛樂」一欄，專門登戰游藝界消息，對現在的遊藝界，常有正確的批評和指正。最近又出版了兩秤新年遊戲圖，是「李阿毛白相上海灘」和「豆腐西施逃難圖」，滑稽異常，是舊歷新年中的唯一妙品呢。—李阿毛是從來沒有和遊藝界分離過的怪東西。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（九三）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>兪振庭宜演惡霸圖土誼戲</p>
<p>日來各報競載小毛包兪振庭逝世的消息，的確他的技藝也很有足述的地方。菊笙有五子三女，長子入仕途而早逝，振庭雖是菊笙的决子，但是梨園行都以兪五呼之，這大概是照他三個姐姐連着排下來的。他的三弟及弁而折，四弟贊庭，五弟華庭，都是學的武生一行，而菊笙因爲最愛少子的緣故，很想把所有的絕技傳給華庭。惟華庭年事尙幼，不大用工習練，所以結果並沒得到什麼，這也是很可惜的。振庭先入福壽科班學徒，習鬚生，未幾改學武生，同行因他性情卞急，極似乃父，所以大家就呼彼曰小毛包。論他的玩意，長靠戲非其所宜，短打戲像「蓮花寺」「金錢豹」「白水灘」等，恐較小樓，和玉，二人，猶勝一籌。他最拿手而且極合他性格的戲就是「艷陽樓」了。他去高登，一出塲就與別人兩樣，勾臉固佳，即工架，氣派，個頭，樣樣都邊式，漂亮。後來幾塲開打，振庭身手賺敏，圓轉如旋風一般，凡同他配下手的都趕不上他的迅捷。其實這幾位下手如范實亭，遲月亭，許德義等，全是武行中極負盛名的角兒，允其是武　花許德義那是著名奎派老生許蔭棠的長子，除老去的錢金福不算外，他也算武凈中之第一人了。手頭雖快，但是總較振庭略遜，這也可見他們俞家門的眞實工夫了。老俞自知其子是長於表狀惡霸土豪一類人物的，所以他逕把「長板坡」「四平山」「混元合」「挑華車」這些長靠戲，儘量的傳給小樓，和玉，並且一點都不藏奸。有一次振庭力請其父想演一齣「連環套」老俞即予制止，說這齣戲非汝所長，演出後反倒丟了聲名，此眞所謂「知子者莫如父，」而老兪爲人的狄介正直，大公無私，在古今梨園行裏，實在不可多得。現在振庭死了，前往弔祭的人據說很多，恐怕懷念老兪舊恩的人一定不少，因而才有愛屋及烏之感呢。北平現存武生中有一個孫毓堃，（又名小振庭）能傳兪楊兩人之學，我很願他能力自振作，南來一顯身手，那眞比周一腿（瑞安）等高明得多了。</p>

The Chinese army is intercepting them. (Express News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Chinese Army Discusses the Reasons for the Quiet Front Lines</h3>
<p>Insufficient Strength of the Japanese Armies on All Routes; Tokyo Unable to Send Reinforcements</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson of the Chinese military acknowledged to the press that there were only two thousand Japanese troops on Weizhou Island near Beihai in northern Guangdong, and there were still twenty Japanese warships near Weizhou Island. The military strength of the Japanese army in South China is insufficient to attempt a landing in Beihai. The Japanese army around Guangzhou numbers four or five divisions. There are two Japanese divisions in Guangzhou city, and one Japanese division in Sanshui. The remaining Japanese troops are distributed in various places to respond to the guerrillas. Because the Chinese guerrillas are constantly counterattacking to disrupt the Japanese army. There are nine Japanese divisions in the Wuhan area, and three Japanese divisions west and northwest of Hankou, specializing in dealing with the continued counterattacks of the Chinese guerrilla forces. There is only one Japanese division north of the Yangtze River north of Hankou, preparing for the Chinese army's counterattack from the northeast of Hubei and the southwest of Anhui. There is one Japanese division in each of De'an and Yuezhou, and two Japanese divisions between De'an and Yuezhou. Because the Chinese guerrillas are constantly disrupting them, the Japanese have not withdrawn their troops from central China. The Japanese army in Shanxi is also insufficient to do anything. After the initial decision of the Japanese army between the Yellow River and the Fen River in southwestern Shanxi failed, all the cities in that area have been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in southwestern Shanxi is now attacking the Zhongtiao Mountains along the Tongpu Railway, but there has been no progress, and on the contrary, they have suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army in China once asked Tokyo to send four more divisions of reinforcements, but Tokyo was unable to send reinforcements to China, so the front lines in South China and North China have been very quiet recently. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>The Front Line of Xiu River Again Tends to Be Quiet</p>
<p>Tujiabu: After the Chinese army launched a full-scale attack on the 28th on the Xiu River front line, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese, the front line has become quiet again in the past three days. The Japanese and Chinese armies are confronting each other across the river, occasionally engaging in artillery battles. At about 1:00 PM on the 31st, the Japanese army in Qiujin on the north bank again shelled the Tong'anling area on the south bank of the Chinese side, but this is equivalent to the daily routine of the Xiu River battlefield. The Chinese side suffered no losses and did not retaliate, but every night the Chinese army has small units crossing the river to disrupt the enemy. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle in Sanshui Area, Recovering Le'gang and Zao'gang</h3>
<p>Sihui: On the 31st, the Japanese army in Sanshui crossed the river to invade the west and launched a bloody battle with the Chinese army in the area near the old Sanshui. The Japanese army was extremely fierce, but it could not withstand the heavy blows of the Chinese army and collapsed in a panic. That morning, the Japanese army set up twenty steel cannons in Mumianxu, densely bombarding Le'gang and Zao'gang across the river, firing more than twenty rounds per minute, continuously for half an hour. Then, more than 600 Japanese soldiers were dispatched to forcibly cross the river under the cover of fierce artillery fire, landing at the estuary southeast of the old Sanshui and advancing towards Chinese Le'gang and Zao'gang. The Chinese alert troops immediately met the enemy. However, the Japanese were numerous and the Chinese were few, so they changed to defend the lines of [illegible]. The Japanese continued to attack, and the Chinese army fought bravely. Until noon, the Japanese firepower gradually weakened, and four Japanese aircraft came to attack, circling over the Chinese positions to scout and then dropping bombs to assist in the battle. The Chinese army stood firm and remained steadfast in its defense. The Japanese army could not advance any further. The two sides were deadlocked until dawn this morning, when the Chinese army launched a counterattack under the moonlight. The Japanese army was caught off guard and retreated in a panic, taking advantage of the victory to pursue and kill, and completely recovered Le'gang, Zao'gang and other places. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than a hundred casualties of officers and soldiers, and suffered heavy losses. The Chinese tax police team leader fought bravely and died in battle, and dozens of soldiers were killed and wounded. This morning, more than 300 Japanese soldiers, attached with several artillery pieces, fled from Sanshui to Langgang and shelled Mafang. The Chinese defenders were closely monitoring. By 4:00 PM, most of the Japanese had retreated to Sanshui, leaving only a few on guard. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Movement to Rescue Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai, due to its special location, accommodated many wounded soldiers in various hospitals during the early stages of the war. At that time, the general public paid close attention to the care, comfort, and emergency relief of wounded soldiers. However, after the war moved away from Shanghai, Shanghai became merely a refuge area for refugees. As a result, refugee relief became a major issue in Shanghai society. Even now, with only a small number of refugees remaining, generous philanthropists from China and abroad are still loudly appealing for donations to provide relief. However, news about the relief of wounded soldiers has not been heard for a long time. In fact, the seriousness of the wounded soldier relief issue, compared to the relief of a small number of refugees in Shanghai, is actually even more important. Because the war zone is expanding and the war is prolonged, the number of wounded soldiers will only increase day by day. The cost of medical care and supplies needed by these brave men who are wounded for the country is enormous! On the government side, of course, there are also considerable funds available, but to seek thorough relief, and to quickly alleviate the suffering of countless wounded soldiers struggling in flesh and blood, it is necessary for the wealthy people of the whole country to work hard to expand the relief movement. Shanghai, at present, is naturally still the leading wealth concentration area in China, so launching this movement by Shanghai society will certainly have a considerable and huge effect.</p>
<p>We must know the motivation for relieving refugees does not entirely stem from a humanitarian standpoint; moreover, during the course of the war, relieving wounded soldiers with combat capabilities has a far-reaching impact on the future of the war of resistance! Wounded soldiers, in terms of military skills and courage, are generally far superior to new recruits. If they can be quickly treated, recover from their injuries, and return to their units, their effectiveness will naturally be far greater than recruiting new troops to replenish the ranks. This is a direct way to strengthen China's ability to resist Japan. Now, because the facilities for rescuing wounded soldiers in the war zone are incomplete, many unnecessary sacrifices are often encountered. If the rescue facilities can be improved, it can avoid wounded soldiers rolling in ditches and wandering on the roads, countless heartbreaking and tragic tragedies, which is also a way to indirectly preserve the strength of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>However, the necessity of the wounded soldier relief movement is known to all; what is lacking now is an organized effort to carry it out. We often see in Shanghai newspapers foreign news reporters' war zone dispatches, emphasizing the pain of Chinese wounded soldiers in the war zone and the urgent need for relief, and saying that many wounded soldiers could have been saved, but they died because medical treatment was too late, and even saying that wealthy people who do not donate money to rescue these enthusiastic, patriotic, and injured heroes are committing a crime. Are there not many wealthy merchants and magnates in Shanghai? And since the outbreak of the war, due to the increase in the population seeking refuge, there are also quite a few people who have made fortunes from the national crisis. In recent years, there have been many industrial and commercial firms that have made a lot of wartime profits, including the textile industry and others in the concession areas. There are certainly no lack of patriots among them, who should take the lead in donating large amounts of money to the national fund for rescuing wounded soldiers; and various public legal bodies should also uphold their usual enthusiasm for relieving refugees to support the implementation of this new movement. Why hasn't anyone initiated this important movement yet?</p>
<p>Moreover, those who have money should immediately donate money, and those who have strength should also contribute their strength. The most powerful people to rescue wounded soldiers are, of course, medical and nursing talents. Now, medical rescue personnel from the League of Nations, as well as foreigners from India, the Philippines, and other places, are still voluntarily participating in Chinese battlefield service. We have also seen recently that the wife of the Czech Minister of Health almost died in an effort to manufacture and donate cholera vaccine for Chinese wounded soldiers. How can we not feel ashamed to death! Is it possible that Chinese people love their own country less than foreigners love China? No! No! We believe that as long as someone initiates this wounded soldier relief movement, many enthusiastic people in Shanghai's famous medical organizations, such as the Chinese Medical Association, will certainly not let foreign medical professionals monopolize the limelight, and some will also go to the battlefield to serve and do their best for the country. As for the large amount of medical supplies needed, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association will also solicit donations from its members. Even overseas Chinese can collect suitable medical supplies, taking advantage of the convenience of their locations. For example, quinine is in great demand on the Chinese battlefield, and in the past, it could only be bought at high prices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, but the Dutch East Indies, where many overseas Chinese are located, produce the most. Wouldn't it be convenient and appropriate to donate it wholesale?</p>
<p>However, in the entire wounded soldier relief movement, "giving money" is still more important than "giving strength," because with money, you can control manpower. Medical facilities can be purchased and completed accordingly, and even the wounded soldiers' nutrition and sanitation can be properly arranged. Let's see what large-scale measures the enthusiastic and patriotic people of Shanghai society will use to promote this most important "wounded soldier relief movement" at present?</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu Refuses to Take Up a Puppet Post</h3>
<p>Not Subject to Any Threats or Inducements</p>
<p>The People of Tianjin and Beijing are Greatly Relieved to Hear This</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tianjin News: Japan's attempts to induce Wu Peifu to take up a puppet post have been very fierce. A few days ago, it instigated ruffians in Tianjin and Beijing to send telegrams in support of Wu, and spread rumors that Wu had accepted a certain puppet post, and arranged for more than 130 Chinese and foreign reporters to meet with Wu on the 30th. Beforehand, the Japanese special service agency prepared a draft of the conversation to be released on the spot. Unexpectedly, the content of Wu's conversation during the meeting was completely contrary to the Japanese-prepared original draft. Wu not only did not express his intention to accept, but also put forward three conditions, saying that true peace could not be achieved without these conditions. The foreign reporters were all astonished, and the supervising personnel also changed color. They immediately ordered the inspection agency to withhold the foreign reporters' telegrams, and at the same time copied and issued the Japanese-prepared conversation through the Domei News Agency in an attempt to cover up the situation. Wu's attitude is very firm, and he disregards any threats or inducements. The people of Tianjin and Beijing are greatly relieved to hear this. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Beijing: Wu Peifu, whom the Japanese are eager to confer a puppet post on, met with foreign reporters in his private residence today, under the strict protection of Chinese and Japanese guards, but did not specify his position, only stating the benefits of peace, and said that he had received requests from Chinese and Japanese friends to come forward and lead the peace movement, but to make peace a success, he must have the strength and the ability to promote peace. Judging from the slightly dissatisfied reaction of various Japanese circles to Wu's words, Wu has not yet been induced by the Japanese. According to reliable sources, Wu's demands include: organizing a strong Chinese army, completely under Wu's command; returning real power in China to the hands of the Chinese people. Judging from the translation of Wu's statements, it does contain the second proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Beijing: Wu Peifu, a Chinese Confucian general, issued a statement to 150 newspaper reporters here today, stating that he himself has not accepted any new position, nor is he prepared to come out and accept any new position. Wu first said, "Foreigners say that because I love peace, some people want me to come out and lead the peace movement. My friends also encourage me to come out of the mountains. However, I want to lead to true peace, and three prerequisites must be fulfilled first. We must have real military force, we must have real political power, and a suitable location. As for the location, of course Beijing is the best. I may be slightly popular in Beijing. The problem is whether I have real political power. I have heard rumors that the Japanese military is willing to return real political power to the Chinese people. I also believe that peace will be difficult to achieve unless Japan does this." Judging from this oral statement of Wu, it can be seen that the saying in the Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days that Wu Peifu has actively participated in the so-called "peace" movement is actually just a one-sided wish of a certain party. (Associated Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Beijing: Wu Peifu said to newspaper reporters today that his actions have always been aimed at peace, and at the same time, he showed the reporters the texts of ancient Chinese philosophical works that he had collected in Sichuan to oppose communism, as well as his own anti-communist poems written yesterday, and said that if you read them, you will know that communism is not suitable for China's national conditions. Also, there were some differences between the record of Wu's conversation and the Japanese English translation, because Wu went back into the inner room after talking to the newspaper reporters and did not answer any questions. But later he suddenly handed over a written statement, which vaguely stated, "I intend to save the country from collapse, and it is indeed time to seek permanent peace. Some people want me to take on the important task of appeasement. I am old and weak, and I am afraid I cannot bear it. However, since I am a citizen, it is my duty to strive for peace, so I will only do my duty in the future, so as not to disappoint the people of the country. I believe that if the Provisional Government and the Reformed Government can cooperate with each other, and at the same time, can gain the good sympathy of the Japanese government and its military, then peace can be gradually achieved." However, as far as the Associated Press knows, this statement was actually drafted by a group of pseudo-officials who persuaded Wu to come out, because Wu at the time stated that he would not issue a written statement, but only made an oral statement. Therefore, it is impossible for Wu's side to verify whether this written statement was actually issued by Wu himself. Also, when reporters, including foreign reporters, visited Wu, they were severely searched by Japanese and puppet military police. (Associated Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>New China Daily Praises the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>An Important Conference of Historical Significance: Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Will Continue to Advance</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today's Communist Party organ, the New China Daily, published a commentary praising the resolutions of the Kuomintang Fifth Plenary Session. It stated that the Kuomintang Fifth Plenary Session and the Communist Party's Sixth Enlarged Conference echoed each other, promoting unity and continued resistance against Japan in the same spirit. The newspaper stated, "Under the principle of intensifying unity, no matter what practical ways the two parties cooperate, we believe that the cooperation between the two parties will continue to progress based on the current relationship between the two parties. From the perspective of the Kuomintang's own progress and national unity, the recent Kuomintang Fifth Plenary Session is an important conference of historical significance." Communist Party sources believe that this article was written by a senior Communist Party representative in this area, indicating that the Communist Party fully supports the Kuomintang's resolutions and does not object to the Kuomintang's rejection of the Communist Party's proposal to participate in both parties' memberships.

<p>Japanese Side Monopolizes Hankou Water and Electricity Businesses</p>
<p>Hankou - The contract signed on January 28th between the "Hankou Branch of Central China Water and Electricity Company" and Mr. Duberry, Director of Special District Three (i.e., the former British Concession), can be regarded as the first concrete manifestation of Japan's formal recognition of the Chen Youren-O'Malley Agreement, and proves that the Chinese Water and Electricity Company has been merged by the Japanese Electrical Monopoly. It is reported that the Japanese side did not force Special District Three to sign this agreement, but instead proposed a method by which the Japanese side directly collects water fees from the residents of Special District Three. If this is the case, then the Chen-O'Malley Agreement is tantamount to being invalidated. It is said that the contract does not stipulate that the price rate should be calculated according to the user as determined by the company, but only that the quantity consumed by Japanese military and civilians in the area should be deducted from the total amount supplied to the area. The contract period is six months, and either party can cancel it with one month's notice. It is reported that the British Consul-General has notified the Japanese Consul-General, declaring that the British government reserves its rights under the Chen-O'Malley Agreement. The current water price has increased by 55% compared to before. In addition, by changing Chinese legal tender to Japanese gold, the Japanese side has actually doubled the water price. The newly stipulated water price is one Japanese gold yuan per thousand gallons. Special District One and Jardine Matheson Properties are also supplied with electricity by the company.

<p>Guo Shoushan and Others Heroically Sacrificed Themselves for Their Country</p>
<p>Xi'an - Military news: Guo Shoushan, a sergeant of the Fifth Company of the Second Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the China Guerrilla Force, was 23 years old and a native of Wayaocun Village, Zhaocheng. In the autumn of last year, he and his younger brother Guo Shouhai joined the Dare-to-Die Corps due to resentment of Japanese oppression. His bravery and patriotism were admired by the entire battalion. In December of last year, he was assigned to reconnoiter the Japanese situation in the city. He took the opportunity to be introduced by his father and voluntarily entered the traitor school to conduct secret work. He and his father, Guo Junjie, who assisted him in his work, were quickly arrested by the Japanese army. After interrogation and torture by the Japanese army, the two men were bruised and battered, but they firmly refused to reveal the truth about the Chinese army and scolded them severely. Under shame and anger, the Japanese army even used iron hammers to knock out their teeth one by one. Guo Shoushan's hair was completely pulled out. On the morning of December 13, Guo Shoushan and his father, Guo Junjie, were brutally murdered by the Japanese army next to the Dongyue Temple outside the East Gate of Zhaocheng. When they were executed, both father and son shouted "Down with Japanese Imperialism! Long live the Liberation of the Republic of China!" His entire family of seven had been killed by traitors beforehand, and his wife was subsequently raped. The heroic sacrifice of his family is truly commendable. (Dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3>One of the Most Exciting Scenes of the Japanese Diet's Interrogation on the War</h3>
<p>The Prolongation of the War and Unfavorable International Situation, Domestic Anxiety Clearly Visible</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: The interrogation on the war at the Budget General Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 31st was quite sharp. First, Bei Lingji, formerly affiliated with the Orient Association and now affiliated with the Civil Administration Party, asked, "China is friendly with Britain and the United States and hostile to Japan. Is it not because of defects in Japan's diplomatic measures?" Arita was quite embarrassed, but replied, "The fact that Sino-Japanese relations cannot be adjusted and that this decision has become increasingly profound is due to very complex reasons." Bei asked, "Does the cabinet intend to take resolute measures against the British and American policy?" Arita replied, "The Konoe statement has already indicated the goal, and now is not the time to take resolute measures." From this, it can be seen that the diplomatic line taken by Arita is still the old line of Hirota. The reason why he does not take resolute measures is not that he does not want to, but that he cannot. Sato, a member of the Seiyukai, asked, "What is the meaning of Konoe's statement that he does not want to demand compensation?" Arita replied, "The losses of the country can certainly not demand compensation, but the losses of individuals cannot but demand compensation." Bei also asked, "How much is the amount of compensation?" Arita replied, "The exact amount has not yet been calculated." From this question and answer, it can be known that Konoe's statement that he would not demand compensation is actually a deceptive statement. Compensating for personal losses is a disguised form of compensation. Arita has revealed it all. Xiaochu, a member of the Civil Administration Party, asked about the relationship between Japan and the National Government. The questions and answers from both sides were all old stories and had no meaning. Xiaochu then turned to question the foreign exchange policy, saying, "Why does Japan still insist on the exchange rate of one shilling and two pence against the pound?" Ishiwatari replied, "The current exchange rate is very proper and beneficial, and there is no need to change it." Since the start of the war, the price of Japanese foreign exchange has fluctuated. Because its government would rather suffer losses than give up the exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, foreign exchange can still be maintained with difficulty. Recently, some financiers in the country have advocated lowering the legal exchange rate, but its authorities are maintaining the old rate in order to avoid a collapse in foreign exchange. This question and answer can make it clear. Xiaoshan also raised an important question, saying that in order for Japan to make its true intentions clear to all countries, it should convene an international conference in Tokyo, inviting Britain and the United States, and if necessary, also inviting Germany and Italy to jointly discuss the East Asian issue. This proposal has its own deep meaning, and seems to want to seek an end to the Sino-Japanese war through an international conference. Hiranuma replied, "There is a need to explain Japan's true intentions, but there are no plans to convene an international conference at this time." Hiranuma's answer was very suggestive, and seemed to be mostly supportive. Arita replied, "It is also doubtful whether convening this international conference can make the third country understand. It is more effective to have a cordial meeting with the representatives of the countries concerned stationed in Japan." However, Xiaoshan expressed deep dissatisfaction with the replies of Hiranuma and Arita, and still advocated convening an international conference as soon as possible. Finally, Arita replied, "Japan's determination has been repeatedly expressed to the outside world and there is no need to convene a meeting again." Xiaoshan also asked, "Last year, Japan asked the French ambassador to China to submit four principles for resolving the incident to China. I don't know if the current cabinet is still considering them." Arita replied, "The current bald cabinet continues to implement the Konoe cabinet's China policy." The debate then came to an end. This section was one of the most exciting scenes of the 31st. The domestic concern about the international situation and the anxiety caused by the prolongation of the war are clearly visible. (Dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - When the House of Representatives debated the budget案 this morning, the main events discussed included strengthening the participation of political parties in the cabinet, a proposal to convene a conference of overseas Japanese in Tokyo, the difference between the policies of the former and current Army and Foreign Ministers on the China Incident, the compensation that can be demanded from China, and the benefits of third countries in China, etc. Seiji from the Seiyukai took the floor first, saying that Prime Minister Hiranuma had guaranteed to respect political parties and asked to quickly grant more positions in the cabinet to party members, so as to realize the policy of national unity to serve the emperor. The Prime Minister replied that the whole country is always loyal to the emperor under the constitutional government, and the size of its activities does not depend on the number of positions. When he formed the cabinet, he implemented the policy of talent without distinguishing between parties. Segoe then proposed convening a conference of overseas Japanese representatives in Tokyo to show Japan's policy on the China Incident. The Prime Minister replied that he was unable to give a definite answer to this proposal at this time. Segoe continued to explain that the opinions of the former and current Army and Foreign Ministers regarding the compensation that can be demanded from China were quite different, and Japan's policy on the China Incident has changed every time the cabinet is changed, so that the outside world has the impression that Japan has no fixed policy. He also asked, "The losses caused by Japan's military operations in China will not be compensated. What kind of answer did General Chiang Kai-shek give to the four points for resolving the China Incident proposed by the former Foreign Minister Hirota?" Foreign Minister Arita replied, "I do not know the details of the conditions submitted to the Chiang Kai-shek government by the former German ambassador. As for Japan's policy on the China Incident, it is unchangeable. Prime Minister Konoe has stated this in his declaration on December 22. Konoe's declaration is slightly different from the previous declarations issued by the government, but this is due to changes in the situation. Konoe's declaration is still valid today, and the government's policy has not changed since December 22." The Foreign Minister also revealed that the government's policy is that foreigners will not be compensated for the losses they suffered due to Japan's military operations in China. Fan Gu then criticized the government's secret policies after the outbreak of the China Incident, and urged the government to recognize the rights and interests enjoyed by third countries in China who hinder Japan's just cause and assist the Chiang Kai-shek government. In his reply, the Foreign Minister reiterated the policy of respecting the interests of third countries in China as much as possible. Then, Army Minister Itagaki stated that the government is confident in its ability to maintain peace and order in China in the future, and said that the situation in North China has greatly improved as a result of the efforts of the Japanese expeditionary force.

<h3>The United States Decides to Take Various Steps to Actively Aid Civilized Countries</h3>
<p>To Confront European Dictatorships: America's First Line of Defense is in France</p>
<p>New York - Today's newspapers carried shocking news about President Roosevelt's meeting with the Senate Military Affairs Committee yesterday. The New York Times stated that after the members left the meeting, they all had the impression that the US President would take all possible steps except war to safeguard the civilized countries of Europe and confront the dictatorships. It is reported that the US President asked the members to regard France as the actual border of the Americas in the inevitable conflict between the civilized countries and the dictatorships. The New York Daily News recorded roughly the same, also mentioning the US President's remarks about the border between the American and European continents during the war, and said that the President had a concrete understanding that there was active support between the United States and the civilized countries of Europe. The leading leaders of the civilized countries of Europe all know the position of the US President, etc. It is also said that the US President's convocation of the Senate Military Affairs Committee is a first in nearly 25 years. The reason for this move is to explain the reason why he allowed American aircraft manufacturers to sell new-style aircraft to France. After hearing the President's words, the members left in silence. It is reported that the President said that he did not expect to see a day when American troops would go abroad to fight again, but he felt that the United States must do what it can to preserve Britain and France. The New York Daily News also said that several senators felt that it was not appropriate to hide anything from the American people at this time, but because they swore to keep secrets, they were quite unhappy. A member said that the President's opinion on the world situation was truly shocking, but the President thought that the situation he observed was extremely serious, and he was afraid that the American people would be shocked by it, so he advised the members to keep the secret and not reveal what he said to the outside world. Last night, some members ignored their words and directly published them in the newspapers, saying that President Roosevelt had stated that the United States selling aircraft to France was in line with American foreign policy, because aiding civilized countries was one of the general purposes of American foreign policy. The President also stated that since he is the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, he has the right to allow the sale of aircraft and is fully responsible, so the Military Affairs Committee should not continue its investigation into the sale of aircraft to France. Furthermore, the US government has encouraged foreign governments to purchase aircraft from the United States in the past two years. As for how to encourage it, and whether this encouragement is applied to all relevant foreign governments, the President did not elaborate. According to the United Press, Senator King has repeatedly criticized the government, but is now one of the supporters of the President. It is reported that King said that he hopes to have an understanding to sell aircraft to Britain and France, and that this move does not violate neutrality. At the same time, President Roosevelt also expressed concern about the national socialism that is invading Latin America, advocating expanding American trade to defeat national socialism.

<p>German Newspapers Criticize</p>
<p>Berlin - President Roosevelt's statement has been commented on by German newspapers. "The People's Observer" stated, "President Roosevelt despises American law. His supply of aircraft to France has actually constituted a rare inferiority in the American government's behavior." The Evening News used the headline "Is the American Border on the Rhine River?" "After Hitler first gave a speech advocating peace, President Roosevelt actually had this unbelievable provocative act." The newspaper's correspondent in New York declared, "President Roosevelt's actions are the only ones seen since the European War, and it is appropriate to call him Wilson II. The United States has now abandoned its neutral policy, and Washington has become the provocative center of the war against omnipotent regimes since yesterday." (Havas Dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<p>Transformation into a Military Alliance: Difficult to Achieve for a While</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: Japanese envoys to European countries recently met in Paris to discuss the issue of whether the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Communist Pact should be revised into a military alliance treaty to deal with the civilized countries of Western Europe at the same time. It is reported that to deal with Britain. It is reported that according to well-informed sources here, the envoys have different opinions. Therefore, this decision-making meeting only exchanged information. It will be necessary to continue to meet several times before recommending specific policies to the Tokyo government. In general, regarding anti-Soviet actions, if Japan cannot come out to participate and assume definite tasks, it will be difficult to achieve military coordination between Germany, Italy, and Japan for a while. If Germany and Italy have an affair with the Soviet Union and have affairs in the Mediterranean, military coordination may not be achieved either. (Dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<p>London – Yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to questions in the House of Commons regarding the situation in China, stated that the only significant event in China in recent weeks was the Japanese government's announcement on December 22nd of the revised peace terms it could accept, and the Chinese government's rejection of them. There have been no major changes in the military situation, except that Chinese guerrillas in North China have become more active, causing temporary disruptions to railway traffic in several places.

<p>Cambridge – The Cambridge University Student Union held a meeting yesterday to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue and passed a resolution stating, "This Union condemns the government for failing to effectively address Japan's attempt to establish a new order in the Far East." The Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland, immediately delivered a speech in response. (See separate dispatch.) He stated that the government believes it is inappropriate to act hastily in the Far East. In his personal opinion, hasty action under certain circumstances could trigger a world war.

<h3>Japanese Finances</h3>
<p>Runaway Inflation, Industry and Commerce in Decline</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a Havas news agency report from New Delhi, Japan's financial difficulties have reached the point of runaway inflation, which is made even more credible by its new budget reaching a massive 10 billion yen. The amount of paper money issued by the country was 1 billion yen in 1932, but has recently increased to 2 billion yen, while industry and commerce have declined. The abnormal development of military industries is of no benefit and is even harmful to ordinary industry and commerce. Its production is decreasing daily, while price indices are increasing. According to statistics published by the Bank of Japan, the retail price index, assuming 1914 to be 100, was 174 in June 1937, and rose to 203 in the same month last year. The standard of living in 1937 was 194, but rose to 211 last year. The severity of the crisis is self-evident. Moreover, the new massive budget is sufficient to exacerbate this crisis. Based on this, industry and commerce in the Japanese-occupied areas of China will inevitably be desolate, and there is little hope for improvement. Disputes between Japan and various related countries will also become increasingly serious, it can be asserted. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Gayda's Article</h3>
<p>Attempt to Control the Mediterranean, Italian Ambition Clearly Visible</p>
<p>Berlin – Gayda, the editor-in-chief of the "Giornale d'Italia" and a senator, published an article yesterday in the organ of the German Hitler Youth, revealing Italy's objectives in the Mediterranean. The article strongly advocated the policy of the German-Italian axis, naturally designating German interests in Southeast Europe and Italian interests in the Mediterranean. It went on to say that both Britain and France hold anti-Italian policies in the Mediterranean, which was evident during the Abyssinian War. However, as a result, Italy not only gained territory but also achieved political victory in the Mediterranean. Gayda acknowledged that the British government under Chamberlain is more conciliatory, but is still actively expanding its military. After the Abyssinian War, Britain felt there were only two paths: one was to open a new sea route to India via the United States, and the other was to concentrate its navy in the Mediterranean to be able to repel attacks from any direction. As a result, the second path was adopted. France also has the same objective, but in a more selfish way. The Mediterranean is France's shortest route to the East and Africa. France is preparing to conscript 1.5 million black soldiers from Africa to fight in France if it goes to war with Germany and Italy. Gayda believes that this is France's imperial attempt to threaten Europe. At the same time, the mass conscription of black people violates the principles of European culture. After attacking Britain and France, Gayda declared that the strength of the Italian army, the relationship of solidarity with Germany, the agreement with Yugoslavia, and the friendship with various Arab countries can counteract this anti-Italian policy. Therefore, "Italian policy is aimed at defending against British and French aggression." Moreover, the colonies of Britain and France are only for military and political purposes, while Italy is burdened with overpopulation. Therefore, in order to protect its national interests in the Mediterranean, Italy is determined to prevent all "future threats." (Haitong Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Eastern Newspaper's Commentary</h3>
<p>Axis of Aggression, Three in One</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers are generally satisfied with Hitler's speech in the Reichstag, especially with the two points in Hitler's speech concerning the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Sino-Japanese War. According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun", a local newspaper, in its commentary on Hitler's speech, Germany's dissatisfaction with Britain and France stems from their inability to treat Germany fairly, and their hope that Germany will always be in distress and unable to become a strong country. The newspaper believes that Hitler's speech regarding East Asia is very reasonable, and praises Hitler's ability to establish the Anti-Comintern Pact, forming a united front between Japan, Germany and Italy to jointly oppose communism. The newspaper also said that Britain and France should, in principle, promptly return to Germany what they had seized in the past, in response to Hitler's demand for the return of old colonies. However, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" did not mention the fact that the islands in the Pacific mandated to Japan were formerly owned by Germany. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" also said that if Britain hopes to achieve its own peace and security, it should acknowledge Germany's right to exist. The newspaper then discussed the peace declaration made by Germany and France in November, saying that this is a manifestation of Hitler's policy of appeasement, but Hitler will never turn a blind eye to the unfair treatment he is currently suffering because of this declaration, and it is not logically sound. Finally, the newspaper stated that Germany is prepared to support Italy's demands for colonies from France, because Italy supported Germany when it took action in Austria and Czechoslovakia last year, so Hitler is now reciprocating.

<h3>Soviet Union Announces Outline of Draft Revised Party Constitution</h3>
<p>Recruitment of Party Members Should Eliminate Class Differences, and Suggests Abolishing Periodic Mass Purges</p>
<p>Moscow – The outline of the draft revised Party Constitution, which Zhdanov will report at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (to be convened on March 10), was recently published by local newspapers. The report first suggests that because the class boundaries among the working people of the Soviet Union have been eliminated, and the economic and political contradictions between workers, peasants, and intellectuals are gradually being eliminated and tend to disappear, the conditions for the Communist Party to recruit new party members should be revised. Currently, the procedures for recruiting party members are divided into four classes according to the social status of the applicant. This method is clearly inconsistent with the class structure of Soviet society since the victory of socialism. Therefore, the report proposes to abolish the current class distinctions in the recruitment of party members. In the future, when new party members join, whether they are workers, peasants, or intellectuals, the procedures should be the same. The report then proposes to add a clause on the rights of party members to the Party Constitution. In the past, these rights were considered self-evident and were not listed in the Party Constitution. The new clause should stipulate that party members have the right to criticize any party staff at party meetings, to elect and be elected into party organs, and to request to attend and participate whenever their activities or behaviors are discussed and decided upon, and to submit any questions or statements to any party organization, including the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party. The report then proposes to abolish the periodic mass purges, because this method was adopted at the beginning of the New Economic Policy and there is no reason for its continued existence. In practice, experience has proven that this method cannot individually examine party members, and as a result, it is ineffective against opposing elements who are good at concealing themselves, while it expels loyal and conscious party members on the grounds of being passive. The report suggests that when deciding on the expulsion of party membership, a very cautious and caring attitude towards comrades must be adopted, the reasons for the accusations against party members must be carefully investigated, the rights of party members must be protected from being harmed by any arbitrary actions, and expulsion of party membership should be used as the party's highest punishment, only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The report also proposes to include in the Party Constitution the various measures that the Party has already implemented to ensure the practical realization of democracy within the Party, such as secret ballots in Party elections, prohibition of elections by list, Party members can freely criticize and attack candidates, and convene meetings of active workers of city and district Party committees on a regular basis. Because the primary organizational task of the Party is the correct selection of cadres and the investigation of the implementation status of resolutions, the report suggests that a Cadre Department be established under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and Cadre Departments be established under the provincial and regional Party committees, the central committees of the Party in the national republics, and the city and district committees.</p>
<p>In order to raise the Party's propaganda and agitation work to the proper level, the report suggests that a Propaganda and Agitation Department be established under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and Propaganda and Agitation Departments be established under the provincial and regional Party committees, the central committees of the Party in the national republics, and the city and district committees.</p>
<p>Because the pace of the Party and national life is accelerating, and in order to address urgent issues in the Party's policy, the report proposes that at least one plenary meeting of representatives from local Party departments across the Soviet Union be convened each year to make a resolution, and that the meeting be empowered to recall members of the Central Committee who fail to effectively fulfill their responsibilities and replace them with other members, provided that the number does not exceed one-fifth of the number of Central Committee members elected by the Party Congress. The decisions of the aforementioned meeting, with the exception of the replacement of Central Committee members, must be approved by the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Because the Party's basic organizations have become increasingly strong and are increasingly closely related to practical administrative and cultural work, the report suggests that in order to strengthen the position of each basic organization within each production unit, including state-owned and collective farms, and to increase their degree of responsibility to each unit, these organizations should be granted the right to supervise the work of the administrative organizations of each unit. The Party organizations in the People's Committees, due to the special working conditions of the Soviet organs, cannot implement supervision, must notify the Central Committee of the Party and the leading staff of the People's Committees of the shortcomings in the work of the People's Committees and their respective members.</p>
<p>In order to create conditions for promoting new cadres to leading positions within the Party, the report suggests that the minimum Party record for secretaries of provincial and regional committees and central committees of national republics be five years or more (previously twelve years), and the minimum Party record for secretaries of lower-level Party departments should also be shortened accordingly.

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Passes Bill</h3>
<p>Extending Mandatory Military Service</p>
<p>Current Troop Levels for Army and Air Force Deemed Necessary to Increase</p>
<p>Paris – Because of the reduced birth rate during the European War, the government previously promulgated a law in 1936 stipulating that the duration of mandatory military service should be increased from one and a half years to two years until 1940, in order to make up for the shortfall. The Chamber of Deputies also passed a bill this afternoon stipulating that the two-year military service system will continue to apply after 1940, thus becoming a permanent measure. In addition, a bill was passed stipulating that the training period for soldiers in the army reserve should not be extended, but their numbers should be increased. During the discussion, the reporter of the conscription bill, Isner, delivered a speech saying that the German army currently has 900,000 active troops. The active troop level of the French army headquarters is only 450,000. In addition, since the establishment of the German-Italian axis, the northeastern and southeastern borders of France must be defended simultaneously. After the military equipment is fully equipped and fortifications are added to the border, the army personnel also need to be increased. Therefore, for various reasons, the current active troop level must be increased to 550,000 to be sufficient. The need to increase the current number of officers and soldiers in the anti-aircraft artillery and air force is even more important. The Minister of Aviation, Lai Shangboer, then gave a speech on France's order of airplanes from the United States, saying, "What our country has ordered is the best American airplane, which should be attributed to President Roosevelt." The monthly production of French aircraft factories is currently 90 units, which can be increased to 100 units. (Havas Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Government Plans New War Risk Law</h3>
<p>Specifies Compensation Methods for Damage Suffered in War</p>
<p>London – Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered his first important speech in the House of Commons regarding war risk insurance, saying that the government has considered methods of paying compensation to those who die or are injured as a result of air raids and other war actions. A plan has now been drafted, including casualties among civilians and commercial ships. The payment of compensation will not be delayed until after the end of the emergency period. In addition, a plan for the emergency revitalization of property in central locations, including housing, has been drafted. Plans for marine war risk insurance and war risk insurance for various goods between ships and warehouses will be announced soon. The government has drafted an insurance plan for maintaining the various major land goods necessary for people's lives during wartime, including export trade, and premiums will be collected. This plan will be forcibly implemented during wartime. Retail merchants who store various major goods will insure each item to avoid losses. The government's conclusion is that the principle of implementing war risk insurance should regard this loss or injury as not only related to those who directly suffer it, but must be regarded as the concern of the entire people. Simon continued, regarding various private properties, there have been suggestions that the government establish an insurance plan, collecting insurance from each property owner, and then bear all the compensation in the event of any damage. This proposal has been thoroughly reviewed and found to be a difficulty that is not easy to overcome in practice, that is, there is no possible basis for accurate calculation. However, this does not mean that the government will not pay attention to the losses of individuals, and will provide higher compensation depending on the situation of the country after the war. Once the extent of private property losses has been ascertained, if circumstances permit, compensation will be made from public funds in accordance with regulations sufficient to fully reimburse some limit of their losses, so there will be gradations. A compensation committee will be established soon, headed by a British judge. As for the collection of compensation claims and the recording of damages, they will be handled by the appraisers of the Inland Revenue Department. (Reuters Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Spanish Government Forces Repeatedly Repulse Enemy Offensives Relying on Natural Defenses, Little Change on Various Fronts</h3>
<p>Girona – The Spanish Government Ministry of National Defense issued a war report last night stating that on the Catalonia front, government forces have been quite successful in the battles at the Querino and Arrans positions. The Italian divisions of the Nationalist forces have attacked several times, but have all been repulsed. The Nationalist forces then dispatched German and Italian aircraft to assist in the battle, fiercely attacking the positions of the government forces. The government forces resisted desperately, and have not abandoned important strongholds so far. On the Estremadura front, government forces have also repeatedly repulsed enemy offensives, and the positions have not changed so far. On other fronts, the fighting has been quiet. (Haitong Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Barcelona – It was announced here last night that the Spanish Nationalist forces advanced 120 kilometers in northern Catalonia yesterday. They encountered determined resistance from the government forces at various important strongholds. It is expected that the government forces will take advantage of the natural defenses in the mountainous areas to reorganize their positions and prepare to fight a desperate battle with the Nationalist forces. The government forces on the Vich front are also resisting strongly, because if the Nationalist forces break through the front line there, the government forces in that area will be in danger of being surrounded, and the natural defenses outside the mountains will be completely ineffective.

<h3>Germany Desires Peace, Britain Genuinely Shares the Sentiment</h3>
<p>Chamberlain's Speech Echoes Hitler</p>
<p>International Negotiations Considered Premature</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, outlining the current foreign policy, stating, "Hitler has expressed a strong desire for mutual trust and cooperation between the British and German nations. I welcome this expression, and I would like to take this opportunity to state that the British government and people fully share this sentiment." Although the British and German governments are not currently considering any negotiations, it is gratifying that representatives of both countries' industries are currently engaged in talks. Regarding Hitler's entire speech yesterday, "I personally believe that the speaker is not one who is preparing to incite another crisis in Europe. He has even repeatedly expressed that a peaceful situation is necessary for Germany, a view shared by us." I believe that all international issues can be resolved through negotiations, "But if the international atmosphere is not good, then proceeding with negotiations to resolve disputes, satisfy desires, and eliminate grievances will be futile. In other words, when conducting negotiations, if those involved do not believe that all participants are pursuing peace and earnestly hope for a peaceful solution, and are not harboring ulterior motives, it will be of no avail. After a long period of anxiety and concern, European countries are now gradually restoring confidence. I would like to inform the world that what we want to see is not only a desire for peace, but also to find more concrete evidence before reaching a final solution. In other words, even if countries cannot disarm, they should at least have the intention of limiting armaments. If such an opportunity arises, the entire British people will not only sympathize with it, but will also do their utmost to ease the general situation in Europe. This can be stated with certainty," he said. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London - During yesterday's House of Commons debate on foreign affairs, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared, "We are now beginning to see the effects of our long-term preparations for rearmament. The public in all areas now feels that our efforts have greatly increased our defense capabilities. Our prestige abroad has never been higher than it is today, and our friendship has never been as eagerly sought by other countries as it is today. The claim made by Attlee a moment ago that the policy of appeasement has failed is inaccurate. In fact, I am still making it progress gradually."</p>
<p>Reiterating the Relationship between Britain and France</p>
<p>"I hope that our visit to Rome has strengthened the friendship between Britain and Italy, while not weakening our relationship with France. The closeness and intimacy of the relationship between Britain and France is almost unprecedented in our memory. Moreover, this relationship is now based on mutual trust, which is far different from what it used to be."</p>
<p>The House of Commons reconvened today after the Christmas recess, and the general public expected a debate on foreign affairs and eagerly wanted to hear it. Therefore, the House was packed, and both the public and private galleries were full. The diplomatic corps seats were also filled. The debate began after the question period, led by opposition leader Attlee.</p>
<p>Satisfied with Herr Hitler's Speech</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said in his speech that the British government was greatly satisfied with the recent declarations of France and Germany, and that the excessive panic and predictions seen in the general newspapers before Hitler's speech have now been dispelled by the facts. Herr Hitler's speech was very long, involving many events and covering a wide range. I do not presume to say that I have had time to study it sentence by sentence with caution, but I can say that I definitely have the impression that it was a speech not issued by someone who is preparing to throw Europe into another crisis. I believe that many sections of the speech indicate that Germany urgently needs peace, just like other countries. We all have our own internal problems, our own economic or financial problems, or unemployment problems in one country, or other problems in other countries. Politicians of all countries should concentrate on improving the conditions of their own people today. None of us can fail to sympathize with this view." Before mentioning Hitler's speech, the Prime Minister had also referred to it in his answer during the question period.</p>
<p>In his answer, the Prime Minister said that he welcomed the section of Herr Hitler's speech in which he expressed his strong desire for mutual trust and cooperation between the British and German peoples. "I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the British government and people share this sentiment. The British government is not currently considering negotiations with Germany, but is very pleased to declare that representatives of the two countries' industries have recently held a discussion on many industrial matters."</p>
<p>Adhering to the Policy of Non-Intervention</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "The policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is proceeding satisfactorily, and it is not yet time to change this policy. I do not believe that the current situation in Spain is enough to endanger the peace of Europe, but I would like to state clearly that any large-scale intervention at this time would inevitably lead to the expansion of war in Europe and be a disaster for peace. This is why the government is unwilling to change its policy of non-intervention."</p>
<p>Refuting the Opposition Party's Remarks</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then addressed the opposition leader Attlee's claim that General Franco's victory would pose a military threat to Britain, saying that the Foreign Secretary and himself, while recently in Rome, received renewed assurances from Mussolini and Count Ciano that once the Spanish Civil War ended, Italy would not make any demands on Spain. Hitler also made the same assurances. As for the Spanish refugees, the government has done its best to help them, and will continue to do so in the future. He hopes that General Franco will allow the establishment of a neutral and safe zone to accommodate women, children, and the wounded. It is heard that the French government is working hard with the Spanish government to deal with this matter. The Prime Minister criticized the opposition party for not taking the worst possible view of the will of the leaders of totalitarian countries, for not making all sorts of illusions about uncertain rumors to frighten themselves, and for not making all sorts of nitpicking remarks about Britain's strength. He believes that although the problems between countries are serious, there is nothing that cannot be resolved through discussion, but he must add that if the atmosphere has not improved, and if those engaged in discussion do not feel that those present are all willing to obtain a peaceful solution, and do not harbor malicious intentions in their hearts, then it is impossible to proceed with discussion to eliminate differences of opinion, fulfill desires, and dispel grievances.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister refuted the opposition party's disbelief in the statements made by Mussolini and Hitler, saying, "For those who give assurances that the speaker will keep their word, there is no worse way than to tell people, 'Don't believe them. Your actions can be based on your assumption that the person will not keep their word.' I dare say that Attlee is mistaken. Before we proceed with a final solution, we want to see clear evidence from all sides that they are willing to form an alliance, if not an alliance to disarm, then an alliance to limit armaments. Once this opportunity arises, if we can see everywhere a spirit that is in line with our own, then I know that Britain must be prepared to contribute to general appeasement." (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Report on the Visit to Rome</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons yesterday on his visit to Rome, saying that Mussolini, during the Anglo-Italian talks, had guaranteed that he had no demands on Spain. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also reiterated Mussolini's guarantee, saying that Italy had no territorial ambitions for any Spanish territory. We cannot regard the discussions in formal meetings or negotiations as containing exploratory or informal natures. Therefore, the general impression he received was that Mussolini first clearly stated that Italy's policy was peace, and that he would be happy to use his power to uphold peace when necessary. Mussolini further explained that the Berlin-Rome Axis was the key to Italian foreign policy, and we similarly explained that Anglo-French cooperation was the foundation of British policy, the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister continued, "Mussolini expressed satisfaction with the terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and repeatedly and solemnly reiterated Italy's willingness to abide by the obligations stipulated in the agreement. We know that the biggest obstacle between France and Italy is the Spanish issue, so it seems unlikely that the negotiations between France and Italy will yield any results before the end of the Spanish Civil War. Regarding arms reduction, Mussolini agreed that the first step was to implement qualitative restrictions. Mussolini believes that the Jewish question is international in nature and must be dealt with generously." Zhang said that the atmosphere during the Anglo-Italian talks was extremely harmonious. It is difficult to expect that all the points of contention and opinions raised by both sides will be accepted by the other side. Therefore, although it is impossible to report that both sides have agreed on all points during the talks, the purpose of the talks has indeed been achieved. Zhang finally mentioned the meeting with the Pope, saying that he and Halifax were deeply moved by the courage and humanitarian spirit shown in the Pope's demeanor and actions.

<h3>Labor Party and Liberal Party Criticize the Government</h3>
<p>Blindly Accommodating and Tolerating, Only Encouraging Aggression</p>
<p>London - During yesterday's House of Commons debate on foreign affairs, opposition leader Attlee began with the Spanish issue. Attlee said that when the Prime Minister mentioned that Mussolini was committed to peace, the people of Great Britain were even more moved because Mussolini had interfered in the Spanish war for at least two and a half years. The Prime Minister should be aware that general public opinion in Britain is increasingly dissatisfied with the attitude taken by the British government in the entire Spanish war. Italy's own declarations and the facts are obvious, but it is foolish to try to cover up Italy's assistance to the Nationalists in the offensive taken in Catalonia. More than half of the troops attacking Barcelona were Italians. The Italians have celebrated the fall of Barcelona as a great victory for Italy. The actions of the British government in the entire Spanish issue, except for the Nyon Agreement which was barely satisfactory, have all definitely encouraged the aggressors.</p>
<p>Liberal opposition leader Sinclair rose to speak, saying that although there is no reason to take a pessimistic view, the government's lack of policy is indeed not reassuring. Although we are rearming on the one hand, we have lost the assistance of important and powerful forces overseas. We could rely on this force to resist aggression a few months ago, but now the Rome-Berlin Axis has become a geographical and military reality on the map of Europe, dividing Europe into two major parts, east and west. Britain should now show its position of adopting freedom and international goodwill, with neither shame nor fear. We are willing to help the German, Italian and other peoples establish a just and upright world order. Prime Minister Chamberlain has now added a debt to the cause of peace. The Prime Minister has made a large part of the German and Italian people believe in the goodwill and peaceful intentions of himself and all those who protect Britain. Many people in Germany and Italy have found the symbols of politeness, tolerance and calmness under the Prime Minister and his umbrella, and when comparing it with the proud attitude of the rulers of the totalitarian countries, they feel its beauty.</p>
<p>Labor Party leader Greenwood then rose to speak, ending the debate. It is said that we should know that 130 British ships have been attacked by Franco's troops, and the protests made by Britain have all been ignored. Intervention in the Spanish war has been strengthened. The position of the British government is indeed very abnormal, because it believes that supplying the Spanish government with military supplies may promote war between countries, while Germany and Italy's clear assistance to Franco can achieve peace. As for the claim that all of Franco's large quantities of weapons were obtained as prisoners, it is absurd. In fact, they were all provided by the two countries with whom our Prime Minister cooperates most closely. Greenwood concluded by saying that the danger of war lies only in two people, namely Hitler and Mussolini. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Remarks Greatly Reassure People</h3>
<p>Paris Expresses Gratification</p>
<p>Berlin Newspapers Unanimously Praise</p>
<p>Berlin - German newspapers unanimously praised the speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that the speech was delivered 24 hours after Hitler addressed the Reichstag, so it can be regarded as a positive response from the British authorities. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung wrote, "Among Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, the German side should be satisfied with what Herr Hitler said. In addition, the British opposition leader actually misinterpreted what Herr Hitler said, 'If another country goes to war with Italy, no matter what the motive, Germany will definitely help Italy.' It is especially commendable that Prime Minister Chamberlain has effectively corrected this." The Hamburger Fremdenblatt wrote, "Prime Minister Chamberlain has fully expressed the thoughts of people around the world after Herr Hitler delivered his speech. The fastest official response from foreign politicians is like this, so it is known that the lasting and fair policy of peace advocated by Herr Hitler has won a victory. In addition, there is one point in Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech that cannot be ignored, that is, the general professional pessimists are blinded by the long-standing prejudice against the totalitarian countries in Europe. Therefore, they thought that Herr Hitler's speech yesterday was about to cause a crisis. Now, Prime Minister Chamberlain's words have refuted their falsehoods." (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - Berlin newspapers published news about the news, all under the following and similar headlines: "London Changes Attitude", "The Nightmare is Over", "The World Gains an Exceptionally Deep Impression". The Deutsche Tageszeitung wrote, "Germany's contribution to the reorganization of Europe has made accurate remarks at the appropriate time. We must wait eagerly and see how other politicians receive the direction of German foreign policy and how they accept it. The German local newspaper warned the world not to misunderstand Herr Hitler's speech, saying that the huge problem has never lost its seriousness, urgency and strength. However, this problem has been raised in a way that puts the opponents in a bad position from the beginning. Those who thought they were distributing the world, that is, the powerful country in one country's business, namely Britain, have definitely felt it." (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - The speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday was warmly welcomed by France, and it was agreed to welcome the Prime Minister's clear statement on Anglo-French cooperation, believing that the Prime Minister's speech was greatly reassuring. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - After German Herr Hitler delivered a speech yesterday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons today in response. Responsible persons here said that these two speeches are greatly beneficial to the convening of an international peace conference to resolve the issues of colonies and arms reduction, but it is necessary for Italian Minister Mussolini not to block the door of the policy of appeasement before it can be done. Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that he would conduct negotiations in order to achieve a general solution. The goal is to adapt the German viewpoint to the policies pursued by Britain and France. This policy was determined by former French Prime Minister Chautemps and former Foreign Minister Delbos when they visited London in November 1937. In other words, the colonial issue must be considered within the scope of a general solution, and the arms reduction issue should also be included in the scope of a general solution. Responsible persons here also said that it is noteworthy that Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet advocated the convening of an international peace conference in their speeches in the Chamber of Deputies a few days ago, and German Herr Hitler did not oppose this. How this matter will develop in the future will naturally be judged by what demands Italian Minister Mussolini will make at the meeting of the Fascist Party's Supreme Council on the fourth of next month (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Founding of the Fascist Party Army</h3>
<p>Nationwide Celebration Mussolini Holds Military Parade</p>
<p>Rome - Today is the 16th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party Army. Flags are hung throughout the country to celebrate, and military parades are held. The celebration here was held in front of the graves of the war dead in the European war, and the situation was very enthusiastic. Prime Minister Mussolini, wearing the uniform of the commander of the Party Army, first presented medals to the families of the Party Army soldiers who died in the Abyssinian and Spanish campaigns, and then reviewed 20,000 Party Army members. The audience was very crowded, and they cheered and saluted the Prime Minister. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London, New York, Berlin - Stock Prices Soar</p>
<p>London - Today's stock market prices have all soared, which proves that the people of this city have calmed down after Hitler's speech was published, and they feel satisfied with the relatively moderate tone of Herr Hitler's speech. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - Hitler's speech was more moderate than expected, so Wall Street's financial market rose by three pounds. Prime Minister Chamberlain's hopeful tone also made the market slightly optimistic. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - Hitler's mention of "a long period of peace" has given a very good impression here. In the Berlin Stock Exchange, general securities have all seen an increase, and stocks and securities have increased by one pound to two pounds. Political figures expressed satisfaction with Britain's satisfaction with Herr Hitler's speech, but they were quite doubtful whether Britain had drawn the correct conclusion from this speech. Many people said that Herr Hitler did not clearly raise the colonial issue in this decision, but only wanted to put this issue aside again. Political figures solemnly declared that Herr Hitler clearly recognized this as an issue that must be resolved, so they planned to start a major propaganda campaign on the colonial issue. The German people, who had been silent for a long time, would now revive their "colonial consciousness," which would begin today. Jews and churches felt that Herr Hitler's speech was quite unfavorable to them, and even threatened them. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>All Overseas Chinese in San Francisco Actively Raise Funds to Relieve Compatriots in Distress</h3>
<p>Aiming to Raise One Million US Dollars, Promoting an Embargo on War Materials to Japan</p>
<p>A special dispatch from the Continental Daily, San Francisco, January 14, states that the United Chinese War Relief Association of San Francisco is enthusiastically conducting a campaign to raise one million US dollars to relieve Chinese refugees. It has already raised US$30,000 in cash, and pledges have reached US$200,000. On December 6th of last year, the Association held a meeting attended by more than 300 overseas Chinese men and women, and passed a resolution stating, "We sincerely support the National Government and resist the enemy to the end. We will abide by the Association's regulations and continue the fundraising campaign until the goal of one million US dollars is reached." During the meeting, the overseas Chinese unanimously declared, "If we do not abide by the Association's regulations or refuse to collect funds, we are willing to accept the most severe punishment from the Association." Then, the overseas Chinese attending the meeting, except for a team formed by women, were divided into eleven teams. Each team held a flag, each taking one character from the phrase "American Overseas Chinese Cooperate to Save China," and walked slowly through the streets of Chinatown, singing patriotic songs, and starting the first day of work. Overseas Chinese teenagers and youths here have been preparing a few days ago to mail anti-Japanese printed matter to 6,000 famous American beauties and overseas Chinese in the United States. The printed matter contains a booklet entitled "Japan's Ally is the United States," which laments that the United States donates food and medicine to China on one hand, while supplying Japan with war materials on the other. Each booklet includes a postcard addressed to President Roosevelt at the White House. The postcard is mailed to Washington by the recipients of the booklet. The booklet also includes a short note saying, "Greetings to you and President Roosevelt. We hope that you will promote an embargo on war materials to Japan, so that the Chinese people will be more pleased next year." The Association's campaign will last for ten months. During this period, every overseas Chinese in San Francisco can expect to donate at least US$50, either paid in full at once or in ten installments. Those who are exempt from paying are limited to the old, weak, poor, sick, or unemployed. The campaign will focus on soliciting public pledges for the first five days, and will begin automatic pledges from this year onwards. Those who donate in cash at that time will be given a red badge for identification. If the staff of this campaign are absent without reason, they will be fined US$2.50 per absence. If they request an exemption or are unable to pay after pledging, a committee will investigate their personal circumstances. According to Tang Jun (transliteration), chairman of the Association, the previous two fundraising campaigns for relief work in China have raised US$1.6 million, equivalent to 10 million Chinese currency. The first campaign lasted from August 20th to November 20th of the previous year, and the second lasted from November 21st to December 4th of last year. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shi sent a telegram to the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco, which was forwarded to the headquarters of the Association, publicly endorsing the work.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade in Yantai under Japanese Control Suffers a Blow</h3>
<p>Guerrillas in the Suburbs Attack from Time to Time</p>
<p>Few Italian Overseas Chinese Actually Set Up a New Consulate</p>
<p>A special dispatch from the Continental Daily correspondent in Yantai, January 17, states that in the peaceful city of Yantai, Japanese merchants are gathered, and it has been controlled by Japanese sailors and "managed" by a puppet government controlled by the Japanese. Yantai is also the target of frequent guerrilla attacks. Japan once fired cannons to bombard it last year, but foreign expatriates believe that Yantai is still more fortunate than other occupied cities. The business community here is gloomy and the future is bleak. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the summer of the previous year, the people in this area of Shandong have indeed ignited a patriotic heart that has not been seen for hundreds of years. Not long ago, the Japanese overseas Chinese in Yantai had to withdraw in a hurry. According to the order of Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province at the time, strong fortifications were built in the suburbs of this city, and perfect preparations were made to resist attacks. The Chamber of Commerce contributed 30,000 yuan to build ten concrete and steel-framed fortresses on the seaside to defend against naval attacks. The fortresses were built very well and still stand today. However, the Chinese side had no intention of defending Yantai, so the entire army withdrew one day, and it took half a month for the Japanese army to arrive. However, the Japanese army soon went elsewhere, and 600 Japanese sailors and Manchukuo soldiers were stationed there. In the past year, Japanese merchants have returned to Yantai one after another, and the number of Japanese overseas Chinese has greatly increased compared to before the war. All port affairs are controlled by the Japanese, and the import and export tax rates have been changed, which of course gives Japanese goods preferential treatment. Foreign trade was initially prosperous, but when exchange control was implemented, export activities suffered a serious blow. Not long after Yantai was occupied, a consualte of Italy was established, which was a first in the history of Yantai and caused quite a surprise among foreign expatriates, because there were only three Italian expatriates in Yantai. Although the guerrillas have inferior guns, they attack from time to time in the suburbs of Yantai, causing the invaders to disappear. Therefore, the Japanese army has built solid sandbag obstacles on the nearby mountains. The Japanese army has formed a puppet government in Yantai, the same as in Tianjin and Nanjing, hanging five-color flags. Before the war, the chief consuls in Yantai were often British and American consuls, but now the Japanese side has obtained the title of "chief consul."</p>
<h3>Mass Mobilization Forces of Various Counties in Northern Jiangsu Complete Reorganization and Gradually Become Regularized</h3>
<p>Monthly Salaries Issued; On-the-Spot Exactions Strictly Prohibited</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Assigns Qi Shuzu as Magistrate of Xinghua County</p>
<p>Taixian Dispatch: The headquarters of the Northern Jiangsu ×th Guerrilla Zone and various units have successively completed reorganization. All salaries will be uniformly issued from provincial funds, and local militias will also be funded by the county governments. A public notice was specifically issued yesterday, strictly prohibiting the pretext of raising funds to demand from the people. The notice is recorded below: "Since the fall of Jiangnan, the people of various counties have gathered under righteous banners, with numerous units. Procuring salaries, weapons, and uniforms has been difficult. Some units have occasionally raised funds from the people on their own to meet urgent needs. Under the circumstances at the time, it was a last resort and understandable. However, the people in the war zone have suffered greatly, and the floods along the canal are becoming increasingly severe. How can the survivors bear further burdens? Now, all units in this area have successively completed reorganization and are gradually becoming regularized. All salaries will henceforth be issued by the provincial government, and local militias will also be funded by the county governments on a monthly basis. Other military supplies will be centrally managed and distributed by this headquarters, so there is no need to worry about shortages. From now on, no unit is allowed to use the pretext of raising funds to demand from the people, in order to prevent disturbances and alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely punished according to military law once discovered, without leniency. In addition to separate orders, this public notice is issued for general knowledge. Let everyone abide by it and not violate it."</p>
<p>Eliminating Sea Bandits: The coastal ports of Yancheng, Dongtai, and other counties in the northern region have long been areas where sea bandits gather, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, kidnapping and extorting ransoms, which has been frequently heard of. However, since Commander Zhang of the Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Security Corps led his troops to station there, he has, on the one hand, dispatched teams to patrol the sea, so that the bandits have nowhere to hide, and on the other hand, dispatched troops to strictly search and suppress them, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles with the bandits, rescuing kidnap victims, and capturing bandit leaders. In just a few months, the coastal area has become peaceful, and the nearby people have sung praises endlessly. Recently, Yuan Xiangchen, the independent battalion commander of the corps, Shen Yueting, the seventh battalion commander, together with Deng Famai, the ninth company commander of the third battalion, and Lu Chaoqun, the artillery team leader, encountered bandits in Nanlinjiadun while patrolling the sea and engaged in a fierce battle. In addition to the capture of seven bandit leaders, including Chen Qingxiang, all the rest were killed, two bandit ships and several guns were seized, and two kidnap victims were rescued. The two battalion commanders, Shen and Yuan, have already presented the situation of suppressing the bandits to Commander Zhang for review and handling.</p>
<p>Qingtai Telephone Communication: The long-distance telephone between Taixian and Qingjiangpu used to be connected via Yangzhou, but since the fall of Yangzhou, it has become increasingly delayed. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Exchange requested and was approved to set up a telephone line from Gaoyou to Fanchuan to Taixian. It has now been completed and tested, and the sound is very clear. A branch office has also been established in Fanchuan to open for business. The toll from Qingjiangpu to Taixian is 86 cents per call. It is also heard that the vacancy of Xinghua County Magistrate, which was originally held concurrently by Jin Zonghua, the Administrative Inspector of the district, has now been filled by Qi Shuzu, who has been appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government as the magistrate of the county. Jin Zonghua will then serve exclusively as the Inspector and concurrently as the District Security Commander. It is said that Qi has already left the province for Xinghua to take up his new post.</p>

<h3>Production and Sales of Sichuan Province Commodities in the Second Year of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Reduced Imports Due to Difficult Transportation</p>
<p>Sales of Local Products Still Inevitably Suffer from Stagnation</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: Sichuan is the province with the richest products and the largest consumption volume in the southwestern provinces. Chongqing can be regarded as the general hub for the collection and distribution of all native products of Sichuan and Kang provinces, as well as parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Gansu provinces, and imported commodities. Exported commodities have always been dominated by tung oil, silk, bristles, wool, medicinal materials, and sheepskins. Imported commodities have always been dominated by cotton yarn, piece goods, Soviet goods, hardware, dried vegetables, pigments, and Western medicine. In addition, there are two kinds of products with extremely high output, sold in this province, neighboring provinces, and the Far East: Sichuan salt and Sichuan earth. In Chongqing, they can only be listed as commodities similar to transit trade, but the total business volume is higher than that of general import and export goods. Sichuan earth, in the process of being banned for six years, still seems to hold the leading position in the Chongqing market. After the start of the war, exported commodities, initially with Hong Kong, Hankou, and the Yangtze River traffic not yet obstructed, the export volume was still considerable. Later, with the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic and the inconsistent foreign exchange settlement prices, which were unfavorable to the operation of the export industry, the export volume inevitably declined greatly for a time. Domestic trade has also changed from time to time due to the different scope of sales markets. Most of the imported goods have also reduced the amount of intake and changed their appearance due to transportation difficulties and changes in the route of arrival. Wool, one of the exported goods, even lost its original position last year and became an unimportant commodity. Recently, although it is estimated that since the War of Resistance, the capital flowing into Sichuan Province should be in the range of 150 million to 200 million yuan, the various machines transported into Sichuan Province are indeed more than 100,000 tons, and various technical experts have also gathered in Sichuan Province. There are dozens or hundreds of factories and firms that have moved to Sichuan, but the functions of transporting and selling local products and supplying necessities have not yet been fully demonstrated. Local products still inevitably have a sense of stagnation, and the items needed by the people still inevitably have a sense of lack. This is really a great opportunity for entrepreneurs from all over the country to come to Sichuan to engage in industry and commerce. Please describe the general situation of the production and sales of various important commodities in Chongqing in the twenty-seventh year for the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Exported Goods</p>
<p>Tung oil, which has always occupied the first place in the export value of Sichuan Province, is in great demand in the international market. At the peak of sales, it could be 700,000 dan per year, with a total value of more than 25 million yuan. Last year, 330,000 dan were shipped out, with a total value of more than 16 million yuan. After the interruption of the Guangdong-Hankou traffic, the average monthly export value was only about 1% of what it was before the interruption. As a result, the sales volume was greatly reduced, and the oil price even fell from more than 50 yuan per dan to 17 or 18 yuan at one time. At the end of the year, although some people hoarded a large amount, the market price rebounded to 23 or 24 yuan, but foreign transportation was still not very smooth. Generally, people hope that foreign trade can be directly operated by the state in the future, so as to maintain the prosperity of domestic production and enable the country to obtain a continuous increase in foreign exchange and strengthen the power of resistance. The second is bristles. The output is the most abundant, reaching 20,000 boxes. There are two kinds, black and white. White ones have always only been sold to Japan. In the previous year, more than 16,000 boxes could be shipped, of which white ones accounted for more than 3,000 boxes. Last year, due to the impact of the war, two new bristle bleaching factories were established in Chongqing, which can directly sell to Europe and the United States, so that Japanese merchants will not be able to make profits in the middle. However, due to the drought, the output is less, and after the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic, the average monthly export value is only one-seventh of what it was before the interruption. Therefore, the total number of exports for the whole year is only 10,000 boxes, with a total value of 10 million yuan. It is said that recently, it has been possible to use the empty trucks when requisitioned vehicles set off to transport a lot of goods through other routes. The third largest export commodity is silk. In its heyday, Sichuan silk sold 20 million dan per year. Later, due to the depression in the international market, the silk industry in Sichuan also suffered a setback. In the previous year, the silk price even fell to more than 300 yuan per bundle. Last year, the Sichuan Provincial Government expanded and reorganized the original silk company and reorganized it into Sichuan Silk Industry Company. In the spring and autumn seasons, a total of more than 5,000 dan were produced, worth more than 2 million yuan. The total sales volume of Shun, Tong, and Yu gangs was also 3,000 dan, with a total value of more than 2 million yuan. After the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic, the transportation situation was less than one-fifth of what it was before. The fourth largest export commodity is medicinal materials. In the twenty-sixth year, the total business volume of medicinal materials in Chongqing was 6 million yuan, which was 1 million yuan less than in the twenty-fifth year. Last year, from the middle of the second month of the lunar calendar to the end of the year, it was only 5 million yuan, of which imported goods accounted for more than 1 million yuan and exported goods accounted for more than 3 million yuan. After the interruption of the Yangtze River traffic, the monthly transportation and sales volume was less than one-half of what it was before the interruption. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>My Outlook on Life and the Basic Theory of Our Engagement in Vocational Education (2) Huang Yanpei</h3>
<p>The existence of countries in the world is based on various demands on life and the environment and their evolution. However, the innate condition is to serve the people. Therefore, there is a right path for political systems. Under the three essentials of government by the people, of the people, and for the people, appropriate settings are made. For those that do not match name and reality, there is only the removal of falsehood to seek truth. Perhaps abandoning everything and adopting dictatorship is because of being forced by some special environment and seeking the convenience of temporary coping. However, in political history, it can only be regarded as an abnormal organization in a certain aspect and a certain period, and placed as an exception. It is expected that when the function ends, it will naturally step onto the right track, and it can never be regarded as a permanent national law. As for social and economic systems, only under the overall interests of society and the country can the legitimate interests of individuals be safeguarded. Anything that relies on a special position to seek monopoly or over-occupation, forming injustice and unfairness, is not acceptable. After various evolutions of politics, the democratic system is proposed, and after various evolutions of the economy, socialism is proposed, which are all our beliefs. From the standpoint of the country, whether it is politics or economics, the principle is always to respect and safeguard the rights and interests of the people and concentrate and increase all forces to dedicate to the country, in order to complete its mission of creating strong and powerful individuals internally.</p>
<p>How to maximize the protection of the rights and interests of the people? The most effective method is to use an enlightened approach to make everyone understand the quality and extent of the rights and interests they should enjoy in addition to the obligations they should fulfill, and strive to obtain them, and cherish and exercise them. How to concentrate and increase all forces to dedicate to the country? The most effective method is to develop everyone's intelligence and use science to develop local and material resources. The key is to use an enlightened approach on everyone's daily work, that is, on the stereotyped actions of exchanging their mental or physical labor for the needs of life, to make everyone increase their intelligence, that is, to know and to act. And deeply understand its meaning, so that they know that the long life of mental and physical labor is not only for personal life, but to fulfill their sacred obligations directly to the group and indirectly to the country. Therefore, the power of the land and materials is increased because those engaged in development know the correctness and proficiency, and concentrated because everyone universally understands the great righteousness of pacifying and dedicating to the country, and the entire power of the country is strengthened because of this. There will be two major contributions in the meantime. Everyone's daily labor is recognized as a sacred obligation to the group, and because of the mutual induction of goodwill, everyone will also give more respect and kindness to the laborers. The wind of mutual strife and killing will gradually turn into mutual love and affection, which should not fail to be a kind of action to reduce human tragedy. Because their intelligence increases, the emphasis is on knowing and acting, so that thought and action are linked, and all their intelligence and talent are used in daily work, seeking to increase efficiency and constantly improving their work, promoting new inventions of things, which will contribute to the development of culture, so as to make up for the regrets of our country's lack of inventions and backward culture for two thousand years.</p>
<p>Based on the above understanding, we all seek the way to devote ourselves to it. There are many ways, but as we think about it, the so-called enlightened approach is to make everyone understand the obligations they should fulfill and the quality and extent of the rights and interests they should enjoy, and strive to obtain them, and cherish and exercise them, which is education. The so-called stereotyped actions of everyone exchanging their mental or physical labor for the needs of life is a profession. And using an enlightened approach to make everyone increase their intelligence, that is, to know and to act, and deeply understand its meaning, is vocational education.</p>
<p>Education, vocational education, are complex and varied. And its main contribution to the country is nothing more than this. The establishment of a country is complex and varied, and the basic conditions for cultivating strength are nothing more than this.</p>
<p>We have seen something and immediately try to do it. Even if it is just a corner, we must devote all our strength. If a small attempt is successful, it will be widely implemented, so there is no choice between ourselves and others. We know and immediately act, and do not take credit for success, to encourage others, and also to encourage ourselves. To seek the increase of work efficiency, we must gather like-minded people, the organization must be sound, the discipline must be strict, and the life must be orderly. We will not hesitate to work hard, because we are driven by our beliefs.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles of life, and the entire world view and outlook on life, our colleagues dare to generously shoulder such a great and arduous mission, believing that it is a necessary contribution to the country, and a necessary contribution to the world and all mankind in the initial stage. We have been engaged in it for many years. We respectfully express our innermost thoughts to ask for the clarification of those who know me. The purpose of vocational education was officially determined in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the year the Chinese Vocational Education Society was established.</p>
<p>1. Seeking the development of individuality.</p>
<p>2. Preparing for personal livelihood.</p>
<p>3. Preparing for personal service to society.</p>
<p>4. Preparing for the nation and the world to increase productivity.</p>
<p>December 20, 27th year of the Republic of China, Nanquan, Chongqing. (End)</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Has Shown a Rebound</h3>
<p>Selling Ex-Dividend and Buying Back on Small Dips</p>
<p>A Shift That's No Different Than Full Interest</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt Quotations on January 31st (Tuesday) were still only fluctuating by half a pound or one pound. The price of Crisp bonds continued to fall by one pound, priced at 33 pounds. The Anglo-Gold Indemnity Bonds, Anglo-French Bonds, and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds, which fell by half a pound the previous day, rebounded to their original price from the day before. The price of the former remained at 46 and a half pounds, and the latter remained at 18 and a half pounds. Transactions included two lots of Anglo-Gold Indemnity Bonds and Anglo-French Bonds, with the transaction price at 46 pounds and five shillings, an increase of five shillings. The transaction price of Anglo-French bonds was 42 pounds and fifteen shillings. On the day, the supply of physical goods in London included 5,000 pounds of Anglo-Gold Indemnity Bonds and Anglo-French Bonds, sold at 48 pounds and five shillings, an increase of one pound and fifteen shillings, and also an increase of one pound and five shillings compared to the previous week. In addition, there were 1,000 pounds of French-issued bonds with stamps, sold at 46 and a half pounds, also an increase of one pound compared to yesterday's market. There were also 2,000 pounds of German-issued bonds with stamps, sold at 44 pounds and five shillings. Railway bonds were also in high demand, including 1,000 pounds of Hubei-Guangdong Railway Bonds (non-German stamped bonds), sold at 21 pounds, down half a pound. Also, 2,000 pounds of non-winning tickets were sold at 22 pounds, the same as the market price. Also, 1,000 pounds of winning tickets were sold at 21 and a half pounds, down half a pound, and another 2,000 pounds were sold at 22 pounds, the same as the market price. 1,000 pounds of continuing issues of Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds (Anglo-French bonds), 1,000 pounds of Anglo-French winning tickets, 2,000 pounds of German stamped bonds, and 1,000 pounds of German stamped winning tickets, totaling 5,000 pounds, were all sold at 16 and a half pounds, up half a pound compared to the market and the previous day's close. 2,500 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds were sold at 18 and a half pounds, the same as the market price. In addition, there were US$20,000 of Sino-French-American 5% bonds in the city, sold at US$63.</p>
<p>London English Far East Company Stocks: The trading prices of stocks of various Far East companies listed on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, January 31st, continued to rise. The stock of the Mercantile Bank continued to rise by five shillings, with a price of nine pounds, two shillings, and six pence. The stock of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation continued to rise by one pound, with a price of eighty-three pounds and ten shillings for those registered in London and eighty-five pounds and ten shillings for those registered in Hong Kong. The unregistered stock of the Kailan Mining Administration rebounded by one shilling, with a price of sixteen shillings and six pence. The stock of the Kuraclim Plantation Company rose by one shilling and three pence, with a price of eighteen shillings and nine pence.</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities gray market situation: All bonds are calculated ex-dividend market prices. After a period of hovering, they gradually rebounded. The market situation: Initially, it was full of suspicion and wait-and-see. The appetite of those who were long had reached saturation. Most sellers sold ex-dividend to avoid the trouble of monthly dividends, and bought back on small dips. In this shift, they had already received the full interest. At this point, the downward trend came to an end. The rebound was sudden. The contrast between the forenoon and afternoon was absolute. However, people are still skeptical about whether the rebound will continue. As the market rebounded slightly, rumors of full interest spread. The sluggish and stagnant situation in the morning remained unchanged. Both buyers and sellers were very idle, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, with no business. In the afternoon, No. 41 suddenly bought in at a low price. Tong Kang issued Bing into Jia, which was also very lively. Retail investors also bought more and sold less. This rebound was not a short covering but a temporary long position. Therefore, the rebound of one yuan and several angles in the afternoon seemed too rapid. The opening of Classes A and B ex-dividend shows a decline, which is not a fact. As a result, apart from Classes A and D opening ex-dividend, the market price rebounded by one yuan and one or two jiao. The volume of transactions was more than 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>The table shows that the opening prices of Classes A and D ex-dividend are lower than the dividend price.</p>
<p>Stock market conditions: The profits and losses of various firms varied, so stock prices also rose and fell differently. The business of the China National Goods Company was unusually developed. The stock, with a face value of 20 yuan, could not be bought even at a price of 28 yuan. There were rumors of two stocks being worth one stock. Thousands of shares of China Book Company were traded at a price of 24 yuan, up a few jiao from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Finance Cash Confidence Rebounds: Returning to 2020 Yuan Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market's trading range remained narrow, but prices rebounded and strengthened. It is said that after foreign exchange received support from foreign firms, it softened, and the European situation eased after Hitler's speech, leading to a slight recovery in confidence. This rekindled interest in gold purchases among Hong Kong investors. An attempt was made to task a certain gold firm and a jewelry store to search for and purchase gold. Ultimately, with the help of jewelry stores, cash shops, and securities firms, the supply was steady, so the price increase was minimal, closing with a rebound of only three yuan. Overall confidence was slightly better than the previous day, with moderate trading. Gold jewelry remained stable, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Investors' Interest in Cash Gold Rekindled</p>
<p>From the morning, the market opened with news that foreign exchange had softened after being supported by foreign firms, and a certain gold firm was showing strong interest in purchasing on behalf of Hong Kong investors. As a result, the opening price was raised to 2020 yuan per tael (ten liang). The gold firm then purchased 50 taels each from a securities firm and a cash shop, followed by 100 taels from a jewelry store, all at the same price. Shortly after, a jewelry store also purchased 50 taels from a cash shop on behalf of Hong Kong investors, again at the same price. Subsequently, it purchased another 50 taels from a fellow jewelry store for 21 yuan. The gold firm then purchased 30 taels from a jewelry store for 22 yuan. The gold firm again purchased 50 taels from a jewelry store at a similar price. After selling, the jewelry store immediately repurchased at the original price, acquiring 50 taels from a cash shop. Later, a money exchange also sold 50 taels to a jewelry store at the same price. Another money exchange purchased 50 taels from a jewelry store, still at 22 yuan. By then, it was already 11:00 AM. After this, both supply and demand became scarce, and the price remained stable. No transactions occurred until noon, so the closing price at noon remained at 22 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the lack of activity in the foreign exchange market, trading became even more sparse. Around 3:00 PM, only 50 taels were traded between money exchanges, still at 22 yuan. After that, the market became even quieter, so the closing price in the evening was no different from the noon price. As a result, the price increased by three yuan compared to the previous day. The cash shop's listed selling price for standard gold was 2030 yuan, and the buying price was 2015 yuan. The spot gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no transactions occurred.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores remained unchanged due to the stability of cash gold. Large stores like Lao Qingyun continued to list the original price of 205 yuan per liang, while newer stores listed 203 yuan for selling and 197 yuan for buying.</p>
<p>Pound Sterling Strong, Pure Gold Continues to Fall</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 31st stated that the price of British pure gold continued to fall because the pound sterling had strengthened since Hitler's speech. The price fell by another 1.5 pence per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6d. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash also decreased to 1212.3 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also decreased by 3%, amounting to 2.394 yuan. The price of Shanghai standard gold also decreased by one yuan, amounting to 1207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Money Exchanges' Clearing Volume in the Past Two Weeks</h3>
<p>—Around 12 Million Yuan—</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai money exchanges started including clearing transfers in the reserve pool exchange on January 16th of this year, it was initially considered a trial run and not disclosed. Even after this newspaper published the news, outsiders still mistakenly believed it was a bank clearing transfer exchange, even involving banks on the Bund, demonstrating the extent of the misunderstanding. Now, the clearing volume for the past two weeks since the money exchanges started handling clearing transfers themselves is disclosed below. However, this newspaper did not send anyone to the money exchanges' association to investigate these figures. The newspaper has its own way of gathering news. This is for the information of all parties. (Unit: Yuan) (0)</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Increase Settlements, Foreign Exchange Returns to Tightening</h3>
<p>Although the foreign exchange market received a continuous flow of telegraphic transfers from abroad yesterday, it tightened again due to the approaching Lunar New Year and increased settlements by foreign firms. Furthermore, the European situation remained internally tense despite external relaxation, and banks were not supplying smoothly. However, there were no special changes mid-session, and trading remained active. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate tightened slightly because money exchanges were not actively selling, and banks were absorbing the currency better.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the spread between near-term and forward London large bills continued to narrow, New York spot rates remained flat, London gold narrowed by 1.5 pence, the pound-to-dollar exchange rate increased by 1.3 cents, and the exchange rates against France and Shanghai remained unchanged. The dollar-to-pound exchange rate decreased by 4375, the dollar-to-franc exchange rate decreased by 125, and the dollar-to-Shanghai exchange rate decreased slightly by 0.02. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening, banks' selling price for the pound was 8 328125 pence, and the selling price for the dollar was 16.25 yuan, shrinking by 0.015625 for the pound and tightening by 0.03125 for the dollar compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, foreign firms first aggressively bought from American banks and Dutch banks at only 8 328125 pence for the pound, leading to a tightening of the situation. The pound tightened to 8 3125 pence, and the dollar softened to 16.1875 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was announced to be reduced by 25. Subsequently, telegraphic transfers poured in, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation sold pounds to Dutch banks at 8 34375 pence and American banks sold dollars to the Hua Bi Bank at 16.28125 yuan, resulting in a slight rebound in the process. Later, foreign firms returned to purchase dollars from American banks at only 16.21875 yuan, and Italian, Dutch, and Anda banks bought Hong Kong dollars from money exchanges, narrowing from 56.125 yuan to 56 yuan, ultimately leading to a tightening of the situation. The closing selling price for banks at noon was 8 328125 pence for the pound and 16.21875 yuan for the dollar, resulting in a tightening of 0.015625 for the pound and a decrease of 0.0625 for the dollar compared to the previous closing price. The Hong Kong dollar softened by 0.125. In the afternoon, the market was quiet on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Demand for Foreign Currencies</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by 1.5 pence, and the British-American exchange rate decreased by 4375. Foreign exchange trading remained active, but bank supply was not smooth, indicating a weakening trend. The market was quiet on Wednesday afternoon. Cash gold supply and demand were balanced, and large transactions became rare. The afternoon market was even more depressed, showing a fluctuating trend. Foreign currencies were abundant and there was some hoarding. The foreign exchange market closed slightly weaker, and market prices became more firm. Most currencies tended to rise again. Demand for American dollar drafts increased, and French franc drafts were also strong, showing a firm trend. Trading at the exchange was still active. Yongtai sold and Hengmao bought 1000 yuan in American dollar drafts. Also, Huetong bought 10 British pounds from Letai. Letai sold and Santai bought 2000 yuan in American dollar drafts.

<p>British and Indian Silver Prices Weak</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 31st stated that there was little market change due to limited buying and selling by speculators, and the market remained steady after closing. The spread between near-term and forward large silver bars continued to narrow by 0.0625. A New York silver dispatch stated that American silver prices remained unchanged. A Bombay silver dispatch stated that the Indian silver market was slightly weak, with both spot and near-term prices decreasing by 3 annas and forward prices decreasing by 4 annas.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets, both in Japan and America, experienced sudden and rapid increases. Yokohama spot prices opened at 915 yuan in the morning and closed at 920 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous day. Forward prices opened at 890 yuan in the morning and closed at 897 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 24 yuan. New York 83-day silk was sold at $1.99, up $0.05; 75-day silk opened at $1.93, up $0.03; Shanghai silk was at $1.89, up $0.05; Guangdong silk was up $0.01. Exchange prices for near-term increased by $0.04 and for forward increased by $0.045. Due to the feverish rise in foreign silk markets, the situation in Shanghai was even tighter. The price difference between foreign firms and domestic users reached 100 yuan. User White Factory original paper was sold at 1390 yuan, and Peace grade was sold at 1440 yuan. Wuxi small trucks have also been sold at 1350 yuan. Market sentiment is extremely enthusiastic, but although silk prices are rising daily, silk trading is not as active as it was the week before. In the foreign firm silk market, only India saw slightly more sales. Zhejiang reeled silk was traded at 760 yuan in the afternoon, up 30 to 40 yuan. According to January figures, the market price of Shanghai factory silk has increased by 140 yuan (at the beginning of January, the price of White Factory B grade was 1260 yuan, and at the end of January it had risen to over 1400 yuan). Foreign firm silk trading has been quiet for a long time, with only domestic user seeing strong sales. This is not a good outlet for factory silk.</p>
<p>516 pieces of silk were shipped to Europe in one day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yunnan and Guangdong Investors Active Again, Cotton Yarn Decline Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Double Horse Warehouse Orders Still Being Pulled</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Market Eases in February, No Transactions Yet</p>
<p>After several days of continuous decline in the yarn market, the situation stabilized slightly yesterday. At the same time, the Yunnan and Chaoshan investors showed healthier appetite, buying nearly 300 bales of coarse and fine yarn. Otherwise, there was no hope of improvement. However, some argue that in recent days, prices have fallen by 16 yuan from the peak, and although the Shenxin factories have released a large number of bonds, they are mostly futures and cannot be used as warehouse orders for the time being. Most of them are in the hands of financial institutions and there is no intention to release them currently. Therefore, no one is willing to cut their losses and are holding firm, which has slightly stabilized the weak market. Selling prices are uneven.</p>
<p>Checking the current yarn market situation, the market opened weakly in the morning due to sluggish actual sales and the approach of the Lunar New Year. Generally, there was a lack of desire to hold through the New Year, leading to the release of goods and a depressing market. Opening prices fell by 0.5 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 391.5 yuan. Hong Kong investors only bought 10 bales. After that, sales were sluggish and gradually decreased. Double Horse almost broke through the 390 yuan barrier. Subsequently, after someone pulled 200 bales of Double Horse yarn with warehouse orders, the closing price rebounded slightly. The current price of Double Horse yarn is still 392 yuan, with no change from the previous day. A total of 924 bales were traded in the morning, with inter-dealer trading accounting for two-thirds. As a result, the market prices for 20-count Double Horse were similar to the previous day, Tiannv fell by 0.5 yuan, Special Jincheng rose by 1 yuan, and Double Globe rose by 0.15 yuan. However, 18-count Tiannv fell by 1.5 yuan. The factory did not take any action. Yesterday, 135 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 590 pieces to Shantou, and 20 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by each investor group are listed below.</p>
<p>After the short-selling squeeze in the Japanese yarn market, the market eased substantially and prices continued to decline. At the same time, actual demand was extremely weak. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 324-5 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 320 yuan. There have been no transactions for February yarn.</p>
<h3>Cotton Transactions Await Bull Market</h3>
<p>Overseas Market Prices All Rise</p>
<p>The price of foreign cotton, and American cotton prices in particular, currently depend entirely on government cotton legislation and the sale of loan cotton. However, Congress is constantly wavering on this cotton issue, which is attracting worldwide attention, making it difficult to predict. This issue is indeed a serious global problem. Therefore, all operators are uneasy and waiting for developments in Washington. Yesterday, New York rose by 4 points. India, due to the sharp rise in New York forward prices the day before, rose by 2 rupees along with forecasts yesterday. Egypt is still closed. Exchange rates yesterday did not fluctuate much. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rising by 0.6 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rising by 0.09 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rising by 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the imminent Lunar New Year, foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has become quiet. Moreover, yarn prices have not improved this week, so there may be no large-scale transactions this year. However, it is generally believed that yarn prices will improve next year when the bull market arrives, and foreign cotton trading will also have to wait until next year. Yesterday, there were still small transactions with Japanese factories. The transaction amounts and prices for yesterday are listed below.</p>
<p>Local cotton business remains stagnant, with no activity from any party, almost at a standstill. This is due to the approaching end-of-year accounting period, as cotton merchants prepare to close for the New Year. Trading is unlikely to develop further. In addition, prices have already risen to the point where there is no room for further increases. The factory, due to the recent sluggish yarn market and narrowing profit margins, has limited purchasing power. However, purchases of foreign cotton are still in full swing. The supply from Northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly scarce. 846 bales of Tong cotton arrived, 54 pieces came from Youpu, 220 pieces came from Baimao, and 190 pieces came from Beisha. For exports, 170 pieces were shipped to Shantou, 90 pieces to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces to Beihai. The current cotton selling prices and transaction amounts are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Grains Lower-Grade Flour Shipments to the North Show Activity, Wheat Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>The flour market remained stable yesterday, with continuous small transactions from various investors. Southern investors added 5,000 to 6,000 bags of No. 2 flour, etc., while shipments to the North increased, with nearly 20,000 bags traded. "Tuzhong" and "Chechuan" brand No. 2 flour accounted for half of the transactions, with the remainder being No. 4 and No. 5 flour. The prices were 4.8 yuan for "Chechuan," 3.55 yuan for "Hong Liuhai," and 3.3 yuan for "White Bag." The market situation is unlikely to change significantly this year. Yesterday, 3,000 bags were shipped to Weihaiwei, 2,000 bags to Yantai, and 8,500 bags to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The supply of wheat remained limited yesterday, and costs were not particularly high. Factories, facing a shortage of imported wheat and persistent demand for domestic wheat, were unwilling to accept inflated prices, resulting in a cautious market. As a result, only one type of Northern Jiangsu high-gluten wheat was traded, with Fuxin and Fufeng factories each purchasing 1,000 bags at the original price of 6.55 yuan.</p>
<p>High-Quality Early Rice Market Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the number of early rice arriving by military transport was small, with only 2,150 bags coming from Pei County. However, local retailers' appetites were strong, with shops, factories, and foreign buyers absorbing much of the supply early. As a result, over 1,000 bags were sold in the morning, followed by another 2,000 bags in the afternoon. The high-quality early rice, priced at 10.023 yuan, was particularly active. There were few transactions for higher grades. Nanjing early rice rose to 10.08 yuan. Higher grades of Wuhu early rice were not sold, while mid-grade rice rose by 0.1 yuan in the market.</p>
<p>Polished Rice Shows Revival, Shanghai Warehouses Full, Leading to Scarcer Supply</p>
<p>After a continuous decline, the domestic rice market rebounded yesterday, driven by full warehouses in Shanghai, which led to a decrease in supply from the interior. Only No. 3 rice arrived from Hexia, and only 1,000 to 2,000 bags of "Cheliun Baozi" rice arrived, leading to a revival in sentiment. The local market was quite active. However, because warehouses were full, hoarders were reluctant to buy, preventing a full recovery in the market. As a result, the price of thick japonica rice rose by 0.1 yuan after falling below market value, and the price of "Gaoke" rice rose only by a few cents. Due to the shortage of Hexia rice, thin indica rice rose by 0.1 yuan, while original-packaged rice remained largely unchanged. Consequently, the prices of "Duyang Jian" and "Bujian Jian" rice only improved slightly by a few cents. High-quality "Bian Yuan" rice was unchanged, while mid-grade rice showed a slight improvement of 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Soybeans Exported: Over 500 Tons</h3>
<p>Xiamen and Other Locations Continue to Purchase</p>
<p>The price of soybeans is usually determined by the price of train soybeans. However, since the start of the war, train soybeans have not been available. As a result, Chongming sand soybeans, which have a daily market, have become the standard for both buyers and sellers. Recently, the supply of this soybean has decreased due to environmental factors. The market has become more lively, leading to rising prices. However, yesterday's market saw a slight decline in demand. High-quality sand soybeans were priced at 7.7 yuan, while mid-quality soybeans ranged from 7.64 to 7.645 yuan. Xiamen buyers purchased over 600 bags from this area. Other transactions included 50 bags of Pinghu mid-grain "Du" soybeans, priced at 9 yuan, and 50 bags of Dalian soybeans, priced at 7.95 yuan. Shipments for export yesterday included 250 bags of soybeans to Dumen, 50 bags to Hong Kong, 421 tons to Bombay, and 101 tons to Colombo. In addition, 500 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Xiamen, 400 pieces to Shantou, and 1,640 cans of crude oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Domestic Sugar Market Unusually Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of Dutch sugar remained weak. The exchange set the price of No. 2 Dutch coarse white sugar for spot goods in foreign warehouses at the original price of 24 yuan, but there were few buyers. Re-exported goods were 0.2 yuan lower, at 15.6 yuan. The price of Taikoo "Che Bai" B grade sugar in Western warehouses fell to 23.6 yuan, and the price in Eastern warehouses fell to 23.5 yuan. Sellers were even more accommodating, fearing further softening in the market. On the other hand, the domestic sugar market trended differently, as production in various producing areas this year has decreased. For example, in Zhangzhou, where hundreds of loads were exported daily in winter, only dozens of loads are exported daily now. Furthermore, because domestic white sugar sells well, some are converting sugar production to white sugar, so green sugar is becoming scarcer. In Shantou, farmers are no longer rushing to Shantou to sell their sugar. If they are purchased directly in the countryside, prices are difficult to lower. Northern investors are stationed in Shantou to purchase sugar, so green, red, and white sugar are consistently strong. In Quanzhou, foreign investors have been buying, so land prices have been rising frequently. High-quality white sugar is being quoted at 26-27 yuan, and the prices of green and red sugar are also soaring. Yesterday, only seventy bags of Xinghua "Jue Bai" sugar were offered, priced at 18 yuan. Chao sugar was slightly re-opened, with no change. Over 100 bags of Huanggang green sugar were priced at 13.8 yuan. On the 31st, 1,100 bags of sugar were shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Items Star Anise Plummets by Four Yuan</p>
<p>Because it is expected that star anise will be available in mid-March and due to the end-of-year accounting, some sellers who do not want to hold the product for long are willing to sell at a loss. Yesterday, the market offered a price of 24 yuan, offering over 20 bags. However, even at this price, although not the bottom, it is unlikely to fall further as the arrival of new stock is not significant.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Goods: Both Peaches and Lotus Seeds See Price Increases</p>
<p>Hand-picked peaches from within the pass have recently seen increased prices, reaching as high as 44 yuan, with sellers asking 46 yuan. The prices of other varieties ranged from 40 yuan to 26-27 yuan. Mingguang Lake lotus seeds have recently arrived, and their quality is good, so the selling price has been raised to 40 yuan, an increase of 5-6 yuan. Hunan lotus seeds remain stable with no changes. Local lotus seeds are priced at 125 yuan, and other varieties are priced at 120 yuan. Top-grade white lotus seeds are being quoted at 100 yuan, and stock is scarce.</p>
<p>Coal and Charcoal Coking Coal Sales Plunge</p>
<p>Down By As Much As Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, because the foundries in Shanghai have mostly stopped working due to the approaching end of the year, coking coal sales have been severely affected. Inventory has piled up, and the market is depressed. Recently, the black market price was only 170 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan. Demand remains weak, and the trend seems likely to continue. It is said that most outside hoarders currently holding inventory have suffered significant losses, which was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Approaching End-of-Year Accounting, Ordering Gradually Cools</h3>
<p>Factory Goods More Expensive in the Future</p>
<p>Domestic cotton cloth from Zhejiang and Fujian is currently in low demand, as various investor groups need to reconcile their accounts due to the approaching end-of-year accounting period. The ordered goods are still being shipped as planned, but new orders have become intermittent. The market is average, and the momentum remains tight. Factory prices for future deliveries are more expensive than current prices. Local dealers are also unwilling to sell at a loss. Demand from Southwest, Sichuan, and Yunnan investors remains strong. Yunnan investors have ordered nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, bleached twill, lining, cotton, colored twill, and printed fabrics. Sichuan investors have also ordered 1,000+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, cotton, printed fabrics, and satin. Wen and Yong investors from Zhejiang have ordered over 200 bales of Yihe coarse cloth for next month's delivery at 0.1 yuan above the market price. New orders are rare, and only orders for colored cloth and colored twill are still being processed. Hong Kong investors have ordered 30-40 pieces of dyed grey fabric and fine twill. Local wholesalers have purchased 56 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill for bleaching and dyeing.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of fine cloth and fine twill from Dong Cloth continued to decline. This is because the actual sales to the customer are gradually decreasing as the close of the business year draws near, resulting in increasingly weak spot prices. In the morning, the price of Longtou fine cloth fell to eleven yuan and eight jiao, then a Shanghai color cloth firm rose to absorb the stock with a single order for 200+ pieces. Other fine twill, fine cloth, and other factories searched for around 1000 pieces of dyed blank cloth. In the afternoon, the market turned bullish and the price rebounded slightly, resulting in a fall of one jiao per bolt of fine cloth/ fine twill compared to the previous day. However, the futures market remained stable and did not ease. The ratio between the market list and the spot list was a difference of 4-5 jiao per piece. Therefore, the offer of goods from various firms was said to be uninteresting.</p>
<p>Inspection of Piece Goods exports yesterday showed 20 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 10 pieces to Shantou, 2 pieces to Hong Kong, 300 pieces to Yantai, and 70 pieces to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Seafood New Bombay Shrimp Tails Arrive</p>
<p>Dried Shrimp and Glass Fish Arrivals Also Lacking</p>
<p>New Bombay shrimp tails have recently started arriving, but the quantity is small. Yesterday, a firm offered high-grade shrimp tails for 106 yuan and secondary-grade shrimp tails for 87 yuan. Quality quite dry.</p>
<p>Arrivals of Yantai dried shrimp have been lacking for a long time. Sales have been continuous on a small scale. Currently, ordinary goods are sold for 60 yuan, so the trend is stable.</p>
<p>Zhejiang glass fish from Zhoushan is even more scarce. Ningbo goods require 34 yuan. The market will need to increase by 1-2 yuan later.</p>
<p>Hardware American Narrow Strip Steel Widely Sold</p>
<p>American narrow strip steel is being heavily purchased by Tianjin investors. Local canneries are also showing good appetite. As a result, 400-500 boxes are being offered daily. The market price for assorted colors is 43-44 yuan per box. The market price for single sizes is 42 yuan for 2-inch to 4-inch, and 45-48 yuan for 5-inch to 8-inch. Yesterday, over 1,000 boxes of new goods arrived at the Kung Wo Cheung, Kee Chong warehouse, etc. It is said that factories have already disposed of half of them. Because overseas prices have been rising sharply in recent days, local confidence is strong, and no one is willing to sell much. The market is not expected to ease easily in the near future. The previous day, 460 pieces of lead and 800 pieces of nails were shipped to Ningbo.</p>

<h3>Japanese Airplane Lands in Jiading, Burned by Guerrilla Unit, Forced Landing Due to Mechanical Failure, Pilot Visited the Next Morning and Only Remained the Shell</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin paper said that yesterday (31st) afternoon, news was revealed in Shanghai, a Japanese Airlines biplane forced landed near Jiading on Monday (30th). Guerrilla fighters active in that area searched the plane thoroughly and burned it. The three Japanese crew members were all safe. It was found that the plane was a four-seat commercial transport plane, which took off from Nanjing at 2:30 PM on that day. Ten minutes later, the engine malfunctioned and the plane was forced to land in a rice field 10 kilometers southeast of Jiading. The three Japanese crew members left the plane and went to the nearby Japanese garrison for help. They then met some Japanese soldiers, intending to return to the landing site, but because it was already dark, they did not go. Yesterday morning, they went to the landing site again and found that the plane had been searched and burned.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Protection of Domestic Goods, Strict Prevention of Japanese Goods Posing as Domestic</h3>
<p>Order number Chuan Gong Zi 14885 from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, ordering the Construction Departments of the provincial governments and the consulates in Nanyang, etc. states that, "The rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods, promulgated by the Ministry, were revised and announced in September of the 27th year. Currently, in extraordinary times, the government should broadly provide certificates for, and protect, domestic goods manufactured by domestic factories. At the same time, the government should strictly prevent Japanese goods from posing as domestic goods in order to maintain the interests of legitimate manufacturers. To ensure that these measures are widely known, in addition to separate orders, a complete set of rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods is enclosed for local Chinese newspapers to publish, in order to broadly disseminate this information. This order is issued.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Their Products, Exempt from Transit Tax, From Number 45 to Number 54</h3>

<h3>City Residents Form Fundraising Committee: Standing Committee Meeting Resolves Several Important Cases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee recently held its sixth standing committee meeting to discuss matters, including a proposal to organize a "One-Day Citizen Relief Movement." It was resolved to send personnel to liaise with the Association. Committee member Tao Leqin suggested forming a student team with sub-teams, each with a captain and director, and proposed inviting Mr. Fang Kangnian to take charge. It was resolved to establish Teams 124 and immediately invite Mr. Fang Kangnian to serve as the team leader, promoting it among students.

<h3>The Vanguard Army Engages in Fierce Battle at Changshu; Company Commander Yu Sacrifices Himself for the Nation; Struggle for the Shizhuang Bridge in Wuxi; Japanese Casualties Exceed a Dozen, Eventually Retreating</h3>
<p>According to people from Changshu, the 5th Company of the Independent Detachment of the 4th Regiment of Commander Zhong Bingyan's unit of the Second Vanguard Army in Jiangnan, Third War Zone, was recently transferred to Xiyang near Fushan in Changshu. At dawn at the end of last month, they encountered over 200 Japanese soldiers coming from Changshu City. Company Commander Yu Shitang bravely led the charge and was unfortunately killed after being struck by several bullets, sacrificing himself for the country. Six soldiers also died in action at the same time, and four were seriously wounded. The situation was critical at the time. Fortunately, after hearing the news, the regimental headquarters, led by Commander Zhong, surrounded the enemy in several directions, and after four hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese were defeated. After the battle, it was found that four Japanese soldiers had died, and a local civilian, Xu Caidong, was also unfortunately killed by a stray bullet. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 25th, the unit under Deputy Commander Gao Zugao engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese at Shizhuang in Wuxi. The two sides fought across the Xicheng Canal. The Japanese used small mortars and launched grenade assaults. During the struggle for the Shizhuang Bridge, Gao Ahong, the squad leader of the special task force under Gao's unit, led a charge but was unfortunately killed by mortar fire, and three soldiers also died, with five wounded. The Japanese side suffered more than a dozen casualties and retreated towards Tangtouqiao in Jiangyin in the evening after skirmishing until nightfall.</p>
<h3>Customs Increase, Five Branch Offices Added, Some New Japanese Customs Officers</h3>
<p>Regarding the forced increase in Japanese customs officers at the Jianghai Customs and the subsequent establishment of customs branch offices, this reporter has learned that the new customs branch offices established by the Jianghai Customs were established today. A total of five branch offices have been added: North Railway Station, Jessfield Road near Caojiadu, Hongqiao Road in Xujiahui, and the other two are roughly in the Hongkou area, one being a key location for goods transported by road to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, and the other being the Suzhou River. The customs offices at these newly established branch offices are now mainly staffed by Western customs officers, together with Chinese customs officers, and newly added lower-ranking Japanese customs officers. According to sources, the establishment of these customs branch offices was indeed triggered by the addition of lower-ranking Japanese customs officers, which caused a public outcry. However, the establishment of customs branch offices is also sufficient to prevent and investigate the smuggling of goods into the interior for dumping. However, the Japanese demand for more senior customs officers was repeatedly rejected by Tax Commissioner Rocher due to customs regulations. However, the Japanese side continued to demand, and Rocher, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, stated that he had no authority to handle it and transferred it to the Inspector General of Customs for processing.</p>
<h3>Escorted by British Warships, Yongzhen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Heda and Hafa Delay Departure Due to Insufficient Coal, Seized Legal Tender Returned After Negotiation</h3>
<p>The three foreign freighters seized by Japanese warships and customs patrol boats at Yanghekou on the 27th of last month and forced to sail to Qingdao have all been released successively after negotiations by the British and Norwegian consuls. The Yongzhen arrived in Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning. The Heda and Hafa delayed their departure due to insufficient coal and telegraphed to delay until last night or this morning to leave Qingdao. The legal tender seized by the Japanese side has also been returned after negotiation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>British Warship Escorts Yongzhen to Port</p>
<p>The British freighter Yongzhen of the Shanghai Yongli Shipping Company, along with the Heda and Hafa, was seized by Japanese warships and Qingdao customs patrol boats at Yanghekou on the 27th of last month and forced to sail to Qingdao. Subsequently, the British Consul-General lodged a protest and sent the British warship HMS Hynam to Qingdao for protection. The Japanese side released the ship first on the morning of the 30th. Then, at around 9:00, escorted by a British warship, it sailed directly back to Shanghai and arrived at Pudong Longmao Warehouse at 10:00 yesterday morning. According to crew members of the freighter, the forced seizure of the Yongzhen and other three freighters and sailing to Qingdao had no legal basis. Fortunately, the British Consulate lodged a reasonable protest, and the British warship was dispatched for protection. Therefore, although the Yongzhen was searched in Qingdao, the silver and banknotes it carried were not detained.</p>
<p>Heda and Hafa Delay Sailing to Shanghai</p>
<p>A reporter from the Modern News Agency learned from the Subei Joint Transportation Company yesterday that according to a telegram received by the Norwegian Consulate, the Heda and Hafa were released at 11:00 the day before yesterday after negotiations by the Norwegian Consul in Qingdao. They originally planned to sail to Shanghai immediately, but the coal carried in the ships had been used up and could not be started. The Norwegian Consulate notified the Mitsui Coal Yard in Qingdao to add coal, but the docking was slightly hindered due to wind in Qingdao port, resulting in insufficient coal loading and a delay until last night or this morning to set sail for Shanghai, arriving in port the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Seized Legal Tender Returned After Negotiation</p>
<p>After the Heda and Hafa arrived in Qingdao, they were illegally searched by the Japanese side, and all the silver and legal tender carried by the two ships from Fuyu to Shanghai were seized, intending to confiscate them. According to a telegram from the Qingdao Consulate, regarding the seized silver and banknotes, the Norwegian Consulate continued to negotiate, and all legal tender has been returned in full. However, regarding the confiscated silver, the Japanese side claimed that it would only be returned after verification.</p>
<p>HMS Poulo Also Escorted to Shanghai</p>
<p>The British freighter HMS Poulo, which was detained by the Japanese side in Qingdao the other day, was escorted to Shanghai yesterday by a British warship. The British naval authorities have protested to the Japanese side and stated the reason for the detention of the British ship. The Japanese side has agreed to submit a reply today. According to the captain of the HMS Poulo, the ship was loading goods near Haizhou together with two Japanese ships, when a Chinese customs patrol boat and two Japanese destroyers sailed over and ordered it to sail to Qingdao. It was released only one day later. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it immediately notified the British Navy, and the British warship HMS Birmingham, which was stationed in Weihaiwei, was ordered to sail to Qingdao and escort the HMS Poulo to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route Still a Temporary Measure, Formal Sailing Only Permitted After Inspection and Certification, Tangsai and Meida to Sail to Shanghai from Ningbo Today; Unification of Freight Rates Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Since the Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group promulgated revised measures for navigation in eastern Zhejiang, no longer prohibiting direct routes between Shanghai and Ningbo, the Moufu, Xin'anna, Liangzhou, Deping and other ships have all implemented direct sailing to Ningbo. However, this direct route is temporary. Formal long-term sailing is only permitted after the completion of measurement and registration procedures. The Sino-Italian Company stated that it has not yet made a formal decision on the unification of cargo freight rates. The Tangsai and Meida, vessels on the Ningbo fixed route, have telegraphed that they are scheduled to sail directly to Shanghai today, and will also implement direct routes between Shanghai and Ningbo. Details are as follows by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>Direct Route Still a Temporary Adjustment</p>
<p>In the past, the military authorities in Zhejiang Province strengthened national defense forces, so they directly blocked the Yong River, prohibiting navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo. After requests from various parties, they only permitted routes via Wenzhou and Taizhou, and continued to prohibit direct routes. It was only recently that revised measures for navigation in eastern Zhejiang were promulgated, allowing Shanghai and Ningbo to resume direct routes. Therefore, the Moufu, Xin'anna, Liangzhou, Deping and other ships have all implemented direct sailing to Ningbo. However, according to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Modern News Agency from the shipping industry yesterday, although direct routes are now permitted for each ship, it is still temporary. This is because the Ningbo authorities recognized that there was a large backlog of local products, and with the approach of the end of the year, they adopted a flexible approach to regulate the rural economy. However, each ship is limited to two or three trips. At the same time, during the direct route period, they will carry out measurement procedures and apply for a certificate with a limit of more than one year of sailing. If they get approval, they can sail permanently, otherwise they will still be prohibited from sailing.</p>
<p>Tangsai and Meida Sail to Shanghai from Ningbo</p>
<p>The Tangsai, of the American-owned Huamei Company, and the Meida, of the Portuguese-owned Meili Company, originally sailed on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, on December 26th of last year, they were ordered to stop sailing to Shanghai, so they specialized in the Ningbo-Taizhou route. The Tangsai sailed to Fujian some days ago to load goods once, and returned to Ningbo yesterday morning. The Meili Company received a telegram from the Ningbo branch yesterday reporting that the Meida is scheduled to sail directly back to Shanghai from Ningbo today (2nd), and asked the Shanghai company to prepare goods for transportation to Ningbo. Judging from the meaning of the telegram, it should be that the Ningbo side has agreed to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The Tangsai is also scheduled to sail to Shanghai from Ningbo today, and will probably also join the direct Shanghai-Ningbo route, and that after the Moufu opened to Ningbo, it returned to Shanghai yesterday and will arrive in port this morning.</p>
<p>Freight Rate Issue Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping freight rates were re-negotiated by the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Sino-Italian companies on May 1st of last year, and were appropriately increased compared to before the war. Later, the Shanghai-Ningbo route was prohibited, and the Sino-Italian ships stopped sailing in compliance with the order. As for other shipping companies, there may have been special circumstances, and they were still able to sail. As a result, the increased freight rates were excessively high compared to the publicly determined prices last year. After the Ender and Deping were approved to sail from Wenzhou to Ningbo, in order to reduce the burden on passengers, they still charged the previously determined freight rates, and did not arbitrarily lower them. Yesterday (i.e., the 31st), representatives of the three companies gathered to discuss unifying freight rates, but it was only an exchange of views and not a formal meeting, so there was no decision.</p>
<p>Merchants Eagerly Hope to Reduce Shipping Costs</p>
<p>The Ningbo merchants in Shanghai believe that with the recent restoration of direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes, shipping freight rates should be appropriately reduced in accordance with the wishes of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to reduce the burden on merchants and facilitate the transportation and sale of local products. It is heard that they will jointly submit a request to the Ningbo Association and the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, who will inform the three companies for review. According to a leader in the customs declaration industry who spoke to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, before the war, Shanghai-Ningbo shipping freight rates were only 7.6 yuan per ton for general cargo, 0.42 yuan per load for miscellaneous grains, 1 yuan per load for oil, 0.46 yuan per load for sugar, 0.1 yuan per bag for flour, and 3.11 yuan per piece for golden silk grass. However, after the war, the various shipping companies raised prices one after another without any restrictions. After opposition from various parties, the new tariff of the three companies was set on May 1st of last year, but it was still three times higher than before the war. At present, the various companies have a proposal to maintain the previously set freight rate list. The customs declaration industry believes that it is still too expensive, so they hope that it can be appropriately reduced.</p>
<h3>Large Export of Inland Rice Grains Will Affect Food Supply in Shanghai; Reduced Arrivals Cause Continued Rise in Rice Prices; Central Government Implements Control of Reserve Military Grain</h3>
<p>The Japanese side is seizing rice grains in large quantities in the occupied inland areas and shipping them for export. At the same time, the North and South Ocean gangs are also directly purchasing rice grains from various producing areas along the Yangtze River for transshipment, resulting in a sharp decrease in inland reserves. It is expected that there will be a food panic in April and May of this year when the harvest is not in. For the sake of long-term resistance against Japan, the central government has taken control of grain producing areas in various provinces, and local government organs have been placed in charge. Shanghai rice prices continue to increase. Details are as follows by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>Large Exports Reduce Reserves</p>
<p>The Japanese side is using its special power in the inland areas to seize rice grains at low prices in the rice-producing areas of various counties in Jiangnan and ship them for export. If the people slightly disobey, they will be detained and killed. Therefore, they dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and are left at the mercy of traitors. Also, since the Shanghai authorities restricted the transshipment of rice grains, the various gangs have been directly purchasing from various producing areas along the Yangtze River, such as Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Changyinsha, Hupu, and Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Songjiang along the inner Yangtze River line. The number of those directly transshipping each month is very large. At present, inland reserves have decreased. Even farmers who plant more fields can only store one or two dozen loads of rice grains after the autumn harvest, which is only a few percent. Under this situation, it is expected that there will be an extreme panic of rice grains in April and May of this year.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>The arrival of inland rice in Shanghai recently has decreased by 30-40% compared to October and November of last year. The daily arrival is currently 6,000-7,000 bags, while the Shanghai consumption for civilian food supply is more than 11,000 bags per day, with a daily deficit of 3,000-4,000 bags. Based on the current stock of 700,000 bags of rice in Shanghai, it can only maintain the people's food supply for four or five months. Therefore, the current market rice price continues to rise due to increased sales, numerous inland taxes, and rainy weather, among other reasons. With the Lunar New Year approaching, rice prices are unlikely to fall.</p>
<p>Grain Reserves Under Provincial Control</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek decided to store ten years of military and civilian grain to prepare for a long-term resistance against Japan, the provincial governments have followed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's instructions to implement measures to control the production and sales of grain. According to sources from the Modern News Agency, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have already started to conduct a thorough investigation of the amount of grain produced in various provinces, counties, and districts, and reward farmers for production. All newly harvested rice grains this year will be purchased and stored by the government at an assessed price, and absolutely prohibited from being transported to the Yangtze River area.</p>
<h3>Report of Reorganization of Tianjin Bank of Communications Not True, Tianjin Branch Operating as Usual, No Other Changes</h3>
<p>The report that the Tianjin Bank of Communications had been reorganized and managed by the "United Reserve Bank" after the puppet government repeatedly lowered the value of legal tender has been denied by the bank's authorities and branch personnel. The Tianjin branch is still operating as usual and there have been no other changes.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economy Negotiates Regulations; Japanese Forcefully Control Certain Areas; Zhejiang Provincial Government Recognizes Shanghai as Not a Controlled Area; Wenzhou and Ningbo Customs Telegraph Inspector-General for Instructions</h3>
<p>After various provincial governments and customs authorities were ordered to investigate and prohibit the transportation of 54 types of goods to Japan, its colonies or mandated territories, and areas forcefully controlled by the Japanese, the Ministry of Economy is currently conducting a detailed investigation and consulting with relevant agencies to determine the "prohibited transportation areas forcefully controlled by the Japanese." Local customs authorities generally prohibit the transportation of the above-mentioned goods to Shanghai, believing that since Shanghai fell, everything has been under Japanese control. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that, although the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that Shanghai has not been forcefully controlled by the Japanese and has not been designated by the Ministry of Economy as a prohibited transportation area, all local goods such as paper are allowed to be transported and sold according to the original plan. However, the tax commissioners of the Zhejiang Ningbo and Wenzhou customs have telegraphed the Inspector-General of Customs for instructions and will proceed with handling the matter after an explanation.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, saying, "Regarding the case of the prohibited transportation of materials to the enemy, the Zhejiang Customs issued an announcement on the last day of January, and designated cotton, tea, paper, eggs, and other items as major export products of eastern Zhejiang. Once these items are prohibited from transportation, millions of people will be cut off from their livelihood. We have already sent a letter to the Zhejiang Customs to postpone implementation, and also telegraphed your ministry for instructions in the You month, and also presented a request through the First Inspection Team of Military Discipline in the War Zone of the Military Affairs Commission, and telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission to instruct the customs to allow the shipment of goods for export. Later, according to the Ning Shao Paper Distribution and Sales Office, we received a telegram from Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating, 'The list of prohibited transportation materials to the enemy announced by the Zhejiang Customs refers to the prohibition of transportation to enemy countries and their colonies or mandated territories, and areas that have been forcefully controlled by the enemy. Since Shanghai has not been forcefully controlled by the enemy and has not been approved by the Ministry of Economy as a prohibited transportation area, all paper can still be transported and sold according to the original plan. Please comply accordingly.' Therefore, it is undoubtedly clear that Shanghai is not a prohibited transportation area, as clearly stated by the Zhejiang local authorities. However, the Zhejiang Customs does not allow exports because it has not received instructions from the ministry. Now, the commercial settlement period is approaching, and stopping transportation for one day will result in huge losses, and both livelihoods and finance are affected. We earnestly request your ministry to promptly instruct the Zhejiang Customs to allow the usual transportation and export of all kinds of goods from Ningbo to Shanghai, so as to maintain livelihoods and strengthen finance. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions."</p>
<h3>Yu's Unit of the Chinese Army in Pudong Forbids Occupation of Civilian Houses to Prevent Japanese Troops from Setting Fires</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in Pudong have been repeatedly attacked by guerrillas, and they are furious. They often resort to setting fire to civilian houses and killing innocent people as a retaliatory policy. Yu's unit of the Chinese army in Nanhui has issued a general order to the Gu, Yan, and Li battalions, instructing their subordinates to uniformly prohibit the occupation of civilian houses in the future, so as to prevent the Japanese troops from having any further excuses. Therefore, the various units have successively moved into public institutions or group schools and temples. Other units are also preparing to move, so as to prevent the Japanese side from succeeding in its poisonous scheme of pressuring the masses to report the whereabouts of the guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Schedules Taxpayers' Meeting for April 19th Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council recently decided on the dates for the election of council members and the annual meeting of taxpayers at its board meeting. The date for the election of council members for this year has been set for April 12th (Wednesday) and April 13th (Thursday). As for the annual meeting of taxpayers, it is scheduled for April 19th (Wednesday) from 2:30 PM, and will still be held at the Grand Theatre. The board's resolution has been recommended to the Consular Body.</p>
<h3>Coolidge Delays Departure One Day Due to Anchor Chain Entangling Propeller; Hired Divers to Saw it Off</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The American President Line's Coolidge arrived in Shanghai from America on January 31st. It was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Manila at 5:30 AM on February 1st. At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, the ship was prepared to depart. After the Japanese pilot boarded the ship, the engine was started. At that time, the sailors were also reeling in the anchor chain tied to the buoy. Among them, there were three anchor chains tied to buoy No. 11. Two of them had already been reeled in, and the remaining one could be reeled in within a few minutes. Suddenly, the stern of the ship slightly retreated, bringing it closer to the buoy. The anchor chain became entangled in the propeller, and the ship's engine could not be started. It was late at night, and the sailors had no way to rescue the situation, so the scheduled departure was delayed. At dawn, the shipping company hired craftsmen from the Rui Rong factory to try to repair it and sent divers to inspect it. It was found that as many as ten coils of the anchor chain were entangled in the propeller. At first, it was originally planned to remove the anchor chain, but after six or seven hours, there was no success. Later, it was decided to saw off the anchor chain. By about 4:00 PM, it was heard that five coils had been sawed off, and the rest would continue to be sawed off, so that it could be completed that night, so that the ship could depart for Hong Kong as usual at 6:00 AM this morning (the next day). It is heard that the ship's loss for being stranded in Shanghai for one day will be more than 10,000 yuan, and the passengers on the ship are extremely anxious.</p>

<h3>The Collapsed Tiger Cart Trade Petitions; Chinese Directors Express Sympathy and Agree to First Request the Authorities to Release the Detained Vehicles</h3>
<p>The Municipal Collapsed Tiger Cart Trade Mutual Aid Society, yesterday expanded its effort to request the Municipal Council to accept the society's proposal to terminate the extension of the stub axle replacement. It dispatched more than ten representatives to petition each Chinese director, and notified those whose vehicles were detained and unable to work, to temporarily endure hunger and starvation, and not to panic. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Expanded Petition: Yesterday morning, the council of the society appointed representatives Zou Shisong, Ke Huaxin, Wu Zhengyuan, Hong Ruqin, and more than ten others, along with the society's general managers Ge Futian and Gao Youyu, at 10:00 AM, first delivered a letter to the Sanbei Company, the office of Director Yu Qiaqing, and then to the Jingxing Building, the office of Director Xi Yushu, to petition, stating various difficulties and proposing three points, requesting that they lead them to personally request the Municipal Council's General Manager, Mr. Felippou, to accept and make flexible arrangements. At 2:00 PM, they went to the offices of Directors Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, and Guo Shun to make the same petition, and decided to send representatives again today to appeal to various organizations in the city for sympathy and assistance, and to make a unanimous request to the Municipal Council to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Questions Arise: According to the person in charge of the society, speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Municipal Council should have considered the society's request to cancel the stub axle replacement agreement, as it was petitioned twice to the Bureau on January 16th and 20th. However, recently, it suddenly believed that the number of licensed rickshaws had exceeded 10,000, and that the opposition was only a minority, so it changed its attitude and firmly refused to accept the society's request. However, according to the society's investigation, most of the military vehicles that have been licensed to the Municipal Council are unqualified, and there are serious questions about how the licenses were issued. The truth of the matter needs to be investigated. Therefore, when petitioning yesterday morning, they solemnly declared to the Chinese directors, requesting that they forward it to Mr. Felippou, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, and pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Notice to Members: Since the 29th of last month, the police stations have been implementing inspections, and according to reports to the society, more than 100 vehicles have been detained. The society's members are panicking due to the suspension of work and the impact on their livelihoods, and have been repeatedly requesting the society to negotiate for relief. However, due to their lack of knowledge and the nature of their lives, their attitudes are very impetuous. The society is sincerely afraid that its members will cause trouble and violate the law. Yesterday, it issued a notice to its members, roughly stating that during the negotiation period, it is inevitable that the police will detain vehicles. However, coolies are ultimately subject to control. If they are too impatient, they will not only fail to gain the sympathy and understanding of the Municipal Council, but may also be considered to have violated the law and suffer unexpected pain. Therefore, it is hoped that all rickshaw owners whose vehicles have been detained and who cannot work, will temporarily endure hunger and starvation, and wait patiently for the Chinese directors to mediate and seek a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Petition Situation: When the society's representatives petitioned the Chinese directors yesterday, the Chinese directors agreed to mediate. When the society's representatives set out to petition in the morning, all the rickshaw owners whose vehicles had been detained, and the rickshaw pullers who had not obtained licenses, followed them on the road, numbering more than 300. The society's general manager, Ge Futian, fearing that there would be too many people and that unexpected incidents would occur, immediately explained and guided them, and ordered Zhang Baosen, Lu Jinhong, and four others to be representatives and accompany the petition. When they arrived at the office of Chinese Director Xi Yushu in the Jingxing Building on Ningbo Road, South Henan Road, they dispersed, showing the rickshaw pullers' panic.</p>
<p>Chinese Directors Meeting: The society originally hoped that Directors Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu would lead them to meet with the General Manager of the Municipal Council to make a request. However, because there were too many rickshaw pullers following them, fearing misunderstandings at the Municipal Council, and because Director Yu Qiaqing had a cold and was not convenient to be disturbed, the original proposal was cancelled halfway and they did not go to the Municipal Council. After the Chinese directors were petitioned by the society's representatives, they all believed that the hardships of the laborers should be resolved. They gathered at the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday afternoon to discuss and decide to first request the authorities to release the detained vehicles in order to stabilize the livelihoods of the coolies. Regarding the termination of the extension of the stub axle replacement, the Chinese directors also believed that it was indeed a reasonable request.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Docking in Quanzhou; Protected by Their Own Country's Navy; Subject to Inspection by Customs and Military Police; The National Government is Not Responsible for Attacks by Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>The National Government's Military Affairs Commission has designated Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Hanjiang in Fujian as navigable ports. To maintain the commerce of friendly nations, it has stipulated regulations for foreign ships' traffic and inspection. All three navigable ports have been blockaded, and foreign ships are specially allowed to dock outside the blockade line. Now, the Fujian Provincial Government has specially designated that friendly foreign ships, such as those docking at the port of Quanzhou, must be protected by their own country's navy near the Tapu Island outside the blockade line. Barges loading and unloading goods must submit to the military authorities for approval and be subject to inspection by customs and military police. When departing, they must obtain a visa from the customs and the military authorities stationed at the blockade line. The National Government is not responsible for attacks by Japanese warships on friendly ships and barges, whether inside or outside the blockade line.</p>
<h3>This Year's Consular Court; American and German Consuls Appointed as Presiding Judges</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of Consuls has appointed the presiding judge and judges of the consular court for 1939. The United States Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, has been appointed as the presiding judge, and the British Consul-General, Mr. Phillip, and the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Miura, have been appointed as judges. The Council of Consuls has notified the Municipal Council and the consulates of various countries.</p>
<h3>Chinese Team of the Merchant Corps; Shixia Cup Finals; Small Target Shooting Competition; Li Yushu Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Shixia, the battalion commander of the Chinese Translators Team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps, has been in office for seven years since the "January 28th" Shanghai War. He is highly respected by his colleagues for his serious management, effective training, cooperation between superiors and subordinates, and fair arrangements. As a result, the team's performance has been improving and outstanding. When the team celebrated its 30th anniversary two years ago, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Zhi, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Chinese Team Association, presented a large silver cup to the team leader as a reward, named the Shixia Cup. The team leader declined with humility, and then donated it to the Chinese team members as a competition prize. It was stipulated that all team members who were fully present throughout the year would be eligible to participate in the competition as an encouragement. The intention was very good. It is reported that the first final competition was held in the Municipal Council training hall on the 25th of last month and at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The competition was small target shooting, with scores for hitting the bullseye, the moon target, and slow fire, with and without a rest, for a total of 20 shots, with a total of 80 points. After the competition on the 25th, Shen Linshu was the best. Yesterday was the final, and the competition was very intense. As a result, Mr. Li Yushu shot 72 points and won the championship, Mr. Zhou Qingen was second with 68 points, and Mr. Shen Linshu was third with 65 points. The trophy went to Mr. Li. The prize was awarded by Mrs. Chen, the team leader, amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers from the audience.</p>
<h3>French Consul Auchi; Returning to His Country for Vacation Soon; The China-France Friendship Association, etc.; Held Farewell Banquets Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, Mr. Auchi, the former Acting Consul-General of France in Shanghai, will return to his country for vacation soon. It is reported that the French Veterans Association in Shanghai held a farewell banquet for him last night. Yesterday noon, the China-France Friendship Association also held a farewell banquet. Both gatherings were very lively.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the Jewish Refugee Residence; A Primary School in Hongkou is Converted into a Dormitory; Everything is Available and There is Even a Theater</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that it was recently rumored that 1,000 Jewish refugees were coming to Shanghai. The reporter asked Mr. Spielman, the chairman of the European Jewish Refugee Committee, who said that he was also shocked by the news. The Shanghai people donated funds, clothing, and other items to the committee, so the refugees who have already come to Shanghai can still be taken care of. But when this large number of refugees comes to Shanghai, the committee will not be able to meet even half of their needs. The reporter was then led by several members of the committee to the</p>
<p>Refugee Residence:</p>
<p>across from the Western Prison on Huade Road for a tour. The place used to be a primary school. A month ago, it was allocated by the Municipal Council's committee to accommodate refugees. It has now been converted into a dormitory that can meet all the needs of the refugees. Two weeks later, the construction will be completed and it will be able to accommodate 1,200 people, including a hospital, a theater, a dining hall that can accommodate 200 people, and places for making clothing and shoes, which will be operated by the refugees themselves and serve only the refugees living there.</p>
<p>The converted dining hall</p>
<p>can also be used as a classroom. Double-decker iron beds have been placed in the bedrooms. The hospital, which is about to be completed, has isolation wards and a pharmacy for dispensing medicines. According to a committee member, the place will temporarily accommodate single men. When other places are completed, women and children will also be accommodated. The monthly cost of food and lodging per person is about 17.50 yuan. Currently, there are approximately</p>
<p>Two Thousand Three Hundred Jewish Refugees</p>
<p>in Shanghai. Four hundred of them are self-sufficient, so the remaining 1,900 have to be taken care of by the committee. Judging from the current situation, in addition to the 1,000 refugees who have already left Italy and are on their way to Shanghai, it is expected that another 1,000 people will come to Shanghai in the next month or so. Representatives of the two committees in charge of refugees are scheduled to meet this afternoon (the 1st) to discuss how to cope with the influx of a large number of impoverished people. The large number of refugees who arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Contessa on Sunday (the 29th) had to temporarily live in the</p>
<p>Jewish Church</p>
<p>on Museum Road, sleeping on straw mats on the floor, with two meals a day. A large number of other refugees are temporarily living in the Riverside Mansion. The committee is currently leasing suitable houses in the Hongkou district to meet the needs that will be encountered soon. Although the committee has been making every effort to find jobs for the refugees in China, so far there has been little success. This is a very difficult point for the committee.</p>
<h3>Former Russian Tax Collector in Beiping Comes to Shanghai; States the Circumstances of Being Slandered; The Puppet Authorities Accuse Him of Being Connected to the Communist Party and Order Him to Leave the Country; He Himself Has Never Been Involved in Politics and It Is Not Worth Refuting</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that Gu Nuofanlov, former advisor to the Chinese government and recently the Customs Commissioner in Beiping, and his wife, were accused of being directly connected to the Communist Party in Tianjin and were ordered to leave the country. After leaving North China on December 31st of last year, they arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month, but it was not until a few days ago that they met with reporters. He denied all the allegations made against him in North China. The reason why the Tianjin "authorities" arrested Mr. Gu was</p>
<p>to implement a release</p>
<p>, because it was alleged that Mrs. Gu often went to the Soviet Union, "apparently as a communication agent between Moscow, Leningrad, and the capitals of Germany, France, and Sweden." In addition, the "authorities" also claimed that Mr. Gu had a relative named Zhdanov, who was an important worker in the Communist Party in Moscow, Soviet Union. As far as is known, except for Andrei Zhdanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party, there are no</p>
<p>public officials</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union holding important positions with the name Zhdanov. Yesterday (the 31st), Mr. Gu stated that he not only had no relatives related to Andrei Zhdanov, but that he and his wife had no relatives named Zhdanov. Since coming to China from the Soviet Union in 1924, he and his wife had never returned to the Soviet Union, and he himself had never been in contact with politics. The accusations against him and his wife were</p>
<p>absurd and unfounded</p>
<p>and not worth refuting. Many of his friends can testify to this. It is reported that Mr. Gu joined the Chinese Customs in 1897, first working at the Yichang Customs as a fourth-class assistant, and was then transferred to the Beiping Customs. At that time, a special customs school was established in Beiping, where Mr. Gu taught Russian. In 1900, he was appointed as the personal secretary of Sir Robert Hart, the founder of the Chinese Customs. Three years later, he was transferred to the Yingkou Customs as the Customs Commissioner. After the Japanese occupied Yingkou, he</p>
<p>returned to Beiping</p>
<p>as the Customs Commissioner. In 1907, he participated in the negotiations between the Chinese and Russian governments on establishing a customs office in Harbin. When the Harbin Customs was established, Mr. Gu was the first Customs Commissioner. In 1910, when the Chinese delegation negotiated the 1881 treaty in St. Petersburg, Mr. Gu served as the delegation's technical advisor. Later, he served as an advisor to the Beiping Administration Bureau of the Chinese government. He retired in 1928, stayed in Beiping for five years, left China for Europe, and returned two years later. He decided to come to Shanghai to retire in the south of France.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Occupy the Chinese Merchants' Tram; Preparing to Resume Operations for Profit</h3>
<p>After the Japanese occupied the Chinese Merchants' Tram Company in Nanshi, after many days of repairs, all the factories and vehicles have been tidied up and painted. They are now training a group of inexperienced and foolish people to drive the trams, and plan to resume operations on the main lines during the New Year to make a profit.</p>
<h3>Southwest Cotton Production Expands; Henan and Shaanxi Seeds Distributed to Various Provinces; Cotton Production Gradually Increases Thereafter</h3>
<p>The Chinese government is making every effort to promote cotton production in the southwestern provinces to meet the needs of the yarn factories and people who have moved inland. It has distributed 7,000 seeds of cotton from Henan and Shaanxi provinces to the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. By the end of last year, the cotton-producing area in Sichuan had increased to 540,000 mu, Guizhou to 42,000 mu, Yunnan to 81,000 mu, and Guangxi to 12,000 mu. Cotton production in various provinces will gradually increase thereafter, and the results will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson's New Ship; The "Mingsheng" Arrives in Shanghai; Invites All Sectors to Visit; Invitations Have Been Sent</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson, a British company, has developed its shipping business in recent years. In addition to building the Taisheng and Yongsheng ships in Hong Kong last year, it also purchased four new ships from a certain company in Hong Kong, the Yisheng, Hesheng, Xinsheng, and Mingsheng. These four ships were built in the UK, with solid hulls and novel designs. Except for the Mingsheng, the other ships have arrived in Shanghai one after another to join the north-south shipping lines. It is now reported that the Mingsheng has also completed its painting and departed from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, arriving in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 3rd) at 7:00 AM, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf on Xinkai River in the French Concession. The company is scheduled to invite guests and colleagues to visit in the afternoon of the 3rd. Invitations have been sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Postal Bureau Resumed Yesterday; Small Parcel Post to Shaanxi and Gansu; Personal Small Parcels Also Accepted; The Weight Must Not Exceed One Kilogram</h3>
<p>The Joint Dispatch Group for Small Parcels of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday, stating that from now on, small parcels of medicine sent to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, those containing fully packaged medicines, and personal small parcels (limited to genuine personal small parcels; commercial small parcels sent by postal companies on behalf of others, even if they bear personal names, may not be accepted for delivery) can be resumed. However, each parcel must not exceed one kilogram. This is hereby announced. It is reported that the fee is three yuan per kilogram.</p>
<h3>"Aspirin" Is Not a Common Trademark</h3>
<p>The Chinese National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association previously submitted an application to register six trademarks, including "Aspirin," by Dade Paint Factory. At the time, the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was requested to re-evaluate on the grounds that the scope of use of each trademark was unclear, or that it was a commodity name, and could not be exclusively used according to law. Now, the Trademark Bureau has issued No. 92.</p>
<p>Re-evaluation Letter:</p>
<p>still maintaining the original ruling that "the request of the requester can be established." The reasons are as follows: The only reason for the requester's request for re-evaluation is that the (Aspirin) and the Chinese "Aspirin" trademarks have become commonly known drug names and are common trademarks, and have lost the special distinctiveness that trademarks should have, violating Articles 1, Section 2, and 14, and Article 2, Section 5 of the Trademark Law.</p>
<p>The respondent's reasons</p>
<p>roughly stated that the trademark in dispute was created by them, and that the trademark is known to a part of the Chinese people because of their efforts in promotion. Therefore, the key to resolving the case lies in investigating whether the trademark has become a common trademark. According to the fact that a trademark is a coined term at the time of registration, it is known to the general public in society because of the efforts of its owners in operation and promotion, and its distinctiveness is not reduced.</p>
<p>Its Exclusive Rights</p>
<p>cannot be restricted or prohibited as a result. It is obvious that trademarks known to the general public cannot be confused with the "commonly used trademarks in custom" stipulated in Article 2, Section 5 of the Trademark Law. The so-called "commonly used trademark in custom" refers to a trademark that anyone who operates the same product</p>
<p>can use</p>
<p>and is in fact commonly used. Because it is recorded as commonly used by the industry, the law allows one person to adopt it as a trademark, obtain exclusive rights, and prohibit others from citing it. The "Xuefang" trademark case cited by the requester is completely different from this case. The word "Xuefang" has long been in the custom of the Dongyang ham industry.</p>
<p>Common Trademark</p>
<p>Therefore, it cannot be exclusively used by anyone. The "Aspirin" trademark in this case was created by the respondent, which is an undisputed fact and has been registered according to law for many years, obtaining exclusive rights. The requester failed to provide evidence to prove that the trademark is commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry, and only stated that it is known to the general public and emptyly claimed that it is a "commonly used trademark in custom," which is not sufficient to adopt. Based on the above conclusions, the requester's reasons for the request cannot be established.</p>
<p>Municipal Council 1938</p>
<h3>Police Report (1)</h3>
<p>Last year, there were a total of 43 incidents of clashes between police officers and armed bandits. One police officer died and six were injured. Ten bandits died and 18 were injured.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel. The general level of newly recruited personnel has been fully maintained. There were still not enough Western police officers, and future recruitment will be done locally as much as possible within the scope of possibilities. A total of 193 newly recruited personnel were trained and assigned to duties, including 133 Chinese, 14 Westerners, and 20 Japanese. Among the newly employed Western personnel, 31 were recruited locally. Various review courses on management, transportation, security duties, and drills for Chinese and Indian constables were continued throughout the year. The discipline, conduct, and health of all police officers were satisfactory.</p>
<p>A total of 3,823 pieces of ordnance used by the police officers were repaired in the armory, which did not cost much. No defects were found in the firearms used in the clashes with the bandits.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the reserve team has been fully maintained at its high level. Last year, the team went to 27 places where bomb cases occurred, one factory where riots occurred, 20 places where bandits robbed, and two places where gun battles occurred. It also assisted in the arrest of armed bandits in two cases. In addition, it was responsible for guarding, searching, patrolling, guarding, and protecting.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the mounted patrol隊 had seven large horses and 39 small horses.</p>
<p>There were a total of 507 special police officers. Twenty-seven new ones were recruited and 91 resigned. The special police officers at all levels held two pistol shooting exercises with excellent results. The special police officers were ordered to be on duty on various commemorative days last year, and the efficiency was good.</p>
<p>The telegraphic printing machine is still in use, and the overall effect is very good. Street telephones are also an effective tool for transmitting police news. Patrol cars equipped with wireless radios have not been used due to insufficient personnel allocation. However, when reserve team vehicles patrolled, they still used wireless radios to communicate with the police station. Some of the armored vehicles of the merchant corps have also been equipped with wireless radios, which makes communication with the police more convenient.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, there were 154 refugee camps in the Public Concession, accommodating a total of more than 90,000 refugees. In addition, there were no less than several thousand refugees living in empty houses in the alleys. Later, some of the refugees were sent back to their hometowns, and some camps were merged, so by the end of the year, the number of camps had been reduced to 68, accommodating 50,000 refugees. Various public organizations and charitable organizations in the city continued to raise funds to help the refugees. There were 21 factory strikes, less than one-sixth of the number in the previous year, affecting more than 6,000 workers and losing more than 27,000 working days. There were no strikes in the first quarter of last year, one in April, and an average of two or three in each of the remaining months. The factories where strikes occurred included 10 silk weaving factories, 2 printing factories, and 3 cigarette factories. In addition to strikes, there were 23 recorded labor disputes, mostly due to disputes over dismissal, wage reduction, and payment of severance pay. A total of 25 people were arrested throughout the year for striking or inciting labor unrest. The industrial sector in the city suffered severely due to the war, and a large number of workers were unemployed. A small number of factories resumed operations at the beginning of last year, employing some workers. Later, the state of the industrial sector improved day by day, and more and more factories resumed operations.</p>
<p>The city's residents' food problem was quite serious at the end of the previous year. Fortunately, foreign rice was imported to remedy the situation. After April last year, the source of rice became more abundant, and there was no need to worry about food for the people. The average rice prices last year were as follows: First-class domestic rice, 13.66 yuan per dan; medium, 12.59 yuan; ordinary, 11.45 yuan; Saigon rice, 8.3 cents per catty.</p>

<h3>Intense Gunfire at Xin Kang Li: Geng Shoubao Shot and Killed; The Deceased Was a Shameless Collaborator Whose Evil Deeds Were Numerous; Over Ten Men Fired More Than Forty Shots, Stray Bullets Injuring Six, One Fatally and One Severely</h3>
<p>Geng Shoubao, a local resident, 32 years old, currently residing in a bungalow at 491 Kang Nao Tu Road, a road built outside the concession in western Shanghai, relied on his relationship with Lu Ying, a disciple of the then-Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Squad Leader, before the war in Shanghai. Through this connection, he managed to obtain the position of captain of the Second Squad of the Detective Division of the Caojiadu branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. At that time, Geng immediately abused his authority, taking advantage of the special circumstances to exploit the people, colluding with Lu Ying to amass wealth through extensive extortion. He also recruited many followers and cultivated a private clique, thus establishing a significant evil influence in the Caojiadu area. At that time, the authorities were planning to bring him to justice, but unfortunately, the war broke out, and the matter was shelved. Soon after, both Lu and Geng lost their jobs. Unexpectedly, after the Chinese army withdrew, Lu Ying became insane and shamelessly served the enemy, accepting the position of "Police Bureau Chief of the Shanghai Dadao (Great Way) Municipal Government," a puppet regime. Geng Shoubao also took the same position at that time, appointed by Lu as the "Detective Squad Leader" of the puppet "Police Bureau." After accepting the puppet mandate, Geng Shoubao relied on his numerous accomplices to intensify his evil deeds, committing all kinds of atrocities. Furthermore, seeing the recent prevalence of gambling and opium dens in western Shanghai, he resumed his old tricks, providing protection and engaging in extensive extortion. Although he had only taken office for less than two months, his skillful methods allowed him to accumulate a considerable amount of money. At the same time, Geng Shoubao was aware that he had made many enemies and was wary, so he hired four bodyguards to serve as his guards, accompanying him whenever he went out, thinking that he could rest easy from then on. Unexpectedly, the more he tried to prevent trouble, the more quickly it came. At about 7:45 yesterday morning, Geng, dressed in a Western suit, left his home, intending to go to the puppet "Police Branch Bureau" to "work." As he was passing Xin Kang Li on Kang Nao Tu Road, he suddenly noticed more than ten men acting suspiciously in that area, rushing toward him from behind. Knowing that something was wrong, he immediately turned into a gambling den near Dasheng in Qi Kang Li to seek refuge. After about twenty minutes, Geng thought that the pursuers had left, so he came out again. Unexpectedly, the plotters had increased in number. As soon as they saw Geng Shoubao emerge from the alley, more than twenty people each drew their guns and fired at Geng. At that time, the sound was like a string of beads, and bullets flew like rain, reaching over forty shots. Geng Shoubao was shot down to the ground. Because he was hit by eleven bullets, all in vital areas, he died immediately. All the murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, immediately scattered and fled without a trace. At the same time, six pedestrians, unable to avoid the attack, were also injured by the bullets. Among them, an old man unfortunately died on the spot. In addition, Zhu Kaoer from Jiangyin, 44 years old, was hit by three bullets, injuring his hands, feet, and legs; Lu Zishi from Chongming, 55 years old, was hit by one bullet, injuring his right hand; Yu Guoyun, a five-year-old child from Ningbo, was hit by one bullet, injuring his left foot; Sun Guohuan from Shaoxing, 27 years old, was hit by one bullet, injuring his right hand; Wang Xi'en from Zhenjiang, 30 years old, was hit by one bullet, injuring his throat. For a time, cries of pain filled the air, and the road was stained with blood. At this time, the Gordon Road Police Station received a report. The Chinese Detective Chief Zhu Mengwei led detectives to the scene to investigate. At that time, Geng's body had already been taken away by the puppet "Dadao Municipal Government" vehicle. The wounded were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Wang Xi'en was severely injured and his life was in danger. In addition, the detectives found more than ten bullet casings nearby, as well as a leaflet bearing the name "China Youth Anti-Traitor Corps," which read "Strike Down the Traitors." These items were brought back to the police station for filing, while investigations into the case began. Therefore, whether Geng's murder was related to political affairs or revenge remains to be reported.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Leased Ship: Closing Arguments Concluded, Verdict Pending; Police Lawyer Believes Defendants Committed Fraud, Requests Severe Punishment According to Law</h3>
<p>The Yi Tai Shipping Company had previously leased the Minhang-registered ship from the Min Nan Shipping Company. After the withdrawal of the National Army, the ship was detained by the Japanese. Later, it was freed through various means, and the flag was changed. It continued to operate as usual. Until November of last winter, Zhu Yousong and others formed the Dade Shipping Company and leased the ship, intending to operate on coastal routes. Yi Tai learned that Dade intended to change the flag again, which violated the lease agreement between them and Min Nan. Cao Hongyi, the manager of Yi Tai, negotiated with Zhu Yousong, and both parties agreed to terminate the lease. The 4,000 yuan in legal tender received from Dade as ship rental was settled with a promissory note. At that time, Luo Wanxiang, the owner of the Dagong Customs Brokerage, established a Hankou Shipping Company and appointed Shi Guangchang, a Suzhou native, as manager. He leased the ship from Cao, and a dispute arose when Luo paid the rent. Luo accused them of fraud and reported them to the police. The police arrested Shi, Cao, and Wu Chaohua, the former manager of Yi Tai, Ma Chengbeng, the owner of Yuan Tai Heng Weaving, and Huang Zhichu, a ship broker, who were also involved in the fraud, and brought them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. At this time, Zhu Yousong filed a complaint against Cao for fraud and sued all the shareholders of Yi Tai for damages. Judge Zhong conducted investigations, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing continued. The reply from the Jianghai Customs regarding the court's inquiry about the ship's whereabouts had been sent to the court, stating that according to the report of an Italian merchant, the Wan Na-registered ship was bought back by the original owner, Min Nan Company, on December 12. On the 15th, the ship suddenly left its original berth and its whereabouts were unknown. Judge Zhong then continued to question Luo Wanxiang about the issue of the flag when the ship was rented and set sail. According to Luo, it was not necessary to fly the Japanese flag when sailing to coastal ports, but it might be necessary to have relations with the Japanese in order to be allowed to sail. However, although there was a letter from Shi Guangchang to him stating that the cooperation with the Tianli Shipping Company had not been finalized, Luo still insisted that it had been. After being questioned by the court, Shi Guangchang stated that after the ship was leased, it was decided to join Tianli for cooperation, so the pass was also obtained from the Japanese army by Tianli. All these matters were instructed by Luo, and he, Shi, handled them on behalf of the Hankou Company as manager. Later, because the pass could not be obtained, he sent a letter to Luo resigning from his position. As for the fact that the ship was indeed handed over by Cao on December 6, Cao Hongyi also continued to provide details, saying that when Shi Guangchang and Chen Defu first came to discuss the lease, they said they were sailing to coastal ports. He immediately told them that the Dade Company also wanted to lease the ship to sail that route, and to change to the Japanese flag, which he would not allow and would terminate the lease. Shi and others then said that they were leasing to sail to coastal ports and would never fly the Japanese flag, so they began negotiations. Unexpectedly, a few hours after the ship was handed over on the 6th, two Japanese suddenly boarded the ship to change to the Japanese flag. After negotiations and prevention, the Tianli pass could not be obtained, etc. The court believed that the case was clear and ordered the closing arguments to begin. First, Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, stated that the facts of the case confirmed that the defendants had colluded in fraud and requested that they be punished according to law. Then, the lawyers for the defendants defended, all arguing that Luo Wanxiang was cunning and did not want to be seen as a traitor, so he used Shi Guangchang as a front. Later, he intended to destroy the deal and made this preemptive accusation, requesting that all defendants be declared innocent and that the civil lawsuit filed by the two plaintiffs be rejected, etc. As a result, the defendants were remanded in custody, and a date was set for the verdict to be announced.</p>
<h3>Seduction of Dancer An: Improper Jurisdiction, Second Special Court Refuses to Accept</h3>
<p>Yang Lingmei, a girl from Ningbo who used to work as a dancer in the mainland ballroom, 17 years old, formerly residing at 32 Fangjia Alley, Daxi Road, a road built outside the concession in western Shanghai, was seduced by Zhu Xiasheng (19 years old), a neighbor and fellow villager who worked as a waiter at the Hollywood Ballroom, around the spring of this year according to the lunar calendar. After the seduction, the girl's parents moved out and opened rooms in the Zhongnan Hotel and the Chunjiang Third Inn, continuing to have sexual relations and making a lifelong commitment to marry her. On October 7, the girl's sister, Yang Shenghong, found her and took her back. Zhu personally wrote a statement agreeing to marry Yang. Later, Zhu regretted his decision and married another woman, neglecting Yang. Yang's mother, Yang Lu, as her legal guardian, hired a lawyer and filed a criminal complaint of seduction and abandonment against Zhu Xiasheng in the First Special Court. The defendant, Zhu Xiasheng, also hired a lawyer to argue the issue of jurisdiction. Judge Yuan opened a hearing and ordered Zhu to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan, setting a deadline for further questioning. The details were reported in this newspaper on the 24th of last month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao continued the hearing. Both parties and their lawyers appeared in court. After questioning both sides about the location of the crime, which was in the road built outside the concession, the court announced the judgment that the jurisdiction was improper. The proceedings of this case must wait until the Nanshi Court resumes operations before they can continue.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Maidservant: Xu Xue氏 Released on Bail Awaiting Verdict; Maidservant Temporarily Sent to济良所</h3>
<p>Xu Xue氏, a woman from Qingpu residing at 3, Lane 264, Hart Road, her husband, Xu Wenda, works at the telephone company. Two years ago, Xue氏 spent 50 yuan to buy a 12-year-old Ningbo girl, A Jin, as a maidservant to do all the work. Yesterday, the中華慈幼恊會 suddenly received a report letter stating that Xu Xue氏 had repeatedly abused the maidservant, beating her with wooden sticks, and requesting rescue. The Association immediately instructed staff member Liu Wenlin to report to the 静安寺 Police Station according to the information and instructed Chinese detective Qian Guobin to investigate and arrest Xu Xue氏, along with the maidservant A Jin. The girl was sent to 廣仁 Hospital, and it was found that her left arm had bruises and both hands had frostbite, so she was sent to 济良所. Xu Xue氏 was detained and sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed charges of injury according to Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and described the case. He also cited the maidservant A Jin's testimony that she had been beaten by the mistress with a stick before serving as a maidservant in Xu's house because she did not do her work well, but she was not usually beaten often. When questioned, the defendant Xu Xue氏 stated that she learned that A Jin went out the other day and hung on the streetcar, so she persuaded her not to do so. She was disobedient, so she slightly beat her, etc. She also hired Xu Yin 律师 to defend her in court. After Judge Liu verified the供词, he announced that the defendant would be released on bail of 100 yuan and postponed the verdict to this Friday. A Jin was temporarily sent to 济良所 for custody.</p>
<h3>Director of Nanshi Fu Shun Tang Shelter Embezzles Funds and Deducts Food Rice and Winter Clothing; Ren Linsen Has Been Dismissed and Is Under Investigation</h3>
<p>There is a Fu Shun Tang Shelter run by a礼敎所 in Nanshi, Nine Mu Di. The Tang first opened when Shanghai south fell, with several branches, and accommodated a large number of refugees. Initially, the person in charge was Ren Xipeng, a staff member of the Tang. Later, Ren was attacked, so Ren's son took over. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters stationed in Nanshi recently received a complaint from a large number of refugees accusing Ren's son of deducting food, embezzling winter clothes. The Japanese reported the matter, and on the morning of the day before yesterday, they ordered several Japanese soldiers to go to the Tang with the Shanghai International Refugee Relief Committee to search the premises. They found more than 1,000 pieces of unissued winter clothes and dozens of dan of refugee rice on the spot (the refugees' food rice in each shelter is领到 from the Relief Committee every day and must not be left over to the next day in order to prevent abuses). Ren's son, the person in charge, and the seized winter clothes and food rice were all taken away. Since the case occurred, the International Relief Committee has attached great importance to it.</p>
<p>Ren Linsen of Shanghai Fu Shun Shantang in the Nanshi refugee area, under the guise of Shantang, set up a donation register and solicited donations from all walks of life. Most of the money and goods raised went into his own pockets. The puppet police authorities in Nanshi, based on a secret report, sent personnel to search and arrested Ren Linsen of the 社. He is now under close investigation. At the same time, Father Rao, the founder of the refugee area, believing that Ren Linsen also served as the district chief of the Seventh District of the area, could not avoid deducting the refugees' clothing and rice, ordered the headquarters to dismiss Ren and cancel the name of the Seventh District. All refugees in the district's shelters were transferred to other districts.</p>
<h3>Two Escaped Prisoners Healed and Interrogated; Sentencing Set for the 8th</h3>
<p>Murderer Liu Yuepo from Taixing threw a bomb at Hualong Elementary School on Hualong Road on the afternoon of March 4 of last year, causing student Yin Xingyuan to be injured and die. Liu was arrested on the spot and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After three trials in the Higher Branch Court and the Supreme Court, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison. During the retrial appeal period, he was detained in the bald head of the detention center attached to the Second Special Prison on Masnan Road. Wang Shaoting (from Fengyang, Anhui), a robber, was sentenced to seven years in prison for his crime. He was held in the same prison cell as Liu. Unexpectedly, on the night of November 23 of last year, taking advantage of the guards' negligence, Liu and Wang sawed off the iron bars in the prison cell and fled. The guards discovered this and reported it to the competent department and requested the 法警务处 to send detectives to arrest them. At dawn the next morning, the detectives arrested Liu and Wang at Liu's home at 100 Macau Road in western Shanghai and at the entrance of the Luban Road Continental Alley and brought them back to the police station. Because the two criminals were injured when they jumped over the wall to escape, they were sent to廣慈 Hospital for treatment. The case was transferred to the Second Special Court, and the administrative authorities of the French Concession filed a public prosecution based on the crime of destroying the detention facilities and escaping according to the Criminal Law and requested an extension to wait for the two criminals to recover before questioning them again. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Because the injuries of Liu and Wang have fully recovered, the hospital notified the Police Department to take them back into custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Second Special Court came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Yuan Jiahong, the lawyer representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, described the case and the articles of the indictment. Liu confessed that Wang designed the escape. When Wang was questioned, he admitted that they had planned the escape together. Wang also admitted. After verifying the confessions, the court announced the end of the trial and set the sentencing for the 8th. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Over Extortion: Trial Concluded, Verdict Pending; Defendant Denies Committing the Crime</h3>
<p>The thug Chen Along, at 8 PM on December 27 of last year, together with his accomplices, went to the middle厢房 on the ground floor of 66 Ruifu Alley, Zilaihu Street in the French Concession, to extort money from Xu Bingsheng (nicknamed "Blind Ah Fu"), a Wuxi native who sold morphine. A verbal altercation and quarrel ensued. There were no electric lights in the room, only a 洋烛火 which was blown out. In the darkness, Chen was stabbed in a vital area with a sharp knife and died on the spot. The murderer and Chen's accomplices, seeing that they had caused a disaster, all fled. Later, the French Police Department sent detectives to arrest Xu Bingsheng, his mistress Xu Wu氏, and suspect Shao Rongbao. It was found that Xu had been sentenced to one year and four months in prison by the First Special Court for a morphine case in previous years. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Shao Rongbao and Xu Wu氏 were found to be unrelated to the case and were released first. Only Xu Bingsheng was indicted for murder. The deceased's daughter, Li Zhang氏, hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit, stating that the deceased Chen Along, also known as Li Along, was killed innocently and demanding damages and funeral expenses totaling 20,780 yuan, etc. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Zhang Minsheng, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren, continued the hearing and appointed lawyer Wang Shizong to defend the defendant. The police detectives presented the sharp knife, iron rod, and iron ruler, which were found in the defendant's home after the incident, as evidence. When questioned, Xu denied selling morphine, stating that the deceased bought a package of morphine from Xiao Suzhou, but he did not feel well after consuming it and came with several people to argue with Xiao Suzhou. A verbal altercation, quarrel, and fight ensued. He was suffering from a fever and chills, and when he saw them fighting, he hid under the bed. When he came out after they left, the deceased had been stabbed to death. He did not use a knife to commit the crime, etc. At this point, the court believed that the case was clear and ordered the closing arguments. After the prosecutor's opinion, lawyer Gu Shouxi of the French Administrative Authorities and the defendant's defense lawyer debated, and the court announced the end of the trial and set the verdict for the 6th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Macau Road Robbery Case: Five Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>At 8:20 PM on the day before yesterday, the home of Yu Xiaozhang at 43 Macau Road was suddenly invaded by several robbers, who brandished pistols, threatened them to remain silent, and robbed them of valuables worth 180 yuan and 5 jiao before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Chief Feng Baishun, Detectives Yuan Xinzhong and Zhang Youming, and Detective Zhang Changkun arrested three local robbers, Ding Maotou, Ding Zhaosheng, and Ding Zhanggen, at 156 Pushanli, Gordon Road. It was learned that they had conspired in a room at the Changhua Hotel on Fujian Road beforehand. Detective Chief Feng, together with Western detectives, rushed to the hotel and arrested two more women, Ding Wu氏 and Ding Chen氏. The five men and women, including Ding Maotou, were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for robbery with violence under Article 330 of the Criminal Law and requested an extension for investigation. Subsequently, Detective Chief Feng reported the details. After Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bao Repeatedly Publishes Obscene Text: Kuang Menghuai Fined Again; Kuang Declares Disagreement and Files an Appeal</h3>
<p>The small newspaper "Shanghai Bao" at 36 Meirenli, Hankou Road, was sentenced to fines three times by the court last year for repeatedly publishing obscene text. The content of the novel "顚鸞艷影記" published in the newspaper on the 8th and 9th of last month was extremely obscene. The工部局's Political Department filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court according to law. On the 25th of last month, the Special Court sentenced Kuang Menghuai, the editor of the newspaper, to a fine of 300 yuan. However, Zhang Yi, a detective from the Political Department, found that the newspaper had repeatedly published "捉刀六記" and "天津小姐" by Zhang Qinglin from January 14 to 16. There were also elements that offended public morals. Therefore, lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the工部局's Legal Department filed a complaint with the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Fang Qinghuan opened the Fourth Criminal Court and ordered Kuang Menghuai to appear in court. Kuang stated that the Police Department had not warned him beforehand and that the newspaper had stopped publishing the stories related to public morals after receiving the court's summons. Therefore, he had no intention of committing a crime. Moreover, it was a continuous act and he had already been heavily penalized, which he could not afford. He requested the court to investigate. Judge Fang核稟 and announced the judgment that Kuang Menghuai repeatedly disseminated obscene text and would be fined 300 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he would be forced to work. Kuang declared his disagreement in court and stated that he would file an appeal.</p>

<h3>New Factory Completed: Taiyi Malt Extract Powder Factory</h3>
<p>Taiyi Malt Extract Powder Factory in this city was founded by Mr. Zhang Jingchu from Ninghai, Zhejiang. The first factory was established in 1919 at Hai Lu Zhi Road, Zhabei, and the second factory was established in 1923 at Beile Road in the French Concession.

The road from Chongqing to Kunming, Yunnan, has been open to traffic for a long time, but the section from Yunnan to the Myanmar border requires passing through a new road recently built by the National Government.</p>

<h3>Eating Habits of Famous People</h3>
<p>— Yisu</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek likes to eat roast pigeons. When he was in Whampoa, he often went to Taiping Restaurant in Taiping Sha for a big meal. Ye Chucang likes peanuts and enjoys drinking. Five years ago, he competed with British Ambassador Lampson in drinking. As a result, Ye fell drunk after 54 cups, while Lampson also fell unconscious after drinking 55 cups.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma Junwu is very fond of cigarettes. Mr. Feng Yuxiang, on the other hand, is the opposite. When he ruled the Northwest Army in the past, one day he went to the office of Secretary-General Wei and felt the smell of smoke. Feng pretended not to know, but recited aloud: "Your house is smoky and smelly, smelly and smoky, both smoky and smelly, both smelly and smoky, smoky and smelly, smelly and smoky, smoky and smelly, also smoky and smelly, also smelly and smoky." After speaking, he turned his head and left. Mr. Wei was ashamed and quit smoking.</p>
<p>The late philanthropist Wang Yiting always puts the remaining matchsticks after smoking in the matchbox and is reluctant to throw them away. When others smoke and strike a match, he uses the matchsticks to ignite the cigarette.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong likes to eat oranges, Wang Chonghui likes to eat lean oil porridge, and Zhu De likes to eat steamed buns and large pancakes.</p>
<h3>Clothing Outside Clothing</h3>
<p>— Shuangxi Yiye</p>
<p>Suits have always had overcoats. If you wear a suit without an overcoat, it's like a fledgling bird, with a shabby look. That kind of awkward taste of relying on others everywhere, or thinking of the "strong grass" in "Strong Wind", is not easy to find. In fact, overcoats are sometimes not for keeping warm, but mostly for maintaining appearances.</p>
<p>At present, in addition to the Chinese gown, it is also popular to wear an overcoat. This clothing outside clothing is naturally much more magnificent in appearance, but in reality it seems a bit like "a donkey in tiger skin." However, the general trend is that it seems that this garment cannot be less.</p>
<p>Friends all say that clothing outside requires clothing—an overcoat. Without an overcoat, it seems that the function of wearing clothes has not been fully realized. Therefore, for overcoats, most people who pay attention to clothing must make a final struggle. In fact, why bother, really, why bother.</p>
<p>"Reducing clothing", if you want to express it concretely, then you should first reduce the clothing outside the clothing—the overcoat. But Chinese people often have more slogans than actions. Positive slogans must be supplemented by opposing actions. As soon as the shout of reducing clothing stops, the father immediately goes to add clothing, as if reducing clothing is only worthy of being shouted, and adding clothing is the footnote of reducing clothing. This contradiction is really painful to say. But there is no way to correct it, so you have to listen to it. If you don't listen to it, then what?</p>
<p>Speaking of the initial mission of clothing, it is very simple, that is: "Clothing is for covering the body." Logically speaking, covering the body is enough, including keeping warm, and other trivial issues should be discarded. However, after sliding from neatness to gorgeousness, it almost stripped the true meaning of clothing. At the same time, people who "look down on others" have emerged one after another, thinking that "when returning home, the first thing to look at is clothing." This situation, deeply rooted in the country, grabs the psychology of most people, so they work diligently, only paying attention to clothing, planning it, and planning it, creating social hypocrisy. And it is not only hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I am not using the topic of "clothing outside clothing" to criticize our compatriots, but now that the country has reached this point, this expense seems to be able to be saved. Moreover, looking at the past, Chinese-style overcoats are mostly imported. Personal economy and national leakage are all related. Even if it is for keeping warm, why not change to making silk and cotton padded jackets to be lighter and warmer?</p>
<h3>New Voices in Housing</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Italy's recent contribution to the science of life is the invention of a "sunflower" house. It rotates on a concentric track, so that the living room always faces the sun. The power is supplied by a three-horsepower engine located in the center of the house.</p>
<p>There is a glass hotel in Doncaster, England. It is declaring that glass can also be used as a building material. The outer walls and the inner rooms—even the floors and furniture—are all made of glass in various colors. The floor is composed of many small squares of colored glass, and it is not slippery to walk on.</p>
<p>In Chicago, there is a department store called Sears, and except for the display windows on the ground floor and the offices on the top floor, you can hardly see a window. However, the engineer who built the house said that its temperature and light will not be worse than buildings with windows, and can invisibly save us a lot. Because the goods damaged by sunlight, fireworks, and stains can be reduced, and the outside noise can also be isolated, which is especially beneficial because we will get more space to display goods.</p>
<p>Although walls and roofs can separate living rooms from the outside world, a large amount of heat will still escape from the windows. In order to overcome this shortcoming, American glass workers have made a double-layered glass window, which is to put two pieces of glass into a window frame at the same time. The dead air sealed in it acts as an obstacle to prevent heat from escaping, and moisture is also prevented from entering.</p>
<h3>I Can't Help But Admire It Very Much</h3>

<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Dried mushrooms are also an important auxiliary product in dishes, and almost everyone loves to eat them. Only because most of them came from Japan before, everyone is unwilling to eat them, which is very respectable. But our country also produces them, not all of them are imported. Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, which is famous for porcelain (now called Fuliang), is the place of origin of dried mushrooms. The dried mushrooms produced are cheap and good, and are really above imported products. The top-quality products only cost one yuan and eight jiao per catty, and the flower mushrooms only cost about two yuan per catty. Each one is very thick. When cooked together in dishes, the taste is very delicious. Originally, when winter bamboo shoots are on the market, stir-frying the two winters is a seasonal dish in restaurants, and the price is very expensive. I didn't dare to add it to the economic menu for this reason, but recently the price has gone down; so let's have a stir-fried two winters to try this week. What is called stir-fried two winters? It is stir-fried winter bamboo shoot slices and dried mushrooms. It seems a bit uneconomical to use whole dried mushrooms, so you may want to look at the size of each one and cut it into two or four pieces, which can save a lot.</p>

<h3>Winter Clothing Selection</h3>
<p>— Yuren</p>
<p>The first requirement for winter clothing is that it does not conduct heat, so that body temperature is not dissipated to the outside. There are also points called "warm," "soft," and "light," which are also indispensable. To have the above advantages, it is naturally necessary to use wool fabrics. Therefore, pure wool fabrics are the first choice for winter clothing, followed by silk and wool interwoven fabrics. Cotton fabrics also have a considerable effect on maintaining body temperature. The most undesirable thing is rayon fabrics, which not only cannot maintain the body's own heat, but also contradict the three essentials of warmth, softness, and lightness mentioned above: cold, hard, and heavy. In fact, rayon fabrics are not only unsuitable for winter clothing, but also not very suitable in other seasons, because they are not durable, easily wrinkled, and especially clothes that need to be washed cannot be put in water. What's more, rayon is basically a foreign product, and most of the goods imported by unscrupulous merchants these days are private goods. If our 40 million compatriots each have a rayon garment, and the average is assumed to be one yuan in national currency, the number is already alarming, and the British and American loans can be paid off in full!</p>

<h3>Necessary Treatment for Premature Aging and Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, graduated from the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Those who feel neurasthenia before the age of forty are generally called premature aging. If young people excessively masturbate or indulge in sexual desire after marriage, this disease is inevitable.</p>
<p>The short life span of Chinese people is indeed undeniable. Seeing that many young people suffer from neurasthenia or kidney deficiency, which leads to a lack of determination to make progress, this is not only a loss for them personally, but also the main reason for the weakness of the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of premature aging, such as mental malaise, easy forgetfulness, feeling tired after a little work, difficulty falling asleep at night, dizziness, and memory loss, those who have these symptoms before the age of forty are generally called premature aging.</p>
<p>As for kidney deficiency, it refers to the decline of reproductive function. Symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility all belong to it, and have a related relationship with premature aging, because those who suffer from premature aging have this sad symptom.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, young people should have abundant vitality, so there should be no such problems. However, due to masturbation and indulgence in sexual desire, the above-mentioned diseases are caused.</p>
<p>In that case, the essences of the youth glands (i.e., the testicles) of strong animals are injected into the human body. That is to promote its prosperity, relieve its premature aging, and restore its inherent energy, so as to achieve rejuvenation. This is the latest invention of modern medicine, organ therapy.</p>
<p>Since the testicles are important reproductive organs, premature aging and kidney deficiency are caused by the dysfunction of this organ. Now, if we take the testicular essence of young animals to nourish the deficiency, it is indeed the most fundamental way to treat the symptoms.</p>
<p>For example, a forty-year-old person feels that his energy is declining. After engaging in this type of therapy, the above-mentioned malpractices can be delayed for at least ten years before they occur. Its treatment results have been definitely proven in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Testicular essence agent for men "Buti Kang" has a long history in the application of organ therapy. We doctors have accurately recognized its medicinal power. It generates essence and nourishes the kidneys in 24 hours, so it has the great functions of invigorating the nerves, nourishing the kidneys, nourishing the blood, and nourishing the brain. Whether the patient's disease belongs to premature ejaculation, or neurasthenia, premature aging, or even incomplete development, infertility after marriage, after taking "Buti Kang", he will get the effect of rejuvenation. In one thousand cases, there are almost no disappointed ones.</p>
<p>The reason why "Buti Kang" can exert outstanding efficacy is actually due to precise extraction. The animal glandular element used is mainly chimpanzee, so its efficacy can surpass other agents.</p>
<p>Women should take "Buti Kang" for women's diseases</p>
<h3>On the Treatment of Nocturnal Emission After a Habit of Self-Indulgence</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>If the bad habit of self-indulgence becomes a habit, then the frequency of nocturnal emission will also increase, which can lead to chronic urethritis, urethral leakage, and relaxation of the vas deferens. Seeing a member of the opposite sex will immediately cause nocturnal emission, so that person's energy is depleted, their complexion is pale, their development is incomplete, their sexual function is weak, they often have dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, mental palpitations, tinnitus, night sweats, and a sharp decrease in appetite. The heart and stomach. Although no major diseases have been discovered, all kinds of obstacles can strike at any time.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of nocturnal emission caused by self-indulgence, the most important thing is health preservation, and then the German special medicine for nocturnal emission, "Nairs Nocturnal Emission Tablets," can be used to cure it. In case the person is too weak due to prolonged nocturnal emission, "Buti Kang," a German testicular essence preparation for men that nourishes the brain, kidneys, and blood, can be taken in conjunction. This has been proven to be highly effective in clinical trials. Famous doctors around the world unanimously recommend it and praise it highly, especially because its ingredients are pure and refined, and it is by no means comparable to ordinary endocrine preparations.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Chronicles</p>
<h3>The Practice of Curing Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Theory should be combined with practice. If the theory is irrelevant to practice, then it is only empty talk and does not help the facts. Why should such empty theory be valued? Therefore, all scientific theories are based on practical evidence as the most important thing.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many treatments for gonorrhea, causing patients to be at a loss. It is inevitable that they have a feeling of wandering on a path. This is tantamount to adding a layer of suffering from the problem of treatment in addition to the suffering of the disease. Therefore, as doctors, we have an unavoidable responsibility to provide guidance on the treatment of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience of more than ten years, of course, all the treatments for gonorrhea that people know how to use, I have used them all. The so-called local therapy, chemical therapy, transmembrane sterilization therapy, and leukorrhea drugs that claim to be able to eradicate the disease in three to five days have all been tried, and the process has been carefully recorded. The advantages and disadvantages of the above-mentioned various treatments do not have a fixed standard, because these treatments are actually mostly unhelpful. According to my experience, the gonorrhea special medicine "Kelinong" invented by German Dr. Peter is the comet for treating gonorrhea. This agent is based on the principle of non-specific therapy, using a mixture of protein and pigment, and has undergone countless experiments and gradual improvements to achieve success. Doctors and specialized venereal disease hospitals in various countries have adopted it as a special oral medicine for gonorrhea. For example, the countries of Norway were countries where gonorrhea was rampant. Now, due to the invention of the drug "Kelinong", the number of patients has been drastically reduced. This can prove the general effectiveness of this agent. In general, over-the-counter drugs on the market or leukorrhea that is difficult to treat with other surgeries or that has been repeatedly treated without success are especially effective when taken. Generally, new drugs for treating gonorrhea only work if they have actual bactericidal power, and only then can they be eradicated. "Kelinong" is the crystallization of success obtained from actual efficacy, so it can be popular all over the world. For external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" to wash themselves according to the instructions in the manual. Women can use "Karsher Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories for external use, which will be even more effective (Note: "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is sold in both Zhongxi Taihe pharmacies in this city).</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Is the Elimination of Gonorrhea Truly a Radical Cure?</p>
<p>Clear Urine is Insufficient Evidence: It is dangerous to judge whether gonorrhea is cured based on whether the urine is clear or not. In fact, most chronic gonorrhea cases have clear urine, and the patients themselves feel this phenomenon, so they do not consider it evidence of a cure for gonorrhea. Originally, gonorrhea is extremely small in size and can only be seen in its original form under a high-magnification microscope, which is beyond the reach of the naked eye. Generally, after gonorrhea becomes chronic, it mostly lies dormant inside and only emerges when the body's resistance is weakened. After sexual activity, alcoholism, or strenuous labor, gonorrhea will become active, and this cycle will inevitably lead to major problems. Only when gonorrhea recurs can gonorrhea-like flakes be seen floating in the urine again, which is especially a burden for chronic gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Turn into Other Symptoms and Treat Early: However, because the gonorrhea has cleared, most people are negligent in seeking a radical cure, so they often develop various other symptoms. The most notable are gonorrheal prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, cystitis, arthritis, urethral stricture, etc., all of which are caused by this. Now, if you want to fundamentally eliminate this gonorrhea, you must thoroughly cure it. In my personal experience, only the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" can take on this important task, and the combination of German electrostatic therapy and X-ray radiotherapy can especially exert the bactericidal and anti-gonorrhea power of "Kelinong". Because the bactericidal power of "Kelinong" is truly far-reaching and meticulous. Regardless of whether the gonorrhea is superficial in the mucous membrane or deep in the inner layer of the tendons and bones, its bactericidal power is more than enough. Therefore, if you want to fundamentally and quickly solve the gonorrhea problem, you cannot achieve the true goal without this. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 numbers will be given out every day, and each number will only cost 5 cents.</p>
<h3>The Choice of Lung Medicine</h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Lingering coughs are often a precursor to lung disease. To prevent lung disease, it is imperative to quickly cure coughs. I have been a lung disease expert for nearly 20 years. Due to my extensive experience in various symptoms of lung disease, I am very confident in which medicine is the most effective. Whether it is to relieve coughs or treat various forms of tuberculosis, the German medicine "Bufei Naier" can definitely do the job happily. No matter how stubborn the cough is, taking "Bufei Naier" can relieve the cough and expel phlegm within three hours, making it easier to cough up phlegm, and it can also nourish the lungs, with effects far above ordinary lung medicines. Those who suffer from lung disease and feel that other medicines are ineffective may wish to try this product, as its effectiveness is indeed reliable.</p>

<h3>"Also Has"</h3>
<p>— Du Jin</p>
<p>"What foreign countries have, China also has." This is a sentence we often say. "What China has, foreign countries also have." This is also a sentence we often say. However, these two sentences each have their own meanings.</p>
<p>Rong Ren Gong once wrote an article saying that "Gentleman" is the most special word in English, and there is a "Junzi" in Chinese that is exactly the same, which shows that Chinese is the richest language in the world. This argument did cause a stir for a while, but in the end, no one paid attention to it. In the past, the foreign language that was popular in China was only English, and the high-level Chinese people that Mr. Liang interacted with only kept calling the word "Gentleman" in their mouths, so Mr. Liang had such a "smokescreen". This kind of invention of "what foreign countries have, China also has" is actually not clever.</p>
<p>However, this kind of not-so-clever invention can still be considered not to be rambling. Because there is indeed a word "Gentleman" in English, and it does have something to do with the "Junzi" in Chinese. The most thorough is the shouting of another faction. Kang Youwei went to Shaanxi to give a lecture and roared: Confucius also invented wireless telegraphy, and he was going to write a book to invent Confucius's invention. However, until his death, that book was never published. This time, the "what foreign countries have, China also has" resulted in only "nothing".</p>
<p>When this trend reached the last dynasty, it became even more of a scam. Now, some famous Chinese medicine practitioners in Shanghai also use stethoscopes when treating patients, and also ask patients to take quinine when treating malaria. They rarely say "sour medicine belongs to wood and enters the liver, bitter medicine belongs to fire and enters the heart" anymore, but they are still scolding Western medicine. The meaning is obvious that they attribute stethoscopes and quinine to their "ancestral" names. This method is naturally much smarter than before. They made a fortune by "what foreign countries have", and then went a step further and simply said: "What foreign countries have is actually all Chinese!" Not only is it more thorough, but it also takes advantage of it, which is really admirable.</p>
<p>But no matter what, this kind of "what foreign countries have, China also has" can actually be said to originate from a kind of competitive spirit. Although it eventually became taking advantage of it, the creator of this trend still has a place to be forgiven. The most useless is "what China has, foreign countries also have."</p>
<p>China has mahjong, and foreign countries also have poker; China has "Sanbian Wine", and foreign countries also have Curacao; China has foot binding, and foreign countries also have waist binding; China has concubines, and foreign countries also have mistresses...</p>
<p>Although the purpose is to justify oneself, those things cannot be said to be good things in foreign countries, and uselessness has naturally reached its peak. However, on the matter itself, it can still be said to be passable. Only when this trend reaches the last dynasty will it also become a scam, and the characteristic of that scam is: using foreign good things to cover up one's own useless things.</p>
<p>There was a past example. A poet who considered himself a symbolist made poems that no one could understand, so he said: "I will translate a famous foreign poem for you, and see if it is easy to understand!" The poem was really translated, and it was said to be "Nocturne parlsien" by the French poet Verlaine, which did make people's eyes turn white after reading it. But fortunately, the era was no longer that of Liang Rengong, and some people could actually read French. When the original text was read, it was discovered that the poem was originally easy to understand. In this way, the poet's secret was revealed, so the poet sadly slipped away, and it seems that there have never been any symbolic masterpieces since then.</p>
<p>There is also a current example. A group of "peace-loving" great men are "fighting for peace". Because they were scolded so badly that they had no choice, they said: "It doesn't matter if we are humiliated, don't you know that Russia once signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with foreign countries?" This is a really good analogy. "Anti-communism" is right, but the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is a treasure. However, in the end, it is probably not feasible, because there are many people who know what the situation in Russia is like and what the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk is, and in the end, they still cannot deceive people, and they can only shrink their heads and be done with it.</p>
<p>"What China has, foreign countries also have" is fundamentally inferior to "what foreign countries have, China also has". Therefore, the scam of the last dynasty not only does not take advantage of it, but also reveals its hideous face even more.</p>
<h3>A Clown in a Fascist Martial Arts Troupe: "Watch My Trick!"</h3>
<p>— Cang Qi</p>
<h3>In the Concentration Camps of Germany (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wan</p>
<p>After that, we held "Prussian-style gymnastics." The team advanced on the exercise field of Burleigh. "Lie down!" "Stand up!" The iron-like command forced every prisoner to become a docile lamb.</p>
<p>We also have game time in a day, but the so-called game is not to give us a good rest, but to tell us to stand in serious teams and learn the National Socialist morality and the action guidelines of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>At four o'clock, we all returned to the barracks for dinner: black bread and vegetables. After five o'clock, we were allowed two hours of freedom (the so-called going out, of course, was within the scope of the concentration camp). Every day, we had two hours to talk, but our conversations were very cautious. We often took a very long time to gain an understanding of the prisoners on the neighboring bed before starting to talk freely. We rarely knew the real names of the cohabiting prisoners, because the more we knew, the more trouble we would have. Many prisoners who seemed to know a lot were expelled by the guards. Where did they go? What did they do? These were all questions that we could not understand. Our spirits had been destroyed, and our whole day was immersed in constant fear and inexplicable intimidation. As a result, we were deprived of the courage to even talk.</p>
<p>"Two hours of freedom?" What to do? Cigarettes, books, and magazines were all prohibited. We could only read Hitler's "Mein Kampf" - the only coercive tool used by the Nazi authorities to promote their doctrine. In January, we only had one chance to get a military note and write a letter home under strict supervision. In January, we also only had one chance to receive a letter from outside that had been checked. On my wife's black-edged letter paper, she frantically reported that my family was using all means outside to save me from the camp. For six months, we never knew why I was declared guilty without trial; at the same time, I didn't know when my prisoner life would end.</p>
<p>An invisible pressure deprived us prisoners of our morality. There were a total of three thousand prisoners here. Although in Germany, they always maintained their pure and independent conscience. Everything that violated their conscience was the planned oppression that caused it. We were controlled by them like mutes and banished beasts. We were imprisoned there, which was the Nazis' means of destroying the spirit of those mutes or banished beasts. Texas - the death of the spirit! Our only wish was fixed on one goal: to be cautious in all our actions in order to achieve the hope of early freedom and liberation.</p>
<p>In this way, until seven o'clock, we went to bed. Ten hours of sleep was certainly not too little. In fact, the Nazis often disturbed us during this sleep time, so that we could not sleep peacefully. Every night, we were immersed in dark thoughts, whispering our expectations and fears to each other. Later, a very big rumor spread in the camp, saying that ×× had committed suicide; ××× had been assassinated; at the same time, we could be free next Saturday!</p>
<p>Many prisoners could not bear the senseless harassment, so they simply committed suicide. One prisoner secretly obtained a piece of tin from the stove and quickly used it to chop off his wrist, then quietly lay on the bed with a smile until he bled to death. Several tied knots with rags and sneaked out to a damp place, where they hanged themselves in the dark.</p>
<p>These six months of leisurely years slowly dragged on, slowly passing through the rough situation every day. This kind of life continued until I left the camp and got back on the windowless truck that took me here from Munich.</p>
<p>I was imprisoned by them without any reason or purpose, and there was still no news of the "trial." Finally, a train took me to Kopres, where I was imprisoned for another month before they took me to court.</p>
<p>The three judges selected by the state lawyer declared that my crime was treasonously violating the German people, and the old woman who came to visit my sister-in-law testified. At that time, one of the doors of the court was half open, and my wife was standing there! During the lawyer's defense time, we were given a chance to look at each other. In the silent gaze, our hearts almost broke!</p>
<p>The three judges believed that my crime should be sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The time I spent here awaiting trial was already seven months, so this four-month sentence was considered to be before my release, and I had to take an oath: I must keep secret everything I saw and heard in the concentration camp. If I violated this oath, I would be subject to imprisonment by the German Board of Reflections.</p>
<p>My wife and I went to Berlimenfu to get our American passports. After they issued them, I bid farewell to Germany forever.</p>
<p>Even now, when my wife and I hear those stories about Nazi Germany in tea rooms with friends, my heart jumps involuntarily; at the same time, to avoid being heard by others, I lower the tone of my conversation. Even now, I still don't believe that I am in a free country - the United States! (Translated from Collier's)</p>
<h3>A Great Group</h3>
<p>— Yan Peng</p>
<p>In order to save the country from disaster, in order to protect our homeland; go! Brothers, pick up our shovels! A silver-gray wilderness night. A group of black shadows, tall and short, talking, laughing, humming songs, left the quiet village and walked towards the road.</p>
<p>That endless "Hai Zheng Highway" had been neatly repaired by the enemy after the second fall of Suining. Cars came and went constantly during the day, and the smell of gasoline spread and could still be smelled at night.</p>
<p>The sky was filled with stars and the moon, casting a cold light, and the wind was blowing a sad tune on the withered trees.</p>
<p>"We're here! Yuejia Bridge."</p>
<p>The flowing water under the bridge was washing away the gravel on the edge, making a crisp sound, rustling...</p>
<p>"Come on! Brothers, let's work together to destroy this bridge!"</p>
<p>With that, a group of black shadows dispersed.</p>
<p>Tall and short, waving shovels, rising and falling, the clanging sound was very crisp, forming a great symphony!</p>
<p>"Hmm! Old Wu! Does this sound good?"</p>
<p>"Of course! It's more pleasant than the sound of bombs dropped by airplanes!"</p>
<p>"Damn it: the soldiers are having nightmares in their beds at this time!"</p>
<p>"Hey! The soldiers won't guess that we farmers did it when they find out that the bridge is broken!"</p>
<p>Talking, laughing, and excitedly waving their strong arms.</p>
<p>Stone strips and mud clods kept falling into the water, splashing up patches of broken waves, revealing glittering silver light.</p>
<p>"Crash!" Suddenly, with such a sound, a section of the bridge in the middle of the three holes collapsed completely.</p>
<p>"Hehe! It's done! Let's brothers cross the river to dig up the highway!"</p>
<p>A group of black shadows waded across the water, and soon they were waving shovels on the smooth road over there.</p>
<p>Everyone is shedding blood and sweat together, huh ha hai,</p>
<p>Resist the war,</p>
<p>Even if the frost wind blows cold to the bone! Huh ha hai</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The cheerful singing gently rippled in the silent air.</p>
<p>"Quieter! Don't be too happy, it's not fun if the devils hear us."</p>
<p>"……"</p>
<p>The moon slipped past the mid-sky, and the rustling cold wind kept blowing,</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the shovels danced more quickly...</p>
<p>"Alright! It's almost dawn!"</p>
<p>A group of great black shadows slowly moved again.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>The banquet started at noon, but it wasn't even ten o'clock yet, and the guests had arrived one after another. Everyone wanted to take this opportunity to admire the demeanor of Commander Ye. These guests, such as Lu Yaojin, the principal of Hup Elementary School, Jin Chunan, a doctor, Yang Yueliang, a map director, and Cai Hefeng, the owner of Fengmu Firm, were all well-known figures in the town who were greeted everywhere they went. Inviting them to be guests for Commander Ye was indeed not humiliating.</p>
<p>Because it was still early, the guests used conversation to pass the time. Needless to say, the topic of conversation was focused on the war. The only newspaper in the township office became a very valuable material. The newspaper was reporting the news that the soldiers had landed on Jinshanwei and attacked Songyin Mishidu, but the people present were very vague about the geographical situation and did not know where Jinshanwei was. However, there was no map in the newspaper that day, which could not help everyone understand, so everyone had to guess wildly.</p>
<p>"I guess Jinshanwei must be on the other side of Liuhe," said Yang Yueliang, the map director, affirmatively, stroking his mustache. "Otherwise, it wouldn't have such a significant impact on the military. Last time, during the January 28 Shanghai War, we had to retreat because the soldiers landed on Liuhe, didn't we?"</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not necessarily on Liuhe," said Dr. Jin Chunan tactfully. He was a well-rounded person and obviously didn't want to offend the map director in his words. "If it was on the other side of Liuhe, then the troops fighting near Shanghai should have retreated to Kunshan Qingyanggang, why are they still holding on to West Shanghai and Nanshi after retreating from Zhabei?"</p>
<p>"I think it's probably in Pudong," said Cai Hefeng, the owner of Hefeng Timber Company, who was reading the newspaper. He folded the newspaper casually, but eagerly found the words "Punan" from the news and pointed them out to everyone, saying: "Punan and Pudong must be close to each other, this is a very good proof."</p>
<p>"Punan is Punan, Pudong is Pudong, how can you confuse them," said Yang Yueliang unconvinced, his nature has always been a bit stubborn.</p>
<p>However, Cai Hefeng refused to give in and insisted on his own opinion, saying:</p>
<p>"Who knows, maybe the word "South" was originally the word "East", and the typesetter made a mistake." (II)</p>

<h3>A Mother's Farewell Amidst a Barrage of Arrows is a Patriotic Drama</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>"A Mother's Farewell Amidst a Barrage of Arrows" is two scenes from the Kunqu opera "The Iron Crown Picture." It tells the story of Zhou Yuji, a loyal minister of the late Ming Dynasty, who defends Ningwu Pass alone against insurmountable odds. As a result, his elderly mother, wife, children, and servants all sacrifice themselves. Zhou himself is killed by Li Chuang's barrage of arrows, making it a heroic and tragic play about sacrificing oneself for the country. This play has always been highly regarded and is now performed by several schools. The Kunqu opera troupe's performance is the authentic and direct transmission. The Gaoqiang opera troupe's performance is similar to Kunqu opera, except that during the farewell scene, Zhou's wife seizes Zhou's sword unexpectedly and commits suicide, which is different from the Kunqu version, where Zhou throws the sword to his wife, implying that she should kill herself. The Erhuang opera troupe also sings Kunqu opera, which originally evolved from the Kunqu opera troupe, but there are slight differences in the postures and lyrics.</p>
<p>In the Gaoqiang school, I have seen Tao Xianting often perform this play (while Han Shichang performed "The Tiger Assassin"). In the Erhuang school, I have seen Yu Shuyan perform it, reportedly taught by Yao Zenglu (who played Zhou's mother at the time). I have also seen Rui Deshi perform a segment. In the Kunqu school, I used to see Shi Chuanzhen perform several segments. Now I see Zheng Chuanjian perform it, with Chuan Ling performing the barrage of arrows. Ignoring the rest, I will now comment on Zheng's art.</p>
<p>Zheng Chuanjian, playing Zhou Yuji, sings with strength and has the play in his heart and on his face. The feelings of grief and indignation are completely expressed without any omissions. Although his voice is not smooth, he does not screech in the high notes. If he had a good voice, he would be even more outstanding. His stage movements are skillful, every hand gesture and stance is proper. During the fire-fighting scene, he even performs a backflip, which is very tense, though it seems slightly influenced by Peking opera. I recall that twenty years ago, Tao Xianting crawled forward on his knees in this section. In the barrage of arrows scene, Chuan Ling is good at transmitting the arrows. After being shot, he returns to the stage as a stiff corpse and falls backward, which is extremely solid and unprecedented. In this scene, he fights a tiger beforehand, which is quite spectacular. Although there is a hint of Peking opera in the martial arts, it must be said that there is progress. Chuan Qian also excels at transmitting the barrage of arrows in several scenes, with superb martial arts skills.</p>
<p>Besides these two acts, there were "Borrowing Military Pay," "Borrowing Tea," and "A Stroll in the Garden, Awakening from a Dream," performed jointly by Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang. However, the audience turnout was not as large as for xiaoshu (storytelling) and new dramas, proving the saying "high art finds few followers."</p>
<p>According to official history, Zhou's wife did not commit suicide but was a female hero who led several hundred female soldiers in street battles against the rebels, eventually committing suicide after exhausting her strength. In the second year of the Xuantong era, I visited Fengshan Mountain in Pi County, which is the hometown of Zhu Zhi. The mountain is not very high, but there is a Zhou Yuji temple on it. The murals depict the entire story of the resistance against the war and his martyrdom at Ningwu Pass, all based on the official history of the Ming Dynasty. There is also a painting of Madam Zhu leading female soldiers in street battles. Many residents in the villages at the foot of the mountain are surnamed Zhou, said to be descendants of Yuji. It is thought that although Yuji's immediate family died in martyrdom, other branches of his family have not died out, as the saying goes, "A loyal minister's line will not be cut off."</p>
<p>This play is an excellent patriotic drama, of great significance for the independence of the Chinese nation, shining brightly throughout the ages, comparable to the sun and moon. It should be vigorously promoted in all sectors of society. I once studied the music of this play with Jin Jun and a certain musician in Tianjin (introduced by Tong Manqiu from the south), but I have never performed it, mainly because I was afraid of the difficulty. I heard that the Red Bean Villa owner learned this play from Tan Xinpei himself, and I intend to verify this.</p>
<h3>Artistic Tastes</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>For a time, Han Langan was even crowned with the nickname "Eastern Laurel," which made Little Monkey feel delighted. Therefore, Little Monkey, hoping that his acting would closely resemble Laurel's, spent a lot of money to specifically study Laurel's movements. As a result, there are many places in his performance style that are learned from Laurel. However, although this is imitation, it also shows Little Monkey's dedication to art. Before Little Monkey appeared on the screen, his nickname was "Little Trembler." In the Ximeng Road area of ​​Ma Lang Road, he could often be seen lying across the road kicking a small leather ball, always trying to take advantage of women. Now that he is famous in the film industry, he may not need to put on airs, but he must have a presence. He rides his motorcycle back and forth every day, making a "put put put" sound, which is indeed a bit imposing.</p>
<p>Although Film Queen Hu Die is not as delicate as the young girls, her beauty is still as good as ever. Her appearance is elegant and luxurious, but in reality, she is very stingy. She does not have the extravagant habits of other actresses, but is full of deep storage. Saving is her natural ability: often thirty copper coins are exchanged for a dime; ten dimes are exchanged for a dollar; accumulating five one-dollar bills becomes five dollars; collecting two five-dollar bills becomes ten dollars; and so on, from hundreds to thousands, from thousands to tens of thousands. Other actresses are panicked every day, but she is the opposite. If someone asks her, she will tell you "Raise children to prevent old age, store grain to prevent famine." These two old sayings.</p>
<p>Old-timer Huang Junfu, a big guy, is also the small boss of a pork shop in Fahua Town, Xuhui. He always raises seven or eight sows at home, hoping that they will eat, sleep, and become fat. Who knew that things would gather according to type, and the thin Huang Junfu actually became as fat as a pig. Huang's expression is dull and rigid, which is not pleasing to the director, but he can rely on his fatness to fill a role and regulate the atmosphere. Later, because he indulged in gambling, he became confused and lost everything. He went from being a boss to a pauper, and his body became as thin as a snowman under the sun. I advise fat Huang to turn back, as the shore is within sight.</p>
<p>"Nominal Husband and Wife" is Ruan Lingyu's debut work. From that film, you can see Wang Xianzai's elegant and suave appearance in his youth. Because of his inherently sinister face, his role in the film is to play villains and be an unpleasant person. In reality, however, his conduct is truly "Amitabha," a very good gentleman who must bow and greet everyone. He lives in Mingle Lane on Foch Road and is obsessed with radio. His house is filled with several large and small radios, and the sound of Suzhou storytelling fills his bedroom all day long.</p>
<p>Poet-director Sun Yu is a graduate of Nankai University who does not like to talk and looks at people with calm eyes all day long. He loves ideals, and the materials in the films he directs are his only reminders of his ideals. He also loves carnality, such as the fat legs of women that are the most common embellishments in "Little Toys," "Sports Queen," and "Go to Nature." What does this mean? His answer is "Because the audience below the stage has the same taste as me!" Wonderful!</p>
<h3>Another Round of Kowtowing in the Opera World</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>"Adoptive Father" and "Teacher" in Harmony, "Tianjin" and "Shanghai" Rejoice Together</p>
<p>My friend Chen Chanweng wrote an article titled "A Sound of Apprenticeship in Tianjin" twenty years ago, published in the entertainment section of this newspaper, recording important news in the opera world. This article describes things that Chanweng did not know about, and I am eager to select them and turn them into an article, published in this section, also with the intention of supplementing historical records.</p>
<p>Newcomer Kunqu actress Tong Zhiling is the daughter of Tong Hanxia, a famous figure in the Tianjin education circle. She is intelligent, talented, and obsessed with opera. When she was very young, she began learning opera from a certain actor, diligently and tirelessly studying without complaint. Immersed for several years, her progress was rapid, and now she has emerged. My friend Sha Dafeng is a talented figure in the Pingju opera world and has a reputation in Tianjin. Seeing that Zhiling's talent and art are both excellent, he believes she is promising, and his articles of praise are seen in newspapers in Tianjin. Zhiling's father, grateful for Sha's encouragement, specially asked someone to act as an intermediary, intending to have his daughter become Sha's apprentice. Sha has a lot of contact with people in the opera world and appreciates Zhiling. Now that Zhiling is willing to become an adopted daughter, he is naturally happy to agree. Zhiling heard that Sha had not refused, and was overjoyed. On the 14th of last month, she personally went to the Tianfeng Newspaper Office to hold an adoption ceremony. The ceremony was very grand, with over sixty guests including celebrities such as Wang Bolong, Jin Laoguan, Liu Yunruo, and prominent figures from all walks of life in Tianjin. It was a grand occasion, and the atmosphere was especially pleasant and enthusiastic, with toasts and mutual encouragement.</p>
<p>Kunqu actress Jin Youqin (the name "Youqin" reported in a certain newspaper was wrong) was recognized by Jin Shaobao Xihou, and her reputation was shaken. Recently, under the leadership of Shaobao, Youqin went to Tianjin to become an apprentice of Wang Yaoqing, a famous Dan actor, to seek further studies. Yaoqing received Shaobao's letter and immediately agreed, and chose the 14th to hold the apprenticeship ceremony in his home at Dama Temple. Youqin's art is not weak, and in the future, with the personal guidance of the old actor Wang, her achievements will be limitless.</p>
<p>Boy actor Du Fuchu, the younger brother of famous Kunqu actress Du Liyun, came to Shanghai from Tianjin in early summer. Because of his admiration for Mr. Su Shaoqing, he specially asked someone to introduce him, requesting to become his student. Seeing that Youchu was intelligent, Mr. Su accepted him and taught him six Tan school operas, including "Empty City Stratagem," "Fish Intestine Sword," "Eight Righteous Figures," "Hongyang Cave," "Drumming and Scolding Cao," and "Qin Qiong Sells His Horse," as a greeting gift. Recently, Youchu also became the adopted son of Luo Quyuana, a famous amateur performer. On the day of the ceremony, Luo said to Youchu with a smile: "Teacher Su has taught you six plays. As your adoptive father, I should at least double that. Now, I will teach you "The Precious Lotus Lantern." After "The Precious Lotus Lantern" is completed, I will continue to teach you "Sitting in the Building and Killing the Daughter-in-Law," "Emerald Screen Mountain," and "The Upright Official's Booklet," what do you think?" Youchu was shocked and returned to tell his sister: "With these two 'teachers' and one 'father,' how can I not become a famous actor?" Liyun said: "Do your best and never let down the cultivation of these two adults."</p>
<p>Sha Dafeng wrote from Tianjin, saying that Zheng Bingru, a newly famous Kunqu actress in Tianjin, has excellent talent and art and is worth cultivating. If I could take her as an adopted daughter, Dafeng would be very willing to act as Cao Qiu. I replied expressing my agreement. There has never been anyone with the surname Zheng in the opera world. Now Bingru is like a rare flower emerging. It is the supreme glory of our Rongyang clan. If Bingru does not dislike my old age and is willing to call me adoptive father, I would be seeking it and not be able to get it, so how could I pretend to be polite and reject her from thousands of miles away? This letter has been sent for seven days. It is expected that on the day this manuscript is published, it will be the time when this letter reaches Dafeng. Upon seeing the letter, Dafeng will definitely tell Bingru immediately, so the time when this manuscript is published will also be the time when Bingru calls me adoptive father. Thinking of this, how can my heart not bloom with joy!</p>
<h3>Opera World News Roundup</h3>
<p>After Gu Wuwu invited Lin Shusen's troupe, he is still looking for other actors. He has entrusted the Actors Association to handle everything. Gu originally planned to return to Hong Kong first, but now he will travel to Hong Kong with Lin Shusen and others on the Russian Queen on the 7th. Gu has also appointed Zhu Baoru as the representative to go north. They will be setting sail soon. Currently, Gu is in contact with the Tianjin Chinese Grand Theater, exchanging letters and telegrams, and the two sides are very close, and there is a good chance of success.</p>
<p>The Gongwu Stage has decided that the day shows will run until the 18th starting from New Year's Day of Jimao. After that, movies will be shown from Monday to Friday every week. The stage's martial arts actor Wang Fuying resigned from the troupe, but the authorities announced that he would remain in his original position, and his request was not approved.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, the pillar of the Xinji Grand Stage, has recently expressed his intention to retire. After repeated persuasion and retention by backstage personnel and his friends, Zhang has abandoned his prejudice and will definitely continue to work there next spring.</p>
<p>Since the Red Star Theater began showing dramas, it has suffered huge losses and cannot maintain itself, so it announced its suspension of performances yesterday. It is reported that the authorities of the Queen will negotiate with Wang Yigong and Dong Tianmin, the persons in charge of the Red Star, based on the contract.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Child Amateur Performer Hu Guorong</h3>
<p>— Ruoqi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Fund-Raising Amateur Performer Group for Refugees was on its fourth day, January 30th. Those who appeared on stage in the night show at the Golden Grand Theater were all child amateurs. Among them was the young Hu Guorong, who is only eleven years old. He played Shi Yi Lang in "White Water Beach." His makeup was handsome; his actions were skilled; and his singing was powerful from beginning to end. At such a young age, he was impeccable. During his spare time, he learns Peking opera, possessing all these talents. He is truly rare in the amateur world. His father is Mr. Hu Fangming, a comprador of the French Municipal Council. Considering the good deed, he ordered his son to participate, showing enthusiasm for public welfare, which is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Spoken drama in China in its early days was imported from the West and began in schools run by Westerners. Ten years before the founding of the Republic of China, that is, in the eleventh month of the winter of the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu (1902), the Shanghai Christian Hanzhu Academy created and performed spoken dramas, and the Xuhui Public School followed suit; however, the stories performed were European and Western stories, spoken in English and French. Only those who were familiar with Europeanized writing could understand.</p>
<p>In the twelfth month of the winter of Gengzi, the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu (1903), the Shanghai Puyang Public School performed a spoken drama. At that time, it happened to be the Boxer Rebellion, and the plays "Six Gentlemen" and "Boxers" were performed in the classroom for trial performances. The audience was students from Nanyang and Minli Teachers College - this was the first time that spoken drama in China evolved from Europeanization to being sung in "Beijing dialect." In the seventh month of the autumn of the following year, Jia Chen, Nanyang Public School and Minli Middle School also performed spoken dramas. Then, Minli students took the lead in contacting teachers and students from various schools to create the Wenyou Society to study spoken drama.</p>
<p>In the twelfth month of the winter of Jiyou, the first year of Xuantong (1909), students from the Suzhou Gospel Hospital contacted the Jinhua Troupe to perform plays in Shanghai to help with disaster relief. They rehearsed "The Bloody Handprint." The hospital director, Mr. Yang Mou, played Han Lexi, the leader of the big class. When it came to the scene where the leader was assassinated, Chen Deyao, who played the assassin, actually killed him. Later, Chen was convicted of murder in a play and sentenced to life imprisonment, and died in prison not long after. - This is a strange case in the history of the Chinese spoken drama world.</p>
<p>In the fifth month of the summer of the first year of the Republic of China (1912), the Women's Suffrage Association performed plays in Zhang Garden, including "Female Lawyer" and "Women's World Clock," with the intention of promoting the revolution - this was the beginning of Chinese women's spoken drama.</p>
<h3>"Algiers" — Produced by United Artists</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Starring Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamarr.</p>
<p>The filmmaking style of Hollywood entered another stage in the spring of 1938. This change, in general, was a shift from light-hearted musical comedies to more serious social and cultural dramas with depth. The film "Algiers" can be said to be a pioneering blockbuster after the change in style. The film tells the story of the tense and romantic life of Pepe le Moko, a notorious gang leader in the Casbah. The police have tried every possible way to arrest him, but the results have always been failures. The streets of the Casbah are narrow, and the residents are very complex. The director made great efforts to portray the special atmosphere and complex social background of that place. The strong local color added a lot of strength. The female lead in the film is played by Hedy Lamarr, the sensual star known for her performance in "Ecstasy." In this film, she makes even greater artistic sacrifices than before. The film was also produced by famous Chinese cinematographer Huang Zongzhan. Huang's unique art, that elusive magic, will be displayed in the film.</p>

<h3>Li Amao and the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Xiao Fan</p>
<p>The comedian Xu Zhuodai, nicknamed Dr. Li Amao, has had a long history with the entertainment world. He studied physical education in Japan, but after returning to China, he did not work in the sports world for long. He had the longest contact with the entertainment world and has not broken away from it to this day.</p>
<p>He was a pioneer in the spoken drama world, which was then called civilization drama, along with Zheng Zhengqiu. His stage name was Xu Banmei, specializing in playing clowns to provide audiences with laughter. At that time, even if a play was a tragedy, there was often a joke inserted in the middle to allow the audience to change their taste and break the monotony. Now, not to mention that there are no such talents in the spoken drama world, how many famous clowns are there in the Peking opera world? He is the most suitable person to know about the history of spoken drama.</p>
<p>Although he has not put in hard work in Peking opera, he and Xia Yueyu and others have created a serial drama combining film and Peking opera, which has become a style with another kind of interest. Now that he is over fifty years old, if he tightens his throat and hums a few lines of singing from "That Day, I Dressed Up and Looked in the Mirror," people next door would think it was a sixteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p>He not only personally dedicated himself to the silver screen but also jointly founded the "Happy Company" film company with Wang Youyou, specializing in filming comedies. After the Happy Company closed, he sometimes worked as an actor, sometimes as a director, and sometimes as a screenwriter. Able to act, direct, and write, he truly deserves to be called the "Oriental Chaplin." Recently, he still often writes movie scripts and serves as a lecturer at the "Star Training Institute."</p>
<p>While engaged in the entertainment world, he has never stopped writing. His style always cannot escape being comical, humorous, and interesting. The name of the comedian came from when he wrote comical novels. Li Amao was the protagonist in one of his novels. Later, he used this name to create a mailbox, answering readers' questions in a comical tone. The name Li Amao became famous, even more so than Xu Zhuodai. As for his name when he was studying - Xu Chuanlin, even fewer people know about it.</p>
<p>After the National Army withdrew to the West, he also edited the weekly "Instant Karma," still consistently using the same comical style as before, but using a Shanghai term for "flirting." There is also an "Entertainment" column in "Instant Karma," specializing in publishing news about the entertainment world, often providing correct criticism and correction to the current entertainment world. Recently, he has also published two scales of New Year's games, "Li Amao's Shanghai Adventure" and "Tofu Beauty's Escape Map," which are extremely comical and are the only wonderful products in the Lunar New Year. - Li Amao is a strange thing that has never been separated from the entertainment world.</p>
<h3>MGM Urges Chen Yunshang to Go to America</h3>
<p>Yunshang Will Set Off After Filming</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang, a rising star who came to Shanghai from the South China Society, although her works have not yet met with everyone, movie fans already have a deep impression of her in their minds. Her Shanghai debut "Mulan Joins the Army" will be shown on New Year's Day in Jimao in Hong Kong Central and Shanghai Huguang. Needless to say, there will be a sensation. The advertisement film of Mulan Joins the Army has been brought to Hong Kong by Zhang Weitao, entrusted by Zhang Shankun of Xinhua, the day before yesterday. But recently, the American MGM film company sent a telegram urging her to leave for America immediately, as there is a film that she will star in. However, Yunshang has to finish filming "Yunshang Fairy" for Xinhua before she can set off.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City Opera World (93)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yu Zhenting Should Play Tyrants and Local Bullies</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have been competing to publish the news of the death of Xiaomaobao Yu Zhenting. Indeed, his skills were worthy of mention. Jusheng had five sons and three daughters. The eldest son entered the bureaucracy and died early. Although Zhenting was Jusheng's adopted son, the opera world called him Yu Wu, probably in order after his three older sisters. His third brother died young, his fourth brother Zanting, and his fifth brother Huating, all learned martial arts. Because Jusheng loved his youngest son the most, he wanted to pass on all his unique skills to Huating. However, Huating was young and did not work hard to practice, so in the end he did not get anything, which is a pity. Zhenting first entered the Fushou Opera School as an apprentice, studying the beard-and-gown role, but soon changed to studying martial arts. Because of his impatient nature, like his father, everyone called him Xiaomaobao. Judging from his performance, he was not suitable for long-gown plays. Short-gown plays like "Lotus Temple," "Golden Leopard," and "White Water Beach" were probably better than Xiaolou and Heyu. His most skillful and suitable play for his character was "Yan Yang Lou." When he went to Gaodeng, he was different from others as soon as he appeared on stage. His makeup was good, and his poses, style, and stature were all fashionable and beautiful. Later in the fighting scenes, Zhenting's skills were quick and agile, spinning like a whirlwind. Anyone who played against him could not keep up with his speed. In fact, these supporting actors, such as Fan Shiting, Chi Yeting, and Xu Deyi, were all well-known figures in the martial arts world. Especially the martial arts performer Xu Deyi was the eldest son of the famous Kui school Laosheng Xu Yintang. Counting out old Qian Jinfu, he was also considered the first person in martial arts. Although his hands were fast, he was still slightly inferior to Zhenting. This shows the true skill of the Yu family. Old Yu knew that his son was good at portraying tyrants and local bullies, so he passed on the long-gown plays such as "Changbanpo," "Siping Mountain," "Hunyuanhe," and "Picking Huache" to Xiaolou and Heyu as much as possible, without hiding anything. Once, Zhenting strongly requested his father to perform "Lianhuan Tao." Old Yu stopped him, saying that this play was not his forte and would damage his reputation if performed. This is truly the saying "No one knows his son like his father." Old Yu was upright, honest, and selfless. He was truly rare in the ancient and modern opera world. Now that Zhenting is dead, it is said that many people went to pay their respects. I am afraid that many people will miss Old Yu's old kindness, and therefore have a feeling of loving the house and its crow. Among the existing martial arts performers in Peiping, there is Sun Yukun (also known as Little Zhenting) who can pass on the learning of both Yu and Yang. I hope that he can revive himself and come south to show his skills, which would be much better than Zhou Yitui (Ruian) and others.</p>
