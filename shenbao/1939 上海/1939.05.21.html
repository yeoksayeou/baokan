<p>社評</p>
<h3>鼓浪嶼事件與上海問題</h3>
<p>在上海問題逐步緊張的時候，鼓浪嶼先發生了日軍登陸事件；及至鼓浪嶼形勢趨於明朗，上海空氣亦隨之而見得緩和。兩地微妙的和諧，全世界輿論為之擊節贊歎。這是英法美三國計劃的一致行動所致，治療得法，所以着手成春。</p>
<p>綜合各國報紙對於鼓浪嶼與上海問題的論斷，大多認為鼓浪嶼事件簡直為了上海問題纔發生的；鼓浪嶼事件的本身沒有多大意義，在日本祗是試探，在英法美祗是演習，問題的對象却是上海。原來英法美對於遠東糾紛，態度漸歸一致，相的共同對付；由一致的隱忍，轉變為一致的强硬；由平行的交涉，轉變為聯合的行動。這種內情，在英法美三國當局，從未作何正式表示，更遑論露骨的宣傳；但是蛛絲馬跡所示，由隱的透露而成為公開的秘密，日本方面豈無所聞。惜乎數年以來，國際行動之以英國為中心者，每每予人以極大的誤會；即凡百英國之所謂決心，以其行動之緩慢陰柔，而使人致疑於其決心之僅是虛聲。若果決心，必人人知所顧忌；若僅虛聲，則人人得而侮之。以日本慾念的昂進，當然不為虛聲所動；鑒於英法美諸國與上海的利害深切，亦恐未必甘於隱忍斷送；於是乎試探之於鼓浪嶼。而英法美因此對於一致强硬，聯合行動，亦作初决演習。若近日上海兩租界的會銜吿示，以及演習戒嚴，與有同樣意味，祗是具體而微罷了。</p>
<p>英法美在鼓浪嶼所表演的：先之以平行的抗議，繼之以三國海軍陸戰隊的聯合登陸。現在三國海軍登陸的人數，各對日本保持等數的關係；於是三國相加，就三倍於日軍；這樣，在數量方面確實表示了保持絕對優勢的決心。這種決心的表示，豈為了彈丸之地的鼓浪嶼？老實說；如果上海沒有到了一個嚴重的階段，三國對鼓浪嶼事件，還不會放棄妥協的態度；三國放棄妥協而具決心，實是日本所促成。東京日外務省發言人說：「去年日本陸戰隊曾在鼓浪嶼巡邏歷兩月之久，各國對之並未提出任何交涉或抗議，而外國軍艦亦未派水兵登陸」。這幾句話在日方好像是責備三國的行動過當，其實却是三國態度趨於積極，而鼓浪嶼事件與上海問題聯繫性最好的說明。</p>
<p>鼓浪嶼形勢旣趨於明朗了，再檢討上海風雲：自從五月三日，日本政府向英美兩國提出了關於上海公共租界的備忘錄以後，幾月來忽張忽弛的局面，又重新到達了十分嚴重的階段。每一個上海市民都感到岌岌不可終日的形勢，以為不知將變化到怎樣的地步。然而就在這時候英美政府正密切保持聯絡，準備聯合答覆日本的要求；租界的當局却竭力使用的束的方法，禁止界內居民的一切政治活動，企圖緩和空氣，减少日方的藉口機曾。這樣經過了相當的時間，各方的準備略己成就，於是五月十七日，即英美法三國海軍聯合在鼓浪嶼上岸的同一天，美國政府即首先發動，正式照會日本，拒絕關於上海公共租界的一切要求，並且反要求日本，把蘇州河以北的區域交還工部局管理。十九日，英國政府也把與美國同樣態度的覆牒送致日方，並鄭重聲明英美兩國在鼓浪嶼及上海問題上，都取着完全的合作。這樣，半個月來上海陰鬱沉悶的氣候，忽然有春雲乍展之觀。</p>
<p>上海問題的開展，不僅對於上海本身具有轉危為安的作用；就是整個的遠東形勢上，也從此透露了光明。英美法在上海或鼓浪嶼的聯合行動，可以說是遠東集體安全組織的雛型。日本因對華軍事漸趨不利，正轉而企圖鞏固佔領區內的勢力，加緊排斥歐美的在華利益，現在忽然碰到了英美法堅强一致的聯合抵抗，必然會感到更深的艱窘。</p>
<p>世界與情，擊節贊歎，是苦悶的反動；按之遠無法大局的實際演變還不夠遽加贊歎。第一，禍源在於侵略的願望，至止前為止，侵略願望一遏於中國的抗戰，再遏於英法美的轉趨強硬，使願望自此有其限度；然而尙不足以使之幡然改圖，故禍源依然存在。第二，卽以鼓浪嶼為例，英法美雖已使之危而復安，但是性質上屬於事後的消毒工作；如當時的欺凌外僑，逮捕華人，仍無所補救；以此推論鼓浪嶼以外的任何他處，即使處處亡羊補牢，已經創痕斑斑了；故非急起直追，嚴格相繩，作有效的預防，有效的膺懲，將見處處仍有亡羊之痛。第三，即以上海而論，租界工部局在界內行使全部管理勸，當然為我們所絕對擁護，但遠東問題一日不解決，則上海根基一日不穩定；求解決，求穩定，有待英法美三國進一步的積極。上海需要內部安寗，尤需要四海昇平！</p>

<h3>兩租界恢復常態　撤除緊急戒備　收效良好足徵警力充沛　戒備時期內未發生盜刦</h3>
<p>本市公共租界當局、於前日深晚起突然實施緊急戒備、以迅速之行動、佈置鐵絲網、封鎖兩租界交界處之非必要各馬路及里弄交通、同時英美駐滬防軍暨白俄團丁、及各捕房中西警務人員、均一律出動、梭巡各路、並檢查行人、法租界方面、亦動員全體警務人員在界內搜查各商店居戶、同時並由法國駐軍當局派水兵二百名、至土出灣天主堂區增防、其緊張情勢、爲去年八一三滬戰紀念後所僅見、致一般市民推測紛紜、羣相驚惶、但自昨晨起、兩租界所採取之緊急戒備、業已迅速撤除、英美法防軍　萬國商團、均已復員、各處交通、亦恢復平時狀態、查租界當局此决採取緊急戒備、係表示其保衛租界秩序與安寗之決心、目對企圖擾亂租界之任何政治活動、含有嚴重之警告性、同時更爲遇必要時實行警戒之一種試騐、中外市民、對當局維護公共秩序之決心、與迅速動員之良好成績、咸一致表示深切之欽佩、</p>
<p>大陸報云</p>
<p>兩租界遍境突取戒備歷二十四小時後、於今（二十日）晨十二時三十分、巡捕奉令撤除障礙物、美陸戰隊與英兵巡邏隊同時撤退、萬國商團與公共租界特別巡捕隊亦接令復員、當局取此異常步骤、全市遍起謠諑、但無一獲得證實者、昨日</p>
<p>安然而過</p>
<p>並無任何意外事件、外傳槍械與軍火自浦東取道法租界而入公共租界之說、亦爲昨日公共租界軍警聯合取此嚴峻行動的原因之一、截至昨日深夜爲止、未起不幸事件、亦未抄獲槍械、雖有可疑份子的百人被帶入各捕房鞠訊、僅加　留、但未有被逮捕者、據向可靠方面探悉、昨日之</p>
<p>軍警戒備</p>
<p>非僅「練習的戒備」而已、近數月來罪案激增、尤以暴行爲多、持械匪黨日增、持械刦案頻繁、而入此輩暴徒手中之手槍與手溜彈、似亦日見其多、警務當局傳聞槍械潛運入公共租界、決計遏止罪行活動、並不先事警告、即於昨晨實行</p>
<p>嚴峻步驟</p>
<p>當局計劃此戒備、已歷數日、但嚴守秘密、甚至警務處巡捕亦於星期四日晚接令出動始行得悉、自星期四日午夜至今日侵晨、絕未聞持械行刦案觀於前數週內、日有持械行刦案三四起、則昨日之警力表演、固有若干良好效果也、法租界進行搜查、並未抄獲槍械、亦無被逮者、雖有可疑份子被扣鞠訊、但不久即行開釋、</p>
<h3>四報停刊事同業關懷　深望早日復刊</h3>
<p>本市新聞界同人、對於文滙報·譯報·大美報·中美日報·等四報之遭受處分、表示其深切之關懷與同情、並盼四報能早日獲得諒解、恢復出版與發行、字林報云、今日（廿日）侵晨發電話至美商大美報編輯部探詢、據該部某華員答稱、當然、吾人刻在工作中、大美報今日將照常出版、雖不知能吾銷售、但今日、明日與他日、吾人將照常工作云、同時、咋日整日與今晨、該報館入口處附近、駐有大批法租界巡捕、並有華捕一名、駐守</p>
<p>天主堂街</p>
<p>入印刷所之門口、注視離印刷所之人、並檢查自所携出之句裏與報紙、使昨日之大美報確無携出、該報與中美日報暨英商譯報及文滙報之登記證、於星期日午後經工部局與英大使館分別吊銷、其他三報、昨雖停止印行、大美報照常出版、然昨日淸晨被</p>
<p>阻止銷售</p>
<p>、大批法租界巡捕包圍該館四週、阻止報販取報、昨日深晚、譯報與文滙報互有接觸、聞兩報發行人仍將停止出版、以待可望於此後數日內抵滬之駐華英大使來埠、俾能直接商諸英大使、而使禁令撤銷、中美日報之編輯部與印刷部已關閉、該報發行人顯已決待</p>
<p>此後發展</p>
<p>、記者昨以關於禁止期限事、叩諸工部局某高級人員、渠未有所言、但衆信就美商二報而言、至六月一日將准其重行登記、英商兩報、或將於同日獲得許可、而向領事署重行登記、但此事昨日未能獲得證實、昨日英文大美晚報前頁</p>
<p>刊有社評</p>
<p>、轉載發行人及編輯致美國總領事之函件、對所受待遇、作强硬之反抗、並堅請立即要求駐滬法總領事、立即並永久停止法公董局或法領事署對付該報之一切活動、且要求賠償因「破壞美商權利」、而使發行人所受之一切損失</p>
<p>法報紀載</p>
<p>據廿日法文上每日報載、聞大美報之執照、自被公共租界工部局吊銷後、該報仍然出版、事爲法捕房所悉、乃在該報之犬主堂街印刷所前守候、</p>
<p>不許其發售、當時幷經沒收有十六份之大美報，事後、該報當局即往美領事署、要求對法方提出抗議、惟查此事法捕房係爲與公共租界工部局之合作行爲、則以該報執照、旣被吊銷、自不能在兩租界內發售、聞自公共租界及法租界當局、發有聯銜告示以後、此後在維持治安上、一切均當採取合作態度、</p>
<h3>鮮猪業要求法當局協助疏通來源　全巿肉業昨晨忍痛復業　販客購豬來滬要求保障</h3>

<p>昨晨復業開始門售</p>
<p>鮮猪業於十九日起復業、先儘存猪秤售後、法租界宰牲處、及公共租界蘇錫宰牲公司、新寗海宰牲公司、於前晚起開始恢復宰猪、昨晨起文全市二千餘家鮮肉店及肉攤發售、以前被迫停業之各肉攤、昨晨已一律復業、市塲肉價已趨穩定、同業拆價每元二斤、門市腿肉每元一斤八兩、五花每元一斤十兩、</p>
<p>陳述經過要求協助</p>
<p>鮮猪業同業公會、於昨晨再派員向法公董局陳述接受勸告忍痛復業之經過、並要求協助設法疏通來源、以維滬市租界內之肉食、聞連日由江北新港、裝日德意三國之商輪運抵上海之豬、爲數有限、不足供給當日之需、現販客方面、已竭力設法疏通來源、惟耍求租界當局予以保障、以免無故被扣、遭受損失、</p>
<h3>和平紀念塔保持莊嚴　改良崗警辦法　先試行三個月</h3>
<p>參加歐戰人士聯合會、曾向工部局指摘外灘歐戰和平紀念塔之情况、幷言若事屬需要、似可圍以有柵鬥之欄杆、俾得保持該塔之莊嚴、經該局將該處之崗警辦法改良、並由工務處担承維持該塔之整潔工作、因建造欄杆並裝柵門、的需一千五百元、本年度之預算案內、並未列有此款、該聯合會現致該局函、對上文所述措施、表示謝悃、而該局董事亦有謂建設欄杆與柵門之舉、未必無損於該塔之觀瞻者、該局因此決定、將上述辦法繼續試行三個月、屆時若無成續可言、當再考慮是吾建造攔杆及柵門、</p>
<h3>日方保護下之賭窟　竟擴張至租界　新設者計有三處之多　其他各路約有二十所　——西區罪惡漸蔓延於租界——</h3>
<p>密勒氏評論報云、極司非爾區「歹土」中日方保護下之賭窟、近數週內、開始擴張入公共租界、新設之賭窟、計有三所、其二在海格路、其一即戈登路六十五號之亞細亞俱樂部、海格路三六八號附近之賭窟、係開設「好萊塢樂園一之華人所經營、另一所在海格路億定盤路轉角、殆係獨立性質、此外極司非而路·康腦脫路·白利南路·福開森路與極司非而村中</p>
<p>亦有賭窟</p>
<p>約二十所、完全在公共租界內戈登路之新賭窟、聞獲利最厚、有達一夕四萬金之多者、此等賭窟、均屬華人經營、彼等與日軍特務部有密切聯絡、而得其保護、戈登路與海格路二賭窟、爲好萊塢樂園股東、</p>
<p>粵人王某</p>
<p>經營、海格路億定盤路轉角乏賭窟、係李某所設、經理劉某、聞係韓人或臺人、保證保護此等賭窟之日軍特務部、設辦事處於極司非而路凱納路轉角附近、主持日人名籐野、戈登路賭窟中、有司出納之日人一名、其獲利之半數、須交付日方、其他賭窟向日軍特務部、</p>
<p>繳保護費</p>
<p>則未可知、日方不僅保證經營賭窟之華人、不遭公共租界警務人員千涉、聞且保證賭徒於脊禁後返寓、不遭拘捕或干涉、自日軍侵佔上海區後、隨以俱來之罪惡、非僅賭窟一端而已、字林報曾刋有土行三十四所之名稱、均設於公共租界與法租界</p>
<p>轄區以外</p>
<p>聞此等土行均向日軍特務部領有執照、每月繳費六百元、上週內復有土行四所開設、極司非而區中此等罪惡之發展、及其蔓延入公共租界、對於租界中當然有不良之影響、</p>

<h3>虹口區火患頻頻　人犯多名被捕　日方稱係縱火團所爲　團長及團員若干被捕</h3>
<p>字林報云、日方昨日（十九日）招待各報記者時宜露、華人縱火隊、曾在虹口與楊樹浦縱火許多决、包括三月二十四日日本郵船會社倉庫與日本領事署警察總部之大火在內者、其領袖已被日軍當局捕獲、五月九日在楊樹浦放火焚燒上海棉織公司倉庫之另一縱火者、亦已就逮、據日軍發言人稱、</p>
<p>放火燃燒</p>
<p>日郵會社倉庫之縱火隊領袖、係五月八日被逮、已確定其人姓陳名興林（譯音）、年三十九、爲英笑烟公司楊樹浦工廠所僱用、寓居北江西路、發言人續稱、該縱火隊所放火焚燒者、除日郵會社倉庫外、會於去年十二月二十二日在日郵會社之滙山碼頭放火、並於三月二十六日在閘北縱火、惟該决起火、未有任何毀壞、即行撲滅、五月九日在上海棉織公司工廠縱火者、</p>
<p>亦已捕獲</p>
<p>其人姓黃名根寳、（譯音）、年二十四、受僱於該工廠中、渠已招認在其被僱工廠內縱火、陳亦已招認與日郵會社倉庫起火案有關、關於此决起火案、並已捕獲其他同謀犯云、發言人答覆某記者問話云、陳係在乍浦路橋被捕、據信渠並未參加放火行動、而係指使其他四人行事、黃係在閘北離起火地時被捕、已承認放火燒該棉織廠、陳所率領之縱火隊、有</p>
<p>政治聯絡</p>
<p>惟黃乃在丹陽路某茶館、由某人供給化學物品、並允予鉅款、該指使者尚未捕獲云、</p>
<p>又據社聞社云、虹口及滬東區內之房屋在過去之一月中、迭遭火患、其大焉者、如四月下旬日郵船會社之第二倉庫、嗣後則火患幾無日無之、有一日中竟先後達九决之多、旋日方會因之詳細調查、認火塲中常發現有放火機具、因此後決定爲</p>
<p>放火團體</p>
<p>有組織之行動、最近日方更進一步偵查、並稱已獲得若干之嫌疑者、迨至昨日日文報紙乃披露此項事件之始末、並稱該項從火團係於去年十二月組織、團員共十叫人、以英美烟草公司工人沈順林爲團長、第一次放火之對象、即爲焚燒郵船會社倉庫、此項計劃之開始、係在去年十二月二十一日、當時實行者、</p>
<p>計有團員</p>
<p>陳明康等五人、化裝苦力、潛入完成任務、三月二十四日、再由沈順林親率數團員於下午三時，携帶引火物件、混入虹口、實行縱火、迨至四月二十日、該團又分兩隊向楊樹浦及北虬江路實行放火、前者未得如願、後者則團員陳明康等二人爲憲兵隊所執、終於五月八日</p>
<p>詂沈逮捕</p>
<p>惟至翌日五月九日、楊樹浦上海紡織廠又被火焚、經憲兵捕得該廠工人王根寳（二十四歲）一人、日報並謂王係於是日將引火藥物秘密帶人廠內、而被捕者云云、此項消息、昨日日文報紙均以顯著地位刊載、足見日方對於虹口區之火患頻頻、股重注視之一斑、</p>

<p>屢施虐待</p>

<h3>協大祥挖頂房屋　控訴業主偉約　延不交屋請求賠償損失　業主對房客提三審上訴</h3>
<p>協大祥綢緞洋貨店、係南滙人孫照明獨資創設、於法租界小東門大街、自八一三抗戰發生後、因南市淪陷、該店乃分設支店於法大馬路八仙橋口、及大世界大門南首兩處、因販賣某貨獲利頗厚、致大世界之支店、於上月間兩决被人</p>
<p>投擲炸彈</p>
<p>各情已誌報端、而該店主孫照明、擬冉設分店、以推廣營業、爰於上年七月間由孫照明以同和公司法定代理人名義、向成業房地產公司主人朱雪儈、（住亨利路亨利坊二號）挖租法租界愷自邇路一四九號等門牌之房屋數幢、以開設協大祥第四支店、雙方訂立合同租的、</p>
<p>交付頂費</p>
<p>八千五百元、及押租二千元、的定在同年十月底交屋、倘房主如逾期不能交屋者、對所收頂費等加倍賠償損失、乃房主朱雪僧、於此非常時期、孤島人滿之際、竟利欲薰心、不顧道德、於簽訂此項契的後、因限期交屋關係、即以房屋年久必須重行翻造爲由、通知各房客　讓、以　如期</p>
<p>收回房屋</p>

<h3>怎樣做一個科學的孩子</h3>
<p>— 66兒童科學研究社社員李桂芳</p>
<p>世界上沒有廢物，只有廢人。要是不會利用廢物的人，就是廢人。在我們的科學社裏，有許多儀器模型，都是利用廢物做成功的。沒有酒精燈，就用墨水瓶做一個起來；沒有軟木塞，就拿棉花棉布包裹而成；沒有玻璃管，就找幾根細竹管來代替一下。</p>
<p>小朋友們！靠着你們聰明的腦子，想出種種方法，儘量利用廢物，來製造成有用的東西。會利用廢物的，才配稱科學的孩子。</p>
<p>失敗就是成功的開始。要能不怕失敗，才會有成功的希望。不灰心，不怕難，是科學孩子應具的精神。</p>
<p>科學的孩子，是不涉迷信的，不用空想的，遇事必以科學的方法追求眞理。</p>
<p>小朋友們！料你們沒有一個不願意做科學的孩子罷！</p>
<h3>母親的愛</h3>
<p>— 袁山</p>
<p>在我的心的深處，時常如此歌頌着：在世界上惟有母親的愛，才是眞摯的，永久的，偉大的。</p>
<p>一個母親對於伊的兒女，無不是小心愛護，痛癢相關的；在兒女年幼時，總是不怕辛勞的照顧着伊們的冷熱和飢餓；有時兒婦自己還沒有覺得冷，伊已經覺察他們受着冷，便替他們加添衣服；有時兒女自己並不以爲熱，伊却己知道他們穿得過暖，就爲他們更換衣裳了。</p>
<p>偶然兒女的身體有不適意的時候，惟有爲母親的就不避辛苦，不分日夜的來看顧，如果病是重的，不用說，伊的心裹是非常不安的，急忙去請醫生呀！配藥呀！煎藥呀！雖然手脚弄得忙個不停，然而伊的臉上決不會現出疲倦討厭的態度來，始終是小心翼翼，惟恐不周的來看護着；如果看見兒女有痛楚時，則心裏史是憂愁，恨不得將兒女的痛拿來生在伊自己的身上；一旦兒女的病好了，伊便非常快樂，如釋重負，也好像伊自己的病好了一樣；呀！偉大的母親！伊總是以兒女的苦爲苦，以兒女的樂爲樂。</p>
<p>當兒女進學校讀書的時期，伊便不分寒暑的淸早起來意早飯，給女兒吃；以後上學校，又恐路上有危險，便親自送到學校裹，一日的飮食，都是母親忙着料理；並且伊又常常思索什麼菜蔬是伊的兒女所喜歡的？「體貼入微，無微不至，」這八個字，祇有母親對於兒女的愛，才能受之無愧。在平日伊無時無刻不督促兒女的學業，和爲人；更隨時隨地勉勵你，提醒你；你的過去伊旣已愛護，伊又看顧你的現在，伊更留意你的將來，呀！母親的愛，眞是永久而忍耐的愛。</p>
<p>無怪人要說：「世界上惟有母親者，是最幸福的人。」小朋友們！你將怎樣報答你母親的大恩呢？</p>
<p>在我的心的深處，又如此歌頌着：在世界上惟有母親的愛，才是眞摯的，永久的，偉大的。</p>
<h3>請到文化街去</h3>
<p>— 晚萸</p>
<p>時間眞快呵，一霎那，又是星期日了。</p>
<p>星期日，本是這一週來應該休息的一個日子。因爲從星期一到星期六這六日中，日日專心地致力學業，精神上不免要稍稍感到疲倦的；於是就利用星期日來休息一下，調養調養困憊的身心，預備在下星期可以加倍奮鬥。</p>
<p>所以一臨星期日，照理是應當暢快地消遣消遣，讓經過一週重壓下的胸懷能够找到寬敞舒適的機會。譬如到公園裹去散散步，呼吸一點新鮮的空氣；或是到電影院裏看含有敎育性的電影，增進一點知識；再不然，那末邀幾僩小朋友到自己家裹，說說笑話，講講故事，也未嘗不是沒有裨益的事情。</p>
<p>然而事實上，小朋友到了星期這一天，是很少找尋正當的樂來陶冶自己的性情的。是不是呢？如果不是爬在骯髒的地面打彈子，便是鬥香烟畫片，或是賭撲克，或是滾銅板，以及逗留在小販攤旁，打「貍貓換太子」「天下第一橋」之類，把大好的光陰消磨在無謂的賭博上，結果不僅時間上損失，精神上損失金錢上損失，而且還麥成了一種惡習慣。</p>
<p>是這樣，爲了使小朋友們不虞擲了星期日這一天的光陰，比較妥善的辦法，還是請小朋友們到文化街去吧！文化街便　是四馬路，在那邊，有的是書局跟雜誌公司，如商務印書館，中華書局，北新書局，大東書局，大衆書局，世界書局，兒童書局，以上海雜誌公司等，每個書店內都有大童的供給小朋友們閱看的書籍。各色各樣的書都有：文字的，圖畫的，小說的，故事的，更有科學的，自然學的，不，舉凡是屬於學術部門的，可以說是包刮無遺，應有盡有！</p>
<p>書店裏是把那些書雖列着，一任小朋友們去自由翻閱的，雖然書店方面希望小朋友在看了之後，能夠買它一二册回去，如果不買，也是沒有關係的。祇要小朋友們看的時候謹愼一些，別把書弄髒，或是撕破，他們是絕對歡迎，而且是絕對高興的到了那邊，除使便朋友們能得到豐富的學識外，同時精神方面，心理方面也一樣會獲到無上的愉快。至於思想上可以受到相當的訓練，尤其是預料得到的，原因是，有趣味的愛國的故事書，書局裏也陳列了不少。</p>
<p>如果有好的書看，小朋友們一定是樂於接近書本的，所以提議到文化街去，小朋友們想來是不會反對的。倘使果然因此而養成一種習慣，比之爬在弄堂裹賭博固然好得多，就是上公園，看電影，也不及進書店來得有益，來得實惠。</p>
<h3>新安江上</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之二十一—了七八天長的日子，早離別了遙闊的錢塘江，忽忽的把艷麗的富春江，在漆黑的夜中泛過去了。如今他們已進入了新安江的懷抱中。本是兩岸一片平坦的原野—將凋零的矮桑，翠綠的菜田，變成了層層疊疊的岡巒，可是在新安江，江面又狹窄了，天市地北的山岡和峯嶺，把江山船團團的圍住了。</p>
<p>「富春江是挺美麗的，在五」年前的春天，我會來遊過一次，意使我而忘返，願一生寄託在這樣美麗的大自然中。可是眞想不到在逃難期，雖不幸的錯過了富春江的遊覽，但新安江的風景也不差，眞是所謂失之東隅，收之桑榆了。我們的眼福不淺，像別人家連逃命也來不及，那有機會來遊賞呢？新安江的秋色，畢竟和五年前富春江的春景，另有一番風味，我們这種逃难是富有詩意的了。」明兒的父親兀立在船頭上，飽賞這美麗的景色，他又這樣的和明兒說着。</p>
<p>这一艘江山船在平波微浪的江面上蕩洋着。那靑翠的江水綫淺地，澄清得可以見到江底，一顆顆的石子，被江水磨琢得圓圓的。滑滑的，簡直是像一粒粒的五彩的明珠，紅的，緣的，黑的，白的，齊齊整整的舖着，活像一方錦繡的地毯。間或有一二尾的游魚在船底下追逐的擦過，一霎那之間，便消逝得無形無蹤了。蔚藍的天空中，一絲雲絮也沒有，二三成羣的白鴿，一高一低的在徘徊，好像在歡迎他們一羣異鄉的逃難人，它們有時像疲倦無力地落在水面上，不不久又升高起來。兩岸矗立的山峯，連一接二的排列着，大的山接着小的丘，高的峯連着低的巒，無窮盡的層疊。株株的小樹，點綴在山岡上，可是這時已是深秋的季節，枯黃的枯黃了，惟有聲株野楓，受了秋風秋雨的撫摩，反顯得格外的鮮艷。在船梢後望去，巍巍的羣峯疊嶂，隱隱的的的埋在烟嵐裏，一條迷漫的雲氣在山腰裏環繞</p>
<p>在那江水接天的遠處，點點的帆，倒映在如鏡平的江面上，雪白的帆影，翠綠的江水，眞如白玉鑲嵌在翡翠裏般的美麗。這時明兒身心大快，胸襟暢然。可是陣陣的微風吹在船帆上，船的速度也隨之加快了。明兒倒厭惡那船行得太快，不能細細遊覽道樣秀麗的河山</p>
<p>「爸爸，我們在船上坐上了好聲犬，害得我脚踝骨裏有些作酸，不如到岸上去走走，活動活動我們的筋骨，還可以遊山玩水，不是一舉兩得嗎？我們只要跟着　夫們走便好了。」明兒對着他父親說，父親也欣然的答應了。於是明兒隨着他父親等四人上了岸。</p>
<p>「你們要走得快一些，不要躭擱了我們的行程。」船老大起先一味推託，後來他見到明兒的堅決，祇得答應了。但他很擔心他們一定是跟不上的，於是當他們上岸的一霎那，便叮囑了這兩句話。</p>
<p>明兒一上了岸，好久關在樊籠裏面一旦得到自由的小鳥般的快樂，伸伸手，舉舉脚，舒舒筋骨，於是很快的追上了　夫們。</p>
<p>啊！好美麗呀！在船上所見的美麗祇有十分之一二。</p>
<p>一叢叢的樹林，如翠屛般的排列在山麓，而在叢林的深處，幾橡茅屋自成一個村落。那蜿蜒的小溪，潺潺地向着低窪處流去，撞擊在小石上，發出了顆顆的水珠，向着四周射去，頃刻間無踪無跡了。一縷縷的炊烟嬝娜地散佈在林間，如霧一般的籠罩着。田野裏的農人或是傴僂在田中，辛勤的工作，槎枒的烏柏樹，點綴在阡陌間，血紅的老葉，迎着秋風在擺蕩。明兒回頭一望，極目廖廓，江水蕩漾，茫無涯際，而他們那艘龐大的江山船，正是太倉一粟，微乎其微，簡直有些可憐了。一路上或是峭壁聳天，或是一片平野，五光十色，目不暇接。明兒一口氣隨着縴夫，崎嶇的山路，千盤百曲，或高或低，時狹時闊，害得他不敢仰視，不然，便翻身而入千山萬谷中了。還時明兒的父親，沿途採花遊覽，不道漸漸地落後。</p>
<h3>母愛（三）</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>媽媽：是呀！可是不過爲了你，不過爲了你，不過爲了我的丈夫，爲了孩子。……不！不！</p>
<p>我忘了唐尼，那我是不給你們的。（靜默）</p>
<p>安德萊：爸爸您知道媽媽是不錯的，小兄弟身子不結實，很瘦小，還沒長成哩！</p>
<p>喬治：他的性格也不很强，一時熱心得很，可又膽小的了不得。</p>
<p>媽媽：你們絲毫沒權這麼說！唐尼自己要投軍，他來講我，……我不許他去。爸爸：爲什麼？媽媽：因爲我不願棄剩我一個人，我除唐尼以外，沒有什麼了。李佳德！好兒子們，讓他跟我住着吧！他走了，我活着也無味，服侍我的，一個沒有，一切都沒有了。唉！兒子呀！我實在用不着把唐尼丟掉，難道你們不能理會嗎？好！好！你們說吧！你們可聽到我的話麼？（靜默）</p>
<p>祖父：天呀！怕他們用不着你這孩子了。怕已太遲了，我們的軍隊已經敗下來啦。</p>
<p>爸爸：（對着地圖）：還來得及哩，老爺爺。倘若我軍集中全力，一定能夠守住這條綫。</p>
<p>彼得：我現在倚賴我們的人民，爸爸。他們都武裝起來，……三他們就是在街上也要開槍！您看吧！就是小孩子們也預備出發啦！他們都拿起他們爸爸的槍了！</p>
<p>巨里安（看着他）：媽媽，你在這兒拿去的槍，放在那裏呀！</p>
<p>媽媽：爲了唐尼，我藏起來了。</p>
<p>巨里安：有一桿步槍要揩油哩。爸爸（細看地圖）這兒眞是一個天險，我軍能夠守得住的，——我願意親自前去佈置。</p>
<p>巨里安：媽媽，請您告訴我吧！那步槍放在那裏呀？</p>
<p>媽媽：你老是要這樣，要那樣。（她開了柚木衣櫥）在這裏哩。</p>
<p>巨里安：多謝您，（他拿出步槍，仔細察看。）這是一桿好槍呀。（便用破布擦槍揩油，）（靜默）</p>
<p>祖父：喂，媳婦，你可算得在這兒骨肉又團聚了。</p>
<p>彼得：你們聽見麼？</p>
<p>喬治：什麼？</p>
<p>彼得：這靜默……</p>
<p>安德萊：好像有人將要說話似的。……</p>
<p>彼得：誰？（他們面面相覷，於是都走近無綫電收音機）哇！我知道了！</p>
<p>爸爸（抬起頭）：怎麼一回事？（他又注目望着無綫電收音機，大家都面向着放聲器靜默着。）</p>
<p>媽媽：倘若你們願意，……只要你們不再談起那戰事。（她把機關開了）</p>
<p>男子聲音（由放聲器發出）：先頭部隊現在向着江邊開來了。義勇軍已把橋炸斷，準備死守公路到最後一個人。無論犧牲怎麼重大，不能不擋住敵軍。大家都說我們要失敗了，我們可是不退的。</p>
<p>女子聲音（由放聲器發出）喂！聽着，你們可聽見麼？趕快把民衆都調集攏來，去打。調集所有的民衆！現在我們不是爲自衛而戰，爲的是替我們的祖宗，替我們的兒孫，保全土地。我們用祖宗兒孫的名義召集全國人民，一律武裝起來！</p>
<p>媽媽：我不把他給你們的！男子聲音：喂！喂！聽呀，北軍司令報告說：我軍正在且退且戰，每一吋土地，每一處地皮上的標記，每一所房子，都曾經過惡戰，爭奪的。農民都不肯拋棄他們的家逃走，現已拿着槍保衛着哩。死的人數一分一分鐘地增高了。</p>
<p>安德萊：可憐那……</p>
<p>爸爸：這是正理該當…他們帮助阻止敵軍前進。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（二）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>他所自以爲得意的。是結識了一個馬車夫的兒子小湯。小湯粗暴殘忍，也從有讀過書，他的惡作劇的本領，却是比衆不同，彭其不　都從小湯那裏，一一學會了。他們倆常常一塊兒去看屠夫殺猪，或是帮助人家去溺死過多的小貓小狗，都覺得津津有味。後來更進一步，索性學會了鬥鷄鬥狗獵鼠獵貓種種玩意。</p>
<p>彭其的父親是個多病的人，他又沒有兄弟，所以沒有人來糾正他的行爲，指點他走到正路上去。他不想讀書向上，只是以殘忍爲行樂，越殘忍越見得丈夫氣。他以爲自己倘然心腸軟一些，就比不上馬車夫的兒子小湯，而要被小湯所笑了。</p>
<p>彭其和小湯那麼一個孩子做了朋友那裹還有敦品勵行的希望。小湯因爲是個馬軍夫的兒子，出身先就低賤，所以最怕走到人家客廳中去，一進了門，就覺得手足無措的，好不目在，然而他一到了馬房裏，可就有說有笑興高采烈了。他在村子裏許多小朋友當中，是個出名的英雄；每逢初夏風和日麗的時光，他常在河邊用石塊擲死青蛙，總是百發百中，而爲小朋友們所一致佩服的。</p>
<p>彭其有了這麼一個好友，的確和他那兩位灰褐色眼睛的美貌小妹妹一天疎遠一天了。他的大妹妹曾悽然的向人說道：「彭其從不把我們倆放在眼裏，因爲我們是女孩子的緣故，可是我們也不能勉强他，只得將諾克斯當做我們的哥哥了。」</p>
<p>諾克斯是一頭挺大的鬈毛狗，一半是獵狗種，一半是紐芬蘭種，因爲它的毛烏黑得像夜色一樣，所以被稱爲諾克斯的。諾克斯週身烏黑，不過脚掌是棕色的，尾巴的下面有一個灰色斑點罷了。如今兩位小妹妹推舉它做了哥哥，却也當之無愧，倘和彭其相比，它還是比較的像個樣兒。</p>

<h3>疋頭　川滇帮現銷開展</h3>
<p>布國　本街客帮現銷仍乏起色、市面陷入呆途、尤以華北恢復通用法幣後、囤貨之風漸熄、市盤轉趨下落、故津帮購意大衰、惟西南川滇帮現銷略有開展、成交色布。色斜。漂白整理疋頭一百數十箱、細布細斜五十包、浙東溫州等帮續辦三兎細斜。富貴大鵬細布。怡和各磅粗布七八十包、粵帮辦色布·色斜·府綢·細布·等貨近五十件、本街批發號辦粗布·漂布·府綢·印花色丁·花布·僅門市及內地帮小批發生意各檔俱乏躉額成交、售盤亦趨下游、白貨花色貨散戶小額頗有廉價脫售、按大市每疋低一二角、</p>
<p>東布　昨細布斜市面、晨漲午疲、做開十二磅龍頭細布高盤做開十三元五角五分、低盤回降至三角半、後市復升至四角五分、本街同業交易稍轉起色、人心漸趨穩定、採辦細布細斜七八百件、阿部市洋行間出本月份龍頭細布二百包、每疋價爲十三四角、又東棉洋行訂出下月期寳貝細斜一百件、每疋價十二元、但北帮銷路仍寂靜、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭三百九十件、運往汕頭、又五十六件運往香港、日各帮來源、河下共到松江及南港帮六七號、</p>
<h3>糧食　米糧到存兩旺　最高價仍在十七元七八角</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下共到松江及南港帮六七號、車輪包子蘇同帮三千四五百包、崑山帮來六百餘包、當錫帮雖云該地封境、實則暗運到埠者、亦不在少、每日運到有一千五六百包、蕪湖方面、只要加稅成功、出口並無阻礙、故到貨亦源源而來、且滬埠有底豐富、據米商約計、棧貨與店備、尙有百萬担左右、是則米價當無暴漲之理由、但因前日本市特殊情形、兩租界當局緊急戒備、人心遂學忐忑不安、對於米糧不無有關、致吃戶購備擁擠、店家爲謀應付計、逐不論高價、大事搜進、客戶又在居奇、昨日租界戒備旣弛、人心卽定、後來源已旺、在此雙重情形之下、米市逐起變化、本街銷塲旣懈、囤戶大都回出、而經售者亦以爭先脫信爲快、致霎時市塲籌碼呈供過於求之勢、貨價即起跌風、若常帮高粳開手、祇售十七元八角、後又小一角、爲十七元七角、較前市已落二三角、其餘各粳及薄稻市亦然如是、杜洋尖埠尖以市貨無多、略貶角許、而白元雖洋糯猛甩六七角、且其交易零星、然以粳價相較、未肯虧脫、故呈平疲之局、總之此種市面、似乎大漲小回、米商操縱之心未死、波瀾正未可限耳、</p>
<p>客秈昨晨被粳米銳落影響、客囤頗有求售之趨向、且囤戶以貯存浜北棧房、乃虞提貨或有不便、因此紛紛出樣、晨市京蕪秈統小二三角、然後市售方心思轉好、又擬擯守堅持、且西貢回電十九元七角、比前日電訊報漲二角、新交易未克成議、客秈售價立時回振一二角、西貢現貨仍擯守十九元五六角之前盤、洋元米存到兩多、已續小二角、</p>
<h3>麺粉津帮　成交一批　粉廠特爲眨價一角　小麥續到四千餘包</h3>
<p>粉市交易、略見起色、南北兩幫、需要漸增、蓋北洋幫已久未暢辦、近以當地粉價一鬆落、及滙水問題、對於吃盤極重視、非廉價不願接受、而廠方爲打開悶局起見、特予貶價、以圖動銷、故二號粉價曾由四元五角半現鈔降至四元四角半，較前已跌去一角、而砲車牌僅售四元六角滙劃、聞津幫昨成交一批額計三萬包、而北幫亦係試辦性質、正式市面、大致於下週初或可實現矣、昨日粉銷、除北幫整批成交外、其餘南洋幫及其他內地客戶去化、均屬平常、本街零批、亦未見旺、蓋本街批價、仍須四元五角之原盤也、</p>
<p>小麥來源、堪稱蟬聯、計由內地常錫等處運到四千餘包、聞近日內地陳貨、紛紛推出、更傳產價猛跌、貨方已無法扳持、均願隨市而脫、聞北江麥送廠貨祗開六元一角、對於中决麥尚須進關、而貨方擬待日商之垂靑、致交易仍居擯局云、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷雖無生氣　棉紗多頭重來拖進　雙馬天女漲五六元　日紗有回籠閉裝申說</h3>
<p>連下日數之紗市、昨得環境好轉、租界上障礙綱業已屛除、恢復原狀、交通照常、人心安謐、加之一般散戶額子、大都斬結淸楚、虛風一定、轉趨堅昂、至於大戶皆在多頭地位、反動乃劇、市盤乃步步上騰、但客方實銷依然呆木而無生色、僉之閩海受日艦騷擾影響、裝運貨物停止、惟港滇兩帮交易不斷、採辦之額殊微、同業及從業者吸收紛至沓來、市盤因而邁步前進、總之須恃實銷來培植礎基、當可鞏固也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業相聚口齒　緊、因租界問題鬆弛、人心大見良好、一變賣出反進、開盤即漲一二元、雙馬門票價爲四百十四元、棧單四百○九元、少頃人氣忽見熱烈、買風陡熾、叫價節節前進、多係同業投機性質、一見氣勢順利一味拖進、以致互相抬高、雙馬外棧現貨最高價曾達四百二十三元、棧單價爲四百十七元、迨至收盤、買戶稍淸、而獲利者出節、略形回挫一二元之譜、午後開盤實際交易仍屬平常、惟人心仍昂、雙馬棧單始做四百十四元半、後有回升一步至十六元、收盤價回小五角、外棧現貨價始終爲四百二十一元半、查全日各帮買去統計一千四百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲五元牛、天女漲六元、雙地球漲三元半、牧羊漲二元、共他十支粗紗依然平平、今日有棉紗八百二十件運汕頭、七百件運香港、一千零四十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額貫列左、同行七七五香港四八五汕頭　一五○　內地　四五統計一、四五五</p>
<p>日紗市百、始漲繼疲、結果較上日爲跌、且氣勢異常衰弱、蓋以客銷停滯、人心允虛、且傳外埠售價旣廉、而無銷塲、有回籠裝運來申說、二十支月琴紗晨做三百五十五元、午跌至三百四十八元、比上日要落三元光景、</p>
<h3>海外漲風大熾　本棉廠辦轉活　蘇北來源已通　到貨亦漸暢旺</h3>
<p>棉市價、紐的棉市晨初先因利物浦及孟買電告猛漲、引起外商之購進及大部份空戶之抵補、市價上漲一至九磅音、後因華盛頓方面盛傳貸款棉之放出、棉價略呈回疲之狀、結果近期不動、運期略跌三五磅音、昨日印度連同預測又漲二羅比、惟昨日午後來電、聞孟買開盤棉市預測略見回小一羅比餘、埃及昨日又漲二十餘磅音、折合法幣、美棉不動、印棉漲七角、埃及棉漲一元餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、中外各廠均爲靜寂異常、即同業亦無交易聞、此實乃海外棉漲風太熾之故也、巴西棉雖較美棉爲廉、然以品質之分析、實不及美棉殊甚、况日來巴西棉因定出過多、地頭價格因之又高元餘、故目前各項外棉均告停頓、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價列下、原料　類別　送廠連稅六十支　埃及棉高級　一○九·六五又　又　中級　一○六·七○八十支　又　高級　一三○·一○又　又　中級　一一九·六五二十支美米特林　九三·五○又　又　下級　八○·三○三十二　又　一○二·三○又　又　下級九　三·四○四十二支　又　一○四·二○又　又　下級　九二·○五又　南美巴西棉高級　九二·八五又　又中級　九○·六五又　又下級　八七·三○十支印平果兒　六九·六五十六支印與默拉　七六·○○二十支印白洛區　八一·六○二十四支印康波地　八七·六○三十二支美種辛特　九一·二○三十二　四十二支美種彭加浦九五·七五</p>
<p>印棉昨日又有五百十五件進口、由英輪蒲登（譯音）號自孟買運來、停靠於浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<p>本棉呆滯已久、近日逐現活潑發展之象、故售價益臻佳境而上升、蓋邇來美印棉市步步昂騰、發現本年以來之新高峯、美棉現貨價將近一角關口、印棉白洛去四五月期之塊角漲出一百七十一羅比外、採算價日見增進、與本棉之價漸漸接近、因之各廠購辦之意轉趨活絡、永安中新裕兩廠納胃殊健、同時蘇北一路來源、已擯持多日、業已設法疏通、到貨甚爽、據云路途之雜費、被人剝削龐大也、計通州花到一千四百九十八包、木架花到六百二十件、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>

<h3>製造局洋人被焚</h3>
<p>上海製造局之畫船樣英人克勒士一的，與造船木匠英人免倫兩人，向在局前樓房居住。本月廿一日，又有向居龍華地方之造林明敦槍彈子英人威一林士，到來探望，是夜亦在樓房內歇宿。忽於是夜一點鐘，突見火光燭天，從克氏住房而起，想因天氣寒冷，晚間煖爐火熾，延燒樓板所致。當時局內官員工匠的數百人，羣起搶護，無如火勢過烈，樓房全是木板；且有木料各件，堆存樓下，而洋人克勒士的等所住之房，樓門窗戶，均已透紅房內人勢難出來，房外人無法進內救護，所有洋人克勒士的等住房，及木樣板之樓房，　計十二間，均已燒燬。救至天亮，火始熄滅。於灰燼中，險得綫骨三堆，即克勒士的等三人，火中不能逃脫，已被燒斃。是日局內官員，即通訊上海縣及英領事官，請其勘騐，殊可慘也！</p>

<h3>肉與米</h3>
<p>— 才淸</p>
<p>本市宰牲公司和鮮肉業，因「牲畜市塲」壟斷猪隻，爲表示一致的態度起見，一律於十三日起停宰停市。現在接受兩租界當局的勸導，已暫時復業，在兩租界維持民食的努力下，鮮肉業此决的停市，可以說獲得相當的結果。</p>
<p>猪肉是我們日常必需之品，在這停市的一星期中，一般住戶感到一種習慣上的不便，也是有的；但是回敎徒是不食猪肉的，上海也正不知有多少人終年不知肉味，况現在炎夏將臨，即使無肉可食，在衛生和節的兩方面，也都大有裨益者也。</p>
<p>所以現在最値得注意的是米的問題。因爲囤戶的投機操縱，頭號米已超過十七元，中次各米，也都漲到限價以上。據昨天報載：因嚴厲執行限價，及取締暗盤交易，市塲管理委員會主席符前耕曾接得恐嚇函件；同時米號同業也發出「闡明眞相」的公函，我們局外人，自然無從判別個中曲直；不過米價高漲，是每個人所身受的。不食肉可以，我們却怎能不食米呢？我們以市民的資格來呼籲，希望立即消除「漲價的內幕」，不要再增加我們的負担了。</p>
<p>再說，以米價高漲來和鮮肉停市對照起來，這情形恰恰是背道而馳，所謂「捫心自問」，現在正是最好的測騐時期。</p>
<h3>「家庭服務部」訪問記</h3>
<p>— 敬久</p>
<p>戰爭造成了孤島空前的「繁榮」，不過這「繁榮」是畸形的，消費的，不健全的。在五百萬人口中，從事生產的究有若干？大部分還不是從內地以及淪陷區投奔來的人們。在「長安居大不易」的生活中，「開源節流」實是目前的一個大問題，如何「開源」？除了從事生產，增加生產之外沒有第二條路。至於「節流」，那就非得從减輕消費着想不可。</p>
<p>最近有一家銀號來負起了這個任務，這不能不說是一樁値得注意的事情</p>
<p>幾天前我在本埠幾家報紙上看到了一則廣告，這是成業銀號添設「家庭服務部」的廣告，，內容非常簡單，只刋着「减除麻煩，活動經濟，提倡節的，解除疑難」十六個大字。我受了好奇心的衝動，同時也因爲不明白個中的情形，就在下一天的上午，到那邊去作了一次的訪問。他們的地址是在九江路大陸大樓，我到了三樓就看到了「成業銀號附設家庭服務部」的字樣，隨卽推進了門，向茶役聲明了來意，便在會客室裏等候約莫三四分鐘，一位身材不高的人出來接見，我們交換了卡片，知道他是該號經理陳先生。我和他聲明了來意後，就此開始問到他創辦家庭服務部的旨趣，和它內部的大概情形，承告如次：該部服務的範圍，暫分四組：（一）委托代理收付組：如委托收付賬款，完全責任。（二）抵押透支組：爲各界謀經濟之活動。（三）消費合作組：凡住戶日常需米，煤，柴，炭等物，都可委托代辦。（四）人事諮詢組：應付人事變化。加入的手續也十分簡單，只須按月繳付最低廉的手續費，領取該部憑證，就可享受以上四組權利。說到這裏這我就和該經理告別了。我想，這對於孤島住戶確是一椿有利益的事，因此很樂意介紹給居留孤島上的人們。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>當心陷阱</h3>
<p>— （倩）</p>
<p>家鄉給砲火毀滅了，避難到孤島上來，舞塲是通宵營業，電影院天天掛着客滿的牌子，我們是在鴿棚中難民式的生活也有難於維持之勢了，所以急於想找到一些工作以免饔飱不繼之虞。舍戚趙君，途遇舊同學韓某，謂現服務於虹口×××路××汽水公司，要添一個接電話的人，把我介紹了去，並急爲我領了「通行證」，我因得業而竊爲欣幸，然其因我之是吾能勝任服務而惴惴不安。</p>
<p>第一天去服務，那兒是一宅西式的洋房，設備極爲簡單，樓上一間稱爲寫字間的，擺着二張寫字台，坐着兩個華服少年，和一個華語很流利的俄人，就在一張裝置電話的寫字台上呌我坐下了，說如果有電話來呌汽水就紀録下來，就算我的工作。</p>
<p>辦公時間是上午九時至十一時，下午二時至五時，電話很少，他們就常常找我談話，說我不應那樣拘謹，而讓人視爲落伍，歐美的婦女是如何善於交際的，他們願爲我添置新裝同我逛電影院等的話逗引我，又說公司中下星期將要有五萬箱汽水的交易，一元一箱的回佣，公司中同人就有五萬元的分潤，到了第五天，他們忽拿着一疊鈔票交給我，堅不讓我回家，幸舍戚適來探望，方始能逃出囚範。</p>
<p>上海眞是一個黑暗的世界，遍地生着荊棘，我想，迢不是一個單純玩弄女性的騙術，定有更大的黑幕在後面，敬草此文，願女同志求業者之注意。</p>

<h3>言與行</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>「不顧行，行不顧言，」這種人天然不敢贊同，因爲他的行爲，或者與言語不符，或者竟是絕對相反，則有言不若無言。</p>
<p>但是僅有其言，而絕無行爲表現，則其言等於無言，不若不言之爲愈，因爲不言，他人本不希望其行，若旣有言，則他人必深望其言之實行，與行之適如其言，故口惠而實不至的虛言，令人最是失望。</p>

<p>何家兩位小姐聽了，很爲感歎，便問：「這位徐老先生此刻還强健嗎？他旣無兒女，此刻不是孑然一身嗎？」朱村長道：「世上的事，頗難逆料。常徐老頭兒把所有資產，捐輸國家的時候，果然出於他一片忠義愛國之心。但不免也因爲他嗣續無人，要這許多家產無用，有些憤激的意思在內。况且他以爲自己年紀老了，等到這一次仗打下來，他也早已墓木高拱的了。誰知他直到如今，還是健在，這眞是出於他自已的　料之外了。剛纔何小姐問他：此刻是吾是孑然一身？噯！尤其是呌人聽了奇怪，他在七！幾歲上，娶了夫人，而且現在還生了兒子咧。」何雙玉何儷玉兩小姐，聽了邰驚異起來道：「眞的嗎？那眞是奇聞了！」朱村長歎息道：「所以我說世上的事，很難逆料。徐老頭子毀家紓難，對於各處的游擊隊資助不少，那時游擊隊中有一位中隊長，也是他們水竹村人，這人姓謝，很有勇氣。他出入於游擊區中，對方見了他很爲頭痛。後來由中隊長升爲大隊長，部下的人很多，但道一筆餉項，公家有時來不及，全是徐老頭子籌墊的。姓謝的是兄妹兩人，他的妹妹名字喚做阿玉，是一個寡婦，那時年紀也一十五六歲了。別瞧她是個女人呀，她能變手開槍，百發百中。最初他們水竹村人，呼之爲女兵，實在她可以統率一小隊人，出入於游擊區內。因爲謝氏兄妹，和徐老頭子是同一村莊的人，在經濟上都由他帮助。後來謝阿玉的哥哥陣亡了，一切身後之事，均由徐老頭子料理，以及孤兒寡婦，也使地各得其所。這個游擊隊，由上級另派人帶領，阿玉也不再在軍中了。不過常往來徐老頭子家中，或者那位老翁，有什麼疾病憂愁等事，她　看　他，安慰他。因爲他那時眞是孑然一身呢。當時有人說了一句笑話，勸阿玉嫁了這老頭子吧。阿玉倒心有所動。她本來不想嫁人，但她的不想嫁人，並不是守着舊禮敎，預備貞節誇示於人。但有時又感到寂寞，而覺得與這位老頭子的感情很好，大家都是孑然一身，何妨併合起來呢。」（一一五）</p>
<h3>「孟頓小姐」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>The　Mad　Miss　Manton</p>
<p>雷電華公司出品　大上海戲院映</p>
<p>「孟頓小姐」是張偵探片。不錯，是張偵探片。同時，它可和瓊白郞黛兄的一偵探夫人」一樣，是以鬧劇的方式來處理的。甚至在主演者的作風上，白蓓蘭史丹薇（附告讀者：她最近和勞勃泰勒結婚了。）也和瓊白郞黛兄相似。</p>
<p>在好萊塢，這樣鬧劇化的偵探片已經是成爲一時的風氣了。何以會如此呢？這是可以讓我們來討論一下的。</p>
<p>依我看來，偵探片的鬧劇化，其原因不外是如下「一個：（一）藍鷹運動」已經過去了。「格殺不論」的偵探片已經成了强弩之末，爲了換換新鮮，銀幕上便不再是流彈橫飛而是笑語如珠；（二）一般的偵探片，要自始至終的疑陣疊出，空氣緊張，也的確不容易；而且，爲了使紳士淑女這一類觀衆看了不喫力又不乏味起見，偵探片的鬧劇化便以戀愛喜劇和偵探片一雙倂盆一的姿態而出現。換一句話說，也即是電影商人的所謂「生　眼」也。</p>
<p>然而這樣的一倂盆式電影是吾即是問題的解決呢？這個，我想問你：當這樣「倂盆式」的「偵探喜劇」（請恕我杜撰道一個名稱）又流爲「差不多」而爲觀衆厭倦的時候，它的前途又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>自然這是後話，而現在，「偵探喜劇」也者，則正是「時菜。」。」我們就來看看這「時菜」之一的「孟頓小姐</p>
<p>孟頓小姐是個任性好奇的小姐，他的和新聞記者彼得相識（你常然知道，他們後來是「必然」結成夫婦的）是因爲彼得嘲笑了他的空報慘案，於是孟頓趕到報館里去，一見面就打了他一下耳光，彼得也立刻回敬了她一下耳光，再一個於是，他們就時常因爲這件案子而時常碰面，於是就「漸生愛慕之意」而「親愛的」而「情投意合，遂結成夫婦」了。至於慘案的經過，那是不必在這裏贅述的，反正就是這一套。社會根據呢，目的旣在使偵探片的鬧劇化，就也不管它了。</p>
<p>等因奉此，你如果想消造消遣，那麼這個戲還勉强可以一看；想到得一些什麼敎益一，那是沒有的。除非你是個電影從業員（允其是導演，）那麼在這裏看看他的明爽的剪輯，脚色性格的刻劃，可以給你多個參考。</p>
<p>白蓓蘭史丹薇的孟頓小姐演得不壞，她很使我想起愛琳鄧在「紅杏枝頭」裹的那股模樣，不過還不及「紅杏枝頭」中愛琳鄧的那樣豪放。亨利方達則我以爲他還是不演風流小生的好，像靑年漁夫這一類脚色（和陶樂珊拉摩喬治賴甫德合演的「北海漁光」就是這一類脚色，）才比較適台一些，無他，渾厚老實有餘，浦洒風流則不足也。</p>
<p>其餘配角，也殊平平。所有空氣，則還虧由於導演所製造。</p>

<h3>崑曲復興之感想</h3>
<p>秋平</p>
<p>崑曲柔和馴雅，二百年來，海字承平，賢士大夫，治事之餘，金尊玉笛奏流水高山之曲，名不爲　，利不爲鎖矣。光緒末葉，秦皮盛而此調衰，以至今日南存仙霓，北剩韓白，廣陵絕調，感慨系之。然仙霓社十餘年來，苦心孤詣，藝事日進，若奈何天，南樓傳，昭君和番，三笑，皆其新排本。一字一腔之檢討，研求竟日，直有達摩面壁之功：而聽衆尚不能普及趨向，則潮流使然，亦瓦釜雷鳴有以致也。</p>
<p>戲劇之盛衰，與票友之關係極重，近來平票有兼習崑腔者，曲社之興，漸趨濃厚，平聲賡春，月必同期，樂天居士創辦之戯曲硏究會，延紅豆館主執牛耳焉。而朱傳茗，張傳芳，鄭傳鑑輩，橫笛吟腔，酬應頻仍；又聞各大學，有詞曲一科，學生業餘，以曲爲邊，忠孝友愛之情，慷慨悲壯之狀，大都均散見諸傳奇，如桃花扇，鐵冠圖，琵琶記，拜月亭諸作，不但重文藝，抑且有益於世道人心，由此觀之，崑曲不將復興乎！</p>
<p>以今日仙霓社言，寥寥十餘人，頗見精采，武劇有汪傳　，方傳芸，跌扑甚爲賣力；傳淞以陰靜勝；周傳瑛以風流儒雅勝，俱極化境。所望該社，同舟共濟，力持殘局，　料天地淸而後，文風振作，曲必駕趨而上。杏書君述布景與服裝宣傳，三者爲復興崑曲之要旨，其言良善。予聞崑伶不懸牌，演戲無先後，龍套無階級，此皆曲門特點。前年基伶出國，演西廂盛門如市，而不用布景，蓋　影繪聲，皆在詞中透露，惟宣傳不可缺，希望曲家考證事實，提倡忠節，說明詞曲，褒貶良　，一方面培植笛師，嘉勉鼓勵，相輔而行。若得有力者飲助經濟則崑曲復興，更指日可待矣。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>美術界義賣觀後感</h3>
<p>— 羅丁</p>
<p>義賣這名詞從香港帶到上海來還不久，而在公開的塲合能舉行義賣的，上海的美術界恐怕還算是第一砲，前幾天有一個從香港回來的朋友告訴我，香港義賣的總數收入竟達到國幣一百多萬，因此這决上海開宗明義的義賣運動，、似乎有一看的必要。</p>
<p>走進會場門就遇到幾位負責人，承他們的指引，我很快的就把全會塲的作品看過了，當然，這些作品，並不是一般自稱爲藝術家的人所願意看的東西，西爲裹面並沒有什麼宗什麼派的神奇作品，大部分都是商用美術品和美術工藝品，因爲要達到易於銷售的目的，這些作品是冉適合沒有了。最引人注目的要算是新興工藝社出品的蓓蒂開臘染用品。這是把一種流傳到中國來未久的染色方法，由幾位美術專家親自繪製出來的心血結晶品，所以在外表和實用上都是超高一等，因此這些出品銷售數目也特別的多，其餘如都錦生的絲織和傘扇，國畫和古董等都是值得購買的東西</p>
<p>該會負責人並向我說明這次展覽會的雙重意義，第一他說到這次展覽會中的出品特別着重在工藝美術和商用美術品的原因。他說道是很明顯的，在這抗建大業裹遭是我們美術界應該負起的仟務，中國工商業的不如人家，是無可否認的，我們必需要推進生產事業，當然，美術界不是事業家，可是在改良國貨，發展銷路，他是具有很大的效能的。用美術來輔助生產事業的改良和發展，中外是一樣的；在這建設新中國的現在，是更切迫需要的了，所以這决展覽並不是忽略了別種藝術作品，本來的用意就是要在工商業美術上多陳列點。第二他談到困在孤島上美術家的處境困難，但是爲搶救自己的良心，不得不做些稍有意義的事，救濟難民，也是一件切迫的事，每一個難民就是國家的一份力量，爲了要保存這份力量的存在，是時時刻刻需要救濟的。並且，時令已近夏季，醫藥方面的需要更加殷切，他說這决所有收人，除去了幾位作家和出品商號的成本，還有會場開支外，是預備購些醫藥用品來贈送難民的。</p>
<p>聽說這决銷售的成績，當然比不上香港那樣，但是很有可買的東西，爲了良心，是値得去走一趟，並且那裏的東西，是有很多別的地方看不到的。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>杜美大戲院　定下週末開募</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>自從上海人口　增發生了擠居的情形之後，娛樂塲所每家客滿，而電影院的營業鼎盛，也竟造成了空前的紀錄。因此除了舊有的電影院之外，在最近一年之中，租界上面，又出現了聲家新建的電影院。現在據說杜美大戲院也已建築完成，佈置就緒，馬上耍開幕了。</p>
<p>杜美大戯院在法租界杜美路九號，建築的式樣非常新頴，已定下週末正式開幕，而預定開幕日所公映的第一部影片是米高梅的出品「舊金山」（SanFraucisco）</p>
<p>這所影院不但建築得很好，就是室內的空氣也調節得非常適當。他如發聲的裝置，都是最新式樣，而座位也很舒服寬暢。總之全個戲院的建築，十分堅固，所有器具，都很華麗美觀，陳飾雖是簡單，但配置很是適當。</p>
<p>特別可提出的一點，就是這個影院的後面，有一個寬大的園子，可供觀衆遊散，是上海一般影院所沒有的。杜美大戲院也由外人投資經營，專映第二輪外片，票價大致和其他專映第二輪外片的影院差不多的。</p>

<h3>English Declaration Regarding Japan: Unacceptable Changes to the Shanghai Concession System; Notification States the Municipal Council Has Already Made Concessions; Alterations to Concession Administration Must Be Discussed with China; Following Three-Nation Recommendation, Japanese Troops Will Withdraw from Gulangyu</h3>
<p>(London) The British government's reply to Japanese demands regarding the Shanghai International Settlement firmly rejects the idea, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council has already made concessions to Japan. It also points out that it is not yet the time to alter the Land Regulations. Furthermore, the main points of the British reply have been published. Reportedly, when British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on Friday, he expressed absolute support for the memorandum delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry the previous day by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. The British reply states that Japan's intense demands can only be raised with relevant governments during normal times. These "relevant governments" include China. As China is currently at war with Japan, the issue of modifying the Land Regulations should not be discussed at this time. The British reply clearly points out that the Shanghai Municipal Council has indeed made concessions to Japan, such as increasing the number of Japanese staff within the Council and the Council discussing plans with the Japanese regarding anti-Japanese activities with the Police Department.

<p>(London) According to official sources here, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, stated during his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that he supported the U.S. position that it is currently inappropriate to discuss altering the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement. The British Ambassador also presented Britain's observations on Japan's May 3rd proposal to change the administration of the concession. It is reported that Sir Robert, in supporting the U.S. view, said that any changes to the concession's administration must be discussed with other governments, and China is one of those that must be consulted. He stated that this is currently impossible. (May 20, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita told the cabinet today that all sailors would be withdrawn from the Gulangyu International Settlement. The Gulangyu incident will be resolved peacefully. According to Japanese reports, the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the landing of troops from Western powers there was suggested by the naval authorities of a third country. Naval authorities from the U.S., Britain, and France advised naval authorities on Gulangyu on Thursday that troops from all countries should withdraw from the International Settlement simultaneously. Currently, the U.S., Britain, France, and Japan each have forty-two troops stationed on Gulangyu. (May 20, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Admiral Noble to Remain on Gulangyu</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the British warship HMS Thanet left Shanghai on Thursday for repairs in Hong Kong. The British destroyer HMS Daring, which replaced the Thanet, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday (May 19th) afternoon. It will remain here pending the arrival of Admiral Sir Charles Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Station, on the HMS Birmingham. In addition, Rear Admiral Holt, commander of the British Yangtze Flotilla flagship HMS Scarab, which patrols the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Both ships are berthed at the British naval pontoon behind the U.S. Asiatic Fleet's USS Augusta. The British Navy in Shanghai replied to inquiries that day, saying that Admiral Noble would remain on Gulangyu until the situation there became clearer, before coming to Shanghai on the HMS Birmingham. The departure of HMS Thanet from Shanghai was a routine action, as it had been decided that the ship should undergo a thorough refit in Da Nang. The date of Admiral Noble's arrival in Shanghai has not yet been determined, but sources believe he will soon leave Gulangyu. Originally, the HMS Birmingham was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 19th, but after Japanese troops landed on Gulangyu, the ship with Admiral Noble on board sailed to the island to monitor developments and protect British interests.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aggression Already Subject to Restrictions</h3>
<p>Manila - Philippine newspapers stated in their commentaries yesterday that Japan's plan to create a "new order" in East Asia excludes people of all nations except the Japanese. However, this plan may become a mere "blue photograph" due to the combined actions of the British, French, and American navies in Xiamen's public criminal Gulangyu. The commentary said, "When Japanese marines encounter united resistance and withdraw from Gulangyu, the Japanese must at least admit and recognize that their aggression has indeed been subject to some restrictions. If Britain, France, and the United States continue to protect their concessions in China, even at the risk of events that could lead to war, it is because they have not given up hope of rebuilding commerce on the vast lands of China. From this, we can anticipate that Japan will never be the true master of China unless it engages in conflict with the third-party powers. Moreover, if the Gulangyu incident is sufficient to demonstrate the nature of Japanese militarism, then Japan will not proceed to engage in a war with the powers. Therefore, Japan's attempt to monopolize the new Asia will hardly be realized beyond reaching the stage of a blue photograph." (May 20, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives yesterday passed a resolution advocating that the House elect six people to form a committee to study the situation of Japanese infiltration into the Philippines, and allocating US$100,000 in funding to obtain all necessary information for the U.S. Congress to refer to when legislating on the status of the Philippines and to determine what kind of relationship the United States should maintain with the Philippines in the future.

<h3>Japanese Troops Trapped in a Corner of Northern Hubei; Their Route of Retreat Cut Off; Chinese Reinforcements Stationed in Zaoyang City and Actively Pressing Towards Suixian; Chinese Forces in Northern Jiangxi Recapture Hanxi</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese offensive in central Hubei and southern Henan has been exhausted, and the overall situation has shifted under the control of the Chinese. All the villages and towns from Zhangjiaji in eastern Xiangyang to Xiaohongshan have been recaptured, and Japanese collaborators are being mopped up. Fierce fighting is taking place on both sides of Zhongxiang Changshoudian. In the Suixian-Zaoyang area, Chinese forces are advancing on multiple routes, and the war situation is improving. (Morning of May 21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The Japanese troops invading northern Hubei have suffered heavy casualties from Chinese forces for more than ten days, and their route of retreat has been cut off by the Chinese. The Japanese troops surrounded in a corner of northern Hubei are running out of food and ammunition and are only being supplied with biscuits by aircraft.

The Japanese troops retreated towards Jingshan and Zhongxiang, and the Chinese forces seized many spoils. (May 20th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports today, Japanese troops in southern Henan are now retreating towards Zaoyang in Hubei. The Japanese troops may encounter a surprise attack, as unconfirmed Chinese reports claim that Chinese forces recaptured Zaoyang today. The reason why the Japanese troops in southern Henan began to retreat is due to the success of the Chinese forces in central Hubei, especially due to the victories of the Chinese forces on the highways from Hankou to Yichang and from Jingshan to Zhongxiang, as this move threatened the rear of the Japanese forces. (May 20, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Changsha) From late last month to the beginning of this month, a certain unit of the Chinese forces repeatedly entered and exited the Xianning-Pucheng area in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway and engaged in bloody battles with the Japanese forces several times, killing thousands of Japanese soldiers. According to the report of the Lianbao Director of Xianning Baozheng Township, he witnessed more than thirty large trucks of Japanese corpses being transported from Tingsiqiao, Maqiao, and Guanbuqiao to Wuchang. The wounded were continuously transported along the way without interruption for half a month. It is also heard that the victory of this unit was due in part to the enthusiastic cooperation of the staff of the Maintenance Associations in various places in southern Hubei, who bravely acted as guides, and in part to the sincere cooperation of the people. Wherever the army went, the people competed to provide firewood and rice, offered to do laundry, and stood around offering comfort as if they were family members. (May 19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui - The Japanese troops at Daqiao River (located at the intersection of the Ruiwu-Gan'e two highways) in northeastern Wuning were attacked by Chinese forces again on the morning of the 17th, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and seizing a large amount of ammunition and equipment.

<p>Fengcheng - About three to four hundred Japanese troops advanced towards Huafang Xincun (60 li south of Nanchang) in the afternoon of the 17th. The Chinese forces fought bravely.

Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. (May 19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Dongxiang - The fighting on the west bank of the Fu River is calm, but Japanese artillery from the Wuyangdu area occasionally fires at Chinese positions to create a false show of strength to prevent the Chinese from attacking. There has been an increase in the number of Japanese troops in Xiangtang, Shabu, Tanxincun Xu, etc., and they are rushing to complete defensive works. (May 19th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) In recent months, fierce battles have occurred in the areas of Gucheng, Dengxian, Nanyang, and Fancheng, resulting in heavy casualties on both the Chinese and Japanese sides. Currently, the first line of defense of the Chinese forces, namely the area of Xiangyang, Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai, has been reinforced with fresh troops, who are cooperating with the southern route to form a semi-circular encirclement of the Japanese forces. However, the Japanese rear communications have not been cut off. The Japanese seem to have given up their attempt to attack Xiangyang, as large numbers of Japanese troops are now advancing towards Nanyang, where the main force of the Chinese army is stationed. Chinese military personnel here believe that the recent change of position of the Chinese forces to avoid being surrounded by the Japanese is a cover for mobile tactics, which is a successful feature of the second phase of the war. (May 20th Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Nanyang - On the morning of the 18th, Japanese troops from Xinyang attacked the west bank and were repelled by Chinese forces, who killed more than a hundred of them.

On the morning of the 19th, the fresh Chinese reinforcements had stationed in Zaoyang County and claimed they would press extremely towards Suixian. Local defense forces in the Wan territory are deploying along the Henan-Hubei border, and the Nanyang market has recovered. (May 19th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Gulangyu Incident and the Shanghai Question</h3>
<p>At a time when the Shanghai issue was gradually intensifying, the Gulangyu landing incident occurred first. As the Gulangyu situation became clearer, the atmosphere in Shanghai also seemed to ease. The subtle harmony between the two places was applauded by world opinion. This was due to the concerted action of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. The treatment was effective, so a good start led to success.</p>
<p>A synthesis of the opinions of various countries' newspapers on the Gulangyu and Shanghai issues generally believes that the Gulangyu incident occurred simply for the sake of the Shanghai issue. The Gulangyu incident itself has little significance. For Japan, it was merely a probe; for the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, it was merely an exercise. The object of the problem, however, is Shanghai. Originally, the attitudes of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States toward the Far East disputes were gradually converging, seeking to deal with them jointly. From consistent forbearance, they transformed into consistent strength; from parallel negotiations, they transformed into joint action. This inside story has never been formally expressed by the authorities of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, let alone openly publicized. However, the clues revealed, from hidden disclosures to becoming an open secret, how could Japan not have heard of them? It is a pity that for several years, international actions centered on the United Kingdom have often given rise to great misunderstandings. That is, all of Britain's so-called determination, due to the slowness and softness of its actions, has led people to doubt that its determination is merely an empty gesture. If it is truly determined, everyone will know what to fear. If it is merely an empty gesture, then everyone can insult it. With Japan's soaring desires, it would naturally not be moved by empty gestures. Seeing the deep interests of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in Shanghai, it was also feared that they would not be willing to silently give it away. Hence, the probe in Gulangyu. And the United Kingdom, France, and the United States also conducted a preliminary exercise for consistent strength and joint action. If the joint notice issued by the two concessions in Shanghai in recent days, as well as the exercise of martial law, have the same meaning, it is merely a concrete and small-scale version.</p>
<p>What the United Kingdom, France, and the United States performed in Gulangyu was: first, parallel protests; then, the joint landing of the naval infantry of the three countries. Now, the number of naval landings by the three countries maintains an equal relationship with Japan. Thus, when the three countries are added together, they are three times the Japanese forces. In this way, the determination to maintain absolute superiority is indeed expressed in terms of quantity. Is this expression of determination for the sake of the small island of Gulangyu? To be honest, if Shanghai had not reached a serious stage, the three countries would not have abandoned their attitude of compromise toward the Gulangyu incident. The three countries abandoned compromise and showed determination, which was actually promoted by Japan. The spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said: "Last year, Japanese marines patrolled Gulangyu for two months, and the various countries did not raise any negotiations or protests, nor did foreign warships send sailors to land." These few words seem to be Japan criticizing the excessive actions of the three countries, but in fact, they are the best explanation for the increasingly proactive attitude of the three countries and the connection between the Gulangyu incident and the Shanghai issue.</p>
<p>Now that the situation in Gulangyu has become clearer, let's re-examine the situation in Shanghai. Since May 3, when the Japanese government submitted a memorandum to the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the Shanghai International Settlement, the situation, which has been tense and relaxed for several months, has once again reached a very serious stage. Every Shanghai citizen feels that the situation is precarious and does not know how it will change. However, at this time, the United States and British governments are maintaining close contact, preparing to jointly respond to Japan's demands. The authorities of the concession are doing their best to use restrictive methods to prohibit all political activities of the residents within the concession, in an attempt to ease the atmosphere and reduce Japan's excuses. After a considerable period of time, the preparations of all parties have been roughly completed. Then, on May 17, the same day that the naval forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France jointly landed on Gulangyu, the United States government took the lead in formally notifying Japan, rejecting all demands regarding the Shanghai International Settlement, and also demanding that Japan return the area north of the Suzhou Creek to the management of the Municipal Council. On the 19th, the British government also sent a reply with the same attitude as the United States to Japan, and solemnly stated that the United States and the United Kingdom are taking complete cooperation on the Gulangyu and Shanghai issues. In this way, after half a month, the gloomy climate in Shanghai suddenly had the appearance of spring clouds unfolding.</p>
<p>The development of the Shanghai issue not only has the effect of turning danger into safety for Shanghai itself, but also reveals the light in the entire Far East situation from now on. The joint action of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Shanghai or Gulangyu can be said to be the prototype of the Far East collective security organization. Japan is gradually becoming unfavorable in the military against China and is now turning to consolidate its power in the occupied areas and intensify the exclusion of European and American interests in China. Now it suddenly encounters a strong and consistent joint resistance from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and it will inevitably feel deeper embarrassment.</p>
<p>Worldly sentiment applauding is a reaction to the suffering. According to the actual evolution of the far-reaching global situation, it is not enough to applaud suddenly. First, the source of disaster lies in the desire for aggression. Up to now, the desire for aggression is curbed by China's resistance, and then curbed by the increasingly tough turn of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, so that the desire has its limits from now on. However, it is not enough to make it change its plans completely, so the source of disaster still exists. Second, taking Gulangyu as an example, although the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have made it safe again, its nature belongs to the post-incident disinfection work. Such as the bullying of foreigners and the arrest of Chinese at the time, there is still no remedy. From this, we can infer that any other place outside of Gulangyu, even if patching things up after it's too late everywhere, already has patchy scars. Therefore, if we don't hurry up and catch up, strictly enforce the law, and take effective prevention and effective punishment, we will see the pain of losing sheep everywhere. Third, taking Shanghai as an example, we absolutely support the Shanghai Municipal Council exercising all management powers within the concession. However, if the Far East problem is not solved one day, the foundation of Shanghai will not be stable for a day. To seek a solution and to seek stability, we need further proactive action from the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Shanghai needs internal peace and tranquility, and even more so, it needs peace throughout the world!</p>
<h3>Great Battle in Northern Jiangxi: Over Ten Thousand Japanese Troops Annihilated</h3>
<p>(Changsha) The war situation in northern Jiangxi has been improving since the Chinese forces began a full-scale offensive against the Japanese troops at the beginning of last month. In the past ten days, the Chinese forces on the left flank have successively captured Gaoan, Gao You City, Xiangfu Guan, Phoenix Mountain, and Yaqiu Mountain, besieging Fengxin City three times, and once occupying Zhanggongdu. Among them, the two battles near Gaoan and Phoenix Mountain (5 kilometers south of Fengxin) were the fiercest. Japanese casualties were each at</p>
<p>More than three thousand</p>
<p>Three senior Japanese military officers were killed: Suzuki Takakazu, captain of the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Independent Mountain Artillery Regiment, and five were captured alive. A total of eight Japanese field artillery and mountain artillery pieces were seized, along with more than two hundred unused poison gas canisters, more than thirty other military documents and supplies, and countless rations. The Chinese forces on the right flank attacked the troops twice and</p>
<p>Entered the city of Nanchang</p>
<p>and engaged in fierce battles inside and outside the city with Japanese forces. Japanese casualties reached more than three thousand five hundred. Later, the Japanese army rushed to reinforce, and the Chinese army retreated from the suburbs in an orderly manner after the goal of annihilating the enemy had been achieved. As for the troops crossing the Jinjiang River on the front, they successively captured Dacheng, Wanshou Palace, and Shengmi Street, and once advanced to Niuhang and Lehua Railway Station, disrupting Japanese rear communications and connections, which has been effective. In summary, the total number of Japanese casualties in this offensive in northern Jiangxi</p>
<p>Should exceed ten thousand</p>
<p>and its morale and quality are getting worse. The anti-war atmosphere is becoming increasingly high. In the diaries of the captured Japanese soldiers, they are all full of phrases such as "I have only received two months of military training and was conscripted to the China front. How can I fight this war?" and "Guarding the front line in southern China, looking at the sky, I think of my family, and my head droops." As for the Chinese forces, the reporter followed a certain unit across the Jinjiang River to the front line and witnessed the Chinese forces in a</p>
<p>Proactive position</p>
<p>The military strength and firepower can be used flexibly, and the Japanese army is surrounded and annihilated everywhere. Therefore, the strong morale is unprecedented. Other aspects, such as the relationship between the military and the people, are also more harmonious than before. Along the way, rest stations and tea supply stations for wounded soldiers have been widely set up. The subsequent transport of wounded and sick officers and soldiers, as well as the supply of ammunition and rations to</p>
<p>Forward-line replenishment</p>
<p>are regulated by post stations, and transport teams and stretcher teams are organized by each county to carry to and fro in an orderly manner. However, the most difficult thing at the moment is the lack of medical and health materials. As the weather gets hotter in the future, the front line of combat is prone to disease. It is hoped that all sectors will start donating and provide practical and effective assistance. (May 19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Decides Not to Join German-Italian Alliance; Will Only Provide Spiritual Support; Striving to Avoid Antagonizing Democratic Nations; Right-Wing Military Personnel Express Dissatisfaction and Attempt to Overthrow the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the meeting of five ministers has made a final decision regarding Japan's policy in response to the new European situation. The participants were Prime Minister Hiranuma, Minister of the Army Itagaki, Minister of the Navy Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, and Finance Minister Ishiwata. They held an emergency meeting from 9:00 AM to 11:40 AM. The Prime Minister then entered the palace to report the results of today's meeting to the Emperor. He also notified other cabinet members of today's decision and convened the cabinet councilors for an emergency meeting this afternoon. At that time, the Prime Minister will ask for a joint passage of the final decision made in this morning's meeting. After this morning's meeting, Cabinet Secretary General Ota issued a statement, saying that the five ministers had reached a common understanding. He also stated that the meeting was held in the Prime Minister's residence. After the Army and Navy ministers expressed their opinions one after another, the Foreign Minister reported on the latest developments in the European situation. Subsequently, the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, and Foreign Minister frankly discussed their opinions. The atmosphere was quite tense during the meeting, but in the end, an agreement was reached on Japan's basic policy towards the new European situation. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Japan has decided on its final policy regarding European events. This matter was announced after a meeting of five ministers. Currently, the ministers are still refusing to disclose the content of the new policy. However, it is understood that the new policy is not related to the German-Italian military agreement. According to the new policy, Japan will maintain neutrality while expressing sympathy for the Axis powers and providing moral and other forms of assistance. However, it will not participate in any actual military agreements. This policy has been approved by the cabinet, and there is no need to convene another Imperial Conference to decide on it, as the Emperor has already approved it. This indicates that internal opinions on procedures have been resolved. Cabinet members believe that since Japan has not joined the Axis military agreement, it may be able to avoid antagonizing democratic nations. If so, this decision will facilitate a swift resolution to the Sino-Japanese War. Furthermore, former Prime Minister Konoe also attended the cabinet meeting. It is also understood that Japan's new policy includes, on the one hand, a limited military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy specifically to counter the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Japan refuses to conclude a military agreement with all European powers to counter democratic nations. According to this decision, there will be a major impact on both Europe and Japan, as many figures in the Japanese military and right wing are striving to conclude an unrestricted military agreement with Germany and Italy. The Japanese government has indicated that this new policy will be largely accepted by the Axis powers, as it is better than nothing at all. A portion of the Japanese army is still advocating that Japan should conclude an agreement with Germany and Italy to deal with democratic nations. Rumors say that they may attempt to overthrow the cabinet because of this. However, the Japanese Navy supports avoiding participation in European events. Based on Germany's suggestion, the Japanese Navy should assist the German and Italian fleets in operations in the Mediterranean. It is understood that the Japanese Navy strongly advocates limiting its activities to the Far East and avoiding immediate naval warfare with Britain, France, or the United States.

On May 18th, Major Nakayama attended a reception in Changsha and reported on the current situation of the Japanese army in China. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Situation of the Japanese Army in Zhenjiang; Wounded Soldiers and Corpses Constantly Transported In; Puppet Organization Tax Collectors Extort Money on the Road; Guerrilla Forces in the Suburbs Are Powerful</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence The Japanese army stationed in Zhenjiang is constantly being transferred to various places, and its number has decreased to four or five hundred. In addition, there are more than 300 puppet pacification troops. The Japanese army feels its strength is empty, so every day, one tank and dozens of Japanese soldiers patrol back and forth along the road by the river, in order to create a false impression of strength.</p>
<p>Japanese wounded soldiers and corpses from the Jinghu Line and various parts of northern Jiangsu have been continuously transported to Zhenjiang recently. The Japanese army's rear hospital is already full. The Japanese army's special service department in Zhenjiang and the puppet "Dantu County Clinic" have also recently been borrowed by the Japanese army to treat wounded soldiers. The hospital occupies the Zhenjiang Normal School Affiliated Elementary School in Bayi Lane. The buildings are quite spacious, but they still feel insufficient.</p>
<p>The Chinese Air Force has recently flown to bomb various places in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou in succession. The Japanese army stationed in Zhenjiang feels threatened by it. Air raid alarms have been issued frequently in the city recently, prohibiting people from passing through. However, although the alarms are frequent, there are often no signs of aircraft. According to sources, it is said that even if the Chinese Air Force is operating in the airspace far away in Wuhan, the Zhenjiang Japanese Army Headquarters will receive a report and issue an air raid alarm.</p>
<p>The Japanese side is forcing the people in the occupied areas to use Japanese puppet banknotes and military scrip, and illegally lowered the price of legal tender by two jiao per yuan against the Japanese currency. At the same time, in the Zhenjiang area, it is stipulated that all people taking the Japanese military-controlled Jinghu train must purchase tickets from the station in Japanese currency. However, the people are well aware of the credit of Japanese puppet banknotes, which only lasts as long as the Japanese army occupies the area. Counterfeiting of military scrip has also been repeatedly discovered, and disputes often arise during exchange. Therefore, faith in legal tender is increasing. Most people are unwilling and dare not use Japanese puppet banknotes. The Japanese side has been unable to do anything about this, so it recently changed the railway regulations, announcing that when people take the train, they can also use legal tender to buy tickets. Recently, a group of ronin, in conjunction with local unscrupulous merchants, organized the "Zhenhu Exchange Office" and the "Suhu Exchange Office" to ostensibly handle remittances for merchants and residents, but in reality, they use Japanese puppet currency to obtain materials from the occupied and unoccupied areas. The Japanese puppets are exhaustive in their search in the guerrilla areas.</p>
<p>The Zhenyi puppet organization previously planned to levy puppet taxes from various rural areas, but all rural areas have been controlled by the guerrillas and cannot be collected. The puppet organization's economy has therefore been plunged into panic, so it has stepped up its search for merchants and residents in the urban area, creating names such as house donations and import and export taxes to impose exorbitant levies. In addition to the establishment of puppet tax bureaus at various city gates, several puppet tax collectors have also been sent out along the river to block the road and collect "taxes." These traitors are all local hooligans and bullies, and they are even more arrogant and do all kinds of evil. Each person wears a sun armband and arbitrarily stops passers-by, extorting money. Even if they are carrying a peck of rice, they must report and "pay tax" of one or two jiao or more. If the people resist slightly, they immediately report to the nearby Japanese army, claiming that this person is privately transporting items for the guerrillas. The people are forced by the tyrannical power and dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and they all hate them to the bone.</p>
<p>The New Fourth Army and other guerrilla forces in the Zhenjiang suburbs are becoming more powerful, and most areas are now controlled by the guerrillas. The Japanese army is only ambushing in the urban and rural areas and at the stations along the railway line, but the railways and highways are also often destroyed by the guerrillas. Take the Zhencheng Highway as an example. The Japanese army has repaired it repeatedly, but it is difficult to cope with the damage. Therefore, they are angry with the residents of Jianbi, Kuzhu, and Dagang along the highway, believing that they have not effectively protected the highway, so they often use the name of suppressing bandits to go to the countryside and ravage the residents or arbitrarily extort money and goods. The people cannot bear their disturbances. Currently, the Japanese army is forcing the people of Jianbi Town to fill the Zhencheng Highway bridge in the town with bricks and stones, and the river flow and traffic have been cut off for a time. The Japanese army is now very strict in inspecting pedestrians at the city gates. Anyone suspected of being anti-Japanese is immediately taken to the basement of the Central Bank (Japanese Army Headquarters). Quite a few innocent people have been wrongly killed. Previously, a villager was carrying a can of kerosene he had purchased through Zhenjiang when he was spotted by the Japanese army, who claimed that it was for the guerrillas to burn the bridge and took him to the Japanese army's special service department for interrogation. His whereabouts are still unknown.</p>

<h3>France Makes Every Effort to Mediate; British-Soviet Negotiations Expected to Reach Compromise; France Makes Concessions to Turkey Hoping to Establish Agreement Soon; British Foreign Secretary and Entourage Arrive in Paris for Talks</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Secretary Halifax, accompanied by Markin, a legal expert from the Foreign Office, Strang, Director of the Central European Department, and Barker, Director of the Intelligence Department, arrived here at 3:30 PM this afternoon. They immediately held talks with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet to exchange views on the organization of an anti-aggression bloc. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech during the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons today has increased hopes in political circles here that a British-Soviet agreement will be reached. Gloomy news has been coming from London and Moscow from time to time, but the general feeling is that the views of the two countries can ultimately be reconciled, and France will play an important role in reconciling the views of both sides. Well-informed sources remain optimistic about the British-Soviet talks. It is said that Britain's new proposal was sent to Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky yesterday. Although this proposal did not completely satisfy Maisky, it has shown an approach to the Soviet point of view. The Soviet Union's reply in principle is expected to arrive in London tonight, enabling the two countries to move towards a compromise. If this matter is not realized, the general opinion is that British Foreign Secretary Halifax's meeting with the French government leaders here tomorrow may advance the situation. French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, External Political Secretary Weiler, and External Commercial Secretary Schaffer will all participate in this important discussion. Accompanying British Foreign Secretary Halifax will be the British Ambassador to France, Phipps, and Strang, a British Foreign Office expert on Soviet relations. This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Bonnet received Soviet Ambassador Suritz. At the same time, the French-Turkish agreement on the security of the Mediterranean and the future of Sanjak will be signed next week, as early as May 25, which is the day the German-Italian alliance was signed. At the French cabinet meeting tomorrow, a decision in principle will be made on the Sanjak issue. According to opinions here, the French-Turkish agreement will be a good omen for the success of the British-Soviet talks, as Turkey attaches great importance to Soviet intervention in the event of war. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government has now changed its strategy for negotiations with the Soviet Union, planning to consult with Poland and Romania to remove psychological obstacles in Moscow. London political figures believe that the focus of negotiations is no longer Geneva but London. Since Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin is not attending the League of Nations, all talks between Britain and the Soviet Union must be conducted by Ambassador Maisky in the UK and British Foreign Secretary Halifax. After the UK has changed to a new approach to British-Soviet negotiations, the first step is for Foreign Secretary Halifax to exchange views with French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris today. After London and Paris have agreed, the second step is for the British government to instruct its ambassadors to Poland and Romania, Luigi and Regino, to inquire with the governments of their respective countries about their final attitude towards the British-Soviet alliance. After receiving reports from Warsaw and Rome, the third step is for the British cabinet to make a final decision next Tuesday. (Haitong Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression bloc, after the government's diplomatic advisor, Vansittart, held talks with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday, the British side is now more optimistic, seeing that these talks have clarified the current situation. At the same time, Poland and Romania are also more accommodating in their attitude towards the signing of a military alliance treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Polish figures here have also stated that the alliance treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, if it does not involve our country, is fully supported by us. Romanian figures have also expressed their support, but also said that Soviet troops, under no circumstances, may pass through our country's borders. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the British Foreign Secretary's taking a new plan for British-Soviet negotiations to Paris to consult with French Foreign Minister Bonnet, has aroused great attention from political figures here. Although the content is still unknown, according to various newspapers, the British new plan is based on French proposals, making certain concessions to the Soviet Union. According to an analysis by the "Times" diplomatic correspondent of the differences between British and Soviet opinions, there are the following three points: (1) The Soviet Union advocates a three-power treaty, while Britain proposes mutual declarations by various countries. (2) The Soviet Union's treaty emphasizes military alliance, while Britain proposes only guarantees. (3) Britain proposes focusing on guaranteeing Poland and Romania, which are the first to be threatened, while the Soviet Union advocates mutual assistance to prevent aggression.

<h3>London Celebrates Air Force Day; 75 Airports Open for Public Viewing; Over 5,000 Iron Birds Perform Flight Techniques</h3>
<p>(London) Today is the anniversary of the British Empire Air Force's independent establishment as a separate department. The national celebration is grand and unprecedented. Seventy-five airports across the country are open to the public. Over 5,000 aircraft of various types participated in the performance. Minister of Aviation Wood personally took a plane to travel between the various airports to encourage the enthusiasm of the participants. Flight Captain Stanford, who previously set the world record for flight speed, emerged from the clouds in a fighter plane at a speed of 300 miles per hour. There were over 500,000 spectators at the various airports watching the performance. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Former British Foreign Secretary Eden; Strongly Advocates British-Soviet Alliance; Believes It Is an Important Factor in Preventing War</h3>
<p>(London) After British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons yesterday, former Foreign Secretary Eden succeeded Churchill in making a statement, saying that in his opinion, if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can reach an understanding, it will be a blessing for peace. The more quickly, completely, and far-reachingly the understanding can be reached, the more beneficial it will be to the current situation. He firmly believes that this is in the interest of Britain, the Soviet Union, and Europe, and the maintenance of peace depends on it. Studying this issue from the perspective of British-Soviet relations, he cannot see any reason why British-Soviet relations should conflict anywhere in the world. If there is one country in the world that has many workers within its borders, that country is the Soviet Union. Our goal is not to win, but to prevent war. The stronger the organization, the greater its power to prevent war. Therefore, the sooner a complete and thorough solution is reached, the better for European peace. Foreign Secretary Butler responded to the government, saying that he heard rumors that if there is no agreement with the Soviet Union, Turkey will not be willing to mobilize a ship or a soldier when it is invaded in the Mediterranean. This statement has not carefully read the declaration of Turkey's membership. Foreign Secretary also said that Britain is not currently considering recognizing Germany's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. Britain has stated to the Soviet Union that the British government believes that British policy is more suitable for the current environment. The British plan is not narrower in scope than the Soviet plan and is better designed to provide effective assistance where it is most needed. At the same time, Britain is now giving serious and sympathetic consideration to the Soviet Union's views, and negotiations are still in progress. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Maisky; Goes to Geneva; Detours to Paris; For a Short Stay</h3>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky arrived here from London at 9:00 AM this morning and immediately held talks with the Soviet Ambassador to France, Suritz, to explain the views of the British and French governments on the organization of an anti-aggression bloc. (Ambassador Suritz met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday, and Ambassador Maisky met with the British government's diplomatic advisor, Vansittart.) He then used a long-distance telephone to ask for instructions from his government and is scheduled to depart for Geneva tonight to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Ambassador Maisky rushed to Geneva via Paris at 10:00 PM tonight. Beforehand, he met again with the British government's diplomatic advisor, Vansittart, at 7:00 PM in the afternoon. (The two had previously talked once in the morning.) Asked about the Soviet government's proposal on the 15th of this month, namely the proposal for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, is it of a definite nature? Ambassador Maisky immediately replied that the Soviet government's basic idea is to organize a collective security system, and it is imperative to accept mutual assistance. This concept will not be changed, and other proposals are not acceptable to the Soviet Union. People close to the British government commented on this matter, saying that the British government is determined to do its best to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union and has ordered its ambassadors to Poland and Romania to inquire about the views of the governments of the countries where they are stationed on the proposal for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, and whether there are any objections. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax will hold talks with various French cabinet members tomorrow and will continue to talk with Maisky in Geneva on the 22nd of this month. The British cabinet, upon receiving the report, will hold a cabinet meeting on the 24th to comprehensively study it so as to make a practical decision. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Personnel; Maintain Strict Silence; Official Refusal to Criticize Chamberlain's Speech</h3>
<p>Moscow Regarding Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, officials here refused to express their opinions. At the same time, Moscow newspapers also maintained strict silence, and the newspapers did not publish Chamberlain's speech in a prominent position. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Feels Resentment</h3>
<p>(Berlin) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons has been commented on by semi-official sources here, saying that Britain's current encirclement policy has aggressive goals and that from this speech, it can be clearly seen that there is no war. This policy is based on the assumption that other countries are threatened by Germany, "making wild accusations and harboring sinister intentions." However, the situation has not changed as a result. In short, Britain is organizing a group to confront countries that maintain order. To date, the only regret of Prime Minister Chamberlain is that he has not yet brought in the Soviet Union. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A political critic here said today, referring to the debate on the foreign affairs incident in the British House of Commons, that the British-Soviet agreement that Chamberlain expects to be established soon will only make Moscow self-important in the eyes of Germans, just as Britain's guarantee of Poland has made Warsaw extra arrogant. The strengthening of Britain's guarantee to the three Baltic countries will only worsen the unstable situation in Europe. As for Chamberlain's remarks on the colonial issue, it is important to know that Germany's demand for the return of its colonies is not a matter of concession but a matter of right based on former US President Wilson's Fourteen Points. Germany only asks for its own colonies, and what Germany has done has never conflicted with the Fourteen Points. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Executive Council to Convene; Should Use Collective Action; to Aid China</h3>
<p>—Statement by Foreign Minister Wang—</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to convene on the 22nd of this month. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang issued a special statement, stating that the Far East crisis has a major disruptive impact on other parts of the world, and the success or failure of China's current war of resistance has a very important relationship with the position of the nations in the entire Eastern Hemisphere. The League of Nations Executive Council should not disregard this point. China's current war of resistance is precisely to safeguard the main principles of security for all peace-loving countries. For the sake of international justice, the member states of the League of Nations have an inherent obligation and responsibility to seek more effective measures in accordance with the resolutions passed on September 30, 1938, and re-adopted on January 20, 1939, in order to collectively implement the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League Covenant. China welcomes all the sympathy expressed by the nations and all the individual assistance given to China by the nations in times of emergency. However, world politicians should know that China has been fighting for independence for 22 months. At this moment, the way to help China is to take collective action. At the same time, it is hoped that the Executive Council should remember its resolution passed on September 30 last year declaring the bombing of civilians illegal. (Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council meeting is scheduled to open next Monday. Although the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union will be the most important diplomatic event around the meeting, the only major international issue listed on the formal agenda is China's appeal to the League of Nations. The Danzig issue is not included in the agenda, as everyone feels that it is not appropriate to deal with this explosive issue at this time. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax will present a section of the British government's White Paper on the Palestine issue, which has actually been decided. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan Poisons China; Opium Advisory Committee Meeting; Chinese and American Representatives Submit Reports</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Representative He Jiecai and American expert Fuller today explained to the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee the situation of the Japanese authorities encouraging illegal drug trafficking in the Chinese territory they occupy. Fuller insisted that the Japanese openly allow the existence of opium dens and secret drug factories only on the condition of paying taxes, and said that various drugs use Japanese consulates as the center of control and transport them by military trucks and warships. He asked public opinion to stop Japan's activities, calling this an international threat. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>Goebbels Attacks the Anglo-French Policy of Encirclement; Hitler Returns to Berlin After Inspecting Western Defenses</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in "People's Observer," severely criticizing the "encirclers," but believing that there is no reason for European issues to cause war. His words roughly stated that if there were no interference from Western countries regarding the Danzig issue, it would have been resolved long ago. It is indeed true that the Führer desires peace, but the word "peace" must be premised on respecting Germany's vital rights. If the "encirclers" truly want to create trouble, everyone who knows the situation knows who the culprit is. If the "encirclers" truly want to attack Germany, it would be no different than "hitting a stone with their heads." As for the Western countries' hatred of Germany, it is nothing more than fear that Germany will hinder their actions. The seizure of German colonies is the result of Western countries promoting capitalism. They plunder and oppress their territories in every possible way, and the wealth they accumulate mostly comes from fraud. As for the Danzig issue, before Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech to the parliament, Colonel Beck had admitted that Danzig should belong to Germany. Therefore, if the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States did not interfere, not only the Danzig issue but also the issue of extraterritorial rights between Germany and East Prussia would have been resolved long ago. The clamoring of Polish students and journalists today stems from the instigation of Britain and France. If Germany were to negotiate border issues with them while these radical elements exist, it would be extremely foolish. In reality, the Poles are tools of British and French politicians, and the main base of hatred for Germany is in London and Paris. Their sole purpose is to encircle Germany. Although they possess the world's strongest military equipment, National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy also have strong military equipment and can be spiritually united with the same ideology, so what is there to fear?" (Haitong Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler's inspection of the western defense works has been completed. He took a train from Efringen, Baden, this afternoon to return to the capital. He is expected to arrive here tomorrow morning. Before his departure, the Führer issued a letter to the soldiers and workers on the western front, which roughly stated: "The results of this inspection have convinced me that the western fortifications are as solid as a rock. You have used steel and cement in the shortest possible time to establish a strong line of defense for the German border. Not only are you full of the spirit of sacrifice, but you have also fully demonstrated the collective spirit of National Socialism. The entire nation is deeply grateful for this." (Havas Telegraph, 19th) Milan: Mussolini inspected border defense projects in northern Italy and arrived in Aosta today, where he delivered a speech to the local people, roughly stating, "Italy should wait for the future with a calm attitude. Our country has millions of young men who can fight, and the state can fully arm them to deal with foreign troubles. At this time of tension, we do not know what choices democratic countries will make regarding war and peace, but I dare to assert that they have already decided. Therefore, we should quietly observe the evolution of the situation, calmly respond, and never forget our important task of defending the country at any time and in any place. For sixteen years, I have rectified state affairs, and now our military strength is strong, and the people's hearts are firm, and the future is promising." At this point, Mussolini recounted the history of the Italian army's participation in the Spanish war, saying, "The Italian army has now triumphantly entered the city of Madrid." The crowd heard this and cheered loudly. Mussolini then concluded his speech by saying, "I believe you share my feelings that Italy's victory today will be immortal." (Haitong Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<h3>German-Italian Alliance to be Signed Tomorrow; Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Berlin Yesterday</h3>

<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources declare that the German-Italian political and military treaty will be signed on the 22nd of this month, and the content stipulates the establishment of three joint committees to study: (1) military issues, (2) general economic issues, and (3) wartime economic issues. In addition, there is another important clause that will stipulate the method by which Italian labor is employed by Germany in peacetime and wartime. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Franco Expresses Determination to Maintain Spanish Independence; No Economic Encirclement by Other Countries Allowed; German and Italian Troops Participate in Triumphal Parade</h3>
<p>General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the National Army in Madrid, delivered a radio address at 11:50 this evening, stating, "The civil war has ended, and we have won. I hereby assure the people of the country that all of Spain's setbacks have been overcome by perseverance. We are fond of peace, but we prioritize maintaining national dignity and independence. We are willing to work with all countries to pacify Europe, but we will not allow other countries to interfere with our national sovereignty or exploit our economic and political freedom. All of this is why we did not spare the civil war. Some people with certain important economic interests have long attempted to bind our country's independence and weaken our power. Fortunately, they have not succeeded. If they still want to use pressure to influence our national sovereignty and seek to economically encircle our country, we have seen through this trick and will never allow it to succeed. Jewish ideology would allow big capitalists and Marxists to collude and cause significant damage to our country. Now, our country's victory has shattered their plans, and we will never allow such foreign agents to infiltrate Spain and collude with despicable people to carry out their destructive tricks. In short, we live in this world not to satisfy the entertainment of a few people and personal desires. On the contrary, we must devote all our efforts to building a truly great new country. The people must realize that the time for pleasure and enjoyment has passed, and from now on, we can only contribute to the nation and work together for the future of Spain." (Havas Telegraph, 19th)</p>

The last to parade were German volunteers. Four hours after the parade began, German Commander Richthofen also ascended the reviewing stand. When the German troops marched, the radio broadcast reports of the German troops' achievements in the Spanish civil war. The reviewing stand and the streets were decorated with Spanish national flags and the flags of Germany, Italy, and Portugal, and the roads the troops passed were covered with flowers.

Since arriving in Canada, the Queen and I have been warmly welcomed and are very pleased. According to the scheduled program, I will travel through the provinces for a week, and then go to the United States for a visit. I hope that the results of this trip will give the Canadian people a deeper belief and know that they have already been united. As for my visit to the United States, I also want to be able to promote the original friendly relations between the United States and the Empire. The Queen and I recently visited France and are now coming to this land, and will soon travel to the United States again. All of this shows that the people of our Great Britain are eager to establish closer friendships with any country and any race in the world, and the whole world will be able to appreciate it."

<h3>Anti-British Slogans Found in New York; Public Dissatisfaction with British Policy in Palestine</h3>
<p>(New York) Today, hundreds of people gathered around the British Consulate here to look up at the anti-British slogans posted on the walls. The slogans criticized Britain's policy towards the Jews in Palestine. There were as many as 18 large slogans posted on the walls. These slogans were obviously posted at night when no one was around. Photographers also took films of the slogans on the walls. Some people feared that riots would occur because of this and reported the matter to the police authorities. As a result, the authorities immediately sent six teams of police to the British Consulate to prevent accidents. However, no demonstrations took place. Only a doorkeeper was seen trying to tear down these slogans. The police stood by the doorkeeper to prevent the crowd from attacking him. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Palestine issue, after the British government issued the White Paper, American newspapers and most public opinion advocated finding a solution to the Jewish problem in accordance with the declaration made by the late British Foreign Secretary Balfour in 1917. Some even vehemently criticized the British government. Diplomatic officials here are deeply afraid that this matter will cause a bad atmosphere on the eve of the King's visit, and therefore feel uneasy. Rumor has it here that American Jews will urge President Roosevelt to express to the King when he comes to visit that the solution formulated by the British government for the Palestine problem has had a profound reaction in the United States.

Earthquakes never cease throughout the year, and it has recently been gradually sinking, and there is a risk of being submerged in the sea at any time. Batangas Province Governor Cato recently submitted a report to the Philippine government, stating that the island's residents have all quickly left the danger zone.

<h3>Collective Security; European Security; No Success Without Soviet Participation; French Newspaper Commentary Offers True Insight</h3>
<p>(Paris) After British Prime Minister Chamberlain explained the situation of the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union in the British House of Commons yesterday, French journalist Gandertina recently published a commentary in the moderate newspaper "Order," roughly stating that the countries along the Baltic Sea must be made to participate in the security mechanism. We must be the target of German attacks. The Soviet Union has now provided guarantees to the countries along the Baltic Sea. If Britain and France do not follow suit, how can they hope that they will follow Britain and France to protect Romania and Poland? At the same time, if the countries of Western Europe do not directly guarantee the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union, how can they hope that they will fight for the countries of Western Europe? Not only that, according to what Britain and France guarantee, if the road to the Soviet Union (referring to Romania and Poland) is invaded, we must fight. Then, if the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland are attacked, why don't we want the Soviet Union to help? Some say that General Franco made a threatening statement, saying that if the Central Kingdom concludes a formal alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, Spain will intensify its relations with the German-Italian axis. However, it is not reasonable to say that the British cabinet changed its policy because of this threat. We must know that if the Soviet Union does not participate in the British-French group, then the promises made by the two countries to Romania and Poland will be difficult to fulfill. This should not be neglected." (Havas Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<h3>After Ningbo Was Tragically Bombed, The People's Will to Resist Is Even Stronger, Supporting the Leader to Resist to the End, Willing to Sacrifice Everything</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Since April 28th, this city has been subjected to eight waves of bombing by Japanese planes. Over 150 bombs have been dropped on prosperous commercial areas and civilian residences, destroying over a thousand houses and causing seven to eight hundred casualties. The areas around both ends of Ling Bridge, Baizhang Street, Da Dai Street, Houtang Road, Zhenqiao Road, Dongdu Road, Binjiang Road, Yaoxing Street, Jiangxia Street, and Haohe Street have been completely reduced to rubble. Civilian residences in areas such as Da Shani Street, Yanwu Street, Qianlong Cao, Baishui Lane, Shizi Street, Huxi Yuedao, and Jiangbei Yiheng Street have also been bombed. The German Cold Storage Company on Dongdu Road and the British Church in Fayuan Lane were also bombed. Although the people of Ningbo have suffered the pain of the destruction of their property, their spirit of shared hatred towards the enemy has become even stronger. Recently, Japanese radio broadcasts claimed that after continuous bombing of Ningbo, influential figures had secretly dispatched representatives to Shanghai to report the true situation and planned to launch anti-war movements. This fabrication and slander is not even worth a smile from knowledgeable people. Now, the Yin County Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Committee has issued a public telegram to the whole country to declare its position. The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, expressing its support for resisting Japan to the end. The texts of the two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Expresses Determination</p>
<p>Respectfully addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing: Ningbo has suffered as many as eight waves of enemy air raids in the past half-month, resulting in heavy losses and deep sorrow. However, the people's morale for resisting Japan has not only not wavered in the slightest due to the sense of threat, but the idea of shared hatred of the enemy has become even stronger. It is sincerely believed that resisting Japan and striving for national survival and national independence is a war in which the general public has a clear understanding early on. At this time, when the war of resistance has entered the second phase, the more difficult it is, the more we must struggle, and the closer we are to the final victory. No matter what despicable means the enemy uses, they will never be able to break the spirit of us Ningbo people in supporting the National Government and obeying the leader's united resistance against Japan. Therefore, even if we are crushed to pieces and our necks are severed, we will be at ease with it and enjoy it. We are willing to make any sacrifice. What is bombing and burning? The enemy's broadcasts in Shanghai and Wang Jingwei's repeated declarations are absurd in their wording. Even a three-foot child knows their delusion. Our 700,000 people in Ningbo have always adhered to the Three Principles of the People, supported the National Government, and obeyed the leader in the united resistance against Japan. This has been obvious to everyone for the past two years. How can there be such absurd actions as the enemy broadcasts at the juncture of survival and extinction? There is no doubt that this is the enemy's deliberate fabrication of rumors to confuse the audience. Moreover, since the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization, the National Covenant has been known to every household and sincerely adhered to by the public. Any behavior that is beneficial to the enemy as stipulated by the public covenant, anyone with the slightest bit of conscience would never dare to violate it in the slightest. Independence, struggle, and unyieldingness are the natural duties of our Chinese nation. Life and property have long been disregarded. No matter how difficult the environment is in the future, our blood-red sincerity in supporting the leader and resolutely resisting Japan will surely be tempered and encouraged, and we will never change our oath to live up to your Excellency's intention to lead the people in a united struggle to strive for national survival and national independence. I respectfully send this telegram to you, hoping that you will understand. Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce in Zhejiang Province, and the 85 directly affiliated trade associations and all the merchants and people kowtow together. Xiao.</p>
<p>Yin Self-Defense Association Vehemently Denounces Slander</p>
<p>To all newspapers in the country, transferred to all institutions, groups, and circles: The enemy's Japanese radio broadcast claimed that after continuous bombing of Ningbo, influential figures had secretly dispatched representatives to Shanghai to report the true situation and planned to launch anti-war movements. This fabrication and slander is not even worth a smile from knowledgeable people. The enemy planes, disregarding humanity, have been bombing the city for days, and innocent people have been brutally poisoned. Their despicable and cruel means are appalling. However, the enemy's bombing can only destroy the houses and property of us Ningbo people, but it cannot destroy the will of us Ningbo people to share the same hatred. The more they bomb, the more brutal they appear. The more they bomb, the more firm our determination to resist Japan for a long time. The more they bomb, the more eager we are to avenge the country. We only seek national freedom and national independence, support the leader to resist Japan to the end, and are willing to make any sacrifice. With this sincere heart, we send this telegram to you, hoping that you will understand. The Yin County Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Committee of Zhejiang Province kowtows. Xiao.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops on Hainan Island Launch Guerrilla Offensives on Four Routes; Part of the Japanese Troops Invading Qiongzhou Are Transferred to Guangzhou; Chinese Troops Take Advantage of the Weakness to Attack and Gain the Upper Hand</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Communication: Japanese troops landed on Hainan Island nearly three months ago. Initially, they attempted to occupy the entire island and did not hesitate to greatly increase their troops and launch a desperate attack. Later, as Chinese troops launched offensives against the Japanese troops on the eastern, western, and northern routes, the Japanese troops, due to insufficient strength, transferred a portion of the troops invading Hainan Island back to Guangzhou to supplement the front lines on the eastern, western, and northern routes, so their strength suddenly became weak. The Chinese troops on Hainan Island took advantage of the Japanese troops' emptiness to actively launch guerrilla warfare, and Qiongya Garrison Commander Wang Yi ordered the four guerrilla teams under his command to launch a counterattack. After receiving the order, the commanders of each region planned that the Eastern District Guerrilla Commander Yang Yonghua would lead his troops to attack Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, Wanning, and Jiaoxian; the Southern District Guerrilla Commander and Deputy Security Commander Luo Lianfeng would lead the security teams to advance into Baoting, Yaxian, Le'an, and Ganen; the Western District Guerrilla Commander and Security Regiment Commander Long Ju had also prepared to attack the Japanese troops in Danxian, Baisha, and Changjiang; the Northern District Guerrilla Commanders Feng Baiju and Liu Qinju, husband and wife, commanded more than 6,000 guerrillas to directly attack Qiongshan, Anding, Chengmai, and Lingao. Under this situation, the Japanese troops had to stop their invasion and stayed in the coastal areas to build defensive fortifications in order to defend themselves. They also actively developed Haikou, Wenchang, Yaxian, the airfield, and the Sanya Haikou military ports in the Yulin area as naval and air force bases. On the one hand, they waited for reinforcements to be sent from Shanghai, and on the other hand, they sent planes to bomb the Jiaziji City of Lehui and the Heleshi area of Wanning in the rain in an attempt to contain the rear of the Chinese troops. According to military intelligence, on the 18th of last month, the Chinese guerrillas had advanced to a certain place several miles away from Qiongshan City, attacked the Japanese troops, annihilated more than 100 Japanese troops, and seized a large number of guns, ammunition, and documents. The Japanese troops retreated to Qiongcheng and were besieged for fear of another guerrilla attack. On the same day, the Japanese airfield in Huachang, Chengmai County, was also suddenly attacked by Chinese guerrillas, and there was a fierce battle for several hours. As a result, two to three hundred Japanese troops were killed. The Japanese troops transported the dead bodies back to Hongshan Beipu near Haikou for cremation. The Japanese troops were also so ashamed that they became angry and sent several planes to fly to the villages near Huachang to bomb indiscriminately, killing and wounding many residents. The situation was terrible.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Implement Terror Policies</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Japanese troops currently entrenched on Hainan Island is located in Qionghai Middle School outside the West Gate of Fucheng. All combat strategies are issued from there. The total strength of the Japanese troops in Wenchang, Qiongshan, Ding'an, Yaxian, and Chengmai counties is three to four thousand people, most of whom are Koreans. The Japanese troops, in view of their weak strength, have recently instigated puppet traitors to organize fake self-defense teams and fake police in various places to assist them, lured local ruffians and traitors to participate, and at the same time, they have been dispatched to various villages to search and arrest villagers and drive them to the front line to supplement the vacancies. They also implement terror policies in an attempt to intimidate the people and tame them under their control. According to a visitor from Haikou, the Japanese troops have recently been abusing the people more and more. For example, the other day in Haikou City, they convened a meeting of citizens under the pretext of a general meeting of citizens, and forced the remaining citizens to attend the meeting. At that time, more than 400 people were forced to attend, but they were all detained and have not been released yet. Their lives and deaths are uncertain. The rest of the citizens were panicked and trembling with fear, and they all sought to escape. The entire Haikou City has become a world of terror.</p>
<p>The Number of Japanese Warships on the Dianzhou Peninsula Has Decreased</p>
<p>At the end of last month, as many as thirty Japanese warships of various sizes suddenly sailed to the Dianzhou Peninsula, which is across the sea from Hainan Island, and the sea off Beihai Lizhou Island. They often appeared in the Qiongzhou Strait, intercepting merchant ships and bombarding the coast. As a result, the situation in Nanlu became tense, and the situation in the Leizhou Peninsula was unprecedentedly serious. Xuwen, Haikang, and Suixi counties have often ordered the evacuation of people to deal with emergencies. However, the Japanese warships were only intimidating and did not make any major moves. In the past week, most of the Japanese warships have fled to other places. It is said that the situation in the Xijiang and Jiangmen Xinhui areas is tense, and these warships have gone to reinforce them. The Japanese aircraft carrier and two cruisers that were anchored off Lizhou Island on the 2nd of this month have also left. When the Japanese warships were about to sail, one of them sailed to Guantouling in Hechong County and Liaoxi in Dianbai County to patrol and spy, but there was no abnormal movement. There are currently very few Japanese warships in the coastal areas of Nanlu. The three counties of Leizhou Peninsula have also not issued air raid alerts. The local area is peaceful, and people's hearts have returned to tranquility. However, seven or eight Japanese warships are concentrated in Haikou on Hainan Island, and several are in Yulin Port.</p>
<p>Refugees from Various Counties Flee to Guangzhou Bay</p>
<p>According to news from Guangzhou Bay, since the situation in Nanlu of Guangdong Province became tense, the people of various counties have been withdrawing to the inland one after another. Those who are richer or have relatives doing business in Guangzhou Bay have mostly fled here to take refuge. In recent days, the refugees from Hepu, Fangcheng, Haikang, and Xuwen counties have been arriving in an endless stream, and the number is particularly crowded. The people of Qiongdao Prefecture, because they cannot bear the trampling of the Japanese cavalry, or fear that the Japanese cavalry will penetrate deeply and suffer from poisoning, have fled to Lizhou Island in Guangzhou Bay through the middle passage. The number is about three to four thousand people. Most of the refugees who fled from Qiong are very embarrassed and have nothing with them. The situation is desolate. The Xiying Branch of the Guangzhou Bay Relief Association has been trying to find ways to accommodate and provide relief in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Telegraphed the Central Government to Request Funds for Water Conservancy; The Situation of the Yellow River and Huai River Confluence Is Serious; The Most Important Projects Should Be Rushed to Completion</h3>
<p>Xinghua Communication: Han Demin, Acting Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, said that the confluence of the Yellow River and Huai River and the future water disaster in northern Jiangsu are very serious and urgently need to be rescued. However, the project requires huge expenses and is difficult to raise. He telegraphed the Central Government for funds to be used for the plans discussed with Zheng Quanbo, Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to repair the east and west dikes of the canal and dredge the ports entering the sea, and with Cheng Jingsheng, a member of the Central Relief Committee, to discuss the relief and recovery of refugees in the disaster-stricken counties, in order to proceed. The original telegram said: "The confluence of the Yellow River and Huai River and the future water disaster in northern Jiangsu are unimaginable and urgently need to be rescued. However, the local financial resources are strained, and it is difficult to raise these project costs. We hereby telegram the most important projects that should be rushed to completion and can be completed within three months, requesting that funds be allocated quickly to proceed. (1) The east and west dikes of the canal are the guarantee for the counties in the lower reaches to resist flooding. Now, from Erbao in Huai'an to Lotus Pond in Jiangdu, a total length of 140 kilometers, a total of 1.26 million cubic meters of soil, requires 440,000 yuan. In addition, more than 20 culverts along the dike are leaking water, and more than 100 places on the river dike are detached, which should be repaired immediately, requiring 80,000 yuan for labor and materials. (2) The Wangzhu Xiachuan and other five ports are silted up and shallow, and the water discharge is not smooth, and the sluice gates are also damaged, requiring 60,000 yuan for dredging. (3) The canal usually stores materials in June and sets up defenses in July. The funds used last year were 160,000 yuan, and now 100,000 yuan is listed. If there is an abnormal flood, the funds will be increased, and a supplementary allocation will be requested. (4) The first phase of the dredging project of the waterway entering the sea requires 400,000 yuan, of which 250,000 yuan has been jointly raised by the central government and the provincial and local governments. In addition to the expenditure of 100,000 yuan, the remaining funds are currently being used to continue the project. (5) The terrain in the lower reaches is low-lying. For the temporary flood avoidance of residents, the counties have been ordered to raise funds to repair the dikes and build the embankment. Items 1, 2, and 3 require a total of 680,000 yuan. In addition to the 100,000 yuan for flood prevention to be allocated in July, it is proposed to first allocate the emergency project funds of 580,000 yuan quickly in order to cooperate with the project. After consultation with the two commissioners Zheng and Cheng, the opinions are the same. If these emergency projects can be completed before the flood season, the Yellow River and Huai River will not increase before autumn, and the return to the sea will be open, and the early rice in the counties will be harvested. According to the lowest price calculation, it is more than 10,000 yuan, which is of great benefit to the people in the lower reaches. As for the Zhongyun Zhongshan Zhangfu River and other projects, after the recovery plan of Huaisi, the inspection will be done to tie the embankment and return to the sea, which is especially important. It is planned to plan after autumn, and in terms of relief, Cheng is currently consulting with the commissioner, and the provincial relief branch will use the central government's urgent relief for the water disaster in northern Jiangsu to continue to allocate winter relief funds, totaling 100,000 yuan, together with the 331,500 yuan from the International Relief Association, to allocate 35 counties for winter and spring relief, and send personnel to investigate and release. However, the disaster situation has expanded, and the number of refugees has increased. The original plan for three months of food is not enough, and the disaster-stricken county has been severely affected and needs to be given preferential treatment. It is proposed to allocate an additional 200,000 yuan to be used as a special fund for the central government to comfort the recovered counties, to be stored in Shanghai, and to be audited and implemented by this government in consultation with the commissioner Cheng at any time. Combine and explain."</p>

<h3>Aurora Museum Held Its 70th Anniversary Ceremony Yesterday; French Ambassador Cosme Attended and Presided Over the Ceremony; Open for Two Weeks Starting Today, Welcome to Visit</h3>
<p>The Aurora Museum is currently located at 221 Luban Road, founded in 1868, and has reached 70 years. The museum was originally scheduled to hold the 70th anniversary conference last year, but due to the impact of the war, it was rescheduled to be held yesterday, and the new exhibition hall was opened. Those who participated in the celebration ceremony included French Ambassador Cosme, French Consul General Baudets, the French Commercial Counselor, and more than 300 Chinese and French people. The museum held a ceremony at 5 pm yesterday and decided to open it to the public for two weeks starting today to welcome visitors from all walks of life. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Museum</p>
<p>The museum has been established for 70 years and is the only large-scale museum in Shanghai. Its history is even longer than that of Aurora University. Mr. Ma Xiangbo founded Aurora University in the 34th year of Guangxu. The museum's first founder, Han De, traveled throughout China to collect specimens as many as seven times. Mule carts, boats, and various other means of transportation from previous generations of China were used. The museum has specially made models of these means of transportation and hung them in the traveling area, which is enough to make people recall the hardships of the founder. The museum's first address was in Xujiahui, which is now the observatory. It was not until 1928 that another museum was built in Xujiahui, and it was not until 1934 that this magnificent building on Luban Road was built. The current director is Father Zheng, who is also an enthusiastic scientist with white hair.</p>
<p>Internal Equipment</p>
<p>The museum displays a total of 3 specimens, each with two large rooms. The bottom specimens are all ancient Chinese bronzes, porcelains, jades, etc., dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The second floor is animal specimens, including tigers, leopards, lions, and elephants. The most valuable is the whale specimen. The third is insect specimens, which is the new exhibition hall opened yesterday. Even mosquitoes and ants have specimens. Statistically, there are a total of 3,435 bird specimens, 6,375 animal specimens, 51,600 plant specimens, 200,000 insect specimens, and 1,300 clam specimens. There are also 2,3,000 turtle and animal skeletons, but because there are no enthusiasts and researchers, they have not been sorted out.</p>
<p>Celebration Ceremony</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day to celebrate the anniversary. All departments were newly decorated. Male and female students from Aurora University greeted guests on the spot. Chinese and French boy scouts maintained order. Many people from all walks of life heard the news and gave words of appreciation, including the Chinese Science Society, the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Central Research Institute, Jiaotong University, President Zhang of Guanghua University, and the Primary School Friendship Association of the Second Special Zone.</p>
<p>Speech by the French Ambassador</p>
<p>The ceremony was held in the new exhibition hall on the third floor at 5 pm. In addition to French Ambassador Cosme, Consul General Baudets, Commercial Counselor, and representatives of the Police Department and other dozens of people attended. Director Zheng reported the 70-year history, and then the French ambassador gave a speech, saying, "Although I have not met the founder of this museum, but looking at his photos and his history, I feel that there are two points that can be deeply believed: (1) He is a great priest who can overcome difficulties and succeed. (2) He is a great French people who have made the greatest contributions to Chinese and French culture." After the ceremony, the French ambassador visited the site and returned.</p>
<p>Visit</p>
<p>The Aurora University Museum held a celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the museum and invited guests from all walks of life to visit. The ancient objects on the first floor display ancient objects from various dynasties, including bronze chime tripods, porcelain screens, stone ancient inkslabs, and ancient toys and figures excavated from the tombs of various dynasties, as well as ancient Buddha portraits and lacquer carvings of 108 generals in the Water Margin, such as the meeting of ancient cities in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. There are many ancient objects that are not easily seen outside. The museum has many displays, including Huang Anguo of Chongming in the 23rd year of Kangxi, who has been materialized for more than 200 years. His clothes and crowns were intact at the time of burial. The museum made wooden figures to wear his clothes and display them, so that the ancient clothing system can be known. The animal and plant specimens, books, and various rooms upstairs, the animal specimen rooms, have the largest whale head, and seahorses. Hippos, elephants, rhinoceros and other skulls, and bears, leopards, crocodiles, tortoises, and birds, insects, and scales are also rare. Special strange birds and animals, plant specimen rooms, and many research crystallization products are displayed in the library. Sitting in hundreds of cities, Jia Hui, Aurora students are not shallow. The studio is well-equipped. The box frame of the Laofu camera can be seen, with a butterfly placed on the top and covered with black cloth. Using electric light, the full shadow of the butterfly on the top can be projected onto the bottom of the box, and it can be copied according to the shadow to get its true likeness. It is indeed a unique and ingenious facility for the drawing department. The founders and various teachers of the museum include Father White, Father Song, Father Bai, Father Han, and Father Zheng. They have made many inventions in scientific research. For example, in addition to the 700 species of clams found by everyone, Father Han (De) of the museum has independently discovered 572 species. Father Zheng studied the life of insects and took the males after the females laid their eggs and lived alone. It was found that even if the females left the males, they could still produce offspring alone after 44 studies. The females lived and multiplied independently. He also used equipment to do various experiments and displayed various illustrated explanations of the experience of many specimens. It is extremely ingenious. In short, the items displayed in the museum have archaeological meaning, scientific inventions, and unique and ingenious crystallization works, which cannot be fully appreciated by those who just take a quick look. French Ambassador Cosme and others attended the 70th anniversary celebration of the Aurora Museum (Photo by Jiao Chao)</p>
<h3>An Overview of Secondary Education in China (2) The Curriculum and Standards Have Been Changed to Focus on Wartime Education</h3>
<p>In terms of funding, secondary education in the past has developed abnormally, causing normal and vocational education to shrink. Previously, there were restrictions on the establishment of schools. In September 1922, the "Measures for the Establishment and Funding Distribution of Secondary Schools in Various Provinces and Cities" was promulgated, limiting the secondary school education expenditure to 40% of the total secondary education expenditure by the 26th fiscal year. The new funding for secondary education in various provinces and cities should be used to fund vocational and normal schools as much as possible. Those who fail to increase should gradually reduce the equivalent amount of secondary school funding from the original funding to expand vocational and normal education. As for the distribution of the current expenses of each secondary school, salaries should not exceed 70% at most, equipment should account for at least 20%, and office expenses should not exceed 10% at most. The expenditure of secondary school funding should strive to be economical and realistic, and the entire revenue and expenditure situation must be publicly and meticulously audited by the Funding Audit Committee.</p>
<p>The regulations on the funding of private secondary schools stipulate that the start-up fee for senior high schools must be 50,000 yuan, of which 30,000 yuan is for construction fees and 20,000 yuan is for equipment fees. The current expenses must be 30,000 yuan. The start-up fee for junior high schools must be 35,000 yuan, of which 20,000 yuan is for construction fees and 15,000 yuan is for equipment fees. The current expenses must be 20,000 yuan. (Article 32 of the Revised Private School Regulations)</p>
<p>In terms of curriculum, in the 11th year of the Republic of China, the new school system was promulgated. The National Christian Educational Association formulated an outline of the secondary school curriculum, and stipulated the goals, teaching material outlines, and teaching method points of the junior and senior high school courses respectively. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the University Council promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Secondary Schools", stipulating the teaching subjects of junior and senior high schools, which are divided into compulsory and elective subjects, and generally followed the above-mentioned curriculum outline. In the 18th year, the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Provisional Standards for Primary and Secondary School Curricula", which specified the goals, teaching hours, teaching material outlines, and teaching method points of each subject in detail. In the 21st year, the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Teaching Subjects of Junior and Senior High Schools" and the "Schedule of Teaching and Self-Study Hours Per Week", revising the provisional standards into formal curriculum standards. In the 25th year, experts were re-employed to revise the schedule of teaching hours and the curriculum standards of each subject based on the implementation of secondary schools in various places. As for the evolution, the significant changes in the formal curriculum standards compared with the provisional curriculum standards are:</p>
<p>"Junior High School" (1) The teaching volume of each subject cancels the credit unit system and changes to the hour unit system. (2) The Party Ideology subject is changed to the Civics subject, and the Three Principles of the People are permeated in the Chinese, history, and geography subjects. (3) It is determined that English is a three-year course, and the elective method in the third year is abolished. (4) Science teaching adopts a subject-based system. (5) Change handicraft to labor subject. (5) Cancel elective vocational subjects.</p>
<p>"Senior High School" (1) The teaching volume of each subject cancels the credit system and changes to the hour unit system (2) Change the Party Ideology to the Civics subject. (3) Cancel elective subjects. The more important points of the revised curriculum standards compared to the formal curriculum standards are:</p>
<p>"Junior High School" is (1) reducing the total number of teaching hours per week to ease the burden on students. (2) Revising the labor course. (3) Determining the status and hours of vocational subjects. (4) Canceling the regulations on self-study hours.</p>
<p>"Senior High School" is (1) reducing the total number of teaching hours per week. (2) Starting from the second academic year, stipulating the method of mathematics grouping, stipulating vocational subjects. (3) Setting up home economics subjects for girls. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Graduation Certificate Sample; China Education Federation Notifies All Schools to Follow</h3>
<p>Time flies, and summer vacation is approaching. There are many graduates from secondary schools in this city this summer. Regarding graduation diplomas, according to the current regulations of the Ministry of Education, each school will temporarily issue a graduation certificate. However, in the past, the certificate was printed by each school, resulting in different styles. In view of this, the Teachers' Union of Secondary Schools in this city decided to notify all secondary schools that the graduation certificate for this year will uniformly use the one issued by the Zhengzhong Bookstore, because the style published by the bookstore is in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education and is very elegant.</p>
<h3>The Two-Guang Difficulties Relief Association Suspended the Admission of Orphaned Children to Hong Kong Due to Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>According to news from the Cilian Relief Association yesterday, the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai and the Two-Guang Refugees Relief Association had established large-scale orphan schools in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau with the Zhenhui in Guangdong Province, and originally planned to send orphaned children from this city to Hong Kong to study, but now it cannot be realized due to financial problems. It has been decided to suspend the handling.</p>

<h3>Both Concessions Return to Normalcy: Emergency Alert Removed, Showing Good Results and Sufficient Police Force. No Robberies Occurred During the Alert.</h3>
<p>The authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement suddenly implemented an emergency alert late the day before yesterday, rapidly deploying barbed wire and closing off non-essential roads and alleyways at the boundary between the two concessions. At the same time, British and American troops stationed in Shanghai, White Russian mercenaries, and Chinese and foreign police officers from various police stations were all mobilized to patrol the streets and check pedestrians. On the French Concession side, all police officers were mobilized to search shops and residences within the concession. In addition, the French military authorities dispatched 200 sailors to reinforce the Tudouwan Catholic Church area. The tense situation was only seen after the August 13th Shanghai Battle Memorial last year, leading to various speculations and widespread panic among the general public. However, since yesterday morning, the emergency alert measures taken by the two concessions have been quickly removed. The British, American, and French forces and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have all been demobilized, and traffic in all areas has returned to normal. It is understood that the emergency alert taken by the concession authorities was to demonstrate their determination to protect the order and tranquility of the concessions, and to issue a serious warning against any political activities attempting to disrupt the concessions. At the same time, it served as a test of preparedness for implementing alerts when necessary. Chinese and foreign citizens alike have expressed their deep admiration for the authorities' determination to maintain public order and the excellent results of their rapid mobilization.</p>
<p>Continental Daily Reports</p>
<p>After being under emergency alert throughout the two concessions for 24 hours, the patrol officers were ordered to remove the barricades at 12:30 AM this morning (20th). The US Marines and British patrol squads also withdrew at the same time. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the International Settlement Special Police were also ordered to demobilize. The authorities' taking of this extraordinary step has caused rumors to spread throughout the city, but none have been confirmed. Yesterday passed peacefully</p>
<p>with no unexpected incidents. The rumor that guns and ammunition were being transported from Pudong through the French Concession into the International Settlement was also one of the reasons for the joint military and police action taken by the International Settlement yesterday. As of late last night, no unfortunate incidents occurred, and no guns were seized. Although hundreds of suspicious individuals were taken to various police stations for questioning, they were only detained for questioning, but none were arrested. According to reliable sources, yesterday's military alert</p>
<p>was not just a "practice alert." In recent months, the number of crimes has increased sharply, especially acts of violence. Armed gangs have increased daily, and armed robbery cases have been frequent. The pistols and hand grenades in the hands of these thugs also seem to be increasing daily. The police authorities heard rumors of firearms being smuggled into the International Settlement and decided to stop the criminal activities without prior warning, implementing a</p>
<p>severe step</p>
<p>yesterday morning. The authorities had planned this alert for several days but kept it a secret. Even the patrol officers of the police department only learned of the mobilization when they received orders on Thursday evening. From midnight on Thursday to early this morning, there were no reports of armed robberies. Given that there were three or four armed robbery cases every day in the previous weeks, yesterday's display of police force had some good effects. The French Concession conducted searches but did not seize any guns, and no one was arrested. Although some suspicious individuals were detained for questioning, they were soon released.</p>
<h3>Four Newspapers Suspended: Concern from Colleagues in the Industry; Deep Hope for Early Resumption</h3>
<p>Colleagues in the Shanghai press have expressed their deep concern and sympathy for the penalties imposed on four newspapers, the Wenhui Bao, the Yi Bao (Translator), the Da Mei Bao (China Press), and the Zhongmei Ribao (China Daily News), and hope that the four newspapers can obtain understanding and resume publication and distribution as soon as possible. The North China Daily News stated that it called the editorial department of the American-owned Da Mei Bao this morning (20th) to inquire. A Chinese staff member replied, "Of course, we are working now. The Da Mei Bao will be published as usual today. Although we don't know if we can sell it, we will work as usual today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow." At the same time, yesterday all day and this morning, a large number of French Concession patrol officers and a Chinese police officer were stationed</p>
<p>on Rue de la Cathédrale</p>
<p>at the entrance to the printing press, watching people leaving the printing press and checking the clauses and newspapers they were carrying out, ensuring that no Da Mei Bao was taken out yesterday. The registration certificates of the Da Mei Bao, the Zhongmei Ribao, the British-owned Yi Bao, and the Wenhui Bao were revoked by the Public Works Department and the British Embassy on Sunday afternoon, respectively. Although the other three newspapers stopped printing yesterday, the Da Mei Bao was published as usual, but yesterday morning, its sales were</p>
<p>prevented</p>
<p>. A large number of French Concession patrol officers surrounded the newspaper office, preventing newspaper vendors from picking up newspapers. Late yesterday evening, the Yi Bao and the Wenhui Bao had contact with each other. It is said that the publishers of the two newspapers will still suspend publication, waiting for the British Ambassador to China, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the next few days, so that they can directly negotiate with the British Ambassador and have the ban lifted. The editorial and printing departments of the Zhongmei Ribao have been closed, and it is clear that the publisher has decided to wait for</p>
<p>future developments</p>
<p>. When a reporter asked a senior official of the Public Works Department yesterday about the length of the ban, he did not say anything. However, it is generally believed that, as far as the two American-owned newspapers are concerned, they will be allowed to re-register by June 1st. The two British-owned newspapers may be allowed to re-register with the consulate on the same day, but this could not be confirmed yesterday. Yesterday's front page of the English-language Da Mei Evening Post</p>
<p>published an editorial</p>
<p>reprinting a letter from the publisher and editors to the US Consul General, strongly protesting the treatment they received and urging him to immediately request the French Consul General in Shanghai to immediately and permanently cease all activities by the French Municipal Council or the French Consulate against the newspaper, and to demand compensation for all losses suffered by the publisher due to the "violation of American commercial rights."</p>
<p>French Newspaper Records</p>
<p>According to the French-language Journal de Shanghai on the 20th, it is reported that after the Da Mei Bao's license was revoked by the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, the newspaper continued to publish. When the French police learned of this, they waited in front of the newspaper's printing press on Rue de la Cathédrale,</p>
<p>prohibiting its sale.</p>
<p>At that time, 16 copies of the Da Mei Bao were confiscated. Afterwards, the newspaper authorities went to the US Consulate to request that a protest be lodged with the French side. However, it has been found that the French police's actions were in cooperation with the Public Works Department of the International Settlement. Since the newspaper's license had been revoked, it was not allowed to be sold within the two concessions. It is reported that after the joint notice was issued by the authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession, a cooperative attitude would be adopted in maintaining public order.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Industry Asks French Authorities to Help Open up Sources; Meat Industry Throughout the City Resumed Business Painfully Yesterday Morning; Vendors Buying Pigs to Shanghai Demand Guarantees</h3>
<p>The fresh pork industry accepted the advice of the concession authorities and resumed business the day before yesterday. After weighing and selling the remaining pigs, the slaughterhouses resumed slaughtering. The fresh meat industry resumed business yesterday morning. The Fresh Pork Industry Association sent representatives to the concession authorities again yesterday to explain the process in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Resumption of Business at Stores</p>
<p>The fresh pork industry resumed business on the 19th. After selling the remaining pigs, the slaughterhouse in the French Concession and the Suxi Slaughterhouse and the Xinninghai Slaughterhouse in the International Settlement resumed slaughtering the night before yesterday. From yesterday morning, all 2,000+ fresh meat stores and meat stalls throughout the city started selling. The meat stalls that had been forced to close down earlier have all resumed business yesterday morning. The market price of meat has stabilized. Wholesale price is two catties per yuan, retail price of leg meat is 1 catty 8 liang per yuan, and pork belly is 1 catty 10 liang per yuan.</p>
<p>Explaining the Process and Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Association sent representatives to the French Municipal Council again yesterday morning to explain the process of accepting the advice and painfully resuming business, and requested assistance in opening up sources to maintain the meat supply in the Shanghai concessions. It is reported that the number of pigs transported to Shanghai from Jiangbei Xingang by German, Italian, and Japanese merchant ships in recent days is limited and insufficient to meet the daily demand. Currently, vendors are trying their best to open up sources, but they demand guarantees from the concession authorities to avoid being detained and suffering losses for no reason.</p>
<h3>Peace Memorial Tower Maintains Solemnity: Improved Methods for Beat Police, to Be Tested for Three Months First</h3>
<p>The United Association of Participants in the European War had criticized the conditions of the European War Peace Memorial Tower on the Bund to the Public Works Department, saying that if it was necessary, it could be surrounded by a fenced railing to maintain the tower's solemnity. The Bureau improved the beat police methods there, and the Public Works Department undertook the tower's cleanliness maintenance work. Because building railings and installing gates would cost 1,500 yuan, the budget for this year did not include this item. The Association has now sent a letter to the Bureau expressing its gratitude for the measures mentioned above. A Bureau director said that building railings and gates might detract from the tower's appearance. Therefore, the Bureau decided to continue the above-mentioned methods for three months. If there are no results by then, it will reconsider whether to build railings and gates.</p>
<h3>Gambling Dens under Japanese Protection Expand to Concessions: At Least Three New Ones; About Twenty Others on Various Roads: Vice Spreads Gradually from the Western District to the Concessions</h3>
<p>The China Weekly Review reports that gambling dens under Japanese protection in the "badlands" of the Extra-Settlement Roads area have begun to expand into the International Settlement in recent weeks. At least three new gambling dens have been established, two on Hart Road and one, the Asia Club, at 65 Gordon Road. The gambling den near 368 Hart Road is run by Chinese who operate "Hollywood Paradise I," and another one at the corner of Hart Road and Edinburgh Road is almost independent. In addition, there are also gambling dens</p>
<p>on Extra-Settlement Road, Connaught Road, Brenan Road, Avenue Ferguson, and the Extra-Settlement village,</p>
<p>about twenty in total, completely within the International Settlement. The new gambling den on Gordon Road is said to be the most profitable, earning as much as 40,000 yuan a night. These gambling dens are all run by Chinese who have close ties with the Japanese Special Service Agency and are protected by it. The Gordon Road and Hart Road gambling dens are run by Mr. Wang, a Cantonese,</p>
<p>a shareholder of Hollywood Paradise</p>
<p>. The gambling den at the corner of Hart Road and Edinburgh Road is set up by Mr. Li, and the manager, Mr. Liu, is said to be Korean or Taiwanese. The Japanese Special Service Agency, which guarantees the protection of these gambling dens, has an office near the corner of Extra-Settlement Road and Caina Road, headed by a Japanese named Fujino. There is a Japanese treasurer in the Gordon Road gambling den, and half of its profits must be handed over to the Japanese side. It is unknown if other gambling dens</p>
<p>pay protection fees</p>
<p>to the Japanese Special Service Agency. The Japanese not only guarantee that the Chinese who run gambling dens will not be interfered with by the police of the International Settlement, but they also guarantee that gamblers will not be arrested or interfered with when they return home after curfew. Since the Japanese army occupied the Shanghai area, the vice that has come with it is not limited to gambling dens alone. The North China Daily News has published the names of 34 opium dens, all located</p>
<p>outside the jurisdiction</p>
<p>of the International Settlement and the French Concession. It is reported that these opium dens all have licenses from the Japanese Special Service Agency and pay a monthly fee of 600 yuan. Four more opium dens were opened last week. The development of these vices in the Extra-Settlement Roads area and their spread into the International Settlement will naturally have a negative impact on the concessions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Currency Falls Again Yesterday; Value of Bank of Korea Currency Also Falls Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press Evening Post reports that the characteristic of the foreign exchange market this morning (20th) was the continued decline of the Japanese yen, worth only 95 cents in legal tender. Exchange shops on Sichuan Road are now buying Japanese Bank notes for 94.80 yuan in legal tender per 100 yen and selling Japanese gold for 95.30 yuan in legal tender per 100 yen. The value of Bank of Korea notes is usually lower than that of Japanese Bank "old head" notes, and it also fell in price today.</p>
<h3>US Submarine Tender Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The US Asiatic Fleet submarine tender "Canopus" arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 AM yesterday from Manila. The ship plans to stay in Shanghai for ten days before sailing to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>American University Club Fetes Admiral Yarnell; Thanks Yarnell for His Service During Shanghai War; Presents Flag Embroidered with Latin Inscription</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that 300 members of the American University Club entertained Admiral Yarnell last night (19th) at the American Club to bid him farewell. Club President Bassett raised a glass to Yarnell's health and thanked him for his service in Shanghai during the Shanghai War, and presented Yarnell with a flag embroidered with a Latin inscription. Many prominent figures in the city were present, such as Chairman of the Public Works Department Finkler, Dong Yuanludeng, former Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji, US Attorney for the China Court Hale Mick, and US Consul General Gauss. Admiral Yarnell has been in China since 1936, serving as Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet. He is scheduled to return to the United States at the beginning of next month.</p>

<h3>Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Resolves to Dissolve Itself Due to Limited Power and Lack of Effectiveness; Ongoing Work to be Handled by Various Groups; Rice Market Situation Gradually Tending Towards Peace Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, in view of the soaring rice prices in the city, rampant under-the-table dealings, transitioning from secret to open, and the chaotic market situation making it impossible to enforce price limits, and also because requests to the authorities of the two concessions for a proper solution were not met with a definite response, held its fourth resolution meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. It was resolved to dissolve itself, and all subsequent work to be transferred to various rice industry groups for handling, and letters will be sent to the authorities to report the process. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation Committee Resolves to Dissolve Yesterday</p>
<p>The city's Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee specifically held its fourth resolution meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Silk Industry Building on Jiujiang Road. Representatives present included Pei Yunqing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Evaluation Committee members Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Zhaoqi, Zhang Songtao, Huang Ruyuan, Pan Jibin, Chen Ziyi, Zhang Nianxuan, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Jiyun, Zhou Zhizhen, and Lu Wenshao. Chairman Chen Ziyi reported on the process, and discussions immediately followed. Regarding the issue of the recent sharp rise in rice prices, the prevalence of under-the-table dealings, and the lack of significant results from registering rice owners, the committee (resolved) that since its establishment, it has handled all kinds of work to the best of its ability, but due to limitations of power and constraints of the situation, it has not been able to achieve any success. Now, the actual situation of rising rice prices and rice owner registration should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions, and they should be requested to properly consider and handle the matter well. As for the recent market price of Xian rice, because the inventory is relatively abundant and the sources are relatively smooth, it is still stable, and has less impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. This should also be stated in the letter. Regarding whether the committee should continue to exist, it was (resolved) that since the committee's work has been ineffective due to a lack of power and resources, and the authorities of the two concessions have not approved sending personnel to participate, it should dissolve itself. All subsequent work should be handed over to various rice industry groups to handle jointly, without interruption. The reasons for the dissolution will be reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the authorities of the two concessions.</p>
<p>Reporting Difficulties to the Authorities</p>
<p>After the meeting, the committee sent separate letters to the Public Concession's Public Works Department and the French Concession's Municipal Council, detailing the difficulties of the work and the unavoidable dissolution process. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, our committee, in order to balance rice prices, sent a letter on the 12th of this month presenting two matters: one was a sincere request to send personnel to participate in the organization of the Evaluation Committee, and the other was a sincere request to order foreign rice or facilitate inland sources. Subsequently, on the 19th of this month, we received a reply, which was unable to grant our request, which is deeply regrettable. Since the previous letter was sent, within ten days, the rice market situation has changed like the illusion of wind and clouds. Initially, high-priced goods disappeared, and spot goods rose sharply to the price limit. Then, under-the-table dealings re-emerged, with competitive trading exceeding prices. Finally, under-the-table dealings became an open secret, and the rising trend became more severe. Recently, high-quality japonica rice has exceeded 17 yuan per stone, exceeding the limit by more than two yuan, and indica rice is around 15 yuan, exceeding the limit by one yuan. Although our committee has earnestly admonished to strictly abide by the price limit and encouraged reporting for enforcement of penalties, those who spoke earnestly were ignored, and we were powerless and helpless. As for handling the registration of rice owners, only 20 households registered, with a quantity of 65,503 bags. Compared with the total amount of rice in storage, this only accounts for slightly more than one-tenth. It is undeniable that most rice owners have not been able to cooperate and consider the overall situation. Our committee originally hoped that handling this matter would help regulate the people's food, but now we are disappointed again. The reasons for the formation of all these situations are still the two major reasons stated in the previous letter, which will not be repeated here. As for the various tasks of our committee since its establishment, they have also been detailed in the previous letter. All that should be done and could be done has been handled one by one. However, due to limitations of power and constraints of the situation, we have been unable to achieve our wishes. As of today, what should be done can only rely on your bureau to weigh the situation and handle it well. As stated in the previous letter, we sincerely request that you approve the ordering of foreign rice and the facilitation of inland sources, or devise other appropriate solutions, so as to ensure the stability of the market and the people's food security. This is what our committee earnestly prays for. As the various tasks of our committee have been ineffective due to a lack of power and resources, there is no need to continue to exist. We have decided to dissolve ourselves, and all subsequent work will be handed over to various rice industry groups to handle jointly, without interruption. As a last resort, we hope you will forgive us. In addition, there are still things that should be clarified. Recently, rice prices have risen, although both japonica and indica rice have exceeded the limit, japonica rice is particularly high. According to the prices of these two types, the original difference was only about one yuan, but now the difference is two or three yuan. In terms of inventory, there are currently more than 500,000 bags of rice in storage, estimated to be mostly indica rice, accounting for more than two-thirds, while japonica rice is less than 200,000 bags. In terms of sources, Wuhu, the concentration point for indica rice, has now lifted the ban, while Wuxi, the concentration point for japonica rice, still prohibits the import and export of rice. The abundance of inventory and the smoothness of sources are different, so the prices will inevitably vary accordingly. It is predicted that the future trend will be different, with the difference becoming greater. The market price of indica rice can still be relatively stable, so it should not have a significant impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. Furthermore, the production price of foreign rice is gradually approaching, and transportation and calculation can gradually be combined. If orders can be placed early, the people's food security can be further ensured. This is the limited view of our committee, and it is attached to the end of the letter for your consideration."</p>
<p>Future Work to be Handled by Groups</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, the committee was created by seven groups, including the Bean and Rice Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Rice Milling Industry, Changshu Rice Industry Association, Nanbang Association, Rice Sales Industry, and Rice Transport Merchants United Association, at the second joint meeting. After its official establishment on March 15, it proceeded to investigate the city's rice inventory and limit rice prices to regulate sources, etc. Initially, the implementation was quite smooth, but recently, the rice market suddenly became chaotic, with very active under-the-table transactions. Although repeated persuasion and strict enforcement of price limits were carried out, it was helpless because the power was insufficient and the resources were exhausted, so it had to be dissolved. After the dissolution, all future work and matters to be handled will be transferred to the original rice industry groups to handle and preside over everything.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Express Attitudes</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Public Works Department's Information Office issued a message stating that the concession situation is calm as usual, and there are no difficulties with the rice issue. The city's rice inventory can last for at least two months, and the inventory of wheat and flour is sufficient and can be used for six months. Moreover, the sources of rice and wheat are smooth, so there is no concern about the lack of food for the people. The Public Works Department's Director-General, Mr. Fei Lipu, sent a letter to the Rice Industry Group Evaluation Committee the other day (the 19th), stating that the bureau deeply agrees with the matters handled by your committee, such as facilitating sources and stabilizing market prices. The bureau is paying close attention to the food issue at all times, and if there is any manipulation of the market, the bureau will definitely ban it, etc. The French Concession's Food Committee sent a letter to the Rice Industry Group Evaluation Committee yesterday, agreeing to cooperate with the police to intervene and ban underground markets. The original letter stated: "In reply to your letter of May 12 regarding the regulation of rice and grain for the people of Shanghai, this bureau has carefully reviewed your letter and, according to the situation, held a meeting with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to study this issue. According to our assessment, under the current circumstances, a very serious panic about rice and grain will not occur. This bureau will continue to work with the authorities of the Public Concession to supervise and manage this special situation. Regarding the investigation of rice prices, it is being carried out daily. If this bureau finds out that someone is speculating or manipulating the market, this bureau can cooperate with the concession police to intervene."</p>
<p>Market Situation Slightly Eases</p>
<p>Because speculators hoarded and manipulated the bean and rice market yesterday, spot supplies were scarce and there was strong demand, resulting in a mismatch between supply and demand. Underground transactions were fierce, and the chaotic market situation was rare in history. After the Management Committee made every effort to persuade and closely monitor underground markets, the market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday, and the situation gradually eased. However, underground transactions remained the same. Market prices uniformly fell by one or two jiao, but the highest price was still between 17 yuan and 8 jiao, with an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 bags traded.</p>
<p>Reporting the Chaotic Market Situation</p>
<p>In order to report the process of the chaotic market situation and the situation of exceeding price limits, the Bean and Rice Market Management Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, stating that the committee lacks a strategy to maintain it. Respectfully, since the market prices have been resolved and limited by your association, and strict penalties have been set and announced in the market, the market situation has been eased. Those who are honest and self-disciplined can still consider the overall situation, but there are probably still many who do not follow the rules. In short, the sources are lacking in facilitation, and those who seek it exceed the supply, resulting in the inevitable exceeding of the market price limit. Although no action is seen on the surface, the hidden situation is difficult to describe in detail. After repeated consultations by the committee members, it is believed that the new rice will take too long to appear on the market. If this continues, it may not be a fundamental solution. Although your association leads with painstaking efforts and meticulous care, it is difficult to implement due to the extraordinary nature of the situation. Furthermore, the current market situation is extremely serious, and the committee members are unable to protect everything. Therefore, this special letter is sent, earnestly requesting that you send personnel to preside over everything as soon as possible. If you still do not take care of it, and the market has an accident, the committee members will not be responsible. It is imperative to report this together.</p>

<h3>Rising Prices Affect the Livelihood of Laborers Fashion Industry Asks to Maintain Original Contract Lacquer Workers Appeal for Appropriate Wage Increase</h3>
<p>The rising prices in Shanghai are affecting the livelihood of the general public and workers. In order to maintain a basic standard of living, the fashion industry workers in the city signed a contract with both labor and capital in November last year, stipulating wage standards. Recently, because some capitalists in the industry have violated the contract and reduced wages, making life more difficult, they have filed a petition with the First Special District Court to</p>
<p>Mediate and Maintain the Original Contract. Also, all lacquer workers in the city have recently requested to improve treatment from all capitalists by letters after collective discussion due to the continued increase in the cost of living in Shanghai, and the current wages cannot be maintained. The original text states: "We, the lacquer workers, have always had very low wages, and it has been difficult to maintain a living. Although wages were once increased slightly in 1930, the cost of living</p>
<p>Continues to Increase</p>
<p>So it is still not enough to make a living. Recently, prices have soared, and the original wages of the workers cannot maintain the minimum standard of living. After collective discussion, we requested the capitalists to consider the difficulties and appropriately increase wages under appropriate circumstances so that we can work with peace of mind. It was resolved and passed, and a letter was sent to the capitalists requesting it on file. The workers are really forced by livelihood and have no choice but to appeal. We hope that the capitalists will follow the principle of</p>
<p>Benefiting Both Themselves and Others</p>
<p>Accept the workers' request, so that labor and capital can cooperate, and the future of business can be prosperous. Please make a goodwill decision in the near future. Labor and capital are deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>Frequent Fires in Hongkou District, Multiple Perpetrators Arrested, Japanese Side Claims Arson Group Responsible, Leader and Several Members Arrested</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports: Yesterday (the 19th), the Japanese side, when entertaining newspaper reporters, revealed that a Chinese arson squad had committed numerous arsons in Hongkou and Yangshupu, including the major fires at the NYK warehouse and the Japanese Consulate General's Police Department on March 24th. Their leader has been captured by the Japanese military authorities. Another arsonist, who set fire to the Shanghai Cotton Weaving Company's warehouse in Yangshupu on May 9th, has also been apprehended. According to a Japanese military spokesperson,</p>
<p>Arson</p>
<p>The leader of the arson squad responsible for burning the NYK warehouse was arrested on May 8th. He has been identified as Chen Xinglin (transliteration), aged 39, employed by the British American Tobacco Company's Yangshupu factory, residing on North Jiangxi Road. The spokesperson continued that the arson squad had set fire to, in addition to the NYK warehouse, the NYK's Wusong Wharf on December 22nd of last year, and also committed arson in Zhabei on March 26th. However, that fire was extinguished without causing any damage. The arsonist who set fire to the Shanghai Cotton Weaving Company factory on May 9th</p>
<p>Has Also Been Arrested</p>
<p>His name is Huang Genbao (transliteration), aged 24, employed at the factory. He has confessed to setting fire to the factory where he was employed. Chen has also confessed to involvement in the NYK warehouse fire. Regarding this fire, other accomplices have also been arrested, the spokesperson said. In response to a reporter's question, the spokesperson said that Chen was arrested on Zhapu Road Bridge. It is believed that he did not participate in the arson himself, but instructed four others to do so. Huang was arrested in Zhabei while leaving the scene of the fire. He has admitted to setting fire to the cotton mill. Chen's arson squad had</p>
<p>Political Connections</p>
<p>While Huang obtained chemical substances from someone in a tea house on Danyang Road, and was promised a large sum of money. The instigator has not yet been arrested, it is said.</p>
<p>According to a report from the news agency, buildings in Hongkou and eastern Shanghai have suffered frequent fires in the past month. The most significant was the fire at the NYK's second warehouse in late April. Subsequently, there were fires almost every day, with as many as nine fires occurring in a single day. The Japanese side then conducted a detailed investigation and determined that incendiary devices were often found at the fire scenes. Therefore, they concluded that it was an</p>
<p>Organized Arson Group</p>
<p>Conducting a systematic campaign. Recently, the Japanese side further investigated and claimed to have obtained several suspects. Yesterday, the Japanese-language newspapers disclosed the details of this incident, stating that the arson group was organized in December of last year, with a total of ten members, led by Shen Shunlin, a worker at the British American Tobacco Company. The first target for arson was the burning of the NYK warehouse. The plan was initiated on December 21st of last year, and those who carried it out</p>
<p>Included Members</p>
<p>Chen Mingkang and four others, disguised as coolies, infiltrated and completed the mission. On March 24th, Shen Shunlin personally led several members at 3:00 PM, carrying incendiary materials, and mingled into Hongkou to commit arson. On April 20th, the group split into two teams to commit arson in Yangshupu and North Sichuan Road. The former did not succeed, while the latter resulted in two members, Chen Mingkang and another, being arrested by the military police. Finally, on May 8th,</p>
<p>Shen was Arrested</p>
<p>However, on the following day, May 9th, the Shanghai Textile Factory in Yangshupu was again burned by fire. The military police arrested Wang Genbao (24 years old), a worker at the factory. The Japanese newspapers also stated that Wang secretly brought incendiary materials into the factory on that day and was arrested, and so on. This news was prominently published in the Japanese-language newspapers yesterday, demonstrating the importance that the Japanese side attaches to the frequent fires in the Hongkou district.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Rickshaw Pullers Firmly Refuse to Increase Levies</h3>
<p>There are over one thousand rickshaws in the Nanshi area. Each rickshaw must pay a license fee of four jiao per month. However, due to the limited routes for pulling rickshaws, the livelihood is meager, and it is difficult to maintain a living. In March, the license fee was increased to eight jiao per month. However, after the entire rickshaw puller community protested, it was settled by increasing the fee by one jiao to the original amount. Recently, the puppet "Transportation Bureau" Nanshi Vehicle Management Office, starting from May, demanded an additional three jiao, to reach the goal of eight jiao per month per rickshaw. However, the rickshaw pullers cannot bear the heavy tax and firmly refuse to pay it, preferring to sacrifice their business in order to resist. Furthermore, on the morning before, they sent over forty representatives to petition the Nanshi puppet police bureau, but without any effect, it is said.</p>

It is said that they will go to Chongqing via Wenzhou to take the entrance examination for the Central Military Academy, in order to further their studies and hopefully serve the country in the future. There were four classmates traveling with them. The students' families are very anxious, fearing that they are young and easily deceived.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Dies Suddenly</h3>
<p>Wang Zhongqi, a Jiangbei native, aged 45, who lived at 35 Ciyang Lane, Wuding Road, in the Public Concession, and made a living by pulling a rickshaw, suddenly collapsed around 5:30 AM yesterday when he pulled his rickshaw to the intersection of Shanhai Pass Road and Carter Road and died.</p>
<h3>Robbers Wound Victim with Gun</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiman, a Jiangbei native aged 35, runs the Hexing Tea House at Meijiazhai, Yong'anbang, Jing'an Temple Road, in western Shanghai. At around 10:00 PM last night, four robbers suddenly broke in to rob. Zhang resisted and shouted for help, angering the robbers, who immediately fired four shots. One bullet hit Zhang Zhiman in the head, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely and losing consciousness.

<h3>Husband Keeps Six Concubines, Wife Unable to Bear Abuse</h3>
<p>Husband Commits Violence in Front of Court After Divorce Mediation Fails,</p>
<p>Jiangbei woman Zhou Chen, also known as Chen Xiaobao, aged 24, engaged lawyer Wei Weiqing to file a petition with the Second Special District Court's Civil Division against Zhou Yinchun (aged 33, from the same hometown, residing at No. 8, Lane 43, Tongren Street, Xujiahui, engaged in the yellow sand and gravel business) for mediation to end cohabitation. She claimed that in December of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], she was introduced by Wang Fengsheng and Hong De and began cohabiting with the defendant. She then discovered that the defendant already had a wife, Zhu, and three concubines. Subsequently, he successively took Mu and Wang as concubines. Including the petitioner, he had one wife and five concubines. However, the defendant</p>
<p>Repeatedly Abused</p>
<p>The petitioner, fearing his ferocity, dared not argue with him. Unexpectedly, on April 15th, the defendant again took Wang's daughter as a concubine. From then on, the defendant treated the petitioner like a thorn in his side, forcing her to bow her head to the newly wedded Wang. If she slightly displeased him, she would be brutally beaten. Under such circumstances, the petitioner's life was in imminent danger, and she had no choice but to petition for mediation to end cohabitation and for the defendant to pay living expenses of one thousand yuan, etc. The court accepted the petition and held a hearing for mediation yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, after both parties arrived at the court on time before the hearing, the defendant Zhou Yinchun actually attempted to kidnap Chen outside the court to take her home, resulting in a quarrel and fight.</p>
<p>Violently Beating Chen</p>
<p>Causing her to be injured. The fight was stopped by court guards, bailiffs, and police officers. Chen then filed a petition with the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court, requesting a medical examination, and filed a lawsuit for assault with the Criminal Division. At around 11:00 AM, Judge Sun Pengxian opened the Civil Division Four court for mediation. First, the petitioner Chen Zhou, accompanied by her lawyer, stated the previous situation. The defendant Zhou Yinchun opposed the divorce, denied abuse. The court reviewed the situation and declared the mediation unsuccessful, instructing the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit. The petitioner's side, fearing that the defendant would use force to oppress her again after leaving the court, requested the court to issue a warning to prevent further incidents.</p>

<h3>Xie Daxing Dyes and Fabrics Store Sues Landlord Wei Yue for Delay in Handing Over Property and Seeks Compensation for Losses, Landlord Files Third Instance Appeal Against Tenant</h3>
<p>Xie Daxing Silk and Satin Goods Store was solely founded by Sun Zhaoming, a native of Nanhui, on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession. After the August 13th [Shanghai] Incident, due to the fall of Nanshi, the store opened branches at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Baixianqiao and at the south end of the entrance to the Great World. Because the store made considerable profits selling certain goods, the branch at the Great World was twice</p>
<p>Bombed</p>
<p>As reported in the newspapers. Store owner Sun Zhaoming planned to open another branch to expand his business. In July of last year, Sun Zhaoming, in the name of the legal representative of the Tonghe Company, rented several houses at 149 Avenue Joffre, etc., from Zhu Xueseng, owner of Chengye Real Estate Company (residing at No. 2, Lane Henri, Henri Road), to open the fourth Xie Daxing branch. Both parties signed a contract,</p>
<p>Paying Transfer Fee</p>
<p>Eight thousand five hundred yuan, and a deposit of two thousand yuan, stipulating that the property would be handed over by the end of October of the same year. If the landlord failed to hand over the property on time, he would compensate for the losses by doubling the transfer fee, etc. However, the landlord Zhu Xueseng, during this extraordinary period, with the island [of Shanghai] overcrowded, was blinded by greed and disregarded morality. After signing the contract, due to the deadline for handing over the property, he notified the tenants that the building was old and needed to be rebuilt, asking them to vacate, in order to</p>
<p>Recover the Property</p>
<p>And hand it over to the new tenant, Tonghe Company, Sun Zhaoming, as scheduled. Unexpectedly, the tenants, numbering several hundred families, unanimously opposed the relocation. Zhu Xueseng eventually hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against the tenants for eviction. The preliminary trial resulted in the landlord losing. He then appealed to the High Court Second Branch, which was also dismissed. He is now filing a third instance appeal with the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. Now, Sun Zhaoming, the legal representative of Xie Daxing and Tonghe Company, has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against the landlord</p>
<p>Chengye Company</p>
<p>And its legal representative Zhu Xueseng, for breach of contract and damages. The court accepted the petition and, yesterday morning, Judge Wu Xiaoke opened the court to hear both parties. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff rented several houses on Avenue Joffre owned by the defendant on July 5th of last year to open a foreign goods store, paying a transfer fee of eight thousand five hundred yuan and a deposit of two thousand yuan, stipulating that the property would be handed over by the end of October of the same year, and signing a contract stating that if the property could not be handed over on time,</p>
<p>Double Compensation Would Be Paid</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the defendant breached the contract and failed to hand over the property on time, ignoring repeated demands. Therefore, the plaintiff sued to order the defendant to compensate for the losses as stipulated. The defendant's lawyer admitted receiving the eight thousand five hundred yuan transfer fee paid by the plaintiff and being unable to hand over the property as scheduled, and now is willing to return the transfer fee received. There was no mention of double compensation at the time.

<h3>Suspecting Wife of Infidelity, Husband Kills Wife and Commits Suicide, Both Die</h3>
<p>Wang Ruiguan (31 years old), a Fujian native, and Wang Yuying (21 years old), a woman, cohabited at 437 Wuchang Road, Hongkou. Wang Ruiguan recently suspected that Yuying had extramarital affairs. At around 5:00 AM yesterday, the two had a quarrel over this. In a fit of rage, Wang suddenly ran to the kitchen and grabbed a sharp knife, slashing Yuying's neck several times. After being injured, Wang fell into a pool of blood, unconscious. Seeing that he had caused a major disaster, Wang immediately stabbed himself in the throat with the knife. After his suicide attempt, someone reported to the police station, which dispatched Detective No. 221 to investigate. An ambulance was urgently summoned to take Wang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but she died before arriving at the hospital due to her serious injuries. Wang Ruiguan was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment but died at 2:40 PM due to his severe injuries.</p>
<h3>Multiple Highway Robbers Caught, One Thief Turns Informant</h3>
<p>The Lao Zha [Zhabei] Police Station had previously cracked a case involving highway robbers led by Cao Fusheng, who specialized in robbing people on various roads. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation, and each was sentenced. At that time, several accomplices escaped the net. The court issued arrest warrants for them. Yesterday morning, Lao Zha Police Station detective Xue Youwen and officer Sun Dafa learned that Sun Sibao, a Jiangbei native wanted on arrest warrants, was hiding at 256 Caishi Street, French Concession. They went there with French Concession police officers and captured Sun, confiscating a Mauser pistol, seven bullets, and twenty-odd pawn tickets. Sun confessed that his accomplice, Tang Amao, was hiding in Room 213, Zhenhua Hotel, 636 Fuzhou Road. They then captured four people: Yong Shun Tang, Chen Jinfā, Wang Jīngēn, and Cheng Liángdé. However, Tang was not there. Unexpectedly, Tang was also acting as an informant for the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, turning on his own gang. He came with Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest them. Sun Sibao was thus arrested by detectives Xue and Sun and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Pu Liang, explained the process, stating that due to the urgency of the case, there had not been time to investigate the crimes, and requested permission for temporary detention pending investigation and prosecution. After questioning by Judge Su Bianfen, he ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>YMCA Seeks Milk Bottles for Refugee Babies</h3>
<p>There are over seven thousand refugees in the Dunxin Road Refugee Camp, including hundreds of infants. Ninety percent of these infants suffer from malnutrition. Some four-year-olds weigh just over ten pounds. One can imagine the rest. The YMCA (also known as the Friends Society), driven by humanitarianism, plans to provide milk, soy milk, cod liver oil, and other items at regular times each day. However, due to a lack of baby milk bottles and being unable to purchase them temporarily, they are appealing to kind-hearted people in society to donate any unused milk bottles to these pitiful infants. Please send them to the YMCA staff members Shi Hengli and Chen Shiying at Room 319, 3rd Floor, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road. Also, if any doctors are willing to volunteer to treat the refugees' illnesses or conduct physical examinations, please contact the association.</p>

<h3>Effective Remedy for Cholera</h3>
<p>A gentleman has adopted the formula of genuine cholera medicine powder left by the late famous doctor Yu Fengbin, and has been matching and distributing it with the aim of saving lives, repeatedly testing and proving its effectiveness, saving countless people. The formula is hereby made public, calling on all great philanthropists to match and distribute it, which would be immeasurable merit. If the process is deemed troublesome, or you are not familiar with the preparation, you can purchase the medicine and send a letter to Mr. Xue, care of No. 434, Zhonghui Building, Avenue Edward VII. For cash, each hundred bottles will only be charged a cost recovery of four yuan, completely covering labor costs, which is not comparable to those seeking profit. The formula is as follows: (Formula) 60 watts of dehydrated alcohol SPT Ether, 10 watts of clove oil 01. Caryoph, 10 watts of juniper oil 01. Jnniper, 10 watts of cajeput oil 01. Cajupti, 30 watts of aromatic diluted sulfuric acid Acidsulph Arom.</p>
<p>(Dosage) When the disease first appears, quickly mix one teaspoon (approximately four milliliters) with warm water and drink it. Thereafter, take one teaspoon every half hour. Vomiting often occurs after the first dose, but it is important not to stop because of the vomiting. However, in severe cases with prolonged delays and symptoms such as sunken eyes and cold limbs, a doctor must administer saline injections and not rely solely on this medicine.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>How to Be a Scientific Child</h3>
<p>— Li Guifang, Member of the 66 Children's Science Research Society</p>
<p>There is no waste in the world, only wasteful people. People who don't know how to use waste are wasteful people. In our science society, many instruments and models are successfully made from waste materials. If we don't have an alcohol lamp, we use an ink bottle to make one; if we don't have a cork, we wrap it with cotton and cloth; if we don't have a glass tube, we find a few thin bamboo tubes to replace it.</p>
<p>Children! Rely on your smart brains to come up with all kinds of ways to make useful things out of waste. Only those who can use waste deserve to be called scientific children.</p>
<p>Failure is the beginning of success. Only by not being afraid of failure can we have the hope of success. Not being discouraged and not being afraid of difficulties are the spirits that scientific children should possess.</p>
<p>Scientific children are not superstitious, do not use wishful thinking, and must pursue the truth with scientific methods in everything they encounter.</p>
<p>Children! I suppose none of you are unwilling to be scientific children!</p>
<h3>Mother's Love</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shan</p>
<p>In the depths of my heart, I often sing: In the world, only a mother's love is sincere, permanent, and great.</p>
<p>A mother's love for her children is always careful and considerate, and she is concerned about their pain and suffering. When her children are young, she always takes care of their cold, heat, and hunger without fear of hardship. Sometimes the children themselves do not feel cold, but she has already noticed that they are cold and adds clothes for them. Sometimes the children themselves do not think it is hot, but she already knows that they are dressed too warmly and changes their clothes for them.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when the children's bodies are uncomfortable, only the mother will not avoid hardship and will take care of them day and night. If the illness is serious, needless to say, her heart is very uneasy, and she hurriedly goes to ask for a doctor! Get medicine! Decoction! Although her hands and feet are busy, she will never show a tired or annoying attitude on her face, and she will always take care of them carefully, fearing that something is not complete. If she sees her children in pain, her heart is even more worried, and she wishes she could take the pain of her children and put it on her own body. Once the children's illness is cured, she is very happy, as if relieved of a heavy burden, and it is as if her own illness is cured. Ah! Great mother! She always takes the pain of her children as her own pain and the joy of her children as her own joy.</p>
<p>When the children are in school, she gets up early in the morning, regardless of the cold or heat, to make breakfast for them to eat. After going to school, she is afraid of danger on the road, so she personally sends them to school. The mother is busy with the daily food and drink. And she often thinks about what vegetables her children like? "Thoughtful and meticulous" Only a mother's love for her children can be worthy of these eight characters. On weekdays, she always urges her children's studies and behavior; and always encourages you and reminds you; she has already loved your past, she is watching your present, and she is paying more attention to your future. Ah! Mother's love is truly permanent and patient love.</p>
<p>No wonder people say: "In the world, only mothers are the happiest people." Children! How will you repay your mother's great kindness?</p>
<p>In the depths of my heart, I sing again: In the world, only a mother's love is sincere, permanent, and great.</p>
<h3>Please Go to Culture Street</h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, in an instant, it's Sunday again.</p>
<p>Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest for the week. Because from Monday to Saturday these six days, we devote ourselves wholeheartedly to our studies, and our minds are inevitably slightly tired. So we use Sunday to rest a little, recuperate our tired bodies and minds, and prepare to work harder next week.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Sunday comes, we should, in theory, relax happily and give our minds, which have been under heavy pressure for a week, the opportunity to find spaciousness and comfort. For example, go to the park for a walk and breathe some fresh air; or go to the cinema to watch educational films to increase your knowledge; or, invite a few children to your home to tell jokes and stories, which is not without benefit.</p>
<p>However, in fact, children rarely seek proper pleasure to cultivate their character on Sunday. Isn't it? If they are not crawling on the dirty ground playing marbles, they are fighting cigarette cards, gambling with poker, or rolling copper coins, and staying around the vendors' stalls, playing "Civet Cat for Prince" and "The First Bridge in the World," wasting their precious time on meaningless gambling. As a result, not only is time lost, but also spirit, money, and an evil habit is cultivated.</p>
<p>That's why, in order to prevent children from wasting the time of Sunday, the more appropriate way is to ask children to go to Culture Street! Culture Street is the Fourth Road. Over there, there are bookstores and magazine companies, such as the Commercial Press, the China Bookstore, the Beixin Bookstore, the Dadong Bookstore, the Dazhong Bookstore, the World Bookstore, the Children's Bookstore, and the Shanghai Magazine Company. Each bookstore has books for children to read. There are all kinds of books: texts, pictures, novels, stories, and even scientific and natural science books. No, everything that belongs to the academic field can be said to be all-inclusive!</p>
<p>The bookstores display those books for children to browse freely. Although the bookstores hope that children can buy one or two copies to take back after reading them, it doesn't matter if they don't buy them. As long as the children are careful when reading and don't dirty or tear the books, they are absolutely welcome and absolutely happy. When they get there, in addition to enabling friends to obtain rich knowledge, their minds and psychology will also obtain unparalleled joy. As for the considerable training that can be received in thinking, especially as expected, the reason is that there are many interesting patriotic storybooks displayed in the bookstores.</p>
<p>If there are good books to read, children must be happy to approach books, so the proposal to go to Culture Street, the children would not object. If a habit is developed because of this, it is certainly much better than crawling in the alleys to gamble, and it is not as beneficial or practical to go to the park or watch movies as it is to go to the bookstore.</p>
<h3>On the Xin'an River</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Ming Er's Refugee Diary, Part 21—After seven or eight long days, they had already left the distant Qiantang River, and had hurriedly floated past the beautiful Fuchun River in the dark night. Now they had entered the embrace of the Xin'an River. The originally flat fields on both sides—the withering dwarf mulberry trees and the green vegetable fields—had turned into layers of hills and mountains. However, on the Xin'an River, the river surface was narrower again, and the mountains and peaks in the north and south of the sky had surrounded the river and the boat tightly.</p>
<p>"The Fuchun River is very beautiful. I came to visit it once in the spring of five years ago, and it made me forget to return. I wanted to entrust my life to such beautiful nature. But I never expected that during the refugee period, although I unfortunately missed the tour of the Fuchun River, the scenery of the Xin'an River is not bad either. It is truly what is called losing the elm in the east and reaping the mulberry in the west. Our eyes are not shallow, like other people who don't even have time to escape for their lives, how can they have the opportunity to visit? After all, the autumn colors of the Xin'an River have a different flavor from the spring scenery of the Fuchun River five years ago. Our kind of refugee is full of poetry." Ming Er's father stood upright at the bow of the boat, enjoying the beautiful scenery, and he said this to Ming Er.</p>
<p>This Jiangshan boat was swaying on the calm and slightly rippling river. The blue-green river water was shallow, and it was so clear that the bottom of the river could be seen. The pebbles were polished round and smooth by the river water, just like colorful pearls, red, green, black, and white, neatly laid out, like a brocade carpet. Occasionally, one or two swimming fish chased each other under the boat, and disappeared without a trace in an instant. In the azure sky, there was not a single cloud, and flocks of two or three white pigeons were hovering high and low, as if welcoming them, a group of refugees from other lands. Sometimes they seemed tired and powerless to fall on the water, but soon they rose again. The peaks standing on both sides were arranged one after another, the big mountain connected to the small hill, the high peak connected to the low mountain, an endless number of layers. Small trees were dotted on the hills, but at this time it was the season of late autumn, the withered yellow ones were withered yellow, only the wild maples, caressed by the autumn wind and autumn rain, appeared extraordinarily bright. Looking back at the stern of the boat, the towering peaks and overlapping mountains were faintly buried in the smoke, and a misty cloud was wrapped around the mountainside.</p>
<p>In the distance where the river meets the sky, specks of sails were reflected on the mirror-like river surface, and the snow-white shadows of the sails, like jade embedded in emerald. At this time, Ming Er's body and mind were very happy, and his chest was relaxed. But gusts of breeze blew on the sails, and the speed of the boat also increased. Ming Er hated the boat for going too fast, and he couldn't carefully tour the beautiful rivers and mountains.</p>
<p>"Dad, we have been sitting on the boat for a long time, and my ankles are a little sore. Why don't we go ashore to walk around and move our muscles and bones? We can also hike and play, isn't that killing two birds with one stone? We just need to follow the boatmen." Ming Er said to his father, and his father happily agreed. So Ming Er followed his father and the other four ashore.</p>
<p>"You have to walk faster, don't delay our trip." The boat boss initially declined, but when he saw Ming Er's determination, he had to agree. But he was worried that they would not be able to keep up, so when they went ashore, he told them these two sentences.</p>
<p>As soon as Ming Er went ashore, he was as happy as a little bird who had been locked in a cage for a long time and was finally free. He stretched out his hands, raised his feet, and stretched his muscles and bones, and then quickly caught up with the boatmen.</p>
<p>Ah! How beautiful! The beauty seen on the boat is only one-tenth or two-tenths.</p>
<p>Clusters of trees, like emerald screens, were arranged on the foothills, and in the depths of the forest, several thatched huts formed a village. The winding stream flowed gurgling towards the depression, hitting the pebbles, and emitting droplets of water, shooting towards the surroundings, disappearing without a trace in an instant. Wisps of smoke drifted in the forest, shrouded like fog. The farmers in the fields were either hunched over in the fields, working hard, and the jagged Chinese tallow trees were dotted between the fields, and the blood-red old leaves were swaying in the autumn wind. Ming Er looked back and saw that the vast river was rippling endlessly, and their huge Jiangshan boat was just a drop in the ocean, insignificant, and a little pitiful. Along the way, there were either towering cliffs or a flat field, with colorful colors that were dizzying. Ming Er followed the boatmen in one breath, and the rugged mountain road, with thousands of twists and turns, high or low, narrow or wide, made him afraid to look up, otherwise, he would fall into the mountains and valleys. Ming Er's father, who was picking flowers and sightseeing along the way, gradually lagged behind.</p>
<h3>Maternal Love (3)</h3>
<p>— Te Ye</p>
<p>Mom: Yes! But only for you, only for you, only for my husband, for the children... No! No!</p>
<p>I forgot Donny, then I won't give it to you. (Silence)</p>
<p>Andre: Dad, you know mom is right. Little brother is not strong, very thin, not yet grown up!</p>
<p>George: His personality is not very strong either. He is very enthusiastic for a while, but he is terribly timid.</p>
<p>Mom: You have no right to say that at all! Donny wanted to join the army himself, he came to me, ... I didn't allow him to go. Dad: Why? Mom: Because I don't want to be left alone, I have nothing but Donny. Richard! Good sons, let him live with me! If he leaves, my life will be meaningless. Serving me, there is no one, nothing is left. Alas! Son! I really don't need to throw Donny away, can't you understand? Good! Good! You say it! Can you hear what I'm saying? (Silence)</p>
<p>Grandfather: God! Afraid they don't need you this child anymore. I'm afraid it's too late, our army has already been defeated.</p>
<p>Dad: (looking at the map): There's still time, Grandpa. If our army concentrates its forces, it will definitely be able to hold this line.</p>
<p>Peter: I now rely on our people, Dad. They are all armed, ... they are even shooting in the streets! You see! Even the children are preparing to set off! They have all picked up their father's guns!</p>
<p>Julian (looking at him): Mom, where did you put the gun you took here?</p>
<p>Mom: For Donny, I hid it.</p>
<p>Julian: There is a rifle that needs to be oiled. Dad (looking closely at the map): This is really a natural barrier, our army can hold it, - I am willing to go and arrange it myself.</p>
<p>Julian: Mom, please tell me! Where is the rifle?</p>
<p>Mom: You always want this and that. (She opens the teak wardrobe) It's here.</p>
<p>Julian: Thank you (He takes out the rifle and examines it carefully.) This is a good gun. (Then he wipes and oils the gun with a rag.) (Silence)</p>
<p>Grandfather: Hey, daughter-in-law, you can be considered to have reunited with your family here.</p>
<p>Peter: Do you hear it?</p>
<p>George: What?</p>
<p>Peter: This silence...</p>
<p>Andre: It seems like someone is about to speak...</p>
<p>Peter: Who? (They look at each other, then they all walk to the radio) Wow! I know!</p>
<p>Dad (looking up): What's going on? (He also stares at the radio, everyone facing the loudspeaker in silence.)</p>
<p>Mom: If you are willing, ... as long as you don't talk about the war again. (She turns on the machine)</p>
<p>Male voice (from the loudspeaker): The vanguard is now coming towards the river. The volunteers have blown up the bridge, and are preparing to defend the road to the last man. No matter how heavy the sacrifice, we must stop the enemy. Everyone says we are going to fail, but we will not retreat.</p>
<p>Female voice (from the loudspeaker) Hey! Listen, can you hear? Quickly mobilize the masses to fight. Mobilize all the people! Now we are not fighting for self-defense, but to protect our land for our ancestors and our children and grandchildren. In the name of our ancestors, children and grandchildren, we call on the people of the whole country to arm themselves!</p>
<p>Mom: I won't give it to you! Male voice: Hey! Hey! Listen, the Northern Army Commander reports: Our army is retreating and fighting, every inch of land, every marker on the ground, every house, has been fought over and contested. The farmers are unwilling to abandon their homes and flee, and are now defending them with guns. The number of dead is increasing minute by minute.</p>
<p>Andre: Poor thing...</p>
<p>Dad: This is the right thing to do... They are helping to stop the enemy's advance.</p>
<h3>In the Animal Realm (2)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>What he was proud of was making friends with Xiao Tang, the son of a coachman. Xiao Tang was rude and cruel, and he had also read some books, but his ability to play pranks was different from others. Peng Qi learned everything from Xiao Tang one by one. The two of them often went to see the butcher kill pigs, or helped people drown too many kittens and puppies, and they both found it very interesting. Later, they went a step further and simply learned to fight chickens, fight dogs, hunt rats, and hunt cats.</p>
<p>Peng Qi's father was a sick person, and he had no brothers, so no one came to correct his behavior and guide him to the right path. He didn't want to study and improve, but only to find pleasure in cruelty, and the more cruel he was, the more masculine he seemed. He thought that if he had a softer heart, he would not be as good as Xiao Tang, the son of a coachman, and he would be laughed at by Xiao Tang.</p>
<p>When Peng Qi made friends with such a child as Xiao Tang, there was still hope for cultivating morality and encouraging action. Because Xiao Tang was the son of a coachman, his background was lowly, so he was most afraid of going to other people's living rooms. As soon as he entered the door, he felt awkward and uncomfortable. However, when he arrived at the stable, he would talk and laugh happily. He was a famous hero among many children in the village. Every time in early summer when the wind was warm and the sun was shining, he often used stones to throw at frogs to death by the river, and he always hit the target, and he was unanimously admired by the children.</p>
<p>Having such a good friend, Peng Qi did become more and more estranged from his two beautiful little sisters with gray-brown eyes. His eldest sister once sadly said to others: "Peng Qi never puts us two in his eyes, because we are girls, but we can't force him, so we have to treat Knox as our brother."</p>
<p>Knox was a very large curly-haired dog, half hound and half Newfoundland, and because its fur was as black as night, it was called Knox. Knox was black all over, but his paws were brown, and there was a gray spot under his tail. Now the two little sisters elected it as their brother, and it deserved it. Compared with Peng Qi, it was still more like an appearance.</p>
<h3>Xier - Monday Morning Quarterback</h3>
<p>— Jing Yu</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance Cash Still Feels Over-Supplied, Transactions Still Lackluster</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market remained sluggish and weak. The situation in the timber market was gradually easing, calming anxieties. Moreover, money changers frequently sold off small lots. Silver shops and brokers also engaged in arbitrage, leading to a sluggish market. However, in the morning, a certain gold firm (acting on behalf of speculators who were again increasing their positions) made purchases, briefly raising prices. But the gains were short-lived, and the market soon weakened again, ultimately falling five yuan. Transaction volume remained lackluster, with only over five hundred taels traded throughout the day. Silver jewelry prices decreased slightly by one yuan. Customs gold, Sino-British pure gold, etc., remained stagnant. The cash gold market fell five yuan.</p>
<p>Gold Market Falls Five Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, initial sentiment was weak, with good selling interest from small investors and brokers, causing the market to open five yuan lower. Then, a certain money changer and a cash gold firm successively placed a total of one hundred taels with a certain gold firm (increasing positions for speculators), all at a price of 2,124 yuan. After opening, the gold firm continued to absorb supply, strengthening the market. The gold firm then sold fifty taels to a securities firm at twenty-five yuan. Subsequently, money changers traded fifty taels at the same price. Later, sellers became scarce, and the price was raised by three yuan, with the gold firm absorbing fifty taels each from money changers and silver shops, rising to a peak of twenty-eight yuan for the day. Thereafter, the gold firm stopped buying and watched, and the market weakened again. A cash gold firm sold fifty taels to a money changer at twenty-six yuan for the midday price. The afternoon trend was flat and weak, opening two yuan lower. Money changers and cash gold firms successively sold a total of one hundred taels to a certain silver shop (mainly on behalf of Hong Kong interests), all at a price of twenty-four yuan. The market then turned quiet. At 3:30 PM, money changers traded fifty taels at twenty-four yuan. After this, sellers continued to ask for twenty-four yuan, but buyers only offered twenty-two yuan, making transactions difficult. The closing price remained 2,124 yuan, resulting in a five-yuan drop compared to the previous day's close. The price fluctuated only four yuan throughout the day. The cash gold firm sold its own-brand gold at 2,130 yuan and bought it back at 2,120 yuan. Spot gold was listed fifty yuan lower than quoted gold, with trading activity but no actual sales.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed One Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The per-tael price of silver jewelry remained unchanged initially. But at 10:20 AM, the weakness of the gold market caused a one-yuan reduction. Large firms then listed at 216 yuan, new firms at 214 yuan, and purchase price was 208 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Stagnates Again</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 19th reported that British pure gold remained stagnant at seven pounds, eight shillings, and six pence per ounce. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash gold also remained static at 1,212.30 yuan. The listed price for customs gold remained flat at two yuan, three jiao, nine fen, six li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Futures Bank's Supply Still Strong</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, only foreign firms were settling accounts in the spot market, and foreign banks were willing to supply funds, resulting in little change. Although the Nisshin and Tianjin banks continued to trade futures, both Chinese and foreign banks remained eager to sell, and foreign firms made few purchases for settlement, resulting in ample liquidity. Thus, the situation remained one of a flat spot market and a loose futures market. Consequently, swaps (spot versus this month) were trading at par. Trading was brisk in the morning. Although money changers and foreign firms frequently absorbed Hong Kong dollars, foreign banks' willingness to sell increased, leading to a neutral result.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London forward and backward prices were both up .0625, New York silver prices were static, and London gold prices were unchanged. Exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar, Shanghai currency, and French franc were all flat. The exchange rates between the US dollar and the British pound, Shanghai currency, and French franc also remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed rates remained as before. Banks' opening spot selling prices were eight pence two five for the British pound and sixteen yuan zero six two five for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous evening's close. After opening, foreign firms first settled with the Mercantile Bank and the Netherlands Bank for spot British pounds at eight pence two five. Then they settled with the American Bank for spot US dollars at sixteen yuan zero six two five. Because of the balance of supply and demand, there was no change. When the HSBC's listed price was announced, it remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced at two and a half percent, calculated at 5.50%. At that time, Chinese banks frequently placed orders for British and US dollar futures, and with few purchases for settlement, the market became firm. Chinese banks Dongya sold British pounds for delivery this month to Shanghai at eight pence two five. Subsequently, the German-Chinese bank also placed an order for US dollar futures for this month at sixteen yuan zero six two five. Later, the Chinese Continental Bank sold US dollars for delivery in July to the American Bank Chase at fifteen yuan nine three seven five. Soon after, it sold British pounds for delivery in August to a foreign bank at eight pence one two five. Near midday, a company acting for the Tianjin banks suddenly absorbed US dollars for delivery in August from foreign banks at fifteen yuan eight seven five. Later, the foreign bank Sino-Belgian sold spot Hong Kong dollars to money changers at fifty-five yuan three seven five. At the same time, the foreign bank Netherlands also placed an order for spot Hong Kong dollars with foreign firms at fifty-five yuan three seven five, remaining stable. At midday, banks' spot selling prices were eight pence two five for the British pound, sixteen yuan zero six two five for the US dollar, and fifty-five yuan three seven five for the Hong Kong dollar. The spot prices for British pounds, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars remained flat, while the futures prices for British pounds and US dollars continued to loosen. The legal currency was worth nine jiao three fen and some change.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British pure gold price and British/US dollar exchange rates remained unchanged. Foreign exchange transactions were brisk, foreign banks supplied funds smoothly, and market prices were stable. There was no market in the afternoon. When the gold market opened, individual investors were actively selling, causing weakness. Later, the gold firms buying interest was concentrated and the market price improved. After that, wealthy investors supplied funds and the price weakened again. Supply and demand were equal in the afternoon, and transactions were not active. The result was a slight drop compared to the previous day. Supply and demand for foreign currencies, British pounds and US dollars, were in equilibrium, with British pounds and US dollars slightly weaker. Transactions for British and US dollar drafts were brisk, and market prices were stable. Because of the tightening potential of Hong Kong dollar drafts, supply was sluggish.

The legal tender was worth nine jiao three fen and some change. The association's transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market prices were: British pounds down one jiao, Hong Kong dollar drafts up two li, French franc drafts up five hao. Other firms' supply did not change.</p>

<h3>Securities Foreign Stock Market More Active, Domestic Debt Also Rises Yesterday</h3>

Confidence returned, short positions were covered, and prices continued their strong upward trend. Classes C and E both pierced the 52 yuan level, and Class D reached two yuan. Short covering from the previous day, plus retail buying, led to shifts in the trading strategy. If the environment remained free of unexpected shocks, prices would be stable, though without significant upside. Throughout the day, more of Tiansheng and Lianhe were being absorbed in the morning, and No. 41 and No. 35 were also being bought. There were few sellers, only No. 20, Dafeng and Xieda were selling, and prices rose gradually by 4-5 jiao.

<h3>Textiles Sichuan-Yunnan Wholesale Develops</h3>
<p>Cloth Market Local wholesale business remains dull and listless. After North China returned to using legal tender, the wind of stocking goods gradually subsided and the trading plate shifted downward. For this reason, the Tianjin buyers declined. But wholesale business in the southwest, Sichuan and Yunnan, developed somewhat, and 100-odd boxes of dyed fabrics, dyed twill, and bleached, prepared textiles were transacted. Fifty bales of fine cloth and fine twill were re-ordered from Wenzhou in Zhejiang, 7-80 bales of "Three Rabbit" fine twill, Fugui Dapeng fine cloth, and Ewo weight coarse cloth, Guangdong ordered about 50 pieces of dyed fabric, dyed twill, pongee, fine cloth, and other goods. Sales of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, pongee, printed satin, and printed cloth, by street wholesalers, are limited to small retail sales by stores and wholesalers in the interior. All levels of wholesale trading lack scale. Sales trend downward. White goods and patterned goods are being sold off by retailers for a small amount of money at low prices, about 1-2 jiao lower per bolt by overall market value.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth The fine cloth and twill market this morning rose, but fell in the afternoon. 12 lb. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at a high of 13.55 yuan, fell to a low of 13.35 yuan, and recovered later to 13.45 yuan. Trading among local dealers improved slightly, and confidence gradually stabilized. 7-800 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were purchased. A department of the Abu Western Trading Company offered 200 bales of this month's "Dragon Head" fine cloth, at a price of 13.4 yuan per bolt. In addition, the Dongmian Western Trading Company ordered 100 pieces of "Precious Baby" fine twill for the next month, at a price of 12 yuan per bolt. But sales in northern markets remain quiet.</p>
<p>Exports 390 pieces of textiles were shipped to Shantou today, and 56 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. Various dealers' source was that six or seven companies delivered from the lower river, Songjiang and Nangang.</p>
<h3>Food Grain and Rice Arrivals and Inventories Both Strong; Highest Price Still 17.7-8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Regarding yesterday's deliveries from various dealers, 6-7 companies arrived with cargo from the lower river, Songjiang, and Nangang. The Cheh Lun, Bao Zi, Suzhou, and Tong companies delivered 3,450 bales. Over 600 bales came from Kunshan. Though it is said that the Tangxi area is sealed off, in reality, clandestine deliveries continue. Daily arrivals total around 1,500-600 bales. As for Wuhu, as long as the tax increase is successful, there will be no obstruction to exports, so arrivals continue to flow in. Moreover, Shanghai is well supplied. Rice merchants estimate that warehouses and stores hold around one million dan, so there is no reason for rice prices to rise sharply. But because of the special circumstances in Shanghai, both concession authorities are on high alert, so anxieties grow, which impacts rice and grain. Retail customers crowd the stores to stock up, and shopkeepers, to meet the demand, buy in volume, regardless of price. Customers are profiteering. Yesterday, when the restrictions in the concessions were eased, confidence was restored. Supply was strong. Given this dual situation, the rice market is changing. Street sales have slackened, and speculators are selling, while sellers rush to unwind. In a flash, the market is oversupplied, and prices are falling. If a regular dealer opened with high japonica, and sold for 17.8 yuan, then 1 jiao less, for 17.7 yuan, then that is 2-3 jiao down from the earlier market. Other japonica and thin indica prices are similar. Du Yang, sharp head, and Pierced Sharp, are in short supply, down slightly by a jiao or so. White Yuan, though glutted and furiously dumped, is down 6-7 jiao. However, its sales are small, and its price remains flat relative to japonica. In short, this market seems to have a small correction after a big rise. Rice merchants manipulation has not stopped. Waves are unbounded.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the price of customer xian was impacted by the sharp fall in the price of japonica rice, and some customer stockpiles sought to sell. Moreover, because the stockpiles were stored in warehouses along the banks of the Huangpu River, they feared difficulty with deliveries, so they offered samples. In the morning, the price of regular Beijing and Wuhu xian rice fell by 2-3 jiao. Then sellers' thinking improved, and they intended to persist in holding the line, and a Saigon telegram quoted 19.7 yuan, a 2 jiao rise compared with the previous day's telegram. New transactions were not agreed. Customer xian prices immediately recovered by 1-2 jiao. Spot Saigon rice still holds at yesterday's opening of 19.5-6 yuan. The inventories of western round-grain rice are abundant, and prices are down by another small 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Tianjin Dealers Complete a Batch, Mills Discount Prices by One Jiao, Over 4,000 New Sacks of Wheat Arrive</h3>
<p>Flour trading improved slightly. Demand from northern and southern dealers grew gradually. Dealers from the north have not been placing orders smoothly for some time. Now, the local flour price has loosened, and the exchange rate issue is receiving a great deal of attention. They are unwilling to accept anything that is not cheap, and in order to break out of the slow market, mills discounted prices to spur sales, so the price of No. 2 flour fell from 4.55 yuan cash to 4.45 yuan, a drop of one jiao. Pao Che brand sold for 4.6 yuan. Tianjin dealers completed a batch of 30,000 sacks, and northern dealers are also testing the waters. Formal trading might be realized at the beginning of next week. In addition to the northern group's bulk transactions, sales to the southern and other interior customers were unremarkable. Retail trading on the street was also flat, and the wholesale price on the street remains at the original 4.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat supply continued to arrive, with just over 4,000 sacks transported from Changzhou, Wuxi, and other interior areas. It is said that older goods from the interior are being offered. It is also said that spot prices have fallen sharply, and suppliers are unable to hold up the price, and are willing to unload at market prices. The factory delivery price for Northern Jiangsu wheat is only 6.1 yuan, and central Jue wheat must still clear customs. The suppliers are hoping that Japanese dealers will take an interest, so transactions remain stagnant.</p>
<h3>Yarn Cotton, Sales Without Vigor, Cotton Yarn Bulls Return, "Double Horse" and "Angel" Rise 5-6 Yuan, Japanese Yarn Has Begun to Return and Ship from Outside Shanghai</h3>
<p>After several days of declines, the yarn market improved yesterday. Obstructions in the concessions have been removed, original conditions have been restored, traffic is normal, and the public is at peace. In addition, general retail customers have mostly cleared accounts, and speculation has died down. Instead, prices have become stronger. Big customers are mostly on the long side, and the reaction is dramatic. The market plate rises step by step. But sales to customers remain sluggish. Sales to Fujian and the coast are impacted by Japanese naval disturbances, and shipments have stopped. But trade with Guangdong and Yunnan continues, though purchase volumes are small. Dealers and traders absorbed shipments that arrived, and the market plate improved. Everything depends on sales to strengthen the foundations.</p>
<p>As for conditions with spot yarn, when the market opened in the morning, prices among dealers were tight. Due to the easing of the concession issues, prices rallied. Prices rose 1-2 yuan. The prices for "Double Horse" door ticket yarn was 414 yuan, and the warehouse ticket price was 409 yuan. Shortly after, sentiment suddenly heated up, buying rose sharply, and offers rose steadily, mostly the result of dealer speculation. A market was strong, all were raising prices. The highest price ever reached for "Double Horse" ex-warehouse spot was 423 yuan, and the warehouse ticket price was 417 yuan. By the closing, buying was somewhat clearer, and some profits were taken, with a slight fall of 1-2 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, actual trading remained unremarkable. However, sentiment was still up, and the "Double Horse" warehouse tickets started at 414.5 yuan, but then rose another step to 416 yuan. The closing price fell back by a little over 5 jiao. The ex-warehouse spot price remained 421.5 yuan. It is found that buyers took a total of 1,455 bales. The prices of 20-count "Double Horse" rose 5 yuan, "Angel" rose 6 yuan, "Double Globe" rose 3.5 yuan, and "Shepherd" rose 2 yuan. The prices of 10-count yarn remained flat. Today, 820 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 700 bales were shipped to Hong Kong, and 1,040 bales were shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by various dealers are listed below. Dealers 775 Hong Kong 485 Shantou 150 Interior 45 Total 1,455</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market started by rising, and then weakened, and the result was a fall compared to the previous day. And prices are very weak, because sales to customers have stopped, sentiment is low, and it is rumored that sales prices in other ports are very low, and there is no market. Shipments have begun to return and ship from outside Shanghai. 20 count "Moon Zither" yarn opened in the morning at 355 yuan, but fell to 348 yuan, a fall of 3 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>High Overseas Prices Local Cotton Mill Sales Improve North Jiangsu Source Is Open Again and Arrivals Are Gradually Brisk</h3>
<p>Cotton prices: The New York cotton market was first caused by Liverpool and Bombay reports of a sharp rise, triggering purchases from foreign merchants and the covering of most shorts. Market prices rose 1-9 points, then due to rumors from Washington that loan cotton would be released, cotton prices showed a slight return. The result was that the near term was unchanged, and the future term fell slightly by 3-5 points. Yesterday, India, along with forecasts, rose another 2 robis. However, yesterday afternoon the phone call came that the cotton market in Bombay slightly increased by a fraction of a robi. Egypt rose another 20-odd points. Converting to legal tender, American cotton was unchanged, Indian cotton was up 7 jiao, and Egyptian cotton was up over 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading, Chinese and foreign factories were quiet. Even dealers did not trade. This was really because high overseas prices were too strong. Although Brazilian cotton is cheaper than American cotton, in terms of quality, it does not match American cotton. Moreover, recently, because Brazilian cotton has been ordered too much, local prices have risen by over 1 yuan. Therefore, all foreign cotton has stopped. The cotton market selling price yesterday is listed below. Raw Materials Type Factory Delivery Price plus 60 count tax: Egyptian cotton, Premium, 109.65 Medium, 106.70 80 count Premium, 130.10 Medium, 119.65 20 count: American Middling, 93.50 Low, 80.30 32 count 102.30, low, 93.40 42 count 104.20, low 92.05 South American Brazil, premium, 92.85, medium 90.65, low 87.30 10 count Indian Fruit, 69.65, 16 count, Indian and Mullah, 76.00, 20 count, Indian White Rock, 81.60, 24 count, Indian Kampo Di 87.60 32 count American variety Sinter 91.20, 32/42 count American variety Pengjialu 95.75</p>
<p>Yesterday, another 515 pieces of Indian cotton were imported, transported from Bombay by the British ship "Boden" (transliterated), docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>Local cotton, which has been sluggish for a long time, has recently shown signs of active development, so sales prices are getting better and rising. Recently, American and Indian cotton markets are steadily climbing, hitting this year's new highs. The spot price of American cotton is approaching one jiao. The market in white corner four and five month Indian cotton has risen by 171 robis. The calculated price is growing daily, and is gradually approaching the price of local cotton. Therefore, each factory is buying. The Yong An, Zhong Xin, and Yu factories are actively taking stocks. At the same time, a source from North Jiangsu has been holding on for several days. They have now found a way to dredge the channel and deliveries are brisk. The miscellaneous expenses of the route have been heavily extorted by those in between. 1,498 sacks of Tongzhou cotton and 620 pieces of wooden frame cotton have arrived. The conditions for current cotton sales are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Crush Finished, Primary Goal Achieved, Bean Oil Hits 40 Yuan, Crude Oil Prices Sharply</h3>
<p>Since the trading funds in soybean oil have been controlled by bullish companies, it has been quite short, leading the price to rise. The price of speed oil reached the 40 yuan mark, up over 1 yuan from the previous market. At this point, the first goal of the bullish companies seems to have been achieved. Perhaps it will temporarily hover and then advance again in a roundabout way. Yesterday, the spot market opened with 350-odd drums of "Great Fortune" oil, with prices rising from 39 yuan to 40 yuan. There were also 20 drums of "Prosperity" oil at 39 yuan, 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at 28.5-29 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai oil at 29.5-30 yuan, and 500 cans of Qingdao canned oil at 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Crude oil is also selling well, with prices up 1.5-2 yuan, because the sales markets are more active than that of soybean oil and have avenues for mixing with sesame oil. And because the costs are high, the owners are unwilling to sell cheaply, so in the improved environment, the price rises more sharply than with soybean oil. Yesterday, the price of Dalian drummed crude oil rose 2 yuan to 42 yuan on 20 drum transactions. The price of Jiaozhou crude oil rose 1.5 yuan on sales of 30 pieces for spot and 500 pieces en route. Prices opened at 31.5 yuan.</p>
<p>200 cans of sesame oil and 380 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Even Straw Mats Are Unusually Expensive</h3>
<p>It's early summer, the weather is getting hotter, and it's the season for selling straw mats. The sources of straw mats are Suzhou's Hukou, Yangzhou, and Zhejiang's Wenzhou and Ningbo. However, Ningbo's straw mats are of the best quality and durable, so their sales are also very prosperous. Hukou's straw mats are made of fine hemp woven with mat grass. Villagers all take weaving mats as their profession. After they are made, they are sold in towns and then distributed to customers by various mat shops. Now in Shanghai, due to the river closure of Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang, transportation from Suzhou is inconvenient, and with the increase in donations, the cost has also increased, which is one or two times higher than in previous years. For example, a five- or six-foot-sized bed hemp-woven mat that used to sell for two or three yuan and forty cents each now sells for five or six yuan and some odd cents. Mats made of coarse grass also sell for two or three yuan. The most common coarse mats that used to sell for four or five cents to one or two yuan now sell for seventy or eighty cents to one or two yuan. In addition, the price of pillows made from straw mats has also increased. Now a two-foot-long Dragon Beard mat sells for thirty cents, and a white hemp-woven mat sells for about twenty-five cents.</p>
<h3>Medicine: Star Anise Recovers and Revitalizes</h3>
<p>A batch of star anise arrived in the market some time ago and the selling price fell to twenty yuan. However, the owners did not make a profit and will not continue to do so. It is found that some merchants here still have high-priced goods. Yesterday, more than twenty packages were sold, with a total value of one hundred yuan in cash. The market is recovering.</p>

<h3>Foreigners at the Manufacturing Bureau Burned</h3>
<p>An Englishman named Keleshi, who drew boat designs at the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau, and an Englishman named Mianlun, a shipwright, lived in the building in front of the bureau. On the 21st of this month, another Englishman named Wei Yilinsi, who lived in Longhua and made Remington bullets, came to visit and stayed in the building that night. Suddenly, at one o'clock that night, a fire blazed, starting from Keleshi's room, probably due to the cold weather and the stove being too hot, which spread to the floorboards. At that time, hundreds of officials, staff, and workers in the bureau rushed to put out the fire, but the fire was too fierce, the building was all made of wood, and there were wooden materials stacked downstairs. The doors and windows of the rooms where the foreigners Keleshi and others lived were all red, and it was difficult for the people inside to come out, and it was impossible for the people outside to go in to rescue them. All the rooms where the foreigners Keleshi and others lived, and the wooden model building, a total of twelve rooms, were burned down. The fire was extinguished by dawn. Three piles of bones were barely found in the ashes, meaning Keleshi and the other two could not escape the fire and were burned to death. That day, the officials in the bureau immediately informed the Shanghai County and the British Consul to inspect the scene, which was very tragic!</p>
<h3>Profits Earned by Qi Chang</h3>
<p>The Qi Chang Shanghai Steamship Company has finalized a list of business profits for last year for shareholders to review. According to last year, after deducting ship repair and other expenses, the net profit was a total of 524,665 taels of silver. From this 524,665 taels, 270,000 taels must be paid for the principal and interest of each share at twelve percent. Another 82,000 taels must be paid as commissions to those who patronize the business. After deducting these two expenses, only 172,665 taels of silver remain, which has been allocated for public use next year.</p>

<h3>Meat and Rice</h3>
<p>— Cai Qing</p>
<p>The slaughterhouse company and fresh meat industry in this city have uniformly suspended slaughter and sales since the 13th to express their consistent attitude because the "livestock market" monopolizes pigs. Now, accepting the persuasion of the authorities of the two concessions, they have temporarily resumed business. Under the efforts of the two concessions to maintain the people's food supply, this resolution to suspend the market by the fresh meat industry can be said to have achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Pork is a daily necessity for us. During this week of suspension, ordinary households felt a kind of habitual inconvenience. However, Muslims do not eat pork, and there are countless people in Shanghai who do not know the taste of meat all year round. Moreover, with the imminent arrival of summer, even if there is no meat to eat, it is very beneficial in terms of hygiene and thrift.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most noteworthy thing now is the issue of rice. Because of the speculative manipulation of hoarders, first-class rice has exceeded seventeen yuan, and medium and inferior rice have also risen above the price limit. According to yesterday's report, Fu Qiangeng, chairman of the Market Management Committee, received threatening letters due to the strict enforcement of price limits and the crackdown on black market transactions. At the same time, rice merchants also issued a public letter "clarifying the truth." Outsiders like us naturally have no way to judge the truth, but the high price of rice is something everyone suffers. We can do without meat, but how can we do without rice? We, as citizens, appeal to immediately eliminate the "inside story of price increases" and not add to our burden any further.</p>
<p>Furthermore, comparing the high price of rice with the suspension of fresh meat sales, this situation is exactly the opposite. The so-called "examine one's conscience" is the best time for testing now.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the "Family Service Department"</h3>
<p>— Jing Jiu</p>
<p>The war has created unprecedented "prosperity" in this isolated island, but this "prosperity" is deformed, consumptive, and unhealthy. Among the five million people, how many are actually engaged in production? Aren't most of them people who have fled from the mainland and the occupied areas? In the difficult life of "living in Chang'an is not easy," "increasing income and reducing expenditure" is indeed a major issue at present. How to "increase income"? There is no second way other than engaging in production and increasing production. As for "reducing expenditure," one must start by reducing consumption.</p>
<p>Recently, a bank has taken on this task, which has to be said to be a noteworthy event.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw an advertisement in several newspapers in this port. It was an advertisement for the Cheng Ye Bank's addition of a "Family Service Department." The content was very simple, only sixteen large characters were printed: "Reduce troubles, activate the economy, promote thrift, and resolve difficulties." Driven by curiosity and also because I didn't understand the situation, I went there for a visit the next morning. Their address was in the Continental Building on Jiujiang Road. I went to the third floor and saw the words "Cheng Ye Bank Affiliated Family Service Department." I immediately pushed the door open, stated my intention to the waiter, and waited in the reception room for about three or four minutes. A person of short stature came out to meet me. We exchanged business cards and learned that he was Mr. Chen, the manager of the bank. After I stated my intention, I began to ask him about the purpose of establishing the Family Service Department and the general situation inside. He told me the following: The scope of services provided by the department is temporarily divided into four groups: (1) Entrusted agency collection and payment group: such as entrusted collection and payment of accounts, with full responsibility. (2) Mortgage overdraft group: to seek economic activities for all walks of life. (3) Consumer cooperative group: All daily necessities for households, such as rice, coal, firewood, charcoal, etc., can be entrusted to handle. (4) Personnel consulting group: to cope with personnel changes. The joining procedure is also very simple. You only need to pay the lowest handling fee on a monthly basis and receive the department's certificate to enjoy the above four group rights. At this point, I said goodbye to the manager. I think this is indeed a beneficial thing for households on this isolated island, so I am very happy to introduce it to people living on the isolated island. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>
<h3>Beware of Traps</h3>
<p>— (Qian)</p>
<p>My hometown was destroyed by artillery fire, and I fled to this isolated island. Dance halls are open all night, and movie theaters are always full. Our refugee-style life in the pigeon loft is also difficult to maintain, so I am eager to find some work to avoid the danger of starvation. My relative Zhao met an old classmate, Han, who said that he was working for the ×× Soda Company on ×× Road, Hongkou, and wanted to add a telephone operator. He introduced me to the company and quickly obtained a "pass" for me. I was secretly happy to find a job, but I was uneasy because I was not sure if I could handle the service.</p>
<p>The first day I went to work, it was a Western-style house with very simple equipment. Upstairs, in a room called the writing room, there were two desks, and two well-dressed young men and a Russian who spoke fluent Chinese were sitting there. They asked me to sit at a desk with a telephone and said that if someone called to order soda, I should record it, and that would be my job.</p>
<p>Office hours were from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. There were very few calls, so they often talked to me, saying that I shouldn't be so reserved and let people see me as outdated. They said that European and American women were so good at socializing, and they were willing to buy me new clothes and take me to the movies, etc., to seduce me. They also said that the company would have a transaction of 50,000 boxes of soda next week, with a commission of one yuan per box, and the people in the company would share 50,000 yuan. On the fifth day, they suddenly took a stack of banknotes and gave them to me, insisting that I not go home. Fortunately, my relative came to visit and I was able to escape from the cage.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a dark world, full of thorns. I think this is not just a simple trick to play with women, there must be a bigger inside story behind it. I respectfully write this article, hoping that female comrades who are seeking employment will pay attention.</p>

<h3>Words and Deeds</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>"Disregarding deeds, and deeds disregarding words," such people are naturally not to be agreed with, because their actions either do not match their words, or are absolutely opposite. Then it is better to have no words than to have words.</p>
<p>But if there are only words and no actions, then the words are equal to no words, and it is better not to say them, because if there are no words, others do not expect actions. If there are words, others will deeply hope that the words will be put into practice, and that the actions will be exactly as the words. Therefore, empty words that offer benefits but do not deliver are the most disappointing.</p>
<p>I deeply hope that those who speak will be able to practice what they say. I have deep hopes for the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: A Virtuous Mother with a Chignon and Blue Skirt; A Vigorous Old Man with Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves</p>
<p>The two Miss He were very moved after listening and asked, "Is this Mr. Xu still strong now? He has no children, is he all alone now?" Village Chief Zhu said, "Things in the world are quite unpredictable. When Old Man Chang Xu donated all his assets to the country, it was indeed out of his loyalty and patriotism. But it was also because he had no descendants, so he had no use for so much property, and he was somewhat resentful. Besides, he thought he was old, and by the time this war was over, he would have long been buried. Who knew that he is still alive and well today, which is truly beyond his own expectations. Just now, Miss He asked him: Is he all alone now? Alas! It is especially strange to hear. He married a wife in his seventies, and now he even has a son." The two Misses He, Shuangyu and Liyu, were surprised and said, "Really? That's really a strange story!" Village Chief Zhu sighed and said, "That's why I said that things in the world are hard to predict. Old Man Xu ruined his family to relieve the country's difficulties and provided a lot of assistance to the guerrillas in various places. At that time, there was a captain in the guerrillas who was also from their Shuizhu Village. His name was Xie, and he was very brave. He went in and out of the guerrilla area, and the enemy was very troubled by him. Later, he was promoted from captain to battalion commander, and he had many subordinates. However, when it came to a sum of military pay, the government sometimes couldn't provide it in time, and Old Man Xu made the advances. The Xie family consisted of a brother and sister. His sister's name was A'yu, and she was a widow. At that time, she was also fifteen or sixteen years old. Don't look down on her as a woman, she could shoot with both hands and hit the target every time. Initially, the people of Shuizhu Village called her a female soldier. In fact, she could lead a small team and go in and out of the guerrilla area. Because the Xie siblings and Old Man Xu were from the same village, they were all supported by him financially. Later, Xie A'yu's brother died in battle, and Old Man Xu took care of all his funeral arrangements, and the orphans and widows were also properly taken care of. The guerrillas were led by someone else sent by the higher authorities, and A'yu was no longer in the army. However, she often went to Old Man Xu's house, or when the old man had any illnesses or worries, she would visit him and comfort him. Because he was truly all alone at that time. At that time, someone made a joke and advised A'yu to marry this old man. A'yu was somewhat moved. She didn't want to marry in the first place, but her unwillingness to marry wasn't to uphold the old etiquette and prepare to show off her chastity to others. But sometimes she felt lonely and felt that she had a good relationship with this old man. Everyone was all alone, so why not combine forces?" (115)</p>
<h3>Impressions of "The Mad Miss Manton"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>The Mad Miss Manton</p>
<p>Produced by RKO Pictures, Showing at the Great Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>"The Mad Miss Manton" is a detective film. Yes, it is a detective film. At the same time, it can be handled in a farce-like manner, just like Myrna Loy's "The Thin Man." Even in the style of the leading actress, Barbara Stanwyck (note to readers: she recently married Robert Taylor) is similar to Myrna Loy.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, this kind of farcical detective film has become a trend. Why is this so? This is something we can discuss.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason for the farcicalization of detective films is nothing more than the following: (1) The "Blue Eagle Movement" has passed. The "kill without question" detective film has become the end of the crossbow. In order to change things up, the screen is no longer full of stray bullets but full of laughter; (2) In general detective films, it is indeed not easy to create suspicion and tension from beginning to end; Moreover, in order to make it easier and more interesting for the gentry and ladies to watch, the farcicalization of detective films appeared in the form of a combination of romantic comedy and detective film. In other words, it is also what movie merchants call "liveliness."</p>
<p>However, is this kind of combined film the solution to the problem? I would like to ask you: When this kind of "combined" "detective comedy" (please forgive me for inventing a name) becomes "mediocre" again and is tired of by the audience, what will its future be?</p>
<p>Of course, this is a later story, but now, the "detective comedy" is precisely the "seasonal dish." Let's take a look at "The Mad Miss Manton," one of these "seasonal dishes."</p>
<p>Miss Manton is a willful and curious lady. She met the reporter Peter (you know, they inevitably ended up getting married) because Peter ridiculed her false report of a tragedy. So Manton rushed to the newspaper office and slapped him in the face as soon as they met. Peter immediately returned the slap, and then, they often met because of this case. Then, they "gradually developed love," then "dear," and then "hit it off and got married." As for the course of the tragedy, it is not necessary to repeat it here. Anyway, it is this set. As for the social basis, since the goal is to make the detective film a farce, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to kill some time, then this movie is barely worth watching; if you want to get some education, then there is none. Unless you are a film worker (especially a director), then you can learn from his clear editing and characterization here.</p>
<p>Barbara Stanwyck's Miss Manton is not bad. She makes me think of Irene Dunne's appearance in "The Awful Truth," but not as bold as Irene Dunne in "The Awful Truth." As for Henry Fonda, I think he is better off not playing a romantic young man. Roles like the young fisherman (the "The Moon and Sixpence" which he co-starred with Dorothy Lamour and George Raft is this kind of role) are more suitable. There is plenty of simple honesty, but not enough dashing romance.</p>
<p>The rest of the supporting roles are also mediocre. The overall atmosphere is due to the director.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Revival of Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>Qiuping</p>
<p>Kunqu Opera is gentle and refined. For two hundred years, the world has been at peace. Virtuous scholars and officials, after managing affairs, would play the music of flowing water and high mountains with golden zun and jade flute. Fame was not sought, and profit was not the goal. In the late Guangxu period, Qin Opera flourished and this tune declined. To this day, only Xianni remains in the south, and Han Bai is left in the north. The passing of Guangling tunes evokes many emotions. However, in the past ten years, Xianni Society has made painstaking efforts, and its artistic skills have improved day by day. Its newly arranged plays include "The Sky Cannot Be Supplemented," "The Legend of the Southern Tower," "Zhaojun's Journey to the Xiongnu," and "Three Smiles." The examination of each word and tune is studied all day long, with the diligence of Bodhidharma facing the wall. However, the audience still cannot be popularized and trended towards. This is due to the trend of the times, and the clanging of earthen pots has led to this.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of drama is closely related to amateur performers. Recently, some amateur performers have also practiced Kunqu Opera, and the interest in opera societies has gradually increased. Gengchun in Ping has to be held every month, and the Play Research Association founded by Layman Letian invites Master Hongdou to take the lead. Zhu Chuanming, Zhang Chuanfang, Zheng Chuanjian, and others frequently play the flute and sing tunes. I also heard that some universities have a course in lyrics and music. Students use music as a sideline in their spare time. The themes of loyalty, filial piety, friendship, and love, and the feelings of generosity and tragedy are mostly seen in legends such as "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Iron Crown Picture," "The Lute," and "The Moon Pavilion." Not only is it important for literature and art, but it is also beneficial to the world and people's hearts. From this point of view, Kunqu Opera is about to be revived!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Xianni Society today, although there are only a dozen people, they are very impressive. Wang Chuanpu and Fang Chuanyun are very energetic in martial arts performances. Chuan Song wins with stillness, and Zhou Chuanying wins with romance and elegance, all of which are extremely good. It is hoped that the society will work together to maintain the remaining situation. It is expected that after the world becomes clear, literature and art will flourish, and music will surely rise again. Xing Shu-jun stated that scenery, costumes, and publicity are the keys to the revival of Kunqu Opera. His words are good. I heard that Kunqu actors do not display signs, the order of plays is not fixed, and there is no hierarchy for extras. These are all characteristics of Kunqu. A few years ago, Kunqu actors went abroad and performed "The West Chamber" to a full house, without using scenery. This is because the sounds and images are all revealed in the lyrics. Only publicity is indispensable. I hope that Kunqu artists will verify the facts, promote loyalty and integrity, explain the lyrics and music, praise good and criticize evil, and cultivate flute masters, commend and encourage them, and assist each other. If powerful people can help with the economy, then the revival of Kunqu Opera will be just around the corner. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching the Charity Sale in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Luo Ding</p>
<p>The term "charity sale" has not been brought to Shanghai from Hong Kong for long, and the art world in Shanghai may be the first to hold a charity sale in a public place. A few days ago, a friend who returned from Hong Kong told me that the total income from charity sales in Hong Kong reached more than one million national currency. Therefore, this charity sale movement in Shanghai seems to be worth seeing.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the venue, I met several people in charge. With their guidance, I quickly saw all the works in the venue. Of course, these works are not something that ordinary self-proclaimed artists are willing to see. This is because there are no mysterious works of any sect or faction inside. Most of them are commercial art and arts and crafts products. In order to achieve the purpose of easy sales, these works are especially suitable. The most eye-catching should be the Betty Carr batik products produced by the Emerging Arts and Crafts Society. This is the crystallization of the hard work of several art experts who personally created a dyeing method that has not been introduced to China for long. Therefore, it is superior in both appearance and practicality. Therefore, these products are also sold in particularly large numbers. Other items such as Du Jinsheng's silk weaving and umbrellas, Chinese paintings, and antiques are all worth buying.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the exhibition also explained to me the dual significance of this exhibition. First, he said that the reason why the exhibits in this exhibition particularly focus on arts and crafts and commercial art products. He said it is very obvious that this is the task that our art world should undertake in this great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation. It is undeniable that Chinese industry and commerce are not as good as others. We must promote the production industry. Of course, the art world is not a business, but it has great effectiveness in improving national products and developing sales. Using art to assist the improvement and development of the production industry is the same in China and foreign countries; this is even more urgently needed now in the construction of a new China. Therefore, this exhibition does not ignore other types of artistic works. The original intention was to display more commercial and industrial art. Second, he talked about the difficult situation of artists trapped on this isolated island, but in order to save their conscience, they had to do something meaningful. Rescuing refugees is also an urgent matter. Every refugee is a force of the country. In order to preserve the existence of this force, relief is needed at all times. Moreover, the season is approaching summer, and the need for medicine is even more urgent. He said that all the income from this sale, after deducting the costs of several writers and merchants and the expenses of the venue, is prepared to purchase some medical supplies to donate to the refugees.</p>
<p>It is said that the sales results of this sale are certainly not as good as those in Hong Kong, but there are many worthwhile items to buy. For the sake of conscience, it is worth taking a trip, and there are many things there that cannot be seen elsewhere. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>
<h3>Dumei Grand Theater Scheduled to Open This Weekend</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>Since the population of Shanghai has increased sharply and crowding has occurred, entertainment venues are packed, and the business of movie theaters has created an unprecedented record. Therefore, in addition to the existing movie theaters, several new movie theaters have appeared in the concession in the past year. It is now said that the Dumei Grand Theater has also been completed, the layout is in place, and it will open soon.</p>
<p>The Dumei Grand Theater is located at 9 Dumei Road in the French Concession. The architectural style is very novel. It is scheduled to officially open this weekend, and the first film to be shown on the opening day is MGM's "San Francisco."</p>
<p>This movie theater is not only well-built, but the indoor air is also very well regulated. The sound equipment and the latest styles, and the seats are very comfortable and spacious. In short, the entire theater building is very solid, all the equipment is very gorgeous and beautiful, and the decorations are simple, but the configuration is very appropriate.</p>
<p>A particularly noteworthy point is that behind the theater, there is a large garden for the audience to stroll around, which is not available in ordinary Shanghai theaters. The Dumei Grand Theater is also invested and operated by foreigners, and it specializes in showing second-run foreign films. The ticket prices are roughly the same as those of other theaters that specialize in showing second-run foreign films.</p>
<p>Movie stars Li Hong (right) and Wang Yang (left) have lost a lot of weight recently, which is said to be a common problem for Chinese female stars. Is there any way to improve health? This is an issue that cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>Outside the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Notable Incidents from the Life of Righteous Actor Luo Kuifang</p>
<p>The second incident occurred when he was performing in Shanghai for several years and was extremely unsuccessful. Because he was naturally taciturn and not good at socializing with his colleagues, many backstage staff thought he was arrogant. Later, when Wang Xiaonong performed on the main stage, he simply treated him as an unimportant supporting actor. For example, when Wang performed the play "Zhang Song Offers a Map," he assigned a minor role to play Liu Bei, making him stand blankly on the side, which was truly too humiliating for him. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, when Gengxin and Gongwu Stage were renovated, he finally began to feel a sense of vindication. I, Fushi, was writing theater reviews for the Shangbao at the time, and I often wrote articles to praise him. Therefore, the people in the newspaper and opera ticket circles all expressed goodwill towards him. Many famous amateur opera enthusiasts invited him to talk about opera. Although he was usually not very talkative, if he met a kindred spirit, he would not tire of talking for three days and three nights. Often, insiders have a habit of hiding their skills, but Xiao Bao never had this bad trait. He answered every question from those who asked for advice with ten answers. At that time, when Tan School's "Zhumi Village" was only seen when Shu Yan performed on the main stage, it was performed only once or twice. Although the general amateur opera enthusiasts wanted to learn this play, they had nowhere to find the lyrics. Who knew that when someone asked him for advice, he would give you a long and detailed explanation, and also tell you what he had learned that was the same as Shu Yan's, and what was different, explaining everything in detail without keeping anything secret. At that time, his performance fee was said to be a thousand yuan, but in reality, it was only six or seven hundred yuan. Both he and his wife had heavy smoking habits, and their monthly income was certainly not enough to cover their expenses. Fortunately, he had a generous and righteous friend who subsidized him two hundred yuan a month, so he was able to get by. Xiao Bao had to go to a certain gentleman's residence every day to teach opera, and this had become a habit for several years. One day, the gentleman was away for a long time and had not returned, and it was already late at night. Xiao Bao was lying alone on the bed, smoking, just as he was dozing off, he suddenly saw a maid standing in front of him, holding a roll of banknotes, handing them to him, urging him to quickly put them in his pocket. He was extremely surprised, and quickly got up to thank her, saying: "The two hundred yuan allowance that a certain gentleman gives me every month is always given on the first of the month. I just received this month's allowance the day before yesterday. Why are you sending money to me again?" The maid whispered: "This money was sent by the madam. Please accept it, Mr. Luo."
