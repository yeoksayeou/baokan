<p>日軍如犯桂省　必遭慘敗無疑</p>

<p>重慶　據華方消息、自北海西北之防城及欽縣、被日軍佔據後、粵桂邊境之局勢、已漸趨緊張、目下日軍似正以南寗為目的、向內地推進、南寗為桂南事鎮、位於通越南公路之上、聞日軍現時並不在北海前進、而係沿北海西北之公路、經防城。欽縣·向南寗推進、日軍於十一月十六日午後、佔據防城、同晚又在欽縣之南、實行登陸、日騎兵及步隊、旋卽在猛烈砲火掩護之下、進攻欽縣、激戰刻仍在進行中、據今日此間所接華方電訊、防城及欽縣區城之日軍、現正沿通至南寗之公路、向北移動、此間華方人士、咸信日軍侵入桂省、將極威困難、因粵桂邊界一帶、高山起伏、南寗以南之邊境處有鳳凰山、粵桂越南之邊界、則有十萬大山也、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>歐洲交戰國的作戰目標</h3>
<p>歐戰發生到現在快要三個月了。以現代的軍事技術交通能力而論，這三個月的時間應該早已過了準備佈置，調兵遣將的階段，而進入於酣戰的狀態中。但是事實上西戰塲上根本沒有一天緊張過。最近更連砲聲都冷落了。如果說是戰爭在天空或海上吧：但是雙方空軍的出動。又多半從事於偵察窺探，沒有發生過什麼激烈的戰鬥：至於軍艦或潛艇活動的消息雖是報道不息，但以英國海軍力的龐大，以及德國關於潛艇的自負而論，雙方所加於對方的威脅曾有幾何？總之，戰事並不緊張，那是事實。不但戰事不緊張，最近雙方忽又提起了作戰的目標問題。德國方面由國社黨機關報發表了六條作戰目標，大多是空洞無邊際的，而且在已滅波蘭之後，忽又說要恢復一個傀儡的波蘭。英國方面，國會定於本月廿二日休會，二十八日續開，屆時擬費三天的時間，從容討論此次的作戰目標。這樣的問題，照理應在開戰的當初就檢討妥貼的，何以到此刻討論起來，那麼難道過去的一切，都是沒有目標的舉動嗎？</p>
<p>問題當然不會這樣簡單的。德國發動戰事本來是有目標的，那目標就是攫取波蘭；波蘭旣已到手，而且連帶可能發生的德蘇衝突問題也已消弭於無形，那麼除希望休戰以外，他就沒有目標了。德國願意休戰，英法義務所在，豈肯罷休，德國就不得不硬着頭皮繼續打下去。可是這樣打法，德國已處於被動的地位，被動的戰爭，對外旣無方向可言，對內也不足以資號召，於是他就不得不在舊目標之外，再找一個新目標，以便化消極爲積極，轉被動爲主動。一星期前荷比邊境已到了劍拔弩張的時候，但是最近忽然又鬆弛了下來，這或許正因爲德國在目標未定以前，還不能貿然發動第二期的大戰。</p>
<p>英法方面，在開戰的當初，不是就舉起了堂堂的反侵略大旗嗎？這就是一個極正大的目標，目前何庸再有討論？何須再勞國會議員要求政府當局解釋？所以顯然的，這不是一個有沒有作戰目標的問題，而是必須把那作戰目標重新估量的問題。英法反侵略的目標誠然是正大的，可是還不夠鮮明，而且這兩個多月來的態度也不夠積極，或許就因爲這樣。所以現在就到了重新估量的時期。原來英國當初不趁民主陣綫佔絕對優勢的時候，領導全世界的和平力量，打擊法西斯陣綫，那已經不能卸却因循坐誤的責任；等到這回加入戰局之後又不能迅赴事功，解救波蘭的危機，這更不能不四人懷疑到他反侵略的態度不夠堅決。再如最近英國撤退了華北駐軍，雖有他所說的理由由，可是終不能逃避妥協的嫌疑。所以英國當局的態度，目前已很使人感到迷惘；不但別國的人迷惘，就是他本國的民衆也不免迷惘。議員們要求政府解釋作戰目標，或許就由於這樣的動機</p>
<p>迷惘的心理對於戰爭必然會發生重大影響的，所以對於交戰國實在是一個嚴重的問題。中國的抗戰已經給予全世界一個正確的指示。抵抗侵略的目標，配合着政府堅毅不變的行動，使全國民衆都抱着最後必勝的信念，這才是克敵致果的要訣。歐戰第二期大戰目前雖沒有發作，但是總有發作的一天，等到旣經發作，交戰國就必須追求勝利，不容徘徊却顧了。第一期算是誰的勝利，目前固然還沒有到判別的時期，但是第二期却一定是一番極重要的戰鬥，可以奠定全局的成敗基礎的。制勝的條件，固然軍事經濟都關重要，可是尤其重要的就是精神，而精神的健强與否，所繫乎作戰目標又極爲重大，所以作戰目標的重行檢討，在未來的戰局上是一個重要的關鍵。</p>
<p>目前德國要找到一個足資號召的作戰目標，固然是很難的；但是英法方面的目標如果不夠鮮明，不夠號召，也就同樣的不能有制勝的把握。英法方面以前不是沒有目標，目標也未嘗不正大，可是態度不夠積極，所以使人迷惘；目前的問題就在矯正過去首鼠兩端的態度，進一步結合全世界一切反侵略的力量，把握着原定的目標邁進。這樣歐戰轉變爲眞正的反侵略戰爭，得道多助，再配合着英法方面物質力量的優勢，就不難覓取眞正的世界和平。</p>

<h3>外國軍事顧問建議　有限度破壞公路　華軍總反攻須用重兵器　將利用公路作必要運輪</h3>
<p>香港　重慶方面之外國軍事顧問、業已建議重慶軍事當局、謂中國在要消極防務、例如完全破壞各戰區各項交通、以阻止日軍之再進、他日將爲中國籌備已久之大反攻中之障礙、此項舉動、目前因事關華軍之戰略方法、可使日軍目前之優勢坦克車、及重輕砲隊、失其效用、且爲最近中國得在湘北擊退日軍進犯之要素、本年四月間、當日軍進犯鄂北時之慘敗、由於華軍</p>
<p>破壞交通亦爲主因之一、此外、晋南及晋中華軍、亦曾以同一方法、將日軍之九次「掃蕩」戰爭、準備强渡黃河、侵犯陜西之企圖、挫折無餘、當日軍在華東及華中平原戰爭時、日方之坦克車、裝甲車、騎兵及砲隊、在優良公路上橫衝直撞、隨意前進、當日軍進攻徐州時、日軍之「快速部隊」、經平原而切斷華軍各師聯絡、截斷後路、並包抄華軍堅强陣地、又當日軍因黄河決堤、無法前進時、日軍則利用揚子江爲進攻漢口之坦途、今日</p>
<p>情形已非、漢口陷落後、迄今一年、華軍實施有系統破壞公路計劃、着重山嶺區城之防務方法、結果、日軍因不能運用重兵器、以致與華軍處於同等作戰地位、而形成今日之相持局面、記者最近往長沙前綫視察時、見中國歷代所作之大道、完全破壞、先前行駛運貨汽車之大道、現已種稻、在無法毀壞公路之處、華軍掘有大穴、深三四十尺、數處且貯水二三尺、旁則爲高山或稻田、大可阻止車輛在公路雨側前進、諸如此類、皆在</p>
<p>山嶺區內實施、此等地區、目前之唯一交通綫爲闊僅二尺之小路、即在長沙以甫直至衡陽等處、華軍亦進行同樣防禦計劃、據中國軍事家斷言、日軍進攻長沙時、日軍因無法將過山砲坦克車或重砲、運過新牆河、砲車及坦克車不能在小路上行駛、除小路外、日軍亦不克利用他路前進、結果擁有機關槍來復槍、及一部過山砲之華軍、與武裝相同之日軍作戰、曾受有流動戰爭之華軍各師、雖有日機在</p>
<p>空中偵察仍能依照戰略而在有關陣地集中、有時華軍雖爲避免日機偵察、但仍能在一晚間移動五十哩之遙、此輩輕裝之華軍、除食米外、能不賴他物而作戰數日、且均穿着草鞋、登山如履平地、較之着皮靴之日軍、行動大爲迅速、是以當時能迅速執行華軍指揮部之作戰命令、而將日軍一舉擊潰、反之、日軍在山嶺區作戰、人地生疏、迷失道途、復受華軍各方攻擊、不得不作「戰略上之撤退」華方軍事當局曾稱、華軍能賴</p>
<p>偉大人力運輸軍火及糧食至前綫、以應華軍之需、同時外國顧問向記者聲稱、湘北前錢華軍、從未感覺缺乏彈藥之虞、勞工數千人、肩挑背負、或以古舊手推車、將軍火及糧食運至前綫、此種情形、除非國外接濟斷絕、或國內儲藏軍火用罄、則前綫斷不致缺乏軍火、但當華軍他日實施反攻時、若欲克復漢口、在戰術上必須施用重砲、坦克車、輕砲及數千噸軍火、故目前爲防禦而破壞之交通雖合理想、但在華軍</p>
<p>大舉反攻時、適足减低反攻力量、華人方面曾言、華方偉大之人力可將華軍所需之一切軍火、運至前綫、以爲他日大舉反攻之用、華方且可重造主要公路、以便利行駛載重車及運輸重砲、但由外國顧問視之、該項工程、須費時數年之久、始克如願、法籍某顧問謂、倘破壞公路之舉、不超過限度、對於防禦，亦能頗合時宜、渠稱、「華軍目前尙無大規模反攻之確期、華軍目前仍將賡續作防禦戰爭、但希望國際情勢改變、而後決定其大反攻之確實時期云、」（十八日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>新華日報　警吿美國</h3>
<p>重慶　中國共產黨機關報新華日報、今日請美國對日採取强硬措置、略謂、美國今次對於歐戰採取中立、則在大西洋方面已無集中艦隊之必要、因而其在太平洋之地位、已大見强固、該報請美國政府與資本家母忘美國在遠東方面地位之重要、勿使日本在遠東方面樹立覇權、又謂、美國目前以軍火供給歐洲國家、雖可大獲其利、但美國對於上次大戰之後果、亦不應忘却、故爲美國計、實應完全側重於太平洋方面、蓋惟於此一區域中、美國始有無限之貿易機會與投資機會也、該報繼謂美國對於日本，儘可强硬、不必有所顧忌、蓋日本報紙對於美國之行動、如海軍之活動與膨脹、畢德曼對日制裁之建議、莫不認爲美國對日之攻擊態度、紛紛加以抨擊、但日本之政客、則對於美國又不絕獻媚、以期獲取其友誼、可知美國在遠東方面、實處於舉足輕重之地位、最後該報對於英法撤退華北駐軍之行動、認爲英法對日之讓步、（十六日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>外商在長江貿易　遭受排斥</h3>
<p>昔日商埠今成廢墟</p>
<p>英文大美晚報訪員長江流域某地通信云、此間外僑人數約與中日戰爭前相等、昔爲外國商業區者、今大半成一片瓦礫、就現象察之、日人刻正排斥外國商業、外商非因此間狀况關係、而不能營業、實因日人不欲此間有外商故也、本城若干部份已復常態、但其他部份、仍屬</p>
<p>斷垣殘壁</p>
<p>、許多店鋪稍加修葺、重新營業、貯貨雖足、但價格甚昂、致多數人欲購而力不逮、今蘋菓每磅售六角、火油一元不足兩斤、營業不佳、乃勢所必然、大街兩旁、已舖邊道、工作竄劣、但面臨大街之屋主、均被勒令繳鋪街費、所素至昂、雖屋主能費低廉之資、鋪造更佳之道路、但均不准自行敷設、日人壟斷進出口、爲商業復興之一大障礙、例如商店欲謀獲得上海之貨物、須向其領取許可證、未領此證而運貨來此者、均遭沒收、此舉使商品來往、大受阻滯、據某商言、該機關對外國貨物所徵之稅、較向相同的日貨所徵者高數倍、華人經商、難獲薄利、故此間情况</p>
<p>仍頗蕭條</p>
<p>、米麥五穀、亦受壟斷、以極小代價向農民收買、而以絕大價格售予城中消耗者、麵粉每袋售七元以上、即其一例、燃料售價甚昂、煤塊幾已無從獲得、電費每度自二角至三角半、街頭燈光暗澹、刦案迭起、遇鳴警時、警察與他人恒不往援、日人暗中控制一切、而畢校甚至敎會均遭日僞監視、敎會講道、亦須先向憲兵部報告時間地點與人數、美英僑民對此種干涉宗敎與言論自由、</p>
<p>頗為憤懣</p>
<p>、便衣或半軍裝日人、恒偕戎裝日兵赴各店舖、强迫店主購買麻醉物與他種物品、態度猙獰、店主不敢不從、且常有另一批日人接踵到來强賣奢、或則「商借款項」、遇者未敢拒絕、自前狀况若是、則熱心於「東亞新秩序」者寥若晨星、固不足奇也、</p>

<p>客秈昨市更見飛黃騰達、緣產地存米傳有日商直接出口、故到頭日減、華商仍被限制、江北秈運輸不便、半月前裝出者尚未到埠、因此市上存米隨被投機者壟斷操縱、謠言四起、人心蒙惑、新囤戶不問高低、一味搶辦、故晨市立漲元外、中市後續加二元、比之前日較大三元許、而實際交易則不逾四千包、</p>
<p>洋米前定二千九百噸外、昨日續由米糧行號添訂一千噸即裝貨、故可於下月初到申、仍由達孚洋行售出、價則為三十三元半、尚有二三批則正在接洽中、能否成交尚難預期云、</p>
<h3>麺粉亦步亦趨</h3>
<p>粉市廠盤、仍守原價、惟因連日米價步漲、人心未免帶好、兼傳各廠有減車之舉、復引起散囤之垂青、惟值週末之期、實銷仍屬有限、結果成交約四萬包左右、二號粉本盤七元二角、客盤與砲車粉則高數分至角許、回籠貨棧單亦已提升數分至一角、又聞日廠鳳凰牌粉價亦轉昂、十月份六元九角半、十一月份七元一角半云、十九日麺粉運廈門五百包、</p>
<p>小麥來源仍稀、近來銷場、久已平淡、而貨方以成本高昂、及糧價昂騰、售意又轉堅强、統市由福阜兩廠辦去常錫鎮江等麥五千包、囤戶方面做開四五車、結果市面較前略挺三五分、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油　稍事休息</h3>
<p>—但已所漲匪鮮—</p>
<p>昨日豆油及花生油行市、一致轉定、蓋七日內豆油暴漲八九元、生油劇提三四元、實銷因之却步、但一般發國難財者尚未見滿足、故其潛勢尚有迂緩前進之暗潮、昨統市做開江北生油五百聽、青島生油二十桶、價均售上日原盤、豆油除青島油稍升三角、價開七十五元三角、成交四十桶外、其他路貨仍原盤五十四元七角、成交三十桶、又烟歧油一百件、五十八元云、</p>
<p>北沙來豆子二百八二十包、七丫來五百三十包、</p>
<p>今日有豆子一千六百四十包、生仁五百四十包、運香港、又有豆子三百三十包、高梁一百十包、運廈門、</p>
<h3>金融　港幫大購黃金　本市或可稍挽頹勢</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、雖於人心怠疲中、未告跌落、結果與隔昨毫無榮辱、其中拋賣較力者乃屬證券幫、而市勢之得拉住、乃賴港幫等之一度搜進、適足相抵、初開與上日價相同、原為三千六百三十元、嗣後首來購進者、有因前日賣出之某錢兌業多頭、故遂昂達三千六百四十五元高盤、奈證券幫前來拋塞、幸銀樓幫等支持、始盤旋於三千六百三四十元之間、如是以至十一時後、突聞匯市忽報鬆硬、其時買方不繼、束手觀望、而證券幫則乘機欣開賣風、加之某銀號與金號亦頻出不絕、一度降達三千六百十五元低盤、約摸至午刻、大買戶港幫力吸、因港地金價報好、一進三百兩光景、且外匯止鬆稍穩、終告回達三千六百三十三元、不久尚為三千六百三十元收盤、但依美匯結算、竟掀低有四百二十七元之巨、午後因週六關係、場內無市、場外人少、成交不易、因某證券幫亦代港幫吸收、聞曾做高達三千六百五十元、後稍回平、最後三千六百四十五元有人賣出、上午成交暢旺、約一千兩有餘、銀樓飾金鎮日未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤未分軒輊</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開平穩、首由銀樓幫進錢兌業二十兩、仍為三千六百三十元、少頃某錢兌業買意興奮、力進三百餘兩、雖某銀號與散戶乘機塞出、但頭寸仍感狹隘、不久抬起十五元、錢兌業互做三十兩、為三千六百四十五元、時證券幫忽起賣風、且進者吃胃已足、價遂不支回挫、俄頃降落十二元、證券幫售予金號二十兩、為三千六百三十三元、後銀樓幫代客收買、重高十元、銀樓幫進證券幫四十兩、為三千六百四十三元、嗣金號與錢兌業雖來競賣、但買方吃胃尚佳、價遂一度排徊於三千六百三四十元之間、迨至十一時許、匯市突報鬆勢、進者頓形轉少、加以證券幫等賣意愈濃、跌至三千六百十五元、將近午刻、香港幫突來猛吸三百兩光景、且外匯亦止鬆轉平、趨勢頓見回平、瞬息漲起十八元、銀樓幫進錢兌業五十兩、為三千六百三十三元、後回落三元、錢兌業又吐予某銀樓三十兩、為三千六百三十元、作午收價、午後週六例假、結果較上日未分軒輊、半天祇三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進減低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未見更動、大同行仍懸三百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均減低十五元至二十元之譜、</p>
<h3>匯市岑寂　美行港電稍塞結果微見鬆動</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、因週六袛半天行市、情況始終平凡、買賣稀少、惟潛勢尚告鬆硬、而大戶經營者、於前昨數日內均未見有若何行動、故前途變化、有待下週一之開展、晨初因美對英匯兌連續再縮三分、致開盤又呈英平美緊之故態、英仍五辦士二八一二五、美為八元五六二五、入後市象岑寂、華行雖曾來買進本月期美匯、但未蒙影響、直至十一時光景、始有港幫突來吐塞、加之美行賣意忽萌、又受出口商之委託代售、情勢稍見硬化、長至五辦士三四三七五、及八元六八七五、此時匯豐見賤頗欲扒入、故稍回軟至五辦士三一二五、暨八元六二五、至迄收盤、仍達五辦士三四三七五及八元六五六二五、較上日各鬆〇六二五、期貨與現貨趨勢相似、</p>
<p>華行仍有結進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均長〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬縮〇六二五、美對英又跌三分、對滬降五分、對法小一分半、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士二八一二五、美匯八元五六二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃匯兌續小之故、開後市況沉悶、無甚交易、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大半分、此後華行興業前來扒進某行本月期美匯八元五六二五、狀態仍極平靜、價亦鮮少榮辱、如是者直至十一時光景、香港突來電塞、且其時美行大通某行等亦有吐出、故情況遂見步硬、計港電賣予匯豐等外行現貨英金五辦士三一二五及三四三七五、繼而大通某行亦售予有利等外行現貨美匯八元六二五及六五六二五、後美匯曾喊過八元六八七五、時賣者止塞、一度回軟至五辦士三一二五及八元六二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士三四三七五、美匯八元六五六二五、十二一月英金五辦士二八一二五、美匯八元五三一二五、結果比上日現期英美兩匯、各鬆〇六二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港英平美緊</p>

<p>天津匯價猛縮</p>
<p>天津十八日電、今晨匯市開盤趨軟、英匯現貨猛緊二一八七五、為四便士八七五、美匯現貨猛縮四三七五、為七元八七五、申匯升一元、為一百〇七元、『聯鈔』暗盤續昂一元二角半、為九十元〇五角、</p>
<h3>外幣隨烚赤微升</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊、供求稀少、下午烚赤微漲、跟隨稍升、英美金票變動甚微、晨間英金票降為三十九元六角、美金票降為十一元六角、開後盤旋帶堅、英金票回升至四十元、美金票回升至十一元六角五分、香港法郎荷蘭票略見需要、上升甚微、日金票供給頗暢、市況續疲、晚市為一元二角六分五厘、朝鮮票穩定、晚市仍為一元一角六分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升五角、香港票升二分、法郎票升二厘、荷蘭票升一角、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現不動</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、每千元始終呆站於三十六元左右、與前日無二、錢業公會拆息亦呆定如故、早午兩市均一角五分云、</p>
<h3>大條重見回長　印銀轉定</h3>
<p>十七日倫敦電、銀市印度買進、投機家稍有供意、市面平、收盤後極平、大條銀、近遠斯均長〇六二五、紐約銀電、美現貨仍平、又孟買銀電、印銀市況平靜、現貨微升一安那、期貨俱無榮辱、</p>
<h3>證券　外股交易熱鬧</h3>
<p>內債小有起伏</p>
<p>證券暗盤昨日市況、午前仍極平淡、升沉於五分至一角間、午後多方利用美英日上海會議之說、首先抬價、時逢週六、一般浮而不實之空頭、乃亦從而抵補、居然抬高三四角、但人氣仍疲軟無神、昨上午自開盤至收盤、依然浮沉於極小數目之間、買賣雙方毫無熱烈之情狀、午收各價高低、祇五分上落、午後多方利用時機、一方拉抬、一方出籠、散戶仍隨之抵補、居然抬高二三四角、惟脚地仍未見堅强、市價結果回好五分一角至三角半不等、成交總數共計約四十餘萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比上日</p>
<p>統甲　五七·五〇　五七·二五　五七·四五　漲〇·一〇</p>
<p>統乙　四八·八五　四八·六五　四八·八五　又〇·二五</p>
<p>統丙　四七·三五　四七·一〇　四七·三五　又〇·五〇</p>
<p>統丁　四六·〇〇　四五·九五　四五·九五　又〇·〇五</p>
<p>統戊　四七·九〇　四七·四五　四七·八五　又〇·五〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國華銀行股五十股、每股價四十三元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公司股市、開盤略靜、後漸活躍、半日交易尚稱熱鬧、升降範圍、似感狹隘、趨勢亦有難以捉摸之概、祇上海銀公司股會德豐股暨鋼業股三者開高價紀錄後甚少回顧耳、橡皮股亦堅、交易大半限於克羅華與蘭格志二股、其他無足稱道、</p>
<p>倫敦十七日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平靜、上下檔各債券、均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦十七日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、大致均告堅漲、上海自來水A股升一鎊、為十一鎊、保安保險股升十先令、為二十三鎊、麥加利銀行股回升二先令六便士、價為八鎊正、匯豐銀行英倫注冊股不動、香港注冊股升半鎊、為八十四鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股升一先令、價為二十先令、上海電車股跌一先令三便士、價為十二先令六便士、其餘平平、</p>
<h3>兩家公司發息　一家公司增資</h3>
<p>英商恒業地產有限公司昨經董事會議決、截至本年九月底一年度之股息、每股計派國幣四角、一俟常年股東大會通過後、即可定期開派云、</p>
<p>冠生國食品有限公司、二十七年度股東大會、業於日前舉行、本屆股息派給年息八厘、定於本月二十日起開始派給、</p>
<p>梅林罐頭食品股份有限公司定於本月十九日召開臨時股東大會、討論增資問題、據悉該公司原為國幣二十萬元、現擬增資二十萬元、合成四十萬元、新增之資本內除十萬元由本年度盈餘項下撥給外、其餘十萬元由各股東按股攤派云、</p>
<h3>紗花　各方運輸艱難　紗銷愈覺不振</h3>
<p>上海紗廠盈餘甚巨</p>
<p>紗市依然散漫無勁、局勢萎靡不振、此因實需荏弱、各方運輸殊感艱難、以致人心軟化、一般同業手貨、大都吃虧甚鉅、目前不願犧牲了結、於是趨勢雖欠佳、大家袖手而不動生色、因此成交愈形寥落、起伏尤為狹隘耳、就大勢測之、前途非待實銷來扶植、市況難現新恣勢也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、同業集會星散不堪、人氣撩亂、開價二十支雙馬價為六百三十二元、成交僅十包、少頃呌賣者為衆、然買者尤形缺乏、一鼓清閒之象、再跌一步、價為六百二十八元、中途絕少精彩、收盤回升二元、價為六百三十元、查半日間成交統計僅五百二十五包、上日午後成交一百六十五包、二十支雙馬跌三元半、天女跌三元、雙地球跌三元、惟十支粗紗尚平、今日出口棉紗有五十五件運暹羅、一百二十五件運香港、一百六十件運廈門、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　三二行　香港　一五五</p>
<p>內地　　二五　寗波　二〇</p>
<p>上日成交一六五</p>
<p>兩日成交統計六九〇</p>
<p>通來紗廠獲利、異常豐厚、而以日廠為尤甚、即如本埠日商上海紗廠有限公司、昨經董事會議決、截至本年十月底止、六個月之股息、每股計派國幣五元、據悉該廠本期盈餘達國幣四百六十餘萬元之餌云、</p>
<h3>華廠續購美棉</h3>
<p>本棉祇有同業胃口</p>
<p>本棉交易僅係同業有胃口、然並不暢健、略有買賣點綴而已、故市態尚屬平靜、此因紗價不起、廠商無意添補原料、暫時仍抱觀望態度、至於日商亦抱同樣步驟也、蘇北來源依然不絕於途、到四千〇九十包、常陰沙九百餘包、北沙來棉花一千八百四十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>通花　一三四·〇〇　一三六·〇〇　一三五·〇〇　一四六·二五　同業進　四九二包</p>
<p>火機　一二九·〇〇　一二九·五〇　一二八·五〇　又　三〇〇包</p>
<p>下沙花　一三六·五〇　又　一〇〇包</p>
<p>平果爾　一一八·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來殊為靜寂、廠方仍以紗價不振、故進意異常淡薄、惟各廠對於長纖維之原棉、存貨奇少、同業有鑒及此、前陸續訂購已有數千包、昨日申新亦對於長纖維之原棉、有購辦之意、故昨日訂購是項美棉一千餘件、俱係即裝者、合送廠價約一百九十元左右也、新裕亦購供紡二十四支美棉數百件、其他各廠、未聞有訂購也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初殊形活躍、海外棉商在市購買頗烈、因之棉價上漲五六磅音、後因買戶較少、大衆多頭獲利了結、及銀行界賣出而轉軟化、結果收盤、價格較之上日反見降落三四磅音不等、印度棉市昨日連同預測漲一羅比、埃及棉市漲四五十至百餘磅音、利物浦漲十便士、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋軋空回昂　國布後市轉定</h3>
<p>棉布承前市疲勢、晨開仍軟、散戶手貨亟求脫售、按市再廉每疋一角至二角、旋以東疋軋空回昂、故後市亦轉堅定、售盤扯平、交易以本街染廠及批發號較為熱鬧、成交細布·細斜等坯布五六千疋、漂布·色布·印花布·絨布·粗布二百餘件、蘇北及京蕪等地成交藍布·色斜等貨四五千疋、南洋幫略辦粗布·漂布·色布一千數百疋、</p>
<p>東布白貨細布·細斜因本街實銷活動、市氣轉堅、十二磅龍頭細布現盤售開每疋十七元六角半、細斜十六元七角半、各提漲每疋一角半、四君子嗶嘰亦回升至每碼五角七分至七分二厘半、晨市日信洋行開出龍頭藍雙魚及蘇州彩球等脾細布二百數十包、藍雙魚現貨開價每疋十六元三角半、蘇州彩球每疋價僅十六元四角、綜計本客成效白貨有八百餘件</p>
<p>出口、十九日運廈門一百件、運香港一百六十件、運土樂五十件、運暹羅五件、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球低盤迭出</h3>
<p>煤球行情、近日因各廠營業競爭、互相暗跌、低盤迭出、義泰興·國華煤球·日昨廠又跌兩元、計開同業自車、每噸五十七元、送到五十八元、因而各小廠亦隨之俱下、不敢把持、減輕平民生活負担、實為目前急需、但本街門莊零售價目、頗不一律、每百市斤三元一二角不等、</p>
<h3>糖市　國糖交易轉活</h3>
<p>國糖趨勢雖見平軟、但行號雙方交易已漸活動、昨又開出黃崗青三十五元、半南青三十三元、翻赤三十五元、次之三十二元、共成交三百餘包、洋糖公會劃盤市象平平、微有上落、本棧二四粗由五十一元、外棧貨新到小半元、為五十二元、老貨五十一元半、與前日同、轉口貨仍四十一元半、太古車白B嘜等均乏更動、H嘜車赤略小為四十元、本棉白小半元、一號五十一元、餘照退、本一號冰升五角、為六十二元半、二號六十二元、晶明冰六十四元、</p>

<h3>西報記者視察歸滬　談湘北大勝因果　華軍紀律嚴明作戰勇敢　縣長亦親率游擊隊截擊</h3>
<p>十月上旬、華軍在湘北一帶獲得偉大勝利、各西報記者曾於中宣部招待之下、組織視察團、遄往前錢一帶巡視、頃據甫自重慶返滬之某西報記者語大中社記者稱、華軍此次大勝、其所獲實數倍於台兒莊一役、作戰區域、自湘北展至贛北武寗、面積不下二百五十方哩、前後作戰十日、雖日軍動員之前、曾作一個月之</p>
<p>長期準備</p>
<p>即作戰人數、亦較華軍為多、但華軍卒能運用極巧妙之戰略、將其掃數擊潰、日軍不僅絕未前進一步、且有數處反較先前後退數英里之遙、當十月二至五日間、日軍已爲華軍截成數段、當日軍司令岡村決定</p>
<p>下令撤退</p>
<p>時、已無出傅達其命令、不得已乃用飛機傳達、但該機又在通城附近山中撞毀、故亦未能完成其使命、實則各綫日軍、早已於十月二日起、自動狼狽後退矣、華軍此次獲勝之原因、除戰略巧妙外、尙有以下三點、（一）將士用命、當日軍初次進攻時、</p>
<p>其勢頗銳</p>
<p>嗣有華方縣長二人、親率游擊隊五千名猛烈截擊其後隊、使首尾無法相顧、聲勢遂挫、（二）佈置周密、事前華軍已將新牆河以南各公路、悉數破壞、設使日軍到達該地後、機械部隊即無法活動、作戰力乃大减、且因運輸困難、士兵</p>
<p>給養不足</p>
<p>乃尤感困苦，（三）軍紀嚴明、所有任該省作戰之華方部隊、無不紀律嚴明、作戰勇敢、雖受傷數處、仍力戰不退、且與民衆密切聯絡、甚至自動協助農民耕種、農民亦自動代爲抬運傷兵及擔任嚮導工作、綜觀前綫華軍、不僅士氣振作、軍械充實、即作戰經騐、亦遠較日軍爲豐富、前途殊可樂觀、</p>

<h3>僞警槍擊英人汽車　英領已提抗議　根據警務處之詳報　英領署向偽方抗議</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、駐滬英總領署某領事昨（十七日）晚吿記者稱、關於星期三日夜十時地豐路槍擊事件、英總領事已向「上海市長」傳筱庵提出抗議云、按此抗議之提出、乃因「市府」某警並無顯著理由</p>
<p>或發警吿</p>
<p>逕向駕汽車之某英僑開槍懷響之故、公共租界警務處對於此事之詳報、係於昨日午後遞交英領著、英當局加以硏究後、即向「市府」提出抗議、槍擊事件之經過如下、某英僑駕車循地豐路自北向南行、至大西路口、見「市府」警察一名立邊道上、但該警未發令車停止之手勢、故英僑</p>
<p>繼續驅車</p>
<p>前駛、但車未抵路杪、突聞步槍聲一響、槍彈一枚、呼嘯飛過車旁、英僑未傷乃加速駛入麥琪路、英軍當局旋得報吿後、要求「市府警局」予以解釋、但昨日</p>
<p>尚無答覆</p>

<p>據米市塲各行號方面消息、決無匱乏之虞、現國米產區除蕪湖全被日商採購外、其他各地如常熟常州無錫蘇州等地、均准米糧運滬調劑、惟因交通濡滯、運輸困難、據悉日內即有大批國米運滬儲藏、現米業團體獎勵販商採運國米、一俟其貨運抵埠、將其售價分別評定、拋售市塲、况各產米區域、存貨充斥、預料半月內滬市米糧存底、將遂漸增加、至商民住戶儲購備用者、現已不少矣、</p>
<p>條漲條落並無依據</p>
<p>昨日下午、米價又漲、據米業中人云、近來小戶購囤擁擠、且有資力雄厚者、天肆買進、而秈米漲價後、粳米水漲船高、又不得不追隨步趨、考其實際、滬上白粳充斥故近滬市米價、並未趨於正軌、</p>
<p>販米日人屍骨發現</p>
<p>日人佐籘金司、於本年三月間來滬、利用特殊環境、在閘北東寳興路開設一佐藤汽車公司、並於附近另設一米舖、以資牟利、雖僅數月、盈餘頗豐、每月必三度前往滬西虹橋一帶鄉村中、收買食米、本月十五日上午十一時許、該日人復率同空卡車三輛、赴虹橋收米、不意行經虹橋路唐家行附近時、突遇手持盒子砲之壯漢四人、當被勒令停車、並將該日人拖下、挾之而去、事後雖經日軍派隊搜查、亦無下落、直至十六日下午、始有人發現其屍首已在鎮外一小河中浮、乃由日方撈至岸上收殮</p>
<h3>英美日會議　僅屬傳說</h3>
<p>即須磨亦不知</p>
<p>大陸報云、日方昨（十七日）傳寇爾爵士詹森與加藤不久將在滬舉行三角會議一說、未能自美英人士方面獲得證實、據日方消息聲稱、美英日三國駐華大使行將會晤、檢討與中國有關的東京對華盛頓及倫敦之關係、該訊指出、英大使之返滬、非僅巧合而已、美大使亦已離渝、今在香港、首途來滬云、同時、猶憶日外務省發言人須磨星期四日晚在百老滙大厦招待外籍新聞記者時、曾稱渠絲毫不知上海將有此項談判云、惟日方消息、傳英政府對於擬撤退華北英軍事、已通知各國、包括日本在內、但未通知重慶方面、雖重慶已熟知英國此種決定、但未接通知一點、頗可重視云、</p>
<h3>旅歐華僑相率返國　荷蘭華僑首批亦已抵滬　開戰後經營困難多失業</h3>
<p>自歐洲戰起、德國與比何兩國之局勢漸趨緊張後、荷花國政府亦策極備戰、致我國旅居荷蘭之僑商、營業大遭打擊、因生計日迫、均紛紛準備來華、首批荷蘭僑胞胡毅民潘銘賢等四十一人、已於十四日搭康鐵佛四號與法國華僑同輪抵滬、均係原籍浙江之溫州青四瑞安等處、久居荷蘭、從事小本經營之地毯及洋廣貨商、抵滬後因人地生疏、由溫州旅滬同鄉會招待在旅館寄寓、擬候輪赴甬轉往溫州、</p>
<p>大批僑胞準備回國</p>
<p>據招待該返四華僑之溫州同鄉會林覺新君語新聲社記者、旅居荷蘭之浙籍華僑、約有二千餘人、在中日戰事未發生以前、大都以販賣日貨爲業、迫中日戰起、我國旅外華僑抵制日貨、同時各國亦禁止日貨進口後、荷蘭華僑亦即改售其他洋貨、或逕向中國採辦國貨、運往荷蘭銷售、雖成本浩大、獲利甚微、但都自願節約、刻苦經營、及歐戰發生、各種貨物來源稀少、兼之外人購買力薄弱、致使營業一落千丈、目前在荷經商華僑、已屬無利可圖、故大都均準備返國、此次來滬者、爲數不多、尙有大批僑胞、正紛請領事署簽發護照、準備候輪回國、</p>
<p>旅法華僑詳述概况</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晤旅法返國之華僑葉廷桓君、據談、法國自歐洲戰事發生後、國內適齡男子、均徵調服役、致旅居法國從事工商業之個僑、均分別被邀赴法國工廠作工、過去在法國工廠作工者、其工資每小時約有七至十二法郞、戰時以後、工廠方面因緊縮開支、工資减低、最近除供給膳宿外、每人每天僅發給五法郞、較戰前相差甚鉅、故華僑在工廠作工者、生計已無法維持、至於從事商業之華僑、亦因各種貨物來源稀少、銷路銳减、無形中已成停頓狀態、我國旅法華僑、爲數甚多、此次受歐戰影響而失業者、已不在少數、如歐局愈趨惡化、放外華僑之生計前途、勢將陷於不堪設想之境地、現大部份華僑均準備返國、惟戰時旅行不便、耗費又鉅、望使領館方面能設法救濟、俾華僑得以便利回國、</p>

<h3>弒父案上訴理由書　上訴要點　原審係根據從一處斷　對心理變態未予鑑定　周經氏幫助罪嫌欠充</h3>
<p>轟動一時之殺父逆倫巨案、自經第一特院傳琳推事判決逆子周欽吉·周欽祥·共同殺害直系血親尊親屬、各處死刑、其母周經氏帮助損壞尸體處有期徒刑二年六月、各情已數誌本報、茲悉周經氏及其兩子欽吉·欽祥、奉判後、均表示不服、延請楊凛知·葉少英·楊思誠·姜屛藩等律師、向高二分院提起上訴、共上訴理由書、業已於昨日向高二分院呈遞、茲探錄於下、爲補陳上訴理由事、緣周欽吉等被訴殺人及帮助損壞尸體一案、前接判決、業於法定期內聲明上訴在卷、茲補述上訴理由於後、</p>
<p>從一處斷</p>
<p>（一）關於上訴人周欽吉周欽祥共同殺直系血親尊親屬部份（下稱上訴人等）、查廢止死刑爲輓近刑事政策、學者所提倡、我國雖未可遽從、然减少絕對死刑之適用、以爲廢止死刑之準備、此則比較歷决刑法所可得而言者、舊刑法第二百八十四條、以殺人之犯、意出於預謀、及以支解折割或其他殘忍之方法殺人者、處以唯一死刑、本法</p>
<p>將此規定</p>
<p>刪除、並以無期徒刑爲選擇刑、其法意所在、亦無非欲减少絕對死刑之規定、充分發揮相對的罪刑法定主義之精神而巳、然則於量刑之際、固不可不愼重酌科也、本案上訴人等對於殺害尊親屬之事實、固經自承不諱、但其殺人行爲、絕非用殘忍方法、至損壞尸體、完全爲預防犯罪發覺起見、縱令所用方法、涉於殘酷、亦只毀尸部份應從最高度刑量刑、而依最高法院二十一年非字第七號</p>
<p>判例要旨</p>
<p>認為即　殺人之結果從一重處斷、殺人係重罪、即應從殺人罪論科、殺人未用殘忍方法、即無就殺人罪科最高度刑、並將刑法第五七條所定量刑標凖、槪不予以審酌之理、原審除從一重處斷外、不顧其他種種關係（待後詳述）、而據以爲處以極刑之理由、此則難資折服者一</p>
<p>心理變態</p>
<p>（二）查精神喪失人之行爲不罰（刑法第十九條第一項）、又心神耗弱人之行爲减輕本刑（同法第十九條第二項、按本條兩項規定、同指精神有障碍者而言、但程度不一、不全失心神作用者、有因耗弱而僅爲心神遲鈍者、此爲現代各國刑法典及醫學家所公認之事實、本法於全失心神作用者之行爲、旣認爲心神喪失人、不予處罰、而於較輕的</p>
<p>心神遲鈍者之行爲、若全與心神健全者同科、未免有失法意、故本法對於心神耗弱人之行爲、旣不科以通常之刑、又不全免其刑事責任、而規定可减輕本刑、其意甚明、又按外國刑法典、有多類似之規定者、如意·日·丹麥·瑞典·西班牙等國刑法典列有心神耗弱之條文、一九〇五年萬國刑法學會議、亦通過對於心神耗弱人之犯罪、應科以較輕之刑、本案上訴人等</p>
<p>平日行為</p>
<p>旣無惡習、殺書之動機、又非圖產、而終於鑄成大錯者、半固由於先天之心神耗弱、半亦由於敎育之未能糾止、關於前者、可於上訴人等父母兩系方面見之、就父系方面調查、被害人生前曾於民國七八年間服務商務印書館、歷時一年有餘、容貌冷酷、舉動乖僻、對同事亦鮮周旋、（按余華龍律師曾與同事可以傳訊）、其女欽珠（即上訴人等之姊）、亦肯其父（可以傳訊學校當局）、此次案發、且曾一度</p>
<p>神經錯亂　亦經捕房律師陳明在卷、又據調查所得、知被害人之上代、均患極重之肺結核、在醫理上與心神障碍、允有關係、（參照司法行政部法官訓練所犯罪心理學第十五頁）、就母系方面調查、則其姨母（即周經氏之妹）亦向有痴疾、親友咸知、準斯以觀、被害人一家親屬、率多患心神耗弱之精神病、自不難想像而得、但此屬法醫學之範圍、上訴人等平時是否確有</p>
<p>此項疾病　自應詳細調查、由專門醫家加以鑑定、始能論擬、（最高法院十七年上字第三〇六號判例參照）、原審竟對此項犯罪最大之因素、恝置不問、徒爲倫理觀念與社會輿論所箝脅、即行草草宣判、亦與職權調查之能事有所未盡、關於後者之敎育問題、查上述之精神病、本有心神喪失、及心神耗弱之不同、前者即神經系受有損傷之謂、而後者則僅屬</p>
<p>變態心理　在神經系方面、未必受有損傷、有此種疾病之人、大都身體虛弱、心力茶疲、其神經系祗有一個固定觀念、而與其他以整恫人格爲背景之理智觀念、往往不能互相節制、易言之、此種人、率多與社會人羣相隔絕、祗知有己、不知有人、其平日之意志行爲、是否與社會生活相容、往往漢不相關、祗知生我者友、</p>
<p>害我者讐　此在身心發育健全者、即自能主宰其日常之意志與行爲、與社會生活相適應、在身心發育不健全者、猶如燈蛾撲火、往往身不由主、常被環境之刺激所支配、而爲感情衝動之奴隸、糾正此種身心病態之方法、實惟敎育是賴、蓋敎育能變化氣質、糾正此種病人、犧牲較近較小之志行、以求較遠較大之幸福、今上訴人等對於先天之心神耗弱、是否有濃厚之</p>
<p>遺傳關係　固待篕定而後明瞭、然觀於上訴人等（一）身體虛弱、（二）生活孤獨｜（三）態度沉　種種情狀、實已充分顯露其心神障碍之病態、再論敎育之糾正、端賴家庭敎育與學校敎育相輔而行、關於前者、我國數千年雖以孝立團、然究之儒家之倫理觀念、亦並非指片面之義務而設敎推、此可於孟子「君之視臣如土芥、則臣視君如寇讐、」「恩足以保四海、不推恩無以保妻子」等語見之、慈與孝、名雖異、而同爲</p>
<p>天性則一　兩者實爲對待名詞、父而能慈、則子亦能孝、子之不孝、由父之不慈、然則父有不慈、子固可以不孝、所謂種瓜得瓜、種豆得豆者是也、今上訴人等所處之家庭、因被害之凌虐冷酷、視同陌路、日積月漸、自毀其天性之親、不但不能糾正上訴人等心理之變態、反使怨恨之持續長大、被上訴人等即不惜在心神障碍之際、不問手段而排擠其家庭幸福之障碍、推原其故、蓋其斤斤以求之生趣、無理智以相節制也、至於</p>
<p>學校教育　除學術之外、對於倫理問題、往往避免檢討、以致上訴人等對是非順逆之義、缺乏相當之認識、平時因遺傳之個性冷僻、又無深交師友可以切磋糾正、變化其氣質、是其個性有如凝固之寒冰、藏於冰窖、永無融化之機會、終於造成此次驚駭社會之慘案、申言之、即上訴人等之犯罪行爲、在家庭敎育與學校敎育亦應分負其一部之責任、竊思上訴人等罪固十惡不赦、然依上開演明、實爲</p>
<p>封建家庭　之犧牲者、且犯罪之動機、旣非圖產、犯罪之目的、又爲救母、故依刑法第五十七條科刑輕重之標準、即使鑑定上訴人等心力健全、亦無處以極刑之必要、據上論述、原審科刑旣不鑑定其心那變態、又不問其情狀可以憫恕與吾、竟處以唯一死刑、殊覺未當、此則難資折服者二、</p>
<p>帮兇問題</p>
<p>（三）關於上訴人周經氏帮助損壞屍體部分、（下稱上訴人）、查刑法上之帮助犯、以對於正犯犯罪事實具有認識、而加以助力之謂、早有二十一年最高法院上字第三九號判例在案、本案上訴人對於其子損壞屍體、事前旣不知情、當時亦未在塲、自不應貿然論罪、至於其周欽吉等、不利於已之陳述、如審判</p>
<p>筆錄所載　一周欽吉答、我弟隨隨時到母親房中吿知一切、隨後母親到父親房中我弟與我即提議如何屍身處置等語、不但不能採爲上訴人帮助之證據、且適足以反證預謀之當時、上訴人正在探望屍體、並未在場參與計劃、不待煩言而明、又觀於周欽吉所供「我們兄弟同至房內商議將屍體發落、但無結果」之語、尤見上訴人縱使在塲、其參與謀議者、實爲其子周欽吉等、而謀議之事項、亦僅云屍體如何發落、並未提及支解之計劃、夫</p>
<p>發落屍體　之語、普不一定是指支解、即殮葬亦屬發落屍體之方法、此按其語氣、乃當然之解釋、退一步言、縱使其子當時有毀屍之語、然當時旣商無結果、是其對於其子支解屍體之事實、顯無認識、安能推定其已表同意、並有帮助行爲、且當上訴人悲痛惶恐、精神可信度錯亂之下、又安能知其必有所視、必有所聞者乎、原審以上訴人在塲、必屬預問、顯見懸想臆斷、决查同謀應有積極行爲、今上訴人當其子</p>
<p>謀議之際　旣不從旁附和、又無言詞表示讚助、原審以單純之沉默、認爲帮助積極之行爲、亦與刑法從犯之原則相悖、又查上訴人黎明卽下樓（審判筆錄參照）、當下樓時、共子早已出門、待後回家上樓後之一切行爲、上訴人旣未隨同上樓、自無所謂知情、更談不到帮助、原審謂上訴人之不上樓、係在樓下廚房內絆住女傭｜亦嫌空洞推測、蓋監視之作用、無非阻止案外人</p>
<p>知情喊四　而已、然案外人當時究竟有無需要上樓、以及上訴人有無阻止情形、原審求予傳案訊明、亦有未合、至於鑰匙或係其子事發後臨時所交、上訴人當時並不知其所以然、豈得以上訴人事後知情不報爲理由、而判處罪刑、况上訴人目夫、母性如何再能忍心、人感物、無折夫賠之、亦偉大母愛所、所不得已也、此則折服、</p>
<p>死獄求生</p>
<p>總之上訴人等、年事尙轻、意志未定、心神旣屬耗弱、教育又少糾正、祇只本其固執單純之觀念、甘冒大不韙之罪名、蓋其平日旣不能幹父之蠱、又不忍視母之死、其父旣已自毀其天性、有你已等無你、又因其母或竟被父虐待致死、恐有母或成無母、故上訴人等認為你在則母全在於救母、衡情投理、上訴人等</p>
<p>犯罪行為　均非出於故意或惡意、此即司馬邐所謂「臣弒君、子弒父、非一旦一夕之故、其實皆以為書為之不知其議」之意也、且當戰爭劇烈之時、對於心卹耗弱之人、尤易感受激刺、往往認死之一字、極其平常、西哲尼采、亦認「磯爭能養成憤惡情感所激出之不採人而施之心理」、是以渝鴃訴人等非但為封建社會之犧牲者、亦即為戰爭時代之犧牲者、</p>
<p>寧不可憫　辯護入對紛、此逆倫大案所以不憚再三、曉曉繪啄者、亦由歐陽修之父「死獄求生」之一念、希翼在法鸞情理之中、有所發明而已、不然、在此非常時間、上訴人等身犯逆倫大案、徵之國家刑憲、衝之社會興情、凡百派懦於嘛統醴教之倫、皆曰可殺、皆曰殺亦不足以蔽其辜、辯護人奪肯獨排眾議、為社會所指自耶、費亦認為伕撤上有「情有可原妝罪有應臧」之條也、據上陳述、</p>

<h3>誰說中國沒有發明家</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>中國的科學落後，毋須說得了。可是歷史上的光榮事實，不容我們蔑視，也可以使我們急起直追的。現在外國許多重要的東西，却是中國從前所發明的。如：今日航業上不能缺少的指南針，還是幾千年前黄帝所發明；印刷術的發明，也是我國最早，在五代時候，馮道就發明木板印刷，到宋朝有畢昇發明活字版，明朝又有華燧安國創銅活字版。其他我們日用的瓷器，戰爭用的火藥等，都是甲國人發明的。</p>
<p>近年來，我國人對於科學硏究的興趣，也日見濃厚，新發明的物件也有不少，誰說中國沒有發明家呢？如今且舉出十五人如下：</p>
<p>（一）鍾靈發明鍾式印字機和壓力油燈。（二）湯仲明發明木炭汽車。（三）舒震東發明華文打字機。（四）邱伯安發明多絲電泡。（五）烟台電報局水綫工程師王柏年發明華文電報機。（六）新加坡華僑王振山發明化油機汽車。（七）河南扶溝姜師中學司同貞發明新式水車。（八）雲南玉溪馮永康發明絲織機。（九）北平隋少博發明舒棉機。（十）中國黑白社向慧庵發明千分之一秒鎂光機。（十一）靑島膠濟鐵路工程師張名藝利用鋼末廢料鐵成生鐵。（十二）陝西人紀整綱發明新式减力軋花踏板。（十三）北平國立研究院物理硏究所所昌錢臨照發明電壓水晶。（十四）杭人鄭苗卿發明防火布。（十五）留學生黃超在德發明竹製火藥。</p>
<p>聰明的小朋友！發明家並不是什麽異乎尋常的超人，也不是只有超人才會發明，只要你們能留心觀察，精密實騐，耐性堅强，不怕沒有成就。努力吧！成功在期待着你們呢！</p>
<h3>我們應有早起的習慣</h3>
<p>— 奮飛</p>
<p>天氣漸漸地冷起來了，各位對於暖烘烘的被窩，必定又要戀戀不捨了，但是，我們在馬路上，時常看見外國的小朋友，身上穿得很單薄，腿又露出，挺起了胸膛，背着書包，精神非常飽滿，向着學校進發！回頭看看我們的小朋友，却似小老頭子一·樣，身上穿得很厚，行動遲慢，一點沒有「朝氣」。這是什麼原因？我敢說，這就是體格不健全的明證。一方面是父母不健全與先天的不足，一方面，是沒有注意體育的重要與嚴格的鍜鍊。</p>
<p>外面呼呼的北風，刮得很大，時間尙早呢？我等一會兒起來吧！的確睡在熱烘烘的被窩裏，誰都覺得舒適，不過，光陰的得的得，一秒一分一刻，只是向前飛跑，壁上的時鐘，在噹！噹！……敲六下了！一部分的腦筋在報吿你，現在是應該起來了！不要睡了！若再不起來，你便又要「遲到」了！敏兒終於掙扎了起來，穿上了衣服，吃了早粥，背着書包，走到馬路上，和那怒吼的北風，互相搏鬥！小朋友們，你們可有搏鬥的精神嗎？我希望你們不要怕冷，趕快養成「早起」的習慣，非但可以鍜鍊體格，而且還可以利用早上的光陰，溫習各種功課，何樂而不爲呢？你看！外國的小朋友，他們會怕冷嗎，他們所以能够抵抗冬天的嚴寒，無非是身體的强弱的關係，你如果身體健全，當然也可以抵抗寒冷，身體的健全，就是要平日加以鍛錬，在冬天的時候，是我們鍛鍊的最好的機會。</p>
<p>父兄們！你們不要溺愛自己的兒女，要知道鍜鍊體格，只有在道個時候，你看，各處的江北小孩子，他們大多赤足，但是我從沒有看見他們生過「凍瘃」，同時，我也從沒有看見他們到了夏天要生「熱癤」，這不是鍜鍊出來的證據嗎？我更沒有看見他爲了寒冷凍得「生病」，所以我們要像江北小孩子一樣，和寒冷搏鬥！使我們孱弱之軀，鍜鍊成强健之身，在冬天，必須有「早起」的習慣。有人說得好，「起得早，身體好」。眞是不錯的啊！</p>
<h3>小科學</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>把篩過晒乾的細砂從漏斗中漏下，一會兒下面便堆成一個圓雜形的砂塔。這砂塔堆到相當高以後，漏下的砂，便從塔的兩旁滑下來，塔所占的地方也漸漸廣闊；因此我們始終造不出一個高而尖的砂塔。</p>
<p>科學家吿訴我們說，砂堆的塔，斜坡是不能超過三十度的。（三十度就是開得像方桌角頭三等分那樣大。）</p>
<h3>利之所在，趨之若騖，結果是等於零。</h3>
<p>— 儆予作</p>
<h3>新年的賭—明兒避難記之四十三—</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>村裏人在這短短的新年期中，儘量的玩他們所要玩的玩意兒，可是在這樣偏僻的村子裏，除了幾爿破舊的雜貨店外，簡直我不出一爿茶館飯店，那裏有什麽戲館，遊戲塲？要是自小生長在那裏，從沒有出過鬥的村裏人，恐怕連夢中也不曾夢見到。那麼在新年裏玩些什麼呢？到底有些什麼玩意來點綴這個新年呢，除了間或有幾聲爆竹聲，門牆上的新桃符，和人身上的新衣服外，骰子聲和竹牌聲竟作爲他們惟一的新年的點綴品，惟一的消遣品。</p>
<p>祠堂門前，空曠的廣塲上，添了不少的大人小孩，圍住在各式各樣的小攤旁，這也是新年特殊的景象。那邊的人羣，熱鬧異常，熙熙攘攘，談話聲，笑聲……充滿了它四周的空氣，似乎那邊有一大羣的蜜蜂在嗡嗡地呌着一般的閙猛。小攤都是那些在村子裏家境十分富裕的人家，見到這一年一度的好機會，便想出這種新花樣希望在新年裏可以賺一筆　，是件輕而易舉的事，費了些小小的本錢，買了些花花綠綠的糖桀，把一條桌子洗刷得乾乾凈爭，更舖起潔凈而鮮艷的五色紙，還想出些什麽轉輪，抽籤，摸頭彩……總之，這些都是孩子們所喜歡的，又是適合他們的心理，因爲這些玩意都是用少量的金錢，可以得到很多的糖果，那個不高興去幹呢？那些無知的小孩子們都被它吸住得跑不開，團團的團住在攤子旁邊，似乎一羣蜜蜂被那甜蜜的花朶引誘住了一般，一面他們史向父母討錢，可是錢終輸完了，而糖倒還沒有上口，因此那邊也時常有些哭聲夾雜在笑和談話的混合聲中，竟變了一個不合節拍的音樂三重奏。</p>
<p>再走過去一些，便是大人們的新年俱樂部：一張一張很多的桌子排列在一條不通的路邊。那邊的人也是一小羣一小羣的圍住在桌旁，桌子上鋪着雪自的檯布，一個衣服很整齊的人坐在那兒在砌牌，站立的人把鈔票和角票押着，接着兩粒骰子一擲，很迅速的把牌分開來，各自的把它翻開來，那坐的人把桌上的鈔票「吃」的「吃」，「配」的「配」。那是在推牌九輸贏看上去是獨大的，因爲桌面上全是些角票和鈔票。再過去的一羣，一陣的骰子和碗的撞擊聲，那是在擲「老鴉」</p>
<p>明兒很起勁的在走馬看花，他在擲骰子的一羣中，竟站立了好一會兒，眼見得一個人已贏了一大疊的鈔票，還站在那裏不走，還把他所有的鈔票，押在桌上，那做「莊」的人已輸得差不多了，見他還在押，便站了起來，很用力的擲着骰子，他面上當然現出一副難看而難以形容的臉相。當他把骰子擲下去的時候，又喚着很緊脆的音調，希望把那鈔票「吃」掉，而那押的人也喚出倒采的聲音，無形中他們倆爲金錢而鬥爭着，那時的情勢也是相當的緊張。這是一個最緊要的關頭，要是做「莊」的贏了，他非但可以翻本，還可以贏錢。那押的人費了好多的氣力，雖贏了這許多錢，還不能滿足，更作這孤注一擲，希冀得到加倍的錢，他們倆都是具有一股野心，因此這六顆骰子在碗底打着旋，它們的轉動，和他們的得失是有莫大的關係。他們的兩雙眼珠同樣很銳利的射在碗裏，而他們的心理都是絕對的不同。這是一副爲金錢而現出窮兇極惡的醜相。金錢！金錢！眞是好東西！一方面却是壞東西！</p>
<h3>藍矮子（九）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>阿麗忙道：「對不起，我—我委實不知道」。那矮子們也同聲說道：「是啊，我們也不知道」。阿麗微笑道：「你們的意思，可是說不知道我的名字嗎？那麼我先來吿知你們，我呌阿麗！」矮子們仍是呆瞧着，好像沒有聽得似的。阿麗便又重複了一句道：「我呌阿麗！」</p>
<p>矮子們接口道：「阿麗阿麗，好一個名兒！你只要呌我們藍好了。我們此刻一齊到這裏來，是要請你到我們村子裏吃夜飯的。你來吃過之後，就可知道我們的菜倒也做得不錯呢一阿麗見他們如此客氣，很不安的說道：「謝謝你們的好意，要是路不遠的話，我一定前來奉陪，不過我怕吃不下什麽東西罷了。委實說，我並不覺得飢餓。」說時又從袋裏取出一片麪包來道：「况且我這裏也有麪包，因爲剛才喝咖啡時吃不下，所以隨身帶着的。」</p>
<p>當下就有幾個矮子走近過來，很注意的察看那片麪包，他們伸手撫摸着，又把鼻子嗅了又嗅，內中有一個矮子更伸出舌子來，舐了一下；兩個眼睛睜得很大，現出詫異的神情，瞧着阿麗說道：「這東西並不好。」阿麗忙道：「我却覺得沒有什麽不好。這是鄉間所做的麪包，你要是住在那邊村子裏，也要吃這東西的。</p>
<p>那兩個矮人並不注意到阿麗的話，却轉過身去，銳聲呼道：「你們一齊來！」其餘的矮人們，同聲答應着，那聲音也一樣的尖銳；當下阿麗很詫異地瞧見他們一齊走來。但是那在桶上的矮人並不跳下，仍在桶上一壁過來；那屈着膝的，也仍然屈着膝過來：卽翻着筋斗的，也仍然一壁番一壁過來，一霎時間，那些矮人全都聚集在伊的脚邊了。</p>
<p>阿麗抬起眼來一看，忽見前面一棵樹上，掛下一件大袍來，模樣兒很像伊伯母的那件旅行衣，而顏色却和那些矮人們的衣服一樣也是淺藍色的。阿麗心中很明白，這件大袍是特給伊穿的。伊立起身來，伸手拏了那件大袍，披在身上，很快樂地自言自語道：「如此我一定可以經歷些新奇有趣的事情了。」</p>
<p>於是那些矮人們開始前進了—不，這不能說是前進，只能說是向前蠕動着，阿麗却夾在他們的中間，讓他們簇擁而前，肩上披着的那件藍袍，被風飄動着，分外好看。大家自管趕着路，連一句話都不說都不說。那時天色已晚，森林中越發的黑暗起來，但是阿麗並不吃驚。他們走了好一會，末後便　見前面有一小點明亮的藍光，在那裏閃動；這藍光似乎比螢火不了多少，在黑暗中却分外的亮晶晶地。矮人們一見了這藍光，就喊了一聲，喊聲剛停，又開始唱起歌來。你道他們唱的是什麼呢？阿麗先還不相信，仔細地一聽，却的的確確唱着英國的一支名曲「家，甜蜜的家。」最奇怪的，他們唱得很美，並且活像是伊伯母的聲音。</p>

<h3>關於「麒派大會串」</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>關於難民救濟會本月二十七日起演唱義務戲四天，而將根據我的建議，舉行「麒派大會串，」一天，已誌前報。昨（十七日）下午四時，難民救濟會負責當局虞洽卿袁履登二氏爲了此事，特假大西洋菜社，宴請票伶兩界，排定日程與節目如左：</p>
<p>十一月二十七日　日場　滑稽彈詞崑曲會串　夜場　名伶會串</p>
<p>二十八日　日場　申曲　會串　夜場　票友會串</p>
<p>二十九日　日場　話劇　會串　夜場　明星會串</p>
<p>三十日　日場　名伶　會串　夜場　票友會串</p>
<p>上面節目中二十七日夜塲之名伶會串、係完全更新舞台角色，由吳素秋領銜演出。三十日日塲之名伶會串，即擬用」麒派大會串，」惟商討結果，以「麒派大會串」僅限於麒派，範圍較狹，不如舉行會戲制，由各戲院之演員聯合演出，較爲熱閙，於是三十日之日塲名伶會串，乃改爲會戲，戲碼業已排定，大約爲下列三齣戲：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>袁小樓　王少樓　李仲林　劉漢臣　高雪樵</p>
<p>黃寶岩　陸毛豹　徐雲霆　王富英　王桂卿</p>
<p>三本鐵公雞</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>雪又琴　王熙春　張淑嫻　毛劍秋</p>
<p>張淑蘭　鑫素雯　于素蓮　李雪枋</p>
<p>八演五洞花</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>趙如泉（關公）　周信芳（黃忠）　劉坤榮（魏延）</p>
<p>戰長沙</p>
<p>上面之戲碼，劍經多方考慮而後决定，大約不致再有更動。不過照上而之戲碼論，有二大缺點：（一）時問只有十三刻鐘，會戲以往規例，向演六小時，相差未免太多；（三）大軸之「戰長沙，」雖係目前一齣紅戲，但上次虞府堂會飾魏延者爲袁世海，此戲之紅，紅在三人功力悉敵，今易袁世海爲劉坤榮，相差不可以道理計，此戲之演出，可斷定决難媲美周趙袁前决所演也。</p>
<p>至於所謂之麒派大會串，衆料必能號召，且能引起興趣，故决定舉行，惟此次之四天義務戲暫且不演，內定下月七日假座天蟾舞台公演，戲碼大約與九月一日本刋所擬相同，惟加入趙如泉趙松樵王椿柏諸人，易名爲「文武老生大會串，」兩趙一王將合演「高平關」一戲，而同時更將由名票孫蘭亭張中原在其俊諸君，客串麒派戲一齣，名爲「文武老生大會串，」實際仍以「麒派會串」爲本，想將來公演必能轟動劇壇也</p>
<h3>閒話「金玉滿堂」　大華大戲院開幕獻映</h3>
<p>— 夢</p>
<p>「金玉滿堂」是大華大戲院開幕第一張片子，也是童星米蓋羅納與裘蒂珈倫初度合作的片子。</p>
<p>他倆在這部片中，有着非常精彩的演出。尤其是米蓋羅納的演技，他不但保持過去在「兒童樂園」中精湛的表演，還把他從未演過的絕技，施展出來。鋼琴彈得熟極而流，邊彈邊唱，充分發揮他音樂的素養。另外塗黑了臉，唱著熱烈情調的歌詞，比起埃第康泰的演唱，簡直不相上下，最使人拍案呌絕的本領是，效學克拉克蓋博爾和里昂巴里穆亞的口吻與神情，「活拓活像」，出塲做戲的重頭，可說是米蓋羅納拍影片以來最高的紀錄。</p>
<p>裘蒂珈倫的歌唱，素與狄安娜竇萍，分庭抗禮，她的音調，有甜醉的魔力，她的舞步，有迷戀的熱力；在「金玉滿堂」的演出，和米蓋羅納恰巧凑成一對，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。所有參與助演的演員，都是未成年的男女童伶，在演出方面，非常熱閙與詼諧，從頭到尾，使人笑口常開。</p>
<p>全美電影刊物，一致推薦這部片是近　不可多得的歌唱片，大華大戲院採作開幕片子，可見重視的一斑。</p>
<h3>米蓋羅納蒂珈倫合演「金玉滿堂」…兩小無猜</h3>
<h3>「生財有道」觀感</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>在「日出之前」公演後不久，保聯劇團於上星期日上午在卡爾登又搬演了世界名著「生財有道」、劇本是顧仲彝由莫利哀的「慳吝人」改編的，全劇充滿着諧詼和諷刺的氣氛。首先，我們小得不稱贊導演吳銘先生的處理塲子的手腕，每幕都能抓住觀衆緊張的情緒，灌注着沈痛的語調，從笑聲中迸發體會出來，不過，因爲角色支配的困難，有幾幕沒有理想中那麼滿意。演出方面，炎言的華炳剛，是相當成功的，但動作似乎未能十分鎭靜。銘西的張永慶，也很好，最後一幕却表演得不够眞切。寒雁的傳娘子，太做作，欠自然。廖家艾的華英，太呆板。同華的張阿四，演技却十分老練，內心表演也還深刻，雖然因爲太賣力了，不免有些近於文明戲化。其他燈光佈景化裝，一切都力求簡單，在「祇求無過」的原則下，倒未始不是一個聰明的辦法。</p>

<p>德國對波作戰，不出二十天之內，把波蘭軍隊，疾風掃秋葉一樣擊潰，德國閃電戰術成功的原因，是由於它的空軍比之波蘭不知道優越過多少倍。德國對波作戰的第一流的飛機，達三千架之多，而波蘭所有的飛機，只有三百六十架。希特勒因爲有這樣空軍的優勢，一舉而殲滅波蘭的空軍根據地，達到速戰速決的目的。但對法戰爭，完全與對波戰爭的形勢兩樣。雖則就戰鬥機講，德國在這一方面，比之英法兩國的總數，還要來得實力雄厚，但戰鬥機是可由驅逐機擊落的。這一方面是英法占優勢。英法空軍中驅逐機，除開他們本國製造的外還有一大部分是購自美國。美國寇蒂士廠供給大量的　逐機給英法兩國。美國新中立法修改後，英法由於她們海空航運的比德占優勢，及金融財政上比德國雄厚，以及美國同情英法方面，今後對於美國飛機軍用品的輸入，必然較德國處於有利地位。這對德國的打擊，必然要更大，那是毫無疑問的事。</p>
<p>在這次西歐的空中戰爭中，據英法官方的統計，英法驅逐機的損失是八架，而德國二十四架。那就是一與三之比。轟炸機的損失，則英法較多，這是由於英法想轟炸德國防衛嚴密的軍事中心之故。他方面，德國飛機如作同樣企圖，往英法軍事中心轟炸，其所損失，也必相等。</p>
<p>雙方坦克車的比較</p>
<p>除空軍外，德國另一利器，是機械化部隊，德畫因為其重工業的發達，牠的坦克的制造，極為迅速，其數量也許要超過英法，不過法國的坦克車比德國要占優勢，法國的坦克車比較輕快，十一噸，二十噸及二十八噸的坦克車，外面包着特別鋼鐵裝甲，幾乎是大砲所不能擊穿，這是英法方面的秘密製造，不是德國人所能仿效的。</p>
<p>德國的可能的軍事策略</p>
<p>法國方面旣有這樣優越的空陸戰爭武器，再加那不易攻破的馬奇諾陣綫，可資扼守，以作持久戰，德國要從西綫取攻勢，以殲滅英法的軍隊，而獲得壓倒的勝利，在事實上是不可能的。另出奇計，繞道法國的後方，把英法聯軍擊潰，那末就非借道荷比或瑞士不可，德國集中軍隊於荷比邊境，曾有一度甚囂塵上，德國在必要時，也許有不顧一切，出於這樣行動的可能。到了那時，捲入戰爭的國家必更多，而戰爭的範圍也必更大了。</p>

<h3>趙老太太</h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>……外人所贊美的濟南隊之母……</p>
<p>我國古代的巾幗央雄，史不絕書；但以一個不識字的女子，早已五十八歲，率其子孫三十餘人抵抗異族的侵略，實不多遘。這種「闔第抗戰」，在目下眞値得提倡和仿效。所以趙老太太的被稱爲游擊隊之母，到處受人熱烈歡迎，足見不是盲目崇拜，也不是偶然的事了。</p>
<p>下面趙老太太的照片登載在本年美國出版的亞細亞雜誌上。牠的說明爲「被稱爲游擊隊之母的趙老太太，以演詞鼓勵國人，不下千次，並且爲游擊隊募捐數萬元。她是一個不識字的農婦，在她從前的家鄉，滿洲一個農村中，鼓動農民反抗日本，與游擊隊一同抗戰，迄今不懈。她的兒子趙侗，在中日戰事爆發後，組織軍隊約二萬人，駐河北作戰，該項軍隊與第八路軍極有連絡，其軍官差不多經八路軍訓練過的」。足見外人也很注意了。</p>
<p>老太太的姓名呌趙洪國文，自從民國二十一年二月起，即將家產捐助義勇軍，並且全家加入工作。曾手創華北游擊隊三萬餘，轉戰於東北及華北各省，由長白山脈到太行山脈。她雖有了年紀，惟精神矍鑠，聲如洪鐘。今年二月間乘飛機到重慶，在機塲歡迎者甚衆</p>
<p>在昆明時，省黨部開會歡迎，她出席演講，聽衆有五千餘。她對昆明的記者說：「我不願做家庭的母親，我要做大衆的母親，我把我的兒女子孫都送入游擊隊，我以爲每個做母親的人，都應該把她的兒女送到前綫去，與敵人拚命，每個母親也應加入前綫去」。</p>
<p>古人有句話：「疾風知勁草，亂世出英雄」。當此民族阽危的時候，不但男性民族英雄輩出，女性民族英雄亦聞風而起，這也是因果的必然律罷</p>
<h3>希特勒的遺囑</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>倫敦東郊，近來有一批新奇的販賣書報者，口裏喊着：「阿要看希特勒的遺囑及遺言！」</p>
<p>你如化數辨士，就能買到一份，開首是：「畫家希特勒，引德國入歧途者，歐洲有名的瘋×」恐一旦不測，預立遺囑云云。下面是遺囑中的數節：</p>
<p>「所有信任我的全體德國人民給啞子政府。（意爲全能國家除獨裁者外，其他都是啞子。譯者）」</p>
<p>「所有我的勛章都給戈林。連他自己在內，勳章的重量將使他不勝負帶而屈膝。</p>
<p>「我的奮鬥」一書給阿賽倫，請他重行檢討。」（這大概是該書中駡蘇聯之處頗多的緣故！）譯者」</p>
<p>「我的鬍子給卓別靈，因此物係效彼而蓄的。」</p>
<p>「我的遺囑應由里賓特洛甫及戈林執行，因他們有執行的經騐的。」</p>
<p>最後他需要以避火的石綿棺具成殮，安葬後，德國國會應宣佈「地獄」併入德國版圖，他說：「地獄，我是多方想設法給德國人民的，這是很正當的應屬於祖國。」</p>
<p>經濟常識</p>
<h3>內滙管理</h3>
<p>— 泗幸</p>
<p>我國經濟之發展，向來極不平衡，大部資本，集中於沿海幾個重要都市，而這些資本眞正從事於民族工業者，爲數殊鮮，大都是與外資相結托，搆成了所謂買辦資本。自從抗戰軍興，政府爲疏散資金及建設總後方起見，對於資金及工業之內移，予以極大之獎勵和資助，一般具有遠見的實業家，把工廠遷入內地者，爲數固夥，然因循苟安，託庇租界，逗留迄今，重整舊業者，仍屬不少。再加以各地居民避難來滬，挾以俱來者是大批資金，因此更造成了上海空前的特殊繁榮，也造成了上海龐大的入超數目，這種現象，顯然是極反常而不合理的。迨至最近，政府已深覺此種現象，不應長此任其存在，乃令中中交農四行，組織國內匯兌管理委員會，實施內滙管理，委員會設在重慶四行總行所在地，全國設立分會，附設在中中交農四行內，規定內地滙款至沿海淪陷區如上海天津等處，以購買必需品爲限，並須向匯兌管理委員會申請，說明用途數目匯往地點及買貨商號之證明文件方得通匯。但上海匯至內地者，則予以種種便利，匯往內地不論何處，概不收受匯費，再如上海付以匯劃，內地仍可如數收取現鈔。這管理內滙的辦法，無疑是針對現時反常狀態而發的有效而合理的辦法。</p>
<p>在實施內滙管理以前，內地資金，競向上海逃避，每日由滇，川，湘，桂等處滙往上海者，據統計爲數恒超過十萬元以上，政府對此，亦無通盤辦法，僅在消極方面略示節制，如公債利息改在重慶付現，上海分期貼現，支付匯劃等。迨施行管理以來，內地匯款來滬，較前困難多多，前規定每人每日能匯一千元者，現已减至至多一百元，郵局更祗能五十元，匯率如滇渝等地匯滬者，該地付現鈔一千四五百元，至上海付千元匯劃，如需現鈔，則需加更多之貼水，因此現時內地匯滬者，為數每日已減至二萬元之間。而上海滙往內地者，自內匯管理以來，反形激增，非惟免收滙費，且有升水之利，普通匯至昆明重慶等地，每百元上海祗需付七十元至八十元之譜。</p>
<p>內匯管理的目的有二：消極方面是防止內地資金外流，以為敵資，積極方面是鼓勵滬市資金內移，以備國用。至於上海繁榮的衰落，現在已漸露其端倪，擁有資金者，盍乘此時機，向西南和西北云開癖我們的新天地。</p>
<h3>聾子聽不到警報</h3>
<p>自從歐洲發生戰爭以後，英國倫敦無時不妨德國空軍侵襲，防空設備雖極周到，但警報來時，人民仍得向防空壕中暫避。居民中有夫婦二人皆係聾子，夜間如有警報，往往不能聽聞，頗以爲苦，致函某雜誌問答欄請設法解决，其答語謂：別無他法，只有請鄰人通知而已。此亦五官不健全者之遺憾也。</p>
<h3>戰爭與戰費</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰，交戰國所支出的軍費合計三五〇〇萬萬元，戰事延長時日計一六六五日，每日平均耗費二萬二千四百萬元。其中：</p>
<p>英國　七一九萬萬元（占國富之百分之四六）</p>
<p>法國　五七〇萬萬元（占國富之百分之五五）</p>
<p>德國　六六六萬萬元（占國富之百分之四四）</p>
<p>美國　四六一萬萬元（占國富之百分之九）</p>
<p>日本侵略中國戰費逐年增大，如戰事再延長下去，必有破產之一日。現先把她歷屆對外戰事的戰費來個比較：</p>

<h3>星相業　的面面觀</h3>
<p>— 雨</p>
<p>預言休咎　到處皆有</p>
<p>當每個人失意的當兒，唯一的希望，就是宿命論者所謂命運的轉移，交一部好運，發一票橫財，可以說人同此心，心同此理，於是預言休咎的星相家：應運而繁生。</p>
<p>普通的星相家，大抵沿着馬路租了一間房子，門口寫上了某某命相館或某某設硯處幾個字。有的更寫了一些四六文章的自我介紹詞，總是「幼耽翰墨，長好相術，言休咎於未來，百發百中，如迷津之寳筏，明示方針，諸君欲問前程，務祈光降一試」這一套。起初掛牌的，常用「訪友不遇，暫時設硯於此。」這一種話。在報紙上他登着廣吿，加上本人的照片，以作宣傳的。</p>
<p>星相業的祖師</p>
<p>他們所看的書籍，大概不外四種，就是麻衣相法，柳莊相法，神相鐵關刀，水鏡集。據說麻衣就是陳搏的老師，柳莊就是明代袁忠復，神相鐵關刀是一個老僧呌做雲谷山人做的，水鏡集是范文元所做的。這四部書裏，對於形神，氣色，骨肉，斑痣等等相法，齊全畢備。對於男女間却有着黷著的差異。</p>
<p>星相業的等級</p>
<p>至於拿了一粉筆，在馬路旁的人行道上畫了　隻手，嘴裏講幾個故事，使過路的人駐足旁觀，他隨便拉了一個看客的手，任意的批判和預卜還個人的命運，講完了，便要這個人拿出五分或一角的相金，這也是常見的事，據說這種人稱爲江湖相士，可以分做四種：第一種就是所謂掛張相，他在所到的地方，在牆壁上掛着一幅方面大耳的半身畫像，古老的便是紅頂花翎的肖像，摩登的便是西裝打扮。他可依照着所畫的一切，指示人們的迷津。當他看見了一個過路人便說什麽「尊駕土星生得如此隆厚，早該大發，惜乎面上氣色不甚好看。」過路人聽到了他這一些緊張的口吻，立即止步，生意便成功了。至於　居旅舍，在門口揭示某貴人的畫像的這一輩星相家，也就是別開生面的掛張相。</p>
<p>第二種呌做搶巾相，這一種全無眞實本領，看見有人走過，隨便拉着談相，憑他的三寸不爛之舌，說得天花亂墜，引起旁觀者伸出手來，請他看看，於是一角二角，又到了他的袋子裏去了。</p>
<p>第三種呌做摸骨相，這一種是別樹一幟的相法，根據鐵關刀中相骨秘訣而來，甚至於有不識字的，也靠着摸骨相度日。</p>
<p>第四種呌做量手相，這一種大概擇閙中取靜的地方，指上帶着小銅尺一枝，粗絲線一根，還有一幅畫了二三十隻手的布軸，掛在旁邊，量一量手指的長短，便可以定你終身的榮辱，這是一種最簡捷的江湖相法。</p>
<h3>康定近况</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>康定是西康省省城，位於盧定山之西，冕寗之北，理化之東，丹巴之南，於大雪山脈之南段。地勢凸出海面八千七百餘尺之高原，氣候終年寒冷，人口複雜，商業繁榮，爲西康省商業進出口之總樞紐，並且是中國西南幾省中重要城市之一。</p>
<p>康定市况一斑</p>
<p>康定是漢康藏三族人民雜居之地，因此從前實無法統制，直到最近，纔煥然一新，現在城內有銀行二家，電影院一家，川戲院一家，及規模稍大之飯店及旅館二三家，點綴市面。縣城中最熱鬧的大街，是中山街及中正街，二街分列在城河的東西二岸，有大木橋三座，聯絡二岸的交通。</p>
<p>西康出產一斑</p>
<p>氣候寒冷，雖在夏季，亦須穿上大衣，絨背心，棉襖，皮袍子。夏季最高溫度在華氏三十度，在冬季裏的華氏零度之下二十度。夏季的蔬菜，有蘿蔔，新鮮蠶豆，碗豆，四季豆及二季豆之類。葷腥祗有牛肉及豬肉。但是魚一類的水產動物，當地土人都不吃的。因爲土人亡故之後，都以屍體餵魚，稱爲「水葬」，是康定之奇俗，所以土人以爲「魚」是神聖不可侵犯的動物。</p>
<p>生活頗為昂貴</p>
<p>康定的生活程度，向稱全國之冠，因為交通不便，運輸因難，食糧乃日用品，全仗人力揹運輸入，而且採辨須遠至成都，昆明，雅安等地。因此物價昂貴，而最近幾個月中，因戰事自他省移入康定的居民，日有數百名。因此物價騰貴，生活更見艱難，市上洋貨及消耗品，較上海的售價，要貴七八倍，有的竟貴十餘倍。然而土貨亦因人口突增，百物成為求壺於供，所以亦因之飛漲。即鮮豬肉一斤價一元七八角，麵粉每袋二十多元，米每擔亦須三十多元，洋燭每打二元六角，洗臉面盆每只四元六角，（上海的値一元左右）劣等紗襪，每雙七角，（上海最貴約值二角）皮皂一塊亦須三角，早茶餅乾之類，每磅近二元，菜油每斤九角。因此一個貧民似挑夫走卒之類，每日的生活費，非有一元不可，所以一個富有者的生活開支，竟有令人難以相信者！</p>
<p>西康幣制一斑</p>
<p>康定是西康省貿易的咽喉，輸入以茶爲大宗，每年有數百萬元之鉅；輸出則爲藥材，羊毛，　尾，麝香及食糧等，一切賣買，都用藏洋。最近政府通令西康全省，一切交易賣買，須用法幣。故由西康省銀行發行五角藏幣劵，（見附照片）流通市面，藉以收集藏洋，以整幣制之統一。藏幣一元，約合法幣五角，每角合大銅元十枚，每枚作二百文。</p>
<p>人民服裝一斑</p>
<p>康定人民之服裝，頗多奇特，少數服式，效學漢化。大都是上衣寬大，袒胸露臂，腰掛短刀，足穿長統皮靴，面是褐色，頭繞各色土布。但貧苦者的衣服，亦有衣杉襤褸，滿染油蹟，嗅之令人作嘔！婦女皆身體高大，具有「康健美」的典型。較之弱不禁風的南方女子，竟有天壤之別哩！每當淸早及傍晚，婦女皆背水桶，盛水經過街道者，絡繹不絕。</p>
<p>特種食物酥油</p>
<p>土人皆以酥油茶作為日學飲料，（酥油茶：以酥油及茶打和即成）講究的酥油茶，還加些胡桃肉，浮在茶面，食之覺有淸香的異味。純粹的酥油鍊製，亦相當的淸潔衛生，竟不在上海所售的「美女牌」奶油之下，每天平秤一斤，售藏幣四元四角。（合法幣二元二角）普通以酥油夾在鍋塊裏（大燒餅），代飯或點心，實爲富有滋養料的一種食料。川康人貧者都以珍珠米充作食糧，但富有者仍吃米飯，然而他們煮米的方法，較南方人稍有異處。即先以米用水煮熱，以米湯倒去，再以此米蒸熟。此飯中之維他命，實已全失。故康定人的所謂吃飯，祇吃米的渣滓耳。還有一個大衆的習慣，每人每日祇吃二餐。上午丸時吃午飯，下午三時吃夜飯。餘時大都吃點心，因此店心店林立，（吃點心稱爲「宵夜，」）所以康定人吃的一項消費，實較南方人一旦餐的，要麼費多唉！</p>
<p>富有者每於晚上，利用無綫電收音機，收聽成都交通部無綫電臺的新聞及戰事報吿，但全城的收音機天綫，竟似鳳毛麟角！</p>
<h3>鉬銦　軍用稀有金屬</h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>你曾知道鉬，銦，　，麽？這些金屬將來會同鉻（即克羅米）鉑（即白金）鋁同樣的普通。這三種金屬在軍事上極需要，所以將因戰爭而啟發了一種新工業。</p>
<p>鉏在現在很少，每磅的價値，需英金一鎊。鉗礦只哥羅拉都一處，戰前已爲供不應求的金屬。牠的用處是攙入鋼中，能使鋼免去脆而易折的弱點。鐵甲車，鋼板，砲身等，都需要這種鉏鋼的合金。</p>
<p>錮是比鉛軟，比銀光亮，比鋅輕，絕不生鏽的金屬。六年前每盎斯値六十鎊，現在則只値六鎊了，並有更便宜的趨勢。錮幾乎同蠟一樣，在比體溫略高的溫度中，就會融化，所以彌補虛隙是最用得着，製造飛機是省不去的。在戰前，銅被用作塑模形極好的工具，如雕刻及牙齒等模形，其他如石印術也需要。戰時則代替石膏，用牠扎綁傷兵的斷骨，外科醫生使用石膏的不便，現已完全免去了。</p>
<p>是另一種新發現的金屬，道是從鎂炭化後的菱苦土礦中提出來的。比鋁輕一半，却很耐用。所以製造飛機的引擎及機身，實在沒有比牠最好了。</p>
<p>另外還有一種神秘的金屬呌作鈹，價値頗鉅，要五千金鎊一磅。很不容易提純。牠的用處，除掉做綠玉石的底盤作裝飾品以外，到現在還不曾有旁的發見。礦產中的寳藏，與日俱增，眞令人興「生也有涯，知也無涯」之感呢！</p>
<p>西綫的科學戰</p>
<h3>德軍陣地賽過孔明八陣圖　法軍利用大批猪玀云衝鋒</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>－「透明人」與「機械人」也出現了－</p>
<p>科學愈進步，戰術愈新奇，這次歐戰發生，德軍方用全力攻擊波蘭時候對於西部戰綫，只嚴密戒備，暫取守勢，就利用許多科學方法，佈置着所謂陷穽作戰，牠的奇妙，恐怕比中國舊小說中所描寫的「孔明八陣圖」還要勝過萬倍。據曾經參加華倫德森林攻擊戰的兵士稱述，在該地帶內，無論什麽器具物件都帶有爆發性或通有殺人電流，一經接觸，立即倒斃。例如繫馬的繮繩，放置地上，偶然觸及就會觸電而死，一隻死豚棄於戰地，一旦走近，就會爆發地雷，會有一個法國將士，騎着脚踏車往查德兵屍骸，不料屍身上面，也藏爆發物，突然爆炸，竟而遭難。又如行走草地，脚剛落地，就觸動機關，而使地雷爆發，更可奇的，是要塞地點，縱使德兵逃去以後，也不能冒昧衝入，因爲在他們的防禦物中往往設備着很多的機關槍，利用紅外綫的管理而自動的密集射擊。此外凡屬德軍遺留下來的東西，甚至於草根樹梢，都裝着地雷爆發的機關，使人防不勝防，因此很容易遭受損失。</p>
<p>但是德軍縱有這般奇陣妙計，而法軍的破陣方法却是更有奇趣。他們在未踏入敵陣以前先利用一羣猪羅作為衝鋒隊。讓猪羅到處奔跑，凡有地雷的處所，一經觸到，統統爆發，只不過犧牲了幾隻猪羅，而把敵人陷穽完全攻破，豈非更妙。更有進的，法軍還造作無數的「機械人」使之往前衝鋒，掃除地雷，還有所謂「透明人」則深入敵地，在偵察，攻擊，佔領各戰法方面，也屢奏奇功，像這樣的戰爭眞可說是鬥智不鬥力了。風俗誌異</p>
<h3>九龍的運樞習俗</h3>
<p>— 朱緯</p>
<p>九龍地方，有個有趣的習俗。即棺木不准由樓梯上下，故雖高在六七層之棺木，必須設法沿馬路的窗戶中吊上。入殮以後，仍須由窗戶中縋至馬路。手續旣難，危險亦多。</p>
<h3>識小録</h3>
<p>魚的心房是一個，兩褄類一個，爬蟲類有四個心房的痕跡，哺乳類都是四個心房。</p>
<p>世界最大的樹在印度克爾克的植物園中，樹內可容一萬人，樹高一百呎，周圍八百五十七尺。</p>
<p>眞正能飛行的哺乳動物只有蝙蝠，蝙蝠所以能在黑暗中迅速飛行；並不是靠牠的眼睛，牠的翼有細網狀的神經，能感覺氣流打擊着固體物時所起的最輕微震動，故能暗中飛穿密林而不觸樹。</p>
<p>一切動物中以蝸牛的產地的範圍最大，從海平面向上到喜馬拉耶山的雪綫以上，都有牠們的殖民地，海中也有蝸牛，有人會經從洋面下一萬六千英尺處取得蝸牛標本。</p>

<h3>Continuing the Advance After Capturing Ke County, the Chinese Army in Western Shanxi Approaches Heilong Pass; Japanese Troops Retreating from Xiangning Suffer Heavy Casualties Along the Way; Japanese Invasion of Fangcheng and Qin County in Guangdong Results in Significant Fighting</h3>
<p>Xingji: The Chinese army, having recovered Ke County, continues to advance eastward. On the 17th, it recaptured Hualuo Town by noon and cleared out all remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity. A portion of the Chinese army has now advanced to Heilong Pass, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese. The Japanese troops retreating from Xiangning have been ambushed, intercepted, and attacked at their flanks by various Chinese units along the way, leaving piles of corpses and becoming disorganized. By 11:00 AM, the fighting was most intense around Yitaitou, where the Chinese army destroyed five Japanese vehicles and killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Simultaneously, another unit of the Chinese army moved to encircle and attack, resulting in a complete rout of the Japanese forces. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Xingji: There are rumors that Yuncheng has been recovered by the Chinese army. A large number of wounded Japanese soldiers have been arriving in Quwo in recent days and are being continuously transported to Linfen. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Fencheng: Japanese troops in Yitaitou, north of Fencheng, received reinforcements of about two hundred men from the east on the morning of the 11th, and another eight hundred men by noon. They then moved south to harass the area, encountering fierce resistance from the Chinese army, which inflicted heavy casualties. Furthermore, on the 12th, over a hundred Japanese soldiers in Wulantou were completely annihilated in an ambush by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>If the Japanese Army Invades Guangxi Province, They Will Undoubtedly Suffer a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Chongqing: General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, commented today on rumors of a Japanese invasion of Guangxi Province, saying, "We only fear that the Japanese will not invade Guangxi. If they do, it would simply provide the Chinese side with another opportunity for annihilation. The Chinese side in Guangxi Province may adopt the same strategy as in Shanxi and northern Hunan, with the local people and army cooperating to destroy all roads and move all portable goods as much as possible before the enemy approaches. In this way, the Japanese army will be unable to establish contact and use its heavy weapons." It is also reported that Guangxi Province, in preparation for a Japanese invasion, recently convened fifty-four political work instructors from various parts of the province in Guilin. After six days of discussion, the instructors have returned to their posts to begin preparations. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the situation on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi has become increasingly tense since the Japanese army occupied Fangcheng and Qin County northwest of Beihai. It appears that the Japanese army is currently aiming for Nanning and advancing inland. Nanning is a major town in southern Guangxi, located on the road to Vietnam. It is reported that the Japanese army is not advancing from Beihai but rather moving along the road northwest of Beihai, passing through Fangcheng and Qin County towards Nanning. The Japanese army occupied Fangcheng on the afternoon of November 16th and landed south of Qin County on the same evening. Japanese cavalry and infantry, under the cover of intense artillery fire, immediately attacked Qin County, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. According to Chinese telegrams received here today, the Japanese troops in the Fangcheng and Qin County areas are currently moving north along the road to Nanning. Chinese sources here believe that it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese army to invade Guangxi Province because the border area between Guangdong and Guangxi is mountainous. South of Nanning is Phoenix Mountain, and the border between Guangdong, Guangxi, and Vietnam is the Shiwan Da Shan. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to reports here today, the Chinese army withdrew from Fangcheng on Wednesday evening, and from Qin County on Thursday evening. Before withdrawing, the Chinese army inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese army. At the same time, due to the relentless bombing of both cities by Japanese naval and air forces for forty-eight hours, they were severely damaged and turned to scorched earth. Therefore, it was decided to abandon them and retreat to favorable positions beyond the range of naval heavy artillery to continue the resistance. According to sources from American churches in the area where the Japanese army landed, there are about 30,000 Japanese troops operating in the area, including both army and naval marines. In the past three days, the shelling of cities in the Qinzhou Bay by Japanese warships has been largely ineffective, as it has failed to significantly damage Chinese defenses. This is because naval artillery is primarily designed to target ships and is not suitable for cities. According to Chinese claims this morning, the Chinese army has now withdrawn beyond the range of naval heavy artillery, but the extent of the retreat has not been specified. Foreign experts claim that the range of naval artillery is approximately one to two miles. (Associated Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, stated here today that the Chinese side had anticipated the Japanese landing operation in the Beihai area. The Guangxi Chinese army is eager for the Japanese army to continue to advance, as the conditions there, especially the terrain, are entirely favorable to the defending side. "Our only fear is that the Japanese army will not attempt a deep advance. If the Japanese army continues to advance and penetrate deeply into Guangxi, it would provide us with an opportunity to tie down the enemy in another area. Furthermore, if the Japanese side wants to achieve anything, it will need at least two divisions of troops. But even if the Japanese side uses two divisions of troops, we still have ample strength to deal with them." (Associated Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>The Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee Passes Several Motions, Including Improving the Treatment of Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its sixth meeting on the 18th, chaired by President Chiang. First, the minutes of the fifth meeting were read, and then the following articles were amended and passed: (1) Resolutions on reports on military, political, and educational affairs; (2) Four proposals examined by the military group; (3) Two proposals examined by the economic group; (4) A proposal by Committee Member Ma Chao and ten others to improve the hospitals and treatment for wounded soldiers; (5) A proposal by Committee Member Ma Chaojun and ten others to adjust military and public vehicles to facilitate civilian travel.

<p>Chongqing: Among the various proposals at the Sixth Plenary Session, there are suggestions to establish two new ministries for forestry and water conservancy. Representatives supporting this proposal claim that forestry and water conservancy play a most important role in the construction work in the northwest provinces. Currently, this proposal is still under discussion. Previously, forestry affairs were handled by the Agriculture Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, while water conservancy was handled by the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River Water Conservancy Committees.

<p>National Assembly - Date of Convocation</p>
<p>Chongqing: Because President Chiang advocated for the early implementation of constitutional government, the Sixth Plenary Session will focus on the issue of when to convene the National Assembly. The task of the National Assembly is to formulate a constitution and establish a constitutional government to replace the current period of political tutelage. Previously, the Kuomintang had set November 12, 1937, as the date for convening the National Assembly, but it was postponed due to the prolonged war. After President Chiang urged its convocation, it will be decided this time. It is expected that the committees will set the winter of 1940 as the date for convening the National Assembly. At the same time, the committees have agreed on (1) that the work of selecting representatives in areas under the control of the Chinese government and in the occupied areas must be completed as early as possible before the National Assembly convenes; (2) that the representatives elected in 1937, except for those who have surrendered to the Japanese side, will still be considered valid.

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade and Harass Northwest of Ruicheng</h3>
<p>Luoyang: On the morning of the 13th, three to four hundred Japanese troops from Taiyukou (east of Yongji), along with over five hundred Japanese cavalry, infantry, and engineers, converged at the villages of Dongfu and Xifu, and then advanced to Zhangjiashan in the northwest of Ruicheng, with several aircraft providing support. The Chinese × unit intercepted them at Zhangjiashan Taishan Temple, while another unit maneuvered to flank them from the ×× area on the left wing. After a day of fierce fighting, many were killed. On the morning of the 14th, the Chinese army redeployed troops and launched a bayonet charge, and the Japanese forces, unable to withstand the assault, fled towards Yiyi Town, leaving behind many corpses and other military supplies. The Chinese forces are still pursuing them in victory. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Night Raid Chongqing, Dropping Bombs in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>Chongqing: After a six-week lull, Japanese aircraft raided Chongqing again tonight. Twenty-seven Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing shortly after 6:00 PM, dropping bombs in the suburbs far from the city center. The sound of the explosions was barely audible in the city. The air raid alert was lifted at 7:15 PM. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese aircraft, which had been silent for over a month, suddenly harassed Chongqing this evening. The local air defense command reported that twenty-seven Japanese aircraft, flying upstream along the Yangtze River from Hubei, intruded into Sichuan and then reached the vicinity of Chongqing. The Japanese aircraft then split into two groups, one heading directly over Jiangbei, while the other circled and reconnoitered over the outskirts of Chongqing for a long time before successively flying out from Jiang and around a certain area in western Hubei, heading east. The local air defense command issued an emergency air raid alert, which was lifted after about an hour. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Chinese Army Recaptures Zhanglin Bridge</h3>
<p>Liuhuang: On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army advanced in multiple directions. One route, with over forty Japanese soldiers and a heavy machine gun, invaded the mountainous area north of Shantou, firing fiercely with machine guns at Hailiansu. The Chinese army calmly responded, and when the Japanese army lost effective range, concentrated their fire in a counterattack. In less than an hour, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the assault and retreated. Another route, with about five hundred Japanese soldiers and seven mortars, advanced towards Zhanglin Bridge southeast of Wuyang Mountain, supported by Japanese aircraft. At the same time, Japanese artillery concentrated their fire and shelled the Chinese positions. After fierce fighting until 4:00 PM, the Chinese forces made a strategic withdrawal as their positions were completely destroyed. At night, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a counterattack. By the morning of the 15th, the Japanese army had completely retreated, leaving behind many military supplies. Zhanglin Bridge has been completely recaptured by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Chinese Army Recaptures Laiyang</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Shandong (Delayed): On the 9th, over six hundred Japanese troops from Pingdu and Yexian invaded Laiyang eastward via Jiukou. After being intercepted and blocked by the Chinese army from multiple directions, and after two days and nights of fierce fighting, Laiyang City was recaptured on the 12th. A portion of the remaining Japanese troops fled south, but were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy casualties. (Dispatch of the 15th)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Army Commander States That the Blockade of the Concessions Will Continue Intermittently Until All Pending Issues Are Resolved; Meat Is Exceptionally Scarce Within the British and French Concessions</h3>
<p>Tianjin: General Honma, the commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, stated to foreign journalists this morning that the Tianjin concessions will continue to be blockaded until all pending issues are satisfactorily resolved. When the Anglo-Japanese negotiations were progressing smoothly three months ago, the blockade could have ended, but the United States' abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan hardened Britain's attitude. When a reporter asked whether the Japanese military authorities would abide by the results of the diplomatic talks in Tokyo, Honma replied with a smile that soldiers must obey orders. He also said that he was very sorry that people of countries other than Britain were suffering as a result of the blockade and that he would try to reduce their inconvenience. The reporter drew his attention to the extreme shortage and high price of food and coal (homes, hotels, public places, and schools in Tianjin are now not burning coal for heating). Honma replied that the British and Japanese consular authorities were currently discussing the matter and that he expected a satisfactory solution. The reporter then asked why coal-carrying cars and ships had to unload coal and sift it at the blockade entrance, and told him that this was too time-consuming and increased costs. Honma replied that this was necessary for checking for weapons. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>Beiping: According to reports received here by Chinese people, meat is now extremely scarce in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Pork is selling for two yuan per catty, and mutton for one yuan and sixty cents, with prices so high and supplies still lacking. Getting meat is difficult, but within Chinese territory, pork is only selling for seventy cents and mutton for sixty cents. According to foreign sources, the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin has been tightened in the past few days, making it very inconvenient for people and goods to enter and exit, hence the high prices.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The War Aims of the European Belligerents</h3>
<p>The European war has been going on for almost three months now. Given modern military technology and transportation capabilities, these three months should have been long enough to pass the stage of preparation, deployment, and troop mobilization, and enter a state of intense fighting. But in fact, the Western Front has not been tense for a single day. Recently, even the sound of artillery has subsided. If one were to say that the war is in the air or at sea: however, the air forces of both sides mostly engage in reconnaissance and surveillance, without any fierce battles occurring. As for the news of the activities of warships or submarines, although reports continue incessantly, given the enormous naval power of Great Britain and Germany's confidence in its submarines, how much of a threat have the two sides posed to each other? In short, it is a fact that the war is not tense. Not only is the war not tense, but recently both sides have suddenly raised the issue of war aims. On the German side, the Nazi Party's newspaper published six war aims, most of which are empty and boundless, and after Poland has already been destroyed, it suddenly said that it wants to restore a puppet Poland. On the British side, Parliament is scheduled to adjourn on the 22nd of this month and reconvene on the 28th, at which time it plans to spend three days discussing the war aims of this war in a leisurely manner. Such an issue should have been thoroughly examined and addressed at the very beginning of the war, so why discuss it at this moment? Does that mean that everything in the past has been an action without a goal?</p>
<p>The problem is certainly not that simple. Germany originally had a goal when it launched the war, and that goal was to seize Poland. Now that Poland has been obtained, and even the issue of a possible German-Soviet conflict that could have arisen has been eliminated, then other than hoping for a truce, it has no goal. Germany is willing to make peace, but Great Britain and France, bound by their obligations, are unwilling to stop, so Germany has to bite the bullet and continue fighting. But fighting in this way, Germany is already in a passive position. A passive war has no direction externally, and it is not enough to rally support internally, so it has to find a new goal outside of the old goal, in order to turn passivity into activity and turn being on the defensive into taking the initiative. A week ago, the border between the Netherlands and Belgium had reached a point of extreme tension, but recently it has suddenly relaxed, which may be precisely because Germany cannot rashly launch the second phase of the war before its goal is determined.</p>
<p>On the British and French side, didn't they raise the grand banner of anti-aggression at the beginning of the war? This is a very just goal, so why is there a need for further discussion at the moment? Why is it necessary to bother the members of Parliament to ask the government authorities to explain? So clearly, this is not a question of whether or not there is a war aim, but a question of having to re-evaluate that war aim. The anti-aggression goal of Great Britain and France is indeed just, but it is not clear enough, and their attitude over the past two months has not been active enough, perhaps precisely because of this. So now is the time to re-evaluate. Originally, Great Britain did not take advantage of the absolute superiority of the democratic front to lead the world's forces for peace and strike at the fascist front, and it cannot shirk the responsibility for its procrastination and mistakes; now that it has joined the war but cannot quickly achieve results and resolve the crisis in Poland, one cannot help but doubt that its attitude towards anti-aggression is not firm enough. Furthermore, such as the recent withdrawal of British troops stationed in North China, although it has its stated reasons, it ultimately cannot escape the suspicion of compromise. So the attitude of the British authorities has already made people feel very confused; not only are people in other countries confused, but even the people of its own country cannot help but be confused. Members of Parliament are asking the government to explain the war aims, perhaps because of such motivation.</p>
<p>A confused mentality will inevitably have a significant impact on the war, so it is indeed a serious issue for the belligerents. China's War of Resistance has already given the world a correct indication. The goal of resisting aggression, combined with the government's firm and unchanging actions, makes all the people of the country hold the belief that final victory is inevitable, and this is the key to defeating the enemy. Although the second phase of the European war has not yet broken out, there will always be a day when it breaks out, and once it breaks out, the belligerents must pursue victory and not allow themselves to hesitate. As for whose victory the first phase was, it is certainly not yet time to judge, but the second phase will certainly be an extremely important battle that can lay the foundation for the success or failure of the overall situation. The conditions for victory, of course, are related to military and economic factors, but especially important is the spirit, and whether the spirit is strong or not is extremely dependent on the war aims, so the re-examination of the war aims is an important key in the future war situation.</p>
<p>Currently, it is certainly difficult for Germany to find a war aim that is sufficient to rally support; but if the goals of Great Britain and France are not clear enough and not enough to rally support, they will also not be able to have the confidence to win. Great Britain and France did not previously lack goals, and the goals were not unjust, but their attitude was not active enough, so it made people confused; the current problem lies in correcting the wavering attitude of the past, further uniting all anti-aggression forces in the world, and advancing towards the original goal. In this way, the European war will be transformed into a true anti-aggression war, and with the support of many and with the advantage of the material strength of Great Britain and France, it will not be difficult to find a true world peace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Public Opinion Advocates Improving Relations with the United States; US Under Secretary of State Refutes Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese public sentiment's call for a gradual offensive against third countries in China is increasing, especially focusing on the United States. All newspapers have reversed their attitude of the past two weeks. Those who previously conducted anti-American propaganda are now publishing articles opposing the rising prices of iron, herbs, etc. Well-known Japanese intellectuals have greatly changed their views. Since newspapers published the news that Prince Saionji will summon Prime Minister Abe, various circles have directly expressed their opinions on the current situation to the press or government officials. Count Kabayama Aisuke, a member of the House of Peers and president of the International Cultural Relations Association, visited Prime Minister Abe yesterday to contribute his views. Kabayama made many suggestions on the issue of improving Japan-US relations, believing that the actions of the Japanese army in China should not harm the rights of third countries. Kabayama urged Abe to avoid such actions, lest they cause another incident like the US abrogation of the Japan-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Kabayama also said that if Japan can resolve the issue of American interests in China one by one, the Sino-Japanese War can also be ended sooner. According to Japanese newspapers, Count Kabayama will visit the United States next year, where he will meet with President Roosevelt "to exchange views" and strive to promote Japan-US cultural relations.

<p>Washington: A Japanese spokesman in Shanghai recently made a statement saying that the US government is ready to recognize the new situation in China. Under Secretary of State Welles recently issued a statement to the press refuting this interpretation, saying that for a year, the US government has sent three notes to the Japanese government, the contents of which have been published and cannot be interpreted in this way. US Ambassador to Japan Grew has also not issued any statement in Tokyo that differs from the contents of the notes. (Havas dispatch of the 17th)</p>

<p>London: The Manchester Guardian said in an editorial today that since the outbreak of war in China, Britain's attitude on fundamental issues has never been in any doubt, and there is no possibility of Britain changing this attitude. As for the steps taken to withdraw British gunboats from the Yangtze River and British troops from North China, the reasons for this have been explained by the government and are due to the urgency of the war and are not related to Britain's overall policy. The British government's position on the Tianjin Chinese silver deposits and the Chinese legal tender remains firm and unchanged. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Turkish Relations; Turkey Maintains a Stable Force in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Moscow: Turkish sources here recently stated that although Soviet-Turkish relations remain friendly as before, Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu's visit here in September to conduct negotiations with the Soviet authorities failed to reach an understanding, so that the general situation between the two countries has not made any progress. At this moment, because Turkey is obligated to Great Britain and France, it has no choice but to reject the Soviet Union's request to blockade the Dardanelles Strait. At the same time, the Soviet Union is still unwilling to assist Turkey in resisting the invasion of the Balkan countries by Germany. These two points are the reason why the Turkish-Soviet agreement could not be concluded. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, after the Finnish issue is resolved, it may be possible to change its attitude. However, Turkey must still maintain a stable force in the Balkans, which is a zone of conflict between the interests of the Soviet Union, the other Balkan countries, and Italy. In addition, foreign observers here have not been able to confirm rumors that Bulgaria intends to negotiate a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union to jointly deal with Turkey, but they are paying great attention to the evolution of relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.

<h3>The Soviet Union Presents Three Demands to Finland; Roosevelt Explains Negotiations Regarding Finland's Loan from the United States</h3>
<p>Moscow - Soviet newspapers yesterday continued their anti-Finnish campaign, announcing the demands recently made by the Soviet government during negotiations with Finland. These can be divided into the following three points: (1) The Soviet-Finnish border in Karelia should be pushed north, giving the Soviet Union a naval base, and at the same time preventing Finnish land forces outside the border from attacking Leningrad with artillery fire. (2) The Soviet Union intends to establish submarine bases on two peninsulas bordering Finland, but Finland itself is unable to defend these peninsulas, nor can it fortify them. (3) The Soviet line of defense should be bounded by the Gulf of Finland, including not only Hanko Island but also the seven small islands near the Soviet naval port, as the Soviet Union is determined not to allow Leningrad to be threatened by land, sea, and air. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park City, USA - Soviet newspapers published news that the Finnish government's tough stance in negotiations with the Soviet Union was due to the United States government's promise of economic and financial assistance. President Roosevelt stated to the press here that he denied ever making such a promise, only saying that the Finnish government had indeed requested a loan in the United States a few months ago to build a railway, and the United States government immediately asked them to contact private banks in New York directly. It is not surprising that Finland negotiated loans with American banks, as this "is within the country's rights." (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>British Pound Falls in New York Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>New York - The New York foreign exchange market saw the British pound fall to its lowest level this year due to rumors that the authorities would allow the pound to fall to $3.75 or even $3.50 by the end of the year. The opening price was $3.89875, and the closing price was $3.90125. The one-month forward discount was 2.5, and the three-month forward discount was 6.25. The foreign exchange market is paying close attention to the closer economic union between Britain and France. According to some observers, this move will weaken the pound further, or that the decline in forward exchange rates is due to speculators switching to forwards because current rates are difficult to manipulate. Selling current rates to buy forwards can be profitable at current market prices, but few banks are willing to do so. At the same time, according to private sources in London, neutral countries have very little money left in London, and it may be exhausted in a few weeks. The pounds obtained from selling goods to Britain are also scarce because Britain now pays extra for imports compared to before the war, or obtains relief from British investors selling American securities. The value of the Canadian dollar also fell, closing today at $4.46125, due to news that Canada is purchasing large amounts of military supplies in the United States. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Close Economic Ties Between Britain and France; Establishing a Strong War Machine; Setting Up a Standing Executive Committee to Handle Important Decisions of the Supreme Defense Council</h3>
<p>London - The Anglo-French Supreme Military Council held its third meeting in London since the start of the war today, reviewing the general military situation and its possible future developments. Among the matters discussed were methods of jointly utilizing the British and French forces to achieve maximum effectiveness, and avoiding competition in overseas procurement of military supplies. All resolutions were handed over to the Anglo-French Adjustment Committee, which will be established immediately, for implementation. The French side attending the meeting included Prime Minister Daladier, Allied Commander-in-Chief Gamelin, Naval Commander-in-Chief Darlan, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Vuillemin. The British side included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Minister for Coordination of Defense Chatfield, and Air Minister Wood. The French representatives arrived in Britain by plane and met with the British representatives at a designated location within an hour of their arrival. Few people knew about it, but when they left the meeting, a small number of onlookers outside cheered the British and French dignitaries. British Prime Minister Chamberlain left his home after being ill for the first time. He walked with a cane when he got into the car.</p>
<p>Press Release</p>
<p>After the meeting, the British and French leaders issued a joint communiqué stating that, in order to actively utilize the experience gained from 1914 to 1918, the British and French governments decided from the beginning of the war to adjust the economic war efforts of the two countries to the greatest possible extent. Therefore, as soon as the war started, both sides immediately took steps to achieve this goal. The arrangements previously implemented by the two governments have now been further strengthened and completed in accordance with the resolutions established by Chamberlain and Daladier at the last meeting of the Supreme Military Council. Common actions have been taken in all aspects of the sky, munitions, raw materials, oil, food, shipping, and economic warfare. The new plan adopted by the two governments will stipulate the best use of raw materials, production methods, and ship tonnage for the common benefit, and will also stipulate the equal distribution of any restricted goods in the event of circumstances requiring a reduction in the import process. The two countries will jointly prepare import procedures in the future and avoid competition in overseas procurement during the implementation of these procedures. All of this implementation work has been handed over to the Anglo-French Permanent Executive Committee for handling, and this Executive Committee will be subordinate to the Anglo-French Adjustment Committee, which will be organized immediately. If necessary, these methods can be extended to other areas, and the determination of Britain and France to unify and cooperate their war efforts to the greatest possible extent can be further demonstrated. All arrangements for organizing the joint action of the two countries, which were only realized in the final struggle of the third year of the last war, have now been implemented in this way within two months of the start of the war. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>British and French Newspapers Unanimously Praise</h3>
<p>London - The decisions made by the Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference have been commented on by various newspapers, which say that the two allied countries of Britain and France can therefore be confident of victory, and that the economic institutions of all countries in the world during and after the war will also be positively influenced by this. An editorial in "The Times" said that Britain and France took nearly four years to establish a united relationship during the last European war. This time, the war has lasted less than three months, and the belligerent parties have not yet directly clashed, but Britain and France have already achieved such results, which is something to celebrate. The two countries have now established a comprehensive alliance relationship, and the unpleasant feelings caused by one party wanting to protect its currency and restrict the other party's imports can also be easily removed. In short, the economic, military, and diplomatic cooperation between Britain and France has achieved results. Not only can they be confident of victory, but also the economic prosperity and orderly progress after the war will be easier to achieve. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London - "Le Petit Parisien" said today that the economic cooperation method established by the Anglo-French Supreme Military Council is an unprecedented agreement in history, which can reduce the war expenses of the two countries. The famous reporter Bertina published an article in "L'Ordre," pointing out that this agreement between Britain and France can serve as a precedent for future European or global cooperation after the war.

<h3>Chamberlain Attends Meeting While Ill</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - It has been learned here that British Prime Minister Chamberlain attended the Anglo-French Allied Supreme Defense Council held in London yesterday for the first time after being ill. One of his feet was still swollen and he could not wear shoes. He was wearing a slipper, walking unsteadily with a cane. After the meeting, Chamberlain hosted a banquet for the delegates at the Carlton Hotel. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<h3>Western Front: Germany Waits for Opportunity to Attack; Hitler Willing to Take a Gamble; Differences in Opinion with the Conservative Faction</h3>
<p>London - Well-informed sources here recently said that, according to news from various neutral countries, German leader Hitler has decided to concentrate his forces to attack the French Maginot Line as a last resort. The scale of the attack will be unprecedented, and therefore the future of the entire Europe will depend on this. Although Hitler said in a recent speech in Munich that he had instructed Air Force Minister General Goering to prepare for five years of war, he still believed that the only way for the country to win was through a "swift victory." Military leaders generally consider large-scale offensives to be too risky, saying that regardless of success or failure, the number of casualties among officers and soldiers will be high. This major loss alone is enough to demoralize the military. If the attack fails, the entire national defense mechanism that the country has painstakingly built up over the years will be destroyed in one fell swoop. Therefore, although they have not openly opposed it, they have tried their best to dissuade him. However, Hitler himself has not abandoned this plan, saying that if the current war is prolonged for more than a year, the "iron clamp strategy" adopted by Britain and France will be enough to subdue Germany. Rather than waiting to die and allowing Germany to be defeated by the Allied forces, it is better to preemptively strike while the British Expeditionary Force has not yet been deployed in large numbers to the mainland, and the main force on the Western Front is only the French army, in order to win the war in one battle. Hitler's argument is thus, and his views are clearly very different from those of the conservative faction in the military. It is not difficult to imagine that the two sides are arguing fiercely. In short, Hitler intends to concentrate the country's infantry, artillery, mechanized units, and air force in one corner of the Western Front to attack the Maginot Line, similar to the Battle of Verdun in the last European war, until the enemy forces are unable to resist. At the same time, during the offensive, he will send a small number of aircraft to bomb Britain in an attempt to shake morale, and send a large number of submarines to attack the British fleet in order to achieve surprising results in naval warfare to boost morale. Commentators here say that this plan is brave but has little hope of success, because with the strength of the British and French Allied forces, no matter what offensive Germany takes, it will not be difficult to give them a head-on blow. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris - "Le Petit Parisien" today published an essay by military reporter Maurice, saying that "to attack or not to attack is the question that keeps Hitler awake at night. It seems that the instructions given by Hitler to the general staff are 'prepare and wait.'" It is speculated that there are many reasons why the German side is not active, namely, internal worries have not subsided, military officers have conflicting opinions, the climate is not suitable, and military preparations have not matured. All these reasons are possible. One can also say that Hitler is now waiting for a miracle to happen, but in wartime, miracles only appear when armies are fighting, as in the Battle of the Marne in the last Great War. We cannot but be grateful for the current inactive situation, because it allows our preparations to be completed. Next spring, our strength will be unmatched. In order to prevent the German attack, the strong French army guarding the front line between the Rhine and the Moselle Rivers sends scouts and reconnaissance teams to spy on enemy positions several times every twenty-four hours. Yesterday, this team encountered a small enemy team, so there were frequent contacts east of the Moselle River, but there were no important developments. German patrols had to retreat under French artillery fire. We are now prepared to spend the winter in inactivity. If war tactics require us to defend the trenches for three years to subdue the enemy, then we would rather do this than make any unnecessary sacrifices of French people. This is also the prospect of the soldiers on the front line." (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Air Raid Alarms Frequently Sounded in British and French Cities; German Aircraft Drop Leaflets and Cotton Bombs - Another Form of Psychological Warfare</h3>
<p>Paris - According to news obtained by reporters today, German aircraft that raided northern and eastern France this week often dropped leaflets, and yesterday they dropped cotton bombs. German aircraft flew very high to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and they dropped several tons of cotton bombs. Blown by the wind, they landed on a very large area of ground. After the French recovered these cotton bombs, they conducted chemical tests, but did not find any chemicals inside. According to general observation, the German dropping of cotton bombs is another form of Hitler's psychological warfare. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation recently released news that an air raid alarm was issued in the northwest of the country this morning. Several enemy aircraft appeared in the sky near Manchester without dropping bombs. Local anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and several fighters also took off and drove the enemy aircraft away. In addition, air raid alarms were issued in thirteen cities in England and Scotland, and in the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland this morning. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris - An air raid alarm was issued in southern France today from 9:30 AM to 11:10 AM. In Marseille, an alarm was issued from 11:35 AM and lifted at 12:25 PM. At 2:15 PM, the area issued a second alarm, and the sound of anti-aircraft artillery could be heard in the distance. A German aircraft flew over the Annecy area of Haute-Savoie during the day. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris - Air raid alarms were issued today in the western city of Poitiers, the central cities of Clermont-Ferrand and Châteauroux, the northern city of Dunkirk, and the eastern cities of Annecy and Annemasse. Anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, but the enemy aircraft did not drop bombs. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>Aircraft of Belligerent Countries Violate Neutrality; Belgian Newspaper Publishes Article Acknowledging Inability to Prevent It</h3>
<p>Beijing - A German aircraft flew over the city of Ghent in Belgium this morning. Anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and the German aircraft flew away. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Bern - A communiqué released here said that foreign aircraft were found dropping anti-British French leaflets in several parts of Swiss airspace. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Beijing - There were rumors that the Belgian government was allowing foreign military aircraft to fly over the country without interception. The semi-official Belgian news agency published a statement today denying this, saying: "It is true that aircraft from various belligerent countries have frequently flown over our national airspace in recent days, but it is also true that our anti-aircraft artillery and fighter aircraft have immediately dispatched to intercept them whenever possible. Moreover, according to our national authorities, even the major belligerent countries themselves cannot prevent enemy aircraft from attacking their hinterland one by one. Therefore, it is even more difficult for Belgium to prevent foreign military aircraft from flying over its airspace. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Shipbuilding Industry Active; 150 Merchant Ships Under Construction; Germany Lacks Both Raw Materials and Labor</h3>
<p>London - The British shipbuilding industry is currently very active, and all shipyards are operating at full capacity. The Admiralty has indeed ordered a lot of ships, but this does not account for the majority of the shipbuilding industry's activity. It is estimated that there are currently more than 150 ships under construction in Britain. Whenever a new ship is launched and space is freed up, the keel of another new ship is immediately laid, and work does not stop. Recent German broadcasts have claimed that Germany has replaced Britain as the world's largest shipbuilding country and the most important supplier of ships. Observers here scoff at this, saying that the only possible basis for this German exaggeration is that Germany is selling its useless merchant ships that are currently berthed in neutral ports. Germany may be the largest supplier of ships in this short period of time, because many German ships berthed in neutral ports are not only useless, but also increase Germany's troubles in paying mooring fees, etc., due to the shortage of foreign currency. It is better to sell them. As for the German shipbuilding industry, it is well known that the German shipbuilding industry is facing great difficulties due to the lack of both labor and raw materials, and the German navy urgently needs to build submarines to compensate for losses. At the same time, neutral shipping companies are unwilling to order new ships from Germany due to the attacks on neutral ships by German submarines. The uncertainty of the delivery time, the lack of attention to materials and labor, and the possible dangers at the time of delivery also make neutral countries afraid to order ships from Germany.

<h3>15 Finnish Merchant Ships Intercepted by German Warships; Request for Release Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Helsinki - It has been learned that at least 15 Finnish ships have been intercepted by German warships, ordered to sail to German ports, and detained. The goods carried by these ships were all transported to neutral countries, especially to the United States. They were intercepted by German warships when sailing to the Falsterbo Strait south of Sweden. The Finnish government has repeatedly made representations to the German government to request release, but to no effect. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>French Next Year's Fiscal Budget Submitted to the Finance Committees of Both Houses</h3>

<h3>Population Exchange and Withdrawal of Residents from Soviet and German Occupied Zones Has Been Agreed to by Both Parties</h3>
<p>Moscow - It has been heard that the German and Soviet authorities have reached an agreement on the withdrawal of German residents from the Polish territory occupied by the Soviet Union, and the return of Soviet and Ukrainian residents from German territory to Soviet territory. Therefore, there are about 1 million Soviet people and about 115,000 German people who will be relocated, but this is a voluntary relocation and not forced. It is heard that the first batch of 500 German households have left the Limburg area of southern Poland. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>The German Social Party Suppresses and the Czechs Riot: Anti-German Demonstrations Held in Prague; Universities Closed and Students Arrested</h3>
<p>Capital of Switzerland. According to informed sources here, the events that have recently occurred in Prague, Bohemia Province, are of an "extremely serious nature" and are indicative of the unrest in the area. This was also acknowledged by the German semi-official news agency, the German News Agency, which reported that a large number of Czechs in Bohemia and Moravia had been executed by German authorities, and a large number had been arrested. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Danzig. Yesterday, hundreds of people demonstrated and marched in the center of Prague, resulting in serious disturbances. Nine Czechs have been shot and killed and a large number arrested. When the police intervened in the demonstration, many people were seriously injured. According to the German official news agency, the Czechs attempted to disrupt public order in the Protectorate (Bohemia and Moravia) with "various resistance activities of different scales," resulting in executions and arrests. Some Czech intellectuals and those close to Beneš (the last Czech president) have been trying to disrupt public order for some time. Several incidents have occurred in universities, and these schools have now been ordered to close for three years. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. According to news from Prague, the tribal president of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Hácha, refused to sign an order to mobilize one million Czechs to serve in the German army, which angered the Protectorate's governor, Neurath, who immediately placed him under house arrest in Lány Castle. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>New York. The oppressive measures taken by Germany in Bohemia and Moravia have aroused indignation in American public opinion. The Democratic New York Times reported, "The residents of Prague are spending another night in terror." The Republican New York Herald Tribune reported, "Hitler shamelessly claims that the goal of this war is to free Europe from the shackles of Britain. The absurdity of this statement is clearly demonstrated by the events that took place in Prague yesterday." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Prague. Nine students in the Bohemia-Moravia Protectorate were arrested for leading anti-German demonstrations, sentenced by a military court, and executed by firing squad. The military court also issued a decree ordering the closure of all universities. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>The Hague. News recently received from the Austrian border states that the German authorities in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia have taken various measures to completely assimilate the Czechs and Germans, and use anti-Semitic laws to send German personnel to supervise businesses run by Czechs. All Czech workers in major arms factories are also being replaced by German workers as much as possible. On the other hand, after the Germans from the Baltic Sea countries withdrew to their homeland, a portion of them were settled by the German authorities in areas inhabited by Czechs. The families of German military officers stationed in the country have also been ordered to go to Bohemia and Moravia. Many schools run by Czechs have been ordered to close by the German authorities, and the school buildings have been requisitioned for military use. In the schools that are still open, German is a required subject. However, the Czechs are strongly resisting Germanization, and demonstrations are seen almost daily. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris. It is heard that thousands of leaflets were distributed in Prague today, stating that the Munich bombing was carried out by the German secret police to incite hatred of Britain among the German people. It is also heard that the leaflets contained speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain, French Premier Daladier, and former Czech President Beneš. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris. According to sources in France, Czech Protectorate President Hácha is now effectively confined to Lány Palace for administrative reasons. It is believed that Berlin asked President Hácha to sign an order mobilizing one million Czechs to be incorporated into the German army in a ratio of three Germans to one Czech. However, Hácha refused to sign it, so the Germans placed Hácha under house arrest. According to news from the Austrian border, six thousand Czechs were arrested the day after the Munich bombing, and six hundred of them have been sent to concentration camps. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London. Former Czech President Beneš gave a speech in London today on the terror in the Czech Republic, saying that as Germany's situation becomes more difficult, its methods of terror become more cruel. However, the Czechs will never cease their resistance. The shooting of Czech students is reminiscent of the situation in Belgium during the last World War. This crime will have a great impact on Czech public opinion. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Capital of the Netherlands. The 28th of last month was the national day of Czechoslovakia. Czechs held demonstrations in Prague and clashed with German political police, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The "People's Daily" here has recently published a lengthy dispatch describing the events, stating that "the clash between demonstrators and political police resulted in many deaths and injuries, and several policemen were thrown into the river by the crowd, causing a political uproar. Hundreds of Czechs have been arrested as a result. Himmler, the director of the German political police, immediately went to Prague to inspect the situation. He was deeply dissatisfied with the way the local political police, the stormtroopers of the Social Party, and the security forces handled the incident. In his opinion, the political police and stormtroopers did not need to open fire at the time. It would be in Germany's interest to make the outside world believe that the Protectorate is peaceful and quiet. On the contrary, if the Protectorate experiences turmoil, it will cause a bad impression abroad. After Himmler returned from his inspection, Neurath, the highest official of the Protectorate, immediately met with Czech President Hácha and informed him that the German authorities had decided not to pursue the demonstrators and that all others arrested in the case would also be released. However, the Czechs must express their 'loyalty' to Germany within a short period of time in order to eliminate the negative impression caused by the incident. Neurath even proposed several measures to President Hácha: (1) revise the current borders of Bohemia and Moravia to benefit the Czechs; (2) change the legal status of the provinces, in other words, change the Protectorate into a republic subordinate to Germany; (3) the government of this republic should issue a declaration of loyalty to Germany, thereby formally declaring war on Britain and France (even a symbolic declaration of war would be acceptable), and at the same time, Czech troops should be trained and placed under German command. All of this has been rejected by President Hácha. The German authorities then claimed that President Hácha was 'overworked' and 'advised' him to return to his villa in Lány Castle to rest fully, while taking the necessary measures to prevent him from being disturbed by the outside world (i.e., placing him under house arrest). The above is the current situation in Bohemia and Moravia. How it will evolve in the future is difficult to predict. If Germany were to abolish the Protectorate and directly incorporate the provinces into its territory, it would inevitably cause a bad impression abroad, and it seems unwilling to do so for the time being. However, it is generally believed that President Hácha and his government will be replaced by puppets selected by Berlin." (Havas)</p>

<h3>Foreign Military Advisors Suggest Limited Destruction of Highways; Chinese Army's General Counteroffensive Requires Heavy Weapons and Highways Will Be Used for Necessary Transportation</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. Foreign military advisors in Chongqing have suggested to the Chongqing military authorities that China's passive defense strategy of completely destroying all transportation in various war zones to prevent further Japanese advances will be an obstacle to China's long-prepared general counteroffensive. This action, which concerns the Chinese army's strategic methods, can render the Japanese army's current superior tanks, heavy artillery, and light artillery ineffective, and was a key factor in China's recent repulse of the Japanese invasion in northern Hunan. The Japanese army's disastrous defeat in northern Hubei in April of this year was also mainly due to the Chinese army's destruction of transportation. In addition, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi and central Shanxi also used the same method to thwart the Japanese army's nine "mopping-up" operations, preparing to cross the Yellow River and invade Shaanxi. When the Japanese army fought in the plains of eastern and central China, the Japanese tanks, armored vehicles, cavalry, and artillery roamed freely on excellent highways. When the Japanese army attacked Xuzhou, the Japanese "rapid forces" cut off the Chinese army's divisions, cut off their retreat, and encircled the Chinese army's strong positions. When the Japanese army was unable to advance due to the Yellow River breach, the Japanese army used the Yangtze River as an easy route to attack Hankou.</p>
<p>The situation is no longer the same today. One year after the fall of Hankou, the Chinese army has implemented a systematic plan to destroy highways, focusing on defense methods in mountainous areas. As a result, the Japanese army cannot use heavy weapons, putting them on an equal footing with the Chinese army, forming the current stalemate. When the reporter recently inspected the front line in Changsha, he saw that the ancient roads built by China over the ages were completely destroyed. The highways that previously carried trucks are now planted with rice. Where highways cannot be destroyed, the Chinese army has dug large holes, 30 to 40 feet deep, some of which are filled with two or three feet of water. Next to them are high mountains or rice paddies, which can prevent vehicles from advancing on either side of the highway. All of these measures are being implemented in mountainous areas. The only transportation line in these areas is a small road only two feet wide. The Chinese army is carrying out the same defense plan in areas from Changsha to Hengyang. According to Chinese military experts, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha, they could not transport mountain guns, tanks, or heavy artillery across the Xinqiang River. Artillery and tanks cannot travel on small roads. The Japanese army cannot use other roads to advance. As a result, the Chinese army, armed with machine guns, rifles, and some mountain guns, fought the Japanese army, who were armed similarly. The Chinese divisions, who were experienced in mobile warfare, were able to concentrate in relevant positions according to strategy, even with Japanese aircraft reconnaissance in the air. Sometimes, to avoid Japanese aerial reconnaissance, the Chinese army could move 50 miles in one night. These lightly armed Chinese soldiers can fight for several days without relying on anything other than rice. They all wear straw sandals and can climb mountains as if walking on flat ground, which is much faster than the Japanese army wearing leather boots. Therefore, they were able to quickly execute the Chinese army headquarters' operational orders and defeat the Japanese army in one fell swoop. On the contrary, the Japanese army was unfamiliar with the mountainous terrain, lost their way, and were attacked by the Chinese army from all sides, forcing them to make a "strategic retreat." Chinese military authorities have said that the Chinese army can rely</p>
<p>greatly on manpower to transport munitions and food to the front lines to meet the needs of the Chinese army. At the same time, foreign advisors told reporters that the Chinese army on the front lines in northern Hunan has never felt a shortage of ammunition. Thousands of laborers carry munitions and food to the front lines on their shoulders or in old handcarts. This situation will not lead to a shortage of munitions on the front lines unless foreign supplies are cut off or domestic munitions are depleted. However, when the Chinese army launches a counteroffensive in the future, if it wants to recapture Hankou, it must tactically use heavy artillery, tanks, light artillery, and thousands of tons of munitions. Therefore, while destroying transportation for defense is ideal, it will reduce the strength of the counteroffensive when the Chinese army</p>
<p>launches a major counteroffensive. Chinese sources have said that China's great manpower can transport all the munitions needed by the Chinese army to the front lines for use in a major counteroffensive in the future. The Chinese can also rebuild major highways to facilitate the movement of heavy trucks and the transportation of heavy artillery. However, in the view of foreign advisors, this project will take several years to complete. A French advisor said that if the destruction of highways does not exceed the limit, it can be quite appropriate for defense. He said, "The Chinese army does not yet have a definite date for a large-scale counteroffensive. The Chinese army will continue to wage defensive warfare, but hopes that the international situation will change before deciding on the definite date for its major counteroffensive."

<h3>Japanese Army Retreats Near Jiuling</h3>

<h3>Xinhua Daily Warns the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party, today urged the United States to take strong measures against Japan, stating that since the United States has adopted a neutral stance toward the European war, there is no need to concentrate its fleet in the Atlantic. Therefore, its position in the Pacific has become much stronger. The newspaper urged the US government and capitalists not to forget the importance of the United States' position in the Far East and not to allow Japan to establish hegemony in the Far East. It also said that although the United States can profit greatly by supplying munitions to European countries, the United States should not forget the consequences of the last World War. Therefore, for the sake of the United States, it should focus entirely on the Pacific, because only in this region does the United States have unlimited trade and investment opportunities. The newspaper continued that the United States can be tough on Japan without any hesitation. Japanese newspapers regard the United States' actions, such as naval activities and expansion, and Pittman's proposals for sanctions against Japan, as an aggressive attitude towards Japan and criticize them. However, Japanese politicians are constantly flattering the United States in order to win its friendship. This shows that the United States is in a pivotal position in the Far East. Finally, the newspaper regarded the actions of Britain and France in withdrawing their troops stationed in North China as concessions to Japan. (United Press, 16th)</p>

<h3>Siamese Government Strictly Discriminating Against Chinese, Thousands of Overseas Chinese Arrested, All Schools Closed, Overseas Chinese Forced to Speak Siamese</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. The Siamese government is taking very active measures to discriminate against Chinese. It is estimated that over 100 people have been deported in the past month alone, including Wu Biyan, the president of the Bangkok National Daily and executive member of the Kuomintang's general branch in Thailand, and Liang Weicheng, a local celebrity. Recently, each Siamese ship arriving in Hong Kong has been carrying an average of 30 to 40 people. The Meixi Meilun, which arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, also carried over 30 overseas Chinese who had been deported, mostly from Chaozhou, and mostly teachers from overseas Chinese schools and those in charge of overseas Chinese organizations. According to them, the Siamese government has recently arrested thousands of overseas Chinese. Over a thousand were arrested in October, and the reasons are still unknown. They include presidents of social organizations, businessmen, teachers, and shop clerks. All Chinese newspapers in Thailand have been closed, and only one Chinese newspaper remains. The overseas Chinese community is extremely uneasy, and the business community is suffering great fluctuations and huge commercial losses. There are over 100 Chinese primary and secondary schools in Thailand, most of which have now been closed by the Siamese government. Only two or three small schools of no significance remain. The Siamese government not only closes schools but also forces Chinese children to wear Siamese clothes, speak Siamese, and attend Siamese schools to learn Siamese. It is estimated that about 230,000 overseas Chinese students in Thailand have lost their schooling, and some have already returned to Kunming to request government accommodation. Most of the overseas Chinese who have been discriminated against are those who donated money to return to their country and were arrested.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants in the Yangtze River Trade Subjected to Exclusion</h3>
<p>Former Trading Ports Now Ruins</p>
<p>Correspondent's dispatch from a certain area of the Yangtze River basin for the English-language "Great American Evening Post" states: The number of foreigners here is roughly the same as before the Sino-Japanese War. The foreign commercial district of the past is now mostly a pile of rubble. From the phenomena observed, the Japanese are currently excluding foreign commerce. Foreign merchants cannot operate not because of the conditions here, but because the Japanese do not want foreign merchants here. Some parts of the city have returned to normal, but other parts are still</p>
<p>in ruins</p>
<p>Many shops have been slightly repaired and reopened. Although there are enough goods in stock, the prices are so high that most people cannot afford them. Apples now sell for 60 cents a pound, and less than two catties of kerosene cost one yuan. Poor business is inevitable. Sidewalks have been paved on both sides of the main street. The work is shoddy, but homeowners facing the main street have been ordered to pay street paving fees, which are very high. Although homeowners can pave better roads at a lower cost, they are not allowed to do so themselves. The Japanese monopoly of import and export is a major obstacle to commercial recovery. For example, if a shop wants to obtain goods from Shanghai, it must obtain a permit. Goods brought here without a permit will be confiscated. This move greatly hinders the flow of goods. According to one merchant, the tax levied by this agency on foreign goods is several times higher than that levied on the same Japanese goods. It is difficult for Chinese businessmen to make a small profit, so the situation here</p>
<p>is still quite bleak</p>
<p>Rice, wheat, and other grains are also monopolized, bought from farmers at extremely low prices and sold to city dwellers at exorbitant prices. One example is that flour sells for more than seven yuan per bag. Fuel is very expensive, and coal is almost impossible to obtain. Electricity costs from 20 to 35 cents per kilowatt-hour. Street lighting is dim, and robberies occur frequently. When alarms sound, the police and others never come to help. The Japanese secretly control everything, and even schools and churches are monitored by Japanese puppets. Church sermons must also be reported to the military police in advance, including the time, location, and number of people. American and British expatriates are</p>
<p>quite indignant</p>
<p>at this interference with religious and freedom of speech. Japanese in plain clothes or semi-military uniforms often go to shops with armed Japanese soldiers and force shop owners to buy narcotics and other items. Their attitudes are fierce, and shop owners dare not refuse. Another group of Japanese often comes soon after to force sales or "borrow money". Those who are asked dare not refuse. Since the situation has been like this before, it is not surprising that there are very few people who are enthusiastic about the "New Order in East Asia."</p>
<h3>British Malaya Restricts Remittances and Imports</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. Since the rise in foreign exchange rates, remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to China have been very active. The average monthly remittances to Fujian province are in the range of six to seven hundred thousand yuan. In September of this year alone, the remittances received by private letter offices in Quanzhou reached more than five million yuan, of which more than 2.1 million yuan were from the Philippines, more than 1.1 million yuan from Singapore, more than 800,000 yuan from Penang, more than 500,000 yuan from Java, more than 120,000 yuan from Sumatra, more than 110,000 yuan from Celebes, more than 100,000 yuan from Annam, more than 80,000 yuan from Burma, more than 50,000 yuan from Siam, more than 30,000 yuan from Borneo, and more than 10,000 yuan from other territories. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have enthusiastically promoted the use of domestic goods. Due to the war, the sales of domestic agricultural and industrial products in the occupied areas have been completely cut off, and most of them are being transported to Southeast Asia for sale. Therefore, during this war of resistance, the economies of Southeast Asia and China are very closely linked. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the governments of British Malaya have strictly restricted remittances and imports, which has suddenly affected the support of overseas Chinese families in China, making their lives very difficult. The sales of domestic goods have also suddenly stagnated. According to investigations, there are more than 120 large-scale Chinese businesses in British Malayan cities engaged in the import of domestic goods. Most of their goods are produced by Shanghai and Hong Kong Chinese factories, among which silk, cosmetics, tobacco, alcohol, porcelain, electrical materials, and leather goods sell the best. After these restrictions, factories in Hong Kong and Shanghai have suffered major setbacks. The Chinese Consulate General in Singapore has lodged a protest with the government of the British Straits Settlements. The British government has now adopted a lenient approach to overseas Chinese remittances, allowing each overseas Chinese to remit a maximum of 500 Straits dollars per transaction (currently, 15.75 Straits dollars can be converted to 100 legal tender, and 54 Straits dollars can be converted to 100 Hong Kong dollars). Donations from overseas Chinese organizations and individuals to the motherland can be handled flexibly and are not subject to this restriction. The removal of import restrictions is still under negotiation.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Conference (4): Improving Military Training in Secondary Schools Using Physical Education</h3>
<p>(19) Resolved to adopt the proposal to request the Education Department to formulate a minimum standard of teaching materials based on the national secondary school curriculum outline and with reference to the suitability of various schools in northern Jiangsu, so that all schools can follow it. (20) Resolved that the proposing school should first design and experiment on how to implement various subjects in wartime schools to meet current needs, and submit the design details and experimental results to the department for review and circulation to other schools for reference. (21) Resolved to request the Education Department to issue the secondary school guidance outline to ensure uniformity, upon public decision. (22) Resolved that each school should consider implementing a rotating weekly system for class advisors in secondary schools to achieve unified moral education. (23) Regarding the junior high school entrance examination, to increase the number of students admitted with equivalent academic qualifications. (24) Resolved to discuss the above two proposals together, considering the special circumstances in northern Jiangsu, and to make appropriate adjustments to the number of students in each grade and the proportion of new students admitted with equivalent academic qualifications. The proportion of new students admitted with equivalent academic qualifications should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, but those who apply with equivalent academic qualifications must pass all subjects in order to be admitted. (25) Resolved to submit a request to the Ministry of Education to amend Article 62 of the revised secondary school regulations, stating that the principle for secondary school students is comprehensive development, and all subjects should be treated equally, without distinction between major and minor subjects, to avoid creating a negative impression on students. (26) Each school should formulate its own standards for student retention based on its organizational structure when examining academic performance. (27) Resolved that if a student's grades in the first semester of each academic year fail to meet the requirements of Article 62 of the secondary school regulations, it should be handled. (28) Resolved that students in the first grade who fail their grades should only be held back at the end of the academic year.

<h3>Li Yichen Scores a Hat-Trick, Lido Defeats Westports 3-1, Lineup Change Immediately Becomes Lively, Group A with Four Wins in Four Matches Leading the Pack</h3>
<p>In the Westports League Group A match, Lido leads the pack with four wins in four matches. As a result of yesterday's match, they defeated Westports 3-1. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. There were only 500 to 600 spectators at the Yiyuan Stadium, a bleak scene. This is because Westports has repeatedly lost matches in this season, and their strength is mediocre. Lido, on the other hand, had previously announced that their main players were absent and would be playing with a weakened team, and they were unwilling to announce their lineup. Indeed, Lido's main forwards Sun Jinshun and Huang Kehou were both absent, resulting in a lack of leadership, which led to Westports scoring first. Fortunately, Yan Shixin's penalty kick was missed by Westports, otherwise they would have been trailing 2-0. Lido quickly changed their lineup, and Jiang Chao was moved to left winger, and the front line immediately became lively. Veteran Li Yichen showed his skills and scored the first goal, tying the score in the first half. In the second half, he scored two more goals with powerful shots, a hat-trick, working very hard. Li's attack is better than his defense. If it weren't for Yichen, they would have been defeated yesterday. Westports is old and fading, and there is nothing good to report.</p>

<p>Equal in the First Half</p>
<p>Westports kicked off. After seven minutes, Lido attacked. Wu Qixiang received a pass from Xu Wenkui and shot diagonally from 15 yards, low and fast, but unfortunately it went just outside the post. Then, Xu Wenkui tapped the ball near the goal, hitting the left post and bouncing out, sounding like a cannonball. It was a pity that it was less than ten yards from the goal. After 26 minutes, Yan Shixin fought for the ball with the opponent's right winger on the baseline. After intercepting it, he didn't kick it far enough. McLone passed the ball in the middle, and Li Yichen was unable to retreat in time. He deflected the ball backwards, and as Lu Zhongen was about to catch up, Ukraine had already rushed in. Less than three yards from the goal, Shixin saw that the situation was critical and stepped forward to tackle, resulting in a penalty kick. McLone took the penalty kick, but it flew high over the goal. Lido was spared from danger. After 37 minutes, Ukraine's free kick hit Li Yichen's body and bounced out. Ukraine passed the ball to the front of the goal again, and McLone headed it in. Chui Jiuen was unable to save it, and Lido lost a goal. At this time, Li Yichen was transferred to center forward, and the attack became stronger. In less than a minute, Li went straight to the opponent's goal and tied the score. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw, with no winner yet.</p>
<p>Lido's Triumph</p>
<p>The second half started, and Lido's forwards, led by Li Yichen, launched a fierce attack on the opponent's camp. However, Westports' defense was strong, making it difficult to penetrate. Cao Qiuting was closely guarded, and Zhang Mingsheng had no chance to get the ball. The forwards repeatedly tried to break through the middle, but were unsuccessful. After 18 minutes, Wenkui passed the ball to Li Yichen, who swept the ball with his left foot from 20 yards. Walter missed the save, and the ball went straight into the left corner, a clear and beautiful shot. Lido took the lead. Before long, Jiang Zhaoxiang committed a foul. Pete took a free kick from 30 yards and shot remotely at the goal. The ball came with great force, and Zhongen knelt down and held it. Two minutes before the end of the game, Cao Qiuting crossed the ball, and Li Yichen scored his third goal, setting a hat-trick record. Westports was defeated by Lido 3-1.</p>

<h3>Food Grain Rice Prices Soar by Three to Four Yuan What Kind of Situation Is This… Nothing More Than Speculation Allegedly to Reward Rice Vendors… Skillful at Covering Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of rice grains from various routes became more active, with more than 30 trucks of Kuntai goods arriving, as well as more than 20 trucks of Su, Tong, Qingfeng, and other goods. However, the rising trend in the market did not show any signs of abating, and became even more intense. Speculators had ulterior motives, and cargo owners were even more reluctant to release samples easily. As buyers from all sides sought it more eagerly, it created a situation of rising prices step by step yesterday. Rice merchants and vendors, fearing being scolded, were fortunately able to use news propaganda, even saying that this rise was a strategy to reward vendors for bringing in goods, so they specially raised the selling price to cover up their manipulation, which can be said to be good at covering up. The opening price rose by one yuan, and then it was raised higher and higher, to two or three yuan. At this time, speculators suddenly took the opportunity to sell at a high price, so the mid-market slightly weakened, but ultimately the recovery was not large, and it suddenly returned to its original state. Unexpectedly, after this suppression, it became even more intensified. Regardless of whether it was Japonica or Indica, the highest price was actually as much as four yuan higher than the previous market price. General customers suddenly changed their style and shifted their attention to the kiln tea variety, which lacked large-scale sales. Therefore, as the price of this product was still lower than other products, they also deliberately sought it, resulting in a closing price of 33 yuan, also up three yuan. In addition, the closing price of Changbang Special Japonica reached 36 yuan, Kunsu White Japonica also reached 34 yuan and 45 cents, Special Luyang Indica 33-34 yuan, Jiangbei Indica and Jingwu Indica 32.5-32 yuan, all rose sharply by three to four yuan compared to the previous market price. Yinbian Yuan, because the path to market is not as wide as other products, is two yuan higher, Chen is 36 yuan, Xin is 34-35 yuan, and Yin Yuan is 33-34 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for Ke Xian rice was even more prosperous, because there were reports that Japanese merchants were directly exporting rice from the production areas, so the daily arrival volume decreased. Chinese merchants were still restricted, and Jiangbei Xian rice was inconvenient to transport. The rice loaded half a month ago had not yet arrived at the port, so the rice stocks on the market were monopolized and manipulated by speculators. Rumors were rampant, and people were confused. New speculators did not care about the price and rushed to buy, so the morning price rose by one yuan, and the mid-market price rose by an additional two yuan, about three yuan higher than the previous day, but the actual transaction volume did not exceed 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>In addition to the previously agreed 2,900 tons of foreign rice, yesterday rice merchants and firms added another 1,000 tons to be loaded, so it can arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. It will still be sold by Dafoo Foreign Firm at a price of 33.5 yuan. There are still two or three batches that are being negotiated, and it is difficult to predict whether they will be completed.</p>
<h3>Flour Following Step by Step</h3>
<p>The flour market price remains at the original price, but because the rice price has been rising step by step for several days, people's minds inevitably have a positive outlook. In addition, it is rumored that various factories have reduced the number of trucks, which has aroused the favor of scattered speculators. However, as it is the weekend, actual sales are still limited. As a result, the transaction volume is about 40,000 bags. The base price of No. 2 flour is 7.2 yuan, and the customer price and artillery car flour are several cents to a dime higher. The recovery of the goods from the warehouse has also increased by several cents to a dime. It is also heard that the price of Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also increased, from 6.95 yuan in October to 7.15 yuan in November. On the 19th, 500 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is still scarce. Recently, the sales market has been flat for a long time, but the suppliers have become more determined to sell due to high costs and high grain prices. The Tong market traded 5,000 bags of wheat from the Fufan and Liang factories to Changxi and Zhenjiang. Speculators opened four or five trucks, resulting in a market that was slightly stronger than before by three to five cents.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Raw Soybean Oil A Short Rest</h3>
<p>—But the Increase Has Been Quite Significant—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market prices of soybean oil and peanut oil both turned stable. This is because soybean oil has risen sharply by eight or nine yuan in seven days, and raw oil has risen sharply by three to four yuan, causing actual sales to decline. However, those who are making a fortune from the national crisis have not yet been satisfied, so there is still an undertow of slow progress in its potential. Yesterday, the Tong market traded 500 cans of Jiangbei raw oil and 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, all sold at the original price of the previous day. In addition to Qingdao oil rising slightly by 30 cents, with a price of 75.3 yuan, 40 barrels were traded. In addition, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at 58 yuan.</p>
<p>2820 bags of North Shalaizi soybeans and 530 bags from Qiya came.</p>
<p>Today, 1640 bags of soybeans and 540 bags of raw kernels were shipped to Hong Kong, and 330 bags of soybeans and 110 bags of sorghum were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Finance Hong Kong Bankers Buying Gold The Local Market May Be Able to Slightly Reverse the Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot bare gold gray market situation, although in the midst of human fatigue, did not fall. The result was no glory or disgrace compared to the day before yesterday. Among them, the ones who were selling more vigorously were the securities firms, and the reason why the market situation was pulled back was due to the one-time search and entry by Hong Kong bankers, which was sufficient to offset it. The opening price was the same as the previous day, originally 3630 yuan, and then the first buyer was a bullish money exchange business that had sold out the day before, so it rose to a high of 3645 yuan. However, the securities firms came to sell and stuff it, fortunately supported by the pawnshop bankers, and began to hover between 3630 and 3640 yuan. As a result, after 11 o'clock, there was a sudden report that the exchange rate was suddenly loose and hard. At that time, the buyers were unable to continue and stood by and watched, while the securities firms took the opportunity to open a selling boom, coupled with the frequent and continuous release of a certain bank and gold shop, and once fell to a low of 3615 yuan. Around noon, the large buyer Hong Kong bankers vigorously absorbed it, because the gold price in Hong Kong was reported to be good, and entered about 300 taels of light, and the foreign exchange stopped loosening and was slightly stable, and finally reported back to 3633 yuan. Soon after, it was closed at 3630 yuan, but according to the settlement of the US exchange rate, it actually fell by as much as 427 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday relationship, there was no market in the field, and there were few people outside the field, and transactions were not easy. Because a certain securities firm also absorbed on behalf of the Hong Kong bankers, it was heard that it had been made as high as 3650 yuan, and then slightly returned to flat. Finally, someone sold at 3645 yuan. The transaction was smooth in the morning, with more than 1,000 taels. The pawnshop's jewelry gold did not move all day, and the customs gold and other gold were still flat.</p>
<p>Bare Gold Did Not Distinguish Between High and Low</p>
<p>From the morning, each strip (ten taels), the initial opening was stable. First, the pawnshop bankers entered 20 taels from the money exchange industry, still at 3630 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business was excited to buy, and vigorously entered more than 300 taels. Although a certain bank and retail investors took the opportunity to sell, the head position still felt narrow. Soon after, it rose by 15 yuan, and the money exchange industry did 30 taels with each other, for 3645 yuan. At that time, the securities firms suddenly started a selling boom, and the buyers had enough appetite, so the price could not be sustained and fell back. In a short while, it fell by 12 yuan, and the securities firms sold 20 taels to the gold shop, for 3633 yuan. Later, the pawnshop bankers collected on behalf of customers, raising it by 10 yuan, and the pawnshop bankers entered 40 taels from the securities firms, for 3643 yuan. Although the gold shop and the money exchange industry came to compete for sale, the buyers still had a good appetite, so the price once wandered between 3630 and 3640 yuan. It was not until about 11 o'clock that the exchange rate suddenly reported a loose trend, and the entrants suddenly became less, coupled with the increasingly strong selling intention of the securities firms, etc., and fell to 3615 yuan. Near noon, the Hong Kong bankers suddenly came and absorbed about 300 taels, and the foreign exchange also stopped loosening and turned flat, and the trend suddenly turned flat. In an instant, it rose by 18 yuan, and the pawnshop bankers entered 50 taels from the money exchange industry, for 3633 yuan. After falling back by 3 yuan, the money exchange industry spit out 30 taels to a certain pawnshop, for 3630 yuan, as the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, Saturday was a holiday, and the result was no difference from the previous day, only 30 yuan up and down for half a day. The selling price of the current number's own brand gold is 10 yuan higher than that of bare gold, and the purchase price is reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current marked gold is about 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still Suspended at the Original Price</p>
<p>The exchange price of pawnshop jewelry gold per tael has not changed all day. Datonghang is still suspended at 370 yuan, the same as the upper price of Xintonghang. The purchase price is reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Quiet Currency Exchange Market: Slight Loosening After US and Hong Kong Banks' Initial Hesitation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial GBP/USD market remained ordinary due to the shortened Saturday trading hours. Trading was sparse, but the underlying trend still indicated a firm tone. Major operators had shown no significant activity in the past few days, leaving future changes to be seen in the coming Monday. The morning began with a continued shrinking of USD against GBP by three points, leading to a repeat of the initial tight USD and stable GBP situation. GBP was at 5/28125, and USD at 8.5625. The market then became quiet. Although a Chinese bank tried to buy USD for delivery this month, it had no impact. Around 11 AM, Hong Kong banks suddenly offered to sell, coupled with the emergence of US banks' willingness to sell, also acting on behalf of exporters. This caused the situation to slightly harden, reaching 5/34375 and 8.6875. HSBC, seeing the low prices, was eager to buy in, causing a slight softening to 5/3125 and 8.625. By the close, the rates were still at 5/34375 and 8.65625, each loosening by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The trend in futures was similar to that of spot rates.</p>

Subsequently, Chinese banks and Xingye came to buy USD for delivery this month at 8.5625. The situation remained very calm, with little price fluctuation. Around 11 AM, Hong Kong suddenly offered to sell, and at the same time, US banks such as Chase also sold. As a result, the situation gradually hardened. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers (T/T) were sold to foreign banks such as HSBC at 5/3125 and 34375 for spot GBP. Then, Chase also sold spot USD at 8.625 and 65625 to foreign banks such as Youli. The USD was once quoted at 8.6875. Sellers then stopped selling, and the rate softened back to 5/3125 and 8.625. By the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 5/34375 for GBP and 8.65625 for USD, and 5/28125 for December/January GBP and 8.53125 for USD.

<h3>Securities: Lively Trading in Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Slight Fluctuations in Domestic Debt</p>
<p>The unofficial securities market was extremely quiet yesterday morning, fluctuating between 0.05 and 0.1 yuan.

It being Saturday, the generally weak and unsubstantial short sellers also covered their positions, actually raising prices by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. However, market sentiment remained weak and listless. Yesterday morning, from opening to close, the prices floated within a very small range, with no enthusiasm on either the buying or selling side. The afternoon closing prices were only up or down by 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, the bulls took advantage of the opportunity, with some raising prices and others selling off, and retail investors followed suit to cover their positions, actually raising prices by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. However, the underlying foundation did not appear strong. The final market prices recovered by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan to 0.35 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 400,000 yuan.

<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Guohua Bank were traded, at a price of 43 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market for various companies opened slightly quiet, then gradually became active. Trading was relatively lively in the half-day, but the range of price fluctuations seemed narrow, and the trend was difficult to grasp. Only Shanghai Silver Company shares, Jardine Matheson shares, and Steel Industry shares rarely looked back after recording high opening prices. Rubber shares were also firm. Most of the trading was limited to Kroewoekoe and Langkat shares, with nothing else worth mentioning.</p>
<p>London, 17th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained calm, with no changes in any of the bonds.</p>
<p>London, 17th: Today's listed prices for British Far East companies' stocks mostly rose firmly. Shanghai Waterworks A shares rose by one pound, to 11 pounds.

<p>The British-owned Hengye Real Estate Co., Ltd. resolved at yesterday's board meeting to pay a dividend of 0.4 yuan per share for the year ending at the end of September of this year, which will be paid on a fixed date after being approved by the annual shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>The 27th annual shareholders' meeting of Guanshengyuan Food Co., Ltd. was held the other day. The current dividend will be paid at an annual interest rate of 8%, starting from the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Maling Canned Food Co., Ltd. is scheduled to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the 19th of this month to discuss the issue of increasing capital. It is reported that the company's original capital was 200,000 yuan, and it is now planned to increase it by 200,000 yuan, making a total of 400,000 yuan. Of the new capital, 100,000 yuan will be allocated from this year's surplus, and the remaining 100,000 yuan will be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to their shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Difficult Transportation on All Sides, Yarn Sales Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Shanghai Yarn Factories Have Huge Profits</p>
<p>The yarn market remains scattered and weak, with a depressed situation. This is due to weak actual demand and difficult transportation on all sides, resulting in softened sentiment. Most operators are suffering heavy losses, but are unwilling to sacrifice and settle. Therefore, although the trend is not good, everyone is standing idly by without taking action, resulting in increasingly sluggish transactions and narrow fluctuations. Judging from the general trend, the future needs actual sales to support it, and the market is unlikely to see a new situation.</p>
<p>The opening of the current yarn market was extremely bleak, with scattered participants and chaotic sentiment. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 632 yuan, with only 10 bales traded. Soon, there were many sellers, but even fewer buyers, creating a scene of complete idleness. The price then dropped another step to 628 yuan, with little excitement in the middle. The closing price recovered by two yuan to 630 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume for the half-day was only 525 bales, compared to 165 bales traded in the afternoon of the previous day. 20-count Double Horse fell by 3.5 yuan, Tiannv fell by 3 yuan, and Double Earth fell by 3 yuan. Only 10-count coarse yarn was flat. Today, 55 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, 125 pieces to Hong Kong, and 160 pieces to Xiamen. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade: 32 lines: Hong Kong: 155</p>
<p>Inland: 25: Ningbo: 20</p>
<p>Previous Day's Transactions: 165</p>
<p>Two-Day Transaction Statistics: 690</p>
<p>Tonglai Yarn Factory is making exceptionally high profits, especially the Japanese factories. For example, the Shanghai Yarn Factory Co., Ltd., a Japanese-owned company in this city, resolved at yesterday's board meeting to pay a dividend of 5 yuan per share for the six months ending at the end of October of this year. It is reported that the factory's surplus for this period reached more than 4.6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Factories Continue to Purchase American Cotton</h3>
<p>Domestic Cotton Only Appealing to Fellow Traders</p>
<p>Transactions in domestic cotton are limited to those appealing to fellow traders, but are not smooth. There are only slight purchases to embellish the market, so the market remains calm. This is because yarn prices are not rising, and manufacturers have no intention of replenishing raw materials, and are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. Japanese merchants are also taking the same approach. The supply from northern Jiangsu continues unabated, arriving with 4,090 bales, Changyinsha with more than 900 bales, and cotton from Beisha with 1,840 bales. The current situation of cotton is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tonghua: 134.00 | 136.00 | 135.00 | 146.25 | Traders Buying In: 492 Bales</p>
<p>Huoji: 129.00 | 129.50 | 128.50 | Also | 300 Bales</p>
<p>Xiasahua: 136.50 | Also | 100 Bales</p>
<p>Pingguoer: 118.00 | Also | 100 Pieces</p>
<p>Another report: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days. Factories are still reluctant to buy in because yarn prices are not rising. However, each factory has very little inventory of long-fiber raw cotton. Traders, in view of this, have successively ordered thousands of bales. Yesterday, Shenxin also intended to purchase long-fiber raw cotton, so it ordered more than 1,000 pieces of this American cotton, all of which are ready to be shipped, and the price delivered to the factory is about 190 yuan. Xinyu also purchased several hundred pieces of American cotton for spinning 24-count yarn. Other factories have not been heard to have placed orders.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very active yesterday morning. Overseas cotton merchants were buying strongly in the market, causing cotton prices to rise by 5 to 6 pound sounds. Later, because there were fewer buyers, most bulls took profits, and banks sold out, turning softer. As a result, at the close, prices fell by 3 to 4 pound sounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose one rupee including forecasts yesterday. The Egyptian cotton market rose 40 to 100 pound sounds. Liverpool rose 10 pence.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Forced Short Covering Leads to Price Increase, National Cloth Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Following the previous market's sluggish momentum, the morning opening for cotton cloth remained soft. Retailers were eager to sell their holdings, further reducing prices by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan per piece. Then, due to forced short covering in Eastern cloth, prices rebounded, and the market also turned firm. Selling was flat, and transactions were more lively at local dyeing factories and wholesale houses. Transactions included 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of grey fabrics such as fine cloth and fine twill, 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, printed cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth. In northern Jiangsu and Jingwu areas, 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of goods such as blue cloth and colored twill were traded. The Nanyang gang purchased approximately 1,000 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Due to active local sales, the market sentiment for Eastern cloth, white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill turned firm. The current quoted selling price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 17.65 yuan per piece, and fine twill at 16.75 yuan, each raised by 0.15 yuan per piece. Four Gentlemen broadcloth also recovered to 0.57 to 0.5725 yuan per yard. In the morning market, Nisshin Yoko opened 200 parcels of Longtou Blue Double Fish and Suzhou Color Ball fine cloth. The quoted price for Longtou Blue Double Fish spot was 16.35 yuan per piece, and Suzhou Color Ball was only 16.4 yuan per piece. In summary, local customers purchased more than 800 pieces of white goods.</p>
<p>Exports: 100 pieces shipped to Xiamen on the 19th, 160 pieces to Hong Kong, 50 pieces to Tule, and 5 pieces to Siam.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Balls Sold at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, due to competition among various factories, coal ball prices have been secretly lowered, with low prices emerging. Yitaixing and Guohua Coal Balls reduced prices by 2 yuan yesterday. The price for self-pickup by traders is 57 yuan per ton, and delivered is 58 yuan. As a result, various small factories also followed suit, dare not hold on. Reducing the burden on people's livelihood is currently a pressing need. However, the retail prices in local stores vary, ranging from 3.1 to 3.12 yuan per 100 catties.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Transactions Turn Active</h3>
<p>Although the trend for domestic sugar is soft, transactions between firms are gradually becoming active. Yesterday, Huanggang Qing opened at 35 yuan, Ban Nan Qing at 33 yuan, Fan Chi at 35 yuan, and second-grade at 32 yuan, with a total of more than 300 bags traded. The market for foreign sugar set by the guild was flat, with slight fluctuations. Local godown number 24 coarse was 51 yuan, new arrivals from foreign godowns were slightly higher at 52 yuan, and old goods were 51.5 yuan, the same as the previous day. Repackaged goods remained at 41.5 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark and others were unchanged. H Mark Car Chi was slightly lower at 40 yuan. Local cotton white was slightly higher at 0.5 yuan, number one was 51 yuan, and the rest remained the same. Local number one ice rose by 0.5 yuan to 62.5 yuan, number two was 62 yuan, and Jingming ice was 64 yuan.</p>

<h3>Western Reporters Return to Shanghai After Inspection: Discussing the Cause and Effect of the Great Victory in Northern Hunan, Chinese Army Highly Disciplined and Brave in Combat, County Magistrate Personally Leads Guerrillas to Intercept</h3>
<p>In early October, the Chinese army achieved a great victory in the northern Hunan area. Western reporters, under the invitation of the Central Propaganda Department, organized an inspection tour to the former front. According to a Western reporter who recently returned to Shanghai from Chongqing, the Chinese army's victory was several times greater than the Taierzhuang battle. The combat area stretched from northern Hunan to Wuning in northern Jiangxi, covering an area of no less than 250 square miles. The fighting lasted for 10 days. Although the Japanese army spent a month prior</p>
<p>Long-term preparation</p>
<p>the number of combatants was also more than the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army was able to use extremely clever tactics to defeat them all. The Japanese army not only failed to advance a single step, but in several places retreated several miles further than before. Between October 2 and 5, the Japanese army was cut into several sections by the Chinese army. When the Japanese commander Okamura decided to</p>
<p>Order a retreat</p>
<p>he had no way to convey his order. In desperation, he used an airplane to convey it, but the plane crashed in the mountains near Tongcheng, and failed to complete its mission. In fact, the Japanese troops on each front had been automatically retreating in a disheveled manner since October 2. In addition to clever tactics, there are three reasons for the Chinese army's victory this time: (1) The soldiers gave their lives. When the Japanese army first attacked,</p>
<p>Their momentum was quite strong</p>
<p>Later, two Chinese county magistrates personally led 5,000 guerrillas to intercept their rear troops fiercely, making it impossible for the front and rear to take care of each other, and their momentum was thwarted. (2) Thorough arrangement. In advance, the Chinese army had destroyed all the highways south of the Xinqiang River, so that the Japanese army's mechanical units could not move after arriving in the area, greatly reducing their combat power. Moreover, due to transportation difficulties, the soldiers</p>
<p>Insufficient supplies</p>
<p>They felt even more distressed. (3) Strict military discipline. All the Chinese troops fighting in the province were highly disciplined and brave in combat. Even if they were injured in several places, they still fought hard and did not retreat. They also maintained close contact with the people, and even automatically helped the farmers with farming. The farmers also automatically helped to carry the wounded and served as guides. In summary, the Chinese troops on the front lines are not only morale-boosting and have sufficient military equipment, but also have far richer combat experience than the Japanese army. The future is very promising.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Implement Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Locking Down Alleys</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force is actively preparing for winter defense as the winter season approaches. In order to prevent bandits from acting rashly and rioters from causing trouble, in addition to locking down each alley connecting to the border-crossing areas of western Shanghai since the day before yesterday, the Engineering Office has also been requested since today to dispatch many workers to erect wooden posts and wrap them with barbed wire to completely block the alleys north of Avenue Edward VII, including Race Course Road, Route Massenet, Route Chongqing, Weihaiwei Road, Route Doumer, and Chengdu Road. Only one entrance and exit will be left in each alley. It is reported that the areas around Xin Zha Road, Macgregor Road, and Carter Road are also planned to be locked down within a few days.</p>

However, trade between the United Kingdom and France and Shanghai has also been significantly affected, as the number of British, French, and German merchant ships traveling on the Far East line has decreased due to the war.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Shoot at British Car, British Consulate Has Filed a Protest, Based on a Detailed Report from the Police Force, the British Consulate Protests to the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, a British Consul in Shanghai told a reporter last night (17th) that the British Consul General had lodged a protest with "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiaoyan regarding the shooting incident on Dufeng Road at 10 p.m. on Wednesday. The protest was filed because a "City Government" police officer had no obvious reason</p>
<p>Or warning</p>
<p>He opened fire on a British resident driving a car. The Public Concession Police Force submitted a detailed report on the matter to the British Consulate yesterday afternoon. After studying it, the British authorities protested to the "City Government." The process of the shooting incident is as follows: A British resident was driving a car north to south on Dufeng Road. At the intersection of Daxi Road, he saw a "City Government" policeman standing on the side of the road. But the policeman did not give a hand signal to stop the car, so the British resident</p>
<p>Continued to drive</p>
<p>But before the car reached the end of the road, a rifle shot was heard. A bullet whizzed past the car. The British resident was not injured and accelerated into McGee Road. After receiving the report, the British military authorities requested the "City Government Police Department" to explain, but yesterday</p>
<p>There was no reply</p>
<p>The British Consul General lodged a protest yesterday. The British military authorities have confirmed the number of the policeman who fired the shot. The British resident who was shot at kept his name confidential and did not disclose it.</p>
<h3>Successive Transactions of Tribute Rice; Large Quantities of National Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai for Storage Within Days; Market Prices Fluctuate and Have Not Yet Moved onto the Right Track</h3>
<p>Various rice trading firms in this city, seeing that the Saigon authorities have already lifted the ban and permitted the export of rice, have jointly commissioned the French firm D'Affoux to telegraph Saigon rice merchants to order large quantities of tribute rice to be shipped to Shanghai for market regulation. In addition to the 500 tons already transacted and loaded onto ships yesterday, another 1,900 tons, totaling 19,000 bags, have also been negotiated and are expected to arrive in early next month. This tribute rice was purchased by rice shops such as Shuntai, Houde, Tairun, and Shunfeng in this city, and the selling price is 30.60 yuan per 198 catties.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Encourages the Transportation of National Rice</p>
<p>According to news from various firms in the rice market, there is no fear of shortage. Currently, in national rice-producing areas, except for Wuhu, which has been entirely purchased by Japanese merchants, other places such as Changshu, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou are all permitted to transport rice to Shanghai for market regulation. However, due to transportation delays and difficulties, it is reported that large quantities of national rice will be shipped to Shanghai for storage within days. Currently, rice industry groups are rewarding merchants who transport national rice, and once the goods arrive, their selling prices will be assessed separately and sold on the market. Moreover, rice-producing areas are full of stock, and it is expected that within half a month, the rice stock in the Shanghai market will gradually increase. As for merchants and residents who are storing up for emergencies, there are already quite a few.</p>
<p>Prices Rise and Fall Without Basis</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, rice prices rose again. According to people in the rice industry, recently small households have been crowding to hoard, and some with strong financial resources are buying recklessly. After the price of indica rice rose, the price of japonica rice also rose, and had no choice but to follow suit. In reality, Shanghai is full of white japonica rice, so the recent rice prices in Shanghai have not moved onto the right track.</p>
<p>Body of Japanese Rice Merchant Found</p>
<p>A Japanese named Sato Kinji came to Shanghai in March this year and took advantage of the special environment to open a Sato Automobile Company on Dongbaoxing Road in Zhabei, and also set up a rice shop nearby to make profits. Although it has only been a few months, the profits are quite substantial. Every month, he must go to the villages in the Hongqiao area of ​​western Shanghai three times to buy rice. At about 11:00 AM on the 15th of this month, the Japanese once again led three empty trucks to Hongqiao to collect rice. Unexpectedly, when passing near Tangjiaxing on Hongqiao Road, he suddenly encountered four strong men holding box cannons, who ordered him to stop and dragged the Japanese down and kidnapped him. Although the Japanese army sent teams to search afterwards, there was no whereabouts. It was not until the afternoon of the 16th that someone discovered his body floating in a small river outside the town, and the Japanese side retrieved it to the shore for burial.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American-Japanese Conference Just a Rumor</h3>
<p>Even Suma is Unaware</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Japanese side yesterday (the 17th) rumored that Sir Kerr, Johnson, and Kato would soon hold a triangular meeting in Shanghai, but this has not been confirmed by the American and British sides. According to Japanese sources, the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and Japan in China are about to meet to review Tokyo's relations with Washington and London in relation to China. The news pointed out that the return of the British ambassador to Shanghai was not just a coincidence, and the American ambassador has also left Chongqing and is now in Hong Kong, on his way to Shanghai. At the same time, it is recalled that the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said when hosting foreign journalists at the Broadway Mansion on Thursday evening that he was completely unaware that such negotiations would take place in Shanghai. However, according to Japanese sources, the British government has notified all countries, including Japan, of its intention to withdraw British troops from North China, but has not notified Chongqing. Although Chongqing is well aware of Britain's decision, the fact that it has not received notification is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Europe Return Home One After Another; First Batch of Dutch Overseas Chinese Arrives in Shanghai; Difficulties in Business After the War Lead to Many Job Losses</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the situation in Germany and Belgium has become increasingly tense, and the Dutch government has also actively prepared for war, causing great damage to the business of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands. Due to the daily pressure of livelihood, they have prepared to come to China one after another. The first batch of 41 Dutch overseas Chinese, including Hu Yimin and Pan Mingxian, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th on the Comte de Fours, the same ship as the French overseas Chinese. They are all originally from Wenzhou, Qingti, Rui'an and other places in Zhejiang, and have lived in the Netherlands for a long time, engaged in small businesses selling carpets and foreign goods. After arriving in Shanghai, due to unfamiliarity with the place, they were received by the Wenzhou Shanghai Association and lodged in hotels, planning to wait for a ship to Ningbo and then go to Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Overseas Chinese Prepare to Return Home</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Juexin of the Wenzhou Association in Shanghai, who received the returning overseas Chinese, there are about 2,000 overseas Chinese from Zhejiang living in the Netherlands. Before the Sino-Japanese War, most of them were engaged in selling Japanese goods. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in China have boycotted Japanese goods, and at the same time, various countries have also banned the import of Japanese goods. Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands have also changed to selling other foreign goods or directly purchasing domestic goods from China and transporting them to the Netherlands for sale. Although the cost is huge and the profit is minimal, they are willing to save money and work hard. Since the outbreak of the European War, the sources of various goods have been scarce, and the purchasing power of foreigners has been weak, causing business to plummet. At present, it is unprofitable for overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, so most of them are preparing to return home. Those who came to Shanghai this time are not many, and there are still a large number of overseas Chinese who are applying to the consulate for passports, preparing to wait for a ship to return home.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in France Describe the Situation in Detail</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Ye Tinghuan, an overseas Chinese who returned from France, yesterday. According to him, since the outbreak of the European war in France, all men of age in the country have been conscripted for military service, so individual overseas Chinese engaged in industry and commerce in France have been invited to work in French factories. In the past, those who worked in French factories received about 7 to 12 francs per hour. After the war, factories reduced their expenses and lowered wages. Recently, in addition to providing food and lodging, each person is only given 5 francs per day, which is very different from before the war. Therefore, the livelihood of overseas Chinese working in factories has become unsustainable. As for overseas Chinese engaged in commerce, due to the scarcity of various goods and the sharp decline in sales, they have become stagnant. There are many overseas Chinese in France, and many have lost their jobs due to the impact of the European war. If the European situation continues to deteriorate, the livelihood prospects of overseas Chinese will be in an unimaginable situation. Most overseas Chinese are preparing to return home, but travel is inconvenient and costly during the war. It is hoped that the consulates can find ways to provide relief so that overseas Chinese can return home conveniently.</p>
<h3>Permanently Commemorate Ma Xiangbo; Raise Scholarship Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo received a suggestion from Mr. Ying Yongyu yesterday: Respected Sirs, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a member of the National Government and an elder statesman, passed away on the 4th of this month. Upon receiving the telegram in Shanghai, all circles were deeply saddened and established a preparatory committee to carry out the memorial service. Considering that Mr. Ma dedicated his life to education and founded schools, in order to permanently commemorate Mr. Ma and to cultivate talents for the country, Ying Yongyu hereby suggests that your committee raise 100,000 yuan for the "Mr. Ma Xiangbo Memorial Scholarship." In addition to immediately telegraphed the National Government to allocate funds, a telegram should be sent to all circles across the country to jointly conduct fundraising activities to form a committee responsible for managing the funds and hosting annual public examinations in the future, so that outstanding young people from poor families across the country have the opportunity to study, to seek happiness for the people. Please proceed quickly, which is truly convenient for the public. Mr. Ying Yongyu also suggested to Fudan and Aurora universities to add free academic spots in the name of Ma Xiangbo.</p>

<h3>Mitsui Not Satisfied with Seizing Eggs, Entrapping People in Injustice; Asking a British Company to Pick Up Eggs of an American Company; The Goal is to Create Disputes Between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that the Mitsui Company has repeatedly decided to forcibly seize the eggs of foreign companies in Shanghai, and now it is employing a trick to deceive. Recently, an American company in this city purchased a batch of eggs, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The Mitsui Company forcibly seized them and allocated a portion, notifying a British company to pick them up. It turns out that the Mitsui Company had seized hundreds of baskets of eggs from the British company in recent weeks, and intended to compensate them with these eggs of the American company. When the British company inspected the eggs, they found that the labels of the shipper entrusted by Wang Shuming had been torn off. Then they learned that this batch of eggs was actually purchased by an American company on the Yangtze River estuary. If they accept these eggs, they will be accused by the original American company of receiving stolen goods. If the original owner takes back this batch of eggs, the British company will have no hope of recovering the seized eggs. However, the American and British companies have now contacted each other to discuss this matter, so the Mitsui Company's plan to cause disputes between the two companies and escape responsibility itself may not succeed.</p>
<h3>Dredging Project, All Previous Efforts Wasted</h3>
<p>The silted beach and Yuji Mound on the river, after suspension, water conservancy is hindered</p>
<p>The dredging bureau's dredgers, including Jianshe, Hailong, Haihu, Haibao, Haima, Haili, Haita, and the surveying ship Lilang, a total of more than ten large and small vessels, have been detained by the Japanese side. The whereabouts of each ship, except for Jianshe, which is currently docked in the Yangshupu River, are largely unknown. The cost of building the above dredgers came from the dredger donation levied by the Jianghai Customs on Chinese and foreign ships entering and leaving the port of Shanghai, so the bureau is of an international nature. Therefore, the Customs Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Merger and others repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, and the consular corps was also very concerned, but it was ultimately abandoned due to the harsh conditions put forward by the Japanese side. The dredging projects that have been suspended as a result include the silted beach project outside the Wusong Estuary, the Wusong River project from Fanhuangdu to Yuji Mound, and various sections of the Huangpu River project. Among them, the silted beach dredging was designed by the former chief engineer of the bureau, Mr. Chatley. The initial dredging was scheduled for five years. Once completed, any large ship could enter and exit the Huangpu River. Now all previous efforts have been wasted.</p>
<h3>Ninth Installment of Principal and Interest on the Yuping Public Bond to be Paid at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Paying Agencies are the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications</p>
<p>The National Government previously issued 12 million yuan of the 23rd Year Yuping Railway Public Bond of the Republic of China to build the Yudu-Pingxiang Railway in Jiangxi Province. The ninth installment of principal was drawn by lottery, and the lottery was held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The winning tickets and the interest due will be paid by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in various places starting from the 30th of this month. The principal to be repaid is 840,000 yuan, together with the interest, has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office to order the Xiping Inspection Office to allocate 1.93 million yuan annually from the local salt surtax donations transferred by the Central Government to Jiangxi as a fund for repayment of principal and interest. It is said that it has been transferred to the Central Bank for special storage for payment.</p>
<h3>Canadian Priest Dies Tragically; British Consulate Considers it Closed; Actually Thanking the Japanese Commander for His Care</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese Army spokesman claimed to reporters yesterday (the 17th) that the British Consul in Nanjing, Alexander, visited the Japanese commander in Xuzhou on Thursday to thank the Japanese for their treatment of a Canadian priest who died at the hands of Japanese soldiers. The British also agreed with the Japanese that the matter was closed. The talks were informal. The Japanese commander expressed regret over the death of the priest.</p>
<h3>Three US Agencies in Shanghai to Implement Joint Office; Increase Efficiency According to the President's Plan; Will Become a Well-Coordinated Unit Thereafter</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that the US Consul General Gauss has recently explained to local reporters the establishment of a separate foreign affairs department proposed by US President Roosevelt and approved by the US Congress, saying that under the new plan, the US Department of Commerce and the Foreign Agricultural Department of the Department of Agriculture will be incorporated into the Foreign Affairs Department of the State Department in order to improve work efficiency. Therefore, before November 1, the three US offices in Shanghai, namely the US Commercial Counselor's Office, the US Agricultural Commissioner's Office, and the US Consulate General, which are located in the central district of this city, will move to the Construction Building together, occupying the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors respectively. This will become "a single and well-coordinated unit" to eliminate duplicate work under the general management of the Consul General and the Counselor of the Embassy, ​​and under the direct supervision and command of the US Commercial Counselor Anlider. Mr. Tuosen, the Agricultural Commissioner who is on vacation in the United States, is scheduled to leave the United States today (the 18th) by ship to return to Shanghai and continue to handle agricultural affairs.</p>
<h3>Telephone Lines in Western Shanghai and Hongkou are Often Cut and Stolen</h3>
<p>Due to the surge in the population of the concession, the business of the Shanghai Telephone Company is developing rapidly. The original overhead and underground cables, as well as switchboards, etc., are insufficient for distribution, so some users often resell their licenses, which has a great impact on the business. In addition to announcing a ban, the company is also expanding its lines to meet the needs of the citizens. However, in remote areas of western Shanghai and Hongkou, thieves often cut and steal overhead wires and rubber-covered wires on the outside walls, as well as various other parts, which often obstructs telephone calls. A reward was offered for the arrest of these thieves, but in the end, due to their secretive actions, the case could not be solved. Therefore, the company specifically asked the Public Concession Police Department to issue a notice yesterday. If someone reports a case that is concluded by the court and convicted, the reward will be 100 yuan. When reporting the information, you can directly report to the police stations.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Promotes Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Submitted to Chairman Chiang for Approval; Has Instructed Branches in Various Places to Comply</p>
<p>In order to develop domestic agriculture, the China Farmers Bank has formulated the principles of agricultural promotion loans and submitted them to Chairman Chiang for approval. The principles of the loan are distributed to the farmers' branches in various places to follow. The loan principles are as follows: (1) The China Farmers Bank formulates these principles in order to assist in the advancement of agricultural undertakings and promote production; (2) The scope of loans or investments is limited to the following types of undertakings, and may be expanded at any time in the future as needed: (A) Purchasing improved agricultural seeds that have been tested and proven effective for promotion; (B) Processing and manufacturing fertilizers (such as bone fertilizer); (C) Manufacturing effective pesticides for preventing and controlling crop diseases and pests; (D) Manufacturing improved agricultural tools that have been tested and proven effective. The above-mentioned seeds and various manufactured products should be promoted to farmers by agricultural promotion agencies as much as possible to achieve universal effectiveness; (3) The targets of loans are agricultural promotion agencies or the manufacturers themselves, but the borrowers must have specialized technical personnel and concrete plans for the borrowed business, and must raise 30% of the funds themselves; (4) The standards, terms, interest rates, guarantees, and detailed methods of various loans shall be determined according to local conditions; (5) When applying for a loan from the bank, the promotion or work plan must be sent to the bank's agricultural loan management offices in each province for review and approval before implementation after the agreement is prepared and approved by the head office; (6) The agricultural promotion agencies that have obtained loans from the bank shall submit the progress of the work each year, and the bank shall send personnel to inspect the accounts and work conditions at any time.

These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the chairman.</p>
<h3>Released by the French Government of Vietnam; Metals and Hardware Shipped to Shanghai; Paper Supply Not to be Cut Off and Prices Rise; Value of Metals and Hardware Will Also Fall</h3>
<p>In recent years, our country has been actively promoted the papermaking industry by the Ministry of Industry, which has a vigorous atmosphere, because it has a great relationship with culture, and it should not be completely dependent on others. Among them, the largest scale is the Wenxi Paper Mill, which has been preparing for several years before it was completed, and was ultimately suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. There was once a proposal to move to Kunming, but the outbreak of the European War, although the efficiency between China and Europe was not interrupted because of this, the transportation was difficult, and the detention and delay along the way were particularly complicated, resulting in no definite date for the arrival of the goods. The price of goods has risen strangely as a result. The large quantities of paper that merchants in Shanghai had ordered from European countries before the European war initially arrived in Shanghai, but were later detained in Haiphong, so the price of newspapers in Shanghai gradually increased. It is now heard that a large number of papers, metal materials, and various foreign goods, etc., that were blocked in Haiphong have been allowed to be released by the French government of Vietnam after the efforts of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Haiphong. They will be loaded and shipped to Shanghai within days. As for the foreign goods, they are still under negotiation, so there will be no shortage of paper in Shanghai, and prices will also fall.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Fake Officials to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>The Main Culprit is at Large; A Woman is Arrested</p>
<p>A Ningbo native surnamed Wei, who lives at No. 2, Gengyu Lane, Pope Road, in the French Concession, often said to his brother-in-law, Tang Jianxiong, that he was working in the Jianghai Customs of the fake organization. Because the Customs has recently added six sub-stations in other places to collect taxes, it is urgent to recruit personnel, with a monthly salary of 88 yuan, but each person must pay 300 yuan for activity expenses. Taking his sister-in-law's home as a liaison office, unemployed people, eager to find a job, went to contact the Tang siblings and paid the activity fees to the Tang siblings, waiting for a job without end. This matter was detected by Detective Zhang Xiaofa of the French Police Department, and he went to arrest Tang Jianxiong, who had already fled upon hearing the news. He then arrested his sister, Wei's wife, for investigation. It was found that Lou Zhengmin, Gao Gucheng, Yang Zhishan, and Wu Zhenhua had been deceived and paid 300 yuan for activity expenses. There were also more than ten people who had not been identified. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxu explained the case and requested a reform of the investigation, supplementing the arrest of the main culprit who was at large for further interrogation. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated the defendant Wei's wife, he ruled that the date would be changed to one month later, December 21, for further interrogation, because she was pregnant and due to give birth, and it was inconvenient to detain her. He also allowed the defendant to be released on bail by her defense lawyer.</p>
<h3>Industrialists Organize the Sino-American Chemical Industrial Plant</h3>
<p>Realizing the lack of domestic chemical raw materials and the scarcity and high prices of imported goods, Shanghai industrialists have jointly initiated the organization of the Sino-American Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Plant with well-known overseas Chinese businessmen. The plant specializes in the production of various chemical raw materials, such as hydrochloric acid and caustic soda, in order to promote industry and recover losses. The plant has strong capital and a large scale, and has specially hired experienced technicians and industrial experts to plan everything. The plant site is located in western Shanghai, and the construction of the plant is about to be completed. It is expected that it can officially ship goods in mid-December.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Decrease in Small Denomination Banknotes</h3>
<p>The number of one-jiao, two-jiao, and five-jiao subsidiary coins newly issued by the Bank of China circulating in the market today is indeed less than before. In fact, every year when autumn deepens and winter begins, businesses and banks must carry funds to the inland to purchase local products. The goods collected from the villagers are mostly collected in small batches, and the prices and numbers all have jiao and fen in the end. In order to make the collection of goods convenient, it is necessary to search and collect in Shanghai in advance. However, once it reaches mid-December, the villagers will turn to Shanghai to purchase goods in batches, and the small denomination banknotes that flow out will return to Shanghai in due course, so there is no fear of a lack of funds.</p>
<h3>Stealing Grandfather's Savings Passbook, Inciting the Crime and Sentencing to Imprisonment, Three Siblings Not Accepted</h3>
<p>Zhao Wenxuan, a 71-year-old man from Hangzhou who started out as a factory worker, was playing a board game with his concubine downstairs in his house at No. 62, Seymour Road, at 1:30 PM on the 8th of this month, when his grandson Fengzhang, Jinkun, and granddaughter Xunmei colluded to sneak into his bedroom upstairs and steal two bank passbooks, six seals, and 180 yuan in legal tender from a leather bag. They handed them over to their cousin, Shao Jiajun (a sophomore at Great China University), who instigated the crime. Shao Jiajun withdrew 3,500 yuan in legal tender from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road and the Bank of China on Tongfu Road with the two passbooks and seals, and temporarily deposited 1,700 yuan in the Pudong Bank on Aiduya Road. Afterwards, Shao Jiajun went to the home of his classmate, Zhao Bingying, a local from No. 5, Luban Road in the French Concession, and designed a threatening letter printed with lead characters (signed by the Caojiadu People's Self-Defense Corps, claiming that Zhao was selling enemy goods and had borrowed 3,500 yuan as military pay, which had been withdrawn from the bank, and now the passbooks and seals were returned, etc.), and gave Zhao Bingying 150 yuan. At 6:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, Zhao Bingying hired a car from the No. 8 Auto Company on Baiyubu Road. Zhao Bingying carried a package containing the threatening letter, the two bank passbooks, and the seals, and falsely claimed to be going to the Racecourse Da Guangming to watch a movie. As soon as he arrived at the cinema, he got out of the car and asked the driver, Chen Bugao, to take the package to Zhao Wenxuan's house on Seymour Road. The case was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent detectives to escort Zhao Fengzhang and his two siblings, Shao Jiajun, Zhao Bingying, five men and women in total, to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the Third Criminal Division to investigate and sentenced Shao Jiajun to six months' imprisonment, suspended for three years. For the civil lawsuit part, he was ordered to repay Zhao Wenxuan 940 yuan in national currency. Zhao Fengzhang, Zhao Jinkun, and Zhao Xunmei were not accepted, and their grandfather Zhao Wenxuan was ordered to take them back and discipline them. Zhao Bingying was acquitted and released.</p>

<h3>Written Appeal for Patricide Case: Reasons for Appeal – Key Points for Appeal – Original Trial Based on Single Charge – No Assessment of Psychological Abnormality – Evidence of Zhou Jing's Assistance Insufficient</h3>
<p>The sensational and shocking case of parricide, after the initial judgment by Judge Chuan Lin of the First Special Court, sentencing the rebellious sons Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang to death for jointly murdering their direct lineal ascendant, and their mother Zhou Jing to two years and six months imprisonment for assisting in the desecration of the body, has been extensively reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhou Jing and her two sons, Qinji and Qinxiang, have expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and retained lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, and Jiang Pingfan to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The written appeal, which was submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday, is excerpted below as a supplement to the reasons for the appeal. Regarding the case against Zhou Qinji et al. for murder and assisting in the desecration of the body, after receiving the initial judgment, an appeal was declared within the statutory period. The supplementary reasons for the appeal are stated below:</p>
<p>Single Charge</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the part of the appeal concerning the appellants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang jointly murdering their direct lineal ascendant (hereinafter referred to as the appellants), abolishing the death penalty is a recent trend advocated by scholars in criminal policy. Although our country cannot immediately adopt it, reducing the application of absolute death penalty as preparation for abolishing the death penalty can be derived from comparing past penal codes. Article 284 of the old criminal law prescribed the sole death penalty for murder committed with premeditation or by dismembering, cutting, or other cruel methods. This law</p>
<p>removes this provision</p>
<p>and includes life imprisonment as an alternative sentence. The intent of the law is to reduce the provisions for absolute death penalty and fully realize the spirit of the relative principle of legality of crime and punishment. Therefore, caution must be exercised when determining sentencing. In this case, the appellants confessed to the fact of murdering their ascendant, but their act of murder was by no means carried out in a cruel manner. The desecration of the body was solely for the purpose of preventing the discovery of the crime. Even if the methods used involved cruelty, only the part concerning the desecration of the body should be sentenced with the highest degree of punishment. According to the Supreme Court's Non-Character No. 7 Ruling of the 21st year,</p>
<p>the main point of the precedent</p>
<p>is that the result of the murder should be judged from the perspective of a single heavy charge. Since murder is a serious crime, it should be judged and sentenced according to the crime of murder. If the murder was not carried out in a cruel manner, there is no reason to impose the highest degree of punishment for the crime of murder and disregard the sentencing standards stipulated in Article 57 of the Criminal Law. Apart from the single heavy charge, the original trial disregarded other factors (to be elaborated later) and used it as a reason to impose the ultimate penalty, which is unconvincing.</p>
<p>Psychological Abnormality</p>
<p>(2) An act by a person who has lost their mind is not punishable (Article 19, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law). Furthermore, the punishment for an act by a person with diminished mental capacity should be reduced (Paragraph 2 of Article 19 of the same law). According to the provisions of the two paragraphs of this article, both refer to those with mental impairments, but to varying degrees. Those who have not completely lost their mental faculties may have diminished mental capacity or merely dulled mental capacity. This is a fact recognized by modern criminal codes and medical experts in various countries. This law deems the acts of those who have completely lost their mental faculties as acts of the insane and does not punish them. However, it would be contrary to the intent of the law to punish those with less severe</p>
<p>mental dullness the same</p>
<p>as those with sound minds. Therefore, this law does not impose the usual punishment for the acts of those with diminished mental capacity, nor does it completely absolve them of criminal responsibility, but stipulates that the punishment can be reduced. The intent is very clear. Furthermore, foreign criminal codes have many similar provisions, such as the criminal codes of Italy, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, etc., which list provisions for diminished mental capacity. The International Criminal Law Conference of 1905 also passed a resolution that those with diminished mental capacity who commit crimes should be subject to lighter punishments. The</p>
<p>usual behavior</p>
<p>of the appellants showed no evil habits. The motive for the murder was not to seize property. The reason they ultimately committed such a grave mistake was partly due to their congenital diminished mental capacity and partly due to the failure of education to correct it. Regarding the former, it can be seen from both the paternal and maternal sides of the appellants. Investigating the paternal side reveals that the victim served at the Commercial Press around 1918 and 1919 for more than a year. He had a cold and stern appearance, eccentric behavior, and rarely interacted with colleagues (lawyer Yu Hualong can testify, having worked with him). His daughter, Qin Zhu (i.e., the appellants' sister), also testified to her father's character (the school authorities can testify). During the case, she even</p>
<p>suffered a nervous breakdown, as lawyer Chen Ming of the police force stated on record. Furthermore, according to investigations, the victim's ancestors suffered from severe tuberculosis, which has a medically recognized connection to mental disorders (refer to page 15 of "Criminal Psychology" from the Judicial Administration Department's Judge Training Institute). Investigating the maternal side reveals that her aunt (i.e., Zhou Jing's sister) also had long-standing dementia, which was known to relatives and friends. Based on this, it is not difficult to imagine that many relatives of the victim's family suffered from mental illnesses such as diminished mental capacity. However, this falls within the scope of forensic medicine. Whether the appellants actually had</p>
<p>this condition</p>
<p>should be thoroughly investigated and assessed by specialized medical experts before a conclusion can be reached (refer to Supreme Court Ruling No. 306, Shang Zi, of the 17th year). The original trial completely disregarded this major factor in the crime, succumbing to ethical concepts and social opinion, and hastily pronounced the verdict, failing to fulfill the duties of investigation. Regarding the latter issue of education, the aforementioned mental illnesses can be divided into loss of mind and diminished mental capacity. The former refers to damage to the nervous system, while the latter only refers to</p>
<p>abnormal psychology. There</p>
<p>may not be damage to the nervous system. People with this type of illness are mostly physically weak and mentally exhausted. Their nervous system only has one fixed idea, and it often cannot mutually restrain the rational concepts that form the background of their entire personality. In other words, these people are often isolated from society and only know themselves, not others. Whether their usual will and behavior are compatible with social life is often irrelevant. They only know that those who give birth to them are friends and</p>
<p>those who harm them are enemies. Those with sound physical and mental development can control their daily will and behavior and adapt to social life. Those with unsound physical and mental development are like moths drawn to a flame, often unable to control themselves and becoming slaves to emotional impulses. The only way to correct this type of physical and mental illness is through education. Education can change temperament and correct such patients, sacrificing lesser and more immediate desires to achieve greater and more distant happiness. Whether the appellants have a strong</p>
<p>hereditary connection</p>
<p>to congenital diminished mental capacity remains to be determined. However, observing the appellants' (1) physical weakness, (2) isolated lives, and (3) withdrawn demeanor reveals ample evidence of their mental impairment. Furthermore, the correction of education relies on the complementary efforts of family and school education. Regarding the former, although our country has based its foundations on filial piety for thousands of years, Confucian ethical concepts do not refer to one-sided obligations. This can be seen in Mencius's words: "If the prince regards his ministers as dirt, the ministers will regard the prince as an enemy," and "Kindness is sufficient to protect the four seas, but without extending kindness, one cannot even protect his wife and children." Kindness and filial piety, though different in name, are both</p>
<p>of the same nature. Both</p>
<p>are relative terms. If the father is kind, the son can also be filial. The son's lack of filial piety stems from the father's lack of kindness. Therefore, if the father is unkind, the son may not be filial. "As you sow, so shall you reap." In the family where the appellants lived, they were treated as strangers due to the victim's abuse and coldness. Over time, this destroyed their natural affection. Not only could it not correct the appellants' psychological abnormalities, but it also allowed resentment to continue to grow. The appellants did not hesitate to eliminate the obstacles to their family's happiness by any means possible when they were mentally impaired. Tracing the cause, it was their relentless pursuit of joy, unrestrained by reason. As for</p>
<p>school education,</p>
<p>apart from academics, it often avoids discussing ethical issues, leading to a lack of proper understanding of right and wrong, obedience and defiance. Their naturally cold and withdrawn personalities, combined with the lack of close teachers and friends who could guide and correct them and change their temperament, made their personalities like frozen ice, hidden in an ice cellar, with no chance of melting. This ultimately led to this shocking tragedy. In other words, the appellants' criminal behavior should also be partly attributed to the responsibility of family and school education. Although the appellants' crimes are unforgivable, according to the above explanation, they are truly</p>
<p>victims of a feudal family. Moreover, the motive for the crime was not to seize property, and the purpose of the crime was to save their mother. Therefore, according to the standards for determining the severity of punishment in Article 57 of the Criminal Law, even if the appellants' mental health were determined to be sound, there would be no need to impose the ultimate penalty. Based on the above discussion, the original trial did not assess their mental abnormalities or ask whether their circumstances could be excused, and yet imposed the sole death penalty, which is inappropriate. This is unconvincing.</p>
<p>Issue of Accessory</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the part of the appeal concerning the appellant Zhou Jing assisting in the desecration of the body (hereinafter referred to as the appellant), according to criminal law, an accessory must have knowledge of the principal offender's criminal act and provide assistance. This is already established in Supreme Court Ruling No. 39, Shang Zi, of the 21st year. The appellant in this case had no prior knowledge of her sons desecrating the body, nor was she present at the time. Therefore, she should not be rashly convicted. As for the statements made by Zhou Qinji et al., which are unfavorable to themselves, as recorded in the</p>
<p>trial record,</p>
<p>Zhou Qinji answered, "My brother frequently went to my mother's room to inform her of everything. Afterwards, my mother went to my father's room, and my brother and I proposed how to dispose of the body," which not only cannot be used as evidence of the appellant's assistance but also serves to refute that, at the time of the premeditation, the appellant was visiting the body and did not participate in the plan, which is self-evident. Furthermore, observing Zhou Qinji's statement, "We brothers went to the room to discuss how to deal with the body, but without result," it is even more evident that even if the appellant was present, it was her sons Zhou Qinji et al. who participated in the discussion, and the matter discussed was only how to dispose of the body, without mentioning the plan to dismember it.</p>
<p>The term "dispose of the body"</p>
<p>does not necessarily refer to dismemberment. Interment is also a method of disposing of the body. This is the natural interpretation according to the tone. Even if her sons mentioned desecrating the body at that time, since there was no result of the discussion, it is clear that she had no knowledge of her sons' dismembering the body. How can it be presumed that she expressed agreement and provided assistance? Furthermore, how could she necessarily have seen or heard anything when the appellant was in a state of grief, fear, and diminished mental capacity? The original trial's assumption that the appellant was present and must have been consulted clearly shows conjecture and speculation. Conspiracy requires active behavior. Since the appellant did not join in the</p>
<p>deliberation of her sons</p>
<p>nor express any verbal support, the original trial's considering mere silence as active assistance is also contrary to the principles of criminal law regarding accessories. Furthermore, the appellant went downstairs at dawn (refer to the trial record). When she went downstairs, her sons had already left. Regarding everything that happened after they returned home and went upstairs, since the appellant did not go upstairs with them, there is no question of her knowing about it, let alone assisting. The original trial's claim that the appellant stayed downstairs in the kitchen to restrain the maid is also a hollow speculation. The purpose of surveillance is to prevent outsiders from</p>
<p>knowing and shouting. However, whether there was a need for outsiders to go upstairs at the time and whether the appellant prevented it was not investigated in the original trial, which is also inappropriate. As for the key, it may have been given temporarily by her sons after the incident. The appellant did not know the reason at the time. How can the appellant's failure to report the incident after the fact be used as a reason to pronounce judgment on a crime? Moreover, as a mother, how could she bear to do so again? One is moved by things, and there is no compensation for the loss of a husband. This is also what is unavoidable due to the great love of a mother. This is unconvincing.</p>
<p>Seeking Life from Death</p>
<p>In summary, the appellants are young and their will is unstable. Their minds are impaired, and education has provided little correction. They only relied on their stubborn and simplistic ideas, risking the crime of great impiety. They could not correct their father's misconduct, nor could they bear to watch their mother die. Their father had already destroyed his natural affection. With you, we have you. Without you, we have nothing. Furthermore, their mother may have been abused to death by their father. They feared that they might become motherless. Therefore, the appellants believed that if you are there, the mother will be saved. Judging the situation, the appellants'</p>
<p>criminal behavior</p>
<p>was not out of intent or malice. This is what Sima Qian meant when he said, "A minister kills his ruler, a son kills his father, not because of something that happened overnight, but because they all thought he was unaware of their plans." Furthermore, during times of intense warfare, it is easier to provoke those with diminished mental capacity. They often consider death to be commonplace. Western philosopher Nietzsche also believed that "war can cultivate the psychology of not adopting human methods and applying them." Therefore, the appellants are not only victims of a feudal society but also victims of the war era.</p>
<p>How can they not be pitied?</p>
<p>Defense counsel is in dispute. The reason why this shocking case of incest is discussed repeatedly is also due to Ouyang Xiu's father's belief in "seeking life from death," hoping to discover something within the bounds of law and reason. Otherwise, in this extraordinary time, the appellants have committed a shocking case of incest. According to the country's laws and regulations and societal morals, all those who uphold morality and ethics say that they deserve to be killed and that even killing them is not enough to cover their guilt. Why is the defense counsel willing to stand alone against the public and be condemned by society? The lawyer also believes that there is a clause that states, "There is reason to be lenient; the crime should be hidden." Based on the above statement,</p>
<p>we earnestly request a review</p>
<p>and a swift change to the original judgment, to grant leniency to the death sentences of the appellants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, and to declare the appellant Zhou Jing innocent, which would be fair. After receiving the petition, the Second Branch of the High Court will open a trial soon. At that time, the area next to the Second Branch of the High Court on Weihaiwei Road will be crowded with people and there will be no empty seats.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the brief news item in your newspaper on the 16th of this month, which stated that the total amount of donations presented to Mr. Wang Qinda's anniversary memorial ceremony was over 3,000 yuan, which has been entirely allocated by Mr. Wang's family as donations for winter clothing for refugees to the Cilian Relief Association, we have found that the total amount of money donated by various sectors for the refugee winter clothing funds in memory of Mr. Wang Qinda's anniversary is 1,296 yuan, which is inconsistent with the number reported. I am writing to you to provide the specifics and ask you to check the facts and include a correction in the letter column.</p>

<h3>Who Says China Has No Inventors?</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>It goes without saying that China is lagging behind in science. However, we must not despise the glorious facts of history, which can also inspire us to catch up quickly. Many important things in foreign countries today were invented in China in the past. For example, the compass, which is indispensable in the shipping industry today, was invented by the Yellow Emperor thousands of years ago. The invention of printing technology was also earliest in our country. During the Five Dynasties period, Feng Dao invented woodblock printing. In the Song Dynasty, Bi Sheng invented movable type printing, and in the Ming Dynasty, Hua Sui and An Guo created copper movable type printing. Other things we use daily, such as porcelain, and weapons used in warfare, such as gunpowder, were all invented by the Chinese.</p>
<p>In recent years, the interest of Chinese people in scientific research has also become increasingly strong, and there have been many new inventions. Who says China has no inventors? Now, let us list fifteen people as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhong Ling invented the Zhong-style printing machine and pressure oil lamp. (2) Tang Zhongming invented the charcoal car. (3) Shu Zhendong invented the Chinese typewriter. (4) Qiu Bo'an invented multi-filament electric bulbs. (5) Wang Bonian, a water line engineer at the Yantai Telegraph Bureau, invented the Chinese telegraph machine. (6) Wang Zhenshan, a Chinese overseas Chinese in Singapore, invented the fuel injection engine car. (7) Si Tongzhen, of Jiang Shi Middle School in Fugou, Henan, invented a new-style waterwheel. (8) Feng Yongkang, of Yuxi, Yunnan, invented a silk weaving machine. (9) Sui Shaobo, of Beiping, invented the cotton comber. (10) Xiang Hui'an, of the China Black and White Society, invented a magnesium flashbulb camera capable of 1/1000 of a second. (11) Zhang Mingyi, an engineer on the Qingdao-Jinan Railway, used steel powder waste to make pig iron. (12) Ji Zhenggang, of Shaanxi, invented a new-style lever pedal for cotton ginning. (13) Qian Linzhao, the head of the Physics Research Institute of the National Research Institute of Beiping, invented the voltage crystal. (14) Zheng Miaoqing, of Hangzhou, invented fireproof cloth. (15) Huang Chao, a student studying abroad, invented bamboo gunpowder in Germany.</p>
<p>Smart children! Inventors are not extraordinary superhumans, nor is invention only for superhumans. As long as you can pay attention to observation, carry out precise experiments, and be patient and strong, you will surely succeed. Work hard! Success is waiting for you!</p>
<h3>We Should Have the Habit of Getting Up Early</h3>
<p>— Fenfei</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder and colder, and you must be reluctant to leave your warm beds, but on the road, we often see foreign children, wearing very thin clothes, with their legs exposed, with their chests out and their backpacks on their backs, marching toward school with great energy! Looking back at our children, they are like little old men, wearing very thick clothes, moving slowly, and lacking any "vitality." What is the reason for this? I dare say that this is clear evidence of unsound physical condition. On the one hand, it is the unsoundness of the parents and the lack of innate qualities; on the other hand, it is the lack of attention to the importance of physical education and strict training.</p>
<p>The howling north wind outside is blowing hard, and it's still early? I'll get up in a while! Indeed, lying in a warm bed, everyone feels comfortable. However, time flies by, second by second, minute by minute, it just runs forward, and the clock on the wall goes "Dang! Dang!..." striking six! Part of your brain is telling you that now is the time to get up! Don't sleep anymore! If you don't get up, you'll be "late" again! Min'er finally struggled to get up, put on her clothes, ate her morning porridge, and walked to the street with her backpack on her back to fight the roaring north wind! Children, do you have the spirit of fighting? I hope you are not afraid of the cold, and quickly develop the habit of "getting up early," which can not only exercise your body but also use the morning time to review your homework, so why not do it? Look! Foreign children, are they afraid of the cold? The reason why they can resist the severe cold of winter is nothing more than the relationship between the strength and weakness of their bodies. If you have a healthy body, of course, you can resist the cold. A healthy body requires daily exercise, and winter is the best time for us to exercise.</p>
<p>Fathers and brothers! You must not spoil your children. You must know that the only way to exercise your body is at this time. Look, most of the children from Jiangbei everywhere are barefoot, but I have never seen them get "frostbite." At the same time, I have never seen them get "heat boils" in the summer. Isn't this evidence of exercise? I have never seen them "get sick" from the cold, so we must be like the children of Jiangbei, fighting against the cold! So that our weak bodies can be trained into strong bodies, and in winter, we must have the habit of "getting up early." Someone said it well: "Get up early, be healthy." That's really right!</p>
<h3>Small Science</h3>
<p>— Cikai</p>
<p>Pour sifted, dried fine sand from a funnel. After a while, a round, conical sand tower will form underneath. After this sand tower reaches a certain height, the sand that falls down will slide down from the sides of the tower, and the area occupied by the tower will gradually expand. Therefore, we can never build a tall, pointed sand tower.</p>
<p>Scientists tell us that the slope of a sand tower cannot exceed thirty degrees. (Thirty degrees is as large as one-third of a square table corner.)</p>

<h3>New Year's Gamble – Memoirs of Seeking Refuge, Part 43 –</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>The villagers were doing their best to enjoy the games they wanted to play during this short New Year's period. However, in such a remote village, besides a few dilapidated grocery stores, there was simply not a single teahouse or restaurant, let alone any theaters or game halls. Villagers who had grown up there and never left probably hadn't even dreamed of such things. So, what did they do for fun during the New Year? What exactly was there to spice up the New Year? Apart from the occasional firecracker, the new peach wood charms on the doors, and the new clothes on people, the sounds of dice and bamboo tiles became their only New Year decorations and their only form of entertainment.</p>
<p>In front of the ancestral hall, on the open square, many adults and children gathered around all sorts of small stalls, which was a special New Year scene. The crowd over there was exceptionally lively, bustling with activity. The sounds of talking, laughing... filled the air around it, as if a large swarm of bees were buzzing loudly. The stalls were all run by families in the village who were quite wealthy. Seeing this once-a-year opportunity, they came up with these new ideas, hoping to make an easy profit during the New Year. With a small investment, they bought some colorful candies, scrubbed a table clean, covered it with clean and bright five-colored paper, and came up with things like spinning wheels, lotteries, and raffles... In short, these were all things that children liked and that suited their psychology, because these games allowed them to get a lot of candy for a small amount of money. Who wouldn't be happy to do that? Those ignorant children were drawn in and couldn't leave, clustering around the stalls like a swarm of bees attracted to sweet flowers. They kept asking their parents for money, but the money was always lost before they even tasted the candy. Therefore, there were often some cries mixed in with the laughter and talking, creating a discordant musical trio.</p>
<p>Further on, there was the adults' New Year club: many tables lined up along a dead-end road. People were also gathered in small groups around the tables. The tables were covered with white tablecloths, and a neatly dressed person sat there dealing the tiles. People standing around placed their banknotes and small coins as bets. Then, two dice were thrown, and the tiles were quickly separated and turned over. The dealer "ate" or "matched" the banknotes on the table. They were playing Pai Gow, and the stakes seemed particularly high, because the tabletop was covered with small coins and banknotes. Further on, a group of people were making a racket of dice and bowls clashing, playing "Old Crow".</p>
<p>Ming'er was very excited as he strolled around, looking at everything. He stood watching the dice game for quite a while, seeing someone who had already won a large pile of banknotes still standing there, refusing to leave, putting all his banknotes on the table. The dealer had almost lost everything. Seeing that he was still betting, he stood up and threw the dice very forcefully, with an ugly and indescribable expression on his face. As he threw the dice, he shouted in a sharp tone, hoping to "eat" the banknotes, while the person betting shouted insults. The two of them were fighting for money, and the situation was quite tense. This was a crucial moment. If the dealer won, he could not only break even but also make money. The person betting had worked hard and won so much money, but he was still not satisfied and made this all-or-nothing bet, hoping to get double the money. Both of them had a strong ambition. Therefore, the six dice were spinning at the bottom of the bowl, their movement being greatly related to their gains and losses. Their pairs of eyes were staring sharply into the bowl, but their minds were completely different. This was an ugly scene of people becoming ferocious for money. Money! Money! It's really a good thing! But also a bad thing!</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf (9)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Ah Li hastily said, "I'm sorry, I – I really don't know." The dwarves also said in unison, "Yes, we don't know either." Ah Li smiled slightly and said, "Do you mean you don't know my name? Then let me tell you first, my name is Ah Li!" The dwarves continued to stare blankly as if they hadn't heard. Ah Li then repeated, "My name is Ah Li!"</p>
<p>The dwarves replied, "Ah Li, Ah Li, what a good name! Just call us Blue. We've all come here together to invite you to our village for supper. After you've eaten, you'll know that our cooking is not bad either!" Seeing them so polite, Ah Li said uneasily, "Thank you for your kindness. If the road isn't far, I'll definitely come along, but I'm afraid I won't be able to eat much. To be honest, I don't feel hungry." As she spoke, she took a piece of bread from her bag and said, "Besides, I have bread here. I couldn't finish it when I had coffee earlier, so I brought it with me."</p>
<p>Immediately, several dwarves came closer, carefully examining the piece of bread. They reached out and stroked it, and then sniffed it. One of the dwarves even stuck out his tongue and licked it. His eyes widened, showing a surprised expression, and he looked at Ah Li and said, "This thing isn't good." Ah Li quickly said, "But I don't think there's anything wrong with it. This is country bread. If you lived in that village over there, you'd have to eat this too."</p>
<p>The two dwarves didn't pay attention to Ah Li's words, but turned around and shouted sharply, "Come here, everyone!" The other dwarves responded in unison, their voices equally sharp. Ah Li was surprised to see them all coming. But the dwarf on the bucket didn't jump down, still coming over on the bucket. The one bending his knees also continued to bend his knees as he came over. Even the one doing somersaults still did somersaults as he came over. In an instant, all the dwarves had gathered at her feet.</p>
<p>Ah Li looked up and suddenly saw a large robe hanging from a tree in front of her, looking very much like her aunt's traveling coat, but the color was the same light blue as the dwarves' clothes. Ah Li understood that this robe was especially for her to wear. She stood up, reached out, took the robe, and put it on. She happily muttered to herself, "Now I'll definitely be able to experience some new and interesting things."</p>
<p>Then the dwarves started to move forward—no, you can't say they were moving forward, you can only say they were wriggling forward. Ah Li was in the middle of them, letting them crowd around her as they went forward. The blue robe she wore was blowing in the wind, looking particularly beautiful. Everyone just hurried on their way, without saying a word. The sky was getting dark, and the forest was even darker, but Ah Li wasn't surprised. They walked for a while, and finally saw a small point of bright blue light flickering ahead. This blue light seemed to be no bigger than a firefly, but it was particularly bright and sparkling in the darkness. As soon as the dwarves saw this blue light, they shouted, and as soon as the shout stopped, they began to sing. What do you think they were singing? Ah Li didn't believe it at first, but after listening carefully, she was absolutely certain that they were singing the famous English song "Home, Sweet Home." The strangest thing was that they sang it beautifully, and it sounded exactly like her aunt's voice.</p>

<h3>Regarding the "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School"</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>It has been reported in the previous newspaper that the Refugee Relief Association will hold a charity performance for four days starting on the 27th of this month, and will hold an "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School" for one day based on my suggestion. Yesterday (the 17th) at 4 p.m., the officials in charge of the Refugee Relief Association, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, specifically hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant to invite performers from both the amateur and professional circles to finalize the schedule and program, as follows:</p>
<p>November 27th, Day Performance: Comic Suzhou Ballad Singing, Kunqu Opera All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Famous Performers All-Star Gathering</p>
<p>28th, Day Performance: Shanghai Opera All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Amateur Performers All-Star Gathering</p>
<p>29th, Day Performance: Spoken Drama All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Movie Stars All-Star Gathering</p>
<p>30th, Day Performance: Famous Performers All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Amateur Performers All-Star Gathering</p>
<p>In the above program, the Famous Performers All-Star Gathering on the evening of the 27th is a completely new stage performance, led by Wu Suqiu. The Famous Performers All-Star Gathering on the day performance of the 30th was originally planned to be an "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School." However, after discussion, it was decided that the "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School" was limited to the Kylin School, which was a narrower scope. It would be better to hold a joint performance by actors from various theaters, which would be more lively. Therefore, the Famous Performers All-Star Gathering on the day performance of the 30th was changed to a joint performance. The program has already been scheduled, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Yuan Xiaolou, Wang Shaolou, Li Zhonglin, Liu Hanchen, Gao Xueqiao</p>
<p>Huang Baoyan, Lu Maobao, Xu Yunting, Wang Fuying, Wang Guiqing</p>
<p>The Three Iron Roosters</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Xue Youqin, Wang Xichun, Zhang Shuxian, Mao Jianqiu</p>
<p>Zhang Shulan, Xin Suwen, Yu Sulian, Li Xuefang</p>
<p>Eight Performances of Five Caves of Flowers</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan (Guan Yu), Zhou Xinfang (Huang Zhong), Liu Kunrong (Wei Yan)</p>
<p>Battle of Changsha</p>
<p>The above program has been decided after much consideration and is unlikely to change again. However, based on the above program, there are two major shortcomings: (1) The time is only 13 quarters of an hour. In the past, the regulations for joint performances were to perform for six hours, which is a large difference; (2) The finale, "Battle of Changsha," although it is currently a popular play, was previously performed by Yuan Shihai as Wei Yan at Yu's house. The popularity of this play lies in the equal skill of the three performers. Now, replacing Yuan Shihai with Liu Kunrong is a difference that cannot be justified. It can be determined that the performance of this play will not be as good as the previous performance by Zhou, Zhao, and Yuan.</p>
<p>As for the so-called All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School, it is expected that it will be able to attract attention and generate interest. Therefore, it has been decided to hold it, but the four-day charity performance will not be performed for the time being. It has been decided to hold a public performance at the Tianchan Theater on the 7th of next month. The program is roughly the same as what was proposed in this publication on September 1st, but Zhao Ruquan, Zhao Songqiao, Wang Chunbai, and others will be added, and the name will be changed to "All-Star Gathering of Civil and Military Senior Actors." The two Zhaos and one Wang will jointly perform the play "Gaoping Pass," and at the same time, famous amateurs Sun Lanting, Zhang Zhongyuan, and Qi Jun and others will guest star in a Kylin School play. Although it is called "All-Star Gathering of Civil and Military Senior Actors," it is actually based on the "Kylin School Gathering." It is expected that the public performance will be a sensation in the theater world.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on "Golden Jade Filled Hall" - Grand Opening Premiere at the Dahua Theater</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>"Golden Jade Filled Hall" is the first film to premiere at the Dahua Theater and is also the first collaboration between child stars Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.</p>
<p>They both have very brilliant performances in this film. Especially Mickey Rooney's acting skills, he not only maintains his superb performance in "Children's Paradise," but also shows off his never-before-seen stunts. He plays the piano skillfully and fluently, singing while playing, fully demonstrating his musical literacy. In addition, he blackened his face and sang passionately, which is not inferior to Eddie Cantor's singing. The most amazing thing is that he imitates Clark Gable's and Lionel Barrymore's tone and expression, "a perfect likeness." The main show of his performance can be said to be the highest record of Mickey Rooney's films.</p>
<p>Judy Garland's singing has always been on par with Deanna Durbin. Her tone has a sweet and intoxicating magic, and her dance steps have a fascinating heat. Her performance in "Golden Jade Filled Hall" is a perfect match with Mickey Rooney, like a red peony and green leaves, complementing each other. All the actors involved in the supporting cast are minor boys and girls. The performance is very lively and humorous, making people smile from beginning to end.</p>
<p>All American film publications unanimously recommend this film as a rare singing film in recent years. The Dahua Theater adopted it as the opening film, which shows its importance.</p>
<h3>Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland Co-Star in "Golden Jade Filled Hall"... Two Little Ones Without Guessing</h3>
<h3>Thoughts on "The Miser"</h3>
<p>— Bing Jiu</p>
<p>Shortly after the performance of "Before Sunrise," the Baolian Drama Troupe staged the world-famous "The Miser" at the Carlton on Sunday morning of last week. The script was adapted by Gu Zhongyi from Molière's "The Miser." The whole play is full of humorous and satirical atmosphere. First of all, we cannot praise too much Director Wu Ming's handling of the scenes. Each act can grasp the audience's tense emotions and infuse them with a painful tone, which is realized from laughter. However, due to the difficulty of controlling the characters, some scenes are not as satisfactory as expected. In terms of performance, Yan Yan's Hua Binggang is quite successful, but his movements seem not very calm. Zhang Yongqing's Mingxi is also very good, but the last scene is not performed realistically enough. Han Yan's Chuan Niangzi is too artificial and unnatural. Liao Jiaai's Hua Ying is too dull. Tong Hua's Zhang Asi is very experienced in acting, and his inner performance is also profound. Although he is too hard-working, he is inevitably a little too much like a civilized drama. Other lighting, scenery, and makeup are all kept as simple as possible. Under the principle of "only seeking no mistakes," it may not be a smart approach.</p>

<p>International Situation</p>
<h3>Possible Evolution of the Western Front of the European War</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>Hitler May Adopt a Surprising Blitzkrieg Tactics - This Depends on Whether German Aircraft Overwhelms the British and French Forces</p>
<p>Hitler is hovering between war and peace.</p>
<p>Although neutral countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium have called for peace, both Britain and France have stated that there is no possibility of peaceful coexistence unless the Nazis change their policy of aggression. In this situation, in order to win the war and prevent the collapse of the German National Socialist Party's regime, Hitler must break the long-term encirclement policy in order to resolve the war quickly.</p>
<p>Air Combat Strength</p>
<p>In the war against Poland, within twenty days, the German army defeated the Polish army like a swift wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The reason for the success of the German blitzkrieg tactics was that its air force was far superior to that of Poland. Germany had as many as 3,000 first-class aircraft in the war against Poland, while Poland only had 360 aircraft. Because Hitler had such air superiority, he destroyed the Polish air force base in one fell swoop, achieving the goal of a quick victory. However, the situation in the war against France is completely different from that in the war against Poland. Although Germany is stronger than the total number of British and French aircraft in terms of fighter jets, fighter jets can be shot down by fighter escorts. Britain and France have the advantage in this regard. In addition to their own production, a large part of the fighter escorts in the British and French air forces are purchased from the United States. The American Curtiss factory supplied a large number of fighter escorts to Britain and France. After the amendment of the new American neutrality law, Britain and France will inevitably be in a more advantageous position than Germany in terms of the import of American aircraft and military supplies in the future, due to their superiority in sea and air transport compared to Germany, their stronger financial resources, and the United States' sympathy for Britain and France. There is no doubt that this will be a greater blow to Germany.</p>
<p>In this air war in Western Europe, according to the official statistics of Britain and France, the loss of British and French fighter escorts was eight, while the loss of Germany was twenty-four. That is a ratio of one to three. The loss of bombers is greater for Britain and France. This is because Britain and France wanted to bomb Germany's heavily defended military centers. On the other hand, if German aircraft make the same attempt to bomb British and French military centers, their losses will inevitably be equal.</p>
<p>Comparison of Tanks on Both Sides</p>
<p>In addition to the air force, Germany's other weapon is mechanized units. Because of the development of its heavy industry, Germany's tank production is extremely rapid, and its number may exceed that of Britain and France. However, French tanks are superior to German tanks. French tanks are lighter and faster. The outside of the 11-ton, 20-ton, and 28-ton tanks is covered with special steel armor, which is almost impenetrable by artillery. This is a secret manufacturing by the British and French, which cannot be imitated by the Germans.</p>
<p>Germany's Possible Military Strategies</p>
<p>Since France has such superior air and land war weapons, plus the impregnable Maginot Line for defense, in order to wage a protracted war, it is impossible for Germany to take the offensive from the Western Front to annihilate the British and French forces and achieve an overwhelming victory in fact. If Germany resorts to a surprise attack, bypasses the rear of France, and defeats the British and French Allied forces, then it must pass through the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland. Germany has concentrated its troops on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium, which was once a hot topic. When necessary, Germany may act without regard to everything. At that time, more countries will be involved in the war, and the scope of the war will inevitably become wider.</p>

<h3>Old Mrs. Zhao</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>...The Mother of the Jinan Team Praised by Outsiders...</p>
<p>Female heroes in ancient China are countless in history, but it is rare for an illiterate woman, already fifty-eight years old, to lead her more than thirty children and grandchildren to resist foreign aggression. Such a "whole family resisting the war" is really worth advocating and imitating at the moment. Therefore, the reason why Old Mrs. Zhao is called the mother of the guerrillas and is warmly welcomed everywhere shows that it is not blind worship, nor is it accidental.</p>
<p>The photo of Old Mrs. Zhao below is published in this year's American publication, Asia Magazine. Its description is "Old Mrs. Zhao, who is called the mother of the guerrillas, has given speeches to encourage the Chinese people no less than a thousand times, and has raised tens of thousands of yuan for the guerrillas. She is an illiterate peasant woman who encouraged farmers to resist Japan in her former hometown, a village in Manchuria, and fought with the guerrillas, and has not stopped until now. Her son, Zhao Tong, organized an army of about 20,000 people to fight in Hebei after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. This army has close ties with the Eighth Route Army, and its officers are almost all trained by the Eighth Route Army." It can be seen that outsiders also pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The old lady's name is Zhao Hongguowen. Since February of the 21st year of the Republic of China, she has donated her family property to the Volunteer Army, and the whole family has joined the work. She personally founded more than 30,000 North China guerrillas, who fought in various provinces in Northeast and North China, from the Changbai Mountains to the Taihang Mountains. Although she is old, she is energetic and her voice is as loud as a bell. In February of this year, she took a plane to Chongqing, and many people welcomed her at the airport.</p>
<p>When she was in Kunming, the Provincial Party Department held a meeting to welcome her. She attended and gave a speech, with more than 5,000 listeners. She told reporters in Kunming: "I don't want to be a mother of a family, I want to be a mother of the masses. I send my children and grandchildren to the guerrillas. I think every mother should send her children to the front line to fight with the enemy, and every mother should also join the front line."</p>
<p>The ancients have a saying: "Strong grass is known in a strong wind, and heroes emerge in troubled times." At this time of national crisis, not only male national heroes are emerging, but also female national heroes are rising up. This is also the inevitable law of cause and effect.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Will</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>Recently, in the East End of London, there has been a batch of novel newspaper sellers, shouting in their mouths: "Do you want to see Hitler's will and last words!"</p>
<p>If you spend a few pence, you can buy a copy, which begins: "The painter Hitler, who led Germany astray, the famous madman of Europe ×" Fearing an accident, a will is prepared in advance, and so on. The following are a few sections of the will:</p>
<p>"All the German people who trust me give to the mute government. (Meaning that in an all-powerful country, everyone except the dictator is mute. Translator)"</p>
<p>"All my medals are given to Goering. The weight of the medals, including himself, will make him kneel down."</p>
<p>"My Struggle" is given to Aseren, please review it again." (This is probably because there are many places in the book that scold the Soviet Union! Translator)"</p>
<p>"My beard is given to Chaplin, because this thing is grown in imitation of him."</p>
<p>"My will should be executed by Ribbentrop and Goering, because they have the experience to execute it."</p>
<p>Finally, he needs to be embalmed in a fireproof asbestos coffin. After the burial, the German Parliament should declare that "Hell" is incorporated into the German territory. He said: "Hell, I have tried many ways to give it to the German people, and it should rightfully belong to the motherland."</p>
<p>Economic Knowledge</p>
<h3>Internal Exchange Management</h3>
<p>— Si Xing</p>
<p>The economic development of our country has always been extremely unbalanced, with most of the capital concentrated in a few important coastal cities. Of this capital, very little is actually engaged in national industry; most is colluding with foreign capital, forming the so-called comprador capital. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to disperse funds and build up the rear, the government has provided great encouragement and assistance for the internal transfer of funds and industry. A considerable number of industrialists with foresight have moved their factories inland. However, a significant number remain who are content with the status quo, seeking refuge in the concessions, and reorganizing their old businesses. Furthermore, the arrival of refugees from various places in Shanghai, bringing with them large amounts of capital, has created an unprecedented and peculiar prosperity in Shanghai, as well as a huge trade deficit. This phenomenon is obviously abnormal and unreasonable. Recently, the government has deeply realized that this situation should not be allowed to continue, and has ordered the four banks - Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China - to form a Domestic Exchange Management Committee to implement internal exchange controls. The committee is located at the headquarters of the four banks in Chongqing, with branches established throughout the country, attached to the four banks. Regulations stipulate that remittances from the interior to occupied coastal areas such as Shanghai and Tianjin are limited to the purchase of necessities, and must be applied for to the Exchange Management Committee, providing supporting documents showing the purpose, amount, destination, and merchant details. However, remittances from Shanghai to the interior are granted various conveniences. Remittances to any location in the interior are exempt from remittance fees, and when Shanghai makes remittances, the interior can still receive the full amount in cash. This internal exchange management method is undoubtedly an effective and reasonable measure aimed at the current abnormal situation.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of internal exchange management, funds from the interior rushed to escape to Shanghai. Statistics show that remittances from Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and other places to Shanghai constantly exceeded 100,000 yuan per day. The government had no overall solution to this, and only showed slight restraint in a passive manner, such as changing the payment of government bond interest to Chongqing in cash, and Shanghai paying discounted drafts in installments. Since the implementation of management, remittances from the interior to Shanghai have become much more difficult. The previous regulation of 1,000 yuan per person per day has now been reduced to a maximum of 100 yuan, and post offices can only remit 50 yuan. Regarding exchange rates, remittances from Yunnan and Chongqing to Shanghai require 1,400 or 1,500 yuan in local cash to obtain a 1,000 yuan draft in Shanghai. If cash is required, an even greater premium is needed. Therefore, the daily amount of remittances from the interior to Shanghai has now been reduced to between 20,000 yuan. On the other hand, remittances from Shanghai to the interior have surged since the implementation of internal exchange management. Not only are remittance fees waived, but there is also a premium. Ordinary remittances to Kunming, Chongqing, and other places only require 70 to 80 yuan in Shanghai for every 100 yuan remitted.</p>
<p>The purpose of internal exchange management is twofold: negatively, it is to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior, preventing them from falling into enemy hands; positively, it is to encourage the internal transfer of funds from Shanghai, for national use. As for the decline of Shanghai's prosperity, its signs are now gradually emerging. Those who possess capital should take this opportunity to open up our new world in the southwest and northwest.</p>
<h3>A Deaf Person Cannot Hear the Alarm</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Europe, London, England, has been constantly attacked by the German air force. Although the air defense equipment is very complete, people still have to take temporary shelter in air raid shelters when alarms sound. A couple among the residents are both deaf and often cannot hear the alarm at night, which is quite distressing. They wrote to the question-and-answer column of a magazine for a solution. The reply stated: There is no other way but to ask the neighbors to notify them. This is also a regret for those with incomplete sensory organs.</p>
<h3>War and War Expenses</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The total military expenditure of the belligerent countries in the First World War amounted to 350 billion yuan. The war lasted for 1,665 days, with an average daily expenditure of 224 million yuan. Among them:</p>
<p>Britain: 71.9 billion yuan (accounting for 46% of national wealth)</p>
<p>France: 57 billion yuan (accounting for 55% of national wealth)</p>
<p>Germany: 66.6 billion yuan (accounting for 44% of national wealth)</p>
<p>United States: 46.1 billion yuan (accounting for 9% of national wealth)</p>
<p>Japan's war expenses for invading China have been increasing year by year. If the war continues to drag on, it will inevitably go bankrupt one day. Now, let's compare the war expenses of its previous foreign wars:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese War (1894): 25 million yuan</p>
<p>Russo-Japanese War (1904): 170 million yuan</p>
<p>Current Sino-Japanese War: 1.19 billion yuan</p>

<h3>Aspects of the Astrology Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Predicting Fortune and Misfortune Everywhere</p>
<p>When everyone is frustrated, the only hope is the shift in destiny, as so-called by fatalists, to have good luck and make a fortune. It can be said that people have the same heart and the same reason, so astrologers who predict fortune and misfortune are born in response to the times and flourish.</p>
<p>Ordinary astrologers mostly rent a house along the road, writing the words "So-and-so Fortune Telling Hall" or "So-and-so Establishes a Desk" at the door. Some even write some four-six essays as self-introductions, always using the phrases "Young, indulged in writing; old, fond of astrology; speaking of fortune and misfortune in the future, hitting the mark every time, like a precious raft in a maze, clearly indicating the direction; gentlemen who want to ask about their future, please come and try." Those who initially put up a sign often use the phrase "Visiting a friend but not meeting them, temporarily setting up a desk here." They advertise in the newspaper, adding a photo of themselves for publicity.</p>
<p>The Founders of the Astrology Industry</p>
<p>The books they read are probably no more than four types: the Ma Yi Physiognomy, the Liu Zhuang Physiognomy, the Divine Physiognomy Iron Sabre, and the Water Mirror Collection. It is said that Ma Yi was the teacher of Chen Tuan, Liu Zhuang was Yuan Zhongfu of the Ming Dynasty, the Divine Physiognomy Iron Sabre was written by an old monk called Yun Gu Shan Ren, and the Water Mirror Collection was written by Fan Wenyuan. These four books are complete with physiognomy for form, spirit, complexion, bone, flesh, moles, etc. However, there are obvious differences between men and women.</p>
<p>The Grades of the Astrology Industry</p>
<p>As for those who take a piece of chalk and draw a hand on the sidewalk next to the road, telling stories to make passers-by stop and watch, they randomly grab a spectator's hand, arbitrarily criticizing and predicting that person's fate. After finishing the story, they ask the person to take out five cents or a dime as a fortune-telling fee. This is also a common occurrence. It is said that these people are called itinerant fortune-tellers, and can be divided into four types: The first type is the so-called hanging a portrait. Wherever they go, they hang a half-length portrait of a square-faced, big-eared person on the wall. The old ones are portraits of a red-topped, feathered official, and the modern ones are dressed in suits. They can follow everything in the painting to guide people through their confusion. When they see a passerby, they say something like "Your Honor's Saturn is so prominent that you should have made a fortune long ago, but unfortunately the complexion on your face is not very good." When the passerby hears this tense tone, they immediately stop, and the business is successful. As for those astrologers who live in inns and reveal the portrait of a certain nobleman at the door, they are also a unique way of hanging a portrait.</p>
<p>The second type is called snatching a handkerchief, which means that these types of individuals do not have real skills but randomly grab someone passing by to tell their fortune based on their silver tongue to attract spectators to have a look at their hand for ten or twenty cents.</p>
<p>The third type is called bone-touching fortune-telling, which is a unique type of fortune-telling. They rely on the secrets of bone physiognomy in the Iron Sabre, and even illiterate people make a living by touching bones.</p>
<p>The fourth type is called hand-measuring fortune-telling, which is generally chosen in a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle. They carry a small copper ruler, a piece of coarse thread, and a cloth scroll with two or thirty hands drawn on it. By measuring the length of the fingers, they can determine your lifelong honor and disgrace. This is the simplest type of itinerant fortune-telling.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Kangding</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Kangding is the provincial capital of Xikang Province, located west of Luding Mountain, north of Mianning, east of Lihua, and south of Danba, in the southern section of the Daxue Mountains. The terrain protrudes from the plateau, which is more than 8,700 feet above sea level. The climate is cold all year round, the population is complex, and commerce is prosperous. It is the main hub for import and export trade in Xikang Province, and is also one of the important cities in several southwestern provinces of China.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the City of Kangding</p>
<p>Kangding is a place where Han, Tibetan, and Kang people live together, so it was impossible to unify until recently. Now it has been completely renewed. There are now two banks, one cinema, one Sichuan opera theater, and two or three slightly larger hotels and inns in the city, decorating the city. The busiest streets in the county town are Zhongshan Street and Zhongzheng Street. The two streets are located on the east and west banks of the city river, with three large wooden bridges connecting the traffic on both banks.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Xikang's Products</p>
<p>The climate is cold, and even in summer, you have to wear a coat, flannel vest, cotton jacket, and fur coat. The highest temperature in summer is 30 degrees Fahrenheit, and in winter it is 20 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Summer vegetables include radishes, fresh broad beans, peas, green beans, and second-crop beans. The only meat is beef and pork. However, the local people do not eat aquatic animals such as fish. Because after the local people die, they feed the fish with their bodies, which is called "water burial," a peculiar custom in Kangding. Therefore, the local people believe that "fish" is a sacred and inviolable animal.</p>
<p>Life is Quite Expensive</p>
<p>Kangding's cost of living is known as the highest in the country because transportation is inconvenient and difficult. Food and daily necessities all rely on manual carrying and import, and procurement must be done as far away as Chengdu, Kunming, and Ya'an. Therefore, prices are high, and in recent months, hundreds of residents have moved into Kangding from other provinces due to the war. Therefore, prices have soared, and life has become even more difficult. The prices of foreign goods and consumables on the market are seven or eight times more expensive than in Shanghai, and some are even more than ten times more expensive. However, local goods have also skyrocketed due to the sudden increase in population and the demand for everything exceeding supply. Even fresh pork costs 1.70 or 1.80 yuan per catty, flour costs more than 20 yuan per bag, rice costs more than 30 yuan per load, foreign candles cost 2.60 yuan per dozen, washbasins cost 4.60 yuan each (about 1 yuan in Shanghai), inferior socks cost 70 cents per pair (the most expensive in Shanghai costs about 20 cents), a bar of soap costs 30 cents, and morning tea biscuits cost nearly 2 yuan per pound, and vegetable oil costs 90 cents per catty. Therefore, a poor person like a porter or footman needs at least one yuan for daily living expenses, so the living expenses of a wealthy person are unbelievable!</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Xikang's Currency System</p>
<p>Kangding is the throat of trade in Xikang Province. Imports are dominated by tea, amounting to millions of yuan each year; exports include medicinal materials, wool, ox tails, musk, and food. All transactions are done in Tibetan silver dollars. Recently, the government issued an order throughout Xikang Province that all transactions must be done in legal tender. Therefore, the Bank of Xikang Province issued 5-cent Tibetan currency notes (see attached photo) to circulate in the market in order to collect Tibetan silver dollars to consolidate the unification of the currency system. One Tibetan silver dollar is equivalent to about 50 cents in legal tender, and each dime is equivalent to ten large copper coins, each worth 200 wen.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of People's Clothing</p>
<p>The clothing of the people of Kangding is quite unique. A few of the clothing styles imitate Han Chinese styles. Most of them have large tops, bare chests and arms, short knives hanging from their waists, long leather boots on their feet, brown faces, and various colored local cloths wrapped around their heads. However, the clothes of the poor are also tattered and stained with oil, making one want to vomit! The women are all tall and have the typical "healthy beauty." Compared to the weak and frail women of the South, there is a world of difference! Every morning and evening, women carry buckets of water on their backs and pass through the streets in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Special Food: Butter Tea</p>
<p>The local people all use butter tea as their daily drink (butter tea: made by mixing butter and tea). Fine butter tea also adds some walnut meat, floating on the tea surface, which tastes fragrant and exotic. Purely refined butter is also quite clean and hygienic, not inferior to the "Beauty Brand" butter sold in Shanghai. Every day, a pound is weighed and sold for 4 yuan and 40 cents in Tibetan currency (2 yuan and 20 cents in legal tender). Ordinary butter is sandwiched in pot blocks (large sesame cakes) as a substitute for rice or snacks, which is actually a kind of nutritious food. The poor people of Sichuan and Kang all use pearl rice as food, but the wealthy still eat rice. However, their method of cooking rice is slightly different from that of the southerners. First, the rice is boiled in water until hot, then the rice soup is poured out, and then the rice is steamed. The vitamins in this rice are actually all lost. Therefore, the so-called eating rice in Kangding is only eating the residue of the rice. There is also a common habit: everyone only eats two meals a day. Lunch is eaten at 11:00 AM, and dinner is eaten at 3:00 PM. Most of the remaining time is spent eating snacks, so the consumption of snacks by the people of Kangding is actually more expensive than one meal a day in the South!</p>
<p>Wealthy people use radios in the evening to listen to news and war reports from the Chengdu Transportation Department Radio Station, but the radio antennas in the entire city are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns!</p>
<h3>Molybdenum and Indium: Rare Metals for Military Use</h3>
<p>— Ju</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of molybdenum, indium, and beryllium? These metals will become as common as chromium (i.e., chrome), platinum (i.e., white gold), and aluminum in the future. These three metals are extremely needed in the military, so they will inspire a new industry because of the war.</p>
<p>Molybdenum is currently scarce, and its value is one British pound per pound. Molybdenum ore only exists in Colorado, and before the war, it was already a metal in short supply. Its use is to be mixed into steel, which can make steel avoid the weakness of being brittle and easy to break. Armored vehicles, steel plates, and gun barrels all need this molybdenum steel alloy.</p>
<p>Indium is a metal that is softer than lead, brighter than silver, and lighter than zinc, and it never rusts. Six years ago, it was worth 60 pounds per ounce, but now it is only worth 6 pounds, and there is a trend for it to become cheaper. Indium is almost like wax, and it melts at a temperature slightly higher than body temperature, so it is most useful for filling gaps and is indispensable for manufacturing aircraft. Before the war, copper was used as a tool for shaping extremely good molds, such as sculptures and dental molds. Other things like lithography also needed indium. During the war, it replaced plaster of Paris, using it to bandage the broken bones of wounded soldiers. The inconvenience of surgeons using plaster of Paris has now been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Beryllium is another newly discovered metal, and it is extracted from magnesite ore after carbonization of magnesium. It is half the weight of aluminum but very durable. So, there is really nothing better than beryllium for manufacturing aircraft engines and fuselages.</p>
<p>There is another mysterious metal called beryllium, which is quite valuable, costing 5,000 pounds per pound. It is very difficult to purify. Its use, in addition to being used as the base for beryl stones for decoration, has not yet been discovered for anything else. The treasures in minerals are increasing day by day, which really makes people feel the sense of "life is finite, but knowledge is infinite"!</p>
<p>Scientific Warfare on the Western Front</p>
<h3>German Positions Surpass Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation; French Army Uses Large Numbers of Pigs to Charge</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>- "Invisible Men" and "Robots" Also Appear -</p>
<p>The more advanced science becomes, the more novel the tactics become. During this European war, when the German army used all its strength to attack Poland, it only maintained strict vigilance on the western front and temporarily adopted a defensive posture. It used many scientific methods to deploy so-called trap warfare. Its wonder may be more than ten thousand times better than the "Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation" described in old Chinese novels. According to soldiers who participated in the Battle of the Huarend Forest, in that area, all appliances and objects were explosive or had deadly electric currents. Once touched, they would immediately fall to the ground and die. For example, a horse's reins placed on the ground would be electrocuted to death if accidentally touched. A dead pig abandoned on the battlefield would detonate a landmine once approached. A French officer rode a bicycle to check the remains of a German soldier, but unexpectedly, explosives were also hidden on the body, and it exploded suddenly, resulting in disaster. Also, when walking on the grass, the moment your foot landed, it would trigger a mechanism and cause a landmine to explode. Even more strangely, even if the German soldiers escaped from the fortress location, you could not rush in rashly, because their defenses were often equipped with many machine guns that automatically fired densely using infrared rays. In addition, all things left behind by the German army, even grass roots and treetops, were equipped with landmine explosion mechanisms, making it impossible to guard against, so it was easy to suffer losses.</p>
<p>However, even though the German army had such amazing formations and clever plans, the French army's method of breaking the formations was even more interesting. Before entering the enemy's position, they first used a group of pigs as a vanguard. They let the pigs run around, and wherever there were landmines, they would all explode once touched, only sacrificing a few pigs, but completely breaking the enemy's traps. Isn't that even better? Even more advanced, the French army also created countless "robots" to charge forward and clear landmines. There were also so-called "invisible men" who penetrated deep into enemy territory, repeatedly achieving miraculous feats in reconnaissance, attack, and occupation tactics. Such a war can truly be said to be fighting wits rather than strength. Customs and Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Custom of Moving Coffins in Kowloon</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>In Kowloon, there is an interesting custom. Coffins are not allowed to be carried up or down the stairs. Therefore, even if the coffin is on the sixth or seventh floor, it must be hoisted from the window along the road. After the encoffining is completed, it must still be lowered from the window to the road. The procedure is difficult and there are many dangers.</p>
<h3>Brief Notes</h3>
<p>The heart of a fish has one chamber, amphibians have two, reptiles have traces of four chambers, and mammals all have four chambers.</p>
<p>The largest tree in the world is in the Kolkata Botanical Garden in India. The tree can hold 10,000 people inside. The tree is 100 feet high and 857 feet in circumference.</p>
<p>The only mammals that can truly fly are bats. Bats can fly quickly in the dark, not because of their eyes. Their wings have a fine mesh of nerves that can sense the slightest vibrations caused by air currents striking solid objects, so they can fly through dense forests in the dark without touching trees.</p>
<p>Of all animals, snails have the largest range of distribution, from sea level to above the snow line of the Himalayas. They also have colonies in the sea, and people have obtained snail specimens from 16,000 feet below the ocean surface.</p>
<p>The water in the Atlantic Ocean is clearest in the Sargasso Sea.</p>
