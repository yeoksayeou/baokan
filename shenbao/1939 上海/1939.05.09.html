<p>社評</p>
<h3>從「二十一條」到「東亞新秩序」</h3>
<p>——以抗戰註銷五九——</p>
<p>今天又是「五九」了。二十四年前，世界各國正瘋在地進行着重分世界的戰爭；當時刧持中國政治的封建餘孽袁世凱，方做子孫帝皇的迷夢。日本遂認爲這是「千載難逢」的機會，厲行對華侵略，以企圖實現其蓄意已久的獨覇遠東的幻想。它首先借了對德宣戰的幌子，出兵進攻靑島，佔據了山東；其後，藉口於中國要求撤兵，即爲侮辱日本，突由駐華公使日置益，向袁世凱提出二十一條件。內容共分五號：第一號各條，要求繼承德國在山東的權利。並擴張日本勢力；第二號各條，使日本在南滿束蒙取得獨佔的地位；第三號各條，將大冶鐵鑛萍鄉煤鑛作爲中日共有；第四號，直欲吞併中國全境，不許他人染指；第五號各條，如指聘顧問等，更是把中國當作日本保護國的條件。總之，這二十一條要求，完全是日本滅亡中國的桎梏。可是袁世凱昏沉於帝制迷夢，不敢痛快拒絕，竟將這樣的大事，密付一二外交官，暗中跟日本進行談判。日本至此，自然更不放鬆，於民國四年五月七日向袁世凱提出最後通牒，限於九日答覆。袁世凱竟於五月九日午前，命曹汝霖送覆書到日本公使館，除第五號各項保留外，其餘一槪應允。要非中國國民的激昂反對，復經國際的仗義執言，袁世凱覆書幾乎成爲出賣中國主權利益的鐵案。</p>
<p>侵略中國是日本傳統的政策，「二十一條」可以說是日本對華野心的初决大暴露。二十四年以來，日本對華的侵略，不曾有一天的放鬆，不過因着國際環境和中國內部情形的不同，而隨時改變其形態。當國際均勢穩定，中國民衆運動活躍的時候，日本就相機緩進，華盛頓會議前後的情形，是一個例子。當國際均勢動搖或破壊，中國民衆運動比較消沉的時候，日本便橫衝衛直撞的邁進，一九三一年的「九一八」事變，就是在這種情形下發動的。</p>
<p>當一九二九年，世界鬧着經濟恐慌，列強焦頭爛額。自顧不暇；日本抓住了這個機會，便在遠束自由行動，以萬寳山事件作試探，反響溫微；終至在一九三一年九月十八日發動了北大營的事變。沒有幾天，肥沃的三省中國土地，三十萬的中國人民，都入了日軍的掌握；那時候，日本「躊躇滿志」，得意忘形，於是又竭力使事變擴大，一九三二年一月二十八日，又爆發了淞滬戰事。雖相持僅一個月，華軍終於後撒，然華軍英勇的戰績，却打破了一般中國人的敗北主義，轉移了國際的對日心理。</p>
<p>侵略者是「得隴望蜀」的，它看到中國的內部散漫國際的苟且和平，到了一九三三年一月，打進了山海關，三月佔領了熱河，又長驅攻陷長城各口。日本武力行動旣然步步得到成功，它就索性要求吞併全中國。一九三四年四月十七日，嗾使姓名不見經傳的天羽，發出聲明；公然排斥歐美各國利益，竟把中國當做日本的保護國。雖然這類聲明，在法理上是絕無地位的，他的本意也不過試探國際；然因此聲明。更暴露了他的野心，同時反證了前後種種外交辭令的虛偽。</p>
<p>這樣，從「九一八」，「一二八」，以至於長城抗戰，中國總是多方的容忍；而日本以爲刺刀可以嚇倒中國，更步步加緊向中國進逼着。然而容忍是有限度的，一九三七年七月七日的蘆溝橋事變，終於引起了中國軍隊英勇的抗戰；「八一三」的號砲，更揭開了中國全面抗戰的巨慕。這是國際的旁觀者所早已見到，且已屢屢警告；但是在日本方面大的覺得意外吧！</p>
<p>現在中日兩國交戰一一十多個月了：中國的浴血奮鬥，已進入了一個新的階段。中國雖然失陷了許多城市，但中國前方士氣和戰鬥精神的旺盛，中國所具國內和國外條件的日趨有利，跟日本恰成了一個顯著的對照。日本方面，也看到中國抗戰的堅決，和全國意志的團結，而不免惶恐戰慄；因此，一面繼續其軍事行動，一面努力於政治陰謀與外交活動，而所謂東亞新秩序，便是政治外交的烟幕！</p>
<p>國際決不爲「東亞新秩序」所蒙蔽，允如英美法各國的對日照會，已作鮮明的吾定；在中國方面，蔣委員長直揭其隱，曾經痛切指出：「建設東亞新秩序這七個字之下，包藏着怎樣的禍心，簡單一句話，這是推翻東亞的國際秩序，造成奴隸的中國，以遂其獨霸太平洋宰割世界的企圖的總名稱。」每一個中國人民因爲外有國際照耀着正義的火炬，內有領袖領導着抗建的國策，而深知日本無論喊着怎樣動聽的口號，打着怎樣好看的幌子，它是非滅亡了中國，或消耗盡了他自己的侵略力量，不會罷手的；因此深知中國非抗戰釗底不可。中國朝野之有此信念，決非中國與同情於中國的人們，以何種詭辯相號召相勗勉所造就，亦非破壞中國的詭辯所得動搖。</p>
<p>從「二十一條」到「東亞校報秩序「·全世界都已看到了日本對中國侵略的步步加緊。而所謂「東亞新秩序，」其實正就是「二十一條」的延續和擴大。二十四年來日本侵略中國的史的敎訓，血的敎訓，終於喚醒了中國四萬五千萬的人民；而今日中國的抗戰，是代替了「五九」，對於「五七」「二十一條」所作的正面答復。換言之，在過去。中國社會以悲憤以眼淚來紀念「五九」；到現在，中國軍隊以壯烈以鐵血來注銷「五九」。國際在往年是空言同情，國際到今日是實力援助！</p>

<h3>美國方面觀察　日本益陷於孤立</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間外交家今日猜測、德義軍事聯盟或將使日本孤立、迫使日本與西方民治國發生較密切之關係、最近硏究日美及日英商業關係專家、亦以爲倘日本與德義發生密切之聯絡、則經濟上將極形脆弱一九三七年英美兩國供給日本以百分之三·八之重要軍需、而義大利對日則幾無所帮助、（七日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>德義同盟　各方觀感不一　德義自認為自然結果　英法謂國際避勢未變　波蘭認國際地位削弱</h3>
<p>（羅馬）義大利民聲報載稱、政界人士對於義德正式訂立同盟、認爲並不驚奇、蓋其意義係在表示兩國諒解並無變更而已、惟以爲此項同盟成立之後、義國已接受公開束縛、較前更爲强固云、義外相之喉舌報載稱、義德已承認雙方各有其利益之範疇、義方爲地中海全部、德國則爲波羅的海及中歐區域、兩國各以完全自主之精神、從事實現其職責、並不嚴迫一方面加以援助、不過祇予以便利而已、唯有一事則彼此之聯帶關係、堅强而一致、卽主義之戰爭是、兩國對此巳有決心、因彼此皆知一方之失敗、卽爲另一方之崩潰云、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>華沙　此間官方對於德義政治軍事協定、在續獲消息之前、拒絕發表批評、惟以爲波蘭對於但澤之任何談判所處之國際地位、已因此協定而减弱、據非官塲方面之意見、義大利簽訂此項協定、本非所願、實迫處此、因其並不願見歐洲因但澤而發生衝突也、同時更以爲墨索里尼似曾獲得德國所予之溫和保證後、始允簽訂此項協定、各報論調皆信目下已爲德國決定波德關係前途之時機、波蘭政府機關報希望德國將選擇和平途徑、並根據波外長柏克所提出之基礎條件、開始談判云、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>米市場昨照常開市　情勢稍見穩定</h3>
<p>惟大戶依然扒進嚴重性未減　評價會今日開會將嚴密取締</p>
<p>上海米市塲因囤戶操縱、以致米價飛漲、現存米糧、較上决調查、的减四萬餘包、評價委員會定今日召開委會、集議穩定辦法、對於投機操縱者、決予査辦、並勸吿切勿作米之投機營業、而免影響民食、並由豆米業公會陳報兩租界當局及市商會、茲分誌詳情如决、</p>
<p>市場情形　依然嚴重</p>
<p>豆米業市塲昨晨九時起、雖照常開市、市塲情形、較前日稍見穩定、但依然甚爲嚴重、高等白粳因十五元限價關係、市塲上已無正式交易、决號各米價格、均已漲至限價、雖經市塲委員會全體委員竭力勸導、結果收效稀少、大戶依然扒進、於是有求過於供之現象、造成持有存米者存心觀望、不見出售、所以成交數目、祇一二千包左右、</p>
<p>評價委會　集議辦法</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會、鑒於國戶投機操縱、以致發生不正當之米價、爲取締囤積投機起見、已決定於今日下午三時、召集第三决評價委員會議、集議嚴格取締具體辦法、擬　切實詳査滬市存米、貨主姓名、同時舉辦存米登記、對操縱投機囤積居奇之大戶、呈報當局、予以查辦、而免滬市米價高漲、影響數百萬市民之生計、並於昨日發出通吿云、逕啟者、本委員會定於木月九日（星期二）下午三時、召集第三次會議、至希台端屆時蒞臨與議爲荷、</p>

<p>切實勸告　維持民食</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晨晤米業某領袖、據談、上海之存米總的五十餘萬包、是項存米之成本、均在限價上下、如照限價出售、已有利可獲、今囤戶乘此靑黃不接之時、操縱米價、以圖厚利、殊屬可恨、今除呈報當局予以查辦外、希望各囤戶顧全大局、共體時艱、切勿作米之投機營業、因米爲市民日常必需之品、與其他貨物性質不同、</p>
<p>黃霉時節　不宜囤積</p>
<p>兩租界內一般市民、因米價飛漲、紛紛向米店購買、於是米號業公會會員米店、連日交易激增、今各米店已勸吿各購米者、上海存米、尙稱充足、來源經疏通後、不致中斷、况際此將近黃霉時節、不宜多購囤積、叉據米業消息、評價委員會所調查之存米、係指各堆棧行號而言、至於市民預購之米、並不包括在內、</p>
<p>竭力設法　疏通來源</p>
<p>各米業團體爲維持滬市民食起見、除取締投機操縱囤積居奇外、並竭力設法疏通來源、因由產地運滬之米、依照目前限價、決不致虧耗、今雖產地受日方統制之影響、以及當地機關限制出境、但米之運滬、並未斷絕、米市渡等處被阻之米、巳絡續放行、連日到滬之貨、每日的三四千包、與往年情形相同、</p>
<h3>浙滬航綫　外輪逐漸開駛</h3>
<p>全部恢復尚待考慮　目前形勢尚未鬆弛</p>
<p>關於滬溫及滬定兩綫航運、經浙東軍事當局批准後、交通已逐漸疏通、惟因時遭日艦阻撓、或扣留等事件發生、致一般外輪、爲避免意外損失、均觀望不前、目前航班寥寥、視將後情形、無其他變化、再行全部恢復、茲經大光社記者、探誌各情如决、</p>
<p>恩德南甯　聯袂來滬</p>
<p>意商中意公司之恩德輪、曾於本月五日、由滬空船直放溫州後、已於六日晚安抵該埠、現正在裝運各項客貨、原擬七日返涊、因裝儎客貨不及、故改於八日晚離溫、如航程中無其他事故躭擱、預料今日午後、當可抵滬、英商太古公司由香港開往溫州之南寗輪、據公司接獲該輪報吿、已在離溫駛滬途中、將於明日下午四時抵滬、</p>
<p>德輪相繼　復航溫州</p>
<p>德商禮和洋行之謀福輪、原擬早日復航溫州、嗣後因德平等輪發生被日艦扣留事件後、致一再展期、茲鑒於英商怡和洋行之利生、太古之南寗、中意之恩德等輪、後復航後、故該輪亦定於今晨（九日）由滬直放溫州、叉德商魯麟洋行之飛康、禮和洋行之海福、均擬明日（十日）復航溫州、如無其他變故、不致改期、</p>
<p>哈納輪改　今日駛定木市德商遠東公司之哈納輪、第一次復航滬定（定海）綫、於七日返抵上海後、其第二决航班原定八日、由滬開出、旋因客貨裝卸時間關係、故延至今日（九日）下午四時離滬駛定、</p>
<h3>西人傳來電訊　日機炸莫干山　該山實際係一中立區　發電人籲請領團維護</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、莫干山避暑會幹事、亦即南方美以美敎會人員貝克曼、昨（七日）晚接莫干山難民收容所負責人諾胡特發來簡略電報、內稱、該杭州北五十公里之著名避暑地、昨晨遭日機轟炸云云、此爲華軍退出杭州區以來莫干山第一决遭空襲、電報中未說明傷亡人數及物質上之損失、發報地爲莫干山附近之孝豐縣、衆信諾氏係飭苦力自莫干山赴最近之電報站發出此</p>
<p>被炸消息</p>
<p>其發出時間爲昨晨一時五十四分、稍有延遲、此間於昨晚十時零二分收到、內稱、「日機今日炸莫干山、促請領事團籲請維持中立區、諾胡特、」聞今居莫干山之雞民甚夥、多屬赤貧者、據貝克曼估計、渠於一月間離該地時、有難民二千人、幾</p>
<p>盡屬婦孺</p>
<p>外人離山時、由華人辦理之國際救濟聯合會照顧此輩難民、協助自立活動、供給免費敎育、諾氏係受請繼東吳大學之希萊茲而留莫干山照料、以中立者之資格、盡其所能、保護該地及難民、中日兩軍均允避去莫干山、故該山爲實際上之中立區、據在該山從事</p>
<p>救濟工作</p>
<p>數月前始來滬之懐特女士、今晨聲稱、該區作戰時、華兵不准留山、華軍均得命令、除非遭日軍壓迫而至極端危急之時、不得臨近該地、華軍均能實行是項保證、華兵旣不能留於該地、該山亦絕未用作華方游擊隊作戰之根據地、故昨晨之遭轟炸、本埠不能舉其合理之動機、據稱、游擊隊寗可利用</p>
<p>孝豐及武康</p>
<p>區中人跡較稀之山、而不願利用游覽地圖上淸晰繪明其途徑之莫干山也、即於日軍自太湖區向京杭公路進犯時、華方正規軍爲居住莫干山平民之利益計、亦不利用該山爲軍事根據地、該山外僑大多於杭州失陷前數月退出、乘公共汽車至寗渡、復搭輪來上海、該决撤退由浙江省府照料、進行順利、</p>

<p>據大通社消息、寗波自上月二十八日、本月一二兩日、迭遭日機在商業區轟炸後、乃六日上午、日機復又飛甬肆虐、當日計來日機七架、在新江橋兩堍、投彈二十一枚、落彈地點、有方井頭。糖行街·銀行街（卽紅厦街）·毛家衖·及北岸之桃花渡·與白沙江面、</p>
<p>燬屋百餘</p>
<p>落銀行街之彈、因雜燒夷彈、故立即起火焚燒、致燬屋一百餘間、居民因事先自動疏散、故並無死傷、惟寗波經此四度浩劫、商業精華、已受重傷、鬧市宛同廢墟、白畫人跡、允爲稀少、但地方行政、照常進行、撫輯救濟、在積極辦理中</p>
<p>日艦擾定</p>
<p>除寗波被炸事件而外、又據大通社記者探悉、定海於六日上午九時、突來日艦一艘、闖入竹山門（即定海口）、逕在衠頭江面停泊、因其無靠埠登陸舉動、故地方當局、亦鎭靜應付、該日艦旋於中午十一時、自動駛離、惟定海城區居民、不免受驚、遷徙者頗形絡繹</p>
<p>工廠遷移</p>
<p>寗波自被日機幾度轟炸後、死傷人數不少、房屋坍損允鉅、昨據該埠居民函滬、自日機轟炸寗波後、商店卽停止日間營業、地方機關及不設門市部營業之各商業行號、均已分別遷出熱鬧區域之外、所有工廠、亦已奉令遷至鄕間開工、居民中之老弱婦孺及非必要之人員、亦已通吿分別疏散、故寗波市面除夜間較爲熱鬧外、日間營業者巳極少、外人僑居寗波者、均分別在其住宅及財產上懸掛旗幟、或繪以極顯明之記號、當局則積極添設各種防空設備、但市面安謐如常、人心亦尙鎭定、</p>
<p>學校停課</p>
<p>據息、寗波自被日機幾决轟炸後、各學校已決定分別疏散停課、大部份學校、自上月底起、均通吿暫時停課十天、期滿後、視情形再另行決定、</p>

<p>浦東川沙縣華軍游擊隊張惠芳部第　大隊長周錦濤、自經上月間率部克復城郊一帶後、即奉命派駐該縣徐家路口、屢予日僞軍以威脅、惟周錦濤曾因上月十六日與日僞軍激戰時、中彈受傷、雖經隊部急送浦西醫治、奈以周氏憂憤過度、竟致不起、業於日昨逝世、爲國犧牲聞者莫不悼惜、</p>
<h3>日本各種公債　國外市場大跌</h3>
<p>四釐公債僅值廿八鎊　其他亦僅四十鎊左右</p>

<h3>港西商會主席盛讚　華商有驚人能力　於極度困難中進行貿易　對促進國際貿易感焦慮</h3>
<p>香港西商會、日昨舉行年會、由施露斯主席、選舉新職員畢、施露斯宜讀去年報吿書、對去年商業作視察叙述、茲探得施氏演詞摘譯如下、</p>
<p>商人困難陳報政府</p>
<p>施氏首論及中日戰爭、謂吾人居留香港、與現在中日戰爭、實有切膚關係、不幸中日戰爭、現尙無停止之可能、吾人袖手旁觀、無法調解、極爲痛心、所差堪滿意者、則香港對戰區難民、稍盡相助之道而已、本商會主要之目的、爲促進國際貿易利益、及門戶開放政策、深爲焦慮、本商會已將商人所感受之困難、陳報政府、但政府百事待理、暫或無暇顧及、吾人須忍耐以待、至英國政府與中國各地英商會、磋商之代表、對轉達各英商意見、多所協助、香港政府對華人在困難中經營商業、亦極注意、吾人於此、應表謝忱、</p>
<p>中國商人驚人能力</p>
<p>施氏述香港去年貿易、謂去年香港商業、大部可稱滿意、然祇爲暫時性質、因長江及華北商業轉移於此之故、十月間廣州淪陷、珠江及廣九路華段封鎖、商業立即减退、但其影響、殊不如吾所料之大、因中國商人有驚人之能力、可於極度困難中、進行貿易、戰事發生後、難民慶集香港、足增加政府困難、然同時有刺激香港商業之作用、在帝國特惠稅則下、製造貨品、供給帝國市塲、去年保持優越地位、此可證該計劃之足以促進帝國貿易、</p>
<p>渴望珠江恢復航運</p>
<p>香港船塢、亦極發達、太古船塢、去年建船四艘、今年初、又代格連輪船公司、建成重一萬噸之「布列千西亞」輪、此爲香港歷來所建最大之船、其姊妹輪「格連羅齊」、亦在該塢建造中、黃埔船塢、去年共建新船十五艘、其中兩艘、爲安南航業公司之「永生」及泰生輪、曾在該塢修理者、有意郵干德羅紫號、香港雖能在現在時局卞、進行貿易但頗受限制、我人渴望珠江重行開放、恢復航運、</p>
<p>製造出口商人利益</p>
<p>施氏繼對帝國空郵計劃、實行擴展至香港、及政府增加派送郵件時間、略爲叙述畢、提出政府擬於一九四九年收回各碼頭問題、謂政府於去年十月間通吿、謂現不擬將碼頭裝修、祇考慮擴展海港、是吾由政府或由商人辦理、或官商合辦、但答允決不多延時間、且接受良好意見、此後即未見政府冉有通吿、故須候政府計劃發表、始能再定、但以政府交由商辦爲佳、施氏繼述及帝國特惠稅制、謂香港製造商及出口商、受其利益甚大、香港在此稅制下、發展最大之工業、爲帆布膠鞋等、</p>
<h3>猶太難民　續到四百</h3>
<p>猩紅熱仍猖獗　一少年已殞命</p>
<p>大陸報云、來自德國之猶太難民四百四十人、乘意郵輪康梯羅素號、昨日（七日）抵滬、此問歐洲難民總數、因此達八千人左右、若輩於午後六時左右在海關碼頭登岸、內孩童佔五十人、亦有少數較不幸之難民、</p>
<p>在輪患病</p>
<p>由歐洲難民委員會醫生送入華盛路猶太難民醫院、病勢並不沉重、據難民向記者表示、彼等曾被禁於祖國某集中營、但彼等均以納粹之報復是懼、故不敢叙述彼等在不願復往的國家中之經歷、本埠委員會已在河濱大厦中安揷新到難民的百人、復有數十人、由救濟團體照顧、在博物院路</p>
<p>敎堂棲身</p>
<p>少數難民、由先彼等而來此之親戚迎之、並暫時供給住宿、據若干抵滬難民稱、由歐啟程、一路安適、暈船者甚少、英文大美晚報云、可怖之猩紅熱症、侵入蘇州河北岸之歐洲難民收容所、至今日（八日）患此症者、共一百十人、昨日午後、有一人殞生、德籍猶太醫生得難民中之志願</p>
<p>看護協助</p>
<p>、刻正盡力遏止此症蔓延、工部局衛生處主任喬丹聲稱、衛生處與醫生合作、在兆豐路臨時隔離醫院中醫治患者、但情勢不允公共租界衛生當局全力援助此輩難民、蓋公共租界人口擁擠、看護人員不敷分配也、同時、衛生人員刻正在發現此症之收容所中</p>
<p>進行消毒</p>
<p>、並盡力協助醫生與猩紅熱之蔓延相博鬥、數日之內、息者達一百十起、雖可驚奇、但此間醫藥界相信短期內、即可滿意的應付此種疫病、昨日殞命者爲二十五歲之靑年、隨其父母於四月三日抵滬、昨日午後四時送入醫院、延至五時許殞生、</p>
<h3>日商上海輪渡公司　發生罷工風潮　日員藉故動輒毆辱員工　公司被逼簽訂保障調件</h3>
<p>日商日淸輪船公司出資所辦之上海輪渡公司、共有輪渡「東溝丸·東昌丸·西渡丸·其昌丸·北京丸·定海丸·威賽丸·高橋丸·江蘇丸·春江丸·吳淞丸·浙江丸·慶寗丸·」等十三艘、昀爲</p>

<p>大班日人</p>
<p>柴田定一故、往往藉郞毆辱各該華籍員工、引起不滿、於昨晨突然全體發生罷工風潮、並提要求數項、以致原定晨間八時開班之各渡輪、臨時受阻、浦東西渡客、亦無法過浦、至十時、公司方面表示讓步、先將老大司機等喚去開行、而售票査票等、則堅持大班須先</p>
<p>簽訂保障</p>
<p>方允復工、故各渡輪於十時許復航後、售票無人、由公司調派內部中日職員十餘名瓜代、因人手小够、全日各班漏票過多、頗受相當損失、及至昨日午後一時、日大班柴田再表讓步、當塲目動</p>
<p>簽字承認</p>
<p>華員要求四項、（一）不得毆打華員、（二）船員於工作時間之外、可輪流離船、售票査票工作時間完畢、即可返家、（三）增加工資一項、由公司從長硏究辦法、（四）無故不得開除華籍員工、風潮始吿解決、離船之售票員査票員等、定今晨全體返船復工、</p>
<h3>赴西南郵員定期　離護赴海防</h3>
<p>開封包裹業已恢復</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局乙級郵務員十名、耍求局方准予離滬赴西南郵區服務、自由該局批准後、即於上週初辦理交替、茲悉該十名乙級郵務員、定於本月十日啟程、乘輪赴海防、由海防轉赴西南各地、又開封大宗商品包裹自於日前停止收寄、頃因該地交通業已恢復、上海郵政管理局即發出通吿云、「自即日起、所有寄往開封包裹、或其相近各地、均可照常收寄、特此通吿」又關於雲南。四川。貴州。等省市大宗包裏、本擬於五月八日（星期一）恢復收寄、惟因海防郵局不及轉運、故來電暫停恢復、至於個人及藥品包裹、仍可照常投遞、</p>
<h3>工部局保護　和平紀念塔</h3>
<p>本埠某西僑團體、爲維持外灘和平紀念塔之觀瞻起見、會函請工部局設法保護該塔、並於必要時加築柵欄、以防閒人入內、工部局當即派捕駐守是處並令飭工務處維持整潔、至該團體所擬加築柵欄一節、以需款的一千五百元、爲本年預算所未列、且柵欄或反損觀瞻、決定緩辦、倘現在所採措置、在三個月內未見成效、屆時當再予以考慮、</p>
<h3>運滬鮮豬又被擅扣　豬業堅持不屈</h3>
<p>豬客向承運公司嚴重交涉　長江外輪裝貨量一落千丈</p>
<p>鮮猪行業爲鮮猪一再被刦、拒絕繳納無名之費用、連日不爲威力屈服、相持以來、猪販因貨不由主、而視運滬銷售爲畏途、致市上鮮肉缺乏、價格飛漲、各肉業決拒售來路不明之猪、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>運滬鮮豬一再被扣</p>
<p>七日到滬之猪、爲日商千代丸承裝鮮猪五百十七隻、德豐丸承裝鮮猪四百七十二隻、叉爲虹口「牲畜市塲」非法扣去、猪客仍向承運公司嚴重交涉、聞該輪來貨中、以嘉豐德昌兩行鉅數之貨亦被奪去、於是長江航運外商輪船公司裝貨數量、一落千丈、允其鮮猪一項更不能自由裝運、</p>
<p>拒購來路不明之豬</p>
<p>聞前日北京路小菜塲有人兜售來路不明之宰白猪肉、被路人斥爲無恥、又榮記肉店主謝某者、因收買來路不明之貨、爲熱心份子前往曉以大義、致起衝突、將白肉拋在地上、迨該店主報捕到塲、始免風波、至其他肉業、均巳堅決拒絕來路不明之鮮肉、宰塲亦停止宰殺是項猪隻、</p>
<h3>救濟公典　積極規劃</h3>
<p>進行辦法正草擬中</p>
<p>査典當爲平民經濟輔助機構、我國典當業、向受傳統之牟利政策、遂致有剝削之嫌、爲社會所誹議、自滬市環境轉移、難民麕集、各界莫不力謀救濟、而該業則乘機崛起、高利貸式之當舖、增加無已、前有吉明齋君等向上海難民救濟協會建議、並呈請財政部籌設公平而含有救濟性質之救濟公典、頃悉財長孔祥熙氏、對於此項建議、頗表嘉許、已批示渝錢字第二二〇六號、略謂「除令飭全國典業减息放期、並飭農民銀行着予低利款外、至於上海籌設救濟公典、旣由呈請人函請救濟協會辦理在案、仍由該會辦理」、茲由吉君等根據批令、再函救濟協會從速辦理、並將詳細商請該會勸募委員胡壽祺君籌劃一切、聞胡君頗以此舉不獨救濟現時平民經濟、而於國計民生、社會安寗、亦有裨益、允予負責積極策動、以期早日實現、</p>
<h3>法巡洋艦　離滬他駛</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法國殖民地巡洋艦白拉柴號、今（八日）晨八時由滬起椗他駛、</p>
<h3>林康侯之訪問　（二）</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>他說上海的市况，在前年年底金融情形，頗蒙受一時的不景氣，可是仗着各方的努力，到去年年底，各商號除新賬無欠宕外，陳賬也還到七成左右，一般的商業情况，大有進步。至於匯劃制度，確是有益金融。接着，他談到中國幣制推進的效率，他說中國社會本來是半現制度，自政府實行廢兩爲元，當時就可以說是準備實行法幣政策；不過必需經過的途徑，是廢兩爲元，然後可以廢元爲幣。現在法幣政策成功，得以在此非常時期，調整一切。周轉如意，確實是中國金融史上最重要的一頁。他對於當時爲廢兩改元及實行法幣的各項貢獻，盡力促成，謙遜不遑，說是盡我應盡之責而已。他對於本報，很爲關心，他說現在申報努力的精神，很可佩服，凡事能努力，必能復興</p>
<p>記者嗣詢林氏以立身處世之道，他說本人平時自律之信條：一，愼說話，愼飲食；二，雖苦應樂；三，朝飯宜早，中飯宜飽，晚飯宜少；四，不要使人怕，應該使人愛；五，有錢不用，等於爲人管賬；有錢浪用，等於一錢沒有。他對於應酬，可以說無處不到，但對無益於社會的事悄，却都不到。對於娛樂，認爲舒展身心應有的調劑，但並不留連，他常常朗誦孟子「有爲者亦若是」「待文王而後興者凡民也」「若夫豪傑之士，雖無文王猶興」；「天將降大任於是人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，空乏其身」；以自勵，對於靑年允常以「後生可畏焉知來者之不如今也」相勉。在記者和他談話的時候，林氏一再朗誦，亦可見他服膺古訓之篤。</p>
<p>林先生的求學和服務經歷，除了記者所知道的而外，他也說了一些，現在綜述如下，以見林氏之服務精神：</p>
<p>他初學於他的父親處，敎館在鄕間，所以他的習尙樸實，由於他認識稼穡艱難而來。繼從他的母舅沈信卿先生學，早年補博士弟子員，即就館於某姓，每節二十金，年共六十金，補以書院膏火（即今所稱獎學金）因當日社會經濟均平，又因他的節用，生活很爲裕如。</p>
<p>他在戊戌政變以前，已覺得中國除非變法是不興的，但是他的看法，却和當時的時彥不同。那時一般主張變法的人士，以爲廢了科舉，辦了學堂，馬上可以富國强兵，但是他的意見，並非是主張不廢科舉，不辦學堂，他以爲廢科舉是一件事，辦學堂又是一件事。科舉本身不是作育，而是甄拔人才的一種工具，學堂方是作育人才的機關。他以爲當時主張變法的人士，廢科舉辦學堂，可以作爲運用政權的工具，實際人民沒有政治訓練，旣不了解變法的內容，更不予以監督和合作的權能，結果却是隔靴搔癢。</p>
<h3>婦女界　昨慶祝母親節</h3>

<p>國際收容所慶祝會</p>
<p>昨日爲母親節紀念日、馬斯南路國際救濟會第一收容所特舉行游藝慶祝大會、三百餘母親、偕其孩子參加盛會、到有紀念會名譽會長裕旦太太·婦女救濟會·大夏大學女生代表·該所所長潘達·及全體中西職員等、裕民蛋廠王五麟先生捐每位母親鴨蛋一只、紀念會發贈糖菓、以示敬意、大及及法政學院女生經募捐款數十元、該所參加生產勞動難胞託兒所亦於是日開幕、由裕旦太太剪彩、游藝節目有話劇及歌舞等甚多、裕且並有演說、略謂、中國現正在新生的大道上長大、因此新中國的母親、任務亦更重要了、以前養子待老積穀防饑的自私自利心理、是已經沒有、你們現在都把孩子貢獻給國家民族了、親愛的新中國的母親們、我願意乘今天這偉大的紀念日、祝賀你們完成新中國母親的偉大任務、使新中國更快些實現、」全體聽衆非常感動、並感謝其對中國及中國母親之熱誠同情、直至五時許、始盡歡而散、</p>

<p>譯報讀者某君等數人、昨日各送偽造該報信封一件給該報、封內均有印刷品一件、題為「舉一個例」、係汪精衛所作、即曾由吳稚暉予以　斥者、此項偽造信封、無論在紙色上、墨色上、字跡上、尺寸上、均與為譯報信封逈不相同、譯報眞信封紙色純白、該偽造信封則係淡妃色、譯報眞信封係用珠紅色印、該偽造信封則係洋紅色、且譯報眞信封比該偽造信封亦寬、字跡懸珠、排列地位亦有差異、此種偽造、顯欲中傷譯報、矇騙讀者、實則譯報立場、早為社會所共悉、決夫人置信其事、反而表露汪精衛及其黨徒之慣於揑造、使人連想『舉一個例』中所謂之例、全屬造謠中傷也、</p>

<h3>研究腦與電氣之初聲</h3>
<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>蔣委員長致訓於數萬里之外。而孤島民衆。可以歷歷聽其演講。飛機相距數百里之遙。而我得豫知其來蹤。此非電氣學發達之力乎。故曰，二十世紀之世界。電氣世界也。余於腦與電氣之關係。夙有窮究其至理之志願。嘗遇人而言曰。人身有電。可由髮膚。以資證明。凡稍具科學智識者。莫不知之。蓋人腦之中。不論智愚賢不肖。均備有電氣收發機關。譬如某甲企念某乙而往訪之。此時某甲腦中所發電波。漸漸達於某乙腦中之收電中樞。而使感應。則某乙企念某甲之意。遂不期而同時勃發。此種意想。本不背電學原理。惜余未能作進一步之硏究耳。近讀培爾格爾之論。有與余之理想。足資印證者。其言曰，人腦有電。試以毛髮爲導體而實騐之。即可證明有震動波長短不同之二種電流。一爲有規則而絕不變更之電流。此電流之震動數。一秒鐘凡八乃至十二决。一爲不規則而變動非常劇烈之電流。其震動數實超過前者之白倍。一秒鐘凡千餘决。培氏名其前者曰一埃爾歪　（即a　）波。後者曰一倍他」（即B）波。「a波者。不問智愚强弱。人人相等。恰如人類體溫。不問男女老幼。均爲三十七度。「B波則絕不如是。尋常不見通流於人腦。及其人之精神或感情緊張活動之際。則「B電流。始於腦中流通。而掩覆其常備之一a一波。是猶高熱一起。而牛溫即爲高熱掩覆之理也。且「B」波流通於腦之時間。不能持久。久則人必不支。是猶人體不能久禦高熱之理也。故「B波之動作。實或起或伏　。而無定則者也。培氏之說如是。與余所謂人腦有電氣感應之作用者。若合符契。且允與培氏一刀波之旨相近。願與有志電學者。共硏討之。</p>
<p>通俗醫話</p>
<h3>談丹田呼吸和健康</h3>
<p>— 汪于岡</p>
<p>據通常所指丹田的體位，是在小腹部。這種呼吸式，在道家及拳術家參修內功上，據說是很爲重視，但是不知道法和拳術的我，斷難窺測他們所以重視的理由，不過從我們醫學方面的生理作用上來探討一下，多少可以說出丹田呼吸和人生的健康關係來。</p>
<p>從生理上來說，人類的呼吸運動的式子，可分爲兩種：一種稱爲胸式呼吸，是靠了靠肋肌的伸縮，而使胸廓伸縮，一種稱爲腹式呼吸，是靠了腹肌的伸縮，而使腹壁仲縮。通常男子多腹式，女子多胸式，而在臥位時，不分男女均成胸腹式。照丹田體位在小腹而論，則丹田呼吸是屬於腹式呼吸無疑，不過他的意思是要使腹部呼吸運動充分發展到小腹，使他的作用完全發揮到腹腔全部</p>
<p>年來人們很多注意到深呼吸運動，所謂深呼吸運動，大家認爲是專指努力胸式呼吸別名，而並不含有努力腹式呼吸的意義，這是人們在生理和衛生上底忽略和義俗，我們應該竭力糾正而加以提倡的，爲什麼緣故呢？因爲努力胸式呼吸，是可以使胸腔內的肺臟和心臟血流通暢，新陳代謝吒盛，於是肺部健全，抵抗力强，不易罹病，這是的確不差的道理。但是腹腔內還有許多臟器呢？難道血流不必通暢，新陳代謝無須旺盛，所以把同一深呼吸運動的努力腹式呼吸這樁事完全忽略了。不然的話，我們應該提倡丹田呼吸，要和努力胸式呼吸一樣重要，或許還要有意義些，這並不是我過甚其辭，危霄聳聽，要想博得意想不到的效力，事實是如此，呼吸器的生理作用簡單，僅司吸養呼炭的職務，而腹腔內臟器的生理作用繁複，較肺臟何啻倍蓰，所以允有加强必要，其中尤著功效的爲消化器。目舉一個例，我平時對於習常便秘病人說，瀉藥是不宜常服的，你要糾正這病，有個簡便的方法，在每晚上床後，取四平八穩仰臥位，行努力腹式呼吸四五十决，能達到丹田更好，明日早晨起床前，照樣行一次，結果能使習常便秘消除，每日大便通暢，同時食慾增進，消化佳良，這是已有經騐的事實，病者不妨試試。但是有胃潰瘍或蚓突炎，或腎炎的人不宜嘗試，吾則有誘發該病的危險，照此事實，腹式呼吸對於腹腔內臟有利的影響是很顯著的</p>
<p>德國杞而歇奈而氏曾用吸角Saugglocke置於腹壁施行吸引和押出運動，以變更腹腔內壓的活動，也無非是這種意義，其結果除消化器受良好影響外，對於循環障碍患者，可使之血壓下降，脈搏緩慢，但是我覺得用吸角來變更腹壓，未免方法太拙劣了，不如運用努力腹式呼吸來得自然和簡便得多。</p>
<p>食養常識</p>
<h3>食養之科學研究（續第十五期）</h3>
<p>— 周振禹</p>
<p>CO2+H2O+日光+葉綠茶→H2CO3</p>
<p>炭氧二　水　炭酸</p>
<p>H2CO3+日光+葉綠素→H．CHO．O2</p>
<p>炭酸　中　　氧（遊離分出）</p>
<p>6（H．CHO）+日光+葉綠素→C6H12O6</p>
<p>六甲　　硫葡糖（炭水化物）</p>
<p>經多人之硏究，知其爲紫外光之作用，今可用人工太陽光仿造之，故已證明無疑矣。在植物體內，此種光化作用，稱之曰光化營造作用（Photosynthesis）也。</p>
<p>植物藉光化營造之作用而成形，以供吾人之食養，由此日光之熱量，則間接傳與人體，其法一也。牲畜之生，亦多賴諸植物者，蓋因動物之所需，亦若人之所需，惟人爲萬物之靈，故其具有特能，用之而作食養，以資添補身體之所求，是以日光之熱量，傳遞於人，共法二也。故日光之於人類，共利益之偉大，誠爲吾人所未能意料者也。</p>
<p>人之於世，各有天賦之責，因責守之別，操作之輕重，各不相同，因之食養，亦各有別。今旣知熱量之來源及共佔測之方法，敢再以熱量之多寡，分別論之。</p>
<p>凡中等身材之靑年至中年之男子，如無所操勞，其食養足以適合身體之需要者，每日的需二千個熱量，如或爲輕微之操作，如散步等等，則須加添一二千之多。男子中等身材云者，乃指其體重的爲七十基羅克蘭姆，的合一百五十四磅也。體重較重或較輕者，如其操作無甚更變時，食養可以增减，或按照其體重，以比例推算之（另詳）。</p>
<p>普通女子，其體重佔男子五分之四，的合八折計算也。男女之操作雖相同，所用之熱量，僅佔男子之五分之四耳。蓋因女子基本新陳代謝作用，較男子低百分之五。此種差異，或因身體所含脂肪之百分率所致。例如一瘦長之男子，體重與一矮壯之男子相等，但其基木新陳代謝作用不等，故瘦者多食，而其瘦仍如斯，矮壯者，其胖則愈增也。基本新陳代謝作用當另詳之，不贅述於此。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　爲有從中吸收　現金漲風擴大</h3>
<p>昨現余烚赤暗盤市况、在買氣籠罩下、漲風驟然擴大、市勢亦復吿混亂、竟接連打破二千一百二十元及三十元二層關口、一度曾昂達二千一百三十四元高峯、實因塲中傳聞「華興銀行」行將開幕、且暗中已在進行收買黃金之傳說、因之各方人心頓被激動、某金號續代華南帮猛進不怠、兼證券帮亦進多出少、更有某錢兌業代客大量搜購、致雖有銀樓帮曁金號等吐售、無如供求數量、依然懸殊、致價向高峯推進、惟在晚收前因浮多趁高、獲利了結、故稍起回風、終則猛漲十八元、交易大盛、全日達一千五百七十兩、銀樓飾金亦步高二元、海關金與中英純金等屹然呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤跳十八元</p>
<p>自晨每條五十兩、初開頗平、首由銀樓帮互做五十兩、二千一百二十元爲開盤價較之上週末午取做高七元、開後銀樓帮叉進錢兌業五十兩、價與晨開相同、繼之現金號互做五十兩、價十九元、後證券帮亦塞予錢兌業及金號各五十兩、價均十八元、此後雖某金號代客大量收購、奈銀樓帮與金號頻塞亦力、致形勢穩定、某金號進銀樓帮共二百兩、價則相同、繼之叉進同業二百兩、價亦十八元、後錢兌業互做七十兩、價仍十八元、時聞外滙期貨帶軟、且經某方暗中活動、人心頓被激動、某錢兌業吸力轉强加之證券帮亦來猛進、市勢頓吿向榮、衝出二十元關口、某錢兌業進同業五十兩、價十九元、又進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十元、某銀樓代客亦吸進同業五十兩、價竟飛躍五元、爲二十五元、某錢兌業再進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十七元、後證券帮進某金號百兩、價廿八元、相同價又進銀樓帮五十兩、再進某錢兌業五十兩、價二十七元、未幾某錢兌業轉手即復進同業五十兩、價二十六元、此後買風漸弱、散戶均趁高脫售、遂反動向下、錢兌業賣予金號五十兩、二十二元僞午收價、午後因某金號與某錢兌業續來猛進、故而漲風重熾、初開即抬高六元、乃由某錢兌業進同業五十兩、價二十八元、後某金號進錢兌業五十兩、價二十九元、不久又進錢兌業五十兩、價三十二元、後某錢兌業與證券帮相繼力進百餘兩、價遂做高至三十四元、均由錢兌業及金號供給、時浮戶趁高獲利吐售者頗湧、故遂稍回、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價三十一元、此後賣方雖减二十八九元、但因進者觀望，致難做開、故晚收仍爲二千一百三十一元、結果較上週六午收軋漲十八元、全天十六元差度、現金號本牌金售出價二千一百三十五元、收進二千一百二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛大二元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨九時四十五分大同行因烚赤價已漲至二千一百二十元關口、故遂掛大一元、後至十時二十分因烚赤市勢更堅故再掛大一元、同時新同行亦掛大一元、此後均無變動、計大同行改懸二百十六元、新同行爲二百十四元、收進的二百令八元、</p>
<p>中英純金不動</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、仍呆定於一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦未更動、計一千二百〇七元六角、乃六日倫敦電、英純金仍無軒輊、每盎斯爲七鎊八先令六辨士所致云、</p>
<h3>外滙有　洋花結款</h3>
<p>期貨略見緊縮</p>
<p>滙市昨因油洋行亞細亞曁洋花商等結款紛紜、兼華商投機家亦跟踪扒結、更以英行有利（代天津帮）與日銀行界亦競相猛扒期貨美滙、然而英美等外商銀行、對於現貨尙肯照維持價供塞、但以期貨供意較淡、於是情况、遂呈現平期軟之象、中途洋行扒進現貨美滙、而套出七月份期貨、共貼進美金二角半、計月息除佣的有五釐之譜、然仍難引起殷富套利者之趣味、一天交易頗旺、至港滙初因錢兌業賣意頗濃、一度帶硬、後以洋行頻吸、遂復回平、終則仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均長一二五、紐的銀價呆定如故、倫教生金亦平、滙兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英·對滬·對法亦均無更動、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英滙八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之上週末午收、均無上落、開後雖洋花結款頗繁、兼華商投機家亦跟踪扒結、無如英美等各外銀行供意亦濃、致無變化、計洋行結進滙豐麥加利現貨英金八辦士二五、繼之又與華商投機家相繼扒結、某行現貨美滙十六元〇六二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大七厘半、計徵百分之七·〇〇、此後油洋行亞細亞亦購結滙豐七月份英金八辦士一二五、後英行有利（代天津帮）亦吸進荷蘭七月份美匯十五元八一二五、時日銀行亦購結洋行七月份美滙十五元八一二五、是以期貨爲狀略帶軟化、近午外行安達·荷蘭吸進錢兌業現貨港滙五十五元八七五、其時狀况尙平、不久外行納胃轉淡、對於以上吸進價、亦肯塞出、故潛勢稍硬、迨午收銀行現貨賣價、英美兩滙、均與晨開無異、港滙五十五元八七五、</p>
<p>後市英行有利續代津帮先向滙豐扒結現貨英金八辦士二五、繼又結進華比某行美匯十六元〇六二五、過程依然無變、入後洋行購結荷蘭·安達現貨港匯五十五元七五、狀况回平、迨晚收銀行現貨賣價英滙八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、港匯五十五元七五、結果較之上週末午收、英美港三匯、均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊復漲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、如紗花帮日銀行亞細亞等吸納頗健、幸外銀行供給暢達、烚赤變動倐忽、錢兌業客戶等、扒納甚旺、市價上漲激烈、聞係代天津帮及本埠僞方華興銀行吸收、近午金號趁高拋塞、下午錢兌業購吸復盛、供給未暢、市價上漲甚銳、外幣英美金鎊需要復盛、市價跟烚赤高漲而昂貴、英美金票供求頗暢、香港票安南票需要頗殷、價趨上升、聞係公務人員赴西南、道經港越之需用、僅法郞票供給稍盛、價稍回降、公會交易未盛、承泰出永泰進新加坡票四百元、森泰出勤泰進香港票一千元、承泰出勤泰進香港票五百元、昨日市價、英美金鎊各升二角、香港票升五厘、法郞票降七毫半、安南票升一分、其他俱未更動、</p>
<h3>津港申滙微升</h3>
<p>天津「僞鈔」大跌小回</p>
<p>天津　八日電、匯兌行市與六日（上星期六）比較、英匯續縮一二五、美滙亦續縮二五、申匯漲一元七角五分、茲將上午開盤市價列後、</p>
<p>英匯　七便士八七五</p>
<p>美匯　十五元一二七五</p>
<p>申匯　一〇四元七五</p>
<p>（申滙爲申交法幣百元天津應收之數）</p>
<p>「附註」天津匯市自上星期三（三日）起連縮五天、昨日（八日）與二日（上週三）比較計英滙縮三一二五、美匯縮六二五、申匯每百元計漲三元七角五分、</p>
<p>又天津僞「聯銀券」暗盤行市、上午開盤與六日上午開盤比較、計貴一元、法幣百元、可買「聯銀券」一百三十元、即「聯銀券」一元、僅値法幣七角六分九一）三、</p>
<p>香港　八日電、英美申滙兌行市、上午開盤與六日（上週六）十一時三十分價同、至下午三時四十五分、申匯漲二角五分、價爲一七九元二五、英美匯價、全日毫無變動、市面安定、茲將上午開盤市價如下、</p>
<p>英匯　一先令二便士七八一二五</p>
<p>美滙　二十八元八一二五</p>
<p>申滙　一七九元</p>
<p>（申匯爲港紙百元合上海法幣之數）</p>
<h3>糧食　米市之關鍵</h3>
<p>照目前尙不在供求關係　只要嚴正管制公平分配　米價當可重復趨入正軌</p>
<p>昨日米市仍混沌、緣市上北粳、旣全未出樣、而南粳及薄稻應市、亦極少數、大都宿貨居多、市價悉照限價、故店家欲思採辦高貨、竟無從購得、同時杜洋埠尖亦仍絕跡、僅盈屬之中關客尖、曾大量湧出、而價亦開十四元、次若砶米、開出亦達十五元四五角、變元因不受限制、逐步飛騰、高貨已開出二十一元、中貨亦達二十元零五角、</p>
<p>此决米價上漲、米商方面、大事宣傳、將責仟歸諸囤戶、不肯放出、確屬因米糧囤戶、大都是銀錢業及殷富巨賈、此輩平常所食用之品、貴於米價者不知多少、焉知一般對於米賣之苦痛、故祇望其價貴、價愈貴則其所得愈多、享用愈優、至謂米商果眞能爲民食着想亦難置信、蓋速日到貨並未見絕、河下車輪俱有來貨、何以不肯在限價原則之下、分別售開、而乃在抬喊高、衝破限價、故照現在之米市情形、存米充足、到貨不絕、不能謂爲供求不稱關係、全爲囤戶之壟斷居奇、米商之借名操縱、與販商之不肯出樣、一言以蔽之、大家想從民食方面發一注財、此等局面、固不難打破、使之入於正軌、只要嚴正管制、公平分配、則囤戶米商販戶均不致無利可獲、民食亦不虞艱難、吾則米商可歸咎於囤戶、囤戶亦可歸過於米商、且即使囤戶之米盡入米商之手、能保無操縱壟斷之弊吾、誰實信之、不過欲做到此兩點、非同業公會所能收效、此亦必然之勢也、</p>
<p>洋米在連日米價飛漲中、亦逐步提升、昨零整西貢一律報昇、高貨陳西貢喊至十九元二三角、成交價亦在十九元左右、因此昨日糧商已有向洋行接洽打電詢價、照上週末電報劃二十元左右、則與滬價已不到一元、滬市冉昇而產價稍平、則定貨就可接近矣、聞甬帮方面亦有五萬包在接洽中、咋日由香港來米七百九十包、福州來米二百包、</p>
<p>客秈昨市特高貨擯不售開、而十四元限之蕪秈亦屬大市質、决蕪秈亦至十三元七八角、珀秈十三元四五角、新到之餘州糙秈開十一元八角、以售開價格而論、則高秈尙差五六角、昨日晨間尙有新囤問津、故中次貨續見暗挺、午市行囤趁高晚手、後市乃見回定、全日成交五千六七百包、</p>
<h3>麪粉漲風又起</h3>
<p>本街批價加升五分　大批洋粉直運客埠　廠粉</p>
<p>昨粉市漲風又起二號粉廠盤本街批價加升五分、與客盤同爲四元五角半之現鈔、蓋本街與客帮批價、參差亦經數日矣、昨爲週初之期、各廠以原料價貴、存粉不充、開市即日喊高、惟客帮銷塲平淡、北洋帮以匯水關係、兼有洋粉辦去、故新交易無意多取、僅零星點綴及添辦三四號粉數千包而已、是以客盤未能再提、僅本街批價加增、以示一致、統市成交各牌粉併計的五萬包左右、除本客交易外、近日內地帮零銷尙不寂寞、故市面仍有看好之可能、査麵粉出口今日有一萬一千二百包、遝往福州</p>
<p>洋粉</p>
<p>洋粉市情、續吿平靜、査近日新到各貨、除一部份待價而沽外、大批到貨、直接轉運華北等處、及轉輾運銷客埠、故市塲供源仍感稀少、貨方堅持如故、中檔牌子價開四元五角半現鈔、連費在內、與本廠粉售價相仿、至國外產價仍昂、期洋粉定價的二元八角之美金、惟市傳有四元四角半期洋粉兜售、但未聞有成交、</p>
<h3>油餅　兩星期中　連豆猛跌九元　期現餅亦下挫</h3>
<p>豆油</p>
<p>自期貨停止拋售後、日商方面入休止狀態　故一般投機家即乏推波助瀾之伎倆、現油叉源源來滬之情形下、銷塲驟形淸淡在此兩星期中、豆油共跌去九元、此種風在雨暴之漲跌、以環境特殊爲理由、業中又大肆活動、謂無操縱、其誰能信、昨花生油無交易做開、豆油祇有大連油成交一百二十桶、價自四十元零八角步跌至四十元收盤、銷塲爲本街內地云、</p>
<p>生油昨由香港來五千聽、又豆子二千七百包、天津來、叉二千二百包、烟台來、今日有六百包、運往福州、</p>
<p>豆餅</p>
<p>交易仍祇大連貨有市、現餅去路雖非大量消化之時、但零星銷塲尙屬不斷、行情在上星期中祇有分譜上落、昨市因六月份期餅挫跌三分、致牽掣下辱、交易祇妥什牌一千片、價爲二元八角半、比上週六亦跌三分、期餅亦祇有六月份有交易，昨市行情自三元零二分半、（訂明源記牌號交貨）步跌至三元零五厘、共成交七千片、訂雜牌餅交貨價爲三元至二元九角八分、成交二千片云、</p>
<h3>證券　債市不脫盤旋</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市依然盤旋、午前則由平轉堅、旋又漸疲、午後由平而疲、復又稍堅、而其高低範圍、祇在一角至一角半之間、趨勢完全因人心恍惚、多空各不相讓、致演成此種呆滯局面、環境如無顯著變化、市價尙不致有鉅大漲跌也、昨日經過、開盤賣方有十四·三十八·叫十一等號及大豐順利號、買進者有大通同康及二十號、市價稍疲即起、稍堅即壓、始終於一角行市間盤旋不巳、午後交易史淸，祇丁種因抽籤關係、交易較多、此種公債、爲第七决抽籤前最後之一日、十日即舉行抽籤、故買進者較多、永豐及四十二號略有吸收、天生潤利均略有出籠、市價依然平淡無奇、結果高低仍無一致、成交亦祇三十餘萬元而已、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>今日爲五九國恥紀念、停市一天、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股七十餘股、價爲五元五角、比前略堅一角之譜、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市以數種精選股票最爲堅挺、如耶松股及瑞鎔股、蓋預料其將有良好之股息、以致見新高貨、並瑞鎔股有巨大之成交、公共汽車股亦漲至三十元之新高價、墾殖股交易亦暢、惟價格無大上落、上海銀公司股暗澹、怡和股平靜、橡皮股殊難成交、因買價與賣價實相差太遠、</p>
<p>中國營業公司普通股、今日見有三角之成交、惟照其改組計劃而論、則八厘債券應合値七十九兩、而上週六成交祇有五十六兩、其中未知爲普通股價値太高、抑或八厘債券價値太低歟、故殊勝詫異、但無疑將來定能合値相等也、</p>
<h3>請看今日之生活　竟是何等之艱苦</h3>
<p>肉食固貴……　能肉食或尙不覺其爲貴　亦昂……　斯一般生活乃大感苦痛</p>
<p>上海自八一三戰事爆發以來、人民生活、頓見提高、除房屋因人口驟增而租金猛漲外、家庭中之日用物品、亦莫不繼漲增高、至生活所必需之食品、如米糧菜蔬、以及「開門七件事、柴米油鹽醬醋茶」、無一不漲、如葷菜之鮮肉、腿精每斤一元、中肋條每元祗購斤叫兩、活雞每元一斤二三兩、鮮魚每斤亦須三四角至八九角不等、至平民視爲最便宜之素食品、若「荳芽菜及鹹菜豆腐」等物、現因原料之黃豆及生豆油價、受日人之操縱、突飛猛晋當今春初、生豆油每元可購五斤七八兩、現只購三斤不足、是以視爲最便宜之食品亦不廉矣、茲將最近所漲之食品售價錄左、</p>
<p>（一）荳腐店各物（單位角）</p>
<p>（二）麵坊店各物售價（單位文）</p>
<p>（三）菜塲中最廉之素菜（單位角）</p>
<p>上列素菜品之售價、校未戰前大都漲起三分之二、亦有漲上一倍者、如豆腐前售每塊十文、現則須二十文、腐干每塊十五文、現售三十文、鹹菜豆芽起碼四五十文可購、現則起碼四五分洋碼矣、大衆生活之艱苦、皆係侵略者之所賜也、</p>
<h3>紗花　浮多一片斬結聲現紗價慘瀉十元　大有昨是今非之慨</h3>
<p>紗市續疲跌風復起、蓋實需雖比上日爲多、但仍無巨量發展之象、加之大戶頭有一部份心思看其回挫可能、一等共下跌廉宜後、再行收進、因之人心平淡、市盤乃迂迥而下、浙東溫州方面、業已有輪開駛運輸、須待其回滬、如路途平安、本週中或有較吒之生意起色也、故目前大宗意見、均抱覜望態度、午後虛風驟起、且跌勢在驟、浮多鑒於環境不良、一律斬結、二十支雙馬外棧貨跌破四百二十元關口、棧單貨亦追踪而下、進十元關口、如此情形、可想經營者心神恍惚也、造成猛進疾退之局面也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初同業相聚、談論乏勁、因各路實需冷淡、無電委託、市况又呈趦趄不前之象、開盤跌一元半、二十支變馬棧單價爲四百十六元、但現貨價格旣疲、而採辦者更稀、價爲四百二十三元、少頃一般流動掮客、在市呌喊出賣者猶如拍賣聲、市盤逐步下降、迨至收盤現貨價爲四百十八元、棧單價爲四百十二元半、午後開盤、賣客叢集、買進者零落不堪、二十支特金城現紗雲南帮進二十包、比上午價猛降八元之譜、人心頓見恐懼、一時賣風突起、售價續瀉、收盤價雙馬現貨四百十五元、棧單價爲四百零六元半、此種跌風、求免太暴、實則昔日之抬價過度、昨日之反映、益覺太劇也、査全日各帮買去統計一千八百九十五包、一行情二十支雙馬紗跌八元、雙地球跌十元、特金城在落十元、一十支粗紗亦跌三四元、今日有棉紗七十一件運汕頭、八十七件昨尙有七十五件均運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、二八五香港一五五內地　三五</p>
<p>雲南　一三〇汕頭一一〇統計　一、八九五</p>
<p>日紗市價昨已頻頻下降、實以前日在漲之反動也、市塲人頭較前大爲减縮、聲勢冷淸、然售價日下、蓋以各方無需要、叉有人說、棉織廠反有賣出、因紗價好、織成布疋、利鈿不及生貨厚、有此情形、現紗不能站脚、二十支月琴紗前後兩市一蹶不振、收盤價爲三百六十三元、比上日跌十二元、</p>
<h3>外市雖高漲　巴西棉尙有交易</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、頗呈活躍之狀、市上現貨、因政府之貸款棉款放出問題尙無確悉、然前因受出口津貼之說、引起各方賻買、因此市上現貨日見减少、日來同業交易甚旺、空頭亦有大批抵補、結果收盤比日前漲六至十磅音、印度速同預測跌一羅比、（惟據最後消息、今日印度市價漲二羅比、）埃及停市、滙兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲五角、埃及棉漲五角、印棉跌八角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因連日海外棉市高漲、各廠交易暫形停頓、惟日方仍在市收購頗烈、昨日巴西棉尙有交易、均爲各商業所訂購、皆六月份裝、棧交每祖的八十五元左右、週內將有二輪由美裝運來滬、共有一萬六千餘包、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價列下、</p>
<p>本棉生意依然沉悶不堪、售價與上日無甚軒輊、廠方需要甚滯、大概儘將到貨應用、故對於本棉採辦之稀少、猶如鳳毛麟角、實則貨物缺乏之廠方、雖有辦意亦無從着手、因之趦趄不前、蘇北來源、兩日計到通州花三百餘包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>紗價大上大落</h3>
<p>是人力造成之必然結果</p>
<p>近日現盤市價、波濤洶湧、疾風暴雨、査其原因、的如下述、</p>
<p>（一）現紗市價在春起以前、徘徊於三百八·九·十元之問、此時華南廣西接得委託、在各方搜羅的有五千包、二十支雙馬天女兩牌爲大宗、尙有二千包、係客商跟進、綜計七千包、辦貨之價、大概在三百八·九·十元爲最多、其决四百元外、紗市得此躉批交易、基礎愈固、市面乃欣欣向榮矣、</p>
<p>（二）紗市實際地位、投機商忽來活動、同時「日僞」華興銀行創立、市上謠言紛紜莫衷一是、於是買者推波助瀾、爭先恐後、只要買進造成四百五十元之高峰、豈料漲度過暴、實銷束手、籌碼反見充溢、跌風頓熾、昨日價已敲破二十元關口、爲四百十五元、比上星期一之高價、相差三十五元之巨、實則昔日之漲、全爲實銷暢旺、近昔來之在騰泰半是人工所造成、所以裂痕一現、猶如江河日下、根本問題、還在消費之多寡、爲市價漲落之標準、吾則專賴人力來做作、殊難持久、（山）</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋跌風轉猛　國布客銷淸淡</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>市况平疲、客路實銷均無起色、人心轉趨下游、蓋以週前漲風過猛、引起大衆囤風、與現銷旺盛時期、供不應求之漲風、適成相反、此時現銷愈形淸淡、散戶賣價、異常鬆濫、惟件額均屬細碎、而一般囤戶態度鎭定、故布市回風不烈、細布·細斜·組布售盤每疋跌五分至一二角、漂染布疋亦跌一二角不等、本街·江北帮·湘帮·成交細布·細斜五十餘件、粗布六十餘件、本街江浙游擊區零疋拆件白布包交易、絡繹不絕、昨進三千數百疋、蘇北·泰州·興化國軍轄地、亦辦近千疋、以淺色布疋·府綢·蔴紗·色布·印花布爲大宗、川滇粤帮新添辦一致稀少、定貨裝發仍旺、浙東溫州定海雖已復航、然銷貨障碍孔多、故裝貨極寡、係屬試辦性質</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨於上週末回漲後、昨仍以色布銷塲退步、散戶爭先賣出、跌風轉緊、晨市龍頭細布現貨十三元九角、木月期貨首開十四元二角半、更降至十四元一角、現貨亦一度至十三元八角、較上週每疋計跌二角至三角、寳貝細斜亦跌三角、開售十二元五角半至六角、行方無開貨、本街成交五六百件、大戶囤貨扳提仍力、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>九日疋頭出口、七十八件運福州、十五件運汕頭、二十五件運香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　橫濱絲又創高價</h3>

<h3>茹素</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>凡是要想有所成就，必須具備的積極條件是：精神第一，物質次之，而形式又次之。這差不多已是鐵一般的定律。中國要想抗戰建國，其主要的條件，也不外乎此。最近發起的精神總動員，可以說是抗戰建國中探原的一著。</p>
<p>今天是中國舉行最久而意義也是最嚴重的國恥紀念日。歷年在上海一隅，都有下半旗以及其他紀念的舉動。今年情形特殊，中國各界民眾，已經商定，在這天不懸半旗，也不舉行任何集會，而茹素一天，以誌哀痛。這的確是一個好辦法。</p>
<p>懸旗是形式，形式也可以代表精神，有時也很需要。但是到了這個形式不變舉行時，權其利害輕重，自然以捨形式而趨重精神為上。只要有那樣的淨勝，忍辱負重，誓報國仇的精神，形式上，甚至物質上，有些缺憾，都不要緊。何況現在除了懸旗以外，正還有著別樣的紀念方法，茹素。</p>
<p>茹素在中國的習俗上是表示虔敬與哀痛的。以哀痛的心來誌恥，茹素很適配；以虔敬的心來雪恥，茹素尤其適配。茹素也就等於臥薪嚐膽。中國民眾，尤其是在上海的，誰不記得這恥？那末，大家就應該茹素。這等於懸旗的形式，而又含蘊著堅韌奮鬥的精髓，還可以有助於所需要的物質，爲什麽不茹呢？</p>
<p>德國要雪凡爾賽和約之恥，她的國民就都不吃白搭和牛肉，束緊了褲帶，省下錢來造飛機大礅。這等於長期的茹素。假使中國民眾，在這一天都能茹素，將省下來的錢，獻給國家，其數目一定也很可觀，而有助於抗戰的力量，總也不會小吧！</p>
<p>其實，在這一天，中國民眾就是絕食也是應該的，又豈但茹素而已。因為假使大家再不知赤而發奮，亡國是一定的結果；亡了國若不為人逼得食不下咽，或無物可食，就必和猶太人一樣，到了王國的忌日，總要自動絕食一天。在現在就有絕食的精神，堅持到底，我相信將來就是茹素，也將成為不必要了。</p>
<p>哀者必勝，素亦所以誌哀，有必勝的信念者，當樂於茹素吧！</p>
<h3>超過前代</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我們接受下一份工作，從前代手中。</p>
<p>一部人類的歷史，當是塗滿了奮鬥的血，有烈士的成仁，也有鬼蜮的腥腐。像龍與蛇相鬥，互相扭打了幾千萬年，光明與黑暗相互代位。沒有永遠的光明，也沒有永久的黑暗。</p>
<p>正義的人捨身奮鬥，從「邪惡」的手裏奪取光明。火種被「邪惡」者攫去了，於是宇宙渝為地獄，幽深，黑暗，寒冽。沒有太陽，沒有月亮，沒有星斗，沒有火光。怯弱的乃寒僵如秋蟲，呻吟，泣訴，哀怨，悄悄地抑鬱而死。勇敢者，堅貞者，明識者，不能屈辱於命運，乃各自攘臂而起，願以自己的血肉，委於山谿；如是，搭成一座橋，好讓讓他們子孫渡過深澗，跨越幽谷，攀登山巔。</p>
<p>火種到手了，「邪惡」的世界乃歸於勇敢者，堅貞者，明識者，爭取光明者。</p>
<p>像蟄伏的蟲，默默地躲藏，「邪惡」並未絕跡。一有機會時，牠將乘隙而起，從泥土中，從樹根下。於是已死未滅的「邪惡」，勢將再生。人類歷史上，又重視龍與蛇的爭鬥。</p>
<p>不曾斬斷「邪惡」的根，因此「正義」永遠不能安寧。光明騰上天空，黑暗又悄悄爬上大地；「道德」纔稍稍疲倦，小丑乃欲扼之以死；航於大海中「公理」的小舟，殘暴的鱷魚時時想取來果脯。</p>
<p>「邪惡」永不改悔。往往姑息「邪惡」的人，不久便為邪惡所戕害。這時，助桀為虐者，邪惡幫兇者，阿諛者，殊不願再讚頌衰頹之正義，他們稱彼為：懦怯者，無能者，天演淘汰者。</p>
<p>「邪惡」披倡時，我們易受傳染與襲擊，因此我們想筑成一座正義的堡壘用以捍衛。</p>
<p>千萬年來，我們感於祖宗留下的堡壘，一半毀壞，一半也欠牢固，「邪惡」時時可能入侵。雖然我們一時把牠擊退了，但牠並未絕滅。為了長治久安，於是我們建起一個新的堡壘，更偉大，更堅固</p>
<p>搭起高高的木架，繫下長長的绳索，再運用千鈞的磬石，用力下衝沖。我們衝，衝，打樁，－打樁。給千萬年前，千萬年后的正義，打下一個基礎，深，厚，廣，永不動搖。</p>
<p>額上涔涔，手足也胼胝，這確實是一樁苦事。我們的前代不會做，我們的友人不曾做，多艱的我們卻以鐵似的雙肩來承擔了。</p>
<p>「假使自衛的話，那末感走『邪惡』為已足，你又何必在做一個更偉大，更堅固的堡壘呢？」有人譏笑我們太多事，不知取巧。但我們不管這些。我們甘願捨身，爭取永久的正義。庇及自身，更庇及友人；給自己的打算，更為我們的子孫。</p>
<p>不僅奠下更深厚的基礎，而且我們還須與「邪惡」短兵相接，廓清敗北的蟲沙，吹滅寒灰的星火。給千萬年來的宇宙，濾成一泓清水，剔去那些永遠的沉澱。</p>
<p>雖然我們前代也曾有過一個堡壘，也曾驅逐過「邪惡」，但現在堡壘已快傾圮了，「邪惡」仍未絕滅。過往的人過去了，帶走笑，帶走眼淚，晴天與陰天，悲哀與幸福，留下杜若的芳香，也留下蓬蒿的熏臭。「正義」的牆壁豎起了，「邪惡」的蛇乃又攪動，搖搖然，搖搖然。你不看見，封豕與長蛇，時時偷覬著我們，想一口吞下光明？你說，我們能再苟安嗎？</p>
<p>不是苟安，也不是退後的時候了。即使一星星火，也能夠燎原。「邪惡」埋藏的土地，那兒人類永遠不能安寧。</p>
<p>掘發了你那兒的埋藏；捕獲，毀滅你地下的「邪惡」；築起深厚堅牢的堡壘。為了別惡人，也為了你自己。</p>
<p>洗清千千萬萬年的宇宙，不留一點「邪惡」的渣滓。已死的腥腐，從「過往」墳墓中洗淨，遺孽的殘餘，我們再把「今天」的面具撕毀。</p>
<p>追奔逐被時，我們做先鋒；建築堡壘時，我們第一個高高舉起打樁的楚石。</p>
<p>撒下「正義」的種子，終有一日開花，為世界的人類祝福，我們來筑一個幸福的堡壘。</p>
<p>在前代「邪惡」並未絕滅，我們的工作勢須超過前代，使其永不再生。</p>
<h3>一波未平一波又起</h3>
<h3>希望</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>希望是全人類的最美麗的花朵，宇宙間最純淨的水，牠將世界上乾燥的空氣，和調得新鮮！</p>
<p>希望永久住在人們的心靈內，牠能替人家追求光明，牠不偷懶，不怕繁忙，艱難！</p>
<p>最欣悅的是希望之歌，那嘹亮的宏聲，震動了一切：</p>
<p>「我們的四周不會是死沉的，我麼有希望，能使發揚！」</p>
<p>焦灼的新，縷縷的愁思，陣陣的悲怨，祗要踏上希望之路，什麽都活躍了！</p>
<p>希望是無邊際的大海，希望是崇高的嶺巔，什麽都包羅著！</p>
<p>燃起希望之花，不是為了虛幻的黃金色的國土，桃花的溪源，那能使人發狂，牠們永遠與人類隔絕。無論至勇的冒險者，也探不到那個世界，那是一個誘惑！</p>
<p>我們的希望，是生存－人類最需要的。</p>
<p>我們有著希望，沒有等待，我麼要造成走向唯一的希望的道路，沒有遲疑，沒有懼怕！</p>
<p>這希望，是我們生命最珍貴的實物（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>悼吳梅</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>吳瞿安先生在滇南逝世，已經兩三個月了，各報追掉的文章，已有過好幾篇，十多天以前，國府又下令褒揚，特給卹金，一個老教授，到此地步，也可以說得身後哀榮了。我有幾個朋友，知道我和他有些交往的，都說，爲什麽我對於他的逝世，就默無一言呢？而且自由談上也從來沒有見過追悼他的文章呢？</p>
<p>的確，我在世界書局以五年的工夫，編好「全宋詞集」，共二百六十餘種，已經排版完竣，就待付印之外，又編好了「曲話集成」一種，計收集到曲話三十餘種，都已經校訂完畢，就請他為我作了一篇序，也承他加以推許。不料八一三礅聲一響，我和書局同人，急於從楊樹浦走出來，有許多稿件都沒有來得及攜帶，這五年來我的心血和書局的資本所結成的兩個鉅集，都只好留在大連瀟路的總廠裏；當然，他為「曲話集成」寫的序，也和夏　禪先生為「全宋詞集」寫的序一樣，於今都無從究詰了。爲了這些，於一般人為學術界又弱一個曲學大師而追掉他之外，我格外要追掉他。只是我為了忙，又心緒不寧，一直拖延著，沒有實現，這是使我自憾的。現在，總算填就了北曲一套，來追掉他，明知是班門弄斧，不足以當大雅，只是我既然是一片誠心，他又曾許我為曲之同嗜者，也許會來格來響吧。</p>
<p>吳先生諱梅，字　菴；後改瞿安，別號靈鸪和霜厓，蘇州人，最近幾年，擔任著中央大學的教授。著作有「風洞傳奇」，「血花飛傳奇」，「湘真閣傳奇」，「顧曲塵談」，「南北九宮簡譜」，「奢摩他室曲業」，「百豪嘉曲選」等。八一三後，他先避居蘇州鄉下木滇鎮，我的朋友顧雍如兄的家裏，後來中央大學在蜀復校，他就輾轉入蜀，又隨校入滇，以迄逝世，存年五十七歲。詳細的傳記，當然會有人做的，這裏只略提這些，以為下面悼詞的參證。</p>

<h3>對於「一學徒」及其同病者說和句話</h3>
<p>— （熾强）</p>
<p>最近有「一學徒」希望社會創辦函授學校，給他或他們忙裏愉閒讀一點書；這種求知慾的迫切，使我非常感動。誠如本刋編者先生之言：</p>
<p>「——我以爲創辦函授學校的問題倒還在其次，滬東公社的派調査員五十人，分赴各區商店，調査學徒的敎育程度，並懇求經理或店主允許他們的學徒求學，確是當務之急哩！」</p>
<p>如果辦到，這是「一學徒」或多數學徒的好消息。他們給你們去懇求經理或店主，將來你們的求知慾，或可打通難關於這一點「懇求」上。祇要店主經理的「允許」，宿願立刻可償。</p>
<p>這是一件千眞萬確的事情：店員學徒或中年失學者，處於文化中心的上海，平日耳濡目染，沒有一個不迫切地想到求知的重要，想是這樣想，而生活的魔爪，同時又緊緊地抓住他們的周遭。因此，腦筋要攝取一點精神食糧，還抵不住饑腸轆轆的來得難熬，知識的饑荒，充其量不過是患着貧血症或慢性的痼疾似的而已。能够忍得過去，變成渾渾噩噩，側身文盲行伍之間，也還不至於喪失生命！而麵包脫手，「七日不食則死」！古有明訓，良足畏懼！這是普通一班學徒在精神食糧和物質食糧兩股交幷的洪流下沒有處理淸楚的第一點！</p>
<p>其次，學徒期間中，在積習相沿之下，彷彿有點「賣身投靠」的情形。只有店，沒有學徒；只有廠家的自由，沒有學徒的自：只有店主經理擘畫經營和加速生產的自由，沒有學徒修養自己身心的自由，於是死生有命，滾蛋在天，「牛馬走」一輩子完事了！這是學徒在複雜的機構下不能達到求知慾望的又一點。</p>
<p>我們可以坦白地說，在店或廠家方面，似乎以學徒爲一件靈活的生財要具；而普通經理和店主，也大都熟悉「秦始皇愚民政策」的抱負。學徒護書的瞬間，便是機器停在那裏「如白駒過隙」的當口：統制經濟，自然暫時要宣吿脫鈎，而生產功能，豈容坐令動搖？不寗惟是，近墨者黑，茅塞一開，學徒慾望亢進：不是要求改善待遇，便是相率獨立營生，生產要件，中道斵喪。如若再招一批，不但生意眼上認爲大相背謬，即資本上也覺耗損，實屬太不合算。這是學徒要想讀書而店主經理不肯放膽給他們去嘗試，以致無從求知的又一點。</p>
<p>有這樣三點關係，學徒的求學，自然不得不懇求他們的店主或經理允許不可，所以認爲當務之急者，急在店主或經理的身上，關鍵在他們的答應或不答應而已。</p>
<p>現在願上海學徒，靜待母躁，讓敎育機關如滬東公社等派員調査，會得替你們去懇求或想辦法的。即上海公共租界工部局華人敎育處也本着這種救濟職工店員失學之之初衷，在界內辦有四個職工夜校，而且也常常帮助失學的學徒向他們的廠長店主經理懇求　大概是賢明白廠主居多，往往有求必應，欣然樂從。不過有些時候廠方加點「點心錢」之類於學徒的口袋裏而實行其加緊工作謀生產特別膨脹之秋，則請假畫之雪片紛飛，又是學徒們的「閒裏偷忙」的時候到門了。所以我以爲學徒的麵包和精神食糧，兩者都屬重要。捨精神食糧而專重　包，容易弄成渾渾噩噩，不識不知，而故步自封其業務的前程；至於捨麵包而逐精神食糧，則西風究不足以充饑！做到學徒，也只能兼籌並顧，從懇求和商量或允許之中，取得兩種食糧，國計民生，實利賴之，這話，不知學徒們中聽不中聽？</p>
<h3>讀史雜感</h3>
<p>— 林庚白</p>
<p>自報防秋急，江淮舉日非。九州龍戰始，一姓蟹行肥。轉徙空都邑，流亡有等威。師勞口亦敝，萬里合長圍。宵吁元戎事，淸流競竊鈎。不聞誅兩觀，惟是赦諸州。慷慨田橫血，悽凉馬稷頭。前軍方轉戰，幕府隱譙周！黨論舟中敵，縱橫媚竈多。眼穿回紇馬，淚盡洛陽駝。僕射元規塵，將軍越石戈。高光靈爽在，長護護漢山河！百輩鮮卑語，三都吉莫靴。乘軒紛使鶴，列陣枉爲鵝。江左酣王謝，山西仗牧頗。至今燕趙寇，不敢渡黃河！北府兵猶壯，西鄰使已窮。尙能依晋鄭，未可倚鬼戎。安內哀鼌錯，貪功誤呂蒙。低徊靑史恨，豈獨賣盧龍？巴蜀曾興漢，荊襄不保吳由來脣齒國，須切腹心圖。郢覆秦能復，丸亡楚亦孤。兵窮張赤幟，抉眼看東胡！不見朱夫子，空懐白鹿踪。衙官支半菽，處士享千鍾　世已無尼父，誰能問魯恭。明朝滄海上，天下正洶洶！（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂</p>
<p>這種引人出眼淚的戲劇，眞似金澹雲所說的：何必編那種悲劇，以敎人心中難過呢？然而因爲人是感情最深的動物，越是悲哀動人的戲劇，越是使人要看。有許多戲劇中事，明知是空中樓閣，並沒有這件事，只不過文人從意想中，從筆頭上造出來的。然而看到了那種生離死別的凄慘，悲壯哀艷的犧牲，憑你是聰明的人，也會掉下淚來。人家說：讀書時爲古人耽憂，現在看戲時，眞個替戲中人悲哀。譬如金澹雲說：何必這種悲劇，然而敎她不要看，她一定不肯。還有的自已好笑自己，爲什麽要流淚，眞是莫明其妙。而且今天這位林小姐，演得眞好，她的眼淚，不知從那裏米的，自然而然的眞的眼淚流個不止。因爲她是眞的眼淚，看戲的人，都陪了她的眼淚，眞是古人詩句中說的：「西廂紅淚怒於潮』咧。這戲演完了，已是十二點鐘時候，吳君素便招待朱愛人，金澹雲，何雙玉，儷王等到她屋子中來。依了君素的意思，難得她們都來了，明天是個星期日，要她們在這裏　桓一天。無奈朱愛人急於要陪何氏姊妹到自山村去，她趁着星期日那天是休息日，過了這天，又是要忙於工作了。愛人又把何氏姊妹要去相地建築織綢廠的事，的略和君素說了，她也十分高興。以爲何氏姊妹，旣然在此創興事業，我們可以時常聚首了。至於金澹雲一方面呢，她也急急於要回上海去。因爲蘇理雅太太，事無鉅細　，都要問密司金。金小姐不但是她的一位高等顧問，簡直是她的機要秘書咧。照着蘇理雅太太的意思，最好要請金澹雲辭去了國民外交委員會咐屬下的招待外賓之職，專門為她一人所聘任。可是金澹雲却不肯答應。她願意服務於公家，爲國家略盡一份子之責，却不願爲蘇理雅太太個人做事。雖然論起報酬來，蘇理　太太這方面，待遇要比現在的職司加優好幾倍咧。但是金澹雲却是存了爲國服務之心，而且國民外交委員會也不肯讓金小姐辭職的。幷且蘇理雅太太贈與了金小姐不少的資財，她也一槪謝絕，她說：自已足以够用，不需再得分外之財。（一〇五）</p>
<p>生活報告</p>
<h3>門市店的學徒</h3>
<p>— 志白</p>
<p>在前幾天的春秋欄裏，看到一篇一個學徒給編者先生的一封信，他聲述能够在晚上可以上義務學校的希望，關於他這一種要求，果然是不錯，但是在事實上恐仍有辦不到的地方，——允其是在門市店家。何况在一般祇顧圖利那管學徒們前途的老闆們手下呢？作者也是一個小職員，所以很能明瞭一般學徒平時的生活，因此寫述出來，希望老闆們能够允許學徒有求學的機會，不致埋沒他們的志願。一在普通的門市商號，每天早上七八點鐘才開門，然而一般烟紙店和糖果店，因爲要適應早市的需要，所以格外的開門得早一。像烟紙店，天一亮就有許多人來購買早點的餐菜和香烟，同時一般上小菜塲的大司務娘姨等，也都來兌換錢幣，以便去買他們所辦的飯菜。像糖果店，是適應一般上寫字間的職員，和進學校的學生們，來買一些麵包白脫油牛奶等，所以也非早不可的，更其是廠家送麵包的人，特別的早，因此一般學徒們都要特別早起，把店門拉開來，並且還要掃地，揩檯凳，和整理貨物，——這也是理應的事。</p>
<p>其餘的店家本來當這時候是他們練字的晨光，但是在烟紙店和糖果店，爲了忙的原因，自然生意要緊了，更其有一般貪懶的老闆娘娘，有時候還要呌他們去買小菜燒飯。一到下午，更是上市最熱鬧的時候，他們簡直照這樣忙碌一直要到晚上十一二點鐘。允共是夏天的糖果店中，到夜間仍是要送貨，因爲到了晚上，購買汽水啤酒的人，特別的多，所以一般學徒們，更其沒有自修的機會了！唉！他們所學到的究竟是什麼呢？同時一般老闆們也不諒解，不肯多僱一個老司務。寗出少些的代價，喚學徒們担任着這種份外的工作。因此一般學徒們，祇有永遠在自私的經理和老闆們壓迫下呻吟着！</p>
<p>現在作者的生活雖比學徒們好一些，可是要有自修的時間，已在精疲力盡的下午十時以後，並且還耍受着不少波折，所以我懇求一般資本家，不要爲了一己之私，來妨礙學徒們的前途，至少要想出一個辦法來，使他們有自修或上夜校的時間。</p>
<h3>關於懸旗的一個意見</h3>
<p>— 謀</p>
<p>前些時爲了懸掛國旗，一度發生誤會，後經市商會和納稅華人會與兩租界當局商定，每年懸旗八决，問題才算解決。前天（五月五日）是總理就任非常大總統，革命政府成立紀念日，也是上項非正式協定成立後第一個規定懸旗的紀念日。淸晨出去，便可看見國旗到處飄揚，莊嚴美麗，這一方面表現出市民愛國熱衷，另一方而也大足激厲人心。</p>
<p>要知道國旗乃所以代表國家，我們尊敬國家，因之也尊敬國旗，我們愛護國家，因之也愛護國旗；淸晨我們很恭敬地將他升上去，傍晚便應很恭敬地降下，妥爲收藏。但是，五日晚上，的摸八點半鐘光景，我上街購物，却見許多商店仍將國旗掛着，或許他們爲了以前被迫卸旗，含蓄着無限的悲憤，能有掛旗的日子，就掛個暢快了，但是爲了尊敬國旗，我們該應在晚上卸下的。我有鑒於此，所以特借貴刋一角之地，指出此種錯誤，希望全市商家注意及之。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>不自由的婚姻</h3>
<p>— （佛）</p>
<p>現在靑年的婚姻制度，是自由的，用不着父母之命，媒妁之言，惟有舊式的家庭，則當在例外。</p>
<p>現有某靑年，見某摩登女子而悅之，兩情繾綣，形影相隨，但女欲訂白頭之盟，結婚姻之的，則某靑年拒之，日有隔壁老伯伯在，此約不可訂也，聞者必定詫為奇談。</p>
<p>靑年婚姻問題，因父母之干涉，不能達其目的，因而自殺者有之矣，我未聞恐怕隔壁老伯伯欲干涉，而不敢訂約也。有之目張先生始</p>

<h3>怎樣來復與昆曲</h3>
<p>— 杏書</p>
<p>希望梅畹華登高一呼</p>
<p>昆曲人人知道是中國戲劇之精粹，他有高雅的詞句，悠揚的音樂；細膩的表情；梅蘭芳當年在美國演刺虎頗成功，而演平劇的亦都以有昆曲根底者為優！這樣昆曲理應很興盛。可是事實卻並不如此，如碩果僅存的仙溺社，去年出演於東方書場，最近出演於仙藥戲院，營業均甚慘淡，演技不亞於平劇第一流名角，票價又甚低廉，而觀客始終不見擁擠，舉申趣，紹興文戲，常及錫文戲相較，竟可說有天壤之別，這到底是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>大多數人總說昆曲『曲高和寡』，『字句深奧』，這話固然不錯，但愚意以為這並非主要原因，譬如平劇，聽客都能夠懂得嗎？恐怕未必。鄙人選算能夠哼幾句，可是除了熟戲之外，說句良心話，也不過看看　而已。況且以道白而論，昆曲之道白，大多數為蘇白，蘇滬一帶的人，應當比京白更易瞭解，何至不能引人注意，愚見以為幾點原因，頗有研究之價值。</p>
<p>缺少佈景</p>
<p>看戲看戲總逃不了看字，面對著美麗悅目的佈景，當然比對這平淡無奇的一塊黃板，來得舒適。記得有一次去看周信芳君的華麗緣，內中插一段昆曲，台上裝著極美麗的佈景，把滿院電燈減了，放射著優美的弧光燈，白的雪花從上面飄下來，王西春披著朱紅的披風，在笛聲悠揚中，與周君對唱了一段昆曲，頓時全院鴉雀無聲，下場後贊美不已，假定遊園驚夢也來這一場好佈景，恐怕功效也　相同的。</p>
<p>缺少服裝</p>
<p>服裝在常人，亦有相當重要，何況乎演戲，假定叫梅蘭芳穿了一件破衣服做戲，恐怕也沒有什麽好看吧。</p>
<p>缺少宣傳</p>
<p>宣傳時不可缺少的一椿事情，試問社會上的事有那一偆是不宣傳而能轟動的，平角那一個不是到上海捧紅的，仙霓社就是缺少宣傳缺少捧場。</p>
<p>缺少比較</p>
<p>俗語說得好，『不識貨，貨比貨』，凡物不此，不見高低，假定劇團程劇團，沒有旁的戲班子同他們比，一年到頭在上海做買五毛錢，恐怕人們也覺得『司空見慣不足為奇』，現在就只有這樣一個仙霓社，唱得無論怎樣好，無從去比較了。</p>
<p>上面的歲點缺點，救之之道，全在經濟，仙霓社員諸君。都係清寒出身，生活尚生問題，何況其他，至於再創辦如平劇之科班，多授新弟子，這工作，又有誰肯做呢？當初穆藕初先生化可了幾萬塊錢。好容易訓練出現在仙霓社這班社員，但是在現在，有力量的，輕而易舉，亦是『養不容辭』來做這複雜昆曲的工作，以愚之見，只有梅蘭芳梅博士一人了，他是現在中國的戲劇大王，他來提倡中國戲劇之精粹，這不是應當的么，義不容辭的未以張傳芳之技藝，亦何以不能替畹華配斷橋呢，如果能得畹華登高一呼，則昆曲復與有日矣。</p>

<h3>看縮本「花濺淚」</h3>
<p>— 維克</p>
<p>藍蘭比以前好得多　無界姊妹們都在座</p>
<p>在「花濺淚」上加縮本兩個字，似乎很滑稽，但實際上上海劇藝社的確是「縮本」演出的。原來「花濺淚」一共有五幕演不出，只演到第四幕，而這星期日上午上海劇藝社在新光實驗劇務場演，由上午十時到上午十二時，短短的兩小時半間，即使演四幕也不可能，於是劇藝社就來一次「縮本」演出：截頭去尾，只留中段，把第一幕裁去，只演中間二三兩慕，現在讓我拉拉雜雜談一點演出的情形吧。</p>
<p>這一次，在這兩慕中間，我們發見了許多改正的地方。單拿演員講，藍蘭的來來，比過去得好得多，他念詩的時候，聲音也提高，眼睛也放在那詩篇上了；聽實話的時候，耳機也貼緊在耳朵上了，動作也沉著得多。尤其是第三幕，她準備唱拉沙爾樂水自殺那場，表示米米自殺前紛亂，痛苦心理狀態利用許多小動作，很好。</p>
<p>譬如燈光漸黯，輕柔的音樂聲起來，米米倒出她手皮包裹所有的脂粉，口紅，懷着迷茫，悽愴的性情，，站到鏡子面前，照照這還年青，相當漂亮的臉袋與身材，......不是很可愛麼？當她第一次預備唱拉沙爾的時候，突然外面撒進一大把嚮導社彩色紙片，使米米嚇得大聲驚問是誰？這不比從前可愛得多麼？當她站到窗口悽離的流着淚，（這一個動作做得還不夠）她順手拿窗帷揩揩眼淚，然後（臉部陰黯的）由窗口就伸出手慢慢的走進桌邊去拿倒好的拉沙爾杯子，......這恐怖的情緒與氣氛還不夠麼　　以前洪謨演的大來銀行買辦常海才，換了舒湮來演，他的動作變化比洪謨多，但他却有一個缺點，就是肩膀與身體聳動得太厲害。</p>
<p>蒙納的米米的媽媽，還是個討好的角色，觀眾照樣很歡喜她那種粗俗的脾氣，發出大聲的轟笑，但是文明戲氣味還是十足。</p>
<p>夏霞張婉君，徐立，屠廣　，丁芝，都保持過去的成績。兩慕前後插有兩次音樂，這助長劇中氣氛不少。</p>
<p>這天上演，舞女界預備串演的舞女，如楊文英，韋楚蕓，方莉莉等都在，聽說她們的戲，下月才可以公演。</p>
<h3>移風劇社　舉辦登記</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>名伶周信芳領導之移風劇社，自隸演卡爾登大戲院以來，口碑載道，深得觀眾之信仰，許為海上唯一前進與完善之劇團。現該社為使組織更臻鞏固與健全，已籌備向　政府舉辦登記，開平劇團之先河。信芳近對人表示，移風社表演，　在青黃不接之階段中，故劇本尚須新舊具備，俾不背時代之進化及迎合觀眾之口味。至相當時期，方克通盤改革，庶免欲速不達之虞云。信芳慘淡經營，於此一端，即可概見。關心平劇前途命運者，宜如何加以擁護而督促之耶？</p>
<h3>劉琴心之小放牛劇照</h3>
<p>— 星岩</p>
<p>近日花衫人材鼎盛男伶中祗小翠花，毛世來，小桂花數人。坤伶中北方不多見，海上僅于素蓮近頗努力研習。此外尚有一劉琴心者，為劉玉琴弟子，對花旦戲頗有根底，且蹻工穩健，尤屬難能可貴。綠花旦戲多穿襖褲，非蹂蹺不足以顯示婀娜之態與婷婷玉立之美也。即如「小放牛」一劇，中有許多身段，若不踩蹺，即不易美觀。晚年各名旦往往以本人不擅蹻工，因　極力提倡廢除。此則未免貽削足就履之譏矣。</p>
<h3>代郵</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>晚萸先生：影圈拾趣續稿請寄來，勿寫號數，以便選用，每天刊出，勢所難能。</p>
<p>燕南先生：示悉。承謬獎，愧不敢當。尊書應改黑色，否則不能製版，並請於每晚九時後到館一談。</p>
<p>星野先生：義賣獻金定本週實行，望諸同文一致參加，獻金總數擬下月初公開發表。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>紀軍閥慘殺優伶的殘暴行為</p>
<p>前敘伶人身價抬高的原因，多由於北伐前軍閥政客的熱烈捧架；但是其中也有幾個武人是最痛惡梨園行人的，一位是作過吉林督軍的孟恩遠，一位九時直隸督辦褚玉璞。孟曾活埋秦腔名伶元元紅（名魏聯　，非老元元紅郭賓臣。）褚曾槍斃鬚生三魁，劉漢臣，（非現方出演天蟾舞台的武生劉漢臣，此劉漢臣，原名八歲紅。已死之劉漢臣，童年時代擋在九畝地新舞台出演，唱學潘月樵，據云係潘之義子，與劉文魁皆劉文美兄弟行。）該兩事的起因，全是由於姦情，並且都與他們的姨太太有很大的關係。孟本係撈毛的出身，（撈毛即王八）所以某年值他誕辰的時候，有一人送上一個錦，打開一瞧，裹面却是一把粗磁燒成的大茶壺，上面並且寫着「大茶壺孟恩遠」六個大字，當時同着許多賓客，真把他氣得要死。據說他的那位如夫人，也就是窯姐出身，後來同元元紅發生了戀愛，孟聞知後，竟將元元紅捉來活埋的究竟他與她當初戀愛的起點是誰找的誰？因為遠在東北，兼以事隔二十馀載，所以社會人士都莫能探悉其中真相。至於褚玉璞槍殺劉高兩伶之事，距今不過十數寒暑，而且這件事又近在中外觀瞻所繫的天津。褚氏雖歿，而當日勾引劉高二人的女主角還活在世上，因此關於這樁事的始末詳情，不佞却早已探得備細，現在特為把它敘述出來，以來替冤死的優伶稍鳴不平，二則藉此也可以暴露軍閥時代一般武人的殘忍好殺，一意孤行，正所謂「愛之欲其生，惡之欲其死，」捧唱戲的也是他們，殺伶人的也是他們。這種胡鬧的行徑，比較今日蔣公領導之下愛國將領，矢忠黨國，以熱血捍衛國土，俱曾受過高深訓練，祗知以國事為前提者，其賢不肖直不可以道里計也。六）</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops on Various Fronts in Central Jiangxi, Southern Hubei, and Northern Hunan Gain Strategic Initiative; Japanese Fiercely Attack Xianghua Road Without Success; Fierce Fighting Near Fengle River; Japanese Troops in Chongyang East Swept Away; Tongcheng Surrounded by Chinese Troops; Nanchang City Breached Once, Japanese Now Counterattacking in Three Routes, Chinese Troops Advancing in Two; Japanese Troops in Pengze Displaying Signs of Wavering</h3>
<p>(Changsha) Since the Chinese troops launched offensives on the fronts of Central Jiangxi, Southern Hubei, and Northern Hunan, more than ten days have passed, and nearly fifty major and minor battles have been fought. Significant results have been achieved in both strategy and tactics. First, the Japanese plan to transfer troops to invade Northern Hunan has been thwarted by the Chinese offensives. Second, in each battle, Chinese troops have been able to exchange small sacrifices for great victories, with the total gains exceeding Chinese consumption and casualties by more than twofold. Third, each Chinese offensive has managed to seize the initiative, engaging the Japanese everywhere, causing them to be overwhelmed, exhausted, and unable to retaliate. Fourth, each area attacked by the Chinese is a vital point for the Japanese, often causing them significant losses and threats. One particular characteristic is that the Chinese troops' coordination of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare has become increasingly sophisticated in this offensive, with a tendency to transition from guerrilla tactics to regular field army tactics. Therefore, although the Chinese troops are not currently seeking to quickly occupy points, they are sometimes willing to defend occupied areas with all their might at certain times. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) Japanese troops on the Xianghua Road have launched fierce attacks on the Chinese side. After the Chinese troops' courageous resistance, the Japanese have so far failed to succeed.

In the Zhongxiang area, Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting near the Fengle River. There has only been minor contact on the front of the Hanyi Road. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: A certain Chinese unit has swept away the Japanese troops in Xintang City, east of Chongyang, and Baini Bridge has been surrounded again by the Chinese. On the morning of the fifth, Japanese Major General Sugiyama led over a thousand soldiers to launch a fierce attack on the Zhongjiao Beishimiao area of the Chinese side, attempting to break through. The Chinese troops bravely counterattacked, and the battle was extremely fierce. By noon on the sixth, several hundred Japanese troops had been killed, and the battle was still intensely ongoing. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) On the morning of the first, over five hundred Japanese troops moving from Chang'an Station to Zhongfang were surrounded and fiercely attacked by a certain Chinese unit in the southeastern Xiangshan area. By noon on the fifth, they had all been annihilated. On the morning of the fourth, a certain Chinese unit launched a fierce attack on Tongcheng, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops on the outskirts of the city. The Chinese troops charged through the rain of bullets, and by midnight, nearly a thousand Japanese troops had been killed. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand and retreated into the city to resist stubbornly. On the morning of the fifth, the Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on the city walls. The artillery battle between the two sides was extremely intense. All Chinese units have advanced to the vicinity of Tongcheng, and Tongcheng is currently surrounded by Chinese troops and is under heavy attack. (Eighth dispatch)</p>

<p>Fuliang: On the morning of the seventh, Chinese troops launched a large-scale offensive on Pengze County in two routes. One route approached Shuangfengjian (one kilometer south of Pengze), and the other route once occupied Jianshan (five kilometers east of Pengze). Fierce fighting is still ongoing near Jianshan and Shuangfengjian. The Japanese troops in Pengze are already showing signs of wavering. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese troops in the Nanchang area are no more than half a mile away from Nanchang. According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops did break into the city two days ago and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese troops. Furthermore, the Japanese strongholds of Shen (transliteration) Kou and Longwangmiao, east of Nanchang, have been completely captured by the Chinese troops.

(Seventh dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: At dawn on the sixth, Chinese troops once attacked Hongmen Bridge in Nanchang, but the Japanese troops reinforced, and the Chinese troops retreated to Guangyang Bridge.

(Eighth dispatch)</p>
<p>Shanggao: On the sixth, the Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on Zhuyuan Hucun, north of Gao'an.

<p>Pingjiang: On the sixth, over a thousand Japanese troops launched a counterattack on Nanlin Bridge. After being intercepted by the Chinese troops, the exhausted Japanese soldiers were eventually defeated by the elite Chinese troops. The Japanese troops in Chongyang Tongcheng are still under heavy siege by the Chinese troops. (Seventh dispatch)</p>
<p>Zaoyang: The Chinese troops on the front line east of Gaocheng Yinjiadian deliberately created a large gap to lure the Japanese deep into the area. A Japanese regiment fell into the Chinese trap, and the Chinese troops then surrounded and attacked. The Chinese troops annihilated over a thousand Japanese troops and seized many spoils of war, which are currently being inventoried. (Seventh dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: At 7:00 a.m. on the fifth, three to four thousand Japanese troops with over twenty cannons southwest of Fengxin launched a counterattack on the Chinese besieging troops. The Chinese troops calmly responded and, after holding out for two hours, the Japanese troops were eventually pushed back. In the past two days, the fighting in the Fengxin area has become quieter. (Seventh dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Qi and Ji Mutiny in Succession</h3>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The puppet troops of Liu Yuchun's unit, numbering two to three hundred, stationed in Hong County, mutinied there on the 27th of last month, executing four puppet advisors and annihilating all the puppet troops in Qi County. The puppet organizations were all destroyed, and they surrendered to a certain Chinese unit. Furthermore, the puppet troops of Li Zhongcai's unit in Ji County, numbering over three hundred, also completely mutinied on the 26th of last month. All Japanese and puppet advisors were executed. Currently, the trend of mutiny is extremely prevalent in the area, and the Chinese troops' momentum is immense, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. (Eighth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xin Street Recaptured by Chinese Troops, Tensions in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Advance South Along Yuehan Road; Fierce Land and Air Battles Along Xinhe Road; Bai Chongxi Sends More Guangxi Troops to Counterattack</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news: A large force of Chinese troops is currently advancing south along the Yuehan Road, only three miles away from Guangzhou. Xin Street, the fourth station north of Guangzhou on the Yuehan Road, was also recaptured by Chinese troops yesterday. At the same time, Chinese guerrilla teams attacked the Japanese troops in the suburbs of Guangzhou, causing sudden tensions in the city and plunging it into chaos. From Ninyang, Xinkai, Xinhe, Jiang, and Fo, Chinese and Japanese troops have been engaged in fierce land and air battles on the sixth and seventh. Bai Chongxi has sent more Guangxi troops to join the counterattack. (Eighth afternoon 10 p.m. special dispatch)</p>
<p>Xueqing: Since the Japanese suffered a crushing defeat in the Zhu Liuhe battle, their westward invasion plot has been shattered.

The Japanese have concentrated all their forces in the Jiangmen area and have been continuously shelling the Xinhe highway in the past two days, attempting to block the Chinese troops' advance. (Seventh dispatch)</p>
<p>(Gyeongju) The Chinese guerrillas who broke into Guangzhou have already withdrawn. As a result, the Japanese troops have lifted the curfew.

Last Saturday, Chinese guerrillas infiltrated Guangzhou City, and the Japanese troops immediately ordered a curfew and took emergency measures on various streets. (Eighth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Responsible parties here do not believe the rumors of street fighting in Guangzhou. It is claimed that this statement undoubtedly originated from the Chinese announcement of the capture of Xin Street, north of Guangzhou, and the announcement of a curfew in Guangzhou on Sunday. Since the Japanese troops occupied Guangzhou, they have announced curfews several times, with the sole purpose of eliminating thieves and other troublemakers. (Eighth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Japanese Consul General Okazaki here formally denied to a Reuters reporter today the rumors of street fighting and that Chinese guerrillas had reached the outskirts of Guangzhou. He claimed that there were no regular Chinese troops or guerrillas within at least thirty miles of Guangzhou. The rumors of street fighting in Guangzhou were likely due to yesterday's curfew. Yesterday, rumors circulated that armed Chinese guerrillas had been discovered in the city, so a curfew was implemented, but after a thorough search of the city, no armed Chinese were found. Those arrested were only suspected robbers. After the curfew was lifted, foreigners walking in the city did not see any panic among the residents, nor were there any unusual security measures taken by Japanese soldiers in the streets. (Eighth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Huiyang: Two Chinese units in the vicinity of Shilong have been launching daily attacks since the 25th of last month, with repeated gains.

<h3>Epidemic Spreads on Weizhou Island, Many Japanese Soldiers Die</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Since Weizhou Island was occupied by the Japanese troops, an epidemic has spread. Many Japanese officers and soldiers have died from the disease.

<h3>Japanese Troops Suffer Losses in Fuyang</h3>
<p>Jinhua: At dawn on the seventh, over four hundred Japanese troops from Fuyang invaded the Chinese Hunan Mountain, Zhujialing, and Niushan areas in three routes.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Shandong Enter Dezhou City; Japanese Puppet Agencies Burned to the Ground</h3>
<p>(Zhengzhou) On the 27th of last month, a certain unit of Chinese troops in Northern Shandong suddenly used rapid and secret actions to pass through the Japanese defense line, launched a fierce attack on Dezhou, and charged into the city, killing countless Japanese soldiers.

Under the intense artillery fire of the Japanese troops, the Chinese officers and soldiers bravely charged and killed. At 3:00 p.m., the Japanese troops were unable to withstand and fled west. The Chinese troops took advantage of the situation to pursue and completely fled back to the vicinity of Qu Ting, looting and burning along the way. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and the Chinese troops also suffered over twenty casualties. (Eighth dispatch)</p>

In the eastern Shanxi area, about two thousand Japanese troops have been killed, and together with the Heilongguan and Jingle areas, the number is over ten thousand. (Seventh dispatch)</p>
<h3>Lu Rian Arrested and Brought to Justice</h3>
<p>Jinhua: Lu Rian, the traitorous Jiang Zhe Overseas Pacification Envoy, was supported by the Japanese and had been causing trouble in the Zhejiang coastal area for a long time. He had been pursued and arrested many times without success. Recently, Lu Rian returned from Shanghai to Cuo Shan on a Japanese warship, gathering over a thousand bandits to plot an attack on the Zhejiang border, and three Japanese warships provided cover for him.

<h3>From the "Twenty-One Demands" to the "New Order in East Asia"</h3>
<p>— Commemorating the Anti-Japanese War and Canceling "May Ninth" —</p>
<p>Today is once again "May Ninth." Twenty-four years ago, the world was in a frenzy of war, engaging in the re-division of the world. At that time, Yuan Shikai, a feudal remnant who controlled Chinese politics, was dreaming of becoming an emperor. Japan, therefore, believed that this was a "once in a lifetime" opportunity to carry out its long-planned invasion of China, in order to realize its long-standing fantasy of dominating the Far East. It first used the pretext of declaring war on Germany to send troops to attack Qingdao, occupying Shandong. Subsequently, under the pretext that China's request for troop withdrawal was an insult to Japan, the Japanese Minister to China, Hioki Eki, suddenly presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai. The content is divided into five groups: the first group of articles demanded the inheritance of Germany's rights in Shandong and the expansion of Japanese influence; the second group of articles allowed Japan to gain a monopoly position in Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia; the third group of articles made the Daye Iron Mine and Pingxiang Coal Mine jointly owned by China and Japan; the fourth group directly sought to annex the entire territory of China, prohibiting others from interfering; the fifth group of articles, such as hiring advisors, was even more of a condition that treated China as a Japanese protectorate. In short, these Twenty-One Demands were completely the shackles of Japan's attempt to destroy China. However, Yuan Shikai was mired in the dream of imperial restoration and dared not refuse outright, secretly entrusting such a major matter to one or two diplomats to negotiate with Japan in secret. At this point, Japan naturally did not relax its grip, and on May 7, 1915, presented Yuan Shikai with an ultimatum, requiring a response by the ninth. Yuan Shikai, on the morning of May 9, ordered Cao Rulin to send a reply to the Japanese legation, agreeing to all but the fifth group of items. If it were not for the passionate opposition of the Chinese people and the righteous intervention of the international community, Yuan Shikai's reply would almost have become an ironclad case of selling out China's sovereignty and interests.</p>
<p>Invading China is a traditional Japanese policy, and the "Twenty-One Demands" can be said to be the first major revelation of Japan's ambition towards China. For twenty-four years, Japan's aggression against China has never ceased for a single day, but has changed its form from time to time depending on the international environment and the internal situation in China. When the international balance of power was stable and the Chinese people's movement was active, Japan took the opportunity to advance slowly, as exemplified by the situation around the Washington Conference. When the international balance of power was shaken or destroyed, and the Chinese people's movement was relatively sluggish, Japan would advance headlong, and the "September 18th" Incident in 1931 was launched under these circumstances.</p>
<p>When the world was in the midst of an economic panic in 1929, the great powers were overwhelmed and unable to care for themselves. Japan seized this opportunity to act freely in the Far East, using the Wanbaoshan Incident as a test, and the reaction was lukewarm. Finally, on September 18, 1931, the Beida Camp incident was launched. In a few days, the fertile three northeastern provinces of China, and thirty million Chinese people, fell into the hands of the Japanese army. At that time, Japan was "proud and satisfied," and elated. Therefore, it tried its best to expand the incident. On January 28, 1932, the Shanghai Incident broke out. Although it lasted only a month, the Chinese army finally retreated, but the heroic achievements of the Chinese army broke the general pessimism of the Chinese people and shifted the international psychology towards Japan.</p>
<p>Aggressors are "never satisfied." Seeing China's internal disunity and the international community's complacent peace, Japan marched into Shanhaiguan in January 1933, occupied Rehe in March, and captured various passes of the Great Wall. Since Japan's military actions were successful step by step, it simply demanded to annex the entire China. On April 17, 1934, the obscure Tiani made a statement, openly excluding the interests of European and American countries, and even treating China as a Japanese protectorate. Although this type of statement has absolutely no legal standing and his intention was merely to test the international community, the statement exposed his ambitions and proved the hypocrisy of various diplomatic rhetoric before and after.</p>
<p>Thus, from the "September 18th" Incident, the "January 28th" Incident, to the Great Wall War of Resistance, China always tolerated in many ways. Japan thought that bayonets could scare China, and it stepped up its pressure on China step by step. However, there is a limit to tolerance. The Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, 1937, finally aroused the heroic resistance of the Chinese army. The cannons of "August 13" opened the massive curtain of China's all-out war of resistance. This had long been seen by international observers and repeatedly warned, but was probably unexpected by the Japanese side!</p>
<p>Now, China and Japan have been at war for over ten months: China's bloody struggle has entered a new stage. Although China has lost many cities, the morale and fighting spirit of the Chinese front, and the increasingly favorable domestic and foreign conditions possessed by China, stand in stark contrast to Japan. The Japanese side has also seen the determination of China's resistance and the unity of the national will, and cannot help but feel panic and trepidation. Therefore, while continuing its military operations, it is also working hard on political conspiracies and diplomatic activities, and the so-called New Order in East Asia is a smokescreen for political diplomacy!</p>
<p>The international community will never be deceived by the "New Order in East Asia." The notes from countries such as Britain, the United States, and France to Japan have made a clear denial. On the Chinese side, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has directly revealed its hidden intentions, pointed out sharply: "What kind of evil intentions are contained under the seven words of building a new order in East Asia? In simple terms, this is a total name for overturning the international order in East Asia, creating a slave China, in order to achieve its ambition of dominating the Pacific and dividing the world." Every Chinese person knows that because of the international torch of justice shining outside and the leader leading the national policy of resistance and construction inside, Japan, no matter what attractive slogans it shouts or what good-looking banners it displays, will not stop until it has destroyed China or exhausted its own aggression. Therefore, it is well known that China must resist to the end. This belief of the Chinese government and the people is by no means created by China and those who sympathize with China by calling on each other with any sophistry, nor can it be shaken by sophistry that destroys China.</p>
<p>From the "Twenty-One Demands" to the "New Order in East Asia," the whole world has seen Japan's step-by-step intensification of its aggression against China. The so-called "New Order in East Asia" is actually a continuation and expansion of the "Twenty-One Demands." The historical lessons and bloody lessons of Japan's aggression against China over the past twenty-four years have finally awakened the 450 million people of China. Today, China's war of resistance is a positive response to "May Ninth" and "May Seventh" and the "Twenty-One Demands," replacing "May Ninth." In the past, Chinese society commemorated "May Ninth" with sorrow and tears; now, Chinese troops are canceling "May Ninth" with heroism and iron blood. The international community showed empty words of sympathy in the past, but the international community is providing practical assistance today!</p>
<h3>A Japanese Plane Conducts Night Reconnaissance Over Chongqing</h3>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Artillery Remains Silent, Residents Spend Entire Night in Trenches, Authorities Properly Plan Relief for Refugees</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The government is making every effort to assist refugees from occupied cities. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang are deeply concerned and have resolved to provide maximum assistance. The relief efforts are currently being managed by the Relief Committee and the Chongqing Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Office. It is reported that the central government has decided to allocate three million yuan for relief expenses, of which one million yuan has already been allocated. Plans are also in place to raise the remaining two million yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding relief measures, the government has established dozens of refugee reception centers to specifically accommodate refugees who have lost their homes due to Japanese air raids. After a short rest at the reception centers, the government will transfer them to various counties, mainly by waterway, supplemented by highway. The authorities have dispatched personnel to various counties to find housing. If there are no vacant houses, new houses will be built for the refugees to live in after the evacuation. The government will also provide refugees with all necessary expenses. Upon evacuation, each person, regardless of age or gender, will receive an evacuation allowance of one yuan. After departure, each person will receive one yuan per day for food and lodging until they reach their destination. Upon arrival, impoverished refugees who are unable to support themselves will receive a monthly allowance of four yuan to maintain their livelihood, for a period of three months. At the same time, the government has decided to find a way to solve the long-term living problems of the refugees. Relief agencies are planning to cooperate with central production agencies to organize production projects to provide employment for the refugees. It is reported that these relief measures apply not only to the victims but also to ordinary citizens who voluntarily evacuate to various counties. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Shortly after midnight last night, the air raid siren blared, and Chongqing residents spent the entire night in air raid shelters. At 00:30, a Japanese plane was seen flying towards Chongqing, triggering the first alert. At 01:05, the Japanese plane appeared closer to Chongqing, and the emergency alarm was sounded. However, the Japanese bomber did not come here, and the all-clear was not sounded until 04:45 this morning. According to reports from Chinese officials, a Japanese plane lingered over Chongqing for a long time, clearly for reconnaissance purposes. The Chinese side turned on searchlights, but the anti-aircraft artillery did not fire. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the latest official announcement, the total number of casualties from the bombings of Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th is currently 3,500. There are still bodies buried in the rubble. The number of dead and wounded are roughly equal. From May 5th to 7th, the government facilitated the evacuation of a total of 200,000 refugees. This does not include those who evacuated on foot, by rickshaw, or by sedan. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the two bombings of Chongqing, a new way of life has been implemented. Most banks have changed their office hours to 7:00 to 9:00 AM, and government offices begin work after 2:00 PM. Stores have also decided to stop business from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. At the same time, the government has ordered all stores to resume business after 4:00 PM to allow the public to buy food. An Associated Press reporter walked one and a half miles today and confirmed that one-third of the city had been destroyed, and there were only 200 people in the bombed area. Workers are busy excavating charred corpses. In addition, the government plans to move six hospitals outside the city to avoid accidental losses during Japanese bombings. The injured are first transferred to hospitals in the city for first aid and then transferred to hospitals outside the city for surgery. According to an Associated Press reporter quoting personnel from the New Life Movement, the organization plans to establish "industrial camps" to help the affected workers. All products from the "industrial camps" will be transported to the General Chamber of Commerce for sale. In addition, grocery stores will be set up to provide refugees with work, and residents can also purchase various supplies. Workers can earn one and a half yuan per day. The grocery stores are located on the highway outside the city leading to Chengdu. Since the bombing of Chongqing, the New Life Movement has been providing food to 30,000 refugees every day. The most interesting and touching thing is the clinic set up by the government in the YMCA, where the injured receive five to twenty yuan, depending on the severity of the injury. The families of the deceased receive thirty yuan each. Foreign correspondents residing in Chongqing will form a "laundry cooperative." All foreign correspondents must participate in the laundry work, as the laundry workers have left Chongqing to seek refuge. Even more comically, when the laundry workers left the city, they took away all the clothes, including underwear, entrusted to them by foreigners, leaving most foreigners with only the coats on their backs.

<h3>Central Government Remains in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Relocation Rumors Untrue</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Rumors spread by the Japanese that the Chinese government has moved from Chongqing to Chengdu are absolutely untrue. According to reliable sources, the Chinese government will remain in Chongqing. Most administrative agencies will be dispersed in the countryside outside the city, but not far away, allowing close contact with each other. The British Consulate Office has moved to the south bank of the Yangtze River, and the German and French consulates have also moved to the western suburbs. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, flew to Chengdu on Saturday, but according to reliable sources, the ambassador's trip is absolutely unrelated to the bombing of Chongqing. He had intended to visit Chengdu some time ago, and arrangements were made before the bombing. According to a Reuters reporter in Chengdu, the British Ambassador arrived in Chengdu on May 6th as planned and inspected the beautiful campus of the West China Union University on the day of the annual sports meet. The universities participating in the sports meet included West China University, Nanjing University, Ginling College, National Central University, and Cheeloo University.

<h3>British-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations Reach Critical Juncture British Ambassador Submits Proposal to Molotov Soviet Union Tells Britain Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The British Ambassador Seeds had a 40-minute meeting with Molotov today. The results were not disclosed. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) British Ambassador Sir William Seeds is scheduled to visit the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, this afternoon to personally deliver his country's counter-proposal regarding the formation of an anti-aggression group. It is said to advocate (1) the Soviet Union providing security guarantees to its neighboring countries unilaterally, (2) Britain providing assistance if the country is drawn into a war vortex due to fulfilling the guarantee. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the British government has telegraphed its further expressions to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to be forwarded to the Soviet government. It is not appropriate to make public statements while conducting this diplomatic exchange of views. A member asked whether the government intends to strive for full cooperation with the Soviet Union to build a system based on mutual guarantees to resist aggression from any party. The Prime Minister replied that the government's current policy aims to achieve full cooperation with the Soviet Union. Labor member Fletcher asked whether the Soviet policy would be affected by the change of foreign minister. The Prime Minister said that this could not be answered definitively. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Labor leader Attlee, denying that the government's procedures for obtaining national security had been delayed in any way. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons meeting today, Conservative member Boothby asked whether the Prime Minister knew that the majority of the British people advocated a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, given the guarantees Britain had given to Poland and Romania, and the increasing concern among the public that future necessary steps to fulfill these guarantees might not be possible. Would the Prime Minister issue an assurance stating that he would do his best to conclude a treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as soon as possible? The Prime Minister replied that he was unaware that the British people had the opportunity to express such opinions to a greater extent than Mr. Boothby had just stated. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A Daily Telegraph correspondent in Moscow reported that there was an optimistic opportunity for the agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union on the European political situation. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Seeds, will first visit the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, today. However, the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that the facts were not so optimistic. Previously, Britain had instructed Ambassador Seeds to ask the Soviet government whether it still supported the proposal put forward by Britain on April 16. If the Soviet Union's reply was affirmative, then the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union could proceed to explain Britain's position to the Soviet authorities. Another dispatch from the Daily Telegraph correspondent in Moscow stated that Stalin held a meeting with several Central Executive Committee members yesterday. The result of the discussion was that they expressed understanding of Britain's views. The correspondent speculated that the Soviet Union might be prepared to conclude an alliance with Britain and France. (8th Haitong dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the British government has obtained assurances that Soviet foreign policy will not change due to the resignation of former Foreign Commissar Litvinov. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, the country's ambassador Maisky is said to have notified the British government that the country's policy will not be changed as a result. However, some people here still have doubts. In short, what Soviet policy will be depends on the meeting between the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, on this day before it can be seen. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Speculation about changes in Soviet foreign policy continued today. There is no indication of a sudden change in the political bureau that has always directed Soviet foreign policy. Soviet political figures pointed out that the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs is not the person in charge of Soviet foreign policy. The press has not hinted at the possibility of changing policy. Rumors of a Soviet-German reconciliation still lack solid evidence. Political figures believe that the possibility of such a reconciliation is extremely small. (8th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet officials and newspapers have remained silent about the resignation of Foreign Commissar Litvinov. According to a Soviet official, Soviet newspapers have not criticized foreign affairs for several weeks because the current international situation is extremely serious. The government is unwilling to accept any binding terms. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A foreign journalist asked Minister of War Itagaki today whether the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov would affect Soviet foreign policy. Itagaki replied that, in his opinion, the Soviet government believed that Litvinov had gone too far. Litvinov resigned for this reason. Therefore, the Soviet Union will now sit on the fence to fish in troubled waters and will not support any group. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumors of German-Russian Rapprochement Circulate in Berlin Another Divisive Tactic</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, Berlin political circles are rife with rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union may reconcile. This theory began to circulate after Litvinov resigned as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. However, the most reliable National Socialist Party believes that this theory is merely speculation, but they do not believe that Germany and the Soviet Union have no possibility of improving relations. (8th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Soviet Ambassador to Germany Merekalov departed for his country half a month ago. On the eve of his departure, he visited German Foreign Secretary Weizsäcker. As a result, rumors are circulating here that the Soviet Union and Germany may be approaching each other, and both sides have decided to expand the scope of the current commercial treaty. All of this seems to be propaganda by interested parties, intended to cause unease in Poland and Western European countries. German political figures at the time were quite pleased, but now they no longer talk about this and are concerned about the Soviet Union forming an agreement with Western European countries. It can be seen from the decision of Italy and Germany to sign a military and political treaty that these countries fear the formation of an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

According to Polish observers, General Raštikis's trip is to hold talks with General Smigly-Rydz, Director of Military Education of the Polish Army.

Germany was unwilling to sacrifice Lithuania in exchange for the Corridor, so it rejected the proposal. As for rumors that Germany intended to use Poland to establish an independent Ukrainian state, the newspaper denounced it as complete fabrication. (8th Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Danzig Question: England Willing to Mediate; This Issue Was Discussed Before Guarantees; Chamberlain Praises Polish Foreign Minister's Declaration</h3>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Morgan, a Labour Party member of the opposition, inquired whether the dispute between Poland and Germany over the Danzig issue could be submitted to international arbitration. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler replied, "The current legal status of the Free City of Danzig is stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. Any changes to it should be agreed upon by the countries most concerned. Our government has repeatedly expressed that international disputes should be resolved through friendly negotiations, arbitration, or other peaceful means. If any of the countries concerned request our country to mediate on the Danzig issue, we will be happy to do so." Labour Party member Henderson then inquired about the recent speech by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Foreign Minister Beck's words were firm yet conciliatory, which is fortunate." (All members cheered.) Another Labour Party member, Johnston, further inquired whether the government had advised the Polish government to conduct negotiations with Germany when offering guarantees to Poland. "If the German government puts forward reasonable proposals at this time, hoping to find a fair solution to the Danzig issue, British public opinion would very much like Poland to accept them. I wonder if Prime Minister Chamberlain can convey this intention to the Polish government." Prime Minister Chamberlain replied again, "Mr. Johnston must have read Foreign Minister Beck's speech (May 5th). He should know that the Danzig issue had been submitted for discussion by Germany and Poland before our country provided guarantees to Poland. Our government hopes that it will be resolved in a friendly manner. The Polish government is also well aware that our public opinion must be taken into account. This is an important point, and the Polish government also sees this, there is no doubt about it," (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Germany Hopes Poland Will Consider at Length; Claims Unity with Italy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Frankfurter Zeitung claims that Germany has given Poland and the Western countries time for lengthy consideration, hoping they will use it. Hitler's proposals regarding the Polish issue have received Italy's full support. Poland's firm demand for free access to the Baltic Sea is not opposed by Germany. Germany's proposals have not refuted this. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

He met with King Carol II today to report on the trip and scheduled another trip to Turkey and Greece in the short term. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to "Le Petit Parisien," Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to visit the Turkish capital on the 15th, and then travel to Athens, the capital of Greece. According to the newspaper, Turkey and Romania have decided to act in concert diplomatically. The main issue of this decision is the relationship between Romania and Bulgaria.) (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Reiterates Treaty Revision Demands; Maintains Amicable Relations with Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>The Hungarian capital: Following the dissolution of the House of Representatives, a re-election is scheduled for the 28th of this month. President Teleki delivered a campaign speech yesterday, stating, "All ethnic groups that have been under Austro-Hungarian rule should be allowed to establish the political organization they need according to their own wishes. This principle also applies to the Slovak people." "Our country's demand to revise the Treaty of Trianon is not new. This demand has not yet been fulfilled. Although our country has recovered the Carpathian Ukraine province, this is the result of the disintegration of Czechoslovakia and cannot be regarded as achieving the goal of revising the treaty. Regarding our country's relations with the Axis countries, they are very good. Our country maintains the greatest amity with Germany and Italy, and both Germany and Italy recognize our country's important position in the Danube region. Moreover, Germany is our country's largest customer for products, and our country's economy should adapt to this reality. Regarding national defense issues, our country's military reorganization plan was originally scheduled to be completed in five years, and it should now be accelerated to complete it ahead of schedule."

<h3>Spanish Authorities Order Demobilization; Totaling 250,000 People</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to this morning's "Le Petit Parisien," General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish National Army, has ordered the demobilization of a total of three classes, numbering 250,000. All veterans must return home by May 15th, and will then wear civilian clothes. A small living allowance will be issued upon dismissal. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in Yugoslavia; Croatian Autonomy Agreement Not Approved by Regency</h3>
<p>Zagreb: Regarding the issue of Croatian autonomy, an agreement was previously reached between Prime Minister Cvetković and Croatian leader Maček, but it was not approved by Prince Paul, the First Regent. Maček therefore convened a meeting of one hundred representatives of various opposition parties of the Croatian ethnic group at nine o'clock this morning to discuss countermeasures. The meeting adjourned at 12:45 PM and was scheduled to continue at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. During the meeting, a conflict suddenly broke out among the crowd outside the venue, followed by a brawl. A young man opened fire with a pistol, and a member of a Croatian military-style group was shot and injured. It is not yet clear whether the shooter was a member of the government party or a separatist from the Croatian ethnic group. It is reported that the Croatian representatives are deeply dissatisfied with the failure of Maček's negotiations with the government authorities, so it is possible that they will put forward a radical resolution at the meeting to oppose the government authorities. If so, Maček will feel thorny. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force General Secretly Arrives in France</h3>
<p>(London) Major General Alexander, commander of the First Division of the British Air Force, left for Paris on the night of the 6th with several senior air force officers. Because all parties kept the matter secret, the news was only revealed in today's newspapers. It is difficult to ascertain the purpose of the visit to France by the senior British air force officers. It is said that when Major General Alexander and his party flew to Paris, General Blancard, the air force commander of Bourget Airport, and Colonel Durenne, commander of the French Air Force Base No. 194, were at the airport to welcome them.

<h3>German African Party Opposes National Socialism; Declares Maintenance of Freedom</h3>
<p>Windhoek: The German African Party of Southwest Africa is organized by naturalized Germans, mostly German veterans. The entire party opposes the National Socialist system. The party issued a statement today calling on South Africans to firmly maintain freedom. The statement said that Hitler not only wants Southwest Africa, but also needs South Africa to restore the inflated German finances. The party is very surprised by the shortsighted attitude of some of the federal people of Southwest and South Africa towards the current situation in Europe and Africa. South Africans must remember that rights and justice were the supreme law of the former Germany. The statement also said that if the Hitler system would bring blessings to our homeland, we should of course not fight it. The principle embraced by the German African Party is freedom and lasting freedom. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>German-Italian Military Alliance to Be Signed in Berlin; Mussolini to Go in Person; Italian King to Visit Berlin as Well</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, the German-Italian military and political treaty concluded by the German and Italian foreign ministers in Milan yesterday will be signed in Berlin in a few weeks. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will visit Berlin for this purpose and sign this alliance with Hitler on behalf of Italy. The text of the treaty is currently being carefully drafted. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Messenger reports that the German-Italian political and military treaty will be signed in early June. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Como, Italy: After Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop agreed on a political and military treaty in Milan this afternoon, they traveled by car to this city and attended a grand banquet at the Villa d'Este. Crowds gathered on the streets to cheer and pay their respects. Foreign Minister Ciano will return to Rome tonight to report the progress to Prime Minister Mussolini. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will return to Berlin tomorrow evening or early the day after tomorrow. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler visited Italy last May. It is rumored here that King Emmanuel III will visit Germany on the 28th of this month to return the visit. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Attitude</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, all newspapers here published the news of the signing of the German-Italian military agreement with large headlines, but since the news only arrived in Tokyo at 2:00 AM this morning, no editorials have been published. A foreign newspaper reporter asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman to express his opinion on the agreement. The spokesman replied that strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact is Japan's unchanging policy. The reporter asked whether the Anti-Comintern Pact would be related to the military agreement. The spokesman declined to answer this. The reporter then asked Minister of War Itagaki whether Japan had the possibility of joining the German-Italian military agreement. Itagaki replied that the spirit of promoting the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact is deeply rooted, so if Germany and Italy are willing to have it, Japan may as well conclude a military agreement with the Axis powers. Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso said that, according to what he heard, negotiations on the conclusion of a military agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan are clearly in progress. However, according to his personal observation, whether this negotiation can be realized depends entirely on whether Germany and Italy understand Japan's position and power in East Asia and their own situation in Europe. Cooperation between Japan and Germany and Italy to implement its national policy will naturally feel convenient. But if Germany and Italy attempt to implement their national policies in the environment of the encirclement policy implemented by their enemies, without seeking the full cooperation of Japan, the largest power in East Asia, it will not only be inconvenient but also dangerous. Koiso also expressed his opinion, saying that misunderstandings arise when there is a lack of understanding. It would be fortunate for Germany, Italy, and Japan if the two countries had a full and correct understanding of Japan's position and power in East Asia and their own situation in Europe. Japanese people mostly know more about Germany and German events than Germans know about Japan and Japanese events. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman met with reporters today and answered Japan's attitude towards the German-Italian military alliance, saying that Japan's main purpose is to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Regarding whether Japan will sign a military alliance with other anti-communist countries, the spokesman avoided answering, only saying that Japan believes that the Anti-Comintern Pact is the best tool for maintaining amicable relations with Germany and Italy. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of War Itagaki met with a Haitong News Agency reporter today and issued a statement, saying that the conclusion of the German-Italian military and political alliance is a congratulatory event. The unity of the two countries will become more solid in the future, thereby eliminating the unease in Europe and establishing a new order in Europe. Itagaki continued, "The chaos in Europe today is due to the inability of the old powers and the emerging powers to maintain balance." The reporter asked whether Japan would also join this alliance. Itagaki replied that, in terms of the spirit of anti-communism, this matter is not necessarily impossible. Finally, the reporter asked whether the rumored Soviet Russian Far East military strength is very strong and is a threat to the Far East. Itagaki replied yes. (Hai Dian, 8th)</p>
<h3>American Observation: Japan Increasingly Isolated</h3>
<p>(Washington) Diplomats here today speculate that the German-Italian military alliance may isolate Japan, forcing Japan to develop closer relations with Western democracies. Experts who have recently studied Japanese-American and British-Japanese commercial relations also believe that if Japan develops close ties with Germany and Italy, it will be economically extremely fragile. In 1937, Britain and the United States supplied Japan with 3.8% of important military needs, while Italy provided almost no assistance to Japan. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Former British Consul General in Hankou, Sir Goffe, Passes Away</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Goffe, the former British Consul General in Hankou, China, passed away at his private residence here yesterday at the age of sixty-nine. Goffe went to China in 1890 as a trainee interpreter and was promoted several times. In 1911, he served as Acting Consul General in Hankou. The following year, he served as Consul General in Yunnan Prefecture. In 1920, he was transferred to Consul General in Hankou. In February 1927, the British returned the Hankou British Concession to the Chinese Nationalist Government, which was during the tenure of Sir Goffe. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Conflicts Erupt Again on the Border of Mongolia and the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news received here, a serious conflict occurred on the border between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia today. It is said that 50 Mongolian soldiers opened fire on 16 border soldiers and 6 policemen of "Manchukuo." The "Manchu" army "returned fire," and the fierce battle lasted for five hours. As a result, at least three Mongolian soldiers were killed. As for the "Manchu" army, Chang Fang claimed that there were no casualties. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<h3>Different Perspectives on the German-Italian Alliance; Germany and Italy See It as a Natural Result; Britain and France Say International Tendencies Have Not Changed; Poland Believes International Status Weakened</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian "People's Voice" reported that political figures were not surprised by the formal alliance between Italy and Germany, as its significance lies in indicating that there has been no change in the understanding between the two countries. However, it is believed that after the establishment of this alliance, Italy has accepted open constraints and is stronger than before. The mouthpiece of the Italian Foreign Minister reported that Italy and Germany have recognized that each has its own sphere of interest, Italy being the entire Mediterranean, and Germany being the Baltic Sea and Central European region. Each country is engaged in realizing its responsibilities in a spirit of complete autonomy and does not strictly force one party to provide assistance, but only provides convenience. However, there is one thing that the relationship between each other is strong and consistent, that is, the war of principles. Both countries are determined on this because they both know that the failure of one side is the collapse of the other side. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) People here point out that German and Italian military and staff officers have long been in contact, such as General Göring's visit to Rome, Baliani's visit to Berlin, Baliani's meeting with General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, in Innsbruck on April 5th and 6th, and General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, visiting Italy, all of which are related to this matter. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here do not express surprise at the conclusion of the German-Italian military and political alliance in Milan, because they believe that the cooperation of the Axis countries has long been so close that neither side doubts the attitude the other will take under any circumstances. The form of this decision is only to make those who generally promote the incompatibility of German and Italian opinions break down on their own. It is decided that this alliance is defensive in nature and its purpose is to deal with the "aggressive" encirclement policy launched by Britain. This policy has been confirmed by the speech of the Polish Foreign Minister, so this alliance is a natural result of the European situation. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Officials here refuse to comment on the German-Italian political and military agreement pending further news, but believe that Poland's international position in any negotiations on Danzig has been weakened by this agreement. According to non-official sources, Italy was not willing to sign this agreement and was forced to do so because it did not want to see a conflict in Europe over Danzig. At the same time, it is also believed that Mussolini seemed to have obtained a mild guarantee from Germany before agreeing to sign this agreement. Newspaper editorials all believe that the time has now come for Germany to decide the future of Polish-German relations. The Polish government newspaper hopes that Germany will choose a peaceful path and begin negotiations based on the basic conditions put forward by Polish Foreign Minister Beck. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The military and political treaties agreed upon by Germany and Italy are currently being commented on by observers here. Poland should negotiate with Lithuania and try to keep Hungary neutral in order to avoid German encirclement. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that London is not at all surprised by the German-Italian political and military agreement showing the Axis relationship. However, officials do not want to criticize it until they know the details of the scope of the agreement. London observers say that, as far as Italy is concerned, this agreement can determine Germany's military status. There are two points discussed in diplomatic circles: one is the impact on Italy's neutrality under certain circumstances, and the other is Germany's relationship with the Mediterranean and North Africa. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) After Germany and Italy decided to sign a political and military treaty, members of parliament here commented that the idea of Germany, Italy, and Japan signing a military alliance has always been opposed by Japan. Now that Germany and Italy have established this treaty, it may induce Japan to change its original intention, which is not necessarily the case. The main purpose of Germany and Italy in doing this is to respond to the efforts of Britain and France to organize an anti-aggression group. But in practice, the current situation has not changed in any way as a result. German and Italian staff officers have repeatedly held talks recently. General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, even went to inspect the defenses of Italian Libya in North Africa. Their close military cooperation is not new and can be seen from this. It is hoped that Italy can maintain neutrality in wartime, but now it is hopeless. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here believe that the German-Italian political and military alliance cannot change the situation, and believe that the communique issued in Milan focuses on political demonstrations to warn the democracies that the Berlin-Rome axis has not weakened. The "Paris Times" reported that, in view of various circumstances, it makes people think that Mussolini cannot escape Germany's control due to policy errors. At the same time, it is even believed that Italy will continue to try to persuade Germany not to be too stubborn towards Poland. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Germany and Italy decided to sign a political and military agreement, responsible French officials declared that this move only confirms the long-existing facts with diplomatic documents and wants to psychologically influence the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. The international situation has not changed as a result. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) After Germany and Italy decided to sign a political and military treaty, the New York Public Forum commented that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini would ask Germany not to overdo it with Poland and only exercise diplomatic pressure to avoid bloodshed. However, one thing must be known, that is, the victory won in diplomacy is often more brutal than the victory won on the battlefield. The past events of Austria and Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The newspapers published the news of the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin's return from Turkey, calling him "the First Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs." Potemkin will become the assistant of the new Commissar Molotov. From this, it can be seen that the newspapers all praised the results of Potemkin's talks with Turkish officials, saying that they can make the joint strike between the two sides closer. In addition, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is scheduled to meet on the 25th of this month, and the newspapers attach great importance to it. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Italian Side Reports: Germany Offers Guarantee Not to Use Force Against Poland</h3>
<p>Milan: Well-informed sources here have declared that Germany has provided a guarantee to Italy, stating that it will never use violence to enforce its demands on Poland. In other words, it will not place a fait accompli before Italy. This is the condition for Italy's agreement to sign a political and military treaty. Although Italy has been cooperating with Germany militarily for a long time, it has never expressed support for the idea of formally concluding an alliance treaty. After Germany repeatedly made representations, it always treated them with a cold attitude. Now that it has finally agreed to sign this type of treaty, it is because it sincerely hopes that the issue of the Free City of Danzig can be resolved peacefully. It can be seen that in order to make Italy accept this treaty, Germany has had to abandon its grand plan for the Free City of Danzig. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Situation of Japanese Aircraft Bombing Shantou; Ten Japanese Warships Arrive Along the Chaoshan Coast</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese army has been making every effort to attack the Siyi region of the Xijiang River, while also increasing troops from Taiwan to Guangdong, attempting to attack the Chaoshan coast and contain the Chinese army counterattacking the Dongbei River area. Five Japanese warships were originally stationed outside Mayu Port in Shantou, dispersed in the waters of Chenghai, Raoping, and Chaoyang. On the 28th, five more warships suddenly arrived, stationed at Daya Bay in Haifeng County, Jieshi in Lufeng County, Dahao River Dumen in Chaoyang County, outside Mayu Port in Shantou City, and the North and South Ports of Chenghai County. On the 27th, a Japanese cruiser outside Mayu Port dispatched a seaplane to bomb Shantou. The entire city of Shantou was under air raid alerts all day. The first bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft fell near Tongji North Road, but all four landed in the water. Two bombs did not explode, only injuring one elderly woman. At 9:30 AM, the aircraft flew again to the Wujiao area, dropping four bombs. This area is a depot district, with the grain depot of the China Southern Rice Industry Company located there. At that time, two warehouses were destroyed. Residents fled into air raid shelters and were fortunate to be safe. At 10:20 AM, the Japanese aircraft flew into the city again, continuously dropping bombs on Wujiao and Tongji Road, destroying over ten civilian houses. The Liangmao Soybean Oil Factory was destroyed, resulting in seven casualties, both men and women. The purpose of this bombing by the Japanese aircraft seemed to be the Guanghua Wharf Match Factory, as the factory was in the process of manufacturing, employing over a thousand workers. The plan was to turn the raw materials into finished goods and then dismantle the machinery to set up a factory in Xingning. The main purpose was to threaten the residents. The Chaoshan Garrison Headquarters, feeling that the situation was becoming increasingly serious, intensified the forced evacuation of residents, ordering the police stations and neighborhood chiefs to persuade people to move from house to house. Those unable to move were given free boat and vehicle tickets issued by the police district. These tickets were only valid for travel to Chaozhou, Jieyang, Fengshun, and Meizhou, and not back to Shantou. Starting from the 29th, when police districts went door-to-door to persuade people, free boat and vehicle tickets were issued according to the number of people in the household, asking where they wanted to go and specifying which boat or vehicle they were allowed to board, with a one-time use limit. The ticket specified the valid time. It was also heard here on the evening of the 28th that the Japanese warship stationed in Haifeng landed over a hundred soldiers at Magong in Shanwei at 3:00 PM. The local militia immediately rushed to meet them in battle. Seeing that they were prepared, the Japanese soldiers immediately retreated back to the ship, burning five fishermen's cottages and plundering many pigs, chickens, and ducks before leaving. On the 29th, the citizens of Shantou knew that war was inevitable. All factories and shops were closed, with only three or five teahouses operating as usual. Military police patrolled the streets to maintain order. The men, women, old, and young leaving Shantou carried clothing and belongings, walking along the roads. At this time, the Chaoyang-Jieyang ferry no longer operated on a fixed schedule, departing when full. Passengers bought tickets and boarded the ship at any time, not allowed to rush for seats.</p>
<h3>Yangcheng: Broadsword Brigade Ambush Japanese Personnel</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Trains Scoundrels as Spies</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: At 5:00 PM on the 28th, a member of the Japanese pacification team was ambushed and killed by a broadsword brigade in a deserted village six or seven li away from Liuwei. The body was also taken away by the broadsword brigade. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army in Yangcheng was terrified. A curfew was imposed in Yangzhou that night, and the electric lights in Yangcheng were not turned off all night. Also, at dawn on the 28th, the Chinese People's Service Corps burned a section of the Xiannvmiao Erdaoqiao bridge and captured three puppet soldiers. Furthermore, at 11:00 PM on the 28th, the Chinese army attacked Xiannvmiao Sanyuanqiao and Hongqiao in two routes. The Japanese army at Xiannvmiao panicked and randomly fired machine guns at the Chinese army lying in ambush. During the two-hour engagement with the Japanese army, the Japanese side consumed a large amount of ammunition. Subsequently, the Chinese army safely returned to their defenses after their mission was accomplished.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Headquarters in Yangzhou recently recruited a group of opium addicts, totaling thirty-seven, for training. They are all middle-aged scoundrels in their thirties. The training is now complete. They are divided into groups of three or five and dispersed to Chinese army positions and Gaoyou, Taixian, and other places to act as spies. Each traitor is given two new-style explosives, hidden on their person, intending to cause trouble. They have passwords and secret signals when they are active. Traces of them have already been found near Zhaoguan Dam. The Chinese military and political authorities are closely monitoring them.</p>

<h3>Northern Guangdong Province: Chinese Army Gathers to Prepare for General Offensive; Fierce Competition for Xinshi Consumes Much of the Japanese Army; Japanese Reinforcements are in a Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Chinese army launched the initial stage of the counteroffensive in northern Guangdong, they have successively recovered Conghua, Huaxian, and Xinshi, advancing to Guotang and controlling the Jiangcun area. The Japanese army in Guangzhou has also revealed its state of panic. However, the Chinese army's current advance is still localized. The full-scale general counteroffensive is yet to come. Here is a record of the battle situation in the past ten days.</p>
<p>Second Recovery of Xinshi</p>
<p>At the beginning of the counteroffensive, the troops of the Li Division of the Group Army advanced south from the front of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and attacked Xinshi. The Japanese army in Xinshi, caught off guard by the sudden Chinese army attack, fought in a panic, lacking morale, and were eventually defeated by the Chinese army. The Chinese army then recovered Xinshi. Xinshi is of great importance to the future of the war. If Xinshi is obtained, the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway will be no different from being under control. Militarily, it is a must-win place. The Japanese commander Ando immediately drew more than a thousand Japanese troops from Guangzhou and, starting on April 20th, launched a counterattack on Xinshi in three routes. In order to lure the enemy, the Chinese army quickly withdrew from Xinshi, setting a trap to wait and cause the Japanese army to consume as much as possible. That night, the two armies engaged in a fierce battle at Letong in Xinshi. After nightfall, the central route of the Chinese army approached the Xinshi railway station. The fighting was fierce and protracted, with gains and losses of strongholds like a tug-of-war. The left and right wings of the Chinese army took advantage of the darkness to advance and detour. Until the morning of the 21st, they suddenly launched an attack from the side, encircling Xinshi from three directions. In addition to the central route already close to the Japanese position, one route came from behind the station, and another route came from near Hengtan. The Chinese artillery also bombarded the Japanese positions, destroying the Japanese fortifications. The Chinese army then resolutely attacked Xinshi again. The Japanese army fled south along the railway, escaping to Jiangcun via Guotang, suffering three to four hundred casualties. After the Chinese army recovered Xinshi, in the afternoon, they took advantage of the victory to pursue, advancing towards Guotang. After the Japanese army retreated from Xinshi, most of them fled to Jiangcun, but some gathered at Guotang. When the Chinese army advanced near Guotang, the Japanese army counterattacked but soon fled. The area nearby was then occupied by the Chinese army, and the Jiangcun area was controlled.</p>
<p>Frequent Engagements on the Front Lines</p>
<p>After the Chinese army recovered Xinshi again, they established a strong defense to prevent the Japanese army from recapturing it. They immediately pursued the retreating Japanese army, clearing the remnants. Therefore, fierce battles took place in Xin Village, Hengtan, Changgang, and along the Guanghua Road, Longxiang, and Longkou Village. Many Japanese soldiers were annihilated. The Japanese army, now trapped in Longkou Village, still has over a thousand people, putting up a desperate fight. The Chinese army on the railway front is continuing to advance, maintaining vigilance in the Guotang and Shilongxu areas.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army recovered Conghua, they have been attacking towards Shangang. On the evening of the 24th, the Liang Division attacked Shangang at night, annihilating dozens of Japanese soldiers. It is said that the Japanese army has suffered continuous heavy blows from the Chinese army over the past month, with more than half of their casualties, and their strength is very weak. Therefore, they have shortened the surrounding defense lines and tightly secured their camps. It has been learned that the areas west of Shangang, such as Mianya Cliff, Jiulian Tomb, and Mayazhuang, used to be frequently harassed by Japanese infantry and cavalry, looting grain. Recently, the Chinese army has established a strong front line in the area of Aotou Shiqian City, tightly controlling the Japanese army, so the Japanese army no longer dares to send troops to harass. The above-mentioned areas are as peaceful as usual. Also, on the 26th, some of the Japanese army in Shangang retreated towards Taipingchang with food, military supplies, and equipment, with unclear intentions. The Wang Regiment of a certain division of the Chinese army in Huaxian has been pressing south along the Guanghua Line towards Xilong Pingshan for days. The Japanese army guarding this area is the remnants of the Fujii and Watanabe units. Fearing an attack by the Chinese army, they are moving around erratically. On the 24th and 25th, over two hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry, accompanied by a small artillery unit, sneaked into Pingshan. The Chinese army's attacking team then launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army late at night on the 26th, encircling and annihilating them in several routes. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted, relying on the terrain, but their strength gradually waned. Then, the Japanese army in Longkou Village, upon hearing the news, immediately rushed to reinforce in armored vehicles. A certain battalion of the Chinese army's fresh troops also joined the battle at this time. The battle situation was fierce. The Chinese army bravely charged, stepping into the Japanese positions. The Japanese army was defeated in a panic, retreating into the market town and being trapped. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese army, and more than ten long and short guns and several war horses were seized. It was not until dawn that the Chinese army voluntarily withdrew to their original positions.</p>
<p>The Chan-Tan line on the left wing of the Chinese army has also made progress in the past week. The Li Division troops of the Group Army have been pressing towards Tanbu from the direction of Chibaini. Only a little over a hundred Japanese troops are stationed there. On the morning of the 27th, the Chinese artillery first launched an attack on the Japanese army, firing five or sixty shells in succession. Many shells hit, destroying the Japanese fortifications. A battalion of the Chinese army took the opportunity to charge at the Japanese army. The Japanese army was weak and was defeated in one battle, retreating towards Fengyong. The Chinese army captured many prisoners. By noon, the Japanese army in the Tanbu area had retreated south one after another. The Chinese army is pursuing them in the middle of the pursuit.</p>
<p>Chinese Army Gathers for General Offensive</p>
<p>Currently, the Chinese army is stationed with heavy troops between Xinshi and Letong, confronting the Japanese army retreating to Jiangcun and Guotang. The main force of the Group Army is gathering at Juntian, Yinzhan'ao, and other places. At the same time, they are closely coordinating with guerrilla units in various places. Commander Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanmou will readjust the various armies and inspect the front lines. Once the time for the general offensive arrives, they will give the Japanese army an even greater blow.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Rapidly Reinforces</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the Jiangbei position has been repeatedly annihilated by the Chinese army, so they have transferred troops stationed in Guangzhou and the suburbs to reinforce the northern Guangdong area, resulting in a significant reduction of Japanese troops in Guangzhou. The so-called maintaining of治安is only carried out by a small number of Japanese military police and puppet self-defense forces. As for their reinforcement situation, it has been learned that thousands of troops have been suddenly added to the Taipingchang, Shangang, Qiangang, and Zhongluotan areas in the past week, totaling ten thousand people including the previous troops. They are forcing civilians to build barracks and ammunition depots in Shiling and other places in Taipingchang, and they are also ordering two able-bodied men to be drawn from each village in nearby villages and formed into the South China Plainclothes Advance Team. Furthermore, the original 400 Japanese troops stationed in Shangang have been transferred to Shiling to reinforce. There are now over a thousand Japanese troops in Shiling. A certain unit of the Group Army of the Chinese army has surrounded the Japanese army in Shiling, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate them. As for the Japanese army in the Jiangcun area, they are also forcing the people to build many more fortresses, attempting to defend to the death.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Inspects Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Bai is Extremely Optimistic About the Future of the War Against Japan</p>
<p>Yongkang Correspondence: Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Zhejiang from Jiangxi the day before yesterday to inspect the military affairs of the various war zones under his command. Those who came with him included Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, He Sui, Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, and others. Huang Shaohong, Liu Jianxu, and others personally went to greet them. The next morning, Bai summoned personnel from various agencies to give instructions, giving detailed instructions on all aspects of the party, government, and military. He also spoke freely about the war situation to visitors. He also gave a considerable explanation of the construction of our country's land and air forces, believing that Japan will never have the ability to increase troops in China again. He is extremely optimistic about the future of the war against Japan. Bai has now transferred to a certain place for inspection. (April 20th)</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Japanese Army Conscription is Busy</h3>
<p>There is a Fierce Battle at Jiaoshanmen Bridge</p>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: The Japanese army, due to the active guerrilla warfare on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, has transferred Japanese troops from Shanghai and Hangzhou to concentrate in Hecheng, attempting to respond with Hecheng as the general supply station, controlling the Sujia and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Therefore, Jiaxing has been full of Japanese soldiers in recent days. On the 5th, two thousand soldiers from the Ishikawa and Yamamoto units were dispatched to Huangwan, Ganpu, Jiaoliyan, Changchuanba, and other places, forcing the people to rush to build highways and bridges. The Haiyan Puppet County Office was established in Ganpu, with Yu Sen as the chief of the police station. Three hundred Japanese soldiers also arrived in Xinzuan Town. The Jiaoshanmen Bridge, the end point of the Jiashan-Jiaoshan Highway (Jiaxing County boundary), has been the site of fierce battles between the Japanese army and the Chinese army under Jiang Bu, Wu Liangbi, Shen Guangming, and others since the 6th. The sound of artillery fire continued all night.</p>
<h3>Great Chaos in Yixing</h3>
<p>Zang Licheng Flees to Wuxi</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The four suburbs of Yixing have recently been controlled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army once stormed into the city, and many bridges on the Xiyi Highway were also destroyed. The Japanese army stationed at Heqiao and Caoqiao rushed to Yixing to help, and fierce battles broke out with the Chinese army. In the great chaos in Yixing City, the puppet magistrate Zang Licheng has fled to Wuxi, not daring to go to Yixing.</p>
<h3>Guerilla War Occurs in Meili, Changshu</h3>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: The Dongxiang guerrilla unit under Ren Tianshi has been quite active recently.

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Develops Special Ethnic Education</h3>
<p>14,000 Yuan Allocated This Year; Special Teacher Training Classes Established</p>
<p>(Guilin Special Dispatch) According to statistics from the Guangxi Provincial Government, there are over 300,000 people from special ethnic groups within the province, namely the Yao, Miao, Lao, Guo, Ling, Tong, Nong, and Sheng Nong tribes, distributed in over 60 counties, scattered in deep mountains and poor valleys, with a very low level of culture. In recent years, the provincial government has been actively seeking to develop their education. In 29 townships and 1,026 villages where special ethnic groups are scattered, 36 central national basic schools have been established by township, and 62 national basic schools have been established by village. This year, 14,000 yuan has been added to the annual budget as subsidies, and special teacher training classes have been attached to the Donglan Fengshan Tian'e Joint National Middle School, making it easier for children from special ethnic groups in the northwest to attend school.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Continues to Hold the Middle School Graduation Joint Examination Trend (II)</h3>
<p>Does the Joint Examination Hinder Youth Health? (The example of the Beijing Municipal Elementary School Joint Examination shows that although some students lost weight, others gained weight. The factors contributing to weight loss include climate, diet, sleep, and illness, and cannot be solely attributed to the joint examination. The original text also discusses other aspects, which are omitted for brevity.) Discussion of Improvement. So, is the joint examination free of serious malpractices? That is not the case. The situation of the aforementioned elementary schools in former Beiping, where the joint examination increased the workload, may still be prevalent in middle schools across the country today. Even if the subjects in the joint examination have been reduced, schools cannot avoid additionally increasing the teaching hours for the subjects in the joint examination. Why? The courses for Chinese History and Chinese Geography are completed in the second grade, while the courses for Foreign History, Foreign Geography, Mathematics, and Chemistry are not started until the last semester. However, most or part of the courses were completed long ago. It is not easy to lightly mention examinations for these past subjects and courses without a period of review. Moreover, schools with poor performance are aware that they have neglected teaching in the past. Without reviewing, there is no way to take the exam. Those with excellent performance also feel that it is difficult to win without reviewing. As a result, the learning burden of young people suddenly increases, and their health is harmed. Why wait until the joint examination is held? Some suggest that the way to correct this is to limit the subjects and the amount of coursework in the joint examination to those in the last semester, without tracing back to the past. This is indeed a good plan for the joint examination. However, what about those who must take the entire course in the entrance examination after graduation? Moreover, the scope of the graduation examination is the level of graduation, while the entrance examination even exceeds the level of graduation. The difficulty is far above the problem of the joint examination. If the entrance examination and the graduation joint examination cannot be connected and merged, then those who are exempt from the joint examination cannot be exempt from the entrance examination. What is the value of this temporary exemption, and why gather all the difficulties afterward? Last year, the Ministry held a unified enrollment for all public universities nationwide. Students with excellent results in the provincial joint examination were exempted from the entrance examination. This was only a temporary incentive method. In the future, we should thoroughly seek a reform of the system, or, like France, strictly implement the middle school graduation joint examination and directly exempt the university entrance examination.</p>
<p>As for the joint examination, there are many technical issues that should continue to be improved, such as the oral examination, the way of formulating questions, the scope of topics, and the time for supplementary examinations. All of this depends on objective attitude and thorough discussion. (End)</p>

<h3>Su Education Director Ma Yuanfang Talks About the Entire Picture of Education in Jiangsu Province After the War (Part 1): Changes in Provincial and County Education Administrative Organizations and a General Overview of the Work of Implementing Anti-Japanese Education</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) Jiangsu Education Director Ma Yuanfang recently published the situation of education in Jiangsu after the war as follows: In the past, the education industry in Jiangsu Province was the most developed province in the country's education industry. In addition to the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, there were eight colleges and universities, 41 provincial secondary schools, 33 provincial primary schools and compulsory experimental areas, 14 provincial social education institutions, 68 county secondary schools, and 106 private secondary schools. It is estimated that there were more than 1,000 classes in secondary schools, accommodating more than 50,000 secondary school students. There were more than 8,000 county primary schools and junior primary schools in each county, with a total of more than 15,000 classes, accommodating more than 750,000 primary school students (the above figures are from the 25th year and do not include compulsory classes). The total amount of the provincial education budget in the 26th year was more than 6.4 million yuan, and the total amount of the county education budget was more than 11.2 million yuan. The prosperity of the industry can be said to be unique. Since the War of Resistance against Japan and the fall of Jiangsu Province into the war zone, the scope of the war was initially in a corner of Shanghai and Shanghai, and then expanded to the north and south of the Yangtze River. The educational institutions of Jiangsu Province were either bombed or burned. The amount of the loss is difficult to count. However, our country's strength in the War of Resistance and the spirit of building the country through resistance are increasing day by day. Under the difficult struggle of the military and political authorities in northern Jiangsu, the complete organization is still maintained. Although the education industry in Jiangsu Province has undergone many changes this year, it has fortunately not been interrupted. Amidst the smoke of gunpowder, the sound of stringed instruments and songs can still be heard. This is the result of the joint efforts and hard work of the colleagues in the education sector of Jiangsu Province. Now, the recent educational situation in Jiangsu is specifically described below:</p>
<p>Changes in Provincial Education Administrative Institutions</p>
<p>The changes in the provincial education administrative organization and the internal organization of the Education Department were originally the Secretariat, the Inspection Room, the Compilation and Examination Room, the First Section (managing higher and secondary education), the Second Section (managing local education administration and elementary education), the Third Section (managing social education), and the Fourth Section (managing education funding). There was also the Education Funding Committee, the Secondary Normal Teachers Examination Committee, the Primary School Teacher Examination Committee, the Compulsory Education Committee, and the Illiteracy Elimination Education Committee to take charge of various tasks. In the spring of the 27th year, the provincial government temporarily moved to Huaiyin, and the internal organization of the department was slightly reduced. It was the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding), the Second Section (managing local education administration and elementary education), and the Third Section (managing secondary education). Later, the Third Section was merged into the Second Section. The most recent organization is the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding), the Second Section (managing education affairs), the Inspection Room, the Compilation and Examination Room, and a liaison office in Shanghai to handle all the matters related to the relocation and resumption of schools in the province.

<h3>Today is the 5/9 National Humiliation Memorial, Citizens Deeply Mourn</h3>
<p>Saving from Thrift to Relieve Refugees, Upholding the Environment and Not Flying Half-Mast</p>
<p>Today is the 25th anniversary of the 5/9 National Humiliation. The people of this city are fasting for a day to express their deep sorrow and using the savings to relieve refugees. In order to uphold the difficult environment, raising the flag at half-mast will be temporarily suspended. Various groups in the city have given narratives on the brief history of 5/9, which are extracted as follows: (2) On January 18, 1915, Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to the Beijing government. On May 7 of the same year, it issued an ultimatum. Yuan Shikai, blinded by his imperial ambitions, succumbed to it and signed the agreement on this day twenty-five years ago. However, our compatriots across the country firmly opposed it. Since then, the May 30th Massacre of 1925, the Jinan Massacre of May 3, 1928, the September 18th Incident of 1931 in the Northeast, and the January 28th Incident of 1932 in Shanghai all stemmed from the evil seeds sown by the Twenty-One Demands of 5/9. Therefore, the central government has designated today as the National Humiliation Memorial Day, so that the people across the country can be vigilant. If the national humiliation is not avenged for even one day, the compatriots across the country will never have a day of peace. (2) The July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident was a complete exposure of the invasion conspiracy and the final juncture for our country to avenge the humiliation and seek survival. The central government saw this and resolutely launched a full-scale war of resistance. The President proclaimed to our people, "If we do not resist at this time, our entire nation will perish, and our descendants will forever be slaves, cattle, and horses, with no hope of recovery." Therefore, if we want to wash away the national humiliation and save the nation, we must uphold the national policy and use the Thirty-Two Articles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction as the overall response to the Twenty-One Demands. Under this special environment, our Shanghai compatriots should be deeply vigilant, firm in their beliefs, intensify their work, be down-to-earth, work hard with their heads down, not value formality, pay attention to practicality, and gather the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the entire people for a long-term struggle. Final victory will be within our grasp.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Opened as Usual Yesterday, Situation Slightly More Stable</h3>
<p>However, the seriousness of large households still buying in remains undiminished. The Evaluation Committee will hold a meeting today to strictly crack down.</p>
<p>Due to the manipulation of hoarders, rice prices in the Shanghai rice market have skyrocketed. Compared with the previous investigation, the current rice reserves have decreased by more than 40,000 bags. The Evaluation Committee is scheduled to convene a committee meeting today to discuss stabilization measures. Those who speculate and manipulate will be investigated and dealt with, and they will be advised not to engage in speculative rice business to avoid affecting the people's food. The Doumi Industry Association will report to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Market Situation Still Serious</p>
<p>Although the Doumi Industry Market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday, the market situation was slightly more stable than the day before yesterday, but it was still very serious. Due to the price limit of 15 yuan for high-grade white japonica rice, there were no formal transactions on the market. The prices of rice in various warehouses have risen to the limit price. Although all members of the Market Committee have tried their best to persuade, the results were minimal. Large households are still buying in, resulting in a phenomenon where demand exceeds supply. This has caused those holding rice to remain on the sidelines and not sell, so the number of transactions is only about 1,000 to 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Evaluation Committee Meeting to Discuss Measures</p>
<p>The Rice Evaluation Committee, in view of the speculative manipulation by domestic households, which has led to improper rice prices, has decided to convene the third Rice Evaluation Committee meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss concrete measures for strict crackdown in order to crack down on hoarding and speculation. It plans to conduct a thorough investigation of the rice reserves in the Shanghai market and the names of the owners. At the same time, it will conduct rice reserve registration and report large households that manipulate, speculate, hoard, and engage in price gouging to the authorities for investigation and handling to avoid the high rice prices in the Shanghai market and affecting the livelihood of millions of citizens. A notice was issued yesterday, stating that the committee is scheduled to convene the third meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month (Tuesday). It is hoped that you will attend the meeting at that time for discussion.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Authorities on the Price Limit Process</p>
<p>The Shanghai Doumi Industry Association reported to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday that on the 5th of this month, the association invited representatives from the Rice Store Association, Rice Milling Association, Rice Retail Association, Changshu Guild Hall, Nanbang Guild Hall, and the Shanghai North Rice Transportation Merchants Association to hold a joint meeting of rice industry groups to discuss the rice price issue. (Omitted from previous reports) The above is the process of this joint meeting of rice industry groups. It can be seen that there is no other reason for the change of the price limit, and the strict penalty rules are to prevent another price increase. In the end, the main purpose is still to increase the source of rice and stabilize the market price, which can be understood by your bureau (association). Therefore, a special letter is submitted for reporting, hoping to be approved for record, and expressing great gratitude.</p>
<p>Six Surveys of Accurate Rice Reserves</p>
<p>The Rice Evaluation Committee is responsible for surveying the rice reserves in each rice warehouse. The sixth survey ended yesterday. According to the announcement, the total amount of rice in the city is 567,138 bags, a decrease of 44,015 bags compared to the previous survey.

<p>Sincerely Advising to Maintain People's Food Supply</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She met with a leader of the rice industry yesterday morning. According to him, the total rice reserves in Shanghai are more than 500,000 bags. The cost of these reserves is around the price limit. If they are sold at the price limit, there will be profits. Now, hoarders are taking advantage of this lean season to manipulate rice prices in order to seek huge profits, which is hateful. In addition to reporting to the authorities for investigation and handling, it is hoped that all hoarders will consider the overall situation and share the difficulties of the times, and not engage in speculative rice business. Because rice is a daily necessity for citizens, it is different in nature from other goods.</p>
<p>Not Suitable for Hoarding During the Plum Rain Season</p>
<p>Due to the soaring rice prices, the general public in the two concessions are rushing to buy rice from rice stores. As a result, rice stores that are members of the Rice Store Association have seen a surge in transactions in recent days. Now, each rice store has advised rice buyers that Shanghai's rice reserves are still sufficient, and the source of rice will not be interrupted after dredging. Moreover, as the plum rain season is approaching, it is not suitable to buy and hoard too much rice. According to rice industry sources, the rice reserves surveyed by the Evaluation Committee refer to various warehouses and firms. As for the rice pre-purchased by citizens, it is not included.</p>
<p>Exert Efforts to Dredge the Source of Rice</p>
<p>In order to maintain the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai, various rice industry groups, in addition to cracking down on speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and price gouging, are also making every effort to dredge the source of rice. Because the rice transported from the producing areas to Shanghai will definitely not suffer losses according to the current price limit. Although the producing areas are affected by the Japanese control and the local authorities restrict leaving the border, the transport of rice to Shanghai has not been cut off. The rice blocked at the Rice Market Ferry and other places has been successively released. The goods arriving in Shanghai in recent days amount to three or four thousand bags per day, which is the same as in previous years.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Gradually Sailing on Zhejiang-Shanghai Route</h3>
<p>Full Restoration Still Under Consideration, Current Situation Has Not Yet Eased</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai routes, after being approved by the Zhejiang Eastern Military Authorities, transportation has gradually been dredged. However, due to incidents such as Japanese warships hindering or detaining ships, most foreign ships are watching and not moving forward in order to avoid accidental losses. Currently, there are only a few flights. The situation will be observed later, and if there are no other changes, the full restoration will be carried out. The reporter from Da Guang She has investigated and recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Ende and Nanning Come to Shanghai Together</p>
<p>The Ende ship of the Italian Chinese Company, after sailing empty from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 5th of this month, arrived safely at that port on the evening of the 6th. It is currently loading various passengers and goods. It was originally planned to return to Ningbo on the 7th, but due to insufficient loading of passengers and goods, it was changed to leaving Wenzhou on the evening of the 8th. If there are no other accidents or delays during the voyage, it is expected that it will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. According to the report received by the British Taikoo Company's Nanning ship from Hong Kong to Wenzhou, it is already on its way from Wenzhou to Shanghai and will arrive in Shanghai at 4:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>German Ships Resuming Service to Wenzhou One After Another</p>
<p>The Moufu ship of the German Lihuo Foreign Company was originally scheduled to resume service to Wenzhou soon. However, after the incident of the detention of the German Pingdeng ship by the Japanese warship, it was postponed again and again. In view of the fact that the British Jardine Matheson Company's Lisheng, Taikoo's Nanning, and the Italian Chinese Company's Ende have resumed service, the ship is also scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning (9th). The German Lulin Foreign Company's Feikang and Lihuo Foreign Company's Haifu are also planning to resume service to Wenzhou tomorrow (10th). If there are no other changes, the schedule will not be changed.</p>
<p>Hana Ship Changed to Sailing to Dinghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Hana ship of the German Far East Company, which resumed service on the Shanghai-Dinghai line for the first time, returned to Shanghai on the 7th. The second flight was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 8th, but due to the loading and unloading time of passengers and goods, it was postponed to 4:00 PM today (9th).</p>
<h3>Foreigners Send Telegrams, Japanese Planes Bomb Mogan Mountain, Which is Actually a Neutral Zone, Senders Urge the Consular Corps to Maintain It</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the secretary of the Mogan Mountain Summer Resort Association, also known as Beckman, a member of the Southern American Methodist Church, received a brief telegram last night (7th) from Nordhute, the person in charge of the Mogan Mountain Refugee Shelter, stating that the famous summer resort 50 kilometers north of Hangzhou was bombed by Japanese planes yesterday morning. This is the first air raid on Mogan Mountain since the Chinese army withdrew from the Hangzhou area. The telegram did not specify the number of casualties or material losses. The place of origin was Xiaofeng County, near Mogan Mountain. It is believed that Nordhute ordered coolies to go from Mogan Mountain to the nearest telegram station to send the</p>
<p>Bombed News</p>
<p>It was sent out at 1:54 AM yesterday morning, with a slight delay. It was received here at 10:02 PM last night, stating, "Japanese planes bombed Mogan Mountain today, urging the consular corps to maintain the neutral zone, Nordhute." It is heard that there are many chicken farmers living in Mogan Mountain, most of whom are extremely poor. According to Beckman's estimation, when he left the area in January, there were 2,000 refugees, almost</p>
<p>All Women and Children</p>
<p>When foreigners leave the mountain, the International Relief Committee, run by Chinese, takes care of these refugees, assists in self-reliance activities, and provides free education. Nordhute was invited to stay in Mogan Mountain to take care of the refugees after Shirase of Soochow University. In his capacity as a neutral person, he is doing his best to protect the area and the refugees. Both the Chinese and Japanese armies have agreed to avoid Mogan Mountain, so the mountain is actually a neutral zone. According to Ms. Huait, who has been engaged in</p>
<p>Relief Work</p>
<p>For several months before coming to Shanghai, she stated this morning that during the war in the area, Chinese soldiers were not allowed to stay on the mountain. The Chinese army had orders that they must not approach the area unless they were oppressed by the Japanese army to the point of extreme danger. The Chinese army was able to implement this guarantee. Since Chinese soldiers could not stay in the area, the mountain was never used as a base for the Chinese guerrillas to fight. Therefore, there is no reasonable motive for the bombing yesterday morning. It is said that guerrillas would rather use</p>
<p>Xiaofeng and Wukang</p>
<p>Mountains with fewer traces of people in the area, rather than Mogan Mountain, which clearly shows its route on the tourist map. Even when the Japanese army advanced from the Taihu Lake area to the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, the Chinese regular army did not use the mountain as a military base for the benefit of the civilians living in Mogan Mountain. Most of the foreigners on the mountain withdrew a few months before Hangzhou fell, taking public buses to Ningdu and then taking a boat to Shanghai. The withdrawal was taken care of by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and proceeded smoothly.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Society Organized by Fellow Provincials - Donation Situation</h3>
<p>Already Reached Over 65,000 Yuan - Piggy Bank Campaign Regularly Unveiled</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Fellow Provincials Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its fourth executive committee meeting yesterday. The committee members present were Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Jin Zongcheng, Pei Yunqing, Li Qingfan, Guo Qiming, Yan Cangshan, Cheng Kefan, Zhang Yizhai, Cai Xiaohe, Ge Futian, Cao Zhigong, Liu Zhongying, Hu Shouqi, Chen Weifan, and more than ten others. The meeting was chaired by Xu Xiaochu. First, the chairman reported on the fundraising situation, stating that the total donations raised so far had reached over 65,000 yuan, which had been successively remitted to the association. Next,</p>
<p>Discussion of Various Proposals</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to promote the piggy bank disaster relief campaign. It was resolved that (A) the first unveiling ceremony would be held at 1:00 PM on the 14th of this month on the third floor of the association; (B) it was appropriate to hold a regular publicity week for the piggy bank disaster relief campaign, and Liu Zhongying, Cao Zhigong, and Hu Shouqi were appointed to carry out the preparatory work. (2) Proposal by committee members Zhang Yizhai and Cai Xiaohe to organize a literary and artistic disaster relief conference. It was resolved that the principle was approved, and Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yizhai, and Cai Xiaohe were appointed to formulate specific measures and be responsible for the preparation. (3) Proposal to hold joint performances by amateur opera groups from various regions. It was resolved that Hu Shouqi and Chen Weifan would be appointed to handle the negotiations. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. Also, in Shanghai,</p>
<p>Infant Relief</p>
<p>The infant relief center has been established for nearly two years and has been working tirelessly to take in orphaned and distressed infants. It is now reported that the center, in order to expand its operations, has specially invited artists to hold a broadcast fundraising campaign at the Dalaideng and other radio stations all day today (5/9). It is also reported that the board of directors, led by Zhou Bangjun, has approved renowned artists in Yue opera and comedic singing to perform voluntarily. It is expected to be a grand occasion, and enthusiastic philanthropists are encouraged to donate generously. The proceeds are certain to be considerable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Break into Dinghai - Ningbo Bombed Four Times</h3>
<p>Incendiary Bombs Destroy Over a Hundred Houses with No Casualties - Japanese Warships Break into Dinghai and Then Sail Away on Their Own</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, after Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft in the commercial district on the 28th of last month and on the 1st and 2nd of this month, on the morning of the 6th, Japanese aircraft again flew to Ningbo to wreak havoc. On that day, a total of seven Japanese aircraft came and dropped twenty-one bombs at both ends of the Xinjiang Bridge. The bomb landing sites included Fangjingtou, Tangxing Street, Yinhang Street (i.e., Hongxia Street), Maojia Alley, and the Taohuadu and Baisha River surfaces on the north bank.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>The bombs that landed on Yinhang Street included incendiary bombs, so they immediately caught fire and burned, destroying over a hundred houses. Because the residents had automatically evacuated in advance, there were no casualties. However, after this fourth catastrophe, Ningbo's commercial heart has been severely damaged, and the bustling city is like a ruin. There are very few people during the day. However, the local administration is proceeding as usual, and the work of comforting and relieving victims is being actively carried out.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Harass Dinghai</p>
<p>In addition to the bombing incident in Ningbo, according to the Datong News Agency's reporters, on the morning of the 6th, at 9:00 AM, a Japanese warship suddenly appeared in Dinghai and broke into Zhushanmen (i.e., the Dinghai port), anchoring directly on the Jiangtou River. Because it did not attempt to dock and land, the local authorities responded calmly. The warship sailed away on its own at 11:00 AM at noon, but the residents of the Dinghai urban area were inevitably alarmed, and many people relocated.</p>
<p>Factory Relocation</p>
<p>Since Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft several times, the number of casualties was considerable, and the damage to houses was significant. According to a letter from residents in Shanghai yesterday, after the Japanese aircraft bombed Ningbo, stores immediately stopped doing business during the day. Local agencies and commercial firms that did not have storefronts had all moved out of the bustling areas. All factories had also been ordered to move to the countryside to start work. The elderly, weak, women, and children among the residents, as well as unnecessary personnel, had also been notified to evacuate separately. Therefore, the Ningbo market is less lively during the day, except at night. Foreigners residing in Ningbo had all hung flags or drawn very clear signs on their residences and properties. The authorities were actively adding various air defense facilities, but the market was as peaceful as usual, and people were still calm.</p>
<p>Schools Suspended</p>
<p>According to reports, since Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft several times, all schools had decided to evacuate and suspend classes separately. Most schools had announced a temporary suspension of classes for ten days from the end of last month. After the period expired, a decision would be made based on the situation.</p>
<h3>Chuansha Guerrilla - Zhou Jintao Passes Away</h3>
<p>Zhou Jintao, the commander of the 1st Battalion of Zhang Huifang's Hua Army Guerrilla Force in Chuansha County, Pudong, since leading his troops to recover the suburbs of the city last month, was ordered to be stationed at Xujialukou in the county, repeatedly threatening the Japanese and puppet troops. However, Zhou Jintao was wounded by a bullet in a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops on the 16th of last month. Although the team urgently sent him to Puxi for treatment, Zhou passed away due to excessive grief and indignation. He sacrificed himself for the country, and all who heard of it mourned.</p>
<h3>Various Japanese Government Bonds - Plummet in Foreign Markets</h3>
<p>4% Government Bonds Only Worth £28 - Others Only Around £40</p>
<p>According to the French-language "Beijing Political News," according to London news, in the past month, Japanese government bonds have continued to fall in the London market. Their prices are all below 50% of the face value. It is reported that the Japanese 4% government bonds of 1899 are now only worth £29, the 4% government bonds of 1910 are only worth £28, the 5% government bonds of 1907 are only worth £37, and the 6% government bonds of 1924 are only worth £43. Also, the 5% Tokyo municipal bonds are only worth £38.</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Praises - Chinese Merchants Have Amazing Abilities - Trading in Extremely Difficult Circumstances - Anxious About Promoting International Trade</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting yesterday. Chairman Schlusser elected new officials and read last year's report, which gave a visual description of the business last year. The following is an excerpt from Schlusser's speech,</p>
<p>Merchants' Difficulties Reported to the Government</p>
<p>Schlusser first talked about the Sino-Japanese War, saying that our residence in Hong Kong is closely related to the current Sino-Japanese War. Unfortunately, the Sino-Japanese War does not seem to be stopping. We are heartbroken that we cannot stand by and mediate. What is gratifying is that Hong Kong has done its best to help the refugees in the war zone. The main purpose of this chamber of commerce is to promote the interests of international trade and the open door policy, which we are deeply concerned about. This chamber of commerce has reported the difficulties felt by merchants to the government, but the government has many things to deal with and may not have time to take care of them for the time being. We must be patient and wait. The representatives of the British government and the British chambers of commerce in various parts of China have helped a lot in conveying the opinions of the British merchants. The Hong Kong government is also paying close attention to the Chinese people's business in difficult times. We should express our gratitude here.</p>
<p>Amazing Ability of Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>Schlusser described Hong Kong's trade last year, saying that most of Hong Kong's business last year could be described as satisfactory, but it was only temporary, because the business of the Yangtze River and North China was transferred here. In October, Guangzhou fell, and the Pearl River and the Chinese section of the Jiugang Road were closed, and business immediately declined, but the impact was not as great as we expected, because Chinese merchants have amazing abilities and can trade in extremely difficult circumstances. After the outbreak of the war, refugees gathered in Hong Kong, which increased the government's difficulties, but at the same time stimulated Hong Kong's business. Under the imperial preferential tariff system, manufacturing goods to supply the imperial market maintained a superior position last year. This proves that the plan is sufficient to promote imperial trade.</p>
<p>Eager to Restore Shipping on the Pearl River</p>
<p>Hong Kong's shipyards are also very developed. Taikoo Shipyard built four ships last year. At the beginning of this year, it also built the "Breconshire" wheel with a weight of 10,000 tons for Glendon Shipping Company. This is the largest ship ever built in Hong Kong. Its sister ship "Glenrothes" is also under construction at the yard. Huangpu Shipyard built a total of fifteen new ships last year, including the "Yongsheng" and "Taisheng" wheels of the Annam Shipping Company. Those who had been repaired in the shipyard had the intention of mailing Gan Deluozi. Although Hong Kong can trade in the current situation, it is quite restricted. We are eager to reopen the Pearl River and restore shipping.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Export Merchants' Interests</p>
<p>Schlusser then briefly described the implementation of the Imperial Air Mail Plan to Hong Kong and the government's increase in mail delivery time, and then raised the issue of the government's plan to take back the wharves in 1949, saying that the government issued a notice in October last year, saying that it did not intend to renovate the wharves and only considered expanding the port, whether it was done by the government or by merchants, or jointly by the government and merchants, but promised not to delay the time and accepted good opinions. Since then, the government has not issued any more notices, so we must wait for the government's plan to be released before we can decide again, but it is better for the government to hand it over to merchants. Schlusser then mentioned the Imperial Preferential Tariff System, saying that Hong Kong manufacturers and exporters have benefited greatly from it. The largest industries developed in Hong Kong under this tariff system are canvas, rubber shoes, etc.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees - Another 400 Arrive</h3>
<p>Scarlet Fever Still Rampant - One Youth Has Died</p>
<p>Continental News reports that 440 Jewish refugees from Germany arrived in Shanghai yesterday (7th) aboard the Italian mail ship Contiroso. This brought the total number of European refugees to around 8,000. The refugees landed at the Customs Wharf at around 6:00 PM, including fifty children. There were also a small number of more unfortunate refugees.</p>
<p>Sick on the Ship</p>
<p>They were sent to the Jewish Refugee Hospital on Huasheng Road by doctors from the European Refugee Committee. Their conditions were not serious. According to the refugees, they had been imprisoned in a concentration camp in their home country, but they were afraid of Nazi retaliation, so they did not dare to describe their experiences in the country they did not want to return to. The local committee has accommodated 100 of the newly arrived refugees in the Riverside Building. Dozens more have been taken care of by relief organizations.</p>
<p>Sheltering in Churches on the Museum Road</p>
<p>A small number of refugees were welcomed by relatives who had arrived here before them and provided with temporary accommodation. According to some refugees who arrived in Shanghai, the journey from Europe was comfortable and there were very few cases of seasickness. The English-language "Greater America Evening Post" reports that a terrible case of scarlet fever has invaded the European refugee camp north of the Suzhou River. As of today (8th), a total of 110 people have been infected with the disease. Yesterday afternoon, one person died. German-Jewish doctors have received voluntary</p>
<p>Nursing Assistance</p>
<p>from among the refugees and are doing their best to contain the spread of the disease. Jordan, the director of the Public Works Bureau's health department, stated that the health department is working with doctors to treat patients in the temporary isolation hospital on Zhaofeng Road. However, the situation does not allow the health authorities of the Public Concession to fully assist these refugees, as the Public Concession is densely populated and there are not enough nurses. At the same time, health workers are currently in the refugee camp where the disease was discovered</p>
<p>Conducting Disinfection</p>
<p>and are doing their best to help doctors fight the spread of scarlet fever. Within a few days, there were 110 cases, which is alarming, but the medical community here believes that this epidemic can be dealt with satisfactorily in the short term. The person who died yesterday was a 25-year-old youth who arrived in Shanghai with his parents on April 3. He was sent to the hospital at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and died around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Strike at Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company - Japanese Staff Routinely Beat and Humiliate Employees - Company Forced to Sign Guarantee Conditions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ferry Company, funded by the Japanese Nisshin Shipping Company, has a total of thirteen ferries, including "Donggou Maru," "Dongchang Maru," "Xidu Maru," "Qichang Maru," "Beijing Maru," "Dinghai Maru," "Weisai Maru," "Takahashi Maru," "Jiangsu Maru," "Chunjiang Maru," "Wusong Maru," "Zhejiang Maru," and "Qingning Maru." Most of them are</p>
<p>Seized after the War</p>
<p>and renamed city ferries, operating between Pudong's Gaoqiao, Donggou, Gaomiao, Qichangzhan, Nanmatou, and Zhoujiadu, transporting passengers back and forth. The business is quite developed. The company employs thirty-six Chinese ticket sellers, nine ticket inspectors, and more than one hundred ferry captains and sailors. Recently, because the company's</p>
<p>Japanese Manager</p>
<p>Dingshi Shibata often used his power to beat and humiliate the Chinese employees, causing dissatisfaction. Yesterday morning, a sudden strike broke out by the entire workforce, and several demands were made, resulting in the originally scheduled 8:00 AM departure of each ferry being temporarily blocked. Passengers in the West Ferry of Pudong were also unable to cross the river. At 10:00 AM, the company expressed its willingness to compromise and first called the captains and others to start operations, while the ticket sellers and inspectors insisted that the manager must first</p>
<p>Sign a Guarantee</p>
<p>before they would resume work. Therefore, after the ferries resumed sailing at 10:00 AM, there were no ticket sellers, and the company dispatched more than ten internal Chinese and Japanese staff members to take their place. Due to the shortage of manpower, too many tickets were missed all day, resulting in considerable losses. It was not until 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon that the Japanese manager Shibata expressed his willingness to compromise again and</p>
<p>Sign and Acknowledge</p>
<p>the four demands of the Chinese employees on the spot: (1) No beating of Chinese employees; (2) Crew members can take turns leaving the ship outside of working hours, and ticket sellers and inspectors can return home after completing their work; (3) The company will study ways to increase wages; (4) No dismissal of Chinese employees without cause. The strike was resolved, and the ticket sellers and inspectors who left the ship are scheduled to return to work on the ship this morning.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Going to Southwest Set Date - Leaving Shanghai for Haiphong</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Parcel Post Has Been Restored</p>
<p>Ten Class B postal workers from the Shanghai Postal Administration requested the bureau to allow them to leave Shanghai to serve in the Southwest postal area. After being approved by the bureau, they completed the handover at the beginning of last week. It is now learned that the ten Class B postal workers are scheduled to depart on the 10th of this month, take a ship to Haiphong, and then transfer from Haiphong to various parts of the Southwest. Also, since the bulk commodity parcel post in Kaifeng was suspended a few days ago, it has recently been restored due to the recovery of transportation in the area. The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice saying, "From today, all parcels sent to Kaifeng or nearby areas can be accepted as usual. This is a special announcement." Also, regarding bulk parcels to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces and cities, it was originally intended to resume acceptance on May 8 (Monday), but due to the Haiphong Post Office being unable to transfer them, a telegram was sent to temporarily suspend the resumption. As for personal and pharmaceutical parcels, they can still be delivered as usual.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Protects - Peace Memorial Tower</h3>
<p>A certain Western organization in this city, in order to maintain the appearance of the Peace Memorial Tower on the Bund, sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau asking it to take measures to protect the tower and, if necessary, add a fence to prevent idlers from entering. The Public Works Bureau immediately dispatched police to guard the area and ordered the Public Works Department to maintain cleanliness. As for the organization's proposal to add a fence, it was decided to postpone it because it required a sum of 1,500 yuan, which was not included in this year's budget, and the fence might detract from the appearance. If the measures currently adopted are not effective within three months, it will be reconsidered at that time.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pigs Transported to Shanghai Detained Again - Pork Industry Insists on Not Yielding</h3>
<p>Pig Merchants Seriously Negotiate with Carrier Company - Cargo Volume of Foreign Vessels on the Yangtze River Plummets</p>
<p>The fresh pig industry, because fresh pigs have been robbed repeatedly, refused to pay the unnamed fees and did not yield to the pressure for days. Since the stalemate, pig traders, because they could not control the goods, regarded the transportation to Shanghai for sale as a dangerous journey, resulting in a shortage of fresh meat on the market and soaring prices. The meat industry has decided to refuse to sell pigs of unknown origin. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fresh Pigs Transported to Shanghai Detained Again</p>
<p>The pigs that arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, 517 fresh pigs transported by the Japanese ship Chiyo Maru and 472 fresh pigs transported by the Defeng Maru, were illegally detained by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. Pig merchants are still seriously negotiating with the carrier company. It is reported that a large number of goods from Jiafeng and Dechang in the incoming goods were also taken away. As a result, the cargo volume of foreign shipping companies on the Yangtze River plummeted. In fact, the transportation of fresh pigs cannot be carried out freely.</p>
<p>Refuse to Purchase Pigs of Unknown Origin</p>
<p>It is reported that someone was selling slaughtered white pork of unknown origin in the Xiaocai Market on Beijing Road the day before yesterday, and was scolded by passers-by as shameless. Also, Xie, the owner of Rongji Meat Shop, was persuaded by enthusiastic members for buying goods of unknown origin, which led to a conflict and the white meat was thrown on the ground. When the store owner reported the arrest to the scene, the storm was avoided. As for other meat industries, they have firmly refused fresh meat of unknown origin, and slaughterhouses have also stopped slaughtering these pigs.</p>
<h3>Public Relief Pawnshop - Actively Planning</h3>
<p>Methods of Implementation Being Drafted</p>
<p>Pawnshops are financial assistance institutions for the common people. The pawnshop industry in our country has always been subject to the traditional profit-making policy, which has led to the suspicion of exploitation and is criticized by society. Since the environment of Shanghai has changed and refugees have gathered, all sectors are trying to provide relief, and the industry has taken the opportunity to rise. High-interest pawnshops have increased endlessly. Previously, Mr. Ji Mingzhai and others suggested to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and requested the Ministry of Finance to set up a fair and relief-oriented public relief pawnshop. It is now learned that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has expressed his appreciation for this suggestion and has issued an instruction No. Yuqian Zi 2206, which roughly stated, "In addition to ordering pawnshops across the country to reduce interest rates and extend periods, and ordering the Farmers Bank to provide low-interest loans, as for the establishment of a public relief pawnshop in Shanghai, since the applicant has written to the Relief Association for handling, it will still be handled by the association." Now, Mr. Ji and others, according to the approval order, have written to the Relief Association to expedite the handling, and will discuss in detail with Mr. Hu Shouqi, a fundraising member of the association, to plan everything. It is reported that Mr. Hu believes that this measure will not only relieve the current economic situation of the common people, but also benefit the national economy, people's livelihood, social security, and peace. He is willing to be responsible for actively promoting it in order to achieve it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>French Cruiser - Leaves Shanghai and Sails Elsewhere</h3>
<p>The English-language "Greater America Evening Post" reports that the French colonial cruiser "Bayard" set sail from Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning (8th).</p>
<h3>The Visit of Lin Kanghou (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>He said that the market situation in Shanghai suffered a temporary slump in financial situation at the end of the year before last. However, thanks to the efforts of all parties, by the end of last year, in addition to new accounts without arrears, about 70% of old accounts had been repaid. The general business situation has greatly improved. As for the remittance system, it is indeed beneficial to finance. Then, he talked about the efficiency of China's currency system promotion. He said that Chinese society was originally a semi-cash system. Since the government implemented the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, it can be said that it was preparing to implement the legal currency policy. However, the necessary path was to abolish taels and adopt yuan, and then to abolish yuan and adopt legal currency. Now that the legal currency policy has been successful, it can adjust everything in this extraordinary period. The smooth circulation is indeed the most important page in the history of Chinese finance. He contributed to the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan and the implementation of legal currency at that time, and tried his best to promote it. He was modest and said that he was only doing his duty. He was very concerned about this newspaper. He said that the spirit of hard work of the "Shen Bao" now is admirable. Those who can work hard will surely be able to revive.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Mr. Lin about the way to establish oneself and live in the world. He said that his usual creed of self-discipline is: first, be careful in speaking and eating; second, be happy even in suffering; third, eat breakfast early, eat lunch full, and eat dinner less; fourth, do not make people afraid, but should make people love; fifth, having money but not using it is like managing accounts for others; wasting money is like having no money at all. It can be said that he goes everywhere for entertainment, but he does not go to things that are not beneficial to society. He believes that entertainment is a necessary adjustment to relax the body and mind, but he does not linger. He often recites Mencius's "Those who are capable will also do so," "Those who wait for King Wen to rise are ordinary people," "As for heroes, they will rise even without King Wen," "When heaven is about to entrust a great task to someone, it must first afflict his mind, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body, and empty his body" to encourage himself. When the reporter was talking to him, Mr. Lin recited it repeatedly, which also shows his firm belief in ancient precepts.</p>
<p>In addition to what the reporter knew, Mr. Lin also talked about his academic and service experience. Now, a summary is given below to show Mr. Lin's spirit of service:</p>
<p>He first studied with his father. The school was in the countryside, so his habits are simple. This comes from his understanding of the difficulty of farming. Then, he studied with his maternal uncle, Mr. Shen Xinqing. In his early years, he was a supplementary doctor's disciple. He studied in a certain surname's residence, earning 20 gold coins per section, a total of 60 gold coins per year, supplemented by the academy's scholarships (i.e., what is now called scholarships). Because the social economy was balanced in those days, and because of his thrift, his life was very affluent.</p>
<p>Before the Reform Movement of 1898, he already felt that China would not prosper unless it changed its laws. However, his views were different from those of the contemporary figures. At that time, the general advocates of reform believed that abolishing the imperial examination and establishing schools could immediately enrich the country and strengthen the army. However, his opinion was not to oppose abolishing the imperial examination and not establishing schools. He believed that abolishing the imperial examination was one thing, and establishing schools was another. The imperial examination itself was not for cultivation, but a tool for selecting talents. Schools are the institutions for cultivating talents. He believed that the reformers at that time used the abolition of the imperial examination to run schools as a tool for exercising political power. In fact, the people had no political training and did not understand the content of the reform, let alone the power to supervise and cooperate. The result was just scratching the surface.</p>
<h3>Women's Circles - Celebrated Mother's Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>Held Commemorative Meetings and Dinners Separately - And Visited Distressed Mothers in Shelters</p>
<p>Yesterday was International Mother's Day. The women's circles in this city celebrated enthusiastically. Women's groups held commemorative meetings and dinners separately and visited distressed mothers in shelters. All sectors expressed their unlimited respect for the lofty maternal love. The slogans for celebrating Mother's Day yesterday were as follows: (1) Chinese mothers are healthy, loving, diligent, and productive; (2) Chinese mothers are patriotic and love the community; (3) Modern mothers should have clean and hygienic habits and a happy and lively spirit; (4) Modern mothers should have the virtue of loving others and themselves and giving generously; (5) Modern mothers should love other people's children as much as their own children; (6) Modern mothers should advocate frugality and be accustomed to diligence, etc. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Celebration Meeting at International Shelter</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of Mother's Day. The First Shelter of the International Relief Committee on Masnan Road held a special entertainment celebration meeting. More than 300 mothers and their children participated in the grand event. Mrs. Yudan, Honorary President of the Commemorative Meeting, representatives of the Women's Relief Association and the female students of Daxia University, the director of the shelter, Pan Da, and all the Chinese and Western staff attended. Mr. Wang Wulin of Yumin Egg Factory donated one duck egg to each mother to show respect. The commemorative meeting distributed sweets. The Nursery for Laboring Refugees Participating in Production at the shelter also opened on the same day, and Mrs. Yudan cut the ribbon. There were many entertainment programs, including dramas and songs and dances. Mrs. Yu also gave a speech, which roughly stated, "China is now growing on the road to new life, so the task of mothers in the new China is even more important. The selfish psychology of raising children to wait for old age and storing grain to prevent famine in the past is gone. You are now offering your children to the country and the nation. Dear mothers of the new China, I would like to take this great anniversary to congratulate you on completing the great task of mothers in the new China, so that the new China will be realized sooner!" The entire audience was very moved and thanked her for her sincere sympathy for China and Chinese mothers. The event ended happily until after 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Wu Hufan and Chen Xiaodie Recruit Students for Poetry and Painting</h3>
<p>Wu and Chen's calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose have long been considered unparalleled in the art world. Recently, due to having ample free time while staying home and avoiding worldly affairs, they have decided to instruct students to broaden the passing on of their legacy. They have specifically established joint teaching regulations. The student quota is limited to fifty. Each month, students are required to compose four poems, write two essays, create four pages of calligraphy, and produce two paintings. They will receive face-to-face instruction once a week.

Anyone with a junior high school level of Chinese is eligible to study. Applicants should submit recent works, including their educational background, age, gender, and a four-inch photograph (those without a background in poetry or painting can submit a Chinese essay instead). Applications should be sent to the Family Industrial Society on Shanghai's Third Ma Road, to be forwarded to the Xuyuan Editorial Office, by June 1st, for compilation and assessment. Accepted applicants will be notified separately to complete the formalities, and instruction will officially begin on July 1st. Unaccepted applications will be returned. It is also reported that Tianxu Wosheng also approves of these regulations. Those who wish to study with Mr. Xuyuan can choose from the above four subjects, or, in the fields of literature or crafts, select their desired area of study and request instruction in writing. The monthly fee is ten yuan, payable three months in advance, and no assessment is required. Regardless of face-to-face or correspondence instruction, a maximum of two sessions per month will be provided.</p>
<h3>Guerilla Commander Yang Xingfang's Alleged Acceptance of a Puppet Position is Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>According to a visitor from Changyinsha, Yang Xingfang, the former guerilla commander of Chang County, has remained uninvolved in all external activities since a conflict with a certain guerilla unit last year. A recent report stated that a certain party appointed Yang as the "Pacification Commander" of the county. According to those close to Yang, this is purely speculation and not factual. It is rumored that a certain party has repeatedly sent people to persuade him, but Yang has refused each time. He has been living in seclusion, adopting a very passive attitude. Famous Calligrapher and Painter</p>
<h3>Famous Calligrapher and Painter Ms. Tan Manjia Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ms. Manjia, named Shu, is the daughter of Dean Tan Zuan. Her wall-engraved calligraphy is bold and simple, demonstrating the family's scholarly tradition. She also occasionally practices painting, capturing the essence of Qing Teng and Bai Yang. She has recently sought refuge in Shanghai, residing at No. 8, Lane 108, Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Members of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association have encouraged her to showcase her work to the public. Her uncle, Mr. Pingzhai, has already set the price list on her behalf. Wang's Disgraceful Falsification</p>
<h3>Forged Yi Bao Envelopes Sent Out "Giving An Example" Shows that Wang Jingwei's Examples are Fabricated</h3>
<p>A few readers of the Yi Bao newspaper yesterday each sent a forged envelope of the newspaper to the newspaper. Each envelope contained a printed piece titled "Giving An Example", which was written by Wang Jingwei and was previously denounced by Wu Zhihui. These forged envelopes, whether in terms of paper color, ink color, handwriting, or size, are completely different from the Yi Bao newspaper envelopes. The Yi Bao's real envelopes are pure white paper, while the forged envelopes are light pink. The Yi Bao's real envelopes are printed in vermilion red, while the forged envelopes are in magenta. Furthermore, the Yi Bao's real envelopes are wider than the forged ones, and the handwriting and arrangement of the words are also different. This kind of forgery is clearly intended to slander the Yi Bao and deceive its readers. In fact, the Yi Bao's position has long been known to the public, and no one will believe in such a thing. Instead, it exposes Wang Jingwei and his followers' habit of fabrication, making people suspect that the so-called examples in "Giving An Example" are all rumors and slander.</p>

<h3>The Cao Jiazhen Kidnapping Case: Bizarre Appeal Testimony</h3>
<p>Claiming Collusion with Cao to Swindle Money from His Mother. Cao Denies it Completely. The Trial is Concluded and Awaiting Judgment.</p>
<p>Cao Jiazhen, a 27-year-old from Ningbo Cixi, residing at No. 488, Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, French Concession, and working at the Datong Shipping Company at No. 207, Second Floor, Guangdong Bank on Jiangxi Road, was kidnapped at 6:00 PM on March 2nd of this year while returning home from work. Lin Xucen (29 years old, a former cosmetics dealer who lost his job after the war), a fellow townsman and classmate, colluded with his father, Lin Jinyou (67 years old), to</p>
<p>Design and Execute the Kidnapping</p>
<p>They hid Cao in the attic of Yangjian Elementary School at No. 9, Lane 1216, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Massenet. They then falsely used the name of He Hongda, the head of the Labor Iron Blood Corps, to send a letter to Cao's mother, Cao Qiu Shi, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Subsequently, after negotiating the ransom price over the phone, they agreed on 1,000 yuan. Later, Cao's maternal uncle, Qiu Youxin, reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to arrest Lin Xucen at the Danghu Inn in Huajin Lane, Shanxi Road, on the 5th of the same month, rescuing the hostage. They also</p>
<p>Arrested the Guarding Lin Father, Lin Jinyou, and Lin Sister, Lin Maoren, et al.</p>
<p>They were transferred to the Special Second Court, and the French Concession authorities filed a public lawsuit according to law. After the first trial, Lin Xucen was sentenced to ten years in prison, Lin Jinyou to seven years in prison, and both were deprived of their civil rights for the duration of their sentences. Lin Maoren was sentenced to three years and six months in prison and deprived of her civil rights for three years. Because the Lins did not accept the verdict, they appealed to the High Third Branch Court. During the appeal period, Lin Jinyou died in the detention center due to old age and illness.</p>
<p>Died of Illness</p>
<p>The details of each situation have been recorded in this newspaper. The High Third Branch Court held a trial yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the Third Criminal Court, presided over by Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Gu Hongbiao and He Jingcen, and Prosecutor Zhao Changmin. Appellant Lin Jinyou had passed away, and Lin Maoren was in custody and severely ill, unable to present her case. Only Lin Xucen was brought to trial. According to Lin's statement of the grounds for appeal, he stated that because he lost his job after the war, he had repeatedly asked Cao Jiazhen for loans last year.</p>
<p>In Order to Do Business</p>
<p>Cao agreed, but he had no money on hand. On March 2nd, I opened a room at the Asia Hotel and wrote a note with a fake name of "Chen" to have my father invite Cao to come and discuss the loan again. Cao arrived at the Asia Hotel after 6:00 PM, and my father accompanied him to my house. Cao said that he could not borrow money at the moment and asked me to write a threatening letter to his mother, pretending that Jiazhen had been kidnapped, but in reality, he was temporarily staying at my house, waiting for his mother to pay the ransom. Cao also asked me to make a phone call to his relatives and contact his mother.</p>
<p>On the Phone</p>
<p>We agreed on 1,000 yuan. Cao also stipulated that he would lend me the entire purchase money of 1,000 yuan or less, and I would return 100 yuan per month. If it was more than 1,000 yuan, Cao would take the excess. He also told me not to leak it to the outside world to avoid being reprimanded by his mother. Therefore, I followed his plan. The incident was discussed jointly with Cao Jiazhen, requesting a reduced sentence, etc. Cao Jiazhen was summoned to the court for questioning and flatly denied that he had discussed writing the letter with Lin. He said that Lin had lured him to his home and illegally detained him, and he did not know how they acted.</p>
<p>I Don't Know Anything</p>
<p>The witnesses, Zhang Pangen, the tea boy of the Asia Hotel, as well as Qiu Yue'e, Cao Saizhen, Cao Qiu Shi, and the investigating detective Zhong Benchang, were also summoned for questioning. At this point, the court ordered a debate on Lin Xucen's part first. After the prosecutor presented his opinion, Lin's defense lawyer and Yao Zhao Di, the lawyer of the French Concession authorities, debated each other. The court announced the conclusion and scheduled a sentence to be announced. The appellant was still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>The Assassination of Zhao Yongtao, Head of the Fake Armed Police</h3>
<p>Shot Five Times and Died on the Spot. Cang Daming was Injured by a Stray Bullet.</p>
<p>At approximately 9:45 AM yesterday morning, at the Daxi Tea House at No. 47, opposite the White Palace Funeral Home on Daxi Road, a man with glasses and a slightly pockmarked face entered and ordered tea. Not long after, three men followed him. One stood guard outside, and two went to the man's presence. One of them drew a box-type pistol and fired seven or eight shots in succession. The man was shot five times and died on the spot. The shooters, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, calmly dispersed. At that time, Cang Daming, who lived in a shed on Dunxin Road, was injured in the hand by a stray bullet and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the Jing'an Temple Road Police found several business cards near the deceased, with the words "Zhao Yongtao, Supervisor of the Qinfeng Refugee Cloth Factory in Fa Hua Town," as well as a badge. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Social News Agency, the deceased was indeed Zhao Yongtao, a native of Liuhe, Anhui, 37 years old this year. Before August 13th, he served as a platoon leader in the city's security team. After the National Army withdrew westward, he drifted to Shanghai and became a gangster. He had considerable influence in the Fahua Township area. Recently, Zhao suddenly assumed the position of captain of the armed police force of the puppet regime, setting up a team headquarters in the new house next to the Deji Clubhouse in the town. A month ago, one of his subordinate puppet police officers was also shot and killed, as reported in various newspapers. Unexpectedly, less than two weeks after the incident, Zhao himself was assassinated and killed. Therefore, after receiving the news yesterday, the Japanese military police stationed there conducted a house-to-house search in the nearby area in the afternoon, and it was reported that several innocent residents were arrested on the spot.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide Due to Unsuccessful Marriage</h3>
<p>Shi Desheng, a young man from Ningbo, just 20 years old and still studying, lived at No. 5, Tongshou Lane, Da Tong Road. At 7:10 PM yesterday, Shi suddenly went to the entrance of the Lafayette Theater on Rue Lafayette in the French Concession and secretly swallowed a large amount of poisonous liquid. After taking it, he went directly to the home of his cousin Zhao at No. 9, Wei Hou Lane. Zhao's family noticed that Shi's complexion was different, and after inquiring, they learned the truth and rushed him to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment. After the doctor's emergency treatment, his life was not in danger. As for the reason for Shi's suicide, it was because Shi's relative, Zhao, from Dinghai, Zhejiang, had a daughter named Ai Bao, 18 years old and quite beautiful. Shi intended to marry her, but was opposed by the girl's parents. Because of this, Shi was disappointed and suddenly had the idea of committing suicide.</p>
<h3>Huge Sum Robbed from Actor Chen Xiaomu's Home</h3>
<p>Chen Xiaomu, an actor, lives at No. 24, Le'an Lane, Route Cardinal Foch in West Shanghai. He is currently a leading "xusheng" (old male character) at the Grand Theater on Jiujiang Road. At around 7:30 AM yesterday morning, three bandits, each holding a pistol, rushed into the inner room while the servants were sweeping and cleaning, and held all the men and women captive. After a thorough search, the cash that Chen the actor had saved from his monthly hard-earned income, as well as his wife's jewelry, totaling more than 19,000 yuan, were all stolen. They fled out the door. Chen was unable to pursue them, so he reported to the police in charge and requested their arrest.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Extortion</h3>
<p>Pan Zhihu (26 years old), a native of Tongzhou, recently worked as a translator at the puppet "Police Station" on Linping Road in the Hongkou Chinese district. He has a mistress named Xu A'bao, who was recently introduced by Weng Jihai, a local residing at No. 71, Wuchang Road, to work as a prostitute in the brothel founded by a Russian woman, Ramanini, at No. 15, Bazizi Road, to earn a living. After Pan found out, he accompanied a certain foreigner with a pair of handcuffs and hired a car between the 22nd of last month and went to the Russian brothel on Bazizi Road and accused Xu A'bao of being abducted into the brothel by Weng (Weng is the chief steward at the Russian woman Ramanini's house). Without asking the circumstances, he handcuffed her and dragged her and Xu A'bao into the car, drove to the puppet bureau to detain her, and went to Weng Jihai's house and extorted 200 yuan from his wife, Chen. The case was exposed, and the Hongkou Police arrested and escorted him to the Special First Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Huang presided over the court yesterday and sentenced him to six months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Drugs Seized in the Kitchen. Three Offenders Punished Separately</h3>

So, they secretly went to the address at 7:20 PM yesterday and arrested Zhou Zhanxi from Henan, Shen Shixing, and Wang Wangshi, returning people, and seized 19 packets of heroin, 11.2 yuan in foreign currency, and white powder. They were all taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted according to the anti-drug regulations. When questioned, the defendants shirked their statements. Judge Fu sentenced Zhou Zhanxi to two years and eight months in prison for helping others to sell drugs and being a repeat offender. Wang Zai was sentenced to two months in prison for possessing drugs. Shen Shixing was innocent. The drugs and other items were confiscated according to regulations.</p>

<h3>After Cao Bingsheng's Death, the Funeral Will be Held This Afternoon. The Police Issued an Order Praising His Achievements</h3>

<p>Condolences from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Cao's coffin was enclosed yesterday afternoon at Wei Shi, and many people came to pay their respects. There were more than a thousand people, including celebrities Xue Dubi, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Jinghu, Xu Xiaochu, Tan Shaoliang, and Jiang Yiping. Before the coffin was enclosed, the guests lined up to look at the remains, and they all burst into tears sadly. Cao's wife, Ms. Sun Xueying, was so saddened that she fainted several times.</p>
<p>Funeral Today</p>
<p>Now, because there is no suitable burial place for Cao's coffin, it has been decided to temporarily place it in the Shanghai Funeral Home. The funeral will be officially held at 3:00 PM this afternoon. At that time, there will be a large number of roadside sacrifices. The French Police Department and various police stations will send representatives and detectives to attend the funeral. At the same time, the Public Concession Police Department will also send Political Minister Robertson and the music team to participate in the funeral procession.</p>
<p>Funeral Route</p>
<p>The funeral route was decided by Cao's house yesterday and is now recorded as follows: Starting from the Shanghai Funeral Home on Route Tenant de la Tour, go along Route Tenant de la Tour, go east along Rue Foch, pass Route Pichon (passing the Central Police Station), go north along Avenue Dubail, to Avenue Joffre, go west to Rue Pere Robert, go south to Avenue des Séverines, go west past Cao's residence, return to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Route Tenant de la Tour. The funeral procession includes monks and Taoists, a wreath team, embroidered flags, a mourning couplet team, a Qingyin team, the French Police Music Team, the Public Concession Music Team, the Shanghai Postal Service Music Team, and the Bloody Clothes Pavilion.</p>
<p>Issuance of Instructions</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 8th), the French Consul General issued an instruction, recalling Cao's loyal and brave service in the police station and the circumstances of his death. The following is an excerpt: "Mr. Cao Bingsheng was suddenly attacked by gangsters on the way to the police station at 7:30 AM on the 6th of this month. He was shot three times and died at Guangci Hospital on the same day due to serious injuries. Mr. Cao joined the police station on October 21, 1927, and was promoted to the position of Inspector General on January 1, 1938, due to his accumulated merits. He was awarded the French Public Works Bureau Medal on March 2, 1938. Mr. Cao's successive promotions were entirely due to his outstanding talents. His handling of affairs was decisive, loyal, and courageous, and no one can match him. Therefore, all those who worked with Mr. Cao were shocked and mourned his tragic death," etc.</p>
<p>Two Suspects</p>
<p>Wang Tingsheng, a Tianjin native who was suspected to be the most serious at the time of Cao's death, is currently undergoing treatment in the hospital due to injuries. It is rumored that Wang Shaokun was also captured in addition to Wang Tingsheng, which is a misunderstanding. The two Wangs are probably the same person. This Wang Tingsheng was captured because he hit the electric pole on the side of the road while trying to escape and fell to the ground, where he was shot. His injuries have not yet healed, so he has not been formally interrogated. As for the issue of Cao's compensation, the French authorities are now weighing the situation, and the police department is also selecting personnel for the successor.</p>

<h3>Heming Shoes and Hats Branch Opens</h3>
<p>The Heming Shoes and Hats Store in Baxianqiao has now expanded its business and specially opened a branch at the east end of Nanjing Road Shilu.

More Shangying movie stars Tan Ying, Bai Yan, and Lu Luming personally cut the ribbon.

On that day, the main and branch stores held a commemorative cheap sale at the same time, and the operating income reached more than 10,000 gold.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor: I saw a news item on page 10 of the third edition of your newspaper yesterday entitled "The Iron Industry Public Association Donates Achievements," which stated that "steel bars and scrap iron totaled more than 800 yuan in March and April," which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. According to the investigation, the association's total for March was 774 yuan and 8 jiao and 9 fen, which has been submitted to the Relief Association. The income for April has just been collected, totaling 1,885 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen, which is still in the accounting period and has not yet been submitted to the Relief Association. It will be sent tomorrow. Therefore, I would like to request a correction to be used as a basis for the WeChat account. To the editor of the scarf newspaper, Shanghai Steel Bar and Scrap Iron Association, May 8,</p>
<h3>The Husband and His Sister-in-Law Live Together, Claiming to Have the Wife's Consent, Hoping to Curb Her Prodigal Behavior. The Accused Was Released on Bail After an Appeal and Interrogation.</h3>
<p>Xia Changyu, a native of Wuxi, 30 years old this year, was in the money shop business in Suzhou. He decided to bring his wife, Xia Xuehuai Shan (31 years old), to Shanghai to avoid the disaster and lived at No. 25, Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. Because Xia had been in love with his wife's younger sister, Xue Qi (24 years old), for a long time, he rented a house with her at No. 12, Gujia Lane, Hualong Road in the French Concession. On the morning of the 5th of last month, Xia's wife suddenly reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to</p>
<p>Live Together and Commit Adultery</p>
<p>Xia and Xue Qi were arrested and escorted to the Special Second Court. The French Concession authorities filed a lawsuit according to law. After the trial, each was sentenced to four months in prison. During the appeal period, they were detained in the detention center awaiting review. Xia and others did not accept the verdict and hired lawyer Wang Shizong to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. On the one hand, because he was ill in custody, he requested bail from the original court, and the ruling was</p>
<p>Rejection of Application</p>
<p>The case was also appealed to the High Third Branch Court. The hearing was held yesterday morning by Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the High Third Branch Court, along with Judges Gu and He. Xia Changyu stated the grounds for his appeal, saying that because his wife was dissolute outside, she used her sister to have a relationship with me in the 25th year to curb my dissoluteness outside, which had long been</p>
<p>Approved by His Wife</p>
<p>I live with her sister, and my parents-in-law were alive at that time, and they all knew about it. This sudden accusation has another purpose. Xue Qi said, I have a relationship and live with my brother-in-law, which was allowed by my sister and parents, and I often go back and forth with my sister, and it has been a long time, and so on. After the plaintiff, Xia Xuehuai Shan, was summoned to the court, he was informed that the conclusion would be announced and the sentence would be pronounced in ten days. The two defendants were each released on bail with a security deposit of 100 yuan, subject to the responsibility of the defense lawyer.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong is sunny and hot, with southeast to southwest winds. This area has northeast to southeast winds and morning fog. The East China Sea will change from cloudy to overcast, with strong north to east winds. There is a cyclone in southern Japan, with heavy storms due to the hurricane moving northeast. The center of the hurricane was at 31 degrees north latitude and 135 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM, within 60 miles, but the wind force is unknown. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 76.8 degrees and the lowest was 54.1 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 80.6 degrees and the lowest was 57.9 degrees.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Study of the Brain and Electricity</h3>
<p>— Qu Shaoheng</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's instructions can be heard clearly by the people on the isolated island even when he is tens of thousands of miles away. Airplanes can be tracked hundreds of miles away. Is this not the power of electrical science? Therefore, it is said that the 20th century is the electrical world. I have long aspired to explore the ultimate truth of the relationship between the brain and electricity. I once said to people that the human body has electricity, which can be proven by the hair and skin. Everyone with a little scientific knowledge knows this. In the human brain, regardless of intelligence or stupidity, virtue or vice, there are electrical receiving and transmitting mechanisms. For example, if A thinks of B and goes to visit him, the electrical waves emitted from A's brain gradually reach the electrical receiving center in B's brain, causing a response. Then B's idea of A suddenly arises at the same time. This kind of thought is not contrary to the principles of electricity. It is a pity that I have not been able to conduct further research. Recently, I read Bergier's theory, which can be used to verify my ideals. He said that the human brain has electricity. It can be proved by using hair as a conductor to conduct experiments. There are two kinds of current with different wavelengths of vibration. One is a regular and never-changing current. The vibration number of this current is 8 to 12 times per second. The other is an irregular current with very drastic changes. Its vibration number actually exceeds the former's by a hundred times. It vibrates over a thousand times per second. Bergier called the former "alpha" (α) wave and the latter "beta" (β) wave. "The α wave is the same for everyone, regardless of intelligence or weakness, just like the human body temperature, which is 37 degrees regardless of gender or age. "The β wave is not like this at all. It is usually not seen flowing in the human brain. When the person's mental or emotional activity is tense, the "β current begins to circulate in the brain and covers the standby α wave. This is like when a high fever rises, the normal temperature is covered by the high fever. Moreover, the time for the "β" wave to circulate in the brain cannot last long. After a long time, people will not be able to support it. This is like the human body cannot withstand high fever for a long time. Therefore, the action of the "β wave is really or rise or fall, and there is no fixed rule. Bergier's theory is like this, which coincides with my so-called electrical induction of the human brain. Moreover, it is consistent with Bergier's idea of the alpha wave. I would like to discuss it with those who are interested in electrical science.</p>
<p>Popular Medical Talks</p>
<h3>On Dantian Breathing and Health</h3>
<p>— Wang Yugang</p>
<p>According to the position of the Dantian as usually referred to, it is in the lower abdomen. This kind of breathing style, in the Taoist and martial arts practitioners' internal cultivation, is said to be very important, but I who do not know the methods and martial arts, it is difficult to glimpse the reasons why they attach importance to it, but from the physiological effects of our medical aspects to explore, we can say something about the relationship between Dantian breathing and human health.</p>
<p>Physiologically speaking, the types of human breathing movements can be divided into two types: one is called thoracic breathing, which relies on the expansion and contraction of the rib muscles to expand and contract the chest cavity, and the other is called abdominal breathing, which relies on the expansion and contraction of the abdominal muscles to expand and contract the abdominal wall. Generally, men use abdominal breathing more, and women use thoracic breathing more, and in the supine position, both men and women become thoracoabdominal. According to the Dantian position in the lower abdomen, the Dantian breathing belongs to abdominal breathing undoubtedly, but its meaning is to make the abdominal breathing movement fully developed to the lower abdomen, so that its function is fully exerted to the entire abdominal cavity.</p>
<p>In recent years, many people have noticed deep breathing exercises. Deep breathing exercises are generally considered to refer specifically to strenuous thoracic breathing, and do not contain the meaning of strenuous abdominal breathing. This is the negligence and vulgarity of people in physiology and hygiene. We should try our best to correct and promote it. Why? Because strenuous thoracic breathing can make the blood circulation in the lungs and heart in the chest cavity smooth, the metabolism is prosperous, so the lungs are healthy, the resistance is strong, and it is not easy to get sick. This is indeed a correct principle. But there are many organs in the abdominal cavity? Is it not necessary for the blood flow to be smooth, and the metabolism to be prosperous, so the matter of strenuous abdominal breathing of the same deep breathing exercise is completely ignored. Otherwise, we should advocate Dantian breathing, which should be as important as strenuous thoracic breathing, and perhaps even more meaningful. This is not an overstatement, scaring the sky, wanting to gain unexpected effects, the fact is so, the physiological function of the respiratory organs is simple, only serving the function of absorbing oxygen and exhaling carbon, while the physiological functions of the organs in the abdominal cavity are complex, more than the lungs are doubled, so it is necessary to strengthen, among which the most effective is the digestive system. To give an example, I usually say to patients with habitual constipation that laxatives should not be taken regularly. If you want to correct this disease, there is a simple method. After going to bed every night, take a steady supine position, perform strenuous abdominal breathing forty or fifty times, which can reach the Dantian is better. Do it once in the same way before getting up in the morning the next day. As a result, habitual constipation can be eliminated, daily bowel movements are smooth, and at the same time appetite is increased, and digestion is good. This is an experienced fact. Patients may wish to try it. But people with stomach ulcers or appendicitis, or nephritis should not try it, otherwise there is a danger of inducing the disease. According to this fact, the beneficial effect of abdominal breathing on the abdominal organs is very significant.</p>
<p>German Kiehl-Neinel placed a suction cup Saugglocke on the abdominal wall to perform suction and extrusion movements to change the activity of intra-abdominal pressure, which is nothing more than this meaning. As a result, in addition to the digestive organs being well affected, for patients with circulatory disorders, it can lower blood pressure and slow down the pulse, but I think using a suction cup to change the abdominal pressure is too clumsy, and it is much more natural and simple to use strenuous abdominal breathing.</p>
<p>Common Sense of Food Cultivation</p>
<h3>Scientific Research on Food Cultivation (Continued from Issue 15)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>CO2+H2O+Sunlight+Chlorophyll→H2CO3</p>
<p>Carbon Oxygen Two Water Carbonic Acid</p>
<p>H2CO3+Sunlight+Chlorophyll→H.CHO.O2</p>
<p>Carbonic Acid Middle Oxygen (Freely Separated)</p>
<p>6(H.CHO)+Sunlight+Chlorophyll→C6H12O6</p>
<p>Six Methyl Thio Glucose (Carbohydrate)</p>
<p>After research by many people, it is known that it is the effect of ultraviolet light. Now it can be imitated with artificial sunlight, so it has been proven undoubtedly. In plants, this photochemical effect is called Photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Plants take shape by means of photochemical construction, so that our food is cultivated. Therefore, the heat of sunlight is indirectly transmitted to the human body, and this is method one. The life of livestock also depends on plants, because what animals need is also what humans need. However, humans are the spirits of all things, so they have special abilities to use them as food to supplement the needs of the body. Therefore, the heat of sunlight is transmitted to humans, and this is method two. Therefore, the greatness of the benefits of sunlight to mankind is indeed something that we have not been able to anticipate.</p>
<p>People in the world have their own innate responsibilities. Due to the different responsibilities, the lightness and heaviness of the operations are different, and therefore the food cultivation is also different. Now that we know the source of heat and the method of measuring it, we dare to discuss it separately according to the amount of heat.</p>
<p>For men of medium height from youth to middle age, if there is no labor, the food cultivation is enough to meet the needs of the body, and the daily requirement is 2,000 calories. If it is a slight operation, such as walking, etc., then you need to add one or two thousand more. A man of medium height refers to a body weight of seventy kilograms, which is equivalent to one hundred and fifty-four pounds. People with heavier or lighter body weight can increase or decrease their food cultivation if their operations do not change much, or calculate it proportionally according to their body weight (details separately).</p>
<p>The weight of ordinary women accounts for four-fifths of that of men, which is equivalent to 80% of the calculation. Although the operations of men and women are the same, the amount of heat used only accounts for four-fifths of that of men. This is because the basic metabolic rate of women is 5% lower than that of men. This difference may be due to the percentage of fat contained in the body. For example, a tall and thin man has the same weight as a short and strong man, but their basic metabolic rates are not equal, so the thin man eats more, and his thinness remains the same, while the short and strong man becomes fatter. The basic metabolic rate will be detailed separately, and will not be repeated here. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance: Cash Rush Expands Due to Absorption from It</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market situation was bleak. Under the cover of buying interest, the rising wind suddenly expanded, and the market situation became chaotic again. It even broke through the two levels of 2,120 yuan and 30 yuan in succession. It once reached a peak of 2,134 yuan. It was actually because of rumors in the market that "Huaxing Bank" was about to open, and there were rumors that it was secretly buying gold. Therefore, the hearts of all parties were suddenly agitated. A certain gold shop continued to vigorously advance for the South China Gang without slackening, and the securities gang also bought more and sold less. Moreover, a certain money exchange industry bought a large amount for customers, so although the silver shop gang and the gold shop sold, the supply and demand quantity was still very different, which led to the price rising to the peak. However, before the evening closing, many long positions took advantage of the high price to close out profits, so there was a slight reversal. In the end, it rose sharply by 18 yuan, and the transaction was very prosperous, reaching 1,570 taels for the whole day. Silver jewelry also rose by 2 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Jumps 18 Yuan</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, each bar of fifty taels, the initial opening was quite flat. First, the silver shop gang mutually traded fifty taels, with 2,120 yuan as the opening price, which was 7 yuan higher than the noon transaction price on the previous weekend. After opening, the silver shop gang forked into the money exchange industry for fifty taels, the price was the same as the morning opening. Then the cash shop mutually traded fifty taels, the price was 19 yuan. Later, the securities gang also stuffed the money exchange industry and the gold shop with fifty taels each, the price was 18 yuan each. After this, although a certain gold shop bought a large amount for customers, the silver shop gang and the gold shop frequently stuffed it vigorously, resulting in a stable situation. A certain gold shop entered the silver shop gang for a total of 200 taels, and the price was the same. Then they entered the same industry for 200 taels, and the price was also 18 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry mutually traded 70 taels, and the price was still 18 yuan. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange futures were soft, and someone secretly moved, and the hearts of the people were suddenly agitated. A certain money exchange industry's absorption turned stronger, and the securities gang also came to vigorously advance, and the market situation suddenly became prosperous, rushing out of the 20 yuan level. A certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels, and the price was 19 yuan. They also entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, and the price was 20 yuan. A certain silver shop also absorbed 50 taels of the same industry for customers, and the price jumped by 5 yuan to 25 yuan. A certain money exchange industry re-entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, and the price was 27 yuan. Later, the securities gang entered a certain gold shop for 100 taels, and the price was 28 yuan. At the same price, they entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, and then entered a certain money exchange industry for 50 taels, and the price was 27 yuan. Before long, the money exchange industry transferred and re-entered the same industry for 50 taels, and the price was 26 yuan. After this, the buying wind gradually weakened, and retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, so they moved downwards. The money exchange industry sold 50 taels to the gold shop, and the counterfeit noon closing price was 22 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange industry continued to vigorously advance, the rising wind re-ignited. The initial opening was raised by 6 yuan, and then a certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels, the price was 28 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop entered the money exchange industry for 50 taels, and the price was 29 yuan. Soon after, they entered the money exchange industry for 50 taels again, and the price was 32 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry and the securities gang successively vigorously entered more than 100 taels, and the price rose to 34 yuan, all supplied by the money exchange industry and the gold shop. At that time, many floating households took advantage of the high price to sell out profits, so they returned slightly. The money exchange industry sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang, and the price was 31 yuan. After this, although the sellers reduced to 28 or 9 yuan, it was difficult to open because the entrants were waiting and watching. Therefore, the evening closing was still 2,131 yuan. As a result, it rose by 18 yuan compared with the noon closing on the previous Saturday, with a difference of 16 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,135 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,120 yuan. The current marked gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. Both were not opened.</p>
<p>Jewelry Listed Up 2 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver jewelry per tael in the silver shop was not changed. At 9:45, Datonghang listed 1 yuan higher because the price of raw gold had risen to the 2,120 yuan level. Later, at 10:20, Datonghang listed 1 yuan higher again because the market situation of raw gold was even stronger. At the same time, Xintonghang also listed 1 yuan higher. After this, there were no changes. Datonghang changed to suspend 216 yuan, Xintonghang was 214 yuan, and the purchase price was 208 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Unmoved</p>
<p>The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese cash remained stagnant at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed Customs gold remained flat, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 li, and 6 hao. The Shanghai standard marked gold price also did not change, calculated at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao. This was due to the London telegram on the 6th that British pure gold was still stable at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Oil and Cotton Settle Accounts</h3>
<p>Futures Slightly Tightened</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was turbulent because oil companies, Asiatica, and cotton merchants settled their accounts, and Chinese speculators also followed suit. Moreover, the Bank of England was profitable (on behalf of the Tianjin gang), and Japanese banks also competed to vigorously buy U.S. dollar futures. However, foreign banks such as British and American banks were willing to supply cash at the maintained price, but they were less willing to supply futures. As a result, the situation showed a flat cash and soft futures. In the middle, foreign firms bought U.S. dollars for cash and hedged July futures, with a premium of 2 and a half jiao per U.S. dollar, calculated as a monthly interest rate of 5 li excluding commissions. However, it was still difficult to arouse the interest of wealthy arbitrageurs. The day's trading was quite strong. Initially, the Hong Kong dollar was hard because the money exchange industry had a strong desire to sell, but it returned to flat after foreign firms frequently absorbed it. In the end, there was still no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars were long or short by 125, and New York's silver price was stagnant as before. London's raw gold was also flat. The exchange rates of British dollar against U.S. dollar, against Shanghai dollar, and against French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar against British dollar, against Shanghai dollar, and against French franc also remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. The bank's morning opening selling prices for cash were 8 pence 25 for the British dollar and 16 yuan 0625 for the U.S. dollar, which were the same as the previous weekend's noon closing. After opening, although the settlement of accounts for cotton was quite frequent, and Chinese speculators also followed suit, there was no change because various foreign banks such as British and American banks also had a strong desire to supply. Foreign firms settled HSBC and McCallum cash British dollars at 8 pence 25. Then they and Chinese speculators successively settled accounts. A certain bank's U.S. dollar cash was 16 yuan 0625. When HSBC's listing was announced, it did not move, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be 7 and a half li, calculated as 7.00%. After this, the oil company Asiatica also purchased and settled HSBC's July British dollars at 8 pence 125. Later, the Bank of England (on behalf of the Tianjin gang) also absorbed the Dutch bank's July U.S. dollars at 15 yuan 8125. At that time, Japanese banks also purchased and settled the foreign firm's July U.S. dollars at 15 yuan 8125. Therefore, the futures situation was slightly soft. Near noon, foreign bank Ander Holland absorbed the money exchange industry's Hong Kong dollar cash at 55 yuan 875. The situation was still flat at that time. Soon after, foreign bank Naville turned weak and was willing to supply the above absorption price, so the potential was slightly hard. At the noon closing, the bank's cash selling prices for both British and U.S. dollars were no different from the morning opening. The Hong Kong dollar was 55 yuan 875.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Bank of England continued to settle HSBC British dollars for cash at 8 pence 25 on behalf of the Tianjin gang. It then settled a certain bank's U.S. dollars at 16 yuan 0625 with HuaBee. The process remained unchanged. After entering, foreign firms purchased and settled Dutch and Ander cash Hong Kong dollars at 55 yuan 75. The situation returned to flat. At the evening closing, the bank's cash selling prices were 8 pence 25 for the British dollar, 16 yuan 0625 for the U.S. dollar, and 55 yuan 75 for the Hong Kong dollar. As a result, there was no honor or disgrace for the British, U.S., and Hong Kong dollars compared with the previous weekend's noon closing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange in this port was settled very heavily by foreign firms, such as yarn and flower gangs, Japanese banks, Asiatica, etc., which absorbed quite strongly. Fortunately, foreign banks supplied smoothly. The changes in raw gold were sudden. Money exchange customers, etc., absorbed very strongly. The market price rose sharply. It was heard that it was absorbing on behalf of the Tianjin gang and the local counterfeit Huaxing Bank. Near noon, gold shops took advantage of the high price to sell. In the afternoon, money exchanges purchased and absorbed the recovery, and the supply was not smooth. The market price rose very sharply. The demand for foreign currency British and American gold pounds recovered strongly. The market price followed the high rise in raw gold and became expensive. The supply and demand of British and American gold notes were quite smooth. The demand for Hong Kong notes and Annam notes was quite strong, and the price trended upward. It was heard that it was needed by civil servants going to the southwest and passing through Hong Kong and Vietnam. Only French franc notes were supplied more heavily, and the price dropped slightly. The public association's transactions were not strong. Chengtai sold and Yongtai bought Singapore notes for 400 yuan. Sentai sold and Qintai bought Hong Kong notes for 1,000 yuan. Chengtai sold and Qintai bought Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 jiao, Hong Kong notes rose by 5 li, French franc notes fell by 7 hao and a half, Annam notes rose by 1 fen, and the others remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Food - The Key to the Rice Market</h3>
<p>According to the current situation, it is not a matter of supply and demand. As long as there is strict management and fair distribution, rice prices should return to normal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was still chaotic. Northern japonica rice was not sampled at all, and southern japonica and Bo Dao rice were also very few on the market. Most of them were old stocks. Market prices were all in accordance with the price limit. Therefore, stores could not buy high-quality goods. At the same time, Du Yang wharf sharp rice was still out of stock. Only the Zhongguan sharp rice under Ying jurisdiction poured out in large quantities, and the price was also 14 yuan. If second-class rice such as 硠米 were sold, the price would reach 15 yuan and 45 cents. Because the black market was not restricted, it gradually soared. High-quality goods have been priced at 21 yuan, and medium-quality goods have also reached 20 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>For this rise in rice prices, rice merchants publicized it widely, blaming hoarders for not releasing the rice. It is true that most of the rice hoarders are silver and money businesses and wealthy merchants. These people usually eat goods that are more expensive than rice, and they do not know the suffering of ordinary people who buy rice. Therefore, they only hope that the price will be high, and the higher the price, the more they will gain and the better they will enjoy. It is difficult to believe that rice merchants can really think for the people's food. Because the arrival of goods has not been cut off, and there are goods coming from the He Xia carts, why are they unwilling to sell at the price limit, but instead shout high prices and break through the price limit? Therefore, according to the current rice market situation, there is sufficient rice in storage, and the arrival of goods is constant. It cannot be said that the relationship between supply and demand is unbalanced. It is all because of the hoarding and profiteering of hoarders, the manipulation of rice merchants in the name of others, and the unwillingness of vendors to sample. In a word, everyone wants to make a fortune from the people's food. This kind of situation is not difficult to break, and it can be brought back to the right track. As long as there is strict management and fair distribution, hoarders, rice merchants, and vendors will not be without profit, and the people's food will not be difficult. Rice merchants can blame hoarders, and hoarders can blame rice merchants. Even if the rice of hoarders is all in the hands of rice merchants, can we guarantee that there will be no manipulation and monopoly? Who really believes it? However, to achieve these two points, the industry association alone cannot achieve it, which is also inevitable.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has gradually increased in the continuous rise of rice prices. Yesterday, the retail and wholesale of Saigon rice were all reported to have risen. High-quality old Saigon rice was priced at 19 yuan and 23 cents, and the transaction price was also around 19 yuan. Therefore, yesterday grain merchants had contacted foreign firms to inquire about prices by telegram. According to the telegram at the end of last week, the price was about 20 yuan, which was less than one yuan away from the Shanghai price. If the Shanghai market continues to rise and the production price is slightly flat, then the order can be approached. It is heard that the Ningbo gang is also in contact with 50,000 bags. Yesterday, 790 bags of rice came from Hong Kong and 200 bags of rice came from Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Yesterday, high-quality indica rice was not sold on the market, and Wuxiang rice, which was limited to 14 yuan, was also of great market quality. The Wuxiang rice also reached 13 yuan and 78 cents, and the Po Xiang rice was 13 yuan and 45 cents. The newly arrived Yuzhou coarse indica rice was priced at 11 yuan and 8 cents. In terms of selling price, high-quality indica rice was still 56 cents short. Yesterday morning, there were still new hoarders asking about it, so medium and second-class goods continued to see a hidden increase. In the afternoon market, the market hoarders took advantage of the high late hands, and the later market saw a return. The total daily turnover was 56700 bags.</p>
<h3>Flour - Another Wave of Price Increases</h3>
<p>The wholesale price of this street has increased by five cents. A large batch of foreign flour is directly transported to other ports - factory flour.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another wave of price increases occurred in the flour market. The wholesale price of No. 2 flour factory in this street increased by five cents, the same as the customer price of 4 yuan and 5 and a half cents in cash. The difference between the wholesale price of this street and the customer gang has been several days. Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and each factory shouted high prices on the opening day due to the high price of raw materials and insufficient flour reserves. However, the sales market of the customer gang was flat, and the Beiyang gang had foreign flour to handle due to the exchange rate relationship, so they had no intention of taking more in the new transaction, only sporadic embellishments and adding thousands of bags of No. 3 and No. 4 flour. Therefore, the customer price could not be increased again, only the wholesale price in this street was increased to show consistency. The total market turnover of various brands of flour was about 50,000 bags. In addition to the transaction between this customer, the retail sales of the inland gang have not been lonely recently, so the market may still be optimistic. It is found that 11,200 bags of flour were exported today, heading to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour</p>
<p>The market situation of foreign flour continued to be calm. It is found that except for a part of the new arrivals that are waiting for the price to sell, a large number of arrivals are directly transferred to North China and other places, and transported and sold to other ports. Therefore, the supply of market sources is still scarce, and the freight side insists as before. The price of medium-grade brands is 4 yuan and 5 and a half cents in cash, including the cost, which is similar to the selling price of this factory's flour. The foreign production price is still high, and the scheduled foreign flour is priced at 2 yuan and 8 cents in US dollars. However, the market rumor has a 4 yuan and 4 and a half cents scheduled foreign flour for sale, but no transaction has been heard.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake - In Two Weeks, Soybeans Have Fallen Sharply by Nine Yuan - Scheduled and Spot Cakes Have Also Fallen</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil</p>
<p>Since the futures sale was stopped, the Japanese side has entered a state of rest. Therefore, general speculators lack the skills to fuel the flames. Under the situation that spot oil is coming to Shanghai in a continuous stream, the sales market has suddenly become sluggish. In these two weeks, soybean oil has fallen by a total of nine yuan. This kind of wind and rain storm-like rise and fall is justified by the special environment, and the industry is also actively working to say that there is no manipulation, who can believe it? Yesterday, there was no transaction in peanut oil. Only 120 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, and the price fell from 40 yuan and 8 cents to 40 yuan at the close. The sales market was in the mainland of this street.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 5,000 cans of raw oil came from Hong Kong, and 2,700 bags of soybeans came from Tianjin, and 2,200 bags came from Yantai. Today, 600 bags are being transported to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake</p>
<p>The transaction is still only for Dalian goods. Although the spot cake is not in a time of large-scale digestion, the retail sales are still uninterrupted. The market situation only had fractional ups and downs in the score last week. Yesterday, the market fell because the June futures cake fell by 3 cents, causing the lower end to be affected. The transaction only settled 1,000 pieces of Shimei brand, the price was 2 yuan and 8 cents and a half, which was also 3 cents lower than last Saturday. The futures cake also only had transactions in June. Yesterday's market price fell from 3 yuan and 2 and a half cents (specifying Yuanji brand delivery) to 3 yuan and 5 cents, with a total turnover of 7,000 pieces. The price for the delivery of miscellaneous brand cakes was 3 yuan to 2 yuan and 9 cents and 8 cents, with a turnover of 2,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Securities - Bond Market Does Not Get Rid of Sideways Movement</h3>
<p>The black market for securities remained sideways yesterday. In the morning, it turned from flat to firm, then gradually weakened. In the afternoon, it turned from flat to weak, then slightly firmer again. However, the range of highs and lows was only between one and one and a half cents. The trend was completely caused by people's confusion and the unwillingness of both bulls and bears to give way, which led to this stagnant situation. If there is no significant change in the environment, the market price will not have huge ups and downs. Yesterday, the sellers who opened the market included No. 14, 38, 11 and Dafeng Shunli, and the buyers included Datong Tongkang and No. 20. The market price weakened slightly and then rose, and firmed slightly and then fell, and finally remained sideways between one cent. The afternoon trading was very clear, only Dingzhong had more transactions due to the lottery relationship. This kind of government bond was the last day before the seventh lottery, and the lottery will be held on the 10th, so there were more buyers. Yongfeng and No. 42 slightly absorbed, and Tiansheng Runli slightly released. The market price was still flat and unremarkable, and the result was still inconsistent in highs and lows, and the turnover was only more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Today is the 59th National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<p>In stock trading, more than 70 shares of Huashang Electric shares were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 5 cents, slightly firmer than before by one cent.</p>
<p>The stock market of Zhongye Gongsuo is the most firm in several selected stocks, such as the Yesong stock and the Ruiteng stock, because it is expected that there will be good dividends, resulting in new high goods, and the Ruiteng stock has a huge turnover. The public bus stock also rose to a new high price of 30 yuan. The reclamation stock transaction is also smooth, but the price does not rise and fall greatly. The Shanghai Silver Company stock is dim, the Jardine stock is calm, and the rubber stock is difficult to trade, because the buying price and the selling price are too far apart.</p>
<p>The ordinary shares of China Business Company saw a turnover of 3 cents today. However, according to its reorganization plan, the 8% bonds should be worth 79 taels, while the turnover on Saturday was only 56 taels. It is unknown whether the value of ordinary shares is too high or the value of 8% bonds is too low. Therefore, it is very surprising, but there is no doubt that it will be worth the same in the future.</p>
<h3>Please See How Difficult Life Is Today</h3>
<p>Meat is expensive... Those who can eat meat may not feel it is expensive. It is also expensive... Therefore, ordinary people feel great pain in life.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th War in Shanghai, people's lives have suddenly increased. In addition to the sharp rise in rents due to the sudden increase in population, the daily necessities in the family have also continued to rise. As for the food necessary for life, such as rice, vegetables, and "the seven things to open the door, firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea", none of them have not risen. For example, the fresh meat of meat dishes and the essence of legs are one yuan per catty, and you can only buy one catty and two liang for each yuan in the middle rib, and each live chicken is one catty, two or three liang per yuan, and fresh fish also costs from three or four cents to eight or nine cents per catty. As for the cheapest vegetarian food that ordinary people regard as "bean sprouts and salted vegetable tofu" and other things, the price of raw materials such as soybeans and raw soybean oil is now soaring due to the manipulation of the Japanese. In early spring of this year, 5 catties and 7 or 8 taels of raw soybean oil could be bought for each yuan, but now only less than 3 catties can be bought, so the cheapest food is not cheap now. The recent price increases of food are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>(1) The price of each item in the Tofu shop (unit corner)</p>
<p>(2) The selling price of each item in the Noodle shop (unit text)</p>
<p>(3) The cheapest vegetarian dishes in the vegetable market (unit corner)</p>
<p>The selling price of the above-listed vegetarian dishes has increased by two-thirds compared with before the war, and some have doubled. For example, tofu was sold for ten texts per piece before, but now it costs twenty texts. Dried tofu was fifteen texts per piece, and now it is sold for thirty texts. Salted vegetables and bean sprouts can be bought for at least forty or fifty texts, but now it costs at least four or five cents. The hardship of the public's life is all given by the invaders.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers - More Than One Slice of the Cutting Knot Sound Now, the Yarn Price Plunges Ten Yuan - There Is a Feeling That Yesterday Was Right and Today Is Wrong</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be tired and the falling wind rose again. Although the actual demand was more than the previous day, there was still no huge development. In addition, some bigwigs were thinking about the possibility of a callback, and after the first-class fell cheaply, they would buy it again. Therefore, people's hearts were flat, and the market went down in a roundabout way. The eastern Zhejiang Wenzhou area has already started to transport by wheel. It must wait for it to return to Shanghai. If the road is safe, there may be a better business improvement in the middle of this week. Therefore, the current mainstream opinion is to hold a hopeful attitude. In the afternoon, the virtual wind suddenly rose, and the decline was rapid. The floating more than saw the bad environment and all cut the knot. The 20-count double horse foreign warehouse goods fell below the 420 yuan mark, and the warehouse single goods also tracked down, entering the 10 yuan mark. In this situation, it can be imagined that the operators are confused. It has created a situation of rapid advance and retreat.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation, at the beginning of the morning, colleagues gathered together, and the discussion was weak. Because the actual needs of all roads were cold, there was no telegram commission, and the market was showing a hesitant trend. The opening fell by one and a half yuan, and the price of 20-count Bianma warehouse single was 416 yuan. However, since the spot price was tired, the purchasers were even more rare, and the price was 423 yuan. After a while, the general mobile brokers shouted and sold in the market like an auction. The market gradually declined. By the time the market closed, the spot price was 418 yuan, and the warehouse single price was 412 yuan and a half. When the market opened in the afternoon, the sellers gathered, and the buyers were scattered and unbearable. The 20-count Te Jincheng spot yarn Yunnan gang entered 20 packages, and the price was 8 yuan lower than the morning price. People's hearts suddenly became fearful, and a selling wind suddenly rose, and the selling price continued to fall. The closing price of Shuangma spot was 415 yuan, and the warehouse single price was 406 yuan and a half. This kind of falling wind is too violent to avoid. In fact, the price increase in the past was excessive, and yesterday's reflection was even more dramatic. It is found that all the gangs bought a total of 1,895 packages, and the market price of 20-count double horse yarn fell by 8 yuan, the double earth fell by 10 yuan, the Te Jincheng fell by 10 yuan, and the 10-count coarse yarn also fell by 34 yuan. Today, 71 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 87 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and there were still 75 pieces. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows.</p>
<p>Colleagues 1,285 Hong Kong 155 Mainland 35</p>
<p>Yunnan 130 Shantou 110 Total 1,895</p>
<p>The market price of Japanese yarn has been declining frequently yesterday, which is the reaction of the rise in the past. The number of people in the market has been greatly reduced compared to before, and the momentum is cold. However, the selling price is declining day by day, because there is no need for all parties, and some people say that cotton weaving factories have sold out, because the price of yarn is good, and the profit of weaving into cloth is not as thick as raw goods. In this situation, spot yarn cannot stand. The 20-count Yueqin yarn has been in a slump in the front and back markets, and the closing price is 363 yuan, which is 12 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Although the Foreign Market Is High, Brazilian Cotton Still Has Transactions</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is quite active. The government's loan cotton loan release problem has not been confirmed for the spot on the market. However, the previous saying of export subsidies caused all parties to purchase, so the spot on the market is decreasing day by day. Recently, the transaction of colleagues is very prosperous, and the short sellers have also made up a large number of them. As a result, the closing price rose by 6 to 10 pounds. India quickly predicted that it would fall by 1 rupee, (but according to the latest news, the Indian market price rose by 2 rupees today,) Egypt stopped the market, and the exchange rate did not change much. The legal currency was converted, and the US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 5 cents per burden, the Egyptian cotton rose by 5 cents, and the Indian cotton fell by more than 8 cents.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transaction, because the overseas cotton market has been rising for days, the transaction of each factory has temporarily stopped. However, the Japanese side is still buying fiercely in the market. Yesterday, Brazilian cotton still had transactions, and they were all ordered by commercial companies, and they were all delivered in June, and the exchange was about 85 yuan per group. There will be two rounds of shipments from the US to Shanghai this week, with a total of more than 16,000 packages. The following is a list of the spot price of the cotton market that was converted and sent to the factory yesterday.</p>
<p>The local cotton business is still very depressed, and the selling price is not much different from the previous day. The factory's needs are very slow, and it probably only uses the goods that arrive. Therefore, the purchase of local cotton is as rare as a phoenix feather. In fact, the factories that lack goods, even if they have the intention to do so, have no way to start. Therefore, they are hesitant to move forward. The source of northern Jiangsu has arrived in Tongzhou for more than 300 packages in two days. The following is a record of the current cotton situation.</p>
<h3>The Price of Yarn Rises and Falls Greatly</h3>
<p>It is an inevitable result of human creation.</p>
<p>In recent days, the market price of the current market has been turbulent, with storms and rains. The reasons are as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The market price of the current yarn before the spring rose was hovering between 38, 9 and 10 yuan. At this time, South China and Guangxi received commissions, and there were 5,000 packages of 20-count double horse Tiannv brand in all directions. There were still 2,000 packages, which were followed by merchants, with a total of 7,000 packages. The price of handling goods was probably the most at 38, 9 and 10 yuan. It was decided that outside of 400 yuan, the yarn market would be more solid, and the market would be prosperous.</p>
<p>(2) The actual position of the yarn market, speculators suddenly came to activity. At the same time, the "Japanese puppet" Huaxing Bank was established, and there were various rumors in the market. Therefore, buyers fueled the flames and scrambled to buy, as long as they bought in, they created a peak of 450 yuan. Unexpectedly, the degree of rise was too violent, and the actual sales were helpless. The chips were overflowing, and the falling wind was strong. Yesterday, the price had broken the 20 yuan mark, which was 415 yuan, which was a huge difference of 35 yuan from the high price on Monday last week. In fact, the rise in the past was all due to the strong sales, and most of the recent rise was caused by human beings. Therefore, once the cracks appeared, it was like a river going down the drain. The fundamental problem is still the amount of consumption, which is the standard for the rise and fall of the market price. If we rely solely on human power to do it, it will be difficult to last. (Shan)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - The Falling Wind of Dongyi Is Turning Fierce - The Sales of National Cloth to Customers Are Clear and Dull</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>The market situation is tired, and the actual sales to customers have not improved. People's hearts have turned to the lower reaches. The rise in wind before the week was too violent, causing the public to hoard, and it was in stark contrast to the rise in wind due to the supply exceeding demand during the peak sales period. At this time, the actual sales are becoming more and more clear and dull, and the selling price of retail investors is unusually loose and bad. However, the number of pieces is very fragmented, and the attitude of general hoarders is calm, so the return wind of the cloth market is not fierce. The selling price of fine cloth, fine twill, and group cloth has fallen by 5 cents to 12 cents per piece, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth has also fallen by 12 cents. The sales of fine cloth and fine twill in the Ben Street, Jiangbei Gang, and Xiang Gang were more than 50 pieces, and more than 60 pieces of coarse cloth. The retail and disassembled white cloth bag transactions in the Ben Street Jiangzhe Guerrilla Area were endless, with more than 3,300 pieces arriving yesterday. The National Army-controlled areas in northern Jiangsu, Taizhou, and Xinghua also handled nearly 1,000 pieces, with light-colored cloth, poplin, ramie yarn, colored cloth, and printed cloth as the majority. The new additions of the Chuan, Dian, and Guangdong gangs were consistent and scarce, and the orders were still being shipped vigorously. Although the navigation to Wenzhou and Dinghai in eastern Zhejiang has resumed, there are still many obstacles to selling goods, so the loading of goods is extremely small, which is a trial operation.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth</p>
<p>After the white goods rebounded at the end of last week, the sales of colored cloth in the market declined yesterday, and retail investors scrambled to sell, and the falling wind turned tight. At the morning market, the spot price of Longtou fine cloth was 13 yuan and 9 cents, and the wood and moon futures opened at 14 yuan and 2 cents and a half, and then fell to 14 yuan and 1 cent. The spot price also once reached 13 yuan and 8 cents, which was 23 cents lower than last week per piece. Baobei fine twill also fell by 3 cents, opening at 12 yuan, 5 and a half cents to 6 cents. The industry did not open the goods, and the Ben Street turnover was 5600 pieces. The big hoarders still tried their best to raise the goods.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 9th, the export of piece goods was 78 pieces to Fuzhou, 15 pieces to Shantou, and 25 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea - Yokohama Silk Sets New High Price Again</h3>
<p>Shanghai Silk Factory Has Difficulty Collecting Cocoons, Which Is Also One of the Reasons for Following the Rise.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York market was closed on Sunday, and the price of Yokohama silk set a new record high again. The spot price was 1,290 yuan, up 15 yuan, and the forward price was 1,155 yuan, up 19 yuan. The market atmosphere was stable. General speculation is that it will rise above 1,300 yuan. The spring silkworms are about to come up, and the output in Japan will not be abundant. In addition, the currency inflation in their country is increasing, so the conditions for the rise in silk prices are more complete.</p>
<p>The silk market in this port was very prosperous yesterday, but the US sales were relatively quiet, so the French silk market became the focus. Yesterday, the price of 2022 threads of the Bai Factory without Iwinas was 1,770 yuan. Da Feng Cheng Chang and other banks purchased nearly 100 loads in total. The silk price from the British bank was also high, and the grade of Bai Factory Qixing was 1,880 yuan, which can be called an unprecedented market price. There were only Zhili transactions at the New York bank, and six banks sold it for 1,000 yuan, which was another 20 yuan increase. The silk factories in this port have not yet found a proper way to buy spring cocoons. Recently, the cocoon factories in the occupied areas have been destroyed by guerrillas, and 40 cocoon factories have been burned in Hai Ning alone, so as not to be used by others. However, the guerrilla areas have not yet found a possible way to collect cocoons. It is inevitable that it will be difficult to carry legal currency to the inland to collect cocoons and pass through the closure money. It makes the general manufacturers hesitate to move forward. Therefore, the price of silk in this port has been rising day by day, which is not only due to the overseas increase and the relationship between the reserves.</p>
<h3>Huzhou New Tea Is Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the interruption of traffic, there has been no new tea from Zhejiang Province to the port. It is known that a large amount of new tea has been transferred from Hangzhou Station to the port yesterday. Among them, except for 34 packages of De Changxiang, which have begun to be baked, the rest are also preparing to be unloaded. It is heard that the new goods are handled by Sian Shangbei in Huzhou. The mountain price is high, and the shipping cost to Shanghai is worth more than 130 yuan per load. In addition, the cost of work is huge. After the sample is made in three or five days, the foreign firm will have a formal new market. The mountain prices in various places, except for Shangyu and Wenzhou, have been reported in the previous report. It is heard that the mountain price of Tangxi tea is more than 110 yuan. In short, this year's mountain prices have broken the peak record of previous years.</p>
<p>Tea Hua came from Hong Kong on the 8th with 800 pieces, and 28 boxes were shipped to Hong Kong on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Coarse White Returns to Good by Four Corners - More Than 10,000 Pieces of Sugar Are Imported</h3>
<p>According to the London telegram of the previous day, the coarse white has slightly returned to good, and the Hong Kong telegram package fee has also risen to the Shanghai office, and the handling price has also risen by four corners to 20 yuan and 2 corners. Therefore, after the Shanghai market suddenly rose and fell, it has turned better again. The association's drawing plate, the spot price of 24 coarse white goods in the current warehouse rose by four corners, drawing 28 yuan and 3 corners, the price of goods in the foreign warehouse rose by three corners and a half, which was 28 yuan and 1 corner, and the price of goods in the customs warehouse rose by five corners, and 600 packages were traded at 20 yuan and 1 corner. Those that will arrive on the 13th on the road are 23 yuan and 3 corners, and 800 packages were traded. The Taikoo Che Bai rose by one corner, the B-mark west warehouse goods were 28 yuan and 2 corners, the east warehouse was 28 yuan, and the Dutch red and local cotton white remained unchanged. Guotang has a Chao gang that opened 60 packages of ordinary cotton red, 16 yuan and 3 corners, and 670 packages of Huanggang Qing, opened 15 yuan and 3 corners, and the high goods called 15 yuan and a half, but failed to become. The arrivals came from Beihai with 510 packages, Xiamen with 3,850 packages, Shantou with 4,610 packages, Xinghua with 480 packages, and Fuzhou with 3,330 packages.</p>

<h3>Vegetarianism</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to achieve something must have the following positive conditions: spirit first, material second, and form third. This is almost an iron law. If China wants to resist Japan and build the country, the main conditions are no exception. The recently launched spiritual mobilization can be said to be a probing step in the resistance against Japan and the construction of the country.</p>
<p>Today is the longest and most important National Humiliation Memorial Day in China. In the past years, in a corner of Shanghai, there were flag-lowering and other commemorative actions. The situation is special this year. People from all walks of life in China have agreed not to lower the flag on this day, nor to hold any gatherings, but to be vegetarian for a day to show mourning. This is indeed a good way.</p>
<p>Lowering the flag is a form, and form can also represent spirit, and it is sometimes very necessary. However, when this form cannot be held, when weighing the advantages and disadvantages, naturally it is better to abandon the form and focus on the spirit. As long as there is such a clean victory, bearing the burden of humiliation and vowing to avenge the country, even if there are some flaws in form or even material, it doesn't matter. What's more, in addition to lowering the flag, there are other commemorative methods, vegetarianism.</p>
<p>In Chinese customs, vegetarianism is a sign of piety and grief. It is very appropriate to be vegetarian to mark shame with a painful heart; it is especially appropriate to be vegetarian to cleanse shame with a pious heart. Vegetarianism is also equivalent to sleeping on firewood and tasting courage. The Chinese people, especially those in Shanghai, who does not remember this shame? Then, everyone should be vegetarian. This is equivalent to the form of lowering the flag, but it also contains the essence of tenacious struggle, and it can also contribute to the required materials. Why not be vegetarian?</p>
<p>Germany wanted to cleanse the shame of the Treaty of Versailles, and its people did not eat white-mixed beef, tightened their belts, and saved money to build planes and cannons. This is equivalent to long-term vegetarianism. If the Chinese people can be vegetarian on this day, and donate the money saved to the country, the amount must be considerable, and it will help the strength of the resistance, it will not be small!</p>
<p>In fact, on this day, the Chinese people should even fast, let alone be vegetarian. Because if everyone still does not know how to be ashamed and work hard, the result of national subjugation is certain; if the country is subjugated and people are not forced to be unable to eat, or have nothing to eat, they will inevitably be like the Jews. On the anniversary of the kingdom's subjugation, they will always fast for a day automatically. If there is a spirit of fasting now and persevering to the end, I believe that even being vegetarian will become unnecessary in the future.</p>
<p>Those who mourn will surely win, and vegetarianism is also to express mourning. Those who have a belief in victory should be happy to be vegetarian!</p>
<h3>Surpassing the Preceding Generation</h3>
<p>— Ding Ti</p>
<p>We accept the next task, inheriting it from the preceding generation.</p>
<p>Human history is a tapestry woven with the blood of struggle, with the martyrdom of heroes and the foul corruption of demons. It is like the battle of dragons and snakes, locked in combat for millions of years, with light and darkness taking each other's place. There is no eternal light, nor is there perpetual darkness.</p>
<p>Righteous people sacrifice themselves in struggle, seizing light from the hands of "evil." When the spark of light is snatched away by the "wicked," the universe transforms into a hell—deep, dark, and bitterly cold. There is no sun, no moon, no stars, no fire. The timid are frozen like autumn insects, groaning, weeping, lamenting, and quietly dying in despair. The brave, the steadfast, the enlightened, unable to submit to fate, rise up, baring their arms, willing to consign their flesh and blood to the mountain streams; in this way, they build a bridge, so that their descendants can cross the deep ravines, traverse the dark valleys, and climb to the mountaintops.</p>
<p>With the spark of light in hand, the "evil" world falls to the brave, the steadfast, the enlightened, the seekers of light.</p>
<p>Like hibernating insects, hiding in silence, "evil" never disappears completely. Given the opportunity, it will seize the chance to rise up from the soil, from beneath the roots of trees. Thus, "evil," though seemingly dead, will be reborn. In human history, the struggle between dragons and snakes is emphasized once more.</p>
<p>Because the root of "evil" is never completely severed, "righteousness" can never be at peace. Light ascends into the sky, but darkness quietly creeps upon the earth; "morality" barely wearies before the clown tries to strangle it to death; the small boat of "justice" sailing on the vast ocean is constantly threatened by cruel crocodiles seeking to devour it.</p>
<p>"Evil" never repents. Those who indulge "evil" are often harmed by it before long. At this time, those who assist the wicked in their cruelty, the accomplices of evil, the flatterers, are unwilling to praise decaying righteousness any longer. They call it: cowardice, incompetence, the way of natural selection.</p>
<p>When "evil" is ascendant, we are easily infected and attacked, so we want to build a fortress of righteousness to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, we have felt that the fortress left by our ancestors is half-destroyed and half-unstable. "Evil" may invade at any time. Although we may temporarily repel it, it is not eliminated. For lasting peace, we build a new fortress, greater and stronger.</p>
<p>We erect high wooden frames, tie long ropes, and use heavy stones, striking them down with force. We strike, strike, driving piles—driving piles. For the sake of righteousness, thousands of years ago and thousands of years from now, we lay a foundation that is deep, thick, broad, and eternally unshakable.</p>
<p>Sweat drips from our foreheads, our hands and feet are calloused. This is truly a bitter task. Our predecessors would not do it, our friends have not done it, but we, in these difficult times, shoulder it with iron-like shoulders.</p>
<p>"If it's just for self-defense, then it's enough to repel 'evil.' Why build a greater, stronger fortress?" Some mock us for being too busy, for not knowing how to take shortcuts. But we don't care about these things. We are willing to sacrifice ourselves for lasting righteousness. Protecting ourselves, even more so protecting our friends; planning for ourselves, even more so for our descendants.</p>
<p>Not only must we lay a deeper foundation, but we must also engage "evil" in close combat, clearing away the defeated insects, extinguishing the dying embers. For the sake of the universe, for thousands of years to come, we filter it into a clear pool of water, removing the eternal sediment.</p>
<p>Although our predecessors also had a fortress, and they also drove out "evil," now the fortress is about to collapse, and "evil" has not been eliminated. Those who have passed have passed, taking with them laughter, tears, sunny days and cloudy days, sorrow and happiness, leaving behind the fragrance of *Du Ruo*, and also leaving behind the stench of *Peng Hao*. The walls of "righteousness" are erected, but the snakes of "evil" are stirring again, swaying, swaying. Don't you see that the giant boars and long snakes are constantly eyeing us, wanting to swallow the light in one gulp? Tell me, can we continue to be complacent?</p>
<p>This is not a time for complacency, nor is it a time to retreat. Even a single spark can start a prairie fire. Where "evil" is buried, mankind can never be at peace.</p>
<p>Unearth what is buried there; capture and destroy the "evil" beneath the ground; build a deep and strong fortress. For the sake of other evil people, and for the sake of yourself.</p>
<p>Cleanse the universe of thousands and thousands of years, leaving not a single trace of "evil." The dead and putrid, cleanse them from the tombs of the "past," the remnants of the evil legacy, we tear off the masks of "today."</p>
<p>When chasing and attacking, we are the vanguard; when building a fortress, we are the first to raise high the pile-driving stone.</p>
<p>Sow the seeds of "righteousness," and one day they will blossom, blessing the people of the world. Let us build a fortress of happiness.</p>
<p>Since "evil" was not eliminated in the preceding generation, our work must surpass that of the preceding generation, so that it will never be reborn.</p>

<h3>Mourning Wu Mei</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Quan'an passed away in southern Yunnan two or three months ago. There have been several articles in various newspapers commemorating him. More than ten days ago, the National Government issued an order to commend him and grant a special pension. For an old professor, reaching this stage can be said to be posthumous honor. Some of my friends who know that I had some dealings with him have said, why haven't I said a word about his passing? Moreover, I have never seen an article mourning him in *Ziyoutan* either?</p>
<p>Indeed, I spent five years at the World Book Company compiling "The Complete Collection of Song Lyrics," totaling more than 260 types, which had already been typeset and was just waiting to be printed. In addition, I compiled "An Integrated Collection of Discussions on *Qu*," which collected more than 30 types of *Qu* discussions, all of which had been proofread, and I asked him to write a preface for me, which he was kind enough to praise. Unexpectedly, with the sound of gunfire on August 13th, I and my colleagues at the bookstore hurriedly left Yangshupu. Many manuscripts could not be taken away. These five years of my hard work and the bookstore's capital resulted in two massive works, which had to be left at the main factory on Dalian Xiao Road; of course, the preface he wrote for "An Integrated Collection of Discussions on *Qu*," like the preface Mr. Xia Chengtao wrote for "The Complete Collection of Song Lyrics," is now nowhere to be found. Because of this, in addition to generally mourning him as the academic world losing another great master of *Qu* studies, I especially want to mourn him. It's just that I have been busy and restless, and I have been delaying it, not realizing it. This makes me regret it. Now, I have finally completed a set of Northern *Qu* tunes to mourn him. I know it is like showing off one's axe in front of Lu Ban, not worthy of high regard, but since I have a sincere heart, and he once recognized me as a fellow enthusiast of *Qu*, perhaps he will respond.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's given name was Mei, his courtesy name was Jun'an; later he changed it to Quan'an, with the sobriquets Linggu and Shuangyai. He was from Suzhou. In recent years, he served as a professor at Central University. His works include "The Legend of Fengdong," "The Legend of Xuehuafei," "The Legend of Xiangzhen Pavilion," "Random Talks on Appreciating *Qu*," "Simplified Notation of Southern and Northern Nine Palaces," "Quye in the Shemota Room," and "Selected Excellent *Jia Qu* Songs," etc. After August 13th, he first took refuge in Mutian Town in the countryside of Suzhou, at the home of my friend Gu Yongru. Later, when Central University reopened in Sichuan, he traveled to Sichuan with the school, and then followed the school to Yunnan, until his death, at the age of fifty-seven. A detailed biography will certainly be written by someone. Here, I will only briefly mention these things as references for the eulogy below.</p>
<p>(Zhong Lü Fen Die Er) The tragic news is spread, looking south to Yunnan, where the light is no longer seen. The banished immortal returns to the distant heavens. The willows are gentle, the spring is silent, the sorrow is difficult to dispel. The flute's melody is melancholic, how can the falling plum blossoms bear to be blown everywhere?</p>
<p>(Zui Chun Feng) His character is like plum blossoms, refined; his temperament is like cranes, distant. He always entrusted his traces to Shuangyai. Now, he is nowhere to be seen. Seen, the fog obscures the mountains in front. Where the cuckoos cry, fallen flowers form a carpet.</p>
<p>(Ying Xian Ke) The Qunyu Palace, the small pearl boat, the selected *Qu* tunes, the vast collection of *Qu*. Fengdong's heroism, Xiangzhen's collection, how many surviving works, all suffer from the war.</p>
<p>(Hong Xiu Xie) Spring is like a thread under the Stone City. Peach and plum blossoms bloom, the skirts and shoes dance lightly. The leader of the literary circle year after year. Unexpectedly, the bloody wind blows the sea, and the torrential rain submerges the mulberry fields. Only the swaying curtain is left, drifting everywhere.</p>
<p>(Shi Er Yue) Searching for the gate, in front of Changchun Lane. Resting the staff and shoes along the Mutian Creek. Mourning Qu Yuan at the foot of Linglong Mountain, visiting Xi Shi near the Liguo border. In the blink of an eye, everything becomes a past event, leaving only lingering echoes.</p>
<p>(Yao Min Ge) Ah, listening endlessly to the sound of the Yangtze River's ten thousand miles of waves. Seeing endlessly the towering Shu Road, like the blue sky. Early again, a load of luggage to Sichuan. Opening the mat again, sitting on the green felt. It's a pity, just when Du Huanhua was leaving the Gorge, it turned out to be Fu Xian's wish to ride a crane.</p>
<p>(Yao Hai Er) All because the Shu River boils and the Shu Mountains tremble. And flowing to southern Yunnan. Spring sorrow is dark, unable to sleep. Thoughts are always grievances. Knowing that the rebirth of the nation will eventually be fulfilled. Helplessly, growing old, wandering, only pitying oneself. Difficult to dispel, clouds vast, the soul fading at Chicken Foot Mountain, water vast, dreams broken at Erhai Lake.</p>
<p>(Wei Sheng) Mourning the war dead, thoughts are confused. Writing new lyrics, the sentences are not beautiful. Hoping for the day when the Royal Army pacifies the rivers and mountains in the north. Awaiting to sprinkle wine and offer a chicken at the grave.</p>

<h3>Wusong Road Project</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from the fifth month of the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign)</p>
<p>North of Yangshupu, directly to Wusong Town, Western merchants are building a road, winding for dozens of miles, forty feet wide, using people's fields, with compensation given. In the early stages of this project, when building a bridge at a road intersection, villagers repeatedly pulled out the piles. After the Consul-General sent a letter to the Shen Official, who instructed Chen Sima to investigate and explain, the situation was complicated by the clamoring of women. Later, Chen Sima gathered the headmen of various districts and repeatedly persuaded them to give a large price for the use of private land. The project was divided into sections, and local villagers in each area were assigned to build the road on their own land, with labor costs still paid. For the first section of the project, silver was paid in accordance with regulations, and construction was carried out. The villagers gladly engaged in the work. The latter part of the project had already crossed into the territory of Baoshan County. The Austrian Deputy Minister, Xia Gong, distinguished between the roads and the remote areas, and gave silver ranging from 270 to 300 taels per mu. Where there were actual obstacles to buildings, demolition fees were added. Local headmen and property owners were gathered together, and it was ensured that everything was voluntary, with agreements signed before construction began. For those who had been surveyed and measured, silver was immediately given, without any coercion or duress for dozens or hundreds of households. The remaining areas connected to Baoyi and the areas directly north that had not yet been determined were to be first marked with gray, forming a road pattern, so that the headmen of each district could then investigate and build accordingly. The number of fields under the names of individual households to be used could also be given the land price first. The current honorable magistrate of Baoshan, Zhang Gong, has been instructed by the official to come to Shanghai to negotiate and jointly go to the countryside for surveying and measurement.</p>
<h3>Swire Company Acquires Ships</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Gongzheng Steamship Company held a meeting yesterday and decided to sell all of its ships to the Swire Shipping Company. It is scheduled that the company will be established as a trading house after March next year. It is also heard that Swire will use two new ships for the Yangtze River, which will also arrive in March next year.</p>

<h3>Saying a Few Words to "An Apprentice" and Others Suffering from the Same Ailment</h3>
<p>— (Chi Qiang)</p>
<p>Recently, an "apprentice" expressed the hope that society would establish correspondence schools, allowing him or them to read a little during their spare time. This urgent desire for knowledge has moved me greatly. As the editor of this publication said:</p>
<p>"—I think the issue of establishing correspondence schools is secondary. The Shanghai East Public Association sending fifty investigators to various district shops to investigate the educational level of apprentices and to implore managers or shopkeepers to allow their apprentices to study is indeed an urgent matter!"</p>
<p>If accomplished, this will be good news for "an apprentice" or most apprentices. They will send people to implore your managers or shopkeepers. In the future, your desire for knowledge may overcome the difficulties in this "imploring." As long as the shopkeepers and managers "allow" it, your long-cherished wishes can be fulfilled immediately.</p>
<p>This is a completely true matter: shop assistants, apprentices, or middle-aged people who have lost the opportunity to study, residing in the cultural center of Shanghai, constantly exposed to knowledge, there is not one who does not urgently think of the importance of seeking knowledge. They think that way, but at the same time, the clutches of life tightly grip their surroundings. Therefore, wanting the brain to absorb a little spiritual food is still not as difficult as enduring hunger. The famine of knowledge, at most, is like suffering from anemia or a chronic disease. Being able to endure it, becoming muddle-headed, joining the ranks of the illiterate, will not lead to loss of life! But if bread is lost, "death will occur in seven days"! Ancient teachings are clear and worthy of fear! This is the first point that ordinary apprentices have not dealt with clearly under the torrent of both spiritual and material food!</p>
<p>Secondly, during the apprenticeship, under the accumulation of habits, there seems to be a situation of "selling oneself into servitude." There is only the shop, not the apprentice; there is only the freedom of the shop or factory, not the apprentice's freedom: there is only the freedom of the shop owner or manager to plan and accelerate production, not the apprentice's freedom to cultivate their own body and mind. Therefore, life and death are determined by fate, and rolling away is destined. They will be "beasts of burden" for the rest of their lives! This is another point in the complex structure that prevents apprentices from achieving their desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>We can frankly say that, in the eyes of the shop or factory, apprentices seem to be a flexible tool for generating wealth; and ordinary managers and shop owners mostly embrace the ambition of "the Qin Shi Huang's policy of keeping the people ignorant." The moment an apprentice looks at a book, the machine stops there "like a white horse passing through a crack": the unified economy must naturally temporarily declare a disconnection, and the production function cannot be allowed to waver! Not only that, but proximity to ink stains one black. Once the mind is opened, the apprentice's desire advances greatly: either demanding improved treatment, or jointly starting an independent business, the production elements are destroyed midway. If another batch is recruited, not only is it considered greatly contradictory in business terms, but it is also felt to be a waste of capital, which is really too uneconomical. This is another point why apprentices want to study but shop owners and managers are unwilling to boldly let them try, leading to their inability to seek knowledge.</p>
<p>With these three relationships, the apprentice's schooling naturally has to implore their shop owner or manager to allow it, so those who think it is urgent, the urgency lies with the shop owner or manager, the key lies in their answering or not answering only.</p>
<p>Now, I wish the apprentices of Shanghai, to wait quietly and not be impatient, let educational institutions such as the Shanghai East Public Association send personnel to investigate, and to help you implore or find ways. Even the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Education Office is based on this original intention of rescuing unemployed workers and shop assistants, and has established four vocational night schools within the concession, and also often helps unemployed apprentices to implore their factory directors, shop owners, and managers. Presumably, there are many wise and understanding factory owners, who often respond to requests and gladly comply. However, sometimes the factory adds a little "snack money" to the apprentices' pockets and implements its intensified work to seek a special surge in production, then the snowstorm of leave requests flies, and it is time for the apprentices to "steal busy during leisure." So I think the apprentice's bread and spiritual food are both important. Abandoning spiritual food and focusing solely on bread can easily lead to becoming muddle-headed, unknowingly, and sticking to one's original position in the career; as for abandoning bread and pursuing spiritual food, the west wind is ultimately not enough to satisfy hunger! To be an apprentice, one can only plan for both, and obtain both kinds of food through imploring and negotiation or permission. The national economy and people's livelihood rely on this. I wonder if apprentices find these words pleasing to their ears?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts on Reading History</h3>
<p>— Lin Gengbai</p>
<p>Since the border defense autumn is urgent, the Jianghuai area sees days of disorder. The dragon war begins in the Nine Provinces, the crabs of a single surname grow fat. Empty cities are moved and resettled, the refugees are graded in status. The army labors and mouths are wearied, the long siege covers ten thousand miles. At night, I sigh over the affairs of the marshal, the pure officials compete to steal hooks. I hear nothing of punishing the two eunuchs, only of pardoning all the provinces. The blood of the generous Tian Heng, the sorrowful head of Ma Ji. The front army is still fighting, while the staff hides Qiao Zhou! The party's enemies are in the same boat, the flattering to the stove abounds. Eyes pierce through waiting for the Uyghur horses, tears are exhausted by the camels in Luoyang. The dust of the servant Yuangui, the halberd of the general Yueshi. The spirit of the radiant Gao Guang is here, eternally protecting the Han mountains and rivers! Hundreds of generations speak Xianbei language, three capitals wear Jimo boots. Riding in carriages like cranes, arrayed in ranks like geese in vain. The Jiangzuo are reveling Wang Xie, Shanxi relies on Mu Po. Even now, the Yan Zhao bandits dare not cross the Yellow River! The Beifu soldiers are still strong, the western neighbors have exhausted their envoys. Still able to rely on Jin Zheng, unable to rely on ghosts and Rong. Pacifying internally laments Chao Cuo, greedily taking credit is a mistake like that of Lü Meng. Lingering over the historical regrets, is it only selling Lulong? The Ba Shu region once revived the Han, Jingxiang did not preserve Wu. From ancient times the relationship of lip and teeth, one must cut into the diagram of the heart and stomach. The Yin is lost and Qin can recover, the ball is lost and Chu is also isolated. The army is exhausted Zhang raises the red banner, tearing the eyes to see the Donghu! I do not see the Master Zhu, I bear the trace of Bailu in vain. Officials receive half a *Shu*, hermits enjoy thousands of *Zhong*. The world is without Confucius, who can ask Duke Lu. Tomorrow on the vast sea, the world is turbulent! (Charity donation)</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Ninth Episode: Enduring Grief and Suffering, Tears are Shed in All Directions</p>
<p>This kind of tear-jerking drama is truly as Jin Danyun said: Why write this kind of tragedy, to make people feel sad? However, because humans are the most emotional animals, the more tragic and moving the drama, the more people want to watch it. Many things in dramas, knowing that they are castles in the air, there is no such thing, just writers creating them from imagination, from the pen. However, seeing the tragedy of life and death separations, the heroic and tragic sacrifices, even a clever person will shed tears. People say: when reading books, one worries for the ancients, now when watching dramas, one truly grieves for the people in the play. For example, Jin Danyun said: Why this kind of tragedy, but telling her not to watch it, she will definitely not want to. There are even those who laugh at themselves, why do they have to cry, it is truly inexplicable. Moreover, today this Miss Lin, performed really well, her tears, I don't know where they came from, naturally and truly tears flowed non-stop. Because they were true tears, the people watching the play accompanied her tears, truly like the ancient poem says: "The Red Chamber's tears are angrier than the tide." This play finished, it was already twelve o'clock, Wu Junsu then invited Zhu Airen, Jin Danyun, He Shuangyu, Li Wang to her room. According to Junsu's meaning, it was rare that they all came, tomorrow is a Sunday, she wanted them to stay here for one day. Helplessly, Zhu Airen was eager to accompany the He sisters to Zishan Village, taking advantage of that Sunday being a rest day, after this day, she would be busy with work again. Airen also briefly told Junsu about the He sisters going to survey the land to build a silk weaving factory, and she was also very happy. Thinking that the He sisters, since they are starting a business here, they can often gather together. As for Jin Danyun on the other hand, she was also eagerly wanting to return to Shanghai. Because Mrs. Sulia, no matter how big or small, wanted to ask Miss Jin. Miss Jin was not only her senior advisor, but simply her secretary. According to Mrs. Sulia's intentions, it would be best to ask Jin Danyun to resign from the post of entertaining foreign guests under the National Diplomacy Committee, and be hired exclusively by her. But Jin Danyun refused to agree. She was willing to serve the public, to do her part for the country, but was unwilling to work for Mrs. Sulia personally. Although in terms of remuneration, Mrs. Sulia's side, the treatment would be several times better than her current position. But Jin Danyun kept the heart of serving the country, and the National Diplomacy Committee was unwilling to let Miss Jin resign. And Mrs. Sulia gifted Miss Jin a lot of property, she also declined them all, she said: she has enough to use, she doesn't need extra wealth. (105)</p>
<p>Life Report</p>
<h3>Apprentices in Retail Stores</h3>
<p>— Zhi Bai</p>
<p>In the Spring and Autumn column a few days ago, I saw a letter from an apprentice to the editor, in which he expressed his hope of being able to attend compulsory school in the evenings. This request is indeed good, but in reality, it may still be impossible – especially in retail stores. Moreover, how can one expect it under the hands of bosses who only care about making profits and not the future of their apprentices? The author is also a small clerk, so he can very well understand the daily life of ordinary apprentices. Therefore, he writes this out, hoping that the bosses will allow apprentices the opportunity to study, so as not to bury their aspirations. In ordinary retail shops, they open at seven or eight o'clock in the morning. However, general cigarette and paper shops and candy stores open particularly early in order to meet the needs of the morning market. For example, cigarette and paper shops have many people coming to buy breakfast dishes and cigarettes as soon as it dawns. At the same time, the chief cooks and maids from the vegetable markets also come to exchange money in order to buy the food they need. Candy stores cater to office workers and students going to school, who come to buy bread, butter, milk, etc., so they must open early as well. Moreover, the people who deliver bread from the factories are particularly early, so apprentices have to get up especially early to open the store door, sweep the floor, wipe the tables and chairs, and tidy up the goods – which is also what they should do.</p>
<p>The other stores originally used this time as their morning practice for calligraphy, but in cigarette and paper shops and candy stores, business is naturally more important due to the busyness. Moreover, some lazy female bosses sometimes even ask them to buy groceries and cook. In the afternoon, it is even the busiest time in the market, and they are simply busy like this until eleven or twelve o'clock at night. Especially in the summer candy stores, they still have to deliver goods at night, because there are particularly many people buying soda and beer in the evening, so apprentices have even less opportunity for self-study! Alas! What exactly do they learn? At the same time, the bosses are also not understanding and are unwilling to hire an extra experienced clerk. They would rather pay less and have the apprentices take on this extra work. Therefore, apprentices can only forever groan under the oppression of selfish managers and bosses!</p>
<p>Although the author's life is better than that of apprentices now, the time for self-study is already after ten o'clock in the evening when I am exhausted, and I still have to endure many setbacks. Therefore, I implore all capitalists not to hinder the future of apprentices for their own selfish interests, and to at least come up with a way to give them time for self-study or night school.</p>
<h3>An Opinion on Hanging Flags</h3>
<p>— Mou</p>
<p>Some time ago, there was a misunderstanding about hanging the national flag. After negotiations between the municipal chamber of commerce, the Chinese ratepayers' association, and the authorities of the two concessions, it was agreed that flags would be hung on eight designated days each year, and the issue was resolved. The day before yesterday (May 5th) was the anniversary of the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President and the establishment of the revolutionary government, and it was also the first anniversary of flag hanging after the establishment of the above-mentioned informal agreement. Going out early in the morning, one could see the national flag flying everywhere, solemn and beautiful. On the one hand, this demonstrated the citizens' patriotic enthusiasm, and on the other hand, it greatly inspired people.</p>
<p>It should be known that the national flag represents the country. We respect the country, and therefore we also respect the national flag. We cherish the country, and therefore we also cherish the national flag. We raise it very respectfully in the morning, and we should lower it very respectfully in the evening and store it properly. However, on the evening of the 5th, around 8:30, I went shopping and saw that many stores were still flying the national flag. Perhaps they were bearing the immense sorrow and indignation of being forced to take down the flag in the past, and wanted to fly it to their heart's content on days when they could hang it. However, out of respect for the national flag, we should take it down in the evening. In light of this, I specially borrow a corner of your esteemed publication to point out this error, hoping that all merchants in the city will pay attention to it. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>
<h3>Unfree Marriage</h3>
<p>— (Buddha)</p>
<p>The marriage system for young people nowadays is free; there is no need for the orders of parents or the words of a matchmaker. However, old-fashioned families are an exception.</p>
<p>Now there is a certain young man who sees a certain modern woman and is pleased with her. They are deeply in love and always together. But when the woman wants to make a lifelong pledge and enter into marriage, the young man refuses, saying that as long as the old man next door is around, this agreement cannot be made. Listeners will definitely be surprised by this strange tale.</p>
<p>There have been cases of young people committing suicide because their marriage was interfered with by their parents and they could not achieve their goals. I have never heard of someone being afraid that the old man next door would interfere and therefore not daring to make an agreement. Mr. Zhang Shi is the first to have this happen.</p>

<p>Hoping Mei Wan Hua will Call for Revival</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Kunqu opera is the essence of Chinese drama. It has elegant lyrics, melodious music, and delicate expressions. When Mei Lanfang performed "The Assassin of the Tiger" in the United States, it was quite successful, and those who perform Peking opera are also better if they have a Kunqu opera background! Thus, Kunqu opera should be very prosperous. However, the reality is not so. For example, the Xiani Society, which is the only surviving group, performed at the Dongfang Shuchang last year and at the Xianyao Theater recently, and the business was very bleak. The acting skills are no less than those of first-class Peking opera stars, and the ticket prices are very low, but the audience is never crowded. Compared with Shanghai Opera, Shaoxing Opera, and Changzhou Opera, it can be said that there is a world of difference. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Most people always say that Kunqu opera is "too highbrow" and "the words are too profound." This is certainly true, but I think this is not the main reason. For example, can the audience understand Peking opera? Probably not. I can sing a few lines, but honestly, apart from familiar plays, I'm just watching the performance. Moreover, in terms of dialogue, most of the dialogue in Kunqu opera is in Suzhou dialect. People in the Suzhou and Shanghai area should understand it more easily than Peking dialect. Why can't it attract attention? I think the following points are worthy of study.</p>
<p>Lack of Scenery</p>
<p>Watching a play is inseparable from watching the scenery. Facing beautiful and pleasing scenery is certainly more comfortable than facing a plain yellow board. I remember once going to see Zhou Xinfang's "The Magnificent缘," in which there was a Kunqu opera segment. The stage was decorated with extremely beautiful scenery, and the lights in the whole theater were dimmed, radiating beautiful arc lights. White snowflakes fell from above, and Wang Xichun, draped in a vermilion cloak, sang a Kunqu opera duet with Zhou Xinfang to the melodious sound of the flute. The whole theater was silent, and there was endless praise after the performance. If "The Peony Pavilion" had such a good scenery, I am afraid the effect would be the same.</p>
<p>Lack of Costumes</p>
<p>Costumes are quite important to ordinary people, let alone performing. If Mei Lanfang was asked to perform in a torn dress, it probably wouldn't be very good.</p>
<p>Lack of Publicity</p>
<p>Publicity is an indispensable thing. May I ask if anything in society can be a sensation without publicity? Which Peking opera stars were not made famous in Shanghai? The Xiani Society lacks publicity and support.</p>
<p>Lack of Comparison</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "You don't know the goods until you compare them." If you don't compare things, you won't see the difference. If the theater troupe 程剧团 has no other opera troupes to compare with, and they perform in Shanghai for five cents a year, people will probably think it is "commonplace and nothing to be surprised at." Now there is only one Xiani Society like this, and no matter how well they sing, there is no way to compare.</p>
<p>The above points of shortcomings, the way to save it, all lies in the economy. The members of the Xiani Society are all from poor backgrounds, and even their livelihood is a problem, let alone other things. As for re-establishing a Peking opera training class like those of the past, and teaching more new disciples, who would be willing to do this work? In the beginning, Mr. Mu Ouchu spent tens of thousands of dollars. It was not easy to train the current members of the Xiani Society, but now, those with the power to do so easily find it "incumbent" to do the complex work of Kunqu opera. In my opinion, only Mei Lanfang Mei can do it. He is now the king of Chinese drama. Shouldn't he promote the essence of Chinese drama? Is it not his duty to Zhang Chuanfang's skills, why can't he配断桥 for Wanhua? If we can get Wanhua to call for revival, then Kunqu opera will be revived one day.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Suixiu, a member of the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society, has a beautiful appearance, steady stage presence, and a clear voice. She is a talented female amateur.</p>
<h3>Watching the Abridged Version of "Tears on the Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Victor</p>
<p>Lan Lan is much better than before, and all the sisters of the women's world are present</p>
<p>Adding the word "abridged" to "Tears on the Flowers" seems very ridiculous, but in fact, the Shanghai Drama Society is indeed performing an "abridged" version. Originally, "Tears on the Flowers" had five acts that could not be performed, and only the fourth act was performed. This Sunday morning, the Shanghai Drama Society performed at the XinGuang Experimental Theatre, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. In such a short two and a half hours, even performing four acts is impossible. Therefore, the Drama Society came up with an "abridged" performance: cutting off the beginning and end, and only leaving the middle section, cutting off the first act and only performing the middle second and third acts. Now let me talk a little about the performance.</p>
<p>This time, in these two acts, we found many corrections. Taking the actors alone, Lan Lan's Lai Lai is much better than in the past. When he recites poetry, his voice is also raised, and his eyes are on the poem; when listening to the truth, the earphones are also tightly attached to his ears, and his movements are much calmer. Especially in the third act, when she is preparing to sing La Salle's suicide, she uses many small movements to show Mimi's confused and painful mental state before her suicide, which is very good.</p>
<p>For example, the lights gradually dim, and the soft music rises. Mimi pours out all the cosmetics and lipsticks wrapped in her hand, and with a dazed and sad mood, stands in front of the mirror, looking at her still young and quite beautiful face and figure... Isn't it very lovely? When she first prepares to sing La Salle, a large handful of colored paper pieces from the Guidance Society suddenly falls outside, startling Mimi and causing her to ask loudly who it is? Isn't this much cuter than before? When she stands at the window and sheds tears sadly (this action is not done well enough), she takes the curtain and wipes her tears, and then (her face is gloomy) stretches out her hand from the window and slowly walks to the table to take the poured La Salle cup... Isn't this terrifying mood and atmosphere enough? In the past, Hong Mo played Chang Haicai, the comprador of the Dalai Bank, but Shuyan played it instead. His movements are more varied than Hong Mo's, but he has one shortcoming, which is that his shoulders and body shrug too much.</p>
<p>Mona's Mimi's mother is still a pleasing character, and the audience still likes her vulgar temper and laughs loudly, but the atmosphere of civilized drama is still strong.</p>
<p>Xia Xia, Zhang Wanjun, Xu Li, Tu Guang, and Ding Zhi all maintain their past achievements. There are two pieces of music inserted before and after the two acts, which adds a lot to the atmosphere of the play.</p>
<p>On the day of the performance, the dancers who are preparing to perform, such as Yang Wenying, Wei Chuyun, and Fang Lili, are all present. It is said that their play will not be performed until next month.</p>
<h3>Yifeng Drama Society Holds Registration</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The Yifeng Drama Society, led by the famous actor Zhou Xinfang, has been well-received since it performed at the Carlton Grand Theater and has won the trust of the audience, who consider it the only progressive and perfect troupe in Shanghai. Now, in order to make the organization more consolidated and sound, the company is preparing to register with the government, opening up a precedent for Peking opera troupes. Xinfang recently told people that Yifeng Society's performance is in a stage of 青黄不接, so the script must be both new and old, so as not to go against the evolution of the times and cater to the tastes of the audience. Only at the appropriate time can a comprehensive reform be carried out, so as to avoid the danger of wanting to achieve success too quickly. Xinfang's arduous management can be seen in this one aspect. Those who care about the future destiny of Peking opera should support and supervise it.</p>
<h3>Photo of Liu Qinxin's "Little Shepherd Boy"</h3>
<p>— Xing Yan</p>
<p>In recent days, there has been a great flourishing of talents in 花衫. Among male actors, there are only a few such as Xiao Cuihua, Mao Shilai, and Xiao Guihua. Among female actors, there are not many in the north, and only Yu Sulian in Shanghai has been working hard to study recently. In addition, there is also a Liu Qinxin, a disciple of Liu Yuqin, who has a good foundation in 花旦戏 and whose skills in 蹻工 are steady, which is especially commendable. Green 花旦戏 mostly wear袄裤, and it is not enough to display the graceful posture and the beauty of a graceful figure without 蹂跷. For example, in the play "Little Shepherd Boy," there are many poses that are not easy to look good without踩跷. In their later years, famous Dan actors often vigorously advocated the abolition of this because they were not good at 蹻工. This is inevitably giving rise to ridicule that one would cut one's feet to fit the shoes.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Recording the Brutal Acts of Warlords Massacring Actors</p>
<p>The previous narration of the reasons for the rise in the value of actors is mostly due to the enthusiastic support of warlords and politicians before the Northern Expedition; but among them, there were also a few military men who hated the actors the most. One was Meng Enyuan, who had been the military governor of Jilin, and the other was Chu Yupu, who had been the military governor of Zhili. Meng once buried alive the Qinqiang opera star Yuan Yuanhong (named Wei Lian, not the old Yuan Yuanhong Guo Binchen). Chu once shot the male 生 San Kui, Liu Hanchen (not the Wusheng Liu Hanchen who is currently performing at the Tianchan Stage. This Liu Hanchen, whose original name was Eight Years Old Red. The deceased Liu Hanchen performed at the Nine Mu Di New Stage in his childhood, singing and learning from Pan Yueqiao, and it is said that he was Pan's adopted son, and Liu Wenkui was a brother of Liu Wenmei). The origin of these two incidents was all due to adultery and had a great relationship with their concubines. Meng was born from a 捞毛 (meaning pimp), so when it was his birthday one year, someone sent him a brocade, but when he opened it, it was a large teapot made of coarse porcelain, and on it was written the six characters "Large Teapot Meng Enyuan." At that time, there were many guests present, which really made him angry. It is said that his concubine was also born as a prostitute, and later fell in love with Yuan Yuanhong. Meng learned of this and captured Yuan Yuanhong and buried him alive. Who was the one who found the other to start their love affair? Because it was far away in the northeast and more than twenty years have passed, the people of society have not been able to find out the truth. As for the matter of Chu Yupu shooting the two actors Liu and Gao, it has only been a dozen years, and this matter is also close to Tianjin, where both Chinese and foreigners are concerned. Although Chu has passed away, the heroine who seduced Liu and Gao is still alive in the world. Therefore, I have long learned in detail the whole story of this incident, and now I will describe it in detail, first to speak out for the wronged actors, and second to expose the cruelty and killing of ordinary military men in the era of warlords, who insisted on their own way. It is just as the saying goes, "Loving someone, you want them to live; hating someone, you want them to die." They also supported the actors and killed them. This kind of nonsense behavior is incomparable to the patriotic generals led by Chiang Kai-shek today, who are loyal to the party and the country and defend the country with their hot blood. They have all received advanced training and only know to put national affairs first. Their virtuousness and unworthiness cannot be measured. 六)</p>
