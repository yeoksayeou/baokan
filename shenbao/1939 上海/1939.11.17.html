<h3>日本對華之經濟戰</h3>
<p>自日本侵華兩年餘，勞師於外，動衆於內，徬徨於和戰之歧路，今且以北海登陸聞矣。北海者，合浦縣南之一海口也；淸光緒二年開爲商埠，其先凡桂省與雲貴之出產，以是爲出納口，及梧州南髯蒙自先後開埠，頓失其商業上之重要性。今日軍突由北海登陸，無非欲截斷桂越間之公路，並作進攻南甯（今稱邕甯）之企圖！據日海軍省人所宣稱；「目的在加緊華南海岸之封鎖，北海攻陷之後，則所有中國海口，均將入於日本手中」云云，可見其意之所在，殆於軍事之外，偏重於經濟性質也。蓋南甯爲西江流域貨物之集散地，素有「廣西倉庫」之目，淸光緒三十二年自闢爲商埠，商務之盛，與梧州相頡頑；海運之貨，大都取道於北海，今則有公路以通安南之同登諒山。但日人即使占據北海港口，北進以窺南甯，固難得逞，即欲切斷桂越公路，其最短之距離，尙有一百四十公里，亦非準備犧牲大部之人力物力殊無希望之可有。惟可注意者，日人之欲結束對華戰事，宛如急色之兒，大有迫不及待之勢。今則於軍事之外，政治經濟。雙管齊下。政治姑不論。其於經濟方面。在地方未占領之先，破壞惟恐不甩其極，故飛機之轟炸，往往擇不設防之城市。摧毀工商業之巨區、及其旣占領之後。囊括又惟恐其不周，故凡農工商礦航運之所有，藉「統制」之名，行「獨占」其實。明知蛇吞巨象，終難消化，然非至欲吐不能，彼似有所不顧也。</p>
<p>日人之對華經濟作戰也，此兩年中，想亦自以爲着着進取，躊躇滿志矣。其在金融上之作進攻也，華北則發行「聯銀」鈔票。思奪取法幣之地位。旣難得逞。又轉以華北之鈔票。套取上海之外滙。亦無成就。旋思染指於華中，而所謂「華興」，鈔票，尙難得志於淪陷區；乃轉而移其兇燄於關稅，以爲可推行無阻矣；孰意徒增算盤上之工作，實際仍以法幣相授受，但爲變相之增稅而已。又欲封鎖天津英租界，攘奪中國之存銀，雖英人有意與日人求妥協，其無如信誓旦旦，有言在先，豈輕易變更其遠東政策，不問物主之同意與准許，而擅自處分其資產，此重契的之英人所不願爲也。至日人對工商業之進攻也，一面壟斷中國之物產，强奪中國人之產業，名曰合作，無殊共產，商人蓄怨積怒而未發。又進而破壞第三國人經商之利益，非得有日方「運輸許可證，」不得裝運貨物至滬，而若干口岸，並「許可證」而亦不允發，如雞蛋即其一例。蓋日人之所欽，淪陷區內之事業物產，俱爲日人之所有，所經營，藉便其搜刮之能事。即和局有告成之日，亦將藉口於「旣成事實，」久假而不歸，此所以不顧一切而多所攘奪也。一面復將日貨傾銷於淪陷區域，利用奸商，冒充國貨，行銷內地，類是者亦甚多。據重慶方面所發表，今年八個月中，爲日本所吸收之中國物產，計達四三五，六四〇，〇〇〇元，同時日貨輸入中國淪陷區者達二二六，二〇八，〇〇〇元。又從海關方面統計本年第一·二·三季洋貨進口爲一，〇六一，七三一，五六四元，日貨占其二四五，五三〇，〇〇〇元，較之去年同期竟增一一六，三三四，〇〇〇元，足見日貨在淪陷區內傾銷之劇烈；爲日人計，宜可稱慶矣。而無如因對華軍事之不了，坐失歐戰發展貿易之機會，緣是而不易獲得海外原料，吸集外滙，以拯救其軍事體制日漸强化工商業之厄運，則其在華之所得，或有不償其所失者在矣。</p>
<p>此外則封鎖中國軍隊管理下之各海口，溫州海面之封鎖，時張時弛，內河沿海航運之把持，日益加甚。原日人之心理，尙恐統制不密，綱漏呑舟之魚；而不知日人所可統制者中國貨物也。所不可得而統制者中國之民心也。况夫武力戰爭，本爲經濟侵略之後援或前鋒。武力戰爭而固勝利在望也，則經濟本爲囊中物，置之緩圖可也；若武力戰爭之勝敗，尙在不可知之數，則對於戰區資源之掠奪，尙惟恐席捲之不盡，豈肯稍緩須臾。於以見經濟戰略之緊弛，可窺測戰事之成敗；則如近日北海日軍之登陸，焉知合浦珠還，仍非爲短時期之事耶！</p>

<p>現紗晨開、同業相聚談論、傳聞日軍在北海登岸、恐有影響紗市、大家束手觀望、旋以搶帽子之流、首先甩出十包、二十支雙馬現貨價爲六百四十二元、跌六元、少頃同業某號心思看好、復來收進幾百包、回升二三元、中途聞外匯趨鬆、實需不暢、市態始終不離徘徊之境、査半日間成交八百九十包、上日午後成交二百〇五包、行情三十支雙馬跌三元、雙地球跌四元、天女跌五元、但收盤以後續見軟弱、再疲二元、今日出口棉紗有三百十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　七一〇　香港　一八〇</p>
<p>上日成交　二〇五</p>
<p>兩日合計一、〇九五</p>
<h3>紗銷鬆懈　棉市日非</h3>
<p>本棉交易、轉趨减色、但同業稍有成交、　子亦較缺乏、不及昔日之熱閙、實緣紗市鬆懈、廠方意態渙散、於是消費不暢、兼之美棉同落、而美匯放長尤厲、所以情况亦硬中帶平矣、至於日廠、近來紗市下墜、更無採辦之舉、蘇北來源到通花三千九百五十八包、北沙來三百七十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>通花　一三四·〇〇　一三四·五〇　一三五·〇〇　同業進　三八二包</p>
<p>火機　一二六·〇〇　一二五·〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>通花　一三五·二五　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>常陰沙　一二九·〇〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續靜寂異常、匯兌又趨鬆動、紗銷殊呈呆滯之狀、廠方購意頗爲淡薄、同業對於長織維之美棉、購意始終不衰、日來對於此項棉價、異常注意也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、連漲已有旬日、昨日開盤之初、仍形活躍之狀、同業交易甚夥、因而略漲二三磅音、後因南方帮在市乘此漲風盛熾之時、又起套賣、一部份多頭、亦乘機獲利了結、因之收盤價格較疲、較之上日跌落近十磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比、埃及停市已有二日、昨日價格漲起近四十磅音左右、利物浦漲二三便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　蘆羊尖堅俏</h3>
<p>新粳窰種跟好　客秈午後回小　洋米已有成交</p>
<p>粳尖　米市自前午一度回跌後、昨初開因隔昨餘勢、人心尙懈、一般貨主亦鮮有出樣、故早市現象仍覺徘徊、詎至中市本鄉作客乘廉搜進、市面爲之帶緊、一般作客羣相競購、內地帮暢辦次尖、市面一律喊高半元許、來源續到車輪包子三千四五百包、而囤戶未會出手、結果全市成交雖旺、數逾萬包、但各貨價僅增二三角而已、新粳及窰菉種因隔昨削透而提高二三角、獨蘆羊尖因到貨寥寥、棧存薄弱、兼之品質較客尖優勝、處於粳米副品、店家胃口殊番、故脚地堅固、價續提一二角至三四角不等、收盤行情特蘆尖爲二十九元三角、中至二十八元七八角、特羊尖二十八元七角至二十八元、次貨二十七元七八角、已與普通粳價相仿、至陳新變元、悉屬挺秀也、</p>
<p>客秈　晨市被粳尖湧到影響、市乃一度回落三四角、旋有投機吸收、且傳日商所辦蕪米或須外運、不克儘量來滬、其在月前拋出者、勢將不能如期交貨、故在市收回拋出棧單、因此人心興奮、價乃陡漲近元、比之前日仍較大五六角、然至午後聞洋米有成交、市面與人心又復下趨矣、全日開出三千六百包高蕪秈價至二十八元半云、</p>
<p>洋米　連日醞釀之洋米交易、其中一批昨已正式成交，計一號西貢二千四百噸、每包價三十元零六角、定十二月八日起裝、上海浦東或浮筒交貨、經售者爲達孚洋行、而購進者均係零星分配、尙有合義洋行等十批、價三十一元、浦西棧房交貨者、迄未妥交云、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油猛漲</h3>
<p>比上月份漲十二元零　竟有欲抬至八十元者</p>
<p>豆油市况、自一部份被把持以來、又値來源稀少、在兩重壓迫之下、近兩日漲風可畏、行市比較上月同日之最高價、暴騰十二元有奇、如此瘋狂壟斷、不知何故、昨市桶油比上日價再漲三元、簍油二元五六角、但買方祇有小數獲利斬結、所以成交數不多、因一般執貨者、尙看八十元行情耳、昨　做開大連油十桶（價詳市價欄）、靑島油五十桶、膠州油四百件、烟歧油五十件、路貨二十件、青歧油一百件、路貨二十件、及本廠油一百担、花生油完全由豆油帶起二三元、銷塲出口不動、本街團胃問津膠州油二百五十件、靑島桶油五十桶、及江北桶油三十桶、</p>
<h3>南北貨　白蓮回振</h3>
<p>蘭谿白蓮前以甬甌均有轉到、爲數較多、曾一再轉跌、售盤不上一百七十元、茲據產區函訊、辦價突升二十餘元、而此間北帮復起採購、價乃隨升、昨市價盤已呌一百八十五元至一百九十元矣、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白港電轉漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電、粗白爲一一·六五、香港太車白B嘜、漲港幣〇·八五、爲一七·〇五、惟本市公會劃盤以實銷少動、續見挫落、現貨二四粗白本棧五十一元、外棧老貨五十元至五十元半、新貨五十一元至五十一元半、轉口四十一元、太古車白東棧B嘜五十五元三角、西棧老貨五十五元半、西棧新貨五十六、餘照退、H嘜車亦四十元、荷赤四十一元半半、本一號白五十一元、二三四號照一號冰六十二元、二號六十一元半、晶明冰六十三元、國糖有建帮開出刁青一百四十包、言明即出、價為三十三元五角、今日出口糖有二千包運往天津、</p>

<h3>夫婦生活在初冬的衛生法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培性病專科醫師詹念曾　合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日預洽</p>
<p>世間眞不知有多少夫婦，因不知衛生而陷入悲慘的地獄中！一個精强力足的丈夫，在性生活方面常處於主動地位，這是事實。妻子雖希望丈夫時時陪伴在她的身邊，但每不喜歡常常那個。可是常她熱情的高浪時，又滿望丈夫健壯雄偉而有耐力，俾在愛的協調中度他們幸福的生活，這也是造物者在獎勵男子健康的增進，若因荒淫縱慾而致失健者，男子應完全自負其責任。荒淫縱慾與自凟遺精，最易耗竭生殖腺液，生殖腺液是我們的生命源泉，所以凡精枯力竭的男子，什九必息神經衰弱，發育不全，早洩陽痿，未老先衰，腦弱腎虧等症。同時更因身虧慾旺之故，在此漫漫長夜的冬天，又最易引起衝動，挑動其妻的熱情，而每呈曇花一現，不能予以滿足。這怎能不引起妻的憎恨呢？由憎恨而感情破裂，演出私奔離婚，憂傷自殺等家庭悲劇者亦多不勝計！</p>
<p>冬不藏精，春必病瘟，這是每個男子都應該知道的常識。初冬天氣「小陽春」，黃花正好蟹正肥，誠可及時行樂，但切不可濫。夫婦雙方除非都懷着熱情，有舒暢一下神經的必要，惟亦須早點兒入睡，事後尤應有充分的休息。總之用愛情來培植健康則可，若有損健康，決非相宜。萬一因早年浪漫已有上述症象，更須及早作澈底治療。治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法製成，有效成份得完全保存。所以此劑品質貴重，功效確實而迅速，爲任何類似製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間卽可生精補腎，健腦活血，尤貴連服不斷，則更助長發育，滋養神經，短期內必可根治各症。服用一冬，增加體重，健康日進，中老年人常服，延年益壽，返老還童。惟患遺精症者，須兼服世界馳名治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，製止遺洩，必收效尤速！</p>
<p>患者沈季卿君，杭縣人，在某銀行任職，因早婚斷傷，患遺精早洩症，並不時健忘失眠，致夫婦間感情冰炭，職業亦有難能勝任之苦！上月至本診所診治，經察知其確實病狀後，卽囑其在永安公司西藥部購男用「生殖素」二打，「希米脫氏固精片」（每匣實價兩元）五匣使其兼服，並施以電療注射等法，爲時一月有半，頃已百病霍然，精强力足，不特辦事增加了效力，夫婦間愛情亦勝猶新婚矣！</p>

<h3>乳峯萎癟的影响與補救方法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>在時代進展，科學萬能的今日，不惟從前人們認爲毫無辦法而抱恨終身的缺陷—麻子，塌鼻，吊眼，缺唇等等，都可憑着精良的器械，與嫻熟的手術，可以改造成爲正常的形狀。卽一向被人忽略而關係比麻子，塌鼻，吊眼，缺唇尤爲重要的女子的一對乳峯，現在也有一種專劑可以使它高高地聳起。蓋麻子，塌鼻，吊眼等在外表上固然覺得難看，但他與健康尙無甚麽關係，而女子的乳峯如果萎癟了。則女性最寳貴而可愛的曲線美，即無從形成。同時與健康方面，更屬關係重大。因爲女子的乳峯能够高聳，全仗卵巢機能活潑健全，如卵巢機能因月經病，白帶症，營養不良，多產虧弱等症所摧殘，則乳峯必無良好之發育。卽本有良好之發育者，亦必漸漸萎癟下去，甚至平坦得一如男子。此等女性，固不必想在交際塲中出人頭地，卽在普通的家庭里，老實說：（一）難免不爲丈夫厭惡，引起狎遊娶小的不幸。（二生育維艱，更難免伯道無後之嘆！（一）健美喪失，多病多痛。（四）因子嗣之無出，雖有百萬家產，亦祇好拱手讓人。凡此所云。俱爲一般人所共見共聞的事實，不是作者讕言。</p>
<p>至於作者所說的補救辦法，那祇要女性們有堅强的信心，向藥房指購女用「生殖素」，按日服用三次，每次三片。約服四星期，食慾必然增進，精神爽適，肌肉亦漸豐潤。繼續服四五星期，頭腦淸新，血液充旺，乳峯自亦漸漸隆起。此時功效固已極度明顯，但此劑藥性和平，毫無副作用，應再繼續賡服，担保面色紅潤，肌肉滑潤，靑春長駐。</p>
<h3>遺精的病理和療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>由童年而進至成年的階段中，生殖機能卽逐漸成熟，這是靑年人前途和幸福的啓示！若不知自愛，或眛於好奇與惡劣環境的引誘，犯有自凟與同性戀愛，或早婚與縱慾，摧殘了性神經，使精關鬆弛後，必爆發着遺精症，所以凡患遺精者，什九必有神經衰弱症。在此初冬，天氣未寒，而彼已手寒脚冷，精神萎靡。若遺精日久不治，則精關日益鬆弛，遺洩的次數亦逐漸增加，很多靑年因輕症的夢遺失治而釀成可怕的滑精漏精症。精液是我人生命的源泉，如此繼續多量遺失。勢必至精枯血枯，百病叢生，則凡腦力衰弱，記憶不良，頭目昏眩，亂夢失眠，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全等症卽不一而足。此種靑年大都面黃肌瘦，或外强中乾，精力萎頓。如在求學時代之學生，學業必落人後，在工商界從事職業者，必感難能勝任之苦！同時因爲體貌不揚，每爲異性所棄，陷於失戀慘境，即婚後的夫婦生活亦難諧魚水之歡，家庭間恒演出種種悲劇！或更未老先衰，早年殤亡！</p>
<p>遺精症失治後的悲慘是盡人皆知的。所以及早治療最爲上策。治療之法，惟有速服治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」，以鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，當夜卽可收安眠止遺之特效。如因遺精縱慾而已有上述症象者，須兼服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，連服不斷，則更助長發育，調整新陳代謝機能，短期內必可根治各症。服用一冬，可使體重增加，益壽延年。患者如能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>日本在華作戰　已陷於窘迫境地　對蘇美兩國惟百般屈服　結束戰事意嚮仍感徬徨　须磨之重要谈片</h3>
<p>日外務省情報部新任部長須磨彌吉郞到滬後、於前日下午在百老匯大厦、舉行特別新聞報道會議、招待外籍記者、答復所提出之各項問題、須磨首稱、「余離遠東已久、此次來中國、乃所以見聞「東亞新秩序」者、繼答記者之詢稱、「關於如何解決中日戰事之意念、當以蘇日兩國分劃中國勢力圈一說爲最可笑」、記者詢、「然則以何者爲最佳」、答一常以實行日本前首相近衛文膺一九三八年十二月廿二日聲明之意旨爲最佳」、</p>
<p>蘇日懸案　亟待解決</p>
<p>詢「日本將盡何等能力、以改善蘇日關係、而構成兩國互不侵犯條約之訂立、」答、「尙無一定之步驟、故蘇日訂立條約、亦無先決之條件、」及日蘇關係、須磨謂「兩國間現有若干懸案、以待解決、東京方面、以爲當逐步解決各問題、最後遂得調整兩國之關係」、記者詢、目下蘇日談判、對於蘇聯援助中國問題、是否爲要點之一、」答、「談判中懸案之主要者、爲漁權問題·邊境問題等等、該項問題之討論、政治之糾紛、並不滲入日本政府意念之中」記者詢、「多方面均以爲蘇聯政府與第三國際係二而一者、今日本是否能一面發動反共運動、而同時父能與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約歟、須磨之覆語、避免正面作答、謂「余並未謂日本將與蘇聯訂立互不侵犯條約、日本所抱之政策、亦未有改變、</p>
<p>中日戰事　如何結束</p>
<p>須磨雖謂解決中日　爭最佳之法、莫如實現近衛之聲明、然未能確言日軍最終有自華撤退之決心、而謂「此須視將來之發展及環境而定」、關於「新中央政府」事、須磨謂「並無確切之報吿、因正式成立之期、尙未有所定、雖然東京方面曾有日期之消息傳出、不過基於各個人之觀點而已、延遲成立之原因、爲事務籌備之不及、或以爲不易建立及遭有某種阻礙而成僵局、則非也、日本政府現仍繼續進行其旣定之政策、以求達到目的、」記者詢、「閣下發言、日軍之最終撤出中國、有待將來之發展、則汪精衛不能向中國民衆保證其能達到使日軍撤退矣、然乎、」須磨語塞、僅謂、「日本之政策、惟基於近衛之聲明、至注氏如何、或其他方面如何、在所不問、且亦非日官員之所宜述也、」記者詢、「在氏於本年十一月十二日聲稱、將求中國之絕對的自由與獨立、如無辦法、則惟有奮鬥到底、閣下之意見如何、」須磨對此詢問、考慮之下、決定不作答覆、乃謂、「余目下不欲討論任何中國方面之聲明、連同汪氏之聲稱在內、惟須麼對於「東京是否願與國民政府直接交涉、或經由第三國之調停」一問、則答語肯定、曰、「絲毫無此意思、」記者詢「日本是吾以支持在精衛爲限、」須磨答、「日本之支持、並不以某惆人爲限、面視其「政權」之主張、凡主張之合乎日不者、皆得廣博之支持、」</p>
<p>日本疲憊　對美屈服</p>
<p>繼乃討論及美日關係問題、須磨稱、「余方自美國回來、故自覺對美國所知頗多、余覺美國朝野上下、均未曾希望美日關係之惡化、故余信美日關係必能增進、余歸國而後、此種期望、更爲增高、因見日本政府及日本人民、均熱烈希望求得美國之諒解也、雖然、美國對日本抗議之五百九十四案、仍懸而未决、惟日本當力求美國之滿意而解决之、惟日本對華用兵、所費力量、已達極大之角度、在此狀况之下、復欲求解决對美懸案、自當費時耳、不過日本之努力與善意、當有一日可見也、」記者詢、「明年正月前、美日之新商的有完成之可能否、」須磨表示承認日本政府正渴望新商約之訂立、又謂、「假使美國不願與日本簽訂新商約、則受影響者、不止爲日本、美國亦將感受不便、美人當信之也、」記者詢、「所謂『東亞新秩序、』豈能使美國感覺與其政府不牴觸乎、」答、「美國之報章與雜誌、對此表示種種不同之意見、惟美國政府及人民未必皆爲反對『新秩序』之死硬派也、」美政府旣已明言對世界之進展、並不盲視、而方今全球、包括東亞在內、均在動亂之中、則余信美國當不欲仍與局勢之進展背道而馳、以停留於盲視階段也、</p>

<h3>進犯丹陽日軍　遭全部殲滅　丹陽西南新四軍奮戰　斃日軍二百七十餘名　日承認長江下游華軍活躍</h3>
<p>爲策應華軍湘北大捷後之抗戰新形勢、密集日軍後方京滬路一帶之新四軍及江南抗日義勇軍、不斷施行逆襲側擊之運動戰術、以致日軍在淪陷區中之活動範圍、日益縮小、感受莫大之困苦、茲據丹陽來客談、本月八日晨、日軍一百餘人、自寳堰（丹陽南二十七里）進犯延陵鎭、（在丹陽西南四十里）、携帶輕軍武器、聲勢甚盛、</p>
<p>戰鬥劇烈日終被圍</p>
<p>新四軍一團×營及二團王團長據探報後、即親率×營，嚴密佈置將部隊集結於延陵以西之九里鎭及馬家村、形成强固之包圍綫、當即與日軍發生劇烈之戰鬥、槍砲聲震數十里、新四軍因得人民之援助、諜報之正確、及地形之熟悉與有利、四週公路交通之破壞、使日軍不得源源增援、更加以作戰經驗之豐富、（該軍經過大小戰鬥三百决以上）抗戰認識之淸楚、勇氣百倍、無不以一當十、奮力衝鋒、日軍雖恃武器精銳、終被殲滅大半、</p>
<p>一晝夜間日軍全滅</p>
<p>旋有丹陽及白兎鎭兩處日軍二百餘人、開來增援、新四軍二團×營亦趕到、遂展開二年來江南罕見之激戰、戰鬥開始自八日晨、直至九日上午、共歷二十八小時、結果遂將日軍全部殲滅、計擊斃二百七十餘名、傷數十名、繳獲輕重機槍六挺、擲彈筒三個、步槍一百六十餘枝、俘日軍三名、其他軍用品無算、該軍在此次戰鬥中、亦英勇犧牲五六十人、傷四五十人、此次戰鬥、堪稱爲該軍在江南戰塲之赫赫戰功、</p>
<p>藤田承認華軍活躍</p>
<p>昨據日方消息、最近新任上海方面陸軍指揮官藤田中將、十五日向外人記者團發表談話、承認華軍活躍、使「治安」無法確立、藤田略謂長江下游方面、實爲華中政治·經濟·軍事最重要之地、其「治安」之確立、係最急要務、惟現時尙存有華正規軍及游擊部隊、時時出擊、擾亂「治安」、故日軍擬先舉全力」肅淸此等軍隊、而圖「治安」之確立云云、但華人方面深信日方此種企圖、終屬心勞日拙、</p>

<h3>偽警槍擊英人汽車　外僑深表憤懣　英領將向偽市府提抗議　開槍之偽警號碼亦查明</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英總領署對於某英人昨夜駕汽車經地豐路大西路口、據稱因漠視「値交通崗」之「特別市府」警察所發信號，致被開槍一響射擊事、將向「市長傳筱庵提出抗議、、本市外僑對此槍擊案、頗爲憤懣蓋大批持械大道警察旣在界外馬路區租界馬路與人行道上圖奪公共租界警務處之活動、今駕車至該區、乃感覺不安全也、</p>
<p>英人姓名　暫不宣佈</p>
<p>該英人姓名、未經宣佈、渠於昨夜駕車循地豐路而行、在衣黑色冬季制服之大道警察一名旁駛過、迨車過交又處、聞槍聲一響、槍彈飛過車旁、該英人乃加速駛走、開槍者似係立人行道上而非「値交通崗」之大道警察、嗣有人問該警何故開槍、據答稱、「因車中人見警務信號、不　車之故」、</p>
<p>英軍當局　要求解釋</p>
<p>大陸報云、某英人昨（十五日）夜駕汽車自地豐路駛入麥琪路時、大的因未見「特別市府」警察指揮交通信號、致遭僞警開槍射擊、該英人姓名、昨晚未經披露、靜安寺捕房未得關於此事之消息、但英軍當局則已通知「特別市府警察總局、要求解釋、</p>
<p>未見信號　突聞槍聲</p>
<p>該英人循地豐路自北駕車南行、至大西路附近、貝一市府」警察一名、乃緩車前駛、但偽警並不作交通信號之手勢、該英人乃驅車續駛、車甫經海格路交又處而入麥琪路時、突聞槍聲一響、彈在車旁吁吁飛過、幸未命中、遂繼續驅車前駛、旋向英軍司令部報吿、</p>
<p>英領抗議　今日提出</p>
<p>昨晚最後消息、英領事館當局爲英僑前晚遭偽警槍擊事、正候工部局捕房之詳細報吿、至遲於今日午後、可向僞市長提出抗識、又悉、英軍當局向僞警局提出之質問、迄至昨晚、尙未得覆、惟英軍巳査悉該開槍僞警之號數、並已通知僞警局、該遇擊之英僑姓名、爲避免發生意外、尙不允發表、惟悉彼爲上海萬國商團團員、</p>
<h3>流浪街頭兒童　設法收容</h3>

<h3>藤田執行外籍記者　顯示內心苦悶　對蘇聯美國均不願開罪　中日戰事何時結束難言</h3>
<p>—內地開放亦口惠而實不至—</p>
<p>字林報云、上海區日軍司令官籐田中將、昨日（十五）午後、在江灣官邸招待外籍新聞記者時聲稱、日本陸軍對付蘇聯、儘可能避免無意義之衝突、俾對世界和平、有所供獻、渠摯望對於解决美日兩國間久懸問題、獲得合理而諒解的接近後、兩國間之關係、將大爲改善、至於撤銷對第三國人民在內地貿易與旅行所施之限制一節、渠未能給予任何確切之保證、准許不受限制而居南市之問題、刻正在日軍當局嚴重硏究中、</p>
<p>內地開放　渺茫無期</p>
<p>籐田答覆各記者事先提出之大批書面問話時、表示其意見稱、歐洲供給重慶之軍器與其他戰具、當然已因歐洲爆發而减少、籐田並向各記者保證稱、在軍事需要之可能範圍內、將逐漸寬弛對外人在內地貿易與旅行所施之限制、惟此種寬弛、須不妨碍軍事行動、渠不能言定何時將實行寬弛、因此點須視日軍之配置與敵軍陣營中之局勢而定也、</p>
<p>對華戰事　前途難測</p>
<p>或問長江游流域與南京近郊游擊隊活動如何廣泛、籐田答稱、佔據此等區域之日軍、迭與游擊隊接觸、但游擊隊今漸失效、於招當時期後、將可恢復和平與秩序、因雙方有戰事、旅客頗多危險、故對此等區域內之旅行與商業所施限制、乃不可避免者、渠不能言定中日戰事將持續多久、日本在華是否續有軍事目的物之問題、全視將來情勢而定、</p>
<p>在華日人　良莠不齊</p>
<p>美日關係、已稍見改善、若雙方諒解的商談懸案、則渠信刻仍存在之差異點、即可解决、而使兩國間關係、得較明朗之氣氛云、籐田於起身前、並與各記者談論與中日兩國有關之種種問題、問到塲之新聞記者、曾居日本者有若干人、然後又問據彼等之意見、日人是否爲非愉快之人民、某記者答、在日之日人誠然如此、但在華之許多日人則不然、籐田聞言大笑稱、不幸在華日人、良莠頗不齊也、</p>
<h3>英東旭萊隊　將調天津</h3>
<p>西福資隊他調之說　英軍當局未能證實</p>

<p>霞飛路一八七七號巨大花園洋房一宅、爲前任江西省長與全國水利總裁現任中國殯儀館董事長、贛人陶家瑤夫人陶華裕芳之財產、陶氏全家前曾住居在內、八一三戰事時、陶氏合家遷住海格路七五三弄六號、迨戰事發生後、此產委由同安公司出租、二十六年十月間、由中央造幣廠向同安公司租賃此屋、作辦公地點、每月租金四百元、當時雙方</p>
<p>訂立租約</p>
<p>但註明最短期間爲三個月、至上年十月間、陶氏將該洋房售與西人喬其（譯音）、一面與中央造幣廠終止租約、着令遷讓、因中央造幣廠拒絕遷讓、致陶氏方面不能依出售契約交屋與喬共、遂由陶氏賠償喬其損失一千五百元、撤銷買賣房屋契約、而陶氏所住之海格路七五三弄六號房屋租賃</p>
<p>合同期滿</p>
<p>房東達理會計師不允繼續租賃、陶氏急需電屋遷移、又令中央造幣廠遷讓收同房屋自住、結果仍因中央造幣廠之反對、乃於本年四月間、由該洋房所有權人陶家瑤之夫人陶華裕芳出面、委任李國珍李遹駿兩律師具狀特二法院民庭、對中央造幣廠負責之法定代理人談嵩濤</p>

<h3>男女青年會　主辦學生服務社　用過的書籍文具都可寄售　售出後抽手續費百分之十</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>在物價上漲，生活程度日艱的今日，一般家境小大好的學生，都知道家長籌措學費的不易，而關於在學校中一切需用的文具，書籍，爲體恤父母起見，也能實行撙節。而同時，上海基督敎男女靑年會，也就看到了這一點，所以最近舉辦一個學生服務社。</p>
<p>學生服務社的社址就在靜安寺路九九九號女靑年會。前天的下午，筆者爲求探知這服務社的情形起見，特地走去作一次訪問。就在女靑年會會所左側的一列平房之中，和家庭用品交易所在一起，僅僅佔了屋子的一角，一張長桌子上，放着幾十本舊書，另外有一個書架，上面放的也盡是些舊書</p>
<p>另外一張小型的寫字檯上，坐着一個職員，埋倒了頭在書寫。我就說明了來意，和他閒談了一會。據說這决男女靑年會所以要舉辦這一個學生服務社，目的就在提倡生活節約，實行撙節物力，交易書籍用品，專爲全市學生服務。至於服務的範圍，包括學生日用書籍，文具，以及一切日常生活用品，祇是不合實用而破爛損壞的物品，是不在服務之例。</p>
<p>各校的同學，如果有用過的，或是已經不合用而沒有損壞的書籍，文具，生活用品之類，可直接交給學生服務社陳列出售。貨價可由貨主自定，不過服務社方面，得有徵求貨主同意而再行估價之權。寄售的東西，一經售出，服務社到月底就出一通知書，由貨主前往領取售得之款，而服務社方面，照貨價提出百分之十作爲手續費，如貨主能多多提成捐助，那是格外歡迎。這筆手續費，除去辦公費之外，悉數捐給上海基督敎男女靑年會救濟會作寫學生救濟經費。</p>
<p>寄售的貨品，時間短長由服務社方面決定。凡是寄售的物品，不能出售，或是寄售的過久，他們會通知貨主，由貨主憑收貨時所出的收據領回。如果貨主仍舊要繼續寄售，那就要重新登記。倘使貨主接到通知以後，過了限期，還是不去把貨物取回，那服務社就有權自由標價拍賣，不過拍賣所得，除了扣去百分之二十作手續費以外，其餘還是歸貨主的</p>
<p>寄售貨物的不限學生，就是廠商方面，有貨物托學生服務社出售的，也很歡迎。不過另有辦法，上面所說的種種，是不適用的。目前學生服務社創辦伊始，正在極力的使社務推廣，並着手徵求各校學生加入合作。可能的話，將來在學衆多的學校裏面，敢可分設售貨處，辦法完全和門市部相同。的確，在物價昂貴聲中，書籍，文具也一再漲價，多數家長却在負不起子女不就學的重擔，而現在男女青年會的舉辦這個服務社，也是需要的中，因爲直接雖是使學生撙節物力，但間接就是减輕家長的負擔。希望全上海的靑年學子，都能加入合作，使學生服務社將來能收到超過預料所獲得的效果。</p>
<h3>我國的飛機製造廠</h3>
<p>— 金記</p>
<p>據一們將飛重慶的某美國專家在香港對華訪員稱：中國西南部某處，現在有一所中國政府自建，內有二千餘技工，資本二百萬的飛機製造廠，此廠完全係中國政府為實行發展航空空計劃的一部分而創設的。</p>
<p>許多華籍勤勞的青年技工們在十五位美國飛機製造專家指導之下，對於廠中工作始終不肯放鬆，埋着頭在苦幹。所建的廠屋為要避免做空襲的目標，全部隱藏在濃密的森林裏，而且有很好的防空設備。在一九三三年，該廠在杭州已粗具輪廓，到了一九三四年，已能自行製造飛機，供給政府。</p>
<p>抗戰爆發，該廠地近戰綫，首遭空襲，但是損失據報　徵，廠方於是開始遷往南京再遷漢口，最後用了一百八十輛的運輸車全部自漢口載到西南；雖然廠中技工及職員等經過幾度的虛驚和因難，他們仍很熱心工作，始毫沒有怨恨的表示。</p>
<p>該廠現址位於鄕間，離開大城市很遠，可是一般的交通還稱便利，如果再需要遷移的話，並不是一件難事。專家又謂：該廠的設備比較現在美國飛機廠的並不見得遜色。我們試估值廠屋全部建築費，約需七十萬元，如要在美國建造同樣的一所飛機廠，至少須費美金二百五十萬元。此外廠中尙有特爲美籍技師設計構造的小型宿舍二十一所，及容八十一具病床的診療室。</p>
<p>因為事關軍機，一時不能宣佈該廠最近有多少出品，不過大體說來，成績一定不錯，這是可料想得到的。該廠附近的人口並不算多，大約祗有三千五進之數，可是所能供給該廠以作材料的物產的產量，却很可觀。在過去八個月中，這位專家會經飛行美國及該地之閒，共有二十七次之多。</p>

<h3>火燭小心</h3>
<p>— 冬耳</p>
<p>「火警！火警！」觸目驚心的大字標題在社會新聞版上登載着，跳樓而成殘疾，或更不幸而葬身火窟者，在每條新聞的末尾又都有着可怕的數字紀錄。冬天本來是最容易引起火災的季節，畏寒早睡，忽略了星星之火；生爐取暖，遭致了燎原之災，尤其是現在人浮於屋的時候，每一所住宅中，不知擁塞着多少人家？一個廂房，分租三戶；半間樓面，隔成二家，於是前後左右，幾乎都是煤球爐子的世界。而作爲劃界的又盡是些破舊的洋松薄板，經過了煤球爐子的長期燻迫，一旦着火，眞是令人不敢想像！</p>
<p>「火燭小！小心！」同時在街頭弄底我們聽見了這樣的呌喊聲</p>
<p>打更，在上海，祇是到月終節邊向每家住戶討取一些洒錢的一種卑賤職業，不過，在夜半更深，每個人都已在溫暖的被窩中做着好夢的時候，他們衝風冒寒，繞着每一條黑暗的弄，摸着每一家的後門，敲着梆子，喊着「火燭小心，」爲了人們生命，財產的安全而服務，我們得感謝他們這種艱苦的工作的。</p>
<p>所以，夜半夢回，聽見「火燭小心」的喊聲的時候，應該檢點一下四週有沒有發生火災的危險，而且，半夜醒來，也是捫心自問的時候，這卜卜的更聲，也正是良心上火災的自省警吿，因爲「孤島」就是個「火燭小心」的地方！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排塲</p>
<p>這個東吳大學校的小旅行社，是中國旅行社派一位職員，駐紥在那裏的。因爲學校有五千多人，不免人事繁賾，所以組織了個信託服務社。其中花樣很多，有小銀行，小商店，小印刷所等等，而也有了一個小旅行社。這小旅行社裏，雖只有一位職員，却也很忙。因爲東吳大學校裏，雖然大一半是江蘇人，可是別省的人也很多。尤其是浙江省人，再其次要數安微省人，連四川廣東兩省人都有。他們每日都有人往來，或是敎職員學生回到他故鄉去的，再不然，便是大批學生們出去旅行。甚而至於小學校的學生，派往歐美留學，也可由這個附屬於學校的旅行社代辦。此外就是像今天星期六，要算是最忙的了。有的要走京滬路回去省親的，有的要從蘇嘉路回到浙東浙西的，更有的離蘇地不遠，趁小汽油船，或是長途汽車不過一兩站路的，都託這個旅行社辦理，而旅行社也都能給你辦得妥妥富當。原來你倘然要旅行到那裏去，有幾個人，目的地在何處，只要一個電話打給旅行社，旅行社便給你預備了票子，或是派人送給你，或是你自己去取。好在這個旅行社，就在宿舍的外面，附設在信託服務社內，只占了一間小房子。你每天到學校裏去的時候，便要經過它門前。旅行社到了相當的時候，便有一個電話，打給火車站，汽車站，或者小汽輪碼頭，吿訴他們賣去了若干票，請留下若干位子，也是很便當的事咧。至於信託服務社裏的那個小銀行，眞是麻雀雖小，五臟俱全。也有儲蓄部，也有匯劃部，也有保管部，也有往來部。有了道一個機關，甚爲便利。最初譬如春秋兩季始業，學牛們繳學費的時候，也是交到這小銀行裏。學生們帶了多餘的錢來，放在身邊不便，也可以儲蓄在這個銀行。又倘然有什麽銀錢上的支付，也可以開一個往來戶，他們給你　本小支票簿，你要付出什麽款項時，塡寫張小支票，人家也很相信你。因爲在那個時候，誰也不肯開空頭支票，只要開了一次空頭支票，就丟失了你一生信用，何况在學校裏的，都是靑年人呀！（二〇三）</p>

<h3>為麒派大會串　獻給難民救濟會</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>九月一日，我曾在本刊撰「建議賑務當局舉行麒派大會串」一文，現在聽說這一個理想將成事實，難民救濟會內定本月廿八日至三十日假座更新舞台，爲難民請命，演唱義務戲三天。末一天將根據我的建議，舉行麒派大會串，不過他們所擬定的一麒派大會串」是麒麟童和他的及門弟子聯合演出，並不是將所有麒派老生包羅無遺。所以戲碼方面，前决我所擬定的勢將不適這决義務戲的應用。現在重行根據他們所內定的演員，代爲擬定戲碼如左：</p>
<p>李如春（介子推）火燒棉山</p>
<p>于宗瑛（馬超）　王富英（張飛）　兩將軍</p>
<p>楊寳童（徐策）　徐策跑城</p>
<p>高百歲（關公）</p>
<p>麒麟童（魏廷）　陳鶴峯（黃忠）　戰長沙</p>
<p>王少樓（高寵）　挑滑車</p>
<p>李如春（項伯）</p>
<p>陳鶴峯（張良）　麒麟童（范增）　高百歲（項羽）　楊賓童（劉邦）　王富英（攀噲）　鴻門宴</p>
<p>上面所擬戲碼裏的演員，完全由麒麟童和他的桃李担任，每人差不多兼演兩齣戲。論戲碼都是個人的拿手傑作，麒麟童的一齣「戰長沙」，現在紅得和「追韓信」一樣，飾魏延更具獨到。此戲必能號召。大軸之「鴻門宴」集麒門弟子於一堂，可謂破天荒之創舉，信芳屢欲一演范增，此次果如所願。「一鴻門宴」一戲，范增佔極重要之地位，其人之個性，頗難描摹，非信芳扮演，不能勝任愉快。鶴峯以演小生戲，最稱拿手，飾張良恰到好處。其他如百歲之項羽，富英之樊噲，素稱絕活，故此戲如此搭配，可謂天衣無縫；設能演出，必可轟動一時也。不過上面的戲碼，只能演廿刻鈍，因爲演員只限於麒鬥中人，所以無法拉長。以愚一得之見，不如邀未列麒門之麒派老生如王椿柏徐鴻培等人，一併參加，則不但陣容益堅，戲碼亦將更加精彩，而時間方面如加一二齣戲可演至六小時以上，實爲一萬全之策」，未審難民救濟會諸公以爲何如？</p>
<h3>鄭孟霞再醮皮鞋商</h3>
<p>— 翠屛</p>
<p>「南腔北調」女藝人鄭孟霞，數年前曾在滬與趙如泉合演京劇，後又曾下海爲舞女，最後在藝華公司主演「新婚大血案」偵探片，鄭天資聰慧，穎悟異常，有特殊進步，且能粉墨登台唱平劇，學平劇二年，即能粉墨登塲；讀英語未二年，能與英人會話；到星嘉坡數月，即一口流利星洲方言，其天才可見一斑。前嫁陳高聰，婚後愛情極篤，陳不幸于去秋病歿杳港，當陳病劇時，鄭日夕侍奉左右，親奉湯藥，典質延醫，而隱不使陳知，但陳卒不起，鄭爲生計所迫，乃下海伴舞，同時現身銀幕，最近則已再嫁港中皮鞋富商，結婚之日，胡蝶曾親往道賀。</p>
<p>鄭之前夫陳高聰爲跳舞名家，數年前上海RCA無綫電公司舉行全滬跳舞比賽（爲該公司新出品收音機作宜傳），凡冠軍一對人物，除獎該公司最新式無綫電收音機一座外，並由該公司出資請到好萊塢游歷，當時因不限參加者之資格，全滬舞女都盡行參加，而逐鹿最力者爲方自美國歸港之北平李麗，與現在星加坡伴舞之梁氏姊妹，結果，冠軍一對人物，竟爲鄭孟霞與陳高聰夫婦獲得，當時鄭孟霞陳高聰夫婦之名，滬上中外各報，均以大字宜揚，而滿懷冠軍雄心之李麗，則屈居亞軍地位，誠一佳話也。</p>

<h3>唐槐秋會見紀</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>唐槐秋到上海來了。到上海的當天晚上，他就到琁宮劇院觀看他女兒若靑的「明末遺恨」。常初發現他的時候，即使我們在卡爾登時期每天見面的老朋友，也幾乎不認識他了。他戴了一副黑眼鏡，唇邊留着濃厚的鬍鬚，分別僅一載，這位「年輕的爸爸」也居然老了。</p>
<p>當天因爲他不願損失這齣轟動全滬的「明末遺恨」，我們握手之餘，的了第二天再談之後，就分手了。</p>
<p>第二天到璇宮後臺，站在我面前的唐槐秋，又恢復了二年前的年輕而健談的樣子。我裝着手勢向他兩撇鬍子的時候，他拉住我的手，彷彿演戲似的在我耳畔輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「我老子還沒有留鬚，做兒子留着這……」他摸着光光的上下脣，「似乎有些不好意思吧？」他雖然裝着私語的樣子，但說話聲音還是很高的，在化裝室里的演員，不由地大家笑了起來。</p>
<p>唐若靑剛在化裝，他回過頭來看了看父親，也對着鏡子笑了起來。一面對我說：</p>
<p>「我倒想起一件事來了，前幾天貴報有條「南國藝壇」，說我興若英和父親背道而馳。其實「中旅」在香港的事變，原因很複雜，表面上外界是不能明瞭的，可是我有一句話可以說的，便是罪名不應全歸在我爸爸身上。這一次妹妹到上海來讀書，我因為離開上海兩年來，也想乘此機會來玩幾大，因之，又引起外界說我與著英和父親背道而馳的話，現在爸爸回來，就是事實的答覆一</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Landing at Qinzhou Bay Unsuccessful; Chinese Defense Works Extensively Deployed; Japanese Attempt to Build Military Airfield at Landing Point; Japanese Troops Near Longmen, Fangcheng, Repelled</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Sources familiar with the current situation here state that whether the Japanese troops advance towards Beihai or attack Nanning, they will be met with strong resistance from the Guangxi and Guangdong armies. The Guangxi and Guangdong armies stationed at the Japanese landing sites along the coast of Qinzhou Bay are elite troops commanded by Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. They are currently engaging the Japanese army within well-prepared defensive fortifications. Simultaneously, the roads in this area have long been destroyed by the Chinese side and turned into mud, effectively hindering the rapid advance of Japanese mechanized units. Furthermore, villages within a ten-mile radius on both sides of the existing roads have also been completely destroyed. These defensive measures by the Chinese side were prepared as early as eighteen months ago. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to cut off Guangxi's external communication lines will ultimately be an empty dream, at best resembling the situations in Xiamen and Shantou. (Sixteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to Japanese reports this morning, the Japanese troops who landed near Beihai continued to advance inland yesterday. The newly landed Japanese troops are constructing a military airfield at the landing point. The Japanese naval air force will use this as a base to provide cover and support during the army's attack on Nanning, Guangxi. Japanese official statements and newspapers have not mentioned the true purpose of the Japanese troops, but the news of this airfield construction has been confirmed by the Naval Ministry. The Japanese official announcement stated that the Chinese army at that location has been defeated and routed by the Japanese army. A statement from the Japanese Army Ministry claimed that the Japanese army encountered no resistance when landing at Beihai, with only one person injured. The climate there is very harsh, with wind and rain. (Sixteenth United Press special correspondent dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today, this city received telegraphs from the Chinese side in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, stating that the Japanese troops landed near Longmen at 3:00 PM yesterday, threatening Fangcheng and Qinzhou, west of Beihai. The Japanese are also attempting to land within Beihai proper. It is reported that fighting is currently underway near Longmen. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese sources today, the Japanese troops landed at Longmen yesterday were repelled by the Chinese side. However, the Japanese then sent a large number of reinforcements, completing the landing operation. It is also reported that Japanese cavalry have landed at Fangcheng, behind Qisha. However, Chinese reinforcements have rushed to the Longmen Bay area. According to senior Chinese military officials, based on the events of the past 24 hours, the Japanese landing operation is entirely a naval undertaking, with only small units of the army involved. At the same time, the Japanese troops in that area are also small units, so there will not be large-scale activities. The senior Chinese military official also stated that although the Japanese troops who landed at Longmen suffered a fierce counterattack from the Chinese army, they are still able to resist the Japanese army. (Eighteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin - A certain military observer stated when meeting with reporters this afternoon that the Japanese activities in the Beihai area were expected. Based on the situation in the past 24 hours, the Japanese are mainly using naval forces, with very few army troops. Their forces are limited, and it seems difficult to have large-scale actions. The Japanese troops at Longmen have already been repelled, and although there are still remnants in Qisha putting up resistance, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin - At 8:05 PM on the 15th, Japanese cavalry landed in Jiangpo Village, Fangcheng County. Japanese infantry continued to land in Qisha and Longmen. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin - On the morning of the 15th, there was heavy fog along the coast of southern Guangdong. Japanese warships took advantage of the fog to invade the coastal area of Fangcheng, China. At around 6:00 AM, Japanese warships fired hundreds of shells at the shore in the Qisha area. By 8:00 AM, more than 200 Japanese soldiers forcibly landed under the cover of intense naval and air firepower, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Today, this city received Japanese news that the Chinese army in the Beihai area is commanded by General Cai Tingkai. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin - At 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, the Japanese troops who forcibly landed near Longmen, Fangcheng County, were completely repelled by the Chinese garrison by 4:16 PM. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated today that Japan's landing in Beihai does not affect France's interests in the Far East. Beihai is currently the only coastal area in China that has not been occupied by the Japanese army. It is not surprising that the Japanese army has now occupied this area. The spokesperson declined to comment on the possibility that the Japanese army may cut off the connection between Guangzhou Bay and mainland China. French officials stated that although this move by the Japanese army will not immediately affect France's interests in the Far East, the French authorities will gradually pay close attention to this matter. France will cooperate with Britain and the United States to strive to protect the rights of Western democratic countries in China. (Sixteenth United Press special correspondent dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Guangdong Province - The Japanese army in Guangzhou has been greatly panicked after being attacked by the Chinese air force. Since the 4th, a blackout has been implemented at night. Japanese aircraft parked at the Tianhe and Baiyun airfields also take off in shifts to prevent Chinese air force attacks. The Chinese citizens are very excited. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Shaoguan - A telegram from Qin County states that the Japanese troops who invaded Longmen were severely attacked by the brave Chinese garrison and have retreated to the warships. A small number of Japanese remnants in Qisha are still stubbornly resisting and have not retreated. The Chinese army and civilians are joining forces to resist, vowing to eliminate the brutal Japanese. There are only five Japanese warships anchored in the Beihai area. Qin County is under alert all day today. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Shaoguan - More than 70 Japanese warships harassing the northern shore of Fangcheng, Qin County, South Road, repeatedly launched artillery attacks on the shore under the cover of Japanese aircraft. Japanese soldiers also boarded speedboats, attempting to land. After the Chinese army calmly fought back, the Japanese were still unable to land by 8:00 PM. Although the atmosphere in the battle area is extremely tense, the soldiers and civilians are calm as usual. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Northern Hunan Recaptures a Stronghold</h3>
<p>Miluo - The Chinese army in northern Hunan launched a surprise night attack in the rain on the Japanese troops at Xitang, Wujiang Bridge, Fenghuang Mountain, and Qijiapu on the evening of the 15th (all four locations are southeast of Yueyang). After four hours of fierce fighting, in addition to recovering Qijiapu, they also briefly broke into Xitang and Fenghuang Mountain, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and capturing seven light machine guns and more than 100 rifles. On the morning of the 16th, they were still advancing towards Wujiang Bridge. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha - The military situation in Hunan and Jiangxi has been in a stalemate for several days, with only occasional artillery battles and patrol contacts. Although the Japanese army on the opposite side has been frequently mobilized in recent days, their overall intention is still to suppress the Chinese guerrilla forces to reduce the threat to their defensive position. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Daning Largely Retreat</h3>
<p>Xingji - The Chinese army launched consecutive attacks on Wuyu Town. Fearing that their rear would be cut off by the Chinese, the Japanese troops in Daning largely retreated towards Kou County on the 13th and 14th. More than 600 Japanese troops from Shixian and Zaoshikou harassed Yonghe on the 13th. After being intercepted by the Chinese army in the Wujiazhuang, Pengmen, and Renjia Village areas, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji - After the Chinese army recovered Xiangning, the Japanese fled in two directions. One group is now entrenched in Nangang, south of Xiangning. The Chinese army continues to suppress them. The other group of more than 500 soldiers fled helter-skelter, suffering heavy losses due to constant interception by the Chinese along the way. They are currently fighting a certain unit of the Chinese army near Yitaitou. The Chinese army is stepping up the elimination of the remaining Japanese troops between Xiangning and Fencheng. Yesterday and today, fierce fighting took place on the entire line in places such as Niwangmiao, Yitaitou, and Duanling. The Chinese army has a significant advantage. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji - After Xiangning County was captured by the Japanese on the 24th of last month, the Chinese army occupied the high ground outside the city and attacked the Japanese army at any time. On the evening of the 11th of this month, the Chinese army launched an attack from four directions. Starting at 1:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, each route advanced and began fierce fighting with the Japanese army. By the afternoon, they had resolutely recaptured all the nearby strongholds and pressed on the city gates from all sides. The Japanese army retreated to the city. On the evening of the 12th, the Japanese army harassed areas such as Fujia Yuan and Ji Jia Yuan, but were repelled by the Chinese army. Fierce fighting continued throughout the 13th. The Japanese army was ultimately unable to reverse the downward trend. The Japanese troops in Hejin and Fencheng urgently dispatched reinforcements. More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Fencheng once went west to places such as Sanguanyu, Guanwangmiao, and Qianhouyetou. After being met by the Chinese army, they retreated. More than 200 Japanese troops from Hejin, from Guzhen and Xiaikou to Yangping Village, were ambushed by the Chinese army on their flanks. They were ultimately unable to withstand the attack and retreated along their original route. The Chinese and Japanese armies outside Xiangning City held each other until the morning of the 14th. The Japanese army, with reinforcements from both the southeast and southwest routes cut off, used all its strength to attack the Shili Pu and Pingyuan areas to the north, attempting to break through. They were again met with fierce resistance from the Chinese. The Chinese and Japanese armies near Pingyuan launched several fierce attacks. The Japanese army was ultimately defeated and fled south. After three days and nights of hard fighting, the Chinese army recovered Xiangning. According to statistics, the enemy lost 500 men, including one company commander of the rank of Captain named Morishige Taro. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Economic Warfare Against China</h3>
<p>Since Japan's invasion of China over two years ago, it has been exhausting its troops abroad and mobilizing its people at home, wavering at the crossroads of peace and war. Now, the news of the landing at Beihai has arrived. Beihai is a coastal port in the south of Hepu County. It was opened as a commercial port in the second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Initially, it served as the entry and exit point for products from Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. However, with the subsequent opening of Wuzhou, Nanning, Mengzi and others, it lost its commercial importance. Today, the Japanese army suddenly landed at Beihai, with the sole intention of cutting off the highway between Guangxi and Vietnam and attempting to attack Nanning (now called Yongning)! According to what the people of the Japanese Naval Ministry have declared; "The goal is to tighten the blockade of the South China coast. After the fall of Beihai, all Chinese seaports will be in Japanese hands," etc. It can be seen that their intention lies, in addition to military considerations, placing particular emphasis on economic ones. Nanning is the distribution center for goods in the Xijiang River basin, known as the "Guangxi Warehouse." It was opened as a commercial port in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Its commercial prosperity rivaled Wuzhou. Goods transported by sea mostly took the route through Beihai, and now there is a highway connecting Annam's Dong Dang and Lang Son. But even if the Japanese occupy the port of Beihai, it will be difficult to succeed in advancing north to spy on Nanning. Even if they want to cut off the Guangxi-Vietnam highway, the shortest distance is still 140 kilometers, which cannot be hoped to be achieved without preparing to sacrifice a large part of human and material resources. However, what is noteworthy is that the Japanese desire to end the war against China is like a child in urgent need of color, with a great sense of impatience. Now, in addition to military matters, politics and economy are being pursued simultaneously. Politics aside for now. Regarding the economic aspect, before occupying a place, they fear not destroying it to the fullest extent. Therefore, the bombing of airplanes often chooses undefended cities, destroying large commercial and industrial areas. After they have occupied it, they fear not encompassing everything thoroughly. Therefore, they take over all agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, shipping under the name of "control" and practice "monopoly." Knowing that a snake swallowing an elephant is difficult to digest, they seem not to care until they want to vomit and cannot.</p>
<p>Japan's economic warfare against China, in these past two years, has probably been regarded by themselves as a series of advances, full of pride. Their offensive in finance involves issuing "United Reserve Bank" banknotes in North China, thinking to seize the position of legal tender. Having difficulty succeeding, they turned to using banknotes from North China to exchange for foreign exchange in Shanghai, also without success. Then they thought to meddle in Central China, but the so-called "China Development" banknotes have difficulty gaining popularity in the occupied areas. They then shifted their fierce flames to customs duties, thinking that they could promote it without obstruction. Who would have thought that it would only increase the work on the abacus, and in practice, legal tender is still used for transactions, but it is merely a disguised increase in taxes. They also wanted to blockade the British concession in Tianjin and seize China's silver reserves. Although the British intend to seek compromise with the Japanese, they cannot easily change their Far East policy, which is based on trust and has been declared in advance. Without the consent and permission of the owner, they cannot dispose of their assets. This is what the British, who value contracts, are unwilling to do. As for the Japanese offensive against industry and commerce, on the one hand, they monopolize China's products and forcibly seize the property of Chinese people. It is called cooperation, but it is no different from communism. Merchants accumulate resentment and anger without expressing it. They then proceeded to undermine the commercial interests of third-country nationals. Without a Japanese "transport permit," goods could not be shipped to Shanghai, and at some ports, even "permits" were not issued, such as in the case of eggs. In short, the Japanese want all businesses and property in the occupied areas to be owned and operated by the Japanese, so as to facilitate their ability to plunder. Even if a peace agreement is reached, they will use the excuse of "fait accompli" and borrow for a long time without returning. This is why they seize so much without regard for anything. On the other hand, they also dump Japanese goods in the occupied areas, using unscrupulous merchants to impersonate national goods and sell them in the interior, and there are many such cases. According to reports from Chongqing, in the first eight months of this year, the value of Chinese products absorbed by Japan reached 435,640,000 yuan, while the value of Japanese goods imported into Chinese occupied areas reached 226,208,000 yuan. According to customs statistics, imports of foreign goods in the first, second, and third quarters of this year amounted to 1,061,731,564 yuan, of which Japanese goods accounted for 245,530,000 yuan, an increase of 116,334,000 yuan compared to the same period last year. This shows the intensity of Japanese dumping in the occupied areas. For the Japanese, it should be considered a cause for celebration. However, due to the unresolved military campaign against China, the opportunity to develop trade due to the European war was lost. As a result, it is not easy to obtain overseas raw materials and attract foreign exchange to save the increasingly powerful military system and the misfortune of industry and commerce. Then their gains in China may not compensate for their losses.</p>
<p>In addition, they are blockading various seaports under the control of the Chinese army. The blockade of the Wenzhou sea is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. The control of inland river and coastal shipping is increasing day by day. The Japanese's original mentality is still afraid that the control is not strict and that the net will leak fish. But they do not know that what the Japanese can control is Chinese goods, and what they cannot control is the hearts of the Chinese people. Moreover, military warfare is originally a rearguard or vanguard of economic aggression. If military warfare has a clear prospect of victory, then the economy is an object in the bag and can be planned slowly. If the victory or defeat of military warfare is still an unknown number, then the plunder of resources in the war zone is still feared not to be swept up completely. How can they delay for a moment. Therefore, it can be seen from the urgency of the economic strategy that the success or failure of the war can be seen. Then, as in the recent landing of the Japanese army at Beihai, who knows that the return of Hepu pearls is still not a short-term matter!</p>

In the afternoon, review committees for party affairs, politics, military, economics, and education were held. (1) The telegram to comfort all the soldiers fighting in the war of resistance, stated briefly, "For more than two years, we have been fighting against aggression. Our soldiers are loyal, brave, and more courageous as they fight. Their movements and strategies are all appropriate. Now, the shape of victory has appeared. This General Assembly unanimously resolved to extend its condolences. It is hoped that under the command of the supreme commander, they will work harder, gather great achievements as soon as possible, complete the work of the war of resistance, and achieve the cause of national construction. (2) The telegram to recognize overseas Chinese stated briefly, "Our Chinese nation has fought a desperate battle to defend national sovereignty and maintain world justice for twenty-nine months. Under the firm command of the supreme commander, the soldiers and civilians of the whole country are loyal and courageous, and they are becoming stronger as they fight. The foundation of victory has been laid, and the work of restoration can be seen. Our overseas Chinese have enthusiastically donated money, enabling all resources to be abundant over time. Their loyal plans and sincere considerations are mutually complementary with those who wear armor and fight on the front lines. Deeply thinking of their virtuous labor, we extend our sincere congratulations. We look forward to working together to accomplish great undertakings." (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dong Xian Guang Warns the Philippines</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Okabe, chairman of the Japanese International Culture Association, broadcast to the Philippines from Tokyo yesterday, stating that Japan has no ambition for the Philippines. Dong Xian Guang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda here, therefore warned the Filipinos, asking them not to over-believe this Japanese guarantee. This Japanese guarantee is completely empty talk. The sweet words that we have heard from the Japanese are even more touching than what Okabe said. Furthermore, Filipinos must be careful of the sweet words of Japanese politicians, because based on our experience, the Japanese often say one thing and do another. For example, Japan signed the Nine-Power Treaty with great seriousness, but Japan was the first to violate it. At the same time, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan also issued the same guarantees to China, but it was soon proven that this guarantee was completely empty talk. (Sixteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Current Military and Political Situation in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>A telegram from a certain location in western Suiyuan states that after arriving here on the 15th, the reporter saw that the wartime operations in Suiyuan were showing a lively and vigorous atmosphere in all aspects. Since April of this year, the Japanese army has not advanced a single step along the Ping Sui line. In addition to controlling the front with a large army, the Chinese side has also launched a wide range of guerrilla warfare on both sides of the railway. The Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to suppress the railway line, but all have failed. In addition, the Chinese army destroyed dozens of miles of railway, which has not been opened to traffic for two months. The Japanese then used a large part of their troops to encircle and attack Wuan, between Guyang and Wuchuan in China, and were defeated and retreated a few days ago. In the cities and counties occupied by the Japanese, the county, district, and township chiefs all exercise their rights within the territory to mobilize the masses. More than 4,000 intellectuals who have fled from the war zone have established a middle school to pursue further studies. More than 10,000 troops from the anti-Japanese forces in the whole province have successively returned. The regular army of the Chinese army in Wuan and the Mongolian armies are fighting bravely. The cooperation between the army and the people is getting closer. Since this year, all land taxes have been partially exempted, and the people are celebrating. More and more people are returning from the occupied areas. The leaders of the whole province, as well as the soldiers and civilians, are all extremely hardworking, persevering, and advancing calmly. As for the Japanese situation, they have been repeatedly attacked for half a year. They are urgently building bunkers around the strongholds, bridges, warehouses, and barracks in Baotou, Guihua, Fengzhen, and other places, surrounded by iron nets. On October 1, the puppet regime merged the three puppet autonomous governments of Mengjiang, northern Shanxi, and southern Chahar into the "Mengjiang Autonomous Government," located in Zhangjiakou, and still ordered Prince De to preside over it, with actual power in the hands of Imai. The original 400 or so puppet civil servants are now only 60 or so, which is the result of Prince De's firm request. Prince De was once passive because of this matter. Opium is everywhere on the Mongolian grasslands, and the Japanese are forcing it to be planted, ordering 20 taels of dry soil per mu to be produced, and buying each tael for 70-80 cents, and selling it for 7-8 yuan in the official opium shops. The Japanese are spreading gambling and prostitution and using flattery and enticement to win over young people, and then using the poisonous scheme of (using Chinese to control Chinese), but all have been exposed. Recently, 100 Mongolian recruits were trained in the Ulanqab League, but all of them fled to the Chinese side in less than a month. The awakening of the Mongolian people is extremely worthy of attention. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Production: Japanese Spies</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The General Headquarters Military Affairs Department is currently preparing to produce a film based on the book "Japanese Spies" by Italian author Fan Shibo, for screening in theaters nationwide. According to reports, Fan Shibo's book has become very popular since it was translated into Chinese, with six editions already published. The purpose of producing this film is to make people understand Japan's methods of occupying Northeast China and its means of ruling the Northeast. Hundreds of male and female artists have already volunteered to act in the film, and thousands of Chinese soldiers are also participating. The China Film Production Company, which is responsible for producing the film, is currently running large advertisements in local newspapers to solicit a large number of leather jackets, leather hats, and leather boots worn by Japanese soldiers in Northeast China, as well as wooden clogs and kimonos worn by Japanese women, and clothes worn by Chinese women in 1931. It is said that the entire film will focus on the espionage methods used by Japan. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>

At the hospitals, Madame Chiang also requested the staff to do their best to benefit the wounded soldiers. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly Battle Situation: 8th to 14th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (November 8th to 14th), Japanese troops on all fronts have continued to stir, and the Chinese army has continued to fight bravely, inflicting repeated blows. The Japanese army, after suffering repeated defeats, has become greatly demoralized. The more important aspects of the combat situation are described below:</p>
<p>Shanxi-Henan Area: The fighting in Shanxi Province has remained fierce in western Shanxi this week. After the Japanese occupied Jixian, Daning, and Xixian counties last week, the Chinese army quickly explored the terrain and strategies, launching a pincer attack on Xiangning from the northwest of Hejin in the south, and attacking Kecheng from the southeast of Shilou in the north. They completely recovered the two major strongholds of Xiangning and Kecheng, and then advanced to attack the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese army was unable to attend to both ends, and the entire line was shaken, collapsing simultaneously on all fronts. The southern route retreated from Jixian to Fencheng, the central route retreated from Daning to Pucheng, and the northern route retreated from Kecheng to QueLian. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, killing countless numbers, creating a great victory in another annihilation battle in the area. A mopping-up operation against the remaining Japanese troops is currently underway. In eastern Henan, the Chinese army has been attacking the Japanese troops in Taikang for days, killing over 300. On the night of the 9th, they once reached the city gate, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. At the same time, more than 1300 Japanese troops in Xinyang, southern Henan, once again harassed the Pingchangguan area, and after repeated attacks, the Japanese suffered hundreds of casualties and their offensive was thwarted. In addition, Japanese troops in Junxian and Tangyin, northern Henan, have repeatedly advanced west of Puyang, and after fighting on separate routes for two days and nights, many Japanese were killed. The situation has now become quiet.</p>
<p>Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi Area: The Japanese troops in Hanyang, Hanchuan, Qianjiang, and other places in central Hubei launched a two-pronged attack to the west last week, and Xiantao and Mianyang fell one after another, causing a tense situation at one time. Later, after a vigorous counterattack, important strongholds such as Fengkou and Tonghaikou were recovered one after another. In recent days, they have continued to advance, recovering Mianyang, and the vanguard has pressed to Xiantao, intensifying the siege. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. In addition, more than 2,000 Japanese troops on the left bank of the Xiang River have been attempting to cross to the east bank under the cover of artillery fire for days, but have been met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army and have not succeeded. The situation is currently in a stalemate. As for the northern Hunan-Jiangxi area, there have also been fierce battles in the past. On the northern Hunan front, the situation remains stalemated north of the Miluo River, up to the southeastern suburbs of Yueyang. On the right flank, the Chinese army is attacking Tongcheng and Linxiang, completely destroying Japanese transportation lines. The remaining Japanese troops in Tongcheng are still closely surrounded by the Chinese army, and their retreat route has been cut off and they will soon be completely annihilated. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Linxiang County on the evening of the 11th, killing many Japanese. The Chinese army advancing towards Fengxin in northern Jiangxi once rushed into the city on the evening of the 10th, burning down the Japanese barracks and warehouses before safely withdrawing. More than 3,000 Japanese troops in the Wuning and Gao'an areas launched a large-scale three-pronged attack on Minshan for days, but were met with resistance on separate routes, and a strong force ambushed the rear of the Japanese army. After several days of bloody battles, the Japanese army retreated completely on all fronts. The Japanese so-called "mopping-up" attempt in northern Jiangxi was thus shattered once again.

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Reports on Military and Diplomatic Situation in the House of Commons, Calls Dutch and Belgian Peace Appeals a Courageous Act, Alliance Between Britain and France Grows Stronger</h3>
<p>London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, representing Prime Minister Chamberlain, delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, reporting on the diplomatic and military situation of the past week. He first mentioned the peace appeals issued by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, calling them courageous acts. However, he also said that Chamberlain had previously stated that, based on past experience, it was difficult to expect the German government to submit a satisfactory reply. King George VI of Britain had declared in a reply to the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands that any proposal that could form a reasonable basis for peace would be considered. However, German head of state Hitler gave a speech in Munich on the 9th of this month, deliberately misinterpreting British policy. The country's propaganda machine then distorted the replies submitted by Britain and France, claiming that they rejected the peace appeals. This shows that the answer submitted by the country did not open the door to a satisfactory peace solution. According to German official announcements, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop notified the envoys of Belgium and the Netherlands yesterday in the name of Hitler, saying that since the peace proposal had been rejected by Britain and France, the German government had no choice but to consider it hopeless. This is also a sophistry. As for the military situation of the past week, rumors of German aggression against Belgium and the Netherlands are rampant. The British government, in accordance with its consistent policy, is very willing to respect the neutrality of these countries. However, given the large number of German troops concentrated in areas bordering Belgium and the Netherlands, and the open threats made by the country's newspapers against these countries, German aggression is imminent. All discerning people have already seen through this. Under such circumstances, it is to be expected that countries around the world unanimously despise Germany's superficially expressed peaceful words. No one in our country overestimates these words, and it is unnecessary to repeat them. As for the naval war, many enemy merchant ships are still docked in their own or neutral ports, and dare not sail as usual. In the past week, a total of four enemy ships were intercepted by our side. On the 12th and 13th of this month, enemy ships were scuttled by their crews. As for the air war, enemy planes once raided the Shetland Islands in our country. In addition, the air forces of both sides have been very active in recent days, mostly in fragmented actions, and no fierce battles have occurred. In general, there has been no special activity in the military field in the past half month, but the strength of our country's military and the determination of our nation have been fully demonstrated." As for the international situation in the past half month, the position of the allied countries of Britain and France has become stronger and stronger. "After the establishment of the new U.S. Neutrality Act, it has been able to continue to supply us with the armaments that it can supply. This is very important. As for the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, they have in fact broken down, which is disappointing." In addition, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski is currently holding talks with our authorities here to discuss the issue of the country's army joining the Allied forces. As for the visit of French Finance Minister Reynaud, the two sides discussed various economic and financial issues, proving that their views are completely consistent. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Cruiser Captures German Ship</h3>
<p>London: A British cruiser recently captured a German ship at sea yesterday and ordered it to sail to a port in the west. All two or three dozen crew members have landed. This ship is probably the "Leonté" (900 tons). At the beginning of the European war, it had taken refuge in the Spanish port of Vigo and only attempted to escape its internment now. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced that the British Contraband Control Committee detained 6,500 tons of contraband suspected of being shipped to Germany in the week ending November 11. During the same week, the committee considered 108 ship cases, and 86 cases that had not been resolved in the previous week. Two batches of goods were completely confiscated, 88 were completely released, and 43 had some goods confiscated. On November 11, there were 94 neutral ships berthed at the base of the British Contraband Control, 58 of which had been berthed at the base for less than a week. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague: According to a statement from the British Wartime Economic Bureau, 108 ships arrived at the southern seaports of Britain from November 5 to 11 to await inspection. The week before that, 86 ships arrived to await inspection, and they are still under British control and have not regained their freedom. It is reported that after inspection, the cargo of two ships was completely confiscated, and the cargo of 43 ships was partially confiscated. The cargo of 88 ships has already been released. However, according to a survey on November 14, there are still 94 neutral ships docked in British-controlled seaports. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Encounters on Various Parts of the Western Front</h3>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 146, stating, "Patrols from both sides engaged in encounters on various parts of the front today, and artillery fire from both sides was also very active." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 147, stating, "Nothing worthy of mention occurred on the front last night." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: Le Petit Parisien today published an article by Maurice, saying that both sides on the Western Front now seem to be waiting for the right moment to act, and the reported fighting is only a matter of some activity by the pickets. German pickets are only composed of a small number of soldiers in the dense forest areas of the Moselle and Rhine positions, located in the northeast area of Bitche and between the Lauter River, which has been the destination of German activity in the past few days. The Germans have also sent many reconnaissance patrols to operate in the lower reaches of the Vosges River to investigate the location of French resistance. The French are also engaged in reconnaissance, in enemy concentration areas outside the French line of defence, according to today's Figaro. German artillery recently engaged in firing at a certain point in the Moselle River area, (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Several Ships Continue to Sink in European Waters, Two Lithuanian Ships and Two British Ships</h3>
<p>Lithuanian National Capital: The Lithuanian cargo ships "Panaman" (2,400 tons) and "Nidan" (1,900 tons) recently sank one after another in the Estonian sea in the Baltic Sea. The "Nidan" was carrying a batch of British coal. The fate of the crew of the two ships is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>London: The British ship "George" (2,316 tons) recently struck a derelict ship floating in the northeastern waters of Britain and sank as a result. All crew members have been rescued. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Panama: The British regular liner "Matararo" (12,390 tons) recently arrived here. According to the crew, the ship was chased by a German submarine for 50 minutes en route from Britain to New Zealand. The British ship was eventually spared because of its greater speed. When the German submarine was first sighted, it was two and a half miles away. The captain immediately turned the wheel and accelerated forward. The submarine chased behind until it was about seven miles away. Although the British ship had defensive equipment, the captain said that he was ordered not to open fire unless attacked. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Beijing: The Belgian small steamer "Maurice, Margaret" sank in Dunkirk after hitting a French mine. Three sailors were buried at sea. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Trains Air Force Across the Country</h3>
<p>London: It is reported that two young air force officers who recently won the British Empire Medal previously learned aviation as bus drivers and members of a flying club, practicing for half an hour a day. After half a month, they obtained a pilot's license. In April of this year, they were promoted to junior officers in the Air Force, and now they have won the officer's Empire Medal for their proficiency in skills and courageous behavior. This shows the effectiveness of British pilot training. This training system has now been implemented in all parts of the Empire. The main training center is currently in Canada, with 4,000 people currently being trained and 10,000 to 15,000 people on the waiting list. India has now opened an Indian Air Force training station, and local princes are donating huge sums of money to develop air defenses, and the Prince of Hyderabad is even paying for the entire team of an air force detachment. Because there is gasoline supply in Iraq, it is also engaged in pilot training. Trainees from Australia will be trained in Egypt because the climate in Egypt is especially suitable. As for Germany, due to limited oil reserves, pilot training is very difficult, which is very different from the convenience of Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Rumor of Britain and France Forming a Customs Union Denied by British Officials</h3>
<p>London: There were rumours spreading that after French Finance Minister Reynaud came here and held talks with Finance Minister Simon, the two countries could form a customs union. However, official sources recently emphatically denied this, saying, "The talks were limited to technical issues arising from economic cooperation. For example, issues such as currency and exchange controls, and promoting trade, were all submitted for discussion, but both sides have no intention of unifying currencies at present, and France has never proposed this. In general, Britain and France have completely consistent views on current issues, but there is no need to establish a customs union" (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Attack Shetland, Bombs Miss</h3>
<p>London: According to the latest news, when German planes raided the Shetland Islands twice on Sunday, at least 16 heavy bombs were dropped. The previous report of 12 was inaccurate. Four of the bombs were deeply embedded in a certain muddy mountain area and did not explode. They were found last night and were all bombs capable of penetrating armor, each weighing about 250 pounds. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>German-Swedish Business Negotiations</h3>
<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry yesterday denied the report that Germany had put forward certain demands during business negotiations with Sweden.

(Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany Intensifies Training of Officers</h3>
<p>Paris: According to reliable sources here, there is evidence to indicate that Germany is actively striving to train officers through mass production methods. It is reported that Germany is still short of 15,000 officers, and even among the front-line officers, many lack sufficient experience. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-German Consultations on Opening Air Route</h3>
<p>Moscow: More than 40 people from German business circles arrived here yesterday, including four representatives from German airlines, who will consult with the Soviet authorities on opening an air route between Moscow and Berlin (via Warsaw).

<h3>Hungary Cracks Down on Political Activities</h3>
<p>Hungarian National Capital: Interior Minister Fecher delivered a speech in the House of Representatives yesterday evening, stating, "The government will do its utmost to suppress any kind of incitement." Members of the Parliament here were very satisfied after hearing this, saying, "The authorities of this country arrested several members of the National Socialist Party a few weeks ago. The party's members immediately withdrew from the House of Representatives to protest. Now, Interior Minister Fecher has made this speech in response to the party, which is deeply supported by the majority of members of other parties in the Parliament," (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Trade Delegation Arrives in Madrid</h3>
<p>Madrid: A British trade delegation has now arrived here and will begin negotiations with the Spanish authorities in order to amend existing trade agreements between Britain and Spain in accordance with wartime conditions. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Amau, Arrives</h3>
<p>Rome: The Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Amau (formerly Minister to Switzerland), arrived here this afternoon to take office. Representatives from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and staff from the Japanese Embassy welcomed him at the station. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Newspapers Advocate Maintaining an Independent Policy in the Far East, Cautioning Against British and French Flattery of Japan</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Daily News today warned the United States to be wary of the Allies' "flattery of Japan." It said, "We must remember that Britain and France never supported the United States in taking a firm stance against Japan's conquest of Manchuria in 1931." The newspaper's editorial was titled "Flattery of Japan," and solemnly stated the importance of the United States maintaining an independent policy in the Far East, saying that after Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in China, there is no reason for the United States' Far East policy to soften. "If we abandon our independent policy, we will gain nothing and will suffer all kinds of losses. It is very clear that the Allies are bargaining with Japan. A replay of the events of 1931 is happening. In 1931, we alone strongly protested against the Japanese military's invasion of Manchuria, while Britain isolated the United States and did not support it" (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Standard Star newspaper recently commented on the withdrawal of some troops stationed in North China by Britain and France, briefly stating that Britain and France have not abandoned their rights in China, and the firm attitude taken by the United States government should be maintained. "The U.S. government is about to announce the abrogation of the 1911 U.S.-Japan trade agreement, and is also consolidating naval bases in the Pacific. In addition, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the Japanese military's actions in China during a speech in Tokyo. The U.S. government has also sent a submarine fleet to the East Asian seas. All of this, in Japan's view, should be regarded as a warning that although the war hawks in that country want to exclude third countries in the Far East, the Western countries will not be willing to back down" (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Cornerstone Laid for Statue of Former US President Jefferson, Roosevelt Attends and Speaks</h3>
<p>Washington: The city is building a statue of the late President Jefferson, and the cornerstone laying ceremony was held yesterday. President Roosevelt personally attended and delivered a speech. "I very much hope to come again to participate in the unveiling ceremony of the late President's statue in January 1941." People then commented that President Roosevelt's term of office was originally due to expire on March 4, 1941, and what he said may imply that he will still submit his candidacy in next year's election, which is not impossible. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Tonnage of New US Cruisers May Increase</h3>
<p>Washington: Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison recently gave a speech to the press, saying that the US Navy has obtained extremely valuable lessons from observing the ongoing war in Europe, which can be used to build the new cruisers "Columbia" and "Crane Fulun." According to the current shipbuilding program, the tonnage of these two ships is 8,000 tons, and construction has not yet begun. However, since the provision in the London Naval Treaty prohibiting the construction of 10,000-ton cruisers has lost its effect due to Japan's lack of restraint, the tonnage of the "Columbia" and "Crane Fulun" may be increased. Regarding this level, well-informed sources here say that these new cruisers may be modeled after the German pocket cruisers. However, Secretary Edison said that the German pocket cruisers have not proven to be superior to similar warships from other countries, and the United States can still build better cruisers. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>New Antarctic Land to Belong to the United States</h3>
<p>Boston: The first Antarctic expedition to be organized by the US government in a century has decided that the motor ship North Star, which is setting out for the first time, will set sail for Little America near Antarctica today. The leader of the expedition, the famous explorer Admiral Byrd, will board the North Star later and declare that the land he has discovered belongs to the United States. He believes that it can be a safer new base for aviation between the United States and Australia. According to reports, Byrd was the first person to fly over the North and South Poles and one of the first to fly across the Atlantic. He completed these three great achievements in three and a half years, so he became famous before he turned forty. Byrd also made a name for himself in the US Naval Aviation Corps during the war.

<h3>Rosemary Wins Lawsuit</h3>
<p>London. Judge Burke of the High Court ruled today on Princess Hohenlohe's case against Lord Rosemary for breach of contract, finding in favor of Lord Rosemary. All allegations were dismissed. The plaintiff made two claims: (1) Damages for wrongful dismissal or cancellation of the employment contract. The court found that there was no stipulation preventing the plaintiff from accepting 25,000 pounds from an American publisher for publishing Hungarian sports manuscripts. Furthermore, the plaintiff's salary was paid until the end of 1938, at which point the contract would have expired without any notice from either party. (2) The defendant's obligation, in January 1933, to clear the plaintiff's name regarding defamatory news published in a French newspaper and to provide financial assistance. The court found that the defendant never assumed an obligation in the contract to clear the plaintiff's name or agreed in the contract to provide an annual allowance of 5,000 pounds to support the plaintiff for life. As for the confidential documents presented in court, none of them contained anything that would damage the reputation of the defendant or the sender. Any person of repute would naturally not want confidential correspondence with foreign heads of state to be disclosed in court. The court also found that the plaintiff obtained copies of these letters not from her employer, the defendant, but from individuals in Europe who corresponded with the defendant. The plaintiff has not provided a satisfactory explanation for how this occurred. Moreover, the plaintiff has been unable to continue obtaining confidential letters from the German Chancellery since January 1929, that the defendant had sent to the German Chancellery.

<h3>Soviet Furs Shipped to Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin. The Leipzig Fur Trade Delegation recently returned from Leningrad, where they inspected Soviet furs. It is reported that the Soviet Union will ship furs worth one million marks to Germany, including 14,000 Persian lambskins and 400 silver fox pelts. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Finnish Relations Worsen; Finland Actively Prepares; Finnish Representative Claims Negotiations Still Sought</h3>
<p>Helsinki. After the Finnish delegation returned here from Moscow, the Finnish cabinet convened a cabinet meeting to discuss whether the Finnish government should make a final effort to promote the resumption of Soviet-Finnish negotiations through diplomatic channels. It is also learned that the Soviet Minister to Finland is currently in Moscow and is not expected to return to his post for the time being. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Swiss National Capital. A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in the Finnish National Capital recently wired that, according to Finnish military sources, regardless of the outcome of future talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish National Government will maintain all precautionary measures taken until the end of the European war. However, the current troop levels will be reduced as the defensive works currently under construction are completed. It is also reported that responsible individuals in the country stated that the Finnish National economic and financial situation is very sound, preparations have not yet been utilized, and it will not be difficult to maintain the current precautionary measures to the greatest extent possible. Considering that Finland's foreign debt, calculated per capita, requires only one thousand Finnish marks per person, one can see the extremely good financial situation. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow. Soviet newspapers have recently been attacking Finnish reactionaries, claiming that they want to extend their country's borders to the Soviet Ural Mountains. At the same time, they are fiercely conducting anti-Soviet propaganda, falsely claiming that Soviet Russia is the same as Tsarist Russia, and failing to recognize that their country's independence was restored thanks to the Soviet October Revolution. Finnish newspapers have been inciting hatred towards the Soviet Union, and the Finnish authorities have even been guiding the people by killing Soviet soldiers. In short, the country is now leaning towards Western countries, especially those that have always been hostile to the Soviet Union. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. After meeting with the President, the chief representative of the Finnish delegation, Paasikivi, met with journalists yesterday and stated that neither Finland nor the Soviet Union has explicitly stated that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations have broken down, but the date for resuming negotiations has not yet been decided. Finland is still prepared to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, Finland fully trusts the treaties previously signed with the Soviet Union. Regarding the state of military preparations in Finland, Paasikivi declined to comment. Paasikivi then solemnly denied that Soviet aircraft had attacked Finnish coastal cities. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. The Moscow radio station today again attacked Finland with strong words, accusing the Finnish rulers of being under the protection of Britain. This is the second attack on Finland by the Moscow radio station since the suspension of Soviet-Finnish negotiations. The first attack occurred on the day the Finnish delegation was recalled, accusing Finland of failing to notify the Soviet authorities of the flood threat from border rivers. This second attack occurred shortly after the Finnish representative arrived in Finland. The chief Finnish representative, Paasikivi, told people after returning home that the Soviet claim of Finnish economic difficulties was absurd and that economic pressure from the Soviet side had no effect on Finland. Finland is currently implementing various precautionary plans to cope with other possible difficulties. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Danzig. According to the Danzig Times today, citing as-yet-unconfirmed reports, the Soviet Union is planning to abolish the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty. Finnish sources also claim that Finland has completed the construction of fortresses and defensive works in the area bordering the Soviet Union, and Finnish troops have moved into new positions to defend them. As for the neuro-warfare that the Soviet Union intends to adopt, Finland is also prepared to experience it. It is expected here that after the Finnish Finance Minister Tanner returns here from Moscow, he will issue several laws restricting the economy and finances to cope with the pressure from the Soviet side. At the same time, Finnish officials are confident that Finland will be able to borrow foreign debt, at least from Sweden and the United States. Domestically, the government's national defense bonds worth ten million US dollars have been fully sold, and the Finnish people's patriotic donations have reached as much as 1.5 million US dollars. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. A large storm occurred in the Gulf of Finland, and the water level of the Neva River rose three feet, causing considerable damage to the village of Leningrad. The Soviet side therefore criticized Finland, claiming that if Finland's weather reports had not stopped, the residents of Leningrad would have been able to take precautions. However, according to Finnish newspapers, Finland's weather reports have been stopped for several months, not just today, but have only recently been resumed. Therefore, the Soviet side's criticism is completely unfounded. Furthermore, according to reports from Tallinn, Estonia, a large storm occurred in the Gulf of Finland, damaging many of the Soviet seaplanes parked there. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow. Professor Bakh, a well-known Soviet biologist and member of the Academy of Sciences, (who attended the Supreme Soviet as a representative,) published an article in the Soviet trade union newspaper today, expressing indignation at the United States' interference in the Soviet Union's negotiations with Finland, and warning the United States to "mind its own business and not interfere in the affairs of others." According to Professor Bakh, President Roosevelt's sudden expression of concern for Finland has surprised the Soviet public, because the threat to Finland is not the Soviet Union, but its domestic leaders. The Finnish reactionaries are now acting as tools for war provocateurs, placing Finland entirely on a war footing, and causing the lives of the Finnish people to decline day by day. Moreover, the demands made by the Soviet Union on Finland are not only extremely reasonable, but have been conceded as much as possible. Our demands are absolutely indispensable to the Soviet Union. I firmly believe that the Soviet government will be able to carry out its original intentions to defend our industrial capital. Anyone who interferes with this action of the Soviet Union must be repelled with extreme determination. The United States, as a country of gold and monetary imperialism, has placed the entire Americas under its control in the name of the Monroe Doctrine. What qualifications does it have to speak on the actions of the Soviet Union? (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italy Maintains Armed Peace; Mussolini's Speech</h3>
<p>Rome. Premier Mussolini delivered a speech yesterday from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia to tens of thousands of people, including several thousand students. He said, "You must study in calmness and discipline, and keep a gun by your books. What our country wants to maintain is armed peace, not cowardly peace." Informed sources here commented that this is further proof that Italy is still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the current European war. However, Italy is ready and will assume a peace mission when the opportunity arises. The entire meaning of the Prime Minister's speech regarding all current events is nothing more than that. Some observers also said that during yesterday's demonstration, the students shouted slogans such as "Corsica Tunis," but the crowd did not respond. However, Italy's desire for the Mediterranean and North African French territories has not been abandoned and can still be seen here. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome. Italian Daily editor Gaida broadcasted to the United States today, saying that Italy hopes for a solution to the colonial problem. Italy was sold out by the Treaty of Versailles, which did not give Italy colonies. Italy's goal is the political and economic harmony of the Balkan countries and the free and equal solution of the colonial problem. Prime Minister Mussolini's calm and armed policy is based on waiting and vigilance. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador to France Presents Credentials; Anglo-French Sincere Cooperation</h3>
<p>Paris. The new British Ambassador, Sir Campbell, went to the Presidential Palace this morning to present his credentials to President Lebrun, and delivered a eulogy, stating that both countries can cooperate sincerely, fully understand each other, and must work together to cope with the current dangers. He said, "When my predecessor, Sir Phipps, presented his credentials to Your Excellency several years ago, our two countries already had the desire to maintain peace, and later made many efforts, but the desire for peace ultimately became a bubble. Today, our two nations are forced to fight against aggressive countries in order to defend a tradition of hundreds of years, and are well aware that the safety of the territory and the future are shaken. Only by achieving victory can we enjoy peaceful happiness and protect the right to exist. To achieve victory, our two countries must be united. As far as my country is concerned, we deeply admire the bravery and calmness of the people of your country, and will cooperate with all national resources. The fate of Europe depends on how our two countries cooperate. I am very honored to be able to contribute to this." President Lebrun immediately replied, "Your two countries' thoughts and actions are absolutely consistent, and the close relationship between the two countries is unprecedented." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Dutch-Belgian Peace Proposal; Germany Responds; Believes This Movement Has Ended; German Foreign Minister Meets with Belgian and Dutch Envoys</h3>
<p>Swiss National Capital. According to Berlin sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Belgian Ambassador Davignon and Dutch Minister Weede this morning and informed them in the name of Führer Hitler that the German government had no choice but to consider the peace proposal of Belgium and the Netherlands to have failed since it had been rejected by Britain and France. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris. Diplomatic figures here commented on the fact that the German government did not respond to the peace proposal by the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands until today, saying that this is further proof that Germany's strategy is to shift the responsibility for prolonging the war onto Britain and France. Earlier, Belgium and the Netherlands had come forward to mediate once in late August, at which time Germany rejected it, claiming that it was launched too late and that the move was sufficient to facilitate Britain and France. Now it is openly said that the peace that the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands decided to mediate could not be realized because of the answers from Britain and France, hoping to deceive world opinion. It only sees its efforts being unsuccessful. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Belgian Capital Brussels. After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop rejected the peace proposal of the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands in the name of Führer Hitler, well-informed sources here declared that the German government may not issue a formal note again, but Führer Hitler may send a telegram to the heads of Belgium and the Netherlands in a private capacity to explain the reasons for the rejection. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. According to responsible persons here, the Dutch government will thoroughly study the Dutch-Belgian peace proposal from Germany, carefully examine the current situation, and consult with Belgium. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague. This morning, Dutch newspapers published prominently the news that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had given the German response to the peace proposals of the two Dutch and Belgian heads of state to the envoys of the two countries stationed in Germany. The Dutch newspapers pointed out that Britain and France resolutely rejected the peace proposals, so Germany now also talks about the fact that the mediation business has ended. After receiving the news, the Dutch government contacted the Belgian government to exchange views on the current situation. The New Rotterdam Daily believes that readers should not rush to a conclusion on this matter, because Germany rejected the mediation because Britain and France rejected the peace proposals. If Britain and France explained that they did not mean to reject the proposals abruptly, then Germany might not necessarily fail to consider them. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>Situation Eases at Dutch-Belgian Border</h3>
<p>Paris. Informed sources here said that although the tense situation at the border between Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands has eased, the German troops and military equipment concentrated in the border areas in the past week have not been withdrawn. From a purely military point of view, the German army can still launch at any time, and the threat to Belgium and the Netherlands has not diminished. However, Belgium and the Netherlands have taken the necessary precautions, and their defenses have become stronger day by day. At the same time, the French government has also taken the necessary measures in the border area to cope with any German attempts. Although Germany is still ready to give it a try, its current enemies and future enemies have already prepared and rested, and all things that may succeed by chance are absolutely impossible. Therefore, the hope of its success is greatly reduced. In addition, winter is approaching, and if the country wants to launch something at this time, it will be more difficult. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Belgian Capital. All public buses in the city that were requisitioned by the government were returned in full today, and buses on all routes have been running as usual. (Havas Military, 16th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. The canal between Amsterdam and the North Sea, which was previously closed for night navigation due to the tense situation from Sunday, has now been reopened. This can be seen as another indication that the Netherlands is gradually becoming quieter. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Polish Premier Engaged in Activities in England; Talks with British Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>London. Since arriving at this inquiry the day before yesterday, General Sikorski, the Prime Minister of Poland, is conducting talks with various members of the British Cabinet. It is reported that the most important issues being discussed are the organization of Polish troops fighting on the Western Front and the relief of Polish refugees. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London. General Sikorski, the Prime Minister of Poland, gave a speech in French at a banquet of the Foreign Correspondents Association here, saying, "From a personal point of view, the current war did not come out of our intentions, and has already transcended the conflict between countries. Whether the principles of law and justice that all mankind should follow can be extended depends on who wins this war. Today, fair observers have felt that all mankind must choose between two different collective lives. One is the way of life expressed by Britain, France, and the United States, and the other can be represented by the horizontal occupation of Austria and Czechoslovakia and the horizontal division of Poland. After my trip to conduct talks with the British authorities, it has been proven that the governments of the two countries have the same views, and their connection is very strong. The Polish army is being reorganized in the territory of Britain and France, and the British and French governments have given great support in spirit and in material. Our team is also cooperating with the strong British fleet. All our sailors are welcomed by their British comrades. It is expected that our land and air forces can fight together with the friendly forces of the Allied countries of Britain and France in a few months. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of German Political Prisoners Arrested</h3>
<p>Swiss National Capital. The Sérère City Daily reported that German political police arrested no fewer than 1,000 people yesterday, most of whom were socialists and communists released from concentration camps, as well as monarchists, Christian intellectuals, and Jews, and even National Socialists. More arrests are expected to follow. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Munich. After the bomb explosion at the Bergeru Hotel in Munich, which killed seven people, it has been learned that another person (Michael Shiguode) died of his injuries the day before yesterday. His funeral was held here today, and representatives from the party and government attended the ceremony. There were many spectators. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Manchukuo Economy Severely Affected by European War; Soybeans Cannot Be Shipped to Germany; Japan and the Soviet Union Prepare to Negotiate</h3>
<p>Changchun. After the outbreak of the European War, the economy of "Manchukuo" has been severely affected. Exports of soybeans and their by-products to Germany have now stopped, and many urgently needed materials taken from Germany are also unable to be obtained. Many factories built to install German machinery are now empty. Industry in the territory is also very lacking, and imports are difficult to resume. The negotiations between Changchun and Tokyo on giving priority to Japanese imported goods being shipped into Manchuria have not been successfully completed. The monopolistic system originally intended to expand "Manchukuo's" export trade has become a pie in the sky. All the warehouses north of Dalian are now piled high with goods, relying solely on Japanese consumption, which is not enough to create a balance of foreign trade. Those with knowledge say that shipping soybeans by rail through Siberia to Germany is nonsense. Leaving aside the amount of freight, the lack of vehicles in "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union is even more of a problem. As for the idea of refining soybean essence and shipping it to Germany, chemists also believe it is impossible, because the ingredients of soybeans cannot be refined into fine particles, making it economically and commercially suitable for transportation on the Siberian Railway. Therefore, what "Manchukuo" is currently encountering is the difficulty that countries around the world have failed to solve for a hundred years. Agricultural authorities are now planning to change agricultural production so that the territory can be self-sufficient and have a surplus to be exported to other countries in exchange for urgently needed industrial products. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. After meeting with Soviet Ambassador Smetanin for 50 minutes yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura decided that the agenda of the Chita Conference should be limited to the Nomonhan issue. The Asahi Shimbun said, "The border between 'Manchukuo' and the Soviet Union can be finally demarcated next spring. Negotiations to extend the 1928 Fisheries Agreement for 12 months will also be held soon." (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Kyushu Daily President Kiyomizu Yoshitaro publicly published a letter yesterday, advocating that Japan should conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, emphasizing that Japan's understanding with the Soviet Union is an absolute prerequisite for realizing its policy towards China. War between Japan and the Soviet Union, or even strained relations, will strengthen the position of Britain and the United States in the Far East. Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov has stated that the Soviet Union is willing to seek understanding with Japan, so the Japanese government should seize the opportunity, actively strive to overthrow the pro-British and pro-Russian traditional principles, and issue a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. If it can be realized, it will not hinder Japan's negotiations with Britain and the United States, but will be enough to make the negotiations easier. (Haitong Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The new Soviet Ambassador, Smetanin, will be received by the Japanese Emperor on November 20 to present his credentials. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Economic Committee Met Yesterday; Welles Gave a Speech</h3>
<p>Washington. The Pan-American Economic Committee met here, and US Undersecretary of State Welles first gave a speech, saying, "We are now starting work in an extremely favorable situation. The determination of the American republics to maintain the security and peace of the Western Hemisphere is known to the world." The task of this committee is to propose appropriate measures to stabilize the business relations of the American countries that have been affected by the European War, and at the same time to always find ways to increase the volume of trade between the American countries. I propose to elect a subcommittee to "discuss ways to develop and facilitate business, improve monetary and financial institutions, promote sound production and investment matters, improve transportation and communication methods, and communicate technical knowledge and experiences from all parties to make the most of them." In addition, I also advocate that the American countries conduct negotiations to discuss bilateral business terms to develop trade, and improve the non-competitive agricultural and industrial products of all parties. All American countries have the possibility of using foreign capital to develop natural resources, and all departments of the United States government should cooperate with other American countries in the most friendly spirit." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3>Finance Heavy Selling Resurges, Morning Foreign Exchange Market Again Shows Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning in the foreign exchange market, the opening price announced by HSBC was flat. The black market for British and American currencies, contrary to the quiet of the previous few days, entered a state of tension again. It was at its lowest around noon, reaching a rate of 5 shillings, 4 pence, 6875. However, by closing time, it had recovered slightly to 5 shillings, 2.25 pence. The morning opened relatively stable, but after 9:30 AM, heavy selling suddenly began. It was estimated that Hong Kong Electric, speculators, and outsiders such as Chase National Bank, the Dutch Bank, and Anda Bank eagerly sold off. Furthermore, due to the spread of unfavorable news that German troops had begun to invade the Dutch border from a certain defense line, and that important British military meetings were discussing countermeasures, it was also heard that German merchants, due to the expansion of the European situation, had wired orders to Hong Kong to sell off. As a result, the selling became more intense, and HSBC's appetite for buying became increasingly weak, leading to a breakdown in support. The American exchange rate almost broke the 9 yuan mark, reaching 8.9375 yuan, and the British pound also rose to 5 shillings, 4 pence, 6875. However, the selling soon subsided slightly, and importers, seeing the low prices, quickly and decisively bought in. HSBC's intention to buy was also strong at this time, causing the market to turn around briefly, dropping to 5 shillings, 3.4375 pence and 8.75 yuan. However, the closing price at noon turned softer again. In the afternoon, due to Japanese banks entering the market to buy, and HSBC's appetite for buying remaining strong, the lowest rate recovered to 5 shillings, 2.25 pence and 8.59375 yuan. After hovering around this level, the market soon closed, with the British pound at 5 shillings, 2.96875 pence and the American exchange rate at 8.6875 yuan, slightly firmer by 0.078125 and 0.125 compared to the previous day. It was heard that the trend of futures was the same as that of spot, but the result was slightly squeezed, with the British pound differing by 0.0625 and the American exchange rate differing by 0.125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of about 1%. Trading throughout the day was active.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate Almost Breaks the 9 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>The morning initially opened with London large bars at a recent increase of 0.0625 and a long-term increase of 0.125. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar, Shanghai currency, and the French franc were all flat, with the US dollar against the British pound up 0.375, against the French franc up slightly by 0.125, and against Shanghai currency unchanged. The central bank's posted rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 5 shillings, 2.1875 pence for the British pound and 8.5625 yuan for the American exchange rate, with no significant change compared to the previous closing prices. The opening was initially stable, but at 9:30 AM, HSBC's announced opening price remained unchanged. After the silver balancing tax was announced, increasing by 0.5%, Hong Kong Electric and local speculators suddenly began heavy selling, and outsiders such as Chase National Bank, the Dutch Bank, and Anda Bank also competed to sell off. In addition, HSBC's appetite for buying was weak, so the market trend became sharply weaker. The British pound rose from 5 shillings, 2.8125 pence to 4.6875 pence, and the American exchange rate also firmed from 8.625 yuan to 9375 yuan. After that, the selling subsided slightly, and foreign firms took advantage of the low prices to buy in. HSBC's appetite for buying was very strong. It was reported that a certain foreign firm bought spot American exchange rate at 8.875 yuan. Subsequently, HSBC absorbed spot British pounds from Hong Kong Electric and speculators from 5 shillings, 4.0625 pence to 3.75 pence, and then it softened to 5 shillings, 3.4375 pence and 8.75 yuan. At noon, HSBC stopped buying and the market firmed again. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5 shillings, 3.75 pence for the British pound and 8.8125 yuan for the American exchange rate, with the British pound weaker by 0.15625 and the American exchange rate cheaper by 0.25 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Suddenly Active in the Afternoon Market</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, due to the sudden activity of Japanese banks and HSBC's slight appetite for buying, although Hong Kong Electric continued to sell off, it was still insufficient to meet demand, so the situation turned slightly tighter. HSBC's Japanese bank bought spot British pounds from Hong Kong Electric at 5 shillings, 3.4375 pence and 2.8125 pence. Later, the Japanese bank also purchased spot American exchange rate at 8.75 yuan and 6875 yuan. After the purchase, the British pound softened to 5 shillings, 2.25 pence and 8.59375 yuan. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5 shillings, 2.96875 pence for the British pound and 8.6875 yuan for the American exchange rate, with the December British pound at 5 shillings, 2.34375 pence and the American exchange rate at 8.5625 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British pound weakened by 0.078125 and the American exchange rate strengthened by 0.125, with the spot British pound cheaper by 0.109375 and the American exchange rate higher by 0.1875 for futures.</p>

<h3>Speculators Emerge En Masse, Gold Market Turns Around After Falling, Lowest at 3,570 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash-settled black market conditions for gold were initially strong due to the sudden deterioration of the environment. Later, due to the sharp rise in the exchange rate and the false claims of the shorts, causing those hoping for lower prices to hesitate and sellers to emerge in droves, the market was flooded with chips. The price fell to 3,570 yuan at one point. In the entire process, the exchange market opened flat in the morning, and a certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, raised the price by 10 yuan, reaching a daily high of 3,670 yuan. Subsequently, news that the foreign exchange rate had softened caused the speculators to become discouraged. A certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, emerged, and securities firms also followed suit to sell off. Although a certain money exchange speculator was still actively buying in, the overall supply still exceeded demand, and the price fell to 3,635 yuan. However, at this time, silver shops, acting on behalf of Hong Kong customers, bought in some gold, so the price temporarily rebounded by 15 yuan. Ultimately, due to the continued weakness in foreign exchange, the shorts took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the securities firms continued to sell off aggressively. The money exchange speculator also reluctantly cut their losses, and the market lacked support, plummeting to a low of 3,570 yuan. By noon, the foreign exchange rate tightened slightly, and money exchange firms bought in at low prices, while those with short positions also quickly took profits, raising the price by 40 yuan to close at 3,610 yuan. In the afternoon, the market weakened again to 3,595 yuan. In the middle, the foreign exchange rate turned tighter, and gold firms suddenly took long positions and bought in, causing the price to rise sharply to 3,645 yuan. However, the closing price fell back to 3,622 yuan, squeezed down by 38 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading throughout the day was active, with about 1,500 taels traded. Jewelry shops reduced their listed prices for gold ornaments by 5 yuan. Customs gold and other gold prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Squeezed Down by 38 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), the situation was stable due to the price being raised by speculators. The market opened five yuan higher, and the money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a certain Yu firm at 3,665 yuan. Then it rose another five yuan, and a certain gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm at 3,670 yuan. Subsequently, news that the foreign exchange rate was softening caused a selling spree. A certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, came out to sell, and securities firms also sold off aggressively. Although a certain money exchange firm still had an appetite for buying, it was difficult to counter the selling pressure. The price soon plummeted by 35 yuan, and a certain gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,635 yuan. After that, silver shops bought in on behalf of customers, and the market temporarily rebounded, rising by 15 yuan. Silver shops bought 50 taels of cash from gold firms for 3,650 yuan. Later, due to the intensifying weakness of the foreign exchange rate, the selling spree resumed. Securities firms and retail investors competed to sell, and a certain money exchange firm also aggressively sold short, causing the market to plummet again by 80 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,570 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market softened slightly, and money exchange firms bought in cheaply, causing the market to rebound slightly, rising by 40 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a gold firm for 3,610 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon market initially remained weak. Silver shops first sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,605 yuan, down by 5 yuan. Later, securities firms also sold off, down another 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,595 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market suddenly turned tighter, and a certain gold firm suddenly had an intention to buy, rising by 50 yuan. A securities firm bought 30 taels from a gold firm for 3,645 yuan. After the purchase, the foreign exchange rate stabilized slightly, and the gold firm took profits and sold off, falling by 25 yuan. The gold firm sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,620 yuan. Later, cash gold firms bought in dozens of taels, raising the price by 5 yuan. A cash gold firm bought 20 taels from a securities firm for 3,625 yuan. Then, the gold firm bought 20 taels from the money exchange firm for 3,622 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price was squeezed down by 38 yuan compared to the previous day. It was found that the price had fallen for five consecutive days, totaling 108 yuan. The price fluctuated by 100 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher for cash settlement, and the buying price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current margin gold is about 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>

As a result, major firms changed their listed price to 365 yuan. The new firms had the same price as the previous one, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, demand for British and American gold pounds was sluggish, and market prices continued to weaken. Demand for British and American gold notes was still strong, and market prices initially weakened and then firmed. British gold notes once fell to 43 yuan and 6 jiao, and American gold notes fell to 11 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 fen. In the afternoon, demand turned stronger, and British gold notes rose back to 40 yuan, and American gold notes rose back to 11 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, American gold notes were still squeezed down. Hong Kong notes were weak due to abundant supply in the Hong Kong exchange market. Demand for Singapore rupiah notes was scarce, and market prices were soft.

<h3>Securities Foreign Stocks Firm and Rise Sharply, Especially</h3>
<p>—Domestic Debt Slightly Recovers—</p>
<p>Yesterday's security black market, due to the Japanese army landing in the North Sea, the emptiness of people's hearts was taken advantage of, and the market price fell. Class C shares broke through the 7 yuan mark again. Fortunately, a portion of the speculators maintained a firm grasp, and the downward trend slowed. However, the trend of decline showed no signs of recovery. The future may see another period of fluctuation due to the speculators' wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday morning, Lianyi Sheng bought in large quantities, and Yongkang and Jiufeng sold out, but there were no major transactions, and the market price still tended to weaken slightly. In the afternoon, Lianyi Dafeng had demand, and Hongkang had a slight appetite for buying, but Jiufeng and Tongkang still looked to sell short, so the price still could not rise. As a result, except for Class A shares, which had fallen more sharply the previous day, and therefore recovered by 5 fen, the rest continued to fall by about 1 to 2 jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading Transactions Deda Shipping Company shares, 100 shares, price 35 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the stock market at the Public Industry Association was particularly strong. Steel stocks were the most popular, followed by Shanghai Bank shares. In fact, all well-known stocks benefited and rose. In the afternoon, although the stocks were still active, they were soon hit by a wave of profit-taking, and could not extend their gains, as some people imagined that the market had risen too much. However, the underlying trend remained very firm. The rubber quota for the first quarter of the next year has now been decided to be 80%. This has a minimal impact on rubber stocks. Yesterday's trend remained firm and stable.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Telegraph) Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds in London saw minimal fluctuations. Sino-French US dollar bonds fell back by 2 pounds to 48 pounds, and the Peking-Mukden Railway continued to rise by 3 pounds to 55 pounds. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Telegraph) Today, the listed prices of British Far East company stocks in London saw more gains than losses. Mercantile Bank shares fell by 5 shillings to 7 pounds and 15 shillings. The Korean Coal Mine rose by 1 shilling to 6 shillings and 1 pence. Kulim Rubber shares rose by 11 pence to 19 shillings. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn Cotton Standing by to Observe, Yarn Market Optimistic but Difficult</h3>
<p>The yarn market is sluggish and lifeless, temporarily hovering on the horizontal line, waiting for opportunities to change again. As for general operators, their goals are mostly bullish, because the price of raw cotton is falling unreasonably, and the profit margin of factories is decreasing, so there are quite a few people buying in at low prices. However, the exchange rate is rising step by step, and actual sales are also quiet and show no signs of improvement. The situation is still firming, and it is very expensive to settle down. However, the number of transactions in the market has decreased significantly, and the atmosphere is dull and scattered.</p>
<p>When the yarn market opened in the morning, traders gathered to discuss the rumor that the Japanese army had landed in the North Sea, fearing that it would affect the yarn market. Everyone stood by to observe. Then, those who wanted to make a quick profit first sold 10 bales, with the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 642 yuan, down 6 yuan. A little later, a certain trader who was optimistic about the market came back to buy in a few hundred bales, rising back by 2-3 yuan. In the middle, news that the exchange rate was softening and actual demand was sluggish, and the market situation remained in a state of徘徊. It was found that 890 bales were traded in half a day. The number of transactions in the afternoon of the previous day was 205 bales. The prices of 30-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan, Double Globe yarn fell by 4 yuan, and Tiannv yarn fell by 5 yuan, but the market continued to weaken after closing, falling another 2 yuan. Today, 310 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each帮口 is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn Sales Slack, Cotton Market Deteriorates Daily</h3>
<p>The number of cotton transactions has decreased, but traders have made some transactions. Cotton seeds are also relatively scarce, and the market is not as lively as it used to be, because the yarn market is slack, the factories' intentions are scattered, and consumption is sluggish. In addition, American cotton prices have also fallen, and the American exchange rate has risen sharply, so the situation is also firm but level. As for Japanese factories, they have no plans to purchase due to the recent decline in the yarn market. 3,958 bales of Subei cotton from Tonghua source and 370 bales of Beisha cotton have arrived.

At the beginning of yesterday's opening, the market was still active, and traders traded a lot, resulting in a slight increase of 2-3 pounds.

India, including forecasts, rose by one rupee. Egypt has been closed for two days. Yesterday's price rose by nearly 40 pounds. Liverpool rose by 2-3 pence.</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs 蘆羊尖 Firm and Active</h3>
<p>New Japonica Rice and Kiln Seed Follow the Trend, Afternoon Return Slightly, Transactions in Foreign Rice</p>
<p>粳尖 After the rice market fell once the day before yesterday, the general situation was still weak at the beginning of yesterday's opening due to the remaining momentum from the day before yesterday. Generally, the cargo owners also rarely showed samples, so the early market phenomenon still felt徘徊. Suddenly, in the middle market, locals took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market became tighter. The general buyers competed to purchase, and the domestic帮 smoothly handled the second-grade rice, and the market price was uniformly raised by about half a yuan. The supply continued to reach 3,400-3,500 bales of Carrousel brand, while囤戶 did not take action. As a result, although the number of transactions in the entire city was旺, exceeding 10,000 bales, the price of each product only increased by 2-3 jiao. The price of new Japonica rice and Kiln Rice increased by 2-3 jiao because it had been cut through the day before yesterday. Only 蘆羊尖 was sparsely supplied, the stock in the warehouses was weak, and the quality was better than the customer rice, and it was a by-product of Japonica rice, so the shops had a special appetite, so the settled land was solid, and the price continued to rise by 1-2 jiao to 3-4 jiao. The closing market price was 29 yuan, 3 jiao for special 蘆尖, 28 yuan, 7-8 jiao in the middle, 28 yuan, 7 jiao to 28 yuan for special 羊尖, 27 yuan, 7-8 jiao for second-grade, which was similar to the price of ordinary Japonica rice. To the old-new variation yuan, everything belongs to挺秀.</p>
<p>客秈 In the morning market, under the influence of the flood of Japonica rice, the market once fell by 3-4 jiao. Then there was speculative absorption, and it was rumored that the Japanese-run 蕪米 may need to be transported abroad, and cannot be delivered to Shanghai in large quantities. Those who had sold off a month ago will not be able to deliver on schedule, so they repurchased the sold warehouse receipts in the market. Therefore, people's hearts were excited, and the price suddenly rose by nearly a yuan, which was still 5-6 jiao higher than the day before yesterday. However, by the afternoon, it was heard that there was a transaction of foreign rice, and the market and people's hearts fell again. Throughout the day, 3,600 bales of high 蕪秈 were opened at a price of 28 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>洋米 The foreign rice trade, which had been brewing for several days, was officially concluded yesterday. A batch of Saigon No. 1 rice, 2,400 tons, was priced at 30 yuan and 6 jiao per bale, to be loaded from December 8, and delivered to Shanghai Pudong or buoy. The seller was達孚洋行, and the buyers were all retail distributions. There are still ten batches, including合義洋行, etc., priced at 31 yuan, and the delivery at the Puxi warehouse has not yet been settled.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Soybean Oil Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Up Twelve Yuan and Zero Compared to Last Month. There are actually those who want to raise it to eighty yuan.</p>
<p>Since a portion of the soybean oil market has been controlled, and the source is scarce, under the double pressure, the rising momentum has been formidable in the past two days. Compared with the highest price on the same day last month, the market price has risen by more than twelve yuan. What is the reason for such crazy monopoly? Yesterday, the price of barrel oil rose by another three yuan compared with the previous day, and the price of 簍油 rose by two yuan and 5-6 jiao, but only a few buyers took profits and closed their positions, so the number of transactions was not large, because generally, those who hold goods are still looking at the eighty-yuan market. Yesterday,十桶 of Dalian oil was opened (price details in the market price column), 50桶 of Qingdao oil, 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, 20 pieces of Luhuo oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 20 pieces of Luhuo oil, and 100担 of oil from this factory. Peanut oil was completely driven up by soybean oil by two or three yuan. Sales and exports were unchanged. The local market asked about 250 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 50桶 of Qingdao barrel oil, and 30桶 of Jiangbei barrel oil.</p>

However, the association's marked price continued to fall due to the small number of actual sales.

<h3>Hygiene for Married Life in Early Winter</h3>
<p>— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, Venereal Disease Specialist, and Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Sichuan Road, Beijing Road</p>
<p>(Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Sunday by Appointment</p>
<p>How many couples in this world unknowingly fall into a miserable hell due to a lack of hygiene! It is a fact that a husband with strong essence and vitality is usually in the dominant position in sexual relations. Although the wife hopes that her husband will always be by her side, she does not always enjoy "that" often. However, when she is at the peak of her passion, she hopes that her husband is strong, virile, and has endurance, so that they can spend their happy life in the harmony of love. This is also the creator's way of rewarding men for improving their health. If a man loses his health due to excessive indulgence and debauchery, he should bear full responsibility. Excessive indulgence and masturbation leading to spermatorrhea are most likely to deplete the reproductive gland fluid, which is the source of our life. Therefore, men who are depleted of essence and vitality are almost certain to suffer from neurasthenia, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, impotence, premature aging, and weak brain and kidney deficiency. At the same time, due to the deficiency and strong desire, it is also most likely to cause impulses in this long winter night, arousing his wife's passion, but often presenting a fleeting pleasure that cannot be satisfied. How can this not cause the wife's hatred? From hatred to the breakdown of feelings, many domestic tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and suicide occur!</p>
<p>If one does not conserve essence in winter, one will inevitably suffer from disease in spring. This is common knowledge that every man should know. In early winter, the weather is like a "little spring." Chrysanthemums and crabs are at their prime, so it is truly time to enjoy life, but one must not be excessive. Unless both husband and wife are filled with passion and have a need to relax their nerves, they should go to bed early and have adequate rest afterward. In short, it is acceptable to cultivate health with love, but it is definitely not appropriate if it damages health. If one already has the above symptoms due to early-year romance, one must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Essence). This preparation is made by scientifically replicating the endocrine essence extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs, so that the active ingredients are fully preserved. Therefore, this preparation is of high quality, has definite and rapid efficacy, and is unmatched by any similar preparations. After taking it, essence can be produced, kidneys can be nourished, the brain can be strengthened, and blood circulation can be activated within one day and night. It is especially valuable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish nerves, and eradicate various symptoms in a short period. Taking it for a winter will increase body weight and improve health day by day. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those suffering from spermatorrhea must also take the world-renowned "Ximitu's Jing Solidification Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, which will yield even faster results!</p>
<p>Patient Shen Jiqing, from Hang County, works in a certain bank. He suffered from spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation due to early marriage and accidental injury, as well as occasional forgetfulness and insomnia, which led to a freezing of affection between husband and wife, and difficulty in fulfilling his professional duties! Last month, he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After learning about his actual condition, I immediately instructed him to purchase two dozens of "Sheng Zhi Su" for men and five boxes of "Ximitu's Jing Solidification Pills" (actual price of two yuan per box) at the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company for combined use, and also administered electrotherapy and injections. After a month and a half, all his ailments have suddenly disappeared, his essence is strong and his strength is sufficient. Not only has the efficiency of his work increased, but the love between husband and wife is also as good as new!</p>

<h3>The Impact of Shriveled Breasts and Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>In today's era of progress and the omnipotence of science, not only can the defects that people previously thought were hopeless and regrettable for life—such as pockmarks, flat noses, slanted eyes, and cleft lips—be transformed into normal shapes with sophisticated equipment and skilled surgery. Now there is also a special remedy for a pair of breasts, which have been neglected but are even more important than pockmarks, flat noses, slanted eyes, and cleft lips, to make them stand tall. Pockmarks, flat noses, and slanted eyes are certainly unsightly on the outside, but they have little to do with health. However, if a woman's breasts are shriveled, the most precious and lovely curves of a woman cannot be formed. At the same time, it is even more important in terms of health, because a woman's breasts can stand tall entirely because of the active and healthy function of the ovaries. If ovarian function is destroyed by menstrual disorders, leucorrhea, malnutrition, multiple births, and weakness, the breasts will not develop well. Even those who have had good development will gradually shrivel and even become as flat as a man's. Such women should not even think about standing out in social circles. Even in ordinary families, to be honest: (1) it is inevitable that they will be disgusted by their husbands, leading to the misfortune of frequenting prostitutes and taking concubines. (2) Childbirth is difficult, and it is even more difficult to avoid the sigh of having no descendants! (3) Health and beauty are lost, and there are many illnesses and pains. (4) Due to the lack of offspring, even if there are millions of family assets, they can only be handed over to others. All of the above are facts that are commonly seen and heard by the general public, and are not the author's nonsense.</p>
<p>As for the remedial measures mentioned by the author, women only need to have strong confidence and go to the pharmacy to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Essence) for women, taking three tablets three times a day. After about four weeks of taking it, the appetite will definitely increase, the spirit will be refreshed, and the muscles will gradually become plump. Continue to take it for four or five weeks, the mind will be clear, the blood will be abundant, and the breasts will gradually rise. At this time, the effect is already extremely obvious, but this medicine has a peaceful nature and no side effects, so it should be taken continuously to ensure a rosy complexion, smooth muscles, and lasting youth.</p>
<h3>The Pathology and Treatment of Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>From childhood to adulthood, the reproductive function gradually matures, which is an omen of the youth's future and happiness! If one does not cherish oneself, or is blinded by curiosity and the temptation of a bad environment, and commits masturbation and homosexual love, or early marriage and indulgence, destroying the sexual nerves and loosening the sperm gate, spermatorrhea will inevitably break out. Therefore, those who suffer from spermatorrhea are almost certain to have neurasthenia. In this early winter, the weather is not yet cold, but they already have cold hands and feet and a listless spirit. If spermatorrhea is not treated for a long time, the sperm gate will become increasingly loose, and the frequency of leakage will gradually increase. Many young people suffer from terrible spermatorrhea and sperm leakage due to the lack of treatment for mild nocturnal emission. Semen is the source of our life. Continuing to lose a large amount of it will inevitably lead to essence depletion and blood depletion, and all kinds of diseases will arise, such as mental weakness, poor memory, dizziness, disturbed dreams and insomnia, sore back and aching waist, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, and incomplete development. Most of these young people are pale and thin, or outwardly strong but inwardly empty, and their energy is depleted. If they are students in school, their academic performance will inevitably fall behind others. Those who are engaged in business will feel that they cannot cope with the difficulties! At the same time, because of their unattractive appearance, they are often abandoned by the opposite sex and fall into a miserable state of unrequited love. Even in married life, it is difficult to have conjugal bliss, and all kinds of tragedies are constantly staged in the family! Or they age prematurely and die young!</p>
<p>The misery of spermatorrhea after neglect is well known. Therefore, early treatment is the best policy. The only way to treat it is to quickly take the holy medicine for treating spermatorrhea, "Ximitu's Jing Solidification Pills", to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, which will have the special effects of promoting sleep and stopping spermatorrhea that night. If you already have the above symptoms due to spermatorrhea and indulgence, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" made from strong animals to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use will further promote development, adjust metabolic function, and eradicate various symptoms in a short period. Taking it for a winter can increase body weight, prolong life, and promote longevity. If patients can come to this clinic in person to use electrotherapy and injections, we can guarantee a cure.</p>

<h3>Japan's War in China: Already in a Difficult Situation, Utterly Submissive to the Soviet Union and the United States, Still Hesitant About Ending the War - Important Remarks by Suma</h3>
<p>After the newly appointed Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Yakichiro Suma, arrived in Shanghai, he held a special press conference at the Broadway Mansions on the afternoon of the previous day, inviting foreign journalists to answer various questions raised. Suma first stated, "I have been away from the Far East for a long time, and my visit to China this time is to see and hear about the 'New Order in East Asia.'" In response to reporters' inquiries, he said, "Regarding the idea of how to resolve the Sino-Japanese war, the theory of dividing China's spheres of influence between the Soviet Union and Japan is the most ridiculous." When a reporter asked, "Then what is the best option?" he replied, "The best option is to implement the intentions of the statement made by former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on December 22, 1938."</p>
<p>Soviet-Japanese Pending Issues: Urgent Need for Resolution</p>
<p>When asked, "What efforts will Japan make to improve Soviet-Japanese relations and form a treaty of non-aggression between the two countries?" he replied, "There are no specific steps yet, so there are no preconditions for the Soviet Union and Japan to conclude a treaty." Regarding Soviet-Japanese relations, Suma said, "There are currently some outstanding issues between the two countries that need to be resolved. Tokyo believes that each issue should be resolved step by step, and finally the relations between the two countries can be adjusted." When a reporter asked, "In the current Soviet-Japanese negotiations, is the issue of Soviet aid to China one of the main points?" he replied, "The main outstanding issues in the negotiations are fishing rights, border issues, etc. The discussion of these issues and political disputes are not incorporated into the intentions of the Japanese government." When a reporter asked, "Many people believe that the Soviet government and the Third International are one and the same. Can Japan launch an anti-communist movement while simultaneously concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union?" Suma avoided answering directly, saying, "I did not say that Japan will conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Japan's policy has not changed."</p>
<p>How to End the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Although Suma said that the best way to resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict is to realize Konoe's statement, he failed to clearly state Japan's ultimate determination to withdraw its troops from China, saying, "This depends on future developments and circumstances." Regarding the "New Central Government," Suma said, "There are no accurate reports, as the official establishment date has not been determined. Although there have been news of dates from Tokyo, it is only based on individual perspectives. The reason for the delay in establishment is not due to insufficient preparation of affairs, or because it is not easy to establish, or because it has encountered some obstacles and become deadlocked. The Japanese government is still continuing its established policy to achieve its goals." When a reporter asked, "In your speech, the final withdrawal of Japanese troops from China depends on future developments. Does this mean that Wang Jingwei cannot guarantee to the Chinese people that he can achieve the withdrawal of Japanese troops?" Suma was speechless and only said, "Japan's policy is only based on Konoe's statement. As for what Mr. Wang does or what other parties do, it is none of our concern and should not be stated by Japanese officials." When a reporter asked, "Mr. Wang stated on November 12 of this year that he will seek absolute freedom and independence for China. If there is no way, then he will have to fight to the end. What is your opinion?" Suma considered this question and decided not to answer, saying, "I do not want to discuss any statements from the Chinese side at the moment, including Wang's claims." However, when asked whether "Tokyo is willing to negotiate directly with the National Government or through the mediation of a third country," Suma's answer was affirmative, saying, "There is no such intention at all." When a reporter asked, "Is Japan only supporting Wang Jingwei?" Suma replied, "Japan's support is not limited to any one person, but depends on the claims of their 'regime.' All claims that are in line with Japan's interests will receive broad support."</p>
<p>Japan Exhausted, Submissive to the United States</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to the issue of US-Japan relations. Suma stated, "I have just returned from the United States, so I feel that I know a lot about the United States. I feel that the US government and people, from top to bottom, have never hoped for a deterioration in US-Japan relations, so I believe that US-Japan relations will definitely improve. After returning to my country, this hope has increased even more, because I see that the Japanese government and the Japanese people are eagerly hoping to obtain the understanding of the United States. Although the 594 cases of US protests against Japan have not yet been resolved, Japan should strive to satisfy the United States and resolve them. However, Japan's use of troops in China has reached a very large degree. Under this situation, seeking to resolve the pending issues with the United States will naturally take time. However, Japan's efforts and goodwill will be seen one day." When a reporter asked, "Is it possible for a new US-Japan commercial treaty to be completed before January next year?" Suma admitted that the Japanese government is eager for the conclusion of a new commercial treaty, and said, "If the United States is unwilling to sign a new commercial treaty with Japan, the affected parties will not only be Japan, but the United States will also feel inconvenienced. The Americans should believe this." When a reporter asked, "Can the so-called 'New Order in East Asia' make the United States feel that it does not conflict with its government?" he replied, "American newspapers and magazines have expressed various opinions on this, but the American government and people may not all be die-hards who oppose the 'New Order.' "The US government has made it clear that it is not blind to the progress of the world, and since the entire world, including East Asia, is in turmoil, I believe that the United States does not want to run counter to the progress of the situation and remain in a stage of blindness."</p>
<h3>Admiral Heth to Visit Philippines Regularly</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," it was learned this morning (16th) that the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, will set sail for Manila on Tuesday. The ships of the Asiatic Fleet will, as usual, be moored off the coast of the Philippines for the winter. It is expected that the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, Admiral Heth, will travel south on the flagship. It is also reported that the US light cruiser USS Marblehead will arrive in Shanghai within two weeks and moor at the former US Navy pontoon off the Bund. The USS Augusta is expected to return to Chinese waters around next spring.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Western Zhejiang Suffer Defeat on Two Routes, Fierce Battles in Chang'an and Xiashi, Japanese Flee to Linghu and Qianjin Market, Shuanglin Recaptured</h3>
<p>Jinhua, 15th – On the evening of the 11th, Chinese troops attacked the Japanese troops stationed in Heshan and Shanlian, northeast of Deqing. On the morning of the 12th, they drove away the Japanese troops in Wuhe and Jing, and took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Shiwan. They continued to recapture Shuanglin. Also, Chongqing, 15th – Chinese troops in western Zhejiang adopted a comprehensive tactic, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese troops. Chinese troops in the Chongde, Wuxing, and Tongxiang areas, after encircling the Japanese troops from the night of the 9th, engaged in fierce battles in Lutou, northwest of Tongxiang, Wuzhen, Puxian, Tongxiang, Xinshi, northwest of Jiaxing, and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway in Chang'an and Xiashi. After being pressured by the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops fled in different directions. More than 40 Japanese troops, transported by civilian boats and motorboats, fled to Linghu (part of Wuxing). Another group of 50 Japanese troops, transported by motorboats and civilian boats from Xinshi, fled to Qianjin Market. The Chinese troops are pursuing them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Danyang Completely Annihilated, New Fourth Army Fights Fiercely Southwest of Danyang, Killing More Than 270 Japanese Soldiers, Japan Acknowledges Active Chinese Troops in the Lower Yangtze River</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with the new anti-Japanese situation after the great victory of the Chinese troops in northern Hunan, the New Fourth Army and the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, which are densely concentrated behind the Japanese troops along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, are constantly carrying out guerrilla tactics of ambushes and flank attacks. As a result, the scope of activities of the Japanese troops in the occupied areas has been shrinking day by day, and they are suffering greatly. According to visitors from Danyang, on the morning of the 8th of this month, more than 100 Japanese soldiers, carrying light military weapons, invaded Yanling Town (40 li southwest of Danyang) from Baoyan (27 li south of Danyang) with great fanfare.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting, Japanese Ultimately Encircled</p>
<p>After receiving intelligence reports, the X Battalion of the First Regiment and Commander Wang of the Second Regiment of the New Fourth Army personally led the X Battalion to make strict arrangements to gather the troops in Jiuli Town and Majia Village, west of Yanling, forming a strong encirclement. A fierce battle immediately broke out with the Japanese troops. The sound of gunfire and artillery shook dozens of li. Because the New Fourth Army received the assistance of the people, accurate intelligence, familiarity with and advantage of the terrain, and the destruction of transportation on roads around, the Japanese troops could not be reinforced in a continuous stream. In addition, with rich combat experience (the army has experienced more than 300 battles of all sizes), a clear understanding of the anti-Japanese war, and a hundredfold courage, everyone fought bravely, with one person acting as ten, and charged valiantly. Although the Japanese troops relied on sophisticated weapons, most of them were eventually annihilated.</p>
<p>Japanese Completely Annihilated in One Day and One Night</p>
<p>Subsequently, more than 200 Japanese soldiers from Danyang and Baitu Town came to reinforce. The X Battalion of the Second Regiment of the New Fourth Army also rushed to the scene, and a fierce battle, rarely seen in Jiangnan in the past two years, unfolded. The battle started on the morning of the 8th and lasted until the morning of the 9th, a total of 28 hours. As a result, all the Japanese troops were annihilated, with more than 270 killed, dozens wounded, six light and heavy machine guns captured, three grenade launchers, more than 160 rifles, three Japanese soldiers captured, and countless other military supplies. In this battle, the army also heroically sacrificed 50 or 60 people and wounded 40 or 50 people. This battle can be described as a remarkable feat of the army on the Jiangnan battlefield.</p>
<p>Fujita Acknowledges Active Chinese Troops</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources yesterday, Lieutenant General Fujita, the newly appointed commander of the Shanghai area, gave a speech to a group of foreign journalists on the 15th, acknowledging the activity of the Chinese troops, making it impossible to establish "security." Fujita said that the lower Yangtze River area is the most important place for politics, economy, and military affairs in central China, and the establishment of "security" there is the most urgent task. However, there are still regular Chinese troops and guerrilla units that launch attacks from time to time, disrupting "security." Therefore, the Japanese army intends to exert all its efforts to "eliminate" these troops in order to establish "security." However, the Chinese side firmly believes that this kind of attempt by the Japanese side will ultimately be futile.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on North Jiangxi Road Suddenly Intensify Inspection</h3>
<p>Those Blocked Numbered 70 to 80, The Exit Seems to Be More Relaxed.</p>
<p>At the two gaps on North Jiangxi Road, the intersection of Wenjian Shi Road and Haining Road, the Japanese troops guarding the posts suddenly paid special attention to pedestrians entering on the afternoon of yesterday. In addition to taking the passes and verifying the photos and ages one by one, they also observed whether the state and clothing were different or consistent. If the photos were not recent, or the clothing in the photos did not match what was worn, they were considered suspicious, and the passes were immediately torn up. As a result, as many as seventy or eighty pedestrians were blocked for no reason. The tension was unprecedented. However, the two gaps seemed to be more relaxed.</p>
<h3>British Residents in China Hold Fundraising Meeting</h3>
<p>British residents in China, after the outbreak of the European war, organized the "Central War Fundraising Association" and carried out fundraising separately to provide wartime funds. It is learned that the association will hold a meeting next Tuesday at the British Women's Association at No. 12 The Bund. Arnold will be the chairman of the meeting. At that time, Mr. Arnold will speak about the meaning of "Raising the Standard" in the radio broadcast of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. On the one hand, Mr. Arnold hopes to raise more donations and discuss recent events.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land in Beihai, Shanghai Ships Temporarily Do Not Call, Taikoo Jinan Wheel Sailed South Yesterday and Was Implemented, South China Route Encountered Another Major Blow</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, various shipping companies have opened up a new route for coastal defense in Guangzhou Bay. According to the prescribed route, the ships travel from Shanghai via Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay to Haiphong, and also call at Beihai Haikou. Yesterday, the city of Shanghai received news that Japanese troops landed on a small island in Beihai the day before yesterday (the 15th) at dawn. Therefore, calling at Beihai has been temporarily suspended. The Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel, which left the port at 1 pm yesterday, has implemented not calling at Beihai. Therefore, the South China route has suffered another blow.</p>
<h3>False Police Shoot at British Automobile, Foreigners Express Deep Resentment, British Consulate Will Protest to False Municipal Government, Number of False Police Who Fired Also Ascertained</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the British Consulate General will protest to "Mayor Chuan Xiaolan" regarding the fact that a British person was driving a car through the intersection of Difeng Road and Daxilu Road last night, and was allegedly shot at once by a policeman of the "Special Municipal Government" "on traffic duty" because he ignored the signal issued. The foreign community in the city is quite resentful of this shooting case. A large number of armed police officers on the road are already trying to seize the activities of the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession on the roads and sidewalks outside the concession. Now, driving to that area feels unsafe.</p>
<p>Name of British Person Not Yet Announced</p>
<p>The name of the British person has not been announced. He was driving a car along Difeng Road last night and drove past a policeman on the road wearing a black winter uniform. When the car passed the intersection, a shot was heard and the bullet flew past the car. The British person accelerated away. The shooter seemed to be standing on the sidewalk rather than the "police officer on traffic duty." Later, someone asked the police why he fired. He replied, "Because the person in the car saw the police signal and did not stop the car."</p>
<p>British Military Authorities Demand Explanation</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, a British person was driving a car from Difeng Road into Maggie Road yesterday (15th) night, and was shot at by a false policeman because he did not see the traffic signal from the "Special Municipal Government" police. The name of the British person was not disclosed last night. The Jing'an Temple Police Station did not receive any news about this matter, but the British military authorities have notified the "Special Municipal Government Police Bureau" to demand an explanation.</p>
<p>Did Not See Signal, Suddenly Heard Gunshot</p>
<p>The British person was driving south along Difeng Road from the north. Near Daxilu Road, he slowed down and continued to drive forward when a policeman from the "Special Municipal Government" did not make a traffic signal gesture. As soon as the car passed the intersection of Haig Road and entered Maggie Road, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and the bullet flew past the car, luckily missing. He continued to drive forward and reported to the British Military Headquarters.</p>
<p>British Consulate Protest to Be Filed Today</p>
<p>Last night's final news was that the British Consulate was waiting for a detailed report from the Bureau of Public Works regarding the shooting of British residents by false police the night before and could file a protest with the false mayor by this afternoon at the latest. It was also learned that the British military's question to the false police bureau had not been answered as of last night, but the British military had ascertained the number of the false police officer who fired the shot and had notified the false police bureau. The name of the British resident who was attacked will not be released to avoid accidents, but it is known that he is a member of the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3>Street Children Being Sheltered</h3>
<p>Many Are War Orphans</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is now making every effort to arrange for street children. According to the police department, in October, 34 vagrant children who lingered on the streets and children who specialized in opening car doors to solicit rewards were taken in by the police. Most of these children have been living on the streets for two years, sleeping in the open, which is very miserable. Most of them are orphaned children after the "August 13th" battle, alone and begging. The Municipal Council has already been aware of this, so it recently established a street children's shelter at No. 190 Ningbo Road to accommodate these orphaned beggars. There are now 50 beggars in the shelter. Therefore, the beggar children who used to be found opening car doors and soliciting rewards from passengers at various wharves and streets are no longer found now.</p>
<h3>Fujita Shows Inner Distress to Foreign Journalists, Unwilling to Offend Soviet Union and United States, Difficult to Say When Sino-Japanese War Will End</h3>
<p>—Opening Up the Interior Is Also Lip Service and Not Substantial—</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, Lieutenant General Fujita, commander of the Japanese army in the Shanghai area, stated at a reception for foreign journalists at his official residence in Jiangwan yesterday (15th) afternoon that the Japanese army would avoid meaningless conflicts with the Soviet Union as much as possible in order to contribute to world peace. He earnestly hoped that after a reasonable and understanding approach was achieved to resolve the long-standing issues between the United States and Japan, relations between the two countries would greatly improve. As for the revocation of restrictions on trade and travel in the interior by people of third countries, he could not give any definite guarantees. The issue of allowing unrestricted residence in Nanshi is currently under serious study by the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<p>Opening Up the Interior Is Hopeless</p>
<p>Fujita replied to a large number of written questions submitted by reporters in advance, expressing his opinion that the military equipment and other war materials supplied by Europe to Chongqing have certainly decreased due to the outbreak in Europe. Fujita also assured reporters that within the possible scope of military needs, restrictions on trade and travel in the interior by foreigners will be gradually eased. However, this easing must not hinder military operations. He could not say when the easing would be implemented, as this point depends on the deployment of the Japanese army and the situation in the enemy's camp.</p>
<p>Difficult to Predict Future of War Against China</p>
<p>When asked how extensive the activities of the guerrillas in the Yangtze River basin and near Nanjing were, Fujita replied that the Japanese troops occupying these areas had repeatedly contacted the guerrillas, but the guerrillas are now gradually ineffective. After the recruitment period, peace and order will be restored. Because there are wars on both sides, travelers are quite dangerous, so restrictions on travel and commerce in these areas are unavoidable. He could not say how long the Sino-Japanese war would last. Whether Japan has continued military objectives in China depends entirely on future circumstances.</p>
<p>Japanese in China Are of Uneven Quality</p>
<p>US-Japan relations have improved slightly. If both sides have a thorough discussion of the pending issues, he believes that the differences that still exist can be resolved, and the relations between the two countries can have a clearer atmosphere. Before Fujita got up, he also discussed various issues related to China and Japan with the reporters. He asked how many of the reporters present had lived in Japan, and then asked if, in their opinion, Japanese people were unpleasant people. One reporter replied that Japanese people in Japan were indeed like that, but many Japanese people in China were not. Fujita laughed when he heard this, saying that unfortunately, the Japanese people in China are of uneven quality.</p>
<h3>British East Surrey Regiment to Be Transferred to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Rumor That West Yorkshire Regiment Will Be Transferred Elsewhere, British Military Authorities Could Not Confirm</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that the British East Surrey Regiment stationed in Shanghai will be transferred to Tianjin to replace the shortage of the Douhan Light Tank Regiment, the British military authorities in this port said that this point "does not seem ripe yet." According to reports, a team of the East Surrey Regiment has been ordered to be transferred to Tianjin to protect overseas Chinese, which is indeed true. The order to transfer the East Surrey Regiment of the Shanghai British Army to Tianjin to protect British interests and withdraw the soldiers of the Douhan Light Tank Regiment was issued by London, the British capital. Since the Douhan Light Tank Regiment withdrew to Hong Kong, it seems somewhat inappropriate to leave a small number of troops in North China, so it is quite reasonable to transfer a team of the East Surrey Regiment to Tianjin. Moreover, since Britain participated in the war, any army, regardless of which army, must comply with the order and be transferred within a few hours of the order being received. It is possible for the troops to not meet each other for several months or even years. The rumor that the West Yorkshire Highland Regiment will also be transferred elsewhere soon, the British military authorities cannot yet confirm. It is heard that this measure by the British side, according to the explanation, is due to the outbreak of the European War, but China has concerns about Britain's Far East policy.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Songfu Celebrates His Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>Wang Rutang and Others Initiate Congratulations, Preparations Office Established in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuang Songfu from Fenghua has successively held important positions such as member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, and acting chairman of the Huai River Guidance Committee. He is frugal in his clothing and diet, and his enthusiasm and determination have made his political achievements remarkable. He is highly respected by people from both the government and the opposition. In recent years, he has retired to his hometown, focusing on farmland water conservancy. This year, December 26th is Mr. Zhuang's eightieth birthday. Mr. Wang Rutang, Chu Huiseng, Yu Feipeng, Chen Yihuai and other contemporary worthies believe that Mr. Zhuang is an elder with great virtue and has made contributions to the party and the country. In the past, when he was in his hometown, he destroyed his family for the sake of learning. In Shanghai, he presided over new learning associations, edited agricultural books, and organized large-scale forestry and animal husbandry companies in Yuhang and Lin'an to promote reclamation, achieving remarkable results. He has foresight and is diligent in his work, and can be a role model for future generations. Therefore, they established the Zhuang Birthday Preparations Office at the China Agricultural Bookstore on Jiaotong Road in this port, and widely solicited poems and articles to express congratulations and show appreciation.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Establishes Oil Collection Network for Tung Oil Purchases</h3>
<p>Province Divided into Three Regions, Oil Stations Established at Key Points</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's purchase of tung oil was previously contracted by the provincial government with the Central Trust Bureau, and the Oil Tea Cotton Silk Management Office was entrusted to undertake the work. The purchase started on October 11. In order to facilitate the sale of oil by farmers and merchants, a province-wide oil collection network has been established. Except for the counties in the war zone, the oil-producing areas in eastern Zhejiang are divided into three regions: Jinquyan, Ningshaotai, and Wenchu. Within each region, oil collection stations are established at key points according to the production and transportation conditions to directly purchase oil. For counties with a large amount of oil production but without oil collection stations, the oil collection stations entrust local banks, cooperative treasuries, trading shops, and cooperatives to purchase oil at appropriate locations. Counties without the above institutions may entrust registered and qualified oil dealers to purchase on their behalf. The price of oil is uniformly set at 50 yuan per market dan (100 catties). Oil-filled tin containers are subsidized at 1 yuan per market dan, for a total of 51 yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Government also promulgated a provisional outline of measures for the control and transportation of tung oil and ordered it to be followed.</p>

<h3>To Ship Goods to Malaya, Local Customs Must Be Registered, Restrictions on 34 Kinds of Goods Are a Controlled Policy, Non-Sterling Group Goods Must Be Approved</h3>
<p>Since the Malayan government promulgated measures to restrict the import of 34 kinds of goods this year, various domestic goods factories in this city, due to their failure to fully understand the reasons for this, have successively written to the Shanghai General Federation of Chinese Industries, requesting the association to inquire on their behalf. The association, considering that the matter concerned the entire issue of domestic goods, forwarded the letter to Mr. Gao Shiheng, the overseas domestic goods inspection representative, requesting him to investigate the matter clearly and reply to relieve the public's doubts. Now Mr. Gao has replied in a letter, saying that after the Malayan government announced the restriction on the import of 34 kinds of goods, its purpose was to control foreign exchange and prevent the flight of funds. Any country outside the Sterling Group that wants to import these 34 kinds of goods must first request registration with the local customs. Only after approval can the goods be allowed to be imported. At present, these application procedures are not difficult, but just require one more procedure. Importers here have pre-processed these procedures for goods shipped from Shanghai before importing them. As for future changes, it is difficult to predict. All countries are now paying attention to control work, and regardless of the import and export of foreign exchange and goods, they are building barriers. We should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Lun Chang Factory Authorities Make Final Efforts</h3>
<p>Labor Negotiations Interrupted Again</p>
<p>Factory Still Plans to Find a Solution</p>
<p>More than 2,800 workers in the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Pudong, which is owned by British merchants, have been on strike for half a year since being instigated. Last week, the negotiations between the two sides were very close, and the factory had repaired and refurbished the internal buildings and machinery, and also transported in a large amount of raw materials to facilitate resumption of work. Unexpectedly, the recent negotiations have been interrupted again. Although it is not a complete break, there is no progress and it has fallen into a standstill. The reason is that a certain party needs to recover several times the 100,000 yuan relief funds and various publicity expenses spent on the workers during this half year strike from the factory. This is the focus of the suspension of negotiations. It is heard that the factory plans to make a final effort to resolve the six-month strike in order to help the workers, whose lives have become more difficult with the arrival of this winter, and to avoid both sides suffering huge losses again.</p>
<h3>Readjustment of Shipping on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line; Shorter Voyage</h3>
<p>Loading Cargo Between Shanghai and Shipu</p>
<p>Carrying Passengers Between Shanghai and Zhenhai</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of shortening the shipping route and voyage of the Shanghai-Ningbo line, although it was previously planned that the Fook Line would be the first to try a method where passengers going to Ningbo from Shanghai would be transferred, and cargo would not be transferred temporarily. The ship would then carry passengers back to Shanghai and then a second time to Zhenhai, which would save unnecessary time waiting to unload cargo outside the port, and provide more convenience for passengers traveling back and forth. However, this plan was ultimately opposed by other shipping companies and could not be realized.</p>
<p>The Hanna Line Only Carries Passengers Between Shanghai and Zhenhai</p>
<p>Recently, the Hanna Line has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to call at Shipu on the way to Zhenhai. According to the shipping company's plan, cargo will be loaded between Shanghai and Shipu, and passengers will be carried between Shanghai and Zhenhai. Since loading and unloading cargo at Shipu does not require waiting time, and passengers can be unloaded at Zhenhai as soon as they arrive, the voyage can definitely be shortened, and the number of trips can also be increased. If the ship implements the above plan, other ships will also follow suit. At that time, the round trip journey is expected to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Resolution of Disputes at Loading and Unloading Docks</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, disputes and even fights have occurred between Ningbo junk (sailboat) loading and unloading workers and dock workers over the right to load and unload cargo from the Fook and De Ping ships, which has affected the unloading work of these ships. It is now known that the dispute has been resolved satisfactorily after a meeting convened by the Yin County government with all relevant parties.</p>
<h3>French Postal Administration Prohibits the Import of Trade Parcels</h3>

<h3>Mr. Yu Qiaqing Talks About the Truth of Coal Briquette Price Drop</h3>
<p>Da Mao Coal Briquette Factory is Purely Operated by Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>The Purpose is to Stabilize Market Prices for the Benefit of the Common People</p>
<p>Regarding the recent drop in coal briquette prices in this city, Mr. Yu Qiaqing told a Daguan News Agency reporter yesterday that coal briquettes are an important fuel for residents of this city, and are particularly closely related to the interests of the lower and middle classes. A few months ago, coal prices soared. Anthracite coal is used by factories and ships, and white coal is needed by middle and upper class families to ward off the cold, so the impact is relatively light. However, coal briquettes are a necessity of daily life and have the same nature as rice. The price increase to four yuan and five jiao per dan (equivalent to ten yuan per ton) has become unbearable for the people. He consulted with coal merchant Mr. Zhang and others to set up a factory. The factory is located at the original site of the Jardine Matheson sugar godown in Pudong. Moreover, it is well known to people in the coal industry that the white coal dust used to make coal briquettes is not a Japanese product. Furthermore, the raw materials used by the factory are entirely shipped from French Annam to Shanghai, which is also a fact. After the factory was established, prices immediately dropped, reducing the burden on ordinary people. The current market price of coal briquettes has been stabilized at sixty-three yuan per ton and three yuan and five jiao per dan, which greatly benefits the livelihood of the common people. The rumor that the products of the Da Mao factory are Japanese coal briquettes is likely due to jealousy from competitors. This report aims to clarify the truth and distinguish between right and wrong.</p>
<h3>Owner of Garden Villa at Avenue Joffre Sues for Eviction; Owner Appeals to the High Court, Retrial Yesterday</h3>
<p>A large garden villa at 1877 Avenue Joffre is the property of Tao Huayu Fang, the wife of Tao Jiayao, the former governor of Jiangxi Province, the former head of the National Water Conservancy, and the current chairman of the China Funeral Home, who is from Jiangxi. The Tao family used to live there. During the August 13th Incident, the entire Tao family moved to 6 Lane 753 Haig Road. After the war broke out, the property was entrusted to the Tong An Company for rent. In October of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Central Mint rented the house from the Tong An Company to use as an office location at a monthly rent of four hundred yuan. At that time, both parties</p>
<p>Signed a lease agreement</p>
<p>But stipulated that the shortest period was three months. Around October of last year, Mrs. Tao sold the villa to a Westerner named Qiaoqi (transliteration), and at the same time terminated the lease with the Central Mint, ordering them to move out. Because the Central Mint refused to move out, the Tao family could not hand over the house to Qiaoqi according to the sales contract, so the Tao family compensated Qiaoqi one thousand five hundred yuan and cancelled the house sale contract. The lease</p>
<p>Term expired</p>
<p>The landlord, Accountant Dali, refused to continue the lease. The Tao family urgently needed to move, and again ordered the Central Mint to move out so that they could take back the house for their own residence. As a result, due to the Central Mint's opposition, in April of this year, Tao Huayu Fang, the wife of Tao Jiayao, the owner of the villa, came forward and appointed lawyers Li Guozhen and Li Yujun to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division against Tan Songtao, the legal representative of the Central Mint.</p>
<p>Seeking eviction</p>
<p>And compensation for damages of one thousand five hundred yuan. Judge Dong Zi Guan opened the court for trial. The defendant, Tan Songtao from the Central Mint, was represented by lawyer Ma Shouhua. The defendant argued that they had rented the house from the Tong An Company, and the subject of the lawsuit was inconsistent. The plaintiff first sold the house and then wanted to take it back for their own residence, so the objectives were inconsistent, opposing the eviction. The plaintiff's</p>
<p>House sale dispute</p>
<p>Resulted in compensation of one thousand five hundred yuan for breach of contract, which the defendant should not be responsible for. The three-month lease term stipulated in the contract had already passed, so the lease was indefinite. The defendant should have the benefit of the lease, and the plaintiff's request for eviction was unreasonable. As a result, the first instance judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim. Tao Huayu Fang was not satisfied and appealed to the Civil Division of the Third High Court. The result was rejected. She then appealed to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court for a third trial. The Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has now reviewed the entire case file and ruled that the portion of the appeal concerning compensation for damages is rejected, and the appeal for the eviction portion is remanded to the Third High Court</p>
<p>For retrial</p>
<p>The Third High Court received the judgment and case file. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xia Jinde, accompanied by Judge Tong, opened the court for trial. Both the appellant and the appellee were represented by lawyers. Both sides made their arguments, each with sufficient reasons. The court then questioned the appellant Tao Huayu Fang in detail about whether she was the spouse of Tao Jiayao, and announced that they would</p>
<p>Set a date for witnesses and continue the debate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Forbids Foreigners From Hunting in the Suburbs, Saying it is Easy to be Mistaken for Guerrilla Attacks</h3>
<p>Foreigners carrying hunting rifles and hunting in the suburbs of Shanghai have recently been strictly prohibited by the Japanese military. The notification issued by the Japanese military authorities was released at yesterday's press briefing. It was stated that Japanese sentries in the suburbs of Shanghai had repeatedly heard the sound of gunfire and mistakenly believed that guerrillas were attacking, issuing false alarms. For this reason, the Japanese military authorities will not be responsible for any accidents caused by third-country nationals carrying guns and hunting in the suburbs of Shanghai in the future.</p>
<h3>Major Robbery Case at Xiangtai Lumber Company; All the Robbers Apprehended; Pre-hired Truck Robbed a Large Amount of Lead Ingots; Stolen Goods and Truck Discovered; Car Owner, Driver, and Robbers Arrested Together</h3>
<p>At approximately 9 PM on the night of the 9th of this month, more than ten robbers, each armed with guns, broke into the Xiangtai Lumber Company at 15 May-Beig Road one after another, bound and monitored the watchman Zhou Caisheng and other employees. They then began to search and rob the employees, stealing 695 yuan in cash and obtaining various keys from Zhou Caisheng. They then followed a</p>
<p>Prearranged plan</p>
<p>And opened the side door of the Xiangtai Lumber Company on Jing'an Temple Road. A truck drove in and loaded fifty-four lead ingots (each weighing two hundred pounds), worth seven thousand five hundred and sixty-seven yuan, onto the truck and sped away. When the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau received the report, they immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. However, the robbers had already escaped. The police believed that the robbery was premeditated and dared to pre-hire a truck</p>
<p>To commit robbery in broad daylight, so they conducted a detailed investigation. According to Hua constable number 2928, who was stationed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Huo Road to direct traffic, he had seen a truck cross the road. Because trucks are not allowed to drive on Jing'an Temple Road according to regulations, he paid attention and saw that the license plate number was 23155. However, because there was nothing in the truck, he did not stop it. The police then used this information to determine that the truck belonged to the Da Hua Transportation Company at 41 Fujian Road.</p>
<p>Ordered detectives to investigate</p>
<p>According to people in the company, the truck was out on a mission, so there were no results. Until 10 AM on the 15th, Xin Zha Public Security Bureau Hua detective leader Ding Huaguo, detectives Li Yinmin, Chen Jinsheng, Ma Derong, Yang Feizhang, etc., learned that the gang of robbers were hiding in room 7 of the Wuzhou Hotel at 517 Lane 5, Ma Road. They then cooperated with foreign detective Shala and secretly went to the address, successively arresting Jiang Yuting (also known as Da Mugua), Ma Fugen, Zhang Xinzao (also known as Shazi), Mu Jinbao, Fan Zhenglong, Shen Goulang, Ding Xiaowuzi, Xu Abao, Xu Wende, Chen Zilong, Li Zhongxin, Yang Ruihe, Zhu Yongxiang, Chuan Liangyi, Jiang Yigui, and a woman named Jiang Zhao, a total of sixteen people. They confessed that</p>
<p>The robbery that night</p>
<p>Was carried out with a truck from the Da Hua Transportation Company, driven by driver Lu Asi. The stolen lead ingots were sold to the Tong Feng Xiang store at 630 Beijing Road and the Yong Tai Chang second-hand store at 825 Beijing Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives then went to Da Hua and arrested the owner, Wei Wenzhong. They then apprehended the driver, Lu Asi, on Edward Road, along with the truck with license plate number 2355, and brought them all to the Public Security Bureau. They also went to the Tong Feng Xiang and Yong Tai Chang second-hand stores and recovered a total of fifty-two lead ingots. They also confiscated from Jiang Yuting's home at 28 East Zilaihuo Street</p>
<p>A sales receipt</p>
<p>For the sale of fifty-four lead ingots and brought it to the Public Security Bureau. They were all detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Public Security Bureau lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case and requested permission for a postponement. Lawyer Fan Gang Yu Enliang defended Mu Jinbao. After Judge Xiao interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained for a postponed hearing next Saturday.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Gold Bars on the British Yong Sheng Steamer; Value 140,000 to 150,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At 4 PM on the 14th, when the British Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng steamer set sail for Hong Kong, the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department searched the ship and discovered a large number of gold bars, worth 150,000 yuan. A total of forty gold bars were found by customs officers in the restroom.</p>
<h3>Raid on Drug Den on Route Cardinal Mercier</h3>
<p>The French Concession police raided a drug den at 33 Dongxin Lane 111 Route Cardinal Mercier at 3 PM the day before yesterday, arresting forty-six men and women who were smoking drugs, including Lu Changxin, Cai Shaoying, Lu Jinbiao, Wang Asan, Zhang Yusan, Yuan Tianyi, Xu Jincai, Zhu Afu, and Li Shuideng. They confiscated more than forty small packets of morphine and more than fifty smoking pipes. However, the main criminal was at large. The arrested individuals were taken to the Public Security Bureau and yesterday were sent to the Second Special Court for questioning. The court approved a postponement for a retrial. The defendants were detained. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest the fugitive mastermind.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Young Girls</h3>
<p>Car Driver Recognized the Truth</p>
<p>Car Drove into the Police Station</p>
<p>Jiang Fulin, a native of Changzhou, who specializes in kidnapping women, kidnapped two female workers, Shi Sunshi (20 years old, resident of 5 Qianxingfang, Binlang Road) and Zheng Lishi (19 years old), in front of the Shenxin Textile Factory at 4 PM on the 12th of this month and hid them in the home of his accomplice, Mei Yaozong, at 3872 Daxuli, Ma-bai Road. The next day, they led them to the Zhonghua Hotel on Xujiahui Road and locked them in a room for illicit purposes. At 10:30 PM on the 15th, the two kidnappers Jiang and Mei called a rental car from the Zhongshan Automobile Company on Father Jin Road and tricked the two victims into getting into the car, intending to take a boat from Yichang Road Bridge to Changzhou to sell them. Fortunately, the rental car driver Mao Guisheng recognized the truth and, without saying a word, drove the car into the Putuo Road Police Station to report. After an investigation by Hua detective Chen Xianrong, the defendant Jiang Fulin confessed to the kidnapping and sale of the victims. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the defendants to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted them for crimes such as interfering with family harmony. Judge Liu Yugui concluded the trial and ordered them to be detained pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Missing Rental Car Driver Case; Police Conduct Strict Investigation; Notified Water Police to Assist in the Search; Bullets Have Been Examined, No Record Found</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, a rental car with a missing driver was discovered on Race Course Road, Longmen Road. There were bloodstains on the driver's seat cushion, and two bullets were found in the car. It was clear that the driver had been killed. The Concession Police Department is making every effort to search for the driver's body.</p>
<p>So far, no body has been found. Yesterday, it was learned that the police have asked the Water Police to assist in the search, fearing that the driver's body may have been sunk in the Huangpu River. According to the police's speculation, the rental car was hired for criminal activity. After the illegal act was completed, the criminals realized that the driver knew too much and took the extreme measure of silencing him. This can be inferred from the bloodstains on the driver's seat, the bullets in the car, and the driver's disappearance. It was also learned that the bullet inspection experts at the Public Security Bureau, upon</p>
<p>Examination results, the bullets found in the car had no previous record. The rental car belongs to the Japanese-owned Xinxing Automobile Company at 170 Wusong Road, Hongkou. At 5:30 PM on the 13th, the company received a phone call to rent a car. Driver Zhao Shanxing (20 years old) drove to the south of Suzhou Creek. However, the car was not returned after a long wait, so the company notified the police. After a search, the mysterious empty car was discovered the next morning on Race Course Road, Longmen Road.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse Discovered on Xinji Bang Road, Hongkou</h3>
<p>At approximately 9 AM yesterday, someone passing near Xinji Bang, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, saw a female corpse on a vacant lot and immediately reported it to the local police station. Detective number one was dispatched to investigate and sent the female corpse to the Tongren Hospital. An examination revealed that the female corpse was in her twenties. The right temple had a knife wound with a very deep gash, and the brain matter had spilled out. The left arm bone was broken. It appeared she had been murdered. She was wearing a black qipao, a beige undershirt, white cotton trousers, yellow silk stockings, and gray shoes. After an examination by the doctor, the corpse was transferred to the morgue for further examination.</p>
<h3>Owner of Le'an Fang, Avenue Joffre, Shows Consideration for Tenants</h3>
<p>The houses in Le'an Fang on Avenue Joffre are managed by the British-owned Taylor &amp; Riley. In February of this year, Taylor &amp; Riley notified all tenants that the rent would be increased by 30%. The tenants strongly refused, arguing that this was an extraordinary period and that they had all come to seek refuge and could not afford such an increase. Later, Taylor &amp; Riley voluntarily reduced the increase to 10%, but the tenants still refused to accept and deposited the rent due in court, which was approved, leading to a stalemate until now. The day before yesterday, Taylor &amp; Riley suddenly had a change of heart and withdrew the rent from the court, canceling the rent increase. The tenants were so grateful for Taylor &amp; Riley's consideration that they sent a letter of thanks. The rent increase dispute, which had lasted for a year, thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Carelessness at the Tongxing Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>The Tongxing Cotton Mill at 1433 Yichang Road, Gordon Road, Shanghai West, was suddenly engulfed in flames at approximately 7 PM last night. Thick smoke billowed everywhere, and the fire was raging. The fire brigade rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and tried their best to put out the fire. The fire was finally extinguished in two hours. As a result, dozens of bales of cotton were burned, and the loss was minor.</p>

<h3>Lin Fengmian's Personal Art Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>At the Aurora University Auditorium</p>
<p>Lin Fengmian, the former principal of the Hangzhou Art Academy, moved with the entire faculty and students to Guixi, Jiangxi, after the outbreak of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line war. Later, they moved to Yuanling, Hunan. Last year, he resigned from his position and stayed in the countryside of Hunan, dedicating himself to painting. He came to Shanghai this spring and held a personal art exhibition at the French General Association in May, which was well received by the Western press. At that time, most of the visitors were foreigners in this port, and a large number of works were sold. Art circles in this port felt that many Chinese did not have the opportunity to see the exhibition, so they consulted with Mr. Lin and arranged for him to hold another art exhibition at the Aurora University Auditorium on Luba Road for four days, from today to the 20th. The works on display are richer than the last time, totaling approximately 200 pieces, all created during the Anti-Japanese War. Among them, dozens of pieces are based on scenery and folk life from various parts of Hunan, and some are stage scenes depicted by Lin when watching Chinese old dramas, which are full of humor. Lin's works are purely Chinese paintings, and the tools he uses, such as paper, brushes, and pigments, are the same as those used by previous Chinese painters. However, his style and format are mostly unique and completely break away from the stereotypes of traditional Chinese painting. His brushstrokes are simple and vigorous, and his coloring is sparse and clear. The picture is not complicated, but the charm is naturally revealed, which is quite similar to the so-called Impressionist Western paintings. This work has revolutionary significance in the development of Chinese painting art. The exhibition is open from 10 AM to 7 PM, and tickets cost 2 yuan.</p>

<h3>YMCA Sponsors Student Service Society: Used Books and Stationery Can Be Consigned, 10% Commission Deducted Upon Sale</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>In today's era of rising prices and increasingly difficult living standards, students from families with even slightly better financial situations understand the hardship their parents face in raising tuition fees. When it comes to all the necessary stationery and books needed in school, they can practice frugality to show consideration for their parents. At the same time, the Shanghai Christian Men's and Women's YMCA has recognized this need, so they recently established a Student Service Society.</p>
<p>The Student Service Society is located at 999 Jing'an Temple Road, in the Women's YMCA. The day before yesterday afternoon, to learn about the situation of this service society, I made a special visit. It was in a row of bungalows to the left of the Women's YMCA building, together with the Household Goods Exchange, occupying only a corner of the room. On a long table were dozens of used books, and there was also a bookshelf, which was also full of used books.</p>
<p>At another small writing desk sat a staff member, engrossed in writing. I explained my purpose and chatted with him for a while. It is said that the reason why the Men's and Women's YMCA decided to establish this Student Service Society is to promote thrift, practice conserving material resources, trade books and supplies, and serve students throughout the city. The scope of service includes students' daily books, stationery, and all daily necessities, except for impractical, broken, or damaged items, which are not eligible for service.</p>
<p>If students from various schools have used books, stationery, or daily necessities that are no longer suitable for use but are not damaged, they can directly deliver them to the Student Service Society for display and sale. The price can be set by the owner of the goods, but the service society has the right to re-evaluate the price with the consent of the owner. Once the consigned items are sold, the service society will issue a notice at the end of the month, and the owner can go to collect the proceeds of the sale. The service society will deduct 10% of the price as a handling fee. If the owner can contribute more as a donation, that is especially welcome. This handling fee, after deducting office expenses, will be entirely donated to the Shanghai Christian Men's and Women's YMCA Relief Society as student relief funds.</p>
<p>The length of time for which items are consigned will be determined by the service society. If the consigned items cannot be sold or have been consigned for too long, they will notify the owner, who can retrieve them with the receipt issued upon delivery. If the owner still wants to continue consigning, they must re-register. If the owner does not retrieve the goods after the deadline after receiving the notice, the service society has the right to freely mark them down and auction them off, but the proceeds from the auction, after deducting 20% as a handling fee, will still belong to the owner.</p>
<p>Consignment of goods is not limited to students. Manufacturers who want to entrust the Student Service Society to sell their goods are also welcome. However, there are other methods for them, and the above-mentioned provisions do not apply. Currently, the Student Service Society is in its initial stage and is making every effort to promote the society's affairs and is starting to solicit students from various schools to join in cooperation. If possible, in the future, sales outlets may be set up in schools with large student populations, and the methods will be exactly the same as those of a retail department. Indeed, amidst rising prices, the prices of books and stationery have also repeatedly increased. Many parents cannot afford the burden of their children not attending school, and the YMCA's establishment of this service society is also a need of the times, because while it directly enables students to conserve material resources, it indirectly reduces the burden on parents. It is hoped that all young students in Shanghai will join in cooperation so that the Student Service Society can achieve results that exceed expectations in the future.</p>
<h3>China's Aircraft Manufacturing Plant</h3>
<p>— Jin Ji</p>
<p>According to an American expert who is about to fly from Chongqing, speaking to a Chinese reporter in Hong Kong: Somewhere in southwestern China, there is now an aircraft manufacturing plant built by the Chinese government itself, with more than two thousand technicians and a capital of two million. This plant was entirely established by the Chinese government as part of its plan to develop aviation.</p>
<p>Many hardworking young Chinese technicians, under the guidance of fifteen American aircraft manufacturing experts, are constantly working diligently in the factory. In order to avoid becoming a target for air raids, the constructed factory buildings are all hidden in dense forests and have good air defense facilities. In 1933, the factory was roughly outlined in Hangzhou. By 1934, it was able to manufacture aircraft and supply them to the government.</p>
<p>When the war broke out, the factory was close to the front line and was the first to be attacked by air, but the losses were reported to be small. The factory then began to move to Nanjing and then to Hankou. Finally, 180 transport vehicles were used to carry everything from Hankou to the southwest. Although the factory technicians and staff experienced several scares and difficulties, they were still enthusiastic about their work and showed no resentment.</p>
<p>The factory is now located in the countryside, far from large cities, but general transportation is still convenient. If it needs to be moved again, it will not be difficult. The expert also said that the factory's equipment is no less inferior to that of current American aircraft factories. We estimate that the total construction cost of the factory buildings would be about 700,000 yuan. If a similar aircraft factory were to be built in the United States, it would cost at least US$2.5 million. In addition, there are 21 small dormitories specially designed and constructed for American technicians and a clinic with 81 beds.</p>
<p>Because it concerns military secrets, it is not possible to announce how many products the factory has recently produced, but generally speaking, the results must be good, which is foreseeable. The population near the factory is not very large, only about three thousand five, but the output of materials that can be supplied to the factory is considerable. In the past eight months, the expert has flown between the United States and the area 27 times.</p>

<h3>Be Careful of Fire</h3>
<p>— Dong Er</p>
<p>"Fire! Fire!" Striking headlines are published on the social news pages, with terrible records of people jumping from buildings and becoming disabled, or even more tragically, being buried in the fire. Winter is the season most prone to fires. People go to bed early because of the cold and ignore the smallest spark. Heating with stoves causes a prairie fire. Especially now, when there are too many people in too little space, how many families are crammed into each residence? One wing is rented out to three households; half a floor is divided into two families. As a result, front, back, left, and right are almost all worlds of coal stoves. And the boundaries are all old, thin pine boards, which have been smoked by coal stoves for a long time. Once a fire starts, it is truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>"Be careful of fire! Be careful!" At the same time, we hear such shouts in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>Being a night watchman in Shanghai is just a humble job of asking each household for some tips at the end of the month. However, in the dead of night, when everyone is dreaming sweet dreams in a warm bed, they brave the wind and cold, circling through every dark alley, touching every household's back door, knocking on the clapper, and shouting, "Be careful of fire," serving for the safety of people's lives and property. We must thank them for this arduous work.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we wake up from a dream in the middle of the night and hear the shout "Be careful of fire," we should check whether there is a risk of fire around us. Moreover, waking up in the middle of the night is also a time for introspection. The sound of the clapper is a warning of a fire in one's conscience, because the "isolated island" is a place to "be careful of fire!"</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Learning Fieldwork in a New Realm for Reporters, Studying Domestic Affairs in a Small Practice Field at School</p>
<p>This small travel agency at Soochow University has an employee stationed there by the China Travel Service. Because the school has more than 5,000 people, personnel matters are inevitably complicated, so a trust service society was organized. There are many kinds of services, including a small bank, a small store, a small printing press, etc., and there is also a small travel agency. Although there is only one employee in this small travel agency, he is very busy. Because although most of the students at Soochow University are from Jiangsu, there are also many people from other provinces. Especially from Zhejiang Province, and the next most are from Anhui Province. Even people from Sichuan and Guangdong Provinces are coming and going every day, either teachers and students returning to their hometowns, or large groups of students traveling out. Even elementary school students who are sent to study in Europe and the United States can be handled by this travel agency attached to the school. In addition, today is Saturday, which is considered the busiest day. Some people want to take the Beijing-Shanghai Railway home to visit their families, some want to return to eastern and western Zhejiang via the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road, and even those who are not far from Suzhou and take a small motorboat or long-distance bus for only one or two stops entrust this travel agency to handle it, and the travel agency can handle it properly for you. Originally, if you want to travel somewhere, how many people there are, and where the destination is, just make a phone call to the travel agency, and the travel agency will prepare the tickets for you, or send someone to deliver them to you, or you can pick them up yourself. Fortunately, this travel agency is just outside the dormitory, attached to the trust service society, occupying only a small room. You have to pass in front of it every day when you go to school. When the time comes, the travel agency will make a phone call to the train station, bus station, or small steamer wharf, telling them how many tickets have been sold and asking them to reserve that many seats, which is also very convenient. As for the small bank in the trust service society, it is truly small but complete. There is a savings department, a remittance department, a custody department, and a current account department. With such an organization, it is very convenient. Initially, for example, at the beginning of the spring and autumn semesters, when students pay their tuition, they also pay it to this small bank. Students who bring extra money can also deposit it in this bank. Also, if there are any payments of money, you can open a current account, and they will give you a small checkbook. When you want to pay for something, you fill out a small check, and people will also believe you. Because at that time, no one was willing to write a bad check. As long as you write a bad check once, you will lose your lifelong credit, especially in school, where everyone is young! (203)</p>

<h3>A Kirin School Grand Assembly: Dedicated to the Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>On September 1st, I wrote an article in this publication entitled "Suggestions to the Disaster Relief Authorities to Hold a Kirin School Grand Assembly." Now I hear that this ideal will become a reality. The Refugee Relief Association has tentatively scheduled to hold charity performances for the refugees at the Renxin Theater from the 28th to the 30th of this month for three days. The last day will be based on my suggestion to hold a Kirin School Grand Assembly, but their proposed "Kirin School Grand Assembly" is a joint performance by Zhou Xinfang (麒麟童, aka The Kirin Child) and his disciples, and does not include all Kirin School laosheng (old male role) performers. Therefore, in terms of the playbill, what I proposed earlier will not be suitable for this charity performance. Now, based on the actors they have tentatively decided on, I will re-draft the playbill as follows:</p>
<p>Li Ruchun (Jie Zitui): Burning Mianshan Mountain</p>
<p>Yu Zongying (Ma Chao), Wang Fuying (Zhang Fei): Two Generals</p>
<p>Yang Baotong (Xu Ce): Xu Ce Runs the City</p>
<p>Gao Baisui (Guan Yu)</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang (Wei Yan), Chen Hefeng (Huang Zhong): Battle of Changsha</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou (Gao Chong): Picking the Hua Che</p>
<p>Li Ruchun (Xiang Bo)</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng (Zhang Liang), Zhou Xinfang (Fan Zeng), Gao Baisui (Xiang Yu), Yang Bintong (Liu Bang), Wang Fuying (Fan Kuai): Hongmen Banquet</p>
<p>The actors in the above playbill are all played by Zhou Xinfang and his disciples. Each person almost plays two plays. In terms of the plays, they are all individual masterpieces. Zhou Xinfang's "Battle of Changsha" is now as popular as "Chasing Han Xin," and his portrayal of Wei Yan is even more unique. This play will surely attract audiences. The finale, "Hongmen Banquet," brings together Kirin School disciples, which can be described as an unprecedented creation. Zhou Xinfang has repeatedly wanted to play Fan Zeng, and this time his wish has come true. In the play "Hongmen Banquet," Fan Zeng occupies a very important position. The personality of this person is difficult to depict, and only Zhou Xinfang can play it successfully. Chen Hefeng is best at playing xiaosheng (young male role) plays, and playing Zhang Liang is just right. Others such as Gao Baisui's Xiang Yu and Wang Fuying's Fan Kuai are known for their superb skills, so this play is a perfect match. If it can be performed, it will surely be a sensation. However, the above playbill can only be performed for 250 minutes, because the actors are limited to Kirin School members, so it is impossible to lengthen it. In my humble opinion, it would be better to invite Kirin School laosheng performers who are not listed in the Kirin School, such as Wang Chunbai and Xu Hongpei, to participate together, which will not only strengthen the lineup but also make the playbill more exciting. In terms of time, adding one or two plays can be performed for more than six hours, which is a perfect plan. I wonder what the gentlemen of the Refugee Relief Association think?</p>
<h3>Zheng Mengxia Remarries a Leather Shoe Merchant</h3>
<p>— Cui Ping</p>
<p>Zheng Mengxia, a "Southern and Northern Tones" female performer, co-starred in Peking Opera with Zhao Ruquan in Shanghai several years ago. Later, she went to sea as a dancer and finally starred in the detective film "New Marriage Massacre" at Yihua Film Company. Zheng is naturally intelligent and exceptionally perceptive. She has made special progress and can also sing Peking Opera on stage. After studying Peking Opera for two years, she was able to perform on stage; after studying English for less than two years, she could converse with English people; after going to Singapore for a few months, she spoke fluent Singaporean dialect. Her talent can be seen. She was previously married to Chen Gaocong, and their love was extremely strong after marriage. Chen unfortunately died of illness in Hong Kong last autumn. When Chen was seriously ill, Zheng served him day and night, personally serving him medicine and mortgaging things to pay for medical treatment, without letting Chen know. However, Chen eventually died. Zheng was forced by livelihood to go to sea as a dancer and also appeared on the screen. Recently, she has remarried a wealthy leather shoe merchant in Hong Kong. On the day of the wedding, Hu Die personally went to congratulate her.</p>
<p>Zheng's previous husband, Chen Gaocong, was a famous dancer. Several years ago, Shanghai RCA Radio Company held a Shanghai-wide dance competition (to promote the company's new radios). The winning couple would receive the company's latest model radio and be invited to Hollywood at the company's expense. At that time, because there were no restrictions on the qualifications of the participants, all the dancers in Shanghai participated. The most competitive were Li Li from Beiping, who had just returned from the United States, and the Liang sisters, who are now dancers in Singapore. As a result, the winning couple was Zheng Mengxia and Chen Gaocong. At that time, the names of Zheng Mengxia and Chen Gaocong were widely publicized in Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai. Li Li, who was full of champion ambition, was relegated to second place, which is truly a good story.</p>
<h3>Entertainment News</h3>
<p>— Yuan You</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Touring Troupe organized by artists Jin Shan, Dai Zonghao, Zhu Lian, etc. in Guilin has been directly under the Guangxi Provincial Government Education Department since October of this year. The provincial government subsidizes it with 2,000 yuan of national currency per month. The troupe will now tour and perform anti-Japanese dramas in various war zones near the province for a long time.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's second new work after "Orphan Island Paradise," "Like a Dream, Not a Dream," will be filmed in mid-October. The play is based on "The Runaway Nurse," written by the great British writer Hugh Walpole, and tells the story of the life of the heroic woman Holman Lee during the Great War of 1914.</p>
<p>Ms. Lan Ping, who was once rumored to have married Communist leader Mao Zedong, has now officially joined the Chongqing China Film Studio and is said to be performing in the film "Young Pioneers" directed by Sun Yu.</p>
<p>Bai Yang is suffering from a severe cold in Chongqing. According to her personal account, the cause of the illness was the fright she suffered during the last enemy air raid on Chongqing.</p>
<p>The military service propaganda film "Good Husband," directed by Shi Dongshan, has been completed and is scheduled to premiere in Xindu on the anniversary of the Premier's birthday. It is said that the film has been ordered to be screened in cities across the country to promote military service.</p>
<p>The American "World Technical Corps," which tours the world, is hosted by Miss Kelley, a famous female strongwoman from the United States weighing 360 pounds. She arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The authorities of the Xindu Theater in this city specially welcomed her and persuaded her to hold special performances at the Xindu for several days starting today. Miss Kelley became internationally famous ten years ago for surviving being run over by a 2,000-pound car and having iron hammered on her stomach with an 800-pound anvil. This time in Shanghai, she will surely refresh the ears and eyes of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>A Meeting with Tang Huaiqiu</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu has come to Shanghai. On the night of his arrival in Shanghai, he went to the Xuan Palace Theater to watch his daughter Ruoqing's "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." When I first discovered him, even we old friends who met every day during the Carlton period almost didn't recognize him. He was wearing dark glasses and had a thick mustache. After only a year apart, this "young father" had actually aged.</p>
<p>That day, because he didn't want to miss this sensational "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," after shaking hands, we agreed to talk again the next day and then separated.</p>
<p>The next day, Tang Huaiqiu, who was standing in front of me backstage at Xuan Palace, had regained his youthful and talkative appearance from two years ago. I pretended to point at his mustache, and he grabbed my hand and whispered in my ear as if he were acting:</p>
<p>"My old man doesn't have a beard yet, and the son is keeping this..." He touched his bare upper and lower lips, "It seems a little embarrassing, right?" Although he pretended to be whispering, his voice was still very loud, and the actors in the dressing room couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Tang Ruoqing was just putting on makeup. He turned around and looked at his father and smiled at the mirror. He said to me:</p>
<p>"I was reminded of something. A few days ago, there was a 'Nanguo Entertainment Scene' in your newspaper that said that Ruoying and I were at odds with our father. In fact, the incident at 'China Travel' in Hong Kong was very complicated, and the outside world cannot understand the surface reasons. But I have one sentence I can say, which is that the blame should not be entirely placed on my father. This time my sister came to Shanghai to study, and because I have been away from Shanghai for two years, I also wanted to take this opportunity to come and have some fun, which caused the outside world to say that Ruoying and I were at odds with our father. Now that Dad is back, that is the factual answer."</p>
<p>At that moment, several old friends were urging Tang Huaiqiu to also guest-star in a play at Xuan Palace, but the old actor used a diversion tactic and began to tell a story.</p>
<p>We had heard that story several times in the Carlton building. As soon as we heard his opening remarks, we knew that once his talk box was opened, there would be no stopping. The lights in the theater had already dimmed, and Huaiqiu took the opportunity to say, "Oh dear, I don't have time to put on makeup!"</p>
<h3>Leisurely Painting the Entertainment World (21) Yunnan Opera</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>Yunnan Opera is a unique local opera in Yunnan and is similar to Peking Opera in appearance.</p>
<p>Various local operas can be seen in Shanghai; only Yunnan Opera has not yet had a "chance to meet" the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The scripts, scenes, and performances are all the same as Peking Opera, only the pronunciation, dialogue, and clown's interludes maintain the "Yunnan scenery."</p>
<p>In addition, the use of a tanggu drum for rhythm in each play is also unique to Yunnan Opera.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Old Actors Rely on Skill to Make a Living, New Performers Rely on Building the Crowd to Make Money</p>
<p>The first day's opening play, "Wang Baochuan," sold out completely. The grand scenes of the second and third days were not much diminished. The people who came to listen to the opera, because they saw in the golden advertisement the news that Wang Yaoqing, the old court musician, was "personally supervising the scene," so all those who sat in the lower arena (connoisseurs who watched the opera liked to find seats in front of the lower arena door) invariably craned their necks before Yurong was about to appear on stage, looking straight into the upper arena door. Sure enough, they saw an old man wearing dark glasses, extending two fingers towards the musicians and drummers on stage, using hand signals to make a greeting. Thus, Yurong stepped onto the stage amid thunderous applause. According to the rules of opera performance in the past, there was no such thing as a private huqin. Famous actors among the court musicians, such as Gui Fen, Tan Xinpei, and Sun Juxian, etc., such famous figures, never used exclusive musicians and drummers. Among those famous actors, there were only Mei Yutian and Sun Zuochen who played the huqin. As for when each person was about to go on stage, they always extended two or three fingers towards the stage, which was an indication to the person playing the instrument to use the flute to tune the strings to the correct palace tune or B character tune. Only Gui Fen's voice was the best, and the tune was particularly high. Every time he appeared on stage, he simply flicked his sleeves, implying that no matter what three limits you set, I don't care if you want me to sing the upper word tune. However, at that time, it was very common to be able to sing the B character tune. Like Old Tan, who could only eat the tune to the correct palace, he was still ridiculed at the time as being softly decadent. As for those who sang the six-character tune, they simply had no qualifications to perform on stage. (143)</p>
