<p>社評</p>
<h3>西班牙的悲劇及其敎訓</h3>
<p>西班牙當眞演出了一慕悲劇。這慕悲劇，不是在於巴薩隆納的失守，不是在於義德法西斯加緊的進攻，也不是在於英法的承認弗朗哥。西班牙最大的悲劇，乃是三月六日的瑪德里政變，使西班牙政府內部力量，起了很大的分化。在這次政變中，堅决領導抗戰的奈格林被迫去了職；新組的國防委員會向弗朗哥伸出了求和之手；兩年餘來共患難的戰友紛紛被逐了出去；過去有着光榮戰鬥聲名的米亞伽，也竟充了政變的主角。他們雖然說着為求「光榮的和平」，然而在征服者的前面，「光榮的和平」是永遠沒有的。在征服者的前面，有的只是「無條件的投降」。事實上，今天西班牙縱然已處於窮蹙的境地，但它卻仍有繼續抗戰的基礎。它至今依然擁有全國四分之一的中部區域；它有七百餘萬忠誠的人民；它有五十幾萬英勇精銳的軍隊。因此，西班牙政府只要决心堅定，只要內部團結，它是儘足憑這些基礎跟其敵人相周旋，而且事情是「大有可為」的。可是加薩陀之流，於抗戰最艱苦緊急的關頭，在與叛軍互通欵曲之下，竟逼走了奈格林，而主張與弗朗哥進行議和，這結果顯然只有削弱自己內部的力量，予敵人以進攻的機會，這實在是全世界每一個愛護西班牙的人所引為最痛心的悲劇。</p>
<p>加薩陀之流雖然向弗朗哥提出了議和的要求，可是弗朗哥的回答怎樣呢？弗朗哥說：「我們决不因瑪德里新事變而改變原來的立塲，仍當準備軍事行動。…除非政府軍願無條件投降，國民軍决不停止進攻瑪德里！」（八日海通電）如果無條件投降可以說是「光榮的和平，」那麼、三十個月的艱苦奮鬥豈非多事？一百餘萬人民和戰士的血豈非白流？因此，國防委員會求和呼籲發出以後，立刻引起了西班牙人民的反對，共產黨首先發動，連日瑪德里正在混戰中。老實說，三十個月殘酷的戰鬥經騐，已給每個西班牙人民注射進「恨」的血液。他們憤恨法西斯，他們决不甘心被征服。「卽使暫時壓了下去，六個月後仍將爆發內戰」（美國「民族周刋」語）。</p>
<p>這次瑪德里政變，主要原因顯是由於加薩陀等對於抗戰的動搖。他們的目光如豆。他們看到了抗戰前途的艱苦，不知道進一步的與友黨加緊團結以應付大敵，而反想出賣友黨以求敵人的寬恕。他們聽到敵人喊着「反共」，就眞的以為只要「反共」，就可以達到「光榮的和平」。殊不知道在今天斥最忠於抗戰的戰友，就等於在敵人前面自斬手足啊！</p>
<p>自然、這次政變的成功，奈格林總理未能於事前防範，也應當負責任的。當巴薩隆納失陷之後，奈格林曾經跑到法國逗留了幾天，使政變者得有佈置的機會。在這裏，我們不禁又想到武漢的陷落之後蔣委員長急忙趕回重慶的事情，要是當時蔣委員長不趕回重慶，說不定汪兆銘也會在重慶有所動作，這卻又是蔣委員長見解過人處事周密的偉大地方了。</p>
<p>其次，從這次政變中，我們也可以明白看出英法的態度。據六日哈瓦斯的電訉說：「西班牙奈格林內閣之傾覆，早在此間外交界人士意料之中。」巴黎迴聲報也說：「加薩陀曾派代表前來法國與西班牙辭職總統，法國政府，及英國大使館代表等有所接洽」。倫敦「泰晤士報」更明顯的說：「米亞伽之出組內閣，是為進行和平之步驟。…少數人向多數人投降，並不能視為不榮譽的行為。」從上面幾點看來，英法對於這次政變的關係，可不言而喻了。</p>
<p>西班牙悲劇的發生，也許又會引起一般對於中國抗戰認識不足的人們的懐疑，以為西班牙的悲劇，也許會可能在中國重演。這種「杞人憂天」的觀察，顯是由於認不淸中國和西班牙所具條件不同的緣故。因此，我們不妨在這裏加以簡略的解釋：第一，西班牙抗戰和中國抗戰雖然同為反法西斯侵略的戰爭，但它們却有着形式上的不同。西班牙是以「內戰」的姿態爆發，而中國抗戰却是全民族對外的戰爭。因此，支持西班牙抗戰的人民陣綫的基礎，顯得不及中國民族統一戰綫基礎的廣大。在西班牙，代表貴族，地主和大資本家利益的「西班牙長槍會」，「西班牙復興會」和西班牙右派各黨聯盟（C.E.D.A.）等，幾乎都附着於弗郎哥的旗幟下；中國的民族統一戰綫，則除了漢奸以外，包括着從資本家到工人的所有的人民。而且，在西班牙，黨派是萬分複雜的。一部份無政府黨員至今還跟着托派，寧，毛林等領導下的「馬克斯統一黨」（P.O.U.M.）反對政府抗戰的國策；中國的民族統一戰綫則在國共兩黨精誠合作之下，已强固得如同磐石，而且還在不斷加强着。再具體一些說，西班牙有擁着武力的弗郎哥，而中國至多只有像「潮濕爆竹」一樣的汪兆銘，連話都說不響的。</p>
<p>第二，西班牙和中國的國際環境是不同的。西班牙的雙手自始就被「不干涉」繩索反縛着，中國的國際援助却只有一天天增加。這是因為英法在歐洲方面處境困難，生恐捲入漩渦，寗願犧牲西班牙。而且，在遠東方面還雄踞着「西伯利亞之熊」和「大棍子」主義的羅斯福，使得英法知道要維護遠東利益。只有援助中國。</p>
<p>第三，西班牙的領土面積壓根兒就不能和中國相比，西班牙面積一九六，六○七方哩，中國領土面積二·九○三·四七五方哩，相差幾乎十一倍（見World　Almanac　L939)。中國的地大物博，是持久戰的基礎，這一點,自然要比西班牙有利得多。</p>
<p>上面幾點說明着中國所具的條件，任何方面都比西班牙有利。西班牙的悲劇絕不至於在中國重演的。</p>
<p>但是，西班牙悲劇的教訓，却値得抗戰中的中國深切記取和體騐：</p>
<p>第一，不斷鞏固團結是持久抗戰的要務。要鞏固團結，就必須隨時注意抗戰陣營中妥協動搖份子的存在、並淸除一切妥協動搖的言論。</p>
<p>第二，堅持獨立自主外交，也是爭取最後勝利的要務。爭取外援是必要的，但必須保持獨立自主的精神。吾則，跟着人家跑，像西班牙國防委員會這樣經不起第三者的播弄，就軟起膝骨來，正是一個很好的警告。在今天，中國的國際形勢是一天天好轉了，英法美等都給中國以援助，要知道這完全是中國不屈不撓抗戰的結果。但如果我們就此倚賴外援，以為有外援就可什麼都不管的等候勝利，那就錯了。外援是中國堅决抗戰爭取來的，最後勝利也只能由中國自己努力去爭取。</p>

<h3>蘇聯軍民合一　决全力保衛疆土　張鼓峰事件殷鑒不遠　内務部長警吿侵略國</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯共產黨全國代表大會、昨日午後繼續開會、內務人民委員長貝利亞當即發表演說、稱道蘇聯兵力之强盛、其言有云、「史丹林所推行之和平政策、與法西斯主義各國資產階級各國政府所推行之政策、逈不相同、蘇聯共產黨與各民族在史丹林領導之下、節節獲勝、殊堪自豪、彼帝國主義各國所抱之野心、業由吾國予以揭發、其計劃亦已宣吿失敗、影響所及、資本主義各國之統治階級對於蘇聯、莫不切齒痛恨、一言以蔽之、蘇聯敵人之挑釁舉動、已遭遇蘇聯之强大實力而為之斂跡、吾國紅軍與艦隊以及光榮之空軍、乃至吾國之情報機關刻正嚴密保衛社會主義的祖國、張鼓峯事件之教訓、不特為外國將官所記取、即反共產國際集團所屬之各侵略國、亦必永誌勿忘。史丹林會指示吾人、必須以一切方法、充實國家力量、吾人對於此層、决不須臾怠忽、而當務之急、厥在繼續肅淸一切隱匿之敵人、并以意志堅定之份子、加强國家機構、至以吾國之情報機關而論、原係列寗所創辦、史丹林更從而發揚光大之、共所負任務極為重要、吾人茲當正吿一切敵人、偉大的蘇聯决非他人所能觸犯、吾國英勇的陸軍、不特所向無敵、抑且日見增强、吾國之人民與軍隊實已合而為一、成為持久的不可分的力量、任何敵人凡敢侵犯蘇聯民族之幸福自由、進攻蘇聯神聖的邊界者、吾人即當以此種力量、一舉而殲滅之云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>馬奴斯基演說　抨擊法西國家　英國政策適足鼓勵侵略　世界勞工亟須加强陣線</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯共產黨等十八屆大會、本日賡續開會、當即由共產國際俄羅斯組主任馬奴斯基發表長篇演說、內容共分三段、第一段報吿各國共產黨現狀、第二段抨擊各法西斯主義國家、第三段批評英法兩國、尤其是英國所推行之妥協政策、其結論有云、各國勞工組成統一陣綫、暨加强各國人民陣綫、仍為共產國際之兩大口號、茲將演詞全文、摘要錄次、</p>
<h3>勞工界有力武器</h3>
<p>馬奴斯基首關各國勞工、尤其是法國勞工、務常努力勸導態度猶豫之農民與小資產階級、吿以各民治國當局推行一慕尼黑政策結果、徒使各該國淪於附庸地位、亟應加入人民陣錢、予以反抗、「彼主張向各獨裁國屈服者、多係各法西斯主義國工作人員、若輩往往混跡於勞工運動中、標榜和平主義、藉以矇蔽羣衆、」須知作戰之事、德國尙未準備就緒、各民治國倘能出以堅决態度、施以經濟壓力、必能使法西斯各國知難而退、「各國勞工欲使各民治國幡然變計、當在物質上以壓力加諸資產階級的政府當局、語其武器、則為罷工示威與民衆運動、」</p>
<h3>共産國際之近况</h3>
<p>以各國共產主義運動而論、數年以來顯已進步、共產國際會員遍於全世界、各資本主義國家其數不下一·二○○·○○○人、加以靑年團團員七四六·○○○人、總數共為二·○○○·○○○人左右、以視五年之前、已增加一倍有餘、其中法國共產黨黨員人數、已自四○·○○○人增至二七○·○○○人、該國共產黨機關報每日銷數、不下四七○·○○○份、美國共產黨黨員人數、已自二○·○○○人增至九○·○○○人、所可惜者、農村方面尙未能獲有顯著之進展、英國共產黨黨員人數、已目六·○○○人增至一八·○○○人、德國共產黨處於國社黨專政之下、其領袖雖多陷身囹圄、仍能保持原來之組織、而在羣衆方面、從事活動、其精神之堅毅、殊可欽佩、獨有義國共產黨迄今未能組成强有力之團體、</p>
<h3>所負使命之重大</h3>
<p>冉就共產黨之使命而論、第一必須為奧地利·蘇台德·台灣·朝鮮·阿比西尼亞各民族、要求自决權、第二、必須為中國與西班牙兩國、解除法西斯主義者之侵峪、同時對於法西斯各國藉口民族自决權利以干涉其他各國之自由獨立與主權之所為、尤須加以揭發、各法西斯推行政策時、輙以民族主義為標榜、例如德國之對於薩爾區域蘇台德區域乃至對於但澤自由市、類皆如此、某某國共產黨黨員、對於此種虛偽詐騙手段、不能儘量加以抨擊、殊屬可惜、為今之計、各國共產黨必須一方面為被壓迫之弱小民族爭取目决權、一方面為各殖民地土著民族、要求改善待遇、就後者而論、「各法西斯國之以鼓動戰爭為事者、方利用殖民地民族之怨恨心理、以遂其掠奪之私」、此種危機自應愼加防範、例如法西斯各國之工作人員、正在英法兩國殖民地內從事種種活動、其在巴勒斯坦地方鼓動叛亂一也、其在印度組織半軍事性質的「國民義勇隊」二也、其在南菲洲組織武裝的法西斯主義衝鋒隊三也、其以金錢與軍械供給阿拉伯族各酋長四也、以上各種煽動羣衆手段、亟應加以反抗、</p>
<h3>侵略與防御有別</h3>
<p>總之、世界上合法的正當的戰爭、與不正當的征略戰爭、必須加以區別、前者乃以反抗侵略、解放勞工、解放殖民地民衆為目標、後者則以奴化其他國家與其他民族為事、不可一槪論也、</p>
<h3>英無異自掘墳墓</h3>
<p>至是、馬奴斯基乃抨擊英國政策、略謂、英國希圖移轉德國視綫、而促其向東方擴展勢力、以謀不利於蘇聯、殊不知英國此種反動的資產階級政策、正與匪徒之行為相彷、無異自掘墳墓、例如該國暗中支持日本侵略、不管將目身檳諸遠東以外、此其一、該國向義國法西斯主義讓步、實與放棄其在地中海所處地位無異、此其二、該國以款項貸予　各法西斯主義　侵略國、等於增加各法西斯國之軍事力量、而預先註定本國自身之失敗、此其三、該國進攻蘇聯之計畫、若果見之事實、不僅足以促成法西斯主義之崩潰、且可招致整個資本主義之　瓦解、此其四、</p>
<h3>西新政權難持久</h3>
<p>至以英法兩國對於西班牙所推行政策而論、尤非吾人所能苟同、緣各該國之承認國民軍政府為合法政府、即自秘密干涉一變而為公開干涉、抑知反動各國决難摧淺西班牙民族、「過去在君主時代、該國廢王亞方朔十三世暨故獨裁者里維拉將軍、雖以壓制人民為事、均未能持久、即其明證、今有人焉、以德國大砲轟炸西班牙村鎭、以義國炸彈殘殺西班牙婦孺、身染西班牙人血跡、而為西班牙民族所詛咒、（指西國國民軍總司令弗朗哥將軍而言）、又安能望其久握政權哉」云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯經濟　基礎鞏固　工農生産量激增　反動派已全肅淸</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯共黨中執員會秘書安特萊夫繼馬奴斯基發表演說、贊揚史丹林政績、「略謂黨國在艱難困苦中、達於勝利之境、胥為史丹林領導之功、社會主義在蘇聯境內、匪特把握勝算、抑且樹有切實基礎」、自一九二九年以來、蘇聯工業生產數量已增加五倍、第一屆五年計劃且在預定期限之前、宣吿完成、所有間諜與叛黨份子均已次第肅淸、「外國敵人因此大失所望、而不復能對蘇聯作戰、蓋以蘇聯防禦力量日見强大、彼不知進退之鄰國、曾向吾國邊界進犯者業已嘗試紅軍之威力而獲有教訓、」以一般經濟而論、各業專門工人人數均已增加、技師與技術工人增加之數不下一·二二五·○○○人、去年一年間、畢業於各專門學校之技師亦有二八四·○○○人　其在農村方面、管理引曳車與收割機之司機人數、亦復增加一·一○○·○○○人、總計全國工人之已加入工會者共有四·七○○·○○○人、而共產黨靑年服務團團員三·○○○·○○○人尙不在內、「資本主義各國輒謂吾國淸黨結果、國力已見削弱、其實吾國地位之鞏固與穩定、遠逾往昔、則以吾國已山忠於列寗主義史丹林主義之人加以領導故也、就農業而論、敵人欲在蘇聯國內釀成飢荒、幷挑撥農民反對集體農塲、結果反為全國人民所反對、其陰謀卒不獲售、」觀於全國集體農塲之收益、已在五年之中增加三倍、全國之打麥機與收割機數目已增加七倍、可見農業改革計畫　實已獲有莫大成就、惟東南部若干區域　旱魃為災尙須加以補救耳、「按之史丹林所擬定之計畫、穀物收成應在三四年之內　提主高至八·○○○·○○○·○○○蒲什爾、此項計畫實不難見諸事實、」至是、安特萊夫乃下一結論云、「蘇聯民族現在以鮑爾希維克主義為中心、而團結一致　此乃從來未有之現象、列寗之事業已由史丹林繼承之、吾蘇聯民族在史丹林領導之下、儘可勇往直前、而絕不畏懼任何阻力」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日蘇邊防軍　又起衝突</h3>
<p>（哈爾濱）卟口在滿洲東邊界氣芬　附近地方、又發生蘇日哨兵衝突事件、雙方鋻戰約一小時久、據日文消息、是役雙方參戰人數、共有一百五十餘人日軍受傷者四人、在過去一星期中、蘇日哨兵衝突共有三次以此次為最大（十三日快訊社）</p>
<h3>史丹林報吿書　（再續）</h3>
<p>「即以日本為例、在日本進攻華北之前、英法諸大報紙　皆廣事宣傳中國之軟弱、不堪一戰、以日本之軍力能於兩三月內征服中國、於是英美政治家乃旁觀坐待其發展、及日本已對華作戰後、彼等所憑其佔領在　華外國資本中心之上海、聽其佔領華南英國獨佔勢力之中心之廣州、聽其佔據海南、包圍香港、此與鼓勵侵略何異、此無異彼等聲明、「請努力戰爭、我等將視其將來如何、」</p>
<p>「再以德國為例、雖以彼等負對奧保護之責、而彼聽其奪取　奧大利、彼等放棄蘇台德區聽憑捷克自生自滅、因此彼等放棄其所負一切責任、於時彼等又在報紙上造謠、宣傳俄國軍隊之軟弱、」「俄國空軍已頹敗、」蘇聯之暴動、鼓促德軍東向、允許該國以不勞而獲之利益、促其前進、」「請即對布爾塞維克進行戰爭、則一切必進行順利、」此一切與鼓勵戰爭、鼓勵侵略「無異、」</p>

<p>「歐美政治家及新聞界旣不見德軍開入蘇維埃烏克蘭、乃急不可耐而自行暴露其不干涉政策之背景、彼等公開書於紙　上謂德國不東進而向蘇聯、反而西向而要求殖民地、乃使彼等大失所望、</p>

<p>「蘇聯外交政策明確而易解、第一、吾人主張和平、並與其他國家維持事務性質之關係、若其他國家亦與吾人維持同樣關係、不侵犯吾國利益、則吾人之態度始終不變、第二、對於與蘇聯共有邊界之鄰國、吾人與之維持友誼關係、若此種國家　與吾人維持同樣關係、不直接　接侵犯蘇聯邊境；妨礙邊境之完整與安全、吾人態度將始終不變、第三、對於受侵略為自身之獨立而鬥爭的國家、吾人與以援助、」第四、吾人不畏侵　略者之恫喝、戰爭鼓動者、若圖破壞蘇聯疆界、彼施吾人一拳、吾人當報以三拳、</p>

<p>關於蘇聯國內情形、史丹林　述及國內全面的進步、包括經濟生活·文化發展·以及政治權力的强固、</p>
<p>經濟發展方面最顯著之　成績、在於採用近代技術完成工業農業的建設、吾國工廠中已不冉有陳舊之技術、農塲中亦不再有舊腐器具、即有、亦僅少數、」史丹林稱、就生產技術與工農業應用新技術之程度言之、蘇聯比較任何其他國家均為進步、因此等國家中舊機器之應用、仍妨礙生產與近代技術之應用也、</p>
<p>在社會政治方面、蘇聯已完全消除榨取階級、使工人農民及智識份子均加入工人前錢、加强蘇聯社會之道德與政治的統一、</p>
<p>鞏固蘇聯諸邦之友誼聯系、國內政治生活完全民主化、而新憲法亦已完成、此為本期最大之成績、</p>
<p>史丹林結論說、「這一切的結果、使國內局勢完全安定、政府鞏固、或為全世界所艷羨、」蘇聯工業之發展、不僅表現　於生產之增加、且表現於社會　主義生產之發展、私人生產之毀滅、總的工業出產已由一九三三之四二·○三○·百萬盧布）一九二六－一九二七價格）增至一九三八之一○○·三七　五百萬盧布、增加一三八·八、社會主義工業生產由一九三三之四二·○○二百萬盧布、增至一九三八之一○○。三四九百萬盧布、增百分之一三八·九、私人工業生產由一九三三之二八百萬减至一九三八之二六百萬、</p>
<p>社會主義工業在工業生產總數中佔百分之九九·九七、私人工業僅百分之○·○三、私人工業之消減、本非偶然、乃因第一、社會主義經濟制度高於資本主義制度、第二、社會主義性質制度、能於數年中供給社會　主義工業以具達到最新的技術水準、由生產技術觀點及工　業應用近代機器之程度而言、蘇聯為世界第一、蘇聯之工業發展巳超過中要資本主義國家、較之大戰前蘇聯工業生產增加九倍、而主要資本主義國家　僅超過百分之二十或三十、</p>
<p>史丹林嗣間、「吾人在何處為落後之現象乎、誠然、吾國每人工業生產之全量仍屬落後、一國工業之經濟力不顧其國之人口量、而僅以其生產之總量為定、但以其國每一人民之工業品消費量與其工業生產量相比較而定、」　（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　金價易漲難跌　昨又軋漲十八元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、起落靡常、情勢依然動盪不定、初因外滙漲勢步緊、且證券幫進多出少、故早間即抬高至二千一百元、嗣因某外銀行多頭獲利蜂擁出籠、且本地客幫亦託錢兌業跟蹤猛售、致市價曾一度退達二千〇八十元低盤、卒以外滙續趨緊軟、因之證券幫復來吸購、加以某錢兌業亦搜購頗力、故遂急轉上騰、終則猛漲十八元、各方人心平中略帶恍惚、交易尚旺、約八百餘兩、銀樓飾金亦飄忽不定、結果則掛大一元、海關金暨中英鈍金等依然呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤起落靡常</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因外滙逐步趨緊故售者多呈觀望態度、致價遂由二千零九十元喊高至二千一百元方見做開、首由證券幫賣予銀樓幫六十兩、二千一百元爲開盤價、較上週六做高廿元、開後未久、證券幫即原價後進銀樓幫及金號各五十兩、此後某銀號突代外商銀行獲利傾吐、致遂下挫、售予錢兌業及現金號各五十兩價均九十八元、又賣予銀樓幫五十兩、價九十七元、繼之某錢兌業亦代本地幫吐售、賣予同業五十兩、價九十四元、此後外滙緊勢益厲、故進者愈稀、價遂傾跌、售予證券幫五十兩爲八十元、其時因證券幫趁低復來吸購、復向上漲、證券幫進某錢兌業五十兩爲八十五元、金號進銀號五十兩八十九元、俄頃銀樓幫亦進錢兌業五十兩爲九十元零五角、後錢兌業互做五十兩、九十元爲午收價、午後交易轉寂、惟因外滙受洋行扒結下、續趨軟化、故亦隨之步高、首由錢兌業互做五十兩、價九十元、後銀樓幫售予錢兌業五十兩爲九十四元、逾半小時後又見某錢兌業進同業五十兩、九十七元、繼之又進現金號五十兩、九十八元、時已四點許、此後仍想照上價吸購、奈售者難找、致未做開、故晚收仍爲二千零九十八元、結果較上週六軋漲十八元、全天廿元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百十元、收進二千零九十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金飄忽無定</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初均未更、迨至九時五十五分、因烚赤晨開漲勢堅昂、故亦掛大一元、後至十時半、因烚赤突轉疲軟、故亦回跌二元、十一時五十五分因烚赤復趨上漲、故亦掛大一元、午後四時十五分因烚赤繼續高昂、故亦再掛大一元、結果軋漲一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百十三元、新同行爲二百十一元、收進二百零五元、</p>
<p>純金未有變動</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價初屬一千二百十元零三角、掛牌海關金亦仍呆定、爲二元三角九分二厘、上海標準金價亦未更動、仍計一千二百零五元六角、乃十一日倫敦電、英純金未起變動、每盎斯仍爲七鎊八先令三辦士所致云、</p>
<h3>外匯有粉麥結款　絲廠平津幫亦在結進致英美匯價緊勢加厲</h3>
<p>滙市昨「華北聯銀」雖突來拋塞、惟外銀行吃胃頗健、故爲狀殊平、嗣後因粉麥結款紛紜、兼平津投機商及絲商等猛烈扒結、且油洋行美孚亦頻吸期貨美匯、加以外商銀行供意淡薄、致形勢遂逐步緊縮、交易頗旺、港滙因洋行吸購亦力、故狀況亦趨鬆動、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期回縮〇六二五、遠期勿動、紐約銀價亦無升降、倫敦生金依然未更、滙兌英對美如舊、對法小三生丁、對滬平平、美對英亦平、對法小〇六二五、對滬未更、中央掛牌各匯呆定如故、銀行晨開賣價、英滙八辦士三四三七五、美滙十六元三一二五、較上週六英美兩匯、均無榮辱、開後雖「華北聯銀」突來猛塞、但以外行如匯豐等納胃亦健、致鮮變化、有利賣予滙豐英滙八辦士三七五、兼又售予外銀行美滙十六元三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅小五厘、計徵百分之八·〇〇、此後油洋行美孚驟興扒風、力吸遠期美匯、結進大通某行三月份美匯十六元二五、繼之又購結某行五月份美滙十六元〇六二五、後本市紗廠亦跟踪扒結、加以平津投機家亦爭前力扒、故潛勢頓見緊軟、絲廠與平津投機家相繼扒進麥加利有利某行英滙八辦士三一二五、兼美匯十六元二五、近午外銀行外塞予洋行港匯五十六元、爲狀亦軟、迨午收銀行賣價英匯八辦士二八一二五、美滙十六元一八七五、</p>
<p>後市因粉麥結款紛紜、且各外銀行賣意仍淡、故潛勢續告步緊、首由洋行結進匯豐麥加利英匯八辦士二八一二五、繼之又扒結某行美匯十六元一五六二五、最後洋行亦猛扒港滙、且外商銀行供意轉淡、故爲狀愈軟、洋行購結華行廣東港匯五十五元半、迨晚收銀行賣價英滙八辦士二六五六二五、美匯十六元一五六二五、結果較上週末、英緊〇七八一二五、美緊一五六二五、港滙亦貴六二五、</p>
<p>香港天津對英美匯價及對滬匯兌行市、自本日起將昨日所得電訊、列於市價攔內、讀者注意、</p>
<h3>貼現重出　五十元關</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率驟轉高昂、每千元升至五十元大關口、晨初即高至四十九元外、後即步升至午刻爲五十元、下午一度高達五十元零五角、最後五十元、計軋漲一元七角五分云、</p>
<h3>外幣上升甚勁</h3>
<p>上週六英純金及英美滙兌懼無更動、昨日本埠外滙洋行結款甚旺、銀行供給未暢、市價逐步緊張、勢甚軟弱、烚赤開盤穩定、嗣滙票報緊、金號錢兌業等奮勇扒納、人心堅强、散戶供給稀少、籌碼有限、外幣殷富復起搜購英美金鎊、猛升三五角、其他美金票香港票需要稍殷公會交易未盛、勤泰出永泰進美金票五百元、又出祥康進香港票二百元、承泰出祥康進香港票二百元、勤泰出永豐進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊升三角、英金票升二角一分、美金鎊升五角、美金票升四分二厘、香港票升一分二厘、法郎票升一厘二毫半、新加坡票安南票斐律濱票各升二分、荷蘭票升三分、羅比票坎拿大票各升一分、澳金票升四角、僅義大利票德金票暹邏票未更、</p>
<h3>紗花　大戶陸續斬結　棉紗難期振作</h3>
<p>紗市依然不振、且續趨一挫、良以實銷暗澹而無生色、致人心軟化、滇幫需要較夥、港幫亦稍有辦進、情況尚能支持一步、故跌後又復回高一些、然某大公司心思平常、將多額時時嘔吐、最近以來、斬結之數量約有七八千包之說、因此檯面稍形鬆懈、二十支雙馬現紗價最低做到三百九十一元、繼以搶帽子者忽來買進、又有一般說者、查其過去情況、跌至三百九十元關口、則復回升、此種盤頭、已有數次、午扣香港幫再進雙馬二百四十包、價爲三百九十一元半至二元、人心震盪、多方提拉、復上三元、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業相聚談論、實際交易仍清、市態疲憊、二十支雙馬外棧貨開價跌二元、爲三百九十三元、旋以某公司又來賣出、人氣尤鬆一步、最低價爲三百九十一元、棧單價爲三百八十八元、迨至收盤、稍有　便宜貨、又復回上一元、雙馬價爲三百九十二元、午後開盤以南幫需要重振、人氣由弱轉强、收盤價二十支雙馬爲三百九十四元半、棧單亦做到三百九十元零五角、結果各幫買去一千七百九十九包、行情二十支雙馬價比上日漲五角、其餘價格平均跌一元外、廠方款聞舉動、昨有棉紗八十五件運寗波、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　一、〇一五　雲南三一〇　香港三〇〇</p>

<p>寗波　一五　溫州　一九</p>
<p>統計一、七九九</p>
<p>日昨紗市塲需要雖清、然市氣稍振、二十支水月現紗價爲三在三十四五元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十四五元、比週末價漲一元光景、近日大戶頭有多有空、故市態平平、</p>
<h3>美棉各廠　正在索樣</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市因施密斯之棉業提案、未能順利進行、遭受意外、各戶又抱觀望、南方在市套賣頗烈、多頭獲利了結、因之紐約棉市由滯轉疲、下跌五六磅音、印棉本年預料難能豐收、價格難跌、昨日連同預測又漲一羅比半、埃及跌十餘磅音、匯兌無甚變化、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西棉每担跌三角半、埃及棉跌一元半、獨印棉又漲六角餘、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、昨日異常靜寂、良以紗價未能好轉故也、印棉未能尅日運出、恐爲各廠不訂印棉之主要理由、美棉交易、將有轉機、日來各廠均向各洋行索取棉樣、正在研究中、藉作日後之參考、申新廠昨日擬進蘭貢花一千件、限價相差過鉅、回電已轉、未能成交、茲將昨日棉價錄後、</p>

<h3>通州花　漲至七十七元</h3>
<p>本棉生意之清澹形同停頓、蓋以來源中斷、蘇北游擊區中戰事復劇、路途艱難、運貨停駛、故到貨愈稀、一般執貨者鑒於如斯環境、手中有貨居奇尤烈、故通州花開價已漲至七十七元之新價、且成交之少、猶如鳳毛麟角、廠方視此情形、非採外棉補救、不足以爲挽回也、江北一路二日到通花三百二十九包、寗波來姚花三千件、茲將現棉情形錄下、</p>
<p>美種打包花　八六·〇〇　裕豐廠進　二〇〇　現鈔送廠</p>
<p>通州花　七七·二〇　同業中進　六〇〇包　匯劃棧交</p>
<p>下沙花　七五·　〇　又　一五〇包　又　又</p>
<h3>疋頭　染坯用途　本街稍見開展東疋細布慘跌</h3>
<p>國布售盤紛歧、互有漲落、白貨細布因溫甬各口續辦二百餘包、永安廠大鵬細布現貨缺乏、乃購富貴等牌、售盤略堅、每疋加起五分之譜、細斜現銷不振、湘粵浙幫衹辦七八十包、惟本街染坯用途稍見發展、成交各牌一百五六十包、售價平穩、英商怡和廠粗布輕重磅開價、每疋一致降低五分至一角、與週前手貨售盤會合華廠各檔粗布開價不動、客銷零星、當令淺色漂白布疋價仍堅定、怡和金三塔漂布漲一角、浙路溫甬幫購漂布·漂斜·洋紗·府綢·色布等貨二百餘箱、閩汕幫亦購上列貨品二百數十箱、湘幫辦色布·漂布·漂斜二千餘疋、粵港幫辦藍布·色斜·白斜一百餘件、川滇幫因中途各貨延擱過多、需胃甚淡、新成交數額頗形瑣屑、</p>
<p>東布晨市白貨跌風續厲、龍頭細布一度慘落至十一元六角半、旋以本街染坯客戶趁廉踴躍抵補、全日成交各牌細布·細斜現期貨有一千餘件、市盤稍稍回升、情狀略穩、手貨仍肯鬆售、參次不一、較之週末、每疋猶降二分半五分、但行廠大盤始終堅定、</p>
<p>昨有疋頭四十件運寗波、</p>
<h3>毛織業又創一新廠</h3>
<p>本國毛織業向衹章華·協新·達隆·大上海·大光明等數家、英商則有怡和廠、八一三戰後、除怡和外、大都損失、日商行利用時機、創設永興宏康廠、在虹口出品、業內外人玉石不分、亦齊稱國貨、其實不然、以其價廉、故怡和等貨大受打擊、最近由春和永華新二家與新由回國華僑、創設完全國產呢絨工廠、因去年創立、故提寅豐爲名、出品亦歸該二號包銷、昨聞厚薄嗶嘰海令蓬元直黃呢等、已有出品、其質地較永興宏康等爲佳、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市投機　始稍歛迹</h3>
<p>粳秈等米一路暴漲、多爲米商販戶利用時機、從中作崇、近三日內各路到貨漸見疏通、如昨到有河下貨十一艘、及車運來包子四五千包、復經荳米業公會一再聲明限價雖不見效、及邀請工部局擬設平價委員會、投機分子不無顧忌、前數日手中拉進貨多者、即時回出、本街店胃亦都觀望、市形轉淡、各貨價格遂見分清、結果、若南北幫兩粳眼光上已跌落二三角、薄稻高貨亦落一二角、其中段貨及南港早稻則回瀉半元有奇、杜洋尖埠尖悉皆貶低二三角、僅變元貨稀定局耳、</p>
<p>客秈有獲利各囤趁高　出轉口幫觀望不動、新囤袖手、本街各戶納胃不宏、故全日成交數僅有一千多包、市價因浮戶貶價求脫、立見銳落三角　蕪湖南京最高價已自十三元半小至十三元二角、特別高貨亦有少數隨市售出、　核合跌小三角以上、緣近日米價上漲、並非真正米缺、完全人心作用、今客囤一停、市即下趨、市上傳說加放限價一舉、已不攻而破矣、</p>
<h3>粉守原盤　洋粉略昻本麥互持澳麥一船今晨起卸</h3>
<p>粉市並無重大變化、客幫交易、略轉活潑、北洋幫除辦二號車船牌粉外、並注意三四號紅財神·紅桃花等粉、成交達二萬餘包、惟南洋幫因廠盤較北洋幫見高五分、故進胃不暢、衹有數千包點綴、廠方以目下現粉供應不足、兼昨市洋粉價亦較昂、蓋美滙見縮、合價每包由四元增至四元一角、故售價並不遷就、結果仍守四元七角與六角半原盤、</p>
<p>麥市擯持如故、來源零星、每日約有一千包左右抵埠、大都直接送廠作價、並有日商粉廠暗中收買、市面無形暗抬、外傳最高價仍須七元四五角之說、惟各廠目下均注意訂購洋麥、迭有期貨成交、對於本麥交易、甚爲冷淡、故正式市面、續無成議、</p>
<p>英輪RothleY號、運來澳麥八千八百八十一噸、昨午已抵淞口、因浦江碼頭、浮筒均無隙地可靠、乃在口外拋錨、昨據該輪代理之行家云、浦東其昌棧已有碼頭可靠、故該輪定今晨六時進口、停靠其昌棧起卸云、</p>
<h3>糖市　太車白再升五分</h3>
<p>昨荷糖趨勢較平、公會劃盤、二四組白、本棧貨仍爲二十四元八角半、轉口貨呌十六元七角、但乏成交、太古車白西棧貨B嘜　續升五分、以二十四元七角、成交五十包、OW嘜二十四元六角、CX嘜五角、DY嘜四角、HX嘜三角、H嘜車赤及荷赤均無上落、國糖市象穩定、潮幫開出綿赤六十五包、十五元七角、提莊青三十餘包、十五元半、上隆青呌升二角、爲十三元七角、未成、興化大宮粉、特高莊呌二十四元、次之二十三元半、漳刁青仍在擯持中、聞產價稍有平落云、</p>
<p>昨有糖四百七十五包自香港來、又五百八十六包汕頭來、</p>
<h3>海味　建菇途貨不日到　產價漲起二十元</h3>
<p>建菇福州電訊、謂嶺菇產價每擔漲起二十元、高薄菇亦升十元、而出數尚少、聞途貨不日可到、惟各幫需求正殷、售盤將見上展、</p>
<h3>生粉存底單薄</h3>
<p>生粉此間存積如西頭號、業已稍完、其他各標、亦屬有限、刻市人鎗標爲十八元、比前市升起一元、飛麒麟標亦升二角、爲十六元二角、</p>
<h3>進出口　寗波來貨尚旺　建木七萬餘件進口</h3>
<p>昨自寗波運來烟葉六十件、皮油二百二十件、鮮蛋七百八十件、又自福州來木板七萬一千九百件、</p>
<h3>南北貨　汕粬無到建粬俏</h3>
<p>紅粬因汕頭不能出口、久乏續到、現市所存者、建粬爲多、故較低價時、前後已升近十元、高莊呌六十元、普通四十五六元、此後銷路將動、有再升之望、</p>
<h3>藥材　苦杏仁　來源告斷</h3>
<p>苦杏仁近以產地存積將罄、而津方又復限制出口、致來源斷絕、港幫辦胃仍濃、價遂增高、如前市四十五元之貨、昨日又成交十餘件、價爲六十二元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　溫炭湧到行市鬆</h3>
<p>溫州木炭、自准出口以來、現貨充溢、本市堆棧、計達兩萬餘擔之多、人心虛弱、暗盤回鬆、計開四十五磅大簍堅炭每擔四元八角、平簍松炭三元三角、比前跌去一二角、</p>
<h3>河南白煤暗盤愈堅</h3>
<p>河南白煤、自滬戰以來、到貨久斷、市上賴以供應者衹某津行由浦東搬出大批存貨、計七千餘噸、以資應市、惟手貨逐漸售罄、故售價日漲、昨暗盤又見堅挺、計開河南統煤每噸四十四元、篩塊四十六元、小子四十一元、棧房自車、行扛另加、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油背道而馳　豆餅期貨亦上漲</h3>
<p>昨日花生油與豆油市況漲跌互見、豆油雖聞大連市報跌、但人心良好、期現一致漲三四角不等、計開現大連油二百五十桶、（行情詳市價欄）三月下裝一百桶、三月內交五十桶、三月份一百桶、四月份七百桶、及烟岐油二百件、連岐油二百簍、大簍六十簍、花生油照到稍懸殊之情形觀察、其市則有漲無跌、但昨市在多頭獲利出籠、及謠傳其來源或許可轉大連而出運、故而人心渙散、市見挫修、計成交膠州油二百件、價爲二十九元、夾倉油五十件、價爲二十九元二角老規、烟台聽裝油一千六百聽　價爲二十六元七角、青島聽裝油一千聽、價爲三十八元、豆餅實銷有溫台泉州等幫辦去大有四牌餅四千片、價爲三元四角半、及五牌餅五百片、價爲三元二角四分、江北小餅一千片、價爲六角一分、行情均無軒輊、惟大連期餅在人心鼓勵下、上升四分、成交四月份二千片、價爲三元二角三分四、五月份一千片、價爲三元二角云、</p>
<h3>一年來　上海工商業的異動　（續）</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>推受股</p>
<p>一年來工商業的推受股，共計三百〇七家，內工廠五十一家，商號二百五十六家，在這三百〇七家推受股工商廠號裏，就工商業分類來分析，飲食業的七十九家爲首推了，次之爲衣着業五十三家，日用品業四十二家，金屬電氣業三十家，土木業十二家，衛生業十一家，文化業九家，醫藥業七家，行旅業六家，裝飾業·和娛樂業各五家，金融業和燃料業各三家，交通業和特種事業各二家，而不詳業別的，則有三十四家。</p>
<p>再說各月份推受股家數來比較，那末要以九月份的四十六家爲第一位了，十月份三十三家第二位，六月份二十九家第三位，八月份和十一月份各二十六家第四位，十二月份二十五家第五位，二月份和五月份各二十四家第六位，三月份二十三家第七位，四月份二十一家第八位，一月份十六家第九位，而以七月份十四家殿末位。這裏可以看出一年來的推受股業別，正是和畸形發展的相連繫着，也就是表面繁榮的各業。因爲是這樣，故而正常的工商業的推受股是衹佔總數之半罷了。其各月份推受股別家數，有如下表所列：</p>

<h3>滬西槍聲澈夜未停　游擊隊痛勦偽軍　作戰區域甚廣偽軍不支日派重兵往援始行撤退</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、虹橋哥爾夫球總會區域、日來駐有偽「綏靖軍」、游擊隊仍於昨（十二日）晚開始偽軍進攻、該區中之步槍·手槍·機關槍聲、澈夜斷續不息、日方因卽派出重兵、前往增援、至今晨七時、該區中猶聞或係界牌路近郊</p>
<p>傳出槍聲</p>
<p>游擊隊於午夜開始攻擊、羅別根河彼岸距虹橋路不遠之偽軍置有哨位處、卽發出手槍·步槍·與機關槍聲、大約游擊隊在距高爾夫總會不遠之河邊、架有機關槍一挺射擊之、但顯未迫近攻擊、槍聲歷一刻鐘左右、</p>
<p>卽趨沉寂</p>
<p>但至四時二十分、麥克勞路方面、復發出更密集之槍聲、歷時若干、游擊隊卽行移動、經過該區、於是該區附近多處地方均發出槍聲、游擊隊顯因日軍聞　、倉惶增援而引退、直至晨間七時、猶有斷續之槍聲、但今已西移、自界牌路近郊發生之昨晚游擊隊作戰</p>
<p>區域頗廣</p>
<p>傷亡如何、猶未確知、至拂曉時、猶有日軍開往該區各村、按戶搜查、聞鄉民有遭日軍虐待者、亦有被摑頰與蹴踢者、按昨晚被襲擊之「綏靖軍」、為日方所招募、以供守衛各區與「協助恢復秩序」者、放哨虹橋路之偽軍、非年事甚青、卽軀體瘦弱之徒、</p>
<h3>米業團體議决　維持原定限價　評價委員會定期成立勸吿行客取合作態度</h3>
<p>本市米業團體、為調節滬市民食、穩定市價起見、特於昨日下午二時、舉行聯席會議、並組織米糧評價委員會、推定委員十五人、定於本月十五日成立、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>七團體昨開聯席會</p>
<p>全市米業公會及各客帮團體、於昨日下午二時、在雜糧交易所二樓舉行聯席會議、計到豆米行業公會·米號業公會·碾米業同業公會·經售米糧業同業公會、各帮方面、計常熟米業公所·南帮公所·運米客商聯益會·等七團體、由豆米行業代表蔡裕焜主席、首由主席報告上週以來、滬市米價高漲、及存米數量、內地來源等等、茲本會等為維持民食起見、應以最大之努力使今後滬市米糧調節、市價穩定、臻於妥善之境域、在此非常時期、同業行客、體念時艱、切實合作、維持市塲之正常交易、繼由各團體代表張念萱·陸文韶·石祖福·蔣石稚·朱子香·等發表意見、對行客所處地位、以及米價繼漲之利害、闡述甚為詳盡、</p>
<p>一致議决仍維限價</p>
<p>末由主席將各代表發表意見、歸納結果、對於米價一案、决仍維持每石最高價為十四元、其中次號米照別、常經提付表决權時、在塲代表二十餘人、一致起立通過、並由市塲管理委員會、根據聯席會議決、公布市塲、俾衆週知、</p>
<p>組評價會定期成立</p>
<p>該聯會復即席議决為平準米價、調節民食計、由行客號各國體組織米糧評價委員會、依據前議限價、隨時評定價格、中次照例、委員額設十五人、推定豆米行業公會陳子　·蔡裕焜·周之楨·朱子香·符　耕、米號業公會張念萱·陸文韶·黃竹園·潘繼斌·史鴻動、碾米業公會朱兆圻·南帮公所嚴際雲、常熟米業公所石祖福、運米客商聯益會蔣石稚、經售米糧業公會章松濤等為評價委員、由豆米業公會符委員前耕為召集人、定於本月十五日、假上海商社舉行成立、並開第一次委員會、至委員會之組織、應呈報兩租界當局、嗣後評價、亦應隨時呈報之、</p>
<p>寬放限價已被否决</p>
<p>各米業團體昨日舉行聯席會議時、有若千米商、要求寬放限價、所以列席旁聽者、甚為擁擠、聞議决不准寬放限價、依據前議限價、隨時評定價格、一般米商、均表示不滿、滬市存米、尚有六十萬句之譜、暫時决不致發生缺乏恐慌、今米業各團體、除竭力設法疏通來源外、並取締囤積居奇、及投機操縱、業已派員隨時澈查、如發覺有操縱情事、决予嚴懲、</p>
<p>愛國團體警告米商</p>
<p>又據現代社記者從米業同業中探悉、因連日米價飛漲、暗盤交易特增、雖經公會竭力壓制、而市塲情形、依然混亂、但事關民食、各方異常重視、豆米業公會、忽於前日接得　　愛國團體警告信一件、並開具操縱行市之各行牌號等頗詳、其內容希望公會妥籌調節辦法、以維民食、並隨時取締奸商之囤積居奇、壟斷市價、</p>

<h3>駐滬美國海軍　昨在防區臨時戒備　阻止日憲兵及任何部隊侵入日方竟向美駐軍當局提抗議</h3>
<p>前日上午十時左右、在美軍防區內之南陽路三十九號「偽統稅局局長」邵式軍寓所、突有日憲兵部便衣人員四海軍陸進行某項工作、事為美海軍當局得悉、認為日憲兵侵入防區、妨害主權、即於十時三十分、飭派美國駐滬第四海軍陸戰隊士兵一卡車、馳抵該處、將該日憲兵逐走、不許逗留、昨晨、日方仍擬派憲兵重入該區、但仍遭美軍阻止、並不准任何日軍部隊通過、同時為防止意外起見、即宣布臨時戒備、自泥城橋起迄滬西越界築路地段止、沿途加派美軍駐守、情勢頗為緊張、日軍方面、竟以日憲兵之前往南陽路與美防軍主權、並無抵觸、今被阻止、認粗意侮辱、聞决向美防軍當局提出抗議、並以採取嚴峻行動等詞恫嚇、</p>

<h3>外弛內緊　租界嚴重性未减　美軍向工部局抗議不確日方依然逐步施行壓力</h3>
<p>工部局情報室公告云、今晨報紙曾載消息一節、內稱關於偵查恐怖行動之合作、最近本局與日方成立之諒解、已引起美國當道抗議云云、此項消息不確、查最近依照所定妥協辦法、在美軍防區內實行搜查之時、曾有一次有某種破例之舉動、美國當道乃請本局注意於此等破例之舉動、謂其與妥協辦法不符、本局已採取措置、俾此等舉動、不再發生、</p>
<p>日方壓力塗徑有三</p>
<p>外人方面訊、現日方向工部局施行壓力之途徑有三、（一）直接交涉、（二）經由外交之途徑、向有關各國政府施行壓力、（三）嗾使「大道」市政府不斷向工部局及領事團提出要求、</p>
<p>傳筱庵向法領要求</p>
<p>偽上海「市長」傳筱庵、近受嗾使、除日前向公共租界工部局及上海領事團方面、提出五項無理「要求」外、昨竟又向駐滬法總領事、提出三項「要求」、措詞荒謬怪誕、茲摘録該項「抗議書」大略如下、（一）查暗殺案之發生、實為貴租界當局容納國民黨及共產黨亂徒、聽任若輩在租界內自由活動、陰謀不軌所致、應請貴租界當局、速與本市府合作、務須清查戶口、如查有黨員證據、一律驅逐出境、其有私藏軍火者、依法從嚴懲辦、其華界及公共租界交界之各路要口、更應嚴密防範、加緊檢查、以維治安、而杜亂源、（二）查上海第二特區地方法院、未經本府收回管轄、亦為發生暗殺事件重要原因之一、蓋該院係在重慶黨府統治及支持之下、對於同一陣綫之暴亂份子、雖經逮解、决不能盡法懲治、因此本府主張持區法院院長、及全體推事檢查官、必須一律易人、另由新政權　員接替、以符體制、（三）查維新政府以五色旗為國旗、凡在維新政府統制下之地區、自應一律遵照懸掛、乃貴租界區內、迄仍懸掛前黨政府之青天白日滿地紅旗、因此人心思亂、而國共兩黨不良份子之作惡氣燄、亦因之而愈張、其影響社會人心、與國家體制、殊屬重大、應請於文到之日起、即行禁止懸掛青天白日滿地紅旗、如果不加禁止、則以後因懸旗問題而發生事故時、其一切責任、應由貴租界當局完全負擔、（下略）</p>
<p>逮捕華人逕交日方</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據今日（十三日）消息、自日當局與工部局締結協定後、日方便衣憲兵已與公共租界巡捕合作、而逮捕華人八名、聞此八人、均未經公共租界警備方面成立表面上有確實證據之案件、即直接交與日當局、其中四人、係本月七日午後九時在湖北路孟淵旅館第二二五與二三八號房間內被捕者、另有一人、係翌日午後六時、在牯嶺路一四五弄十九號就逮、第六人係本月十二日在成都路禮福里三號補逮、而於昨晨七時、雲南路揚子飯店七一九號房間內、復有二人被捕、彼等被指犯何罪、咸未透露、聞逮捕時雖由公共租界巡捕協助之、但僅由日憲兵加以　訊、</p>

<p>此項支出</p>
<p>亦達二百萬元、關於辦理空襲善後、則凡死者埋掩、及傷者醫治、均給現款、此項支出三十五萬七千元、惟最感困難者、為戰區內之救濟工作、外國教會團體及國際　善組　、均於此種工作、多所盡力、受賑人數總計、直接受該會現款救濟者、約三百九十七萬人、由各地當局經手、而</p>

<h3>太古公司計劃增輪　航行港緬新綫　接駁滇緬港進出口貨運淪緬空航與帝航綫聯接</h3>
<p>據航業界消息、自華南局面轉　、中國與歐美海上交通、漸由廣州而移至滇緬與滇越間、獨香港與仰光之交通、因戰事影響、歐美輸華一切貨品、及中國土貨出口、均出輪直運至港、然後轉運海防、仰光、轉輸昆明、或由昆明運港、是以港仰交通一綫、日形密切、貨運來往之頻繁、實為從來所罕見、</p>
<p>外商增輪行駛港緬</p>
<p>外商航業界因華北長江航運、遭日方壟斷後、一向航行之輪船、均告停頓、故對於港緬航綫、早已注意、尤其英國航商、其在華北長江航運停頓之太古及鐵行兩公司輪船、現已計劃增派輪加輸入此綫航行、至於港中其他內河輪船公司、為發展其自身業務計、亦起而競爭、决乘時航行港緬綫云、據太古洋行消息、該會司對們增派輪船、航行此綫、現正考慮中、一俟計劃完竣、即可實現、並將由港公司主持之、</p>
<p>淪緬空航實行聯接</p>

<h3>淪陷區日貨充斥　輸入躍居首位　企圖獨霸在華貿易各國利益均遭奪刦</h3>
<p>戰後日本企圖獨霸在華貿易、鉅量日貨輸入傾銷、其佔領區域、日貨充斥、英美各國貨物、均受影響、採辦土貨、必須由日發給採辦證、主要土貨均被統制裝輪輸日、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>日本獨霸在華貿易</p>
<p>日本在其佔領區域內、設法限制第三國貨物輸入、以日本之工業取代其佔領區域中之外商地位、並以鉅量日貨、輸入傾銷、企圖獨霸在華貿易、此外並拒絕開放長江、阻撓第三國航行、以致其佔領區域、日貨充斥、英美各國幾乎絕跡、關於主要土貨、如棉花·雜糧·皮革·毛類等、組織大規模公司收買、裝日輸運日、充作原料之用、第三國商人、如欲收買、必須經日本之核准、發給採辦證書、於是英美各國在華貿易、均大受影響、</p>
<p>日貨傾銷輸入激增</p>
<p>自去年八月起、日貨之輸入激增、實行其傾銷政策、八月份輸入為二千三百八十二萬五千元、九月份輸入為二千四百七十五萬七千元、十月份輸入為二千零六十二萬五千元、十一月份輸入為三千二百四十六萬七千元、十二月份輸入為二千七百五十七萬四千元、今年一月份輸入為二千六百七十一萬元、以上各月日貨輸入、均佔第一位、貨物以棉布·人造絲·機器·五金·海產品·日用雜貨·糖·酒·書籍·地圖·木造紙質·木材·石料·泥土·雜貨等為最多、</p>
<p>英美各國均受影響</p>
<p>戰前及戰事初起之時、各國對華進口貿易、向以美國佔第一位、日·英·德·法·等國次之、自去年八月起、日貨輸入、躍登首位、美國降居第二位、英·德·法·等均漸退色、則足證各國對華貿易、受日貨傾銷、及限制第三國貨物輸入、影響甚鉅、使第三國商人在華利益、遭受較前任何時代更大打擊、所以各國商人均認為若不予以制裁、則此後日本佔領區域內之第三國商人、勢將無法繼續營業、幸非淪陷區域、外貨照常銷售、</p>
<h3>難救會提存　準備基金　十萬元</h3>

<h3>紀念孫總理逝世　法租界禁止懸旗　認為縣旗有「政治性」照法租界定章應干涉</h3>
<p>大陸報云、公共租界人員、昨日（十二日）對懸掛中國國旗紀念孫總理逝世十四週年事、雖未加干涉、然法租界市政當局竟不准懸中國國旗、法租界公董局高等人員語記者、承認法租界對懸掛旗幟、曾有定章、但該員復解釋云、在法租界懸中國旗幟、僅與「政治活動」有關者始加以干涉、鑒於本埠國民黨黨部發出宣言、促請上海人民懸旗以為紀念儀式之一部、故此次懸中國旗、純屬「政治性」云、昨日午後曾聞法租界巡捕隊入華人房屋、令取下國旗事數起、捕隊曾入大世界附近某屋內、令屋主去旗、致引起旁觀者頗衆、</p>

<h3>夫婦悲劇的原因和補救</h3>
<p>一夫一妻是文明社會中最好的家庭制度。一對夫妻，男强女健，各個盡其功能，在農村社會中男耕女織，在都市社會中男子出外經營商業或工業，女子在家裏料理家務，夫婦愛情體貼而溫存，生育子女活潑而伶俐，這當然是一個和樂而健全的家庭。這種健全的家庭，不特他們夫妻兩個享受着快樂和幸福，也是社會的良好而安定的基礎，關係於民族國家，非常重大。我們在生理心理上的研究，一對男女，各因其生理需要而結為夫婦，應該宜爾家室，愛情濃厚，樂勝于飛，何為而要在家庭裏發生着悲劇呢？</p>
<p>家庭悲劇的原因，雖有多端，但除了男子過於貪心，討了一個老婆之外，還要來一個妾或是另行金屋藏嬌，則所謂「若要家人不和，討個小老婆」。多了女人，鷄犬不寗之外，其最多的就是男子性能的衰弱。我們在女子心理上的研究。她除非不嫁他，如果一嫁了他，那就將整個的身心都支給了他。只要他能予以充分的快樂和安慰，那她就感覺着終其生只有一個他以了解她，所以說痴心女子負心郎，女子大都是痴情的。可是男子若於早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，致精枯血竭，在性機能方面發生病態，在腦，脊髓，神經方面，更時覺頭脹腦痛，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，心神不寗，腰　背痛，肢體疲憊等症。此種男子在夫婦生活上，將如何能領受妻之熱情？熱情而被欺騙，這是如何痛心疾首的事！若長此犧牲，能不使她惱羞成怒！演出家庭間種種的悲劇！在今日社會上妻子與人發生關係，或明目張胆與夫法庭相見振振有詞訴請離婚者，實時有所聞，此種丈夫遭此悲慘，他內心上的痛苦，試易地思之，能不淚下？同時因身體過弱，何能受此嚴重刺激，若再憂傷過度，更有形成未老先衰，或竟早年殤亡之慘！</p>
<p>不過，聰明的男子，我們知道上述病症並不是不治之症，如能對症治療，必可恢復健康，據世界名醫及余多年輕騐，均公認服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對症而特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可將上述病症完全治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。</p>
<h3>遺精為最傷身的疾病</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>因為精液是我們生命的源泉，所以遺精是最足以傷身害命的疾病。現在我們分析言之，有下列數點：我們一個人體內的精液，係攝取食物中最貴重的養料，經過生理上種種物理化學的奧妙作用，才由睪丸製成而流注於精囊。如果流注過多了，果然也要呈過　狀態中之溢精，大約未婚而成年的健壯男子每月也有一二次。這是生理的不能算為病態。可是由溢精而致犯手淫，或由手淫或其他的意淫招致了病態遺精，也是很多，不可不慎重預防。總之，精液在體內除非因生理的溢精和婚後合法的性交之外，（但亦不可荒淫，荒淫後也有種種弊害。）精液能够豐富地保留在體內，對於身體實有莫大的裨益。因為它功能調整新陳代謝作用，助長發育機能，滋養各部神經，以及健腦補腎增强精力等種種用處。如果青年而一有遺精，或由遺精惡化成滑精漏精，則體內精液即無法貯蓄，必至精估血竭，是以新陳代謝作用减退，在身體之各部組織，只有老細胞死去而甚少新細胞之產生，遂呈面黃肌瘦，生命之活力减少，若長此下去，可以未老而先衰，發育機能受阻，致身材低矮，性器短小，如童稚，此外在腦脊髓，性三大神經方面，亦陷於衰弱症象，常有腦力不濟，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，腰　背痛，肢體疲憊。腎虧無能，精力渙散等症，並且精液之不絕遺洩，生理上不及產生，致精液中常缺乏精　，或竟至全無，就造成不育症。…凡此種種，我們可以知道，遺精不特傷身，並能絕嗣，其危險為何似！至如性能衰弱，在夫妻生活上無法圓滿，更將造成人生莫在的悲慘！此症之唯一治法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以為服「希米脫氏固精片」，最為特效。服後即能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，戒除邪念，遺精無不可以立即斷根。但如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以增補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，調整新陳代謝作用，促進發育機能，若繼續服用，必能早日完全恢復健康。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>你瞧！乳峯多麼重要</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>竟然操縱着女性一生命運</p>
<p>『牡丹雖好，全仗綠葉扶持』，一個無論怎樣漂亮的女子，假如沒有一對高聳的乳峯和丯腴的臀部，把曲線美充分顯露，那麼即使妳衣錦綉之袍（旗袍），戴珍貴之飾，革履絲襪，點唇畫眉，終覺得美中不足，正似牡丹少了綠葉，不但在交際塲中，不能左顧右盼，表示自己的健美，而為人竊突，即於夫婦之間的私生活上，試問一塊平坦無垠的怪模樣，一觸入妳丈夫的眼　，這時妳心中的感想如何？妳丈夫的感想如何？我知道妳的丈夫即使當面不說，然而他對妳的愛情，便會漸漸的冷淡下來，或竟至在外恒歌酣舞，微妓宿娼，妳雖然老大的不開心，但是一想到自身的種種缺陷，就祇好苦在心頭，抑鬰寡歡，不但此也，因乳峯萎　的結果，關係女性整個健康的卵巢機能必然失健，新陳代謝力亦失交替作用，於是月經不調，白帶黏漣，宮冷不娠，性感淡薄等症，勢必相繼踵至，遂致生育艱難，終其生而不獲一孕，雖有百萬家產，亦祇好拱手讓人，一念及此，乳峯對於女性的幸福，關係實在大了。</p>
<p>然則此種缺陷，難道竟無法彌補嗎？那倒不，據世界著名生理學家兼美容專家康德林與婦科名醫湯潑生等一致主張，如女子患有乳房萎　，臀部瘦小，月經不調，帶多不娠，性感淡薄等症，可服奧國斯丹那博士發明的卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，最為對症而特效，蓋此劑係提取壯健動物的卵巢精質，經過科學煉製，試想：以壯健動物的卵巢精質，補入卵巢機能失健的女性，無怪服後一畫夜間，即能發揮偉大的藥力，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，能使萎　的乳峯，漸漸高聳，瘦削的臀部，變得丯腴，且能增旺血液，使白色肌膚，從滋潤而白晳的皮肉裏透出鮮紅的光彩。</p>

<h3>淋病何法最易斷根</h3>
<p>淋病難治，實為一般人週知之事，而實亦不知其亦易治之病也。蓋許多淋病的症狀，錯綜萬變，而療淋之方法，亦新舊各異，舊醫因從未看到淋病為何物，自然談不到有何療法，固矣。而一般新醫對於淋病，亦往往弄得棘手，亦不鮮也。其實不然，查淋毒一症，初起者固易治，但言其病未深入耳，若治法不得其當，則此易治之急性淋，未有不成為慢性淋，世之患慢性淋者何可數計，而其初固未有不經過急性淋者。故謂急性淋易治，亦未得當。然謂慢性淋難治，亦未一槪而論，余以十數年來治愈慢性者，不下數千百餘人，謂其難治，余何以確實治愈之成績，有如許之多，且多經工部局衛生處證明其無淋菌，並從未再發者。總之治療急慢性自濁，若診斷精確，治法對症，均屬易治之花柳病。</p>
<p>現在且舉急性淋中之攝護腺炎，及慢性淋中之尿道狹窄二症為例。急性攝護腺炎。如經確切診斷之後，卽可注射特製自家菌苗，並用肛門之冷却或溫　法，及坐藥法溫湯灌腸法等，因症施用。在一二天內即可將急性攝護腺炎腫消退。如淋毒性狹窄，則可用台維氏新式　齊，作無之尿道擴張法，膀胱有夙尿潴留，脹滿欲裂者，可速行手術排尿，以防尿中毒，此時全在醫生手眼明快，庶幾可以將極危險之淋病，在極短時期中治愈。而對於此等症狀中，在電療方面，自以濾淋平流電療法為有特效。凡此急慢性淋，若用一般平庸療法，及見識不廣之醫生，絕對不能在短期中獲愈。</p>

<h3>財窟股東李品泉　犯有殺人嫌疑</h3>
<p>李興爪牙毆打華捕案昨日續審十七日宣判</p>
<p>前滬西槍殺案四起與李有關</p>
<p>滬西白利南路廣生公司賭塲股東南京人李品泉、於上月十四日、因見有小車一輛、停於該財塲衖外之路旁、認其阻碍財徒之出入、倚勢欺凌車夫、當時站崗途中之靜安寺捕房二五四九號華捕、見若輩沿途滋擾、遂向制止、詎李竟憑藉特殊勢力、指揮該賭塲保鏢、即個中人稱之為抱檯脚者之爪牙江北人武秀峯、欲強將該捕拽入非租界警權所及之左近衖內、而</p>
<p>肆意逞兇</p>
<p>、幸該捕立即　鳴槍　自衛、鄰崗聞聲馳到、協同將李武兩名拘獲、解送第一特區地方法院審究、因捕房以李尚犯有他案、須予偵查、故令押候查明再訊、曾誌前報、茲悉現經捕房查明者、雖確有殺人案發生於上年十月九日、其地點則屬本市淪陷前市警察局滬西六區轄境之鄉間「盧錫寨」地方、而與公共租界之白利南路相近、被</p>
<p>開槍擊斃</p>
<p>者名朱老五及一陳姓、並有陸小泉亦遭流彈射傷、該案起因、似近仇殺、緣李品泉（又名李五）與朱老五素　稱交好、若輩前乘滬戰紛亂之際、曾以非常手段、攘得大量毛竹、消　後所獲不貲、李經分得賊款數千金、但自是與朱結怨極深、嗣朱陳等均投入偽組織之「稅務機關、」充當搜刮蘇州河西端船戶之「船捐」差使、是日朱陳偕一</p>
<p>方海清者</p>
<p>刮得船戶「捐」資、盈　歸去、以便孝敬其「主子」、經過盧錫寨時、突出暴徒四人、持槍射擊朱陳、當塲飲彈斃命、陸適行經其地、遂被池魚之殃、日前由捕房派探將業已傷愈之陸小泉與另一路人陳邦達、傳赴捕房查訊當時情狀、陸謂彼於是日為流彈擊傷、兇手為誰、彼殊不知、陳稱、彼聞槍聲、立時奔避、故亦不知兇手</p>
<p>係何許人</p>
<p>及後由幹探將方海清查到、詳加盤詰之下、方自承興李朱兩方俱有相當關係、李得所消竹料賊款時、彼亦由李分給十元、作為保守其事秘密之代價、是日彼與朱陳等偕行、迨聞槍聲返顧、則朱陳均已被殺倒地、其時李五（即李品泉）確在出事處、且兇手四人中之一為李五之子云云、捕房復就該案中之所獲彈壳、予以</p>
<p>精密察驗</p>
<p>後、斷定前在　開納路·勞勃生路·極司非爾路等處、先後發生槍殺案四起、所用之武器、悉與殺朱等兇器相同、但李品泉迭經捕房反覆究詰、矢口否認、且供其子今祇十八歲、猶在讀書、昨晨又由戴榮鐸推事飭提李武兩名到庭續審、捕房律師錢恂九聲明前次之所請改期者、以須偵查李所犯之另案、茲　已查明其槍殺</p>
<p>朱陳二命</p>
<p>並傷一陸小泉、惟捕房對於該案現尚不擬進行、故今僅對所訴該兩被告予以審判、當時被告加於該捕之暴行、設無他捕聞警馳至、而予援助、則該捕必為其強拖入衖、釀成惡劣之後果矣、李旣以所有汽車、供給廣生公司賭塲作為迎送賭客之具、武則充該</p>
<p>賭塲保鏢</p>
<p>自難聽任推諉、應請一併嚴加懲辦云云、庭上即就所控歐捕事件、向李武兩犯研鞫一過、並由其辯　護律師　范剛俞恩良　為之辯　論終結、戴推事遂諭定期本月十七日上午宣判、李等兩名仍飭解回捕房覊押、</p>

<h3>閒談上海藥房中之配方事業</h3>
<p>— 鄭鏡人</p>
<p>病人有良醫，方不致枉死，有良醫而無良藥，病亦不能治，有良藥而無學騐豐富之正式樂師配製，則亦可誤人生命於一旦，故任何內服或外用藥物均非山藥師處理不可！</p>
<p>上海市為我國之特殊區域，八一三前我國之衛生法令尚可達於兩租界行政當局，而一切光怪陸離新藥之廣告，即滿佈於報紙中，亦無任何機關過問。</p>
<p>配方事業為藥房中主要營業之一，依理應聘用正式藥師主任其事，决非任何人所能為。但環顧本市（法租界當局現已規定界內每一藥房應以藥師經營否則不能開業）該業配方室中聘有正式藥師者恐十之二三而已，其尤甚者新開設規模較小之藥房，非但藥師無之，即藥劑生亦難　到。配方室中之清潔與管理亦復毫無秩序可言，該業當局視能左右人命及關乎民族保健問題至大之配方事業不重要如此，殊足令人驚異，且配就之藥物設有錯誤，病人無從知悉，誤病誤人，能致人命於瞬息，豈可不格外慎重從事！藥劑配製時設不小心極易錯誤，前某醫院中有以Atropina誤配為Atophan之大錯，想類乎此者更不知幾許，兼之現有一部分之藥房當局喜購賤價之偽　以供配方之用，如以　　酸稀釋後冒充杏仁水，以柳酸　以醋酸後冒充阿士匹林出售，尤屬荒謬絕偷害人不淺，設有病人誤服此類偽樂後病症變化或至不起，亦不疑誤於偽藥之害，而定以為醫師診斷之錯誤，故樂房配方室中所用之藥物，一過有懷疑之處即應山藥帥先行檢騐後方能應用，否則徒令病人受無妄之　。</p>
<p>配方事業為藥房中獲利最厚之營業，實不應草率從事，商人重利，自古言之，但藥業關乎人命，又何能見利忘義！</p>

<h3>痳疹中之攝生</h3>
<p>— 蘇曾祥</p>
<p>—為父母者注意—</p>
<p>痳疹俗名出痧子，又名瘄子，各地名目不同，待疹子旣出之後，大家都能認識，民間認為這種病症是小兒所不可或免的，而且是可怕的傳染病之一。</p>
<p>經騐吿訴我們，痳疹本身並不危險，但是為什麼又認為可怕呢？不懂醫學的人說：怕牠「出不出」，「出或不透」。懂醫學的人說：怕牠有合併症，如肺炎，中耳炎，氣支管炎，真性或假性白喉，肺癆，淋巴腺腫脹等等。其實所謂「出不出」，或「出不透」者，就是因為有合併症的緣故。德國醫學界治療痳疹，或痳疹而已有合併症的小孩，往往使病人頭戴帽子，身包厚被，穿得暖暖的，只露一個面孔，病床放在走廊下或花園內，結果都很好。因此他們的死亡率，要比我們少得多多呢！有些人聽了，或許要說我在夢囈。但是這是我所目觀的事實。本來只要身上暖熱，就使有冷空氣，從鼻腔而入肺部，也已由冷變溫，並不為患了。反觀我國大多數人家，遇到一個小孩患痳疹，就緊閉了窗門，朦了被，還要在火爐內薰　子什麼的，弄得室內烟霧　漫，濁氣四溢。在這樣混濁的空氣之中，不生肺炎，仍不知過患之源，反說痳疹本身是危險的。有一個病家告訴我說，數年前她的小孩患痳疹，她抱了小孩，坐在四不通氣的蚊帳內，床下薰東西，弄得小孩兩眼不住地往上翻，後來經人勸告，才算中止。請問這種治療法，豈非緣木而求魚？要知痳疹，經過三四天的發熱涕涙等發炎狀態之後，只要肺臟心臟保護得好，沒有合併症，自然就會發出來。我們當然希望牠發得快，退得慢，面孔紅而不要青，不過要知道，在污濁的空氣之中，身體軟弱的情形之下，痳疹可以與肺炎，（是原發性的，不是續發性的）同時並來。一患肺炎之後，皮膚毛細血管流阻止，疹子即不是發出來，甚至有發出來而再立即退下去的。到那個時候，就是俗所謂「出不出」與「出不透」了，所以我們最要緊的，必要察其原因，明白事理，不要一味以誤傳誤，以致背道而馳。此外一般人還認為患痳疹，應當封牢兩目及口鼻，結果弄到面都不敢揩，這也是容易引起中耳炎和肺炎的一個原因。我回想到小時候，看見一個親戚，她常常兩眼瞅瞅的，人家告訴我，這是她出痧子後所得到的病象。至於患痳疹後兩耳流膿，（中耳炎的結果），大家尤認為常事，痳疹還可以促進肺癆等等疾病，更不是普通人所意料得到的。其實一切都可以預防而避免的，我們大可不必作這種無謂之犧牲。所以痳疹之是否可怕，其關鍵還在自己之能否攝生！</p>
<p>至於痳疹是「小兒所不可或免的傳染病」一語，也非確論，我有一個朋友，她的兩個小孩，一個十歲，一個十一歲。因為她防範得很嚴密，所以至今還沒有出過痧子，可見痧子是可以由事離而避免的！有人誤信「不可或免」之說，甚而以為早早出了，反為安心，其實這是完全錯誤的。小孩年紀愈幼，身體抵抗力愈弱，得合併症的機會也愈多。譬如肺部本來軟弱的小孩，經痳疹之後，很有使肺病由潛伏期而變為進行性的可能。這都是普通一般人所知道的醫學常識。</p>
<p>現在我把折衷的，合國人環境的，輕而易舉的痳疹攝影生法寫在下面，希望做父母的人注意：（一）室內空氣極力使之清潔，在屋隅無風處開個小窗，房間溫度和暖適中，勿使病人悶在被內。較小的小孩，可以常常交換携抱位置，使肺臟各部都得活動，以防肺炎。如用火爐，那末要置沸水於爐上，水汽上升，室內空氣就不致乾燥，勿薰　子，勿吸香烟，閒人愈少愈妙，以便保持室內空氣之清潔。（二）每日以棉花浸糖水或硼酸水洗滌病入口部，對於較大的小孩，應常令漱口；鼻腔以牙　捲棉花潤硼酸水洗之；兩目亦以硼酸水用棉花揩拭。（三）小兒患傷風咳嗽肺炎等症，極易併發中耳炎，故須注意病人兩耳有無痛楚及異狀，可及早滴橄欖油一滴。嬰孩如以兩手攫耳或抓頭，這就表示嬰孩的耳內也許有痛楚，宜即予以檢查。（四）噴汽法：用長二三尺的長頸鉛壺盛沸水置水酒爐或電爐上燒之，待水汽噴出之時，移置小孩床頭，愈近口部愈佳，此法可以防止肺炎及中耳炎之發生。（五）大便固不可瀉，但亦須每日有一次。（六）房間光綫勿太強烈以免刺激目力。（七）出疹後五六日不退熱或熱退而復高，那末必定有合併症了，宜詳細檢查其病源之所在而醫治之。（八）飲食方面，輕軟易消化而富於滋養的東西，都可以吃的，油膩固非所宜，但絕對吃素，也屬不可，易使小孩陷於更軟弱狀態之下。</p>
<p>失病常識</p>
<h3>糖尿病與多尿病（上）</h3>
<p>— 周振禹</p>
<p>糖尿病一症，中醫稱為消渴病。惟其文載，未盡詳細。多數中醫以口渴多尿者，即為消渴病也。查口渴多尿一徵，固係糖尿病之要徵，但非僅糖尿病有之，而多尿病亦呈此徵象。糖尿病有糖尿病之起因與病理，多尿病有多尿病之起因與病理，兩者不能混為一說，其理至為明顯，是以消渴病究屬何指，不能不下一疑問。茲將兩病申詳於后，供讀者研究，庶免張冠李戴也。</p>
<p>糖尿病之起因</p>
<p>糖尿病之起因，由於胰　虧損，胰　者，人體器官之一，具有兩種不同之機能，一主持消化，其消化之機能，仍在產生一種酵素，輸入十二指腸，與食物混和而消化之。其酵素有三類：曰蛋白質酵，曰脂肪質酵，曰澱粉質酵，蓋因食物含有蛋白質，脂肪質，澱粉質故也。</p>
<p>食物經過胃腸，與酵素混和，則發生酵化作用，將食物之質地，化為人體合用之物質，如濩粉質化為葡萄糖，而滲入血液，以供人體之應用是也。</p>
<p>每餐後，發生神經衝動，胰臟受此衝動，則分泌酵素，可由胰管取出作種種試騐，生理學家名之曰外分泌。</p>
<p>同時胰臟另生一種物質，主持消糖作用，類似酵素，由胰臟內另一種細胞組織所產生者也。此種細胞集合成羣，散布於胰臟組織內，互不相連接，形若海洋之島，初為蘭氏（Langerhaus）所發現，故名曰蘭氏島。該島之細胞，營造一種物質，名曰英蘇要（Insulin），英蘇林為拉丁文，乃鳥素之意。鳥素之入血液，無管道通行，藉滲透作用，侵潤血液內，不能直接取出外界，作種種試騐，故名之曰內分泌。</p>
<p>島素設或缺乏，抑或完全告絕，血液所吸收之糖分，非但不能為身體應用，且有一部分，變為有機酸酮等類之毒質。此類毒質，隨血液而循環，往往麻痺神經，如不早治，輕則有神經疼，重則發生腦痺（Coma），一部分則由尿便排泄而出，故化騐小便，糖則現矣。</p>
<p>侈食易使胰臟疲勞，胰臟疲勞，分泌則不平衡，分泌不平衡，糖尿則難免。嗜酒者，因血流含酒醇，胰臟受刺過甚，初或多生鳥素，以致食量增加，餐必逾於常人　所謂鳥素豐盈症是也。久後胰臟疲勞，內分泌虧虛，糖尿病逐漸成矣。患有梅毒症者，血液含有毒質，或使血管硬化，或侵襲胰臟，使其分泌不平衡，此亦成糖尿病之一因素也。其他如霍亂，傷寒，白喉，瘧疾，脾脫疽等等之傳染病，亦因毒質，隨血循環，障礙胰臟之機能，而致血液糖分增高，尿液含糖，其又一因素也。</p>
<p>糖尿病之病理</p>
<p>糖尿之為病，經鳴氏，梵梅氏，秀氏，及夏氏諸人之研究，現已確定為胰臟之病。繼又經柯氏，德氏，都氏，狄氏，及斑氏諸人之研究，知為胰臟內分泌缺乏之所致，且可直接由熱血動物之胰臟，製造內分泌物質，名曰島素是也。島素又輕毫氏，毛氏，卜氏，戴氏，及馬氏諸人，用下級動物，再三試騐，知其功用有三焉</p>
<p>（一）促進澱粉質之新陳代謝作用。</p>
<p>（二）增加血液內之葡萄糖，化為動物體內所能儲藏之澱粉質的機能。</p>
<p>（三）增進氣化機能。</p>
<p>故胰臟一旦虧損，內分泌則有所障礙，上列三種功用則消失，而糖尿病遂成，患有糖尿病者，亡故後，解剖其胰臟，往往發現蘭氏島帶有病徵，故糖尿病，可進一步言，則為蘭氏島之病，其理不言可知矣</p>
<h3>醫海涓滴（續）</h3>
<p>— 思齋</p>
<p>脂肪泄瀉</p>
<p>胰液分泌障礙時，則脂肪分解及吸收，皆失常態，故病人之糞便，帶有脂膩光澤而含有多量之中性脂肪，鏡檢上可見多數之脂肪滴及肥皂素。若是者，名之曰脂肪泄瀉。</p>
<p>生理的或食餌的瀉劑</p>
<p>凡有慣習性便秘者，在治療上宜注意食養療法。麥飯，野蔬，薯，豆，蕈，桃李等果實，糖，蜜，脂肪類等，能使腸蠕動活潑，故合用之。上述諸品，稱之曰生理的或食餌的瀉劑。</p>
<p>肝癆</p>
<p>肝癆之名詞，並非指肝之結核性疾病。在肝膿腫經過中，每有發熱，其消耗性而衰弱者，往往有惡寒及盜汗，其症狀頗似肺癆，故有肝癆之名。</p>

<h3>讚美四存學校師生</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>「一二八」這一役中，我們知道復旦大學和暨南大學，有好多學生，衝上火錢，參加抗戰。「八一三」之後，道樣的學生，也到處可見。他們不顧一切，參加救國的直接行動，我們讚美他們。</p>
<p>北平某大學教授，自從北平淪陷後，就率領了一部份學生和工人等，到西郊去實行游擊，這樣實行愛國的敎帥，我們讚美他。</p>
<p>上海四行孤軍，不屈不撓，誓以最後一滴血，保全最後一片國土，直等到最高統帥下令撤退，方才全師而過蘇州河南，這樣的英勇，我們也讚美他們。</p>
<p>現在，我們一看到冀南四存學校帥生的「忠勇壯烈」，我們的讚美又不能不一致傾注到這些帥生的身上了。</p>
<p>他們，以學生言，「大多係未成年靑年」。他們全體參加，與敵人「作殊死戰」，較之復旦各校學生，尤為難能可貴。他們，以敎師言，個個就是北平某敎授，良師萃於一校，也很啡得。而他們，師生全體，「往往徒手奪槍」，且「器械父窳利太差，故傷亡頗重」，較之四行孤軍，更為艱苦。即使他們成了姚子靑的孤軍，今軍覆沒，我們自當為之馨香祝禱，俎豆千秋，而他們居然還能「全部突圍而出」，「斃日軍白餘名，燬日軍汽車五輛」，「其事蹟足以泣鬼神而喪日軍之膽」，我們那得不五體投地，竭誠讚美，謂為「全國學校師生之模範」呢！</p>
<p>在他們原不過一意殺敵，盡忠報國，並不希冀我們的讚美，或政府的「優予獎卹」，但他們的讚美和獎卹，地份所應得的，並且，我相信，他們「慷慨勇敢之精神」，終將歷千秋萬世而不滅！</p>
<p>返看我們現在上海學校裹的師生怎樣呢？其中常然有着里，救國事功，也足以令人讚美的優良份子；然而我們却時常聽見有「不准有愛國組織」的校長，主張「寗為太平犬，莫作亂離人」的國文敎帥，以及「救國不忘跳舞」的靑年學生。我們對於這些，眞是欲哭無淚，不知涕泗之何從！</p>
<p>我們不知道他們的「四存原來是什麼意義。但我們可以說，「為天地存正氣，為民族存志氣，為國家存元氣，為士林存義氣」，他們足可以當這個「四存」而無愧色！</p>
<h3>鋸橋</h3>
<p>— 鄒堯生</p>
<p>小明像從遠處跑來，頭上直冒着熱氣，氣喘喘的向同六十老爹閒談着的阿元使了一下眼色，像是又緊張，又慌惶的：使六十與阿元不禁在閒逸的情緒中一楞。</p>
<p>「年輕人眞不會鎭靜，有什麼消息嗎？說吧，這兒只有我們倆。」六十說了，臉是那麼寗靜的，眼旁和額上有着縐紋，劃出了他的年老。</p>
<p>「老張報吿說：第三小隊明朝要離鎭，一輛大汽車，一輛小篷車，已經加足油啦！大約天亮七點鐘要經過××路到×鎭的。」</p>
<p>「是置的？」阿元興奮的問。</p>
<p>「當然，老張說得那麼眞，還叮囑我別失了這個機會。」</p>
<p>「一小隊……一輛大車，一輛小車……××路……七點……」六十獨自在咕膿着這些字眼，像有縝密的思慮似的。</p>
<p>夜降臨的時候，這三位熱血的同志，在晚霧裏消失了背影。</p>
<p>弓似的新月已掛上遠處的樹梢，一條砂屑的狹長古道，從老遠的東方曲折而伸展到西北的盡頭。道中間，橫着一條死河。從月光映照着水面的漪紋看來，却並不像一般汚濁的滯水一樣，它是那樣澄淸，秀美：它有相當　深。上面架着一條木橋，橋板是用四根松幹來支撑着的。下面，正沙沙地響着，劃破了深夜的寂寥。突然松幹的二頭完全斷了，木板的兩端，裂成一條深痕，却還不曾坍下來。</p>
<p>「小明，工作差不多啦，呌大家去睡吧。記住！天不曾亮的五點鐘；還有，別忘了帶傢伙！」那邊正有人在命令着誰。一個老頭兒却躺在河邊的蘆叢裏，神往地望着新月：嘴角銜着旱烟筒。微白的簇烟，從蘆花間透出，還是那麽閒逸寗靜地。</p>
<p>「阿元，我們二十幾個人，幹他一小隊，就祇有這個辦法……呌他們在蘆叢裏，傢伙瞄準了，要是大車在前頭，打落水兔子，不用說。要是小車在前頭，則事可棘手啦！……噯；一不做，二不休，拚了我這老命不要了！」老頭兒的臉上抹着一層堅决的靑霜。</p>
<p>「是的，老爹。」那邊的人默默的注視着，雙手緊緊的像鐵般握着。</p>
<p>魚白的曙光，遠遠從東方照來，稀薄的白霜已微閃地披上了大地，掩飾着一切的汚濁與殘缺。</p>
<p>河邊蘆叢，草堆，起了一陣動亂後，又漸漸靜寂下來，六十老爹精神地抹了一下鼻涕，一手搭着阿元的肩膀：</p>
<p>「老弟，今天我們是有把握的，你聽喜鵲不是在向我們道喜嗎？哈哈……」</p>
<p>突然，一陣不斷的聲音，從遠處傳來，漸來漸響。一輛灰黃汽車的掄廓慢慢淸晰了起來。這裏情緒隨着緊張，充滿着火花的眼睛睜得偌大。</p>
<p>「同志們，鎭靜點！今天包成功，大汽車在前面呀！」雖然這夥人，對於戰事已有了相當的磨練，但阿元因為在領導的地位，防大家抑不住情感，所以關照這句話。</p>
<p>汽車已到了橋脚邊，滿車的鬼子宿着頭頸在抖，惶悚地把槍口瞄對着原野的四週。汽車又隆隆的駛上橋面。</p>
<p>「豁－！轟－！」</p>
<p>「拍！拍！拍！」蘆草叢內發出火星，淸澈的河水裏漾起紅暈。</p>
<p>小汽車「嘎」的一聲煞住了，迅捷的架起機關槍，槍口在無目的地怒號。</p>
<p>「小夥子，衝呀！那小車上的鬼官。」六十第一個竄出草堆，但却直直地倒了下去。後面的人羣，像潮水般直蓋過來。</p>
<p>「拍，拍拍拍……咯咯咯……」一應着步槍響，鬼子一個個地倒下去了，機關槍彈却仍向河邊的草堆和泥土上肆虐。</p>
<p>現在，靜寂了，阿元跑到六十老爹的身邊，看他靜靜地躺在那裏；碎斷的肚腸，捲拌着地上的土粒；却又張大了口腔，像在沈默地呼號着。阿元撲的跪下去，眼角掛着熱淚；「老爹，你是中國的父親，安靜的睡吧。孩子們是會從血的培養中長成的！」</p>
<h3>寃家路窄</h3>
<p>— 何</p>
<h3>僥倖，苟安，和平</h3>
<p>— 陳人</p>
<p>把數十年辛苦經營的精力作孤注一擲，以圖僥倖，這無疑地是自殺政策。强敵富前，不能奮起抵抗，祇圗苟安一時，這也就等於坐而待斃。</p>
<p>僥倖與苟安，原都是要不得的。然而世界上正多着貪圗僥倖的人們，而僥倖者惟一的希望，却正落在苟安者的身上。</p>
<p>然而世界上更多着貪圖苟安的份子，而苟安者的惟一希望，却原米是和平。</p>
<p>和平的基礎，原不是建染在苟安上面的。全世界愛好和平的人類，應該在鬥爭裏求生存，隨時與僥倖者以迎頭痛擊。如果以退讓求妥協，以妥協求苟安，以苟安求和平，那簡直是自取滅亡。</p>
<p>僥倖者張開了血嘴，眼見得把廣州，海南島，以及華南，一塊塊底吞噬下去；但苟安者還在憧憬着和平。然而和平在那裏呢？答覆的是一片炸彈，砲火的聲音，和整千萬無辜人民的血肉橫飛。</p>
<p>當和平絕望，苟安者的心理，失去其依據的時候，僥倖者的希望，也就免不了落空。待到擲下最後的孤注，眞正的和平的曙光，才得重現於世界。</p>
<h3>論「她媽的」（下）</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>查『她媽的』發生的背景，原來有這樣幾個世態而，這裏不能一網打盡；希望有志之士，在中國這塊大地上多多的盯她幾眼：</p>
<p>壓迫得透不過氣來；『吃壁』到牆也要倒下來的時候；欺凌得不像人樣；『她媽的』，行動！行動來了！『揭竿一呼』，呼的當然是『她媽的』；　『天下雲合而響應』，饗應的是那邊有一個『她媽的』也。，『裹糧而景從』，景從的當然是跟『她媽的』呼號而去！去，到地獄裏去造天堂！堅决地造成它！</p>
<p>怒吼了！我寫不完怒吼的各該塲面，我祇是知道從』『她媽的』吼出來一個中國翻過身來的起點，振奮而有為的萬丈光芒。這洪爐裏曾鑄成一個新的機件。不管你相信否，有事實證明。</p>
<p>我不能寫浮泛的文章，更不能不跟着『她媽的』時代而振臂一呼『她媽的』。至於所以能够成功『她媽的』的精神，不能不運用現成的來做注脚；</p>
<p>前綫傳來；『她媽的！幹掉！』</p>
<p>有些角落裏都在喊：『她媽的！出淸一下！淸算吧！』</p>
<p>後方傳來：『弄得家破人亡！她媽的！索性老命也不要！衝過去！』</p>
<p>有些還這樣：『竟是這樣的把戲！王道，道她媽的！有我沒有你！』</p>
<p>激昂的精神間更其都是：『拚掉！一不做！二不休！她媽的，』</p>
<p>這整齊的，響亮的，積極性的，壯偉的，結棍的，美而合理的聲音，把國民性刻了一條深闊的鴻溝，也把已往的那一切的一切，在這一聲『她媽的』之後，廢棄無餘。</p>
<p>瞧！『她媽的』所至之處，金石為開！</p>
<p>這精神，這劃時代的甘脆而爽快的精神，該是値得歌頌！我們對於『她媽的』敬祝前程萬里！更希望再發揮個淋漓盡致！翻開中國歷史的新頁！</p>
<p>人類求生存，民族求更生，已經令仗你鼓舞起一半的豐功偉烈了！相信抗戰必勝，就在眼前。然而求全責備，不能不搬出赤忱的心願，建國的時候，也還是要保持了這份積極性的新精神；</p>
<p>機構不對，不是民族利益的前提，不是建國上必需的村料，要你老實不客氣的『大展鴻圖』－『她媽的』推掉！一切推掉，合理的來！</p>
<p>這話是中國國民性轉變時期中的一個新基點嗎？</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>十　合浦鎭的陷落</p>
<p>儘管葉團長向兵士們反覆地訓話，呌他們要鎭靜，和敵人接觸時不要害怕，似因為事出倉猝，許多兵士也正和民衆一樣，剛從歡樂的新年中出來，就面對着戰神，一顆心無論怎樣安定不下；兼之敵機還在鎭上不斷的轟炸，民衆哭喊呼號不已，這一切都影響了前方的士氣，使得他們的鬥志無形中减低了不少。</p>
<p>然而最大的致命傷，還是部隊裹缺乏重砲。敵人的進攻却似乎是有計劃的，把各種重兵器，都利用了佔有的交通綫，運來向合浦鎭進攻。趙德勝大隊長率部在七里墩堵截，一連激戰了兩個鐘頭，援兵雖然源源不絕的開到，終因敵方的砲火過猛，為了避免無謂的犧牲起見，不得不撤退上來。</p>
<p>七里墩的陣綫一撤退，敵軍的前鋒便從東南面迫近了合浦鎭。埋伏在樹林裏的兵士，開始向敵軍射擊，應聲而殪的很不少。這里本是很好的一片掩護陣地，但在敵軍猛烈的砲火下，反而成了鮮明的目標，幾百磅重的榴霰彈，紛紛的向樹林裏直落，把樹木都連根拔將起來。葉團長只好下令把部隊都撤退過河去，並且親自用擲彈筒炸毀了河上那條唯一的小石橋。</p>
<p>於是便展開了驚心動魄的巷戰，在炸彈大砲輕重機關槍步槍的複雜交響下，濃烟和烈火的焚燒中，每個戰十都咬緊了牙關，沉着地躲在民戾裏，樹背後，河沿的樓房頂上，瞄準了敵軍射擊。敵軍因為河面並不寬廣，屢次企圖泅水衝過河來，都被我軍用機關槍掃射了回去，最後，他們的重兵器趕上來了，就利用那一片樹林作掩護，向隔河砲轟，在『蓬蓬』的重砲聲中，沿河一帶的民房，都被打得棟折榱崩，埋伏在裏面的戰士，都作了壯烈犧牲。葉團畏眼看這情形，知道無法再堅守下去，只好揮淚下令撤退，暫時讓自己的桑梓之鄉去受狼虎蹂躪。</p>
<p>撒退的命令下後，兵士們一面向對岸虛發着槍，一面緩緩的向北退去。但也有少數兵士，接到了命令，仍舊繼續射擊，寗死不退的。這樣，又和敵軍相持了一個鐘頭，直到太陽快要落山時，敵軍和獨眼李的土匪隊伍，纔算完成了他們的所謂『肅淸」工作。</p>
<p>葉團長雖然在敵機開始轟炸時就呌梁團附去通知民衆趕快逃難，可是因為突出意外，又在新年裹，誰都沒有準備，所以逃出來的人還不及全鎭人口的三分之一。（三二）</p>

<h3>活躍在戰地的　上海女警察</h3>
<p>— 洞天</p>
<p>差不多大家都知道的，在上海市南北車站，以及滬西和十六舖等地方服務過的女警們。穿着黑色中山裝的上身，圍着黑裙子，裹腿，登着皮鞋。走在路上都像我們男警一樣雄赳赳的。</p>
<p>她們一班有三十多個人，全都是有着健強的體格，至於學歷，有的還在過高上的學府呢，當時在打浦路的教練所裏，每天受着三講兩操的訓練，六個月後，她們都分派到各個分局裏去實習社會服務，我在北火車站曾常會到過她們，那時她們沒有一個不在勤謹的工作。至於她們因為搜到大量的烟土，或有的抄到幾枝手槍，而得局長的嘉獎，這更是常有的事。「八一三」事變的時候，她們還很鎮靜的在南市服務，並且在文局長的紀念碑前　斃過一個漢奸呢！</p>
<p>別小視了她們，胆子並不比男子小。我記得去年春天，她們十幾個人要到廣東去，不過經了一次的集議，便很毅勇的開步走了。到廣東順德縣時，臨時住在大良莊，沒有多久一個個都得到了事做。有幾位升任民團幹部裏的女教官，其餘的不是担任宣傳，就是勸募，工作的成績，都很驚人。有幾位家長曾去信要她們回來團衆，她們都回信拒絕。並　還說：「……國破家何在……救國須精神，豈可使男兒獨負責任嗎？」這一番話，真愧煞許多貪生怕死的男子呢！至於她們的近况，有一位來信說：「我們一行人有十多個，雖然工作不同，搬過許多的所在，可是永住在一起，永跟着國軍陣線進退。雖在腥風血雨裏度着生活，並沒有一點懼怕心理，」現在仍在反攻的部隊中，正等待着和敵人拼命的機會啦！</p>
<h3>殉節</h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>報載成都市內最近發生一可歌可泣之壯烈殉節情事。事實是這樣的：本年二月五日，中國空軍××大隊隊長劉福洪勇士，奉命命率機多架，前往山西運城，轟炸日機塲，於投下炸彈百餘枚，炸毀日機四十餘架，任務完成後，正擬遄返原地，不意飛抵臨潼時，以天氣惡劣，雲霧太重，竟致迷失歸路，強迫降落，重傷殞命。這不幸的消息傳到劉勇士新婚的愛妻陳影凡女士的耳中，先服毒自殺，幸經人發覺，送醫院救活，然女士伉儷之情極為濃厚，殉情之念仍未打消，因此復乘人不備，潛取手槍自戕，傷中要害，畢竟成全了他的殉節的意念。陳女士這種對丈夫，深厚的愛情而為報紙所稱為壯烈的殉情，實在是太使人感動了。</p>
<p>不過，我們對陳女士的「殉節」，雖然萬分的悼惜，然而，我們也實在不敢贊同她這樣的幹法。</p>
<p>「殉節」本是我們封建時代的所謂「婦德」，它實在是男性中心社會對弱小的婦女大衆的一種殘忍的「酷刑」。一個女人嫁給了男人，她就傷失了她的一切，非但她的肉身，而連她靈魂精神，亦不為她所有了。古時候，東方有些民族的帝王如果死了，那末他的后以及他的妃子，都得殉節，因此在千百年之後，我們的地質學家發掘地殻的時候，還能够無意間找出「封穴」中的「木乃伊」來，這可說是最為典型的例子了。其他，如「貞節牌坊」，只要我們一回到鄉下去，是比比皆是。我們一些偽道德家，搖着頭對「貞節牌坊」贊歏的時候，他們的嘴角邊正在噴濺出血沫來哩。</p>
<p>可是這種封建野人男人對女人的「酷刑」，在婦女們的腦際中，却打下了牢不可破的基礎，而把它當作一種「美德」，而悲哀地犧牲了一己，讓一些偽道德家噴濺着血沫來搖頭贊歏，這是我們中國婦女大衆的一種不幸，一種悲慘！在這抗戰建國的大熔爐裏，我們是要像對付敵人一樣來對付這種「酷刑」，廓清婦女大衆腦隙中這種傷失自己沒有人性的毒害的意識的！</p>
<p>現在是婦女朋她們自己的獨立和人性的時代，她們也是社會和國家組成的一員，因此，對社會和國家，她們也有了她們應盡的義務，和應享的權利—「殉節」不是一個現代婦女的一種「美德」了，而是相反，是現代婦女的一種「惡德」！</p>
<p>因此，陳影凡女士不應對他的丈夫劉福洪勇士殉節。劉勇士旣已為國捐軀了，那末陳女士正應該為着國仇私恨，向着我們的民族敵人更加百千倍地提起鬥爭的精神來，去索取她的血債！</p>
<p>然而陳影凡女士是畢竟殉節了，這並不是她的錯誤，這是舊時代的殘餘殺害了她。陳女士的「殉節」，又暴露了舊時代的「惡蹟」之一，我們的抗戰，連同敵人一起，會掃除舊時代的殘餘的！中國的婦女大衆們！起來吧！</p>

<h3>「化身人猿」觀感</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>新華出品　中聯發行　金城開映</p>
<p>失戀，失業，一般青年都為這當前的兩大問題所苦悶着。「化身人猿」中的白劍平，就受了有力者的壓迫，失業了，同時失戀了，他像無數的青年一樣，被這兩大問題所煎迫着而胡太太却看準了這個機會，憑藉着她的美色和金錢，想攫取這青年底純潔的靈魂。白劍平感到這是可忍，孰不可忍的侮辱；但在他憤怒，煩悶交迫的時候，他怎樣去克服自己（也是大多數的青年）當前的危難呢？「化身人猿」的劇作者是投合了一般小市民層的幻想復仇，白劍平就在「感其無可留戀之人生，毅然作一度之試騐」的决定下，注射了毒液，他化身了人猿，在野性勃發的時候，去侮辱胡太太，給予他憎恨的人以報復。但是這種幻想的復仇方法，也像一般青年在理智清醒的時候一樣，他感到「慚愧恨惡，大受良心上的譴責，」在胡太太來訪會他的時候，他安慰她，並歸還他攫奪的錢財，並立即把毒液送到研究室，「决定不再試用」。但第二個打擊跟着又來了，使他失戀，失業的張玄生即將和他的愛人結婚，並且也侮辱了他。「經此刺激，」白劍平的理智又幻滅了，「覺此混濁的世界，祇有野獸行動，可對付一切，」於是他又注射毒液，化身人猿，這時候他不但襲擊他憎恨的胡太太和張玄生，他甚至憎惡全人類，他侮辱每個他遇見的女人，並撕毀鈔票。這樣的結果，在他被擊身死的時候，祇落得佩琳廉價的同情：「他是被環境弄成這個樣子的。」是的，每一個青年，甚至每一個中國人，都被惡劣的環境所壓迫着，而且是超過了失戀，失業以上的。在這樣險惡的環境中求生存，是需要不斷的努力，爭鬥，去粉碎惡勢力的梏桎，喟歏，同情是無補於事實的，或許會遭致更可怕的結果呢！</p>
<p>談到攝製恐怖片，我們毋庸諱言是敵不過好萊塢的，如本片人猿出現時的恐怖氣氛都顯得不够，劍平化身時也不能利用燈光或音响來加強緊張的空氣。但導演者也有他努力的地方，如白劍平失業後，利用急噪的琴聲來陪親他內心的煩悶；劍平在研究室中遇見張玄生時：先是張玄生的聲音，接一個張玄生的近景，他的背後正是人猿的模型，一方面顯示張玄生的可怕，同時給劍平以刺激，使他再次注射毒液，以遂報復之願。</p>
<p>王引的人猿演得很認真，最好的是佩琳來告訴張玄生將移地結婚的那塲戲，在他非常苦痛的時候，自己的毒疾又將發作，他拿手槍交給佩琳，要她過到危急作為目衛之用，倒到沙發上化身時，內心的苦痛和毒液發作的苦痛底交併，是演得非常逼真的。</p>
<p>本片的收音較為糢糊，光綫也灰黯了一點。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖</p>
<p>她們飯後也不敢多耽擱，便送吳君素回到她的學校裏。原來這座東吳大學校，是中美合辦的。以各科併計起來，大學生共有八千多人。只有文科，醫科，理科，是設大蘇州。此外一個法學院，仍舊設在上海。一個農學院，却是設在崑山。一個工學院，便是設在無錫。還有十二座附屬中學，常州，宜興，太倉，常熟，松江，嘉定，到處皆有。大中學生併算起來，共有二萬多人。這裏頭，不但是中國學生，而且也有外國學生。外國學生中，自然以美國人為多，但也有英國人，法國人，德國人，暹羅，印度，菲列濱人。統計有百分之三是外國人，其餘都是中國人。教師中，倒有十分之三是外國人，其餘是中國人，但這十分之三中，也是美國人佔多數了。朱愛人急匆匆的送吳君素回到東吳大學裏，恐怕她脫了課，幸虧到了那邊，時候尚早。吳君素又想引領何家兩位小姐在學校裏各處參觀參觀。朱愛人道：『算了吧！你們這個學校，隨便各處走走，就要半天工夫。只好過一天，再來請教吧！不然，醫學院裏我也有兩位朋友，也來不及去訪問他們了。」吳君素也因為自己有課，不及招待，便說：「那末朱醫師和兩位姊姊，倘然來時，務必通知我一信。我沒有招待兩位姊姊，很為抱歉。再者，我們文學院裏，有個戲劇研究會，他們一年要公演幾回戲。這一次獻演期近了，但還沒有定日子。到了那一天，我送劵來，請你們來看戲。我還要去約澹雲也來咧，你們務必要來。」何家兩位小姐都道：「一定來！一定來！」吳君素是一位最喜歡朋友的人，她和雙玉儷玉兩人，雖不過半日的盤桓，却覺得氣誼相投，是兩位愛好的伴侶了。此時暫別，也有依依不捨之狀。朱愛人送了吳君素到學校後，在車子裏，　和何家兩位小姐相商道：『兩位姊姊，你們老實說：你們這回，還是住到我們醫院裏去呢？還是住到我祖父那邊的自由村去？住在醫院裏，不免嘈雜些，到自由村去，却是清靜安逸得多。但我為醫務所阻，却不能天天到自由村來，這是「椿憾事呢。」正是　月榭雲樓隨客住，山村水郭迓君來。（六〇）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>遊藝界與救難運動</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>救濟難民，這是人人所應負的責任，應盡的義務。遊藝界同人，不但不能例外，而且，更該盡最大的努力，為各界的先導。關於這，遊藝界同人，似乎已經正在展開他們的任務了。例如上海難民救濟協會市民組遊藝廣播委員會的首次常務委員會議，一致議决，集合全市遊藝廣播界同人，繼續努力，協助救難工作之進行。這誠然是一種良好的現象；然而，在我看來，遊藝界的救難運動，如果僅僅由廣播同人，單獨努力，其成效還是不能普遍而顯著。我們應該集合整個上海市遊藝界的從業員，不論屬於電影的，話劇的，說書的，播音的，戲劇的，舞塲的，……大家需要一致的聯合起來，站在一條戰綫上，共同來努力一下大規模的遊藝界的救難運動。除了每個遊藝員，應該佩一枚申報館捐贈的「樂善章」外，還要勸導自己的親友，節約生活上無謂的浪費，走到一條「為善最樂」的路上去。因為我們節省二元錢，可以教一個難胞，享受一學期的生產教育，學習一種謀生的技能，在我行之甚易，而難胞們，却受惠無窮了。這種切實有效的救難運動，遊藝界同人的確應該負起偉大的責任，來竭力推進的。</p>
<p>筆者十二萬分的希望，每個遊藝從業員，在本身業務上，儘可能的「動人為善」，發揮難民生產教育的意義，使大衆在遊藝界同志領導之下，使「無家可歸」「有家歸不得」的孤島十萬難民，得到謀生的技能，解决生活的難題，那真是一件功德無量的事。</p>
<h3>漫談新聞片</h3>
<p>— 呆子</p>
<p>歐美新事件一兩月可在上海放映　攝影師像新聞記者須得眼快手快</p>
<p>西班牙戰事中巴塞維納的失陷，智利的地震，以及羅馬教皇的逝世，這些事件，都發生在最近的一兩個月之中。但關於這些事件的新聞片，前個星期之中，我們在上海的電影院裏，已可看見了。不明底蘊的人，會疑惑到這種新聞片，攝製和運送，有這樣的神速，是否有特殊的微妙。</p>
<p>其實新聞片的製作和公映，有如此的神速，要歸功於天空有飛機的通航。攝影師把新事件攝入境頭之後，用航空投遞，寄回公司，而影片公司趕快的中洗，和剪接成功之後，又用航空機運往世界各大都市。凡是事件較大，富有新聞價值的新聞片，都用這種方法製作和運送的。</p>
<p>好萊塢的影片公司，規模比較大些的，都特設攝製新聞片的部分，內中更以福斯影片公司，對新聞片的拍攝，特別重視。他們在世界各地，特別是國都和大都市裏，都派有常駐的攝影師。這樣某一個都市中，發生了必然的，或偶然的新事件，便可攝入鏡頭，把底片寄回公司，加以整理和剪接，製成整卷的新聞片。</p>
<p>凡是偶發的事件，像大火燒，地震，水災，火山爆裂等，事前都不知道，出於偶然。所以事件發生，得到消息之後，攝影師馬上去攝影，原是出於意料，得之偶然。至於必然的事件，如各種紀念儀式，盛大集會，閱兵典禮，海陸軍大演習等，事前早已得到消息，到了日期，便可帶了攝影機，走去攝影。</p>
<p>固定的事件，拍攝新聞片時，有時在新聞的價值方面，每會因發生變化而伸縮。譬如某日國王參加閱兵典禮，親自檢閱軍隊。攝影師事前早已得到消息，到了那天，帶了攝影機，預備去攝影，可是臨時發生變化，國王因抱病或別種關係而不能出席，派代表檢閱，那麼所攝得的新聞片，價值使降低了。同樣的事件，在舉行閱兵禮時發生國王被人暗殺或撞車慘案　衆暴動等所攝的影片價值是增高了意外的收獲，為攝影師事前所沒有知道的。</p>
<p>一個攝影師，如果專門拍攝新聞片，除了須具有攝影技巧而外，更須熟知新聞學。在一個新事件中，某幾個鏡頭不可漏去，某幾個鏡頭可以放棄，某一個鏡頭要用特寫的攝法。兩個攝影師，同攝一件新聞，結果有不同的成就，好壞就看攝影的技巧，在新聞學的觀點上，取舍有何不同。總之，一個拍攝新聞片的攝影師，正和新聞記者一樣，須有靈敏的頭腦，眼快手快，攝別人所攝不到的鏡頭，才算傑出呢！</p>
<h3>信手拈來</h3>
<p>— 知白</p>
<p>楊　　君，在本刋作醇酒廬劇話，謂閻世善為閻嵐秋（九陣風之子，實誤。世善為嵐秋弟嵐亭之子，亦非朱四十（文英）之外孫，惟世善之藝，實得嵐秋之親授，故能繼傳乃伯之衣缽，而能駕乎宋德珠朱盛富輩之上，為後起武旦行中最佳之一人也。</p>
<p>武旦之下靶（即下手）較武生尤為重要，蓋武旦戲多重於出手，設下靶稍差，則出手難見精彩也，今之名武旦，如九陣風朱桂芳輩，其下靶皆為有名人物，閻世善之父嵐亭，昔即為九陣風之下靶，與九陣風合演盜仙草，取金陵諸劇，一搭一擋，其出手之精彩，極蓋牡丹綠葉之妙。朱桂芳之下靶，為朱湘泉，與桂芳亦昆仲行，善演泗洲城之行者，亦武行中之佼佼者。</p>
<p>「十字坡」戲中之孫二娘，亦武旦應行戲，武松同為劇中主角，蓋呌天早年演此，輒由祁彩芬配孫二娘，祁為江南武旦祭酒，與蓋五演此，誠有天衣無縫之妙。蓋五退休後，祁改為張翼鵬配戲，前次蓋五再起東山，出演更新，欲覓一武旦人才，煞費苦心。雖有周菊芳之加入，但周固非上駟之才，者番蓋五再度出演，乃邀得水上飄合作。水上飄難與祁彩芬相較，但經騐資望與祁不相上下，較周菊芳終勝一籌也。</p>
<p>江南武旦人才較北方尤少，已成寥若晨星之局面，能為人重視者，百不得一。僅一坤伶粉菊花，曾經撐過一番市面，惟今之粉菊花，其藝已退化，更因人老珠黃，已不為世人所重。甚至淪為羣屏山之英兒，故以實際而論，江南簡直已無一十全十美之武旦人才矣。</p>
<p>童星葉小珠，是露茜的弟弟，趙丹的小舅子，「木蘭從軍」中大聲說着：「姐姐你要是打不過那些傢伙，只要寫信回來，我就去帮你的忙！」的就是他。「化身人猿」中他也飾一角色，看來是頗有希望的孩子。</p>

<h3>歌塲潦倒一龜年</h3>

<p>近在時代劇塲與張文娟為配之老伶工盧慶元，王長林之得意弟子也，燕京菊部中名武丑，早年允推德子杰（都人呼以麻德子）為最。德之後則張黑與王長林堪稱二難，夏月恒亦有名，張黑武技遠勝長林而病怯口，長林武藝略遜而獨以道白爽脆見長，張黑長林月恒以外，當數傅小山盧慶元艾雲飛岳春林王福山諸人，後進中今且推葉盛章為出色當行矣。盧慶元師事長林，凡長林之所能者，慶元爢不能之。民國三四年間，愚客故都，時常見其出演於文明園，與俞振庭贊廷昆仲為配，白口乾脆勝傅小山，緣小山念白時患氣急也。後以事不為師母所喜，（長林之妻）慶元性固執，决絕離京，臨行告至好曰：師父不死，吾不返京也；離京來滬，在海上稱第一武丑者歷若干年，凡南來名鬚生之演打漁殺家者，咸以得慶元去教師爺一角為懽，慶元是劇之白口，與王長林所念，不失累黍，神氣架子亦逼肖乃師，一度與蓋呌天合演三叉口，亦復有聲於時，後以染嗜好，體氣日衰，武工亦退，某年楊小樓來滬，曾親訪慶元，告以長林時以為念，託小樓旋京時偕返舊京，慶元婉言却之。又若干年，慶元以私事擬作歸計，適有名伶來滬，謂慶元曰：汝老師正抱病在京，慶元雖以長林為念，亟思北歸一見教師，又恐在其北歸之時，萬一長林謝世，其師母或且有不利於彼之言，遂决計留滬。迨長林逝世後，楊小樓又來函促其北上，此時雖感小樓盛誼，而自　體力已衰，即使返京，一旦登台，實已無復當年活躍　毺之精神，不得已遂覆函謝之。今王長林楊小樓均　不已拱，而慶元亦　垂老矣。以慶元早年負氣之盛，又豈曾料及今日潦倒於時代歌塲者哉？前數年間，海上陳庸菴老人每年夏間，必有盛大常會，主其事者為江紫誠先生，必召留滬諸老伶工如瑞德寶張榮奎盧慶元諸人，一顯身手，如此盛况，今日不復得再見矣。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一一九）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>連環套是武戲中的羣戲</p>
<p>天覇一聽，真是愧悔萬分，心中說不出的難過。幸有一位計全老大哥在旁邊暗示於他，呌他向朱大哥磕頭賠禮。光祖見他認罪服輸，遂也怒氣全消，並且以誠意勸戒他道「嗣後你這個副將大人的脾氣，還要少發一些。」如此一來，彼此更能洞悉各人的心性；而天覇又勇於改過，當然交情益加親厚了。反觀現在的人，十九都是見利忘義，有害則惟恐避之不及，那有幾個像朱光祖這樣的人，甘願瞞着衆人，自己先把事情辦成功啦，真正替朋友帮了忙啦，然後才使朋友知道他的心意。晚近社會裏先講吹牛，事情半點影響沒有，却吹得怎樣怎樣，等到真正朋友要用着他啦，他又推三阻四，縮回頭去。這樣看起來，真還不如以前的綠林中人，尚懂得義氣二字。我個人的性情，很歡喜交朋友，不過覺得如今的朋友却是極不易交的，因為現在都把個「交」字改成「利用」兩字了。利用只是一時的，或一次兩次，彼此利用過啦，交情就此完結。故而我每逢看到「連環套」「銅綱陣」這一類戲，就發生一種感慨。新生活中禮義廉恥的義字，固然包括很廣，然而「交友尚義」這四個字，當然也是包括其中的，許多人看「連環套」觀點全灌注在寶黃兩人身上，而我個人的私見，却極欽佩朱光祖的見義勇為，思慮周密。他暗中一想當年他們的黃三叔（三太）武藝超羣，以他那樣的本領，李家店比武時尚險些敗在寶爾墩的手裏；要不是他改變素來不打暗鑣的宗旨，暗放甩頭一支，打傷了寶爾墩的左膀，恐怕十有八九要失敗的。天覇的本領，旣非其父可比，而寶爾墩為報當年一鑣之仇，定必鍊功甚勤，雖是近來年歲略大了些，但是他是有名的「鐵羅漢」，不似別的採花淫賊，年邁氣衰，武功退化。天覇如其不能取勝，就得實踐替父認罪的諾言。</p>

<h3>Bombing of Leizhou and Lianzhou Tightens Situation in Southern Guangdong; Hong Kong Military Authorities Strengthen Defenses; New Military Zones Established; Large Warships and Aircraft Stationed; British Fleet Conducts Drills Simulating Attack on Singapore; Hubei's Chinese Army Recaptures Yangzi Town</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong military authorities have decided recently to designate Aberdeen (Hong Kong Tsai) and Ap Lei Chau as military zones. Several large warships and numerous aircraft will be stationed there to defend Hong Kong. Defense works in that area are being urgently constructed with a deadline for completion. The British fleet in China and the Eastern Indian Ocean fleet, consisting of twenty-five cruisers, destroyers, submarines, aircraft, frigates, and other ships, will conduct drills this month simulating an attack on Singapore to test the port's defenses. The ships departed from southern Hong Kong, arrived in full on the 17th, and will begin the drills immediately. (Special dispatch, 8:00 PM, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Jingmen reports that Japanese troops on the Jingmen-Yichang and Hankou-Yichang-Jingzhong (toward Zhongxiang) routes, as well as those in Tianmen and Yuekou, are currently adopting a defensive posture. Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting in areas such as Changshou Town, north of Zhongxiang. Japanese troops on the Hua-Xiang (Huaibei-Xiangfan) Road are attempting to invade Suixian and Zaoyang counties, but the Chinese army has strengthened its defenses. (Special dispatch, 9:00 PM, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Leizhou was again heavily bombed by Japanese planes on the 11th. Bombs hit the French Catholic Church and the train station. Lianzhou was bombed on the afternoon of the 12th, with fourteen bombs hitting the urban area, leaving rubble everywhere, resulting in two deaths and eight injuries. Japanese troops in Guangzhou are busy moving east, with intentions to attack Huizhou, Zengcheng, and Boluo. Japanese troops in Xijiang are frantically building fortifications everywhere, and the southern route is also tense. Japanese troops in Luohanling, Liushuigou, and Changshou Town, north of Zhongxiang, are all retreating south, attempting to spy on the Xiang River south of Zhongxiang. The Chinese army has strengthened its defenses. (Special dispatch, 10:00 PM, 13th)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The remaining Japanese troops in Zhongxiang are currently building fortifications, seemingly intending to hold their ground. Japanese troops who previously fled to the vicinity of Changshou Town were routed after being met by the Chinese army. The Chinese army followed up and pursued, and Yangzi Town (approximately ten kilometers north of Zhongxiang) was also recaptured by the Chinese army. The Chinese army is continuing its advance. There has been no increase or decrease in Japanese troops on the Hankou-Yichang road. A large amount of materials has been transported recently, suggesting an attempt to cross the river. (Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Yicheng: The Japanese troops that invaded Zhongxiang are currently building fortifications to defend against a counterattack. On the opposite bank of the Yang River, artillery battles across the river with the Chinese army have occurred intermittently over the past two days. Japanese troops in Anlu, Binhe, Sanyangdian, and other places are reorganizing, with no other movements yet. (Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Japanese troops in northern Hunan have been frequently redeploying in recent days. Japanese motorboats on Dongting Lake have been very active recently, causing the situation in northern Hunan to become tense again. Yesterday, more than ten Japanese motorboats sailed from the northwest of Junshan Island, attempting to raid Huarong, but were repelled by the Chinese army. Three Japanese motorboats were sunk by the Chinese army. (Express News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangzhou: Japanese troops in Humen are continuing to reinforce Shilu, Zengcheng, and other places, apparently planning a large-scale eastward offensive. Japanese troops in Zengcheng have repeatedly attempted to spy on Longmen to the north and attack Boluo to the east, but have been repelled by the Chinese army.

<h3>Thousand Japanese Troops Enter Hengshui, Over Three Hundred Eliminated; Lu Zhonglin Admires the Eighth Route Army and the People's Automatic Assistance to the Army</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a merchant from Hengshui County in central Hebei, who arrived here today, about one thousand Japanese troops invaded Hengshui County in mid-February to carry out so-called "purge" operations against Chinese guerrillas. However, by the first week of March, more than three hundred of the Japanese troops there had been eliminated by the Chinese side. After occupying Hengshui County, the Japanese troops sent teams to garrison nearby villages and towns, but the Japanese casualties in these villages and towns were at least five hundred. Furthermore, the Japanese casualties were not the result of any major battles with the Chinese army, but rather the result of attacks suffered by small teams of Japanese troops while searching for guerrillas in various villages and towns. On average, each small-team search by the Japanese army resulted in fifteen casualties. Little by little, the Japanese army was gradually eliminated by the Chinese army. Furthermore, according to the merchant, Hengshui County was originally guarded by the troops of General Lu Zhonglin. When the Japanese army invaded Hengshui, the Chinese army ordered all residents to carry out intelligence gathering and trench digging. The purpose of these trenches was to prevent the Japanese mechanized units from advancing, but these trenches were useless because the narrow trenches were not difficult for Japanese tanks to cross, and the wide and deep trenches could be covered by Japanese machine guns, protecting the engineering teams engaged in filling the trenches. However, before the fall of Hengshui County, nine-tenths of the residents evacuated. According to the merchant, General Lu is amiable and loved by all. Although General Lu is wealthy, he admires the Eighth Route Army immensely, because the troops of General Lu must issue orders to the people before the people will respond and work, but the Eighth Route Army has explained clearly to the people what actions they should take in certain situations, so in times of emergency, they can often automatically assist the army's actions.

<h3>The Future of the War of Resistance Has Shown Brightness: A Conversation with a Certain Director</h3>
<p>A certain place: A Central News Agency reporter visited a certain director in charge of a certain meeting one morning to inquire about the achievements of the meeting. The director was in the process of saying goodbye to the representatives, instructing and admonishing them with a warm and sincere spirit. He then accepted the conversation. Although the director had been working hard for several days, his attitude was still particularly excited and happy. After the reporter paid his respects, he asked a few questions. The director first said that the only achievement of this meeting was the unprecedented unity and strength in spirit. The sincere situation of each representative frankly expressing the difficulties they had experienced since the war was surprising and touching. A sense of loyalty and responsibility for life was evident here. The director continued that in terms of the war of resistance against Japan, the meeting had a firm and resolute countermeasure in the active aspect. It was decided that for the past twenty months in the active aspect, we had been fighting in blood and had strategically laid the foundation for a protracted war of resistance and had gained the initiative. We must support this great foundation and step up the steps to attack the Japanese side. Therefore, in addition to showing precise tactics of a full-scale active war, the meeting also decided to bring back to the troops in front of and behind the Japanese people with the spirit of death and fight a national bloody battle. In recent times, the Japanese people have been using military intimidation methods to cover up the implementation of poisonous political methods and to promote insidious economic plans. For this reason, the meeting specifically decided on a plan to eliminate the Japanese people's poisonous attempts. In the military, we must bravely defeat the Japanese main force, and at the same time, we must crush the Japanese people's political tricks by implementing the National Covenant method. Then, in terms of economics and blockade, we must not allow Japanese goods to be transported into the mainland, nor allow our food products to be transported into the Japanese-occupied areas, so that their economic sources will be exhausted and their economic life will be trapped in the mud of a dead city. In the passive aspect, we will focus on consolidating various political and cultural forces in order to cooperate with the overall revolutionary tactics. Politically, we will decide to strengthen political institutions at all levels and consolidate the revolutionary regime in the war zone in order to launch the greatest popular force for resistance. Culturally, we will decide to strengthen the cultural work of resistance and promote the national spirit in order to enhance the revolutionary spirit. In terms of personnel, we will decide to follow personnel laws and regulations, select talents and appoint people, and in terms of management, we will decide to follow management laws and regulations, be honest and serve the public. Finally, we will formulate simple and effective steps for leading, training, and using troops. The reporter asked about the current state of our attack on Japan. The director said in a firm tone that we are now using a certain place as the center of gravity, with a certain place on the left wing and a certain place on the right wing as two major important strongholds, using strong forces to encircle and attack the Japanese people. At the same time, we will distribute troops in Ji-Jin-Cha-Sui (Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan) and the Pinghan (Beiping-Hankou) and Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) lines, expanding the area and responding to each other with wolf pack tactics and mobile warfare, so that the front and rear are in sync in suppressing Japan, moving towards a direction of renewal and progress. Now, the future of our war of resistance has shone with infinite victory. (Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Magistrate of Tongzi County, Kong Fumin, Commended by Order of Chairman Chiang; Feng Yuxiang Found Out and Telegraphed, Has Telegraphed the Chairman of Guizhou Province to Follow Suit</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang, according to a telegram from Committee Member Feng Yuxiang stating that he passed through Tongzi, learned that the county magistrate, Kong Fumin, was a promising young man who had been in office for four months and had shown good performance in governance and achievements, and that all measures were targeted at the crux of the problem and were determined to reform, was deeply gratified. He sent a telegram to Chairman Wu of the Guizhou Provincial Government, ordering him to commend him. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Chairman Wu of the Guizhou Provincial Government: Received telegram No. 10 from Committee Member Huanzhang Feng, which said, roughly, that on the 19th of last month, I passed through Tongzi and learned that the county magistrate, Kong Fumin, was a promising young man who had been in office for four months, and that both his governance spirit and achievements were good. Now, I will speak of his outstanding points. From the county magistrate to the public service staff, the food is uniform, but the food costs are shared according to the proportion of wages, so the county magistrate's monthly food expenses are more than 30 yuan, while the public service staff only share 5 jiao. Staff hold a symposium once a week to review their work, exchange experience, criticize each other, and introduce model work and actions. After the flag is raised every morning, all staff run along the city or climb mountains for about half an hour and then gather, regardless of their position, to give a ten-minute speech in turn. In the four months since taking office, he has made three inspections, visiting the people to understand their suffering and investigating the pros and cons of governance, either punishing corrupt officials or promoting promising young people. In particular, he adjusted the household donations in various places. The household donations in Guizhou are set up for the district security expenses and have always been directly collected by the baojia chiefs, but the baojia chiefs are mostly unsound, resulting in many abuses and causing the people the greatest suffering. Since County Magistrate Kong took office, he has carefully investigated the actual income of each household, stipulated the donation standards, and swept away past abuses, which not only eliminated the people's alienation from the government, but also made it easier to implement government laws and regulations, and thereby reduced the burden on the people, and the banditry was also eliminated. In terms of conscription, not only does he investigate, but he also encourages the people to file lawsuits, and in addition to urging the baojia chiefs to mobilize local people to help cultivate the land, he also allows the family members of soldiers on expeditions to owe taxes and not return them temporarily. Other measures are also able to target the crux of the problem and are determined to reform. In the past few months, I have seen that the local officials are striving to make progress, and those like the county magistrate are still rare. According to this, the various points mentioned show that the county magistrate of Tongzi County, Kong Fumin, is energetic, hardworking, and self-disciplined, and is able to set an example himself, supervising his subordinates, going deep into the people, and relieving their suffering. He is really deeply versed in political essentials and should be commended by order to show encouragement for honesty and ability. I hope you will follow suit and give special assessment and encouragement. Zhongzheng Yuan. (Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Spain and Its Lessons</h3>
<p>Spain truly staged a tragedy. This tragedy does not lie in the loss of Barcelona, nor in the intensified offensive of Italian and German fascists, nor in the recognition of Franco by Britain and France. The greatest tragedy of Spain was the coup in Madrid on March 6, which greatly divided the internal forces of the Spanish government. In this coup, Negrín, who resolutely led the war of resistance, was forced to step down; the newly formed National Defense Committee extended a hand of seeking peace to Franco; comrades-in-arms who had shared weal and woe for more than two years were expelled one after another; and Miaja, who had a glorious battle reputation in the past, actually played the role of the protagonist in the coup. Although they said they were seeking "honorable peace," in front of the conqueror, "honorable peace" never exists. In front of the conqueror, there is only "unconditional surrender." In fact, even though Spain is in a difficult situation today, it still has a basis for continuing the war of resistance. It still owns a quarter of the central region of the country; it has more than seven million loyal people; it has more than 500,000 brave and elite troops. Therefore, as long as the Spanish government is determined and united internally, it is fully sufficient to deal with its enemies on these foundations, and things are "very promising." However, at the most difficult and urgent juncture of the war of resistance, under the collusion with the rebels, Casado and his like forced Negrín away and advocated negotiating peace with Franco, which obviously only weakened their internal strength and gave the enemy the opportunity to attack, which is really the most heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in the world who loves Spain.</p>
<p>Although Casado and his like made a request to Franco for peace talks, how did Franco respond? Franco said: "We will never change our original position due to the new events in Madrid, and we should still prepare for military action.... Unless the government army is willing to surrender unconditionally, the National Army will never stop attacking Madrid!" (Haitong telegram on the 8th) If unconditional surrender can be said to be "honorable peace," then, wouldn't the thirty months of arduous struggle be unnecessary? Wouldn't the blood of more than one million people and soldiers be shed in vain? Therefore, after the National Defense Committee issued a call for peace, it immediately aroused the opposition of the Spanish people. The Communist Party took the lead, and Madrid was in a state of chaos for days. To be honest, thirty months of cruel battle experience have injected the blood of "hatred" into every Spanish person. They hate fascists, and they are determined not to be conquered. "Even if it is temporarily suppressed, a civil war will still break out in six months" (American "Nation Weekly").</p>
<p>The main reason for this coup in Madrid was obviously due to the wavering of Casado and others towards the war of resistance. They were short-sighted. They saw the difficulties in the future of the war of resistance and did not know how to further strengthen unity with friendly parties to cope with the great enemy, but instead thought of betraying friendly parties to seek the enemy's forgiveness. They heard the enemy shouting "anti-communist" and really thought that as long as they were "anti-communist," they could achieve "honorable peace." Little did they know that in today's world, denouncing the most loyal comrades-in-arms is equivalent to cutting off one's own hands and feet in front of the enemy!</p>
<p>Naturally, Premier Negrín should also be responsible for failing to prevent this coup in advance. After the fall of Barcelona, Negrín ran to France for a few days, giving the coup plotters the opportunity to arrange things. Here, we can't help but think of Chairman Chiang rushing back to Chongqing after the fall of Wuhan. If Chairman Chiang had not rushed back to Chongqing at that time, maybe Wang Zhaoming would have done something in Chongqing, which is another great place where Chairman Chiang's insights are outstanding and his handling of affairs is meticulous.</p>
<p>Secondly, from this coup, we can also clearly see the attitude of Britain and France. According to the Havas telegram on the 6th, "The collapse of the Spanish Negrín cabinet was long expected by diplomatic circles here." The Paris Echo also said, "Casado sent representatives to France to contact the Spanish President who resigned, the French government, and representatives of the British Embassy." The London Times said more clearly, "Miaja's formation of the cabinet is a step towards peace.... The surrender of a minority to a majority cannot be regarded as a dishonorable act." From the above points, the relationship between Britain and France and this coup is self-evident.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the Spanish tragedy may also arouse the doubts of some people who do not know enough about the Chinese war of resistance, thinking that the Spanish tragedy may be re-enacted in China. This kind of "alarmist" observation is obviously due to the failure to recognize the different conditions possessed by China and Spain. Therefore, we may as well give a brief explanation here: First, although the Spanish war of resistance and the Chinese war of resistance are both wars against fascist aggression, they have formal differences. The Spanish war of resistance broke out in the form of a "civil war," while the Chinese war of resistance is a war of the entire nation against foreign aggression. Therefore, the foundation of the People's Front supporting the Spanish war of resistance is obviously not as broad as the foundation of the Chinese national united front. In Spain, the "Spanish Falange," "Spanish Renaissance Society," and the Spanish Right-Wing Party Alliance (C.E.D.A.), which represent the interests of the aristocracy, landlords, and big capitalists, are almost all attached to Franco's banner; the Chinese national united front, except for traitors, includes all the people from capitalists to workers. Moreover, in Spain, the parties are extremely complex. A part of the anarchist members are still following the Trotskyite, Ning, and Mao Lin-led "Marxist Unification Party" (P.O.U.M.) to oppose the government's national policy of resistance; the Chinese national united front, under the sincere cooperation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, has been as solid as a rock and is still being strengthened. To be more specific, Spain has Franco, who has armed forces, while China at most only has Wang Zhaoming, who is like a "damp firecracker" and can't even speak loudly.</p>
<p>Second, the international environments of Spain and China are different. Spain's hands were bound by the "non-interference" rope from the beginning, while China's international assistance is only increasing day by day. This is because Britain and France are in a difficult situation in Europe, fearing being dragged into the vortex, and would rather sacrifice Spain. Moreover, in the Far East, there is also the "Siberian Bear" and the "Big Stick" Roosevelt, which makes Britain and France know that they must maintain their interests in the Far East and only support China.</p>
<p>Third, the territory of Spain cannot be compared with that of China. The area of ​​Spain is 196,607 square miles, and the territory of China is 2,903,475 square miles, a difference of almost eleven times (see World Almanac L939). China's vast territory and abundant resources are the basis for a protracted war, which is naturally much more advantageous than Spain.</p>
<p>The above points illustrate that the conditions possessed by China are more favorable than those of Spain in any aspect. The tragedy of Spain will never be re-enacted in China.</p>
<p>However, the lessons of the Spanish tragedy are worth remembering and experiencing deeply by China in the war of resistance:</p>
<p>First, constantly consolidating unity is the key to a protracted war of resistance. To consolidate unity, we must always pay attention to the existence of compromising and wavering elements in the anti-Japanese camp and eliminate all compromising and wavering remarks.</p>
<p>Second, adhering to independent and autonomous diplomacy is also the key to winning the final victory. It is necessary to strive for foreign aid, but we must maintain the spirit of independence and autonomy. Otherwise, following others blindly, like the Spanish National Defense Committee, which cannot withstand the instigation of a third party and softens its knees, is a good warning. Today, China's international situation is getting better and better day by day, and Britain, France, the United States, and other countries are giving China assistance. We must know that this is entirely the result of China's unyielding war of resistance. But if we rely on foreign aid from this point on, thinking that with foreign aid we can wait for victory without caring about anything, then we are wrong. Foreign aid is earned by China's resolute war of resistance, and the final victory can only be earned by China's own efforts.</p>
<h3>The Head of the Sichuan Construction Department Returns to Chengdu from Chongqing: Negotiates the Development of Sichuan Province's Industry in Chongqing; Results Are Satisfactory, and the Future Holds Promise</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) He Beiheng, the head of the Sichuan Construction Department, went to Chongqing to meet with Minister Weng and financial and industrial circles to discuss issues such as developing Sichuan's export trade and various industrial and commercial undertakings. He returned to Chengdu on the 13th. The results of the discussions were extremely satisfactory. It was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would purchase and transport tung oil for export to alleviate the overstocking and falling prices of tung oil. A Sericulture and Silk Management Committee will be jointly established by the Sichuan Provincial Government to control silk production and sales. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Sichuan Provincial Government, and industrial and commercial circles will invest 300,000 yuan to establish a hemp textile company in Jiangjin. The capital has been fully raised and operations will commence immediately. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is also preparing a plan to purchase the latest British machinery to establish a large-scale textile company to develop the wool textile industry in Sichuan and Xikang. The issue of hide exports is being actively handled by the Trade Commission in consultation with the U.S. government. Furthermore, due to insufficient alcohol production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has jointly invested 200,000 yuan with business circles in counties such as Neijiang and Fushun, sending personnel to Zizhong to purchase land and establish an alcohol factory. The sugar factory formerly operating in Guizhou Province will also be moved to Sichuan to resume production. There are indeed unlimited prospects for Sichuan's industrial and commercial development.

<h3>The Xiangfan Comfort Mission Returns to Xiangyang</h3>
<p>Xiangyang: The Xiangfan comfort mission from all walks of life returned from the front line yesterday. The group consisted of 33 people, including a 15-year-old girl, a 64-year-old dock worker, as well as farmers, shop assistants, women, members of the Korean Volunteer Corps, and the Japanese prisoner Ito. It can be described as an all-encompassing, international comfort mission.

<h3>Guangdong Refugees Return Home from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Recently, there has been a gradual increase in Chinese refugees returning to Guangzhou and various parts of Guangdong from Hong Kong. According to statistics from the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, approximately 1,000 refugees return to Guangdong from Hong Kong each week. Japanese ships run one service per week from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, and two services per week from Hong Kong via Macau to Guangdong. In order to encourage Chinese to return to Guangzhou, the Japanese have specially stipulated free passage, but the Japanese do not guarantee whether Chinese can leave Guangdong after arriving in Guangzhou. Before the outbreak of the war, there were only 300 Japanese in Guangzhou, but now the number has increased to 3,400. According to Macau residents speaking to the Associated Press, many Japanese have recently been searching for houses and shops in Macau, and many Japanese merchants plan to establish branch stores in Macau, resulting in soaring rents. Recently, the "Asahi Shimbun" reported that the Macau authorities and the Japanese side have reached an agreement on Japan's use of Macau. However, this matter has been denied by Portuguese government officials, who pointed out that such an agreement should be concluded by the governments of the two countries. It is reported that Macau's Portuguese representative, Guguhe, recently went to Tokyo to submit documents promoting trade between Macau and Guangzhou to the Portuguese Consulate in Tokyo for transmission to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

<h3>Amoy and Gulangyu Supply Issues Become Problematic</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from Xiamen received here, the Japanese army will issue new currency in Xiamen in early April, and the legal tender currently circulating in Xiamen will be redeemed with the new currency or Japanese yen at a discounted rate of forty cents. In reality, almost all of the residents of Xiamen, except for some Japanese and Koreans, are beggars, so it is unknown what impact any new monetary system will have on them. What is unknown is whether the Japanese's future new currency will be welcomed by the merchants of Gulangyu. Since Xiamen fell into the hands of the Japanese, Gulangyu has specially hired twelve small boats to transport the grain needed in the concession from Zhangzhou, Shima, and other places. The Chinese side also understands this and has specially allowed the navigation of these twelve small boats. However, a few days ago, all twelve of these small boats were detained by the Japanese, who claimed that these boats were owned by Chinese and falsely flying foreign flags. After strong negotiations by the consuls of various countries, they were released, and the supply of Gulangyu was able to avoid interruption. It is now heard that the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen has sent letters to the consuls of various countries stating that all ships sailing between Gulangyu and the Chinese mainland must register with the Japanese Navy before being allowed to sail, and that all goods transported by these ships must be unloaded and stored at the Xiamen wharf. However, the Chinese side is strongly opposed to this measure. It is reported that the Zhangzhou authorities have notified various countries that if the Japanese side takes such action, the Chinese mainland will block the supply of grain to Gulangyu. Currently, the Gulangyu Municipal Council is negotiating with both sides separately, but no results have been achieved. For this reason, the price of food on Gulangyu has been trending upwards. If a proper solution cannot be obtained, the islanders will inevitably become starving corpses. The only hope is that the supply of Xiamen currently relies on the transit supply from Gulangyu. Therefore, the price of food in Xiamen has always been extremely high. If the Japanese side's attitude does not change, those who will be affected first will be the Japanese troops stationed in Xiamen. Up to now, people from Xiamen cross the sea every day to purchase food from Gulangyu, and the consuls of various countries have not restricted this. If Japan maintains a tough stance on the above-mentioned demands, then Gulangyu will respond to the Japanese's extravagant hopes with blockade measures. (13th Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Japanese and Puppets Plot to Disrupt Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since yesterday, Japanese military police and Chinese "police" have been conducting large-scale searches of pawnshops and gold and silver exchange shops throughout the city to prevent them from hoarding Chinese legal tender. This search will continue until the 15th of this month. At the same time, the authorities issued a notice prohibiting people of third countries from purchasing goods from shops with Chinese legal tender. (13th Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) London is currently watching with astonishment the Japanese actions in North China to suppress Chinese legal tender. The general opinion is that the Japanese attempt to force the use of a currency that has been abandoned and is very expensive will inevitably end in failure. However, the impact of the resulting chaos on all enterprises cannot be ignored. It is heard that the British government is currently considering various proposals in a very active manner in order to implement a plan that can make Japan aware of the need to stop its discriminatory actions against British people and interests in China.

<h3>Large Numbers of Refugees Engage in Reclamation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, an official from the National Relief Commission told an Associated Press reporter that approximately one-third of the Chinese people have been directly affected by this war, a confirmed number of 160 million people. In order to assist these refugees, the government has sent them to the interior to engage in reclamation. Up to now, 600,000 people have been sent to the interior, giving them land, farming implements, money, new families, etc., to engage in new productive lives. These 600,000 people have been sent separately to more than 30 "land reclamation areas" in provinces such as northern Fujian, southern Jiangxi, western Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan. All of the "land reclamation areas" adopt the Soviet "collective farm" system. It is understood that the National Relief Commission is currently trying to send more refugees to various "land reclamation areas." In addition to sending refugees to the interior for reclamation, the commission is also recruiting refugees to join the "Engineering and Labor Corps" to engage in the construction of highways and railways in the southwest and northwest of the Chinese interior.

<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the Zhongda (transliteration) yarn factory in Suzhou is currently occupied by the Japanese Textile Company and is not allowing the rightful British owner to enter. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has recently re-addressed this matter with the Japanese side, and as a result, the Japanese government has instructed the Japanese authorities in Shanghai, and it is hoped that this matter will be resolved. A member of parliament then rose to speak, asking Butler if he knew that this was just one example of many incidents of Japanese confiscation of British property. Butler replied that he was well aware of the various difficult situations, but he had detailed the steps taken regarding this matter and hoped that it would be resolved as a result.

<h3>The Soviet Union Unites Military and Civilians: Determined to Protect Territory with All Strength; The Lesson of the Zhanggufeng Incident Is Not Far Off; Minister of Internal Affairs Warns Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session yesterday afternoon. Minister of Internal Affairs Beria immediately delivered a speech, praising the strength of the Soviet army. He said, "The peace policy pursued by Stalin is vastly different from the policies pursued by fascist and bourgeois governments. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its various nationalities, under the leadership of Stalin, have achieved successive victories, which is worthy of pride. The ambitions of the imperialist countries have been exposed by our country, and their plans have been declared a failure. As a result, the ruling classes of capitalist countries all hate the Soviet Union with gnashing teeth. In a word, the provocative actions of the enemies of the Soviet Union have been constrained by the powerful strength of the Soviet Union. Our country's Red Army and Navy, as well as its glorious Air Force and even our country's intelligence agencies, are closely guarding the socialist motherland. The lessons of the Zhanggufeng incident have not only been remembered by foreign generals, but also by the various aggressor nations belonging to the Anti-Comintern Pact. Stalin has instructed us that we must strengthen the power of the country in every way, and we must not neglect this for a moment. The urgent task is to continue to eliminate all hidden enemies and strengthen the national institutions with elements of steadfast will. As for our country's intelligence agencies, they were originally founded by Lenin, and Stalin has further promoted and developed them. The tasks they bear are extremely important. We must now solemnly declare to all enemies that the great Soviet Union cannot be violated by others. Our country's heroic army is not only invincible, but also growing stronger every day. The people and the army of our country have become one and have become a lasting and inseparable force. Any enemy who dares to violate the happiness and freedom of the Soviet people, to attack the sacred borders of the Soviet Union, we will use this force to wipe them out in one fell swoop."

<h3>Manuilsky's Speech Attacks Fascist Countries: British Policy Encourages Aggression; World Labor Needs to Strengthen Its Front</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session today. Manuilsky, Director of the Russian Group of the Communist International, delivered a long speech, which was divided into three sections: the first section reported on the current situation of the Communist Parties of various countries, the second section attacked the fascist countries, and the third section criticized the appeasement policy pursued by Britain and France, especially Britain. His conclusion was that the formation of a united front by the workers of various countries and the strengthening of the people's fronts of various countries are still the two major slogans of the Communist International. The full text of the speech is summarized below:</p>
<h3>Labor's Powerful Weapon</h3>
<p>Manuilsky first called on the workers of various countries, especially the French workers, to work hard to persuade the hesitant peasants and petty bourgeoisie to tell them that the Munich policy pursued by the authorities of various democracies has only made these countries become vassals and that they should join the people's front to resist. "Those who advocate surrendering to the dictatorships are mostly employees of the fascist countries, who often mingle in the labor movement and flaunt pacifism in order to deceive the masses." It should be known that Germany has not yet prepared for war. If the democracies can take a resolute attitude and exert economic pressure, they will surely cause the fascist countries to retreat in the face of difficulty. "If the workers of various countries want to make the democracies change their plans, they should exert material pressure on the bourgeois government authorities. Their weapons are strikes, demonstrations, and mass movements."</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Communist International</h3>
<p>As far as the communist movement in various countries is concerned, it has clearly progressed in recent years. The members of the Communist International are all over the world. In the capitalist countries, their number is no less than 1,200,000, plus 746,000 members of the youth league, totaling about 2,000,000. This is more than double the number five years ago. Among them, the number of members of the French Communist Party has increased from 40,000 to 270,000. The daily sales of the party's newspaper in that country are no less than 470,000 copies. The number of members of the American Communist Party has increased from 20,000 to 90,000. Unfortunately, no significant progress has been made in rural areas. The number of members of the British Communist Party has increased from 6,000 to 18,000. The German Communist Party is under the dictatorship of the National Socialist Party. Although many of its leaders are in prison, it is still able to maintain its original organization and engage in activities among the masses with admirable perseverance. Only the Italian Communist Party has so far failed to form a strong group.</p>
<h3>The Importance of the Mission</h3>
<p>As for the mission of the Communist Party, first, it must demand self-determination rights for the peoples of Austria, Sudetenland, Taiwan, Korea, and Abyssinia; second, it must liberate China and Spain from fascist aggression. At the same time, it is especially necessary to expose the fascist countries' interference in the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of other countries under the pretext of national self-determination. When the fascists pursue their policies, they always use nationalism as a banner, such as Germany's actions towards the Saar region, the Sudeten region, and even the Free City of Danzig. It is a pity that the members of the Communist Parties of certain countries have failed to fully criticize these false and deceptive tactics. For now, the Communist Parties of various countries must, on the one hand, strive for the right of self-determination for the oppressed small and weak nations, and on the other hand, demand improved treatment for the indigenous peoples of the colonies. As for the latter, "those fascist countries that are engaged in inciting war are using the resentment of the colonial peoples to achieve their private aims of plunder." This crisis should be carefully guarded against. For example, the staff of the fascist countries are engaged in various activities in the colonies of Britain and France: first, inciting rebellions in Palestine; second, organizing semi-military "National Volunteer Corps" in India; third, organizing armed fascist stormtroopers in South Africa; and fourth, supplying money and arms to various Arab chiefs. The above-mentioned various methods of inciting the masses should be resisted.</p>
<h3>Distinction Between Aggression and Defense</h3>
<p>In short, a distinction must be made between legitimate and just wars in the world and illegitimate wars of conquest. The former aims at resisting aggression, liberating workers, and liberating the colonial masses, while the latter aims at enslaving other countries and other nations and cannot be treated as one.</p>
<h3>Britain Is Digging Its Own Grave</h3>
<p>At this point, Manuilsky attacked British policy, saying that Britain's attempt to shift Germany's attention and promote its expansion of power to the East in order to harm the Soviet Union is unknown. Britain's reactionary bourgeois policy is similar to the behavior of bandits and is tantamount to digging its own grave. For example, that country secretly supports Japanese aggression, regardless of whether it will push itself beyond the Far East. This is one point. That country's concession to Italian fascism is tantamount to abandoning its position in the Mediterranean. This is the second point. That country's lending funds to the fascist aggressor countries is equivalent to increasing the military strength of the fascist countries and predetermining the failure of its own country. This is the third point. That country's plan to attack the Soviet Union, if it comes to fruition, will not only lead to the collapse of fascism but also to the collapse of the entire capitalism. This is the fourth point.</p>
<h3>The New Regime in Spain Will Be Difficult to Sustain</h3>
<p>As for the policies pursued by Britain and France towards Spain, we cannot agree with them. The recognition of the Nationalist government by these countries as the legitimate government is a transformation from secret interference to open interference. It is unknown that the reactionary countries will never be able to destroy the Spanish nation. "In the past, during the monarchy, King Alfonso XIII and the late dictator General Rivera, although engaged in suppressing the people, failed to last, which is clear proof. Now, there are those who use German cannons to bomb Spanish villages and use Italian bombs to kill Spanish women and children, stained with the blood of the Spanish people and cursed by the Spanish nation (referring to General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army), how can one hope that he will hold power for long?" (12th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Economy: Solid Foundation, Rapid Increase in Industrial and Agricultural Production, Reactionaries Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Antelev, Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Executive Committee, following Manusky, gave a speech praising Stalin's achievements, stating, "The party and the nation have achieved victory amidst hardship, all due to Stalin's leadership. Socialism in the Soviet Union not only has a high chance of success but also has a solid foundation." Since 1929, the volume of Soviet industrial production has increased fivefold, and the first Five-Year Plan was declared complete ahead of schedule. All spies and traitors have been eliminated in turn. "Foreign enemies are therefore greatly disappointed and can no longer wage war against the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union's defense capabilities are growing stronger day by day. Those neighbors who do not know how to advance or retreat and have invaded our borders have already tasted the power of the Red Army and learned a lesson." In terms of the general economy, the number of specialized workers in various industries has increased, with an increase of no less than 1,225,000 technicians and skilled workers. Last year alone, 284,000 technicians graduated from various specialized schools. In rural areas, the number of drivers managing tractors and harvesters has also increased by 1,100,000. In total, 4,700,000 workers nationwide have joined trade unions, and 3,000,000 members of the Communist Youth Service Corps are not included. "Capitalist countries often say that our country's strength has been weakened as a result of the purge, but in fact, the consolidation and stability of our country are far greater than in the past, because our country is led by people who are loyal to Leninism and Stalinism. As far as agriculture is concerned, the enemy wanted to create famine within the Soviet Union and incite farmers to oppose collective farms, but the result was opposed by the people of the whole country, and their conspiracy ultimately failed." Judging from the income of collective farms across the country, it has tripled in five years, and the number of threshing machines and harvesters across the country has increased sevenfold, which shows that the agricultural reform plan has indeed achieved great success, but drought disasters in some areas of the southeast still need to be remedied. "According to Stalin's plan, the grain harvest should be increased to 8,000,000,000 bushels within three or four years, and this plan is not difficult to achieve." To this end, Antelev concluded, "The Soviet nation is now united around Bolshevism, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. Lenin's cause has been inherited by Stalin. Under Stalin's leadership, our Soviet nation can move forward bravely and never fear any resistance." (Havas telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Border Conflict Again Between Japanese and Soviet Border Guards</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Near Qifen, on the eastern border of Manchuria, another conflict occurred between Soviet and Japanese sentries. The two sides fought fiercely for about an hour. According to Japanese news, the total number of participants on both sides was more than 150. Four Japanese soldiers were injured. In the past week, there have been three conflicts between Soviet and Japanese sentries, the largest of which was this one. (Express News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Stalin's Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>"Take Japan as an example. Before Japan invaded North China, major British and French newspapers widely publicized China's weakness and inability to fight, claiming that Japan's military could conquer China in two or three months. As a result, British and American politicians watched and waited for its development. After Japan waged war against China, they allowed it to occupy Shanghai, the center of foreign capital in China, listened to its occupation of Guangzhou, the center of British monopoly power in South China, allowed it to occupy Hainan and surround Hong Kong. Is this any different from encouraging aggression? This is no different from their statement, 'Please work hard to wage war, and we will see what happens in the future.'"</p>
<p>"Take Germany as an example. Although they were responsible for protecting Austria, they allowed it to seize Austria. They abandoned the Sudetenland and allowed Czechoslovakia to fend for itself. Therefore, they abandoned all their responsibilities. At that time, they spread rumors in the newspapers, proclaiming the weakness of the Russian army." "The Russian air force has collapsed." The Soviet Union's rebellion encouraged the German army to move eastward, allowing the country to advance with unearned benefits. "Please wage war against the Bolsheviks immediately, and everything will go smoothly." All this is "no different" from encouraging war and encouraging aggression.</p>
<p>"The propaganda of the British, German, and American press regarding the Soviet Ukrainian is particularly characteristic. These gentlemen desperately clamored that the German army had entered Soviet Ukraine, that the Germans already had the Carpathian Ukraine with a population of 700,000, and that no later than this spring, the Germans would occupy Soviet Ukraine and merge it with the Carpathian Ukraine, increasing the population by 30 million. The purpose of this suspicious clamor seems to be to provoke anti-German sentiment in the Soviet Union, create a poisonous atmosphere, and cause the Soviet Union to clash with Germany for no reason. Of course, Germany may have such madmen who want to merge the elephant—Soviet Ukraine—into the mosquito—Carpathian Ukraine. We have enough straitjackets to deal with this kind of people (long applause). But we can ignore the madmen and talk about ordinary people. Isn't it ridiculous and sad to think that merging Soviet Ukraine into Carpathian Ukraine is serious? "Think about it, the mosquito stands tall and sees the elephant, 'Welcome, brother, I'm very uncomfortable. You have no landlords, capitalists, no oppression, and no fascist leaders. You can live like this. I think you are in this situation and can't help you. The only way to save you is to merge into me (laughter). Now I ask you to lead your small territory and join my scope (laughter and applause).'"</p>
<p>"European and American politicians and the press, not seeing the German army enter Soviet Ukraine, couldn't wait to expose the background of their non-interference policy. They openly wrote on paper that Germany did not move east to the Soviet Union but instead went west to demand colonies, which greatly disappointed them."</p>
<p>"The division of several provinces of Czechoslovakia to Germany may be regarded as the price of attacking the Soviet Union, but Germany does not pay this cash, but instead allows the creditor to take it himself. I don't need to preach or condemn the British interference policy here. It is meaningless to promote morality to those who ignore human morality. Sophisticated bourgeois diplomats have said that politics is politics, but the danger manipulated by advocates of the non-interference policy, and the huge political game, may inevitably destroy themselves." "The above is the true face of the non-interference policy, and the political situation of capitalist countries is also here." "War has created a new situation in international relations, and an atmosphere of fear and unease has grown in international relations. War has destroyed the peaceful order after the war and the basic principles of international treaties, and the value of international treaties and obligations has become a problem. Pacifism and disarmament have become useless. Large and small countries, especially those that advocate a policy of non-interference, are all expanding their armies. The so-called Munich Conference's concessions to aggressor countries have created a blessing for a new era of peace, and no one can believe it. Even those who signed the Munich Treaty, Britain and France, do not believe it and are competing with other countries to expand their armies. The Soviet Union cannot ignore this ominous sign. Any war triggered by an aggressor country, regardless of where in the world it starts, will endanger peaceful countries, and the danger of a new imperialist war is even more serious because it has spread to 500 million people in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Therefore, even if our country firmly maintains a policy of peace, we cannot but do our best to strengthen the fighting strength of the Soviet Red Army and Navy." "The Soviet Union has also adopted other policies to consolidate its international position. In 1934, our country believed that although the League of Nations was weak, it could still be regarded as a tool for exposing aggressors and seeking peace and for restraining war. Therefore, it resolutely joined. The Soviet Union believes that international organizations such as the League of Nations, although weak, should not be underestimated in the current period." "In May 1935, the Soviet Union and France signed a mutual assistance treaty to prevent aggression by aggressor countries. At the same time, it also signed the same treaty with Czechoslovakia. In March 1936, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia signed the same treaty. In August 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression treaty. In such an international situation, the Soviet Union still upholds its original intention of safeguarding peace and promotes its diplomatic policy."</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union's foreign policy is clear and easy to understand. First, we advocate peace and maintain business-like relations with other countries. If other countries also maintain the same relations with us and do not infringe upon our interests, our attitude will remain unchanged. Second, for neighboring countries that share borders with the Soviet Union, we maintain friendly relations with them. If these countries maintain the same relations with us and do not directly infringe upon the Soviet Union's borders or hinder the integrity and security of the borders, our attitude will remain unchanged. Third, we provide assistance to countries that are invaded and struggle for their own independence." "Fourth, we are not afraid of the threats of aggressors and war instigators. If they try to destroy the Soviet Union's borders, if they give us one punch, we will return three punches."</p>
<p>This is the Soviet Union's foreign policy (long and loud applause), which is based on (1) its gradually increasing economic, political, and cultural power, (2) the moral and political unity of Soviet society, (3) the friendship between our country and our people, (4) the Red Army and the Red Navy, (5) a policy of peace, (6) the support of the peace-loving working class around the world, and (7) the common sense of countries that want to maintain peace for a reason. The tasks of the party in terms of foreign policy are (1) to continue the policy of peace and strengthen business-like relations with all countries, (2) to carefully avoid being dragged into war by those who instigate war, because they often want others to take chestnuts out of the fire for them, (3) to strengthen the fighting strength of the Red Army and Navy to the highest limit, and (4) to strengthen our friendship with international workers, because they are conducive to international peace and friendship.</p>
<p>Regarding the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, Stalin described the comprehensive progress in the country, including economic life, cultural development, and the consolidation of political power.</p>
<p>The most significant achievement in economic development lies in the completion of the construction of industry and agriculture using modern technology. There is no longer any outdated technology in our country's factories, and there are no longer any old and rotten tools in the farms, or only a few. Stalin said that in terms of production technology and the degree of application of new technologies in industry and agriculture, the Soviet Union is more advanced than any other country, because in these countries, the application of old machines still hinders production and the application of modern technology.</p>
<p>In terms of social politics, the Soviet Union has completely eliminated the exploiting class, enabling workers, peasants, and intellectuals to join the ranks of the workers and strengthening the moral and political unity of Soviet society.</p>
<p>Consolidating the friendly ties between the Soviet Union's various states, completely democratizing domestic political life, and completing the new constitution are the greatest achievements of this period.</p>
<p>Stalin concluded, "As a result of all this, the domestic situation is completely stable, the government is consolidated, and the world is envious." The development of Soviet industry is not only manifested in the increase in production but also in the development of socialist production and the destruction of private production. The total industrial output has increased from 42,030 million rubles in 1933 (1926-1927 prices) to 100,375 million rubles in 1938, an increase of 138.8%. Socialist industrial production has increased from 42,002 million rubles in 1933 to 100,349 million rubles in 1938, an increase of 138.9%. Private industrial production has decreased from 28 million in 1933 to 26 million in 1938.</p>
<p>Socialist industry accounts for 99.97% of the total industrial production, while private industry accounts for only 0.03%. The reduction of private industry is not accidental but is due to the fact that (1) the socialist economic system is superior to the capitalist system, and (2) the socialist system can provide socialist industry with the latest technological standards in a few years. From the perspective of production technology and the degree of industrial application of modern machines, the Soviet Union is the first in the world. The Soviet Union's industrial development has surpassed the major capitalist countries, with Soviet industrial production increasing ninefold compared to before the war, while major capitalist countries have increased by only 20% or 30%.</p>
<p>Stalin then asked, "Where are we lagging behind? Indeed, the total amount of industrial production per capita in our country is still lagging behind. The economic strength of a country is determined not by the size of its population but only by the total amount of its production, but it is determined by comparing the amount of industrial products consumed by each person in the country with the amount of its industrial production."

<h3>The Conflict Between the Czech and Slovak Peoples: German Authorities Monitor Its Development, Attempt to Establish a Pro-German Regime in Slovakia, Deep Dissatisfaction with the Revival of Benes's Policy</h3>
<p>The Capital of Slovakia: The situation between the Czech Republic and Slovakia suddenly worsened again last night, because according to reports, 18 members of the National Socialist Party who supported the separatist party were shot dead, and the German headquarters was attacked by members of the Czech National Socialist Party. A semi-official statement from Berlin said that the German National Socialist Party intends to use bayonets to establish a pro-German regime in Prague and the capital of Slovakia. Reports from Berlin also said that Hitler and other leaders of the National Socialist Party are currently paying close attention to the development of the Czech crisis. As for here today, all places are still on alert, as if in a state of war. (Associated Press telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Lichenburg: According to news from Prague received by the "News" here, members of the Czech old-fashioned political parties that have been dissolved have been spreading rumors in recent days that there will be a coup in the Czech Republic this week, and that former President Benes will resume national politics. A part of the army and the General Staff are in favor of this coup. (Haitong telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The conflict between the Czech and Slovak peoples is highly valued by semi-official figures here, and they speak up for the Slovak people, stating that the actions of the Czech central government are contrary to the policies advocated by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Award (the arbitration award on the demarcation between Hungary and Hungary). "When former Prime Minister Benes was in office, the government used terrorist means against the Germans. After the Munich Agreement was signed, it again imposed financial and military pressure on the Carpathian Ukraine Province, wanting the Czech people to regain control. The authorities in the province failed to resist resolutely, and the Czech government became more arrogant, and then used violent acts against the Slovak Province, causing the Germans in the Czech Republic to suffer. The methods of the Benes era are reappearing today, which is beyond our country's expectations, and therefore we are anxious about it. The policies advocated by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Award are to build a new Central Europe and end the existing stalemate in the Balkan Peninsula. It is unknown that the current policies of the Czech government authorities are completely contrary to this goal and seem to have lost their sense of common sense and responsibility, but these two are essential for stabilizing the situation in Central Europe." (Havas telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's diplomatic correspondent for the Observer said that although there have been many developments in the Slovak situation in the past 48 hours, the outside world has not yet understood the truth. The appointment of new Slovak cabinet members in Prague is a temporary compromise that can temporarily protect the constitutional government of Slovakia, but the Slovak people have different opinions on the new President Schtör. The young radicals still demand separation from the Czech Republic. Another factor is that although the minority German nation is not strong in number, it is loudly called by the Slovak radicals. According to the leader of the radicals, there is German authority behind the scenes. The most promising feature at present is that no accidents have occurred. According to reliable sources, the Schtör government may have no choice but to first demand the withdrawal of the Czech army and then restore the dismissed leaders to power. At the same time, some people also predict that Slovakia will eventually become another country, protected by Germany, and establish customs and monetary ties with Germany. The German government has not yet taken active steps and has not responded to the appeal for assistance from former Prime Minister Tiso. German officials admit that they cannot understand the truth of the situation, but they feel that there is a dangerous possibility, and semi-official German opinion seems to regard the Schtör government as a paper cabinet. However, some parties believe that Germany has not yet made a decision due to its lack of active action, which is a ripe opportunity to help Slovakia secede from the Czech Republic. (Reuters telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3>The New Premier of Slovakia Declares His Determination to Defend the Interests of the Slovak People, Adopts Various Measures to Maintain Public Order, and the Existing Conflicts Will Soon Be Cleared Up</h3>
<p>Bratislava: The newly appointed Prime Minister of the Slovak government, Schtör, delivered a broad speech last night, declaring that all power in Slovakia should be returned to the civil authorities. As for the existing conflicts between the Hlinka Guard and the various military generals, they will soon be cleared up. Mr. Schtör vehemently denied that he was responsible for the arrest of people due to the reorganization of the cabinet. The Prime Minister continued that some new laws concerning urgent issues would be introduced at the next parliamentary session. In any case, the new government is determined to defend the interests of Slovakia and establish the independent national life of the Slovak people. (Haitong telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Bratislava, Slovakia Province: Prime Minister Schtör recently delivered a radio speech, stating that since the beginning of his tenure, he has taken all necessary measures to ensure public order in the province. All civil officials in the province have resumed their duties as usual, and the Slovak constabulary has also been deployed. The Czech constabulary will withdraw from the province within 24 hours. In addition, 150 people have been arrested this time, including radical leaders, members, and pastors of the Autonomy Party, and they have all been released. (Havas telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>The Capital of Slovakia: According to reliable sources, the Germans in this province have transported a large number of military supplies into the Czech Republic from the German territory across the Danube River, including 1,500 rifles. The provincial authorities learned of this and arrested a large number of people here last night. Three German citizens are also among those arrested. Under the leadership of Gamasin (the former Minister of German Affairs of the Autonomous Government of Slovakia), the Germans have colluded with the separatists of Slovakia to oppose the new government of the autonomous province. In order to prevent trouble, Prime Minister Schtör has ordered the army to occupy all key military points, and the central government has also dispatched troops to enter Slovakia Province. Prime Minister Schtör recently told a reporter from Havas that the German government has heard that it recognizes Durgansky (currently in Vienna City), the former Minister of Transportation of the province, as the only legal representative of the autonomous government, but the reorganization of the provincial government is purely an internal matter and is not something that the German government can interfere with. Therefore, these decisions have nothing to do with us." At the same time, German party leader Gamasin also told a reporter from Havas, "The attitude of the Slovak people after the establishment of the Schtör cabinet should be determined by the people themselves. As for us Germans, we will wait until Prime Minister Schtör announces his policy guidelines and expresses his attitude towards our people before we decide our position." According to Gamasin's announcement yesterday that the Germans recognized the former Tiso cabinet as the only legal government of Slovakia Province, his sudden statement may be in favor of the Schtör cabinet and reserve room for bargaining.

<h3>Hlinka Guard Makes Strong Statement</h3>
<p>Bratislava: The Chief of Staff of the Hlinka Guard issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the new Prime Minister of Slovakia, Schtör, is not worthy of being the leader of the government. Because Mr. Schtör was appointed by Prague, his attitude towards the central government is extremely weak, and the basic goals of the Slovak people have been put aside by him. "Our slogan is to fight with absolutely no compromise against any act that undermines the rights of the Slovak people." (Haitong telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Bratislava: The Hlinka Guard and the German volunteers suddenly occupied the government office here yesterday, hanging the Slovak autonomous flag and the German swastika flag on the roof. The temporary assistant Daeblansky immediately sent a telegram to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central Government, Qi Fagevsky, requesting the disarmament of the German volunteers.

<h3>Conflict Between Germans and Czechs</h3>
<p>Prague: Germans in various Czech towns had multiple clashes with Czechs yesterday due to the celebration of the anniversary of the merger of Austria and Germany. All German residences and shops were ordered to hang the German swastika flag and the Czech national flag. In the morning, an incident occurred at the German Hoffman Hotel where Czechs attempted to tear down the swastika flag, resulting in the destruction of the store. In the afternoon, there were multiple incidents of fighting between Germans and Czechs. (Haitong telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Brno: Yesterday was the German Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers. The Germans here held a meeting to commemorate the day, which resulted in a conflict with the Czechs. As a result, dozens of Germans were injured. Brno is the city with the largest number of Germans in Czechoslovakia. Yesterday, to commemorate the fallen soldiers, the Germans hung the Czech national flag and the German swastika flag in front of their residences in accordance with the recent minority agreement signed by Germany. However, the Czechs did not abide by the agreement, tore down the German flag, and insulted the homeowners, which caused a serious conflict. The leader of the Germans in the area, Schwab, was severely beaten by Czechs in the street. Czech detectives stood by and watched. Later, a detachment of the German Wehrmacht came to the rescue, but Schwab had already been seriously injured. (Haitong telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Expands Anti-Czech Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Reports of the mistreatment of German expatriates within Czech territory continue to pour into Berlin, recalling similar situations from September of last year. Newspapers are filled with news of injured German expatriates and shattered windows of German shops. The German News Agency also reports that Czech soldiers in Přískrěice attacked members of the Henlein Guard with bayonets, injuring eleven people. Furthermore, a Sudeten German newspaper published in Germany claims that German students in Prague were beaten, Czechs smashed the windows of German-owned hotels, and repeatedly attempted to tear down swastikas. A certain German worker was knocked to the ground and beaten. The Czechs allegedly chanted slogans such as "Down with the Swastika Flag" to welcome former President Beneš back to the country, and sang anti-German songs like "Thunder and Lightning on the Germans." When this song was sung, one German did not remove his hat and was knocked down. It is rumored in Prague that a campaign to welcome Beneš back will take place this week. The newspaper also carries a message from Bratislava, claiming that the Chief of Staff of the Henlein Guard has issued a declaration stating that the new Slovak Prime Minister Sidor is not qualified to call himself the commander-in-chief of the Guard. According to a dispatch from Budapest, Slovakia may become an independent state under German protection. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Tiso Invited to Berlin</h3>

<h3>German-Czech Border Bridge Sealed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the Danube River bridge near Engels (border between Germany and the Slovak province) has been closed by the Czech authorities.

<h3>British Newspaper Observes Developments in the Czech Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Dispatches from various capitals of Central European countries offer varying observations on the potential developments in the Czech situation. The Daily Telegraph's Prague dispatch states that there is reason to believe that the tension between Berlin and Prague at the end of last week has eased. The Times' Berlin dispatch, however, states that one thing is certain: the German government considers the now-removed Tiso government to be the legitimate government of Slovakia. Berlin's most authoritative critics believe that, from Germany's point of view, the actions of the Czech government and the Ruthenian Ukraine have reopened the question of the structure of the Czech state. The implication is that Germany could force the Czech state to be divided into three independent states and form a federation that could closely cooperate with Germany in diplomatic and economic policies. In this way, the demands of ethnic minorities can be satisfied without the need for the division of the Czech state, and the disputes that Poland's demand for Ruthenia to be ceded to Hungary would cause could also be resolved. The Daily Mail's Prague dispatch states that Prague officials now fear that German troops could occupy Brno at any time to support the demand for Slovakia to be an independent state under German protection. If Prague does not yield, German troops may cross the narrow isthmus that now bisects the Czech state and drive straight in. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Madrid Order Restored Report of Communist Remnants Rising Again in Cartagena</h3>
<p>Madrid Troops belonging to the National Defense Committee occupied "Independence Square" this afternoon. The Communist rebellion of the last six days has been almost completely quelled. Previously, the artillery unit belonging to the National Defense Committee had shelled the Communist-occupied strongholds. Knowing that resistance was futile, they surrendered one after another. Five hundred government personnel detained by the party in the Prado Museum were then freed. The Romanian Embassy happened to be in the war zone, and a large number of people sympathetic to the National Army were hiding inside. Because the Communist Party respected the embassy buildings, they did not intercept anyone until now. Order in the city has now returned to normal, and shops are scheduled to reopen tomorrow.

<p>(London) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Shakespeare, is scheduled to submit the 1939-40 naval budget to the House of Commons on the 15th of this month. According to a Havas reporter's inquiry, once the entire 1939 and 1940 shipbuilding program is completed, the British Navy will possess the world's unprecedentedly powerful battleship fleet, including as many as 25 battleships. According to the five-year military expansion plan, in addition to the existing 15 battleships, two new battleship squadrons are planned to be formed. One of these squadrons includes five 35,000-ton battleships, equipped with 14-inch guns. Construction has already begun, and the first ship can be completed by the end of next year, entering the fleet and beginning service. The other squadron includes five 40,000-ton battleships, equipped with 16-inch guns. Two of these ships were ordered in 1938, and the other two were ordered in 1939. The keel can be laid in a short period of time, and the fifth ship will be ordered within next year. In total, these two squadrons of battleships cost 90,000,000 pounds. In addition, the British government plans to renovate several battleships that have reached their service age to extend their service life. British naval officials claim that such a strong battleship fleet is unprecedented in the history of the navies of all countries in the world. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army Defends Baoying Chiang Kai-shek Orders Yu Xuezhong to Recover Huaiyin Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Various Places Daily</h3>
<p>Special report from this newspaper: Since the Japanese army recently launched separate attacks on Huaiyin, Haizhou, and other places in northern Jiangsu, the Chinese army has put up a fierce resistance. The Japanese army has been restrained by the guerrilla forces of the Chinese army both north and south of the Yangtze River, and has not yet made any significant progress. Currently, the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu is launching a counterattack in several directions, and has already captured Baoying and is counterattacking Huaiyin. The momentum is very strong. Now, the Japanese army has sent its planes to indiscriminately bomb the area, and many innocent civilians have suffered. The military situation in various parts of northern Jiangsu in recent days is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Battles in Various Directions: A dispatch from Taixian reports that the Japanese army is pouring all of its sea, land, and air power into a four-pronged offensive against northern Jiangsu. The Shandong troops are invading from Huantengdun, a town in Yizhou, southern Shandong. The Nakajima unit is advancing east along the Longhai Railway, passing through Ahu, and, along with the Hirano unit, is attacking Dapu, Xinpu, Shuikou, Dashanzhen, Liudukou, and even Haizhou. The main forces of Province Chairman Han Deqin's unit, the Revenue Police Corps, and the Miao and Yu units are engaged in fierce battles in various locations. The Japanese navy is also landing at Lianyungang and attacking Xugouzhen, seven kilometers west of the city. Tao Huipu has come forward to organize a puppet maintenance association, with Tao as the pseudo-chairman. At the same time, the Tateishi unit is engaged in fierce battles with the main force of the Chinese army in Pingqiao, Baimahu, Luojiadun, and even Baoying, all located 20 kilometers south of Huaiyin. A naval landing party of the Japanese army is invading Funing along the Sheyang River, and is facing strong resistance from the Chinese army everywhere in Dongtianzhen, 24 kilometers north of the county seat. The Hori and Saeki units are secretly attacking Suqian County from Luowu, six kilometers south of Suqian, and are engaged in fierce street fighting with the Chinese Shen unit for an hour. Japanese mountain guns broke through the city walls in many places. The Sawada unit is engaged in fierce battles in the Glass Factory, Caojiaji, Hanjiaji, and even Shuyang, two kilometers north of Suqian, and Qianjiaji and Zhang Dajia, eight kilometers southeast of Shuyang. The Furuta unit is advancing from Lujiaji, Dayuji, Zhangjialou, and Yujiazhuang in Suqian towards the Soshinsuiko, in order to meet up with the Ikuta unit attacking Lianshui. At the same time, in Yanghezhen and Cangji in Suqian, and even Siyang, they are engaged in fierce battles with the 57th and 69th Brigades of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Firmly Defending Shi Ying: A dispatch from Taixing reports that the Japanese are attempting to occupy the entire northern Jiangsu region. From the 1st of this month, they sent land and air forces to attack east from Hongze Lake, successively invading Siyang and Huaiyin, and even once reaching Baoying. However, after the valiant counterattack by the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and their morale was greatly diminished. At the same time, a certain unit of the Chinese army stationed in Anhui quickly arrived in the Suisu area of northern Jiangsu, cutting off their retreat route. The Japanese army was terrified and actively retreated. A certain unit of the Chinese army has already recovered the county seat of Baoying. The Japanese army has retreated to Pingqiao, south of Huaiyin. Looking at the situation of the Japanese side, apart from the air force bombings, the strength of the land forces is extremely weak and it is difficult to plot any further development in northern Jiangsu. Currently, the various routes of the Chinese army are continuing to intensify their counterattacks, vowing to completely annihilate the invading Japanese army in northern Jiangsu. However, Siyang, Huai'an, Baoying, Funing and other counties have suffered heavy damage from the Japanese planes, and many civilians have been killed or injured. (8th)</p>
<p>Counterattacking Huaiyin: A dispatch from Taixian reports that after the Japanese army invaded and occupied Huaiyin, the Chinese army, under the leadership of Han Deqin, the acting chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has completed a strong defensive position in the Gaoshiyanfu area to prevent the Japanese army from advancing south. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has ordered Yu Xuezhong, commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone, to recover Huaiyin within seven days. The Yu unit has already cut off the retreat route of the Japanese army and is preventing their advance. At the same time, various units of the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu are counterattacking. According to reliable information, the troops of the Yu Xuezhong's headquarters stationed in Anhui have arrived in northern Jiangsu overnight and have now approached Suisu, cutting off the retreat route of the Japanese army. The Japanese army in northern Jiangsu is in a panic and dare not move forward any further. (8th)</p>
<p>Japanese Warships: A dispatch from Taixian reports that at 8:00 a.m. on the 3rd, Japanese motorized boats suddenly appeared on the river surface of Qipinggang, Taixian County. Many Japanese soldiers attempted to land at the harbor. The local defense forces discovered this and immediately opened fire. The Japanese army, seeing that there was preparation, immediately turned and went away from the harbor, heading towards the perilous area of the river. Also, at 11:00 a.m. on the 6th, Japanese warships and 15 small motorized boats sailed back and forth on the Jiangkou river surface. They left separately at the 7th and dared not move rashly. The Japanese continued to search for civilian ships in the river, and it could be seen that their intention was only to disrupt Japanese navigation in the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Planes: A dispatch from Yuhe reports that the Japanese army is attempting to invade Huaiyin in order to disrupt the rear area. The previous day, a Japanese plane dropped several bombs over Baoying, landing in the suburbs and missing its target. Yesterday (2nd), six more Japanese heavy bombers came and dropped 47 bombs, all of which landed in the northern suburbs of the city, damaging a small number of empty houses. The people were prepared and had evacuated to other places, so there were no losses. At 12:00 a.m. on March 40, the air defense agency suddenly issued an alarm, and two enemy planes were seen coming from the northeast, circling over this area for 20 minutes before heading southeast.</p>
<p>Cable Repair: A dispatch from Yuhe reports that the Japanese army invaded Huaiyin with the intention of disrupting the rear area, cutting off telephone communication, and stopping military news. On the 2nd, the telephone poles between Huaiyin and Baoying (Jieshou to Fanshui) were destroyed. After learning of this, a certain regiment of our army sent workers to repair them, and communication has now been restored. Also, about 200 Japanese soldiers, carrying two steel cannons and many light and heavy machine guns, attacked the defense area of a certain regiment of the General Corps of the Chinese Army Security Forces east of the Lujia ferry in two routes. A fierce battle immediately broke out. Reinforcement troops of the Chinese army arrived one after another, and the Japanese army could not resist and collapsed back into the city. In this battle, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed. About 300 Japanese troops (more than half of whom were puppet troops) were stationed in Liujiazhuang, Shaobo. At about 11:00 a.m. on the 6th, 40 to 50 Japanese and puppet troops patrolled near Qiaoshi and came into contact with the Chinese army, which lasted for about two hours. The Japanese army could not withstand and was driven back by the Chinese army. (7th)</p>
<h3>Qiantang River Seawater Inversion: Central Government Allocates Funds for Repairs</h3>
<p>Lishui Dispatch: The Qiantang River project in Zhejiang Province, originally managed by the Hangzhou-Pinghu and Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Engineering Offices, has been affected since the fall of western Zhejiang, which became a guerrilla zone. After the Water Conservancy Bureau was merged into the Agricultural Improvement Institute, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan seawall project was assigned to the local government. Due to the project's importance and lack of technical personnel, the local government was unable to cope. Therefore, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section Engineering Office was re-established in July of last year, under the jurisdiction of the Third District Commissioner's Office. In January of this year, it was placed directly under the Construction Department. Repairing the dangerous seawalls is difficult due to funding shortages, and the plan cannot be advanced. Moreover, in the Haining area of the Hangzhou-Pinghu section, over a thousand *mu* have been inundated, and repairs have not been carried out. There are hundreds of meters of breaches, causing seawater inversion, which damages farmland and results in huge losses. Engineers were dispatched at great risk to cross the river and investigate. Among them, the "Shuo," "Gan," "Wu," and "Ding" sections have the most severe breaches. It is currently planned to build temporary earthen seawalls. Furthermore, the "Wu," "Duo," and "Shi" stone seawalls are also in imminent danger. If they are breached by the tide, the consequences would be very serious. In addition, the "Mi" sloped seawall is also damaged and it is planned to build an earthen backup wall. Other places such as Huayue Temple and Chen Tiangang are riddled with holes and need to be repaired and reinforced, the damage is incalculable. As for the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Jianghai seawall, the Xijiang seawall is fraught with danger and should also be reinforced. The embankment body and water carrying areas of Tantou in Linpu, the embankment body and water carrying areas from Dongjiabu to Zhenhai Temple, the He Pan water carrying dam, the Kaihongji dike, and the earthworks attached to the coastal seawall should all be dealt with in order. Recently, the central government and the provincial government have jointly allocated a total of 400,000 yuan for seawall public works. The Construction Department has drafted a repair project plan and submitted it to the provincial government for deliberation and decision. A temporary engineering office for the Jianghai seawall in Zhejiang Province will be established, and the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section Engineering Office will be placed under its jurisdiction. In addition, a Hangzhou-Pinghu seawall Engineering Office will be established in Haining, and personnel and engineers will be dispatched to cross the river to work. However, because this area is a guerrilla zone, there is always the possibility of being attacked by the Japanese army. Therefore, the salaries of the engineering staff will be discussed and decided.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Area Becomes Increasingly Prosperous, Financial Center Shifts to Yunnan Province: Various Banks Prepare to Establish Branches, Industrial Circles Actively Engage in Development</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: The situation in South China has shifted, and transportation between Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Wuhan is blocked. The sea route for China has shifted to the Yunnan-Burma-Guangxi-Vietnam line. All goods enter and exit through this route, and the center of our finance and economy has also shifted to this area. In the past three or four months, all measures have been gradually completed. At the same time, the central authorities, in order to concentrate manpower and financial resources to actively develop the rich resources of the southwest and lay a new foundation for the rear, are encouraging compatriots at home and abroad to assist the government in investing in the southwestern border provinces, developing resources, and using them as a backing for national reconstruction. Therefore, the strongholds along the main transportation lines in Yunnan, Burma, Guangxi, and Vietnam are now consolidating finance and cargo transportation to adapt to the needs of the times, intensifying their development, and promoting them in an orderly manner. Imperceptibly, they have become a major driving force for national reconstruction, shouldering the important new mission of the future rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Major Banks Expand Their Businesses: Under the current situation, major figures in the domestic and foreign banking industries, in order to seize the opportunity to develop their businesses, connect domestic and foreign industries, and promote the prosperity of the southwest industry, are accelerating the organization of branches in Kunming, Yangon, and Haiphong. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Guangdong Provincial Bank, and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank are all actively planning to open branches in the above-mentioned areas. Some have already announced their establishment, while others are still in the planning stage. The manager of the Kunming branch of the Bank of Communications, Mr. Lu, and the manager of the Kunming branch of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Mr. Shunxian, who had recently traveled to Hong Kong, have already left Hong Kong and are taking the Haiphong-Saigon route to Yangon and then to Kunming. They will inspect the local commercial situation along the way and prepare to plan the establishment of more branches in Vietnam and Burma. According to news from the banking circles in Hong Kong, overseas Chinese banks in Singapore are also sending representatives back to Kunming to inspect and plan the organization of branches. Looking at the current domestic and foreign financiers, all are shifting their attention to Yunnan, Burma, and Vietnam, considering how to develop the financial economy in these areas so that the financial and economic axis can be fully established in the strongholds along this transportation line in a short period of time, enhancing the economic construction of the southwest. Industrial Magnates Flock to Yunnan and Burma: It has also been found that industrialists and manufacturers from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Wuhan are now focused on the Yunnan-Burma-Guangxi-Vietnam transportation lines, which are becoming increasingly smooth and connected, with cargo transportation concentrated there. The financial and economic center is also gradually shifting. Those who were previously active in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan are now moving to Kunming, Yangon, and Haiphong-Saigon. Therefore, in order to develop their own businesses and promote the industrial resources of the southwest, they must seize the opportunity to establish branches or factories in Kunming, Yangon, and other places, and engage in development. In addition to dispatching special personnel to Kunming and Yangon to conduct on-the-ground investigations and prepare to start planning, they are now personally traveling to conduct close inspections and considerations, hoping to complete all the implementation plans as soon as possible. The progress of this matter is of particular concern to manufacturers. Major shareholders of cotton art manufacturing factories and weaving factories in Hong Kong and Guangdong, the Shanghai New New Weaving Factory, and the Kang Yuan Canned Food Factory have already gone to Yunnan. Businessmen from Hong Kong and Guangdong have also gone to investigate the mineral resources in various parts of Yunnan, preparing to quickly raise huge amounts of capital for mining and assist in the development of light and heavy industries.</p>

<h3>Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps: Declaration of the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps of the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps issued a declaration yesterday stating that the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps is the new and only revolutionary organization and has been recognized unanimously throughout the country. This is the inevitable result of China's historical development and the requirements of the current stage of the Chinese revolution: First, to concentrate revolutionary forces to strive for the final victory in the war of resistance; second, to mobilize revolutionary forces to build a new foundation for a new China based on the Three Principles of the People; third, to cultivate new, continuous revolutionary forces. The Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps was created to meet these needs, and the importance of this great mission cannot be overstated. The Central Corps Headquarters of the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps, wishing to carry out new revolutionary work in the Jiangnan area, has established the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps to accelerate the organization of lower-level groups in order to lay a new revolutionary foundation. After three months of active preparation, the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps has established lower-level groups from Nanjing and Shanghai to the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Especially in Shanghai, in an extremely harsh environment and surrounded by dark forces, the extension of revolutionary forces has achieved a successful and vigorous appearance, and has imperceptibly become the main force in the war of resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>However, the Jiangnan area, under the oppression of the enemy, has formed an entire dark world. All reactionary forces are taking the opportunity to extend themselves. Not only are feudal remnants using the name of revolutionary forces to swindle and extort, but Japanese imperialism is also cleverly using the name of revolutionary forces to pass off fish eyes for pearls and undermine the Chinese revolution. This is something we deeply resent. Now, in addition to actively intensifying our work to suppress all reactionary attempts, we hope that authorities from all walks of life will be vigilant and severely crack down on them. Under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, we must unite and work together to develop revolutionary forces. Although the Jiangnan Corps has only had a short three-month preparation period, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, giving us many conveniences in our work. This is something we are very excited and grateful for. We will work harder with a spirit of tenacious revolution in order to quickly expand the corps and spread the new life of the revolution throughout the entire Jiangnan area.</p>
<h3>Chen Lijiang Discusses Chinese Education in the Past Year (4)</h3>
<p>Finally, we must not forget the many moving stories of our educational comrades in the occupied areas. For example, in Beiping, although some dregs of the education community have served as tools of Japanese imperialism, the majority of educational comrades who are loyal, patriotic, and sworn not to set foot in the dark world still prevails. As far as is known, in the Beiping area, Feng Zixun, Wang Xihui, Qian Xuantong, Dai Junren, and others are sworn not to submit to the enemy. For example, when the puppet organization in Beiping forced students to participate in a parade celebrating the fall of Xuzhou, some students from a normal school, motivated by patriotic fervor, angrily tore up the slogan banners they held in their hands. It can be seen that the Japanese invaders' enslavement education has not only failed but has only made the youth in the occupied areas more loyal and heroic under intense oppression and stimulation. For example, in Shanghai, there is the tragic fact that Feng Guohua, the former director of the Shishan County Education Bureau, mobilized the people in Qingpu to organize a guerrilla team and fought bravely against the enemy and puppets, sacrificing his life for his country. These are all things that everyone already knows. There are countless other loyal and courageous comrades and their heroic battles that are unknown to everyone. This kind of steadfast integrity and heroic battle is not only the glory of our education community but also the most definite guarantee that the Japanese invaders will inevitably be defeated and our nation will inevitably rise. In summary, from the perspective of our creation, Chinese education in this year has not only gained a unanimous and accurate understanding in terms of theory but is also facing the mission of the times and making multifaceted efforts towards new and progressive advancement, and marching forward towards the bright future of national liberation. This year, Chinese education has seen both the enemy's destruction and our creation. We have briefly overviewed both. We are saddened by what we have seen of the enemy's destruction, and we are excited by what we have seen of our creation. Because we have seen the enemy's destruction and also seen our creation, we will never be discouraged by the enemy's ferocity. On the contrary, the enemy's ferocity has only helped us to develop deeper grief and anger and a more determined and courageous ambition to strive and work tirelessly. Because we have seen our creation and also seen the enemy's destruction, we will never be complacent with a little bit of innovation and progress. On the contrary, we will use this year's efforts as a foundation, and on this foundation, let us work harder with down-to-earth work, a fact-seeking attitude, and a constantly progressing spirit, and move forward to a greater and brighter path. The year 1938 of the Republic of China has passed. Let us all make a vow that we will not be afraid of violence, we will never be complacent, and we are prepared to exhaust our heart and strength under the enemy's more frantic and cruel destruction, to play the role of education, to open up the nation's wisdom, to thoroughly defeat the enemy, to eliminate this executioner of Eastern civilization, and to recreate our bright and splendid Chinese civilization and build our great and progressive culture in such efforts and struggles.

<h3>Securities: Rumors of Changes in Banknote Redemption Methods, Domestic Debt Will Not Be Small for the Time Being, There is Talk of 40% Gold and 60% Unified Bonds</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market fell yesterday due to profit-taking by the bulls, but after a period of ups and downs, prices were still firm, seemingly driven by the majority's sentiment. Although the 20th and other parties slightly reduced their holdings, it is feared that it has not changed their original bullish policy. According to news from the financial sector, the previous method of redeeming banknotes with silver has been slightly changed to 40% unified public bonds and 60% gold, fully redeeming the banknotes. The public bonds are valued at the legal price before August 13, and gold is valued at 1,950 yuan per tael (ten taels). With this method, redeemers can earn 500 to 600 yuan per 10,000 yuan. The government can recover gold, and the public bonds can increase in value. However, few people know about this new method, so the market price is still fluctuating. Once people realize this, the market price should turn upwards. There are also rumors in the market that a peaceful atmosphere is brewing again, and the market price will usher in a second wave of increases. After the market opened yesterday morning, the 20th slightly sold off, leading many to believe that the bulls were taking profits. The 15th, Dafeng and Tongkang, also sold off, either liquidating their positions or buying in. The price stabilized. The 14th, Lianhe and Maoda, both absorbed the selling. The market price fell by five to eight and a half jiao. In the afternoon, the 5th, 11th, and Tongkang continued to sell, but Yongkang, Lianhe, Hengfu, and retail investors all bought in, and the trend turned from weak to firm. The market price rebounded by one to three jiao. After two days of weakness, the bulls still seem to have the upper hand, because the bulls have a longer-term view, while the bears have a very short-term view. Because the environment is favorable for the bulls, the bears still feel that there is no opportunity to take advantage of, and they may change their tactics. As a result, the market price generally continued to rise by four and a half to seven jiao. The total turnover was estimated to be around one million yuan. A simple table is listed below, with the government-stipulated prices before August 13 listed for reference.</p>
<p>Bond Type, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A, 57.35, 56.90, 57.20, Down 0.55</p>
<p>Unified B, 51.10, 50.45, 50.75, Down 0.65</p>
<p>Unified C, 51.10, 50.15, 50.50, Down 0.45</p>
<p>Unified D, 49.80, 49.00, 49.35, Down 0.50</p>
<p>Unified E, 50.00, 49.10, 49.45, Down 0.70</p>
<p>96, 6.75, —, 6.75, Down 0.10</p>
<p>Prices Stipulated by the Government Before August 13</p>
<p>A 76.00, B 73.50, C 71.50, D 70.00, E 70.00. From this, it can be seen that the current market price is still far from the government price.</p>
<p>The stock market traded 50 shares of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange at a price of 27.30 yuan, up another 7 jiao from the previous day.</p>
<p>A note to Ms. Zhao Chuqing: Mr. Cai Xingjiu has already replied to your inquiry. Market fluctuations are a temporary phenomenon. The fundamental plan is to strive for victory in the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Prices are More Likely to Rise Than Fall, Up Another 18 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial cash gold market fluctuated constantly, and the situation remained volatile. Initially, the price rose to 2,100 yuan in the morning due to the tightening of foreign exchange rates and the fact that the securities firms were buying more than they were selling. Later, some foreign bank bulls took profits and rushed to sell, and local Chinese firms also followed suit, causing the market price to fall to a low of 2,080 yuan at one point. Finally, as foreign exchange rates continued to tighten, the securities firms came to buy again, and a certain money exchange firm also bought aggressively, so the price quickly rebounded, eventually rising by 18 yuan. People were slightly dazed, and trading was still active, around 800 taels. Jewelry gold prices also fluctuated, but ended up rising by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British bullion remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Fluctuates Constantly</p>
<p>Since the morning, the price for each tael (ten taels) initially opened at 2,090 yuan due to the gradual tightening of foreign exchange rates, so sellers were mostly hesitant to sell, causing the price to rise to 2,100 yuan before trading began. First, the securities firms sold 60 taels to the jewelry firms, with the opening price at 2,100 yuan, 20 yuan higher than on Saturday. Soon after, the securities firms bought back 50 taels from the jewelry firms and gold firms at the same price. After that, a certain bank suddenly dumped its profits on behalf of a foreign bank, causing the price to fall, selling 50 taels to money exchange firms and cash firms at a price of 98 yuan, and another 50 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 97 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm also sold on behalf of local Chinese firms, selling 50 taels to its peers at a price of 94 yuan. After that, the tight trend of foreign exchange became more severe, so there were fewer buyers, and the price fell, selling 50 taels to the securities firms for 80 yuan. At that time, the securities firms took the opportunity to buy again at a low price, with the securities firms buying 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm for 85 yuan, and the gold firms buying 50 taels from the silver firms for 89 yuan. In a short while, the jewelry firms also bought 50 taels from the money exchange firms for 90 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, the money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves, with the closing price at noon being 90 yuan. Trading was quiet in the afternoon, but as foreign exchange continued to weaken due to the manipulation of foreign firms, it also rose accordingly. First, the money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves for 90 yuan, and then the jewelry firms sold 50 taels to the money exchange firms for 94 yuan. More than half an hour later, a certain money exchange firm bought 50 taels from its peers for 97 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from the cash firm for 98 yuan. It was already past 4 o'clock at this time. After that, they still wanted to buy at the same price, but it was difficult to find sellers, so no trading took place. Therefore, the closing price was still 2,098 yuan, resulting in a gain of 18 yuan compared to last Saturday. The difference for the day was 20 yuan. The cash firm's price for selling its own-brand gold was 2,110 yuan, and the price for buying it back was 2,095 yuan. The current price for bullion is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and no trading has taken place.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Fluctuate</p>
<p>The initial price for selling jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores did not change. But at 9:55, because the cash gold market opened with a strong upward trend, they also raised the price by 1 yuan. Later, at 10:30, because cash gold suddenly weakened, they also reduced the price by 2 yuan. At 11:55, because cash gold rebounded, they also raised the price by 1 yuan. At 4:15 in the afternoon, because cash gold continued to rise, they also raised the price by another 1 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 1 yuan. Datongxing, Lao Qingyun, and other stores changed their prices to 213 yuan, while newer stores set their price at 211 yuan, and the price for buying it back was 205 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash was initially 1,210 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold price also remained unchanged, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, still calculated at 1,205 yuan and 6 jiao. This was due to the London cable on the 11th stating that British pure gold had not changed, remaining at £7, 8 shillings, and 3 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Flour and Wheat Settlements, Silk Mills and Tianjin Firms Also Settling, Causing the Tightening of British and American Exchange Rates to Intensify</h3>
<p>Although "North China United Bank" suddenly sold heavily in the foreign exchange market yesterday, foreign banks had a strong appetite, so the situation was relatively stable. Afterwards, the situation gradually tightened due to the numerous flour and wheat settlements, the fierce buying by Tianjin speculators and silk merchants, and the frequent buying of forward American exchange by the oil company Mobil. The foreign banks were also less willing to supply, and trading was quite active. Because foreign firms were also actively buying Hong Kong exchange, the situation also became loose.</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, London's large bills and near term shrank by 0.0625, while far term remained unchanged. New York silver prices also did not rise or fall. London gold also remained unchanged. The exchange rate between the British pound and the American dollar remained the same, with a small increase of 3 points for the French franc, and unchanged for Shanghai exchange. The American dollar remained unchanged against the British pound, with a small increase of 0.0625 against the French franc, and unchanged against Shanghai exchange. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling price of the bank in the morning was 8 pence and 3.4375 for British exchange, and 16.3125 yuan for American exchange. Compared with last Saturday, both British and American exchange rates did not change. After opening, although "North China United Bank" suddenly sold heavily, foreign banks such as HSBC had a strong appetite, so there was little change. A favorable rate of 8 pence and 375 for British exchange was sold to HSBC, and American exchange at 16.375 yuan was also sold to foreign banks. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was 5 li, calculated at 8.00%. After that, the oil company Mobil suddenly started buying, aggressively buying forward American exchange, settling the March American exchange at 16.25 yuan with a certain bank, and then buying the May American exchange at 16.0625 yuan with a certain bank. Later, Shanghai yarn factories also followed suit, and Tianjin speculators also competed to buy, so the underlying trend tightened. Silk factories and Tianjin speculators successively bought English exchange from a certain bank in Macao at 8 pence and 3125 and American exchange at 16.25. Near noon, foreign banks sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 56 yuan, which was also soft. At the close of the noon session, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 28125 for British exchange and 16.1875 yuan for American exchange.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the underlying trend continued to tighten due to the numerous flour and wheat settlements and the continued reluctance of foreign banks to sell. First, foreign firms settled English exchange with HSBC Macao at 8 pence and 28125, and then settled American exchange with a certain bank at 16.15625 yuan. Finally, foreign firms also aggressively bought Hong Kong exchange, and foreign banks became less willing to supply, so the situation became even softer. Foreign firms bought and settled Guangdong Hong Kong exchange from Huaxing Bank at 55 yuan and a half. At the close of the evening session, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 265625 for British exchange and 16.15625 yuan for American exchange. As a result, compared with the end of last week, British exchange tightened by 0.078125, American exchange tightened by 0.15625, and Hong Kong exchange also became more expensive by 0.0625.</p>
<p>The exchange rates of Hong Kong and Tianjin against British and American exchange and the exchange rate against Shanghai will be listed in the market price section from today, and readers should pay attention.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Reemerges, 50 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly rose sharply, rising to the 50 yuan barrier per thousand yuan. It was as high as 49 yuan in the early morning, and then rose to 50 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it once reached 50 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally 50 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, foreign exchange firms in the local market were settling accounts very actively, and banks were not supplying smoothly, so the market price gradually became tight and the trend was very weak. Cash gold opened stably, but then the exchange rate tightened, and gold firms and money exchange firms bravely bought in. People were strong, and retail supply was scarce with limited chips. Wealthy foreigners resumed buying British, American, and gold pounds, which rose sharply by 3 to 5 jiao. Other American dollar bills and Hong Kong dollar bills were in slightly higher demand. Public Association transactions were not prosperous. Qintai sold and Yongtai bought American dollar bills for 500 yuan, and then sold and Xiangkang bought Hong Kong dollar bills for 200 yuan. Chengtai sold and Xiangkang bought Hong Kong dollar bills for 200 yuan. Qintai sold and Yongfeng bought American dollar bills for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds rose by 3 jiao, British gold bills rose by 2 jiao and 1 fen, American gold pounds rose by 5 jiao, American gold bills rose by 4 fen and 2 li, Hong Kong dollar bills rose by 1 fen and 2 li, French franc bills rose by 1 li and 2 hao and a half, Singapore dollar bills, Annam dollar bills, and Philippine dollar bills each rose by 2 fen, Dutch dollar bills rose by 3 fen, Robi dollar bills and Canadian dollar bills each rose by 1 fen, and Australian gold bills rose by 4 jiao. Only Italian dollar bills, German gold bills, and Siamese dollar bills did not change.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Large Holders Continuously Liquidating, Cotton Yarn Difficult to Revive</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains depressed and continues to decline. The real sales are bleak and unremarkable, causing people's confidence to weaken. Yunnan firms have a relatively large demand, and Hong Kong firms are also slightly increasing their purchases, so the situation can still support one step. Therefore, after the decline, it rebounded slightly. However, a certain large company has a normal mindset and vomits out a large amount from time to time. Recently, it is said that the amount of liquidation is about 7,000 to 8,000 bales. Therefore, the market is slightly loose. The lowest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 391 yuan. Then, scalpers suddenly came to buy, and some people said that based on past experience, if it falls to the 390 yuan barrier, it will rebound. This kind of trading has happened several times. At noon, the Hong Kong firms bought another 240 bales of Double Horse yarn at a price of 391 yuan and a half to 2 yuan. People's confidence was shaken, and the bulls pulled up the price again by 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation: At the opening of the market in the morning, the traders gathered to talk, but the actual transactions were still sluggish and the market was tired. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods fell by 2 yuan to 393 yuan. Then, as a certain company came to sell again, people's confidence loosened further, and the lowest price was 391 yuan. The warehouse order price was 388 yuan. By the time of closing, there were slightly cheaper goods, and it rebounded by 1 yuan. The price of Double Horse was 392 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, people's confidence turned from weak to strong due to the renewed demand from the southern firms, and the closing price for 20-count Double Horse was 394 yuan and a half. The warehouse order also reached 390 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, the various firms bought 1,799 bales, and the market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The remaining prices fell by an average of 1 yuan or more. According to news from the factory, 85 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Ningbo yesterday. The amount purchased by each firm is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 1,015; Yunnan 310; Hong Kong 300</p>
<p>Shantou 55; Xiamen 5; Mainland 60</p>
<p>Ningbo 15; Wenzhou 19</p>
<p>Total: 1,799</p>
<p>Although the demand in the yarn market yesterday was sluggish, the market sentiment improved slightly. The current yarn price for 20-count Water Moon is 334.5 yuan, and the current yarn price for 20-count Blue Phoenix is 324.5 yuan, which is about 1 yuan higher than the price at the weekend. Recently, large players have both long and short positions, so the market sentiment is average.</p>
<h3>American Cotton: Factories are Requesting Samples</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was unexpectedly impacted by the failure of Smith's cotton industry proposal to proceed smoothly, and the various traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Southern traders were actively selling short, and the bulls took profits. As a result, the New York cotton market turned from sluggish to tired, falling by 5 to 6 pound coins. This year's Indian cotton is expected to have a poor harvest, and prices are difficult to fall. Yesterday, together with the forecast, it rose by another 1 Robi and a half. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 pound coins. There was no significant change in the exchange rate. Converted into legal currency, the price of cotton, calculated as American cotton and Brazilian cotton, fell by 3 jiao and a half per dan, Egyptian cotton fell by 1 yuan and a half, and Indian cotton alone rose by more than 6 jiao.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in the Shanghai market was exceptionally quiet yesterday, which was due to the failure of the yarn price to improve. The failure of Indian cotton to ship out on the appointed day may be the main reason why the factories are not ordering Indian cotton. There will be a turning point in the trading of American cotton. Recently, the factories have been requesting cotton samples from various foreign firms and are currently studying them for future reference. Shenxin Factory planned to purchase 1,000 pieces of Rangoon cotton yesterday, but the price difference was too great, and the reply has been forwarded and the transaction has not been completed. The cotton prices from yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Raw Material, Type, Delivered to Factory Including Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian cotton, High Grade, 110.50</p>
<p>Also, Medium Grade, 107.60</p>
<p>80-count, High Grade, 136.35</p>
<p>Also, Medium Grade, 126.05</p>
<p>20-count American Middling, 84.60</p>
<p>Also, Low Grade, 71.65</p>
<p>32-count, 93.05</p>
<p>Also, Low Grade, 82.50</p>

<p>32-count American Xinter, 83.35</p>
<p>32-count, 42-count American Pengapura, 87.7</p>
<h3>Tongzhou Cotton: Rises to 77 Yuan</h3>
<p>The business of local cotton is as dull as stagnation. The source is cut off, the war in the guerrilla areas of northern Jiangsu is intensifying, the road is difficult, and the transportation of goods is suspended. The arrival of goods is becoming increasingly rare. Those who hold goods generally see such an environment, and hoarding the goods in their hands is particularly strong. Therefore, the opening price of Tongzhou cotton has risen to a new price of 77 yuan, and the number of transactions is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Seeing this situation, the factory cannot help but take foreign cotton to make up for it. 329 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived on the Jiangbei Road in two days, and 3,000 pieces of Yao cotton arrived from Ningbo. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>American Packed Cotton, 86.00, Yufeng Factory Purchase, 200, Cash Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton, 77.20, Fellow Traders Purchase, 600 bales, Remittance for Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Xiasha Cotton, 75.00, Also, 150 bales, Also, Also</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Dyeing Material Use, This Street Slightly Developed, Eastern Cloth Fine Cloth Plummets</h3>
<p>The sales of national cloth are mixed, with ups and downs. Due to the continued handling of more than 200 packages of white fine cloth in the Wenzhou and Yongkou ports, and the lack of spot goods of Yong'an Factory's Dapeng fine cloth, they purchased Fugui and other brands, and the sales price was slightly firm, adding about 5 fen per piece. The current sales of fine twill are not good, and Xiang, Yue, and Zhejiang firms only handled 70 to 80 packages. However, the use of dyeing materials on this street has developed slightly, and 150 to 160 packages of various brands have been traded, and the selling price is stable. British firm Jardine Matheson's opening price for heavy and light weight coarse cloth was uniformly reduced by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece, converging with the hand goods sales price before the week. The opening price for various grades of coarse cloth from Chinese factories remained unchanged, and retail sales were sporadic. The price of light-colored bleached cloth is still firm. Jardine Matheson's Golden Three Pagodas bleached cloth rose by 1 jiao. Zhejiang Road's Wenzhou and Yongbo firms purchased more than 200 boxes of bleached cloth, bleached twill, foreign yarn, poplin, and colored cloth. Fujian and Shantou firms also purchased 200 or so boxes of the above-mentioned goods. Hunan firms handled more than 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and bleached twill. Sichuan and Yunnan firms had very little need because various goods were delayed too much in transit, and the number of new transactions was quite trivial.</p>
<p>The slump in white goods continued severely in the Eastern cloth morning market. The leading fine cloth once plummeted to 11 yuan and 6 jiao and a half. Then, dyeing material customers on this street took advantage of the low price to actively compensate, and more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill spot and futures goods were traded throughout the day, and the market price slightly stabilized. Hand goods were still willing to sell loosely, mixed and uneven, and still dropped 2 fen and a half and 5 fen per piece compared to the weekend. However, the large plates of the firms and factories have always been firm.</p>
<p>40 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>Woolen Industry Creates Another New Factory</h3>
<p>The local woolen industry used to have only a few companies such as Zhanghua, Xiexin, Dalong, Great Shanghai, and Daguangming. The British firm Jardine Matheson also existed. After the August 13th Incident, most of them, except for Jardine Matheson, suffered losses. Japanese firms took advantage of the opportunity to establish Yongxing Hongkang Factory in Hongkou. Outsiders and insiders are indistinguishable, and they all call it national goods. In fact, this is not the case. Because its price is cheap, Jardine Matheson and other goods have been greatly impacted. Recently, Chunhe and Yonghua, two new companies, and overseas Chinese who have returned to China have established a completely domestic woolen factory. Because it was established last year, it is named Ti Yinfeng, and its products are also sold by these two companies. Yesterday, it was heard that thick and thin serge, Haitian serge, Peng Yuanzhi yellow cloth, etc. have already been produced. Its quality is better than Yongxing Hongkang and others.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Market Speculation Begins to Subside Slightly</h3>
<p>The soaring prices of japonica and indica rice have been driven by rice merchants and vendors taking advantage of the opportunity to make trouble. In the past three days, the arrival of goods from various sources has gradually become smoother. Yesterday, 11 boats of Hexia goods arrived, and 4,000 to 5,000 packages of steamed buns were transported by truck. After the Soybean and Rice Industry Association repeatedly declared a price limit, although it was ineffective, and invited the Shanghai Municipal Council to set up a fair-price committee, speculators were somewhat concerned. Those who had pulled in a lot of goods in the past few days immediately returned them. The stores on this street are also waiting and seeing, the market has turned weak, and the prices of various goods have become clearer. As a result, the two japonica strains from the north and south have fallen by 2 to 3 jiao, and thin paddy high-grade goods have also fallen by 1 to 2 jiao. The middle-grade goods and Nanhang early rice have fallen by more than 5 jiao. Only the price of Bian Yuan goods is scarce and stable.</p>
<p>Guest indica rice has benefited, and the various warehouses are taking advantage of the high price to sell and the transshipment firms are waiting and seeing. New warehouses are standing by. The various firms on this street do not have a large appetite, so the total number of transactions for the day is only more than 1,000 packages. The market price has seen a sharp drop of 3 jiao due to floating households depreciating prices in order to sell. The highest price in Wuhu and Nanjing has dropped from 13 yuan and a half to 13 yuan and 2 jiao, and a small number of particularly high-grade goods have also been sold with the market. The price is slightly lower by more than 3 jiao. Because the recent rise in rice prices is not a real rice shortage, it is entirely due to people's psychology. Now that the guest warehouses have stopped, the market has fallen. The market says that the measure of imposing a price limit has been defeated without a fight.</p>
<h3>Flour Keeps Original Price, Foreign Flour Slightly Higher, Local Wheat Mutually Support, One Ship of Australian Wheat to be Unloaded This Morning</h3>
<p>There are no major changes in the flour market. The transactions of the guest firms have turned slightly active. In addition to handling No. 2 Chechuan brand flour, the northern firms are also paying attention to No. 3 and No. 4 Red God of Wealth and Red Peach Blossom flour. The transaction volume reached more than 20,000 bags. However, because the factory price of the southern firms is 5 fen higher than that of the northern firms, their appetite is not smooth, and only a few thousand bags have been decorated. The factory believes that the current supply of current flour is insufficient, and the price of foreign flour in yesterday's market is also higher. The exchange rate has shrunk, and the combined price has increased from 4 yuan to 4 yuan and 1 jiao per bag, so the selling price is not accommodating. As a result, the original price of 4 yuan and 7 jiao and 6 jiao and a half is still maintained.</p>
<p>The wheat market is still stagnant. The source is sporadic, and about 1,000 bags arrive every day. Most of them are directly sent to the factory for pricing, and there are Japanese flour mills secretly buying them. The market has an invisible secret increase, and it is rumored that the highest price is still 7 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. However, the various factories are currently paying attention to ordering foreign wheat, and futures transactions have been made repeatedly. The transaction of local wheat is very cold, so there is no formal agreement in the official market.</p>
<p>The British ship Rothley, carrying 8,881 tons of Australian wheat, arrived at the Songkou port yesterday afternoon. Because there is no space for floating barrels in the Pujiang Pier, it anchored outside the port. According to the agent of the ship yesterday, Qichang Warehouse in Pudong has a pier that can be relied on, so the ship is scheduled to enter the port at 6:00 this morning and dock at Qichang Warehouse for unloading.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Refined White Sugar Rises Another Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in imported sugar was relatively flat. The guild's trading range for second and fourth-grade white sugar, ex-godown, remained at $24.85 per picul. Transshipment goods were quoted at $16.70, but there were few transactions. Taikoo refined white sugar, West godown B mark, continued to rise five cents, trading at $24.70 for 50 bags. OW mark was at $24.60, CX mark at five cents, DY mark at four cents, and HX mark at three cents. There were no changes in H mark crystal sugar or imported crystal sugar. The domestic sugar market was stable. The Chaozhou merchants offered 65 bags of fine crystal sugar at $15.70, and about 30 bags of "Ti Zhuang Qing" (raised grade green sugar) at $15.50. "Shang Long Qing" (Upper Dragon Green) was bid up two cents to $13.70, but no deal was made. Xinghua "Da Gong Fen" (large palace powder sugar), especially high grade, was quoted at $24, and the next grade at $23.50. Zhangzhou "Diao Qing" (trick green sugar) is still being controlled. It is said that the production price has slightly fallen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 475 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong, and another 586 bags came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Jianning Mushrooms En Route, Production Price Rises $20</h3>
<p>A telegram from Fuzhou regarding Jianning mushrooms stated that the production price has risen $20 per picul, and high-quality thin mushrooms have also increased by $10, but the output is still low. It is reported that goods en route will arrive soon. However, demand from various merchant groups is strong, and sales prices are expected to increase.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Starch Stock Low</h3>
<p>The stock of tapioca starch here, such as the "West Head" brand, is almost exhausted. The quantity of other brands is also limited. The current market price for "Qiang Biao" (Spear Brand) is $18, up $1 from the previous market. "Fei Qi Lin Biao" (Flying Unicorn Brand) has also increased by two cents to $16.20.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Ningbo Goods Still Strong, Over 70,000 Pieces of Jianmu Timber Imported</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 60 pieces of tobacco leaves, 220 pieces of leather oil, and 780 pieces of fresh eggs were shipped from Ningbo. In addition, 71,900 pieces of wood planks arrived from Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: No Shantou Yeast, Jianning Yeast Popular</h3>
<p>Red yeast, due to Shantou's inability to export, has not been replenished for a long time. The current market supply is mostly Jianning yeast, so the price has risen nearly $10 from its previous low. High-grade is quoted at $60, and ordinary grade at $45 or $46. Sales are expected to increase further, with the possibility of another price rise.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Bitter Almonds - Source Cut Off</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the depletion of stocks in the production area of bitter almonds and the renewed restrictions on exports from Tianjin, the source has been cut off. Hong Kong merchants are still keen on buying, so the price has increased. For example, goods that were previously sold at $45 have now been traded for more than ten pieces at a price of $62 yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: Wenzhou Charcoal Floods the Market, Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Since Wenzhou charcoal was permitted for export, the current supply is plentiful. Warehouses in this city have a total of more than 20,000 dan (a unit of weight) in stock. Market sentiment is weak, and prices have eased off-market. The quoted price is $4.80 per dan for sturdy charcoal in large 45-pound baskets, and $3.30 for loose charcoal in ordinary baskets, down one or two cents from the previous price.</p>
<h3>Henan White Coal Off-Market Price Increasingly Firm</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai war, deliveries of Henan white coal have been interrupted for a long time. The market relies on a large batch of existing stock of more than 7,000 tons moved out of Pudong by a certain Tianjin firm for supply. However, the readily available goods are gradually being sold out, so the selling price is increasing daily. Yesterday, the off-market price was again firm, with Henan unified coal quoted at $44 per ton, screened lump coal at $46, and small pieces at $41, ex-warehouse. Handling fees are charged separately.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Soybean Oil Moves Against the Trend, Soybean Cake Futures Also Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for peanut oil and soybean oil showed mixed trends. Although there were reports of falling prices in Dalian for soybean oil, market sentiment was good, and both spot and futures prices rose by three to four cents. Spot Dalian oil was at 250 barrels (market price details in the market price column), March loading at 100 barrels, March delivery at 50 barrels, March at 100 barrels, April at 700 barrels, and Yantai oil at 200 pieces, including 200 baskets of Lianqi oil and 60 large baskets. Judging from the slightly divergent situation in peanut oil arrivals, its market is more likely to rise than fall. However, yesterday, the market saw profit-taking by bullish traders and rumors that its source might be able to be transshipped from Dalian, so market sentiment was dispersed, and the market saw a setback. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of $29, and 50 pieces of Jiancang oil were traded at a price of $29.20 on the old terms. 1,600 cans of Yantai canned oil were priced at $26.70, and 1,000 cans of Qingdao canned oil were priced at $38. There was some actual sales of soybean cake, with merchants from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Quanzhou buying 4,000 pieces of "Da You Si Pai" (Great You Four Brand) cake at a price of $3.45 and 500 pieces of "Wu Pai" (Five Brand) cake at a price of $3.24. 1,000 pieces of Jiangbei small cake were priced at $0.61. There were no significant fluctuations in the market. However, under the encouragement of market sentiment, Dalian futures cake rose by four cents, with 2,000 pieces for April delivery traded at a price of $3.234 and 1,000 pieces for May delivery traded at a price of $3.20.</p>
<h3>Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce in the Past Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Transfer of Shares</p>
<p>In the past year, a total of 307 industrial and commercial enterprises have transferred shares, including 51 factories and 256 commercial firms. Among these 307 transferred industrial and commercial firms, analyzed by industry and commerce, the food and beverage industry ranked first with 79 firms, followed by the clothing industry with 53, the daily necessities industry with 42, the metal and electrical industry with 30, the civil engineering industry with 12, the hygiene industry with 11, the cultural industry with 9, the pharmaceutical industry with 7, the travel industry with 6, and the decoration and entertainment industries each with 5, the finance and fuel industries each with 3, the transportation and special industries each with 2, and 34 firms with unspecified industries.</p>
<p>Comparing the number of transfer of shares companies by month, September ranked first with 46 companies, October second with 33, June third with 29, August and November fourth with 26 each, December fifth with 25, February and May sixth with 24 each, March seventh with 23, April eighth with 21, January ninth with 16, and July last with 14. It can be seen from this that the industries in which shares were transferred in the past year are related to the distorted development, which is to say various industries with superficial prosperity. Because of this, the transfer of shares of normal industrial and commercial enterprises only accounts for half of the total. The number of transferred shares by industry and month is listed in the following table:</p>

<h3>Gunfire Resounded All Night in Western Shanghai: Guerrillas Fiercely Attacked Puppet Troops, Wide Area of Operation, Puppet Troops Unable to Hold Out, Dispatch Heavy Troops to Reinforce Before Retreating</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, puppet "Pacification Army" troops have been stationed in the area of the Hongqiao Golf Club in recent days. Guerrillas launched an attack on the puppet troops last night (the 12th). The sound of rifles, pistols, and machine guns in the area continued intermittently throughout the night. The Japanese immediately dispatched heavy troops to reinforce them. As of 7:00 this morning, gunfire, possibly from the vicinity of the Jiefang Road outskirts, was still heard in the area.</p>
<p>Gunfire Erupted</p>
<p>The guerrillas began their attack at midnight. Pistol, rifle, and machine gun fire erupted from the puppet troops' sentry post on the other side of the Luo Bie Gen River, not far from Hongqiao Road. It is believed that the guerrillas set up a machine gun on the riverbank not far from the Golf Club and fired it. However, they apparently did not approach to attack, and the gunfire lasted for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>It Quietened Down</p>
<p>But at 4:20, more intense gunfire erupted from the direction of MacLeod Road, lasting for some time. The guerrillas then moved through the area, and gunfire erupted in many places near the area. The guerrillas apparently retreated due to the sound of approaching Japanese reinforcements. Intermittent gunfire continued until 7:00 in the morning, but it has now shifted westward. Last night's guerrilla operations occurred from the outskirts of Jiefang Road.</p>
<p>Wide Area of Operation</p>
<p>The extent of casualties is still unknown. At dawn, Japanese troops went to various villages in the area to search house by house. It is reported that some villagers were abused by the Japanese troops, with some being slapped and kicked. The "Pacification Army" that was attacked last night was recruited by the Japanese to guard various areas and "assist in restoring order." The puppet troops stationed on Hongqiao Road are either very young or physically weak.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Groups Decide to Maintain Original Price Limits, Price Assessment Committee to Be Established Regularly, Advise Merchants to Adopt Cooperative Attitude</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents and stabilize market prices, the city's rice industry groups held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 and organized a Rice and Grain Price Assessment Committee. Fifteen committee members were appointed, and the committee is scheduled to be established on the 15th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seven Groups Held Joint Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The city's Rice Industry Association and various merchant groups held a joint meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday on the second floor of the Grain Exchange. The participants included representatives from the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Merchants Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Rice Grain Distribution Industry Association, and from various merchant groups, including the Changshu Rice Industry Association, the Southern Merchants Association, and the United Rice Merchants Association, and other seven groups. The meeting was chaired by Cai Yukun, representative of the Bean and Rice Industry. The chairman first reported on the recent rise in rice prices in the Shanghai market, as well as the quantity of rice in stock and the sources in the interior. He stated that in order to maintain the food supply, the association should make its greatest efforts to regulate the rice and grain supply in the Shanghai market in the future, stabilize market prices, and achieve a satisfactory situation. During this extraordinary period, fellow merchants should be mindful of the difficulties and cooperate sincerely to maintain normal market transactions. Representatives from various groups, including Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Shi Zufuk, Jiang Shizhi, and Zhu Zixiang, expressed their opinions, elaborating in detail on the position of the merchants and the advantages and disadvantages of continued rice price increases.</p>
<p>Unanimously Agreed to Maintain Price Limits</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman summarized the opinions expressed by the various representatives. Regarding the rice price issue, it was decided to maintain the maximum price of $14 per picul. When secondary rice was considered separately, when the right to express opinions was voted on, more than 20 representatives present stood up and passed it unanimously. The market management committee was instructed to announce the decision of the joint meeting to the market so that the public could be informed.</p>
<p>Price Assessment Committee to Be Established Regularly</p>
<p>The joint meeting also decided to organize a Rice and Grain Price Assessment Committee consisting of representatives from the merchant groups, in order to stabilize rice prices and regulate the food supply. Based on the previously agreed price limit, the committee will assess prices at any time, following the established precedents for secondary grades. The committee will have 15 members, nominated as Chen Ziyu, Cai Yukun, Zhou Zhizhen, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Geng from the Bean and Rice Industry Association; Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Huang Zhuyuan, Pan Jibin, and Shi Hongdong from the Rice Merchants Association; Zhu Zhaoqi from the Rice Milling Industry Association; Yan Jiyun from the Southern Merchants Association; Shi Zufuk from the Changshu Rice Industry Association; Jiang Shizhi from the United Rice Merchants Association; and Zhang Songtao from the Rice Grain Distribution Industry Association. Fu Geng from the Bean and Rice Industry Association was appointed as the convener, and the committee is scheduled to be established on the 15th of this month at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the first committee meeting will be held. The organization of the committee should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions, and future price assessments should also be reported regularly.</p>
<p>Request to Relax Price Limits Rejected</p>
<p>When various rice industry groups held a joint meeting yesterday, some rice merchants requested a relaxation of the price limits, so the number of people attending was very crowded. It was heard that the decision not to allow a relaxation of the price limits and to assess prices at any time based on the previously agreed price limits was met with dissatisfaction by the general rice merchants. There are still about 600,000 dan of rice in stock in the Shanghai market, so there is no immediate cause for panic about shortages. The rice industry groups, in addition to making every effort to facilitate the supply, will also crack down on hoarding and speculation. Personnel have been dispatched to thoroughly investigate at any time. If manipulative activities are discovered, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>Patriotic Groups Warn Rice Merchants</p>
<p>According to information obtained by a reporter from the Modern News Agency from the rice industry, due to the soaring rice prices in recent days, off-market transactions have increased significantly. Although the association has made every effort to suppress it, the market situation is still chaotic. However, because it concerns the people's livelihood, all parties attach great importance to it. The Bean and Rice Industry Association suddenly received a warning letter from a patriotic group the day before yesterday, along with a detailed list of the names of companies manipulating the market. The letter hopes that the association will carefully plan regulatory measures to maintain the food supply and crack down on the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants to monopolize market prices at any time.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Member of the French Concession, Qi Laidun, Resigns, Succeeded by Ke Xuer</h3>
<p>Qi Laidun, a member of the Municipal Council of the French Concession, has resigned and been succeeded by Ke Xuer, a director of the Banque de l'Indochine.</p>
<h3>Labor Bureau Film Inspection Committee Member, He Deman, Resigns</h3>
<p>Mr. A. Hartmann, a member of the Film Inspection Committee of the Labor Bureau, has resigned due to his impending departure from Shanghai, and the Bureau has approved his resignation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Stationed in Shanghai Temporarily on Alert in Defense Zone Yesterday, Prevented Japanese Military Police and Any Troops from Entering, Japanese Side Protested to U.S. Military Authorities</h3>
<p>Around 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, plainclothes Japanese military police and naval personnel suddenly conducted some work at the residence of Shao Shijun, the "Director of the Puppet Unified Tax Bureau," at No. 39 Nanyang Road, in the U.S. military defense zone. When the U.S. naval authorities learned of this, they considered it an intrusion into the defense zone by the Japanese military police, infringing on sovereignty. At 10:30 a.m., they ordered a truckload of U.S. Marine Corps soldiers stationed in Shanghai to rush to the scene and drive away the Japanese military police, not allowing them to stay. Yesterday morning, the Japanese side again planned to send military police back into the area, but they were again prevented by U.S. troops, and no Japanese military units were allowed to pass through. At the same time, in order to prevent accidents, a temporary alert was announced, and additional U.S. troops were stationed along the road from Mud City Bridge to the area of the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai. The situation was quite tense. The Japanese side claimed that the Japanese military police's visit to Nanyang Road did not conflict with the U.S. defense force's sovereignty. Being prevented now was considered a deliberate insult, and it was heard that a protest would be filed with the U.S. defense force authorities, threatening to take stern action.</p>
<p>According to another report, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday, in the central area of the Public Concession, a U.S. small-caliber cannon military truck, equipped with six small-caliber cannons, ammunition boxes, etc., and escorted by about 30 artillerymen, patrolled the area within the defense zone, such as Maizhong Road, West Suzhou Road, Xinzha Road, Qingdao Road, Avenue Road, Baker Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Carter Road, Datong Road, Chengdu Road, and Mei Baker Road. In addition, a squad of infantry, about 20 men, carried light rifles with bayonets and backpacks, and patrolled along the Suzhou River before returning to camp at noon.</p>
<h3>Relaxation on the Outside, Tensions on the Inside: The Seriousness of the Concession Has Not Decreased, U.S. Military Protests to the Labor Bureau Are Untrue, the Japanese Side Continues to Exert Pressure Step by Step</h3>
<p>A notice from the Labor Bureau's information office stated that a news item in this morning's newspapers claimed that the recent understanding reached between the Bureau and the Japanese side regarding cooperation in investigating terrorist activities had caused a protest from the U.S. authorities. This news is untrue. During a recent search conducted in the U.S. military defense zone in accordance with the agreed compromise, there was an exceptional act. The U.S. authorities asked the Bureau to pay attention to this exceptional act, stating that it did not comply with the compromise. The Bureau has taken measures to prevent such acts from happening again.</p>
<p>There Are Three Ways the Japanese Exert Pressure</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Japanese side is currently exerting pressure on the Labor Bureau in three ways: (1) direct negotiations, (2) exerting pressure on the governments of relevant countries through diplomatic channels, and (3) instigating the "Great Way" municipal government to make continuous demands on the Labor Bureau and the consular body.</p>
<p>It is Reported That Xiao'an Made Requests to the French Consul</p>
<p>Pseudo-Shanghai "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an, recently instigated, in addition to making five unreasonable "requests" to the Public Concession Labor Bureau and the Shanghai consular body the other day, actually made three "requests" to the French Consul-General in Shanghai yesterday. The wording was absurd and bizarre. Excerpts from the "Protest Letter" are as follows: (1) The assassinations that have occurred are actually caused by the authorities of your concession accommodating Kuomintang and Communist rebels, allowing them to move freely within the concession and plot wrongdoing. Please ask the authorities of your concession to cooperate with this municipal government as soon as possible, and be sure to investigate the household registration. If there is evidence of party membership, all will be expelled from the country. Those who secretly possess firearms will be severely punished according to law. The main road intersections on the border between the Chinese territory and the Public Concession should be closely guarded and inspections should be strengthened in order to maintain security and eliminate the source of chaos. (2) The failure of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to be taken back under the jurisdiction of this government is also an important reason for the assassinations. This court is under the control and support of the Chongqing party government. Even if the rioters of the same front are arrested, they will never be fully punished according to law. Therefore, this government proposes that the president of the District Court and all prosecutors be replaced and replaced by officials appointed by the new government to comply with the system. (3) The Reorganization Government uses the five-color flag as the national flag. All areas under the control of the Reorganization Government should comply with the flag. However, the flag of the former party government, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag, is still displayed in your concession area. Therefore, people's hearts are thinking of chaos, and the evil atmosphere of the Kuomintang and Communist parties is growing stronger as a result. The impact on the hearts of the people and the national system is significant. Please prohibit the display of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag from the date of this document. If the prohibition is not added, then the authorities of your concession will be fully responsible for all accidents caused by the flag issue in the future. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Arresting Chinese and Handing Them Over Directly to the Japanese Side</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, according to news today (the 13th), since the Japanese authorities and the Labor Bureau concluded an agreement, Japanese plainclothes military police have been cooperating with the Public Concession patrolmen and arresting eight Chinese. It is heard that none of these eight people have had cases established with outwardly reliable evidence by the Public Concession security forces before being directly handed over to the Japanese authorities. Four of them were arrested in rooms 225 and 238 of the Mengyuan Hotel on Hubei Road at 9:00 p.m. on the 7th of this month. Another person was arrested at 6:00 p.m. the next day at No. 19, Lane 145, Guling Road. The sixth person was arrested on the 12th of this month at No. 3, Lifu Li, Chengdu Road. And at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, two more people were arrested in room 719 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. What crimes they were accused of has not been revealed. It is heard that although the Public Concession patrolmen assisted in the arrests, the interrogations were only carried out by the Japanese military police.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Committee: Wartime Relief, 9 Million Refugees Assisted</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the implementation of wartime disaster relief, the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee divided the area into eight relief zones for management. Each zone has a responsible authority, cooperating with local officials, police, and private relief</p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>To resolve difficulties and jointly handle regular relief for wartime refugees, special relief during emergencies, and work relief, etc. According to a recent announcement by the committee, it has spent 1.5 million national currency on the above relief, assisting 3.5 million refugees. In addition, refugees have received indirect relief from various provincial governments. The committee sends special commissioners to reside and handle relief work based on the needs of various provinces, or allocates funds to the provincial authorities for distribution.</p>
<p>This Expenditure</p>
<p>Also reached 2 million yuan. Regarding the handling of post-air raid relief, cash is given for the burial of the dead and the treatment of the injured. This expenditure was 357,000 yuan. However, the most difficult thing is the relief work in the war zone. Foreign church groups and international charitable organizations are making great efforts in this work. The total number of people assisted, including those directly receiving cash relief from the committee, is approximately 3.97 million. Those who are</p>
<p>Indirectly Assisted</p>
<p>Through local authorities is 2.83 million. In addition to the above number, it is estimated that there are 3 million refugees who have received assistance from private charitable organizations assisted by the committee. In total, the number of refugees assisted, directly and indirectly, should be more than 9 million. In addition, the committee sent personnel to investigate and distribute relief funds in the occupied areas close to the rear. According to people from Zhejiang Province, the Disaster Relief Committee in the winter of last year, in</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</p>
<p>Counties and towns along the line, such as Zhapu, Pinghu, and Haiyan, investigated the situation of refugees for a month. All issues relating to the accommodation, clothing, and food of the refugees were prepared in great detail. After the investigation, funds were allocated to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to be handed over to the special commissioners' offices in various districts for distribution. A total of more than 20,000 yuan was distributed, benefiting many refugees. Relief was also organized at the same time in the area around Shangjiang Fudian.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Association Asks Labor Bureau to Reconsider Tax Increase, Consumption Prosperity Is Difficult to Sustain, Tax Increase Makes Production Decline</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Labor Bureau yesterday regarding the Public Concession Labor Bureau Board of Directors' decision to increase the municipal general tax by 2% from October of this year. The letter states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to reports, your Bureau intends to increase the municipal general tax from 16% to 18% and the land tax from 8 per thousand to 9 per thousand from October 18th of the Republic of China, an increase of 1.25% each. This fact has been approved by the Board of Directors. The Association, due to its position, has no choice but to protest this proposal for the following reasons: (1) Regarding the current market, what is the true extent of its prosperity? Based on observations from many aspects, it is superficially prosperous, a prosperity of consumption rather than a prosperity of production, and it cannot be sustained. One of the three major principles of taxation is to promote production. Under these circumstances, increasing taxes will inevitably cause production to decline. (2) Water rises, boats rise; rivers rise, wells rise. This is a very common phenomenon. Public institutions that rely on public finance to maintain themselves are like boats and wells. The demand for real estate in Shanghai has increased rents, not only recovering the amount before the January 28 Incident in the 21st year of the Republic of China, but also greatly increasing it. The income from the municipal general tax and land tax has already followed this increase. However, this increase should be regarded as tidal. Now, in addition to the natural increase in tax revenue, an artificial increase is added, which will only accelerate the retreat of this tidal increase. (3) The prosperity of public institutions is the prosperity of the public. This is an iron law recognized by politicians, especially European and American politicians. The achievements of former British Prime Minister MacDonald and current U.S. President Roosevelt are deeply worthy of emulation. However, senior officials of public institutions have increased their salaries by more than 50% during this difficult period, claiming that it will stabilize their lives and allow them to focus on serving the public. But the taxpayers, who are in a precarious situation, are forced to live an unstable life and unable to focus on their careers due to the increase in taxes. Compared with MacDonald's example of taking the lead in cutting his salary by 1,000 pounds, is there any uneasiness in your hearts? In short, public institutions and the public are inseparable and share weal and woe. It is necessary to have mutual understanding and a spirit of hard work in order to bring about a better future. We hereby write to request that your Bureau reconsider the proposal to increase taxes. We are most grateful."</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company Plans to Increase Ships to Sail the Hong Kong-Burma-Singapore Route, Connecting Yunnan-Burma-Hong Kong Import and Export Cargo Transportation with the Collapsed Burma Air Route and Imperial Airways Route</h3>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, since the situation in South China changed, maritime transportation between China and Europe and America has gradually shifted from Guangzhou to Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam. The traffic between Hong Kong and Rangoon alone, due to the impact of the war, sees all goods shipped to China from Europe and America, and Chinese native products for export, being directly transported by ships to Hong Kong, and then transshipped to Haiphong and Rangoon, for transfer to Kunming, or transported from Kunming to Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong-Rangoon transportation line is becoming increasingly close, and the frequency of cargo transportation is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Increase Ships Sailing Hong Kong-Burma</p>
<p>Due to the Japanese monopolization of navigation in North China and the Yangtze River, foreign shipping companies have long paid attention to the Hong Kong-Burma route, as the ships that used to sail those routes have been suspended. In particular, British shipping companies, such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, whose ships have been suspended in North China and the Yangtze River, are now planning to increase and add ships to sail this route. As for other inland river shipping companies in Hong Kong and China, they are also rising to compete in order to develop their own businesses, and are determined to take the opportunity to sail the Hong Kong-Burma line. According to sources from Taikoo, the company is currently considering increasing the number of ships sailing this route, and it will be implemented as soon as the plan is completed, and it will be managed by the Hong Kong company.</p>
<p>Fallen Burma Air Route Implements Connection</p>
<p>According to a report from a Modern News Agency reporter stationed in Hong Kong, the China-Burma air route (flying between Chongqing and Rangoon) was launched from the fallen [area] on the 28th of last month. The aircraft used was a Douglas DC2, flown by Captain Shabi. In the future, there will be two flights per week, connected with Imperial Airways flights. It is noted that the route of the China-Burma flights follows the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Imperial Airways has already built a radio station and a temporary airport, and its public facilities have also been completed. China National Aviation Corporation has ordered two newly manufactured DC3 aircraft from the United States, worth US$250,000. These new aircraft, which can carry 24 people, will arrive in Hong Kong at the end of this summer, and their maximum speed is 230 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Displacement of Vessels Sailing to Ningbo: Notification from Jianghai Customs to Zhejiang Customs</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs received a notice from Zhejiang Customs regarding the re-implementation of restrictions on vessels sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo. The displacement restrictions are as follows: for steamships entering the Zhenhai port, those with a displacement of 15 to 16 feet are allowed to enter at low tide, and those with a displacement of 16 to 17 feet are allowed to enter at high tide. The length restrictions of the vessels will be handled in accordance with the previously promulgated regulations.</p>

<h3>Fallen Area Flooded with Japanese Goods; Imports Jump to First Place; Attempt to Dominate Trade in China, Interests of All Countries Plundered</h3>
<p>Japan is attempting to dominate trade in China after the war, with massive imports of Japanese goods being dumped in its occupied areas. The goods of the United Kingdom and the United States are affected. Procurement of native products must be authorized by Japanese procurement certificates. Major native products are controlled and shipped to Japan by ship. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan Dominates Trade in China</p>
<p>Japan is attempting to dominate trade in China by restricting the import of goods from third countries in its occupied areas, replacing the position of foreign businesses in its occupied areas with Japanese industries, and importing and dumping large quantities of Japanese goods. In addition, it refuses to open the Yangtze River and hinders navigation by third countries, resulting in Japanese goods flooding its occupied areas and the almost complete disappearance of British and American goods. Major native products, such as cotton, grains, leather, and wool, are purchased by large-scale companies and shipped to Japan to be used as raw materials. If merchants from third countries wish to purchase them, they must obtain approval from Japan and receive a procurement certificate. As a result, trade in China by the United Kingdom and the United States is greatly affected.</p>
<p>Dumping of Japanese Goods Causes Sharp Increase in Imports</p>
<p>Since August of last year, imports of Japanese goods have increased sharply, implementing its dumping policy. Imports in August were 23,825,000 yuan, in September they were 24,757,000 yuan, in October they were 20,625,000 yuan, in November they were 32,467,000 yuan, in December they were 27,574,000 yuan, and in January of this year they were 26,710,000 yuan. In each of the above months, imports of Japanese goods ranked first. The goods are mostly cotton cloth, rayon, machinery, hardware, seafood products, daily necessities, sugar, wine, books, maps, wooden paper products, wood, stone, soil, and groceries.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States are Affected</p>
<p>Before the war and at the beginning of the war, the United States ranked first in import trade to China, followed by Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Since August of last year, imports of Japanese goods have jumped to first place, the United States has fallen to second place, and the United Kingdom, Germany, France, etc., have gradually faded. This proves that the trade of various countries with China has been greatly affected by the dumping of Japanese goods and the restriction of imports of goods from third countries, causing greater damage to the interests of merchants from third countries in China than in any previous era. Therefore, merchants from various countries believe that if sanctions are not imposed, merchants from third countries in the Japanese-occupied areas will be unable to continue operating. Fortunately, foreign goods are still sold as usual in non-occupied areas.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Withdraws 100,000 Yuan to Prepare a Fund</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently hosted some of the heads of the shelters, where the association's Deputy Secretary-General and Director of Aftercare Wei Bozhen, Deputy Directors Li Wenjie and Chen Xianmo, and Secretary Li Baiqiang, explained the importance of aftercare work. Representatives from each shelter expressed their opinions and discussed them in detail. It is reported that the association's board of directors has resolved to withdraw 100,000 yuan to be used as an aftercare equipment fund, and will also hold a fundraising for a refugee production education fund to actively promote refugee production work and turn dividends into profits.</p>
<p>Clothing Industry: Since the establishment of the Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group, industry associations have enthusiastically supported it to facilitate relief efforts. The Clothing Industry Association has raised 1,182 yuan from all its members, including Wang Xingchang, Xinfeng, and Hechang, and reported to the association, which transferred it to the Relief Association yesterday.</p>
<p>Soy Sauce and Wine Industry: The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Soy Sauce and Wine Industry held a fundraising committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at No. 10 Zhenhou Lane, Xiamen Road, to discuss active fundraising methods. More than ten committee members, including Chen Zhenlin, Zhang Lianyuan, Zhang Jiefu, and Hu Benxin, attended. After discussion, it was resolved: (1) to add Yu Rupin and Chen Zhenlin as standing committee members to supervise and promote the fundraising work; (2) to continue to hire Wan Tai's Yu Weiliang, Wan Mao's Gu Weiqin, Yu Yuan's Chao Zhimei, Li Xing's Ye Huiqin, Wan Zhen's Pan Yunbo, Ding Shun's Cai Langfu, Wan He Shun's Cao Guo, Lao Tong Yu's Dong Yaoshan, Xin Wan Kang's Gao Peide, Lao Wan Shen's Cheng Chenfu, Zi Da Chang's Ni Yangzhou, Fuxing's Sun Wu, and Wan Yuan Shun's Shi Youqing as sponsoring committee members to assist in soliciting donations from their respective industries, in order to raise more funds than expected for refugee relief.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rickshaw Association Urges Wheel Modification, Introduces Vehicle Dealers for Loan Installation Fees Due to Inability to Afford Modification Costs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association held a meeting of its standing directors yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Shen Yong, Ke Huaxin, and Ge Futian. Shen Yong chaired the meeting, and the following matters were resolved: (1) Starting from the 16th of this month, members will be dispatched to investigate member vehicles and urge the modification of 2-inch wide iron edges; (2) For members who are unable to afford the cost of modifying iron wheels, the association will introduce vehicle dealers to provide loan installation fees; (3) Members are notified to prepare to modify their wheels and must complete the modification before the deadline of July 1; (4) Continue to handle member registration, compile a member roster, and submit it to the Public Works Department for record; (5) A joint meeting of directors and supervisors will be held on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death: French Concession Forbids Displaying Flags, Considers County Flags to Have "Political Nature" and Should Be Intervened with According to French Concession Regulations</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that although personnel of the Public Concession did not interfere with the display of the Chinese national flag yesterday (the 12th) to commemorate the 14th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the municipal authorities of the French Concession did not allow the display of the Chinese national flag. A senior official of the French Concession Municipal Council told reporters that the French Concession has regulations regarding the display of flags, but the official explained that the French Concession only interferes with the display of Chinese flags related to "political activities." In view of the declaration issued by the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in this city urging the people of Shanghai to display flags as part of the commemorative ceremony, the display of Chinese flags this time is purely "political." It was heard yesterday afternoon that French Concession police entered Chinese houses and ordered the removal of national flags in several cases. The police entered a house near the Great World and ordered the owner to remove the flag, which aroused a considerable number of onlookers.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week: Today is Farmers' Propaganda Day; Participate in Guerrilla Warfare, Strive for Agricultural Affairs, and Vigorously Implement the National Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>Today is the Farmers' Propaganda Day of the Second Anti-Japanese War's First Propaganda Week in Shanghai. Shanghai farmers' organizations have issued a letter to all fellow farmers in the city. The full text is as follows: Dear fellow farmers in the city, the farmers of China are the most revolutionary. Throughout history, those who rebelled against oppression and raised the banner of uprising were mostly farmers. In China's anti-Japanese war, farmers are of course a main force. Look at the soldiers currently fighting on the front lines, most of them come from the fields, and the continuous replenishment also comes from the peasant masses. In the later stages of the anti-Japanese war, in terms of troop replenishment, farmers are the main body. In terms of the occupied areas, farmers are the only basic force for recovering lost territories. The four-month bloody battle of Shanghai two years ago aroused the enthusiasm of farmers in the city to resist Japan and save the country. Everyone dropped their hoes, either joining the army and splattering the enemy with their blood, or organizing battlefield service teams to transport weapons, military rations, intelligence, and build defense works. Even ordinary women automatically took on the cooking and comforting tasks for the army. The enemy's artillery fire can destroy our fields, but it cannot destroy our determination to resist Japan. On the contrary, the more intense the enemy's artillery fire, the higher our anti-enemy sentiment. Although Shanghai has fallen, our farmer friends have always guarded the inch of land left by our ancestors and fought the most arduous and heroic struggle. However, upon careful review, although past efforts have achieved considerable results, they are still not enough. It must be known that at this critical moment of national life and death, the contributions of the people of the whole country to the country should exceed all historical precedents. On the negative side, we should endure all the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure. On the positive side, we should unleash our highest degree of potential strength and deal with the enemy to the end. Now, I list five things as the common goals of our farmer compatriots at present: 1. Participate in guerrilla warfare. From one village to one town, to one township and one county, all adults should be gathered together to form guerrilla teams. The tasks of the guerrilla team are approximately four points: (1) ambush the enemy; (2) eliminate traitors; (3) protect production and its circulation; (4) strengthen political training. 2. Engage in production. Farmers in guerrilla areas, except those who are not controlled by the enemy, must not abandon farming in addition to guerrilla work, in order to maintain the supply for long-term operations. 3. Non-cooperation movement. We should adopt non-cooperation in the economic sphere with enemies and traitors: (1) refuse to use counterfeit currency; (2) refuse to pay taxes; (3) absolutely do not provide the enemy with manpower or material resources; (4) refuse the penetration of enemy goods into the guerrilla area. 4. Follow government orders. Farmers should absolutely follow the orders of the administrative organs established by the government in the guerrilla area in order to consolidate the strength of the anti-Japanese war and national construction. 5. Vigorously implement the National Spiritual Mobilization. The National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures recently promulgated by Chairman Chiang should be earnestly followed in order to achieve the highest goal of national construction based on the Three People's Principles. The above five points are all urgent tasks for our farmer friends today. In order to defend our homeland, in order to strive for the independence, freedom, equality, and peace of our country and nation, we must follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and vow to fight the enemy to the death. Shanghai is the enemy's rear headquarters. We will not only not allow him to control it, but also fundamentally take it back.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Host Press, Report Transfer Process</h3>
<p>Sixty-five postal workers from the Shanghai Post Office who were transferred to the southwest hosted a tea reception for the press yesterday, reporting the truth about this unfair transfer and the negotiations of the transferred postal workers. (According to the postal regulations, Class B postal workers are not transferred out of the postal area, so the transferred workers requested to be used as reserves, and after the war, they would return to serve in the Shanghai postal area.) They called on the media to provide assistance and stated that Chinese employees were being transferred and Japanese employees were being employed (the recently employed Japanese employees were not tested and were called non-ranked postal workers, with a monthly salary of 262.5 yuan), which caused a serious crisis in the postal service. Representatives from the press delivered speeches, praising the postal workers' enthusiasm for serving the country, and promised to do their best to support the postal workers' negotiations in order to achieve a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Leaders of Northern Jiangsu Guerrilla Force, Qu Du and Wang Jin, Martyred; Murdered by Someone, Public Mourns and Friends Hold Memorial Service</h3>
<p>According to visitors from Northern Jiangsu, Qu Du and Wang Jin, leaders of the guerrilla war in Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Chongming counties, were unfortunately assassinated on January 10 of this year in Hexing Town, Qidong, by Zhang Nengren, the former commander of the [blank] detachment stationed in the town. Their bodies were abandoned in the fields, and later collected by the martyrs' families. At that time, the people of Qidong and Haimen mourned over the bodies, and those who mourned numbered no less than 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>Since the successive fall of Tong, Hai, Chong, and Qi in March and April of last year, the people have suffered greatly. Commander Qu Du immediately destroyed his family and started an uprising in his native Chongming, and began to organize guerrilla troops. In the Battle of Shituo Port, he gave the enemy its first defeat. Martyr Wang Jin was originally studying at [blank] University in Shanghai. In the autumn of last year, he joined the troops of Martyr Qu and engaged in organizing the people and developing guerrilla warfare. He fought five battles against the Japanese army and captured many prisoners, repeatedly making outstanding achievements. He swept away the public's fear of Japan, and recovered the county seat of Qidong. The military and civilians were in harmony, and the people of Northern Jiangsu spoke highly of him. As a result, the two-faced elements in the area harbored great jealousy, leading to the incident on January 10, which killed our national hero. Everyone lamented his death.</p>
<p>Also, the friends of Martyrs Qu and Wang held a memorial service yesterday, attended by more than 200 guests. The white cars and horses showed the extreme grief of the moment. It was also heard that the friends of Martyrs Qu and Wang organized a Qu and Wang Martyrs Memorial Committee for the sake of permanent commemoration. At that time, the memorial methods were determined, such as: (1) sending representatives to comfort the martyrs' families; (2) compiling a commemorative album of Qu and Wang Martyrs and arranging their posthumous works; (3) developing the undertakings operated by Qu and Wang Martyrs during their lifetime; (4) preparing scholarships; (5) the problem of the tombs of the two martyrs.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Garrison Command Forbids the Export of Able-Bodied Men</h3>
<p>According to Ningbo News, since the headquarters of the 3rd Army Group issued the Provisional Navigation Measures for Eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Ningbo line has resumed direct navigation. There are special provisions for passengers entering and exiting, and they must hold travel permits. Able-bodied men of the right age are strictly prohibited from exporting. If it is necessary to export due to important matters, the travel permit may also be given at discretion after the county government of the original place of origin has verified the authenticity. However, two wealthy shops with more than 2,000 yuan must be guaranteed to guarantee their return to their place of origin for conscription within a limited period of time. If there is an intention to escape conscription and affect government affairs, it is not a simple matter. The Ningbo Garrison Command Inspection Office, which is now responsible for inspecting the ports, has issued a notice that any able-bodied men who have not obtained a certificate and try to export in a muddled way will be sent to the military service immediately upon discovery, whether or not they are selected for military service, as a warning and to deter others from following suit.</p>
<h3>First Special City Federation Discusses Important Cases, Reports Rice Merchants for Manipulation, Asks for Exemption from Municipal Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizen Federation held its 103rd Executive Committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Association Building on Jiangxi Road. Zhang Yi'ao chaired the meeting, and the following matters were resolved: (1) The price of rice in the city has recently risen to the limited price and seems to continue to rise, which is a matter of people's food. A solution should be sought quickly. It was resolved: 1. Send a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association to earnestly implement the resolution to maintain the limited price. 2. Notify the district branches to investigate the rice sales situation in their respective areas. 3. Welcome citizens to report unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate, or raise prices. 4. Send a letter to the authorities of the two concessions to properly plan the welfare policy of rice for the citizens and make preparations in advance. (2) At the time of emergency, all industries and businesses are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Citizens should be advised to work hard in production and practice thrift. Resolved, passed. (3) The Public Concession Public Works Department decided to increase the municipal general tax by 2% starting from October 1 of this year. Resolved: the municipal general tax of the Public Concession has already been increased once after the war, that is, from the tax rate of 14% to 16%. Now, the tax is increased by 2%, that is, the tax rate is increased to 18%. In view of the economic situation after the war, it is really unbearable. The Public Works Department should be asked to consider the current difficulties and withdraw the proposed increase in tax, and the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession should be asked to strive for negotiation. (4) The association previously considered that housing rent disputes within the boundary were quite serious, and organized a Residence Problem Committee to conduct mediation. Since the handling, it has been quite effective. Now, this type of dispute has been significantly reduced. In order to save expenses, it is proposed to end the Residence Problem Committee. Resolved, the Residence Problem Committee is approved to end its operations from today. If there are housing rent disputes between members in the future, the association will handle them directly. (5) The association intends to hold a citizen's group wedding to promote thrift in marriage. Resolved, passed.</p>
<h3>Delivering Mail Must Recognize Sections; Of the Postal Branches, About Sixteen Districts Are Open; Eleven Districts Not Yet Restored</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, some of the postal branches in the city, such as Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong, were forced to stop working, and were moved to the General Post Office on North Suzhou Road. Because the public is not familiar with the situation of each postal branch, they often deliver mail to areas that are not open for mail delivery, causing proper mail to be delayed or lost. In the future, when delivering mail, the sections must be identified. The open and unopened areas of each district postal office are listed as follows: About sixteen districts are open, including Jilu Road, Ximen, Lan Ni Du, Jing'an Temple, Cade Road, Xujiahui, Kandi Road, Roberts Road, Jiangxi Road, North Railway Station, Seymour Road, City Center Area, Bailinan Road, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, and Dong Youheng Road. About eleven districts have not resumed postal delivery, including Nanshi Bund, Li Ma Road, Da Nanmen, Longhua, Gaochang Temple, Zhongshan Road, Lao Bei Men, Sichuan Road, West Huade Road, Zhabei, and Baoding Road. Each branch has detailed regulations for the time of sending and receiving letters. However, those who send letters at the branch must do so earlier so that the time of sending and receiving corresponds to that of the General Post Office.</p>
<h3>Various Industry Associations Notify Members to Check Books and Records and Affix Stamps According to Law; Penalties Increased During Extraordinary Times; Failure to Affix Four Cents Results in a Penalty of Twenty-Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various industry associations in the city notified their affiliated stores, companies, and factories, saying, "Dear sirs, regarding the use of stamp tax tickets by businesses in the city, since the intermediate shutdown and subsequent resumption, it seems that they have not paid as much attention as before, resulting in many cases where stamps should have been affixed but were not. The mistake lies in the fact that some merchants believe that there have been no penalties for stamp cases in the city for a long time, and they are inevitably taking it lightly. If this kind of erroneous psychology is not corrected, the result of negligence and failure to affix stamps will inevitably lead to losses due to penalties. Moreover, during extraordinary times, the penalty method for failure to affix stamp tax tickets is more severe than usual. For example, each account book should now be affixed with four cents. If it is not affixed, it will be punished at 60 times the rate, so each book should be fined 24 yuan. If there are multiple account books that are not affixed, and the penalties are combined, it should not exceed the maximum amount of six times, which can result in a combined penalty of up to 144 yuan. This is a very painful experience for small businesses. The association specially informs all businesses that for all books and records established before today, if there are any unattached or insufficiently attached stamps, they should immediately check and attach them one by one. For documents that have been issued, if they can still be recovered for attachment, it is also best to attach them. From now on, all kinds of account books and documents should be carefully checked at any time to purchase and attach the correct number of stamps. If it comes to the time of punishment, then even if you want to complete it by affixing the stamps, you will not be able to do so."</p>
<h3>Fu Xiao'an Still Trying to Cling to His Position, Asks for a Delay in Change on the Pretext of Debts Owed to Public Funds</h3>
<p>Since Fu Xiao'an took office as "Mayor" five months ago, the wind of corruption has become rampant, arousing dissatisfaction from Japanese special agencies, which intend to remove him and promote Su Xiwen, the current pseudo-"Secretary-General," to take his place. However, after the news was revealed, several people, including Chen Yi, the former pseudo-"Commissioner of the Government," Lu Ying, the current pseudo-"Police Chief," and Wu Wenzhong, the pseudo-"Director of the Social Affairs Bureau" and the pseudo-"Director of the Judiciary Office," also sought to curry favor for this puppet position, and have been very active in lobbying the Japanese special agencies and the pseudo-"Reformed Government" in Nanjing. While various parties were participating in the competition, it was suddenly discovered that Chuan Xiao had misappropriated as much as tens of thousands of gold from the pseudo-"Public Funds," which was difficult to turn over. As a result, an unexpected problem arose. If Fu stepped down, the misappropriated funds would be difficult to recover, and Su Xiwen also insisted that he would not rashly take over unless Fu returned all of the pseudo-"Public Funds." In desperation, Fu Xiao'an took a car to Ningbo on the 4th of this month and begged Liang Hongzhi and others to help him maintain his pseudo-position. He would repay the pseudo-"Public Funds" he owed month by month, with the clear intention of not leaving the pseudo-position or repaying the debts. Liang and others also felt difficult to cope with and had no choice but to intercede with the Japanese special agencies, on the pretext that the pseudo-"Diplomatic" situation was tense and senior puppets should not be transferred. On the one hand, Fu was ordered to stay in the pseudo-position and quickly repay the debts to clear the accounts before proceeding with the replacement. It is heard that the Japanese side is temporarily accepting the intention of the pseudo-"Renovation," so Fu Xiao'an's pseudo-position may still be retained for three or four months, while Su Chen Lu Wu and others failed to win the game. It is also learned that the pseudo-"Municipal Government" added a pseudo-"Foreign Affairs Section" on the pretext of terrorist incidents to handle pseudo-"Diplomacy," and newly appointed Chen Gongzhan and Gu Damin, two traitors, to jointly handle it.</p>
<h3>Management of the Clearing House, Discount on Wire Transfer Bills, Preventing Speculators from Monopolizing Profits</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new wire transfer bill system after the war, ordinary speculative merchants were actually handling discounts, attempting to make huge profits, so that the discount rate once rose to 70 yuan. Later, the bank clearing house came forward to maintain it and gradually stabilized after large-scale transfers. Since January of this year, after the exchange officially announced the buying and selling market every day and formally managed it, the discount rate has stabilized. Now the office has decided to continue to manage it to prevent monopolistic profiteering by speculators.</p>

<h3>The Reasons for and Remedies for Marital Tragedy</h3>
<p>A monogamous marriage is the best family system in civilized society. A couple, both strong and healthy, each fulfilling their functions, the man plowing and the woman weaving in rural society, or the man going out to manage business or industry and the woman managing the household in urban society, with marital love that is considerate and tender, and children born lively and intelligent, this is naturally a harmonious and healthy family. This kind of healthy family, not only do the husband and wife enjoy happiness and well-being, but it is also a good and stable foundation for society, and is of great importance to the nation and the country. According to our physiological and psychological research, a couple, each united as husband and wife due to their physiological needs, should live in harmony, with deep love, enjoying a life of bliss, so why does tragedy occur in the family?</p>
<p>Although there are many reasons for family tragedies, apart from men being too greedy, taking a concubine in addition to a wife, or secretly keeping a mistress, there is the saying, "If you want your family to be disharmonious, take a concubine." In addition to the chaos of having too many women, the most common cause is the decline of male virility. According to our research on female psychology, unless she does not marry him, if she marries him, she will give him her entire body and mind. As long as he can give her sufficient joy and comfort, she will feel that he is the only one in her life who understands her, hence the saying, "A devoted woman loves a heartless man," women are mostly devoted. However, if a man commits self-abuse and nocturnal emissions in his early years, or indulges in debauchery after marriage, leading to depletion of essence and blood, resulting in morbidity in sexual function, and in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, he often feels headache and brain pain, forgetfulness and insomnia, tinnitus and blurred vision, restlessness, back pain, and fatigue, etc. In marital life, how can such a man receive his wife's passion? Passion being deceived is a heart-wrenching thing! If she is sacrificed for a long time, how can she not become angry and ashamed! Leading to all kinds of tragedies in the family! In today's society, it is often heard that wives have relationships with others, or openly confront their husbands in court, righteously suing for divorce. When a husband suffers such a tragedy, can one not shed tears if one puts oneself in his shoes and imagines the pain in his heart? At the same time, due to physical weakness, how can he withstand such severe stimulation? If he is excessively worried and sad, he may become prematurely senile or even die young!</p>
<p>However, we know that for intelligent men, the above-mentioned symptoms are not incurable. If treated symptomatically, health can be restored. According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, it is generally recognized that taking the male hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" is the most effective treatment. This preparation can generate sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. If taken continuously, it can completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Hymeto Spermatostasis Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, which will yield even faster results.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission is the Most Harmful Disease</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Because semen is the source of our lives, nocturnal emission is the most harmful disease. Now, let us analyze it in the following aspects: The semen in a person's body is extracted from the most valuable nutrients in food, and then produced by the testicles and flowed into the seminal vesicles through various wonderful physical and chemical actions in physiology. If the flow is too much, it will indeed show excessive sperm discharge. Approximately healthy, unmarried, and adult men have it once or twice a month. This is physiological and cannot be considered pathological. However, many people engage in masturbation due to sperm overflow, or develop pathological nocturnal emission due to masturbation or other mental fantasies, which should be carefully prevented. In short, unless it is physiological sperm overflow and legitimate sexual intercourse after marriage (but one must not be licentious, as licentiousness also has various drawbacks), if semen can be richly retained in the body, it is of great benefit to the body. Because it functions to regulate metabolism, promote development, nourish nerves, and strengthen the brain and kidneys to enhance energy. If a young person has nocturnal emission, or if nocturnal emission deteriorates into spermatorrhea, the semen in the body cannot be stored, and the essence will be depleted and the blood will be exhausted. Therefore, metabolism will be reduced, and in the various tissues of the body, only old cells die and very few new cells are produced, resulting in a sallow complexion and emaciation, and reduced vitality. If this continues, one may become prematurely senile, and development may be hindered, resulting in a short stature and small genitals, like a child. In addition, in the brain, spinal cord, and three major nerves related to sex, there will also be symptoms of weakness, often with poor brainpower, forgetfulness and insomnia, tinnitus and blurred vision, back pain, and fatigue. Kidney deficiency leads to impotence and scattered energy. Moreover, the constant leakage of semen cannot be produced physiologically, resulting in a lack of sperm in the semen, or even none at all, leading to infertility... From all of this, we can know that nocturnal emission is not only harmful to the body, but also leads to infertility, how dangerous it is! As for sexual weakness, which makes marital life unsatisfactory, it will create the most miserable tragedy in life! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only treatment for this disease is to take "Hymeto Spermatostasis Tablets," which is the most effective. After taking it, it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, eliminate evil thoughts, and nocturnal emission can be eradicated immediately. However, if nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, one must also take the hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" to supplement the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, regulate metabolism, and promote development. If taken continuously, one can completely restore health as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Look! How Important are the Breasts</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Actually Controls a Woman's Life and Fate</p>
<p>"No matter how good a peony is, it all depends on the support of the green leaves." No matter how beautiful a woman is, if she does not have a pair of towering breasts and plump hips to fully reveal her curvy beauty, then even if you wear a splendid embroidered robe (cheongsam), wear precious ornaments, leather shoes and silk stockings, and apply lipstick and eyebrow makeup, it will still feel incomplete, just like a peony without green leaves. Not only in social situations, can you not look around proudly and show your health and beauty, and be secretly ridiculed, but also in the private life between husband and wife, ask yourself what your feelings will be when a flat and boundless strange appearance first catches your husband's eyes? What will your husband's feelings be? I know that even if your husband doesn't say it to your face, his love for you will gradually cool down, or he may even go out and sing and dance, and stay with prostitutes. Although you are very unhappy, you can only suffer in your heart and be depressed because you think of your own shortcomings. Not only that, but as a result of breast atrophy, the function of the ovaries, which is related to the entire health of women, will inevitably be impaired, and the metabolic power will also lose its alternating effect. As a result, irregular menstruation, sticky leukorrhea, cold uterus and infertility, and weakened libido will inevitably follow, leading to difficult childbirth and never having a child in one's life. Even if you have millions of assets, you can only hand them over to others. Thinking of this, the breasts are really of great importance to a woman's happiness.</p>
<p>Then, is there really no way to make up for this kind of defect? That's not the case. According to the unanimous opinion of world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kantelin and gynecologist Tang Posheng, if a woman suffers from breast atrophy, small buttocks, irregular menstruation, excessive leukorrhea and infertility, and weakened libido, she can take the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductive Element" invented by Austrian Dr. Standard, which is the most effective treatment. This preparation extracts the essence of healthy animal ovaries and is scientifically refined. Just imagine: supplementing the impaired ovarian function of women with the essence of healthy animal ovaries, it is no wonder that it can exert great medicinal power within one day and night after taking it, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leukorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can gradually make atrophied breasts tower and slender buttocks become plump, and it can also increase blood circulation, allowing white skin to reveal a bright red glow from moisturized and fair flesh.</p>

<h3>What is the Easiest Way to Completely Cure Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>It is generally known that gonorrhea is difficult to treat, but in fact, it is also a disease that is easy to treat. The symptoms of gonorrhea are intricate and varied, and the methods for treating gonorrhea are also different, both old and new. Old doctors have never seen what gonorrhea is, so naturally they cannot talk about any treatment methods. However, even general new doctors often find gonorrhea difficult to handle. In fact, it is not the case. Gonorrhea is easy to treat in its early stages, but if the disease is not deep and the treatment method is not appropriate, then this easy-to-treat acute gonorrhea will inevitably become chronic gonorrhea. How many people in the world suffer from chronic gonorrhea, and all of them have gone through acute gonorrhea. Therefore, it is not appropriate to say that acute gonorrhea is easy to treat. However, it is not appropriate to say that chronic gonorrhea is difficult to treat in general. In the past ten years, I have cured no less than several thousand people with chronic gonorrhea. If it is difficult to treat, how can I have so many confirmed cures, and many have been proven by the Public Works Department Health Bureau to be free of gonococcus and have never relapsed. In short, the treatment of acute and chronic leukorrhea, if the diagnosis is accurate and the treatment method is correct, are all easily treatable venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Now, let me take acute prostatitis and urethral stricture in chronic gonorrhea as examples. Acute prostatitis. After accurate diagnosis, a specially made autologous vaccine can be injected, and cooling or warming methods such as anal cooling or enema and suppository methods can be used depending on the symptoms. Acute prostatitis swelling can be reduced within one or two days. For gonococcal stricture, the new-style Davies' device can be used for painless urethral dilation. If the bladder has residual urine retention and is full and about to burst, surgery can be performed quickly to drain the urine to prevent uremia. At this time, it all depends on the doctor's quick hands and eyes, so that the extremely dangerous gonorrhea can be cured in a very short period of time. For these symptoms, flat-flow electrolytic therapy is particularly effective in terms of electrotherapy. For all acute and chronic gonorrhea, if general mediocre treatments and doctors with limited knowledge are used, a cure cannot be obtained in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Specialty: Also treats syphilis, bubo, chancre, and painless new method circumcision.</p>

<h3>Li Pinquan, Shareholder of a Gambling Den, Suspected of Murder</h3>
<p>The case of Li Xing's thugs beating Chinese police officers continued to be heard yesterday, with a verdict to be announced on the 17th</p>
<p>Four shooting incidents in western Shanghai were related to Li</p>
<p>Li Pinquan, a native of Nanjing and shareholder of the Guangsheng Company gambling den on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai, saw a rickshaw parked on the side of the road outside the alley of the gambling den on the 14th of last month. Believing that it was obstructing the entry and exit of gamblers, he used his power to bully the rickshaw puller. At that time, Chinese police officer No. 2549 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who was on patrol, saw the gang causing trouble along the way and went to stop them. Unexpectedly, Li relied on his special influence to order the bodyguards of the gambling den, who are known as "leg huggers," and his thug Wu Xiufeng, a native of Jiangbei, to forcibly drag the police officer into the nearby alley, which was beyond the jurisdiction of the Concession police, and</p>
<p>indulge in violence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the police officer immediately fired a shot in self-defense. Neighboring officers heard the sound and rushed to the scene, and together they arrested Li and Wu and sent them to the First Special District Local Court for trial. Because the police station believed that Li had committed other crimes and needed to be investigated, they ordered him to be detained pending further investigation. It has been reported in previous reports that the police station has now found that a murder case did occur on October 9 of last year, and the location was in the countryside of "Luxizhai" in the former Shanghai Police Bureau's Sixth District of western Shanghai, which is close to Bailinan Road in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Shot to death</p>
<p>were named Zhu Laowu and a Mr. Chen, and Lu Xiaoquan was also injured by stray bullets. The cause of the case seemed to be a vendetta. Li Pinquan (also known as Li Wu) and Zhu Laowu had always been on good terms. During the chaos of the Shanghai war, they used extraordinary means to seize a large amount of bamboo, which was sold for a considerable profit. Li received several thousand gold dollars in stolen money, but since then, he and Zhu had a deep grudge. Later, Zhu and Chen both joined the "Tax Agency" of the puppet organization and served as "boat tax" collectors, extorting money from boat households on the west end of the Suzhou River. On that day, Zhu and Chen, together with one</p>
<p>Fang Haiqing</p>
<p>, scraped up "donation" money from the boat households and returned home with full pockets to pay tribute to their "master." When passing Luxizhai, four thugs suddenly emerged and shot at Zhu and Chen, killing them on the spot. Lu happened to be passing by and was caught in the crossfire. A few days ago, the police station sent detectives to summon Lu Xiaoquan, who had recovered from his injuries, and another passerby, Chen Bangda, to the police station to investigate the situation at that time. Lu said that he was injured by stray bullets on that day and did not know who the murderer was. Chen said that he heard gunshots and immediately ran away, so he also did not know</p>
<p>who the murderer was</p>
<p>Later, the detective found Fang Haiqing and, after detailed interrogation, Fang confessed that he had a considerable relationship with both Li and Zhu. When Li obtained the stolen bamboo material money, he was also given ten yuan by Li as the price for keeping the matter a secret. On that day, he was traveling with Zhu and Chen, etc. When he heard gunshots and looked back, Zhu and Chen had already been killed and fallen to the ground. At that time, Li Wu (that is, Li Pinquan) was indeed at the scene, and one of the four murderers was Li Wu's son, etc. The police station then gave the shell casings obtained in the case to</p>
<p>precise examination</p>
<p>and determined that the weapons used in the four shooting incidents that occurred successively on Kainar Road, Robertsen Road, and Jessfield Road were all the same as the murder weapon used to kill Zhu, etc. However, Li Pinquan repeatedly denied it after repeated questioning by the police station, and stated that his son was only eighteen years old and still in school. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo ordered Li and Wu to be brought to court for continued trial. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the reason for the previous request for postponement was to investigate the other case committed by Li, and now it has been found that he shot and killed</p>
<p>Zhu and Chen</p>
<p>and injured Lu Xiaoquan. However, the police station does not intend to proceed with the case at this time, so today it will only try the two defendants for the assault on the police officer. The violence that the defendants inflicted on the police officer at that time, if no other police officers had heard the alarm and rushed to help, then the police officer would have been forcibly dragged into the alley, causing a terrible aftermath. Li provided all the cars to the Guangsheng Company gambling den as a means of picking up and dropping off gamblers, and Wu was in charge of</p>
<p>gambling den bodyguards</p>
<p>It is difficult to allow them to evade responsibility and they should be severely punished together. The court immediately conducted a thorough investigation of Li and Wu regarding the alleged assault on the police officer, and their defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang made their final arguments. Judge Dai then announced that the verdict would be announced on the morning of the 17th of this month, and Li and the other two were ordered to be returned to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>A Huge Amount of Opium Hidden in "Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos" Medicine Packages Sent from Yunnan Was Seized After Being Opened and Sold in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Police officer No. 278 of the Shanghai Municipal Police Force's Search Team, and Chinese police officers No. 85 and No. 965, searched pedestrians and vehicles with suspicious movements on Weihaiwei Road near Tongfu Road at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 12th). At that time, a No. 18269 silver motor car, driven by driver Huan Chang, arrived at the scene and was stopped for a search. The passengers in the car were four men and one girl.</p>
<p>Fifty packets of opium</p>
<p>were found in the car, each weighing about two taels. The passengers and opium were taken to the police station for investigation. Interrogated, they were named Li Chonggao (30 years old, from Hubei, living on the third floor of No. 9, Lane 455, Hankou Road), Wang Zhengqing (26 years old, living at No. 13, Jingqinfang, Guangdong Road), Luo Yisu (31 years old, from Wuxi), Hu Wenda (26 years old, from Shanghai), and the girl was named Er Nv (10 years old), the daughter of Luo Yisu. She was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. According to Li's confession, another 120 packets of opium were found at his residence, as well as large packets of medicinal materials.</p>
<p>Nineteen pieces of mail</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Chonggao was prosecuted for the crime of selling opium under Article 5 of the Anti-Opium Regulations, and the other three defendants were prosecuted for the crime of helping to sell opium. Judge Xiao Peishen ascended the seat to interrogate. Defendant Li Chonggao confessed that he originally did not do this business, because his friend Chen Zili wrote a letter to him from Yunnan, saying that a large batch of opium was hidden in</p>
<p>Chinese medicine Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos</p>
<p>packed and sent to me to sell on consignment. A few days after receiving the letter, the goods also arrived in Shanghai. On the 9th of this month, I went to the post office and transported all nineteen packages he sent to my home. He wrote in the letter that there was no opium in the odd-numbered mail numbers. The opium was hidden in the even-numbered packages. When I opened the medicine packages, at first I couldn't see anything myself. I then crushed the Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos and discovered his hiding method: the opium was wrapped in paper, then</p>
<p>sealed with lead</p>
<p>and then wrapped tightly with burlap. Finally, the outer skin of the Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos was crushed and glued piece by piece onto the burlap with glue. People who are not careful cannot see it, but it is slightly heavier than real Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos. I first unpacked fifty small packets and asked Wang Chengqing to sell them for me. He then introduced Hu and the other two, saying that Lin Menglang, No. 2, Zhongmai Village, Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, wanted to buy them at a high price. Yesterday, I hired a car to bring the first fifty packets as a sample to</p>
<p>discuss the price with them</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were caught by the police station in Tongfu Road, etc. At the court, Wang Chengqing was interrogated accordingly, and confessed that he only introduced Li and did not receive any remuneration. The two defendants, Luo and Hu, firmly denied any involvement in helping to sell. The court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the trial to next Friday. The 159 packets of opium that had been unpacked were first stored in the treasury.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Gambling Den Receives Three Bomb Threats</h3>
<p>And Warns Rongsheng Company to Close Down in Three Days, Otherwise They Will Kill Their People and Bomb Their Den</p>
<p>The Hollywood gambling den is the number one in western Shanghai. It has earned two million yuan in three months. Rongsheng Company is second, earning one million in half a year. It has six cars. However, the guerrillas have been very active recently. Hollywood has received three bombs and warning letters. A Pai Gow incident occurred a few days ago. There were four people in total. A burly man bet 600 yuan on the Pai Gow table, but the table had a 500 yuan limit and still reported to the cashier's office. Unexpectedly, the cashier's office was black-hearted and ordered the game to be opened, and ate up the 600 yuan. The burly man then picked up the teapot and smashed the head of the person pushing the Pai Gow. A group of bodyguards threatened with handguns. The burly man and the three people who came with him each pulled out new-style twenty-shot Mauser pistols and fired randomly. People in the gambling den were terrified and kowtowed to apologize, paid back 600 yuan, and sent 1,000 yuan, and promised to send 10 yuan every day. The burly man smiled and took the money and left with the people he came with in a car. Rongsheng Company, within these three days, received three consecutive warning letters from the Anti-Traitors Group, ordering them to close down within the last three days, otherwise they would kill their people and bomb their den. Dasheng Company also received this warning letter, so the gambling den owners did not dare to go to western Shanghai, etc.</p>
<h3>The Dark Side of Society: Two Young Girls Commit Suicide in an Inn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two modern girls committed suicide in a room at the Zhongnan Hotel on Edward Road. According to the investigation, one woman went to the hotel earlier that evening and rented room 224, paying the tea server six yuan for the room. She wrote Wang Yuejuan, 18 years old, from Jiangsu, in the guest book. The tea server did not suspect anything and turned around and left. After a while, another girl of similar age came and entered the room to meet her. At that time, there was also nothing suspicious found. They went to sleep until late at night, lying together in one bed. Until about 9:30 yesterday morning, the waiter suddenly heard groaning sounds in the room. He called out but there was no response. Knowing that something had happened, he quickly reported to the police station and called an ambulance to send them to Renji Hospital. At the same time, a letter to a classmate on Matt Hess Road was left on the bedside, and the words were farewell, so it was determined that they had committed suicide by taking poison. The letter was then taken by the police station for investigation. It was heard that the end of the letter was signed Zhu Xiuzhen. Obviously, Wang Yuejuan was an alias. After the two were taken to the hospital for treatment by car, their condition was very dangerous due to the time elapsed. As of last night, the two were still unconscious and their lives were in danger. As for what stimulation caused them to commit suicide and where their addresses were, the police station is investigating from the classmate to whom the letter was addressed.</p>
<p>Bashing Head Against Wall</p>
<p>At the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Arabus Road in the northern district of the Public Concession, in a small alley in Heji Lane, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, a man of about forty years old repeatedly bashed his head against the wall until he fainted from the pain and rolled around on the ground. After waking up, he continued to bash his head as before. After being asked why he was doing this, he replied that he was from Hang County, Zhejiang. His parents, wife, children, and other eight family members were all burned and killed by the Japanese soldiers. Only he escaped and came to Shanghai to look for relatives and friends but could not find them. All the clothes, etc., he brought with him had been pawned. Having no choice, he did this. It is better to smash himself to death than to starve to death. Then someone gave him a bowl of white rice and a few corner tickets, ordering him to go to a refugee camp to be cared for.</p>
<p>Falling and Injuring</p>
<p>Chen Shanying, a 19-year-old girl from Ningbo, lived at a certain number on Xinza Road. She was a female worker in the egg product refrigeration department of the Warehouse Trust Company at No. 1080, East Broadway Road. Yesterday at about 1:00 PM, she took the company's shuttle truck to Hongkou to work. When she arrived at the place and had not yet stopped, Chen Shanying wanted to get out of the car first, so she jumped off the car, causing her to fall on the stone on the sidewalk. At that time, her head was broken and her face was covered in blood. She was quickly taken to Hu's Hospital for treatment by car. It was heard that her skull was broken and blood was flowing from her ears, nose, and mouth, and her life was in danger.</p>
<p>Throwing Oneself into the River</p>
<p>Xu Denan, a 27-year-old man from Pudong, was suffering from unemployment and economic difficulties, so he had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. At about 8:20 yesterday morning, he went straight to Pier No. 1 on the Bund and jumped into the Huangpu River while people were unprepared, attempting to commit suicide. He was rescued and taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.</p>
<p>Run Over</p>
<p>A young girl surnamed Yang, named Duohuan, only five years old, lived at No. 51, Ciann North Lane, Annam Road. Yesterday, at around 3:30 PM, Huanlian was playing with two neighboring children next to the traffic light pole at Foch Road and Hart Road. Suddenly, a No. 788 black-plated car drove up quickly. Yang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down and ran over, breaking her right leg and causing her to faint. Later, the police officer on duty rushed to the scene to record the car number and carried the injured child to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Bosses in Panic, Taking Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>Due to repeated intrusions and shootings at various gambling tables along roads beyond the boundaries of the French Concession in western Shanghai, gambling den bosses and "bao tai jiao" (thugs) are in a state of panic. In addition to increasing the number of puppet police for protection, they have installed iron gates in the entrances of gambling rooms and alleys. Secret rooms have also been created, and important figures are living in seclusion, taking strict precautions. Furthermore, bosses of the Hua Hui lottery headquarters, such as Mao Axiang and Li Xiaotao, fearing attacks by patriotic elements, have not dared to go to the headquarters for days and are said to be hiding in secret locations.</p>
<h3>Child Concealing Weapon Arrested and Confiscated</h3>
<p>Confession reveals the weapon was entrusted by bandit leader "Little Drill," with the fugitive bandit leader and two accomplices temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Chinese and foreign detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station, at 6:15 PM the day before yesterday, near the intersection of Gordon Road and Haifang Road, noticed two Jiangbei children, Liang Xiaosanzi and his fellow villager Pang Jinchang, walking unsteadily and acting suspiciously. They were stopped, and a Mauser pistol with seventeen bullets, an automatic pistol without bullets, and eight pawn tickets were found on Liang's person. Upon questioning, it was learned that they lived at No. 24 Changchun Lane, Bailinan Road, and the guns and bullets were given to them by a man named "Little Drill," who asked them to deliver them to a certain alley entrance on Haifang Road. The detectives went to the alley to make an arrest but found he had already fled. They then escorted Liang Xiaosanzi and Pang Jinchang to No. 24 Changchun Lane, Bailinan Road, where they apprehended two women, Lu Li-shi and Wu Liu-shi, and confiscated two flashlights. "Little Drill" had still not returned. However, because the location was in a lost territory, the two women were temporarily detained by the puppet "Great Way Municipal Government" and refused to be handed over. The detectives had no choice but to take Liang and Pang, along with the guns and bullets, to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the two defendants had told the police that the fugitive "Little Drill" was the leader of a bandit gang that, in February of this year, had committed armed robbery in the Old Gate area, with one accomplice, Yang Siqing, already arrested. (It was found that Yang committed fraud in the Public Concession, swindling money from ladies' social clubs and committing robbery). The First Court will announce the verdict today. He requested an extension for further investigation. The guns and bullets were presented for inspection. Liang Xiaosanzi confessed that he had carried the pistol for "Little Drill" three times. Pang Jinchang's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them remanded in custody for further investigation in seven days.</p>
<h3>Renfeng Factory Lawsuit Settled Amicably</h3>
<p>Xu Tingyu, the factory director of the Renfeng Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city, previously engaged lawyers Zhang Fayao and E Sen to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District against Zhu Gengtao, the factory's manager, accusing him of conspiring with Zhang Zixin of the Xinchang Cotton Cloth Company to embezzle over 250,000 yuan. The case had been heard approximately twenty times by judges Wu Kechou and Qiu Huan-ying, but had not yet concluded. At the same time, the factory owner Xie Keming's case against Zhu Gengtao for embezzling tens of thousands of yuan had also been summoned several times by the court president. This case is currently being heard by Judge Qiu. For the convenience of the trial, Judge Qiu ascended the bench of the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM and consolidated the two cases for joint hearing. The defendant Zhu Gengtao, accompanied by his defense lawyers Ma Shouhua, Xue Duqi, and Jiang Yiping, and Zhang Zixin, accompanied by his defense lawyers Li Wenjie and Wang Heng, arrived on time to await the hearing. E Sen, the representing lawyer of the plaintiffs Xu Tingyu and Xie Keming, stated to the court that the accounts of the case had not yet been fully investigated and that after several adjustments there were hopes of a peaceful resolution, requesting the court to grant an extension to allow for further investigation of the accounts and negotiation of a settlement. The defendant's defense lawyers also expressed their agreement to the court. The court, upon considering the statements, approved the extension. Both parties went outside to negotiate a settlement on the civil aspects, and the court ordered that the criminal aspects be heard at a later date.</p>
<h3>Renting Land to Build Houses: Abnormal Development</h3>
<p>Since the southeastern provinces of Shanghai became war zones, people from various places have moved to the concessions to seek refuge, leading to a situation where the supply of housing in the two special districts cannot meet the demand. Generally, secondary landlords initially rented out rooms at high prices and then transferred the entire property at high interest rates. Renters who had nowhere to live had to rent at these prices to seek temporary peace. In order to adapt to the current environmental needs and passively resist the method of transferring houses at high prices, businesses engaged in real estate and property management have begun to build houses for customers. Tenants are also happy to invest in entrusting construction to reduce the burden of monthly rent. It is understood that the number of merchants who build houses for customers has increased several times compared to before the war. In addition to the existing real estate businesses, various banks, trust companies, accountants, and lawyers have also begun to engage in this business. The method of operation is mostly renting land to build houses, with terms of ten, fifteen, or twenty years. According to those familiar with the real estate situation, the value of building houses for customers in Shanghai is mostly between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan, with the highest price not exceeding 6,000 yuan, which is comparable to the general high transfer fee, so customers who entrust construction benefit a lot more than those who rent. Moreover, merchants who build houses usually return the original amount after the contract expires. Currently, there are more than sixty companies operating in the construction of houses in the two concessions, which can be said to be an abnormal development after the war.</p>
<h3>Manager of the Java Company, Pan Tanghua, Going Abroad for Inspection</h3>

More than one hundred factory owners and representatives attended. Zhang Wenkui, representing the Hengyisheng Factory, was elected to deliver a farewell speech. He said that the factories at sea appreciate Mr. Pan and the overseas Chinese inspection team for not hesitating to travel to overseas markets to promote and introduce national goods, sparing no effort, recovering a lot of foreign exchange, making outstanding contributions to people's livelihoods, and increasing national strength. At the same time, he hoped that the factories would maintain a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and strive to improve, for example, the products and prices must be standardized, and public associations should be established to send samples, etc. On the other hand, he also hoped that Mr. Pan would inform them of the needs of the local situation at any time so that they could improve at any time to expand sales. Mr. Pan replied that the overseas Chinese compatriots' enthusiasm for loving the motherland is increasing day by day, and their understanding of national goods is also increasing day by day. There has been significant progress recently, so their interest in promoting national goods is also increasing. He deeply hoped that the manufacturers would cooperate, work together, and strive forward, which was quite encouraging to the factories. Then, Mr. Lin Hongxing of the overseas Chinese inspection team delivered a thank you speech, and then they took photos and dined before dispersing.</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion on the Prescription Business in Shanghai Pharmacies</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jingren</p>
<p>Patients who have good doctors are less likely to die in vain, but if there are good doctors without good medicines, the disease cannot be cured, and if there are good medicines but no formally trained and experienced musicians to prescribe them, they can also take people's lives in an instant. Therefore, no medicine, whether for internal or external use, can be handled by unlicensed pharmacists!</p>
<p>Shanghai is a special area of ​​my country. Before August 13, my country's health laws and regulations could reach the administrative authorities of the two concessions, and advertisements for all kinds of bizarre new drugs were filled in newspapers, and no agency cared about them.</p>
<p>The prescription business is one of the main businesses in a pharmacy, and in principle, a formal pharmacist should be hired to take charge of it, which is by no means something that anyone can do. However, looking around this city (the French Concession authorities have now stipulated that every pharmacy within the boundary should be operated by a pharmacist, otherwise it cannot be opened), I am afraid that only two or three out of ten have formal pharmacists in the prescription room. Even worse, newly opened, smaller-scale pharmacies not only have no pharmacists, but even pharmacy students are difficult to find. The cleanliness and management of the prescription room are also completely disordered. It is surprising that the authorities do not attach importance to the prescription business, which can determine people's lives and is related to the great problem of national health. Moreover, if there are errors in the prescribed drugs, patients have no way of knowing, and misleading patients can lead to people's lives in an instant. How can we not be extra cautious! Mistakes are extremely easy to make when dispensing medicines. In the past, a certain hospital made the big mistake of mistakenly dispensing Atropina as Atophan. I think there are countless examples of this kind. In addition, some pharmacy authorities now like to purchase cheap fake medicines for prescription purposes, such as diluting hydrochloric acid and pretending it is almond water, or using salicylic acid or acetic acid to pretend to be aspirin for sale, which is especially absurd, stealing and harming people. If patients mistakenly take this kind of fake medicine and their symptoms change or even become incurable, they do not suspect that they are harmed by fake medicine, and are determined that it is an error in the doctor's diagnosis. Therefore, the medicines used in the pharmacy's prescription room should be inspected by licensed pharmacists before they can be used if there is any doubt. Otherwise, the patients will suffer undeservedly.</p>
<p>The prescription business is the most profitable business in a pharmacy, and it should not be done sloppily. Merchants value profit, which has been said since ancient times, but the pharmaceutical industry is related to people's lives, so how can we forget righteousness when we see profit!</p>

<h3>Health Preservation During Measles</h3>
<p>— Su Zengxiang</p>
<p>— A Notice for Parents —</p>
<p>Measles, commonly known as "chushazi" (getting the rash) or "yuzi," has different names in different regions. After the rash appears, everyone can recognize it. People believe that this disease is unavoidable for children and is one of the most frightening infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Experience tells us that measles itself is not dangerous, but why is it considered so scary? Those who don't understand medicine say they fear whether it will "appear or not" or whether it will "appear completely." Those who understand medicine say they fear complications such as pneumonia, otitis media, bronchitis, true or false diphtheria, tuberculosis, swollen lymph nodes, etc. In reality, the so-called "appear or not" or "appear incompletely" is due to these complications. In Germany, the medical community often treats children with measles or measles with complications by having them wear hats, wrapping them in thick blankets, dressing them warmly, leaving only their faces exposed, and placing their beds in corridors or gardens. The results are very good. Therefore, their mortality rate is much lower than ours! Some people may think I am rambling, but this is what I have witnessed. Originally, as long as the body is warm, even if cold air enters the lungs through the nasal cavity, it will already have warmed up and will not cause harm. On the other hand, in most Chinese families, when a child gets measles, they tightly close the windows and doors, cover them with blankets, and even burn some fumigants in the stove, filling the room with smoke and foul air. In such a polluted atmosphere, if pneumonia does not develop, they still do not know the source of the problem and instead say that measles itself is dangerous. One patient's family told me that a few years ago, her child had measles. She held the child and sat in a mosquito net that was not ventilated, burning things under the bed, causing the child's eyes to roll upwards constantly. Later, after being advised, she stopped. Please tell me, isn't this treatment like climbing a tree to catch a fish? Know that after three or four days of fever, nasal discharge, and other inflammatory conditions, as long as the lungs and heart are well protected and there are no complications, the rash will naturally appear. Of course, we hope it appears quickly and subsides slowly, with a red face rather than a pale one. However, you must know that in a polluted atmosphere and in a state of physical weakness, measles can occur simultaneously with pneumonia (primary, not secondary). Once pneumonia develops, the flow of blood through the capillaries of the skin is blocked, and the rash will not appear, or even if it does, it will immediately disappear. At that time, it is what is commonly called "appear or not" and "appear incompletely." Therefore, what is most important is to understand the cause, understand the principles, and not blindly spread misinformation, which leads to the opposite result. In addition, people generally believe that when suffering from measles, one should seal the eyes, mouth, and nose, resulting in not even daring to wipe the face, which is also a cause of otitis media and pneumonia. I recall when I was young, I saw a relative who often squinted. People told me that this was a symptom she got after having measles. As for pus draining from the ears after having measles (a result of otitis media), everyone considers it common. Measles can also promote diseases such as tuberculosis, which is something ordinary people do not expect. In fact, everything can be prevented and avoided, and we don't have to make such unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, whether measles is terrible depends on one's ability to preserve health!</p>
<p>As for the saying that measles is an "unavoidable infectious disease for children," it is also not entirely accurate. I have a friend whose two children, one ten years old and one eleven years old, have never had measles because she takes strict precautions. This shows that measles can be avoided! Some people mistakenly believe the saying "unavoidable" and even think that having it early is a relief. This is completely wrong. The younger a child is, the weaker their resistance, and the more likely they are to develop complications. For example, a child whose lungs are originally weak may have their lung disease go from latent to progressive after measles. These are all medical common sense known to ordinary people.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down the eclectic, environment-friendly, and easily implemented methods of health preservation during measles, hoping that parents will pay attention: (1) Strive to keep the indoor air clean. Open a small window in a windless corner of the room. Keep the room temperature warm and moderate. Do not keep the patient suffocated under blankets. For smaller children, you can often change the position in which you carry them to allow all parts of the lungs to be active and prevent pneumonia. If you use a stove, place boiling water on it so that the steam rises and the indoor air does not become dry. Do not burn fumigants or smoke cigarettes. The fewer idlers, the better, in order to maintain clean indoor air. (2) Wash the patient's mouth with cotton dipped in sugar water or boric acid water daily. For older children, they should gargle often. Wash the nasal cavity with cotton swabs wrapped with cotton dipped in boric acid water. Wipe both eyes with cotton soaked in boric acid water. (3) Children with colds, coughs, pneumonia, and other symptoms are prone to complications of otitis media, so pay attention to whether the patient's ears are painful or have abnormalities. You can drip a drop of olive oil as soon as possible. If an infant grabs their ears or scratches their head with both hands, this indicates that the infant's ear may be painful, and it should be checked immediately. (4) Steam method: Use a long-necked lead kettle two or three feet long filled with boiling water and heat it on a water and wine stove or electric stove. When the steam comes out, move it to the child's bedside, as close to the mouth as possible. This method can prevent pneumonia and otitis media. (5) Bowel movements should not be loose, but there should be one bowel movement daily. (6) Do not make the room light too strong to avoid stimulating eyesight. (7) If the fever does not subside five or six days after the rash appears, or if the fever subsides and then rises again, then there must be complications. A detailed examination should be carried out to identify the source of the disease and treat it. (8) In terms of diet, light, soft, easily digestible, and nutritious things can be eaten. Greasy things are not suitable, but absolutely eating vegetarian food is also not advisable, as it easily puts the child in a weaker state.</p>
<p>Common Sense About Losing Sickness</p>
<h3>Diabetes and Polyuria (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>Diabetes is called "xiaoke bing" (wasting and thirsting disease) in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the written records are not detailed enough. Most traditional Chinese medicine practitioners consider someone with thirst and excessive urination to have "xiaoke bing." However, the symptom of thirst and excessive urination is a key symptom of diabetes, but it is not unique to diabetes, as polyuria also presents this symptom. Diabetes has its own causes and pathology, and polyuria has its own causes and pathology. The two cannot be confused as one. The logic is very clear, so it is necessary to question what "xiaoke bing" actually refers to. I will now explain the two diseases in detail below for readers to study, so as to avoid mistaken identity.</p>
<p>Causes of Diabetes</p>
<p>The cause of diabetes is due to pancreatic deficiency. The pancreas is one of the organs of the human body and has two different functions. One is to control digestion. Its digestive function still involves producing an enzyme that is introduced into the duodenum to mix with food and digest it. There are three types of enzymes: protein enzyme, fat enzyme, and starch enzyme, because food contains protein, fat, and starch.</p>
<p>After food passes through the stomach and intestines and mixes with enzymes, a fermentation effect occurs, transforming the substance of the food into a substance suitable for the human body, such as converting starch into glucose, which permeates into the blood to provide the body with applications.</p>
<p>After each meal, a nerve impulse occurs. When the pancreas receives this impulse, it secretes enzymes, which can be extracted from the pancreatic duct for various experiments. Physiologists call it exocrine.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pancreas produces another substance that controls the action of eliminating sugar, similar to an enzyme, produced by another type of cell tissue within the pancreas. These cells gather in groups, scattered within the pancreatic tissue, not connected to each other, shaped like islands in the ocean. It was first discovered by Langerhaus, so it is called the islets of Langerhaus. The cells of these islets construct a substance called insulin. Insulin is Latin for bird element. When bird element enters the blood, there is no channel for it to pass through. It permeates into the blood through osmosis and cannot be directly extracted from the outside for various experiments, so it is called endocrine.</p>
<p>If islet hormone is lacking or completely depleted, the sugar absorbed by the blood will not only be unable to be used by the body, but some of it will also turn into toxic substances such as organic acid ketones. These toxins circulate with the blood and often paralyze the nerves. If not treated early, mild cases will have nerve pain, and severe cases will develop coma. Part of it will be excreted in urine and stool, so when analyzing urine, sugar will appear.</p>
<p>Excessive eating can easily tire the pancreas. When the pancreas is tired, secretion will become unbalanced. When secretion is unbalanced, diabetes is difficult to avoid. In those who drink alcohol, because the bloodstream contains alcohol, the pancreas is overstimulated. Initially, it may produce too much bird element, leading to an increase in appetite. Meals are often more than normal - this is the so-called bird element abundance syndrome. After a long time, the pancreas becomes tired, and endocrine deficiency occurs, and diabetes gradually develops. Those suffering from syphilis have toxins in their blood that can either harden blood vessels or attack the pancreas, causing its secretion to become unbalanced. This is also a factor in the development of diabetes. Other infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, diphtheria, malaria, and splenic carbuncle also cause toxins to circulate in the blood, hindering the function of the pancreas, leading to increased blood sugar and sugar in the urine. This is another factor.</p>
<p>Pathology of Diabetes</p>
<p>Diabetes, as a disease, has been determined to be a disease of the pancreas through the research of Mr. Ming, Mr. Van Mei, Mr. Xiu, and Mr. Xia. Then, through the research of Mr. Ke, Mr. De, Mr. Du, Mr. Di, and Mr. Ban, it is known that it is caused by a lack of pancreatic endocrine, and an endocrine substance called islet hormone can be directly produced from the pancreas of warm-blooded animals. Mr. Qinghao, Mr. Mao, Mr. Bu, Mr. Dai, and Mr. Ma used lower-level animals to repeatedly experiment with islet hormone and found that its functions are threefold:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting the metabolism of starch.</p>
<p>(2) Increasing the function of converting glucose in the blood into starch that can be stored in the animal body.</p>
<p>(3) Enhancing the function of gasification.</p>
<p>Therefore, once the pancreas is deficient, endocrine will be obstructed, the above three functions will disappear, and diabetes will develop. Those who suffer from diabetes and die, when dissecting their pancreas, often find that the islets of Langerhans have disease characteristics. Therefore, diabetes can be further said to be a disease of the islets of Langerhans. The reason is self-evident.</p>
<h3>Medical Gleanings (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Sizhai</p>
<p>Fat Diarrhea</p>
<p>When pancreatic juice secretion is impaired, fat decomposition and absorption both become abnormal. Therefore, the patient's stool is greasy and shiny and contains a large amount of neutral fat. Microscopic examination shows numerous fat droplets and soaps. This is called fat diarrhea.</p>
<p>Physiological or Dietary Laxatives</p>
<p>For those with habitual constipation, nutritional therapy should be emphasized in treatment. Rice with wheat, wild vegetables, potatoes, beans, mushrooms, fruits such as peaches and plums, sugar, honey, and fats can all make intestinal peristalsis more active, so they are suitable for use. The above items are called physiological or dietary laxatives.</p>
<p>Liver Consumption</p>
<p>The term "liver consumption" does not refer to tuberculosis of the liver. During the course of liver abscesses, there is often fever, consumption, and weakness, often with chills and night sweats. The symptoms are very similar to pulmonary tuberculosis, hence the name "liver consumption."</p>

<h3>Praising the Teachers and Students of the Sicun School</h3>
<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" incident, we knew that many students from Fudan University and Jinan University rushed to the front lines to participate in the war of resistance. After "August 13th," similar students could be seen everywhere. They disregarded everything and participated in direct actions to save the country. We praise them.</p>
<p>A professor at a certain university in Beiping led a group of students and workers to the western suburbs to carry out guerrilla warfare after Beiping fell. We praise this patriotic teacher.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sihang Warehouse defenders were unyielding and vowed to use their last drop of blood to preserve the last piece of national territory until the supreme commander ordered a retreat before the entire division crossed the Suzhou River. We also praise their bravery.</p>
<p>Now, when we see the "loyalty, bravery, and martyrdom" of the teachers and students of the Jinnan Sicun School, our praise cannot but be consistently poured onto these teachers and students.</p>
<p>Speaking of the students, "most are underage youths." Their entire participation in a "do-or-die battle" with the enemy is even more commendable than the students from Fudan and other schools. Speaking of the teachers, each one is like a certain professor in Beiping. Having good teachers gathered in one school is also rare. Moreover, their entire body of teachers and students "often disarmed enemies with their bare hands," and "their equipment was too poor and unfavorable, so the casualties were quite heavy," making it even more difficult than the Sihang Warehouse defenders. Even if they became the isolated army of Yao Ziqing and the army was annihilated, we would naturally offer incense and prayers for them, and venerate them for thousands of years. The fact that they were actually able to "break through completely," "killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and destroying five Japanese military vehicles," and "their deeds are enough to make ghosts and gods weep and scare the Japanese army," how can we not prostrate ourselves and sincerely praise them as the "model for teachers and students of schools across the country"!</p>
<p>In their case, they only intended to kill the enemy and serve the country loyally and did not hope for our praise or the government's "preferential compensation," but their praise and compensation are what they deserve. Moreover, I believe that their "generous and courageous spirit" will eventually last for thousands of years!</p>
<p>Looking back at the teachers and students in Shanghai schools now, what are they doing? Among them, there are naturally outstanding individuals who have done things to save the country that are worthy of praise. However, we often hear of principals who "do not allow patriotic organizations," Chinese language teachers who advocate "rather be a dog in peace than a person in chaos," and young students who "do not forget to dance while saving the country." For these things, we really want to cry but have no tears and don't know where to start weeping!</p>
<p>We don't know what the "four cuns" originally meant. But we can say, "To preserve righteousness for heaven and earth, to preserve aspirations for the nation, to preserve vitality for the country, to preserve integrity for the scholar community," they are worthy of this "four cuns" without shame!</p>
<h3>Sawing the Bridge</h3>
<p>— Zou Yaosheng</p>
<p>Xiao Ming ran from afar, his head steaming with heat, panting as he winked at Ah Yuan, who was chatting with Sixty Old Daddy, looking both nervous and panicked. Sixty and Ah Yuan couldn't help but be stunned in their leisurely mood.</p>
<p>"Young people are really not calm. Is there any news? Speak, there are only the two of us here." Sixty said, his face so peaceful, with wrinkles around his eyes and on his forehead, marking his age.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang reported that the Third Squad will leave the town tomorrow, with one large truck and one small covered truck, already filled with fuel! They will pass through ×× Road to × Town around 7 o'clock at dawn."</p>
<p>"Is that certain?" Ah Yuan asked excitedly.</p>
<p>"Of course, Old Zhang said it so truthfully and even told me not to miss this opportunity."</p>
<p>"One squad...one large truck, one small truck...×× Road...seven o'clock..." Sixty muttered these words to himself, as if in deep thought.</p>
<p>As night fell, the backs of these three passionate comrades disappeared into the evening mist.</p>
<p>A crescent moon hung on the distant treetops. A narrow, gravelly ancient road stretched windingly from the far east to the northwest. In the middle of the road was a dead river. Judging from the ripples on the water surface illuminated by the moonlight, it did not seem like the usual murky stagnant water; it was so clear and beautiful; it was quite deep. A wooden bridge was built over it, supported by four pine trunks. Below, there was a rustling sound, breaking the silence of the night. Suddenly, the two ends of the pine trunks were completely broken, and deep cracks appeared at both ends of the wooden boards, but they had not yet collapsed.</p>
<p>"Xiao Ming, the work is almost done. Tell everyone to go to sleep. Remember! Five o'clock before dawn; also, don't forget to bring the gear!" Someone was ordering someone. An old man was lying in the reeds by the river, gazing dreamily at the crescent moon, with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth. Faint wisps of smoke seeped through the reed flowers, still so leisurely and peaceful.</p>
<p>"Ah Yuan, we have only this way to deal with a squad with twenty some people... Tell them in the reeds, aim with the gear, if the large truck is in front, take out the running rabbits, no need to say. If the small truck is in front, then things will be tricky!... Ah; might as well go all the way, and just let my old life be!" A layer of determined frost smeared the old man's face.</p>
<p>"Yes, Old Daddy." The person there watched silently, gripping their hands tightly like iron.</p>
<p>Fish-belly white light shone from the east in the distance, and a thin white frost had already flashed faintly over the earth, concealing all the filth and imperfections.</p>
<p>After a flurry of activity in the reeds and grass piles by the river, it gradually became quiet again. Sixty Old Daddy wiped his nose spiritedly, put his arm around Ah Yuan's shoulder:</p>
<p>"Brother, we are confident today. Aren't you hearing the magpies congratulating us? Haha..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a continuous sound came from afar, getting louder and louder. The outline of a grayish-yellow truck slowly became clear. The emotions here were tense, and the eyes filled with sparks were wide open.</p>
<p>"Comrades, calm down! Success is guaranteed today, the large truck is in front!" Although this group of people had considerable experience in warfare, Ah Yuan, because of his leadership position, was concerned that everyone would not be able to restrain their emotions, so he gave this instruction.</p>
<p>The truck had reached the foot of the bridge, the heads of the full truckload of Japanese devils ducking as they trembled, fearfully aiming their guns at the surrounding fields. The truck rumbled onto the bridge deck.</p>
<p>"Whoosh—! Boom—!"</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!" Sparks came from the reeds, and a reddish tinge rippled through the clear river water.</p>
<p>The small truck stopped with a "screech," quickly set up a machine gun, and the muzzle roared aimlessly.</p>
<p>"Young men, charge! The Japanese officer on that small truck." Sixty was the first to dart out of the grass pile, but he fell straight down. The crowd behind him covered over like a tide.</p>
<p>"Bang, bang, bang, bang...Gugugu..." In response to the sound of rifles, one by one the Japanese devils fell, but the machine gun bullets continued to ravage the grass piles and dirt on the riverbank.</p>
<p>Now, there was silence. Ah Yuan ran to the side of Sixty Old Daddy and saw him lying quietly there; his shattered guts mixed with the dirt on the ground; yet he opened his mouth wide, as if silently calling out. Ah Yuan knelt down with a thud, tears hanging from the corners of his eyes; "Old Daddy, you are the father of China, rest peacefully. The children will grow up from blood!"</p>
<h3>Strange Bedfellows</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<h3>Luck, Complacency, Peace</h3>
<p>— Chen Ren</p>
<p>Putting decades of hard-won effort at stake in a gamble of luck is undoubtedly a suicidal policy. In the face of a powerful enemy, failing to rise up in resistance and only seeking temporary complacency is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death.</p>
<p>Luck and complacency are both undesirable. However, the world is full of people who seek luck, and the only hope of the lucky rests on the complacent.</p>
<p>However, the world is full of elements seeking complacency, and the only hope of the complacent is peace.</p>
<p>The foundation of peace is not built on complacency. All peace-loving people in the world should seek survival in struggle, and strike a head-on blow to those who seek luck at any time. If one seeks compromise through concessions, seeks complacency through compromise, and seeks peace through complacency, that is simply courting death.</p>
<p>The lucky ones opened their bloody mouths and swallowed Guangzhou, Hainan Island, and South China piece by piece; but the complacent ones are still dreaming of peace. But where is peace? The answer is a chorus of bombs and gunfire, and the blood and flesh of tens of millions of innocent people flying horizontally.</p>
<p>When peace is hopeless and the psychology of the complacent loses its basis, the hopes of the lucky are bound to fail. Only when the last gamble is thrown down can the dawn of true peace reappear in the world.</p>
<h3>On "Her Mother's" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>Investigating the background of the emergence of "Her Mother's," it turns out there are several such social situations. I cannot cover them all here. I hope those with ambition will keep a close eye on her in this vast land of China:</p>
<p>When oppression becomes unbearable, when "eating the wall" until it collapses, when bullying strips one of their humanity, "Her Mother's" becomes action! Action arrives! "Raising the banner," naturally, the call is "Her Mother's"! "All under heaven gather in response," responding because there is a "Her Mother's" over there too. "Bringing provisions and following like shadows," following the call of "Her Mother's"! Going to hell to build paradise! Resolutely building it!</p>
<p>A roar! I cannot finish writing about all the scenes of roaring. I only know that from the roar of "Her Mother's" comes the starting point of a turned-over China, a brilliant and promising future. In this crucible, a new mechanism has been forged. Believe it or not, facts prove it.</p>
<p>I cannot write superficial articles, nor can I fail to raise my arm and shout "Her Mother's" with the times of "Her Mother's." As for the spirit that enables the success of "Her Mother's," one cannot help but use existing examples as annotations:</p>
<p>From the front lines: "Her Mother's! Take them down!"</p>
<p>In some corners, they are shouting: "Her Mother's! Clean them out! Let the reckoning begin!"</p>
<p>From the rear: "Causing families to be ruined! Her Mother's! I might as well throw away my old life! Charge forward!"</p>
<p>Some are still saying this: "So it's this kind of trick! The Way of Kings, the Way of Her Mother's! It's either me or you!"</p>
<p>The passionate spirit is even more so: "Risk it all! Go all in! Her Mother's!"</p>
<p>This orderly, resounding, proactive, magnificent, strong, beautiful, and reasonable voice has carved a deep and wide chasm in the national character, and has also abandoned all that has come before after this cry of "Her Mother's," leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Look! Wherever "Her Mother's" goes, stones and metal are opened!</p>
<p>This spirit, this epoch-making, decisive, and straightforward spirit, should be praised! We wish "Her Mother's" a bright future! And we hope it will be brought into full play! To turn a new page in Chinese history!</p>
<p>Humanity seeks survival, the nation seeks rebirth, and you have already inspired half of the great achievements! I believe victory in the War of Resistance is in sight. However, seeking perfection, I cannot help but offer a sincere wish: when building the nation, we must also maintain this proactive new spirit.</p>
<p>If the institutions are not right, if they are not a prerequisite for national interests, if they are not necessary materials for building the nation, then we must honestly and unceremoniously "show great ambition"—"Her Mother's," throw them out! Throw everything out and bring in what is reasonable!</p>
<p>Is this saying a new cornerstone in the period of transformation of the Chinese national character?</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Ten: The Fall of Hepu Town</p>
<p>Despite Commander Ye's repeated instructions to the soldiers, calling on them to remain calm and not to be afraid when encountering the enemy, it seemed that because the event was so sudden, many soldiers, just like the civilians, had only just emerged from the joyful New Year and were now facing the god of war. Their hearts could not settle down no matter what. In addition, enemy planes were constantly bombing the town, and the cries and shouts of the civilians were endless. All of this affected the morale of the front lines, causing their fighting spirit to diminish invisibly.</p>
<p>However, the biggest fatal flaw was the lack of heavy artillery in the troops. The enemy's attack, however, seemed to be planned, using the occupied transportation lines to bring all kinds of heavy weapons to attack Hepu Town. Battalion Commander Zhao Desheng led his troops to block the enemy at Qilidun. After two hours of fierce fighting, although reinforcements arrived in a steady stream, they had to retreat due to the enemy's overwhelming firepower, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice.</p>
<p>As soon as the Qilidun defense line retreated, the enemy's vanguard approached Hepu Town from the southeast. Soldiers ambushed in the woods began to shoot at the enemy, and many fell in response. This was originally a good piece of protective terrain, but under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, it became a clear target. Hundreds of pounds of shrapnel fell directly into the woods, uprooting the trees. Commander Ye had no choice but to order the troops to retreat across the river, and he personally used a grenade launcher to destroy the only small stone bridge on the river.</p>
<p>Thus began a thrilling street battle. Under the complex symphony of bombs, artillery, light and heavy machine guns, and rifles, amidst the smoke and fire, every warrior gritted their teeth, calmly hiding in the civilian homes, behind the trees, on the rooftops along the river, aiming and shooting at the enemy. Because the river was not wide, the enemy repeatedly attempted to swim across, but was swept back by our army's machine guns. Finally, their heavy weapons caught up, and they used the woods as cover to bombard the other side of the river. In the "boom boom" of the heavy artillery, the civilian houses along the river were broken and collapsed, and the warriors ambushed inside made heroic sacrifices. Commander Ye, seeing this situation, knew that it was impossible to hold out any longer, and had to order a tearful retreat, temporarily allowing his hometown to be ravaged by wolves and tigers.</p>
<p>After the retreat order was issued, the soldiers fired their guns at the opposite bank while slowly retreating north. However, there were also a few soldiers who, having received the order, continued to shoot, preferring to die rather than retreat. In this way, they held out against the enemy for another hour, until the sun was about to set, when the enemy and Lone-Eye Li's bandit troops completed their so-called "mopping-up" operation.</p>
<p>Although Commander Ye had ordered Liang Tuanfu to notify the civilians to evacuate as soon as the enemy planes began bombing, because the event was sudden and unexpected, and it was still the New Year, no one was prepared. Therefore, the number of people who escaped was less than a third of the town's population. (32)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Female Police Active on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Dong Tian</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows about the female police officers who served at the North and South Railway Stations in Shanghai, as well as in the western part of Shanghai and at the 16th pier. Wearing black Zhongshan suits on their upper bodies, black skirts, leggings, and leather shoes, they walked on the road as bravely as our male police officers.</p>
<p>There were more than thirty of them, all with strong physiques. As for their education, some were even attending institutions of higher learning. At that time, at the training institute on Dapu Road, they underwent three lectures and two exercises every day. After six months, they were all assigned to various sub-bureaus to practice social service. I often met them at the North Railway Station. At that time, none of them were not working diligently. As for them being commended by the bureau chief for finding large quantities of opium or confiscating several pistols, that was even more common. During the "August 13th" Incident, they were still calmly serving in Nanshi, and even shot and killed a traitor in front of Director Wen's memorial碑!</p>
<p>Don't underestimate them; their courage is no less than that of men. I remember last spring, more than a dozen of them wanted to go to Guangdong. After only one collective discussion, they bravely set off. When they arrived in Shunde County, Guangdong, they temporarily lived in Daliang Village. Before long, each of them had found something to do. Several were promoted to female instructors in the militia cadres, while the rest were either engaged in propaganda or fundraising. Their work achievements were amazing. Some parents wrote letters asking them to return to the group, but they all refused in their replies. They even said, "...Where is the home when the country is broken...? Saving the country requires spirit. How can we let men bear the responsibility alone?" These words truly put to shame many men who are greedy for life and afraid of death! As for their recent situation, one of them wrote in a letter: "There are more than a dozen of us, although our work is different and we have moved to many places, we always live together and always follow the front lines of the national army. Although we live in a bloody and stormy environment, we do not have the slightest fear." They are still in the counter-attacking troops, waiting for the opportunity to fight the enemy!</p>
<h3>Martyrdom</h3>
<p>— Ge Er</p>
<p>According to reports, a heroic and moving act of martyrdom recently occurred in Chengdu. The facts are as follows: On February 5th of this year, Air Force XX Squadron Leader Liu Fuhong, a valiant warrior, was ordered to lead several aircraft to Yuncheng, Shanxi, to bomb the Japanese airfield. After dropping more than a hundred bombs and destroying more than forty Japanese aircraft, he was preparing to return to his base when, unexpectedly, upon reaching Lintong, due to adverse weather conditions and heavy fog, he lost his way and was forced to land, suffering serious injuries and dying. When this unfortunate news reached the ears of Liu's newlywed wife, Ms. Chen Yingfan, she first attempted suicide by taking poison. Fortunately, she was discovered and saved in the hospital. However, Ms. Chen's love for her husband was extremely deep, and her intention to die for love had not been dispelled. Therefore, taking advantage of a moment when people were not paying attention, she secretly took a pistol and killed herself, wounding herself in a vital spot, and ultimately fulfilling her intention to die for love. Ms. Chen's profound love for her husband, which was described by the newspaper as a heroic act of martyrdom, is truly moving.</p>
<p>However, although we deeply mourn Ms. Chen's "martyrdom," we really cannot agree with her doing so.</p>
<p>"Martyrdom" was originally the so-called "virtue of women" in our feudal era. It was actually a cruel "torture" imposed by a male-centered society on the weak female masses. When a woman married a man, she lost everything. Not only her physical body, but even her soul and spirit, no longer belonged to her. In ancient times, if the emperors of some Eastern nations died, then their empresses and concubines had to die for them. Therefore, after thousands of years, when our geologists excavate the earth's crust, they can still unintentionally find "mummies" in "sealed tombs." This can be said to be the most typical example. Other examples, such as "chastity arches," are everywhere as long as we return to the countryside. When some of our pseudo-moralists shake their heads and praise the "chastity arches," they are actually spitting out blood from the corners of their mouths.</p>
<p>However, this feudal and barbaric "torture" of women by men has struck an unbreakable foundation in the minds of women, who regard it as a "virtue" and sadly sacrifice themselves, allowing some pseudo-moralists to spit out blood while shaking their heads in praise. This is a misfortune and a tragedy for the Chinese female masses! In this great crucible of resisting the war and building the nation, we must deal with this "torture" as we deal with the enemy, and clear the minds of the female masses of this poisonous consciousness that harms themselves and deprives them of their humanity!</p>
<p>Now is the era for women to have their own independence and humanity. They are also members of society and the nation. Therefore, they also have their due obligations and rights to society and the nation. "Martyrdom" is not a "virtue" of a modern woman, but rather, it is an "evil virtue" of a modern woman!</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Yingfan should not have died for her husband, Liu Fuhong. Since Warrior Liu had already sacrificed himself for the country, then Ms. Chen should have even more so raised the spirit of struggle a hundred or a thousand times for the sake of national and personal grievances, and demanded her blood debt from our national enemy!</p>
<p>However, Chen Yingfan ultimately died for love. This is not her fault. This is the remnant of the old era that killed her. Ms. Chen's "martyrdom" has once again exposed one of the "evil deeds" of the old era. Our war of resistance, together with the enemy, will sweep away the remnants of the old era! Chinese women! Arise!</p>

<p>Eighth Scene</p>
<p>(Dan rushes on, falls, sings) Suddenly, I hear the drums of war, the army pressing on the border. In this situation, it is hard for me to bear! I don't know what has become of Chancellor Fan. I have no choice but to throw myself into the well and end this miserable life! (Speaks) Alas, the army has arrived. Rather than be captured, bringing shame to my ancestors and earning the reputation of betraying the country, I might as well die by throwing myself into the well! But I don't know where Lang is, nor have I heard the news of a great victory over the Jin soldiers. I will die with my eyes open! Alas! It's too late to say anything now! (Acts as if to throw herself into the well, Sheng rushes on and pulls her back) Young lady, why are you taking your own life? (Dan) Don't meddle in my business, let me die! (Sheng) There is no reason for this, how can I stand by and watch you die? (Dan looks back) Ah! (Sheng releases her) Ah! (Dan) You, you, you... (Sheng) You, you, you... (Dan) Father! (Sheng) My child! (Dan) Father! (Kneels) (Sheng) My child! (Cries in longing) I thought we would never meet in this life, who knew we would meet again here. (Helps her up, they cry together) How did you get here, my child? (Dan) Father, please listen! (Sings) Since that day, I was captured by the enemy soldiers, I met Fan Xizhou, he was also in the enemy camp. (Sheng) What kind of person is that Luo Xizhou? (Dan sings) Fan Xizhou, he is also a scholar; he has no choice but to endure, temporarily staying in the enemy camp. (Sheng) What are his grievances? (Dan sings) He wants to persuade King Fan to wash his hands and surrender; who knew, all his good intentions were wasted. (Sheng) He should have abandoned darkness and turned to the light! (Dan) Exactly. (Sings quickly) Hearing that the Han army was approaching the border, he led his confidants out of the city. He was determined to go to the military camp to turn to the light and fight the Jin soldiers. (Sheng) Good, a good man! How do you know this so clearly? (Dan looks down, slightly embarrassed) I saw that he was no ordinary person, and I couldn't help but develop affection for him. He wanted to marry me, and I secretly agreed. (Kneels) Please forgive me for not informing you. (Sheng) Hmm! Trapped in the enemy's camp, there is nothing to be said! Since Chancellor Fan is a young and handsome man, and willing to work for the country, my child has chosen a hero with great vision. If your father were to choose a son-in-law, it would be no different! It's a pity I haven't met him yet, and I don't know if he is safe or not. This is killing me! (Dan) Why is Father here? (Sheng) Because I used to be the tax supervisor in Fuzhou, and I am familiar with the customs and traditions of Fujian, so General Han specially recruited me. As the military saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle. Whenever there are any difficulties in marching, they all ask me. Just now, General Han ordered me to search for the remnants of the Fan clan here, but unexpectedly I saved my child's life. Child, come with me, hahahahaha! (Both exit)</p>
<p>Ninth Scene</p>
<p>(Chou enters) Oh no, something terrible has happened! I am a tailor. Jin Wushu and Liu Yu have joined forces and led five thousand cavalry to capture Luzhou. I must use the Thirty-Six Stratagems and flee! (Flees, a Jin soldier with a knife enters) There is an enemy there, I will kill him! (Chou) Wait, wait, old friend! (Points to his own nose) I am not the enemy, I am a civilian! (Jin soldier) A civilian is good too. Treating civilians as enemies is our specialty. Come, come, take my knife! (Chou) I can give you my head, but I have a brother who won't allow it. (Jin soldier) Who is your brother? Tell him to come and meet me. (Chou) My brother (Quickly pulls out a ruler from his clothes and waves it, then puts it behind his back) Look, it's the thing you're holding in your hand. (Pulls out the ruler again and quickly slashes) Watch the knife! (Jin soldier backs away) I didn't see that coming, you have some skills. A hero doesn't suffer immediate losses. I will go forward and apologize, this is our old trick. (To Chou) I was blind and mistook you for an enemy soldier. I apologize to you! (Raises his hand and performs a foreign bow) (Chou) Hmph, hmph! (Jin soldier points to his mouth) Look, what is that? (Chou turns his head) (Jin soldier) Slip away! (Runs into the exit) (Chou) Haha, he ran away! Bullying the weak and fearing the strong, what a coward; timid as a mouse, using a ruler as a knife. (Takes out the ruler) He doesn't know that this is a ruler for measuring clothes! Little devil, little devil, I have already experienced your courage! Hahaha...! I must hurry on my way! (Exits)</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Turning into an Ape-Man"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>Produced by Xinhua, Distributed by China United, Premiering at Jincheng</p>
<p>Losing love and losing a job are the two major problems that generally plague young people. Bai Jianping in "Turning into an Ape-Man" was oppressed by powerful people, lost his job, and lost his love. Like countless young people, he was tormented by these two major problems. But Mrs. Hu saw this opportunity and, relying on her beauty and money, wanted to seize the pure soul of this young man. Bai Jianping felt that this was an insult that was intolerable. But in his anger and frustration, how did he (like most young people) overcome the current difficulties? The playwright of "Turning into an Ape-Man" catered to the fantasy of revenge of the general petty bourgeois. Bai Jianping, under the decision to "feel that there is nothing to miss in life and resolutely make an experiment," injected himself with poison. He transformed into an ape-man, and in his outburst of wildness, insulted Mrs. Hu and retaliated against the people he hated. But this method of fantasized revenge, like most young people when they are rationally conscious, made him feel "ashamed and hateful, and greatly condemned by his conscience." When Mrs. Hu came to visit him, he comforted her, returned the money she had seized, and immediately sent the poison to the research lab, "deciding not to try it again." But the second blow followed, Zhang Xuansheng, who made him lose his love and his job, was about to marry his lover and also insulted him. "Under this stimulation," Bai Jianping's reason was again disillusioned, "feeling that in this turbid world, only the actions of beasts can deal with everything." So he injected himself with poison again, transformed into an ape-man. At this time, he not only attacked the Mrs. Hu and Zhang Xuansheng he hated, he even hated all mankind. He insulted every woman he met and tore up banknotes. As a result, when he was shot and killed, he only received Peilin's cheap sympathy: "He was made this way by the environment." Yes, every young person, even every Chinese person, is oppressed by the harsh environment, and that is more than losing love and losing a job. To survive in such a dangerous environment requires constant effort and struggle to smash the shackles of evil forces. Lamenting and sympathizing do not help the facts, and may even lead to more terrible consequences!</p>
<p>Speaking of making horror films, we must admit that we cannot beat Hollywood. For example, the terrifying atmosphere when the ape-man appears in this film is not enough. When Jianping transforms, he cannot use lighting or sound to enhance the tense atmosphere. But the director also has his own efforts. For example, after Bai Jianping lost his job, he used frantic piano music to accompany his inner turmoil. When Jianping met Zhang Xuansheng in the research room, first there was Zhang Xuansheng's voice, followed by a close-up of Zhang Xuansheng. Behind him was the model of the ape-man, on the one hand showing Zhang Xuansheng's terribleness, and at the same time giving Jianping a stimulus, causing him to inject himself with poison again in order to fulfill his desire for revenge.</p>
<p>Wang Yin's performance as the ape-man is very serious. The best scene is when Peilin comes to tell Zhang Xuansheng that she is moving to another place to get married. When he is in great pain, his own poisoning is about to break out again. He hands the pistol to Peilin and asks her to use it for self-defense in case of emergency. When he falls onto the sofa to transform, the combination of inner pain and the pain of the poison breaking out is performed very realistically.</p>
<p>The sound recording of this film is rather blurry, and the lighting is a bit dim.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Spring Arrives at Green Beryl, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, the Moon Fills Li Lake</p>
<p>After their meal, they didn't dare to delay any longer and sent Wu Junsu back to her school. Originally, this Soochow University was jointly run by China and the United States. Counting all the departments together, there were more than 8,000 university students. Only the liberal arts, medicine, and science departments were located in Greater Suzhou. In addition, a law school was still located in Shanghai. An agricultural college was located in Kunshan. An engineering college was located in Wuxi. There were also twelve affiliated middle schools in Changzhou, Yixing, Taicang, Changshu, Songjiang, and Jiading. Combining the university and middle school students, there were more than 20,000 people. Among them, there were not only Chinese students, but also foreign students. Among the foreign students, there were naturally more Americans, but there were also British, French, Germans, Siamese, Indians, and Filipinos. Statistics showed that 3% were foreigners, and the rest were Chinese. Among the teachers, 30% were foreigners, and the rest were Chinese, but among these 30%, Americans also accounted for the majority. Zhu Airen hurriedly sent Wu Junsu back to Soochow University, fearing that she would miss class. Fortunately, when they arrived, it was still early. Wu Junsu also wanted to lead the two Miss He around the school for a tour. Zhu Airen said, "Forget it! Just walking around your school will take half a day. It's better to come back another day and ask for guidance! Otherwise, I also have two friends in the medical school, and I won't have time to visit them either." Wu Junsu also had class and didn't have time to entertain them, so she said, "Then, Dr. Zhu and the two elder sisters, if you come again, be sure to send me a letter. I am very sorry that I couldn't entertain the two elder sisters. Furthermore, in our liberal arts college, there is a drama research association, and they perform a few plays a year. The next performance is coming soon, but the date has not been set yet. When that day comes, I will send you tickets and invite you to see the play. I will also invite Danyu to come. You must come." The two Miss He both said, "We will definitely come! We will definitely come!" Wu Junsu was a person who liked friends very much. Although she had only spent half a day with Shuangyu and Liyu, she felt that they had a common interest and were two good companions. At this time, they were reluctant to part. After Zhu Airen sent Wu Junsu to school, she discussed with the two Miss He in the car, "Elder sisters, tell me honestly: are you going to stay in our hospital this time, or are you going to stay at my grandfather's Freedom Village? Staying in the hospital is inevitably noisy, but going to Freedom Village is much quieter and more comfortable. But I am hindered by my medical work and cannot come to Freedom Village every day. This is a regret." It is said that the moon pavilion and cloud building are for guests to live in, and the mountain village and waterfront are for guests to come to. (60)</p>

<h3>Arts and Entertainment Circles and Disaster Relief Movement</h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>Relief for refugees is everyone's responsibility and obligation. People in the arts and entertainment circles are no exception. On the contrary, they should make the greatest efforts and be the pioneers for all walks of life. In this regard, people in the arts and entertainment circles seem to have already begun their mission. For example, the first standing committee meeting of the Arts and Entertainment Broadcasting Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association unanimously resolved to gather people from the arts and entertainment broadcasting circles in the city to continue their efforts to assist in the disaster relief work. This is indeed a good phenomenon; however, in my opinion, if the disaster relief movement in the arts and entertainment circles is only carried out by broadcasting people alone, its effectiveness will not be widespread and significant. We should unite all the practitioners in the arts and entertainment circles in Shanghai, whether they belong to the film, drama, storytelling, broadcasting, opera, dance halls, etc. Everyone needs to unite and stand on the same front to work together on a large-scale disaster relief movement in the arts and entertainment circles. In addition to each entertainer wearing a "Philanthropy Medal" donated by the Shen Bao, they should also persuade their relatives and friends to save unnecessary waste in life and walk on the path of "it is a joy to do good." Because our saving two yuan can teach a refugee a semester of production education and learn a skill to make a living, which is very easy for us to do, but the refugees will benefit infinitely. People in the arts and entertainment circles should indeed take on the great responsibility to vigorously promote this practical and effective disaster relief movement.</p>
<p>I hope with all my heart that every arts and entertainment practitioner will do their best to "move people to do good" in their own work, and highlight the significance of refugee production education, so that under the leadership of fellow comrades in the arts and entertainment circles, the tens of thousands of refugees on the "isolated island" who are "homeless" or "unable to return home" can gain the skills to make a living and solve the difficulties of life, which is truly a immeasurable achievement.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on Newsreels</h3>
<p>— Dai Zi</p>
<p>European and American News Events Can Be Shown in Shanghai in One or Two Months. Cameramen, Like News Reporters, Must Be Quick-Eyed and Quick-Handed</p>
<p>The fall of Barcelona in the Spanish war, the earthquake in Chile, and the death of the Pope in Rome, these events all happened in the last month or two. But newsreels about these events could already be seen in Shanghai cinemas last week. Those who don't know the inside story may wonder if there is something special about the production and transportation of these newsreels that makes them so fast.</p>
<p>In fact, the rapid production and screening of newsreels is due to the air traffic. After the cameraman shoots the new event, he sends it back to the company by air mail, and the film company rushes to develop and edit it successfully, and then transports it to major cities around the world by air. All major newsreels with news value are produced and transported in this way.</p>
<p>The Hollywood film companies, which are larger in scale, have special departments for the production of newsreels. Among them, Fox Film Corporation attaches special importance to the shooting of newsreels. They have resident cameramen stationed in various parts of the world, especially in capitals and major cities. In this way, if an inevitable or accidental new event occurs in a certain city, it can be captured on camera, and the film can be sent back to the company, sorted out, and edited to make a complete newsreel.</p>
<p>All accidental events, such as major fires, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, etc., are not known in advance and are accidental. Therefore, after the event occurs and the news is received, the cameraman immediately goes to shoot, which is unexpected and accidental. As for inevitable events, such as various commemorative ceremonies, grand gatherings, military parades, naval and military exercises, etc., news is received in advance, and on the date, you can bring a camera and go to shoot.</p>
<p>When shooting newsreels of fixed events, the value of the news may sometimes change and fluctuate due to changes. For example, one day the king attends a military parade and personally inspects the army. The cameraman has received the news in advance, and on that day, he brought a camera and prepared to shoot, but there was a temporary change. The king could not attend due to illness or other reasons and sent a representative to inspect. Then the value of the newsreel taken was lowered. Similarly, during the parade, if the king was assassinated or a car accident occurred, or a riot broke out, the value of the film taken would be increased. This unexpected gain was not known to the cameraman in advance.</p>
<p>If a cameraman specializes in shooting newsreels, in addition to having photography skills, he must also be familiar with journalism. In a new event, certain shots cannot be missed, certain shots can be abandoned, and certain shots must be taken in close-up. Two cameramen shoot the same news, and the results are different. The quality depends on the photography skills and the differences in the selection and omission from the perspective of journalism. In short, a cameraman who shoots newsreels, like a news reporter, must have a sensitive mind, be quick-eyed and quick-handed, and shoot shots that others cannot shoot to be considered outstanding!</p>
<h3>Casual Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhi Bai</p>
<p>Mr. Yang, in this journal's discussion of opera at Chunjiu Lu, said that Yan Shishan was Yan Lanqiu (son of Jiuzhenfeng), which is actually wrong. Shishan is the son of Lanqiu's younger brother, Lanting, and is also not the grandson of Zhu Sishi (Wenying). However, Shishan's art was actually taught by Lanqiu himself, so he was able to inherit the mantle of his uncle and surpassed Song Dezhu, Zhu Shengfu, and others, becoming one of the best of the younger generation of female martial artists.</p>
<p>The lower partner (i.e., the one who takes the hit) is even more important for female martial artists than for male martial artists. Because female martial arts plays often emphasize the strike, if the lower partner is slightly worse, it will be difficult to see the brilliance of the strike. The lower partners of famous female martial artists such as Jiuzhenfeng and Zhu Guifang are all famous figures. Yan Shishan's father, Lanting, used to be the lower partner of Jiuzhenfeng. He and Jiuzhenfeng co-starred in "Stealing the Immortal Herb" and took various dramas from Jinling. Their strikes were extremely wonderful, like a green leaf setting off a peony. Zhu Guifang's lower partner is Zhu Xiangquan, who is also related to Guifang. He is good at playing the monk in "Sizhou City" and is also a leader in martial arts.</p>
<p>Sun Erniang in the play "Cross Slope" is also a play that female martial artists should perform. Wu Song is also the protagonist in the play. In his early years, Gaitian always had Qi Caifen play Sun Erniang. Qi was the "wine master" of female martial artists in Jiangnan. He and Gaiwu's performance was truly seamless. After Gaiwu retired, Qi changed to Zhang Yipeng as her partner. The last time Gaiwu came back to the stage and performed "Renewal," he tried hard to find a talented female martial artist. Although Zhou Jufang joined, Zhou was definitely not a top talent. This time, Gaiwu performed again and invited Shui Shangpiao to cooperate. Shui Shangpiao is difficult to compare with Qi Caifen, but her experience and reputation are similar to Qi's, and she is ultimately better than Zhou Jufang.</p>
<p>There are even fewer talented female martial artists in Jiangnan than in the north, and they have become as rare as morning stars. Only one in a hundred is valued. Only female actor Fen Juhua once supported the market for a while, but now Fen Juhua's art has declined, and because she is old and her beauty has faded, she is no longer valued by the world. She has even been reduced to Ying'er in Qunping Mountain. Therefore, in practical terms, Jiangnan simply does not have a perfect female martial artist talent.</p>
<p>Child star Ye Xiaozhu is Lucy's younger brother and Zhao Dan's brother-in-law. In "Mulan Joins the Army," he loudly said: "Sister, if you can't beat those guys, just write a letter back, and I will help you!" He also played a role in "Transformation into an Ape-Man." He seems to be a promising child.</p>
<h3>A Great Undertaking by the Hong Kong Drama Troupe: A Collective Performance to Commemorate the Martyrs of Huanghuagang</h3>
<h3>(Nie Ge)</h3>
<p>More than 40 drama troupes co-star in a great historical drama to express the spirit of sacrifice of the 72 martyrs.</p>
<p>The China Art Drama Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association initiated a collective performance of the great historical drama "Huanghuagang" on the anniversary of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang (March 27) to express the spirit of sacrifice of the 72 martyrs for the revolution. Other drama troupes in Hong Kong and China responded one after another, and within two days, more than 40 units joined, such as the China Travel Drama Troupe, the Times Drama Troupe, the Iron Current Drama Troupe, and the Amateur Drama Troupe. All professional and non-professional drama troupes in Hong Kong and China, as well as drama troupes in schools, have joined, creating the greatest grand occasion in the history of the Hong Kong drama movement. After several meetings, a standing committee has been established to be responsible for the progress of this matter. The standing committee is based on the unit of the troupe and selected the China Art, China Travel, Times, China, Xiangjiang, and Guangdong six drama troupes as standing committee members. Li Hua, representative of China Art, is the secretary, Zhu Baishui, representative of Xiangjiang, is the director of drama affairs,  Jia Bao, representative of China Travel, is in charge of publicity, and the representative of Times is in charge of general affairs. At the same time, Ouyang Yuqian, Tang Huaiqiu, Lu Dun, Li Jingbo, and Hu Chunbing were selected as a five-person director group to execute the "Huanghuagang" (the collective performance of the drama).</p>
<p>It is also heard that all the ticket revenue from the performance on this day will be used to help the refugees.</p>
<h3>A Downtrodden Singer in a Song Hall</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Lu Qingyuan, an old actor who recently partnered with Zhang Wenjuan at the Times Theater, is a proud disciple of Wang Changlin. Among the Peking Opera circles in Yanjing, De Zijie (called Ma Dezi by the people) was considered the best in his early years. After De, Zhang Hei and Wang Changlin can be called two difficult ones. Xia Yueheng is also famous. Zhang Hei's martial arts are far superior to Changlin, but he is timid in speech. Changlin's martial arts are slightly inferior, but he is known for his crisp dialogue. In addition to Zhang Hei, Changlin, and Yueheng, there are also Fu Xiaoshan, Lu Qingyuan, Ai Yunfei, Yue Chunlin, and Wang Fushan. Among the younger generation, Ye Shengzhang is now considered an outstanding performer. Lu Qingyuan studied under Changlin, and whatever Changlin can do, Qingyuan can do it too. Around 1914 or 1915, when I was a guest in the old capital, I often saw him performing at the Civilization Garden, partnering with the Yu Zhenting brothers. His dialogue was crisper than Fu Xiaoshan's, because Xiaoshan suffered from shortness of breath when reciting. Later, because his affairs were not liked by his teacher's wife (Changlin's wife), Qingyuan was stubborn and resolutely left Beijing. Before leaving, he told his best friend: "If my teacher does not die, I will not return to Beijing." After coming to Shanghai, he was known as the number one martial arts clown for several years. Whenever a famous baritone from the south performed "Fishing and Killing Home," they were happy to have Qingyuan play the role of the teacher, whose dialogue in this play was exactly the same as Wang Changlin's, without any deviation. His demeanor and posture were also very similar to his teacher. He once co-starred in "San Cha Kou" with Gai Jiaotian and was also famous at the time. Later, due to addiction, his physical strength declined and his martial arts also declined. One year, Yang Xiaolou came to Shanghai and personally visited Qingyuan, telling him that Changlin often thought of him and asked Xiaolou to take him back to the old capital when he returned to Beijing. Qingyuan politely declined. After several years, Qingyuan planned to return home for personal reasons. A famous actor came to Shanghai and said to Qingyuan: "Your teacher is sick in Beijing." Although Qingyuan missed Changlin and wanted to return north to see his teacher, he was afraid that if Changlin died before he returned north, his teacher's wife might say something unfavorable to him, so he decided to stay in Shanghai. After Changlin passed away, Yang Xiaolou sent another letter urging him to go north. At this time, although he was grateful for Xiaolou's kindness, his physical strength had declined. Even if he returned to Beijing, once he took the stage, he would no longer have the spirit of his active years. He had no choice but to reply and thank him. Now Wang Changlin and Yang Xiaolou have passed away, and Qingyuan is also getting old. With Qingyuan's youthful vigor, how could he have expected that he would be down and out in the Times Song Hall today? Several years ago, Mr. Chen Yong'an in Shanghai held a grand regular meeting every summer, hosted by Mr. Jiang Zicheng, who would invite old actors in Shanghai such as Rui Debao, Zhang Rongkui, and Lu Qingyuan to show off their skills. Such a grand occasion can no longer be seen today.</p>
<h3>Recent Events in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Xin Yan</p>
<p>Yi Hua Company has recently established a relationship with  Industry Bank, and a certain American company has taken over management, so it is expanding significantly. The first blockbuster of this year has been set as "Wang Baochuan." The director is tentatively set as Wu Cun, but Wu is the basic director of Datong Film Studio and is currently being borrowed. It is expected that it will not be difficult to succeed. As for the leading actors, it is rumored to be Hu Die, and some say it is Zhang Cuihong. I don't know which is true.</p>
<p>It is a fact that Wang Yuanlong has joined Xinhua.</p>
<p>Shu Shi has been promoted to the director of drama affairs at Datong Film Studio. It is heard that three new directors will appear at the studio, which is worth noting.</p>
<p>Jin Yan recently played Lin Chong (i.e., "Snowy Night  Revenge Record"), which is directly comparable to the Wu Song he played before. This man is truly a character from Water Margin.</p>
<p>A certain observer said that this year will be the year of the revival of costume dramas, and the output will account for more than 80 percent, which is credible.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Court and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (119)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>"Linked Rings" is a group play in martial arts dramas.</p>
<p>Tianba felt really ashamed and regretted it very much. He felt unspeakably sad. Fortunately, an old elder brother, Ji Quan, was next to him, hinting to him to kowtow to Brother Zhu to apologize. Seeing that he admitted his guilt and submitted, Guangzu's anger disappeared, and he sincerely advised him: "In the future, you, the deputy general, should be less tempered." In this way, they were able to better understand each other's temperament; and Tianba was willing to correct his mistakes, of course, the friendship became closer. Looking at the people now, nineteen out of ten are greedy for profit and forget righteousness. They are afraid of harm and avoid it as much as possible. How many people are like Zhu Guangzu, willing to hide it from the public and get things done successfully by themselves, and then let their friends know his intentions. In recent society, people talk big first, but nothing actually happens, but they brag about how things will be. When a friend really needs them, they shirk and retreat. Looking at it this way, it is really not as good as the green forest people in the past, who still understood the meaning of righteousness. My personal temperament is very happy to make friends, but I feel that today's friends are extremely difficult to make, because now the word "make" has been changed to "use." Use is only temporary, or once or twice. After using each other, the friendship ends. Therefore, whenever I see plays like "Linked Rings" and "Copper Net Formation," I feel a sense of emotion. The word "righteousness" in the new life's rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame certainly includes a wide range, but the four words "valuing righteousness in making friends" are certainly included in it. Many people's views on "Linked Rings" are all focused on Bao and Huang, but my personal opinion is that I admire Zhu Guangzu's courage and thoughtful consideration. He secretly thought that their Third Uncle Huang (San Tai) had superb martial arts in those years. With his ability, he almost lost to Bao Erdun in the martial arts competition at Li Family Shop; if he hadn't changed his consistent principle of not fighting secretly and secretly released a whip, injuring Bao Erdun's left arm, I am afraid that he would have failed in all likelihood. Tianba's ability is not comparable to his father's, and Bao Erdun will definitely practice hard to avenge the whip he received in those years. Although he is slightly older in recent years, he is a famous "Iron Arhat" and is not like other flower-picking thieves who are old, weak, and whose martial arts have declined. If Tianba cannot win, he will have to fulfill his promise to admit guilt for his father.</p>
