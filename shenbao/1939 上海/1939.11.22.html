<h3 id="c9">蘇日談判商約與中國 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>英國路透社昨日傳布莫斯科電訉如左：</p>
<p>蘇聯外長莫洛托夫與日大使束鄉，已依允以最惠國條件爲基礎，開始商的之談判；雙方意見之交換，現仍在最初步之階段中。談判地點，尙未決定，蘇聯欲在莫斯科談判，但日方因駐莫斯科之大使館中未有商業專家，故欲在東京開議。查蘇日間貿易，目前殊屬細微，且未有擴張之某礎，但醞釀中之談判則頗重要。其要點在於蘇聯力謀改善對日政治關係，庶在西睡更可自由運用其手腕也。此項努力之成功，大都視蘇聯對華態度而定。此間若干觀察家雖信蘇聯準備放棄援助中國政府，俾與日本獲得妥洽，但其他觀察家觀於蘇聯傳統已久之在華政治活動，對於上說表示懷疑。</p>
<p>右電云云，實分兩段落，應分別觀之，其一，關於所謂蘇聯與日本行將開始談判商的，以最惠國條件爲基礎，雙方對談判地點問題之意見參商；此數點，是消息，消息依據客觀事實；揆之路透社平日服務成績，消息當屬可信。其二，關於所謂談判之重要性，蘇聯力謀改善對日政治關係之意念，爲謀西陲更可自由運用手腕之動機，蘇日談判商的與蘇聯對華態度之聯繫，以及觀察家兩種不同之觀察；此數點，是見解，見解發於主觀審量；揆之英國人戰時以神經過敏而忠得患失之心理，見解難期準確。</p>
<p>吾置信於路透社所供給之此項消息，顧未欲重視此消息。誠以蘇聯與日本之間，具有恢復正常關係之可能，吾人旣屢屢言之：而訂的通商，固國際至平凡之正常關係也。雖蘇聯之意念行動，最難捉摸；彼與德國簽訂商的無幾日，即進一步而簽訂互不侵犯條約，更發酵而形成國際今茲劇變之局；事在本年八月間，距今無幾時，白雲蒼狗，盡在世人耳目；若以蘇德兩國關係開展之途徑與方式，推之蘇日兩國之間，則所傳談判商的，自有足使人驚疑其前途者；其實不容作如是觀，更無所用其驚疑。遑論蘇聯對付國際，若必循一定途徑，必取一定方式，則蘇聯之意念行動將不難捉模，而蘇聯亦將不復成爲世界之謎。就事論事：德國與日本，逈不相侔；蘇聯對德國之作用與期待，完全異於蘇聯對日；日本對於蘇聯之作用與期待，完全異於德國對蘇；故蘇德間當初秘密勾結，蘇日間行將公開談判；故德國外長里賓特洛浦負重致遠，躬赴莫斯科，斯能有作有爲，一鳴驚人；而日本僅以使館館員無商業專家爲理由，計較談判之地點；故蘇德之所成就，超越一般政策，而蘇日之所計議，殆惟一般技術。總之，一切殊絕，豈可齊觀，何必重視！不必要之重視，母乃亦將不免於神經過敏之譏。</p>
<p>更有觀察家以爲商的倘能完成，蘇聯對日，或將輸出小量木材，煤油，及五金；日本對蘇，得輸出大量之人造絲，紡織機，電料電具，並出讓商船漁船。此則理解蘇日兩國經濟供需初非密切適應，以說明蘇日訂的通商，雖在經濟上亦無多大關係者也。此一觀察，自有是處然吾人又以爲並非簡單至此。</p>
<p>蘇日此際進行談判商的，在貿易之外，別有政治意義；如此看法，吾人與有同感，但不同於路透電所述。剖析言之：謂蘇聯力謀改善對日政治關係，庶在西陲更可自由運用其手腕：其實就蘇聯本國而論，明知日本侵華兩年半。精力消耗垂盡，豈能更向蘇聯尋釁；在德義日集團囂張之際，日本容有與德義相呼應　而與蘇聯啟釁之可能，今則時過境遷，斷無其事矣；故蘇聯雖欲在西陲運用手腕，儘有自由而無顧忌，亦即絕無力謀改善對日政治關係之必要。（二）日本侵華，未能逞所欲爲，乃不責諸己而遷怨於人，以爲他國若不援華，則中國不能抗戰而日本可以恣肆；故力謀改蘇日間之政治關係者，或爲日本，斷非蘇聯。（三）德國與英法對抗，廣求與國·得蘇聯守善意中立而聲援之；彼於日本，今已不復奢望與之共同作戰，但願得蘇聯爲之「橋梁」，取得間接聲援，同時慫恿蘇聯，結歡日本，使母黨英法；蘇聯對日態度之趨於溫和，即所以勉盡橋梁之義務；此其成敗，無關蘇聯，故蘇聯對日，不必自己作何犧牲，蓋所關者德國，原是爲人作嫁而已。（四）若謂蘇日或竟演進而至同盟關係，此則必須兩前提，一蘇聯變更國策，決心跳入漩渦，參加彼所謂帝國主義相斫，一日本孤注一擲，不但決心與英法作戰，且須決心與美國作戰；此兩前提決不成立，故蘇日決不同盟。（五）中日戰爭尙未解決之際，蘇聯若深入於遠東問題，則無論對中日兩國如何左袒右袒，其意義與影響，微妙而深遠之極：就現階段而論，則蘇聯爲信守中蘇互不侵犯條約之精神計，爲第三　際之根本方略計，爲彼之亞洲領土避免威脅計，與其犧牲中國，助長日本，無寗交好中國，消耗日本。</p>

<p>大中社云、記者頃因週來滬市米價在漲未已、前昨兩日雖稍見回、但距前此工部局限價尙遠、爰特走謁虞洽卿氏、叩以用何方式、制裁囤戶及投機商、以戢漲風、據虞氏表示、此次米價之所以如是暴漲者、初係社會上有力人士對此重要問題、均漠然視之、致形成如此現象、現滬上各公團各機關、以及公正人士、工部局等、均能軫念民生疾苦、進行集議裁制投機米商及囤戶操縱市價之有效方法而實施之、而上海市商會亦正在草擬具體補救辦法、想從今以後、當不致再有此不近人情之漲風發生矣、</p>
<p>米價上漲　主因所在</p>
<p>此次米價突然暴漲、全市居民、驚駭異常、咸蹙額愁眉、鰓鰥以日常生活爲慮、雖前昨兩日、各種米糧俱已下跌、但市民已成驚弓之鳥、尙不敢抱樂觀、大中社記者、以「民以食爲天」、若日常生活不以困難爲慮、則專心一志、方能各就本位努力、特於昨日上午、往訪某米業鉅子、據談、此次米糧價格暴漲主因、內容複雜、決非一因一事、所能造成、查戰前行家與號商、皆可自由買賣、直接交易、戰後因鞏固組織、統一交易、以防奸商乘機操縱起見、特另組「市塲管理委員會」、各米號須向市塲登記銷售數目、以費統制及釐定價格、法至善也、詛料因此而養成一般囤戶之慾念、實際行市、完全操縱於大擴客之手、此非彼時所能料及、查操縱起源、在過去戰前、因交通暢達、每日從京滬滬杭陸路及水路船隻由蕪湖等產地運滬之米、每日到貨若干、及滯留途中若干、無法統計、故雖有利慾薰心之徒、即欲操縱、亦無法得以實行、戰後則一反常態、因產地大都淪陷、而滬上四郊及水路交通、均須受日方之嚴厲檢查、往各地採辦米糧、非有「採辦證」不可、雖僥倖獲得採購、而轉輾運滬、亦成一絕大問題、因此、而每日到滬之米糧數目、一般囤戶掮客、瞭如指掌、滬地每日所需若干、與到滬之數目、相差若干、旣胸有成竹、當然任所欲爲、大做其心思」、毫無顧忌、一般正式行商、雖有壓平價格之願望、然大權已旁落、亦無能力、兩日來市價下落之原因、係前昨到滬之米頗擁、每日均有五十餘車、一般不良行商、目覩來源逐日彙合、而米號業與市民、反俱存觀望、非至迫不得已、不進貨、不購貯、致此輩不良行商無法久持、不得不忍痛降價吐售、以後供求相應、不足之數、隨時墊補、價格亦決無再看上漲之理、</p>

<p>赴美使命　報告工作</p>
<p>大陸報云、華洋義振救災會總幹事貝克博士、</p>
<p>今（二十一日）晨偕夫人乘柯立芝總統號輪離滬赴美休假數月、記者於昨日（二十日）走訪之、據貝克博士稱、渠抵美後主要使命之一、爲使美國公衆詳知在華敎會、中心地二百處、在戰區內從事工作、頗著成效、但耗費亦巨、除敎會中心地而外、並有分站頗夥、</p>
<p>戰時救濟　頗具偉績</p>
<p>自戰起以還、與有緊急需要時、隨時積極從事救濟、而不顧艱險、得公私方面援助之救濟團體、爲華洋義振會·美顧問委員會·與上海國際紅十字會等、經敎會機關而對貧苦者、予以種種援助、當中國恢復和平而開始復興工作時、此等敎會機關、殊有功用、能有效而撙節的從事工作、吾人希望長此繼續救濟工作、至不復需要而後已、</p>
<p>從事建設　亦有成就</p>
<p>華洋義振會爲將來計、已發動經濟上之救濟方法、在若干區域內、主持建造公路與灌漑計劃等工程工作、其中尤以在川省內主持之工作、頗得當局贊許、故國府與省府及公署均予資助、俾使工作擴大、</p>
<p>農民貸款　仍應擴充</p>
<p>又在川省等數區內、義振會委託當地委員會與工業合作運動會舉辦農村信用放款、已往數年來、貸予農民之款、幾已悉數收回、此種信用放款、應予繼續與擴充、貸款予中國農民、至少有百分之九十九、安全可靠、戰事結束時、經濟復興之重要計劃中、信用放款、亦居其一、</p>
<p>復興工作　必要條件</p>
<p>中國之復與工作、若管理得宜、資力充足、則比較的易於辦理、蓋從事復輿工作者、祇須有容身處與工具已足、中國一般人民得此兩物、幾立即專心工作、而滿足其本人與家庭之微薄的需要、彼等所需之工具、亦頓簡單、固不若泰西所需者之複雜也、</p>
<p>華人特質　非常偉大</p>
<p>再、中國人民、具有不消耗光陰之特質、一俟獲機、立即努力工作、乃使復興工作、簡易良多、中國人民具此性格、可於下述一事顯示之、一九三一年間、義振會僱工人一百五十萬人、在六個月內沿黃河重建長逹五千哩之防堤、估計此項工程與繞赤道而建高闊均達六呎之堤相等云、</p>
<p>貝克博士　貢獻良多</p>
<p>按貝克博士於二十三年前之一九一六年十一月來華、任當時北京政府交通部顧問、歷時十年、編繕初九冊之中政府鐵道年報、其重要供獻、爲使鐵路計算與統計趨於標準化、一九三零年、在南京任鐵道部顧問、在職三年、旋復在財政部等供職、但貝克博士乃以救濟管理者最著聲名、自一九三七年八月起、從事戰時救濟工作、任上海國際紅十字會董事、目前之工作、大半爲管理美國助華之救濟基金、此外、並在許多社會福利機關中擔任職務、</p>

<p>局方分別　提出交涉</p>
<p>關於日本憲兵隊扣留華捕兩名事件、已由工部局警務處長與日本憲兵隊·並由該局與日本總領事館·分別交涉、</p>
<p>詳細報告　交工部局</p>
<p>大陸報云、公共租界警務處與義軍當軸雖曾同作營救之努力、但警務處華捕兩名、昨日（二十日）仍遭日憲兵隊覊禁中、警務總巡鮑恩少校昨致函上海日憲兵司令官三浦少將、要求釋出兩華捕、義軍當局曾於星期日使警務處試用西捕頭艾格堡與女檢查員得釋出者、今亦從事磋商、關於此事之詳報、已彙交工部局、局方昨正硏究該報吿、未取行動、但預料今日（二十日）將有所行動矣、</p>

<p>竟欲解交　偽方法院</p>
<p>據日方所發表之消息稱、此案目下不僅暫難解決、且將引起更複雜之局勢、又聞偽方面擬以「殺人未遂罪」對被拘之二華捕起訴、而將彼等交與滬西僞「地方法院」審訊、</p>

<p>— 黃自强</p>
<p>十二號打電話到米店喊五斗米，問他價錢是二十六元八角。我們夫婦兩人和一個女僕，五斗米可以吃一個月。那家米店已交易了四五年，不論什麼時候送米來，都是到月底才付賬的，這幾年來，我很感謝那位跑街先生懂得薪給階級的困難。這一次打了電話去，到第二天還沒有送米來，勉强維持了一天，第三天我上寫字間的時候，親自到米店去灣一灣。在門口就碰見那位跑街先生，他一見我，堆着滿面的笑容向我道歉，說「這兩天實在忙不過來，下午一定送到。」說着他就吩咐推小車的，什麼地方送一担，什麽地方送五斗，眞是十分忙碌的樣子。</p>
<p>下午回家，出店剛送米來，但是發票上的價錢漲了三塊，是二十九元八角。我就向出店的交涉：「我是三天前喊的，是二十六元八角。」</p>
<p>「先生，這是賬房里開出來的發票，我們不知道！」</p>
<p>這自然是實情，出店的職務祗是按地址送貨；可是他說話的神氣，彷彿譏笑我不懂得「早晚市價不同」。臨走時，他果然又補了一句：「明後天還要漲呢！」</p>
<p>兩個月以前曾吃過三十五元的米，米店老闆知道做人不能不吃飯，米價拚命上漲，有什麼辦法呢？不過做生意也得講「公道」，三天前喊的就得依照三天前的行情，我不願意無緣無故吃虧一元五角錢，又跑到米店去交涉。</p>
<p>跑街先生似乎懂得我的來意，我沒有開口，他先來這末一大套：</p>
<p>「這兩天的行情眞是日漲夜大，米的來源又少，吃戶知道要漲價，都是十担五担的囤着……你黃先生是老交易了，不過，這兩天的門市生意，我們也是向同行拆來的，就是預早付了定洋的，也得照當天的行情結賬呢……」</p>
<p>又是堆了滿面笑容，「下决補償，你黃先生也小在乎這一二塊錢！」</p>
<p>好了！這篇外交詞令完全塞住了你的嘴。第一，你沒有付定洋，即是倖定洋的，也得照市價結賬。第二，來源稀少，喊到米彷彿還是你的運氣。第三，把一切責任推到吃戶身上，誰呌你們十扭五担的囤起來？</p>
<p>我向他的笑臉看看，實在無話可說。他呢，似乎也不在乎你這個每月五斗米的主顧，又忙着踏進賬房間去談什麽一交易」去了。</p>
<p>無形損失二元五角錢，還是小事，照這情形發展下去，下個月或許又要吃四十元的米了，不禁打了個寒噤！</p>
<p>可是報上吿訴我們的是「新穀登塲，秋收豐盛，」亦非來源阻塞，存底不足，一那末爲什麽要「日漲夜大」呢？吃戶十担五担的囤積，想來還不致會影響如此之大吧？</p>
<p>我臨走時又向那斗大的「米一字看了一眼，仿佛見到有無數人頭在「米」字四週游來泳去；又看到賑房間壁上的綢幛，四個「以義爲利」的大字要跌下來的樣子。</p>
<p>嗚呼！「利之所在！」</p>

<p>— 隱名</p>
<p>大約爲了吸引一般賭客的緣故吧，在特殊勢力保護下「歹土」內的賭塲，都儘量地僱用婦女來充任招待職司。聰明的老板們的目標是競爭營業，所以做一個女招待的資格必須年靑貌美，口嘴伶俐。</p>
<p>被社會所摒棄，鄙視的她們一羣，却須有着「大亨」模樣的有勢力者底介紹，纔能踏進那地獄也似的魔窟服役。她們祖任的是搖缸」，「吃配」，「裝烟」等的職務。爲了要迎合賭博的時間，所以她們的日常生活也漸漸地由正常而轉變成畸形，以夜當白晝地缺乏了睡眠時間來工作，時常使一個身體康健的女子跌進疾病衰弱的懷抱，而臉黃肌瘦地藉了些胭脂香粉來「鬼混」。而且那些賭徒都是抱定「醉翁之意不在酒」的態度，這些可憐的女招待們就成了老於慣弄女性者的獵物，種種的恥辱臨到她們的身邊，却又不敢反抗一句。－賭塲老關還管得這些？他們正需要女招待的「色」去招引賭客吓</p>
<p>筆者曾經和一個女招待談話，她以前還是臉蛋紅紅女郞，現在，經過了近四月昏沉的生活，撫了撫她冰冷的手背，簡直使我跳起來，我勸吿她說：</p>
<p>「金錢是不能購買健康的，那種職業又不是正當的，我想你還是重過着淸苦的生活－你要明白那是害人匪淺的機關！」</p>
<p>她沒有表示一點意見，我開始追問她的生活情况，因爲她是我的遠親，所以坦白地說了出來：</p>

<p>第十八回　談經濟繁榮興舊市　述婚姻掠奪溯遺風</p>
<p>且說東吳大學校的小印刷所，每星期發行一次校刊，銷數倒也不少。除此之外，學校中許多講義，也由他們那裏印的。從前有許多學校中，印講義都是用油墨機印的。那是小規模的學校，校內並沒有鉛字印機的。這些油印的講義，要寫得齊整，印得淸楚，不然便弄得一場胡塗。而且至多也只能走近百張，到蠟紙一碎，完全不能印了。有了這鉛字印機以後，誰用那種油印機，而况這幾年工夫，因爲印刷術是文化上最重要的工具，近來又發明了不少了呢。我們且不談這信託服務社的種種，只說她們六位小姐，從吳君素的寄宿舍出來。她們預備仍舊坐了朱愛人的汽車到火車站，可是去的時候，朱愛人開了車，朱愛人也是要到上海去的。回來的時候，怎麼辦呢？不能把車子丟在火車站。雖然火車站也有寄車子的地方，但是上半天去了，下半天就回來的，可以把車子寄在那裏。此刻愛人到上海，有幾天躭擱，便是星期一，也不知道能回來不能回來。所以吳君素的意思：是不必一定要坐愛人的汽車到火車站，把愛人的車子，寄在此地學校裏，另外雇二輛汽車去，其價也便宜得很。現在因爲中國自己能出產汽油，平常的載客汽車，也是中國自己的汽車製造廠製造的。從東吳大學到火車站，不到二十分鐘，車資不過八角光景，又沒有小賬，總算是挺便宜的了。吳君素說：「我們已有六個人了，雇二輛汽車，是舒服一點，每輛坐三人。」邵慧華道：「那可不必，你們雇一輛大號汽車就是了，我可以仍坐我的機器脚踏軍去。也許我的車子快，比你們先到，我就可以把車子交給他們行李車裏了。』大家說：『也好！』原來那時的租賃汽車行，常有好幾種汽車。有運物車，有團體車，有大型汽車，有小型汽車。所謂運物車，便是從前的那種搬塲汽車。所謂團體車，和公共汽車勞髴，不過裏面裝置比較攷究，每一輛可坐二十餘人，以供團體旅行之）用。大型汽車，便是剛纔邵慧華所說的大號汽車，照例連開車的司坐七人。至於小型汽車，不過可坐兩三人，用油旣省，價錢也很便宜。（二〇五）</p>

<p>到了冬天，西北風一起，居民少不了要想個取暖方法。身擁巨資的富豪們，毫無疑義的，必定是什麽水汀，電爐，壁爐以暖身。可是貧窮階級，要求一飽，已經難事，所以多數人都用煤球爐來作他們禦寒用具，因爲日中可以煮飯，夜裏又可放在臥房中取暖，一舉而兩得。但是常識淺薄的居民，往往中毒而喪失了他們可貴的性命。如最近報上已經發現了愛文義路一二八五弄九號洪姓婦人，及愚園路四明別墅五十七號內李姓二起中煤毒的新聞。假使天氣再嚴寒一點，恐怕還要更多呢。因此將中毒的現象及防治的方法寫在下而，希望一般用煤爐取暖的居民注意。</p>
<p>中毒的現象</p>
<p>木炭或煤的主要成分是碳，在空氣中燃燒，則與氧化合而成二養化碳。如開鎖室內，而燃燒的時候，便能變成養化炭。此炭性質很毒萬一吸入人體，即可與血素相混合，形成氧化碳血色素，因此阻碍養氣的呼吸，而發生窒息狀態。患前初覺頭昏腦漲，呼吸短促，皮膚發靑紫色，血壓高昇，大汗如注，瞳孔收縮，眼球突出，最後因知覺消失，呼吸困難，心動停止而死。</p>
<p>防治的方法</p>
<p>至於中毒以後的處治方法，最主要就是使患者脫離原來的房間，置於通氣的所在，使息者得到充分的淸鮮空氣，但不可使患者寒冷。因受冷之後，往往可以能陷息者於絕境。所以必要的時候，還須用一個熱水袋帮助，使息者增加熱氣，這樣便急使人工的呼吸法，使養氣充分的輸入，等到患者能呼吸後，方可停止此項手續。乃繼續予以熱茶熱湯等品，使患者逐漸淸醒。</p>
<p>最後我們要記得兩句話。「閉戶不可燃爐，燃爐不可閉瞳。」就是燃燒以後有感覺到氣悶的時候，須立即通開門戶，絕不可因循忽視。</p>

<p>二十年前，飛機發明還不多久，機上的駕駛員能藉無綫機話筒，在三千呎高空和地面交談，一般人已了不得的驚奇。但到目下，飛機上更可以開闢無綫電活動影戲台，當飛行時，一面攝取地面景物，同時把景物向地面放，射程可及三十英哩之遙，地上凡置有電傳影戲機的，都有收看的機會。</p>
<p>歐美各國對於雲中的傳影技術，正在努力試騐，德國的成績最佳。把電傳影戲台裝在天空，專家認爲最困難的是：第一無綫電機件所佔面積要小，使飛機可以容納，但它的電力射程又要大；第二是光綫問題，高空中沒有强烈的光綫，使所攝的目的物十分淸晰，大抵在六千呎高空開攝，地下僅可望見一個輪廓。</p>
<p>雲中影戲的成功，在娛樂方面，極新奇流動性之能事，在實用上效力更廣。任何地點發生意外巨變，如海嘯，地震，火山噴射，都可一一傳達眞相。用在軍事上面，它可以作爲參謀本部的總耳目。它可以報吿砲彈的射程，陸軍司令如要實地調查前綫部隊配備狀况，用不着躬蹈砲火只要派出一架傳影飛機，昇空十五分鐘後，便在銀慕上見到一切。預料將來積極發展之後，更可以從百哩外，攝取敵方的隊伍動作，製定攻守戰略，展開第四空間的幕後大活動。</p>

<p>今天晚上，上海業餘音樂界在八仙橋靑年曾舉行音樂大會。上海自稱爲「孤島」以來，對於歌詠運動，我是以最大的耐心等候着的；我明白「此時此地」的環境，同樣，我也明白在各業餘團體中，歌詠小組是怎樣的活躍着，成爲無數的潛流，然而，當聽到內地的歌詠巡動如何在如火如荼地活動的時候，或者，當靡靡之音從收音機中傳出時，我却會禁不住的煩燥起來，沒來由的會感慨於孤島歌詠運動的沉默</p>
<p>但我明白，「此時此地」的戰略是韌的戰略，方針是「永遠地抵住」，積小勝爲大勝，所以一點一滴，也就不能隨便放棄，至於各自作戰，彼此都屬「業餘」，原是實情，但如果團結之後怎樣呢？團結之後而又有計劃有步驟又怎樣呢？每個團體每星期担任三刻鐘，七個團體也就能担任了一個節目。就不這樣，至少在一個星期內，播一次特別節目，總也毫無問題也是好的。</p>
<p>可是上海在成爲「孤島」以來，却不曾有過這樣的播音團體出現，陳歌辛氏在新新電台嘗試過了，可是後來又停播了。</p>
<p>現在是上海業餘音樂界有牠第一次的聯合音樂大會了，單以這一點來說，就値得我們高興之至。孤島的業餘音樂界，是可以團結一致的，是有餘力可以「有所爲」的，可是也正因此，就史覺得過去我的遺憾之爲遺憾，而希望此後的歌詠同志們補正這個「遺憾」，這不是不可能的。</p>
<p>孤島的逸情風氣越來越兇，在音樂界也並無二致，如何撲滅這逸情風氣，音樂界也正是這期間的崗位之一。</p>
<p>「聞雞起舞」，在這决音樂大會中，不必問聽衆如何，演出者的上海業餘音樂界諸同仁，你們自己就有怎樣感想呢？打算以後如可做呢？</p>

<p>Shaoguan: The Japanese troops entrenched in Qinzhou have suffered heavy casualties. As of the 21st, Chinese and Japanese forces are still locked in a stalemate in the northeast of Qinzhou County. The fighting is quite fierce. On the afternoon of the 20th, two Japanese planes flew over Hepu for reconnaissance and dropped bombs in Beihai. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military news: The Japanese army has recently transferred troops from Foshan and Sanshui in Guangdong Province and Shandong Province, joining forces to land near Beihai, Qinzhou County, and Fangcheng, and then advanced in separate routes. The Japanese troops in the Fangcheng area have been heavily surrounded by the Chinese army and subjected to fierce attacks. The Japanese troops in the city are showing signs of wavering. The Japanese troops in Qinzhou County initially launched a fierce attack to the north, but are now being met head-on by the Chinese army and blocked on the outskirts of the city. In general, the Japanese troops advancing north have been severely blocked by the Chinese army. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, the Japanese troops attacking Nanning, although numbering as many as two full divisions and advancing in three routes, have had their left and right wings blocked by the Chinese. Although the central route has made some progress, it does not dare to venture deep because the left and right wings have been obstructed. The central route of the Japanese army departed from the west of Qinzhou County, north of Qinzhou Bay. The left wing of the Japanese army advanced along the old Qinnning road from Qinzhou County. Communist guerrillas once advanced to Datang, 50 kilometers south of Nanning. The position of the Chinese army south of Nanning has now been greatly stabilized. The Chinese army leaders in that area are trying to concentrate their forces to inflict a major blow on the Japanese army. Although a small number of Japanese troops have landed near Beihai, the city of Beihai is very peaceful. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman told reporters this afternoon that the Japanese troops advancing towards Nanning have been blocked by the Chinese army north of Qinzhou and Fangcheng. Therefore, the situation on the Guangdong-Guangxi border has greatly eased. The Japanese forces operating in Beihai, consisting of two divisions, landed at four locations between November 15th and 17th, and then advanced inland from Qinzhou and Fangcheng. At present, the Japanese troops in Qinzhou have been blocked by the Chinese army to the north of the area, and the main force of the Japanese troops in Fangcheng has also been blocked near the city. A portion of these Japanese troops has moved northeast to Dasi. Another small detachment of Japanese troops has gone further north, advancing to Datangxu, but has now been blocked by the Chinese army on the Guangxi border. The spokesman also said that the Japanese army originally planned to advance towards Nanning in three routes, with Dasi as the central route, Qinzhou as the right wing, and Fangcheng as the left wing. Now that its two wings have been blocked by the Chinese army, the central route of the Japanese army cannot continue to advance north. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to the latest military news from Guangxi Province, there is fighting in the northeast of Qinzhou County. Thirty-two Japanese planes bombed various cities in Guangxi Province yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, fourteen Japanese planes bombed Nanning. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Shaoguan: At 1:05 PM on the 20th, Japanese planes bombed Dashe Hai, opposite Guantouling in Beihai, and at 1:30 PM on the same afternoon, Japanese planes attacked Beihai City, dropping bombs in Dijiao. There were no Chinese losses. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a military spokesman, the Japanese attempt to land in Beihai is not a recent one. For the past six months, Japanese warships have frequently gathered and cruised off the coast of Beihai, repeatedly attempting to land. However, due to the close vigilance of the Chinese garrison, they have not succeeded. This time, the Japanese army forcibly landed more than 10,000 people in Beihai. On the surface, it seems to have an active intention to invade. However, from a strategic and political point of view, it is judged that the Japanese goal is to cover up the defeat in northern Hunan and to stimulate anti-war sentiment in its own country. Although the Japanese army advanced very fiercely after landing, the Chinese army, with the strongest calm, began the most violent encirclement and annihilation in the mountainous areas outside the range of Japanese naval artillery. Therefore, the Japanese army's coming here is no different from repeating the mistakes of the Battle of Northern Hunan, and it is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Guilin: More than 30 Japanese planes bombed Nanning and other counties on the 21st. In addition to dropping bombs in the suburbs, they also distributed absurd leaflets. Wuming, Guixian, Binyang and other places were also bombed. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi Issues Letter to the People; Cai Tingkai Ordered to Defend Nanning</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, issued a letter to the people of Guangxi after returning to Guizhou, urging them to prepare to resist the Japanese invasion. In his letter to the people of Guangxi, General Bai emphasized the cooperation between the people and the army. They must do their best to destroy highways and completely remove laborers and food from the vicinity of the war zone as early as possible to prevent them from being used by the enemy. This policy is obviously a revival of the scorched earth policy. Past Japanese offensives have repeatedly failed due to this. It is also heard that General Cai Tingkai has been ordered to defend Nanning and is not allowed to retreat until every last soldier is gone. The Chinese have now dispatched troops along the Xijiang River to reinforce Nanning. At the same time, the elite Guangxi troops currently in Guangdong have also been transferred back to Guangxi to fight. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Guilin: Director Bai believes that the time has come to mobilize the people to defend the country and their hometowns as the Japanese army is pressing the border. He specially telegraphed the Guizhou Provincial Government, calling for the convening of village and street people's conferences throughout the province to mobilize the people to cooperate with the military forces, pay special attention to highway destruction, and thoroughly implement the empty field policy, in accordance with the National Convention and the Military-Civilian Cooperation Convention, to give the Japanese army a head-on blow. The provincial government has instructed its subordinates to comply with and implement this, and plans to start from the provincial capital, with all civil servants actively participating to take the lead. According to Qiu Changwei, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Japanese troops who landed near Fangcheng have been resisting by the Chinese forces step by step, and the Japanese morale has been frustrated. Moreover, there are not many troops, so it will not be difficult to annihilate them. During this time, we should vigorously promote village and street people's conferences, mobilize the people of the province, and give the Japanese army a severe blow. Our various preparations in the past were to strike at the Japanese. Now that the Japanese are approaching the provincial border, it is time for us to exert our strength to strike at the Japanese. We should step up mobilization efforts and implement a protracted war of resistance. As for the people in cities close to the war zone, we still hope that they will follow the government's plan and evacuate to avoid suffering innocent harm. (Dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, Reuters of Britain disseminated a dispatch from Moscow as follows:</p>
<p>The Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the Japanese Ambassador Togo have agreed to begin trade negotiations based on the most-favored-nation treatment. The exchange of opinions is still in the initial stages. The location of the negotiations has not yet been decided. The Soviet Union wants to negotiate in Moscow, but the Japanese side wants to open the meeting in Tokyo because there are no commercial experts in the embassy in Moscow. At present, the trade between the Soviet Union and Japan is very small, and there is no basis for expansion, but the negotiation is very important. The main point is that the Soviet Union strives to improve its political relations with Japan so that it can more freely use its methods in the west. The success of this effort largely depends on the Soviet Union's attitude toward China. Some observers here believe that the Soviet Union is preparing to abandon aid to the Chinese government in order to reach an agreement with Japan, but other observers, considering the Soviet Union's long-standing political activities in China, express doubts about the above statement.</p>
<p>The above dispatch can be divided into two paragraphs, which should be viewed separately. First, regarding the so-called imminent commencement of Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations based on the most-favored-nation treatment, and the mutual consultation on the location of the negotiations; these points are news, based on objective facts. Considering Reuters' usual service record, the news should be credible. Second, regarding the so-called importance of the negotiations, the Soviet Union's intention to improve its political relations with Japan, the motive for freely using its methods in the west, the connection between the Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations and the Soviet Union's attitude toward China, and the two different observations of the observers; these points are views, based on subjective considerations. Considering the British people's wartime psychology of being nervous and anxious about gains and losses, it is difficult to expect the views to be accurate.</p>
<p>We trust the news provided by Reuters, but we do not want to attach importance to this news. Indeed, we have repeatedly said that there is a possibility of restoring normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan: and the conclusion of a trade agreement is a normal international relationship. Although the Soviet Union's intentions and actions are the most difficult to grasp; a few days after it signed a trade agreement with Germany, it took a further step to sign a mutual non-aggression treaty, which further fermented and formed the current dramatic change in the international situation; the matter was in August this year, not long ago, and the rapid changes are all in the eyes of the world. If we infer the path and method of the development of relations between the Soviet Union and Germany between the Soviet Union and Japan, the rumored trade negotiations will naturally make people wonder about their future; in fact, such a view is not allowed, and there is no need to wonder about it. Besides, if the Soviet Union must follow a certain path and take a certain method to deal with international affairs, then the Soviet Union's intentions and actions will not be difficult to grasp, and the Soviet Union will no longer be a mystery in the world. Speaking of the matter itself: Germany and Japan are completely different; the Soviet Union's role and expectations for Germany are completely different from those for Japan; Japan's role and expectations for the Soviet Union are completely different from those for Germany. Therefore, there was a secret collusion between the Soviet Union and Germany in the beginning, and the Soviet Union and Japan will conduct open negotiations; therefore, the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop assumed a heavy responsibility and went to Moscow in person, which could achieve something and amaze the world with a single feat; while Japan only cited the reason that there were no commercial experts in the embassy staff to discuss the location of the negotiations. Therefore, what the Soviet Union and Germany have achieved exceeds the general policy, while what the Soviet Union and Japan are discussing is almost only general techniques. In short, everything is completely different, how can they be viewed the same way, why attach importance to them! Unnecessary emphasis will also inevitably be criticized for being nervous.</p>
<p>Some observers believe that if the trade agreement can be completed, the Soviet Union may export a small amount of timber, kerosene, and non-ferrous metals to Japan; Japan can export a large amount of rayon, textile machines, electrical materials and appliances to the Soviet Union, and transfer merchant ships and fishing boats. This understands that the economic supply and demand between the Soviet Union and Japan are not closely adapted to each other in the first place, in order to explain that the Soviet-Japanese trade agreement has not much relationship even in the economy. This observation has its merits, but we also believe that it is not as simple as this.</p>
<p>The Soviet-Japanese negotiations at this time have political significance beyond trade; we agree with this view, but it is different from what Reuters reported. To analyze it: saying that the Soviet Union is trying to improve its political relations with Japan in order to use its methods more freely in the west: in fact, as far as the Soviet Union itself is concerned, it knows that Japan has been invading China for two and a half years. Its energy is almost exhausted, how can it provoke the Soviet Union; at a time when the German, Italian, and Japanese groups are rampant, Japan may echo Germany and Italy and start a war with the Soviet Union, but now the time has passed, and it will never happen; therefore, although the Soviet Union wants to use its methods in the west, it has freedom and no scruples, that is, there is absolutely no need to strive to improve its political relations with Japan. (2) Japan's invasion of China has failed to achieve what it wants, so it does not blame itself but blames others, thinking that if other countries do not support China, then China cannot resist the war and Japan can be reckless; therefore, it is Japan that is trying to change the political relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, not the Soviet Union. (3) Germany is confronting Britain and France and is seeking cooperation with other countries. It has obtained the Soviet Union's good-faith neutrality and support; it no longer expects to fight together with Japan, but only hopes that the Soviet Union will be a "bridge" to obtain indirect support, and at the same time encourages the Soviet Union to make friends with Japan, so that it will not offend Britain and France; the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan is becoming more moderate, which is to fulfill its obligation as a bridge; the success or failure of this is irrelevant to the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union does not have to make any sacrifices itself, because what matters is Germany, and it is originally doing it for others. (4) If it is said that the Soviet Union and Japan may even evolve into an alliance relationship, then there must be two prerequisites: first, the Soviet Union changes its national policy and decides to jump into the whirlpool and participate in what it calls imperialist infighting; second, Japan makes a desperate bet, not only decides to fight against Britain and France, but also decides to fight against the United States; these two prerequisites will never be established, so the Soviet Union and Japan will never form an alliance. (5) When the Sino-Japanese war has not yet been resolved, if the Soviet Union delves into the Far East issue, then no matter how it favors or opposes China and Japan, its meaning and impact will be extremely subtle and far-reaching: as far as the current stage is concerned, in order to abide by the spirit of the Sino-Soviet non-aggression treaty, for the fundamental strategy of the Third International, and for avoiding threats to its Asian territories, it is better to befriend China and consume Japan than to sacrifice China and help Japan.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can get a general overview of the scope of the so-called Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations. As for China, it internally grasps the confidence in resisting Japan and building the country, and externally grasps the human sympathy beyond national borders; at the same time, it sees through that Japan is deeply trapped in the quagmire, and in any aspect of military, political and commercial affairs, it has no power to act and no qualifications to act; therefore, China faces various international changes today, pays attention to it and has no hesitation; moreover, from the perspective of international politics, China is actually containing millions of Japanese troops, and is actually containing a strong power in the world. This is especially the basis for China to get along well in the international community.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The United States Warns Japan Again Against Obstructing Commercial Interests in China; Welles Discloses Report From Consul in Tianjin; Shows Deep Concern About Soviet-Japanese Relations; US and Soviet Union to Hold Important Talks in Washington <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Washington: US Undersecretary of State Welles told the press yesterday that the US government attaches great importance to Japan's continued interference with the trade of American people in Tianjin. According to the official report received by the State Department, although the US government has notified Japan several times that American people have the right to trade in China without interference from any party, Japan's interference is increasing day by day. US diplomatic representatives and consuls in China and Japan have all notified Japan of this attitude. According to a report to the State Department on November 13 by Carter Welles, US Consul in Tianjin, difficulties continue to arise in transporting goods from the Japanese blockade line in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. There were only a few cases of obstruction of American expatriates, but the time that American goods were detained was as long as one month or more. American businessmen in Tianjin have constantly expressed their opinions on this matter. In Carter Welles' report, it was mentioned that the Japanese military authorities ordered American merchants to unload the coal and peanuts loaded in their cars onto the ground during inspection, and forced them to count the peanuts. Coal merchants were also forced to calculate the price of coal. Another American carpet merchant holding a pass was forced by the Japanese army to spread the carpets loaded in his car on the street. British expatriates who carried food into the British concession were also greatly obstructed. The coal supply in the British and French concessions in Tianjin is insufficient. Although there is still stock on the other side of the Baihe River, that area is in the Japanese-occupied area. Observers attach great importance to Welles' remarks. Welles' move may indicate a change in the State Department's policy. In the past, the US government did not make public the reports of American consuls in China until a formal protest was lodged with the Japanese government. Observers also mentioned that the State Department issued a report in mid-December last year, saying that it had lodged more than 600 protests with Japan, but the Japanese ignored them. Therefore, protests are now ineffective. It is believed in all circles that Welles' move indicates that the State Department's policy from now on will allow the American people to know about the anti-American actions taken by the Japanese in China one by one, and is a consistent expression of the US government's announcement of the cancellation of the US-Japan trade agreement. Welles' remarks are also an indirect response to Japan. Japan's various actions in China have made it impossible for the US and Japan to renew the trade agreement. Although Welles' remarks mostly discussed the situation in Tianjin, it can be proved in his discussion of US-Japan relations that the State Department is now paying attention to the study of the Far East issue, and the possibility of the Soviet Union and Japan concluding a trade agreement is worthy of attention. Another point that Washington is paying attention to is that, according to unconfirmed news, the Soviet Union will sell its submarines in Vladivostok to Germany so that Germany can take action against the Allied ships in the Far East. For all these reasons, the United States' observation of the situation in the Far East is complicated. Observers believe that in this situation, the United States will insist on the "open door" in China. (United Press dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: US Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky is scheduled to hold talks within this week, but the date has not yet been determined. He said that the Soviet Ambassador hopes to discuss with the United Kingdom several issues that are "closely related" to the Soviet Union. (Haitong dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>Manila: According to Mr. Wu Zhifang, an employee of the Central Bank who arrived here today on the "Comfordy" along with Mr. Kong Lingkan, son of Kong Xiangxi, China is able to resist Japan for the long term because of its rich salt resources, which is beyond the expectation of the general public. He also stated that the solidity of China's financial foundation can be seen from the recent 35% increase in the value of Chinese legal tender. It is not true that China's foreign trade has gradually decreased, as rumored. Although all of China's seaports have fallen, Chinese products can still reach foreign markets without any immediate interruption. Mr. Wu repeatedly praised the difficult work of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in establishing a new China in the interior. (United Press, 21st)</p>

The ships lost include the Dutch ship Simon Bolivar, the Italian ship Grazia, the Swedish ship Bottelson, the British ship Blackhill, the Yugoslavian ship Kali Gamirika, the British coal ship Torchbearer, the Lithuanian ship Kaunas, and the British fishing vessel Wigmore. According to the latest news, the Simon Bolivar sank in the shipping lane, and it may be necessary to bomb it to avoid obstructing navigation. Official sources announced that 84 people were lost on this ship. In three days, as many as ten ships have sunk after hitting German mines. The London Observer said that Germany has been illegally laying mines in enemy waters for some time. In June 1915, four merchant ships and two destroyers were bombed and sunk in German minefields on the same day. The Simon Bolivar was hit by two explosions, which shows that the mines were laid in a curved shape. This method of laying mines would never be adopted for ships of its own country passing through the area, because even if the navigators had secret charts for avoidance, these secret charts could never indicate the exact location of the curved mines. Although mine-sweeping operations are carried out regularly on the sea lanes where the ships were damaged, German stealthy mine-laying boats can take the opportunity to lay mines. Although Germany denies that the Simon Bolivar was sunk by German mines, no one believes it. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin: After the Dutch ship "Simon Bolivar" sank, the "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" regarded it as the most tragic event in the current naval warfare, believing that the ship's sinking was due to hitting a British mine. The ship had to pass through the English Channel near the southern coast of England, where there were no mines, due to British laying of mines, and was always in danger of hitting mines.

<p>Rotterdam: At the request of the Holland America Line, the Dutch authorities have instructed their embassy in Germany to protest against Germany's recent listing of the Dutch ship "Volendam" on its list of armed regular mail ships. It is reported that 58 British ships and 8 French ships are also listed on the list. As soon as the Germans encounter these ships, they must be bombed and sunk. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>The Hague: The Telegraph recently reported that after the German Navy included the Dutch national ship "Volendam" on its list of armed warships of belligerent countries, the Dutch ambassador to Germany, Mr. Widder, protested to the German government. The reply stated that this was due to a misunderstanding and that it would be corrected. The Dutch government believes that the case is now closed. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>New York: The New York Times commented on Germany's laying of floating mines in European waters to bomb and sink merchant ships, saying that bombing and sinking merchant ships is the most violent economic warfare, and the most violent and indiscriminate tool used is a kind of unanchored mine. The mines may be blown off course by the wind and scattered everywhere. Germany claimed last week that it would use various methods to deal with the British blockade. It is to be expected that Germany will place floating mines on merchant shipping routes to threaten neutral ships, making them afraid to carry goods to Britain and forcing them to trade with Germany. What is noteworthy is that the first victims are neutral countries, which Germany relies on to supply goods. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Berlin: The leader of the Soviet delegation to Germany left Berlin for Moscow yesterday morning to report to the Soviet government. It is expected that he will return to Berlin in a few days. Haitong News Agency learned from responsible personnel that the first stage of the German-Soviet trade negotiations can be considered to be over. The Soviet representatives will inspect German factories to get a preliminary idea of the items that the Soviet Union wants to purchase from Germany. At this point in the negotiations, the Soviet representatives should report to their government. Moreover, since the scope of the agreement to be signed by the two countries is so broad, experts from Germany and the Soviet Union will need to carefully prepare the details of the agreement. This work will require sufficient time to be completed. Therefore, it is difficult to determine when the German-Soviet trade agreement can be implemented. (Haitong, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing – Rumors that the Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Youxin, raised a protest with the Chinese government regarding the relationship between the Nationalists and Communists during the Sixth Plenary Session have been officially denied by the authorities here. Communist officials here have expressed satisfaction with the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session, especially the decision to convene the National Assembly on a fixed date and establish a constitutional government. According to them, there is little serious friction between the Nationalists and Communists, and furthermore, such minor serious friction can be swept away by the recent resolutions of the Kuomintang. According to Communist officials, the recent Central Executive Committee convened by the CCP in Yan'an has made resolutions on military, political, and international policies. Regarding domestic policy, the resolution advocates the establishment of a constitutional government, which coincides with what President Chiang said in his opening address to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Furthermore, all the points disclosed in the declaration of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang yesterday, especially the four points on foreign policy, are fully supported by the Communist Party. It is also said that President Chiang's taking office as head of government can strengthen the administrative organs and eliminate corruption, so the future is promising.

<p>Berlin – Regarding the ten questions on Britain's war aims raised by Lord Ponsonby in the Daily Herald, the German General Dispatch has now responded to each item. (1) Ponsonby asked: "If our last attempt to maintain world peace through democratic politics creates seven or eight autocratic countries in Europe, is our war truly fought for democracy?" The General Dispatch replied: "The 'slogan' of maintaining world peace through democratic politics has the same purpose as today's 'defeat Hitlerism.' In other words, this is a smokescreen for Britain's war aims, carrying out the reality of weakening Germany, misunderstanding the essence of democratic politics, causing most countries to violate democratic principles, and establishing their own organizations." (2) Ponsonby asked: "Can we assert that Britain's victory will achieve a satisfactory solution to the complex organizational problems of Central Europe in terms of ethnicity, territory, and economy?" The General Dispatch replied: "If Britain's victory could solve any problems, the European situation would not have formed today's war situation. The current war in Europe is the direct result of the Treaty of Versailles, that is, Britain's victory. This is widely recognized." (3) Ponsonby asked: "Are we truly going to sacrifice millions of lives because we hate Hitler?" The General Dispatch replied: "Britain's pursuit of this traditional policy will not only sacrifice millions of lives in Britain, but France will also sacrifice millions of lives along with it." (4) Ponsonby asked: "If we are not fighting the German people, then why do we need to adopt measures to starve the German people to death?" The General Dispatch replied: "Britain conceals its war aims, saying that it is not waging war against the German people, which is intended to deceive the world. In reality, it wants to eliminate the German people, so Britain does not hesitate to adopt all kinds of immoral measures to implement its means of starving the German people to death." (5) Ponsonby asked: "Under the current unsound fascist system, can we restrict freedom, control education, interfere in personal affairs, and realize the ideal of socialism?" The General Dispatch replied: "Under the current policies pursued by Britain, it is not easy to make individual social order adapt to the conditions of new-style warfare, or to lead the British people onto the path of socialism." (6) Ponsonby asked: "If we are fighting against aggression, then why do we not fight against Italy, the Soviet Union, and Japan? At the same time, can we absolutely assert that the British Empire, which occupies one-fifth of the world's area, is entirely based on self-defense?" The General Dispatch replied: "Britain has also obstructed other countries' efforts to gain living space, but only the revival of Germany is most in conflict with Britain's dominance in Europe, so it stands alone against Germany. As for the brutal circumstances of the establishment of the British Empire, any history textbook has a clear answer." (7) Ponsonby asked: "Does the British Prime Minister recognize that the main cause of the current difficulties is the Treaty of Versailles?" The General Dispatch replied: "Indeed, the Treaty of Versailles is the source of the current difficulties, and as a result, Europe has been plunged into war twice in 25 years." (8) Ponsonby asked: "Although the Allied victory in 1918 has failed, will it still seek victory through the 'smash through' method this time?" The General Dispatch replied: "The 'smash through' method of 1918 did not prevent Germany's rise, but was the direct cause of Germany's increasing military, economic, and political strength. As a result, a second 'smash through' method is no longer possible." (9) Ponsonby asked: "If one side attempts to expand and the other side prevents expansion, then is it an imperialist war?" The General Dispatch replied: "Britain occupies one-fifth of the world's territory, and Germany is only striving for living space. Is it not an imperialist war to prevent this?" (10) Ponsonby asked: "In any case, a peace conference will be convened. Will this conference be held before the massacre or after it, and can it achieve lasting peace?" The General Dispatch replied: "Hitler proposed to Britain in his speech to the Reichstag on October 6 to convene a peace conference before the massacre, but Britain rejected it and preferred to convene a conference after the massacre."

<p>After arriving in Shanghai the night before last, American Ambassador to China Johnson publicly stated yesterday that he planned to take a boat north today. However, it was learned from reliable sources late yesterday that the ambassador's departure date has been postponed to this Friday (the 24th). At that time, he will take a ship belonging to the Kailan Mining Administration directly to Qinhuangdao. It is also learned that Japanese envoy Katoh, who has been active in Shanghai recently, is scheduled to meet with Ambassador Johnson today to conduct preliminary discussions on issues related to the United States and Japan in the Far East. At the same time, the Japanese side released the information that Ambassador Johnson will continue to meet with Katoh during his stay in Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Katoh Kumataro - Courtesy Visit</p>
<p>Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to meet with Japanese envoy Katoh today, as Katoh will be visiting the American ambassador today as a courtesy. At that time, it is hoped that the two ambassadors will begin preliminary discussions on the relationship between the United States and Japan in the Far East in the past month.</p>
<p>Scheduled Boat Trip - To Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>The question of how long the American ambassador will stay in Shanghai was not reliably answered until yesterday. Ambassador Johnson stated yesterday that he would depart north today, but in fact, the ambassador still has some important matters to be handled in Shanghai in the next day or two. Therefore, according to this newspaper reporter's investigation, his departure date has been postponed to the 24th. He will take a ship belonging to the Kailan Mining Administration directly to Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>Purchasing - Christmas Gifts - in Shanghai</p>
<p>Members of the press visited Ambassador Johnson at the American Consulate yesterday. According to the American Ambassador, although his stay in Shanghai is very short, private affairs are crowding together and urgently need to be handled. At that time, he said to the visitors, "Before going north to Peiping, I need to purchase Christmas gifts, and the time is very limited."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Katoh Visits Colonel <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side announced the night before last that Japanese envoy to China Katoh Kumataro would visit British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr at the British Consulate in Shanghai yesterday morning. According to information gathered by the reporter yesterday, Katoh did indeed visit Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, but the location was at the Shanghai office of the British Embassy in the Jardine Matheson Building on the Bund, not the British Consulate at the intersection of Suzhou Road on the Bund. According to the British Embassy's Information Office, it admitted that Katoh visited Colonel, but the content of the discussions was not released. According to diplomatic sources, Japanese envoy Katoh's mission in Shanghai is to hope to conduct parallel meetings in Shanghai with the US and Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. Although the Tokyo negotiations have not officially begun, Katoh took advantage of the presence of the British and American ambassadors to China in Shanghai to begin exploratory work. The meeting with the British ambassador yesterday was purely a prelude to the Japanese side's request to hold talks with the United States, Britain, and France. It is expected that the Japanese ambassador plans to meet with American Ambassador Johnson within the next few days.</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that the Japanese-language Mainland News in this city reported last night (the 20th) that Japanese envoy to China Katoh Kumataro is scheduled to visit British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr at 11:00 AM today (the 21st) to hold "important talks." It is believed that this conversation will yield some concrete results and reflect the friendly attitude of Britain and France towards Japan, as evidenced by the recent withdrawal of British and French troops from North China. Katoh will also meet with American Ambassador to China Johnson later this week. According to reports, Katoh met with the Italian ambassador D'Amadio on Thursday.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a British-owned factory in Pudong, has been going on for six months since it began. Due to someone's behind-the-scenes support, labor and capital have repeatedly negotiated, but have not achieved any results. Recently, more than 2,000 workers at the factory have been living in extreme poverty due to receiving only 13 yuan in subsidies per month. They unanimously opposed those who were holding up the strike, leading to a sudden change in the long-suspended labor dispute. Yesterday was the day for the factory workers to receive subsidies from the "Grand People's Assembly" in Pudong. After hearing the news of the resumption of work, more than 2,000 workers were overjoyed. The details are divided below.</p>
<p>Labor-Capital Agreement: Resumption of Work Conditions</p>
<p>After several negotiations, the conditions for resuming work between labor and capital are as follows: (1) All wages will be increased by 20%. (2) The nine coppersmiths who were previously fired (these nine people are representatives appointed by the "Grand People's Assembly") should be paid six months' wages as severance pay. (3) All White Russian employees will be suspended. (4) Female workers are allowed to enter the factory through the front door, but they must transfer from Dongchang Road to the front door of Lujiazui to enter the factory. (5) The factory does not recognize the trade union organized during the strike period, but can recognize the existence of the "Grand People's Club" in the future.</p>

<p>After Rear Admiral Hurd, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet, and American Consul-General Gauss welcomed American Ambassador Johnson from Chongqing to Shanghai on the evening of the 20th, they boarded the flagship Augusta and held a general important meeting. Consul-General Gauss also informed the Ambassador in detail about the recent meeting with Japanese envoy Katoh.</p>
<p>Meeting and Discussions - Details</p>
<p>After Gauss sent the American Ambassador ashore, he boarded the flagship Augusta at 9:00 AM yesterday as a guest to meet with American Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre at Baguio in the Philippines this week for an</p>
<p>Important Meeting</p>
<p>To discuss the principles of the United States' commercial relations with China and the Philippines and the Nine-Power Treaty, further research will be added, that is, the United States' strategic problems in the Far East on land and sea. Sayre will also discuss the subsequent Far East command and</p>
<p>Work to Fully Resume - Next Month</p>
<p>Because the factory has been on strike for a long time, some of the machinery has rusted and the belts are full of dust. It must be sorted out before work can begin. Yesterday, the factory notified all male workers and car-wiping female workers in the spinning room, roving room, and steel wire room, as well as machine technicians in the weaving room, to enter the factory to work this morning. As for the factory staff and servants in the writing room, they have already entered the factory to work a few days ago. The date for the full resumption of work is next month, the 1st.</p>
<p>Workers Request - Payment of Relief Funds</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, when the factory workers went to the "Grand People's Assembly" headquarters on Dongchang Road in Pudong to claim their subsidies, the "Grand People's Assembly" replied that it had successfully negotiated the opening of the factory on the 15th and 16th, so the subsidy was suspended this time. However, after all the workers rigorously questioned the statement, they were able to continue issuing the subsidy. Then, all the workers at the factory learned that the factory had allocated a huge amount of relief funds to the "Grand People's Assembly," so they unanimously decided to request the "Grand People's Assembly" to issue one month's salary as relief funds. However, the "Grand People's Assembly" firmly refused to agree. Although the workers repeatedly gathered to request, there was no result, so all the workers were resentful.</p>
<p>Defense Issues</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Hurd will be responsible for everything. After the meeting, Rear Admiral Hurd will tour the naval defenses of the various departments in the Philippines as his first inspection after taking office, remaining in the South Ocean Sea area until he returns north next spring. At that time, Commissioner Sayre may accompany the ship to Shanghai. Consul-General Gauss may return to Shanghai with his family within the year.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Rice Price Storm: Joint Discussions for Effective Sanctions; Major Brokers Manipulate the Market with Impunity; City Chamber of Commerce Drafts Concrete Remedial Measures <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Dazhong News Agency reports: Our reporter, noting the continued rise in Shanghai rice prices over the past week, and that, although there had been a slight decline in the past two days, prices were still far from the previously imposed price limits set by the Municipal Council, specifically visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing to inquire about methods to sanction hoarders and speculators, and to curb the rising trend. According to Mr. Yu, the reason for the extreme surge in rice prices was initially due to the indifference of influential members of society towards this important issue, leading to the current situation. Now, various public organizations, institutions, impartial individuals, and the Municipal Council are all concerned about the hardships of the people and are engaging in joint discussions to implement effective methods to sanction rice speculators and hoarders who are manipulating market prices. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is also in the process of drafting concrete remedial measures. It is hoped that from now on, such inhumane price increases will not occur again.</p>
<p>Rising Rice Prices: The Main Reasons</p>
<p>The sudden and sharp rise in rice prices has caused extreme shock and alarm among all residents of the city. Everyone is frowning and worried, and even the poor are concerned about their daily lives. Although all kinds of rice and grain have fallen in price in the past two days, the citizens have become like startled birds and dare not be optimistic. A Dazhong News Agency reporter, believing that "food is the paramount necessity of the people," and that only when people do not have to worry about their daily lives can they focus and work hard at their respective jobs, made a special visit yesterday morning to a prominent figure in the rice industry. According to the discussion, the main reasons for the surge in grain prices are complex and definitely not caused by a single factor or event. Before the war, dealers and merchants could freely buy and sell, and trade directly. After the war, in order to consolidate the organization, unify transactions, and prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, a "Market Management Committee" was established. All rice shops had to register their sales quantities with the market for centralized control and price determination. The law was well-intentioned, but it fostered the desires of hoarders. The actual market prices are completely controlled by major brokers. This was something that could not have been foreseen at that time. The origin of the manipulation can be traced back to before the war. Due to smooth transportation, the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai daily from Wuhu and other production areas via land and water routes from Jinghu and Huhang could not be calculated. Therefore, even if there were people driven by greed, they could not effectively manipulate the market. After the war, the situation reversed. Because most of the production areas were occupied, and land and water transportation in the suburbs of Shanghai had to undergo strict Japanese inspections, it was necessary to have a "procurement certificate" to purchase rice from various places. Even if procurement was obtained by chance, transporting it to Shanghai became a major problem. As a result, the daily amount of rice arriving in Shanghai was well known to hoarders and brokers. The daily needs of Shanghai and the difference between the needs and the amount arriving were clear to them. With this knowledge, they naturally did whatever they wanted and indulged in their schemes without any scruples. Official merchants had the desire to stabilize prices, but the power had shifted to others, and they lacked the ability. The reason for the decline in market prices in the past two days is that a considerable amount of rice has arrived in Shanghai, with more than fifty truckloads each day. Unscrupulous merchants saw the supply increasing daily, while rice shops and citizens were taking a wait-and-see attitude, refraining from purchasing goods unless absolutely necessary. As a result, these unscrupulous merchants could not hold out for long and had to lower prices and sell their goods at a loss. From now on, supply and demand should be balanced, with shortages being promptly replenished, and there should be no reason for prices to rise again.</p>
<p>Continuing Supply: Prices Drop Another Three Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued to be flooded with arrivals, totaling seven to eight thousand bags. The rice registered by the owners for sale at the Rice Market Management Committee totaled 2,100 bags, an increase of 200 bags compared to yesterday. After the market opened, due to weak demand, rice prices continued to decline. Various types of japonica rice fell by about two to three yuan per stone, and Jiangbei, Beijing, and Wuhu indica rice fell by one to two yuan per stone.</p>

<p>The fake "Avenue Police Station" in Pudong has now arrested Indians employed by foreign-owned factories twice. A few days ago, an Indian walking on the highway near Yangjing was arrested and held in the so-called "court" for more than ten days. It was not until the British consulate intervened that he was released. Unexpectedly, three days ago, three Indian guards from the Gongshang Qingdong Jishi Ironworks were arrested and detained by the "Avenue Police Station" due to a dispute with workers. They also suffered injuries. It is unknown whether the injuries were sustained during the conflict with the workers. One was named Gair, one was named Kerr, and one was named Malai. They were all confined in small rooms. It is reported that after the British side intervened, the Japanese ordered that the three men be taken to Jiangwan. It is still unclear whether they have been released. The British Great Industrial Civil Bureau has lodged a serious protest against the "Avenue" authorities attempting to subject Indians to arbitrarily dispositions under unrecognised "laws".</p>

<p>Dr. Baker, the Director-General of the China International Famine Relief Commission and the Shanghai International Red Cross, returned to the United States yesterday aboard the President Coolidge. At 11:30 yesterday morning, when Dr. Baker boarded the ship at the Jianghai Customs Wharf, many friends went to see him off, including Ambassador Shi and his wife, Ed Fes of the China International Famine Relief Commission, Sun Hongfen of the China Cultural Foundation, former New Zealand Consul-General Zhang Xianglin, Fulu of the American Church Federation, Dr. Gao Ai, a pastor of the American Church, Li Guiyong of the Shanghai International Relief Association, Jin Guanfu of the Nanjing National Relief Association, Gui Yanfang of the Cilian Relief Branch, and Yan Suiliang and Li Guangcheng. The President Coolidge is expected to arrive in San Francisco on the tenth of next month. Dr. Baker is the most familiar with and enthusiastic about Chinese charitable work. It is expected that after returning to the United States, he will further promote disaster relief efforts in China. During Dr. Baker's vacation, the affairs of the International Red Cross and the China International Famine Relief Commission will be temporarily managed by Kanar and Ed Fes, respectively.</p>
<p>Mission to the United States: Reporting on Work</p>
<p>Dalu News reports that Dr. Baker, Director-General of the China International Famine Relief Commission,</p>
<p>left Shanghai this morning (the 21st) with his wife aboard the President Coolidge for a several-month vacation in the United States. Our reporter visited him yesterday (the 20th). According to Dr. Baker, one of his main missions after arriving in the United States is to make the American public aware of the effective work being carried out by churches at 200 central locations within China, in war zones, although at a great cost. In addition to church centers, there are also many sub-stations.</p>
<p>Great Achievements in Wartime Relief</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, relief has been actively provided whenever there has been an urgent need, regardless of the dangers. Relief organizations that have received assistance from both public and private sectors include the China International Famine Relief Commission, the American Advisory Committee, and the Shanghai International Red Cross. Various forms of assistance are provided to the poor through church organizations. When China restores peace and begins reconstruction work, these church organizations will be particularly useful, able to carry out work effectively and economically. We hope to continue this relief work until it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Achievements in Construction</p>
<p>With the future in mind, the China International Famine Relief Commission has launched economic relief methods, presiding over the construction of highways and irrigation projects in several areas. In particular, the work presided over in Sichuan Province has been highly praised by the authorities, and the National Government, the Provincial Government, and public offices have provided funding to expand the work.</p>
<p>Rural Loans Should Still Be Expanded</p>
<p>In several regions such as Sichuan Province, the Famine Relief Commission has entrusted local committees and the Industrial Cooperative Movement to conduct rural credit loans. Over the past few years, almost all loans to farmers have been recovered. This type of credit loan should be continued and expanded. Loans to Chinese farmers are at least 99% safe and reliable. When the war ends, credit loans will also be one of the important plans for economic recovery.</p>
<p>Necessary Conditions for Reconstruction Work</p>
<p>China's reconstruction work, if managed properly and with sufficient resources, will be relatively easy to carry out. Those engaged in reconstruction work only need a place to live and tools. The average Chinese person, with these two things, will immediately concentrate on working and satisfying their own and their family's meager needs. The tools they need are also simple, not as complicated as those needed in the West.</p>
<p>Chinese Qualities are Very Great</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese people have the quality of not wasting time. Once they have the opportunity, they immediately work hard, which makes reconstruction work much easier. This characteristic of the Chinese people can be seen in the following: In 1931, the Famine Relief Commission hired 1.5 million workers to rebuild 5,000 miles of levees along the Yellow River in six months. It is estimated that this project is equivalent to building a levee six feet high and wide around the equator.</p>
<p>Dr. Baker: Many Contributions</p>
<p>Dr. Baker came to China twenty-three years ago, in November 1916, and served as an advisor to the Ministry of Communications of the then-Beijing government for ten years, compiling the first nine volumes of the Chinese Government Railway Yearbook. His important contribution was to standardize railway calculations and statistics. In 1930, he served as an advisor to the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing for three years, and then worked in the Ministry of Finance and other positions. However, Dr. Baker is best known as a relief manager. Since August 1937, he has been engaged in wartime relief work, serving as a director of the Shanghai International Red Cross. Most of his current work is managing the American relief fund for China. In addition, he also holds positions in many social welfare organizations.</p>

<p>Dalu News reports that a spokesperson for an American egg purchasing company told our reporter yesterday (the 20th) that unless Mitsui agrees to treat all competing egg companies fairly, foreign-owned egg purchasing companies in this city will not compromise with Mitsui to resolve the dispute arising from the Japanese company's scramble for eggs. British and American companies have repeatedly had informal contacts and have decided to form a</p>
<p>United Front</p>
<p>to counter the monopoly sought by the Japanese company. The spokesperson directly denied rumors that British companies had reached a sales agreement with Mitsui. A spokesperson for a British company also denied these rumors. It is said that the British headquarters in London is extremely angry at the Japanese company's coercive tactics and does not want to reach a compromise with the Japanese company, but wants to wait for the matter to be resolved through diplomatic channels in</p>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>. The current situation has become chaotic because Mitsui is insisting on being the shipper of goods. Mitsui is now even coercing small Japanese companies to sell eggs to Mitsui, so the situation is becoming even more complicated. According to the aforementioned American personnel, the Japanese side is monopolizing fresh eggs, buying fresh eggs worth about eighty yuan for a price of around sixty yuan. Now there are</p>
<p>about four thousand baskets</p>
<p>of eggs belonging to various companies in this city that have been detained after arriving in Shanghai. Only a small portion of them is returned to the legitimate original gold on a daily basis. Moreover, small quantities of fresh eggs transported to Shanghai continue to be robbed.</p>

<p>The annual fundraising convention of the Shanghai YWCA officially opened on the 20th of this month. More than 130 people attended the grand event, all of whom were well-known female leaders in the city. Mrs. Yu Yangjie served as the chairman of the convention, Ms. Liu Wu Zhuosheng delivered a welcome speech, and Mrs. Bai Yuehan spoke about the significance of fundraising, greatly encouraging all the team members. The order was very solemn. It is reported that this fundraising convention has specially invited Lu Meiseng, Ma Bole, Zhu Wenrui, Hu Yigu, Wei Zengfu, Cao Maode, Mr. Zhu Youyu's wife, and others as advisors, and Yan Fqing, Mrs. Huang Zuoting, and Mrs. Cao Xigeng as chairpersons.

<p>In the area of the extraterritorial roads in western Shanghai, after "August 13th", the concession authorities, in order to maintain local security, nailed wooden stakes and wrapped them with barbed wire around the unnecessary alleys on both sides of the roads to block traffic. This was especially thorough in areas where the concession was connected. After the Japanese puppet troops and police invaded the area of the extraterritorial roads, the order in the area fell into chaos, and gangsters took the opportunity to cause trouble. The concession authorities, adapting to the needs of the situation, added barbed wire in the places where they appeared in order to strengthen defense.</p>
<p>Openings or Complete Removal</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, while the concession authorities were actively implementing winter defenses, the Japanese puppets demolished the barbed wire on Anhe Temple Road, Daxi Road, and Dunxin Road without the consent of the concession authorities, or opened a gap. The southern end of Haige Road, which is connected to the concession, and the Lujia Road in Xujiahui, facing the Fahua East Town, have all their barbed wire frames destroyed. Other places such as Bailinan Road, Lu Xuezai, Ni Guo Road, and Caojiazhai have long been completely sealed off, but recently they have all been demolished by the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Italian Military Assists in Defense, Upholding Justice</p>
<p>Laobesen Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Caojiadu, Bailinan Road, and Jisi Fei'er Road in western Shanghai originally belonged to the defense area of the Italian garrison. It is now known that the Italian military authorities, in order to uphold justice and assist the concession authorities in view of the rampant and unscrupulous actions of the Japanese puppets in these places, which have repeatedly caused trouble, ordered their subordinates to patrol these places on a rotating basis after the Laobesen Road incident on the 19th to stop the troublemakers from acting recklessly. The Italian troops stationed at the Italian barracks at Factory 13, opposite Jiaozhou Park, send a large number of Italian troops to patrol the streets every night. Whenever the concession police are unable to reach them, the Italian troops provide assistance.</p>

<p>Yang Qi, president of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, was appointed five months ago. He colluded with Jin Menglong (a relative by marriage and a trusted subordinate), a corrupt employee of the property department, to abuse his position. Jin transported opium on August 26, intending to sell it. He was intercepted by the patrol force en route, and prosecuted by the court, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Court President Yang Qi was also detained by the High Second Branch and reported to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. A special commissioner was sent to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. The investigation has been completed and he was not prosecuted. He was ordered to pay 5,000 yuan with reliable surety. However, Yang's position as court president had already been revoked by the Ministry of Judicial Administration.

<p>At the Yuheguan Restaurant at the Ningbo Road intersection of Bentang Lane in the Public Concession at approximately 7:00 last night, approximately 20 to 30 improperly dressed customers (local unemployed vagrants) suddenly arrived, occupying various tables and ordering wine and dishes. The waiters were extremely busy. Some people at one table wanted to change their dishes because they did not like the taste. The waiter said that since the dishes had been ordered and cooked, it was difficult to comply. Upon hearing this, the customers were very dissatisfied and began to berate the waiter, creating a threatening situation. At this time, the companions who had previously occupied the tables swarmed over. The noise of the argument reached the outside. Lu Dingan (40 years old, local resident), the person in charge of the restaurant, in order to pacify the situation, rushed forward to express his apologies to the diners. However, the voices were too loud and it was difficult to distinguish right from wrong. The diners then threw bowls and plates, and overturned tables and chairs, resulting in a chaotic scene. Several people grabbed Lu Dingan and punched him repeatedly before stabbing him in the neck, head, waist, abdomen, and other parts with sharp blades, inflicting a total of eight wounds. Blood gushed out immediately, and he collapsed to the ground in pain. Because the wounds were critical, he died shortly after. At the same time, three other waiters suffered minor injuries: Qian Qiaolin, 60 years old, injured in the eye; Wang Juquan, 33 years old, injured in the head; and Wei Shunbao, 18 years old, injured in the face. Seeing the enormity of the crime, the perpetrators scattered like birds and beasts. Subsequently, the Chinese patrolman No. 1436 from the nearby Old Chansen Patrol Station rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. The perpetrators had already fled. The corpse and the injured were immediately taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance. Meanwhile, the patrol station in charge ordered detectives to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Xu Wenqing, a native of Wuxi residing at No. 3 Mingxia Village, Ladu Road, built his own house and worked at Zhenjiang Customs. His daughter, Liangzhen, is 22 years old and is a student at Zhenhua Girls' High School on Avenue Edward VII. In 1929, through a matchmaker, she was betrothed to Pu Shiying (24 years old), the son of the late Pu Zijing, chairman of the Wuxi Lace Industry Association, who was also from the same hometown. When Xu Liangzhen was studying in Zhenjiang, Pu Shiying was studying in Nanjing. Not only did this engaged couple exchange love letters and photos, but they also sometimes gathered together during vacations. Both sides had no objections to the marriage contract. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, they fled separately. Pu Shiying's property in Wuxi was destroyed in the fire, causing the marriage contract to falter. Wu Zhihui mediated, and both parties maintained their old friendship. This spring, Xu Liangzhen hired a lawyer to publish a statement declaring that the marriage contract made by her parents on her behalf was invalid. Pu Shiying, because his fiancée suddenly changed her mind, recently hired lawyer Ma Chang to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation to confirm the validity of the marriage contract, stating that when the engagement was made, in addition to a betrothal gift of 400 yuan, there were also jewelry and gold ingots worth 3.8 taels, making the ceremony grand. The court opened a hearing for mediation yesterday, but because the opposing party, Xu Liangzhen, did not attend, the mediation was declared unsuccessful.</p>

The dancer remained seated for a long time, but eventually, unable to bear the disturbance, she attempted to stand up and return to her seat. The Japanese men dragged her back, pinned her to the ground, and beat her severely, also pouring beer and other drinks on her. At that time, the head of the hall's waiters attempted to step forward and mediate, but was slapped in the face and threatened with a pistol. As a result, the dance hall manager telegraphed the Lao Nao police station in charge, who dispatched Western and Japanese detectives who told the Japanese men to leave. All the dancers and dance patrons left their seats during the disturbance.</p>

<p>Cai Xinghao, a Ningbo native and landlord in Zizheng Lane, Tangjiawan, outside the West Gate, is over fifty years old. Because of his favoritism towards a concubine, his legal wife, Xia (48 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 10 Tongan Lane, Yongan Street), recently hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Yang Yunshi, and Li Gengxiang to file a petition in the Second Special Court's Civil Division for mediation regarding cohabitation. The reason stated was that the petitioner, Cai Xia, married the opposing party, Cai Xinghao, twenty-eight years ago. Unexpectedly, three years after the marriage, the petitioner was treated like an unwanted fan, and another concubine was taken. After mediation by relatives and friends, the opposing party deposited 5,000 yuan in the Ruifeng Qianzhuang in Ningbo, and the petitioner took the interest as living expenses. For more than twenty years, she has tasted the bitterness of life. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the interest from the Qianzhuang decreased, and the petitioner was forced to come to Shanghai, intending to rely on the opposing party for a joint living. Unexpectedly, the opposing party refused. Now, she has no choice but to petition the court to order the opposing party to appear in court for mediation and order the opposing party to fulfill the obligation of cohabitation as husband and wife. Upon receiving the petition, the court arranged for Judge Liao to conduct mediation in Civil Court Four yesterday afternoon. Because the opposing party, Cai Xinghao, did not appear, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful and advised that a separate lawsuit could be filed.</p>

<p>At approximately 12:35 PM on Sunday this week, four Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession's Putuo Road Police Station were searching passengers on a trolleybus on Route 16, Robison Road, when a dispute arose with a plainclothes puppet police officer named Yuan Maogen. This led to interference by the Japanese military police, who detained the Chinese and Western detectives. After negotiations by the police station, the Western detective A. Egberg and a female inspector were released. However, two Chinese detectives are still being held in the puppet police station. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Authorities Present Negotiations Separately</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of the Japanese military police detaining two Chinese detectives, the head of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department negotiated with the Japanese military police, and the council negotiated with the Japanese Consulate-General separately.</p>
<p>Detailed Report Submitted to Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that although the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and the military authorities made joint efforts to rescue them, two Chinese detectives from the Police Department were still detained by the Japanese military police yesterday (the 20th). Major Bowen, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Commissioner, sent a letter to Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese military police in Shanghai, requesting the release of the two Chinese detectives. The military authorities also engaged in consultations yesterday, mirroring their successful effort on Sunday to free Western police chief A. Egberg and a female inspector. A detailed report on the matter has been compiled and submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The council was reviewing the report yesterday and had not taken action, but is expected to take action today (the 21st).</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Shift Responsibility</p>
<p>According to official sources yesterday, the Japanese authorities are now attempting to evade responsibility and deny any involvement in the detention of the detectives, claiming that the detectives were detained by the puppet "municipal government." Negotiations to rescue the two Chinese detectives made no progress yesterday. The Shanghai Times reports that despite repeated negotiations and protests by Police Department officials, the two Chinese detectives remained detained yesterday. Police Department officials' attempts to meet with the two detained Chinese detectives were also rejected. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council intends to lodge a protest regarding the detention of the two detectives as of last night. As of last night, the Japanese side has not provided any valid reason for detaining the two detectives.</p>
<p>Intend to Transfer to Puppet Court</p>
<p>According to information released by the Japanese side, the case is not only difficult to resolve in the short term but will also lead to a more complicated situation. It is also reported that the puppet regime intends to charge the two detained Chinese detectives with "attempted murder" and transfer them to the Shanghai West puppet "District Court" for trial.</p>

<p>Zhao Lianying, a 30-year-old woman from Yuyao currently residing at No. 4, Lane 59, Huacheng Road, is beautiful and charming. Ten years ago, she married Zheng Yanling, a Ningbo native, through her parents' arrangement and a matchmaker. The couple were the same age and looked quite compatible. Zhao, coming from a wealthy family, intended to use a large dowry to help her husband in business, hoping to grow old together. Subsequently, Zheng opened the Weishun Weaving Factory at No. 1 Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession, and Zhao also assisted in the factory. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>The beautiful scenery did not last, and the feelings between the two gradually faded. By the autumn of last year, they were like ice and coal. Later, the two divorced, and Zheng refused to hand over the 2,387 yuan that Zhao had deposited in the Weishun Weaving Factory and Huatong Biscuit Factory. Zhao, believing that Zheng intended to embezzle the deposit, hired a lawyer last month to file a complaint in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zheng of embezzlement. Zheng's defense was that Zhao's deposit had been</p>
<p>Settled clearly in the summer of last year. After questioning by Judge Miao Qingbang, Zheng Yanling was found not guilty, and Zhao Lianying's incidental civil suit was dismissed. Zhao, dissatisfied with the judgment, recently hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file an appeal with the High Third Branch, detailing eight reasons. The High Third Branch approved the appeal. Yesterday, Criminal Division Chief Wu Tingqi, accompanied by a judge and clerk, presided over the hearing in the Third Court. The appellee, Zheng Yanling, and his defense lawyer, Qian Zheng, arrived on time to await questioning. First, the appellant, Zhao Lianying, and her attorney, Yu Hualong, stated</p>
<p>The reasons for the appeal, saying that the appellant and the appellee were originally spouses. Since the lawsuit began in the autumn of last year, the appellant's important clothing, personal seals, and bank passbooks have all fallen into the hands of the appellee. Furthermore, it has been impossible to withdraw the deposits in the factory run by the appellee. The appellee's statement in the ledger that the accounts have been settled is completely fabricated. Therefore, the appellant requested that the original judgment be overturned, and the appellee be punished according to law, and ordered to pay the appellant the deposit of 2,387 yuan. Then, according to the appellee,</p>
<p>Zheng Yanling confessed that the appellant's deposit had indeed been withdrawn. The court then carefully reviewed the ledger presented by the appellee and considered that Zheng Yanling had a strong suspicion of committing a crime. He was ordered to post a cash bond of 2,000 yuan and a business guarantor who was available at any time, and the hearing was adjourned until a later date.</p>

<p>According to Zhong Xiangming, manager of the Zhongyuan Hair Salon, a letter to the editor from He Yutang et al. published in your newspaper on the 18th falsely stated that our salon was opened by Yang Jinhai and that the day Yang was killed at the Wanli Wine Shop was the day of our salon's opening banquet. These statements are not true. The initiator and manager of our salon is Zhong Xiangming, and the assistant manager is Yang Guosen. In addition to the assistant manager, the shareholders include Dong Chaozheng, Chen Longqing, Li Changbao, Lu Yuanshun, Chen Deming, Duan Deyi, Zheng Guohai, Zhu Lianhai, Chen Zhiquan, Sun Guixiang, Wang Houkuan, and Zhou Yanlong. Furthermore, there has never been a person named Yang Jinhai among our staff, let alone He Yutang, Bao Guiqing, Wang Mingtang, or Ji Debao. Moreover, our salon opened in August of this year, so why would we hold a banquet only now? These statements are obviously false and affect the reputation of our salon. We request that your lawyer, on behalf of our salon, send a letter to your newspaper, requesting that it be published in the letters to the editor column to restore our reputation. Respectfully, Wu Xiangxian, Attorney-at-Law, November 21st.</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper, which reports on the accident of a student falling at our school, the facts are slightly inconsistent. On the afternoon of November 20th, at 1:30 PM, the celluloid used for handicrafts on the lead roof of the building caught fire and was extinguished in one minute. The window sills were not burned, and no bones were broken. Only one student, Chen Youmei, injured his left foot. The firefighters arrived but did not take any action to extinguish the fire and left. Classes are still being held as usual today. We are clarifying this to avoid confusion. Respectfully, Shanghai Elementary School, November 21st.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Finance: Supply and Demand Unequal; Gold Market Drops Again; Lowest Level Reached 3,642 Yuan <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market entered a slump again. This was mainly due to reports that the Sino-American banks were about to conduct large-scale loan negotiations, which caused a change in sentiment. In addition, the US dollar showed hardness in the midday foreign exchange market, and the Hong Kong traders' appetite was weak. Although the Tianjin traders continued to cover their short positions from the day before, supply could not compete with demand, resulting in a drop of more than 20 yuan. The morning opening immediately fell by a small 12 yuan to 3,665 yuan. Soon, securities traders began to sell. At that time, the foreign exchange market loosened, and it fell another small 7 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange firm and Tianjin traders came to cover their short positions, and the foreign exchange also softened, which led to a temporary stabilization, rising to a high of 3,675 yuan. Unfortunately, the good times were short-lived. The Qian Tai money exchange firm instead sold off their long positions, and the market became difficult again. The morning closing was only 3,662 yuan. In the afternoon, it became even more unsustainable, with a certain gold firm and general long positions selling heavily. The foreign exchange also reported softening, and the lowest level reached 3,642 yuan. Fortunately, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and short sellers came to cover their positions, pulling it up by 8 yuan to close at 3,650 yuan. Trading throughout the day was still active, about 1,000 several hundred taels. Gold jewelry shops quoted a small increase of 5 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged. Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened slightly lower due to the slightly increased lengthening of the US dollar in the foreign exchange market, causing the situation to weaken slightly, opening down a small 12 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 20 taels to jewelry shops for 3,665 yuan. Subsequently, due to the slight loosening of the foreign exchange and the strong buying interest from securities traders, it increased by another small 8 yuan. Securities traders sold 30 taels to the money exchange firm for 3,657 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm suddenly developed a buying trend, vigorously covering short positions for the Tianjin traders, and the foreign exchange had returned from loosening to unchanged, causing the market to suddenly become stable. Soon, it rose by 13 yuan. A certain money exchange firm bought 30 taels from a peer for 3,670 yuan. Later, because another money exchange firm and jewelry shops came to take profits, there were few buyers for a while, and it fell again to 3,663 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm came to pull it up again, and it rebounded. A certain money exchange firm bought 30 taels from a jewelry shop and 20 taels from a peer, both at a price of 3,675 yuan. Near noon, a certain money exchange firm suddenly stopped buying and instead sold, and the trend became unsustainable again. Although securities traders took the opportunity to cover their positions and make profits, long positions also came to close out, so it ended down 13 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 10 taels to securities traders for 3,662 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to the slight loosening of the foreign exchange market, it opened down a small 5 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm for 3,657 yuan. Subsequently, it rebounded by 3 yuan. Securities traders bought 10 taels from a money exchange firm for 3,660 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm came to sell heavily again, and retail long positions also closed out, dropping sharply by 18 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 20 taels to jewelry shops for 3,642 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and gold firms came to buy back slightly, so it rebounded by 8 yuan. A gold firm bought 30 taels from securities traders for 3,650 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it closed down 27 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 33 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold firms is 10 yuan higher than the quoted price, and the buying price is more than 20 yuan lower. The current premium is about 50 to 60 yuan lower than the quoted price.</p>
<p>Gold jewelry quoted a small increase of 5 yuan.</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael in large jewelry shops was still 375 yuan. By noon, it had increased by a small 5 yuan. As a result, large jewelry shops changed to quoting 370 yuan. New jewelry shops and the above prices were all reduced by 15 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The unofficial markets for British and American exchanges continued to be mediocre, generally starting strong, then weakening, and finally remaining unchanged. However, the underlying trend was still loose. It is rumored that the chief executive of HSBC has gone to Hong Kong, causing various rumors, which have led Chinese and Western speculators to adopt a hesitant attitude, and trading has therefore become sparse. The morning opening was due to a sudden lengthening of the US-British exchange rate, with a difference of 3.625, so it showed a strong British and hard American exchange market. Subsequently, the American bank slightly sold off its positions, while Chinese merchants' buying and selling were inconsistent, leading to a hardening of the market. British gold reached 5 pence 3.4375, and the US exchange rate reached 8.6875. Later, those with profits eagerly bought, and importers also took the opportunity to settle, and the price softened again, reaching 5 pence 2.8125 and 8.59375. By noon, there was a lack of discussion of transactions, and the situation was calm. In the afternoon, Hong Kong power companies, yarn and cotton traders, and American banks all sold, causing the British gold market to reappear at 5 pence 3.4375, and the US exchange rate to be 8.71875. After that, those with profits still intended to sell and buy until the closing, with British gold at 5 pence 3.125 and the US exchange rate at 8.6875.

This was due to the rebound in the exchange rate. After opening, the situation was calm and slightly hardened. A certain bank first sold this month's US exchange rate of 8.625 to speculators. At the same time, another Chinese merchant absorbed the spot US exchange rate of 8.65625. Later, foreign banks did spot British gold at 5 pence 3.4375, and a certain bank resold the spot US exchange rate of 8.6875 to a profitable peer. HSBC's listing remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be large at 0.75. After this, importers suddenly came to settle, and foreign banks in North China still had demand, so the market turned softened. Foreign banks purchased spot British gold at 5 pence 3.125 and 2.8125, and then purchased spot US exchange rates of 8.625 from Datong and a certain bank, and foreign banks' selling price had decreased to 8.59375. The volume of transactions gradually decreased at noon, and the situation turned flat. Until noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 5 pence 3.125 and the US exchange rate at 8.65625, which was slightly softer by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Grain: Rice Speculation Difficult to Curb; Rice Sources Gradually Increasing; Foreign Rice Fixed at 130,000 Bags <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>After the rice price slightly fell back, the market yesterday experienced another surge. Both domestic traders and rice merchants believed that the drop the day before was a reaction to the japonica rice reaching the 40 yuan mark. After a big rise, a small decline, there was still hope of breaking through the 40 yuan mark, so there were quite a few rice merchants who still hoped for the return of the peak, so there was quite a lot of stock in hand. Yesterday, 3,000 to 4,000 bags came from various sources. Buyers seemed to continue to look small, taking a wait-and-see attitude. Stockpilers saw that the situation was not good, and they also had a plan to sell quickly. Trackers followed the stockpilers and competed to sell, and suddenly spot goods and returned goods flooded the market. Unexpectedly, most of the operators did nothing more than stand idly by, so the selling side's shouts went straight down, and a falling trend arose. Regardless of the price of japonica and long-grain rice, all prices had fallen by as much as 4 yuan in the central market. Changte japonica rice was already at 35 yuan, Kunsu and other japonica rice were only at 32-33 yuan, and Yao Lu varieties were around 30 yuan. The price of customer long-grain rice was also only 30 yuan plus a little bit. At this point, the local shops and inland merchants recognized that it had fallen through and took action to buy cheaply, and the situation gradually became active, turning to a tight situation. At the same time, small stockpilers also suddenly took action to search for goods, and the selling side responded accordingly, shouting prices higher again, and the general speculators and large stockpilers also stopped selling and instead pulled in again. Suddenly, the market color broke the silent atmosphere again and suddenly appeared in a sensational state, and the prices rose by 1 to 2 yuan. As a result, the market was tired first and then tight. After matching, the prices were only 1 to 2 yuan lower than the previous market. The closing prices were: Chang japonica 36 yuan, Sukun japonica 34 yuan, Qingsi Bo rice 32 yuan, Luyang pointed rice 33-34 yuan, Customer pointed rice 31-32 yuan, Bianyuan new rice 34-35 yuan, Chen rice 35-36 yuan, Yinyuan 33-34 yuan, transaction volume 5-6 thousand bags.</p>
<p>The morning surge of japonica long-grain rice and the impact of the continued fixing of foreign rice led to profit-takers seeking to sell, and the market dropped by as much as 3-4 yuan. The low price then caused local customer sales and stockpilers to add to their inventories, and the market rebounded by more than 1 yuan. However, it was still 2-3 yuan less than the day before. In recent days, the rice market has been controlled by speculators and monopolized by some parties, and the market price has fluctuated, and it is no longer possible to judge it with common sense. However, the source of customer rice does have a gradual increase in reality. Yesterday, 4-5 trucks arrived from Nanjing, and 3-4 trucks were transferred from other ports. There were also more than 2,000 bags transported by Yangtze River ships. However, they were all piecemeal, and procedures are currently being supplemented for unloading.</p>
<p>After large batches of foreign rice were traded for several consecutive days, japonica and indica rice have been suppressed, and Chinese and foreign merchants have been actively hawking for several days. It is said that 1,000 tons of No. 1 Sigong, which will arrive in Shanghai next month, were sold by Jianyuan Huahang, and Yuanhe Grain and Sundries has an exclusive order. Rice merchants have a joint order of 2,200 tons, which is sold by Heyi Foreign Company and will be loaded onto a ship next month at a price of 35 yuan and 2 jiao. In total, there are already 130,000 bags of seven batches.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Miscellaneous Grains: Flour Prices Stable; Foreign Flour Being Collected <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was stable yesterday. In the main sales area of the flour market, the rocketing rice prices led more common people to switch to eating flour. There were sporadic purchases from Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Hong Kong, and other places. Although there was talk of reducing trucks, it was nothing more than wanting to raise flour prices. Unexpectedly, recently, a group of stockpilers bought foreign flour, such as Pao Tai brand, etc. Because the foreign price to Shanghai requires 12 yuan per bag, the high-end stocks in the market are only selling at several yuan, and foreign flour is dry and can be stored for a long time, unlike the flour from this factory, which is crushed by the factory's rent. Therefore, stockpilers and Nanyang traders are also paying attention to foreign flour, further hitting this flour market. The supply and demand in the market were both low yesterday. The wholesale price of No. 2 flour in the main market area was still 7 yuan and 2 jiao, while the wholesale price of Pao Che, Red Blue Che, and Ke Pan was 7 yuan and 3 jiao. The total turnover was estimated to be more than 40,000 bags.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is still scarce. The new arrivals are all spurred by the rising rice prices, and they are unwilling to loosen the price easily. The highest asking price must be 12 yuan, while the buyer is pressing down hard, causing both parties to find it difficult to approach. It is heard that there are a few transactions of 2-3 trucks of Sujia wheat in the outer market, and the price is still at 11 yuan 7-8 jiao to 2-3 jiao.</p>
<p>2,000 bags of export flour will be shipped to Hong Kong today. In addition, 140 bags of soybeans came to Shanghai from Beisha. There are also 784 bags of soybeans shipped to Hong Kong, and 500 bags shipped to Yantai. Yesterday, 160 pieces of fresh eggs were transported from Beisha.</p>

<p>The securities unofficial market seemed to be slightly stable yesterday, but people's minds were still uncertain, and there was no talk of peace. The morning opening was calm and without any turmoil, and people's minds were also very indifferent. All the short positions on the desk were from the various traders, so it was expected that it would be small and then turn high, so the market price was never able to develop. In the afternoon, the multi-party seemed impatient and struggled again, and a portion of the short positions were covered, and the market price barely raised by 5 fen and 1 jiao. The trend was still just wanting to raise it without strength, and the multi-party and short-party maintained each other's stalemate. The market price finally returned by 1-2 jiao, and the total turnover was estimated at more than 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 41 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>During the stock market trading in the public office of the various industries yesterday, the shares of the China Business Company and its bonds invited the interest of many people. However, those who purchased these shares (especially those who collected them at the current skyrocketing prices) obviously did not pay attention to the reorganization plan previously decided by the company. Comparing it with the methods stipulated in the plan, today's bond buyers will get more than twice as many shares as those who can buy them at the current price in the market. According to this, if you want to balance the difference between the two and prevent it from being disparate, so as not to lose the true value of each other's connection, there is no doubt that the value of the shares should be halved, or the value of the bonds should be doubled. It is not superfluous to provide this kind of market malformation as a reminder. Except for a small number that remained firm, the market was slightly soft, and although the public still strongly supported famous stocks when prices fell, trading decreased compared to before. Rubber stocks remained flat, but investors' eyes seemed to be focused on the coming of favorable developments when prices rose.</p>
<p>London, 20th - Today's listed market prices of British merchants' Far East company stocks, bank stocks continued to rise, the rest were flat. The stock price of the McGarry Bank rose 2 shillings and 6 pence to 8 pounds 2 shillings and 6 pence. The stock price of HSBC rose by half a pound, the British registered stock was 84.5 pounds, and the Hong Kong registered stock was 85 pounds, and the rest had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>London, 20th - Today's listing prices of Chinese foreign debts, the upper range fell by 1-2 pounds, and the lower range was flat. The Rehabilitation (British issue) fell by 2 pounds to 38 pounds, Sino-French US dollar and Chrysler fell by 1 pound each, the former to 47 pounds, and the latter to 27 pounds, the rest unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Yarn and Cotton: New Buyers Emerge Again, Cotton Yarn Suddenly Rises by 10 Yuan <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which has been tired for a long time, suddenly showed signs of recovery yesterday, and the rising trend revived. This is because overseas cotton markets are advancing steadily, and bills of exchange are also hovering on the horizontal line. The combined price of foreign cotton is high, so that the factory's costs are gradually increasing. At the same time, although there is no wholesale demand in South China, sporadic transactions continue unabated, people's minds are excited, new buying winds are slightly rising, and stockpilers are also expanding their courage in view of the above situation, so 20-count double horses have risen by more than 10 yuan to 643 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning due to rising cotton markets in the US and India, and the atmosphere was excited, and buyers were more active. The opening price of 20-count double horses rose by 2 yuan to 634 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange opened automatically, and there was a slight demand from Hong Kong traders, and there were also purchases from Zhejiang. The market situation took another step, and the shouting price slowly moved forward. The 20-count double horse closed at 643 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume in all parties in half a day was 1,590 bags, and the transaction volume on the previous day was 235 bags. The market price of 20-count double horse rose by 11 yuan, double earth rose by 7 yuan, and Tiannu rose by 10 yuan and 0.5 jiao. The factory opened 250 bags of 20-count special Jincheng from Yongan Factory at a price of 638-640 yuan. Yesterday, 350 pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo, and today there are still 270 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 100 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, and 20 pieces shipped to Guangzhou Bay. The amount purchased by each trader is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton transaction gradually became lively. The Shenxin, Anda, Xinsheng and other factories all have a need. This is because the yarn market is gradually showing signs of standing out, and the rising wind of the overseas European and American cotton markets is frequent, and people's minds are raised. The consensus of the industry is to look high. At present, because of the sources in northern Jiangsu, people's minds are pulled flat, so the price of Tongzhou is not rising alone, otherwise it would have been higher. Therefore, some people have begun to order American cotton. This kind of raw cotton is mostly the raw material of 20-count yarn. 3,410 bags of Tongzhou flower arrived, and 3,980 bags came from Beisha. Most of them are piled up in the stacks. Among them, there are not a few people who pack and store the goods with the top-notch body. The current cotton situation is listed below.</p>
<p>American Cotton 140.75 Anda entered 200 bags</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 132.50 Again 1,000 bags</p>
<p>Tongzhou Flower 134.00 134.50 136.00 135.50 Industry 1,500 bags</p>
<p>Mitlin 174.00 Again 100 pieces</p>

<p>American Cotton 140.50 Industry entered 300 bags</p>
<p>Xiasha Flower 133.50 133.00 Again 500 bags</p>
<p>Another message, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, has been very prosperous in recent days. Yesterday, the market opened again due to the rise in the telegraph from Mumbai and Liverpool. Speculators were very active in the market. At the same time, the Mumbai traders were buying in large quantities in the market, and spot transactions were becoming more and more prosperous. Short sellers continued to enter, and as a result, the closing cotton price rose by more than 10 pounds from the previous day. India's forecast yesterday rose by more than 6 rupees compared to the previous day, Egypt rose sharply by more than 50 pounds, and Liverpool rose by 15-6 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transaction, the price of overseas cotton has soared in recent days, the factory transaction is silent, the industry is also too expensive to buy cotton, and it specializes in the New York cotton futures transaction, which is becoming more and more crowded. In the past few days, there have also been more than 10,000 bags of transactions. The long-fiber American cotton has become increasingly scarce in the market, and some colleagues are searching everywhere. The dock delivery price of the cotton market yesterday converted with the US exchange rate of 8.625 (taxes are added separately) is as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American Mittlin 156.80</p>
<p>20 count American Mittlin lower grade 150.60</p>

The price of new goods in foreign warehouses was 52 yuan, and the price of old goods was 51 yuan and 4-5 jiao. The price of transshipment goods rose by 0.5 jiao to 41 yuan and 0.5.

<p>According to the news from Zhangzhou, the bottom stock of Lanzhuzhi is gradually scarce, and the production price is rising step by step.

<p>— Huang Ziqiang</p>
<p>On the 12th, I called the rice shop to order five dou of rice, and the price they quoted was 26.8 yuan. My wife, our maid, and I can eat five dou of rice in a month. We have been doing business with that rice shop for four or five years. Whenever they delivered the rice, I always paid at the end of the month. Over the past few years, I have been grateful that the deliveryman understood the difficulties of those who earn a salary. This time, I called, but the rice hadn't arrived by the next day. We managed to get through one day, and on the third day, when I was going to my office, I personally went to the rice shop to inquire. At the entrance, I met the deliveryman. As soon as he saw me, he greeted me with a broad smile and apologized, saying, "I've been really busy these past two days. I'll definitely deliver it this afternoon." As he spoke, he instructed the pushcart men where to deliver one dan, where to deliver five dou. He really seemed extremely busy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, when I returned home, the deliveryman had just arrived, but the price on the invoice had increased by three yuan, to 29.8 yuan. I negotiated with the deliveryman, "I ordered it three days ago, and the price was 26.8 yuan."</p>
<p>"Sir, this is the invoice issued by the accounting office. We don't know anything about it!"</p>
<p>This was naturally the truth. The deliveryman's job was just to deliver the goods according to the address. However, the look on his face seemed to be mocking me for not understanding that "prices change from morning to evening." As he was leaving, he indeed added, "Prices will rise even more tomorrow and the day after!"</p>
<p>I had eaten rice that cost 35 yuan two months ago. The rice shop owner knows that people can't live without rice, so what can you do when the price of rice rises desperately? However, doing business must also be "fair." The price should be according to the market rate three days ago for what I ordered three days ago. I didn't want to lose 1.5 yuan for no reason, so I went to the rice shop again to negotiate.</p>
<p>The deliveryman seemed to understand my intention. Before I could speak, he launched into a whole speech:</p>
<p>"The market price these past two days has been rising rapidly day and night. The source of rice is also dwindling. Customers know that the price is going to rise, so they are hoarding ten dan, five dan... Mr. Huang, you're an old customer. However, these past two days, even the retail business we've been doing is obtained from our competitors. Even if we paid a deposit in advance, we still have to settle the account according to the market rate of the day..."</p>
<p>He was still smiling broadly, "To make up for it, Mr. Huang, you wouldn't care about one or two yuan!"</p>
<p>Alright! This piece of diplomatic rhetoric completely shut me up. First, you didn't pay a deposit, so even if you did, you'd have to settle the account according to the market price. Second, the supply is scarce, so getting rice is apparently your good luck. Third, push all the responsibility onto the customers. Who told you to hoard ten dan, five dan?</p>
<p>I looked at his smiling face, and I really had nothing to say. He, on the other hand, didn't seem to care about a customer like you who buys five dou of rice every month, and was busy stepping into the accounting room to discuss some "business."</p>
<p>Losing 2.5 yuan intangibly is still a minor matter. If this situation continues, next month I might have to eat rice that costs 40 yuan. I couldn't help but shudder!</p>
<p>However, the newspapers are telling us that "new grain is on the market, and the autumn harvest is abundant." It's not like the source is blocked or the inventory is insufficient. So why is the price "rising rapidly day and night"? The customers hoarding ten dan, five dan, shouldn't have such a big impact, right?</p>
<p>As I was leaving, I glanced at the big character "米" [rice] and seemed to see countless heads swimming around the "米" character; I also saw the silk banner on the wall of the accounting room, and the four big characters "以義爲利" [taking righteousness as profit] looked as if they were about to fall down.</p>
<p>Alas! "Where profit lies!"</p>
<h3 id="e114">Female Hostesses in the Devil's Den <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Anonymous</p>
<p>Perhaps to attract gamblers, gambling dens in "badlands" protected by special forces, employ women as hostesses as much as possible. The clever bosses aim to compete in business, so the qualifications for a hostess must be youth, beauty, and a sharp tongue.</p>
<p>A group rejected and despised by society must have an introduction from powerful figures resembling "tycoons" to enter that hellish devil's den. Their jobs are to "shake the dice cup," "distribute winnings," and "pack tobacco." To cater to gambling hours, their daily lives gradually change from normal to abnormal. They work day and night, lacking sleep, often causing healthy women to fall into disease and weakness, using rouge and powder to appear somewhat presentable. Moreover, gamblers always hold the attitude that "their hearts are not in the wine." These pitiful hostesses become the prey of those skilled at exploiting women, enduring all kinds of humiliation, yet daring not to utter a word of resistance. - Do the gambling den bosses care about such things? They need the "sex appeal" of the hostesses to attract gamblers!</p>
<p>I once talked to a hostess. She used to be a rosy-cheeked girl. Now, after nearly four months of a hazy life, I touched her cold hand and almost jumped. I advised her:</p>
<p>"Money cannot buy health. That kind of job is not proper. I think you should go back to a life of simplicity - you must understand that it's a deeply harmful institution!"</p>
<p>She didn't express any opinion. I started to inquire about her living situation because she was a distant relative of mine, so she told me frankly:</p>
<p>"Alas! It's for a living! My job has no fixed shifts. After eating in the afternoon, I have to go to West Shanghai and come back after the curfew. Sometimes there's gambling all night, and I have to stay up all night without a nap. Some customers are fine, but some are so annoying that they're scary. The gambling den boss thinks it's okay for customers to get handsy -..."</p>
<p>After that short speech, I was stunned. What a terrible "life"! I worry about their future.</p>
<p>Now is the time when the women's community is advocating freedom of occupation. I hope the women's community on "isolated island" pays attention to these "captives of life." After successfully fighting for the employment of women in the post office, give them a helping hand! Give them some enlightenment!</p>

<p>Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Reviving Old Markets; Narrating Marriage and Plunder, Tracing Back to Old Customs</p>
<p>Let's talk about the small printing house of Soochow University, which publishes a school newspaper once a week, and the circulation is not bad. In addition, many lecture notes in the school are also printed there. In the past, many schools used mimeograph machines to print lecture notes. Those were small-scale schools, and there were no letterpress printing machines in the school. These mimeographed lecture notes had to be written neatly and printed clearly, otherwise, they would become a mess. Moreover, they could only print up to about a hundred sheets. Once the stencil broke, it was completely impossible to print. After having this letterpress printing machine, who would use that kind of mimeograph machine? Moreover, in the past few years, because printing technology is the most important tool in culture, many new inventions have been made recently. Let's not talk about the various aspects of this trust service company, but only say that these six ladies came out of Wu Junsu's dormitory. They planned to still take Zhu Airen's car to the train station, but when they went, Zhu Airen drove the car because Zhu Airen also had to go to Shanghai. What should they do when they came back? They couldn't leave the car at the train station. Although there was a place to park cars at the train station, it was fine if they went for half a day and came back in the afternoon. However, Airen was going to Shanghai this time, and would be delayed for a few days. Even if it was Monday, they didn't know if he could come back. Therefore, Wu Junsu's idea was: they didn't necessarily have to take Airen's car to the train station. They could park Airen's car here at the school, and hire two other cars to go, which would be much cheaper. Now, because China can produce gasoline itself, ordinary passenger cars are also manufactured by China's own car manufacturing factories. It takes less than twenty minutes from Soochow University to the train station, and the fare is only about eight jiao. Since there are no tips, it is quite cheap. Wu Junsu said, "There are already six of us, so hiring two cars would be more comfortable, with three people sitting in each car." Shao Huihua said, "That's not necessary. You can hire a large car. I can still ride my machine bicycle. Maybe my bike is faster, and I'll arrive before you. Then I can hand over my bike to their luggage car." Everyone said, "That's good!" It turned out that at that time, rental car companies often had several types of cars. There were freight cars, group cars, large cars, and small cars. The so-called freight car was the kind of moving truck from before. The so-called group car was similar to a public bus, but the interior was more elaborate, and each car could seat more than twenty people for group travel. The large car was the large car that Shao Huihua mentioned just now, which usually seated seven people, including the driver. As for the small car, it could only seat two or three people, and the fuel consumption was less, and the price was very cheap. (205)</p>
<h3 id="e116">Coal Poisoning <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ye</p>
<p>When winter arrives and the northwest wind blows, residents inevitably need to find a way to keep warm. The wealthy, possessing vast fortunes, will undoubtedly use radiators, electric heaters, or fireplaces to warm themselves. However, for the poor, it is already difficult to have enough to eat, so most people use coal stoves as their means of keeping warm because they can cook food during the day and keep warm in the bedroom at night, achieving two things at once. However, residents with limited knowledge often get poisoned and lose their precious lives. For example, recent reports have revealed news of Mrs. Hong surnamed, living at No. 9, Lane 1285, Avenue Road, and Mr. Li surnamed, living at No. 57, Siming Villa, Yuyuan Road, being poisoned by coal gas. If the weather gets colder, I'm afraid there will be even more. Therefore, the symptoms of poisoning and prevention methods are written below, hoping that residents who use coal stoves for heating will pay attention.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Poisoning</p>
<p>The main component of charcoal or coal is carbon. When it burns in the air, it combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. If the room is locked and burning, it can be converted into carbon monoxide. This carbon monoxide is very poisonous. If it is inhaled into the human body, it can mix with blood pigment to form carboxyhemoglobin, thus hindering oxygen respiration and causing suffocation. At the onset, the patient initially feels dizzy and has a headache, short of breath, with cyanotic skin, high blood pressure, profuse sweating, constricted pupils, and protruding eyeballs. Finally, due to loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing, and cardiac arrest, death occurs.</p>
<p>Prevention Methods</p>
<p>As for the treatment methods after poisoning, the most important thing is to remove the patient from the original room and place them in a well-ventilated place, allowing the patient to get plenty of fresh air, but the patient must not be cold. Because after being cold, the patient can often be put in a desperate situation. Therefore, when necessary, a hot water bag must also be used to help increase the heat, and artificial respiration should be administered urgently to allow oxygen to be fully infused. This procedure can only be stopped after the patient can breathe. Then continue to give hot tea, hot soup, and other items to gradually awaken the patient.</p>
<p>Finally, we must remember two sentences: "Do not burn the stove with the door closed, and do not close your eyes while burning the stove." That is, if you feel stuffy after burning, you must immediately open the door and windows, and never delay or ignore it.</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, airplanes had been invented for not long. When pilots could talk to ground stations by using wireless microphones at three thousand feet above the ground, common people were already extraordinarily amazed. Now, however, airplanes can set up radio-wave-broadcasting cinemas. When they're flying, they can, on one hand, take pictures of the ground, and on the other hand, project those pictures back to the ground. The shooting range can reach up to thirty miles. People on the ground who have receiving devices can have the chance to watch the pictures.</p>
<p>European and American countries are trying to test cloud-based broadcasting technology. Germany has had the best achievements. Experts think that the biggest challenge to putting a tele-cinema in the sky is: first, the radio-machine's area must be small enough for the plane to hold, but its transmitting power must be high; second, the illumination is an issue, because the high altitude doesn't have any strong light. The objective must be very clear when the shot is being taken. At around six thousand feet, one can only see an outline on the ground.</p>
<p>The success of cloud-based broadcasting has maximized the novelty and mobility in the entertaining aspects. Its effectiveness is even wider in practical application. Any unexpected huge change in any location, such as tsunami, earthquake, or volcano, can be transmitted. In the military, it can be the eyes and ears of the headquarters. It can report the range of shells. Commanders of the army don't have to go through the frontlines to survey the situation of the front army. They only need to send up a broadcast plane. After fifteen minutes, they can see everything on the silver screen. It is expected that in the future, after proactive development, one will be able to picture enemies from a hundred miles away, and make defensive and offensive strategies, and begin fourth-dimensional backstage activities.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Li Shimin's Lecture in Hong Kong - Chinese Actors in Hollywood <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Cui Ping, sent from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Many, but lacking skilled talents. Anna May Wong earns 1700 dollars per week</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shimin, a Chinese consultant at MGM in Hollywood, gave a speech at a reunion dinner held by the Hong Kong Youth Association after arriving in Hong Kong. The following is a record of the situation of our overseas Chinese in Hollywood. Mr. Li said: "Most of our overseas Chinese in Hollywood lack specialized talents, and they also lack actors who can be on camera and perform well. Secondly, they lack film talents who are popular in American society. For example, in the film "The Good Earth," it was very difficult to select Chinese roles. Sometimes, no less than 200 Chinese women would be selected, and some of them might have considerable beauty, but they lacked the talent for performance; or they had the talent for performance, but their appearance was not good. Therefore, none of the 200 people were selected in the end. There are more than 500 overseas Chinese working in the film industry in Hollywood, 75 of whom rely on being on camera to make a living. When "The Good Earth" was being filmed, more than 1,000 Chinese people were needed, so in addition to the 500 Chinese being fully employed, Americans and Mexicans were also used to play Chinese people. Hollywood pays Chinese extras 10+ dollars per day per person. If their performance and dialogue are required, it will increase to 25 to 50 dollars. Among the Chinese stars in Hollywood, Anna May Wong has the highest salary, earning 1,700 dollars per week. Next is the male actor Philip Ahn, who earns 800 dollars per week. Ahn is a veteran in the film city and has lived there for more than 20 years. Among Chinese technical talents, the photographer James Wong Howe is a source of pride for overseas Chinese and has become one of the top ten photographers in Hollywood (ranking sixth). He is currently in charge of the photography for the film "Young Mr. Lincoln," with a weekly salary of also one thousand plus dollars. In addition, there are many Chinese actors who are making rapid progress, such as Luke Chan (this gentleman has played the role of Chen Ziyi in several Charlie Chan detective films), Keye Luke, Richard Loo, Anna Lee and others, and so on.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford is doing well! The film fans will not forget her. See how carefully she is handling things. This "woman" is forever loyal to art.</p>

<p>— Yasen</p>
<p>Wang Xichun, a female performer in the Yifeng Troupe at the Carlton Theatre, has been hired for more than a year. Recently, she suddenly stopped performing due to a tongue disease. The reason is that during the seal box period last year, she went to a beauty doctor to have double eyelid surgery to seek beauty. Unexpectedly, not long after the spring performance, she suffered from a hoarse voice, and the medicine was ineffective. Later, after treatment by Dr. Gong Yuanbing, she recovered completely. However, half a month ago, on the night of Xichun's performance of Wu Song and Pan Jinlian, she suddenly suffered from a severely crooked tongue and headache. The next day, she asked for leave for treatment and was treated by Dr. Zeng Jingwu, a neurologist at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, and gradually recovered. However, the crooked tongue has not yet been corrected, and the Carlton's new play, Four Scholars, is about to be staged. She took leave in advance to play the role of Su'e. Unexpectedly, the headache recurred that night, and she was unable to perform again the next night. She asked the authorities for leave again, and the role of Su'e was temporarily replaced by Zhang Huicong. Currently, Xichun's mother believes that her daughter needs a long-term rest and cannot recover in a short time. It is not appropriate to ask for leave for a long time, so she sent a letter to Zhou Xinfang, the head of the Yifeng Troupe, to resign and return the contract money. Xinfang, considering the importance of the matter, handed over the letter and money to the front desk authorities for handling. There has been no news of a solution. If Xichun does quit, then in today's Shanghai, where there is a lack of female performers, the female pillar of Yifeng will become a problem.</p>

<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Tonight, the Shanghai amateur music community held a music convention at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Hall. Since Shanghai has called itself an "isolated island," I have been waiting with the greatest patience for the singing movement. I understand the "here and now" environment. Similarly, I also understand how active the singing groups are in various amateur organizations, becoming countless undercurrents. However, when I hear about how the singing movement in the mainland is in full swing, or when decadent music comes from the radio, I can't help but feel annoyed and inexplicably lament the silence of the isolated island's singing movement.</p>
<p>But I understand that the strategy of "here and now" is a resilient strategy, and the policy is to "resist forever," accumulating small victories into big victories, so we cannot easily give up even a little bit. As for fighting separately, everyone is "amateur," which is the truth. But what if we unite? What if we unite and have a plan and steps? If each group performs for fifteen minutes each week, seven groups can perform one show. If not, at least broadcast a special show once a week, which is always good.</p>
<p>However, since Shanghai became an "isolated island," there has never been such a broadcasting organization. Chen Gexin tried it on New News Radio, but it was later discontinued.</p>
<p>Now is the first joint music convention of the Shanghai amateur music community. For this reason alone, we should be extremely happy. The amateur music community of the isolated island can be united and has the spare power to "do something." But for this reason, I feel even more regretful for my past regrets and hope that the singing comrades in the future will correct this "regret." This is not impossible.</p>
<p>The indulgent atmosphere of the isolated island is becoming more and more fierce, and the same is true in the music community. How to eliminate this indulgent atmosphere is also one of the posts in the music community during this period.</p>
<p>"Hear the Rooster, Start Dancing." In this joint music convention, regardless of the audience, what are your thoughts as performers, the Shanghai amateur music community colleagues? What are your plans for the future?</p>

<h3 id="e122">Zhang Junxiang's Debut - Directing "Leading by Example" <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Junxiang, the first Chinese to study drama in the United States on a Boxer Indemnity scholarship, returned to China a few days ago. Mr. Zhang specialized in directing, stage management, and lighting. He spent more than four years, from 1935 to this fall, cultivating himself and has gained a wealth of experience. After returning to China, he was invited by the National Drama School in Chongqing to serve as a professor. When he passed through Shanghai, he was strongly invited by the person in charge of the Shanghai Drama Society to direct a play. The script is Li Jianwu's "Leading by Example." The content is satirical, humorous, and subtle. It was performed simultaneously in Beijing and Shanghai a few years ago, causing a sensation. This time, Mr. Zhang Junxiang is directing, and the author, Li Jianwu, will also participate in the performance, playing the role of Xu Shouqing in the play. Other actors include Lan Lan, Xia Feng, and others. It is said that the play has been decided to be staged at the Xuan Palace Theater after "The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty."</p>
<p>The Mingshe box office will be held on the 23rd and 24th at the Carlton Theatre for rehearsals. "The first day's daytime show includes Golden Stage Full, Colorful Building Matching, Single Plank Bridge Pass, The Three Halls Joint Trial, Yellow Crane Tower, and The Complete Series of Chain Traps." The second day's daytime show includes Lifting the Tripod to View the Painting, Yue Family Village, June Snow, Chasing Han Xin, Universe Edge, and The Complete Series of Empty City Tactics." The performers in each play for both days are well-known figures in the ticket industry. In particular, the Three Halls Joint Trial on the first day is starring movie star Ning Xuan, who will surely show her artistic talent. The grand occasion at the appointed time is bound to be as expected.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>One Imperial Performer Remaining in the North and South Respectively</p>
<p>In recent years, old performers have been gradually declining. Among the famous surviving performers from the Qing Dynasty who once served in the imperial court, only Rui Debao remains among the male roles, and only Wang Yaoqing remains in the female roles. People such as Cheng Jixian, Wang Fengqing, and Shang Heyu either did not enjoy the same fame as Rui and Wang in their early years, or they did not serve in the imperial court. Moreover, both Rui and Wang spent their later years teaching students, with countless disciples in and out of the profession. This is another similar situation. When Yaoqing accompanied Yuyong south, I was planning to invite the old friends of the National Drama Research Association to a dinner party to invite the two elders to dine together and take photos to commemorate them. This is also a good story in the Pear Garden. Wang and the Four Famous Female Roles (except for Yanqiu, who had performed the disciple etiquette) all had a relationship of half-teacher and half-friend. As for the female performers such as Xin Yanqiu, Zhang Eyun, Du Liyun, and the newly famous Wang Yuyong and Song Dezhu, they all came from her school. As for Rui Debao's proud disciples, there are also Yang Ruiting, Wang Qingchen, and Bai Yukun. What makes people feel even more coincidental is that the two both belonged to Lao Tan's most proud supporting roles in his prime. The two are indeed quite knowledgeable, all of which they have gained from the direct transmission of famous teachers. However, if there had been no help from Tan's encouragement and promotion at that time, it seems that they would not have received much social attention and welcome either. Because Tan's selection of supporting roles was very strict, and those who were not to his liking, even if they were already famous performers, would find it difficult to be selected. After Debao left Beijing, Xiaolou often performed with Lao Tan. It is said that when he was dying, Yaoqing and Xiaolou went to his bedside to visit him. Tan gave a farewell message, saying, "You two have performed with me for a long time, and you have always been able to follow the rules and listen to my instructions. If you can continue to improve in the future, it will not be difficult to bring glory to your ancestors." (146)</p>
