<p>社評</p>
<h3>改進國內貿易的急要</h3>
<p>中國的國內貿易，自抗戰以來，因為國外貿易遭受海上交通封鎖的關係，同樣為政府所重視。據最近報載，各省的省際貿易，經過政府的規劃和各省地方當局的推進，比較從前已有相當進步；尤其閩浙贛粵各省間的省際貿易，更是特別來得繁榮。但就目前整個中國的情形看來，現在所有的國內貿易，似乎尙不能滿足環境的需要，還待政府和人民努力以謀發展。</p>
<p>在平常時候，國內人民的生產與消費，本就需要國內貿易的協調；在戰爭時期內，這種協調工作的需要，更是非常迫切。現在中國的政府，為着支持長期抗戰起見，正在內地積極從事礦業的開發，工業的建設，和農業的改革，這種種的事業，固然是需要科學的技術，同時却也需要原料和市傷；而原料的取得和市傷的開拓，也就必須要有很發達的國內貿易。中國要建設戰時經濟的基礎，發展國內貿易自是她的重要工作之一。</p>
<p>並且在目前政府所實施的對外貿易統制政策下，也急需國內貿易的輔助：被政府禁止進口的商品，其中確有很多是能在國內大量生產的，但因國內貿易的不發達，有些地方在需要上還是得不到國內的供給，如米糧為中國主要農產物，去年又是豐收，可是閩省在洋米限制進口令下，依舊發生食糧不夠的現象；至於被政府禁止出口的商品，由於銷路的阻塞，更容易影響到一般人民的生計。最近中國政府認上海為日人暴力控制區域，禁止棉花桐油等五十四種土貨運銷上海，致浙東閩南各口岸的各種土貨都有堆積，商民也因此而遭受相當的損失。若是中國國內貿易發達，閩省所缺的米可以在湘贛等處取得供給，浙東的土貨，也不難運銷西南鄰近各省，或逕由政府在上述各地收買而轉銷國外，是以中國政府為發揚對外貿易統制的效力起見，也以從速發展國內貿易為宜。</p>
<p>便就日本武力控制的區域來說：自戰區逐漸擴大之後，日本經濟上的重荷，本身已不能負擔，現正利用着廣大的佔領區域，一方面搜括各種的農鑛等生產物，一方面則極力造成日貨獨佔的市塲，最近長江流域的食米，被日本裝載而去的在百萬担以上，去年華北棉花輸往日本的，値一萬萬元，中國政府要打破日本這種和武力並進的經濟侵掠行動，最有效的辦法，也祗有設法發展國內貿易，使華軍遊擊區域內的一切生產原料，不經日人之手，完全運銷內地；而遊擊區域內人民所需要的必需物品，也由內地酌予供給。現在日本在佔領區域內所能控制的地方，祗是一些較大的城市，她的經濟活動，也决不敢離開城市一步，城市以外的貨物交易，大都是利用着少數不肯華人。中國政府祗要設法對於遊擊區域城市的商業加以封鎖，則日本所佔領地方的經濟活動，仍可以完全由中國政府控制，那末，廣大遊擊區域內的豐富物資，不僅不會資敵，反更足以加强政府抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>就上述幾點看來，足見發展中國的國內貿易，確是非常急要。不過要發展國內貿易，首先就得發展國內的交通，這層在現時自是較為困難，但現時政府却也正在努力進行，並且已有很好的成績表現。此外為使國內貿易發展迅速起見，最好也由中央政府組織一個調整國內貿易的機關，專門担任計劃調查指導並實際經營發展國內貿易的工作；同時各省地方當局，對於省際貿易，更應遵守中央法令，特別予以便利。在戰事時期。多數的交易，在手續上此較麻煩，最好是採取以貨易貨的方法。譬如現時閩省以閩鹽交換贛米，將來粵省也儘可以粵鹽交換湘米，川省也儘可以全省無數豐富的物產，以與西北各省交換皮貨牲畜，西南各省交換五金雜貨。推而廣之，不僅促進國內貿易的發達，調劑各地供求的不平，並且對於軍事上，因為物質流通運行的圓滑，社會生活秩序的安定繁榮，更足以樹立堅强抗戰的經濟基礎，所以國內貿易的改進，的確是今日刻不容緩的要圖！</p>

<p>據八日法文上海日報載、據東京電訊、日內務省近忽發出通令、嚴飭全國警察機關、注意中國間諜之活動、聞該省令內容、曾述有若干日人受中國方面收買、假名入各兵工廠、探取情報、並謂此事已獲有相當綫索、爰飭各警察切實嚴防「日奸」、</p>
<h3>日艦砲轟後他去　定海秩序恢復　衜頭及東郊受損較重　甬定間交通已行恢復</h3>
<p>定海於本月五日又發生日艦向岸開砲事件、惟損毀尙輕、本埠定籍商號、已得此事之詳細報吿、茲探錄如次、</p>
<p>定海現狀</p>
<p>定海自發生「一二」事變、駐定水警與客軍（川沙游舉隊）衝突、幸經官紳調停、化險為夷、秩序已全恢復、惟近來自滬輸禁止駛定、該縣商市、已非前時之比、急景凋年、情况黯淡</p>
<p>日艦闖入</p>
<p>詎本月五日中午十二時、突有日艦三艘（屬第四號艦隊）闖入竹山門（即定海口子）、駛至衜頭江心停泊、即行放下小汽艇一艘、向岸駛來、圖勒扣繫泊於衜頭邊之各種帆船、</p>
<p>日夜發砲</p>
<p>各帆船睹狀、紛紛四向逃避、致該日汽艇一無所獲、竟向各帆船用機檜射擊後、仍行駛回日艦、其時三日艦中之為頭一艘、斷續向岸發砲二十餘發、入晚又開砲廿餘發、至次晨十時、日艦始離去、</p>
<p>捐害調查</p>
<p>事後調查、衜頭附近一帶、中彈頗多、如同壽泰醬園、陽春館小吃店、均全燬、當日艦駛泊江心時、銜頭居民及店夥、均逃避一空、故死傷祗一小販（已斃命）、又縣城東郊之東嶽宮、亦中砲彈全燬、無死傷、</p>
<p>利寶被搜</p>
<p>往來定海寗渡間之利寶輸、於六日上午七時離定開甬、其時日艦尙泊江心、即被攔扣、由日海軍六人、登輪檢查一過、因無所獲、仍得放行、至甬定交通、現已照常、秩序全復云、</p>
<p>電吿安謐</p>
<p>此事發生後、定海旅滬同鄕會、極為關念、即經去電詢問、昨日已山無綫電得復、據吿日艦即於六日中午離定、縣城秩序、即日恢復、寗定間交通、仍山利寳輪行駛、天寳則早經改駛沈（家門）定綫、請釋念等語、</p>
<p>揣測原因</p>
<p>又據旅滬定籍紳商方面表示、此次日艦突向定海開砲、其原因有二、緣其目的圖攫奪舟山羣烏魚利已久、而該地漁民、則均抱不合作精神、此其一、最近有川沙方面作戰之遊擊隊過定、地方當道、熱烈予以招待、此亦為某方不滿、遂出此威嚇而無聊之舉動、</p>
<p>魚產待運</p>
<p>另悉、定海因魚產儲積、亟待向滬推銷、經定海魚商、向寗波防守部郭司令請求、派海福·哈納·高登·等三輪運輸、茲悉防守部祇允一輪運輸、並須向　某集團軍司令劉長官核准後、始克實行、</p>
<h3>英商新北京輪　改駛滬甬　定十五日　首航寗波</h3>
<p>英商太古輪船公司行駛於滬甬綫最大之商論新北京號、自八一三滬戰爆發後、因航路梗阻、該輪即改行開駛華北、茲悉浙江省當局、已核定各輸駛甬、准直入寗波、故該公司業己將新北京號、仍復調回行駛滬甬綫、現已定於本月十五日起、首次恢復直航奪波、</p>
<h3>各地游擊隊　聲勢日益浩大　鄧部在望亭痛殲日軍　南通偽軍多反正投誠</h3>
<p>望亭</p>
<p>担任江南京滬綫之游擊司令鄧本殷部、約有四五千人、散處於蘇州·無錫·常州·之間、四出活躍、襲擊日軍、該部第三特務大隊楊祥棨部數百人、於二月六日在蘇州望亭大墻鬥與日軍激戰、達四五小時之久、楊部以事前兵力配備週密、引誘日軍陷入重圍、即加予痛殲、前後左右、四面夾擊、日軍陣容大亂、東竄西逃、突國衝出、結果在華軍密集機關槍下、死傷二十餘人、餘均逃回望亭站、嗣後日援軍趕到營救、而華軍任務已達、安然引退、</p>
<p>南通</p>
<p>蘇北遊擊隊、業經×虎區司令顧祝同、重行改編後、並調遣正規部隊參與、聲　日益浩大、昨據南通來人談、日前有日偽軍三百人、從南通城出發、在四鄕紛擾、各村人民、懼其淫威、紛粉避難、詎該日偽軍抵達金沙鎭時、被華軍出　不意、予以襲擊、附近各鎭市　隊、亦據報開往應援、進行　攻、日偽寡不敵衆、棄槍逃遁、未及逃出市鎭者之日軍三名被據、且有一部份偽軍、反正投誠、並高呼「驅逐日軍」「中華民國萬歲」「蔣委員長萬歲」等口號、</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>怎樣來完成夫婦的愛情</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>要防夫婦愛的破綻，使家庭生活得享幸福，那對於生殖機能是要十分注意的，這個要點，就是要使婚後生活得到十分快樂，並且使雙方的滿足能夠永久繼續下去就得。這個在結婚前當然需要豫備知識，而在結婚後最要緊的，就是生殖的衛生。</p>
<p>古人對於沉溺荒淫的人，曾經楊了許多方法，來加以道德或理智的節制·簡單說起來，就是所謂「婚後衛生」因爲要使人們能營健全的生殖和不老長生的幸福，給與了一種男女婚後的模範。</p>
<p>過度的縱慾在男子方面，和女子方面，都是有害的。女子易犯心悸亢進，子宮充血和內膜火等病，日後就成了不妊的原因。男子最易陷於性的神經衰弱；如遺精，腎虧，陰痿等症，立在活動社會裏面，不夠奮鬥。</p>
<p>生殖既是人生的一個大事實，又是形成我們日常生活一部分的東西，所以要充分健全，因爲它確是「家庭的幸福」和「夫婦愛」的基礎。幸福的家庭生活，是人生最大幸福之一。家庭內的空氣，應該是精神的，靈的，但是牠的基礎的生殖問題，卻應該立腳在生物學或科學的事實上面。</p>
<p>要完成夫婦的愛情，當然要先剷除有礙生殖工作的腎虧與陰痿。倘聽其自然，不僅夫婦之愛無從實現，而其病態會延及全身，如面色蒼白，肌肉削疲，頭腦脹痛，精神萎靡，健忘失眠，故從早治療，實爲必要之步驟，現在的醫學已發明內分泌療法可使該症澈底根治，如積極服以雄壯動物睾丸內分泌製劑男用「補體康」能使早洩，陰痿迅速消滅，性辦健全，決無短促現象，同時使腦力振作，新陳瓦謝的機能促進，肌肉壯茁，面色紅潤，該劑藥力週到，廿四小時即能生精補腎，是故功效爲一切內分泌藥劑之冠，其女用補體康爲眞正卵巢製劑有調經種子之功</p>
<h3>肺病的良藥</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>癆病固人人所怕者，但在未成癆病之前，則人人示有不疏忽者，咳嗽之疾，最易俏人所略，殊不知多爲肺癆病之前驅。若欲防癆，必先治咳，而治咳與防癆最足靠之療法，以余二十七八年來之經騐，首推德國「補肺拿爾」爲最，不論由於何種原因之咳嗽，氣喘不安枕席，服「補肺拿爾」三小時內即可止咳，絕對不致變爲肺癆，其已入肺癆各期中者，服此劑亦能短期治愈。</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>因白洵而致腎虧</p>
<p>爲何影響腎臟之症　白洵爲何影響腎臟？腎臟不是與外生殖器相距甚遠乎？此無他，不識淋菌逃竄之本領，及與外生殖器溝通之道。原來吾人之腎臟有輸尿管通於膀胱，所以如有發生膀胱火。或輸尿管火，十九有發生淋毒性腎臟炎，腎盂火之可能。所以對於淋病之治療方法，不可不竭力注意，偶一不愼，即有使腎臟虧弱，以致釀成嚴重之後果。因此，吾人凡對已患淋毒性之膀胱炎者，必須防止其續發輸尿管炎，因爲一成此種續症，其生殖之前途，受到非常可怕的威脅，同時腎臟排泄工作，亦頓形紊亂，這是一般醫家所不注意的事。</p>
<p>怎樣免避此種危機　怎樣可以免避此種危機，則如能免除膀胱炎，則腎臟炎之症，自不致續發。所謂明者防患於未然。而患者在未成膀胱炎時，必須用敏捷的手術，對症之特效藥，加以徹底之治療。始能安全地治愈。據我以二十年來之經騐，關於淋毒性膀胱炎，輸尿管炎，腎臟炎等症先以德國靜電療法及X線電療法等，交互爲用，更以淋病聖藥「克淋儂」作爲內服藥，一則內服藥可以使患者體內發生抗淋噬菌作用，一則靜電療法，可以透射淋菌，相輔爲用，相得益彰。則因淋病而致腎虧之症，自可迅速獲愈　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角</p>
<p>現代醫學</p>
<h3>白濁豈不能根治嗎？</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>白洵不能根治是十足欺人之談！　謂能在三五天內治愈更是欺人！</p>
<p>淋病眞不能根治嗎？其實是可根治的，淋病的根治，須從剷除其根本的原因做起，始可達到目的。所以治療愈快，所得利益亦愈大，而根治亦愈速。如果遷延時日，病毒日深，安能於最短期內，望其根？不過此語言淋病之難於短期根治而已。並不說其必不可根治也。惟余恒見一般淋病患者，以其病之不能一時獲效，乃不免頻露焦窘之念，而一般市上成藥，乃投其所好，謂某種成藥，一定可以在三五天之內，可以完全斷根，於是淋病患者，祗擇目的，不擇手段，爭相服用，結果每不能得到預期之目的而招失望。或者較未病前爲尤劇。此蓋不知淋病之眞相，所以才鑄成這樣的錯誤。因爲天下根本沒有那種神話上所說之淋病內服藥。要淋病根治，是可以的，要淋病短期內治愈，也是可以的。但必須要記到，一切療法，必須合於科學方法，才可以奏效，否則絕對不能有何效果。此是我多年來實騐所得之經過</p>
<p>以我實騐，最符合吾人理想的目的者，以德國淋病學家彼德博士發明之淋病聖藥「克淋儂」一藥爲最。因此劑係博士畢生心血之結晶，採用蛋白體黃色素混合製成，經過千百次之實際試騐改良，及分發各國著名花柳病醫院試騐，逐步改良，以至盡善盡美，與彼粗製濫造之市上成藥所宣稱，今年爲最新淋藥，明年又以舊年之新藥爲落伍者大不相同，蓋一般新藥毫無標準，而「克淋儂」則歷久彌新，一切新舊白濁，非「克淋儂」一藥，決難望其根治，並且服「克淋儂」可以在三五星期中澈底根治。此是最短期根治淋病的合理辦法。</p>
<h3>遺精不能盲目治療</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>當青年在發育時代，受體內荷爾蒙HORMONE之天然刺激，遂有性的衝動，意志薄弱者，輒不克自制，遂致犯上自凟，蓋自凟之後，每易流爲習慣，於是青春腺過度興奮，性神經衰弱症因而爆發，如遺精，早洩，陰痿，發育不全等，且遺精過久之後，腦力衰退，其人必感覺頭痛，健忘，耳鳴，失眠，對精神事業，亦無力操作，感情劇變，喜怒無常，如症狀嚴重，常抱消極態度，而啓發自殺之動機。</p>
<p>本症除由自凟縱慾而來之外，若身心過度衰勞，如日夜勞瘁心思的事情或作自己能力以上的事務，或擔任一種過重的責任，及作牠距離的步行，都可以招致這個病徵。</p>
<p>關於遺精的治法，第一必須戒絕手淫，尤其不可盲目治療，投以德國治療專藥，「耐而斯遺精片」最爲對對症。他若神經衰弱，性力斷虧，須較以　　　　製劑「補體康」服之即愈</p>
<h3>肺病治愈關鍵</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺臟爲一無知覺之臟器，故其爲癆菌侵入，毫不知覺，雖侵蝕成爲空洞，這次無特異痛苦，惟癆菌犯及肋膜發生肋膜炎，則有胸部刺痛之感，或則因肋膜炎而至胸腔蓄水，或則因結核腦膜炎而斃命，故治愈肺癆之關鍵，一方固在增加抵抗力，而主要方面，尤以應服德國徒梅博士所發明肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，以增生肺部石灰質，殺滅癆菌，由是則肺病無論至何期，亦得根本全治。因此「補肺拿爾」得能風行於各國，實非偶然之事也。</p>

<p>多年情誼　暫免起租、以昭公允、旋於本月十一日、接准貴行十日來函、內稱、仁智里一帶房屋、除永安銀公司舊址對面市房、因日軍司令部限制不許華人營業外、其仁智里住宅房屋、無論任何國籍市民、已可安然居住、若貴房客對該屋可使用而故意不使用、且拒付租金、將使本行房屋、久久懸擱、不能收租、坐受損失云云、查仁智里一帶地點、尚在日軍</p>
<p>封鎖綫內　歷經工部局交涉、未允開放、人所共知、交通阻斷、往來尚不得自由、遑論安然居住、至其中間、有向日軍領得返居證而遷回居住者、但無法領得此項返居證者、舖居最大多數、總之工部局警權、一日未復、居民即一日無保障、無保障、即點不能安居、來函謂、房客等對該屋可使用而故意不使用、實屬</p>

<p>將來開放　可照常營業時、仍須保留與舊房客、以免糾紛、以上辦法、節經敝房客等多次集議、意見相同、於情理亦屬允洽、用特函達、即請轉陳貴行主查照、予以施行、則銘感高情、永無紀極、</p>

<p>唐贖身後內幕明瞭　唐文源被綁後、亦被帶至不明所在之機關內、即有若干匪首、男女均有、唐一見多爲相熟者、彼等自稱係僞「警」出身、雖因被革失業、迫於生計、度此非人生活、但抱定宗旨、專綁漢奸、不綁他人、以示愛國不敢後人、並命唐識相些、連繳一個月僞薪贖身、按唐爲福建人、年已五十餘歲、髪斑白、係蘇錫文在浦東開張僞「大道市府」第一批登台之小傀儡、家住公共租界愛文義路、目下僞薪每月一百八十元、當時唐老淚縱橫、哀求減價、匪等先在其身畔搜出十餘元、並將其大衣卸下、派匪進入租界典質、僅得三十元、離百八十元之數甚鉅、乃將唐僞職員語與僞「通行證」扣留、將唐放回後、唐越三小時、湊集七十元往贖、並苦苦懇求、表示無法湊滿一月僞薪、匪等允之、將僞件交還、唐狼狽而出、</p>
<p>僞員恐懼化裝出入　自僞府二個僞員被綁案發生後、傅筱庵以下僞「局長」僞「秘書」僞「科長」僞「科員」僞「辦事員」等大小傀儡、深恐日後逢到同樣遭遇、莫不惴惴自然、在僞「府」來往途中、均鬼鬼祟祟、不敢再如往日之拋頭露面、一部份僞員、且異想天開、從事化裝、以避匪徒目標、原穿西裝者、改穿中裝、原穿中裝者、則改西裝、未戴眼鏡者、加戴眼鏡、一般患近社者、反除去眼鏡而行、有鬍鬚者剃去、年輕之青年、反留短鬚、笑話百出、狼狽異常、</p>
<h3>逃難時車夫起歹心竊取主人財物　巨額現鈔首飾埋藏鄉間家內　夫婦逃難來滬主人撞見拘獲</h3>
<p>松江東門外世代女科名醫唐少遇、現年八十歲、在鄉間行醫、頗有資產、於前年戰事發生、國軍西移、松江將淪陷之前、唐將家中所有細軟箱籠整理後、偕眷屬等僱祥生汽車裝載避難來滬、寓法租界霞飛路呂斑竹路口五鳳里十一號、當在松江臨行時、因祥生汽車</p>
<p>車廂狹小　、所有箱範不能盡行裝入、剩下皮箱一只、與手提皮箱一只、交其家中所僱之包車夫楓涇人朱金福（今年廿六歲）、暫行看守保管、囑其待汽車到滬後、再返松江接彼、並裝皮箱來滬、皮箱內儲藏價值四千金之金珠首飾、手提皮箱內所藏係現鈔六千元、詎朱於唐等</p>
<p>全家離松　後、竟私行開啟皮箱及手提箱檢視、見箱內盡是現銷黃白物、不禁大喜、頓起歹念、遂攜兩箱潛逃、迨主人派汽車再度赴松接朱與皮箱、已人去屋空、無法找尋、祗得空車返滬、徒喚奈何、而朱攜兩箱逕歸楓涇家內將大部份之飾物與現鈔</p>
<p>埋藏家內　地下、偕妻攜帶少數飾物現鈔來滬、賃居於法租界錢家塘六十四號亭子間內、夫妻二人、度其舒適生活、至前日朱金福行經霞飛路呂班路口五鳳里門前、不料天綱恢恢、被主人唐少遇之親戚撞見、奔告唐家、派人趕出、鳴捕、</p>
<p>將失追獲　帶至捕房、由被害人事主唐少遇據情報告朱金福侵佔持有之他人所有物、請求讀究、據朱供認不諱、尚有餘贓埋藏鄉間家中地下、捕房著銃收押、昨日解送特二法院刑八庭、請求改期、偵查再訊、經朱楚哲推事向被告訊問一過、諭知改期十五日再訊、被告還押、</p>

<p>大砲機件　損壞、由贛押運來滬修理、從滸浦裝德商某輪船、將於本日抵滬、特歸若廠承修、王聞其言、當派司賬王蔭庭、偕往外灘輪船碼頭審察損壞程度、俾定修理工價、並因該王笑湖謂尚欠輪船運費七十元、須暫墊付、故復以款交給蔭庭、</p>
<p>隨同前去　嗣在該碼頭候至傍晚始見船到、笑湖遂向蔭庭索取款項、逕自登船、蔭庭則尾隨至船內、躑躅良久、並無損壞大砲機件、船中職員、亦無一與之相識者、結果蔭庭仍隨之登陸、且覺笑湖行跡可疑、立即鳴由崗捕拘入該管捕房、抄出全部原資、昨解第一特區地方法院、由孟庭柯推事提審、捕房律師錢恂九當將被告、</p>
<p>揑詞欺騙　之經過事實、陳述一過、請求懲治、質之被告王笑湖、依然供係奉命押運損毀機件來滬修理、並稱彼係喬裝老百姓前來、故無任何證明文件、而對於船內機器、何以未見一點、則一味支吾、孟推事核供、以該犯顯係揑名撞騙、判處徒刑三月、原賊法幣七十元、發還原主領去、</p>

<h3>證券　英德續債橫跳鎊半　內債市塲結束有期</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況盤旋升降閃爍不定、多空雙方、供求籌碼、憂並不踴躍、而市價於飄忽中、仍帶疲象、人心之閑散、市氣之浮沉、由於廢歷年關已屆、各業大都結束、無意經營者半、由於環境之沉悶而毫無刺激性新消息者亦半（聞交易所暗盤交易已有規定、年內做至下週二爲止）（即廢歷十二月二十六日）、迨廢歷明年初五紅盤開市、因此大戶均已縮手、祗零星散戶點綴市塲而已、</p>
<p>昨日經過、買方賣方均無重大意義、時而買進者多、則價略升、時而賣出者多、則價略降、升降浮沉、捉摸不定、開市爲三十五　號及潤利號以及二十二號、先後拋賣或出籠、市價隨之下降五六角、樂茂號及十一號忽乘低買進、信豐永又見機補空、乃回上二三角、收盤午後市面較爲穩定、而交易則益形減少、初因天生號及十一號續有買進而堅、繼以恒德及大豐號　略有供給而疲、全日盤旋結果、略小五分一角至三角半、成交總數共計約四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙鬆動　現金價突轉下游</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、突又轉疲、蓋外滙受港電暨西商等猛塞下、逐步鬆硬、且英純金亦連降三日、故各方人心頓形疲囫、雖金號暨北幫等購買、但爲數有限、致價遂由高逐漸趨低、已逼近二千〇四十元關口、交易因大戶觀望不前、故亦較清、銀樓飾金則連跌二元、海關金未更、中英純金等再度下降、</p>
<p>烚赤暗盤跌十一元</p>
<p>自晨每條十兩、初開因聞外滙受港電猛塞下、頓見鬆硬、故買戶多觀望不前、致雙方擯持至十時許、始見銀樓幫售予錢兌業五十兩、二千〇五十一元爲開盤價、較上日做低六元、開後相同價又見現金號售予錢兌業四十兩、繼之北幫忽來吸購、進銀樓幫五十兩、價五十二元、後金號互做五十兩、價則相同、此後買戶較少、價即向下挫、銀樓幫售予錢兌業五十兩、及售予金號五十兩、價均五十元、後金號又吸收錢兌業百兩、價四十九元、時已十時三刻、此後供求轉稀、直至午時雯未見做開、故午收價作爲四十九元、午後因外滙無市、故初開頗形平靜、迨至二時一刻後、某錢兌業忽代客幫多頭出籠、價遂由四十八九元喊低至四十六元、方見做開、售予同業五十兩、價四十六元、時已二時半許、此後買戶更形缺乏、且其時售者反多、致價遂又逐步喊低至四十元、然仍雖獲對手、逾刻許後、忽有人來吸購、但售者其時已不肯廉賣、致未做開、故晚收價仍爲二千〇四十六元、較上日軋跌十一元、全天六元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇五十五元、收進二千〇四十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金兩次掛小</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時半光景、因烚赤潛勢甚疲、故乃掛小一元、後又至下午四時半、因烚赤更形疲軟、故而再掛小一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百〇七元、新同行亦改懸二百〇五元、收進一百九十九元、</p>
<p>英鎊日高純金續跌</p>
<p>七日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊日見高昂、故又引起多戶脫售、致每盎司又續跌一辨士半、計退達七鎊八先令四辨士、中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦隨降至一千二百十元〇九角、掛牌海關金則未更改、計仍爲二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦疲落一元、計一千二百〇六元二角、</p>
<h3>港方仍予維持匯市人心復見安定　西商沙遜賣意亦濃　美金重出十六元關</h3>
<p>滙市自前日轉趨盤旋局勢後、並聞滙豐願以英金八辨士一二五爲儘量售出維持價、是以人心驟見安定、而昨更以港電暨本市西商沙遜等一再競塞、致趨勢鬆濫、雖中途洋行及外商銀行曾來購結、但以頭寸依然懸殊、故而潛勢仍見步硬、當天成交尚旺、港匯因錢兌業拋售頗殷、且各外銀行納胃不健、故市況亦稍回鬆、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均長、紐約現貨依然不動、倫敦生金再縮一辦士半、滙兌英對美大四釐四、對法小三生丁、對滬降〇六二五、美對英、對法均升〇六二五、對滬漲四分、中央掛牌、各滙呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價、英滙八辦士一四〇六二五、美滙十五元九〇六二五、較前收均平、開後港電突來拋塞、首先售予外銀行英金八辦士一七一八七五及一八七五、繼之又售予滙豐英金八辦士二〇三一二五、故爲狀步硬、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉升二五、計徵百分之五·五、此後外銀行暨洋行等雖扒、但西南沙遜賣意陡濃、且港電續來拋售、故狀況終於步硬、港電與西商沙遜相繼賣予美行華比外銀行等美滙十五元九三七五長至十六元、俄而外銀行亦來復出、麥加利荷蘭美行有利聯袂售予洋行英金八辦士二〇三一二五、及美滙十六元、加以錢兌業亦售予安達荷蘭港滙五十四元半及七五、於是趨勢仍鬆、延至午收銀行賣價英滙八辦士二〇三一二五、美匯十六元〇三一二五、結果較前收英長〇六二五、美硬一二五、港滙亦賤三七五、午後週三無市、</p>
<h3>外幣出籠回小</h3>
<p>昨日英純金續跌一辦士半、英美滙兌續升零六二五、外匯結款未旺。港電猶太幫等供給甚暢、市價漸形鬆動、趨勢堅硬、嗣外滙鬆動、多方紛起出籠、供給驟旺、雖津幫吸收未懈、終以出籠者衆、頭寸寬裕、市價逐步下跌、勢甚軟弱、此連日高漲之反動也、外幣隨匯市鬆動、現金衰弱、收藏者出籠驟殷、市價急趨下降、交易旺盛、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金鎊降三角、英金票降三角一分、美金鎊降三角、美金票降六分八厘、香港票降一分二厘、法郎票降一厘、新加坡票降二分、荷蘭票降三分、羅比票降二分、坎拿大票降五分、斐律票降四分半、澳金票降四角、僅安南票義大利票德金票暹邏票未更、</p>
<h3>大條近遠俱長</h3>
<p>七日倫敦電、銀市投機家少數買過、及有人來補空、缺少供給、市面尚平、收盤後繼續平定、大條銀近遠期俱長〇六二五、又紐約電、美銀價依然呆定如故、孟買因休業無電、</p>

<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、稍見回上、但差數仍微、每千元價仍盤於三十五元左右、最後價爲三十五元、比前日回高二角半云、</p>
<h3>糧食　麵粉大批　分運南北　市面平穩</h3>
<p>昨粉市趨勢、尚稱平衡、連日客銷零星、成交日僅二三萬包、在此洋麥湧到聲中、人心未免看疲、但廠方依然堅持原盤、並未受其影響、蓋由於各廠存料稀薄、據說最近天津幫正式交易、雖未暢動、而前次被華北方面某大戶購去之粉、裝出數量、已屬不少、更值年關期近、洋麥雖到、一時亦無從出粉、故市面尚堪支撐、統市南洋幫及本街成交各有八千餘包、北洋幫去化亦不足萬包、二號粉仍須四元八角、四號粉紅財神喊價反昂、聞須四元三角、但無成議、</p>
<p>昨有粉三百包運寗波、今日出口則有二萬七千八百包運福州、二萬六千八百包運廈門、七千八百包運天津、二千五百包運威海衛、</p>
<p>又今日又有七百包麩皮運往廈門、</p>
<h3>麥市蕭條如故　運甬一千七百包</h3>
<p>昨小麥來源、續見寥落、緣年關日近、行商多已停止辦運、且產價高昂、貨方莫不堅持、而廠方仍以洋麥有到、進胃不佳、即使放價、亦無多量可辦、故市面蕭條如故、阜豐廠賡續停辦、福新廠僅開江北小麥一種、額僅三百包、價仍爲六元六角、市面沉寂、</p>
<p>昨有麥子一千七百八十包運寗波、</p>
<h3>總結束期漸近米價日見昂騰</h3>
<p>昨日國米來源、共到河下二號、輪車包子二千餘包、又由滸浦來二千包、七丫來八百包、時將年終結束之期、各路貨源稀少、手有滬棧貨者、無抱過年心思、而本街銷塲及囤戶反當斯急進、致賣買雙方意相背弛、市形頓成供不應求之勢、市面混沌、喊聲亂起、一路直上、至收市結果、厚粳行情飛升二三角、薄稻因　戶觀望、僅零銷活動、漲勢較遜、僅增一角、杜洋尖埠尖亦提起一二角、　元以時令品更屬俏色、高貨已開十五、出口今日有一千三百包運廈門云、</p>
<h3>客秈成交三千包外　行市激漲</h3>
<p>昨客秈有囤戶吸收、本街各戶納胃尤濃、全日成交數增至三千包以上、高貨到存兩少、行情更爲扳俏、較之前市激漲角外至二角不等、南京大市高秈開十一元一二角、而特高貨已漲至十一元四角、囤戶所進之普通高蕪秈已大至十一元以外。邇日囤舖兩活、到頭不多、後市或須隨人心續昂云</p>
<h3>紗花　紗銷停滯市盤漸漸下挫</h3>
<p>紗市始進後退、趨勢稍有紊亂不一之狀、蓋市塲人心、大衆意見、對於明春必有興隆發達之象、故廠方雖有大量開出三四月期貨、一般商人尤爲歡迎、同時有經濟充裕者、對於外棧貨攙羅不絕、免得轉棧、手續既麻煩、且損毀覓相當空間棧房、殊感困難、足見囤藏者心意之堅强、早已準備作久擺之計劃也、現紗需要雖清、市價依然穩如磐石、昨實際客角僅一百七十二包、不過以歲臘關係、大都辦理結事賬情、因此停頓、須待明年新春再決方針矣、</p>
<p>現實銷不滿二百包</p>
<p>現紗市塲情形、晨開因客幫生意不動、相持甚久、而做開行情、承上日之氣、尚加五角、二十支雙雙價爲四百〇四元、老金城三百九十五元、此後聞現銷不來、大家多說無辦胃、市盤漸漸下挫、雙馬最後價爲四百〇一元半、天女棧單做至三百九十七元、結果查上午成交統計九百三十二包、行情二十支雙馬跌二元、天女跌五角、雙地球平、牧羊平、好做漲五元、特金城平、茲將各幫買去之客量錄左、</p>
<p>香港八〇同行七六〇寗波七汕頭六〇雲南二〇福建五合計九三</p>
<p>紗廠開紗繼續不懈</p>
<p>新裕紗廠開出二十支雙地球一千三百包、價爲四百元至〇一元、三四月期、承接者每包付定銀四分之三、定銀如此之鉅爲紗業有史以來之破天荒、新生廠再開出二十支金虎六百包、價仍做三百九十元、每包收定價三十元、祟信紗廠開出十支大發二百包、價爲三百元云、</p>
<p>日紗交易清淡如前</p>
<p>日紗市情生意既清淡如恒、各方皆無需要、售價無甚軒輊、二十支水月現紗價爲三百二十九元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十三元半、</p>
<p>出口紗有一千餘件</p>
<p>今有棉紗二百五十件運福州、又九十件運廈門、又三百三十件運香港、又十五件運廣州灣、又五十件運海門、又三百七十件運海防、又九十件運北海、</p>
<h3>紗廠補進原料　本棉去路又見活動</h3>
<p>本棉生意轉趨活潑。因各廠在最近期間、開出粗細棉紗爲額殊巨、對於原料當然補進。上海各棧底貨尤稀、經此交易、稍形起色、市盤即當前進矣、市上成交之數量、耳聞甚夥、但抄就之生意、僅五批、大概尚有許多、其中嚴守秘密、不願公開也、本日英商怡和廠納胃爲最健、計火機花一千包、其餘新生廠採辦亦不絕、然數量甚微、售價復見上挺、蘇北一路來源尚不惡、計通花到一千四百五十七包、又北沙來二百件、白茆來一百五十件、新港來七十件、出口有二百件運福州、茲將現棉成交之額量並市盤錄左、</p>
<p>美種花　七六·六〇　同業中進　一〇〇包　滙劃棧交</p>
<p>常陰沙　七四·〇〇　新生廠進　二七〇包　送廠老規</p>
<p>火機花　六六·〇〇　怡和廠進　一、〇〇〇包　現鈔送廠</p>

<p>通州花　（七八·六〇　七一·六〇）　又　二〇〇包　滙劃棧交</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市繼續呆滯異常、因羣衆均深信華盛頓方面貸款棉之出售問題、影響棉市前途殊甚也、故咸抱觀望態度、市價先因利物浦報小及一部份南方套賣而跌、後因國內廠商略有小額交易、較爲回漲、結果收盤時較前日跌三至六磅音、印度無市、預測不動、埃及跌十餘磅音、昨日滙兌仍無起色、折合法幣、棉價俱跌、美棉及巴西棉每擔跌五角、印棉跌三角、埃及棉跌三角半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、仍爲靜寂、各廠均因年關轉瞬即屆、交易已入停頓狀態、近日美棉到貨甚多、昨日有輪運來美棉萬餘包、現在在報關中、年前前尚可送廠交卸也、茲將昨日棉價分錄於後、</p>

<h3>疋頭　國布遠期貨開價均昂　東疋囤積仍熱烈　大宗布疋運閩粵</h3>
<p>國布因大結束期轉瞬將屆、客幫裝貨一致減少、各布市盤絕少變更、各廠遠期貨開價均昂、市氣頗堅、本街同業中頭寸寬裕者、對於市上廉宜現貨、購意頗濃、即府綢等期貨、同業中加賺頭互相轉讓、亦殊頻繁、客銷以華南較佳、粵幫辦山虎·寶貴·永豐·五鼠·各種牌細布·細斜八十餘包、本街購雜牌細斜、細布一百餘包、細斜係染色用途、而大鵬·孔雀等牌細布、乃應浙皖批發去路、白貨外如色布·漂白布·色斜·印花布浙贛內地亦購辦八百餘疋、蜀滇幫續辦色布·漂白帛·府綢·蔴紗·印花布三千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布客銷漸形退縮、惟本街同業之囤藏心思、益見濃厚、故昨細布·細斜現貨成交者有千件左右、售盤挺秀、每疋升漲二分半之譜、各洋行期貨開出續有四五百件、十二磅飛魚細布最高價做開十二元三角半、龍頭細布十二元二角、藍雙魚細斜十一元三角半、惟件額不多、</p>
<p>昨有一百七十五件運往寗波、今日出口、則運煙台八十件、運福州二百件、運廈門二十四件、運香港六十件、運廣州灣四十五件、運海口一百四十五件、運北海三百廿五件、</p>
<h3>絲茶　內用外銷　輯里絲重振旗鼓</h3>
<p>國外絲價，昨日再挺，紐約日絲八三分七五分，各激漲三分，上海絲B字漲四分，廣東絲漲六分。交易所行市則無甚上下。里昂日絲漲一法郎，上海絲一法郎至二法郎。廣東絲漲二·五〇法郎。橫濱早市現貨略滯，開九二七元，遠期九〇八元，計回跌十一元至十三元，但午後又復回上，現期重開九四〇元高盤。</p>
<p>本市交易，英法洋行，暫取觀望態度，印非絲銷，昨頗熱鬧，尤以輯里絲最爲俏利，計銀魚開出九七五元，蟒蛇八九〇元，均繼白廠經之後，突飛猛漲。下午持價八〇〇元則未曾售開。計印莊做開四〇擔。用戶絲市依然甚緊，RR白廠售開一五二五元，八一分白廠價一五六〇元，洋行望塵莫及。故市塲情形，不無價昂交清，而一般用戶及囤戶，以輯里經漲風初熾，頗多轉移其興趣點於此，故預測白廠經絲價，如洋行仍難展開，則漲風或將稍戢，而輯里經前途，因外銷與內用之競購，市價當尚有扶搖直上之可能云。</p>

<p>衣食住行周刋</p>
<h3>孤島四件事</h3>
<p>— 任一</p>
<p>上海變成了孤島之後，幾乎一切都在發生畸形的怪現象。照着戴季陶先生所解釋的三民主義，他把民生問題分做六大項：這自然是不够來包羅上海今日的全貌，至少還可以說一個大槪吧。</p>
<p>衣——上海的馬路，本來是服裝的展覽會，無論中西新舊，應有盡有。現在人口集中租界，花樣更形複雜。不過，有一種特殊的趨勢，因為許多公子哥兒，太太小姐，大批移居香港去，以致一切新奇服裝的派頭，已不是上海的道地貨，却是從香港來的舶來品了。</p>
<p>食——受着戰事的影響，也許不少的生意都有淸淡衰落的現象，祗有旅館，娛樂和吃的塲所，大見興隆，上自酒家飯店，不時開幕，旁及老大房，野荸薺之類，那分誰假誰眞？下至搭帳蓬的小吃處，遍地皆是。（指鬧街的僻地而言）但這麼多的地方，還沒有成千成萬的嗷嗷待哺的難民們的份兒！</p>
<p>住——烏籠式的弄堂生活，如今是更加擠得不堪了！自然，這是每一位二房東大發其財的機會，或者說，凡二房東大可以靠着租金生活了。比方一座以四十元代價租來的有衛生設備的房子，普通以三層計算，除了自己享用一層外，其餘兩層還可以租到一百元左右。這樣情形，莫怪一聞亭子間，都要住下三家或兩家了。</p>
<p>行——租界內的交通，原來是够發達了。戰後更闢了不少新的路綫，電車，公共汽車都加開班次，假期的日子，或上公下公的時候，總留下不少望車興嘆的搭客們。出了這兒，那儘是凄凉廢墟，悲壯戰蹟，要是沒有所謂「通行證」「良民證」的話，難免性命交關，眞是行不得也哥哥！</p>
<h3>裁衣的經驗</h3>
<p>— 坦白</p>
<p>成衣匠最怕的，就是主顧們算他，主顧們一算他，他就無從下手偷料了。所以製服裝者，對於裁衣的經騐，不可不曉得一二。靠此，便可舉以與成衣匠當面算定，則他無論如何的狡猾，也是難於下手的。</p>
<p>算的方法，譬如製一伴長袍，長需四尺，出手二尺二，以門面二尺二寸的綺霞緞製之，則需計長八尺一幅者二，三尺許一幅者一。假使穿它的是一個瘦小的人，下鈎不出一尺一寸，那麼它的闊，也不逾一尺一寸。所以可以把這塊布料來對剪，計綺霞緞八尺已足。再加袖料兩幅，三尺許的裏襟一幅，計衣料一丈一尺已足。把餘下來三尺許的布料，以直的長的小半作裹襟，大半作袖料。大約袖寬五寸，兩幅祇去二尺許，還有數寸方料可餘。至於衣袋及衣紐，可以用灣叉下的餘料作之。</p>
<p>上述的為小裁法，小裁法有一缺點，就是身段肥胖者，他的下鈎，如果過於一尺一寸的材料，那麼下面必須搭角。要免掉這種弊病，必需用大裁。大裁以原幅料裁剪，卽袖亦可以不接，但是只做一個人，必定要多費衣料幾尺，倘能二人合置，旣不耗費又能美觀。它的製法，假使袍長四尺者，須以一匹長一丈三尺至一丈四尺的布，（這必需照穿的人的抬肩及袖口的大小而定。）折而為三，上下兩幅各長四尺已足。因為中幅，須兩袖的一半的緣故。它的長度，須視抬肩的大小而定，如果抬肩需八寸者，則中幅長四尺八寸，加上上下兩幅各四尺，計需一丈二尺八。剪定了後，上下幅各有一幅多餘，這兩幅就可以用作小襟了。然而小襟一幅已經够了，那麼另一幅，就沒有用處；計所費的料，已經有二三尺。但是如果合置，兩人則可以不費，因為祗多中幅兩幅，上下兩幅所餘的料，便可作為兩人的小襟。</p>
<p>此外裁褂料，女料，也是一樣的，祗不過長短不同罷了。褲料則以自腰至脚管的長為兩幅，再加檔計算就是了。神而明之，决不會再受成衣匠欺騙</p>
<h3>一襲西裝的代價</h3>
<p>— 陸安之作</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期菜單中，曾以炒二冬一味貢獻於本刋讀者，說起冬菰這東西可以利用之處極多，除了與冬筍同炒，膾炙人口外，就是冬菰炒菜心也是一樣名貴的素菜，可以加入正式的筵席的。本星期我再來介紹一樣很別緻的菜，呌做肉餅嵌冬菰，做法很簡單，並沒有甚麼麻煩的手績，大家都可嘗試的。先照做肉圓的辦法，將猪肉切細，加上好醬油，搏成一個個肉圓，就揀取圓整的冬菰，每一個嵌一個肉圓在內，稍稍用指頭撳扁，變成肉餅的模樣，然後盛在碗中，放在飯鍋子上燉熟，那味見又香又鮮，可口得很。雖說這一樣菜有些貴族化，與本菜單招牌不合，但是每星期偶一為之，究竟比吃雞吃鴨便宜得多；只須筷下留情，不要像老饕般狼呑虎咽，那麼一碗二十個，也可以供一餐之需了。</p>

<h3>房屋的淸潔法</h3>
<p>小黑</p>
<p>一，木質的淸潔法</p>
<p>室內的木質柱壁和門窗，是最容易染上污垢的，如果我們時常去油漆它，不但所費很多，而且也感到十分麻煩，但是普通以淸水去洗滌，是不能完全使他回復舊觀的，如果我們拿苛性蘇打的溶液來洗滌，那却能收到意想不到的效果呢！至於怎樣來洗滌呢！那就是把苛性蘇打（藥房中均有出售）一份，溶解於一百份的水中，以掃帚取此液洗擦之，擦淸後復以淸水洗之，那就顯得十二分的淸潔了，但是在太污濁的塲合，我們要把水减少些變成苛性蘇打一份，溶解於五十份的水中，那麼隨便什麼污垢都能去除了，諸位讀者，這是很經濟簡便的方法，不妨試一試吧！</p>
<p>二，玻璃的揩拭法</p>
<p>玻璃窗和門上的塵埃是十分碍眼的，但是拭玻璃確是件麻煩的工作，尤其是在下雨以後，玻璃窗上附着許多水滴，更是難看，然而在下雨以後却是拭玻璃最適宜的時候，因為一方面可以省去拿濕布來揩拭，另一方面就不致使水點上黏着塵埃了。但是除此法以外，我們購買去垢粉塗於玻璃上，以後再以乾布拭之，也是很好的方法。</p>

<h3>西班牙的厄運</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>西班牙共和政府是否就此要覆亡，現在還不能作肯定的斷語。但是牠的大敗，以致引起了覆亡的危機，乃是不可掩的事實。</p>
<p>牠的大敗的原因，究竟在那裏呢？兵隊不及法則哥多麽？軍機不及法郎哥銳利麽？民治國的幫忙不及義大利的積極麽？不錯，這些都是使牠大敗的重要原因。然而假使牠沒有下列的一個原因，我相信牠是決不會大敗的，反之，還是可以大勝的。這惟一的原因，便是共和政府之下的各自治邦，各自爲政，不肯互相救應，更不肯聽從中央政府的指揮，起來作全面的抗戰，以致法郎哥有機可乘，而作各個擊破。</p>
<p>假使最初的巴斯克，奧斯多利亞，以及現在的加泰隆各邦，一開始就團結一致，聽命於中央政府，那末戰事的勝負，恐怕至今還不能判定吧。</p>
<p>國與國之間，尤其弱者對於强者，要起而抗爭，與打擊者以打擊，惟一的方法，便是聯合一致，全面抵抗。否則，强者必佔勝利，弱者必遭覆亡。於古，我們可以徵之戰國時的合縱連橫，於今，那就可以將西班牙爲殷鑑。</p>
<p>因此，中國抵抗日本，在最初時期，沒有發動全國的力量，以致失陷了東北，七七以來，還有韓復築的貽誤戎機。直到八一三，燃起了上海的烽火，我們方才操了勝算。此後節節撤退，節節抵抗，原不過按照整個計劃，次第實行。現在，我們已有了勝利的完全把握，更不容一些懷疑。推原其故，最重要的，也就是我們能夠失之東隅，收之桑榆，及早團結起來，在中央政府領導之下，起來作一致的抗戰罷了。</p>
<p>西班牙共和軍假使馬上就聯合起來，再接再厲，我想最後的結局，還在未定之天，大事還沒有到不可爲的地步，轉危爲安，不是沒有希望的。否則西班牙的厄運，是西班牙自己造成的：「自作孽，不可活，」徒供後來讀史者的嘆息而已！</p>
<h3>三臺夢蹟</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>明英宗和景宗時，也先入寇，正是現今敵人的影子。屢次索賄，從無鑒足；輕視中國，以爲一戰可取，等到于謙在京師抗戰，纔知道中國實未可侮，大大的碰了一個釘子。「西湖佳話」卷之八「三事夢蹟」就是專寫于謙的生平的。所述大部分根據明史卷一百七十本傳。惟開端敘于謙幼時軼事，則取之傳說。連泥塑的　也怕于謙，被派往嶺南充軍就害怕，被命令屈膝就只得依從，這種故事是我們常在林蘭所輯的「失洪武故事」裏所能看到的。至於出口成章，屬對敏捷，那又在林蘭所輯的「趣聯的故事」裏也可見到。至於專與和尚屬對談話，那只是爲了本傳上有這樣兩句話：『有僧奇之曰：「他日救時宰相也！」』在三臺夢蹟裏，便是：那和尚道：『諸君莫笑，此子骨格不凡，出口成章，他日撥亂宰相也！』</p>
<p>關於于謙守京師禦也先之事，明史本傳和西湖遊覽志餘卷八都有記載。明史較好，不像志餘那樣的迂闊：寫戰爭塲面，亦以明史爲較有聲色，不像志餘那樣的有氣無力。時爲景泰元年十月，明史云：『也先挾上皇破紫荊關，直入窺京師，有亨議斂兵堅壁老之。謙不可，曰：「奈何示弱，使敵益輕我！」亟分遣諸將率師二十二萬，列陣九門外。悉開諸城門，身自督戰，下令：「臨陣將不願軍先退者，暫其將；軍不顧將先退者，後隊斬前隊。」於是將士知必死，皆用命。初，也先深入，視京師可旦夕下。及見官軍嚴陣待，意稍沮。叛　喜寗嗾使邀大臣迎駕，索金吊以萬萬計，帝不許，也先氣益沮。庚申，寇窺德勝門，謙令亨設伏空舍，遺數騎誘敵，敵以萬騎來薄，副總兵范廣發火器，伏起齊擊之，也先弟中槍死。彰義門寇逐至士城，居民升屋號呼，投磚石擊寇。譁聲動天。援至，寇乃卻。相持五日，也先邀請既不應，戰又不利，知終弗可得志，遂擁上皇西去，謙調諸將追擊至關而還。論功另謙少保，總督軍務。』（節）至於三臺夢蹟的本文，我想可以不必在此繁引了。</p>
<p>上面引文有兩點可以注意，第一，也先「視京師旦夕可下」，此與敵人之估計台兒莊一樣，及至受挫以後，方纔歎了一口氣說：「想不到小小的台兒莊，這樣的困難！」第二，民衆升屋以磚石抗戰，獲得成功，於此更足見民衆武裝之必要。倘若全國皆兵，處處可戰，那末敵人將防不勝防，終至於崩潰了。</p>
<p>于謙的愛國可於志餘卷八見之：「景泰間北伐南征，軍務旁午。公常一日而平章者數端，夜分乃罷，輒撫膺曰：「一腔血竟灑何地！」」</p>
<p>他的詩在明紀事乙籖卷十一中春有五首。志餘並錄斷句。如詠蘇武云：「富貴儻來君莫問，丹心報國是男兒。」又云：「蕭澀行囊君莫笑。獨留牠劍倚青天。」均「可以知其孤介絕俗之操」和「忠直之氣」</p>
<p>明人追念于謙的詩，較著名的有黃鳳翔的「謁于少保詞」云：「九鼎奠如山，邊塵靜若捲。」又，楊焯的「拜于忠肅公墳」云：「憶星期景泰年間事，隻手扶天助天討。司馬門前鐵騎塞，居庸關外攙槍掃。」</p>
<p>某君所作「五千年來中華民族魂」（？）以于謙爲四中樞之一，與謝安李綱虞允文並列，足見推祟之至。</p>
<p>寫于謙的小說，尚有明弊高亮的「于少保萃忠全傳」十卷四十傳。還有一種明人的「正統傳」是罵于謙的。前者存而後者已佚，足見「公道自在人心」了。</p>
<h3>有求不應</h3>
<h3>勤務兵</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>——戰地旅行雜感</p>
<p>一位軍官的太太，問我爲什麽不帶個勤務兵，我說：「本來也有過一個勤務兵，後來在南京戰死了。我從山西南歸以後，深深覺得用勤務兵是不合理的。」我的意思是想告訴她：「在軍隊中，呌勤務兵做點軍中公務，那還可以說得過去；或呌勤務兵來替軍官太太當聽差，那是不應該的。」過了不久，她的勤務兵「開小差」，自己走了，她大爲發火說：「我那一件不好好兒看待他？打了牌，頭錢也是他的！吃的穿的，那一樣不比別人好，你看，那些兵，這天氣，還不是凍得打抖！」我因爲相識較久，就開誠對她道：「太太，這是你所不懂的：你說他樣樣不缺少，但他缺少了兩樣頂重要的東西——「希望」和「光榮」。做軍官的勤務兵已沒有多大希望，做軍官太太的勤務兵，更沒有希望；做軍官的勤務兵，已不光榮，做軍官太太的勤務兵，更不光榮。你想：他即有了希望，居然升了小軍官了，別人私下說他，原是替某軍官太太做勤務兵的，他的臉擱到那裏去？別人我不知，我自己即算餓死凍死，決不做勤務兵，除非我的愛人做了軍官，她做穆桂英，我做楊宗保。」她們聽了，都相視大笑。</p>
<p>我的弟弟李　，在軍隊中過活多年，曾綜括軍中人對於勤務兵的感喟道：「五百年必有王老興，一千年難得一個好的勤務兵！」勤務兵之難得其人，彷彿比行政院長還不容易。仔細想來，並不是勤務兵難得其人，實在勤務兵這制度，根本是錯誤的。他們詛咒勤務兵的，原說其中聰明的會調皮，揩油，姘軍官太太，無所不至；其老實的，蠢笨如牛，什麽事都得撥一撥動一動，無時不嘔氣。但考察勤務兵所有的事務，當該軍官未發達時，都是他自己料理的，做了軍官，並無不能自己料理之理。而那些替軍官太太服務的勤務兵，其實只是替太太省下了一個娘姨錢，拆穿來說，也是揩公家的油水，圖自己的利便，十二分不應該的。那軍官太太所以要用勤務兵，省錢固是一因，要表示自己是軍官的太太，更爲其主因，這也是一種極錯誤的心理。</p>
<p>我們過隨軍生活時，曾相約自己的細務自己料理，養成自己服務的習慣；這習慣的結果很好，有時交互服務反而能增進深切的友誼。我常說官僚政治若不打破，便沒有建國的希望，要打破官僚政治，先得從打破「布爾喬亞」的老爺太太觀念起。　一月二十七日在贛寄</p>
<h3>趕路（上）</h3>
<p>— 牆頭草</p>
<p>我們三個是「俘虜」。</p>
<p>一伙兒共十九個。距離很不一致：幾個人密擠在一堆，因爲路徑狹窄的緣故，他們恐怕滑下田滕裏去，有的疏郎地遠隔著十幾步。</p>
<p>九月的天空陰沉沉的，很憂鬱。出發不久，又濛濛地下起細雨來了。大衆的腳步不由地加緊著。後邊總嫌著前面走得過慢，不時嚴厲地呼叱著：「快走！快走！」</p>
<p>眞是不湊巧，我底腳上恰恰生著個瘡，皮鞋又緊，箍得隱隱地作痛。我的步履顯得比大家蹣跚，有時還不免停下來俯著鬆一鬆鞋帶；那個派定看管我的細白麻子的僞警就不時的嘮叨：</p>
<p>「哼，還不是故意的？慢得蝸牛一樣，想覷個機會逃跑嗎？」</p>
<p>敵意地盯了他一眼，把腳步放得更慢一點。他卻惱了，狠狠地猛撞一下肩膀：</p>
<p>「你眞想逃跑？看你有種！試試看！哼！」</p>
<p>這次，我沒有睬他，明知要發作不免會更　虧，祗得慢慢地增快腳步。</p>
<p>「這才對，」他鼻子裏又哼了一聲，可得意啦。</p>
<p>雨點漸漸地變大，各人身上的衣服都淋得濕透，感著打顫的涼意。我掠著亂蓬的頭髪，擰下一把水來。腳下更泥濘得累人，一步一滑的，不小心準會栽上幾個筋斗。</p>
<p>押在隊伍最後面的是位翹牙鬚的傢伙，光景是個僞巡官。粗粗一看，簡直要把他當作××人的。</p>
<p>他像肥豬般呼呼喘著氣，汗粒繼續在額上淌，便不停地從衣裝裏摸出手帕來拭去，嘴裏卻牛一樣的含糊地吆喝著：</p>
<p>「快些兒！弟兄們！」他叱著那些走得慢些的，「走上前去，把距離縮短！」</p>
<p>「快些兒呀！」細白麻子蠻有精神地應和著。</p>
<p>「是用腳走的呀！」</p>
<p>是前面的聲音，唧噥得很輕，翹牙鬚準沒聽見，所以仍是照樣的：「快些！快些！」似乎很著急，在疑神疑鬼的擔心路上會出岔子。</p>
<p>經過村落時，一些人都用著驚異的眼光望著我們，一看見僞警們兇煞地荷著槍，又都畏縮地退開去。狗，成羣地尾著我們狺狺狂吠著。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>葉太太忍不住伸了舌頭說：</p>
<p>『跟著你們的軍隊走，我可吃不來那種苦！』</p>
<p>葉團長還沒有回答，他那兩條鐵也似的臂膀忽然被他的弟弟方英妹妹方慧一邊一條抓住了。方慧用一種女孩子特有的嬌憨態度，撒嬌撒癡的說；</p>
<p>『大哥，你答應同我們到前方去已有好久了，總不實行，現在敵人已經快要打過來了，你到底什麽時候同我們走？我們願意和你同赴國難。』</p>
<p>葉太太連忙呵喝說：</p>
<p>『方慧不許胡鬧！你一個女孩兒家，跑到前方去做什麽？並且我們大家都在商量逃難，你卻要跑到前方去，這算是什麽意思？』</p>
<p>『邊呌做共赴國難。』方慧仍舊很嬌憨的說：『我看你們想逃難還是逃不了，倒不如共赴國難的好。』</p>
<p>葉老先生把殘餘的紙煤拋在地下，踏熄了火，點點頭說：</p>
<p>『這話倒也有道理，不過共赴國難的事，還是你們年青人幹來出色，我們老年人是不行的了。現在國家這樣危急，我也不阻止你們年青人把生命貢獻出去，我唯一的希望，只要能給我留下方文這孩子來，承接我葉氏門中的香煙就夠了。』</p>
<p>『你……你……』葉太太氣急得說不出話來，只是把手指著葉老先生。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>葉團長卻在問著他的弟妹：</p>
<p>『你們想到前方去，不知道你們可能受得住前方那種空氣？那邊一天二十四小時都在硝煙彈雨中，聞花砲轟轟的直打過來，子彈噓噓的四面亂飛，飛機不停的在頭上轉，轟隆隆的直扔炸彈，這不是受了些軍事訓練就中用的。』</p>
<p>『你不要管，只要同我們去就是了。』方英用很堅決的口氣說。</p>
<p>『好！』葉團長說了這一聲，便回過頭去，對他父親說：『我想就帶他們同去也好，我早就打算過了，英弟可以幫我做政治宣傳工作，訓練士兵和民衆，慧妹可以救護傷兵，比留他們在家裏好。』</p>
<p>『方俊，』葉太太用幾乎是帶哭的聲音呌：『你不要聽他們小孩子家胡說，我是無論怎樣不放他們去的，連你我都有些不放心哩，不要說他們了。』</p>
<p>葉團長不耐煩地向他母親搖了搖手，又低頭對他弟弟妹妹說：『不過現在我卻不能帶你們同去，現在前方軍情緊急，帶了你們走，不但不能幫助我什麽，反而要做我的累贅。』（八）</p>

<h3>卓別麟的「獨裁者」及其他</h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>好萊塢競攝反德片　寶萊高黛重上銀幕</p>
<p>據卓別麟向人表示，在他的新片「獨裁者」Dictator中。他飾演獨裁者一角時，關於化裝方面，所剪的頭髪，所裝的假鬚，將極力的模倣那個德國的獨裁者。這部影片的開拍，無疑，是卓氏對於德國禁映他的滑稽影片所予的一種報復。</p>
<p>卓別麟素來反對聲片，理由是演員開了口，當「城市之光」拍攝時，聲片盛行，默片早已絕跡，但他還是拍的默生。「摩登時代」雖是聲片，可是卓別麟沒有開過一聲口，堅持他在銀幕上不開口的諾言。如果這一次在「獨裁者」一片中，破例開口，他開起口來，幽默到如何程度，倒也耐人尋味！</p>
<p>在德美國交破裂的當兒，說是和卓別麟的「獨裁者」同時開拍的或計劃中的，還有幾部是反德，反納粹黨，反法西斯蒂的影片。好萊塢的影片公司，拍攝帶有政治色彩的影片，興趣有如此濃厚，恐怕還是第一次哩！</p>
<p>和卓別麟同居不久，就鬧離異，在「摩登時代」中擔任過女主角的寶萊高黛，在銀幕下遭遇了情變的痛苦，在銀幕上也好久沒有和我們見面。但恰巧在卓別麟宣佈開拍「獨裁者」時，好萊塢傳出了她將主演一部新片，呌「戲劇學校」Dramatic　School的消息。</p>
<h3>慶頂珠蕭恩之哭腔</h3>
<p>— 慤厂</p>
<p>余叔岩從善如流　現在已經不用</p>
<p>慶頂珠（即打漁殺家）是充滿了革命色彩的一　戲，其編排之　緊湊，可說是無一不佳。當初譚貝勒（鑫培）與王瑤唧合作時，眞是空前絕後，</p>
<p>妙到絕頂　譚氏故後，當然要以余叔岩爲最佳，馬連良譚富英輩雖然也常以此戲來號召，但是究嫌火候不夠，不能恰到好處。若以全戲來批評，可以出一本專書，絕不是這小小的地方，可以說得完的。所以我現在僅就殺家一塲，桂英唱完了原板，蕭恩被責後返家上唱搖板一段來說幾句話。我聽得老輩說：譚老板唱到「無奈何咬牙關忙把家奔」一句，並不使哭腔，而是將奔字高揚，而略使小腔。但是我第一次聽余叔岩唱到這一句是，是用很牠的哭腔，後來聽馬　連良唱，也是如此。我當時因爲聽著好聽，所以反覺得應該如此唱。至老輩所說的譚老板的唱法，到以爲是傳聞失實了。有一次在舍親祝惺元君處（祝君與譚老板是莫逆之交，對於譚戲極有研究，譚老板打鼓罵曹所用的鼓，現在仍然存在祝府，叔岩幾次託人想要這個鼓，但是祝君因爲是故人所送，始終不肯割愛。）得與叔岩同談，起始先談了些關於戲的故事，後來我就提出了這個問題來問叔岩</p>
<p>打漁殺家　的「忙把家奔」一句是不是譚老板就唱哭腔？叔岩總算不錯，並不嫌我問的冒昧，他就很坦白的說譚老板確是不用哭腔，我因爲增加情感及戲的緊張起見，才改唱哭腔的。我聽了還沒有回答，祝君就插嘴說，叔岩你這個見解錯了，我塢先不要管譚老板當初是不是唱哭腔，祗就戲情來說吧，蕭恩是不是個大英雄？在與倪榮見面時的試力，仍然能現出老當愈壯的精神，在與衆敎師用武時，尤其表示他不可一世的氣概。以這們一個大英雄，怎麼會竟連這四十大板全受不住，祗落得大哭而歸，這眞是把大英雄給罵苦啦！你要是明瞭這一點，我勸你還是改了的好。我當時聽了固然是如夢初醒，點首不止。就是余叔岩聽了，當時也極口贊成，並且說了一句「祝爺，眞有你的，我佩服了你啦！我准改准改」過了這次談話，沒有幾個月，我居然又在一個堂會戲裏聽見</p>
<p>余梅合作　的慶頂珠。到了這一塲的時候，我是特別注意，一聽果然改唱高腔，而不再哭了。我當時又拿祝君的話廻憶一次，再在現時上塲的情形一研究，覺得這樣唱，實在比哭要强的多。因爲唱高腔可以表示出英雄受了挫折寃苦，含有無限的恐憤神情，是正合蕭恩的身份，且與戲情吻合。要是一哭，就要顯出蕭恩之無能狼狽，軟弱。後來又如何可以下決心去殺丁府的全家呢？我對於余叔岩之能從諫如流，非常佩服，順便我還國勸馬連良也以早改爲是，至於譚富英呢——我聽過一次，他到沒有用哭腔，譚氏文孫，是到底不同的。</p>

<h3>哀艷劇本「雷雨」改編歌劇</h3>
<p>— 皓</p>
<p>中國最優秀的劇作者曹禺先生的第一部結晶「雷雨」自從發表以來，轟動一時，不但在國內獲得千萬觀衆的讚賞，就是在國外，也曾經紅過一時的。二年以前在日本上過多次舞台，賣座很不差，並且現在的原文已經譯成英日各國文字了。</p>
<p>在中國各地已先後在舞台上演過不知多少次了，而且又攝成電影公演過，現在據南洋吧城傳來的消息：該地的「中國旅行歌舞劇」打算把「雷雨」改編成歌劇配上歌曲舞蹈，以及配製的曲譜，搬上歌壇，把文學上有價值的作品編爲歌劇，這還是中國第一次的創舉。希望「中國旅行歌劇團」鄭史編導，不要糟蹋了原作的值得才好。</p>
<h3>看戲日記</h3>
<p>— 旭初</p>
<p>二月三日　今天是崑曲名家顧傳玠與崑曲名票張元和訂婚的日子。喜筵畢還有餘興。幾個朋友唱過皮黃以後，便是朱傳茗和顧傳玠的販馬記。賓客中有人對著傳玠高聲大喊：「請唱梳裝跪池！」於是傳玠作掛行招呼，賓客哄堂大笑。接著又有人熱烈地要求張女士唱；張女士連忙逃進房間裏，終於被李恂女士勸駕出來。李女士一面鼓掌，一面低頭彎腰地笑著在前面領導。於是張女士唱了一曲紅梨記亭會，傳玠站在台下第一排微笑地靜聽，也許這一曲足以引起她們甜蜜的回憶，所以纔對亭會有這樣的愛好吧？在聽過潘　懋　應姊妹合唱牡丹亭遊園以後，我便帶著愉快回家了；我祝福傳玠元和這一對藝人生活美滿，也像牡丹一樣。</p>
<p>二月五日　看蘊慧女士演「武家坡」和「大登殿。」嗓音甚爲響亮，突轉低音，亦委婉盡致；這樣的歌喉，不僅女票友中不可多得，就是在正式的劇人中怕也是少有的吧？提籃逃走的身段和步法都很美，像是一幅名畫。最後十三個哪哈哧也很好聽，像珍珠一樣的圓轉，像銀鈴一樣的清脆。</p>
<p>蘊慧女士劇照</p>
<p>二月六日　晚赴周壽同樂會。最值得欣賞的是「過江赴宴」中唐大郎的孔明，噱頭百出。比方說，墊子跪過以後拋到兩丈高，開拋墊的新紀錄；嗓音尤其勝過麒麟童，無怪乎樓上的朋友們要高喊一聲「唐大郎來一個追韓信；」將進塲時，回頭一望，百媚俱生，有如青衣花旦；忽然右手在牠大的袖子裏伸不出來了，忙用左手去掏摸；靜坐時則東張西望，否則就舉頭向著樓上的朋友們：彩聲之多，當推大郎爲第一。靈犀的六個孩子看見爸爸在台上扮魯肅，忽然變了鬍子伯伯，也特別感到興趣。</p>
<p>二十七日　卡爾登看到話劇「花濺淚」。作者于伶眞像易卜生似的特別同情於被侮辱與被損害的女性的命運。此劇從今天起，將連濱六天，我看到舞女米米說起她的假母鞭打她並且在她身上搜索鈔票的時候，幾乎爲之掉淚。同時想起袁牧之所編導的電影「馬路天使」。男人們每每玩弄女性，玩厭了就丟掉，好像棄掉舊鞋一樣；米米之受常海才的侮辱，另一舞女之受小陳的欺騙，正是現社會所常有的事。那末，他們以後應該怎樣走她們的路呢？我想，孤島上可尊貴的女性們看了此劇以後，一定會有很好的解答的。</p>

<h3>王慧蟾獻身銀幕</h3>
<p>— 綱</p>
<p>邇來坤伶中，改易鏡頭生活者，流行頗盛，而一般從事影業者，更廣爲羅致，競相延聘，亦伶影兩界間一大變遷也。昨於老友馬一笠兄宴會席上，得晤坤伶王慧蟾，又將獻身銀幕閒矣。</p>
<p>王慧蟾（一名桂珍）爲海上名琴師王百水君女公子，年方二八，姿貌娟秀，聰明伶俐，與影人袁美雲，乃表姊妹行。幼嘗隨北平名票沈棠卿習嗓，宗法瑤卿，神似畢肖。好事者均以小王瑤卿目之，能戲頗夥。上年迭次於籌振劇上，連朝演出，伶票各方，咸刮目相看，譽爲後起俊傑。最近膺某臺爲臺柱，有周郎癖者，趨之若鶩，輙告滿座，嗣以包銀小故，突然輟演，逍袁美雲游說，幾度往返，卒告成功。</p>
<p>慧蟾對鏡頭志趣，亦相當濃厚，且認鏡頭上，較易紓易紓展抱負，而於社會略可盡些貢獻，非似伶業專爲他人爭錢牟利可比，聞將在「花木蘭」片中，擔任要角，其前途之光明，正可拭目待之。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Advances to the Northwest of Juntaidian; Zao Gang Xia Le Gang is Completely Recovered; The Second Air Force Bombs Two Japanese Warships off Weizhou Island, Both Hit; Japanese Military Conference Decides to Defend the Outskirts of Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) In recent weeks, there have been no major battles on any fronts. The Japanese and Guangdong armies are still deploying frequently. The Japanese troops from Sanshui Xinhui have mostly moved to Zengcheng, posing a threat to the east. Six Japanese warships have arrived in Chaozhou and Shantou, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, with intentions of landing. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui. Zao Gang Xia Le Gang, after a fierce counterattack by a certain Chinese army, was completely recovered on the evening of the 7th. Furthermore, a certain Chinese army has advanced to the northwest of Juntaidian, around Fengcun Longkou Xinjie. The Japanese are now defending firmly, and the positions remain unchanged. (Eighth Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui. The Chinese army launched a two-pronged counterattack on Sanshui, one towards the southwest and one towards Hekou. From 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 6th, the sound of artillery fire never ceased east of Sanshui, and the fighting was fierce. (Seventh Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reliable sources, a squadron of the Chinese Air Force flew to Tokyo Bay's Weizhou Island yesterday and bombed it. At least two Japanese warships were damaged by the bombing. The Japanese military's newly built aircraft hangars and gasoline depots were all hit and caught fire. (Eighth Day Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops on Weizhou Island have increased to 32,000. Among them, 30,000 arrived on the island on the 2nd of this month, transported by 18 transport ships from Taiwan. As a result, the situation in Beihai and Fangcheng is becoming increasingly tense. Japanese warships off Fangcheng Bailongwei have been repeatedly using motorboats to carry soldiers to attack Chinese army positions on the shore, attempting to land, but they have all been repelled by the Chinese army. It is reported that Lieutenant General Neitian, commander of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army, recently convened a military conference in Guangzhou. The result was a decision to defend the existing positions on the outskirts of Guangzhou and to use the main force to invade Guangxi Province. (Eighth Day Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan. On the morning of the 6th, about 1,000 Japanese troops attacked Zhoujiacun in Bao'an County. The Chinese local forces fought hard to resist. The battle was fierce. Subsequently, due to intense Japanese artillery fire, all fortifications were destroyed, and they moved to a certain place, still engaging the Japanese army. (Seventh Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan. Xinjie, Tan, Longkou, and other places have about 400 Japanese soldiers. They have not launched any attacks recently. The Japanese troops in Jiangcun Gaotang are very busy building fortifications along the river. (Eighth Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news. The Japanese army in South China has been unsuccessful for a long time, and domestic financial resources are stretched. Military expenses and supplies have become a problem. Recently, to find ways to provide supplies locally, it has been decided to open gambling dens in Guangzhou for the Lunar New Year, and send a large number of young women to Guangdong to work as waitresses in restaurants to attract customers. Furthermore, in order to entice middle and upper-class people to return to the city, they are willing to transfer all Japanese soldiers in the city to the suburbs and replace them with Chinese police. However, this cunning plan will hardly succeed. (Eighth Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman, who told foreign newspaper reporters that the total budget for the Japanese army from April of last year to April of this year was 4,800,000,000 yen, but the total budget for the period from April of this year to April of next year has been reduced to 4,500,000,000 yen. This shows that the number of Japanese troops stationed in China has decreased. The Japanese army is now worried about the reduction in manpower. The main reason for Japan's revision of the conscription law is that, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the total number of Japanese casualties has reached 700,000, and it is extremely difficult to recruit new soldiers to replenish the ranks. The main contents of Japan's revision of the conscription law are as follows: The period during which reservists are prepared to join the army at any time has been extended from twelve years and four months to seventeen years and four months. According to the old conscription law, university students under the age of 25 could be exempted from military service. This clause has now been deleted. According to reports received, untrained Japanese youths are also being drafted to the front lines in China. These untrained youths are "purely raw materials and not fit to participate in combat." When asked how many reinforcements the Japanese could still send from Japan proper, the spokesman said, "This is a secret of the Japanese army that we know very well, and we are unwilling to disclose it. Otherwise, the Japanese will know how thoroughly we know their secrets." The spokesman further pointed out that part of the Japanese army in Central China recently withdrew suddenly, but there has been no increase in the Japanese army in North China. When asked where the Japanese troops withdrawn from Central China and South China were moved, the spokesman said, "This is another military secret that we are unwilling to disclose." (Eighth Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman declared to the press that, apart from minor skirmishes in southeastern Shanxi and occasional artillery battles across the Tongguan, all other fronts in Central China, East China, North China, and South China were very calm, with no news to report. In the South China Sea, apart from the Japanese army completing a small airfield on 　Zhou Island outside Beihai and about ten Japanese warships cruising nearby, there has been no other movement by the Japanese army. The Japanese army in eastern and northern Henan is completely inactive. (Eighth Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Urgent Need to Improve Domestic Trade</h3>
<p>China's domestic trade has been given the same importance by the government since the War of Resistance, because foreign trade has suffered from the maritime blockade. According to recent reports, inter-provincial trade between provinces has made considerable progress compared with the past, thanks to the government's planning and the promotion of local authorities in various provinces; in particular, inter-provincial trade between Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces has been particularly prosperous. However, looking at the overall situation in China, the current domestic trade does not seem to be able to meet the needs of the environment, and the government and the people still need to work hard to develop it.</p>
<p>In normal times, the production and consumption of the domestic people need the coordination of domestic trade; during wartime, the need for this coordination is even more urgent. Now, the Chinese government, in order to support the long-term war of resistance, is actively engaged in the development of mining, the construction of industry, and the reform of agriculture in the interior. These undertakings, of course, require scientific technology, but they also require raw materials and markets; and the acquisition of raw materials and the opening up of markets must have a very developed domestic trade. If China wants to build the foundation of a wartime economy, developing domestic trade is one of its important tasks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the foreign trade control policy currently implemented by the government, the assistance of domestic trade is urgently needed: Among the commodities prohibited from import by the government, there are indeed many that can be produced in large quantities in the country, but because of the underdevelopment of domestic trade, some places still cannot obtain domestic supply in terms of demand. For example, rice is China's main agricultural product, and last year was a bumper harvest, but under the import restriction order of foreign rice in Fujian Province, there is still a shortage of food; as for the commodities prohibited from export by the government, due to the blockage of sales channels, it is easier to affect the livelihood of the general people. Recently, the Chinese government recognized Shanghai as an area under the violent control of the Japanese and prohibited the shipment of 54 kinds of local products such as cotton and tung oil to Shanghai, resulting in the accumulation of various local products in the ports of eastern Zhejiang and southern Fujian, and merchants have suffered considerable losses as a result. If China's domestic trade is developed, the rice shortage in Fujian Province can be supplied from Hunan and Jiangxi, and the local products of eastern Zhejiang can be easily transported to the neighboring provinces in the southwest, or directly purchased by the government in the above-mentioned areas and resold abroad. Therefore, in order to promote the effectiveness of foreign trade control, the Chinese government should also develop domestic trade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As for the areas controlled by Japanese military force: Since the war zone has gradually expanded, the Japanese economic burden itself cannot be borne, and it is now using the vast occupied area, on the one hand, to plunder various agricultural and mineral products, and on the other hand, to try to create a market monopolized by Japanese goods. Recently, more than one million dans of rice in the Yangtze River Basin were loaded and taken away by the Japanese. Last year, cotton in North China was shipped to Japan, valued at 100 million yuan. The most effective way for the Chinese government to break Japan's economic encroachment action, which is advancing in parallel with military force, is to find ways to develop domestic trade, so that all the raw materials produced in the Chinese army's guerrilla areas will be transported to the interior without passing through the hands of the Japanese; and the necessary items needed by the people in the guerrilla areas will also be supplied by the interior. At present, the places that Japan can control in the occupied areas are only some of the larger cities, and its economic activities dare not leave the cities a step. Most of the trade outside the cities is done by a small number of unwilling Chinese. As long as the Chinese government finds ways to block the commerce in the cities of the guerrilla areas, the economic activities in the areas occupied by Japan can still be completely controlled by the Chinese government. Then, the rich materials in the vast guerrilla areas will not only not help the enemy, but will also be enough to strengthen the government's strength in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>From the above points, it can be seen that the development of China's domestic trade is indeed very urgent. However, to develop domestic trade, it is necessary to develop domestic transportation first, which is more difficult at present, but the government is now working hard on it, and has already shown good results. In addition, in order to speed up the development of domestic trade, it is best to organize an agency by the central government to adjust domestic trade, specializing in planning, investigation, guidance, and practical management of the development of domestic trade; at the same time, local authorities in various provinces should abide by central laws and regulations for inter-provincial trade, and give special convenience. In times of war, most transactions are more troublesome in terms of procedures. It is best to adopt the method of barter. For example, at present, Fujian Province exchanges Fujian salt for Jiangxi rice, and in the future, Guangdong Province can also exchange Guangdong salt for Hunan rice. Sichuan Province can also use the countless rich products of the whole province to exchange fur and livestock with the northwestern provinces, and the southwestern provinces can exchange hardware and groceries. By extension, it will not only promote the development of domestic trade, adjust the imbalance of supply and demand in various places, but also, for military purposes, because the flow of materials is smooth, the order of social life is stable and prosperous, it is enough to establish a strong economic foundation for the war of resistance, so the improvement of domestic trade is indeed an urgent plan today!</p>

<h3>Dissolution of Foreign Flight Squadron in Chinese Air Force; American Aviator Hunt Returns Home; He Firmly Believes China Will Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) American aviator Hunt, who served in the Chinese Air Force for nearly a year, recently returned here from China. It is said that the foreign-organized flight squadron in the Chinese Air Force has been dissolved because the Soviet Union has sent sufficient pilots and aircraft to China, so there is no need to use foreigners anymore. After the dissolution of the foreign flight squadron, each member received a severance payment of one thousand yuan. Afterwards, Hunt went to Hong Kong and took the "President Taft" ship back to the United States. When the ship arrived in Japan, he went ashore for a visit. He said that the Japanese people were extremely war-weary, bearing extremely heavy taxes, and he firmly believed that China would eventually win the final victory. Hunt said that initially he obtained sponsorship from someone in Chinatown, San Francisco, and obtained a passport under the name of a musician to go to China to enlist. Initially, it was said that in addition to all expenses, he would receive a remuneration of 500 US dollars per month. There were about twenty foreign pilots serving in China, with nationalities including Australia, France, Germany, and the United States. The foreign flight squadron was initially formed in Hankou, and pilot Barr, who transported supplies to General Chiang Kai-shek by plane during the Xi'an Incident, came to test them, and those who failed were eliminated. According to Hunt, when fighting the Japanese air force in China, the ratio of Chinese and Japanese aircraft was often one to five. Therefore, their strategy was to wait quietly at high altitude for an opportunity to attack isolated Japanese aircraft that had left the formation. He said, "Seeing the indiscriminate bombing of the Japanese aircraft formation is extremely infuriating. French pilot Pouyau was unable to restrain himself because of this, and flew into the midst of six Japanese aircraft and fought the Japanese army, and died as a result. In addition, there were other deaths and injuries. Australian pilot Fay He was shot dead while jumping with a parachute. Gunner Hamil of Sangster and Mani was shot down from 500 feet in the air and fell to his death in a rice field." (July 7th, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Famine in Japan is Extremely Serious; Plan to Colonize Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to news received here from Dalian, the Japanese government plans to relocate 1.6 million Japanese families to "Manchukuo" in 1939. The Kwantung Army has already sent an official document to the puppet "Manchu" authorities, ordering them to prepare sufficient land to accommodate this large number of Japanese expatriates. It is understood that the reason for this large-scale immigration by the Japanese side is that the famine situation in the country has become extremely serious after the launch of the invasion of China war, and many civilians have no way to make a living. Therefore, they are seeking to implement this method of immigration to obtain food. (8th, Express News Agency)</p>

<h3>Chinese Government Pays Foreign Debt Principal and Interest; Bank of England Studies Ways to Help China; Equal Emphasis on Stabilizing Legal Tender and Developing the Southwest</h3>
<p>(London) People here were delighted to hear that China announced the payment of the March interest on the 1898 debt. All tariff-guaranteed bonds have risen by half a pound or more. People here still believe that China will eventually agree to continue to repay various tariff-guaranteed loans. However, it cannot be denied that this issue is closely related to the UK's continued financial assistance to China. This point is obviously a psychological effect, rather than the British people having any doubts about China's ultimate resources after the development of the southwest plan matures. At the same time, the opinions of those in the government who are most directly involved in discussing China's needs are not entirely consistent, because what China needs now is not just one thing, such as credit loans needed for economic development in the southwest and loans needed to assist China's legal tender. Some say that the plan to assist China's legal tender is the most difficult. It is heard that a senior official of the Bank of England is now working hard to think of a suitable solution. All circles in the UK clearly express sympathy with China, although some people feel that any plan for direct financial assistance must be carefully drafted to avoid criticism. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The British House of Commons raised the issue of continuing to lend to China again yesterday. (1) Will the British government continue to lend to facilitate trade with China? (2) Will the steps to be taken be within the scope of the Export Credit Guarantee Bureau, or will other methods be used? Hudson of the Department of Transportation replied that he could not continue to comment on the first question, and as for the second question, it must be determined based on individual circumstances. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Nicholson, Director of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce, published a letter in The Times on December 21 last year, stating that all businesses operating in China believed that Japan's ultimate goal was to eliminate all Western forces and businesses in the Far East. Mr. Kawamura, President of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in London, sent a letter to The Times on January 18 to refute this. Nicholson replied in the newspaper today, reiterating his previous statement: "Kawamura believes that Japan does not discriminate against foreign interests in China, and seems to want to imply that the facts described in my letter are inaccurate, but he obviously forgets that there are several members of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce who have businesses in China and have the most reliable information about the facts described in the letter. Leaving this aside, just citing the fact that the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have repeatedly sent notes to Japan is sufficient proof, because the governments of each relevant country would not issue such notes unless they were sure that their national interests in China were being severely threatened. Therefore, there is no doubt that Kawamura's statement that Japan is now using modern methods to deal with the Chinese and that this method has made the Japanese closer to them is a comical statement with the opposite meaning."

<h3>US Silver Purchase Policy Increases China's Purchasing Power; US Treasury Secretary Announces Unchanged Policy; More Than 300 Million Ounces of Silver Purchased</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently made a speech to the Senate Silver Committee today, briefly stating that the current US silver purchase policy has increased the purchasing power of silver-producing and silver-using countries, especially China and Mexico. If this policy is terminated, the US exports to these countries will decrease. As for the use of the silver purchased by the Treasury and the impact of silver prices on foreign trade, especially on trade with countries in the Far East, please submit written questions, and I will answer them one by one.

In order to meet future needs, it is necessary to issue more national debt. Morgenthau also said that the US silver purchase is of great help to China, and other countries such as Mexico, Canada, Peru, Chile, and the Philippines have all benefited from it. Morgenthau made this statement to the Senate Silver Committee. The committee adjourned after Pittman asked Morgenthau twelve questions, so that Morgenthau could answer them at the next meeting.

<h3>France Decides to Follow the United Kingdom and the United States to Implement a Firm Policy; British Parties Support Chamberlain's Declaration; Italian Authorities Do Not Deny Sending Troops to the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Senate recently discussed foreign policy today. As a result, it passed a motion with 291 votes against 16, expressing confidence in the government's determination to maintain the integrity of the colonial empire's territory and the safety of the imperial transportation lines. Members of the Socialist and Communist parties voted against it. Premier Daladier made a speech in advance, denying that France was isolated, and reviewing the recent statements made by US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Chamberlain. His conclusion was that "the imperial policy should not be a policy of retreat, but a policy of firmness." (7th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that when British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, he touched upon the Spanish issue. Foreign Minister Ciano did not confirm the statement that Italian volunteers would remain in Spain after the Spanish National Army had achieved military victory, and hinted that Prime Minister Mussolini might order them to be recalled in the short term. Foreign Minister Ciano denied the statement that German troops had entered Italy to prepare to station troops in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa to strengthen the garrison there, at least as far as sending troops to Libya was concerned. Sir Percy Loraine also drew Foreign Minister Ciano's attention to the concentration of Italian troops in Libya on the border with French Tunisia. Foreign Minister Ciano is said to have avoided answering, only saying that France was also mobilizing troops on the Tunisian border. (7th, Havas)</p>

<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on Anglo-French unity was moved forward because Parliament was adjourned yesterday, so it was not possible to hear Parliament's opinion on this. Judging from the comments of members of all parties in the House of Commons today, the declaration has been generally approved. The public originally thought that some countries seemed to be still doubtful about the British government's attitude in the already obvious environment, so Chamberlain had to clarify the UK's position to dispel doubts, and it could not be delayed any longer. And some people think that the Prime Minister's move has been delayed for several months. Almost all members of Parliament recognize that the Prime Minister's remarks are in line with the increasingly clear opinions of the United States and are indeed appropriate. The opposition Labor Party even went further, urging the French government to quickly stabilize closer relations between the various democratic countries, but the United States is particularly important. The whole country is satisfied with the government's current expression to France. It is believed that the result of this move will inevitably make Anglo-French relations stronger. In the past, many members of the seats behind the Parliament criticized the government's policies, but now they also unanimously express their approval. The opposition party has decided not to pursue this matter at present, because they pursue every declaration made by the government with all their strength and do not slack off. This is the greatest proof of the good effect of the Prime Minister's remarks in Congress. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) How is American foreign policy? Since President Roosevelt made a statement on the 3rd of this month, the political and journalistic circles are still discussing it. Although the date for the Senate to discuss foreign policy has been postponed, members of Congress still hope that the President will explain it in detail to dispel doubts. People from all walks of life also said that when the President secretly talked with the members of the Senate Army Committee, most members and the press, although they had the same feeling that the United States should assist the democratic countries in Europe in order to maintain its own interests, still thought that the President needed to explain it again clearly and publicly. As for the President's statement on the 3rd of this month, the press also disliked it for being empty and difficult to meet the expectations of the public (Note: The President's statement on that day explained that American foreign policy includes four points, namely: - No treaties of alliance are signed with foreign countries; - Promote international trade; - Approve of reducing armaments; - The United States is willing to maintain the political, economic, and social independence and sovereignty of all countries in the world by peaceful means). Some senators, including Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, even advocated that the records of the President's secret talks with the members of the Senate Army Committee, except for military intelligence, should all be made public. Since the President's secret talks with the members of the Army Committee, there have been many discussions. Some of the full-powered countries believe that there are differences of opinion within the United States, and that there is disagreement between the President and Congress on basic foreign policy. In fact, there is no fundamental difference between the two sides. What is being discussed is how to implement the procedures. All those who support President Roosevelt's policies, in view of this, also agree with the opposition's opinion, and advocate that the President should explain in detail to the press, so that all sectors have a clear understanding of the foreign policy pursued by the American government. In short, the focus of this debate is only on procedural issues, and it should not be regarded as a fundamental disagreement between the President and Congress on current policy. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister's Declaration Values Spain; Says National Army Authorities Have Guaranteed That If War Breaks Out in Europe, They Will Strictly Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>(Paris) At the Senate meeting this afternoon, Foreign Minister Bonnet made a speech explaining the current foreign policy. In addition to discussing the relations between France and Italy, France and Germany, and the friendship between France, Britain, and the United States, he also reiterated that France would never give up an inch of land. France cannot tolerate the territorial integrity of Spain being threatened by foreign countries. Foreign Minister Bonnet first stated, "Spain is located at the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. From a military point of view, it has a very important relationship to our country and the transportation lines to the various territories in Africa. If any country threatens the territorial integrity of Spain, it is tantamount to threatening the security of France, which is not something that we can tolerate. In September of last year, the Spanish National Army government instructed its representative in London to notify us that if war breaks out in Europe, the National Army government will strictly maintain neutrality. Later, it directly told us that the National Army government decided to maintain Spain's independence and would never allow foreign control. The Italian government also stated in the Anglo-Italian Agreement that it had no territorial or political ambitions for the islands belonging to mainland Spain and its overseas colonies. At the same time, the British government has also clearly expressed its position, that it maintains full joint relations with us regarding maintaining the independence of Spain. In summary, "France seeks nothing more than that all relevant parties respect their commitments." Regarding the refugee issue in Spain, after the French government issued an appeal to the National Army government, requesting that it facilitate the return of these refugees to their homeland, Jordana, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Army government, provided satisfactory guarantees to the French government representative, Senator Félard, which shows that France's only wish is to assist Spain in stabilizing the situation and to promote the reconciliation between Spaniards and Spaniards. Regarding the relations between France and Italy, we have repeatedly worked to eliminate misunderstandings between the two sides. After the Munich Agreement was concluded, the government appointed a new ambassador to Italy, which is clear evidence. "We firmly believe that the French and Italian nations sincerely wish to establish good relations. It is inconceivable that Italy would invade France or that France would fight Italy." France and Italy have the same cultural points and fought together for the same ideals during the European War. Such a relationship is by no means comparable. However, France's position should also be clearly explained: "I hereby reiterate on behalf of the French government that France will never cede an inch of land to Italy. Any attempt, anyone who is engaged in pursuing territorial ambitions, will inevitably lead to armed conflict, without a doubt." Regarding the relations between France and Germany, "The people of France are sincerely willing to establish a true understanding with Germany. The declaration of peace between France and Germany issued on December 6 last year was the first step in promoting relations between the two sides and can open a path for sincere cooperation between the two sides." Regarding the relations between France, Britain, and the United States, the friendship and satisfaction are unprecedented. British Prime Minister Chamberlain made declarations twice in the House of Commons on the first and sixth of this month, explaining the joint relations between Britain and France. "You know very well what this declaration means, and I don't need to repeat it." As for the attitude of US President Roosevelt, we deeply admire it. "Our country maintains close friendly relations with the US government. Washington has actively understood our actions on a large scale." The friendship between the three major democratic countries is peaceful. German leader Hitler had previously provided guarantees that he had no intention of "exporting" National Socialism, nor did he want to fight against the democratic countries. "We should also provide guarantees to them, declaring that all democratic countries have the same peaceful aspirations, and have no intention of propaganda to any country, let alone aggression." As for the policy pursued by France, "Its primary goal is to protect the integrity of the mainland territory and the colonial empire. The achievements France has made are the crystallization of work and iron blood. The French nation must now maintain it with courage. We should pass on the legacy left by the sages and martyrs to future generations and do not want to see it damaged." In addition, France is unwilling to give up the forces it possesses in other parts of the world. The friendship and treaties between France and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be preserved. "This is a precious property that should not be easily given up. In short, France will not give up its responsibilities anywhere." (7th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet stated during the Senate debate yesterday that the government's determination to maintain France and its territorial integrity, saying that France's policy is very simple, this kind of policy, we have received from our predecessors, and now we want to pass it on to future generations. Referring to the relationship between the United States and France, he said that the French government has maintained close contact with the US government in the past few weeks, and the US government is well aware of France's position. The three major democratic countries know their material and spiritual strength, know their position in the world and in history, and know that other countries cannot force their policies on them. The friendship of the three major democratic countries does not harm others, nor does it want to harm others. What we want is peace and the development of the three major democratic countries. No country in the world, whether strong or weak, can believe that these three countries will harm them. Bonnet finally referred to the rumor in the past few weeks that the Anglo-French agreement was not as close as it appeared on the surface, saying that the friend of France, Chamberlain, could answer this question.

<h3>Dictatorship and Democracy Approach: Italy and Soviet Russia Sign Economic Agreement; Britain to Discuss Trade with Germany; Germany Denies New Pact with Russia</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Stanley Baldwin stated in the House of Commons yesterday that British industrialists will begin formal discussions with a German industrial delegation in the middle of this month to resolve trade competition. The sincerity of both parties may make it possible to resolve many issues and avoid the need for other measures. Negotiations will involve neutral markets, Anglo-German trade, and competition. The British government intends to discuss Southeast European markets. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Situation in Spain: Britain, France, Germany, and Italy Vie for Influence; France Successfully Negotiates with Nationalist Army; German Newspapers Criticize British and French Mediation</h3>
<p>(London) The cabinet held a meeting this morning, focusing on the Spanish issue. It is rumored that Prime Minister Chamberlain advocated intensifying mediation between the two sides of the civil war. It is said that the terms of peace proposed by Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín include three points: 1. Foreign volunteers within Spain should be withdrawn; 2. The Nationalist Army authorities should provide guarantees that no retaliatory measures will be taken against personnel of the Republican government; 3. The future political system of Spain should be decided by a referendum or elections. It is said that the first two points have been accepted by General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, while the third point has been firmly rejected. Local informed sources say that the peace negotiations may proceed smoothly. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Moderate Senator Féraud, who was ordered to go to Burgos, Spain, to negotiate with the Nationalist Army government, has completed his mission and returned here at 9:30 this morning. He immediately paid a visit to Foreign Minister Bonnet at noon to report, and also visited Prime Minister Daladier to report. He then issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that he was treated with great courtesy by the Spanish Nationalist Army authorities, for which he was most grateful. However, he did not disclose the results of his trip. He said that the problem of Spanish refugees is likely to be resolved, and the Nationalist Army authorities are willing to accommodate women, children, and elderly refugees within their territory. However, those members of the government army and militia who have fled to France and wish to return to Spain must be screened before a decision is made on whether to allow them to stay. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Moderate Senator Féraud, after returning from the territory of the Spanish Nationalist Army government today, reported to Foreign Minister Bonnet at noon. It is said that his talks with Nationalist Army government Foreign Minister General Jordana were extremely harmonious. The Nationalist Army government authorities were able to understand everything, which is gratifying. The main mission of this trip, the problem of Spanish refugees, has yielded concrete solutions. The French government is eager for these refugees to return to their homeland as soon as possible, and the Nationalist Army authorities share this sentiment. Regarding political prisoners held by both sides of the civil war, after mediation by the French government, the two sides will soon arrange exchanges. As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and the Nationalist Army government, this is a major matter that the French government must consider at length. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Chamber of Commerce held a meeting here yesterday, with representatives from 144 organizations, and passed a resolution demanding that the government immediately appoint a diplomatic representative to Burgos. The resolution stated that if the establishment of normal relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist Army is delayed, French business in Spain will suffer. It also stated that in addition to sending a diplomatic representative to the seat of the Nationalist Army government, France should follow the lead of other countries and immediately send an economic delegation to observe the situation in various territories under the Nationalist Army. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, has notified the British government that he intends to occupy the island of Menorca in the Balearic Islands, but that this will be done by Spanish troops and that he does not intend to rely on foreigners. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The British cruiser HMS Devonshire has arrived at Port Mahon on the Spanish island of Menorca in the Mediterranean (currently occupied by the government army) and is scheduled to sail elsewhere tomorrow. Political observers believe that the British government is mediating with the parties involved in the Spanish civil war regarding the Nationalist Army's takeover of Menorca. The arrival of the Devonshire is probably related to this matter. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The island of Majorca in the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean has been occupied by Italy. The island of Menorca is still being defended by the Spanish government army. Naval figures here say that the island should not be controlled by Italy again. If the Spanish Nationalist Army wishes to occupy it, Britain has no objection, but must provide assurances that it will not be dominated by other powers. Regarding this matter, the British authorities are exchanging views with the French government and the two sides in the Spanish civil war. If an agreement can be reached, they intend to send a British warship to escort representatives of the Spanish Nationalist Army to the island to handle the takeover. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper, a semi-official organ, recently published an article stating that Italian troops would only be recalled after the Spanish Nationalist Army had achieved complete military and political victory. Today, it published another article clarifying that the so-called "political victory" consists of the following four points: 1. Any members of the Spanish government army who have fled into French territory should be disarmed and disbanded, rather than being allowed to retain their weapons and gather on the border, which would threaten Nationalist Spain. 2. All key figures of the Spanish Republican government who have fled to France should also be expelled and not allowed to speak out. 3. General Franco must only cease hostilities after the government army has surrendered unconditionally. 4. All conspiracies to force Britain and France to mediate should be abandoned. The gold deposited by the Republican government in the Bank of France should be taken over by the Nationalist Army government. Italy and Germany have a completely consistent attitude on the above four matters. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the conditions for Italy's withdrawal of volunteer soldiers, there have been repeated fluctuations. After semi-official sources in Italy hinted at this a few days ago, semi-official sources in Burgos, Spain, also hinted at it yesterday, intending to urge countries to establish normal relations with the Nationalist Army government first. Responsible officials here, upon learning of this, paid close attention to the simultaneous similar expressions from Italy and Spain, believing that General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, was taking this attitude due to pressure from Italy. Senator Féraud, sent by the French government to Spain, will return tomorrow. Responsible officials believe that the truth will only be clear after Féraud returns, and that the above-mentioned expression by semi-official sources in Spain is probably a test. In French political circles, there is much hope that France and the Nationalist Army government can establish normal contact with each other, but it is not appropriate to add formal recognition prematurely. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After news of the Spanish civil war potentially being mediated by Britain and France reached Berlin, newspapers here launched fierce attacks, stating that General Franco had been working hard and had victory within reach, but Britain and France were plotting to obstruct the final victory, which was an immoral undertaking. Italy made an important statement, believing that volunteer troops could only be withdrawn after the Nationalist Army had achieved complete military and political victory. The Italian newspaper, a semi-official organ, had much to say on this matter. The "German Central National Daily" stated, "The issue of Spanish territorial integrity should be decided entirely by the victor. The victor has gone through great hardships and shed blood to resolve the crisis of Bolshevism for Spain. This is not something that Britain and France can usurp." The "New German Observer" stated that Britain and France's attempt to mediate the Spanish civil war is nothing more than an attempt to seize a superior position in Spain. The "West German Observer" stated that General Franco's victory should not be compromised or devalued, as the goal of the civil war is to fight for freedom for Spain and to eradicate the red plague in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Burgos: Responsible officials here recently stated that all countries that have not established normal relations with the Nationalist Army government must quickly recognize the Nationalist Army government in law. Otherwise, the Nationalist Army government will refuse to have dealings with them. It is hoped that this issue can be resolved before the end of the civil war. Newspapers here stated that the conditions for establishing normal relations with the Nationalist Army government are three: 1. Recognize the Spanish "Red" government (referring to the Republican government) as an illegal government. 2. Do not make any reservations when establishing diplomatic relations with the Nationalist Army government. 3. All countries that have acquired anything in Spain since the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, including gold, securities, artwork, and ships, should return them to the Nationalist Army government. Any country that attempts to influence the Nationalist Army government's domestic and foreign policies, especially to induce the Nationalist Army government to separate from its existing allies, should be resisted with all its might.

<h3>Spanish Government Army Decides to Continue Fighting; Government Has Moved Back to Valencia; Nationalist Army Believes It Can Be Over in Two Months</h3>
<p>(London) According to the Spanish Embassy, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín, who recently crossed into France with members of his cabinet, will soon return to Spain to continue the struggle. The location of the government will likely be Valencia, not Madrid. A total of about 300,000 refugees have fled into France. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Spanish Republican Embassy in England issued a communiqué stating that the Spanish Republican government will move to the center of the country as soon as possible in order to resist to the end. Prime Minister Negrín and members of his cabinet will go to the center after the refugee problem is resolved to preside over the war of resistance. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Spanish Republican government officially announced tonight that it will continue to resist in the south and has rejected the rebel army's demand for unconditional surrender and the peace proposals put forward by Britain and France. The Spanish Embassy stated that Republican Prime Minister Negrín is determined to resist to the end in the area around Madrid and Valencia. This area includes nine provinces, covering about 47,000 square miles. According to diplomatic reports, Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo rejected the peace talks proposed by Britain and France, and the embassy then issued this declaration. The Republican government's determination to return to Valencia indicates that the Spanish civil war, which has lasted for 30 months, will continue for several weeks or months. General Miaja in Madrid has led 400,000 well-equipped troops to defend Madrid, Valencia, Cartagena, and Alicante. At the same time, the rebel leader only mocked the government army's determination to resist. General Franco will lead his troops to achieve final victory within six to eight weeks. Franco can also transfer 300,000 troops from Catalonia, Spanish Morocco, and Italy to the south and join the original rebel army in the center to launch an offensive. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Figueres: Republican Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo told reporters here, "The government, based on the will of the people, has decided to resist to the end. The government army, with the center as its base, can continue to fight for several months. Although the situation is very serious, we have the support of the entire nation and have great confidence in the final outcome." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Valencia: The Republican government issued a communiqué stating that "the government army units on the Catalan front, now shielded by many tanks, are retreating along the road between the two cities of El Puig and Sagunto." Almost all artillery has also been withdrawn. It has not yet been decided whether the garrison of El Puig will be withdrawn. Rumors here say that the Nationalist Army has occupied Isabar, only 18 kilometers from El Puig. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Cerbère: The government army's military supplies, now piled up on the border, are being prepared to be transported into France one after another. Late last night, 60 heavy trucks loaded with large quantities of machine guns, artillery shells, and bullets drove into France. In addition, 200 more will follow. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Economy to Issue More Paper Money</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After Economics Minister Funk succeeded Dr. Schacht as president of the Central Bank, the bank's vice president, Dresch, and five directors (there are eight directors in the bank) have been replaced one after another. The Frankfurter Zeitung reported that this change will make the relationship between the government and the bank closer. The Danziger Post reported that the German economic organization should still take stabilizing the currency as its main mission, and the Central Bank's business policy should remain the same and not be changed. However, in the current market, all five-mark silver coins have been withdrawn and replaced with paper money, so the amount of paper money in circulation will inevitably increase. This phenomenon does not seem to be a way to stabilize the currency, and the public cannot help but be surprised. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Former President of the German Central Bank Schacht will leave the country within days for a long-term trip to Southeast Europe. Political figures here believe that Schacht's mission is to complete the wishes of Economics Minister Funk, who has conducted business negotiations with Southeast European countries and Turkey without results. Schacht will continue negotiations. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Deutsche Bank director Ick, based on pre-war statistics, made an estimate of the economic situation of Germany recovering its colonies, saying that if Germany recovers its colonies, it can soon save 200 million marks in foreign exchange each year. The export of German colonies increased from 28 million marks in 1908 to 162 million marks in 1913. If Germany regained its land and devoted itself to its agriculture, the production of the colonies could increase to 600 million marks per year, compensating for 15 percent of Germany's import needs.

<h3>British Cotton Industry Plummets: Worst in Ninety Years</h3>
<p>(London) Last year's Lancashire cotton cloth exports were the worst in 90 years. The same is true of cotton yarn exports. Since the cotton famine of 1860, cotton yarn exports have not been as low as last year, except during the European War. According to a report recently published by the Cotton Industry Joint Committee, cotton yarn production decreased by 22 percent compared with 1937, cotton yarn exports decreased by 28 percent, and cotton cloth production decreased by 25 percent. The production of cotton cloth sold in the domestic market has also decreased significantly. In the past year, British cotton cloth trade has only seen an increase in four markets, the most significant of which is Hong Kong, because the trade of Chinese ports has shifted to Hong Kong. The combined number of shipments to China and Hong Kong increased by 18 percent compared with 1937. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Romania's Foreign Policy: Considering Reality and Promoting Peace</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: After the formation of the new cabinet, a proclamation to the nation was issued today, stating, "The new cabinet is composed of the National Renaissance Front and will usher in a new era for the life of the country." The cabinet's foreign policy is to maintain normal relations with all countries, thereby safeguarding the country's security. In short, our country should consider reality and pursue a policy of peace. The alliance treaties previously concluded with friendly countries in Eastern Europe, the Danube River basin, and the Balkan Peninsula should still be adhered to unswervingly. At the same time, we should strive to establish the most practical understanding with Hungary, establish a relationship of trust with Bulgaria, and maintain peaceful and good-neighborly relations with the Soviet Union. In terms of domestic affairs, the principles that the cabinet must vigorously implement are to maintain a balanced budget, oppose devaluing the currency, and prohibit illegal speculation. The cabinet must pay special attention to various economic and agricultural issues. In addition, a Ministry of Minorities will be established to handle the affairs of various minorities, so that each ethnic group can maintain its rights within a framework of faithful cooperation.

<h3>Thirty-One Japanese Arrested in the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Manila) Japanese who used explosives to fish in the seas off Palawan Island in the southwest of the Philippines were chased by Philippine coastal patrols, resulting in the arrest of 31 Japanese. They will be prosecuted under Philippine fishing laws, and are likely to be sentenced to two months in prison or fined 250 pesos. According to the authorities, Japanese ships have repeatedly entered Philippine waters, so Japanese fishermen are being arrested. There have been several cases of Japanese fishing boats fishing in restricted areas outside the Philippines in recent days. On January 19, 26 Japanese opened fire on Philippine troops while stealing timber. After the unexpected incident, the authorities in Luzon requested additional troops. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Fantasy with No Accomplishment; Wu Peifu's Determination Firm; Liang Hongzhi and Others Forced to Visit Wu; Wu Resolutely Rejected All Suggestions</h3>
<p>The Peiping correspondent of the North-China Daily News reported on January 29: Japanese newspapers and news agencies have been filled with the news that Wu Peifu has finally truly emerged from retirement. It is known that the Japanese tend to hope first and then think, so one cannot help but be skeptical about this long-circulated news. But this time the news is slightly different, not that Wu will head a new state or new government, but the more ambiguous position of "Chief Pacification Commissioner" to "pacify" the odious guerrillas in North China. But as of this writing, there is no official confirmation that Wu has accepted any position. Japanese news officials here pre-announced to foreign reporters on Friday, "Be patient, there will be a very important political announcement within 24 hours." But on Sunday, they told foreign reporters that this official statement had been postponed indefinitely. All parties close to Wu firmly deny that Wu has agreed to anything. Liang Hongzhi recently came here and visited Wu with Wang Kemin. It is said that although this move was extremely unwilling to them, they visited Wu under the strong pressure of the Japanese army, urging him to head the new government in North China. Wu resolutely rejected all suggestions. However, Liang and Wang regarded his simple polite remarks expressing his hope that China would restore peace as an implication from Wu to the Japanese that he would accept the position of Pacification Commissioner. The Japanese believe that only Wu can do this work because he "has friendship with the Japanese" and that Wu is respected by his countrymen. However, Wu failed more than ten years ago and has since completely retired from political life, spending his days reciting poems and scriptures. As time flies, the actions of the Japanese army in China over the past eighteen months, even if Wu suddenly changed his original intention, would not be tolerated by most of his compatriots. Wu himself also understands this point. Therefore, judging from the facts, it is clear that one of the main conditions for Wu to work for the Japanese is the complete withdrawal of the Japanese army from North China. He firmly refuses to yield on this condition. If Wu is appointed as "Pacification Commissioner," then those who he needs to pacify are not the drunkards in the commercial ports and large cities of North China, but the guerrillas in various places and the farmers who the Japanese call "spiritual mobilization." Whether Wu emerges from retirement or not, the Japanese army will still not be able to extricate itself. It would be foolish to have extravagant hopes for this matter. Why the Japanese are so anxious to recruit Wu is a more interesting question. There are two explanations. In recent months, a large number of Japanese troops have been transferred from within the pass to Manchuria, so many people believe that the Japanese army is preparing to take an offensive against the Soviet Union in the spring. In order to properly secure their rear, they need some powerful and reliable Chinese to manage North China. But since Japan is already deeply mired in the war in China, to attempt to attack the Soviet Union is hard to believe. Another explanation is based on the domestic situation in Japan and the recent debates in the Diet. The Diet debates severely criticized the government for using troops for 18 months, suffering heavy sacrifices, and achieving nothing. The name of Wu Peifu is well known in Japan. If the Japanese military can induce him at this moment, even if he is only appointed as "Pacification Commissioner," it is better than nothing. At least it may be able to redeem the disappointment of the domestic public.</p>
<h3>Chengdu Suddenly Becomes a Prosperous Market Town; Local Authorities Strive to Eliminate Illiteracy; Bandits on the Sichuan-Kang Border Will Soon Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Sichuan, formerly known as the "Land of Abundance," has now become a base for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Chengdu is the largest metropolis in southwestern China, shielding Kang and Tibet, controlling Yunnan and Guizhou, and truly a crucial stronghold connecting western China. Chengdu and Huayang counties, governed as a single city, stand majestically in the middle of the Min and Tuo rivers, a beautiful plain crisscrossed by numerous canals. Because of its fertile fields, the products are abundant. In the suburbs, many hardworking farmers toil in the verdant fields, making one suspect they are in the Jiangnan region in spring, rather than western Sichuan in the harsh winter.</p>
<p>Population Increases Sharply</p>
<p>In recent years, Chengdu has seen great progress in all material aspects due to the efforts of local authorities in construction. Wide, bright roads are lined with magnificent shops, displaying a vast array of goods, truly having everything one could wish for. The most prosperous Chunxi Road in the city is filled with the noise of vehicles and horses all day long, and the streets are teeming with pedestrians. At night, electric lights shine brightly, as if the city never sleeps. The dazzling neon lights, red and green, illuminate the streets. New-style streamlined cars speed along the roads with a humming sound, and the radio broadcasts various musical melodies. Under the lights, many fashionable women with permed hair and powdered faces constantly rush to work with their purses. The old, gray Chengdu has become thoroughly modern. According to a colleague who spoke to the reporter, the most obvious change in Chengdu since the national crisis is the sharp increase in the number of handsome men and beautiful women on the streets. Most of them are refugees from other provinces. Although there are no precise statistics, the total population of the city is now close to 600,000. Although Chengdu is prosperous, it is a distorted development, because there are still many poor people living in hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Eliminating Illiteracy</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Sichuan Province has been extremely enthusiastic in sending troops to fight the enemy. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers have been sent to the front lines to fight, and the Sichuan army has made heroic sacrifices in several important battles, attracting the attention of the nation. However, it is unavoidable that the majority of the general public have not thoroughly understood the situation. For example, in Chengdu alone, there are particularly many illiterate people. According to a recent survey by the municipal government, the total number of illiterate people in the city is 250,000. The government is now implementing a pre-planned, phased, compulsory education program in order to eliminate illiteracy as soon as possible. The newspaper industry in Chengdu has sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain in recent years, showing a vigorous and flourishing trend. The daily newspapers with two large sheets are the Fuxing Daily, Huaxi Daily, and Xingzhong Daily. The daily newspapers with one large sheet are the New China Daily and the Jianguo Daily and Dangjun Daily, which were founded on New Year's Day this year. The daily newspaper with one and a half sheets is the Xinxin News, which has the largest circulation. In addition, the small newspapers with one or two sheets are the Xinmin News, Kuai Bao, Jie Bao, and Sichuan Daily. The evening newspapers include the Xinwen Yebao, Minsheng Bao Wan Kan, and Shishi Xin Kan. There is also the Guonan Sanri Kan, which publishes one medium-sized sheet every three days. In total, there are fifteen large and small newspapers. Except for the Dangjun Daily, which uses newsprint, all the newspapers are printed on Sichuan native paper. The major newspapers in Chongqing have a considerable circulation in Chengdu. The news agencies include the Chengdu branch of the Central News Agency, the News Translation Agency, and the Chuan Kang, Shuguang, Minsheng, and Chengdu News agencies. In addition, the National Revolutionary Society has recently sent people to establish a branch here, which will soon begin distributing news.</p>
<p>Deng Xihou Speaks</p>
<p>General Deng Xihou, the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan and Kang, is stationed in Chengdu. The reporter visited his private residence at 9:00 a.m. on the fourth. Deng's residence is a new-style Western-style house on Guiwangqiao East Street in the city. The living room is downstairs, a very large room. The reporter was led in by the adjutant. Director Deng is about fifty years old, wearing a gray cloth coat, with a dignified manner. After exchanging greetings, the reporter explained his intention to investigate Kang and asked for protection. Deng readily agreed and immediately instructed his adjutant to expedite the issuance of certification documents. The reporter expressed his gratitude. Then, they discussed the security of Sichuan and Kang. Deng said that the local situation was generally peaceful, with only small groups of bandits in remote counties, which were being vigorously suppressed and would soon be eliminated. Later, they discussed the conscription problem in Sichuan. Deng said very seriously that Sichuan lacked the objective conditions for conscription. Most of the people had not received adequate education and did not understand the meaning of conscription. The personnel handling the conscription had also failed to follow the regulations of the Ministry of Interior and conduct the process peacefully. In the future, if the process could be handled peacefully, unexpected incidents would not occur. At this point, the reporter, knowing that Director Deng was preparing to fly to Chongqing by plane and was very busy, did not want to take up too much of his time and took his leave.</p>
<h3>Chinese Guerrilla Force Attacks Luoshe Railway Station at Night</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Luoshe Railway Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway was originally garrisoned by a Japanese unit of about thirty soldiers. The station was surrounded by electric fences because it had been attacked by Chinese guerrilla forces in the past, so the security was extremely tight. However, at about 11:00 p.m. on the sixth, about 200 soldiers from the Gao Zugao unit of the First Brigade of the Third War Zone, stationed in the village, took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and attacked the station in three directions. The eastern route was the main force. Before setting off, they first destroyed about thirty meters of the railway tracks at the eastern and western ends. When they were 100 meters away from the station, the two sides began a fierce battle. In the darkness, the Japanese soldiers, seeing the sudden arrival of the guerrillas and hearing gunfire from all sides, fired machine guns and small mortars in all directions, consuming a lot of ammunition. The Chinese army, seeing the Japanese army firing wildly, lay down in the fields. The Japanese army, seeing that there was no more gunfire, thought that the guerrillas had retreated and jumped out of their trenches, intending to pursue. Unexpectedly, the Chinese army had approached the station in an instant, and the gunfire erupted again. Seeing this situation, the Japanese soldiers panicked and retreated westward. The Chinese army then rushed into the platform, occupied all the Japanese barracks in the station, and captured twelve rifles, one small mortar, three boxes of ammunition, one Japanese flag, and countless other military supplies. A total of eleven Japanese soldiers were killed. On the Chinese side, four were killed and twenty-three were wounded. Later, the Japanese army from Shitangwan received the news and came to support. The Chinese army, having achieved its objective, retreated with the captured spoils of war. The Japanese army, seeing that the Chinese army had retreated, did not pursue. It is learned that the actual number of Japanese soldiers killed in this battle was thirteen, and eight were wounded, including two who were seriously injured. Six of the wounded Japanese soldiers were sent to Wuxi for treatment at about 10:00 a.m. yesterday (the seventh). As for the railway tracks destroyed by the Chinese, they were repaired that night.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders the Canal Engineering Bureau to Repair the Dangerous Sections of the Canal Dikes and Dredge the Zhongshan River to Ensure Smooth Drainage</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday ordered the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, stating roughly: "Spring is approaching, and it is less than 100 days before the Yellow River's peach blossom flood. The waterlogged areas in this province are now focusing on drainage work, and the planning for future disasters is even more urgent. It has been found that for the low-lying and damaged sections of the canal dikes, estimates have been prepared and submitted separately, requesting funding for construction from the disaster relief funds. However, due to the large number of projects and the large amount of funds required, the central government has not yet allocated the funds. If we do not take advantage of this winter and spring slack season to quickly find ways to start construction, we fear that it will be too late to deal with any emergencies during the flood season. It is hereby ordered that the Director of the Bureau shall, in accordance with the above, quickly survey and estimate the amount of earthwork required to raise and thicken the canal dikes, as well as the quantity of soil needed for the dangerous sections along the dikes, and submit a plan for approval. The relevant county governments shall be instructed to recruit labor and carry out the work in advance to protect the dikes. The silted and shallow sections of the Zhongshan River shall also be surveyed and estimated as soon as possible, and the counties along the river shall be ordered to levy labor to carry out the dredging work to ensure a smooth passage to the sea. For other special engineering projects that cannot be handled by levied labor, the instructions in Order No. 3020 issued by this government on December 2, 1938, shall still be followed, and estimates shall be prepared and submitted separately for approval. There shall be no delay. If disaster relief funds can be approved in the future, other arrangements will be made. You are hereby informed." In addition, the opening and closing of the dams leading to the sea have established regulations, which are different from ordinary drainage gates. The water level stored at the Yu Matou Zhi in Gaoyou is now lower than the historical levels for damming. The spring water at the Cheluo Dam is only a few inches deep and is about to stop flowing. The amount of water discharged from the Xin Dam is also minimal. Furthermore, the Canal Engineering Bureau has been ordered to send personnel to secretly investigate and dredge the dams leading to the Yangtze River to ensure smooth passage to the sea. As the amount of water discharged has increased, there is no reason to prevent the planned sequential damming and closing of the Che and Xin Dams. To avoid disaster, it is important to block the breach in the Yellow River. We have repeatedly appealed to the central government to quickly plan the blockage. We also telegraphed on behalf of Huang, the county magistrate of Huaian, to the county magistrates of Bao Ying and Huaiyin, instructing them to inform the people of their respective counties to comply.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Xiyi Road; Japanese Planes Bomb Heqiao</h3>
<p>Wuxi Special Correspondence: Since the outbreak of war in Yixing and Changxing, and the recapture of Heqiao by the Chinese army, the situation on the Xiyi Road has become serious, in addition to the dispatch of 1,000 Japanese soldiers from here to provide support. The Japanese army is gathered in Caoqiao, Panjiaqiao, and the Meiyuan area of ​​this county, with strict security. Dushanmen in Taihu Lake prohibits the passage of ships. At about 1:00 p.m. on the seventh, three Japanese planes flew over this county and headed towards Yixing. At about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the reporter witnessed four Japanese motorboats carrying about eighty wounded soldiers, all bandaged, heading north from the Taihu Lake. This morning, the reporter received news from Changzhou that the Chinese army in Heqiao had withdrawn from the town at dawn on the seventh due to the threat of Japanese planes and heavy artillery. The battle in Yixing was quite fierce, the city gates were closed, and the Chinese army had the upper hand. However, Japanese reinforcements had arrived, and Changxing was still under siege. However, according to news from a certain Chinese guerrilla force in Taihu Lake, Heqiao was still occupied by the Chinese army, but both sides suffered heavy casualties. Japanese planes were constantly bombing, and many houses in the market were on fire.</p>

<h3>Thirty Thousand Guerrillas Cross the Yangtze River; the Situation in Hangzhou is Urgent; the Japanese Army is Building Fortifications in Hangzhou; Haining has been Recaptured by the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>The Dalu Bao reported: "Yesterday (the seventh), the Japanese-language Dalu Xinbao reported that the Japanese garrison in Hangzhou will build defensive fortifications around the city to make it difficult to breach even under attack from all sides. The surrounding lakes and mountains, combined with the defensive fortifications, will 'completely protect Hangzhou and increase its strategic importance.'" According to Chinese sources in this port, more than 30,000 Chinese guerrillas have crossed the Qiantang River in the past three weeks. After the Chinese army recaptured Haining, northeast of Hangzhou, the situation in northern Zhejiang has become tense again. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Road is threatened by Chinese mobile units, and this land transportation line can be cut off at any time. At the same time, it is rumored that guerrilla warfare is taking place in the suburbs of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other towns. The regular forces of the 62nd and 63rd divisions of the Chinese army have been sent to the Jiaxing area, launching an offensive against the city in three directions.</p>
<h3>The Money Trade Association Announced Yesterday: Total Closing to be Handled; Last Month's Discount Rate was 3.5%; the Executive Committee Meeting Will be Held Tomorrow; All Industries are Well-Prepared, and There is No Worry of Passing the Year-End Safely</h3>
<p>The end of the Republic of China 27th year is approaching. The Money Trade Association yesterday announced the handling of the total closing, announced the discount rate for January, and decided to convene an Executive Committee meeting tomorrow. After the war, Shanghai's financial situation stabilized, and the discount rate yesterday fell to 9%. All industries have seen abnormal development, and there is no worry of passing the year-end safely. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association Announces Total Closing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association issued a notice stating: "Dear Sirs, Regarding the proposal of the 40th meeting of the 3rd session of the members' representatives on the handling of business before and after the total closing of the 27th year, the following resolutions have been made: 1. The total closing date for the 27th year is set for February 18th. 2. Interest issues before the total closing: the deposit interest up to February 13th will be 3 yuan, and the overdue interest after the 13th will be added. However, the reserve interest will be calculated until the total closing date. 3. The time for collecting bills on the total closing date: on the 18th, the time for mutual collection of bills in the market is until 4 p.m. After that time, each bank will collect from each other, with a limit of 6 p.m. 4. The date the market discount rate will be open until: open until February 17th. The above four items have been recorded in the minutes after being resolved by the entire body. Correspondingly, the case is recorded and notified, and it is hoped that it will be complied with. Respectfully addressed to all member banks."</p>
<p>The Executive Committee Meeting Will be Convened Tomorrow</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the member banks of the Money Trade Association have all complied with it. As the total closing date is approaching in a blink of an eye, the association has specifically scheduled an Executive Committee meeting to be held at the association on Ningbo Road at 2 p.m. tomorrow to gather and discuss all the preparatory matters before the total closing. It is also decided to have a four-day holiday starting from February 19th to sort out everything, and to go public on February 23rd. All money banks that go public must report to the market on the morning of that day. Regarding the reorganization and replacement of managers of each bank, it must also be reported to the association before going public. The market discount rate for January has been resolved by the association to be 3.5 yuan and was announced on the market yesterday as "the discount rate for January is 3 yuan and 5 jiao, and overdue interest will be added." Due to the financial stability of Shanghai, the market discount rate fell to 9 points yesterday.</p>
<p>Adequate Preparation for a Safe Passage</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from all sectors yesterday that Shanghai is the commercial center of the country and the distribution center for import and export goods. After the war, factories and shops outside the concession suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the war. However, factories and shops within the concession have experienced abnormal development because factories in the war zone were destroyed, production was reduced, and transportation in Shanghai gradually recovered. Therefore, the factories within the concession have all developed abnormally, and the goods produced are in greater demand than supply. The original inventory has all been sold out, and the factories have had no choice but to sell futures. The prices of all goods have soared, especially raw silk, cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, and knitwear. After the total closing of each industry, it is expected that they will all make a profit. Therefore, each industry will definitely be able to pass this year's year-end safely. The current stable situation in the financial market is beyond everyone's expectations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy in Yantai Detains Two More British Ships; Released Only After Six Hours</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Damei Wanbao, the Japanese navy continues its policy of obstructing the shipping of various countries and yesterday (the seventh) detained the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ships "Ming Niu" and "De Sheng" in Yantai for six hours before releasing them. The reason for the detention is still unclear, but it is generally believed that the Japanese side wanted to review the passenger lists. The two ships were originally scheduled to leave Yantai at 6 p.m. yesterday but were detained and did not set sail until midnight. The Ming Sheng ship sailed to Tianjin, and the De Sheng ship sailed from Yantai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th. It is generally believed that a formal investigation of this matter has now been launched.</p>
<h3>Domestic Debt: Drawing Lots for Principal Repayment as Usual</h3>
<p>Unified Class A Increases to Twenty-Four; Railway Construction Public Bonds to be Drawn on Schedule</p>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance continues to draw lots for the repayment of domestic debt. The National Debt Fund Management Committee, following the Ministry's order, will draw lots tomorrow for three types of bonds, including Unified Class A and Railway Construction. According to the lottery for the repayment of principal for Unified Public Bonds Class A, the bond tickets with the same last three digits will be the winning bond tickets. The number of tickets to be drawn has been increased to twenty-four this time. According to the lottery for the repayment of principal for the first and second issues of Railway Construction Public Bonds, the bond tickets with the same last two digits will be the winning bond tickets. Five tickets will be drawn for each. The rumor that the lottery for the repayment of principal for Railway Construction Public Bonds has been suspended is not true.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Rental Prices Approved for Increase</h3>
<p>In order to develop the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society, the Public Concession's Gong Bu Ju has notified rickshaw owners that the mutual aid society fee will be restored to 1.5 yuan per vehicle this month (1 yuan last month). Because the prices of hardware materials have soared, the industry association believes that the original rental price of 7.5 jiao per day is difficult to maintain, so they requested an increase in the rental price. The Gong Bu Ju agreed to consider an increase. This month, the rental price per vehicle per day will be increased to 7.7 jiao to avoid losses for rickshaw owners. The rickshaw owners have already decided through a meeting to notify all rickshaw owners to comply.</p>
<h3>More Than Two Thousand Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported Back to Japan</h3>
<p>Since China launched a full-scale guerrilla war, the Japanese army has been attacked from time to time, and deaths and injuries have been frequently reported. Recently, due to the sharp increase in wounded soldiers, hospitals have been overcrowded and unable to accommodate them. Therefore, more than two thousand wounded Japanese soldiers were sent back to Japan for treatment yesterday morning. They boarded a transport ship at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou and were shipped out of the country.</p>
<h3>Chinese Sympathizers Found in Japanese Armory</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily on the 8th, a dispatch from Tokyo reports that the Ministry of Home Affairs recently issued a circular strictly ordering national police agencies to pay attention to the activities of Chinese spies. It is reported that the contents of the Ministry's order stated that some Japanese people had been bought by the Chinese side to enter various military factories under false names to obtain information, and that considerable clues had been obtained in this matter. Therefore, the police were ordered to strictly guard against "Japanese traitors."</p>
<h3>After Shelling, Japanese Warships Depart; Order Restored in Dinghai; Damage to Datou and the Eastern Suburbs More Severe; Traffic Between Ningbo and Dinghai Resumed</h3>
<p>Dinghai again experienced an incident on the 5th of this month in which Japanese warships shelled the shore, but the damage was still light. Business firms in this port with origins in Dinghai have obtained detailed reports of this incident. Extracts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Current Situation in Dinghai</p>
<p>Since the "January 28th" incident in Dinghai, the conflict between the Dinghai Marine Police and the guest army (Chuansha Guerrilla Force) was fortunately mediated by officials and gentry, and the danger was averted. Order has been fully restored. However, recently, shipments from Shanghai to Dinghai have been prohibited. The commercial market in the county is no longer what it used to be. The year is fading, and the situation is bleak.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Enter</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 12:00 noon on the 5th of this month, three Japanese warships (belonging to the Fourth Fleet) suddenly broke into Zhushanmen (i.e., the Dinghai port) and sailed to Datou Jiangxin to anchor. They then lowered a small motorboat and drove towards the shore, trying to seize various sailing ships moored on the Datou side.</p>
<p>Shelling Day and Night</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, the sailing ships fled in all directions, so the Japanese motorboat gained nothing. After firing machine guns at the sailing ships, it returned to the Japanese warship. At that time, the first of the three Japanese warships intermittently fired more than twenty shells at the shore, and fired more than twenty shells again in the evening. The Japanese warships did not leave until 10:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<p>Damage Investigation</p>
<p>After the incident, an investigation revealed that there were many bullet hits in the Datou vicinity. For example, the Tongshoutai Sauce Garden and the Yangchun Pavilion snack shop were completely destroyed. When the Japanese warships docked in Jiangxin, the residents and shopkeepers in the neighborhood all fled, so the casualties were only one hawker (who had died). In addition, the Dongyue Temple in the eastern suburbs of the county seat was also completely destroyed by artillery shells, with no casualties.</p>
<p>Libao Searched</p>
<p>The Libao ship, which travels between Dinghai and Ningbo, left Dinghai for Ningbo at 7:00 a.m. on the 6th. At that time, the Japanese warships were still anchored in Jiangxin, so they were intercepted. Six Japanese naval officers boarded the ship for inspection. Because they found nothing, they were released. Traffic between Ningbo and Dinghai has now returned to normal, and order has been fully restored.</p>
<p>Telegram Inquires About Tranquility</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, the Dinghai Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai was extremely concerned and immediately sent a telegram to inquire. A wireless reply was received yesterday, stating that the Japanese warships had left Dinghai at noon on the 6th and that order in the county seat was restored that day. Traffic between Ningbo and Dinghai is still carried out by the Libao ship, while the Tianbao has long since been rerouted to the Shen (Jiamen)-Dinghai line. Please rest assured, etc.</p>
<p>Speculation on Causes</p>
<p>According to gentry and merchants from Dinghai in Shanghai, there are two reasons for the sudden shelling of Dinghai by Japanese warships this time. One is that their goal is to seize the profits of the Zhoushan Islands' blackfish for a long time, but the fishermen there have a spirit of non-cooperation. Another is that recently, guerrilla forces fighting in the Chuansha area passed through Dinghai, and the local authorities warmly welcomed them. This was also something that a certain party was dissatisfied with, so they took this threatening and senseless action.</p>
<p>Fish Products Awaiting Transport</p>
<p>It is also learned that Dinghai has an accumulation of fish products, which urgently need to be sold in Shanghai. Dinghai fish merchants requested Commander Guo of the Ningbo Garrison Department to dispatch three ships, Hai Fu, Hana, and Gaodeng, for transportation. It is now learned that the Garrison Department only agreed to transport one ship and that it must be approved by Commander Liu of a certain group army before it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>British Merchant Ship "New Peking" Rerouted to Shanghai-Ningbo; First Voyage to Ningbo Scheduled for the 15th</h3>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's largest merchant ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the "New Peking," was rerouted to North China due to obstructed waterways after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War. It is learned that the Zhejiang Provincial authorities have approved ships traveling to Ningbo to enter Ningbo directly. Therefore, the company has already transferred the "New Peking" back to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It has now been scheduled to resume direct flights to Ningbo for the first time starting on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Forces Everywhere; Their Momentum is Increasing Daily; Deng's Troops Annihilated the Japanese Army in Wangting; Many of the Puppet Troops in Nantong Turned Against and Defected</h3>
<p>Wangting</p>
<p>Deng Benyin's troops, who serve as the guerrilla commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai line in Jiangnan, number about four to five thousand and are scattered between Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, actively attacking the Japanese army in all directions. On February 6, several hundred men of the Yang Xiangqi's unit of the Third Special Service Battalion of the aforementioned troops engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army at Daqiangdou, Wangting, Suzhou, lasting for four to five hours. Yang's troops, with meticulous deployment of forces beforehand, lured the Japanese army into an encirclement and then subjected them to a severe annihilation. They attacked from all sides, front, back, left, and right. The Japanese army's formation was thrown into chaos as they fled eastward and westward, attempting to break through. As a result, more than twenty people were killed or injured under the intensive machine-gun fire of the Chinese army. The rest fled back to Wangting Station. Later, Japanese reinforcements arrived to rescue them, but the Chinese army had accomplished its mission and withdrew safely.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>The Soviet Northern Guerrilla Force, after being reorganized by the commander of the × Tiger District, Gu Zhutong, and with the dispatch of regular troops to participate, is growing in momentum. According to a person from Nantong yesterday, three hundred Japanese and puppet troops departed from Nantong City a few days ago, causing disturbances in the surrounding villages. The people of each village, fearing their lasciviousness, fled to take refuge. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese and puppet troops arrived in Jinsha Town, they were caught off guard by the Chinese army and subjected to an attack. The market troops in each nearby town also reportedly rushed to provide support and launched an offensive. The Japanese and puppet troops were outnumbered and abandoned their guns to escape. The three Japanese soldiers who did not manage to escape from the town were captured, and a part of the puppet troops turned against and defected, shouting slogans such as "Drive out the Japanese army," "Long live the Republic of China," and "Long live Chairman Chiang."</p>

<h3>How to Complete Marital Love</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>To prevent cracks in marital love and ensure a happy family life, one must pay close attention to reproductive function. The key is to ensure a joyful married life and lasting satisfaction for both partners. This requires premarital knowledge, and most importantly, good reproductive health after marriage.</p>
<p>In the past, people used various methods to restrain those who indulged in excessive and immoral behavior through moral or intellectual means. Simply put, it was so-called "post-marital hygiene" because it provided a model for men and women after marriage to achieve healthy reproduction and a long and happy life.</p>
<p>Excessive indulgence is harmful to both men and women. Women are prone to palpitations, uterine congestion, and endometritis, which can lead to infertility in the future. Men are more likely to suffer from sexual neurasthenia, such as spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, and impotence, making it difficult to strive in active society.</p>
<p>Reproduction is a major fact of life and an integral part of our daily lives, so it must be fully healthy, as it is indeed the foundation of "family happiness" and "marital love." A happy family life is one of life's greatest joys. The atmosphere within the family should be spiritual and ethereal, but its foundation, the issue of reproduction, should be based on biological or scientific facts.</p>
<p>To complete marital love, one must first eliminate kidney deficiency and impotence, which hinder reproductive function. If left untreated, not only will marital love be impossible, but the condition will spread throughout the body, leading to pale complexion, muscle weakness, headaches, mental lethargy, forgetfulness, and insomnia. Therefore, early treatment is essential. Modern medicine has invented endocrine therapy that can completely cure this condition. Taking "Buti Kang," a male-specific endocrine preparation made from the testicles of strong animals, can quickly eliminate premature ejaculation and impotence, restore healthy sexual function, and prevent premature decline. It also invigorates the brain, promotes the function of metabolism, strengthens muscles, and improves complexion. This agent works comprehensively, generating sperm and replenishing the kidneys within 24 hours, making its efficacy superior to all other endocrine drugs. The female version of Buti Kang is a genuine ovarian preparation with the power to regulate menstruation and promote fertility.</p>
<h3>A Good Medicine for Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Everyone fears tuberculosis, but before it becomes tuberculosis, everyone tends to be careless. Coughing is easily overlooked, but it is often a precursor to pulmonary tuberculosis. If you want to prevent tuberculosis, you must first treat coughs, and the most reliable treatment for coughs and tuberculosis prevention, in my experience of twenty-seven or eight years, is Germany's "Bufei Na'er." Regardless of the cause of the cough, or asthma that prevents restful sleep, taking "Bufei Na'er" can stop the cough within three hours and absolutely prevent it from developing into pulmonary tuberculosis. Those who have already entered various stages of pulmonary tuberculosis can also be cured in a short period of time by taking this agent.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Kidney Deficiency Caused by Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Why it Affects the Kidneys. How does gonorrhea affect the kidneys? Aren't the kidneys far from the external genitalia? This is because people do not understand the ability of gonococci to escape and their path to communicate with the external genitalia. It turns out that our kidneys have ureters that connect to the bladder, so if there is bladder inflammation or ureter inflammation, there is a high probability of developing gonococcal nephritis or pyelonephritis. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the treatment of gonorrhea. A slight oversight can weaken the kidneys, leading to serious consequences. Therefore, we must prevent patients with gonococcal cystitis from developing ureteritis, because if this secondary condition develops, their reproductive future will be severely threatened, and kidney excretion will also be disrupted. This is something that general doctors do not pay attention to.</p>
<p>How to Avoid This Crisis. How can we avoid this crisis? If we can eliminate cystitis, nephritis will not develop. The wise prevent problems before they occur. Patients who have not yet developed cystitis must use quick surgery and effective drugs to treat it thoroughly. Only then can they be cured safely. Based on my twenty years of experience, for gonococcal cystitis, ureteritis, and nephritis, I first use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy interchangeably, and then use the gonorrhea panacea "Kelin Nong" as an oral medication. The oral medication can induce the body to produce anti-gonococcal phagocytic action, while static electricity therapy can penetrate and kill gonococci. These complementary methods enhance each other's effects. Therefore, kidney deficiency caused by gonorrhea can be quickly cured. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 consultation numbers will be given out each day, with a registration fee of only 5 jiao per number.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>Can Leukorrhea Not Be Cured Permanently?</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The claim that leukorrhea cannot be cured permanently is a complete deception! To say that it can be cured in three to five days is even more deceptive!</p>
<p>Can gonorrhea really not be cured permanently? In fact, it can be cured. To cure gonorrhea permanently, you must start by eliminating its root cause. The faster the treatment, the greater the benefit, and the faster the cure. If you delay, the virus will penetrate deeper. How can you expect it to be cured in the shortest amount of time? However, this only says that gonorrhea is difficult to cure permanently in a short period of time. It does not say that it is necessarily incurable. However, I often see gonorrhea patients who are anxious because their condition cannot be cured immediately. General over-the-counter medicines cater to their desires, claiming that a certain medicine can completely cure the condition within three to five days. Therefore, gonorrhea patients choose the goal without choosing the means, rushing to take them. As a result, they often fail to achieve their expected goal and are disappointed, or even worse than before the illness. This is because they do not know the truth about gonorrhea, which is why they make such mistakes. Because there is no such thing as a magical oral medicine for gonorrhea in the world. It is possible to cure gonorrhea permanently, and it is also possible to cure gonorrhea in a short period of time. But you must remember that all treatments must be scientific to be effective. Otherwise, there will be absolutely no effect. This is the result of my many years of experience.</p>
<p>In my experience, the one that best meets our ideal goal is "Kelin Nong," a gonorrhea panacea invented by the German gonorrhea expert Dr. Peter. This agent is the crystallization of the doctor's lifelong efforts, made with a mixture of protein and yellow pigment. After thousands of actual tests and improvements, and distribution to famous venereal disease hospitals in various countries for testing, it has been gradually improved to perfection. It is very different from the crudely made over-the-counter medicines that claim this year's medicine is the newest gonorrhea medicine, and next year's new medicine is outdated. General new medicines have no standard, while "Kelin Nong" is ever new. All new and old leukorrhea cannot be cured permanently without "Kelin Nong." Furthermore, taking "Kelin Nong" can completely cure the condition in three to five weeks. This is the most reasonable way to cure gonorrhea permanently in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Cannot Be Treated Blindly</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>When young people are developing, they have sexual impulses due to the natural stimulation of the hormone HORMONE. Those with weak wills often cannot control themselves, leading to masturbation. Masturbation easily becomes a habit, and the prostate becomes overexcited, leading to sexual neurasthenia, such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development. After prolonged nocturnal emission, mental power declines. The person will feel headaches, forgetfulness, tinnitus, and insomnia. They will be unable to perform mental work and experience drastic changes in emotions, becoming irritable and unpredictable. In severe cases, they often have a negative attitude and develop suicidal impulses.</p>
<p>In addition to masturbation and indulgence, this condition can also be caused by excessive physical and mental fatigue, such as working day and night, thinking about things, doing things beyond one's ability, or taking on an excessive amount of responsibility, and walking long distances.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, the first thing is to abstain from masturbation, and especially not to treat it blindly. "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets," a German special medicine for treatment, is the most effective. For those with neurasthenia and severe loss of sexual power, taking the formulation "Buti Kang" will cure the condition.</p>
<h3>Key to Curing Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The lung is an insensitive organ, so it is unaware of being invaded by tubercle bacilli. Even if cavities form due to erosion, there is no specific pain. Only when tubercle bacilli affect the pleura and cause pleurisy will there be a stabbing pain in the chest, or the chest cavity will accumulate water due to pleurisy, or death will occur due to tuberculous meningitis. Therefore, the key to curing pulmonary tuberculosis is on the one hand to increase resistance, and more importantly to take "Bufei Na'er," an effective medicine for lung disease invented by the German Dr. Tumei, to increase calcium in the lungs and kill tubercle bacilli. As a result, lung disease, no matter what stage it reaches, can be completely cured. Therefore, it is no coincidence that "Bufei Na'er" is popular in various countries.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Still Have No Instructions for Evacuating Foreigners from Kuling. British and American Vice-Consuls Went to Xun Yesterday by Ship. It is Difficult to Evacuate Foreigners Before the Deadline. It is Said That the Japanese Reply Has Agreed to Extend the Deadline.</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Japanese notified foreigners in Kuling on February 1st that they must all evacuate Kuling before February 10th. The deadline for the evacuation will expire tomorrow. The relevant consulates in this port have not received instructions from the governments of the respective countries regarding whether their nationals should prepare to evacuate, so they cannot make a decision. However, it is understood that the foreigners trapped in Kuling responded to the Japanese in writing last Friday, agreeing to consider the Japanese deadline for evacuation, but the British, American, and Norwegian consuls believe that the foreigners residing in Kuling are all close to the age of knowing their fate and are physically weak and unable to withstand the severe winter and extremely cold weather. It is difficult to evacuate before the deadline. However, they have learned that the Japanese have carried out large-scale bombings around Kuling, which may affect the foreigners in Kuling, so they have jointly notified the Japanese to pay attention to their safety. It is reported that the British gunboat "Cricket" (625 tons) will sail to the Kuling area in advance to visit the foreigners in the mountains. Another American gunboat, "Oahu," also carried British Vice-Consul Mr. MacTaggart and American Vice-Consul Mr. Davis from Hankou to Xun yesterday morning. According to reports, the two vice-consuls will contact the foreigners in Kuling to discuss the evacuation.</p>
<p>According to Xiandai News Agency, after the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, notified the British, American, German, and Norwegian consuls in Shanghai in writing that the Japanese had ordered foreigners residing in Kuling to evacuate before February 10th, the British Consul-General replied to the Japanese that it was difficult for the British authorities in Hankou to contact the foreigners in Kuling, and that evacuation was difficult and would take time, so the deadline of February 10th was impossible. He requested that the Japanese extend the date to allow sufficient preparation. It is understood that the Japanese have considered this and agreed to extend the deadline, hoping that the authorities of various countries will quickly contact the foreigners in Kuling to avoid repeated delays. The Japanese reply was sent to the consulates of various countries by the Japanese Consul-General Miura yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>The Refugee Relief Association Approves One Day of Disaster Relief. Held on January 5th of the Old Calendar. Advance Announcements in Newspapers and Public Announcements to All Sectors.</h3>
<p>The Solicitation Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association previously approved the proposal of Mr. Ying Yongjun, a citizen, to hold a "Citizens' One-Day Relief Campaign." After formulating implementation measures, it sent a letter to the association for approval. It is now understood that the association has approved the Refugee Relief Association's reply, stating that the "Citizens' One-Day Relief Campaign" proposal transferred by Mr. Ying Yongjun is feasible and approved for implementation. A corresponding reply is sent, and it is hoped that it will be forwarded to Mr. Ying to express gratitude on behalf of the association. The association has formulated the following measures for the Citizens' One-Day Relief Campaign: (1) Date: The "Citizens' One-Day Relief Campaign" is scheduled to be held on February 23rd, which is January 5th of the old calendar. (2) Goals: The solicitation goals of the "Citizens' One-Day Relief Campaign" are: 1. One day's profit, 2. One day's salary, 3. One day's savings, 4. New Year's wine donation, 5. New Year's money donation. (3) Announcement: The association will publish the significance and measures of the "Citizens' One-Day Relief Campaign" in newspapers in advance, and ask various radio stations to promote it on its behalf, so as to achieve great results. (4) Collection: One-day campaign donations should be sent to the association by all sectors or notified to the association to send personnel to collect them. (5) Credit: The one-day campaign donations collected by the association will be published in newspapers and included in the credit record to show honesty.</p>
<p>Theater Performances by Various Hometown Associations to Raise Funds. The Solicitation Committee of the Hometown Association Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association previously resolved to raise funds through recreational performances, which will be held separately by various hometown associations. The first to hold the event was the Pudong Hometown Association, which invited the Wenbin Theater Troupe to perform, raising more than 3,000 yuan in ticket revenue, which has been sent to the association. The Shaoxing Seven Townships Shanghai Hometown Association also invited famous Yue Opera actresses from all over Shanghai to perform for two days starting on the 13th at the Golden Grand Theater. The programs have all been arranged and are very valuable. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. In addition, the Solicitation Committee of the Citizens' Group of the association received a donation of 100 yuan in national currency from the Huizhong Bank yesterday.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army Plans to Raise 40,000. Although the Salvation Army's relief donations for this year started last Monday, as of yesterday, a total of 18,522 yuan has been received. Yesterday afternoon, there were still continuous donations. The Salvation Army's total fundraising target is 40,000 yuan, which will be used entirely for relief work for Chinese and foreigners in this city. The donations are collected by the army's temporary headquarters at No. 57 Nanjing Road. The largest donation received yesterday was from a French charity, totaling 2,400 yuan. HSBC also donated 1,500 yuan, and Yizhong Tobacco Company also donated 1,000 yuan. The army's biggest burden in this city is maintaining 43,000 refugees, who live in refugee camps run by the Salvation Army. In addition to providing food and clothing, each camp has hospital and school facilities. Those who want to know about the Salvation Army's work are welcome to visit the camps. At present, most of the donations are from foreigners and foreign organizations. The Salvation Army Commander Maurice and the fundraising supervisor believe that hundreds of Chinese friends and organizations will soon donate generously to help them succeed. The army's work for foreigners is actually smaller than that for Chinese, such as helping the poor and sick, relieving refugees, and running education for refugee children. There are more than six Chinese people in the army's advisory group. The army hopes that Chinese people can donate generously.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs' Tax Revenue Decreased by 800,000 Yuan in January, Due to a Sharp Decline in Import, Export, and Transit Taxes in Various Places.</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs' tax revenue has suddenly decreased sharply in recent months. There is no surplus available except for paying off debts. In November of last year, it even overdrafted a customs surplus of 2 million yuan. The Japanese previously used the excuse of delaying the payment of customs duties to guarantee foreign debts of various countries. The crux of the problem lies in this. It is understood that the customs revenue in January has not improved. Compared with last month, it decreased by about 800,000 yuan. The reason is that the New Year's relationship, the import, export, and transit tax revenue in various places has decreased sharply, and the expansion of the guerrilla war zones in the interior and the obstruction of transportation are also important reasons.</p>
<h3>Deping Sailed to Ningbo with a Guarantee System. Transporting Dinghai Fish and Seafood. The Defense Department Has Approved It.</h3>
<p>After the direct Shanghai-Ningbo route resumed, Deping sailed to Ningbo yesterday, implementing a passenger guarantee system. After the suspension of the Dinghai livelihood, the fish merchants petitioned and were approved by the Ningbo Defense Commander to send a bay boat to load fish and seafood. It will be implemented after approval by the × Group Army. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deping Ende Sailed to Ningbo Yesterday. The Ningbo Defense Commander notified that all ships specially approved to travel on the direct Shanghai-Ningbo route must adopt a passenger guarantee system. The Italian ship Deping of the Sino-Italian Company set sail directly from Shanghai to Ningbo at 3:00 PM yesterday, adopting the passenger guarantee system for the first time. In addition to a local reliable guarantor, the guarantee system also requires two 2.5-inch photos of the person. Ende also set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo at 4:00 PM yesterday, loading coal from the Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory and heading directly to Ningbo.</p>
<p>Approval to Sail to Dinghai to Load Fish and Seafood. The Dinghai County Chamber of Commerce and the Fishermen's Association, etc., in order to clear the fish production, requested permission for the Harner, Haifu, and Gaodeng to also bay at Dinghai to load fish and seafood, and sent representatives Zhang Junrong, Li Xuefan, Che Meitang, etc. to Ningbo to petition the Ningbo Defense Commander. It is said that Commander Guo has agreed to temporarily use a bay boat to load fish and seafood, but it will be implemented after it is submitted to the headquarters of the × Group Army for approval. The fish merchants decided to send the above three ships to travel to Dinghai in turn.</p>
<h3>Private Smuggling Exports Increase, Copper Coins Lack. Three Banks Issued 500,000 Coins. The Market Still Does Not Have Enough Change.</h3>
<p>Dengshi copper coins are smuggled for export, and circulation in the market is almost non-existent. It is particularly lacking in business for finding change. Although 500,000 one-cent copper coins have been transported to Shanghai in the past month and issued by the Central, China, and Transportation Banks for circulation, it is still not enough. Taking the income from tram and public bus tickets as an example, copper coins used to be the majority, but not now. The copper coins from ticket sales are not enough to give change. This shows how severe the lack of copper coins is.</p>
<h3>The Italian Father in Laohekou Has No Suspicion of Espionage. All Suspicions and Charges Withdrawn. Italian Personnel Are Satisfied.</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, several Italian fathers were arrested by the Chinese authorities in the interior at the end of last year on suspicion of being Japanese spies. It is rumored that their personal belongings, such as radios allegedly used to send telegrams, were confiscated. It is now understood that they have been released and the charges against them have been withdrawn. The Italian Embassy issued the following announcement: "A Shanghai newspaper published news about the resolution of the accidental incident at the Italian church in Laohekou. The Italian Embassy raised objections to this matter. Now this regrettable situation has been resolved. All suspicions and charges have been withdrawn. Italian personnel are satisfied with this. Although no one decided to denigrate the Catholic authorities for assisting the missionaries, it is necessary to point out that the Chinese authorities recognized their innocence and recognized the rights of Italian missionaries, mostly due to the informal talks between the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Italian Ambassador's representative in Chongqing on December 9 last year, and the talks between the Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Italy and the relevant departments of the Italian Foreign Ministry on January 5 this year."</p>
<h3>Japanese Wounded Soldiers Are Restless. Wujia Lane Hospital Is Threatened. Japanese Wounded Soldiers on Shangchuan Road Are Transported to Shanghai.</h3>
<p>On the western side of Shanghai, the Chinese guerrillas have been fiercely intercepting the Japanese troops stationed in Minhang North Bridge and other places recently. After the Japanese army headquarters of Shanghai High School near Hongqiao was attacked by guerrillas and set on fire, the Japanese army hospital set up in Wujia Lane (west of Hongqiao) is home to more than a hundred wounded soldiers, and is under great threat. Fearing danger, they are preparing to move elsewhere. It is now planned to send the seriously wounded Japanese soldiers from the hospital to Zhongshan Hospital by truck, and the lightly wounded Japanese soldiers to Shanghai Hospital in southern Shanghai, where they will be hospitalized for treatment separately. Also, on the Pudong side recently, the Chinese guerrillas are extremely active, and the Japanese troops stationed on the Shangchuan railway line are very fierce. There have been many deaths and injuries among the Japanese soldiers. Yesterday (the 8th) morning, two buses resembling those in Zhabei arrived at the South Wharf Ferry in Pudong, carrying five wounded Japanese soldiers and three puppet police officers, with white cloths tied on their heads and gauze wrapped around their arms and legs, all stained with blood. Two uninjured Japanese soldiers and two puppet police officers carried them onto the ferry one by one using canvas beds. When they landed at the Southwest Wharf, they were carried on canvas beds to a military truck waiting at the entrance of the wharf and transported to the Japanese Rear Hospital in the Santai Wharf in the South City for treatment. When the wounded soldiers arrived for the transition, the Japanese soldiers and puppet police stationed on the east and west wharves dispersed the passengers and were very vigilant. After the wounded soldiers' truck left, the original state was restored, and the ferry continued to carry passengers as usual.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Attempt to Sabotage Financial Secrets by Buying Public Bonds and Stocks. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs Investigate the Shops. Telegrams Order the Silver and Money Industries to Suppress It.</h3>
<p>The National Government's Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received a report stating that the Japanese are deliberately sabotaging our country's monetary credit and financial policies in the war zones. The methods are vicious and cannot be shaken. Seeing that the plan failed, the Japanese changed their strategy and instigated traitors to engage in the purchase of various bank bills, public bonds, and treasury bills, attempting to disrupt the financial system again. Some money changers who have not joined the money industry are adding fuel to the fire, helping the tyrants to abuse them, and openly absorbing buying and selling on their behalf. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that the matter was illegal and had a significant impact on the financial system. It is necessary to severely suppress it. Therefore, telegrams have been sent to the silver and money industries in this city to pay attention to it in order to suppress it.</p>
<h3>Remittances to Various Counties in Eastern Zhejiang Reduce the Supplementary Water Fee. The Previously Determined 2 Cents Per Yuan Is Reduced to 0.5 Cents Per Yuan.</h3>

<h3>Japan Protests Yongzhen Wheel Case, Customs is Consulting with the British. The Reason is "Violation of Customs Regulations."</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the Japanese side announced yesterday (the 7th) at a reception for reporters that the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao recently lodged a protest regarding the British Navy's actions in detaining the Yongzhen Wheel. The Jianghai Customs authorities and the British naval authorities are currently in intensive consultation regarding the protest. An embassy spokesman added that because Qingdao is under the occupation of the Japanese Navy, he did not know the content of the protest lodged by the Japanese Consul-General with the British authorities. According to the Japanese side, the British Navy used force to prevent the Qingdao Customs authorities from investigating the Yongzhen Wheel, so the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Qingdao, Kasatomo, sent a protest to the British Consul-General Martin on Tuesday. The Yongzhen Wheel was referred to as having violated customs regulations and was escorted to Qingdao under armed guard.</p>
<h3>Old Sassoon Tenants Plead for Deferred Rent Increase: No Peace Without Restored Police Authority - Request Postponement Until Opening</h3>
<p>The joint association of tenants from Renzhi Lane, East Wuchang Road, and Tongde Lane on North Sichuan Road sent a letter yesterday to the landlord, Old Sassoon, stating: To the Honorable Landlord: We, the members of this association, previously informed your esteemed firm that Renzhi and Tongde Lanes are both located within the area of Japanese military influence. We have been unable to return to reside there and humbly requested your firm to consider our years of friendship and temporarily waive the rent increase to demonstrate fairness. On the 11th of this month, we received your letter of the 10th, stating that the houses in the Renzhi Lane area, except for the shops opposite the old site of Wing On Bank, which are restricted from operating by the Japanese military headquarters, the residential houses in Renzhi Lane can be safely inhabited by citizens of any nationality. If your tenants can use the house but intentionally do not use it and refuse to pay rent, it will cause your firm's houses to be suspended for a long time, unable to collect rent, and suffer losses, etc. However, the area around Renzhi Lane is still within the Japanese military blockade line. It is well known that the Municipal Council has negotiated, but has not yet agreed to open it. Transportation is blocked, and movement is not free, let alone safe residence. Some people have obtained return permits from the Japanese military and moved back, but the vast majority cannot obtain such permits. In short, as long as the Municipal Council's police authority is not restored, the residents will have no security for even a day, and without security, they cannot live in peace. The letter states that the tenants can use the house but intentionally do not use it, which is simply unreasonable. As for the firm suffering losses due to unpaid rent, this is a common pain suffered by landlords in the unopened areas of Hongkou, not unique to your firm's houses in Renzhi and Tongde Lanes. Our tenants can only express their sympathy to your firm. Forcing rent payments for houses that cannot be inhabited is also not permitted by Chinese and foreign laws. Our tenants have always had a good relationship with your firm. We still ask for your understanding and to waive rent until the Japanese military opens the area and the Municipal Council's police authority is fully restored. The opening issue is still under negotiation by the Municipal Council. In the unlikely event that it remains unresolved after six months, then we can refer to how rent is paid for unopened houses in other areas and handle it accordingly, or negotiate other solutions with each other. However, those who have now returned to reside in the lanes are willing to make an effort to pay half rent monthly starting from December 1st until the area is truly open, at which point they will pay the full amount. This is limited by the circumstances and cannot be helped. Furthermore, for shops currently restricted from operating by the Japanese military, in addition to waiving rent entirely, the right to operate should still be reserved for the old tenants when they can operate as usual in the future to avoid disputes. The above measures have been discussed and agreed upon by our tenants in several meetings. They are reasonable and appropriate, so we are sending this letter specifically to request your firm to submit it to the board for consideration and implementation. We will be eternally grateful for your kindness.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Male and Female Pseudo-Police Organize Secret Party - Specialize in Kidnapping Puppets for Ransom - The Abduction of Pseudo "Municipal Secretary" Tang Wenyuan</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the abduction of pseudo "Municipal Secretary" Tang Wenyuan (formerly mistranscribed as Yuan) at the northern end of the Waibaidu Bridge at approximately 7:00 AM on the 6th, it has now been further learned that Tang has indeed paid the ransom and been released. The people who abducted Tang are all dismissed pseudo-"police" from the pseudo-"government," both male and female. The details have been obtained as follows:</p>
<p>Pseudo-Police Become Bandits Who Specialize in Abducting Pseudo-Officials: Since the shocking assassination of pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiaoan in Jiangwan, it was discovered that the suicide bomber was pseudo-"Secretary-General" Su Xiwang's hand-picked pseudo-"Guard Team" pseudo-"police" Zhou Wenshan. When the guarantor of the assassin, Jiang Tongyi, also escaped three days before the incident, the matter was reported to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. The pseudo-"Municipal Government's Second Section Chief," Zhang Guangzhao, who recommended Jiang Tongyi, and the pseudo-"Police Bureau's Second Section Chief," Zhang Boliang, were both detained for thirty-seven days. Due to lack of leads, they were released. Extremely angered by the failure to find the mastermind, a large number of pseudo-"Guard Team" officers were dismissed. These pseudo-"police" were mostly bandits by origin. After losing their jobs, they united with some pseudo-"female police" dismissed from the pseudo-"Police Bureau" to organize a secret party specializing in kidnapping pseudo-"government" puppets for ransom to make a living.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Finance Bureau Employees Were Kidnapped First: Several days before Tang was kidnapped, this bandit gang had twice operated near the Waibaidu Bridge northern end, near the pseudo-bus stop, kidnapping two people one after another. One was Yan Daming, a pseudo-"Finance Bureau staff member," and the other was unidentified. Both were blindfolded and taken to a secret organization at an unknown address for negotiations. The bandits demanded one month's pseudo-salary per person, no discounts. If the amount they carried was less than one month's pseudo-salary, their pseudo-"employee ID" and pseudo-"permit" would be retained and they would be released to collect the full amount to redeem the items. They threatened those kidnapped that if they reported to the Japanese military or pseudo-authorities to pursue them, they would use the ultimate means to deal with them. Therefore, the two pseudo-employees endured the pain of paying the ransom, and afterwards were crestfallen and dared not speak out.</p>
<p>The Inside Story is Revealed After Tang Pays the Ransom: After Tang Wenyuan was kidnapped, he was also taken to a secret organization at an unknown location. Several ringleaders, both male and female, were there. Tang immediately recognized many of them. They claimed to be former pseudo-"police" who, due to being dismissed and unemployed, were forced to live this inhuman life. However, they were determined to only kidnap traitors, not others, to show that they were not lagging behind in patriotism. They ordered Tang to be sensible and immediately pay one month's pseudo-salary to redeem himself. Tang, a Fujianese in his fifties with graying hair, was one of the first small puppets to appear on stage at Su Xiwang's pseudo-"Great Way Municipal Government" in Pudong. He lived on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession and currently earned a monthly pseudo-salary of one hundred and eighty yuan. At that time, Tang burst into tears, begging for a reduced price. The bandits first searched him and found more than ten yuan, then took off his coat and sent a bandit into the concession to pawn it, obtaining only thirty yuan. Far from the amount of one hundred and eighty yuan, they retained Tang's pseudo-employee ID and pseudo-"permit." After releasing Tang, Tang gathered seventy yuan over three hours to redeem them, begging bitterly and expressing that he could not gather one month's pseudo-salary. The bandits agreed and returned the pseudo-documents. Tang left in a disheveled state.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Officials Fearfully Disguise Themselves When Going Out: After the kidnapping cases of the two pseudo-officials from the pseudo-government, large and small puppets from Fu Xiaoan downwards, including pseudo-"bureau chiefs," pseudo-"secretaries," pseudo-"section chiefs," pseudo-"staff members," and pseudo-"clerks," were deeply afraid of encountering the same fate in the future and were all naturally uneasy. On their way to and from the pseudo-"government," they were all sneaky and dared not show their faces as they used to. Some pseudo-officials even had whimsical ideas and disguised themselves to avoid becoming targets of the bandits. Those who originally wore suits switched to Chinese clothing, and those who originally wore Chinese clothing switched to suits. Those who did not wear glasses added glasses, while those who were nearsighted removed their glasses. Those with beards shaved them off, while young people grew short beards. There were many jokes and they were extremely disheveled.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Develops Evil Intent During Escape, Stealing Owner's Belongings - Huge Sum of Cash and Jewelry Hidden in the Countryside and at Home - Couple Flees to Shanghai, Owner Encounters Them and Arrests Them</h3>
<p>Tang Shaoyu, an 80-year-old renowned female doctor of gynecology from Songjiang outside the East Gate, practiced medicine in the countryside and had considerable assets. When the war broke out two years ago and the National Army moved west, Tang packed all the valuables and trunks at home. He and his family hired a Xiang Sheng car to escape to Shanghai and resided at No. 11 Wufeng Lane, intersection of Xiafei Road and Lvban Bamboo Road in the French Concession. When they were about to leave Songjiang, because the Xiang Sheng car</p>
<p>had a narrow compartment, not all the trunks could fit in. A leather suitcase and a handbag were left behind, and Zhu Jinfu (26 years old this year), a rickshaw puller from Fengjing hired by the family, was asked to temporarily watch and guard them, instructing him to return to Songjiang after the car arrived in Shanghai to pick them up and bring the suitcases to Shanghai. The leather suitcase contained gold jewelry worth 4,000 gold pieces, and the handbag contained 6,000 yuan in cash. After the Tang family</p>
<p>left Songjiang, Zhu secretly opened the leather suitcase and handbag to inspect them. Seeing that the suitcases were full of cash and valuables, he was overjoyed and immediately developed an evil intention. He took the two suitcases and fled, and when the owner sent a car to Songjiang again to pick up Zhu and the suitcases, the house was empty and he could not be found, so he had to return to Shanghai empty-handed. Zhu took the two suitcases directly to his home in Fengjing, where he buried most of the jewelry and cash</p>
<p>underground at his home. He and his wife brought a small amount of jewelry and cash to Shanghai and rented a small room at No. 64 Qianjiatang in the French Concession, where the couple lived a comfortable life. The day before yesterday, Zhu Jinfu was passing by the entrance of Wufeng Lane at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Lvban Road when, unexpectedly, he was spotted by a relative of the owner, Tang Shaoyu, who ran to inform the Tang family. They sent people to chase him out, and the police were notified.</p>
<p>The Stolen Goods Were Recovered: He was taken to the police station, where the victim, Tang Shaoyu, reported that Zhu Jinfu had embezzled and possessed the property of others, requesting an investigation. Zhu confessed without hesitation that there were still stolen goods buried underground at his home in the countryside. The police detained him and yesterday sent him to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting a rescheduled hearing and further interrogation. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned the defendant, he ordered a rescheduled hearing in fifteen days. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Fabricated Stories to Deceive - Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaohu from Wuxi had previously committed theft in the French Concession and was sent to the Second Special District Local Court by the police, sentenced to imprisonment. After serving his term, he disappeared without a trace. On the 6th of this month, he suddenly reappeared in this isolated island. That morning, he suddenly went to the Wang Huiji Machine Factory at No. 271 Weihaiwei Road and told the factory owner, Wang Huifang, that after graduating from the Mine School, he served at the Jiangyin Fort and then went to Gan with the army. Now, because</p>
<p>the cannon parts were damaged, they were transported from Gan to Shanghai for repair and loaded onto a German merchant ship at Hupu, which would arrive in Shanghai today. He specially came to Wang's factory for repairs. Wang, hearing this, immediately sent the accountant, Wang Yinting, to the Bund pier to inspect the extent of the damage in order to determine the repair cost. Because Wang Xiaohu said that he still owed the shipping company seventy yuan for freight and needed a temporary advance, Wang Huifang gave the money to Yinting</p>
<p>to go with him. They waited at the pier until evening, but when the ship arrived, Xiaohu asked Yinting for the money and went straight onto the ship. Yinting followed him into the ship and wandered around for a long time, but there were no damaged cannon parts and none of the ship's officers knew him. As a result, Yinting still followed him ashore and, feeling that Xiaohu's actions were suspicious, immediately called the police and had him arrested. All the original funds were confiscated. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Meng Tingke interrogated him. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the defendant's</p>
<p>false accusations and deception, requesting punishment. When questioned, the defendant Wang Xiaohu still claimed that he was ordered to escort the damaged parts to Shanghai for repair, saying that he came in disguise as an ordinary person, so he had no identification documents. When asked why he did not see any of the ship's machinery, he evaded the question. Judge Meng, after verifying the confession, ruled that the defendant was clearly fabricating stories and deceiving, and sentenced him to three months in prison. The original stolen 70 yuan in legal currency was returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Pickpocket Leader Dong Qigao Assassinated by Rival - Hit in a Vital Spot, Died on the Spot - Resentment with Accomplices Resulted in Assassination</h3>
<p>On Bailinan Road near Caojiadu in western Shanghai, another shooting occurred at approximately 9:45 AM yesterday. The victim was Dong Qigao from Yancheng, a pseudo-famous pickpocket leader, head of the Huayiezi gang, nicknamed "Little Bad Knife." Dong has been specializing in the above activities in this city. Because of his great connections, both gangs regarded him as their pseudo-leader, and Dong used this momentum to reside in the Caojiadu area.</p>
<p>Arrogant and Despotic, Acting Recklessly, he also sided with Geng Shoubao, the pseudo-"Detective Squad Leader" who was killed the other day, and recognized Geng as his adoptive father. As a result, it was like adding wings to a tiger, and Dong's reputation grew. Recently, gambling has been rampant in western Shanghai, and Dong, relying on the strength of his henchmen, served as a</p>
<p>protector for gambling dens. On the one hand, he learned that Bao Ziying had succeeded Geng Shoubao's pseudo-position, so he repeatedly flattered Bao, and Bao also had the intention of winning Dong over, so they hit it off. Dong Qigao actually joined the pseudo-"Detective Team" as a pseudo-member. At approximately 9:00 AM yesterday, Dong was</p>
<p>Having Tea at the Siyang Teahouse near Robert Road. Soon after, feeling that the fur robe he was wearing was unsuitable for the weather, he returned to his home at No. 7 Xieyu Lane on Bailinan Road to change. Unexpectedly, three men secretly followed him. Seeing Dong enter the lane, they immediately pulled out their guns and shot him. A total of three shots were fired, one of which hit Dong in the head. He fell to the ground, but the perpetrators did not leave immediately. They stepped forward and fired two more shots at Dong's head and chest. Seeing that he</p>
<p>was definitely dead, they fled. When Dong's mother and wife heard the alarm and came out to look, he was already dead. At that time, the Japanese and puppet authorities sent many pseudo-police to search, but nothing was found. As for the reason for the killing, there are different theories. However, it is generally speculated that after Dong took the pseudo-position, he arrested many Huayiezi and pickpocket gang members in the hope of currying favor with the pseudo-officials, or that he had incurred the resentment of his accomplices and was assassinated.</p>
<h3>Murderer Disagrees with Verdict, Appeals, and Case Concludes</h3>
<p>Cao Akun, a Jiangyin gangster from the wharf, previously protected the transportation of opium at the wharves in Pudong West. At 5:00 AM on June 28, 1932, due to resentment with accomplices, he was shot and killed on the third floor of the Fuli Public House at No. 75 Minguo Road. The French police successively arrested the murderers, Xu Changyu from Ningbo and Tao Yongchang (also known as Xiaoxizi) from Nanjing, and sent them to court for prosecution. They were sentenced to heavy sentences. Another murderer, Tang Yunqing (37 years old this year, from Taizhou, also known as Xiaotaizhou), escaped at the time and was ordered to be arrested, but he was not caught. Until noon on October 25 of last year, Tang was ferried to Shanghai from Pudong by a sampan rocked by Tao Guyi, the wife of accomplice Tao Yongchang. Guyi reported to the police and Tang was arrested and sent to the Second Court for legal prosecution. As a result, he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Tang disagreed and hired lawyer Pipa Shizong to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Wu Tingqi, together with judges Chen and Wang, held a joint court session with the prosecutor for interrogation. Tang firmly denied participating in the murder, claiming that he only knew about it afterwards and was falsely accused by Xu and Tao. The court also summoned the investigating detectives, the already convicted accomplice Tao Yongchang, and the deceased's wife, Cao Dai, for questioning. After the questioning, they were ordered to make arguments, which were immediately declared closed, and the sentence was scheduled for the 13th. Tang was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Seize Large Numbers of Gangs - Also Seize Weapons</h3>
<p>Liu Shaokui, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police General Inspectorate, detectives Zhu Shuling and Zhou Honglin, etc., previously arrested four members of the gang, including Lu Yuanyu, and seized a pistol and three bullets. The day before yesterday, based on the confession of the arrested, they arrested ten other accomplices at No. 116 Shunde Road, No. 12 East Zilaihuo Street, and No. 434 Elgin Road, including Tu Desheng, Xue Litang, Liu Peitang, Dong Lieshan, Zhou Guoyuan, Ding Amao, Ding Mao, Ji Shanyuan, Dong Hua, Wang Wang, etc., and seized two pistols and nine bullets. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that there were many arrestees in this case and the investigation would take time, so he requested permission to temporarily detain them and investigate them together with Lu Yuanyu, etc. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he ordered them to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Farmers Win Case Against Bank - Yuan Xingde's Request is Rejected</h3>
<p>In the case of Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank Shanghai Branch being sued by Yuan Xingde Flower Company for compensation for damages, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court ordered the Farmers Bank to compensate Yuan Xingde for losses of 60,000 yuan in June of last year. Afterwards, the Farmers Bank disagreed and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After several court sessions lasting eight months, the verdict was announced yesterday: "The original judgment is changed, and the appellant's request is rejected. The costs of the first and second trials shall be borne by the appellant." The Farmers Bank has reversed its defeat.</p>
<h3>Drug Trafficking Organization Uncovered in Zhongnan Hotel - Six Arrested, Including the Principal Offender</h3>
<p>Ye Yusi, chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession Police Narcotics Department, detectives Li Shugui, Liu Zhaonian, etc., learned that someone was organizing a drug trafficking opium den in Room 501 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Doumer. They went to investigate and seized five people, including Bi Wei from Ningbo, Song Baozhen from Tianjin, Liu Zhenying, Liu Hanqing, and Bi Wenlong from Hangzhou, and seized 188 taels of opium. According to their confession, the owner of this opium was Zheng Rongshun from Tianjin, who lived in Room 34 of the Hexing Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. They went to arrest Zheng and seized another 24 taels of opium. Zheng confessed that the opium was brought from Qinhuangdao. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them according to Article 5 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The defendants hired lawyers Chen Tingrui, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. After interrogation by Qian Hongye, the criminal court, ordered the defendants to be returned to custody, as the case still needed investigation, and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Assassins in Yu Yaozhang Case Confess Frankly - Say Anyone Who Recognizes the Enemy as Father Deserves to Die - Must Still Review Files, Reschedule Hearing</h3>
<p>Yu Yaozhang, the pseudo-"Jiangsu Provincial Government," "Jiading County Police Bureau," "Chief," was originally a local bully in the county before the National Army withdrew. He had previously served in the county Public Security Bureau. After the National Army moved west, Yu immediately curried favor with the traitors and was thus appointed to this pseudo-position. On November 12 of last year, Yu came to Shanghai on business. Your concubine hired a rickshaw and, passing through the intersection of Zhejiang Road near Fuzhou Road, several strong men suddenly jumped out from the roadside and fired at Yu with pistols. Yu dodged but was hit in the back by a bullet and fell onto the rickshaw. The nearby guards and patrol officers No. 1087, 388, 2291, 2735, 455, etc., rushed to the scene and surrounded the area. At that time, Li Gaowen (25 years old, from Hebei), one of the assassins, opened fire to resist arrest, and the officers returned fire. Bullets flew everywhere. Li was shot in the leg and had run out of bullets, so he was arrested. A large-caliber six-round pistol was seized, and six bullets were found in his pocket. Li and Yu were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. By the 14th, Yu's injuries were fatal, so there was no way to save him. Li Gaowen's injuries have now healed, so the police sent Li to the First Court yesterday morning, charged with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. It was confirmed that Yu Yaozhang had been shot by Li's gun, so Li should be held responsible. Li did not deny shooting Yu Yaozhang, saying that Yu had recognized the enemy as his father and that anyone who was a national deserved to die, and that he himself was acting under orders. After verifying the confession in court, it was ordered that the autopsy files be reviewed and defense lawyers be appointed, and the hearing was rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Radio Station Manager Impersonates Government Official to Defraud - Factory Owner Cheated Out of 700 Yuan - Reported to Police After Discovering Fraud</h3>
<p>Jin Binggen, 27 years old, a native of Nanhui and owner of the Xintai Construction Factory at No. 66, Rue Amiral Villar, was recently building a house on vacant land at Lane 1320, intersection of Route Frelupt and Route Lafayette. Because the house plans and construction license had not been approved and issued by the Engineering Department of the French Municipal Council, work could not begin. On January 8, Gu Yihua (25 years old, son of Gu Leiyin, who currently broadcasts plays on the Liangyou Huadong Radio Station) from Suzhou, manager of the Liangyou Radio Station at No. 454 Nanjing Road, impersonating an employee of the French Municipal Council's Construction License Office, colluded with Zhang Jinlu (currently at large) to act as an introducer. They went to the Xintai Construction Factory to solicit Jin Binggen, claiming that they had the power to obtain the license for a fee of 1,400 yuan, and promised to issue the license within two weeks. Jin believed them and paid 700 yuan, with the remaining amount to be paid after the license was obtained. Gu and Zhang happily left with the money. After two weeks, Jin found that there was no news and investigated with the French Municipal Council, but there was no such thing. He then found out that he had been fooled. He went to Gu to reason with him, but Gu evaded the question. Jin then hired lawyer Huang Jiyuan to report to the French Police Station, and they sent a detective to arrest Gu Yihua. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Court. Gu Shouxi, lawyer of the French Concession Administration, stated that the defendant had impersonated a government official to defraud and requested a rescheduled investigation and further interrogation. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Huang Jiyuan, who filed an incidental civil suit seeking to recover the 700 yuan that had been defrauded. The plaintiff then stated the circumstances of the fraud. When Gu Yihua was questioned, he confessed that he had graduated from the Aurora University preparatory course and was the manager of the Liangyou Radio Station. He only admitted to receiving 200 yuan for the fraud. The court ordered a rescheduled hearing on the 15th.</p>
<h3>French Authorities Commend Father Scheidt of the Observatory - Awarded Gold Medal</h3>
<p>Father Zi Shi, who has served at the local observatory for many years, has never slackened in his duties and has worked diligently for years. His specific duty is to report the changes in weather observed to local and foreign cities and ships at sea, so that the disasters suffered by various places can be prevented in time and avoid losses.

<h3>A Terrifying Scene on Anhhe Temple Road: Dozens Gather and Open Fire - Damaged the Gate of the Leather Factory and the Glass Windows of a Car</h3>
<p>Anhhe Temple Road in western Shanghai is an extra-jurisdictional road section, facing north towards Columbia Road. The location is desolate. More than forty people gathered on the road and fired indiscriminately. The gate of the Zhongnan Leather Factory at No. 4 on the road was also hit by several bullets. Approximately thirty shots were fired in total, and they left in a group. Their intentions were unclear. They neither injured anyone nor robbed anyone, so it was probably just to create terror. Afterwards, the concession police searched the Kunlian district for prevention, but no findings were made. It was heard that the glass windows of a No. 2 bus passing through Columbia Road were damaged by two stray bullets, but there were no injuries.</p>
<h3>Increased Police Presence During Business Closing Period to Prevent Theft and Robbery; Vegetable Market Extends Business Hours</h3>
<p>The French Concession's Public Works Bureau originally stipulated that all roadside vegetable markets' business hours end at 10:00 AM, with penalties for those who fail to comply. Now, with the Lunar New Year approaching, the Public Works Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that, for the sake of informing the public, the public vegetable markets will be permitted to operate until 4:00 PM daily during the Spring Festival period of February 14th (Tuesday), 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th, 1939. At the same time, as businesses are closing their books for the year, and in order to prevent theft and robbery, all police stations have been ordered to increase vigilance during this period and to search suspicious pedestrians along the way. The Public Concession Police Department is also taking similar precautions.</p>
<h3>Four Banks to Redeem Damaged Currency Notes to the Greatest Extent Possible</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Association previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it instruct all issuing banks to redeem damaged currency notes as much as possible. After the Association submitted a request to the Ministry, it was telegraphed separately to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to earnestly improve the situation and redeem as much as possible. Now, the Ministry of Finance has replied, based on telegrams from the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Farmers Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank, stating that all banks are redeeming damaged banknotes to the greatest extent possible. The Jiangsu Farmers Bank and China Farmers Bank are also complying with the method of redeeming damaged banknotes and exchanging them as much as possible, and there is absolutely no obstruction. If there are times when exchange customers are crowded or there is a lack of deep understanding of the exchange methods, misunderstandings are unavoidable. Having received your telegram, in addition to complying and earnestly improving and redeeming as much as possible, we hereby telegraph a reply, etc. The Ministry will then inform the Money Exchange Association for their information.</p>
<h3>After Failure to Establish a Securities Exchange, Plans to Establish a Trust Company</h3>
<p>For the past few months, there has been long brewing activity to establish an illegal securities exchange in Shanghai, but it was abandoned due to opposition from all sides. Now, it is heard that a certain Mr. Wang and others, seeing that their plan was not successful, have changed their plan and are plotting to establish a trust company, ostensibly to buy and sell British and American gold certificates, but in reality, to engage in margin trading of securities and operate a disguised securities exchange. It is heard that they are currently looking for premises, preparing to open for business next spring. Speculators are eagerly trying to participate. Formal major merchants in Shanghai believe that since the company is neither registered nor operating legally, they have telegraphed the ministry to order a prohibition.</p>
<h3>Car Crashes into Pedestrian Opposite the Great World</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 8th) at around 11:00 AM, in front of the Sanhe Lou restaurant on Avenue Albert, south of the Great World in the French Concession, a private car with license plate number 1685, driven by a young driver in Western clothing, failed to brake in time and violently struck a Mr. Shi from Pinghu, aged around forty. He was thrown over ten feet, suffering severe injuries to his waist and chest. He lay on the ground, unconscious. The police arrived and lifted the injured man into the car, sending him to the hospital for treatment. Then the car was taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire at Ink Factory Causes Losses of 20,000 to 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Hengcheng Ink Factory at No. 120, Lane 117, Chengdu Road, in the Public Concession, caught fire carelessly yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM. In an instant, flames roared and rose high. The factory's machinery, goods, and thirteen or fourteen storage sheds were completely destroyed. The fire was extinguished after the Fire Brigade arrived and used belt-driven pumps to put it out for an hour. It is heard that the loss was estimated to be about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The cause of the fire was due to oil leaking from a machine.</p>

<h3>Securities; British and German Continued Debts Jump One and a Half Pounds; Domestic Debt Market's End is Near</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market yesterday was fluctuating and unstable. Both buyers and sellers were not enthusiastic, and the market price was still showing signs of weakness in the volatility. The idleness of people's hearts and the ups and downs of the market atmosphere are due to the fact that the lunar new year has arrived, and most industries have closed. There is no intention to operate. Due to the dull environment, there is no stimulating new information (it is heard that there are regulations for off-exchange trading, which will be done until next Tuesday within the year, that is, December 26th of the lunar calendar). It will not open until the fifth day of the lunar New Year. Therefore, major players have shrunk back, and only sporadic retail investors are embellishing the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday's process, whether buying or selling, was not of great significance. When there were more buyers, the price rose slightly, and when there were more sellers, the price fell slightly. The ups and downs were unpredictable. No. 35, Runli, and No. 22 successively sold or came out at the opening, and the market price fell by five or six cents. Lemao and No. 11 suddenly bought in at the low price, and Xinfeng Yong took the opportunity to cover the short position, so it returned two or three cents. The market was relatively stable in the afternoon at the close, but the transaction was even more reduced. Initially, the price was firm because Tiansheng and No. 11 continued to buy, and then the price was weak because Hengde and Dafeng slightly supplied. As a result of the full-day swing, the price was slightly down by one-fifth of a dime to three and a half cents. The total turnover was about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified A | 55.70 | 55.05 | 55.45 | Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified B | 47.60 | 46.90 | 47.20 | Up 0.35</p>
<p>Unified C | 45.70 | 45.10 | 45.60 | Up 0.15</p>
<p>Unified E | 44.85 | 44.20 | 44.30 | Down 0.10</p>
<p>96 | 6.75 | 6.75 | Up 0.05</p>
<p>Stock trading was also very light due to the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, only 50 shares of Nanshi Huashang Gas stocks were traded at a price of 5 yuan, which was slightly smaller than before by 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>London's Chinese foreign debt market prices on the 7th of this month (Tuesday): British and German continued loans.

<h3>Finance; Foreign Exchange Loosens; Cash Price Suddenly Turns Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash market situation suddenly turned weak again. Because foreign exchange was gradually softening due to the dumping by Hong Kong Power and Western merchants, and British pure gold has also fallen for three consecutive days, people's hearts have suddenly become exhausted. Although gold shops and the Northern gang bought, the number was limited, so the price gradually decreased from high and has approached the 2,040 yuan mark. Transactions were also relatively light because major players waited and watched. Jewelry gold fell by two yuan, customs gold did not change, and Sino-British pure gold and other prices fell again.</p>
<p>Cash fell eleven yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, because it was heard that foreign exchange was weakening due to the dumping by Hong Kong Power, most buyers waited and watched. The two sides held on to each other until about 10 o'clock, when the jewelry gang sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry at an opening price of 2,051 yuan, which was 6 yuan lower than the previous day. After opening, the cash shop sold 40 taels to the money exchange industry at the same price. Then the Northern gang suddenly came to absorb and buy 50 taels from the jewelry gang at a price of 52 yuan. Later, gold shops mutually made 50 taels at the same price. After that, there were fewer buyers, and the price fell. The jewelry gang sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry and 50 taels to the gold shops, both at a price of 50 yuan. Later, the gold shops absorbed 100 taels from the money exchange industry at a price of 49 yuan. It was already 10:45. After that, the supply and demand became scarce, and no transactions were seen until noon, so the closing price was 49 yuan. In the afternoon, because there was no market for foreign exchange, it was quite calm at the beginning. After 2:15, a money exchange industry suddenly came out on behalf of the multi-party, and the price was lowered from 48 or 9 yuan to 46 yuan, before the transaction was seen, selling 50 taels to the same industry at a price of 46 yuan. It was already 2:30. After that, buyers were even more lacking, and there were more sellers at that time, so the price gradually fell to 40 yuan, but still did not get an opponent. After a moment, someone suddenly came to absorb and buy, but the sellers at that time were unwilling to sell cheaply, so they did not make a transaction, so the closing price was still 2,046 yuan, which was 11 yuan lower than the previous day. The cash shops' selling price of standard gold was 2,055 yuan, and the buying price was 2,040 yuan. The current spot gold price is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no transactions have been made.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold twice quoted small</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael did not change at the beginning. At about 10:30, because the trend of spot gold was very weak, the price was reduced by one yuan. Then, at 4:30 in the afternoon, because spot gold was even weaker, the price was reduced by another yuan. Da Tonghang Lao Qingyun and others changed the price to 207 yuan, and Xin Tonghang also changed the price to 205 yuan, buying at 199 yuan.</p>
<p>Pound Sterling High, Pure Gold Continues to Fall</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 7th, because the pound sterling is becoming increasingly high, more sellers have been triggered, so the price per ounce has fallen by another one and a half pence, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 4 pence. The Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price has also fallen to 1,210 yuan, 0.9 jiao. The listed customs gold price has not changed, still at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard spot gold price has also fallen by one yuan, calculated at 1,206 yuan, 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Still Maintains the Exchange Rate, and People's Hearts See Stability Again; Western Merchant Sassoon's Selling Intention Is Also Strong; The US Dollar Reaches the 16 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>After the exchange rate turned to a swinging situation the day before yesterday, and it was heard that HSBC was willing to sell as much as possible at a maintaining price of 8 pence and 125, people's hearts suddenly saw stability. Yesterday, Hong Kong Power and Western merchant Sassoon in this city competed to dump, causing the trend to loosen. Although foreign firms and foreign banks came to buy and close their positions, because the positions were still disparate, the potential trend was still hard. The transaction volume was still strong on the day. Because money exchange industries were selling a lot of Hong Kong exchange, and the stomachs of various foreign banks were unhealthy, the market situation also slightly returned to looseness.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bars were long in both the near and far terms, the New York spot goods remained unchanged, the London raw gold shrank by another one and a half pence, the exchange rate of British to US was large four and a half cents, British to French was small three centimes, and to Shanghai it fell by 0.0625. The US to British and to French both rose by 0.0625, and to Shanghai it rose by four cents. The central listed price was fixed as before. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, British exchange rate 8 pence 140625, US exchange rate 15 yuan 90625, both flat compared to the previous close. After opening, Hong Kong Power suddenly came to dump, first selling to foreign banks British gold 8 pence 171875 and 1875, then selling to HSBC British gold 8 pence 203125, so the status was hard. HSBC's listed price was revealed not to move, and the silver balance tax was revealed to rise by 25, calculated at 5.5%. After that, although foreign banks and foreign firms picked up, the southwest Sassoon's selling intention was steeply strong, and Hong Kong Power continued to sell, so the status finally became hard. Hong Kong Power and Western merchant Sassoon successively sold US exchange to US Bank, Huabi Foreign Bank, etc. at 15 yuan 9375 to 16 yuan. Then the foreign banks also came to repeat, Mecca Lee Holland US Bank and Yihua Lian sold British gold to foreign firms at 8 pence 203125, and US exchange at 16 yuan. In addition, money exchange industries also sold to Anda Holland Hong Kong exchange at 54 yuan and a half and 75, so the trend was still loose. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's selling price was British exchange rate 8 pence 203125, US exchange rate 16 yuan 03125. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British was long by 0625, the US was hard by 125, and the Hong Kong exchange was also cheap by 375. There was no market in the afternoon of Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Retreats Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold continued to fall by one and a half points, British-American exchange rates continued to rise by 0.0625, and foreign exchange settlements were not strong. The supply from Hong Kong electric, Jewish gangs, etc. was very smooth, and the market price gradually became loose, trending firmly. Subsequently, as foreign exchange loosened, many parties began to release, and the supply suddenly became strong. Although the Tianjin gang's absorption did not slacken, ultimately, the number of those releasing was large, resulting in ample funds. The market price gradually declined, showing a very weak trend. This is a reaction to the consecutive days of high prices. As the exchange market eased, foreign currencies weakened in cash, and collectors eagerly released their holdings. The market price rapidly declined, and transactions were brisk. The guild exchange had not yet opened. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds decreased by 3 jiao, British gold notes decreased by 3 jiao and 1 fen, American gold pounds decreased by 3 jiao, American gold notes decreased by 6 fen and 8 li, Hong Kong notes decreased by 1 fen and 2 li, French franc notes decreased by 1 li, Singapore notes decreased by 2 fen, Dutch notes decreased by 3 fen, Rupee notes decreased by 2 fen, Canadian notes decreased by 5 fen, Philippine notes decreased by 4 fen and a half, Australian gold notes decreased by 4 jiao. Only Annam notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Rise for Both Near and Distant Terms</h3>
<p>Seventh, London telegram: Silver market speculators bought a small amount, and some came to cover short positions, lacking supply. The market was relatively flat, and continued to be stable after closing. Silver prices for both near and distant terms increased by 0.0625. Also, New York telegram: American silver prices remained stable as before. Bombay had no telegram due to holiday.</p>
<h3>Clearing House Public Bill Exchange Amount - Unit: Yuan</h3>
<p>January 30 1,170,999</p>
<p>January 31 1,167,878</p>
<p>February 1 767,507</p>
<p>February 2 790,279</p>
<p>February 3 1,057,529</p>
<p>February 4 922,610</p>
<p>Total 5,876,802</p>
<p>Discount Rate Recovers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills saw a slight rebound, but the difference was still minimal. The price per thousand yuan remained around 35 yuan, with the final price being 35 yuan, an increase of 2 jiao and a half compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Grains Large Quantities of Flour Shipped North and South Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market trend was relatively balanced. Retail sales had been sporadic for consecutive days, with daily transactions only reaching twenty to thirty thousand bags. Amidst rumors of a surge of imported wheat, people inevitably felt fatigued. However, the factories still adhered to their original quotations and were not affected by it. This was because the factories' inventory of raw materials was scarce. It is said that the Tianjin gang's formal transactions, although not smooth, had already seen a considerable amount of flour shipped out, purchased by a major customer from North China previously. Moreover, with the Lunar New Year approaching, even if imported wheat arrived, it would be impossible to produce flour from it immediately. Therefore, the market could still be supported. The Nanyang gang and the local street each transacted over eight thousand bags. The Beiyang gang also cleared less than ten thousand bags. Number two flour still required 4 yuan and 8 jiao. The asking price for Number four flour "Red God of Wealth" actually increased, reportedly requiring 4 yuan and 3 jiao, but no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 300 bags of flour were shipped to Ningbo. Today's exports include 27,800 bags to Fuzhou, 26,800 bags to Xiamen, 7,800 bags to Tianjin, and 2,500 bags to Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>Additionally, today another 700 bags of bran were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market as Depressed as Before 1,700 Bags Shipped to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of wheat continued to be sparse. As the Lunar New Year approached, merchants mostly ceased transport operations. Moreover, production prices were high, and sellers insisted on their prices. Factories, however, citing the arrival of imported wheat, poor appetite, and even with price concessions, could not handle large quantities. Therefore, the market remained as depressed as before. Fufeng Factory continued to suspend operations. Fuxin Factory only opened for Jiangbei wheat, in a limited quantity of only 300 bags, with the price still at 6 yuan and 6 jiao. The market was quiet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,780 bags of wheat were shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Year-End Closing Approaches Rice Prices Rise Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's supply of domestic rice included over two thousand bags of the second grade, wheel-transported "baozi" rice arriving from Hexia, and two thousand bags arriving from Hupu, and eight hundred bags arriving from Qiya. As the year-end closing date approached, the supply from all sources was scarce. Those holding Shanghai warehouse goods had no intention of holding over the New Year, while local street sellers and hoarders became particularly eager. This caused the intentions of buyers and sellers to diverge, resulting in a situation where supply could not meet demand. The market was chaotic, shouts rose in confusion, and prices rose all the way up. At the end of the market, thick japonica rice prices soared by 2-3 jiao. Thin indica rice, due to hoarders observing, only had sporadic retail activity, and the price increase was relatively small, only increasing by 1 jiao. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice also increased by 1-2 jiao. Yuan, as a seasonal product, was even more popular, with high-quality goods opening at 15 yuan. It is said that one thousand three hundred bags were exported to Xiamen today.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Transactions Exceed 3,000 Bags Market Prices Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer xian rice was absorbed by hoarders, and local street sellers' demand was particularly strong. The number of transactions increased to over three thousand bags throughout the day. The arrival and inventory of high-quality goods were both low, and market prices became even more bullish, rising by an additional jiao or two compared to the previous market. Nanjing's Dashi high-quality xian rice opened at 11 yuan 1-2 jiao, while the highest quality goods had already risen to 11 yuan 4 jiao. The ordinary high-quality Wuxian rice purchased by hoarders had largely reached beyond 11 yuan. Recent activity from both hoarders and shops, with not much arriving, suggests the market may continue to rise with people's expectations.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Stagnate Market Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>The yarn market began to advance and then retreated, with the trend showing a slightly chaotic and inconsistent state. It is believed that the market sentiment and general opinion are that there will definitely be a prosperous and flourishing trend in the coming spring. Therefore, even though factories have opened up a large amount of futures contracts for March and April deliveries, general merchants are still very welcoming. At the same time, those with ample finances are constantly mixing in foreign warehouse goods to avoid the trouble of transferring warehouses, as the procedures are cumbersome and finding a suitable warehouse space for damage is quite difficult. This shows the firmness of the hoarders' intentions, who have long prepared for a long-term holding plan. Although the current demand for yarn is clear, the market price remains as stable as a rock. Yesterday, the actual customer transactions were only 172 bales. However, due to the year-end approaching, most people were dealing with settling accounts and business matters, and thus the market stagnated. Awaiting a decision on direction in the coming New Year.</p>
<p>Actual Sales Less Than 200 Bales</p>
<p>The current situation of the yarn market is as follows: the morning opening was sluggish due to inactive customer business, and the situation remained deadlocked for a long time. However, the opening prices continued the momentum of the previous day, adding an additional 5 jiao, with the double strand price of 20-count yarn being 404 yuan, and the Lao Jincheng being 395 yuan. After that, it was heard that current sales were not coming, and everyone said there was no ability to handle it. The market gradually declined, with the final price of Double Horse being 401.5 yuan, and the Tiannv warehouse single transaction reaching 397 yuan. As a result, after checking the morning transaction statistics, 932 bales were transacted. The market prices for 20-count Double Horse fell by 2 yuan, Tiannv fell by 5 jiao, Double Globe was flat, Shepherd was flat, Haozuo rose by 5 yuan, and Special Jincheng was flat. The customer volume purchased by each gang is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 80, Co-worker 760, Ningbo 7, Shantou 60, Yunnan 20, Fujian 5, Total 93</p>
<p>Yarn Factories Continue to Open Yarn Contracts Unabated</p>
<p>Xin Yu Yarn Factory opened 1,300 bales of 20-count Double Globe, priced at 400 to 401 yuan, for March and April deliveries. The recipient must pay three-quarters of the fixed deposit per bale. Such a large deposit is unprecedented in the history of the yarn industry. Xin Sheng Factory reopened 600 bales of 20-count Golden Tiger, with the price still at 390 yuan, collecting a fixed deposit of 30 yuan per bale. Chongxin Yarn Factory opened 200 bales of 10-count Dafa, priced at 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Transactions Remain as Quiet as Before</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market situation remained as quiet as usual, with no demand from any parties. The selling prices had no significant fluctuations. The current yarn price for 20-count Water Moon was 329 yuan, and the current yarn price for 20-count Blue Phoenix was 323.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Over One Thousand Pieces of Yarn Exported</p>
<p>Today, there are 250 pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Fuzhou, 90 pieces to Xiamen, 330 pieces to Hong Kong, 15 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 50 pieces to Haimen, 370 pieces to Haiphong, 90 pieces to Beihai.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories Replenish Raw Materials Domestic Cotton Sales See Activity Again</h3>
<p>Domestic cotton business has turned more active. This is because factories have recently opened up a particularly large amount of coarse and fine cotton yarn contracts, and naturally need to replenish raw materials. The inventory in Shanghai warehouses is especially scarce. This transaction has slightly improved the situation, and market prices should advance accordingly. The volume of transactions in the market is said to be quite large, but only five batches of transactions have been recorded. It is likely that there are many more that are kept secret and not made public. Today, the British firm Jardine Matheson was the most active in purchasing, with 1,000 bales of "Fire Machine" cotton. The remaining purchases by Xinsheng Factory were also continuous, but the quantity was very small. Selling prices were also seen to rise again. The source of supply from Subei was still not bad, with 1,457 bales of "Tonghua" arriving, as well as 200 pieces from Beisha, 150 pieces from Baimao, and 70 pieces from Xingang. There were 200 pieces exported to Fuzhou. The volume of current cotton transactions and market prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>American Cotton 76.60 Purchased by peers 100 bales Transferred via drafts, warehouse delivery</p>

<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market remained extremely sluggish, as the public deeply believed that the issue of selling cotton from Washington's loans would greatly affect the future of the cotton market. Therefore, everyone held a wait-and-see attitude. Market prices initially fell due to small reports from Liverpool and some Southern short selling, but then rebounded slightly due to small transactions by domestic manufacturers. As a result, at the close, prices fell by 3-6 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market was closed, and predictions remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton fell by over 10 points. Yesterday, exchange rates showed no improvement, and converted to legal currency, cotton prices all fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 5 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 3 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by 3 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Transactions in Shanghai foreign cotton remained quiet. Factories were all entering a state of suspension as the year-end was approaching. Recently, there has been a large arrival of American cotton. Yesterday, a steamer arrived with over 10,000 bales of American cotton, which are currently being processed through customs and can be sent to the factory for delivery before the New Year.

<h3>Piece Goods Prices Rise for Both Current and Futures Domestic Cloth The Accumulation of Eastern Piece Goods Remains Enthusiastic Large Quantities of Cloth Shipped to Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth prices for future contracts from various factories are generally high, and the market sentiment is quite firm. This is because the major closing period is approaching rapidly, and customer merchants are uniformly reducing their shipments. There is very little change in the various cloth markets. Those with ample funds among the local street peers have a strong intention to purchase cheap current goods on the market. Even for future contracts such as poplin, peers transfer them to each other with added profit, which is also very frequent. Customer sales are better in South China. The Guangdong gang purchased over eighty bales of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill from "Mountain Tiger", "Precious", "Yongfeng", and "Five Rats". The local street purchased over one hundred bales of various brands of fine twill and fine cloth. Fine twill is used for dyeing purposes, while fine cloth of brands such as "Dapeng" and "Peacock" is for wholesale distribution to Zhejiang and Anhui. Outside of white goods, colored cloth, bleached cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth are also purchased by Zhejiang and Jiangxi inlanders in quantities of over eight hundred bolts. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs continued to purchase over three thousand bolts of colored cloth, bleached silk, poplin, linen yarn, and printed cloth.</p>
<p>Customer sales of eastern cloth are gradually declining. However, the hoarding mentality of local street peers is becoming even more intense. Therefore, yesterday the transactions of current fine cloth and fine twill were around one thousand pieces, and selling prices were attractive, increasing by 2.5 fen per bolt. Various foreign firms continued to open four to five hundred pieces of futures contracts. The highest price for 12-pound Flying Fish fine cloth was 12.35 yuan, Longtou fine cloth was 12.2 yuan, and Blue Double Fish fine twill was 11.35 yuan, but the quantity per piece was not large.</p>
<p>Yesterday, one hundred and seventy-five pieces were shipped to Ningbo. Today's exports include eighty pieces to Yantai, two hundred pieces to Fuzhou, twenty-four pieces to Xiamen, sixty pieces to Hong Kong, forty-five pieces to Guangzhou Bay, one hundred and forty-five pieces to Haikou, and three hundred and twenty-five pieces to Beihai.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea For Domestic Use and Export Chekiang Silk Regains Momentum</h3>
<p>Foreign silk prices rose again yesterday. New York daily silk at 83.75 cents, each rose by 3 cents. Shanghai silk B character rose 4 cents, Guangdong silk rose 6 cents. The exchange market was not much up and down. Lyon daily silk rose 1 franc, Shanghai silk rose 1 franc to 2 francs. Guangdong silk rose 2.50 francs. Yokohama early market spot was slightly stagnant, opening at 927 yuan, forward at 908 yuan, a decline of 11 yuan to 13 yuan, but rebounded again in the afternoon, with the current period reopening at a high of 940 yuan.</p>
<p>In this city's transactions, British and French foreign firms temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Indian and African silk sales were quite lively yesterday, especially Chekiang silk, which was the most popular. It is estimated that Silver Fish opened at 975 yuan, and Python at 890 yuan, both following White Factory Jing's rise, soaring. The price of 800 yuan in the afternoon was not sold. It is estimated that the Indian bank opened 40 dan. The user silk market is still very tight, with RR White Factory selling at 1,525 yuan, and 81% White Factory priced at 1,560 yuan, beyond the reach of foreign firms. Therefore, the market situation may be high prices being cleared, while general users and hoarders, with the rise of Chekiang warp silk just beginning, are mostly shifting their interest to this. Therefore, it is predicted that if foreign firms still find it difficult to expand the price of White Factory warp silk, then the rising trend may be slightly curbed, while the future of Chekiang warp silk, due to the competitive purchase for export and domestic use, should still have the potential to rise further.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Chaozhou Youth Reports Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight. The guild's clearing price for number 24 Dutch coarse white current goods in local warehouses rose again by 1 jiao to 24.3 yuan. Transit goods were still priced at 16.2 yuan. Dagu Vehicle White B mark delivery was still lacking. The previous day it was already priced at 23.9 yuan, and yesterday it further rose to 24 yuan, a total increase of 3 jiao. This is because the goods of retail investors, when prices were falling, had all been sold off cheaply. When the situation turned around, major investors tightened their supply and released less, so the situation gradually improved. Domestic sugar transactions increased slightly. It is estimated that the Chaozhou gang opened up cotton red at 15.2 yuan to 15 yuan, and secondly at 14.8 yuan to 14 yuan, totaling over 300 bags. Zhiyang opened 300 plus bags at 16.1 yuan to 16 yuan, several dozen bags of Sanjian at 24.2 yuan, and over a hundred bags of ordinary Shantou white at 22 yuan to 21.8 yuan. The Guangdong gang opened Hainan red at 12.3 yuan to 2 jiao, and the Jian gang opened Dagon sugar at 22 yuan, and ordinary Mingjing red at 14.3 yuan, totaling several hundred bags. Only a hundred bags of new diao qing arrived, priced up by 4-5 jiao, but no transactions were made. It was also heard that the Shantou price of Chaozhou qing had risen again by 3-4 jiao, but the price of zhi red had shown a loosening trend.</p>
<p>On the 8th, six hundred and ninety bags of sugar and two hundred and sixty-nine boxes of longan were shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Fruits Shanghai People Have True Fortune A Large Quantity of Tangerines and Olives Arrive</h3>
<p>The end of the old lunar year and the beginning of the new year are approaching in a flash. Everyone is buying various fruits, especially tangerines, olives, and pears, which are most seasonal. Sales are increasing daily, and the fruit industry is purchasing large quantities from various places accordingly. Yesterday, the Taiyuan ship arrived from Xiamen, carrying a huge amount of over sixteen thousand three hundred buckets of honey tangerines. It is heard that a large quantity of Fuzhou tangerines and olives will also be shipped to the market in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Letter from a Reader Huashang Cement Does Not Pay Dividends Each Share Can Borrow Sixteen Yuan</h3>
<p>To the editor: I have seen in the commercial news column of your newspaper on the 8th of this month, that our company distributed an official dividend of 1.6% in the 26th year. The assets of our company's Longhua factory were already mortgaged and transferred to the German firm Zenchner. Since the withdrawal of the National Army from this city, our factory has been forcibly occupied by the Japanese. The Zenchner firm is still continuing negotiations. The losses suffered by the company have not yet been estimated, and the assets in the factory cannot be inventoried. Therefore, the accounts for the 26th year cannot be settled, and the shareholders' meeting has to be postponed. However, as the post-war life of the shareholders is becoming increasingly difficult, they have been requesting the distribution of the pre-war surplus for the 26th year. After discussion by the board of directors, it was believed that since the settlement for the 26th year has not been determined, it is difficult to mention distribution according to legal principles. However, the difficult situation of the shareholders should also be given special consideration. Therefore, it was resolved to temporarily allocate funds from the company's existing cash for lending, so that each shareholder can borrow 16 yuan in national currency per share, which will be deducted from the shareholders' annual dividends in the future. If the shareholders' meeting determines another deduction method, it will be handled according to the resolution of the shareholders' meeting. What your newspaper reported differs greatly from the facts, so I have specially sent this letter to inform you, and please check and correct it to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, The Shanghai Cement Co., Ltd.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Christian Middle Schools Most Schools in North China Continue to Open Schools in Fujian Province Relocate Inland Schools in Ningbo and Jiangsu Relocate and Reopen</h3>
<p>North China Within the North China region, except for four schools in Shanxi, half of which have been suspended and relocated, three schools in Shandong, with a few still suspended, and one or two schools in Hebei temporarily suspended, the rest have continued to operate and have returned to their original state. The number of students in general schools in Tianjin and Beijing is more than in 1937. Due to environmental factors, there have been slight changes in the curriculum. New subjects added include Japanese and moral education. Subjects removed include civics and Boy Scouts. Internal activities of the schools have also been greatly reduced due to various restrictions. However, religious activities have developed extraordinarily. In mid-December of last year, the middle schools in Beijing held an exhibition of religious teaching materials for middle schools in Beijing, with the aim of providing learning and promoting development. The religious activities of the schools in Tianjin are also quite active. Huiwen Middle School has established Bible study classes in each grade. In addition, there are organizations such as youth groups and fellowship meetings. The former focuses on literary evangelism and social service, while the latter focuses on prayer and spiritual cultivation. Faculty and staff hold a prayer meeting every Friday evening. When celebrities come to Tianjin, they are also specially invited to give lectures.</p>
<p>South China The number of Christian schools in Fujian Province is second only to Jiangsu. There are a total of forty-two schools in the province, concentrated in Xiamen and coastal counties. Although there are a few schools in the inland areas, most of them are elementary and junior high schools. During this war, the school authorities followed orders to relocate to safe areas. Xiehe University in Fuzhou has moved to Shaowu, the Huainan Women's College of Arts and Sciences and its affiliated middle school have moved to Nanping, a part of Yinghua Middle School remains in Fuzhou, and a part has moved to Shangyang. Wenshan Women's Middle School will move to Yangkou or Shuitai, Gezhi Middle School grades J3 and S2 have moved to Yongtai, and the rest remain in Fuzhou. Xiehe Elementary Normal School has moved to Yangkou, the Qingnianhui Commercial Vocational School has moved to Taikou, Sanyi Middle School has moved to Chong'an and established junior high and elementary schools. Tao Shu Women's Middle School plans to move to Gutian, and Yuying Women's Middle School, as it is a junior high school with young students, plans to move the third grade to Minqing, Liudu, or Gutian, and the rest will remain at the original school. Other schools in foreign counties, such as Peiying and Peiyuan in Quanzhou, have moved to Nanan Jiudu, Putian, Zheli, and if necessary, will move to Xiaxi. Changle Peiqing plans to move to northern Fujian. In short, most of the coastal schools in Fujian Province have moved inland, and those that have not moved are also preparing to do so. As for the schools in Xiamen, they have all moved to Gulangyu to hold classes. The principals have been replaced by Westerners, and the number of students has increased significantly. Although the area is a concession, the Japanese are about to overstep their bounds, causing the school's administrative facilities to be subject to constraints. The memorial week for the Prime Minister is not allowed to be held, and the civics course has also been suspended. History and geography are taught in a disguised manner in the library. All other patriotic activities have been completely stopped. All letters must be strictly inspected, and foreign newspapers cannot be imported. It is only possible to obtain accurate news about the war situation from foreigners. Daily morning meetings have been changed to religious ceremonies because they cannot impart knowledge about saving the country. The number of students in Christian schools in Fujian has increased significantly this year. Last year, there were 1,479 high school students and 4,307 junior high school students, totaling 5,786 people. This year, there are 1,980 high school students and 6,272 junior high school students, totaling 8,252 people, a difference of 2,466 people. The schools have been able to maintain themselves because of the increase in the number of students.</p>
<p>East China There are several notable aspects of the situation of Christian schools in East China: Within the guerrilla areas such as Nanjing and Suzhou, several schools have opened remedial schools in their original school buildings. There are many students and most of the teachers are former staff. Salaries are very low, but the teaching spirit is doubled. Starting this semester, all Western teachers are planning to go to their original places of service to engage in informal relief and religious work. Formal Christian schools are still continuing to operate in Shanghai or inland. All Chinese teachers will also advance and retreat with the schools where they teach. They will not return until the war is over. The East China Christian Education Association has organized a reading group for educational administrators this year. Many of the participants are principals of Christian middle schools and famous figures in the education field. They have met several times and are led by Huang Shijin and Zhao Chuanjia. The research center is focused on "the in-service training of middle school teachers," and the discussions are thorough and contribute greatly. The East China Education Association has organized teaching research groups for various subjects and has hired leaders for seven groups, including Chinese, English, mathematics, guidance, curriculum, home economics, and elementary education, and has separately convened teachers from various schools related to each subject for joint discussion. It also plans to convene a city-wide Christian teacher conference this summer to further discuss and promote the improvement of teaching methods.</p>
<h3>School Overview Dongya Middle School</h3>
<p>The Dongya Middle School, affiliated with the Dongya Physical Education College, was established in the 25th year of the Republic. It is located at Zhuotang Street, Luban Road, Nanshi. There were originally more than 130 students. However, after the outbreak of the war, it was moved to the China Vocational Education Society in Hualong Road, French Concession, and continued to operate. Most of the original students moved to the interior. Only a few dozen students continued to study at the school. However, due to the school's established reputation, students competed to apply for admission. By this year, the number has reached 300. During the year-end vacation, the first class of students has graduated. To facilitate students' further education, the Ministry of Education has been requested to add a senior high school general studies program. The number of teaching hours per week, whether for junior or senior high school, is higher than the regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Education. Emphasis is placed on the three subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics, in order to deeply cultivate the foundation of academic studies. The fees charged are very low. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are 20 yuan per semester for junior high school and 30 yuan for senior high school. Apart from self-provided books, no other fees are charged, which is especially convenient for students from poor families to further their education.</p>
<h3>World Student Fundraising to Aid Impoverished Chinese Students; Last Year, US$53,000 Was Raised and Sent to China; Ms. Tomlin Arrives from America to Investigate and Lecture</h3>
<p>According to Ms. Tomlin, an officer of the World Student Christian Federation, who spoke to reporters yesterday (the 7th), students worldwide are currently providing assistance to Chinese students who have become impoverished due to the current war of resistance. As a result of the global student effort last year, US$53,000 was raised. The target for this year has been set at US$94,760. This movement to aid impoverished Chinese students is jointly managed by two global student organizations: the Far Eastern Student Emergency Committee in the United States, and the International Student Service Association in Europe. The American group, led by Ms. Yaji, who visited China a few months ago, has raised US$18,000. The European group has collected 160,000 Swiss francs, equivalent to US$35,000. Several other student groups in various countries are also assisting with this fundraising campaign. The two committees managing the funds raised by students worldwide have been established in China, namely the National Student Relief Association of the YMCA and YWCA. As of the end of last month, the total expenditure of these two committees amounted to $100,402.38. Ms. Tomlin commented on the students in Shanghai, saying that her initial impression was that Shanghai students have a great capacity to enjoy life, and their vibrancy contains a deep enthusiasm and expectation to serve the country. In contrast, European students are the opposite, being extremely serious and lacking ingenuity. Ms. Tomlin further stated that she believes the Chinese people possess great perseverance and hope for the future of the nation, and she has not seen the Chinese people express the demeanor of a defeated people. Ms. Tomlin departed from her office in Geneva in the early autumn of last year, visited the United States for a short period, and arrived in Shanghai a week ago. She is scheduled to embark on the Empress of Russia today (the 8th), heading south to Chongqing. From March 6th, she will deliver lectures at the National YMCA training conference for three weeks, and will also visit student centers in the interior to obtain firsthand information about Chinese students, before returning to Europe to work.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Inspect Medical Education</h3>

<h3>Four Things in the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>— Ren Yi</p>
<p>After Shanghai became an isolated island, almost everything is exhibiting abnormal strange phenomena. According to Dr. Dai Jitao's explanation of the Three Principles of the People, he divides the people's livelihood issues into six major categories: this is naturally not enough to encompass the entire picture of Shanghai today, but at least it can provide a rough overview.</p>
<p>Clothing—Shanghai's streets were originally fashion shows, with everything from Chinese and Western styles to new and old styles. Now that the population is concentrated in the concessions, the patterns are even more complex. However, there is a particular trend: because many young masters, ladies, and mistresses have moved to Hong Kong in large numbers, the styles of all the new and strange clothing are no longer native Shanghai products, but rather imported goods from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Food—Affected by the war, perhaps many businesses have experienced sluggish decline. Only hotels, entertainment venues, and places to eat have seen great prosperity. From restaurants and hotels, constantly opening, to Laoda Fang and wild water chestnuts, who cares who is fake and who is real? Down to the small food stalls that set up tents, they are everywhere (referring to secluded places in busy streets). But so many places still do not have a share for the tens of thousands of starving refugees!</p>
<p>Housing—Living in crow's nest-like lane houses is now even more crowded! Naturally, this is an opportunity for every second landlord to make a fortune. Or, to put it another way, all second landlords can live off their rent. For example, a house rented for 40 yuan with sanitary facilities is usually calculated at three floors. Besides enjoying one floor for themselves, the remaining two floors can be rented for around 100 yuan. In this situation, it is no wonder that three or two families have to live in one small attic room.</p>
<p>Transportation—Transportation within the concessions was originally quite developed. After the war, many new routes were opened, and trams and buses increased their frequency. On holidays or during public or private business hours, many passengers are left sighing at the departing vehicles. Outside of this, it is all desolate ruins and tragic war scenes. If you do not have the so-called "Pass" and "Good Citizen Certificate," you may face mortal danger. Truly, you cannot go, brother!</p>
<h3>Experience in Tailoring</h3>
<p>— Tanbai</p>
<p>What garment makers fear most is customers doing the calculations, for when customers do the calculations, they have no way to steal materials. Therefore, those who make clothing must understand one or two things about the experience of tailoring. Relying on this, they can calculate face to face with the garment maker, so no matter how cunning he is, it will be difficult for him to cheat.</p>
<p>The method of calculation, for example, to make a mid-length robe, the length needs four feet, the sleeve opening needs two feet two inches. Using silk brocade with a width of two feet two inches, it needs to be calculated as two pieces of fabric that are eight feet one inch long, and one piece that is about three feet long. If the person wearing it is a small, thin person, the hem will not exceed one foot one inch, then its width will also not exceed one foot one inch. Therefore, this piece of fabric can be cut in half, calculating that eight feet of silk brocade is enough. Add two pieces of sleeve fabric and one piece of lining about three feet long, calculating that one zhang and one chi of clothing material is enough. The remaining fabric of about three feet can be used with the straight, small half to make the inner placket, and the large half to make the sleeve fabric. The sleeve width is about five inches, and two pieces only take about two feet, with a few inches of square material left over. As for the pockets and buttons, they can be made from the remaining material under the curved seam.</p>
<p>The above is a small tailoring method. A small tailoring method has a drawback, which is that for those with a plump figure, if the hem material exceeds one foot one inch, then the bottom must have corners added. To avoid this drawback, a large cut must be used. A large cut uses the original width of the material for cutting, so the sleeves can also be seamless, but only making one person will definitely cost a few more feet of clothing material. If two people can combine the order, it is not only economical but also aesthetically pleasing. Its method of making is that if the robe is four feet long, it must be made with a piece of fabric that is one zhang three chi to one zhang four chi long (this must be determined according to the size of the wearer's shoulder and cuffs). Fold it into three, and the upper and lower pieces are each four feet long, which is enough, because the middle piece needs half of the two sleeves. Its length must be determined by the size of the shoulder. If the shoulder needs eight inches, then the middle piece is four feet eight inches long, plus the upper and lower two pieces each four feet, totaling one zhang two feet eight. After cutting, the upper and lower pieces each have a surplus, and these two pieces can be used as small collars. However, one small collar is already enough, so the other piece is useless; calculating that the material used is already two or three feet. But if the order is combined, two people can save this, because only two more middle pieces are needed, and the remaining material from the upper and lower pieces can be used as small collars for both people.</p>
<p>In addition, cutting jacket material and women's material is the same, only the lengths are different. Pants material is the length from the waist to the ankle for two pieces, plus the crotch calculation. Understand and be aware, and you will never be deceived by garment makers again.</p>

<h3>Weekly Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>In last week's menu, I offered Fried Two Winters to the readers of this publication. Speaking of winter mushrooms, this thing has many uses. In addition to stir-frying with winter bamboo shoots, which is popular, winter mushrooms stir-fried with cabbage hearts is also a valuable vegetarian dish that can be added to formal banquets. This week, I will introduce another very unique dish, called Meat Patty Stuffed with Winter Mushrooms. The method is very simple, without any complicated procedures. Everyone can try it. First, follow the method of making meatballs. Chop the pork finely, add good soy sauce, and knead into meatballs. Then, choose whole winter mushrooms, and stuff each one with a meatball, gently pressing it flat with your fingers to turn it into the shape of a meat patty. Then, put them in a bowl and steam them in a rice cooker. The taste is fragrant, fresh, and delicious. Although this dish is somewhat aristocratic and does not fit the label of this menu, doing it occasionally each week is ultimately cheaper than eating chicken and duck. Just be moderate with your chopsticks and don't gobble it down like a glutton. Then a bowl of twenty can provide enough for a meal.</p>

<h3>House Cleaning Methods</h3>
<p>Xiao Hei</p>
<p>1. Cleaning method for wood</p>
<p>Indoor wooden pillars, walls, and doors and windows are most susceptible to dirt. If we often paint them, it will not only cost a lot but also feel very troublesome. However, simply washing with water cannot completely restore their old appearance. If we use a solution of caustic soda to wash them, we can receive unexpected results! As for how to wash them, it is to dissolve one part of caustic soda (available in pharmacies) in one hundred parts of water, and use a broom to take this solution and scrub it. After cleaning, wash it with water, and it will appear very clean. However, in very dirty situations, we need to reduce the water and turn it into one part of caustic soda dissolved in fifty parts of water, then any dirt can be removed. Dear readers, this is a very economical and convenient method. Why not try it!</p>
<p>2. Method of wiping glass</p>
<p>Dust on glass windows and doors is very unsightly, but wiping glass is indeed a troublesome task, especially after it rains, the glass windows are covered with many water droplets, which is even more unsightly. However, after it rains is the best time to wipe the glass, because on the one hand, it can save the trouble of wiping with a wet cloth, and on the other hand, it will not cause the water droplets to stick to dust. But in addition to this method, we can purchase stain-removing powder and apply it to the glass, and then wipe it with a dry cloth, which is also a good method.</p>

<h3>The Doom of Spain</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>It is not yet possible to make a definitive statement as to whether the Spanish Republican government is about to collapse. However, its great defeat, which has led to a crisis of collapse, is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for its great defeat? Are the troops inferior to Franco's? Is the military strategy less astute than Franco's? Is the assistance of the democratic countries less active than that of Italy? True, these are all important reasons for its great defeat. However, if it did not have the following one reason, I believe it would never have been so greatly defeated. On the contrary, it might still have been able to achieve a great victory. The only reason is that the autonomous regions under the Republican government each governed themselves, refusing to help each other, and even more unwilling to obey the commands of the central government, rising up to carry out an all-out resistance. As a result, Franco had an opportunity to take advantage of, and carry out piecemeal attacks.</p>
<p>If the Basque Country, Asturias, and now Catalonia, had initially united and obeyed the central government, then the outcome of the war would probably not yet be determined.</p>
<p>Between countries, especially weaker ones facing stronger ones, the only way to rise up in resistance and strike back at the aggressor is to unite and resist on all fronts. Otherwise, the strong will inevitably triumph, and the weak will inevitably be destroyed. In ancient times, we can find evidence in the alliances and counter-alliances of the Warring States period. Today, we can take Spain as a warning.</p>
<p>Therefore, when China resisted Japan in the early stages, it failed to mobilize the nation's strength, resulting in the loss of the Northeast. Since the July 7th Incident, there was also the blunder of Han Fuju, who missed the opportunity. It was not until August 13th, when the flames of war ignited in Shanghai, that we gained the upper hand. The subsequent retreats and resistances were merely the gradual implementation of the overall plan. Now, we have a complete grasp of victory, and there is no room for doubt. Tracing back the reason, the most important thing is that we were able to recover from our initial setbacks and unite early on, under the leadership of the central government, to carry out a united resistance.</p>
<p>If the Spanish Republican army immediately united and persevered, I think the final outcome would still be uncertain. The situation has not yet reached an irreversible point. Turning danger into safety is not without hope. Otherwise, the doom of Spain is self-inflicted: "One who commits evil will not survive," only to be lamented by later historians!</p>
<h3>Traces of a Dream in the Three Platforms</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——A Narrative on National Novels</p>
<p>When Emperor Yingzong and Emperor Jingzong of the Ming Dynasty, encountered the invasion of Esen, it was precisely a reflection of the current enemy. Repeatedly demanding bribes, never being satisfied; looking down on China, thinking it could be taken in one battle, it was not until Yu Qian resisted in the capital that they realized China was indeed not to be insulted, and suffered a major setback. Volume 8 of "West Lake Anecdotes," "Traces of a Dream in the Three Platforms," is dedicated to writing about Yu Qian's life. Most of the description is based on the Biography of Yu Qian in the History of the Ming Dynasty, Volume 170. However, the anecdotes about Yu Qian's childhood at the beginning are taken from legends. Even the clay statues were afraid of Yu Qian. Being sent to Lingnan in exile was frightening, and being ordered to kneel could only be obeyed. We often see this kind of story in the "Lost Hongwu Stories" compiled by Lin Lan. As for speaking eloquently and being quick-witted in matching couplets, that can also be seen in Lin Lan's "Stories of Interesting Couplets." As for specifically talking to monks in couplets, that was only because there were these two sentences in the Biography: "A monk marveled at him, saying, 'He will be a prime minister who saves the times!'" In "Traces of a Dream in the Three Platforms," it is: The monk said, "Gentlemen, do not laugh, this child has extraordinary bones and speaks eloquently. He will be a prime minister who brings order out of chaos!"</p>
<p>Regarding Yu Qian's defense of the capital against Esen, both the Biography in the History of the Ming Dynasty and Volume 8 of "West Lake Tour Records" have records. The History of the Ming Dynasty is better, not as pedantic as the Records: The description of the battlefield is also more vivid in the History of the Ming Dynasty, not as weak as the Records. The time was October of the first year of the Jingtai reign. The History of the Ming Dynasty states: "Esen, holding the Emperor Emeritus hostage, broke through Zijing Pass and directly entered to spy on the capital. Some suggested a compromise, withdrawing the troops, and strengthening the walls to wear him down. Yu Qian disagreed, saying, 'How can we show weakness and make the enemy despise us more!' He immediately dispatched generals leading an army of 220,000, arrayed outside the nine city gates. He opened all the city gates and personally supervised the battle, issuing an order: 'If a general is unwilling to retreat before the army, behead the general; if a soldier disregards the general and retreats first, the rear team will execute the front team.' Thus, the officers and soldiers knew they would surely die and all exerted their utmost. Initially, Esen penetrated deeply, viewing the capital as something that could be taken in an instant. But upon seeing the government troops standing in strict array, his intention was slightly discouraged. The traitor Xi Ning incited him to invite the ministers to welcome the Emperor Emeritus, demanding gold and condolences in the hundreds of millions. The Emperor did not allow it, and Esen's spirit was further dampened. On the gengshen day, the enemy spied on Desheng Gate. Yu Qian ordered Heng to set an ambush in empty houses, leaving a few cavalry to lure the enemy. The enemy came with ten thousand cavalry. Vice General Fan Guang fired firearms, and the ambush rose up and attacked together. Esen's brother was shot and killed. The enemy chased to Shicheng Gate, and the residents went up to the roofs, shouting and throwing bricks to attack the enemy. The clamor shook the heavens. Reinforcements arrived, and the enemy retreated. After holding out for five days, Esen's invitation was not answered, and the battle was unfavorable. Knowing that he would ultimately not achieve his goal, he took the Emperor Emeritus westward. Yu Qian ordered the generals to pursue to the pass and then return. He was awarded the title of Junior Protector and General Supervisor of Military Affairs." (Excerpt) As for the text of "Traces of a Dream in the Three Platforms," I think it is not necessary to quote it extensively here.</p>
<p>Two points in the above excerpt are worth noting. First, Esen "viewed the capital as something that could be taken in an instant." This is similar to the enemy's assessment of Taierzhuang. Only after suffering setbacks did they sigh and say, "Unexpectedly, little Taierzhuang is so difficult!" Second, the masses ascended to the roofs to resist with bricks and stones, achieving success. This further demonstrates the necessity of arming the people. If the whole country were soldiers and could fight everywhere, then the enemy would be impossible to defend against and would ultimately collapse.</p>
<p>Yu Qian's patriotism can be seen in Volume 8 of the Records: "During the Jingtai reign, there were northern expeditions and southern campaigns, with numerous military affairs. Yu Qian often judged several matters in a day, and would not stop until late at night. He would then pat his chest and say, 'Where shall this heart's blood be spilled!'"</p>
<p>There are five of his poems in Volume 11 of the Spring Records of the Ming Dynasty. The Records also include fragments of poems, such as his poem on Su Wu: "If wealth and honor come, do not ask; a loyal heart repays the country, that is a man." And: "Do not laugh at my bleak traveling bag; I alone leave my sword leaning against the blue sky." Both "can know his lonely and aloof character" and "his spirit of loyalty and integrity."</p>
<p>The poems of Ming people commemorating Yu Qian include Huang Fengxiang's more famous "Visiting the Shrine of Junior Protector Yu": "The nine tripods are as steady as mountains, and the dust of the border is as quiet as being rolled away." Also, Yang Zhuo's "Worshipping the Tomb of Duke Zhongsu of Yu": "Recalling the events of the Jingtai reign, he supported the heavens with one hand and helped heaven to punish. Iron cavalry filled the Simamen, and spears swept outside Juyong Pass."</p>
<p>A certain gentleman's "Soul of the Chinese Nation for Five Thousand Years" (?) lists Yu Qian as one of the four pillars, alongside Xie An, Li Gang, and Yu Yunwen, showing the utmost admiration.</p>
<p>Novels about Yu Qian also include Bi Gaoliang's "Complete Biography of Yu Junior Protector Zhong," in ten volumes and forty chapters. There is also a Ming person's "Authentic Biography" that scolds Yu Qian. The former exists while the latter is lost, showing that "public opinion is fair."</p>
<h3>Unresponsive to Requests</h3>
<h3>Orderly</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——Impressions of Travel in the War Zone</p>
<p>An officer's wife asked me why I didn't have an orderly. I said, "I originally had one orderly, but he died in battle in Nanjing. Since returning south from Shanxi, I have deeply felt that using orderlies is unreasonable." What I meant to tell her was, "It's understandable to ask an orderly to do some official military business in the army; but it's not right to have an orderly act as a servant for an officer's wife." Not long after, her orderly "deserted" and left on his own. She was furious and said, "Was I not treating him well enough? When playing cards, the initial winnings were his! The food and clothing, were no different from others. Look at those soldiers, in this weather, aren't they shivering from the cold!" Because I had known her for a long time, I told her frankly, "Madam, this is what you don't understand: you say he lacked nothing, but he lacked two of the most important things—'hope' and 'glory.' There is not much hope in being an officer's orderly, and even less hope in being an officer's wife's orderly; it is not glorious to be an officer's orderly, and even less glorious to be an officer's wife's orderly. Think about it: even if he had hope and was promoted to a junior officer, others would say privately that he used to be an orderly for so-and-so's wife. Where would he put his face? I don't know about others, but I myself would rather starve or freeze to death than be an orderly, unless my lover became an officer, she became Mu Guiying, and I became Yang Zongbao." They all laughed at each other when they heard this.</p>
<p>My younger brother Li, who has lived in the army for many years, once summarized the feelings of people in the army towards orderlies: "Every five hundred years there must be a Wang Laoxing (a lazy and unreliable character), but it is difficult to find a good orderly in a thousand years!" The difficulty of finding the right person for an orderly seems to be even greater than finding a Premier of the Executive Yuan. On closer inspection, it is not that it is difficult to find the right person for an orderly; the system of orderlies itself is fundamentally wrong. Those who curse the orderlies say that the clever ones will be mischievous, take advantage of situations, and have affairs with the officer's wife, doing everything imaginable; the honest ones are as stupid as oxen, and everything has to be prodded and moved, always causing frustration. But examining all the tasks of an orderly, when the officer was not yet successful, they were all taken care of by himself, and there is no reason why he cannot take care of them himself after becoming an officer. And those orderlies who serve the officer's wife are actually just saving the wife the cost of a maid, and to put it bluntly, they are also taking advantage of public resources to benefit themselves, which is completely inappropriate. The reason why the officer's wife wants to use an orderly, saving money is certainly one reason, but the main reason is to show that she is an officer's wife, which is also a very wrong mentality.</p>
<p>When we lived the life of following the army, we agreed to take care of our own minor affairs and cultivate the habit of serving ourselves; the result of this habit was very good, and sometimes mutual service could even enhance deep friendship. I often say that if bureaucratic politics is not broken, there is no hope of nation-building. To break bureaucratic politics, we must first break the "bourgeois" concept of masters and mistresses.

<h3>Rushing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wall Grass</p>
<p>The three of us were "captives."</p>
<p>A group of nineteen in total. The distances were very uneven: several people were crowded together, because the path was narrow, and they were afraid of slipping into the rice paddies; some were scattered far apart by a dozen steps.</p>
<p>The sky in September was gloomy, very melancholy. Not long after starting, it began to drizzle again. The steps of the crowd inevitably quickened. The people in the back always complained that the people in the front were walking too slowly, and shouted sternly from time to time: "Walk faster! Walk faster!"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I happened to have a sore on my foot, and my leather shoes were tight, causing a dull ache. My steps seemed more wobbly than everyone else's, and sometimes I couldn't help but stop to bend down and loosen my shoelaces. The petty policeman with the fine white pockmarks who was assigned to watch over me would often nag:</p>
<p>"Hmph, isn't it intentional? As slow as a snail, are you trying to find an opportunity to escape?"</p>
<p>I glared at him with hostility and slowed down my pace even more. He was annoyed and bumped my shoulder hard:</p>
<p>"You really want to escape? See if you have the guts! Try it! Hmph!"</p>
<p>This time, I ignored him, knowing that if I flared up, I would inevitably suffer even more, so I had to slowly increase my pace.</p>
<p>"That's right," he snorted again in his nose, quite pleased with himself.</p>
<p>The raindrops gradually became larger, and everyone's clothes were soaked through, feeling a shivering cold. I swept back my messy hair and wrung out a handful of water. The ground was even more muddy and tiring, and you would surely stumble several times if you weren't careful.</p>
<p>The one at the back of the line was a buck-toothed guy with a beard, probably a fake patrol officer. At a quick glance, you would almost mistake him for a ×× person.</p>
<p>He was panting like a fat pig, sweat continuing to trickle down his forehead, so he kept taking out a handkerchief from his clothes to wipe it away, while vaguely shouting like an ox:</p>
<p>"Faster! Brothers!" He scolded those who were walking slower, "Move forward and shorten the distance!"</p>
<p>"Faster!" The petty policeman with the fine white pockmarks echoed spiritedly.</p>
<p>"It's walking with feet!"</p>
<p>It was the voice from the front, muttering very softly, the buck-toothed guy probably didn't hear it, so he was still the same: "Faster! Faster!" He seemed very anxious, worried about something going wrong on the road.</p>
<p>When passing through villages, some people looked at us with surprised eyes, but when they saw the fake policemen carrying guns fiercely, they all shrank back in fear. Dogs, in groups, followed us and barked madly.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye couldn't help but stick out her tongue and say:</p>
<p>"I can't bear the hardships of following your army!"</p>
<p>Before Regiment Commander Ye could answer, his two steel-like arms were suddenly grabbed by his younger brother Fang Ying and younger sister Fang Hui on either side. Fang Hui said with a girl's unique charming attitude, acting spoiled and coquettish:</p>
<p>"Brother, you promised to go to the front with us a long time ago, but you never did it. Now that the enemy is about to attack, when are you finally going with us? We are willing to go to the national crisis with you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye hurriedly scolded:</p>
<p>"Fang Hui, don't make trouble! What are you, a girl, going to the front for? Besides, we are all discussing escaping, but you want to go to the front, what does that mean?"</p>
<p>"It's called going to the national crisis together," Fang Hui still said charmingly. "I don't think you can escape even if you want to, so it's better to go to the national crisis together."</p>
<p>Mr. Ye threw the remaining paper coal on the ground, stamped out the fire, and nodded:</p>
<p>"That makes sense, but the matter of going to the national crisis is still something that you young people do well, we old people can't do it. Now that the country is so critical, I won't stop you young people from dedicating your lives, my only hope is to leave me with this child Fang Wen, to inherit the incense of my Ye family."</p>
<p>"You...you..." Mrs. Ye was so angry that she couldn't speak, she just pointed her finger at Mr. Ye.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye was asking his younger brother and sister:</p>
<p>"You want to go to the front, I don't know if you can stand the air there? There are gun smoke and bullets in the air twenty-four hours a day, hearing the firecrackers booming straight over, bullets whizzing and flying around, airplanes constantly circling overhead, and bombs rumbling and being dropped. This is not something that can be done with some military training."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, just take us with you." Fang Ying said in a very firm tone.</p>
<p>"Good!" Regiment Commander Ye said this, then turned back to his father and said: "I think it's good to take them with me, I had planned it a long time ago. Younger brother Ying can help me with political propaganda work, training soldiers and the people, and younger sister Hui can rescue wounded soldiers, which is better than leaving them at home."</p>
<p>"Fang Jun," Mrs. Ye cried out in an almost weeping voice: "Don't listen to their childish talk, I won't let them go no matter what, I don't even trust you, let alone them."</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye impatiently waved his hand at his mother, then lowered his head and said to his younger brother and sister: "But now I can't take you with me. Now the military situation at the front is urgent, taking you with me will not only not help me, but will instead be a burden to me." (Eight)</p>

<p>According to Chaplin, in his new film "The Great Dictator," when he plays the role of the dictator, he will try his best to imitate the German dictator in terms of the haircut and the fake mustache. The start of this film is undoubtedly a kind of revenge by Chaplin for Germany banning the showing of his slapstick films.</p>
<p>Chaplin has always been against sound films, the reason being that actors opening their mouths. When "City Lights" was being filmed, sound films were popular, and silent films had long disappeared, but he still filmed a silent film. Although "Modern Times" is a sound film, Chaplin has never opened his mouth, insisting on his promise not to speak on the screen. If he makes an exception this time in "The Great Dictator," to what extent will his humor be when he opens his mouth? It is worth pondering!</p>
<p>At the time when German-American relations broke down, it is said that several other films that were anti-German, anti-Nazi, and anti-Fascist were being filmed or planned at the same time as Chaplin's "The Great Dictator." It is probably the first time that Hollywood film companies have such a strong interest in filming films with political overtones!</p>
<p>Paulette Goddard, who divorced Chaplin not long after they lived together and played the heroine in "Modern Times," encountered the pain of a relationship change off-screen and has not met us on the screen for a long time. But just as Chaplin announced the start of filming "The Great Dictator," Hollywood spread the news that she would star in a new film called "Dramatic School."</p>
<h3>Qing Dingzhu Xiao En's Crying Voice</h3>
<p>— Quechang</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan Follows Good Advice; No Longer Uses It</p>
<p>Qing Dingzhu (i.e., The Fisherman's Revenge) is a play full of revolutionary colors, and its arrangement is so compact that it can be said to be all excellent. When Tan Beile (Xinpei) and Wang Yaoqing cooperated in the beginning, it was truly unprecedented and unsurpassed, wonderfully to the extreme. After Mr. Tan's death, of course Yu Shuyan is the best. Although Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying often use this play to promote themselves, they are still not skilled enough to be just right. If the whole play is to be critiqued, a special book can be published, and it is by no means this small place that can be finished. Therefore, I will now only say a few words about the scene of killing the family. After Guiying finished singing the original rhythm, Xiao En was rebuked and returned home to sing a section of swaying rhythm. I heard from the elders that when Mr. Tan sang the sentence "Helplessly gritting his teeth, I hurriedly hurried home," he did not use a crying voice, but rather raised the word "hurried" high and slightly used a small voice. But the first time I heard Yu Shuyan sing this sentence, he used a very moving crying voice. Later, when I heard Ma Lianliang sing, it was also like this. At that time, because I thought it sounded good, I thought it should be sung like this. As for the singing method of Mr. Tan said by the elders, I thought it was a false rumor. Once at the house of my relative Zhu Xingyuan (Mr. Zhu and Mr. Tan were close friends, and he had a great research on Mr. Tan's plays. The drum used by Mr. Tan to scold Cao still exists in the Zhu mansion. Shuyan entrusted people several times to want this drum, but Mr. Zhu refused to give it up because it was given by an old friend.), I had a conversation with Shuyan. At first, we talked about some stories about the play, and then I raised this question to ask Shuyan.</p>
<p>Whether the sentence "hurriedly hurried home" in The Fisherman's Revenge was sung with a crying voice by Mr. Tan? Shuyan was considered good and did not mind my presumptuous question. He said very frankly that Mr. Tan indeed did not use a crying voice. I only changed to singing with a crying voice to increase emotion and tension in the play. After I listened, I had not yet answered, but Mr. Zhu interjected and said, Shuyan, your view is wrong. I don't care whether Mr. Tan sang with a crying voice in the beginning, just talk about the plot of the play. Is Xiao En a great hero? When he met Ni Rong, he still showed the spirit of being old but strong in the test of strength. When he used martial arts with the teachers, he especially showed his arrogant spirit. With such a great hero, how could he not even bear these forty big boards, but ended up crying and returning home? This is really scolding the great hero badly! If you understand this point, I advise you to change it. After I listened at that time, I was naturally awakened from a dream and nodded non-stop. Even Yu Shuyan listened and praised him extremely at that time, and said a sentence "Mr. Zhu, you really have it, I admire you! I will change it, I will change it" After this conversation, in less than a few months, I actually heard again in a society play.</p>
<p>Yu Mei cooperated in Qing Dingzhu. When it came to this scene, I paid special attention. When I heard it, he really changed to singing a high voice, and no longer cried. At that time, I recalled Mr. Zhu's words again, and then I researched the current situation on stage. I felt that singing like this was really much stronger than crying. Because singing a high voice can show the frustration and grievance of a hero, containing infinite feelings of terror and anger, which is in line with Xiao En's identity, and coincides with the plot of the play. If he cries, it will show Xiao En's incompetence, embarrassment, and weakness. How can he later be determined to kill the entire Ding family? I very much admire Yu Shuyan's ability to follow good advice. By the way, I also advise Ma Lianliang to change it as soon as possible. As for Tan Fuying - I have heard it once, and he did not use a crying voice. Tan's literary grandson is different after all.</p>

<h3>A Tragic Script "Thunderstorm" Adapted into an Opera</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Yu, China's most outstanding playwright, first crystallization "Thunderstorm" since its publication, caused a sensation, not only won the praise of thousands of audiences in the country, but also once red in foreign countries. Two years ago, it was staged many times in Japan, and the box office was not bad, and now the original text has been translated into English, Japanese and other languages.</p>
<p>It has been staged in various places in China, I do not know how many times, and has been filmed into a movie and released. Now according to the news from Batavia, South Yang, the local "China Travel Song and Dance Drama" plans to adapt "Thunderstorm" into an opera with songs and dances, as well as the prepared music, and put it on the opera stage, turning a work with literary value into an opera. This is still China's first initiative. I hope that Zheng Shi, the director and screenwriter of "China Travel Opera Troupe," does not spoil the original work's worth.</p>
<h3>Theater Diary</h3>
<p>— Xuchu</p>
<p>February 3rd. Today is the engagement day of the famous Kunqu opera artist Gu Chuanjie and the Kunqu amateur Zhang Yuanhe. After the wedding feast, there was still some revelry. After a few friends sang some Peking Opera, it was Zhu Chuanming and Gu Chuanjie's "Selling the Horse". Some guests shouted loudly at Chuanjie, "Please sing 'Dressing Up and Kneeling by the Pond'!" So Chuanjie made a gesture of thanks, and the guests burst into laughter. Then, someone enthusiastically requested Miss Zhang to sing; Miss Zhang hurriedly escaped into the room, and was finally persuaded to come out by Miss Li Xun. Miss Li clapped her hands and bowed her head, smiling, leading the way. So Miss Zhang sang a song from "The Red Pear Record: Meeting at the Pavilion". Chuanjie stood in the front row of the stage, smiling and listening quietly. Perhaps this song was enough to evoke their sweet memories, so that's why she loved the pavilion scene so much? After listening to the duet of "Peony Pavilion: Strolling in the Garden" by the Pan Mao sisters, I happily went home; I wish Chuanjie and Yuanhe a happy life as artists, as beautiful as peonies.</p>
<p>February 5th. Watched Ms. Yunhui perform "Wujia Slope" and "The Grand Ascent to the Throne." Her voice was very loud, and the sudden shifts to lower tones were also subtle and expressive. Such a voice is not only rare among female amateurs, but probably also among professional actors? The movements and steps of fleeing with a basket were very beautiful, like a famous painting. Finally, the thirteen "naha chi" sounds were also very pleasant to hear, as round as pearls and as crisp as silver bells.</p>
<p>Yunhui's photo in costume</p>
<p>February 6th. Attended the Zhou Shou Tong Le Hui in the evening. The most worthwhile to appreciate was Kong Ming of Tang Dalang in "Crossing the River for the Feast", full of humorous tricks. For example, after kneeling on the cushion, he threw it two zhang high, setting a new record for throwing cushions; his voice was especially better than Qilin Tong, no wonder the friends upstairs shouted, "Tang Dalang, give us a 'Chasing Han Xin'!" When entering the stage, looking back, he was full of charm, like a young female performer; suddenly, his right hand could not come out of his large sleeve, and he busily used his left hand to grope for it; when sitting quietly, he looked around, or looked up at the friends upstairs: the amount of applause was the most for Dalang. Lingxi's six children saw their father playing Lu Su on stage, and suddenly transforming into Uncle Beard, and were especially interested.</p>
<p>February 27th. Saw the spoken drama "Tears on Flowers" at the Carlton. The author Yu Ling is truly like Ibsen, especially sympathetic to the fate of insulted and injured women. This play will be performed for six consecutive nights starting today. When I saw the dancer Mimi talk about her stepmother whipping her and searching her for banknotes, I almost shed tears. At the same time, I remembered the movie "Street Angel" written and directed by Yuan Muzhi. Men often play with women, and when they are tired of them, they throw them away, like discarding old shoes; Mimi's insult by Chang Haicai and another dancer's deception by Xiao Chen are common occurrences in the present society. So, how should they walk their path in the future? I think the respectable women on the solitary island will definitely have a good answer after watching this play.</p>

<h3>Wang Huichan Dedicates Herself to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Recently, among female performers, those who change to life in front of the camera are becoming increasingly popular, and those engaged in the film industry are even more widely recruiting and competing to hire them, which is a major change in both the acting and film circles. Yesterday, at a banquet hosted by my old friend Ma Yili, I met the female performer Wang Huichan, who is also about to dedicate herself to the silver screen.</p>
<p>Wang Huichan (also known as Guizhen) is the daughter of the famous Shanghai qin player Wang Baishui. She is just twenty-eight years old, with a beautiful appearance, intelligent and clever, and is a cousin of the film artist Yuan Meiyun. She used to study singing with the famous Peking amateur Shen Tangqing in Beiping, following the style of Yao Qing, and resembling her in spirit. Enthusiasts all regard her as a little Wang Yaoqing. She is capable of performing many plays. Last year, she performed continuously at the fundraising drama, winning the attention of actors and amateurs from all sides, and was praised as a rising star. Recently, she was hired by a certain stage as a pillar, and those with a penchant for Zhou Lang flocked to her, often filling the seats. Later, due to a small matter of salary, she suddenly stopped performing. After Yuan Meiyun persuaded her, going back and forth several times, she finally succeeded.</p>
<p>Huichan also has a strong interest in the camera, and believes that it is easier to express her ambitions in front of the camera, and can make some contributions to society, unlike the acting industry, which is only for others to make money. It is said that she will play an important role in the film "Mulan", and her bright future can be expected.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden of the Former Capital (100)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Male Roles, Two Female Roles, and Two Painted-Face Roles: True Fighting and True Cursing Due to Jealousy</p>
<p>In a performance of "Nian Gengyao," He Zongbing, played by Yue Shan, (that is, the father of the thirteenth sister He Yufeng) and Yue Zhongqi, was played by Gai Jiaotian at the same time. One day, Gai Laowu deliberately played a trick, saying that he had something to ask someone to ask for leave from the stage manager, so that someone else could play his role first. If he finished the matter and had time, he would rush to join the back team. Fortunately, the costume and appearance of Yue Zhongqi in this play were similar to those of Zhang Jiaxiang in the play "Iron Rooster". With black rouge smeared on his face, it was even harder to recognize his original appearance. When the two sides started fighting, who knew that Gai Laowu was also hiding on the side, dressed up, just waiting for He Yueshan to have already fought several rounds, and was a little tired, he suddenly rushed out, ignoring everything, and not following the routines they had rehearsed backstage, just desperately fighting for real. Daoshan originally knew that Gai Laowu had asked for leave, and never thought that he would come out halfway and knock the confused duck unconscious. To talk about the two people's martial skills, they were both very well-grounded, but Yueshan had already been tired for several rounds, and besides, he was usually close to women, and his body had long been damaged; moreover, this time, one was deliberately looking for trouble, using all his strength, and shaking up all his spirit, while the other was full of doubts, as if in a five-mile fog. This fierce fight between the two not only made the people watching the stage dumbfounded, and the cheers and applause were like thunder, but also the drummers on the stage were also like crazy, drumming to cheer them on. This lasted for more than half an hour without stopping, but later, Yueshan's strength finally weakened, and he was accidentally knocked down on the stage by Gai Laowu, and he spit out a few mouthfuls of blood and passed out. As the saying goes, people in the same profession are enemies. Since Gai Jiaotian defeated He Yueshan, his reputation grew day by day, and he later became a leader in short-hitting martial artists, and even now, there is no one else in the North and South. His "Wu Song Fights the Shop", "San Cha Kou", "Qiankun Circle", etc. are light and clean, and the "Land Thirteen Sounds" when exploring the village in "Evil Tiger Village" is also extremely beautiful, similar to Xiao Huang's. However, he later liked to add headdresses to a good play, dragging out the time, which is inevitably a superfluous act and is not favored by connoisseurs.</p>
