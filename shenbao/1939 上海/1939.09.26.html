<h3>美國中立法修正問題</h3>
<p>美國傳統的對外國策，隨着地域而分為三方面：對歐，主張中立。儘可能不捲入戰爭漩渦；對遠東，堅持門戶開放，機會均等；對美洲，排斥外來勢力，即貫澈「門羅主義。」國策隨時勢的動盪，時見波折，但其實質固定不變。兩年以來，遠東發生戰事，美國把握其遠東政策，在剛柔並濟之中。最近歐戰不幸而又爆發，美國的中立政策乃又遇到最嚴重的試騐。至於在美洲，德日諸國對墨西哥以及中南美洲，早有陰謀活動；而加拿大對德宣戰後，使美國立刻感覺到戰事狀態延及北鄰。國際如此錯綜複雜，美國怎樣才能站在漩渦之外，而兼顧其整個國策的三方面，這是美國當局所苦思焦慮的。</p>
<p>目前，國際視綫集中於美國國會特別會議中的中立法修正問題。關於美國現行中立法的種種缺點，本報早已有所指陳。（見本年一月七日及三月十一日社評）；羅斯福總統竭力主張修改，俾得一面保持中立，而一面制裁侵略，苦心孤詣，值得推崇。今日請就中立法在本屆特別會議中能否實行修正問題，以及修正後對於遠東局面的影響，略加剖析。</p>
<p>我們先應明暸的，中立法修正與吾，無關美國國策；即使修正案竟爾失敗，決非美國國策推翻了傳統精神而採行孤立主義，只能看做共和黨政戰的勝利。換句話說，　前的中立法修改問題已由外交政策問題轉變而為民主共和兩黨的政爭問題，和今年年初的情形已顯有不同。但以我們觀察，中立法極有修改的可能：（一）中立法雖具避免牽入戰爭漩渦的意義，而其影響所及，却使美國工商業蒙其重大的利害。汽車大王福特曾說「惟一希望修改中立法者，乃欲藉此大規模製造軍火，以圖利潤」云云，雖未免過甚其辭，却亦道破一斑。即羅斯福總統亦曾公開說明「中立法修正案擱淺，似於工商各業有害」。自本年五月三十日「現購自運」條款作廢後，美國對於任何交戰國皆絕對不能輸出軍火，此事在政治意義上足以鼓勵希特勒而使英法失望，固不待論，而在經濟的意義上，自非美工商業所能容忍。所以我們可以想像，美國的軍火商，財閥，以及一般的工商業必不免向國會議員施以强大的壓力。（二）自歐戰發生後，美國的民間輿論，主張修正中立法的日益强硬，全國報界除赫斯脫一系外，亦莫不為羅斯福總統作後盾；美國是民治國家，民意實有權威。（三）上决修正案在參議院外交委員會表決時，僅以一票之差而至擱淺；而且參議員中主張緩議的，亦多以歐戰不致爆發為假定，現在歐戰不僅爆發，且有延長與擴大之勢，所以假定的前提不復存在。</p>
<p>所可顧慮的，中立法修改問題已不幸而形成為政爭的工具。本來，中立法應吾修改，利害何似，見仁見智，各有不同。雙方在國會中的辯論，早已舌敝唇焦，各議員除少數所謂「死硬派」外，亦早已習聞而厭，以為修正也好不修正也好，絕無成見。惟有那些「死硬派」與反對政府派乘機活動，竭力宣傳說，羅斯福總統擬於明年參加第三决競選，但因內政不滿人望，故擬在外交政策方面挽回已墮的聲望云云。最近，前屆競選失敗的共和黨總統候選人蘭登且公開表示，彼並不反對中立法修正案，但應以羅氏聲明不參加第三决競選為條件，吾則羅氏希望利用修正中立法一事以消除政黨意見，實非公平云云。那簡直是坦白承認以中立法為政爭的工具，誠足使局外人齒冷！羞惡之心，人皆有之，美國公民大的必能淸澄這種氣象吧！</p>
<p>至於中立法所影響於遠東者，在日本未嘗不希望中立法可以修改，因為美國輸出軍火便宜了英法，同時却亦便宜及於擁有巨大海軍和商船隊的日本。但問題並不如此簡單，一因中日並沒有宣戰，根本與中立法無關；二因中國在實際向美國購買軍火，為數極少，不以此為抗戰的源泉；三因日本黃金垂竭，無力大量多購。何况美國方面早有對遠東另訂辦法的決心，只因為美日商的的阻礙，不能立即實行；現在美日商的旣將於明春失效·何時續訂權不在日本·日本即使能利用修改後的中立法·屈指算來，最多殆不過二三個月了。不但如此，這决美國國會特別會中，聽說還有對付日本的四宗提案，我們大可注意其下落！</p>
<h3>英法拒絕　莫索里尼和議　德報推重義大利斡旋　義報揚言中歐將波及</h3>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相、明日向下議院演說時、將答覆義大利首相墨索里尼調解歐戰建議、情報部批評墨索里尼星期六日所發演說時聲稱、「英國宗旨仍未變更、並當以不屈不撓決心實行之」、（二十五日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　義大利首相墨索里尼星期六日所謂歐洲在賞際上尚未開戰之言論、已引起法方半官性質之批評、以為英法業已表明態度、卽欲履行其保障波蘭之互助協定、同時倫敦人士歡迎墨索里尼所稱義國將繼續中立、並避免衝突擴大之聲明、至於義國準備應付一切事變一層、則認為各中立國所不得不採取之當然的防範計畫、惟墨索里尼所抱敵對行為現可停止之意見、則英方碍難贊同、蓋英國作戰目的、早經英首相張伯倫明白宣布、不能因波蘭之暫時瓦解、而遽改變方針云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　英法對於義首相墨索里尼終止歐戰呼籲之反響、法西斯黨方面頗為失望、墨索里尼喉舌蓋達在義大利民生報發表意聞、謂如不接受此種機會、則風潮將延及中歐云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　反映德國外交部見解之「德意志總彙報」於昨日著文評論墨索里尼演說、略謂、義國首相認識擔任世界强國義大利之領袖、及法西斯主義之保護者之責任、對於現行局勢及其後果、向全國人民與世界人士發表適當之言論、墨氏揭發民主國家對於波蘭之兩重政策、依照凡爾賽條的、恢復波蘭、實為幻想、因蘇聯參加波蘭戰爭、業已消滅恢複波蘭之可能性矣、該報以為墨索里尼將保持「觀望」態度、準備應付任何非常事變、該報結論謂、墨索里尼可以代表眞正和平陣綫、並代表希望戰爭地方化及限制戰爭時期之多數人民、發表言論云、（二十五日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　柏林政界人士對於英法兩國拒絕義相墨索里尼戰爭局部化之提議、認為意中事、惟對拒絕理由之欠充分則殊引為詫異、英法之理由、不外英法對德宣戰、因彼等對波有援助義務之故、然則蘇俄對波之地位與德國相同、奈何英法而不向俄立戰耶、柏林政界人士指陳墨索里尼首相於此時提出建議、當非偶然、要係鑒於第一期戰事已經告一段落、為幹漩和平之適常時機、今其提議旣遭拒絕、則義國態度當不能無所影響、至於德國無論抱最後勝利之信心、進入新階段之戰事、旣有波蘭大量鑛產農產之供給、又有德蘇兩國在軍事上經濟上政治上之合作、英法欲拒絕和議、自當周旋到底、柏林政界據稱、國際方面、英國原希望日本採取親英態度、但因德國外交幹旋、蘇日已簽訂停戰協定、而英國已感失望、此外、羅馬尼亞對英採取隔離態度、土耳其亦正努力與德蘇集團調整關係、國際局勢之未必於英法有利、於此可見一般、惟是德國對於英法、并無所求、因此在西綫并不開始攻擊、惟嚴陣以待而已、（二十五日海通電）</p>
<h3>德宣傳部長　駁斥謠言</h3>
<p>柏林　半官機關德意志通訊社頃發出消息稱、宜傳部長郭培爾、昨向各報發表談話、首謂日前業已發出聲明、比利時荷蘭盧森堡三國之中立、當加以尊重、茲願聲明其他各中立國、亦為德國所尊重、某國報紙會載稱、德國國社黨領袖六人、擁有巨資、業已秘密存放外國、絕非事實、此乃美國新聞記者轟格波克所捏造、其時聶格波克適在倫教、余以為此乃英國情報部所作謊言、當時盛傳國社黨各要人所有私產共有九十萬鎊之多、或則以五萬萬馬克為言、此說旋由美國各報予以刊登、英法兩國報紙、亦即欣然轉載、時至此際、即各中立國報紙、亦復競相刊戰、余為對抗此項謊言計、惟有反攻之一法、且因聶格波克自稱保有各種文件、足以證明吾人實有款項存放英美兩國各銀行、爰用無綫電廣播、要求渠在英美兩國報端、發表此種文件，余願在每筆款項內提成以酬之、聶格波克倘確有此種文件、祗須一舉手之勞、即可在二十四小時之內、博得五千萬馬克（二十四哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法外交當局　接見蘇聯大使　德蘇同狀異夢　認為尚可利用</h3>
<p>巴黎　外交决長特里勃頃於本日午前接見蘇聯大使蘇利資、會談甚久、政界人士從而加以評論云、英國外相哈里法克斯勛爵昨日亦會接見蘇聯大使邁斯基、於以見英法與蘇聯之間、俱能持續其外交常態、而彼此傾談、要在確知意向如何、加之此際適有土耳其國外交佈置薩拉茹格魯聘問蘇聯、綜合各方之動態、允覺值得注意、關於東歐事變以法國在外交上所採立塲而論、政界人士頃作如下界說、略謂義國首相墨索里尼日前發表演說時、嘗云英法兩國若確為波蘭國而戰、何以不向蘇聯宜戰、抑知英法兩國之對德宣戰、乃因九月一日接獲波國申請、爰即根據互助協定、予以援助、但波國在蘇聯軍隊入境之後、並未提出同樣請求、而以軍事觀點而論、西歐各國實亦無法直接攻擊蘇聯、故　宣戰、亦無補於波蘭、況乃以次促使蘇德兩國在政治上切實合作、此其不智、無待詞費、目德蘇協定未必持久、而此决戰事、則來日方長、職是之故、蘇聯此决對德雖處於同謀犯之地位、但該國旣已聲明賡續保守中立、則與其空言拒絕、不如正式接受之為愈、要之、此次戰事、乃長期的對鎖戰、、德蘇兩國目標互相抵觸之處、不一而足、今茲兩相結托、實僅暫時性質而已云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>兩次歐戰的比較觀　（續）</h3>
<p>— 陳楚祥</p>
<p>幾年來英國容忍希特勒的政策、也未始不是由此、她怕法國獨覇、防患於未然、所以拉德起來尅法、德蘇在簽訂不侵協定後同時表示、英國極希望德蘇敵對、多少也是建在認定英國這個作用的基點上、概括的說來、如果我們承認薩辣伊服事件是上决大戰的導火錢、德為履行對奧同盟、英為維持比利時中立而戰云云是藉口、那末、我們亦不得不承認但澤和走廊問題是這次大戰的導火綫、英法為履行對波諾言、德國為解除凡爾賽和的的束縛和波蘭的虐待日爾曼人云云是藉口、無論他們所宣傳的作戰目的是什麽、我們綜合的參看、還是說德國進行歐陸獨覇政策、英國不能容許、法國更不堪坐視、以致造成大戰、比較妥當些、這種論斷、似有認定德為戎首之嫌、可是我的回答、是歐陸獨覇政策應否推行、英國應吾阻止、都未便代為辯護、更無論作左右袒了、</p>
<p>上决大戰之前、曾經過四决危機、這回似乎沒有經過這麼多决數、比較兩决歐戰危機發生的地點、也很有味、上决歐戰的危機、除了第三决的巴爾幹半島危機在歐陸發生之外、其他三决、都不在歐陸、爭執點、都在地巾海的對岸、殖民地的菲州上面、木决只有意大利併吞阿比西尼亞是在歐陸之外、如果把牠列入危機的話、上决歐戰前的危機、都是很明顯的由兩主體利益直接衝突而起、如法意的突尼斯之爭、法德摩洛哥之爭、奧塞波黑Bosnia—Herzegovina二省之爭、本次所經過的各種危機的衝突主體就沒有如此單純、阿比西尼亞事件、英國掀動了全體國聯會員國去反對義大利、西班牙的內戰、如果也稱為危機之一、那更是公認的小型世界大戰、唯有去秋蘇台德事件、才比較相像、但德捷兩方聲勢相差頗大、仍不如上四决危機中兩對方的「旗鼓相當」、不過蘇台德爭端、仍不失為與上决奧寒之爭的最好比較、塞弱於奧、俄雖欲助之而憚於德、結果、勸塞讓步、奧亦因塞背後有俄、得波黑二省、遂暫時滿意、不然、以奧常時野心、或可不必等到其太子被刺即對塞有所行動了、（常然、德國的允許帮助與吾、更是重要因素、）所不同的是、蘇台德事變時、英法犧牲捷克以買歐洲的暫時和平、其後且無保障的決心、故捷克卒致淪亡這决波蘭問題、如果波蘭屈服或德國退讓、那也大有暫時化為危機而不致成為大戰導綫的可能、不過所謂波蘭屈服的意思、就是說波蘭要犧牲她對外貿易的出口和通路、如她背後沒有英法、也許是可以考慮的、背後有了英法、而英法又認為到了忍耐的最高限度、非堅持不可、那希特勒自然要說這次戰爭、是由英國給波以空白支票、鼓勵她强硬對德而起的了、德國若無德蘇不侵協定的興奮劑、也許可以暫時退讓一下、但道個假定仍有很多疑問、如果德蘇所締結眞是外間所傳的軍事同盟、德國靠他或可抵銷英法對波的互助力量、更可進而根本消滅英法助波的勇氣、現在德國所得到的、只不過是藉蘇聯力量共同催毀波蘭使她能全力應付英法那一點、蘇聯旣聲明對英法仍願維持中立、而德蘇間直接接觸後、能吾不發生磨擦又大堪疑問、母怪有人說、希特勒是「為人作嫁」、而期太林却坐享其成了、</p>
<p>然而、英法疊决表示遵守對波援助的諾言、而希特勒自已也設波蘭的强硬是由英國答應在各種情况下給以帮助所促成、如果他所說的眞是他腦子裹所想的、那他並不見得會完全錯覺的判斷以為英法不致參戰、或許他對於發動這决戰事自問勝利有可靠把握、但我們總不能不體諒到一個獨裁者自已說不出的弱點和苦痛、他對於國際條的的遵守保證、雖然可以隨時抹殺、而對國內說的一句話、總要算一句話、何况德國幾年來一向扯足順風旗、目前的挫折、豈不大違她的榮譽、而搖動民衆對政府的信仰呢、從這一個觀點、我們可以斷定這决大戰的發生、實有其必然性、德國想獨霸歐洲、而推行之、英法不能容忍、助波抗德、戰事剛起二三天內、一般論調、還以為德國在波貫澈目的後、將以旣成事實給英法看，請求和議、現在英法波三國相互議定不得單獨媾和、蘇聯雖巳出兵瓜分波蘭、英法却仍稱帮助波蘭要到其卞權完全恢復為止可見這决大戰從速結束的可能性、似乎很小了、迥顧本世紀初、奧國惟德國的「馬首是瞻」、故其發展可擬於德國本身的發展、另加以德國木身的野心、終與英國傳統政策不能相容而引起大戰、先後事跡、遙遙相對、歷史重演一語、雖仍有可議之處、說歷史的演變、實有相當一定的法則、亦並不大過分罷、一九一四年主角中的德·英·法·現在仍是主角、而且仍舊站在以前的相反壁壘、兩决對峙方向也相同、波蘭代替了以前俄國的位置、上决是奧德發動戰事、現在父是德國、不過實際行動的方向却兩樣、允其是俄國（蘇聯）的向背、最有重大的影響、上决德國參謀部最初即採取西攻政策、想用迅雷不及掩耳的手段先使法國屈膝、再回師東指、所以破壞比利時永久中立、先向西綫進攻、在東綫、則以帝俄內政腐敗、秘密動員已逾二週、且已宣告正式動員、而軍隊始終未曾集中、因為對俄無所畏、所以祇採守勢、以逸待勞、這决德國目的本在波蘭、所以東境採取上决西錢猛烈的攻勢、而西疆則倚齊格飛利綫為長城、着重於防禦、俄在上决是向東普魯士進攻、這决其替身波蘭、却反受德蘇的夾攻、法本來挨打、這决却採打人的姿勢、（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　港方塞出　外滙反動回鬆　沙遜出英金進美滙</h3>
<p>外滙昨日巿况、匯豐掛　牌、日滙放長半元、達二十六元半、荷蘭長二五、計十一元二五、餘如英美等各匯皆平、英美滙暗市、因市上各種流言、已消散無跡、致人心漸轉穩定、市勢遂略趨鬆、惟晨開因外行賣胃不健、曾稍帶軟、英金計四便士一五六二五、美匯為六元八七五、但不久華商紗花帮與港電等突來塞出、兼某行亦供意轉佳、是以情勢頓見回鬆、午後以香港再來電塞、雖西商沙遜稍來吸收美匯、但頭寸仍感寬裕、英金一度會喊過四便士二八一二五、美匯亦會鬆至七元〇九三七五、華商忽趁賤轉賣為買、沙遜亦吸收美金、故結果以英金　便士二五、美匯七元〇六二五收盤、較上週末、英鬆〇七八一二五、美硬一五六二五、九十月份期貨趨勢與現貨相若、中途西商沙遜突塞英扒美約套合匯兌價為三元九角七分六厘一、又美行大通進達出近、與華商套做美匯掉期、計貼出美金〇九三七五、的合月息為一分三厘半光景、</p>
<p>荷　滙日滙掛牌放長</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價均無電訊、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法均平、對滬降一二五、美對英跌二五、對滬縮五分、對法小二五、中央掛脾各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士一五六二五、美匯六元八七五、較上週六、英微緊〇一五六二五、美略軟〇三一二五、開後西商沙遜塞予外行現貨英金四便士一八七五、為狀平穩、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、日荷放長、餘均平定、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後沙遜突來復進某行現貨美匯六元九三七五、的套合匯兌價為三元九角七分六厘一、後華商紗花帮與港電相繼塞予大通有利等外行現貨英金四便士一八七五及二一八七五、並現貨美滙六元九三七五及七元〇六二五、時英金最硬亦喊過四便士二五、是以潛勢微鬆、將近午刻、稍有九十月份掉期買賣、計大通貼與華商套利者美金〇九三七五、約合月息一分三厘半光景、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價英金四便士二一八七五、美匯七元、比晨開英鬆〇六二五、美硬一二五、</p>
<p>美金現貨重出七元</p>
<p>後巿港電復來塞予外行現貨央金四便士二五並吐予沙遜外行華商等現貨美匯七元〇六二五及〇九三七五、時英金最硬會呌過四便士二八一二五、入後華商售予某行十月份美滙七元、過程仍略帶硬、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士二五、美匯七元〇六二五、本月份均與上價相同、十月份英金叫便士二〇三一二五、美匯六元九三七五、結果比上週末、現期英金均鬆〇七八一二五、美匯俱硬一五六二五、</p>
<p>香港英美匯價不動</p>

<p>天津二十五日、今日匯巿開盤平穩、英匯現貨緊〇三一二五、為三便士五三一二五、美滙不動、仍為五元八七五、申滙降一元半、為一百十七元半、「聯鈔」暗盤微賤七角五分、為八十六元七角半、</p>
<h3>金巿先漲後小　在四千一百元左右盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、始漲後疲、趨勢在四千一百元內外盤旋、蓋以上週間之種種虛浮謠言、本日始平息、惟結果終因外匯鬆動而稍下疲、初開受外滙略緊之鼓勵、高達四千一百二十元開盤、繼因銀樓帮等拋售、立回小至四千一百元、但不久港帮忽興買風、力購三百餘兩、兼證券帮亦來頻吸、市象頓形堅俏、會昂達四千一百六十八元高價、旋以外匯趨鬆、銀樓帮與金號等競相猛塞、目證券帮亦來復出、情勢遂告不支、頓瀉至四千〇八十元、午刻為狀稍穩、以四千一百十五元收盤、午後初時尚定、嗣因外匯繼續微鬆、散戶納胃頓淡、加之某金號代投機商傾向出籠、雖香港帮尚稍有進胃、但頭寸仍感供逾於求、一度撳竟小至四千〇六十四元低盤、入後散戶趁低拉提、遂回上至四千〇八十五元收盤、比上週末午收回跌二十元、全天交易尚旺、的一千五百餘兩、銀樓飾金亦起伏不定、終則無變化、海關金等仍平</p>
<p>烚赤小念元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開聞外匯略軟、情勢穩定、首由金號售予錢兌業十兩、為四千一百二十元、較之上週末午收做高十五元、開後因銀樓帮拋塞、一霎時回小二十元、銀樓帮吐予錢兌業三十兩、為四千一百元、此後某錢兌業納胃進步、（開代港帮吸收）加之售者轉少、立抬起四十元、某錢兌業進同業現金號各十兩、價四千一百四十元、時因外匯略轉鬆硬、故賣者稍旺、一度回挫至四千一百十五元、但不久港帮復興買風、兼證券帮亦跟踪吸購、市勢重趨向上、竟飛升五十三元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、為四千一百六十八元、旋以港帮等止進觀望、並因外滙續硬、證券帮亦反進為出、銀樓帮與某金號亦吐售頗力、市象遂不支下瀉、未幾竟暴落八十八元、現金號吐予錢兌業十兩、為四千零八十元、後同外匯轉定、銀樓帮與某金號賣風稍戢、故一般散戶遂乘低吸進、回起五十元、錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、為四千一百三十元、將近午刻、又向下挫、錢兌業互做三十兩、為四千一百十五元、作午收價、後市初開尚平、錢兌業進銀樓帮十兩、仍四千一百十五元、此後因外匯帶硬、某金號頻來塞出、同時銀樓帮亦仍有賣胃、立疲二十元、銀樓帮售予金號十兩、為四千零九十五元、時另一余號代港帮吸收、兼證券帮亦稍有納胃、遂回高十元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、為四千一百零五元、此後某金號賣風愈濃、力代投機商猛塞、加之進者寥寥、價竟傾跌四十一元、錢兌業互做十兩、為四千零六十四元、入後賣風稍戢、金號與錢兌業趁低吸收、遂稍回漲、金號進錢兌業十兩、為四千零八十五元作晚收價、結果比上週末午收回跌二十元聞收後塲內銀樓帮與錢兌業共互做三十兩、價均與晚收相同、後錢兌進銀樓帮十兩、價為四千零九十元、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、牧進比售出低五十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金軋平</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十五元、迨至九時四十分掛高五元、十時半回落五元、下午三時掛低五元、四時回上五元、結果無變化、計大同行與新同行均仍懸四百十五元、收進約减低二十元光景、</p>
<h3>英美鑫鎊　需殷獨漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、趨勢轉軟、緣滙市經港電一再拋塞後，市勢頗硬、致美金票雖於晨初微漲後、旋即回降至十四元三角半、結果下落三角、英金票亦跌六角、香港票小二分、安南票落三角半、羅比票降二角、朝鮮票小五釐、日金票趨勢尚堅、最後價仍為一元三角四分五釐、英美金鎊因需要頗殷、故一致續漲一元、此外均無變動、</p>
<h3>貼現步跌</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、突復下低、呈步降不回之勢、每千元初仍在九十元左右、後漸步低至午刻為八十五元、下午再傾低十元、最後七十五元、比上遇六復低十五元、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均開二角云、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債交易淸淡　廿五年四川善後　已在渝舉行抽籤</h3>
<p>公債暗盤交易、已不若前數日之興奮、大戶多頭尚在待時而動、昨日買賣、大戶極少進出、求售者不得其價、則亦廢然而返、而補進者則頗易得貨、交易皆屬於零星散戶、午後交易、先好後疲、反較上午為小、市價結果、略小一角至　角半、九六則反好一角、成交數的四十餘萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲五三·〇五五二·三〇　五二·七〇跌〇·三五</p>
<p>統乙四六·一五四五·七五　四五·八〇跌〇·三〇</p>
<p>統丙四五·七〇四五·一五　四五·五〇又〇·三〇</p>
<p>統丁四四·〇〇……　四四·〇〇又〇·一〇</p>
<p>統戊四四·八〇四四·三〇　四四·六〇又〇·一五</p>
<p>九六　五·七五　……　五·七五漲〇·一〇</p>
<p>股票交易成交紗布交易所股五十股、價為三十八元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報告云、昨日市况平靜、橡皮股允感淸淡、鋼業股甚活潑、波動價照前日最　時稍低、會德豐股需要良好、會被板至三十七元二角半、上海紗廠又告劇漲、一百五十元價、猶未饜足買方慾望、此外甚少可資評述、</p>
<p>廿五年四川善後公價、第七决抽籤、業於本月十五日在重慶舉行，計抽中第二〇號及第五一號二支、應還本金三十萬元、附同第七期到期息票、均定於本月三十日起、由重慶中央中國交通三銀行開始付軟云、</p>
<h3>紗花　同業囤藏　棉價看漲</h3>
<p>本棉白包花成交尚稱不弱、廠方申新等廠　略有納胃、但吃量未見膨脹、日商亦在觀望中、同業心思堅挺、因通州花目前來源雖依然踴躍而來、然浦江中已發生困難、一般人顧慮到以後之危險、因此某花號意嚮忽然轉舵、對於身骨優良之貨、開價為一百五十元、比上日漲起七元、獨喫幾千包、紛紛上棧囤藏看漲、品質稍遜之貨、及水分潮濕之棉價仍平、蘇北續到通花三千二百餘包、常陰沙八九百包、北沙一千五百包、茲將現棉售開之盤列左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、昨日無甚軒輊、然滬上存底不多、故棉價反形高昂、同業間售出心意殊為鬆懈、暫不願出售、目前市上三十二支以上原料甚為稀少、同業間略有現貨、但均不擬出售、廠方對於此類棉之需要、甚為殷切、竟苦難於購得、昨日市上可供紡二十支之美種新特、竟索價一百九十餘元、白洛區價一百七二元云、</p>
<p>外棉巿價、紐約棉巿、昨日較為平息、因出口商之未見活躍、市况殊形呆滯、後因一部份多頭了結、及同業閒略有拋賣、結果收盤價格較之上日跌去六七磅音、印度棉市連同預測跌六羅比、埃及利物浦停市、</p>
<h3>粗紗銷路已動</h3>
<p>紗巿依然堅定、但漲勢殊覺迂綏、實則有一部份心理因其底盤已屬高昂、對於籌碼一層、已見减縮、因此上身紗價漲力和緩、惟中等紗牌價格較廉、故冉冉上升、至於客帮港帮對於十支粗紗、銷路允暢、因其與二十支紗價距離太遠、且時令又在旺檔之際、所以市上成交大見增進、廠方獲利亦不及細紗之厚、較為微薄也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣尙緊、因原棉來滬、在浦江中發生困難、人心看好、開盤即漲十元、二十支雙馬棧單價為七百五十元、現貨價為八百元、中途稍有盤旋、但十支粗紗客帮納胃益健、市狀允昂、迨至收盤以後、氣勢稍帶平疲、查半日成交一千二百五十五包、行情二支雙馬漲十五元、天女漲十元、牧羊漲九元、十支粗紗漲五元至十元外、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港　六〇〇　同行　五六〇</p>
<p>內地　九五　統計一、二五五</p>
<h3>糖巿　糖價續緊一二元</h3>

<h3>糧食　米價一時難降</h3>
<p>杜粳　昨日各帮來源河下仍無到貨、而車輪包子崑嘉等區來新貨亦祇三四千包、故市面初開人心即佳、頗有喊高之意、及後本街店胃以隔昨星期停市，都有出手動辦、乃形勢頓緊、各貨價一路昂升、若粳尖悉提高一元左右、及至晚市、本街採辦忽見轉懈、且秋節日近、故一動之後、即呈疲態、結果各新貨及新尖行情遂回小四五角、計特常粳三十九元、中市貨三十五元、特鍚粳三十八元、高貨三十六元、中决三十四元、蘇同崑粳三十三四元、崑顓周浦等新粳二十六七元、河下早晚稻以無貨乏市、至蘇崑嘉湖等新羊尖、開二十六元至二十五元半、盧尖二十五元半至二十五元、江北尖二十四元八角至二十四元、蕪湖尖高二十五元二角、市二十四元半决二十三五角至二十二元五角、變元三十二三元、成交數統市計去六千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　邇日江北來貨、時被某方攔阻、內地車運亦遭阻難、而進戶以週假與秋節休市關係、莫不儘量收買、故晨市各秈一度漲起元外、旋以日商有整票售出、分上中下三等、價開二十二元·二十三元·二十四元、而進戶亦以價高觀望、故後市又見回落半元許、結果祇較大五六角、高客秈二十五元二三角至二十四元八角、中决二十四半至二十三元不等云、</p>
<h3>走勢稍活　粉價又高</h3>
<p>回籠貨開七元一角六七分</p>
<p>麵粉　日昨復見昂挺、天津及秦皇島等處、對於二號粉需要漸食、南洋帮各路進胃亦稱聯蟬、兼值中秋節令、月餅汛本街零批交易頻繁、統市本客成交併計約有五六萬包、二號粉廠盤未動、仍為七元現鈔、回籠貨則已提高至七元一角五六分、較上週末回升一角以上矣、麵粉今日有五萬零五百包、運到天津、又五百包、運塘沽、又一萬三千包、運香港、</p>
<p>小麥　來源尚不湧旺、兩天中到貨的有二萬餘包、執貨者多以成本高昂、均思警價而沽、惟廠胃囤戶辦興不濃、市面卒難過好、統市由福新廠辦去管店蘇州太倉等麥共四千餘包、及囤戶拉進四五車、最高價為十元零二角、市面比前提升數分至近角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　漂染布疋　上漲更銳</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨布價以　各廠開盤均昂、巿勢殊堅、白貨細斜·粗布以現銷仍佳、手貨每疋又昂一角至二角半、細布粗斜平平、漂染布疋以坯布及染煉費雙重增加、漲勢更銳、每疋提漲五角左右、本客帮現銷均有發展、本街採辦細斜、色丁，嗶嘰·坯布及漂染印花布三百餘件、細斜·細布·粗布四百餘件、粵帮辦粗布一百餘件色布·色斜·綫呢一百餘箱、商邱·蚌埠·泰州等地辦色布·色斜·嗶嘰·綫呢·印花·色丁等貨四千餘疋、國外香港·星加坡諸地續　辦漂染布印花二千餘疋、細斜四五十包、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>市氣續堅、色貨四君子嗶嘰昨現盤售開每　瑪六角八分二五、白貨龍頭細布由廿二元五角、提升至廿二元七角半、較上週每疋繼續漲二角半、本街及客帮心思交易依然熱鬧、成交七八百件、東棉洋行訂開下月份龍頭細布一百件、每疋價為二十三元五角、</p>
<p>出口</p>

<p>本市絲業、白廠經外銷冷落、然絲市尚無疲軟現象、輯里經六個號子麒麟跑馬等級、售開一九三〇元、做開九十擔、堪稱堅穩、印銷咋僅發電、並無成交、</p>
<h3>珠茶洋莊動辦</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶交易、惟蝦目珠茶、頗有走銷、全市由同孚錦隆等行買進一百八十餘箱、市盤做開二百十六元至二百四十元、此外貢熙綠茶、白頭行家亦有零星進胃、市盤正在談判中、</p>

<h3>靑春的必要知識　健康能助長愛的滋長</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>健康家庭的寶　是什麽？這祇消能緊記「靈肉一致」的口號。家庭之所以樹立，是需「靈」或「肉」來維持的。食色性也，可見夫婦關係，並非單純意義的「靈」所能概括。事實明告吾人，縱慾可以傷身，所以純肉主義，也決難維持夫婦關係於永遠，總之偏重一方，是最錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>靈肉一致，實是家建幸福的關鍵，吾人當絕對信任，然則怎樣去平均分配，怎樣才是合理的行使？自應介紹讀者一個簡單的概念。生殖不滿足，往往構成「反目」的原因，說不定更須引誘一方於不道德的途徑。所以我們必須要使生殖的機能健全。一方面不可縱然自戕，則腎虧可免，那末，至少可得一有力的保障，不使感情破裂，在日常相處，雙方都有輔助情感發展的義務。總之，「靈」與「肉」兩者，應當平均分配，而分離行使，應當在「正當」，和「節制「的兩大原則上着手。</p>
<p>夫婦情感濃厚，家庭的空氣也變為和樂融洽的溫度了，可是身體不加培養，則愛情不能滋長，是故健康能助長愛苗的滋長，此則深望讀者注意及之。</p>
<p>縱慾足以傷身，故過度交合，允其是男子，足以構成脊髓症狀，和下肢萎弱，精神衰退，遺精和滑精，甚至發育不全，靑年正像有生氣的草，設或罹致上述病症，不是把靑年的寶貴前途喪失殆盡嗎？</p>
<p>為愛情前途計，此種疾病必須速治，德國舉丸精質製劑男用「補體康」為近代內分泌劑之冠，日服三决，確具補腦，補血，補精之功能，凡神經衰弱，面色蒼白，腎虧不育，未老先衰，最為對症，余在臨床上使用七年，從未遇失效病例，故敢介紹於病家，其女用「補體康」為卵巢內分泌製劑，具有調經種子之功。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>白濁絕對可獲根治</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋病一症，豈眞不能用科學的方法可以根治乎？實則不然，淋病是可用科學方法去征服的。不過治療方是吾徹底而合科學，此則全視醫家之經騐如能攝生而聽信醫家之指示，如此則淋病息者必能在治療時，不可不深謀而熟慮之。始可免於失敗之一途也。惟是余恆見一般淋病患者，急於求愈，以其病之不能一時獲效，乃不免頻露焦窘之念，而市上一般成藥與醫生，乃投其所好，謂用某某藥，某某療法，可以在三二天內完全根治，而結果則三四月尚不能脫離淋病痛苦，而且愈陷於淋病症象紛亂之境。不堪收拾，故非使用對症療法，將淋菌完全加以扑滅不可；因為祇有使淋病完全根本肅淸才免有不良之預後。</p>
<p>在各國醫家對每年新藥分析試騐之結果，共足以稱特效藥者，惟德國彼德博士發明之「克淋儂」一藥，足以冠於全球任何淋病內服藥，因其殺菌力洋溢全身細胞，故不論逃竄何處之淋菌，總不能逃出「克淋儂」之殺菌圈。舉凡淋毒性之攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，腎盂炎，舉丸炎，關節炎，尿道狹窄等，服用「克淋儂」絕對可以根治，因其殺菌力之範圍並不在表面與局部，而是直接扑減在病灶上之淋菌也。至於外用方面，男子可外用「抗淋水」，女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，如此內外分途殲滅，治愈尤速。</p>
<h3>咳嗽症的嚴重</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽之症，最易使人輕忽，原因是咳嗽息者，以其一時並無若何危篤之現象可怕，所以一直就延宕下來，而咳嗽也就愈演愈凶，馴致不可挽救。</p>
<p>從眞正的病理上而言，咳嗽乃肺部排除外界侵入不良份子，正是一種抵抗禦侮的表示，若是用麻醉劑反而减低抵抗力，以余二十餘年之經驗，並參考各國醫家實騐報錄，惟德國徒梅博士所發明之肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」一藥功效最著，不論如何頑固難愈，或將成癆之咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」後能於三小時內，收鎮咳化痰之功，補肺防癆，其功遠居魚肝油之上，此為各國醫家所證明者德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>保健須知</p>
<h3>男女凟受害　方面的深淺觀</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>無人不知男子的自凟，能使脊髓神經與腦神經發生病態，故久犯之後，神經衰弱，腰痠背痛，並有遺精等症，其害無窮。然而在女性方面，亦有種種的害處，不過與男性較之，則有不及。今據專家的調查，女子之犯自凟者，亦不若男性的普遍，犯此者，其生理上所受之害，遠不及其精神上為大。蓋女子一犯自凟，其貞靜之美點，完全喪失無遺，故自凟的女子，易以墮落，大都均屬未來娼妓與蕩婦的候補者，但久犯之後，能使性器發炎，月經失調，不感症等，在衛生上講，自凟有百害而無一利，男性靑年允應戒絕，如感身體虧損，隨時服以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，則因自凟而起的種種斵傷，可恢復原狀，同時兼以「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精，而在女性方面，可服女用「補體康」以補救之。</p>
<p>淋病談藪</p>
<h3>淋毒性膀胱炎之特治</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述　診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋毒性膀胱炎，為淋病患者於急性淋時或慢性淋時，被一種不良之拙劣手術，行局部洗滌法，或於慢性淋時，忍尿行房，凡此皆能使淋菌逆竄內部膀胱，患者少腹作痛，尿意頻數，尿液溷濁，甚至尿中混有血液。如此日復一日，病棄甚熾，如不及早治療，結果必致淋毒的原菌，更進一步，上竄腎臟，而成淋毒性腎孟炎，如此病勢史見嚴重。挽救益不可不迅速，因為淋毒之勢蔓延日甚，不免有變症蜂起之可應也。惟關於此等療法，不能不審愼從事。如其再用一般局部療法，或透膜殺菌療法，更不濟事，不免有一誤再誤之嫌。亟宜愼之。</p>
<p>要之，淋毒性膀胱炎一症，治療愈速愈佳。余對於淋毒性膀胱炎之治療，先用科學方法，檢查病灶所在，診斷其病灶所在地後，再用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，及用德國靜電療法，X線電療法等交相為用，如此急性淋時之膀胱炎，可在二星期中治愈，如其已成慢性膀胱炎，則三四星期，亦絕對可以治愈。余於淋病之治療，已有二十年之經騐，或投以內服藥，或應用手術，或用電療，均能隨症而治，無不得心應手，迅速取效。淋毒膀胱炎經過上述治法後，短期內其症狀即能迅速减輕以至根治，絕無失敗之例　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角，並送價值一元之「性病全書」一冊</p>

<h3>偽警行動猖獗　美水兵突遭拘禁　被覊押二小時始得釋放　美禁官兵前往界外馬路　對此案不願與偽方交涉</h3>
<p>偽警侵入滬西越界築路後、橫行不法、一再滋事、前日曹家渡發生公共汽車司機一名被暴徒綁架、而同晚復有美海軍陸戰隊水兵一名、被偽警拘留二小時、工部局警務處遂訓令該地捕房、在越界築路各重要地帶、採取更嚴密之戒備、致滬西情形、又趨緊張、茲記詳情如後、</p>
<p>起因細微　竟被拘禁</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊士兵一名、昨（二十四日）夜九時在滬西區被「大道」警察扣留幾兩小時、至十時五十五分始經釋出、此事之發生始於兆豐附近之惠爾康咖啡店前、截至昨日深夜、猶未確悉詳情、惟知該美兵與人口角、咖啡館所僱司閣乃鳴警笛、「大道」警察的二十人、聞聲前往、繼與美兵起掙扎、美兵孤不敵衆、遂被押上卡車一輛、駛往極司非爾路「大道」警局、</p>
<p>兩小時後　始得釋出</p>
<p>公共租界警務處與美陸戰隊第四聯隊當局、立即接得通知、開始磋商釋放該兵、商談幾吶小時、美兵始得釋出、美海軍與陸戰隊當局恐續有此種事件發生、乃立即禁止陸戰隊士兵與水兵往愚園路區、並派巡邏遍巡該區、令水兵與陸戰隊士兵悉數離去、致午前一時以後兆豐公園附近愚園路一帶之酒肆酒吧間、與蘋菓遊戲店、顧客寥寥無幾、</p>
<p>美方令禁　官兵往游</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美陸戰隊士兵一名、昨夜在愚園路被「大道」警察所扣、今（二十五日）晨據美海軍某高級軍官語記者稱、現已禁止美第四陸戰隊官兵前往滬西整個界外馬路區云、此令係第四陸戰隊司令官費根上校今日所發、繼續有效、至續發通告為止、</p>
<p>不願從事　調查談判</p>
<p>關於該意外事件、今晨據第四陸戰隊執行官茂萊中校聲稱、對於牽涉此事中之陸戰隊士兵一名、刻正採取「例行舉動」、美陸戰隊方面對於此事、絕不擬與他方面進行調查或談判云、意外事件發生後、即有美軍巡邏隊到達愚園路區、而令美兵包括美亞洲艦隊水兵在內、均離該區、實行此令時、秩序井然、而不妨碍該區各酒肆等之平民顧客、</p>
<p>派隊查阻　再入該區</p>
<p>俄續有美陸戰隊巡邏隊駐守愚園路與極司非爾路轉角百樂門舞廳旁、攔阻駛往愚國路之一切汽車、旨在阻止第四陸戰隊士兵入該區、意外事件發生後半小時內、愚園路上每隔不足四百碼、即有「大道」警察三四名、結隊巡行、</p>
<p>警務處已　加緊戒備</p>
<p>公共租界警務處今晨在愚園路及其他界外馬路一帶戒備益緊、據駕汽車循界外馬路而行者聲稱、公共租界巡捕雖任汽車駛過、不加阻礙、但駐守於租界巡捕不數碼處之「大道」警察、輙令汽車停止、對車廂注視一過後、始准繼續前駛、聞警務處今在界外馬路區進行職務、已得特殊訓令、惟工部局當局今晨不願披露目前是吾正在該區採取任何新步驟、</p>
<p>越界築路　治安堪虞</p>
<p>曹家渡一帶、日來表面尚稱平靜、惟前日下午四時、發生公共汽車司機在該處被綁架案、當時巡捕偽警、均曾目擊、但多不加干涉、治安堪虞、咋日在（一）極司非而路康腦脫路、（二）康腦脫路星加坡路、（三）極司非爾路白利南路支路等三處崗位、全由偽警指揮交通、巡捕則退守人行道上守望而已、餘如（一）極司非爾路勞勃生路、（二）白利南路支路口兩處崗位、仍有偽警與巡捕站崗、保持原有雙崗狀態、</p>
<p>昨日下午　形勢和緩</p>
<p>在極司非爾路上愛文義路及海格路口、速日捕房本派有大批中西探捕分別在該處戒備、檢查行人車輛、昨日下午、僅華捕四名、在行人道上往來形勢大見和緩、至秋園前及開納路口之交通、全係偽警管理、惟秋園前佈崗偽警較多、共有八名、康家橋至馬路橋一帶、情形仍如往日、未見變動、愚園路及靜安寺路之地豐路口、均有偽警六各、分別駐守、於每一轉角之行人道上、交通亦由偽警管理、原駐之巡捕、已由八名减至四名、情形不如日前之緊張、大西路美麗園弄口駐守之偽警二名、仍未撤退、哥倫比亞路及安和寺路等處、裝載偽警之卡車、昨日起往來决數、大為减少</p>
<p>捕房戒備　甚為周密</p>
<p>海格路億定盤路口、自十七日偽警在該處佈崗後、形勢較他處緊張、捕房方面、戒備甚為周密、惟昨日駐防該處之探捕僅有六名、且裝甲車亦已移往他處、至四四八號林氏巨厦前、日偽所築之堡壘、尚在修建中、防守之偽警、原有十餘名、昨日已减至六名、自地豐路至法華鎮一段、仍時有武裝偽警列隊巡行、</p>
<h3>電力公司加價　日僑反對　已向工部局呼籲</h3>
<p>字林報云、據昨日（二十四日）日文上海每日新聞載稱、上海，日僑馬路聯合會卞人執行委員會、於星期六日夜間集會、一致反對上海電力公司提議中加費百分之一百二十、惟該委員會近已向工部局呼籲、抗議局方核准電力公司繼續加費事、今將於接得工部局之答覆後、始取具體行動、</p>
<h3>各業向公會建議籌設評價委會　但事實上恐有困難之處　惟望當局取締囤積操縱</h3>
<p>經濟部前為取締投資操縱、穩定各地日用必需品價格、通令各地主管官署會同當地有關商會、及經營日用必需品之同業公會、設立平價委員會、辦理當地日用必需品平價事宜、今非淪陷區域各省市及各縣、均已先後奉令設立、於是各地物價已趨穩定、絕無投機操縱情事發生、至於上海方面、因環境惡劣、情形特殊、各投機者因政府權力所不及、囤積居奇、以致物價飛漲、</p>
<p>資產階級　大事囤積</p>
<p>自歐戰爆發後、一般擁資者、從事囤積貨物、允以日用必需品之糧食燃料油糖等、價格之飛漲、為歷來所罕見、價格又不劃一、甚為畸形、市民生計、則大受影響、正當商人交易困難、聞各業會向同業公會建議、</p>
<p>建議遵照　政府規定</p>
<p>請求市商會會同租界當局、籌設上海物價評定委員會、以日用需要貨物為限、其方法仿照政府頒佈之非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法辦理、但聞設立評價委會、經各業公會考慮後、</p>
<p>上海方面　事實困難</p>
<p>認為上海方面、事實上恐有困難之處、惟希望租界當局對投機囤積操縱市上日用必需物品者、應予查究、以維治安、而免影響市民生計、</p>
<h3>九底到期各債　本息準期付款　金長改由四行貼現　惟電政公債暫停付</h3>
<p>財政部維持債信始終如一、對內債照常抽籤還本付息、凡屆本息到期之前、由指定担保品項下撥出、交經付本息之銀行付款、從未愆期、已深得持券人信仰、昨向銀行界探悉、九月三十日到期應付本息之公債、（一）民國十七年金融長期公債、發行於十七年十一月、定額四千五百萬元、此次係第十二次還本一百十二萬五千元、因係以關餘為担保品、自政府被迫停付本息後、由國債基金管理委員會、商得中中交農四行同意、改由四行貼現付款、上海方面、則分六期付給匯工、（二）整理廣東金融公債、發行於民國二十五年十月、定額一萬二千萬元、此决係第六决還本二百四十萬元、（三）闢濬廣東省港河工程美金公債、發行於民國二十六年四月、定額美金二百萬元、此决係第五决還本美金四萬兀、以上兩種公債、到期本息、准由中央銀行等經付機關如期付款，（三）民國二十四年電政公債、發行於民國二十四年十月、定額一千萬元、此决係第十六次還本四十萬元、其主管官署為交通部、其担保品為國際報費收入、今因國際報費收入被刦奪、萬不得已暫行停付本息、</p>
<h3>蘇州河北甲區　日方竪立界牌　用中英文標明警備界綫　甲區以內豎立四處之多　連日又强迫居民注射防疫針</h3>
<p>蘇州河北甲區、計自北江西路至北河南路區域、英日防綫變更後、日軍已在北河南路之東邊豎立境界綫、强迫防疫注射工作、亦仍繼續、茲分述各情如次、</p>
<p>北河南路　豎境界牌</p>
<p>日軍自接防北江西路至北河南路間之區域後，除在北江西路海甯路西口放有日兵崗哨外、別無異動、比至昨日午後一時、北河南格口突駛有日方軍用車一輛、載來日兵十餘人、分別在該路東邊各路口豎立白底紅字、漆有中英文「日英警備地區境界綫」字樣之路牌、</p>
<p>四處路口　設置竣事</p>
<p>上項境界脾之豎立地點、據昨日傍晚調查、計（一）北蘇州路天后宮橋北境、（二）天潼路三民醫院門前、（三）七浦路張順新醬圍側面、（三）文監師路口小菜塲南端四處、至海甯路及老靶子路口、則尚未有豎立、</p>
<p>昨日繼續　强迫注射</p>
<p>日軍在海甯路北江西路西口上海電話公司側面搭蓋之帆布篷帳下、咋日繼續强迫當地居民注射防疫針、填發防疫證明書、是項注射日期、已限於本月底截止、過期如未領有防疫證明書、即喪失在該區域內之居住資格、</p>
<p>注射期限　月終截止</p>
<p>常地居民因受上項脅迫、篷帳遂擠滿待注射之羣衆，秩序易於凌亂、前日起、即由日方派有日兵兩名彈壓、昨日叉增加『大道警察』兩名、日兵中之一名、並執有籐鞭一支、隨時揮動、驅趕在附近竚觀之閑人、</p>
<p>北河南路　防務無變</p>
<p>北江西路靶子路口以前英兵駐紮處、及該路西端之鐵路醫院、尚無日軍進據、北河南路盡頭鐵門口、除仍由英軍站崗外、右側碉堡內亦仍有英軍駐防、北河南路海甯路口錢江會館門前、佈有鐵絲網架、英軍一名、駐守其間、至於北江西路與北河南路間各馬路情態、一切如常、</p>

<p>現在給養　為七萬元</p>
<p>又查現有難民人數因俱陷山窮水盡之境、實已無可核减、每月給養費、以米價上落不定、故不能確定、現大的為七萬元、饒神父無間風雨、每日必至處辦公、並不時視察各收容所、為人道服務精神、深堪矜式、</p>

<h3>火花般的生活</h3>
<p>— 過果</p>
<p>火花——光明的，灼熱的。而靑年的生活就應該像那火花。</p>
<p>靑年的生活應該蓬蓬勃勃地，過得有光有熱；但僅是這樣，仍嫌不够。應該把那從自己的生活中發射出來的燦爛的「光」，去焚毀社會的黑暗面，使無數墮在黑獄中的人們，得藉着你底「光」而爬出了黑獄；而在你的生活中所發出的巨量的「熱」，應該用來溫暖那些感到寒冷的人們，使他們也產生同樣巨大的熱量來，作為邁進的動力。</p>
<p>火花的產生，是由於兩種「力」的激撞。人類之有生活的意念，是與生俱來，接着，產生出某種不正當的慾望。如果人類不去制裁那些不正當的慾望，使牠消滅，反之居然要滿足牠，那末不但人與人之間的糾紛，因此增加；世間的正義，也將因此毀滅無遺；世界進化必將停頓，甚至會超過了原始時代以上的野蠻。人們有從善的本能：使正當的充份發展，而那些不正當的必予以制裁，毀壞。激發慾念的力能或者在所不免，富於的束慾念的力能則更優秀，兩種「力」的相遇，激撞，在生活中便吐射出光明，灼熱的火花。這「熱」，推動他們前進，這「光」燭照着他們去抓取偉大的目的物。要是給這種人以一個名詞，那麽便是「英維」。而靑年便應該有着「英雄」般的生活，——這裹，我們必須認識，這為自己，也為大衆，個人的「英雄」是不存在的。我們平均地把這兩種「力」發揚光大，使這兩種「力」作着猛烈的搏鬬，使自己的生活有光有熱，像那火花一樣。</p>
<p>所謂火花般的生活，並不是神秘的，這正如火花的本身並不是神秘的東西一樣。原始人類見火生滅無定，一會見它燎起了燭天的火苗，一會見這火苗又跑得踪影全無，覺得這眞是一個不可捉摸的神秘的東西。而由於科學家努力的探索，才知道「火」不過是燃燒時的現象，而燃燒又有賴於氣體（如氧等）的支持。火苗的生滅無定，與氧素含量的多寡，有着莫大的關係。在古代，人類被「火所統御；而現代，却是人類支配着「火」。對於生活，我們亦應該卸下神秘的外衣，「神」，「鬼」，「命運」的力量絕不能動搖，左右我們的生活。要煽旺我們生活的光燄，就先得增加我們生活中的「氣素」的含量。一個人的生活的光燄的所以黯淡，就是由於生活中的「氧素」的含量太稀薄的原故。我不敢說這話就是眞理，然而生活的「苦」與「樂」，「充實」與「空虛」的界碑便在這裹。</p>
<p>火花——光明的，灼熱的，而靑年的生活便應該像那火花。</p>
<h3>江之戀</h3>
<p>— 唐韋</p>
<p>——刧灰拾記——</p>
<p>為了某種緣故，我决定與老冲同居了。</p>
<p>我們的住所，在市街的盡頭，一所靠近江邊的板房；這里很像「聊齋」裹的神仙窟。秋蒿抱定三面板壁，不知名的蟲子，鎮日鎮夜的　咻，不容你有片刻靜思的時間；——所幸，已經躲開了白俄浮浪漢和蕩婦們。酒後的酣歌，總使偶然聽到，因為過於渺遠，反覺得曚朧有趣。</p>
<p>憑窗的江水，彷彿一面躺仰着的鏡子，燈光在水面上渲染着無數斑爛的金點。</p>
<p>我迷戀着它。</p>
<p>那重疊的細波，鶴膀一般的帆影，揶揄了我幾個火一樣的羊頭；幾决我離開它，———不久又在它浮動的沙堤上出現了。</p>
<p>如今，松花江也好像改換了外觀；它那龐大的身影，彷彿是剛被蹂躪過的一個處女，疲倦，痛楚地躺着。</p>
<p>我不忍再多看它一眼，又不曉得是什麽力量在暗中挑逗着我！不能够安睡。</p>
<p>深夜了。</p>
<p>我從新踱上浮動的沙堤。沒有微屑的聲音，我平低了呼吸。用手輕輕地捧起着江水，在嘴上一吻——這溫情的撫慰，使江水更加重沉痛的咽泣了。</p>
<p>隔岸狺狺的犬吠，翠鬱的村莊，在黑影中親切地誘惑我！</p>
<p>我守望着這活在殘酷命運中的一切，直到秋霧搭濕了頭髮。</p>
<p>回來已經曙灰了。</p>
<p>老冲告訴我，深夜裹這一帶江面，常作埠頭憲兵隊秘密的刑塲，我才知道剛剛冒了一段胡塗的大險。</p>
<h3>枕戈待旦的荷蘭</h3>
<p>— Philip　Debock著　王白石節譯</p>
<p>今日的荷蘭，仍如以前一樣强盛。義務兵役更形擴展。每個年在十九——五十五歲的男子，都有服兵役的義務。普通每個十九歲的靑年，都須受過八個月的軍事訓練。其中受過較高教育的則受訓的時期更長，而且都受命為待備役軍官（N．C．Os）。自十九歲至二十八歲得在野戰軍團中服役，過此年齡，就加入國防部隊。因此荷國雖然只有九百萬人口，卻有近八十萬的兵員。這些軍隊都受過完全的訓練，配備整齊的武裝，能於二十四小時之內動員起來；有的（如防守國境綫或海岸綫的兵員）可能在六小時之內集中。</p>
<p>荷軍的主要成分是野戰軍——是最精銳的部隊；他們隨時隨刻準備打擊兇橫的侵略者。</p>
<p>荷蘭的邊境沒有像馬其諾，茜格菲等一樣的强固的防綫，再者，國境綫也太長，如要建築這類的防綫，對於雖稱富庶的荷蘭，也嫌太費金錢。但是不能說荷蘭是亳無防綫的。在與德比二國接壤的邊境，亳不偏移地散列着許多崗位和其他防禦工事，使一般中立國的觀察者驚奇不置。</p>
<p>荷軍並非用以侵略他國其目的在抗禦侵略。牠的防禦陣綫是依天然地勢建立的。以目前來說，其最大假想敵是德軍。東部第一條天然防綫是沿南北流的Ysel和Meuse河，須德海（Zuyder　Sea）和馬斯特立支（Maestricht）之西有高山峻嶺，形成一條非凡堅强的天然防綫。卽在承平時期，也堅固地守衛着。沿綫羅列着許多崗亭，暗截臺，更有無數鞏固的塹壕等防禦工事。河上的橋標，在太平時就埋伏了地雷，因此到了緊急時，海牙的政府只需一聲號令，立刻就能把牠們全體炸成粉碎。</p>
<p>第二條防綫在因姆河（Eem）流域。這是一條自瓦仁甯仁（Wageningen），在萊茵河畔）北，沿阿馬斯福特（Amersfoort）流入須德河的小河。全河流經過一塊的十哩闊的平原。這塊平原之東西有大山環抱着。如引萊茵河水或須德海水入此平原，則在一二小時之內，立刻成為一片有一二尺深的汪洋大海。</p>
<p>讀者們恐不能想像出這條汜濫防綫會有多大効果。上次歐戰時狄克斯美德（Dixmuyde）附近的汜濫，可說是近乎這種戰略：然而那决還僅僅是當作權宜的計策。荷蘭現在是在平時就詳為計劃好的，其効力當然更大。荷蘭正確地知道水源的來處，建立了許多水閘，有人（大部分是後備役的軍人）住在水閘附近，以便隨時聽令開啟閘鬥。荷蘭又完全熟知水流的方向，汜濫範圍的大小，以及各處的水深。在和平時，他們已製就特種地圖，來標明這一切。</p>
<p>一九一四年西綫偶然的汜漲會經救了英法比三國的軍隊，以免敗北。因此荷蘭這種準備有素的水淹戰略，至少能予敵人一個打擊，同時予本國軍隊保衛祖國的工作一個大大的助益，這是亳無疑意的。他們那時將使地面完全淹沒，水量又不多不少，以致行舟則嫌淺，但又深得能使荷蘭牧塲上相交相切的千百小運河，和陸地分辨不出來，予敵軍以莫大的阻礙。敵軍的重　坦克完全失効，而且須在泥沼中跋涉。</p>
<p>荷國軍事當局確相許多泛濫防綫不致被敵人衝破。不過在防綫後方的人民，或要遭受可怖的天空轟炸，以致放棄防守也不說定。</p>
<p>因此，空防就成為荷蘭的重大的問題。荷國空軍包含三個聯隊，所有的飛機和戰門員都是非常優秀的。荷蘭民用航空在世界上素有聲譽。</p>
<p>防空的高射　有一聯隊，器械都是最新式的。</p>
<p>至於海上的防禦，荷蘭大半依賴潛水艇，摩托魚雷艇，以及其他種種小型艦艇。大型軍艦大半用於荷屬東印度。這種由著名的荷蘭水手駕駛的小型艦艇，在淺海中橫衝直撞的小型艦艇，正是侵略者不易應付的尖兵哩！</p>
<p>德國是否敢破壞荷蘭的中立，是吾敢悍然予以攻擊，誰知道呢？</p>
<h3>心曲</h3>
<p>— 文犀</p>
<p>但願來一陣狂風怒號，起一陣波濤高吟，將終日絮在心頭的悲念驅走。</p>
<p>我看不到靑春的微笑，也不見年少者熱情的澎湃，一切都有着陰影的跟隨。</p>
<p>我全身都感到空乏，好似在飢餓着，對於這世界，漸起了厭態。</p>
<p>以前的生涯是在冥冥中，但有時也充滿了怏樂，和今之時日相此，僅得到「不堪回憶」，於是，人們將生命築在「未來」上，這一朶未放的花蕾，是安放在熱忱的心中，用全身精力栽培。</p>
<p>目前的苦楚祗有忍受，黯淡的光芒不足為悲，即是在黑暗中，也湮沒不了我的心志。</p>
<p>但願一杯苦酒，咽入喉管，滴落最後的淚，就與痛苦告別。</p>
<p>但願我能每日唱幾首短歌，訴說我的願望，使我有着純潔的心，不入汚流。</p>

<p>世間有些理論，彷彿永遠只不過是理論，主張這些理論的人一着實際的時候，他們的工作却又轉换方向了。戲劇離不開大衆，這說法當然是準確的。戲劇是宣傳，是敎育，即使是藝術至上主義者，也不能否認。近數年來的前進劇人所努力的方向便在這一面。不僅戲劇如是，戲劇不過是整個「文化人走向大衆去」的巨浪中的一波。但在孤島上看來，會幾何時，這熱烈的信仰到那裏去了？從事於戲劇運動的人選很多，先後成立的劇團也不少，然而他們的工作的對象，並不是如何去獲取大量觀衆的理想的戲劇，因此造成了話劇沒有大衆擁護的局面。固然也可以說這是他們能力薄弱所致，但他們的致命傷還不在此，他們心目中藐視了天天滿座的「公活佛」的觀衆，「火燒紅蓮寺」的觀衆，天韻樓大世界的文明戲塲的貌衆，甚至也藐視了綠寶劇塲的觀衆。</p>
<p>「濟公活佛」之類和文明戲塲的觀衆，自有其歷史的根據，姑且不諭。綠寶劇塲在上海不過一二年歷史，如今在游藝界中，卻也佔有一個優越的地位，這不是偶然的。綠寶劇塲除一二所謂電影明星者作爲號召外，其餘的仍不過是文明戲班裏的老角色。然而他們演出的姿態却是「話劇的」，而不是「文明戲的」。若要道道地地一推究，那麼，他們是確竇已經採取了文明戲之長，而放進在話劇的形式中來了。因此，同樣一個劇本，在綠寶劇塲公演時，其效果之成功必遠勝於當今以話劇號留之諸劇塲。反過來，祿寶劇塲縱無良好劇本，也還一樣可以靠了演員們的「特長」而維持下去。</p>
<p>因此，職業性的話劇塲彼開此閉，總難立脚似的。他們在營業上雖一再失敗，但還能夠自己安慰自已地想：「道是上海的觀衆太幼稚一。這想法固然也有理由。以脹前的「　宮」「辣斐」等爲例，它們的主持人總不失爲研究戲劇有經騐的人，可是當他們上演一個生琉的劇本時，就毫無成功的把握了。他們對於觀衆不能建立一個堅强的信仰，一個生疏的劇本上演之後，使觀衆搖頭而去，而老實說來，不滿意的劇本比滿意的劇本更多！之後，他們所擁有的觀衆僅有了一部分話劇的醉心者，一般大衆對於演技生硬的語劇將永無好感。</p>
<p>假使話劇運動者再不從奪取觀衆一點上注力，唯有眼看着一天天没落下去而已。但要怎樣才能奪取大量觀衆，除着力訓練演員的技術之外，最主要的是心理的轉變——即使是幼稚的觀衆，也不要放棄他們，大衆原是幼稚的，他們却正須敎育着，被你們養成有着高，級的欣賞力，不要讓他們儘看「濟公活佛」，也不要讓他們永遠只做「綠蜜劇塲的觀衆！</p>
<p>觀黃金新角以後</p>
<p>黃金　　的　　　　二　一日，和　上人仕在台上相見，記者得觀　盛，特誌如下：</p>
<p>第一天</p>
<p>吳彦衡的挑滑車未及八時已上塲，　氏的高　，扮相悬扮相，個子是個子，起　乾净俐落。嗓子亦　，唱唸　見精彩，大段石榴花，唱來　似小樓，大斗一聲更有　遏行　之妙，開打之聚湊，挑車之武工，在規矩中，　　火爆，下靶劉永利，　彦衡對打，種盡牡丹綠葉之妙。楊實森後演空城計，城樓一段，唱來韻味十足，幾句搖板，更佳腔百出，繼後，宋德珠打泡新安驛，因學荀慧生，但台步殊失荀之佳妙，跑來跑去，簡直在台上亂轉。唸白亦學慧生，極能動聽，嗓音略沙，但運腔得當，眞是不錯。做戲欠細腻，有時則過火，洞房塲平平而已。全劇以比武招親一塲最佳，與李德彬打對槍，可謂天衣無縫，妙到秋毫。李德彬之小生，雖能嚴守規範，但過於呆板。艾世菊依然故我，慈少泉嗓替轉亮，進步不少。</p>
<p>第二天</p>
<p>上塲彦衝演惡虎村，又是一番光景，身上脚下頗好，惡虎村一觑非武戲文唱不能討好，要能唱，能唸，能做，能打，才能勝任，彦衡可謂四者俱全，故演來自始至終，精彩到底。打鼓駡曹爲楊　森之看家戲，當然不錯，　森之鼓，向稱一絕，自非他人堪此，袁世海之曹操此馬駿好，聽鼓時有幾個郝派身段，不愧郝門弟子。後宋德珠演水漫金山寺，德珠扮白娘娘，求法海拔許仙一塲，身段繁多，演來頭頭是道，邊式美觀，蹻工更見工夫，毛世來閻世善不及　白　要好出一倍以上也。</p>
<p>東北的王先生　華志</p>
<p>華新公司自拍了滑稽趣味的「王先生吃飯難「王先生舆二房東」等片後，引起了社會深刻的印象。因爲王先生和他的搭擋小陳，王太太陳太太小阿媛，表現於孤鳥中下階級的顛沛生活，太刻劃入微了。王先生等一批典型人物，出自漫　家葉浅予的筆下，本來只有上海附近一帶的人認識他，自上了銀幕後，喧傳就廣。近來的王先生，已出現在東兰省，那邊的人據說也要拍王先生的片子了。事情是這樣開始的，有個在遼寗省瀋陽城出版的呌「東亞觀光」的藝聲雜誌，轉载了淺予畫，改名篇「陳君上京外史，」叙王先生小陳到南京做官故事，很受一般人的歡迎。有些投機家因聽說王先生的影片在上海很紅，他們也要仿製，就計劃起來，不過他們拍的是默片，也無湯傑一般標凖的人材，故成績據稱較遜云。</p>
<h3>藝壇簡報  華</h3>

<h3>自作聰明倒反弄出笑話</h3>
<p>至於十三妹旣嗣後在壁上題詩，當然不是爲懼怕而擦拭刀上之血，何况她明明是手持一把殺人不見血的寶刀，除却刀柄上或尚有沾血之可能，要说刀背刀刃上能沾上血去，那豈不是欺人之談麽，再者说縱命寶刀上不幸而留有血蹟，也決不至於像由河裏救人的一樣，控水控了怎麽半天呀。何况控之甩之不足，最後再向鞋底上一擦，那簡直眞把十三妹的這柄寶刀給駡苦啦。他又不會想到：何玉鳳原是纏足的漢人，並不是旗人的大脚爿，可憐三寸金蓮土，怎好把闊有四五寸長約二尺許的刀上兩面血蹟擦乾凈呢？這不又是一件不盡情理的專兒麼？試觀此劇中不過就是改了個靴鞋的裝束，然而已經弄出上面這段笑話來。由此可見素倡改良舊劇論者，切須瞻前顧後，考慮周至，方能不貽人以笑柄，但是這又談何容易呢！</p>
<p>嘗觀陳老夫子（德霖）飾「探母」中之蕭太后，蕖因在內廷供奉時習見西太后之背影，故於該劇臨下塲時，亦略傚西后之步法，及雍容大方之態度，復襯以据面上之鑼鼓。倒的確有個樣兒，後來王琴儂加　摹仿，也以此享名，晚近北平如諸茄香　雖唱工大差，然而單賣這幾步走，却亦博得觀衆歡迎，誰知演「十三妹」的某伶，更變本加厲，彼扮蕭太后一角，甫出塲時即一步一顛，儼如生角飾「天門走雪」曹福的身段台步一般，傴僂着腰，故意表示老態龍鍾的樣兒。（一〇七）</p>
<p>塲在辣斐獻演，並預備　大招待一次。</p>
<p>國華公司以後將全部攝製古裝片，幾個月前的申新兩報封面廣告上，已搜羅「杜十娘」「何文秀」等民間故事數十種。最近或許再要發表一次，</p>

        <h1>1939.09.26</h1>
<h3>German-Italian Peace Movement Fails; Western Front Warfare Intensifies; Air and Artillery Battles Fierce; General Offensive Commencement Unconfirmed; Germany Deploys Air Mines on the Western Front; Zeppelin Factory in Xu Berlin Reported Bombed</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland – It is heard here that there are fierce battles between French and German forces in the central part of the Western Front. This is a result of the French army's offensive along a 40-mile zigzagging line (extending eastward from the Saar River to the Vosges Mountains). It is said that both sides have added a large number of troops to the war, with the French army having tanks and fully equipped auxiliary units. Whether this battle is the starting point of a general offensive on one side, or the French army's attempt to repeatedly seize the positions that the German army recaptured during the counter-offensive in the middle of last week, is still unknown. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris – The German offensive on the Western Front has increased in strength and importance. It appears to be testing naval defenses in preparation for a large-scale offensive. Berlin claims that German troops have occupied French positions east and west of Wissembourg in Alsace-Lorraine, but France has firmly denied this. It is said that German troops have repeatedly tried to attack strong French positions within German territory, but have not succeeded. The French 75mm guns are superior to the German artillery fire. German troops attempted to occupy the hillside, but were ambushed by machine guns in the mountains. The French army is temporarily not penetrating deep into German territory, in order to concentrate on consolidating the occupied areas and resisting German attacks. The French front lines have reached the German defensive areas, with thirty to forty solid fortresses and outposts made of reinforced concrete per square mile. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Romanshorn, Switzerland – It is heard that a squadron of French or British aircraft bombed the Zeppelin factory in Friedrichshafen, Germany, between 9:00 PM and 11:00 PM last night. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris – According to news from here today, the French army has again pressed on German positions. Responsible parties often ask about the German activities of the past two days: Is this a show put on by the German army as Hitler is about to personally visit the Western Front, or is it a sudden attack on the French outposts in the hope of recapturing the lost territory between the Siegfried Line and the border? In any case, it is not easy for the German army to launch a strong attack, because the French have had more than a week to extend the defenses of their recently captured positions elsewhere. The French army has now built new artillery forts and installed barbed wire. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The fighting in the Saar region of the Western Front is fierce. German authoritative circles claimed last night that Germany intends to determine the outcome on the Western Front within a year. A German spokesperson stated, "It is infuriating that Germany does not prevent Britain from blockading German food supplies to trap Germany, but still waits passively behind the Western Front, awaiting the enemy's attack." German military circles admitted that German troops have begun to be transferred from Poland to the Rhine front. If the peace movement fails, German troops will launch a major offensive against the British and French armies. The 86th Division of the German army fighting on the Eastern Front remains mostly in Poland, while the German army on the Western Front numbers between 35 and 40 divisions. This is in case the final peace efforts fail. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Luxembourg – According to news from the front today, last night, the sound of artillery fire roared throughout the night between Chenqin and Wasserbillig along the Moselle River, interspersed with the intense, crisp sound of anti-aircraft guns. As reporters traveled along the west bank of the Moselle River, they saw many temporary defense lines deployed in the suburbs of German towns, especially in the areas of Tawern and Wincheringen. The best-concealed German forward outposts were hidden in forests and bushes. According to news from here, the Germans have densely planted landmines in front of the Siegfried Line. The French army is now moving towards the Luxembourg area to prevent the Germans from attacking through Luxembourg. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to a battlefield reporter for the "Roman People's Newspaper," German troops on the Western Front have repeatedly released "air mines," which are twenty times more powerful than ordinary landmines. These "air mines" are new weapons that consist of landmines attached to balloons, which are then detonated electrically. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to reports from special correspondents sent by various newspapers here to the German Western Front, the German army has deployed many small balloons equipped with explosives in the sky to intercept enemy aircraft. These balloons can be detonated from the ground, and it is extremely difficult for enemy aircraft flying nearby to escape.</p>
<p>Paris – The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 42, stating, "Our troops conducted local reconnaissance in many areas on the front line yesterday. Several enemy aircraft attempted to attack, but were successfully intercepted by our fighter planes. In addition, the enemy artillery units heavily bombarded our positions south of Deux-Ponts." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating, "Enemy and our aircraft engaged in air battles on the Western Front, and eight French aircraft were shot down. Both sides' artillery units and scout troops were also active in certain areas. One of our submarines was sunk by an enemy destroyer in a certain sea area." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>London – Although Germany is willing to defeat Britain and France with a blitzkrieg, Nazi leaders seem to disagree. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and extremists advocate attacking Britain and France through Belgium, while Air Force Chief Göring and moderates, who often pay attention to the United States, advocate respecting neutrality for the time being. It is important to note that Germany has a 300-mile line in Poland that must be garrisoned, while there are 4 million Soviet troops stationed outside the border. According to French confirmation, no new troops have come from Poland since the first batch of reinforcements was transferred to the Western Front. Therefore, some critics believe that Hitler may hold the Siegfried Line and invade the Netherlands in order to establish air bases near Britain. However, before this move, Hitler may have to put on another show to make the world believe that he really desires peace, but it is being destroyed by the Allied countries that are engaging in military buildup. According to Turkish official sources, the Turkish Foreign Minister will persuade the Soviet Union to guarantee to prohibit German ships from entering the Black Sea and to prevent the Balkans from being drawn into the war vortex. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union in Central Europe Seizes German Hegemony; German and Soviet Troops Advance Towards the Border; Large Numbers of Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Moscow</h3>
<p>Moscow – Soviet troops in Poland are currently busy taking over the positions occupied by the German army, in accordance with the Soviet-German border demarcation agreement. The Central Red Army is now less than 100 miles from Warsaw and can occupy the suburbs of Warsaw, Prague. Several trains, fully loaded with wounded Soviet soldiers, arrived in Moscow last night. This shows that the Polish army did resist the Soviet invasion. It is heard that Germany's cession of large tracts of Polish land has greatly increased the Soviet Union's power in the Black Sea, the Balkan Peninsula, and the Baltic Sea. Therefore, diplomatic circles are greatly concerned about the arrival of Estonian Foreign Minister Selter here last night and the expected arrival of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu in Moscow this afternoon. In light of the development of Soviet-German relations, outsiders predict that the future status of the Baltic states is very dangerous. Staff of the Polish embassy in the Soviet Union are still here, and the departure time has not yet been determined. It is heard that although the Soviet ambassador to Poland is here, the Soviet authorities are currently investigating the whereabouts and fate of the staff of the Soviet embassy in Warsaw. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German High Command issued a communiqué tonight stating that the German army continues to move towards the demarcation line in accordance with the entire plan on the Eastern Front. On the Western Front, there were fierce artillery battles everywhere, and enemy attacks were repelled. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The General Staff of the Soviet Red Army issued the following war bulletin on September 24: On September 24, the Red Army units continued to advance towards the determined border, occupying the towns of Sejny, Augustów, and Grodkówek, reaching the line of Augustów, Knyszyn, Bielsk Podlaski, Krasne (40 kilometers northwest of Brest-Litovsk), Bicze (20 kilometers southwest of the same city), Lubaczów (northwest of Hrubieszów, Uhnów, and Rawa Ruska, 20 kilometers), and occupying Komanów, Drohobycz, and Boryslav (towns southwest of Lviv). (TASS, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet Dnipro River Flotilla, moving upstream along tributaries, is continuing its advance within Polish territory. Yesterday, it reached the railway bridge piers of the cities of Luniniec and Sarny, encountering no resistance along the way and only clearing some of the mines laid by the Polish army. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Before withdrawing to the demarcation line agreed upon by Germany and the Soviet Union, the German army held a special ceremony at the Brest Fortress. The Soviet army received the fortress from the German army, and German and Soviet generals reviewed the troops of both countries. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow – A special correspondent for "Pravda" recently published an article in the newspaper describing the situation of the Soviet army taking over the city of Brest. It stated that German and Soviet officers met in the city of Brest at 7:00 PM on September 22 to complete the handover procedures. After the German commander's representative informed the Soviet officers of the local situation in the city, the Soviet army entered the city of Brest at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German Foreign Policy Director Weizsäcker and Soviet Russian Ambassador to Germany Shkvartsev exchanged the instruments of ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact concluded on August 23, 1939, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning. According to the pact, it has been in effect since the date of signing. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Vatican's Attention to the Church in Poland</h3>
<p>The future of the Catholic Church in Poland, especially in the part occupied by the Soviet Union, has aroused serious concern here. It is heard that the Pope is personally paying the closest attention to this situation. There have been no reports of religious persecution, but there are fears that the Soviet Union will eventually harass it. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Repeated Explosions in Germany; Carelessness in Factories and Coal Mines</h3>
<p>Lithuanian Capital – According to news from Berlin, an explosion occurred at the Chuculite factory in the town of Turnbullhof, near Berlin, on the 23rd of this month, and it was burned down. This is the fourth explosion in Berlin in recent days. The German authorities regard it as an organized sabotage movement and have taken various measures to prevent it. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The Bocheng coal mine in Westphalia, Prussia, exploded yesterday. It is now known that eight people died and forty were seriously injured. There are still nine miners whose escape routes are blocked, and it is feared that they have perished. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Bochum – The "Hanover" coal mine here exploded last night due to a lamp accident, killing seventeen people and seriously injuring fourteen. In order to extinguish the fire, a part of the ventilation system has been tightly sealed. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<h3>5,000 German Aircraft Bomb Poland; Conversation with the U.S. Ambassador to Poland</h3>
<p>Paris – U.S. Ambassador to Poland Biddle, who recently arrived here from Poland with his family via a detour, described how Germany used 5,000 warplanes to destroy Poland's production and transportation within a few days. It is said that German planes constantly traveled over Poland, making the entire hinterland a front line. German planes bombed aircraft factories, preventing them from working, and blocked train traffic and general transportation. The whole of Poland was therefore plunged into chaos for five days. It took the U.S. Ambassador fifteen days to travel from Warsaw via Romania to Paris, and he was at least three times under fire from German planes. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Thousands of Square Miles of Polish Territory Handed Over by the German Army to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital – The "National Daily" of Basel recently commented on the progress of the Soviet army in Poland, stating, "Germany sacrificed tens of thousands of soldiers to conquer thousands of square miles of Polish territory, which has now been handed over to the Soviet Union. What are the feelings of the German army when they are ordered to withdraw? The problem in Eastern Europe is complex, and there is still a crisis. Not only Germany, Hungary, and Romania, but also the Balkan countries. From then on, the actions of the Soviet government are even more important than the actions of the German government." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italy Promotes the Neutralization of the Balkans; Estonian Foreign Minister Arrives in Moscow; Bulgarian Aviation Representative Also Arrives</h3>
<p>Istanbul – Italy's withdrawal of unnecessary troops from the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea has aroused good impressions among Turkish people. Although this statement has yet to be confirmed, Turkish circles believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will still carry out his plan to neutralize the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. According to this plan, Italy has recently withdrawn troops stationed on the border between Albania and Greece. Turkey believes that Italy's garrison in the Dodecanese Islands near the Turkish Aegean coast is an organic and continuous threat. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German General Report," published an article today commenting on British diplomatic activities, stating that Britain originally planned to use the Balkan countries to form a siege line around Germany. Therefore, it made guarantees to several countries, but its intention was only for the benefit of Britain and its allies. In fact, there is a natural relationship between the Balkan countries and Germany. The exchange of certain goods benefits both sides. Germany has no political desires for Southeastern Europe. What it hopes for is that the countries of Southeastern Europe do not take risks lightly, so as not to hinder their own interests and relations with Germany. For the sake of the Balkans themselves, it would be best to follow the example of the Nordic countries and declare neutrality and stay out of the matter. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Estonian Foreign Minister Selter arrived here at 4:45 PM this afternoon and was immediately welcomed by Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Stepanov, and many other dignitaries. Foreign Minister Selter is scheduled to stay here for two days. According to official announcements, the purpose of this trip is to sign a new trade agreement with the Soviet authorities, but it is generally believed that when Foreign Minister Selter holds talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, various other issues, especially the neutralization and disarmament of the islands belonging to Estonia in the southern Gulf of Finland and the issue of a Polish submarine escaping from the port of Tallinn, Estonia, will be submitted for discussion. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Estonian Capital – Estonian Prime Minister Õunapuu delivered a speech at the beginning of the Air Defense Propaganda Week, reiterating Estonia's neutral attitude towards the European War. He said that the Polish government and the Polish state no longer exist, and Estonia's international status is guaranteed by its neutrality policy. The non-aggression pacts signed by Estonia with Germany and the Soviet Union have already taken effect. Estonia's neutrality requires the people of the whole country to adopt a neutral attitude and emotion in speech and in fact. Respect and friendship for domestic minorities are the main conditions for ensuring neutrality. The fact that the Estonian Foreign Minister is currently in Moscow negotiating a new trade agreement with the Soviet Union proves the friendly and normal relations between Estonia and the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet authorities yesterday announced a ban on foreign ships passing through the Newa River connecting the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga. Finnish ships are the most affected by this measure, as they have the right to pass through the river according to the 1923 Navigation Treaty. However, the treaty expressly stipulates that the Soviet government has the right to close it in wartime. Therefore, this decision is in accordance with the treaty. (Hai Dian, 25th)</p>
<p>Bulgarian Capital – Bulgarian Director of Commercial Aviation Botev set out for Moscow yesterday. It is said that regular air services will be opened between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria in the near future. This route may be extended to Athens, the capital of Greece. Political figures here hope that the Soviet Union and Bulgaria will sign a new commercial treaty in the near future to facilitate the exchange of goods between the two countries. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – According to news from Moscow today, Colonel Auders, Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgarian Air Force, has now arrived in Moscow and is preparing to stay in the Soviet Union for a week to hold important meetings with the Soviet National Defense Headquarters. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<h3>Warsaw Suffers Heavy Damage from German Artillery and Aircraft Bombardment; About 100 Fires in the City; German Troops in the East Have Been Repulsed</h3>
<p>Warsaw – The local radio station broadcast news at 8:00 PM this afternoon, stating that German artillery bombarded the city all day long, and many shells fell in the city center, causing many casualties. At the same time, many enemy planes came to bomb, and the Ujazdowski Hospital, which had a Red Cross flag, was bombed, and many wounded soldiers and women and children died. Enemy planes also dropped many incendiary bombs, and the National Opera House and other important buildings were set on fire, but "the citizens are spirited and determined to resist to the end." Although the enemy infantry units have repeatedly launched attacks, they have been repulsed by the defending troops. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>London – Warsaw radio reported that Warsaw was subjected to continuous bombardment yesterday. The Church of the Savior was hit by a bomb during mass, killing and injuring many people. A part of the Red Cross Hospital was also destroyed, and many wounded soldiers and women and children died in the hospital. German troops attempted to attack many times during the day, but were all repulsed by Polish soldiers in hand-to-hand combat. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – The Defense Headquarters broadcast a war bulletin last night stating, "German artillery has been bombarding our city and the Modlin fortress area all day long. There are very few houses in the city that remain intact. There are hundreds of fire pits in the 24 hours of yesterday, and the number of civilian casualties is extremely high. The enemy's siege of the Modlin area is very fierce, but it is still held by our troops. The enemy troops in the east of the city have been repulsed. On the left bank of the Vistula River, our army launched three counter-attacks last night, capturing many prisoners. The morale of the people in the city is very high." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital – Although the German side issued a communique yesterday stating that the Polish war has ended, according to news received by the Basel Newspaper in Switzerland, the Polish army is still continuing to resist, and is organizing secret groups in the occupied areas, similar in nature to those organized by the Polish national hero and former Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, during the last European war to resist Russia, but on a larger scale, and aimed at resisting both Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris – Military experts here recently commented on the Polish army's resistance, saying that the Polish army's defense of Warsaw was very brave. Previously, when the German side advanced deep alone, the Polish army could have taken advantage of its fatigue to launch a heavy blow, but because the Soviet army suddenly entered and attacked its rear, it led to an irreparable defeat. In terms of the geographical situation of Poland, it was originally in a disadvantageous position militarily. In addition, in order to make world opinion aware of its efforts to seek peace, the Polish government did not implement general mobilization until the last minute. This delay in opportunity was undeniable. The deployment of Polish army units at the beginning of this month was as follows: (1) One army each was stationed in the northern cities of Suwałki and Mława to defend against the German East Prussian army. (2) One army was deployed in the corridor area, commanded by General Bortnowski. Later, due to the unfavorable terrain of the corridor, General Bortnowski withdrew the main force to the southern area after obtaining the consent of the General Headquarters. (3) Two large armies were deployed in the central region to defend the western border, one in the northwest in the province of Poznań, commanded by General Kutrzeba, and the other in the southwest in the province of Upper Silesia, taking a strategic position with the defenders of Częstochowa. (4) One army was stationed along the Beskidy Mountains in the southwest to defend the southwestern border, with the province of Kraków as its base. As for the industrial area in the eastern part of Silesia, which had no defenses, it was originally planned to be destroyed and implement a scorched earth policy when the German army attacked. Later, the army unified by German General Kluge entered the corridor, and the army unified by General Reichenau entered Upper Silesia, immediately encircling the Polish army from both flanks. There were a total of three attempts, all of which failed. Although the Polish army's communication lines were completely destroyed by the German army, it was still able to withdraw eastward in an orderly manner and was not completely annihilated by the German army. Only one army in the province of Poznań was blocked between Kutno and Łódź. The Polish army then fiercely resisted in Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk, which was very successful. The German army's advance was greatly frustrated. At that time, the Polish army could have launched a counter-offensive in the central region to relieve the siege of the garrison in the province of Poznań, but the Soviet Union suddenly sent troops to attack its back, causing the Polish army to miss a good opportunity to turn defeat into victory, which is regrettable.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Question of Revising the American Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>America's traditional foreign policy is divided into three aspects according to region: towards Europe, advocating neutrality and avoiding entanglement in the vortex of war as much as possible; towards the Far East, adhering to the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity; and towards the Americas, rejecting foreign influence, i.e., implementing the "Monroe Doctrine." National policy is subject to fluctuations due to changing circumstances, but its essence remains constant. In the two years since the outbreak of war in the Far East, the United States has grasped its Far Eastern policy with a combination of firmness and flexibility. Recently, the unfortunate outbreak of war in Europe has once again presented the most serious test of the American neutrality policy. As for the Americas, Germany and Japan have long been engaged in conspiratorial activities in Mexico and Central and South America; and after Canada declared war on Germany, the United States immediately felt the extension of the state of war to its northern neighbor. With such complex international relations, how can the United States stand outside the vortex while taking into account all three aspects of its national policy? This is what the American authorities are pondering and anxious about.</p>
<p>Currently, international attention is focused on the revision of the Neutrality Act in the special session of the U.S. Congress. This newspaper has already pointed out the various shortcomings of the current U.S. Neutrality Act. (See editorials of January 7th and March 11th of this year); President Roosevelt has been doing his utmost to advocate revision so that he can maintain neutrality on the one hand and sanction aggression on the other. His painstaking efforts are worthy of admiration. Today, let us briefly analyze whether the revision of the Neutrality Act can be implemented in this special session and the impact of the revision on the Far Eastern situation.</p>
<p>First, we should be clear that the revision of the Neutrality Act is not related to American national policy; even if the amendment fails, it does not mean that American national policy has overturned its traditional spirit and adopted isolationism. It can only be seen as a victory for the Republican Party's political warfare. In other words, the current issue of revising the Neutrality Act has changed from a foreign policy issue to a political struggle between the Democratic and Republican parties, which is significantly different from the situation at the beginning of this year. But in our observation, the revision of the Neutrality Act is very likely: (1) Although the Neutrality Act has the significance of avoiding involvement in the vortex of war, its impact has caused significant damage to American industry and commerce. Automobile King Ford once said, "The only people who want to revise the Neutrality Act are those who want to take advantage of it to manufacture arms on a large scale for profit," which is somewhat exaggerated, but it also reveals a part of the truth. Even President Roosevelt has publicly stated that "the shelving of the Neutrality Act amendment seems harmful to industry and commerce." Since the expiration of the "cash and carry" clause on May 30th of this year, the United States has been absolutely unable to export arms to any belligerent country. This matter, in a political sense, is enough to encourage Hitler and disappoint Britain and France, not to mention that in an economic sense, it is not tolerable to American industry and commerce. So we can imagine that American arms dealers, financial groups, and general industry and commerce will inevitably exert strong pressure on members of Congress. (2) Since the outbreak of the European war, American public opinion has become increasingly strong in advocating the revision of the Neutrality Act, and all newspapers in the country, except for the Hearst system, are supporting President Roosevelt; America is a democratic country, and public opinion has authority. (3) The above-mentioned amendment was shelved in the vote of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by only one vote; and many of the senators who advocated delaying the discussion assumed that the European war would not break out. Now that the European war has not only broken out, but also has a tendency to prolong and expand, the premise of the assumption no longer exists.</p>
<p>What is worrying is that the issue of revising the Neutrality Act has unfortunately become a tool of political struggle. Originally, whether the Neutrality Act should be revised and what the advantages and disadvantages are vary from person to person. The debate between the two sides in Congress had long been exhausting, and all members of Congress, except for a few so-called "die-hards," had long been tired of hearing it and thought that revision or no revision was fine, and had no preconceived notions. Only those "die-hards" and opposition parties took the opportunity to engage in activities, vigorously spreading the word that President Roosevelt plans to participate in the third presidential election next year, but because domestic affairs are unsatisfactory, he plans to regain his lost prestige in foreign policy. Recently, Landon, the Republican presidential candidate who failed in the previous election, also publicly stated that he does not oppose the Neutrality Act amendment, but it should be conditional on Roosevelt's declaration not to participate in the third election, saying that Roosevelt hopes to use the revision of the Neutrality Act to eliminate party opinions, which is not fair. That is simply admitting frankly that the Neutrality Act is a tool of political struggle, which is enough to make outsiders feel chilled! Everyone has a sense of shame, and the great American citizens must be able to clarify this atmosphere!</p>
<p>As for the impact of the Neutrality Act on the Far East, Japan has never hoped that the Neutrality Act can be revised, because the United States' export of arms benefits Britain and France, but at the same time, it also benefits Japan, which has a huge navy and merchant fleet. But the problem is not that simple, because China and Japan have not declared war, which is fundamentally unrelated to the Neutrality Act; second, China actually buys very few arms from the United States and does not use this as a source of resistance; and third, Japan's gold is running out and it cannot afford to buy large quantities. Moreover, the United States has long had the determination to formulate separate measures for the Far East, but it cannot be implemented immediately because of the obstruction of US-Japan trade; now that US-Japan trade will expire next spring, when to renew the rights is not in Japan. Even if Japan can take advantage of the revised Neutrality Act, at most it will be only two or three months. Not only that, in this special meeting of the US Congress, I heard that there are also four proposals to deal with Japan, and we can pay attention to its whereabouts!</p>
<h3>Britain and France Reject Mussolini's Mediation; German Press Praises Italy's Mediation; Italian Press Claims Central Europe Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain will address the House of Commons tomorrow and reply to the proposal of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to mediate the European war. The Information Department criticized Mussolini's speech on Saturday, stating, "Britain's principles remain unchanged and will be implemented with unwavering determination." (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's remarks on Saturday that Europe has not yet entered a state of war internationally have aroused semi-official criticism from the French side, believing that Britain and France have already made it clear that they will fulfill their mutual assistance agreement to protect Poland. At the same time, London welcomes Mussolini's statement that Italy will continue to be neutral and avoid expanding the conflict. As for Italy's preparations to deal with all events, it is considered a natural precautionary plan that all neutral countries must take. However, the British side finds it difficult to agree with Mussolini's opinion that hostile actions can be stopped now, because the British war aims have been clearly announced by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and cannot be changed due to the temporary collapse of Poland. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Fascist Party is quite disappointed with the response of Britain and France to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's call for an end to the European war. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, published an opinion in the Italian People's Daily, saying that if this opportunity is not accepted, the turmoil will spread to Central Europe. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The "German General Report," reflecting the views of the German Foreign Ministry, commented on Mussolini's speech in yesterday's article, stating that the Italian Prime Minister recognized the responsibility of leading Italy, a world power, and the protector of Fascism, and made appropriate remarks to the people of the country and the world on the current situation and its consequences. Mussolini exposed the double policy of the democratic countries towards Poland and restoring Poland in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles as an illusion, because the Soviet Union's participation in the Polish war has eliminated the possibility of restoring Poland. The report believes that Mussolini will maintain a "wait-and-see" attitude and be prepared to deal with any extraordinary events. The report concluded that Mussolini can represent the true peace front and represent the majority of people who hope to localize the war and limit the war period. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Political figures in Berlin believe that it is expected that Britain and France will reject Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal to localize the war, but they are very surprised by the lack of sufficient reasons for the rejection. The reasons of Britain and France are nothing more than that Britain and France declared war on Germany because they had an obligation to assist Poland. However, the Soviet Union's position on Poland is the same as Germany's. Why don't Britain and France declare war on Russia? Political figures in Berlin pointed out that Prime Minister Mussolini's proposal at this time was not accidental, but because the first phase of the war had come to an end, it was an appropriate time to mediate peace. Now that his proposal has been rejected, Italy's attitude must be affected. As for Germany, whether it has the confidence of final victory or enters a new stage of the war, it has the supply of a large number of minerals and agricultural products from Poland, and the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in military, economic, and political aspects. If Britain and France want to reject the peace talks, they should go to the end. According to Berlin political circles, in the international arena, Britain originally hoped that Japan would adopt a pro-British attitude, but due to German diplomatic intervention, the Soviet Union and Japan have signed a truce agreement, and Britain has felt disappointed. In addition, Romania has adopted an isolationist attitude towards Britain, and Turkey is also working hard to adjust relations with the German-Soviet group. It can be seen from this that the international situation is not necessarily favorable to Britain and France. However, Germany has no demands on Britain and France, so it does not start an attack on the Western Front, but is waiting in strict array. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<h3>German Propaganda Minister Refutes Rumors</h3>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that Propaganda Minister Goebbels made a speech to the newspapers yesterday, first stating that he had issued a statement some time ago that the neutrality of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg should be respected, and now he is willing to declare that other neutral countries are also respected by Germany. A newspaper in a certain country once carried a report that six leaders of the German National Socialist Party possessed huge amounts of money and had secretly deposited them abroad, which is absolutely untrue. This was fabricated by an American journalist, Hungerbock, who was in London at the time. I believe this is a lie made by the British intelligence department. At that time, it was rumored that the private property of the main figures of the National Socialist Party totaled 900,000 pounds, or 500 million marks. This statement was then published by American newspapers, and British and French newspapers were also happy to reprint it. At this time, even the newspapers of various neutral countries were competing to publish the war. In order to counter this lie, I only have one method of counterattack, and because Hungerbock claims to have various documents sufficient to prove that we actually have funds deposited in banks in the United States and Britain, I used radio broadcasting to ask him to publish these documents in the newspapers of the United States and Britain. I am willing to offer a commission for each sum of money. If Hungerbock does have such documents, he only needs to lift a hand to earn 50 million marks within 24 hours (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>British and French Diplomatic Authorities Meet with Soviet Ambassador; Germany and the Soviet Union Have Different Dreams; It Is Considered Still Usable</h3>
<p>Paris - Foreign Minister Tribert met with Soviet Ambassador Suritz this morning for a long time. Political figures commented on this, saying that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday. From this, it can be seen that Britain and France and the Soviet Union can maintain their diplomatic normalcy and talk to each other to determine their intentions. In addition, the Turkish diplomatic representative Sarajoğlu is visiting the Soviet Union at this time. Combining the trends of all parties, it is worthwhile to pay attention. Regarding the events in Eastern Europe, from the perspective of the position adopted by France in diplomacy, political figures recently made the following remarks, stating that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini once said in his speech that if Britain and France were really fighting for Poland, why not declare war on the Soviet Union? It is known that Britain and France declared war on Germany because they received an application from Poland on September 1, and immediately provided assistance in accordance with the mutual assistance agreement. However, Poland did not make the same request after the Soviet army entered the country, and from a military point of view, the Western European countries could not directly attack the Soviet Union, so declaring war would not help Poland, let alone promote practical political cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union. This is unwise and does not need to be said. The German-Soviet agreement may not last long, and this war will last for a long time. For this reason, although the Soviet Union is in the position of an accomplice to Germany, since the country has declared that it will continue to maintain neutrality, it is better to formally accept it than to reject it in vain. In short, this war is a long-term war of attrition. The conflicting goals of Germany and the Soviet Union are numerous. The union between the two is only temporary. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>桂林 - A few Japanese troops were found on the north bank of the Guishui River Jiatang (northwest of 汨罗) on the morning of the 24th and are currently confronting the Chinese army across the river. Dozens of Japanese cavalrymen are also harassing Qingniwan, west of the river. (25th)</p>
<p>桂林 - A part of the Japanese army that landed at Yingtian arrived at Dongtang Nanhu (southeast of Yingtian) on the morning of the 25th. The battle there is extremely fierce.

<p>桂林 - The Japanese army that crossed the Xinqiang River on the 24th fought fiercely with the Chinese army near Changhu (southeast of Xinqiang) all day. A force of more than 5,000 people invaded southwest of Dajing Street (northwest of Changle Street) at noon, seemingly trying to spy on Changle. The Chinese army is intercepting with strong forces. The Japanese army at the Xinqiang intersection moved southwest on the morning of the 25th, seemingly intending to attack Hua汨罗. The Chinese side is strictly guarding against it. (25th)</p>
<p>重庆 - According to the news here today, the offensive of the Japanese army in northern Hunan, both land and sea, was annihilated by the Chinese army on Saturday and Sunday, killing more than 3,000 people.

<p>重庆 - The war in northern Hunan is still going on on both sides of the Xinqiang River. It is reported that since September 18, the Japanese side has suffered as many as 10,000 casualties. The general public attaches great importance to the current war in northern Hunan, because it can test the strength of the Chinese and Japanese armies after two years of war. Whether the Japanese army can still attack and what kind of performance the Chinese army will have after two years of training and re-equipment can all be known from this. This war in northern Hunan only concerns the fate of Changsha and cannot determine the final victory or defeat, but its results can reveal the future military positions of China and Japan. According to the Chinese side, the purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Changsha is only to set off firecrackers to decorate the "new government" that is about to be formed. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>高安 - After the Japanese army was defeated in Gaoan, they gathered more than 2,000 remnants and invaded west from Fengxin on the 23rd, launching fierce battles with the Chinese army near Yecheng in Shangfu for days. The Chinese army bravely fought back, forcing back the Japanese army and killing more than 200 people. Starting on the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army attempted to attack again fiercely, and the battle became more intense. Until the afternoon, the fighting was still mixed near Shangfu. After the Japanese army on the front line of Gaoan suffered a major blow, they did not dare to invade again, and the war turned silent. (25th)</p>
<p>桂林 - The center of the war in central Jiangxi seems to have shifted between Fengxin and Shangfuzhen. More than 2,000 Japanese troops in Xubu arrived in Luofang Yecun on the 23rd and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. Also, the Japanese army in Nanshanhe was repelled by the Chinese army on the morning of the 24th, suffering heavy casualties. (25th)</p>
<p>常德 - Japanese warships in Dongting Lake have been harassing everywhere recently. They attacked and occupied Liuxingshan on the evening of the 23rd.

Also, the Japanese army that entered Heye Lake by speedboat repeatedly attempted to land forcibly in Shangzhongxiqingshan and other places on the evening of the 23rd, but was repelled by the Chinese army. Also, more than 20 Japanese speedboats repeatedly attempted to land forcibly in Xiaobozhen Lingmiaozui and other places from the evening of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th. After being surrounded and severely attacked by the Chinese army, 200 Japanese troops were killed. The remaining Japanese troops fled by speedboat. (25th)</p>
<p>重庆 - According to the Dagong Daily, the offensive of 60,000 Japanese troops against northern Hunan, which began last weekend, has caused the waters of the Xinqiang River to turn completely red due to the Chinese army's indomitable response. The Japanese army, with the fierce bombardment of 30 gunboats and the assistance of 200 speedboats, was able to land at Yingtian, 47 miles north of Changsha. Before the Japanese army successfully landed at Yingtian, there were dozens of tug-of-war battles, and both sides suffered extremely heavy casualties. As for Xiangyin, 7 miles south of Yingtian, it was completely bombed by Japanese aircraft on Saturday and Sunday. According to Huafang military intelligence, the commander of the Japanese army is Nishihara, the commander of the Japanese division. Nishihara's strategy is different from the side wing flanking strategy that the Japanese side is happy to use, and he is good at breaking through the middle. Nishihara was originally in the Nomonhan area. Recently, the Japanese side planned to attack Changsha and Yichang, so he was transferred to the Dongting Lake area. As for those who lead the Chinese army, they are Xue Yue and Guan Linzheng, both of whom are brave and good at fighting. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>重庆 - According to a Hua Fang strategist told the Associated Press reporter that the current war in northern Hunan is the largest war since the fall of Wuhan and Nanchang. The goal of the Japanese army's attack this time is obviously Changsha. When Wuhan fell last year, Hua Fang had expected that the Japanese army would attack Changsha in one go, but after capturing Wuhan, the Japanese side was obviously exhausted, so they had to give up their attempt to occupy Changsha at that time. The senior Hua Fang strategist also said that since the fall of Wuhan and Nanchang, in terms of Hua Fang's entire occupation, Changsha's position is no longer important, but the purpose of Hua Fang sending elite troops to guard northern Hunan is not only to defend Changsha, but also to deplete the Japanese army's military fire and manpower. In the second phase of the war of resistance, the strategy adopted by Hua Fang is to use various opportunities to deplete the strength of the Japanese side in preparation for the third phase of the war of resistance. He also said that the Chinese army in northern Hunan has fought very bravely for a week and has caused more than 6,000 casualties to the Japanese army so far. As for the current strategy adopted by the Japanese army in northern Hunan, it is Nishihara's strategy. The breakthrough on the Nanchang front last time was due to his strategy. Now that the Japanese side plans to attack Changsha and transfer Nishihara from the Hashinle River, they will of course follow his old strategy. According to the current plan of the Japanese side, it seems that they will first take Changsha, and then advance along the highway to the northwest to Shashi Yichang. At the same time, they will also go south from Changsha to open up the Yuehan Road, trying to establish contact with the Japanese army in northern Guangdong. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>长沙 - The Xinqiang 汨罗 lines launched bloody battles at the same time on the evening of the 24th and the morning of the 25th. A part of the Japanese army that sneaked across the Xinqiang River joined those who landed at the Jiuma Mouth of the Deer Horn and invaded south in two ways. One way invaded Rongjiawan and Huangsha Street along the railway, and the other way invaded the Changhu Highway along the Xinqiang to 汨罗口 Road. At the same time, the Japanese army that occupied Yingtian also invaded east along the south bank of the 汨罗 River, seemingly trying to capture 汨罗 in three ways. The Chinese army, with the morale of fighting more and more bravely, determined to succeed or die, and respectively fought against the Japanese army on the Xinqiang 汨罗 lines, and broke each of the Japanese armies. In this battle, the Japanese army left more than 2,000 corpses between Xinqiang and 汨罗, of which the corpses of Japanese officers and cadres accounted for more than 60. The Chinese army also captured many people and seized countless rifles, warhorses, and other military supplies. When the war was tense, the people on both sides of the 汨罗 River either lived peacefully or assisted in the war, which made the soldiers on the front line even more courageous. According to Takahashi Isshiki, the squad leader of the 116th Regiment of the 13th Division of the captured Japanese army, in this battle in northern Hunan, in addition to the ×th, ××th, and ××th Divisions and the Marine Corps, because of the heavy casualties from continuous attacks, the ×th Division, which is known for its combat effectiveness, has recently been newly transferred to reinforce it. The losses of the Japanese army can be seen from this. Also, after noon on the 25th, the Xinqiang 汨罗 lines were still in fierce fighting. (25th)</p>

<h3>Ferocious Battle on Hongtun Road Lasts for Ten Days; Chinese Army Wins Repeated Victories; Intense Street Fighting Erupts in Fucheng Town; Japanese Reinforcements Suffer Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The battle situation on Hongtun Avenue has become increasingly fierce since the 10th. The Japanese army entrenched in Fucheng Town was besieged by the Chinese army's ×× unit. They broke in through the southwest gate, resulting in intense street fighting. On the 16th, 600-700 Japanese soldiers from Hongdong reinforced, and 500-600 Japanese soldiers from Beiping Town also took the opportunity to invade from the south, attempting to coordinate with the Fucheng battle. They were intercepted by the Chinese army's ×× unit in Caoyu Village and Chuan Town, respectively, resulting in heavy casualties for the Japanese. On the 17th, the Chinese × unit continued to clear out the Japanese forces retreating to the central area of Fucheng, and the street fighting intensified. On the same day, hundreds of Japanese soldiers from Anze came to aid via Gao Village East, and more than a thousand Japanese soldiers arrived from Linfen to Xiwu Cen (east of Fushan). Another 400-500 Japanese soldiers from Fushan invaded Shanjiao Village in the southeast. After receiving reinforcements, the Japanese army in Fucheng also invaded Sanguanbu Xiangmunao and other places on the 20th. With the cover of fierce artillery fire, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers who passed through Xiwu Cen sneaked into Mabi Village on the 20th (northeast of Qinshui). After the Chinese ×× unit launched a large-scale counterattack on the 21st and 22nd, attacking from both the north and south, the Japanese could not withstand it and retreated. The Chinese × unit then ambushed them in Caojia Cen and Songshu Bei (both northwest of Mabi). The Japanese suffered even heavier casualties. Currently, most of the Japanese have escaped from Xiwu Cen, with a part hiding in various valleys, and the Chinese are searching. In summary, since the situation on the Hongtun Highway became tense, after ten days of fierce fighting, the Chinese army has been winning repeated victories. The Japanese army has suffered nearly a thousand casualties. The Chinese army has also captured one artillery piece, 60-70 rifles, and a large amount of other military supplies.

This proves that the representatives of the twenty-one American republics unanimously believe that this conference must achieve various practical results so that the Western Hemisphere will not encounter crises in the economic and other aspects due to Germany's aggressive actions. Representatives of various countries all expressed sympathy for the British and French people here. Conversely, the nineteen German expatriates here are no less than "isolated." The general opinion can be seen here. Foreign observers here also said that since US President Roosevelt came to power, the relationship between American countries has obviously made great progress. The policies promoted by Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles have sufficient reason to be clearly demonstrated at this conference, that is, "the united relationship between American countries is not a castle in the sky" and will become more and more obvious. The issues to be discussed at this conference are nothing more than (1) the protection of American transportation lines, (2) the protection of the territories of American countries, (3) the adjustment of the economic life of American countries since the outbreak of the European war. In addition, representatives of various countries will also consult on the establishment of joint "customs" of a permanent or semi-permanent nature in the American countries to study various issues at any time.

<p>Washington: The State Department yesterday announced new regulations to effectively monitor the actions of foreign representatives. Hereafter, agents of various countries must register every six months, but legitimate merchants are exempt. Furthermore, US citizens and foreign expatriates who wish to engage in political activities for foreign ideologies should register in advance in accordance with the order. As for consular officials who do not have diplomatic status, they must also register uniformly. (Associated Press telegram of the 25th)</p>
<h3>US Neutrality Act Amendment Introduced to Senate Foreign Relations Committee</h3>
<p>Washington: Biderman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday afternoon invited Democratic members who favored repealing the arms embargo clause to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment drafted by him. Afterwards, it was submitted to the secretariat of the committee today as a basis for discussion. It is heard that there are four main points: (1) Repeal the arms embargo clause; (2) Apply the "cash-and-carry" clause uniformly to the transportation of various goods to belligerent countries; (3) Severely punish those who violate the Neutrality Act; (4) Restrictions must be placed on the granting of commercial credit to belligerent countries. Regarding this point, the current Neutrality Act stipulates that US citizens can still grant "normal short-term commercial credit" to belligerent countries. There are many congressmen who advocate maintaining this provision. Biderman's proposal is likely to arouse strong opposition. (Havas telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt, who is now spending the weekend holiday in Hyde Park, ordered his special train to be fired up and ready to depart this morning. The President will return to Washington to personally participate in the debate on amending the Neutrality Act. Biderman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the proposal to amend the Neutrality Act can be discussed in Congress this week. According to the Associated Press reporter's investigation yesterday, 51 senators support amending the Neutrality Act, 25 oppose it, and 20 are unclear. (Associated Press telegram of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Turkey Increases National Defense Expenditures</h3>

<h3>Soviet Trade Representative to Germany Expands Scope</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland: The National Daily recently published a telegram from Berlin stating that the number of staff members of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in Germany, which had been reduced to 40, has now been expanded, adding 100 employees, and will be expanded to 400 thereafter.

<h3>British Intelligence Agency Refutes German Claims</h3>
<p>London: According to the intelligence agency, although the German Foreign Ministry's recently published documents on the final stage of the German-Polish dispute have been disguised in many ways, it is difficult to erase the truth or blame others for the war. The German government did not mention a word about the illegal appointment of Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party in Danzig, as the head of the Free City of Danzig, or the fact that the British government had opposed Germany from the beginning using an ultimatum to demand that Polish representatives must arrive in Berlin by midnight on August 30 to receive the proposal. Germany then said that it had delivered its proposals to the British Ambassador Henderson and explained it in detail to him, but did not specify the date. Germany criticized Britain for rejecting Italy's mediation, but also explained that Britain had stated that it would refuse negotiations unless Germany stopped attacking Poland and agreed to withdraw German troops from Polish territory. In this German document, the meetings between the British Ambassador and Hitler on August 23, 25, 28, and 29, and the meetings between the British Ambassador and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the evenings of August 30 and 31 are not mentioned. Therefore, the content does not seem very accurate. The reason why Hitler and Ribbentrop did not show the people the situation in the country during these two days is very obvious. They have various motivations and do not want to show the German people and the world the truth, that is, that the crisis was caused by Germany's actions. (Reuters telegram of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Swedish and Finnish Cargo Ships Sunk by German Submarines En Route; British Cargo Ship Halsall Also Suffers Disaster</h3>
<p>Oslo: The Swedish merchant ship Ballater, weighing 1,500 tons, was sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes 15 miles off Langsund on the southern coast of Norway. A Norwegian torpedo boat saw it and often sent 18 to 20 Swedish sailors ashore. The ship was carrying paper pulp to England. This is the fourth ship sunk by German submarines off the coast of the Scandinavian Peninsula in three days. At the same time, according to Berlin news, German officials agreed with the sinking of two Finnish ships carrying celluloid to the UK at the end of the week, saying that if German submarine captains allowed ships carrying military supplies to sail to the UK, they would be committing treason. (Reuters telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The British cargo ship "Halsall" was sunk by a German submarine near Cork yesterday. Among the 34 crew members, two women escaped in a lifeboat and 12 were missing. It is said that the ship was attacked without any warning. Three people were shot. (Associated Press telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The "Handelsblad" published today a list of merchant ships sunk from September 2 to 23. It is said that a total of 41 merchant ships were sunk, including 31 British ships, 4 German ships, 2 Finnish ships, 1 Dutch ship, 1 Greek ship, 1 Belgian ship, and 1 Norwegian ship. The newspaper stated that the British ships sunk totaled 140,445 tons, accounting for 0.75% of the total tonnage of merchant ships, and the lost fishing boats are not included. The German merchant ships lost accounted for only 0.33% of the total tonnage. (Haitong telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden: Two Finnish ships, carrying celluloid and wood pulp, were sunk in the Kattegat Strait (between Norway and Denmark) by German submarines. Upon hearing the news, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in Northern Europe were worried about the escalation of German submarine warfare. The Finnish newspaper "Uusi Suomi" stated that celluloid and wood pulp are not contraband, and it is not appropriate to allow submarine captains to decide what goods are contraband. The Finnish newspaper "Hufvudstadsbladet" stated that it is undoubtedly clear that Finnish ships did not carry contraband. Sweden, as a celluloid exporting country, naturally feels anxious. The "Svenska Dagbladet" stated that the celluloid carried by the ships is not contraband for either Britain or Germany. The "Dagens Nyheter" stated that Germany claimed that it would not interfere with neutral countries' trade, but now it has gone back on its word. The "Aftonbladet" stated that the Swedish authorities intend to request an explanation from the German government regarding this matter. (Havas telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden: The Swedish cargo ship "Gertrud Bratt", carrying a batch of celluloid for papermaking to the UK, was sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes en route. The Swedish newspapers were already very anxious about the sinking of two Finnish ships by German submarines yesterday. Upon hearing this news, they became even more uneasy and indignant, as can be seen in today's newspaper comments. The newspapers all said that celluloid should not be considered contraband, and this item is not included in the German list of contraband. Sweden's interests, which are closely related to foreign trade and survival, will be greatly threatened by German submarine warfare. The "Svenska Dagbladet" stated, "German Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder recently issued a statement that he would not interfere with the trade of neutral countries. This matter is contrary to the above statement. It seems that most of Sweden's export goods have been included in the German contraband list. Our country's import and export trade will be impossible to maintain in the future." The "Dagens Nyheter" stated, "Celluloid is an important export product of our country, and we should continue to find ways to export it and resolutely resist Germany's claims."

<p>Capital of Sweden: A Polish submarine recently sought refuge in a Swedish port and was detained by the Swedish authorities, along with the crew. This is the third Polish submarine to seek refuge in a Swedish port. (Havas telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Capital of Lithuania: Regarding the sinking of two Finnish ships by German submarines, according to reliable sources, Finnish Minister to Germany Wu Limaia protested to Germany because of this. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop replied that German submarines are allowed to sink ships of various countries carrying celluloid in wartime, which is permitted by custom, and neutral countries should regard this as a warning when transporting goods to the UK. (Havas telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>London: The British cargo ship Halsallside was sunk by a German submarine. Twelve crew members are missing, including the captain, chief mate, and third mate. According to a wireless telegram from the ship, the German submarine fired without warning. Two crew members died on the spot. Although the captain tried to escape quickly, there was no chance. Two lifeboats were destroyed, so 15 crew members escaped in a small boat that usually only carries seven people, and seven others left the ship on a raft. (Reuters telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The German side claimed that the three Finnish ships sunk by German submarines in the past three days carried celluloid that could be used to make explosives, and the location of the three ships was too far from Germany to be detained, so they were sunk. According to Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko, the UK has detained thousands of tons of celluloid bound for Germany, so Germany has taken this action to show retaliation.

<h3>New Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Takes Office Yesterday; Will Adopt a Policy of Amity with the United States</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, this afternoon, Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, President of Gakushuin, took office as Foreign Minister. The appointment ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace, and Prime Minister Abe also attended. According to well-informed sources, Abe's selection of Nomura as Foreign Minister shows that the Japanese government is paying close attention to the adjustment of US-Japan relations. (Telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch, according to qualified observers here, after Nomura takes office as Foreign Minister, the steps he will take will be based on the basic foreign policy formulated after the Abe cabinet was formed, which includes (1) concentrating all efforts on resolving the "China Incident"; (2) not interfering in the European war and adhering to Japan's independent position; (3) adjusting foreign relations to avoid unnecessary friction. Since the outbreak of the European war, the importance of US-Japan relations has been increasing. After Nomura takes office, he seems to be adopting a policy of amity with the United States, first paying attention to the adjustment of US-Japan relations. According to reports, the name of Yosuke Matsuoka is most loudly called for the new ambassador to the United States. Matsuoka has served as the president of Mantetsu and the chief representative of Japan to the League of Nations. After the "September 18th" Incident, he led the Japanese delegation to withdraw from the League of Nations. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, in addition to the transfer of Sawada to the ambassador to France and the appointment of former plenipotentiary minister to China Tani Masayuki as a director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the new Foreign Minister will make major changes to diplomatic personnel. Ambassador to Italy Shiratori has already departed for home, and Ambassador to Germany Oshima has also been recalled home. The successor to the ambassador to Italy will be transferred from the ambassador to Sweden, Eiji Amau, and the successor to the ambassador to Germany is still under careful consideration. (Telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After the appointment ceremony of Foreign Minister Nomura at 3 p.m. on the 25th, he will meet with Prime Minister Abe at the Prime Minister's official residence to discuss the comprehensive renewal of Japan's diplomatic lineup under the dedicated Foreign Minister. First, Minister Tani Masayuki will be appointed as the next director to fill the vacancy after Director Sawada is transferred to Ambassador to France, which will be discussed and decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 26th. Furthermore, the two will exchange views on the issue of the change of ambassadors to the United States and ministers to European countries. It is said that a policy has been decided for the selection of the ambassador to the United States, and it is planned to break the past model and appoint someone outside of Kasumigaseki. Prime Minister Abe previously recommended Yosuke Matsuoka as a suitable person, so if the new Foreign Minister Nomura can agree, Yosuke Matsuoka will be quickly appointed as the ambassador to the United States.

<h3>A Comparative View of the Two European Wars (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Chuxiang</p>
<p>For years, Britain's policy of tolerating Hitler was not without reason. She feared France's dominance and took precautions to prevent it. Therefore, she pulled up Germany to restrain France. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression pact, they both indicated that Britain desperately wanted them to be enemies, which was also based on the recognition of Britain's role. In general, if we acknowledge that the Sarajevo incident was the fuse of the previous Great War, and that Germany fought to fulfill its alliance with Austria, and Britain fought to maintain Belgium's neutrality, etc., were all excuses, then we must also acknowledge that the Danzig and Corridor issues were the fuse of this Great War, and that Britain and France fought to fulfill their promise to Poland, and Germany fought to lift the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and Poland's mistreatment of Germans, etc., were all excuses. Regardless of their proclaimed war aims, if we consider them comprehensively, it is more appropriate to say that Germany was pursuing a policy of dominance in Europe, which Britain could not tolerate, and France was even more unwilling to sit idly by, leading to the war. This argument seems to imply that Germany is the instigator, but my response is that whether the policy of dominance in Europe should be pursued, and whether Britain should prevent it, are not for me to defend, let alone to take sides.</p>
<p>Before the previous Great War, there had been four crises. This time, it seems that there have not been so many crises. It is also interesting to compare the locations where the crises of the two European wars occurred. The crises of the previous European War, except for the third Balkan crisis that occurred in Europe, the other three did not occur in Europe. The points of contention were all on the opposite side of the Mediterranean Sea, in Africa in the colonies. This time, only Italy's annexation of Abyssinia was outside Europe. If we include it as a crisis, the crises before the previous European War were all clearly caused by the direct conflict of interests between the two main parties, such as the Franco-Italian dispute over Tunisia, the Franco-German dispute over Morocco, and the Austro-Serbian dispute over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The conflicting parties in the various crises that have occurred this time are not so simple. In the Abyssinian incident, Britain stirred up all the members of the League of Nations to oppose Italy. The Spanish Civil War, if it is also called a crisis, is even a recognized small-scale world war. Only the Sudetenland crisis last autumn was relatively similar, but the strength of Germany and Czechoslovakia differed greatly, which was still not as "evenly matched" as the two sides in the previous four crises. However, the Sudetenland dispute is still the best comparison with the Austro-Serbian dispute in the previous war. Serbia was weaker than Austria, and Russia, although it wanted to help it, feared Germany. As a result, it persuaded Serbia to compromise, and Austria, because Serbia had Russia behind it, temporarily satisfied with obtaining Bosnia-Herzegovina. Otherwise, given Austria's usual ambitions, it might not have had to wait until its crown prince was assassinated to take action against Serbia (of course, Germany's permission and assistance were even more important). What is different is that during the Sudetenland crisis, Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to buy temporary peace in Europe, and later lacked the determination to guarantee it, so Czechoslovakia eventually fell. In this Polish question, if Poland had yielded or Germany had retreated, it would have been very possible to temporarily turn it into a crisis without becoming the fuse of a great war. However, the so-called meaning of Poland's yielding is that Poland would have to sacrifice its exports and access to foreign trade. If it did not have Britain and France behind it, it might have been able to consider it. With Britain and France behind it, and Britain and France believing that they had reached the highest limit of tolerance and had to insist, then Hitler would naturally say that this war was caused by Britain giving Poland a blank check, encouraging it to be tough on Germany. If Germany did not have the stimulant of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, it might have been able to temporarily retreat a little, but that assumption still has many questions. If what Germany and the Soviet Union concluded was truly a military alliance as rumored outside, Germany could rely on it to offset the mutual assistance between Britain and France to Poland, and even fundamentally eliminate the courage of Britain and France to help Poland. What Germany has obtained now is only to use the Soviet Union's power to jointly destroy Poland so that it can fully deal with Britain and France. Since the Soviet Union has stated that it is still willing to maintain neutrality with Britain and France, whether friction will occur after direct contact between Germany and the Soviet Union is highly questionable. No wonder some people say that Hitler is "working for others," while Stalin is reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>However, Britain and France repeatedly stated that they would abide by their promise to aid Poland, and Hitler himself also assumed that Poland's toughness was caused by Britain's promise to provide assistance in various circumstances. If what he said was really what he thought in his mind, then he would not necessarily be completely mistaken in judging that Britain and France would not intervene in the war. Perhaps he was confident that he would win this war, but we cannot but understand the weaknesses and pains that a dictator cannot express himself. Although he can erase the observance and guarantee of international treaties at any time, a word to the domestic audience is always a word, not to mention that Germany has been sailing smoothly for several years, and the current setbacks would greatly violate its honor and shake the public's faith in the government. From this point of view, we can conclude that the outbreak of this war has its inevitability. Germany wanted to dominate Europe and pursued it, but Britain and France could not tolerate it and aided Poland to resist Germany. Within the first two or three days of the war, the general view was that after Germany achieved its goals in Poland, it would present a fait accompli to Britain and France and request peace talks. Now Britain, France, and Poland have mutually agreed not to make a separate peace, and the Soviet Union, although it has sent troops to divide Poland, Britain and France still claim that they will help Poland until its sovereign rights are fully restored. It can be seen that the possibility of a quick end to this war seems very small. Looking back to the beginning of this century, Austria followed Germany's lead in everything, so its development can be compared to Germany's own development. In addition to Germany's own ambitions, it ultimately could not be compatible with Britain's traditional policy, which led to the war. The events before and after are remotely opposite. Although the saying that history repeats itself is still debatable, it is not too much to say that the evolution of history has a fairly fixed law. In 1914, Germany, Britain, and France were the main actors, and they are still the main actors now, and they are still standing on the opposite sides as before. The direction of the two confrontations is also the same. Poland has replaced the position of Russia in the previous war. The previous war was launched by Austria and Germany, but now it is Germany. However, the direction of actual action is different. The attitude of Russia (Soviet Union) is the most important influence. In the previous war, the German General Staff initially adopted a western offensive policy, wanting to use lightning tactics to first subdue France, and then turn its troops to the east. Therefore, it violated Belgium's permanent neutrality and first launched an offensive on the western front. On the eastern front, it was because the internal affairs of Tsarist Russia were corrupt, and secret mobilization had exceeded two weeks, and it had already announced formal mobilization, but the troops had not yet been concentrated. Because it had nothing to fear from Russia, it only adopted a defensive posture, waiting for work at leisure. This time, Germany's goal was originally Poland, so it adopted the fierce offensive on the eastern border that was the western front in the previous war, while the western border relied on the Siegfried Line as the Great Wall, focusing on defense. In the previous war, Russia attacked East Prussia, but this time its replacement, Poland, was attacked by Germany and the Soviet Union. France was originally beaten, but this time it adopted a posture of hitting people (to be continued).</p>

<h3>Tzu Lien Hui Disposes of Children from Disaster-Stricken Educational Institutions</h3>
<p>The Joint Disaster Relief Association of Philanthropic Organizations has been handling the work of sheltering refugees and providing relief since the war. People from all walks of life in the city have highly praised it. Because of the difficulty in raising relief funds and the fact that the number of refugees has indeed decreased significantly compared to before, it has been decided to end the operation, giving those refugees who can support themselves funds to dismiss them. However, they are quite troubled by the educational affairs of the adults and refugee children that have been handled. After several consultations, it is reported that a decision has been made. Those who are truly unable to do so but have excellent academic performance will be recommended to transfer to various schools in the city. As for the No. 1 Middle School of the Tzu Yuan Shelter and the Refugee Children's Middle School, preparations are being made to hand them over to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association.</p>

<h3>Charity Tennis Exciting Program Xu Chengwei vs. Wang Wenzheng Wang Wenzheng Gives Up Handicap Semi-Finals Li Guofan Zhang Dingzhao to Decide Champion on Saturday</h3>
<p>The handicap tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Tennis Club, the semi-final of the men's singles Wang Wenzheng vs. Li Guofan, was originally scheduled to be played at the Shanghai Tennis Club at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday. It is learned that Mr. Wang gave up the final rights to Li Guofan in order to induce younger generations. Therefore, although Wang and Li went to the stadium on time the day before yesterday, they did not officially compete, but practiced doubles with Zhang Dingzhao and Liang Dexian. Therefore, Zhang Dingzhao will compete with Li Guofan for the championship in the men's singles final at 2:00 pm on September 30. The charity tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been extended to two consecutive days this weekend (i.e., September 30 and October 1), and ten box seats have been added in time to adjust the seats and increase revenue. It is now learned that the first box seat has been sold by Mr. Pan Zhiquan and Shi Zhaoji for 100 yuan in legal tender. Enthusiastic philanthropists will surely rise up in response. The original admission tickets issued for September 23 and 24 can be used for September 30 and 31.

Since Xu came to Shanghai, there has been only one official game, which was a 2-3 loss to Carson. This game was held at the Citibank General Assembly, and only one or two reporters were present. Many tennis players, because they have not seen Xu's true face of Mount Lu, are looking forward to it very much. Yesterday, at the suggestion of Mr. Shen Zhenchao of this newspaper, and urged by Mr. Chen Qihao, he has generously agreed to perform a singles match with Wang Wenzheng. Judging from their results against Carson, their strength is difficult to distinguish. Once they meet, it will be the most exciting performance of tennis players this season.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football League Opening Postponed Until October 7</h3>
<p>Hong Kong News. The Hong Kong Football Association held a meeting on the 12th at the Guangdong Bank on the fifth floor, and the resolution has been seen in the previous communication. The details are recorded below. The attendees included Huang Jiajun (representatives of Groups B and C), Yi Shishe Lanchi (Hong Kong Club), Jubei (Police), Binwu (Army), Guba (Navy), Holland Shi (Eastern), Chen Hanming (South China), Jianjin (St. Joseph), Gaodunbei (Honorary Secretary), Sousa (Deputy Honorary Secretary), and many others. Chairman Bi Laite was unable to attend due to business, and Huang Jiajun represented him. Regarding the opening of the Group A, B, and C leagues, which was originally scheduled for September 23 (Saturday), representatives of various associations successively expressed their opinions, all of which were that the league did not need to be suspended, but only that the game schedule be slightly delayed. The representatives of the Army and Navy also thought so. As a result, everyone agreed to postpone the league for two weeks and open it on October 7 (Saturday). The case was passed.</p>
<p>Double Tenth Festival Charity Match</p>
<p>The General Assembly resolved that a charity football match will be held on the National Day of October 10 for the Hong Kong Yingzhang Chinese Branch, with the Chinese League against the Hong Kong League at the Hong Kong Club Stadium. The Governor of Hong Kong will attend to watch the game. The players of the two teams will be selected by the Management Sub-Committee. The representative of the Hong Kong Club, according to the proposal of Yi Shidulan, said that for any charity competition held at the Hong Kong Club Stadium, the Hong Kong Club would rather sacrifice 10% of the ticket revenue to obtain 150 free admission tickets for members. As a result, all the committee members agreed to this matter.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-Port Competition</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-Port Competition was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai in November this year, and Hong Kong had already agreed to the request. Recently, the outbreak of the European war has raised this issue for discussion. According to Mr. Huang, "In view of the current situation, it is difficult to decide whether to go or not, because many members of the volunteer army of various associations cannot get away to Shanghai, and military personnel also feel the same difficulty. It is best to wait for a few weeks and listen to Shanghai's opinions before making a decision." Everyone agreed and passed. Regarding the issue of how much time should be added after the Hong Kong-Shanghai Inter-Port Competition ends in a draw, both sides held their own opinions. Hong Kong insisted that 20 minutes be added after the draw (10 minutes for changing fields), while Shanghai insisted that 30 minutes be added (15 minutes for changing fields). Recently, the General Assembly received a letter from Shanghai stating that the Shanghai General Assembly Committee members still insisted on the 15-minute proposal. If Hong Kong's final decision still maintains the original opinion, Shanghai can also accept it. As a result, the Hong Kong committee members passed the proposal to add 20 minutes after the game ended in a draw because the Shanghai side had made concessions.</p>

<p>Harboring Selling Pressure, Foreign Exchange Reverses and Loosens, Sassoon Sells British Gold, Buys American Currency</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices showed a half-yuan increase for the Japanese yen, reaching 26.5 yuan, and a 0.25 increase for the Dutch guilder, totaling 11.25 yuan. Other currencies, such as British and American, remained stable. The grey market for British and American currencies had dissipated due to the disappearance of various rumors, which gradually stabilized market sentiment and led to a slight easing of market conditions. However, the morning's opening was slightly soft due to weak sales from non-professional traders. British gold was quoted at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence, and the US dollar at 6.875 yuan. But soon, Shanghai Chinese yarn and cotton merchants, along with Hong Kong Electric, suddenly exerted selling pressure, and the buying interest of a certain bank also improved. As a result, the situation immediately reversed and eased. In the afternoon, further selling pressure came from Hong Kong via telegrams. Although Western merchant Sassoon absorbed some US dollars, the position still felt ample. British gold once traded above 4 shillings 2.8125 pence, and the US dollar also eased to 7.09375 yuan. Chinese merchants suddenly seized the opportunity to switch from selling to buying at low prices, and Sassoon also absorbed US dollars. Therefore, the closing price for British gold was 4 shillings 2.5 pence, and the US dollar at 7.0625 yuan. Compared to last weekend, British gold eased by 0.078125 and the US dollar strengthened by 0.15625. The trend for September and October futures was similar to the spot market. Midway, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly sold British currency and bought US currency at an exchange rate of 3.9761 yuan. Furthermore, American bank Chase Manhattan entered with larger sell orders and exited with smaller buy orders, conducting US dollar swaps with Chinese merchants, with a discount of 0.09375 US dollars, resulting in a monthly interest rate of about 1.35%.</p>
<p>Dutch and Japanese Exchange Rates Lengthen</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, there were no telegrams from London with the prices from major firms or Bank of America. London's raw gold remained fixed. Exchange rates for British vs. American and British vs. French remained stable, while British vs. Shanghai decreased by 0.125. American vs. British fell by 0.25, American vs. Shanghai decreased by 0.05, and American vs. French decreased by a small amount of 0.025. The Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 4 shillings 1.5625 pence for British gold and 6.875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to last Saturday, British gold was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was slightly softer by 0.03125. After opening, Western merchant Sassoon sold spot British gold to non-professional traders at 4 shillings 1.875 pence, a stable condition. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, Dutch and Japanese currencies lengthened, while the rest remained stable. When the silver equalization tax was announced, there were no increases or decreases. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly entered spot US dollars at 6.9375 yuan, with an exchange rate of 3.9761 yuan. Later, Chinese yarn and cotton merchants, along with Hong Kong Electric, successively sold spot British gold to non-professional traders such as Chase Manhattan at 4 shillings 1.875 and 2.1875 pence, and spot US dollars at 6.9375 and 7.0625 yuan. At this time, the hardest British gold was traded at over 4 shillings 2.5 pence, so the underlying trend slightly eased. Approaching noon, there were slight September and October swap transactions. Chase Manhattan discounted US dollars by 0.09375 to Chinese merchants for arbitrage, which was about 1.35% monthly interest. Extending to the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings 2.1875 pence for British gold and 7 yuan for the US dollar, compared to the morning opening, British gold eased by 0.0625 and the US dollar hardened by 0.125.</p>
<p>Spot US Dollar Re-emerges at 7 Yuan</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Hong Kong Electric resold spot Central gold to non-professional traders at 4 shillings 2.5 pence, and sold spot US dollars to non-professional traders such as Sassoon and Chinese merchants at 7.0625 and 7.09375 yuan. At this time, the hardest British gold traded above 4 shillings 2.8125 pence. Later, a Chinese merchant sold October US dollars to a certain bank at 7 yuan. The process remained slightly firm. Extending to the late close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings 2.5 pence for British gold and 7.0625 yuan for the US dollar. This month's prices were the same as the above prices. October British gold was quoted at 4 shillings 2.03125 pence, and the US dollar at 6.9375 yuan. As a result, compared to last weekend, spot British gold eased by 0.078125, and the US dollar strengthened by 0.15625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British and American Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th: Today's foreign exchange market opened steadily. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. Shanghai exchange rate slightly decreased by 2 yuan to 350 yuan. At 11:30 AM, Shanghai exchange rate rose by 4 yuan to 354 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged.

<h3>Gold Market Initially Rises Then Slightly Weakens, Revolving Around 4,100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold grey market conditions initially rose then weakened, with the trend revolving around 4,100 yuan. The various false rumors from the past week began to subside today. However, the final result was a slight downward trend due to the easing of foreign exchange. The opening was encouraged by the slightly tight foreign exchange, reaching a high of 4,120 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling from silversmiths, the price immediately returned to a low of 4,100 yuan. However, soon a Hong Kong group suddenly created a buying trend, forcefully purchasing over 300 taels, and securities firms also frequently absorbed gold, causing the market outlook to strengthen. The price rose to a high of 4,168 yuan. Subsequently, due to the easing of foreign exchange, silversmiths and gold firms competed to aggressively sell, and the securities firms also reversed their position to sell, leading to an unsustainable situation. The price plummeted to 4,080 yuan. At noon, the condition slightly stabilized, closing at 4,115 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial condition was still stable. Subsequently, due to the continued slight easing of foreign exchange, retail appetite suddenly waned. In addition, a certain gold firm tended to sell on behalf of speculators. Although the Hong Kong group still had some buying appetite, the position still felt oversupplied. The price once fell to a low of 4,064 yuan. Later, retail investors took advantage of the low prices to raise the market, and the price rebounded to close at 4,085 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to last weekend's noon close. Trading was still active throughout the day, with over 1,500 taels traded. Silversmith jewelry gold also fluctuated, ultimately remaining unchanged. Customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Small Silver Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar (ten taels), initially opened with news of slightly soft foreign exchange, the situation was stable. Gold firms initially sold ten taels to money exchange businesses for 4,120 yuan, 15 yuan higher than last weekend's noon close. After opening, due to silversmith selling pressure, the price immediately fell back 20 yuan. Silversmiths sold thirty taels to money exchange businesses for 4,100 yuan. Afterwards, the appetite of a certain money exchange business improved (absorbing on behalf of the Hong Kong group), and sellers became fewer, immediately raising the price by 40 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought ten taels from a fellow firm and a cash firm, each at a price of 4,140 yuan. At this time, because the foreign exchange slightly turned from soft to hard, the sellers were slightly more active, and the price once retreated to 4,115 yuan. However, soon the Hong Kong group revived the buying trend, and the securities firms also tracked and absorbed purchases, causing the market to trend upwards again, soaring by 53 yuan. Securities firms bought twenty taels from money exchange businesses for 4,168 yuan. Subsequently, the Hong Kong group and others stopped buying to observe, and because foreign exchange continued to harden, the securities firms also reversed their position to sell. Silversmiths and a certain gold firm also sold quite forcefully, and the market outlook became unsustainable, soon plummeting by 88 yuan. Cash firms sold ten taels to money exchange businesses for 4,080 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange stabilized, the selling trend of silversmiths and a certain gold firm slightly subsided, so general retail investors took advantage of the low prices to absorb purchases, recovering 50 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought twenty taels from securities firms for 4,130 yuan. Approaching noon, the price fell again. Money exchange businesses traded 30 taels among themselves for 4,115 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon market initially opened flat. Money exchange businesses bought ten taels from silversmiths, still at 4,115 yuan. Subsequently, because foreign exchange carried hardness, a certain gold firm frequently sold, and at the same time silversmiths also still had a selling appetite, immediately weakening the price by 20 yuan. Silversmiths sold ten taels to gold firms for 4,095 yuan. At this time, another Yu firm absorbed on behalf of the Hong Kong group, and securities firms also slightly improved their appetite, so the price recovered by 10 yuan. Securities firms bought twenty taels from money exchange businesses for 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm's selling trend became increasingly strong, forcefully selling on behalf of speculators. In addition, there were few buyers, and the price actually collapsed by 41 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded ten taels among themselves for 4,064 yuan. Later, the selling trend slightly subsided, and gold firms and money exchange businesses took advantage of the low prices to absorb purchases, so the price slightly rebounded. Gold firms bought ten taels from money exchange businesses for 4,085 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price decreased by 20 yuan compared to last weekend's noon close. It was heard that after closing, silversmiths and money exchange businesses in the field traded 30 taels among themselves, with prices all the same as the evening closing price. Later, money exchanges bought ten taels from silversmiths, with a price of 4,090 yuan. The selling price of cash firm's original brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was 50 yuan lower than the selling price. The current standard gold was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Balanced</p>
<p>Silversmith jewelry gold was exchanged for resale at a price of 415 yuan per tael at the beginning by Da Tong Hang. Until 9:40, the price increased by 5 yuan. At 10:30, the price fell back by 5 yuan. At 3:00 PM, the price decreased by 5 yuan. At 4:00 PM, the price recovered by 5 yuan. In the end, there was no change. It was calculated that both Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang were still suspended at 415 yuan, with the purchase price decreased by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>British and American Treasury Notes Are Actively Demanded and Rise Exclusively</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market trend turned soft. After the foreign exchange market was repeatedly sold off by Hong Kong telegrams, the market was quite hard, resulting in American gold notes initially rising slightly in the morning, then immediately falling back to 14.35 yuan. The result was a fall of 0.3 yuan. British gold notes also fell by 0.6 yuan, Hong Kong notes decreased by 0.02 yuan, Annam notes fell by 0.35 yuan, Robi notes decreased by 0.2 yuan, Korean notes decreased by 0.005 yuan. The trend for Japanese gold notes was still strong, and the final price was still 1.345 yuan. British and American treasury notes were in high demand, so they continued to rise uniformly by 1 yuan. Otherwise, there were no changes.</p>
<h3>Discount Steps Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills suddenly fell again, presenting a trend of stepping down without returning. Initially, each thousand yuan was still around 90 yuan, then gradually stepped down until noon at 85 yuan. In the afternoon, it further dropped by 10 yuan, and finally 75 yuan, which was 15 yuan lower than the previous six. The interest rate for the Qianye Association remained unchanged, opening at 0.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Domestic Debt Trading Quiet, 25th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Lottery Held in Chongqing</p>
<p>Public debt grey market trading was no longer as exciting as in the previous few days. Large bullish investors were still waiting for the right time to move. Yesterday's buying and selling saw very few large investors entering or exiting. Those seeking to sell could not obtain the desired price, so they also returned disappointed. Those making up for purchases could easily obtain the goods. Trading all belonged to scattered retail investors. Afternoon trading was initially good then weakened, smaller than in the morning. The market price result was slightly lower by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. The 96 issue reversed to become better by 0.1 yuan. The number of transactions was around 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 53.05 52.30 52.70 Down 0.35</p>
<p>Unified B 46.15 45.75 45.80 Down 0.30</p>
<p>Unified C 45.70 45.15 45.50 Down 0.30</p>
<p>Unified D 44.00 …… 44.00 Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified E 44.80 44.30 44.60 Down 0.15</p>
<p>96 5.75 …… 5.75 Up 0.10</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 50 shares of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange traded at a price of 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Public Association reported that yesterday's market conditions were calm. Rubber stocks were quite quiet. Steel stocks were very active, with fluctuating prices slightly lower than the previous day's peak. Wheelock stock was in good demand and was beaten to 37.25 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Mill also dramatically rose, with a price of 150 yuan still not satisfying the buyer's desires. Otherwise, there was little to report.</p>
<p>The seventh lottery for the 25th year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Debt was held in Chongqing on the 15th of this month. The numbers 20 and 51 were drawn, totaling a principal of 300,000 yuan. Together with the seventh期 interest coupons, they are scheduled to be paid out by the Chongqing Central China Communications Bank starting on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Industry Stockpiling, Cotton Prices Expected to Rise</p>
<p>The trading of native cotton white packages was still fairly weak. Factory Shenxin and other factories had slightly improved appetite, but the amount consumed was not expanded. Japanese merchants were also in a wait-and-see attitude. Industry sentiment was firm. Although the current source of Tongzhou cotton was still actively arriving, difficulties had occurred in the Huangpu River. Generally, people were worried about future risks. Therefore, a certain cotton firm's intention suddenly changed course. For goods with excellent quality, the opening price was 150 yuan, which was 7 yuan higher than the previous day. It exclusively consumed several thousand packages, flocking to the stacks to stockpile and wait for prices to rise. Cotton prices with slightly inferior quality and moist cotton were still stable. Over 3,200 packages of Tong cotton continued to arrive from Subei, 800-900 packages from Changyinsha, and 1,500 packages from Beisha. The current cotton opening price list is on the left.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton trading in Shanghai yesterday did not have much change. However, the inventory in Shanghai was not high, so the cotton price reversed to be high. The willingness of industry members to sell was very loose, and they were temporarily unwilling to sell. Currently, raw materials above 32 counts were very rare in the market. Industry members had a small amount of spot goods, but they were not planning to sell them. Factories had a very strong need for this type of cotton, and it was very difficult to purchase. Yesterday, the market price for American species new special cotton that could spin 20 counts was over 190 yuan, and the White Rock price was 172 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was relatively calm yesterday. Because exporters were not active, the market was unusually stagnant. Later, because some bulls settled and industry members slightly sold off, the result was a closing price that fell by 6-7 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell 6 rupees including forecasts. The Egyptian Liverpool market was closed.</p>
<h3>Coarse Yarn Sales Are Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still firm, but the rising trend feels more gradual. In fact, part of the psychology is that its bottom has already been high, and the amount of funds has been reduced. Therefore, the rising power of upper-body yarn prices is gentle. However, the prices of medium-count yarns are relatively cheap, so they are slowly rising. For the 10-count coarse yarn of the guest group and Hong Kong group, sales are smooth. Because the price distance from 20-count yarn is too far, and it is also the peak season, market transactions have greatly increased. The profits of factories are not as thick as fine yarns, and they are relatively thin.</p>
<p>The opening sentiment for current yarn in the morning was still tight. Because raw cotton arriving in Shanghai had difficulties in the Huangpu River, people were optimistic. The opening price immediately rose by 10 yuan. The single price for 20-count Double Horse stack was 750 yuan, and the spot price was 800 yuan. There was a slight fluctuation in the middle, but the 10-count coarse yarn saw a healthier appetite from the guest group, and the market condition was indeed rising. By the time of closing, the momentum was slightly flat and tired. The amount of transactions was 1,255 packages in half a day. The market quotations for 20-count Double Horse rose by 15 yuan, Tiannv rose by 10 yuan, Muyang rose by 9 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 5 to 10 yuan. The amount of purchases from each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 600 Fellow Firms 560</p>
<p>Mainland 95 Total 1,255</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten by 1-2 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to tighten. The association's listed prices were: 24 raw white spot goods 56-56.2 yuan for outside stacks, 55.5 yuan for local stacks, 42 yuan for transit goods, Taikoo sugar from B mark West stack 60.07 yuan, East stack 60.05 yuan, CW 60 yuan, CX 59 yuan, DY 58.2 yuan, HX mark West stack 58 yuan, East stack 57.5 yuan, H car red 44.5 yuan, Dutch red 45.5 yuan, transit goods 37.5 yuan, local factory No. 1 white 56 yuan, No. 2 55.5 yuan, local factory ice 67.5 yuan, Jingming ice 69 yuan, all increased by 1-2 yuan compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Difficult to Lower for a While</p>
<p>Du Geng: Yesterday, there was no arrival of goods from Hebei for each group. The new goods from Che Lun, Baozi, Kunshan, Jiading, and other areas were only 3,000-4,000 packages. Therefore, the opening market was in good spirits, and there was a desire to shout high prices. Afterwards, the local street shops acted because the market was closed yesterday, which suddenly tightened the situation. The prices of goods rose all the way. If Gengjian all increased by about 1 yuan. By the evening market, the purchasing of the local street suddenly relaxed, and the Autumn Festival was approaching. Therefore, after a movement, the condition was tired. As a result, the market quotation of new goods and new sharp declined by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. It was calculated that special Chang Geng was 39 yuan, the market price was 35 yuan, special Xi Geng was 38 yuan, high goods were 36 yuan, middle goods were 34 yuan, Su Tong Kun Geng were 33-34 yuan, and Kun Zhuan Zhoupu and other new Geng were 26-27 yuan. Hebei early and late rice were absent due to lack of goods.

The number of transactions was over 6,000 packages in the total market.</p>
<p>Guest Xian: In recent days, the arrival of goods from Jiangbei has been blocked by a certain party. Road transport inland has also been blocked. In order to prepare for the week holiday and the Autumn Festival break, the sellers were all maximizing their purchase, and once raised by more than a yuan in the morning. Following that, a Japanese sold the entire batch of goods at once with the price being at 22, 23, and 24 yuan for the goods of high, medium, and low quality respectively. The sellers all turned to look at the prices, so the market prices fell back by 0.5 yuan. The result was only about 0.5-0.6 yuan higher in price. The high Guest Xian was 25.2-25.3 yuan to 24.8 yuan, and the final market price was 24.5 to 23 yuan.</p>

So it is difficult for the market to be good. Fuxin factory bought from local markets, and other places from Suzhou and Taicang a total of 4000+ bags of wheat. Stacking households pulled up 4-5 carts. The highest price was at 10.02 yuan. The market price increased from a few minutes to a yuan from what was before.</p>

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Essential Knowledge for Youth: Health Can Promote the Growth of Love</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of a Medical University in Russia</p>
<p>What is the treasure of a healthy family? It's simply remembering the slogan "unity of spirit and flesh." The establishment of a family requires maintenance through both "spirit" and "flesh." Eating and sexual desire are natural, indicating that the relationship between husband and wife cannot be encompassed by the pure meaning of "spirit." Facts tell us that indulgence can harm the body, so pure materialism cannot maintain a marital relationship forever. In short, emphasizing one aspect is the most erroneous concept.</p>
<p>Unity of spirit and flesh is the key to building a happy home, something we should absolutely trust. So, how do we allocate it evenly? How do we practice it reasonably? A simple concept should be introduced to readers. Unsatisfied reproductive needs often lead to "estrangement," and may even tempt one party down an immoral path. Therefore, we must ensure the health of our reproductive functions. On the one hand, we must not indulge in self-harm, thus avoiding kidney deficiency. At the very least, this provides strong insurance against emotional breakdown. In daily interactions, both parties have a duty to support the development of affection. In short, both "spirit" and "flesh" should be allocated evenly, and their separate exercise should adhere to the two major principles of "propriety" and "moderation."</p>
<p>When the emotions between husband and wife are strong, the atmosphere of the family becomes harmonious and warm. However, if the body is not cultivated, love cannot grow. Therefore, health can promote the growth of the sapling of love, a point we deeply hope readers will pay attention to.</p>
<p>Indulgence is enough to harm the body. Excessive intercourse, especially for men, can lead to spinal cord symptoms, weakened lower limbs, mental decline, spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation, and even incomplete development. Youth is like vibrant grass; if afflicted with the above ailments, wouldn't they lose their precious future entirely?</p>
<p>For the sake of love's future, such diseases must be treated quickly. German Jürgens' testicular extract preparation for men, "Panteston," is the leader among modern endocrine agents. Three doses a day effectively nourish the brain, blood, and essence. It is most suitable for nervous weakness, pale complexion, kidney deficiency, infertility, and premature aging. I have used it in clinical practice for seven years and have never encountered a case where it was ineffective, so I dare to introduce it to patients. The female "Panteston" is an ovarian endocrine preparation with the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting conception.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Leucorrhea Can Absolutely Be Cured Radically</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Is it really impossible to cure gonorrhea using scientific methods? In fact, it is not. Gonorrhea can be conquered with scientific methods. However, the method of treatment must be thorough and scientific, which depends entirely on the doctor's experience. If one can maintain health and heed the doctor's instructions, then those afflicted with gonorrhea can be cured. One must deliberate deeply and thoughtfully during treatment to avoid failure. However, I often see general gonorrhea patients eager for a cure. Because the disease cannot be cured immediately, they inevitably reveal anxiety. And the general over-the-counter medicines and doctors on the market cater to this, claiming that using such-and-such medicine or such-and-such treatment can completely cure the disease within two or three days. The result, however, is that they still cannot escape the pain of gonorrhea after three or four months, and they become more and more trapped in a state of confusing gonorrhea symptoms, which is irreparable. Therefore, it is necessary to use targeted therapy to completely eliminate the gonococcus because only by completely and fundamentally eradicating gonorrhea can one avoid adverse prognoses.</p>
<p>According to the analysis and testing of new drugs by doctors in various countries each year, the only drug worthy of being called a special medicine is "Kliron," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, which is sufficient to surpass any oral gonorrhea medication in the world. Because its bactericidal power permeates all the cells of the body, no matter where the gonococcus flees, it cannot escape the bactericidal circle of "Kliron." For gonorrheal prostatitis, cystitis, pyelonephritis, orchitis, urethral stricture, etc., taking "Kliron" can absolutely cure them, because the scope of its bactericidal power is not on the surface or in a local area, but directly eliminates the gonococcus at the site of the lesion. As for external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Solution," and women can use "Carder Sheath Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, so that internal and external routes are used to eliminate the gonococcus, and the cure is even faster.</p>
<h3>The Seriousness of Coughing</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing is a symptom that is most easily overlooked. The reason is that those who cough do not have any immediately dangerous or terrifying symptoms, so they keep delaying treatment, and the cough becomes more and more severe, leading to an incurable state.</p>
<p>From a truly pathological point of view, coughing is a way for the lungs to expel harmful substances that have invaded from the outside world, and it is a form of resistance and defense. Using anesthetics actually reduces resistance. Based on my experience of more than 20 years and referring to experimental reports from doctors in various countries, the lung disease-specific medicine "Pulmonal," invented by Dr. Thome of Germany, is the most effective. No matter how stubborn and difficult to cure or how close to consumption a cough is, taking "Pulmonal" can relieve coughing and dissolve phlegm within three hours. Its effect of strengthening the lungs and preventing consumption is far above that of cod liver oil. This has been proven by doctors in various countries. —Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Health Tips</p>
<h3>The Depth of Harm from Masturbation for Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Everyone knows that male masturbation can cause pathological changes in the spinal cord and brain nerves, so after prolonged indulgence, nervous weakness, back pain, and spermatorrhea occur, and the harm is endless. However, in women, there are also various harms, but compared with men, they are not as severe. According to expert surveys, female masturbation is not as common as male masturbation. The physiological harm suffered by those who engage in it is far less than the psychological harm. Because once a woman engages in masturbation, her beautiful virtues of chastity and tranquility are completely lost. Therefore, women who masturbate easily fall, and are mostly candidates for future prostitutes and adulteresses. But after prolonged indulgence, it can cause inflammation of the sexual organs, menstrual disorders, and frigidity. From a hygienic point of view, masturbation has hundreds of harms and not a single benefit. Young men should abstain from it. If you feel that your body is deficient, take the testicular essence preparation for men, "Panteston," at any time to restore the damage caused by masturbation. At the same time, take "Night-Eze Emission Pills" to stop spermatorrhea. For women, they can take female "Panteston" to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Musings</p>
<h3>Special Treatment for Gonorrheal Cystitis</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrheal cystitis occurs when a patient with acute or chronic gonorrhea undergoes poor local irrigation, or when engaging in intercourse while holding urine during chronic gonorrhea. All of these can cause the gonococcus to invade the internal bladder. Patients experience lower abdominal pain, frequent urination, cloudy urine, and even blood in the urine. If this continues day after day, the disease will become more severe. If treatment is not sought early, the original bacteria of gonorrhea will further invade the kidneys, resulting in gonorrheal pyelonephritis. This is a very serious condition, and treatment must be prompt. Because the spread of gonorrhea is increasingly prevalent, a variety of complications can arise. However, we must be careful about these treatments. If we use general local treatment or transmucosal bactericidal treatment again, it will not help and we will only make one mistake after another. We should be very careful.</p>
<p>In short, gonorrheal cystitis should be treated as soon as possible. My treatment for gonorrheal cystitis begins with a scientific examination to determine the location of the lesion. After diagnosing the location of the lesion, I use the gonorrhea-specific medicine "Kliron," as well as German electrostatic therapy and X-ray therapy, to work together. In this way, cystitis during acute gonorrhea can be cured in two weeks. If it has become chronic cystitis, then three or four weeks will absolutely cure it. I have 20 years of experience in the treatment of gonorrhea. Whether I prescribe oral medicine, apply surgery, or use electrotherapy, I can treat it according to the symptoms, and I can achieve the desired effect quickly. After the above treatment methods, the symptoms of gonorrheal cystitis can be quickly reduced and even completely cured in a short period of time, and there are absolutely no cases of failure. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, we will provide consultations for 20 patients each day. Each consultation will cost only 50 cents, and we will give away a copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one dollar.</p>

<h3>Sham Police Actions Rampant: American Sailor Suddenly Detained, Held for Two Hours Before Release, US Forbids Officers and Soldiers from Going to Roads Outside the Boundary, Unwilling to Negotiate This Case with the Spurious Side</h3>
<p>After the spurious police invaded the roads built beyond the boundary in West Shanghai and ran amok, causing trouble repeatedly, a public bus driver was kidnapped by thugs in Caojiadu the day before. That same evening, an American marine was detained by the spurious police for two hours. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department instructed the local police station to take stricter precautions in the important areas of the roads built beyond the boundary, causing the situation in West Shanghai to become tense again. Detailed reports are as follows:</p>
<p>Minor Incident Leads to Detention</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, an American Marine from the Fourth Regiment was detained by "Avenue" police in West Shanghai at 9:00 PM last night (the 24th) for a few hours, and was not released until 10:55 PM. The incident occurred in front of the Wellcome Café near Zhaofeng. As of late last night, the details were still unknown, but it is known that the American soldier had an argument with someone. The café's hired usher blew a whistle, and twenty "Avenue" police officers went to the scene upon hearing the sound. They then got into a struggle with the American soldier. The American soldier was outnumbered and overpowered, and was put on a truck and driven to the "Avenue" police station on Jessfield Road.</p>
<p>Released After Two Hours</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department and the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marines were immediately notified and began discussing the release of the soldier. After several hours of discussion, the American soldier was released. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps authorities feared that such incidents would continue to occur, so they immediately prohibited Marine soldiers and sailors from going to the Yu Garden Road area, and dispatched patrols throughout the area, ordering all sailors and Marine soldiers to leave. As a result, after 1:00 AM, the taverns and bars and apple game stores near Zhaofeng Park on Yu Garden Road had very few customers.</p>
<p>U.S. Orders Ban on Officers and Soldiers from Visiting</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, an American Marine was detained by "Avenue" police on Yu Garden Road last night. This morning (the 25th), a senior U.S. Navy officer told reporters that officers and soldiers of the Fourth U.S. Marine Regiment are now prohibited from going to the entire road area beyond the boundary in West Shanghai. This order was issued by Colonel Fagan, commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment, today and will remain in effect until further notice.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Conduct Investigation or Negotiation</p>
<p>Regarding this accidental incident, this morning, Lieutenant Colonel Murray, Executive Officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, stated that the Marine Corps is taking "routine actions" with regard to the Marine soldier involved in the incident. The U.S. Marine Corps does not intend to conduct any investigation or negotiations with other parties regarding this matter. After the accidental incident occurred, U.S. military patrols arrived in the Yu Garden Road area and ordered U.S. soldiers, including sailors of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, to leave the area. The order was carried out in an orderly manner without hindering the civilian customers of the taverns in the area.</p>
<p>Dispatch Teams to Investigate and Block Re-entry to the Area</p>
<p>There are also U.S. Marine patrols stationed near the Paramount Ballroom at the corner of Yu Garden Road and Jessfield Road, intercepting all vehicles heading to Yu Garden Road, aiming to prevent soldiers of the Fourth Marine Regiment from entering the area. Within half an hour after the accidental incident occurred, teams of three or four "Avenue" police officers patrolled every 400 yards on Yu Garden Road.</p>
<p>Police Department Has Increased Security</p>
<p>This morning, the Public Concession Police Department increased security on Yu Garden Road and other roads beyond the boundary. According to those who drove along the roads beyond the boundary, although the Public Concession police allowed the cars to pass without obstruction, the "Avenue" police stationed a few yards away from the Concession police would order the cars to stop and carefully inspect the cars before allowing them to continue driving. It is heard that the Police Department has received special instructions regarding its duties in the area beyond the boundary. However, the Municipal Council authorities were unwilling to disclose any new steps currently being taken in the area this morning.</p>
<p>Security Concerns on Roads Built Beyond the Boundary</p>
<p>The Caojiadu area has been outwardly calm recently, but a public bus driver was kidnapped there at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Police and spurious police officers witnessed the incident, but most did not intervene. Security is a concern. Yesterday, at (1) Jessfield Road and Connaught Road, (2) Connaught Road and Singapore Road, and (3) Jessfield Road and the branch road of Brenan Road, traffic was entirely directed by spurious police. Concession police retreated to the sidewalks to keep watch. At the remaining stations such as (1) Jessfield Road and Robison Road, and (2) the intersection of the branch road of Brenan Road, spurious police and Concession police were still stationed, maintaining the original double-station state.</p>
<p>Situation Eases Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>At the intersection of Jessfield Road, Edinburgh Road, and Haig Road, the police station originally sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to guard the area, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Yesterday afternoon, there were only four Chinese detectives patrolling on the sidewalks, and the situation seemed to have eased. Traffic at the Qiu Garden front and the intersection of Connaught Road was entirely managed by spurious police. However, there were more spurious police stationed in front of Qiu Garden, a total of eight. The situation from Kangjia Bridge to Malu Bridge remained the same as before, with no changes seen. There were six spurious police officers each stationed at the intersections of Yu Garden Road and Jing'an Temple Road, on the sidewalks at each corner. Traffic was also managed by spurious police. The original eight stationed police officers had been reduced to four, and the situation was not as tense as before. The two spurious police officers stationed at the entrance of the Meiliyuan Lane on Great West Road had not retreated. The number of trucks carrying spurious police on Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road had decreased significantly yesterday.</p>
<p>Police Station Takes Strict Precautions</p>
<p>The situation at the intersection of Haig Road and Edinburgh Road has been more tense than other places since the spurious police stationed there on the 17th. The police station has taken very strict precautions. However, there were only six detectives stationed there yesterday, and the armored vehicle had also been moved to another location. The fortress built by the Japanese and spurious side in front of the No. 448 Lin's Mansion is still under construction. The number of spurious police defending it had been reduced from the original dozen or so to six yesterday. From Difeng Road to Fahua Town, armed spurious police are still patrolling in formation from time to time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Oppose the Electricity Company's Price Increase, Have Appealed to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News yesterday (the 24th), the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Road Federation met on Saturday and Sunday nights and unanimously opposed the Shanghai Power Company's proposed 120% fee increase. The committee has recently appealed to the Municipal Council, protesting the Bureau's approval of the power company's continued fee increase. They will take concrete action after receiving a response from the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Suggest Establishing a Price Evaluation Committee to Trade Associations, But in Fact There May Be Difficulties, Hoping the Authorities Will Suppress Hoarding and Manipulation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously issued a notice to the competent authorities in various places, together with the local relevant chambers of commerce and trade associations engaged in daily necessities, to establish price stabilization committees to handle the price stabilization of local daily necessities in order to suppress investment manipulation and stabilize the prices of daily necessities in various places. Now, various provinces, cities, and counties in non-occupied areas have successively established price stabilization committees as ordered. As a result, prices in various places have stabilized, and there has been no speculation or manipulation. As for Shanghai, due to the harsh environment and special circumstances, various speculators hoard goods because the government's power does not reach them, resulting in soaring prices.</p>
<p>Capitalists Hoard on a Large Scale</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, general asset holders have been hoarding goods, especially daily necessities such as food, fuel, oil, and sugar. The soaring prices are unprecedented, and the prices are not uniform, which is very distorted. The livelihoods of citizens are greatly affected, and legitimate merchants have difficulty trading. It is heard that various trade associations have suggested to the trade associations,</p>
<p>Suggest Following Government Regulations</p>
<p>Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to work with the Concession authorities to establish a Shanghai Commodity Price Evaluation Committee, limited to daily necessities. The method should be based on the government's promulgated measures for price evaluation and suppression of speculative manipulation during extraordinary periods. However, after considering the establishment of the Price Evaluation Committee, the various industry associations,</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the Facts are Difficult</p>
<p>Believe that there may be difficulties in Shanghai in fact. However, it is hoped that the Concession authorities will investigate and deal with those who speculate, hoard, and manipulate daily necessities on the market, in order to maintain security and avoid affecting the livelihoods of citizens.</p>
<h3>Various Debts Due at the End of September: Principal and Interest Paid on Time, Gold Bond Discounted by the Four Banks, Suspension of Payment for the Telecommunications Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has always maintained its creditworthiness. Domestic bonds are regularly drawn for repayment of principal and payment of interest. Before the principal and interest are due, they are allocated from the designated collateral items and handed over to the banks that pay the principal and interest for payment. There have never been any delays, which has gained the trust of bondholders. According to inquiries from the banking community yesterday, the public bonds with principal and interest due on September 30 include: (1) The Long-Term Financial Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 17, issued in November of Year 17, with a fixed amount of 45 million yuan. This is the twelfth repayment of principal, amounting to 1.125 million yuan. Because it is collateralized by customs revenue, after the government was forced to suspend payment of principal and interest, the National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China to change the payment method to discounting by the four banks. In Shanghai, it is paid in six installments to the Hui Gong; (2) The Consolidated Guangdong Financial Public Bonds, issued in October of the Republic of China Year 25, with a fixed amount of 120 million yuan. This is the sixth repayment of principal, amounting to 2.4 million yuan; (3) The Guangdong-Hong Kong River Dredging US Dollar Public Bonds, issued in April of the Republic of China Year 26, with a fixed amount of 2 million US dollars. This is the fifth repayment of principal, amounting to 40,000 US dollars. The principal and interest of the above two types of public bonds due will be paid on time by the Central Bank and other payment agencies; (3) The Telecommunications Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 24, issued in October of the Republic of China Year 24, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan. This is the sixteenth repayment of principal, amounting to 400,000 yuan. Its competent authority is the Ministry of Transportation, and its collateral is the revenue from international telegraphic fees. Now, because the revenue from international telegraphic fees has been stolen, payment of principal and interest has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Erected Boundary Markers in Section A North of the Suzhou Creek, Marked with Chinese and English to Indicate the Security Boundary Line, Four Places Erected Within Section A, Forcing Residents to Get Vaccinations Again These Days</h3>
<p>In Section A, north of the Suzhou Creek, which encompasses the area from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, after the British and Japanese defense lines were changed, the Japanese army has erected a boundary line on the east side of North Henan Road. The work of compulsory vaccination is also continuing. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Erect Boundary Markers on North Henan Road</p>
<p>Since taking over the area between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road, in addition to the Japanese soldiers stationed at the west entrance of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, there have been no other changes. However, at 1:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese military vehicle suddenly drove to the entrance of North Henan Road, carrying more than a dozen Japanese soldiers, who erected white signs with red characters bearing the words "British-Japanese Security Area Boundary Line" in Chinese and English at various intersections on the east side of the road.</p>
<p>Four Intersections Have Been Set Up</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted yesterday evening, the locations where the above-mentioned boundary signs were erected include: (1) the northern boundary of the Tianhou Temple Bridge on North Suzhou Road; (2) in front of the Sanmin Hospital on Tiantong Road; (3) on the side of Zhang Shunxin Sauce Surround on Qipu Road; and (4) the southern end of the small vegetable field at the intersection of Wenjianshi Road. Signs have not yet been erected at the intersection of Haining Road and Old Bazih Road.</p>
<p>Compulsory Injections Continued Yesterday</p>
<p>Under the canvas tent erected by the Japanese army on the side of the Shanghai Telephone Company at the west entrance of North Jiangxi Road on Haining Road, local residents continued to be forced to receive vaccinations and issue vaccination certificates yesterday. The vaccination date has been limited to the end of this month. Those who do not have a vaccination certificate after the deadline will lose their residential qualifications in the area.</p>
<p>Vaccination Deadline is the End of the Month</p>
<p>Because local residents are subject to the above coercion, the tent is crowded with people waiting for injections, and order is easily disrupted. Starting the day before yesterday, two Japanese soldiers were dispatched by the Japanese side to suppress the crowds. Yesterday, two "Avenue Police" were added. One of the Japanese soldiers also held a rattan whip and waved it at any time to drive away idlers watching nearby.</p>
<p>Defense of North Henan Road Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The former British military garrison at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazih Road and the Railway Hospital at the west end of the road have not been occupied by the Japanese army. At the iron gate at the end of North Henan Road, in addition to the British soldiers still guarding the post, British soldiers are also stationed in the bunker on the right side. At the entrance of Qianjiang Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, there is a barbed wire frame, and a British soldier is stationed there. As for the situation on the roads between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road, everything is as usual.</p>
<h3>British Airways Opens New Route: Southampton to New York</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1575 the day before yesterday, stating: It has been notified in this Bureau's Notice No. 1560 on July 26 of this year that Pan American Airlines has opened two new air routes, Marseille to New York and Southampton to New York.

<h3>Southern City Refugee Area: Starting to Adjust Refugee Relief, Quota Set at 20,000 People, Registration Begins, Father Jacquin Attends Office Regardless of Weather</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent situation of refugees in the Southern City, according to a report yesterday from a certain gentleman at the branch office of the Southern City Refugee Area Supervisory Committee, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Southern City Refugees: Nearly 20,000 People</p>
<p>When Shanghai first experienced hardship, Father Jacquin, based on his humanitarian standpoint and past experience, organized the accommodation of refugees from the Southern City, with numbers exceeding 100,000. Subsequently, with the westward movement of the National Army, approximately eight-tenths of the refugees have left Shanghai voluntarily or been evacuated over the past two years. Currently, there are 19,209 refugees (including 10,197 men, 5,204 women, and 3,708 child refugees). There are also 19,700 residents of the area who have been affected by the war and are also provided with relief equivalent to that given to the refugees, but they do not reside in the shelters.</p>
<p>88 Shelters Established</p>
<p>A total of 88 refugee shelters have been established in the Southern City, mostly in public places. The hygiene management and various facilities are generally satisfactory. However, due to the special circumstances, the education of child refugees has not been as widespread as the establishment of schools in the concession shelters. Each refugee is provided with six taels of rice per day. To ensure the health of the refugees, the Southern City First Hospital and Cian Hospital provide daily medical care and medicine to the refugees.</p>
<p>Economic Resources are Very Depleted</p>
<p>As for economic resources, these rely solely on donations from charitable organizations and individuals, as well as a portion of the surplus from French merchant charity lottery tickets. Therefore, the economy is severely depleted. Starting from September 13, the relief provided to residents of the Southern City will be reduced by half (three taels per day) since most residents in the area have jobs and a basic livelihood sufficient to sustain them. Starting from October 1, it is planned to set the quota for refugees at 20,000 people, and registration is now underway to adjust the arrangements. If investigations reveal that there are residents who genuinely cannot sustain their lives, they will still be provided with relief, and it is planned to establish another shelter.</p>
<p>Current Relief Cost is 70,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Furthermore, an investigation reveals that the existing number of refugees is in a dire situation and cannot be reduced further. The monthly relief cost cannot be determined precisely due to fluctuating rice prices, but it is currently around 70,000 yuan. Father Jacquin attends the office daily regardless of the weather and frequently inspects the various shelters. His spirit of humanitarian service is deeply commendable.</p>

<h3>After the Price Stabilization Ends, Rice Prices Rise Again Yesterday, The Prohibition Order on Tribute Rice Has Not Been Lifted, and National Rice Continues to Arrive, There is No Consideration for a Second Round of Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The price stabilization operation has ended. Mr. Yu Qiaqing said that he considers this price stabilization to be very satisfactory. The gentlemen of the Rice Merchants' Guild have sacrificed their time and effort for the public good, which is truly commendable. Regarding the process and accounts of the price stabilization, the guild will publish them to the public soon. However, seeing the crowded situation of civilians rushing to buy rice, he deeply regrets that it was a drop in the bucket and could not benefit everyone universally. Originally, it was intended to discuss and proceed with another round of price stabilization, but since the origin of tribute rice has not lifted the export prohibition order, and national rice will also arrive continuously, the price of rice is bound to fall, and there is no need to consider it for the time being. He has not heard about the previous rumors that various groups will issue medals to the staff of each price stabilization center to commend them.</p>
<p>Transfer Completed, Scheduled Review</p>
<p>The five tribute rice price stabilization centers in the two concessions have all concluded, and all transfer procedures have been completed. All items used in each center, such as measures and containers, have been returned to the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Guild. In addition to the rice sold and the funds received, which were reported yesterday, the reporter of the New Voice News has further investigated and recorded the following: the five tribute rice price stabilization centers experienced a total loss of 197 piculs of tribute rice and residual rice. The first center had a loss of 100 catties of leftover rice, the second center 293 catties, the third center 354 catties, the fourth center 147 catties, and the fifth center 157 catties. In addition, the first center had 31 catties of other leftover rice, and the fifth center had 100 catties of rotten rice. Together with the cost of the hemp bags, they were all taken back by the association's supervisors. According to the fourth center, 12,000 one-dou tickets and 10,990 five-sheng tickets were sold, but there was one one-dou ticket and two five-sheng tickets, totaling six yuan, for which rice had not been collected. Because the rice has been completely measured, the six yuan has been left for the rice seller to collect upon verification with the original rice tickets. To be accurate, the one-dou tickets should be changed to 11,998 tickets, and the five-sheng tickets should be changed to 10,988 tickets. Now that the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Guild has completely concluded the five tribute rice price stabilization centers, it is scheduled to convene a meeting of the directors of the five centers after the Mid-Autumn Festival to review the conclusion matters.</p>
<p>Announcement of the Conclusion of Broken Rice Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Regarding the price stabilization of 1,000 bags of broken rice in the four price stabilization centers, all were sold out on the 24th. The total amount of rice sold by each center was 1184 piculs and 2 dou, with a loss of 43 piculs, 2 dou, 8 sheng, and 5 shao, 6 catties of extra broken rice, and 10 catties of leftover rice. The association's supervisors have taken back all of them. The total revenue from the sales was 16,578.8 yuan in national currency. The second center has sold broken rice tickets that have not been collected, and the rice has been left in the guild for purchasers to collect with their tickets. Furthermore, there was a discrepancy in the figures reported yesterday by the fifth center, with 800 one-dou tickets and 4,356 five-sheng tickets sold. This morning, the reporter of the New Voice News visited Qu Zhenhua, the executive committee member of the Rice Merchants' Guild, at the bean and rice market. According to Mr. Qu, the decision to carry out the tribute rice price stabilization was due to the scarcity of rice (8,000 bags), which was not enough to solve the problem. However, the fluctuating price of rice recently has had a significant impact on people's food. To stabilize the rice market, it is essential to facilitate the source of national rice, increase reserves, eliminate hoarding, and encourage price reductions. In the rice-producing areas, new crops have already entered the market. He is actively engaging in negotiations to facilitate the flow of national rice, and it is expected that a large amount of national rice will be shipped to Shanghai in the short term. It is reported that the price of rice rose again yesterday.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rose by One Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, merchants registered a total of 4,287 bags of rice for sale at the Rice Market Management Committee. A total of 200 piculs of river cargo arrived. Due to the impact of the end of the price stabilization, the market outlook was higher, and prices rose again. White japonica rice rose by half a yuan per picul, with the highest price being 37 yuan per picul. Changshu and Wuxi new indica rice also rose again, reaching nearly 26 yuan per picul. The highest price for Jiangbei indica rice was originally only 23 yuan per picul, but it has also risen again.</p>
<h3>Busy Settlement Before the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>The Time for Acceptance and Payment at the Check Clearing House and Reserve Treasury is Extended</p>
<p>Because tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, all factories, businesses, trading firms, companies, and Shanghai-based offices of various places in the city should, following commercial practice, settle the accounts with all parties and the receivables and payables before this Mid-Autumn Festival, adhering to the old practice without change. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the accounts of business transactions will be renewed. The receipts and payments of commercial transactions are now mainly based on cash (legal tender) and checks (checks, banker's drafts, remittances, etc.). There are unusually high volumes of mutual receipts and payments. The settlement procedures handled by the Central Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, various commercial banks, foreign banks, and major remittance offices have become extremely busy. The volume of receipts and payments has increased several times compared to normal days. The check clearing house for the silver and money industries and the reserve treasury of the money industry association are the central hubs for the settlement of merchants, and the office hours and time for accepting and paying checks have been invisibly extended.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Continue in the Territory of Chuansha County, Both Chinese and Japanese Troops Have Casualties, Multiple Japanese Planes Flew to Provide Assistance Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Xu Zhidao, the Special Commissioner of the Pudong Loyalty and National Salvation Army Free Army, took office, he has now completed the reorganization of various units and actively strengthened his forces. Therefore, the Japanese side pays special attention to him. The Pudong war, which had been dormant, has become fierce again. According to people from Pudong who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the Japanese side had recently dispatched</p>
<p>a team of about 150 Japanese soldiers with light and heavy weapons, attacking Huangjialu and Datieqiao in two routes. This area is the defense zone of Xu Chengde, under Xu Zhidao. After Xu learned of this, he quickly assigned the first company to the south of Datieqiao, the second company to defend the Niuduzi area, the third company to be responsible for Huangjialu, and the fourth company to the Liuzaogang area. At the same time, they counterattacked the Japanese troops advancing on the highway. For a time, the fighting was fierce, and the sound of small mortars</p>
<p>lasted for eight hours before stopping. Then, because it was inconvenient for Xu's troops to defend Laogang to the death, they retreated to the west of Erzaohong, holding strongholds in the outer river and pond areas. After a short rest, they again divided into teams to counterattack west from Laogang. The battle is still ongoing. It is reported that the Japanese side suffered heavy casualties in this battle. On the National Army side, officer Han Shulin was killed, and soldiers Liang Zhifa, Yang Deming, Li Shoudao, Qiu Mingqing, Xu Dechang, and messenger Yang Jinrong were wounded. Commander Xu</p>
<p>has provided compensation, with a bonus of 10 yuan for each wounded soldier, 20 yuan for each wounded officer, and a burial fee of 20 yuan for each soldier killed, to show his appreciation. Yesterday morning, several Japanese planes, carrying bombs, went to assist in the fighting.</p>

<p>The Nagasaki Maru of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha was originally scheduled to sail to Nagasaki, Japan, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, but it was unable to depart due to a crew strike. The reason was to demand severance pay and guarantee of treatment in the new company. It is reported that the ship will soon be transferred to the newly formed "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." by the Japanese side. According to the crew, the old company has suffered losses over the years, but the company has refused to acknowledge this.</p>

<h3>Expansion of the Double Tenth Festival Disaster Relief Campaign</h3>
<p>The Public Unanimously Supports the Cause, Donations Continue for Another Year</p>
<p>October 10th is the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, will launch a disaster relief campaign throughout the country on that day to raise funds to provide relief to compatriots in distress. According to reporters from the Daguang News Agency, the various groups in Shanghai greatly agree with Mr. Xu's proposal. As the Double Tenth Festival is approaching, they are currently exchanging ideas and preparing to expand the campaign. They also plan to send personnel to visit refugees in various shelters. The public in all sectors believes that in this extraordinary period, when the country is in great difficulty, and considering Shanghai's unique environment, they do not plan to splurge on the Double Tenth Festival or hold celebratory ceremonies. Their belief in the War of Resistance and National Construction is even more steadfast. In addition to the city uniformly raising flags and taking a day off, they are determined to enthusiastically support the disaster relief campaign. Businesses and other sectors that originally pledged to support refugees and donate to disaster relief, although the one-year period has expired, are mostly voluntarily continuing for another year to maintain the relief provided to refugees and stabilize the order of the isolated island.</p>

The purpose of towing the seven cotton barges to Hongkou is unknown. It is reported that the cotton has been forcibly purchased by Japanese factories, so it was towed there for unloading. However, when asked, the merchants from Shen Yuanlai and others were unaware of the barges being towed to Hongkou. They are currently trying to negotiate the release of the detained barges. The cotton transported by the Tonghe Wheel the other day was unloaded onto two iron barges due to the above-mentioned reason. It was unloaded at the Observatory Wharf yesterday. There were more than ten cotton barges originally parked at the site last Saturday. The unloading was disrupted by the Japanese side, so the work was stopped immediately. It is now learned that it has been completely unloaded.</p>

<h3>Appeal Debate in the Case of Notorious Bandit Ta Yongkuan and His Son, Verdict Scheduled for the 30th of this Month</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, Li Bihua (erroneously reported as Hua), three bandits from Anhui Province, notorious salt smugglers, taking advantage of the westward retreat of the National Army in the winter of the year before last, gathered bandits in the Ruanxiang area of Songjiang, claiming to be guerrillas, and set fire, killed, looted property, and raped women everywhere. They also forcibly robbed two women, Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian, from Xihutang, and forced them to marry Jia Zhou and Bihua as wives. Li Jia Zhou then shot and killed Lin's mother and buried her. Li Yongkuan, claiming that the Lin family had no descendants, sold Lin's house to a local bully, Lu Baoren. At the end of last spring, they were disarmed by the regular army. Unable to gain a foothold, Li and his family, along with the two women,</p>
<p>fled to Shanghai and hid in Xujiahui in western Shanghai, confining Lin and She and prohibiting them from moving freely. Until last December, the two women escaped and reported to the French police, who arrested Li and the other three people one after another. Stolen goods, such as leather clothing, gold bracelets, and gold rings from the Lin and She families, were found in their home and sent to the Second Special Court. After investigation, the French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against them for robbery, murder, rape, and illegal detention. Lin and She also filed an incidental civil suit, each requesting 8,000 yuan in consolation money and 500 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. Because Li and others committed crimes in the interior, regarding the issue of jurisdiction, the Second Special Court submitted a request to the Third Higher Branch Court, which then submitted it to the Supreme Court, designating the Second Special Court</p>
<p>to hear the case. As a result of the trial, on the 16th of last month, Li Yongkuan was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for continuous robbery and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Li Jia Zhou was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for continuous robbery, five years of imprisonment for rape, and fifteen years of imprisonment for murder, to be served concurrently for eighteen years, and fifteen years of deprivation of civil rights. Li Bihua was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for continuous robbery and five years of imprisonment for rape, to be served concurrently for ten years, and eight years of deprivation of civil rights. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. Regarding the civil suit portion, it has been concluded by the civil court. On the 23rd of this month, a verdict was issued ordering Li Jia Zhou and Li Bihua to each compensate Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian 800 yuan in national currency. Li Jia Zhou also had to bear 200 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. All these details have been recorded in this newspaper. Because Li</p>
<p>and his three sons were dissatisfied with the criminal verdict of the Second Special Court in the first trial, they jointly retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as agents to file an appeal with the Third Higher Branch Court. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Gu Hongbiao and Xiang Zu, and Prosecutor Zhao Changmin, convened a joint trial. According to the reasons for the appeal stated by Li and his sons, they did not believe that the looting and robbery were such. They claim that, with Lu Baoren and Cai Dingyi, the local town leaders, as matchmakers, they married Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian as daughters-in-law. It was only after arriving in Shanghai that Lin and She were instigated by others to falsely accuse them of robbery and murder, resulting in severe sentences.</p>
<p>They requested a clear investigation, the revocation of the original judgment, and a declaration of innocence. Then, the original plaintiffs, Lin Xiuhua and Yu Yuexian, stated the circumstances of being robbed, forced into marriage, and the three robberies in their home, as well as the process of Li Jia Zhou killing Lin's mother. The court also summoned witness Zhang Hongkui and the investigating detective for questioning. As the details of the case were clear, the court ordered the opening of the debate. First, the prosecutor stated his opinion, saying that it was learned that the appellants had committed such a serious crime during a period of local disorder, and they should be punished severely according to law to deter wrongdoing. The original judgment of imprisonment seemed lenient. He requested the presiding judge to make a judgment according to law. Then, after lawyers Yao Zhaodi of the French Concession authorities and the defense lawyers Fan and Yu debated, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 30th. The appellants were still returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Assaulting Mother and Daughter</h3>
<p>The Two Convicts Dissatisfied with the Sentence, the Appeal Trial Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Gu Yang, a woman from Jiangbei living at No. 96, Dakang Lane, Kangdi Road, had a sixteen-year-old daughter, Fendi, who worked in a silk factory. She had to pass in front of the house of her fellow villager, Jiang Xiaosizi (licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Council to operate a cesspit), at No. 152, Xiachengfang, Renshou Lane, Caishi Road, twice a day, morning and evening. Jiang Zimei, the son of Jiang Xiaosizi, was sixteen years old this year. Every time he saw Gu's daughter passing by, he would touch her hands and breasts</p>
<p>and sexually harass her. On the afternoon of July 11th, at 6:00 p.m., when Gu's daughter was returning home from work, passing by Jiang's house, Jiang Zimei again harassed her and hugged her, dragging her into the house. After she struggled and cried out, he released her and she fled home. She cried and told her mother, Gu Yang. That night, the mother and daughter went to Jiang's house to argue, but were beaten and injured by Jiang and his son,</p>
<p>and their clothes were torn. Gu Yang and her daughter then retained lawyers Li Mingzhou and Lian Ze to request an injury examination from the Second Special Court. Afterwards, they filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Jiang Xiaosizi and Jiang Zimei for assault and indecent assault, and filed an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation for medical expenses of 60 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen. The defendants retained lawyer Wei Weiqing to defend them and filed a counterclaim</p>
<p>accusing them of defamation. As a result of the initial trial, Jiang Xiaosizi and Jiang Zimei were sentenced to detention for assault, which could be converted to a fine of two yuan per day. Gu Yang's self-accusation against Jiang Zimei and counterclaim were both dismissed. Gu Yang was found not guilty. Because Jiang and his son were dissatisfied with the verdict, they retained lawyer Song Yuntao to file an appeal with the Third Higher Branch Court.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., presiding Judge Wu Tingqi convened a joint trial and summoned both parties and witness No. 332 to the case to question them about the situation at the time. He then announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the verdict for the 30th.</p>
<h3>New Tricks of the Con Artists, the Spring Lock Scam Fails, Pan Qiliang Arrested While Trying to Escape</h3>
<p>Pan Qiliang (24 years old) from Changzhou, and Jiang Shiguang, Zhang the Tea Seller, Qian Boxiang, and others who are at large, usually set up fictitious firms or use a gambling game called "1234" to swindle people out of their property.</p>
<p>There are countless people who have been deceived by them. On the 22nd of this month, Pan and others used the same trick again. They went to Ruicheng Hardware Store in Zunde Lane, Qingmen Road, pretending that they had opened a Dasheng firm in the Jin Yu Inn on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession. They claimed that they had been entrusted by a merchant to buy twenty dozen new-style spring locks (worth more than 600 yuan), and they would bring the money back as soon as the goods were delivered. Ma Songquan, the manager of the store,</p>
<p>believing them to be true, prepared the goods and ordered his apprentice, Lu Wenqiao, to follow Pan. As soon as they arrived at the inn, two men took the goods, and told Lu to follow Pan to the bank to collect the money. Unexpectedly, Pan seized the opportunity to escape halfway. He was spotted near Maidiyan Road by detectives Ke Enqing and Ke Enhong of the French Concession Police, who, seeing that his</p>
<p>expression was flustered, stepped forward to arrest him. He confessed the truth after being taken to the police station. Therefore, Pan Qiliang was sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court yesterday for investigation. After Judge Zhu examined the case, he ordered a postponement of the hearing for further investigation and arrest of accomplices, as the investigation was still needed. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Theft at the Jianye Silk Factory, Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, more than a dozen armed bandits broke into the back door of the Jianye Silk Factory at No. 551, Tokyo Road, Shanghai West, silenced those who made a sound with guns, and stole six large packages of raw silk (weighing about 130 pounds), worth more than 6,000 yuan, before fleeing with the stolen goods. After reporting the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station, detectives Xu Decheng and Wu Dekui were dispatched to investigate the factory. Chen Aliang, the cook from Shaoxing, Ye Jincai, the cook, and Gao Jinrong, a laborer from Yangzhou, were suspected of colluding with the bandits as insiders. Chen and the other three were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan described the case and requested their detention. Chen, Ye, and Gao, the three suspects, stammered in their confessions and denied the charges. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Impersonating the Fire Brigade to Sell Fire Extinguishers: Young Man Guo Yao Arrested</h3>
<p>A local young man named Guo Yao (also known as Guo Bianting), impersonated the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade to print a large number of cards to sell fire extinguishers for the Dahua Fire Prevention Association. He was arrested by Detective Ding Yu and handed over to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. He was prosecuted for fraud and other crimes. Judge Fang Qinghuan interrogated him in the courtroom. The defendant, Guo Yao, admitted that he was a salesman for the Dahua Fire Prevention Association, but denied impersonating the Municipal Council Fire Brigade, claiming that the Dahua fire extinguishers were approved for sale by the Fire Brigade and were not illegal. The court then questioned the plaintiff, Ding Yuhua, who testified, "I run a lunch box business. Now, due to rising prices, business is slow, and I cannot afford to install a fire extinguisher. The defendant said he was sent by the Fire Brigade and insisted on installing one for 18 yuan. That's why I called the police. I don't know if he is real or fake." After verifying the statements, the court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing until next Monday.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Moales Case: Testimony of the Autopsy Doctor</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the case of Moales, an employee of the Municipal Council's Health Department, accused of causing death by negligence, continued its trial this morning (the 25th) at the British Police Court, with Registrar Haines presiding. Dr. Gang Wright testified that on the morning of September 9th, he dissected the body of a Chinese man at the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital. The deceased's face showed evidence of being beaten. An examination of the deceased's heart revealed that it was about twice the normal size due to several diseases. If the deceased had to engage in any strenuous work, these diseases would likely have caused his death within two months. Other witnesses called to court this morning included Mr. Hui of the Public Works Department, who described the terrain of the area, and Mr. Kepenntan of the Health Department, who accompanied the defendant on the night of the incident, also testified about the circumstances of the incident. The defendant's lawyer, Li Kesi, cross-examined the witnesses. The case was adjourned until 10:00 AM on Friday.</p>
<h3>Smoking Opium: Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment, Commutable to a Fine</h3>
<p>Ye Meisheng, a Ningbo native residing at the residence of the late Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Youren, is fifty years old. Recently, the Police Department received a tip that his home was an opium trafficking center. Yesterday morning (the 25th), a large number of Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to surround the entire residence and search it. Ye Meisheng was arrested on the spot, and dozens of taels of opium, dozens of cans of opium paste, two valuable opium pipes, opium lamps, and other items were confiscated and taken to the police station. In the afternoon, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the court for prosecution in accordance with the law. Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned him, and the defendant confessed to smoking opium. The court verified the statements and immediately pronounced the verdict, which stated: "Ye Meisheng is sentenced to six months of imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for one year, and ordered to quit opium within one month. If he commutes the sentence to a fine, it will be calculated at three yuan per day."</p>
<h3>Police Officer Becomes a Bandit: Sentenced to Twelve Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Li Ziming, a Shandong native who previously served as Chinese Constable No. 774 at the Huishi Police Station, demanded a bribe from Jin Meisheng, the owner of Swallow's Nest at No. 4, Lane 527, Yihua Road, on October 19th of last year. When Jin refused, Li shot and injured him. On the same day, he also shot and injured Yang Ronghua, the doorman of the Shengsheng Trust Company at No. 80 Ningbo Road, and fled his post. On July 8th of this year, Li and his accomplices armed with weapons robbed Yan Yuncheng's home at No. 1297 Yuyuan Road of 20 yuan in legal tender. During their escape, they opened fire on Japanese Constable No. 789 and Chinese Constables No. 2189 and No. 2495 along the way. Li was shot and injured and captured. When he was sent to the First Special Court for trial, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning and sentenced Li Ziming to seven years of imprisonment for conspiring to break into a residence and steal at night with deadly weapons, six years of imprisonment for attempted murder, and seven years of imprisonment for continuous attempted murder, to be served for a total of twelve years. One pistol and four bullets were confiscated and temporarily stored at the police station.</p>
<h3>Grand Wedding of Ai Sun</h3>
<p>Mr. Ai Weichao, who studied electrical engineering in England and is an outstanding talent in our country's machinery field, currently works as an engineer at the British-owned Wanbao Yangxing in Shanghai. Yesterday, he married Miss Sun Yuanzhen, the eldest daughter of Mr. Sun Liangzheng, at the Moore Memorial Church. Miss Sun graduated from the Department of Sociology at Tsinghua University and has a deep understanding of Chinese and Western cultures. Mr. Ai and Miss Sun were old classmates and are both devout Christians who share the same ideals and are a perfect match. It is said that they will go to Kunming after their marriage to serve the academic community. Yesterday, many prominent figures from the business and academic circles attended, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of your newspaper:</p>
<p>Having read the news article "Lawyer Yang Yiming Assaults People, Shops Jointly Provide Proof" in your newspaper on the 21st of this month, it states that Judge Qiu presented the joint public statement signed by more than 30 shop residents of Siyi Village, who witnessed Yang's assault, to Yang for inspection. Yang Yiming then stated in court that since the shop residents had personally witnessed the incident, he requested the court to summon them to appear in court for questioning. Judge Qiu verified the statement and announced that the case would be re-examined at a later date. We are extremely surprised by this. Lawyer Yang Yiming does indeed reside at No. 33 Siyi Village, Huixi Street, Xujiahui, in the same village as the shop residents. However, the shop residents did not actually witness him assaulting Madam Song Wang from Songjiang. How could they have signed a joint public statement? It is clear that unscrupulous individuals are using our names to deceive others. We were about to write a letter requesting a correction when we saw the letter from Lawyer Yang Yiming in your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, which stated that "the truth of the case will be judged fairly, and as for the joint statement from the shops discovered during the trial to be irregular," etc. This confirms that the shop residents have unintentionally offended their neighbor due to the pranks of others, and it is a completely undeserved disaster. This not only fabricates rumors but also concerns personal reputation. Therefore, in addition to waiting to be summoned for questioning, we dare to write this letter for correction and hope that it will be published to clarify the truth for the public. We are deeply grateful for this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Representatives of the shops in Siyi Village:</p>
<p>Huang Liansheng, owner of Huixin Shop</p>
<p>Yang Qinshan, owner of Huiji Workshop</p>
<p>Representatives of the residents:</p>
<p>Guo Xihua</p>

<h3>Spark-like Life</h3>
<p>— Guo Guo</p>
<p>Sparks - bright, burning. And the life of youth should be like that spark.</p>
<p>The life of youth should be vigorous, full of light and heat; but even so, it is still not enough. We should use the brilliant "light" emitted from our own lives to burn away the dark side of society, so that countless people who have fallen into the black prison can use your "light" to climb out of the black prison; and the huge amount of "heat" emitted in your life should be used to warm those who feel cold, so that they can also generate the same huge amount of heat as a driving force for advancement.</p>
<p>The creation of sparks is due to the collision of two "forces". The idea of living is inherent in human beings, and then, certain improper desires arise. If human beings do not sanction those improper desires and eliminate them, but instead want to satisfy them, then not only will conflicts between people increase as a result, but the justice of the world will also be completely destroyed; the evolution of the world will inevitably stagnate, and may even exceed the barbarity of the primitive era. People have an instinct for doing good: to fully develop what is right, and to sanction and destroy what is wrong. The force that stimulates desire may be unavoidable, but the ability to restrain desire is even more excellent. The encounter and collision of the two "forces" will emit bright, burning sparks in life. This "heat" drives them forward, and this "light" illuminates them to seize great objects. If we give this kind of person a name, then it is "hero". And youth should have a "heroic" life - here, we must recognize that a personal "hero" does not exist, whether for oneself or for the public. We evenly promote these two "forces", make these two "forces" fight fiercely, and make our own lives full of light and heat, like a spark.</p>
<p>The so-called spark-like life is not mysterious, just as the spark itself is not a mysterious thing. Primitive humans saw the fire come and go without fixed time, sometimes seeing it set off a flame that burned the sky, and sometimes seeing the flame disappear without a trace, and felt that this was a mysterious and elusive thing. But thanks to the efforts of scientists, they learned that "fire" is just a phenomenon of combustion, and combustion depends on the support of gases (such as oxygen, etc.). The birth and death of flames are closely related to the amount of oxygen content. In ancient times, humans were "ruled by fire; but in modern times, humans control "fire". Regarding life, we should also take off the mysterious coat. The power of "gods", "ghosts", and "fate" can never shake or control our lives. To fan the flames of our lives, we must first increase the content of "air elements" in our lives. The reason why the flame of a person's life is dim is because the content of "oxygen" in their life is too thin. I dare not say that this is the truth, but the boundary marker between the "bitterness" and "happiness", "fulfillment" and "emptiness" of life is here.</p>
<p>Sparks - bright, burning, and the life of youth should be like that spark.</p>
<h3>Love of the River</h3>
<p>— Tang Wei</p>
<p>——Records Picked Up From Ashes——</p>
<p>For some reason, I decided to live with Lao Chong.</p>
<p>Our residence is at the end of the street, a board room near the river; this place is very much like the fairy cave in "Liaozhai". Artemisia clings to the three-sided walls, and unknown insects chirp day and night, not allowing you to have a moment of quiet thought; - fortunately, we have escaped the white Russian vagrants and prostitutes. The drunken songs after drinking always make me occasionally hear them, but because they are too far away, I find them vaguely interesting.</p>
<p>The river water by the window is like a mirror lying face up, and the lights render countless mottled golden spots on the water.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by it.</p>
<p>The overlapping ripples, the crane-wing-like shadows of sails, ridiculed me several fire-like rams; I decided to leave it several times, - but soon I appeared again on its floating sand embankment.</p>
<p>Now, the Songhua River also seems to have changed its appearance; its huge figure seems to be a virgin who has just been ravaged, lying tired and in pain.</p>
<p>I can't bear to look at it any longer, and I don't know what force is secretly teasing me! I can't sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>It's late at night.</p>
<p>I walked onto the floating sand embankment again. There was no sound of dust, and I lowered my breath. I gently held up the river water with my hand and kissed it on the mouth - this tender comfort made the river water sob even more deeply.</p>
<p>Across the river, the barking of dogs and the lush villages are beckoning me affectionately in the shadows!</p>
<p>I watched over everything living in this cruel fate until the autumn mist dampened my hair.</p>
<p>It was already dawn when I came back.</p>
<p>Lao Chong told me that this section of the river is often used as a secret execution ground by the port military police at night, and I realized that I had just taken a big risk unknowingly.</p>
<h3>Holland Waiting with Spears as Pillows</h3>
<p>— Written by Philip Debock, Translated by Wang Baishi</p>
<p>Today's Holland is still as strong as before. Compulsory military service has been further expanded. Every man between the ages of 19 and 55 has the obligation to perform military service. Generally, every 19-year-old youth must undergo eight months of military training. Those with higher education receive even longer training and are commissioned as reserve officers (N.C.Os). From the ages of 19 to 28, they serve in the field army, and after this age, they join the national defense force. Therefore, although Holland has a population of only nine million, it has nearly 800,000 soldiers. These troops are fully trained, well-equipped, and can be mobilized within 24 hours; some (such as those defending the border or coastline) can be concentrated within six hours.</p>
<p>The main component of the Dutch army is the field army - the most elite unit; they are ready to strike at the fierce aggressor at any time.</p>
<p>The Dutch border does not have strong fortifications like the Maginot Line or the Siegfried Line. Furthermore, the border line is too long. To build such fortifications, even for the wealthy Netherlands, would be too expensive. But it cannot be said that Holland has no defenses at all. On the border with Germany and Belgium, many posts and other defensive works are scattered without deviation, surprising neutral observers.</p>
<p>The Dutch army is not used to invade other countries, but to resist aggression. Its defensive line is built according to the natural terrain. Currently, its biggest hypothetical enemy is the German army. The first natural defensive line in the east is the Ysel and Meuse rivers, which flow north and south. West of the Zuider Sea and Maastricht, there are high mountains and steep ridges, forming an exceptionally strong natural defensive line. Even in peacetime, it is firmly guarded. Along the line are many guard posts, dark intercept platforms, and countless solid trenches and other defensive works. The bridge markers on the river are planted with mines in peacetime, so in an emergency, the government in The Hague only needs to give an order, and they can immediately be blown to pieces.</p>
<p>The second defensive line is in the Eem River basin. This is a small river that flows north from Wageningen (on the Rhine River), along Amersfoort, into the Zuider Sea. The entire river passes through a ten-mile-wide plain. This plain is surrounded by large mountains in the east and west. If the Rhine River water or the Zuider Sea water is introduced into this plain, it will immediately become a vast ocean one or two feet deep within one or two hours.</p>
<p>Readers may not be able to imagine how effective this flooding defense line would be. The flooding near Dixmuyde during the last European war can be said to be close to this strategy; however, that was only used as an expedient measure. Holland is now planning it in detail in peacetime, and its effectiveness is of course greater. Holland accurately knows the source of the water, has established many water gates, and people (mostly reserve soldiers) live near the water gates so that they can open the gates at any time. Holland also fully knows the direction of the water flow, the size of the flooded area, and the water depth at each location. In peacetime, they have prepared special maps to mark all of this.</p>
<p>In 1914, the accidental flooding of the Western Front saved the British, French, and Belgian armies from defeat. Therefore, Holland's well-prepared waterlogging strategy can at least strike a blow to the enemy, while greatly helping the country's army defend the motherland, there is no doubt about it. They will then completely flood the ground, with just enough water so that it is too shallow to sail, but deep enough to make it impossible to distinguish between the hundreds of small canals that intersect and cut across the Dutch pastures and the land, greatly hindering the enemy army. The enemy's heavy tanks will be completely ineffective and will have to wade through the mud.</p>
<p>The Dutch military authorities are confident that many flooding defense lines will not be breached by the enemy. However, the people behind the defense line may suffer terrible aerial bombardments, which may lead them to abandon the defense.</p>
<p>Therefore, air defense has become a major issue for Holland. The Dutch Air Force consists of three regiments, and all the aircraft and combatants are very good. Dutch civil aviation has a long-standing reputation in the world.</p>
<p>There is one regiment of anti-aircraft artillery, and the equipment is the latest.</p>
<p>As for maritime defense, Holland relies mainly on submarines, motor torpedo boats, and other small warships. Most of the large warships are used in the Dutch East Indies. These small warships, driven by the famous Dutch sailors, rushing and crashing in the shallow sea, are precisely the vanguards that are difficult for the aggressor to deal with!</p>
<p>Whether Germany dares to break Holland's neutrality and attack it recklessly, who knows?</p>
<h3>Heart's Song</h3>
<p>— Wen Xi</p>
<p>I wish for a violent storm, a high tide of waves, to drive away the sorrow that lingers in my heart all day long.</p>
<p>I cannot see the smile of youth, nor the enthusiastic surge of young people; everything is followed by shadows.</p>
<p>I feel empty all over, as if I am starving, and I am gradually developing a disgust for this world.</p>
<p>The previous life was in the dark, but sometimes it was also full of happiness. Comparing it with the present, I only get "unbearable memories". Therefore, people build their lives on the "future". This unblown flower bud is placed in a passionate heart and cultivated with all their energy.</p>
<p>The current suffering can only be endured. The dim light is not to be mourned. Even in the darkness, my will cannot be obscured.</p>
<p>I wish for a cup of bitter wine, swallowed into my throat, and the last tear to fall, and then I will say goodbye to pain.</p>
<p>I wish I could sing a few short songs every day, telling my wishes, so that I can have a pure heart and not enter the muddy stream.</p>

<h3>The Future of Spoken Drama in Shanghai Yang Liu</h3>
<p>Some theories in the world seem to remain just theories forever. When those who advocate these theories put them into practice, their work changes direction. It is certainly accurate to say that drama cannot be separated from the masses. Drama is propaganda, it is education, even the most ardent advocates of art for art's sake cannot deny this. The direction that progressive drama practitioners have been striving for in recent years has been in this area. Not only drama, but drama is just a wave in the huge tide of "cultural people going to the masses." But looking at the isolated island, when will this fervent faith go? There are many people engaged in the drama movement, and many drama troupes have been established one after another. However, the object of their work is not the ideal of how to attract a large audience, thus creating a situation where spoken drama has no mass support. Of course, it can also be said that this is due to their weak abilities, but their fatal flaw is not here. In their minds, they despise the audience of the "Living Buddha Jigong" who are full every day, the audience of "Burning the Red Lotus Temple," the masses in the civilized theaters of Tianyunlou and the Great World, and even the audience of the Green Treasure Theater.</p>
<p>The audience of "Living Buddha Jigong" and the civilized theaters have their own historical basis, so let's not discuss them for the time being. The Green Treasure Theater has only been in Shanghai for one or two years, but now it occupies a superior position in the entertainment industry, which is not accidental. In addition to one or two so-called movie stars as a gimmick, the rest of the Green Treasure Theater are still just old characters from civilized theater troupes. However, their performing style is "spoken drama," not "civilized drama." If we want to delve into it, then they have indeed adopted the strengths of civilized drama and put them into the form of spoken drama. Therefore, the success of the same script when performed at the Green Treasure Theater will far surpass that of the current theaters that use spoken drama as a gimmick. Conversely, even without a good script, the Green Treasure Theater can still rely on the actors' "special skills" to maintain itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, professional spoken drama theaters open and close, and it always seems difficult to gain a foothold. Although they have repeatedly failed in business, they can still comfort themselves by thinking: "It is said that the audience in Shanghai is too naive." This idea is certainly justified. Taking the "Swastika Palace" and "Lafayette" in front of us as examples, their hosts are always people with experience in studying drama, but when they stage an unfamiliar script, they have no confidence in success. They cannot establish a strong faith in the audience. After staging an unfamiliar script, the audience shakes their heads and leaves, and to be honest, there are more unsatisfactory scripts than satisfactory ones! After that, the audience they have only has a part of the spoken drama enthusiasts, and the general public will never have a good impression of the clumsy spoken drama.</p>
<p>If spoken drama activists do not focus on winning over the audience, they can only watch it decline day by day. But how can we win over a large audience? In addition to focusing on training actors' skills, the most important thing is a change in psychology -- even if the audience is naive, don't give up on them. The masses are originally naive, but they need to be educated, so that you can cultivate them to have a high level of appreciation. Don't let them only watch "Living Buddha Jigong," and don't let them always be just "the audience of the Green Treasure Theater!"</p>
<p>After Watching Huang Jinrong's New Roles</p>
<p>On the twenty-first day, Huang Jinrong met with people from all walks of life on the stage. The reporter was able to witness the grand occasion and recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>First Day</p>
<p>Wu Yanheng's "Picking the Hua Che" was on stage before eight o'clock. Mr. Wu's tall figure, the appearance is the appearance, the physique is the physique, and the movements are clean and neat. His voice is also loud, and the singing and recitation are wonderful. The large section of "Pomegranate Flower" sounds like a small building, and the loud shout has the wonderful effect of stopping the clouds. The gathering of fights and the martial arts of picking the car are fiery in the rules. When Liu Yongli, who played the target, and Wu Yanheng fought each other, they exhausted the beauty of peony and green leaves. Yang Shisen later performed "Empty City Stratagem." The singing on the city tower was full of charm, and a few lines of the "rocking board" were even more wonderful. Then, Song Dezhu performed "Fighting at Xin'an Station." Because he learned from Xun Huisheng, the stage steps were very different from Xun's wonderfulness. Running around, it was simply a mess on the stage. The recitation also learned from Huisheng, which was extremely moving. The voice was slightly hoarse, but the melody was appropriate, which was really good. The acting lacked delicacy, and sometimes it was excessive. The wedding chamber scene was mediocre. The best scene in the whole play was the "Martial Arts Contest to Recruit a Son-in-Law." Fighting with Li Debin was seamless and wonderful to the point of perfection. Li Debin's young man, although he can strictly abide by the norms, is too rigid. Ai Shiju is still the same as before, and Ci Shaoquan's voice is brighter and has made a lot of progress.</p>
<p>Second Day</p>
<p>On stage, Yan Chong performed "Evil Tiger Village," which was another scene. The body and feet were quite good. "Evil Tiger Village" cannot be pleasing without martial arts and literary singing. To be able to sing, recite, act, and fight, one can be competent. Yanheng can be said to have all four, so the performance is wonderful from beginning to end. "Beating the Drum and Cursing Cao" is Yang Xiaolou's signature play, so of course it is good. Xiaolou's drum has always been called a masterpiece, and no one else can do it. Yuan Shihai's Cao Cao is better than Ma Jun, and there are several Hao school postures when listening to the drum. He is worthy of being a disciple of the Hao family. Later, Song Dezhu performed "Flooding Jinshan Temple." Dezhu played the White Lady. In the scene where she begged Fahai to save Xu Xian, there were many movements, and the performance was methodical and the style was beautiful. The stilt work showed even more skill. Mao Shilai and Yan Shishan were more than twice as good as Bai Yushuang.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang from Northeast China Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Since the Huaxin Company filmed the humorous and interesting films "Mr. Wang's Difficulties in Eating" and "Mr. Wang and the Second Landlord," it has aroused a deep impression in the society. Because Mr. Wang and his partners Xiao Chen, Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Chen, and Xiao Ayuan, express the turbulent life of the lower class in the isolated island, it is too incisive. Mr. Wang and other typical characters are from the pen of cartoonist Ye Qianyu. Originally, only people near Shanghai knew him. After he was on the screen, the publicity was wide. Recently, Mr. Wang has appeared in Donglansheng, and people there are said to be filming Mr. Wang's films. The matter started like this. An art magazine called "East Asia Sightseeing," published in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, reprinted Qianyu's paintings and renamed them "The Unofficial History of Mr. Chen's Trip to Beijing," which tells the story of Mr. Wang and Xiao Chen going to Nanjing to become officials. It is very popular among the general public. Some speculators heard that Mr. Wang's films were very popular in Shanghai, and they also wanted to imitate them, so they planned it. However, they filmed silent films, and there were no standard talents like Tang Jie, so the results were said to be inferior.</p>
<h3>Brief Reports on the Art Scene Hua</h3>
<p>"Sai Jinhua," which will be staged at the Xuan Palace Theater during the Mid-Autumn Festival, is based on Xiong Foxi's script and adapted by Wei Ruhui. The content is quite lively, with Peking Opera singing and other scenes. Lan Lan is playing Sai Jinhua, so Lan Lan is working hard to practice Peking Opera these days.</p>
<p>Zhang Shankun personally directed "One Night Queen," which will be screened at the Grand Guangming Theater at 5:30 this afternoon.</p>
<p>"It's a bit embarrassing not to watch" "Wen Su Chen" has been greatly revised by the original author Zhu Shilin after it was put on the screen. For example, Wen Su Chen on the stage has many concubines, but Wen Su Chen on the screen has nothing but a clumsy wife at home; therefore, Liu Jiqun said to people: "I don't have the good fortune of Qi Lintong."</p>
<p>"Song of Shanghai" is set for the 29th night</p>
<p>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</p>
<h3>Being Clever Turns Out to Be a Joke</h3>
<p>As for the fact that Sister Thirteen wrote poems on the wall after that, of course it was not to wipe the blood off the knife out of fear. Besides, she was clearly holding a precious knife that killed people without seeing blood. Except for the possibility that there might still be blood on the handle of the knife, it is a deception to say that blood could be stained on the back or blade of the knife. Furthermore, even if the precious knife was unfortunately stained with blood, it would never be like saving someone from the river, controlling the water for half a day. What's more, it's not enough to control and flick it, and finally wipe it on the sole of the shoe, that's simply cursing Sister Thirteen's precious knife. He would not have thought that He Yufeng was originally a Han Chinese with bound feet, not a Manchurian with big feet. How could the three-inch golden lotus wipe clean the blood stains on both sides of a knife that was four or five inches long and about two feet long? Isn't this another unreasonable absurdity? Looking at this play, it's just a change in the costume of boots and shoes, but it has already caused the above joke. From this, it can be seen that those who advocate reforming old plays must consider everything carefully in order to avoid being ridiculed, but how easy is this!</p>
<p>I once saw Chen Laofuzi (Delin) play the Empress Dowager Xiao in "Visiting Her Mother." Because he often saw the back of the Empress Dowager Cixi when he was serving in the inner court, he also slightly imitated the Empress Dowager's steps and the dignified and generous attitude when he was about to leave the stage in the play, and added the gongs and drums on the stage. It really had a look. Later, Wang Qinnong imitated it and became famous for it. In recent years, even though singers in Beiping such as Zhu Qixiang were far inferior in singing skills, they also won the welcome of the audience by selling these few steps. Who knew that a certain actor who played "Sister Thirteen" would go even further. When he played the role of Empress Dowager Xiao, he staggered every step when he first came on stage, just like the movements and steps of Cao Fu, who played the role of "Tianmen Walks in the Snow." He hunched his back to deliberately show an old and decrepit appearance. (107)</p>
<p>will be performed at Lafayette Theater, and a grand reception is prepared.</p>
<p>Guohua Company will produce all costume films in the future. Several months ago, the Shenxin and Liangbao cover advertisements had collected dozens of folk stories such as "Du Shiniang" and "He Wenxiu." Recently, it may be published again,</p>
<p>to avoid other companies using the same stories.</p>
<p>In addition to Xuan Palace and Lafayette, someone is planning a spoken drama theater. The site has been selected, which is a theater in Shanghai that is most suitable for performing spoken drama, but there are still problems with the actors, so it is not convenient to announce it for the time being.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting Chen Yunshang on the screen, the photos taken by herself are now specially taken by photographer Lang Jingshan in the latest style, as many as two or three hundred kinds, with unique and precious postures. It is said that the first batch of twenty-four new styles will be sold from today at the four major companies on Nanjing Road, the China National Products Company, and the Shanghai Grand Theater.</p>
