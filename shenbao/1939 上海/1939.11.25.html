<h3 id="c8">制裁食米之投機 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>上海近頃百物昂貴，以米油柴炭爲尤甚；是皆投機者喪心病在之所爲，亦租界當局與社會公團不事糾正之所致耳。居民號稱五百萬，以五百萬人生活問題付之投機奸商之手、此其危險孰甚？明知危險而長此放任，不加制裁，此則今日之上海而外，殆古今中外無其偶也。</p>
<p>五百萬居民之中，少數爲外人，彼等收入或以其本國貨幣爲標準，或計法幣而別有滙水之補償；少數爲富厚之家，少數爲高俸之輩；凡是者，對於物價不合理之昂貴，漫不經心。若居民中絕大多數之薪工階級，月入大都在二三十圓乃至百圓間耳，米珠薪桂之結果，誰不羅掘俱空；彼一家數口，每日食米三四升者，若月入爲三四十元，則僅敷買米之用，試問除米之外，房租也，衣着也，油鹽蔬菜柴炭也，以及必不可少之日用雜費，將何所取給乎？况收入愈微薄，米之需要愈大，蓋捨此別無充飢之物。故戰時民食，常有專設機關管理，司調節平準之責，以安定民生，違者則刑罰隨之。即如重慶，亦設有物價評定委員會，就米煤油三項審定一最高標準價，一律遵守，非有特殊原因經呈准後，不得擅行加價，違者處一千元以下罰金，或一年以下徒刑。行政院又規定最高米價，產米區域，每擔不得過二十元，非產米區域，不得過三十元，是以奸商即欲心存居奇，尙有所顧忌而不敢爲。上海非不組織井然也，機關森然也，然以市面與民生論之，則在無政府狀態之中。於是奸商操縱，爲所欲爲。彼奸商之敢於操縱也，亦係由漸而加深、先之以嘗試，嘗試而得售其奸，則進一步，進一步而無有加以干涉，則更進一步；如是而其胆愈大，其勢愈張，其操縱愈力，其爲害也愈廣而愈酷；奸商可誅，然權威方面熟視無覩。不加干涉，亦不能不負其嚴重責任也。或謂奸商詭謀百出，倘加干涉，則又堂皇其辭明示反對，脅誘其間暗施破壞；反對不成，破壞無效，則又消極抵抗；故干涉亦屬徒然。然吾人未信奸商乃爲上海之主宰者！又未信上海各組織各機關之權威，竟不能行之於奸商！物必自腐，而後蟲生，奸商誠蠧蟲，顧非權威組織，權威機關不謀整飭之故哉！</p>
<p>有效之干涉，在制裁；制裁之先，務調查；調查之外，獎告發。竊以爲租界當局負租界重責，握租界大權，應超越奸商之範疇，直接調查眞相，在居民福利與界內治安之前提之下，以種種可能之方法，作直接間接之壓迫。以米而論；除調查存米數量，與每日到埠數量及其來價之外，應調查其囤積押款操縱等等情形，調查其經營之主名。罪惡在所必懲。於法未必能懲者，至少頻頻拘訉之。更於其營業居住生活有關之種種，予以不方便。發表之，不留其體面，最低度之目標，務使奸商不敢作食米之投機，務使不肯之金融業者不復爲奸商投機食米之後盾！</p>

<p>東京　外務省發言人今日在此間招待新聞記者時、美日關係復爲記者發問之主題、或問日本在開始重行調整日蘇雙方關係之磋商時、曾表示其「敏疾」、今何以不用此同樣之「敏疾」而與美國開始目的相同之談判歟、發言人答稱、日本切欲與各國維持善鄰關係、故若環境有利、即將開始談判、俾重行調整對美及其他外國之關係、此等談話並無孰先孰後之成見、美日間目前尙水進行締結兩國新商的之談判、當努力解決國際事件時、實有解決中國事件之必要、若雙方均切欲商取妥協、則何方發動自屬無關重要云、或以美日間在華有懸案約六百起相叩、發言人稱、日本從未忽視此等懸案、雖中國境內之大規模戰事、使兩國謀取解決發生嚴重困難、但美日外交家間關於此事之非正式談話刻在進行中、美日兩國之深謀遠慮者均切欲防止兩國局勢被最惡劣之不測事件所傷害云、或問日本是否準備於「中國新中央政府」成立後、對在華其他國家給予最惠國之待遇、發言人答稱、日本將完全尊重外國在華之利益、但一切均視發展而定云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　關於蘇聯與日本商訂商務條約事、據消息靈通人士所知、變方大約於十二月杪開始談判、日本方面會因該國駐蘇大使館並未派有商務專員、主張以東京爲談判地點、蘇聯方面則要求在莫斯科進行談判、迄至此際、日本聞已徇蘇聯之請、據蘇日兩國迄未訂有商務條約、此次談判倘能吿成、將爲第一次云（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>惟十一元至二十元、占百分之一四·六五、較願受這種報酬的百分比减少一倍、即較前年度亦見低落、二十一元至三十元亦係同等的情形、三十一元至四十元的百分比更見低落四十一元至五十元反占百分之二五·〇一、這種特異的情形、是因內地好幾個運輸公司需要大批司機人才所致、但是有此能力的求職者過少、所以應徵成功的不到百分之二、（詳表七和表十）、五十一元至六十元占百分之一·二二、六十一元至七十元占百分之三·六、七十一元以上的機會極少、合起來也不過百分之〇·六、佣金報酬的機會占總報酬百分之二二·四四、這種報酬全憑推銷能力而定、人數愈多對用人機關愈有益、可是求職者中自認有推銷能力的極少（詳表三）、這種報酬對於他們簡直不如十元以下的待遇、總起來說、用人方面所肯出的報酬、仍較求職者希望的報酬爲低、一方面可顯出孤島經濟衰落、一方面可以助證有些機會爲什麼沒有人就的情形、徵求人才最多的機會、仍是商業性質的、其中所任的職務、以推銷員最普遍、可是這種職務除少數給薪金外、大多按照佣金計算、願就而有推銷能力的人極少、因此這種機會多數錯過、其次是練習生、待遇也極低、通常祇供膳宿、略貼鞋襪錢而已、再其次是售貨員、管理員·店員簿記·會計·等機會、都业不很多、若與前年度比較、百分比大見减低、本年度占不到總機會百分之三十九、（前年度占百分之五九·六）、徵求人才次多數的機會、要論到交通運輸的、占百分之二九·五五、爲本年度新興的機會、詳細分列計有司機員、報務員和電合報吿員等、待遇較優、服務機關多是在內地、徵求工藝人才的機會、也有相當、如汽車修理·翻砂·鉗床·車床·編織等多種、敎育及文事人才、偏於中小學敎員、家庭敎師和文書方面、徵求工業和工程人才的機會、較前年度更稀、大規模的工業、已轉入內地、機會當然减少、</p>
<p>徵求人才報酬分類（表八）</p>
<p>供求對比</p>
<p>綜上所論巳可概見人才供求一般情形、求職的人數和求人的機會相差不大、似可相互適應、惟事實上、成就者如何、據表七表八的統計、求人的機會計有二〇二七、介紹成就者祇六三七、不及求人機會三分之一、若與求職的總人數相比更爲低微、有四分之一强、數目殊嫌過小、主要的原因、分析有三二是求職者學有專長的較少、機會的到來、不能適應、二是需求擔任的職務、不合求職者的需要、如推銷員和司機員等、三是用人方面所給的報酬過分壓低、較戰前一般的水準相差奚止二三倍、而所需的敎育程度和經騐、反過分的提高、供求不相應的情形、無怪其增多也、</p>
<p>介紹成功者性別分類（表九）</p>

<p>本棉交易、同行買賣、異常紛繁、同行購進美棉五百件、照塊角價結算、大都目標一致看好、原因謂本年生產旣不豐富、各路來源有限、二則美印棉市價格、在此戰爭時代、鬆落無望、所以廠方消費雖不興旺、而業中人進意、倍見濃厚、本日孟買電訊、頂測印棉將跌十羅比、然人心絲毫無影響、細絨棉局勢尙和緩、因美棉尙可購訂，惟粗絨棉向有餘姚棉、近以國府保藏資源、統制加厲、來滬杜絕、印棉塊角猛漲、劃算不通、於是火機通州粗絨兩項、遂形俏俐、售價乃邁步前進、比上日再漲二三元之譜、蘇北來源、到通花三百五十包、常陰沙六百九十七包、又北沙來四百八十四包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨為感謝節停市、但據某行來電、預測市價略漲三四磅音、印度棉市繼續猛漲不已、四五月份白洛區最高價竟達二百六十羅比、繼後因大部多頭獲利了結、市况因而轉疲、結果收盤價格連同預測跌落十四羅比、埃及則又漲四五十磅音、利物浦現貨漲十餘便士、遠期反跌落十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日申新廠又略有進胃、其原料仍以供紡二十支者爲主、同業間亦略有採辦、但俱爲長纖維者、日廠商對於美棉之進胃、則較華廠爲健、日有數千包之交易、茲將昨日棉市、以美匯八元四三七五折合送廠連稅價如下、</p>

<p>上日高漲之紗市、昨則復入盤旋之途、實以美棉停市、而孟買棉市連朝狂騰、已有回挫之象、來電預測今日之價、粗細棉價均將低落十羅比、於是人心又見鬆懈、買氣不及昔日之有勁、同時港帮需要雖屬不輟、然採辦都係零星交易、絕無躉批發展消息、因之漲力未能維持前進、祇以棉市鬆落無望、紗市基礎、常可鞏固耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、氣勢和緩、因外棉恐有回風、致買氣不旺、開價勿動、二十支雙馬價爲六百五十二元、與上日無軒輊、旋聞外匯變遷甚微、而廣帮對於二十支紗缺乏交易、惟十支粗紗胃口時時嘗試、故二十支雙馬稍形疲弱、跌三元、破五十元關、迨至收盤時、略見回好、查半日間各帮買去、統計一千六百八十五包、行情與上日參差不齊、廠方由統益開出二十三支大發二百包、價爲六百三十五元、德豐廠開出十七支金雙獅一百包、價爲五百九十五元、均現鈔價、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>

<p>洋米定價不肯鬆落、新交易已難接近、惟一連日粳秈米價一致下游、洋米現貨勢難站足、昨有洋米二千六百九十三包到滬、係太古公司湖南輪自香港運來、聞該項洋米、係北洋帮所採購、計二千四百四十包運烟台、二百五十包運威海衛、的下星期一轉船運往、</p>

<p>約翰阿煦勒著　譯自密　評論報</p>
<p>同盟社傳日軍在粵省東京灣登陸的首决消息，說這决行動的目的，祗在佔據北海與封銷該港的「自由中國」的對外貿易，稍後，當日軍自欽州區向內地進犯時，日方暗示將從南方進擾廣西，但就突調廣東西南部的日軍兵力，日軍陸上戰事的激烈程度和交通局勢察之，可見日軍是在追求着較日方所承認的更有遠大影響的目的。日軍似圖予華方以一種打擊，這種打擊的重要性，與侵佔廣州而截斷銜接「自由中國」與外界的重要交通綫之一相埒，日軍的眞正目的，似在阻斷龍州到邕寗的公路，如果可能，便佔據這公路。</p>
<p>本年早先幾月中，北海是「自由中國」最重要的出口港。北海運往香港的金屬和產物，較華南沿海其他口岸爲多，取道北海的輸入，也很可觀。但後來瀝洲島的日軍威脅增大，中國當局便將北海貿易，大多移往他港：尤其是廣州灣法國租借地的巴耶砲臺（Fort　Bayard）。再，中國當局疏散北海的一部份居民，毀壞港中的若干便利和設備，以及通往內地的多數道路，九月份北海的航運交通，已减至輪船六艘，共一一·二四九噸；而北海的對外貿易，也已减低出口品價値八三六·五三〇元，入口品價値六七·六八五金單位。九月份北海在「自由中國」的對外貿易中，出口祇佔百分之十，入口佔百分之一·五，取道北海輸入的戰具，近來已完全終止。</p>

<h3 id="c100">吃虧和便宜 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>「便宜即是吃虧，吃虧即是便宜」，眞是絕妙的偈言，其功用常常超過「空即是色，色即是空」以上。其實，愛便宜之心，人皆有之，求吃虧而不得，却是普天之下的大寃桶。眞要想便宜，而以吃虧爲大前提，自然是「好文章」；然而便宜世界上也是少的，由你避吃虧若讐寇，惟恐不及。要是有求便宜之志而無免吃虧之才，則所得者十九不如意，固不論「明」與「暗」否已。因此便發明了「吃虧便宜統一論」的哲學，提出了上面的口號。而阿Q就是如此這般的標準人物：自己給人打了，却說人家是自已底兒子。驟聽之下，非常可笑，繼而就也惕然，原來阿Q志願要的也是便宜，顧奈力不從心何！</p>
<p>吃虧和便宜在一般塲合本是相對的，我與對方爭衡之下，所得者不能相同；除非世上沒有爭衡那回事，然而這個世界還未產生呢。因之也不怕爭衡，以眼還眼，以牙還牙，倒是最好的抵銷，這「手術」祇有胆怯如阿Q者才不敢實行，雖然還自稱是老子。</p>
<p>但退一步言之，老子也不失有其一些的丯度，最可憾的却是自己做了人家的兒子去也以爲挺光榮，這眞不知從那裏說起。</p>
<p>這樣，「手術」也是「談呀勿要起談俚哉」，所倚賴的却是「傳染」，眞是輕而易舉得很。　如：你要說「革命」罷，可以舉出乾隆皇帝是海寗陳閣老的小兒子的例來，這不是比革命便利得多了？雖然乾隆皇帝自己做了「韃虜」的兒子，而以後滿淸皇帝身中的血球的的確確是陳閣老型的。噁，「吃虧就是便宜呀，！」</p>
<p>這個便宜我可開心得很。可是歷古以來更有吃虧的，但自然也更便宜，這也使我更開心—開心得太「可痛」（！）了。又譬如：昭君蜜斯王的和番。那眞太豈有此理！歷史的恥辱！恥辱！然而這裏就有「文章在」了。原來我如要編「婦女愛國史」時，木蘭列入第一個，蜜斯王便是第二名，「編年體」的說法，蜜斯王還是第一章呢；而元曲選之首的「漢宮秋」也因此就變成一部最好的國防（？）文學的作品。</p>
<p>自然，有些人是會憤憤然於漢元帝底「雄兵解甲而蜜斯和番」底消極的辦法的。在漢宮秋的「梅花酒」一闋中，看他一副可憐相：「他他他（即蜜斯王也）傷心辭漢主，我我我携手上河梁；他部從入窮荒，我鑾與返咸陽……過宮牆，遶迴廓；……近椒房，月昏黄；……夜生凉，泣寒　；綠紗窗，不思量。」但他底失戀由於蜜斯王底和番，而和番呢，國家却因之可以「維持」了。哈，「吃虧就是便宜呀！」我們正應該羨慕漢元帝有這樣的羅曼史而且非常愛國。</p>
<p>可是我也有些憤懣這「吃虧」，那自然是毛延壽底十惡不赦，而漢元帝除上述的「便宜」以外，似乎還不會請蜜斯王祖任「女間諜」的工作，像四十年代一般，有人派了蜜斯穿上軍裝到遼遠的戰塲上來做媚眼，因此更「積極的」了。</p>
<p>不過，這是漢元帝底失着，歷史上也沒提到，似不便硬要中華民國的老百姓來負担這憤懣，這正如不必拉光緒帝同爲漢族一樣。</p>
<p>這裏不得不提出的，那是：男子到外國去招駙馬爺，自然比和番「便宜」得多，宗法社會歷來如此，不然夏娃爲何是亞當底一枝背骨呢。雖然不免要跪在「老王爺」前喊聲「爸爸！」可是，你想，將來的天下……哈哈，你想，而且什麽還有現成的。</p>
<p>現在正可以提倡提倡了「搬歷史」的當然「不准」把皇帝變成「大總統」，但懂了這富於「××性」（？）的傳家之秘，大總統雖無福分，衣食本錢却因之而有着落了。</p>
<p>於是鄙人明天也要上美容院去了。</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>「掃蕩」山區的戰略，無疑地，完全失敗了，皖曲仍安如磐石。那麼，眼前最緊要的工作，倒不是調遣人馬，補充軍實，或者加强工事，而在怎樣搶運各種應該準備的東西；機器，糧秣，食　，布疋，紙張等等，全是久守的必需品，因爲武漢放棄，這些建設原料和經濟資料，也許會來源斷絕的，所以非有充分的貯藏，便不足應付未來的困難，使大別山脈的力量陷於削弱；換言之，根本的急務，乃是經濟第一，軍事反居次要。廖磊將軍說：「保衛江淮，就是屛蔽隴蜀；固大別山脈，亦即樹立將來反攻的基礎。」直到這位驍勇善戰的桂軍名將彌留的前夕，還諄諄地吿囑着袍澤，一些沒有動搖確定的信念，這是多麽使人認識皖西根據地的重要啊！</p>
<p>在殘秋消逝初冬來臨的季節，大別山褪下了碧綠的外衣，露出銅筋鐵骨的雄姿，老百姓都放掉他們的鏟刀和耜頭，參加着搶運的工作，逶迤曲折的山徑，和懸崖危坡的烏道中，都射出了「杭育杭育」的聲音，那麼動聽，那麽齊整，與溪邊的流水，峭壁的飛瀑，合成了不平常的節奏，不由你不感到人力的偉大。</p>
<p>「不累嗎？老鄕！」有人向身輕的伕子慰問地說。</p>
<p>「沒有的話！俺…」指着自己闊大的肩膀答道，「俺這上面，哼，你猜猜，能擱多少斤？」說着臉上浮起了驕矜的徵笑。</p>
<p>「八十斤？，九十斤也許挑得動吧？」</p>
<p>「一百二十斤！」少年伕子拉長了聲調說，「要是跑短路，還得加重些！」又補充了兩句。</p>
<p>糧秣和食鹽的數量，一天天增加起來，老百姓知道這是「莠命之源」，在徵發搬運的幾星期，以活躍的姿態，造成了空前的紀錄；且對於食鹽的搶運，尤其會鼓動他們的興趣，因爲曾經嘗過「圍勦」時的痛苦，寗願讓待割的禾稻倒在田裏，「這是俺們的白　。」大</p>
<p>「力量，多麽的偉大呀！」頭髮花白的朱佛定氏，感到滿意了。他是廣西大學的敎務長，而現在，却負荷着比任何伕子更重的重担，大別山脈潛伏的力量推動起來。</p>

<p>引言</p>
<p>這次語文展覽會」，引起了許多人對於語文的注意，在中國語文歷史上劃了一個新界錢。這裏我想講幾只有關語文的小故事，或有文學趣味，或有民族情緒，只有科學的不管。依據拉斯克（Rask），語文反映出各民族先史時期的文化活動，如宗敎，風俗，制度等；所以我希望我的「小故事」多注意這。</p>
<p>亞當在天堂</p>
<p>「聖經」是「書中之書」，我的「小故事」該由此講起。「太初有字」，太沒趣，擱在一邊。</p>
<p>「創始紀」第二章裏說，上帝七日內造了宇宙，再用塵土造了亞當。人類最早的語言是河名（河是文化的創造者），因爲天堂流出四條河最先有名：第一條呌畢松河，第二條奇虹河，第三條希岱開爾河，第四條優發拉底河。</p>
<p>亞當到了天堂，上帝敎他各種事物的名稱：「於是亞當呌各物，各物因以得名。」這是語言的開始，合之劍橋大學副校長萊德福（Lightfoot）正確（？）年表，的在紀元前四〇〇四年四月廿五日左右。</p>
<p>「亞當給一切畜類，飛禽，野獸以名字；但亞當找不到一個伴侶」。上帝憫之，造了夏娃。我想文學作品（文學）爲什麼老是講愛，大概源出於此（？）。</p>
<p>巴比爾塔</p>
<p>「創始紀」第十一章起首說：「那時世界上只有一種語言，「種說話。」人類逃出洪水，來至希那爾，想造一塔，頂通天堂。上帝看見大怒說：「去分散他們的語言，使他們彼此說話互不相通。」</p>
<p>因爲語言不通，要磚的拿不到磚，要石灰的人家給他一塊板，塔建造不成，從此人類分居地球各處，語言永久有了闋隔。</p>
<p>這個巴比爾塔實是人類語言的第一個悲劇，要是世界只有一種語言，人類的彼此接觸一定更趨密切，文化也一定更發達。柴門霍夫創造世界語，說不定受了這段故事的感動。</p>
<p>巴比爾塔底下幾層總是建築成的（後因久年不修而坍了吧），在那裏各民族語言還相通，由此推想，中國人在那時與英國人埃及人猶太人可以直接談話。「爸爸」與「媽媽」這兩句話在底下幾層講的，虧得沒有忘記，至今全世界還是一樣</p>

<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>更新舞台更新後之頭一批京角，趙金蓉梁　秋吳素秋三坤伶，已决第演罷，除金蓉暫擬在滬小住，韻秋業於日前返平外，目下尙在出演之吳素秋，演至二十七日期滿，接吳後隊之人馬，據更新舞台負責人吿已邀妥鄭冰如貫大元李洪春殷金振劉硯亭宋遇春張連昌等人，即將首途來滬，大的下月中旬可望與滬人相見。此批人馬或非滬人所熟悉，爰爲介紹如左：</p>
<p>鄭冰如　爲津沽著名之坤旦，在天津中國明星兩大戲院，懸頭牌甚久，冰如面目皎好，綽的多姿，扮相極美。</p>
<p>貫大大元　邇來論鬢生者，多以譯富英馬連良爲此中冠，實則能與譚馬一爭長短者，大有人在，鳳二（王鳳卿）已老，老慶（高慶）嗓敗，而貫大元之藝，固不在富英連良之下，第以臉上不如譚馬之靈活耳。大元且武工根基極佳，鬚生戲文武兼擅，無」不精，靠打戲如定軍山珠簾寨皆其傑作，打棍出箱之出箱，四郞探母出關之吊毛，打鼓駡曹之擊鼓，皆其絕活，且嗓音響亮，悅耳動聽，早年與程硯秋合作甚久，更曾隨梅蘭芳東渡扶桑。</p>

<p>舞團寫影　（五二）</p>
<h3 id="c105">媚眼 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 小田</p>
<p>媚眼，謂其眼之美妙動人，有以別於常眼也。或稱迷眼，謂其眼鋒足以使人迷惑失智，亦通。或謂應稱眉眼，夫眉眼人皆具有，眉屬常眉，眼屬常眼，無以標異，寗足以稱，或以古人有眉目傳情之說，若以簡筆出之，將傳情二字的去，所謂意到筆不到也，此說亦甚牽强。且現時摩登女子，春山多屬描繪，夫旣屬描繪，則其美醜，胥屬繪事之工拙，殊不能與天然之眼相提並論也</p>
<p>大都會之舞孃，有二媚眼。兪美麗大而媚，斜睨之頃，不笑似笑，不視似視。沈維英小而媚，平視亦含笑意，遠視允佳。其妹維美，長纔及肩，而眼神酷似乃姊，將來不知要傾倒　許登徒可稱曰小媚眼</p>
<p>遠東舞　陸芹貞，人稱眉眼大王，日前偶値之大都會，嫡係友人所　，因得請與偕舞，締觀之，實迷眼而非媚眼蓋其平視斜視，均鮮媚態，惟向人微合其眼，輔以淺笑，確具勾魂攝魄之力，聞其雖溷跡中級舞塲，而月入舞資，雖高級舞塲紅星不啻也。</p>
<p>大華胡燕燕，武進產，伴舞未久，猶帶鄉音，而聲譽雀起，幾欲頡頏陳曼麗，或謂其得力於眼媚，實則燕燕非媚眼，乃美目，蓋黑白分明，淸朗秀麗，非直視斜睨之流也。友人胖翁，珍愛之不啻明珠美玉，日前詣大華，彼姝久坐檯不下，胖翁百無聊賴，乃呼另一姬坐檯，彼姝始則含嗔，比去，忽回眸一笑，胖翁則目直視而神若定，另一友人曰，怎經她臨去秋波那一轉，怎不敎你魂靈兒飛向半天也。</p>

<h3 id="c106">乳鶯出谷 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“The　Under-Pup”</p>
<p>一個新人的崛起，或許是機會造成他的，但不能忽略了最主要的基本條件。葛璐麗琪安，這個十一歲的女孩子，在「乳鶯出谷」問世之後，她的名字是將繼續着狄安娜寳萍，深印在全世界影迷的腦中了。這自然是她能遇到環球公司提拔的好機會，可是，她有歌唱，騎馬，游泳等等的基本條件，才能完成道部「乳鶯出谷」，而且這些基本條件决定她將來有更大的發展。　據宜傳，葛璐麗琪安的歌唱，是高音的正宗。在我們「外行」聽來，覺得她的嗓音沒有狄安娜竇萍的「甜潤」，這也許是年齡關係，將來跟着年齡的增長，她的嗓音一定會變化的。她的演技，也覺得受秀蘭鄧波兒的影響很深，不過是早期的秀　鄧波兒，還能保存着兒童的天真活潑，這是葛璐　琪安的可愛之處。希望在她沒有「成人」之前，永遠保持兒童的本來面目。</p>
<p>「乳鶯出谷」的故事，當然也是爲了這位小演員而編製的，但採取「夏令兒童營」這題材使兒童們遇着活潑的集體生活，及組織「自治會」養成他們自治的精神，這是很有意義的。看着銀幕上成羣的孩子，都是那樣活潑可愛，我不禁感得我們的「童星」太拘謹了。所遺憾的是這故慕太瑣碎，把珍妮和茜茜麗拉奪取游泳冠軍的高潮都冲淡了。</p>
<p>華萊斯卓越的導演手腕却彌補了故事上的缺憾，每一書面，片段，都是活潑有趣之至。尤其是葛璐　琪安的祖父，和那位兒童營的音樂指揮，風趣的勾劃，使本片出色不少。這兩位演員的演技，也是值得我們注意的。對於葛璐　琪安，是充分地給予了演戲的機會，開始就以「特寫」鏡頭介紹她出塲，以後如車站送別；和茜茜麗拉的交惡；幫助珍妮奪獲游泳冠軍；接受祖父的勸吿，向茜茜麗拉道歉等，祇受過六個月訓練的葛璐麗琪安演來能有這樣的成績，證明她的前途未可限量。</p>
<p>南葛蕾和洛勃孔敏思祇是葛璐麗琪安的附庸，戲很少。演珍妮的那個女孩子（維及尼亞維特勒），也是個可造的童星。</p>

<p>Chongqing. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih gave a speech at the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China last night, stating in part that the strength and morale of China's resistance are now greatly enhanced compared to the beginning of the war. Therefore, China can continue to fight Japan for many years to come. As for Japan, due to the mistakes of its ruling military clique, its economic structure has been severely affected by the war. At the same time, the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has made Japan's policy towards China even more hesitant and directionless. All of these are beneficial to China.

<h3 id="e8">Sanction Speculation in Rice <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>In Shanghai recently, prices of everything have risen, especially rice, oil, firewood, and charcoal. This is all caused by the unscrupulous behavior of speculators, and also due to the failure of the concession authorities and social organizations to correct the situation. The population is said to be five million. To entrust the livelihood of five million people to the hands of speculative merchants is extremely dangerous. To knowingly allow this danger to persist without sanctioning it is something that is rare throughout history, except in today's Shanghai.</p>
<p>Among the five million residents, a small number are foreigners. Their income is either based on their national currency or calculated in legal tender with a separate exchange rate compensation. A small number are wealthy families, and a small number are highly paid. All of these are indifferent to the unreasonable rise in prices. However, for the vast majority of the working class, whose monthly income is mostly between twenty or thirty yuan to one hundred yuan, who can afford the high cost of rice? A family of several people who consume three or four sheng of rice a day, with a monthly income of thirty or forty yuan, can barely afford to buy rice. Besides rice, what will they use to pay for rent, clothing, oil, salt, vegetables, firewood, charcoal, and other essential daily expenses? Moreover, the lower the income, the greater the need for rice, as there is no other way to fill their stomachs. Therefore, in wartime, there are often special agencies to manage civilian food supplies, responsible for regulation and price stabilization to stabilize people's livelihood, with penalties for violators. Even in Chongqing, there is a Price Assessment Committee to determine a maximum standard price for rice, coal, and oil, which must be strictly followed. Price increases are not allowed without special permission. Violators are subject to fines of up to one thousand yuan or imprisonment of up to one year. Therefore, even if unscrupulous merchants want to hoard and speculate, they are afraid to do so. Shanghai is not without well-organized organizations and agencies, but in terms of the market and people's livelihood, it is in a state of anarchy. As a result, unscrupulous merchants manipulate the market as they please. The daring of these unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the market has gradually deepened. First, they try it out, and if they succeed in their trickery, they take another step. If there is no interference, they take another step. As a result, their courage grows, their power expands, their manipulation becomes stronger, and their harm becomes wider and more severe. Unscrupulous merchants are hateful, but the authorities turn a blind eye. They cannot escape their serious responsibility for failing to interfere. Some say that unscrupulous merchants have a hundred tricks up their sleeves. If interfered with, they will grandly oppose it, secretly threaten those in between, and sabotage it. If opposition fails and sabotage is ineffective, they will passively resist. Therefore, interference is futile. But we do not believe that unscrupulous merchants are the masters of Shanghai! Nor do we believe that the authority of Shanghai's various organizations and agencies cannot be exercised against unscrupulous merchants! Things must rot from within before insects can breed. Unscrupulous merchants are indeed vermin, but is it not because the authoritative organizations and agencies have failed to address the problem?</p>
<p>Effective interference lies in sanctions. Sanctions must be preceded by investigation. In addition to investigation, there should be rewards for reporting violations. We believe that the concession authorities bear a heavy responsibility and wield great power in the concession. They should transcend the realm of unscrupulous merchants, directly investigate the truth, and, under the premise of resident welfare and internal security, use all possible methods to exert direct and indirect pressure. With regard to rice, in addition to investigating the amount of rice in storage and the daily amount arriving in port and its purchase price, they should investigate the hoarding, mortgage, manipulation, and other situations, and investigate the names of the business owners. Crimes must be punished. If the law cannot punish them, at least detain and interrogate them frequently. Furthermore, take away all the conveniences of their business, residence, and life. Expose them without giving them face. The minimum goal is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from speculating in rice and to prevent financial institutions from supporting the speculation of unscrupulous merchants in rice!</p>

<p>Tokyo. At a reception for journalists held here today by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, US-Japan relations were again the subject of questions from reporters. When asked why Japan did not use the same "swiftness" it had shown in starting consultations to readjust relations with the Soviet Union to begin negotiations with the United States with the same objective, the spokesman replied that Japan was eager to maintain good neighborly relations with all countries. If conditions were favorable, it would begin negotiations to readjust relations with the United States and other foreign countries. There was no preconceived notion of which should come first. Negotiations between the United States and Japan to conclude a new commercial treaty are not currently underway. When striving to resolve international events, it is necessary to resolve the China incident. If both sides are keen to reach a compromise, it does not matter which side initiates the effort. When asked about the approximately six hundred pending cases involving the United States and Japan in China, the spokesman said that Japan had never ignored these cases. Although the large-scale war in China had made it extremely difficult for the two countries to find a solution, informal talks between US and Japanese diplomats on this matter are currently underway. Those with deep foresight in both the United States and Japan are eager to prevent the situation between the two countries from being harmed by the worst-case scenario. When asked whether Japan was prepared to grant most-favored-nation treatment to other countries in China after the establishment of a "new central government of China," the spokesman replied that Japan would fully respect foreign interests in China, but everything would depend on developments.

<p>Moscow. Regarding the conclusion of a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan, it is understood from well-informed sources that negotiations will begin around the end of December. Because the Japanese embassy in the Soviet Union does not have a commercial attache, Japan has proposed that the negotiations take place in Tokyo, while the Soviet Union has requested that the negotiations take place in Moscow. To date, Japan has reportedly acquiesced to the Soviet request. It is understood that the Soviet Union and Japan have not yet concluded a commercial treaty, and if these negotiations are successful, it will be the first time. (23rd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>London. The Manchester Guardian today published a letter from Hughes, a tutor of Chinese at Oxford University, which stated in part that the Far East is where Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have common interests. Since the interests of the three countries are now absolutely incompatible with the aims of Japanese imperialism, they should cooperate practically and provide practical assistance to China. In this way, the trust of the United States can be obtained, and the United States can also be induced to participate in this good work. Then, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can turn to Japan and make it understand the need for the four countries to come forward to mediate in order to establish an appropriate solution to China. Although in this solution, Japanese ambitious people will lose face, Japanese merchants can once again see the Chinese as rational people and still trade with those who are not unforgivable.

Chinese Vice Minister of Propaganda Dong Xianguang issued a statement today warning Senator Borah, a leader of the American isolationist faction, not to sacrifice American principles for "blood money" by refusing to abandon trade relations with Japan. "The Chinese people hope that Borah will not overemphasize commerce and profit and sacrifice the principles that the American government has always valued. In today's world, unless democratic countries, under the leadership of the United States, adhere to their principles of collective security against aggression, there will be a catastrophe even greater than today's.

<h3 id="e16">This Year's Higher Civil Service Examinations; Examinees' Performance Ordinary; National Language Skills Poor, Thinking Unclear; Reduce Admission Standards to Show Flexibility <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. The results of the wartime Higher Civil Service Examinations have been released. The reporter believes that this year's Higher Civil Service Examinations have been changed to preliminary examinations and re-examinations, and training has been added, which is a pioneering initiative. It is of great importance to the country to encourage talent and assist in the future of national construction. The reporter specially visited Shen Shiyuan, Deputy Chairman of the Examination Committee, to ask for his impressions of this examination. According to his statement, although there were occasional good papers, in general, the quality was very ordinary. For example, national language skills were extremely poor, thinking was unclear, and there were many unexpected jokes in the history and geography of our country. There was also a lack of specialized research on the teachings of the President. Other subjects also inevitably had flaws. The reason for this may be due to the relocation of schools and the fact that examinees were running around in displacement and were unable to purchase reference books. The situation was not without its special circumstances. However, learning is not achieved in a day, and the teachings of the President are the foundation of learning and being a person. To be a Chinese person and to be ignorant of common questions about the history and geography of our country is a matter of great concern for cultural progress and national self-awareness. This examination has made it even more apparent that secondary education in the past has been messy and impractical, and university education has been focused on novelty rather than nurturing the fundamentals. It seems that there is a need for revision and correction. In addition, advanced intellectuals should be strict in guiding young people and should not follow the popular trend and forget their roots. If the fundamentals are neglected, even if one has a specialty to be commended, it will not be enough to win the selection of national talent. According to the original evaluation results of this examination, the number of people passing each category was only more than twenty. After consultation with President Dai, the admission standards were lowered, and those with a total average score of 50 or more were given additional points during the review. After reporting to the Examination Committee, a total of 143 people passed. There were no outstanding grades on the entire list. It is estimated that 11 out of every 100 candidates were admitted, which is a higher ratio than in previous Higher Civil Service Examinations. This shows that the evaluation of grades is based on standards, and the admission is intended to show encouragement and progress, and its intention is very profound. President Dai, based on the aim of cherishing young people and broadly planning their future, selected more than 100 people with a score of 45 or more as alternates. The training and future employment methods will be stipulated separately. I personally hope that the students admitted this time will be aware of the inadequacy of their learning, understand the difficulty of the national situation, and work hard to improve their moral character and learning during the training, and strive to repay the country, and that they will have good results in the next re-examination.

<p>Chongqing: The Accounting Department was established in April of the 20th year of the Republic of China. It is in charge of national budget, accounting, and statistical affairs. Accounting and statistical departments are established within various central government agencies and their subordinate agencies, according to their business needs and in order of urgency. Local governments, such as the provinces of Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Gansu, and Anhui, and the city of Chongqing, also have accounting departments to promote accounting policies. Over the years, important work areas of the department have included the preparation of the national general budget and final accounts, central accounting reports, statistical reports, and the review and compilation of local government budgets. Currently, the department is preparing to hold a national accounting conference to assess the actual progress of the affairs managed by the accounting and statistical departments under its jurisdiction. A preparatory meeting was held on the 24th. It is reported that more than 70 people involved in accounting administration from major central government agencies, provincial and municipal governments will participate in the conference. There are also many proposals to promote a transcendent accounting system. (24th dispatch)</p>

<p>The Hague: German sources are said to have told reporters from neutral country newspapers stationed in Berlin that "We will intensify mine warfare to retaliate against Britain's blockade of German export trade. Germany will lay mines along the British coast. This action does not violate international law. The Hague Convention prohibits the laying of mines in shipping lanes and enemy ports, but the British government has armed merchant ships and uses warships to escort them, making these ports into war zones." (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: The "German Foreign Policy Review" advises neutral countries to stay away from combat areas in the future. As the mouthpiece of the German government, this warning to neutral countries indicates that Germany intends to take retaliatory actions to strengthen its blockade measures against Britain. (24th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: The "German General Review" published a lengthy article detailing the military weaknesses of Britain, saying that Britain is surrounded by the sea, and all trade must pass through the sea. Even if Britain takes the measure of warships escorting merchant ships, it still cannot provide adequate protection. Britain has always spent huge sums to build a large navy. In times of war, if a strong enemy fights on the sea, Britain can use its large number of warships to subdue the enemy. However, the situation is different today. Naval warfare has new weapons to adapt to the situation, compete in wisdom, and show ingenuity. Even though Britain has many warships, it can do nothing. (24th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon declared in the House of Commons yesterday that Germany's "secret placement of magnetic mines" in British waters constitutes a new crisis, and that the British government will use all means to prevent it. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: It is now learned that several German aircraft flying low over the Thames Estuary on Wednesday night dropped mines by parachute. It is also reported that German seaplanes flying along the east coast of Britain are engaged in laying magnetic mines. According to opinions in the shipping industry, the recent repeated losses of ships must be due to this. Observers reported seeing objects falling from enemy aircraft into the sea, and once saw a German seaplane stopping on the sea, observing its function, which was clearly to lay mines or to have contact with German submarines. It is reported that Germany now has a type of seaplane with special equipment that can carry light mines with very strong explosive power. A floating mine was recently discovered near the Thames Estuary, which was detonated by the British using a rifle. It is reported that experts here predict that Britain also has powerful weapons to counter this. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>

In addition, the British fishing boat "Surbain" (387 tons) was also shelled and sunk by a German submarine in the Scottish sea on the 21st of this month. Only seven of the twelve crew members were rescued. (21st, 22nd Havas dispatch)</p>

(24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The Dutch government has negotiated with the British government to oppose Britain's commercial retaliatory actions against German mine warfare. The Dutch ambassador to Britain stated to the British Foreign Office yesterday that the retaliatory measures proposed by Britain would cause special harm to neutral countries that receive or transport German goods. Responsible parties in London commented that the Dutch action was unexpected because the Netherlands did not say a word about the German plan to cause greater damage to neutral country shipping, but only disagreed with the British action that was purely limited to German goods. Churchill's "The World Crisis" mentions the same method in the last war, saying, "What neutral countries should recognize is that it is impossible and not for the benefit of neutral countries to maintain a situation in which, on the one hand, they want to maintain the various rights of exploitable naval powers, and on the other hand, they allow naval weak countries to abuse their power. The above situation is especially applicable today, because neutral country trade has been greatly damaged as a result of German mine warfare. This British action is just its response. The wider the scope of Germany's ability to support the war, the greater the losses suffered by neutral country ships and sailors. The Allied retaliation is appropriate to shorten the time for German political destruction of world trade. The German government must have anticipated that the British government would stop the transportation of German goods on the high seas, but the British government, in order to take care of the interests of neutral countries, was forced to do so only today. Responsible parties here also said that Germany's propaganda on the North Sea mine laying is inconsistent. Four kinds of propaganda were issued at the same time, such as (1) the mines were laid by the British; (2) the ship sinking incidents in the past few days were German naval victories; (3) even if the mines were laid by the German side, international law allows mine laying to control enemy ships, and there is no need to announce it when military needs require it; (4) severely damage the enemy at key points on overseas shipping lanes. This is Germany's goal in the war. As for how mines can distinguish enemy ships from neutral ships in overseas shipping lanes, German propaganda has never explained it." (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels: The Belgian government has decided to negotiate with Britain and France to oppose their retaliatory actions against German mine warfare. The newspapers of the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party in Belgium commented on the British decision, believing that the countermeasures against German naval warfare methods were not blameworthy, but the Catholic Party newspapers did not comment. The Socialist Party newspaper published in Ghent said that protests from neutral countries to the British government were inevitable, but protests should also be made against German naval warfare methods. The Belgian Labour Party newspaper "The People" said that no one can deny that the war makes neutral countries feel inconvenient, but Britain has not sunk neutral country ships or abandoned their passengers and crew at sea to float or sink.

<h3 id="e23">The "Terukuni Maru" Ship Sinking Incident; Which Country Should Be Held Responsible; A Thorough Investigation is Still Pending <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that the Japanese government cannot say for sure what kind of action it will take regarding the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru." It was clear that the ship struck a moored mine. Because the accident happened in broad daylight and the weather was clear with good visibility, if it were a floating mine, it would have been visible from two miles away. Smaller ships had passed through the area before the "Terukuni Maru" and did not encounter any misfortune. The Japanese ship weighed more than 12,000 tons and had a deeper draft, so it suffered this disaster. Therefore, it can be determined that it must be a moored mine. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the government is now meticulously collecting all information and other necessary materials so that the responsibility for this unfortunate incident can be determined. If the Japanese government blames Germany, it would be tantamount to accusing Germany of indiscriminately using mine warfare against ships of neutral countries. If the government attributes the responsibility for this matter to Britain, it would be tantamount to accusing Britain of laying mines outside designated areas in order to obstruct the commerce of neutral countries. The result of the Japanese government's investigation will be one of the two. It is equivalent to issuing a declaration to please one belligerent country and offend the other. This could lead to Japan being drawn into the vortex of war, even though it has declared its non-intervention in the European war. The newspaper ended by saying that the Cabinet meeting will mention the responsibility for the sinking of the "Terukuni Maru" and will also maintain close contact with other neutral countries, especially Italy.

<p>London: The British Air Ministry issued a communiqué stating that the British Air Force in France shot down seven enemy aircraft on Thursday. There were no casualties among British Air Force personnel, but two aircraft were damaged. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters reporter with the British Air Force on the Western Front cabled that seven British aircraft pilots shot down seven German aircraft in air battles on the Western Front yesterday. The British Air Force Command in France has confirmed that four German Dornier twin-engine monoplane bombers were shot down southeast of Fécamp, and another three crashed near Châlons, Saint-Avold, and Spincourt in the Meuse River area. It is still awaiting confirmation whether one of them was lost with us. It is generally believed that the aircraft crashed behind the German front line. The circumstances of the downed German aircraft found are as follows: British machine gun fire forced a Dornier aircraft to descend near Fécamp. The German pilot landed the aircraft straight into a deep gorge. After landing, the pilot and observer exited the aircraft and dragged out a severely injured gunner. A local villager ran across the fields with only a cane, wanting to prevent them from burning the aircraft, but the observer pointed a pistol at him, making it impossible. The pilot was then able to set the aircraft on fire. Another German aircraft crashed near Châlons, about 20 miles from the air combat site. However, there was only a pilot in the aircraft, and he was not injured. He has now been captured. The other two crew members jumped out with parachutes, one dead and one injured. Another aircraft was found ten miles outside the air combat site. Its machine gun was destroyed. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: The news that eight German aircraft were shot down when a German aircraft group attacked a certain place in France has been completely confirmed. The responsible authorities have carefully inspected the enemy aircraft that crashed within the territory, which does match the number of eight. The surviving enemy pilots have all been captured. The German aircraft that came to attack this time were of two types. One is the Dornier 17, which has a maximum speed of 440 kilometers per hour, can carry 1,200 kilograms of bombs, and can climb to an altitude of 7,000 meters. The aircraft is also equipped with a camera. Once the authorities develop the film, they can determine what mission each of these aircraft was carrying out. The other is the Heinkel, which has a maximum speed of 456 kilometers per hour, can carry 3,000 kilograms of bombs, and can climb to an altitude of 8,000 meters. The aircraft is also equipped with three machine guns. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>

The Air Force continued to fly reconnaissance missions into French airspace, and many air battles occurred. A British aircraft was shot down near Verdun, and another was shot down near Saarbrücken. German anti-aircraft guns also shot down a French aircraft near Zweibrücken. In addition, according to the captain of a German submarine, a British cruiser was hit by a German submarine in the Firth of Forth and has been severely damaged. (24th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: According to news here today, another German submarine was sunk by a French ship. A French survey ship glimpsed a torpedo coming through the sea under the moonlight, so it quickly turned its wheels to avoid it and rushed towards the German submarine at maximum speed, dropping depth charges. The submarine never rose again. Including this one, French fleets have sunk three German submarines in recent days. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued a war report yesterday stating that a French destroyer had sunk two German submarines in the past three days. The Navy Department also issued a communiqué today detailing the events. A French seaplane discovered a German submarine on the surface of the sea somewhere. The submarine immediately sank into the water, and the aircraft dropped a buoy where it sank and notified the ships patrolling the sea in the area. The destroyer "Sirocco No. 1" (1,500 tons) rushed to the scene after hearing the news and dropped two batches of underwater bombs at the location of the buoy. Before long, the German submarine was seen floating up, its hull extremely tilted. After ten seconds, it sank. Three days later, the "Sirocco" was patrolling the same area at night and spotted a German submarine sailing on the surface of the sea in the hazy moonlight. It immediately opened fire on it. After the submarine sank, it dropped multiple underwater bombs. The German submarine floated up once and sank in an instant, and oil stains floated up. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin: Regarding the German submarine hitting the British cruiser "Belfast" in the Firth of Forth in Scotland, the German News Agency commented today that on the 22nd of this month, several American news agencies and the New York Times published news of the German submarine hitting a British cruiser. The news came from London, and there is no doubt that the British Admiralty knew about it. However, since reporters from neutral countries have learned about it from authoritative sources, why hasn't the Admiralty officially announced it? The German News Agency also said, "The 'Belfast' is a newly built warship, having only served for three months, and is equipped with the latest anti-torpedo devices. The anchorage is also strictly protected by mine nets and special observation posts on the coast." (24th Huitong dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Border Kidnapping Incident: Netherlands Protests to Germany, Calling it a Violation of Territory; The Munich Case Remains a Mystery <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Hague: Regarding the kidnapping of two British nationals, Best and Stevens, by Germans in the Dutch border town of Venlo, the Dutch government has sent a note to Germany protesting the violation of territory. The German government has also responded. It is generally believed here that this case could seriously affect relations between the Netherlands and Germany. The "Commercial Gazette" reports that two Dutch citizens were also abducted along with Best and Stevens. According to German political police, one of them is a Dutch army lieutenant named Klop. Although his identity card had a photo, he used more than one name. From this statement, it can be seen that the German political police are falsely accusing these Dutch citizens of being involved in British espionage. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the bombing in Munich, Germany, news was released yesterday stating that two British spies, Best and Stevens, were involved and had been arrested. In fact, these men were abducted by Germans in the Dutch border town of Venlo (near the German border) on the 9th of last month and have since been held in Berlin. As for the so-called principal offender, Elser, he has been detained in the Dachau concentration camp since 1937. He was released to the Swiss border only a week ago, but was immediately arrested again and accused of being the principal offender in the Munich bombing, which was then heavily publicized. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>London: According to news from the German-Hungarian border from high-ranking National Socialist Party organs, the German government claims that Elser, who confessed to receiving money from the British intelligence service to plant a bomb in a Munich beer cellar, was still imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp a week ago. He and another prisoner were taken to the Swiss border, but after reaching the border, they were taken back to Munich. Then, the Germans widely announced in newspapers that the main culprit in the beer cellar bombing had been arrested. The person who was taken to the border with Elser and then back to Munich was named Büchelrz. It is likely that this person will be one of the figures in the case when Elser is prosecuted. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: Regarding the shooting incident involving a Dutch car near Venlo on the German-Dutch border on October 9th, a semi-official statement has just been issued. It stated that there were two British people in the Dutch car, who presented credentials indicating that they had permission to contact Germans to explore the possibility of peace negotiations. Because the Netherlands maintained neutrality, the Dutch authorities sent a Dutch military officer to accompany the British to monitor them. According to Dutch sources, when the car stopped at the border and the two passengers got out, they were suddenly shot at by six people. As a result, one person was killed and one seriously injured. Then, a car came from German territory, pulling the Dutch car, the two wounded men, and everyone else in the car into German territory. The "Dian Wen Bao" stated the main points of the matter, saying, "This happened in Dutch territory, which is beyond doubt. The person who carried out the sniper attack left behind a handgun, bullets, blood stains, and footprints. These Germans are in fact undermining Dutch neutrality and committing crimes punishable by severe penalties under Dutch law. It is a fact that two Dutch and two foreign nationals were abducted from Dutch territory into German territory. At least one of them has been killed in Dutch territory." Reuters has learned that after this incident, well-informed sources here believe that one of the two British men who has been killed is Captain Stevens. It remains to be seen how the Germans will handle his interrogation. It is noted that Captain Stevens was the head of the passport office at the British consulate and had traveled to Venlo a few months ago to handle German immigration matters. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The official here announced last night a statement disclosing the activities of the British intelligence service. It briefly stated that from November 1937 to 1938, the British intelligence service carried out sabotage operations against many ships, damaging several ships and injuring crew members. The damaged ships included those of Germany, Italy, and Japan. According to Captain Stevens' report and German official investigations, the following facts have now been discovered: the main perpetrator of the ship sabotage was the German exile Pottush, and the instigator was the British intelligence service. Pottush was arrested in December 1938 after German police officers made a request to police officers in a neutral country, but he was released after British authorities intervened in the case. At that time, Pottush had already been detained because the Danzig court had sentenced him to imprisonment on June 29, 1939, for being a British spy. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>

<p>Bucharest: After the Ajegeanu cabinet resigned yesterday, former Ambassador to France Tatarescu formed a new cabinet within a few hours. The new cabinet members were sworn in to King Carol II at an imperial conference in the afternoon of the same day. From 1933 to 1937, Tatarescu repeatedly served as cabinet minister and prime minister, as well as serving as a royal advisor and ambassador to France.

<p>Bucharest: King Carol of Romania ordered former Prime Minister Tatarescu to organize a new cabinet to succeed Ajegeanu, who resigned yesterday. It is expected that Tatarescu's cabinet formation work will be completed today. In addition to members of his own Liberal Party, the cabinet will include members of other parties. It is generally believed that Tatarescu's cabinet formation is to ensure Romania's neutrality and a strong policy of independence. During the recent trade negotiations between Germany and Romania, the suggestions put forward by the German side, regardless of Germany's demands to obtain exclusive rights to Romania's exports, may not be accepted by Tatarescu now that he is in power. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian Ajegeanu cabinet resigned yesterday after disagreements arose following the arrival of a German trade delegation in Bucharest. Former Prime Minister Tatarescu has now formed a new cabinet. Tatarescu is the leader of the National Liberal Party, which is composed of conservatives and nationalists. Under the leadership of the late Bratianu from 1919 to 1928, the party held the highest political power. During the last World War, the party supported the Allied countries and opposed the neutral policy of Prime Minister Machiloman. The downfall of the Ajegeanu cabinet was triggered by the resignation of the Minister of National Economy, Butzoyu. Butzoyu discovered that the German trade methods and demands were incompatible with Romania's current foreign trade system, so he requested the government to adopt a new system that would benefit the people. The government refused to accept it, and Butzoyu resigned. It is heard that the German delegation gained very little from this trip and has now returned to Berlin. (Reuters News Agency, 24th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: National Government Committee member Zhangjia Hutuktu is the only surviving religious leader among the four major Mongolian-Tibetan religious leaders (the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and Jebtsundamba Khutuktu have all passed away). He enjoys the faith and worship of Mongolian officials and civilians. After the start of the "August 13th" Chinese National Self-Defense War, the Living Buddha resolutely left Mount Wutai for Beijing, then from Beijing to Hankou to Chongqing to Chengdu, always expressing solidarity with the country. The movable property, Buddhist implements, and Buddhist implements stored over the generations in the major temples under the jurisdiction of the Living Buddha in Rehe, Duolun, Beiping, and Mount Wutai have suffered losses of no less than millions, but the Living Buddha does not care about this. This time, he came to Chongqing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and, concerned about the hardships of the soldiers fighting on the front lines, he will donate 10,000 yuan to comfort them, as a sign of respect. The soldiers on the front lines will surely be encouraged by this news, and Mongolian and Tibetan officials and civilians will also be inspired to unite more strongly. The impact will not only be this material encouragement. The Living Buddha flew back to Chengdu the morning before yesterday. (News Agency, 24th)</p>

<p>Changyinsha Correspondence: The southeast township area of the county is guarded by the Chinese army's Yuan unit. The Japanese army has repeatedly attacked, but has ultimately been unsuccessful. A month ago, after the Zhizi-Nebu unit suffered heavy losses in the Zhutang area, it wanted to retaliate. On the 14th of this month, it joined forces with the Wu Teng and Sanzhai units, dividing into three routes—east, south, and west—under the command of Tanaka, intending to surround Guonan Township. However, the Chinese army was already prepared. A fierce battle broke out in Huashi Shayang. The Japanese army used airplanes to drop dozens of small bombs in Houteng Yangku, killing and wounding more than ten people and destroying several civilian houses. On the 15th and 16th, the Chinese and Japanese armies were still in a stalemate in the southeast township. The Japanese army's purpose in occupying the southeast township was to collect land taxes, but it was resisted by the Chinese army, and it became just a dream.</p>

<p>Chengdu Aviation News: At noon on November 4th, 54 Japanese airplanes, divided into two batches, attacked Chengdu. The Chinese Air Force's Divine Eagle Team heard the alarm and immediately took off to intercept them. A fierce battle broke out in the northern suburbs of the city. After blindly dropping bombs in the wilderness, the Japanese airplanes fled in panic. The Chinese Air Force squadron pursued them fiercely, first destroying the leading airplane of the second batch of 27 Japanese airplanes, and then hitting many more Japanese airplanes, achieving a great victory and returning safely. Apart from Squadron Leader Cen suffering minor injuries, everyone else was safe. According to reports from the air defense observation posts, 18 Japanese airplanes did not leave Sichuan that day. Three Japanese airplane wreckage were found, but the rest have not yet been discovered. Colonel Okuda, known as the "King of Bombing" in the Japanese Air Force, came to China this spring and repeatedly led Japanese airplanes to bomb Liangshan, Chongqing, and Chengdu. This time, he was killed by the Chinese Air Force. As for the Japanese airplane wreckage and captured Japanese Air Force personnel that have been found, they were transported to Chengdu on the 9th and are being exhibited in Shaocheng Park. The battle situation of the 4th is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Air Combat Situation</p>
<p>On the morning of November 4th, the continuous rain had just cleared, and the autumn sky was exceptionally clear. At 9:08 AM, the air defense observation post suddenly issued an advance warning that 54 Japanese airplanes, divided into two large formations, each with 27 airplanes, had invaded Sichuan territory from the northeast of Sichuan. At 10:00 AM, the Japanese airplanes reached [illegible], and Chengdu also issued an air raid alarm. At this time, all the citizens of the city had completely taken refuge in safe places. Aviation Committee Director Zhou Zhirou and Air Defense Commander Deng Xihou went to a certain place to command the Chinese Air Force and the警戒 units to prepare for battle. At 10:40 AM, the emergency alarm was issued. The Chinese Air Force [illegible] unit had already taken off and formed a formation at an altitude of 10,000 feet, waiting in strict formation. At 11:00 AM, the first batch of Japanese airplanes, due to the brave charge of the Chinese Air Force, could not sneak into the city air and blindly dropped bombs in the suburbs of a small county near Chengdu before fleeing in panic. The second batch of 27 Japanese airplanes took the opportunity to sneak into the suburbs of Chengdu. The Chinese Divine Eagle Team had already seen them and immediately launched a fierce attack, surrounding them from all sides. Another Divine Eagle suddenly pounced into the Japanese airplane formation from high altitude and then turned to shoot at the left and right sides of the Japanese team. The battle was extremely fierce, and the Japanese airplane's ladder-shaped formation was disrupted, so they dared not linger and fled east in panic. The Chinese ground air defense anti-aircraft guns also spewed out angry flames to bombard the Japanese airplanes. The Chinese Air Force pursued even more bravely until a considerable distance before returning safely. At 12:05 PM, the alarm was lifted.</p>
<p>Japanese Airplane Crashes into River</p>
<p>When the first batch of Japanese airplanes attacked Chengdu, the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery team fired all their guns, hitting a Japanese airplane. The fuel tank caught fire and fell near Zhonghechang in Huayang County. Another airplane fell at Yuantong Temple at the junction of Huayang and Renshou Counties. In addition, two more Japanese airplanes destroyed by the Chinese Air Force crashed. One crashed at Guanyin Temple in Renshou County, and the other crashed in Jianyang. When the second batch of Japanese airplanes fled east, their leading airplane was shot down by the Chinese Air Force. The wreckage of the airplane crashed in the territory of Zhongjiang County. The fuselage was completely destroyed, and the seven aviation officers and soldiers on board were all burned to death. Only four machine guns and several pistols were left. There were also several Japanese Air Force personnel captured from the Japanese airplane that crashed in Renshou.</p>
<p>King of Bombing</p>
<p>Documents found on the bodies of the Japanese Air Force personnel proved that one of them was Colonel Okuda. According to the Japanese, the four great kings of fighter planes were Bai Xiangdingnan, Chaotian Liangping, Limoto Minjing, and Southwest Township Maoshang. From the Shanghai-Nanjing Battle to the Wuhan Battle, all have been wiped out by the Chinese Air Force. This last surviving Okuda, Kikuwara Colonel, is known as the "King of Bombing" in the Japanese Air Force. He came to China this spring and led teams to bomb Chongqing, Chengdu, Liangshan, and other places. Chengdu suffered a brutal bombing on June 2nd, which was also led by Okuda. This time, he was shot down, and the people of Chengdu all celebrated and rejoiced. Furthermore, from the wreckage of the Japanese airplane, it was identified as being manufactured in August of the Showa 14th year (1928 of the Republic of China), which further proves the great achievements of the Chinese Air Force's resistance war over the past three years. Not only have the Japanese Air Force personnel suffered heavy casualties, but the Japanese airplanes have also been exhausted. Okuda was 44 years old and the commander of the Japanese Naval Air Force. He was appointed as a second lieutenant candidate in the Taisho 3rd year and promoted to second lieutenant the following year. He was appointed as a major in the Taisho 15th year and promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Showa 6th year and colonel in the 12th year. He served as the chief of the first section of the general affairs department of the naval aviation department of the naval headquarters and as a member of the technical conference, and other important positions.</p>
<p>Casualty Investigation</p>
<p>When the Japanese airplanes invaded the suburbs of Chengdu, they were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese Air Force and were unable to invade the city air. They blindly dropped many bombs in the suburbs of [illegible] and [illegible], destroying dozens of thatched houses and killing and wounding a dozen civilians. In addition, in the suburbs of a certain small county near Chengdu, they dropped many bombs at [illegible] and other places, destroying several thatched houses. The rest landed in the wilderness. Several civilians were injured by stray bullets outside the New East Gate. After the alarm was lifted, the Provincial Capital Air Raid Emergency Relief Office immediately dispatched a survey team led by team leader Sun Qunyi to rush to the bombed areas to investigate, and the rescue team and stretcher team were dispatched separately for rescue.</p>
<p>All Sectors Comfort the Troops</p>
<p>The news of the great victory in the air battle spread, and the citizens were overjoyed. On the morning of the 5th, people from all walks of life sent representatives carrying flowers, food, and banners to the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery team's bases to comfort them separately. They also cheered and celebrated the victory of the Chinese Air Force along the way. The Sichuan Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Sichuan Provincial Mobilization Committee's Rural Service Group also sent representatives with flowers to comfort them on the afternoon of the 6th. Deputy Squadron Leader Wang of the [illegible] Squadron of the 4th Air Battle introduced the officers and soldiers of the air battle on that day to meet, and squadron leaders Xie Ma described the detailed process of defeating the Japanese airplanes on that day. The representatives warmly comforted the officers and soldiers who participated in the battle and wished them good health. In the afternoon, they sent personnel to Renji Hospital to comfort Squadron Leader Cen, who was injured in the air battle that day. Furthermore, people from all walks of life in Chengdu held a grand ceremony to comfort the Air Force and present flags on the 10th. In the afternoon, party, government, and military agencies in the Sichuan provincial capital also sent representatives to comfort the Air Force.</p>
<p>Squadron Leader Interview</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on the 6th, the reporter visited Squadron Leader Cen at Renji Hospital. At that time, a foreign doctor was examining his scars. His spirits were very high. He then talked about the battle on the 4th and the injuries he sustained. He said, "After we received intelligence that enemy airplanes were attacking Chengdu that day, we immediately took off to警戒. When the team of airplanes I was leading had been airborne for 35 minutes, we encountered the enemy airplanes. Before the enemy airplanes had even begun to drop bombs, I directed my wingmen to launch a fierce attack on the enemy in the city air. Because the enemy airplanes' firepower was very dense, when I carried out several surprise attacks and the enemy airplanes were about to flee, my airplane unexpectedly had a small problem. Immediately, I smelled a foul odor surrounding me. I knew that if I persisted any longer, I would be forced to land, so I flew the airplane back. When approaching the airfield, I was forced to land. Fortunately, I was only slightly injured in the 機身, and the skin under my right eye was slightly injured, but it's not serious." Squadron Leader Cen is 28 years old this year, from Enping County, Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he has participated in the Air Force. He has participated in the Shanghai, Poking, Hankou, and recent Chongqing and Lanzhou battles. (November 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Suzhou Rice Prices Soar: Japanese Control Outbound Shipments, Rice Merchants Hoard for High Prices <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese Special Service Unit in Suzhou City, under the guise of "adjusting agricultural products," established a materials exchange and controlled food supplies. Due to soaring rice prices, they once strictly prohibited it, allowing farmers to freely transport and sell their rice. However, recently, due to too many "absorbing households" in the city, such as Longmao outside Qimen, which alone imported over two thousand piculs, and other firms like Sanfeng, Zhaoyuan, Xiechang, and Yuanda, which also imported large quantities, market prices have skyrocketed. High-quality winter rice is priced at 24.6 yuan, old winter rice at 24.3 yuan, second-grade winter rice at 24 yuan, old high-quality white rice at 24.2 yuan, new high-quality white rice at 24 yuan, new second-grade rice at 23.7 yuan, new medium-grade indica rice at 24 yuan, and new fragrant pearl rice at 14.7 yuan. High-quality white rice is priced at 26.6 yuan. The reason for the soaring rice prices is that farmers in rice-producing areas who want to transport rice out are being intercepted by guerrillas and not allowed to do so. Rice merchants, seeing the high rice prices in Shanghai, believe that they can still profit by transporting rice from Suzhou. Some obtain export permits under Japanese merchant banners to transport Suzhou rice to Shanghai. Now, Guangshu, the director of the Japanese Special Service Agency's management department, has banned rice exports, while still subjecting it to the control of the materials exchange. Therefore, the amount of rice transported to Shanghai has decreased sharply in recent days.</p>

<p>Funing Communication: After Funing fell this spring, the Japanese army used Zhu Baoyuan and over a hundred others as guides, disturbing various towns and villages in the surrounding areas. Yesterday, eight Japanese soldiers, along with Zhu and others, went to the Haligang area in Dongxiang, attempting to suppress the Chinese army. However, Zhu, unable to endure the usual oppression by the Japanese army, seized the opportunity to take over a hundred rifles and several heavy and light machine guns. Upon arriving at the port, they immediately revolted, killing all eight Japanese soldiers. They then took the weapons and contacted Huang Gongzheng, the battalion commander of the county's regular army, to cooperate. County Magistrate Xiong Yanghe then appointed Zhu as a battalion commander. The Japanese army stationed in Chenjiayang Tongyang Port, upon hearing this, were furious and burned down most of the civilian houses in the town and along the riverbanks in Liutang and other places. When they tried to return to the city, they were intercepted by the Chinese army and retreated to Hexing Town. Yesterday, they retreated to the estuary of Sheyang Lake. The Japanese army in Funing City is now quite panicked.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Shanghai: A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (V) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie</p>
<p>Only 14.65% of jobs offer 11 to 20 yuan, less than half of those seeking such pay, and lower than the previous year. The same is true for 21 to 30 yuan. The percentage for 31 to 40 yuan is even lower, while 41 to 50 yuan surprisingly accounts for 25.01%. This unique situation is due to several inland transportation companies needing a large number of drivers, but there are too few job seekers with this ability, so less than 2% are successfully hired (see Tables 7 and 10). 51 to 60 yuan accounts for 1.22%, 61 to 70 yuan accounts for 3.6%, and opportunities above 71 yuan are extremely rare, totaling only 0.6%. Opportunities for commission-based compensation account for 22.44% of total compensation. This type of compensation depends entirely on sales ability, which benefits the employing organization the more people there are, but very few job seekers believe they have sales ability (see Table 3). This type of compensation is practically worse than a salary of less than 10 yuan for them. In general, the compensation offered by employers is still lower than the compensation sought by job seekers, which on the one hand shows the decline of the isolated island economy, and on the other hand can help prove why some opportunities are not taken. The most opportunities for talent recruitment are still commercial in nature, with the most common position being salesperson, but most of these positions are calculated on a commission basis, except for a few who are paid a salary. There are very few people willing to take the job and have sales ability, so most of these opportunities are missed. The next most common position is trainee, with extremely low pay, usually only providing room and board and a small allowance for shoes and socks. The next most common opportunities are for salespersons, managers, clerks, bookkeepers, accountants, etc., but there are not many of these opportunities. Compared with the previous year, the percentage has decreased significantly. This year it accounts for less than 39% of the total opportunities (the previous year accounted for 59.6%). The next most numerous opportunities for talent recruitment are in transportation, accounting for 29.55%, a newly emerging opportunity this year. Detailed breakdowns include drivers, telegraphers, and combined telegraph report operators, with better pay and most service organizations located inland. There are also considerable opportunities for skilled workers, such as auto repair, sand casting, planer, lathe, and weaving. Educational and literary talents tend to be teachers in primary and secondary schools, tutors, and clerks. Opportunities for industrial and engineering talents are even rarer than in the previous year. Large-scale industries have moved inland, so opportunities have naturally decreased.</p>
<p>Talent Recruitment Compensation Classification (Table 8)</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Comparison</p>
<p>The above discussion can give a general picture of the overall situation of talent supply and demand. The number of job seekers and job opportunities are not very different and seem to be able to adapt to each other. However, in reality, what are the achievements? According to the statistics in Tables 7 and 8, there are 2,027 job opportunities, and only 637 people were successfully placed, less than one-third of the job opportunities, and even lower compared to the total number of job seekers, only slightly more than one-fourth. The number is extremely small. The main reasons for the analysis are: Firstly, few job seekers have specialized skills, and they cannot adapt to the arrival of opportunities. Secondly, the duties required for the job do not meet the needs of job seekers, such as salespersons and drivers. Thirdly, the compensation given by employers is excessively low, far less than the general level before the war, and the required education level and experience are excessively high. It is no wonder that the situation of mismatch between supply and demand has increased.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education has attached great importance to drama education in recent years, such as selecting and compiling drama selections, reviewing and approving banned Peking opera repertoires, designating the National Drama School to study our country's inherent drama, and the Shandong Provincial Drama Theater to focus on studying opera. These have all been actively promoted. The first, second, and third traveling drama education troupes, which directly implement education, have traveled through Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces to promote the War of Resistance and national construction, and to cooperate with local administrative organs to run training courses and cultivate drama talents. The achievements are remarkable and praised everywhere. Now, the Ministry believes that it is necessary to carry out traveling education in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and other provinces, and has specially established the Fourth Traveling Drama Troupe, and appointed Li Pu as the head of the troupe, and started preparations to go to the northwest provinces to work in a short period of time.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Finance: Rumors Spread, Gold Prices Rise Alarmingly Again, Exchange Rate Unexpectedly Weak, Rise Feels More Powerful, Closing at a High of 3,800 Yuan <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash scalping dark market saw prices soar following the sharp contraction of the exchange rate, breaking through the 3,800 yuan mark. The recent vigorous gold market was even more prosperous. Operators were both happy and worried, as the rise came unexpectedly quickly. The market opened steadily in the morning, slightly lower by three yuan, at 3,730 yuan. Shortly after, the exchange rate was reported to be slightly weak. A certain money exchange business took the lead in buying, and the price reached 3,750 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate turned soft, pawnshops rushed to sell, and securities firms also sold, a certain gold firm also sold off, and although a certain money exchange business still had demand, it felt insufficient, and the market fell to a low of 3,710 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange rate stopped falling and gradually stabilized. Hong Kong gangs suddenly became active, and the noon closing was pulled up by more than ten yuan, closing at 3,728 yuan. The afternoon started flat, but the underlying trend was firm. As late as 2:30 pm, rumors spread, and the exchange rate contracted. A certain bank searched and bought aggressively, gold firms continued to absorb, securities firms also switched from selling to buying, and Hong Kong gangs were even more active. Although cash firms, pawnshops, and retail investors who made profits took the opportunity to supply, the supply was less than the demand, and the price soared to 3,380 yuan. In an instant, because sellers were hard to find, the price jumped another 40 yuan, closing at a high of 3,820 yuan. Trading was very active, with as many as three to four thousand taels. The initial price of gold ornaments in pawnshops was set, and then raised by five yuan. Customs gold prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Scalping Soars by 87 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the early hours of the morning, each tael (ten liang), the initial situation was still flat. The cash firm first sold 20 taels to the money exchange business for 3,730 yuan, which was three yuan lower than the previous day. Shortly after, the rise suddenly started, and it was heard that the exchange rate was tight, and people were encouraged. A certain gold firm and money exchange business scrambled to buy, and at that time a certain firm in the securities business also had a slight appetite, so the market soared by 20 yuan. The securities firm sold 10 taels to the gold firm for 3,750 yuan. Later, the selling intention of pawnshops turned strong, and the exchange rate had turned soft, and a certain securities firm came to sell, and the market could not support it, and immediately fell by 10 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money exchange business for 3,740 yuan. At that time, although a certain money exchange business's appetite turned stronger, a certain gold firm suddenly stopped buying aggressively, and soon fell another 30 yuan. The money exchange business bought 10 taels from the gold firm for 3,710 yuan. After that, the exchange rate turned flat, and the Hong Kong gang came to activity, and the selling wind gradually dissipated, and the market gradually returned to flat, pulling up 24 yuan. The gold firm bought 50 taels from the money exchange business for 3,734 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm sold on behalf of customers, and then fell slightly to 3,725 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange business and a certain bank bought each other, and then rose by 8 yuan. The money exchange business bought 10 taels from the securities firm for 3,733 yuan. By the time of closing, a certain securities firm continued to sell, and immediately fell by 6 yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the gold firm for 3,727 yuan. Then the securities firm sold another 10 taels to a certain bank for 3,728 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened flat, first the pawnshops bought 10 taels from the gold firm for 3,730 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher. Later, a certain pawnshop and money exchange business competed to buy, and immediately raised it by 15 yuan. The money exchange business bought 30 taels from the securities firm for 3,745 yuan. At that time, the securities firm continued to sell more than 100 taels, and once slightly returned. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the pawnshops for 3,735 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange rate was reported to be weak, it caused a buying wind. A certain gold firm and a certain bank each absorbed dozens of taels, and then rose by 7 yuan to 3,742 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business slightly returned, once slightly 4 yuan, for 3,738 yuan. After that, there were sudden rumors in the market, and the foreign exchange rate was tightened. The atmosphere of speculation was pervasive, and the general sellers were as drunk as they were. A certain bank, money exchange business and securities firms etc. mutually released orders to buy, although pawnshops and cash firms and retail investors who made profits sold out, they still could not suppress the fierce momentum. In an instant, it had soared to 3,780 yuan. The buying wind was even stronger after entering, but the sellers were gradually lacking, so the rising trend was even sharper. In an instant, it rushed out of the 3,800 yuan mark. A certain gold firm in the securities business bought a total of 40 taels from the pawnshops and securities firms for 3,820 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to rise by 87 yuan. It was heard that after the closing, it once fell back to 3,805 yuan due to retail investors selling out. Later, it was finally pulled back up to 3,820 yuan due to buyers coming again. The whole day was up and down 110 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's brand gold was 10 yuan higher according to scalping. The received amount decreased by more than 20 yuan. The current bidding gold is 560 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Hang at 5 Yuan Higher in the Evening</p>
<p>At the beginning of the sale of gold jewelry in pawnshops, Datong Bank still suspended at 380 yuan per tael. By 4:05 pm, it hung at 5 yuan higher. As a result, Datong Bank changed to suspend at 385 yuan. The new bank was the same as the above price. The receiving was 15 yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Sudden Change in the Foreign Exchange Market: Qiao Zhifu Makes Massive Purchases Eight Times a Day; British Gold Nears the Five Pence Mark <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing price. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was stable in the morning session. Unexpectedly, rumors spread in the afternoon that Japan was implementing new economic aggression policies and that a certain Chinese official was changing their position. This led to massive buying of foreign exchange by Japanese firms. The Jewish trader Qiao Zhifu also heard the news and covered his short positions (said to be worth £400,000). As a result, the closing price (tight at five pence 0.0625) exceeded expectations compared to yesterday's soft close. The opening was uneventful with little activity. Later, some Chinese merchants continued to buy, but this was offset by exporters supplying funds, resulting in a slight tightening. British gold was at five pence 0.03125 and the US dollar at eight yuan 4.0625. However, some profits were quickly taken, stabilizing the situation. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric suddenly supplied funds, and Chinese merchants also switched from buying to selling. Although some tried to buy again at cheaper prices, the market remained loose. British gold was at five pence 0.25, and the US dollar also reached eight yuan and a half. By noon, selling had disappeared, and buyers vanished as well, resulting in a stagnant market. There were no changes until the closing, remaining the same as the morning opening. The afternoon opening was initially unchanged. However, after 2:30 PM, the market suddenly became turbulent. Japanese firms started buying heavily, and Qiao Zhifu covered his short positions in large amounts. Foreign firms also increased their settlements. Although foreign banks like McAlister supplied funds, the supply could not meet the demand, and the market tightened sharply to five pence 0.0625 and eight yuan 1.875 at closing. This was one point five six two five tighter and twenty-five softer than the previous day. The futures market remained the same as the spot market.</p>
<p>The Morning Market Was Particularly Calm</p>
<p>The morning started calmly, with London exchange rates flat. Silver prices in New York and foreign exchange rates for the US dollar were closed for Thanksgiving. London gold remained stable. Exchange rates between British and US dollars, British and French francs, and British and Shanghai dollars were all flat. Central bank listing prices for various currencies remained unchanged. Banks opened the spot market with a selling price of five pence 0.21875 for British gold and eight yuan 4.375 for the US dollar, with no change from the previous close. Although exporters sold slightly after the opening, Chinese merchants and beneficial parties bought, causing a temporary imbalance in supply and demand. The market showed a slight softening. Beneficial parties bought spot British gold from exporters and foreign banks at five pence 0.2875 and 0.203125. Later, Chinese merchants bought spot US dollars from a major bank at eight yuan 4.0625. The HSBC listing price was not strong, and there was no change in the silver balance tax. Afterwards, beneficial parties started to sell, and Hong Kong Electric suddenly supplied funds, causing Chinese merchants to sell as well. The market shifted from tight to loose. Beneficial parties sold spot US dollars to currency exchange businesses at eight yuan 4.375. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric, Chinese merchants, and certain banks sold spot British gold to Huabi and beneficial parties at five pence 0.21875 and 0.25, and spot US dollars at eight yuan 4.375 and half a yuan. Near noon, selling subsided, and buyers disappeared, resulting in a flat market. At the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were five pence 0.21875 for British gold and eight yuan 4.375 for the US dollar, unchanged from the morning opening.</p>
<p>Rumors Trigger Buying Frenzy</p>
<p>The afternoon market was initially flat. However, after 2:30 PM, the market suddenly became turbulent. Japanese firms started buying heavily, and it was rumored that the Jewish trader Qiao Zhifu had large short positions and was urgently covering them. This spurred speculation and buying among foreign firms. Although foreign banks like McAlister were willing to supply funds, the demand still far exceeded the supply, causing the market to tighten sharply. Japanese firms, foreign firms, and speculators bought spot British gold from McAlister and certain foreign banks at five pence 0.1875 to 0.09375, and spot US dollars from eight yuan 3.75 to 2.25. The willingness of foreign banks to supply funds diminished further. At the late closing, the bank's spot selling prices were five pence 0.0625 for British gold and only eight yuan 1.875 for the US dollar. December British gold was at five pence and the US dollar at eight yuan 0.625. As a result, spot and futures British gold were one point five six two five tighter and the US dollar was twenty-five softer than the previous day.</p>

<p>The Tianjin Exchange Market Was Extremely Stagnant</p>

<h3 id="e65">Foreign Currencies Surge <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were very stable in the morning, with most remaining unchanged. After 3:00 PM in the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that a certain important person had resigned, causing drastic changes in the market. There was strong buying of British and US gold pounds, and the market price rose sharply. Customers were eagerly buying British and US gold notes, and the market price rose sharply. US gold notes were only eleven yuan and nine jiao in the morning, but the surge was severe in the afternoon, reaching twelve yuan and three jiao and three fen in the evening market. There was strong demand for Hong Kong notes and French franc notes, and the market was firm. Singapore, Dutch, Annam, and Robbie notes were frequently requested by customers, and the supply from currency exchange businesses was insufficient, causing prices to rise. Canadian and Philippine notes followed the US gold notes and rose sharply. There was little supply or demand for Australian gold notes for a long time. Today, the difference between the Australian gold notes and British gold notes was too large, and there was some demand, causing prices to rise sharply. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes were balanced, and the market was stable, remaining at one yuan two jiao five fen five li in the evening market. The demand for Korean notes increased, and the evening market price was one yuan one jiao four fen two li. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds rise by two yuan and three jiao, British gold notes rise by one yuan and one jiao, US gold pounds rise by three yuan, US gold notes rise by four jiao and one fen, Hong Kong notes rise by three fen, French franc notes rise by one fen, Singapore and Dutch notes both rise by two jiao, Robbie notes rise by one jiao, Canadian notes rise by three jiao, and Annam and Philippine notes both rise by five fen.

<p>The unofficial securities market was stagnant and fluctuating yesterday. After various parties pushed up the market prices, different groups felt hesitant and uncertain. The current situation is brewing and becoming more complex, with the black and white yet to be distinguished. Speculation is dangerous at this time. At this critical moment, the speech will occur in the autumn. Yesterday passed peacefully in the morning, but weakly in the afternoon. The stomach for large volumes was better, and the bulls added to their positions. Some say that someone will become a minister again, but it is doubtful whether support will be held. The market price of Ding-type stocks was slightly lower by five fen, while the rest continued to improve by about one jiao. The total turnover was about four to five hundred thousand yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transaction: 15 shares of Guanshengyuan stock were traded at a price of thirty-two yuan and five jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public stock market continued to surge, ignoring a large amount of profit-taking. Several stocks set new high price records. The closing trend was exceptionally strong. The trading volume was extremely high, setting a new record for daily trading. Previously, the highest trading volume was 510,000 shares on March 18, 1937, but yesterday it reached an unprecedented number of 560,107 shares. The closing prices of heavily traded stocks are listed below.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading was dominated by Paddington, Rubber, Trust, Tai Nama La, and Langezhi stocks.</p>

<p>Since the British Ruiyong Shipyard Co., Ltd. merged with Yesong Dockyard to establish the British Union Shipyard Co., Ltd., its business has gradually improved in recent years. All the company's assets are represented by the shares of the British Union Shipyard. Rather than maintaining the status quo, it is better to liquidate the company as soon as possible and distribute the shares of the British Union Shipyard directly to the shareholders, which can slightly reduce various administrative expenses. When British Union Shipyard paid an interim dividend of 5% this spring, this plan was already being considered. According to the then projections, if the British Union Shipyard's final dividend was also 5%, then after Ruiyong's liquidation, in addition to recovering the preferred shares and clearing various debts, ten Ruiyong ordinary shares could be distributed with nine British Union shares. However, since the Year of the Ox, the business of British Union Shipyard has been exceptionally good, and it is estimated that the final dividend can be slightly better than previously estimated. Therefore, the liquidation result of Ruiyong can be even more satisfactory. At the extraordinary general meeting held at the beginning of this month, the board of directors submitted the proposed liquidation plan for discussion. The contents are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All debts will be paid in full at face value (including the general manager's compensation of 75,000 yuan in cash and 5,000 shares of British Union).</p>
<p>(2) All preferred shares will be redeemed, and dividends will cease from the date of liquidation.</p>
<p>(3) One share of British Union stock will be paid for each ordinary share.</p>
<p>(4) If there is any surplus, additional cash will be paid.</p>
<p>The British Maotai Trading Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend for 1939 on December 8, at a rate of three yuan per share in national currency.</p>
<p>The British Shanghai Tugboat Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay dividends in December. The preferred shares will pay an interim dividend of 3.5%, equivalent to one tael and seven qian and five fen of silver. The ordinary shares will pay a dividend of eight yuan in national currency per share.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Yarn and Cotton: Same Traders Importing Cotton Becomes Increasingly Heated; Coarse Cotton Becomes More Popular; Ignition Flower Cotton Continues to Rise <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The transaction of local cotton is extremely frequent. Same traders buy and sell with each other frequently. Same traders purchased 500 bales of American cotton and settled at the block corner price. Most have the same goal and are optimistic. The reason is that the production this year is not abundant, and the sources from all sides are limited. Secondly, the prices of American and Indian cotton markets are hopeless in this war era. Therefore, although factory consumption is not prosperous, traders' intention to import is more enthusiastic. Today's Bombay telegram predicted that Indian cotton would fall by 10 Robbie, but people's minds were not affected in the slightest. The situation of fine cotton is still moderate because American cotton can still be purchased, but coarse cotton has Yuyao cotton, which is now under the strict control of the national government to protect resources, and the import to Shanghai is blocked. The corner block price of Indian cotton has risen sharply, and the calculation is not good. Therefore, the two items of ignition machine and Tongzhou coarse cotton have become popular, and the selling price has advanced steadily, rising by two or three yuan from the previous day. The source from northern Jiangsu has arrived: 350 bales of Tonghua cotton, 697 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 484 bales of Beisha cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving, but according to a telegram from a certain bank, it is predicted that the market price will rise slightly by 3 or 4 pounds. The Indian cotton market continues to rise sharply. The highest price of white block in April and May reached 260 Robbie. Subsequently, due to most bulls taking profits, the market situation turned weary. As a result, the closing price, including the forecast, fell by 14 Robbie. Egypt then rose by another 40 to 50 pounds. Liverpool spot rose by more than 10 pence, and forward fell by more than 10 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transaction: Yesterday, Shenxin Factory slightly increased its appetite again, and its raw materials were still mainly for spinning 20 counts. Traders also slightly purchased, but they were all long-fiber. Japanese manufacturers imported American cotton more strongly than Chinese factories. There were transactions of several thousand bales a day. The cotton market yesterday, converted at an American exchange rate of 8 yuan and 4.375, is listed below as the price including tax delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Indian Cotton Shows Signs of Retreat; Cotton Yarn Buyers Lack Strength <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which rose sharply the previous day, entered a rotating path yesterday. In fact, the US cotton market was closed, and the Bombay cotton market had been soaring for days, showing signs of retreat. The telegram predicted that today's prices for both coarse and fine cotton would fall by 10 Robbie. Thus, people's minds became relaxed again, and the buying momentum was not as strong as it used to be. At the same time, although the demand from Hong Kong merchants did not stop, the purchases were all retail transactions, and there was no news of wholesale development. Therefore, the rising momentum failed to maintain progress. Only because the cotton market could not be hoped to be loose, the foundation of the yarn market could always be consolidated.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the yarn market was moderate. Because foreign cotton was feared to have a retreat, the buying mood was not strong. The opening price did not move. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 652 yuan, which was no different from the previous day. It was heard that the foreign exchange had changed very little, and the Guangbang lacked transactions for 20-count yarn, but the appetite for 10-count coarse yarn was always trying. Therefore, 20-count Double Horse was slightly weak, falling by 3 yuan and breaking the 50 yuan mark. By the time of closing, it slightly improved. It was found that the various gangs had bought 1,685 bales in half a day, and the market was uneven compared with the previous day. Tongyi Factory opened 200 bales of 23-count Dafa at a price of 635 yuan, and Defeng Factory opened 100 bales of 17-count Gold Double Lion at a price of 595 yuan, all cash prices. The amount of each gang's mouth purchase is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e70">Food: Rice Prices Are Difficult to Loosen; Tightening Again After Loosening; Foreign Rice Has Arrived and is Available <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The rice market was weak yesterday morning. The sources continued to arrive from various directions, including 34 to 5 cars of goods from Sujia Kuntong, and more than 2,000 bags of goods transported from Huxipu to Changbang. This caused people's minds to be weak. In addition, the foreign rice that was ordered had been transported from Hong Kong to 10,000 bags and was thrown on the market, and the impact was most restricted by the customer point. The hoarders searched and handled, considering that the customer point price was the cheapest at that time, and the market goods were lightly allowed, and they considered it to be more stable than other goods, and they were quite optimistic. Therefore, the stockpiled customer point was the most, and now the market has depreciated for days. The hope has been broken, and it has been hit by foreign rice. They all endured the pain and continued to compete to get rid of it. Therefore, the customer point price in the early market fell by nearly yuan. However, because the retail sales market was still not smooth, it continued to depreciate. Until the middle market, it reached about one and a half yuan, and the Jingwu point was weaker than the Jiangbei point. The special goods were priced at about 30 yuan, and the market goods were at 29 and a half yuan. As for thick and thin rice and Luyang point, the situation was also poor at this time, and the transaction was clear, following the footsteps of the customer point. The market was reduced by 70 to 80 cents. Although the arrival of Bianyin Yuan was not prosperous, the wineries and snack shops, rice carriers, etc. saw that the rice price was going downstream, and they all looked forward and dared not enter much. The way out was the most astringent, and the price fell sharply by about 2 yuan. At that time, the overall market was extremely tired, but the market changes were the most unpredictable. In a moment, the general customers considered that the glutinous price seemed to have fallen through, and they suddenly started again and took advantage of the cheap price to handle it. For a time, they asked each other, and the situation turned from tired to tight. Whether it was the local town or the stomach, they were all active. Under the shouting of the sellers, the market for thick glutinous rice and Luyang point immediately rebounded. Therefore, the result was first tired and then tight, which can be called a standard. The closing market was often true special glutinous rice 36 yuan, special glutinous rice 35 yuan, Sukun white glutinous rice 33 and a half yuan, 323 yuan, 289 yuan for those with water stains, Luyang point 312 yuan, the market for the rest, such as thin rice and customer point Bianyin Yuan, etc., also seemed tight, but the market was still half a yuan to one yuan cheaper than the previous market. As for foreign rice, because it was fresh when it first arrived, the sales market was quite prosperous, and 800 bags of long grains were opened, and 2,000 bags of round grains came. The round grain Annam glutinous rice was 31 and a half yuan, 31 yuan, and the long grain Saigon was 30 yuan, 5 jiao, 30 yuan. The total transaction in the city was more than 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice refuses to loosen, and new transactions are difficult to approach. However, the price of glutinous rice has been downstream for days, and it is difficult for the foreign rice spot market to stand firm. Yesterday, 2,693 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, which were transported from Hong Kong by Taikoo Company's Hunan ship. It is heard that the foreign rice was purchased by the Beiyang gang, and 2,440 bags were transported to Yantai, and 250 bags were transported to Weihaiwei, and will be transferred to the ship next Monday.</p>

<p>Recently, soybean oil and peanut oil have created an unprecedentedly high market price. Although there is also an impact of poor sources, the manipulated components are more. The actual sales in the market do not seem to be so eager to collect. Most of the huge daily transaction volume is the same industry buying and selling each other, raising the market price, taking risks, and ignoring the pain of the public to raise to a level of one yuan in national currency for one catty of oil. How crazy and harmful is this? Yesterday, a new high point was built up again. 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were opened, and the price was raised from 85 yuan to 86 yuan and 5 jiao. 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 83 yuan and 5 jiao to 84 yuan. 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were priced at 63 yuan and 5 jiao. 700 cans of Yantai canned peanut oil were priced at 81 yuan to 81 yuan and 5 jiao. 500 cans of Jiangbei canned raw oil were priced at 81 yuan and 5 jiao to 80 yuan. In addition, 20 barrels of canned raw oil were priced at 81 yuan. Except for the canned oil, which was handled by this street, the rest were purchased by the Hong Kong gangs. It is estimated that 2,085 cans and 150 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>

<p>After Li Jiannan, the false "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," attempted to prevent the transport of Chinese legal tender to Shanghai, the foreign banks firmly opposed it and ignored it. Therefore, Chinese legal tender can be transported to Shanghai as usual to replenish the supply. The amount of legal tender stored in Shanghai is abundant, sufficient for market circulation. It is also heard that a total of 10 million yuan in legal tender was recently transported to Shanghai, belonging to British HSBC and other banks. All were safely unloaded after import and did not encounter any obstruction from any party. Therefore, there is no concern about the lack of circulation of legal tender in the Shanghai concession area. Since the obstruction of the transport of legal tender to Shanghai has not materialized, it has little to do with the prosperity and decline of Shanghai's foreign exchange market and there is no reason to weaken the exchange market.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Regulation of Jiao Tickets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, according to the Suzhou Satin Group of the Silk and Satin Industry Association, stated that there is a shortage of jiao tickets recently, making it inconvenient to purchase daily necessities and affecting social livelihoods. It is proposed to request the Central Bank to issue a sufficient amount of jiao tickets from the treasury and increase printing to facilitate the market. This has been forwarded to the Central Bank for consideration. A reporter from the New Sound Agency learned from the bank yesterday that the subsidiary coins and notes issued by the Central, China, Communications, Agricultural, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Agricultural Banks in Shanghai, divided into five jiao, two jiao five fen, two jiao, one jiao, and four types, are quite large in number and sufficient for market circulation. It is said that the two jiao and one jiao issued by the Central Bank and published by the Zhonghua Book Company are the most numerous.</p>
<p>Shortage Panic Can Be Relieved</p>
<p>Recently, due to the completion of the issuance of the stored inventory, it was necessary to temporarily suspend the issuance, resulting in a sudden shortage in the market. It is heard that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has requested the head office to transport the printed subsidiary coins and notes to Shanghai for regulation. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they will be issued by the branch. Therefore, the panic of the shortage of subsidiary coins and notes will be relieved soon. The one fen and five fen coins and notes have been contracted to be printed by the American Yongning Company. After the printing is completed and delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, an official announcement will be issued.</p>

<p>According to news from the shipping industry, among the overseas Chinese serving on foreign merchant ships, the Chinese employees on foreign ships traveling on the Pacific route are the most numerous. Since the outbreak of the European War, the relevant shipping companies have tightened their expenses, resulting in a large reduction in wages. In the past, the average monthly salary of Chinese employees on British and French postal ships was 30 to 50 Hong Kong dollars, and they could also engage in other side businesses, such as small businesses. However, after the war, due to the tightening of expenses, the salaries of the employees have been reduced by one-third. In addition, there is no security guarantee for navigation, and there is no way to manage side businesses. Therefore, most employees are forced to resign voluntarily. Recently, when the French postal ship Adete Dingpeng sailed from France to Shanghai, more than 30 Chinese employees resigned to the shipping company in Hong Kong. They were all from Guangdong and had served as tea servants on the ship for many years. They have landed in Hong Kong and returned to their hometowns.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 37th day anniversary of the death of the centenarian Ma Xiangbo. Ma's relatives, friends, and Catholic believers held a 37th day memorial mass at St. Joseph's Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession at 7:30 AM yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The 57th Day Memorial is Being Planned</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM, Ma's nephews Zhu Zhiyao and Zhu Jilin, great-grandchildren Zhang Chongren and his wife, and Catholic believers He Lizhong, Liu Changyin, Wang Baolun, Zhu Luyi, and other guests, including Pu Qiting, and other 500 people had gathered in Joseph's Church in the Catholic Church. Most of the students of Louis School, organized by the Catholic Church, also participated. When entering the church, a portrait of Ma with a black border and white background was distributed to the participants, inscribed with "The Holy Lord Grants Him Eternal Peace and Illuminates Him with Eternal Light," and "Holy Name Joseph," and adding the explanation: "Centenarian Ma Gong Xiangbo returned to the Lord on November 4th of the 28th year of the Republic of China. November 24, 1939, 7:30 AM, Yangjingbang Joseph's Church 37th Day Memorial Mass Ceremony Commemoration."</p>
<p>The Memorial Mass Was Solemn and Grand</p>
<p>The Joseph's Church was solemnly and solemnly arranged, with a memorial platform placed in the center, surrounded by dozens of white torches. All the ceremonies were similar to those held at St. Peter's Church on Luban Road. The main celebrant was Father Zhang Duanliu, the principal of Xuhui Middle School, and the co-celebrants were Father Song Joseph and Father Wang Fang of the Catholic Church. The participants were students of Louis School. The music was led and played by Zhu Xisheng, a famous Catholic musician, and the choir was also composed of Louis students. This memorial mass was a five-six grand ceremony, so it was quite grand. In addition to chanting scriptures and praying, the Holy Communion ceremony was held. The ceremony ended at 8:20 AM.</p>
<p>The 57th Day Memorial is Being Planned</p>
<p>According to Father Zhang, the principal of Xuhui Middle School, after the death of Ma Gong Xiangbo, people from all walks of life in Shanghai and Catholic believers have launched a series of memorial activities. The Shanghai Catholic Action Association, in accordance with Catholic etiquette, has held mass ceremonies on the "Third Day," "First Seven," and "Thirty-Seventh Days" calculated from the date of death for the sake of transcending. Our school, in addition to holding a memorial on the Third Day, also held a ceremony by the school board on the 27th Day. According to Catholic etiquette, the thirtieth day after death is also an important memorial period. The Catholic Action Association may hold a memorial ceremony again on the 57th Day, but because the churches in Shanghai have held them one after another, the location is yet to be determined. Our school is the first school that Xiang Lao entered in his childhood. Recently, dozens of years ago, we found the student award records. During the Qing Xianfeng 7th year, Xiang Lao won the first place in the Western Language Award and continued for three years. This shows that Xiang Lao was diligent and studious in his childhood. Now our school has properly preserved the records for permanent commemoration.</p>

<p>The recent surge in rice prices has significantly impacted the livelihoods of citizens. Due to the increasing supply of national rice, market conditions continue to weaken. Tribute rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, and public sentiment is bearish. The Rice Merchants Association Tea Party and Market Management Committee are not only trying to lower rice prices but also thoroughly investigating speculators. The Brokers Association has issued a notice to comply with regulations and refrain from privately raising prices. Yesterday, the rice market remained weak, unable to recover, and prices fell by about one yuan. Detailed information follows:</p>
<p>Arrival of Tribute Rice</p>
<p>The Saigon authorities had previously banned rice exports, leading to the cessation of joint purchases of foreign rice by various groups and organizations in the city. The Saigon authorities have now lifted the ban, allowing rice exports. Shanghai rice merchants have jointly purchased tribute rice, and deals continue to be made. It is reported that 1,500 tons, equivalent to 15,000 bags, were agreed upon via telegraph yesterday. Rice industry sources revealed that the previously agreed upon 2,400 tons have already been loaded onto ships and set sail. 10,000 bags arrived yesterday and have already been unloaded and entered the warehouse for trading.</p>
<p>Committee Investigation</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association Tea Party and Market Management Committee is responsible for assessing market prices and maintaining order. All merchant representatives entering and exiting the market each day must present an entry permit issued by the committee. Market trading rules have been established, and committee members are assigned daily to observe market order. Due to the resurgence of speculative practices, which artificially raise market prices, market order has been disrupted, and prices have soared, causing public unease. The committee, in fulfilling its duties, is conducting a thorough investigation of speculators and issuing earnest warnings.</p>

<p>Mr. Santos, a British employee of the Da Mei Printing Factory, residing at 24, Lane 506, North Szechuan Road, was awakened at 3:00 AM by six Japanese Marine patrolmen who broke down his door with their rifle butts to search the premises. Mr. Santos, his wife, and his children were all startled from their sleep and arose to investigate. They saw six Japanese Marines, each holding a rifle with a bayonet fixed, standing at the door. Two of them entered the house and asked Mr. Santos who he was. Mr. Santos immediately presented his British passport to one of the soldiers and stated that he and his family were British citizens. However, the Marines did not examine the passport and threw it back at him. They then conducted a thorough search of the house, turning over clothes and bedding. Mr. Santos protested, but to no avail. Afterward, Mr. Santos reported the incident to the British Consulate General. The British Consulate is expected to lodge a protest with the Japanese Consulate.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Detailed Record of International Airmail Rates and Delivery Costs <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, in response to the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and to compensate for losses in international postage, increased all rates, including regular mail, registered mail, and airmail, by 100% starting September 1st. The rate for regular mail, originally 25 cents for every 20 grams, was increased to 50 cents. For every 20 grams exceeding that weight, an additional 30 cents was added. The registration fee was also increased from 25 cents to 50 cents. Airmail rates were also doubled across the board. After this had been in effect for a short time, the Shanghai Postal Administration received a notice from the Hong Kong Post Office that airmail rates to various parts of Southeast Asia would need to be increased again. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, international airmail rates were re-priced, leading to considerable confusion among the public. In addition, the airmail rates quoted by different postal clerks varied, leading to complaints to the post office. An investigation has been conducted, and the airmail rates for Royal, Franco-Chinese, and Sino-American airlines are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Royal Airmail Rates</p>
<p>Royal Airlines, departing from Hong Kong, English name Imperial Airline, abbreviated as I. A. L. The rates to various overseas Southeast Asian destinations are calculated in units of 5 grams each. For example, to send mail to Hanoi, the airmail fee is $1.30 per 5 grams, plus the regular mail fee of 50 cents, totaling $1.80. Registration requires an additional registration fee of 50 cents. If the weight exceeds 25 grams, the airmail fee is multiplied by five ($6.50), plus the regular mail fee of 80 cents, because regular mail is 50 cents for every 20 grams, and for every 20 grams exceeding that, the regular mail fee is doubled and an additional 30 cents is added. Airmail rates to various parts of Southeast Asia via Royal Airlines are more expensive than Franco-Chinese Airlines, but the speed is similar. Rates to other regions vary. To Hanoi, Indochina, Saigon, Indochina, the Philippines, Siam, Burma (Rangoon, etc.), Malaya (Singapore, etc.), British India, India (Bombay, Calcutta), Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Cairo, and Egypt, the rate is $1.30 per 5 grams. To European countries, it is $1.75 per 5 grams. To the Gold Coast, Portuguese East Africa, Nigeria, Nyasaland, the Union of South Africa, and Southwest Africa, it is $3.40 per 5 grams. To Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the islands of the Western Pacific, it is also $1.30 per 5 grams.</p>
<p>Franco-Chinese Airmail Rates</p>
<p>Franco-Chinese Airlines, English name Air France, abbreviated as A. F. There are two departure points, Hong Kong and Hanoi. The rate from Hong Kong is 25 cents more expensive per 5 grams than from Hanoi. The following rates are calculated from Hong Kong departures. To calculate the rate from Hanoi, simply subtract 25 cents per 5 grams. From Hong Kong to Hanoi, Indochina, it is 25 cents per 5 grams; to Saigon, Indochina, 60 cents; to Siam, Burma (Rangoon, etc.), Malaya, Singapore, 70 cents; to British India, India (Bombay, Calcutta), 90 cents; to Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Cairo, and Egypt, $1.55; to European countries, $1.00; to Algeria and French Algeria, $2.15; to Nigeria, the Gold Coast, Portuguese East Africa, Nyasaland, the Union of South Africa, and Southwest Africa, all African regions, $3.65; to Australia, $1.55.</p>
<p>Sino-American Airmail Rates</p>
<p>Sino-American Airlines, the Pacific route of American Airlines, P. A. A., also departs from Hong Kong. From Hong Kong to the Philippines, it is 35 cents; to Guam, $1.05; to Hawaii (Honolulu), $2.40; to the United States (U.S.A.), $3.75; to Canada, Mexico, Newfoundland, $4.45; to Saint Martin, Saba, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, the Windward Islands, etc., $4.80; to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, etc., $6.50. In addition to departures from Hong Kong, there is also transport by ship to the United States, with departures from San Francisco to destinations within the United States (U. S. Air Service From San Francisco), which is cheaper. From San Francisco to the United States, it is 65 cents per 5 grams; to Canada, Mexico, 70 cents; to Saint Martin, Saba, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, the Windward Islands, etc., $1.05; to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Ecuador, etc., $2.75. Whether Royal, Franco-Chinese, or Sino-American airlines are used, the airmail rate for postcards is the same as for letters, only the regular mail fee is different. Although Franco-Chinese Airlines can reach the interior of the United States, it is far less convenient than Sino-American Airlines, so it is omitted here. The rate for Sino-Japanese airmail is 35 cents for every 20 grams, plus a regular mail fee of 5 cents, totaling 40 cents. For each additional increment in weight, an additional 40 cents is added. Postcards are 18 cents. Printed matter is 75 cents for every 60 grams.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Great Shanghai Evening Post," a Japanese newspaper reports that the Chinese government, in an attempt to disrupt the establishment of a "New Central Regime" and harass the rear of the Japanese army, ordered the 62nd Division, 30th Division, and New Fourth Army to enter Central China in early November. Since November 8th, these units have been in constant combat with Japanese garrisons in Anqing, Wuhu, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other areas. Near Anqing, guerilla artillery units attempted to cut off Yangtze River traffic. East of the Jinpu Railway in eastern Anhui, near Zilaiqiao and Lai'an, the New Fourth Army and Japanese troops have repeatedly clashed, resulting in casualties on both sides.</p>

<p>Over one hundred and fifty unemployed Chinese from Zhejiang Province, repatriated from France and the Netherlands, finding no suitable employment in Shanghai, have decided to return to their native place in groups. The first group of seventy-nine people departed some days ago aboard the Italian company’s “Cang Sai” ship for Zhenhai, then headed to Ningbo to return home. Now, a second group of over thirty people also separately boarded the "Flying Kang" ship of the Lu Ling foreign firm and the "Hana" ship of the Far East company yesterday and today to go to Zhenhai and return home. The remaining personnel are still awaiting ships in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Police jurisdiction over Anhe Temple Road, Columbia Road, and Haig Road in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads area has traditionally been under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which stationed police officers there. Recently, for the past week, the defense of the area has been taken over by a large number of puppet police officers dispatched by the armed police brigade of the puppet Fahua Township, stationed at various checkpoints. More than ten puppet police officers, armed, also guard the corner of Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road and the bus stops of the two roads. The situation is extremely serious. To avoid unnecessary conflict, the British Municipal Council has withdrawn its police officers from the area, awaiting the group of consuls to protest to the puppet municipal government.</p>
<p>Arrested Chinese Police Officers</p>
<p>Some days ago, municipal police officers of the Public Concession were patrolling the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads and were provoked into conflict with "police" of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government." The Western police officers have escaped safely, but two Chinese police officers, along with their weapons, were abducted. There has been no news from outside. It is understood that after the puppet "police" abducted the two Chinese police officers, they handed them over to the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads.</p>
<p>Subjected to Interrogation</p>
<p>Now, the Japanese Military Police have identified the two Chinese police officers as criminal offenders and, on the 23rd of this month, handed them over to the newly established puppet "Local Branch Court" inside Datong University on Zhongshan Road in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads area. After the puppet "prosecutor" held a court hearing, they were all imprisoned separately, and it is not known what "laws" they will be charged with.</p>

<p>The Japanese sentry post at the intersection of Baoshan Road in Zhabei, which originally had two soldiers stationed there, has recently been reduced to one. Pedestrians passing through that place had to be inspected. When the reporter passed through that place at 5:00 PM yesterday, they saw that the Japanese sentry post had been completely removed and pedestrians could pass without being inspected. However, the British army sentry post in the concession remains at the intersection at the end of North Henan Road. Although the Japanese sentry post has been removed, Japanese patrol teams on motorcycles frequently patrol the Baoshan Road and Xinmin Road area. At the Japanese sentry post on North Jiangxi Road, inspections of passing Chinese pedestrians are still very strict. At the breach in Haining Road, in addition to strictly inspecting pedestrians, if they see Chinese people gathered at the corner of Shanghai Telephone Company diagonally opposite their sentry post, they will take a wooden stick and drive them away. Those who are slow to leave will be beaten.</p>

<p>The situation inside the iron fence along North Jiangxi Road has been relatively peaceful recently. However, yesterday afternoon, a large group of Japanese Marine soldiers, carrying weapons, swarmed into the area. First, they searched the East Taihua Lane house by house. The residents of Dong Dexing Lane, Huale Lane, and Fanzhi Lane were also subjected to the same search. The breaches at Haining Road and Wenjianshi Road in the district have also been suddenly closed early since the night before. Residents are also not allowed to move, creating an atmosphere of panic.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Japanese Troops Land in Beihai; Intended to Cut Off the Long-Yong Road <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>By John Ahlers, Translated from the “China Press”</p>
<p>The Domei [Japanese] news service has released the first decisive news that Japanese forces have landed in Dongjing Bay in Guangdong province, saying that the aim of this decisive action is simply to occupy Beihai and seal off the "Free China's" foreign trade from that port. Later, when Japanese forces advanced inland from the Qinzhou area, the Japanese side suggested that they would invade Guangxi from the south, but judging from the sudden deployment of Japanese forces in southwestern Guangdong, the intensity of the Japanese land battles, and the traffic situation, it can be seen that the Japanese forces are pursuing goals with more far-reaching implications than the Japanese side acknowledges. The Japanese forces appear to be aiming to inflict a blow on the Chinese side, the importance of which is comparable to the occupation of Guangzhou and the severing of one of the vital transportation lines connecting "Free China" with the outside world. The true objective of the Japanese forces appears to be to block the Longzhou-to-Yongning highway and, if possible, to occupy that highway.</p>
<p>In the earlier months of this year, Beihai was the most important export port for "Free China." More metals and products were shipped from Beihai to Hong Kong than from any other port along the South China coast, and imports through Beihai were also substantial. However, as the threat from the Japanese forces on Leizhou Island increased, the Chinese authorities shifted most of Beihai trade to other ports, especially Fort Bayard in the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities evacuated part of the residents of Beihai, destroyed some of the facilities and equipment in the port, and most of the roads leading inland. In September, shipping traffic in Beihai was reduced to six ships with a total of 11,249 tons, and Beihai's foreign trade also decreased, with exports valued at 836,530 yuan and imports valued at 67,685 gold units. In September, Beihai accounted for only 10 percent of "Free China's" exports and 1.5 percent of imports. The import of war supplies through Beihai has recently ceased completely.</p>

<p>Zhao Fengying: The girl Zhao Fengying, aged eleven, from Jiangpu County, Jiangsu Province, got lost at approximately 11:30 AM the day before yesterday near Wuchang Road on Broadway. After being discovered by the police, she was transferred by the police station to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section for disposition. According to the child's own account, her biological mother abandoned her, the only child, when she was just three years old, eloping with her lover and disappearing without a trace. There has been no news for many years. Since her mother's departure, the girl has relied solely on her grandmother for survival. Her father, due to poverty, came to Shanghai alone to work in a factory in Pudong. However, in recent years, not only has he not sent any money home, but he has also completely cut off contact, causing the girl and her grandmother deep anxiety. Recently, a fellow villager named Huang Kecheng came to Shanghai, and the girl obtained her grandmother's consent to accompany Huang to Shanghai in an attempt to find her father. However, upon arriving in Shanghai and going to Pudong to search for her father, she found no trace of him. Huang returned to his hometown after finishing his business, entrusting the girl to the care of a friend's family. However, due to the poverty of that family, there was a constant threat of starvation, and the girl was forced to run away on her own, ending up on the streets and begging passersby for a living. The Child Protection Section, considering the girl's pitiful circumstances, has placed her in the Children's Home of the Catholic Orphanage Association. According to reports, the girl still longs to find her father in the orphanage, washing her face with tears every day, hoping that her father will come forward to claim her, so as to fulfill her wish for family reunion.</p>
<p>Zhao Baoshan: The boy Zhao Baoshan, aged nine, from Anhui Province, originally lived with his father on Avenue Bagneux, French Concession. His father, Zhao Yugui, aged forty-five, due to domestic poverty, made a living by selling erotic pictures. Every day at 5:00 PM, Zhao Yugui would instruct his son to go out with him, carrying several bundles of erotic pictures, which his son would hold, while Yugui solicited customers on the street. Recently, while soliciting in the International Settlement, they were discovered by the police, who arrested both father and son and brought them to court for trial. Zhao Yugui was sentenced to imprisonment, and the child Baoshan, being under the age of fourteen, was ordered to be sent to a children's educational institution for foster care. It is now reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section has sent the child to the Children's Home of the Catholic Orphanage Association for education and upbringing. At the same time, according to the investigation by the Protection Section, since the child's father was imprisoned, the child's mother (Zhao, aged thirty-five) has disappeared without a trace. Therefore, the child has now become a miserable orphan with a father but no mother, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Liang Asan, a 50-year-old man from Tongzhou, worked as a gatekeeper for Renji Road Real Estate Company. Last night, while having dinner at home, he drank a large amount of sorghum liquor. At 8:00 PM, he went to the company to relieve the previous shift. Due to the excessive alcohol consumption, Liang became delirious and lost his mind. Upon arriving at the company, he went straight to the iron gate of the elevator on the third floor. Liang automatically opened the iron gate, intending to take the elevator to the fourth floor. However, the company's elevator was stopped on the fifth floor. Liang panicked and lost his footing, falling from the third floor to the bottom level, crushing his skull and dying instantly.</p>
<p>Mao Chenshi, a 20-year-old woman from Ningbo, worked as a maid at No. 40 Model Village, Avenue Foch. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, she was ordered by her employer to go out shopping. While crossing the road, she was suddenly struck by a delivery car from the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, suffering severe abdominal injuries. She was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but her life is in critical condition.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: It is said that the Mao Yuan Yongji Shaoxing Wine Shop claims that on the evening of the 18th of this month, five or six customers, including Wang Amao and Zhang Jiale, came to the shop for a banquet and summoned hostess to serve drinks. Around 11:00 PM, the guests were all tipsy, and for some unknown reason, they started fighting, with bowls and plates flying across the table, scattering shards all over the floor. The staff tried to stop them in vain, and then ordered compensation. However, the customers were aggressive, and the staff had no choice but to call the police officer No. 3048, and the commotion subsided. Because they refused to pay compensation, they asked that the troublemakers be taken to the police station, but the police officer turned a blind eye and left. The incident was reported to the police station and reported in the newspapers the next day. Later, Wang Amao and others realized they were in the wrong and asked someone to mediate, and voluntarily paid compensation. But I read in the Shenbao that Zhang Jiale's correction letter stated that the shop owner had spoken rudely and offended the customers, denied having a hostess serving drinks, and that the shop knew it was in the wrong. This is just an attempt to cover up the truth. In order to uphold the reputation of our shop, we hereby entrust a special letter to make a correction and clarify the truth. Please check and make the correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Shibeng, November 23rd.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I was shocked to read the news in your newspaper on the 20th that Wang Shengquan's daughter was scalded in the lower body and died. I thought to myself that although I have a daughter, she is only a few years old. How could such a young child be married? Moreover, Wu's Wooden Bridge is located in a desolate area with no houses and even fewer residents. I am a tailor with a poor family and no thieves have ever visited my house. Therefore, everything in the report is completely fabricated. I am afraid of causing confusion, so I request a correction. Sincerely, Wang Shengquan, a villager from Qibao Town.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Weather Report <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: Sunny and cold around Shandong, with northwest to north winds.

<p>Lost Official Document Briefcase: The day before yesterday, it was raining heavily. I passed by Wuma Road on business and hired a rickshaw to return to my residence. I found an official document briefcase on the rickshaw. I suppose it was lost due to the hasty action caused by the rain. I immediately reported to the Chinese police near the Zhejiang Grand Theater, who took the official document briefcase and the rickshaw driver to the police station. I am using a corner of this publication to publish a notice of lost property. Please go to the police station to claim it. (Wang Fenggang)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Loss and Gain <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>"To take a loss is to gain, to gain is to take a loss" is truly a wonderful saying, its utility often exceeding "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." In fact, everyone has a desire for gain, but seeking loss and failing to find it is the world's greatest injustice. To truly want gain, with loss as a major premise, is naturally a "good essay." However, gain is also scarce in the world, and you avoid loss as if it were a sworn enemy, fearing you won't be fast enough. If you have the ambition to seek gain but lack the talent to avoid loss, then what you get is mostly unsatisfactory, regardless of whether it is "obvious" or "hidden." Therefore, the philosophy of "unity of loss and gain" was invented, and the above slogan was put forward. And Ah Q is precisely the standard figure of this kind: he gets beaten by others, but says that the other person is his son. At first hearing, it is very laughable, and then it becomes alarming. It turns out that what Ah Q aspires to is also gain, but alas, his strength is not up to the task!</p>
<p>Loss and gain are generally relative. In my contest with the other party, what I get cannot be the same as what the other party gets, unless there is no such thing as competition in the world. However, that world has not yet been produced. Therefore, there is no fear of competition. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, is the best offset. Only the cowardly like Ah Q dare not carry out this "surgery," even though he still claims to be the father.</p>
<p>But taking a step back, the father is not without some demeanor. What is most regrettable is that he becomes someone else's son and still thinks it's glorious. This is truly beyond words.</p>
<p>In this way, the "surgery" is also "talking without getting down to business," and what it relies on is "contagion," which is very easy. For example, if you want to talk about "revolution," you can cite the example of Emperor Qianlong being the young son of Grand Secretary Chen of Hai Ning. Isn't this much more convenient than revolution? Although Emperor Qianlong himself became the son of the "Tartars," the blood cells in the bodies of the later Qing emperors were definitely of the Chen Grand Secretary type. Ugh, "To take a loss is to gain!"</p>
<p>I am very happy with this gain. But throughout history, there have been even greater losses, but naturally even greater gains, which makes me even happier—too happy to be "painful" (!). For example, Miss Wang Zhaojun's marriage to a foreign land. That is truly outrageous! A historical disgrace! Disgrace! But here is where the "essay is." It turns out that if I want to compile a "History of Women's Patriotism," Mulan is listed first, and Miss Wang is second. According to the "chronicle" method, Miss Wang is still the first chapter. And the "Autumn in the Han Palace," which is at the beginning of the Yuan drama selection, thus becomes the best work of national defense (?) literature.</p>
<p>Naturally, some people will be indignant at Emperor Yuan of Han's "giving up his troops and marrying off his daughter" passive method. In the "Plum Blossom Wine" section of "Autumn in the Han Palace," look at his pitiful appearance: "He, he, he (that is, Miss Wang) sadly bids farewell to the Han emperor, I, I, I take hands on the riverbank; his subordinates enter the remote wilderness, my carriage returns to Xianyang... passing the palace wall, circling the corridor; ... near the pepper room, the moon is dim and yellow; ... the night is cool, weeping with cold; the green gauze window, I don't think about it." But his lovelornness is due to Miss Wang's marriage to a foreign land, and the marriage to a foreign land allows the country to "maintain" itself. Ha, "To take a loss is to gain!" We should envy Emperor Yuan of Han for having such a romance and being very patriotic.</p>
<p>But I am also a bit indignant at this "loss." That is naturally Mao Yanshou's unforgivable sin, and Emperor Yuan of Han, in addition to the above-mentioned "gain," does not seem to have asked Miss Wang to take on the job of "female spy," like in the 1940s, when some people sent Miss to put on military uniforms to the distant battlefield to flirt, thus becoming more "active."</p>
<p>However, this was Emperor Yuan of Han's mistake, and it is not mentioned in history, so it is not appropriate to force the people of the Republic of China to bear this indignation, just as it is not necessary to pull Emperor Guangxu to be a Han Chinese.</p>
<p>Here it must be pointed out that it is naturally much more "profitable" for a man to go abroad to recruit a son-in-law than to marry off a daughter, as has always been the case in patriarchal societies. Otherwise, why is Eve one of Adam's ribs? Although it is inevitable to kneel before the "Old Prince" and shout "Dad!" But, think, the world in the future... haha, think, and what else is readily available.</p>
<p>Now is the time to promote "moving history." Of course, it is "not allowed" to turn the emperor into a "president," but if you understand this family secret rich in "××ness" (?), the president may not have the good fortune, but the money for food and clothing will be settled as a result.</p>
<p>So I am going to the beauty salon tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Manifestation of Strength - A Wartime Record - <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>The strategy of "mopping up" the mountain area has undoubtedly completely failed, and Wanxi remains as solid as a rock. So, the most urgent task at hand is not to mobilize troops, replenish military supplies, or strengthen fortifications, but to urgently transport all kinds of things that should be prepared. Machinery, grain, salt, cloth, paper, etc., are all necessities for a long defense. Because Wuhan has been abandoned, these construction materials and economic data may be cut off. Therefore, it is not enough to deal with future difficulties without sufficient storage, which will weaken the strength of the Dabie Mountains. In other words, the fundamental urgent task is economic first, and military affairs are secondary. General Liao Lei said, "Protecting Jianghuai is protecting Longshu; consolidating the Dabie Mountains is also establishing the foundation for future counterattacks." Until the eve of the death of this brave and good general of the Guangxi Army, he was still earnestly instructing his comrades-in-arms with unshakable and firm convictions. This is how important it is to make people realize the importance of the western Anhui base!</p>
<p>In the season when late autumn disappears and early winter arrives, the Dabie Mountains shed their green coat, revealing the majestic posture of copper tendons and iron bones. The common people put down their shovels and plows to participate in the urgent transportation work. The winding mountain paths and the perilous and steep mountain trails all emit the sound of "Hang Yu Hang Yu," which is so pleasant, so neat, and combined with the flowing water of the creek and the flying waterfalls of the cliffs, forming an extraordinary rhythm, you can't help but feel the greatness of human power.</p>
<p>"Aren't you tired, fellow villagers!" Someone asked the light-footed porters with concern.</p>
<p>"Of course not! I..." He pointed to his broad shoulders and replied, "I, on this... Humph, guess, how many pounds can I put on it?" He said, with a proud smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Eighty pounds? Ninety pounds may be able to carry it?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and twenty pounds!" The young porter said in a drawn-out tone, "If you run a short distance, you have to add more weight!" He added two sentences.</p>
<p>The quantity of grain and salt is increasing day by day. The common people know that this is the "source of life." In the weeks of requisitioning and transporting, they created an unprecedented record with their active posture. And they are particularly motivated to rush to transport salt, because they have tasted the pain of the "encirclement and suppression." It is better to let the rice that is about to be harvested fall in the fields. "This is our white rice."</p>
<p>"Strength, how great!" Zhu Foding, with his gray hair, felt satisfied. He is the dean of Guangxi University, but now, he is shouldering a heavier burden than any porter, pushing the potential of the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<h3 id="e101">A Little Story About Language <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This "Language Exhibition" has aroused the attention of many people to language, marking a new boundary in the history of Chinese language. Here I would like to tell a few small stories about language, some with literary interest, some with national sentiment, and only scientific ones are not included. According to Rask, language reflects the cultural activities of various ethnic groups in prehistoric times, such as religion, customs, and institutions; so I hope my "short stories" pay more attention to this.</p>
<p>Adam in Paradise</p>
<p>The "Bible" is the "Book of Books," and my "short stories" should start from here. "In the beginning there was the Word," which is too boring, so put it aside.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 of "Genesis" says that God created the universe in seven days, and then created Adam from dust. The earliest language of mankind is the name of the river (the river is the creator of culture), because the four rivers flowing out of Paradise were the first to be named: the first is called the Pishon River, the second is the Gihon River, the third is the Tigris River, and the fourth is the Euphrates River.</p>
<p>When Adam arrived in Paradise, God taught him the names of all things: "So Adam called each thing, and each thing was named accordingly." This is the beginning of language, which, according to Cambridge University Vice-Chancellor Lightfoot's correct (?) chronology, was around April 25, 4004 BC.</p>
<p>"Adam gave names to all livestock, birds, and beasts; but Adam could not find a companion." God had compassion on him and created Eve. I think why literary works (literature) always talk about love, probably because of this (?).</p>
<p>The Tower of Babel</p>
<p>"Genesis" Chapter 11 begins by saying: "At that time, there was only one language in the world, 'one way of speaking.'" Mankind escaped the flood and came to Shinar, wanting to build a tower whose top would reach Heaven. God saw it and was very angry, saying: "Go and scatter their languages, so that they cannot understand each other."</p>
<p>Because the languages were not the same, the person who wanted bricks could not get bricks, and the person who wanted lime was given a board. The tower could not be built, and from then on mankind lived in various parts of the earth, and the languages were permanently separated.</p>
<p>This Tower of Babel is actually the first tragedy of human language. If there were only one language in the world, the contact between human beings would definitely be closer, and culture would definitely be more developed. Zamenhof created Esperanto, perhaps moved by this story.</p>
<p>The bottom few floors of the Tower of Babel were always built (and collapsed due to disrepair for many years). There, the languages of various ethnic groups were still connected. From this, it is inferred that the Chinese at that time could directly talk to the British, Egyptians, and Jews. The two words "papa" and "mama" were spoken on the bottom floors, and fortunately, they were not forgotten, and they are still the same all over the world.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Expedition <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Wen</p>
<p>A red flag flutters, a roar sounds.</p>
<p>Wheels rumble, cigarette smoke floats.</p>
<p>Hundreds of youthful faces smile in the window, waving hands fly outside the window.</p>
<p>Ten thousand throats chant tragically, merging into a torrent of uninhibitedness, washing away the barriers of mountains and trees, to call for the performance of an agitation!</p>
<p>The bullet jumps madly in the embrace!</p>
<p>I said: "Be good, and pass through the mountains and passes, you will have a day of freedom; then, I will celebrate your release from shackles."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Introducing New Actors Coming to Shanghai Soon <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>After the renovation of the New Stage, the first batch of Peking Opera actors, Zhao Jinrong, Liang Yunqiu, and Wu Suqiu, three female performers, have decided on the performances. Except that Jinrong plans to stay in Shanghai for a while, and Yunqiu returned to Beijing a few days ago, Wu Suqiu, who is still performing, will finish her contract on the 27th. According to the person in charge of the New Stage, the cast that will replace Wu has been finalized, including Zheng Bingru, Guan Dayuan, Li Hongchun, Yin Jinzhen, Liu Yanting, Song Yuchun, Zhang Lianchang, etc., who will soon set off for Shanghai, and are expected to meet the people of Shanghai in the middle of next month. This group of people may not be familiar to the people of Shanghai, so I will introduce them as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Bingru: A famous female dan in Tianjin and Qingdao. She has been the star attraction in the two major theaters, China and Mingxing in Tianjin, for a long time. Bingru has a fair face, a graceful figure, and a very beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>Guan Dayuan: In recent years, many people have regarded Yu Fugui and Ma Lianliang as the best in sheng, but in fact, there are many who can compete with Tan and Ma. Feng Er (Wang Fengqing) is old, Lao Qing (Gao Qing) has lost his voice, and Guan Dayuan's art is no less than that of Fugui and Lianliang, except that his face is not as agile as Tan and Ma's. Dayuan also has an excellent foundation in martial arts. He is proficient in both civil and military sheng dramas. His masterpieces include fighting plays such as "Dingjun Mountain" and "Pearl Curtain Village." He is also skilled in "Exiting the Box" from "Fighting with Sticks", "Hanging Hair" from "Four Sons Visit Mother", and "Drumming" from "Drumming and Scolding Cao". His voice is also loud, pleasant, and moving. He cooperated with Cheng Yanqiu for a long time in his early years, and also traveled to Japan with Mei Lanfang.</p>
<p>Yin Jinzhen: Specializing in martial arts, he graduated from the Opera School. He is the only open-mouthed jumping talent in the opera school. Among the rising stars, only Jinzhen can compare with Ye Shengzhang. Jinzhen has the temperament of a scholar, is kind and amiable in his dealings with others. At school, he received instruction from the two old opera masters Shen Sanyu and Ding Yongli, and he has studied carefully and diligently. His art is remarkable. He is proficient in all the stunts that a martial arts should have, such as "short steps," "somersaults," "big tops," and "bean scarves." Jinzhen is especially good at the "flying sky sound" technique.</p>
<p>Li Hongchun: A talented disciple of Lao San Mazi Wang Hongshou, he has obtained his true inheritance, and he is proficient in both civil and military Kunqu opera. He is known as the number one red sheng actor in the north, and he is also good at performing labor dramas. He is known as the "Northern Qilin Tong". He specializes in laosheng, and his repertoire is very broad. Wu Yanheng once became one of his followers.</p>
<p>Liu Yanting: Jiazi Hualian. He and Liu Yanfang are brothers, and he followed Yang Xiaolou for many years. He is best at pairing with martial arts dramas, and he also joined Cheng Yanqiu's Qiusheng Society for a time. His voice is slightly poor, but his skills are excellent.</p>
<p>Song Yuchun: Lizih Lao Sheng. He is a disciple of Li Hongchun. He once came to Shanghai with Tan Fuying, but because he imitated Li Hongchun too closely, he is only a mediocre talent.</p>
<p>Zhang Lianchang: Xiaosheng. He came from Fu Liancheng, and he is the senior brother of Du Fulong. His art is on par with Fulong's. This is his first time coming to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned people, it is heard that the New Theater has also retained Lao Dan Li Duokui, Wu Sheng Liang Huichao, Xiao Chou Jia Duocai, and Sun Shengwu. The lineup is evident.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Flattering Eyes <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Flattering eyes refer to eyes that are exquisitely beautiful and captivating, distinguishing them from ordinary eyes. Some call them mesmerizing eyes, suggesting the eyes' power to bewitch and confound the senses, which is also understandable. Others argue they should be called eyebrow-eyes, but everyone has eyebrows and eyes; these are just ordinary eyebrows and eyes, which do not mark them as unique, and are therefore not worthy of the name. Some refer to the ancient saying of eyebrows and eyes conveying affection, taking only a simple allusion to this. It is said that the meaning arrives, but the brush does not reach it, which is a far-fetched argument. Moreover, modern fashionable women mostly draw their eyebrows. Once they are drawn, their beauty or ugliness depends entirely on the skill of the drawing, and cannot be compared with naturally beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Among the dancers of the metropolis, there are two sets of flattering eyes. Yu Meili's are large and flattering; when she glances askance, she seems to be smiling without smiling, and seeing without seeing. Shen Weiying's are small and flattering; even when she looks straight ahead, she seems to be smiling, and she looks exceptionally good from afar. Her younger sister, Weimei, is only shoulder-high, but her eyes are very similar to her sister's. One wonders how many womanizers she will captivate in the future. She can be called little flattering eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Qinzhen, a dancer from the Far East Dance Hall, is known as the queen of eyebrows and eyes. The other day I happened to meet her at the metropolis. I was a guest of her close friend, and was able to invite her to dance. Upon closer inspection, her eyes are actually mesmerizing, not flattering, because both her straight and sidelong glances lack charming allure. However, when she slightly closes her eyes towards someone, accompanied by a faint smile, she truly possesses the power to captivate and seduce. It is said that although she is active in a mid-level dance hall, her monthly earnings from dancing exceed those of even the top stars in high-end dance halls.</p>
<p>Hu Yanyan from Dahua, a native of Wujin, has not been dancing for long and still speaks with a local accent, but her reputation is rapidly rising, almost rivaling Chen Manli. Some say she owes her success to her flattering eyes, but in fact, Yanyan does not have flattering eyes, but beautiful eyes. Her eyes are clear and bright, with distinct black and white, and are purely beautiful, not the kind that glance straight or sidelong. My friend, the portly Mr. Pang, cherishes her as if she were a bright pearl or beautiful jade. The other day he went to Dahua, and she sat at her station for a long time without budging. Mr. Pang, feeling utterly bored, called another hostess to sit with him. The first hostess initially looked displeased, but as she left, she suddenly glanced back and smiled. Mr. Pang's eyes stared straight ahead and his spirit seemed fixed. Another friend said, "How could she not send your soul flying halfway to heaven with that final glance?"</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e105">A Lark Leaving the Valley <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"The Under-Pup"</p>
<p>The rise of a new star may be due to opportunity, but the most essential basic conditions cannot be ignored. After the release of "A Lark Leaving the Valley," eleven-year-old Gloria Jean's name will continue to be deeply imprinted in the minds of movie fans around the world, just like Deanna Durbin's. Naturally, she had the good fortune to be promoted by Universal Studios, but she possesses the basic skills of singing, riding, swimming, and more, which enabled her to complete this movie, "A Lark Leaving the Valley." Moreover, these basic skills determine that she will have even greater development in the future. According to publicity, Gloria Jean's singing is pure high soprano. To our "lay ears," her voice lacks the "sweetness" of Deanna Durbin's, but this may be due to her age, and her voice will certainly change as she gets older. Her acting also feels deeply influenced by Shirley Temple, but the early Shirley Temple still retained a child's innocence and liveliness, which is what makes Gloria Jean so adorable. It is hoped that she will forever maintain the original appearance of a child before she "grows up."</p>
<p>The story of "A Lark Leaving the Valley" was of course tailored for this young actress, but the theme of "summer camp for children" allows children to experience a lively collective life and develop a spirit of self-governance by organizing a "self-government association," which is very meaningful. Watching the groups of children on the screen, all so lively and cute, I can't help but feel that our "child stars" are too restrained. The only regret is that the story is too fragmented, diluting the climax of Jenny and Cecilia competing for the swimming championship.</p>
<p>Wallace Worsley's directorial skills compensate for the shortcomings in the story, and every page and scene is lively and interesting. In particular, Gloria Jean's grandfather and the music director of the children's camp are portrayed humorously, greatly enhancing the film. The acting skills of these two actors are also worth our attention. Gloria Jean was given ample opportunities to act. She was introduced in the opening scene with a "close-up" shot, and later, in scenes such as the farewell at the station, the conflict with Cecilia, helping Jenny win the swimming championship, and accepting her grandfather's advice to apologize to Cecilia, Gloria Jean, who had only received six months of training, was able to achieve such results, proving that her future is limitless.</p>
<p>Nan Grey and Robert Coote are merely Gloria Jean's subordinates, with very few scenes. The girl who played Jenny (Virginia Weidler) is also a promising child star.</p>
