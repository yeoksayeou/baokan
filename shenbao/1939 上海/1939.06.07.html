<h3>經華方大軍截擊　潛江日軍無力續向西犯　華軍一部渡過漢水進擾日後方　黃河缺口擴大隴路日軍受打擊</h3>
<p>樊城　鄂中之日軍自進犯隨棗遭受頓挫後、卽分向襄河下游天門·岳口·應城·皂市·一帶及安陸·應山·方面逃竄、在岳口潛江方面被華大軍截擊、已無力續犯、另有日軍萬餘、近向信陽集結、似續有企圖、華某部已予以嚴密監視、日軍決難得逞、（六日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據中國軍事發言人稱、渡過漢水之日軍、不過一千人、其所以得波之原因、純在利用毒氣，但此一千日軍、已受華方之重大打擊而退去、預料此後日軍不至再作此項渡河冀圖、蓋渡過之人數不多、適足供我消滅、若圖大舉進攻、則其後方交通綫之維護必須有充分之隊部擔任而後可、但就目前在華之日軍力量觀、實已不能有所成就矣、（六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）渡越漢水而佔據潛江之臼軍爲砲隊與步隊、此後未作繼績西犯之企圖、據華方消息、華軍於援軍到後、現向潛江反攻、晉西戰事聞發生於柳林之北、日軍由離石中陽分兩路北犯、以窺黃河東岸、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據中國軍事發言人言、黃河向爲中國之患、唯於目前、已成中國防禦日人唯一之障壁、去年六月問、日軍進駐開對、圖攻鄭州、沿平漢錢而攻武漢之背、賴黃河於此時決口四百公呎、淹地數千畝、始使日軍由此進攻武漢之計劃、完全打銷、其後雖取道長江以攻武漢、然已延長臼軍之攻勢達五個月之久、目今此項黃河缺口、已由四百公呎擴大至一千公呎水量最高時可達一萬五千方呎現時已達一萬二千方公呎、又使日軍無法由此沿隴海綫以西進、按五月華軍游擊隊襲擊開對後、駐在晉省之土肥原師團、曾調至開封、我人疑共有沿此西攻鄭州之意、唯徐州方面遭我游擊隊攻擊之後、開封之土肥原師團、卽重行調至徐州後方、可知新黃河又成日軍前進之障碍、同時臼軍亦已根本放棄由此進攻鄭州之計劃也、（六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據此問接可靠消息、潛江日軍因華軍活躍異常、無法進展、華軍一隊已渡過漢水東岸、擾亂日軍之後方、成脅漢水迤西之日軍撤退、同時華軍積極反攻潛江、逆料該鎮最後命運、日內卽可決定、（六海通社電）</p>
<h3>晉西日軍攻勢已挫中陽西正激戰中　晉南日軍退夏縣</h3>
<p>興集　此次日軍調集新銳兵力、大舉西犯、其河南師團長進駐汾陽、山口旅團長亦到離石指揮、在柳林正面日軍、遭華軍痛繫、未敢再進、故日軍改採迁迥包抄政策、由中離分數路向南北抄襲、圖佔積口·軍渡·三交·各渡口、然後渡河犯陝、連日經華軍分頭痛擊、其勢巳挫、其大兵沿離磧道西犯之日軍、經華軍某旅在王老婆山附近予以痛擊、並由口口兩團在大道兩側伏兵側擊、日軍受創甚重、死傷的五六百名、乃向東南分竄、華軍正肅淸王老婆山之殘餘日軍、繼績向東南挺進追擊中、其由中陽西犯之日軍一部二千餘、二日侵據留讀（中陽西）後、分兩股北犯柳林、一部的三千名、經石崩頭馮家莊竄至馮家岸（留讀東南）、正與華軍某師激戰中、又華軍某師、現進出於三交三大武間、乘虛佔領大武附近喬家山各據點、又華軍口團亦積極在離石東北山活動、離石日軍甚感恐慌、（六日電）</p>
<p>垣曲　晉南臼軍六日起分由張店運城合嶺三路向華軍進犯、華各路大軍已分別挺進迎擊、（六日電）</p>
<p>垣曲　晋南力而三日由北閒到水頭鎮（安邑北）之臼軍爲數千餘、四日午向華方楊村丁村安邑東一帶竄授、當與華軍某鄧遭遇、激戰終日、日軍經華軍猛烈砲火壓迫、傷亡甚多、已向夏縣方面潰退、又三日晨、安邑日軍的二千、經朱家莊竄雙廟韓王一帶、（六日需）</p>
<p>（重慶）據此間所接消息、晉西最近戰局之發展、極堪重視、日軍一萬人、在太原西南一百七十公里處渡過黃河東岸後、分兵三路、進犯軍渡、第一路爲日本在山西省主力、沿公路自離石進攻柳林、第二路自離石進犯磧口、第三路自中陽向西北推進、據稱該區戰事、已迅速演進、成爲大戰、而華軍早有準備、期待已久、衆信晉陝邊區、最近卽將展開激烈大血戰、（六日海通電）</p>
<p>興集　犯柳林日軍正面在梁家會孔家山（柳林東二十餘里）、約五百餘、附砲四門、杏家灣交口日軍均有增加、向華方進犯、右翼日軍四五百、在鋤溝南三十里薛家嶺岸溝一帶、左翼日軍千五百餘、經韓家嶺（柳林北）向南迂迥、企圖包圍柳林、華軍正分路迎繫中、（六日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）中國軍事發言人謂、在晉陝沿黃河一帶、目前戰事極爲猛烈、據稱、日軍之目的、在渡黃河、唯日方新兵開抵晉省者不過一萬人、此一萬人抵晉省後、僅足以補充損失、故於實力方面並未增加、且自武漢淪陷而後、晉省日軍屢圖渡河、但每决皆歸失敗、預料今次之渡河企圖仍將歸於失敗也、（六日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>租界與戰爭</h3>
<p>「日本之眞正仇敵，不在中國，而在中國境內之租界」，此昨日路透社東京電所傳日本報紙「都新聞」之見解也。如是云云，殆人人得由直覺斷言其爲意氣之談；發於意氣，詎中事理，似可存而不論。然無問古今，無問東西，人類之史蹟爲意氣所促成者多，爲理智所支配者少；故在理智之倫，貴乎善馭一己之意氣，而不容漠視他人之意氣。况默榮日本之對華作爲，由於意氣者允十八九；至少如啓釁蘆溝橋而遽調重軍入山海關，又如啓釁虹橋飛機塲而遽調海軍脅吳淞口，中日問題遂不可收拾而至於交戰，迄今日而爲第二十四月之始矣；夫豈理智之舉，實爲意氣所驅；循是言之，豈敢菲薄都新聞！</p>
<p>租界之於中國，不難就歷史說明其由來，就地理說明其界綫，就法理說明其本質，就治理說明其體系；然論其關係，推其影響，析其善惡禍福利害得失，則極複雜微妙之致；不但種種矛盾雜然並存，且向矛盾之多方面演進幻變於不已。爲作簡明之輸廓，準確之概念，大不易也，是以歷來中外人士之於租界：乃或嚮往之，或憎惡之；或珍惜之，或敝屣之；或信以前途無量，或疑以瞬歸毀滅；或視如天堂，凡百福利之源泉；或視如地獄，凡百罪惡之淵蔽。蓋以其本質之多元，遂蒙逈殊之估價；平時旣然，及中日交戰而租界本質所涵之矛盾暴露愈甚。日人對華發動武力侵略之後，在軍事經濟外交各方面，遭遇始料所不及之煩悶，姑莫謂無從解脫此煩悶之移果，抑且無從解答此煩悶之前因；不自反省而怨天允人，天人悠悠而遷怒租界，於是若有所獲而日仇敵在此矣，</p>
<p>租界何足爲日本仇敵哉？中國抗戰之物質，以廣大之內地爲基礎，田野邱壑森林礦產皆是也，租界如彈丸，何足道。中國抗戰之精神，在耐勞耐苦，不屈不撓，生息內地之軍民，居租界者質量俱百一耳。中國抗戰武器之輸入，自粵東陷而惟西北西南是從，豈猶賴租界爲吞吐。中國抗戰之制勝，在悠久之時間，遼闊之空間；雙方勝敗之因素，全不在乎租界。申言之，今日之租界而爲華人控制，何裨於抗戰，租界而爲日本控制，何損於中國抗戰之前途，又何裨於日本之作戰。抑租界與戰爭，非惟無關係，且有密切關係；關係惟何：勝屬日本，則日本必視租界如禁臠，勝屬中國，則租界必以中國復興大業而空前繁榮；故謂戰　運命，繫於租界，斷無是理；租界運命實視戰爭最後結局而轉移，是因租界在中國而謂先天註定者可也。此種密切之關係，此種必然之因果，舉世所熟知；若爲意氣所驅，企圖變更租界之運命於戰局決定勝敗之前，則猶揠苗助長，手刃之不啻也。何也：保全租界端賴各方合作，而毀滅租界則任何一方俊爲之也。是以吾人旣勸勉租界內華人以自重，復欲正告日人母錯覺租界爲仇敵！</p>
<p>意氣之談，無當於事理，無益於現實；但鼓煽意氣而導多人於意氣，甚至形成意氣之行動，則不但無當無益，且以誤入歧途而自貽伊戚。故中國方面若不能洞察區區租界之無　戰局，在租界內不能自重，馴至導租界於毀滅、則國際對中國之同情，將有不良之轉變。日本方面若以仇敵視租界，則租界固國際之炸彈也；日本爆炸之，行見太平洋沸騰！</p>
<h3>日要求引渡恐怖分子　津英總領已允移交　奉英政府訓令交付一部份　惟犯罪無證據者逐出租界</h3>
<p>（天津）據今日此間日方消息、五月三十一日日方要求英租界當局須將暗殺津關監督程錫庚以及其他反日恐怖份子移交日方之哀的美頓書、已爲英國總頒事所拒絕、英國總領著之理由、卽現在拘押中之華人、是吾爲刺程之要犯毫無證據可見、日方官員接獲此項答覆之後，卽討論如何實施哀的美頓書中所開「自由行動」之辦法、按日方要求移交兇手之哀的美頓書、乃由日本駐津總領事田中於五月三十一日向英國駐津總領事提出者、並要求英方之答覆不能延至本月七日、同時英國領事署方面對於日牒、不願予以批評、但謂此項牒文、雖附有答覆之期限、但不能認爲正式之哀的美頓書（六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（天津）據此問臼方消息、英國駐津總領事今日下午三時曾奉本國政府命訪問日本駐津總領事、表示將日方所稱之恐怖份子移交與日方（六日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透社自官方探悉、英政府已訓令天津英總領事哲美遜、將所捕挾有炸彈之二華人、交與日當局、暗殺前天津海關監督程錫庚之嫌疑犯數人、如無實在犯罪之證據、則悉將逐出租界、故此後犯重大罪案之諸犯、將交與事實上之當局、犯輕罪者悉將逐出租界、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）中國駐英大使郭泰祺　今日下午再訪英外部、抗議天津英租界將所謂恐怖份子引波日方事、郭氏此舉、係奉蔣委員長之手發訓令、蓋蔣委員長對此問題極爲關切、（六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>渝報切盼　英蘇合作</h3>

<h3>歐局近頃的經緯　倫敦通訊　地中海上的風雲</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>里維諾夫辭了職之後，接着，英蘇開當時在密雲不雨着的談判，就鬆了下來。現在，本來預備到日內瓦去開會的蘇聯代表，現仟外决的泡丹姆金，在幾天前，却忽然中止了預定的行程。於是英蘇間已經進行到相常程度的合作談判，方始暫時擱置。以目前的情形判斷，大概在最近，道談判是不會眞被重新强調起來的。</p>
<p>這種英蘇間談判的擱置，實際上僅僅是一個現象，一個結果，而絕不是原因。她的原因是什麽呢？中要而又直接的，一共有兩僩：第一，在光明方面，楚由於最近英土公的的成立·因而從央國立塲看，她已經把未來的英蘇同盟基礎，完全植下了；現在，環繞在蘇聯一週的國家，大多已經和英國有了相互或片面援助的協定；這，在她想，已經表示了對蘇聯合作的完全誠意，至於進一步確定她和蘇聯間條的上的同盟關係，那，祇楚一個程序問題；然而這程序，在英國目前還沒有下最大決心，打擊全世界侵略集團國時，她是不感到必要的。從蘇聯立塲看，因爲不久前，泡丹姆金到巴爾幹半島及波蘭一行之後，他巳經確定了各國對蘇的信賴，所以在周圍各國巳經和英國成立了同盟之後，事賽上，她也不必亟亟於去和英國同盟。於是在本質上，英國苟安下來了，蘇聯也懈怠下來了。第二，在黑暗方面，最近英國內部，因爲墨索里尼在都林比較和平的演說一發表，對德讓步派的勢力，又抬了頭；他們還在勸現政府對德冉作一决嘗試，以某種可能讓步，作爲希特勒接受「和平」的條件，而請他具體地提了出來。於是，現在駐德大使漢德生，就接到了命令，立刻向德國當局提出兩點意見去：（一）如果德國眞是希望「和平」的話，那未，應當趁現在英國還「願意聽」的時候，趕緊提出來；（二）不然的話，依他「個人的」章見，英國現在，已經完全立於對德優越的國際軍勢地位上了。所以，當英國在本質上巳經苟安了之後，在外表上，她故實弄得如火如茶，成大地在宜稱着談判英。蘇。合作，而另一面，又在幕後進行着對德討價還價的交涉的時候，這時，爲了外交的運用，蘇聯就採取了泡丹姆金的忽然中止日內瓦之行。</p>
<p>這樣一來，英。蘇，談判，就暫時攔置了起來。順帶着，而也短時期緩弛下來的，是歐洲的整個局勢。不過大家應當立卽密切地注意到：在另一面，英·蘇·的常局，却因此父墜入緊張的網；蘇·德·的緩衝可能，是不楚又在進展？—像一僩毒蟲似的，這問題，在目前是一直頑固地，，着英·法·苟安論者們的心。</p>
<p>於是這一兩天來，英·法·的與論，又在聲勢蓬勃地，壓迫着政府；而政府也祇得冉趕緊採取步驟，去向蘇聯担保。</p>
<p>作爲未來哈立法克斯和龐萊巴黎談話最主要項目之一的，就是這。</p>
<p>這些，就是歐洲目前最主要的趨向。可楚在這裹，我們碰到了一個問題；爲什麽？在且前旣然英·法·祇望和蘇聯保持不卽不離的一致立塲，主要的楚去和德·意·講價的時候，但一聽到德·蘇。緩衝的音影，却又這麽焦急了起來？</p>
<p>這問題的答案，目前設緊急的一點，是在於地中海形努的緊張，所以目前全歐洲的目光，却在集中於地中海上正在發展中的風雲演要。</p>
<p>現在，請大家打開歐洲地圖。在地中海的圾西一端，作爲入海唯一孔穴的，楚世界聞名的直布羅陀海峽，在最東一端，是聊接了紅海的蘇伊士運河。誰都知道，這是英·法·兩國海上交通的最大命綫，可是，同時誰也都知道，這是德·意。發展夢想廿大帝國的唯一最基本的根據地。</p>
<p>記者前决通訊，曾指陳過德·意·在非洲近來的一些軍事上的準備，和政治上的陰謀。那裹所指的非洲部份，就是坐落在地中海的半腰。自然，那些準備和陰謀，近來並沒有停頓，而反在加緊；不過，却也沒有值得注意的新的發展。現在引起我們注目的，却在地中海的兩端；西端，是西班牙情勢的推移；東端，楚巴爾幹各國的彷徨歧路。—說起根本來，是一個東西：德·意·的壓力在加緊。</p>
<p>（一）西班牙的情勢最近有兩椿最值得注意的事：一，是德國艦隊的居然離開；另一，是戈林預定的西班牙之行，突然作罷。這些，是表示着一件事；德·意·對佛朗哥施以壓力，使他變爲完全俯首帖耳的奴隸過程上，又有了問題。</p>
<p>當然，佛朗哥終於依然是奴隸，可是，問題儘管不大，但也還是存在着的。</p>
<p>問題在那裹呢？大家都知道，佛朗哥已經接受了德·意。的壓力，加入了「防共協定」；叉把所有的土地，幾乎都已獻給了德·意·的戰略家，作爲他們未來對央·法·戰爭的根據地，而預先佈置着。不過，有一椿事，他一直到現在，還沒有接受；那是：在正式慶祝內戰勝利的那天，向英國明白地直出收回失地　直　羅陀海峽裹的英屬直布羅陀軍港。對這，佛朗哥一直是在拒絕着；因爲他對英·法·借款的想頭，始終沒有斷過。於是，慶祝勝”的日子，就一再改期了；而相應着爲英·法·所圾　心　德·意·掃退志願兵的問題，德·意·方面，也就一直不肯讓步。</p>
<p>這種殭持的局面，一直到了圾近，却忽然釀出了兩個非常車大的內政與外交纏起來的危機；依了德國爲背景，西班牙最反動的法西斯派的首領，現在內長的松納爾（Suner）近來，在計劃着取佛朗哥而代之的政治陰謀，，是突然暴露了。這令佛朗哥對德國大大地不高興了起來。於是，作爲一種示威起見，他一面以書面要求德·意·先把他們比英·法軍優越的地方，顯示給他看；吾則，他不願公開反英，另一面，他向英國的大使說，事實上，他是終於會和德·意·分手的，不過「時機還沒有成熱」。像這種情勢發展下去，不是佛朗哥的完全屈服或被根本推倒，那末，國際上鬥爭的勢力，是有藉了西班牙的舞台，再來一决內亂可能的。同時，在那佛朗哥統治下的西班牙，前政府軍的舊勢力，又楚在這裹那裹地潛伏着，等待再出現的機會。這，就是目前第一個危機。某决，爲了澈底根絕英國在西班牙金融勢力侵入的可能，近來德國駐西班牙的大使，忽然奉到了命令；根據這，他會向佛朗哥提出警告：目前一般認爲親英色彩太重的佛朗哥的最大金融支持者的馬區（Mareh）必須立刻排去；然而佛朗哥却竟然予以拒绝。於是，這在現在就又造成了德‘意。與佛朗哥之間的另一緊張，而成爲危機的第二件。（未完）</p>

<h3>紀念敎師節　獻給賢明的敎師們</h3>
<p>— 章陀</p>
<p>賢明的敎師們、敎育是國家的命脈、她是抗戰必勝的主要因素、她是戰後建國的永久基礎、你們所負的責任、何等重大、</p>
<p>可是、請大家捫心自問、過去從事敎育事業、盡過多少力量、對於一般靑年、有無對不起的地方你所得到的敎靑效果、對社會、影響怎樣、對國家能否交賬、</p>
<p>賢明的敎師們、</p>
<p>你們是靑年輩的導師、你們的言行、需要以身作則、更須盡量發揚我們的積極性、避免過去數千年來習染很深的消極性、例如、懷疑·麽擦·息惰·逸樂等、都楚偏於消極方面的、不但不能促進一切事業、反而消耗了許多有用的精神、阻碍不少的進步、甚至躭誤了國家的大事、我們每個人、都要以國家民族的利益、放在第一位、我們要爲國家民族而宜傳、爲國家民族而行動、爲國家民族而思想，總之、我們要爲國家民族而從事敎靑、</p>
<p>賢明的敎師們、</p>
<p>我始終相信、敎師的優良與吾、只消問他、對國家民族的信仰堅定吾、對敎育的本質上、有深切的認識吾、能吾以敎育爲終身事業、能吾視學生爲自已子女、我更相信、敎育上無所謂敎學法、只有忠實二字、才是敎學的不二法門、敎師的態度、應該具備三個條件、學不厭、敎不倦，行不惑、學不厭、是求知的前進、敎不倦、是敎學的努力、行不惑、是意志的堅決、此三者、非但是敎師應有的態度、並日是敎師的正確的人生觀、賢明的敎師們、</p>
<p>世界上勞苦功高的人、舍你們其誰、而罪孽深重的人、又合你們其誰、因爲兒童羣、和靑年羣的前進與墮落、救國與賣國、建國與害國、都操在你們的手掌之中、所以你們並不僅僅乎是學生們的領導者、實在是整個國家民族的導師呀、可楚、你們所負的責任、旣然如此重大、而你們所得到的待遇、父甚菲薄、而你們仍能誨人不倦、埋頭苦幹、你們這種偉大的犧牲精神、莫不欽佩和感激、我代表全國同胞、向你們致敬、</p>

<p>溯自英法對華事件、處處承認現實狀况、轉使一方氣燄愈張、大有加入德意以威脅英法之可能、因之英法在遠東利益岌岌可危、且關鹽各稅侵占殆盡、本息無着、所借與之滙兌平準基金、復因維持黑市之故、轉輾及從多方面爲日方吸收以去、致歐洲方面對於中國債券不無相當懷念、因之一週以來外債所跌有如下列、</p>

<p>內債暗盤、昨日市况盤旋之後、疲而復與、多方壁壘極爲堅强、賣方終覺力弱、樓面形勢最堪注意、即每逢行市稍小、交易頓形减色、市價稍高、則又興高彩烈、騾見熱鬧、可以見大多數之人心、對於公債信仰極堅、蓋以戊種行將舉行第七决抽籤、各統一公債均將付息、因此放空者均有戒心、環境旣無變化、人心亦見安定、且以美法大使聯袂赴渝、謂與戰事有關、故多方之心更堅、咋日經過、上午開盤時、三十五號頗有進胃、市價曾一度稍堅、繼以賣氣較湧、裕源潤利賣出爲多、永康樂茂松茂亦有吐出、雖五號叫十六號以及同康稍有吸收、仍未能穩定、丙種曾破入三元大關、後市潤利轉賣爲買、同康轉買爲賣、可見人心毫未一致、惟三十五號則繼續買進、大豐亦漸有吸胃、聯和巳止賣、散戶則賣出爲多、大都紊亂不定、市價結果·甲·乙·丙·三種無榮辱、丁·戊兩種各小一角、成交總數共計五十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易未有成交、惟南洋兄弟烟草公司股賣方索價七元七角、尚未成交、</p>
<p>衆業公所、股市開盤略形疲軟、但未幾即見買戶衆多、市氣亦即活躍而堅挺、怡和股數週無上落、昨日突轉卓越、買戶爭購、由十八元八角漲至十九元六角、國際信託股漲至五元、及揚子銀公司股漲至八元、均似挺硬、耶松股略佳價一百十元（除息四元）、業廣股穩定、價九元八角、墾殖股成交雖甚巨、但價格變動甚微、開平股隨倫敦價格上升、而漲至三十一元五角、電力六兩優先股、前因有二遺產、其中持有多數該項股票、而欲淸理而售出、但現料該股業巳售擊、故漲至一百二十八一元半、</p>

<p>中國營業公司八厘債券、由六十兩劇漲至七十三兩、債券雖漲至七十三兩、但與普通股價叫角比較、仍形低廉、今以此而計算、則每百兩之八厘債券、照市價等於普通股二百六十叫股、然以八厘債券計算所值應較上述之普通股數爲多、今以普通股價爲叫角、則債券可值一百零五兩六錢、然後終有一日使二項價值軋平、非普通股價降低、即債券價上漲、</p>

<h3>紗花　駭人聽聞　單紗慘跌四十七元</h3>
<p>紗市下游、跌勢益劇、客帮銷路停滯、人心衰弱、浮多稍有吐出、檯面鬆懈、至於連朝猛騰之三二支天女單紗、因需要缺乏、反映騾起、忽落四十七兀、詛料午後湖南帮略進幾、包、漲勢復升、回高二十元、此、種在上在下之局勢、商塲上難以想見也、實則依然已入高峰、變遷因之浩大、查市上實銷固沉悶、散多照市脫卸、然大戶某二公司仍來拖進、潮汕帮在圾近幾日中·辦貨甚夥、當然有一度休憩、須待稍形消化、再來採辦、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業相聚、主論溫和、一般流動掮客四處探詢下來、客帮無辦貨舉動、形勢怠懈、開價即跌四五元之譜、二十支雙馬現貨價爲叫百二十八九元、棧單價爲四百二十元、連日飛騰之三二支單紗客胃停滯、買者缺乏、天女成交僅三包、比上日慘落四十七元、爲六百十五元、然額子多者、仍不願出售、中送因價落未免太巨、某棉行突來收進二十支雙地球、頃刻回上幾元、收盤雙馬現貨價爲四百三十元、棧單價爲四百二十四元半、午後香港帮稍有購買、市狀轉靜、三二支天女單紗湖南帮進十五包、價格復漲二十元、爲六百三十五元、二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百三十元〇五角、棧單價爲四百二十五元牛、查全日各帮買去統計一千四百二十五包、行情三二支天女單紗比上日價猛落二十七元、二十支雙馬跌三元、牧羊跌三元、雙地球跌一元、十支童子軍雙地球均跌一·二元、申新廠開出五支二股童子軍一百五十包、價爲三百五十兀、（全劃頭）六至九月期出貨、榮豐廠開出十八支金橋七十五包、價爲三百三十五元、七月至九月期出貨、合豐廠開出八支人鐘一百包、價爲三百五十元、（全劃頭）六月至九月期出貨、今日有棉紗三百七十件運天津、一百件運烟台、一千二百七十件運汕頭、六百十件運香港叫百二十件運廣州灣六百二十五件運北海、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>日紗市面始好繼平、結果與上日無大雙化、北路一帶、稍有生意因之市象路昂、二十支月琴本月份價爲三百七十一元半收盤、</p>
<h3>外棉售價日高　廠商難以下手</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市殊呈活躍、因各方謠傳易貨之說頗爲濃厚、日來布疋銷數大增、引起國內外各方之購買、允以歐洲帮爲最、然政府之貸款棉、迄今尚無放出消息、市上現貨異常稀薄、因之售價高昂、七月份巳至九分十八之新高價、按照目前趨勢、尚有繼續上漲之可能也、咋日紐的漲十至十五磅音、印度連同價測猛漲三羅比、埃及漲二十磅音、折合法幣棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲一元六角，印棉漲一元二角、埃及棉漲一元八角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因海外棉市步漲·各方購意頗濃、而竟無能下手、故祇能暫抱觀望、昨日同業中對於印棉十支原料平果兒略有交易、咋日共進一千包、俱爲六七月份裝船、廠方均無交易聞、茲將咋日棉市折合送廠價列下、</p>
<p>中棉生意　依然入於停頓狀態中、至於外棉、近兩日來塊角逐步上升、換算價大昂、各方面對於購訂一層、亦束手觀望、因之中外棉交易俱見汾寂、現棉僅一筆成交、下沙打包花同業中進一百二十五件、價一百七十九元三角、匯劃棧交、蘇北到通花一百十包云、今日有棉花三十件運香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　新蘭運滬　傳說紛歧　行不得也可奈何</h3>
<p>滬杭綫已收乾薾、來滬之期依然渺茫、且謠言甚多、深使業中人焦急異常、現由某方傳出消息、關於解決春繭來滬之「辦法」有二、據云一爲所有鮮藕、可納若千「捐稅」運至滬上、唯有一附帶條件、即此項乾薾繅製成絲之後、必須售於某日商出口行出口、方可通行、其二爲「華中」擬以所收之乾蘭之半數、以「華興」鈔强迫薾商售予、方可運至上海云、此兩點在未證實之前、祇能以謠言視之、不過此二謠言、亦有其發生之根源、卽日人侵略中國、亦卽獨佔中國市塲、亦即排擠英美法在華之經濟利益是也、然則以扣留蘭子作爲必須售於日人商行出口之條件、良亦可能也、但覺此等方法、似太愚拙耳、其二、「華中」擬强迫收賣一半之說、則爲刦掠全部之序曲、以後發展如何、還須事實證明、關於蔽訊之比較確實及或可窺其內慕之一二之消息者、厥爲日商洋行所傳「華中」內部、因對於刦奪此項物質之意見和利益矛盾、巳發生控案數件云云、似較有價值、然據業內中人云、浙路春蘭如是阻礙重重者、前往收蘭之上海絲廠、亦當負一部責任、即嘉湖區　廠寥寥所促成之鮮繭集中、繭價低落（僅及無錫區之半數）、此種賤價收繭、亦近乎發國難財者、自爲偽組織及侵略者所紅眼、再加上戰後各種特殊條件、乃有此螳螂捕蟬、黃雀在後之一幕、强中自有强中手、執筆至此、誠堪一嘆耳、（祥</p>
<h3>海外絲價反動　本市絲銷活躍</h3>
<p>國外絲市、昨已反動激漲、橫濱現貨漲四十元、遠期漲二十七元、紐的近期漲一角、遠期漲八分、現貨日絲漲四分至五分、上海絲廣東絲各漲五分、足證日前本刊預測之不謬、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、前週跌後、即轉寂境、昨爲海外絲價上騰激動、英美法絲銷、才同呈活躍、仁昌仁記達昌等行、昨吸購均增、惜因廠商持價尚堅、故成交祗達一百担、售開行盤、計白廠經八五分高勻度價一九三〇元、七八分粗條紋價一八七〇元、XB價一八二〇兀、斑馬等級一八四〇元、已興絲價暴跌前不相上下、</p>
<h3>金融　金市盤旋　交易極淸</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、先跌繼漲、呈盤旋之勢、初因現金號賣意殷濃、兼某金號多頭亦稍來斬結、市象軟弱、嗣散戶趁低吸購、且華南帮亦來活動、逐漸轉堅、終反軋漲三元、交易寥寥無幾、全天祇做開三百餘兩、銀樓飾金掛小一元、海關金仍平、中英純金等略向下挫、</p>
<p>炩赤暗市軋　二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開市勢仍疲、首由現金號塞予某錢兌業共七十兩、二千〇九十三元爲開盤價、較之前收做低一元、不久某金號多頭亦來斬結、售予錢兌業百兩、價均九十二元、時散戶趁低吸收。且客帮亦有買意、因之逐步回高、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價九十三元、俄又進同業二十兩、價九十四元、後某金號（代華南帮）進證劵帮五十兩、價竟躍起二元、爲九十六元、此後供求轉稀、延至午時未見做開、故午收仍作九十六元、午後塲內頗形淸靜、久無成交、直至三時三刻、始見現金號賣予某錢兌業五十兩、價仍九十六元爲狀頗平、延至晚收價仍爲二千〇九十六元、結果比上日軋漲二元、全天僅四元高低、現金號之本牌金書出價一千一百元、收進二千〇九十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均有行無市、</p>
<p>飾金昨已掛小一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時因聞烚赤市勢仍疲、故亦掛小一元、大同行改懸二百十三元、新同行爲二百十一元、收進二百〇五允、</p>
<p>英純金回落半便士</p>
<p>五日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊績見高昂、故每盎斯疲落半辦士、計退達七鎊八先令四辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦跌至一千二百十一元三角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦掛小三角、計一千二百〇六元六角、</p>
<h3>外滙期貨　供給較旺</h3>
<p>滙市昨英美互滙、漲勢漸勁、計又升一厘三至一八七五、洋行結款增多、華行亦進多出少、本市外滙、本應英緊美鬆、但因英行匯豐·麥加利·仍維持照八辨士二五原價供給英金、而美行　不肯以鬆價吐出美金、致英美兩滙、現貨一致趨平、期貨雖有華行購吸、而外商銀行供意甚佳、致稍帶硬、交易上午尚旺下午轉淸、港滙因外行賣胃未健、故稍趨軟化、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均長〇六二五紐的銀價呆定倫敦生金縮半辨士、滙兌英對美大一厘三、對滬·對法均平、美對英漲一八七五、對滬升二分、對法昂一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英滙八辨士二五、美滙十六元〇九三七五、較之前收、均無軒輕、開後洋行結款雖繁、但因銀行頗肯塞出、致乏變化、計洋行首先扒結匯豐·麥加利現貨英金八辨士二五、繼又購進華比現貨美滙十六元〇九三七五、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大半分、計徵百分之五·〇〇、時洋行再來結進華比七月份美滙十六元、後華行亦跟踪吸納安達·荷蘭八月份美滙爲十五兀九三七五、市况穩中似稍帶硬、將近午刻、僅有港匯買賣、計錢兌業扒結外行荷蘭現貨價祇五十五元一二五、爲狀稍軟、午收銀行現貨賣價、英美兩匯、與晨開不相上下、港滙五十五五元一二五、</p>
<p>後市交易突稀、美港二匯、且未聞做開、英匯亦僅七月份略有成交、計華行互做、與孟買銀公司賣予東方價均八辨士二一八七五、是以價亦鮮榮辱、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英滙八辨士二五、美滙十六元〇九三七五、結果較隔咋晚收、英美滙現貨仍平、期貨穩中略硬、港滙照成交價軋過、則軟一二五、</p>
<h3>日鈔大票　需要頓旺</h3>
<p>昨日英純金跌半便士、英美滙兌未動、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、銀行供給暢達、烚赤開盤、金號供塞、市况微軟、入後錢兌業買意忽濃、趁低吸納、市價欲跌反漲、轉趨堅挺、下午供求較稀、勢甚穩定、結果校上日漲二元、外幣英美金鎊、供求勢均、市况穩定美金鎊與英金鎊相軋而微升、英美金票、交易甚暢、均以需要增而趨升、香港票需要甚殷、而遭票趨緊、市價復昂、法郎票供求未盛、市况穩定、義大利票需要復殷、價續昂貴、日幣供求頗形活躍、市况小票賤、大票貴、小票爲十元·五元·一元等票、大票爲五十元·一百元·五百元·一千元等票、平時市價以小票爲標準、大小票價之相差、僅高一分或僅二三厘、昨日某外銀行需要大票日幣數萬元、錢兌業遂塞小進大、以應需耍、致大小票相差竟達三分、精於盤算取巧、誠業外人所不能及也、日金票晨做九角一分七厘、後因供給趨盛、降至九角一分五厘、下午回漲至九角二分、朝鮮票晨做八角三分、會降至八角二分五厘、結果爲八角二分七厘、公會交易甚稀、僅鎮興出同豐進美金票八百元、咋日市價、英金票升二分美金鎊升一角、美金票升二厘、香港票升一厘、義大利票升一分、其他各幣俱無更動、</p>
<h3>糧食　各地新麥　紛紛佈樣</h3>
<p>新麥自前日首批上市後、各地麥樣、均巳紛紛寄滬、聞附近吳淞一帶、亦有新樣呈市、品質尚佳、叉聞二批陳墓新麥續到四十餘包、價開五元叫角六分、因係直接配與日廠、故無正式公開市面、按目下各地新麥紛紛登塲、適遇滬廠所定洋粉與陳麥相繼到埠之際、市面難以振舊、預測本年麥市漲風、當在上市之後、因其環境與往昔不同也、若以目前而論、殊無佳象之可言、</p>
<h3>洋粉到十萬包　出口粉六萬包</h3>
<p>粉市趨勢續定、本客交易、均無熱烈動態、因前定六月一日進口之「雪來」號所裝洋粉、現已抵滬、額計十餘萬包、市存又見充實、聞蝙蝠牌已降至四元三角半、中檔牌子僅售四元三角之滙劃、際此新麥上市之秋、紛價前途、尚須看小、故整批客銷、除洋粉擇廉稍有成交外、對於廠粉需要、殊爲零星而廠方亦恐跌價仍難動銷，故暫爲保守原盤、二號粉仍爲四元四角滙劃，由本客成交的三萬餘包、市面前途、一時恐不易開展、</p>
<p>出口、麺粉七日出口、二萬二千一百包運天津、五千句運烟台三萬零二百五十包運汕頭、二千包運廈門、又有麩皮三白包運廈門、四百五十包運香港、</p>
<h3>粳秈銷路較活　洋米貶價求脫</h3>
<p>杜粳　昨日各帮來源河下共到松江帮二號、車輪包子同崑黎等區二千六七百包、徘徊市况、無甚變化、惟天時陰雨、人心略堅、而本街銷塲、稍見動辦·囤戶亦稍授受、故若厚薄粳價、結果除中决削短之貨暗挺幾分外、其餘則仍乏榮辱、</p>
<p>客秈昨日本街辦胃甚濃、統市成交有三千餘包、多數爲店鋪工廠之實銷、囤戶問津不多、因此雖在杭硤等內地帮去胃轉懈之際、咋市售價反見續漲一角半左右、內地帮成交僅千包、因連日暢辦後、存貨尚未裝淸、而內地售價亦已回平、大概需要漸足、後首去量或須逐决减少也、杜洋尖及埠尖、仍以客秈銷活市頗堅挺、</p>
<p>洋米　迄乏大戶問津、而棧囤亦以天熱求脫、且定貨到埠漸近、市形逐呈平軟、昨開出西貢數十包、價又小一角、爲十八元八角、、而靈一星配客仍喊十九元二三角運费送到、</p>
<p>糯米　昨日變元米一因價高、二以洋爲傾軋、銷路殊滯、故市、呈平疲之象耳、</p>
<h3>雜糧　嘉定新蠶豆　津帮所辦最旺</h3>
<p>昨臼新蠶豆乃第二朝上市、到頭除靑蠶豆仍祇零星小數外、惟嘉定白蠶豆頗見湧到、致市况雖在天津帮辦胃旺盛之態度下、但其行價未能上砌、昨計嘉定白蠶豆共開九百餘包、由津帮辦去三分之二、餘爲本街分去、價爲六元七角原盤、新靑蠶豆來源不湧、故貨主扳高緊售、最高價曾放至七元八角、但爲數祇十餘包、昨統市共計成交牌樓市貨二十餘包、價爲七元四角至五角、閔行貨妥交二百餘包價自七元二角半至八角、去路除本街爲大宗外、共他廈門帮亦辦去幾十包云、</p>
<h3>油餅　新菜油軋脚　生豆油守原盤</h3>
<p>豆餅期現價平行</p>
<p>生油　近兩日生豆油市况、無甚過份變遷貨方爲因本高利薄、大都不願鬆售、然各地銷塲一因新菜油軋脚、二則端節關係、以致購辦力减色、故昨市形呈優擯局面、市塲中祗做烟台聽裝花生油一百聽、價爲叫十元原盤、其他豆油等均無市、</p>
<p>豆餅　六月份期貨日商洋行巳在解貨、市况因被有力囤戶把持、故一部份零星空戶抵補、交易見勁、致市穩定、昨成交六月份源記一萬餘片、價爲二元八角二分至八角三分、雜牌五千片價爲二元七角半、現餅去路雖細、但因本月份之期餅售價高過現餅、故在貨戶拉抬之下、上漲三四分、計成交源記一千片、價爲二元八角、雜牌、一千五百片、價爲二元七角四分至五分、刻下期現行情巳相平行、</p>
<h3>疋頭　期貨細布　廠盤提升　綸昌麻紗供給斷絕　東疋自貨需要激增</h3>
<p>國布白貨細布·細斜連日走銷頗暢、同業手貨漸告售罄、各廠六七月份期貨細布、細斜訂開一千餘包、價較市盤每疋昂一角之譜、致手貨市盤亦轉緊張、申新富貴細布加一角售開、大鵬呌盤亦漲一角、溫州帮購胃續强、成交十二磅·十一磅細布一百包、細斜紋因染色斜紋客銷頗佳、染廠吸收殊力、昨又成交近百件、每疋漲價一角至二角、恰和粗布業外囤戶轉出三百餘包、由本街批發號吸納轉銷浙東溫州、本街囤戶及門市批發去路購進各廠輕重磅各檔五六十件、蘇北購辦九磅粗布十餘件、售盤穩定、漂染布疋客路以溫州帮需耍續佳、辦色布·色斜·綫呢·直貢·印花貨五十餘箱、汕頭帮一部份客戶止裝、而其他客戶仍儘量發裝、川滇帮新添辦、以色斜最夥、計二千餘疋、深色貨市盤堅定、惟淺色貨因時令關係、門莊銷塲爲主、市盤頗顯紊亂景象、獨綸昌出品勿落色蔴紗·蔴紡·花布正當門市旺銷時期、日銷的在一二千疋、今受罷工影響、供給斷絕、熱銷花樣、脫售後已無補充、零疋批發祇肯勉强應酬、</p>
<p>東疋白貨昨因本街染銷去路續旺、市盤益挺、細布行情現貨、互有參差、結果堅定、而下月期貨則每疋一致升漲五分至一角、細斜實需激增、現期貨俱漲一角至一角半、同業色布字號及染廠商採納細布·細斜綜計五千件左右、市氣良好、有續升之望、</p>
<p>出口七日疋頭出口、八十五件運天津、十五件運烟台、十四件運厦門、二百九十件運汕頭、三十六件運香港、八十件運廣州灣、六十五件運北海、九十五件運海防、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白復跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫裁電訊、近期復小一辦士、遠期小二五、八月份爲六先令九辦士、十二月份五先令丸辦士七五、明年三月份六先令〇二五、故本市公會劃盤跌風復熾、現貨二四粗白本棧降二角、以二十六元半成交五十包、外棧降三角、爲二十六元二角、轉口貨降四角、以十七元九角、劃出一百五十包、太古車白B嘜小三角、西棧一十五元九角、東棧二十五元六角半、成交二百包、西棧CW嘜二十五元七角CX嘜二十五元半、東棧DY嘜二十四元七角、二百包、HX嘜二十四元六角、一百包、本廠綿白降半元、振記一號二十六元、二三四號逐檔遞退、荷赤及車赤等均呌原價、無成交、國產刁靑、據鼓嶼息、因溫州市價轉企、前每包價曾降至十八元者、現已激漲至二十五元、故大都運往該處應銷矣昨由香港裝來糖一百包、汕頭來八十八包、</p>
<h3>進出口貨物到多出少</h3>
<p>昨日來滬貨物有米一千一百三十包、由香港運來、叉洋碱四百十包、天津裝來、靑島來豆油一千五百五十件、豆餅五千片、今（七日）出口貨有豆子二百四十包、運往廈門茶葉二百五十件、運往天津、</p>

<p>日司態度强硬</p>
<p>大光社云、記者對此案連日分訪江海關當局、探詢處理辦法、無如關防嚴密、故訪晤海關高級人員十分困難、昨晨上午十時、再赴海關、分晤西籍華籍關員、結果、據稱日籍稅務司自接受日海軍當局之請求後、即按照日海軍規定辦法施行、現雖引起各國之注意、但日籍稅務司態度至爲强硬、海關稅務司羅福德、現正與各方交換意見、決本海關條例、設法取締是項通告、俾海關行政、不爲紊亂、</p>
<p>暫改結關地名</p>

<h3>桐油專家談　中美桐油貿易前途　美植桐漸進步但產量尙有限　今後數年仍將仰賴中國供給</h3>
<p>桐油爲中國輸出貿易中之大宗商品、允以中美間貿易額爲最鉅、茲據熟稔中美桐油貿易問題之某專家稱、自中日開戰以來、中國所產桐油、因交通運輸關係、輸美較往常困難、無庸諱言因此當戰事初發生時、美國</p>
<p>油價飛漲</p>
<p>影響所及、美國沿墨西哥灣各洲即弗羅利達路易齊亞那各洲之桐油業、乃設法加緊生產、按之本世紀初期、上述各州、即開始種植桐樹、試營提油工業閱數十寒暑而迄今日、此項油業、雖已進步甚多、但產量究屬有限、不足以供其國內大量之需要、故頻年仍</p>
<p>仰給中國</p>
<p>且年有增加、至一九三七年達最高峯、計是年由中國輸入美國之桐油、共達一七五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅、而美國國內所產，則以去年（一九三八）爲最多、然亦不過四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅、供需相差、固甚遠也、循是觀察、可知在此後數年中、美國之</p>
<p>桐油巿場</p>
<p>尚須向中國大量購進、可無疑問、至以美國人種植桐樹悄形而言、在最初時期、對於上壤質地、桐樹種類、以及氣候燥濕不知所宜、故損失甚大、年來盡力研究、巳大見進步、美國目前油價、完全視中國供應情形爲轉移、近兩年內、因戰事關係、油價</p>
<p>漲落殊巨</p>
<p>當一九三七年十一月問、日軍佔領上海後、桐油輸美、一時間斷、美油價即飛漲至每磅合美金二角二分之巨、旋因大批桐油改由香港輸出、油價隨之跌落、迄至去歲十月間、廣州淪陷、乃又回漲至每磅一角五分、自是厥後、油價卽徘徊於一角二分至一角五分之間、目今</p>
<p>中國桐油</p>
<p>復改循滇緬公路出口、政府對後方各省積極獎勵種植、並注意提煉、以提高品質、總之美國植桐、已日見進步、中國欲維持原有地位、亟應隨時注意改進也、</p>

<h3>所望於副刊投稿者的</h3>
<p>— 尙卿</p>
<p>副刊編者所負的資任的重大，我們已經知道了。但是一個副刊的成立，決不能單靠編者一個人，還須投稿者給他稿子，並且編者的主張，也往往要爲投稿者所左右，編者到底不能一意孤行，剛愎自用。光桿的編者，包辦一個副刊，或者至多的二三知己，自己敲鑼自己唱戲，原也有的，但是這是不正常的，並且也不是常見之事，當然不足爲訓。</p>
<p>於此，可見對於一個副刊，投稿者的重要，似乎還在編者之上，而我旣已有所希望於編者了，也就不能不有所希望於這些投稿者。</p>
<p>我希望他們會選擇要投的副刊，勿亂投。副刊是多的，彼此的內容和性質，當然也有相差無幾的，然而相差很遠，或和你的主張不合的，却也不少，你就不能不留心。如果因亂投而投錯了路，尤其投到落伍的，退化的，甚至反動的副刋上，雖然給你登出來，有優越的稿費，我想你一定也不見得開心吧！此外，如果你因稿費而投稿，只求其能够登出來，那末，我還希望你要謹愼你的署名，不要用同一的署名，使別人猜不透你究竟是一個怎樣的作家。</p>
<p>我希望他們勿跟在別人的背後跑。別人在討論甲事，你不要也去討論甲事；別人在描寫乙物，你不要也去描寫乙物。你的題材總要戞戞獨造，簇簇生新，切勿人云亦云，作些老生常談</p>
<p>我相信宇宙之大，人間事物之衆，可以作爲文章的題材，供我筆頭驅遣的，正也不知有多少，所謂取之不盡，用之不竭，正可以作這個解釋。只要你肯隨時隨地留心，養成敏銳的觀察力，我保證你，新顥的題材，可以俯拾即是。（不過又不可好奇太過，走入牛角尖裹去。）</p>
<p>我希望他們勿迎合編者的心理。投稿者迎合編者的心理，恐怕是最普遍的現象吧。有些投稿者，似乎並不去研究自身稿子的精進，却一味在研究編者的嗜好。這是不對的。方才我已經說過，投稿者是可以左右編者的主張的，只要你的稿子好，內容及外表都好，雖然你沒有恰恰迎合着編者的嗜好，我相信一個存心公正，而又事理明達的編者，決不會埋沒你的苦心的，那時，你反可以一鳴驚人。不過編者的主張確乎是對的，當然投稿者，也不能就此不問，還該用種種巧妙的文筆，予以發揚光大才是。</p>
<p>我希望他們會顧到環境。我說這話自然只適用於目前孤島上的投稿者，因爲孤島環境特殊了，投稿者就有顧到的必要，吾則不但勞而無功，並且要禍及報紙。然而我的所謂顧到，用意却並不如此消極，適得其反，我是說要積極的顧到。我們總不耍忘記目前的重任，抗戰建國，我們要盡我們文人的職責，在各種題目上，用各種的手法，寫出一致的文章，推動抗戰建國的運動。我深信文人之筆的確是無所不能的，特殊惡劣的環境的壓迫，決不能阻止特殊積極的文章的產生！</p>
<p>除了這些希望以外，當然我還希望每一個投稿者，勿寫無聊的文字，攻訐的文字，以及任何損人而不利己或者竟也損己的文字。這些我想正當的投稿者，一定是十分知道的，用不着我的辭費。</p>
<p>可是我以上的話，是對於一個已經成熟的投稿者說的，所謂已成熟者，就是他的思想，見解，以及寫作技術，都已經在水平綫以上的意思。如果對於一個未成熟的投稿者，換言之，就是思想，見解，或寫作技術，還有一項很幼稚的投稿者，我却另有我的希望。</p>
<p>我希望這樣的投稿者，馬上就會停止投稿！我當然知道他們的興趣，或者他們的自負。然而在這全國同胞救國不遑的時候，據我看，最好人人能够用得其長，直接致力於救國事業上。你在投稿上旣無把握，何必浪費精神與物力呢？你的興趣與自負，也儘可以留待到勝利之後，天下太平了，來慢慢地予以滿足。至於有些未成熟的投稿者，爲了稿子不登，或者怨天允人，怪編者的瞎眼，私心，或者輾轉請託，以求在報端漏一漏臉，我認爲尤其要不得，希望他們在馬上停止以外，還肯痛自懺悔！</p>
<p>我這樣的希望，也許一般的投稿者要覺得不滿意，說我有意對不起他們呢。我希望他們會鑒納我的誠心：我除了希望他們有正當的，卓越的發展以外，沒有別的用意。况且我自己也就是一個投稿者，我也正在將這些希望來勉勵着我自己！</p>
<h3>帶子鞋（下）</h3>
<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>—老奶奶的故事—</p>
<p>『慢着慢着，』老奶奶連忙按着他，『我還有話和你說呢：你覺得「他們」待人眞是好的麼？以前你不是說，你在「他們」地方也不見得好麼？』</p>
<p>『以前，』李金根就又坐了下來，『我的確不覺得「他們」好；自從我受了傷，「他們」給我醫治，我就覺得他們』好了。』</p>
<p>『你這個人眞是糊塗透頂了！我只問你：你這傷是怎樣會受到的？』</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>在這樣一問一答之後，老奶奶所說明的：要不是「他們」來，他就受不到傷，當然更用不着「他們」的醫治；「他們」一來，我們死的死，傷的傷，不死不傷的吃了多少苦；『他們不來，或者來了就去，永不再來，我們就有好日子過了。</p>
<p>『你的話很不錯，』李金根聽老奶奶說了一會，然後點着頭說，『爲什麼我早沒有想到，你倒會知道得這樣明白？』</p>
<p>這也難怪李金根要間，因爲老奶奶畢竟是一個鄉下老婦人，怎麼會如道這些呢！等到老奶奶將一切的事情都告訴了他之後，他才恍然大悟說：『哦，原來上决我上了你的當，將一切事情都告訴了你。』</p>
<p>『你說錯了，』老奶奶笑着說，『你並沒有上當；你作了你應該作的事情。上當的是「他們」不是你。』</p>
<p>『那末你現在還耍知道些什麼呢？』</p>
<p>『現在我並沒有一定要知道的事情，將來却很要知道一些應該知道的事情。』</p>
<p>她就一連串地指出了她應該知道的事情，也就是說，他，李金根，應該報告的事情。</p>
<p>『你一有消息，就來告訴阿森，讓阿森來告訴我們，因爲你是不能走遠的。』</p>
<p>『這個不危險麼？』他有些遲疑。</p>
<p>『危險是有的，』老奶奶又給他解釋，『但是幹得好，也就不會出危險。然而你要是怕危險不肯幹呢，那危險就注定會臨到你和你的一家了，你想想！』說到最後一句，口氣有些嚴厲。</p>
<p>『什麼？』</p>
<p>她告訴他，我們已經注意他，並且已經注意他的一家；也告訴他，假使誰都不肯出力，將來誰都要被「他們」宰割，消滅，……</p>
<p>『即使你在「他們」那裹遇到危險，我們也不會忘訊你。我們要……』老奶奶更加澈底地說。</p>
<p>『好，我一定聽你們的話！』李金根拍着胸脯，作了最後的肯定。</p>
<p>『那末明天我就可以回去了，』老奶奶歡然說，『你有什麼信要帶給你的家裹麼。』</p>
<p>『沒有什麼信，』李金根立起來說，『說我在這裹很好就是了。』又將手一伸說，『鞋子呢？給了我吧。』</p>
<p>『沒有帶來。』老奶奶忍着笑。</p>
<p>『什麼？』</p>
<p>『你的妻子還沒有做好呢，懂不懂？」老奶奶笑了出來。</p>
<p>『懂了懂了，』李金根也笑了。『那末我又上你的當了。』</p>
<p>李金根走出大門時，老奶奶却一把拉住了他，裝着詫異的神氣說：</p>
<p>『什麼？你就這樣走了麼？吃了我那些豆，錢呢？』</p>
<p>『錢沒有帶來，懂不懂？』李令根在一呆之後，也笑了出來。</p>
<p>錢阿森聽見了，也作着會心的微笑。</p>
<p>李金根拐着腿，在歡笑的氛圍中，離開了他們。</p>
<h3>惡作劇</h3>

<h3>如何精神自新—放手（六）</h3>
<p>— 湯</p>
<p>讀者恐怕已經很討厭了，怎的已往五天講什麼應當懺悔，什麼應當自新，難道我們人生中一些好的地方也沒餓的嗎？請不要誤會，當然我們十二分的承認人類本性中有很多很多可以讚揚的地方，同時我們亦不能否認人類還有許多應當建設的地方。在建設之前，一定有一番破壞的工作。在巨厦未建以前必先把舊屋子拆了，還得在好好的泥土中打了許多木頭和鋼鐵樁子。</p>
<p>我們現在已經反省過了，一定感到很抱歉，已往怎麼會有這許多的精神或道德的缺點。反省了怎麼辦？是否把這一切缺點送入「潛意識」，把它們忘了？心理學家吿訴我們這樣做是十分不健全的，會引起各種心理病態的。最好的方法是用大無畏的精神來對付它們。這種耶穌的敎訓恰巧相合。我們不但在上帝面前應懺悔，還要到種關係方面云認清楚。經過這一切你才得眞把它們放手，就會得到新生命。</p>

<h3>譯完了「愛國者」以後</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>我很早就作了賽珍珠女士著作的讀者。我常常驚異於一個外國的作家，能把我們中國的人情風俗，觀察得那樣仔細，描寫得那麼逼眞。縱然在她的作品中間，儘還有着過於誇張甚至難免錯誤的地方，然而我以爲對於一個異邦的作家，似乎不應該苛求得那樣厲害。允其自從她獲得了諾貝爾文學獎金以後，我更慶幸她的成功。賽珍珠女士的獲得諾貝爾獎金，雖然頗有人訾議，雖然也頗有人驚奇，但是我相信，獎金的授予，決不是兒戲的事，那是一定有她應得獎金的業續，和她應得獎金的理由，不容我們置疑的。現在我更高興我已作了賽珍珠女士新著「愛國者」的譯者了。</p>
<p>我譯「愛國者」的動機，是異常單純的。有一决，我在某一家西書鋪裹發現了一本賽珍珠女士的新著「愛國者」，的略看了一下那篇附印在包書紙上的說明，知道是描寫這一時代中國動向的作品，於是不問好歹，立刻買了回來。費了幾個晚問，我把「愛國者」通篇看了一遍，覺得寫的很動人；然而我當時並無把它譯成中文的意思：一則因爲我正在繙譯法國馬爾勞的「人的希望」，決無冉譯他書的餘暇；再則因爲我知道那樣一部好書，一定會有人着手繙譯，似乎不必再湊什麼熱鬧。然而我畢竟又大湊熱鬧從事繙譯者，那完全是幾位朋友鼓勵慫恿之功。有一個晚上，我和巴金先生在某處晚餐，就談起賽珍珠女士這部新著的事，我只表示這種名作，應該介紹給中國讀者；而他便接着說，道種繙譯介紹的工作就應該由我去担任啊。後來又另外幾位朋友談起，他們都鼓勵我即刻着手繙譯道一部新著。於是我竟「開工」了　二十多萬字的一個長篇，居然在我斗窒中開始給我譯成中文了。一經着手，成績頗使我駭然，利用每天的餘暇，倒也譯成不少。接着便有好幾家書店向我接洽，願意接受出版；這些書店中間，我就選定了萬葉，朋友唐齊馮煃兩先生，他們本也有意繙譯該書，看見我忙，就來幫我合譯。感謝他們；有了他們的合作，這個譯本才會在今天呈獻於讀者之前。</p>
<p>「愛國者」的題村，異常新穎；不僅描寫北伐以後的情形，抑且描寫到抗戰以後的動態；不僅描寫艱苦奮鬥的中國，抑且描寫到存心叵測的日本。「愛國者」的故事，也異常複雜；不僅描寫如火如荼的革命，抑且描寫到纏綿悱惻的戀愛；不僅描寫中國家庭中的糾紛，抑且描寫到日本軍隊中的風紀。而「愛國者」的人物，允其包羅得袤廣；有殷富的巨賈，有赤貧的工農；有失意的將軍，有革命的公子；有英勇的鬥士，有無恥的漢奸；有卓識的丫鬟，有無聊的文士；有日本的商賈，有德國的夫人；有白俄的司機，有美國的駕駛員……而最使我們驚服不止的是，蔣委員長也是本書人物之一；他的言行舉止，都被直接描寫在故事中；把委員長寫作小說中的人物，我想這恐怕還是第一决吧。</p>
<p>原著的好壞，我想還是留待讀者去批評。不過在譯筆方面，我是向來主張儘量依從原著，然而又須儘量使中國的讀者（注意，我們讀者都是中國人！）看得明白的。無論原著如何偉大，如果譯成了連中國讀者都看不懂的中文，我相信原著的偉大，還是顯不出來；反之，那是多麼侮辱原著的作者！然而限於個人的學識，難免有不妥的地方；而且一經排印的手續，又決乎難免魯魚的錯誤，那是應得向原著者以及讀者致歉的地方。</p>
<p>感謝豐子愷先生，因爲他答應爲我們的譯本作畫。也感謝讀者，假如能够指正和批評。（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3>空軍戰士符保盧</h3>
<p>— 紊霞</p>
<p>抗戰前他就在虹橋飛機場工作　全運會時曾主演過電影「海葬」</p>
<p>抗戰的大旗，在中國五千年的泥土上，發着異樣光輝的時候，各省各地的熱血靑年，都背上了槍桿，冒着砲火，開拔到前錢去了。</p>
<p>抗戰的歌聲，響徹了每一個冷落的鄉村，銹爛的槍桿與刺刀都被擦得雪亮冒着火光。</p>
<p>這時候，各層階級的人，男的和女的，都投身軍戎，尤其是智識分子，他們都丟開了課本，投奔到軍隊裏去。</p>
<p>體育界則有許多著名的選手如「小黑炭」陳鎮和，撑竿跳大王符保盧，全運撑高跳第二名王禾等，都加入了中國的空軍，為國效勞。</p>
<p>這些著名運動選手的加入空軍，不單顯示了中國國民的優秀份子參加抗戰，同時更說明，他們不僅僅是「運動明星」，而且也是參加全國抗戰最能戰鬥的一員。</p>
<p>昨日本報載符保盧在桂林參加空戰列難的惡耗，這不幸的消意，我們希望只是一個謠傳，現在讓我告訴讀者一點關於這位空軍戰士平日的生活。</p>
<p>符保盧：生成一頭棕色的鬈髪，瘦削的但顯得精神很飽滿的嘴臉，嘴上留着一點小鬍髭，個子並不很高，但很結實</p>
<p>他的個性很暴燥，但却異常爽直。</p>
<p>他從小就生長在哈爾濱，父親是東北人，母親是俄國人，他家庭裹還有一個弟弟，和兩個妹妹，現在他們全家都在上海，在霞飛路開着一家參行</p>
<p>符保盧也因爲這個關係，不單說得一口純熟的俄國話，同時也能說一口流利的英文。</p>
<p>如若你不知道符保盧身世的，你會在他身上，發見一種異國的風味，也許你會猜想他不是中國人，但是，在朋友中間，或是在馬路上，有人假加冒冒失失地說他是俄國人，他一聽見馬上會生氣，甚至不惜動手打你，至少得和你說個明白他是中國的哈爾濱人。</p>
<p>符保盧很喜歡喝酒，喝酒以後，性子有時很粗魯，但是，他心地很良善。在戰事以前，他在虹橋飛機塲任事，有一决他酒暍得半醉，開着汽車，帶着金燄等許多朋友，用了五六十碼的速度開到虹橋飛機塲去，半路上險和另一部卡車相撞，嚇得全車的人幾乎呌起來。</p>
<p>他曾經娶過一個很漂亮的俄國老婆，後來兩個人分開了，他常常一喝醉酒，就想他這位外國太太，神經質的流着眼淚，等他醒過來，朋友們便羞着他。</p>
<p>在全國運動會的時候，那時王禾想和符保盧爭一個撑高跳的首席，那天晚上，王禾翻來覆去的睡不着覺，（他曾經回上海一次，現在又回到空軍去了。）但符保盧到第二天，還是爭到個首位，實際上，符保盧到並不怎麼苦練。有人說，符保盧假如能够冉下點苦功，那麼世界運勁會中，不致「榜上無名」的。</p>
<p>符保盧也曾嘗過電影滋味，那時王斌在天一公司，自已寫了一個劇本呌「海葬」的，決定請符來主演，另外還有劉莉影諸人合演這張影片。</p>
<p>那時符保盧確忙得可以，白天上全運會，晚上拍「海葬」，後來這張影片在全運會還沒有結束以前，曾在新光大戲院上映。</p>
<p>中國軍隊西撤以後，他化離開了上海。想不到竟傳來這樣意外的惡耗，我們只有祝福着：這位空軍戰士依然無恙吧</p>
<h3>鴿病及其治法</h3>
<p>— 張文德</p>
<p>鴿痘</p>
<p>（傳染病）初起發生粒粒小塊，漸漸腫起似疣狀，急將患處從根割去，搽以石灰酸水，另塗上軟膏即可。</p>
<p>瘦病</p>
<p>（傳染病）此病只見鴿子忽而消瘦而已，過三四日後，完全不能飛動，見狀後速宜將病鴿隔離業鴿，可將蒜頭搗汁使飮之。</p>
<p>口渴病</p>
<p>飮汚濁飮料及不良食物，可使飮極濃之辣椒水。</p>
<p>翼傷</p>
<p>兩鴿相爭，翼翅受傷，可用碘酒搽之可分二種：長形虱及圓形虱。前者匿於翅翼上，後者寄生於鴿之頸上。可用殺蟲粉撒上段之，二天一次，不可間斷。如鴿舍巢內，亦有虱跡，可用火油殺之，另鋪白石灰一層。</p>
<p>虎烈拉</p>
<p>如某鴿一旦染此病，在短時內亦有全羣覆沒之危險。拿鴿頭向下，鴿體向上，用兩手輕壓嗉囊，水就從口中流出，急使與牠鴿隔離，以魚肝油和以木油，混合成劑，從口中灌入，他鴿之飮水可加石灰酸，及龍胆酊。</p>
<p>幼鴿孵化</p>
<p>雌雄配合旣成，產卵期將屆，雌雄鴿協力銜啄稻草及羽毛片等，最好飼鴿者，加以烟草之梗及莖，可預防寄生蟲，產卵之前，雌者精神萎靡，羽毛下垂，似呈有病痛之態，蟄居巢房，如此三日後，即產下第一卵，雌雄鴿即輪流從事抱卵，相隔一日又產第二卵，此後晨間至午後三時爲雄鴿抱卵，三時至晚間爲雌鴿抱卵，經十七日之孵化，雛鴿即從卵中咬破而出，一星期後羽毛生全，過一月即能出巢覓物，飛翔矣。</p>
<p>信鴿訓練</p>
<p>欲使鴿成爲傳信及通消息者，必須加以訓練。最先使鴿熟認鴿舍，並於飼食時用以信號，似口吹，口笛，呼鴿入室，並飼以美食及淸水，養成認識鴿舍之習慣。翌晨使全羣鴿試飛十分鐘，朝夕各一次，日後漸增加，然後分幼鴿，一年鴿，二年鴿，三年鴿，及四年以上之經騐老鴿，分別訓練俟飛翔法純熱後，然後带到鴿舍附近之地，一一放回，然後日漸使鴿舍與放鴿距離逐漸延長，惡劣鴿亦可逐漸淘汰。放鴿法可分：各個放，逐决放，一齊放。各個放，一只一只放去、不見所放之鴿後、然後放第二鴿；逐决放，先放之鴿還在視綫中，便放第一鴿；一齊放，使合籠鴿子一齊起飛。八〇一三前，南市文廟動物園亦有信鴿會組織，每月携各會員之信鴿至蘇州，無錫，南京等處競賽，優良者冠軍，並可得政府要人之錦標及獎狀。</p>
<p>放鴿</p>
<p>天氣惡劣似雨，雪，暴風，重霧，使飛翔方向受重大之打擊；飮水不問飛程長短，宜充分給之。（完）</p>
<h3>記關良</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>——關氏畫展序曲——</p>
<p>提起關良，我的腦海中便泛起一個印象，他是一個寡言沉着的一個純藝術家風格的印象。</p>
<p>的確，關良在中國新藝術的園地中，也是一個開墾的園丁。他是一個前輩的洋畫家，很早就在日本研習繪事，回國以後，便在上海，武昌，廣州諸地的美術學校裹先後担任敎授。他的繪畫，早先就主張中國風的融洽。因爲僅僅模倣一點西洋的技巧，應用一點西洋的材料，甚而至採取西洋畫中慣用的題村，雖則能够把握了造形美術的繪靈的空間感，然而畢竟不是自己的東西。</p>
<p>所以關氏的畫面上，有着瀟洒脫俗的風格，同時充盈着近於文人畫的趣味，那微妙的調子，雅淡的色彩，那洒脫不覊的用筆，往往採用東方的題材，疏疏落落地毫不費力的表現出來。這一種表現，是融洽了石濤，八大山人的技法。這一種純中國的藝術的風格，在不是保守枯死的學院派的畫法，就是模倣某一些繪畫的作風或某山人的筆法的中國畫壇之中，的確是新鮮不過的。</p>
<p>如果我們細細觀察關氏作風的演變，他早期的作品，常然受着塞尚（Cezanne）的影響很大，這是現代任何作家都有的共通現象，所以他的表現是非常堅實而沉着，絕無空虛而浮泛，其對象的質感景感以及空間感的表出，當然是必能把握了。同時以描寫艷麗嫵媚的肉體著稱的雷諾亞（Renoir），給他的影響也是不少。</p>
<p>他在最近幾年當中，並不以此自滿而停滯於狹窄的範圍裹，他還是常常致力製作，不絕地爲了他藝術的進步而找尋影響。因之關氏的盡，在面積上並不怎麼大，色彩是偏於沉靜恬澹的，題材只是些風景，人體，靜物，構圖又不宏偉，筆觸更不潑刺，可是他能够把平凡簡單的對象，表現出一種輕快的旋律，把捉住蘊藏於自然內的情緒，從低矮的屋子，小樹，斜的電桿木，花卉，果實，少女的臉……表現出一種潛在而豐富的詩意。這種詩意，不是文學上的，又不是哲學或社會科學等題材要求關係上所引起一種詩意。</p>
<p>註：關氏畫展定本月八日至十一日在大新公司叫樓舉行</p>
<h3>小老婆打招呼</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨見報載，在精衛派陳某赴北平僞組織王克敏處疏通。叉前日報載，北平僞組織王克敏，暨南京僞組織梁鴻志，反對在氏某種運動云云。然則在精衛遣派其心腹爪牙，四處打招呼也固宜。</p>
<p>凡做人家小老婆的，必須先打招呼，做第一位小老婆，必須向大老婆打招呼；做第二小老婆，必須向第一小老婆打招呼；做第三第四小老婆，必須向第一第二小老婆打招呼。因爲先進廟門三日大，吾則不是給你一個閉門羹，便是打你一頓下馬威。不吃醋不成爲小老婆，小老婆的吃醋，原是小老婆的本色也。</p>
<p>汪氏係出名門，現在年華老大，而反作他人之妾，向一般妖精妖怪去打招呼，汪氏引鏡自照，何以爲情，回首當年，不知若何感想矣。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十一回　認鄕親杵臼舊生涯　附權勢簪纓新貴族</p>
<p>這兩個條件，她父親容佩英一夜天的考量，明晨就要決定。可憐潘佩英哭了一夜，百計籌思不能不服從第一個條件。因爲不如此，趙樂天的性命要不　。父親是說得到，要做得到的，眞個通知憲兵隊，派幾個憲兵抓他去槍斃了，人家只以爲失踪了，還不知道咧。况且我們與他，勢不兩立，是顯然的事。他能娶一個　　的女兒爲妻嗎？即使他願意，人家也不答應他咧。我們家裏，也決不能容許一個游擊隊做女婿呢。這僞政府中，也不是一人，而且互相傾軋。至少也要說你與游擊隊相通，這個罪名，吃得消嗎？不過佩英想：這封回信，寫得緩和一點。他來書，敎我勸我的父親，我把父親的勸不轉，可以詳細告訴他。他來書，要我脫離家庭，我把我現在不能晚離情形，也可以告訴他。但是我這封信，勢必經父親檢查後，然後可以發出，決不能嚕哩嚕囌，寫上許多；也不能將一切苦衷，告訴了他。只好現在暫且簡捷的照父親意旨，答復了他，過後再想辦法。第一是要救他性命要緊，不要白白地犧牲了，爲了我死戀着他，結果反而害了他，這是要使人追悔的事。因此她這封信，寫得並無　棉之意，却有決絕之心。簡直說：我們現在與你旨趣不同，你不必再寫信來，多所饒舌。即使冉有信來，也槪不答復了。佩英的意思，還以爲趙樂天倘然是聰明人，一定維測得出我是失去自由的人。因爲這些話，一看便知道不是我平日所說的。那末他看了這封信，還有不明白的嗎？將來我有了機會，可以再寫信給她。說明上一次所寫的信，不是出於自己本意，乃是由於强迫而寫的。而且還可以告訴他，在當時是危機一髪，他們已經知道你的地址，可以而憲兵來抓你，不能不寫這封信的理由。佩英因此故意的把這封信，寫得極爲冷淡，絕非從前與趙樂天通信的一般口吻。這信自然要經她父親檢查過後，方能寄出。父親見她寫得很冷淡而決絕，甚爲滿意。說她自己覺悟，不與這班少年，五相往來，保不吃虧。但也暗中防備，怕她再與趙樂天通信，把他們的通信綫封鎖起來。（一三〇）</p>

<h3>關於驚人的劇訉</h3>
<p>— 梯公</p>
<p>自從本欄刊載梅花館主的驚人劇訉後，我相信整　孤島的人士，一定大大騷動，先就敝處一百餘同人而論，囚我與戲劇界比較接近，已紛紛託我探聽真假，預備硬送壽禮。以前張善琨氏的封翁堂戲，余先生曾在愚人節撒下一個漫天大謊，害得千萬戲迷白歡喜一陣，可是館主平索不愛開玩笑，何況昨天六月六日是個教師節，也好算洋狗惚浴節，似乎沒有準許說謊的規定，所以我忍不住打了個電話給館主，結果他很嚴肅地回答我並非洋爛污，擔保支票兌現，給他這麼肯定地一擔保，我對於這張驚人鉅數的支票，倒的確有點垂涎欲滴了。</p>
<p>不過我依舊有點懷疑，據我的觀察，第一，叔岩我可以決定他不來，最簡單的理由是他來了，將對不起以前請他被拒絕過的幾位海上聞人，第二，蘭芳也決不會來，因為他一來，就很難擺脫『重為馮婦」，第三，據熟悉馮氏家世的告訴我，馮三小姐的閨名，並不叫碧頎，這碧頎却是馮六爺姬人的小字，凡跟六爺相諗的，因此都管着呌碧珊，因這幾點，我想請海上周郞先不要與翁過早，寗可信其無，不可信其有，萬一屆期果然實現，豈不可以喜出望外嗎。</p>
<p>不管怎樣，單拿這一張戲單諷詠三四遍，已經望梅止渴，足當過屠門而嚼了。</p>
<p>（寄按）梯公的話，確是不錯，昨天外界電話來問真相的，真是應接不暇，足見海上顧曲界與奮之至。據我所知，這堂會正在積極籌備中，排戲的那位總提調，是海上聞名的老票友，他本想暫緩發表的，不料為我們儘先披露，莫怪大家有此詫異。至於三天戲目和演員，我敢說不會差到那裏去的。以後發展的情形，本刊仍當據實報道，請讀者注意。</p>
<h3>影城女星的新運動</h3>
<p>— 鳳翔</p>
<p>擴胸壯臀—風行一時</p>
<p>—別開生面的健美法</p>
<p>好萊塢美容專家吉姆，台維斯氏（Jim　Davise），最近發明了擴胸壯臀的運動，這二項運動，目前在好萊塢女明星中，風行一時，如桃樂賽萊瑪（Donothy　Lemour）和喬納，蕙兒杜（Janet　Waldo）,便是其中進行得最起勁的份子。</p>
<p>依照台維斯氏的秘訣，發達胸部的動作，十分簡單。練習時任你坐着也好，立着也好，衹要舉臂曲肘，放手腕在離胸前一呎的地位，用兩手的手指互相輕輕的抵觸時，使會覺得胸肌在擴展。如此做去，每日一分鐘四十次地施行二分鐘，根據台維斯的實驗，若連續不斷地照做，經過兩個月後，你的胸部便能獲得發達，因胸肌的發達，可以支持乳峯的高聳了。</p>
<p>至於壯臀的妙法，台維斯氏也有要訣，指導如後：在天花板上懸下一根繩，使繩端離地十八時，如果你以為這樣太費事，那麼可以用靠背椅來代替的。預備姿勢，第一步先仰面睡倒，用兩手握住繩子或椅的靠背，使頭和頸抬起，同時把腳也相並擺舉起，務使頭足離地約六時許，重心集中於臀部為止，這樣準備完畢，便可開始動作；先盡力以足轉向左面，然後再轉向左面，往復運動，第一天做十次，第二天做十二次，餘則類推，直到你能轉動到五十次一天，才不再增加次數，三個月後，壯臀自能得到一個圓滿的效果。</p>

<h3>Intercepted by the Chinese Army, the Japanese Army in Qianjiang is Unable to Continue its Westward Advance. A Portion of the Chinese Army Crosses the Han River to Harass the Japanese Rear, the Yellow River Breach Widens, and the Japanese Army on the Longhai Railway is Struck.</h3>
<p>Fancheng: After the Japanese army in central Hubei suffered setbacks in its invasion of Suizao, it split up and fled towards Tianmen, Yuekou, Yingcheng, Zaoshi, and Anlu and Yingshan in the lower reaches of the Xiang River. In the Yuekou and Qianjiang areas, they were intercepted by the Chinese army and were unable to continue their offensive. Separately, over ten thousand Japanese troops have recently assembled in Xinyang, seemingly with further intentions. A certain unit of the Chinese army is closely monitoring them, and the Japanese army will definitely not succeed. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the Chinese military spokesperson, the Japanese army that crossed the Han River numbered only one thousand. The reason for their success in crossing the river was solely due to the use of poison gas. However, these one thousand Japanese troops have suffered a major blow from the Chinese side and have retreated. It is expected that the Japanese army will not attempt to cross the river again in this manner, as the number of people who crossed was small enough for us to eliminate. If they attempt a large-scale offensive, then the maintenance of their rear lines of communication must be fully undertaken by a sufficient number of troops, but given the current strength of the Japanese army in China, this is simply not possible. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese army that crossed the Han River and occupied Qianjiang consisted of artillery and infantry units. They have not made any further attempts to advance westward. According to Chinese sources, after the arrival of Chinese reinforcements, they are now counterattacking Qianjiang. Fighting in western Shanxi is reported to have occurred north of Liulin, with the Japanese army advancing north in two routes from Lishi and Zhongyang, aiming to spy on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. (June 6th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the Chinese military spokesperson, the Yellow River has always been a disaster for China, but at present, it has become China's only barrier against Japanese aggression. In June of last year, the Japanese army advanced and stationed troops in Kaifeng, attempting to attack Zhengzhou and strike the rear of Wuhan along the Pinghan railway. Thanks to the breach of the Yellow River at this time, which was 400 meters wide and flooded thousands of acres of land, the Japanese army's plan to attack Wuhan from this direction was completely thwarted. Although they later took the Yangtze River to attack Wuhan, it extended the Japanese offensive by five months. Currently, the Yellow River breach has expanded from 400 meters to 1,000 meters. The water volume can reach up to 15,000 cubic feet at its peak and currently reaches 12,000 cubic feet, making it impossible for the Japanese army to advance west along the Longhai Railway from this direction. According to reports, after Chinese guerrillas attacked Kaifeng in May, the Tsuchihashi Division stationed in Shanxi Province was transferred to Kaifeng. We suspected that they intended to attack Zhengzhou from this direction, but after Xuzhou was attacked by our guerrillas, the Tsuchihashi Division in Kaifeng was immediately transferred back to the rear of Xuzhou. It can be seen that the new Yellow River has again become an obstacle to the Japanese army's advance, and the Japanese army has also fundamentally abandoned its plan to attack Zhengzhou from this direction. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, the Japanese army in Qianjiang is unable to advance due to the extraordinary activity of the Chinese army. A unit of the Chinese army has crossed the eastern bank of the Han River, disrupting the rear of the Japanese army, threatening the withdrawal of the Japanese army west of the Han River. At the same time, the Chinese army is actively counterattacking Qianjiang. It is expected that the final fate of the town will be decided within days. (June 6th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Offensive in Western Shanxi Has Been Repelled, and Fierce Fighting is Underway in Zhongyang. The Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Retreats to Xia County.</h3>
<p>Xingji: This time, the Japanese army mobilized new and elite forces for a large-scale westward offensive. Their Henan Division Commander was stationed in Fenyang, and the Yamaguchi Brigade Commander also arrived in Lishi to command. The Japanese army on the front line of Liulin suffered heavy losses from the Chinese army and dared not advance further. Therefore, the Japanese army adopted a policy of outflanking and encircling, launching multiple routes from Zhongli to the north and south, attempting to seize the Jikou, Jundu, and Sanjiao crossing points, and then cross the river to invade Shaanxi. After days of fierce fighting by the Chinese army, their momentum has been thwarted. The Japanese army, with a large force advancing westward along the Lishi-Qikou road, was severely attacked by a certain brigade of the Chinese army near Wang Laopo Mountain, and ambushed on both sides of the road by two regiments. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with 500 to 600 killed or wounded, and fled southeast. The Chinese army is clearing the remaining Japanese troops on Wang Laopo Mountain and continuing to advance southeast in pursuit. A portion of the Japanese army, numbering over 2,000, which advanced westward from Zhongyang, occupied Liudu (west of Zhongyang) on the 2nd, and then split into two groups to attack Liulin to the north. One group of 3,000 men, passing through Shibengtou, Fengjiazhuang, and Fengjia'an (southeast of Liudu), is currently engaged in fierce fighting with a certain division of the Chinese army. Furthermore, a certain division of the Chinese army is currently operating between Sanjiao and Da Wushan, taking advantage of the situation to occupy Qiaojia Mountain and other strongholds near Da Wu. Also, the Chinese army unit is actively operating in the mountains northeast of Lishi, causing great panic among the Japanese army in Lishi. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: Starting from the 6th, the Japanese army in southern Shanxi launched an offensive against the Chinese army from three routes: Zhangdian, Yuncheng, and Huling. The various units of the Chinese army have advanced separately to meet the enemy. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: Several thousand Japanese troops, who arrived at Shuitouzhen (north of Anyi) from Beixian on the 3rd, scurried towards Yangcun, Dingcun, and the east of Anyi on the afternoon of the 4th, where they encountered a certain Deng unit of the Chinese army. After a day of intense fighting, the Japanese army, under the pressure of heavy Chinese artillery fire, suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Xia County. Also, on the morning of the 3rd, 2,000 Japanese troops from Anyi scurried through Zhujiazhuang to Shuangmiao and Hanwang. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the recent developments in the war situation in western Shanxi are extremely important. After 10,000 Japanese troops crossed the eastern bank of the Yellow River 170 kilometers southwest of Taiyuan, they divided their forces into three routes and attacked Jundu. The first route, the main force of the Japanese army in Shanxi Province, attacked Liulin along the highway from Lishi. The second route advanced from Lishi to Qikou. The third route advanced northwest from Zhongyang. It is said that the fighting in the area has rapidly evolved into a major battle, and the Chinese army has been prepared for it and has been waiting for it for a long time. It is widely believed that a fierce and bloody battle will soon break out in the border area between Shanxi and Shaanxi. (June 6th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese army attacking Liulin on the front lines, numbering about 500, is at Liangjiahui and Kongjiashan (over 20 li east of Liulin), with four cannons attached. The Japanese troops in Xingjiawan and Jiaokou have all increased and are attacking the Chinese side. The Japanese army on the right flank, numbering 400 to 500, is in the Xuejialing and Angou area, 30 li south of Chugou. The Japanese army on the left flank, numbering over 1,500, is迂迥 from Hanjialing (north of Liulin) to the south, attempting to encircle Liulin. The Chinese army is 분路迎系 in progress. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese military spokesperson said that the fighting along the Yellow River in Shanxi and Shaanxi is currently very fierce. It is said that the purpose of the Japanese army is to cross the Yellow River, but the number of new Japanese soldiers arriving in Shanxi Province is only 10,000. After these 10,000 soldiers arrive in Shanxi Province, they are only sufficient to make up for the losses, so there has been no increase in strength in reality. Moreover, since the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese army in Shanxi Province has repeatedly attempted to cross the river, but each attempt has failed. It is expected that this attempt to cross the river will still end in failure. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army that Scurried into Sanjiang Has Been Completely Eliminated, and the Head of the Puppet Army Has Been Executed.</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the Jiangmen puppet army's disastrous defeats in its invasion of Sanjiang, Xinhui, and Muzhou, there have been no further offenses in the past two days. The Japanese warships near Sanjiang have also completely withdrawn. The captured puppet advance team leader Zhao Xuan and over 100 team members have been handed over to the Fifth Guerrilla Area Headquarters. (June 6th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The number of Japanese troops in Qingjiujiang has increased to over 3,000. The Japanese army in Shakou fired artillery shells on the 5th, heavily bombarding the area near Tangxia. The Chinese army suffered no damage. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The remaining Japanese troops that scurried into Luzhou and Sanjiang have been completely eliminated. The puppet advance team leader Zhao Shanzhan and Chief of Staff Li Xinyong, who were captured by the Chinese army in this battle, have all been executed, to the great satisfaction of the people. The situation in Jiangxin is currently stable. The main force of the Japanese army in Xinhui is still gathered in the area west of the Xinhui city gate, confronting the Chinese army. (June 6th dispatch)</p>
<p>The Course of Street Fighting in Guangzhou City</p>
<p>Yingde: According to military news, a certain unit of the Chinese army suddenly charged into the urban area of Guangzhou on the night of the 24th of last month and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese military police headquarters in the northern district of the city. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army on Shuangjing Street, killing many Japanese soldiers. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army charged into Xihua Road and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese puppets, killing Zeng Ming, the deputy leader of the intelligence group of the puppet maintenance association, and many Japanese soldiers on the spot. Several hours later, a large number of Japanese troops stationed on Guanyin Mountain came to reinforce, and Japanese aircraft also strafed at low altitude. The Chinese army fought fiercely with the Japanese army until dawn, bravely broke through, and transferred to a certain place. In this battle, 70 to 80 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese army suffered the death of platoon leader Wu Hai and the injury of one soldier. (June 6th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Concessions and War</h3>
<p>"Japan's real enemy is not China, but the concessions within China's borders." This is the view of the Japanese newspaper "Miyako Shimbun," as reported by Reuters from Tokyo yesterday. Such remarks can be intuitively judged as emotional outbursts. Since they are based on emotion, they are unlikely to be grounded in reason and can be left aside. However, throughout history, both ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, human events are often driven by emotion and rarely governed by reason. Therefore, in the realm of reason, it is important to skillfully manage one's own emotions and not to disregard the emotions of others. Moreover, Japan's actions towards China are undoubtedly driven by emotion to a great extent. At least, the events such as initiating the conflict at the Lugou Bridge and hastily deploying heavy troops to the Shanhai Pass, and initiating the conflict at the Hongqiao Airport and hastily deploying naval forces to threaten the Wusongkou, made the Sino-Japanese issue unmanageable and led to war, and today is the beginning of the twenty-fourth month. Surely, this is not a rational action, but driven by emotion. Speaking in this way, how dare we belittle the Miyako Shimbun!</p>
<p>Regarding concessions in China, it is not difficult to explain their origins from a historical perspective, their boundaries from a geographical perspective, their nature from a legal perspective, and their system from an administrative perspective. However, discussing their relations, inferring their influence, and analyzing their good, evil, fortune, misfortune, benefits, losses, gains, and losses is extremely complex and subtle. Not only do various contradictions coexist, but they also evolve and change in many contradictory directions. It is not easy to make a concise outline or an accurate concept. Therefore, throughout history, Chinese and foreigners have held various opinions on concessions: some yearn for them, some abhor them; some cherish them, some discard them like worn-out shoes; some believe that they have limitless future, some suspect that they will be destroyed in an instant; some regard them as paradise, the source of all benefits; some regard them as hell, the hiding place of all evils. Because of their multifaceted nature, they have been subject to widely disparate evaluations. This was the case in normal times, but when China and Japan went to war, the contradictions inherent in the nature of the concessions became even more exposed. After the Japanese launched a military invasion of China, they encountered unexpected frustrations in military, economic, and diplomatic aspects. Let alone that they could not resolve this frustration, they could not even answer the causes of this frustration. Instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed heaven and earth, and eventually transferred their anger to the concessions. Thus, they seemed to have found something and said that the enemy was here.</p>
<p>How can the concessions be Japan's enemy? China's material resistance is based on its vast interior, with fields, hills, forests, and minerals. The concessions are as small as bullets, and not worth mentioning. The spirit of China's resistance lies in its resilience, perseverance, and the ability of the military and civilians living in the interior to reproduce. The quality and quantity of those living in the concessions are only one-hundredth of those in the interior. The import of China's weapons has only been possible through the northwest and southwest since the fall of Guangdong, so how can it still rely on the concessions for import and export? China's victory lies in its long history and vast space. The factors for victory and defeat for both sides have nothing to do with the concessions. To put it another way, if today's concessions are controlled by the Chinese, how can they benefit the resistance? If the concessions are controlled by the Japanese, how can they harm the future of China's resistance, or how can they benefit Japan's war effort? Moreover, concessions and war are not only unrelated, but also closely related. The relationship is this: if Japan wins, it will definitely regard the concessions as forbidden fruit; if China wins, the concessions will be unprecedentedly prosperous with the great cause of China's revival. Therefore, to say that the fate of the war depends on the concessions is not reasonable. The fate of the concessions really depends on the final outcome of the war. This is because the concessions are in China and are destined by nature. This kind of close relationship, this kind of inevitable cause and effect, is well known throughout the world. If driven by emotion and attempting to change the fate of the concessions before the war situation determines victory or defeat, it is like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, and is no different from suicide. Why? Preserving the concessions depends on cooperation from all parties, while destroying the concessions can be done by any party. Therefore, we not only advise the Chinese in the concessions to respect themselves, but also want to tell the Japanese not to mistakenly regard the concessions as enemies!</p>
<p>Emotional remarks are irrelevant to reason and useless to reality. However, inciting emotion and leading many people to emotion, even forming emotional actions, is not only irrelevant and useless, but also leads to straying from the right path and inviting one's own troubles. Therefore, if the Chinese side cannot understand that the insignificant concessions have no bearing on the war situation, and cannot respect themselves within the concessions, leading to the destruction of the concessions, then international sympathy for China will undergo an adverse transformation. If the Japanese side regards the concessions as enemies, then the concessions are an international bomb. If Japan detonates it, the Pacific Ocean will boil!</p>
<h3>Japan Demands Extradition of Terrorists, British Consul-General in Tianjin Agrees to Transfer. Instructed by the British Government to Hand Over Some, but Those with No Evidence of Crime are Expelled from the Concession</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here today, the British Consul-General rejected the Japanese demand on May 31st for the British Concession authorities to hand over the assassin of Cheng Xigeng, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, as well as other anti-Japanese terrorists, in the Ameton letter. The British Consul-General's reason was that there was no evidence that the Chinese currently in custody were the main criminals in the assassination of Cheng. After receiving this reply, Japanese officials discussed how to implement the "free action" method outlined in the Ameton letter. According to reports, the Ameton letter demanding the extradition of the murderer was submitted by Tanaka, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, to the British Consul-General in Tianjin on May 31st, and demanded a reply from the British side by no later than July 7th. At the same time, the British Consulate was unwilling to criticize the Japanese note, but said that although the note had a deadline for reply, it could not be regarded as a formal Ameton letter.

<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here, the British Consul-General in Tianjin visited the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin at 3:00 PM today under the orders of his government, indicating that he would hand over the terrorists referred to by the Japanese side.

<p>(London) Reuters learned from official sources that the British government has instructed Jameson, the British Consul-General in Tianjin, to hand over two Chinese caught with bombs to the Japanese authorities. Suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the former Tianjin Customs Superintendent, will be expelled from the concession if there is no substantial evidence of their crimes. Therefore, criminals who commit serious crimes in the future will be handed over to the de facto authorities, and those who commit minor crimes will be expelled from the concession.

<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, visited the British Foreign Office again this afternoon to protest the British Concession in Tianjin handing over so-called terrorists to the Japanese.

<h3>The Chongqing Newspaper Urgently Hopes for British-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning's editorial in the Chongqing United Daily News, entitled "British-Soviet Cooperation and World Peace," urgently hopes that British and Soviet politicians will abandon unimportant disputes, and believes that British-Soviet cooperation will definitely be realized. There are three reasons: 1. The two governments have the same basic policy on peace; 2. No matter whether Germany's future actions are in the East or in Western Europe, both Britain and the Soviet Union will be affected; 3. If the Soviet Union does not participate, the effectiveness of any peace front will be reduced. Therefore, it is ultimately believed that British-Soviet cooperation will become a reality.

<h3>Economic Assistance to China: Britain Fails to be Thorough, Loan of £3.5 Million, Only £280,000 Used</h3>
<p>(London) According to news here today, Britain's recent economic assistance seems to be quite stingy. The total amount of the loan granted by Britain to China was originally £3.5 million, but as of now, China has only spent £288,000 due to the purchase of 300 trucks. As for the US Export-Import Bank's loan of US$25 million to China, most of it has already been used. The reason why China has not been able to fully utilize the British loan is purely because the British side must insist that the loan be guaranteed by the Bank of China when China needs the funds.

<h3>Japan Again Attempts to Prevent British Ships from Sailing to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: Okazaki, the Japanese Consul-General, formally notified the Reuters correspondent today that the Japanese side had previously agreed in writing for the British ship Foshan to sail to Hong Kong on June 8th, but now it will not allow it to sail out, with the reason that the British authorities do not respect the spirit and wording of the memorandum agreed upon between the British Consul-General and Okazaki. If the British side does not respect the memorandum, the Japanese side will block the British ships in the Pearl River. When the Reuters correspondent asked British Consul-General Blunt about this matter, Blunt only said that he did not believe the words of the Japanese Consul-General at all, and that he had reported everything to the superior British authorities.

<h3>Incident of British Officer Detained: British Ambassador to Japan Lodges Protest, Major Dallamey Has Returned to Beiping, Unable to Meet with Those Detained</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a statement by the British Ambassador here, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has protested to the Japanese government regarding the Japanese side detaining two British officers in Zhangjiakou and not allowing investigators sent by the British side in Beiping to see them. One of the British officers currently detained by the Japanese side in Zhangjiakou is Military Attaché Spears, who was detained by the Japanese side on May 26th. The other is translator Cooper, who was detained while visiting. As for Major Dallamey, Commander of the British Army in Tianjin, and Romm, the Chinese Attaché, they have returned to Beiping as they were unable to meet with those detained. According to reports, the two sought to meet with those detained for two days, but were ultimately unable to meet. Not only that, but their request to meet with senior Japanese military officers in the area was also rejected. It is only known that the two detained officers are currently safe and have exchanged notes with each other. The most shocking thing is that the Japanese news agency actually stated that the reason for the detention of the two British officers was that they reported the situation in the Japanese military zone to the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. (June 6th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It has been revealed that Lieutenant Colonel Spears, the British military attaché to China, and Lieutenant Colonel Cooper, the British translator, were detained in Zhangjiakou by the Japanese army on suspicion of espionage. According to the Japanese side, the Japanese side had requested that foreigners must first obtain approval before entering the Japanese military zone, but these two officers ignored it.

The Ministry of Education presented a proposal stating that teachers and students of the Si Cun Resistance War School engaged in fierce battles with the puppet regime in the vicinity of ×× in February of this year, some were killed in action, and others broke through the encirclement when their ammunition was exhausted. Historically, whenever foreign tribes invaded China, Confucian scholars rose up to advocate righteousness and died in the line of duty. The school's implementation of resistance war work was truly comparable to historical precedents. The request was to give preferential treatment to the officers and students who were killed or injured. The decision was to forward the request for commendation by explicit order and handle it in accordance with the regulations on rewarding soldiers defending the land. The Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission jointly presented a request to add (preferential treatment for students from the southwestern border areas) to the regulations on preferential treatment for Mongolian and Tibetan students.

<h3>Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance: Key to European Security, British Authorities Determined to Establish It, Germany and Two Small Baltic States to Sign Non-Aggression Pacts Today</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain separately received Foreign Secretary Halifax and Polish Ambassador Raithes today before noon. Halifax also spoke with the Estonian Minister Schmid. All of this is said to be related to the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. According to news received from various European capitals, this agreement must be established regardless, otherwise the crisis of Germany's violent actions towards the city of Danzig will intensify. According to the most reliable information, German Führer Hitler recently summoned General Liedell, Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Forces, and General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, to inquire about Germany's chances of winning if an international war were to occur at this time. The generals stated that the current situation is favorable to Germany if the Soviet Union does not join the war. Furthermore, it is generally believed that Germany intends to resolve the Polish issue within a few months and is currently preparing for it. Everything will still depend on whether Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can conclude an agreement. The British government, aware of this, will naturally strive to find a way to resolve the security issues of the Baltic coastal states without endangering their independence, so that the Anglo-Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement can be concluded as soon as possible.

<h3>Pope Has No New Suggestions for Various Countries, Nor Has He Expressed Opposition to the Anglo-Franco-Soviet Alliance</h3>
<p>Vatican City The Holy See issued a statement last night, denying rumors that the Pope had telegraphed the leaders of various European countries again, but stated that the Pope's diplomatic peace efforts, initiated some time ago, are continuing according to the plan already explained. British newspapers prominently published a telegram yesterday stating that the Pope intends to send another plea for peace to the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and other countries. The Min Sheng Daily and the Daily Mail both stated that the Pope's move is somewhat related to the Anglo-French alliance. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The claim that the Vatican has made suggestions to the authorities of a certain country has been denied by the Holy See, but it is also admitted that talks are continuing with the authorities of various countries. Diplomatic circles here recently commented that Pope Pius XII's dedication to peace can be seen in his meeting today with the British envoy to the Holy See, Mr. Spahn. It is generally believed that the Pope has not dissuaded the UK from concluding a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, but he hopes to find a practical and feasible way to resolve the issues of Danzig and the Franco-Italian issues peacefully. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government had no knowledge of the rumors that Pope Pius XII had protested against the Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance.

<h3>Sweden and Finland Determined to Maintain Neutrality, Fortifying the Åland Islands Benefits the Soviet Union as Well</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital Finnish Minister of Defense Niukkanen arrived here this morning and will hold talks with Swedish Minister of Defense Sköld. He told reporters that Finland is willing to cooperate closely with Sweden militarily and will maintain complete neutrality, avoiding participation in any bloc.

"We are prepared to explain that the plan we have devised is to protect the neutral status of the Åland Islands, which is actually beneficial to the Soviet Union," he said. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Proposals Difficult for Britain to Accept, the Issue of Guaranteeing the Baltic States Requires Careful Consideration and Planning</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee finds it difficult to accept the recent proposals made by the Soviet Union to Britain. It is reported that the committee opposes the idea that the borders of the Baltic States should be guaranteed by Britain and France. However, authoritative sources believe that rumors of a breakdown in Anglo-Soviet negotiations are exaggerated. However, the signing of a trilateral alliance will be delayed. According to a spokesman for the British government, the British government is unwilling to disregard the independence of other countries and unilaterally assume the obligation of defending them without obtaining the consent of the Baltic States. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met this morning, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain, to study the Soviet Union's reply on the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and to consider how Britain should respond. No definitive decision was made. According to Soviet sources here, the content of the country's reply is to review the drafts of Britain and France line by line, either accepting them directly or making amendments. The most important of these amendments are three in number: (1) The British and French drafts mentioned the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, so as to establish a connection between the alliance and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union now suggests amending the clause as follows: "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, in order to promote the various principles of the League of Nations Covenant and in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant, love and help each other." In that case, Article 16 of the Covenant would not need to be invoked again. (2) The British and French drafts advocated that the signatory countries consult each other. The Soviet Union believes that the consultation method can be maintained when there is no war crisis, but if such a crisis occurs, action should be taken immediately, and the methods of action should be stipulated in advance. (3) The British and French drafts advocated that any country that has not been guaranteed by the signatory countries should be assisted immediately if it is invaded and seeks assistance from one of the signatory countries. The Soviet Union believes that Finland, Latvia, and Estonia should also be guaranteed, and the names of these countries should be included in the Anglo-Franco-Soviet agreement. Sources here familiar with the matter claim that the British cabinet members are willing to find ways to resolve the first two points, but as for the third point, the Baltic coastal states are unwilling to accept the guarantee of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This attitude cannot be ignored, but at the same time, a way must be found to maintain the current state of affairs in this corner of Europe. It is very difficult to consider both aspects carefully. Generally speaking, Britain will first engage in diplomatic talks with the Soviet Union, hoping to find a novel way that all parties concerned can accept in principle, and then formally submit a new proposal to the Soviet Union.

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, a member asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain had stated in the House of Commons before the Munich Agreement was concluded that it was of great benefit if the responsible authorities of various countries could meet face to face. He asked whether he intended to formally invite the Soviet Union to visit. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that he would consider and implement his remarks from last year at any time depending on the situation. He did not know what benefit there would be from inviting the Soviet Union at this time. Mr. Adams of the opposition party then asked whether there was a barrier between Britain and the Soviet Union and whether Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip to Moscow could remove it. The Prime Minister did not answer. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Results of the Japanese Five-Minister Conference Lead to Speculation, Konoe Visits Saionji and Kan'in, Observes the Emperor, Japanese Newspapers Advocate Caution</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported that Prince Konoe, President of the Privy Council and Minister without Portfolio, had visited Saionji in Okitsu to report on the domestic and foreign situation over the past year, focusing on the international situation regarding the "China Incident." He returned to Tokyo yesterday from Okitsu. It is said that Saionji seemed very concerned about Japan's basic policy in dealing with the new situation in Europe. His visit to Saionji had no political meaning. Saionji is in good health and is very concerned about the development of the European situation. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Chief of the Army General Staff Prince Kan'in yesterday had an audience with the Emperor and reported on various matters under his jurisdiction. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government's policy on dealing with the European situation, decided yesterday, has not yet been officially announced, leading to much speculation. Sources familiar with the matter recalled the statements made by two military leaders to foreign journalists after Japan established the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy. Army Minister Itagaki said that the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact is deeply rooted and long-standing. If necessary, the conclusion of a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance is not impossible. Also, former commander of the Korean Army, Xiao, also said that negotiations for a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance are underway, but its success will depend entirely on whether Germany and Italy fully understand their situation in Europe, and Japan's position and true strength in the Far East. In addition, at the last session of the Diet, Navy Minister Yonai replied that the Anti-Comintern Pact is not a military alliance. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Only a few newspapers commented this morning on the government's final decision on how to deal with the new situation in Europe. The Chugai Commercial News said that the public was distressed that they knew nothing about the circumstances of yesterday's five-minister conference and the content of its final decision. The government should quickly announce its outline. Although the European situation should receive some attention from Japan, the China Incident is a more important issue. The Kokumin Shimbun said that since the European situation is related to the Far Eastern situation, it is important to Japan, but the government should not focus too much on the European situation, lest it hinder the resolution of the China Incident. The government should maintain a passive attitude, wait and see the development of the European situation, and not take bold steps to strengthen relations with Germany and Italy. The Japan Wide Intelligence News said that Kida, former Japanese ambassador to Germany, recently advocated that Japan should quickly conclude a large-scale military alliance with Germany and Italy. Although the government has not officially opposed this alliance, Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita have repeatedly made public statements containing disapproval of Japan being subject to a restriction that would require it to fight against Britain, France, and the Soviet Union according to the wishes of other countries, and thus be unable to concentrate on creating a new order in East Asia. Prime Minister Hiranuma recently told Japanese journalists that some politicians advocate adopting extreme methods to deal with the European situation, but such methods are fraught with danger. Japan must proceed gradually and steadily to fulfill its mission. He does not care if he is blamed for this policy. If we cannot achieve this ourselves, posterity will continue to do so. For the sake of world peace, Japan will maintain closer ties with Germany and Italy. From Hiranuma's words, the ties between Germany, Italy, and Japan can be made closer and more solid, without the need to adopt extreme methods fraught with danger. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to reports from Tokyo, Japan is unwilling to be drawn into the whirlpool of European strife unless it is used to deal with the Soviet Union, and is reluctant to offer a promise of assistance to the Axis powers. This news is well-received here. However, according to recent reports, Japanese military personnel are still seeking to get closer to Germany and Italy. The military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Italy is a strong advocate of forming a military alliance with Germany and Italy to deal with the Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance. He plans to return to Japan in the near future to strongly promote it. When he passes through here, he will secretly discuss everything with the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Germany and the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the UK.

<h3>Yugoslavia and Germany Have Not Concluded an Agreement, Prince Regent Paul Returns Home, Economic Negotiations Continue</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Prince Regent Paul of Yugoslavia and his wife, who had been visiting Berlin for four days, left for home last night. Hitler personally saw them off at the station. According to German officials, no political agreement was concluded between Germany and Yugoslavia as a result of this trip. Reports that Germany had asked Yugoslavia to connect more closely with Germany or had persuaded Yugoslavia to join the Anti-Comintern Pact were unfounded speculation. German and Yugoslav representatives are still holding economic talks in Cologne. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prince Regent Paul of Yugoslavia continued his talks with Führer Hitler today. Afterwards, an official statement was issued stating that Prince Paul continued his talks with Führer Hitler today. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovic and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were also present, lasting for several hours. Prince Paul's visit was to exchange views with the German authorities on various political issues on a broad scale. The process was extremely friendly. Both sides were able to discuss various issues related to the two countries openly and honestly, and they agreed that the current policies of the two countries should be continued because they are sincere, trusting, and closely cooperative. They also believe that this policy is constructive and is the foundation for maintaining relations between Yugoslavia and Germany and Italy, and is also one of the main factors for peace in Europe. The governments of Germany and Yugoslavia have now decided to jointly develop in the political, economic, and cultural fields on the basis of this clear and solid foundation, with the full agreement of Italy, believing that the tense state of the European situation can be eliminated by this and that progress can be made towards peace, in accordance with the rights related to the survival of all nations.

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Far Eastern Situation, Japan Has No Right to Blockade the Chinese Coast, Discrimination Against British Merchants in Qingdao Has Been Protested</h3>
<p>(London) After the House of Commons reconvened this afternoon, several members successively inquired about the Far Eastern situation. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler first commented on the issue of the Japanese navy blockading the Chinese coast, stating, "At the beginning of the war between China and Japan, the Japanese government announced a blockade of the entire Chinese coast, but at the same time, it clarified that the blockade method would only be applied to Chinese ships. In the British government's view, if this method were to be extended to the ships of other countries, it would be an attempt to exercise the rights of belligerents. However, since war has not been declared between China and Japan, a state of war cannot be considered to exist, so even if such an attempt is made, it is illegal. This view has been clearly communicated to the Japanese government." Morgan, a Labour Party member of the opposition, then asked, "Regarding the case of the British company's postal ship "Langpura" being intercepted, the Japanese government explained that it was a misunderstanding. Does the British government admit that this case has been closed?" Undersecretary Butler immediately replied, "Ships of all countries whose nationality is indeed doubtful can be inspected, but as far as "Langpura" is concerned, there is no doubt about its nationality. For this reason, we have clearly stated our position, and the Japanese side has also offered an explanation, saying that it was due to a misunderstanding." Morgan then asked, "Is this explanation satisfactory?" Undersecretary Butler is said to have replied, "Yes." Sir Sandeman, a Conservative Party member, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "As far as I know, the Japanese naval authorities in Qingdao, China, require British ships to obtain a permit for each bill of lading for goods to be unloaded. As a result, various goods are often stored in the open on the docks for several days before obtaining a permit, which may cause damage. At the same time, goods arriving in Qingdao on Japanese ships are not subject to this restriction. Is the Prime Minister aware of all these matters? Also, does the Prime Minister intend to notify the Japanese government that unless this method of restricting British trade is lifted, Britain will retaliate against Japanese ships arriving in British ports?" Undersecretary Butler immediately replied on behalf of the Prime Minister that Prime Minister Chamberlain was aware of the first two paragraphs of Sir Sandeman's inquiry. Goods arriving in Qingdao on Japanese ships have warehouses available for storage, while British ships have not yet received the same convenience. In addition to negotiations with the Japanese authorities there, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie has also negotiated with the Japanese government, hoping to obtain an answer as soon as possible. Mr. Tanharry, a Labour Party member of the opposition, asked, "The "currency" circulating in the Nanjing area of China is not recognized by foreign merchants. Regarding this matter, has the British government inquired with the Japanese government as to what measures it will take to protect British commercial interests? What was the Japanese side's reply?" Undersecretary Butler immediately presented a written reply stating, "The Huaxing Commercial Bank is a new bank established in accordance with the laws of the "Reformed Government" of China. It is permitted to issue banknotes but does not have the nature of a central bank. The total amount of capital is set at 50 million yuan. In order to maintain the exchange function of the banknotes issued, it has already stored foreign exchange equal to the amount of the issue as a reserve. This banknote is intended to supplement the existing legal tender and is not intended to replace it, and its status is the same as that of the legal tender. Except for customs duties, which are still paid in legal tender, other national taxes can be paid with banknotes from the Huaxing Bank. Also, under the current circumstances, there is no need for trade control and exchange management." (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Philippines Hastens Large-Scale National Defense Construction: Renovating the Air Force and Adding Coastal Patrol Ships, Establishing New Barracks in Strategically Important Locations</h3>
<p>Manila - The Philippine Army authorities, considering that the date of Philippine independence is only seven years away, and that the urgent situation in the Far East shows no sign of easing, have therefore engaged in a large-scale national defense construction program. In recent months, the defense construction movement of the Republic of the Philippines has focused on coastal patrol and the improvement of the air force. The number of "Q" type patrol boats will increase by two more in November of this year. According to the current plan, four or five "Q" type patrol ships will be purchased each year, so that the Philippine Navy will have forty patrol ships for coastal patrol in 1946. The equipment of these patrol boats includes heavy machine guns, torpedo laying machines, torpedoes, and bombs for attacking submarines. Eighteen aircraft of various types can be delivered to the Philippines within a few months, greatly increasing the strength of the air force, which is still in its infancy. The Army authorities pay special attention to land defense, and new barracks will soon be built in strategically important locations on the island. One of the barracks can be established in Parang, Mindanao Island, within this month. The Second Regiment of the First Regular Division plans to be permanently stationed there. The Parang Barracks will be the future defense center of the Philippine Islands and the economic development center of Mindanao Island. The highways on Mindanao Island are being built for both economic and military purposes. (6th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain and Australia Jointly Manage, Australia's Position is Extremely Important: Once War Breaks Out in the Far East, Military Supplies and Food Can Be Completely Self-Sufficient</h3>
<p>San Francisco - According to a report by the Pan-Pacific Association, the British and Australian governments are now working to make Australia a major base for British food and munitions manufacturing in the southwestern Pacific. Previously, Australia's supplies were all obtained from Britain, but if the current plan is successful, Britain will receive assistance from Australia no matter what serious events occur in the Far East. It is reported that this plan includes the establishment of storage facilities in rural Australia to avoid enemy attacks in wartime, etc. Among them, the most noteworthy is Australia's defense plan and the establishment of the munitions industry, because the success of this plan will enable Australia to be completely self-sufficient. In addition to the current industries, Australia will also add automobile, aircraft, and munitions industries. According to Australia's defense plan, it began to be implemented in May last year, and was strengthened after the Munich Agreement was concluded. As a result, although outsiders only know that Australia is an agricultural country, in fact, Australia has already ascended to an extremely important position. (6th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Naval Officer Serves as Japanese Spy: Leaking Naval Secrets, Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Supreme Court has rejected the appeal filed by Ensign Francis Wah, who confessed in 1937 to being a spy for Japan and was sentenced to imprisonment. According to the report, the ensign was arrested on July 13, 1936, for privately handing over a secret booklet of the US Navy's "Intelligence Work and Security" to the former naval attaché of the Japanese Embassy in the United States. After the Maritime Intelligence Office investigated his resume, it was discovered that this person had always been of improper conduct. He joined the Naval Academy in 1912 and graduated in 1915. Later, he also studied aviation. In 1927, he was tried by a military court in the Navy for negligence, (1) for violating the regulations of the Navy Department, (2) for private misconduct, which implicated the discipline and reputation of the Navy.

<p>(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee today began drafting a new bill to amend the Neutrality Act. Assistant Secretary of State Moore, Legal Advisor Hackworth, and Legal Expert Savage were all invited to attend to explain the State Department's views.

In other words, the president will enjoy greater freedom when invoking the Neutrality Act. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Circumstances of British Submarine Disaster: Prime Minister Reports to the House of Commons, Preparation for a Public Investigation</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons the circumstances of the disaster of the submarine "Thetis," saying that the case will be subject to a full and open investigation, and the Navy will also conduct a routine investigation. The report and evidence will be submitted to a public investigation for reference. The selection of the members of the public investigation committee is currently under active consideration. A member asked whether the public investigation will be conducted after the submarine is salvaged. The Prime Minister replied that it will be carried out as soon as possible, but a satisfactory conclusion cannot be reached until the submarine is salvaged and everything in the submarine is investigated. The Prime Minister also said that the tides have been very rapid in recent days, so divers can only enter the depths of the sea at high tide, making rescue work very difficult. It was said that the submarine suffered the disaster because it carried too many people, but this was not the case. Its sinking was caused by seawater filling the two front compartments of the submarine through the torpedo tubes. One of the torpedo tubes has already been opened, or was opened when the submarine was submerged in the water. This proves the above statement. The Prime Minister recounted the circumstances of the rescue of the submarine, saying that the rescue ship "Brazen" arrived and soon found the location of the sunken submarine, and communicated with the submarine by sonar signals. After a while, two people emerged from the sea using Davis escape gear. One was Captain Woram. He knew that the sunken submarine had been found, so he took a great risk to escape from the sunken submarine in order to direct the rescue work. His courage is admirable. Woram claimed that although everyone in the submarine was still alive, the situation in the submarine was gradually deteriorating. Soon, two more people floated to the surface. At that time, one diver entered the water to investigate and felt that it was very difficult to work. It was planned to drill a hole in the stern of the submarine, but it was abandoned because it was of no use. Before high tide, an attempt was made to tie an iron chain to the submarine and pull it up, but the chain broke and the submarine sank again. After several hours, the new location of the sunken submarine was found. At that time, deep-sea divers had arrived, so they resumed diving work, but it was obviously too late to rescue everyone in the submarine, so they only engaged in salvaging the submarine. The submarine had water pouring into the front compartment when adjusting the equipment in the submarine after diving. The main ballast was emptied by compressed air in order to make the submarine lighter and float to the surface, but the submarine still sank and was stranded on the seabed at a depth of 130 feet, forming an acute angle of 35 degrees.

<h3>The United States, Both Government and Public, Prepare for a Warm Welcome to the British King: South Irish Republican Army Chief of Staff Arrested, Measures Taken to Prevent Possible Misconduct</h3>
<p>Montreal - The British King and Queen are spending the night in their train tonight, and the train is speeding eastward all night. Before the King and Queen cross the border into the United States, they will only stop at three places. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Tens of thousands of people have already arrived here. It is expected that on Thursday, more than 500,000 people will line the two-mile road that the British King and Queen will pass through. At that time, there will be 6,000 soldiers, seven military bands, cavalry, tanks, and police on motorcycles marching on the road. At the same time, there will be bombers and fighters flying in the sky. Flags and decorations have been hung on all the houses along the way, and the sidewalks will be fenced with iron chains to prevent people from breaking into the road. Secret detectives and police authorities have arranged strict security measures. British Ambassador Lindsay and US Secretary of State Hull are scheduled to depart for Niagara Falls today to welcome the British King and Queen. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Detroit, USA - General Russell, Chief of Staff of the South Irish Republican Army, was arrested here last night. (According to reports, the bombing cases that have occurred in various parts of the United Kingdom were committed by members of the Republican Army.) He is being closely monitored by the authorities and is forbidden to meet with lawyers. Some believe that the British King and Queen will arrive in Windsor, Ontario, Canada today, which is separated from this city by only a river. The authorities may fear that Russell has ulterior motives, so they arrested him as a precautionary measure. The local "Free Press" recently reported that General Russell had just arrived here yesterday from Chicago with MacBride, an important figure in the Republican Army, and was arrested at the station. MacBride was released shortly afterwards. According to his statement, General Russell came to the United States six weeks ago and traveled and lectured in various places. This time he came to Detroit with no special intentions. (6th Havas)</p>
<h3>Bulgaria and Italy Sign Cultural Agreement</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria - A cultural agreement between Bulgaria and Italy was formally signed today by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov and the Italian Minister to Bulgaria. It mainly stipulates that Italian will be a compulsory subject in middle schools. Apart from this, it is not much different from the cultural agreements signed by Bulgaria with other countries. However, one point is quite important, that is, the Italian side uses the name of "King of Italy, Emperor of Abyssinia, and King of Albania", so Bulgaria has de facto recognized Italy's annexation of Albania.

<h3>German and Italian Volunteers Return Home in Triumph: Hitler and the Italian King Hold Separate Reviews</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German "Condor" team of volunteers, after withdrawing from Spain, was reviewed by Hitler this morning at 10:00 in the city center. Participants, together with volunteers who had previously returned to the country in the Condor team, totaled 18,000 people. Air Minister General Göring, several Spanish generals, and the Spanish Ambassador Magaz, the Italian Ambassador Adolico, and the Japanese Ambassador General Oshima were all present. The welcome ceremony was held in Lustgarten until 12:30 in the afternoon. General Göring immediately gave a speech, praising the achievements of the "Condor" team soldiers, saying, "Your triumphant return is completely different from the situation in 1918. The German nation has now regained its sight, led by a great soldier, and the other leaders are also brave soldiers." Hitler then gave a brief speech on the Spanish Civil War in 1936, saying, "In July of that year, after obtaining the consent of Italy, we decided to assist General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army. This move was not only sufficient to save Europe, but also sufficient to save Germany. General Franco is a brave man who was able to save his country from danger and stop the invasion of Bolshevism. Our volunteers were right to go to the rescue. However, the multi-headed political democratic countries criticized it and reversed right and wrong. At this time, if those who promote the encirclement policy dare to invade our country, they will definitely be met with a painful blow. In short, the struggle we waged in Spain is enough to teach the enemy a lesson." The Führer then praised the bravery of the Italian volunteers and the Spanish soldiers, and shouted "Long live the Spanish nation and General Franco," "Long live the Italian nation and Prime Minister Mussolini," "Long live the German nation and the Condor team."

<h3>The Duchess of Kent, Brother of the British King, is Endangered While Driving Out: The Residence Window of the British King's Sister, Princess Mary, Was Also Broken: Generally, It is Believed That There is a Considerable Connection Between These Two Cases</h3>
<p>(London) The Duchess of Kent, brother of the British King, was driving to a movie theater in the West End tonight when someone fired at the car, but the car body was not hit. Not only was the Duchess not injured, but she was also unaware of it until someone told her about it after arriving at the movie theater. However, the person who fired the shot has been arrested by the police. It is said that this person came here from Australia three weeks ago and has been wandering around the Duchess's residence every day, and his actions are very suspicious. At the same time, the window of the residence of the Earl of Harewood (that is, George VI's sister, Princess Mary) was also broken by someone, mostly by air gun bullets. Some people believe that there may be a considerable connection between these two cases, but the police authorities do not attach importance to the latter. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the shooting at the Duchess of Kent last night, the Daily Mirror recently reported, "A man named Kilkuth was driving past the scene at this time when he suddenly heard a gunshot. He quickly stopped the car and looked around, and saw a man sitting on the ground with a gun, pointing the muzzle at the street, with a bicycle next to him. He immediately questioned him, but the man's words were vague and incomprehensible, so he drove to the police station to report it. Then, a policeman accompanied him to the scene and saw the man still sitting in the same place, so he arrested him and took him to the police station. It was verified that the gun he was carrying had just been fired, and he was immediately detained, and it was found that he had come here from Australia two weeks ago. It is said that the Duke of Kent has been appointed as the Governor-General of Australia and is scheduled to go to take office with the Duchess in October of this year. (6th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Europe: London Dispatch – The Gathering Storm over the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>— Shudi</p>
<p>Following Litvinov's resignation, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which had been proceeding cautiously, loosened up. Now, the Soviet representative originally scheduled to attend the Geneva conference, Potemkin, unexpectedly cancelled his planned trip a few days ago. Consequently, the Anglo-Soviet cooperation talks, which had reached a considerable stage, were temporarily put on hold. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that these negotiations will be seriously revived in the near future.</p>
<p>This shelving of Anglo-Soviet negotiations is, in reality, merely a phenomenon, a result, and certainly not the cause. What is the reason for it? There are two main and direct reasons: First, on the bright side, it is due to the recent establishment of the Anglo-Turkish alliance. From Britain's perspective, this has completely laid the foundation for a future Anglo-Soviet alliance. Now, most of the countries surrounding the Soviet Union have entered into mutual or unilateral assistance agreements with Britain. In her view, this already demonstrates complete sincerity in cooperating with the Soviet Union. As for further solidifying her alliance relationship with the Soviet Union through a treaty, that is merely a matter of procedure. However, Britain does not feel it necessary at this time, as she has not yet made a firm decision to strike at the global aggressor nations. From the Soviet Union's perspective, because Potemkin recently visited the Balkan Peninsula and Poland, he has confirmed the trust of various countries in the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the surrounding countries have already formed alliances with Britain, the Soviet Union does not necessarily need to be eager to form an alliance with Britain. Thus, in essence, Britain became complacent, and the Soviet Union became lax. Second, on the dark side, recently within Britain, because Mussolini delivered a relatively peaceful speech in Turin, the power of the pro-German appeasement faction has risen again. They are still advising the current government to make another attempt at negotiations with Germany, offering some possible concessions as conditions for Hitler to accept "peace," and asking him to specifically put them forward. As a result, the current British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, has received orders to immediately present two points to the German authorities: (1) If Germany genuinely desires "peace," then it should hurry and propose it while Britain is still "willing to listen"; (2) Otherwise, in his "personal" view, Britain is now in a completely superior international military position vis-à-vis Germany. Therefore, when Britain had essentially become complacent, on the surface, she deliberately made a great show of negotiating Anglo-Soviet cooperation, while on the other hand, she was conducting behind-the-scenes haggling negotiations with Germany. At this time, for the sake of diplomatic maneuvering, the Soviet Union adopted the tactic of Potemkin suddenly halting his trip to Geneva.</p>
<p>As a result, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been temporarily suspended. Consequently, the overall situation in Europe has also eased for a short period. However, everyone should immediately pay close attention to the fact that, on the other hand, the Anglo-Soviet stalemate has therefore fallen into a tense web. Is the possibility of a Soviet-German rapprochement progressing again? Like a venomous insect, this question is persistently gnawing at the hearts of the Anglo-French appeasers.</p>
<p>Thus, in the past few days, Anglo-French public opinion has again been vigorously pressuring the government, and the government has had no choice but to quickly take steps to reassure the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This is one of the main items for the upcoming Halifax-Bonnet talks in Paris.</p>
<p>These are the most important trends in Europe today. However, here we encounter a question: Why? Since Britain and France only wish to maintain a consistent stance with the Soviet Union, mainly to bargain with Germany and Italy, why are they so anxious upon hearing even a hint of a German-Soviet rapprochement?</p>
<p>The answer to this question, at the most urgent point, lies in the tension of the situation in the Mediterranean Sea, so the eyes of all of Europe are currently focused on the developing storm over the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Now, please open a map of Europe. At the western end of the Mediterranean Sea, the only opening to the ocean is the world-famous Strait of Gibraltar. At the eastern end, it is the Suez Canal, which connects to the Red Sea. Everyone knows that this is the most vital lifeline for maritime transport for Britain and France. However, at the same time, everyone also knows that this is the only and most fundamental base for Germany and Italy to develop their dreams of a great empire.</p>
<p>In previous dispatches, this reporter has pointed out some recent military preparations and political conspiracies of Germany and Italy in Africa. The part of Africa referred to there is located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Naturally, those preparations and conspiracies have not stopped recently, but have intensified. However, there have been no noteworthy new developments. What is attracting our attention now is at both ends of the Mediterranean Sea: the western end, the shifting situation in Spain; the eastern end, the hesitation and divergent paths of the Balkan countries – fundamentally speaking, it is the same thing: the pressure from Germany and Italy is intensifying.</p>
<p>(1) There are two most noteworthy events in the recent situation in Spain: First, the German fleet unexpectedly left; second, Göring's planned trip to Spain was suddenly cancelled. These indicate one thing: There are problems again in the process of Germany and Italy exerting pressure on Franco to turn him into a completely submissive slave.</p>
<p>Of course, Franco will eventually remain a slave, but the problems, although not big, still exist.</p>
<p>Where are the problems? Everyone knows that Franco has accepted the pressure from Germany and Italy and joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact." He has also offered almost all the land to the strategists of Germany and Italy as a base for their future war against Britain and France, arranging it in advance. However, there is one thing that he has not accepted to this day: On the day of formally celebrating the victory of the civil war, he clearly stated to Britain that he would reclaim the lost territory – the British-owned Gibraltar naval port in the Strait of Gibraltar. Franco has been refusing this all along, because his thoughts of borrowing money from Britain and France have never ceased. Therefore, the date of celebrating "victory" has been postponed again and again. Correspondingly, the issue of Germany and Italy withdrawing volunteer soldiers, which has been anxiously demanded by Britain and France, Germany and Italy have also refused to budge.</p>
<p>This stalemate continued until recently, when it suddenly brewed into two very serious crises involving both domestic and foreign affairs: Based on Germany, the leader of the most reactionary fascist faction in Spain, the current Minister of the Interior, Suñer, recently planned a political conspiracy to replace Franco. This was suddenly exposed, greatly displeasing Franco to Germany. Therefore, as a demonstration, on the one hand, he requested Germany and Italy in writing to first show him where they were superior to the British and French armies; otherwise, he was unwilling to openly oppose Britain. On the other hand, he told the British ambassador that, in fact, he would eventually break with Germany and Italy, but "the time was not yet ripe." If this situation continues to develop, unless Franco completely surrenders or is overthrown entirely, then the forces of international struggle may take advantage of Spain as a stage to have another civil war. At the same time, in that Spain under Franco's rule, the old forces of the former government army are lurking here and there, waiting for an opportunity to reappear. This is the first crisis at the moment. It is said that, in order to completely eradicate the possibility of British financial forces infiltrating Spain, the recent German ambassador to Spain suddenly received orders. Based on this, he warned Franco that March, Franco's biggest financial backer, who is generally considered to be too pro-British, must be removed immediately. However, Franco actually refused. Therefore, this has now created another tension between Germany and Italy and Franco, becoming the second crisis. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Active Chinese Troops in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Area: Gunfire Heard in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Chinese troops in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area have been very active recently. A brief account is as follows:</p>
<p>Hangzhou Area</p>
<p>Chinese troops in the four suburbs of Hangzhou have approached the city, so gunfire is often heard in the city. Skirmishes have occurred near Songmuchang and outside Qingbo Gate. As a result, more than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed or captured. Chinese troops on the outskirts of Tanglou Town in the Hangzhou suburbs also attacked a Japanese motorboat, killing more than 20 Japanese and puppet soldiers. Several piers of the Qianjiang Bridge have been blown up by Chinese commandoes on the south bank. The Japanese garrison in the Shihuiqiao area on the outskirts of the city was set on fire by Chinese troops. When the flames soared into the sky, the Japanese soldiers fled from the fire, some being killed or wounded.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Area</p>
<p>The base of the Chinese guerrilla forces in Baihuating near Haiyan County was attacked by more than 200 Japanese soldiers the other day. The Chinese troops blocked the Japanese and surrounded them. The Japanese used sulfur guns to disrupt the Chinese forces. As a result, the Chinese completely annihilated the Japanese soldiers, but 181 civilian houses in the town were burned down by bullets. The other day, 50 or 60 Japanese soldiers passing through Xiaochizhen in the county were also severely attacked by Chinese troops, with no Japanese soldiers surviving. Chinese troops in the southern suburbs of Jiaxing were planning to attack the Japanese camp in the seed breeding ground on the outskirts of the city. However, when they reached Shiba Liqiao, ten miles from the city, they encountered more than 100 Japanese soldiers. A fierce battle broke out. Later, the Chinese troops feigned defeat and lured the Japanese to Gujiabangyiwangqiao, where they used the terrain to surround and annihilate the Japanese. At the same time, another unit of Chinese troops attacked the Japanese defenses in Guojie Township (the ancient battlefield of Wu and Yue). A fierce artillery battle broke out between the two sides. The result is unknown, but according to eyewitnesses, Japanese corpses were transported by trucks along the Hangzhou-Jiaxing Highway, indicating that the Japanese suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Jiashan Area</p>
<p>Fierce battles have been taking place in Zhangjinghui, the northern suburbs of the city, Jiuliwan, and other places since the 1st. In order to protect railway transportation, the Japanese army forced local people to wear Japanese military uniforms, carry guns, and sit in trains to patrol, while more than a dozen Japanese soldiers were hiding in the trains. It is said that since the implementation of this measure, about 50 Chinese have been killed by guerrillas who mistakenly identified them as Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Huzhou Area</p>
<p>Chinese troops in the four suburbs of Wuxing, in Qingshan, once raided the Japanese camp in a nearby area at night. Japanese soldiers in Xinshi have been wiped out. A fierce battle broke out in the southern suburbs of Wuzhen. The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory and advanced towards the Japanese defenses in Nan Zha. Twelve Japanese cavalrymen in the Liujiaoshi area were killed by the Chinese, who also captured twelve war horses. Battles have also been taking place in the outskirts of Wangjiang for several days. The most fierce battle occurred last night when the railway was destroyed, and battles broke out with Japanese and puppet soldiers. Shen Mingcai, the magistrate of Chongde County, led the self-defense corps to raid the Japanese troops in Shimen in the middle of the night the other day, killing and capturing many. Chinese troops in the outskirts of Tongxiang rushed directly to the city the day before yesterday. The Japanese soldiers in the city opened the north gate and fled. The Chinese troops took the opportunity to rush in, but soon gave up. Chinese troops in Pinghu have captured Quan Gongting and launched a fierce attack on the city walls last night. Three Japanese boats near Liushe in Deqing were discovered by the Chinese, who threw more than a dozen hand grenades from the bridge, sinking all the motorboats.</p>

<h3>Commemorating Teacher's Day: Dedicated to the Wise Teachers</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tuo</p>
<p>Wise teachers, education is the lifeblood of the country. It is the main factor for the inevitable victory of the war of resistance. It is the permanent foundation for national reconstruction after the war. What a great responsibility you bear.</p>
<p>However, please ask yourselves, how much effort have you exerted in the past in the field of education? Have you let down the general youth in any way? How has the educational effect you have achieved affected society? Can you give an account to the country?</p>
<p>Wise teachers,</p>
<p>You are the mentors of the youth. Your words and deeds need to be exemplary. You must also do your best to promote our initiative and avoid the deeply ingrained negativity of the past thousands of years. For example, doubt, friction, laziness, and pleasure are all biased towards negativity. They not only cannot promote all undertakings, but also consume a lot of useful energy, hinder a lot of progress, and even delay the major affairs of the country. Each of us must put the interests of the country and the nation first. We must propagate for the country and the nation, act for the country and the nation, and think for the country and the nation. In short, we must engage in education for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Wise teachers,</p>
<p>I have always believed that the quality of a teacher depends solely on asking him whether his faith in the country and the nation is firm, whether he has a deep understanding of the essence of education, and whether he can regard education as a lifelong career and view students as his own children. I also believe that there is no so-called teaching method in education. Only the word "loyalty" is the only way to teach. The attitude of a teacher should have three conditions: learning without boredom, teaching without weariness, and acting without confusion. Learning without boredom is the advancement of knowledge. Teaching without weariness is the effort of teaching. Acting without confusion is the determination of will. These three are not only the attitudes that teachers should have, but also the correct outlook on life for teachers. Wise teachers,</p>
<p>Who in the world is more hardworking and meritorious than you? And who is more sinful than you? Because the progress and fall of children and youth, saving the country and betraying the country, building the country and harming the country are all in your hands. Therefore, you are not only the leaders of the students, but also the mentors of the entire country and nation. However, since the responsibility you bear is so great, and the treatment you receive is very meager, yet you can still tirelessly teach people and bury yourself in hard work. Everyone admires and appreciates your great spirit of sacrifice. On behalf of the compatriots across the country, I pay my respects to you.</p>
<h3>Most of the Elementary Schools in the Soviet Guerrilla Areas Have Been Restored: War Education is Promoted in Accordance with Ministry Orders</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is very thoughtful in promoting the education plan in the guerrilla areas in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of Education. In addition to establishing private schools in various townships and towns, all public elementary schools in various counties, which were automatically closed after the fall, have now mostly resumed classes.</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Department of Education Urges the Payment of the Centennial Education Fund: To Emphasize the Education Cause</h3>
<p>(Fangyan Dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education advocated raising a Centennial Education Fund, originally to thoroughly cultivate educational talents. For several years, education agencies in various cities and counties have handled it, and the results have been quite effective. Since the outbreak of the military, counties such as Hang, Jia, and Hu in western Zhejiang have become war zones, and the matter of handling the Centennial Education Fund has inevitably been affected. However, the education agencies in eastern Zhejiang can still continue to carry it out with great effort, but the effectiveness has been greatly reduced. The Education Department has issued a special order to the municipal and county governments to quickly collect and remit the funds as many education agencies have not paid the Centennial Fund on time in recent months, in order to emphasize the education cause and not be negligent.</p>
<h3>The Education Weekly is Published</h3>

<h3>Securities: The Downward Trend of Foreign Debt Has Not Been Contained, Domestic Debt is Still Hovering, and Foreign Stocks are Still Mostly Quoted Higher</h3>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt market prices on the 5th of this month (Monday) once again saw a downward trend, with various bonds falling by half a pound to three pounds. Among the top-tier public bonds, the Anglo-French loan English-issued bond fell by three pounds, with a price of fifty-four pounds. The Crisp Loan fell by two pounds, with a price of thirty-three pounds. The Anglo-German Continued Loan English-issued bond and the In克斯 Aircraft English-issued bond each fell by one pound, with the former priced at sixty-four pounds, a new low for this year, and the latter priced at sixteen and a half pounds. The Sino-French US Dollar 5% bond, the printed bond and the Rehabilitation Loan English-issued bond each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at sixty-one and a half pounds and the latter priced at forty-nine and a half pounds. The lower-tier railway bonds, starting with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway bond, remained stable, but the first five types fluctuated by half a pound to one pound. The Longhai Railway printed bond uniquely rose by half a pound, with a price of eighteen pounds. The Hukuang Railway non-German issued printed bond fell by half a pound, with a price of twenty-one pounds. The remaining three types each fell by half a pound, with the Daokou-Qinghua Railway bond priced at twenty pounds, the Hukuang Railway German-issued printed bond priced at nineteen and a half pounds, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway bond priced at twenty-four pounds. In the London physical market, there was strong demand for Rehabilitation Loan bonds, with 5,000 pounds of English-issued bonds sold at a price of forty-nine pounds, a discount from the market price of pounds. In addition, 10,000 pounds of French-issued printed bonds were sold at a price of forty-seven pounds, a discount of two and a half pounds from the English-issued listed price. In addition, 12,500 pounds of Russian-issued printed bonds were sold at a price of forty-three and a half pounds, a discount of six pounds from the English-issued listed price. However, regarding the Rehabilitation Loan French-issued printed bonds, it is reported that there is an appetite for 1,600 pounds, with no limit price set. Also, in the local market, there are also 50,000 pounds of Tianjin-Pukou Railway Continued Loan German-issued unprinted bonds, also without a limit price for purchase.</p>
<p>Ever since the Anglo-French incident with China, the acknowledgement of the current situation everywhere has caused one side's arrogance to increase, with a great possibility of joining Germany and Italy to threaten England and France. As a result, the interests of England and France in the Far East are in jeopardy, and almost all of the customs and salt taxes have been seized, leaving the principal and interest unpaid. The exchange stabilization fund lent to it has been absorbed by the Japanese side in various ways due to the maintenance of the black market. As a result, there is considerable nostalgia for Chinese bonds in Europe. Therefore, the decline in foreign debt over the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>Compared with May 30, the Anglo-German Continued Loan (English-issued) fell by 3.50, the Sino-French US Dollar (printed) fell by 1.75, the Anglo-French Loan (English-issued) fell by 6.75, the Crisp Loan fell by 2.75, and the Rehabilitation English Gold (English-issued) fell by 2.25.</p>
<p>In the domestic debt gray market, yesterday's market situation, after hovering, was exhausted and then recovered. The multi-party defenses were extremely strong, and the sellers ultimately felt weak. The situation on the floor was most noteworthy, that is, whenever the market price was slightly lower, trading immediately decreased; when the market price was slightly higher, there was excitement and lively trading. It can be seen that most people have extremely strong confidence in public bonds, because the Ding category is about to hold its seventh lottery drawing, and all unified public bonds will pay interest. Therefore, short sellers are wary. Since the environment has not changed and people's minds are stable, and because the US and French ambassadors went to Chongqing together, which is said to be related to the war, the multi-party's confidence is even stronger. Yesterday's activity: When the market opened in the morning, there was considerable appetite for number 35, and the market price once rose slightly. Subsequently, the selling pressure increased, with Yuyuan Runli selling the most. Yongkang Lemao Songmao also sold, although numbers 5, 16, and Tongkang absorbed some, it still failed to stabilize. The Bing category once broke through the three-yuan mark. In the after-market, Runli turned from selling to buying, and Tongkang turned from buying to selling, showing that people's minds were not unified. However, number 35 continued to buy, and Dafeng also gradually showed appetite. Lianhe stopped selling, and retail investors mostly sold, mostly chaotic and unstable. The market price result: the Jia, Yi, and Bing categories had no gains or losses, while the Ding and Wu categories each fell slightly by one jiao. The total transaction volume was more than 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>There were no stock transactions, but the seller of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company shares asked for 7 yuan and 7 jiao, which has not yet been成交.</p>
<p>In the Public Industry Association, the stock market opened slightly weak, but soon many buyers appeared, and the market atmosphere became active and firm. Jardine shares had no fluctuations for several weeks, but suddenly turned excellent yesterday. Buyers scrambled to buy, rising from 18 yuan and 8 jiao to 19 yuan and 6 jiao. International Trust shares rose to 5 yuan, and Yangtze Bank shares rose to 8 yuan, both appearing strong. Yiesong shares were slightly better at a price of 110 yuan (excluding interest of 4 yuan). Yeguang shares were stable at a price of 9 yuan and 8 jiao. Although the transaction volume of Reclamation shares was very large, the price change was very small. Kaiping shares rose to 31 yuan and 5 jiao following the London price increase. As for the six-tael preference shares of electricity, previously there were two estates, one of which held a majority of these shares and wanted to liquidate and sell them. However, it is now expected that these shares have been sold off, so they have risen to 128 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The rubber stock market was slightly calm, but there was no mass selling. The transaction prices of English Chartered shares and Rubber Trust shares were almost the same as before. The stock of British rubber raw materials increased by 998 tons last week, and now there are a total of 65,508 tons in stock.</p>
<p>The China General Edison Company's eight-percent bonds dramatically rose from 60 taels to 73 taels. Although the bonds have risen to 73 taels, they are still cheap compared to the price of common shares. If calculated on this basis, each hundred taels of eight-percent bonds, at the market price, is equivalent to 260 shares of common stock. However, calculating the value of the eight-percent bonds, it should be more than the above-mentioned number of common shares. Now, if the price of common shares is counted in jiao, then the bonds can be worth 105 taels and 6 qian. Sooner or later, the values of the two will balance, either the price of common shares will decrease, or the price of bonds will rise.</p>
<p>London English Far East Company stocks on the 5th of this month (Monday) saw a slight increase. HSBC shares each rose by one pound, with English-registered shares rising to eighty-six pounds and Hong Kong-registered shares rising to eighty-seven pounds. The Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares recovered by six pence, with a price of twenty-one shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Frightening News - Single Yarn Plummets by 47 Yuan</h3>
<p>The downstream yarn market is experiencing an increasingly severe decline. Sales to customer groups have stalled, morale is weak, and those holding excess inventory are slightly selling off. The trading floor is loosening. As for the 32-count "Fairy Maiden" single yarn, which had been soaring for days, its demand dried up and plummeted by 47 yuan. However, it is said that in the afternoon, the Hunan customer group bought a few bales, and the upward trend resumed, recovering 20 yuan. This kind of up-and-down situation is unimaginable in the business world. In fact, it has already entered its peak, and the changes are therefore vast. It is found that actual sales on the market are indeed sluggish, and retail sellers are unloading at market prices. However, two large companies are still coming to buy. The Chaoshan customer group has been buying a lot in recent days and will naturally take a break to digest their inventory before buying again.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, at the opening of the market this morning, the opinions of the industry peers were moderate. After the general mobile brokers inquired around, the customer groups did not show any buying activity, and the situation was lazy. The opening price fell by about four or five yuan. The spot price of 20-count "Double Horse" is currently 428 or 429 yuan, and the warehouse order price is 420 yuan. The customer demand for 32-count single yarn, which has been soaring in recent days, has stopped, and buyers are scarce. Only three bales of "Fairy Maiden" were sold, a drop of 47 yuan from the previous day to 615 yuan. However, those with a large amount of stock are still unwilling to sell. A certain cotton firm suddenly bought 20-count "Double Globe" because the price fell too much, recovering a few yuan in an instant. At the close of the market, the spot price of "Double Horse" was 430 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 424 yuan and a half. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong customer group bought a little, and the market situation turned quiet. The Hunan customer group bought fifteen bales of 32-count "Fairy Maiden" single yarn, and the price rose again by 20 yuan to 635 yuan. The spot price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 430 yuan and 5 jiao, and the warehouse order price was 425 yuan and a half. It is found that the total amount bought by various customer groups throughout the day was 1,425 bales. The market price of 32-count "Fairy Maiden" single yarn fell sharply by 27 yuan compared with the price of the previous day, 20-count "Double Horse" fell by 3 yuan, "Shepherd" fell by 3 yuan, "Double Globe" fell by 1 yuan, and 10-count "Boy Scout Double Globe" fell by 1.2 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 150 bales of 5-count 2-ply "Boy Scout" at a price of 350 yuan (full deduction), with delivery from June to September. Rongfeng Factory opened 75 bales of 18-count "Golden Bridge" at a price of 335 yuan, with delivery from July to September. Hefeng Factory opened 100 bales of 8-count "Ren Zhong" at a price of 350 yuan (full deduction), with delivery from June to September. Today, there were 370 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Tianjin, 100 pieces transported to Yantai, 1,270 pieces transported to Shantou, 610 pieces transported to Hong Kong, 120 pieces transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 625 pieces transported to Beihai. The amount bought by each customer group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market started well and then leveled off, and the result was not much different from the previous day. The market sentiment in the North Road area was slightly higher due to some business. The closing price of 20-count "Yueqin" for this month was 371 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Prices Rise Daily, Making it Difficult for Manufacturers to Buy</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market is particularly active. Because various rumors about barter are quite strong, the number of cloths sold has greatly increased in recent days, arousing purchases from domestic and foreign parties, especially from European parties. However, there has been no news about the government's loan of cotton until now. The spot market is extremely scarce, so the selling price is high. The price for July has reached a new high of 9.18. According to the current trend, it is still possible to continue to rise. Yesterday, New York rose 10 to 15 points, India, including the same price measurement, rose sharply by 3 rupees, and Egypt rose 20 points. The legal tender cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton rising by 1 yuan and 6 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rising by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rising by 1 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, because the overseas cotton market is rising, various parties have a strong intention to purchase, but they cannot start. Therefore, they can only temporarily wait and see. Yesterday, among the industry peers, there were some transactions for Indian cotton 10-count raw material "Plain Fruit", with a total of 1,000 bales being traded yesterday, all shipped in June and July. There were no transactions from the factory side. The equivalent factory prices of yesterday's cotton market are listed below:</p>
<p>The business in Chinese cotton is still at a standstill. As for foreign cotton, the price has been gradually rising in the past two days, and the conversion price is very high. All parties are also hesitant to purchase. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign cotton transactions are quiet. Only one transaction was made for spot cotton: one hundred and twenty-five pieces of Xiasha packaged cotton were traded among industry peers at a price of 179 yuan and 3 jiao, with payment and delivery at the warehouse. 110 bales of cotton from Subei arrived in Tongzhou. Today, there were 30 pieces of cotton transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Cocoon Transport to Shanghai - Conflicting Rumors - What Can Be Done if Transport is Impossible?</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou line has already ceased cocoon transport, and the date of arrival in Shanghai is still uncertain. Moreover, there are many rumors, which make people in the industry extremely anxious. Now, news has come from a certain party that there are two "methods" for solving the problem of spring cocoons coming to Shanghai. One is that all fresh cocoons can be transported to Shanghai after paying certain "taxes". However, there is an attached condition, that is, after this dried cocoon is reeled into silk, it must be sold to a certain Japanese trading firm for export before it can pass. Second, "Central China" intends to force cocoon merchants to sell half of the dried cocoons it collects to "Huaxing" at its price before it can be transported to Shanghai. Before these two points are confirmed, they can only be regarded as rumors. However, these two rumors also have their roots, that is, the Japanese are invading China, that is, monopolizing the Chinese market, and that is, squeezing out the economic interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in China. Therefore, it is also possible to use the detention of cocoons as a condition that they must be sold to Japanese trading firms for export. However, it feels that these methods seem too clumsy. Secondly, the saying that "Central China" intends to forcibly buy half of the cocoons is the prelude to robbing all of them. How it will develop in the future still needs to be proven by facts. Among the more accurate news that can be revealed by the more solid and or can peek inside the curtain, there is news from Japanese trading firms that there have been several cases of internal accusations within "Central China" due to conflicting opinions and interests regarding the robbery of this material. It seems more valuable. However, according to people in the industry, Shanghai silk factories that went to collect cocoons are also responsible for the heavy obstacles to spring cocoons in Zhejiang, that is, the concentration of fresh cocoons by the few factories in the Jiahu area led to a drop in cocoon prices (only half of that in the Wuxi area). This kind of low-priced cocoon collection is also akin to making a fortune from national disasters, which is naturally envied by the puppet organization and the invaders. Coupled with the various special conditions after the war, there is a scene of the mantis catching the cicada and the oriole behind. There is always someone stronger, and as I write this, I am truly sighing. (Xiang)</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Prices Rebound, Local Silk Sales Active</h3>
<p>The overseas silk market rebounded sharply yesterday. Yokohama spot prices rose by 40 yuan, forward prices rose by 27 yuan, New York spot prices rose by 1 jiao in the near term, forward prices rose by 8 fen, and Japanese silk spot prices rose by 4 fen to 5 fen. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 5 fen. This proves that the prediction in the magazine was accurate.</p>
<p>After the fall in the local silk market last week, it turned quiet. Yesterday, driven by the rise in overseas silk prices, silk sales in the UK, US, and France became active. Renchang, Renji, Dachang, and other firms all increased their purchases yesterday. Unfortunately, because manufacturers still held firm prices, the transaction volume only reached 100 dan. According to the sales firm's report, the price of white factory silk with an 85-fen uniformity was 1,930 yuan, the price of 78-fen coarse striped silk was 1,870 yuan, the XB price was 1,820 yuan, and the zebra grade was 1,840 yuan, not far from the price before the sharp fall in silk prices.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Hovers, Trading Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold gray market situation was first down and then up, showing a hovering trend. At first, because the spot firms had a strong desire to sell and some bulls in a certain gold firm also came to close their positions, the market was weak. Later, retail investors took advantage of the low price to buy, and the South China customer group also came to activity, gradually turning firm and finally reversing to rise by 3 yuan. There were very few transactions, with only more than 300 taels traded throughout the day. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops was 1 yuan lower, the price of customs gold remained the same, and the prices of Sino-English pure gold, etc., fell slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gray Market Rose by 2 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial market situation was still weak, with a price of 2,093 yuan for each bar (ten taels) by the first by the spot firm for a total of 70 taels to a money exchange shop, which was 1 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Not long after, the bull in a certain gold firm also came to close their positions, selling 100 taels to the money exchange shop, all at a price of 92 yuan. At that time, retail investors took advantage of the low price to buy, and customer groups also had a desire to buy, so it gradually recovered. The money exchange shop bought 50 taels from the silver shop customer group at a price of 93 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from fellow merchants at a price of 94 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm (on behalf of the South China customer group) bought 50 taels from the securities customer group, and the price jumped up by 2 yuan, to 96 yuan. After that, supply and demand became scarce, and no transactions were seen until noon, so the noon closing price was still 96 yuan. The market was quite quiet in the afternoon, and there were no transactions for a long time. It was not until 3:45 that the spot firm sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange shop, still at a price of 96 yuan, which was quite stable. Until the evening closing price, it was still 2,096 yuan, a result of a 2 yuan rise from the previous day. The whole day was only 4 yuan high and low. The spot firm's gold book offered a price of 1,100 yuan, and took in 2,090 yuan. The current margin is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is a price but no market.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Dropped 1 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was reduced by one yuan because it was heard that the spot market was still weak. Datong Bank changed to 213 yuan, and Xin Bank was 211 yuan, taking in 205 yuan.</p>
<p>English Pure Gold Fell by Half a Penny</p>
<p>According to the London wire on the 5th, English pure gold fell by half a penny per ounce because the pound continued to be high, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 4 pence, and a half. This caused the Bank of China's spot purchase price to also fall to 1,211 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold remained the same at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price was also 3 jiao lower, at 1,206 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Futures: Supply Relatively Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's inter-bank exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar gradually increased, rising by 1.3 to 1.875. The number of settlements by foreign firms increased, and Chinese firms also bought more and sold less. In the local foreign exchange market, the British pound should have been tight and the US dollar loose, but because British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile still maintained the original price of 8 pence and 25 to supply British gold, and US banks were unwilling to release US dollars at a loose price, the spot prices of both the British pound and the US dollar tended to be consistent. Although futures were purchased by Chinese firms, foreign banks had a good willingness to supply, so the market was slightly firm. Trading was still strong in the morning and turned quiet in the afternoon. The Hong Kong exchange rate weakened slightly because foreign firms' willingness to sell was not strong.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the long-term and short-term London large strips were 0.0625 higher, the New York silver price was stagnant, and the London bullion price was reduced by half a penny. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was 1.3 higher, and the rate against Shanghai and France remained the same. The US dollar rose by 1.875 against the British pound, rose by 2 fen against Shanghai, and rose by 1.25 against France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 8 pence and 25 for the British pound and 16 yuan and 0.09375 for the US dollar, with no change compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, although the settlement by foreign firms was busy, the lack of change was due to banks were willing to sell. It is said that the foreign firms first settled HSBC spot British gold at 8 pence and 25, and then purchased Huabi spot US exchange at 16 yuan and 0.09375. When the HSBC list was announced without change, and the silver balance tax was announced at a large percentage of half a percentage, a tax of 5.00%, the foreign firms came again to settle Huabi July US exchange at 16 yuan. Later, Chinese firms also followed to buy Anda and Dutch August US exchange at 15 yuan and 0.9375. The market situation was stable and seemed slightly firm. Nearing noon, there was only Hong Kong exchange buying and selling. It is said that money exchange shops settled the foreign bank Dutch spot price at only 55 yuan and 125, which was slightly soft. The banks' noon closing spot selling prices for British and American exchange were the same as the morning opening prices. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55.5 yuan and 125.</p>
<p>The trading was suddenly scarce in the after-market. No transaction for the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar had been reported, and only some transactions for the July British pound had been made. It is said that the Chinese firms traded with each other, and the price sold by the Bombay Bank to the Orient was 8 pence and 0.21875, so the price had no gains or losses. Until the evening closing price, the banks' spot selling prices for British and American exchange were 8 pence and 25 and 16 yuan and 0.09375, respectively. The result was that the spot prices of British and American exchange were still the same as the previous evening's closing price, and the futures were stable and slightly firm. The Hong Kong exchange rate was softened by 0.125 after calculating according to the transaction price.</p>
<h3>Large Denomination Japanese Banknotes See Sudden Surge in Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar did not move. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms had a strong desire to settle, and the banks provided smooth supply. At the opening of the spot market, gold firms supplied, and the market was slightly soft. After entering the market, money exchange shops suddenly had a strong desire to buy, taking advantage of the low price to absorb, and the market price rose instead of falling, turning firm. In the afternoon, supply and demand were relatively scarce, and the situation was very stable. The result was that it rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous day. As for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds, supply and demand were evenly matched, and the market was stable. American gold pounds and British gold pounds rose slightly against each other. The trading of American gold tickets was very smooth, and they all tended to rise due to increased demand. There was strong demand for Hong Kong tickets, and the number of tickets tended to be tight, and the market price rose again. The supply and demand of French franc tickets was not strong, and the market was stable. The demand for Italian tickets recovered, and the price continued to be expensive. The supply and demand of Japanese currency was quite active, and the market price was low for small denominations and expensive for large denominations. Small denominations were 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan tickets, while large denominations were 50 yuan, 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan tickets. Usually, the market price is based on small denominations, and the difference between the prices of small and large denominations is only 1 fen or only 23 li. Yesterday, a certain foreign bank needed tens of thousands of yuan in large-denomination Japanese currency, so the money exchange shop filled the need by supplying small denominations to replace the large denominations. The difference between small and large denominations reached as high as 3 fen, which is impossible for those outside the industry to match. The price of Japanese gold tickets in the morning was 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 7 li. Later, because the supply tended to be strong, it dropped to 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 5 li. In the afternoon, it rebounded to 9 jiao and 2 fen. The price of Korean tickets in the morning was 8 jiao and 3 fen, which fell to 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li, and the result was 8 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li. The exchange transaction was very scarce. Only Zhenxing sold American gold tickets to Tongfeng for 800 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold tickets rose by 2 fen, American gold pounds rose by 1 jiao, American gold tickets rose by 2 li, Hong Kong tickets rose by 1 li, Italian tickets rose by 1 fen, and all other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains: New Wheat from Various Places is Being Sampled</h3>
<p>Since the first batch of new wheat was put on the market the day before yesterday, wheat samples from various places have been sent to Shanghai one after another. It is said that there are also new samples from the Wusong area nearby, and the quality is still good. It is also said that the second batch of new wheat from Chenmu has arrived in 40 odd bags, with a price of 5 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen. Because it is directly distributed to Japanese factories, it is not officially open to the market. According to the current situation, new wheat from various places is entering the market one after another, and it coincides with the arrival of ocean powder and old wheat ordered by Shanghai factories. It is difficult for the market to revive the old. It is predicted that the wheat market this year will rise after listing, because the environment is different from the past. As far as the current situation is concerned, there is no sign of improvement.</p>
<h3>Flour Arrives: 100,000 Bags of Foreign Flour, 60,000 Bags of Flour Exported</h3>
<p>The trend in the flour market continues to stabilize. Local transactions are not particularly active. The "Shirai" ship, scheduled to arrive on June 1st with imported foreign flour, has now arrived in Shanghai, totaling over 100,000 bags. Market inventory is again abundant. It is heard that the Bat Brand has dropped to $4.35, and mid-range brands are only selling for $4.30 on exchange. With the new wheat season upon us, future flour prices are expected to remain low. Therefore, wholesale sales, except for slightly cheaper foreign flour transactions, have seen little demand for factory flour. Factories, fearing further price drops, are hesitant to move stock, and No. 2 flour remains at $4.40 on exchange. The 30,000-plus bags traded by local customers are unlikely to see immediate market growth.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 7th, 22,100 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 5,000 bags to Yantai, 30,250 bags to Shantou, and 2,000 bags to Xiamen. Additionally, 300 bags of bran were shipped to Xiamen and 450 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Sales More Active; Foreign Rice Prices Lowered to Clear Stock</h3>
<p>Japonica Rice (Du Geng): Yesterday, various gangs delivered a total of 2,600-2,700 bags of Songjiang Gang No. 2, Cartwheel Baozi, and Kunli rice from river ports. The market remained stagnant with little change. However, the overcast and rainy weather slightly boosted confidence, and local sales showed some activity. Stockholders also engaged in some transactions. As a result, except for a slight increase in prices for lower quality rice, most rice prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Indica Rice (Ke Xian): Yesterday, local demand was strong, with total sales of over 3,000 bags, mostly for actual sales to shops and factories. Few stockholders inquired. Therefore, despite the weakening demand from Hangjia and other inland gangs, market prices actually rose by about $0.15. Inland gangs only traded about 1,000 bags, as inventories were not yet cleared after several days of strong sales, and inland prices had also returned to normal. Demand is likely to gradually decrease. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian are still selling actively, and the market is quite firm.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Large buyers are still absent, and warehouses are eager to clear stock due to the hot weather and approaching delivery of pre-ordered goods. The market is gradually softening. Yesterday, several dozen bags of Saigon rice were offered, and the price dropped another $0.10 to $18.80. Ling Yixing customers are still quoting $19.23, freight included.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Yesterday, the market for Biang Yuan rice was sluggish due to high prices and competition from foreign rice. The market showed signs of flatness and fatigue.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Jiading New Broad Beans; Tianjin Gang Most Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the new broad bean season. Besides a small amount of green broad beans, there was a significant influx of Jiading white broad beans. Although the Tianjin gang was actively buying, prices did not increase. Yesterday, over 900 bags of Jiading white broad beans were offered, with two-thirds bought by the Tianjin gang and the rest by local dealers. The price was $6.70, original price. The supply of new green broad beans was limited, so sellers held firm, with the highest price reaching $7.80, but only a dozen or so bags were sold. Total market sales yesterday were about 20 bags of Pailou Shi goods, priced at $7.40 to $7.50, and over 200 bags of Minhang goods, priced at $7.25 to $7.80. Besides local sales, several dozen bags were also bought by the Xiamen gang.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: New Rapeseed Oil Squeezing the Market; Raw Soybean Oil Holds Original Prices</h3>
<p>Soybean Cake Futures and Spot Prices Parallel</p>
<p>Raw Soybean Oil: The raw soybean oil market has not seen much excessive change in the past two days. Sellers are unwilling to lower prices due to high costs and low profits. However, sales in various markets have decreased due to the availability of new rapeseed oil and the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday, the market was in a sluggish state. Only 100 cans of Yantai canned peanut oil were traded at the original price of $10. There was no market for other soybean oils.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: The June futures are being delivered by Japanese firms. The market is stable due to manipulation by strong stockholders. Some small short-sellers are covering their positions, leading to active trading. Yesterday, over 10,000 pieces of Yuanji June futures were traded at $2.82 to $2.83, and 5,000 pieces of miscellaneous brands were traded at $2.75. Although spot sales are slow, the price of this month's futures is higher than the spot price. So, spot prices rose by $0.03 to $0.04 under the support of holders. 1,000 pieces of Yuanji cakes were traded at $2.80, and 1,500 pieces of miscellaneous brands were traded at $2.74 to $2.75. Currently, futures and spot prices are parallel.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Futures Rise; Lun Chang Muslin Supply Cut Off; Demand for Local Eastern Textiles Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Domestic Plain White Cotton Cloth: Fine twill has been selling well recently, and merchants' inventory is gradually being depleted. Factories have opened orders for over 1,000 bales of June-July futures, priced about $0.10 higher per piece than the market, causing the spot market to tighten. Shenxin Fugu fine cloth is selling at a $0.10 premium, and Dapeng's quoted price has also risen by $0.10. The Wenzhou gang continues to buy strongly, trading 100 bales of 12-pound and 11-pound fine cloth. Dyed twill is selling well, and dyeing factories are actively buying, with nearly 100 pieces traded yesterday, with prices rising by $0.10 to $0.20 per piece. Wholesalers transferred 300 bales of coarse cloth to the local street, which were absorbed and resold to Eastern Zhejiang and Wenzhou. Local stockholders and wholesale retailers purchased 50-60 pieces of various grades of light and heavy coarse cloth from factories. Dealers from Northern Jiangsu bought over ten pieces of 9-pound coarse cloth, and the market is stable. Dyed cloth for customers in Wenzhou gang continues to be strong. They purchased 50 cases of dyed cloth, dyed twill, serge, straight tribute, and printed fabrics. Some customers in the Shantou gang have stopped loading, while others are still shipping as much as possible. Buyers from Sichuan and Yunnan have newly increased purchases, mostly dyed twill, totaling 2,000 pieces. Dark colors are holding firm, while light colors are mainly sold by retail shops due to seasonal factors, making the market quite chaotic. However, Lun Chang's non-fading muslin, linen, and printed fabrics are in high demand at retail, with daily sales of 1,000-2,000 pieces. Supply has been cut off due to the strike. Popular patterns are out of stock, and wholesale retailers are barely able to cope with demand.</p>
<p>Local Eastern Plain White Cloth: The market rose further yesterday due to continued strong dyeing and sales in the local street. Fine cloth prices vary in the spot market, resulting in stabilization, while next month's futures have uniformly risen by $0.05 to $0.10 per piece. Demand for fine twill has increased sharply, with both spot and futures rising by $0.10 to $0.15 per piece. Dyeing factories and colored cloth dealers purchased a total of about 5,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and market sentiment is good with expectations of further price increases.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 7th, 85 pieces of textiles were exported to Tianjin, 15 pieces to Yantai, 14 pieces to Xiamen, 290 pieces to Shantou, 36 pieces to Hong Kong, 80 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 65 pieces to Beihai, and 95 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Falls Again</h3>
<p>According to Reuters telegrams, the sugar market fell slightly. Near term was down by one-eighth of a point, far term down by a quarter of a point. August futures were at 6 shillings and 9/8 points, December at 5 shillings and 9/8 points and 75, and March of next year at 6 shillings and 0.025. As a result, the Shanghai Sugar Guild's quoted prices fell again. Spot No. 24 refined white sugar fell by $0.20 at the local warehouse, trading at $26.50 for 50 bags. The outside warehouse fell by $0.30 to $26.20. Re-exported goods fell by $0.40 to $17.90, with 150 bags sold.

Dutch red sugar and Cartwheel red sugar were quoted at the original price with no transactions. According to news from Gulangyu, the price of domestically produced Diao Qing sugar has surged to $25 due to rising prices in Wenzhou. Previously, the price had dropped to $18 per bag. Most of the sugar is now being shipped there for sale. Yesterday, 100 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong and 88 bags from Shantou.</p>

<h3>Allegations of Flag Misuse: Japan Protests to the United States; Wording More Moderate than Protests to Britain and France; Expresses Deep Regret Over Bombing of American Property</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese authorities yesterday (5th) lodged a third protest with diplomatic and naval officials of third-party governments regarding alleged misuse of foreign flags by Chinese troops. According to a Japanese Navy spokesman, Counselor Morishima of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai delivered this protest to officials at the U.S. Embassy yesterday. Observers believe the wording of the protest appears more moderate than previous protests lodged with British and French authorities. It stated, in part, that the Japanese Naval Authorities</p>
<p>Regretfully Note</p>
<p>That since January of this year, Japanese naval aircraft have unfortunately repeatedly damaged American property, giving Americans the impression that the Japanese Navy disregards the property rights of third countries. In reality, the information provided by third-party authorities regarding the location of American property and all property of third countries, as well as other materials</p>
<p>Obtained Through Investigation</p>
<p>By the Japanese authorities, has been forwarded to the relevant air force units for detailed differentiation, and the location of third-party property is carefully studied before each attack to avoid accidental losses. It then listed various cases as evidence, concluding that, as can be seen, although Japanese naval aircraft attacks on Chinese troop positions are extremely careful, they inevitably cause</p>
<p>Accidental Damage</p>
<p>To nearby American and other third-party properties.</p>
<p>While the Japanese Naval Authorities are making every effort to respect American property, they would like to request that the U.S. authorities take appropriate and effective measures to prevent Chinese troops from building military positions and other military facilities near American property, and from using such property for military purposes.</p>
<h3>Admiral Noble Departs Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>British Far East Naval Commander Admiral Noble indeed left Shanghai for Hong Kong on his flagship HMS Birmingham yesterday afternoon. U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell is also scheduled to sail to North China tomorrow on his flagship USS Augusta. Admiral Yarnell's personal yacht, USS Isabel, will accompany him.</p>
<h3>Lun Chang Old Factory Resumes Work Yesterday Morning; Labor and Management Reach Understanding; Conspiracy Fails – One Worker Arrested by Japanese Troops –</h3>
<p>After the labor unrest at the British Lun Chang Spinning and Weaving Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, part of the workers at the Bailianjing Old Factory were instigated to strike. It is now learned that 600-700 male and female workers at the Old Factory, after sending representatives to negotiate with the factory, have reached a satisfactory resolution because both sides</p>
<p>Expressed Concessions</p>
<p>And agreed on the terms of resumption of work. All workers fully entered the factory yesterday morning and resumed work. However, it is said that the so-called "Alliance Society" sent people to try to prevent workers from going to work, but the workers ignored them and returned in despair. However, the</p>
<p>Lujiazui Factory</p>
<p>Labor unrest remains unresolved. The English-language North China Daily News reported that Ding Geller, an employee of the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, aged 475, was allegedly arrested by Japanese naval marines this morning (6th) for firing a shot at a Japanese Marine Corps captain in the area. The Japanese also allege that Ding threatened Major Noya of the Pudong Marine Corps and another Japanese naval officer with a pistol. Lun Chang personnel are</p>
<p>Investigating the Matter</p>
<p>As of press time, the shooting by Ding has not been confirmed. It is reported that Major Noya recently accused a Sikh sentinel of stabbing him with a bayonet. However, it is said that he had one hand on the bayonet at the time, and the sentinel naturally moved the bayonet away, resulting in a cut.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Commission: Water and Electricity Rate Resolutions; Water Rate Discount Cancellation Extended for Six Months; Electricity Rates Allowed to Include Surcharge but Subject to Review</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Council held its first meeting of the year on the 19th of last month. Commissioner McDonald was elected Chairman.</p>
<p>Water Rate Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the water rate issue of the Shanghai Waterworks Company, the meeting resolved to approve the Waterworks Company's proposal that the water rate schedule remain unchanged for the time being and that the current practice (i.e., cancellation of the 20% discount) be extended for six months, at which time it will be reconsidered. This resolution has been approved by the Council Board. It is noted that the Shanghai Waterworks Company's recent business situation has shown considerable development, and the actual results for the second half of last year were better than those forecast in September of the same year. According to the Waterworks Company's letter to the Council, the current price increase is justified, but out of consideration for the difficult times, it is willing to extend the current arrangements for six months.</p>
<p>Electricity Rate Issue</p>
<p>Also on the 26th of the same month, the Commission held its second meeting to discuss the electricity surcharge issue. It resolved to approve the Director of Finance's proposal to allow the Shanghai Power Company to continue to collect the surcharge, but this measure may be reconsidered at any time. The actual surcharge collected by the Company in the past five months was lower than that which should have been collected according to the original calculation method, but the loss was smaller due to the increase in electricity used by users. In recent years, the Company's net profit, based on capital, has been lower than the net profit that can be collected under the business contract, especially in 1937 and 1938. Since December of last year, the Company could have collected a surcharge of 37.34%, but it did not increase the percentage to stabilize prices. The Council Board approved the Public Utilities Commission's recommendations at its regular meeting on the 31st of last month.</p>

<h3>Methods to Circumvent the Embargo: Provincial Governments to Handle Based on Circumstances</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the times and circumvent the embargo, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a telegram to the provincial governments stating, "After repeated research by the Ministry, for items other than the grains, salt, metal materials, coal, gasoline, and alcohol listed in the embargo list, the transporting merchants shall provide a reliable guarantee, which shall be verified by the Ministry, and a transportation permit shall be issued. At the same time, the customs shall be notified to inspect and release the goods at any time. In view of the interruption of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, it would be difficult to respond appropriately if each matter must be consulted on a case-by-case basis. It is necessary to handle the matter flexibly. The provincial governments are permitted to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether to prohibit or transport goods based on the actual situation at any time, so that goods can circulate smoothly and the social economy can be flexible. This is an essential task for the economic war." It is reported that the governments of Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces have complied with the regulations and are handling the review matters at any time.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Return to Serve the Country: Two Batches of Overseas Chinese from Malaya and Kuala Lumpur Return Home</h3>
<p>China's war of resistance has lasted for more than a year. The military and civilians of the whole country are deeply convinced that the final victory will belong to us, and they are determined to resist the war. The government urgently needs technical mechanical talents, and overseas Chinese are returning to the country to serve the country. (1) Five hundred overseas Chinese machinists from Malaya returned to the country to serve and arrived in Saigon, Annam, on the Fengqing ship on the 22nd of last month, and then went to Kunming. This batch of overseas Chinese sacrificed their original professions to serve the country, which is commendable.

The Japanese troops are in a state of extreme panic from Hangzhou to Jiaxing, and trains are no longer running according to the scheduled times. It is rumored that Chinese troops have occupied the important strongholds of Zhapu, Pinghu, Haiyan, and Haining on the north bank of the Qiantang River. The situation in Hangzhou is more panic-stricken than before August 13th. People generally expect a major battle to be imminent.</p>
<h3>Two British Merchant Ships Depart from Hankou for Shanghai; Carrying Naval Personnel and Some British Nationals; Japanese Transport Ships Carrying Foreigners Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Yulin News reports that Jardine Matheson's SS Suiwo and Butterfield &amp; Swire's SS Wuhu sailed to Hankou last month carrying relief troops of the British Navy and civilian passengers. After arriving in Hankou, the SS Wuhu was intended to pick up the SS Wulin, which was trapped in the port. Yesterday (5th), the Japanese side announced to reporters that the SS Suiwo and SS Wulin, escorted by a British gunboat, had set sail from Hankou on Sunday, carrying naval personnel from the British gunboats in Hankou and some British civilian passengers and are sailing to Shanghai. A Japanese Navy spokesman said that 18 other third-party nationals, including 5 Americans, 2 Italians, 1 German, 1 French, and 9 White Russians, were traveling on two Japanese transport ships, which also departed from Hankou yesterday. The U.S. Consul in Hankou, Stephen, and the French Consul, Picot, were also among them.

<h3>Investigation into Domestically Produced Goods; Halt the Abuses of Impersonating Domestic Goods; Table Filled Every Six Months</h3>
<p>In order to protect domestic goods production and prevent the abuse of impersonating domestic goods, after issuing domestic goods certificates, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently been conducting more strict inspections to avoid mixing genuine and fake goods. It issued a special order to the provincial governments stating, "The Ministry's Rules for Issuing Domestic Goods Certificates were amended and promulgated in September of the 27th year of the Republic. However, the internal situation of the factories that have already received domestic goods certificates is constantly changing. If inspections are not carried out at any time, it will be difficult to verify the authenticity. The method of supervision is now determined as follows: (1) All factories that have received domestic goods certificates shall fill out a detailed table of matters once every six months and submit it to the Ministry for reference. The table format is the same as the table of matters to be provided when applying for a domestic goods certificate. (2) The completed table of matters shall be submitted to the local competent authorities for review and approval, or sent to a legally established industrial and commercial organization in the area for certification, before being submitted for approval. The certification procedures shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures for filling out and submitting the table of matters for application for a domestic goods certificate. Apart from instructing them separately, the Association is required to comply with and inform the Chinese factories that have received domestic goods certificates in various places to comply, fill out and submit the reports as required. This is hereby notified. Minister Weng Wenhao."</p>

<h3>Domestic Tea Approved for Shipment to Shanghai. Silk and Wheat Enter the Market in Succession. Abundant Spring Silkworm Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Blocked from Transport to Shanghai. First Batch of Wheat, One Hundred Bags, Arrives in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>Tea leaves, spring silkworms, and wheat from across the country are successively entering the market. Merchants are gathering capital to purchase them separately. Tea leaves, in addition to domestic sales, are being gathered for export from Hong Kong. Spring silkworms from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are being blocked from transport to Shanghai. The first batch of wheat has already arrived in Shanghai. Banks and firms are continuing to provide loans for tea, silkworms, and wheat, except in occupied areas. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tea</p>
<p>After the new tea from provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hubei entered the market this year, foreign firms, local firms, and raw tea merchants all borrowed money from banks and sent personnel to the producing areas to purchase tea. There was a bumper harvest of tea in Qimen, Wenzhou, Pingshui, Huizhou, and other places. However, except for tea for domestic sale by local firms and raw tea, which is allowed to be transported to Shanghai for sale, foreign firms' tea, including black tea, green tea, and tea bricks, is all prohibited from being transported to Shanghai and is concentrated for export from Hong Kong. Tea factories in various places have been rushing to produce tea, and since May, exports of Chinese tea have increased sharply, exceeding a value of ten million yuan in national currency. As for the tea collected by Fuhua Company, it is limited to tea from foreign firms, because the Trade Commission has signed tea sales contracts with the Soviet Union and other countries, designating Hong Kong as the export port.</p>
<p>Spring Silkworms</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are silkworm-producing regions. After the spring silkworms in various places entered the market, the cities were controlled and purchased by so-called "Central China Companies," while in the townships, manufacturers were allowed to purchase freely. Silkworm firms in various parts of Zhejiang have successively stopped weighing, and silkworm firms in Wuxi, Jiangsu, have already started weighing. However, manufacturers in Zhejiang who want to transport the silkworms they have acquired to the Shanghai concession area are being blocked by the Japanese. The manufacturers are currently negotiating with the Japanese. Silk factories in the concession originally planned to start production after the spring silkworms entered the market, but now they have been forced to postpone starting production because the new silkworms are being blocked from transport to Shanghai. Regarding the harvest of spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, improved varieties account for 80-90%, which can be considered a bumper harvest, while native varieties have a poor harvest. However, the total output of spring silkworms is higher than last year.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Wheat-producing areas in China are widespread throughout the country, with Shanghai historically being a gathering point. Now, wheat from various places is starting to enter the market. Sample wheat from the Yangtze River area has already arrived in Shanghai. Manufacturers and grain merchants have separately sent personnel to purchase wheat. The first batch of new wheat, about one hundred bags, transported from Pudong and other places, arrived in Shanghai, with an asking price of about five and a half yuan. It is reported that there is a bumper harvest in the Jiangbei area this year, with an estimated output of four million bags. Flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin and Fubu, are also preparing to purchase as much as possible, but with the principle of being suitable for flour milling. Foreign wheat previously ordered has already arrived in Shanghai one after another, totaling about two million metric tons. Now, because new wheat has entered the market, the import of foreign wheat has been stopped to prevent a large outflow of foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>French Concession Promotes Traffic Safety Campaign. Pedestrians Must Walk Within the White Line. New Traffic Regulations on Avenue Dubail.</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, to safeguard the safety of pedestrians, have specially ordered since yesterday the posting of red and green slogans in various important roads, cautioning pedestrians to be careful when walking. Also, at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Route des Soeurs, pedestrian lanes have been marked with white powder, and police have been stationed to advise pedestrians to follow the traffic light signals and walk within the white lines. Those who do not comply will be reprimanded. A notice has also been issued as follows: "In recent years, the population in the French Concession has greatly increased, and the number of cars, rickshaws, and pedestrians traveling on the roads has been increasing day by day. Unfortunately, traffic accidents have also been increasing. In 1938, 48 people died and 1,555 people were injured in traffic accidents. The number of accidents must be reduced urgently. To reduce the number of accidents, there is only one way: pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, coolies, carters, cyclists, and drivers must resolutely respect traffic regulations and obey the orders of traffic police. It is better to drive a little slower than to be the cause of an accident or the victim of an accident. Shanghai French Concession Police Department."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors Holds Farewell Reception for Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. High Praise for the Achievements of Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. Welcome to the New Secretary-General and Treasurer.</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the entire Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors and senior staff held a farewell reception at the Cathay Hotel for Secretary-General Fessenden and Treasurer Ford. Those who attended included former Chairman Arnold, former Director Marius, current directors (Chairman Fackling was unable to attend due to his departure from Shanghai), Secretary-General Philips, Deputy Secretary-General Corbitt, Hoetger, and Ishizuka, as well as the heads of various departments. During the reception, Deputy Chairman Keswick rose and delivered a speech, praising Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. At the same time, he extended a welcome to Mr. Philips, who also served as Secretary-General, and Mr. Moore, who was promoted to Treasurer. Former Chairman Arnold then gave a speech, expressing his respect for Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ford. The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel on the evening of the 5th to entertain the outgoing Secretary-General Fessenden and Treasurer Ford. A total of twenty-eight people, including the directors, attended the meeting. Chairman Fackling of the Municipal Council is now in Hong Kong, so Deputy Chairman Keswick presided over the meeting.

<p>A family banquet</p>
<p>He sincerely hoped that Ford would return to the Municipal Council in the future to help solve many difficult problems.

<h3>Japanese Prohibition of Customs Clearance Concerns the British Consulate. Carefully Considering Whether to Take Diplomatic Action, No News Yet. The US Consulate General Also Has No Comment on This Matter.</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that on the 5th, it was learned that personnel at the British Consulate in Shanghai are carefully considering the Japanese rule prohibiting foreign ships from sailing to nine ports along the Yangtze River and the Chinese coast. It is said that they have received a detailed report from British shipping companies regarding this situation, but it has not been predicted whether they will take diplomatic action against this rule. At the same time, a senior official at the US Consulate General stated that the US Consulate General has heard nothing about this rule other than what has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Chinese sources reported that this rule was promulgated by a senior Japanese customs official without consulting the Commissioners of Customs, but this statement has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>Japanese Attitude is Tough</p>
<p>Dakwang News Agency reported that the reporter has been visiting the Jianghai Customs authorities for days to inquire about the handling of this case. However, the customs security is tight, so it is very difficult to interview senior customs officials. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, they went to the Customs again and interviewed Western and Chinese customs officers. As a result, it was said that since accepting the request of the Japanese Navy authorities, the Japanese Tax Commissioner has implemented the regulations of the Japanese Navy. Although it has attracted the attention of various countries, the Japanese Tax Commissioner's attitude is very tough. Commissioner of Customs Luford is currently exchanging views with various parties and has decided to set up regulations in accordance with the Customs Ordinance to try to crack down on this notice so that the Customs administration will not be disrupted.</p>
<p>Temporarily Change the Place Name for Customs Clearance</p>
<p>In addition to waiting for the governments of the various countries to take action to resolve the matter, foreign shipping companies are temporarily clearing customs according to the place names changed by the Customs in order to take into account the environment and maintain shipping. However, ships still stop at ports not listed on the customs declaration to pick up passengers and load cargo as usual. German and Italian ships are also doing the same.</p>
<p>The Purpose is to Control</p>
<p>According to reports from foreign shipping circles, the Japanese attempt to control Yangtze River shipping has developed from the Jiangnan line to the Jiangbei line. Taking the Beisha line as an example, Haimen Qinglonggang has become a base for the Japanese Navy and is its "special established area." All cargo shipments to rice have long been monopolized by the Nissin Company. However, apart from Qinglonggang, the Japanese are unable to control other ports. Cargo traffic at various ports is frequent, and foreign ships operate regularly, with prosperous business. Therefore, the Japanese conspiracy to covet the control of the Beisha line shipping industry has been brewing for a long time. After foreign ships are only allowed to stop at Qinglonggang, the traffic to other ports will be blocked, and cargo transportation will inevitably be concentrated in one port for entry and exit. It is expected that after the first step of the Japanese plan is realized, the Nissin Company will add more ships to compete for shipping. The second step plan will be to imitate the methods of the Hupu Changyinsha and other ports on the Jiangnan line and implement "removal permits" and other procedures to hinder the business of foreign ships. As for the coastal area, because the Japanese forces have not yet extended, Japanese ships cannot sail there. Seeing foreign ships sailing back and forth without interruption, they are drooling with envy, but they are unwilling to openly squeeze out foreign shipping companies to avoid directly causing diplomatic incidents and have to resort to the Japanese Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs as a buffer. How can such base tactics hide the eyes and ears of the people of the world?</p>
<p>Niuzhuang Changed to Open to North China</p>
<p>The British Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang ship was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Fujian to Xiamen on the afternoon of the 6th, also calling at Wan, Xinghua, and Quanzhou. Now it is learned that due to the obstruction of the Shanghai Customs, the ship had to temporarily cancel its trip and is scheduled to open to Tianjin and Qingdao on the 8th. As for Funing, Sinyanggang, Haimen in Zhejiang, and other places in Jiangsu, it will also be difficult to resume navigation temporarily.</p>
<h3>Residents of Zhabei and Hongkou Refuse to Pay Exorbitant Taxes.</h3>
<p>The exorbitant taxes that have been levied in various places such as Zhabei, Hongkou, and Yangshupu, such as the establishment of factories, workshops, opening shops and businesses, and retaining burnt-out houses, all have to be registered with the "Pseudo-Social Bureau" and pay various registration fees and donations. Recently, the so-called household registration tax and seasonal tax have also been levied on residents engaged in the above-mentioned industries. There are many items. Most of the residents who have moved to Zhabei are because the rent in the concession is too expensive and all other expenses are too high, and they cannot maintain their lives. They are poor people who have no choice but to move, and some cannot even find food, so they all refuse to pay.</p>
<h3>Refugee Vocational Training Center Planned in the Nanshi Refugee Area.</h3>
<p>Gao Zhenxing, the principal of the Nanshi Refugee Area Children's School, because the school is facing environmental obstacles and it is difficult to continue opening, it has been two months. Although several negotiations have been made, there has been no effect. They have no choice but to give up the spirit of running education and shift to running a refugee vocational training center, located at No. 155, Fuyou Road, Mingguo Road, at the original school site. Technical personnel are hired to guide the refugees in learning skills. The organization preparation office has now started and is engaged in preparing everything. The matter is greatly related to the production of refugees, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide guidance at any time.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Expert Talks About the Prospects of Sino-US Tung Oil Trade. US Tung Oil Planting is Gradually Improving, But Production is Still Limited. In the Next Few Years, It Will Still Rely on Chinese Supply.</h3>
<p>Tung oil is a major commodity in China's export trade, and the trade volume between China and the United States is the largest. According to a certain expert who is familiar with the Sino-US tung oil trade issue, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the tung oil produced in China has been more difficult to export to the United States than usual due to transportation reasons. It is undeniable that as a result, when the war first broke out, the United States</p>
<p>Oil Prices Soared</p>
<p>As a result, the tung oil industry in the states along the Gulf of Mexico, such as Florida and Louisiana, tried to step up production. According to the early years of this century, the above-mentioned states began to plant tung trees and tried to operate the oil extraction industry for decades. To this day, although this oil industry has improved a lot, the production volume is still limited and cannot meet the large domestic demand. Therefore, in recent years, it still</p>
<p>Relies on China</p>
<p>And increases year by year, reaching its peak in 1937. It is estimated that in that year, the total amount of tung oil imported from China to the United States reached 175,000,000 pounds, while the amount produced domestically in the United States was the highest last year (1938), but it was only 4,000,000 pounds. The difference between supply and demand is indeed very large. Following this observation, it can be known that in the next few years, the</p>
<p>Tung Oil Market</p>
<p>Still needs to be purchased in large quantities from China, which is undoubtedly certain. As far as the American planting of tung trees is concerned, in the initial period, they did not know what kind of soil, tung tree variety, and climate humidity were suitable, so the losses were very large. In recent years, they have tried their best to research and have made great progress. The current oil price in the United States is completely dependent on the supply situation in China. In the past two years, due to the war, the oil price</p>
<p>Fluctuated Greatly</p>
<p>When the Japanese army occupied Shanghai in November 1937, the export of tung oil to the United States was interrupted for a time, and the US oil price soared to a huge amount of 22 cents per pound in US dollars. Later, because a large amount of tung oil was exported from Hong Kong, the oil price fell accordingly. Until about October last year, Guangzhou fell, and it rose back to 15 cents per pound. Since then, the oil price has fluctuated between 12 cents and 15 cents per pound. At present,</p>
<p>Chinese Tung Oil</p>
<p>The export has been changed to the Yunnan-Burma Road. The government actively encourages planting in the rear provinces and pays attention to refining to improve the quality. In short, the planting of tung in the United States is improving day by day. If China wants to maintain its original position, it should pay attention to improvement at any time.</p>
<h3>Three US Submarines Enter the Port for Defense.</h3>
<p>The three US submarines No. 36, No. 38, and No. 40, after leaving port together the other day, continuously entered the three US destroyers No. 211, No. 127, and No. 219 yesterday morning, and were berthed at the No. 33 and No. 34 floating pontoons outside the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Yangshupu.</p>
<h3>The Pseudo-Police Bureau of Nanshi Takes the Pretext of Demolishing Church Houses. Attempt to Sell the Remaining House Materials at a Discount. Was Stopped by the French Priest in Strong Terms.</h3>
<p>Most of the houses in Dongjiadu outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi are the property of Dongjiadu Catholic Church. After the Shanghai war, nearly five hundred buildings were destroyed by artillery fire, resulting in considerable losses. Recently, the pseudo-police sub-bureau of Nanshi, on the pretext of demolishing houses in various places in Nanshi and collecting bricks and tiles for sale, (investigated in May, the pseudo-city police bureau of Nanshi issued a notice stating that they were ordered to demolish the burned houses and sell the bricks and wood), but until this month, the pseudo-Nanshi District Public Office also issued a notice (allowing people to report the demolition of houses and the sale of bricks and tiles) because they were not allowed to share the profits. Seeing that the Catholic Church's remaining houses and walls had a large pile of bricks and tiles, they could not help but become jealous of the huge profits. Regardless of everything, they sent pseudo-police and ignorant workers to start working yesterday morning. Later, the French priest of the Catholic Church came out to stop them and refused in strong terms, because the property rights belong to the Catholic Church, and others should not move them without permission. Moreover, the remaining bricks and tiles can still be used to build new houses in the future. However, the pseudo-police were aggressive and limited the time to agree to their demolition of the bricks and tiles before leaving dejectedly. Later, the French priest stated that if there were no results, he would be forced to implement it and file a negotiation to maintain the Catholic Church's property rights.</p>

<h3>Although the Detained Portuguese Ships Were Allowed to Be Investigated, There Has Been No New Development in the Negotiations. Recovery of Freedom is Far Away. The "Viking" Ship Has Also Not Been Released.</h3>
<p>The foreign ships detained by Japanese warships in the Zhejiang and Fujian waters, such as the Italian "De Pind," the German "Golden Temple," the Norwegian "Baud," and the Portuguese "Livorno," have successively gained their freedom and are operating on their original routes as usual. However, more than ten ships detained, such as the Portuguese "Mita," "Hailong," "Libao," "Rudema," "Maritang," "Beitang," and "Rudatangjiao," although the Portuguese Consulate has continued to negotiate with the Japanese, and the Japanese Consulate has allowed investigations, there has still been no new development as of yesterday, and there is little hope of release. There were once rumors that the "Viking" ship, which operates the Shanghai-Xinghua line by the German "Henry Timken" firm, had been released, but as of yesterday, this had not been realized.</p>

<h3>Wu Song Market is Weak, Customs Sub-Card is Abnormally Busy, Strawberry Production is Quite Abundant.</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Wu Song, half of the houses in the whole town have been destroyed by artillery fire, and the rest have been demolished by the Japanese army due to the lack of fuel, causing the residents to suffer the pain of not being able to return. In addition, the Japanese army's inspection of passes in the military area is stricter than elsewhere, so residents dare not return home, and there is still no hope of market recovery. The people of Song who have fled outside have been waiting for nearly two years, and less than half of them have returned to Song because they cannot maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, except for dozens of shops selling daily necessities such as medical gardens, rice shops, and restaurants in the middle section of Songyu Road Street, the other streets are still a blank space, and business is very weak. After the customs sub-card Yasheng ship arrived in Song, it was berthed beside the wharf of the former Shidu Luntun on Waima Road. The shipowner is Japanese, and the deputy shipowner is Chinese. The ship has seven Japanese crew members and more than twenty Chinese crew members and sailors. Their duties are quite busy, including issuing certificates and registration books for entering and exiting civilian ships, printing and filling in shipside numbers, and collecting cargo taxes. However, there are very few cargo ships entering and exiting, only ice, fresh sand, gravel, firewood, Ningbo fishing boats, and local ships are not very common. However, many customs declaration firms have been opened. In addition to the original local firms, such as He Jinji, Xu Chengtai, and Sinsun, etc., there are more than a dozen, and Ningbo firms, such as Xia Senji and Penglai Public Office, etc., have four or five. There are also four new firms opened in Song by Shanghai firms: Gongji, Liyugong, Ankang, and Yu Yuxiang. Therefore, the competition in business is unusually fierce. Unscrupulous people use all kinds of despicable means, such as drilling and flattering, to establish connections. Villagers have changed from cultivating rice paddies to planting strawberries (commonly known as foreign plums), which are produced in large quantities and have already been marketed. Each load is sold for six yuan. There are two plum shops in Wu Song, Gongji opened by Zhou Lansheng and Xiangtai (also known as the Improved Foreign Firm) opened by Zhuang, which can collect hundreds of loads every day and transport them to Shanghai by truck for sale to make plum (western name for jam) sauce. It is said that these strawberries can be sold for more than twenty yuan per load in Shanghai, and the profits made by the distributors are very large. The production period of strawberries is more than one month. The two firms said that after the strawberries are harvested, water peaches can also be marketed.</p>

The previous reports have recorded the details. Now, the investigating Chinese and Western detectives, Sun Wenmu and Huishengsheng, and Detective Wu have found out that the suspect usually specializes in inducing and stealing the property of women, such as dancers and tour guides. Since</p>
<p>The Last Crime</p>
<p>After being imprisoned, he claimed that he had other cases in the French Concession after his release, and asked that after the verdict, he be handed over to the French Police Department for investigation and punishment. The girls of Xishan Tour Guide successively</p>
<p>Testified</p>
<p>About the situation of being defrauded and stolen. The court then questioned the defendant, who confessed his guilt. Therefore, Jiang Jianqiu was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for the crime of continuous theft as a recidivist, and three years of imprisonment for the crime of continuous fraud as a recidivist, with a total sentence of five years of imprisonment. The radio and other items were returned to Lu Meili, and the remaining stolen goods were redeemed by the owner at a price.

<h3>Chef of the International Hotel Beaten to Death. Vegetable Vendor Who Committed the Murder Arrested.</h3>
<p>Wang Xinfu, a 25-year-old Ningbo native, was a cook in the International Hotel at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road. At about 4:50 AM yesterday morning, Wang was carrying a vegetable basket and went to the vegetable market at the intersection of Beijing Road and Shilu Road to buy vegetables. Unexpectedly, he had an argument with a vegetable vendor over the weight and market price, and then they started fighting. However, there were many vendors, and when they saw this, they ganged up on Wang, causing Wang to be outnumbered and beaten to death on the spot by many vendors. By the time the nearby police officers heard the news and arrived, Wang had already died. They immediately arrested two vendors as the ringleaders and escorted them back to the police station for interrogation. At that time, the vendors were still roaring and causing trouble for the police officers. Fortunately, a large number of detectives also arrived and suppressed the vendors. The two vendors who had already been arrested were immediately escorted back to the police station for interrogation. The corpse was then sent to the morgue for examination in an ambulance.</p>
<h3>Rascal Celebrates Birthday, Indiscriminately Sends Invitations; Neighbor Unwilling to Give Gift, Consequently Beaten Severely by a Gang</h3>
<p>A local ruffian, by the name of Yu Dage, residing at No. 18, Fu Run Li, Guizhou Road, previously took the opportunity to celebrate a fake birthday at Ju An, sending out invitation cards indiscriminately to all acquaintances and strangers, hoping to collect money. A man from Zhenjiang, Hong Yonghai, although a neighbor residing at No. 16, Rong Shou Li, had no previous interaction with Yu. Yu still personally gave him an invitation, but Hong was unwilling to waste money on such meaningless social obligations, so he threw it away. When the date arrived, he did not send a gift or attend to congratulate, which infuriated Yu. On the 13th of the previous month, Yu led his accomplices, Shen Baohua, etc., to Hong's home to make trouble, severely beating Hong and his wife, Yang, causing injuries. Afterwards, Hong and his wife went to the forensic doctor's office to prove their injuries and filed a criminal lawsuit of assault against Yu and Shen with the First Special Court, requesting strict punishment according to law. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang summoned both parties and witnesses for interrogation and concluded the hearing, ordering the two defendants to each provide a shop guarantor to await review and judgment.</p>
<h3>Extortion of Illegal Fees Unsuccessful; Ruffians Destroy Guide Agency; Yu Zungen and Lu Xiaoli Each Sentenced to Detention</h3>
<p>Si Le Wo Guide Agency, located at No. 5, Lane 68, Shantou Road, is owned by Li Agen. Recently, some ruffians, Jin Gen and Lu Xiaoli, etc., attempted to extort illegal fees but were unsuccessful, harboring resentment in their hearts. At 1:20 PM the day before yesterday, Lu and Jin went to the agency under the pretext of visiting the guide girl, Yang Yuanyuan, and went straight into the guide girls' bedroom. The agency's employee, Yin Qiu, stepped forward to stop them, leading to a conflict. Lu and others then left. Soon after, they invited more than 20 thugs, each carrying hatchets, iron bars, wooden sticks, etc., and swarmed into the agency, implementing their "smash the guide agency" policy, chopping anything they saw and hitting anyone they encountered, causing great chaos. Afterwards, Yin Qiu escaped and reported to the Old Gate Police Station by telephone.

<h3>Russian Jewish Man; Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building</h3>
<p>A naturalized Russian Jew named Si Dai Lin Fan Te, Da Wei Te (transliteration), 43 years old this year, worked as a barber. He traveled to Shanghai alone, with no family or address, and was unemployed and idle. Recently, he suffered from a mental illness, which came and went.

<h3>Vienna Dance Hall Lawsuit; Defendant Acquitted</h3>
<p>The Vienna Dance Hall on Avenue Haig, Jing'an Temple Road, was previously opened by Chen Zhanxiong under the name of Chang Ji Company. Later, due to the inability to develop the business, it was leased to the former owner of the Cathay Dance Hall, Chi Zhenmin, the former manager of the Ciro's Dance Hall, Xu Weizhou, and the dance troupe leader Zhao Zhongdi, etc., under the name of Xing Ji Company. They renovated it extensively and continued the business, but ultimately it closed down due to poor business. In January of this year, a man named Pan Sanxing, introduced by Xu Weizhou, leased the Vienna Garden Dance Hall from Chi Zhenmin of Xing Ji Company, renaming it Ji Ji Company. He placed an advertisement declaring the lease of all assets of the Garden Dance Hall, with a lease price of 20,000 yuan, with 4,600 yuan paid in advance. Unexpectedly, after the advertisement was published, Chang Ji Company came out in opposition, pointing out that Chi Zhenmin not only had no right to lease the property, but that the lease of the premises had also expired. Pan Sanxing of Ji Ji Company, believing that Chi and the other two had committed fraud, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against Chi Zhenmin, Zhao Zhongdi, and Xu Weizhou with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing them of fraud. The defendants also hired lawyers Qian Zheng and Le Junwei to appear in court to defend them. Yesterday, Judge Dai announced that Chi, Zhao, and Xu were all acquitted.</p>

<h3>Extortion Case of Transportation Company Manager; Five Criminals Tried and Awaiting Judgment; One Criminal Admits Being Sent by Someone; Four Criminals Claim Ignorance of Extortion</h3>
<p>Chen Futian, manager of Chen Fuji Transportation Company at No. 17 Guangdong Road, resides at No. 225, Lane 686, New Zha Road. Recently, Chen suddenly received two threatening letters from gangsters, with a bullet attached. The letters were signed by the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Anti-Traitor Group," stating that Chen was making a large profit by transporting goods on behalf of a certain party and should raise 5,000 yuan in legal tender to supplement the group's expenses. The letters instructed Chen to contact them in the Jinjiang Guanle, etc.</p>
<p>Teahouses in the French Concession.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Chen did not report it to the police station. Instead, he instructed his son-in-law, Yang Chuting, to contact them along with Liu Zhaobang and Wang Zhen, etc. Due to the inability to agree on the amount, no deal was made. Chen, fearing for his safety, dared not stay at home and temporarily sought refuge in Room 425 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Wood Bridge. Unexpectedly, Chen's whereabouts were discovered by the gangsters, who sent someone to warn him again. Chen happened to be out at the time. One gangster wrote a note.</p>

They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao presided over the continued interrogation. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the case. Then, witness Yang Chuting, etc., testified to the two parties'</p>
<p>Meeting Circumstances.</p>
<p>When questioned, Xu Gongxia admitted to being sent by Liu and Zhu, who are still at large, and did not deny that he was responsible for the contact.

<h3>Suicide Case; Yang Lizhen Has Died</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday, at No. 327, Oriental Hotel, Yuchiangqing Road, a woman from Suzhou, Yang Lizhen (27 years old), for unknown reasons, suddenly committed suicide by ingesting opium.

<p>Wan Chen Sauce Garden Liquidation; Shareholders with Controlling Shares Embezzle Funds; Unauthorized Closure and Embezzlement; Trial Held Once Yesterday, Defendant Released on Bail</p>
<p>Wan Chen Medicine Garden, a well-known establishment located at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Lujiawan Road in the French Concession, is a partnership that has been in operation for more than 30 years. It also has branches at Damuqiao Road and Avenue Foch, each with a considerable history. Therefore, the business is not bad. Unexpectedly, on April 26 of this year, the store manager and shareholder Zhang Qiuhua (28 years old, from Haiyan) and shareholders Chu Wenhan, Chu Baojun, Chu Peisun, and Qiu Shiying, etc., without obtaining the consent of the other shareholders Li Yansun, Li Yongsheng, Li Runshen, and Li Jimin,</p>
<p>Unauthorizedly Closed the Business</p>
<p>and Li discovered that Zhang and others had committed embezzlement and theft. Therefore, he hired lawyer Wu Huatai as an agent and filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. It is alleged that the Wan Chen Medicine Garden and its branches were established by the plaintiffs and defendants and Zhu Rongtian, etc., as partners, and have been operating peacefully until now. Unexpectedly, recently, the defendants appointed accountant Fei Zuyi to represent them in liquidation and took over all the goods. The plaintiffs, claiming their shareholding rights, published an advertisement in opposition. On May 5, they saw Fei's advertisement representing the sale of the main store, so they published another advertisement declaring their objection. Unexpectedly, the defendants not only did not wake up, but also</p>
<p>Went Further</p>
<p>and sold all 600 jars of wine in the store on May 12 (worth several thousand yuan) privately. The plaintiffs were neither consulted beforehand nor informed afterwards. The defendants' actions constitute crimes under Articles 320 and 335 of the Criminal Law, so they are requested to be severely punished according to law and ordered to return the sold goods, etc. After the court received the complaint, Judge Wu summoned them for questioning yesterday. The plaintiffs Li Yansun, etc., stated the above details. When questioned, the defendants Zhang Qiuhua, etc., gave evasive answers and hired lawyers Li Wenjie and Bao Changdong to appear in court to defend them. After verifying the statements in court, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning and released the defendants on bail.</p>
<h3>Police Department; Inspecting Pedestrians</h3>

However, it is reported that nothing was found.</p>
<h3>Beauty Builds Large Sailboat; Crosses Pacific Ocean; Boat Built in Hong Kong, to be Completed Next Spring; Trial Voyage to Dutch East Indies Planned Before Crossing to America</h3>

<h3>Accountant of Nanjing Texas Oil Company; Arrested for Embezzling Public Funds; Wanted by the Former Capital Court; Recently Arrested and Ruled on Jurisdiction for Further Trial</h3>
<p>A local man named Jin Yushu (also known as Smith Jin) was employed as an accountant at the Nanjing branch of the Texas Oil Company. During his tenure, he continuously embezzled 10,000 to 20,000 yuan in public funds and disappeared without a trace. The Texas Oil Company reported the case to the Procuratorate of the Former Capital District Court, which issued a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>For Several Years</p>
<p>Jin's whereabouts were unknown. Until recently, detectives from the Old Gate Police Station arrested Jin and escorted him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen opened a criminal court to continue the trial. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that, after the postponement, the Texas Oil Company investigated and found that Jin Yushu had been continuously embezzling</p>
<p>Public Funds</p>
<p>from 1920 to April 24, 1936, totaling 24,350.30 yuan. After deducting 5,000 yuan that had already been returned by the defendant, 19,350.30 yuan was still owed. The police are now prosecuting him for embezzlement in the course of business under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The Texas Oil Company has prepared a detailed report of the audit in Chinese and Western languages. The defendant has</p>
<p>No Objection</p>
<p>to the report. However, the Texas Oil Company's head office is located in Shanghai, but the defendant's crime took place in Nanjing, and the plaintiff had previously filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Former Capital District Court, and the jurisdiction of that court is now occupied. Therefore, there may be a question of jurisdiction, which should be determined by the court ex officio. Judge Xiao, based on the Texas Oil Company's report,</p>
<p>Questioned the Defendant.</p>
<p>Jin answered that it was largely correct. Judge Xiao ruled that there was doubt as to the jurisdiction of this case and ordered an indefinite postponement, pending a request to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate jurisdiction for further review.</p>

<h3>Abuse of Maid Case; Zhao Diancheng Escorted to Court for Trial; Victim Sent to Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>Zhao Diancheng, a young man from Hubei, also known as Zhao Dianchen, is 22 years old this year. He studied at Jian'an University in Fujian Province. This time, due to the outbreak of the war of resistance in Fujian Province, Zhao left school to take refuge in Shanghai. He had a cousin, Tao Fenfei (42 years old, from Anhui), who works at the Central Bank. Tao's mistress, Ms. Xie, is 31 years old this year and lives at No. 131, Garden Square, Kim Shenfu Road. Zhao borrowed lodging at Tao's mistress, Ms. Xie's place. Tao has recently left Shanghai for business, and when Zhao lived at Tao's house, he abused Tao's 13-year-old Anhui maid,</p>
<p>Tian Zhaoxiang.</p>
<p>On the night of the 28th of last month, Tao and Ms. Xie went out for entertainment and ordered the maid Tian Zhaoxiang to guard the door and open it. Ms. Xie knocked on the door late at night. It was raining and because Zhaoxiang had fallen asleep on the stool, Ms. Xie was calling outside the door but there was no response and her clothes were wet. Then Zhao got up to open the door and Ms. Xie had some complaints. Zhao vented his anger on the maid, ordered her to get up, and beat her with a wooden stick, and stirred her tongue with fire tongs. On the night of the 30th, Zhao used paste to</p>
<p>Bind the Girl's Hands Backwards</p>
<p>and hung her on the ring of a suitcase. After one night, Tian, unable to bear Zhao's constant beating and abuse, reported to Wang Ada, the building manager of the lane, and requested assistance. Wang reported to the French Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Zhao, and brought the victim Tian Zhaoxiang to the case. The detective found that the girl was indeed injured and ordered her to be sent to Cihui Hospital for treatment. Zhao was escorted to the Second Special Court for trial, ordered to be detained for investigation, and ordered the victim to be examined for injuries, and the trial was postponed. Now it is learned that Tian, a forensic doctor,</p>
<p>Verified the Scars</p>
<p>Yesterday, Liao, the head of the criminal court of the Second Special Court, presided over a continued hearing in Criminal Court No. 1. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, prosecuted him for assault and elaborated on the case. Then, the victim recounted the experience of being attached to the injury. When questioned, Zhao Diancheng said that he was teaching the girl a lesson because she was disobedient. The court ruled that the trial would be postponed for ten days and the defendant would be returned to custody. The victim was still sent to Guangci Hospital to treat the scars.</p>

<h3>Expectations for Contributors to the Supplement</h3>
<p>— Shang Qing</p>
<p>We already know the importance of the editor's responsibility for a supplement. However, the establishment of a supplement cannot rely solely on the editor; it also requires contributors to provide articles. Furthermore, the editor's views are often influenced by contributors. Ultimately, the editor cannot act unilaterally and stubbornly. It is possible for a lone editor to single-handedly manage a supplement, or at most, to have two or three close friends who write for it, but this is abnormal and uncommon, and therefore not a good example to follow.</p>
<p>From this, it is evident that the importance of contributors to a supplement seems to surpass even that of the editor. Since I already have expectations for the editor, I cannot help but also have expectations for these contributors.</p>
<p>I hope they will choose the supplement they want to contribute to and not submit randomly. There are many supplements, and while their content and nature may be similar, there are also significant differences, or they may not align with your views, so you must pay attention. If you submit randomly and end up on the wrong path, especially if you submit to outdated, regressive, or even reactionary supplements, even if they publish your work and offer generous compensation, I don't think you would be happy! Furthermore, if you submit articles solely for the sake of compensation and only care about getting published, then I hope you will be careful with your pseudonym and not use the same one, so others cannot figure out what kind of writer you are.</p>
<p>I hope they will not follow behind others. If others are discussing topic A, do not also discuss topic A; if others are describing object B, do not also describe object B. Your subject matter should always be uniquely original and fresh, and you should not simply parrot others or write stale platitudes.</p>
<p>I believe that the universe is vast and human affairs are numerous, providing countless topics for writing and at my disposal. The saying "inexhaustible in supply" is an appropriate interpretation of this. As long as you are willing to pay attention at all times and in all places, and cultivate keen powers of observation, I guarantee you will find new and unique subject matter everywhere you look. (However, you must not be overly curious and get stuck in a dead end.)</p>
<p>I hope they will not cater to the editor's preferences. Contributors catering to the editor's preferences is probably the most common phenomenon. Some contributors do not seem to focus on improving the quality of their own writing but instead focus solely on researching the editor's tastes. This is wrong. As I said before, contributors can influence the editor's views. As long as your article is good, both in content and presentation, even if you have not catered to the editor's tastes, I believe a fair-minded and perceptive editor will not bury your efforts. At that time, you may even achieve overnight success. However, if the editor's views are indeed correct, contributors should not ignore them but should instead use various clever writing techniques to promote and enhance them.</p>
<p>I hope they will consider the environment. I say this naturally only applies to contributors on the current isolated island, because the isolated island environment is unique, and contributors need to be mindful. Otherwise, it will not only be futile but may also harm the newspaper. However, my intention in saying this is not so negative; on the contrary, I mean to say to consider it actively. We must not forget our current important task, resisting the war and building the nation. We must fulfill our responsibilities as writers, writing consistent articles on various topics and using various techniques to promote the movement of resisting the war and building the nation. I firmly believe that the pen of a writer is indeed omnipotent, and the oppression of a particularly harsh environment cannot prevent the emergence of particularly proactive articles!</p>
<p>In addition to these hopes, of course, I also hope that every contributor will not write trivial or accusatory texts, or any text that harms others without benefiting oneself, or even harms oneself. I think legitimate contributors are certainly well aware of these things, so there is no need for me to waste words.</p>
<p>However, my words above are addressed to an already mature contributor. By mature, I mean someone whose thoughts, insights, and writing skills are all above the average level. If I were to address an immature contributor—in other words, someone whose thoughts, insights, or writing skills are still very naive—I would have different expectations.</p>
<p>I hope such contributors will immediately stop submitting! I certainly understand their interest or their self-confidence. However, at a time when compatriots across the country are preoccupied with saving the nation, in my view, it is best for everyone to be able to use their strengths and directly devote themselves to the cause of national salvation. If you are not confident in your submissions, why waste your energy and resources? You can reserve your interests and self-confidence for after the victory, when the world is at peace, and slowly satisfy them then. As for some immature contributors who complain about their articles not being published, or blame fate and other people, accuse the editor of being blind or selfish, or repeatedly plead for their work to be published in the newspaper, I think this is especially undesirable. I hope that in addition to stopping immediately, they will also sincerely repent!</p>
<p>My expectations may make some contributors feel dissatisfied, saying that I am intentionally treating them unfairly. I hope they will recognize my sincerity: I have no other intention than to hope that they will have legitimate and outstanding development. Moreover, I myself am also a contributor, and I am using these expectations to encourage myself!</p>
<h3>Ribbon Shoes (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>—The Grandmother's Story—</p>
<p>"Hold on, hold on," the grandmother hurriedly stopped him. "I still have something to say to you: do you really think 'they' treat people well? Didn't you say before that you weren't necessarily treated well in 'their' place?"</p>
<p>"Before," Li Jingen sat down again, "I didn't think 'they' were good; since I was injured and 'they' treated me, I think they're good."</p>
<p>"You are truly muddle-headed! I'm just asking you: how did you get this injury?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>After this series of questions and answers, the grandmother explained that if "they" hadn't come, he wouldn't have been injured, and of course, he wouldn't need "their" treatment. "They" come, and we die, get injured, and those who don't die or get injured suffer a lot. "If they" didn't come, or came and left, never to return, we would have good days.</p>
<p>"Your words are very good," Li Jingen listened to the grandmother for a while, then nodded and said, "Why didn't I think of that earlier? How do you know so clearly?"</p>
<p>It's no wonder Li Jingen asked, because the grandmother is, after all, an old woman from the countryside. How would she know these things? After the grandmother told him everything, he suddenly realized and said, "Oh, so I fell for your trick and told you everything."</p>
<p>"You're wrong," the grandmother said with a smile, "you didn't fall for a trick; you did what you should have done. 'They' are the ones who were tricked, not you."</p>
<p>"Then what else do you want to know now?"</p>
<p>"Now, there's nothing I must know, but in the future, I will want to know some things that should be known."</p>
<p>She then pointed out a series of things she should know, that is, things he, Li Jingen, should report.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have news, tell Asen, and let Asen tell us, because you can't go far."</p>
<p>"Isn't that dangerous?" he hesitated.</p>
<p>"There is danger," the grandmother explained to him again, "but if it's done well, there won't be any danger. However, if you're afraid of danger and refuse to do it, then danger is destined to come to you and your family, think about it!" She said in a stern tone at the end.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>She told him that we have already noticed him, and have already noticed his family; she also told him that if no one is willing to contribute, everyone will be slaughtered and eliminated by "them" in the future...</p>
<p>"Even if you encounter danger over there with 'them,' we won't forget you. We will..." The grandmother said even more thoroughly.</p>
<p>"Okay, I will definitely listen to you!" Li Jingen patted his chest, making a final affirmation.</p>
<p>"Then I can go back tomorrow," the grandmother said happily, "do you have any letter to take back to your family?"</p>
<p>"No letter," Li Jingen stood up and said, "just say I'm doing well here." He stretched out his hand and said, "The shoes? Give them to me."</p>
<p>"I didn't bring them." The grandmother suppressed a laugh.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Your wife hasn't finished making them yet, understand?" The grandmother laughed.</p>
<p>"Understood, understood," Li Jingen also laughed. "Then I fell for your trick again."</p>
<p>As Li Jingen walked out the door, the grandmother suddenly grabbed him, pretending to be surprised and saying:</p>
<p>"What? Are you just leaving like that? You ate my beans, where's the money?"</p>
<p>"I didn't bring the money, understand?" Li Jingen was stunned for a moment, then also laughed.</p>
<p>Qian Asen heard this and also smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>Li Jingen limped away from them in an atmosphere of laughter.</p>

<h3>How to Renew the Spirit—Letting Go (6)</h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>Readers are probably already annoyed. How come the past five days have been about repentance and self-renewal? Are there no good aspects of our lives? Please do not misunderstand. Of course, we fully acknowledge that there are many, many admirable qualities in human nature, and at the same time, we cannot deny that there are still many areas that need to be developed. Before building, there must be some demolition work. Before a mansion is built, the old house must first be torn down, and many wooden and steel piles must be driven into the good soil.</p>
<p>We have now reflected on the past, and we must feel very sorry for having had so many spiritual or moral shortcomings. What should we do after reflecting? Should we send all these shortcomings into the "subconscious" and forget them? Psychologists tell us that doing so is very unhealthy and can cause various psychological disorders. The best way is to deal with them with a spirit of great courage. This coincides with Jesus' teachings. We should not only repent before God, but also clearly recognize all aspects of the relationship. After all this, you can truly let go of them and receive new life.</p>

<h3>After Translating "The Patriot"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>I have been a reader of Pearl S. Buck's works for a long time. I am often amazed that a foreign writer can observe our Chinese customs and manners so carefully and describe them so realistically. Even though there are still exaggerations and inevitable errors in her works, I believe that we should not be too demanding of a foreign writer. Since she won the Nobel Prize for Literature, I have been even more pleased with her success. Although there has been some criticism and surprise at Pearl S. Buck's Nobel Prize, I believe that the awarding of the prize is not a trivial matter; there must be achievements and reasons for her to deserve the prize, which we cannot doubt. Now I am even happier that I have become the translator of Pearl S. Buck's new book "The Patriot."</p>
<p>My motivation for translating "The Patriot" was extremely simple. One day, I found a copy of Pearl S. Buck's new book "The Patriot" in a Western bookstore. I briefly read the description printed on the book jacket and learned that it was a work depicting the trends in China during this era. Without asking whether it was good or bad, I immediately bought it back. I spent several evenings reading "The Patriot" from beginning to end and found it very moving; however, I had no intention of translating it into Chinese at the time. Firstly, because I was translating André Malraux's "Man's Hope" and had no time to translate another book; secondly, because I knew that such a good book would definitely be translated by someone, and there seemed to be no need to join in the fun. However, I ended up joining in the fun and starting the translation entirely due to the encouragement of several friends. One evening, I was having dinner with Mr. Ba Jin somewhere, and we talked about Pearl S. Buck's new book. I only expressed that such a famous work should be introduced to Chinese readers; and he immediately said that the task of translating and introducing it should be undertaken by me. Later, several other friends talked about it, and they all encouraged me to immediately start translating this new book. So, I "started work" on a long novel of more than 200,000 words, and it actually began to be translated into Chinese in my cramped room. Once I started, the progress was quite surprising. Utilizing my spare time every day, I translated quite a bit. Then, several bookstores contacted me, willing to accept the publication. Among these bookstores, I chose Wanye. My friends Tang Qifeng and Feng Xun were also interested in translating the book, but seeing that I was busy, they came to help me co-translate it. I am grateful to them; with their cooperation, this translation will be presented to the readers today.</p>
<p>The theme of "The Patriot" is extremely novel; it not only depicts the situation after the Northern Expedition but also depicts the dynamics after the War of Resistance Against Japan; it not only depicts the arduous struggle of China but also depicts the perfidious intentions of Japan. The story of "The Patriot" is also extremely complex; it not only depicts the raging revolution but also depicts the touching love; it not only depicts the disputes in Chinese families but also depicts the discipline in the Japanese army. And the characters in "The Patriot" are extremely broad; there are wealthy merchants, there are impoverished workers and peasants; there are disillusioned generals, there are revolutionary young masters; there are heroic fighters, there are shameless traitors; there are insightful maids, there are boring scholars; there are Japanese merchants, there are German ladies; there are White Russian drivers, there are American pilots... And what surprises us the most is that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is also one of the characters in the book; his words and deeds are directly described in the story; writing the Chairman as a character in a novel, I think this is probably the first time.</p>
<p>I think it is still up to the readers to criticize the quality of the original work. However, in terms of translation, I have always advocated following the original work as much as possible, but also making it as understandable as possible for Chinese readers (note, our readers are all Chinese!). No matter how great the original work is, if it is translated into Chinese that even Chinese readers cannot understand, I believe that the greatness of the original work will still not be revealed; on the contrary, that is such an insult to the author of the original work! However, limited by personal knowledge, there are inevitably inappropriate places; and once the printing process is completed, mistakes are inevitable, which is something I should apologize to the original author and the readers for.</p>
<p>Thank you to Mr. Feng Zikai, because he agreed to make paintings for our translation. I also thank the readers, if they can point out and criticize. (Auction Donation)</p>

<h3>Air Force Warrior Fu Baolu</h3>
<p>— Wen Xia</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, he worked at Hongqiao Airport. He starred in the movie "Sea Burial" during the National Games.</p>
<p>When the banner of the War of Resistance shone with an unusual light on China's five-thousand-year-old soil, young people with hot blood from all provinces and regions shouldered their rifles, braved the artillery fire, and marched to the front lines.</p>
<p>The songs of the War of Resistance resounded through every desolate village, and rusty rifles and bayonets were polished to a shine, flashing with fire.</p>
<p>At this time, people from all levels of society, men and women, enlisted in the military, especially intellectuals, who threw away their textbooks and rushed to the army.</p>
<p>In the sports world, many famous athletes, such as "Little Black Coal" Chen Zhenhe, pole vault king Fu Baolu, and Wang He, who won second place in the National Games pole vault, joined the Chinese Air Force to serve the country.</p>
<p>The joining of these famous athletes to the Air Force not only shows that outstanding members of the Chinese people are participating in the War of Resistance, but also shows that they are not only "sports stars" but also the most combat-capable members participating in the national War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported the sad news of Fu Baolu's death in the air battle in Guilin. We hope that this unfortunate news is just a rumor. Now let me tell readers a little about the daily life of this Air Force warrior.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu: Born with a head of brown curly hair, a thin face that appears very energetic, a small mustache on his lips, not very tall, but very strong.</p>
<p>His personality is very irritable, but unusually straightforward.</p>
<p>He grew up in Harbin. His father was from Northeast China, and his mother was Russian. His family also includes a younger brother and two younger sisters. Now his whole family is in Shanghai, running a ginseng store on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Because of this, Fu Baolu not only speaks fluent Russian but also speaks fluent English.</p>
<p>If you don't know Fu Baolu's background, you will find a foreign flavor in him. Maybe you will guess that he is not Chinese. However, among friends or on the street, if someone carelessly says that he is Russian, he will get angry immediately and even resort to violence, or at least argue with you to make it clear that he is a Chinese from Harbin.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu likes to drink. After drinking, he is sometimes very rude, but his heart is very kind. Before the war, he worked at Hongqiao Airport. One day, he got drunk and drove a car, taking Jin Yan and many other friends, and drove to Hongqiao Airport at a speed of fifty or sixty miles per hour. On the way, he almost collided with another truck, scaring everyone in the car to almost scream.</p>
<p>He once married a very beautiful Russian wife, but later the two separated. He often thinks of his foreign wife when he gets drunk, shedding tears nervously. When he wakes up, his friends shame him.</p>
<p>During the National Games, Wang He wanted to compete with Fu Baolu for the top spot in the pole vault. That night, Wang He tossed and turned, unable to sleep. (He once returned to Shanghai, and is now back in the Air Force.) But Fu Baolu still won the top spot the next day. In fact, Fu Baolu didn't practice very hard. Some people say that if Fu Baolu could work a little harder, he wouldn't have been "unnamed" in the World Games.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu also tasted the flavor of movies. At that time, Wang Bin was at Tianyi Film Company and wrote a script called "Sea Burial," and decided to invite Fu to star in it, along with Liu Liying and others.</p>
<p>At that time, Fu Baolu was indeed very busy. During the day, he attended the National Games, and at night, he filmed "Sea Burial." Later, this film was screened at the New Guangda Theater before the National Games even ended.</p>
<p>After the Chinese army withdrew westward, he left Shanghai. Unexpectedly, such unexpected bad news came. We can only wish that this Air Force warrior is still safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Pigeon Diseases and Their Treatment</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wende</p>
<p>Pigeon Pox</p>
<p>(Infectious disease) Initially, small lumps appear, gradually swelling up like warts. Quickly cut off the affected area from the root, apply carbolic acid water, and then apply ointment.</p>
<p>Wasting Disease</p>
<p>(Infectious disease) This disease is only seen when pigeons suddenly become thin. After three or four days, they are completely unable to fly. When you see this, you should quickly isolate the sick pigeon from the healthy pigeons and give it garlic juice to drink.</p>
<p>Thirst Disease</p>
<p>Drinking dirty water and bad food can be treated by giving them very strong chili water to drink.</p>
<p>Wing Injury</p>
<p>When two pigeons fight, and their wings are injured, iodine can be applied. There are two types of lice: long lice and round lice. The former hide on the wings, and the latter live on the pigeon's neck. Insecticide powder can be sprinkled on them twice a day without interruption. If there are also traces of lice in the pigeon loft, kerosene can be used to kill them, and then a layer of white lime can be spread.</p>
<p>Cholera</p>
<p>If a pigeon is infected with this disease, there is a risk that the entire flock will be wiped out in a short time. Hold the pigeon's head down and its body up, and gently press the crop with both hands, so that water flows out of its mouth. Quickly isolate it from other pigeons, and mix cod liver oil with wood oil to form a medicine, and pour it into its mouth. Carbolic acid and tincture of gentian can be added to the drinking water of other pigeons.</p>
<p>Hatching Young Pigeons</p>
<p>After the male and female pigeons are paired, when the laying period is approaching, the male and female pigeons work together to pick up rice straws and feathers. It is best for the pigeon keeper to add tobacco stalks and stems to prevent parasites. Before laying eggs, the female pigeon is mentally depressed, her feathers droop, and she appears to be sick. She stays in the nest. After three days, she lays the first egg. The male and female pigeons then take turns incubating the eggs. One day later, she lays the second egg. After that, from morning to 3 pm, the male pigeon incubates the eggs, and from 3 pm to evening, the female pigeon incubates the eggs. After 17 days of incubation, the chicks break out of the eggs. After a week, their feathers are fully grown, and after a month, they can leave the nest to find food and fly.</p>
<p>Homing Pigeon Training</p>
<p>To make pigeons into messengers and communicators, they must be trained. First, make the pigeons familiar with the pigeon loft, and use a signal when feeding them, such as blowing a whistle, whistling, or calling the pigeons into the room, and feeding them delicious food and clean water, to develop the habit of recognizing the pigeon loft. The next morning, let the whole flock of pigeons try to fly for ten minutes, once in the morning and once in the evening, gradually increasing the time. Then, train young pigeons, one-year-old pigeons, two-year-old pigeons, three-year-old pigeons, and experienced old pigeons over four years old separately. After the flying method is pure and hot, take them to a place near the pigeon loft and release them one by one to return. Then, gradually increase the distance between the pigeon loft and the release point, and gradually eliminate inferior pigeons. Pigeon release methods can be divided into: individual release, sequential release, and simultaneous release. Individual release means releasing one pigeon at a time, and releasing the second pigeon after the released pigeon is out of sight. Sequential release means releasing the first pigeon while the previously released pigeon is still in sight. Simultaneous release means releasing all the pigeons in the cage at the same time. Before 1937, the Nanshi Confucius Temple Zoo also had a homing pigeon association. Every month, the homing pigeons of each member were taken to Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing and other places for competitions. The excellent ones were champions and could receive banners and certificates from government officials.</p>
<p>Releasing Pigeons</p>
<p>Bad weather such as rain, snow, strong wind, and heavy fog will severely affect the flying direction. Regardless of the length of the flight, they should be given sufficient water to drink. (The end)</p>
<h3>A Record of Guan Liang</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>——Overture to Guan Liang's Art Exhibition——</p>
<p>When Guan Liang is mentioned, an impression immediately arises in my mind: he is a man of few words, calm, and possesses the style of a pure artist.</p>
<p>Indeed, Guan Liang is also a cultivating gardener in the field of Chinese new art. He is a senior Western-style painter who studied painting in Japan very early on. After returning to China, he successively served as a professor in art schools in Shanghai, Wuchang, Guangzhou, and other places. His paintings have always advocated the integration of Chinese style. Because merely imitating some Western techniques, applying some Western materials, and even adopting subject matter commonly used in Western paintings, although able to grasp the sense of space, the soul of plastic arts, it is, after all, not one's own thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, Guan's paintings possess a free and refined style, while also being filled with the charm akin to literati paintings, that subtle tone, elegant and light colors, that unrestrained brushwork, often employing oriental themes, sparsely and effortlessly expressed. This kind of expression integrates the techniques of Shi Tao and Bada Shanren. This purely Chinese artistic style, in the Chinese art scene where there are either conservative and stale academic styles or imitations of the styles of certain paintings or the brushwork of certain individuals, is indeed extremely fresh.</p>
<p>If we carefully observe the evolution of Guan's style, his early works were naturally greatly influenced by Cezanne. This is a common phenomenon among modern writers, so his expression is very solid and calm, without any emptiness or superficiality. The texture, scenic impression, and sense of space of the object are, of course, sure to be grasped. At the same time, Renoir, known for depicting gorgeous and charming bodies, also had a significant influence on him.</p>
<p>In recent years, he has not been complacent and stagnated within a narrow scope. He still constantly devotes himself to creation, tirelessly seeking influences for the advancement of his art. Therefore, Guan's works, in terms of area, are not very large, the colors tend to be calm and serene, the themes are just some landscapes, figures, still lifes, the composition is not grand, and the brushstrokes are not bold, but he can express a light melody from ordinary and simple objects, capture the emotions hidden within nature, and from low houses, small trees, slanted telephone poles, flowers, fruits, girls' faces... express a latent and rich poetic meaning. This poetic meaning is not literary, nor is it a kind of poetic meaning caused by the requirements of philosophy or social science and other subjects.</p>
<p>Note: Guan's art exhibition is scheduled to be held from the 8th to the 11th of this month in the Grand New Company.</p>
<h3>The Concubine Greets</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw in the newspaper that someone named Chen from the Jingwei faction went to Beiping to smooth things over with the Wang Kemin puppet organization. Also, the day before yesterday, the newspaper reported that Wang Kemin of the Beiping puppet organization and Liang Hongzhi of the Nanjing puppet organization opposed a certain movement by Mr. Wang, etc. In that case, it is indeed appropriate for Wang Jingwei to send his trusted henchmen to greet everyone.</p>
<p>Anyone who becomes someone's concubine must first greet others. The first concubine must greet the first wife; the second concubine must greet the first concubine; the third and fourth concubines must greet the first and second concubines. Because those who enter the temple gate first are considered greater by three days. Otherwise, I will either give you the cold shoulder or give you a hard time. Not being jealous is not becoming of a concubine. A concubine's jealousy is the true nature of a concubine.</p>
<p>Wang came from a famous family and is now old, but she is acting as someone else's concubine, greeting a bunch of demons and monsters. Wang looks at herself in the mirror, how does she feel? Looking back on those years, what are her thoughts?</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Recognizing Hometown Acquaintances, the Old Life of Pestle and Mortar; Attaching to Power, the New Aristocracy of Official Hats and Sashes</p>
<p>These two conditions were what her father, Rong Peiying, had been considering all night and would decide on tomorrow morning. Poor Pan Peiying cried all night, racking her brains and realizing that she had to obey the first condition. Because if she didn't, Zhao Letian's life would be in danger. Her father meant what he said and would do what he said. He could really notify the military police and send a few military police to arrest him and shoot him. People would just think he had disappeared and wouldn't even know. Moreover, we are clearly irreconcilable with him. Could he marry the daughter of a _? Even if he was willing, people wouldn't agree to it. Our family would never allow a guerrilla fighter to be our son-in-law. There isn't just one person in this puppet government, and they are constantly fighting each other. At the very least, they would say that you are connected to the guerrillas. Can you bear that accusation? However, Peiying thought: I should write this reply a little more gently. In his letter, he told me to persuade my father. I can tell him in detail that I can't persuade my father. In his letter, he wanted me to leave my family. I can tell him that I can't leave now. But this letter of mine will definitely be checked by my father before it can be sent out. I definitely can't write a lot of rambling nonsense; nor can I tell him all my difficulties. I can only briefly reply to him for now according to my father's wishes, and then think of a way later. The first thing is to save his life, and not sacrifice it in vain. If I cling to him to death, it will only end up harming him, which is something that people will regret. Therefore, this letter of hers had no _ intention, but it did have a sense of resolution. She simply said: We now have different goals, so you don't need to write any more letters, which would be too verbose. Even if Ran has letters, I won't reply to them. Peiying thought that if Zhao Letian was a smart person, he would definitely be able to guess that I was not a free person. Because these words, at first glance, are not what I usually say. Then, wouldn't he understand after reading this letter? I can write to her again in the future, explaining that the letter I wrote last time was not of my own volition, but was written under duress. Moreover, I can also tell him that at that time, it was a matter of life and death. They already knew your address and could send military police to arrest you, so I had no choice but to write this letter. Therefore, Peiying deliberately wrote this letter in an extremely cold manner, which was completely different from the tone she used to use when corresponding with Zhao Letian. This letter would naturally be checked by her father before it could be sent out. Her father was very satisfied when he saw that she had written it in a very cold and decisive manner. He said that she had come to her senses and that it was not worth it to associate with these young people. But he was also secretly wary, afraid that she would correspond with Zhao Letian again, so he blocked their communication line. (130)</p>

<h3>Concerning the Startling Theatrical News</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>Since this column published the startling theatrical news from the Mei Hua Guan host, I believe the entire isolated island must be greatly stirred. Just taking the hundred or so colleagues at my place as an example, because I am relatively close to the theatrical world, they have all been asking me to find out if it is true or false, preparing to send congratulatory gifts. Previously, Mr. Zhang Shankun's father's birthday performance was a huge lie on April Fool's Day, causing thousands of theater fans to rejoice in vain. However, the host never likes to joke, and besides, yesterday, June 6th, was Teacher's Day, which could also be considered a foreign dog bathing festival. It doesn't seem like there are any regulations allowing lying, so I couldn't help but call the host. As a result, he seriously replied that I am not talking nonsense and guaranteed that the check would be cashed. With such a definite guarantee from him, I am indeed a bit greedy for this astounding check.</p>
<p>However, I am still a bit skeptical. Based on my observations, first, I can decide that Shuyan will not come. The simplest reason is that if he comes, he will be letting down several famous people in Shanghai who previously invited him and were rejected. Second, Lanfang will definitely not come either, because once he comes, it will be difficult to get rid of the feeling of "becoming Feng Fu again." Third, according to someone familiar with the Feng family's background, the Feng family's third daughter's given name is not Biqi. This Biqi is actually the nickname of Feng Sixth Master's concubine. Anyone who knows Sixth Master calls her Bishi because of this. Because of these points, I would like to ask the Shanghai Zhou Lang to not congratulate too early. It is better to believe that it is not true than to believe that it is true. If it really comes true by the deadline, wouldn't that be a pleasant surprise?</p>
<p>No matter what, just reciting this playbill three or four times is already quenching my thirst by looking at plums, enough to be considered chewing when passing a butcher's shop.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) What Ti Gong said is indeed correct. Yesterday, the number of phone calls from the outside world asking about the truth was truly overwhelming, which shows how excited the Shanghai opera world is. As far as I know, this show is being actively prepared. The general director in charge of rehearsals is a well-known amateur opera enthusiast in Shanghai. He originally wanted to postpone the announcement, but we disclosed it first, so it's no wonder everyone is so surprised. As for the three-day program and actors, I dare say it won't be that far off. The magazine will continue to report on future developments truthfully. Please pay attention, readers.</p>
<h3>The New Movement of Movie Stars in Movie City</h3>
<p>— Feng Xiang</p>
<p>Chest Enlargement and Hip Enhancement—Fashionable for a Time</p>
<p>—An Unconventional Fitness Method</p>
<p>Hollywood beauty expert Jim Davise has recently invented exercises for chest enlargement and hip enhancement. These two exercises are currently fashionable among Hollywood female stars. Dorothy Lemour and Janet Waldo are among the most enthusiastic participants.</p>
<p>According to Davise's secret, the movement to develop the chest is very simple. Whether you are sitting or standing while practicing, just raise your arms and bend your elbows, placing your wrists one foot in front of your chest. When gently touching each other with your fingers, you should feel your pectoral muscles expanding. Doing this, 40 times a minute for two minutes a day, according to Davise's experiments, if you continue to do it without interruption, your chest will develop after two months, because the development of the pectoral muscles can support the height of the breasts.</p>
<p>As for the wonderful method of hip enhancement, Davise also has a secret, with instructions as follows: Hang a rope from the ceiling so that the end of the rope is 18 inches above the ground. If you think this is too much trouble, you can use a chair with a back to replace it. Preparation posture: first lie down on your back, hold the rope or the back of the chair with both hands, raise your head and neck, and also raise your feet together, making the head and feet about six inches above the ground, with the center of gravity concentrated on the buttocks. Once this preparation is complete, you can begin the movement: first try your best to turn your feet to the left, and then turn to the left again, moving back and forth. Do it ten times on the first day, twelve times on the second day, and so on, until you can turn it 50 times a day, then stop increasing the number of times. After three months, a full effect of hip enhancement will naturally be achieved.</p>

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Family Misfortunes Abound, Ju Peng Follows in Da Tou's Footsteps and Enters the Priesthood</p>
<p>Strangely enough, not only did she not feel pain, but she laughed, scolded, and cursed, hitting anyone she saw, and didn't stop for two days and two nights. When Ju Peng saw his eldest daughter in this state, he realized that she had suffered a great deal of stimulation on her nerves, so he had to send her to a mental hospital. He also heard people say that the house was unclean and had evil spirits, so he believed it and moved with his other three children to the Litong Hotel in Dongjiaomin Lane. He stayed there for a long time, and each day, including food and lodging, cost him ten yuan. At the same time, the hospital also needed money. This went on for more than a month, and the eldest daughter's illness was only fully recovered. The whole family moved back home. Ju Peng had already lost a lot of money to form a troupe. Coupled with these unexpected expenses, the total was nearly a thousand yuan, and almost all of the funds were used up. The loss of money was secondary. What made him feel most aggrieved was that he considered himself a successor of the Tan school, but his son Shaopeng insisted on studying Ma Lianliang to death. Whenever he had a play, Shaopeng refused to listen. As long as Lianliang had a play, he was willing to pay to buy seats in the first two or three rows to enjoy the play. After the play was over, he would go home and imitate and practice Ma's singing style and performance style. Ju Peng was so angry when he saw this situation. One day, I was chatting with him, and he sighed and said: "Yan Ju Peng's son insists on studying Ma Lianliang. He doesn't want to learn from me, a real Tan school laosheng, and he insists on learning from these juniors. Isn't that strange!" After listening to his words, I tried to comfort him: "You must know that young people generally have a concept of loving beauty. Everything should be beautiful. Lianliang's popularity lies in the word beautiful. Who is like you, with a sparse and short beard and broken and old costumes? The white arrow shirt in "Lianyingzhai" is soaked in sweat, red in one area and purple in another, but you still wear it on stage. In your opinion, I am learning from the old Tan. The former boss Tan valued art over costumes." (30)</p>

<h3>Renji Medical Clinic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Renji Medical Clinic uses Western methods to treat Chinese people. This clinic has been operating widely for a year. According to statistics, last year, 516 patients stayed in the clinic, and 12,378 people went to the clinic to obtain medicine. In addition, a separate bureau was set up in the city for vaccination. Last year, 2,558 children went to the bureau, which is more than in previous years. But what is regrettable is that the Chinese people do not believe in this method, and those who believe in planting large flowers are still a large group. This clinic is well-known at home and abroad, and it has been for more than a day. The various patients who are treated come from far away in the inland, and some have taken Chinese medicine without recovery. Recently, the number of patients has been increasing, and the hospital buildings are narrow. It is planned to rebuild a new hospital on the old site, so that it can accommodate everyone. So far, a total of 3,108 taels of silver have been donated for this project. Magistrate Zeng donated 100 taels, Baogzhuang Guild donated 500 taels, Tea Guild donated 300 taels, Yangbu Guild donated 200 taels; and one anonymous person, because his relative's illness was cured by the clinic, donated 250 yuan in foreign currency. The director of the clinic is a doctor named Ya Gu, and his assistant is a Chinese gentleman named Huang; there is also a Western doctor named Han, who also helps with treatment from time to time.</p>
<h3>Giant Carp in Wusong</h3>
<p>I passed by the mouth of Wusong and saw several fishing boats, surrounded by small boats on all sides, with incessant clamor. Upon inquiring, I learned that a fisherman had just raised a net, which was very heavy, and he could not lift it by himself. He then called several people to lift it with force, and it turned out to be only one carp. Upon weighing it, it weighed 113 catties; there was a copper plate attached to its fins. There were inscriptions on the plate. Upon examination, it was found to be a fish released by a certain Mr. Kangxi in the Kangxi period. Later, a guest spent two ocean coins to buy it and put it back into the water. This fish has been around for more than 200 years since the Kangxi period. Now that it has been caught by the fisherman, it must be a catastrophe. Fortunately, it met a benevolent person and returned to the sea, so that it would not be injured. It is the spirit of the fish, and it is brought to it. Published tomorrow A Record of the Audience</p>
