<h3>上海米糧之限價</h3>
<p>近來米糧超越限價，無法維持，米業所組織之評價會，遂自動解散，此或因不得已而出此也。原夫價格之升降，基於供求之定律；若能抑之使低，揚之使高，則價之爲價，非由自然，而出於人爲；夫既出於人爲，宜可以人力限制矣，則或然，或亦不然。蓋人力不一，謀適當之限制者，人力也；爲牟利而操縱者，亦人力也；必限制之力量，遠過於操縱之方量，而後限制有效。藉日不盡繫於較量實力，亦有並非眞有其力量，而限制亦有時見效者；然及其時過境遷，又將橫決如故矣。故限價之爲用，只能濟一時之急，不能作持久之計。况若上海之米糧限價，限制之者又出於米業之本身，則其本身即有矛盾在焉。誠以經營工商業者，孰不務生產，所持商品之價格愈高翔，則獲利愈豐厚，乃有爲公衆而犧牲其一己之利益，限制其價不使上升，是眞不可多得者矣。憶限價之初，主其事者必欲米價高至十四元，而後停止出口；當時吾人即以爲疑。以爲若果高至十四元而出十四元以上，米業果將抑之使低耶？今則逐步至限價，一躍而十五元，飛躍而十七八元；未見米業發揮力量抑之使低，未聞米業運用力量遏之使不復漲；僅以自動解散評價委員會，使社會更求責難之目標而不可得；嗚呼，其可諒耶？藉日米業亦尙信義，徒以茲事體大，別有困難；然就同業之間，豈竟絕無何種調節之方法，豈竟不能保持其信誓旦旦，以表示維護民食之初衷？乃所以報答社會者，祗日，是囤積者之過也。試問囤戶何人？囤戶之米，從何而來？彼向採地自辦，抑滬上米業售與之耶？又日，操縱者之過也。試問非超限價不售，米業以外之人，抑即米業中人耶？凡此疑竇，孰得曲爲之解；不觀連日報載之米市新聞，常相矛盾，所謂欲蓋彌彰者非歟？</p>
<p>來日方長，距新穀畢登，尙有五月，此眞所謂靑黃不接之候也。芒種將臨，田事方始，未來之米市，如稻作經過良好，雨暘時若，則囤戶之米終必有傾倉而出之一日，如是則米價不平而自平；反之，亦必恣其囤積之術，堅其財貨之慾；勢非另籌接濟，別予制裁，不足以褫操縱居奇之魄。就接濟言之：邇來外滙之消耗於雜糧者，爲數已鉅，若再加以洋米結欵，因此消耗外滙更多，不但可惜，抑且可憂。况今日之米，尙非不足之爲患，實由調節之難行。彼有米者，存心叵測，惟利是圖、豈計外滙利害之輕重，豈問進口事實之有無，凡可用以拾高米價者，即無此事實　，但有此風說，亦儘可先事以居奇矣。故欲用同業本身之力量，平準米價，與虎謀皮不啻也。以制裁言之：惟有賴於政治上之力量，作其後盾，爲之監督，俾人正軌。今者米價已出十七元矣，驟欲使之回復十五元之限價，必無此事；有之，亦必米糧本身因供求之關係，逐步回降。至於紓目前之急，爲來日之計，當然以社絕囤積居奇爲先；而對於本市米糧之調節，則不應專諉之於來源，亦當就現實狀况，加以公正之處理。此其爲道：（一）須問限價尙有此需要吾，如有此需要，則限價應如何規定，如何施行；若以限價爲不適用，則應如何使米價不爲操縱所制，而得歸於安定。（二）亂世易投機，米市豈能例外，故必爲民食計，使米市投機之風，減至最低皮；則公開評價，集中買賣，平勻分配，有不可或缺者矣。昔趙忭不限價以徠米糧，播爲美談；蓋價高徠遠貨，及米糧湧至，其價自平；今則商人操縱之力量，遠非昔比，利用其雄厚之資財，非常之環境，此正投機有爲之時也；不有防範，安能措民食於安全。竊以此爲目前租界常局所責無旁貸，亦公正人士所最願合作以赴者也。</p>
<h3>對中國所提申請　國聯通達決議案　請會員國賡續個別援華　日機炸平民隨時提報告</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院、本日午前舉行公開會議、就中國所提出之申請、通過決議案兩件、（一）關於援助中國之決議案、希望各會員國賡續實施行政院與國聯會大會迭次所通過之決議案、並與國聯會大會遠東問題諮詢委員會、（卽二十三國委員會、美國亦在其列、）就切實援助中國辦法加以會議、（二）關於日本飛機轟炸中國普通人民之決議案、要求各會員國飭令駐華外交代表、注意日本飛機之行動、倘再有轟炸普通人民情事、應立卽詳細報吿國聯會行政院、以上兩項決議案、已由中國代表顧維鈞博士表示接受、幷發表演說、略謂此種決議案、較之行政院前此所採取之決定、未見有何起色、殊可惋惜、旋因行政院各理事國所可成立之協定、當以此種決議案爲唯一基礎、自不得不予以接受、但中國所提申請、仍當列入下屆會議議事日程、實有共必要、所望各會員國咸皆採取新的措置、切實援助中國、勿再以飛機煤油供給日本云、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>英文書寫</p>
<p>備以塡答、蓋兩軍官操、英語甚生疏、而不解法語也、登輪五人未偕舌人、故日軍官與雷輪長間之談話遲緩而甚困難、紙張中之主要問題、係關於阿拉密斯號之登肥證件者、日軍官欲査閱此證件、雷輪長答覆此問、吿日軍官一視該輪旗幟、但仍出示用法文印就之登記證件、日軍官</p>

<p>大戶扒進</p>
<p>本巿存米確見豐厚、足供三月之需、昨晨巿塲九時開市、十二時收盤、惟突有大戶大批扒進操縱、雖市塲現貨充斥、供求得克相應、惟因賣者存心居奇、至售價較日前回漲二三角不等、開盤呼號頭號白米為十七元五角、中次各米亦見回漲、後即以十元四角成交、因交易變化百出、買賣雙方捉摸不定、市塲成交的六千　左右、</p>
<p>水陸運滬　絡繹不絕</p>
<p>邇來各地國米來源、漸見增加、　頻傳當地仍有禁阻米糧出口、及再行增加苛捐、然各地車輪運滬　　仍絡繹不絕、時增時减而已、此爲平常情事、以產地成交數量大小而定昨日來源稍稀、車輪包子運到三千餘包、及河下到貨千餘包、至於首批西貢洋米、業將啟運、裝輪運滬調節、預料滬市存米、將愈趨豐厚、</p>
<p>邢志剛談　解散原因</p>
<p>本市豆米行業同業公會常務委員邢志剛氏云、本公會自去年六月間、爲顧全孤島民食、舉行限價以來、乃承諸同業之體諒、尙不致逾越範圍、巧自本年五月以還、蘇皖產米方面、忽有或禁或弛之訊、傳說紛紛、來源稀少、米價步漲、囤戶更不肯脫手、或有投機者、不顧民食、乃關係市民之安危、任意抬價吞吐、漲風頻傳、反造成產米區域、增加稅款負擔、以致搬運者、無利可圖、來源不暢、因之米價步漲、評價委昌會鑒於趨勢日劣、無法處置、至自動解散、此亦不得已之舉也、現蒙租界當局、關懷民食、迭經函牘往來、遏制投機、以維民食、人心已安定、市價趨疲矣、</p>
<p>分別報告　採辦經過</p>
<p>各帮販運客商、前因各產米區域、徵收苛稅、負擔增加、致無利可圖、咸抱觀望、裹足不前、來源稀少、因之米價高漲、存底趨减曰嗣經各米業團體竭力設法疏通來源、力勸各帮販運客商恢復採購、俾維滬市民食、並因各地如蕪湖·常熱·等相繼弛禁、來源增多、存底豐厚、茲各帮販客、除押貨運滬外、並將採購經過及產米區當地情形、昨日向各米業團體分別報吿、據悉、常熟。蘇州、以及南路各地　源又遭阻　、並有其他各地禁運與加捐等消息</p>
<p>門售淸淡　陷憂已除</p>
<p>昨據米號業公會消息、全市各大小米號門售部、前因來源阻滯、市塲交易、逾越限價、致人心忐忑不定、紛紛向各米號購買囤積、以致求過於供、一時頗有應接不暇之勢、茲因各地弛禁頻傳、存到俱充、米價亦吿回跌、並市塲秩序漸趨正規、故人心已告安定、隱憂已除、故門售營業日見淸淡、况大批洋米、業已成交、滬市民食、決可無虞、</p>
<h3>上海土地　逐年下陷紀錄　楊樹浦三年來陷五吋餘　其他各處每年陷一吋許</h3>
<p>大陸報云、土木工程會於五月二十二日開會、名作家兼工程師華特生在席間致詞云、一九三四年二月至一九三七年六月之間、沿楊樹浦路一帶下陷五吋有奇、此爲全上海區之下陷最甚者、是項紀錄、係自怡和路與楊樹浦路轉角之工務處</p>
<p>水準基標</p>
<p>所獲得、據信該路北岸巨大倉庫之下陷、爲該區基標變更之原因、上海其他各區亦有相類之變更、今已廢除之外灘基標、紀錄在一九二九年四月與一九三三年十二月間、下陷幾六吋、平均比率爲每年一·二六吋、同期內外灘公園外水準基標紀錄之下陷、平均每年　四分之一吋、上海</p>
<p>房屋櫛比</p>
<p>區各點之下陷、自每年三分之一吋有奇、以至幾達二吋、各點之分類與分析、乃按照鄰近載重之大小、底土之性質（即是吾在舊時河浜上）與鄰近深井之可能的影響而定、在舊時河浜上其下陷較非河浜上者迅速百分之九十、土地下陷之速度、與鄰近載重影響之大小成正比、且爲週圍四百呎以內的深井之吸收力作用、</p>

<h3>訴訟當事人用灌音方法　收取對造人自白　製成唱片呈案作為積極反證　承審推事聽唱片中兩造供詞　旁聽者均驚奇庭諭改期對質</h3>
<p>科學進步、而訴訟當事人搜集證據之方法、亦隨之進步、第二特院民庭推事夾孝恪、昨日下午三時二十分在該院民七庭審理一件返還保證金及違的金案、原吿提出唱片一張、謂係由電話中灌音收得被吿方面之自白、堪作積極反證、旁聽者聞之鮮不驚奇、該案</p>
<p>情節複雜</p>
<p>茲將詳情探誌於下、緣有浦東人名曹文裕者、住法租界寗波路五十五號、前經營滙中公司、去年三月間與其同鄕人蔡曉堤、訂立買賣小麥契的、曹謂在滁州有小麥二萬包、議定每句價七元二角六分五厘、全部出售與蔡、訂的時蔡先後付給曹定洋一萬零六百元、曹並向蔡聲明如述的、願加倍賠償、嗣曹</p>
<p>延不交貨</p>
<p>僅陸續返還蔡之保證金六千四百元、尙欠保設金四千二百兀、迄未返還、至於違的金八千元、更置之不理、因此蔡延徐錦裕律師具狀第二特院民庭控　、請求判令曹返還保證金叫千二百元、並賠償違的金八千元、該案發生後、曹委律師出庭提出和解契的一紙、謂已於去年七月間完全解決、蔡因並無訂立</p>
<p>和解契約</p>
<p>之事、故與灌音公司接洽在電話中收取曹之自白、本月二十五日晚間七時許、蔡打電話給曹、在電話中書曹盜取印章偽造和解據、係不道德行爲、曹之答詞大意謂、盜取蔡之印章祗用於該和解據上、別處並未用過、且此决係出於不得已、蔡收得曹之自白後、卽製成唱片、昨日午後三時二十分呈案、承審推事吳老恪當庭試</p>
<p>開留聲機</p>
<p>將該唱片置於留聲機上、聽取蔡在電話中與曹談話、蔡與曹兩造供詞、吳推事由留聲機中聆取一過、曹之代理律師當即起稱、此唱片中聲音是吾爲曹所發、木律師不能斷定、今天常事人並未到案、請庭上要詳加硏究、旋由徐錦裕律帥代理蔡曉堤向庭上解釋唱片中之語意、因蔡與曹均操浦東語言、並非普通話、徐律師解釋</p>
<p>唱片語意</p>
<p>後、並謂將另案控曹竊盜印章僞造文書之罪、曹所以得機會竊盜蔡之印章者、因曹與蔡係表兄弟、雖發生訟案、兩造仍時常往還、庭上核詞、因爲有傳曹文裕與唱片對質之必要、遂諭改期六月十四日上午十時再訊、並論令原吿蔡曉堤下决仍須將唱片連同留聲機一併帶到法庭候質對、退庭後、旁聽者咸謂此乃取證之新紀錄、今後在電話中說話、亦須愼重云、</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in the Dabie Mountains of Northern Hubei Launch Another Attack on Suixian with Heavy Casualties; Valiant Chinese Troops Resist in Fierce Battles Near Suixian; Chinese Troops Recapture Key Positions in Nanlinqiao and Donghua One After Another; Chinese Troops Ambush at Gangkou with Good Results, Japanese Retreat to Wujiang Bridge</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) As of the 27th, the war situation has not changed significantly. Japanese troops attacking Suizhou, the Dabie Mountains, and Xinji were severely struck by Chinese forces, suffering nearly a thousand casualties and are still engaged in fierce battles nearby. A Chinese unit has cut off Japanese lines of communication near Zhongxiang. Chinese forces have the upper hand in battles along the Dongting Lake shore in northern Hunan. Guerilla warfare continues in the suburbs of Guangzhou. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) It is reported that fierce battles are currently underway near Suixian in northern Hubei. According to forward Chinese sources, Japanese troops from the Dabie Mountains are now advancing on Suixian in three columns, hoping to recapture the city. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to information received here, the major battle in Hubei has temporarily ended since the Chinese army recovered Suixian. According to Chinese claims, Japanese forces have suffered 15,000 casualties in Hubei Province, half of whom are said to have died on the battlefield. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 27th) According to news received here this morning, fierce fighting has broken out again in the Dabie Mountains area of northern Hubei. Seven thousand Japanese troops are counter-attacking Suixian. Chinese troops are valiantly resisting, but Suixian has once again been lost. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Fancheng (1) When Japanese troops decisively launched multi-pronged attacks to seize Suizao but suffered a disastrous defeat and retreated southward in disarray, they were ambushed and intercepted in segments by a Chinese unit stationed in the Dabie Mountains. Japanese corpses littered the fields. The vanguard of Japanese troops retreating south through Dunxiang has now reached the Yangjiadong area in a very distressed state. (2) In recent days, there has been a slight increase in Japanese troops in Sanyangdian and Pingnian, and they are building fortifications. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Luoluo On the morning of the 26th, approximately six or seven hundred Japanese troops attacked Gangkou (ten kilometers northeast of Xinqiang) and Yanjia Dashan (six kilometers northwest of Xinqiang). Chinese troops counterattacked separately. By noon on the 27th, Chinese troops in the Gangkou area had dispatched a strong unit of a certain division, bypassing the foot of Yunshan Mountain to the rear of the Japanese troops and launching a two-pronged encirclement and ambush with the frontal Chinese forces. The Japanese suffered more than 400 casualties and retreated to Wujiang Bridge. Currently, Chinese troops in Gangkou have joined up with the attacking unit and are pursuing the Japanese. Japanese troops in the Yanjia Dashan area, having repeatedly failed to attack, switched to defending their strongholds on the 27th, only occasionally using artillery to launch indiscriminate bombardments on Chinese positions, hoping to hinder the Chinese advance. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Changde Frontline reports indicate that Japanese troops in Yueyang have been increasing in number in recent days. Japanese troops in Xitang launched a fierce attack on Chinese forces yesterday, resulting in a fierce battle. After a long standoff, the Chinese positions remained firmly in place. Unable to succeed, the Japanese ceased fire and retreated to their original positions. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Guilin On the morning of the 25th, Japanese troops again advanced in two groups of 300 each towards Tangjiapaitou in Gangkou, attacking strongholds held by Chinese forces. The Chinese army counterattacked, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The Japanese troops in Gangkou have been repelled. The Japanese troops in Tangjiapaitou are still engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Changde A phone call from Huarong reported that on the afternoon of the 25th, four small Japanese motorboats attempted to land near Qiganzui along the Dongting Lake coast from Yueyang. They were discovered by Chinese garrison troops, who immediately opened fire. The Japanese troops quickly used machine gun fire for cover and fled backward. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to authoritative military figures here, after the Japanese attempt to cross the Xinjiang River in northern Hunan failed, they are now preparing to launch a large-scale attack. A large contingent of reinforcements is being sent from Shanghai to Yuezhou. There are currently 27 warships and 20 motorboats stationed near Yuezhou. A large amount of military supplies, including heavy tanks, has been transported. At the same time, they are strengthening defensive fortifications in the suburbs of Yuezhou to use it as a base for advancing west or south. Simultaneously, Japanese troops are attempting to eliminate Chinese mobile units and repair damaged roads between Chongyang and Tongcheng on the Wuchang-Changsha Highway. However, this work has been ineffective because not only are fresh Chinese troops slowly arriving, but the situation has completely changed after Chinese forces recovered five key military points south of Tongcheng. The Qian section of the Wuchang-Changsha Highway is now completely under Chinese control. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Pingjiang A powerful Chinese guerrilla force operating in southern Hubei encountered over a hundred Japanese troops in the area south of Yangxin on the 25th. The Chinese force killed over forty and wounded over fifty Japanese troops. The telephone lines along the highway between Yangxin and Xintanbu, and the railway and highway bridges between Xianning and Tingsiqiao and Nanlinqiao have been thoroughly destroyed in more than ten places by Chinese forces in recent days. The Japanese are suffering from a lack of coordination and are exhausted from running around. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Pingjiang Intense fighting has been taking place near Nanlinqiao between Tongshan and Chongyang for the past week. Starting on the 20th, 3,000 Japanese infantry and 5-600 cavalry launched a fierce attack along multiple routes on Luojia, Chongdalaishan, Zeshan, Yangfanglin, Guojia, and Chongxinfeng Temple (all located east and south of Nanlinqiao), attempting to eliminate Chinese attacking units and encircle Tongshan from the rear. Luojia, Chongdalaishan, and other places had briefly fallen into Japanese hands. Subsequently, a Chinese unit controlled the area near Chongxinfeng Temple, while another unit struck the Japanese flank. The main force circled around to Zeshan and recaptured Dalaishan in one fell swoop at dawn on the 23rd. They recovered Guojia and Luojia on the night of the 22nd, and swept the Japanese troops from Yangfanglin, restoring the original positions. Starting on the 24th, a certain Chinese unit crossed the highway again and launched a pincer attack on Japanese troops in Nanlinqiao. The Chinese annihilated over 500 Japanese troops. As of the evening of the 26th, both sides were still engaged in fierce fighting near Nanlinqiao. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Crushing the Japanese Plot: The Recovery of Suizao in Retrospect</p>
<p>Suixian The war situation in central Hubei: Chinese and Japanese troops have been facing off along the Suixian-Jingshan line for six months since last year. At the beginning of this year, the Japanese attempted to capture Xiangfan and control Jingyi, advancing westward along the Jingzhong and Hanyi routes. After occupying Jiukou in Zhongxiang, they were pressured by the large Chinese army in Suizao and unable to cross the river westward. Chinese troops in Suizao also launched an attack last month, forcing their way into Yingshan and threatening Wuhan. Unable to succeed, the Japanese then deployed hundreds of heavy field guns and several squadrons of aircraft to launch a three-pronged attack on the Chinese left flank in Suizao, one from the Xianghua Road, one from Tianhekou, and one from Zhongxiang along the Xiang River northward. The Japanese troops facing Suizao were met with a head-on counterattack by a certain Chinese unit, and were unable to succeed. The Japanese troops in the Tianhekou area were severely damaged by Chinese forces, and then moved from Zhongxiang, scurrying north toward Zaojing, and spreading to Xinye and Lianghe, attempting to encircle the Chinese rear in Suizao on a large scale. Chinese forces had long discerned their plot, and bravely resisted while transferring positions for several ten-day periods. Japanese casualties were staggering, with corpses lying in the valleys and wheat fields along both sides of the highway, totaling no less than two or three thousand. Subsequently, Chinese troops deployed heavy troops in the Dabie Mountains and Tongbai Mountains in turn to cut off the enemy's rear. At the same time, the Japanese troops that had broken into Suizao were surrounded on all sides from Zhongxiang, eastern Hubei, and southern Henan. The main Chinese force also launched a fierce counterattack. The Japanese, with unstable footholds, heavy casualties, deep in the mud, and cut off from supplies, set fire to the cities of Suizao and fled in disarray towards Anlu and Yingshan from the 17th. Corpses littered the road, and many wounded soldiers, supplies, and horses were abandoned. The Japanese attempt to encircle and annihilate was ultimately defeated, and the two county towns of Suizao were decisively recovered on the 18th and 19th. It was discovered that the Japanese mainly used the most tenacious 3rd, 13th, and 16th divisions as their main force, rushing around like wild beasts and displaying fierce flames. However, as a result of the decisive battle, more than 20,000 were killed or wounded. Although the Chinese side suffered considerable sacrifices, it achieved the purpose of attrition warfare and inflicted significant damage on the Japanese, crushing their conspiracy to encircle and annihilate. It was truly a great victory in the second phase of the Chinese War of Resistance. (Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Japanese Three-pronged Attack on the Min Mountains Repelled by Chinese Troops</p>
<p>Fengcheng The Chinese Jiangbei guerrillas, after retreating from the isolated force on Mount Lu, have largely gathered in the Min Mountains, establishing close contact with the original troops in the mountains. Their momentum is even greater than before, and they frequently attack the Japanese troops on the Nanxun Line. The Japanese consider them a thorn in their side and have repeatedly attempted to encircle them, but have suffered heavy casualties. Starting on the morning of the 21st, the Japanese again gathered over 800 remaining troops with over ten cannons and launched a three-pronged attack on Lingshangwang, a key stronghold in the Min Mountains. One route, with over 400 Japanese troops, advanced from Heliyu, attacking Chenzhuang Dawulong, attacking the east of Lingshangwang. Another route, with over 200 Japanese troops, made a detour from the Min Mountains towards Shanbei, attacking the north of Lingshangwang. Another route, with over 200 Japanese troops, attacked the south of Lingshangwang from Pingfeng. Their artillery was distributed in the Xiaoyangpu Quanshui Cave area, concentrating firepower and fiercely bombing Lingshangwang over twenty times as cover. The Chinese troops fought bravely for about an hour, but because the Japanese artillery fire was fierce, Chenzhuang Dawulong, two lines of alert posts were broken through by the Japanese. Chinese troops retreated to positions near Lingshangwang and strongly resisted. Fierce fighting continued until noon, with more than ten hand-to-hand combats. A certain Chinese company suffered heavy casualties and retreated again to the highest peak position in the Min Mountains. The Japanese troops continued to attack fiercely. The Chinese commander urgently transferred two battalions and coordinated with the Jiujiang People's Self-Defense Force, rushing to support them overnight, and launching fierce attacks on the Japanese backs in Heliyu, Jigongling, Wushimen, and other places in four routes. At the same time, various lines also took the opportunity to counterattack. The Japanese troops were attacked from the front and rear, and their momentum gradually weakened, and they collapsed. By noon on the 22nd, after a bloody battle, the Chinese army recovered the stronghold of Lingshangwang and took advantage of the situation to pursue and kill the remaining Japanese troops, who fled back to Heliyu, Jigongling, and other original places. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce. Chinese loyal and brave soldiers, without drinking or eating, bathed in artillery fire for two days and nights, and finally defeated the stubborn Japanese. It is estimated that hundreds of Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and a light machine gun, dozens of rifles, and countless spoils of war were captured. The Chinese army also suffered more than 30 officer and soldier casualties. (Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Will Surely Recover Anqiu</h3>
<p>A certain place in eastern Shandong A certain Chinese unit has been attacking Anqiu for days, engaged in fierce battles with several hundred Japanese troops. On the night of the 23rd, Chinese troops launched a fierce assault, breaking into the city. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted in the streets and alleys, resulting in fierce street fighting. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and fled, and Anqiu was immediately recovered by Chinese troops. In this battle, over two hundred Japanese troops were killed. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Nantong Retreat to Jinsha</h3>
<p>A certain place in northern Jiangsu Over two hundred Japanese infantry and artillery troops in Nantong, on nine motorboats, along with over sixty Japanese troops in Jinsha, advanced on Qiananzhen by land and water. Chinese troops launched a head-on counterattack and dispatched teams to encircle from the left and right. After six hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and retreated to Jinsha. The Japanese attacked again that night but were again repelled by the Chinese. A Japanese officer named Masao Sawada was killed, and eighty soldiers were killed or wounded. The Chinese side sacrificed two platoon leaders and over twenty soldiers. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Qinghe County Magistrate Killed En Route</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The power of guerrilla forces in various counties of Hebei Province is expanding. Earlier, a puppet Qingyuan County (Baoding) inspector was killed by a certain Chinese unit. Recently, Sun Yingbin, the puppet Qinghe County Magistrate, was killed by a certain Chinese unit on the 18th while traveling from Shunde to Qinghe. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Price Limits on Rice in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have exceeded the set limits, making it impossible to maintain them. The price evaluation committee organized by the rice industry has therefore voluntarily disbanded. This may have been due to unavoidable circumstances. The rise and fall of prices is based on the law of supply and demand; if one can suppress them to make them low, or raise them to make them high, then the price is no longer natural, but artificial. Since it is artificial, it should be possible to limit it by human means. That may be true, or it may not be. Human power is not uniform. Those who devise appropriate restrictions are using human power; those who manipulate for profit are also using human power. Only if the strength of the restrictions far exceeds the extent of the manipulation will the restrictions be effective. Even if it does not depend entirely on measuring strength, there are times when restrictions are effective even without real power. However, when the time passes and the situation changes, they will break loose as before. Therefore, the use of price limits can only solve an immediate crisis and cannot be a long-term plan. Moreover, if the price limits on rice in Shanghai are imposed by the rice industry itself, then there is an inherent contradiction. Indeed, among those engaged in industry and commerce, who does not strive for production? The higher the price of the goods they hold, the greater the profit they obtain. Therefore, to sacrifice one's own interests for the public and restrict the price to prevent it from rising is truly rare. Remembering the beginning of price limits, those in charge insisted that the rice price should reach fourteen yuan before exports were stopped; at that time, we were suspicious. We thought that if the price really rose to fourteen yuan and exceeded fourteen yuan, would the rice industry suppress it to make it lower? Now it has gradually reached the price limit, jumping to fifteen yuan and soaring to seventeen or eighteen yuan. We have not seen the rice industry exert its power to suppress it, and we have not heard of the rice industry using its power to prevent it from rising again; only with the voluntary dissolution of the price evaluation committee, making it impossible for society to seek a target for blame. Alas, is that understandable? Assuming that the rice industry still has integrity, and that this matter is just too big and there are other difficulties; however, within the industry, is there absolutely no way to adjust, and is it absolutely impossible to maintain its vows to show its original intention to protect the people's food? All it does to repay society is say that it is the fault of the hoarders. We ask, who are the hoarders? Where does the hoarders' rice come from? Do they purchase it directly from the producing areas, or do the Shanghai rice merchants sell it to them? It is also said that it is the fault of the manipulators. We ask, are those who refuse to sell unless the price exceeds the limit people outside the rice industry, or people within the rice industry? Who can explain all these doubts? Don't we see that the rice market news reported in the newspapers these days is often contradictory, isn't it trying to cover up what is already obvious?</p>
<p>There is still a long way to go. It is still five months until the new grain is fully available. This is truly what is called the time of scarcity. The Grain Rain season is approaching, and field work is just beginning. Regarding the future rice market, if the rice crop is good, with timely rain and sunshine, then the hoarders' rice will eventually have to be released; in that case, the rice price will stabilize on its own. Conversely, they will inevitably indulge in hoarding and hold onto their goods; it will be necessary to find other ways to provide relief and impose other sanctions to eliminate the speculators' courage. Regarding relief: the amount of foreign exchange consumed on miscellaneous grains recently has been huge. If we add the payment for foreign rice, this will consume even more foreign exchange, which is not only regrettable, but also worrying. Moreover, the problem today is not the lack of rice, but the difficulty in regulation. Those who have rice have ulterior motives, seeking only profit. How could they consider the importance of foreign exchange or ask about the existence of imports? All that can be used to raise rice prices, even if the fact does not exist, but there is such a rumor, can be used to speculate in advance. Therefore, to use the power of the industry itself to stabilize rice prices is like seeking skin from a tiger. Regarding sanctions: we can only rely on political power to back it up and supervise it, so that people can get on the right track. Now that the rice price has reached seventeen yuan, there is no way to make it return to the limit of fifteen yuan; if it does, it must be because the rice itself, due to the relationship between supply and demand, is gradually falling back down. As for alleviating the current crisis and planning for the future, of course, it is necessary to first stop hoarding and speculation; and for the regulation of rice in this city, we should not only blame the source, but also fairly deal with the current situation. The way to do this is: (1) We must ask whether there is still a need for price limits. If there is, then how should the price limits be set and implemented? If price limits are considered inapplicable, then how should we prevent the rice price from being controlled by manipulation and return to stability? (2) It is easy to speculate in troubled times, and the rice market cannot be an exception. Therefore, we must consider the people's food and reduce the speculation in the rice market to the lowest level; then public evaluation, centralized buying and selling, and equal distribution are indispensable. Zhao Bian did not limit prices to attract rice, which was praised as a good story; because high prices attract goods from far away, and when the rice arrives, the price will stabilize on its own. But now, the power of merchants to manipulate is far greater than in the past, and they use their abundant funds and extraordinary circumstances. This is exactly the time when speculation can be profitable; without prevention, how can we ensure the safety of the people's food? We believe that this is the unshakeable responsibility of the current Municipal Council of the Concession, and it is also what fair-minded people are most willing to cooperate with.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Transmits Resolutions on China's Applications; Asks Member States to Continue Individual Aid to China; Reports on Japanese Aircraft Bombing Civilians to be Submitted at Any Time</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held a public meeting this morning, and passed two resolutions regarding China's application. (1) Regarding the resolution to aid China, it hopes that all member states will continue to implement the resolutions repeatedly passed by the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations, and consult with the Advisory Committee on Far Eastern Issues of the Assembly of the League of Nations (namely, the Twenty-Three Nation Committee, which also includes the United States) on practical ways to aid China. (2) Regarding the resolution on Japanese aircraft bombing ordinary Chinese people, it requires all member states to instruct their diplomatic representatives stationed in China to pay attention to the actions of Japanese aircraft, and if there is any further bombing of ordinary people, they should immediately report the details to the Council of the League of Nations. Both resolutions have been accepted by the Chinese representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, and he delivered a speech, stating that such resolutions do not show any improvement compared to the decisions previously taken by the Council, which is regrettable. However, because of the agreements that can be established by the various member states of the Council, this kind of resolution is the only basis, so it must be accepted. However, the applications submitted by China should still be included in the agenda of the next meeting, which is really necessary. It is hoped that all member states will take new measures to effectively aid China and no longer supply aircraft and kerosene to Japan. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations has recently passed two resolutions regarding China's applications: (1) China's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are threatened by Japanese aggression, and the country is bravely resisting and striving for self-defense, and the nation is suffering greatly. The Council expresses its deep sympathy to the country, and believes that the methods of aiding China, including relief for refugees and other practical measures deemed feasible, should be effective. All countries directly involved in the development of the Far Eastern situation are acting together in a unified manner, and the Council is watching the development with great concern. It also expresses satisfaction with the fact that certain countries have provided aid to China in several ways, and hopes that this aid can be continued and that the resolutions repeatedly passed by the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations will be implemented by all member states. All member states should also consult with the Advisory Committee on Far Eastern Issues on practical ways to aid China. (2) "The Council, because the Assembly of the League of Nations has successively passed resolutions on September 28, 1937 and September 30, 1938, and because the Chinese representative has declared that certain member and non-member states have advised their citizens not to supply aircraft to Japan or have directly prohibited them, etc., is very willing and appropriate. It applies to all member states of the Council and the Advisory Committee on Far Eastern Issues that have official representatives stationed in China to collect and report on Japanese aircraft bombing ordinary people, and immediately notify the Council." (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The League of Nations is Weak and Only Offers Lip Service; Representative Gu Expresses Discontent</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations met today and passed a resolution on China that only expresses sympathy and does not offer substantial assistance. After blaming Japan for bombing undefended cities in China, the resolution states that in theory, consideration should be given to how to organize an international committee to investigate the problems arising from the bombing, but claims that the Council of the League of Nations itself cannot organize such a committee. It currently intends to ask the member states of the League of Nations to order their diplomatic representatives stationed in China to collect various materials on Japanese air raids and send them to the Council of the League of Nations for research. The Chinese Chief Ambassador Gu Weijun immediately declared that the resolution passed by the Council of the League of Nations could not satisfy the Chinese people. The Chinese representative could not accept the above-mentioned resolution unless it was accompanied by the following condition: the opinions of China's application must be discussed at the League of Nations Council meeting this autumn. According to people close to the Chinese representative, Ambassador Gu had made various suggestions, but the Council of the League of Nations did not adopt any of them. Lip service is not enough to be effective, which is disappointing. It is hoped that the European situation will clear up as soon as possible, so that when the autumn meeting is held, the representatives of the countries participating in the League of Nations Council meeting can pay more attention to the Far Eastern events.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Southeastern Yuhang Advance to Liuxia</h3>

Residents in the town took the opportunity to respond. The Japanese troops were unable to hold out, burned down many civilian houses, and fled westward from the town.

<h3>English Newspaper Believes the Situation is Serious - Japan Absolutely Has No Legal Right to Blockade - Intentional Provocation of Britain is Clearly Visible</h3>
<p>(London) The Menchester Guardian's editorial today stated that Japan is currently making a resolute effort to test the resolve of Western nations, especially Britain. Although the Xiamen crisis has not yet fully subsided, Japan's declaration of blockading the entire Chinese coast is obviously of a tentative nature, but it is extremely serious. This is because Japan has absolutely no legal right to declare a blockade, and also because Japan, based on the absurd reason of checking nationality, intercepted the British ship "Rangpura." It is now obvious that Japan intends to provoke Britain to see to what extent Britain can tolerate it. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times this morning commented on the new tension between Japan and Britain and other countries caused by recent events on the Chinese coast. It stated that the Japanese naval authorities recently attempted to create an illegal situation in Xiamen, but failed, causing them to lose face. The current oppressive actions of Japanese warships outside Hong Kong are directly related to the development of the Xiamen incident. It is not surprising that there is an attempt to make new changes before the Xiamen incident is resolved. The oppression imposed by Japan on foreigners in Shanghai and the promises made by the Japanese side to respect the rights and interests of foreigners are now worthless. Even German and Italian residents in China feel greatly inconvenienced, not to mention other foreigners. However, it is conceivable that Japan may soon have reasons to reconsider its foreign policy in China. Japan's attempt to defeat China has now proven to be a miscalculation, and Japan's attempt to drive out the British, Americans and other powers from China through various provocations will ultimately prove to be equally unsuccessful. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today did not mention or publish the fact that the British House of Commons discussed the Japanese interception of the British ship "Rangpura" yesterday, nor did they publish the fact that Japanese destroyers dispatched troops outside Hong Kong on Wednesday to inspect British ships.

<p>(Chongqing) The de facto blockade of the Chinese coast by Japan and the negotiations on the anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are now receiving close attention from people here. According to informed Chinese observers, these two matters, although seemingly completely unrelated, are actually closely related. It is said that Japan and Spain have secretly signed military pacts with Germany and Italy, but are currently refraining from publicly joining the German-Italian military alliance in order to avoid promoting close relations between democratic nations and certain countries, including the Soviet Union. In the Axis powers' plan, Japan is responsible for exerting pressure on foreign concessions in China and on foreign trade and shipping in China, so that Britain and France cannot concentrate their attention and efforts on European affairs. If a European war breaks out, Japan will not maintain neutrality, but will attempt to seize the Dutch East Indies as an important base in its long-planned southward invasion program.

<h3>British Ambassador Submits Memorandum - Foreign Ministry Firmly Denies - Japanese Rumors that Various Countries are Preparing to Mediate - Completely Fabricated, Intended to Disrupt Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has today formally denied the news released by the Japanese side on May 24 that British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr had submitted a memorandum to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing. According to the Japanese side, this memorandum contained the following two points: (1) In view of the principles stipulated in the League of Nations' resolution on China, various countries are prepared to mediate, but if direct negotiations between China and Japan are needed, they will not object. (2) Various countries do not oppose Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly declares that this news from the Japanese side is completely unfounded and is entirely fabricated, intended to disrupt public opinion in the Far East.

According to the published remarks, Zhongyue's talents are shallow and his body is weak, making it difficult for him to shoulder heavy responsibilities. Having been entrusted by the central authorities with the post of Minister of Internal Affairs, he was unable to decline. Having repeatedly received the sincere advice of Chairman Long Yun of this province, he could not refuse, so he reluctantly accepted the position.

<p>(Moscow) A Pravda editorial commented on the report made by Soviet Finance Commissioner Zverev at the third session of the Supreme Soviet, stating that the Soviet Union's 1939 budget has a revenue of 155.607 billion rubles, an increase of 22% over the previous year. Approximately two-thirds of this huge amount is allocated to investment in the national economy and social and cultural undertakings, and huge sums have also been allocated to the construction of new factories, the development of industry, transportation, and agricultural industry. At the same time, the budget bill pays attention to strengthening national defense. Our people unanimously hope that the Red Army and Navy will become stronger.

If a war breaks out, all fascist elements who hope to make a fortune will not end well. "This is a huge and astonishing figure for socialist construction in the second year of the Third Five-Year Plan, which the entire country and the world will hear and know.

<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement Purely Defensive in Nature - Guided by the Spirit of the League of Nations Covenant - Soviet Suggestions to Britain Likely to be Accepted - Franco-Turkish Pact Can be Established in Geneva Soon</h3>
<p>(Moscow) British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds, accompanied by the French Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, submitted Anglo-French proposals to Soviet Premier Molotov at 4 pm today. Vice-Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, who recently returned from Europe, is likely to serve as an interpreter. It is widely believed that today's meeting will be the decisive stage in the current negotiations. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was announced by the authorities that the French Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union, Mr. Payart, and the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Seeds, had been instructed by their governments to jointly visit the Soviet People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Molotov, to personally hand over the draft of the Mutual Assistance Agreement between the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. In addition, the Mutual Assistance Agreement between France and Turkey may also be established within the next week. In short, the Mutual Assistance Agreement advocated by the United Kingdom and France is guided by the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and is purely of a defensive nature. It will not be implemented until one of the signatory countries is attacked or threatened with aggression. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Government's new proposals to the Soviet Government regarding the conclusion of an alliance have been drafted on the basis of talks conducted in London, Moscow, Paris and Geneva in recent weeks. It is expected that the Soviet Government will need several days to study and complete them after receiving them. The British Government's views have been notified to the governments concerned through diplomatic channels at any time. The new proposals are 400 words long. While the Soviet Government is studying them, there will be no new developments. After the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Maisky, returns from Geneva next week, he will have the opportunity to discuss outstanding issues concerning the alliance with the British Foreign Secretary Halifax. Mr. Halifax has left London for Berkshire to spend his weekend holiday, but is still maintaining contact with the Foreign Office. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The atmosphere in Paris has been much more optimistic than in previous weeks during the Pentecost holiday, because people generally feel that the anti-aggression agreement between the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union will soon become a reality. Although the Soviet Union's diplomacy is proceeding slowly, it is expected that there will be concrete results soon, creating a genuine three-country agreement that will provide guarantees to all parties to the agreement. The negotiations between France and Turkey to conclude an agreement have made good progress. It is likely that it will be announced on May 29 or at the latest by May 31. The opposition from some French people who hate the cession of the Hatay region to Turkey has gradually decreased due to the increasing recognition of the importance of Turkey's friendship and its strategic position. According to the Intransigeant newspaper, once the agreement with Moscow is concluded, the United Kingdom will launch a large-scale peace conference and invite Germany and Italy to participate. However, responsible circles in Paris are completely unaware of this proposal. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The mutual assistance agreement between France and Turkey can be established soon. The content of this agreement includes: (1) a joint declaration of mutual guarantee similar to the Anglo-Turkish agreement, (2) a provision to transfer Alexandria and Sanjak to Turkey, and (3) a guarantee on the part of Turkey for the current border between Turkey and Syria. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the issue of the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, from the beginning of the talks, the Soviet Union has been demanding that an alliance treaty be concluded. Now that the United Kingdom has agreed to do so, the draft agreement jointly prepared by the United Kingdom and France will undoubtedly be accepted by the Soviet Union. This move is extremely important, allowing the Soviet Union to share weal and woe with the democratic countries of capitalism. From now on, there is the possibility of being involved in the whirlpool of war. However, the Soviet newspapers, knowing that such a major event is taking place, have remained silent and have not commented on it. Even at the Supreme Soviet meeting today, many speeches were delivered, but no one mentioned the Anglo-Soviet alliance. In general, the Soviet government will wait until a concrete decision has been made before publicizing it to the people. The People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Molotov, may also wait until the negotiations are completed or the Supreme Soviet is adjourned before delivering a speech to the Supreme Soviet. Therefore, at present, people can only wait and see. In addition, General Voroshilov, the People's Commissar of National Defense, has recently received an invitation from the British government to visit the British army's exercises in September. This is also a matter that deserves attention. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Draft Agreement Contents, Notification to Related Nations, British Military Delegation Arrives in Moscow, Talks to Begin Upon Signing</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the contents of the mutual assistance agreement draft between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British government has recently notified the governments of various Eastern European countries, the United States government, and the governments of various dominions. The British ambassador to Poland and the minister to Romania, after receiving instructions from their government, have delivered the British note to their respective host governments. Dominion Minister Inskip has also submitted an outline of the draft to the high commissioners of the dominions stationed in London. Officials here hint that the draft agreement contains a provision stating that if Britain and France fulfill their guarantee obligations to European countries and are thus drawn into war, the Soviet Union should immediately send troops to assist. Furthermore, Poland and Romania have now agreed that Soviet troops may pass through their territories in wartime, but request guarantees that they will withdraw immediately after the end of the war. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the mutual assistance agreement have recently been commented on by various newspapers here, all stating that the agreement is about to be concluded. The right-wing *Le Figaro* reported that a British military delegation arrived in Moscow last week, and that military authorities from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will begin discussions as soon as the agreement is signed. The right-wing *Paris Echo* reported that the agreement could be signed before the British Parliament reconvenes (June 5), and that military talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union could begin before the end of June. The right-wing *Le Matin* reported, "The proposal made by the British and French governments to the Soviet government stipulates that European countries must first resist threats from other countries with military force before they can request military assistance from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. If one of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, accepts the call of another country, the other two countries should automatically provide support." (Havas Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>Two Major Groups Confront Each Other, Strength Gradually Becomes Clear, Germany and Italy Actively Inducing Japan to Join</h3>
<p>(Rome) Well-informed sources here recently declared that after the establishment of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy may attempt to win over Japan to sign a military alliance treaty, and invite Spain and Hungary to sign and join as a retaliatory measure. If this move is implemented, it could have two impacts: (1) After the expansion of the alliance between Germany and Italy, certain small European countries that are still wavering between the democratic countries and the totalitarian countries will have to make a choice; (2) After the strengths of the above two major groups are clarified, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy may hold a conference to find ways to resolve various important outstanding issues. In addition, after the current tense situation has persisted for a long time, Germany and Italy hope that public opinion in Britain and France will feel weary and thus accept the demands made by the totalitarian countries. (Havas Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures in London believe that after Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude an alliance, the three countries will begin to adopt a more active policy towards the situation in the Far East. According to this, it is pointed out that this agreement will increase the Soviet Union's position in Europe, allowing it to adopt a more forward policy towards the East. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union's shipment of military supplies to China through Xinjiang will greatly increase recently. After the British situation in Europe is "clarified," it will also adopt a more drastic attitude. Political figures here stated that the landing of naval forces from Britain, France, and the United States in Gulangyu is a symbol of this trend. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Support the Soviet Union's Proposal, Oppose Fortifications on the Åland Islands, League of Nations Decides to Extend Discussion Period, So That the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Finland Can Hold Direct Talks</h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, diplomatic circles reported that Britain and France are willing to support the League of Nations' proposal and oppose agreeing to fortifications on the Åland Islands. According to the mutual assistance agreement that is about to be established, Britain and France stipulate that the Soviet Union should find a way to keep the German navy busy in the Baltic Sea and use military force to blockade German shipping in the area. However, the Soviet Union is deeply afraid that if the islands are fortified, Germany may occupy the islands during wartime and blockade the Soviet Union's Baltic Fleet. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) In addition, regarding the issue of fortifications on the Baltic Sea's Åland Islands, after the Soviet government requested the League of Nations to extend the discussion period, the rapporteur for this case, Belgian representative Bourquin, will propose to the Executive Council to temporarily adjourn the meeting for two weeks so that Sweden and Finland can conduct direct negotiations with the Soviet Union. At that time, the meeting will be reconvened to resolve the case. According to the agreement on the Åland Islands fortifications issue, Sweden and Finland have already established an agreement, which has been agreed to by the signatory countries of the 1921 agreement, namely Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Denmark. However, the Soviet Union is not a signatory country, and the islands are not far from the Gulf of Finland. If another country uses it as a base in the future, it can blockade the Gulf of Finland and obstruct the Soviet Union's access to the sea. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that the fortification plan agreed upon by Finland and Sweden should be notified to the Soviet Union, and requests the Executive Council to extend the discussion period for this case.

<h3>Italy and Germany Discuss Air Force Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Prime Minister met with General Milch, the German Undersecretary of Aviation and Chief of Staff of the Air Force, today. Italian Undersecretary of Aviation General Valle was also present. According to General Milch, he came with several air force officers to determine the cooperation methods between the air forces of both sides in accordance with the alliance treaty between Germany and Italy.

<h3>Italian-Greek Marriage Does Not Contain Political Significance</h3>

<h3>Italian Ambassador in London Severely Criticizes British and French Policies, Violating Diplomatic Traditions, Arousing Resentment Among British and French People</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, attended a gathering of Italian and German expatriates in London yesterday and delivered a speech, stating, "Europe at this moment is still like someone suffering from a stroke, wanting to use new mistakes and new acts of violence to save old injustices. The two major democratic countries are willing to make irresponsible remarks, wantonly slandering Germany and Italy. This kind of foolish crime is only enough to prove that our enemies are frustrated due to their inability to do anything. However, the political intentions of these democratic countries are thus clearly revealed." As for France, whenever the rights of fascist Italy need to be protected, that country's policies always conflict with them, which we cannot forget. In short, Germany and Italy have already shaken the pillars of the Treaty of Versailles and are about to completely overthrow it to lay the foundation for a truly fair peace for the world." Newspapers here recently reprinted this speech. *Il Giornale d'Italia* reported that it is truly rare for an Italian diplomat to speak so loudly in the capital of a major European country. Ambassador Grandi spoke in the enemy's trenches, which is commendable. (Havas Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strong criticism of French newspapers by the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, has aroused criticism from the newspapers in Paris. This speech was given on Thursday afternoon at the Italian Embassy in London to celebrate the signing of the German-Italian alliance. German Ambassador Dieckhoff was also present. The London newspapers did not publish it, but the Italian newspapers all published it in prominent positions. *L'Ordre* stated that it is the duty of an ambassador not to express political views to the public in the capital where he is stationed, but Grandi did not abide by this traditional etiquette. Newspapers here generally believe that Grandi delivered this speech under the instructions of Mussolini. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) After the Italian Ambassador Grandi delivered a speech here yesterday at a gathering of Italian and German expatriates, fiercely attacking Britain and France, well-informed sources here commented that since Italian Foreign Minister Ciano failed to achieve various demands made to France, newspapers have reported that Ambassador Grandi will succeed as Foreign Minister. At that time, foreign parties interpreted this as saying that Grandi has always been known for opposing Germany and is a more moderate person. If he succeeds as Foreign Minister, Italy may distance itself from Germany. Ambassador Grandi, due to the position he holds, has already been negatively affected by this. Therefore, he delivered a fierce speech yesterday, expressing his loyalty to fascism, in order to protect his political life. Most important figures in Britain who are on good terms with Ambassador Grandi have severely criticized him, and political figures in Britain who are unwilling to approach Italy have become more justified, saying that Ambassador Grandi had no choice but to violate the traditional attitude of diplomatic circles and openly express opposition to the host country, that is, an opposing nation, in order to protect his personal position and political life.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's New Book, "In Search of Peace," The Past Cannot Be Recalled, But the Future Can Still Be Pursued, Future Generations Will Have a Fair Judgment of Personal Merits and Demerits</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, during his time in office, engaged in writing, with a book titled "In Search of Peace." It describes in detail his efforts on international issues from the time he took office as Prime Minister in May 1937 to the time when Britain and Poland established a mutual assistance agreement in April of this year, and includes a brief preface, stating that Britain will never retreat if any country seeks to seize [territory] by force. Or "Although Britain is determined to resist this kind of attempt, it does not prohibit any country from presenting its difficulties or stating its wishes, so that other countries can discuss and seek solutions with sincerity and goodwill based on a spirit of understanding. Looking back at the developments of the past twenty years, there have been many mistakes. If the politicians of various countries at that time had been able to act with a more wise attitude, at least several of the difficulties we face today could have been avoided. Although the past cannot be recalled, the future can still be pursued, as long as countries around the world are awed by the painful lessons, awaken and follow the right path, then clarity can be expected. The situation is currently full of alarms, but clinging to hope, I would like to take this opportunity to seek cooperation and work together for peace." The Prime Minister also declared his personal efforts in the conclusion, saying, "In the past six months, I have deeply felt that the nations of the world are willing to maintain peace. Although some have ridiculed or criticized my efforts, most people will surely sympathize with them. Even if peace has not yet been firmly established and war has not yet broken out, only the people of the world in future generations will judge whether it is merit or demerit." (Havas Telegraph, 26th) "The meaning of Italy's current administrative system being worthless can be seen from this." (Havas Telegraph, 26th)</p>

<h3>The Danzig Issue, Preparations for War Between Germany and Poland, Expert Observations on Poland's Military Strength</h3>
<p>(Both Germany and Poland are preparing for war over the Danzig issue, and the Polish army has become one of the key issues in Europe. Colonel Eliot, a famous writer of the book "The Fortresses We Saw," recently inspected Poland's military strength with an expert's eye. The following article was written specifically for Continental Daily News. — Continental Daily News Editor)</p>
<p>Nazi Invasion</p>
<p>If its ultimate goal is Poland, how will the forces of Britain or France assist Poland? This can be answered by attacking Germany's western border. However, this move may be slow to progress, and it may not be enough to provide Poland with the greatest help in the end. Because the Polish Air Force is weak, and there are few important targets that can be bombed, most of the German Air Force can focus on</p>
<p>Attacking Britain and France</p>
<p>Destroying their domestic defenses, breaking up their military mobilization, concentration, and advancement. It is conceivable that even if the French army receives a steady stream of reinforcements from the British army and can effectively threaten any vital interests of Germany, Poland may still be completely defeated. However, this does not mean that Germany can defeat Poland without suffering losses. The Polish army has thirty divisions, plus one cavalry division with twelve brigades, and several other units. The Polish western border has no natural defensive positions except for the Vistula River. However, there are some fortresses in certain locations. The Polish army is trained for mobile warfare, and its human nature is also excellent. There are now enough trained reserves to increase the strength of standing army divisions to wartime strength, and theoretically, many reserve divisions can be formed. However, it is doubtful whether reserve divisions have the weapons needed to equip them. Poland is severely lacking in medium-sized artillery, heavy artillery, and large tanks. Its industry cannot cope with the task of maintaining a large army. Most of the country is agricultural, and the number and capacity of railways are insufficient, and the roads are extremely poor. However, once the German army invades, the poor road conditions will be a major obstacle for the German army. Germany previously only maintained one cavalry brigade (stationed in East Prussia), but last year, it began to form several cavalry divisions. This clearly shows that Germany understands the difficulties of mechanized troops in countries with damaged roads. Judging from all the circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the German army's</p>
<p>Invasion of Poland</p>
<p>And its continued advance will be slow. If the Soviet Union is very likely to reinforce the Polish army with military supplies and weapons, then the Polish army will continue to support until winter comes and large-scale military operations in Eastern Europe stop. If so, the German army must resume fighting in the east in the spring and send more troops to the west to resist the British and French breakthroughs. Germany's situation cannot sustain a long war. The current shortage of food and essential raw materials is already difficult to bear in peacetime, and it will lose its combat capability in wartime. The resources that can be used by the alliance of France, Britain, and Poland are far thicker than those of Germany, and its sources for obtaining foreign supplies are almost unlimited, while Germany's supply sources are very small.</p>
<p>Italy's Attitude Toward This</p>
<p>It is also unable to assist Germany. Even if Italy participates in the war (which is by no means certain), it will likely participate economically first, and soon it will also take military action. On the other hand, Romania and Yugoslavia will likely see fighting for Poland as fighting for their own two countries. The participation of these two countries may be extremely difficult, and Yugoslavia is likely the most difficult. However, from the viewpoint of Britain and France, they are especially unwilling to have a prolonged European war. This observation is likely quite accurate. The terrible destruction and massacres that London and Paris will suffer alone are enough to make the British and French governments hesitant, as they were before the Great War. If Germany maintains its domestic front, then Britain and France must make great efforts, or efforts equal to those of the previous Great War, in order to overcome Germany, and the sacrifices will leave deep scars on the social and economic institutions of the countries involved. Even air raids on British and French civilians may be decisive. In short, Germany's opportunity must be that air raids are indeed decisive and can be carried out quickly. Regardless of whether or not Italy assists, we will</p>
<p>Eventually Be Defeated</p>
<p>Due to the abundance of resources of Britain, France, etc. However, what will be the state of the victors when they win? Therefore, the recent declaration issued by the British government regarding Poland can be seen as an unpleasant omen for Germany and an attempt to make its rulers stop there. Germany has been able to annex neighboring countries piecemeal for a long time without taking the great risk of war, while gaining new strongholds, sources, and raw materials, and its reputation of terror has repeatedly expanded outwards from its borders. It is predicted that it may take this path. Germany's progress may make it so strong that neither the East nor the West will be a match for it one day. London took a long time to finally ascertain this decisive fact, and now it understands it. This is fully demonstrated by the astonishing change in British policy contained in Chamberlain's speech.</p>
<h3>Yixing County Town Falls Again, City Full of Desolation, Many Puppet Organizations Destroyed</h3>
<p>Yixing Correspondence: The Nationalist army has been counterattacking Yixing city for over a month, and once charged into the city. However, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they retreated to the mountains and attacked from time to time. As a result of this war, the Heqiao puppet township office, the puppet anti-smoking bureau, and the puppet police station were all destroyed by the Chinese army, and nine puppet officials were captured. The roadbed from Heqiao to the city was destroyed. After Yixing city was reoccupied by the Japanese army, the puppet magistrate Qi Licheng also returned to the city. The Japanese army initially wanted to demolish the houses outside the city, but after [Qi's] earnest plea, the Japanese army headquarters temporarily suspended the demolition. However, the doors and windows of vacant houses must be blocked, and iron sheds will be built at the Dongcang Bridge to prevent guerrillas. These measures have been carried out. However, the city is full of desolation. [Qi] is trying his best to attract people to return in order to prettify the situation, and is also handling the sale of cheap rice, eight cents per liter, with a limit of three liters per person, to lure a group of poor people.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Advance Army Attacks Lujia, Both Sides Engage in Two Battles, Japanese Army Suffers Many Casualties</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Shazhou area at the junction of Jiangyin, Changshu, and Nantong counties has a vast area and abundant production. The puppet organization has established a puppet maintenance association in the area, with Qu Chongguang, a rogue from Changshu, as the puppet chairman, and the Japanese army headquarters has dispatched more than 100 Japanese soldiers to station in the Luyuan area for deterrence. Qu, seeing that the puppet maintenance association is facing financial difficulties, has a whimsical idea and decides to collect land tax, six jiao per mu, with an estimated collection of about 100,000 yuan. However, since the collection began, the people have been hesitant to pay. Therefore, Qu requested the Japanese army headquarters to detain farmers, which happens several times a day. Cai Runqi, the commander of the Jiangnan Advance Team and concurrently the magistrate of Changshu County, who was stationed in that area, led a team to Yuelai Town in the Jiangyin border area on the 12th and contacted the regular army XXX Division to attack the Japanese army in Luyuan. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered 960 casualties and fled in panic. The next morning (the 14th), before dawn, the Japanese army mobilized reinforcements of 5600 people from the four counties of Nantong, Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Changshu, carrying small steel cannons, and surrounded Cai's troops in four routes. Cai's troops and the regular army had made preparations in advance, calmly responded, and repelled the Japanese army again. The Japanese army suffered dozens more casualties, and Cai's troops also suffered casualties. Company Commander Ye Houbo took the lead and made a heroic sacrifice. Later, Cai's troops, seeing that the mission had been accomplished, had already retreated with the regular army to XXX safe area.</p>
<h3>Jiangdu Standing Army's Bravery in Charging into the Japanese Camp, Killing Japanese Army Captain Takeda, Also Killing More Than Twenty Japanese Puppet Soldiers, Chinese Army Triumphs with Spoils of War</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: Tao Shouming, the commander of the 3rd Company of the Jiangdu County Government Standing Army, received a secret order from County Magistrate Zhang the other day to attack the Japanese puppet army stationed at Huojia Bridge. Therefore, on the night of the 20th of this month, he led the platoon leader Li Xuewen and 80 soldiers, crossed two rivers, and lurked around the area. Almost until late at night, they began to attack the camp. At that time, the Japanese puppet army had already fallen asleep. It was not until Tao captured the sentry puppet soldiers and broke into the room that they were awakened. Lieutenant Takeda, the commander of the Japanese army squad, hurriedly got up and fought back with his command knife. One of Tao's soldiers was hit by the knife and his body was split in two. More than a dozen other soldiers still bravely stepped forward, hoping to capture Takeda alive. They engaged in hand-to-hand combat with eight or nine Japanese soldiers and more than ten puppet soldiers for two hours. Takeda and all the other Japanese puppet soldiers, more than twenty people in total, were killed. Tao's platoon leader Li Xuewen was injured, and three soldiers were killed and several injured. In total, they seized more than a dozen rifles and carbines, 1,400 rounds of ammunition, and two steel helmets. Takeda was fully armed. Tao's troops originally planned to drag Takeda's body back, but the Japanese army stationed at Shejiaban had heard the news and came by speedboat. Captain Tao feared that the river would be blocked by them, and Yangzhou city was only more than ten li away, with a direct road. In order to avoid being cut off, he hurriedly took the spoils of war and the four captured puppet soldiers and traitors and withdrew. Takeda's body and the bodies of the soldiers who died in Tao's unit were not taken away. The soldiers were covered in blood and returned safely to the defense. The injured platoon leader was also sent to a certain place for treatment. When Tao's troops were marching in triumph through XXX, the headquarters of the New Fourth Army stationed there lined up to show their welcome.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Puppet County Government Exploits Tenant Farmers, More Than 100 Farmers Arrested</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Wu County puppet county government, due to a shortage of funds and huge expenses, tried its best to exploit the people. Last winter, it established a puppet "Rent and Tax Collection Bureau" to collect land tax. According to calculations, it has collected more than 400,000 yuan so far. However, the situation has recently become bleak. Only three puppet branch bureaus remain: Mudu, Guangfu, and Chenmu. Villagers who owe taxes have repeatedly asked the puppet police to arrest them and detain them in Mujia Garden, with a total of more than 180 men and women. On the night of the 16th of this month, 66 people escaped. Three days ago, a farmer, Hua Lushi, died of a sudden illness. The detained farmers caused a great disturbance. The puppet branch bureaus in Weiting, Hengjing, etc., were repeatedly destroyed by mobile teams, and puppet officials were killed. The puppet headquarters has had nothing to do in recent days. A group of puppet officials are sitting and receiving salaries. The families of the puppet official He Shaolin, etc., who were killed the other day, requested compensation. The puppet officials discussed it, but there has been no result.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong University President Schloesser's Broadcast Impressions of Chongqing: Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Planes, Rapid Progress in Various Constructions</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) When Hong Kong University President Schloesser was previously in Chongqing, he was invited by the Central Broadcasting Station to give a speech in English titled "Impressions of a Trip to Chongqing." It was broadcast to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia on the 25th and 26th of the month. A summary of his words is as follows: My impressions of this trip to Chongqing are excellent, and I will tell you all about them in five points: (1) There is an atmosphere of optimism here. All residents are aware of the importance of their responsibilities, work intensely, have serious attitudes, and possess a spirit of perseverance. (2) Viewing the map of the bombed areas proves that the Japanese planes bombed indiscriminately. The result of the crazy bombing is numerous civilian casualties. However, the city's rescue work is progressing very quickly, and the public is very calm. (3) Various constructions are progressing rapidly. The current government is starting to organize skilled technicians into small industrial groups. These groups are not only for the current needs but will also benefit the rural economy during the war. Therefore, looking to the future, China's countryside will inevitably become more developed. (4) Central University moved from Nanjing to Chongqing and completed the construction of the school buildings in "thirty-two" days. The faculty and students are very happy and healthy. These people are the talents of the new era for various constructions. After this arduous training, the excellence of their quality can be imagined. (5) The deepest impression is the image of the great leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. His personality is unparalleled in the world. His talent and intelligence surpass both Caesar and Augustus. His remarkable spirit of struggling to maintain national survival and protect world peace will never be forgotten. Madame Chiang's efforts to assist in the war of resistance and national construction are also admired by the world. (27th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Post-Disaster Work</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, Chinese soldiers began digging up unexploded bombs dropped by Japanese planes on Thursday night. All places with unexploded bombs are roped off. Three soldiers with shovels and other tools are digging about four feet from the bombs. However, the soldiers carrying out this work are very careful when digging, and do not dare to use force, for fear that the shovels and other tools may accidentally touch the bombs and cause an explosion. At present, there are at least fifteen such unexploded bombs in the city. Furthermore, the defending soldiers in the city and the soldiers in the outer areas are cooperating to clear all debris from the streets. They are also working hard to build more fire lanes and destroy all broken walls and ruins to prevent Japanese planes from bombing again in the future. Workers are working all day today to repair the water pipes, as the pipes in the lower parts of the city have been damaged, and the people living there have been without water for two days. Furthermore, according to Chinese officials, this bombing has led people to automatically join training camps. In the past week, more than 600 men and women have participated in training camps near Chongqing, and more people will join in the future. Ninety-two women who have lost their jobs or been separated from their families due to the Japanese bombing have decided to abandon their luxurious fashions and high-heeled shoes and join volunteer teams to serve the country. Also, two Taoist priests cut off the long hair coiled on their heads and took off their Taoist robes, replacing them with military uniforms and hats. According to them, they believe that the Taoist saying, "You should not kill," cannot be applied in this war. (27th dispatch from the American Associated Press)</p>

<h3>China Communications Bank Opens Small Loan Business</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, according to Chinese financial circles, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are now opening small loans.

Those who borrow money to purchase goods must repay the loan to the bank within three months. However, if the loan is used to purchase machinery and equipment, it can be repaid within six months. The two banks have set aside 400,000 yuan specifically for lending to general refugees to revive their businesses. The amount borrowed by vendors shall not exceed 30 yuan per person, while small shop owners or small factory owners can borrow 300 to 500 yuan from one of the above two banks for the purchase of equipment. The National Relief Commission, the Municipal Government, the Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, and other organizations are responsible for approving the various loan applications.

<h3>Latest News: Japanese Consul Miura Returns to Shanghai, Insisting on Demands for Reform of the Concessions</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, returned to Shanghai from Tokyo yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the Shanghai Maru. Yesterday afternoon, Miura met with visiting journalists and explained that Japan's demand for fundamental reform of the administrative system of the Public Concession is a reasonable and legitimate move. If the powers still ignore it, a "sad situation" will be seen in the concession, causing great inconvenience to millions of residents. Miura firmly stated his determination to continue negotiations to achieve Japan's goals, saying that it is unreasonable to ignore reasonable and legitimate demands made by Japan in a reasonable and legitimate manner. He believes that the consuls of the United States, Britain, and France stationed in Shanghai are all very rational, so he intends to continue negotiations with them to clear the air in the concession. He believes that they should know that refusing to negotiate with him is tantamount to the concession losing an insurance door. The current system in the concession that grants political rights based on industry is unique in the world. Japan's demands may make the concession more democratic. It would be irrational for a democratic country to refuse.</p>

<h3>French Mail Ship Blocked by Japanese Army; French Government Lodges Protest; Commander of French Fleet in China Instructed to Protest to Japanese Naval Authorities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Paris, 27th (Associated Press) - The French government yesterday instructed Vice Admiral Cox, commander of the French fleet in China, to protest to the Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai regarding the detention of the French mail ship Aramis on Wednesday afternoon. The Aramis arrived in Shanghai yesterday with Vice Admiral Cox on board. The French government is also considering the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coastline, but what final position France will take can only be decided after an official meeting with Britain. According to French sources, the British authorities have stated that regardless of the Japanese declaration that "this is not a matter of rights, but what Japan demands," they have firmly determined to exercise Britain's rights in the Far East.</p>
<p>Coolidge Ship Not Obstructed</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 27th (Associated Press) - The President Coolidge sailed into Hong Kong from Shanghai this morning. Although it passed through the blockade line set up by the Japanese navy along the Chinese coast, the ship was not interfered with by the Japanese navy. The authorities in Washington are closely monitoring the ship's journey to determine what attitude the Japanese navy will take towards American ships sailing in Chinese territorial waters after the announcement of the blockade of the Chinese coast. The fact that the President Coolidge was able to sail unhindered after several British and French mail ships along the Chinese coast were detained by the Japanese this week shows that Japan is still implementing its original policy, that is, not to offend the United States. Observers recalled that a spokesman for the Japanese navy in Shanghai once declared that when implementing the blockade, the Japanese side would not send ships to escort American ships.</p>
<p>United States Closely Watching</p>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) - The attitude of the Japanese navy towards foreign merchant ships along the Chinese coast is being closely monitored by the State Department. So far, no American merchant ships have been intercepted. According to observers close to the State Department, the government will still closely monitor the development of the situation, but it is not convenient to participate in the retaliatory measures that Britain and France may take for the time being. As for Japan's implementation of the blockade of the Chinese coast, the State Department has not received any information that can be trusted. It is also not true that the British government has consulted with the United States on how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>New York, 26th (Havas) - The New York Public Opinion Forum recently commented harshly on the Japanese warships inspecting the nationality of British and French merchant ships in Chinese waters, saying, "Japan strictly abides by all treaties and laws that are beneficial to Japan, fearing that it will not be strong enough. Those that hinder the country are regarded as worthless and trampled on. As for the remarks made by Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kawasai regarding the country's warships' actions, it can be seen that the country's naval authorities have been allowed to report that the country's relations with various countries are only based on how it needs to be transferred. Kawasai has already stated to Europeans and Americans in China that Japan hopes to cause major disputes. Why should the United States and other countries provide money to help Japan run industry and commerce? This is really puzzling."</p>
<p>French Ship Blocked En Route</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the captain of the French Huamei mail ship Aramis, Remy, and the commander of the French fleet in China, Admiral Cox, had a long meeting last night (the 26th) regarding the Japanese army boarding the passenger ship off the coast of Hong Kong on Wednesday afternoon. No official statement was issued after the meeting. However, it is heard from reliable sources that France will lodge a protest in the near future or today (the 27th). It is heard that Captain Remy has reported in detail on what happened after the Japanese army boarded the ship.</p>
<p>Detailed Report</p>
<p>Although officials did not announce the admiral's report yesterday, reporters have obtained accurate details of the matter from reliable sources. When the Aramis was sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai, it was stopped half a mile off the coast of Hong Kong. A 5,000-ton Japanese light cruiser was anchored off the coast of Hong Kong, apparently waiting for the French ship to arrive. When the Japanese ship saw the French ship, it used a foghorn to signal Captain Remy to stop. Captain Remy, fearing being shot, immediately stopped the ship. The Japanese ship then launched a boat with two officers and two soldiers and a bugler, all armed with rifles. The boat headed towards the Aramis. Captain Remy ordered a rope ladder to be lowered, and the Japanese soldiers climbed up the ladder. This is what reporters who met with eyewitnesses yesterday said. It was also said that when the bugler was climbing the ladder, his bugle and rifle were tangled in the rope ladder. The eyewitnesses all held their breath and watched, seeing the soldier almost lose his balance and fall into the sea. After they boarded the ship, the two sailors and the bugler stationed themselves on the deck. The two officers then handed the captain printed sheets of paper with various questions on them. These questions were written in</p>
<p>English</p>
<p>for filling in, because the two officers spoke very broken English and did not understand French. The five people who boarded the ship did not bring a translator, so the conversation between the Japanese officers and Captain Remy was slow and very difficult. The main question on the paper was about the Aramis's boarding certificate. The Japanese officers wanted to see this certificate. Captain Remy answered this question, telling the Japanese officers to look at the ship's flag, but still showed the registration certificate printed in French. The Japanese officers</p>
<p>Took It and Looked Closely</p>
<p>at it, but did not show any sign that they understood what they were reading. The conversation between the captain and the Japanese officers lasted an hour. The five who boarded the ship then left the ship and returned to the cruiser. The Aramis then continued to sail to Shanghai. At the same time, Captain Remy sent a message to Admiral Cox in Xiamen and the French authorities in Shanghai, reporting that when the Japanese soldiers boarded the ship, the passengers on board were</p>
<p>Drinking Coffee</p>
<p>on the deck. According to them, the Japanese soldiers did not attempt to carry out any kind of inspection. It is heard that the admiral was attending negotiations in Gulangyu between the Japanese troops stationed there and the naval authorities of Britain, France, and the United States. After receiving the telegram sent by Captain Remy, he set off from Gulangyu and took the flagship Queret to Shanghai, arriving yesterday. Soon after landing, he met with the French Ambassador to China, Gossmer, reportedly to discuss the Japanese soldiers boarding the Aramis, but no statement was issued.</p>
<p>Japanese Side's Remarks Persist in Preconceptions</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that a Japanese navy spokesman previously stated that the Japanese navy, in principle, reserves the right to stop any ship, large or small, flying any flag, navigating along the Chinese coast. At yesterday's reception for reporters, foreign reporters again asked about the above statement. One asked whether the Japanese naval authorities retain the right to inspect third-country ships navigating along the Chinese coast. The spokesman replied that, in principle, the Japanese naval authorities will only investigate</p>
<p>Ship Identity</p>
<p>At the same time, whether to inspect the ship will depend on the situation. One asked what the difference is between a blockade and the right to inspect. The spokesman said that now navigation to China is being blockaded. Another reporter said that stopping foreign passenger or cargo ships outside the 12-mile limit could be interpreted as an act of war or piracy. The spokesman replied that the Japanese naval authorities have the</p>
<p>Right to Obtain</p>
<p>satisfactory proof of nationality, which has been practiced for two years. Regarding the fact that officers and sailors of the British shipping company's mail ship Langpula boarded the ship when it entered Hong Kong on Wednesday, one reporter said that Hong Kong is a British colony. The spokesman replied that Hong Kong is on the Chinese coast and within the enemy zone. He also said that France has not protested about boarding the French mail ship Aramis on the same day under similar circumstances.</p>
<h3>Sounds of Anti-Aircraft Guns Heard in Jiangwan; Japanese Side Says Soldiers Fired Blanks Due to Hot Weather</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the citizens of Shanghai were awakened yesterday morning (the 26th) by the heavy anti-aircraft gunfire coming from the Jiangwan area, reminding those who heard it of the day in 1937 when Chinese planes attacked the Shanghai area. However, according to the Japanese side, there were no Chinese planes attacking yesterday morning. This statement was somewhat confirmed by foreigners observing in the streets when the gunfire first started at 5:00 AM, as there were no planes visible in the vicinity. However, the Japanese side has its own explanation. A Japanese spokesman replied to an inquiry about this matter yesterday, saying that because the weather was hot, we were afraid that the Japanese soldiers would not be able to endure it, so we gave them some blank shells and allowed them to fire them.</p>

<h3>Large Investors Manipulate; Rice Prices Rise Again Yesterday; Buyers and Sellers Uncertain, Changes Abound; Source Continues Uninterrupted, Inventory Growing</h3>
<p>As various places have successively lifted restrictions, the source of domestic rice has suddenly increased, causing prices to fall sharply. In addition, as the weather has turned hot, hoarders are eager to sell, and the market has an oversupply of spot goods. However, yesterday morning, due to large investors manipulating the rice market, market prices rose again. However, sources from various places are still coming in an endless stream, and there is no doubt that Shanghai's food supply can be guaranteed. Various gang purchasing merchants have already reported the process of purchasing rice and grain to various rice industry groups. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Large Investors Intervene</p>
<p>The stock of rice in this city is indeed growing, enough to meet the needs of three months. The market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning and closed at 12:00 PM. However, large investors suddenly intervened in large quantities to manipulate the market. Although the market is full of spot goods and supply and demand can be met, sellers are intent on hoarding, so prices have risen by two or three corners compared to the previous day. The opening price for top-grade white rice was 17 yuan and 5 corners, and middle and lower grades of rice also rose. Later, the transaction price was 10 yuan and 4 corners. Because transactions are constantly changing, buyers and sellers are uncertain. The market traded about 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Land and Water Transport to Shanghai Continues Uninterrupted</p>
<p>Recently, the source of domestic rice from various places has gradually increased. Frequent rumors that local authorities are still banning the export of rice and grain and increasing exorbitant taxes. However, trucks and wheelbarrows from various places are still transporting goods to Shanghai in an endless stream, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing. This is a normal situation, depending on the size of the transaction volume in the producing area. Yesterday, the source was slightly scarce, with trucks and wheelbarrows transporting more than 3,000 bags, and more than 1,000 bags arriving from the river. As for the first batch of Saigon foreign rice, it will be shipped soon, loaded on ships to regulate the Shanghai market. It is expected that the stock of rice in Shanghai will become increasingly abundant.</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang Talks About the Reasons for Dissolution</p>
<p>Mr. Xing Zhigang, Standing Committee Member of the Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city, said that since this association held price limits in June last year to take care of the food supply of the isolated island, it has been with the understanding of various industries that it has not exceeded the scope. Since May of this year, there have been sudden reports of either banning or easing restrictions on rice production in Jiangsu and Anhui, with rumors flying around. With few sources and rising rice prices, hoarders are even more reluctant to sell, or there are speculators who disregard the food supply and arbitrarily raise prices, causing frequent price increases, which in turn creates an increased tax burden in rice-producing areas, making it unprofitable for transporters and hindering the source, thereby raising rice prices. The Evaluation Committee, seeing that the trend was deteriorating and unable to deal with it, automatically dissolved. This was also a last resort. Now, the authorities in the concession, concerned about the food supply, have repeatedly sent letters to curb speculation and maintain the food supply. People's hearts have stabilized, and market prices are weakening.</p>
<p>Separate Reports on the Purchasing Process</p>
<p>In the past, various gang traders were burdened by exorbitant taxes levied in various rice-producing areas, making it unprofitable. All held a wait-and-see attitude, hesitant to move forward, and the source was scarce, thereby raising rice prices and reducing inventory. Later, various rice industry groups tried their best to dredge the source and strongly urged various gang traders to resume purchasing to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens. Furthermore, as various places such as Wuhu and Changshu successively lifted the ban, the source increased and the inventory became abundant. Now, various gang traders, in addition to mortgaging goods for transportation to Shanghai, also reported the purchasing process and the local conditions in the rice-producing area to various rice industry groups yesterday. It is learned that the source from Changshu, Suzhou, and other places in the south has been blocked again, and there are other reports of bans and increased taxes in various places.</p>
<p>Retail Sales Are Sluggish, Worries Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>According to news from the Rice Shop Association yesterday, retail sales at various large and small rice shops throughout the city were previously hindered by obstructed sources, and market transactions exceeded price limits, causing people to be uneasy and rushing to buy and hoard from various rice shops, resulting in a situation where demand exceeded supply, and for a time, they were overwhelmed. Now, because reports of the lifting of the ban in various places are frequent, inventories are full, rice prices have also fallen, and the market order is gradually becoming regular, so people's hearts have been stabilized, and hidden worries have been eliminated. Therefore, retail sales are becoming sluggish, and as large quantities of foreign rice have already been sold, there is no doubt that the food supply in Shanghai can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Land Subsidence Records Year by Year: Yangshupu Sinks More Than Five Inches in Three Years, Other Places Sink About One Inch Per Year</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that at a meeting of the Civil Engineering Association on May 22, writer and engineer Walterson said in his speech that between February 1934 and June 1937, the area along Yangshupu Road subsided more than five inches, which is the most severe subsidence in the entire Shanghai area. This record was obtained from the Works Department</p>
<p>Level Benchmark</p>
<p>at the corner of Yihua Road and Yangshupu Road. It is believed that the subsidence of the huge warehouses on the north bank of the road is the reason for the change in the benchmark in the area. Similar changes have occurred in other areas of Shanghai. The former Bund benchmark recorded a subsidence of nearly six inches between April 1929 and December 1933, with an average rate of 1.26 inches per year. During the same period, the level benchmark outside the Bund Park recorded a subsidence averaging one-quarter of an inch per year. The subsidence of</p>
<p>Closely Packed Houses</p>
<p>in various points in the Shanghai area ranges from just over one-third of an inch to nearly two inches per year. The classification and analysis of each point is determined according to the size of the adjacent load, the nature of the subsoil (that is, whether it is on an old riverbank), and the possible impact of nearby deep wells. The subsidence on old riverbanks is 90 percent faster than that on non-riverbanks. The speed of land subsidence is directly proportional to the magnitude of the impact of nearby loads and is the result of the absorption of deep wells within a radius of 400 feet.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that British Ambassador Sir Kerr and Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, will arrive in Shanghai on the 1st of the week aboard the British warship Birmingham. It is understood that Ambassador Kerr took the British warship Cornwall to Xiamen to meet with Admiral Noble.</p>
<h3>One-Cent Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>Ying Yongyu from Wenling, Zhejiang, suggested a "one-cent thrift" movement. The donation method is that donations of more than one corner will still be collected by various banks, and receipts will be issued, indicating that the donation is for "one-cent thrift." As for donations of one cent, the association will make a "one-cent thrift disaster relief" donation box, allowing people to put donations into it. Each day, the association will send personnel to open the box together with the persons in charge of various groups or institutions, count the details, and publish the proceeds in various newspapers on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Concern for the Ningbo Bombing Victims; Yin County Government Has Issued Measures to Regulate Food Supply; Merchants with Surplus Grain Ordered to Sell All Stock</h3>
<p>Since the 28th of last month, Ningbo has suffered severe damage from repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft. Upon receiving the news, the highest authority, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was deeply concerned. He specially ordered the Military Supplies Department to remit 50,000 National currency to the Ningbo Defense Commander for relief expenses, and urgently instructed Commander Guo and Commissioner Xu to convey his condolences on his behalf. The original telegram is as follows: "Commander Guo and Commissioner Xu, confidentially: Japanese aircraft are wreaking havoc, and Yin City has suffered repeated and devastating bombings, which deeply concerns me. I have ordered the Military Supplies Department to remit 50,000 yuan in relief funds. I hope you will use them quickly for post-disaster recovery and convey my condolences. Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>Regulating Food Supply</p>
<p>Ningbo has suffered repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft, and many rice merchants have suspended operations due to the destruction of their inventory. This has led to a shortage of rice in the market, and some hoarders and vendors are holding out for higher prices. In order to maintain the food supply, the Yin County Government, in addition to ordering the Ningbo Food Transport and Sales Company to expand its sources as much as possible, has also established the following remedial measures to regulate food supply:</p>
<p>Remedial Measures</p>
<p>(1) The transport and sale of food by residents and rice merchants in all townships and towns of this county shall be governed by these measures, unless otherwise provided by law. (2) Township and town offices, rice merchant associations, and rice shop associations shall thoroughly investigate and verify the actual amount of rice stored by major households (including charitable estates and public granaries) and all rice merchants and factories within their jurisdiction, and register them separately. If a household stores its rice in several locations, all locations must be investigated and registered without omission.</p>
<p>Reserved Quota</p>
<p>(3) After the amount of grain stored by major households has been investigated and registered, in addition to allowing each household to reserve the amount needed for its own consumption until the new rice crop is harvested, the remaining amount shall be ordered to be sold in its entirety. (4) After the amount of rice currently milled by rice merchants, factories, and warehouses has been investigated and registered, the relevant trade associations shall supervise them to sell it at any time, and hoarding shall not be allowed under any pretext.</p>
<p>Two Meals a Day</p>
<p>(5) Each township and town shall persuade residents to vigorously promote the improvement of brown rice and advocate two light rice porridge meals, one in the morning and one in the evening, and prohibit the use of rice for making cakes, candies, and other items in order to reduce consumption. (6) All rice merchant associations shall supervise rice merchants, factories, and warehouses to not mill or mill refined rice for customers for sale. (7) If any major household or rice merchant underreports or conceals stored rice, and the investigation proves it to be true, in addition to presenting it to the county for approval to sell the stored grain at a fair price, the government will also impose penalties in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Strict Reporting</p>
<p>(8) If any hoarding household or rice merchant deliberately conceals stored grain and fails to report it, the public is allowed to report it to the government, and 20% of the fine imposed on the case by the government will be used to reward the informant. (9) Supervisors from each township and town office and rice merchant association who fail to conduct accurate surveys of stored grain or deliberately underreport it will be treated as accomplices in concealment. (10) Except for townships and towns with special grain shortages that may request assistance from the Food Transport and Sales Company in accordance with the government's Order No. 310 of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, townships with a sharp increase in population and insufficient food distribution shall first purchase food from the amount of rice within the township or town before requesting supply from the Brown Rice Transport and Sales Company. (11) These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>The Sino-American Daily News Allowed to Resume Publication</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Mr. Stegert, chairman of the Sino-American Daily News, a Chinese-language newspaper owned by an American company, has reportedly received a certificate from Mr. Philip, the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, allowing the morning edition of the newspaper to be published from June 1. The Sino-American Daily News, along with the Da Mei Bao, Wenhui Bao, and Translation News, were suspended on May 18 for publishing a verbatim transcript of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech in Chongqing. British newspapers received notice from the British Consulate General that their suspension would last two weeks. However, the notices received by the two American-owned newspapers regarding the suspension period were quite ambiguous. Yesterday, the Sino-American Daily News received its certificate, but the Da Mei Bao had not received such notice as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Incident of British Sentry Injuring Someone; British Military Finds No Evidence; Japanese Navy Denies Lodging a Protest, Only Says It May Prepare to Do So</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, sources learned last night (26th) that a thorough investigation by the British military authorities in Shanghai has yielded no evidence to substantiate the claims made by a Japanese Navy spokesperson two days ago regarding the actions of a British sentry from the Xifu Zi Highland Detachment. The Japanese Navy spokesperson claimed that on Wednesday, an officer from the Japanese Navy Marines in Pudong went to the Lun Chang Textile Factory to meet with the commander of the British troops stationed at the Xifu Zi Highland Detachment, but was stabbed in the right hand by a British sentry with a rifle. Subsequently, both the Tokyo and Shanghai branches of the Domei News Agency officially claimed that a protest had been lodged with the British military authorities in Shanghai regarding this matter. However, when the Japanese Navy spokesperson met with reporters yesterday, he denied that a protest had been lodged, claiming that one was perhaps being prepared and would be submitted to the British military authorities when completed.</p>
<h3>Two British Ships Sailing to Hankou Completely Under the Control of the British Navy; the Two Ships Will Transport Crew Members with Completed Terms Back to Shanghai; Foreigners Must Have Japanese Permits to Board</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily News, a representative from the British Consulate stated to reporters yesterday (the 27th) that after consultations between the British and Japanese naval authorities in Shanghai, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s SS Suiwo and the Taikoo &amp; Co.'s SS Wuhu would soon leave Shanghai for Hankou. The main purpose of this voyage is to transport half of the crew members from British gunboats on the Yangtze River whose terms have expired downriver to Shanghai. After the SS Suiwo arrives in Hankou, it will only make a brief stop before departing the port. However, the SS Wuhu will remain in Hankou and replace the SS Wuling (transliteration), which has been trapped there for several months. The SS Wuling will then carry the sailors whose terms have expired back to Shanghai with the SS Suiwo. It is understood that the voyages of the SS Suiwo and SS Wuhu to Hankou are only for cargo ship purposes. The British government has leased their cabins to transport personnel, so the two ships are not solely controlled by the British government. However, according to the arrangements agreed upon with the Japanese authorities, they will be completely under the control of the British naval authorities. The Japanese authorities have stated that they will issue permits to certain types of civilians and agree that those who have such permits may board the two ships. The British Consulate authorities are currently consulting with the Japanese side regarding the issuance of permits to certain people, and have already submitted their names to the Japanese side. Passengers are not limited to British nationals; any foreigner who wishes to travel must have their names reported by their own consulate and obtain a permit from the Japanese side. The two ships will not carry cargo, only personal belongings and items that cannot be obtained in Hankou will be allowed on board.</p>
<h3>US Ship Marblehead to Sail to Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the US cruiser Marblehead departed from Xiamen and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of Monday, docking at pontoons number 14 and 15. The exact time of arrival in Shanghai is unknown. The Marblehead sailed from Qingdao to Xiamen when the Gulangyu incident occurred, and dispatched 42 sailors to land on Gulangyu. This decision to come to Shanghai is only for a few days of docking, and it is scheduled to sail north on June 1, possibly joining the ships of the US Asiatic Fleet in Qingdao.</p>

<h3>Litigant Uses Sound Recording Method to Collect Opponent's Confession; Creates a Record to Submit as Affirmative Evidence; Trial Judge Listens to Both Sides' Testimony on the Record; Listeners Are All Surprised; Court Orders Postponement for Confrontation</h3>
<p>As science advances, the methods by which litigants gather evidence are also advancing. Judge Jia Xiaoke of the Civil Division of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon at 3:20 pm, was hearing a case in the Seventh Civil Court of the Court regarding the return of a security deposit and breach of contract. The plaintiff presented a record, claiming that it contained a confession obtained by recording a phone call from the defendant's side, which could serve as affirmative evidence. Those in attendance were surprised by this. The case's circumstances are complex. The details are as follows: A man named Cao Wenyu from Pudong, residing at 55 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, previously ran the Huizhong Company. In March of last year, he entered into a wheat sales contract with Cai Xiaodi, also from his hometown. Cao claimed to have 20,000 bags of wheat in Chuzhou, and it was agreed that the price would be 7 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 fen, and 5 li per bag, to be sold entirely to Cai. At the time of the contract, Cai paid Cao an initial deposit of 10,600 yuan. Cao also declared to Cai that if the statement was false, he was willing to pay double the compensation. Later, Cao delayed delivery and only gradually returned 6,400 yuan of Cai's security deposit, still owing 4,200 yuan, which he has yet to return. As for the 8,000 yuan breach of contract payment, he ignored it altogether. Therefore, Cai hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting that Cao be ordered to return the 4,200 yuan security deposit and compensate the 8,000 yuan breach of contract payment. After the case occurred, Cao hired a lawyer to present a settlement agreement to the court, claiming that it had been fully resolved in July of last year. Since Cai had not entered into a settlement agreement, he contacted a sound recording company to obtain Cao's confession over the phone. At around 7 pm on the evening of the 25th of this month, Cai called Cao and said that Cao's stealing his seal and forging the settlement agreement was an immoral act. Cao's reply in the phone call was roughly that stealing Cai's seal was only used on the settlement agreement, and it was not used elsewhere, and this decision was made out of necessity. After obtaining Cao's confession, Cai immediately made a record. At 3:20 pm yesterday afternoon, it was presented to the court. Judge Wu Laoke of the trial court, in court, opened the phonograph and put the record on the phonograph, and listened to Cai's conversation with Cao on the phone. Judge Wu listened to the testimonies of both Cai and Cao through the phonograph. Cao's proxy lawyer immediately rose and stated that the voice on the record was not Cao's. The lawyer could not determine whether it was really Cao's voice, and the party concerned was not present today, so he asked the court to study the record in detail. Then, Xu Jinyu, acting as Cai Xiaodi's lawyer, explained the meaning of the words on the record to the court, because both Cai and Cao spoke the Pudong dialect, not Mandarin. After Xu explained the meaning of the record, he said that he would file another case against Cao for stealing the seal and forging documents. The reason why Cao had the opportunity to steal Cai's seal was because Cao and Cai were cousins, and although there was a lawsuit, the two sides still often communicated with each other. After verifying the wording, because it was necessary to have Cao Wenyu confront the record, the court then ordered a postponement until June 14 at 10 am for another hearing, and ordered the plaintiff Cai Xiaodi to bring the record and phonograph to the court for confrontation. After the court adjourned, those who were in attendance said that this was a new record of obtaining evidence, and in the future, one must be careful when speaking on the phone.</p>
<h3>Brothel Guides Detained; Substantial Fines Imposed Everywhere</h3>
<p>Fang Teerhua, a Chinese detective in the flower tax section of the Public Concession Police, badge number 1013 on 3rd Road, has recently been arresting brothel guides who illegally set up branches in major hotels in various hotels, totaling more than 90 people, and sending them to the First Special Court for punishment. The detective and others, at around 9 pm on the afternoon before yesterday, again arrested 14 brothel guides at the Tianchan Brothel Guide Agency, room 608 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. At that time, various brothel guide agencies, such as Yang Guifei and others, were dispatching large numbers of brothel guides to distribute business cards to the rooms in the hotel to solicit business. The detectives arrested these 17 people together, brought them back to the police station, and sent them to the Criminal Prohibition Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. After questioning by the trial judge, they were fined appropriately.</p>
<h3>Two Women and Two Girls Bravely Capture Thieves; Ultimately Bringing Two Bandits to Justice; Police Reward Them</h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, at 8:30 pm, a robbery with weapons occurred in a certain lane on Fuzhou Road, in a certain family's residence. At that time, there were three robbers, one with an automatic pistol and one with a fake pistol, who broke into the house, demanded silence, and robbed the hostess of jewelry and other items. There were also two unarmed robbers waiting outside. During the robbery, the hostess saw that the pistol held by one of the robbers was a fake, and immediately shouted loudly. The robbers, hearing the alarm, tried to escape. The hostess followed and reported to the Chinese police nearby, who captured the robber and found a fake pistol and some stolen goods on him. While the hostess was calling for help, there were also two girls in the house, one ten years old and the other eleven years old, who managed to go out and call two Chinese police officers to come. At that time, one of the armed robbers in the house was wrestling with a woman who lived in the house, and the pistol fell to the ground. The two Chinese police officers captured him on the spot. The arrested robbers were sent to the court for investigation. The bravery of the two ladies and the resourcefulness of the two girls, which ultimately led to the capture of the robbers, are truly commendable. The police gave the two ladies a watch each and the two girls a mechanical pencil each to show their appreciation.</p>
<h3>American Community in Shanghai Holds International Trade Week; Yan Huiqing Speaks on "China as a World Market"; The United States Will Surely Give China Greater Assistance; Close Sino-American Relations in the Last 150 Years</h3>
<p>Every year in late May, the United States must hold International Trade Week. During this week, grand gatherings are held in various places to review the achievements of the past year and decide on future promotion strategies. This year's International Trade Week is scheduled from May 21 to 27. The American community in Shanghai has launched a series of meetings by the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association to host Chinese and American people and welcome students who are about to study in the United States. On the night before yesterday (26th), the American Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Chinese and American people at the Flag Hall on Fuzhou Road to connect emotions.</p>
<p>Sino-American Dignitaries Attend</p>
<p>Those who attended on the American side included Ambassador Johnson, Naval Commander Yarnell, Consul General Gauss, Commercial Counselor Carter, etc. On the Chinese side, there were Yan Huiqing, Shi Zhaoji, Lin Kanghou, Li Ming, etc., totaling more than 300 people. First, Mr. Oberderge, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, gave an opening speech, reporting on greetings from Minister Weng Wenhao and other parties. Then, Ambassador Johnson reported on his recent feelings of returning to the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Huiqing's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Ambassador Yan delivered a speech on "China as a World Market." The general idea was that China is a vast land with abundant resources. In the past, it was the world's largest market, and in the future, it can be determined that it will be the world's largest market. However, there are two important points to pay attention to: (1) China's stability; (2) the development of China's industry. Now, China is in a state of daily insecurity, and industry is not easy to develop. The purchasing power of the Chinese people is inevitably reduced, and international trade is difficult to promote. Sino-American relations have always been harmonious. During this period, the United States will surely give China greater assistance, so that China will gradually move towards stability, and then promote the development of China's industry. As Minister Weng's greetings said, Sino-American cooperation is the foundation for promoting all undertakings.</p>
<p>Report on Trade Conditions</p>
<p>Consul General Gauss reported on Shanghai's commercial situation, and Commercial Counselor Carter reported on the world trade situation. The words were extremely concise, but the meaning was profound. The stability of Shanghai and the world is deeply related, which is an immutable fact. On this day, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Hopkins gave a speech at the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco, broadcasting it wirelessly. However, on the Shanghai side, it was a pity that it could not be transmitted due to temporary interference with radio waves.</p>
<p>Summary of Sino-American Relations</p>
<p>The program of the meeting included a list of Sino-American relations over the past 154 years, which was extremely detailed. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1785 The American merchant ship "Empress of China" first arrived in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>1899 The United States announced the Open Door Policy in China.</p>
<p>1912 The United States was the first to recognize the Republic of China.</p>
<p>1922 The United States initiated the Washington Conference to formulate the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>1928 The United States was the first to recognize China's tariff autonomy.</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily News, the American Chamber of Commerce held a banquet at the American Association last night (26th) to commemorate American National Foreign Trade Week. Mr. O'Bowerger stated at the meeting that one of the most important facts to consider when celebrating Trade Week is to maintain unobstructed trade relations with China. This relationship is important to both countries in terms of culture and material awareness. Mr. O's first invited U.S. Ambassador Johnson, who was in attendance, to speak. Mr. Johnson criticized the benefits that must be attached to Trade Week, recounting the current convenience of global transportation, which makes the people of China and the United States closer. The Ambassador also said that the American people's opposition to isolationism is increasing day by day, mostly due to the fact that the American people are among the most well-informed. The average American now believes that isolation is impossible. Mr. O's then invited Dr. Yan Huiqing, former Chinese ambassador to the United States, to speak. Mr. Yan expressed his gratitude for the American's concern for Chinese students studying in the United States, and said that Sino-American relations are rapidly becoming closer. Mr. Yan mentioned the commercial relations between the two countries, urging that although China has shown a great potential to purchase goods from other countries, China must first be allowed to develop peaceful commerce, thereby giving China the necessary purchasing power. U.S. Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, then rose and said a few words, saying that one of the main tasks of the Navy is to protect merchant shipping. Secondly, the relationship between the U.S. fleet and merchant ships should become an indispensable and important relationship, because the supply of warships must rely on merchant shipping, especially in wartime. U.S. Consul General Gauss spoke about the commercial situation in Shanghai, saying that after 1929, Shanghai's commerce once plummeted, and it fell the most during the most violent Shanghai battles. However, it is currently increasing, and the rate is making observers feel the greatest optimism about the future. The last speaker was Mr. Cardoo, Acting U.S. Commercial Counselor, who asked all American merchants to stay in Shanghai unless the Consul has asked them to leave the factory.</p>

<h3>Truth About the Loud Noise in Nanshi: The Hexing Shipyard Explosion; Three Coolies Killed, Three Seriously Injured; The Factory Did Not Have Any Japanese Troops, So There Were No Casualties</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily News, an explosion occurred at the Hexing (transliteration) Shipyard in Nanshi on Thursday afternoon. The Public Concession and French Concession departments all heard it. It was reported that three coolies were killed in the explosion and two were seriously injured. It was also rumored that the explosion was caused by a team of guerrillas. The building that was bombed was used as an arsenal by the Chinese army before Nanshi fell. The guerrillas believed that there were Japanese soldiers inside, so they detonated it, hoping to kill the Japanese soldiers. Other sources claimed that several Japanese soldiers were also killed in the bombing. However, it was heard that there were no Japanese soldiers or civilians in the building at the time. According to the Shanghai Times, it was confirmed yesterday (26th) that the explosion in Nanshi on the afternoon of the called-for-day occurred at the Hexing Shipyard between the Guoxin (transliteration) and Jiangnan shipyards. Three coolies were picking up discarded iron. The abandoned ship was taken out of the place. At about 3:43 in the afternoon, one of the coolies picked up some discarded iron and threw it into the car. Suddenly, an explosion occurred that could be heard for several miles around. Three coolies were killed on the spot, and three coolies standing further away were seriously injured and had to be taken to the hospital. What caused the explosion is not yet known. Shortly after the explosion, a fire broke out near the area, which was still burning last night. The cause of the fire and the extent of the damage are unknown.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed Occurs in Antong Hotel Early in the Morning; Two Uninvited Guests Open Fire; Xu Zhifu Killed, Gu Ming Seriously Injured; Gu Discovered to Be the Puppet "Yangzhong County Magistrate"</h3>
<p>In the Antong Hotel on Hubei Road (Daxin Street) in the Public Concession, at around 7:40 yesterday morning, an assassination occurred. The victims were Gu Ming (i.e., Gu Chixian), the puppet "Yangzhong County Magistrate," and his entourage Xu Zhifu. Xu died immediately due to injuries to vital organs. Gu Chixian was wounded in the chest and arms and is also in critical condition. The following is an account of what happened: On the 24th of this month, a man who claimed to be Xu Zhifu, who had come from Zhenjiang, along with three men, went to the hotel and asked for a room. The hotel provided them with room 122 on the first floor. At the same time, they moved very simple luggage into the room, and Xu Zhifu wrote "Gu Ming, Xu Zhifu, Merchants" on the registration book. The people in the hotel did not investigate further because they saw that these people looked like merchants. However, they felt that there were a lot of people who visited Xu at the hotel in the past two or three days, but they did not know what they were plotting. Until about 7:00 yesterday morning, the hotel suddenly received a phone call from someone who claimed to be from "Da Zhonghua" and wanted to talk to a Mr. Chen in room 122. At that time, Wang Renquan, the tea waiter on duty, went to notify him. Xu Zhifu came out of the room to answer the phone. Unexpectedly, after a few questions and answers, the phone was suddenly disconnected. Xu Zhifu immediately returned to the room, but he did not know that there were two men dressed in gray suits and gray serge robes guarding the left and right sides of the door. Xu did not notice and waited for Xu to enter the room, then they followed him into the room and immediately took out guns and fired four shots at Gu Chixian and Xu Zhifu. Two bullets hit Xu in vital organs, and he fell to the ground. Two bullets hit Gu in the chest and arms. Seeing that the goal had been achieved, the two men quickly turned around and left the room, escaping from the back door of the hotel. However, when they passed the tea waiter's hall, they told the tea waiter Wang Renquan and others, who were about to run towards them, "Get out of the way, it's none of your business," and left. The tea waiter had no choice but to let them escape. After a while, he went to the room to check and saw that the injured Gu Chixian was still able to stand at the door and try to ask for treatment. Therefore, the tea waiter and others reported to the police station, and a car was dispatched to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Xu Zhifu died soon after due to serious injuries, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office. Gu Chixian has been transferred to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment by the police and is in critical condition. It was only when a puppet title card was found on his body that the matter became clear. Afterwards, the police dispatched detectives to conduct an on-site investigation. As a result, several shell casings were found at the scene of the incident. The two people in room 122 and Wang Yansheng from Wuxi, a traveler in room 218 who was suspected, were also taken to the police station for questioning. According to general rumors, the purpose of Gu and Xu's visit was to control the silk industry.</p>
<h3>Collision Between Two Trains at Tiantong'an Station</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 yesterday afternoon, at the railway gate at the end of North Sichuan Road and Jiangwan Road in Hongkou, south of Tiantong'an Railway Station on the former Songhu Railway, a garbage truck belonging to the Shanghai Municipal Council, while passing over the railway tracks, was unable to move due to its wheels becoming stuck in the tracks. At that time, a Japanese train was heading from the North Station to Wusong, causing the garbage truck to be smashed by the train. The driver had already escaped and survived, but foreman Zeng Keming was unable to jump down and was crushed to death. Afterwards, detectives from the Diswei Road Police Station were dispatched to investigate and sent the body of the deceased to the coroner's office to await an autopsy. It was also reported that at 3:15 pm yesterday afternoon, a Japanese military truck encountered a train running between Wusong and Shanghai while crossing the railway tracks on Tiantong'an Road. The two sides were unable to brake in time, resulting in a violent collision. The entire truck was destroyed, and one Japanese soldier driving the truck was seriously injured. It is understood that the road has had two traffic accidents to date. The first accident involved the car of Lu Ying, the puppet police chief, being destroyed.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Resolved; Old Grievances Forgiven, Living Together Again</h3>
<p>Dong Diqing, a wealthy businessman from Hai Dou, Jiangsu, currently residing at No. 8 Rong He Li, Haig Road, Shanghai West, is 56 years old. His eldest son, Baoquan, passed away due to illness in August of last year, leaving behind a widow, Dong Wang Zhenglan, and an orphaned son, Yonglin, who were being supported by Dong and living together. Subsequently, Dong Wang Weilan, the widow, took her son Yonglin back to Ningbo, residing at No. 9 Weile Garden on the same road, and never returned. Despite Dong's repeated attempts to bring them back, they refused. Therefore, Dong Diqing appointed lawyer Shi Lin to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against his daughter-in-law Dong Wang Weilan and grandson Dong Yonglin, requesting a judgment ordering them to return home and live together. The case was heard once by Judge Chen, and the defendants appointed lawyer Zhao Suxun to appear in court on their behalf to answer the charges. The court ordered a postponement, instructing both parties to mediate outside of court before another hearing. This was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the case has been mediated by both parties and a settlement has been reached. On the 23rd of this month, the plaintiff's in-law, Zhu Jijing, accompanied his daughter Wang Zhenglan and nephew Dong Yonglin back to the plaintiff's home. Old grievances have been forgiven, and they are living together harmoniously as before. Dong Diqing, the plaintiff, yesterday submitted a request to the Special Second Court to withdraw the lawsuit. Thus, a family dispute and a lawsuit involving a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have come to an end.</p>
<h3>Two Women Carrying Opium Soil Sentenced</h3>

They were sent to the Special First Court yesterday morning. Chiang Baolien, the police lawyer, prosecuted them under Article 5 of the Anti-Smoking Law. After questioning by the court and with the defense provided by lawyer Yu Peng, Judge Xiao sentenced Wang Wu Shi to two years and six months of imprisonment and Zhang Yunmei to the same punishment. The opium soil was confiscated.</p>

<h3>The So-Called "Yousuo Pharmaceutical Company" is Actually a Gambling Den, Using the Name to Lure Gamblers; Concession Authorities Will Take Serious Action</h3>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army from Shanghai, the areas outside the boundaries of the Shanghai West Concession, under the protection of special forces, have seen the open establishment of gambling dens and brothels, densely packed together, creating a unique haven of vice. Many ignorant young people and women are lured in, leading to ruin and disgrace, resulting in suicides or becoming thieves, which are too numerous to count. The good order of the Concession is also significantly affected. Recently, the gambling dens have become even more rampant than before, even devising the idea of using the name of a pharmaceutical company to publish large advertisements in newspapers, deceiving readers. The harm to society is not insignificant. The Concession authorities will take serious action. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Using the Name of Pharmaceuticals to Publish Advertisements</p>
<p>Recently, a large advertisement for "Yousheng Pharmaceutical Company" appeared in certain evening newspapers, claiming that the "company's" latest product, "Bear Bile," could "refresh the mind and strengthen the body." In order to promote business, a large sum of money was offered as a prize. A purchase of one dime would receive a coupon, with an open prize draw to welcome visitors, and seeking agents and sales staff. Many readers, not understanding the truth, went to buy the goods or apply as sales staff. But once they arrived at the location, the so-called "pharmaceutical company" turned out to be a blatant gambling den. The den used the issuing of "White Pigeon Tickets" for gambling. The method was similar to flower clubs, with three draws daily. The so-called "agents" and "sales staff" were actually "listeners" and "shipmen." The so-called "Bear Bile" was the "character base" of the eightieth characters in the Thousand Character Classic ("Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow, Universe, Flood, Sun, Moon"). Because the den could not openly advertise in the newspapers, it used the name of a "pharmaceutical company" to deceive the newspapers and lure readers.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>The Public Concession authorities believe that the numerous gambling dens and opium dens in Shanghai West, which are encroaching on the Concession, are significantly harming society and affecting public security. It is heard that the police department has warned all gambling dens to close down voluntarily within a deadline, otherwise, traffic will be blocked and gamblers will be prohibited from entering and exiting. Since the disguised advertisement of "Yousheng Company" was published, the authorities have paid more attention. It is said that they will notify the newspapers to stop publishing such advertisements. At the same time, the newspapers have also realized the trickery and decided to reject them uniformly. It is also learned that although the "company" has published advertisements to lure readers, most people, after learning the truth, have condemned it and have not been fooled. Therefore, "business" remains slow.</p>
<h3>Hoodlum Extorts Illegal Fees, Li Abing Interrogated</h3>
<p>Recently, women Li Xuefei, Zhang Meijun, and Xiao Jiabao, opened a Wang Ying Guidance Agency at No. 127 Yunnan Road. A Shanghai hoodlum named Li Abing and others went to the agency to demand an illegal fee of 20 legal tender yuan, and threatened to cause trouble to prevent them from operating. They negotiated yesterday at room 18 of the First Hotel at No. 275 Zhejiang Road. Li Xuefei and others went as agreed, but Li Abing and others firmly refused to compromise and threatened with violence. Li and the others, unable to pay, made an excuse to go out and reported to the Lao Zha Police Station. Chinese detective Jiang Hongxun rushed there, but the twenty or so hoodlums in room 18 had already dispersed. Subsequently, Li Abing was arrested in room 26. He was sent to the Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolien prosecuted him for extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law. Because accomplices still need to be arrested, he requested permission for a postponement of the interrogation. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he ordered the suspect Li to be detained and the interrogation rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Accidental Firing by Bodyguard in a Building on Fuxing Road, Fracture of Middle Finger, Fortunately No Major Incident; Rumor Has It That the Building Is Wang Jingwei's Private Residence</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the former Deputy Director-General of the Kuomintang Central Committee who was permanently expelled from the party by order of the Central Committee of the National Government in Chongqing, lived in Hanoi, and after surviving an assassination attempt, there were rumors that he had gone abroad to Europe and had once lived in Hongkou. A Western-style house at No. 570 Fuxing Road, at the intersection of Fuli Road in the French Concession, is said to be Mr. Wang's private residence. The house employs more than 20 strong men as bodyguards. Whenever a car enters or leaves, several of these armed guards accompany the car. Wang Changzhi, one of the bodyguards, 31 years old from Shandong, was cleaning his pistol in his bedroom at 4:00 PM on the 26th. After loading the bullets into the gun's barrel, he was cleaning the outside of the gun when he accidentally touched the trigger, causing it to fire. The bullet only broke his right middle finger and fortunately did not injure anyone else. After being injured, Wang sought treatment at the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road. The hospital, as usual, reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate the hospital and the scene of the incident. The report was submitted to the head of the police for review.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Finance Bureau" Refuses to Accept Japanese Currency</h3>
<p>After the drastic fall in the value of Japanese currency, the puppet "Municipal Finance Bureau" also refused to accept Japanese currency. The day before yesterday, personnel from the puppet "Public Utility Bureau's Pudong Office" went to the puppet "Finance Bureau" to deposit 800 yuan, of which 100 yuan was in Japanese currency. The puppet "Bureau" refused to accept it, but fearing retaliation from the Japanese side, they were unwilling to explain the reason for refusing to accept Japanese currency. The puppet "Public Utility Bureau" returned the 100 yuan in Japanese currency and reported it to the puppet "Municipal Government" to study a solution.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter Boatmen at the Bund Pier Attacked Late at Night, Son Zhang Genfu Escapes</h3>
<p>A local woman, Liu Fumei, (also known as Zhu Fumei, due to superstition, she was given to a Liu surname deity, hence the change of surname), 33 years old, her husband Yu Guisheng passed away many years ago, leaving behind a fourteen-year-old daughter. She remarried to Yuan Abao, who also died of illness. Fumei currently lives with her daughter on a boat at Pier 186 on the Bund, making a living by rowing boats. She employs four boatmen. At 12:30 AM yesterday morning, the boat was docked for the night inside the No. 1 and No. 2 Taikoo Pier in the French Concession. Suddenly, a middle-aged man came to the boat's cabin and used a hatchet to violently strike Fumei's head and hands several times, leaving her forehead and other areas bloodied and unrecognizable. Her gold ring on her left hand was also cut open. The fourteen-year-old daughter suffered a minor injury to her arm. Both mother and daughter were injured. The assailant, seeing that his purpose was achieved, went ashore and fled. After the incident, the Customs Water Police sent the two injured persons to Renji Hospital. Because Fumei's injuries were not life-threatening, she is generally not expected to die. It is said that the assailant was an acquaintance named Zhang Genfu. Although the true reason for the attack is not yet known, it is likely due to a love affair.</p>
<h3>Man Shot on Connaught Road Yanping Road, But Missed, Shooter Escapes</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, at the intersection of Connaught Road and Yanping Road, a middle-aged man was walking by when he was suddenly approached by six or seven men wearing mismatched short and long clothing, who emerged from hiding. One of them fired a shot at him, but missed. The man, in danger, immediately ran away, calling for help. The assailants, seeing that their plan had failed and that the incident had been exposed, fled into the darkness. By the time the nearby patrol arrived, there was no trace of them. They accompanied the victim to the police station to report the incident. Whether this case was caused by gambling or was a murder attempt is still unknown. The police are conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
