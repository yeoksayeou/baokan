<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本急欲結束對華戰事的歧路</h3>
<p>最近的日本的一般與論，及官塲斱表示，直言不諱於急謀結束對華戰事。日本侵略中國已歷兩年四個月，除在軍事佔領區域內，掠奪了些浪動資源，毀壞了中國的秩序法紀，，散佈了烟賭等罪惡而外，一無所得；而鉅數人力物力和財力的消耗，却已經搖了他國內經濟社會的基礎。原來日本經濟纔入近代資本主義制度的階段，而天賦所限，祇能注重於輕工業的發展，完全依賴國外留易的維持：可是在這次中日戰爭中，日本政府的所謂戰時措施，根本上就阻塞了這種正常的經濟活動：嚴格的對外貿易統制，徒使輸出入商品數額大减特減，使各種工業的生產能力一再隆低。雖採用了補助費政策，商品連繋制，以及改善貿易行政機關等方法，圖謀振興輸出貿易，並用所謂配給統制來恢復工業的活動；無如不自量力的侵略戰爭之所消耗，決非人力所能補救：例如最近日人宣稱對外貿易好轉，認爲統制政策已經收效；其實日本貿易何常好轉，輸出入數額的增大，貿易差額的轉爲入超，乃是日本商人把大量商品挜銷於獨覇的軍事佔領區域內，再搜刮了軍事佔領區域的各種商品，用軍用票大量換往她的本國，這便是所謂好轉的真相。她向來視爲最重要的歐美及南洋各地市塲，自誇稱雄世界的各種重要商品，無一不是在繼續隆落中。在歐戰發生之後，日本在外交上固然是陷於孤立，在經濟上亦更處於惡劣的地位。對於歐洲及南洋，當然很難維持像過去一般的留易；而美國對於她的所謂遠東新秩序之逐漸採取報復行動，更是日本經濟上一個致命的打撃。她能有多大經濟力量。可以在缺乏外援情况下面，支持長期戰爭，保持國內社會安寧？日本有識之士，恐怕沒有不明瞭的；日昨東報稱元老西園寺現正對日本國內外形勢憂慮，就是一個例證。那麼最近結束對華戰事的宣傳，當是日本人民焦急的呼聲，和內心的要求；至於日本企圖於戰事結束後，趁歐戰機會，發展對外貿易，這不過是附帶的希望罷了。</p>
<p>中日兩國相鄰近，就經濟上言，本來有其彼此密切利賴的關係；苟非日本逞强暴，尤儘有平等合作的可能。不幸日本却妄想滅亡中國，獨霸遠東，遂致鑄成今日的大錯。日本對此大錯還祇是若干有識之士的憂慮，並沒有澈底覺悟；故何時纔得達到他們結束戰事的希望，依然渺茫！這不是中國拖住了打他，中國始終是被動的抗戰；雖受盡日本的茶毒，犧牲了不可計數的生命財產，民間慘痛憤恨，敵愾同仇，但對於日本仍無所求。最近蔣總裁在六中全會致辭，聲明中國的國策始終保持着（一）反對日本侵略，以保障主權領土行政的完整，（二）遵守國際公約，（三）不參加防共協定，（四）外交完全自立自主等四項原則。這是和平的，這是公道的；論情論理，推之天下而皆通的；日本而覺悟，日本而希望結束戰事，理應接受這四項原則。</p>
<p>可惜日本祇有若干有識之士，祇知憂慮而絕不覺悟；他以爲「新秩序」可以騙國際承認，「新政權」可以騙中國和平；一騙再騙　便可騙為併中國，獨霸遠東；其實有良知，有良心的人，誰肯含糊！例如關於所謂新秩序，美國駐日大使格魯氏，很婉轉的說明不受騙，這是明證。而日本却依然以此喃喃自語，刺刺不休。我們以爲倘若認識不足，乃至誤入歧途，這是可惜的。亦是可救的。倘若已經發見騙不了人，而還是大吹大擂，這是騙自己。倘若騙自己而滿不要緊，猶有可說；今則日本在經濟上軍事上俱已不能維持其侵略政策，旣已到了可憂可慮的境界，這種騙自己，即是躭誤了自己！自己躭誤，自食其報，則可憐不足惜。但是我們却希望日本不要到了悔之不及的時候，纔</p>
<h3>英法撤退華北駐軍　美政策不受影響　美國務院否認代英保護權益</h3>
<p>華盛頓　外傳英政府決定撤退華北英軍之後、曾請美國出而保護英國在華利益之消息、今日此間國務院特予否認、並謂、美國在遠東之地位不受英法撤兵行動之影響、（十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　外傳英國將自上海撤退駐軍、此間官塲頃堅決予以否認、斥爲無稽之談、此外天津市日軍對鎮英租界、有更加嚴峻之說、煤斤接濟、聞已斷絕、此間現尙無從予證實、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>天津　今晨英法駐津軍隊尙未開始撤退、外人方面對於英法减少戍兵、而日軍仍沿英法租界對銷之舉、刺激殊深、（十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>天津　素來可靠方面今日聲稱、按照撤退英國駐華大部軍隊計劃、駐紥上海英軍東塞萊隊一隊即將調往天津、以瓜代竇漢隊、東塞萊兵一排將調往北平、保護英國利益、此間軍事當局拒不證實或否認、東塞萊軍隊一連來津消息、彼等拒不表示　漢隊何時離津、凖備撤退之法軍已奉令於三星期內他駛、（十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　關於英國撤退華北駐軍一舉、此間之華盛頓郵報認爲不能以常事視之、但若認英國此項行動之後、即將發生重大之影響、亦爲過甚之辭、蓋英國撤退其華北駐軍雖將產生新問題、但在日本方面未始無問題、一則蘇聯始終爲日本之隱患、二則日本在華之戰事、亦睡於不利之狀態中、因有以上種種理由、故日本與英國皆圖維持友好之關係、又據美國霍華德系各報之外交記者辛蒙士觀察、英國華北駐軍撤退之後、或將使遠東局面、有迅速之變遷、而使美國利益遭受歐戰更直接更鉅大之影響、亦未可知、論及荷蘭擬請美國保護其遠東利益一事、辛蒙士認美國不懂不能擔當此項工作、抑且不願擔負此項工作、良以此項行動、與美國之國策大相逕庭也、（十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　中國外交部喉舌「英文楚報」昨日發一文、摩羯座英國政府關於撤退華北駐軍之決定、表示深懼歐戰延長、英國將有出賣中國之意、該報指陳、英國撤軍之消息、在日本接到之後、極表滿意、幷希望日本加緊對華行動之結果、强迫英国放棄其遠東地位、在中國則難免引起失望、英方所稱撤軍係歐戰所必需之解釋、此間認爲頗難置信、尤其對「維持必要地點之駐軍」、更表懷疑、從前整個英國駐軍駐紥華北、尙不能使天津英僑免於一而再再而三之侮辱、今後僅留一隊一營、而望其保護僑民生命財產、寧非自欺欺人、不問此舉是否即表示英國向日之另一讓步、但中國對英國之遠東政策、自不無憂慮、（十五日海通電）</p>
<h3>英國遠東政策　並無變更　勃特勒答下院間</h3>
<p>倫敦　下議院本日午後開會時、工黨議員倍克、涉及張伯倫首相新近向日本某報訪員所發表之談話、並提出詢問云、此項談話中有數語、是否使人誤解、爲英國對於遠東、業已改變態度、外務部次官勃特勒當即答稱、「談話最後一段、涉及遠東、茲特將原文抄送議員諸君審局關於遠東政策前此所作聲明、亦已列入首相談話之內、於以見吾國之遠東政策、並無變更、此外、美國駐日大使格魯近頃在東京所發表之演說、大要已經發表、哈里法克斯外相擬請倍克君一加檢閱、英國政府未便在此際發表正式聲明」、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英日津案談判　仍在停頓</h3>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲　倫敦特約通信　英帝國踏入戰爭</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>誠然的，英國是不得不戰了。——到了不得不戰的地步，處在不得不戰的境遇，逢到了不得不戰的時機。嚴格地說，現在戰，已經太遲。。失去了一個最有力的同盟者蘇聯，失去了英勇的西班牙的政府軍，失去了奧國，失去了武備精銳的捷克，失去了阿爾巴尼亞。這面的損失，在那面的敵人方面，就是反比例的，力量的增强。這個力量的削弱與增强，在英國，是在道幾個月來的外交邋用上，深切地感到了：過去的，歐洲上次大戰以來的，英帝國在歐洲大陸上傳統主動地位，是在突然之間消滅了。代之而起的，却是除了法國而外，大多數國家對英國的不信任。用通常說法，是所謂「威望一的消逝。因而，在這些時來的英國對外交涉上，就遇到空前未有的棘手情形和一籌莫展，這裏面的苦况，恐怕祇有局中人的英政府當局，方可切實地體會到。照英國當局們的說法，是把這情形，歸過於德·意·反宜傳的所生作用。不過事實勝於雄辯·德·意·宣傳機關屢次預言英國的準備出賣別國利益及對侵略國屈服，到後來，也就像英國預言德·意·的侵略步驟一樣，一一的，都先後實現了！其實，又何待每次的後來事實去證實呢，實際上，即使在最後揭曉以前，在英國，也每次確是充滿了種種活動。這一切的活動，想掩着別人耳目使其一點不知道。是根本不可能，何必定須德·意·宣傳機關的揭露。</p>
<p>德·意·不久前又在預言着英國的出賣波蘭，那時，是在大戰尙未正式爆發的時候。如果英國再不决心作戰，那末，那時的情勢，也是很淸楚的：牠立刻會失去波蘭這一個同盟國。波蘭完了以後，（無論是德·意·的同盟也好，是德·意。的附屬也好，）接下來，就輪到法國的成為侵略對象。法國的問題，就等於英國問題；萬一法蘭西帝國末日降臨時，那時，同樣降下來的，也是不列顚帝國的末日！可是，英國張伯倫一流人的最後對策呢，却是：萬一不得巳時，就根本放棄英倫三島，把國都放到加拿大去，這些話，聽起來，是駭人聽聞的；可是，這却絕不是什麼德國戈培爾的傑作；牠的作者，一點也不必打折扣，却就在央倫三島！並且，這也絕不是少數一兩個人的偶然吐露，牠的理論的根據，以及詳細的辦法，寫起那大概來，恐怕也要好幾千字。因為涉及太遠了，這裏且不贅。</p>
<p>我在這裏的主要意思，是在要說明：寓一波蘭完結，接下來，就是英·法·兩國的自身·而循着這條路綫下去，很明顯，一定會達到英帝國的崩潰。所以，英國的遠見人士，立刻就為他們主張取得了全國的擁護，英國不得不挺身一戰。——縱使意·西·參戰也在所不計。</p>
<p>現在戰，固然巳經嫌太遲，但是，如果再不戰呢，那末，以後就嬰更　！所以要戰的話，英國决定現在就戰。——這祇是問題的一面。</p>
<p>可是，還有更為重要的另一面。幾年前的阿比西尼亞問題，英國是可以戰的，然而牠後來不；西班牙問題，牠也有寗願一戰，而不能坐視的必要的，而然牠坐視了：奧國問題，捷克問題，以及今年的阿爾巴尼亞的吞併，每一件，都是牠帝國利益的重大威脅，而在蘇聯與法國堅强支持下，每一次，也都是牠作戰最好的時機，然而，牠不獨不戰，相反的，却帮助了德·意·屢次拆散法·蘇·的合作和共同行動。現在呢，德·蘇：突然緩衝的情形下，軍事意義上說，英·法·所處地位，道些年來，是最不利的一次，然而，牠却决定開始了戰爭！這，又為了什麽？</p>
<p>這樣叙述下來，到這裏，我們似乎碰到了間題的焦點；英帝國這一次抱了怎樣的見解和期望而踏入這次戰爭的呢？</p>
<p>令我們非常注目的，首先，是英國遠見人士們，（我的意思，是指着以邱吉·艾登·哈立法克斯·等人為代表的一集團。）對於「蘇德互不侵犯協定」的看法。上面的文章裏，我曾說過，如果英國相信蘇。德眞會同盟的話，那末，這次的仗，是沒有法子打的。現在想想，我一點也沒有說得過火；相反的，我再加上一句：如果一旦英國發現蘇·德·「眞」有「同盟」的傾向時，我想，那時候，是大概到了戰爭結東的前夜了。這，不過是一種為了說明方便的假設，自然在根本上，也許是絕對不可能的。所以，目前由英·法·兩國宣傳輿論機關所傳散的蘇·德·「同盟」說，英國的今天，很少人加以置信；那樣的說法，是說了讓別的國家人們看的，作用是：原先對蘇抱有希望的國家要失望；原先對德抱有希望的國家，也要失望。於是，在對蘇·德·普遍失望的國際空氣中，另有文章可做的，毫無疑問，應當是英法的外交。</p>
<p>對於蘇·德·問未來關係的估計，形式上，與這一次的英國態度，好像張伯倫首相在議院裏所說似的：「並無什麽影響」。可是實際上，我們必須知道，這却是在英國決定牠的態度時，最根本的因素之一。</p>
<p>希特拉一手挾着了「蘇德互不侵犯協定」，一手就指揮大軍，開始進攻波蘭。時，他向英國表示：這一次他的對象，祇是波蘭，與英國絕無關係；但另一面，却由齊亞諾向柏克勸說，以為英·法·這時，是不會為波而戰的，所以上計，祇有一個與德妥協。假如這時英國再下決心作戰的話，那末，一轉瞬間，波蘭就會成了德國的同盟國。</p>
<p>波蘭態度動搖了。但英國外交却開始活躍，支持波蘭，共同作戰。</p>
<p>情勢非常明顯，這樣一個危險，是存在着的；萬一波蘭終被德國擊潰呢？那末，那樣子，目前英國的決定，豈非是自我煩惱？</p>
<p>答案是絕對的否定。理由呢，大概可以歸納起來，為：（一）如果萬一波蘭被擊潰，被吞併，那末，一個被吞併了的波蘭，是說明着替德國增加了一個內部的矛盾和負担。可是，萬一德·波·妥協吿成，成了同盟的話，那却是在說明着，在國際要求重分世界資源的戰塲上，英國又多了一個新興的對手。到底那一途為害較輕呢？是一望而知的。（二）波蘭有一百多萬軍隊，而且是相當地現代化了的。德國想徹底加以擊潰，不用說，是得凖備相當的消耗。（三）如果戰爭延長下去，意大利與德國間的，為這事的磨擦，是會增加了起來的。（四）德國這種風雨雷霆的侵略氣燄下，一切東南歐的小國，都會恐慌起來的，一到波蘭危急，牠們當然可以自動起來援助波蘭。（五）而最主要的一點，一朝失去了像現在波蘭那樣一個有力障隔後的蘇聯與德國之問，無論如何，以後是到了多事之秋了，無論如何，這兩個英國最大的敵手，都不得不由敵視英國的目光裏，分出一部份來，彼此去互相注視了。</p>
<p>這些英國方面的預期，能否一一實現，目前還不得而知。不過，當波蘭應戰時，英國在目前的希冀，巳經達到了一半；當英·法·同時對德宜戰，一舉而永閉了德·波·妥協的門時，英國目前這一階段的願望，已經完滿地實現。</p>
<p>波蘭已經戰了起來，而且也當始終這麼戰了下去。——為了自己，也為了英·法·</p>
<p>目前大家注意點的集中地方，大概是：英國到底怎麽實踐援助波蘭？前些時候，（現在也還在傳說着）據說，英·法·準備於戰爭一爆發時，立刻派遣大批遠征軍，由海上輸往波蘭，一路由北歐各小國登岸，一路由羅馬尼亞登岸。現在呢，這一個傳說，照種種象跡看了起來，大概是落了空。何况，北歐各國與羅馬尼亞嚴守中立的悄形下，這一計劃，縱有，也無從實現。目前英國的對波援助，照這裏半公開的傳稱的計劃，大概是集中在兩方面：一面是空軍的應援，一面是借軟。據波蘭自己說，牠是可以向蘇聯買取大批軍火的。關於借款部份，自從戰爭爆發以來，英·法·巳經對波成立了八百五十萬鎊。總之，將來事後對於英·法·的是否誠意援助波蘭，應當以在道一個階段內，這兩方面做到什麼程度為準，而加以判斷。</p>
<p>軍事形勢上說，蘇聯不加入，其餘東南歐各國，及北歐各國不參戰的情勢下，波蘭對德國的應戰，政治作用，要遠過於軍事。這是一個犧牲性和政治性的戰爭。想獨自對德獲勝，大槪是絕對不可能。這個階段內，如果上面列舉的後面三種國際形勢，終於如英國願望而產生，那末，應該說是最理想的結果，否則的話，我們不妨老實說一句：英國對德戰爭的進行方向，就不得不有點飄搖了。但是飄搖並不是退後，正相反，因為方向飄搖了，那些執掌英帝國前進舵的舵工，就更不得不於動盪中，這時預先去尋覓出路。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　加碼與了結平衡　金市所跌極微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、變化殊少、起伏不大惟一般實力比較充裕之經營者、依然隨機加碼故雖有散戶不斷湧出、亦無重大影響、且前途極難捉摸、以目前環境而論、恐本週內未必能向榮、晨開即現萎靡、原受外匯仍鬆及現金號在售之影響、竟退達三千六百四十五元低價開盤、幸不久錢兌業等塌便宜貨競買、怠勢稍挽、徘徊於三千六百五六十元之間、延至十時半許、外匯忽報回緊、人心略振、金號代投機商不時加碼、立昂達三千六百六十八元、惟收盤前因匯市由軟轉平、賣風復來、仍回低至三千穴百五十元、午後因外匯週三無市、塲內平靜、祇證券帮購入若干、價格峪高、收盤已吿三千六百六十元、較上日僅小一元、全天交易稍淸、的千兩左右、銀樓飾金鎮日無變、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤祇跌二元</p>
<p>自展每條（十兩）初開因匯市略形硬化、加以現金號售意殷切、開市竟撳小十七元、現金號售予銀樓帮十兩、為三千六百四十五元、開後某錢兌業即來塌便宜買進、售者見機扳價、頓見回起十五元、錢兌業進證券帮卅兩為三千六百六十元、後因金號代客吐出百餘兩、復撳低十元、金號賣予證券帮四十兩、為三千六百五十元、時外滙忽報回軟、人心一振、某金號代投機商收購、且香港帮亦稍來活動、故又見回升十八元、銀樓帮進金號二十兩、為三千六百六十八元、旋以散戶賣風又起、且匯市已由緊回平、進者頓形寥寥、遂再下降十八元、錢兌業互做十兩、為三千六百五十元、午刻重行回高、錢兌業進金號二十兩、為三千六百五十四元作午收價、午後情况愈靜、開市做高一元、證券帮進金號一十兩、為三千六百五十五元、後證券帮續吸數十兩、又抬起五元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、為三千六百六十元、入後回落二元、錢兌業互做十兩、為三千六百五十八元、後銀樓帮進金號二十兩、為三千六百六十元作晚收價、結果軋小二元、查已連跌四天、共計七十元、全大二十三元上落、現金號之牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進約减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元之譜、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤鮮少變動、故終日未見更改、大同行仍懸三百七十元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進仍均减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>交易不旺　滙市絕平</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、均無上落、英美匯暗市、靜中微現鬆勢、惟結果與隔昨收盤不分榮辱、晨初以英美匯兌略縮、致開盤重吿英平美緊故態、嗣因日行正金曁美行前來吐塞、及投機商繼續拋賣、雖滙豐見賤願吸、然頭寸已感充足、英金曾長至五辦士二五、美匯亦硬達八元六二五、旋乃進口商需要結匯、並投機商亦獲利補空、故市勢一度吿軟、為五辦士二〇三一二五及八元半、延至午刻、買賣雙方、猶豫小前、成交頓轉淸淡、遂於平定狀態下、即吿收盤英金五辦士二一八七五、美匯八元五六二五、與上日相埒、期貨趨勢、亦與現貨無異、半天成交平平、</p>
<p>日商賣出洋行進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮一八七五、遠期跌二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬大〇六二五、美對英小一二五、對滬長二角、對法升一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士二一八七五、美匯八元五三一二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃匯兌轉縮之故、開後日行首來塞出、兼美行及投機商亦有賣胃、惟匯豐見賤吸進、故鬆勢緩和、計正金吐予匯豐現貨英金五辦士二五、繼之投機商賣予大通等外行現貨美滙八元六二五、同時某行亦售予同行現貨美滙八元五六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小一分二五、此後洋行界稍來扒進、並投機商等補空、致情勢一度轉軟、計洋行結進外行現貨美應八元五六二五及半元、繼而投機商補進有利十二月份美匯八元三七五、時英金亦隨軟至五辦士二〇三一二五、嗣因賣買觀望、成交頓稀、是以為狀亦見平定、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士二一八七五、美匯八元五六二五、十二月份英金五辦士一二五、美滙八元三七五、結果比上日現期英美兩匯、俱無榮辱、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港滙市無變化</p>
<p>香港十五日電、今晨匯市開盤平平、英美日滙均不動、申匯現貨微升一元、為二百八十四元、十一時三十分、平平無榮辱、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津美滙略鬆動</p>
<p>天津十五日電、今晨匯市開盤呆滯、英匯不動、仍為五辦士〇六二五、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為八元二角半、申匯升七角五分、為一百〇三元二角半、「聯鈔」暗盤亦昂七角半、為九十二元五角、</p>
<h3>外幣盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊供求兩稀、市况呆滯未更、英金票因鎊價虛弱而稍降、美金票需要較殷、市價盤旋帶堅、初為十一元六角二分、晚市為十一元六用五分、過程變動頗狹、香港票新加坡票疲弱、市價微降、法郞荷蘭票需要見增、市况稍堅、日金票需要未盛、晚市為一元二角九分、朝鮮票供求呆滯、晚市為一元一角五分五厘、昨日市價、英金票降二角、美金票升三分、香港票降一分、法郞票升五厘、新加坡票降一角、荷蘭票升一角、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>從烚赤換算爲標金</h3>
<p>答應永玉先生：</p>
<p>自八一三戰後，本市標金市塲現貨交易，完全停止，故市上現標金，多數已為收購鎔化為烚赤，蓋現時金條之買賣，惟烚赤而巳。故將標金售與現金號或銀樓業等，必須除去火工若干，但為數不大，且無正式之規定。惟標金之成色較遜於烚赤，標金原祇九·七八，烚赤則有九·九三，相差為〇·一五。若欲求標金一平（重七十兩）之價，祇須將標金一平（七十兩）乘烚赤之市價，再乘標金與烚赤成色之差，以烚赤一平之市價相减即得，其公式如左：</p>
<h3>貼現不變</h3>
<p>昨匯劑票據貼現率、每千元上午由三十七元、步退至三十六元、下午站於三十六七元間、終為三十七元、與上日價同、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍開一角五分云、</p>
<h3>美銀仍平　英印疲落</h3>
<p>十四日倫敦電、銀市大衆賣出、缺乏維持、少交易、市面平、收盤後尙平、印度照掛牌價稍有吃胃、大條銀、近期縮一八七五、遠期跌二五、紐約銀電、美現貨呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平疲、現貨與十二月均跌十七安那、一月份小十五安那、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債閒散　外股復昂</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况经隔日一度之上漲後、即無續漲能力、所傳借款之說、仍屬無稽讕言、稍有興奮之人氣、適為老多頭出籠所利用、欲抑必揚、此固多頭投機之手段、惟惜盲從者不加思索、隨波逐流、南京謠言、愈喧愈盛、昨日午前市價初堅後疲、終仍稍稍安定、多方仍在掙扎、多方之狡黠者已在緩緩塞出、午後初做再行拉抬、以迷浮多耳目、但出籠漸漸加衆、市價乃緩緩下垂、而一般散戶尙有乘低收進者、天生大豐久豐等始終賣出、結果乙種打破九元、戊種打破八元、略漲一日、完全曇花一現、比隔日小一角至五角、成交總數約計七十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交寗紹輪船公司股價爲八元、成交廿股、</p>
<p>衆業公所市况寗靜趨堅、鋼業股奇峯突出、開盤時祇十二元二角、嗣後逐步挺進至十三元二角買進、三角賣出收盤、成交額相當龐大、橡皮股仍稍鬆軟、</p>
<p>倫敦十四日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍吿平穩、上下檔各公債均無榮辱，</p>
<p>倫敦十四日電今日英商遠東各公司股票掛脾行市又轉下游、各股大致均見跌落、上海自來水A種股跌一鎊、為十鎊正、麥加利銀行股續跌五先令、為八鎊正、滙豐銀行英倫註册股跌一鎊、為八十四鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌二便士、為十八先令一便士、</p>
<h3>紗花　粗紗供求兩旺　行情無大上落</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、但起伏狹小、交易淸淡、故情况無勁、至於現紗銷路、細紗雖不廣泛、惟十支粗紗、華南諸帮納胃依然寬宏、且搜羅不絕於途、然廠方為减少存貨及推銷起見、均願開售、由此一來、市價不能上升、但比二十支紗價為昂、目前就一般經營者之議論、謂原棉鬆落無望、廠方成本提高、紗市基礎、或可鞏固一步矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市態無大變遷、開價為六百四十七元、旋以外匯掛出勿動、人氣尤平、少頃聞廣帮粗紗吃胃仍强、同業復來收進、又見回升至六百四十八元、但市塲情形仍屬散漫無勁也、查半日成交一千三百五十五包、行情大致與上日不相上下、廠方由崇信廠開出二十支大發二百五十包、價為六百十二元現墊、十支大發一百包、價為五百二十元、今日出口紗有一百四十四件運香港、十五件運廣州灣、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行七八五　福州一二五</p>
<p>雲南二五　香港三五〇</p>
<p>內地七〇　統計一、三五五</p>
<h3>業中囤藏　棉花待賈而沽</h3>
<p>本棉交易略見清淡、良以紗市乏勁、廠胃又復不健、日廠始終求見動辦、惟永安廠近來在粗紗方面、開出不少、補進平果爾原料、以抵銷襯、略為點綴而已、但同業心思濃密、將身骨乾燥、顏色鮮潔之貨、業已打包囤藏上棧、以待善價而售，足見看高意思甚挺也、蘇北來源、計通花三千七百二五包、常陰沙四百八十八包、北沙來六百七十四件、又今日出口花有三百五十七件運香港、五十件運海口、茲將現棉情形錄後、</p>
<p>海提尖　一二七·〇〇　同業進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>常陰沙一二九·五〇　同業進四〇〇包</p>
<p>通花一三五·〇〇　一三五四〇　同業進三六二包</p>
<p>美細絨一二九·五〇　同業進二〇〇包</p>
<p>通花一三五·二五　同業進三〇〇包</p>
<p>平果爾二八·〇〇　永安進二〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來又吿沉悶、紗銷未見起色、故使廠方靜寂、同業亦暫抱觀望態度、然日方廠商、尙有零星美棉交易、惟為數甚微、俱為即裝者、然大衆意見、美棉交易、或有向榮之日也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來殊形活躍、昨日晨初即呈堅定形態、布疋銷數、日見起色、嚴近父有大批開出、因之廠方需要甚健、引起大量之現貨交易、同業因而在市搜購頗烈、故竟有迷日之漲風、並引起大部空頭之抵補、昨日收盤、較之上日又漲三四磅音、然昨日印度連同預測、反見跌落四羅比餘、埃及停市業已二日、利物浦跌七便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　客秈囤貨　昨有回出</h3>
<p>米市自此週內一路飛升、各價似達頂盤、前午市一度轉懈後、昨則開手仍屬平常、乃囤戶因見實銷已覺冷淡、私計似乏盈利希望、不約而同大都停手、兼之本鄉店胃、愈為懈淡、致形勢頓反前之轟動而呈軟弱、惟客販方面、以身本關係、猶抱守持之策、售意不鬆、在雙方相持之下、所以中市現象形成定色、然際此市面、恒見劇烈變化、無論買賣雙方、一遇市面不振、即其戒心、囤戶見此景象、突有回出、霎時跟踪直追者頗不乏人、羣相拋售、市貨充斥、本鄉作客均袖手觀望、銷塲愈呆、市面遂難支持、頓見下遊結果、若新粳以到貨獨旺、有蘇崑靑泗楓練等貨二十三四車、行情較前市立降半元光景、餘外各貨亦貶短二三角不一、若江北尖初開為二十八元、收盤為二十七元八角、次至二十七元三四角、京蕪尖初開二十八元一二角、後祇一十八元二十七元八角半、次至砶米二十六元半、總計統市成交數僅六千餘包而已、</p>
<p>客秈晨間續有店囤鄕作問津、貨方再度扳提、市價一度喊起一二角、惟店舖納胃甚懈、稍辦即止、而內地鄉莊亦嫌昂觀望、囤戶操縱漸乏憑藉、旋聞某行等昨日新到皖秈二萬多包、巳在卸棧中、獲利浮戶立有售出、市乃逐次平落、統市交易亦不足二千包、然蕪湖秈高價已開至二十八元二角云、</p>
<h3>粉無整批去路</h3>
<p>現粉市况、頗見平庸、因銷場方面、寂無生氣、南北兩帮、祇有零星點綴，迄無大額去路、即本街零批交易、亦受內地雜脾粉廉價傾銷影響、進胃呆懈、統市僅有靑島帮散戶、及港帮因有船位、略有配置、成交不足三萬包、二號粉廠盤續開七元一角、回籠棧單粉售價別小五六分至一角不等、情勢大致與前相仿、</p>
<p>麥市續呈僵局、各廠進胃、一致呆頓、囤戶更觀望不取、結果僅市塲方面、做開蘇州麥三車、價為十一元一角半、較前已跌二三角云、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油再漲</h3>
<p>神戶桶油七十五元　生汕運港頗為不絕</p>
<p>荳油市况、處於來源不湧之潛勢下、造成投機家之壟斷、以致行市一再猛抬、神戶桶油已達七十五元之罕有高價、簍裝油雖比較鬆動、但大局依然邁步前進、行情頻升、昨桶油漲一元五角、簍油升一元二三角、成交神戶油十桶、價詳市價欄、大連油二十桶、膠州油三百件、靑岐油一百件、烟岐油一百件、江北桶油三十桶、靑島桶油五十桶、又二三禮拜交一百桶、花生油港帮小動、由本街去膠州一百件、靑島桶油一百五十桶、行情比前市漲一元至五角、</p>
<p>香港以港滬匯價合算、且為積儲起見、又値生油出新之際、故生油運港、頗為不絕、昨日又有生油一百六十件及四千一百四十聽運港、復有生仁一百二十三包、豆子九百六十七包、同於今日出口赴港、運往海口者有豆十八十七包、到滬豆子只二百二十包、由北沙來、</p>
<h3>疋頭　寬緊駝絨　及時旺銷</h3>
<p>昨呢羢交易零多整少、貨價則依然堅挺、但由掮客轉手之佣金、賣方暗中似肯增加之象、寬緊駱駝羢現正應時當令、因之銷勢甚形暢旺、呢絨業無一不健進者、頭號毛背駱駝絨每碼批售五元七角半、天翔無敵牌條紫美術絨每碼批售五元五角、緯綸老虎圖五元二角半、維一雙鹿圖二元七角半、美術三元六角、天和五福牌二元〇五分、其他雜牌次號貨普通售一元八九角、洋貨帮綢緞莊門市舖子進胃較呢絨帮為盛、</p>
<p>今日出口疋頭有一百八十四件運杳港、九十七件運廣州灣、二十八件運海防、二百四十四件運海防、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條　略見遜色</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條、日前在跳甚厲、本街建築帮及津烟靑諸帮相率採辦甚殷、唯自最近以來、人心轉變、標凖反見軟化、較前略遜四五十元光景、刻市如三分至四分、每噸沽七百五十元、五分至一寸、每噸售七百十元左右、日前建築帮辦去二十餘噸、靑島帮宣購三十噸、（但未運去）、天津及烟台亦裝去十餘噸之譜、又運往寗波二十噸左右、運往福建亦有十餘噸云、</p>
<h3>統計　物價之變動</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>—九月份—（一）</p>

<p>已經釋出</p>
<p>其條件為該輪須經「大道」政府一航局」施行檢騐、該日方卵翼下之政權施行特殊檢騐、所索費用、當頗不小、但輪船本身、不致向偽方登記、而將繼續在葡旗下行駛云、又據另一葡商公司某昌聲稱、渠已接該公司各輪釋出之通知、但刻正待日方提出條件、庶該公司各輪復能通航云、聞諸可靠方面、五小</p>
<p>公司合併</p>
<p>而成一葡商大輪船公司之企圖、刻正進行中、惟因有關係輪主頗衆、故組織公司事宜、進行遲滯、謠傳葡當局在滬或將不復准任何船隻註册一說、葡總領事昨加否認、據稱此說、實屬子虛、又訊、葡商輪公司五家、正會商合辦、組織大公司一家、刻正在進行中一說、據大光社記者分向葡商美利輪船公司正德輪船公司及代理葡輪之華美航業公司等探詢、均</p>

<p>馬相老行述</p>
<p>毛西壁所撰讀之相老行述云、老師姓馬氏、字相伯、江蘇丹陽人也、父松岩公、業醫、性好施、母沈太夫人、亦樂善為懷、老師以淸道光廿年（民國紀元前七十二年）三月十九日生、即鴉片戰爭英人陷我舟山之歲也、五歲入學、是年其弟眉叔生、故老師長眉叔五歲、綜合老帥生平行誼、可分為四時期、謹述如下、</p>
<p>（一）少年修養時期　人學後、即讀敎中經典及四子書、聰頴絕倫、過目成誦、年十一、與弟眉叔入徐滙公學、四書五經畢讀後、先後計讀普通科者十年、專門科者又十年、宗敎·哲學·希臘·拉丁·理化·天算等科、無不淹通、</p>
<p>（二）布敎從政時期　老師年十四歲、洪秀全入金陵、二十以後、奉敎會命、在蘇太間從事救濟事業、力疾從公、不辭勞苦、年三十、羅馬敎廷授以司鐸之職、於是傳敎於蘇皖之間、並得松岩公同意、散財紓難、輓近發起開濬徐滙市河曁鬻書、以充水災賑款、此皆老師秉承家敎、並推基督愛上帝愛鄰人之心、以及於難胞也、在從政方面、以辦理外交與議政為主、辦理外交則在二十六至五十六歲廿年之間、初入李文忠幕、帮辦洋務、深　器重、擬辦國　銀行、率派至美借款五千萬、卒以廷臣梗議、未果、為鞏固邦交、派赴朝鮮、而大院君不能用、赴法考察商務、備受歡迎、五旬以後、曾任長崎領事曁使館參贊、至任江蘇外交司則在民國元年議政時期、前後亦有十年之久、紀元前二年、江蘇省諮議局成立、老師被選為省議員、民二改為省議會、民三袁氏命令解散、民六復活、嗣後每屆改選、老師必獲選、對江蘇省政、獻替良多、</p>
<p>（三）辦學時期　老師辦震旦、年已六十四、斥資數萬目的從語言入首、以求西學科目有四大類、（甲）語文學、（乙）象數學、（丙）格物學、（丁）致知學、老師自任拉丁·致知·天算、星期日集會演講、其他科目、則敎會長老任之、學校行政、則學生生佐之、乃開學生自治之先河、老師於震旦散學後、成立復旦、年已六十六矣、請准江督周馥、撥吳淞砲台灣官地七十餘畝為校址、並撥款二萬元、就吳淞提督行轅、先行開辦、又請准江督、月撥　千元為常年經費、復旦公學之基礎乃立、老師為第一任校長、翌年、奉派赴日、辦理歸國學生善後事宜、兩年之間、三易校長、嚴又陵·夏劍丞·高夢旦·三公也、紀元前三年復職、紀元前二年以諮議局議員兼領絞務、辛亥光復、吳淞校舍被佔、停頓一年、民元、老師命于右任·邵力子·請當局撥徐家滙李公祠為校舍、並奉孫總統撥款萬元、繼續辦理、老帥再復任為校長、其間去而復職者凡二、老師關懷母校之深、於此可見、</p>
<p>（四）晚年著述及蒙靴時期　七十八歲以後、老師則居土山灣樂善堂、臨池作書，復習繪事、時人得之者、奉為珍品、老師除五十以後、與其弟眉叔成馬氏文通一書、為中國文法圭臬、六十以後、著有拉丁文通、為震旦敎本外、八十以後、則有致知淺說之作、九十以後、則有致知淺說續編、復有四聖福音之譯著、九一八事變後、老師多憂時憤世之言、二十五年冬入京、翌年中央選任為國府委員、秋、滬戰作、國府西邊、老師安車入桂、去秋、老師年九十有九、移居諒山、本年十一月四日、無疾而終、適百歲壽誕後七月有半也、綜觀老師生平、政治方面、均未能行其志、贊助文忠辦理外交、而國家銀行計劃未能實行、謀圖中鮮邦交、而大院君不能用、民五袁氏帝制自為、老師勸阻勿聽，此其明徵也、至辦學則雖遭挫折、而再接再厲、終底於成、母校歷史之久、成績之宏、皆老師之賜也、近十餘年來、老師年事雖高、又不良於行、而對於手創之母校、時刻不忘、十九年秋、復旦舉行一十五週紀念、則遠赴江灣、二十三年夏、附中舉行九五祝嘏、二十四年春、附中力學堂落成、則均軒車蒞止、參加典禮、老師為人富情感、好與靑年人晤談、向求書法、有求必應、揮毫雖累數小時怡如也、其人生觀可謂與孔聖「發憤忘食、樂以忘憂、不知老之將至、相似、最近病中聞捷音、則異常興奮、起坐進食、彌留尙有「消息消息」之微弱聲可聞、則其關懷國事與孫中山先生「和平奮鬥救中國」之臨終遺言、具有同等意義也、老師所期之好消息、雖尙有待、而老師對辦敎育之成功、靈而有知、對此今日致祭滿堂桃李、必含笑於白雲鄕矣、</p>
<h3>挪威三巨輪　定期離滬</h3>
<p>泰山三民兩輪南駛　鐵達尼輪開往美國</p>
<p>本埠英商天祥洋行經理挪威國籍巨大特快新輪多艘、噸位均在一萬二千噸以上、專航上海到美國紐的洛杉機、及上海到香港新加坡樓榔等埠、航行非常迅速、由上海到紐約祗要三十四天可達、上海到香港二天可達、本月十七日開往香港新加坡為「泰山號」（M/Y　“Taishan”）、開往美國為「鐵達尼」號（M/Y“Titania”）又邇近歐戰起釁以還、此間船隻驟見减少、故出口各輪貨儎均甚踴躍、本埠聯順行代理免那洋行之挪威商三民輪船、常川行駛滬港防航綫、因船期準確迅速、客位設備完全、裝貨手續簡捷、港防各埠均設有倉庫、故貨主搭客咸感滿意、歷次滿載客貨而去、現經探悉該輪將於（十六日）抵滬、停泊金利源浮筒、定於二十日第五次直放香港海防、並悉客貨艙位大部巳經預定、尤以紗布為大宗云、該輪噸位三五〇〇噸、速率十一海哩、客位計七百餘名、</p>
<h3>地產交易活躍　上月成交千餘萬元　同福里房地產出售尚未成交　業主索價一百四十萬元以上</h3>
<p>本市地產交易、近更活躍、日前報載中區近有大地產成交新聞一則、有云、上月地產成交、約達三百五十萬元、其實上月成交數量、不止此數、當在千萬元以上、又云、中區靜安寺路某里、亦已易主成交、價為一百二十二萬元、閱其所載畝分、顯係指同福里而言、茲向該同福里業主方面經手人沈兆九律師探悉、該里房地產、現尚未有出售成交之事、蓋以該產地位中區、實為極優良之地產、業主方面、非得有一百四十萬元以上之代價、不願輕易出售云、按本市地產、從前局方所估價値、實已不適合現時需要之標準、聞本年將有提高改估之趨勢、果爾、則本市房地產、勢必益為高貴矣、</p>

<h3>日本發生米荒　朝鮮台灣兩地恐難接濟　滬荳米業定期籌商儲囤　滬米價以後不致受影響</h3>
<p>日本今年水旱成災、米糧歉收、向國外採購食米、開近六年來未有之現象、緣日本西部二十三縣如山口·廣島·岡山·等縣、荒歉為數年來所未有、日政府規定米價、最高不得超過三十五元四角、至九月交易所市價已達四十二元左右、人民向米店購買、殆達五十元左右、日政府乃設法由台灣輸入第一期、以資調劑、並再規定最高米價為三十八元一角三分、</p>
<p>朝鮮台灣　亦告減收</p>
<p>但日政府雖規定限價、米價仍扶搖直上、矧朝鮮台灣等區亦較往歲减收、據日政府公佈、今年朝鮮實收為一千三百九十九萬石、比去年减收一千零十三萬石、台灣第一期米實收四百零三萬石、較去年减收八十六萬石、近十餘年來、日本每年須由朝鮮輸入八百萬石乃至一千萬石之米、由台灣亦輸入四五百萬石、</p>
<p>委托三井　從事採辦</p>
<p>然以目前淸形觀之、朝鮮台灣繼續輸入、恐感困難、惟為未兩綢繆計、聞又委託日商三井洋行、從事向蕪湖九江常熟常州採購、運往華北儲囤、此舉內地不受影響、惟上海方面、如果日方確有其事、一部分食米容受影響、</p>
<p>米業團體　大量採購</p>
<p>據悉產區米價每石售價十四五元、加以搬運耗費及捐稅每石成本亦不過二十元左右、故米市塲售價之上漲、顯係有意抬高也、然米價漲跌攸關市民生計頗鉅、昨據米業界某領袖吿悉、現米業團體甫在設法大量採購、設立公倉儲囤、藉以穩定人心、抑低米價、上海豆米行業同業公會已定於今日（十六日）下午三時、召開執監聯席會議、届時將提出討論儲囤事宜、惟米業界深盼當局領導、俾除未來民食之恐慌</p>
<p>京滬米糧　大量抵滬</p>
<p>日方近因各地華軍游擊隊活躍、故於八日起、將兩路貨車减少一半（計二十輛）、分向各地運兵增援、以致貨運呆滯、而尤以米糧所受影響為最巨、致數日間、米價飛漲、達二三元之多、及至昨日、兩路貨車巳恢復原狀、且因各站積貨過多、臨時又增加十輛、故內地米糧、獲大批到埠、共計達六千石、多數均為同里崑山之白粳、惟秈米則吿缺如、人心隨之鎭定、需要因之减少、成交不多、除秈米略跌數角外、其餘各貨均跌一元以上、</p>
<h3>被拘之持械華人　英軍尙未釋放　究屬於何部隊至今未明　一度絕食嗣又繼續進餐</h3>
<p>大陸報云、上星期五日晨、有衣制服持步槍手槍與手溜彈者十六人、在白利南路被東旭萊隊英兵解除武裝、而加拘留、十六人對於被覊甚為不滿、乃於週杪實行飢餓罷工、事起於星期日晨、彼等吿守囚室之英兵謂若不釋出、即不進食、英兵不加反封、彼等乃實行其絕食決心、至午餐時、十六人仍拒不進食、惟內有數人頗形憔悴、迨星期一日晨餐時、彼等不能復忍、二十四小時之飢餓罷工、乃吿終止、迄至昨（十四日）夜、猶無人前往認領、故彼等仍在東旭萊隊覊禁中、聞英軍與被禁諸人、均已漸感厭煩、但雙方對開釋一節、俱未能有所行動、英軍當局決計復待數日、以俟十六人之主子前往接洽、然後籌備處理此案、但對於將吾有人認領、不無疑惑、據該十六人聲稱、彼等的於十天前自皖省抵滬、然彼等顯亦不知爲何人工作、僅於抵滬後有人給予制服、槍械與手溜彈、並令擇道巡邏、彼等乃擇白利南路而行、旋遭東旭萊隊拘捕、彼等所衣綠色制服、與「大道」警察或所謂「自衛團」等之制服、均不相同、</p>
<h3>滬甬貨運日繁</h3>
<p>鎮海口外帆檣雲集　商輪海船共十五艘</p>

<h3>不能跟著閉幕</h3>
<p>— 聞歌</p>
<p>語文展覽會已經閉幕了。然而實際的語文運動，還正在發軔的時期，那是不能跟著展覽會而「閉幕的。所以為了不辜負這决展覽的意義，並且為了配合建設大衆文學才產生的通俗文學的進展起見，我們正應該擔負起積極展開這一運動的責任。</p>
<p>誰都不能否認的吧，語文並不是點綴用的骨董，而是現實的東西；旣是現實的，就要以大衆為取捨的標凖。跟大衆相適合的，我們要爭取，發展；不大為大衆所適合的，我們要抉擇，揚棄；若是完全不對的，那只有請它迥避；除此以外，是沒有所謂折衷方案的。</p>
<p>過去，從梁啟超的解放古文起，以至於提倡白話文主張注音符號止，對於語文運動上的貢獻，我們當然不能去忽視它，然而也不能說一點沒有意見。最明顯的，就是和舊東西妥協的精神太厲害，以致弄來弄去，總還是為「小衆」着想的地方多，為「大衆」着想的地方少。</p>
<p>雖然，舊的東西有不少的優點存在着，不過，也只是一些而已；而且那也必須根據大衆眞正需要而决定·</p>
<p>然則什麼是大衆所需要的呢？那自然是「語文一致」。所語文一致。這實在是最低限度的要求，再也不能任意「特價」的。試看五四以後直到今天用方塊字寫的白話文，有幾篇可算是眞正語文一致的文章？沒有，沒有！為什麼呢？一句話；是沒有替大衆着想的緣故。所謂眞正能算作語文一致而能為大衆接受的，應該是簡單，合理，容易，普遍且能適合現代科學所需要的，關於這，到現在，似乎只有拉丁化新文字建設的大衆語能應付，因為新文字是活的文字，所以跟活的大衆，是再適合也沒有了。</p>
<p>我們旣然有了這種新文字作為語文運動努力的目標，那末可以毫不遲疑的幹了。不過，有些迷戀者便痛心起來，以為這麼做太辜負了漢字的歷史，並且還抹煞它的藝術價値。其實，這未免太不理解社會進化的原則。雖說漢字歷史很悠久，但並不是一成不變的，如古籀的變成篆隸，篆隸的變成行楷，不都是變嗎？這尸是老生的常談了。如今的推行新文字，也是文字進化上所必有的現象，又何必另眼相看呢？何况，這新文字的推行，又純粹為的大衆。</p>
<p>幹吧，來推行為大衆着想的新文字！如果過幾時還有語文展覽的舉辦的話，我希望有十百倍於今天的成績呈現給大家看。</p>
<p>眞的，語文運動是不能跟著展覽會而閉幕的，因為世界是繼續地進展著——沒有說錯吧！我的廢話。</p>
<h3>兩個姑娘　—刧灰拾記—</h3>
<p>— 唐韋</p>
<p>剛剛到了九月的末梢，在哈爾濱街上，衣服單薄已經有點挨不住冷風的侵襲了。</p>
<p>我拉起西服的領子，手挿在褲子兜袋裏，胳膊使勁挾着肋條，這副走像也許不大神氣，所以連路旁的乞丐也都不睬我一眼。</p>
<p>從我住的地方跑到西八雜市，足足費去兩個鐘點，等我找到預定的房號，太陽已經不在宇內留一絲光明的痕跡了。</p>
<p>這是非常靠近郊外的一間房子，除了迎面的馬路和左邊幾間相同的小房間外，北邊和西面，是一片漫無邊際的大草原。</p>
<p>我輕輕的在門上敲了幾下，一個白髮斑斑的俄國老婦人，從裏邊探出頭來，她只向我一望便抽身回去了。接着一陣皮鞋的響聲，潘首先跑出來，她搶過我的一只手去。</p>
<p>「你已經復元了嗎？還咳嗽吧？」她問。</p>
<p>「咳嗽還有點！」</p>
<p>我們進來，迎面站着一個白晳晳的，有着一雙圓圓的大眼睛的女人；她的皮色和潘比起來，簡道使人疑惑她們不是同一個民族。</p>
<p>「我的同學徐！這里是她住的地方。」潘為我介紹。</p>
<p>徐過去在一個朋友的宴會上見過，所以今天見面她多少有點驚訝了。</p>
<p>「眞想不到潘所說的梁先生原來就是唐先生。</p>
<p>她巧倩的笑着。</p>
<p>「我們在一個朋友請客的時候見過一次！」我向潘解釋</p>
<p>房間並不十分寬敞，再加上墻壁角那只大衣櫉，就更沒有一點空閒的地方了；一張木牀，和一只不甚大的寫字檯，擺在窗戶下邊，牀單白得耀眼，灰色的墻皮上斜掛着兩張照片，看起來非常雅潔，而緊凑。</p>
<p>潘說着別來兩個月的經過，和山巖中弟兄們生活情形。在她的談話中我聽到許多興奮的故事；同時我也聽到了兩個朋友的犧牲，和一個朋友在負傷。</p>
<p>「隊伍中最大的困難，就是缺乏醫藥。」她剛愎的說。</p>
<p>「藥品已經預備了一部份；現在負傷的人多不多？」</p>
<p>「一共有九個人，如果藥品再不到，起碼有五個人危險！」　「你這次來，除了醫藥之外，還有另外的使命沒有？」</p>
<p>「主要的是藥品；再就是帶來孫大隊長，和大隊部朋友們慰問你的信！」</p>
<p>「實在慚愧，大家在火壁彈雨間拚命，我舒舒服服的蹲在哈爾濱街上，怎麽當得起大家的慰問。」</p>
<p>她把三四封信一同交給我，我羞怯去挨着封拆讀；在我們談話的時候沒有留心徐是什麼時候出去的，我讀完信，牠買來麵包，腸子，還有一匣比較客氣的西洋點心。</p>
<p>「也許唐先生……她急改嘴說；「或者梁先生也沒有吃晚飯，請用點點心吧！」</p>
<p>她很禮貌的打開點心盒子</p>
<p>「這太考究啦！」</p>
<p>「好在一决。」</p>
<p>潘不大喜歡點心，她揑起一塊很厚的麵包皮，一邊吃一邊往下講；</p>
<p>「上月末，江水出岸，隊伍正住在長發屯，半夜聽見水聲，不到十分鐘的工夫，水巳經漫了脖了；兵和百姓上下好幾百口，拖泥帶水往躍馬嶺跑；他媽的，天亮跟李喜三的，正好走個碰頭，要不是于四砲（註）給解圍，這回非拚個你死我活不可！」</p>
<p>她連二並三的咬了幾口麵包，然後又塞着一片乾腸。</p>
<p>徐彷彿看不過眼去，從旁勸解她！</p>
<p>「你慢點吃，乾癟皮不好消化！</p>
<p>潘彷彿不大留心她的警吿；她仍然往下講；</p>
<p>「結果他們串給我們四百粒子彈，弟兄們向他們要了足有兩包烟捲……。」</p>
<p>「你今天和徐小姐同住？」</p>
<p>「是的和徐同住！」……</p>
<p>最後我們決定藥品携帶的方法，並的定明天早晨再來看她。</p>
<p>歸來，巳近深夜，風幾乎穿透了我的骨髓，兩個完全不同的女孩子，在我的腦海裏像一綑火似的跳顫着。</p>
<h3>燈下草</h3>
<p>— 藍雯</p>
<p>古城</p>
<p>報紙上又有了關於那古城的消息，一口氣讀完了，我有點兒靜不下心來。就折攏了報。</p>
<p>古城常牽起我一綫幻想，在往日。</p>
<p>晚霞燒紅了半個天，漫步於城堞上豈非「無限好」（可惜祇是近黃昏。）身傍如果有個伴步的人，說不凖你竟忘了晚飯的時辰。</p>
<p>瞧着古城也許會有一塲華麗的古代夢吧？</p>
<p>但過去也曾有人抱怨過呢，不就為了一座城把請願的隊伍隔開了嗎？</p>
<p>如今，說是要拆城了。你憤慨不？</p>
<p>懂得用沉默來代替言語，也該懂得出行動來發洩憤怒。</p>
<p>又打開了報，我在我尋古城怒吼的消息。</p>
<p>旅人</p>
<p>飄過海，旅人從遼遠的地方歸來，那兒是不自由的牢籠，魔手扼緊了人的喉嚨，誰都沒有呼吸的自在。</p>
<p>可是，這兒呢？船靠了岸　旅人愁悵了。「天下烏鴉」般黑」，「何處是凈土」？烽烟遠去，光明早跟蹤而往了。</p>
<p>是烽火的年代，是沒有嘻笑的歲月。旅人，你跋涉得倦了嗎？抑是為一些小小的不幸纏繞得苦呢？</p>
<p>別彈起厭倦之歌；得擂一番戰鼓。走進戰鬥的行列去。</p>
<h3>夜想</h3>
<p>— 蕭星</p>
<p>小山獨立，寂寞的流水，日子是憂悒的呢！</p>
<p>金色的夢，紫色的夢，翩翩飛舞，終於撞在現實的小釘子上，碎了，滅了。於是，整個世界也突然換了個模樣，苦悶襲來如小蛇，固執的在體內蠕動。</p>
<p>我羨慕闊肩膀的漢子，更敬佩自健壯心靈的人；而自己却脆弱得可憐。（我憶起薄薄的冰，一個指　也能戳穿一個洞。）</p>
<p>歲月無聲無息的逝掉，伴着人家屋頂上淡淡的炊烟。我一向把自己關閉在屋子裏。田野的氣息會使我淸新吧？風雨的磨煉將令我强健吧？是該走出去的時候了。（茫茫夜，我或將有遠行，迎着一個招呼。）</p>
<p>「你在想些什麽呢？這年頭，這日子。」日間一位來訪的友人問。我習於思索，效哲學家的冥想，且終日以苦思麼折那年青的生命。但，並沒有回答她的話，我祇淡淡地笑了一笑。</p>
<p>淺黃的燈光畫了一個圓圓的小圈，我的思想也關閉在這小天地內。「這年頭，這日子」短短的六個字狠狠地鞭撻着。我，有點昏昏然了，我說不出那重量。然而，對於明天」，我並不感到毫不能為力。我知道；「要活下去」。</p>
<p>旣逃失了路途，仍能勇敢的奔向前去；在任何失望之後，也不讓年靑的良心的呼聲消沉下來，總歸會找出一條大道來的。我有如此的確信。</p>
<h3>奮鬬</h3>
<p>— Ａ．Ｈ．Ｏlough著　品品譯</p>
<p>別這末說，奮鬭無效，</p>
<p>工作與創傷更是徒然，</p>
<p>敵人不會退不會敗，</p>
<p>一切都不變動。</p>
<p>假使希望是受欺者，恐懼便是欺人者了；</p>
<p>瞧，在天邊渺茫的雲霞中，</p>
<p>你的同志還在追逐飛鳥，</p>
<p>而你已株守不動了。</p>
<p>倦了的水波空自搖曳，</p>
<p>像沒有地方可流去，</p>
<p>但遠遠地，穿過溪流，打個出口，</p>
<p>海水泰然來了。</p>
<p>不單是東方的窗邊，</p>
<p>當黎明光芒燦爛地</p>
<p>慢慢爬上天空的時候，</p>
<p>就是西方，看呀，大地也閃亮了。</p>

<p>皮黃劇的已近沒落，是無可諱言的事實。時代最能決定社會的一切，戲劇的現代使命，是現實生活的反映，不專是過去原封不動的歷史的搬演。同時每一項藝術，都寓有作者的生命力，無論是演員或是劇作人。舊瓶新酒的意義，是利用舊有的形式，而附以全新的內容，劇本務求通俗化，因為通俗化的本身，原是啟蒙運動中很重要的一環；而舊瓶新酒的通俗化，又是通俗化問題中値得使人注意的一點。無疑地，大衆的精神上，所日常而又歡喜接近的，原是那一套舊形式的東西，這種舊形式的東西裏面，又包含着無數量的封建餘毒，不願放鬆；因此，舊飛式注入新內容，正是一種好方式來加速送葬殘留腦海中的舊思想。</p>
<p>至於改良的方式，筆者的意思，是採取緩進的。因為皮黃劇已有數百年的固蒂歷史，演出的方式，在觀衆的腦海中，有先入為主的深刻印象。譬如過去歐陽予倩編導的「梁紅玉」「漁夫恨」「桃花扇」等，都是很有意義的，可是對營業上講，顯然是失敗的，考其失敗的癥結，無疑地是病在改良方式太急進，太詩意，不能跟整個的舞台人勿相調和，小市民階級的平凡的觀衆不免失望了</p>
<p>平劇的最大缺點是沒有現時代的劇本和深刻顯明的對白，而表演方式上，也頗不够，但容易為觀衆接受，為了延續牠的生存，需要用種種新穎的手法去塡充。眼前的問題，是看誰能在這個過渡時期負起這項使命。</p>
<p>筆者是平劇的忠實同志，鑒於大時代的潮流所趨，覺得老大的皮黃劇，不能再墨守成法了。因此，不揣譾陋，聊陳鄙見，以作編排的參考。</p>
<h3>王玉蓉「讀書問題」</h3>
<p>— 柏坪</p>
<p>憶王玉蓉曩在南京作歌女時，因讀書問題轟動社會茲述其經過，以博讀者一粲。民國二十年間，王玉蓉尙在南京夫子廟飛龍閣茶社充歌女，每當華燈初上，搖曳登臺，所得代價，極為有限。時不佞在南京晚報編輯新聞版，一日接一新聞稿，謂有歌女王玉蓉者，改名在京華中學讀書，被學校當局發覺，常即開除云云，時家慧劍兄編輯南晚秦淮月，覩有此則新聞，憤然，謂歌女何以不能讀書，在專制時代倡優不能入學則有之，現代西方各國對歌劇家均視為高尙藝術，此種封建思想，實有抨擊之必要，於是首先發為文章，以促社會人士之注意，京中各報見之，均表同情，紛起響應，時平滬各報駐京記者，並將各報評論擇其最精彩句發為專電，蓋歌女能否讀書，竟成社會上一重大問題矣。</p>
<p>時南京京華中學為四川人傳况霖所私立，見各報攻擊甚烈，乃招待記者，大發其議論，謂王玉蓉來校讀書，初不知其為歌女，祇見其燙髮露大腿，華裝艷服，頗含誘惑性，嗣有酬應赴夫子廟，始知此生，即歌女王玉蓉，為整頓學風計，故有開革之必要云云。當時社會局方面，反認傳處置得當，而王玉蓉祇有犧牲其求學志願及其所繳之學費，所得者僅輿論界之同情。</p>
<p>旋玉蓉忽絕跡秦淮河畔，不知何往，有人詢及伊妹王玉琴，時玉琴亦夫子廟歌女，據謂伊姐實有志求學，並非虛偽，被學校開除後，在家常啜泣，抑鬱難平，今見讀書不能如願，決北上赴津平，投名師以求深造，冀成一名角，不數年，果見報載玉蓉已出演北平名園，頗能呌座，者番並由黃金邀伊南下繼演，一舉成名，所謂「有志者事竟成。」而伊人之立志求學，堅苦奮鬥之精神，實有足多者。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，不佞走滬，傭書為生，常見伊妹玉琴在霞飛路環龍路一帶，就南貨店購雜物，有時懷中抱一嬰兒，蓋已嫁人作家中婆，以視伊姐，則誠小巫見大巫也。</p>
<h3>介紹「香江歌女」</h3>
<p>— 古芬</p>
<p>「香江歌女」的劇情是敘述一個賣唱女子的可憐生活，這裏特別比彈性女兒」多挿入一點愛的成分，路明演來，的確相當可觀，這片値得一提的，是許多新人的加入，導演是孫敬，他第一次導演片子，手法很明潔，余琳。岳麟·嚴化·曹娥都做得很好。</p>
<p>當我們看了這片之後，有一種感覺，那些桃色職業羣中的許多缺少理智的可憐者，甘願做玩物那種所謂闊老們調情作樂，實在很使人嘆惜？在「香江歌女」後，我們相信祇少有一部人受其感動而轉變其人生觀的。所以我們願把這部作品介紹給交際塲合中的女性們</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Land Near Beihai; Chinese Defense Forces Inflict Heavy Blows, Annihilating Several Japanese Units; Chinese Troops in Southwestern Shanxi Achieve Consecutive Victories, Recapturing Villages</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: This morning, the 15th, taking advantage of inclement weather, Japanese troops launched a large-scale landing near Beihai, apparently with the aim of invading Yongning. Local garrison troops are bravely resisting, and the battle is ongoing. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: This morning, Japanese sources here officially announced that Japanese troops landed near Beihai in Guangdong Province this morning, attempting to seize the lifeline connecting Chongqing and French Indochina in order to cut it off. According to news from Macau, the Japanese troops in Beihai landed at 9:00 AM today. It is said that the Japanese army and navy landed without encountering resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese landing site was Longmen, 90 kilometers across the sea from Beihai. (15th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: At 6:05 AM this morning, twelve Japanese warships shelled Qisha in Fangcheng. Five minutes later, more than forty Japanese warships were added, continuing to bombard the coast, and several Japanese aircraft made low-flying strafing runs, seemingly attempting to land. At 8:00 AM, six Japanese warships with three smokestacks appeared off the coast of Guantou Ridge near Beihai, intensively shelling the shore and releasing smoke screens. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Naval Ministry declared that Japan's military operations in Beihai are aimed at intensifying the blockade of the South China coast. After the fall of Beihai, all Chinese seaports will fall into Japanese hands. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The authorities here are currently awaiting an official report from the Guilin Southwestern Theater regarding the news of the Japanese landing in Beihai. It is said that this was expected, as Chongqing has received news in the past few days that Japanese naval, land, and air forces have concentrated on the Guangxi coast. According to intelligence received by the Chinese authorities here, Japanese troops have concentrated 50 aircraft on Hainan Island and 24 on Weizhou Island. The main force of the Japanese Fourth Fleet is reportedly concentrated near Hainan Island. A total of more than 60 Japanese warships and transport ships have gathered near Beihai. According to the Chinese military authorities here, they do not feel troubled by the Japanese landing in Beihai, as they have long been prepared for it. It is now believed that the Japanese army, through aerial and ground bombardment, may be able to occupy Beihai without much difficulty, but it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese to invade the interior from Beihai, as all the roads in the area have been thoroughly destroyed. Moreover, the people's organizations in Guangxi Province are as famous as its army, and they will certainly put up a strong resistance to any Japanese attempt to invade the province. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a communiqué issued today by the Japanese General Headquarters, Japanese troops, under the cover of Japanese warships, landed near Beihai this morning. According to a Japanese dispatch from Hong Kong, Beihai has been occupied by Japanese troops, but official confirmation of this news has not yet been received. According to the communiqué issued by the General Headquarters, elite Japanese naval and land forces, in close cooperation, braved the adverse weather this morning and suddenly landed near Beihai in Tokyo Bay and are now advancing inland. The Army Department of the General Headquarters also issued a communiqué stating that elite army troops, in close cooperation with the navy, landed near Beihai at 6:00 AM today and immediately began to advance. In the past few days, the weather near Beihai has been bad, with strong winds and big waves. This morning, the wind speed reached 18 meters per second. According to a communiqué issued by the Naval Department of the General Headquarters, the fleet led by Vice Admiral Takasu, commander of the South China Naval Fleet, escorted army transport ships to the waters near Beihai before dawn today. Under the cover of naval gunfire, the army immediately began landing and is currently advancing inland. Today, the wind is strong and the waves are high, but all Japanese troops are in good spirits. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese military sources today, the Chinese coastal defense forces in Qinzhou Bay have annihilated several Japanese units that landed. Under the fierce bombardment of the Japanese navy and air force, they are putting up extremely strong resistance against the Japanese troops, who are now attempting to advance towards Beihai. However, the Chinese troops in Beihai are prepared to defend the area with all their might. According to a Chinese military spokesman, if the Japanese troops can advance further, they will encounter even stronger resistance. Furthermore, the news of the Japanese landing near Beihai was not surprising, as it is generally believed here that the Japanese goal in landing in Beihai is nothing more than (1) to disrupt the constructive atmosphere of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and (2) to create news of victory in order to recover their face after their great defeat in northern Hunan. It was also said that the Japanese could have taken Beihai two years ago, but they did not take it at the time, and it is now at a great disadvantage to attack it, because China has strong defenses in that area. Therefore, it will be difficult for the Japanese to advance easily. For example, the Japanese have occupied Xiamen and Shantou for a long time, but they still cannot penetrate deeply. Therefore, if Japan wants to cut off the transportation route between Guangxi and Annam, it must adopt a large-scale offensive, preparing to sacrifice a large part of its manpower and resources, before there is any hope. According to Chinese sources, the shortest distance from Beihai to the Guangxi-Vietnam Highway is 140 kilometers, and from Xisha (transliteration), 75 kilometers west of Beihai, to the highway is 120 kilometers. There are highways from Beihai and Xisha to Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, so the Japanese are obviously aiming to attack Nanning, but the Japanese wish will definitely not be fulfilled, because since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the Chinese side has long expected the Japanese to take this action. However, the Guangxi Muslims, under the leadership of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, believe that the defenses there are extremely strong and there is nothing to worry about. According to Chinese sources, there are currently 40 Japanese warships and one aircraft carrier anchored in Qinzhou Bay. At around 6:00 AM this morning, they first shelled Xisha (transliteration) at the tip of the peninsula and the surrounding villages and towns and the north, and then released a large amount of smoke screens and landed with 20 speedboats. The Chinese coastal defense forces also returned fire and resisted with all their might, wiping out several landing Japanese units. Later, the Japanese navy and air force frequently covered the Japanese troops, who were able to land. The Japanese landing this time benefited from its air force, as Japan, in addition to relying on the aircraft carrier anchored there as a base, also has a newly built airfield on Weizhou Island. At the same time, the Japanese navy concentrated there also accounts for one-third of the fleet in China. Furthermore, the recent Japanese action of forcing down a British Imperial Airways airliner on Weizhou Island was obviously a means by which the Japanese prepared to attack the mainland there, fearing that it would be discovered. (15th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui: Japanese warships shelled Qisha (southeast of Fangcheng) heavily. At around 3:00 PM, twelve Japanese boats full of Japanese soldiers landed near Longmen and are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>Guilin: Several Japanese aircraft flew over Hepu, Qin County, San Niang Bay, Di Jiao, Sha Jiao, and Beihai on the 13th to reconnoiter. (14th Telegram)</p>
<p>Xingji: A person from Taiyuan said that the Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi suffered another heavy blow, with a total of more than 10,000 casualties. Lieutenant General Joazuka, the commander of the Japanese army, recently telegraphed Nanking Japanese Commander-in-Chief Nishio for assistance in an attempt to retaliate. Division Commander Ushijima was indeed seriously wounded by the Chinese army near Changzhi and returned to his country for recuperation last month. (15th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Japanese troops besieged in Xiangning City launched a counterattack towards Fujia Village on the 13th and were defeated by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 14th, they launched a full-scale attack to the north, attempting to break through one point of the Chinese siege line. A bloody battle unfolded in the Pingyuan Village area, ten miles north of Xiangning City. Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely, heavily damaging the Japanese army. From morning until about 2:00 PM, although the Japanese fought hard and repeatedly released poison gas to cover their advance, they were completely defeated by the Chinese army and retreated south in disarray. When they reached the outskirts of Xiangning, they were intercepted by the Chinese army. The remnants of the Japanese army were unable to enter the city and fled in panic towards the southern mountains. At 6:40 PM, the Chinese army successfully recaptured Xiangning City and sent teams to pursue the retreating Japanese army and continue to search. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>Shaanzhou: After the Chinese army's consecutive days of sweeping operations against the Japanese army in the area north of Hongtun Road and west of Baijin Road in southeastern Shanxi, the remnants of the Japanese army fled in confusion and were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy casualties. At the moment, there is no trace of the Japanese in the area. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>Xingji: More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Taigu invaded southward on the 9th, reaching Baibi, north of Huixian, and were intercepted by the Chinese army. On the same day, more than 600 Japanese troops from Laiyuan also invaded Huixian from the east and fought against a certain Chinese unit. In the evening, the Japanese army fled to the East and West Xingzhuang, south of Huixian. The Chinese army launched a surprise attack under the cover of night, and the stalemate lasted until dawn on the 11th, when the Japanese attempted to break through to the west. After being attacked from the front and rear by the Chinese army, they returned to the old city of Dongxi Qingxiu, south of Dongxi Xingzhuang. More than 200 Japanese troops were urgently dispatched to reinforce, but were ambushed and defeated by the Chinese army. At the moment, the Chinese army is continuing to encircle and annihilate the remnants of the Japanese army. (14th Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Holds Its Third Meeting; Kong Xiangxi and Others Report on the Financial and Economic Situation; the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Agree on Wartime Plans</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its third meeting on the 15th. President Chiang presided over the meeting. After announcing the minutes of the second meeting, various reports were given, including reports by Committee Members Zhang Ji and Ma Chaojun on the comforting of troops at the front, a report by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on finance, and a report by Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao on the economy. After several hours of reports by various officials, the meeting adjourned. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources today, the issue of relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will not be mentioned at this Sixth Plenary Session, and the Japanese propaganda about friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be denied. It is said that there are no serious problems between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the two parties have the same views on all major wartime plans. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party also hold the same views on the issue of constitutionalism. This can be seen in the recent resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and in President Chiang's speech on Monday. There is also no question that the two parties agree to cooperate until the end of the Sino-Japanese War. Kuomintang authorities told a reporter from the Associated Press that the main content of this Sixth Plenary Session will be to review the work achievements of the past nine months, the government's policies and the direction of the War of Resistance, and that there will be no changes in government personnel. At yesterday's meeting, Executive Yuan President and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, and Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin gave reports on administration, diplomacy, and military affairs, respectively. Dai Jitao of the Examination Yuan and others were elected yesterday as chairmen of the declaration drafting committee. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Dead End of Japan's Eagerness to End the War Against China</h3>
<p>Recent public opinion in Japan and the expressions of officials have frankly stated their eagerness to end the war against China. Japan has been invading China for two years and four months. Apart from plundering some resources in the militarily occupied areas, destroying China's order and laws, and spreading evils such as opium and gambling, it has gained nothing. However, the consumption of huge amounts of manpower, material resources, and financial resources has already shaken the foundation of its domestic economy and society. Originally, the Japanese economy had only entered the stage of modern capitalism, and due to natural limitations, it could only focus on the development of light industry, completely relying on the maintenance of foreign trade. However, in this Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government's so-called wartime measures fundamentally blocked this normal economic activity. Strict control of foreign trade only caused the amount of imports and exports to decrease sharply, causing the production capacity of various industries to decline again and again. Although subsidy policies, commodity linkage systems, and improved trade administrative agencies were adopted to try to revitalize export trade and restore industrial activity through so-called rationing and control, the consumption of the war of aggression, which was beyond its capabilities, could not be remedied by human efforts. For example, recently the Japanese claimed that foreign trade had improved, believing that the control policy had been effective. In fact, Japanese trade has never improved. The increase in the amount of imports and exports and the conversion of the trade balance to a deficit are due to Japanese merchants dumping a large number of commodities in the exclusive military occupation areas and then plundering various commodities in the military occupation areas, exchanging them for large amounts of military currency and sending them to their home country. This is the truth of the so-called improvement. Various important commodities that it has always regarded as the most important markets in Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia, and which it boasts are the best in the world, are all continuing to decline. After the outbreak of the European war, Japan was not only isolated diplomatically, but also in an even worse economic situation. It is naturally very difficult to maintain trade with Europe and Southeast Asia as it did in the past, and the United States' gradual retaliatory actions against its so-called New Order in East Asia are a fatal blow to the Japanese economy. How much economic strength can it have to support a long-term war and maintain domestic social stability in the absence of foreign aid? I am afraid that no one in Japan with any sense of awareness does not understand this. The East Daily recently stated that Elder Saionji is currently worried about the domestic and international situation in Japan, which is an example. Then the recent propaganda to end the war against China is the anxious cry and internal demand of the Japanese people. As for Japan's attempt to develop foreign trade after the end of the war, taking advantage of the opportunity of the European war, this is only an incidental hope.</p>
<p>China and Japan are adjacent to each other, and economically, there is a close relationship of mutual benefit and reliance between them. If Japan had not resorted to violence, there would have been a possibility of equal cooperation. Unfortunately, Japan妄想destroyed China and monopolized the Far East, which led to today's great mistake. Japan only has some people with foresight who are worried about this great mistake, but have not thoroughly awakened to it. Therefore, it is still渺茫when they will be able to achieve their hope of ending the war! It is not China that is dragging it down. China has always been passively resisting the war. Although it has suffered from the tea毒of Japan and sacrificed countless lives and properties, the people are惨痛 and angry, and are united in their hatred of the enemy, but they have no demands on Japan. Recently, President Chiang stated in his address at the Sixth Plenary Session that China's national policy has always maintained four principles: (1) Opposing Japanese aggression to protect the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration; (2) Abiding by international conventions; (3) Not participating in anti-communist agreements; and (4) Complete independence and autonomy in diplomacy. This is peaceful, this is fair; whether it is about sentiment or reason, it is valid for the whole world; if Japan is awakened, if Japan hopes to end the war, it should accept these four principles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Japan only has some people with foresight who only know how to worry but never awaken; it thinks that the "New Order" can deceive international recognition, and the "New Regime" can deceive China into peace; deceive again and again, then it can deceive into annexing China and monopolizing the Far East; in fact, people with conscience and conscience, who would be ambiguous! For example, regarding the so-called New Order, the US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, very婉转ly explained that he would not be deceived, which is clear evidence. However, Japan still喃喃自语about this, 刺刺不休. We think that if the understanding is insufficient, or even goes astray, it is regrettable, and it can be saved. If it has been discovered that it cannot deceive people, but it is still 大吹大擂, it is deceiving itself. If it is deceiving itself and it doesn't matter, there is still something to say; now Japan is economically and militarily unable to maintain its policy of aggression, and it has already reached a state of 可忧可虑, this kind of deceiving oneself is 耽误 itself! If it delays itself and eats its own fruit, it is not worthy of pity. But we hope that Japan will not wait until it is too late to regret</p>
<h3>British and French Troops Withdraw from North China; US Policy Unaffected; US State Department Denies Protecting British Interests on Behalf of Britain</h3>
<p>Washington: The State Department here today specifically denied rumors that after the British government decided to withdraw British troops from North China, it asked the United States to come forward to protect British interests in China, and said that the United States' position in the Far East is not affected by the British and French troop withdrawal actions. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Official sources here have resolutely denied rumors that Britain will withdraw its troops from Shanghai, calling them unfounded. In addition, there are claims that the Japanese army in Tianjin has taken even stricter measures against the British Concession, and that coal supply has reportedly been cut off, which cannot be confirmed here at present. (15th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: This morning, the British and French troops stationed in Tianjin have not yet begun to withdraw. Foreigners are deeply stimulated by the British and French reduction of troops, while the Japanese army is still stationed opposite the British and French concessions. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Sources that have always been reliable stated today that, according to the plan to withdraw most of the British troops stationed in China, a squadron of the British troops stationed in Shanghai, the East Surrey Regiment, will be transferred to Tianjin to replace the Royal Welch Fusiliers. A platoon of the East Surrey will be transferred to Beijing to protect British interests. The military authorities here refused to confirm or deny this. Regarding the news that a company of the East Surrey Regiment is coming to Tianjin, they refused to comment. When the Royal Welch Fusiliers will leave Tianjin, the French troops preparing to withdraw have been ordered to sail elsewhere within three weeks. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Regarding Britain's withdrawal of troops from North China, the Washington Post here believes that it cannot be viewed as a common occurrence, but it would be too much to say that this action will have a major impact. Although Britain's withdrawal of its troops from North China will create new problems, Japan also has its own problems. First, the Soviet Union has always been Japan's hidden danger, and second, Japan's war in China is also in an unfavorable state. Because of the above reasons, both Japan and Britain are trying to maintain friendly relations. According to Simmons, a diplomatic correspondent for the American Howard newspaper chain, after Britain withdraws its troops from North China, the situation in the Far East may change rapidly, and American interests may be affected by the European War more directly and to a greater extent. Regarding the Netherlands' intention to ask the United States to protect its interests in the Far East, Simmons believes that the United States does not understand and cannot undertake this task, and is unwilling to bear this task, because this action is very different from the US national policy. (15th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The "English Chu Pao," the mouthpiece of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published an article yesterday expressing its deep fear that the British government's decision to withdraw troops from North China means that Britain intends to sell out China as the European War drags on. The newspaper pointed out that the news of the British troop withdrawal was met with great satisfaction by Japan, and hoped that the intensification of Japan's actions against China would force Britain to abandon its position in the Far East. In China, it will inevitably cause disappointment. The explanation given by the British side that the troop withdrawal is necessary for the European War is considered difficult to believe, especially the "maintenance of troops in necessary locations," is even more doubtful. In the past, the entire British garrison stationed in North China could not prevent the British expatriates in Tianjin from being humiliated again and again. Now, with only one team and one battalion remaining, hoping to protect the lives and property of expatriates is nothing short of self-deception. Regardless of whether this action represents another concession by Britain to Japan, China cannot but worry about Britain's Far East policy. (15th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain's Far East Policy Has Not Changed; Butler Answers Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London: At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Labour MP Baker referred to Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent remarks to a reporter from a Japanese newspaper and asked whether some of the words in this statement could be misunderstood as Britain having changed its attitude towards the Far East. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied, "The last paragraph of the statement involves the Far East. The original text is hereby sent to the members of the committee for review. The previous statement on the Far East policy has also been included in the Prime Minister's statement, so that it can be seen that our country's Far East policy has not changed. In addition, the speech recently delivered by US Ambassador to Japan Grew in Tokyo has been largely published. Foreign Secretary Halifax intends to ask Mr. Baker to review it. The British government is not in a position to issue a formal statement at this time." (15th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations on the Tianjin Incident Remain Stalled</h3>
<p>London: The diplomatic correspondent of The Times said that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin Incident are still stalled, and the two sides are only exchanging unofficial opinions that cannot bind the two governments. As for the silver stored in the British bank in Tianjin, the British government is prepared to accept a solution that can be agreed to by the Chinese National Government, but it is not prepared to take China's assets without the consent and permission of the owner to dispose of them. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Kwantung Army Remains Suspicious of the Soviet Union; Border Demarcation Issues Are Being Delayed</h3>
<p>Changchun: The Japanese and Manchukuo authorities here are now closely observing the progress in Europe, especially the situation related to the Soviet Union. Newspapers are also publishing news about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations and the recent situation in the Balkans in important positions. Although the Soviet Union is preoccupied with matters in the West and will not repeat the Nomonhan or Zhanggufeng incidents, the military authorities here still maintain a cautious wait-and-see attitude. The Kwantung Army remains suspicious of the Soviet Union, so it is always preparing to deal with any military action by Outer Mongolia or the Soviet Union. According to the military authorities here, there is still no possibility of understanding with the Soviet Union as recently reported in the newspapers, because Japan has long wanted to demarcate the borders between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union and between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia, and has done a lot of work on surveying the borders, but the Soviet side has taken no action and is only delaying. According to the Japanese, apart from the sea, the border of "Manchukuo" from the southern end of Outer Mongolia to the Sea of Japan is the border between Japan and the Soviet Union, not just the border between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia. The Japanese military authorities often ask themselves whether the Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan incidents and the Soviet Union's supply of arms to the rebels in the northern provinces of "Manchukuo" will continue to occur. The resentment of the Japanese military when Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression pact has not yet subsided. According to common speculation, this resentment will not dissipate for a while. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Lieutenant General Umezu, Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army and Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo," recently arrived in Tokyo from Changchun and was granted an audience with the Emperor of Japan at 10:30 this morning. Chief of the Army General Staff Prince Kan'in and Minister of War Junroku were in attendance. Umezu reported on the situation in "Manchukuo." In the afternoon, Umezu reported on the same matter to the Army Ministry and the General Staff. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Newspapers here recently carried news from Berlin that the general public in the Soviet Union is expecting that the Soviet Union and Japan can enhance their relations and hope that the two sides will quickly approach each other. There is also talk that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Tokyo next spring. (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here recently said that the Soviet Union, in the past few years, has been working hard to woo Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Now, it has changed its course and is working to mediate between Japan and the Soviet Union. The initial news about the mutual approach between Japan and the Soviet Union came from Berlin, which can be seen. In fact, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has not progressed much, as the German spokesman said. Those in Japan who are in favor of reconciliation with the Soviet Union are the ones who previously advocated that the Anti-Comintern Pact of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy be changed into a military alliance treaty. It can be seen that the reason why they suddenly changed their attitude towards the Soviet Union is still because they sympathize with Germany and listen to Germany's suggestions. According to well-informed sources, Japan and the Soviet Union are indeed conducting negotiations, hoping to resolve various county cases and thereby establish a new foundation for the relationship between the two sides. However, the main goal of the Japanese side is to get the Soviet Union to stop aiding China. In the view of foreign observers, there is no sign at the moment that the Soviet Union is prepared to abandon its great policy towards China. (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Meets Soviet Ambassador to Discuss Pending Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Nomura met with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin at the Foreign Ministry at 3:30 PM on the 15th. He stated his intention to promptly begin discussions regarding the revision of the temporary Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty and exchanged opinions on various pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union. The meeting lasted from 3:50 to 4:25 PM. Furthermore, regarding the issues of detained vessels, the confirmation of rights to oil in northern Sakhalin, and North Pacific fisheries between Japan and the Soviet Union, Ambassador Togo in Moscow and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov are conducting separate consultations. The majority of the detained vessel issue has already been resolved. It has been decided to convene a commission soon to specifically discuss the demarcation of the Manchurian-Mongolian border.

<p>Tokyo – A Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to a question from a foreign journalist this morning, stated that Japan is indeed pursuing a good-neighbor policy towards the Soviet Union, as advocated by President Roosevelt. Therefore, we do not understand why the American people hold feelings of unease and suspicion regarding the improvement of Japan-Soviet relations, as expressed in the New York dispatch reported in today's newspapers. Japan desires to establish friendly relations with its neighbor, the Soviet Union, naturally. We sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will reciprocate Japan's good-neighbor policy.

<h3>Japanese Army Promotes Rice Conservation; One Rice-Free Day Per Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Army Ministry and the General Staff held their first "Rice-Free Day" today to promote a national rice conservation movement. Minister of the Army Shunroku and 1,500 other officers and employees ate bread and pasta instead of rice for lunch. It has since been decided that every Wednesday will be a "Rice-Free Day." Government agencies, including divisional headquarters, will follow suit. An Army Ministry spokesperson said today that the shortage of rice in Japan is due to poor harvests in Korea and western Japan. If the entire nation can forgo eating rice for one day each month, it will not be difficult to cope with this shortage. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Sun Fo Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations in British House of Commons; Sir Leith-Ross to Host Dinner</h3>
<p>London – Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, delivered an interesting speech to the China Committee of the House of Commons last night. The committee members listened intently and asked many questions regarding Sino-Soviet relations. Sun Fo is scheduled to return to Paris on Friday. While residing at the Chinese Embassy here, Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi hosted a series of tea parties, allowing Sun Fo to meet with representatives of the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour parties, as well as journalists from major newspapers. On Sunday, Sun Fo had a lengthy conversation with British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill and gained a very satisfactory impression of the British government's attitude towards China. Sun Fo also had a long discussion with Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and former British Ambassador to China. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor who led a financial mission to China in 1935, will host a dinner on Thursday to introduce Sun Fo to President of the Board of Trade Stanley. The Chinese community in London is quite pleased with the results of Sun Fo's visit and believes that it will have a particularly good influence at a time when Japanese propaganda is very active.

<h3>Resignation Wave in Indian Congress Party Cabinet</h3>
<p>Shillong, India – The Assam Congress Party coalition cabinet resigned today. This is the last resignation among the eight Congress Party cabinets. The reason is dissatisfaction with the British policy towards India outlined in the recent White Paper presented by the Viceroy of India. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Philippines' Future: Filipinos to Decide; Quezon Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Manila – Today is the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. President Quezon, in a speech delivered during a military parade, stated, in essence, that the future of the Philippines will be entirely determined by Filipinos themselves. Quezon avoided talking about the issue of independence. Quezon also argued that because the retail business in the Philippines is entirely controlled by Chinese, Japanese, and Americans, the retail business should be Filipinized. However, Quezon also stated that Filipinization does not mean depriving foreigners of businesses already established in the Philippines, but only that Filipinos should also develop the retail business on the island. Vice President Osmena also gave a speech, stating, "Our political activities to fight for freedom have ended. The major issue we should pay attention to from now on is economic stability, which is a necessary condition for independence." Today, 11,000 Philippine Army soldiers, 5,000 military academy students, and 30,000 spectators celebrated the fourth anniversary of Philippine autonomy. (15th, United Press)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Secrets Continue to Be Exposed in a London Lawsuit; Lord Rothermere Once Offered Advice to Hitler</h3>
<p>London – During the continuing trial in the High Court of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against British press magnate Lord Rothermere for breach of contract, more interesting facts about negotiations with Hitler were revealed. The plaintiff's lawyer, Beyfus, asked the Earl, showing him an unpublished letter, "Did you not make a suggestion to Hitler in this letter, and if Hitler acted on this suggestion, would there not be a very violent reaction in Europe?" The Earl did not answer. Beyfus asked again and again. The Earl then said, "I don't think so." Beyfus continued, "In 1938, the Earl interfered in European affairs as he had done before, and on a larger scale." The Earl replied, "I do not admit this. At that time, I was only trying to avert war between the two peoples." The Earl's son, Harmesworth, who succeeded his father as chairman of the company that owns the Daily Mail and other newspapers, testified that he only knew the Princess as a friend of his father and did not know that she was an employee until only a month ago. The defendant's lawyer, Travers, began the Earl's concluding argument, saying that the Princess had brought a suit she knew to be dishonest, hoping to put pressure on the Earl to settle the case privately rather than disclose certain confidential letters. In fact, these letters would not harm the Earl's reputation, but merely contained information on confidential negotiations with the people of another country on a confidential matter. The Earl was deeply dissatisfied with the Princess's involvement of confidential matters in court. The Princess originally attempted to extort Harmesworth by threatening to disclose letters obtained from his father. The plaintiff's lawyer, Beyfus, argued that the Princess had to keep them, and it was incredible that the Earl did not know that the Princess had copies. The judge said that the letters from Hitler did not contain anything disreputable or contradict his statements at the time, and neither did the letters from Lord Rothermere. The case was adjourned for further hearing. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – In the case of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against Lord Rothermere for breach of contract, Justice de Yu of the High Court ruled in favor of Lord Rothermere today, on the grounds that Lord Rothermere had not stipulated that he had to guarantee the Princess's political reputation or pay her £5,000 per year.

<h3>German Government Replies to Dutch and Belgian Peace Mediation with Sympathy; Declares It Will Not Be Coerced by Force; Expresses Difficulty Accepting British and French Conditions</h3>
<p>Berlin – The Belgian and Dutch ministers to Germany visited the German Foreign Ministry yesterday. Officials in charge of the Foreign Ministry informed the two ministers of the content of Germany's reply to the peace appeal of the two countries. It is understood that the German reply will be officially delivered to the Kings of Belgium and the Netherlands in The Hague and Brussels this morning. (15th, Haitian Press)</p>
<p>The Hague – The "Electricity News" here recently reported that German leader Hitler's reply to the notes of the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands has been sent to the two governments through diplomatic channels. The content expresses sympathy for the two heads of state's attempt to mediate peace, but declares that Germany will find it difficult to accept the conditions put forward by Britain and France. The actions of Britain and France have completely closed the door to a peaceful solution. If they wish to strive for peace, they only need to issue a declaration stating that they are happy to end the war and are prepared to negotiate peace terms. However, under the current circumstances, if Germany were to take action to restore peace, it would inevitably be misunderstood as succumbing to force, which Germany would not be happy to do. In addition, German political figures are extremely indignant at Britain and France's demand for the restoration of the complete sovereignty and freedom of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

<h3>Germany Threatens to Attack Foreign Armed Merchant Ships; Will Treat Them the Same as Warships; Several British Ships Continue to Be Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin – A spokesman for the German Naval High Command met with foreign reporters yesterday afternoon to explain Germany's attitude towards foreign armed merchant ships, pointing out that according to international conventions, armed merchant ships should in principle be regarded as warships and treated the same as warships. A reporter asked, based on German newspaper reports, what treatment would be given to the "Mauretania," which is now in the port of New York and has been armed. The spokesman replied that the ship would be treated the same as a warship in the Atlantic. The reporter asked if the installation of cannons on the ship could be regarded as purely defensive measures. The spokesman replied that international law does not have such a stipulation, and that under normal circumstances, merchant ships and passenger liners have no reason to be attacked, nor is there any need to defend themselves. Therefore, the installation of cannons indicates an intention to attack. (15th, Haitian Press)</p>
<p>London – The British ship "Madeira" (8,000 tons) exploded in the North Sea last night and sank immediately. Two crew members were killed and twenty-two were injured. The captain and the remaining crew were rescued. (14th, Havas)</p>
<p>London – The British armed fishing vessel "Cresswell" (275 tons) was sunk by a German submarine in the northern waters of Scotland today. Three crew members are missing, and the other ten were rescued two hours after the incident. The German submarine captain told the British fishing vessel captain, "German submarine officers and soldiers are not cruel murderers. Please convey this to your First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill." (14th, Havas)</p>
<p>The Hague – According to reports from London, three ships have sunk in the same location in the past three days after accidentally hitting wrecks in the water. One is named "Drayton," and the names of the other two have not been announced. All the people on board were rescued. (15th, Haitian Press)</p>
<p>London – The Admiralty announced yesterday that after a British destroyer struck a mine and sank, four of the six people reported missing have now been found safe and sound, and one is seriously injured. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Ship Sedana Sinks Without Apparent Cause</h3>
<p>London – The British Admiralty announced that the British-Indian liner Sedana (7,745 tons), which sank two days ago en route to Singapore, appears to have struck a mine due to negligence in entering a British minefield. The ship capsized within 15 minutes, killing 15 Asian passengers on deck and leaving another nine missing. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Takes Great Risks; Successful Reconnaissance Flights Over Germany; Takes Multiple Photos of Fortresses Deep Inside Territory</h3>
<p>London – The British Air Force has taken hundreds of photos of German towns, harbors, and military destinations in recent weeks. British planes have penetrated more than 200 miles into German territory several times. Although they have encountered active resistance from German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, they have ultimately returned with photos. More than 100 of these photos show military targets in great detail and contain extremely important information. This was taken during a reconnaissance flight in good weather. Another time, photos were taken of 16 airfields and the fortified areas of Emden and Hamburg. The total distance of each flight rarely fell below 800 miles. Very few planes did not fly back safely. One British plane, when targeting an airfield during its reconnaissance flight, flew so low that it passed under two German bombers that were about to land at the airfield. Another time, a British plane flew so high that the crew had to rely on oxygen supply equipment to breathe. The British Air Force is responsible for this dangerous work, and it is easy to be attacked by the enemy and face the natural dangers of winter flight, so occasional losses are expected. One British plane was flying at a high altitude at a temperature of 20 degrees below zero. When it reached its destination and flew back, the fuselage was hit by anti-aircraft fire. The gunner was injured, and the lookout removed his parachute straps, life preserver, and coat, squeezed himself through a narrow gap in the frame to the gunner's seat, wrapped the injury, and comforted him until they flew out of German territory, then returned to his lookout seat and resumed his lookout duties. This lookout did not wear a coat in the freezing temperature throughout the flight back from Germany. Such brave behavior is to be seen in the Air Force. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>German Planes Actively Operating; Reconnaissance Over Shetland Islands; Leaflets Distributed in Paris</h3>
<p>London – A German reconnaissance plane was seen again in the skies over the Shetland Islands before dusk yesterday. This was the third time within 24 hours that a German plane had flown over the island. In the previous two attacks, the German planes dropped at least 12 bombs, estimated to weigh 500 pounds each. A seven-pound piece of shrapnel hit a small shed. Four bombs landed in the sea without causing damage. Four bombs fell less than a quarter of a mile from a school, and another four fell on a hilltop three miles away. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris – It was rumored that a plane of unknown nationality flew over the city yesterday, dropping leaflets containing a speech by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. This has now been confirmed, and it is known that the leaflets were printed in Germany, indicating that the plane was German. (14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British and French Finance and Economy Expand Cooperation Scope; Finance Ministers' Meeting Results in Complete Agreement</h3>
<p>London – After two conversations between French Finance Minister Reynaud and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Reynaud boarded a plane and returned to his country this afternoon. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>London – The Treasury released a communiqué stating, "French Finance Minister Reynaud, at the invitation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, arrived in London on the 13th of this month with a group of officials and held talks. Both sides agreed that the UK and France should continue to cooperate closely in economic and financial matters. A review of the current cooperation methods was carried out, and it was decided to maintain and expand their scope. Several issues of a general and technical nature were also discussed. The opinions were completely consistent. At the conclusion of the talks on the 14th, Finance Minister Reynaud suggested that opinions be exchanged frequently in the future to maintain continuous contact, and Chancellor Simon expressed his deep sympathy." (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>London – French Finance Minister Reynaud has arrived in London for a short stay and will discuss various financial and economic issues arising from the war with the British authorities. In a broadcast speech, Reynaud said, "Our big problem is to bravely cope with the needs of the war. France now needs more foreign exchange. At the beginning of the war, everyone had the greatest confidence that our country would win. Today, we still do. France has a clear and firm determination to join the war, so that this war can ensure that future wars will never happen again, and it is gratifying that the British people also have the desire to achieve true peace."

<h3>German-Dutch Situation Eases; Rumor that US Ambassador Told Netherlands that It Will Provide Moral Support</h3>
<p>Paris – Although the tension between Belgium and the Netherlands towards Germany has eased slightly, observations from the air have revealed that there have been no major changes in the concentration of German troops on the Belgian border. The general opinion here is that Hitler will repeatedly use tactics to keep small countries in a constant state of alarm. As for the reason for the current easing of the tense situation, Italian newspapers have cited four points: (1) the nature of Dutch Foreign Minister Kiel's broadcast speech on Sunday (Kiel's speech solemnly declared that recent military measures were not due to an increase in danger, but only for prevention); (2) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's meeting with the Belgian Ambassador in Berlin; (3) the German ambassador's visit to Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak; (4) the US Minister to The Hague's audience with the Queen of the Netherlands. It is rumored that the US Minister had an audience at the request of the Queen of the Netherlands. (13th, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Hague – Some newspapers here have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's military measures, which have caused nationwide panic. According to foreign observers, the reason for the Dutch government's unease is that Germany is mobilizing troops near the Dutch border and that the National Socialist Party is carrying out large-scale activities within the Netherlands. Domestic dynamics are easy to control, while German pressure from abroad naturally threatens the Netherlands. Residents who had previously fled to the capital from the border area have now returned to their hometowns. In addition, US Minister to the Netherlands Gordon paid a visit to Queen Wilhelmina on the 12th of this month. The content of the conversation has not been officially released, but according to well-informed sources, this matter is very important. Minister Gordon is said to have presented a letter from President Roosevelt to Queen Wilhelmina. From this, it can be seen that if the Netherlands is invaded or unreasonably oppressed, it will certainly receive active sympathy from the United States. The current easing of the situation is probably due to this. (14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Foreign Traffic Apparently Not Completely Severed; Difficult to Fill Holes in the British Blockade; Progress in German-Soviet Economic Talks</h3>
<p>London – According to observations here, the British economic blockade of Germany has many defects. Although German ships at sea have been cleared by the British Navy, Germany's foreign lines of communication have apparently not been severed. The Netherlands, Belgium, and the Nordic countries are all loopholes in the British blockade. In addition, the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries can supply Germany with food, oil, manganese, livestock, and minerals, and Swedish iron seedlings can also be continuously exported to Germany. Recently, Germany sent a trade delegation to the Swedish capital to discuss ways to increase Swedish exports to Germany. In addition to its own economic assistance to Germany, the Soviet Union's trans-Eurasian Siberian Railway can also be used by Germany to import Manchurian soybeans, completely free from British control. According to diplomatic sources here, Soviet railways are broad-gauge, while German railways are narrow-gauge. However, Germany is rushing to build new vehicles to overcome this transportation obstacle, and the wheel disks can be arbitrarily enlarged and reduced. They can run on German railways and can also be forced to stay on Soviet railways without any hindrance. After these vehicles are completed, they can reach the border of Manchuria for Germany to transport soybeans. At the same time, Italy is also using its neutral position to conduct large-scale trade with Germany. Although the British authorities in Gibraltar also carry out the same inspections on Italian ships, due to the presence of a strong Italian navy in the Mediterranean, it is not possible to seek special concessions to achieve delay. This is also one of the loopholes in the blockade against Germany. (15th, United Press)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to Goering's mouthpiece, the "Aisen City National Daily," German-Soviet economic negotiations have now entered a new stage. Part of the German delegation negotiating in Moscow has returned home to participate in business discussions in Berlin. The rest are staying in Moscow, maintaining close contact with the Soviet government. Once the Berlin talks are over, all German representatives will return to Moscow to continue negotiations.

<h3>Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Stall but Do Not Break Down; Finnish Delegation Returns Home for Instructions; Says Soviet Union Never Threatened</h3>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish delegation that held negotiations with the Soviet government in Moscow has returned here today. Finnish Finance Minister Tanner, one of the important delegates, told people after arriving here that the negotiations had been conducted cordially throughout, with no threats or ultimatums. The negotiations did not break down. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – Diplomatic sources here said that according to reliable sources, the Soviet Union does not want to conquer Finland by force, but rather to destroy the country's resistance through psychological warfare. In other words, Soviet troops should be constantly concentrated near the Finnish border, thereby taking a psychological offensive while waiting for Finland to weaken on its own. In addition, Soviet officials insist that Finland's decision to resist is purely due to encouragement from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Soviet diplomatic authorities are therefore likely to strive to urge the British government to advise Finland and the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula to take a more compromising attitude, while also requesting that Britain agree to greatly increase the amount of trade between the UK and the Soviet Union. It is worth noting that the British government submitted a list to the Soviet Union three weeks ago detailing the various goods that the UK could export to that country, but the Soviet government has not yet responded for some reason. (14th, Havas)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Since the government began raising 50 million Finnish marks in national defense bonds, it has only been a few days, and the amount of public subscriptions has already exceeded the predetermined amount. According to general estimates, the total amount of private subscriptions and voluntary donations is no less than 100 million marks. In addition, the government representative sent to the Soviet Union returned yesterday. Although the Soviet Union has issued news that Finnish morale has been greatly depressed as a result, in fact the people remain calm as usual and have full confidence in the future situation. Most of the citizens of the capital who had been ordered to evacuate have recently returned, and their calmness can be seen from this. (11th, Havas)</p>
<p>Helsinki – It was rumored that several Soviet planes had flown over the Finnish city of Viipuri, and one of them had been shot down by Finnish anti-aircraft guns. Responsible officials here recently denied this. (15th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Pan-American Financial Conference: U.S. Representative Expresses Views</h3>
<p>Guatemala City, Guatemala, America—The Pan-American Financial Conference held a plenary session yesterday. Representatives from nineteen countries attended. The U.S. chief representative, Gaston, immediately expressed his views, stating that the countries of North, Central, and South America should use the monetary agreement of England, France, and the United States as a blueprint to conclude a Pan-American financial agreement, establishing a foundation for regular cooperation among the finance ministries of the American countries. He said, "Our Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau, having observed the operation of the monetary agreement among England, France, and the United States, is very satisfied that the finance ministries of the signatory countries are in contact with each other daily. It is now time to pay special attention to the monetary policies, exchange affairs, and banking policies implemented by the American republics over the past decade." After Gaston finished speaking, the plenary session elected three committees to discuss the issues of gold standard currency value stability, the removal of trade barriers, and the improvement of mutual contact and loan amounts among the central banks of the respective countries.

<h3>Major Earthquake Occurs in Eastern United States</h3>
<p>New York—A very serious earthquake occurred in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware. North America has not experienced such a major earthquake in many years.

<h3>Roosevelt Asks Congress for Additional Temporary Funding of $271 Million for Various Expenses to Safeguard Neutrality</h3>
<p>Washington—President Roosevelt recently told reporters that he has submitted a bill to the Finance Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives requesting an additional temporary appropriation of $271 million. This covers the various expenses incurred by the government to safeguard neutrality since the outbreak of the European war. Of this amount, $119 million is for the Army, $146 million for the Navy, $4.5 million for the Coast Guard, and $1.5 million for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington—Under Secretary of State Welles recently told reporters that the Minister of the Republic of Southern Ireland to the United States has requested the U.S. government to revise the war zone designated by President Roosevelt so that American ships can continue to sail to Southern Ireland. The scope of the war zone was determined by the President after deliberation with the relevant cabinet ministers. Because the Republic of Southern Ireland has made this request, the State Department is conducting further thorough research and has not yet made a decision. President Roosevelt also stated that the neutral countries along the Baltic coast and the Scandinavian peninsula, as well as the people of the Netherlands and Belgium, have protested against the war zone he designated. In reality, there is a definite danger if American ships continue to navigate as usual within this zone. His intention is simply to prevent attacks on American ships. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Polish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Consult with British Authorities to Review the Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>London—Polish Prime Minister General Sikorski and Foreign Minister Zaleski flew to London from Paris yesterday. This afternoon, they held talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax and attended a dinner hosted by the British government in the evening. It is reported that during the talks between the Polish cabinet members and Foreign Secretary Halifax, they reviewed the general situation and the diplomatic situation arising from the cooperation between Poland and its allies, England and France. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources said that the future of Poland is a delicate issue. For example, when Poland is restored in the future, England and France should not be forced to fight against the Soviet Union in order to recover the regions of Belarus and Ukraine. It is only that the responsibility for the war should be entirely attributed to Germany, and Germany should cede territory as compensation. The Polish authorities understand this situation and are well aware that it is not appropriate to make specific demands at this time; everything must depend on the circumstances. Currently, the most important thing for the Polish cabinet members is how Poland can cooperate militarily with its allies, England and France. Several Polish warships have already been incorporated into the British fleet and are patrolling in the North Sea. Prime Minister Sikorski will inspect them. The Polish army is currently training in France, and Poland's approximately £20 million in gold can also be used by England and France when necessary. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Two German Ships Attempt to Break Blockade, Ultimately Intercepted by British Ships</h3>
<p>London—Qualified sources here claim that the German ships "Mecklenburg" and "Panara," while returning to Germany, attempted to reach Norwegian territorial waters by taking advantage of bad weather and northern fog, but were intercepted by British ships. This is another clear demonstration of the efficiency of British naval patrols. When the "Mecklenburg" was intercepted by a British ship two days ago, it disguised itself as the Dutch ship "Hogkerk." Both German ships had previously taken refuge in South American ports. When intercepted, the crew scuttled the ships to avoid capture. The reason German merchant ships are now leaving their neutral ports of refuge is that they are willing to accept total losses rather than continue to pay anchorage fees, due to Germany's lack of foreign currency. German merchant ships are now using various strategies to try to quietly pass through British naval patrols. Some German ships have escaped British naval patrols, but the return of German ships to Germany is of little use to Germany because, except for the Baltic Sea, all other seas are controlled by Britain.

<h3>Northern Route Comfort Mission Returns to Ningxia from Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Somewhere in western Suiyuan—The Northern Route Comfort Mission arrived here from Wuyuan on the morning of the 12th and held a comfort rally for the soldiers at the front. He Zhonghan and Lao She delivered speeches, reporting the sympathy of the people in the rear and expressing words of encouragement. The officers and soldiers were extremely excited.

Since departing from Chongqing on June 28th, it has traveled over 16,500 li, presented banners and funds to the soldiers, and delivered comfort speeches to over [redacted] tens of thousands of officers and soldiers. The entire delegation, from Xiangfan in the south to Wuyuan in the north, from Luoyang in the east to Qinghai in the west, was most impressed by: (1) The anti-Japanese regime will become increasingly consolidated in the future; (2) The morale of the soldiers at the front is high and their beliefs are firm; (3) Soldiers have made rapid progress in political awareness and combat skills; (4) There is very little reliance on foreign aid or even rear support; everything is done to be self-reliant and fight independently; (5) The military and the people are united as one, and officers and soldiers love each other like brothers; (6) The entire Northwest is united, and the divisions between ethnic groups and religions no longer exist; (7) Active production has become a common practice; (8) The need for cultural sustenance, private capital, and technical talent is extremely acute; (9) Gansu, Chahar, Qinghai, and Suiyuan have sparse populations and abundant resources, requiring large-scale immigration. The delegation will return to Ningxia from western Suiyuan after the 13th, planning to return to Chongqing via Pingliang and Xi'an. (13th)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Slogans Found Again in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Beiping—Travelers arriving here reported that the Japanese side has tightened restrictions on the obstacles leading into the British concession in Tianjin. The blockade completed five months ago has now become "illegal profiteering," as those who want to pass quickly must pay a price, with varying fees. Coolies pay a few cents, while cargo trucks must pay over a hundred yuan. At the same time, anti-British activities, reportedly due to the suspension of funding, have been quiet for a week, but anti-British slogans have now been found again in Beiping. Morrison Road, Donghua Gate Road, Hadamen Road, and others are plastered with these slogans. Although newly printed, the wording is still familiar from before, such as "Down with Britain," "Exclude the British," and "Resist the British," all written in English. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Wartime European March - Special Correspondence from London - The British Empire Enters the War</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Indeed, Britain had no choice but to fight. - Reaching the point where it had no choice but to fight, in a situation where it had to fight, encountering the opportune moment to fight. Strictly speaking, now is already too late to fight. It has lost its most powerful ally, the Soviet Union, the heroic Spanish Republican government, Austria, the well-equipped Czechoslovakia, and Albania. The losses on this side represent the opposite, an increase in strength, on the enemy's side. The weakening and strengthening of this force, in Britain, has been deeply felt in the diplomatic blunders of the past few months. The traditional initiative of the British Empire on the European continent since the last great European war suddenly disappeared. Replacing it was the distrust of most countries towards Britain, except for France. In common parlance, it is the so-called "decline in prestige". As a result, in Britain's recent diplomatic negotiations, it has encountered unprecedentedly thorny situations and a sense of helplessness. Perhaps only the British government authorities involved can truly appreciate the bitterness within. According to the British authorities, this situation is attributed to the effects of German and Italian counter-propaganda. However, facts speak louder than words. The German and Italian propaganda machines repeatedly predicted that Britain was preparing to sell out the interests of other countries and succumb to aggressor nations, and later, just like Britain predicted the aggressive steps of Germany and Italy, they all came true one by one! In fact, why wait for the subsequent facts to prove it? In reality, even before the final revelation, Britain was always full of various activities. Trying to conceal all these activities from others and prevent them from knowing anything is fundamentally impossible, so why must the German and Italian propaganda machines expose them?</p>
<p>Germany and Italy recently predicted Britain's betrayal of Poland again, at a time when the war had not yet officially broken out. If Britain did not resolve to fight again, then the situation at that time would also be very clear: it would immediately lose Poland as an ally. After Poland was finished (whether it was an ally of Germany and Italy or a dependency of Germany and Italy), France would be next to become a target of aggression. The question of France is equivalent to the question of Britain; if the day of reckoning arrives for the French Empire, then the day of reckoning for the British Empire will arrive as well! However, the ultimate strategy of Chamberlain and his ilk in Britain is to abandon the British Isles altogether and move the capital to Canada in the event of necessity. These words sound alarming; however, this is by no means a masterpiece of Goebbels in Germany; the author of this, without any discount, is in the British Isles! Moreover, this is by no means an accidental utterance of a few individuals; the theoretical basis and detailed methods, if written in outline, would probably take several thousand words. Because it involves too much, I will not elaborate here.</p>
<p>My main point here is to explain that once Poland is finished, the next thing is the fate of England and France themselves. Following this line, it is very clear that it will inevitably lead to the collapse of the British Empire. Therefore, far-sighted people in Britain immediately won national support for their proposal, and Britain had no choice but to step forward and fight. - Even if Italy and Spain participate in the war, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It is already too late to fight now, but if we don't fight now, then things will be even worse later! So, if we are to fight, Britain has decided to fight now. - This is only one side of the issue.</p>
<p>However, there is another, more important side. During the Abyssinian question a few years ago, Britain could have fought, but it didn't; in the Spanish question, it also had the necessity of fighting or being willing to fight, but it sat idly by: the Austrian question, the Czech question, and this year's annexation of Albania were all major threats to its imperial interests, and each time, with the strong support of the Soviet Union and France, it was the best time for it to go to war. However, not only did it not fight, but on the contrary, it helped Germany and Italy repeatedly break up the cooperation and joint action between France and the Soviet Union. Now, in a situation where Germany and the Soviet Union have suddenly buffered, militarily speaking, the position of England and France is the most unfavorable it has been in these years, yet it has decided to start a war! Why is this?</p>
<p>Narrating in this way, we seem to have reached the crux of the matter; what kind of views and expectations did the British Empire have when it entered this war?</p>
<p>What attracts our attention very much at the beginning is the view of the far-sighted people in Britain, (by which I mean the group represented by Churchill, Eden, Halifax, and others,) on the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact." In the article above, I said that if Britain believed that the Soviet Union and Germany would truly form an alliance, then this war could not be fought. Now that I think about it, I didn't exaggerate at all; on the contrary, I would add another sentence: if Britain once discovered that the Soviet Union and Germany "truly" had a tendency to "ally," then I think that it would probably be the eve of the end of the war. This is just a hypothesis for the sake of explanation, which may be absolutely impossible in essence. Therefore, few people in Britain today believe in the "alliance" theory of the Soviet Union and Germany that is being spread by the propaganda and public opinion organs of England and France; that kind of statement is intended for people of other countries to see, and its effect is: to disappoint countries that originally had hopes for the Soviet Union; and to disappoint countries that originally had hopes for Germany. Therefore, in the international atmosphere of widespread disappointment with the Soviet Union and Germany, there is no doubt that there should be something else to be done, which should be the diplomacy of England and France.</p>
<p>The estimation of the future relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, in form, seems to be similar to what Prime Minister Chamberlain said in Parliament: "It has no influence at all". But in reality, we must know that this is one of the most fundamental factors when Britain decides its attitude.</p>
<p>Hitler, with the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact" in one hand, directed his army to attack Poland. At that time, he indicated to Britain that this time his target was only Poland and had nothing to do with Britain; but on the other hand, Ciano persuaded Beck that England and France would not fight for Poland at this time, so the best plan was to compromise with Germany. If Britain had decided to fight at this time, then in the blink of an eye, Poland would have become an ally of Germany.</p>
<p>Poland's attitude wavered. But British diplomacy began to be active, supporting Poland and fighting together.</p>
<p>The situation is very obvious, such a danger exists; what if Poland is finally defeated by Germany? In that case, would Britain's current decision not be a self-inflicted annoyance?</p>
<p>The answer is absolutely no. The reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) If Poland is defeated and annexed, then an annexed Poland means adding an internal contradiction and burden to Germany. However, if a German-Polish compromise is reached and an alliance is formed, then it means that Britain has another emerging opponent in the battlefield of international demand for the redistribution of world resources. Which is the lesser of the two evils? It is obvious at a glance. (2) Poland has more than one million troops, and they are quite modernized. It goes without saying that Germany wants to thoroughly defeat them and must prepare for considerable consumption. (3) If the war is prolonged, friction between Italy and Germany over this matter will increase. (4) Under Germany's storm-like aggression, all the small countries of Southeastern Europe will panic. When Poland is in danger, they can of course automatically rise up to help Poland. (5) And the most important point is that once the Soviet Union and Germany lose such a powerful barrier as Poland is now, in any case, the future will be a time of turmoil. In any case, these two of Britain's greatest enemies will have to divide a part of their gaze of hostility towards Britain and look at each other.</p>
<p>It is not yet known whether these expectations on the British side can be fully realized. However, when Poland responded to the war, Britain had already achieved half of its current hope; when England and France simultaneously declared war on Germany, permanently closing the door to a German-Polish compromise, Britain's wishes at this stage have been fully realized.</p>
<p>Poland has already started to fight, and it should always fight on like this. - For its own sake, and for the sake of England and France.</p>
<p>The focus of everyone's attention at the moment is probably: how will Britain actually help Poland? Some time ago (and it is still being rumored now), it was said that England and France were preparing to immediately send a large number of expeditionary forces by sea to Poland when the war broke out, landing in Poland by way of the small countries of Northern Europe and Romania. Now, judging from various signs, this rumor is probably in vain. Moreover, under the circumstances of the strict neutrality of the Northern European countries and Romania, this plan, even if it exists, cannot be realized. At present, Britain's aid to Poland, according to the semi-publicly rumored plan here, is probably concentrated in two aspects: one is the support of the air force, and the other is loans. According to Poland itself, it can buy a large number of armaments from the Soviet Union. In short, in the future, the sincerity of England and France in helping Poland should be judged by the extent to which these two aspects are achieved in that stage.</p>
<p>Militarily speaking, without the participation of the Soviet Union, and in the situation where the rest of the Southeastern European countries and the Northern European countries do not participate in the war, Poland's response to the war against Germany has a political effect that far outweighs the military effect. This is a sacrificial and political war. It is probably absolutely impossible to win against Germany alone. In this stage, if the latter three kinds of international situations listed above finally arise as Britain wishes, then it should be said that it is the most ideal result, otherwise, we might as well be honest and say: the direction of Britain's war against Germany will have to be somewhat erratic. But erratic is not a retreat, on the contrary, because the direction is erratic, those helmsmen who are in charge of the British Empire's advance will have to seek a way out in advance in this turbulence.

<h3>Resolutions of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Conference: Reorganizing County Education Administration, Providing Relief to Unemployed Educators in Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>(Xinghua Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, in order to promote education in the province, specially convened a provincial education conference in Xinghua in September. Attendees included principals of provincial secondary schools, directors of county education bureaus, section chiefs and supervisors from counties where the bureau had been abolished, principals of county-run secondary schools, principals of private secondary schools, principals of provincial elementary schools, and relevant education personnel, totaling eighty-two people. Director Ma Yuanfang presided over the meeting, presenting reports and leading discussions.

Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Educational Administration Group</p>
<p>(1) The educational administrative organizations in counties of this province that have become war zones lack consistent standards for establishing bureaus, setting up sections, or merging sections. A draft of regulations for the wartime educational administrative organizations of counties in this province has been proposed, specifying standards for the educational administrative institutions in fully occupied and recovered counties. Is this feasible? Please discuss. Resolution: Amended and passed. (2) Education administration supervisors in guerrilla areas of this province cannot fully oversee their responsibilities. A section chief should be specially appointed within the county government to take charge, in order to facilitate progress. (3) Adjust and promote education administration in occupied counties. (4) Reform the local education supervision system. (5) Education committees should still be universally established in occupied areas. Please decide. (6) In occupied counties, in order to enhance the effectiveness of supervision, the full-time education committee system should be restored. (7) Education committees should still be established in occupied counties in order to strengthen supervision and liaison, and to increase educational effectiveness. (8) It is proposed to add one education committee member to occupied counties to facilitate supervision. (9) In occupied areas, roads are dangerous and schools are numerous, making county supervision exceptionally difficult. It is imperative to specify the number of education committee members in order to facilitate inspection. Resolution: The above eight proposals are combined for discussion. The main proposal is changed to "Adjusting the Educational Administrative Institutions of Various Counties," and it will be handled according to the temporarily regulations for wartime educational administrative organizations in this province, as amended and passed in the first proposal. (10) Drafted herein are notes on matters that county magistrates and education bureau chiefs in Jiangsu Province should address during wartime. Please discuss. Resolution: Amended and passed. (11) Education personnel in occupied areas who do not betray their principles should be given awards. Resolution: Passed. Please have the Education Department formulate award measures and announce them for implementation. (12) Since the start of the war of resistance, the central government has not issued clear laws or regulations for punishing and offering rehabilitation to education personnel who have collaborated with the enemy. In order to facilitate the punishment and handling of collaborationist personnel, a set of provisional measures for the punishment and rehabilitation of collaborationist education personnel in Jiangsu Province has been drafted. Is it feasible? Please discuss. (Resolution) Amended and passed. (13) The Education Department has successively issued education plans for various occupied counties, provisional measures for the restoration of elementary schools at all levels in occupied counties, provisional measures for the establishment of village private schools in occupied counties, and provisional measures for operating wartime mobile schools in occupied counties. Are there any difficulties in implementing these in the occupied areas? Should they be supplemented? Please discuss. Resolution: If there are difficulties, each county shall submit a separate report to the Department for approval. (14) A plan to destroy the enemy's puppet education is being drafted. Please discuss. Resolution: Amended and passed. (15) Please find ways to provide relief to education personnel in occupied areas. (16) Provide relief to unemployed teachers. (17) How to provide relief to unemployed teachers in occupied areas. Resolution: The above three proposals are combined for discussion, with the thirteenth proposal as the main proposal. Please instruct the Education Department to order fully counties to appropriate funds from the surplus of education funds for the relief of unemployed education personnel in occupied areas. The relief measures shall be formulated by each county and submitted to the Education Department for implementation. (18) How should graduates of secondary schools who are unable to continue their education be assisted? Resolution: Forwarded to the Department for reference. (19) How should schools at all levels in this province thoroughly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant? (20) Please stipulate that the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant be the main content of moral education in all schools, and formulate detailed implementation measures. (21) Schools at all levels should intensify spiritual training. Resolution: The above three proposals are combined for discussion, with the seventeenth proposal as the main proposal. The key points for the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization and the National Covenant in schools at all levels in Jiangsu Province, as proposed in the seventeenth proposal, are amended and passed. (22) In the occupied areas, under the increasingly urgent encirclement of the enemy and puppets, all schools should minimize formal schooling and focus on content. Improving private schools and self-study tutoring groups should be vigorously encouraged and promoted. Their teaching, management, training, etc., should be handled in the same way as schools. Please decide. Resolution: Refer to and handle according to the provisions of the notes on matters that county magistrates and education bureau chiefs should address during wartime, as passed in the tenth proposal. (23) In the occupied areas, the population is constantly migrating, and the actual number of elementary school students is inevitably subject to sudden increases and decreases. The standard for student numbers should be slightly lowered to avoid the risk of school closure due to sudden decreases. Is this necessary? Please decide. Resolution: Each county shall submit its own report to the Department for approval. (24) What appropriate measures should be taken by schools in cities and towns during times of war emergency? (25) During times of war tension, if the education bureau cannot operate in towns and villages, it should immediately move to a safe location and send personnel to take charge in different areas in order to facilitate communication and increase efficiency. (26) This county has a vast territory and a special situation. If it is necessary to move the government office to a village to conduct administration, it will be inconvenient. Can branch offices be added to remedy this? Resolution: The above three proposals are combined for discussion. Handle according to the provisions of the notes on matters that county magistrates and education bureau chiefs should address during wartime, as passed in the tenth proposal. (27) A draft outline for local education supervision is being drafted. Please discuss. (28) How should the central work of supervision by supervisors and education committee members be determined? (29) How should local education supervision be implemented during wartime? Resolution: The above three proposals are combined for discussion. Passed according to the original outline of the twenty-seventh proposal. (30) The supervision forms issued by the Department are very complete, but since their implementation, there have been many obstacles. Can they be appropriately changed to meet wartime needs? Please discuss. (31) The twenty-five types of forms previously issued to county supervisors are numerous and inconvenient to use. It is proposed to revise and create new forms. (32) The supervision forms issued by the Department in the sixth year are numerous. In this extraordinary period, it seems difficult to use them. How should they be changed? (33) It is proposed to revise the supervision forms for supervisors and education committee members to adapt to wartime needs. (34) It is proposed to revise the supervision forms for supervisors and education committee members to adapt to the supervision work in occupied counties. (35) Please revise the supervision forms for supervisors and education committee members for wartime use. Resolution: The above six proposals are combined for discussion. Please instruct the Department to issue simplified supervision report forms for supervisors and education committee members for use by various counties. (36) How should supervisors, education committee members, and inspectors submit reports on a regular basis to facilitate timely review and instruction to increase effectiveness? Resolution: Handle according to the regulations for supervisors and education committee members. (37) The elementary school counseling system should be restored and improved. It is proposed that the Department add provincial counselors, and that provincial elementary schools add directors (or counselors) of counseling departments. Education committee members in each county and principals of complete elementary schools should earnestly counsel local primary elementary schools to improve education. Resolution: Forwarded to the Department for reference.</p>

<h3>Finance: Balancing Adding Positions and Closing Positions, Gold Market Falls Only Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot price of gold and black market situation did not change much, and the fluctuations were not large. However, the operators with relatively abundant strength were still adding positions as they saw fit, so although retail investors continued to emerge, there was no significant impact. The future is extremely difficult to grasp. In the current environment, it is feared that it may not be prosperous within this week. The market opened in the morning with a sluggish appearance, and was affected by the continued easing of foreign exchange and the cash number for sale, and fell to a low opening price of 3,645 yuan. Fortunately, soon Qian Duye and others competed to buy cheap goods, and the sluggishness was slightly recovered, hovering between 3,650 and 3,660 yuan. Around 10:30, foreign exchange suddenly reported that it was tightening again, and people's hearts were slightly shaken. Jinhao frequently added positions for speculators, and Li Angda reached 3,668 yuan. However, before the close, the selling wind came again due to the shift from soft to flat in the foreign exchange market, and it still fell back to 3,650 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was calm because there was no market on Wednesday for foreign exchange. Only the securities help bought some, and the price increased slightly. The closing price was already reported at 3,660 yuan, only a small one yuan higher than the previous day. The transaction throughout the day was slightly light, about a thousand taels. Silver jewelry shops remained unchanged all day, and customs gold was still flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Fell Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since the exhibition, each piece (ten taels) of gold initially opened because the foreign exchange market was slightly hardened, and the cash number was eager to sell. The opening price was actually reduced by 17 yuan. The cash number was sold to Yinhangbang for ten taels, for 3,645 yuan. After the opening, a certain Qian Duye came to buy cheap, and the seller took the opportunity to raise the price, and it immediately rebounded by 15 yuan. Qian Duye entered Zhengquanbang for 30 taels for 3,660 yuan. Later, Jinhao released more than 100 taels on behalf of customers, and the price was reduced by 10 yuan again. Jinhao sold 40 taels to Zhengquanbang for 3,650 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange suddenly reported that it was softening again, and people's hearts were shaken. A certain Jinhao bought it for speculators, and the Hong Kong gang also came to move around a little, so it rebounded by 18 yuan. Yinhangbang entered Jinhao for 20 taels, for 3,668 yuan. Then, the selling wind from retail investors started again, and the foreign exchange market had changed from tight to flat, and the entrants were sparse, so it fell by 18 yuan again. Qian Duye mutually did 10 taels, for 3,650 yuan. At noon, it rebounded again, Qian Duye entered Jinhao for 20 taels, for 3,654 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the situation became more and more quiet. The opening price increased by one yuan. Zhengquanbang entered Jinhao for 10 taels, for 3,655 yuan. Later, Zhengquanbang continued to absorb dozens of taels, and raised the price by five yuan again. Zhengquanbang entered Qian Duye for 20 taels, for 3,660 yuan. After entering, it fell back by two yuan. Qian Duye mutually did 10 taels, for 3,658 yuan. Later, Yinhangbang entered Jinhao for 20 taels, for 3,660 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was small two yuan, and it has fallen for four consecutive days, a total of seventy yuan. The whole day was up and down by twenty-three yuan. The selling price of the licensed gold for cash was about 10 yuan higher than the spot gold. The purchase was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current price of gold is 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Remains at the Original Price</p>
<p>The silver jewelry for each tael of jewelry was exchanged because the spot price rarely changed, so it did not change all day. Datonghang still maintained the original price of 370 yuan. The new Tonghang was the same as the upper price, and the purchase was still reduced by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Transactions Not Prosperous, Foreign Exchange Market Completely Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC listing, there were no ups and downs. The dark market of British and American exchange rates showed a slight easing trend in the calm, but the result was not glorious or disgraced compared with yesterday's closing. At the beginning of the morning, the British and American exchange rates were slightly reduced, resulting in the opening of the market in a re-reporting of the old state of British flat and American tight. Later, because the Japanese line Zhengjin and the American line came to vomit and plug, and speculators continued to sell, although HSBC was willing to absorb when it was cheap, the head had already felt sufficient. British gold once grew to five ban shier wu, and the American exchange rate also hardened to eight yuan liuer wu. Then, importers needed to settle foreign exchange, and speculators also profited from short covering, so the market once softened, to five ban shier ling san yier wu and eight yuan ban. Extending to noon, buyers and sellers hesitated, and the transaction turned light, and it was reported to close in a stable state, British gold five ban shier yiba qi wu, American exchange rate eight yuan wu liuer wu, which was equivalent to the previous day. The futures trend was also the same as the spot. The transaction in half a day was flat.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Sell, Foreign Firms Enter</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big article, the near term shrunk by one ba qi wu, the far term fell by er wu, the New York silver price was still flat, and the London raw gold was stable. The exchange rate of British to American and to French was flat, and to Shanghai was big ling liu er wu. American to British small yier wu, to Shanghai long er jiao, to French rise yier wu. The central listing of each exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price, British gold five ban shier yiba qi wu, American exchange rate eight yuan wu san yier wu, compared with the previous receipt, British flat American tight ling san yier wu, is the reason for the shrinking exchange rate. After the opening, the Japanese line came to block the sale, and American line and speculators also had a selling appetite, but HSBC sucked in when it was cheap, so the loosening trend was alleviated. It is estimated that Zhengjin vomited to HSBC spot British gold five ban shier wu, followed by speculators selling to Datong and other foreign lines spot American exchange rate eight yuan liuer wu, and at the same time a certain line also sold spot American exchange rate eight yuan wu liuer wu to counterparts. HSBC's listing revealed that it would not move, and the balance tax on silver was revealed to be small one cent er wu. After this, the foreign bank circle came to dig a little, and speculators and others covered short positions, so the situation once turned soft, and the foreign banks settled the spot American should be eight yuan wu liuer wu and half a yuan, and then the speculators covered the profitable December American exchange rate of eight yuan san qi wu, at the time British gold also followed the soft to five ban shier ling san yier wu, since the sale of the buyers waited and watched, the transaction suddenly thinned, so the state was also seen to be flat, extending to the noon receipt, the bank's spot selling price, British gold five ban shier yiba qi wu, American exchange rate eight yuan wu liuer wu, December British gold five ban shi er wu, American exchange rate eight yuan san qi wu, as a result, the current period of British and American exchange rates were not glorious or disgraced compared with the previous day, and there was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th, This morning's exchange market opened flat, and the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates did not move. The spot price of the Shanghai exchange rate rose slightly by one yuan, to 284 yuan. At 11:30, there was no glory or disgrace. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Exchange Rate Slightly Loosened</p>
<p>Tianjin, 15th, This morning's exchange market opened sluggish, the British exchange rate did not move, and was still five ban ling liu er wu. The spot price of the American exchange rate loosened by ling liu er wu, to eight yuan er jiao ban. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by qi jiao wu fen, to one hundred and three yuan er jiao ban. The "Joint Notes" black market also rose by qi jiao ban, to ninety-two yuan wu jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the British and American gold pounds saw limited supply and demand, and the market remained stagnant. Due to the weakness of the pound exchange rate, British gold notes slightly decreased. There was relatively strong demand for American gold notes, and the market price fluctuated with a firm undertone, initially at 11.62 yuan, and later in the evening at 11.625 yuan. The price movement was narrow. Hong Kong notes and Singapore notes were weak, and the market price slightly decreased. There was increased demand for French francs and Dutch guilders, and the market was slightly firm. Demand for Japanese gold notes was not strong, with the evening price at 1.29 yuan. Korean notes saw stagnant supply and demand, with the evening price at 1.155 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, American gold notes increase by 0.03 yuan, Hong Kong notes decrease by 0.01 yuan, French francs increase by 0.005 yuan, Singapore notes decrease by 0.10 yuan, Dutch guilders increase by 0.10 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Converting Sycee Gold to Standard Gold</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Yongyu:</p>
<p>Since the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th, spot transactions of standard gold have completely ceased in the Shanghai market. Therefore, most of the standard gold on the market has been acquired and melted into sycee gold, as sycee gold is the only form in which gold bars are currently bought and sold. Therefore, selling standard gold to cash shops or jewelers requires deducting a certain amount for fire labor, but the amount is not large and there are no formal regulations. However, the fineness of standard gold is lower than that of sycee gold. Standard gold is only 9.78 fine, while sycee gold is 9.93 fine, a difference of 0.15. If you want to calculate the price of one "ping" (70 taels) of standard gold, simply multiply one "ping" (70 taels) of standard gold by the market price of sycee gold, and then multiply by the difference in fineness between standard gold and sycee gold. Subtract this amount from the market price of one "ping" of sycee gold to get the result. The formula is as follows:</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills decreased from 37 yuan per 1,000 yuan in the morning to 36 yuan, then hovered between 36 and 37 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately closing at 37 yuan, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 0.15 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, it is said.</p>
<h3>American Silver Still Weak, British and Indian Silver Declining</h3>
<p>London, 14th: The silver market saw widespread selling and lacked support, with limited trading. The market was weak, and remained weak after closing. India showed some interest at the listed price. Bar silver saw a recent decline of 0.1875, and a forward decline of 0.25. New York silver report: American spot prices remained stable. Also, Bombay silver report: The Indian silver market was weak and sluggish. Spot and December futures both fell 17 annas, and January futures fell slightly by 15 annas.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Listless, Foreign Stocks Recover</h3>
<p>In the gray market for securities, yesterday's market, after a rebound the day before, lacked the ability to continue rising. The rumors of borrowing remained unfounded nonsense. A slight increase in market sentiment was exploited by long-term speculators to sell off their holdings. To suppress, one must raise, this is indeed a tactic of long-term speculation. However, it is a pity that those who blindly follow do not think and drift with the tide. Rumors from Nanjing grew louder and louder. Yesterday, the market price was initially firm in the morning, then weakened, and finally stabilized slightly. The bulls were still struggling. The shrewd bulls were slowly unloading their holdings. In the afternoon, they initially tried to rally the market again to confuse the public, but more and more people sold off their holdings, and the market price slowly declined. However, some retail investors were still buying on the dip. Tiensheng, Dafeng, Jiufeng, and others continued to sell. As a result, Category B bonds broke 9 yuan, and Category E bonds broke 8 yuan. The slight rise the day before was completely fleeting, down 0.01 to 0.05 yuan compared to the day before. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 20 shares of Ning Shao Steamship Company were traded at a price of 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The public exchange market was quiet and trending firm. Steel stocks stood out, opening at only 12.20 yuan and gradually rising to 13.20 yuan for buying and 13.30 yuan for selling at closing. The transaction volume was considerable. Rubber stocks remained slightly soft.</p>
<p>London, 14th: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, with no gains or losses for bonds of all grades.</p>
<p>London, 14th: Today's listed prices for British Far East company stocks reversed course and declined. Most stocks saw declines. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell 1 pound to 10 pounds even. Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall 5 shillings to 8 pounds even. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (London Registered) shares fell 1 pound to 84 pounds. Kulak-Lim Rubber shares fell 2 pence to 18 shillings 1 pence.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Strong Demand for Coarse Yarn, Prices Without Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm, but with narrow fluctuations and light trading, so the situation was not strong. As for current yarn sales, fine yarn was not widespread, but 10-count coarse yarn was still being generously taken by buyers from various southern provinces, who were constantly seeking it. However, in order to reduce inventory and promote sales, factories were willing to sell, so the market price could not rise, but it was higher than the price of 20-count yarn. Currently, the general opinion among operators is that there is no hope for a decline in raw cotton prices, and factory costs are increasing, so the foundation of the yarn market may be further consolidated.</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market this morning saw no major changes, with the opening price at 647 yuan. The foreign exchange rate was then quoted as unchanged, and market sentiment was even. After a while, it was heard that demand for coarse yarn from Guangdong buyers was still strong, and traders resumed buying, and the price rose back to 648 yuan. However, the market situation was still scattered and weak. A total of 1,355 bales were traded in the first half of the day, and the market was generally similar to the previous day. Chongxin Factory opened with 250 bales of 20-count Dafu yarn at a price of 612 yuan for immediate payment, and 100 bales of 10-count Dafu yarn at a price of 520 yuan. Today, 144 pieces of yarn were exported to Hong Kong, and 15 pieces to Guangzhou Bay. The amount purchased by each buyer group is listed below:</p>
<p>Traders: 785; Fuzhou: 125</p>
<p>Yunnan: 25; Hong Kong: 350</p>
<p>Inland: 70; Total: 1,355</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Hoard, Waiting to Sell at a Good Price</h3>
<p>Cotton trading was slightly quiet, because the yarn market was weak, and factory appetite was not strong. Japanese factories sought to take action, but Yong'an Factory recently opened up a lot in coarse yarn, supplementing Pingguo'er raw materials to offset costs, only slightly embellishing it. However, traders were thinking intensely, and have already packaged and stored dried and clean cotton in warehouses, waiting to sell at a good price, showing a strong bullish sentiment. From Northern Jiangsu, there were 3,725 bales of Tong cotton, 488 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 674 pieces of Beisha cotton. Today, 357 pieces of cotton were exported to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces to Haikou. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Haiti Point: 127.00; Trader purchased: 200 bales</p>
<p>Changyinsha: 129.50; Trader purchased: 400 bales</p>
<p>Tong Cotton: 135.00, 135.40; Trader purchased: 362 bales</p>
<p>American Fine Cotton: 129.50; Trader purchased: 200 bales</p>
<p>Tong Cotton: 135.25; Trader purchased: 300 bales</p>
<p>Pingguo'er: 28.00; Yong'an purchased: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Another report: The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has recently become dull again. Yarn sales have not improved, so factories are quiet, and traders are also taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, Japanese manufacturers still have sporadic transactions in American cotton, but the number is very small, and they are all for immediate shipment. However, the general opinion is that American cotton trading may have a prosperous day.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market has been very active recently. It showed a firm trend from the beginning yesterday morning. The number of cloth sales is improving daily, and Yan Jinfu has a large number of openings, so factory demand is very healthy, triggering a large number of spot transactions. Traders were therefore intensely purchasing in the market, so there was a soaring wind, and it triggered a large number of short covering. Yesterday's closing price rose another 3 to 4 points compared to the previous day. However, yesterday's Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than 4 rupees. The Egyptian market has been closed for two days, and Liverpool fell by 7 pence.</p>
<h3>Grain: Customer Xiang Rice Hoarding, Some Selling Yesterday</h3>
<p>The rice market has been soaring all week, and all prices seem to have reached their peak. After the market softened once the day before yesterday, yesterday's opening was still normal. However, hoarders, seeing that actual sales were becoming cold, privately calculated that there seemed to be little hope of profit, and almost all stopped. In addition, the appetite of local countryside shops was increasingly sluggish, which reversed the previous sensation and showed weakness. However, the vendors from other places still held on to their strategies due to their own interests, and were unwilling to relax their sales. With both sides holding on, the mid-market phenomenon formed a fixed color. However, at this time, the market is constantly changing drastically, and regardless of buyers or sellers, they are wary of any market downturn. Seeing this situation, hoarders suddenly sold, and many people followed suit. A large number of people sold, and the market was full of goods. Local customers all stood by and watched, the sales ground became more sluggish, and the market was difficult to support, resulting in a downstream result. If the new japonica rice arrives, it is uniquely prosperous, with 23-24 trucks of Su, Kun, Qing, Si, Feng, and Lian goods. The market is half a yuan cheaper than the previous market price. Other goods also depreciated by different amounts of 0.2-0.3 yuan. The initial opening price of Jiangbei sharp rice was 28 yuan, and the closing price was 27.8 yuan, then down to 27.3-27.4 yuan. The initial opening price of Jingwu sharp rice was 28.1-28.2 yuan, then only 18.28 yuan and 27.8 yuan and a half, then down to 26.5 yuan for broken rice. The total number of transactions in the unified market was only over 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>In the morning, customer Xiang rice merchants continued to inquire with shops and countryside operators, and the sellers raised the price again, and the market price once rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan. However, the appetite of shops was very weak, and they stopped after buying a little. Also, the countryside was watching with expensive prices, and hoarders' manipulation gradually lacked a basis. Then it was heard that a certain firm had 20,000 bags of Anhui Xiang rice that had just arrived yesterday, which was being unloaded into warehouses, and floating profits were immediately sold, so the market gradually fell. The total market transaction was also less than 2,000 bags. However, the high price of Wuhu Xiang rice has been opened up to 28.2 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>No Whole-Batch Outlet for Flour</h3>
<p>The current flour market is quite mediocre, because the sales ground is lifeless. There are only sporadic embellishments from both the North and South factions, and there is no large outlet. Even retail transactions on this street are affected by the cheap dumping of miscellaneous flour from the inland, and the appetite is sluggish. Only a small number of retail investors from the Qingdao faction in the unified market, and the Hong Kong faction, due to available ship positions, have slightly configured it. The transaction volume is less than 30,000 bags. The second flour factory continued to open at 7.1 yuan, and the selling price of warehouse receipt flour was different by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The situation is generally similar to the previous one.</p>
<p>The wheat market continued to be deadlocked, and the appetite of various factories was consistently sluggish. Hoarders are even more on the sidelines and do not take action. As a result, only three trucks of Suzhou wheat were traded in the market, at a price of 11.15 yuan, which is 0.2-0.3 yuan lower than before, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Again</h3>
<p>Kobe Barrel Oil: 75 Yuan; Raw Oil Shipped to Hong Kong in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The soybean oil market, under the potential of no surge in sources, has created a monopoly for speculators, resulting in repeated and sharp price increases. Kobe barrel oil has reached a rare high price of 75 yuan. Although bulk oil is relatively looser, the overall situation is still moving forward, and the market is rising frequently. Yesterday, barrel oil rose by 1.5 yuan, and bulk oil rose by 1.2-1.3 yuan. Ten barrels of Kobe oil were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. Twenty barrels of Dalian oil, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil, 30 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil, and 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded. Also, 100 barrels will be delivered in 2-3 weeks. Peanut oil saw a small movement from Hong Kong buyers, with 100 pieces from this street going to Jiaozhou, and 150 barrels of Qingdao oil. The market is 1-5 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, calculated by the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai, and for the sake of accumulation, and at the time of the emergence of new raw oil, raw oil shipped to Hong Kong is quite incessant. Yesterday, another 160 pieces and 4,140 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong. There were also 123 bags of raw kernels and 967 bags of beans exported to Hong Kong today. 1817 bags of beans were shipped to Haikou, and only 220 bags of beans arrived in Shanghai, coming from Beisha.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Loose and Tight Camel Down are Selling Well in Time</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were more retail transactions than wholesale in the woolen cloth market, and the price of goods remained firm. However, the seller secretly seemed willing to increase the commission transferred by the brokers. Loose and tight camel down are now in season, so sales are very prosperous. All woolen cloth businesses are thriving. The wholesale price of first-grade Mao Bei camel down is 5.75 yuan per yard. Tiansheng Invincible brand Art Velvet is 5.5 yuan per yard. Weilin Tiger Pattern is 5.25 yuan. Weiyi Double Deer Pattern is 2.75 yuan. Art Velvet is 3.6 yuan. Tianhe Wufu brand is 2.05 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands and second-grade goods are generally sold for 1.8-1.9 yuan. Foreign goods and silk shops are more prosperous than woolen cloth shops.</p>
<p>Today, 184 pieces of piece goods were exported to ??? Port, 97 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 28 pieces to Haiphong, and 244 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Metals: Deformed Steel Bars Slightly Inferior</h3>
<p>Deformed steel bars were very strong a few days ago. Construction firms on this street and buyers from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao all purchased a lot. However, since recently, people's minds have changed, and standards have softened. Compared to the past, they are slightly inferior by 40-50 yuan. The current market price is 750 yuan per ton for 3-4 points, and 710 yuan per ton for 5 points to 1 inch. A few days ago, construction firms purchased more than 20 tons, Qingdao firms announced the purchase of 30 tons (but did not ship it). Tianjin and Yantai also shipped more than 10 tons. About 20 tons were shipped to Ningbo, and more than 10 tons to Fujian, it is said.</p>
<h3>Statistics: Price Changes</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>—September—(1)</p>
<p>The rising price trend of September continued unabated. The main reason was the impact of the war in Europe. Because merchants generally feared that foreign goods sources would be blocked, and they could only rely on the existing goods on the market, which could not supply long-term sales in the future, the psychology of hoarding prevailed in Shanghai. Even non-industry hoarders hoped for the wealth dreams of the last European war, and wildly raised prices to collect and hoard. Under the dual pressure, how could prices not be expensive? Therefore, the sound of price increases was heard every day, and the social impact was undoubtedly accelerating the reduction of purchasing power. Here, only the price increase notices published in newspapers in September are counted. The prices of raw materials originally differed in the morning and evening, and each newspaper's commercial conditions column had listings for reference. This is omitted here. A total of 137 price increases occurred in September, a decrease of 29 from August. The 137 types of goods with price increases can be divided into 16 categories: food and beverage, clothing, daily necessities, metal and electrical, printing and publishing, medicine, cultural supplies, packaging, transportation, cosmetics, fuel, construction, decoration, raw materials, cleaning and hygiene, and candles. Among them, food and beverage items ranked first with 26 price increase units, metal and electrical items ranked second with 21, daily necessities ranked third with 19, transportation items ranked fourth with 17, medicine items ranked fifth with 16, cultural supplies ranked sixth with 13, clothing and cosmetics ranked seventh with 12 each, printing and publishing ranked eighth with 8, construction items ranked ninth with 6, packaging, fuel, and raw materials ranked tenth with 3 each, decoration items ranked eleventh with 2, and cleaning and hygiene and candles ranked last with 1 each.

<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle Drives on Kaifeng Road; British Troops Intercept</h3>
<p>Japanese Negotiations Fail; Return by Original Route</p>
<p>At about 1:00 PM yesterday, a small team of Japanese Navy personnel, about a dozen people, drove a yellow military truck westward along North Suzhou Road from the Waibaidu Bridge. When passing North Xizang Road, when they were about to turn into Kaifeng Road, they were intercepted by British troops stationed there and forbidden to move forward. Although the Japanese troops tried their best to negotiate, the British troops insisted on not allowing them to pass. After a standoff of about 20 minutes, the Japanese troops had to return by the original route.</p>
<h3>Shanghai American Military Commander Replaced by Baker; Assumes Office in China in February Next Year; Former Commander Fegan Has Received Orders</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 14th: According to the US Navy Department, Colonel Baker has been appointed as the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy in Shanghai and will assume office in China in February next year. The current commander of the American forces in Shanghai is Colonel Fegan. Colonel Baker was born in 1894 and is originally from California. He graduated from the US Naval Academy and served as a major officer in the US Marine Corps in 1915.</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 14th), it was heard from reliable sources that Colonel Fegan, the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai, has received orders to return to Washington. The Fourth Marine Regiment Command has not yet issued a statement, but it is said that Colonel Fegan will return to the United States by the beginning of next year, and his successor has also been appointed as Colonel Baker. Colonel Baker is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of January or the beginning of February, but the exact date has not yet been determined. Colonel Fegan came to China from Washington about a year ago and succeeded Colonel Plath as the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Founding of the Marine Corps: US Military Holds Grand Parade; Antique Uniform Performance Most Spectacular; Military Leaders from Various Nations Attend to Observe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse was filled with guests. More than two thousand Americans and their friends from various countries were invited to witness the celebration of the 164th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps, hosted by the Fourth Regiment of Marines stationed in Shanghai. The original anniversary of the US Marine Corps is November 10th, but due to continuous rain last week and accumulated water on the field, the ceremony was postponed to yesterday.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect.</p>
<p>The event proceeded extremely successfully. Yesterday's US military parade was perhaps the most spectacular of the twelve years since the Fourth Regiment of Marines arrived in Shanghai. The ceremony included performances and modern military drills. The highlight of the performances was the appearance of four Marines dressed in the green and maroon uniforms of the US Marine Corps from 164 years ago, before the audience. Then, in quick</p>
<p>costume changes,</p>
<p>the equipment was altered, displaying the changes in uniforms, vehicles, and military equipment throughout the generations, presenting a living history to the audience. This performance was the idea of Colonel Fegan, the commander of the Fourth Regiment of Marines. Colonel Fegan had been designing this historical performance for many years, having been</p>
<p>engaged in research</p>
<p>before coming to China. He originally planned to hold it at the US Marine Barracks in Washington, but unexpectedly received orders to come to Shanghai to command the Fourth Regiment of Marines, and this grand performance was moved to Shanghai. The antique uniforms worn by the performing soldiers were designed by Colonel Fegan himself and tailored in Shanghai. The performance team also carried the original flag of the thirteen colonies</p>
<p>the earliest banners</p>
<p>and the ancient flag with the "Don't Tread on Me" rattlesnake graphic, which were also made in Shanghai. When Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Colonel Fegan of the Shanghai Marines Fourth Regiment, and staff officers of the Asiatic Fleet stepped onto the reviewing stand, they received a solemn and enthusiastic salute from the soldiers. After the inspection, a banquet was held at the Marines Club on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Those at the banquet</p>
<p>included Major Morandi, Commander of the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai; Major Banti Volio, Law Enforcement Officer of the Italian Marine Corps; Colonel Hongbei, Commander of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps; Faber, Commissioner of the French Police, and his wife; Major General Kanto Yoshinobu, Commander of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai; Kurihara, Senior Staff Officer of the Japanese Marine Corps; Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol; Admiral</p>
<p>Hepburn,</p>
<p>Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and his family; Mr. Gao Qi, US Consul General; Major General Tibet, Commander of the British Defense Force stationed in Shanghai; Lieutenant Colonel Maulai, Commander of the West Forze Highland Team; Lieutenant Colonel Sivanton, Commander of the East Auxiliary Team; and Colonel Glini, Commander of the French Defense Force stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Future of Portuguese Shipping is Uncertain; Portuguese Consulate Claims All Ships Released Unconditionally; But Portuguese Shipping Companies Fail to Confirm This</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, the status of the eleven Portuguese ships officially announced to have been released by the Japanese naval authorities last week remains unresolved. Although the Portuguese Consulate claims that all ships were released unconditionally, inquiries to the five Portuguese shipping companies to which the detained ships belong failed to confirm this. According to an official from the Portuguese Atlantic Company yesterday (the 14th), the company's "Hailong"</p>
<p>has been released,</p>
<p>but on the condition that the ship be inspected by the "Dadao" government's "Navigation Bureau." The fees charged for this special inspection by the Japanese-backed regime are likely to be quite high, but the ship itself will not be registered with the puppet regime and will continue to sail under the Portuguese flag. Furthermore, an official from another Portuguese company, Mouchang, claimed that they had received notification of the release of their company's ships, but were currently waiting for the Japanese to propose conditions so that their company's ships could resume sailing. According to reliable sources,</p>
<p>the merger of five small</p>
<p>companies to form a large Portuguese shipping company is currently underway. However, due to the large number of ship owners involved, the organization of the company is proceeding slowly. The Portuguese Consul General denied rumors that the Portuguese authorities in Shanghai would no longer allow any ships to be registered, claiming that the rumors were completely unfounded. It was also reported that five Portuguese shipping companies were discussing a merger to form a large company, which is currently underway. According to reporters from Dagong News Agency, inquiries to the Portuguese American Steamship Company, Zhengde Steamship Company, and Huamei Shipping Company, which represents Portuguese ships,</p>
<p>were unanimously denied.</p>
<p>There is no merger of new companies or business dealings, and it is practically impossible. However, it is known that someone is indeed organizing a new company to restore the operation of the released ships.</p>
<h3>Movements of British Troops Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One Company of the East Surrey Regiment May Be Transferred to Tianjin to Replace Another</p>
<p>Since the British government decided to withdraw troops stationed in North China, yesterday, according to a United Press dispatch from Tianjin, one company of the East Surrey Regiment of the British Defense Force in Shanghai will be sent to Tianjin to replace the British Defense Force Light Infantry Regiment of the Fulham Regiment to protect the interests of British expatriates. When reporters inquired with the British Defense Force Command here, they said it was too early to confirm, but the content of the news was not wrong. There are also rumors that the entire West Force Highland Team of the British Defense Force in Shanghai will be withdrawn soon, but this could not be confirmed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Authorities Strictly Prohibit Sailors from Hiding Strong Young Men</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, in order to strengthen the war effort and maximize the replenishment of manpower, the military authorities in Zhejiang Province previously issued an order to all counties strictly prohibiting strong young men from coming to Shanghai. However, since the resumption of the Shanghai-Ningbo route, many sailors have been tempted by large profits and often hide strong young men to smuggle them out. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, in view of the fact that selected strong young men must not move without a permit issued by the county, and that those who move without a permit will be treated as draft dodgers, and that there are clear provisions for the recruitment of national service and the implementation of lottery in Zhejiang Province during the emergency period, it is therefore considered that smuggling strong young men to Shanghai, even if there is no traitorous behavior, is also helping draft dodging, and should be dealt with in accordance with the Criminal Law and the Regulations for Punishing Crimes against the Military Service Law. A special telegram was sent to the Provincial Military Control Command to instruct all counties to comply. After receiving the order, the Yinxian County Government immediately forwarded it to all district offices and the Yinxian Shipping Association for notification.</p>

<h3>Fudan and Aurora Universities Mourn Ma Xiangbo Yesterday Morning; The Two Assemblies Were Solemn and Respectful, with the Utmost Honors; Permanent Commemoration Measures are Being Planned; A Centenary Shrine is Being Built in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ma Xiangbo Memorial Society has been discussing commemoration measures for several days. In addition to (1) holding a memorial service, (2) publishing posthumous works, (3) raising funds to support the family, and (4) building a Xiangbo Library at Fudan University, concrete steps have been formulated. Now, at the suggestion of Yu Youren, a "Centenary Shrine" will be built in Chongqing to show eternal commemoration of this virtuous and respected elder. It is reported that Wu Zexiang, Secretary-General of Chongqing Municipality, representing He Guoguang, has agreed to use the old site of Fuzichi as the construction site for the Centenary Shrine. It is also heard that funds will be raised separately for the project. Changing Fuzichi to the Centenary Shrine is of great significance. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>After Mr. Ma Xiangbo passed away in Liangshan, Aurora and Fudan Universities, which he founded, held memorial services and Requiem Masses at the Saint Peter's Church on Rue Lupan and the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Association respectively, yesterday morning. In addition to the entire staff and students of both schools, people from all walks of life attended the ceremonies, which were extremely crowded and honored. Details of each event are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan Memorial Service</p>
<p>Over a Thousand People Attended, with the Utmost Honors</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Fudan University held the "Memorial Service for Master Ma Xiangbo" on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. More than a thousand people attended, including members of the Board of Trustees of the university, university, affiliated high school, experimental middle school, alumni association, faculty, students, and guests from all walks of life, including Wen Lanting, etc., with the utmost honors. Each guest was given a badge with the "Portrait of the Master from Dantu," which was pinned to their chest as a memorial. The venue was decorated with white cloth banners in front of the Pudong Building. The surroundings of the venue were hung with elegiac couplets presented by the faculty, students of Fudan, and guests from all walks of life. The altar was also decorated with white cloth banners, decorated with pine, cypress, and flowers. The national flag, the Fudan school flag, and the portrait of Mr. Ma Xiangbo were hung in front. Although the arrangement was very simple, it was solemn and respectful, and admirable.</p>
<p>Separate Tributes, Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>The memorial service began at 10:00 AM, and the ceremony was solemn. First, Chairman Xia Jingguan paid tribute, and the entire assembly paid the most respectful bow three times to the portrait of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. Then, Guo Zhongliang, representative of the Fudan Board of Trustees, Jin Tongyin of the University Department, Yin Yiwen of the Affiliated High School, Zhu Zushun of the Experimental Middle School, and Xu Xiaochu of the Alumni Association, offered flowers separately. Chen Zhongda respectfully read the memorial text, and Mao Xibi Yidu read the biography of Ma Xiang.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with Grief, Compilation of Speeches</p>
<p>Afterwards, the chairman delivered a speech, saying that Mr. Ma was very enthusiastic and accomplished in running education during his lifetime. Now that the teacher is dead, his spirit will last forever. He hoped that future generations would follow the teacher's legacy and work hard. Then Huang Bingfu gave a speech, saying that not long ago, a grand centenary celebration was held for Mr. Ma, and it was hoped that Mr. Ma would reach one hundred and ten or one hundred and twenty, but today, months later, this memorial service is being held, and all walks of life are extremely sad. But who can avoid death in life, only death is heavier than Mount Tai, lighter than a feather. During his lifetime, the teacher was loyal to the country and concerned about the country. Some months ago, he received a letter from the teacher saying, "Why linger in a foreign land when old age beckons?" It can be seen that the teacher's death was by no means painless, but was a heart disease, sacrificing himself for the country. Although the teacher's body has passed away, his spirit will last forever. The widespread irrigation of the teacher's spirit is the new life of the Republic of China. Later, Zhang Chongren, the representative of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's family, gave a reply, reporting the course of the teacher's illness (see previous report), saying that when I got married not long ago, my father-in-law still earnestly instructed that the country was in trouble, and that everything should be frugal except for the necessary ceremonies, and thanked everyone on behalf of the Ma family. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Aurora Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>Aurora University in this city was also founded by Teacher Ma. All teachers and students cherish the spring breeze and specially joined Catholic friends to hold a Requiem Mass at Saint Peter's Church on Rue Lupan at 7:30 AM yesterday morning to express their condolences. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Catholic Friends, Requiem Mass</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM, in the faint morning light, Aurora students and Catholic friends in black crowns and white clothes flocked to Rue Lupan, rushing to Saint Peter's Church. President Chaylard of Aurora University stood in front of the stone steps of the church, greeting guests. Ma Xiang's nephews Zhu Zhiyao and Zhu Jilin, his great-grandson Zhang Chongren and his wife, and those who had known the Ma family in their lifetime, also entered the church to participate in this grand Requiem Mass. According to statistics, no less than a thousand people participated.</p>
<p>Solemn Arrangement, Solemn Air</p>
<p>The church was arranged in a very solemn manner. The altar was surrounded by wooden fences, with a memorial platform in the middle, covered with soft silk, similar to a coffin, to represent Mr. Ma's remains. Upstairs at the entrance of the church, there was an orchestra and choir, playing elegies. The altar and the memorial platform were surrounded by white torches, and the shining light flickered in the solemn air.</p>
<p>Chanting Scriptures, Mournful Music Lingering</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM, the main priest, Father Yao Zhanchen, and the accompanying priests, Father Qiao Dianai and Father Fu, dressed in brilliant religious robes, stepped in front of the altar amidst the lingering sounds of mournful music, praying aloud and chanting scriptures, rising and falling, corresponding to the elegies and mournful music. After a while, eight boys holding sacred lamps were added, and led by the main priest Father Yao, they circled the memorial platform twice, sprinkling holy water everywhere to bless the remains. Finally, the Eucharist ceremony was held. This solemn and grand Requiem Mass was completed in order in one hour, and it dispersed at 8:30 AM.</p>
<p>Planning Permanent Commemoration</p>
<p>In order to permanently commemorate Mr. Ma, Aurora and Fudan Universities intend to launch the organization of a library and compile and print Mr. Ma's posthumous works, and coordinate commemoration measures for long-term remembrance. Aurora is actively preparing for it. The Fudan Alumni Association also received a telegram from Wu Nanxuan, Vice President of Fudan University in Beibei, claiming, "The Fudan Board of Trustees and Alumni Association in that place plan to raise funds to build a library for Mr. Ma in Beibei and compile and print his posthumous works for permanent commemoration."</p>
<p>Fudan's Memorial Text</p>
<p>On November 15th, the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Fudan University Board of Trustees, Fudan University, Fudan Affiliated Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, and Fudan Alumni Association, respectfully offer this clean wine and offerings to the spirit of former President Ma Xiangbo from Dantu, saying: Alas, Master rose in East Asia, renowned in the world. For five hundred years, he revived the decline, inspired the deaf and shook the blind, followed like the wind, and was respected by all. Master's achievements are recorded in the country. Cai Yang promoted labor, traveled at home and abroad, enjoyed after worry, and established national peace. Long-term planning, the interests of the country were gained. Master's way is like a dragon, kind and loving, kind and gentle, upright and unhidden, pure and devoted, and deeply understood by rituals, attracting attention from the court and the public. Master's heart is like the moon and the sun, with clean ambitions and integrity, embracing simplicity and guarding unity. He left the Southern State and rested in Liangshan, enduring hardships and remaining steadfast, and the Mingyi divination was auspicious. Master's learning is a deep study of heaven and man, gaining knowledge and investigating things, subtle and boundless, measuring power comprehensively, and having great and pure thoughts. Translating the Four Saints, reversing the three gods. Master's years were healthy and long-lived, with a jade face and square pupils, thick eyebrows and white hair. He communicated with An Qi in art and joined Shao Hao in years. Like a mountain and a ridge, he was a treasure to the country. Master's teachings were old and diligent, transmitting scriptures in Zhushui and lecturing in He Fen. Fang Du received his studies, and Liu Jia was able to write. Students gathered widely, and the green tent was famous. Heaven truly produced a sage, surpassing the ancients and the present, a blessing to the country and a ferry to the people. There is no way to stay the scene, how can it be suddenly ended? Family sacrifices must not be forgotten, and the determination to die will be lost. I mourn this old man, why not ask for a legacy? What was previously admired, now lost and no one to rely on. Not what A likes, public opinion is here. The world's grief, the private of the disciples. Mount Tai collapsed, and there is no way to climb. The affection of teachers and the depth of thoughts. I steal a stick of incense, what can I rely on? Keeping the heart in my clothes, building a hut for the grave. Mountains and rivers are separated, and it is difficult to express words. The wine and shame are respectfully offered, only sincerity and reverence. May the spirit come to enjoy and see the foolish heart, remembering the beginning and the end, tears pouring down. Alas, enjoy it!</p>
<p>Ma Xiang's Deeds</p>
<p>Mao Xibi, who wrote and read Mr. Xiang's deeds, said: The teacher's surname is Ma, his name is Xiangbo, and he is from Danyang, Jiangsu. His father, Duke Songyan, practiced medicine and was fond of giving. His mother, Madam Shen, was also happy to do good. The teacher was born on March 19th of the 20th year of the Qing Daoguang reign (72 years before the founding of the Republic of China), the year the British captured Zhoushan in the Opium War. He entered school at the age of five. In that year, his younger brother Meishu was born, so the teacher was five years older than Meishu. Combining the General's life and deeds, it can be divided into four periods, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The period of youth cultivation. After entering school, he read the classics of the church and the Four Books. He was extremely intelligent and able to recite everything he saw. At the age of eleven, he entered Xuhui Public School with his younger brother Meishu. After finishing the Four Books and Five Classics, he studied in the general course for ten years, and then in the specialized course for another ten years. He was fluent in religion, philosophy, Greek, Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.</p>
<p>(2) The period of preaching and politics. The teacher was fourteen years old when Hong Xiuquan entered Jinling. After twenty, he was ordered by the church to engage in relief work in the Su-Tai area, working diligently and tirelessly. At the age of thirty, he was ordained as a priest by the Roman Catholic Church. He then preached in Su-Wan and obtained the consent of Duke Songyan to distribute wealth to relieve the disaster and raise funds for the flood relief. These are all the teacher's inheritance of family education, and the promotion of Christ's love of God and love of neighbor, as well as for the suffering people. In terms of politics, he mainly handled foreign affairs and deliberated on politics. Handling foreign affairs was between the ages of twenty-six and fifty-six, a period of twenty years. He first entered Li Wenzhong's staff to help with foreign affairs, and was deeply appreciated. He planned to establish a national bank and was sent to the United States to borrow 50 million, but it was not successful due to the opposition of court officials. In order to consolidate diplomatic relations, he was sent to Korea, but the Grand Yuanjun could not use him. He went to France to inspect business affairs and was warmly welcomed. After the age of fifty, he served as the consul in Nagasaki and the counselor of the embassy. He served as the director of foreign affairs in Jiangsu in the first year of the Republic of China. During the period of deliberation on politics, it also lasted for ten years. In the second year before the founding of the Republic, the Jiangsu Provincial Advisory Bureau was established, and the teacher was elected as a provincial councilor. In the second year of the Republic, it was changed to the Provincial Assembly. In the third year of the Republic, Yuan's order was dissolved, and it was revived in the sixth year of the Republic. Since then, the teacher has been elected in every election, and has contributed greatly to the politics of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>(3) The period of running schools. The teacher was already sixty-four years old when he ran Aurora. He invested tens of thousands of dollars with the purpose of starting with language and seeking Western learning subjects. There are four main categories: (A) Linguistics, (B) Mathematics, (C) Physics, (D) Zhi Zhi Xue. The teacher himself taught Latin, Zhi Zhi Xue, and Mathematics. On Sundays, he gathered to give lectures. Other subjects were taught by church elders. The school administration was assisted by students, which opened up the pioneer of student autonomy. The teacher was already sixty-six years old when he established Fudan after Aurora disbanded. He asked Jiang Du Zhou Fu to allocate more than 70 mu of official land in Wu淞炮台 as the school site and allocated 20,000 yuan. He opened the school first at the Wu淞提督行轅 and obtained Jiang Du's approval to allocate 1,000 yuan per month as a regular expense. The foundation of Fudan Public School was laid. The teacher was the first president. The following year, he was sent to Japan to handle the aftermath of returning students. Within two years, the president was changed three times, Yan Youling, Xia Jiancheng, and Gao Mengdan. He returned to his post in the third year before the founding of the Republic. In the second year before the founding of the Republic, he concurrently served as the director of Jiaomu as a councilor of the Advisory Bureau. During the Xinhai Restoration, the Wu淞 school building was occupied and suspended for one year. In the first year of the Republic, the teacher ordered Yu Youren and Shao Lizi to ask the authorities to allocate the Li Gong Ancestral Hall in Xujiahui as the school building and obtained President Sun's allocation of 10,000 yuan to continue running the school. The old marshal resumed his post as president. There were two instances of leaving and returning. The teacher's concern for his alma mater can be seen from this.</p>
<p>(4) The period of late-year writings and Montreux. After the age of seventy-eight, the teacher lived in the Tushanwan Leshantang, writing by the pool and practicing painting again. Those who obtained it at that time regarded it as a treasure. In addition to his brother Meishu, the teacher completed the book Ma's Grammar after the age of fifty, which is the standard of Chinese grammar. After the age of sixty, he wrote Latin Grammar as a textbook for Aurora. After the age of eighty, he wrote Zhi Zhi Qian Shuo, and after the age of ninety, he wrote a sequel to Zhi Zhi Qian Shuo, and also translated the Four Saints' Gospels. After the 918 Incident, the teacher had many words of concern about the times and anger at the world. He entered Beijing in the winter of the 25th year and was selected as a member of the National Government by the Central Government the following year. In the autumn, the Shanghai War broke out and the National Government moved west. The teacher entered Guilin by carriage. Last autumn, the teacher, at the age of ninety-nine, moved to Liangshan. On November 4th of this year, he died without illness, seven and a half months after his centenary birthday. Looking at the teacher's life, he failed to fulfill his ambitions in politics. He assisted Wen Zhong in handling foreign affairs, but the national bank plan failed to materialize. He planned to establish diplomatic relations with China and Korea, but the Grand Yuanjun could not use him. In the fifth year of the Republic, Yuan's imperial system was self-imposed, and the teacher advised against it but did not listen. This is a clear sign. As for running schools, although he suffered setbacks, he persevered and finally succeeded. The length of the alma mater's history and the magnitude of its achievements are all the teacher's gifts. In recent ten years, although the teacher was old and infirm, he never forgot the alma mater he founded. In the autumn of the 19th year, Fudan held the 15th anniversary celebration and traveled far to Jiangwan. In the summer of the 23rd year, the affiliated high school held the 95th birthday celebration. In the spring of the 24th year, the Lixuetang of the affiliated high school was completed, and he came in a carriage to participate in the ceremony. The teacher was rich in emotion and liked to meet with young people. He would respond to requests for calligraphy and would write for several hours without tiring. His outlook on life can be said to be similar to Confucius' "forgetting food when angry, forgetting worries when happy, and not knowing that old age is coming." Recently, when he heard good news in his illness, he was unusually excited, got up to eat, and there was a faint voice of "news, news" in his dying moments. His concern for national affairs and Sun Yat-sen's dying words of "peaceful struggle to save China" have the same meaning. The good news that the teacher was looking forward to is still awaited, and the teacher's success in running education, knowing it spiritually, must be smiling in the white cloud township to today's memorial service, with a hall full of peaches and plums.</p>
<h3>Three Giant Norwegian Ships Scheduled to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Taishan and Sanmin Ships Sail South; Titanic Ship Sails to America</p>
<p>Several large, fast, new ships of Norwegian nationality, managed by the British Tianxiang Ocean Shipping Company in this port, with tonnage of more than 12,000 tons, are dedicated to sailing from Shanghai to Los Angeles in New York, USA, and from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other ports. The voyage is very fast, and it takes only 34 days to reach New York from Shanghai and 2 days to reach Hong Kong from Shanghai. The "Taishan" (M/Y "Taishan") will sail to Hong Kong and Singapore on the 17th of this month, and the "Titanic" (M/Y "Titania") will sail to the United States. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the European War, the number of ships here has suddenly decreased, so the cargo loads of export ships are very enthusiastic. The Norwegian merchant Sanmin Steamboat, represented by the Lian Shunhang of this port, runs the Shanghai-Hong Kong coastal route all year round. Due to its accurate and fast schedule, complete passenger facilities, and simple cargo handling procedures, warehouses are set up in various ports. Therefore, cargo owners and passengers are satisfied. It has repeatedly departed fully loaded with passengers and cargo. It is now known that the ship will arrive in Shanghai on the 16th, berth at the Jinliyuan pontoon, and will depart directly to Hong Kong Haifang for the fifth time on the 20th. It is also known that most of the passenger and cargo cabins have been pre-booked, especially for yarn and cloth. The ship has a tonnage of 3,500 tons, a speed of 11 nautical miles, and a passenger capacity of 700.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Transactions Active; Over 10 Million Yuan in Transactions Last Month; Sale of Tongfu Lane Real Estate Not Yet Completed; Owner Asking for Over 1.4 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Real estate transactions in this city have recently become more active. A news item recently reported that a large real estate transaction was concluded in the central district, stating that real estate transactions last month reached about 3.5 million yuan. In fact, the number of transactions last month was more than this, and should be over 10 million yuan. It was also stated that a certain lane on Jing'an Temple Road in the central district has also been sold, with a price of 1.22 million yuan. Reading the reported number of acres clearly refers to Tongfu Lane. Inquiries to lawyer Shen Zhaojiu, who is handling the owner's side of Tongfu Lane, revealed that the sale of the lane's real estate has not yet been completed, because the property is located in the central district and is an extremely good property. The owner's side is unwilling to sell it easily unless they receive a price of more than 1.4 million yuan. According to the previous valuation of real estate in this city by the Bureau, the standard is no longer suitable for current needs. It is heard that there will be a trend of raising and re-evaluating this year. If so, real estate in this city will inevitably become more expensive.</p>

<h3>Rice Shortage in Japan: Assistance from Korea and Taiwan is Likely to be Difficult; Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Regularly Discusses Storage and Stockpiling; Shanghai Rice Prices Will Not Be Affected in the Future</h3>
<p>Japan has experienced droughts and floods this year, leading to a poor rice harvest. It is importing rice from abroad, a phenomenon not seen in nearly six years. The western 23 prefectures of Japan, such as Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, and Okayama, have suffered unprecedented crop failures in recent years. The Japanese government has set a maximum rice price of 35.40 yuan. By September, the market price on the exchange had reached around 42 yuan, and people were paying nearly 50 yuan when buying from rice shops. The Japanese government is now trying to import the first batch from Taiwan to regulate the market and has again set a maximum rice price of 38.13 yuan.</p>
<p>Korea and Taiwan also Report Reduced Harvests</p>
<p>However, although the Japanese government has set price limits, rice prices continue to soar. Moreover, harvests in Korea and Taiwan are also lower than in previous years. According to the Japanese government, Korea's actual harvest this year is 13.99 million stones, a decrease of 10.13 million stones compared to last year. Taiwan's first rice crop yielded 4.03 million stones, a decrease of 860,000 stones compared to last year. In the past decade or so, Japan has had to import 8 to 10 million stones of rice from Korea and 4 to 5 million stones from Taiwan each year.</p>
<p>Entrusting Mitsui to Handle Purchases</p>
<p>However, considering the current situation, continued imports from Korea and Taiwan may be difficult. To plan for the future, it is said that Mitsui &amp; Co. has been entrusted to purchase rice from Wuhu, Jiujiang, Changshu, and Changzhou and transport it to North China for storage. This measure will not affect the inland areas. However, the Shanghai area may be affected to some extent if the Japanese side actually carries out this plan.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Associations Purchase in Large Quantities</p>
<p>It is reported that the price of rice in the producing areas is 14 to 15 yuan per stone. Even with transportation costs, expenses, and taxes, the cost per stone is only about 20 yuan. Therefore, the increase in rice market prices is clearly an intentional attempt to raise prices. However, rice price fluctuations have a significant impact on the livelihoods of citizens. Yesterday, a leader in the rice industry revealed that rice industry associations are currently trying to purchase large quantities and establish public warehouses for storage to stabilize public sentiment and lower rice prices. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association will hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors today (the 16th) at 3:00 PM to discuss storage and stockpiling matters. The rice industry hopes that the authorities will lead and eliminate public panic about the future food supply.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Rice from Nanjing and Shanghai Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, due to the active guerilla activities of Chinese troops in various areas, the Japanese side has halved the number of freight cars on both lines since the 8th (a total of 20 cars) to transport soldiers to various locations for reinforcement, resulting in sluggish freight transport. Rice has been affected the most, leading to a sharp increase in rice prices by as much as 2 to 3 yuan in a few days. By yesterday, the freight cars on both lines had returned to normal, and 10 additional cars were temporarily added due to excessive accumulation of goods at various stations. As a result, a large batch of rice from the interior arrived in port, totaling 6,000 stones, mostly high-quality white rice from Tongli and Kunshan. However, indica rice was in short supply. Public sentiment calmed down, and demand decreased accordingly, with few transactions. Except for a slight drop in the price of indica rice, the prices of all other varieties fell by more than one yuan.</p>
<h3>Armed Chinese Detained; British Troops Have Not Yet Released Them; It is Still Unclear Which Unit They Belong To; They Once Went on a Hunger Strike and Then Resumed Eating</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that on the morning of Friday the 5th, sixteen people in uniform carrying rifles, pistols, and hand grenades were disarmed and detained by British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment on Brenan Road. The sixteen people were very dissatisfied with their detention and went on a hunger strike at the end of the week. The incident started on Sunday morning when they told the British soldiers guarding the prison cell that they would not eat unless they were released. The British soldiers did not respond, so they carried out their hunger strike. By lunchtime, the sixteen people still refused to eat, but some of them looked quite haggard. By breakfast on Monday morning, they could no longer endure it, and the 24-hour hunger strike ended. As of last night (the 14th), no one had come to claim them, so they are still being held by the East Surrey Regiment. It is said that both the British troops and the detained people are gradually becoming tired of the situation, but neither side has taken any action regarding their release. The British military authorities have decided to wait a few more days for the sixteen people's masters to come and negotiate and then prepare to handle the case. However, there is some doubt as to whether anyone will claim them. According to the sixteen people, they arrived in Shanghai from Anhui Province ten days ago. However, they also seem to be unaware of who they work for. They were only given uniforms, guns, and hand grenades after arriving in Shanghai and were instructed to patrol the roads. They chose Brenan Road and were subsequently arrested by the East Surrey Regiment. The green uniforms they wore were different from those of the "Great Way" police or so-called "Self-Defense Corps."</p>
<h3>Increasingly Frequent Cargo Transport Between Shanghai and Ningbo</h3>
<p>Numerous Junks Gather Outside Zhenhai Port; Fifteen Merchant Ships and Sea Vessels in Total</p>
<p>The shipping route between Shanghai and Ningbo is extremely slow. In the past half month, no ships have returned to Shanghai from Zhenhai. It was not until the day before yesterday that the "Dapu" of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai from Zhenhai. After arriving in Shanghai, the ship entered the dock for annual repairs and will not sail to Zhenhai for the time being. The Norwegian merchant ship "Ningou," which sails to Zhenhai and is loaded with more than 5,000 tons, was chartered by three customs brokers and sailed to Zhenhai yesterday afternoon. It will then load local products from Zhenhai and bring them to Shanghai. This ship is operating on a short-term basis and will withdraw from the Shanghai-Ningbo route after the cargo has been loaded and transported. Junks from six provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, are gathering, and joint transportation will soon be implemented. Ningbo is now the only port of entry and exit, so cargo transport has suddenly become very busy recently. Numerous ships are gathered outside Zhenhai Port, including the merchant ships "Xin Xiangtai," "Shili," "Hanna," "Moufou," "Haida," "Deping," "Yongtai," "Xinjiang," "Haifu," "Maile," and the sea vessels "Chuguang," "Haiguang," "Baoguang," "Meinan," etc., totaling fifteen ships.</p>

<h3>Abandoned After Eight Years of Marriage; Came to Shanghai to Find Her Husband and Was Abused; Wife Sues for Living Expenses</h3>
<p>Liu Wang, a woman from Hejian, Hebei, residing at No. 241, Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, is 45 years old this year. Represented by lawyer Zhou Lianze, she filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Special Second District Court against her husband, Liu Shuzhi (43 years old, from the same village as Ms. Liu, currently residing at No. 226, Jin Shenfu Road, formerly the owner of the Xinxin Hotel), seeking living expenses. It is claimed that after the plaintiff and defendant married in the sixth year of the Republic of China, the defendant left eight days later on the pretext of seeking a livelihood and never returned for a long time. He then took Li, a concubine, in Qingxian, Hebei. When the plaintiff found out, she rushed to negotiate, but the defendant fled with the concubine. It was not until September of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China that she learned that the defendant and the concubine had opened the Xinxin Hotel in Shanghai. The plaintiff came to Shanghai accompanied by her father, but after only half a month, she returned to her hometown with him. In January of the following year, the plaintiff came to Shanghai alone and lived with the defendant. However, the defendant denied having a wife, and she was repeatedly abused by his concubine. After her elder brother came to Shanghai to mediate, he advised the plaintiff to live separately from the concubine for more than a year, and they lived in peace. However, the defendant, yielding to the concubine's wishes, terminated the lease on the plaintiff's house and stopped providing living expenses. After requesting mediation, her father came to Shanghai again and persuaded the defendant to allow the plaintiff to live with him in the current address at No. 241-5, providing meals and a monthly allowance. Unexpectedly, every time the plaintiff asked for the allowance, she was insulted and scolded by the defendant and his concubine. Starting in May of this year, the allowance was suddenly stopped, and starting on August 24th, meals were also stopped. The defendant's repeated difficulties clearly indicate his intention to put the plaintiff to death, and their relationship has completely broken down. Therefore, she is forced to sue for a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff living expenses until she reaches the age of 60, for a total of fifteen years and three months, at 30 yuan per month, totaling 5,490 yuan, and to approve a provisional attachment order to facilitate enforcement. The court, based on the complaint, held a hearing in the morning yesterday, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. Both parties were summoned to the hearing. The plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, arrived and recounted the past. The defendant testified that he had never interrupted the plaintiff's meals and that he had always given her an allowance of two or three yuan per month, and he had not stopped giving it. After considering the circumstances, the court instructed both parties to go outside and attempt a reconciliation, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Owner of Dingyuan Bank Robbed of Huge Sum</h3>
<p>Eight Thousand Japanese Yen Robbed; One Thief Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>The Dingyuan Bank at No. 243 Hankou Road has a branch at No. 287 Peng Road. The owner of the bank, Zhang Yiding, carried 8,000 Japanese yen (equivalent to 10,200 yuan in Chinese currency) from the Peng Road branch in his private car, driven by driver Guo Zixiang, at 8:30 AM yesterday morning, heading to the Dingyuan Bank on Hankou Road. Unexpectedly, when passing the intersection of Renfei Road and Hong Kong Road, two robbers suddenly appeared, one wielding a pistol, blocking the road and ordering them not to make a sound. They robbed all the Japanese yen and fled. One of the robbers, Huang Yicai, carrying a pistol, was reported to the police by Japanese detective Kobayashi and Chinese detective Yang Zhaoqing of the General Police Station when passing the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road. They worked with nearby Chinese police to arrest Huang, seizing a pistol and four bullets. Driver Guo Zixiang was also detained as a suspect. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi explained the incident, stating that it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices who were at large and to investigate whether Guo Zixiang was an accomplice. Therefore, he requested permission to adjourn the case. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, the two defendants were ordered to be detained and the case was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Merchants Driven by Greed; Exploitation Through Usurious Rates; Unauthorized Implementation of Bank Credit Loan System; Speculation and Trickery Affecting Social Economy</h3>
<p>Fang Rongshi, an employee of the Huadong Company at No. 581 Jing'an Temple Road, is usually good at accumulating wealth and managing his finances, so he has saved up a small amount of money. When the various banks in Shanghai promoted the credit loan system, Fang suddenly had an inspiration and seized the opportunity to use the name of credit loans to lend money at high interest rates. However, because he had not obtained the permission of the government authorities in accordance with the law and had speculatively and cleverly carried out the duties of a bank without authorization, he was criticized by informed people. However, Fang was a good businessman and worked hard to win over customers, and his business was not bad. Since the August 13th Incident, the social financial situation has become tight, and the credit loans of various formal institutions have mostly been put on hold temporarily out of consideration for the borrowers' difficulties. However, Fang had a whimsical idea and suddenly contacted the various debtors separately, using the bait of only seeking to recover the principal and not pursuing interest. As a result, many debtors tightened their belts and worked hard to repay the money. However, after the principal was fully recovered, Fang suddenly changed his attitude and threatened to sue to recover the interest. As a result, most of the debtors had IOUs and were afraid of being sued, so they dared to be angry but dared not speak out, and tried every means to raise money to settle the matter. Little did they know that the debts Fang invested in stated 100 yuan on the face of the note, but only 70 or 80 yuan were actually received. The interest had already exceeded the legal interest rate. Recently, a man named Qiu Xu borrowed 80 yuan on behalf of his friend Shen Yingzhen. After the war, Shen had left Shanghai, so Fang consulted with Qiu and agreed to repay the original amount in monthly installments of 5 yuan. Qiu believed that his friendship with Shen and Fang was deep, and because the IOU was in Qiu's name, he made a special request. Unexpectedly, after the original amount was repaid, Fang demanded interest. Qiu had no choice but to agree to continue repaying 5 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, Fang refused and sued in the First Special District Court. The case is scheduled to be heard today, and Judge Guo Wei will summon the parties. Although the amount involved in this case is small, it has a significant impact on the social economy. It is expected that there will be many interested people in the audience at that time, eager to see what happens.</p>

<h3>Xu Xigeng and His Concubine: Embezzlement and Theft; Keda Pharmaceutical Factory Requests Arrest and Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>Wu Zizhen, a native of Yin County, Zhejiang, of the Keda Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 444, Shanhai Pass Road, recently retained lawyer Cheng Zhengping to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court against Xu Xigeng, an employee, and his concubine, Xu Chen, for embezzlement and theft, and to attach a civil lawsuit. The main points of the prosecution are as follows: The defendant, Xu Xigeng, was formerly an employee of the factory. In early April of this year, on the pretext of returning to his hometown for recuperation, he took advantage of the opportunity to steal a cashier's receipt book, Nos. 8910 to 9000, and settlement sheets, etc., and secretly went to Jinhua, Zhejiang. In September of this year, he privately withdrew 13 boxes of Western medicine from the Gongyi Fengji Transportation Company, valued at 4,762.12 yuan in legal tender. After Zhang Bonian recovered some Western medicine worth 1,180.85 yuan from Gongyi, the remaining 3,581.27 yuan was embezzled and used for his own purposes. On August 14 of the same year, he privately collected 297 yuan in payment from the Ningbo Wuzhou Pharmacy, and on July 9, he privately collected 250 yuan from Dongyang Shi Wanchang, totaling 4,128.27 yuan. After the plaintiff learned of this, he sent someone to the Dongya Hotel in Ningbo to confirm that the defendant and his concubine, Xu Chen, had fled Shanghai from Ningbo on August 20 and were hiding in the concession, jointly and continuously embezzling. Although the plaintiff published a warning in the newspaper, they ignored it. They have committed the crime of embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and the crime of theft under Article 320 of the same law. He requests that they be arrested and severely punished according to the law and that the civil lawsuit be attached, ordering the defendants to jointly and severally compensate 4,128.27 yuan in legal tender. Yesterday morning, this case was heard by Judge Huang Risheng in Criminal Division 3. The defendants did not appear. Lawyer Cheng Zhengping, the plaintiff's agent, stated the reasons for the prosecution and requested an arrest warrant. The court ordered an adjournment for further verification.</p>
<h3>Jin Ying Radio Station Manager Kicks His Son</h3>
<p>Huang Guoping, manager of the Jin Ying Radio Station, a native of Songjiang, residing at No. 514, Shenzhou Hotel, Zhejiang Road, lives at No. 1352, Robison Road. Because he listened to reckless words, he kicked his 11-year-old son, Huang Renchu, born to his first wife, and was secretly reported to the police by his neighbors and arrested. He was sent to the First Special District Court. The interrogation was adjourned to a later date, pending examination of Huang Renchu's injuries. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. The victim, Huang Renchu, appeared in court and testified that his injuries had passed the danger period. As long as his father does not abuse him from now on, he is willing to go home with his father. However, he asked the judge to give him legal protection. Judge Qian asked the defendant, Huang Guoping, "Did you hear what your son said?" Huang Guoping replied, "I know. As long as Renchu listens to my instructions, I will never hit him again." After reviewing the testimony, the court adjourned the case for seven days for further hearing.</p>

When passing near the former site of Datong University on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, they were suddenly encountered by a fake "Western Shanghai Self-Defense Corps," which detained the truck and all the goods on the pretext of inspection. Despite repeated negotiations, they have not been released. It is heard that the fake corps said that a considerable price must be paid before they will be allowed to be redeemed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Coal Briquettes Attempted Dumping; Coal Briquettes Lowered in Price to Compete</h3>
<p>The Japanese side is dumping various goods in our occupied areas. Recently, the Japanese side shipped back various types of coal, totaling 1,400 to 1,500 tons, and first tried to sell them to coal merchants. Because few people wanted to buy them, the puppet regime came forward and established the Damao Coal Yard and Briquette Factory at Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, producing more than 100 tons of briquettes per day for dumping in Shanghai. Coal briquette factories in Shanghai announced yesterday that they would lower prices by 4 yuan per ton and 0.3 yuan per load to compete with Japanese goods.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We recently read your newspaper's November 15th edition, Section 3, page 11, which included an article about the three Zhao siblings, Zhao Fengzhang, Zhao Jinkun, and Zhao Xunmei, who were allegedly seduced by their cousin to steal their grandfather's savings account. The article stated that all three siblings were studying at schools such as Shanghai Guang. After investigation, our school does not have any students with these names. This is clearly an error. We hereby request that you correct the record.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Guang Middle School, November 15th</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I have recently seen a report on the relocation of the warehouse of the Beixin Bookstore in your newspaper of the 10th and 12th, which contains many inaccuracies. Our company previously leased a portion of the building at No. 168 Connaught Road to the Beixin Bookstore. Because the bookstore illegally sublet to other tenants, we sued and obtained a court judgment ordering them to vacate the premises within a specified period. The bookstore repeatedly exceeded the deadline and failed to comply. We then obtained a court eviction order and sent bailiffs several times to enforce the order, and hired workers to move the goods. To this day, the bookstore has not completely vacated the premises. Our company's handling of this matter is completely protected by law, and there has been no illegal action, nor was there any presence of the Xu brothers on the scene. We do not understand how the report could be so different from the facts. We have always admired your newspaper's accurate and detailed reporting, and we hereby submit this letter for clarification and correction. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Cannot Follow the Closing</h3>
<p>— Hearing the Song</p>
<p>The language exhibition has already closed. However, the actual language movement is still in its nascent stage, and it cannot "close" with the exhibition. Therefore, in order not to betray the meaning of this exhibition and to cooperate with the development of popular literature produced by the construction of mass literature, we should shoulder the responsibility of actively unfolding this movement.</p>
<p>No one can deny that language is not an antique for decoration, but a real thing; since it is real, it should take the masses as the standard for choice. What suits the masses, we must strive for and develop; what is not suitable for the masses, we must choose and discard; if it is completely wrong, then we can only ask it to avoid; other than that, there is no so-called compromise.</p>
<p>In the past, from Liang Qichao's liberation of classical Chinese to advocating the phonetic alphabet, we certainly cannot ignore its contribution to the language movement, but we cannot say that we have no opinions at all. The most obvious thing is that the spirit of compromising with the old things is too strong, so that in the end, it is still more considerate for the "small number of people" and less considerate for the "masses."</p>
<p>Although the old things have many advantages, they are only a few; and that must also be determined based on the real needs of the masses.</p>
<p>So what do the masses need? That is naturally "language unity." The so-called language unity is really the minimum requirement, and it can no longer be arbitrarily "discounted." Look at the vernacular written in square characters since the May Fourth Movement until today, how many articles can be regarded as truly unified in language? None, none! Why? In a word; it is because they did not think about the masses. What can be regarded as truly unified in language and can be accepted by the masses should be simple, reasonable, easy, universal and suitable for the needs of modern science. Regarding this, it seems that only the mass language constructed by the Latinized New Script can cope with it, because the New Script is a living script, so it is perfectly suitable for the living masses.</p>
<p>Now that we have this new script as the goal of the language movement, then we can do it without hesitation. However, some enthusiasts feel heartbroken, thinking that doing so betrays the history of Chinese characters too much and also obliterates its artistic value. In fact, this is too much of a misunderstanding of the principles of social evolution. Although the history of Chinese characters is very long, it is not immutable. For example, the transformation of ancient Zhou script into seal script, and the transformation of seal script into regular script, are they not all changes? This is just a commonplace. The current promotion of the new script is also a necessary phenomenon in the evolution of writing, so why look at it differently? Moreover, the promotion of this new script is purely for the sake of the masses.</p>
<p>Do it, let's promote the new script that considers the masses! If there is a language exhibition in a few days, I hope that there will be ten or a hundred times more achievements presented to everyone.</p>
<p>Really, the language movement cannot close with the exhibition, because the world is constantly progressing—not wrong! My nonsense.</p>
<h3>Two Girls — Picking up Memories from the Ashes of the Disaster —</h3>
<p>— Tang Wei</p>
<p>It was just the end of September, and on the streets of Harbin, thin clothes could hardly withstand the cold wind.</p>
<p>I pulled up the collar of my suit, put my hands in my trouser pockets, and squeezed my ribs with my arms. This walking posture may not be very spirited, so even the beggars on the side of the road didn't pay me any attention.</p>
<p>It took me two full hours to run from where I lived to the West Eight Market. By the time I found the reserved room number, the sun had already left no trace of light in the universe.</p>
<p>This was a house very close to the suburbs. Except for the road facing it and a few identical small rooms on the left, the north and west sides were a vast prairie.</p>
<p>I gently knocked on the door a few times, and an old Russian woman with white hair peeked out from inside. She just glanced at me and withdrew. Then there was a sound of leather shoes, and Pan ran out first, grabbing one of my hands.</p>
<p>"Have you recovered? Still coughing?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Still a little coughing!"</p>
<p>We came in, and a fair-skinned woman with a pair of round, big eyes stood facing us; compared to Pan's skin color, it simply made people doubt that they were not of the same ethnicity.</p>
<p>"My classmate Xu! This is where she lives." Pan introduced me.</p>
<p>I had seen Xu at a friend's banquet before, so she was a little surprised to see me today.</p>
<p>"I really didn't expect that the Mr. Liang that Pan mentioned was actually Mr. Tang."</p>
<p>She smiled charmingly.</p>
<p>"We met once at a friend's treat!" I explained to Pan.</p>
<p>The room was not very spacious, and with the large wardrobe in the corner of the wall, there was even less space; a wooden bed and a not-so-large desk were placed under the window. The bed sheets were dazzlingly white, and two photos were hung diagonally on the gray walls, which looked very elegant and compact.</p>
<p>Pan talked about what had happened in the past two months and the living conditions of the brothers in the mountains. In her conversation, I heard many exciting stories; at the same time, I also heard about the sacrifices of two friends and the injury of one friend.</p>
<p>"The biggest difficulty in the team is the lack of medicine." she stubbornly said.</p>
<p>"Some medicines have already been prepared; are there many wounded now?"</p>
<p>"There are nine people in total. If the medicines don't arrive, at least five people are in danger!" "Besides medicine, do you have any other missions this time?"</p>
<p>"The main thing is medicine; the other thing is to bring you the letter of condolences from Captain Sun and the friends in the headquarters!"</p>
<p>"I'm really ashamed. Everyone is desperately fighting in the hail of bullets, and I'm comfortably squatting on the streets of Harbin. How can I deserve everyone's condolences."</p>
<p>She handed me three or four letters together, and I shyly tore them open to read; while we were talking, I didn't notice when Xu went out. After I finished reading the letter, she bought bread, sausage, and a box of more polite Western snacks.</p>
<p>"Maybe Mr. Tang..." She quickly changed her words and said; "Or Mr. Liang hasn't eaten dinner yet, please have some snacks!"</p>
<p>She politely opened the snack box.</p>
<p>"This is too extravagant!"</p>
<p>"It's okay to have a little."</p>
<p>Pan didn't like snacks very much. She pinched a thick piece of bread crust and continued talking while eating;</p>
<p>"At the end of last month, the river overflowed its banks. The team was living in Changfa Village. In the middle of the night, they heard the sound of water. In less than ten minutes, the water had already reached their necks; hundreds of soldiers and civilians ran through the mud to Yuema Ridge; damn it, they ran into Li Xisan's men, and if it wasn't for Yu Sipao's (Note) relief, they would have had to fight to the death this time!"</p>
<p>She took a few bites of bread one after another, and then stuffed a piece of dried sausage.</p>
<p>Xu seemed to be unable to stand it, and persuaded her from the side!</p>
<p>"Eat slowly, dry crusts are not easy to digest!"</p>
<p>Pan didn't seem to pay much attention to her warning; she continued to talk;</p>
<p>"As a result, they gave us four hundred bullets, and the brothers asked them for two packs of cigarettes..."</p>
<p>"Are you living with Miss Xu today?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm living with Xu!"...</p>
<p>Finally, we decided on the method of carrying the medicines and arranged to see her again tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>When I returned, it was almost midnight, and the wind almost penetrated my bones. Two completely different girls were trembling in my mind like a bundle of fire.</p>
<h3>Grass under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— Lan Wen</p>
<p>Ancient City</p>
<p>There was news about that ancient city in the newspaper again. After reading it in one breath, I couldn't calm down a bit. So I folded up the newspaper.</p>
<p>The ancient city always evokes a line of fantasy in me, in the old days.</p>
<p>The sunset glow burns half the sky red. Wouldn't it be "infinitely good" to stroll on the city wall? (It's a pity it's just near dusk.) If there is someone walking beside you, you may even forget the time for dinner.</p>
<p>Looking at the ancient city, maybe there will be a gorgeous ancient dream?</p>
<p>But some people have complained about it in the past, didn't they just separate the petitioning team for the sake of a city?</p>
<p>Now, they say they want to demolish the city. Are you indignant?</p>
<p>If you know how to use silence to replace words, you should also know how to use action to vent your anger.</p>
<p>I opened the newspaper again, and I was looking for news of the ancient city's roar.</p>
<p>Traveler</p>
<p>Floating across the sea, the traveler returned from a distant place, where there is an unfree cage, and the devil's hand strangles people's throats, and no one has the freedom to breathe.</p>
<p>But, what about here? When the ship docked, the traveler was melancholy. "Crows all over the world are generally black", "Where is the pure land"? The beacon fire has gone far away, and the light has long followed.</p>
<p>It is the era of beacon fire, it is the years without laughter. Traveler, are you tired of trekking? Or are you tormented by some small misfortunes?</p>
<p>Don't play the song of weariness; you have to beat a war drum. Join the ranks of battle.</p>
<h3>Night Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xing</p>
<p>A small mountain stands alone, the lonely flowing water, the days are melancholic!</p>
<p>Golden dreams, purple dreams, dance gracefully, and finally hit the small nail of reality, shattered, extinguished. As a result, the whole world suddenly changed its appearance, and depression struck like a small snake, stubbornly wriggling in the body.</p>
<p>I envy the broad-shouldered man, and I admire even more the person with a strong heart; but I am so fragile that I am pitiful. (I remember thin ice, and a finger can poke a hole in it.)</p>
<p>The years pass silently, accompanied by the faint smoke from the roofs of people's houses. I have always locked myself in the house. Will the breath of the fields make me refreshed? Will the tempering of wind and rain make me stronger? It's time to go out. (In the vast night, I may be going on a long journey, greeting a greeting.)</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about? This year, this day." A friend who visited during the day asked. I am used to thinking, imitating the meditation of philosophers, and torturing that young life with bitter thoughts all day long. But, I didn't answer her words, I just smiled faintly.</p>
<p>The light yellow light drew a small circle, and my thoughts were also locked in this small world. "This year, this day" The short six words whipped fiercely. I, a little dizzy, I can't say that weight. However, I don't feel powerless about tomorrow." I know; "to live on".</p>
<p>Since we have lost our way, we can still bravely run forward; after any disappointment, we will not let the cry of the young conscience subside, and we will always find a broad road. I have such conviction.</p>
<h3>Struggle</h3>
<p>— Written by A.H. Olough, translated by Pinpin</p>
<p>Don't say that, struggle is ineffective,</p>
<p>Work and trauma are even more in vain,</p>
<p>The enemy will not retreat and will not be defeated,</p>
<p>Everything will not change.</p>
<p>If hope is the deceived, fear is the deceiver;</p>
<p>Look, in the hazy clouds on the horizon,</p>
<p>Your comrades are still chasing flying birds,</p>
<p>And you are standing still.</p>
<p>The tired waves sway in vain,</p>
<p>Like there is nowhere to flow,</p>
<p>But far away, through the stream, make an outlet,</p>
<p>The sea comes serenely.</p>
<p>Not only by the eastern window,</p>
<p>When the light of dawn shines brightly</p>
<p>When slowly climbing into the sky,</p>
<p>It is the West, look, the earth is also shining.</p>

<h3>A Humble Opinion on Improving Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>The decline of Peking Opera is an undeniable fact. The times can best determine everything in society. The modern mission of drama is the reflection of real life, not just the unchanged performance of history in the past. At the same time, every art contains the vitality of the author, whether it is an actor or a playwright. The meaning of old wine in new bottles is to use the existing form and attach completely new content. The script must be popular, because popularization itself is a very important part of the enlightenment movement; and the popularization of old wine in new bottles is a point worthy of attention in the issue of popularization. Undoubtedly, what the public's spirit is daily and likes to approach is the set of old-fashioned things. This old-fashioned thing contains countless feudal remnants and is unwilling to let go; therefore, injecting new content into the old-fashioned style is a good way to speed up the burial of old ideas in the remaining minds.</p>
<p>As for the method of improvement, the author's meaning is to adopt a gradual approach. Because Peking Opera has a solid history of hundreds of years, and the performance method has a deep-rooted impression in the minds of the audience. For example, "Liang Hongyu", "Fisherman's Hate", and "Peach Blossom Fan" directed by Ouyang Yuqian in the past were all very meaningful, but from a business perspective, they were obviously failures. The key to their failure is undoubtedly that the method of improvement was too radical, too poetic, and could not be harmonized with the entire stage personnel. The ordinary audience of the petty bourgeoisie could not help but be disappointed.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcomings of Peking Opera are the lack of contemporary scripts and profound and clear dialogues, and the performance method is also quite insufficient, but it is easy for the audience to accept. In order to continue its survival, it is necessary to fill it with various novel techniques. The current problem is to see who can shoulder this mission during this transition period.</p>
<p>The author is a loyal comrade of Peking Opera. In view of the trend of the great era, I feel that the old Peking Opera can no longer stick to the old ways. Therefore, I don't dare to show my clumsiness and briefly express my humble opinions for reference in arrangement.</p>
<h3>Wang Yurong's "Reading Problem"</h3>
<p>— Bai Ping</p>
<p>I recall when Wang Yurong was a singer in Nanjing, the issue of reading caused a sensation in society. I will now describe the process to give readers a smile. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wang Yurong was still a singer at the Feilongge Tea House in Nanjing Confucius Temple. Every time the lanterns were lit and she swayed onto the stage, the price she received was extremely limited. At that time, I was editing the news section of the Nanjing Evening News. One day, I received a news draft saying that a singer named Wang Yurong had changed her name to study at Jinghua Middle School in Beijing and was discovered by the school authorities and was often expelled. At that time, my brother Jia Huijian was editing the Qinhuaiyue section of the Nanjing Evening News. When he saw this news item, he was furious and said, "Why can't a singer study? In the autocratic era, it was possible that actors and prostitutes could not enter school. In modern Western countries, opera singers are regarded as noble arts. This kind of feudal thinking really needs to be criticized." So he first published an article to promote attention from people in society. All the newspapers in Beijing saw it and expressed their sympathy and responded one after another. At that time, the reporters stationed in Beijing from the Shanghai newspapers selected the most wonderful sentences from the newspapers' comments and sent them as special telegrams, because whether a singer could study or not had become a major issue in society.</p>
<p>At that time, Nanjing Jinghua Middle School was privately established by Chuan Kuanglin from Sichuan. Seeing that the attacks from the newspapers were very fierce, he entertained reporters and made a great speech, saying that when Wang Yurong came to the school to study, he did not know that she was a singer at first. He only saw that she had permed hair, exposed big legs, and wore glamorous clothes, which were quite seductive. Later, he went to Confucius Temple for social events and learned that this student was Wang Yurong, a singer. In order to rectify the school spirit, it was necessary to expel her. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau believed that Chuan's handling was appropriate, and Wang Yurong could only sacrifice her desire to study and the tuition fees she paid. What she gained was only the sympathy of the public opinion circle.</p>
<p>Soon, Yurong suddenly disappeared from the Qinhuai River. I don't know where she went. Someone asked her sister Wang Yuqin, who was also a singer at Confucius Temple. According to her, her sister really had the ambition to study and was not hypocritical. After being expelled from the school, she often sobbed at home and was depressed. Now that she saw that she could not realize her wish to study, she decided to go north to Tianjin and Peking, and seek in-depth training from famous teachers, hoping to become a famous actor. In a few years, I saw in the newspaper that Yurong had performed in a famous garden in Peking and was quite popular. This time, she was invited by Huang Jin to go south to continue performing, and she became famous in one fell swoop. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." And her spirit of aspiring to study, persevering and struggling is really commendable.</p>
<p>When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, I went to Shanghai and made a living by writing books. I often saw her sister Yuqin buying groceries at a South goods store around Huaihai Road. Sometimes she held a baby in her arms, presumably she was married and was a housewife. Compared with her sister, she was really insignificant.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Hong Kong Singing Girl"</h3>
<p>— Gu Fen</p>
<p>The plot of "Hong Kong Singing Girl" tells the pitiful life of a singing girl. It especially inserts a little more love component than "Elastic Daughter". Lu Ming's performance is indeed quite impressive. What is worth mentioning about this film is the addition of many newcomers. The director is Sun Jing. It is his first time directing a film, and his technique is very clear. Yu Lin, Yue Lin, Yan Hua, and Cao E all did a very good job.</p>
<p>After watching this film, we have a feeling that many of those pitiful people in the pink-collar profession group who lack reason are willing to be playthings for those so-called rich old men to flirt and have fun, which is really lamentable? After "Hong Kong Singing Girl", we believe that at least some people will be moved by it and change their outlook on life. Therefore, we are willing to introduce this work to women in social occasions.</p>

<h3>Chinese "Nora" on stage</h3>
<p>The "Women's Liberation" sponsored by the Young Women's Association and performed by the Haiyan Drama Club is Ibsen's original work "Nora". In order to suit the performance at this time and place, it was adapted and Chineseized by Yi Qiao. The play is a world-famous masterpiece and has a long-standing reputation in China. There is no need to repeat it. It is now scheduled to be performed at the evening show this Friday, the matinee on Saturday and Sunday, and the evening show on Sunday (only three shows) in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. It is also heard that a preview will be held at 9:00 am on Friday to entertain criticism from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Statement According to news from Tongren Hospital, Liu Jiqun was sent to the hospital for treatment after a stroke, and there was no refusal to accept him. This statement is made specifically.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Most dramas are at odds with official history. According to my Xu Zhi book, Zhou Shi was a man from Fengshan, Suining. The Yuji Temple built on the top of the mountain still exists today. Extremely detailed murals are painted on both sides of the gate, depicting Yuji's battle map. Lady Zhou was also brave and good at fighting, unlike in the drama, where she only drew her sword and committed suicide, which led to the submersion of Lady Zhou's martial strategy. It is also said that Yuji had another son who escaped, which is the so-called "loyal and good people will not have no descendants". In a corner of Fengshan, the Zhou family has a large number of descendants, who are probably Yuji's descendants. In the early years of the Republic of China, Zhang Xun was stationed in Xucheng and arrested and killed revolutionary party members, which was heard every day. A Mr. Zhou Zhongmu was a member of the old Tongmenghui and was teaching at the Seventh Normal School in the city. He often instilled revolutionary ideas in his students. Later, someone secretly reported to Bian Shuai and Zhou was arrested. After Zhou Peizhang, he denounced the crimes of the warlords without the slightest fear. In a few days, he was shot by Zhang. Before his death, he sat cross-legged and was calm. His scholarship and morality were respected by the villagers. Only after his death did they know that Mr. Zhou was also a descendant of Yuji. His heroic behavior was enough to be compared with his ancestor. I think if the "Ningwu Pass" drama can be adapted and performed in Peking Opera, scenes such as the lady's street battle can be added, which can be played by a martial actress, and it will be even more exciting.</p>
<p>Old actors rely on patience to eat, new artists rely on support to make money</p>
<p>It is commonly said that "old people and yellowed pearls are worthless," but who knows that Wang Lao's worship of Yao Qing has turned out to be a great success. This time, the Golden Authority originally intended to have Wang Yurong take over the team after De Zhu, but because Yao Qing accompanied her beloved apprentice to the south, it caused the attention of various newspapers, who competed to promote it in advance, so Yurong's value also increased invisibly.
