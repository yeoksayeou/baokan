<p>社評</p>
<h3>張伯倫政策之前途</h3>
<p>本報昨刋倫敦特的通訉，叙述張伯倫氏之外交政策；根據各種觀點，歸納而得若干深刻之論斷；其間臚舉之資料，頗多爲往日海外電訉所傳播而未詳，深信善讀報紙之讀者諸君必能有得於此通信。</p>
<p>通信中允可注意之點凡三：（一）張伯倫政策不足以代表英國朝野之意念，祇以今日之事，張爲政，故英國最近之所作爲雖經反對之者加以修正，但仍以張伯倫政策爲骨幹。（二）張伯倫政策爲對德對日儘量讓步，犧牲金鎊以賄遷德國固爲張伯倫所不吝，更復慷他人之慨而準備捐棄中國蘇聯以及菲洲與南美。（三）反對張伯倫政策者，不但英國國內之在野黨，即保守黨淸明之士亦努力予以牽制；不但爲張伯倫政策所準備捐棄之國家及旣爲所犧牲之國家，即美國亦不願見張伯倫政策之自誤誤人；就德國言之，明知受張籠絡不無近利，祇以別有遠慮，故亦未甘墜彼彀中；因此多方之反對，斷言於張伯倫政策弄巧成拙，終於失敗。凡此通信中之所指陳，各有所本，初非捕風捉影，惡意曲解；猶憶上月下旬，英日東京談判初步協定尚未確立之際，本報嘗謂「英國之國際政策夙爲世人不予信任，故在近年風在雨暴之中，世論之鼓勵英國者爲多，而依恃英國者極少，」茲證以通信所叙述，知前論未謬也。</p>
<p>雖然、張伯倫政策之體態，彷彿多稜之立體，平面觀察固不足以狀其本相，即數面觀察亦復遽難盡其全貌。昨刋通信，旣作數面觀察，所以刻畫張伯倫政策之輪廊者，饒有價值；然於政策之推進焉，將以遭遇之不拘一格，反應之演變無窮，使彼政策動定之重心，及其開展之形態與方嚮，隨時改觀：使彼政策之收穫，與彼所預期者相殊，甚或相反。蓋張伯倫者，謂個性强，母寗謂韌，處事鍥而不舍；非雄才偉略足以處變，而老謀勝算足以掩護其短；有嘗試艱鉅之勇，却無不顧遭遇，不顧反應之勇，故不致倒行逆施；輔弼之者西門，陰沉褊執，蔚爲張伯倫之黑影；行動不離者陽傘，雖可張可闔，耍不足以當風雨，則恰如其所不願捨棄之妥協綏靖；此一人一物者，實張伯倫爲人爲政之象徵所寄也；兩年來張伯倫所映射於吾人眼底心頭者若此，亦即吾人於兩年來所得於張伯倫之觀感也。惟其然，張伯倫政策雖有其本來面目，如昨刋通信所云云，然仍視遭遇與反應而轉變；是誠不免爲史家所誅伐，然在今茲，未可遽謂張伯倫政策竟無復前途！</p>
<p>張伯倫與其政策之本來面目，信如上述之剖析而不謬，則爲國際大局計之，爲珍惜此世界之强大如英國之力量者計之，應母使之深入歧途；抑事勢固有糾正深入歧途之可能，要在明示張伯倫以其所將遭遇與其必然之反應而已。就遠東問題言之：吾人竊未以所謂結歡日本與瓜分中國二語爲盡當；藉日信然，則彼所遭遇者反應者，日本之壟斷企圖也，排英運動也，中國之決心抗戰也，自力更生也，美國蘇聯諸國之對華同情援助也，凡此者，俱已爲此二語作反面之註釋。上月杪，美國宣告廢止美日商的，此其造就之新局面，乃爲張伯倫政策推進時所接觸之對象。昨日美法兩國爲天津存銀問題而對日本作堅定坦白之表示，此種聲勢，亦足爲張伯倫政策轉變之後勁。中國軍隊最近在山西太行山麓所予進攻者以嚴重之打擊，此則至少良供懷疑於中國抗戰前途，迷信於日本武力萬能者以重行估價之嶄新資料，而喚醒妥協綏靖之迷夢。總而言之：張伯倫政策殆不如所傳之惡劣，然目前之種種情勢，固趨向光明而不容萬惡滋長者也；循張伯倫政策而直綫推進，吾人無以想像其前途，然目前之種種情勢，固已爲張伯倫政策造就轉向光明之坦途。</p>
<h3>各地反英行爲　純屬日方發動　目的在排除英在華利益　津英領提抗議日尙未復</h3>
<p>（重慶）前敎育部長現任中英文化協會主席王世杰、今日託路透社發表文告如决、華北與其他日方侵佔地之反英運動、純屬日方發動者、志在將英國利益排出中國、並强迫英國接受日方之逾度要求、此乃不可誤會者、已往十年來、中英關係日臻和睦、而中國人民對於英人、具有友好情威、因東京談判而起之現局、使深切關懷中英友誼者、稍起焦慮、此固事實、然余確信如英國負責政治家、所發將繼續共政策在經濟上援助中國之保證、果見諸實施、如倫敦若干有勢力報紙所主張者、則此等焦慮、將盡歸消失、而中英友誼、將益臻堅强、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（漢口）日方所辦之武漢報、今日稱、滬戰發生之二週紀念日、漢口將舉行大規模之反英示威游行、而日備亦將參加、日僑將先集於神社、然後赴英領館呈交決議案一通、後再至城內參加華人示威游行、衆信華人未必游行於前英租界內、今日各處皆遍貼反英標訴、但無人加以注意、大的明日各處將有反英演說、（十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（天津）英國駐天津總領事詹姆森、昨日向日本總領事田代、提出關於華北反英示威之書面抗議、要求日本當局壓制佔領區域內續有之反英活動、及保護英國產業、日本方面、截至發電、尚未提出覆文、（十日海通社電）</p>
<h3>美運輸專家　卽可抵港</h3>
<p>（重慶）據今日此間消息、交通部現派潘某爲代表、於今日乘飛機往香港、歡迎將於二十二日抵此之美國運輸專家七名、聞此七名運輸專家、乃由中國駐美經濟代表陳光甫與美財長摩要韜商量之後始派來中國者、其任務在指導中國加速公路運輸之方法、前月赴美之國民政府財政顧問貝克博士、亦與七人同來、聞七人抵港後、將赴海防至昆明、沿途以汽車三輛卡車二輛、視察公路情况、以便至重慶後、向國民政府提出意見書、此後更將赴西北考察公路交通狀况、（十日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>厦北海港　爲日封鎖</h3>
<p>（香港）據今日此間消息、在厦門北一百英哩之修水（譯音）海港、已於星期日爲日本海軍以水雷等物所封鎖、（十日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>西南旅行實錄　（續）　七·桂林之印象</h3>
<p>有人說、「湘桂鐵路是抗戰時期的大動脈、」假如眞是如此、則桂林可說是湘桂路的心臟、它負有交換和流通湖南廣西兩省的一切人力物力資源的職責、同時在廣東省東南部僵化的現狀　、它也兼司粤北的接濟、故稱爲湘粤桂三省通銜、允無愧色、假定以桂林爲中心、向南有公路、經平樂·賀縣、水路經平樂·昭平。至蒼梧、向西南可經荔浦·榴江·至柳州、將來湘桂鐵路桂南段通車以後、還可抄永福的近路、向東北則循湘桂路已成的桂衡段至衡陽、接上粤漢鐵路北至採州、南抵曲江、水路則可利用湘江上流、吸收沿江·零陵·祁陽·一帶的農產、以溝通湘南的貨運、</p>
<p>從柳州到桂林的分路、經榴江後、折向東南、須至荔浦後方重向北開、所以也有二百七十公里路程、汽車的行七小時、但沿途過渡極多、時間上還得算寬一些、從柳州到鹿寨有兩渡、榴江過去又是一渡、午間達廣西東部公路中心的荔浦、行人多在此午餐、所以公路兩旁、市面很繁盛、荔浦以北的河上、已建有長橋、可省去一渡、但到了陽朔之後、發現原有的橋樑、已被山洪冲燬、所以仍補上一渡、陽朔江以水淸聞名、「陽朔山水甲桂林」一語之來由、即在於江水的陪襯、我們利用挨决過渡的時間、儘量領略山光水色、覺得足以補償時間上的耗費、</p>
<p>過良豐後、公路漸壞、允其是接近桂林南門的一段、簡直滿地是傷痕、汽車經過時、顚簸得極厲害、開得快些、眞有翻車的危險、據說這是五噸以上的重車經過得太多的緣故、</p>
<p>汽車停在南門外、受過軍警檢查後、方得入城、一進城的景象、便和城外完全不同、街上是擠不開的行人、街邊却是斷壁荒墟、形成很奇突的對照、桂林的正街、原祇有兩條、一條是自南至北的幹路、分成四段、最南和最北的呌桂南路和桂北路、中間的兩段呌中南路和中北路、中心穿過一條橫街、西段呌桂西路、曲折由麗澤門出城、東段呌桂東路、由東江門出城、這幾條路都有被炸的痕跡、其中除桂東路和中南兩路尚相當完整外、其餘多炸得七零八落、允其是桂南路、差不多都燒完了、</p>
<p>桂林各山洞、都是天然的避難所、防空部繪有詳圖、劃淸那一區的民衆遇警時、往何處避難、一有警報、全城皆空、所以歷决轟炸、房屋雖燒燬甚多、居民死傷却很少、不得不歸功於岩洞、前些時候、日方揚言要炸岩洞、但據人估計、須一千公斤的炸彈二十枚、丟在同一地方、才能在岩洞的山頂上開一個天窗、這眞是談何容易、</p>
<p>桂西路一帶、是桂林新興的文化區、樂羣路上的樂羣社、是文化人集中的地方、最近爲紀念七七二週年、曾在這裏舉行戰利品展覽會、由行營主辦、江南各戰區、都有戰利品送桂陳列、計有飛機殘骸·降落傘·中型戰車·各種機關槍及其他武器文件、此外並有自製抗戰形勢地圖、及各種統計、觀衆每天數萬人、</p>
<h3>定海日軍　搜索金塘島　自衛隊奮勇迎擊</h3>
<p>定海通信、定海縣屬金塘島、位處舟山羣島之西南、孤懸海隅、與鎭海·穿山·相鄰近、島上共分金一·金二·金三·等三鄕、居民的六七千人、爲舟山之大島、以產李子著名、稱「金塘李子」、自定海沈家門淪陷後、居民相率渡海至金塘避難、或由金塘轉道至鎭海寗波暫避、致住民激增、島上甚形繁榮、詎五日拂曉、突有日本第一艦隊第四號一艘、駛至該島瀝港對出海面停泊、嗣即放下汽艇三艘、分載日兵六十四名、蜂擁在瀝港登陸、並以機槍向天空及各山林掃射、一面徐徐搜索全島、當地自衛隊聞訊、即四出分伏山岙迎頭痛擊、卒因衆寡懸殊、乃退守各山頭、待機反攻、日軍搜索後、因恐華方自衛隊乘機襲擊、不敢久留、乃紛紛竄回艦中、向定海方面逸去、</p>
<h3>日軍企圖　在象山登陵　石浦鎭警隊堅决抵抗　日軍未遑滋擾後退去</h3>
<p>寗波通訊、象山縣屬石浦鎭、地濱沿海、爲浙省唯一魚業市塲、本月六日上午七時許、有日機一架、飛石盤旋窺察、旋駛到日艦七艘、似有登陸企圖、象縣府據報、當嚴飭就地警隊、誓死抵抗、並派自衛隊一中隊、馳往增援、至九時許、復來日機二架、開始投彈、同時有小型日艦三艘、、汽艇五隻、駛入石浦港內、向岸開放機槍、十時許、又駛人汽艇二隻日艦開始放砲、迄下午一時、槍砲聲未間斷、並有日艦一艘、靠近碼頭、華方警隊、預先登山佈防、踞高臨下、日軍未能得逞、至二時許、日機始離去、三時許、日艦連刦民帆船十二艘後、亦怏怏逸去、是役華方死軍民六名、傷七人、</p>
<h3>南洋華僑之動態　兩年間匯回三千萬元　技術工人回國築鐵路</h3>
<p>關於抗戰後南洋華僑情形、頃有李巧光潘志輝二人、由星島及棉蘭來滬採辦國貨、茲據談話如下、</p>
<p>新加坡爲英屬馬來聯邦之首都、聯邦政府包括麻六甲·柔佛·吉靈丹·霹靂·濱城·雪蘭娥·森美蘭·等羣島、此處爲英國在遠東最大軍事根據地、闢爲軍港、與印度及香港保持密切之軍事聯繫、棉蘭則爲荷屬蘇門答臘羣島東部之首都、自上海往該兩地、星島（即新加坡）限制每月五百人進口、手續較簡、往棉蘭則須取得出國護照、如往該地經營工商業」或就其他職業、並須得荷印政府批准、覓有當地妥保、繳納進口稅一百五十盾、（每盾合法幣十五元左右）手續較繁、赴星島川資如乘郵船二等艙、的須十二鎊、赴棉蘭的三十鎊、星島距棉蘭五百海里、</p>
<p>星島人口的共八九十萬、華僑佔六十萬、白種人的一二寓、馬來土人則大半散居內地、蘇島（即蘇門答臘）有華僑二三十萬、棉蘭一部佔二三萬、兩地氣候均爲半熱帶、叫季常在八十度左右、在星島英國設有聯邦政府、統治馬來羣島、各屬地則由蘇丹分治、聯邦政府下設華民政務司、專事辦理華僑事務、中國現任駐星島總領事爲高凌百、蘇島由荷蘭政府設荷印總督統治一切、總督署設吧城、中國駐棉蘭領事爲季易凡、</p>
<p>兩地華僑、以閩粤人佔最多數、星島爲無稅口岸、其性質與香港同、華僑經營工商業甚發達、以木材·布疋·洋什貨·瓷器·等商店爲最多、土產以樹膠•咖啡·茶糖·檳榔·波羅·椰柑·棕油·爲大宗、並有錫鐵等鑛產、投資於種植事業者、以英美荷三國人爲多數、運往星島之棉織品、受相當限制、自抗戰後、僑胞對國貨、均樂爲購用、</p>
<p>關於文化事業、星島有大學兩所、一爲萊佛士學院、一爲醫科大學、均爲英政府所辦、醫科大學頗負盛譽、華僑所辦之學校有華僑中學·南洋女中、私立中正中學·及公私立小學校多所、均屬提學司管理、棉蘭則有蘇東中學一所、及小學二三十所、由蘇島敎育總會管理、星島報紙有五種、計爲星洲日報·星中日報、總匯報·南洋商報·新國民日報、棉蘭有蘇門答臘民報·及新中華報兩種、均屬商辦、自抗戰發生後、華僑愛國熱忱、達於最高度、無論工商學各界、不辭勞苦、每日爲祖國宣傳抗戰及難民救濟工作而奔走、各地均有籌賑會組織、募集之款、或直接匯往中央財政部、或交由籌賑會轉匯貴陽紅十字會、星島兩年來滙往祖國之款在二千萬元以上、蘇島亦近千萬、僑胞並按月繳納救國捐、對提倡國貨及抵制日貨運動、亦極努力、星島技術工人回國參加建築滇緬鐵路者、有千餘人、回國參加軍隊抗戰者、亦有數百人、英荷政府、因同情中國抗戰、對僑胞愛國運動、並不過分壓制、各處均有僑團之組織、團結一致、以從事救國運動、</p>
<h3>蘇省　運隄培修工程　已完成三分之二</h3>
<p>泰縣通訊、蘇省府對於預防黃水入運一事、曾令飭江北運河工程局、趕將沿運東堤、加高培厚、並令有關各縣縣長、盡量協助進行、頃聞河工局自奉令後、督同各段工程事務所、加緊培修、並悉刻下全部工程、已完成三分之二、其高度禦水二丈、再於堤頂加鑲子堰二尺、計共禦水二丈二尺、至近來運河水勢、迄至本月二日止、御馬頭水誌達一丈零三寸、較之去年同日、低落二尺七寸、湖水水位、每常伏汎時期、必特別盛漲、而木年來勢、亦不過猛、聞三日之水誌、計一丈零八寸半、比較去年是日、亦低落很多、且本年下河底水極小、秋收已陸續登塲、即使黃水南來、如量不過大、有此未雨綢繆之種種防禦、似不致有極大之危險云、</p>

<h3>外匯暴縮聲中　羅傑士來滬堪重視　與英大使及滙豐等會商　傳此行已獲有初步結論　羅氏昨日已返港</h3>
<p>中英平凖基金委員會英方代表羅傑士、爲明瞭上海黑市外滙、曁英國對華貿易中國法幣運用情形、來滬與英國在滬官商、作三日之會談、頃巳事畢、於昨日離滬赴港、據悉羅傑士氏此次來滬、允注意於上海黑市外滙之趨勢、渠與滙豐麥加利銀行負責人之晤談、會獲有初步之結論、英商領袖、亦會對羅氏有所陳述、至華商金融界方面、因時間忽忽、並未晤見、一般預料氏此行將以視察所得、赴港與宋子文·貝祖詒·等作意見上之交換、惟衆信氏此行於中國法幣當作有利之規劃、詳細情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>羅傑士氏由港抵滬</p>
<p>平準外滙基金管理委員會英方代表（委員）羅傑士、對中國幣制之改革、頗有勞績、今已於三日前由香港抵滬、其行踪頗爲秘密、外界知者甚鮮、惟羅氏於本星期二三兩日下午、分訪滙豐·麥加利·兩行經理郝樞民·麥萊會談、並與英駐華大使寇爾及英國在華商業領袖商議一切、內容如何、雖未宣佈、惟聞與中國法幣及黑市外滙有關、</p>
<p>商談事畢昨已赴港</p>
<p>羅傑士氏來滬、與英國在滬官商領袖作分別之懇談後、大致對外匯法幣及上海一般金融情形、業已瞭然、當因尚須與香港中英金融界有所洽談、即匆匆於昨日搭乘維多利亞輪離滬赴港、臨行時、羅氏在滬友好、均往歡送、</p>
<p>平準委會維持外滙</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晨向中外銀行界探悉、羅傑士之來滬、與上海黑市外匯、及中國法幣價值有關、聞平準外匯基金委負會、雖竭力維持外匯、使法定外匯、始終穩定英匯一先令二辦士半、美匯三十美元、對必需品之輸入、儘量供給法定外匯、所以非淪陷區城之各地、從未有所謂外匯黑市者、所謂黑市外匯者、僅上海等淪陷區域而已、</p>
<p>黑巿暴縮有益中國</p>
<p>上海外匯黑市、因投機者之作祟、一再猛扒、致造成畸形局面、昨晨英商匯豐銀行掛牌又縮、英匯三辦士半、美滙六元八一二五、聞下午趨勢稍回、匯豐掛牌英匯昨日下午三辦士五九三七五、美滙七元、此决黑市趨縮、與中國整個有益無損、使中國土貨、得源源輸出、奢侈品及非必需品之進口、因黑市外匯緊縮而大受影響、中國之入超、可望减少、國際收支、能得平衡、平準外匯基金會、對上每黑巿之外匯、決聽其自然、</p>
<p>黃金又漲債劵趨跌</p>
<p>昨日黑市外滙、旣續告縮、黃金暗巿、復又上漲、卒仍向高峯疾進、開盤價為四千二百二十元、嗣買勢鼎、漲至四千三百五十元、復又起落不定、午刻復升至四千三百四十元、下午收盤為四千三百五十元、較昨漲二百元、至於證劵行情、昨日統一甲種四十八元四角、乙種四十一元六角、丙種三十九元五角五分、丁種三十八元五角、戊種三十九元、</p>
<p>羅氏使命未能確悉</p>
<p>大陸報云、上海金融界對中英平準基金管理委員會英國代表即英倫銀行之羅傑士來滬已三日、與各金融領袖會談事、加以若干重視、聞羅氏於星期二日午後分訪滙豐與麥加利兩銀行人員、而於昨日（九日）復訪之、叉聞諸可靠方面、羅氏確與兩銀行人員晤談甚久、據本埠消息靈通之金融界聲稱、羅氏已與本埠若干英商領袖曁駐華英大使寇爾爵士會談、但此說未能獲得直接證實、而談話性質、亦未披露、就繼續支持法幣而言、羅氏來滬、是吾有何特殊重大意義、昨夜未能確悉、惟事實在於渠來本埠與滙豐麥加利兩銀行之談話、對於法幣市價並無影響、直至昨夜、公衆始悉渠抵本埠固屬事實、惟金融界則已熟知其活動矣、</p>

<p>兩租界之宵禁法令、本目晚十二時半至翌晨六時爲止、惟平日每於淸晨四時左右、即可通行、故實際已無形縮短、惟每屆革命紀念節日期、對於宵禁、均依規定辦理、今旣實施特別戒備、故昨晨法租界方面在四時後、仍不准行人通行、直至五時三刻、方獲自由行走、</p>
<p>封鎖橋樑統制交通</p>
<p>蘇州河一帶橋樑、計外白渡橋。乍浦路橋。四川路橋、自戰後即由日方控制、近以八一三將屆、日方仍將乍浦路·四川路·新閘路·各橋斷絕往來、僅白渡橋一處可通虹口、其餘江西路橋·盆湯弄橋·西藏路橋、則由公共租界封鎖、老閘橋僅准行人往來、浙江路橋僅准車輛通行、天后宮橋車輛行人、均可通過、各橋甫北堍、均由武裝探捕駐守、實施搜查、</p>
<p>北江西路戒備森嚴</p>
<p>北江西路南起自來水橋北境、北迄老靶子路、東端一埭商店住戶、以及里衖、自被日方以木桿及有刺鐵絲欄架、僅崇明路口·文監師路口。海寗路口·留有三　隙、該路自前日起、因租界當局加嚴戒備、除日方封鎖區所留缺口、仍照以前通行、未經堵塞外、該路西端、特由租界當局布置鐵絲網、除海寗路及七浦路兩處留有缺口、日探捕站崗守衛、檢查行人外、其他通北江西路之橫路及里衖、槪行堵塞、即北江西路南盡頭、靠近北蘇州路處、亦予攔斷、祗許在七浦路西面缺口處、可以進出、</p>
<p>公共汽車抄出手槍</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界與法租界巡捕及防軍按照特殊戒備計劃作第二日之防範、兩租界中絕未發見恐怖份子之活動、但昨日（九日）通宵與今晨巡捕繼續在本市各區拘捕可疑人物、今覊捕房者共逾千人、法租界巡捕昨在愛多亞路搜查第二十一路法商公共汽車、自華籍靑年一人身畔抄出手槍一枝、乃加逮捕、其人雖拒不向捕房吐露渠爲何人、惟捕房相信渠與恐怖團體或盜黨有關、</p>
<p>法租界搜查兩旅社</p>
<p>昨日上午六時、法警務處派大批中西武裝探捕、分乘警備車馳赴鄭家木橋街三十三號大方飯店。與朱葆三路十四號牛安大旅社兩處搜查各房間放客·行李·箱篋、幷對各旅客均予詳細盤詰、搜查結果、一無所獲、</p>
<p>各國駐軍協助警戒</p>
<p>兩租界除制止各種集會、並封鎖一部份馬路交通外、復出動全部鐵甲車·巡邏隊·便衣隊·車巡隊四出巡查、隨路檢查行人車輛、公共租界方面之萬國商團、亦協同維持治安、英駐軍維持虞洽卿路以東區域、美駐軍防範虞洽鄕路以西勞勃生路以南地段、意駐軍保護勞勃生路北及越界築路部份、法駐軍及安南兵、則負法租界之治安</p>
<p>南巿日軍巡行示威</p>
<p>後日爲滬戰紀念、日言深恐愛國份子乘機出擊、故早數日即在其佔領之虹口·滬西·南市·浦東·閘北各區、從事加緊防禦工作、各處橋樑、除滿佈沙袋鐵絲網外、每橋由日軍四人、僞警二人、駐守搜查、沿浦各碼頭、亦加增崗位、在其所訂之通行時間、方許往來、滬西方面、因昆連租界、故各紗廠之駐軍、均已出動、昨晨八時至十時半間、南市駐軍、並以鐵甲車·砲車·小鋼砲·機關槍等武裝士兵三百餘人、巡行城區、似含有示威性質、</p>
<h3>統一甲種八次還本　昨晨舉行抽籤　還本三百七十五萬元　明年一月底開始付款</h3>

<p>主席報吿</p>

<h3>上川綫偽軍　已起變化　徐曹張秦各部僞軍　分向浦南歸附投誠</h3>
<p>浦東祝橋日軍、令當地民衆、與游擊隊談判、日軍退出祝橋、但以游擊隊不再攻擊爲條件、據來人云、日軍已經退出、另在車站重建防禦工事、圖保鐵路安全、日方並征調徐鴻發僞軍一部、同往閘北、並繼續征調其餘之部隊、但此外、曹維周一部、不聽徐之調動、張妙根部下之沈某等二中隊亦反正、投往浦南范根才部、至秦興炎部、除其高橋之基本一部外、在上川路各鎭者、均歸附張惠芳、</p>
<h3>堆棧倉庫通吿提貨　預防秋汛</h3>
<p>黃浦江首决秋汛高潮、將於本月十五日起開端、故各沿江堆棧倉庫、分別通告貨主、提取存棧貨物、一面並整理預防工事、江海關亦在面江大門下端、裝置水泥木板、以資抵禦潮水侵入、</p>
<h3>英駐華海軍司令　茂萊大將抵滬　在華北海面曾作多時巡弋　英巡洋艦自威駛靑島增防</h3>
<p>英駐華海軍司令茂萊大將、於九日乘英巡洋艦「考華爾」號由戚海衛來滬、茂萊司令在華北海面游弋、並巡視多時後、始於九日下午三時三十分抵埠、現該「考華爾」英艦泊英海軍浮筒、聞茂萊司令、在滬頗有躭擱、叉悉英巨型巡洋艦「肯特」號、於九日晨由威海衛駛往靑島海面增防、聞有二三日之停泊、然後再駛返威海衛、參加夏季演操、英海軍部消息、英艦「悌康」號（Decoy）確於九日晨載遝食物開赴福州接濟該處被封鎖之英僑、報載該七十五號英驅逐艦「悌康」號、開出口外巡弋不確、</p>
<h3>航業界接電話　日機又炸奉化　前晨日機五架共投十彈　僅傷七人毀屋七十餘間</h3>
<p>日方近以對華戰事、泥足深入、毫無進展、故迭决派機騷擾後方、轟炸不設防城市、殘殺無辜平民、企圖威脅人心、浙東各地如寗波鎮海海門溫州象山餘姚慈谿紹興等處、均先後慘遭肆虐、允以寗波鎮海兩處、災情最重、但此種行爲、適足以增人民之反感、據本市航業界昨日接甬方來電、奉化前日上午、又遭日機肆虐、原電云、九日上午八時、日機五架、至奉化作第二决轟炸、計投十彈、中山公園大纏堂旁落一彈、中山公園關帝廟二彈、北街二彈、蝴蝶弄電話局旁一彈、西街祥房弄一彈、百步嶺等處三彈、重傷四人、輕傷三人、毀屋七十餘間、餘無損失、</p>
<h3>外輪海防貨運　並未間斷　但不能立刻運內地　各報關行已辦聯運</h3>
<p>滬防航錢、首由怡和·太古·兩公司、派輪航行以後、其他各外商輪船、亦追隨行駛、斯時海防爲貫通內地唯一之孔道、故一時航運空前繁盛、以致運至海防之貨、堆積如山、但該處車輛缺乏、一時不易疏散、駐滬客商遂</p>
<p>不敢多辦</p>
<p>故最近滬防錢之貨運、較前减色不少、至前日報載、太古·怡和兩公司拒裝海防貨一節、全非事實、因昨晨太古公司尚有太原輪由滬開往海防、兼灣香港、計運往海防貨、疋頭棉紗肥皂雜貨等、共一千一百四十餘件之譜、較前</p>
<p>略為遜色</p>
<p>而已、怡和洋行裕生輪、亦定本月十三日（星期日）自滬赴港防、但運往海防之貨、不能立刻運往內地、爲目下實在情形、故近有貿通·進源·兩報關行、與中法快運社合辦滬昆聯運、將貨由滬運至西貢、自西貢裝火車</p>
<p>直駛昆明</p>
<p>第一批貨、於上月十八日裝法郵船斐列克洛塞爾號、運往西貢、二十五日抵貢、即於二十七日裝車運昆、聞昨日（十日）貨已到達昆明、第二批貨數百噸、於本月一日、裝法郵船霞飛將軍號運出、現已抵貢、日內即可裝車運昆、當在本月下句內亦可到昆、第三批貨、將於十五日裝法船社美號運去、故對於滬昆聯運、</p>
<p>可稱成功</p>
<p>叉悉中和·怡太兩運輸公司、亦聯合辦理滬昆飛快聯運、日內即將實行、</p>
<h3>絕對禁止　偽鈔滙款　等於代爲推行　應加嚴密防範</h3>
<p>財政部以「華興銀行」發行「鈔票」、業經一再飭知本市各業、嚴守立塲、一律拒用、並絕對停止津戶僞幣滙兌在案、近財部又據報告、有人主張華北以「聯準」鈔匯款、在滬以交「華興鈔」爲限、倘如此辦理、雖收付均爲偽鈔、但結果等於代爲推行、終成將爲侵入蘇州河以南之導綫、應予嚴密防範、特嚴申前令、絕對禁止在華北收緻「聯準鈔一匯滬交「華興鈔」之匯款、</p>
<h3>平洋浦附近　日輪觸礁　搭客十餘人　駁至沈家門</h3>
<p>海南輪船公司租僱之日輪揚子江、於上班由定海裝載客貨啟椗來滬、途經距定海二十里之平洋浦附近時、因潮流湍急、偶不經心、船身觸及該處水格壩碟石、其時適值退潮、且浪濤洶湧、致無法離礁、當由該輪船主、駕船將全船搭客共十餘人、駁載至沈家門鎮、一面乘晚間漲潮之際、將輪拖出礁石、仍行載客來滬、惟搭客已飽受虛驚、</p>

<h3>商店應收受　行用郵票　愼勿另購新郵票　致汚損郵票日多</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局、對流通市上作錢碼行用之的值四十萬元郵票、大致可望接受合法團體之建議、呈經上級、覓取解決途徑、至民衆方面、亦應注意勿使污損郵票之數量加多、據大通社記者在市塲上默察、頗有商店、以不願接受外間郵票、冀免遭受汚損損失、故寗願以法幣向郵局購買新郵票、爲尾找之用、如是、勢將使代巷錢碼郵票數量增多、亦即使汚損郵票增多、故殊爲不智、此等商店、深望能接受外間郵票、通融接受、蓋遲早政府終有解決辦法、不使民間遭受損失也、</p>

<p>滬甬綫自間接復航、並經當局核准、允許老弱婦孺搭輪進出後、滬鎭間各輪旅客、即呈擁擠狀况、而自甬來滬允爲衆多、每輪開滬時、搭客輒在千餘人至三千人以上、且多係預先在鎮海等候、一聞滬輪到達封鎖口外、即行紛粉自雇小舟、趕駁上輪、因人數業多、且均爭先恐後、致危險殊甚、據悉上月二十八晚、曾有旅客十餘人、合雇小船一艘、擬登德平輪、但駛行近封銷綫時、突與他輪相撞、致生意外、危及搭客安全、</p>
<p>謀福當局力策安全</p>
<p>本市禮和洋行謀福輪當局、為避免發生危險、以策旅客安全起見、故經決定所有船票、須先在公司購就後、方得乘坐該公司特備之駁船、轉駁登輪、絕對拒絕自行登輪、以免危險、關於行李方面、則在寗波鎭海分設有行李間及查騐處、一切辦法、均極週詳、並經印就「旅客須知」、於發售船票時、隨發各旅客、俾衆週知云、又據大光社記者探悉、謀福輪於九日下午返滬後、原定十二晨仍駛鎭、茲以留鎮外輪尚多、故已改期十五日淸晨四時啟椗、並委托奪波路七十七號大夾銀行代售客票、</p>

<h3>大房東的二房東的如意算盤</h3>
<p>— 三房客</p>
<p>外匯一縮再縮，以致法幣的對外價值，大大地减低了下去，洋貨價錢飛漲，國貨價錢來軋軋鬧猛，已經成了現在一般的現象。有幾處掛名「洋商」的大房東，看得眼紅，於是也來一個房租加價，其理由是說：外匯縮了，我們「外國人」所得减少，不能償所失，非加價不可。於是，加價的標凖，要照外匯計算，目前是再加三成四成，以後即以此爲例。租戶在這樣的情勢之下，其恐慌是可想而知的，因爲他們的收入並不照外匯計算，房租自然不能一加就是三四成。現在，正有這樣的許多租戶，在謀對付之策，我不免向他們貢獻一偭意見，以作參考：他們可以問問這些「洋商」大房東：假使法幣根本不能買外匯了（這是很可能的），或者說，外匯的黑市根本取消了（這是很應該的），他們，「洋商」大房東，將向租戶收些什麼？以什麼爲標準？</p>
<p>房子的租戶當然最怕大房東加房租。然而在這些租戶中，有所謂一房東者，却不但不怕大房東加房租，反而歡迎之不暇。我家的二房東，一接到大房東加房租四成的通知書，便喜逐顏開的來通知我，說：『四成未免太多些，多少總要加些的。哈哈，羊毛出在羊身上，對不起，哈哈，羊毛出在羊身上。』榮幸得很，一般三房客居然承二房東看得起，足以忝居「少牢」之職。於是，大房東只要一僩四成，二房東却藉此收到了四個五個四成，蓋每一個現代二房東，總是豢養着有毛可剪的羊四五頭，足以供給他的吃著不盡也。至於將來時世太平後，羊，身上的毛剪得像醜小鴨一樣的羊，一個個跑了之後，大房東的四成依然如故，只有自己獨自領敎，他們，這些二房東，似乎並沒有想到。</p>
<p>掛上些燈籠，豈不好看？</p>

<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外監聞忽迎柳葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>且說何家姊妹，接到了她們父親的電報，說是奉了國際貿易委員會的命令，要敎他到新疆去。本來原是說到了北平，預備就要東三省去的，此刻要派他到新疆去，恐怕東三名去是暫綏了。因爲他是經理國際貿易的輸出入的，忽然之問，要到新疆去，那就是在輸出入上很有關係的了。原來這時甘肅到新疆的公路，已經通了好久，國內貿易，日漸發達。而廿肅到新疆的那一條鐵路，不久也可以全路通車。但是高級機關人員的往來，還是乘飛機。這一回，何先生從北平到新疆去，當然也是坐的飛機了。新疆這一塊地方，名爲中國的一省，實在併合中國的本部——八省，也比它大不了許多。自從——餘年前，中日戰爭的時代，便有人跑到新疆去開發。以後絡絡續續去的人，一年比一年加多，也就　年比一年繁盛了。這們一塊土地，因爲　在中心裹，四圍環繞，交通不便，大家都不想去開發。不知氣候溫和，物產豐饒，礦物，動物，植物，什麼東西沒有？正是一片大好膏腴之地。單是羊毛的出產，可以每年供給全世界而有餘。此番何先生到新疆去，恐怕也是爲着羊毛出口的問題吧？雖然父親在新疆躭擱不久，至多也不過兩三個月，但父親旣然敎她們打電報通知在廣州的母親和弟弟，她們自然立刻打電報回去。依着兩位小姐的意思，也想把她們的繼母和兩位弟弟，接到上海來游玩幾天。一來，爲着兩位弟弟的讀書，不可荒嬉了；二則自己這個別墅也還不曾造好，此刻到上海來，徒多糜費，上海這個地方，直到如今，還是個銷金之窟。兩位小姐的意思，預備把自由村那個別墅，早些兒建築成了，禀明父親，和繼母商量定妥了，索性永久住居到這裹來。兩位弟弟，便敎他們到自由村小學校去讀書。因爲兩位小姐，知道她們這兩位弟弟，不免有些嬌生慣養，脫不了貴族習氣。不用說兩位小弟弟了，她們自己，也是兩位嬌貴小姐。可是在道個時代，不能冉如此了。她們知道自由村小學校，都是鄉下人家的兒童，耐苦習勤慣了的，她們願意她們的弟弟，也養成這種動樸之風。（一六九）</p>
<h3>學生消費已高　書籍文具又漲　採用舊書減輕担負</h3>
<p>— 一粟</p>
<p>本市各書局發行之中小學敎科書，近因外匯冉度緊縮，物價上漲，一致公決中學敎科書照定價加五成，小學敎科書照定價加八成發售，自七月甘六日起實行。這樣一來，學生們的負担又加重了。</p>
<p>爲明瞭詳細情形起見，乘便訪問一爿書店的老闆，他與作者有些親戚關係，所以告訴出的事情，比較至誠。</p>
<p>開始我的問語：「現在敎科書已漲價，存的書可多賺些錢了！」</p>
<p>他很直爽的回答：「代售性質的書店，不會有好多存貨的，目前存的書總有些好處。講起書店的利息是很薄的，不過開支而已。此决漲價，除小學敎科書漲八成，中學敎科書漲五成外，非敎科書平均漲三四成。總之，煞門書（需用多者）比較漲得多；冷門書（需用較少者）漲得少些。至於文具用品大都也漲三四成不等。原版西書當然依外匯走，好在早有影印西書補救；可是現也漲三成了。」</p>
<p>目前一切物價飛漲，單是學生個人生活的消費已是很高，現加上書籍文具的漲價，一個學生的家長將何以負担。所以，在可能範圍內，不妨多化費一些時間，上舊書攤去找找自己所需要的書，是可以佔不少便宜。下面是作者向那位書店老闆討敎到的上海舊書攤情形，作為選購舊書的參考</p>
<p>戰後上海舊書攤也和其他新興事業一樣，如雨後春筍那般設立着。卡德路愛文義路一帶，可說是舊書的集中點，總共的有十幾處，出售原版西書，影印西書和高初中敎科書，種數很多。此外大都設在河南路，叫馬路，辣斐德路，貝勒路附近。其中河南路靠近商務印書館的一家舊書店，規模較大，各色書籍比較齊備。同路救火會對面有一處，設備雖簡陋，但英文文學一類書籍，和西文雜誌很多。四馬路上的舊書攤，中國國學書籍和中小學敎科書佔多數。辣斐德路上的，高中用書頗多，普通工程用書也有。至於還有好多舊書攤，非常簡單，是臨時設攤的，偶然也有很好的書本見到。</p>
<p>暑期轉瞬將過，在開學的時候，希望去試試罷。</p>
<h3>「新金山」</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Captain　Fury”</p>
<p>看完了新金山」，確是使人聯想起「羅賓漢」來。一個是目睹敎王弄政，殘殺平民，因而匿身綠林，聯合羣衆，起而反抗，爲皇室效忠；一個是受了大地主的壓迫，援救了同伴，出沒於山叢之間，專事鋤强扶弱，刦富濟貧之舉，等到他們唯一的對象擊倒之後，也就受了總督的招撫。不過，他們反抗，爭鬥，不屈不撓的精神，是值得我們學習的，這些草莽英雄在歷史上留着可寶貴的一頁，就是他們反抗，爭鬥，不屈不撓的精神！</p>
<p>「新余山」的搆成，果然是寫這位傑出的英雄飛來將軍，但是劇作者並不强調這一人物的出現，而以羣衆的力量，及他們的嚴密組織（如以白旗爲號）來陪襯他們和大地主的尖銳爭鬥，終於獲得成功，這是可取的。同時，他更告訴我妥恊的必然失敗，向大地主告密的杜波里，非但沒有獲得重賞，反而被禁在牢內，這是一個可寶貴的敎訓！</p>
<p>導演者海爾魯契處理這個戲的手腕非常高强。大地主的貪婪兇狠，爪牙的助紂爲虐，及飛來的反抗，每一塲戲都刺激，跳動；而尖銳爭鬥的展開，也固强有力。舉幾個例來說：那些上了鐵鐐的罪犯，拖着沉重的步伐，列隊走路時，他以鐵面無私，上了槍刺的衛隊來對比。敲去鐵鐐時，一個脚踝上傷痕的特寫。這有力的描寫，正是加强奴隸們反抗的刺激。茀雷和勃萊奇打架以後，是茀雷的代爲受過，惟被侮辱和被損害者的聯合起來，不但感動，而且加强了結合的可貴。兩决大地主爪牙收括民衆土地，財產時，把兇狠毒辣和爲民除虐，鮮明的剖割開來，如馬隊來時的威風，及山巔上的烽火爲號，而空氣氣氛，也非常緊張。</p>
<p>更可愛的是他探刻地勾劃了勃萊奇這人物，從出塲至終場，都可愛之至。</p>
<p>一場跳舞會，也處理得活潑，熱鬧。</p>
<p>演茀雷的是白拉恩亞亨，體格不够高大，戲却很沉着。演得最好的當然是維克多麥克勞倫（勃萊奇），率直，粗魯，熱情，可愛，他的一舉一動，都活生生地刻劃這樣一個人物的性格，和「海上煉獄」及「鐵漢末路」比起來，簡直是判然兩人。瓊蘭的珍妮，出塲不多。演大地主托里斯的喬治柴哥，也很好，那種貪得無厭，殘忍兇狠的樣子，非常逼眞。</p>
<p>在這偭暑期中各戲院所公映的影片，「新金山」該是最優秀的一部了。</p>
<h3>靈魂到底有無？（二續）</h3>
<p>— 竺</p>
<p>（3）人有宗教細想！宗教思想乃是人類獨有的天性；任何高等動物都沒有的，因為牠們沒有靈魂的。惟有人類無論文明，野蠻，智慧，愚魯，都有宗敎思想，知道在人之上尙有神道存在，應當敬畏崇拜。也知道人死後尙有靈魂存在，所以祭祀他們的祖先。雖然他們認錯了神，以人造的假神，當作眞神，（這是因為不明眞道，情有可原。）但是足可以表明他們心靈中都知道有神的，也知道人死後靈魂仍在。（４）人類都有天良的！各種動物不可以理喻，因為牠們沒靈魂，沒有天良的。人類雖然有個性不同，環境不同，風俗習慣不同。但是天良則同，「是非之心，人皆有之。」這次抗戰會世界人都與我國表同情，此可證明公理（天良）自在人心。再就個人方面來講，作了善事，心中平安快樂，作了惡事，受天良責備，心市常存恐懼害怕。這天良好像上敵置於人之心中的一只錶，正如水電公司置水錶電錶一般。將來人到不帝面前去受審判，上帝只要一看我們天良，就知道你一生所作之事了。所以人在上帝面前不能詭辯推諉的。有人常說，我憑良心做人，不信什麼重教。不過到了審判之日，良心反作了你的原告，因為世上沒有一人，自幼從未作過虧心的事，良心只能盡牠本份作忠實的見證，這樣適足以定你的罪。為此我們要趁早向上帝悔改，求牠赦免人們的過犯，並信仰上底的兒子耶穌基督做你中保，上帝因耶穌替你死，　你罪的功勞，就赦免你一切罪愆。這樣你心中頓起變化，好像債還淸，又　担脫身，就可得到眞正的平安和喜樂（未完）　基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>陳雲裳小姐談：經歷與希望（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>編者介紹：陳雲裳來目南國，蜚聲涊燸；「木蘭從軍」片初顯身手，一鳴驚人；才藝出衆，洵非倖致。電影界頻年爲才難興嘆，新人造就絕少；而雲裳竟能照耀銀壇，泃屬難能可貴，有足令人爭爲刮目者矣</p>
<h3>藝人漫記</h3>
<p>我是一位南國小女兒，從離去故鄕，來到上海電影界後，片子雖只拍過兩部，在影塲工作方面，却已增長了不少知識；這樣給我一個較好的奮進機會，我眞感到非常的欣慰。</p>
<p>學歷本職</p>
<p>回想從業電影的經歷：自十六歲那年起，算來已有四個年頭了。以前的學程：十一歲小學畢業，隨轉廣州女子師範疑業兩年。當時，父親爲職務關係，一度移家汕頭，我即因而中途輟學。後來遷回省城居住，（廣州）自己就在當地民衆敎育館担任導師職務——是幼稚院那樣訓導許多小孩子唱歌，體操等事。直經兩年以上，才到香港去投進銀色的圈子。</p>
<p>家庭的概况</p>
<p>我家庭的情况很簡單，父親向在政界服務，母親就只生我們姊妹兩人。我的學名呌民强，妹妹名治强，今年也有十六歲了。童年時期，我最愛好的事便是學習歌舞。故外交次長朱兆莘先生有位媳婦，和我們是鄰居；她是英國人，因爲很歡喜我，在我十歲那年便開始敎我舞蹈；唱歌則在學校裏學起的。彼時，學校裏或社會方面，凡遇舉行游藝盛會，我就常以小孩子的姿態參加歌舞表演。有些刊物上說我怎樣出身於舞班中。此類傳言是絕對不確的。</p>

<p>中國首部古裝聲片「貂蟬」的攝製，他是飾演三國的一代奸雄董卓，公映後的成績也就奠定了他在銀壇上的成功。</p>
<p>我們還記得往年杭州六和塔下的三對藝人集團結婚，顧而己和杜小鵑便是其中的一對，他倆在結婚後，生了兩個孩子。</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生，顧而己和杜小鵑便隨同業餘　團赴內地從事演劇工作。後來，業餘劇團無形解散，而顧而己也便加入「中電」爲演員，先後演過「孤城喋血」「中華兒女」「長空萬里一等片，並參加重慶影劇人的話劇演出。</p>
<p>最近，日機不斷炸渝，在有一决的轟炸中，他的家是被燒了。除把兩個孩子搶救出來之外，衣服雜件，全都化了灰燼。</p>
<p>眞的，一禍不單行」這句話竟在他身上應騐了，他爲了躱避警報，於是就搬到南岸去住。那裹知道他的夫人杜小鵑又會生起病來呢？她是祇息了四小時的霍亂症而就與世長辭。留下的却什麼都沒有了，朝夕相伴的是兩個不解人事的小孩，他現在是家破人亡了。這情境別說他自己感到深切的悲痛，就是旁人看了也不能不爲他一掬同情之淚呢！</p>
<p>回想在三四年前，他還是一個獨身的光棍，現在，枝葉才有些豐滿，却想不到他這樣受到如此底橫暴的摧殘。</p>
<p>本來，他決定和趙丹王爲一夫婦等赴新疆迪化，開展戲劇工作的，現在，因爲兩個孩子乏人照料和自己內心的哀痛，也就中止此行了。他底哀痛裏會長出更大的憤怒，我相信，不久，他終會毅然決然重新担負起偉大的責任來的。</p>

<h3>舞國佳話獻給彈性兒女</h3>
<p>— 鳳翔</p>
<p>疲足還原法·一刻鐘奏效</p>
<p>跳舞這門玩意兒，看來輕鬆得很，毫不費力；但在時間跳得過久，足部每易感到疲乏，正如挑輕擔走遠路的人一樣，會體念到「百步無輕擔」俗語的不虛。</p>
<p>這里錄下一個好萊塢女星潑麗絲西拉，藍（Priscilla　lane）所創的「疲足還原法」以獻予舞國的彈性兒女。</p>
<p>藍小姐所指導的方法，是先要預備好兩盆水，其中一盆的水要很熱，另一盆水要很冷；初把足伸入很熱的水盆中，再很快的換伸到很冷的水盆中，一會兒又提出拭乾，搽上杏仁油（Almond　Oil）並按摩之，更須灑些花露水或抹些爽身粉，然後把足部自然地平放，在柔軟的墊子上，稍停幾分鐘，就可了事，這時你便能覺得疲勞已霍然離去，而計算所費的時間，從開始到終止，奏效之速，尚不出一刻鐘。</p>
<p>最後，還得記住，當你再要繼續起舞的時候，不耍去穿上方才脫下的襪子和皮鞋。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>長腿將軍堂會懸匾與劈匾忙</p>
<p>陳雪（調元）這人雖有個陳傻子的外號。可是他不但不傻。而且比誰都精明强幹。他因爲深知道「大智若愚」這句話的秘訣。所以他自從民國二年任七十四旅旅長駐防徐州起。直到現在止。一共沒有失掉軍政顯要的地位。其問由旅長而升任徐州鎭守使。旋以孫美瑤臨城刧車案。辦理有功。未幾即升皖督。北伐後復任總指揮，安微主席。以及今日之軍事參議院院長等職。民國二十八年。簡直就幹了兩個十四年的闊差使。北洋軍閥除閻百川外不曉得被他熬倒多少人（北方土語中的個熬字。用得甚妙。俗云「點燈熬油」（人快死了熬時候」又如「二進宮戲詞「十年寒窗。九載熬汕。」及「探親」之一多年大路變成河。新娶媳婦熬成婆。」這些熬字都用得非常恰當。因爲凡事物之慢慢消耗於無形中者。都用「熬字來形容一下。這比用上多少字的還有意義。戲詞與方言有關。故土語中亦往往有絕妙之修辭學也。）古今的人能走十年大運的。已經很不多觀。何况他業已走了三十年紅運而現在仍居顯職的呢。他這人不但我曾見過而且他的公子中尚有一位是我的矮足。故而我對於他的爲人。也知之頗稔。他不惟有膽有識。同時遇着有關國家大局的事兒。也能拿得起。放得下。當機立斷。翻臉不認人。昔日臨城抱犢　的那回事。他只帶着上海某老頭子的一封信。就單人獨騎闖進崮內。這種勇氣簡直同黃天覇進連環套時同樣的危險而使人昨舌的了。——（七九）——</p>

<p>飾金掛四百四十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百二十元、迨至九時三十五分、掛高十元、逾刻許又大五元、十時再掛高五元、十時半回小五元、十二時許復高五元、此後無變化、結果掛高二十元、計大同行改懸四百四十元、新同行爲四百三十八元收進的减低二十元餘、</p>
<p>英純金突縮半辦士</p>
<p>九日倫教電、英純金每盎斯突縮半辦士、計退達七鎊八先令六辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦降低至一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準金價亦隨跌三角、計一千二百〇七元六角、</p>
<h3>外滙不惜貴價收買　匯豐掛牌又改縮　美金曾進七元關</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌揭曉、英金猛縮二五、美滙亦暴跌半元、均已打破本月八日三辦士七五、與七元三一二五之最低價、又創見英金三辦士半、美滙六元八一二五之空前新紀錄、其他亦莫不慘落、英美滙暗市、新緊價亦層出不　、初開照隔昨午收價不動、顧外行賣意殊淡、故此時實爲有行無市、嗣因日行正金與華僑銀行及洋行等不惜貴價吸收、加以英行滙豐賣意甚淡、而吃胃頗佳、致雖有華銀行等前來塞出、但仍感杯水車薪、難退勢燄、致情勢遂步緊不已、英金竟創見三辦士五六二五，美滙六元九三七五之空前新緊價、將近午刻、西商沙遜復來拋售、兼棉紗帮多頭亦來出籠、故午收遂略回硬、午後因華商與某華銀行續來活動、是以爲狀復稍轉軟、結果英又緊一五六二五、美亦續軟三一二五、而本月期貨亦趨同一步驟、終則以英金三辦士半、美滙六元八一二五收盤、全天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>沙遜乘高則有回出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期未史、遠期回縮〇六二五、紐的銀價未定、倫敦生金突降半辦士、滙兌英對美·對法均平、對滬小一二五、美對英·對法俱無上落、對滬跌一角五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七五、美滙七元三一二五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後因外行賣意殊淡、致市勢即見步軟、首由華商結進某行本月份美滙七元後、日行正金與進口洋行及華僑銀行等相繼結進華行與某美行現貨英金由三辦士六八七五、縮至五六二五、並現貨美滙由七元一二五緊至六元九三七五、迨滙豐掛脾揭曉、英滙縮二五、美滙跌半元、其他亦一致降落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免微、此後西商沙遜突來趁貴吐出、且出口商亦稍來拋售、是以形勢略定、計沙遜塞予滙豐·有利現貨英金三辦士六二士、繼而出口商吐予有利現貨美滙七元〇六二五、後華義吃進同行現貨美滙七元〇六二五、時日行復來扒結、加以港方投機商亦來電購結、故情勢復趨軟化、計日行與港電相繼吸納華比某等行現貨英金三辦士五九三七五、並現貨美滙七元及六元九三七五、將近午刻、棉紗帮多頭突來出籠、加以沙　賣意復萌、且日行已無納胃、致市勢重見回硬、計棉紗帮與沙遜相繼吐予有利等外行現貨英金三辦士六二五、並現貨美滙七元、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價英金三辦士六二五、美滙七元〇六二五、本月份英金三辦士五三一二五、美滙六元八七五、</p>
<p>美匯收盤回至七元</p>
<p>後市祿開頗定、首中某行吸進同行本月份美滙六元八七五、迨至二時半光景、某華行突來扒結、兼華商亦來吸收現期美滙、是以爲狀略緊、計華行結進大通某行現貨美滙七元、並購結外行現貨英金三辦士五九三七五、繼華商結進某行現貨美滙七元、及本月份美滙六元八一二五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士五九三七五、美滙七元、本月份英金三辦士半、美滙六元八一二五、結果比上日、現期英金均又緊一五六五、美滙亦均再縮三一二五、</p>

<h3>外幣頻漲　英金鎊一〇三元　美元一〇六元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外滙軟弱、烚赤上漲猛劇、英美金鎊上升亦銳、英美金票需要甚殷、市况挺秀、香港票·法郞票·俱趨激昂、新加坡票·荷蘭票等、一致猛升、日金票平庸、晚市爲一元零九分、朝鮮票未更、晚市爲九角一分五厲、公會交易甚稀、祥康出仁泰進德金票二百個、鴻昌出祥康進香港票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊升五元、英金票升三元七角、美金鎊升四元五角、美金票升五角九分、香港票升二角一分、法郞票升二分五厘、新加坡票荷蘭票俱升五角、安南票升一角五分、羅比票升三角、坎拿大票升一元、斐律濱票升四角、義大利票升五分、德金票升二角、澳金票升三元、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現欲高又止</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、每千元仍堅盤於二百元關外呈先高後平、上午初開在二百〇五元左右、嗣因現鈔用途突廣、頓見步高達二百十八元、近午始見回退至二百十元、下午不支、最後爲二百〇五元、與前日價相同、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍開一角八分未更云、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機之第二自標　囤進棉紗　雙馬再抬三十二元　連漲四天達百廿元</h3>
<p>紗市漲風尖銳、市場上一般驚惶失措之象、不堪言狀、大有購置棉紗、皆可發財、此種虛慌之象、據談全係一般殷富人士、及金融界一律紛紛出動、且不顧一切、乃造成恐怖局面、查近來外匯固縮、然二十支雙馬棉紗一牌、自上週末至今共計四天、直綫飛騰一百二十元、設與外滙比例、紗價亦抬過頭、至於廣帮實需雖不斷絕、據一方面言、該莊客含投機性質之採買、佔百分之五十以上、就棉紗本身上着想、决不有如此之風在濫漲、如此情形、非紗業之福也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開尙平、因上日升漲殊巨、大家觀望、故二十支雙馬門票貨開價爲六百八十八元、棧單價爲六百三十九元、少頃氣勢轉升、且流言復盛、步步前進、謂外匯又縮、投機買風一閧而來、市價一跳十元、再跳二十元、棧單之漲風可畏、買者一味濫拖、不論價值已達最高峯、外棧價爲七百二十二元、棧單爲六百九十元、棧單與開盤價根跳五十一元之巨查半日成交統計一千三百八十包、又上日午後成交一百五十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三十二元、特金城漲十元、雙地球漲三十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3>美種通花　漲到一百卅元</h3>
<p>中外棉花交易又見進展、一　　商新裕廠大量採辦、計一七百五十件、二十支　料佔多數、其餘同業中互相買賣、異常活　　亦進一千三四百件、火機花已售到一百十三元（鈔票）、通州美種花已售到一百三十元亦係（鈔票）、查各花市價再漲五元至八元之　、惟英廠未見動辦、新辦之廠亦無動靜、因其紗價售盤較低、照棉市採算、廠方無利可圖、或者不出於减工一法也、蘇北來源稍見增加、計通州花三百〇五包、又北河來二百三十件、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>

<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、因匯兌之日形緊縮、原棉售價飛騰、昨平果兒新特已有一百十元之成交、價格可供紡三十二支之美棉、昨日成交爲一百八十元、日來雖售價日高、然其中暗礁尚多、將來紗廠减工消息證實、或日廠前定之貨湧到、則棉價將猛跌、此乃不可不防者也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初開盤即呈堅定之狀、投機者在市頗爲活躍、利物浦及孟買來電告漲、人心因之更爲振作、其　棉區氣候報轉爲惡劣、直至收盤市價漲七八磅昔、印度連同預測漲七五羅比、埃及跌二十磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　投機之第三目標　操縱民食　到源雖有米價難平　一般生活更見嚴重</h3>
<p>上海民食、更見緊張之狀、雖昨日河下續到松江帮十五艘、車輪包子一千餘包、米商猶在散布空氣、謂松江後批尚有二十餘儎可來、但自此一批續到後、有該區陳糙已罄之說、此說是吾可信、尚待事實證明、因米商目前正利用種種說素、以爲米價昂貴漲作掩飾耳、昨日市塲交易仍僅變元開二十六元、洋糯二十四元半、至二十四元、冬霜二十四元半、此不受限價之貨、市外交易聞已轉遜、高梗及高薄稻傳聞仍開二十六元、河下貨開二十四元半至二十五元、高尖二十二元、决尖二十元、砶尖十八元、照前市暗盤而論、堪稱定局、至浦東新粳見到糙粳一二十擔、由滬廠碾白出售、聞在市外做開二十三元、統計市內外成交數的共五千餘擔、尚不爲少、惟出價非廿六元不能得好米、願照限價買米、亦有回絕、即有買得、細碎不堪、渾說三號米、不知爲何種米也、現下少數有資力有可儲藏者、固已貯有足量之米、但大多數無擔石之糧者、無不感覺嚴重困難、人心惶惶、後果不知如何也、</p>
<p>客莊暗市交易、亦趨寥落、蓋因一部店戶對此逾限交易頗具戒心、大都趦趄不前、且日前一部進限購進之貨、門市脫手尚感困難、是以購戶淸稀、市勢頓告稍挫、惟貨方則仍欲堅持不肯輕脫、致結果較前市僅微疲二三角、統市成交的一千包左右、南京特尖價爲二十一元二角、</p>
<p>洋米依然緊持不出、市一仍乏做開、至於定貨上節、聞因外匯問題、無相當辦法也、</p>
<h3>投機之第四目標　收買粉麥</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨二號粉廠盤、又漲一角、改爲五元六角現鈔、且各廠對於大票交易、一概暫停供給、祇能應酬本街日常零批、每家亦以數十包爲限、聞回籠貨售棧單者反比廠盤爲俏、因有業外囤戶在市吸收、洋粉以外滙一再緊縮、售價竟須五元八角現鈔、</p>
<p>小肇　昨日來源絡繹、新到之貨不願輕脫、良以外滙奇緊、粉價步高、人心更好、昨華廠與日廠互有吸收、囤戶收買允勁、致市面又升一二角之譜、統市售開管店·沙河集·丹陽·烏衣·浦口·蘇州·無錫·揚州·南京等麥共達四十餘車、計由囤戶購辦二十車餘、其餘悉爲福阜兩廠收、最高價爲八元四角三分、</p>
<h3>證劵　統甲大跌　四元相近</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤昨日市况、甲種舉行抽籤、此次共抽一十五支之多、故甲種市價應按除中籤計算、照向例中籤權利不過一元左右、但甲種開價即做五十元、做小二元三角半、利用無管束之地點、爲所欲爲、新聞宜傳肆其鼓簧、昨日開盤、甲種除中籤計算、空方認爲惟一之弱點、故開價即在跌二元三角半、以五十元開盤、第二行市再跌七角、恐怖局面即行造成、此後陸續壓小、再跌元許、其餘各債乃亦隨之而跌、但甚少超過一元者、買賣雙方之代理者、因多數不合常軌、多向讀者報告徒亂人意、市價結果又小一元左右、獨甲種除中籤小三元九角半、成交數的四十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤比前日</p>
<p>統甲五〇·〇四八·四〇　四八·〇跌三九五</p>
<p>統乙四一·八〇四一·　〇　四一·五〇跌一·〇五</p>

<p>統戊三九·三五　九·〇〇　三九·〇〇跌〇·九五</p>

<h3>Hunan Army Forces Enemy to the Outskirts of Yueyang; Japanese Troops in Shanxi Province Surrounded in the Mountains with No Hope of Breakthrough; Situation Tense Again Regarding Japanese Warship Activity Near Zhongshan</h3>
<p>The Chinese army in northern Hunan near Changde has been advancing continuously in recent days. In addition to certain units bypassing Yueyang to the rear and constantly harassing the Japanese, a certain army on the front has also advanced to the outskirts of Yueyang. Currently, all four suburbs of Yueyang are areas of activity for regular Chinese troops and guerrillas. The Japanese are in extreme panic. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Zhaoqing, Shunde, and Xinhui are being transferred frequently, spying on Zhongshan. On the 8th, two Japanese warships and three motorboats arrived at the Yinggezui River and opened fire, fiercely bombarding Meili and Nantou. Chinese defense teams held their positions firmly, and the Japanese have so far failed to gain any advantage. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>On the evening of the 6th, Chinese troops attacked the Japanese troops in Jingmingpu (northwest of Lishan). On the 7th, together with Chinese troops attacking from the Lishan area from the north, they killed more than 40 Japanese soldiers in the Shangshidian area, capturing many spoils of war. The key passes in the Lishan area have been completely recovered by the Chinese army. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese troops that had infiltrated northern Hubei from the Suixian area to the northwest, due to the fierce attacks by the Chinese army from the south, northwest, and north, suffered heavy casualties. They began a general retreat to the southeast on the night of the 8th of this month. It is reported that the fighting in southern Shanxi is currently taking place south of Qinshui, with the battle line extending to the southeast of Yicheng, as the Japanese troops attempt to clear the Chinese troops on the highway between Qinshui and Yicheng. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to well-informed Chinese sources today, the strategy adopted in Shanxi Province of evacuating all residents and food from areas threatened by Japanese troops has been quite effective for two years. In the future, China may adopt the same strategy in all theaters. Once it is certain that the Japanese troops intend to attack a certain town, the residents there will retreat with the troops to the center, all food will be moved away, and water sources will be cut off. When the Japanese troops run out of supplies and are forced to retreat, the Chinese army will ambush them along the way. A Soviet military visitor recently returned from the battlefield in Jiangxi Province and stated today that during his two months in Gaoan, he only saw one old woman in a town on the southwest highway of Nanchang. It is reported that Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi recently highly praised the achievement of the commander of the Chinese army in Shanxi Province in creating close cooperation between the military and the people at a meeting of the Chinese General Staff, and advocated that the commanders of the Chinese army in all theaters should follow the example of Shanxi Province in organizing the people to implement the new strategy that has achieved remarkable results in Shanxi Province. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the spokesman of the Military Affairs Commission, the Chinese army, with the help of wind and rain, completely defeated the Japanese attack in Shanxi Province in July.

On the morning of the 2nd, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched an attack on Xishuiba (north of Lishi) and immediately stormed and occupied the outer trenches of Xishuiba, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese troops. At 3:00 PM on the 4th, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched an attack on Daheng Mountain (northwest of Lishi) and engaged in fierce fighting with more than 300 Japanese troops in that area. After several hours, the Chinese army completely occupied Daheng Mountain. The Japanese troops made several counterattacks, but after the Chinese army bravely charged and killed, they ultimately failed to succeed. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Because the Japanese army has invaded Dieshi again, fighting has broken out again in the Zhongshan area, and the situation is tense. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese guerrilla teams in Zhaoqing have been sweeping the Xinhui area and have repeatedly achieved victories. In order to prevent night attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese army has increased the number of tanks patrolling the Jiangmen Fozi'ao area, but they have repeatedly been ambushed by the Chinese army, and their situation is extremely panicked. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) After the Chinese army destroyed the Bian-Tong Highway the night before last, they immediately attacked the Japanese troops in Chichang, which is located in this area (south of Kaifeng) and has more than 200 Japanese infantry and five artillery pieces. After the Chinese army repeatedly charged and killed, they broke into the Japanese positions, fought bravely in close combat, killing more than 60 Japanese soldiers. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army attacked the South Gate of Kaifeng, completely destroying the Japanese intelligence department. The Japanese troops fled in panic and were killed by the Chinese army, twenty more. When the Japanese troops in the city sent reinforcements, the Chinese army had safely moved to a certain area. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who invaded northern Hubei near Fancheng, after being heavily ambushed by various routes of the Chinese army, collapsed and retreated one after another. A unit of more than 1,000 is now retreating to Leiguyu, Tamiwan, Wanjadian, and the 1080 high ground Duzong Mountain and other places in the southwest suburbs of Suixian, stubbornly resisting. In addition to restoring the original positions, the Chinese army is still pressing and encircling the Japanese troops in Suixian. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The more than 600 Japanese troops stationed in Anju, near Fancheng, after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese army for four hours at 2:00 PM on the 5th, suffered more than 200 Japanese casualties and were unable to resist. They retreated to Junchuan Shop, Dingjia River near Suixian. Anju has been recovered. On the same day, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops in Liangou, Gaocheng, Qigudian, and other places near Lishan, and the fighting was fierce. Later, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the flank, and the Japanese army completely wavered, with both sides attacking. The Japanese army abandoned corpses everywhere and collapsed to the south. The Chinese army is currently pursuing fiercely. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Xikang Inspection Team Drafting Report</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Sichuan-Xikang Construction Inspection Team, led by Li Huang, Huang Yanpei, Chu Fucheng, Mo Dehui, Gao Xibing, and Zhang Lan, set out from Chongqing in March and went to southern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, northern Sichuan, and Xikang to investigate the administration, military service, public security, people's livelihood, and economic construction. The inspection was completed in mid-month, and they have returned to Chongqing one after another. Although this trip was full of dangers and hardships, because they visited all parts of Sichuan and Xikang and collected a wealth of material, it is a major contribution to the future construction of Sichuan and Xikang. They are currently waiting for all the team members to form groups to draft reports, which will be submitted to the Sichuan-Xikang Construction Preparatory Committee to be convened next week for discussion, and will immediately formulate a plan for the construction of Sichuan and Xikang, which will be submitted to the National Senate for review and then sent to the government for adoption and implementation.

<h3>English "Chu Pao" Engages in Written Battle with German Reporter</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The English "Chu Pao" recently published an editorial mentioning "rogue states." Hinke, the visiting correspondent stationed in Chongqing of the German Intelligence Agency, sent a letter to the newspaper yesterday, refuting the editorial. The editor of "Chu Pao" also replied, retorting with sarcasm. It is not uncommon for Chinese and German figures to exchange opinions in an extremely frank manner. Hinke's letter to "Chu Pao" stated that the strongest group of nations in the world, Germany and Italy, would never pay attention to rogue newspapers barking, etc. "Chu Pao" replied, "The reporter in this article did not mention Germany and Italy. Why does the letter believe that rogue states must belong to Germany and Italy? Why is the letter so suspicious, or is it self-aware? We ask this question not to say that the conclusion of the letter is wrong; in fact, it may be very true. We believe that the sender must at least have ordinary knowledge. It is very interesting for the sender to call Germany and Italy the strongest group of nations in the world. This statement may or may not be true. Only time can tell whether it is true or not. If the sender does not forget history, he will know that the Triple Alliance in 1914 was indeed the most formidable group of nations at the time. However, as the war drew to a close, it proved that this group was not as formidable as most people initially believed. Germany and Italy have concluded a military alliance in addition to the Anti-Comintern Pact. Whether they have become the most formidable group of nations in the world today depends on whether Italy will not change its mind as it did during the last war. Of course, history may not repeat itself, but it may not repeat the old events. We sincerely hope that a second world war will never break out. However, before the future second great war is over, no one should be too optimistic about the formidability of the group formed by his country and other countries." The exchange of these letters is of particular interest because Mr. Hinke is the representative of the German official news agency stationed in Chongqing, and "Chu Pao" is generally believed to be closely related to the Chinese officialdom.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of Chamberlain's Policy</h3>
<p>This newspaper published a dispatch from the London correspondent yesterday, describing Chamberlain's foreign policy. Based on various viewpoints, it summarized several profound conclusions. The information listed therein was mostly disseminated by overseas dispatches in the past but not in detail. We believe that readers who read newspapers carefully will be able to gain something from this correspondence.</p>
<p>There are three noteworthy points in the correspondence: (1) Chamberlain's policy is not sufficient to represent the ideas of the British government and people. Only because Chamberlain is in power today, although those who oppose it have modified it, Britain's recent actions are still based on Chamberlain's policy. (2) Chamberlain's policy is to make as many concessions as possible to Germany and Japan, and Chamberlain is not reluctant to sacrifice gold pounds to bribe Germany, and he is even more generous in sacrificing the interests of others and preparing to abandon China, the Soviet Union, Africa, and South America. (3) Those who oppose Chamberlain's policy are not only the opposition parties in Britain, but also clear-headed conservatives are working hard to restrain it. Not only the countries that are prepared to be abandoned by Chamberlain's policy and those that have already been sacrificed, but also the United States does not want to see Chamberlain's policy misleading himself and others. As far as Germany is concerned, it knows that there are immediate benefits to being courted by Chamberlain, but it has other long-term considerations, so it is not willing to fall into his trap. Therefore, due to various oppositions, it is asserted that Chamberlain's policy will backfire and ultimately fail. The points pointed out in this correspondence are all based on evidence and are not mere speculation or malicious misinterpretation. I still remember that in late last month, when the preliminary agreement of the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks had not yet been established, this newspaper said that "Britain's international policy has always been untrustworthy to the world. Therefore, in recent years, in the midst of wind and rain, there are many who encourage Britain in the world, but very few who rely on Britain." Now, as evidenced by the description in the correspondence, we know that the previous argument was not wrong.</p>
<p>However, the shape of Chamberlain's policy is like a polyhedron. A planar observation is not enough to describe its true appearance, and even a few observations are difficult to see its full picture. The correspondence published yesterday made several observations, so the portrayal of the outline of Chamberlain's policy is valuable. However, in the promotion of the policy, the unexpected encounters and the endless evolution of reactions will change the center of gravity of the policy's movement and the shape and direction of its development at any time, making the harvest of the policy different from what it expected, or even the opposite. Chamberlain is said to have a strong personality and tenacity. He is persistent in dealing with affairs. He does not have the great talent to adapt to changes, but his old-fashioned calculations are enough to cover up his shortcomings. He has the courage to try difficult things, but he does not have the courage to ignore encounters and reactions, so he will not act perversely. Simon, who assists him, is gloomy and narrow-minded, and has become Chamberlain's dark shadow. The umbrella that he never leaves is like Chamberlain's compromise and appeasement that he is unwilling to give up, although it can be opened and closed, it is not enough to resist the wind and rain. This person and thing are actually the symbols of Chamberlain's personality and politics. This is what Chamberlain has reflected in our eyes and hearts in the past two years, and it is also the impression we have gained of Chamberlain in the past two years. Only because of this, Chamberlain's policy has its original appearance, as the correspondence published yesterday said, but it still changes according to encounters and reactions. It is indeed inevitable that he will be criticized by historians, but at this time, it cannot be said that Chamberlain's policy has no future!</p>
<p>If Chamberlain and the original appearance of his policy are as analyzed above and not wrong, then for the sake of the overall international situation and for the sake of cherishing the power of the world's great power like Britain, we should prevent him from going deep into the wrong path. Moreover, there is the possibility of correcting the deep wrong path. The key is to clearly show Chamberlain what he will encounter and his inevitable reaction. As far as the Far East issue is concerned, we do not think that the so-called "befriending Japan and dividing China" are completely correct. If we rely on Japan, then what he will encounter and react to are Japan's monopolistic attempts, anti-British movements, China's determination to resist, self-reliance, and the sympathy and assistance of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries. All of these have made negative annotations to these two words. At the end of last month, the United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty. This new situation created is the object that Chamberlain's policy will contact when it is promoted. Yesterday, the United States and France made firm and frank representations to Japan on the issue of Tianjin silver reserves. This momentum is also sufficient to provide momentum for the transformation of Chamberlain's policy. The Chinese army has recently inflicted a serious blow on the invaders at the foot of the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi. This at least provides new information for those who doubt the future of China's resistance and those who believe in the omnipotence of Japanese military force to re-evaluate and awaken the dream of compromise and appeasement. In short, Chamberlain's policy is probably not as bad as it is said to be, but the current situation is indeed moving towards brightness and does not allow all evils to grow. If we follow Chamberlain's policy and push forward in a straight line, we cannot imagine its future, but the current situation has indeed created a smooth path for Chamberlain's policy to turn towards brightness.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Behavior in Various Places Is Purely Instigated by the Japanese Side with the Purpose of Eliminating British Interests in China</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Wang Shijie, the former Minister of Education and current chairman of the Sino-British Cultural Association, today entrusted Reuters to publish a statement: The anti-British movement in North China and other Japanese-occupied areas is purely instigated by the Japanese side, aiming to exclude British interests from China and force Britain to accept Japan's excessive demands. This should not be misunderstood. In the past decade, Sino-British relations have become increasingly harmonious, and the Chinese people have a friendly feeling towards the British. The current situation arising from the Tokyo talks has caused those who are deeply concerned about Sino-British friendship to feel a little anxious. This is a fact, but I am confident that if British responsible politicians implement the guarantee that they will continue to support China economically, as advocated by some influential newspapers in London, then these anxieties will disappear completely, and Sino-British friendship will become even stronger. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Wuhan newspaper run by the Japanese side today stated that on the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Hankou will hold a large-scale anti-British demonstration, and the Japanese side will also participate. The Japanese expatriates will first gather at the shrine, then go to the British consulate to submit a resolution, and then go to the city to participate in the Chinese demonstration. It is generally believed that the Chinese will not necessarily march in the former British concession. Anti-British slogans have been posted everywhere today, but no one pays attention to them. There will be anti-British speeches everywhere tomorrow. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jameson, the British Consul-General in Tianjin, submitted a written protest to Japanese Consul-General Tashiro yesterday regarding the anti-British demonstrations in North China, demanding that the Japanese authorities suppress the continued anti-British activities in the occupied areas and protect British property. As of the dispatch, the Japanese side has not yet submitted a reply. (10th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Transportation Experts Will Arrive in Hong Kong Soon</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to sources here today, the Ministry of Communications has now sent Mr. Pan as a representative to fly to Hong Kong today to welcome seven American transportation experts who will arrive here on the 22nd. It is reported that these seven transportation experts were sent to China after Chen Guangfu, the Chinese economic representative in the United States, and US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau discussed it. Their task is to guide China to accelerate the methods of highway transportation. Dr. Baker, the financial advisor to the National Government who went to the United States last month, will also come with the seven people. It is reported that after the seven people arrive in Hong Kong, they will go to Haiphong to Kunming to inspect the highway situation by car, three cars and two trucks, so that after arriving in Chongqing, they will submit an opinion to the National Government. After that, they will go to the northwest to investigate the highway traffic situation. (10th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Northern Seaport Is Blockaded by Japan</h3>

<h3>Resolutions of the Party and Government Committee in the War Zone: Establish Branch Committees in Four War Zones and Guerrilla Commanders Are Responsible for Both Party and Government Affairs</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Shao Lizi, the secretary of the Party and Government Committee in the war zone, told the Huitong News Agency reporter that the Party and Government Committee in the war zone held a meeting the other day, chaired by President Chiang, and made important resolutions on promoting cooperation between the party, government, and military in the war zone: (1) Establish "branch committees of the Party and Government Committee" in the four war zones, and the chairman will be appointed by the President. (2) In the guerrilla areas, the guerrilla commanders will be responsible for both party and government affairs, so as to achieve cooperation. (10th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Li Jiasen (transliteration), vice chairman of the Party and Government Committee in the war zone, the committee has recently drafted new rules for unifying military power in the war zone as a result of the general meeting. These rules also apply uniformly to party, government, and military affairs in the guerrilla areas. The committee has established four district committees in the war zone and guerrilla areas, and others are still being organized. The committee is seeking to adjust the relationship between the government and the guerrilla areas and to seek cooperation between the various guerrilla areas. The committee recently dispatched guerrilla economic teams to the rear of the Japanese army to destroy the Japanese military's economic institutions and various economic enterprises of the Japanese side. At the same time, it also tried to persuade the Japanese New Army to surrender, improve the military equipment of the Chinese people, and train guerrillas. In the war zone and the guerrilla areas, there is no cooperation with the Japanese side to prevent the Japanese side from gaining a foothold in the occupied areas and using Chinese resources. Li said that these new rules were completely in accordance with the wishes of Chairman Chiang. According to Li, the Japanese side's plan was originally to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in the occupied areas and replace them with their own troops and to use Chinese collaborators. In short, the Chinese guerrillas are constantly expanding and improving, and the Chinese people will never cooperate with them economically. The Japanese side's plan will never be implemented.

<h3>American Missionaries in Kaifeng Detained by the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the American Embassy here, several American missionaries in the Kaifeng area of Henan Province have been detained by the Japanese army. This news was obtained by the Embassy through indirect channels. However, the exact number of those detained is unknown because Chongqing and Kaifeng cannot communicate directly by telegram. It is also unknown whether the detained Americans have been released. It is reported that the American Consulate in Hankou has been ordered to investigate this matter. According to recent news, there are currently eighteen American Catholic missionaries in Kaifeng, most of whom are women. There is also a considerable number of American Protestant missionaries.

<h3>Tianjin Currency System and Silver Reserves Issue: US and France Express Concern; Tokyo Negotiations Stalled, Japan Quite Anxious; British Statement: Unwilling to Negotiate Under Threat</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The French Chargé d'affaires in Japan delivered a note to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, stating that France has a shared interest with Britain in the Tianjin currency and silver reserves issue, and requested Japan to acknowledge this fact. It is also reported that the American Chargé d'affaires in Japan, Dooman, also visited the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and firmly stated that the United States also has an interest in the same issue. The Asahi Shimbun reports that the Foreign Ministry, in its reply to the French and American representations, expressed its determination to continue negotiations solely with Britain and rejected French and American involvement, considering it unreasonable. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government has not yet issued instructions to its ambassador to Japan, Craigie. Government circles have not received information that Japanese military representatives in North China intend to leave Tokyo next week if the Tokyo negotiations do not resume. According to sources here, the British government's attitude remains that it is unwilling to conduct negotiations under pressure. As for the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin, it is completely outside the scope of a political settlement. The evidence presented by the Japanese side regarding these four individuals is currently being studied by legal experts here. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The chief Japanese representative at the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference, Kato, today asked British Ambassador Craigie to declare whether Britain is making a "genuine preparation" to resume the Tokyo talks. He stated that if new British instructions do not arrive, the Japanese military representatives will decide to return to Tianjin early next week. It is reported that Craigie replied that Britain is not deliberately delaying the meeting, but he cannot say for sure when he will receive instructions from the British government. Kato stated that if the instructions arrive after the Japanese military representatives have departed, the Japanese government will have to decide whether to reconvene the meeting. Craigie visited Kato at the Foreign Minister's residence at 11:30 AM at Kato's request. Prior to this, the Foreign Ministry and the military held a joint meeting yesterday, at which it was decided that if Britain continues to delay, representatives of the Japanese diplomatic and military authorities in Tianjin may return to Tianjin. Today, anti-British demonstrators marched to the British Embassy to submit a resolution. The Anglo-Japanese conference has been stalled for ten days due to the failure of instructions from London to arrive. Observers here believe that the procedural issues have almost been resolved and that there is sufficient hope for a compromise on the Tianjin economic issues. Therefore, Britain's delay has another purpose: to use the delicate international situation to exert pressure on Japan. Observers here also predict that if Britain persists in its "delaying policy," the Japanese side may terminate the Tokyo conference and allow the Japanese diplomatic and military representatives in Tianjin to return to Tianjin. If Britain hopes to reopen the conference in Tianjin, then the conference will be reopened in Tianjin. Therefore, the fate of the Tokyo conference will be determined by developments in the next few days. The Asahi Shimbun states that if Britain adheres to its "delaying policy," the Tokyo conference will inevitably break down. However, if Britain and Japan can reach a genuine compromise, then a few days' delay is unimportant. British Prime Minister Chamberlain is a statesman with foresight, hence the result of the Arita-Craigie compromise on July 22. The statesmanship and sincerity displayed by Britain in handling the various issues of the Tianjin incident should inspire trust. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun states that if Britain delays, resolving the Tianjin dispute will become more difficult. It hopes that Britain will fulfill the assurances it gave in the Arita-Craigie compromise regarding the general issues that created the background to the Tianjin situation. The Yomiuri Shimbun states that the Tokyo conference was convened at Britain's request, and now Britain is repeatedly delaying, which is a lack of sincerity. The Miyako Shimbun states that Britain is evidently very concerned about the anti-British movements in China and Japan, but it would be mistaken if it believed that the anti-British uproar would not be greater if the Tokyo conference breaks down than it is now.

<h3>Extradition Issue of Four Chinese in Tianjin: British and French Jurists Express Opinions</h3>
<p>(London) Two prominent British legal authorities recently telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Halifax, expressing their dismay at the rumors of the extradition of the suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin to the Japanese side. The telegrams were sent by Bentwich, Professor of International Relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Miss Fry, Director of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The telegrams stated: "We have heard with dismay that the Chinese suspects in Tianjin may be extradited to the Japanese side. We believe that this action is illegal and that it should be proven using habeas corpus. We now propose to invoke this law and request assurance that no extrajudicial action will be taken to deprive us or the accused of the right to apply for this law within fifteen days."

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Receives Chinese Ambassador</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax received Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi at the Foreign Office this morning for a discussion lasting three quarters of an hour. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, is preparing to visit British Foreign Secretary Halifax today to inquire about the British views on certain issues in Sino-British relations. Naturally, the fate of the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case who are rumored to be about to be handed over to the Japanese side will also be discussed. The Chinese side here is quite pessimistic upon hearing the news that the British government has decided to hand over the four suspects to the Japanese side. It is said that the British judge in the British concession in Tianjin has completed his review of the evidence presented by the Japanese side regarding the four Cheng assassination suspects, so the fate of the four will soon be decided.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Italy Visits Ciano: Studies Alliance Issues</h3>
<p>(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, visited Foreign Minister Ciano today. Although the Japanese side has remained silent about the content of the talks, foreign observers believe that the two men studied various issues that could arise from Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. This is related to Foreign Minister Ciano's upcoming trip to Salzburg, Germany, to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In addition to the issue of Japan's accession, the two foreign ministers may also discuss the issue of how to "clarify" the relationship between Germany, Italy, and Hungary. This can be seen in the fact that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky will meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the issue of Japan's participation in the German-Italian military alliance, although Fascist Party figures here say that the Japanese government, at the request of the military, has actually decided to proceed, experienced observers believe that the Italian government, under the current circumstances, is not eager to conclude an alliance with Japan. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, if this were to happen, Italy would inevitably take a clear anti-British stance in China to support Japan, but Japan may not allow Italy to cooperate in developing China as compensation, which would not be worthwhile for Italy. Secondly, after Japan joins, the attitude of the Japanese military towards Britain will inevitably become more assertive. This is something that Italy, which does not want to block the path to understanding, would not want to do. In short, Italy will not take any initiative and will let Japan do it. If the issue of Japan's accession becomes a reality, it will not happen until after the delegation led by former Army Minister General Terauchi and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi arrives in Europe, and then the signing ceremony can be held.

<h3>China Purchases Thousands of Transport Vehicles from the US; When the US-Japan Commercial Treaty Expires, the US Navy Will Conduct Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Pacific</h3>
<p>(New York) Ren, the Deputy Manager of the Universal Trading Corporation, confirmed yesterday that the company is purchasing "thousands" of transport vehicles to be transported to the Chinese interior, and said that it will "purchase more vehicles," but a concrete plan has not yet been drafted. Sheehan, the Deputy Manager of the Chi-Hsin Company, will submit his report to the Chinese government after inspecting China. (10th AP dispatch)</p>
<p>The Chicago Commercial Journal reported yesterday that the Chi-Hsin (transliteration) Transportation Company here has signed a contract with the Chinese government to transport American high-speed motorcycle transport vehicles to the Chinese interior for use. However, the manager and other staff of the Chi-Hsin Company made no comments. Several months ago, the Universal Trading Corporation, which was established to manage the 25 million US dollar Sino-American loan, ordered 6,000 freight vehicles from American factories for use in inland transportation in China. Sheehan, the Deputy Manager of the Chi-Hsin Company, will travel from San Francisco to China on the Pan American Airways clipper on August 16 to investigate road transportation conditions in China. (10th AP dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Naval circles here observed last night that the US Navy will conduct exercises in the Pacific in January next year, which coincides with the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty (January 26). Naval officials stated that they are studying two naval exercise plans for 1940 for selection. The final decision will depend on how the international situation changes, so the location of the naval exercises will not be announced until the autumn. However, it is reported that the exercises will begin at the end of January and end in February. A naval spokesman dismissed the news that the navy would conduct exercises in the Hawaiian area as "speculation," and pointed out that the news was based on last year's exercises, which were held in the Caribbean Sea. However, he admitted that naval exercises, according to custom, would not be held in the same location for two consecutive sessions. The location of the next exercise will be decided by President Roosevelt. Naval sources recalled that the President changed the plan to send the US fleet to New York this summer and ordered the fleet to return to the Pacific coast to adapt to the international situation, so the possibility of conducting exercises in the Pacific in January next year is considered high.

<p>(Moscow) It is rumored that the Soviet Union has lent China 750 million gold rubles. Chinese and Soviet sources here have not confirmed this. However, observers claim that after the Sino-Soviet trade agreement was signed on June 16 by Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, and Mikoyan, People's Commissar for Foreign Trade of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will certainly provide the Chinese government with a huge line of credit.

<h3>Shantou Incident: Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) On Sunday, an anti-British demonstration was staged in front of the British Consulate in Shantou by rioters directed by an unknown party. The British warship "Tenedos" immediately dispatched troops to land and maintain order. It is reported that a Chinese person was injured as a result. The Japanese consul exaggerated the incident and presented five demands to the British consul, including a thorough investigation of the perpetrators, compensation for losses, and prevention of similar incidents from happening again. According to Japanese sources, British Consul in Shantou, Brandt, and the captain of the "Tenedos," Duncan, visited the Japanese consul yesterday and stated that the British side had nothing to do with the incident. However, they expressed regret for the unfortunate incident in which a Chinese person was injured as a result of the landing of British troops. The Japanese side is still demanding that the British side punish the perpetrators and compensate for the losses, and their attitude is very strong. (10th AP dispatch)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Foreign Ministers to Meet Soon</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to arrive in Salzburg tomorrow to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, may also attend. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to stay in Salzburg for one day and then return to Rome. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to official sources, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will meet in Salzburg shortly to discuss various diplomatic and political issues. It is reported that the Danzig issue will be at the top of the list, but the issues of Spain, Yugoslavia, and Japan joining the Axis alliance are obviously issues related to the entire Axis, but they are ultimately of immediate concern to the German side, with Italy taking a secondary role. It is expected that the German and Italian foreign ministers may also discuss a number of events directly related to Italy, such as the status of Hungary and the South Tyrol resettlement issue. The German Foreign Minister met with the Hungarian Foreign Minister two days ago. This meeting of the two foreign ministers may be seen as another expression of the unity of the Axis powers under a policy of encirclement. The recent rumors that Hitler and Mussolini will meet at the end of August to discuss the Danzig issue were largely caused by this meeting of the German and Italian foreign ministers. It remains to be seen whether Hitler intends to convey an impression that he must consult with Mussolini on the surface before delivering a speech in Tannenberg on August 27 and speaking at the Nuremberg Nazi Party Peace Congress. Those familiar with the matter are skeptical about this. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency has released a message stating that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is currently spending his vacation in Salzburg, Austria, and will meet with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in the coming days to review the common policies of the two countries.

<h3>Germany and Poland Clash at the Border; Three German Soldiers Cross into Polish Territory; Polish Soldiers Open Fire, Wounding One German Soldier</h3>
<p>Warsaw: A communique issued here today states that armed German patrol members who crossed the Polish border in the corridor engaged in a conflict at the border, during which one was injured. This patrol, numbering three, penetrated 300 yards into Polish territory, ignoring warnings. Polish border guards fired warning shots, also ignored. According to official sources, the incident occurred two days ago. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Officials have announced that at 6 PM on the 6th of this month, three German soldiers crossed the border into Polish territory, several meters into the town of Kamienica, located at the junction of the Polish Corridor and Germany. A Polish border guard immediately shouted a warning and fired a shot into the air as a warning. When the German soldiers continued to advance, the guard opened fire, wounding one. The wounded soldier was then carried by the other two back into German territory and driven away by car. German newspapers have not disclosed a single word about the incident. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Danzig: According to reports received here from Gdynia, Poland has begun transporting its gold reserves abroad. It is also reported that Polish forces have further tightened border defenses along the Polish-Danzig border. In the Polish town of Konitz, bordering Germany, some transportation routes have been cut off. Local authorities have also notified the public that police passwords must be obeyed immediately, or they will be shot dead without warning. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the sudden visit of Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Csáky to Salzburg to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the official press here has not provided an explanation. It is claimed that both foreign ministers are on vacation, so the meeting was purely private. However, it is possible that the two foreign ministers exchanged views on the Polish issue, as Germany's current foreign policy is centered on the Polish issue. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Danzig: According to information gathered here, a large amount of foreign-shipped arms has arrived at the Polish port of Gdynia in recent days. According to eyewitnesses, the crates are marked with the words "London" and "Paris," indicating that they were shipped from England and France to Poland. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding rumors that Germany will take new action before the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress, Weiss of the "People's Observer" today refuted these claims in an article in the "Nazi Party News," declaring that the Nazi Party Congress is a "peace congress." Germany is preparing to celebrate this congress, which demonstrates German unity, while others are calling it "German war preparations" or "Hitler's vicious plan." These are simply nervous reactions or fabrications. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary Meets with the German and Polish Ambassadors</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with German Ambassador to the UK Dirksen this afternoon, during which he reportedly told him that the UK and France share the same views and a united position on the issue of the Free City of Danzig. Any attempts to sow discord will fail. He also stated that the UK has provided guarantees to Poland and will implement them if necessary, without hesitation. In addition, the authorities of the Danzig Free City Council and the Polish High Commissioner are reportedly discussing customs issues, which observers here welcome, but they say that this conversation is of a local nature. Some have advocated holding an international conference, with the participation of the UK, to resolve the dispute between Germany and Poland, but this has not happened. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Polish Ambassador Raczyński recently returned to his country to report on his duties and held important talks with the government authorities. He returned to London yesterday evening and met with Foreign Secretary Halifax at noon today to discuss the Free City of Danzig issue. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Forster Delivers a Speech in Danzig</p>
<p>(Berlin) Danzig Free City Nazi Party leader Forster, after visiting with Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden yesterday, has returned to Danzig and plans to deliver a speech yesterday. Political figures here are paying close attention to this and say that German newspapers are using the term "Polish provocation." Forster's speech is likely a response to Poland. Although Forster holds no official position in the Free City, Nazi Party newspapers refer to him as the "responsible leader for implementing the Danzig Free City policy." He was raised by Hitler's sister, so he enjoys the Führer's trust. Forster will likely visit Berchtesgaden again early next week to see the Führer. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Concentrate Troops, Threatening Southern and Hungarian Nations; Germany and Italy Likely to Demand that the Southern Nations' Governments Allow Axis Forces to Use Roads and Railways</h3>
<p>(London) The news chronicle correspondent in the Yugoslavia capital recently reported that the news from the Yugoslavia border has caused concern that the European crisis will center on Yugoslavia. According to reliable information, Italian forces inside Albania and German forces inside the border of Slovenia are currently deploying heavy troop concentrations and stockpiling military equipment, ready to make a move. Key military and political figures in the capital of the southern nation now fear that the Axis powers will soon put pressure on the southern nation to comply with a pro-German-Italian neutrality in wartime, such as allowing the southern nation's roads and railways to be used by the Axis forces. The southern nation naturally cannot agree to this. Therefore, it is expected that German and Italian newspapers will begin to publicize accusations of disloyalty against the southern nation in the coming weeks, followed by more dangerous actions. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondents for the Daily Herald and the Daily Telegraph both stated today that Hitler is not satisfied with Hungary merely declaring friendship with the Axis powers. He is now putting pressure on Hungary, so large numbers of German troops are being deployed on the Moravian and Slovakian borders. The Daily Telegraph also reported that German troops are now advancing south. The Daily Herald reported that Hitler originally intended to visit the Hungarian capital in June, but soon gave up because Hungary firmly refused to allow thousands of German secret police to enter Hungary to protect Hitler's safety. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Army Commander-in-Chief Encourages Workers: Resolves Never to Rashly Sacrifice a Single German Life</h3>
<p>Dusseldorf, Germany: General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, recently delivered a radio address to the workers of the "Rheinmetall Borsig" metallurgical plant here and ordered all military factories across the country to convene all workers to listen to it together, in order to boost the workers' morale. His essential words were: "I now offer you, with the qualifications of a confidant of Führer Hitler, a sacred guarantee: the Führer will never rashly sacrifice the life of a single German. If we must make the ultimate, supreme sacrifice in the future, it will be necessary to preserve our nation." Excerpts from the speech are as follows:</p>
<p>General Brauchitsch first expressed his gratitude to all German workers, stating that German workers are the best workers in the world, manufacturing the best weapons in the world for the best soldiers in the world. The German nation allows them to be German soldiers, and I express my gratitude to you. The workers and soldiers of Prussia are all rich in comradeship. I invite workers to visit army exercises so that they can clearly see the efficiency of the equipment they make. At the same time, army soldiers should be sent to visit various military equipment factories to see the manufacturing process of military equipment, so that the spirit of comradeship can be further developed. As for the position of workers in military factories during wartime, it is as important as the soldiers fighting on the front lines. To this day, our country still needs to expand its military equipment. Rather than being despised and exploited, it is better to maintain a strong force that people fear. We do not need to threaten the countries of the world, but we cannot allow other countries to threaten us. A certain country's generals have already extravagantly spoken of victory, predicting that Germany will be forced into an alliance under the city and sign the Treaty of Versailles for the second time. Little do they know that the unity of the German people and their leaders is unmatched by any country in the world except Italy. Once the situation becomes serious, we will rely on this spirit of unity to achieve victory. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>The British King Inspects the Reserve Fleet; Air Force Exercises Continue</h3>
<p>Weymouth, England: King George VI recently inspected 133 naval reserve ships in the rain. French Naval Chief of Staff Admiral Darlan also participated in the ceremony. Afterwards, the King gave a warm consolation to the commander of the reserve fleet and all officers and soldiers, stating that it is commendable that all the warships can be placed in a state of war within a few days, which doubles the strength of the national navy. He then returned to port by yacht. As the yacht passed the warships, the sailors cheered and paid their respects. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The largest air force exercise in British history is still underway today. At the same time, the King inspected 133 reserve fleets gathered in Weymouth Port. The ships were arranged in the port, and the King inspected them in order. The royal yacht traveled 14 miles to complete the inspection. The sailors of each ship cheered loudly as the King passed. The King stood on the boat, not avoiding the wind and rain, to receive the cheers of the ships. The weather was bad that day, with occasional showers. Before leaving the yacht tonight, the King issued an edict to the Commander of the Reserve Fleet, Lieutenant General Horton, stating that he was very happy to inspect the fleet and asked him to inform all the officers and soldiers of this sentiment. More than a hundred warships can be lined up for inspection within a few days, ready for maritime service. This alone shows the proper peacetime organization. The crew members have only been enlisted for a short time, but they already have this effect. If it were not for the enthusiasm and close cooperation of all, how could this be achieved? I am certain that this fleet will soon reach the highest standard of combat effectiveness. Many retired officers and reserve marines have left their homes to join this fleet to strengthen the navy and serve the country. I am well aware of their great sacrifice, and I extend my congratulations and respect to all the officers and soldiers. Horton then wrote a letter on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Naval Reserve to express his gratitude. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British Air Force exercise and the British King's inspection of the reserve fleet have made a great impression in France and are regarded as clear evidence of British war preparations. The Paris Evening Post stated that the British Air Force and Reserve Fleet exercises are being conducted at the same time as the Danzig Nazi Party leader Forster is shuttling between Danzig and Berchtesgaden. This is not a coincidence, but a symbol. The French "Strong Will" newspaper stated that the British General Staff has worked hard to prepare as much as possible for a real war. France knows it can rely on Britain, just as Britain can rely on France. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the British Air Force exercise, according to a public announcement from the Air Force Department today, there were no fewer than 160 "air raids" last night, including 100 in the southern defense zone and 60 in the northern zone. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>A True Record of a Southwest Journey (Continued) 7. Impressions of Guilin</h3>
<p>Some say, "The Hunan-Guangxi Railway is the main artery of the War of Resistance." If this is indeed the case, then Guilin can be said to be the heart of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. It is responsible for the exchange and circulation of all human and material resources between Hunan and Guangxi provinces. At the same time, given the stagnant situation in the southeastern part of Guangdong Province, it also serves as a supply station for northern Guangdong, thus deserving the name of a junction for the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Assuming Guilin as the center, there is a highway to the south, passing through Pingle and He County, and a waterway passing through Pingle and Zhaoping to Cangwu. To the southwest, it is possible to pass through Lipu and Liujiang to Liuzhou. In the future, when the Guilin-Southern Guangxi section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway is open to traffic, it will also be possible to take the shortcut through Yongfu. To the northeast, it is possible to follow the completed Guilin-Hengyang section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway to Hengyang, connecting to the Guangdong-Han Railway north to Yuezhou and south to Qujiang. The waterway can also utilize the upper reaches of the Xiang River to absorb agricultural products from along the river, Lingling, Qiyang, and other areas, in order to communicate the freight of southern Hunan.</p>
<p>The branch road from Liuzhou to Guilin, after passing through Liujiang, turns southeast and must reach Lipu before heading north again, so it is also 270 kilometers. The car travels for seven hours, but there are many crossings along the way, so the time must be calculated more generously. There are two crossings from Liuzhou to Luzhai. There is another crossing past Liujiang. At noon, you arrive at Lipu, the center of the eastern Guangxi highway. Many travelers have lunch here, so the market on both sides of the highway is very prosperous. A long bridge has been built on the river north of Lipu, which saves a crossing. But after arriving in Yangshuo, it was discovered that the original bridge had been destroyed by mountain floods, so another crossing was added. The Yangshuo River is famous for its clear water. The origin of the saying "The mountains and rivers of Yangshuo are the best in Guilin" lies in the contrast of the river water. We took advantage of the time spent crossing the river to fully appreciate the scenery, which we felt was enough to compensate for the waste of time.</p>
<p>After passing Liangfeng, the highway gradually deteriorated, especially the section near the south gate of Guilin, which was simply full of scars. The car bumped violently as it passed. If you drive faster, there is a real danger of the car overturning. It is said that this is because too many heavy vehicles of five tons or more have passed through.</p>
<p>The car stopped outside the south gate. After being checked by the military police, it was allowed to enter the city. The scene inside the city was completely different from that outside the city. The streets were crowded with pedestrians, while the sides of the streets were ruins and ruins, forming a very strange contrast. Guilin's main streets originally had only two. One is the main road from south to north, divided into four sections. The southernmost and northernmost are called Guinan Road and Guibei Road. The two middle sections are called Zhongnan Road and Zhongbei Road. A cross street passes through the center. The west section is called Guixi Road, which meanders out of the city from Lizemen. The east section is called Guidong Road, which exits the city from Dongjiangmen. These roads all have traces of bombing. Except for Guidong Road and Zhongnan Road, which are relatively intact, most of the others were bombed to pieces, especially Guinan Road, which was almost completely burned down.</p>
<p>The caves of Guilin are all natural shelters. The air defense department has detailed maps, clearly marking where the people in that area should go when an air raid occurs. As soon as there is an air raid warning, the whole city is empty, so although many houses have been burned down in previous bombings, there are very few residents killed or injured, which must be attributed to the caves. Some time ago, the Japanese side threatened to bomb the caves, but according to estimates, it would take twenty 1,000-kilogram bombs, dropped in the same place, to open a skylight on the top of the cave. This is really easier said than done.</p>
<p>The Guixi Road area is Guilin's emerging cultural district. Lequn Society on Lequn Road is where cultural people gather. Recently, to commemorate the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, a war trophy exhibition was held here, sponsored by the Military Affairs Commission. War trophies from various war zones in Jiangnan were sent to Guilin for display, including aircraft wreckage, parachutes, medium tanks, various machine guns and other weapons documents. In addition, there were also self-made maps of the anti-Japanese war situation and various statistics. Tens of thousands of people visited every day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Dinghai Search Jintang Island; Self-Defense Forces Bravely Fight Back</h3>
<p>Dinghai Communication: Jintang Island, which belongs to Dinghai County, is located in the southwest of the Zhoushan Islands, isolated in a remote sea area, adjacent to Zhenhai and Chuanshan. The island is divided into three townships, Jinyi, Jin'er, and Jin'san, with a population of six or seven thousand people. It is a large island in Zhoushan, famous for its plums, called "Jintang Plums." Since the fall of Shenjiamen in Dinghai, the residents have crossed the sea to Jintang to take refuge, or transferred from Jintang to Zhenhai Ningbo to take temporary refuge, resulting in a sharp increase in the population and the island is very prosperous. Suddenly at dawn on the 5th, a Japanese First Fleet No. 4 ship sailed to the sea off Ligang on the island and anchored. Then, three motorboats were lowered, carrying 64 Japanese soldiers, who landed in Ligang. They swept the sky and mountains with machine guns and slowly searched the entire island. When the local self-defense forces heard the news, they divided into four groups and ambushed in the mountains and valleys to strike head-on. However, due to the disparity in strength, they retreated to various mountain peaks to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. After searching, the Japanese troops, fearing that the Chinese self-defense forces would take the opportunity to attack, did not dare to stay for long and fled back to the ships and escaped towards Dinghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attempt to Land in Xiangshan; Police Team in Shipu Town Resolutely Resist; Japanese Troops Retreat Without Disturbing</h3>
<p>Ningbo Communication: Shipu Town, which belongs to Xiangshan County, is located on the coast and is the only fishing market in Zhejiang Province. At about 7:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month, a Japanese plane flew over and hovered to observe. Soon, seven Japanese warships arrived, seemingly with the intention of landing. Upon receiving the report, the Xiang County government strictly ordered the local police team to resist to the death and dispatched a company of self-defense forces to provide reinforcements. At about 9:00 a.m., two more Japanese planes arrived and began bombing. At the same time, three small Japanese warships and five motorboats sailed into Shipu Port and opened machine gun fire on the shore. At about 10:00 a.m., two more motorboats sailed in, and the Japanese warships began shelling. The gunshots continued until 1:00 p.m. A Japanese warship approached the pier. The Chinese police team had previously set up defenses on the mountain, taking a high position. The Japanese troops failed to succeed. At about 2:00 p.m., the Japanese planes left. At about 3:00 p.m., the Japanese warships looted 12 civilian sailing boats and left reluctantly. In this battle, six Chinese soldiers and civilians died and seven were injured.</p>
<h3>Trends of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia; Three Thousand Yuan Remitted Back in Two Years; Technical Workers Return Home to Build Railways</h3>
<p>Regarding the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia after the War of Resistance, Li Qiaoguang and Pan Zhihui recently came to Shanghai from Singapore and Medan to purchase domestic goods. According to the conversation below:</p>
<p>Singapore is the capital of the British-ruled Malayan Federation. The Federal Government includes the islands of Malacca, Johor, Kelantan, Perak, Penang, Selangor, and Negeri Sembilan. This is the largest military base of the United Kingdom in the Far East, built as a military port, and maintains close military ties with India and Hong Kong. Medan is the capital of the eastern part of the Dutch-ruled Sumatra Islands. From Shanghai to these two places, Singapore (i.e. Singapore) limits the import of 500 people per month. The procedures are relatively simple. To go to Medan, you must obtain a passport and, if you are going to engage in industry and commerce there or take other jobs, you must also obtain the approval of the Dutch East Indies government, find a local guarantor, and pay an import tax of 150 guilders (each guilder is about 15 yuan). The procedures are more complicated. The cost of going to Singapore is about 12 pounds for a second-class cabin on a mail ship, and 30 pounds to Medan. Singapore is 500 nautical miles from Medan.</p>
<p>Singapore has a population of 890,000, of which 600,000 are overseas Chinese, 12 are white people, and the Malay natives are mostly scattered in the hinterland. Sumatra (i.e. Sumatra) has 230,000 overseas Chinese, of which 23,000 are in Medan. The climate in both places is subtropical. The temperature is often around 80 degrees. In Singapore, the British have established a Federal Government to rule the Malay Islands. The various territories are governed by the Sultans. The Federal Government has a Chinese Civil Affairs Secretary, who specializes in handling overseas Chinese affairs. The current Chinese Consul General in Singapore is Gao Lingbai. Sumatra is ruled by the Dutch government, which established the Dutch East Indies Governor to govern everything. The Governor's Office is located in Batavia. The Chinese Consul in Medan is Ji Yifan.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in both places are mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. Singapore is a tax-free port, and its nature is the same as that of Hong Kong. Overseas Chinese are very developed in industry and commerce, with the most shops selling wood, cloth, foreign sundries, and porcelain. The local products are mainly rubber, coffee, tea sugar, betel nut, pineapple, coconut citrus, and palm oil, as well as tin and iron ore. The investors in planting are mostly from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands. The cotton textiles shipped to Singapore are subject to considerable restrictions. Since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have been happy to buy domestic goods.</p>
<p>Regarding cultural undertakings, Singapore has two universities, one is Raffles College and the other is the Medical University, both run by the British government. The Medical University is very famous. The schools run by overseas Chinese include the Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Nanyang Girls' High School, the private Chung Cheng High School, and many public and private primary schools, all under the management of the Department of Education. Medan has the Sudong Middle School and 20-30 primary schools, which are managed by the Sumatra Education Association. There are five types of newspapers in Singapore, including the Sing Chew Daily, the Xing Zhong Daily, the General Summary, the Nanyang Siang Pau, and the New National Daily. Medan has the Sumatra People's Newspaper and the New China Newspaper. Both are run by merchants. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese has reached its highest point. Regardless of industry, commerce, or academic circles, they have worked hard and traveled around every day to promote the War of Resistance and refugee relief work for the motherland. Fund-raising organizations have been established everywhere. The funds raised are either remitted directly to the Central Ministry of Finance or transferred to the Guiyang Red Cross Society through the fund-raising association. In the past two years, more than 20 million yuan has been remitted to the motherland from Singapore, and nearly 10 million yuan from Sumatra. Overseas Chinese also pay national salvation donations on a monthly basis and have made great efforts to promote domestic goods and resist Japanese goods. There are more than 1,000 technical workers in Singapore who have returned to China to participate in the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, and hundreds have returned to China to participate in the army's War of Resistance. The British and Dutch governments, sympathizing with China's War of Resistance, have not excessively suppressed the patriotic movement of overseas Chinese. There are organizations of overseas Chinese in various places, united to engage in the national salvation movement.</p>
<h3>2/3 of the Suzhou Province Canal Embankment Repair Project is Complete</h3>
<p>Taixian Communication: The Suzhou Provincial Government, in order to prevent the Yellow River from entering the canal, ordered the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to rush to raise and thicken the eastern embankment along the canal and ordered the county magistrates of the relevant counties to assist in the process as much as possible. It was recently reported that, since receiving the order, the River Engineering Bureau has supervised the various engineering offices to step up the repair, and all the current projects have been completed by two-thirds. Its height can defend against two zhang of water, and a sub-weir of two chi is added to the top of the dike, for a total of two zhang and two chi of water. Recently, the water level of the canal has reached one zhang and three cun according to the Yumatou water level gauge as of the 2nd of this month, which is two chi and seven cun lower than the same day last year. The lake water level must be particularly high during the flood season, but this year's water has not been too strong. It is reported that the water level on the 3rd was one zhang and eight and a half cun, which is also much lower compared to that day last year. Moreover, the bottom water of the lower river this year is extremely small. The autumn harvest has been launched one after another. Even if the Yellow River comes south, if the amount is not too large, there are various precautions taken to prevent it. It does not seem to be a great danger.</p>

<h3>Rogers' Visit to Shanghai Amidst a Sharp Contraction in Foreign Exchange Attracts Attention; Meets with British Ambassador, HSBC, and Others; Rumor Has It that This Trip Has Yielded Preliminary Conclusions; Rogers Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rogers, the British representative of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, visited Shanghai to understand the situation of the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai and the use of Chinese legal tender in British trade with China. He held a three-day meeting with British officials and businessmen in Shanghai. The meeting has now concluded, and he left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday. It is reported that Rogers paid close attention to the trends in the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai during his visit. It is said that he reached preliminary conclusions during his meeting with the person in charge of HSBC Mercantile Bank. British business leaders also made statements to Rogers. As for the Chinese business and financial community, he did not meet with them due to the limited time. It is generally expected that he will use the findings of this trip to go to Hong Kong and exchange views with Song Ziwen, Bei Zuyi, and others. However, many believe that this trip will result in favorable planning for the Chinese legal tender. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rogers Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Rogers, the British representative (committee member) of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, has made significant contributions to the reform of the Chinese monetary system. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong three days ago. His whereabouts have been kept quite secret, and very few outsiders know about it. However, Rogers visited HSBC and Mercantile Bank on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons this week to meet with managers Hosumin and McLaughry, and to discuss everything with British Ambassador to China Kerr and British business leaders in China. Although the content has not been announced, it is said to be related to the Chinese legal tender and the black market foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Discussions Concluded; Left for Hong Kong Yesterday</p>
<p>After Rogers came to Shanghai and held separate cordial talks with British officials and business leaders in Shanghai, he generally understood the foreign exchange, legal tender, and the general financial situation in Shanghai. Because he still needed to have discussions with the Sino-British financial community in Hong Kong, he hurriedly left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the Victoria liner yesterday. When he left, Rogers' friends in Shanghai went to see him off.</p>
<p>Stabilization Committee Maintains Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from Chinese and foreign banking circles yesterday morning that Rogers' visit to Shanghai was related to the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai and the value of the Chinese legal tender. It is said that although the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has tried its best to maintain foreign exchange, making the statutory foreign exchange always stable at one shilling and two and a half pence for the British pound and 30 US dollars for the US dollar, it has provided as much statutory foreign exchange as possible for the import of necessities. Therefore, there has never been a so-called black market foreign exchange in various cities in the non-occupied areas. The so-called black market foreign exchange only exists in occupied areas such as Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sharp Contraction of Black Market is Beneficial to China</p>
<p>The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has been repeatedly hyped up by speculators, creating a distorted situation. Yesterday morning, the exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank shrank again, with the British pound at three and a half pence and the US dollar at 6.8125 yuan. It is said that the trend rebounded slightly in the afternoon. The HSBC quoted the British pound at three pence five nine three seven five and the US dollar at seven yuan yesterday afternoon. This contraction of the black market is undoubtedly beneficial to China as a whole, allowing Chinese native products to be exported steadily, and the import of luxury goods and non-necessities has been greatly affected due to the contraction of the black market foreign exchange. China's import surplus is expected to decrease, and the international balance of payments can be balanced. The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has decided to let the black market foreign exchange fluctuate naturally.</p>
<p>Gold Rises Again, Bond Prices Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, as the black market foreign exchange continued to contract, the black market price of gold rose again, and finally advanced rapidly towards a peak. The opening price was 4,220 yuan, then the buying momentum increased, rising to 4,350 yuan, then it fluctuated again. At noon, it rose again to 4,340 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 4,350 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan compared to yesterday. As for the stock market, the closing prices yesterday were: Unified Class A 48.4 yuan, Class B 41.6 yuan, Class C 39.55 yuan, Class D 38.5 yuan, and Class E 39 yuan.</p>
<p>Rogers' Mission Cannot Be Ascertained</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Shanghai financial community has attached great importance to the visit of Rogers, the British representative of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee, namely the Bank of England, to Shanghai for three days to meet with various financial leaders. It is said that Rogers visited HSBC and Mercantile Bank on Tuesday afternoon and revisited them yesterday (9th). It is also heard from reliable sources that Rogers did indeed have lengthy meetings with personnel from the two banks. According to well-informed financial circles in this port, Rogers has met with several British business leaders in this port and Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, but this statement has not been directly confirmed, and the nature of the talks has not been disclosed. As far as continuing to support the legal tender is concerned, it was not possible to ascertain last night whether Rogers' visit to Shanghai had any special significance. However, the fact is that his talks with HSBC and Mercantile Bank in this port had no impact on the market price of the legal tender. It was not until last night that the public learned that his arrival in this port was indeed a fact, but the financial community was already familiar with his activities.</p>
<h3>Increased Security in Both Concessions: Strict Searches Yesterday; French Concession Found Nothing in Hotel Searches; Curfew Enforced as Usual, Without Slackening</h3>
<p>Since the police authorities of both concessions began special security measures the day before yesterday morning, yesterday was the second day. The security situation was even tighter, with troops from various countries mobilized to assist in patrols and strict enforcement of curfew regulations. Japanese troops in the Nantao area conducted armed patrols yesterday morning. Detailed information is recorded below:</p>
<p>Strict Enforcement of Curfew Regulations</p>
<p>The curfew regulations in both concessions are nominally from 12:30 AM to 6:00 AM. However, normally, passage is allowed around 4:00 AM, effectively shortening the curfew. Nevertheless, during revolutionary anniversaries, the curfew is strictly enforced. With the current implementation of special security measures, the French Concession did not allow pedestrian traffic after 4:00 AM yesterday morning until 5:45 AM, when freedom of movement was restored.</p>
<p>Bridge Blockades and Traffic Control</p>
<p>The bridges along the Suzhou Creek, including the Garden Bridge, Szechuen Road Bridge, and North Szechuen Road Bridge, have been under Japanese control since the war. With the approaching anniversary of August 13th, the Japanese continue to block access to the North Szechuen Road, Szechuen Road, and Sinza Road bridges, leaving only the Garden Bridge open to Hongkew. The Kiangse Road Bridge, Denton Bridge, and Tibet Road Bridge are blocked by the International Settlement. The Old North Gate Bridge is only open to pedestrian traffic, while the Chekiang Road Bridge is only open to vehicles. Both vehicles and pedestrians can pass over the Tientsin Road Bridge. Armed detectives are stationed at the north end of each bridge to conduct searches.</p>
<p>Heavy Security on North Kiangse Road</p>
<p>North Kiangse Road, from the north end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to Avenue Road in the north, and the shops, residences, and alleys on the east side, have been barricaded by the Japanese with wooden poles and barbed wire fences, leaving only three gaps at the Chongming Road intersection, the Vincent Road intersection, and the Haining Road intersection. Since the authorities of the concession increased security measures the day before yesterday, the gaps left by the Japanese blockade are still open as before. On the west side of the road, the concession authorities have set up barbed wire fences, leaving gaps only at Haining Road and Chapoo Road, where Japanese detectives are stationed to guard and inspect pedestrians. All other transverse roads and alleys leading to North Kiangse Road are blocked. The southern end of North Kiangse Road, near North Soochow Road, is also blocked, allowing access only through the gap on the west side of Chapoo Road.</p>
<p>Public Bus Searched, Gun Found</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, police and defense forces in the International and French Concessions conducted the second day of security measures according to the special security plan. No terrorist activities were discovered in either concession. However, yesterday (the 9th) and this morning, police continued to arrest suspicious individuals in various districts of the city. Over a thousand people were arrested today. Yesterday, French Concession police searched a French-owned Route 21 public bus on Avenue Edward VII and found a pistol on a young Chinese man, who was arrested. Although the man refused to reveal his identity to the police, the police believe he is connected to a terrorist group or a criminal gang.</p>
<p>French Concession Searches Two Hotels</p>
<p>Yesterday at 6:00 AM, the French Police Department dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives in police vehicles to the Ta Fang Hotel at No. 33 Chen Chia Mu Chiao Road and the Niu An Hotel at No. 14 Chu Pao San Road to search the rooms, guests, luggage, and boxes. All guests were questioned in detail. The search yielded nothing.</p>
<p>Foreign Troops Assist in Security</p>
<p>In addition to prohibiting various gatherings and blocking some roads, the two concessions also mobilized all armored vehicles, patrols, plainclothes squads, and mobile patrols to conduct patrols and inspect pedestrians and vehicles along the way. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps in the International Settlement is also assisting in maintaining order. British troops are maintaining order east of Yu Ya-ching Road, American troops are guarding the area west of Yu Ya-ching Road and south of Robison Road, Italian troops are protecting the area north of Robison Road and the extraterritorial roads, and French troops and Annamese soldiers are responsible for the security of the French Concession.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Parade in Nantao to Intimidate</p>
<p>The Shanghai War Memorial Day is the day after tomorrow. The Japanese are deeply afraid that patriotic elements will take the opportunity to attack. Therefore, they have been intensifying their defensive work in the occupied areas of Hongkew, Western Shanghai, Nantao, Pudong, and Zhabei for several days. In addition to being covered with sandbags and barbed wire, each bridge is guarded and searched by four Japanese soldiers and two puppet police officers. The docks along the river have also increased their posts, and passage is only allowed during the designated hours. In the Western Shanghai area, due to the proximity of the Kunming Concession, the troops stationed in various cotton mills have been mobilized. Yesterday morning between 8:00 AM and 10:30 AM, the troops stationed in Nantao, with armored vehicles, artillery vehicles, small cannons, and machine guns, and more than 300 armed soldiers, patrolled the urban area, seemingly for the purpose of intimidation.</p>
<h3>Unified Class A, Eighth Redemption Lottery Held Yesterday Morning; 3.75 Million Yuan to be Redeemed; Payments to Begin at the End of January Next Year</h3>

With the consent of the National Debt Fund Management Committee and the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China), the four banks will discount and pay off debts guaranteed by customs duties. The eighth redemption lottery for the Class A unified public bonds of the Republic of China year 25 was held at 10:00 AM yesterday morning.

Pei Yun-ching served as chairman. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Pei Yun-ching reported that today is the eighth redemption lottery for the Class A unified public bonds of the Republic of China year 25. The lottery method uses the last three digits of the bond numbers. I will briefly report to you on the details of this public bond. The Class A unified public bonds were issued in February of the Republic of China year 25, with a fixed amount of 150 million national currency. This is the eighth redemption lottery, with 25 bonds to be drawn, each for 150,000 yuan, for a total redemption of 3.75 million yuan.

<h3>Changes Among Puppet Troops on the Shangchuan Line: Puppet Troops of Xu, Cao, Zhang, and Qin Defect to Pudong</h3>
<p>The Japanese army in Zhuchiao, Pudong, ordered the local people to negotiate with the guerrillas, and the Japanese army withdrew from Zhuchiao, but on the condition that the guerrillas no longer attack. According to the informant, the Japanese army has already withdrawn and is rebuilding fortifications at the station to ensure the safety of the railway. The Japanese army has also conscripted a part of the puppet army of Xu Hongfa and sent them to Zhabei, and continues to conscript the rest of his troops. However, in addition to this, a part of Cao Weizhou's troops refused to obey Xu's transfer. Two companies under Zhang Miaogen, led by Shen and others, also defected and joined Fan Gencai's troops in Pudong. As for Qin Xingyan's troops, apart from his basic troops in Kaohang, those in various towns on the Shangchuan Road have all joined Zhang Huifang.</p>
<h3>Warehouses Announce Goods Collection to Prevent Autumn Floods</h3>
<p>The first autumn flood tide of the Huangpu River will begin on the 15th of this month. Therefore, the warehouses along the river have issued notices to cargo owners to collect their goods stored in the warehouses, and are also organizing preventive works. The Jianghai Customs is also installing cement planks at the lower end of the riverside gate to resist the intrusion of the tide.</p>
<h3>British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Murray, Arrives in Shanghai; Patrolled North China Waters for a Long Time; British Cruiser Sails from Weihaiwei to Tsingtao for Reinforcement</h3>
<p>British Naval Commander-in-Chief in China, Admiral Murray, arrived in Shanghai on the British cruiser HMS "Cornwall" from Weihaiwei on the 9th. Admiral Murray patrolled and toured the waters of North China for a long time before arriving at the port at 3:30 PM on the 9th. The British warship HMS "Cornwall" is currently berthed at the British naval pontoon. It is said that Admiral Murray will stay in Shanghai for a while. It is also known that the British cruiser HMS "Kent" sailed from Weihaiwei to the waters of Tsingtao for reinforcement on the morning of the 9th. It is said that she will be stationed there for two or three days before returning to Weihaiwei to participate in the summer exercises. According to British naval sources, the British ship HMS "Decoy" did indeed sail to Fuzhou on the morning of the 9th to supply food to the British expatriates who are besieged there. Reports that the British destroyer HMS "Decoy" No. 75 sailed outside the port for patrol are incorrect.</p>
<h3>Airline Industry Receives Phone Call: Japanese Planes Bomb Fenghua Again; Five Japanese Planes Dropped Ten Bombs Yesterday Morning; Only Seven People Injured, Over Seventy Houses Destroyed</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese side has been bogged down in the war against China without making any progress. Therefore, it has repeatedly decided to send planes to harass the rear, bomb undefended cities, and slaughter innocent civilians, attempting to threaten the people's hearts. Various places in eastern Zhejiang, such as Ningpo, Chenhai, Haimen, Wenchow, Xiangshan, Yuyao, Tz'u-ch'i, and Shaohsing, have successively suffered wanton destruction. The disasters in Ningpo and Chenhai are the most serious. However, this kind of behavior is only enough to increase the people's resentment. According to a telegram received by the airline industry in this city from Ningpo yesterday, Fenghua suffered Japanese planes again yesterday morning. The telegram stated that at 8:00 AM on the 9th, five Japanese planes arrived in Fenghua for the second bombing, dropping a total of ten bombs. One bomb fell next to the Ta Ch'an Hall in Chungshan Park, two bombs fell at the Kwan Ti Temple in Chungshan Park, two bombs fell on Peichieh, one bomb fell next to the telephone bureau in Butterfly Lane, one bomb fell in the Hsiang Fang Lane in Hsichieh, and three bombs fell at Pe Pu Ling and other places. Four people were seriously injured, three people were slightly injured, and over seventy houses were destroyed. There was no other loss.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships' Coastal Defense Freight Not Interrupted, But Cannot Be Immediately Shipped Inland; Customs Brokers Already Handling Through Transport</h3>
<p>After the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire companies first dispatched ships to sail the Shanghai coastal defense route, other foreign merchant ships also followed suit. At that time, coastal defense was the only channel connecting the interior, so shipping was unprecedentedly prosperous, so that the goods transported to the coastal defense area were piled up like mountains. However, there was a lack of vehicles there, and it was not easy to disperse the goods for a time, so Shanghai merchants did not dare to do much.</p>
<p>Therefore, the freight volume of the Shanghai coastal defense route has recently decreased a lot compared with before. As for the report the day before yesterday that Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson refused to load goods for coastal defense, it is not true at all. Because this morning, the Butterfield &amp; Swire company still had the Taiyuan ship sailing from Shanghai to coastal defense, concurrently to Hong Kong, carrying a total of more than 1,140 pieces of coastal defense goods, including piece goods, cotton yarn, soap, and groceries, which is only slightly inferior to before.</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson company's Yosheng ship is also scheduled to go to Hong Kong and coastal defense from Shanghai on the 13th of this month (Sunday). However, the goods transported to coastal defense cannot be immediately transported to the interior. That is the current reality. Therefore, recently, the Mao Tung and Chin Yuan customs brokers have jointly handled Shanghai-Kunming through transport with the Sino-French Express Company, transporting goods from Shanghai to Saigon, and loading them onto trains from Saigon to go directly to Kunming.</p>
<p>The first batch of goods was loaded onto the French mail ship Félix Roussel on the 18th of last month and transported to Saigon. It arrived in Saigon on the 25th and was immediately loaded onto trains on the 27th to transport to Kunming. It is said that the goods arrived in Kunming yesterday (the 10th). The second batch of hundreds of tons of goods was transported on the French mail ship General Chaffee on the 1st of this month and has now arrived in Saigon and will be loaded onto trains for transport to Kunming within days. It should also arrive in Kunming in the last ten days of this month. The third batch of goods will be transported on the French ship Société Marseillaise de Navigation à Vapeur (Messageries Maritimes) on the 15th. Therefore, the Shanghai-Kunming through transport can be called a success.</p>
<p>It is also known that the Chung Ho and Ewo transportation companies are also jointly handling Shanghai-Kunming express through transport and will implement it within days.</p>
<h3>Absolutely Prohibit Counterfeit Currency Remittances, Which Is Equivalent to Promoting Them; Strict Precautions Should Be Taken</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that the "Hua Hsing Bank" has issued "banknotes," and has repeatedly instructed all industries in this city to strictly adhere to their positions, refuse to use them, and absolutely stop the exchange of Tianjin-Pukow counterfeit currency. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has again reported that some people advocate using "Joint Reserve" notes for remittances in North China and limiting the delivery to "Hua Hsing notes" in Shanghai. If this is done, although both receipts and payments are counterfeit currency, the result is equivalent to promoting them, and will eventually become the guide wire for intrusion into the south of the Suzhou Creek. Strict precautions should be taken. It is strictly reiterated that it is absolutely forbidden to collect "Joint Reserve Notes" in North China and deliver "Hua Hsing Notes" in Shanghai for remittances.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Runs Aground Near Pingyangpu; More Than Ten Passengers Transferred to Shenjiamen</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Yangtse Kiang, chartered by the Hainan Shipping Company, set sail from Dinghai in the morning with passengers and cargo for Shanghai. When passing near Pingyangpu, twenty li from Dinghai, due to the rapid currents, she was accidentally careless and the ship's hull touched the water grid dam stone at that location. At that time, it happened to be low tide, and the waves were turbulent, making it impossible to leave the reef. The shipowner drove a boat and transferred all the passengers, more than ten people in total, to Shenjiamen Town. Taking advantage of the rising tide in the evening, the ship was dragged out of the reefs and continued to carry passengers to Shanghai. However, the passengers had already been terrified.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Encourages Exchange of Gold and Silver for Legal Tender; Guides People Holding Gold to Exchange for Legal Tender in Four Banks and Other Institutions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance sent document Yu Ch'ien No. 4353 to the provincial governments, stating that in the implementation plan of the second phase of wartime administration, the Ministry of Finance ordered the following financial matters: 1. Consolidate the credit of legal tender; (1) In the item of collecting gold and silver, it is clearly stated that "Incentives for Exchange: For those who hand over</p>
<p>Large amounts of gold</p>
<p>Over one hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 2% of the total value; over three hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 3% of the total value; over five hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 4% of the total value; over one thousand taels will receive a special bonus of 6% of the total value.</p>
<p>Handing Over Ornamental Gold</p>
<p>Those handing over over ten taels will receive a special bonus of 2% of the total value; over thirty taels will receive a special bonus of 3% of the total value; over fifty taels will receive a special bonus of 4% of the total value; over one hundred taels will receive a special bonus of 6% of the total value. The Executive Yuan will also award</p>
<p>Honorary Rings (法藍鋼)</p>
<p>(For ten or twenty taels or more) or armbands (For fifty or one hundred taels or more). The aim is to encourage the accumulation of pure gold through incentives." The ministry has requested the Joint Office of the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China) to instruct the gold and silver exchange offices to follow these instructions. In order to promote the exchange, we are sending this to your provincial government for your information and to instruct your local governments to</p>
<p>record and post the announcement</p>
<p>widely. In addition, instruct the heads of townships and towns to publicize the above-mentioned incentives for exchange and to guide people holding gold to exchange it for legal tender at the nearest branches of the four banks or their authorized exchange institutions. The handling situation should be reported to the ministry.</p>
<h3>Stores Should Accept Postage Stamps in Circulation; Be Careful Not to Buy New Postage Stamps; To Avoid Increasing the Number of Damaged Stamps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration is expected to accept the suggestions of legitimate groups and submit them to higher authorities to find a solution to the 400,000 yuan worth of postage stamps circulating in the market as small change. The public should also be careful not to increase the number of damaged stamps. According to a reporter from the Ta Tung News Agency observing in the market, some stores are unwilling to accept external postage stamps, hoping to avoid suffering from the loss of damage, so they would rather buy new postage stamps from the post office with legal tender for change. If so, the number of postage stamps used as small change will increase, which will also increase the number of damaged stamps. Therefore, it is unwise. It is hoped that these stores can accept external postage stamps and accommodate them. Sooner or later, the government will have a solution to avoid losses to the people.</p>
<h3>Seek Safe Methods for Ferrying Passengers at the Mouth of Chenhai; The Moufu Wheel Steamer has Established Comprehensive Procedures to Prevent Future Dangers and Maintain Passenger Transport</h3>
<p>Since the indirect resumption of the Shanghai-Ningpo line and after the authorities approved allowing the elderly, weak, women, and children to board the ships, the passengers on the Shanghai-Chenhai ships are crowded. Many passengers from Ningpo to Shanghai are numerous. Each ship leaving Shanghai has more than one thousand to three thousand passengers, and many of them are waiting in Chenhai in advance. Upon hearing that the Shanghai ship has arrived outside the blockade, they will hire small boats and rush to board the ship. Because the number of people is high and they are all rushing to get on board first, it is extremely dangerous. It is learned that on the evening of the 28th of last month, more than ten passengers jointly hired a small boat to board the De Ping steamer, but when sailing near the blockade line, it suddenly collided with another ship, causing an accident and endangering the safety of the passengers.</p>
<p>The Moufu Authorities Vigorously Promote Safety</p>
<p>In order to avoid dangers and ensure the safety of passengers, the Moufu Wheel Steamer authorities of the Lih Ho Foreign Firm in this city have decided that all tickets must first be purchased at the company before passengers can take the company's special barge to transfer to the ship, and they will absolutely refuse to board the ship on their own to avoid danger. As for luggage, there are luggage rooms and inspection offices in Ningpo and Chenhai. All the methods are extremely comprehensive, and a "Passenger Notice" has been printed and distributed to each passenger when selling tickets so that everyone knows. According to a reporter from the Ta Kuang News Agency, after the Moufu Wheel Steamer returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 9th, it was originally scheduled to sail to Chenhai on the 12th. Now, because there are still many foreign ships staying in Chenhai, it has been postponed to 4:00 AM on the 15th. The Da Jia Bank at No. 77 Duobo Road has been entrusted to sell passenger tickets.</p>
<p>The Ente and Baoli Sailed to Chenhai One After Another</p>
<p>The Ente ship of the Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company has recently been approved by the Ningpo Garrison Headquarters to join the Shanghai-Chenhai route. The ship is scheduled to depart for Ningpo at 4:00 AM this morning. The Baoli ship of the Yihua Foreign Firm sailed to Chenhai yesterday morning and arrived safely outside the Chenhai estuary at 4:00 or 5:00 PM yesterday. It is anchored in the waters of Chiliyu and will return to Shanghai after unloading passengers and cargo.</p>
<h3>British Warships Return to Hong Kong to Concentrate, Including Submarine Tender and Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>Amidst the emergency in South China, British warships were ordered to return south one after another. The British China Fleet's submarine tender HMS "Medway" returned to Hong Kong from Weihaiwei on the 2nd of this month, following the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle." In addition to the above two ships, the British warships currently stationed in Hong Kong include the submarines HMS "Regent," HMS "Roqual," HMS "Rorqual," HMS "Rainbow," HMS "Pandora," HMS "Parthian," HMS "Poseidon," HMS "Odin," the destroyers HMS "Fame," HMS "Firedrake," HMS "Scott," HMS "Dainty," the river gunboats HMS "Forester," HMS "Ladybird," and the gunboats HMS "Gnat," HMS "Robin," totaling nineteen ships.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reporters Launch Opposition to Rent Increases</h3>
<p>According to the English language China Press, Japanese journalists are leading an anti-landlord movement in Hongkew today (the 10th), and are attempting to unite the tenants of the Peias Apartment (transliteration) at the corner of Penglu and Chapoo roads to oppose the recent rent increases. According to the Japanese-language *Tairiku Shimpo*, the original owner of the apartment, the British Commercial Wide Corporation, on August 1st</p>
<p>Notified the Tenants</p>
<p>That from this month on, one-quarter of the rent must be collected at the exchange rate when the legal tender had not fallen, i.e., one shilling and two pence. This will effectively increase the rent by half. The Shanghai Japanese New Journalists Association and several people in the Peias Apartment have sent letters to all tenants, urging them to jointly launch an</p>
<p>Opposition Movement</p>
<p>It is reported that the first to start raising rents was the Broadway Mansions, owned by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Shanghai Hengchan Company, which notified the tenants of the building last month that rents would be increased by 35 percent from August 1st, and that rents must be paid in Hua Hsing currency from September 1st.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Suggest Cooperation for Relief; Market Price Limits Exist Only in Name; Authorities Have Agreed to Consider</h3>
<p>It is learned that rice industry leaders have again suggested that the authorities of the two concessions cooperate to relieve the rice market so as to stabilize the people's food within the boundaries. The Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee is now considering the rice merchants' suggestion. Over 800 rice stores, large and small, in the city have vowed not to purchase rice exceeding the limit, and have sent letters to the Rice Stores Guild to forward to the Municipal Council to find ways to crack down on black market deals. It has been a week, but the citizens' purchases have increased instead, so most of the rice stores have no goods to supply the market. Yesterday, when the bean and rice market opened at 9:00 AM, the rice prices were sluggish, and the rice stores stopped adding rice. The rice prices all fell back to two or three corners. The 19th issue of the survey of the city's warehouse rice storage, conducted by the bean and rice industry guild, was published yesterday, but it is still difficult to accurately determine the actual storage of rice stored by merchants and stockpiled elsewhere.</p>
<h3>The Case of Li Mingzhi of Wanbao Silk Factory Being Shot at: Allegations of the Factory Profiting from Inferior Goods; Zhang Yongkang and Mei Shiqing Arrested; The Peacemaker Was Actually a Wanted Criminal; Leaders and Assailants All on the Run</h3>
<p>Li Mingzhi, a Ningbo native, shareholder and manager of the Wanbao Silk Factory at 53 Singapore Road, and Xu Jianfan, a Qingpu native and shareholder, received as many as nine threatening letters between April 13th and July 10th of this year, purportedly from the "Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps," accusing the factory of profiting from the purchase of inferior artificial silk and demanding a ransom of 600 national currency. Initially, they ignored the letters, but later, the gang instructed Li to send a representative to meet near the Golden Grand Theatre in the French Concession. Wang Cheng, a Chinese detective sergeant from the Gordon Road Police Station, and Xia Shutang, a detective, disguised themselves as Li's representatives and went to the designated location and to a</p>
<p>Pancake Stall on Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>They arrested Meng Zhaojian, a 14-year-old Siyang boy, and Gong En, an 18-year-old Tianjin native, both apprentices at the pancake shop, who were sent by the gang to collect the money. The shop owner, Min Cuntang, a Siyang native, was also taken back to the police station. After interrogation at the First Special District Court, the two boys, Meng and Gong, were released leniently due to their youth and ignorance. The pancake stall owner, Min Cuntang, was sentenced to 20 days of detention as a warning. After the case was solved, Zhang Yongkang, a Jiading native who previously worked as a clerk at the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Route Cardinal Foch, secretly went to</p>
<p>Wanbao Silk Factory</p>
<p>and falsely claimed to Li Mingzhi and Xu Jianfan that he knew Shen Yunbin, the head of the Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps, and could mediate to avoid misunderstandings. He managed to swindle them out of 60 yuan for transportation and conversation expenses. Meanwhile, the two shareholders, Li and Xu, of Wanbao Silk Factory, requested the Silk Industry Association and Customs to inspect and certify that the factory did not purchase inferior artificial silk and guaranteed that all raw silk purchased was entirely domestic goods. Unexpectedly, they later received another letter, purportedly from the Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps, demanding 600 yuan to ensure Li Mingzhi's safety, or they would resort to</p>
<p>Drastic Measures</p>
<p>Zhang Yongkang disappeared without a trace. On July 3rd, at 11:30 AM, Li Mingzhi, accompanied by the factory's engineer Liu Feiyi and a Mr. Tao, left the factory by car. On Singapore Road, they suddenly saw a young man in his twenties standing across the road, dozens of yards away, holding a Mauser pistol and aiming at their car. Fortunately, the gun jammed and failed to fire. The driver, being alert, sped away. The young man chased after them and fired two shots, both missing. Li Mingzhi</p>
<p>Managed to Escape</p>
<p>and reported the incident to the police station. Wang, the detective sergeant in charge of the case, and detective Xia quickly apprehended Zhang Yongkang near Haig Road. Zhang confessed that his leader was Shen Yunbin, who was hiding in a refugee shelter in Xujiahui. They were unable to find Shen. They arrested Mei Renqing, a Hebei native, as an accomplice, along with other suspects, including Li Jianman from Hangzhou, Mang Suiliang, a local, and Ma Songxin from Changshu, and brought them to court. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng came to the Third Criminal Court to investigate. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated that after investigating the suspects, Li, Cao, and Ma, it was clear that they were not involved and requested their release. The court approved the release and stated that the defendants</p>
<p>Zhang and Mei</p>
<p>would be prosecuted for attempted murder, extortion, and fraud under the criminal law. The leader, Shen Yunbin, and the young man who fired the shots at Li Mingzhi's car, Zhang Jin, were still at large. Li Mingzhi and Xu Jianfan, the two victims, testified about their experiences, stating that they had known the defendant Zhang Yongkang at the Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Route Cardinal Foch ten years ago. Zhang confessed to this without hesitation. Mei claimed that he was coerced by Zhang and asked for leniency. Judge Huang ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Deaths by Shooting in Western Shanghai: One a Gangster, One a Soil Broker; Each Shot Three Times and Died</h3>
<p>Liu Dianyuan</p>
<p>Liu Dianyuan, 43, from Baoding, Hebei Province, lived at 93 Tong'an Lane, Route Mett Herst, and ran the Taixing Soil Brokerage at 6 Dingye Lane, Route Cardinal Foch. Yesterday at 3 PM, while Liu was talking with his partners at the brokerage, several thugs suddenly broke into the business, drew their pistols, and without explanation, fired three shots at Liu Dianyuan. Liu, unable to escape in time, was hit by all three shots. The first bullet hit his left arm and penetrated his lung. The second and third shots hit his right thigh and left calf. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, fled the scene. Afterwards, he was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 5 PM. His body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuchun</p>
<p>Zhang Yuchun, a 39-year-old Jiangbei gangster, rented a bungalow with no number in the Meijia Lane, Yong'an Creek, on the Great Western Road in Western Shanghai. He had considerable influence in the area and many followers. Yesterday at around 7:30 PM, Zhang went to the Zhao Family Residence on Route Cardinal Foch. Suddenly, enemies ambushed him and opened fire as soon as he arrived. Zhang, caught off guard, was shot in the throat, chest, and right hand. He collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, fled in all directions. After the shooting, police arrived and quickly summoned ambulance No. 85, which rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 9 PM. The Jing'an Temple Police Station ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and pursue the perpetrators to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>The Case of Li Yongkuan and His Sons: Closing Arguments Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled for the 16th</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, and Li Bihua, father and sons, notorious bandits and salt smugglers from Anhui Province, after the Nationalist army retreated westward two years ago, gathered followers in Songjiang County, Pudong Caojing, Xihudang, and Ruanxiang, organized bandit gangs, masqueraded as guerrillas, and committed arson, murder, looting, and forced the women Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian to marry their sons. They also killed Lin's mother. After the regular army was disarmed, they fled to Shanghai. Lin and She reported them to the French police, who arrested Li and his sons one after another and recovered stolen gold jewelry and leather clothing from the Lin and She families. These were handed over to the Second Special District Court, where the lawyers of the French Concession Administrative Authority filed public charges for robbery, murder, and deprivation of freedom. The victims Lin and She also commissioned lawyer Xu Yannian to file an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation of 8,000 yuan each for the defilement and 500 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses. The defendants commissioned lawyers Yi Zhendong and Lan Xuzhang to defend them. Judge Liao repeatedly opened court sessions to hear evidence and investigate, which lasted for half a year. The trial had initially been declared concluded. However, regarding the gold jewelry seized from Li's home, Li claimed it was his own, while Lin and She insisted it was stolen loot. A detailed investigation was required. Therefore, the court summoned the counter clerk of Bao Cheng Silver Shop to court with his ledgers for questioning, which proved that Li's statements were false. Following instructions, the court rescheduled the hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao, together with the prosecutor, reopened the trial, briefly questioned Li and his sons, and, considering the facts of the case to be clear, ordered closing arguments. After the prosecutor presented his opinion, lawyer Yao Zhaodi of the French Concession Administrative Authority and the lawyers representing the defendants delivered their arguments. The court then declared the closing arguments concluded and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 16th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement by Employees of a Money Shop: Two Offenders Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Kong Guangfu, an employee of the Rixin Money Shop at 9 Fuxili, Tianjin Road, was instructed by the manager, Hu Houfu, on the 11th of last month, to discount a remittance draft for 4,368 yuan at the Hangzhou Silk Shop at 48 Jixiang Street for 4,000 yuan. Instead, Kong embezzled the money and fled. He used 2,000 yuan to start a moneylending business with Guan Peide from Yangzhou. The rest of the money was used for gambling in the gambling dens of Rong Sheng and others in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, and for hiring prostitutes, spending 150 yuan in one night and engaging 10 prostitutes. Subsequently, the Rixin Money Shop commissioned lawyer Jiang Chiping to report to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Gao Zhen and detective Wang Qi arrested Kong and Guan and recovered 1,200 yuan in cash. They were sent to the First Special District Court for legal prosecution. The trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Court sentenced Kong Guangfu to nine months in prison and Guan to three months in prison. Guan could commute the sentence to a fine at the rate of two yuan per day. Kong was ordered to compensate the plaintiff 2,800 yuan in national currency, and Guan was jointly liable for 1,700 yuan of that amount.</p>
<h3>Prison Guard Allegedly Supplied Drugs to Inmates: The Guard Denies Providing</h3>
<p>Jin Mingquan, a robber from Songjiang, sentenced to seven years in prison, was serving his sentence at the Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet. On September 24th of last year, Jin confessed to the prison authorities that he had been smoking morphine in prison, which was supplied by Li Han, the chief guard, and Tu Kun, a guard. Tu Kun escaped. After the incident, Li Han and Jin Mingquan were investigated by prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, who then charged Li Han with dereliction of duty and Jin Mingquan with drug use. The trial had been repeatedly postponed due to the complexity of the case. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian reopened the Fourth Court to hear the case. The defendant Li Han vehemently denied protecting inmates and allowing them to use drugs, claiming that Jin Mingquan was instructed by others to falsely accuse him. Jin Mingquan then stated that his previous confession was true and not influenced by others. The court then declared, "According to the law, the use of narcotics is punishable by death. Are you aware that you will face the death penalty for confessing to using drugs in prison?" Upon hearing this, Jin Mingquan requested leniency from the court. The court, after deliberation, adjourned the case and stated that a defense lawyer would be appointed for Jin Mingquan for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The Case of a Woman Being Chopped with an Axe Late at Night: The Assailant Arrested and Sent to Court</h3>

The woman suffered severe head injuries but fortunately did not die. Fang fled without a trace until August 8th, when he was apprehended by the Water Police at Lujiazui and handed over to the French Concession Police for investigation. The French police yesterday escorted the assailant Fang Jinkun to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, requesting detention for investigation. The presiding judge briefly questioned him and ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Missing Dance Hall Girl: Found on Guofumen Road</h3>
<p>Lin Shuzhen, a dance hall girl at the Weigong Dance Hall on Ningbo Road, suddenly disappeared from home. After her mother discovered this, she suspected Chen Weiling, an employee of the Dazhong Firm on Seymour Road, who frequented Lin's dances, and reported him to the police, who arrested Chen. Later, Ningbo native Li Yuanqing and a woman named Dong Meimei were apprehended, but Lin's whereabouts remained unknown. On the 9th, Sun Dafa, the detective in charge of the case at the Old Patrol Division, discovered that Lin Shuzhen was being hidden by a woman named Ma Shi, who lived at 1 Maqili, Route MacKay. He arrested Ma, who initially denied it, but after strict questioning, she confessed that Lin was hidden in room C at 42 Guofumen Road. He went there and found Lin. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the situation and requested that the case be tried jointly with Chen Weiling and others. Judge Feng Shide approved the request and ordered Ma Shi to be remanded in custody and the case to be heard jointly with Chen and others on a later date.</p>
<h3>Family Dispute of a Deceased Traditional Chinese Doctor: Wives Confront Each Other in Court; Third Concubine Accuses the First Wife of Colluding with the Second Concubine in Theft; First and Second Wives Deny the Accusations; Court Adjourns the Case</h3>
<p>Dai Shoufan, a Fujianese traditional Chinese doctor, 62 years old, had some assets and therefore had one wife and two concubines. The wife, Qiu, 61 years old, and the second concubine, Zhou, 46 years old, were both from Dai's hometown. The third concubine, Li, 43 years old, was from Beijing. In recent years, Dai favored Li and lived with her at 12 Tingyun Lane, Route Lafayette, in the French Concession. The wife, Qiu, lived at 21, 280 Lane, Route Sapey, and the second concubine, Zhou, lived at 5 Caishifang, Caishi Road. On the 12th of last month, Dai died of illness in Tingyun Lane. Qiu and Zhou both went to</p>
<p>Manage the Funeral Arrangements</p>
<p>Li also had no objections. Later, disputes arose over the distribution of the estate, leading to quarrels. On the 2nd of this month, the twenty-first day after Dai's death, Qiu and Zhou were at Li's place preparing for Dai's memorial service. At that time, Qiu and Zhou instructed their children to move the deposited leather trunks to their own residences. Li seized the opportunity to report to the French Concession Police, ordering detectives to arrest Qiu and Zhou. Qiu had already been released on bail through lawyer Ge Zhitan. The French Concession Police yesterday escorted Zhou to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District and also summoned Qiu to court. According to the plaintiff Li's accusation, Qiu was</p>
<p>Accused of Theft</p>
<p>Judge Wu Ke presided over the case. Qiu and Zhou both stated that Li was trying to monopolize the estate of the deceased Dai Shoufan and fabricated the accusations, requesting the judge to investigate thoroughly. Lawyer Ge Zhitan then stated to the court that the case was purely a domestic dispute and did not constitute theft, requesting the court to grant bail to the defendant Dai Zhou. The court, considering the case to be a domestic matter, ordered Dai Qiu to remain on her original bail and Dai Zhou to provide a guarantor who could be called upon at any time, adjourning the case until the 17th of this month for further investigation.</p>

<h3>The Case of Xue Ashun, Owner of the Yilun Silk Factory in Wuxi, Being Kidnapped and Murdered: The Main Culprit, Hou Genxiang, Charged with Murder; A Female Servant Voluntarily Surrenders to the Police to Testify</h3>
<p>Xue Ashun, a Wuxi native who ran the Yilun Silk Factory in Butterfly Village, Wuxi, had his home robbed on May 4th of last year. On March 25th of this year, he was kidnapped and a ransom of 1,900 yuan was demanded. Because negotiations failed, he was murdered by the bandits. His wife, Xue Dai, was also detained and suffered gunshot wounds to her head. She was later released by the bandits and</p>
<p>Escaped to Shanghai. On the 2nd of the month, Xue Dai discovered that the bandit who killed her husband, Hou Genxiang, was living in room 20 of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road. She reported this to the Old Zhabei Patrol Division, and Chinese Chief Detective Yun A'gen, Detective Zhai Jiaju, and Detective Qin Boliang arrested Hou and a suspect, Pan Yaoming, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the interrogation continued.

Judge Feng Shide questioned Liu Wushi and after her testimony confirming the circumstances of Hou's killing Xue, the court ordered Hou to be remanded in custody and scheduled a further hearing. Pan Yaoming was released.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>

<p>Robbery in Fahua - Five robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Shi Erlang, a Haimen native who worked at the Shengsheng Milk Shed in Fahua West Town, at around 10 PM the previous night. Shi was outside enjoying the cool air and unaware of the robbers. He stepped forward to ask what they wanted and was threatened with guns by two robbers, who told him not to make a sound. The other three robbers entered the house and robbed him of 25 yuan in legal tender, a gold ring, and a Xiangyun yarn jacket and trousers. After stealing the goods, the robbers escaped into the darkness.</p>
<p>Man Injured by a Vehicle - At around 7 AM yesterday morning, a garbage truck No. 748 from the French Municipal Council was driving past the entrance of 421 Route Lafayette when a man on a bicycle suddenly came out of a lane into the road.

<h3>Catering Industry Raises Prices Again: Each Meal Must Cost 20 Yuan or More</h3>
<p>Due to the tight foreign exchange, soaring gold prices, and increased costs in various industries in the city, the prices of all kinds of goods have increased, even those industries unrelated to foreign exchange. The catering industry in the city has already raised prices twice. An ordinary meal now costs between 15 and 20 yuan. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice, the industry has announced another price increase starting on the 15th of this month. The highest price increase is as high as 22 yuan per meal. It is truly not easy to eat a meal these days.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Today's local news column of your newspaper contains a report on the case involving a mother and son and the Jingli Elementary School. The content involves Songru and is very untrue. Therefore, I must write a letter to correct it. The board of directors hired Mr. Shen Ronghua as the principal. This case has nothing to do with Songru. Schools are social enterprises, not private property. Although Songru is a weak woman, she knows a little about education laws. Therefore, she became independent in 1937 and took a job at the Shanghai Women's Preparatory School. Recently, she has been working for the Aimeilan Embroidery Company. She has no intention of scheming against the school. Why would she need to provoke the feelings between Fuhua and her mother? The report is clearly intended to confuse public opinion. Therefore, I am writing this letter to correct it. I hope it will be published in the letters column. Yours sincerely, Zhang Songru, August 9th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I have read a news item in the local news column of your newspaper on the 6th of this month about the Railway Department's efforts to provide relief to unemployed railway workers. The gist of the report is that "after the successive fall of the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Ping-Han, and Jin-Pu railways, most of the railway workers lost their jobs. The railway trade unions petitioned the Ministry of Railways for relief. Recently, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the situation of the workers and has formulated relief measures, which will be implemented separately to resettle them or maintain their livelihoods. The investigation has been completed and has moved on to investigate in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Suzhou." The Association wishes to raise the following questions: 1. The Ministry of Railways was merged into the Ministry of Communications in January of last year, but the report still refers to the Ministry of Railways. 2. Since the investigators from the Ministry of Communications have already come to Shanghai, the Association and its members have heard nothing about it. How did the investigators begin to investigate the situation of the workers? 3. Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Suzhou are all occupied areas. How can the investigators from the Ministry of Communications openly conduct investigations in these areas? Therefore, the Association believes that the report is a fabrication by traitors with ulterior motives. We are writing this special letter to you and request that your newspaper correct it. Yours sincerely, Yuan Qiaofu and Jiang Jiaxiang, Standing Directors of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union.</p>

<h3>The Landlord’s Ideal Calculation of the Second-Hand Landlord</h3>
<p>— Tenant 3</p>
<p>Foreign exchange has been shrinking time and again, causing the external value of the legal currency to greatly decrease. The prices of foreign goods have skyrocketed, and the prices of domestic goods are also rising sharply, which has become a common phenomenon. Some landlords who nominally operate as "foreign merchants" are envious, so they also raised rents, the reason being: foreign exchange has shrunk, our "foreigners'" income has decreased, and we cannot make up for the losses, so we must raise prices. Therefore, the standard for price increases is calculated according to foreign exchange. Currently, it is an increase of 30% to 40%, and this will be the precedent for future increases. Under such circumstances, the panic of tenants is imaginable, because their income is not calculated based on foreign exchange, and naturally, the rent cannot be increased by 30% to 40% at once. Currently, there are many such tenants who are devising countermeasures. I cannot help but offer them some advice for reference: They can ask these "foreign merchant" landlords: if the legal currency cannot buy foreign exchange at all (which is very possible), or if the black market for foreign exchange is completely abolished (which should be the case), what will you, the "foreign merchant" landlords, charge the tenants? What will be the standard?</p>
<p>Tenants, of course, are most afraid of landlords raising rents. However, among these tenants, there are so-called first-hand landlords who are not only not afraid of the big landlord raising the rent but even welcome it. As soon as my second-hand landlord received the notice from the big landlord to raise the rent by 40%, he happily came to notify me, saying, "40% is a bit too much, but some increase is inevitable. Haha, the wool comes from the sheep, sorry, haha, the wool comes from the sheep." It is an honor that the average third-hand tenant is seen as worthy by the second-hand landlord, enough to be considered a "minor sacrifice." Therefore, as long as the big landlord increases by 40%, the second-hand landlord can take the opportunity to collect four or five times that amount. Every modern second-hand landlord always raises four or five sheep with wool to shear, enough to provide for his endless eating and drinking. As for when the world is peaceful in the future, the sheep, whose wool has been sheared like an ugly duckling, will run away one by one, the big landlord's 40% will remain the same, and they will have to learn from it alone. These second-hand landlords don't seem to have thought about it.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Overseas Monitoring Suddenly Welcomes Willow Leaves, Miraculous Scenes in the Fire Reveal Lotus Flowers</p>
<p>Let's talk about the He sisters, who received a telegram from their father saying that he was ordered by the International Trade Commission to go to Xinjiang. Originally, it was said that he would go to Beiping and then to the Northeast provinces, but now that he was being sent to Xinjiang, it was likely that his trip to the Northeast was temporarily suspended. Because he was in charge of international trade import and export, his sudden departure to Xinjiang must be related to import and export. It turned out that the highway from Gansu to Xinjiang had been open for a long time, and domestic trade was gradually developing. And the railway from Gansu to Xinjiang would soon be fully open to traffic. However, senior officials still traveled by plane. This time, Mr. He was naturally taking a plane from Beiping to Xinjiang. The area of Xinjiang, nominally a province of China, was not much smaller than the main part of China – the eight provinces. Since – more than a year ago, during the Sino-Japanese War, some people had gone to Xinjiang for development. Afterwards, the number of people going there increased year by year, and it also became more prosperous year by year. This land, because it was in the center, surrounded on all sides, and inconvenient to access, everyone was reluctant to develop. Little did they know that the climate was mild, the products were abundant, minerals, animals, plants, what didn't it have? It was truly a great fertile land. The output of wool alone could supply the whole world every year with surplus. This time, Mr. He was going to Xinjiang, probably for the issue of wool exports? Although his father wouldn't be delayed in Xinjiang for long, at most only two or three months, since his father had told them to telegraph their mother and younger brother in Guangzhou, they naturally telegraphed back immediately. According to the two young ladies' intention, they also wanted to bring their stepmother and two younger brothers to Shanghai for a few days. Firstly, the two younger brothers' studies could not be neglected; secondly, their villa had not yet been built, and coming to Shanghai at this moment would only be a waste of money. Shanghai was still a gold-consuming place. The two young ladies intended to have the villa in Liberty Village built as soon as possible, and after informing their father and discussing it with their stepmother, they simply decided to live there permanently. They would send their two younger brothers to study at the Liberty Village Elementary School. Because the two young ladies knew that their two younger brothers were inevitably somewhat spoiled and still had aristocratic habits. Not to mention the two little brothers, they themselves were also two pampered young ladies. But in this era, they couldn't be like this anymore. They knew that the Liberty Village Elementary School was full of children from rural families who were accustomed to enduring hardship and working hard. They wanted their younger brothers to also develop this kind of simple and hardworking spirit. (169)</p>
<h3>Student Expenses are Already High, Book and Stationery Prices are Rising Again, Using Old Books to Reduce the Burden</h3>
<p>— Yisu</p>
<p>The primary and secondary school textbooks issued by various bookstores in this city have recently been subject to further contraction of foreign exchange and rising prices. It was unanimously decided that secondary school textbooks would be sold at 50% above the set price, and primary school textbooks would be sold at 80% above the set price, effective from July 26th. This has further increased the burden on students.</p>
<p>To understand the detailed situation, I took the opportunity to visit the owner of a bookstore. He has some family ties with the author, so the information he provided was relatively sincere.</p>
<p>I started my question: "Now that textbook prices have risen, you can make more money on the books you have in stock!"</p>
<p>He answered very frankly: "Bookstores that sell on consignment don't have a lot of inventory. There are definitely some benefits to the books currently in stock. Speaking of bookstores, the interest is very thin, just enough to cover expenses. This decision to raise prices, in addition to an 80% increase for primary school textbooks and a 50% increase for secondary school textbooks, also includes an average increase of 30% to 40% for non-textbooks. In short, 'hot' books (those in high demand) have increased more; 'cold' books (those in less demand) have increased less. As for stationery supplies, most have also increased by 30% to 40%. Of course, original Western books follow the foreign exchange rate, but fortunately, there are reprinted Western books to remedy the situation; but they have also increased by 30%."</p>
<p>Currently, all prices are soaring. Student’s personal living expenses alone are already very high. Now, with the increase in book and stationery prices, how will a student's parents bear the burden? Therefore, within the realm of possibility, it may be worthwhile to spend more time searching for the books you need at old book stalls, which can save you a lot of money. Below is information about the old book stalls in Shanghai that the author asked the bookstore owner for, as a reference for selecting old books.</p>
<p>After the war, old book stalls in Shanghai, like other emerging businesses, have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The area around Carter Road and Avenue Road can be said to be the center of old books, with a total of more than a dozen places, selling original Western books, reprinted Western books, and senior and junior high school textbooks, with a wide variety. In addition, most are located near Henan Road, Jiao Ma Road, Lafayette Road, and Baylor Road. Among them, the old bookstore on Henan Road near the Commercial Press is larger in scale and has a more complete selection of various books. There is a place opposite the fire station on the same road. Although the facilities are simple, there are many English literature books and Western magazines. Old book stalls on Fourth Horse Road mostly have Chinese classics and primary and secondary school textbooks. On Lafayette Road, there are many books for high school and some common engineering books. As for many other old book stalls, they are very simple and set up temporarily. Occasionally, you can find very good books.</p>
<p>The summer vacation will pass in a blink of an eye. I hope you will try it out when school starts.</p>
<h3>"New Gold Mountain"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Captain Fury"</p>
<p>After watching "New Gold Mountain", it really evokes memories of "Robin Hood". One witnesses the Pope manipulating politics and slaughtering civilians, so he hides in the green forest, unites the masses, rises up in resistance, and loyally serves the royal family; the other is oppressed by the big landlord, rescues his companions, roams among the mountains, and specializes in helping the weak, robbing the rich, and aiding the poor. After their sole target is defeated, they are also recruited by the governor. However, their spirit of resistance, struggle, and perseverance is worth learning. These heroes of the wilderness leave a valuable page in history, which is their spirit of resistance, struggle, and perseverance!</p>
<p>The construction of "New Gold Mountain" is indeed about writing this outstanding hero, General Fury, but the playwright does not emphasize the appearance of this character. Instead, he uses the power of the masses and their tight organization (such as using the white flag as a symbol) to set off their sharp struggle with the big landlord, which finally achieved success. This is commendable. At the same time, it tells me the inevitable failure of compromise. Duboli, who informed the big landlord, not only did not receive a large reward but was imprisoned in jail. This is a valuable lesson!</p>
<p>The director, Hal Roach, handles this play with very high skill. The greed and ferocity of the big landlord, the tyranny of the henchmen, and Fury's resistance, every scene is stimulating and pulsating; and the unfolding of the sharp struggle is also strong and powerful. To give a few examples: when those convicts in iron shackles drag their heavy steps and walk in a line, he contrasts them with the iron-faced, selfless guards with bayonets. A close-up of the scars on an ankle when the shackles are knocked off. This powerful depiction is precisely to strengthen the stimulus of the slaves' resistance. After Frey and Bleich fight, it is Frey who takes the blame for him. The union of only those who are insulted and harmed is not only touching but also strengthens the value of union. When the big landlord's henchmen forcibly seize the land and property of the people, they clearly dissect the cruelty and wickedness and the elimination of abuse for the people. The atmosphere is also very tense, such as the majesty of the cavalry coming and the beacon fire on the top of the mountain as a signal.</p>
<p>What is even more lovable is his probing and drawing of the character of Bleich, from beginning to end, he is extremely lovable.</p>
<p>A dance party is also handled in a lively and bustling manner.</p>
<p>Brahn Eyre, who plays Frey, is not tall enough, but his acting is very calm. Of course, the best actor is Victor McLaglen (Bleich), who is straightforward, rude, passionate, and lovable. His every move vividly portrays the personality of such a character. Compared with "The Informer" and "The Last Hurrah", he is simply a completely different person. Joan Bennett as Jenny, does not appear much. George Zucco, who plays the big landlord Torres, is also very good, and his greedy, insatiable, cruel, and ferocious appearance is very realistic.</p>
<p>Among the films released in various theaters during this summer vacation, "New Gold Mountain" should be the most outstanding.</p>
<h3>Does the Soul Really Exist? (Continuation 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>(3) People have religious ideas! Religious ideas are a unique human nature; no higher animals have them because they have no soul. Only humans, whether civilized, barbarian, wise, or foolish, have religious ideas, knowing that there is a divine being above humans and that they should be in awe and worship. They also know that the soul still exists after death, so they worship their ancestors. Although they have mistaken gods, treating man-made false gods as true gods (this is because they do not understand the true way, which is understandable), it is enough to show that they all know in their hearts that there is a god, and that the soul still exists after death. (4) Humans all have conscience! Various animals cannot be reasoned with because they have no soul and no conscience. Although humans have different personalities, different environments, and different customs, conscience is the same: "The sense of right and wrong is inherent in everyone." This time, the world's people expressed sympathy with our country in the Anti-Japanese War, which proves that justice (conscience) is in people's hearts. From the personal perspective, doing good deeds brings peace and happiness in the heart, and doing evil deeds is blamed by conscience, and the city is always in fear and fear. This conscience is like a watch placed in the heart of a person by the upper enemy, just like the water and electricity company placing water meters and electricity meters. In the future, when people go to the Emperor to be judged, God only needs to look at our conscience to know what you have done in your life. Therefore, people cannot quibble or shirk responsibility before God. Some people often say, I do things according to my conscience and do not believe in any religion. However, on the day of judgment, conscience will become your accuser, because no one in the world has never done anything wrong since childhood, and conscience can only do its duty as a faithful witness, which is enough to convict you. Therefore, we must repent to God as soon as possible, ask Him to forgive people's sins, and believe in God's son, Jesus Christ, to be your mediator. Because Jesus died for you and made atonement for your sins, God will forgive all your sins. In this way, a change will occur in your heart, as if the debt has been paid off and you have been freed from the burden, you can get true peace and joy (to be continued) Christian Literature Evangelistic Association P.O.

<p>Editor's Note: Chen Yunshang came from the South and rose to fame in Shanghai; the film "Mulan Joins the Army" showed her skills for the first time, making a splash; her talents are outstanding, and it is definitely not accidental. The film industry has been sighing for years about the difficulty of finding talent, and few new people are cultivated; and Yunshang can shine on the silver screen, which is really rare and worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Random Notes of an Artist</h3>
<p>I am a little girl from the South. Since leaving my hometown and coming to the Shanghai film industry, although I have only made two films, I have gained a lot of knowledge in terms of working in the film studio; this gives me a better opportunity to work hard, and I am really very pleased.</p>
<p>Educational Background and Occupation</p>
<p>Looking back on my experience in the film industry: it has been four years since I started at the age of sixteen. Before that, my academic career: I graduated from elementary school at the age of eleven, and then went to Guangzhou Women's Normal School for two years. At that time, my father moved his family to Shantou for work reasons, and I dropped out of school halfway. Later, I moved back to the provincial capital (Guangzhou), and I myself took on the position of tutor at the local public education center - that is, training many children to sing, do gymnastics, etc., like a kindergarten. It was only after more than two years that I went to Hong Kong to enter the silver circle.</p>
<p>Family Situation</p>
<p>My family situation is very simple. My father has always worked in politics, and my mother only gave birth to two sisters. My academic name is Minqiang, and my sister's name is Zhiqian. She is also sixteen years old this year. During my childhood, my favorite thing was to learn singing and dancing. Therefore, the daughter-in-law of the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhu Zhaoshen, was our neighbor; she was British, and because she liked me very much, she started teaching me dance when I was ten years old; singing was learned in school. At that time, whenever there were recreational events held at school or in the community, I would often participate in singing and dancing performances as a child. Some publications say that I came from a dance troupe. Such rumors are absolutely untrue.</p>

<h3>Gu Erji's Family is Ruined</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Home Bombed, Beloved Wife Forever Separated, Trip to Xinjiang Terminated</p>
<p>Gu Erji is a famous actor in the drama world. Before the war, in the amateur drama troupe's public performances, his special type of acting was beginning to be discovered by the audience, especially in the performance of the play "The Inspector General", his achievements were quite wonderful.</p>
<p>He first appeared on the screen at Diantong Company, and Shi Dongshan's "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" by Xinhua was also his first work after leaving Diantong and entering Xinhua. By the time Shi Dongshan's "Night of Joy" was released, his old and decrepit form and meticulously portrayed acting made the audience very admirable.</p>
<p>In the production of China's first costume sound film "Diao Chan", he played Dong Zhuo, the treacherous hero of the Three Kingdoms, and the success after the public performance also laid the foundation for his success on the silver screen.</p>
<p>We still remember the group wedding of three pairs of artists under the Six Harmonies Pagoda in Hangzhou in previous years, Gu Erji and Du Xiaojuan were one of them. After their marriage, they had two children.</p>
<p>When the August 13th Incident occurred, Gu Erji and Du Xiaojuan followed the amateur troupe to the mainland to engage in drama work. Later, the amateur drama troupe disbanded invisibly, and Gu Erji also joined "China Electric" as an actor, and successively starred in films such as "Lonely City Bloodbath", "Sons and Daughters of China", and "Long Sky Miles". He also participated in the drama performances of Chongqing film and drama people.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese planes have been constantly bombing Chongqing. In a certain bombing, his home was burned. In addition to rescuing the two children, clothes and miscellaneous items were all turned to ashes.</p>
<p>Really, the saying "misfortunes never come singly" was fulfilled in him. In order to avoid air raids, he moved to the South Bank to live. Who knew that his wife Du Xiaojuan would get sick there? She died of cholera after only four hours. What was left was nothing, only two children who did not understand human affairs accompanied him day and night. He is now ruined and bereaved. Not to mention that he himself feels deep grief in this situation, even bystanders cannot help but shed a tear of sympathy for him!</p>
<p>Thinking back three or four years ago, he was still a single bachelor, and now, the branches and leaves are just beginning to be lush, but unexpectedly, he has been so violently devastated.</p>
<p>Originally, he decided to go to Dihua, Xinjiang with Zhao Dan and Wang Weiyi and his wife to develop drama work. Now, because the two children lack care and his own inner grief, he has terminated this trip. Greater anger will grow out of his sorrow. I believe that soon, he will resolutely take on the great responsibility again.</p>

<h3>Dance Country Anecdotes Dedicated to Resilient Children</h3>
<p>— Fengxiang</p>
<p>Tired Foot Restoration Method · Effective in a Quarter of an Hour</p>
<p>Dancing, this pastime, seems very easy and effortless; but when dancing for too long, the feet tend to feel tired, just like people who carry light loads for long distances will realize the truth of the saying "a hundred steps is not a light load".</p>
<p>Here is a "Tired Foot Restoration Method" created by Hollywood star Priscilla Lane to dedicate to the resilient children of the dance country.</p>
<p>The method instructed by Miss Lane is to first prepare two basins of water, one of which should be very hot and the other very cold; first put your feet in the very hot water basin, then quickly switch to the very cold water basin, and then take them out and dry them, apply almond oil and massage them, and sprinkle some cologne or apply some talcum powder. Then, place your feet naturally flat on a soft pad, and stop for a few minutes, and that's it. At this time, you will feel that the fatigue has suddenly disappeared, and calculating the time spent, the speed of the effect, it does not even take a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to remember that when you want to continue dancing, don't wear the socks and shoes you just took off.</p>

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>General Long Legs Is Busy Hanging and Chopping Plaques at Private Performances</p>
<p>Chen Xue (Diaoyuan), although he has the nickname of Chen the Fool. But he is not only not stupid, but also more shrewd and capable than anyone else. Because he deeply knows the secret of the saying "great wisdom seems like foolishness". So he has not lost his military and political position of importance since he was appointed as the Brigade Commander of the 74th Brigade stationed in Xuzhou in the second year of the Republic of China, until now. During the period, he was promoted from Brigade Commander to Xuzhou Garrison Commander. Soon after, he was promoted to Governor of Anhui for his meritorious service in handling the Sun Meiyao Lincheng train robbery case. After the Northern Expedition, he was reappointed as Commander-in-Chief, Chairman of Anhui, and today's President of the Military Senate. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China. He simply worked two fourteen-year wide errands. Except for Yan Baichuan, I don't know how many Northern Warlords were worn down by him (the word "wear down" in the northern dialect is used very well. The common saying is "burning a lamp to wear down the oil" (people are about to die and wear down the time") and such as "Second Entrance to the Palace" opera words "Ten years of cold window, nine years of wearing down." And "Visiting Relatives" One Many years of road becomes a river. A newly married daughter-in-law wears down into a mother-in-law." These wear down words are used very appropriately. Because all things that are slowly consumed into nothingness are described with the "wear down" word. This is more meaningful than using many words. Opera words are related to dialects. Therefore, there are often wonderful rhetorics in local dialects.) There are already very few people in ancient and modern times who can have ten years of good luck. What's more, he has already had thirty years of red luck and is still in a prominent position. Not only have I seen this person, but one of his sons is also my short-legged friend. Therefore, I know quite a lot about his character. He is not only bold and knowledgeable, but also able to handle matters related to the overall national situation. He can pick it up and put it down, and make decisive decisions. He doesn't recognize anyone when he turns his face. In the old days, the Lincheng Baoduzi case. He only carried a letter from an old man in Shanghai, and he broke into the fort alone on horseback. This kind of courage is simply as dangerous and astonishing as when Huang Tianba entered the Linked Rings.——(79)——</p>

<h3>Finance The Primary Target of Speculation: Gold Continues to Surge to New Highs, Peak Price of $4,365, Up $750 in Six Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold bullion market was filled with feverish speculation. The upward trend not only continued unabated but became even more chaotic. Everyone present was stunned and shocked. The root cause was a further tightening of both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates. Most major long positions were tightly held and continuously increased. Moreover, the available supply of gold, after being absorbed by Hong Kong interests, outsiders, and wealthy non-industry merchants, became even scarcer. Consequently, the market opened high at $4,220. Buying intensified after the opening, with gold shops aggressively raising prices, pushing the price up to $4,350. Subsequently, a temporary strengthening of foreign exchange rates triggered selling, causing securities firms and money changers to halt their aggressive buying, leading to a $100 pullback to $4,250. However, as foreign exchange rates stabilized and sentiment turned bullish, certain banks resumed their buying on dips, causing the market to close high at $4,340 by noon. The afternoon opening was flat and weak. News of a slight tightening of foreign exchange rates soon reignited buying, pushing the price to a new peak of $4,365. Profit-taking by floating longs then caused a pullback to $4,350 at closing, resulting in a further increase of $200 compared to the previous day. It was reported that the off-market price after closing was $4,380, with buyers but no sellers. Trading was brisk, reaching 1,500 to 1,600 taels. Gold jewelry also rose by $20, resulting in a record high price of $440. Customs gold remained flat, while British pure gold experienced a slight decline.</p>
<p>Gold Bullion Surges Another $200</p>
<p>Starting this morning, each bar (ten taels) initially rose by $70 due to continued tightening of foreign exchange rates. The opening price was $1,220, with money changers buying twenty taels from gold shops, marking the day's low. After the opening, news of HSBC's exchange rate adjustments spurred a flood of buying. Although gold shops repeatedly raised prices and sold off gradually, the number of buyers was several times greater, pushing the price up by $80. A certain gold firm bought fifty taels from money changers at $4,300. The price then briefly pulled back to $4,280. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates tightened further, a certain gold shop and a certain bank aggressively resumed buying, driving the price up by another $70. Money changers bought ten taels from gold shops at $4,350. Thereafter, news of a halt to the tightening and a slight strengthening of foreign exchange rates caused a sudden shift in sentiment, stopping buying. A certain gold firm and money changers began selling, with securities firms also aggressively selling, causing a $100 decline. Money changers traded thirty taels among themselves at $4,250. News of renewed tightening of foreign exchange rates then reignited buying. A certain bank and gold firm aggressively bought large quantities. Although there was still ample selling from retail longs, the supply was limited compared to demand, causing another surge of $95. Gold firms traded thirty taels among themselves at $4,345. Money changers suddenly began selling, causing the upward momentum to falter, resulting in a $30 drop. Money changers sold twenty taels to gold firms at $4,315. A certain money changer then bought dozens of taels from other firms, suddenly pushing the price up to $4,340, the noon closing price. The afternoon opening saw weak buying interest due to stable foreign exchange rates, with the opening price down $20. Gold shops sold twenty taels to money changers at $4,320. News of a slight tightening of foreign exchange rates soon after triggered buying, with a certain money changer aggressively buying dozens of taels, pushing the price up by another $45. Money changers traded thirty taels among themselves at $4,365, an unprecedented high. News of stable foreign exchange rates and profit-taking by retail investors then caused the price to weaken. Gold shops sold twenty taels to gold firms at $4,340. A slight increase followed, with money changers trading thirty taels among themselves at $4,350, the evening closing price. The result was another surge of $200 compared to the previous day. It was noted that the price had risen for six consecutive days, totaling $750. The intraday fluctuation was $145. The premium of spot gold at gold shops over gold bullion was $10. The premium of standard gold bullion over posted gold prices was $65 lower. It was reported that opening was extremely rare.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Listed at $440</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry at large gold shops was $420 per tael. At 9:35, the price was raised by $10. Shortly thereafter, it was raised by another $5. At 10:00, it was raised again by $5. At 10:30, it was lowered slightly by $5. At 12:00, it was raised again by $5. There were no changes after that. The result was an increase of $20, with large gold shops listing the price at $440 and new gold shops lowering the purchase price to $438 by more than $20.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Suddenly Drops Half a Penny</p>
<p>A London telegram on the 9th reported that British pure gold suddenly dropped half a penny per ounce, falling to £7 8s 6d, causing the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price to also decrease to $1,212.3. The posted customs gold remained flat at $2.396. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by $0.3 to $1,207.6.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Purchased Regardless of High Price, HSBC Exchange Rate Further Reduced, US Dollar Once Approached $7</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's exchange rate announcement reveal a sharp reduction of 2.5 in British gold and a drastic drop of $0.5 in the US dollar. Both had broken the previous lows of 3.75 on the 8th of this month and 7.3125, setting new record lows of 3.5 for British gold and 6.8125 for the US dollar. Other currencies also saw severe declines. The unofficial market for British and US currencies saw constantly emerging new highs. The opening price remained unchanged from yesterday afternoon's closing price, but sellers were scarce, resulting in a market with transactions but no activity. Subsequently, the Japanese Zhengjin Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and foreign firms aggressively bought at high prices. Although the British bank HSBC was reluctant to sell, its appetite was substantial. Despite efforts by the Overseas Chinese Bank and others to sell, the supply was insufficient to quell the upward momentum, causing the situation to steadily tighten. British gold even reached a new record high of 3.5625, and the US dollar reached 6.9375. Near noon, the Western firm Sassoon resumed selling, and cotton yarn longs also began liquidating, leading to a slight recovery by noon. In the afternoon, continued activity by Chinese merchants and a certain Chinese bank caused the situation to soften slightly again. In the end, British gold tightened by another 1.5625, and the US dollar also softened by another 3.125. This month's futures followed the same pattern, ultimately closing at 3.5 for British gold and 6.8125 for the US dollar. Trading was brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sassoon Sells High After Holding</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London "Big Stick" (a reference to a specific commodity or financial instrument) for the near term was unchanged, while the forward term fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price was undetermined. London raw gold suddenly fell by half a penny. Exchange rates for British versus US and British versus French currencies were flat, while versus Shanghai it was down 0.0125. US versus British and US versus French currencies were unchanged, while versus Shanghai it was down 0.15. Central Bank posted exchange rates remained the same. Bank opening spot selling prices were 3.75 for British gold and 7.3125 for the US dollar, with no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, the market softened due to the scarcity of sellers, with Chinese merchants first settling spot US dollars for this month with a certain bank at $7. Subsequently, the Japanese Zhengjin Bank and importing foreign firms and the Overseas Chinese Bank successively settled spot British gold from 3.6875 with Chinese banks and a certain US bank, tightening to 3.5625, and spot US dollars from 7.125 tightening to 6.9375. Upon the announcement of the HSBC exchange rates, British currency fell by 2.5 and US currency fell by $0.5. All other currencies fell accordingly. After the announcement of the silver balancing tax, the exemption remained unchanged. Western firm Sassoon then suddenly took the opportunity to sell high, and exporters also sold slightly, causing the situation to stabilize somewhat. Sassoon sold spot British gold to HSBC and Yuli (likely another firm) at 3.62. Subsequently, exporters sold spot US dollars to Yuli and other outsiders at 7.0625. Later, China-Italy (likely a firm) bought spot US dollars from counterparts at 7.0625. The Japanese Bank then resumed clearing, and Hong Kong speculators also wired in purchases, causing the situation to soften again. The Japanese Bank and Hong Kong wire transfers successively absorbed spot British gold from China-Belgium (likely a bank) and a certain firm at 3.59375, and spot US dollars at 7 and 6.9375. Near noon, cotton yarn longs suddenly began liquidating, Sassoon's selling interest resurfaced, and the Japanese Bank's appetite waned, causing the market to recover somewhat. Cotton yarn firms and Sassoon successively sold spot British gold to Yuli and other outsiders at 3.625, and spot US dollars at 7. The noon closing bank spot selling prices were 3.625 for British gold and 7.0625 for the US dollar. This month's figures were 3.53125 for British gold and 6.875 for the US dollar.</p>
<p>US Dollar Closes Back at $7</p>
<p>The later market opening was relatively stable. First, a certain Chinese bank absorbed this month's US dollars from counterparts at 6.875. Around 2:30, a certain Chinese bank suddenly began clearing, and Chinese merchants also absorbed current US dollars, causing the situation to tighten slightly. A Chinese bank settled spot US dollars with Datong and a certain bank at $7 and bought spot British gold from outsiders at 3.59375. Subsequently, a Chinese merchant settled spot US dollars with a certain bank at $7 and this month's US dollars at 6.8125. The evening closing bank spot selling prices were 3.59375 for British gold and $7 for the US dollar. This month's figures were 3.5 for British gold and 6.8125 for the US dollar. As a result, the current British currency tightened by 1.565, and the US currency softened by 3.125 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar at $405</p>
<p>A Hong Kong telegram on the 10th reported that today's exchange market opened steadily. British and Japanese currencies were unchanged.

The afternoon opening at 2:30 was stable and unchanged. At 3:25, the US dollar forward term softened by 0.03125 to 28.4375. The spot price was unchanged. The Shanghai dollar rose again by $10 to $410. The Japanese currency tightened by $1 to $104.375. The closing Shanghai dollar fell back by $5 to $405. The overall increase for the day was $28.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Currency Advances Three Pence</p>
<p>A Tianjin telegram on the 10th reported that today's exchange market opened weakly. The British currency tightened by 0.021875 to 0.02875, and the US currency tightened by 0.00375 to 0.050625. The Shanghai dollar rose by $1 to $128. The "United Currency" in the unofficial market rose slightly by $0.5 to $101.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Frequently Rise, British Gold Pound at $103, US Dollar at $106</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies rose sharply due to weak foreign exchange rates and soaring gold bullion prices. British and US gold pounds also saw sharp increases. There was strong demand for British and US gold notes. The market was buoyant. Hong Kong and French franc notes both became highly volatile. Singapore and Dutch notes all saw sharp increases. Japanese gold notes were mediocre at $1.09 in the evening market. Korean notes were unchanged at $0.915 in the evening market. Trading at the exchange was scarce. Xiangkang sold 200 gold notes to Rentai Jinde. Hongchang sold 500 Hong Kong notes to Xiangkang.

Other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Attempts to Rise but Stops</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange remained firm at over $200 per $1,000, showing a trend of rising first and then flattening. The opening price in the morning was around $205. Subsequently, the sudden increase in the use of cash caused the rate to rise to $218. It only retreated near noon to $210. It was unsustainable in the afternoon, with the final rate at $205, the same as the previous day's price. The interest rate offered by the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged at 18% in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Second Target of Speculation: Hoarding Cotton Yarn, Double Horse Rises Again by $32, Up $120 in Four Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is experiencing a sharp upward trend, and the general state of panic in the market is indescribable. There is a sense that buying cotton yarn will lead to wealth, which is an illusion. It is said that all wealthy individuals and the financial sector are participating and disregarding everything, creating a terrifying situation. Recently, while foreign exchange rates have indeed tightened, the price of one brand of 20s Double Horse cotton yarn has risen by $120 in a straight line over the past four days since the end of last week. Even when compared to foreign exchange rates, the yarn price has risen excessively. Although the actual demand from Guangdong merchants continues, it is said that speculative purchases account for more than 50% of their buying. Considering the cotton yarn itself, there should not be such an excessive rise in price. This situation is not good for the yarn industry.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened relatively flat this morning. Due to the significant increase in price the previous day, everyone was observing. The opening price for 20s Double Horse paper goods was $688, and the warehouse receipt price was $639. The momentum soon shifted upwards, and rumors intensified, leading to gradual progress. It was said that foreign exchange rates had further tightened, and speculative buying erupted. The market price jumped by $10, then by $20. The rise in warehouse receipts was frightening, with buyers indiscriminately grabbing, regardless of whether the value had reached its peak. The ex-warehouse price was $722, and the warehouse receipt price was $690, a jump of $51 compared to the opening price. Statistics for the half-day transactions totaled 1,380 bales, plus 150 bales transacted in the afternoon of the previous day. The price of 20s Double Horse rose by $32, Special Jincheng rose by $10, and Double Globe rose by $30. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Hong Kong 600</p>
<p>Counterparts 710 Wenzhou 60</p>
<p>Total 1,380</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market also rose sharply. Most of the activity was speculative. The price of 20s Moon Harp for this month was $427.</p>
<h3>American Seed Cotton Rises to $130</h3>
<p>Transactions in Chinese and foreign cotton have seen further progress. A certain merchant, Xinyu Factory, has purchased a large quantity, totaling 1,750 bales. Most of them are 20s materials, with other industry participants mutually buying and selling, making the activity exceptional. Another 1,300 to 1,400 bales were also sold. Fire Engine cotton has been sold for $113 (paper currency), and Tongzhou American seed cotton has been sold for $130, also (paper currency). It has been found that the market prices for various cottons have risen by another $5 to $8. However, British factories have not taken action, and newly established factories have also remained quiet. This is because their yarn selling prices are relatively low. Based on cotton market calculations, the factories cannot make a profit. Perhaps they will resort to reducing production. The supply from northern Jiangsu has increased slightly, with 305 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 230 bales from Beihe. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Sharutuo $150.00 Xinyu Factory purchased 250 bales, paper currency sent to the factory</p>
<p>Huisteng $140.00 Also 400 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Also $147.00 Also 400 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton $113.00 Industry participants purchased 200 bales Also cash delivery</p>
<p>Xinte Cotton $112.00 Also 200 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Pengjiapu $150.00 Xinyu Factory purchased 700 bales Also sent to the factory</p>
<p>Dulila $128.50 Industry participants purchased 200 bales Also warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton $120.00 Also 100 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton $177.00 Also 200 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton $113.00 Also 70 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Baled Cotton $130.00 Also 137 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton $110.00 Also 257 bales Also Also</p>
<p>Bailuoqu $130.00 Also 100 bales Also Also</p>
<p>$135.00 Dechengxin purchased 100 bales Also Also</p>
<p>In other news, the trade in foreign cotton in Shanghai has seen rapidly increasing prices due to the daily tightening of exchange rates. Yesterday, Pingguo Er New Special cotton had a transaction at $110. The price for American cotton, which can be spun into 32s yarn, was $180 yesterday. Although the selling price has been increasing daily, there are still many hidden reefs. If the news of yarn factories reducing production is confirmed, or if previously ordered goods from Japanese factories flood the market, then cotton prices will plummet. This is something that must be guarded against.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market opened firmly in the early morning. Speculators were quite active in the market. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported increases, which further boosted confidence. Reports of deteriorating weather in the cotton-producing areas caused the market price to rise by 7-8 pounds at closing. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 75 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by 20 pounds.</p>
<h3>Food The Third Target of Speculation: Manipulating Staple Foods, Though Supplies Arrive, Rice Prices Remain High, General Living Conditions Become More Severe</h3>
<p>The Shanghai people's food situation is becoming more tense. Although 15 boats of Songjiang rice arrived downriver yesterday, as well as over 1,000 packages of steamed buns, rice merchants are still spreading rumors that more than 20 ships of the second batch of Songjiang rice will arrive. However, there is talk that the supply of old coarse rice in that area will be exhausted after this batch arrives. Whether this claim is credible remains to be proven by facts. Rice merchants are currently using various excuses to cover up the high price of rice. Yesterday's market transactions remained limited to $26 for ordinary rice, $24.5 to $24 for foreign glutinous rice, and $24.5 for Winter Frost rice. These are unregulated goods. Off-market transactions have reportedly become less active. Rumors persist that high-stalk and thin high-stalk rice are still being offered at $26. Downriver goods are being offered at $24.5 to $25, high-grade rice at $22, premium grade at $20, and broken grade at $18. Based on the previous day's unofficial market, this can be considered the established situation. New粳 rice from Pudong saw ten to twenty dan of brown rice arriving, which was milled and sold by Shanghai factories. It was heard that off-market transactions were occurring at $23. The total number of transactions inside and outside the city was over 5,000 dan, which is not a small amount. However, it is impossible to obtain good rice without offering $26. There are also rejections for those willing to buy rice at the regulated price. Even if you buy it, it is broken and subpar, misleadingly called No. 3 rice. It is unknown what kind of rice it is. Currently, the few who have the resources and ability to store have already stored enough rice. However, the vast majority who do not have a dan of grain feel severely pressured. People are anxious, and the consequences are unknown.</p>
<p>Transactions in the guest merchant's unofficial market have also become scarce. This is because some shops are cautious about transactions exceeding the limit and are mostly hesitant. Moreover, it has been difficult to sell goods purchased within the limit in recent days. As a result, there are few buyers, and the market has slightly declined. However, sellers still insist on not easily selling, resulting in a slight decrease of only $0.2 to $0.3 compared to the previous market. The total number of transactions was around 1,000 bales. The price for Nanjing premium grade was $21.2.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to be tightly held, and there are still few transactions in the market. As for orders, it is heard that there is no proper solution due to foreign exchange issues.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Target of Speculation: Buying Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the No. 2 flour factory's price rose by another $0.1, changing to $5.6 in cash. All factories have temporarily suspended the supply of large ticket transactions and can only accommodate daily retail sales within the street, limited to dozens of bags per household. It is heard that selling warehouse receipts for returned goods is more popular than factory prices due to hoarding by outsiders in the market. Due to repeated tightening of foreign exchange rates, the selling price of foreign flour has reached $5.8 in cash.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's supply arrived continuously. Sellers are unwilling to easily sell new arrivals because of the extremely tight foreign exchange rates, rising flour prices, and better sentiment. Yesterday, Chinese and Japanese factories mutually absorbed wheat, and hoarders purchased enthusiastically, causing the market to rise by another $0.1 to $0.2. A total of over 40 truckloads of wheat were sold from Guan Dian, Shaheji, Danyang, Wuyi, Pukou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Nanjing, with hoarders purchasing over 20 truckloads. The remaining was purchased by Fu and Fu factories. The highest price was $8.43.</p>
<h3>Securities General A Bond Plummets, Approaching $4</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw the lottery draw for Category A bonds. A total of 15 Category A bonds were drawn this time. Therefore, the Category A market price should be calculated based on the exclusion of the winning lottery. According to past practice, the right to win the lottery is only about $1. However, the opening price for Category A bonds was $50, down $2.35, taking advantage of the unregulated location to do as they pleased. The news spread propaganda and amplified the situation. At yesterday's opening, short sellers believed that the exclusion of the winning lottery was the only weakness of Category A bonds. Therefore, the opening price was down $2.35, opening at $50. The market fell another $0.7 in the second session, creating a terrifying situation. Subsequently, the price was gradually lowered, falling another dollar. Other bonds also fell, but few exceeded $1. The agents on both sides of the buying and selling sides mostly reported things that were abnormal and stirred up trouble. The market price ultimately fell another dollar or so. Category A bonds alone fell by $3.95 after excluding the lottery. The volume of transactions was around $400,000. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category High Low Closing compared to the previous day</p>
<p>General A $50.0 $48.4 $48.0 down $3.95</p>
<p>General B $41.8 $41.0 $41.5 down $1.05</p>
<p>General C $9.5 $9.0 $39.0 down $0.75</p>
<p>General D $38.6 $38.55 $38.55 down $0.95</p>
<p>General E $39.35 $9.00 $39.00 down $0.95</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of $6.25.</p>
<p>The Industry Association reported that yesterday's rubber stock market continued to be very firm. Several stocks saw new highs, while one or two stocks fell. Foreign exchange rates remained tight. Holders were unwilling to sell unless prices were high. However, no large new capital has been invested in this market. The reason is that it is easier to make a profit by short-term foreign exchange trading, while buying goods requires waiting for market development and often takes a long time to see price increases. To discuss the value of rubber stocks, investors should study the public reserve fund items in the company's balance sheet. If the company's funds are in the Singapore currency system, or if they have invested in British gold assets, then their position is solid. Prices were soft at closing today, but selling was not active. In the industrial stock sector, there were no major changes. The Kaiping stock fell along with the London market price, which fell by 1s 6d, due to the possibility that the coal mines operated by British merchants in North China may be occupied. The Electricity 5.5% bonds fell to $75.5. There was no demand for other bonds.</p>
<p>London British Merchant Far East Companies stock market listing on the 9th of this month (Wednesday) saw more declines than gains. The Security Insurance stock fell by £6 to £22. The HSBC Bank London registered stock fell by £0.5 to £74. The Kaiping Coal Mine stock fell by 1s 9d to 13s 9d. The Gulalaklin Bang Rubber stock rose by 27.5d to 18s 1.5d. The Fu Company stock fell by 9d to 1s. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>London China Foreign Debt stock market listing on the 9th of this month (Wednesday) saw the top-tier Crisp and Rehabilitation (British issue) each fall by £0.5, with the former at £18.5 and the latter at £28.5. The Feixke Aircraft Bond note fell by £1 to £10. The lower-tier Longhai Railway Bonds continued to fall by £0.5 to £9. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Bald Dates</h3>
<p>- Sold for over $130 -</p>
<p>Since dates from Suzhou arrived in Shanghai, Jiaxing has also followed suit recently. Although the supply has increased, sales are also good, and there has been activity from Hong Kong merchants. Prices have gradually increased by $40 to $50. Bald dates have sold for over $130, and some are asking for $140. They can be said to be exceptionally high.</p>
