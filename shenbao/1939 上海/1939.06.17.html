<p>（香港）外訊、津日軍封鎖英法兩租界、今日爲第三日、未生事端、日哨兵賡續檢查出入兩租界人士、對各國僑民、僅向閱其護照曁衣袋中物件、但英僑則須與華人受同樣待遇、循序受檢、被迫脫衣者有之、搜後仍被迫退回者有之、華人入租界須費時七八小時不等、有立待二十四小時者、中國工入多名被日方阻不得進入租界、並勒令在僞臨時政府轄區內工作、法租界食物尙稱充足、英租界則較困難、中國小販兩人曾擬將蔬菜數籃遞入英租界、竟被日兵開槍繫斃（十六日電）</p>
<p>（天津）今日此間所發生之主要事件如下、（一）有華人兩名、因隔障碍物將筐籃遞入英租界，聞已被捕槍斃、（二）煽動者之活動、更見强烈、（三）食料繼續缺乏、今日侵晨馬塲道入口處所佈之障碍物附近、突發生槍聲數響、特一區南段居戶、皆從夢中覺醒、旋聞有華人二名、因將筐籃障碍物遞入租界、致遭槍繋、一時人心更爲驚慌、據日方宣稱、此舉係予他人以敎訓云、聞昨日煽動華人二千餘名衝入英租界未果之暴徒等、今日又紛至特一區爲外僑洗衣之商店數家痛署店主及職員等、不應洗滌外人之汚穢衣服、並勸各洗衣工人、勿爲外人服役、且將盛衣箱之筐籃毀壞、並將衣服等四處拋擲、繼乃掦長而去、今日英租界中居民、因聞日人屢圖藉口省視庚子事變死難日人之墳墓、結隊而入租界之說、稍生疑懼、現英當局對此事、已在考慮中、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本退伍軍人及其他日人、擬列隊入天津英租界省視庚子事變死難日人墳墓之企圖、已從該處日當局之勸吿、自動打銷、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（天津）日當局今晨加緊租界之封鎖、對於華人之出入租界者留難更甚，故得准通行者、爲數極少、英僑鑒於咋前兩日所受之汚辱、苟無絕對必要、不輕出租界一步、某華人工頭吿路透記者、今晨渠在萬國橋之法租界方面見欲入英租界之大批苦力、分三十人一組、被押入載貨卡車中、開往他處、渠詢過橋之某外人、究屬何事、該外人答稱、日人招此輩苦力赴他處工作云、食物情形、未有多大起色、今晨菜市雖蔬菜較多、然價旣昂貴、而貨甚劣、牛乳亦由卡車運入租界、但仍不敷用、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（天津）據日方消息、關於英頒事抗議日兵搜查英人過於嚴苛及刁難食物運入租界之事、已爲日領署方面拒絕、英領事之抗議爲電話中之口頭抗議、但日方之答覆則稱、「日本維持天津之和平與秩序、自有其權衡、不容他人加以干涉、」唯日方今日之搜查、雖一如昨日、但剝衣服之之事、已不再發生矣、此間人士多信、假若美國出而抗議、則天津租界之封鎖、卽可早日撤銷、狐狸公司之攝影員梅易爾已於今晚釋出、使英領事之心境爲之一鬆、美人麥克恩今日通過威爾遜街日哨兵綫時、雖屢决聲明本人爲美國人、但仍被照樣搜查、麥氏因於事後報吿美領署、美領署向日方交涉後、日方當卽表示歉意、認爲出於誤會、其後麥氏出入該處時、卽不再被搜查矣、因天津時局不定、英商船隻現已改泊秦皇鳥、（十六日美聯社電）日報載天津消息，據稱日方須有下述條件、始可解除英租界之封鎖、（一）英日會同搜捕以前及以後恐怖行爲之實施人、（二）切實取締英租界中之反日份子、（三）凡搗亂華北「臨時政府」之經濟上措施之企圖、須予肅淸、（四）英租界中華人銀行現存價値五千萬元之白銀一律交與「臨時政府」、天津日當局決計繼續隔絕英租界、直至英方接受並實行此項條件後而後已、日當局並準備採行更有效力的計畫、以抵制英方新的挑釁行爲云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（香港）津訊、河北省銀行頃決於十八日自法租界遷出、法租界當局特通知銀行公會、謂該行並未經租界當局之核准、自不得壇自遷出、且該行在法租界營業已久、若遽爾遷出、恐不免影響界內金融、實不易移出云、（十六日電）今日日軍對英法兩租界繼續封鎖、情勢雖緊、然平靖無事、大多數英僑前往英租界外者、昨日移入租界內、於是在日軍所置障碍物處發生意外事件機會、得以减少、今晨小菜塲空虛、冷氣肉類尙能購得、但蔬菜幾無從買到、今晨英國頭事館、對於日本仍不釋放二日前被捕之加拿大攝影家梅逸爾、表示驚奇、日人雖應允昨日深晚將渠釋放、然迄至今晨九時半、仍被拘留、（十六日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>倫敦負責人士　發表半官性質聲明　日所表示牽涉各國在華條約權利　如正式提出要求必造成嚴重局勢　屆時英不得不考慮採取積極行動</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中國天津市日軍封鎖英法兩租界事、此間負責人士均謂、此事性質極爲嚴重、並發表半官性質之聲明、說明英國立塲、略謂本案起因、由於日方指華人四名、牽涉程錫庚案、要求予以引渡、但始終拒不提出證據（英租界當局嗣允將此一問題、取決於超然性質之顧問委員會、日方未能贊同、並決定實行封鎖英法兩租界、日方發言人旋卽發表談話、涉及遠東嚴重之問題、查日本外務省發言人前於上月二十四日發表談話、其意態所示、威脅及於各國在華所保有之條的權利、英法兩國政府曾爲此事、提出交涉、案猶未了、而天津日方發言人此决談話、竟乃變本加厲、于以見四華人引渡問題、已不復成爲封鎖英租界之原因、日方所要求者、乃「英國應與日本合作、建設東亞新秩序」、質言之、英國應放棄援助巾國國民黨蔣總裁之政策、對於抗日份子與共產黨員、不容有所庇護停止援助中國法幣、停北國積各種貨物、」、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>天津英法租界形勢圖</p>
<p>不復縱容租界內不法份子、利用無錢電傳遞消息、禁止界內各學校採用反日敎科書、凡此種種廣泛之要求、足以牽涉各國在華所保有之條的權利、英國方面自必認爲性質嚴重、蓋其意義、殆欲英國在暴力威脅之下放棄其原來所行政策、英國政府、原曾向日本政府提出建議、冀使天津糾紛成爲地方事件、此項建議、日本當局雖已加以拒絕、但英國仍望其改變態度、反之華北日本當局若不幸而固執成見、正式提出新要求、自必造成嚴重局勢、屆時英國政府不得不考慮立卽採取積極行動、以保護在華利益</p>
<h3>美將聯合英法同提抗議</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）日本封鎖天津租界之事、該處美國商人同樣感受影響、故美國可望與英法聯合、向日本提出强硬之抗議、此項決定乃由國務卿赫爾與其主要顧問舉行特別會議之後而成立者、唯關於採取對日本之經濟報復行動、如拒絕日本之船隻與商業計劃、將出以審愼之態度、蓋恐嚴格之經濟制裁、足以引起戰爭也、據官方稱、卽使國務卿赫爾採取何種行動、亦不致使美國置之前線、（十六日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>日行動對軸心國作聲援</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據法方官員與外交界表示意見、日本封鎖天津英租界之行動、乃爲對於羅馬柏林軸心之一種聲援、蓋如是可使英法不致注視歐洲、而轉其注意力於亞洲方面、如是可使獨裁者有喘息之餘地、唯英法美現仍在不絕磋商中、但除三國政府竭力注意遠東局勢外、別無所知、同時磋商之內容、亦不得知、關於英法決定採用强硬手段對日報復一層、此間尙不能認爲可信、蓋英法政府討論之結果、認經濟報復手段未必有效、蓋日本現時之地位、頗能對英法作經濟戰爭、同時更可將此種封鎖推及其他各租界、允其如上海等等、據熟識時事者言、目前最可慮者、卽恐日人逼到英人不能不硬一舉耳、聞法政府對天津事件、決計站在英國方面、日本雖特別選出英國一國、作爲其挑釁對象、但法國決不變更共與英之一致態度、（十六日美聯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>交通安全運動週獻言</h3>
<p>去年一年之間，上海兩租界車輛肇禍案件多至一萬五千一百八十三件，死傷五千一百六十六人，租界當局惄焉以人命為憂，惕然謀預防之道，爰定於明日起，舉行交通安全運動週，用意至善也。夫肇禍案件所以開空前紀錄，歸責於行人擁擠，自不為無因。抑不僅擁擠，復以內地逃難者麕集於上海，不明交通章程，不知行路趨避，陡見風馳電掣之車輛，輙驚惶無措，進退失據，遂遭不測。更有駕駛者不顧路人擁擠，掉以輕心，而謂人必我讓，詎知車竟傷人。至於玩忽職務，視人命如草芥；自不小心，為輪下使人人知馬路如虎口，不容輕蹈，同時尤嚴格招待交通章程，毌得兒戲人命，使運動成為行動，誠市民之福也。</p>
<p>雖然，安全運動，治標之計也。肇禍案件所以如是其眾，若以人口擁擠，為其主因，則是大背於都市發展之原則；蓋都市之繁盛，固在於工商業之發達，而其必然招致之數千百方里之內，均以上海為逃難之藪故耳。故都市不患人口之擁擠，行人之擾攘，而患如何保持其秩序，策行路之安全，此其道又當從市政各方面加以策劃也。</p>
<p>上海租界之繁榮，大槪與中國內亂外患有絕密切之關係，自太平天國，小刀會，乃至義和團，辛亥革命，齊盧戰爭，以及國民苦命軍到達上海，每經一次事變，則上海必繁榮一番。惟獨「一二八」「八一三」兩事件，在戰事進行之際，上海頓現凄涼之狀。及八一三戰事內移之後，滬上又回復其逃難者「安樂窩」之地位。在兩租界當初規劃路政，視中國內地之道路，宏廣多矣，寗計及後此百餘年中促成租界繁榮之因素，與夫物質文明之進步有如今日之狀况者。其後亦嘗為適應環境之需要，因時因地，逐漸改進，終格於舊時設備，不能為大規模之改善。於是人口稍形增加，原有馬路，竟不足以應付此車輛遝行人擁擠之新局面，此肇禍案件所以隨人口增加而增加者也。</p>
<p>其在滬戰之前，工廠區域，俱在租界之南北，而租界亦以地形關係，南北直通之道路多，東西之道路較少，公共租界可稱為貫通東西之大道者僅新閘路愛文義路之與北京路，靜安寺路之與南京路，及親近正在放寬之福煦路與威海衛路跑馬廳路轉入福州路。在法租界僅有一霞飛路，及徐家滙路，此外愛多亞路之與福煦路，則現為兩租界所共管，法大馬路之地位，上接愷自邇路福煦路，與未來之威海衛路情形正相若。及一入滬西區域僅剩愚園路與大西路，康腦脫路，滬戰之後一切工廠皆向滬西謀發展，於是車運之自東西往來者鄧見繁盛，南京路旣不許貨運往返，新閘路愛文義路與北京路，及愛多亞路。遂為車輛東西往來之孔道。多數車輛，集中行駛於少數馬路，安得而不肩摩彀擊，擁擠萬狀，舉步維艱，穿越不易，偶一不愼而禍作矣。</p>
<p>最足為交通阻塞之害者，厥惟裝貨之車輛。小之如老虎車小車，大之為裝貨汽車及塌車。老虎煨小車車身雖小，而其所裝之貨物，常越出於車身之外，以一二人推挽之，速率不高，阻滯更易，復與人力車同行於馬路之旁，遇有汽車電車駛過，三車相會，最易發生危險，此其一。塌車旣重且笨，挽運已覺費力，橫亘於馬路之中，常阻其他車輛之進行。加以木質鐵輪，路面之摩擦更深，行動之蠕緩特甚。近見工部局對於此等塌車，收捐特重，而於改裝汽輪之塌車，收捐較低，蓋亦寓禁於征之意也。此其二。裝貨汽車盛行以來，為圖裝貨多而費用經濟起見，車身日以龐大，路面較狹之處，一車之外，不能容他車，夫以目前寬度不勻之馬路，行駛汽車電車人力各車，已覺狹隘不堪，再加以碩大無朋之裝貨汽車，疾馳狂駛，交通安得而不阻塞，肇禍安得而絕跡，此其三。</p>
<p>故以為安全運動之實際收效，尚應從路政車輛各方面整頓入手，否則行人無論如何小心，禍變之來，誠有非常情所可逆料者，如行於人行道上，安全宜莫逾於此矣，然亦有因汽車駕駛不良，或酗酒失眠或道路狹窄，竟駛上人行道以肇禍矣，此豈可謂為「死者自不小心。」又如指揮交通，不待車輛通過完畢，即另放他路車輛，欲止不得，欲行危險，此豈可謂為「不服從交通指揮」之過。他如自行車常自後如鷹掠而過行人車輛之前，驀然不及防；汽車之追越電車，與電車乘客上下之際，嗚嗚然傍電車飛揚而去，使車客欲上不是，欲下不得，而固無如之何也。南京路浙江路之東北口，路面旣窄，車輛又多，而行人常佇立於路旁，亟圖穿越，稍一不愼，禍患可立作，此則行人之過也，類此者尚多。至行人與駕駛者心理上之錯誤，如一以為車必讓人，一以為人必讓車，兩者各如是存心，互不知讓，終必有肇禍者矣。</p>
<p>尚有不能已於言者，則為顧全行人安全之中，力謀顧及多數市民交通之便利，如果為道路狹窄或修理馬路，實有限制何種車輛行駛之必要，亦應先從裝貨車輛之行駛或時間上入手，而不應限制公眾所藉以代步致遠之人力車；即除貨車以外，尚有限制人力車之必要時，其至大限度，亦應許其單程交通，不能全部限制，而使市民心理，惟有坐汽車者纔能無往而不通之印象。尤望指揮交通者能處處出以善意指導之態度，敏愼將事，亦無濫用職權，使市民對於維持交通滿意之中感覺慊然也。</p>
<p>値此交通安全運動週之始，怵於去歲車輛肇禍之多，我人衷誠期望安全運動獲收宏效；而本文所陳，僅以見因果之繁複，有待於多方面之改進。至於目前，要在行人與車輛以及負有指揮交通責任者，三方合作。</p>
<h3>東京贊助封鎖政策</h3>
<p>（東京）朝日新聞今日稱，東京日政府完全贊助天津日軍當局封鎖英當租界之態度政策與計畫、日政府不放棄務使日本目的得以實現之政策、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）據日方半官消息、今日內閣集議、決定維護天津日軍當局之舉動、即外相有田向內閣報吿謂英方因天津封鎖事件提出交涉後、渠答以此事應就地解決、渠並勸英政府採取愼重態度、而於從根本上解決此問題、時與日方合作、英方對於天津日方行為表示扼腕、並要求說明日軍司令所發封鎖租界之佈吿文、渠吿以未曾接到天津當局之正式報吿、但覺此事應就地辦理云、半官方面得悉內閣並造成對於此事進行政府之已定政策、聞內閣於聽取陸相板埠之報吿後、乃有上述之決定、傳說板垣聲稱、天津日當局已以審愼方法與堅强決心、採行各種適當之計劃、（十六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>中國體育敎育槪况（一）　學校體育編印敎材</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）中國體育推行於學校社會者、雖有數十年之歷史、而近十年實爲發展過程中之重要時期、略舉其經過之大要、及此后推動方針如次、</p>
<p>體育行政　我國體育、初無所謂行政、迨二十一年八月、敎部召集首屆全國體育會議、通過國民體育實施方案、經修正公布后、體育之意義、漸爲一般人所重視、敎部乃於同年十月組織體育委員會、爲體育最高設計機構、繼於同年十一月設置主管體育之督學、負執行及視導之責、翌年復令全國各省市一津組織體育委員會、添設主管體育之督學及體育股、以求全國行政組織之健全、而謀推行之順利、所可惜者、一部份省市、因專門人村之難得、未能切實遵行、致難作普遍一致之發展、其已設委員會及督學者、則顯呈不同之景象、</p>
<p>學校體育　學校之有體育、雖開風氣之先、但實際上各校體育、每因人而異、不易產生一致之效果、待二十年十一月、敎部體育委員會組織各級學校體育課程討論委員會、訂佈各級學校體育課程標準、始稍有原則上之規定、時間方法、漸趨統一、二十三年、乃更進步求敎材之劃一、聘請專家、開始編輯小學及高初中男女生體育敎授細目、於二十五年內相繼出版、以供各校之需求、然學校體育之目標、決非每週二三小時之課業所能滿足、必須設法從日常生活中養成學生運動習慣而後可、敎部乃於二十六年頒布中小學校强迫課外運動暫行辦法、施行以來、成效頗著、　　社會體育　敎部爲謀發展民眾體育、會通令各省市縣普設體育塲、供給民衆運動機會、提倡體育競賽、並於二十年四月、公布民衆業餘運動會辦法大綱、規定各縣每年至少應舉行一次、以資提倡、一時各地運動風氣、爲之大開、但近數年來、因外患交迫、此種活動、似巳銳减、亟應設法維持、而農工商界之體育、尤有積極提倡鼓勵之必要、</p>
<p>體育競賽　十年前、除少數學校（且以敎會學校爲多）之外、極少運動競賽之舉行屬於全國性者尤少、十九年浙江省政府舉辦博覽會於西湖、同時發起全國運動大會、結果圓滿、政府深覺有提倡之意義、遂由敎部訂頒全國運動大會舉行辦法、規定每一年分別在首都及其他省市輪流舉行、二十二年及二十四年先后在首都及上海舉辦之第五第六兩屆即依此辦法而行、</p>

<p>金市穩定　變動亦狹</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、變動範圍愈形狹小、祇有八元差度、但市勢頗形堅穩、蓋某金號（代投機商）與錢兌業（代殷富）多頭心思仍濃、加以證券帮已中止拋塞、尙且稍有納胃、唯中途因銀權帮與現金號、競相塞出、一度會退二千五百八十二元、終因多方拉抬、又回上至二千五百九十元收盤。結果軋漲五元、交易尙旺、約千兩左右、銀樓飾金仍無變動、海關金與中英純金等一致上升、</p>
<p>烚赤僅軋漲五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開上數日多頭出籠之證券帮、突來復進、因之售者均懷親望、價遂逐漸抬高、九時四十分開市即做高五元、證券帮進銀樓帮五十兩、價二千五百九十元、時九十元限價賣戶頗多、且證券帮已止進旁觀、價遂立見回下、瞬即降低四元、現金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、價八十六元、繼之銀樓帮亦吐予金號五十兩、價八十四元、後銀樓帮又售予金號五十兩、價八十五元、此後散戶多頭亦來脫售、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價八十二元、嗣後某錢兌業忽趁低力吸、潛勢復轉上漲、進銀樓帮及現金號等共三百三十兩、價遂拾高至八十六元、不久又進現金號五十兩、價八十四元、後錢兌業互做五十兩、價八十七元、將近午刻、銀樓帮力塞予金號五十兩、八十五元爲午收價、午後初開平靜、首由金號互做五十兩、價與午收相同、仍爲八十五元、嗣後某金號代投機商吸收頗力、市價頻頻上提、某金號進現金號五十兩、價八十七元五角、繼而錢兌業亦進現金號元十兩、價八十八元、三時三刻某金號再進銀樓帮五十兩價九十元、此後賣者轉稀、某金號雖抬高全九十一元、但仍難獲對手、延至四時未見續有做開、放晚收價仍作二千五百九十元、結果軟之隔昨軋漲五元、全天祇八元美度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千六百元、收進一一千五百八十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤漲落頗平、致仍無變化、大同行懸原價二百十三元、新同行爲二百六十一元、收進二百五十五元</p>
<p>純金又漲半便士</p>
<p>上五日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊續疲、故每盎司又漲半辦士、計達七鎊八先令五辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦續高至一千二百十一元九角、掛牌海關金亦升二厘、計爲二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨昂三角、計一千二百〇七元二角、</p>

<h3>糧食　麥銷活躍　粉市反呆</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨粉市、客銷自天津租界封鎖後、大帮去化之華北區、巳受重大之打擊、恐一時難以恢復原狀、惟南洋帮銷化、頗不寂寞、蓋各廠可儘量供給、市面亦不若前兩日之緊俏、統市成交約有三四萬包、二號粉續開四元八角之匯劃、市面暫告平站、聞洋粉交易平淡、售價亦鮮重大出入、麵粉今日出口、有七千包運塘沽、又五百包運往青島、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日新小麥來源、續有南京一帶車麥運到、但爲數不多、貨方均以產價頻升、成本高昂、大牛上棧待價而沽、昨聞汕頭帮忽有搜辦、本街磨坊與行號囤戶亦有指染、市面又見向榮、價開六元六角至四角、成交共有十車之數、目下滬廠存麥充足、洋麥又有一船將到、故市塲人心、尙艱過好、市面開展、大致端節後、方有熱烈之望　　米價仍見上升</p>
<p>杜粳　昨日各帮來源河下貨仍以某方在閔行攔阻、未有到頭、而車輪包子常錫猶難搬運、僅蘇同崑帮近三千包、久旱週餘、陡下甘霖、人心歡安、故早市開手形勢有回軟之象、詎市難預測、迄午忽有南方大辦客尖、同時本街作客乘機跟蹤暢納各貨、致一時情形又見混沌、頓呈緊佾、囤戶隨風捉影、亦相互授受、喊聲屢起、故結果大局市面、反疲呈秀、若常粳特高貨開出十九元八角、重固高薄亦開十九元三角、各貨行情、悉較提升二三角、</p>
<h3>匯價平準之轉變　（續一·一日）</h3>
<p>— 盛慕傑</p>
<p>（二）平準基金成立後的匯市</p>
<p>外匯平凖基金成立後，暗市塲形勢頓變，匯市不振氣象，一掃而空，如三月八日很顯明的外匯售戶變多，九日供給者愈多，向以吸收著稱的天津帮亦有拋售，暗市行市由八·一二五與一五·八四三七五漲到十日之八·四〇六二五與一六·四三七五，以後　回落，但至十七日，市塲發沈平凖基金初次之活動，市價立即停於八·二五之關口，匯豐銀行並表示願隨時按此價供售外匯。嗣後，天津方面稱有購入，商業上的需要，源源不絕，尤其是棉花輸入方面爲數甚大，直到三月底爲止，匯市情況，一方面是交易繁盛，一方面是行程平穩，不過照例供應需要，別無波折。但進一步觀察，則輸入商對於外匯需要的慾壑好似無底洞似的，而出口匯票則稀如鳳毛麟角，結果市塲上需要者是多數的，而供給者則是唯一的，則是大可注意的了。</p>
<p>到四月份，外匯暗市現化是長期穩定於八·二五便士的水凖，不過期貨方面則稍有變動，如上半月匯市近遠期價幾抵於平，四月與七月期間的差額不過三十二份之一便士，一個月的掉期差額祇一百二十八份之一便士，但到月底的一週一個月掉期差價英匯是六十四份之一便士，美匯是三十二份之一分。四月份外匯平準基金究竟供給多少外匯是無法知道，但在月底一週外棉結價達二十萬鎊至三十萬鎊之巨。匯市雖是平穩，可是對於匯市上的壓力是很大的。</p>
<p>轉入五月份，則因日僞組織的華與商業銀行成立，日本跟行和天津帮暗中扒吸現期貨英美兩匯，差不多每天參加市塲上沽動，匯豐等銀行對於洋行少數結款，還肯供給一但對巨額結軟，頗不肯供應，扒結者轉向期貨進攻，亦難如願。這檯情形在四月底已見端倪，至五月初更甚·於是期貨的趨勢遂緊軟，現貨差額最大的時候，套利除佣約合月息八釐六毫左右。後因供源轉暢，期貨方才與現貨逐漸接近。可知外匯上所受到的壓力，一天大似一天，長此以八二。五便士去應付，實屬。</p>
<p>（三）八·二五平準價底觀察</p>
<p>上海暗市外匯的掛牌價，匯豐銀行自二十七年六月即掛八便士，市面上實際則較高。今年在平準基金設立前的行市維持八·一二五，平準基金成立後，即釘住八·二五。不過八二五的平凖價，是市塲上在三月十七日所發覺的，是不是即爲平凖基金委員會所認爲眞的是適合中國經濟情形底水凖匯率，不敢臆測。但平凖基金會所以以八便士二五來維持供應市面的最大原因，恐怕還是適應當時的環境，和當時的匯市趨勢，並沒有考慮到匯市上的壓力。假定說，平準會如考慮到匯市上的壓力，那一定是要使匯市在八便士及以上的行市維持整個的一年，因自二十七年六月以迄現在，恰巧一年。</p>
<p>匯市上的壓力由前面兩章對於匯市的觀察，大要可說是貿易上的需要和日僞的套買。而貿易上的需要，亦問接地是使日本獲得外匯。試加分析如下：</p>
<p>關於日僞的套買，日本所採取的方法有多種，第一，江海關現在差不多受制於日軍，海關稅收完全存在日本　行，則它以法幣易取外匯是屬意中事。第二，在廣泛的華中區以日鈔和軍用票强換法幣到上海來購外匯。第三，以僞組織的銀行所發行的僞鈔來調取法幣，套買外匯，最先的事例是華北「中國聯合準備銀行，」最近的事例是「華與商業銀行。」僞鈔根本是無準備的，則無論僞鈔對於法幣價值的比率是如何低，祇要有價值，便可套買外匯。所以這三方面對於法幣的匯價底壓力是非常之大。</p>
<p>關於貿易上的需要，今年首四個月的入超如以鎊計約爲四百五十萬英鎊，內中上海一埠的入超約計二百四十萬英鎊，佔入超總額二分之一。則對對於上海外匯暗市的壓力底强大，亦可想而知。前面會說貿易上需要亦是使得日本獲得外匯，事實上確是如此。第一，上海由日本。朝鮮。台灣。和「滿洲」的進口，本年首四個月共值美金一千六百萬元，而由上海輸往上述各地的共計美金三百萬元，無疑的這一千三白萬的差額，當然求之於上海外匯暗市。第二，上海麵粉銷往「滿洲」的數量很大，而其原料——小麥底進口係來自美國和澳大利，所支付者是外匯，而紛之收入是日圓·法幣·和「滿幣」。第三，棉花的進口佔到上海進口總值的百分之二十，但是百分之七十五的進口棉花是上海日本紗廠所耗用，這又間接予日本以獲得外匯的方法。　（未完）</p>

<p>本棉交易仍淸、惟日商裕豐廠續進美種打包花四百件、其他廠家無甚交易、惟印度棉同業買賣復見暢盛、此項生意轉輾售予日廠抵解交易也、故售價日增本棉通州花已到九十元棧交、大中集竟賣一百十元、此由於崎形發展之價格、可說目棉業有史以來未見之悄况、蘇北來源仍少、碼頭到僅下沙花一百〇八包、茲將現棉悄形錄左、</p>

<h3>獲得夫婦生活幸福的秘鑰</h3>
<p>在醫學與生理學進步的現代，愛情的秘室，已經給了我們一個鑰匙，允許我們隨時可以進去看看這個眞理之宮了。在各人身體內的「荷爾蒙」，由一個機官裏注出，影響到別個機官，影響到個人生活作用的全部，並在兩性生活中，更影響到異性的一切，而異性也是很需要道種影響的。所以在兩性生活的觀點上，女的不過是男的一部分，而男的也不過是女的一部分。男女相合起來才能成一個整體的完人。</p>
<p>在兩性生活中，兩人的聯合不僅能滿足兩方相需的渴望，並從這種聯合中能够產生一種『神妙的創作』。這種創作，不僅指男女相愛所生的子女而言。且指因男女完全融合而生超物質的種種實體在內。雙方給情絲所系以後，他們就成爲新奇的東西，和分離時是絕不相同了。</p>
<p>一個靑年和閨女給萬能的愛情引力所激動，好像在眼前另有一種廣大而美麗的世界，可以加增他們各種的能力，而不是平常過獨居生活的人所能計量的，這是多麼光榮偉大而幸福。</p>
<p>可是世間男女畢竟幸福的人太少了。大多數人均沉淪在痛苦中，其中原因雖多，但給英國大作家斯托潑女士一言就道穿了。她說：『假使正正當當的來硏究婚烟的各方面，是可以成就不朽的事業，有些人也會有過這樣的研究，但都徘徊在變態的迷朦之間，因此忽略了健康的熱情人之的需要』她的意思是說健康熱情是。兩性生活幸福的秘鑰。</p>
<p>世間男女他們因不知道這個秘鑰，不於婚前自凟遺精，即於婚後荒淫過度，或更尋花問柳縱慾斵傷，致精血虧損。因此凡健忘，失眠，耳鳴，眼花，腰酸，背痛，早洩，陽萎，久婚不育等症遂相繼而起，如久爲夫者因不能盡其責任，必爲妻怨恨，兩性生活遂陷於痛苦境地。唯一補救之法卽服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，因此藥於服後二十四小時卽能生精補腎健腦活血。藥性和平效力最大，上述病症於短期內可保證治療，惟患者如有遺精，則必須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』以鞏固精關制止遺洩，能開源節流，收效必更爲神速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯是女性美的要點</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>酥胸軟臂玉樣裝，</p>
<p>豐乳肥臀最風光，</p>
<p>怪底人人多熱愛，</p>
<p>如心合意選新郞。</p>
<p>除了已被廢棄的舊式盲目婚烟之外。現代男子的選擇配偶，他們無不以對方的「體格健全」爲第一要着。至於面貌的如何？學問的怎樣？以及品行的如何還不過是次要問題，此稱見解，在我們醫學家的立塲看來，覺得很爲扼要，蓋人生的整個事業，家庭安樂，以及子嗣的强弱，無不與體格有直接簡接關係，如妻子的體格健全，那麼她不但可以帮助丈夫創業興家，卽在夫婦之間的私生活上，她具有熱烈的濃情，亦可使丈夫快樂歡愉，精神上得到無限的快慰，家庭間充滿着喜氣，生育着伶俐的子女，其幸福必無量。</p>
<p>可是話得說回來。女子的體格，怎樣才算健全？關於這一點，有許多人還沒有充分的認識，但在聰明的男子看來，這是一望而知的事情，蓋女性的體格健全與吾，只要看她們的乳臀兩部即得，如女性的乳峯現高聳而有彈性狀態，臀部豐腴而圓潤者。即可斷知其生殖腺卵巢機能必健，新陳代謝作用旺盛，全身都充滿着新生細胞，自然毫無暗病，反之，如乳峯萎瘟，臀部瘦削，健美喪失者，那麼她不是曾犯自凟束胸，便是患有月經不調，白帶不感諸症，雖有如花如玉的面貌，亦爲時代男子所鄙棄，其命運必非常悲慘！欲謀補救，祗有信賴科學，據世界婦科名醫及余經騐。均公認以服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑配製精良，服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調經種子，於圾短期內即能使乳峯聳起，臀部豐腴，紅潤面頰，長駐靑春。</p>
<h3>遺精可使形神枯槁</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>由於醫學昌明，我們已知道在內分泌中的生殖腺，對於我們的身體至關重要。這種生殖腺內分泌，在幼年時，則藉血液之循環而灌溉全身，主持我人身體狀貌與重的發育。一至春情發動期間，這種生殖腺內分泌更有一部分注入於精囊，以司生殖作用。若靑年無智，因這種腺體刺激於精神和肉體所發生的性的衝動而不能自主，或犯上自凟，或早婚縱慾，致繼起遺精，則此種腺體勢必因大量的消耗而枯竭，於是發育作用停滯，新陳代謝减退，雖已成年，而全身一似童稚。更面黃肌瘦，形神枯槁，年齡正輕，而已呈衰老狀態了。</p>
<p>所以靑年人一有遺精症，必須及早根治，若因循失治，或更變成滑精漏精，不特上述症象難免，恐怕凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，精力渙散，精薄不育等症更相繼沓來。此種靑年，將在情塲中因形神枯槁，體貌不揚，每爲異性所棄，陷入失戀慘境，即在婚後的夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿，家庭生活，更將痛苦！同時在今日競爭萬分劇烈的社會裏，亦只有優勝劣敗，被淘汰而已！欲謀補救，必須服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得酣眠，遺精可於當夜立止，若因遺精縱慾而已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，能繼續服用，必可早日恢復美滿健康，而百病霍然，患者若親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>淋濁發赤腫痛之特治法</h3>
<p>淋病在急性時，其龜頭及包皮，因淋毒的刺㦸而致發災腫痛，爲急性時恒遇之症狀。患者之尿道口周圍部分，每必發赤腫痛，此種症象之輕重，恒與淋菌之强烈與否爲。其毒性强烈者，則尚有尿道口之下部，陰莖繫帶之兩側面，以致全部包皮，皆呈水腫而有光澤狀之腫脹，並伴有疼痛，但是此種腫脹瀦溜之漿液，與陰囊水腫相類，並非膿汁也。病狀既然已至如此地歩，其毒菌之侵襲已展至副尿道，林妥而氏腺及濾胞內，如其此等場所果被毒侵襲，則每於此等場所發生粟粒大乃至豌荳大之腫脹硬結，用觸診法即可觸知。因而尿道腔被此硬結障礙而狹小，排尿益感困難。</p>
<p>要偵察此等病情，當用新式尿道鏡作精細檢查，俾知病的真相。然後用德國濾淋平流電療法，直接向病灶透射蓋副尿道內之淋菌，絶對不能用局部手術可以扑滅，惟有濾淋電療，始可深入病灶。一方更用化學療法，及特製自家菌苗爲注射劑。如此在一星期內，則所有炎腫症象，完全消退，二星期，其尿道硬結，亦可消除，恢復原狀，此種療法，爲余十數年來之經騐結晶。</p>
<p>科目</p>
<p>兼治梅毒，横痃，下疳，及無痛苦新法割除包皮。</p>

<h3>補救滬市輔幣恐慌　財部已有根本辦法　將准發行分幣券流通　商號代價券中止發行　南京路商聯會徵詢辦法</h3>
<p>上海市塲銅幣及銅元、爲奸商牟利搜羅後、致異常缺乏、各業零數交易深感不便、上海市商會曾電財政部請求迅予補救、今財部已准新輔幣運滬接濟、新聲社記者昨再由銀行界探悉、財政部對上海銅幣之缺乏、已定有根本救濟辦法、將准銀行發行分幣券、與應付內地銅元缺乏辦法相同、惟內地之分幣券、歸省銀行或地方銀行發行、上海方面、則是吾由中中交農四行發行、一時尙無法探悉、但中央銀行上海分行、對新輔幣之運滬、及發行分幣券流通等、均謂未得重慶總行之電令、至於各商號之自行發行代價券計劃、因財政部已有補救辦法、故均將中止發行、本市商業中心之南京路商界聯合會、以自銅元及一分幣减少後、市民商界、兩感困難、擬印行臨時券一種、分發南京路各商號、以資零找之用、一俟政府新輔幣到滬、此項臨時券即行取消、該會爲鄭重起見、昨已分函各商號徵詢意見、其在微詢函中分「極感需要」·「尙可應付」，等項、請各商號於三日內查照答復、以便決定、至此項臨時券之名稱、是吾爲代價券、或其他名稱、尙待斟酌決定、自銅元缺乏浪潮展開後、各馬路公團、曾徇商號之請求、有發行臨時代價券之籌議、惟各方評議不一、蓋設被好宄冒仿朦混、反多流弊、善後爲難、第商人團體、力謀減少商人困難、固足致欽佩者也、</p>

<h3>哥侖比亞大學教授　游歷華西印象　盛讚中國人民精神偉大　到處發現長期抗戰決心</h3>
<p>哥侖比亞大學敎投奧却特、係遠東事件名著作家、近偕其夫人游歷中國之西部與西北部後、上週取道上海返美、奧敎授近在重慶時、曾向美國發播音演說、陳述一九三二年中國與今日中國之逈然不同、及中國繼續抵抗日本侵略之能力云、數日前、本人自香港來華西川省、冀發現遭受重大損失之國家、如何能抵抗侵略者、今乃在此間重慶發現共答覆矣、重慶昔爲川省商業出口地、今突成</p>

<p>之政治中心地、棄守漢口數月之內、二十五萬人口增至五十萬以上、人口擁擠、勢所不免、刻遍處均在建造公署、住宅、工廠、與大學等房屋、造屋或建防空壕、先須用人工平地、故用搥擊鑿、除去</p>
<p>沙巖之聲</p>
<p>不絕於耳、街道間旣有汽車、人力車與肩輿、今復有運送必耍建築材料之苦力與手拉車、以故行人與車輛陸續不斷、川·滇·黔·諸省、不僅爲政治活動之根據地、且係工業革命之區、其礦產與工業富源、今在考查中、自戰區忽遽移出之工廠、亦在重建中、本人已參觀若干工廠、對彼等克服不能排除的困難之態度、</p>
<p>頗感驚異</p>
<p>須知工廠之設備、乃跋涉千萬里而運來者、同時並鼓勵手工業、補助工廠工業之不足、今不欲使聽衆具中國已解決其經濟困難之印象、中國一方面繼賴此三省之自給經濟、他方面則招他省人民入內、俾供給軍隊之給養、輸出過剩產物、樹立外滙、而自內部重建不能旦夕吿成之新經濟、中國且須從外界獲得較目前</p>
<p>更大援助</p>
<p>本人發現重慶人民之精神、較物質上之成就、更獲深刻之印象、彼等無談及讓步者、亦無談及媾和者、到處所遇、均係樂觀與無限期抗戰之平靜決心、余對於中國各界人民之偉大精神實不能以言詞贊揚之自戰爭中產生之團結、爲余一九三二年上决到華時所未見、各省畛域、已全泯滅、壯烈强有力之國家精神、正在鍜鍊中、吾人之感覺、厥爲中國乃五萬萬人民而拒不被征服之國家云、</p>

<h3>春繭運滬被阻　絲廠完全停車　拋出六月期絲無法依約解貨　「華中公司」圖獨霸中國絲業</h3>
<p>自「華中蠶絲公司」放棄鄉鎮收繭、准許上海廠商向鄉鎭設行收繭後、各廠爲維持營業計、冒險向各地收買春繭、今江浙各地繭汛已過、繭行先後停秤、廠商收得之繭、準備裝車運滬之際、突爲「華中公司」所阻止、經各廠商向「華中公司」提出交涉之後、初允俟該公司總經理日人由日返滬後、再行辦理、今該日籍總經理雖己返滬、而被阻之繭、仍未放行、</p>
<p>滬市各廠　被迫停車</p>
<p>租界區域內之繅絲工廠、共有三十六家、已完全開工、後因原料繭子缺乏、被迫先後停車、原擬自春繭上市後開車、令因收得之繭被阻、且存繭業已吿罄、除怡和·越興·福綸·振綸·上海·等數家、勉强開工外、其餘各廠、均已完全停車、而勉强維持開車之各廠、所有原料、爲數有限、預料本月底以前、如春繭運滬問題、仍不解決、則上上海全部絲廠、將完全被迫停車、</p>
<p>拋出期絲　無法解貨各絲廠依照過去習慣、向經營出口華絲之洋行拋售春繭上市後之期絲、俟各廠收得春繭後、繅絲分別依的解貨、上海租界內各廠拋售六月份及七月份期絲、爲數頗多、今因春繭運滬被阻、致各廠無法開車繅絲、到期應解之期絲、無法照解、於是廠商與洋行發生小糾葛、惟各廠商因事出無奈、且爲人力所不能抗、故洋行方面允於春繭放行後、再行解貨、日期不得不展延，</p>
<p>企圖獨霸　中國絲業</p>
<p>中國年來之繅絲業頗有復興氣象、日人對此異常嫉忌、今江浙產絲區域、旣爲佔領、自然儘量壓迫、企圖獨霸中國之蠶絲事業、此决阻撓春繭運滬、即爲其政策之一、現「華中公司」除將無錫各廠、設法開工繅絲外、並進一步圖刦奪嘉興杭州海寗各地之絲廠、名爲合作、實爲攫取、同時並圖壟斷歐美絲市塲、</p>

<p>自八一三戰事以後、十六舖以南之碼頭浮筒、因被封鎖、不能前往停泊、浦東方面、楊家渡之太古碼頭。鴻興碼頭·英商隆茂碼頭·及以東之其昌棧·籃烟囱等碼頭、已恢復停靠、海關浮筒自一號至八號、三十六號至四十四號、仍被佔軍用、</p>
<p>船隻進口　較前增多</p>
<p>因近來裝儎洋麥·外棉之進口船隻、較前增多、對停泊一事、浮筒遂發生缺乏、有時竟因碼頭浮筒無隙、乃在吳淞口外等候三四日之久、方始進口起卸貨物、此項損失、亦屬不貲、</p>

<p>工部局碼　頭極擁擠</p>
<p>至以外難工部局之碼頭言之、戰前祗停靠小輪及駁船而已、今則行駛長江下游各口之船隻、均靠此碼頭、故該局在五馬路外灘、特設碼頭捐務處、專事管理碼頭事宜、故近來浦江中浮筒及碼頭、兩感不敷應用、航業界頗受困頓、鎭海擊落日機之高射機關槍手、建功甚偉、浙省府黃主席備致嘉獎、特犒賞國幣一萬元、以資獎勵、</p>

<p>哨兵示意係駛往虹口捕房、事下橋時、行駛頗速、突有兩日哨兵躍登駕駛座旁左右路板上、右方之哨兵以雙手緊據駕駛輪、左方之哨兵亦俯身入車窗、傾向駕駛輪、李里左手乃離輪、將其推開、該哨兵遂仍直立踏板上、時李里推速率器於第二檔、右方哨兵推駕駛輪左右旋轉、車遂成曲綫形、循百老滙路行駛李里</p>

<p>前往捉奸、但廳迅速避去、未爲所獲、僅見魯志成在於室內、當時曹氏因憒魯之誘其夫、曾掌其頰二下、乃去年十一月十九日、龐慶實忽向老閘捕房報吿、謂妻曹氏與魯志成發生奸情、現正闢室於遠東飯店三百二十號房間幽叙、請予拘捕、當由捕房飭探馳往、果在室內將曹氏及魯拘獲、而床上</p>

<h3>入桂行程（續上期）</h3>
<p>— 慤厂</p>
<p>護照領得後，向德輔道亞力山打行頂樓法領事館，繳納簽證費一元，聲請加簽，簽證後就可生效了。這種護照，在海防僅能停留十四日，過期也要由當地殷實商號代向警署申請延期。吾則受罰甚重。到了海防，先乘火車至河內，距離一〇二公里，二小時可達，票價二等越幣二元一角三等一元二角五分。由河內改乘越南國有鐵道北段直通車至越南邊境同登，距離一六七公里，五十時可達，票價頭等九元七角八分，二等六元五角二分三等二元七角，四等一元一角三分，均爲越幣。在普通一般人看來，要往龍州，當然應該在同登下車，可是一來諒山有較好的旅館飯店，可　　宿，同登不過是邊境一續，盒宿全不易解決：二則龍諒長途汽車，是自諒山啟程，在諒山改秉汽車，也比同登便利：所以還是在諒山先下車來得便當多了。河內到諒山的車票，頭等八元八角八分，二等五元九角二分，三等二元四角四分，四等一元〇二分，全是越幣。由諒山到廣西龍州，計七十三公里，中送經過同登，鎭南關，隘口，憑祥，那堪，鴨仔灘，等處。下午二時（越南時間）較國內時間遲一小時，自諒山開行，下午七時（國內時間）就可以達到龍州，票價桂幣六元六角四分，（每桂幣二元合國幣一元，）免費行李，每人二十公斤，過重每十公斤，加桂幣七角八分八厘。到了龍州，卽可乘廣西公路局的長途汽車，去南寗。南寗以上公路，就可經柳州到桂林，或者是經大塘到貴陽了。廣西省公路局的汽車，每日在龍州南寗各開一决，上午五時自龍州開出，下午四時左右，就可以到南寗，票價每人國幣十一元二角一分，免費行李，也是以二十公斤爲限，過重行李每十公斤的納費國幣一元。此外由海防至龍州，也有直達的公路，可以僱小包車去的。防龍全程，小包車六七小時就可到了。假如早晨八點鐘自海防出發，在諒山休息午餐，午後二時再自諒山出發，傍晚五時，就可以抵達龍州。不過一部小包車要越幣九十元左右。</p>
<p>按照上面所說的，現在到廣西去，實在不能算是不便，不過要注意幾點：　到了海防入境時，應將護照送到法警局去簽證並且耍報明異日出境的途程，因爲到了出境時，前後必須要相符。假如途程有改變，一定要請警署重行簽證。　隨帶物件如絲，綢，呢，布，衣料，繡件，化裝品和其他一切新買的物品，認爲有納稅可能性的，不妨儘量檢出，歸在一起，等到到海關時，自己指出來，靜候關員審定，是不是要納稅，這個樣子，一則可以免罰，二則其餘行李也可以希望檢查從簡一點，千萬不要密裹在被褥等處，希圖混過，因爲要是一旦被查出來，不單要扣留行李，還要受到很嚴厲的處罰。　在諒山貿長途汽車票的時候一定要把護照拿出來，請站上看，不然也要備帮長的證明書，　車到同登要下車辦理護照簽字出境手牘，過鎮南關就是廣西省，廣西省對汎督辦署鎭南關分驕要檢騐護照，又再過四公里到隘口鎭，有龍州關分卡，要檢騐行李，到了龍州還要到對汎督辦署簽騐護照，方可以入摬，這種種的手續也要注意，不可忘記了。（完）</p>
<h3>旅行通問</h3>
<p>翁玉祥君問赴閩情形：</p>
<p>答　上海至福州原有怡和公司之利生輪及其他葡商輪船行駛，票價官艙三十元房艙二十元統艙十一元，近各公司輪船均在停駛中，間或有船行駛，唯班期絕少。以是赴閩者或可取道溫州，經靑田，麗水，龍泉，而入閩省浦城，再由浦城循閩省公路赴福州。唯凡赴溫州者均須持有當地舖保，　赴閩信件亦由浙省轉往的十餘日可達。</p>
<p>張洛　君問赴江西大庚縣</p>
<p>路由：</p>
<p>答　如欲取道汕頭赴江西大庚，其行程可參閱本刋第十一期，抵曲江後可循公路至大庚汽車費的十餘元。　內地旅行，携帝地圖，頗多不便，至於少數之課本書籍則無問題，牛痘，防疫及身份證書均需要，其身份證書應由本人供職機關或肄業學校出具，方爲有效</p>
<p>楊振東　君問港昆間飛機</p>
<p>及港防間輪船情形。。</p>
<p>答　港昆間並無直達飛機，先由港乘法航或帝航飛機至越南河內，票價爲英金十四鎊由河轉乘歐亞或中航機赴滇，票價越幣九十五元及九十元，免費行李祇有五公斤；亦須受檢查，至於取道越南赴滇者，應備具護照後方准購票，　由漲至防可乘法國遠東航業公司之小廣東輪每月十，二十，三十日由港開，三等票價越幣三十三元，四等港幣十二元，二日可達。　抵防時對於所帶新製中裝及童裝衣服，無須納稅。</p>

<p>上海特辑</p>
<h3>上海旅行事業（續）（完）  周思忠</h3>
<p>美國國：美國旅行事業極爲發達，以其國家當庶，人民生活安定，對於旅行事業允感興趣故耳。每年美人游歷各國所耗之金錢，實較其他各國人士之游美者銷耗之數目爲大。在美國一國言，旅行事業對其國家固係入超，而在全世界言則確係調劑世界經濟之惟一國家矣。其旅行機關一爲運通銀行（Ameriean　FxpressCo．），亦係私設公司，其組織及事業與英國之通濟降，大致相似；一爲國立公園，由鐵路方面出資經營凡在都市商務會內，均有嚮導局（Information　Burean）之設立，專謀外國游客之便利，以咨招攬此種無形輸出生意。</p>
<p>法國：法國極重視旅行事業，每年不惜以一百二十萬美金之巨額，專作國外宣傳經費，近又在政府之內，增設國務决長，專司其事，以資提倡而謀發展。依照法國官方統計：一九三七年各國之往法國游覽者，計有九千萬人，而若輩在法所銷耗之金錢，的達六萬萬元。其宣傳力量之大，可以想見。至其旅行機關：一爲觀光局，乃由政府及交通部出資所經營者；一爲旅行聯盟會，係由各地方機關組織而成，專事硏究關於旅行之事業。</p>
<p>德國：德國之旅行機關，乃由政府及鐵路銀行輪船公司等出資所經營者。其營業爲發售車船客票，運送行李，兌換外幣等項。每年向國外印送之印刷品，的二百五十萬册，具見其對於旅行事業之宣傳，不遺餘力；又凡赴德游歷者，可免納護照簽字費，免微登陸稅及其他特稅，故每年往德旅客之總數，竟能超過一百三十萬人之鉅。一九三六年世界運動會在柏林舉行，各國游客已達一百六十二萬餘人；但决年（一九三七）赴德旅客之總數，又增至一百八十九萬人，並不比世運時之人數减少，足見德國旅行事業之發達，實可驚人矣。</p>
<p>瑞士：按瑞士一國出產卽然無多，工商事業又不逮大國之閎規，則其政府之經費果何所依靠耶？此旅行事業遂爲政府所極端重視者矣。歐州各國，風景以瑞士爲首，各國人士之往瑞士游覽者，亦年有增進，瑞政府之經費，卽大半有頓於斯，故極力爲國外游侶謀便利，凡旅客之赴瑞士者，莫不特予便利，如護照母庸加簽，鐵路可予特價，舉凡能便利於旅客之種種優待辦法，莫不盡力行之。旅行機關有國立觀光局，乃由政府及各都市出姿經營者，其對外賓之誘致，允努力異常。茲據非官方報吿，赴瑞士游客年可達三百五十萬人。</p>
<p>其他如加拿大，蘇，意，瑞典，土耳其，波蘭，希臘，和蘭，墨西哥，紐絲蘭諸國，莫不有旅行機關之設立，其提倡旅行之宗旨，亦無不同，特其規模之大小有別耳。</p>
<p>我國旅行事業尙未發達　反觀我國，無論政府或國民對於旅行事業，均絕少注意，而於國外游侶，允不能設法招致，政府當局對於此項事業卽　重視，復尠協助，重以年來國家建設，百端待舉，對於旅行事業之協助提倡，自亦力所弗及。根據一九三一年之確實調查：美國旅客消費於各國之總數，爲五萬零二百七十五萬餘元，而中國僅得六百餘萬元，在各國中是爲最少數，其不能注意於國外之宣傳工作可姿證明，不然以我國山川之秀，物產之豐，工商業之逐步進展，凡可以吸引國外旅客者，何止此數。</p>
<p>上海之旅行事業　然而上海者，中國最繁華之商埠也，又有租界關係，故實較全國各地情形不同，而其旅行事業，亦較其他各地爲發達；但上海之有旅行機關，起始不獨非中國政府所倡辦，且非中國國人所經營，筆者任職旅行機關，雖已有七年以上之歷史，而每憶念及此，未嘗不引爲憾事；以目下言上海之旅行專業，已發展至相當稈度，戰前此事業允有極端向榮之趨勢，旅行機關爲數雖多，但其組織完備能爲中外人士所共知者，亦不過寥寥數家。其較著者當爲英國通濟隆公司，美國運通公司，日本國際觀光局及筆者現在任職之唯一中國旅行社機關中國旅行社而已。茲就上述各家在滬營業情形，分別言之：。</p>
<p>上海之各旅行機關　通濟隆，此旅行業之鼻祖也。其發明遠在九十七年以前，筆者已於首章記之。在全世界上共有分公司三百六十餘處，其來遠東，則在一九一三年左右，上海公司乃其遠東分行之總公司也。來滬亦爲最早之一家，現設於南京路四川路轉角處，其營業宗旨以發售車，船，飛機客票爲主；並代理萬國客車臥鋪要運送行李以及代理運輸事務，又發行金磅美金之旅行支票，會營國外滙兌，在中國旅行社未經創辦以前，當爲上海最完美之旅行機關，最近營業頗受戰事影響。</p>
<p>日本觀光局（Japan　Tourist　Bureau），此機關本爲商辦，後日本政府鑒於旅行事業之重要，及有利於國民經濟，乃投資協助改爲官民合辦之旅行機關。迄今已有廿六年之歷史，專爲對外增進國際間諒解與好感，並招致游日之國外游侶爲惟一使命，各國幾無不有此局之設立，在中國之各大都市商埠如上海，天津，靑島，北平，瀋陽……等處，均有分局之設。上海之有日本國際觀光局，迄茲已十有五載，其營業方針，以宜傳日本名勝，招攬游日旅客爲主旨。戰前每年由該局所招致之游日團體爲數極夥，收人極豐，迨戰事發生，生涯殊感寥落也。</p>
<p>運通公司（AmericanExpress　Co．），此美商之旅行機關也。總公司在紐的百老滙路，各國多有分行，遠東總行設於香港，在滬亦的有廿年之歷史，其營業狀况並含有銀行性質，故分爲銀行部與旅行部兩部：其銀行部份專辦對外匯兌兼辦旅行支票；旅行部份則以承攬游覽爲主。該公司之游客，大半均爲美國人，前亦兼售車輪飛機等客票，代運行李，戰後遊覽顧客减少，僅以船票爲主要業務矣。生意方面，極受影響。</p>
<p>此外尙有世界旅行社旅行顧問（Travel　Advisers），爲西人主辦之旅行社。在上海亦有相當之歷史，但其營業並不甚發達，又戰事初起時，有國際旅行社（International　Guide　Burean）者，應運而生，當然營業頗爲發達，但究係投機事業，某礎未固，遂成曇花一現。</p>
<p>中國旅行社　中國旅行社，此爲中國人經辦之旅行機關。成立於民國十二年，光陰荏苒，迄今已十有六稔矣。考其歷史初不爲久，然述其事業之歷程，及其創辦之動機，則有可得而言者：溯自歐戰以還，歐美各國旅行事業突飛猛進，其發展情形，前已爲論及，而外人在華之旅行機關，亦日臻發達，國人之出遊者，舟車行李，亦漸假手於外人，有志者憂之，斯社之創辦者，厥爲陳光甫先生。但陳先生創辦旅行社之動機何在，容有不知之者。筆者於未報吿旅行社本身紙織以前，而以此事爲開端，想亦讀者所樂聞歟。陳光甫先生乃一旅行嗜好者，三十年前即身歷中外各處，見聞廣博，頗得益於旅行，惟彼時中國卽無旅行機關之設立，如欲出外旅行，乃亦不得不向外人經辦之旅行機關請敎，筆者常思凡能創辦大事業者，其智力固必大於常人，然其創辦大事業之動機，或竟在極微小處，而能激動其大智力，以創辦大事業。觀夫陳先生之創辦旅行社乃益信，蓋陳先生之創辦旅行社也，非憑空設想，亦非見獵心喜，其故事乃竟如下述：某决陳先生復思遊歷，遂往某西人之公司接洽游程，不料陳先生向該公司之西籍職員將來意聲述後，該職員竟與一西婦娓娓情話，對於顧客並不招待，似無關重要者。陳先生對此，當無所用其惱怒，殆返後，乃有無數感想叢集腦海：『在中國自己的地方何以要有外人主辦的旅行機關？中國人何以不能爲自己人解決旅行問題？自己是中國人要游覽自己的土地，何以反要外國人來指導？外國人來到中國，中國人怎麼會沒有旅行機關去指導並招待他們？中國人是不是不會辦旅行機關？』等等問題，反復自問，凡此種種，遂廻旋於腦際，不即散去。經陳先生再三思維，遂下最大決心，而創此國人僅有之中國旅行社。本社即經成立，乃秉承陳先生抱定服務社會之主旨，以經營行旅之事。當期時也，國人見此事業新興，莫不表示忻慰，向與外人接觸者，至是乃咸歸本社，積日卽久，信用益立，即彼外人行旅之事，亦唯本社是求，經同人十餘年來之埋頭奮鬬，始有今日之基礎，戰前凡國內重要商埠城市，無不有本社服務之人，因其能相互聯繫，旅客允感使利。戰事卽起，各埠之淪爲戰區者，雖已相繼撒退，然而在西南西北等處之新興事業，更有加無已，凡足爲行旅社會國家謀福利者，無不竭力赴之。至於上海方面，在四川路設有分社；然允恐服務不周，又在愚園路，八仙橋，同孚路，霞飛路，以及永安公司內成立支社五處，專爲各區居戶謀便利。本社業務：</p>
<p>一，經售客票　舉凡國內外之火車輪船飛機公路之客票，均照定價代售，並不加收任何手續費用。</p>
<p>二，代辦護照　旅客遠行，辦理護照，向感煩難，有時不明手續，或致有誤行期，本社有鑒於此，特代客領取護照，手續力圖簡便，時間務求迅速，目下雖較爲困難，但能爲旅客助者，仍無不勉力爲之。</p>
<p>三，運送行李旅客認爲困難之事，以行李爲最。本社倫有卡車代客運送，無論輪埠至住所、，或由住所至輪埠，一切可代爲接送。</p>
<p>四，辦理貨運　本社鑒於貨物運輸，以報關手績最繁。海上報關業雖多，要皆手續不肯公開，保守特殊之秘密。本社乃特設貨運部，專代各界辦理貨物運愉及報關事件。</p>
<p>五，各地旅館及招待所　本社以通都大邑旅館之設備，固甚完美，惟內地食宿極感困難，故本社先後於各地剏設招待所。一爲設立於交通之孔道，如南京，青島，濟南，徐州，鄭州，北平，西安，南昌等處；又一則設立於風景區，如黃山，雪寶山，金華，華山，衡山等處，關於淸潔衛生，侍應周到諸端，均嚴加講求。自大戰爆發，西南西北，已成國人歸集之所，祇以開發未久，交通網綫　已吿成，而生活程度仍極困苦，故在一年以前，在西南北各交通要道，中途食宿，欲求一較良之旅社或食站者，可確言其無一能差堪人意者。本社經一年來之苦鬬，已在西南北各交通綫上沿途，均設有招待所，較爲重要之地，並開立分社，無不盡力爲行旅謀便利；苟吾人一去西南北遊歷者，當知今日之西南北，已非昔日之西南北，今日之旅行社，更非以前之旅行社矣。</p>
<p>六，旅行書報　旅行雜誌，刊行迄今，已爲第十三載，以闡揚中國名勝，提倡旅行，發展交通事業爲主旨，每月發行一次，又編印行旅便覽，詳載全國之火車輪船飛機汽車等之票價時刻，行李費用，以供旅客參考。此外並隨時印刊各地導游專書，各地交通概况圖說，凡足指導旅客出行利便者，均不惜財力物力以完成之。</p>
<p>七，引導游覽　無論團體或個人至國內各地，（或竟往歐美各國）如不明各種情形者，本社均可代爲計劃及引導游覽，關於舟車費用食宿等，俱有詳盡之答案供給，並隨時在各地舉辦各種游覽旅行，歡迎各界加入，故本社可以名之曰山川名勝之兜售者。</p>
<p>八，旅行支票　舟車之中，携帶旅費，極感不便，本社代客向上海銀行購用旅行支票，凡通都大邑，無不通用，卽極安全，又甚簡使。</p>
<p>結論　綜觀上海之放行事業，若以現狀論，固未可期其發展，然而未來之光明，則方興未艾，將來之事業，大有可圖，今日之由盛而衰，亦正爲將來由衰而盛之預兆；且旅行事業，非有恃於市面之繫興，更不隨國事之治亂，以定營業之增减，在其他各業繁盛之際，旅行事業固能極力發達，永無止境；但往往在各業凋敝，市面日簡之時，旅行事業反能有崎形之進展。要之，須在主其事者，能運用其腦力，爲旅客竭誠服務，爲公衆謀福利耳。</p>

<h3>（四）內在的珍寶</h3>
<p>某君碌碌終身，天天想發財致富·等他死後，房屋典賣典人，卻被別人發見此屋牆內，藏有大宗珍寶·可惜該君，一生奔波，卻沒有發見無穹財富，是藏於他自己的屋中！今天許多人，撲撲風塵，無非爲求身外之物，卻不知自己內在的珍寶！讀者，你有否發覺在你裹頭蘊藏的，是神所賦，有神性情，有神聖的的靈魂嗎？我們不要目光如豆，則身於利祿之場，受物欲的蒙蔽，致內在的珍寶，永遠活埋於罪惡過犯之中！人的組織，有靈有魂有體，體是魂與靈的工具，魂是與自己交通的機官，有知覺知道怎樣保守自身之利益，靈是與神交通的機官，能辦別是非，知道榮神益人，今天若人能讓　來支配魂與題，便可恢復了原人的地位。所以我願親愛的讀者會發覺自己裹頭寶貴的靈性，仰賴神愛我們的大愛，當我們死在罪惡過犯中的時候，惟有信神叫我們與基督耶穌一同活過來，因爲我們得救是本乎恩，也着信。——上海基督教文字怖道会郵箱一二二七號。</p>

<h3>招商局近狀</h3>
<p>招商輪船局現已賃定怡盛洋行舊基之房屋，方在修理，的半月竣工，即可遷居矣。查此局近殊盛旺，大異初創之時。上海銀主，多欲附入股份者。惟該局本銀已足，計共銀百萬之數，分爲一百股也。前日發船至長崎神戶，蓋擬在上海東洋常川往來。其船名伊敦，惟費煤較多，幸長崎煤價甚廉，沿途隨辦，亦頗便也。</p>
<h3>陰岡夜市</h3>
<p>吳淞西南十里有陰岡地方，烟戶數十家，不爲冷落；而其交易，皆以昏夜，日間家家閉戶，即茶樓酒市，亦寂其無人，門則半開牟掩。至上燈時，則百事具舉，舉凡柴米油鹽以及百工技藝，均開張交易。挑瓜賣菜之担，皆各縣有一燈，爲稱物數錢而設。鄉人貿絲抱布者，亦絡繹而來，貨畢市酒肉而歸，則夜過半矣。經官憲屢禁，不能變易。昨夜所賣之錢，忽發見多屬紙灰，以後擬各設一水盆，投錢其中，以騐其眞偽。惟終不能變日中爲市之常則也。</p>
<h3>邑尊祈雨身殉</h3>
<p>鎭江府屬之某邑亢旱，屢禱無靈邑尊遂舁城隍神像至烈日中，責以守土之義，彼亦衣冠與之同曝，自朝至暮，不食勺米。乃城隍神土偶，則固依然無恙；而邑尊肉身，則巳不及食新，蓋曝至七日，遂中暑而亡。此公眞可謂以死勤事者矣。</p>

<h3>第一國際收容所附設　無綫電訓練班</h3>
<p>— 紊霞</p>
<p>訓練期六個月出路無問題</p>
<p>最近會公開表演成績不壞</p>
<p>哈同花園將開放</p>
<p>上海難民的給養，始終成爲一個問題，許多主持難民收容所的人士，都在焦慮着難民以後的經費，最近聽說有人在向哈同花園主人接洽，希望能開放一决，開放以後的門票，最少可得十幾萬元，暑期中兩個月的難民經費，倒從此可以</p>
<p>據說哈同太太還沒有答應，爲了數十萬難民的食養，好做善事的哈同太太，似乎也不應該再堅持下去，如使這一計劃能實現的話，這倒是眞眞的大好事。</p>
<p>一二十年前，哈同花園曾開放過一决，（據說內部風景極佳）現在如若再開放，確是一樁稀有的盛舉呢！</p>
<p>以上這個消息，只能算是附帶的報告。</p>
<p>昨天，爲了去訪問馬斯南路上第一國際收容所裏附設的難童無綫電訓練班，同時也得到一個不幸的消息，就是這收容所奉了總會的命令，現在已在疏散難民，使一般有家鄕有職業的人，慢慢離開收容所，想在最近期內把這收容所結束</p>
<p>雖然我們不能說難民必需永遠依靠難民收容所，但救濟會經費的支絀，却於此可見的　　第一國際收容所的地址，本來是震旦大學的換塲，震旦也曾催過好幾次，要收回自用，看上去，這第一收容所不久就得結束的。</p>
<p>昨天我去的時候，就看見收容所蘆蓆棚門前，堆滿了包裏與零星物件，大概這就是離所難胞們的物件吧。</p>
<p>我和所中主任潘先生及敎育組主任李馥承先生作了半小時的談話，承他們領我參觀無綫電班的課室，時間已經中午了，十六七歲的男女難童，正在他們教室的桌子上吃他們最清苦的午餐。</p>
<p>十一日那天，他們這班無綫電班，曾經請上海幾家無綫電公司的經理，如李維壽，楊樹芬諸先生担任評判，舉行了一决無綫電通報的表演。</p>
<p>表演的方法是用一張英文稿子，由敎授用無錢電碼發出來，當塲由男女學生收下來；第二步是由學生自己發自己收</p>
<p>據說那天表演的成績不壞</p>
<p>李馥承先生說：這訓練班的學生，本來是由國際收容所的三個收容所裹自己保送的，除外旁的收容所也保送很多人</p>
<p>開始辦的時候，大的有五六十人，後來把視覺聽覺不靈敏的剔去，現在全班人數有三十四人。女生有六七人。</p>
<p>訓練的步驟共分兩種：第一，是初級訓練班，注重收報發報；第二是高級訓練班，注重收發報機的修理及裝置，訊練時間是六個月。</p>
<p>照現在時間課程的支配，六個月當然是相當短促的，如若學生能下點苦功，當然也可以應付了。</p>
<p>據潘主任說：六個月訓練完畢，出路可以完全無問題，因爲各處正大量需要這項人材</p>
<p>担任敎練的是張和卿汪壽齡二先生，他們都是完全盡義務，並不支取薪給，這種精神，很可佩服。</p>
<p>所中的生產方面，又在計劃製造紅藍墨水，經過好多决的試騐，這計劃已得總所的同意，大的不久就可以製造出品</p>
<p>據說這第一收容所中的難　　每一　人都是生產工作者，有些是外面有職業的，有些是所中做工的，一個收容所能做到如此地步，的確已很不容易了。</p>
<p>附帶又參觀了所中爲難胞們所設的托兒所，我參觀的時候，大的有十數個六七歲的兒童，坐在一張矮的長方桌上吃飯，個個都是又肥又胖，中間有一個站起來對我一鞠躬，我對他笑笑點點頭，他馬上轉過去對他的小伙伴說：</p>
<p>「他對我點點頭呢！」</p>
<p>我和潘先生季先生聽了都笑了起來。</p>
<p>孩子們的天眞，這些地方是够可愛的。</p>
<h3>「蕩寇志」觀感</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Jesse　James”</p>
<p>廿世紀福期出品　大光明戲院映　　　　喧傳一　世的「蕩寇志」，終究不加座價在大光明開映了。以演員陣容來看：有泰羅鮑華，甫姗凱蘭，亨利方達等；導演又是金亨利；而且是彩色片。可是以「蕩寇志」來比擬「羅賓漢」，似乎不大適當，第一，「羅賓漢」是以羣衆的力量來制勝敵人的：而「蕩寇志」祇憑了佛蘭克和傑西倆的匹夫之勇。馳騁於美國西部，以致傑西終於遭了黨徒福特的暗算；第二，埃洛雨茀林的羅賓漢和泰羅鮑華的傑西，也有不同之處，這不同之處，大概是決定於體格的。泰羅鮑華的傑西在有幾塲戲中，果然一洗過去風流小生的風姿，但和埃洛爾茀林比起來，總不及他的英武，矯捷。</p>
<p>或許正因爲如此，導演者金亨利氏也並不致力在傑西的行動上，這里紙是佔到最少數的三塲戲：刦火車；刦獄；刦銀行。不過他的細小的精緻的堆積，都處理得非常生動，活潑，如佛蘭克傑西和巴西搏鬥；佛蘭克刦獄前的佈置；及齊爾黛之叔羅福士這人物的勾劃等等，使許多沉悶的塲面都跳動起來。</p>
<p>而相反的，金亨利氏幾乎致全力於傑西和齊爾黛的戀愛上。在麥考克佯言不究傑西旣往，僅作五年之監禁以後，齊爾黛婉勸傑西棄邪歸正；齊爾黛和傑西到敎堂結婚；刦獄後，他們匿居在山中；齊爾黛生產後，爲愛干前途計，毅然俠叔同居；而最後傑西因福特的賣友求榮，刦在銀行時受了傷回來，及將赴加利福尼亞時候的兩塲戲，特別着力，把這一對息難夫妻的生離死別，盡纏綿悱惻之能事。</p>
<p>南姗凱蘭的齊爾黛，在上述幾塲戲中都演得非常深刻，動人。</p>
<p>不過我喜歡的倒是前半部戲，他把巴西之流這輩土豪劣紳，藉了政府的護符，强收買農民土地，橫行不法，及麥考克的「自食其言」，都使人猛省：我們要安居樂業，先要剷除這批流氓不可，同時，一切的甘言蜜語都是含砒的毒藥，在「此時此地」的我們，應自警惕的。即是畫面的織接前半部戲也很緊湊有力。</p>
<p>亨利方達的戲太少。</p>
<p>至於色彩，有一塲戲運用得特別可愛，就是傑西躍馬上火車，火車在疾馳，傑西在車頂上爬行，上面是蔚藍的天空，下面窓洞中映着電燈光下的人面，而車廂是赭赤的一片，在三種不同層决的色彩中，不但是悅目，且顯示了彩色片的特殊効能。</p>
<h3>畫怎樣稱爲氣韵生動</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>國畫是藝術之一，亦是國粹之一，愛好藝術，固爲人類之天性，故硏究藝術，原是一種極有趣味的事，但無論國畫西畫，均以氣韵爲最耍條件，我不懂西畫，且來談談國畫。</p>
<p>昔謝赫云，畫有六法：一曰氣韻，二曰骨法，三曰應物象形，四曰隨類賦彩，五曰經營位置，六曰傳模移寫。六法之中，以氣韵生動爲第一法，其實氣韵二字，何足爲法哉，蓋所謂法者，必有規矩法度可循，必有準繩跡象可守，若氣韵則爲空洞虛靈之物，可以意會而不可以言傳，而古人以氣韵二字，刻諸六法之首，其意何居？</p>
<p>盡原以氣韵爲主，自古然矣。畫無氣韵，猶人無靈魂，人無靈魂，則行屍走肉，不得爲人；畫無氣韵，則刻劃堆砌，安得爲之畫乎。古人謂書與畫同出一源，則凡善書者似必能善盡。而善畫者亦必能善書，但字固人人所能書，而以善書稱者，古今能有幾人，古今之能畫者，不知凡幾，而其畫之足以流傳不朽者叉幾伺人也</p>
<p>古人謂畫家之病，皆繫用筆，所謂三者：一曰板，二曰刻，三曰結，若患些三病，其畫雖工，不足觀矣。文徵明云：點墨落紙，大非細事，必須胸中　然無一物，然後烟雲秀色，與天地生生之氣，自然溱泊。董其昌云：氣韵不可學，自然天授，然亦有學得處，讀萬卷書，行萬里路，胸中脫盡慶濁，自然丘壑內營，隨手寫出，皆爲山水傳神，鄧椿畫橋云：表之爲用大矣，盈天地間者萬物，悉皆含毫運思，曲盡其妙，而所以能曲盡者，止一法耳，一者爲何，曰傳神而已，此徒知人之有神，而不知物之有神，此郭若虛所以深鄙衆工，謂雖云畫而非畫者，蓋止能傳其形，而不能傳其神也。夫古人所謂神，所謂氣韵，一言蔽之，畫當作有生機之畫，而不應作無生機之畫，應作活潑潑地之畫而不應作死板板之畫也。</p>
<p>然則畫當以氣韵生動爲第一義，斷可知矣。顧如何而爲氣韵，如何而爲生動。古人雖有是語，但古人從未加以說明，亦無法加以說明也。蓋所謂氣韵生動也者，僅可心領神會，而莫能言宣，古人尚不可以言傳，則我又安得而傳之耶。無己，請舉古畫家傳神之說以實之，則凡硏究畫事者，或有所領悟焉。（未完）</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>潘佩英檢出這兩封信以後，也無非對它哭了一場，以爲人已死了，還有何說，不過把這兩封遺書寶藏起來。又痴痴的想到當初不寫那封冷淡拒絕的回信，或者不至於就死，那是我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死」了。潘佩英那時父親也死了，家中人也零落離散了，自已自由倒可以自由了，只是孤孤凄凄，好似離羣之雁。有許多人以爲她是潘老老的女兒，不願與、她親近。她也好像自慚形穢，人家不理她，她也不去睬人家。她這時在一個小學校裹敎敎書，以渾過這幾年光陰。一直到中國全部光復以後，有兩年了。有一天，她回到無錫去，偶然一個人到惠山去走走。這時正當三月裹，是一個春光明媚的好天氣，職後的惠山，比前繁盛得多。這天又是一個星期日，游人頗多。她不免又想起從前自己在學校的時候，遇着星期日，常常有許多同學，結伴游山。有時也同趙樂天兩人到此小坐，光陰靈瞥，一瞬即逝，而且現在更是人天永別了。她坐在一個地方，瞧着許多士女，熙熙攘攘的往來笑語，自己却只是痴痴地出神。却不堤防有一個人，走到她前面，輕輕的喚着她道：『佩英姊，好久不見了，你還認識我嗎？』佩英舉目看時，原是一位舊日的女同學袁淑文，當日一同在某學校讀書，一起在學生會辦事的。此刻雖然面色蒼老了許多，但面型依然仍在。潘佩英連忙站起來道：「是淑文姊，怎麽會不認識？噯呀！我們這一別，有七八年了嗎？』袁淑文道：『眞是多年不見了。近來趙先生身體康健嗎？我們也是好久不見了。』潘佩英聽了，摸不着頭腦，呆了一呆，便問道：那一個趙先生？』袁淑文道：『我問的是趙樂天先生，當時我們也是一同在學生會辦事的，不想他後來投筆從軍，眞的如此勇敢呢？我本想來望望你們兩位的，一向蹉跎未果，今天却巧得很，在這裹就碰到了老友了。』潘佩英聽她如此說，更是莫名其妙了。因想趙樂天已經死了，什麽　問我：身體健康吾？又說：望望你們兩位，把我牽在一處，那個袁淑文，不是活活的見着鬼嗎？（一三八）</p>

<h3>言菊朋不日抵滬</h3>
<p>— 慕雲</p>
<p>黃金戲院於毛世來之後，已的定由言菊朋，侯玉蘭，馬連崑，王福山等承乏。（二十五日到滬二十八起登台）侯係北平戲曲學校之高材生，日前本刊曾刊其「祭江」劇照，侯飾孫尚香，態度雍容大方扮相嗓音均有足取。數年來坤旦之蒞滬出演者，祇一章遏震尚博得台下歡迎，惟彼究非鬥裏出身，倘無胡鐵芬之琴音爲輔，恐亦難見精彩。玉蘭卒業於北平戲校，實際即等於出科弟子，技藝當然不弱，而况自來女伶之坐科習藝者，殊不多覯。玉蘭與趙金蓉同爲戲校坤旦中之傑出人材，趙生聞已適人，侯生此番隨菊朋南來，不特關係其個人之前途甚鉅，同時亦可藉此時機將其母校之成績貢獻於海上仕女之前也。馬連崑與王福山之技藝如何，海上顧曲界已知之綦詳，無待贅述，黃金當局並擬將高盛鱗江世玉裘盛戎諸人留下，以備與菊朋配戲。盛麟此番風頭甚健，由三牌躍爲二牌，面子可謂足極，盛戎乃名凈裘桂仙哲嗣，雖身量略小，然作戲認眞，家學淵源，倘與菊朋玉蘭合演「全本大保國」必能勝任愉快，博得好評。菊朋久未在滬露演，邇來嗓音又已大好，所帶配角亦甚整齊，預料此决成績必甚美滿也。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>言菊朋之戲裝</h3>
<h3>海上兩劇團將出國</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>自從中國牡丹劇團出國到小呂宋去演唱，得到很美滿的成績回來以後，現在上海又有人在那裏發動，要組織劇團到海外去，照我知道，在進行中有兩個劇團，一個是金連喜組織的，他準備步牡丹團的後塵到小呂宋去，那裹已由嫁人的坤角武生花中俠，設法領取劇團的進口證，如果能够成爲事實，在下個月就要啟程。還有一個是坤旦碧玉貞，和新嘉坡代表陳君談妥條件，由她組班前去，她也在積極進行邀角了。</p>
<h3>余叔岩最敬重的人</h3>
<p>— 天賜</p>
<p>說起叔岩他的性質很古怪，只知任着性子兒幹，即使是名人去請他唱戲，他「不買面子」起來，往往加以拒絕。不過，他對於已故前光復軍統領李徵五老先生，則唯命是聽，不敢發大爺脾氣」。實在他的「出人頭地」，紅得發紫，還是李老一手提拔的呢！</p>
<p>原來他以前沒有紅的時候，境況亦不過爾爾。後來他的藝術，給李老發見，把他推薦給自己門生，獨覇一方的「長腿將軍」張宗昌。張乃看在老夫子面上，另眼照顧他，張府每有堂會，即招他去，他總得拿個一萬八千賞金，生活得以過得很舒適，所以他「飲水思源」，不得不對李老特別敬重。</p>
<p>憶長城唱片公司成立的時候，曾由公司當局派人去邀請他灌片，結果竟遭他「拒之千里」。畏城公司乃求於李老，李老即打一長途電話到北平，他立卽回電「遵命」，並不談其他，這是他報答李老的美意。而該公司的有他唱片，亦得感謝李老。——所以李徵五可說是余叔岩最敬重的人了。</p>
<h3>樂園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>瑤卿麗卿的晚境皆遠遜於鳳卿</p>
<p>王彩林的長子名瑤卿，次日鳳卿，麗卿最幼，瑤卿因曾於譚鑫培劉鴻聲許薩棠等著名鬚生合演於同慶，中華舞臺，及福壽班爲時甚久，故出名甚早。彼時鳳卿麗卿都沒有名氣，鳳二方在唱小生，（瑤鄉與劉跛合營中華舞臺時。鳳卿已改老生），麗卿亦習且行。初時家庭開支多由瑤卿担任，他本來是個忠厚人，對於這些扶持嗣弟的事情，縱令每月多掏出幾個錢，也並不放在心上。不過婦人家究竟氣量小，况且王大奶奶又是個好管閑事，好多說話的人，故而妯娌間就發生了惡感。鳳卿夫妻迫於環境，雖是時常聽到閑話，也祗好忍氣呑聲，不敢稍露不愉之色。後來瑤卿忽然嗓音失潤，弄到塌中（中年後失音，詞之塌中，伶人最怕此關，因年輕倒嗓音尚易復阮，若一塌中，即永無回復之望，現在高慶奎就是這個毛病。）的地步。同時鳳卿改演在派鬚生後，反而大紅起來，兩人相較，正與以前相反。及至蘭芳聲譽日隆，鳳卿當然也隨之身價增高，蘭芳每到滬漢各埠出演一次，包銀就有三五萬元，鳳卿也就每决可以拿到八九千元的鉅款。况且他長子少卿自從爲蘭芳操二胡後，每月也能賺進兩三千元，有時梅，王，接受堂會及港片諸事，鳳卿父子全能得到額外的收入，因此許多年來，鳳二的私產幾乎要有十萬有零了。他這人生性寡言，懶與外界交往，無戲時一天到晚關在家裹。同老妻對燈對抽。（三九）</p>

<p>舞國寫影（廿七）</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>舞廳的廣告問題</h3>
<p>關於這問題，我覺得有幾點應該要注意討論的，現在且寫在下面，以備當局的採擇：</p>
<p>一舞廳究竟需要不需要登廣告：要研究這一點，我們先要硏究爲什麽要登廣告，答案一定是要招來顧客，那末是不是登了廣告就一定有顧客光降呢？反過來說，是不是不登廣告一定沒有顧客光降呢？這個問題就很難解答了，或說反正登廣告總比不登廣告可以多來幾個客，這答案似乎嫌着太含糊，究竟根據什麽原理，有什麽憑據呢？照我說，舞廳並不是天天需要刊登廣告，但遇到裝璜舞星樂隊等變更的時候，則必需要刋登廣告的，登廣告的意義，是要呌人知道我的優點，至於知道了來不來，那要看我的優點合不合他的脾胃，不過有一句話可以肯定地說，客家知道了我的優點，來不來雖然不能預定，但不知道總決定不會來，所以我們可以決定登廣告是確實需要。</p>
<p>二廣告的措詞要符合實際：一點不但關係著信用問題，於實際營業上，確乎關係重大，人家上當祗上一回，你這决騙了他，下决冉對他挖出心來，他也耍起三分疑心，我記得有一决想去看影戲，翻到牠的廣告，却寫着火速早來定座，後至難免向隅等一類的詞句，（原文記不淸了，大概是這個意思罷。）其時已離開映時祗有五分鐘了，我說去也找不到座位，不如不去爲妙，我的朋友說，恐怕廣告是吹吹牛的，就强拉着我去，其時影戲已經開映了，及至進內一看，可說是第一排至末一排，你愛坐那兒就坐那兒，從此以後我們凡是看見這家戲院的廣告，無論說得怎樣天花亂墜，總是不相信了。</p>
<p>三選採刊登廣告的報紙：諺云，蘿根靑菜，各人所愛，一種報紙，有一種報紙的牘者，當舞廳當局要想刊登某項廣告的時候，最好先想一想，我這廣告的內容，是最合那一階段人脾胃的，再想一想，那一階段的人，大概是閱讀何種報紙的，那末這廣告就容易收到實效了，據我所曉得，上海報紙的銷數，當然要推申新二報爲數廣，大概大些的工商機關，總是兩種兼備，小型商店，比較看新聞報的多，若高尚家庭，有購買力的市民，似乎看申報的　多，，我親友的家庭中到有十分這七八是看申報的，所以仙樂和百樂門，常有她們的踪跡了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in Tianjin Intensifies Blockade of Concessions, Incitement Activities Become More Intense, Food Shortages in Concessions, British Consul Lodges Verbal Protest, Japanese Side Refuses to Respond, Japanese Veterans' Cemetery Visit Plan Automatically Cancelled</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) External News: The Japanese army in Tianjin has been blockading the British and French concessions for the third day today. No incidents have occurred. Japanese sentries continue to check people entering and leaving the two concessions. For foreign nationals, they only check their passports and the contents of their bags. However, British nationals must undergo the same treatment as Chinese, being checked in order, with some forced to undress and others forced to return after the search. It takes Chinese people seven or eight hours or more to enter the concessions, with some waiting for twenty-four hours. Many Chinese workers have been prevented by the Japanese from entering the concessions and ordered to work in the area under the jurisdiction of the puppet temporary government. Food is still relatively abundant in the French concession, but more difficult in the British concession. Two Chinese vendors attempted to deliver several baskets of vegetables into the British concession, but were shot and killed by Japanese soldiers (Dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The main events that occurred here today are as follows: (1) Two Chinese people were reportedly arrested and shot for passing baskets over obstacles into the British concession. (2) The activities of agitators have become more intense. (3) Food shortages continue. This morning, several gunshots suddenly occurred near the obstacles at the entrance of Racecourse Road, awakening residents in the southern section of Special District One from their dreams. It was then learned that two Chinese people had been shot for passing baskets over obstacles into the concession, causing widespread panic. The Japanese side claimed that this action was to teach others a lesson. It is reported that yesterday, more than two thousand rioters who failed to break into the British concession were now gathering at several laundry shops in Special District One that serve foreigners, severely scolding the owners and staff for washing foreigners' dirty clothes and advising the laundry workers not to work for foreigners, destroying the baskets used for holding clothes and throwing the clothes around before leaving with a swagger. Today, residents in the British concession are slightly fearful upon hearing that the Japanese are repeatedly trying to enter the concession under the pretext of visiting the graves of Japanese who died in the Boxer Rebellion. The British authorities are currently considering this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The plan of Japanese veterans and other Japanese to enter the British concession in Tianjin in a procession to visit the graves of Japanese who died in the Boxer Rebellion has been automatically cancelled upon the advice of the Japanese authorities there (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, the Japanese authorities intensified the blockade of the concessions, making it even more difficult for Chinese people to enter and leave, so very few were granted passage. British nationals, mindful of the insults they suffered in the past two days, do not lightly leave the concessions unless absolutely necessary. A Chinese foreman told a Reuters reporter that this morning he saw a large number of coolies on the French concession side of the Wan Guo Bridge, wanting to enter the British concession, being forced into cargo trucks in groups of thirty and driven elsewhere. He asked a foreigner crossing the bridge what was happening. The foreigner replied that the Japanese were recruiting these coolies to work elsewhere. The food situation has not improved much. Although there were more vegetables in the vegetable market this morning, the prices were high and the quality was poor. Milk was also transported into the concession by truck, but it was still insufficient. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese consulate has refused to acknowledge the British consul's protest against the Japanese soldiers' overly strict search of British nationals and the difficulty in transporting food into the concessions. The British consul's protest was a verbal protest over the phone, but the Japanese side replied, "Japan has its own discretion in maintaining peace and order in Tianjin, and others are not allowed to interfere." However, although today's searches are the same as yesterday's, the stripping of clothes has stopped. Many people here believe that if the United States were to protest, the blockade of the Tianjin concessions would be lifted sooner. Fox Company's photographer, Meier, was released tonight, which relieved the British consul. When American McCain passed the Japanese sentry line on Wilson Street today, he repeatedly stated that he was an American, but he was still searched. McCain then reported to the American consulate, and after the American consulate negotiated with the Japanese side, the Japanese side immediately apologized, considering it a misunderstanding. After that, McCain was no longer searched when entering and leaving the area. Due to the unstable situation in Tianjin, British merchant ships have now changed their berthing to Qinhuangdao. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th) According to Japanese newspapers' report of the Tianjin situation, the Japanese side must have the following conditions before the British concession can be unblocked: (1) The British and Japanese will jointly search for the perpetrators of previous and subsequent terrorist acts. (2) Thoroughly crack down on anti-Japanese elements in the British concession. (3) All attempts to disrupt the economic measures of the "temporary government" in North China must be eliminated. (4) The silver currently held by Chinese banks in the British concession, worth 50 million yuan, must be handed over to the "temporary government." The Japanese authorities in Tianjin are determined to continue isolating the British concession until the British side accepts and implements these conditions. The Japanese authorities are also preparing to adopt more effective plans to counter new provocative actions by the British side. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Hebei Provincial Bank recently decided to move out of the French concession on the 18th. The French concession authorities specifically notified the Banking Association, saying that the bank has not been approved by the concession authorities and must not move out on its own. Moreover, the bank has been operating in the French concession for a long time. If it moves out suddenly, it may affect the financial situation within the concession and is not easy to move out. (Dispatch on the 16th) Today, the Japanese army continued to blockade the British and French concessions. Although the situation is tense, it is peaceful and uneventful. Most of the British nationals who went outside the British concession yesterday moved into the concession, reducing the chance of accidents occurring at the obstacles set up by the Japanese army. This morning, the vegetable market was empty. Chilled meat can still be purchased, but vegetables are almost impossible to buy. This morning, the British embassy expressed surprise that the Japanese had not yet released Canadian photographer Meyer, who was arrested two days ago. Although the Japanese promised to release him late yesterday, he was still detained as of 9:30 this morning. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Canadian news photographer Mr. Meyer, who was arrested on Wednesday for taking pictures in what the Japanese called a restricted area, was released today. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Japanese claims, the British ship Yang Tai Sheng (transliteration) rushed into the blockade area of ​​Gulangyu yesterday, transporting many Chinese passengers and goods. The Japanese authorities have issued a warning, prohibiting any further attempts of this kind from occurring. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>London Official Issues Semi-Official Statement, Japanese Claims Involve Treaty Rights of Various Countries in China, If Formal Demands Are Made, a Serious Situation Will Be Created, At That Time, Britain Will Have No Choice But to Consider Taking Positive Action</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible persons here say that the Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, is extremely serious in nature, and they have issued a semi-official statement explaining Britain's position, stating that the case originated from the Japanese side pointing out that four Chinese people were involved in the Cheng Xigeng case and demanding their extradition, but consistently refusing to present evidence. (The British concession authorities subsequently agreed to refer this issue to an independent advisory committee, but the Japanese side did not agree and decided to implement a blockade of the British and French concessions. A Japanese spokesman then issued a statement involving serious issues in the Far East. It was found that a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on the 24th of last month, the intention of which threatened the treaty rights held by various countries in China. The British and French governments have made representations on this matter, and the case is still unresolved. However, this decision by the Japanese spokesman in Tianjin has intensified, which shows that the extradition of the four Chinese people is no longer the reason for the blockade of the British concession. What the Japanese side is demanding is "Britain should cooperate with Japan to build a new order in East Asia." In other words, Britain should abandon its policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, and not allow any protection for anti-Japanese elements and communists, stop assisting the Chinese legal tender, and stop hoarding various goods from the north." (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Map of the British and French Concessions in Tianjin</p>
<p>No longer condoning illegal elements in the concessions using money to transmit news, prohibiting schools in the concessions from using anti-Japanese textbooks, all of these broad demands are sufficient to involve the treaty rights held by various countries in China, and the British side will certainly consider them to be serious in nature. The meaning is almost that Britain should abandon its original policy under the threat of violence. The British government had originally proposed to the Japanese government that the Tianjin dispute be made a local incident. Although the Japanese authorities have rejected this proposal, Britain still hopes that it will change its attitude. On the contrary, if the Japanese authorities in North China unfortunately persist in their views and formally make new demands, a serious situation will inevitably be created. At that time, the British government will have to consider taking immediate positive action to protect its interests in China.</p>
<h3>US Will Jointly Protest with Britain and France</h3>
<p>(Washington) American businessmen there are similarly affected by the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, so the United States is expected to join with Britain and France to lodge a strong protest with Japan. This decision was made after a special meeting between Secretary of State Hull and his principal advisors. However, regarding the adoption of economic retaliatory measures against Japan, such as refusing Japanese ships and commercial projects, a cautious attitude will be taken, fearing that strict economic sanctions would be enough to cause war. According to officials, no matter what action Secretary of State Hull takes, it will not put the United States on the front line. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Action is a Show of Support for the Axis Powers</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to French officials and diplomatic circles, the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is a show of support for the Rome-Berlin Axis, as it would prevent Britain and France from focusing on Europe and shift their attention to Asia, so dictators can have a respite. However, Britain, France, and the United States are still consulting incessantly, but nothing is known except that the governments of the three countries are paying close attention to the situation in the Far East. At the same time, the content of the consultations is also unknown. Regarding Britain and France's decision to adopt strong retaliatory measures against Japan, it is still not considered credible here, because the British and French governments' discussions have concluded that economic retaliatory measures may not be effective, because Japan's current position is quite capable of waging economic warfare against Britain and France, and at the same time, it can extend this blockade to other concessions, such as Shanghai. According to those familiar with current affairs, the most worrying thing at the moment is that the Japanese will force the British to take a hard line. It is reported that the French government has decided to stand on the British side regarding the Tianjin incident. Although Japan has specifically chosen Britain as its target for provocation, France will not change its consistent attitude with Britain. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Traffic Safety Awareness Week</h3>
<p>In the past year, there have been as many as 15,183 traffic accident cases in the two Shanghai concessions, with 5,166 deaths and injuries. The concession authorities are worried about human lives and are cautiously seeking ways to prevent accidents. Therefore, they have decided to hold a Traffic Safety Awareness Week starting tomorrow, which is a very good intention. The reason why the number of accident cases has reached an unprecedented record is attributed to pedestrian congestion, which is not without reason. Not only is it congested, but also because refugees from the mainland flock to Shanghai, they are unfamiliar with traffic regulations and do not know how to avoid traffic. When they suddenly see vehicles speeding by, they are often panicked, at a loss, and unable to move forward or backward, resulting in unexpected events. Furthermore, some drivers disregard pedestrian congestion, take it lightly, and assume that people will give way to them, but they do not know that cars can injure people. As for those who neglect their duties and treat human lives like grass; those who are careless and make people know that the road is like a tiger's mouth, which should not be taken lightly, while also strictly adhering to traffic regulations and not treating human lives as a game, making the movement a reality, which is truly a blessing for the citizens.</p>
<p>However, traffic safety awareness is a superficial measure. The reason why there are so many accident cases is that if population congestion is the main reason, it is largely contrary to the principles of urban development. The prosperity of a city lies in the development of industry and commerce, which inevitably attracts refugees from all over the country to Shanghai. Therefore, cities are not worried about population congestion or pedestrian disturbance, but about how to maintain order and ensure the safety of traffic, which should be planned from all aspects of municipal administration.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the Shanghai concessions is generally closely related to China's internal turmoil and external troubles. From the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Small Swords Society to the Boxer Rebellion, the Xinhai Revolution, the Qi-Lu War, and the arrival of the National Revolutionary Army in Shanghai, Shanghai will prosper every time there is an incident. Only the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents caused Shanghai to appear desolate during the war. After the August 13th war shifted inland, Shanghai returned to its status as a "safe haven" for refugees. When the two concessions were initially planned for road administration, they were much wider than the roads in mainland China. They did not consider the factors that would contribute to the prosperity of the concessions in the next hundred years or so, or the progress of material civilization as it is today. Later, they also tried to adapt to the needs of the environment, gradually improving over time and location, but ultimately limited by the old equipment, unable to make large-scale improvements. As a result, the population increased slightly, and the original roads were insufficient to cope with the new situation of congested vehicles and pedestrians. This is why the number of accident cases increases with the increase in population.</p>
<p>Before the war in Shanghai, the factory areas were all in the north and south of the concessions, and due to the terrain, there were many roads directly connecting the north and south of the concessions, and fewer roads connecting the east and west. The only main roads in the public concession that can be called east-west connecting roads are Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, Beijing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, and Fuxu Road, which is currently being widened, as well as Weihaiwei Road and Racecourse Road turning into Fuzhou Road. In the French concession, there is only Avenue Joffre and Xujiahui Road. In addition, Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch are now jointly managed by the two concessions. The position of Avenue Dubail, which connects Avenue de Kesseler and Avenue Foch, is similar to that of the future Weihaiwei Road. And when it enters the Xihui area, only Yuyuan Road, Daxi Road, and Connaught Road are left. After the Shanghai War, all factories sought development in Xihui, so the traffic from east to west became more prosperous. Since Nanjing Road is not allowed to carry goods back and forth, Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, Beijing Road, and Avenue Edward VII became the main arteries for vehicles to travel east and west. Most vehicles are concentrated on a few roads, how can they not be crowded and congested, making it difficult to move and cross, and accidents are prone to occur.</p>
<p>The biggest harm to traffic congestion is vehicles loading goods. Small ones are like handcarts, and large ones are trucks and flatbed carts. Although handcarts and small carts are small in size, the goods they carry often extend beyond the body of the cart. They are pushed and pulled by one or two people, and the speed is not high, which is more likely to cause congestion. They also travel alongside rickshaws on the side of the road. When cars and trams pass by, the three vehicles meet, which is most likely to cause danger. This is the first reason. Flatbed carts are heavy and clumsy, and it is already difficult to pull them. They are often located in the middle of the road, obstructing the movement of other vehicles. In addition, the wooden and iron wheels cause deeper friction on the road surface, and the movement is very slow. Recently, the Public Works Bureau has charged particularly high donations for such flatbed carts, and lower donations for flatbed carts that have been converted into steam-powered carts, which also implies the intention of prohibiting them. This is the second reason. Since the prevalence of trucks, in order to load more goods and save costs, the body of the car has become larger and larger. Where the road surface is narrower, one car cannot accommodate other cars. With the current uneven width of the road, it is already narrow and unbearable to drive cars, trams, and rickshaws. In addition to the huge trucks, speeding and reckless driving, how can traffic not be congested and how can accidents be eradicated. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order for traffic safety awareness to be effective, it should start with the rectification of road administration and vehicles. Otherwise, no matter how careful pedestrians are, the arrival of accidents is truly beyond what can be predicted. For example, walking on the sidewalk should be the safest, but there are also cases where cars drive onto the sidewalk due to poor driving, drunkenness, insomnia, or narrow roads, causing accidents. How can this be said to be "the deceased was not careful." Another example is directing traffic without waiting for vehicles to pass completely, and then releasing vehicles from other roads, making it impossible to stop and dangerous to proceed. How can this be said to be the fault of "not obeying traffic directions." Other examples include bicycles often swooping past pedestrians and vehicles from behind like eagles, suddenly catching them off guard; cars overtaking trams, and when tram passengers are getting on and off, they fly by the trams with a whirring sound, making it impossible for passengers to get on or off. The northeast corner of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road is narrow and has a lot of traffic, and pedestrians often stand by the side of the road, trying to cross, and a little carelessness can lead to disaster. This is the fault of the pedestrians. There are many similar examples. As for the psychological mistakes of pedestrians and drivers, such as one thinking that cars must give way to people, and the other thinking that people must give way to cars, if both sides have such intentions, do not know how to yield to each other, there will eventually be an accident.</p>
<p>There is still something that cannot be left unsaid, which is to protect the safety of pedestrians while striving to take into account the convenience of traffic for the majority of citizens. If it is necessary to restrict the driving of certain vehicles due to narrow roads or road repairs, it should start with the driving or timing of trucks, and should not restrict rickshaws, which are used by the public to travel far away. Even if it is necessary to restrict rickshaws in addition to trucks, to the greatest extent, they should be allowed one-way traffic, and should not be completely restricted, so as to give citizens the impression that only those who sit in cars can go anywhere. It is also hoped that those who direct traffic can always adopt a well-intentioned guiding attitude, be cautious in handling matters, and not abuse their powers, so that citizens will feel satisfied while maintaining traffic.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this Traffic Safety Awareness Week, alarmed by the large number of traffic accidents last year, we sincerely hope that the traffic safety awareness will achieve great results. However, what is stated in this article only shows the complexity of cause and effect, which requires improvement in many aspects. As for the present, cooperation is required between pedestrians, vehicles, and those responsible for directing traffic.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Endorses Blockade Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun said today that the Tokyo government fully supports the attitude, policy and plan of the Japanese authorities in Tianjin to blockade the British concessions. The Japanese government will not give up its policy of ensuring that Japan's goals are achieved. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of the Army Itagaki and Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita yesterday reported on the situation of the blockade of foreign concessions in Tianjin at a so-called inner cabinet meeting. It is reported that the cabinet decided that the Tianjin concessions will continue to be blockaded until the concession authorities formally recognize the changes after Japan occupied North China. Regarding the British implementation of economic sanctions against Japan, political figures here pointed out that if such a plan is realized, it would violate existing commercial treaties, and Japan would immediately take countermeasures. Japanese public opinion supports the government's tough attitude towards Britain and France, and all newspapers advocate continuing the blockade until the entire concession issue is resolved in principle and finally. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, today's cabinet meeting decided to maintain the actions of the Japanese authorities in Tianjin. Foreign Minister Arita reported to the cabinet that after the British side made representations regarding the Tianjin blockade incident, he replied that the matter should be resolved locally. He also advised the British government to take a cautious attitude and cooperate with the Japanese side to fundamentally resolve the issue. The British side expressed regret for the Japanese actions in Tianjin and requested an explanation of the proclamation issued by the Japanese military commander to blockade the concessions. He told them that he had not received a formal report from the Tianjin authorities, but felt that the matter should be handled locally. The semi-official side learned that the cabinet had also formulated a fixed policy for the government to proceed with this matter. It is reported that the cabinet made the above decision after hearing the report of Minister of the Army Itagaki. It is rumored that Itagaki claimed that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have adopted various appropriate plans with careful methods and firm determination. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Force Britain to Submit</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The words of semi-official newspapers and senior Japanese officials have clearly indicated that even if the British side completely concedes and hands over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the Tianjin issue cannot be resolved. The Japanese side here openly claims that the current movement is to force Britain to submit and cooperate with Japan to establish a new order in East Asia. A certain Japanese agency here is now very active in anti-British propaganda and has issued various slogans, such as "Chinese must completely withdraw from the British concession," "Do not trade with British shops and banks," "Recover the concessions," "To defeat the Nationalist government, we must first defeat Britain, Britain is exploiting our fat." Such leaflets are distributed throughout North China, especially in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news received here, the director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kawai, gave a speech in Changchun yesterday regarding the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, stating that the future "central government" of China will eventually recover the concessions, so the first step at present should be to completely reorganize the concession organization. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain, the United States and France are Exchanging Views</h3>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, the authorities of Britain and the United States exchanged information regarding Tianjin and Gulangyu. The attitude of the US Congress has been inclined to implement economic sanctions against Japan. British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, personally visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday, which is deeply worthy of attention. According to Hull's announcement afterwards, Lindsay came to the State Department only for a "social" visit. Both sides also talked about the situation in the Far East, and said that the US authorities had exchanged information about the facts with the British side. From this, it can be seen that the US government may cooperate with the British and French authorities stationed in China, but officials at the State Department are not willing to reveal its scope and limits. Hull then said that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Far East Fleet, had plans to go to Tianjin from Qinhuangdao, but he was unable to verify it at present, and the State Department also showed that he did not order Yarnell to go there. He said that US representatives in China had been ordered to cooperate with diplomatic officials from other countries in Tianjin and Gulangyu to handle various issues locally, and to automatically file protests when necessary. Also, since the concessions of Tianjin and Gulangyu have been blockaded by the Japanese army, there is no definite report on how it affects American citizens. Diplomatic observers here firmly believe that the Anglo-American consultation on the concession issue is the beginning of democratic countries jointly dealing with Japan. This trend can be seen from the proposition of implementing economic retaliation against Japan, and in fact, Japan is continuing to infringe on American interests in China. These diplomatic observers all hope that the US Congress can decide on steps to resist Japan. US Secretary of State Hull has already admitted to consulting with Britain on the Far East issue, which shows that the State Department attaches great importance to Japan's attempt to control the concessions. Also, Senator Wheeler (Democratic representative from Washington), an important member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is now demanding direct action against Japan. He told the Associated Press, "Taking a lenient attitude towards Japan is of no help to the facts," and said that if only diplomatic protests are made, it is by no means a permanent solution, and it is time to take direct action. Therefore, the only way to solve the problem is to ban the sale of arms to Japan. Finally, he declared that the current situation is sufficient to make the United States change its existing policy. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government today expressed concern about Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said here today while hosting journalists that the United States, Britain, France and Japan are exchanging views on the Tianjin incident in the capital, but he has not heard of any joint action by Britain, the United States and France. As for what he said yesterday that the US representative stationed in Tianjin would do what he could to ease the situation, he only meant that there was a possibility of intervention. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>British Study Retaliation Methods</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, sources close to the government here have stated that the British Cabinet will wait two or three days to observe whether the Japanese government will change its current attitude. If it remains stubborn at that time, Britain will economically retaliate against Japan, with the first step being the abolition of the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. This treaty stipulates most-favored-nation clauses. After its abolition, import taxes on Japanese goods can be increased and the quantity of imported Japanese goods can be restricted in an appropriate manner. The government has this intention. Today, Sir Inskip, Minister for the Dominions, has informed the High Commissioners of the various Dominions in London. The Ministry of Commerce is drafting a report on economic retaliation methods, which will be submitted to the Cabinet or the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion at the end of this week, and a decision will be made after considering the latest news from Tokyo. In addition, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has submitted a report to the government on his conversations with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita, stating that Foreign Minister Arita only noted the British views. Therefore, the current situation has not changed. In short, the Japanese government ministers are still deliberating. The concern is that the country may, within a few days, put forward specific demands in accordance with the statement made by the Japanese spokesperson in Tianjin, namely: (1) Britain should agree not to interfere with Japan's intrusion into China in administrative and economic matters; (2) Britain should cease assisting Chinese currency. If the Tianjin dispute is limited to the extradition of the four Chinese, a friendly solution would have been possible. If Japan puts forward significant demands in the future, resistance is essential, regardless of the cost. This is because, after making concessions in Tianjin, the issue of revising the entire concession system within China will arise, and the impact will inevitably lead to the loss of Britain's rights and interests and influence in China. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The House announced today that Labour MP Adams will question Prime Minister Chamberlain on June 19 as to whether the government, in view of the importance of the principles involved, will maintain the inviolable status of the British Concession in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Consulate Lodges Strong Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The blockade of the British and French concessions here has now entered its third day. What action will the British government take? This is the question on everyone's lips. Although the British expatriates in Tianjin are striving to remain calm and resolute, they are deeply concerned about the attitude of London. They eagerly hope that Reuters will transmit news that will help protect their rights and interests, because the lives and well-being of the majority depend on London's actions. The foreigners in the concession were initially shocked by the blockade, but are now gradually becoming accustomed to it. However, the food problem is causing anxiety. The amount of food entering the concession in the past two days has been minimal. The stalls in the vegetable market have nothing to sell, and the shops' stocks are gradually being sold out despite sharp price increases. The British Consul, Mr. Jamieson, has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General regarding the following three matters: (1) British citizens are subjected to searches when entering and leaving the British and French concessions; (2) On Wednesday, the Japanese side did not allow some British citizens, including two British soldiers in uniform, to leave the concession; (3) Armed Japanese soldiers and Chinese police intercepted and searched the tugboats of the British merchant Butterfield &amp; Swire Company. In his protest, the British Consul-General requested the Japanese side to immediately take measures to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future, and requested an immediate reply for transmission to his home government. Regarding the search of merchant ships, the protest stated that no one other than customs officials performing their duties has the right to board British ships. If the ship is a larger vessel or is towing barges at the time, sudden interception during navigation could lead to serious incidents endangering lives. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Advocate Firm Response</h3>
<p>(London) London newspapers are all publishing news of the Tianjin incident on their front pages. This morning's editorial in The Times stated that the British government has always responded to repeated Anglo-Japanese incidents with patience, believing that Japan would not cause further disputes with other countries when it encounters difficulties in its war against China, for its own benefit. However, regarding the issue of the policies of various countries in the Tianjin incident, Britain and other countries must not tolerate it again. The Yorkshire Post also stated that the Tianjin incident is not a local issue, and the disputes caused by aggressive countries in some parts of the world cannot be resolved by concessions. The only way to deal with it is to treat such actions as a disease and treat them accordingly. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) London newspapers today continue to have unusually激昂 editorials regarding the Tianjin incident, all advocating that the government adopt the most stringent sanctions against Japan. The "Daily Telegraph" declared that Britain cannot simply issue protests. Since Japanese provocations continue unabated, Britain must respond with severe retaliatory measures. The "Daily Express" called on the British public to boycott Japanese goods. The "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle" both demanded that the government take firm steps. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, sources close to the Foreign Office here stated that the British government had originally suggested that a committee of three, including a neutral country representative, be formed to handle the case of Japan's request for the extradition of the four Chinese involved in the Cheng Xigeng case. Although Japan misunderstood its nature and rejected it, Britain has not withdrawn this suggestion. Therefore, as of now, if Japan is willing to accept it, it can still be done. In addition, although the British government is exchanging views with the governments of the United States and France, it has not yet suggested to those countries that they jointly adopt economic retaliatory measures to deal with Japan when necessary. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, well-informed sources here stated that the British government now holds the view that if the Japanese authorities believe this matter is merely a local incident, there may still be hope for compromise between Britain and Japan to preserve each other's prestige. Conversely, if the Japanese authorities regard this matter as a preliminary step towards revising the concession system within China, Britain will take severe measures to limit the import of Japanese goods into all parts of the British Empire as a retaliatory measure. Generally speaking, negotiations between Britain and Japan will take another five or six days. If no compromise is possible by then, the British authorities will take economic retaliatory measures. At this time, the British and French authorities are exchanging views to determine a common attitude.</p>

<h3>British and French Naval and Military Representatives to Confer in Singapore, Asian Events Endanger World Peace, Allied Nations Strengthen Contact with Britain</h3>
<p>(London) During the debate on the expansion of armaments in the House of Lords this afternoon, Lord Davies, a Liberal Party member, spoke first, saying that it was inappropriate for Britain and France to continue supplying the Axis powers with scrap iron and other metals. For the present, the two countries should conclude an agreement with the British Dominions to restrict the export of various raw materials that could assist Germany and Italy in expanding their armaments. Lord Strabolgi, a Labour Party member, also spoke, expressing dissatisfaction with the matter, and said, "Today's events in Asia are sufficient to endanger world peace, far more than events in Europe. The British government has now taken various measures to deal with the difficulties with its French friends, which are late, but not too late. "Our General Staff should strengthen contact with the General Staffs of various allied countries. Seeing the events that have occurred in Asia, we know that cooperation with various possible allied countries is even more necessary." Recently, the Cabinet Gazette reported that the French naval and military delegations will be traveling to Singapore, and the British military delegation will also be traveling to French Indochina, which is gratifying. Admiral Chatfield, Minister for Coordination of Defence, then delivered a speech, concluding the debate, stating that the staff talks between Britain and various allied countries are important. I know that "this matter is currently in progress and will continue to be held." Especially since the military talks between Britain and various allied countries are after the military talks between Germany and Italy, its progress is naturally less than that of the German-Italian talks. "We are expanding our armaments in peacetime so that we can be prepared for any eventuality in the event of war. This standard of armaments will soon be reached." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Deutsche Bank Placed Under Hitler's Control, President Fully Responsible to Board of Directors, Foreign Share Capital All Repurchased at Price</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The government gazette recently published the German Central Bank Organization Law. According to the legislative procedure, it must be submitted to the General Assembly of Shareholders for approval on the 30th of this month before it is finalized. There are three noteworthy points in the grammar: (1) The Central Bank is completely placed under national sovereignty. The redemption method is stipulated for the shares currently held by foreigners (total share capital of 150 million marks, of which 35 million marks are held by foreigners). (2) The future policies of the Central Bank are based on the principle of authority. (3) The amount of paper money issued is no longer standardized by the preparation of gold or foreign currency, but is guaranteed by national production. As for the determination of currency prices, the power belongs to the Minister of Economy and President of the Central Bank, Funk. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government gazette recently promulgated a new financial decree, which states, "Deutsche Bank will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Führer Hitler from now on. The Führer's orders will be followed only in matters concerning German currency." Minister of Economy Funk also issued a detailed gazette to the press, clarifying the essentials of the Deutsche Bank's change of administrative structure, stating that, one, in addition to directly ruling the bank and its monetary policy, the highest amount of credit loans and treasury bills granted to the government by the German National Bank will also be decided by Hitler. The new decree authorizes Hitler to appoint the bank's directors, based on the principles of the National Socialist Party, with individual responsibility replacing collective responsibility. Therefore, the president of the bank is fully responsible to the board of directors. At the same time, the new decree stipulates the organization of two advisory councils for the president to consult at any time, composed of the heads of private banks, leaders of the business community, and celebrities in the financial community selected by the president. The share capital of the Deutsche National Bank was originally invested by private individuals. In the future, the shareholders of the bank must be German nationals of Aryan descent or legal entities residing in Germany. The bank's shares shall no longer be used for speculative purposes and the annual dividend is fixed at five percent. However, in order to compensate for the shareholders' losses, the bank's board of directors will announce compensation regulations on June 30, stipulating that the dividend this year can be increased to eight percent as in the previous year. The market price of the stock is fixed at 180, which is an increase of 1.5 percent compared to the market price of the bank's stock on the Berlin Stock Exchange last year. German shareholders holding 500 marks of old shares can not only exchange them for new shares of equal value, but also obtain treasury bills worth 400 marks. The bills will accrue interest from April 1, 1940. Foreign shareholders holding 100 marks of old shares can only exchange them for shares worth 200 marks from the discount bank. According to the Deutsche Bank's stock dividend, which was originally fixed at 12%, 8% will be paid in cash and 4% will be paid in bonds. In the future, the 4% bond dividend will be converted by the discount bank, and the cash dividend will remain the same. The 4% dividend converted by the discount bank will be directly guaranteed by the Deutsche Bank. In addition, the discount bank will pay a dividend of three marks per 200 marks of stock according to the new decree. After the bank issues new shares, the accumulated bond dividends will be exchanged for tax vouchers, which cannot be transferred. Foreign shareholders, regardless of whether they reside in Germany, may also exchange bonds for tax vouchers, except for those without nationality. People in the two protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia are entitled to the same treatment as German shareholders. Foreign shareholders are generally not allowed to transfer discounts in Germany, but may submit a transfer request if they wish to move out of the country. In other words, foreign shareholders will not have the right to transfer discounts for as long as they reside in Germany. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The King and Queen Depart Canada, Words of Fond Farewell, Watched by 150,000 People</p>
<p>Halifax The King and Queen arrived here at 3:00 p.m. today. The King was in his Admiral of the Fleet uniform and looked somewhat tired. Canadian Governor-General Tweedsmuir accompanied them. The King and Queen traveled by royal car throughout Canada, covering 8,000 miles. Today, they left the royal train and will board the "Empress of Britain" tonight to return home. After arriving here, the King broadcast a farewell address to the Canadian people in both English and French, expressing his gratitude for the welcome and hospitality he received and wishing Canada unlimited development in the future. He also said that the people of the Americas are all engaged in peaceful pursuits and have no worries about war, setting an example for the people of civilized countries on how to live and work in peace. The Queen also delivered a broadcast speech, expressing her gratitude to the people of Canada and the United States. Later, they boarded the ship and set sail amidst the cheers of 150,000 people. The King presented the Governor-General of Canada, Tweedsmuir, with the Grand Cross of the Victorian Order. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Halifax Harbor Sources close to the King and Queen said that the King and Queen's tour of the Dominion of Canada and their visit to the United States lasted 29 days and covered a distance of 15,000 kilometers. Everything went smoothly along the way, which is deeply gratifying to those who prepared for this event. It is said that the King and Queen have greatly won the hearts of the people both in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Canadian people say that the British government has achieved all the goals of the King's visit. In other words, relations between Britain and Canada have now been strengthened. A part of the Canadian people, who had originally intended to gradually separate from the British Empire, have also changed their attitude and support the Empire. In the future, if a second world war breaks out, Canada will be able to provide Britain with greater assistance. As for the United States, the King's visit has created a good impression on the people of that country, and even isolationists have no objections. It goes without saying that relations between Britain and the United States will become closer from now on. In short, the King's trip to the New World has made the people of English-speaking countries deeply understand that they have a bond in terms of interests and traditions. Although this relationship has not formed any special political bond, it can have a significant impact on the international situation in the shortest possible time. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

The statement also stated, "The actions of foreign spies are extremely obvious not only in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal area, and along the Pacific coast, but also along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf Coast. If our country must fully protect its national defense, we must not only increase federal officials to crack down on espionage activities but also increase government power to severely punish spies during peacetime." At the same time, Attorney General Murphy declared that FBI Director Hoover has been appointed as the person in charge of counter-espionage activities. He also declared that the anti-espionage precautions implemented on the West Coast last month have been extended to the Atlantic due to the international situation. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations</p>
<p>To Be Succeeded by Stark</p>
<p>(Washington) After Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, was ordered to be transferred to the Governor of Puerto Rico, the government has appointed Rear Admiral Stark to succeed him and awarded him the rank of Admiral. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>U.S. Amends</p>
<p>Neutrality Act</p>
<p>Isolationists Obstruct</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the amendment of the current Neutrality Act, twenty-one isolationist senators, including Republican Nye, Democrat Clark, and Borah, issued a declaration today stating, "Implementing the provision of cash-and-carry for arms exports is like burying one's head in the sand. Our country would be more honest to form an alliance with Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, or any other country that has a strong navy capable of controlling the oceans than to sell arms to them during wartime." In essence, we cannot condone the new Neutrality Act allowing the government to automatically lift the arms embargo during wartime and allowing belligerent nations to purchase arms from the United States. There is no room for compromise. The declaration is still seeking signatures from other senators. Republican Senator Johnson also suggested adding three points to the declaration: (1) The President shall not be granted any powers beyond those permitted by the Constitution; (2) In the event of war in the future, no one shall designate an aggressor; (3) If an arms embargo is to be implemented, it should be mandatory and impartial, applying equally to all belligerents.

<h3>British Colonial Secretary Explains Palestine Policy to the League of Nations; Laments the Immense Task of Fulfilling the Balfour Declaration; Does Not Take Sides With Either the Arab or Jewish People</h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Colonial Secretary MacDonald explained British policy in Palestine to the Mandates Commission yesterday, saying that Britain did not regard its work in Palestine as difficult but as a great undertaking of sympathy expressed by the drafters of the Balfour Declaration. Britain has spent millions of pounds implementing the mandate and lost many civil servants and soldiers in defense. Britain has suffered these hardships and losses in fulfilling its international responsibilities to the Jews and Arabs, which is as it should be. However, those who support the purpose of the mandate but do not bear responsibility should understand the difficulties encountered by Britain in carrying out this particularly arduous task. The constitutional provisions most suitable for preserving the important interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples have not yet been outlined. Although the administrative system is still undecided, it is necessary for both peoples to live freely according to their customs and beliefs. Only through this freedom can peace, friendship, and prosperity be restored and placed on a permanent foundation. The British government believes that its policy can achieve this goal in the near future, as the past animosity between the two sides is too deep and difficult to erase in a short time. However, the British government believes that its policy will inevitably lead people to turn around and face a great goal together. The British government's declaration of Palestine policy is the final action after deep consideration of the difficult problem. The British government has repeatedly tried to solve the problem without success. The Balfour Declaration is a promise made to the Jewish people and a guarantee made to the non-Jewish people. It is difficult to achieve a just solution without paying attention to these two obligations. Those who are involved in the Palestine debate either favor the Jews or favor the Arabs, which is enough to make the mandate unfair and lead to destruction. The British government and people have no partiality towards the demands of the Arabs and Jews. Britain treats the Arab and Jewish peoples equally. Past events are there, clearly documented. Britain's highest wish is to be fair to both sides and to help them live in peace and harmony. MacDonald continued that the term "National Home" used in the Balfour Declaration has a vague meaning. Great politicians such as Wilson and Smuts also recognized this possibility. The British government also believes so. This is why the term "Jewish state" was not used in the Declaration or the Mandate. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Suffers Losses in Shanxi, Casualties Reach 10,000; Chinese Army Recaptures Tumen; Fierce Fighting in Northeast of Maojin</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) After achieving a surprising victory in last week's counteroffensive, although the Chinese army has prevented the Japanese army from crossing the river, the Japanese army is now attempting to launch a new offensive in Shanxi Province. Among them, 3,000 Japanese soldiers advanced from Dakuan Village to the east and northeast of Maojin Ferry. The Japanese army in the Fencheng area north of Lvliang Mountain in western Shanxi and the Heilongguan area has increased. The Japanese army there is now moving south from Heilongguan, hoping to meet with the Japanese army in Shentou, west of Linfen. The fighting there is currently extremely fierce. Tumen, seven miles northwest of Linfen, has been recaptured by the Chinese guerrillas. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Fierce fighting has been going on in southern Shanxi for ten days, with the Chinese and Japanese armies locked in a stalemate in the Zhongtiao Mountains, fighting fiercely for every point and line. The Japanese army used fierce artillery fire to encircle the Chinese army from three sides, repeatedly bombing with aircraft, and releasing large amounts of poison gas, attempting to invade Maojin, Pinglu, and Ruicheng and the areas north thereof, cutting off the Longhai transportation line. In recent days, the Chinese army has been determined to fight to the death and finally defeated the Japanese army separately. The strongholds of Maojin, Pinglu, and Ruicheng on the north bank of the Yellow River are now all held by the Chinese army. The Japanese 10th Division and a part of the 37th Division have suffered heavy casualties, totaling 10,000 men. Since the 13th, the Japanese army, with 4,000 to 5,000 men and 38 artillery pieces, has launched four-pronged attacks east of the Zhangmao Highway. At the same time, the Japanese army at Henglingguan in Xia County pressed south, and 6,000 to 7,000 Japanese soldiers west of the Zhangmao Highway made a roundabout attack. The fighting has been extremely fierce in recent days, especially between the Chinese and Japanese armies east of the Zhangmao Highway, who have repeatedly engaged in hand-to-hand combat and are still fighting fiercely. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese army in Linfen has increased its forces in Tumen and Heilongguan, with a tendency to continue westward. The Japanese army in Heilongguan invaded Liujiazhuang, intending to cover the construction of bunkers between Heilongguan and Tumen. The Chinese army is attacking them. At 3:00 a.m. on the 15th, 300 to 400 Japanese soldiers in Xiwang Village (northwest of Linfen) invaded west in three routes. The Chinese army blocked them in Liufen Village and Shiwa Village, and defeated the Japanese army by 3:00 p.m. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: The Japanese army in southern Shanxi previously decided to launch a large-scale southern offensive. After being bravely repelled by the Chinese army, the Japanese army shifted its target and scurried towards the eastern Chinese road. On the morning of the 13th, more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers in Dakuan Village were divided into two groups, one scurrying to Dongxiyan Village and the other to Jiwang Guwang (northeast of Maojin). A battle occurred with the Chinese army. The Japanese army tried four times to break into the Chinese position but was repelled each time. After fierce fighting until noon, the Chinese army, due to heavy casualties, moved to the line of the Ma'an Bridge (all east of Jiwang) to continue fighting. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Southern Shandong</p>
<p>A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu: The war in southern Shandong is now progressing fiercely. The Chinese army encountered the Japanese army at Dali Village on the east side of the Qingyi Highway and encountered the Japanese army in the mountains on both sides of Mazhan. The Japanese army used eight aircraft to assist in the battle. Because the Chinese army occupied the superior mountainous terrain, they are still in a stalemate. On the 9th, the Chinese army fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Sanchakou and Chen Dian. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese army also made heroic sacrifices. (15th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The war situation in South China has not changed. The Chinese armies in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei are continuously harassing the Japanese in a proactive position.

It is said that Wang's resignation was due to poor health. However, well-informed Chinese sources claim that the main reason is that the Japanese side wants to appoint Wang Jingwei as the head of the Beiping "government." It is said that Wang's partisans are very active here. It is generally believed that the Japanese side plans to announce the reorganization of the "government," possibly on a federal basis, on July 7, the second anniversary of the start of the Sino-Japanese War.

It is reported that he carried a British passport, stating his nationality. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Construction of Chongqing Section of Southwest Highway; Traffic Obstructed</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to foreigners coming from Guiyang, traffic on the highway between Guiyang and Chongqing has practically stopped for the past few days because the river has risen sharply and bridges have been washed away by the water. A large number of trucks are blocked by the water at a certain point. Although there are primitive pontoon bridges and other things for crossing the water, only four cars can cross the water in an hour. However, the road workers are working very hard, working more than 14 hours a day. The government highway department is also able to work effectively, so it is expected that traffic will be fully open soon. Furthermore, according to transportation circles, although foreigners say that the Yunnan-Vietnam highway will be affected and impassable during the rainy season, transportation circles believe that there will be no problems in June and July, because there are still thousands of road workers along the entire road working day and night to strengthen the roadbed to avoid being threatened by water. Therefore, the entire line will be maintained. As for the new railway line from Guiyang and Guilin directly to Annam, it can be completed in October of this year. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>National Government Commends the Martyrdom of Staff and Students of Sichun School</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the National Government's order on the 16th, the Executive Yuan reported that when 2,000 to 3,000 enemy puppet troops attacked Zhao Jiatu and Li Jiadian in Hengshui in February of this year, the staff and students of the Sichun School in Hebei resolutely abandoned their pens and rose up in resistance, fighting the few against the many, and achieved many kills. Finally, due to the exhaustion of ammunition and no reinforcements, eight staff members including Li Xisun and forty-five students including Chu Shouzhueither died in battle or were seriously injured. They were all able to not be reckless in the face of danger and awe the enemy and puppets. It is proposed to give preferential awards and pensions. The staff and students were loyal and courageous in the face of disaster, sacrificing themselves to defend the country, which is worthy of being recorded in history. In addition to the Executive Yuan ordering the construction of a memorial tower and enshrining them all in the Martyrs' Shrine, and giving pensions as usual, they should be expressly commended and their deeds should be recorded and published in the National History Museum to show their heroism and encourage future generations.

<h3>Japanese Army in Zhenjiang Forcibly Drafts Young Men to Replenish Puppet Troops; Japanese Army Stationed in Zhenjiang is Made Up of Remnant Troops; Shipping and Commerce Are All Seized by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Japanese army stationed in Zhenjiang is constantly being transferred to various places to reinforce the suppression of guerrillas along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, so at present, the majority in the city are puppet "pacification troops" and puppet "police." The Japanese army is small. Feeling that their troop strength is insufficient, the Japanese army is actively and forcibly drafting young men in various districts, dividing them into two types: 18 to 25 years old and 26 to 45 years old. Those aged 18 to 25 are provided for training to replenish puppet troops, and those aged 26 to 45 are assigned to take on the role of "road guards" along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road. As a result, residents are constantly frightened and restless, and are moving and fleeing abroad. At the same time, after hearing this news, guerrillas such as the New Fourth Army are working harder to find ways to sabotage and obstruct the drafting. Therefore, the Japanese army's "drafting" work in various rural areas is not proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>The Japanese army occupying the towns and cities is now an organizational merger of remnants of several different numbered units, named the "Zhenjiang Garrison." Discipline is extremely poor. In the Ximen area, because military police patrol the streets, there are fewer extreme actions. However, in the Zhongshan Bridge, Xin Nanmen, Dongmen, Beimen, and Nanmen Xiaohuoche Station areas, which are remote and have no military police patrolling, there are frequent incidents of robbery of pedestrians' property or obstruction and humiliation of women. Men and women in the city and countryside all regard these areas as dangerous places to avoid. In addition, in the villages outside Xin Nanmen, farmers planted many trees. Recently, members of the puppet organization claimed that guerrillas could easily hide in the forests, so the Japanese puppets went to the countryside and cut down all the trees, loaded them back into the city, and some of them were used as fuel for the Japanese army, while others were privately sold by the puppet officials, and the villagers suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Below the Jiangyin blockade line, routes such as "Jiangling" and "Zhenyang" are now being operated by Japanese merchants dispatching ships. Small ports from Zhenjiang to Taiping'an, Zhongzhou, and Liuyi are also operated exclusively by the Japanese Qing Shipping Company. Foreign ships and Chinese ships are not allowed to interfere. As for land transportation, in addition to the Nanjing-Shanghai railway, the Zhencheng and Zhenyang highways have recently been repaired and opened to traffic by the Japanese army, which forcibly orders people to buy tickets and ride the buses. However, there are many guerrillas ambushed on both sides of the highway, and dangerous situations often arise. Residents do not dare to try it. Even the Nanjing-Shanghai railway trains are often delayed due to the constant sabotage of the tracks by guerrillas.</p>
<p>Since the summer of last year, more than 60 Japanese-owned foreign firms and sales offices, such as "Kowloon," "Inside and Outside," "Shimizu," "Marusan," and "Maeda 12," have been opened in the city of Zhenjiang. The streets and walls and telephone poles are covered with advertisements for Japanese goods, medicines, cotton fabrics, daily necessities, etc. Every Chinese store must sell one kind of Japanese goods. Now Japanese merchants are viewing Zhenjiang as a distribution center for goods. Nanjing-Shanghai trains and Japanese merchant ships in the river unload tax-evaded goods, piled up on the roads along the river, which cannot be counted every day. Chinese goods and Western goods are almost completely absent from the market due to various obstructions by Japanese puppet donations and taxes along the way. Therefore, at present, in various places in Zhenjiang, except for local products such as food, all kinds of commercial markets have been seized by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Daishan Levies Taxes and Opens Gambling Dens; Local Hooligans Participate in Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: The actions of the Japanese army in Daishan are reported as follows: 1. A salt tax collection headquarters was established in Dongshajiao, and Takeuchi I was appointed as the commander to forcibly collect salt taxes. 2. Commander You He Yinzou of the 1st Mine Sweeping Command extorted 20 young men and women from the puppet maintenance association on the 11th. 3. The Japanese army recently levied gambling taxes and set up gambling dens in Gaoting, hosted by Gao Asheng. 4. On the evening of the 10th, five residents of Dongshajiao planned to hire a boat to escape from Daishan and were discovered by the Japanese army and brutally killed.</p>
<p>Kunshan Puppet Government Forbids Rice from Leaving the Territory</p>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Kunshan is a rice-producing area. The annual output is considerable. At present, after years of war, farmers are fleeing together, and all the farmland in the county is almost completely deserted. The new grain harvested last autumn had an abundant output. However, the Japanese army ordered the puppet magistrate to announce that all rice and grain in the county were not allowed to be transported out of the territory. Therefore, all the rice stockpiled by the rice merchants could not be sold. Since there was no flexibility in circulation, there was naturally no profit to be made. Many people were affected by this and closed their doors and went out of business. At the same time, farmers also suffered considerable losses due to low rice prices. The reason why rice prices in Shanghai are soaring so much is that rice-producing areas are being monopolized by the Japanese army, so they cannot be transported to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Yangzhou Forcibly Drafts Young Men; Forbids Young Men from the North from Leaving the City</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Yangzhou has recently implemented the forced drafting of young men. All those aged between 10 and 45 are included in the draft. The puppet public offices in the city are required to notify the puppet square heads to circle five people per Bao. After repeated requests from the puppet square heads, the number of draftees in each Bao in the urban area was reduced by two, while the number of draftees in the rural areas remained the same. Since the implementation of this law, young people in the city have left one after another. The Japanese army has tightened inspections at the city gates and prohibited young men from leaving the city.</p>
<h3>Pinghu North Temple Tang Dynasty Scripture Copied, Already Seized by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Pinghu Correspondence: Pinghu North Temple, built in the Tang Dynasty, is a famous Chinese Zen Buddhist monastery. It contains two ancient pagodas, which housed all of the Tang Dynasty copied scriptures. Shanghai Buddhist believers contributed funds to rebuild the ancient pagodas in order to preserve them. During the recent fall of Pingyi, all of the famous families’ antiques, calligraphy, and paintings in the city were looted. The loss of cultural relics is incalculable. These Tang Dynasty copied scriptures, passed down to the present day, were also targeted by the puppet Education Bureau Chief Wang Lansheng, who suggested to the Japanese troops that the ancient pagodas be dismantled. All of the Tang Dynasty copied scriptures were also tied up and transported away, which is truly hateful.</p>
<p>Hengjing and Lili, Guerrilla Forces Active, Dozens of Puppet Soldiers Killed</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: In the Hengjing Miaogang area of Suzhou, on the evening of the 10th, a mobile team engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet pacification team's Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Squadrons. Dozens of puppet troops were killed. In the Lili area of Wujiang, three regular Chinese army steamboats arrived on the same day, towing more than forty civilian boats, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, small cannons, and other weapons. They encountered Japanese troops and engaged in a fierce battle. The sound of gunfire and cannons was very intense, lasting for three hours before it stopped. The Japanese troops were exhausted and greatly threatened.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Advance Towards Funing, Japanese Troops Repelled at Dalugang</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Funing are increasingly alarmed as the Chinese army advances to the Yellow River embankment area. Now, with reinforcements cut off, they are even more desperate. They only maintain communication between the west gate and Yangsaidian Lake in the Lian District. The other three gates (east, south, and north) are tightly closed, and civilians are prohibited from traveling to prevent Chinese army attacks.</p>
<p>At Dalugang in Funing County, on the morning of the 7th, three Japanese small motorboats were discovered, carrying over a hundred Japanese soldiers. They immediately attempted to land by force. The Chinese army dispatched a team to intercept them. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated back to the motorboats to flee elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Suzhou, People's Lives Difficult</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Since the soaring gold prices and sharp decline in foreign exchange rates in Shanghai, all industries in Suzhou have been greatly affected, especially Japanese businesses. For example, rayon, which used to be sourced from Shanghai, has risen to 400 yuan. No. 120 Golden Star rayon is now selling for 380 yuan, No. 15 retail is 370 yuan, and No. 120 Tianqiao rayon is 390 yuan. The price of cigarettes, such as Mei Li brand, has increased by 50 yuan per carton, and Hua Li by 40 yuan per carton, but there is very little stock available on the market. Lao Gu soap is already out of stock, relying solely on the new Gu soap from the Daimaru Yoko Japanese trading company in Changmen to meet the market demand. For example, Da Bai Yang soap is 9.40 yuan per carton, Xiao Bai Yang soap is 9.60 yuan, Huang Yang soap is 8 yuan per carton, and Xin Gu soap is 8.30 yuan per carton. The prices of all other daily necessities have also increased. The lives of ordinary people are filled with suffering.</p>

<h3>Overview of Physical Education in China (1): School Physical Education Compiling Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Although physical education in China has been promoted in schools and society for decades, the last ten years have been an important period in the development process. The main points of its past experience and the future promotion direction are briefly outlined as follows:</p>
<p>Physical Education Administration: In the beginning, there was no so-called administration of physical education in our country. It was not until August 21st that the Ministry of Education convened the first National Physical Education Conference, and the "National Physical Education Implementation Plan" was passed. After being revised and promulgated, the significance of physical education was gradually valued by the general public. The Ministry of Education then organized a Physical Education Committee in October of the same year as the highest design institution for physical education. Subsequently, in November of the same year, it set up a supervisor in charge of physical education to be responsible for execution and supervision. The following year, it ordered all provinces and cities in the country to organize physical education committees and add supervisors and physical education sections in charge of physical education in order to improve the national administrative organization and facilitate promotion. Unfortunately, a part of provinces and cities could not faithfully comply due to the difficulty of obtaining specialized personnel, resulting in a lack of universal and consistent development. Those who have established committees and supervisors have shown different images.</p>
<p>School Physical Education: Although schools took the lead in physical education, in practice, physical education in each school varied from person to person, making it difficult to produce a consistent effect. It was not until November 20th, when the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education organized a curriculum discussion committee for physical education in schools at all levels and promulgated the curriculum standards for physical education in schools at all levels, that there were some regulations in principle. Time and methods gradually became unified. In 23rd year, it further improved to seek uniformity in teaching materials, hiring experts to start editing the detailed teaching outlines for physical education for elementary, junior and senior high school boys and girls, which were published successively in 25th year to meet the needs of schools. However, the goal of school physical education cannot be satisfied by two or three hours of coursework per week. It is necessary to find ways to develop students' exercise habits from daily life. The Ministry of Education promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Compulsory Extracurricular Exercise in Primary and Secondary Schools" in 26th year, and the effect has been remarkable since its implementation. Social Physical Education In order to develop public physical education, the Ministry of Education has instructed provinces, cities, and counties to establish physical education grounds to provide the public with opportunities for exercise, promote sports competitions, and in April of 20th year, promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Amateur Sports Games of the Public," stipulating that each county should hold at least one event each year to promote it. For a time, the sports atmosphere in various places was greatly opened. However, in recent years, due to the invasion of foreign enemies, this kind of activity seems to have sharply reduced and should be maintained. The physical education of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors needs to be actively promoted and encouraged.</p>
<p>Sports Competitions: Ten years ago, except for a few schools (mostly church schools), very few sports competitions were held that were national in scope. In the 19th year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government held an exposition in West Lake and at the same time launched the National Games, which was a complete success. The government deeply felt the significance of promoting it, so the Ministry of Education ordered and promulgated the "Measures for Holding the National Games," stipulating that they should be held in the capital and other provinces and cities in rotation every year. The fifth and sixth sessions held in the capital and Shanghai in 22nd and 24th years respectively were held in accordance with this method.</p>

<h3>Finance Tightening of Credit Foreign Exchange Appears with Spot Arbitrage Forward, Swap Points Therefore Repeatedly Widened</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, due to the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions and Gulangyu, the conflict between Britain and Japan is intensifying. The British pound exchange rate softened, and the British-American exchange rate frequently retraced, resulting in a situation where the British pound was flat and the US dollar was tight at the market's opening. However, after recent foreign exchange fluctuations, general merchants are willing to pay higher interest rates to purchase and hoard commodities, leading to a gradual tightening of credit in the city. Chinese and foreign banks with foreign exchange spot positions are actively selling spot and buying forward, thereby swapping into legal currency, causing the forward market to suddenly tighten, with the tightness increasing the further out the term. Swap points are also widening. The situation is particularly severe for spot this month. External foreign exchange firms will take advantage of opportunities to sell spot and buy July futures, offering Chinese merchants an arbitrage of US$0.3125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 1.65%. In the afternoon, they again sold spot for this month and bought July futures, offering Chinese yarn and cotton merchants an arbitrage of US$0.1875, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 1.45%. However, in the spot market, although foreign firms had many settlements, external firms were quite willing to supply, so there was no significant impact. Most transactions were swap deals. As for the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, due to the continued strong selling interest from foreign firms, the market situation continued to ease.</p>

The US dollar depreciated against the British pound by 0.1875, against Shanghai by 0.06, and against France by 0.0125. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The opening spot selling prices for banks were 6 pence plus for British pound and 12.625 yuan for US dollar, slightly higher than the previous close, with the British pound flat and the US dollar tight by 0.03125, due to the continued depreciation of the British pound against the US dollar. After the opening, a Chinese bank, Guohua, sold July British pound futures to a foreign bank, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, at 6 pence plus 0.375. Subsequently, foreign banks mutually traded July US dollar futures at 12.0625 yuan. Then, foreign firms absorbed HSBC and Mercantile Bank spot British pound futures at 6 pence plus half a pence, and also purchased spot US dollar from a certain bank at 12.625 yuan. The spot and futures markets saw little change. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, they remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced at a slight 0.5%, calculated at 4.00%. At that time, Chinese banks mutually traded July British pound futures at 6 pence plus 0.3125. Later, an external firm sold spot and bought July futures, causing the futures market to tighten, but the spot market remained flat. The external firm offered Chinese merchants spot US dollar at 12.25 yuan, while simultaneously swapping into July US dollar futures at 12.3125 yuan, offering Chinese merchants an arbitrage of US$0.3125. Near noon, foreign firms again began to buy spot US dollar for this month from a certain bank at 12.5 yuan, and July US dollar futures at 12.125 yuan. Subsequently, the external firm, 安達力, sold spot Hong Kong dollar to a foreign firm, pushing it up to 43.75 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's cash gold market in the unofficial market showed an increasingly narrow range of fluctuations, with a difference of only eight yuan. However, the market trend was quite firm, as a certain gold firm (on behalf of speculators) and currency exchange businesses (on behalf of wealthy individuals) still had strong bullish sentiment. In addition, securities firms had ceased selling, and even showed some absorption. However, midway through, due to the competition between silver rights firms and cash firms to sell, the price once retreated to 2,582 yuan. Ultimately, due to bullish support, it rebounded to close at 2,590 yuan, resulting in a gain of five yuan. Trading was still active, with around a thousand taels traded. Jewelry gold remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold all rose in unison.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Only Increased by Five Yuan</p>

Only the蘇同崑帮 was nearly 3,000 bags, and it had been dry for more than a week, and a sweet rain suddenly fell, and the people were happy and safe, so the situation of early market openings was somewhat soft. Unexpectedly, the market is difficult to predict. Until noon, there was suddenly a large southern office guest pointed, and at the same time, the guests in this street took the opportunity to follow and accept various goods happily, resulting in a chaotic situation for a while, and a sudden tightness. The囤户 followed the wind and shadows, and also passed on to each other, shouting loudly, so as a result, the overall market situation, the fatigue was showing beauty. If the常粳 goods opened 19.8 yuan, and the重固 opened 19.3 yuan. The quotations of each goods have been increased by 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Transformation of Exchange Rate Equalization (Continued from 1st/1st)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>(2) The Exchange Market After the Establishment of the Equalization Fund</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund, the situation in the black market changed dramatically, and the sluggishness of the exchange market was swept away. For example, on March 8, it was very clear that there were more foreign exchange sellers, and on the 9th, there were more suppliers. The Tianjin help, which had always been known for its absorption, also had sales. The black market price rose from 8.125 and 15.84375 to 8.40625 and 16.4375 on the 10th. Afterwards, it fell back, but on the 17th, the market sent out the first activity of the Shen Ping準 Fund, and the market price immediately stopped at the 8.25 mark. HSBC also stated that it was willing to supply and sell foreign exchange at any time at this price. Subsequently, Tianjin claimed to have purchases, and commercial needs continued, especially the import of cotton was very large. Until the end of March, the exchange market situation was one of prosperous transactions and stable schedules. However, as usual, the supply meets the needs, and there is no twist. However, further observation shows that the merchants' desire for foreign exchange needs is like a bottomless pit, and the export bills are as rare as phoenix feathers. As a result, the market needs more than supplies, which is worth noting.</p>
<p>In April, the foreign exchange black market was long-term stable at the 8.25 pence water準, but there were slight changes in the futures aspect. For example, in the first half of the month, the near-term and far-term prices in the exchange market were almost flat. The difference between April and July was only 1/32 of a penny, and the swap difference for one month was only 1/128 of a penny. However, in the last week of the month, the swap difference for one month was 1/64 of a penny for the British exchange rate and 1/32 of a penny for the US exchange rate. It is impossible to know how much foreign exchange the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund supplied in April, but in the last week of the month, the settlement price of foreign cotton reached as much as £200,000 to £300,000. Although the exchange market is stable, the pressure on the exchange market is very high.</p>
<p>Turning to May, the China and Commercial Bank organized by the Japanese puppet organization was established. Japanese banks and the Tianjin gang secretly absorbed the spot and futures British and American exchange rates. They participated in the market's sales almost every day. HSBC and other banks were willing to supply small settlements for foreign firms, but were unwilling to supply huge settlements. Those who took advantage of the rally turned to attack the futures, but were also unable to achieve their wishes. This situation was seen in late April, and was even worse in early May. As a result, the trend of futures became tight and soft. When the difference between spot and futures was the largest, the arbitrage, excluding commissions, was about 8.6% per month. Later, due to the smooth transfer of supply sources, futures gradually approached the spot. It can be seen that the pressure on foreign exchange is increasing day by day, and it is really necessary to cope with it at 82.5 pence for a long time.</p>
<p>(3) Observing the Bottom of the 8.25 Equalization Price</p>
<p>The listed price of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market was 8 pence by HSBC since June 27, which was actually higher in the market. This year, the exchange rate before the establishment of the Equalization Fund was maintained at 8.125. After the establishment of the Equalization Fund, it was pegged at 8.25. However, it is not dare to speculate whether the 8.25 equalization price, which was discovered in the market on March 17, is really the exchange rate at the water準 that the Equalization Fund Committee believes is suitable for China's economic situation. However, the biggest reason why the Equalization Fund will maintain the supply of the market at 8.25 is probably to adapt to the environment at that time and the trend of the exchange market at that time, and did not consider the pressure on the exchange market. Assuming that the Equalization Association considered the pressure on the exchange market, it must have maintained the exchange market at 8 pence and above for the entire year, because it has been exactly one year since June 27th to the present.</p>
<p>The pressure on the exchange market, from the previous two chapters of observation on the exchange market, can be roughly said to be the needs of trade and the Japanese puppet's purchase. The trade needs are also indirectly making Japan gain foreign exchange. The analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese puppet's purchase, the methods adopted by Japan are various. First, the Jianghai Customs is now almost controlled by the Japanese army, and the customs revenue is entirely stored in the Japanese 行, so it is intended to exchange legal currency for foreign exchange. Second, in the broad Central China region, Japanese banknotes and military tickets are strongly exchanged for legal currency to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange. Third, the banknotes issued by the pseudo-organized bank are used to transfer legal currency and purchase foreign exchange. The earliest example is the "China United Reserve Bank" in North China, and the most recent example is the "China and Commercial Bank." Pseudo-钞 is fundamentally unprepared, so no matter how low the ratio of the value of pseudo-钞 to the legal currency is, as long as it has value, it can purchase foreign exchange. Therefore, these three aspects have a very large pressure on the exchange rate of the legal currency.</p>
<p>Regarding the needs of trade, the import surplus in the first four months of this year was about 4.5 million pounds in pounds. Among them, the import surplus in Shanghai was about 2.4 million pounds, accounting for one-half of the total import surplus. Therefore, the pressure on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market can be imagined. As mentioned earlier, trade needs are also making Japan gain foreign exchange, which is indeed the case. First, imports from Shanghai from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and "Manchukuo" totaled US$16 million in the first four months of this year, while exports from Shanghai to the above-mentioned regions totaled US$3 million. Undoubtedly, this difference of 1.3 million is of course sought in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Second, the amount of Shanghai flour sold to "Manchukuo" is very large, and its raw material - the import of wheat - is from the United States and Australia, and what is paid is foreign exchange, while the income of flour is Japanese yen, legal currency, and "Manchukuo currency." Third, cotton imports account for 20% of Shanghai's total imports, but 75% of the imported cotton is consumed by Shanghai's Japanese yarn factories, which indirectly gives Japan a way to obtain foreign exchange.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Northern Sales Stagnate, Yarn Prices Fall, There is no Shortage of Floating Longs to Close, Quotations Fall Again by Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market has entered a revolving state. Since the madness, the actual needs have not been fully developed, and they are all in the hands of hoarding and transshipment. Recently, the Tianjin concession has been sealed off, the northern sales have stagnated, and the market situation is even more tired. General wealthy people are still absorbing at low prices. In terms of this situation, the market is dragged by it, but the actual sales are still not smooth. However, the price of raw materials is high, and the Tianjin gang sells 10 coarse yarns.</p>
<p>The situation of the current yarn In the early morning opening, due to the serious problem of the Tianjin concession, the popularity of the people was depressed and the floating longs spit out and closed the opening price dropped by three or four yuan, the outer stack price of 20 double horse was 480 yuan, the stack single price was 476 yuan, after a while, the selling wind rose again, the market image was more frustrated, the good customer sales were weak, and the retail investors unloaded in view of the bad air, The outer stack price of 20 double horse 圾 low has been to 476 yuan and a half, the stack single price is 72 yuan, but the big households have not had any action, and there are still many drags, until the close, there are several bags of intake, and the market price has turned back by two or three yuan, the outer stack price of 20 double horse is 479 yuan, the stack single price is 74 yuan and a half, the afternoon opening is flat, followed by a multi-party buying again, for a while the situation is chaotic, the turnover is not strong, and in a flash the price is good for two yuan, the outer stack price is 482 yuan, The stack single price is to 76 yuan, but after a few buyers are rare, it will immediately return to loose, the close is still flat, the outer stack double horse price is 80 yuan, and the stack single price is 74 yuan, it is found that the statistics of each gang buying are 1,955 bags, and the transaction of the same industry accounts for 1,310 bags, the quotation of 20 pieces fell by 2 and a half yuan, the double earth rose by 1 and a half yuan, the goddess fell by 1 yuan, the shepherd fell by 2 and a half yuan, the five blessings fell by 3 yuan, and the amount of money bought by each gang is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Japanese yarn is lack of real needs, and the popularity is still good. The price of 20 Yueqin yarn this month is 402 yuan, which is 2 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cotton Trade: Foreign Cotton Rather Booming</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, especially New York cotton, showed a rather sluggish state yesterday. Due to sparse transactions at the opening, prices fell by three to five points. Discussions in Washington regarding the agricultural relief bill have yet to yield results, causing the industry to temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. In these turbulent times, the rise and fall of cotton prices depend entirely on political news from various parties. The fluctuating nature of the New York cotton market makes it difficult to grasp. Yesterday, the closing price of New York cotton fell by five to ten points compared to the previous day's closing. Indian cotton, along with forecasts, also decreased by one rupee. Egyptian cotton rose slightly by three to five points.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, transactions by factories have become increasingly quiet. However, there is a strong consensus among traders, with frequent buying and selling among themselves, making transactions quite busy. Yesterday, due to the softening of overseas cotton markets, traders still inquired with foreign firms about prices. However, there were no orders. The total turnover of foreign cotton traders yesterday was about 2,000 bales. It is expected that Japanese factories will start moving foreign cotton within the day.</p>
<p>Local cotton transactions remain clear. However, the Japanese-owned Yufeng Factory continued to import 400 bales of American upland cotton. Other factories did not have much trading. However, the buying and selling of Indian cotton among traders has resumed flourishing. This business is resold to Japanese factories for offsetting transactions, so the selling price is increasing daily. Tongzhou local cotton has reached 90 yuan for delivery at the wharf, and Dachongji is even selling at 110 yuan. This is a distorted price development, a situation unseen in the history of the cotton industry. The supply from northern Jiangsu remains low, with only 108 bales of Xiassha cotton arriving at the docks. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>American Upland Packed 102.00 Yufeng Factory Import 400 Bales Cash to Factory</p>
<p>Bairochi 95.75 95.00 Trader Import 400 Bales Cash at Wharf</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Declining</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's market was still affected by the concession issue, with people uneasy. Both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions significantly decreased. Small retailers offered reduced prices for plain white cloth and coarse cloth, with some being transferred out. The market price fell by five cents to one dime per piece. Wholesale shops and hoarders on this street continued to handle over 3,000 pieces of dyed blank twill. Dyed and bleached cloth remained strong in the market, especially for autumn and winter goods. Transactions of thread, wool, serge, printed flannel, and other goods by wholesale shops and hoarders on this street continued with bulk deals being settled. Customers from Guangdong and Zhejiang continued to purchase over a hundred boxes of cheap selections, as well as fifty to sixty boxes of colored twill, thirty-plus boxes of colored cloth. Buyers from Sichuan and Yunnan handled over three thousand pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Buyers from Pucheng in northern Fujian handled over a thousand pieces of wool and colored twill. Buyers from Taizhou and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu handled eight hundred pieces of colored cloth and fine cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: Yesterday, the spot prices of fine cloth and fine twill continued to soften, mainly because traders from Tianjin were still selling in the market. The morning market price of Longtou fine cloth fell to 14.20 yuan, and the later market price for this month returned to 14.35 yuan. The trading companies still haven't opened their goods. Fine twill also continued to fall by five cents to one dime. However, dyeing sales on this street and transactions among traders still amounted to about a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Coal: The Price of White Coal Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Increased by Nine Yuan in One Week</p>
<p>The white coal market is soaring. Although actual transactions are not brisk, buyers are quite firm. Yesterday, Hongji white coal was quoted four yuan higher again, with traders quoting 54 yuan per ton. In one week, the price has been raised three times, increasing by as much as nine yuan per ton. Hongji No. 1 dust is 30 yuan per ton, and No. 2 dust is 27 yuan. The above prices are for self-pickup at the warehouse, and delivery requires additional handling fees.</p>
<p>Seafood: Yantai Dried Scallops Continue to Be Sold</p>
<p>Yantai dried scallops have recently continued to arrive. Sales started yesterday. High-quality dried ones are 145 yuan per picul, and Chaozhou goods are 235 yuan. The market is slightly better.</p>

<h3>The Secret Key to Obtaining Happiness in Marital Life</h3>
<p>In this modern age of medical and physiological advancements, the secret chamber of love has provided us with a key, allowing us to enter and examine the palace of truth at any time. The "hormones" within each person's body, secreted from one organ, affect other organs, affecting the entirety of an individual's life functions, and even more so in the lives of both sexes, affecting everything about the opposite sex, which also requires this kind of influence. Therefore, from the perspective of the lives of both sexes, women are merely a part of men, and men are merely a part of women. Only the combination of men and women can form a complete whole person.</p>
<p>In the lives of both sexes, the union of two people can not only satisfy the mutual desires of both parties, but also produce a kind of "wonderful creation" from this union. This creation not only refers to the children born from the love of men and women, but also refers to all kinds of supernatural entities arising from the complete integration of men and women. After both parties are bound by the threads of love, they become something new, completely different from when they were separate.</p>
<p>A young man and a young woman are moved by the attraction of almighty love, as if there is another vast and beautiful world before them, which can increase their various abilities, which cannot be measured by people who usually live alone. This is so glorious, great, and happy.</p>
<p>However, the number of truly happy men and women in the world is too small. Most people are mired in pain, and although there are many reasons for this, the English writer Mrs. Stopes said it all in one sentence: "If one were to properly study all aspects of marriage, one could achieve immortal achievements, and some people have done such research, but they all linger in the hazy darkness of abnormality, thus neglecting the needs of healthy, passionate people." Her meaning is that healthy passion is the secret key to happiness in the lives of both sexes.</p>
<p>Men and women in the world, because they do not know this secret key, either masturbate to induce nocturnal emissions before marriage, or indulge excessively after marriage, or even seek pleasure and cut themselves short, resulting in the loss of essence and blood. Therefore, symptoms such as forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, sore waist, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, and prolonged infertility arise one after another. If a husband is unable to fulfill his responsibilities for a long time, he will inevitably be resented by his wife, and the lives of both sexes will fall into a painful situation. The only way to remedy this is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence." This medicine can generate sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and invigorate the blood within 24 hours after taking it. The medicine is mild in nature and has the greatest effect. The above symptoms can be guaranteed to be treated in a short period. However, if patients have nocturnal emissions, they must also take "Hemet's Semen-Preserving Tablets" to consolidate the seminal gate and stop leakage. Being able to open sources and reduce expenditure will surely yield even more miraculous results!</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>The Breasts Are the Key to Female Beauty</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Soft breasts and arms, adorned like jade,</p>
<p>Full breasts and buttocks are the most glorious sight,</p>
<p>No wonder everyone loves them so much,</p>
<p>Selecting a new husband who suits their heart.</p>
<p>Aside from the old-fashioned, blind marriages that have been abandoned, modern men choose their spouses based on the other person's "sound physique" as the primary factor. As for their appearance, learning, and character, these are only secondary issues. From the perspective of us medical experts, this view is very important, because the entire undertaking of life, family happiness, and the strength of offspring are all directly or indirectly related to physique. If a wife has a sound physique, she can not only help her husband start a business and build a family, but also in the private life between husband and wife, she has fervent passion, which can also make her husband happy and joyful, and his spirit can obtain unlimited comfort. The family will be full of joy and give birth to clever children, and their happiness will be boundless.</p>
<p>But let's be clear. What counts as a sound physique for a woman? Many people do not yet have a full understanding of this point, but in the eyes of intelligent men, this is something that can be known at a glance. In general, a woman's sound physique can be determined by looking at her breasts and buttocks. If a woman's breasts are raised high and elastic, and her buttocks are plump and round, it can be determined that her gonadal ovarian function is healthy, her metabolism is vigorous, and her whole body is full of new cells. Naturally, she has no hidden diseases. On the contrary, if her breasts are withered, her buttocks are thin, and she has lost her beauty, then she has either committed self-abuse and chest binding, or suffers from menstrual irregularities and leucorrhea. Even if she has a face like a flower, she will be despised by modern men, and her fate will be very tragic! To seek remedy, one must only trust in science. According to world-renowned gynecologists and my own experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation "Germinal Essence" for women is the most appropriate and effective treatment. This preparation is carefully formulated. After taking it for one day and night, it can cultivate ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation and produce seeds, and in a short period of time, it can make the breasts rise, the buttocks plump, the cheeks rosy, and youth lasting.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Can Cause Physical and Mental Weakness</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Thanks to the advancement of medicine, we now know that the gonads in the endocrine system are extremely important to our body. The endocrine secretions of these gonads, in childhood, are irrigated throughout the body through blood circulation, presiding over the development of our body's appearance and weight. When spring feelings are aroused, a portion of these gonadal secretions are injected into the seminal vesicles to perform reproductive functions. If young people are unwise and cannot control the sexual impulses caused by the stimulation of these glands on the mind and body, or commit self-abuse, or indulge excessively in early marriage, leading to repeated nocturnal emissions, then these glands will inevitably be depleted due to massive consumption, and then the developmental function will stagnate, the metabolism will decline, and even though they have reached adulthood, their whole body will be like a child's. Furthermore, their face will be sallow and thin, their body and spirit will be withered, and their age will be young, but they will already be in a state of aging.</p>
<p>Therefore, young people must eradicate nocturnal emission as soon as possible. If they delay treatment or allow it to turn into spermatorrhea, not only will the above symptoms be unavoidable, but I am afraid that symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, sore waist, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, energy dissipation, thin sperm, and infertility will come one after another. Such young people will be abandoned by the opposite sex in the arena of love due to their withered body and spirit, unattractive appearance, and will fall into a tragic situation of unrequited love. Even in the marital life after marriage, it will not be satisfactory, and family life will be even more painful! At the same time, in today's fiercely competitive society, there is only the survival of the fittest, and they will be eliminated! To seek remedy, one must take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emissions, "Hemet's Semen-Preserving Tablets," to consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and allow for a sound sleep at night. Nocturnal emissions can be stopped immediately on the same night. If the patient already has the above symptoms due to nocturnal emission and indulgence, they must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, promote developmental function, and invigorate metabolism. If they can continue to take it, they will surely recover their beautiful health and be cured of all diseases! If patients come to my clinic for electrotherapy and injections, they can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>

<h3>Special Treatment Method for Redness, Swelling, and Pain in Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>In the acute phase of gonorrhea, the glans and foreskin become red, swollen, and painful due to the irritation of the gonococcal toxin, which is a common symptom in the acute phase. The area around the urethral orifice of the patient is bound to become red, swollen, and painful. The severity of these symptoms is always related to the intensity of the gonococcus. If the toxicity is strong, the lower part of the urethral orifice, both sides of the frenulum of the penis, and even the entire foreskin, will show edematous swelling with a shiny appearance, accompanied by pain. However, the fluid accumulated in this swelling is similar to hydrocele of the scrotum and is not pus. If the disease has reached this point, the invasion of the toxin has spread to the paraurethral ducts, glands of Littre, and follicles. If these areas are indeed invaded by the toxin, then millet-sized to pea-sized swelling and induration will occur in these areas, which can be detected by palpation. As a result, the urethral cavity is obstructed and narrowed by this induration, making urination even more difficult.</p>
<p>To detect these conditions, a detailed examination should be performed with a new-style urethroscope to understand the true nature of the disease. Then, German Filtrin Pingliu electrotherapy is used to directly transmit to the lesion. Gonococci in the paraurethral ducts cannot be eliminated by local surgery alone. Only Filtrin electrotherapy can penetrate deep into the lesion. On the one hand, chemical therapy and specially made autogenous vaccines are used as injectables. In this way, all inflammatory and swelling symptoms will completely subside within one week, and the urethral induration can also be eliminated and restored to its original state in two weeks. This treatment method is the crystallization of my experience of more than ten years.</p>

<h3>The Dragon Boat Festival is Approaching: All Industries are Processing Accounts: Banks and Money Shops are Busy with Collections and Disbursements, Discount Rates Rise Sharply, But the Overall Financial Market Remains Stable as Ever</h3>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and all industries are starting to process accounts. For accounts within the city, invoices have been issued and collections are being urged. For accounts in other cities, the Chamber of Commerce issues certificates and dispatches personnel to collect them separately. The collection and disbursement of banks and money shops is busy due to the Dragon Boat Festival. The interbank lending rate in the market has risen to two cents, but yesterday it has fallen to 1.7 cents. The high interbank lending rate in the market is sufficient to prove the urgency of credit. The main reasons are: (1) The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and all industries need to cope; (2) The black market exchange rate is tight, and firms hoard goods for profit; (3) Wheat, tea, and spring silk are entering the market, and all industries are preparing funds for purchases. As for the overall finance, it remains stable as ever. There is still a surplus of funds in the Shanghai market, and it is still difficult for banks and firms to use them. Good investment avenues are still narrow. The discount work of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural is proceeding as usual, with the aim of adjusting finance and supporting the development of all industries. As of the end of April, the loan balance was over 140 million yuan. Loans directly issued by the association accounted for 92% of the total amount, loans handled by the Bank Joint Reserve Committee accounted for slightly less than 4%, and loans handled by the Money Shop Joint Reserve accounted for slightly more than 4%.</p>
<p>Danish Consul General Acts as Senior Consul</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently received a notice stating that the Italian Consul General and Senior Consul Nilo would be temporarily leaving Shanghai from the 18th of this month. At that time, the duties of Senior Consul will be performed by the Danish Consul General Scheel.</p>
<p>Two British Ships Sail to Tianjin Today</p>
<p>Passengers Disembark in Tanggu After Arriving in Tianjin</p>
<p>Since the British and French concessions in Tianjin were blockaded by the Japanese army on the morning of the 14th, British ships going to Tianjin from this city have stopped loading goods. Jardine Matheson's Ding Sheng was scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin the day before yesterday (the 15th), and all the Tianjin goods that had been loaded in advance were temporarily returned to customs, as reported in the previous newspaper. Today, two ships, Taikoo's Shengjing and Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng Xin, are scheduled to depart for Tianjin at 10:30 am. The Shengjing is only carrying some goods for Qingdao and Yantai, and no Tianjin goods at all, not even Tanggu goods. However, the Yong Sheng Xin is still carrying several thousand bags of Tanggu flour. Passengers are still allowed, but they must disembark in Tanggu. Therefore, the situation in the Tianjin concession remains tense.</p>
<h3>To Remedy the Coin Shortage in Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance Has a Fundamental Solution: It Will Approve the Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes for Circulation: The Issuance of Vouchers by Businesses Will Be Discontinued: The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Seeks Opinions</h3>
<p>Copper coins and copper cash in the Shanghai market are extremely scarce due to being hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for profit, making it extremely inconvenient for small transactions in various industries. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request a quick remedy. Today, the Ministry of Finance has approved the shipment of new subsidiary currency to Shanghai for relief. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from banking circles that the Ministry of Finance has determined a fundamental relief method for the shortage of copper coins in Shanghai: it will approve the issuance of fractional currency notes by banks, which is the same method used to deal with the shortage of copper cash in the interior. However, the fractional currency notes in the interior are issued by provincial banks or local banks. In Shanghai, they are to be issued by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural. It is still impossible to find out the details, but the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank said that it has not received any telegram orders from the Chongqing headquarters regarding the shipment of new subsidiary currency to Shanghai and the issuance of fractional currency notes for circulation. As for the plan for various businesses to issue their own vouchers, because the Ministry of Finance has a remedy, they will all be discontinued. The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, the commercial center of this city, believes that since the reduction of copper cash and one-cent coins, both citizens and businesses have felt difficulty. It intends to print a temporary voucher for distribution to various businesses on Nanjing Road for use in making change. Once the government's new subsidiary currency arrives in Shanghai, this temporary voucher will be canceled. To be cautious, the association has sent letters to various businesses yesterday seeking opinions, with items such as "extremely necessary" and "still manageable" in the inquiry letter, asking the businesses to check and reply within three days so that a decision can be made. As for the name of this temporary voucher, whether it is a voucher or another name, it remains to be discussed and decided. Since the wave of copper cash shortage began, various road public groups have, at the request of businesses, had discussions on issuing temporary vouchers. However, opinions from various parties are divided, as it is feared that unscrupulous people will imitate and deceive, leading to more malpractices and making it difficult to handle the aftermath. However, the efforts of business groups to reduce the difficulties of merchants are worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Cixi Urban Area Bombed Again</p>
<p>Ningbo Also Has Air Raid Alarm: Japanese Planes Also Enter the Teeth</p>
<p>Cixi was bombed by Japanese planes in the ordnance area on the 1st of this month. After an interval of only two weeks, Japanese planes bombed Cixi City again at noon on the 14th. On that day, there were four Japanese planes taking off from Longshan on the sea in Zhenbei, and they dropped a bomb at the foot of Longshan Mountain, with no losses. After circling once, the Japanese planes attacked the Cixi urban area, dropping bombs successively in the west of the city, at Yongming Temple, and at Cixi Middle School on the bank of Cihu Lake in the northern suburbs. Dozens of houses were destroyed, and the number of deaths and injuries is unknown. After wreaking havoc, the Japanese planes fled back along the original route. When the Japanese planes bombed Cixi that day, Ningbo also issued an air raid alarm, followed by an emergency alarm. Later, because the Japanese planes did not enter the territory, the alarm was lifted at 12:12 pm.</p>
<h3>Columbia University Professor's Impressions of Visiting Western China: Praises the Great Spirit of the Chinese People: Discovers the Determination for Long-Term Resistance Everywhere</h3>
<p>Columbia University Professor Auchter, author of famous works on Far Eastern events, recently returned to the United States via Shanghai after visiting western and northwestern China with his wife. Professor Auchter recently made a broadcast speech to the United States in Chongqing, stating that China in 1932 was very different from China today, and that China had the ability to continue resisting Japanese aggression. A few days ago, I came to Huaxi, Sichuan Province, from Hong Kong, hoping to find out how a country that has suffered heavy losses can resist aggressors. Now I have found the answer here in Chongqing. Chongqing used to be the commercial export center of Sichuan Province. Now it suddenly became</p>
<p>Wartime China</p>
<p>The political center of Within a few months of abandoning Hankou, the population increased from 250,000 to over 500,000. Overcrowding is inevitable. Construction of government offices, residences, factories, and university buildings is underway everywhere. Whether building houses or air-raid shelters, the ground must first be leveled manually. Therefore, the sound of hammering and chiseling to remove</p>
<p>The sound of sandstone</p>
<p>Is endless, In addition to cars, rickshaws, and shoulder carriages on the streets, there are also coolies and handcarts transporting the necessary building materials, so pedestrians and vehicles are constantly flowing. Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces are not only the base of political activities, but also the area of ​​industrial revolution. The mineral and industrial resources are now under investigation. The factories that were suddenly moved out of the war zone are also being rebuilt. I have visited several factories and am impressed by their attitude of overcoming insurmountable difficulties.</p>
<p>Quite surprised</p>
<p>It should be known that the equipment of the factory was transported after trekking thousands of miles. At the same time, handicrafts are encouraged to supplement the lack of factory industry. Now I do not want to give the audience the impression that China has solved its economic difficulties. On the one hand, China continues to rely on the self-sufficient economy of these three provinces. On the other hand, it recruits people from other provinces to supply the army, export surplus products, establish foreign exchange, and rebuild a new economy that cannot be completed in one day and night from within. China also needs to obtain more from the outside world than it currently has.</p>
<p>Greater assistance</p>
<p>I found the spirit of the people of Chongqing to be more profoundly impressive than the material achievements. They did not talk about concessions or peace talks. Everywhere I encountered, they were optimistic and had a calm determination to resist indefinitely. I cannot praise the great spirit of the Chinese people in words. The unity produced in the war was not seen when I went to China in 1932. Provincial boundaries have been completely eliminated, and a magnificent and powerful national spirit is being forged. Our feeling is that China is a country of 500 million people who refuse to be conquered.</p>
<p>Occupational Guilds Evacuate Refugees</p>
<p>The Board of Directors will meet today</p>
<p>The International Sixth Shelter was originally located in the Qianye Guild Hall at the intersection of Beihainan Road and Haining Road, which housed more than 600 refugees, women and children, from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Now, the Qianye Guild Hall plans to convert the place into a hospital and school, and has issued a notice preparing to evacuate the refugees in the shelter. The refugees in the shelter have launched representatives Ma Nanshan, Shen Liangjun, Ye Yangwu, etc. to petition Qianye leaders Qin Runqing and others to show compassion for the refugees and exempt them from relocation. It was learned yesterday that the Board of Directors of the Qianye Guild Hall has scheduled a meeting today to discuss and decide on the relocation of the shelter.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Transport to Shanghai Blocked; Silk Factories Completely Shut Down; Failure to Deliver June Futures as Agreed; "Central China Company" Attempts to Dominate China's Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Since the "Central China Silk Company" abandoned collecting cocoons in villages and towns and permitted Shanghai manufacturers to set up shops to collect cocoons in villages and towns, various factories, in order to maintain operations, have risked buying spring cocoons from various places. Now, the cocoon season in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has passed, and cocoon shops have successively stopped weighing cocoons. Just as manufacturers were preparing to load cocoons onto vehicles for transport to Shanghai, they were suddenly blocked by the "Central China Company." After various manufacturers negotiated with the "Central China Company," the company initially agreed to handle the matter after its Japanese general manager returned to Shanghai from Japan. Now, although the Japanese general manager has returned to Shanghai, the blocked cocoons have still not been released.</p>
<p>Shanghai Factories Forced to Shut Down</p>
<p>There are thirty-six silk reeling factories within the concession area, all of which had fully commenced operations. Later, due to a shortage of raw material cocoons, they were forced to shut down one after another. It was originally planned to resume operations after the spring cocoons came on the market, but now, because the cocoons they collected are blocked, and their existing cocoon stock has been exhausted, only a few factories, such as Jardine, Yue Hing, Fook Lun, Zhen Lun, and Shanghai, are勉强勉强operating. All other factories have completely shut down. Even those factories that are勉强勉强maintaining operations have a limited amount of raw materials. It is expected that if the problem of transporting spring cocoons to Shanghai is not resolved before the end of this month, all silk factories in Shanghai will be forced to shut down completely.</p>
<p>Failure to Deliver Futures; Disputes Arise</p>
<p>According to past practice, silk factories sell futures contracts for silk produced after the spring cocoons come on the market to foreign firms engaged in the export of Chinese silk. After each factory collects spring cocoons, they reel silk and deliver the goods according to the contract. Factories in the Shanghai concession have sold a considerable amount of June and July futures contracts. Now, because the transport of spring cocoons to Shanghai is blocked, various factories are unable to start reeling silk, and the futures contracts that should be delivered on time cannot be fulfilled as agreed. As a result, minor disputes have arisen between manufacturers and foreign firms. However, because the manufacturers are helpless and the situation is beyond their control, the foreign firms have agreed to postpone delivery until the spring cocoons are released.</p>
<p>Attempt to Dominate China's Silk Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, China's silk reeling industry has shown signs of revival, which the Japanese are extremely jealous of. Now that the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been occupied, they are naturally doing their best to suppress the industry, attempting to dominate China's silk business. The current obstruction of spring cocoons being transported to Shanghai is one of their policies. Currently, in addition to trying to start silk reeling operations in factories in Wuxi, the "Central China Company" is further attempting to seize silk factories in Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Haining, and other places. This is ostensibly called cooperation, but in reality is seizing control. At the same time, they are also attempting to monopolize the European and American silk markets.</p>
<h3>Speculators Manipulate Rice Prices; Nearing the 20 Yuan Mark; Hope Authorities Take Strict Measures to Crack Down; Also Dredge Sources to Maintain Food Supply for the People</h3>
<p>Due to the manipulation of speculators, the price of rice in the Shanghai rice market has soared, breaking the 19-yuan mark. After the Market Management Committee advised the speculators, the market stabilized slightly the day before yesterday, and the speculators accepted the advice and released their hoarded rice. However, after the market opened yesterday, speculators took the opportunity to buy back in, causing prices to rise again. Top-grade white rice was 19.8 yuan, nearing the 20-yuan mark. The price of rice in the market has been manipulated by speculators, and the rise and fall of prices depends entirely on the buying and selling of speculators. If this continues, it will greatly affect the people's food supply. Various rice industry associations have stated that, under special circumstances, cracking down on speculators is beyond their power. They can only hope that the concession authorities will formulate measures to curb speculation and also dredge the prevention of rice from being exported from production areas.</p>
<p>Sweden Celebrates the King's Birthday</p>
<p>Swedish Consulate Hosted a Banquet Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that Swedish King Gustaf V is celebrating his 81st birthday today (the 16th). The Swedish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Cronwall, hosted a banquet at his residence at No. 101 Route Massenet, starting at 7 p.m. tonight, to celebrate with the Swedish community in Shanghai. It is noted that the Swedish King ascended the throne in 1907.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Arrested More Than a Dozen Chinese in Zhabei Yesterday; Allegedly Related to Certain Unstable Cases</h3>
<p>For days, Japanese troops have been wantonly arresting Chinese residents in the occupied areas, such as Hongkou and Zhabei, and detaining them for interrogation. The details of the cases are not made public. Yesterday morning, at around 9 a.m., more than a dozen Chinese, who looked like coolies, were arrested by Japanese troops and plainclothes detectives in a shed on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. At the same time, they also conducted searches in the surrounding area, but reportedly found nothing. It is said that some of these dozen Chinese are suspected of being involved in unstable cases and were arrested due to informers.</p>
<p>Ding Le Case Continues to be Investigated</p>
<p>Testimony from Two Witnesses</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the British Coroner Haynes continued the inquiry into the Ding Le case this morning (the 16th). Mr. Grant, an engineer at the Lun Chang Company, testified that he saw about thirty striking picketers on the pontoon from the office building of the Lun Chang Textile Factory. He rushed to the factory gate and saw Japanese marines, led by a sergeant, climbing over the wall from the adjacent courtyard into the Lun Chang Factory. They opened the gate to allow striking workers and good workers who arrived at the same time to enter the factory. As soon as they entered the factory, the Japanese soldiers separated the strikers from other workers. At a shout, the strikers rushed to the headquarters of the factory. The witness tried to stop the strikers to prevent the good workers from being harmed, but he was stopped by the Japanese sergeant, who said that both striking and non-striking Chinese workers must be taken away. The witness went to close the factory gate and, when he returned, saw Mr. Ding leaving the factory, led by Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Another Witness</p>
<p>Lubetzky, a supervisor at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, testified that he saw a Japanese soldier stab Mr. Ding in the lower left body with a bayonet, while other Japanese soldiers were beating Mr. Ding in front. At this point, the Coroner adjourned the court and scheduled the hearing to resume at 2:15 p.m.</p>

<h3>Shipping Increasingly Prosperous; Shortage of Floating Docks in the Huangpu River; Foreign Ships Loading Foreign Wheat from Australia; Must Wait Three or Four Days Before Entering the Port</h3>
<p>Floating docks are important facilities for ships. The city's Huangpu River banks are lined with docks, and there are also many floating docks in the river. Starting from outside the Garden Bridge and extending to the Donggou River surface, the Customs has established forty-four floating docks. From the Bund near 16 Pupu to the Rihui Port on the Huangpu River in the south, the Public Security Bureau's dock warehouse management office has also established more than twenty floating docks, as well as floating docks set up by the China Merchants, Taikoo, and Jardine companies. Therefore, there has never been a worry about ships being unable to enter, moor, or dock.</p>
<p>Pudong Blockade; Cannot Dock</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the docks and floating docks south of 16 Pupu have been blockaded and cannot be used for docking. On the Pudong side, the Taikoo Wharf in Yangjiadu, the Hongxing Wharf, the British Longmao Wharf, and the Qichang Wharf and Blue Funnel Wharf to the east have resumed docking. Customs floating docks No. 1 to No. 8 and No. 36 to No. 44 are still occupied for military use.</p>
<p>Increased Number of Incoming Ships</p>
<p>Due to the recent increase in the number of incoming ships loading foreign wheat and foreign cotton, there is a shortage of floating docks for docking. Sometimes, there is no space at the docks and floating docks, and ships have to wait three or four days outside Wusong before entering the port to unload cargo. This loss is also considerable.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships to Shanghai; Temporarily Anchor Outside the Port</p>
<p>Recently, the Sithonia and Mount Helmos, two ships managed by the Tianxiang Shipping Company, arrived from Australia with 16,000 tons of foreign wheat on the 6th of this month. Because there was no space at the docks and floating docks in the Huangpu River, they anchored outside Wusong to wait. They only entered the port to unload the wheat on the 9th and 11th. Now, the Rilev, managed by Jardine Shipping Company, has also loaded 8,857.5 tons of foreign wheat from Australia and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Again, because the docks and floating docks are not available, the company has telegraphed the ship to anchor outside Wusong to wait until next Tuesday (the 20th) before it can enter the port. It can be seen that there is currently a shortage of floating docks in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Wharf is Extremely Crowded</p>
<p>As for the docks of the foreign Municipal Council, only small ferries and barges docked there before the war. Now, ships sailing to various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are all docking at this wharf. Therefore, the Council has specially set up a dock donation office outside Wuma Road on the Bund to manage dock affairs. Therefore, there has recently been a shortage of both floating docks and docks in the Huangpu River, and the shipping industry is greatly affected. The anti-aircraft gunners who shot down a Japanese plane in Zhenhai have made great contributions. Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government has commended them and awarded them a special reward of 10,000 national currency.</p>
<p>Progress in Negotiations with Portuguese Ships</p>
<p>Regarding the detention of more than ten Portuguese merchant ships, including the Tangbei, Tanglu, Tangqiao, Meda, Hailong, Fulu, and Shide, by the Japanese Navy, the former Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Alves, repeatedly protested and negotiated without result. Since Mr. Alves was transferred to New York, the case has been continued by the new Consul, Mr. Melo, who has continued to negotiate on the basis of reason. At the same time, the Japanese Navy has agreed to investigate whether the ships are indeed of Portuguese nationality, and the situation seems to have taken a new turn. According to reports from Daguang News reporters to the shipping industry, the Portuguese Consulate received a notice from the Japanese Navy yesterday stating that the commander of the Japanese Navy has now arrived in Shanghai and asked the Portuguese Consul to meet with him at 2:30 p.m. The Portuguese Consul complied and went to the meeting yesterday. However, the Consulate has not yet released the results. However, shipping merchants speculate that the case may be resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Safe Driving Week to Start Tomorrow; Radio Stations to Broadcast Special Programs; Cinemas to Show Safety Films</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Safe Driving Week is scheduled to begin tomorrow and last until the 24th. In addition to posting slogans on all types of vehicles in the city, the committee has also requested Chinese and foreign radio stations to broadcast special Safe Driving Week programs, featuring Shanghai storytellers and ballad singers. Cinemas will also show films specially produced by the committee. Yesterday, the committee specially posted picture flyers on various roads to attract the attention of citizens, including: (1) Caution can avoid danger, carelessness can easily cause accidents; (2) Do not walk in the middle of the road, use the sidewalk; (3) Only cross the road along the yellow safety line when the green light is on; (4) Do not rush across the road in front of a stopped streetcar or bus; (5) Do not cross the road between parked vehicles; (6) Do not call for rickshaws from across the road; (7) Be sure to look left and right before crossing the road.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Burn and Pillage Fishing Boats off the Coast of Zhenhai; Warship No. 1 Patrols the Waters of Hengshanbu; Puppet "Maintenance Association" Established in Daishan</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, on the afternoon of the 13th, two Japanese warships searched civilian ships off the coast of Zhenhai. One fishing boat was burned. On Daishan Island, a puppet "Maintenance Association" has been established by traitors since the Japanese troops landed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Japanese Warships Burn and Pillage Fishing Boats</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m. on the 12th, a Japanese warship sailed to the sea near Chuanshan, outside Zhenhai, near Lindashan, and anchored there. At around 2 p.m. on the 13th, another Japanese warship arrived. After the two warships met, they launched speedboats to search civilian ships in the nearby waters. One fishing boat was seized and then set on fire. At around 6 p.m., one warship weighed anchor and sailed away, while the other remained anchored in place. It was also learned that at 7:25 a.m. on the 13th, a gray Japanese warship with two funnels sailed to the Dongqi Shan waters in Xiangshan Port. At 7:40 a.m., it sailed to Hutou Bay to anchor. It launched a small speedboat to patrol back and forth, but there was no other movement. At 8:30 a.m., it sailed to the waters of Hengshanbu to anchor. At 8:50 a.m., it sailed to Dongqi Gate.</p>
<p>Puppet "Maintenance Association" Established in Daishan</p>
<p>Since the Japanese troops forcibly landed on Daishan Island in Dinghai on the 12th of last month, they have occupied the island and seized all the island's fishery and salt products. They also forced the use of puppet currency, causing great disturbance to the local area. According to a visitor from Dinghai to Shanghai, the Japanese troops organized a puppet "Public Security Maintenance Association" in Gaoting Town on the 12th. More than 30 local ruffians and hooligans attended the meeting, with Navy Garrison Commander Suishouyama Saburo as the chairman and traitor Hu as the translator. Huang Bohe was appointed as the head of the puppet association, and Zhou Peifu and Dai Atu were appointed as the deputy heads. The resolutions were as follows: (1) The "Maintenance Association" is responsible for local security; (2) The "Maintenance Association" may issue "permits," but they will not be issued on Zhoushan Island; (3) The whereabouts of all guerrillas and self-defense forces must be reported to the Japanese Commander, and violators will be severely punished; (4) All ships are only allowed to travel to Shanghai and Zha Pu; (5) The "Maintenance Association" is responsible for using puppet currency and collecting cash; (6) The "Maintenance Association" is responsible for reporting anti-Japanese elements and undertaking the supply of all necessities for the Japanese troops.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Disaster Area Rehabilitation and Public Bonds; Principal and Interest Repaid on Schedule; The Thirteenth Lottery Has Been Held; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to Pay Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Area Rehabilitation Public Bonds were issued in November 1932, with a total amount of 6 million national currency, underwritten by the British Anli Yangxing at 80% of the face value, for the purpose of repairing roads and bridges in the disaster area and carrying out other post-disaster reconstruction and relief work. It was designated to use the city's wharf donation income as the principal and interest repayment fund, and a fund management committee was organized to handle it. The interest rate was 7%, and the principal and interest were repaid twice a year on June 15th and December 15th. It was stipulated that all principal and interest would be paid off by December 15th, 1972. Xin Sheng News reporters learned from banking circles yesterday that the fund for these bonds, except for the wharves in the occupied area, is still collected and managed by the fund committee, so principal and interest are repaid as usual. The thirteenth lottery was held at 4 p.m. on the 14th of this month at the Shanghai Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. A total of one lottery was drawn, No. 33, with a principal amount of 60,000 national currency, together with the thirteenth interest coupon, which is allowed to be paid by the bank starting from the 15th of this month, with a six-year limit.</p>
<p>After the Release of the De Ping, from Ningbo to Shanghai</p>
<p>Will Still Go Directly to Ningbo Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The Italian merchant ship De Ping, of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, has been transporting goods between Shanghai and Ningbo after being approved by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters. It has traveled back and forth many times. However, on the morning of the 9th of this month, when the ship sailed to Ningbo, it was deemed to have violated orders because it failed to load grain, so it was detained by the Ningbo authorities. After explanation, it was understood and the detention was reduced to five days. The ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo at 8 a.m. on the 15th and entered the port at 7 p.m. that night. It is scheduled to go directly to Ningbo at 4 a.m. tomorrow morning. As for the traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo, it is still temporary. All ships must apply for approval before departure, and passengers are strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Condolences to the Bereaved Families of the Submarine; China Expresses Sympathy; Responds to the London Mayor's Fundraising for Pensions; Issues a Special Announcement to Encourage Recompense</h3>
<p>The British new submarine "Thetis" had an accident on the 2nd of this month during a diving test off the coast of Blegen. The ship was found on the day after the accident in the northeast of Carnarvonshire, North Wales, 40 miles outside Great Orme Head, Conwy Bay, after the efforts of the Navy. Except for Commander Urang and five others of the 5th Submarine Squadron who were rescued, a total of 97 officers and men were killed. People from all countries were deeply saddened by the news. The Chinese side, in order to express sympathy to the United Kingdom and to comfort the families of the martyred officers, in response to the London Mayor's fundraising for pensions to comfort the bereaved families, issued a special announcement to people from all walks of life, encouraging them to donate generously to the cause. The "Thetis" joined the Navy on March 4 at Portland, with a total crew of 53 officers and men, a length of 265 feet, a tonnage of 1,000 to 1,500 tons, a 4-inch gun, six torpedo tubes, a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour, and a construction cost of 350,000 pounds.</p>
<h3>Huang Liang and Gong Boyu Martyred in Hengjing</h3>
<p>Reported for Pension; Remains Buried</p>
<p>Huang Liang, the Suzhou District Captain of the Military Commission's 京沪行动队 Jinghu Action Team, and Gong Boyu, a member of the 小组组員, were unfortunately learned of by Wu Jiazhen, Shi Zhaokui and others, special agents of the puppet "2nd Pacification District," on the 6th of this month in Hengjing Town, Suzhou, and were surrounded and searched. Huang and Gong immediately fought back, but after running out of ammunition, they were valiantly martyred under a hail of bullets. The person in charge stationed in Shanghai has telegraphed the headquarters to request preferential pensions and allocated 600 yuan for the funeral expenses of the two martyrs. The remains of the two martyrs have been buried on the shores of Taihu Lake. The green waters and green mountains will ensure that the loyal souls who sacrificed for the national cause will live on forever.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Car Crash Case Verdict; Li Li's Rashness Caused Death; The Japanese Sentry's Rash Actions Were Also a Cause of Li Li's Death; Wimsett Attended Court with a Cane to Testify</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that Li Li, the headmaster of the Lester School, crashed his car with a Japanese bus near Broadway Road and Minhang Road on the night of April 24. Li Li and a Japanese sentry died from serious injuries. Li Li's wife and Mr. Wimsett, a Western police officer from the police station, who were in the same car, have recovered from their injuries. The case was continued yesterday (the 15th) by British Coroner Haynes. Mr. Wimsett, a witness, testified in court with a cane, stating that at around 8:35 p.m. on April 24, he was on duty at the south end of the Garden Bridge, when a foreign man and woman (now known to be Li Li and his wife) stopped their car in front of him and said that they had hit an obstacle on the north bank of the bridge. The witness got into the car and drove back with them. When they arrived at Broadway Bridge, Li Li's wife recognized that they had collided with an obstacle on the bridge, so they stopped the car and talked to the Japanese sentry at the bridgehead. The Japanese soldier did not understand English. After a while, Li Li agreed to drive to the Hongkou police station and drove slowly to the top of the bridge to indicate to the Japanese</p>
<p>sentry that he was driving to the Hongkou police station. When the car drove off the bridge, it was driving quite fast. Suddenly, two Japanese sentries jumped onto the left and right running boards next to the driver's seat. The sentry on the right grabbed the steering wheel with both hands, and the sentry on the left also leaned into the car window towards the steering wheel. Li Li's left hand left the wheel and pushed him away. The sentry then stood straight on the running board. At that time, Li Li put the speedometer in second gear, and the sentry on the right turned the steering wheel left and right, causing the car to travel in a curved line along Broadway Road. Li Li</p>
<p>tried to correct it. When the car was near the corner of Zha Pu Road, the front and rear wheels on the left side drove onto the sidewalk on the left side and then reversed into Broadway Road. Suddenly, the witness felt a jolt and leaned forward, hitting the back of Li Li's seat with his nose, and lost consciousness. When he woke up, he was in the hospital. At that time, the car was traveling at 15 miles per hour. Li Li was conscious, but did not try to stop the car. At this point, the coroner adjourned the court. According to the English-language "North China Daily News," British Coroner Haynes opened the inquiry into the Li Li case this morning (the 16th).</p>
<p>After reviewing the testimony, the verdict was that Li Li died due to his reckless actions. The reckless actions of the Japanese sentry turning the steering wheel, when he should have stopped the car, were also a cause of Li Li's death. Mr. Haynes also stated that he had asked the Japanese Marines to send someone to testify in court, but unfortunately no one attended. As for the driver of the bus that collided with Li Li's car, he was not at fault.</p>
<p>A Young Woman Who Loves Fashion Swallows Opium</p>
<p>Rebuked by Her Parents</p>

<h3>The Japanese Side Claims to Have Captured the Leader of an Arson Group</h3>
<p>The news agency Shen Wen She reports that the Japanese side announced yesterday that the fires in Hongkou have been identified as the work of an anti-Japanese arson group. As a result of the investigation by the Japanese military police, they have obtained all the information about the group and captured its members, including Wang Genbao and Mao Huzi. On May 27, they captured the mastermind of the group, Yu Yilan, who is 30 years old. He infiltrated Hongkou in early May and recruited workers from various factories as members of his group. On May 9, Yu ordered the members to set fires in various locations, including: Warehouse No. 2 of Shanghai Textile Factory No. 4 at No. 585 Lane, Shenxin Textile Factory on Henan Road, Warehouse No. 37Y of Gonghexian Wharf, Gongqin Iron Factory on Linqing Road, Kangtai Weaving Factory on Huade Road, Meihua Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 640 Hejian Road, and Hengfeng Textile Factory on Huasheng Road. All of these fires were orchestrated by Yu.</p>
<h3>Colluding with Friends to Set a Trap, Falsely Accusing Wife of Adultery, Original Sentence Revoked After Investigation, Pang Qingbao Cannot Escape the Law</h3>
<p>Pang Qingbao, a native of Nanjing and owner of the Xiao Leyi Restaurant at 490 Zhejiang Road, previously married Cao Fuzhen, a woman from Liuhe, and they had children. However, in recent years, the relationship between the couple had deteriorated significantly, with frequent disputes and complications arising. Cao had previously filed a complaint with the Liuhe County government accusing Pang Qingbao of abandonment, while Pang accused his wife of adultery with a shop employee named Hu. Last year, Pang, at the instigation of his friend Lu Zhicheng, became acquainted with a woman and cohabited with her at a certain address in Dexingfang, Gansu Road. Cao learned of this and, together with her aunt,</p>
<p>went to catch them in the act. However, Pang quickly escaped, and they did not find him, but only saw Lu Zhicheng inside the room. At the time, Cao, angered by Lu's instigation of her husband, slapped him twice. Then, on November 19 of last year, Pang Qingbao suddenly reported to the Old Zha Gate police station, claiming that his wife Cao and Lu Zhicheng were having an affair and were currently secluded in room 320 of the Far East Hotel, requesting their arrest. The police sent detectives to the hotel, where they indeed found Cao and Lu in the room, and</p>
<p>there was still evidence of inappropriate behavior on the bed. The evidence was conclusive, and they were jointly sued in the Special District Court No. 1. Cao testified in court that she had gone to the Far East Hotel at her husband's invitation to take a bath, not expecting that he was setting a trap for her, the real reason being Pang's extramarital affair. Lu Zhicheng not only did not deny the accusation but directly confessed, showing no shame. The judge sentenced Pang, Cao, and Lu Zhicheng to three months of imprisonment each, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. Upon hearing the verdict, Lu immediately stated that he would waive his right to appeal, while Cao, believing that the entire matter</p>
<p>was a conspiracy between her husband and Lu Zhicheng to intentionally frame her, refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court Second Branch. After a detailed examination by the High Court and an on-site inspection of the Far East Hotel, it was determined that there was various evidence that indicated suspicions, clearly a deliberately arranged setup. The original verdict was overturned, and Pang and Cao were declared innocent. The Procuratorate of the Special District Court No. 1 also took this case very seriously, fearing the consequences if such behavior were to become widespread. Therefore, Prosecutor Song Gunshan initiated an investigation into the false accusation by Pang Qingbao and Lu Zhicheng.</p>
<p>Because Lu's whereabouts were unknown, the summons could not be served, and the proceedings were temporarily suspended. As for Pang Qingbao, it was deemed that there was indeed suspicion of false accusation, and he was ordered to find a guarantor to be released. A public prosecution for false accusation was filed with the criminal court of the same level. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the second criminal court to conduct the hearing. The Shanghai Municipal Council also sent lawyer Jiang Baolian to attend the hearing. After Prosecutor Song stated the reasons for the prosecution, Pang Qingbao insisted that his wife's adultery was a fact. Under questioning by Judge Xiao, the case was adjourned for further verification.</p>
<p>French Concession Health Bureau Report: Typhoid Fever Outbreak</p>

Regarding the supply of food in the market, it was reported that there was a plentiful supply of fish, vegetables, and eggs in May, but a shortage of chicken and duck, probably due to the season. The supply of pork was irregular, varying in quantity, which was related to the source. Therefore, its price also fluctuated from time to time.</p>

<p>Chen Wang, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, Lyuban Road, Xiafei Road, previously engaged lawyer Hu Yongsheng to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special District Court No. 2, accusing Qi Linsheng, a medical doctor from Shangcheng, Henan, of abducting her 19-year-old daughter, Chen Sanyuan, on October 7 of last year, persuading her to leave home and concealing her at No. 522 Beile Road for illicit relations until April 12 of this year, when she was finally found on the street and brought home. She requested that Qi be prosecuted for disrupting family morality and also filed a civil suit seeking compensation and alimony of 3,000 yuan. Qi also engaged a lawyer to defend himself and</p>
<p>filed a countersuit for false accusation. After several court hearings presided over by Judge Liao Yuan, the defendant vehemently denied the accusations, claiming they were based on grudges and fabricated. The court ordered an adjournment to summon witnesses for further questioning. This case was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court held another hearing to continue the trial. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the witness Wang Shuiquan testified that he was 30 years old, from Beijing, and lived in the pavilion room upstairs at No. 522 Beile Road, Shunchang Coal Store. He worked as a performer at the Grand Stage and did not know the plaintiff. He knew the defendant because his wife had been ill before, and he had asked him to see her, owing him some medical expenses. In October of last year, the defendant came to him to rent a room, saying it was for his concubine, who had no place to live,</p>
<p>staying there for a few days, with a bed opposite, paying ten yuan per month for rent and food. The defendant himself often came and went. Qi Linsheng stated that the witness Wang Shuiquan was the plaintiff Chen Wang's younger brother, so of course, he would help her speak, completely fabricating and making things up. He asked the court to investigate thoroughly and stated that if he had indeed committed any illegal acts, he would be willing to behead himself and confess. The defendant's defense lawyer requested that Zhang Shucheng, who had originally introduced the defendant to the plaintiff to prescribe medicine for smoking cessation, be summoned to court for questioning. The court approved this request and adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 26th for further questioning of witnesses.</p>

According to the plaintiff, she married the defendant in April 1935 and had a son and a daughter. Initially, their relationship was good, but later, due to the defendant's extramarital affair, he treated her as an enemy.

Not long after returning home, the old habits resurfaced, and he often beat her. On April 3 of this year, she was beaten severely again.

<p>Wang Youhong, a Cantonese man aged 24, worked as an employee at Hesheng Yarn Company, No. 59 Ningbo Road. On September 20 of last year, he was instructed by manager Tang Qifu to deliver a Huaqiao Bank immediate payment check for 7,290 yuan to Dasheng Yarn Company on Nanjing Road.

He asked the plaintiff to return home and expressed his remorse to the plaintiff, asking her to forgive him once more. If he beats her again in the future, it will be considered a condition for divorce, allowing her to divorce him and bear the losses. The plaintiff also stated that she had been beaten hundreds of times since marrying the defendant.

<h3>International Exchange Center Unchanged, Shanghai Still Holds Financial Hub, Industry, Commerce and Real Estate Are Quite Active, Inland Funds Return to Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Preparation Committee's business report for 1938, as summarized by the Xinsheng News reporter, is as follows: This year, the war spread, and Shanghai's environment was more difficult than ever before. Shanghai, which has always been the national financial hub, has seen its position and situation change. The reasons why it has still been able to maintain its traditional importance are: First, international exchange is still centered in Shanghai, and transactions are still flourishing. Second, the authorities of the two special districts have spared no effort to maintain the city's safety and welfare. Small-scale industry, commerce, and real estate within the concessions are quite active. Third, refugees from all over the country have flocked here, increasing the population within the concessions. Funds that flowed into the interior in previous years have now concentrated in Shanghai again, and bank deposits have all increased.</p>
<p>(A) Joint Preparation Department</p>
<p>Committee Banks: Hengli Bank temporarily suspended business on August 9 of last year and withdrew from the association. On October 4 of this year, the bank reorganized and resumed business in accordance with the law, and rejoined the association on the same day. On November 21, Tonghe Bank announced its closure and withdrew from the association. This year, the number of committee banks remains at 33. Due to the current situation, the regular meeting of the representatives of the committee banks has not yet been convened after the last settlement.</p>
<p>Prepared Assets: According to the total amount of prepared assets deposited by the banks at the end of this year, the amount is 57,715,043.56 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 1,932,560.16 yuan compared with the end of 1937. The total amount of all preparations was 62.01% of the total assessed value in the previous settlement and 62.44% of the total assessed value in the next settlement. According to the number of the next settlement, the classification of assets is as follows: real estate accounts for 86.50% of the total amount, foreign securities account for 6.51%, and domestic government bonds account for 6.99%.</p>
<p>Document Lending: According to the total number of documents received by the banks at the end of the year, the amount is 36,014,800 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 464,400 yuan compared with the end of 1937. In the upper half of this year's settlement, the total amount of public loan lending was 299,708,000 yuan in national currency, which is an increase of more than 234.6 million yuan compared with the upper half of 1937. In the lower half of the settlement, the total amount of public loan lending was 386,091,000 yuan in national currency, which is an increase of more than 142.6 million yuan compared with the lower half of 1937. The above-mentioned total lending amount is the cumulative number of each day. This year, due to a small number of colleagues continuing to borrow, the total amount is much larger than last year. The interest rate for public loan funds averaged three cents in national currency for the first half of the year, and two cents for exchange transfers. The average interest rate for the second half of the year was 2.58 cents in national currency, and two cents for exchange transfers.</p>
<p>Acceptance Discount: This year, the total discount on accepted drafts by the association was 9,850,000 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 860,000 yuan compared with 1937. The discounted bills that have not yet expired by the end of the year total 2 million yuan in national currency. The association's acceptance draft discount rate, based on 90-day drafts as a standard, had an annual average rate of 2.78 cents in national currency and two cents for exchange transfers.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending: Starting on August 17 of last year, the association handled interbank exchange transfers. At that time, the Shanghai war had just begun, and the industry needed a large amount of funds to prepare for withdrawals. Therefore, the amount of lending gradually increased, reaching more than 8.34 million yuan at most. This year, due to the increase in deposits in various banks, the industry's capital was more abundant than before. The association's lending amount has gradually decreased. At the end of June, the association's lending balance was 4,513,608 yuan in national currency. At the end of the year, the lending balance was 3,740,800 yuan. The average lending rate for the whole year was 2.2 cents. The association's interbank exchange transfers were originally complementary to the clearing and exchange transfers handled by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications Four Bank Lending Committee. This year, in order to concentrate on dealing with the situation, all lending applications from various banks were largely entrusted by the association to handle on behalf of the committee. The amount of lending and collateral was still jointly approved by the four banks. As of the end of the year, the total amount of loans made by the association on behalf of the four banks was 1,620,000 yuan in national currency, including 600,000 yuan for clearing loans and 1,020,000 yuan for exchange transfer loans.</p>
<p>Exchange Transfer Discount: Since the fact that exchange transfer discounts and cash-outs occurred in the market, the initial discount per thousand yuan was only six or seven yuan. Since the government announced foreign exchange control in March, the discount gradually rose to thirty or forty yuan. At the same time, the general demand for legal currency increased, and the amount of legal currency in circulation in the market became increasingly scarce. In April, the association was entrusted by the Central Bank to try to adjust the situation as appropriate, but for a time, there was still a shortage of supply. On May 7, the discount per thousand yuan rose to as high as seventy-nine yuan. At that time, the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications entrusted the association to maintain the market as much as possible. The market discount was stabilized at around fifty yuan. The process is as described above. In November, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, and people were uneasy, causing the discount to rise to over sixty yuan again. It soon returned to around forty-five yuan, and by the end of the year, it had fallen to thirty-eight or thirty-nine yuan, and the market had stabilized. The association's exchange transfer bill discount rate was determined by the association after reviewing the market at any time in consultation with the three banks.</p>
<p>Interbank Deposits: Banks, trust companies, and money houses other than exchange banks opened accounts with the association for the convenience of clearing bills, either due to loan transfers or for the convenience of clearing bills. This type of deposit is listed in the interbank deposit item in the association's balance sheet. The total deposit balance at the end of the year was 7,523,297.36 yuan, of which clearing deposits accounted for 35.19% and exchange transfer deposits accounted for 64.81%.</p>
<p>(B) Bill Exchange Department</p>
<p>Exchange Banks: Due to environmental reasons, Shanghai City Bank temporarily suspended business on February 5 of this year. The association stopped its bill exchange from the same day. After Guangdong Bank reorganized and resumed business last year, the association originally acted as its exchange agent. On March 1 of this year, it joined as an exchange bank. On July 4, the Coal Industry Bank and Zhengming Bank simultaneously entrusted the association to act as their exchange agent. On October 4, Hengli Bank reorganized and resumed business, and entrusted the association to act as its exchange agent on the same day. On November 21, Tonghe Bank announced its closure and withdrew from the exchange. In addition, some branches of various banks in the city were still closed or merged this year. As of the end of the year, the number of exchange banks in the association remained at 36. The number of banks entrusting the association to act as their exchange agent was 10, an increase of one compared with last year. The number of branches of various banks in the city participating in the exchange was 77, a decrease of 11 compared with last year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Fares on the Vietnam National Railway</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>The Vietnam National Railway is divided into three sections. The line from Hanoi to Saigon is the trunk line, and the line from Hanoi to Nacham is the branch line. From Hanoi, one can transfer to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to reach Kunming directly. There is also the line from Bainangben (Jin Tower City) to Magubalai, which is not connected to the above two lines, but is also an important transportation route in southern Vietnam. In today's situation where domestic transportation urgently needs to connect with foreign countries, the Vietnam National Railway does indeed occupy an important position. We have obtained the prices of passenger tickets, sleeper berths, and meals, which are detailed below for the reference of readers:</p>

The sleeper berth fees are as follows: From Hanoi to Yian and Shunhua (same price), first class 6 Vietnamese dollars, second class 4 Vietnamese dollars; to Chalin, first class 7 Vietnamese dollars, second class 4.75 Vietnamese dollars; to Kuofeng and Natolan (same price), first class 10 Vietnamese dollars, second class 7 Vietnamese dollars.

<h3>Transportation Briefs</h3>
<p>Jawa Company Now Collects Foreign Currency The Jawa Company's postal ships operating between Shanghai and Xiamen originally calculated fares in national currency. Due to the soaring foreign exchange rates, the company has suffered considerable losses. Therefore, starting with the Zhishaluya on the 21st of this month, departing from Shanghai to Xiamen and Hong Kong, all passenger tickets to Xiamen and Hong Kong will be collected in foreign currency. The fares are as follows:</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Xiamen: First class 5 British pounds, second class 2 pounds and 5 shillings, third class 1 pound and 15 shillings, fourth class 1 pound.</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Hong Kong: First class 7 British pounds, second class 3 pounds and 5 shillings, third class 2 pounds, fourth class 1 pound and 5 shillings.</p>
<p>Italian Postal Ships Stop Selling Round-Trip Tickets The Italian Postal Ship Company has stopped selling all two-month round-trip tickets from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Xiaoluzong, and from Hong Kong to Xiaoluzong, starting from May 25th. Therefore, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong can no longer enjoy the company's two-month round-trip ticket优惠。(The return ticket price for the originally scheduled two-month round-trip ticket was only one-third or half of the one-way ticket price.) Six-month round-trip tickets can still be sold, but the return ticket price is only 80% of the one-way ticket price.</p>
<p>Taigu Yihui Increases Prices Due to the recent increase in foreign exchange rates, the above company will also implement price increases from the 21st of this month. The increase rate will be about 10% of the originally scheduled ticket price. The newly set ticket prices are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Hong Kong: Official cabin 60 yuan in national currency, room cabin 42 yuan, bunk 31 yuan, general cabin 24 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai to Haiphong: Official cabin 112 yuan in national currency, room cabin 82 yuan, bunk 54 yuan, general cabin 44 yuan (including head tax).</p>
<p>Shanghai to Tianjin: Official cabin 65 yuan in national currency, room cabin 50 yuan, bunk 40 yuan, general cabin 26 yuan.</p>
<p>Detailed ticket prices can be inquired from the company and various travel agencies. Passengers who book and pay a deposit before the 21st can enjoy the originally scheduled ticket prices.</p>
<p>French Airlines Increase Prices The Hong Kong-Hanoi section of the company's air ticket prices has been changed from June 1st of this year to 14 British pounds for a one-way ticket from Hong Kong to Hanoi, 25 pounds for a round trip, and 1 shilling and 5 pence per kilogram of excess baggage. The one-way ticket from Hanoi to Hong Kong is 2,500 French francs, the round trip ticket is 4,500 French francs, and the excess baggage is charged at 12.5 French francs per kilogram. The ticket prices for other stations in the Far East of the company will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Williams Overland New Cars Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fulin Automobile Company at 36 West Road has recently transported a batch of 1939 Williams Overland cars. The engine is powerful and can accelerate from 10 miles per hour to 50 miles per hour in 15 seconds, or from zero miles per hour to 60 miles per hour in 18 seconds. The car stops quickly and can stop from 45 miles per hour within a distance of six car lengths. With six seats and four cylinders, the car is exceptionally spacious and extremely economical in terms of gasoline consumption. It is truly a rare car in the low-price range. The company is currently assembling the new cars and will be able to display them soon.</p>
<h3>Journey to Guangxi (Continued from Last Issue)</h3>
<p>— Kechang</p>
<p>After obtaining the passport, pay a visa fee of one yuan at the French Consulate on the top floor of Alexandra House on Des Voeux Road and apply for an endorsement. Once endorsed, it becomes effective. This type of passport can only stay in Haiphong for fourteen days. If you need to stay longer, a local reputable business must apply for an extension from the police station on your behalf. Otherwise, you will be severely punished. Upon arriving in Haiphong, first take a train to Hanoi, a distance of 102 kilometers, which can be reached in two hours. The ticket price is 2.13 Vietnamese dollars for second class and 1.25 Vietnamese dollars for third class. From Hanoi, transfer to the northern section of the Vietnam National Railway to the Vietnamese border town of Dongdeng, a distance of 167 kilometers, which can be reached in 50 hours. The ticket price is 9.78 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 6.52 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 2.70 Vietnamese dollars for third class, and 1.13 Vietnamese dollars for fourth class, all in Vietnamese currency. In the eyes of ordinary people, to go to Longzhou, one should naturally get off at Dongdeng. However, Liangshan has better hotels and restaurants for accommodation. Dongdeng is just a border town, and accommodation is not easy to find at all. Secondly, the Longliang bus starts from Liangshan, and changing to a bus in Liangshan is also more convenient than in Dongdeng. Therefore, it is still more convenient to get off in Liangshan first. The ticket price from Hanoi to Liangshan is 8.88 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 5.92 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 2.44 Vietnamese dollars for third class, and 1.02 Vietnamese dollars for fourth class, all in Vietnamese currency. From Liangshan to Longzhou in Guangxi, it is 73 kilometers, passing through Dongdeng, Zhennanguan, Aikou, Pingxiang, Nakan, and Yazitan. The bus leaves Liangshan at 2:00 PM (Vietnam time), which is one hour behind domestic time, and arrives in Longzhou at 7:00 PM (domestic time). The ticket price is 6.64 Guangxi currency (every 2 Guangxi currency equals 1 national currency). Free baggage is limited to 20 kilograms per person, and overweight baggage is charged 0.788 Guangxi currency per 10 kilograms. Upon arriving in Longzhou, you can take the Guangxi Highway Bureau's long-distance bus to Nanning. From Nanning, the highway can lead to Guilin via Liuzhou, or to Guiyang via Datang. The Guangxi Provincial Highway Bureau's buses depart from Longzhou and Nanning every day, one from Longzhou at 5:00 AM, and arrives in Nanning around 4:00 PM. The ticket price is 11.21 national currency per person. Free baggage is also limited to 20 kilograms, and overweight baggage is charged 1 yuan in national currency per 10 kilograms. In addition, there is also a direct highway from Haiphong to Longzhou, which can be reached by hiring a small chartered car. The entire journey from Haiphong to Longzhou can be completed in six or seven hours by a small chartered car. If you depart from Haiphong at 8:00 AM, rest for lunch in Liangshan, and depart from Liangshan again at 2:00 PM, you can arrive in Longzhou by 5:00 PM. However, a small chartered car costs about 90 Vietnamese dollars.</p>
<p>According to what has been said above, going to Guangxi now cannot be considered inconvenient, but there are a few things to pay attention to: When entering Haiphong, the passport should be sent to the French Police Department for endorsement and the route of departure must be declared, as the route must match when leaving the country. If the route changes, the police station must re-endorse it. Items such as silk, satin, wool, cloth, clothing, embroidery, cosmetics, and all other newly purchased items that are likely to be taxed may be removed as much as possible, grouped together, and pointed out to customs officers upon arrival to await their determination of whether to tax them. In this way, you can avoid penalties and hope that the inspection of the remaining luggage will be simplified. Do not secretly wrap them in bedding or other places, hoping to smuggle them through, because once they are discovered, not only will the luggage be detained, but also severely punished. When buying a long-distance bus ticket in Liangshan, be sure to show your passport to the station staff for inspection, otherwise you will need a certificate from the head of the village. When the bus arrives in Dongdeng, get off the bus to complete the exit procedures for passport endorsement. Crossing Zhennanguan is Guangxi Province. The Zhennanguan Branch of the Guangxi Anti-Smuggling Bureau will check passports. After another four kilometers to Aikou Town, the Longzhou Customs Branch will check luggage. Upon arriving in Longzhou, you must also go to the Anti-Smuggling Bureau to endorse the passport before entering the city. These procedures must be noted and not forgotten. (End)</p>
<h3>Travel Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Mr. Weng Yuxiang asks about the situation of going to Fujian:</p>
<p>Answer: There were originally ships from the Yihui Company and other Portuguese merchants sailing from Shanghai to Fuzhou, with ticket prices of 30 yuan for official cabins, 20 yuan for room cabins, and 11 yuan for general cabins. Recently, the ships of various companies have all been suspended. Occasionally, there are ships sailing, but there are very few scheduled trips. Therefore, those going to Fujian may take the route through Wenzhou, passing through Qingtian, Lishui, and Longquan, and entering Fujian Province at Pucheng, then taking the Fujian Provincial Highway to Fuzhou. However, anyone going to Wenzhou must hold a local shop guarantee. Letters to Fujian are also transferred through Zhejiang Province, which can take more than ten days to reach.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Luo asks about going to Dageng County, Jiangxi</p>
<p>Route:</p>
<p>Answer: If you want to take the route to Shantou to Dageng, Jiangxi, you can refer to the eleventh issue of this magazine. After arriving in Qujiang, you can follow the highway to Dageng, and the bus fare is more than ten yuan. It is inconvenient to carry maps when traveling in the interior. As for a small number of textbooks, there is no problem. Smallpox vaccination, immunization, and identification are all required. The identification should be issued by the agency or school where the person works or studies to be valid.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zhendong asks about flights between Hong Kong and Kunming</p>
<p>and ships between Hong Kong and Fangcheng.。</p>
<p>Answer: There are no direct flights between Hong Kong and Kunming. First, take a French or Imperial Airways flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi, Vietnam. The ticket price is 14 British pounds. From Hanoi, transfer to a Eurasia or China National Aviation Corporation flight to Yunnan. The ticket price is 95 Vietnamese dollars and 90 yuan. Free baggage is only 5 kilograms and is subject to inspection. Those who take the route through Vietnam to Yunnan must have a passport before they are allowed to purchase a ticket. To go from Hong Kong to Fangcheng, you can take the French Far East Shipping Company's Xiaoguangdong ship, which departs from Hong Kong on the 10th, 20th, and 30th of each month. The third-class ticket price is 33 Vietnamese dollars, and the fourth-class ticket price is 12 Hong Kong dollars. It takes two days to reach. When arriving in Fangcheng, there is no need to pay tax on the newly made Chinese clothing and children's clothing you bring.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Travel Business (Continued) (End)  Zhou Sizhong</h3>
<p>The United States: The travel business is extremely developed in the United States. This is because the country is prosperous, and the people lead stable lives, so they are very interested in travel. The money spent by Americans traveling to various countries each year is actually greater than the amount spent by people from other countries traveling to America. In the United States, the travel business is a form of trade surplus for the country, but globally, it is indeed the only country that regulates the world economy. One of its travel agencies is American Express Co., which is also a private company, and its organization and business are roughly similar to those of Thomas Cook in the United Kingdom. Another is the National Park Service, which is funded and operated by the railway sector. Every urban business association has an Information Bureau established specifically to facilitate foreign tourists and solicit this kind of intangible export business.</p>
<p>France: France attaches great importance to the travel business and spends a huge sum of 1.2 million US dollars annually specifically for overseas promotion expenses. Recently, a Secretary of State has been added within the government to specifically handle this matter, in order to promote and develop it. According to official French statistics, in 1937, there were 90 million tourists from various countries visiting France, and the money they spent in France reached 6 billion francs. The power of its publicity is imaginable. As for its travel agencies: one is the Tourism Bureau, which is operated with funds from the government and the Ministry of Transportation; the other is the Travel Alliance, which is organized by local agencies and specializes in research on the travel business.</p>
<p>Germany: Germany's travel agency is funded and operated by the government, railway banks, shipping companies, and others. Its business includes selling train and boat tickets, transporting luggage, and exchanging foreign currency. It sends 2.5 million copies of printed materials to foreign countries each year, which shows that it spares no effort in promoting the travel business. In addition, those who travel to Germany are exempt from passport visa fees, minor landing taxes, and other special taxes, so the total number of tourists to Germany each year can exceed 1.3 million. The 1936 World Olympic Games were held in Berlin, and tourists from various countries reached more than 1.62 million; however, the total number of tourists to Germany in the following year (1937) increased to 1.89 million, which was not less than the number of people during the World Olympic Games. This shows that the development of the travel business in Germany is truly amazing.</p>
<p>Switzerland: Since Switzerland does not produce much and its industrial and commercial enterprises are not as large as those of major countries, what does its government rely on for funding? The travel business has therefore become extremely important to the government. Switzerland is the most beautiful country in Europe, and the number of people from various countries visiting Switzerland is increasing every year. The Swiss government's funding largely depends on this, so it strives to provide convenience for foreign tourists. All travelers to Switzerland are given special convenience, such as not requiring passport visas and offering special prices for railways. All preferential measures that can facilitate travelers are implemented to the best of its ability. The travel agency is the National Tourism Bureau, which is funded and operated by the government and various cities. It strives exceptionally hard to attract foreign guests. According to non-official reports, the number of tourists to Switzerland can reach 3.5 million per year.</p>
<p>Other countries, such as Canada, the Soviet Union, Italy, Sweden, Turkey, Poland, Greece, the Netherlands, Mexico, and New Zealand, all have travel agencies established, and their purpose of promoting travel is also the same, except that their scale is different.</p>
<p>China's Travel Business is Still Undeveloped In contrast, in our country, neither the government nor the people pay much attention to the travel business, and they cannot find ways to attract foreign tourists. The government authorities do not attach importance to this industry or provide much assistance. In addition, national construction has been awaiting progress in recent years, so assistance and promotion of the travel business is beyond its capabilities. According to a reliable survey in 1931, the total amount spent by American tourists in various countries was more than 50.275 million yuan, while China only received more than 6 million yuan, which is the smallest amount among all countries. This proves that it cannot pay attention to overseas publicity work. Otherwise, with our country's beautiful mountains and rivers, abundant products, and gradual progress in industry and commerce, what could attract foreign tourists would be more than this number.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Travel Business However, Shanghai is the most prosperous commercial port in China, and it also has concessions, so its situation is different from other parts of the country, and its travel business is also more developed than other places. However, the establishment of travel agencies in Shanghai was not only not initiated by the Chinese government, but also not operated by Chinese nationals. Although the author has worked in travel agencies for more than seven years, I have always felt regretful when I think of this. Currently, the travel business in Shanghai has developed to a considerable extent, and before the war, this business had an extremely prosperous trend. Although there are many travel agencies, only a few are well-organized and known to both Chinese and foreigners. The more famous ones are Thomas Cook &amp; Son, American Express Company, Japan Tourist Bureau, and China Travel Service, the only Chinese travel agency where the author currently works. The following is a description of the business situation of each of the above companies in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Travel Agencies Thomas Cook &amp; Son is the originator of the travel industry. Its invention was as early as 97 years ago, as I have mentioned in the first chapter. It has a total of more than 360 branches worldwide. It came to the Far East around 1913, and the Shanghai office is the headquarters of its Far East branch. It was also one of the earliest companies to come to Shanghai. It is currently located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. Its business purpose is mainly to sell train, boat, and plane tickets; it also acts as an agent for international passenger car berths, transports luggage, and handles transportation matters. It also issues travel checks in gold pounds and US dollars and operates foreign exchange. Before the establishment of China Travel Service, it was the most perfect travel agency in Shanghai. Recently, its business has been greatly affected by the war.</p>
<p>Japan Tourist Bureau This agency was originally a commercial enterprise. Later, the Japanese government, recognizing the importance of the travel business and its benefits to the national economy, invested in and assisted in transforming it into a travel agency jointly run by the government and private sector. It has a history of 26 years and is dedicated to promoting international understanding and goodwill and attracting foreign tourists to Japan as its sole mission. Almost every country has a branch of this bureau. In major cities and commercial ports in China, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beijing, Shenyang, etc., there are branch offices. The Japan Tourist Bureau in Shanghai has been established for 15 years. Its business policy is mainly to promote Japanese scenic spots and attract tourists to Japan. Before the war, the number of tourist groups to Japan attracted by the bureau each year was extremely large, and its income was very abundant. Since the outbreak of the war, its business has felt very desolate.</p>
<p>American Express Co. This is an American travel agency. Its headquarters is on Broadway in New York, and it has branches in many countries. The Far East headquarters is in Hong Kong, and it has a 20-year history in Shanghai. Its business situation also contains banking characteristics, so it is divided into two departments: the banking department and the travel department. The banking department specializes in foreign exchange and travel checks; the travel department mainly undertakes tours. Most of the company's tourists are Americans. It also used to sell train and plane tickets and transport luggage. After the war, the number of tourists decreased, and it only uses boat tickets as its main business. Its business has been greatly affected.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also World Travel Service Travel Advisers, which are travel agencies run by Westerners. They also have a considerable history in Shanghai, but their business is not very developed. Also, at the beginning of the war, International Guide Burean emerged in response to the situation, and its business was naturally very developed, but it was ultimately a speculative business and its foundation was not solid, so it was only a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>China Travel Service China Travel Service is a travel agency run by Chinese people. It was established in 1923, and 16 years have passed since then. Examining its history, it is not very long, but describing the course of its business and the motives for its establishment, there is something to be said: Since the European War, the travel business in Europe and the United States has made rapid progress, and the development situation has been discussed earlier. The travel agencies of foreigners in China have also become increasingly developed. Chinese people who travel abroad also gradually rely on foreigners for boats, vehicles, and luggage. People with lofty ideals are worried about this. The founder of this agency was Mr. Chen Guangfu. However, some people may not know what Mr. Chen's motives were for founding a travel agency. Before reporting on the organization of the travel agency itself, I would like to start with this matter, which I think readers will also be happy to hear. Mr. Chen Guangfu is a travel enthusiast. Thirty years ago, he personally visited various places in China and abroad, and his knowledge was broad, and he benefited greatly from travel. However, at that time, there was no travel agency established in China. If he wanted to travel abroad, he had to consult a travel agency run by foreigners. I often think that those who can create great undertakings must have greater intelligence than ordinary people, but the motives for their great undertakings may be in extremely small places, and they can stimulate their great intelligence to create great undertakings. Observing Mr. Chen's founding of a travel agency, I believe even more that Mr. Chen's founding of a travel agency was not based on empty assumptions, nor was it a fleeting idea. The story is as follows: One day, Mr. Chen wanted to travel again, so he went to a Western company to discuss the itinerary. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Chen expressed his intentions to the Western staff member of the company, the staff member talked intimately with a Western woman and did not entertain the customer, as if it was not important. Mr. Chen did not use his anger at this. After returning, countless thoughts gathered in his mind: "Why should there be a travel agency run by foreigners in China's own territory? Why can't Chinese people solve their own travel problems? I am Chinese and want to travel around my own land, so why should foreigners guide me? When foreigners come to China, why don't Chinese people have travel agencies to guide and entertain them? Are Chinese people unable to run travel agencies?" And so on. These questions repeatedly asked himself, and all these kinds of things swirled in his mind and did not immediately dissipate. After Mr. Chen thought again and again, he made the greatest determination and created this only China Travel Service run by Chinese people. After the agency was established, it adhered to Mr. Chen's principle of serving society and engaged in travel matters. At that time, when the Chinese people saw this emerging industry, they all expressed their joy. Those who had contact with foreigners all returned to this agency. Over time, its reputation was established, and even foreign travelers sought only this agency. After more than ten years of hard work by colleagues, it has the foundation it has today. Before the war, all important commercial ports and cities in China had staff serving the agency, because they could contact each other, and travelers felt that it was convenient. Since the outbreak of the war, although the ports that have fallen into war zones have withdrawn one after another, the emerging businesses in the southwest and northwest have increased even more, and everything that can benefit the travel community and the country is done to the best of its ability. As for Shanghai, there is a branch on Sichuan Road; however, fearing that the service is not comprehensive, five branch offices have been established on Yuyuan Road, Baxianqiao, Tongfu Road, Xiafei Road, and in Wing On Company, specifically to facilitate residents in various districts. The company's business:</p>
<p>1. Selling Passenger Tickets All domestic and foreign train, boat, plane, and road passenger tickets are sold at the set price, and no handling fees are charged.</p>
<p>2. Applying for Passports Travelers who travel far feel that applying for passports is difficult. Sometimes they do not understand the procedures, or they may make mistakes in their schedules. In view of this, the agency specially collects passports for customers, strives to simplify the procedures, and strives for speed. Although it is more difficult now, it will still do its best to help travelers.</p>
<p>3. Transporting Luggage Travelers consider luggage to be the most difficult thing. The agency has trucks to transport luggage for customers. Whether it is from the port to the residence, or from the residence to the port, everything can be picked up and delivered.</p>
<p>4. Handling Freight The agency believes that customs declaration is the most complicated procedure for cargo transportation. Although there are many customs declaration businesses at sea, they are all unwilling to make the procedures public and keep special secrets. The agency has specially set up a freight department to handle cargo transportation and customs declaration matters for all sectors of society.</p>
<p>5. Hotels and Hostels in Various Places The agency believes that the facilities of hotels in large cities are very perfect, but it is extremely difficult to find food and accommodation in the interior, so the agency has established hostels in various places one after another. One is located at the hub of transportation, such as Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Beijing, Xi'an, Nanchang, etc.; the other is located in scenic areas, such as Huangshan, Xuebaoshan, Jinhua, Huashan, Hengshan, etc. Strict attention is paid to cleanliness, hygiene, and attentive service. Since the outbreak of the war, the southwest and northwest have become gathering places for Chinese people. Because development has not been long, the transportation network has not yet been completed, and the standard of living is still very difficult. Therefore, a year ago, on the main transportation routes in the southwest and northwest, it can be said with certainty that there was no better travel agency or food station to find for food and accommodation. After a year of hard work, the agency has established hostels along the transportation routes in the southwest and northwest, and has opened branch offices in more important places, all of which are doing their best to facilitate travelers. If we go to the southwest and northwest to travel, we should know that today's southwest and northwest are no longer the southwest and northwest of the past, and today's travel agency is no longer the travel agency of the past.</p>
<p>6. Travel Books and Newspapers The Travel Magazine has been published for 13 years and is mainly dedicated to promoting Chinese scenic spots, advocating travel, and developing the transportation industry. It is published once a month, and it also compiles and prints travel guides, which detail the prices and schedules of trains, boats, planes, and cars across the country, as well as luggage costs, for travelers to refer to. In addition, it also prints special guide books for various places and illustrated books on the general situation of transportation in various places at any time. Everything that can guide travelers to travel conveniently is completed without hesitation in terms of financial and material resources.</p>
<p>7. Guiding Tours Whether a group or an individual travels to various places in China (or even to Europe and the United States), if they do not understand the various situations, the agency can plan and guide the tour for them. Detailed answers are provided for boat, car, food, and accommodation expenses, and various tours and travels are held in various places at any time, welcoming people from all walks of life to join. Therefore, the agency can be called a seller of mountains, rivers, and scenic spots.</p>
<p>8. Travel Checks Carrying travel expenses in boats and cars is extremely inconvenient. The agency purchases travel checks from the Shanghai Bank for customers. They are commonly used in all major cities and are extremely safe and easy to use.</p>
<p>Conclusion Overall, if we look at the current situation of the travel business in Shanghai, we cannot expect its development, but the future is bright and promising. There is much to be done in the future. Today's prosperity and decline is a precursor to the future's decline and prosperity. Moreover, the travel business does not rely on the prosperity of the market, nor does it determine the increase or decrease in business according to the governance or chaos of national affairs. When other industries are prosperous, the travel business can develop to the best of its ability and will never end. However, often when various industries are depressed and the market is simplified, the travel business can have a tortuous progress. In short, those who are in charge of the matter must be able to use their brains to serve travelers wholeheartedly and seek welfare for the public.</p>

<h3>(4) Inner Treasures</h3>
<p>A certain gentleman toiled all his life, always wanting to get rich. After he died, his house was mortgaged to others, but someone discovered that there were hidden treasures in the walls of the house. Unfortunately, this gentleman spent his whole life running around, but he did not discover the infinite wealth that was hidden in his own house! Today, many people are rushing about, seeking nothing more than external things, but they do not know their own inner treasures! Reader, have you discovered that what is hidden in you is a soul endowed by God, with God's character and God's holiness? We must not be short-sighted, but be in the arena of fame and fortune, blinded by material desires, so that the inner treasures are forever buried in sin and transgression! Human organization has spirit, soul, and body. The body is the tool of the soul and spirit, the soul is the organ of communication with oneself, and has the sense to know how to protect its own interests. The spirit is the organ of communication with God, and can distinguish right from wrong and know how to glorify God and benefit people. Today, if people can let God dominate the soul and the body, they can restore the status of the original person. Therefore, I hope that my dear readers will discover the precious spirituality in themselves, and rely on God's great love for us. When we are dead in sin and transgression, only believing in God can bring us back to life with Christ Jesus, because we are saved by grace and by faith. ——Shanghai Christian Literature Outreach Association Post Office Box 1227.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of the China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steamship Bureau has now rented the old base of Yisheng Foreign Firm, and is repairing it. It will be completed in half a month and can be moved into. It is found that this bureau has been very prosperous recently, which is very different from the time when it was first established. Many Shanghai silver masters want to join the shares. However, the bureau's capital is already sufficient, totaling one million taels of silver, divided into one hundred shares. The ship was sent to Nagasaki and Kobe the other day, and it is planned to travel between Shanghai and Japan on a regular basis. The ship is named Yidun, but it costs more coal. Fortunately, the price of coal in Nagasaki is very cheap, and it is also very convenient to handle it along the way.</p>
<h3>Yin Gang Night Market</h3>
<p>Ten miles southwest of Wusong, there is a place called Yingang, with dozens of households, which is not deserted; and its transactions are all at night. During the day, every household is closed, and even tea houses and wine markets are deserted, with no one there, and the doors are half-open and closed. When the lights are turned on, everything is done, and everything from firewood, rice, oil, and salt to all kinds of crafts is opened for business. The stalls for picking melons and selling vegetables each have a lamp, which is used to weigh things and count money. Villagers who trade silk and cloth also come in droves, and they go home with wine and meat after finishing their goods, and it is past midnight. Although officials have repeatedly banned it, it cannot be changed. The money sold last night was suddenly found to be mostly paper ashes. In the future, it is planned to set up a water basin for each stall to put money in to verify its authenticity. However, it is ultimately impossible to change the normal practice of trading during the day.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Sacrifices Himself for Rain</h3>
<p>A certain county under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang Prefecture was suffering from a severe drought. Repeated prayers were ineffective. The county magistrate carried the statue of the City God to the hot sun, accusing him of his duty to protect the land. He also wore his official uniform and was exposed to the sun with the statue from morning to night, without eating a grain of rice. However, the City God's clay statue was still intact; and the county magistrate's flesh body could not eat the new grain, because he died of heat stroke after being exposed to the sun for seven days. This official can truly be said to have worked diligently to the point of death.</p>

<h3>The First International Refugee Camp Affiliated Radio Training Class</h3>
<p>— Wen Xia</p>
<p>The training period is six months, and there is no problem with the way out.</p>
<p>The recently publicly performed results were not bad.</p>
<p>Hardoon Garden Will Open</p>
<p>The sustenance of Shanghai refugees has always been a problem. Many people in charge of refugee camps are worried about the future funding of the refugees. Recently, I heard that someone is contacting the owner of Hardoon Garden, hoping to open a resolution. After the opening, the tickets can earn at least 100,000 yuan, and the refugee expenses for two months in the summer can be</p>
<p>It is said that Mrs. Hardoon has not yet agreed. For the sake of the food and support of hundreds of thousands of refugees, Mrs. Hardoon, who is good at doing good deeds, does not seem to have to insist any longer. If this plan can be realized, it would be a really good thing.</p>
<p>Hardoon Garden was opened once or twenty years ago (it is said that the scenery inside is excellent). Now, if it is opened again, it is indeed a rare grand event!</p>
<p>The above news can only be regarded as an incidental report.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in order to visit the radio training class for orphans affiliated to the First International Refugee Camp on Masnan Road, I also received an unfortunate message, that is, this refugee camp has been ordered by the General Assembly, and is now evacuating refugees, so that those with hometowns and occupations will slowly leave the refugee camp, and want to end the refugee camp in the near future.</p>
<p>Although we cannot say that refugees must rely on refugee camps forever, the financial difficulties of the relief society are evident here. The address of the First International Refugee Camp was originally the exchange field of Aurora University. Aurora has urged several times to take it back for its own use. It seems that the First Refugee Camp will have to end soon.</p>
<p>When I went yesterday, I saw packages and scattered objects piled up in front of the reed shed door of the refugee camp. Presumably these are the belongings of the refugees who are leaving.</p>
<p>I had a half-hour talk with Mr. Pan, the director of the camp, and Mr. Li Fucheng, the director of the education group. They led me to visit the classroom of the radio class. It was already noon, and the 16- or 17-year-old male and female refugee children were eating their most meager lunch at the desks in their classroom.</p>
<p>On the 11th, this radio class invited the managers of several radio companies in Shanghai, such as Mr. Li Weishou and Mr. Yang Shufen, as judges to hold a radio communication performance.</p>
<p>The method of performance was to use an English manuscript, which was sent by the professor using radio code, and the male and female students received it on the spot; the second step was for the students to send and receive it themselves.</p>
<p>It is said that the performance that day was not bad.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Fucheng said: The students in this training class were originally recommended by the three refugee camps of the International Refugee Camp, and many people were also recommended by other refugee camps.</p>
<p>When it first started, there were 50 or 60 people. Later, those with insensitive vision and hearing were removed, and now the total number of students in the class is 34. There are six or seven girls.</p>
<p>The training steps are divided into two types: first, the primary training class, which focuses on receiving and sending reports; the second is the advanced training class, which focuses on the repair and installation of transceivers. The training time is six months.</p>
<p>According to the current allocation of time and curriculum, six months is of course quite short. If the students can work hard, they can of course cope.</p>
<p>According to Director Pan, the way out can be completely no problem after six months of training, because various places are in great need of this talent.</p>
<p>The coaches are Mr. Zhang Heqing and Mr. Wang Shuling. They are completely obligated and do not receive salaries. This spirit is very admirable.</p>
<p>On the production side of the center, we are also planning to manufacture red and blue ink. After many trials, this plan has been approved by the General Office, and large products will be manufactured soon.</p>
<p>It is said that the difficulties in this first refugee camp are that every person is a productive worker. Some have jobs outside, and some work in the camp. It is indeed very difficult for a refugee camp to do this.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I also visited the nursery set up in the center for the refugees. When I visited, there were a dozen children, six or seven years old, sitting at a short rectangular table eating. They were all fat and chubby. One of them stood up and bowed to me. I smiled and nodded to him. He immediately turned to his partner and said:</p>
<p>"He nodded to me!"</p>
<p>Mr. Pan and Mr. Ji and I all laughed.</p>
<p>The innocence of the children is so cute in these places.</p>
<h3>"The Outlaw" Impressions</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Jesse James"</p>
<p>A 20th Century Fox production, showing at the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>The much-touted "The Outlaw" finally premiered at the Grand Theater without raising ticket prices. The cast is impressive: Tyrone Power, Nancy Kelly, Henry Fonda, etc.; the director is King Henry; and it's a color film. However, comparing "The Outlaw" to "Robin Hood" seems inappropriate. First, "Robin Hood" relies on the strength of the masses to defeat the enemy, while "The Outlaw" depends solely on the individual bravery of Frank and Jesse. They roam the American West, leading to Jesse's eventual betrayal by his fellow gang member Ford. Second, Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Tyrone Power's Jesse are different; this difference is probably determined by physique. In several scenes, Tyrone Power's Jesse does indeed shed his past image as a romantic lead, but compared to Errol Flynn, he lacks his heroic and agile demeanor.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, director King Henry doesn't focus on Jesse's actions. These only occupy a small number of scenes: robbing a train, breaking out of jail, robbing a bank. However, his small, exquisite details are handled very vividly and dynamically, such as Frank and Jesse fighting Brazil, Frank's arrangements before the jailbreak, and the portrayal of Chill's uncle, Luo Fushi. These details make many dull scenes come alive.</p>
<p>Conversely, King Henry dedicates almost all his energy to the love between Jesse and Chill. After McCook pretends not to pursue Jesse's past and only imposes a five-year prison sentence, Chill gently advises Jesse to abandon evil and return to the right path. Chill and Jesse get married in a church. After the jailbreak, they hide in the mountains. After Chill gives birth, she resolutely lives with her chivalrous uncle for the sake of her future. Finally, Jesse is betrayed by Ford for personal gain, is injured during a bank robbery, and the two scenes before he is about to go to California are particularly emphasized, making the separation and death of this couple as tender and poignant as possible.</p>
<p>Nancy Kelly's Chill delivers a very profound and moving performance in the aforementioned scenes.</p>
<p>However, I prefer the first half of the movie. It makes people realize that we must eliminate these gangsters to live and work in peace, and that all sweet words are poisonous. We, in "this time, this place," should be vigilant. Even the visual weaving of the first half of the movie is tight and powerful.</p>
<p>Henry Fonda has too few scenes.</p>
<p>As for the color, one scene is particularly lovely: Jesse jumps onto a train, the train is speeding, Jesse is crawling on the roof, above is the azure sky, below the windows reflect the faces under the electric lights, and the carriage is a reddish-brown color. In these three different layers of color, it is not only pleasing to the eye but also demonstrates the special effectiveness of color film.</p>
<h3>How to Define "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (Spiritual Rhythm and Living Movement) in Painting</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese painting is one of the arts, and also one of the national treasures. To love art is inherent in human nature, so to study art is originally a very interesting thing. But whether it is Chinese painting or Western painting, the most important condition is "qi yun" (spiritual rhythm). I don't understand Western painting, so let's talk about Chinese painting.</p>
<p>In the past, Xie He said that there are six principles in painting: first, "qi yun," second, "gu fa" (bone method), third, "ying wu xiang xing" (correspond to objects and depict their forms), fourth, "sui lei fu cai" (apply colors according to type), fifth, "jing ying wei zhi" (manage the position), and sixth, "chuan mo yi xie" (copy and transfer). Among the six principles, "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual rhythm and living movement) is the first. In fact, how can the two words "qi yun" be a principle? The so-called principle must have rules and laws to follow, and must have standards and signs to adhere to. But "qi yun" is an empty and ethereal thing, which can be understood intuitively but cannot be conveyed in words. So why did the ancients put the two words "qi yun" at the head of the six principles?</p>
<p>From beginning to end, "qi yun" is the most important, and has always been so. A painting without "qi yun" is like a person without a soul. A person without a soul is a walking corpse, not a person. A painting without "qi yun" is just carving and piling, how can it be called a painting? The ancients said that calligraphy and painting come from the same source, so those who are good at calligraphy must be good at painting, and those who are good at painting must be good at calligraphy. But everyone can write characters, and how many people in ancient and modern times can be called good at calligraphy? There are countless painters in ancient and modern times, but how many of their paintings are enough to be passed down through the ages?</p>
<p>The ancients said that the diseases of painters are all related to the use of the brush, namely three: one is stiffness, two is sharpness, and three is knotting. If you suffer from these three diseases, your painting, no matter how elaborate, is not worth seeing. Wen Zhengming said: "Dropping ink on paper is not a trivial matter. You must have nothing in your mind, and then the mist, clouds, and beautiful scenery, and the life-generating energy of heaven and earth will naturally gather." Dong Qichang said: ""Qi yun" cannot be learned, it is naturally given by heaven, but there are also places to learn it. Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, and clear the turbidity in your mind. Naturally, hills and valleys will be in your mind, and everything you write at hand will be a vivid landscape." Deng Chun's painting bridge says: "The appearance is very important. The myriad things that fill the world all contain the mystery of thinking with a brush, and the reason why they can fully express it is only one method. What is that one? It is "chuan shen" (transmit the spirit)." This only knows that people have a spirit, but does not know that things have a spirit. This is why Guo Ruoxu deeply despised the many craftsmen, saying that although they are called paintings, they are not paintings, because they can only transmit their form but cannot transmit their spirit. In one word, painting should be a painting with vitality, not a painting without vitality, and it should be a lively painting, not a rigid painting.</p>
<p>Then it can be known that painting should take "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual rhythm and living movement) as the first principle. But what is "qi yun," and what is "sheng dong"? Although the ancients had these words, they never explained them, and could not explain them. The so-called "qi yun sheng dong" can only be understood intuitively and cannot be expressed in words. The ancients could not convey it in words, so how can I convey it? I will give examples of ancient painters' "chuan shen" (transmit the spirit) to substantiate it, so that those who study painting may have some understanding. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A Beauty Avenges Her Enemies, But Cannot Erase Her Karma; Love is Discussed in the Green Window, and Good Fortune is Re-established.</p>
<p>After Pan Peiying found these two letters, she could only cry over them, thinking that the person was already dead, so what else could be said? However, she treasured these two suicide notes. She foolishly thought that if she hadn't written that cold and rejecting reply, perhaps he wouldn't have died. "Although I didn't kill Boren, Boren died because of me." At that time, Pan Peiying's father had also died, and her family had scattered and separated. She was free, but she was lonely and desolate, like a goose separated from its flock. Many people thought she was the daughter of Pan Lao Lao, and were unwilling to get close to her. She also seemed to feel ashamed of herself. If people ignored her, she wouldn't bother with them. At this time, she was teaching in a small school, passing these few years. It was two years after China's complete restoration. One day, she returned to Wuxi and accidentally went to Huishan for a walk. At this time, it was in March, a beautiful spring day. Huishan was much more prosperous than before. It was also a Sunday, and there were many tourists. She couldn't help but think of the past when she was in school, and on Sundays, many classmates would often go hiking together. Sometimes she and Zhao Letian would sit here for a while. Time flew by in an instant, and now they were forever separated. She sat in a place, watching many men and women laughing and talking, but she was just staring blankly in a daze. She didn't expect that someone would walk in front of her and gently call out to her: "Sister Peiying, I haven't seen you in a long time, do you still recognize me?" When Peiying looked up, it was an old female classmate, Yuan Shuwen, who had studied in a certain school together and worked together in the student union. Although her complexion was much older now, her facial features were still the same. Pan Peiying quickly stood up and said, "It's Sister Shuwen, how could I not recognize you? Oh my! Have we been separated for seven or eight years?" Yuan Shuwen said, "It's really been many years since we last met. How is Mr. Zhao doing lately? We haven't seen him in a long time either." Pan Peiying was confused when she heard this, and after a daze, she asked, "Which Mr. Zhao?" Yuan Shuwen said, "I'm asking about Mr. Zhao Letian. At that time, we also worked together in the student union. I didn't expect him to give up his pen and join the army later, he was really so brave! I originally wanted to visit you two, but I always procrastinated and didn't get around to it. Today, it's a coincidence that I ran into an old friend here." Pan Peiying was even more confused when she heard her say this. Because she thought that Zhao Letian was already dead, why did she ask me, "How is his health?" And say, "Visit you two," putting me together with him, isn't that Yuan Shuwen seeing a ghost alive? (138)</p>

<h3>The Fates of Hollywood Stars</h3>
<p>— Gong Shi</p>
<p>New York's prophet Steve publishes the fates of Hollywood's famous male and female stars every year, which is often miraculously accurate. For example, last year's predictions about Tyrone Power winning the highest honor, and Joan Crawford's third divorce, have come true. Therefore, whenever Steve publishes his annual predictions for movie stars, Hollywood becomes the center of conversation, and the movie stars mentioned, especially those with bad luck, are very nervous, fearing that Steve's words will come true. Steve published his annual predictions for Hollywood stars in early May this year. The following are the most interesting translated notes:</p>
<p>Three Famous Plays on the Screen: After the unprecedented success of Bernard Shaw's famous play "Pygmalion" on the screen, three of Shaw's famous plays will be filmed this year, still by MGM. One of them will star the famous actor Clark Gable.</p>
<p>"The Dictator" Cannot Be Released: Although Chaplin's "The Dictator" has long been announced to be filmed, there is no hope of release this year. It will not be publicly screened in New York until mid-July next year. The female lead in the film will not be Paulette Goddard, because Goddard has divorced Chaplin by then.</p>
<p>Three Female Stars Suffer Misfortune: In the second half of 1939, three famous female stars will suffer misfortune: one is Constance Bennett, whose health will have problems; two is Carole Lombard, whose position on the screen will decline and will not be popular with audiences, and will be forced to give up her screen career; three is Katharine Hepburn, who will be injured due to reckless driving.</p>
<p>Many Movie Stars Marry and Divorce: This year, many men and women will marry. The female stars include Olivia de Havilland, Sonja Henie, Loretta Young, and Ann Tery Louise; the male stars include George Brent, David Niven, and On Morris. Joan Crawford will still not be able to find a love interest. There were rumors of marriage between Norma Shearer and a producer, but it did not materialize. There will also be many divorces, including Alice Faye, Jeannette MacDonald, Dick Powell, and Joan Blondell. As for William Powell, he will regain his lover and announce his engagement.</p>
<p>The Unfortunate Quintuplets: The Canadian quintuplets will encounter misfortune in September. Two of them will get sick, and one will be quite dangerous, but the result will be safe. Therefore, only one of the quintuplets' films will be released to the world.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Child Stars: Among child stars, Shirley Temple's reputation is declining. The most successful ones are Tommy Carlin and Mickey Rooney. Freddie Bartholomew is entangled in lawsuits. Baby Baling goes to court for her sister's love affair. There is also a new child star discovered, affiliated with Goldwyn Company.</p>
<h3>Yan Jupeng Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>After Mao Shilai, the Golden Theater has decided to be taken over by Yan Jupeng, Hou Yulan, Ma Liankun, Wang Fushan, and others. (Arriving in Shanghai on the 25th, performing from the 28th). Hou is a top student from the Peking Opera School. This magazine has previously published a photo of her in "Sacrifice to the River," in which Hou plays Sun Shangxiang, with a graceful and dignified manner and a commendable appearance and voice. In recent years, only Zhang Yizhen has been welcomed by the audience in Shanghai, but she is not from a professional background. Without Hu Tiefen's qin accompaniment, it would be difficult to see her brilliance. Yulan graduated from the Peking Opera School, which is equivalent to graduating as a disciple. Her skills are naturally not weak, and it is rare for female actors to study in a professional school. Yulan and Zhao Jinrong are both outstanding talents in the female roles of the Opera School. It is said that Zhao has already married. This time, Hou's coming south with Jupeng is not only related to her personal future, but also can take this opportunity to contribute the achievements of her alma mater to the ladies of Shanghai. The Shanghai opera audience knows the skills of Ma Liankun and Wang Fushan in detail, so there is no need to repeat them. The Golden authorities also intend to keep Gao Shenglin, Jiang Shiyu, and Qiu Shengrong to play with Jupeng. Shenglin has been in the limelight this time, and has been promoted from the third rank to the second rank. Shengrong is the son of the famous net Qiu Guixian. Although he is slightly small in stature, he takes acting seriously and has a family background. If he co-stars in "Complete Da Bao Guo" with Jupeng Yulan, he will be able to perform happily and win praise. Jupeng has not performed in Shanghai for a long time, and his voice has greatly improved recently. The supporting roles he brings are also very neat. It is expected that this performance will be very successful. (Auction Donation)</p>
<h3>Yan Jupeng's Opera Costumes</h3>
<h3>Two Shanghai Opera Troupes Will Go Abroad</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Peony Opera Troupe went abroad to perform in Little Luzon and returned with great success, some people in Shanghai are now mobilizing to organize opera troupes to go overseas. As far as I know, there are two troupes in progress. One is organized by Jin Lianxi, who plans to follow in the footsteps of the Peony Troupe to Little Luzon. The import license for the troupe has been obtained by Hua Zhongxia, a female actor martial artist who has married there. If it can become a reality, it will set off next month. The other is Kun Dan Biyu Zhen, who has agreed on terms with the Singapore representative, Mr. Chen, to organize a troupe to go there. She is also actively inviting actors.</p>
<h3>The Person Yu Shuyan Most Respected</h3>
<p>— Tian Ci</p>
<p>Speaking of Shuyan, his nature is very strange. He only knows how to do things according to his own temper. Even if celebrities invite him to perform in operas, he often refuses when he "doesn't give face." However, he listens only to the late General Li Zhengwu, the commander of the former Guangfu Army, and dares not show his "master's temper." In fact, his "success" and his rise to fame were all thanks to Li Lao's promotion!</p>
<p>It turns out that before he became famous, his situation was just so-so. Later, his art was discovered by Li Lao, who recommended him to his own student, Zhang Zongchang, the "long-legged general" who dominated one side. Zhang took care of him because of the old gentleman's face. Whenever there were performances at Zhang's mansion, he would be called to go, and he would always get a reward of 18,000, so his life was very comfortable. Therefore, he had to give special respect to Li Lao for "drinking water and thinking of the source."</p>
<p>When Great Wall Record Company was established, the company authorities sent someone to invite him to make a record, but he "rejected it from thousands of miles away." The Wei Cheng company then asked Li Lao for help. Li Lao made a long-distance call to Peking, and he immediately wired back "As you wish," without talking about anything else. This was his way of repaying Li Lao's kindness. And the company's having his records is also thanks to Li Lao. So Li Zhengwu can be said to be the person Yu Shuyan most respected.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of Paradise</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yaoqing and Liqing's Later Years are Far Inferior to Fengqing's</p>
<p>Wang Cailin's eldest son is named Yaoqing, the next is Fengqing, and Liqing is the youngest. Yaoqing performed with Tan Xinpei, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Satang, and other famous mustachioed actors on the same stage in Tongqing, China Theater, and Fushou Troupe for a long time, so he became famous very early. At that time, Fengqing and Liqing were not famous. Feng Erfang was singing young male roles. (When Yao Xiang and Liu Bo jointly operated the China Theater. Fengqing had already changed to old male roles). Liqing was also learning and acting. In the beginning, the family expenses were mostly borne by Yaoqing. He was originally a loyal and honest person, and he didn't care even if he had to pay a few more dollars each month for these things to support his younger brothers. However, women are narrow-minded after all, and Wang's grandmother is a nosy and talkative person, so bad feelings arose between the sisters-in-law. The Fengqing couple were forced by circumstances, and even though they often heard idle talk, they had to swallow their anger and dare not show any displeasure. Later, Yaoqing suddenly lost his voice, and his voice collapsed (losing his voice in middle age, the term "collapsed voice" is what actors fear most, because it is easier for young people to recover their voice after it collapses, but once it collapses, there is no hope of recovery, and Gao Qingkui has this problem now.). At the same time, Fengqing became very popular after changing to acting in the Pai-style mustachioed role. Compared with the two, it was the opposite of the past. As Lanfang's reputation grew, Fengqing's value naturally increased. Every time Lanfang went to Shanghai and Hankou to perform, the fee would be 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Fengqing would be able to get a huge sum of 8,000 to 9,000 yuan each time. Moreover, since his eldest son Shaoqing became Lanfang's erhu player, he could also earn two or three thousand yuan a month. Sometimes Mei, Wang, accepting hall performances and Hong Kong film matters, the Fengqing father and son could get extra income, so for many years, Feng Er's private property was almost 100,000 yuan. He is a man of few words and lazy to interact with the outside world. When there is no opera, he stays at home all day long. He and his old wife smoke together. (39)</p>
<h3>The Latest Stage Invites Xun Huisheng and His Son Xun Lingxiang to Come Together</h3>
<p>— Yi Yin</p>
<p>—The Second Batch Has Attempts to Connect With Zhao Ruquan—</p>
<p>Dong Yong took over the Latest Stage in the name of Jin Xin Company. The initial plan was to connect with Li Wanchun. Who knew that Li Wanchun had gone to Harbin! This has to change the policy, and to contact Xun Huisheng separately. At present, this matter has been largely settled. Xun Huisheng will bring his son Xun Lingxiang (photo see this magazine on the 9th) to Shanghai to perform at the Latest. In addition, the old team of the Carter Grand Theatre, including Lan Yuechun and Wang Guiwu, will also move to the Latest to perform at that time.</p>
<p>Following Xun Huisheng and Xun Lingxiang, the Latest has the intention to invite Zhao Ruquan's opera troupe. Zhao Ruquan is now in Kunming. Recently, a family newspaper arrived in Shanghai. It is said that the entire team of Zhao's troupe will return to Shanghai in three batches. Zhang Guifen and others are the first batch, Zhao Junyu and others are the second batch, and Zhao Ruquan himself is in the third batch. The Latest has sent a letter to Kunming to inquire about the exact date of return to Shanghai. Whether this matter can be successfully negotiated depends on the results of the consultations after Zhao Ruquan returns to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Dancing World Scenery (27)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>On the Advertising Problem of Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Regarding this issue, I think there are several points that should be noted and discussed. I will write them down below for the authorities to consider:</p>
<p>1.  Do dance halls really need to advertise? To study this point, we must first study why we advertise. The answer must be to attract customers. Then, does advertising necessarily bring customers? Conversely, does not advertising necessarily mean no customers? This question is difficult to answer. Some may say that advertising will always bring more customers than not advertising, but this answer seems too vague. What is the principle and what is the basis for this? In my opinion, dance halls do not need to advertise every day, but when there are changes in decoration, dancers, or bands, it is necessary to advertise. The meaning of advertising is to let people know my advantages. As for whether they come or not after knowing, it depends on whether my advantages suit their tastes. However, one thing can be said with certainty: customers knowing my advantages does not guarantee they will come, but not knowing guarantees they will not come. Therefore, we can conclude that advertising is indeed necessary.</p>
<p>2.  The wording of advertisements should be in line with reality: This not only relates to the issue of credibility but also has a significant impact on actual business operations. People will only be fooled once. Even if you cheat them once, they will become suspicious. I remember once wanting to see a movie, and when I looked at its advertisement, it said something like "Come early to reserve your seat, or you will be left standing" (I don't remember the exact words, but that was the general meaning). At that time, it was only five minutes before the movie started. I said that we wouldn't be able to find seats, so it would be better not to go. My friend said that the advertisement was probably just exaggerating, so he dragged me along. By the time we entered, the movie had already started, and we could sit anywhere from the first row to the last. From then on, whenever we saw advertisements for this theater, no matter how wonderful they sounded, we would never believe them.</p>
<p>3.  Choosing which newspapers to advertise in: As the saying goes, "Radishes and greens, each to his own." Each newspaper has its own readers. When dance hall authorities want to publish an advertisement, it is best to first think about the content of the advertisement and which group of people it is most suitable for. Then, think about which newspapers that group of people is likely to read. This way, the advertisement will be more effective. As far as I know, the Shanghai newspapers with the largest circulation are of course the Shen and Xin newspapers. Generally, larger industrial and commercial organizations have both. Smaller shops tend to read Xinwen Bao more often. If it is a respectable family and citizens with purchasing power, they seem to read Shen Bao more. In my relatives' and friends' families, about seven or eight out of ten read Shen Bao, so you can often find them at the Paramount and Ciro's.</p>
