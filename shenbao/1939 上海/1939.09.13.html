<p>柏林　據德國新聞通訊社消息、德軍自北方前進、未遇任何抵抗、刻正迫近維斯吐拉河、拿破崙所造之穆特林要塞、已在德軍砲火射程之下、按該要塞位於維斯吐拉河右岸、居維斯吐拉·布格·那萊甫三河合流處、在華沙西北二十英里、一九一五年俄軍曾以那萊甫河保衛華沙、以抗興登堡軍、此問無錢電臺並宣布、德軍刻正長驅而入波蘭實業區洛資城、按該城位於華沙西南八十二英哩、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞京城　羅馬尼亞之軍隊、今日開始向蘇聯邊界集中、聞地尼斯特方面、蘇聯向無特別警備、惟最近則蘇聯在該處亦建築防禦工程、故羅馬尼亞亦不能不有警備措置、總之、羅馬尼亞之防禦工程、全在法國之南路軍與西路軍之手、（十二日美聯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際共同信念之整理與推進</h3>
<p>师代之治政治學者，必知國家體制之所由確立，實亦其構成分子之信念爲基礎之一。國人擁護共和，斯共和；尊重法治，憲法始成軌範；臣民愛戴君主，於是爲王國，爲獨裁；若干邦相需相成，於是爲聯邦，爲邦聯。夫豈學者空論，腐儒迂談？顚撲不破之至理存焉，蔚爲經世之鐵則；以此論國際，竊信亦然。</p>
<p>數年以來，世人於國際之正義黯澹，文明逆轉，漸成無政府狀態，深致慨歎；顧亦止於慨歎，未嘗力求伸張。世人於暴力侵略，亦所深惡；顧亦止於深惡，未嘗決心痛絕。循數年來之氣象言之，雖曰矛盾錯綜，危機遍伏，幾難置信於今年今日，竟有戰事若此。即使戰，僅如中國戰日本；波蘭而非馴伏如捷克奧地利，殆將僅如阿比西利亞，阿爾巴尼亞，盡彼人事而獨戰德國耳。詎知英法竟攘臂而起，拔劍相助；此則我人於半月之前猶所不敢作此論斷，亦德國元首希特勒所愕然驚駭。不甯唯是，彼蘇聯之棄英法而與德國締結互不侵犯條的，從日本之平沼內閣解體而首相人選及於阿部，或亦以德波或有問題，英法無意決鬬。爲蘇日假定前提之一端歟，此則英法崛起後，於我人作此遐想，而不能自己者也。何也？數年來之英法所表見者，有所慨歎，有所深惡，顧未見其愛正義，愛文明，愛國際秩序，乃能如愛其國內之一切也；我人作如是觀，蘇聯乃至日本德國，殆亦作如是觀。</p>
<p>及茲英法對德宣戰可旬日，旬日之間，英法之所以宣明其作戰意義者，有如聯珠。即以英國言之：有國王喬治六世之詔書，首相張伯倫氏之廣播演說，外相哈立法克斯氏之議院演說，新任海軍大臣邱吉爾氏之論文，新任海外自治領大臣艾登氏之廣播演說，以及英政府致國聯之照會，不勝羅舉。其間要義，概爲四點：（一）非爲寫遠之城市（但澤自由市）發生爭議而戰，非有讐恨於德國民族而戰，亦非圖毀滅德國；（二）爲踐行對波蘭之義務，（三）反對暴力侵略，臀懲背信，伸張正義，保障自由，恢復國際秩序，建樹永久和平；（四）國社主義一日存在，則文明世界一日不能實現，故必爭取全勝，決不半途而廢。無不慷慨陳辭，備見浩然正氣。我人於逖聽之餘，不惟了然於英法赴戰之意義、，深信於英法如此抱負，如此信念；抑且估定此决戰爭必於人類文明，國際福利，有其無上價値；於事實則英法可勝，於道理則英法應勝。</p>
<p>雖然，竊猶有不足之感焉。蓋數年來英法所表見者，既未嘗若此决宣戰後之辭嚴而義正；况宣戰前後，動輒以德國未能接受和平談判爲德國咎。試一考量之：宣戰而絕對嚴正，豈得貫澈之於談判？然則宣戰前夕之建議談判，究何所求？謂亦得以談判使德國捐棄其威脅世界文明之國社主義乎？談判而舉行，將何解於種種眞誠之抱負與信念乎？於是言之，我人雖於今日之英法，同情之，信任之，然英法之中心意識，今昔分爲數橛焉；英法之實際行動，亦於最近短時期內分爲數段落焉；及經波折，復加整理，始如今日，是則厚愛英法者所不能爲英法諱也。惟有所不能諱者若此，故未能於國際遽得最普遍之感應。例如在美國：不利於英法之現行中立法，有待修正；而昨日電傳，召集國會臨時會議猶未可遽期；此在昌言反對之參議員波拉，或囿於黨爭，或病在識見短淺，或褊持孤立之成見，或沾染他國宣傳之流毒，因是而英法種種眞誠之抱負與信念不足使之感應，是不具論，即賢明如總統羅斯福氏與國務卿赫爾氏，自英法對德宣戰以來，、除爲美國宣吿中立而外，亦尙未作何强有力之表示；此豈總統國務卿之「正義感」有所不足哉！</p>
<p>凡事有非假以時間不濟者，瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成，事之自然者也，顧於其熟，於其到，必須時間，雖挾雷霆萬鈞之力不可得之俄頃也。於以知英法之貫澈其信念，感應於國際，皆有待於其中心意識確立後之相當時日；宣戰一旬，僅爲確立中心意識之始耳。於其既始，持之彌堅，行之彌苦，且有以證明其態度之嚴正，信念之堅定；今日然，他日亦然，對德國然，在歐洲然，推而至於遠東與太平洋無不然，則終必普遍感應國際，有可斷言。國際對此，若形成共同之信念，則正義文明與秩序之必確立，亦可斷言。國際既往之病態，在於知所慨歎而不力求，知所深惡而不痛絕；英法在對德宣戰之前，亦坐此病；及至今茲，中國與英法以外之各國，猶旬日前之英法，徒呻吟而已。各國朝野能守法，能愛國忠君，故其國之體制昌明；而國際昌明則有待於各國確立其共同信念；英法之赴戰，其國際共同信念發揮光大之始歟！</p>

<h3>厦門日方首要人物　水戶春造與澤重信（續）</h3>
<p>海軍派壓倒厦門派　厦門通竟勞而無功</p>
<p>厦門日軍特務機關長、雖然是澤川、最活動的却是情報部長澤重信、厦門失陷前好幾年間、澤重信早以台灣總督府特派員資格來厦活動、所謂特派員、就是間諜頭目、他供給台灣總督府以厦門方面情報、手下豢養着一羣日本人台灣人、那時候他還是半公開半秘密地活動、民國二十三年、澤重信兼任日方文化侵略機關全閩日報社長、才公然以報人資格出面活動、而全閩報也成爲日方駐廈的情報機關、澤重信說得一口流利厦門話、也說得很好的國語、秉性陰險機警、在日方特務部裏、他是一個有名的「支那通」、雖然他活動的範圍不大、他的時間幾乎完全躭擱在厦門、但祇少可以說是一個「厦門通」、厦門的一切情形、他都一淸二楚、厦門幾個比較有地位的人士的行動品性、他也全都明瞭、</p>
<p>去年厦門失陷後、日方爲製造偽組織、費了不少心血、澤重信旣然是「厦門通」、搜羅傀儡的責任、便落在他的頭上、他奔波在厦鼓香港之間、他曾三請避港的厦門商會長洪曉春、洪氏爲了表示堅決起見、走避安南、這使得澤重信碰了一鼻子灰、懊喪地回厦門去、恰好這時候張鳴挾着復興社招牌、從東京飛到厦門來、遂由張出頭、拉攏周壽卿·洪景皓、馬馬虎虎地於六月二十日成立偽厦門治安維持會、日方雖然不大瞧得起這些傀儡、因爲沒處另找、祇好將就、去冬、張鳴出走、周壽卿避滬、洪景皓逃遁、僞組織幾乎塌台、澤重信復自吿奮勇、出面搜羅傀儡、再度僕僕於厦鼓粤港問、經過了幾個月的奔波、終於給拉攏到李思賢、當他從香港挾着這個寳貝回厦時、日方首要皆大歡喜、李遂由偽司法主任而偽會長而偽市長、成爲厦門日方玩弄中的一個活寳貝、</p>

<h3>金融港帮買意復萌　現金重臻四千元關</h3>
<p>昨日現金粭赤暗盤市况、初隨外匯鬆動而趨下落、後受港帮猛購、遂背馳上騰、終則以當日高峯收盤、蓋一般散戶鑒於港幣二日來進胃之健、日金價雖連漲二日、但照外匯晚收價核算、尙猛撳（英金計千〇五十元美匯為五千二百三十六元）一千〇五十元至一千二百三十六元、致多數均擬待善價而沾出、故前途或有續漲可能、粭赤初開、因外匯趨鬆、進者觀望、降落至三千八百八十元低價開盤、嗣經證券帮拉提、遂回上至三千九百三十元、俄一度因銀樓帮　拋塞、復撳小至三千八百八十元、後因證券帮與某錢兌業突受香港客帮之委託、傾向收購、　遂飛躍至三千九百五十元、午刻買風稍戢、回落至三千九百三十元收盤、午後初時尙平、不久因香港帮買意復萌、雖某金號及銀樓帮等均有供塞、無如仍感杯水車薪、難遏勢燄、致結果遂以四千元頂價收盤、較上日又猛漲七十元、全天交易熱鬧、約二千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則軋漲五元、　　與中英純金等仍　　、</p>
<p>粭赤　七十元</p>
<p>自每　　、初開因外匯帶硬、買方　意淡薄、且某金號等均來塞出、延至九悍二十五分開市、竟　小五十元、某金號實予錢兌業　兩、價為三千八百八十元、開後因錢兌業頻來吸收、兼證券帮亦趁低搜羅、不久即回起五十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、價為三千九百三十元、時忽聞英金長至四辦士、致散戶賣風又起、銀樓帮亦來套賣、遂再回低至三千八百八十元、此後因證券帮買風復盛、與錢兌業等競相力吸、雖某金號多頭乘機出籠、但頭寸仍感不敷分配、價竟飛漲七十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、為三千九百五十元、將近午刻、因證券帮已正進觀望、且銀樓帮及某金號等續來拋塞、致價回落三十元、金號互做二十兩、為三千九百二十元、作午收價、午後初開抬高十元、現金號售予錢兌業十兩、為三千九百三十元、繼又吐予錢兌業三十兩、價為三千九百二十五元、時香港帮突委託證券帮及某錢兌業猛進、加之售者多觀望不前、價乃飛升五十五元、證券帮進金號二十兩、為三千九百八十元、後因銀樓帮等拋塞、回落二十元、銀樓帮賣予證券十兩、為三千九百六十元、入後因證券帮及錢兌業復代港帮搜購、雖某金號與銀樓帮及散戶等均有塞出、但均乘機扳價、致又猛抬四十元、證券帮進銀樓帮錢兌業及某銀號共五十兩、為四千元、作晚收價、結果比上日又軋漲七十元、聞收復證券帮又進錢兌業及某銀號等共百兩、價為四千元、及三千九百九十五元、全天一百二十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照粭赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>掛高五元</p>
<p>銀　首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行　懸四百元、迨至九時四十分掛小五元、下午二時三十三分回上五元、四時〇五分又掛高五元、結果軋大五元、計大同行改懸四百〇五元、新同行為四百〇三元、收進須減低二十元光景、</p>
<p>關純金均呆定</p>
<p>十一日倫敦電英純金每盎斯仍必八鎊八先令、致中央銀行之各行市價仍均呆而不動、</p>
<h3>外匯穩定</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌揭曉、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、因國內外均無足以左右市面之消息、故各方人心大部觀望、致中途無甚變化、潛勢亦極形平衡、初雖沙遜與港電等續來塞出、但外行吃胃尙佳、而華商投機家則進出不一、惟一度英金曾長至四辦士、美匯亦曾硬達六元七五以上、均為銀行吃進價、結果賣價以英金三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元六二五收盤、較上日英微鬆、而美則平、此乃受國外匯兌軋縮之故、本月期貨趨勢與現貨相若、全天交易清淡異常、</p>
<h3>沙遜首先來賣出</h3>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期、均縮三七五、紐約銀價小六二五、對滬大一二五、對法跌五十生丁、美對英降八七五、對滬未更、對法長三分七五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士九三七五、美匯六元六二五、較之前收均平、開後西商沙遜首來塞予外行現貨英金三辦士九六八七五、並吐予某行現貨美匯六元六八七五、故為狀頗穩、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小二分二五、比後香港亦來電售予匯豐現貨英金四辦士、時英行有利吸納同行現貨英金三辦士九六八七五、是以為狀仍甚平庸、將近午刻、華商突來吸收某行現貨美匯六元六二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元六二五、比晨開英微硬零三一二五、美則無榮辱、</p>
<h3>英金曾到四辦士</h3>
<p>後市情况頗形沉寂、市勢極穩、聞沙遜復來塞予匯豐現貨英金四辦士、又吐予某行現貨美匯六元六八七五、入後華商售予某行現貨美匯六元七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士九六八七五、美匯六元六二五、本月份英金三辦士九三七五、美匯六元五六二五、結果比上日英金現期均微鬆〇三一二五、美匯則均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>香港申匯昨回升</h3>
<p>香港十二日電、今日匯市開盤平穩、英美日各日匯不動、申匯現貨升五元、為三百六十元、有行無市、十時四十五分市面甚穩、申匯現貨續升十元、為三百七十元、十一時三十分各匯均站原盤、惟美匯及申匯現貨、均屬有行無市、下午二時三十時開盤平穩無榮辱、後收割美現貨鬆一二五、為二十五元二五、申匯現貨回降四元、為三百六十六元、全日申匯比升十一元、</p>
<h3>天津美匯略見緊</h3>
<p>天津十二日電、今日匯市開盤、對英現貨不動、仍開三便士四三七五、對美現貨緊一二五、為五元六二五、（以上英美兩匯價恐電碼錯誤、尙待後證）、申匯微升七角半、為一百二十元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤二元、為九十一元、</p>
<h3>外幣跌多漲少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、互有漲落、計英金票跌五角、美金票初尙堅硬、同業互做價為十五元二角半、繼則步退至十五元零五分、結果亦小五分、法郎票降一分、坎拿大票落一角、英美金鎊則隨金價各漲五角及二元不等、前者為九十四元、後者為九十七元、日金票初做一元三角七分左右、卒為一元三角五分七厘、結果回小七厘、朝鮮票亦降五厘、價為一元一角六分、</p>
<h3>英美銀價轉縮　印銀漲落不一</h3>
<p>十一日倫敦電、銀市印度及投機家賣出、少供給、市面平、收盤後、市況帶呆、進者知足大條銀、近遠期均縮三七五紐約銀電、美現貨小六二五、又孟買銀電、印銀市況平靜、現貨跌二安那、期貨均升二安那、成交單共計百張、</p>
<h3>貼現拆息均不動</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、仍無變化、每千元初為一百四十元、一度高至一百四五十元、午刻回平、仍為一百四十元、下午未見更動、仍一百四十元與上日價同、錢業公會拆息早午兩市仍為二角二分云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債回漲</h3>
<p>像皮股獨佔優勢</p>
<p>證券昨日暗盤市况、趨勢略堅、但仍轉入盤旋狀况、各帮人氣懈怠、市塲集會人數稀少、上午漲風初起、下午又覺無力、人心閑散淡漠、大都均在靜待時局之變化、昨日上午初開、天生聯和買進、惟以五號及四十二號又來出籠、趨勢初堅後疲、後以松茂及散戶進胃尙濃、居然丙種獨出三元關、大慶又乘高脫手、午後交易稀少、聯益昨有進量、永康又得價求售、餘祇少數點綴而已、昨日結果略見回好三五角、成交總數不過四十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大生第三廠股十四辭、價為十五元七角半、</p>
<p>又上海眾業公所報告云、昨日橡皮股最佔優勢、蓋受倫敦與新嘉破生橡皮價格猛升之激勵也、成交數額極大、幾於所有橡皮公司之股、俱曾輪及、市况普遍堅挺、惟交易並不越規、價格進趨、悉依程序、而有節度、怡和紗廠股較形冷落、但上海紗廠股則攀登一百三十元之新高峯、收盤時於是價有買戶、會得豐股漲風亦劇、見三十三元二角半、而鋼業股竟昂達六元四角、上次成交價蓋祇四元七角而已、一般人想像　、對是種含有高度投機性之股票、殆已發見某種內在醞釀之事實、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日電、今日證券市塲之遠東英商公司股票、仍僅少數開出、行情稍見上升、麥加利銀行股漲五先令、為六鎊七先令六便士、匯豐銀行股不動、仍站七十鎊原盤、古拉客林傍橡皮股亦升六便士、為十八先令、其餘股票及中國外債仍無報告、</p>
<h3>英商保安將派息</h3>
<p>本埠英商保安保險有限公司、昨接香港總公司電告、該公司董事會　經決定、於十一月十五日　　中期股息、每股英金十二　　六便士、</p>
<h3>紗花　客銷轉靜　紗市漲勢亦平</h3>
<p>連漲兩日之紗市、昨則因客銷轉清、而船隻已開駛他埠、故現紗交易大為減色、而同業心理、尙抱易漲難跌主義、所以拖進之紗、非特大賺錢不願脫卸、市價仍在穩靜之境、但外匯黑市站在水平綫上、黃金亦在盤旋之中、市塲上新買戶不及昔日之夥、市價除雙馬繼續上升二十元外、其他平平、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、同業某君出來抬價、購買雙馬現貨價為七百七十五元、十包、當時市塲形勢熱烈、但廣帮萬興耳聞喊價甚高、突然出來喊賣出、二十支雙馬現貨僅售七百七十三元十包、市勢立刻壓平、棧單價喊六百八十八元、少頃因客銷不動、市象轉下、雙馬現貨跌至七百六十五元、棧單價至六百七十五元、收盤稍見回上、查半日成交統計一千四百二十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十無了、天女勿動、雙地球漲五元、牧羊漲八元、五福紗八元、今日有紗三百九十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額列左、</p>
<h3>白包花交易熱鬧</h3>
<p>行情再漲一二元</p>
<p>現棉交易、依然起色、華廠申新永安對於二十支以上之原棉、採辦甚鉅、其他廠家、絕少動靜、而青島紗廠辦去已有二三千件之數、本埠日廠納胃已滯、惟同業買賣仍屬熱鬧、白包花衣交易占多數、行情比上日漲一二元不等、蘇北來源日見暢爽、碼到上到通州花約五六百包、又北沙來四百五十包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來因海外運輸日見困難、滬上存底日見減少、各同業均擬靜候善價而沽、故原棉之喊價頗高、祇能紡十六支之白洛區竟索價一百六十餘元、二十支西印度因色光較次、價亦在一百六十元左右、三十支之巴西棉現貨價為二百二元、四十二支之上白美棉價為二百三十餘元、六十支之埃及棉　　隊率之增百分之八、合　　為三百四十餘元、此俱為有青以來之新高價也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日又形活躍、開盤尙　平靜、價格無甚軒輊、後因投機者之購買、及現貨交易漸見起色、並引起大眾之購買、市况更趨高翔、直至收盤、較之上日市價漲起二十七八磅音、印度昨日停市、然預測則較之昨日收盤價漲三羅比、埃及棉六十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　客秈來源不絕　貶價求售</h3>
<p>杜米行市反見昂俏　特錫粳開四十二元</p>
<p>杜米　昨河下無到、車輪包子續到各地新尖、四千餘包、以致厚粳獨俏、店胃亦尙歡迎、結果續漲一元有奇、惟陳新各尖、以到貨絡繹不絕、客販手貨亦夥、羣以先脫為快、故昨市開手、各尖即一路下瀉二元左右、直至近午跌透、始引起本街動辦、故收盤形勢、已較帶緊矣、計做開特錫粳四十二元、高貨四十一元至四十元、蘇同崑粳四十元·三十九元七角及三十九元、河下早晚稻三十五元半至三十四元六角、包子三十八元二角至三十七元半、江北尖初開即落一元、為二十六元半、至二十六元、後至二十五元、蕪湖陳尖二十六元至二十五元、新尖二十五元半至二十五元、嘉興新川尖二十五元半、新羊尖二十六元半至二十六元、高團尖二十八元半、中二十七元半至二十七元、變元三十二元、全市成交五千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日繼續下降、因江北一帶來源不　　新秈亦由車輪絡繹運　　陳秈併計續有抵埠五　　十包、且內地新尖亦源源到市、貨方遂多在市貶售、以求連脫、故晨間開價以後、即見一味下遊、結果新陳各小七八角至一元許、江北新秈與京蕪陳秈均祇二十六、中次自二十五元至二十四元左右、宿次低貨則僅二十三元許、</p>
<h3>廠粉再騰</h3>
<p>回籠貨市面平定　管店麥十元六角</p>
<p>現粉廠盤、又漲二角、已到七元一角現鈔、而各廠尙在看好、不肯多量供給、惟昨日回籠貨市面反見平常、仍在七元三四角、蓋客銷雖稱聯蟬、而本紛需要、並不十分濃厚、故回籠貨漲勢已退、且有散戶吐出、統市成交約計五萬包強、十三日運香港粉八千包、</p>
<p>小麥逐見上展、車船來源絡繹、惟貨主居奇愈甚、昨日廠方與囤戶逐有拉進、惟吃盤已較重視、結果市面比前日仍漲一二角、統市由囤戶辦去十餘車、福新與阜豐兩廠合辦一萬二三千包、管店麥最高價已達十元〇六角、十二日自北沙來麥三百五十包、</p>
<h3>糖市　惠州白見新高價</h3>
<p>較上週末漲十元許</p>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電、本市公會劃盤、復見回升、二四組白本棧現貨升一元、為六十二元三角、外棧升元半至二元、為六十二元至六十一元半、轉口五十元、太古車白B嘜升三元至二元半、初為六十八元、後退至六十七元半、OW嘜六十七元二角、OX嘜六十六元九角、DY嘜六十六元半、HX嘜六十六元三角、H嘜車赤五十元至四十八元半、荷赤無更動、本綿白升一元、振記一號六十二元、二三四號照奶、本廠一號冰升三元、為七十元、晶明冰七十一元半、</p>
<p>國產惠州白、因汕綿白軋缺、大為抬高、昨廣帮號家開出數十包、竟見七十二元之新紀錄、較之上週末漲起十元許、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新桃肉登塲</h3>
<p>首批新桃肉、茲到濟南貨拾簍、昨已見樣、色光尙佳、惟身份較軟、而個粒不大、因初次見新、頗覺稀罕、故開價竟達一百四十元、又日前所到陳毫州桃千餘件、外傳僅三十元之譜可開、顯非事實、昨已開出一部份、提桃為五十五元、普通四十元、某行意欲多進、曾還三十五六元、而號方堅持四十元云、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油轉往內地</h3>
<p>行情續升元許</p>
<p>豆油市面、港銷蟬聯、（賣則運海防轉內地）簍裝油行情續見上升元許、桶油牽連轉升、統市計開烟歧油五十件、青歧油一百件、大連油一百五十桶、神戶油一百桶、青島油八十桶、</p>
<p>生油雖由港帮辦去膠州簍裝生油一百五十件、但胃納不殷、行情仍守週末之原盤（七十元）、惟到存匱乏、下跌亦難云、</p>
<p>豆子十二日自北沙六百八十包、十三日運香港一千八百四十包、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵堅昂如故</h3>
<p>五金市面、在歐戰爆發之初、各貨狂跳不已、昨始平　、如本釘最初由二十五元、狂漲六十元、但最近開價、亦祇五十六元至八九元、較前反見軟化、貴公司馬啼鐵仍屬有漲無跌、蓋本市製罐廠玩具廠印刷廠等、需胃頗佳、執貨者心思高昂、故開價不鬆、如二百鎊美正號貨、每箱售二百二十元、一百八十磅美貨二百元、二百磅意貨一百九十元、一百八十磅意貨一百八十元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　女色帮搜辦服裝呢</h3>
<p>四馬路一帶女色服裝店、因生意漸將上市、紛紛搜辦價廉物美之各種女色呢、昨如長毛絨·短毛絨·黑灰黃子羔·企呢·螺絲呢·波蘭製造之各種大衣呢　、齊有談判成交、資本雄厚者、多整箱墊購現出、然大半多二三家品合、先付定幣限期出清者為眾、</p>

<h3>維護上海地位　美增派軍隊來滬　第六聯隊正橫渡太平洋　工部局交涉未鎭具體化　滬西越界築路一帶局勢已緩和</h3>
<p>外人方面消息、美國政府、以迭接各方報告、盛傳日本政府、將於歐戰之中、乘機攫取上海租界之管理權、九日國務卿赫爾、特在國務院召見日駐美大使堀內謙介、提出警吿、對於日本片面的改變上海地位之行動、聲明美國政府絕對不能加以容忍、措辭之堅決、一如歷决不允放棄遠東利益之聲明、在堀內訪問赫爾國務卿之後、尙不足四十八小時、美國寳島廣播無綫電臺於前晚（十一日）發出一驚人消息、謂美國海軍第六陸戰隊、已奉命向上海開拔、茲誌各情如决、</p>
<p>第六聯隊已在途中</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨（十一日）夜、據舊金山寳島無綫電臺廣播消息稱、美政府頃已決定派美海軍陸戰隊第六聯隊來滬、增强目前駐滬之美國軍力、因日人對上海公共租界增加壓力、故有此舉、第六聯隊業已乘美艦蘭格萊號在橫渡太平洋途中、來滬與駐本市之美陸戰隊第四聯隊會合、駐滬美陸戰隊第四聯隊、刻正準備兵營、以容此　增派兵云、若此說屬實、則駐滬美軍將增一倍、惟昨日深夜、據駐滬美陸戰隊第四聯隊司令部稱、彼等未聞此種行動、亦未爲第六聯隊準備兵營、</p>
<p>證之往事益覺可信</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海盛傳另有美海軍陸戰隊刻正來滬之說、而本市無綫電聽衆、聞舊金山寳島無綫電臺播音稱、第六聯隊已開來此間、乃益信其事、駐滬第四聯隊司令部、雖稱未聞此事、然第四聯隊官兵間盛傳第六聯隊奉令增援之謠諑、已非一日、按一九三年曾發生相類事件、當時駐滬美陸戰隊第四聯隊僅第一與三兩大隊、某日報載第二大隊將增派來滬、聯隊司令部當加吾認、但兩閱月後、第二大隊確已整隊開到矣、查美陸戰隊第六聯隊前會來華、一九二七年第四聯隊抵滬時、第六聯隊開往天津、第十聯隊之飛行員·坦克車兵·與砲兵·隨之前往、一九三七年，第六聯隊復來東方、附有第十聯隊之高射砲與重機關槍隊、在滬駐防數月後、一九三八年撤退、</p>
<p>雙方交涉尙未接近</p>
<p>越界築路問題、工部局前日確已與日方開始交涉、現正進行磋商、尋覓解決方案、雙方意見、一時尙未接近、外間盛傳業已解決之說、則大中社　者昨日已證明未免言之過早、所傳解決方案、將舊有越界築路警權歸之工部局、新闢之越界築路警權、歸之僞市政府」、亦祇係少數外國人之理想、關於交涉前途、記者昨日曾徵詢中外各界意見、所得結論、大都表示抱悲觀、至工部局各國董事、一時皆不願發表意見、以照工部局定章、凡行政上一切重大事件、必須經過董事會之討論通過、現悉工部局對於此事、並未對英美華各國董事提出報吿、故尙不允加以討論、</p>
<p>滬西情勢已趨和緩</p>
<p>滬西越界九日起、日僞在極司非而路愚園路及靜安寺路西段（海格路以西）一帶、佔屋佈崗後、當時形勢、甚爲緊張、居民大起恐慌、惟日來日僞方面行動、未見擴大、因此昨日滬西一帶情形、已趨緩和、茲將昨日情形、分紀如左、</p>
<p>越界築路偽警減少</p>
<p>靜安寺路七六〇號上海商業儲蓄銀行職員宿舍、已於十日被佔、鬥前所駐僞警、昨日計有六人、此外、尙有日憲兵一人、該銀行職員、仍得出人、將什物遷出、極司非而路十一號慈聯分會第三十一收容所門前、所駐之僞警、已减爲四人、與前日相同、至所內所駐之日軍僞警、時多時少、有時共有三四十人、有時僅十餘人夜間駐留所內者較少、難童中學昨日起、已恢復上課、日僞方面、並未加以干涉、極司非而路十五號狄園門口、已不見僞警、惟內部尙留數名而已、</p>
<p>限制遷居盤查行人</p>
<p>康家橋金家巷馬路橋一帶、情形仍較其他各處、稍見緊張、康家橋金司徒廟區、係偽警集中地點、共有百餘人之多、愚園路方面四明別墅及中實新村弄口、仍各駐僞警二名、與前日同、該兩弄內居民、昨起已準備遷出、但須於事前得日憲兵之許可、領得遷居證、始可不遭僞警留難、漁光村對面錢家巷口、駐有武裝僞警六人、入夜行人出入、常遭盤詢、</p>
<p>租界探捕巡邏如常</p>
<p>之租界方面之紅色警備車、昨日仍按時在越界築路各地巡邏、且增加印度馬巡隊、及機器脚踏車隊、惟車上警探、已不復有搜查行人之事，警備車雖屢屢駛過僞警駐在地點之前、但尙無衝突事件發生、惟愚園路上各大里弄之守弄請願警、已遭僞警驅逐、改由便衣僞警守望、行駛該地帶之一路九路公共汽車及廿一路無軌電車、仍照常開駛、</p>
<p>日兵行動時有越軌</p>
<p>又悉、前（十一日）晚、極司非而路十一號附近、有武裝日憲兵一人、佩指揮刀、立於道路中央、禁止行人通過、車輛仍許照常往來、但皆繞彼而行、另有日本憲兵一人乘機器脚踏車沿地豐路駛過英軍總部之前、該車未懸會、亦未標明任何可以辦認之符號、按去年方輝向工部局提供保證、凡日軍軍用車、在租界馬路行駛者、皆應懸掛鴨蛋式防軍照會但該車顯已違背該項保證、</p>
<p>局方對於繳捐態度</p>
<p>據報吿「大道政府一方面對越界築路區域居民之稅收、刻正極力規劃、謀有以奪取之道、十一日晚、引起工部局嚴重之注意、據高級職員談、「維新政府」此舉、無關工部局本身、局方並不予以注意、經據該高級職員稱、當初該項稅租交由工部局與第三者出面向居民征收則並非工部局之事、繼稱越界築路居民將租稅繳呈工部局、則工部局方面亦有應盡之義務、至於工部局工作、如居民拒絕付稅、則局方即予斷絕、其時雙方關係、亦即破裂、工部局本身、不論在中日戰事前後、對種種辦法、予以强制此謂工部局之工作、即對越界築路之地帶、闢築道路、敷置目來水鐵管、以資汲引自來水、其他如煤氣·電話·及電力等之設置是已、復稱、工部局於本年度六個月、於越界築路所收之稅收項下、亦僅五十二萬九千元、假使工部局無</p>
<p>此項收入則毋須對該區履行義務、或詢以工部局方面對越界築路地帶收取租稅、是吾感到困難、據答稱、自滬戰發生後、的確有較小困難情形之處、十一日起、由於日憲兵及「大道政府」人員逐一向該處商店實行檢查又形成嚴重緊張狀態刻下關於日方與「大道」市政檢查該區住戶一事、未能證實、據另一方面稱、檢查住戶各種細則、業已揭曉云云、復據工部局方面、不擬與日方或「大道政府」有所談判、加以討論、</p>

<h3>歐戰聲中商人投機牟利　竟然大量囤積藥品</h3>
<p>— （黃自强）</p>
<p>希望利用相等效力的國藥　希望新藥業發明普遍藥品</p>
<p>德波的戰事發動後，在第一决世界大戰時有過經騐的商人們，又欣喜地來迎接這可以發一筆橫財的機會了。且看這兩天各種物價的上漲，彷彿灌在沸水中的水銀柱一樣，高速度地飛躍着。據報上的記載：五金，顏料，呢絨等貨的存底，都很充實，而且地中海與遠東之間航運未斷，中立國的船隻也照常進口，如果能够同舟共濟，大家相互維持着一般現狀，歐洲的戰事，暫時和上海不致發生重大的影響的。但是商人們的唯利是圖，沒有看到此决歐戰和一九一四年的實際情形，也沒有意識到在危難中的中國是需要每一個人民的協力同心，共扶危局，他們是無時無刻不在尋覓發財的機會，於是，擁有貨物者，不肯輕易脫手；更大量扒進，囤積起來。他們的口號是；是舶來品都可以囤積起來。</p>
<p>最近有一位朋友染了嚴重的病症，醫生開了一種注射的藥品，連跑了四五家藥房，都回說「存貨售罄，新貨未到」。後來在一家小藥房里買到了，價格竟達戰前七倍有奇。我在驚愕之餘，和那夥計閑談了起來。據他吿訴我：西藥以德國的出品爲最多，有幾種特效藥又非德貨不辦，歐洲戰事發動後，經理的行家，都囤積起來，不肯發售了；有幾家藥房，平時進貨較多，但到這時候，也奇貨可居了。所以，現在有好幾種德國藥品，市上都沒有發售了。</p>
<p>在一切舶來品都可囤起來的口號下，竟然囤積和人類生，命有密切關係的藥品了！</p>
<p>庸醫殺人，良藥濟世，現在長袖善舞之輩，囤濟世之良藥，間接充殺人的劊子手，我們除了歎息，即咒駡的勇氣也沒有了！</p>
<p>但是，是細胞搆成的人類，誰能絕對保證不生疾病，希『孤島』人士，善自珍攝之外，至少，在沒有辦法的辦法之中，謹供一得之見：</p>
<p>現在一般醫生，都有一種習慣，藥方上不開外貨好像不够時髦。果然，誠如那小藥房中的夥計所說，有幾種特效藥，是不得不仰給於國外的，但最近新藥業發明的幾種藥品，其效力很多相等於舶來品的，所以，不是絕對　重的病癥，希望醫生們　量開用相等效力的國貨。</p>
<p>同時，許多埋頭於化騐室中的新藥業的醫師們，不要孜孜於幾稱酵母劑和醫治花柳的藥品上面，把你們硏究的精神擴大而至於各種普遍藥品。投資者更應鼓勵有所發朋的醫師</p>
<p>推而廣之，其他各業也應各就其力之所及，發揮土著的力量！</p>
<p>投機商人認爲這是發橫財的機會，但這也是提倡國貨的唯一好機會，如能以囤積的資產金來作爲開發的資，更是我們所焚香禱求的！</p>

<h3>如何解決租房糾紛</h3>
<p>— 茫茫</p>
<p>儘你用多少字也寫不了孤島上房屋的玩意兒。地主們新起的房屋要「預付房租十年」，或者在舊房產上加幾成租金，都成爲十分理直氣壯的德政。手段高妙的，還來一下什麼「翻造房子限期出屋」的把戲，用竹籬笆作爲威脅，而最後又自動的拆除，也是地主們最紳士的舉動。諸如此類的巧立名目的加租的結果，受累的不是二房東，而是一些生活都將發生恐慌的三房客。</p>
<p>日前報載：各公團要求房東勿再無故加租，這確實是公理的呼聲！自然，這問題的嚴重，早有人注意及之。記得，曾經有過房租糾紛調解會的組織，可是終因這組織不能深入各里弄，而未能發揮很大的效果。各公團的正理之呼聲，如果沒有具體辦法，根據形勢所需去加以執行，則儘怎樣大聲疾呼，而房東們也還是當作耳邊風的。</p>
<p>這在我個人的意見，房租糾紛旣是發生在一偶一角，若要由一個組織去統管上海，則因爲未能普遍開來，難免不會失敗。而最妥善的辦法，是由各公團召集有關的各方面人士（包括租界當局，地產業公會，各路聯合會等），由會議的公意，產生幾個公正的原則來，這原則將來甚至於作爲法律的根據，使一切房租糾紛都由這一原則而加以解決，否則就讓法律來公裁。</p>
<p>然而，在討論這個原則時，必要注意以下幾點：（一）在「八一三」以後加過租的不能再加；（二）加租不得超過百分之×；（三）房東必需聲明加租充分理由；（四）在幾年以內的房屋不得任意翻造；（五）二房東除自己不化錢住一個房間外，不得任意加租賺錢。</p>
<p>這個會議在原則產生後，可以解散，至多留一二幹事，以備不時之需。之後更重要的組織，則是在各里弄中組房租公議會，而由大房東二房東三房客三面組織之，一切糾紛都根據於房租調解原則去辦理，合則實行，不合則依公判。問題就容易迎刃而解。所以要在各里弄中分別成立組織的原因，是爲了就地辦理，迅速而易獲得實効。</p>
<p>這是一個嚴重的社會間題，祗有以最公正與和平的手段加以解決的。一切倔强，在大衆的公意裁判下，可能低頭的。上述的方法可以實施，至於有效果與吾？全視執行者的處理當與不當。</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　謀與醫學造士成痒　思廣村治托兒所</p>
<p>且說何家兩姊妹，見了朱愛人，正吿訴她：接到父親電報，有一位父執星期一要到上海來，要我們去見他，商量織綢廠的事。星期日是不能到自由村去了。朱愛人也吿訴她們，剛纔得到了金澹雲的結婚請帖，已定於下星期日，在上海舉行婚禮了。已經答應了她去吃喜酒的，姊妹的情分上，不能不去。朱愛人雖然醫務很忙，到那天也要撥冗去一回，好在是個星期日，也不致於妨礙她的事。她還送了老章醫師一份請帖，但老章醫師是未必去了，雖然是個星期日，可是同時未便走去兩人。後來商量到還是星期一早去呢，還是星期六下午就去？決定下來，是星期八下午就去。一則，澹雲要她們星期六就去，不知她有什麽事？二則，愛人倒也主張星期六下午就去。因爲她在上海，另行有些接洽的事。這接洽的，大部份是醫院裏的事，也是代表着老章醫師的。老章醫師是世界醫師公會的會員，而上海也有個世界醫師公會的分會。不過有許多事，老章醫師都是委託朱愛人去辦，她自己可以省力的時候，便省力了。但這個世界醫師公會，資格很嚴，非行醫十年以上，不能進這個世界醫師公會。所以像朱愛人那樣，雖然也是美國　業的醫學博士，暫時缺不能爲這個公會的會員。朱愛人也好久不到上海了，現在借著吃喜酒，也預備去料理一些事兒。其中有一件事，便是代表老章醫師，晋謁蘇理雅太太。原來蘇理雅太太和老章醫師也是老朋友，她很稱讚老章醫師的婦孺醫院與育嬰院辦得好。她知道從前一無基礎的，現在有這樣的成積，也是一片苦心孤詣了。她不但是在金澹雲面前如此說過，她在別個朋友面前，也如此說過。她曾經有過暗示，倘然老章醫師有什麽地方願意她帮忙之處，她也可以帮忙一些。她而且和金澹雲說過，有空閑的時候，要到安樂鎭來參觀參觀。蘇理雅太太是個美國資產階級中人，正宜以有餘的經濟，補東方之不足。但老章醫師一向辦這個婦孺醫院和育嬰院，經濟的來源，也頗充足，倘然辦什麽新事業，那就要別籌款項了。（一八一）</p>
<h3>私做套滙</h3>
<p>— （王蘅塘）</p>
<p>在內地的富人，逃難避入上海租界來，要想把鉅大的家產，或將銀行錢莊的存款，一概隨身帶來，那是不可能的。因爲政府在內地有禁止挾帶現鈔出境，最多每人以五百元爲限，目的在防止資金逃入淪陷區，但是狡猾的商人，常用套匯的方法，使內地的資金，源源流入淪陷區來。</p>
<p>譬如說：黃酒，絲，茶葉，綢緞，錫箔之類，出產地以紹興居多，綜計一年輸出數量，價値在一萬萬元以上，照理應有貨價寄還紹興，但是他們不這樣做，他們在上海尋好了進貨商行，要求不將此種貨款寄匯，祇須就地找個富商，由他去向銀行去提款作爲劃解。這種辦法，內地政府機關並不注意，即有查詢，此係內地商行往來，表面上似非匯款到淪陷區，更無資金逃避之嫌疑，而事實上，一轉手間，內地富人的財產，於無形之中，已匯到上海來了。至於套匯貼水，在內地付出現鈔，在上海取得現鈔，每千元的需貼費一百五六十元，損失很鉅，然而富翁不在乎此，拼命設法套匯，在上海取得了錢，可以做投機事業，如購買外匯，囤積米糧，手中有錢，就不顧他人的生活了。</p>
<p>因此套匯這種狡猾的方法，必需設法禁止，不但可以鞏固後方的金融機構，使資金從事於有利於農村，或建設之事業，而上海亦可少一批以投機爲業的富商，安定人民的生活。最好由產地當局，統制貨運，將貨價件數，核實登記，限令照數返還，不許自相接受。能如此辯理，可以使內地資金不致枯竭，是杜絕漏巵的根本辦法，遠勝於檢查行旅，限止私帶現鈔的治標政策。</p>

<p>鐵生飾秋蓮角，所歌「二簧慢板「搖板」「南梆子」三折，最堪耐人尋味。此間折節頗多，抑揚頓挫之處，一板眼，均趨嚴緊，不可放鬆，吾則稍縱即逝，一發而不可收拾，畹華之唱，其能撩人情緒者，即在於此，鐵生歌來，平坦有韻，操縱自如，緊凑有方，於收眼放腔時，無不循規蹈矩，以梅音是尙，絕不稍露荒怠，其嗓之甜，聆之誠無異飲甘露也：其不足處，爲台步輕佻，尙欠穩重，有失雍容華貴之風，當其與李春發相遇，若驚若喜含羞欲語之際，表情過於熱烈，搔首弄姿與乳母拉扯時，「搖板」正吐尾音，倉卒間遽脫三眼」，此誠正角唱戲之根本大忌，所謂謊腔脫音也；蓋旣重表情，允不可不注意唱，則「聲　並茂」，可左右觀客之心緒，俾獲良好之印象，是夕操琴者絕不放鬆，「三眼居然拉過，足微托腔之嚴，殊爲鐵生深慶得人。</p>

<h3>崑劇蘇武之裝飾</h3>
<p>— 秋生</p>
<p>頃肖傖先生在本刊所作論崑劇望鄉。」一文，自覺有數語不能不爲肖傖先生吿者，爰作斯文，編者或不以爲多事乎？</p>
<p>一，蘇武所穿之衣，照崑劇舊規，於藍褶之外，須罩一橙色忠臣衣」。此「忠臣衣」似祇有崑劇有之，平劇中未之見也。形似馬甲，惟肩部稍闊，幾及於上膊，極類今摩登女子所穿之一種夏季大衣，惟以橙色平緞製之耳。不佞以前曾數觀倪傳鉞演斯劇，均穿此衣。不知肖傖先生所見此次鄭傳鑑之搬演，有無穿此衣。意者年來行頭不齊，竟付闕如，亦未可知。然破壞成規，不足訓矣。又此忠臣衣崑劇中穿者亦祗三人，一爲浣紗記范蠡（小生飾）在「養馬」齣中穿之，示彼正在石室中遭受「國難」。其二爲嗚鳳記斬楊齣中之楊繼盛，忠愍公之殉國，誠千古至忠之事。其三即牧羊記之蘇武也。</p>
<p>二，蘇武手中所持之節，肖傖先生謂崑劇中僅垂鬚頭一，而皮黃中則較多。殊不知崑劇中亦有一定之章則也。案牧羊記乃元人所著之南戲，全本久軼，今僅有伶人之傳鈔木耳。各曲選曲譜等書所收，亦不到十齣，「蘇州小班」能演唱者計叫齣：「小逼」「牧羊」「遺妓」「望鄉」。演「小逼」時所持之節，的有鬚頭四五個，演「牧羊」時少一二個，「遺妓」再少些，至「望鄕」時祇剩一個矣。此蓋表示時間之早遲，亦有深意存焉。</p>
<p>不佞第一决看此四齣時，猶在「新樂府」時代。憶演「小逼」者爲鄭傳鑑，演「牧羊」「遺妓」者爲施傳鎮，末齣「望鄕」則由倪傳鉞演之。四齣連貫演出，飾蘇武者更易三人，而嗓子則愈後愈響，使覜者愈觀而愈興奮。猶憶當時配飾李陵者爲趙傳珺，衛律者爲周傳錚，「牧羊」齣中蘇武夢中所見之「師父」爲包傳鐸，餘俱不復能省憶。後「望鄕」看過多决，「小逼」較少，而「牧羊」「遺妓」則僅此一次耳。今也，傳鎭物化，傳鉞遠行，欲更連觀此四劇，已不可能矣，思之曷勝感慨。</p>
<h3>劇藝社重演「夜上海」</h3>
<p>第一部以孤島生活爲題材的劇本—「夜上海」，自上月間由上海劇藝社在「璇宮劇院」演出以來，因爲劇本主題的現實，演出的努力，深得各界好評，文藝界曾一致譽爲「上海二年來的詩史」，惟當時演期僅一星期，致有多數觀衆未及一睹，最近劇藝社當局收到無數催促重演的信件，故決將原定上演之「撒謊世界」挪後，已先將「夜上海」重演一星（自十日起），以應觀　要求</p>
<p>這次重演的陣容和上次一樣，並沒更動，所成問題的就是藍蘭了；依照報上的廣吿，藍蘭担任「辣斐」「日出」中的「翠喜」，「日出」是九號開始演，而十號「夜上海」就要開始，事實上有了衝突，不過「辣斐」的翠喜，是藍蘭Ａ，白燕Ｂ的，那末，或許沒有問題。</p>
<p>「夜上海」中的老頭子梅嶺春，本來是王即絮演的，在上决演時，王即絮因爲過份興奮，演了兩天就病倒下來，後來由蘇丹代的，這决王即絮病愈，愛重新上塲云。</p>

<h3>German Clearing Operations Near Warsaw 　Polish Army Defends River, Front Line Gradually Stabilizing　German Army Changes Strategy, Focusing on Northeast, Including Operations Like Fortresses　Major Battle Points in Central Region Are Historical Fortresses</h3>
<p>Paris – According to news received here from Poland, it is understood that Polish troops have been able to contain the German advance on all fronts, with the total front line reduced from 1,300 kilometers to 700 kilometers. The German motorized units have not yet entered Warsaw, and due to fierce Polish resistance, they have had to withdraw from the outskirts of Warsaw. This fact has also been acknowledged by various German radio stations. As for the German troops in East Prussia, who originally planned to cross the Bug River and assist in the attack on Warsaw, they have now had to change their direction to the Suwałki area in the north due to strong Polish resistance. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Beijing – According to reports received here, the people of Warsaw are defending the city day and night. The resistance of the Polish army is becoming increasingly well-organized. It is reported that the German advance in several areas has indeed been contained. The German troops advancing from East Prussia have not made much progress beyond the positions they occupied five days ago, and they have not been able to attack Warsaw from the west. It is reported that they are now planning to change their strategy and attack from the east. However, according to Polish military authorities, this move by the German army creates a very narrow salient, which is in danger of being cut off near Białystok and Grodno. The Polish side claims that the German troops advancing from Slovakia have ventured too deep and have been driven back by the defending forces. The defending forces have repeatedly achieved local victories. The Polish command in the Corridor area also reports that cavalry is still resisting German troops in favorable terrain. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to the German News Agency, German troops advancing from the north have met with no resistance and are now approaching the Vistula River. The Modlin Fortress, built by Napoleon, is now within range of German artillery fire. The fortress is located on the right bank of the Vistula River, at the confluence of the Vistula, Bug, and Narew rivers, 20 miles northwest of Warsaw. In 1915, the Russian army defended Warsaw with the Narew River against Hindenburg's forces. The radio station also announced that German troops are now driving into the Polish industrial city of Łódź, which is located 82 miles southwest of Warsaw. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – The Commander-in-Chief has just issued a battle report stating that the situation near Suwałki in the north has not changed. At Łomża on the Narew River, enemy troops are launching fierce attacks with motorized units, and our troops are engaged in fierce fighting. The situation at Modlin in the central region has not changed. After heroic resistance, the defending forces have repelled the enemy troops near Warsaw. The fighting near Kutno and along the Bzura River is quite intense. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>London – According to the German official news agency, German troops have captured the town of Łomża on the Narew River in northern Poland. However, the Polish General Staff denies this, stating only that fierce fighting is still taking place near the town. The Łomża Fortress, located 80 miles northeast of Warsaw, was occupied by German troops in 1915 and later returned to Poland. It has a population of 32,000. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Since the capture of the Łomża Fortress on the Narew River, the strong defense line built by Poland on that river, based on the former fortresses of Imperial Russia, has fallen into German hands. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin – This morning, the German military headquarters issued a battle report stating that the main battle between German and Polish forces west of the Vistula River is nearing its end. Southern troops are preparing to cross the Bzura River. German troops north of the Vistula River are still advancing towards the Modlin Fortress. Enemy troops northeast of Warsaw have been defeated after fierce fighting. Most of the German troops have crossed the railway from Warsaw to Białystok, pursuing the enemy troops. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to German war reports, German and Polish forces will engage in their first major decisive battle today in a 250-mile zone in the center of Poland. The decisive point will be in the Łódź area, a semicircular front line northeast to southeast of Warsaw. Polish troops in Warsaw, the Vistula River, the Bug River, and the Łódź area have all occupied important locations and are preparing for action. German progress has been slower in the past 48 hours, but the fighting has been the fiercest since the start of the war. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops　Concentrate on Western Border　To Prevent Polish Troops from Retreating　Romania Also Increases Troops on Soviet Border</h3>
<p>Lithuanian Capital – According to Moscow reports, the Soviet Union has implemented a partial mobilization as a precautionary measure against Polish troops retreating to the Soviet border. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet official newspaper "Pravda" stated today that the concentration of Soviet troops on the western border is to prevent Polish troops from retreating into the Soviet Union. If Polish troops do retreat into Soviet territory, Soviet troops will disarm them first. The newspaper also stated that Poland has been effectively defeated, and its military and economic centers have fallen. Poland's own "disorganized army and lack of strong fortifications are insufficient to resist the German army, and its allies have not provided sufficient assistance." The tense situation in Moscow has now passed, and public morale has stabilized somewhat.</p>
<p>Moscow – The reserve troop mobilization is almost complete, so people here are not as panicked as before. However, many people are still gathering outside banks, continuing to withdraw deposits to buy food and jewelry. There are fewer vehicles on the streets because many cars have been requisitioned by the army. Theaters and cinemas have very few visitors. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital – Romanian troops began concentrating on the Soviet border today. It is reported that there were no special precautions taken by the Soviet Union on the Dniester River, but recently the Soviet Union has also been building defensive works there, so Romania cannot help but take precautionary measures. In short, Romania's defensive works are entirely in the hands of the French Southern Army and Western Army. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Germany Strictly　Limits Consumption</h3>
<p>Paris – News has just been received here from neutral countries stating that Germany has introduced new measures to limit consumption. Gasoline consumption will be strictly limited from the 20th of this month, with all vehicles except those used by government agencies prohibited from operating. Restaurants are not allowed to serve meat on Mondays and Fridays. Yesterday, being a Monday, the menu of a large hotel in Berlin offered nothing but cabbage rice porridge and apple pie, but the meal price was not reduced. As for the transportation industry, only waterways are available for transporting goods from mainland Germany to East Prussia. According to the Rotterdam newspaper in the Netherlands, German hotels will have to reduce their daily purchases of fats and butter by 40% and white sugar by 25% to 40% from the first of next month. This measure is intended to restrict people who have reduced their food purchases from switching to eating in restaurants. In addition, the German government issued an order on the 9th of this month restricting the use of various metals in the construction industry. When Air Minister Goering recently gave a speech to a munitions factory, he only mentioned the supply of iron and did not discuss the supply and demand of other metals, indicating that the German authorities have had to restrict the consumption of various metals. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland – News has just been received here from Berlin stating that half of all elementary schools in Germany have been converted into hospitals. All universities except for five in Berlin, Vienna, Munich, Leipzig, and Jena have been closed. (Havas, 11th) Since the battle for Warsaw began last Friday night and fell into initial disarray, the general form of events can now be assessed, As Poland is a large open plain, there is no geographical high ground which could be used for defence, The Vistula, Narew and Bug rivers are its main strategic advantages for its defence. At the point where the three rivers meet Napoleon had built the Modlin Fortress, which along with the Narew River Łomża Fortress and Warsaw itself create a hornworks defensive structure, Regarding the German advance, it is being made along five routes, if one sees Warsaw as the centre, according to German war reports, the southern route has entered Łódź, the western route has arrived at Kutno, the north-western route is directly attacking Modlin, the northern route has already taken Łomża, although that has not been confirmed, and the north-eastern route has Białystok as its goal, implementing an encirclement operation. Besides that, the German and Polish armies are currently engaged in a major decisive battle,</p>
<h3>Turkish Policy　Avoid Involvement in Vortex　Maintain Friendly Relations with Belligerents　Military Measures Purely Precautionary</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital – Prime Minister Saydam recently delivered a speech to the National Assembly, explaining Turkey's position, stating briefly that "our country maintains normal relations with all belligerent countries, in accordance with international law. Our country has no direct political differences with Germany, our relations with Poland have always been friendly, and our relations with the Soviet Union remain amicable. As for our relations with Britain and France, our interests are aligned and our views are consistent on certain definite foundations, and we have negotiated a mutual assistance agreement in the most friendly environment. We hope that the current war will not expand its scope and draw our country into the vortex. The military measures taken by the government recently are purely precautionary." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome – After Turkish Prime Minister Saydam explained his country's foreign policy to the National Assembly yesterday, people here generally felt a great deal of interest and said that there were three noteworthy points: (1) The entire speech did not mention the word "neutrality." (2) The country has adopted a strategic position. (3) The country's attitude may change depending on the development of the situation. In addition, the country continues to adhere to the spirit on which the Balkan Entente is based and respects the commitments made to Romania that are accepted by all countries. For this reason, political figures here hope that it can exert a positive influence on the Soviet government. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Developments　British Ambassador Meets Italian Foreign Minister　French Ambassador to Spain Returns to Post</h3>
<p>Rome – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with British Ambassador Loraine last night at the Palazzo Chigi for 45 minutes. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to today's Italian official gazette, Foreign Minister Ciano met with German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen for a lengthy discussion. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>

(Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Bombing Policy　Polish Hatred Deepens</h3>
<p>Finnish Capital – A Latvian journalist who recently returned from Warsaw stated that the German aerial bombing strategy employed on the Polish rear has provoked great hatred towards Germany. The road he traveled was filled with the tragic sight of villages and towns burned and people displaced. As far as the eye could see, thick smoke rose, indicating that towns had been reduced to ashes. The destruction caused by German incendiary bombs was terrifying. Residents are now taking refuge in the forests, and the country roads are littered with corpses. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – German planes bombed the town of Mokotów as many as seventeen times yesterday and five times today. As of noon, two German bombers had been shot down by Polish anti-aircraft guns. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Lublin, Poland – The town of Luck was bombed by German planes four times today, and the city of Lublin was also hit by multiple bombs, causing considerable damage. Brest-Litovsk, Kowel, Chełm, and Siedlce were also bombed. German planes also attacked trains carrying refugees. Many of the enemy pilots captured are young men under the age of seventeen. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>London – The Ministry of Information has just released a statement stating that Mrs. Shelley, the wife of British Embassy official stationed in Warsaw, was killed in the German bombing of Warsaw yesterday. Other embassy staff were unharmed and have now left Warsaw. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Mistakenly Believing Warsaw Had Fallen, False Report　Several German Officers Drove to the Outskirts and Were Captured</h3>
<p>Warsaw – German radio stations have issued false reports stating that Warsaw has already fallen. Several German officers, believing it to be true, drove to the outskirts of Warsaw and have been captured by the Polish defenders. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Map of Warsaw's Situation</h3>
<p>Since the battle for Warsaw began last Friday night and fell into initial disarray, the general form of events can now be assessed. As Poland is a large open plain, there is no geographical high ground which could be used for defence. The Vistula, Narew and Bug rivers are its main strategic advantages for its defence. At the point where the three rivers meet Napoleon had built the Modlin Fortress, which along with the Narew River Łomża Fortress and Warsaw itself create a hornworks defensive structure.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sorting and Promoting Common International Beliefs</h3>
<p>Political scholars of the modern era must understand that the establishment of a national system is based on the beliefs of its constituent members. When a nation supports republicanism, it becomes a republic; when it respects the rule of law, the constitution becomes a norm; when subjects love and support the monarch, it becomes a kingdom or a dictatorship; when several states need and complement each other, it becomes a federation or a confederation. Are these just empty theories of scholars and pedantic talk of Confucian scholars? The ultimate truth that cannot be overturned exists, becoming an iron rule for managing the world. Applying this to international affairs, I believe it is also true.</p>
<p>In recent years, the world has deeply sighed at the dimming of international justice, the reversal of civilization, and the gradual emergence of a state of anarchy; however, it has only sighed and has not tried to uphold it. The world also deeply hates violent aggression; however, it has only deeply hated it and has not resolved to completely eliminate it. Judging from the atmosphere of recent years, although it is said that contradictions are intricate, crises are everywhere, it is almost difficult to believe that there would be a war like this today. Even if there is a war, it would only be like the war between China and Japan; Poland, instead of submitting like Czechoslovakia and Austria, would probably only be like Abyssinia and Albania, exhausting its own efforts and fighting Germany alone. Who would have known that Britain and France would rise up with arms and come to its aid? This is a judgment that we would not have dared to make even half a month ago, and it is also something that German leader Hitler was astonished and horrified by. Not only that, but the Soviet Union's abandonment of Britain and France to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany, and the dissolution of the Hiranuma Cabinet in Japan, with the prime minister's selection falling to Abe, may also have been based on the assumption that Germany and Poland might have problems and Britain and France would have no intention of fighting. Was this one of the hypothetical premises for the Soviet Union and Japan? This is something that we cannot help but imagine after the rise of Britain and France. Why? What Britain and France have shown in recent years is that they have sighed and deeply hated, but they have not shown that they love justice, love civilization, and love the international order as much as they love everything in their own country; we have this view, and the Soviet Union, Japan, and even Germany probably have the same view.</p>
<p>Now that Britain and France have declared war on Germany for ten days, in these ten days, the reasons why Britain and France have declared their significance of warfare have been like a string of beads. Take Britain as an example: there is the edict of King George VI, the broadcast speech of Prime Minister Chamberlain, the parliamentary speech of Foreign Secretary Halifax, the article of the new Naval Minister Churchill, the broadcast speech of the new Minister of Overseas Dominions Eden, and the British government's note to the League of Nations, which cannot be listed exhaustively. The main points are summarized as four points: (1) We are not fighting for a dispute over a distant city (the Free City of Danzig), we do not hate the German people, and we do not intend to destroy Germany; (2) We are fulfilling our obligations to Poland; (3) We oppose violent aggression, punish betrayal, uphold justice, guarantee freedom, restore international order, and establish lasting peace; (4) As long as National Socialism exists, the civilized world cannot be realized, so we must strive for complete victory and never give up halfway. Every speech is full of generosity and righteousness. After listening from afar, we not only understand the significance of Britain and France going to war and deeply believe in the ambitions and beliefs of Britain and France in this way; but also estimate that this decision to go to war must have supreme value for human civilization and international welfare; in fact, Britain and France can win, and in principle, Britain and France should win.</p>
<p>However, I still feel that there is something lacking. The reason is that what Britain and France have shown in recent years has not been as strict and righteous as the words after the declaration of war; moreover, before and after the declaration of war, they often blamed Germany for failing to accept peace negotiations. Let's consider this: if the declaration of war is absolutely strict and righteous, how can it be carried out in negotiations? Then what is the purpose of proposing negotiations on the eve of the declaration of war? Is it to use negotiations to make Germany abandon its National Socialism, which threatens world civilization? If negotiations are held, how will it resolve the various sincere ambitions and beliefs? Therefore, although we sympathize with and trust Britain and France today, the central consciousness of Britain and France is divided into several fragments between the past and the present; the actual actions of Britain and France are also divided into several paragraphs in the recent short period; after twists and turns, and reorganization, it is like today, which is what those who deeply love Britain and France cannot hide for Britain and France. Because there is something that cannot be hidden like this, it has not been able to gain the most universal response in the international community. For example, in the United States: the current neutrality law, which is unfavorable to Britain and France, needs to be amended; and yesterday's telegram said that it is still not possible to immediately convene a special session of Congress; this is because Senator Borah, who speaks out against it, may be limited by party strife, or suffer from short-sightedness, or stubbornly hold onto the prejudices of isolationism, or be contaminated by the propaganda of other countries, and therefore the various sincere ambitions and beliefs of Britain and France are not enough to make him respond, which is not to be discussed; even wise men like President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, since Britain and France declared war on Germany, have not made any strong statements other than declaring the neutrality of the United States; is this because the "sense of justice" of the President and Secretary of State is insufficient?</p>
<p>Everything that is not accomplished without time, such as the ripening of a melon and the completion of a canal when water flows, is natural, but for it to ripen and for it to arrive, time is necessary, and it cannot be obtained in an instant even with the power of a thunderbolt. From this, we know that the thorough implementation of Britain and France's beliefs and the response to the international community all depend on a considerable amount of time after the establishment of their central consciousness; the ten days since the declaration of war are only the beginning of establishing a central consciousness. After it has begun, it must be held firm and carried out with more difficulty, and it must prove the strictness of its attitude and the firmness of its beliefs; what is true today is also true in the future, what is true for Germany is also true in Europe, and by extension, what is true for the Far East and the Pacific is no different, then it will eventually universally respond to the international community, which can be asserted. If the international community forms a common belief in this, then it can also be asserted that justice, civilization, and order will be established. The past pathology of the international community lies in knowing what to sigh at but not striving for it, and knowing what to hate deeply but not eliminating it completely; Britain and France also suffered from this pathology before declaring war on Germany; and as of now, the various countries other than China and Britain and France are still groaning like Britain and France did ten days ago. The governments and people of all countries can abide by the law and love their country and be loyal to their monarch, so the system of their country is clear and bright; and the clarity and brightness of the international community depends on the establishment of a common belief by all countries; is the war in Britain and France the beginning of the expansion and greatness of the common international belief?</p>
<h3>The Western Front Remains Quiet Yesterday, British Vanguard Troops Arrive in France, Air Force Units Also Arrive, French Residents Express Great Welcome</h3>
<p>London, This afternoon, the Information Department made its first official announcement that British troops have landed in France. The announcement stated that the British troops are not yet engaged in combat, and no further details are available at this time. According to news from Paris, France has made full preparations to receive the British troops based on the experience gained during the last Great War. Barracks in various bases have been built, and a large supply of provisions has been prepared for the continuous arrival of British troops. Ammunition depots have been quickly constructed, and hospitals are ready. British troops are now moving to various locations within France aboard freight cars marked "Capacity: 40 men, 8 horses." French girls often cheer the soldiers in the cars as the train passes through quiet villages, while the able-bodied men of the villages have already joined the army. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris, The movements of British land and air forces in France are still kept strictly secret. The general public only knows that British troops have arrived here. However, in the past few days, British sources here have learned that a large number of British air personnel, supported by the latest aircraft, are now stationed in France. It is also reported that British troops have landed in France. According to news from various villages and towns, residents are expressing great welcome to the British troops. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<p>London, After the arrival of British troops in France, the "London Evening Standard" commented: "The troops of our country fighting alongside the French troops are only the vanguard. However, our people are determined to eliminate the semi-mad and utterly untrustworthy Hitler and his treacherous National Socialism, and we must make great efforts. We should neither act hastily nor be careless. If needed in the future, these tens of thousands of soldiers can easily become millions, and these divisions can easily become several corps, until Hitler and his rogue government are overthrown and peace is restored in Europe." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris, The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 16, stating: "Despite fierce resistance from the enemy, our troops continue to advance. The battle line has now been extended twenty kilometers east of Saaralbe. Our troops have made significant progress." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris, According to observers here, the German forces on the Western Front, fearing that they might be forced to retreat into the Siegfried Line's concrete and steel defenses, have taken the offensive in the Sierck area near the Luxembourg border to alleviate this danger and to maintain forward outposts such as artillery positions and observation posts as long as possible. The German General Staff knows that it will soon be forced to deal with a true French offensive, so it is now planning a counter-offensive to delay the French advance, allowing the German forces to arrange everything in the fortified bunkers. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris, The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 17, stating: "The entire front was quiet last night." Semi-official sources added, in the same manner as yesterday, that for the past three days, our troops have made progress in the Saar region of Germany and have consolidated the occupied positions. Although our troops have advanced smoothly on a vast front, large-scale combat has not yet begun. As things stand, our troops have achieved the most notable results east of Saarbrücken (a major industrial area). The German Siegfried Line is located ten kilometers north of this city. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris, Renowned journalist Maurice recently commented on the situation of the Franco-German war in the "Petit Parisien," stating: "The German side attempted to launch an offensive on the French border along the Moselle River on the 10th of this month, advancing several hundred meters, but due to a counter-attack by arriving French reinforcements, it failed to make significant progress. Currently, French troops are continuing to attack in other areas, with particular emphasis on the area north of Saarguemines, between the Saar River and its tributary, the Blies River. At the same time, pressure is being intensified on Saarbrücken, and the German front line may retreat behind that city in the near future." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Czech Expatriates in France Form a Foreign Legion, Their Strength Should Not Be Underestimated</h3>
<p>Paris, Czech Minister to France, Osuský, recently stated to the press that the Czech expatriate legion formed in France is not a volunteer army, but a formal force equal to the army of other countries. Although our country's territory has been occupied by a strong enemy, it is still an independent country in law. The French government recognizes the Czech foreign legion as an allied force that will fight alongside England, France, and Poland. To date, 50,000 expatriates have enlisted. Czech expatriates in England and the United States will soon come to participate. Their strength should not be underestimated. In the future, after the army is formed, it will be commanded by General Ingr, the commander of the Czech foreign legion during the last European War. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>France Implements Exchange Controls, Financial Functions of England, America, and France Maintain Close Ties</h3>
<p>Washington, After the French government implemented exchange controls, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau stated to the press that France's move was mainly to adapt to the extraordinary situation and was not intended to counter the American currency. "The spirit of the Anglo-Franco-American currency agreement naturally remains as before." England has also taken similar measures, so the current currency agreement will only continue to apply as usual between the United States and Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. However, the U.S. Treasury Department will still buy and sell gold to England, America and France, so the financial functions between the three countries remain linked and without difficulty.

<h3>Canadian Troops Permitted to Fight Abroad, $100 Million Allocated to Strengthen National Defense, Important Bills Passed by Senate and House</h3>
<p>Ottawa, The Canadian government today informed Congress that it is preparing a $100 million fund for war. Since Canada declared war on Germany yesterday, it has stepped up preparations to transport munitions and troops to Europe to participate in the fighting alongside England and France. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Ottawa, The Canadian federal government recently submitted a temporary national defense budget to the House of Commons, proposing to allocate 100 million Canadian dollars during this fiscal year (ending next March), in addition to the regular national defense budget, to strengthen national defense. Prime Minister King also announced in the House of Commons that a bill would be introduced to establish a Ministry of Munitions. In addition, the government is constantly taking measures to curb market monopolies and limit wartime profits. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Ottawa, The national defense budget has been submitted to the House of Commons for discussion. A certain congressman proposed an amendment arguing that the troops of the province should only be allowed to fight within the province or in nearby areas, intending to prevent the provincial government from sending expeditions to Europe to participate in the war. The House of Commons rejected it and passed a resolution allowing the province's troops to fight both at home and abroad. Then, the temporary national defense budget was voted on, and the Senate also approved it. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Ottawa, The "Ottawa Journal" recently reported that the Canadian federal cabinet may be reorganized into a national unity cabinet during the European war, still led by Liberal leader King as Prime Minister, and including Conservative leader Manion and leaders or representatives of other opposition parties. As things stand, the Liberal Party holds a large majority in Congress, so there is no need to reorganize the cabinet. However, it is generally believed that after the establishment of a national unity cabinet, firstly, all parties and factions in the country can unite during the war to increase strength, and secondly, the trouble of a congressional election in the autumn of this year can be avoided. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim Leader Professes Loyalty to England, Princes Express Same Sentiment</h3>
<p>London, Today, the Information Department issued a public notice stating that, in addition to urging his followers to give England unlimited support, the Indian Muslim leader Aga Khan also expressed his willingness to completely obey the command of the Indian government. Prince Lai Pussa has volunteered to have several of his young sons join the army. Similar expressions of support have been made in western India. At the first decisive meeting held by the Nidat Legislative Council after the outbreak of the war, the Indian people were notified to do their best to help England. Trade union activists in western India also expressed their loyalty to England. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<h3>France Notifies League of Nations of Declaration of War Against Germany</h3>
<p>Paris, Foreign Minister Bonnet recently sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol stating that Germany, regarding Poland, and regarding all obligations freely accepted by other signatory countries of the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, is now blatantly violating them and has inflicted aggressive actions upon Poland. As a result, the French government has had to provide assistance to Poland in accordance with the current treaties between France and Poland. Prior to this, all peace proposals made by the British and French governments were rejected by Germany. The French government was forced into this position, and therefore declared war on Germany at 5:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. I hereby report accordingly, and I hope that it will be forwarded to the governments of the member states. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Envoys to Germany and Italy Discuss Countermeasures to the European Situation, Plan to Decide on Future Plans for Axis Powers, Toshio Shiratori to Leave Italy for Home</h3>
<p>French Foreign Minister Meets with Japanese Chargé d'Affaires for Talks</p>
<p>Rome, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima arrived in Rome today to meet with Ambassador to Italy Shiratori to exchange views. (Domei, 11th)</p>

Yesterday, he conferred with Lieutenant General Oshima on the European issue. In addition, Shiratori paid a visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last Friday, with Foreign Minister Ciano also in attendance, so the importance of the conversation is self-evident. It is said that after arriving in Rome yesterday, General Oshima discussed the European situation and Far Eastern issues with Shiratori. In addition, he will discuss everything in detail with the Japanese military and economic study mission. Both Shiratori and Oshima are strong advocates of an alliance with Germany.

<h3>Japan Forces American Reporter to Leave Hailar, The Situation on the Outer Mongolian Border is Tightly Guarded by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Hailar, Colonel Sakurai, head of the Japanese special service agency here, today ordered me (an Associated Press reporter) to leave here for Changchun within thirty hours. He said that he was acting on the orders of the commander of the Kwantung Army. When I asked him why I was ordered to leave the border between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, he replied, "I should inquire with Changchun." Japanese reporters staying here have also been ordered to return to Changchun. Colonel Sakurai stated, "Journalists must stay in Changchun in order to obtain a special permit to return here. It will take at least ten days to obtain this permit." He refused to release information on the situation on the Nomonhan border over the past ten days, citing "military secrets."

<h3>Greek Crew Refuses to Transport Mexican Oil to Japan</h3>

<h3>Major Agenda Items of the Pan-American Conference</h3>
<p>Washington, According to news here today, the agenda for the Pan-American Conference to be held in Panama City is set to include discussion of the neutrality of the Americas, maintaining peace in the Western Hemisphere, maintaining the rights and obligations of neutral countries, and maintaining the sovereignty of belligerent countries in the current environment. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Retired Japanese Air Force Officer Observes the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Major General Oyama, a retired officer of the Japanese Air Force and known for his research on Chinese military books, stated in a telephone interview from Rome with the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun that in this European war, Germany has no chance of winning quickly, nor do England and France. When two tigers fight, one is sure to die, and the other is sure to be fatally wounded. It is impossible to achieve a quick victory in modern warfare. Germany's victory in Poland may be assured, and once the battle in Poland is decided, Germany will concentrate on the war in the west. It is said that Hitler has obtained detailed maps of France's Maginot Line, which will greatly assist the German forces. However, France has spent ten years building a solid defensive line west of the German border. If Germany attacks this defensive line with its elite forces and is destroyed, the Nazi dictatorship will not be able to be maintained. Regarding this, Germany has not forgotten the painful experience it suffered in Verdun during the third year of the last Great War, where more than a million German soldiers died and were then strongly attacked by the Allied forces, blunting their edge. Hitler's ability to firmly control the German people is due to the Nazi organization and the army. It is said that the army accounts for 30-40% of the total population, and the rest of the people are middle-aged and elderly, many of whom are soldiers who have suffered the pain of war. These people harbor resentment towards the leader's arbitrariness, but dare not speak out. If the German army has a strength of 4 million men, England and France must recruit about 8 million men in order to defeat the German army by a ratio of two to one. It remains a question whether England and France can mobilize this huge number of troops in a relatively short period of time. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Strongly Advocates Revising Neutrality Law, Congressional Isolationist Legislators Still Seek to Obstruct, American Factories Rush to Manufacture Military Aircraft for England and France</h3>
<p>Washington, President Roosevelt returned to Washington from Hyde Park and immediately held talks with Secretary of State Hull. According to a White House spokesperson, the President has not yet made a decision on convening a special session of Congress to revise the current Neutrality Act. Political figures expect Congress to convene in three weeks. The President had suggested to the leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties that the session of Congress should be as short as possible, but some Republican legislators expressed their opposition, saying that after Congress reconvenes, first, the issue of neutrality must be discussed with the greatest freedom, and second, Congress should not adjourn as long as there is a danger of the European war dragging the United States into the vortex. Senator Borah of the Republican Party also told the press that any action that attempts to force Congress to revise the Neutrality Act and abolish the arms embargo clause should be opposed. I do not want to discuss this point of view here, but this matter is of great importance and requires thorough research and discussion. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington, Regarding the abolition of the arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act, since the outbreak of the European war, President Roosevelt has consulted with the leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress, and the results have been very good. Once Congress holds a special session, the Senate and House of Representatives will be able to abolish this clause by a two-thirds majority vote. So far, the reason why the President has delayed convening Congress is that various concerns have not been completely dispelled. In other words, the President is deeply afraid that when Congress discusses this issue, a few isolationist legislators may revert to their old ways and obstruct it in various ways, causing the democracies of Europe to lose heart and Germany to rejoice, and therefore he is hesitant. However, since the Canadian Federation has declared war on Germany, if the current American Neutrality Act's arms embargo clause is not abolished, then even if one wants to sell arms to European democracies indirectly through Canada, it will not be possible. This situation is already unfair, and if it is allowed to drag on, the impact will endanger the neutrality of the United States and must be corrected as soon as possible. In addition, the number of people in American opinion circles who support materially assisting England and France is increasing day by day, which is another reason why the Neutrality Act must be revised quickly. However, it is not known what method the American government will use. Based on observation, it will probably submit the bill proposed by Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (this bill advocates abolishing the arms embargo clause) to the House of Representatives for discussion again. In short, President Roosevelt is in a very good position in the struggle with the isolationists, and most Republican legislators do not want to use the Neutrality Act as a tool for political struggle. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles, According to the heads of Douglas, North American, and five other aircraft manufacturers, they intend to continue manufacturing aircraft for England and France until the orders of 33 million US dollars are fulfilled. The aircraft manufacturers stated that although President Roosevelt has announced a ban on arms exports, they will continue to fulfill foreign orders. They expect the special session of Congress to amend the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act. Observers recall that the British Embassy in Washington recently requested American aircraft manufacturers not to stop manufacturing aircraft that Britain had ordered from the manufacturers before the outbreak of the European war. The British side in Washington also expects the Neutrality Act to be amended. The amendment of the Neutrality Act is strongly advocated by President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull.

<h3>Japan Plans Large-Scale Offensive, Adopts New Offensive on All Fronts, Nishio Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in China, Last-Ditch Effort to End War, Japan Tries Hard to Ease Relations with Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Chongqing, Chinese military observers here expect the Japanese army to launch a large-scale new offensive against China in October. Because war has now broken out in Europe, the powers that previously helped China are now unable to provide large-scale assistance, so they have full confidence in this final attempt to subdue China. It is widely believed that since the Japanese have now placed the Japanese forces in North China, South China, and Central China under unified command, they will be able to launch an unprecedented large-scale offensive against the Chinese army to replace the previous localized attacks. People here in China believe that Japan's appointment of Nishio as commander-in-chief of the Japanese forces in China and Lieutenant General Itagaki as chief of staff of the Japanese forces in China is a prelude to Japan's initiation of a new political and military program in China in the near future. The underlying purpose of this program is to facilitate the establishment of a "central government" under the leadership of Wang Jingwei. It is reported that personnel from the Beijing and Nanjing regimes are very opposed to Wang's plan. Japan hopes that placing the Japanese forces in China under unified command will eliminate this opposition. Nishio has served in China before and was a division commander during the Shanhaiguan Incident. In 1938, he served as commander of the Second Army under Terauchi, and was responsible for the operations in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway during the Japanese attack on Xuzhou. At that time, Itagaki served as a division commander under him. Chinese sources claim that Nishio and Itagaki were both defeated by Chinese forces in the Battle of Taierzhuang. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, The Japanese Army announced today that it has appointed several people to new positions "in order to effectively cope with the new stage of the Sino-Japanese War." Those appointed include General Nishio, Inspector General of Military Education, as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Forces in China, and former Minister of the Army Lieutenant General Itagaki as Chief of Staff of the Japanese Forces in China. It is said that this is a prelude to Sugiyama, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Forces in North China, being appointed as the Japanese Ambassador to the new "Double Tenth Regime," the new central government under Japanese tutelage in China, which is expected to be established soon. Lieutenant General Umezu, the Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo," has been appointed to concurrently serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Kwantung Army. General Ueda, who is going, has been transferred to work in the General Staff Headquarters. (Reuter, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Tsuruzo Nishio, Inspector General of Military Education, has been appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Forces in China, and Itagaki, the Minister of the Army in the Hiranuma Cabinet, has been appointed as Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters. It is said that Japan's appointment is aimed at unifying and cooperating the Japanese forces in China, so as to easily "end" the war against China. Nishio is one of the three giants of the Japanese Army and is known as the taciturn general, 58 years old. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan has indeed made every effort to ease relations with the Soviet Union. Its historical opposition, the conflicts on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, and the attitude of the Kwantung Army are not unrelated. In order to show sincerity to the Soviet Union, Japan has stripped Ueda, the commander of the Kwantung Army, of his concurrent position as ambassador to "Manchukuo," and appointed Umezu to succeed him. According to news today, there is indeed something more shocking going on, because Ueda has not only lost his position as ambassador, but also his position as commander of the Kwantung Army will be succeeded by Umezu. Only after Umezu becomes the dictator of "Manchukuo" can he forcibly eliminate the border conflicts. It is said that Umezu has always advocated that, during the war against China, the Soviet Union must be appeased at all costs. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Shan State Publicize Loyalty to Motherland</h3>
<p>Kunming, The Yishi Daily reported that after the anti-Chinese movement began in Shan State (Siam), a large number of overseas Chinese were chased back to their motherland.

<h3>More Than 30 Japanese Planes Raid Enshi</h3>
<p>Chongqing: More than 30 Japanese planes raided Enshi, Hubei, at noon on the 12th and dropped bombs. Among them, nine planes fled back immediately after dropping bombs, while the remaining twenty or more continued to fly west, spying over Wanxian and dropping absurd leaflets before also heading east. The air defense command of the occupied city issued an air raid alert but soon lifted it. (12th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A medical team is scheduled to take a specially chartered plane this morning to Luxian, a hundred miles southwest of Chongqing, to treat those injured in yesterday's Japanese air raid on the city. Although no details of the bombing of Luxian have been received, it is generally believed that the casualties are quite heavy because the county was not defended. It is reported that 36 Japanese bombers participated in the attack, and medical facilities in the county are severely inadequate. According to officials here, a squadron of Chinese fighter planes patrolling the skies over Chongqing flew south from Chongqing during the air raid to intercept the Japanese planes as they flew back from Luxian. There was a brief exchange, but neither side suffered any casualties. These Japanese planes flew to Luxian via northern Hunan and Guizhou. It is also reported that nine Japanese bombers attacked Batang and other towns in western Hubei, and Laifeng in northern Hunan was also bombed. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Saodang Bao Observes the European Situation and Predicts Important Developments</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Saodang Bao, the mouthpiece of the Chinese army, published an article today discussing the German army's sudden halt to its offensive towards Warsaw and even the possibility of a retreat from Krakow. The newspaper predicts that there will be major developments in Europe in the near future, and states that Germany may only station troops in the Polish Corridor, Danzig, and all other places that belonged to Germany before the Great War. At the same time, Germany may directly negotiate a "glorious peace" with Britain and France, or Italy may mediate. Under such circumstances, the attitude that Britain and France will adopt deserves our close attention. The newspaper reiterated that France has never formally declared war on Germany, but only notified Germany that France had no choice but to fulfill its obligations to Poland, and pointed out that Italy will maintain neutrality in the current war. The newspaper concluded by saying that there are no fierce attacks on either side of the Western Front, and that Britain, France, and Germany all seem to be deliberately refraining from bombing major cities. All of this indicates that a peace movement is not entirely impossible in the current war in Europe. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Japanese Authorities Restrict the Movement of Germans</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: The Japanese authorities have issued instructions to ships traveling between Macau and Guangzhou not to carry Germans to Guangzhou, as they will not be allowed to land upon arrival. A Reuters reporter interviewed an official at the Japanese consulate today, who said that the regulation is intended to prevent a large influx of Germans and the trouble they may cause. However, Germans who had already resided in Guangzhou before the outbreak of the European war are allowed to go to Macau and return without restriction. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Reinforcements Sent from Shanghai to Hankou</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since August 15th, the Japanese have reinforced their troops from Shanghai to Hankou with no less than 20,000 men, in order to replenish the three divisions of the Japanese army stationed in central Hubei. As a result, the Japanese army of these three divisions has been largely unable to fight in the past 20 days, and can only be transferred for rest and recuperation. Furthermore, many Japanese troops are currently concentrated in Tianmen, central Hubei, and judging from their appearance, they seem to be planning to attack Shashi.

<h3>Tianjin Bandits Rob Refugee Property</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Last night, 100 bandits suddenly attacked 2,000 refugees sheltering from the flood on the racecourse grandstand, resulting in one Chinese dead and one wounded, and three White Russians shot. First, the bandits shot and killed a Chinese policeman in the Chinese concession, and then proceeded to rob the refugees of their property, and search the pockets of the dead and wounded. However, they were eventually repelled by a White Russian unit. According to subsequent investigations, one of the three wounded White Russians had a hole in his chest, with the bullet exiting from his shoulder, while another had his shinbone broken. As for the wounded Chinese, he was a newlywed man who was shot by the bandits last night for being the first to shout about the robbery. Afterwards, the injured were brought into the British Concession for treatment by the British Volunteer Corps (note: the reporter is also a member of this corps) and the British Concession Police.

Chen Zhenqian, the puppet town head of Lujiaqiao Town, was also arrested, along with four accomplices, and all were beheaded and displayed to the public.</p>
<h3>Japanese Recruit Chinese Laborers, Concentrating in Qingdao with Unclear Intentions</h3>
<p>Wuxi News: Recently, due to the depletion of its troop sources, the Japanese army has formed the Qingdao Joint Venture Company, the Mainland Chinese Labor Company, specializing in recruiting unemployed laborers from various places to serve in the military. They have successively sent personnel to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places to set up recruitment offices. Now, they have sent Japanese man Tian Junnan and several Chinese to Wuxi to set up a recruitment office at the Dadong Hotel, specializing in recruiting tile and wood workers. It is said that they can earn 2.5 yuan per day, 4 yuan per day for foremen, and 1.5 yuan per day for small workers, with meals and lodging provided. They will receive 10 yuan as a settlement fee and concentrate in Qingdao. The purpose of the recruitment is only said to be to repair the bridges and roads destroyed between Qingdao and Jinan. Those who respond are unsure of the intentions and dare not go.</p>
<h3>Ding Zisheng, Head of the Puppet Association in Dinghai, Detained; Ding's Residence Also Burned Down</h3>
<p>Dinghai News: Ding Zisheng, head of the puppet self-government association in Dinghai, has recently fallen out of favor with the Japanese army and has been detained at the puppet garrison headquarters. His residence behind the Dongguan Temple in the city was set on fire by patriots on the night of August 28th, burning for more than two hours. The Japanese and puppet troops gathered to put out the fire before it was extinguished. More than ten buildings were burned down, causing huge losses.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Business Market Gradually Reveals Signs of Revival</h3>
<p>Yinxian News: Since the fall of Dinghai County, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to strengthen defense, has ordered the blockade of Zhenhai and sunk the old Taiping ship within the blockade line. At that time, Japanese warships gathered outside the Zhenhai port, and successively fired guns at Zhenhai, Fenghua, and Hutou, causing disturbance. Japanese planes also dropped bombs in Cixi, Fenghua, Linhai, Haimen, and other places. The situation was tense for a time. However, in recent weeks, the Japanese warships gathered off the coast of Zhejiang have set sail and left, and Japanese planes have not been seen flying over for many days.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the blockade of Zhenhai, ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have been diverted to anchor outside the Zhenhai port, and then transshipped into the port by small barges. Therefore, transportation and transshipment are time-consuming, and navigation is stagnant. The journey that used to take two days to complete now takes about a month. Recently, as many as fifteen or sixteen commercial ships from Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and other countries have been docked. The German merchant ship Dabao and barges from the Zhenhai Ferry Company are now running back and forth between the Zhenhai wharf and outside the blockade line.</p>
<p>The Ningbo commercial market suffered several frenzied bombings by Japanese planes in April and May of this year, and there was a desolate scene everywhere. However, in recent months, due to the disappearance of Japanese planes, there have been gradual signs of revival. The Dongda Street area is closed every day in the morning, and business resumes after 3:00 p.m. Residents who have taken refuge in the countryside and the suburbs are also returning in droves. When the lights come on at night, the streets become lively, and it stops around 12:00 midnight, but business is still less than before.</p>
<h3>Oslo Convention Countries Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>Brussels: The Standing Committee of the Oslo Convention countries held a meeting here yesterday, chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak. Switzerland, a non-member of the Oslo Convention, also sent observers to attend. The meeting was held in secret, and only a vague official report was issued afterwards. However, according to well-informed sources, the main topic of discussion was the British memorandum to the Belgian government, which stated Britain's determination to carry out an economic war against Germany. Therefore, Belgium's foreign trade will henceforth be limited to the amount necessary for Belgium's own consumption, and some goods have been listed as contraband. The memorandum was delivered to Belgium by a specially appointed British envoy. The Belgian government immediately responded, stating that it would discuss the memorandum with the other signatories of the Oslo Convention. Therefore, yesterday's meeting discussed in detail the impact of British measures on the Oslo countries and how the Oslo countries could help each other to cope with this situation.

<h3>Retaliate with the Same Weapons; Germany Can Resist "Starvation War"; Intensify Submarine Activities to Disrupt British Shipping; Three British Ships Sunk, Four Escape</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to the Berlin Evening News, the German government is currently drafting a list of contraband. Germany is able to resist all forms of "starvation war" and will retaliate with the same weapons. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German government will use "all means" to disrupt British shipping in retaliation for the British blockade. Semi-official sources revealed that the German government will intensify submarine activities to prevent arms and food from reaching Britain.

All of these actions are in response to the British government's actions against Germany. Mussolini may send a letter to the British and French governments through the Italian ambassadors to Britain and France. Diplomatic activity between Germany and Italy has been very active in the past few days. The Italian ambassador to Germany has been constantly exchanging views with German foreign ministry officials and will leave Berlin for East China to meet with Hitler.

<h3>Guida's Article Ridicules Britain; Economic Blockade of Germany Seen as Futile</h3>
<p>Rome: Guida, a famous journalist and mouthpiece of the Italian Prime Minister, criticized the British economic blockade of Germany in an article in the Italian Daily today, saying: "Britain not only seeks to isolate Germany spiritually and economically, but also hopes that the German people will rise up and openly rebel against Hitler and the Nazi Party. In Britain's view, this is the least possible outcome. However, they do not know that Germany under the Nazi Party is a unified and disciplined country, deeply imbued with nationalism, and therefore able to engage in Eastern Europe. As for Britain's plan for a three-year economic blockade of Germany, it is purely a fantasy, because Germany's economy can support itself for at least six years. For the past few years, Germany has been seeking economic self-sufficiency and has achieved remarkable results. Furthermore, Germany today is not as isolated as it was in 1914. Germany's recent agreement with the Soviet Union has allowed Germany to enjoy the resources of the Soviet Union. Germany's recent invasion of Poland was nothing more than seeking to connect with Soviet territory, so as to have direct communication with the Soviet Union. Thirdly, the German-occupied areas of Poland are not only rich in raw materials, but also in factories. Therefore, in Guida's view, if Britain and France fight with Germany, it will be a protracted war, and it will not be a win-win situation." (12th Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Eden's Speech: Strike Down National Socialism, Saying Britain is Prepared for a Long War to Create a New World Civilization</h3>
<p>London – Dominion Secretary Eden recently delivered a broadcast speech to the United States and the various territories of the British Empire, stating, "Our country is determined to go to war and will never give up halfway. We have no conflict with the German people, but unless National Socialism and its advocated oppression, violence, and betrayal are eradicated from the world, there is no hope of establishing lasting peace. On this point, our will is firm, and there is no room for compromise. Prime Minister Chamberlain once said that our country is not fighting for a distant foreign city's dispute, but to prove that aggressive actions are not profitable. This meaning should be made clear to the leaders of the German National Socialist Party and should be understood by the German people. Their National Socialist government deceives the people, telling them that if Germany can quickly defeat Poland, the democratic countries of Western Europe will sit idly by or even surrender. This is absolutely not true. Our people are already prepared for a long war to ensure that National Socialism can no longer stand in the world. This goal cannot be achieved in a day, and we must fight to the end. This is what the German people should know. Some say that before the outbreak of the European war, if Britain had declared its position earlier, peace could have been maintained. However, before the war, our country had made its attitude clear to the German authorities. In Germany, neither the current government nor future governments should accuse our country of being ambiguous in its attitude. We have tried in every way to persuade Chancellor Hitler to conduct negotiations peacefully. The Polish government has also reluctantly agreed in principle to conduct negotiations. However, Chancellor Hitler insisted on his own views, making negotiations impossible and brazenly engaging in aggression, triggering the war. Britain and France had no choice but to fulfill their mutual assistance obligations to Poland. This obligation was long ago made public to the world by Britain and France. Chancellor Hitler also accused Poland of rejecting Germany's peace proposals. In fact, Poland knew nothing about the so-called proposals. International deception has never been so extreme. Looking back at history, in the past eighty years, the German authorities have used extremely minor incidents as excuses to engage in aggression no fewer than five times. If the current German government can be honest and sincere, it should take these historical facts as a warning and engage in negotiations with countries that are willing to coexist peacefully with Germany and discuss all issues peacefully. Why not do this, but instead continue on the path of hardship, bloodshed, turmoil, and greed? How can this not be painful? As for us, our conscience is clear. Moreover, recalling the lessons of the past, our will is even more firm. We should resolutely go to war without looking back. In short, all political systems based on force cannot last long. National Socialism will also hardly escape the general rule. This war will inevitably lead to widespread devastation in vast areas, and the people of various countries will suffer great pain. However, the main question remains how to make a good aftermath. Can Europe eliminate class barriers and resolve prejudices arising from differences in doctrine? Regarding the divisions of territories, the differences in beliefs, and the barriers of language, and the commercial interests, which were the reasons for the separation of countries in the past, can they be transformed to unite countries with each other? Can the concepts of freedom, tolerance, and benevolence prevail in Europe? All of these cannot be realized as long as National Socialism exists. A new world civilization must be created through a war stage due to Hitler's decision. This is indeed contrary to our wish, but there is still a certain force in the universe that is greater than human power and cannot be resisted. Therefore, no matter what, a new civilization will eventually be created successfully, and at that time, all mankind can hope to have a good opportunity to enjoy freedom," he said.

<h3>Britain Expresses Optimism About the War Against Poland; Göring's Peaceful Atmosphere Unwilling to Consider</h3>
<p>London – Well-informed sources here, based on information from various sources, have made a definition of Germany's political stance, saying that the country will put forward peace proposals after the capture of Warsaw. In fact, there is absolutely no need to carry out this plan, because neither the British nor the French government is willing to consider this solution, and the Polish government has clearly declared its determination to fight to the end. As for the situation of the war in Poland, after the German army penetrated deep, its rear transportation is particularly vulnerable. It is currently busy reinforcing the salient positions around Warsaw, which are still in the hands of the Polish army. It is expected that the troops stationed there will automatically withdraw to avoid suffering heavy losses and will establish contact with the main force holding the banks of the Vistula River. If so, then when the German army launches another offensive in a few days, the Polish army will not be difficult to resist. In addition, the saying that Poland is receiving necessary supplies from abroad has been confirmed. Although part of the "strategic triangle" of the Polish military supply center has fallen, most of it has not been occupied by the German army. The Polish military delegation is also in close contact with the British authorities in London and can find ways to make the British and Polish governments maintain greater contact on the eastern front. All these are favorable factors for Poland. (Havas News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>London – The Ministry of Information recently issued a communique stating, "After German Aviation Minister Göring delivered a speech yesterday, officials here generally believe that German policy has been declared bankrupt. This can be seen from this. Hitler has repeatedly offered promises to other countries, but none have been fulfilled. Therefore, no matter what guarantees he offers, they will not be believed by the world. Britain's insistence that when it makes peace with Germany in the future, it must be with a German government that adheres to its word has ample reason. Not only that, the current German government does not hesitate to deceive the people, telling them that it will be able to achieve 'peace and honor.' In fact, the German government has deliberately pursued a policy of violence, making war inevitable. What peace can there be? The German government's slander of Poland is completely fabricated, which is known to the world. What honor can there be? As Prime Minister Chamberlain himself said, the techniques used by the German authorities are 'revolting.' None of the countries in Europe do not see the policies pursued by the current German government as damaging to that country's honor and endangering the security and independence of all countries. Britain's determination to fight is to restore justice in international relations. No country can be safe until this goal is achieved. The German authorities can claim that they have no ambitions in the West, but the world is already familiar with the country's statements that it has no territorial ambitions and can no longer arouse the slightest confidence. As for Göring's claim that Britain wants to impose a second Treaty of Versailles on Germany and that Britain intends to cause Germany to collapse, we have absolutely no such intention. What we seek is to establish a fair and lasting peace with an honorable German government. As for the economic situation, the German people had already tightened their belts and suffered greatly before the outbreak of the war. Now, hearing Göring's words, they may not be able to gain much comfort. The German people are very aware of the country's economic difficulties. Even Göring himself, although holding an optimistic view, does not deny that the difficulty is that the country's government is actually engaging in unnecessary war under such a serious economic situation. What else can be said?" (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>The Hague – The People's Daily here recently commented on the speech given by German Aviation Minister General Göring to workers at a munitions factory yesterday, saying that Germany lacks various resources and therefore fears British propaganda. Göring's speech has awakened German public opinion and initially recognized that "this war will be extremely difficult and will last for a long time." Not only that, the fact that British aircraft have repeatedly flown to Germany and dropped leaflets has caused the leaders of the National Socialist Party to be wary. This can be seen from Göring's speech. General Göring spent fifteen minutes repeatedly explaining the uselessness of British propaganda, which is enough to reflect his inner distress. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the German-Polish war situation, observers here all say that the Polish army's resistance is very optimistic. The Polish army has suffered few losses after responding to the war, and there is no shortage of military supplies. Therefore, due to these reasons, the German army originally hoped to defeat the Polish army in a few weeks, but it can no longer think of it this way. In addition, after the French army launched an offensive, the German authorities have begun to worry. Furthermore, due to the economic blockade implemented by Britain and France, German commercial shipping, except for a corner of the Baltic Sea, has almost completely disappeared in other parts of the world. If the Polish army only needs to resist strongly until this winter, the impact of the blockade on Germany will become more and more serious, and its position will inevitably become more and more difficult, which can be predicted.

<h3>Slovak Troops Mutiny, Unwilling to Fight Against Poland</h3>
<p>Bratislava – Since the outbreak of the European war, conflicts between the Germanic and Slovak residents of Slovakia have repeatedly occurred and have become increasingly serious in recent days. From this, it can be seen that the foreign territories "conquered" and annexed by Germany are not only useless during wartime, but also harmful. On the 4th of this month, a regiment of Slovak soldiers was sent to the Polish border. It was discovered that the officers and soldiers of the regiment mutinied because they were unwilling to fight against Poland. They had to be disarmed, escorted back to this city, and detained. Until the 10th of this month, residents of Raszysdorf Town near this city marched in front of the German authorities, shouting, "We have absolutely no reason to fight for the Germans and their leader." At that time, Germans and Slovaks clashed, and the German army intervened, arresting many Slovaks. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Jiangyin Puppet Magistrate He Peixuan Resigns; Japanese Captain Transferred to North China; Double-Packing Case of the Puppet Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The Japanese army occupies Jiangyin, regarding it as a naval port. Only the towns and villages within the city and along the Chengxi Road are controlled by them. The southeastern villages and the towns west of the county are still under Chinese control. Recently, the Japanese military special team believed that the puppet magistrate He Peixuan was too incompetent and, moreover, since taking office, had brought all his children to work in the puppet county government, receiving salaries, totaling more than two thousand yuan per month. Therefore, they were greatly dissatisfied. After hearing this, He felt ashamed. On the 6th, he secretly went to Suzhou and stayed at the New Suzhou Hotel. On the 7th, he strongly asked the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs, Pan Zhenxiao, to resign. Pan, seeing that there was no one to succeed him, temporarily comforted him. He only returned to Cheng yesterday.</p>
<p>Miyake of the Japanese army was transferred to Cheng last year to serve as the garrison captain, residing in the residence of Wu Tinglu in Delin Lane, East Street. It has been nine months now. Recently, Miyake was ordered to transfer to North China. Zhishiye was appointed as the new captain. Miyake left Cheng at 8:00 AM on the 8th. In the afternoon, Zhishiye's troops were transferred here and still stationed in Wu's residence. Moreover, because there are not many Japanese troops, Liang Xichu of the Third Detachment of the Wuxi Puppet Pacification Army was also transferred to Jiangyin. The puppet's plan to extort is all-encompassing. Since the establishment of the puppet "Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau," Jiangyin has actually become a laughing stock due to a double-packing case. It was found that the puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office Changxi District Jiangyin Collection Office" was established first to collect taxes. Later, the puppet "Jiangsu Province Xichangcheng District Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Jiangyin Collection Office" was also established to collect taxes. One person named Zhu Qing and another named Chen Yi competed with each other based on the order of establishment, each sending staff to merchants to urge payment of taxes, so that the few and far between tobacco and wine shops were like falling into a fog of five miles, at a loss as to what to do. This is also enough to show a glimpse of its disruption.</p>
<h3>Cholera Epidemic in Suzhou; Japanese and Puppets Panic</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Recently, the autumn heat has turned cool. Cholera vomiting and diarrhea first occurred in the Mucun Township of Suzhou, spreading very quickly. The Japanese and puppets were panicked. They immediately banned the transportation of vegetables out of the area, and then it spread to the Fengmen and Xumen areas. Several people were suffering from cholera every day. The Japanese army was even more anxious. Under the protection of the puppet government, the schools have been ordered to suspend classes for six days. The epidemic is rampant, reaching the city.</p>
<h3>Qingpu: Puppet Officials Intercept Peddlers, Forcibly Demand Tolls</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Peddlers traveling to and from Qinghu Road, using bicycles to transport firewood, rice, fish, and meat from the countryside, sell them to fellow villagers who have taken refuge in Shanghai, and transport Shanghai cigarettes, candles, soap, etc. to Qing, in order to earn small profits. Unexpectedly, yesterday, they were forcibly detained by the puppet tax card stationed at Bridge No. 16 on that road, claiming that each vehicle must pay a tax of one yuan. It is heard that the peddlers have no cash and cannot pay, so they have not been released as of this morning.</p>
<h3>Key Figures of the Japanese Side in Xiamen: Mito Haruzo and Sawa Shigenobu (Continued)</h3>
<p>Naval Faction Overwhelms Xiamen Faction; Xiamen Expert Laboring in Vain</p>
<p>Although the head of the Japanese Military Special Agency in Xiamen is Sawa, the most active one is the head of the Intelligence Department, Sawa Shigenobu. Several years before the fall of Xiamen, Sawa Shigenobu had already come to Xiamen as a special commissioner of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. The so-called special commissioner is the head of espionage. He supplied the Taiwan Governor-General's Office with information from Xiamen and kept a group of Japanese and Taiwanese under his command. At that time, he was still operating semi-openly and semi-secretly. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Sawa Shigenobu also served as the president of the Quanmin Daily, the Japanese cultural aggression organ in Fujian, and only then did he openly come forward as a journalist. The Quanmin Daily also became the Japanese intelligence organ stationed in Xiamen. Sawa Shigenobu speaks fluent Xiamen dialect and also speaks very good Mandarin. He is insidious and alert in nature. In the Japanese intelligence department, he is a famous "China expert." Although his scope of activity is not large, his time is almost completely spent in Xiamen, but at least it can be said that he is a "Xiamen expert." He knows everything about Xiamen very clearly. He also fully understands the actions and character of several more prominent people in Xiamen.</p>
<p>Last year, after Xiamen fell, the Japanese side spent a lot of effort in creating a puppet organization. Since Sawa Shigenobu is a "Xiamen expert," the responsibility of searching for puppets fell on his head. He traveled back and forth between Xiamen, Gulangyu, and Hong Kong. He had invited Hong Xiaochun, the president of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce who was avoiding the war in Hong Kong, three times. In order to show his determination, Hong fled to Annam, which made Sawa Shigenobu feel embarrassed and return to Xiamen in frustration. At this time, Zhang Ming, carrying the Kuomintang Restoration Society signboard, flew from Tokyo to Xiamen. Therefore, Zhang came forward and brought together Zhou Shouqing, Hong Jinghao, and Ma Ma-Huhu to establish the puppet Xiamen Security Maintenance Association on June 20. Although the Japanese side did not look up to these puppets, because there was nowhere else to find them, they had to make do. Last winter, Zhang Ming left, Zhou Shouqing took refuge in Shanghai, and Hong Jinghao fled. The puppet organization almost collapsed. Sawa Shigenobu volunteered again, came forward to search for puppets, and ran around between Xiamen, Gulangyu, Guangdong, and Hong Kong again. After several months of running around, he finally managed to rope in Li Sixian. When he brought this treasure back from Hong Kong, all the key figures on the Japanese side were overjoyed. Li then became the puppet judicial director, then the puppet president, and then the puppet mayor, becoming a living treasure in the hands of the Japanese side in Xiamen.</p>
<p>After the fall of Xiamen, the Quanmin Daily moved over from Jinmen, occupying the Star Light Daily building and all its equipment. Sawa Shigenobu is still the president. In his capacity as a "Xiamen expert," he fabricated various rumors to lure refugees in Gulangyu back to Xiamen and to lure Taiwanese merchants to come to "prosper" Xiamen. Although the Quanmin Daily trumpeted "Xiamen is becoming brighter" and "Xiamen is prosperous" every day, the refugees in Gulangyu refused to be fooled. When Taiwanese businessmen arrived in Xiamen, they saw that the situation was not right and most of them returned on the original ship.</p>
<p>Sawa Shigenobu spends most of his time in Xiamen and is a "meritorious minister" in the Japanese invasion of Xiamen. However, he has also failed several times. At the beginning of the fall of Xiamen, a reporter from a certain newspaper who had not had time to evacuate was captured by the Japanese in Gulangyu. Sawa Shigenobu, with a hypocritical heart, guaranteed him out and supervised him to work at the Quanmin Daily. After more than a month, the reporter finally feigned illness to seek medical treatment in Gulangyu and, under heavy surveillance, escaped to the mainland. Another incident was on April 4 this year, when Sawa Shigenobu came up with the idea of ​​using the Xu Ying Academy to gather all the students of the puppet primary schools in Xiamen to celebrate Children's Day. With the topic of "Celebrating Children's Day for Sino-Japanese Friendship," he ordered the primary school students to write essays. He fully expected to receive many works of praise. Who knew that most of the primary school students handed in blank papers. Among them, three students actually spoke out and cursed, giving Sawa Shigenobu infinite discomfort. (End)</p>

<h3>Financial Hong Kong Group Buying Intent Revives; Cash Reaches the 4,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash stock market, initially following the easing of foreign exchange, tended to decline, but then it rose contrarily due to heavy purchases by Hong Kong groups, and ultimately closed at the high point of the day. Generally, retail investors, given the strong digestion of Hong Kong dollars in the past two days, although the price of Japanese gold has risen for two consecutive days, but calculating based on the late closing price of foreign exchange, it is still heavily repressed (English gold is calculated as 1,050 yuan, and the US exchange rate is 5,236 yuan) 1,050 yuan to 1,236 yuan, so most intend to sell out at a good price, so there may be continued increases in the future. When the stock opened, due to the easing of foreign exchange, those entering were hesitant, and it opened at a low price of 3,880 yuan. Then, after the securities group pulled it up, it returned to 3,930 yuan. Once, due to the dumping by the silver shop group, it fell slightly to 3,880 yuan. Later, the securities group and a certain money exchange industry were suddenly entrusted by Hong Kong customers to tend to acquire, and it jumped to 3,950 yuan. At noon, the buying wind slightly subsided, and it closed at 3,930 yuan. In the early afternoon, it was still flat. Soon, due to the revival of buying interest from the Hong Kong group, although some gold shops and silver shop groups had supplies, they still felt that it was a drop in the bucket and could not contain the momentum. As a result, it closed at the top price of 4,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was lively throughout the day, with about 2,000 taels. Silver shop ornaments eventually rose by 5 yuan, and the prices of Sino-British pure gold, etc., remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Stock increased by 70 yuan</p>

It was delayed until it opened at 9:25, and it fell slightly by 50 yuan. A certain gold shop gave money exchange industry two taels, with the price being 3,880 yuan. After the opening, the money exchange industry frequently came to absorb, and the securities group also took the opportunity to search for low prices. It soon rebounded by 50 yuan. The money exchange industry did 30 taels with each other, with the price being 3,930 yuan. At that time, it was suddenly heard that English gold had risen to four offices, causing the selling wind of retail investors to rise again, and the silver shop group also came to set sell, so it fell back to 3,880 yuan. After that, because the buying wind of the securities group revived, and the money exchange industry and others competed to absorb power, although some gold shops took the opportunity to come out, the position still felt that it was not enough distribution, and the price soared by 70 yuan. The money exchange industry did 20 taels with each other, with the price being 3,950 yuan. Near noon, because the securities group had been watching, and the silver shop group and a certain gold shop continued to throw out, the price fell back by 30 yuan. The gold shop did 20 taels with each other, with the price being 3,920 yuan, as the noon closing price. The early afternoon opening raised by 10 yuan, the cash gold shop sold 10 taels to the money exchange industry, with the price being 3,930 yuan. Then it spat out 30 taels to the money exchange industry, with the price being 3,925 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong group suddenly entrusted the securities group and a certain money exchange industry to rush forward, coupled with the fact that many sellers watched and did not move forward, the price soared by 55 yuan. The securities group entered the gold shop with 20 taels, with the price being 3,980 yuan. Later, because the silver shop group and others threw out, it fell back by 20 yuan. The silver shop group sold 10 taels to the securities company, with the price being 3,960 yuan. After entering, because the securities group and the money exchange industry re-purchased for the Hong Kong group, although a certain gold shop and silver shop group and retail investors had thrown out, they all took the opportunity to raise the price, causing it to rise sharply by 40 yuan again. The securities group entered the silver shop group, the money exchange industry, and a certain silver shop with a total of 50 taels, with the price being 4,000 yuan, as the late closing price. As a result, compared with the previous day, it had risen sharply by 70 yuan. It was heard that the securities group had re-entered the money exchange industry and a certain silver shop with a total of 100 taels, with the price being 4,000 yuan and 3,995 yuan. The whole day fluctuated by 120 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher according to the stock market, and the current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower according to the quoted gold, and there were few transactions.</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Recovered</h3>
<p>Rubber Stocks Dominated</p>
<p>Yesterday's after-hours market for securities showed a slightly firmer trend, but remained in a revolving state. The morale of the various groups was lax, and the number of people gathering in the market was sparse. The rising trend initially began in the morning, but then felt weak in the afternoon, and the mood was idle and indifferent. Most were waiting quietly for changes in the situation. At the initial opening yesterday morning, Tiensheng Lianhe was buying, but No. 5 and No. 42 came out again, with the trend initially firm but then fatigued. Later, Songmao and retail investors still had a strong appetite, and Category C stocks surprisingly broke through the 3 yuan mark. Daqing also took the opportunity to sell at a high price. Transactions were scarce in the afternoon. Lianyi had a volume of entries yesterday, and Yongkang was again seeking sales at a good price, with only a few other embellishments. Yesterday's results showed a slight improvement of 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was only around 400,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that rubber stocks dominated yesterday, stimulated by the sharp rise in London and Singapore's raw rubber prices. The transaction volume was extremely large. Shares of almost all rubber companies were traded. The market was generally firm, but transactions did not exceed regulations. Price advances followed the procedure and were disciplined. Yihua Yarn Factory shares were relatively cold, but Shanghai Yarn Factory shares climbed to a new high of 130 yuan, with buyers at that price at the close. Huidefeng shares also rose sharply, reaching 33.25 yuan, while Steel shares soared to 6.4 jiao, compared to the previous transaction price of only 4.7 jiao. Generally, it is imagined that a certain inherent brewing fact has been discovered for this highly speculative stock.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sales to Customers Became Quiet; Yarn Market Rise Also Leveled Out</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, saw a significant reduction in current yarn transactions yesterday due to clearing of sales to customers and the departure of ships to other ports. However, industry insiders still held the belief that prices were more likely to rise than fall, so they were unwilling to release the yarn that had been dragged in unless they could make a big profit. Market prices remained in a stable state, but the black market for foreign exchange stood on the horizontal line, and gold was also in a revolving state. The number of new buyers in the market was not as large as in the past. Apart from Shuangma continuing to rise by 20 yuan, other prices were flat.</p>
<p>At the opening of current yarn in the morning, a certain gentleman in the industry came out to raise prices, purchasing Shuangma spot prices at 775 yuan, 10 bales. The market situation was enthusiastic at the time, but Guangdong's Wanxing heard the shouting price very high and suddenly came out to shout sell, only selling 20 Shuangma spot goods for 773 yuan 10 bales, and the market situation immediately flattened. The stack bill price shouted 688 yuan. A short time later, because sales to customers were stagnant, the market outlook turned down, and Shuangma spot prices fell to 765 yuan, and the stack bill price to 675 yuan. The closing slightly improved. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,420 bales were traded. The market price of 20 Shuangma rose by 20, with no more. Tiannv didn't move, Shuangdiqiu rose by 5 yuan, Muyang rose by 8 yuan, and Wufu yarn rose by 8 yuan. 395 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>White Cotton Trade Bustled</h3>
<p>Market to Rise Again One or Two Yuan</p>
<p>The current cotton trade continues to improve. Chinese factories Shenxin and Yong'an are making large purchases of raw cotton above 20 counts, while other factories are rarely moving. Qingdao Yarn Factory has handled two to three thousand pieces. The local Japanese factory's intake has stagnated, but inter-industry trading is still bustling. White-bag cotton clothing transactions account for the majority, and the market is up by one or two yuan compared to the previous day. The source of Subei cotton is becoming smoother every day. About five to six hundred bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the pier, and another 450 bales came from Beisha. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message: Due to the increasing difficulty of overseas transportation and the decreasing inventory in Shanghai, all industry insiders are planning to wait for a good price to sell. Therefore, the shouting price of raw cotton is quite high. White Roche cotton, which can only spin 16 counts, is demanding more than 160 yuan. 20-count West Indian cotton is also around 160 yuan because of its inferior color. 30-count Brazilian cotton spot is priced at 202 yuan, 42-count superior white American cotton is priced at more than 230 yuan, and 60-count Egyptian cotton has a team rate increase of 8 percent, combining to more than 340 yuan. These are all new highs since Qing dynasty.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was active again yesterday. The opening was still calm, and prices did not fluctuate much. Later, due to the purchase of speculators and the gradual improvement of spot transactions, and the general purchase, the market situation became higher and higher. Until the close, the market price rose by 27 to 8 pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian market was closed yesterday, but the forecast was three rupees higher than yesterday's closing price, and Egyptian cotton was more than 60 pounds.</p>
<h3>Grains: Customer Xian Rice Arrived Continuously; Selling at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Domi Market Conversely Showed Expensive; Special Tin Glutinous Rice Opened at 42 Yuan</p>
<p>No domi arrived from the river yesterday. Wheel dumplings continued to arrive from various places, more than 4,000 bales, which made thick glutinous rice particularly popular, and shop stomachs were still welcome. As a result, it continued to rise by more than one yuan. However, various old and new jians arrived in an endless stream, and customer vendors had a large amount of goods, and everyone wanted to sell quickly first. Therefore, at the opening of yesterday's market, each jian fell all the way by about two yuan. It was not until near noon that the fall penetrated that the street office was moved. Therefore, the closing situation was already tighter. Special Tin glutinous rice opened at 42 yuan, high-grade goods at 41 yuan to 40 yuan, Su Tong Kun glutinous rice at 40 yuan, 39.7 yuan and 39 yuan, river early and late rice at 35.5 yuan to 34.6 yuan, dumplings at 38.2 yuan to 37.5 yuan, Jiangbei jian initially opened and fell by one yuan, to 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan, later to 25 yuan, Wuhu old jian 26 yuan to 25 yuan, new jian 25.5 yuan to 25 yuan, Jiaxing new Sichuan jian 25.5 yuan, new Yang jian 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan, Gao Tuan jian 28.5 yuan, middle 27.5 yuan to 27 yuan, and Yuan 32 yuan. The city traded more than 5,000 bales.</p>
<p>Customer Xian continued to decline yesterday. Because the source from the north of the Yangtze River was endless, new Xian was also transported by wheel in an endless stream. Old Xian continued to arrive at the port with a total of five to ten bales, and new Jian from the mainland also arrived in the market one after another. The cargo owners sold them in the market at reduced prices in order to sell them all together. Therefore, after the opening price in the morning, it was seen to be going down all the way. As a result, each new and old small seven or eight jiao to one yuan. The Jiangbei new Xian and Jingwu old Xian were only 26 yuan, and the medium and secondary prices were from 25 yuan to about 24 yuan. The old and secondary low-grade goods were only about 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Flour Rose Again</h3>
<p>The Market for Repurchased Goods Settled; Pipe Store Wheat 10.6 Yuan</p>
<p>The current flour factory price has risen by another 0.2 yuan, reaching 7.1 yuan in cash. Each factory is still optimistic and unwilling to supply a large amount. However, the market for repurchased goods was normal again yesterday, still at 7.3 to 4 jiao. Although sales to customers are said to be continuous, the local demand is not very strong. Therefore, the rising trend of repurchased goods has retreated, and some retail investors have released them. The total transaction volume is estimated to be about 50,000 bales. 8,000 bales of flour will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 13th.</p>
<p>Wheat has gradually risen. The source of vehicles and ships is endless. However, cargo owners are increasingly hoarding. Yesterday, the factory and the hoarders gradually pulled in, but the eating plate has been paid more attention. As a result, the market price still rose by one or two corners compared to the previous day. The hoarders handled more than ten cars throughout the market. Fuxin and Fufeng factories jointly handled 12,000 to 3,000 bales. The highest price of pipe store wheat has reached 10.6 yuan. 350 bales of wheat came from Beisha on the 12th.</p>

<p>Domestic Huizhou white has been greatly raised due to the shortage of Shantou cotton white. Yesterday, dozens of bales were opened by Guangbang numbers, and they saw a new record of 72 yuan, an increase of about 10 yuan from last weekend.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Peach Kernels Appeared on the Market</h3>
<p>The first batch of new peach kernels has arrived in Jinan, 10 baskets. The samples were seen yesterday. The color and luster are still good, but the identity is softer, and the grains are not large. Because it is the first time to see new products, it feels quite rare. Therefore, the opening price reached 140 yuan. In addition, it is rumored that the more than 1,000 pieces of old Haozhou peaches that arrived a few days ago can be opened at only 30 yuan, which is obviously not true. A part of them was opened yesterday, with dried peaches at 55 yuan and ordinary peaches at 40 yuan. A certain firm wanted to buy more and returned 35 or 6 yuan, but the number said that they insisted on 40 yuan.</p>

The total market price opened 50 pieces of Yanzhi oil, 100 pieces of Qingzhi oil, 150 barrels of Dalian oil, 100 barrels of Kobe oil, and 80 barrels of Qingdao oil.</p>
<p>Although 150 pieces of Jiaozhou basket raw oil were handled by the Hong Kong gang, the stomach was not full, and the market price still held the original plate of the weekend (70 yuan). However, due to the lack of inventory, it is difficult to fall.</p>
<p>680 bales of soybeans came from Beisha on the 12th, and 1,840 bales were shipped to Hong Kong on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate Remained Firm and High as Before</h3>
<p>In the hardware market, various goods jumped wildly at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. It was only yesterday that it settled. For example, the original price of nails was 25 yuan, and it soared to 60 yuan. However, the recent opening price is only 56 yuan to 89 yuan, which is softer than before. Your company's horseshoe iron is still rising without falling. The local can factories, toy factories, and printing factories have a good demand. Those who hold the goods are in high spirits, so the opening price is not loose. For example, 200-pound American positive goods are sold for 220 yuan per box, 180-pound American goods are sold for 200 yuan, 200-pound Italian goods are sold for 190 yuan, and 180-pound Italian goods are sold for 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Female Color Gang Searched for Clothing Flannel</h3>

Yesterday, such as long-haired velvet, short-haired velvet, black, gray, and yellow lambskin, Qini, screw thread, and various overcoat flannels made in Poland were negotiated and sold. Those with strong capital mostly pre-purchased the entire box, but most of them were combined with two or three products, and the majority paid a deposit and limited the time to clear the goods.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Shanghai's Status: U.S. Increases Troops to Shanghai: Sixth Regiment is Crossing the Pacific: Settlement of Shanghai Municipal Council's Negotiations Has Not Yet Materialized: Situation in the Area of ​​Illegal Road Construction in Western Shanghai Has Eased</h3>
<p>News from the foreign side: The US government, having received reports from various parties, widely circulated that the Japanese government would take the opportunity during the European War to seize the management rights of the Shanghai concession. On the 9th, Secretary of State Hull summoned the Japanese Ambassador to the US, Kenkichi Horiuchi, at the State Department to issue a warning, declaring that the US government would absolutely not tolerate unilateral Japanese actions to change the status of Shanghai. The wording was as resolute as the previous declaration that it would never allow the abandonment of interests in the Far East. Less than 48 hours after Horiuchi's visit to Secretary of State Hull, the US Treasure Island Radio Station broadcast a shocking message the night before (the 11th), stating that the US Marine Corps Sixth Regiment had been ordered to set off for Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Sixth Regiment is Already En Route</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, according to a broadcast message from the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco last night (the 11th), the US government has decided to send the US Marine Corps Sixth Regiment to Shanghai to increase the current US military strength in Shanghai. This is because the Japanese are increasing pressure on the Shanghai Public Concession. The Sixth Regiment is already on board the US ship Langley, crossing the Pacific Ocean to join the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in the city. The US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai is currently preparing barracks to accommodate this increased force. If this statement is true, the US military stationed in Shanghai will double. However, late last night, the headquarters of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai stated that they had not heard of this action and had not prepared barracks for the Sixth Regiment.</p>
<p>Past Events Make it More Believable</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that there was a rumor in Shanghai that another US Marine Corps was en route to Shanghai, and the city's radio listeners heard the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco broadcast that the Sixth Regiment had set off for this place, which made it more believable. Although the headquarters of the Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai claimed that they had not heard of this matter, rumors among the officers and soldiers of the Fourth Regiment that the Sixth Regiment had been ordered to reinforce them were not new. According to a similar incident that occurred in 1930. At that time, the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai only had the First and Third Battalions. One day, it was reported that the Second Battalion would be dispatched to Shanghai, and the regiment headquarters denied it. However, two months later, the Second Battalion did arrive in full force. According to historical records, the US Marine Corps Sixth Regiment had previously come to China. When the Fourth Regiment arrived in Shanghai in 1927, the Sixth Regiment went to Tianjin. The pilots, tank soldiers, and artillery of the Tenth Regiment followed. In 1937, the Sixth Regiment returned to the East, with the Tenth Regiment's anti-aircraft guns and heavy machine gun teams. After being stationed in Shanghai for several months, it withdrew in 1938.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between the Two Sides Have Not Yet Approached</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of illegal road construction, the Shanghai Municipal Council did begin negotiations with the Japanese side the day before yesterday. Negotiations are currently underway to find a solution. The opinions of the two sides have not yet approached for a while. Rumors outside that the settlement had already been reached, as evidenced by the statement of the Dada News Agency yesterday, proved to be premature. The rumored settlement plan, which would return the police power of the old illegal road construction to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the police power of the newly built illegal road construction to the pseudo-municipal government, is only the ideal of a few foreigners. Regarding the future of the negotiations, reporters yesterday consulted opinions from various circles in China and abroad. The conclusion reached was mostly pessimistic. As for the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, they were all unwilling to express their opinions for the time being. According to the articles of the Shanghai Municipal Council, all major administrative events must be discussed and approved by the board of directors. It is now known that the Shanghai Municipal Council has not submitted a report on this matter to the British, American, and Chinese directors, so it is not allowed to be discussed.</p>
<p>The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Eased</p>
<p>Since the 9th, after the Japanese puppets occupied houses and deployed posts in the western section of Jessie Road, Rue Cardinal Mercier, and Bubbling Well Road (west of Haig Road), the situation was very tense at the time, and residents were greatly panicked. However, the actions of the Japanese puppets have not expanded in recent days. Therefore, the situation in the western Shanghai area has eased yesterday. The situation yesterday is divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>Reduced Number of Pseudo Police on Illegal Road Construction</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank staff dormitory at 760 Bubbling Well Road was occupied on the 10th. The number of pseudo police stationed in front of the building yesterday was six. In addition, there was one Japanese military policeman. The bank staff were still able to enter and exit and move out their belongings. The number of pseudo police stationed in front of the entrance to the 31st Shelter of the Tzu Lien Society at 11 Jessie Road has been reduced to four, the same as the previous day. As for the Japanese army and pseudo police stationed inside, the number was sometimes large and sometimes small, sometimes a total of thirty or forty people, and sometimes only more than ten people. There were fewer people staying in the shelter at night. Middle school students who were displaced children have resumed classes since yesterday, and the Japanese puppets have not interfered. Pseudo police were no longer seen at the entrance of Diyi Garden at 15 Jessie Road, but a few remained inside.</p>
<p>Restricting Relocation and Checking Pedestrians</p>
<p>The situation in the Kangjiaqiao Jinjia Lane Road Bridge area is still slightly more tense than in other places. The Jinsitufu Temple area in Kangjiaqiao is a concentrated location for pseudo police, with a total of more than 100 people. At the entrances of Siming Villa and Zhongshi New Village on Rue Cardinal Mercier, there were still two pseudo police stationed, the same as the previous day. Residents in the two lanes have been preparing to move out since yesterday, but they must obtain permission from the Japanese military police in advance and obtain a relocation permit before they can avoid being harassed by the pseudo police. Six armed pseudo police are stationed at the entrance of Qianjia Lane, opposite Yuguang Village. Pedestrians entering and exiting at night are often interrogated.</p>
<p>Concession Detectives Patrol as Usual</p>
<p>The red police vehicles in the concession area still patrolled at scheduled times in various places where illegal roads were built, and increased the number of Indian horse patrol teams and motorcycle teams. However, the police detectives on the vehicles no longer searched pedestrians. Although the police vehicles repeatedly drove past the locations where the pseudo police were stationed, no conflicts occurred. However, the police guards at the entrances of the major lanes on Bubbling Well Road have been driven away by the pseudo police and replaced by plainclothes pseudo police to watch. Public buses Nos. 1 and 9 and trolleybuses No. 21 running in the area still operate as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers' Actions Sometimes Transgress</p>
<p>It is also learned that the previous night (the 11th), a Japanese military policeman with a command knife stood in the middle of the road near 11 Jessie Road, prohibiting pedestrians from passing through. Vehicles were still allowed to travel as usual, but they all bypassed him. Another Japanese military policeman drove a motorcycle along Rue Pichon past the British Army Headquarters. The vehicle did not have a meeting and did not indicate any identifiable symbols. According to the guarantee provided by Fang Hui to the Shanghai Municipal Council last year, all Japanese military vehicles traveling on the roads of the concession should hang duck egg-style military passes, but the vehicle obviously violated the guarantee.</p>
<p>The Municipality's Attitude Towards Paying Taxes</p>
<p>According to reports, "The Great Way Government is currently making every effort to plan the tax revenue of residents in the area of ​​illegal road construction, seeking ways to seize it. On the evening of the 11th, it aroused serious attention from the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to senior officials, this move by the "Reformed Government" has nothing to do with the Shanghai Municipal Council itself, and the municipality does not pay attention to it. According to the senior official, the tax revenue was initially handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council and a third party to collect from the residents, so it is not the Shanghai Municipal Council's business. It continued to say that if the residents of illegal road construction submit their taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, then the Shanghai Municipal Council also has an obligation to fulfill. As for the work of the Shanghai Municipal Council, such as residents refusing to pay taxes, the municipality will cut them off, and at that time, the relationship between the two parties will also be broken. The Shanghai Municipal Council itself, whether before or after the Sino-Japanese War, will enforce various measures. This is called the work of the Shanghai Municipal Council, that is, building roads and laying water pipes in the area of ​​illegal road construction to draw tap water. The establishment of other facilities such as gas, telephones, and electricity has been completed. It also stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council has only received 529,000 yuan in tax revenue from illegal road construction in the six months of this year. If the Shanghai Municipal Council does not</p>
<p>With this income, it does not need to fulfill its obligations to the area, or ask whether the Shanghai Municipal Council feels difficult in collecting taxes in the area of ​​illegal road construction. According to the answer, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, there have indeed been some minor difficulties. Since the 11th, the Japanese military police and "Great Way Government" personnel have been inspecting the shops in the area one by one, which has formed a serious tense state. At present, it has not been confirmed whether the Japanese side and the "Great Way" Municipal Government will inspect the residents of the area. According to another aspect, the various rules for inspecting residents have been revealed. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it does not intend to negotiate or discuss with the Japanese side or the "Great Way Government".</p>
<h3>British and French Women in Shanghai Contribute to Their Motherland: British Women's Association Schedules Meeting Today: French Ambassador's Wife Holds Public Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The committee of the British Women's Association in Shanghai believes that since the outbreak of the European War and the formal declaration of war against Germany by the country a week ago, it is necessary to express something in order to grasp the nature of women. It has been decided to convene a general meeting of all members at the association's clubhouse at No. 11 Bund this morning to discuss how the British women in Shanghai should contribute to the country and the work plan for the association's service to the war. As for the content of the plan, it has not been announced.</p>
<p>The wife of the French Ambassador, Mrs. Cosme, held the First Determined Women's Congress at the Garden of St. Therese at No. 151 Rue Amiral Bayle at 2:00 pm yesterday to discuss how to knit woolen vests and other items to donate to the soldiers at the front, and stipulated that every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm will be the meeting date in order to discuss everything at any time. If French expatriates have items to donate, they can be sent to Mrs. Caden at No. 753B23 Haig Road for forwarding.</p>
<h3>The Far East Crisis Intensifies: Important Statements from Shanghai Public Organizations. Telegrams Sent to the U.S. President and Soviet Ambassador, Requesting the Cessation of Aggression and Continued Assistance.</h3>
<p>Recently, various important public organizations in Shanghai, due to the outbreak of the European war and the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, jointly telegraphed President Roosevelt of the United States, Secretary of State Hull, and the newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to China, Panushkin, expressing China's views. The original telegrams are translated as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the U.S. President:</p>
<p>To President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, Washington: Since the outbreak of the European war, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense. We urgently appeal to your country to swiftly adopt the most effective measures to sanction the aggressors for taking advantage of the opportunity in the Far East to expand their acts of aggression and to prevent them from continuing to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of third countries, such as maintaining the integrity of customs administration and preserving the status of the Provisional Court. Your noble demeanor in governing your country is fully demonstrated, and we express our deep trust and admiration. We are willing to exert our utmost efforts to be the backing for your country. At the same time, we firmly believe that the friendship between China and the United States will become even more cordial. We hereby send this telegram, hoping for your insightful consideration.</p>
<p>To the Soviet Embassy:</p>
<p>To Ambassador Panushkin of the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing: We have learned of your honorable appointment, and the four million citizens of Shanghai unanimously express their joy and congratulations. At the same time, upon seeing reports of the credentials and speech you presented, we extend our deepest respect. Now that the European war has broken out again and the situation in the Far East is becoming more severe, we request that you relay to your government to continue actively assisting our country and hope that under any circumstances, no compromise will be made with Japan, so that Sino-Soviet relations will become more solid and the cornerstone of Pacific peace can be laid. We respectfully send this telegram of congratulations, hoping for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Extradition of Four Chinese in Tianjin: Responsibility of the British Military Commander. Intense Debate in the Assize Court. Hearings to Continue This Week. The Efficiency Issue of Telegraphic Notification of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case have recently been handed over to a court under Japanese control and are in the hands of the Japanese. Regarding the application for a writ of habeas corpus for the four defendants, Jones, the British Assize Court judge in China, issued a writ of habeas corpus earlier this month to Sir Lawrie, the commander of the British garrison in Tianjin responsible for detaining the four defendants. Judge Jones held a hearing on the writ in his office yesterday (the 11th). After a defense lawyer representing the defendant, Sir Lawrie, raised an objection, Judge Jones adjourned the hearing, which will continue this week. The lawyer for the four Chinese plaintiffs is Jones from the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in this city. Mr. Jones argued yesterday that Sir Lawrie, knowing that the British Assize Court here had issued a writ of habeas corpus, handed over the suspects, which was contempt of court. Although Sir Lawrie had not actually received the writ when he carried out the extradition, the decision to issue the writ had been telegraphed to Sir Lawrie in advance. The defense lawyer, Mr. Preswitt, noticed that a certain necessary affidavit issued in Tianjin had not arrived in Shanghai and requested an adjournment of the hearing. He also objected, arguing that if Sir Lawrie had not personally received the writ, his actions did not constitute contempt of court, and that the writ was remedial rather than punitive. Mr. Preswitt was representing Sir Lawrie and not the government. Although Sir Lawrie had received orders from the government to hand over the four defendants, if the suspects' lawyer proved that the telegraphic notification of the court's decision had the same effect as a mailed order, then Sir Lawrie would be personally responsible for the extradition of the four defendants. When personnel at the British Embassy here heard on the first of this month that the British Assize Court had issued a writ of habeas corpus, they expressed the view that the legal authority over the suspects rested with the administrative organs of the British concession, not the commander of the British garrison.</p>
<h3>Authorities in the Two Concessions Set a Date for Preparedness. Assemblies Prohibited Starting Today.</h3>
<p>The police authorities in the two concessions have decided to continue to adopt joint precautionary measures for the "September 18th" anniversary. Emergency measures will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month. Assemblies, associations, parades, and other activities will be prohibited starting on the 13th. At that time, non-essential roads and alleys at the junction of the British and French concessions will be blocked, following the "July 7th" anniversary measures. All police personnel and national defense forces will be deployed for guard duty. Furthermore, all circles in this city maintain a calm attitude towards the eighth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident and will not make any formal demonstrations.</p>
<h3>400 Jewish Refugees Arrived Yesterday.</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, another group of 400 European Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai aboard the Italian liner Conte Biancamano. Representatives from the European Jewish Refugee Committee met them at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf and sent them to various places of accommodation. The Japanese, the French Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Jewish authorities organized a special refugee committee last month to regulate the entry of Jewish refugees into Shanghai. It was decided that refugees who had already started their journey or purchased tickets when the committee was established would be allowed to come to Shanghai. At that time, there were a thousand immigrants who had already purchased tickets to come to Shanghai, including 200 on the Japanese ship Hakozan Maru (transliteration), 150 on the French ship Athos II, 500 on the German ship Potsdam, and 400 on the Italian ship Conte Biancamano. Therefore, the 400 refugees aboard the Italian ship that arrived in Shanghai today can freely disembark. The German ship Potsdam suspended its voyages after the outbreak of the European war, and the immigrants who had purchased tickets for that ship were unable to travel. It is reported that the Hakozan Maru is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Gather in Southern Huangpu.</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Security Forces of the Chinese side have been dispatched to the areas near Minhang along the Huangpu River estuary and Longhua Bay. All the puppet troops have defected and made contact with the mobile units in the Songjiang area. Therefore, the Japanese naval and land forces have been on alert in the vicinity. However, on the opposite bank, the guerrilla forces in the towns of Zhanggang, Duxing, and Tangkou in Punan have been responding to this side. For precautionary purposes, the Japanese have gathered five warships, adopting a vigilant posture.</p>
<h3>President Kong's Birthday Celebrations Diverted to Relief Efforts.</h3>
<p>September 19th of this year is President Kong's 60th birthday. He has firmly refused any gifts from relatives and friends. Some people here have initiated a plan to divert the birthday gifts prepared by everyone to relief efforts, and all gifts will be handed over to the Central Bank in this city for collection. Those from all walks of life who are willing to join can send their gifts before the birthday, so that they can be collected and transferred.</p>

<h3>Navigation to Eastern Zhejiang Reopened. The "Heda" Joins the Shanghai-Ningbo Route. Voyages to Wenzhou are Still Experimental.</h3>
<p>Navigation to Eastern Zhejiang has been restricted for a long time. Now, with the permission of the authorities, ports have been opened to allow ships to dock, and import and export goods inspection stations have been established. However, ships that have not been approved in advance are absolutely not allowed to pass. Dangerous defensive materials have been deployed at the river mouth, and pilots must be dispatched by the authorities.</p>
<p>There are a total of seven ships sailing the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Except for the Taikoo Shipping's Yingzhou, which does not carry passengers, only six ships can take passengers. Among them, the future of the three German-flagged ships continuing to sail is currently uncertain. The Moufu is waiting in Zhenhai to load cargo and may be able to return to Shanghai today. The company had no news yesterday. It is claimed that it will definitely return to Shanghai within the next two days. The Far Eastern Company's Hana is slightly delayed in returning to Shanghai because the loading and unloading of goods in Zhenhai Port must be carried out in sequence. The American company, Wei Li Han's Xinanna, used to sail the Shanghai-Tianjin line, but now, due to the severe flooding in Tianjin, navigation is difficult, so it has been changed to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is scheduled to clear customs today (the 13th) and set sail for Ningbo at dawn tomorrow, at the same time as the Zhongyi Company's Ende. Furthermore, the Norwegian company Heda recently brought cheap Yang rice from Saigon to Shanghai. Now that unloading has been completed, it is said that it is now managed by the Zhongyi Company and has joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. It is scheduled to clear customs on the 15th and set sail for Zhenhai on the morning of the 16th. The company has telegraphed Ningbo to handle all the procedures and is expected to obtain approval. Although the Shanghai-Wenzhou route already has the Xixiangtai, which sailed to Wenzhou the day before yesterday (the 10th), followed by Yilong's Shenfu and Huatai's Xinantong, all of which are scheduled to sail to Wenzhou today, they are all experimental voyages, only loading cargo and not taking passengers. As for passengers and cargo from Ningbo to Zhenhai, they are all transported by small boats. The Yinxian Shipping Association has now stipulated the fare for passengers transferring to small boats: from Ningbo to the anchorage outside the blockade line, 70 cents per person; to the anchorage on the Yunshan waters outside the port, one yuan per person; and to the anchorage on the Ligang waters, 1.30 yuan per person.</p>
<h3>American Residents in Yantai Suffer Badly: Frequent Searches by Japanese Troops, Even the American Consulate is Not Spared.</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, a visitor from Yantai reported yesterday (the 11th) that American residents in Yantai have been repeatedly searched by the Japanese military authorities. Even the American Consul stationed in Yantai has not been spared. The Japanese are attempting to severely restrict all financial transactions and withdrawals, and have sent troops to station themselves in the major foreign banks in Yantai. Anyone entering or leaving the bank, regardless of who they are, is inspected, especially those entering and leaving HSBC. On the first of this month, the American Consul himself was also inspected. The American Consulate in Shanghai has not been able to confirm this statement, but it acknowledges that consulate officials report such incidents directly to the American Embassy in Beiping. This kind of news only reaches Shanghai indirectly.</p>
<h3>British Protect German Jewish Refugees: Jewish Employees of British Companies Will Not Be Dismissed for the Time Being.</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, Mr. Hein, the chairman of the European Refugee Committee, stated yesterday (the 11th) that British companies here will, at least for the time being, not apply the British government's regulations prohibiting British citizens from trading with the enemy to German Jewish refugees they employ. The British Consul-General, Mr. Phillips, has asked him to announce to British landlords and personnel of British companies that those who wish to dismiss German Jewish tenants or employees should consult with the British Consulate first. It is now believed that the issue of the special status of German refugees here has been submitted to the London authorities for a decision. The British Consul-General is awaiting a reply and is organizing a special committee to study and answer inquiries about the current status of refugees.</p>
<h3>Cheap Rice Sales About to Begin: Rice Prices Expected to Fall. Tribute Rice Distribution on Schedule; Rice Registration Extended.</h3>
<p>In recent days, the number of rice and grain shipments from Jiangbei to Shanghai has been increasing daily, with the total amount reaching 8,455 bags, including 270 piculs from the inland river. Market prices have weakened due to the abundance of goods. Indica rice has fallen back by one yuan, with Jiangbei indica selling for 35 yuan and Wu indica selling for 33.8 yuan. Japonica rice is still between 36 and 40 yuan. However, due to the impending cheap rice sales, sales volume is low. According to news from the rice market, after the authorities implement cheap rice sales, rice prices are expected to fall back.</p>
<p>In addition, the distribution of tribute rice has been scheduled for five districts. Because of the need to build reed sheds, the construction cost for each location is more than a hundred yuan, and the construction is currently being undertaken by the Engineering Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The temporary staff hired at the distribution locations also aim to serve as volunteers. As for the date of the start of the distribution, the earliest could be this Saturday (the 16th), but at the latest, it can be started by next Monday (the 18th). Furthermore, the registration for ordering foreign rice by the Accountants' Association was originally scheduled to close today. Because some of the registration forms requested by various sectors have not yet been filled out and submitted, the association has specifically decided to extend the deadline for several days, urging everyone to submit them as soon as possible so that a meeting of the subscribers can be convened to decide on all procedures.</p>
<h3>Irregular Ships on the Southeast Asia Route Take the Opportunity to Become Active. The Wah Lun Shipping Company Adds Ships to Sail to Hong Kong; Chia Cheng Shipping Opens a Singapore Route.</h3>
<p>Regular cargo ships on the Southeast Asia route have been affected by the European war. Irregular ships from neutral countries are taking the opportunity to become active. The Norwegian company Wah Lun Shipping has added extra ships to sail. Chia Cheng Shipping, Tong Yi Shipping, and Hong Yun Shipping, among other companies, have been renting Norwegian and Swedish ships to sail to Hong Kong, Haiphong, Little Luzon, Singapore, and Penang, among other places in Southeast Asia. Every ship is fully loaded, and business is ten times more profitable. Wah Lun Shipping's own ships are not [illegible] shipping. Now, it has also rented the Swedish ship Damaxilan, which is scheduled to set sail for Hong Kong on the 16th. Chia Cheng Shipping is planning to open a Singapore route and is currently making preparations.</p>
<h3>Book Industry Giant Shen Zhifang Passes Away.</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Zhifang, originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, passed away at 8:00 PM on the 11th of this month due to cancer, at the age of fifty-eight. It is reported that the encoffining ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM on the 13th at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road. Mr. Shen had been living in Shanghai for many years and was a giant in the book industry. He once managed the Commercial Press with Mr. Xia Cuifang, and organized the China Book Company with Mr. Lufei Bohong. Later, he founded the World Book Company, serving as the general manager. With his great vision and extraordinary魄力, he quickly formed a tripartite alliance with the Commercial Press and the China Book Company. In particular, the textbooks he published for various levels of schools were well-known and popular at the time. In the autumn of 1934, due to his gradual physical decline, he was unable to cope with the arduous work and resigned from his position as general manager to the board of directors, but was still hired as a supervisor to provide assistance. In his later years, he also sponsored many charitable causes, such as the Moral Endeavor Society and the World Red Swastika Society, participating in disaster relief efforts to the best of his ability. In summary, Mr. Shen dedicated his life to culture and serving society. Now that he has suddenly passed away, all who hear of it are saddened and mourn his loss.</p>
<h3>Public Organizations Jointly Write to the Courts, Urging Them to Stop Unwarranted Rent Increases. Citizens Already Feel Like They are in Dire Straits; Unwarranted Rent Increases Will Further Affect People's Livelihoods and Order.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various public parks in this city jointly sent letters to the First Special District Court of Shanghai, the Second Special District Court, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. The letters stated: "Respectfully submitted, since the westward shift of the war, Shanghai has become an isolated island. Over the past two years, the number of people seeking refuge here has been increasing daily, resulting in a distorted development in a special situation. However, while there are not a few people with assets who have great vision, engage in great operations, and seek welfare for the local area, the majority are those who only seek their own private interests and disregard public peace. These people recklessly purchase foreign exchange with their capital and manipulate and hoard goods, causing prices to soar. As a result, society is in a precarious state of unrest. The general public is experiencing tremendous pressure on the three major elements of life: clothing, food, and housing, leading to serious problems. The cost of clothing and food has increased many times over, and ordinary people in the middle and lower classes are largely unable to maintain their livelihoods. The housing problem is even more complex, with disputes arising frequently everywhere. Landlords, without a sense of righteousness and only knowing how to profit from the national crisis, not only rent out all their vacant houses but still think it is not enough, and often take the initiative to increase rents on unwarranted grounds. They are also aware that increasing rents at this time is not in accordance with the law, so they threaten to renovate or take back the property for their own use, or to cut off water and electricity. Even more abhorrently, they threaten to order the removal of additional structures built on the original leased property years or decades ago, or to alter the structures. All kinds of oppression are endless. As a result, lawsuits are often heard. However, the pretexts for these lawsuits are all aimed at increasing rents. The public organizations are well aware that many residents in the middle and lower classes of Shanghai have made internal alterations and additions to their homes, and even more so for shops, due to various renovation needs. If rent increases are not based on legal provisions but are based on threats of relocation, renovation, and removal of additional structures to achieve their goals, then the example will be followed everywhere, and disputes will increase. The public organizations believe that the occurrence of such events is of great concern to the people's livelihoods and the stability and order of the local area and should be given serious consideration and close attention. They know that the justices of your court are aware of the people's plight and are working to benefit the common people, and will not be deceived by these greedy people. Moreover, the public organizations highly respect the spirit of judicial independence and would never dare to initiate any interference. However, the millions of people in the two concessions of Shanghai are already in dire straits in this current environment. What they feel is a crisis, and it is difficult to remain silent. Moreover, the public organizations are also national organizations and bear the responsibility of maintaining local stability and public morale. Therefore, we venture to offer this advice in the hope that it will be adopted. Please pay attention to lawsuits regarding housing issues and render fair judgments in accordance with the law, so that landlords will not be allowed to use coercive means to achieve the purpose of increasing rents. Then, we will not be able to help but offer our sincere prayers. We earnestly submit this appeal, hoping for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Applications for Certificates of National Goods Require Certification from the Chamber of Commerce. Certifications from Other Organizations are Invalid.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently received a notice from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating, "The Ministry's issuance of certificates of national goods aims to commend the products of national factories, which is extremely important. When Shanghai manufacturers apply for certificates, the organizations certifying the matter at the end of the application form have now been re-specified by the Ministry. Hereafter, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will affix its official seal and have the responsible person sign and certify it in order to ensure uniformity. Certifications from all other organizations will be considered invalid. This notice is hereby issued for your information and to instruct all factories to comply. Special notice is hereby given."</p>
<h3>High Tide Tomorrow Morning: The Moon Approaching, Great Attraction.</h3>
<p>According to predictions by the Zhaopu Bureau, 2:00 AM tomorrow, the 13th, will be the time when the moon releases the earth, with great attraction. On that day, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River at midnight, reaching between eleven feet and eight inches, only one foot more than the Bund embankment. The torrents will gurgle, and there will be a risk of overflowing the embankment. From then on, there will be continuous high tides in the Huangpu River, with the highest tides on the mornings and afternoons of the 15th, all above twelve feet, lasting until the 19th. At that time, low-lying roads will once again be greatly troubled by flooding. Around the 20th, the water level is expected to return to normal. However, there will still be large tides after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Traveler Describes His Experiences in Siberia: Soviet Military Vehicles Constantly Heading East, Germans Deeply Regret the War.</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, a Norwegian traveler who had just arrived in Shanghai via Siberia from London told a reporter yesterday (the 11th) that the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" are continuing to make rapid military preparations. Within the Soviet Union, hundreds of trains are transporting back and forth. We were delayed eighteen hours in Omsk because the train we were on repeatedly stopped at side tracks to wait for ammunition transport vehicles to pass us first. Trucks and trailers were transported in open freight cars, and tanks were covered with tarpaulins. Airplanes were packed in large wooden boxes, also covered with tarpaulins. Every ten minutes, a line of empty trains from the east passed us. It was clear that there were not enough locomotives, so each locomotive had to haul as many as eighty freight cars. Many hours before arriving at the "Manchu" border, train personnel entered each cabin and forced us to close the blinds. The Japanese authorities in "Manchu" also did this, but sometimes they only closed the blinds on one side, mainly to prevent us from seeing the airfield. The windows were not reopened until we reached Harbin. The traveler described what he saw in Germany and Poland, saying that when he passed through these two countries, the people were quite peaceful and life seemed normal. In Berlin, because he was a foreigner, he was supplied with whatever he wanted to eat. He traveled across Siberia with four Germans, who compared the quality of the butter used for the passengers' breakfast on the train with the butter that the German people received each week. He passed through Berlin on August 24th. The people there did not believe that war was coming. Those who traveled with him thought that even if war broke out, Britain would not fight. During his day in Berlin, all the Germans he met told him that they deeply regretted the idea of war. The situation in Britain was different. The people were very enthusiastic and obedient to the instructions issued by the authorities. There was no shortage of food, and life proceeded as usual.</p>
<h3>Female Spy Jiang Peiyu Executed in Zhejiang.</h3>
<p>Executed in a Certain Location. According to a statement issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Jiang Peiyu (also known as Jiang Qinbin, Wang Jiangshi, and using the alias Zhang Suzhen) was introduced to a certain party in Shanghai, and then introduced to a special agent organization stationed in Shanghai. The organization gave Jiang Peiyu 500 yuan in activity funds to conduct activities in Zhejiang. Jiang left Shanghai for Zhejiang on March 25th of this year, staying at Zhang Mingyan's home at No. 31 Shanting Street, Huangyan. She instructed Zhang to contact the Huangyan County Resistance and Defense Team and ordered him to draw a detailed map of Zhejiang Province to contribute to a certain party. She also instructed Liang Houshi to find a pilot to guide a certain party. The authorities discovered the matter and secretly arrested Jiang Peiyu and sent her to the Provincial Security Command for interrogation. After questioning, it was confirmed that Jiang Peiyu had dared to resist her own country during this period of resistance against Japan, which was extremely illegal. She was sentenced to death in accordance with the law and has been executed by firing squad at a certain execution ground to serve as a warning and to be widely publicized.</p>
<h3>After Hotels Increased Room Rates, Employees Demand Pay Raises.</h3>
<p>Since the hotel industry in this city increased room rates by 20% on September 1st, the employees of various hotels, because the management has not increased their salaries, find it difficult to maintain their livelihoods with their original income. Therefore, they demand a 30% pay raise, following the example of restaurants and eateries. Hotel employees are divided into two types: those who are paid a fixed wage and those who split profits. Those who are paid a fixed wage usually pay a deposit of 200-300 yuan, and their salary is only 30 yuan at most. Those who split profits add a small percentage to their accounts and split the profits with the management at a ratio of 40% to 60%, or half and half, but even then, they earn no more than 40 yuan. Now that the management has increased room rates, it is reasonable to raise the salaries of the employees as well. The management is discussing this matter in order to make a decision.</p>
<h3>German Resident's Murder of His Mistress: Forensic Appraisal Shows the Perpetrator Exhibited Signs of Neurasthenia.</h3>
<p>The case of German resident Heinemann, who killed his mistress, Miss Fashang (transliteration), with a razor on June 12th of this year due to a love affair, was investigated by the French Police and transferred to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution on charges of murder. After repeated trials by Judge Liao, the defendant initially confessed to the crime but then denied his statements. He was ordered to be returned to custody, and the investigation was rescheduled. Now, it is learned that during the rescheduling, a forensic appraisal revealed that the criminal, Heinemann, exhibited signs of neurasthenia. Yesterday, Judge Liao continued the trial of the case and ordered the defendant to be transferred to the detention center to await the submission of an examination report from the doctor hired by the defendant to the court before the trial is resumed.</p>
<h3>Overview of Public Parks in the Public Concession.</h3>
<p>Last month, summer and autumn flowers were planted in the Shanghai Municipal Council's parks and squares. A total of 1,301,066 branches of flowers and trees were transferred from the Shanghai Municipal Council's nursery to the various parks and squares. A green parrot was donated to the Zhaofeng Park Zoo by Mr. Brown, a Westerner. In addition, several other birds and animals were received. The daily work in the parks mainly consisted of park maintenance, such as grooming the lawns and repairing bamboo fences.

<h3>Silk Goods Internal Sales Turn Prosperous; Silk Stores Join the Guild; Issuance of Internal Sales Certificates Is Extremely Cautious; Hundreds of Cases Are Handled Daily</h3>
<p>Since the start of the military conflict, various places have successively become war zones, and various seaports have been blockaded, resulting in the interruption of domestic sales of national goods. Furthermore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that all national goods transported to the interior for sale must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the local chamber of commerce or trade association before they are allowed to be imported. The Shanghai silk industry trade association has more than 500 members, with the highest capital of 300,000 yuan and the lowest being more than 200 yuan. Most are concentrated in the central district, engaging in retail and wholesale. Due to the impact of the war, business has been quite sluggish. Now, due to the prosperous internal sales, such as the southwestern provinces, transported via coastal defense, and the various cities and counties along the two railways of Jinghu and Huhangyong, the large and small silk stores in Shanghai urgently need to transport goods to the interior. Therefore, they are importing goods in large quantities, waiting for the opportunity to transport them. However, all silk stores that transport goods to the interior must hold a certificate from the trade association, as well as the seal of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. In order to develop internal sales, the silk stores have been clamoring to join the guild and pay membership fees. Yesterday, inquiries with the Shanghai Silk Industry Trade Association revealed that the association issues hundreds of various certificates to members every day. Furthermore, for the sake of prudence, personnel are dispatched to investigate before issuing them, which are then sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for stamping and the signature of the person in charge.</p>

<h3>The Murder Case of Father An; Brought to Court for Interrogation Yesterday; Five Perpetrators, the Main Culprit Still at Large</h3>
<p>Father An, a French national and the director of the orphanage established by the Catholic Church in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai, was suddenly murdered by bandits on the 30th of last month. The perpetrators fled the scene. After the incident, the French police ordered all detectives to solve the case within a limited time, arrest the criminals, and punish them to the fullest extent of the law. Now, on the afternoon of the 9th of this month at 9:00 PM, Ju Bolu (25 years old), an accomplice of the perpetrators from Pudong, knowing that his crime was inescapable, surrendered himself to the St. Peter's Catholic Church at the intersection of Rue Luberan and Father Lou Road. The church notified the Lujiawan Central Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest and detain Ju for further investigation. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Now, it is heard that during the police interrogation, Ju Bolu confessed that at the age of eight, he entered the Tushanwan Catholic Church orphanage to learn a craft. Until recently, two months ago, he was expelled by the orphanage for laziness. On the 30th of last month, he and A, B, C, and D (names kept confidential), five people in total, went to the orphanage intending to rob money. While B, C, and D were on lookout outside, he and A entered Father An's bedroom, pretending to ask Father An if he could take in an orphan who would be brought in the next day. Taking the opportunity, A made a move and strangled Father An. He held down An's feet and tied them with rope, stuffing cotton in his mouth. They also intended to open the iron box to steal money, but they failed. They then opened the writing desk drawer and took 200 yuan in cash, most of which was taken by A. Then he and A fled together to the Hengwu area of Pudong. It happened to be raining heavily. In the dark night, they stayed overnight in a cowshed. The next day, he decided to return to Shanghai. He stayed in a inn for a few days. Thinking that he still had a wife, children, and elderly at home, and that he could no longer live that way, he went to the church to surrender himself. Currently, A is still in the Hengwu area, and so on. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Ju to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special Second Court. Judge Liao interrogated him. Yao, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case and stated that the accomplices still at large need to be arrested and requested a postponement for further investigation. Interrogating Ju, he admitted to participating in the murder of Father An. The court verified the confession and ordered a change of date for further questioning on the 30th of this month. The defendant was sent back to detention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Arrest Travelers at the Da Fang Hotel; Two Travelers Are Now Detained in the French Police Station</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, two plainclothes Japanese people suddenly came to the Da Fang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession and barged into rooms 157 and 159. They intended to forcibly arrest Li Rong in room 157 and Zhang Xinqiang in room 159. The hotel staff called the nearby patrol police, and both parties were taken to the police station. After a detailed interrogation by the chief, the two Japanese people claimed that Li and Zhang had just come here from a certain remote area and intended to engage in certain activities in Shanghai. They were ordered by their superiors to secretly arrest them. After hearing this, the chief asked the two Japanese people to provide evidence of Li and Zhang's crimes. The two Japanese people were ultimately unable to provide any. Currently, Li and Zhang can only be temporarily detained in the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Forging Voucher Coupons; Three Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Huang Hongquan, a Ningbo native who set up a cigarette stall on Qiwu Pulu in Hongkou, took the opportunity to entrust the Yongfeng Printing House at 701 Haining Road to print 10,000 forged one-cent voucher coupons for the Datong Fish Shop on Qiwu Pulu, 10,000 two-cent voucher coupons for the Jintai Fish Shop, and 5,000 one-cent voucher coupons, which were mixed and used in the market. The two fish shops found out the day before yesterday and reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Huang Hongquan and take him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him according to the law. The defendant admitted to the forgery without denying. The presiding judge verified the confession and sentenced Huang Hongquan to three years of imprisonment for forging securities. The six forged zinc plates and one forged stamp were all confiscated.</p>
<h3>The Second Landlord; Accused of Assault; Reached a Settlement as Ordered</h3>
<p>Zhu Suzhen, a woman from Suzhou, 25 years old, rented a pavilion room in the Friendship Women's Apartment at 8 Xingfu Lane, Rue Luberan. She entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Tribunal of the Special Second Court against the second landlord, Sun Zhang (51 years old, local) and her daughter, Sun Shiying (23 years old), for joint assault, requesting an investigation. It is claimed that the plaintiff rented the defendant's pavilion room. The rent had recently been increased by two yuan, totaling sixteen yuan. Now, they suddenly wanted to increase the rent by another two yuan. At 11:00 AM on the 4th of this month, the first defendant urged the collection of the rent for September, demanding that the newly added two yuan be paid together. At that time, the plaintiff refused, arguing that the first landlord had not increased the rent and the second landlord should not increase it without reason. The defendant then said that if she refused, she should move out immediately, otherwise she would lock the door. The plaintiff then wanted to call her husband, but the first defendant did not allow her to make the call, leading to a dispute. She was injured in the arm by being hit with the telephone receiver. The second defendant even stepped forward to help, requesting an investigation according to the law. According to the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Jiang. The plaintiff arrived with her lawyer and gave her statement. The defendants also arrived with their defense lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang. The first defendant admitted to the assault, stating that the reason was a dispute over the phone call, and that she was kicked in the abdomen. The second defendant also admitted to helping. They also filed a counterclaim for false accusation and assault. The court verified the confession and, considering the minor nature of the case, persuaded them to reach a settlement. The defendants apologized to the plaintiff. With the consent of both parties, a settlement was reached, and the respective lawsuits and counterclaims were withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Group of Suicides</h3>
<p>Qian Amao: Qian Amao, a native of Gusu, 31 years old, a lacquer worker, resided at 840 Gordon Road in western Shanghai. Due to economic pressure, he ingested poison last night at around 8:20 PM and committed suicide. After being reported to the police, he was taken to Baolong Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>
<p>Wang Shuxing: Wang Shuxing, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, recently stayed with his fellow villager Yao Amao at 44 Xing Shun North Lane, Remi Road. Due to unemployment and difficult living conditions, he had a moment of despair. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, he jumped off the roof of Yao's house and committed suicide, suffering internal injuries and breaking both arms and legs. He died on the spot.</p>
<p>Wang Zugen: Wang Zugen, a traveler from Jiangsu, 23 years old, was staying in room 217 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, a tea server discovered that he had taken sleeping pills and committed suicide. An ambulance was quickly called to rush him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The poisoning was severe, and his life was in danger.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhengsheng: Zhu Zhengsheng, a resident of 156, Lane 1238, Annan Road, suddenly had an argument with his wife over trivial family matters yesterday morning at around 1:00 AM. Afterward, Zhu secretly ingested poisonous liquid and committed suicide. After being discovered by his family, he was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. His life was in critical condition.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhao: Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, an old woman, Zhou Zhao, 58 years old, at 24 Yongshun Road, Broadway Road, in eastern Shanghai, suffered an unknown stimulus and suddenly had a desire to end her life.

<h3>Persuading to Purchase Cotton Yarn for Profit; Defrauding Huge Sums of Money; The Yang Brothers Are Blinded by Greed; Discovered the Fraud and Filed a Criminal Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Yang Xingling, Yuling, and Changling, three brothers from Wuxi, residing at 11, Lane 340, Yucha Qing Road, were repeatedly persuaded by Yin Renyi, who lived with them, to invest in the cotton yarn business, saying that the price of yarn was rising daily and profits would be high. The Yang brothers were swayed by this. On July 21st, they raised 1,500 yuan and entrusted Yin to purchase three pieces of yarn. Soon, Yin settled the accounts with them, making a double profit. Since then, they trusted Yin even more. Therefore, in a few days, Yin colluded with Liu Yongzhi of the Xinguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 42 Naxiangfen Lane and Hong Shenfu, who lived on the third floor of the Huimin Elementary School in Hongruili, Wenzhou Road, to use tricks and gradually obtain more than 20,000 yuan from the Yang brothers as the price of purchasing yarn and cloth. The profits and losses were initially settled every night. However, the Yang brothers were reaping huge profits and never suffered any losses. Until near the anniversary of August 13th, Yin suddenly used the excuse of martial law and the inability to pick up goods from the warehouse to stop settling accounts. The 15,000 yuan check from Shenfu Cotton Cloth Store was also found to have no deposit. It was then suspected that Yin and others were actually colluding with each other, using profit as bait at first, and then defrauding them of huge sums of money. The Yang brothers, having failed to negotiate with these people, have now hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Yin Renyi, Liu Yongzhi, Hong Shenfu, and others in the First Special District Local Court, recounting the facts in detail. In addition to the 10,125 yuan of profits that have been gradually recovered, there is still a shortage of 12,565 yuan, which clearly violates Article 339, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting that the case be summoned and punished. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng summoned them for questioning. The defendant Yin Renyi failed to appear. Liu and others also hired lawyers to defend themselves. After the court interrogated them, it ordered a change of date for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Potassium Cyanide Tipped into Rice; Cook Almost Poisoned to Death; Fortunately, the Maid Discovered It and Averted the Disaster; Zhao Changjin Was Arrested and the Admonition Was Changed to a Later Date</h3>
<p>Zhao Changjin (18 years old), a native of Yangzhou, worked as a partner in the Wubaokang Electrical Material Store at 18 Haikou Road. The relationship between the guest and the host was very good. For some reason, the day before yesterday at 4 pm, Zhao took advantage of the maid's lack of preparedness and secretly poured a bottle of poisonous potassium cyanide into the rice, intending to poison his master and all 31 staff members of the store. Fortunately, the maid Qu Wu discovered it and reported it to the owner who turned him over to the police station. This morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special Court and requested to be detained. Judge Feng presided over the court interrogation. The defendant confessed that he had no hatred with the owner and was really because his head was not clear, and muddledly poured the poisonous salt into the rice, asking the court president to be lenient. The court verified the confession and instructed that the case be adjourned for seven days for further questioning. The defendant will be examined by the court's forensic doctor to determine if he suffers from mental illness during the change of date. Sports News</p>
<h3>West League Football This Season; Interest Will Sharply Decline</h3>
<p>French merchants are difficult to form a team… The British army does not participate; each team is average… The annual meeting will be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>The curtain of the Shanghai football season has been unveiled last week. This week, there will be a battle between Donghua and St. Francis, which will not be slightly paused due to the war in Europe. The Shanghai Western Football Association has scheduled the annual meeting to be held at 5:15 PM tomorrow (Thursday) at the Shanghai Engineering Office General Assembly Hall at 220 Sichuan Road, to re-elect officials, and for other valley affairs. Although it has been decided that the league this season will proceed as usual, it has at least been affected to some extent. In terms of Group A, I am afraid that there will not be more than eight teams. Lido and Beixi Tong are still to be passed. The British army only has one team, Xifu Si, registered, but there are still problems with whether it can play. Withdrawing from the league is extremely likely. Some members of the French merchants will be conscripted. After all kinds of efforts, it is difficult to form a team. It is said that they will give up Group A, or form a team to participate in Group B, or Group C. As for the Russian generals among them, such as Robas Tofu, Shaker is quite ambitious to pull them into the team to reorganize. Whether Lido can cross-level is still uncertain. Donghua is mostly to promote new talents. Only Chen Hongguang has returned, and the rest of the Western teams, the Western Police, Portugal, and St. Francis are still the same, and are average. The Shanghai football scene can still be active. In order to imitate the complete suspension of the London Church, the fans can just have fun in the lack of ways.</p>
<h3>Finland Still Determined to Host Next Year's World Games</h3>
<p>(Haitong News Agency, Fenjing, 12th) Pihahe, a famous Finnish sports leader, issued a statement yesterday, forcefully saying that even if the European war is prolonged, the 1940 World Games should still be held as usual.

Frenkel, the chairman of the Fenjing Olympic Pairing Committee, also said that all World Games buildings can be completed on schedule, but the construction cost of the swimming pool, 32 million marks, is still subject to the approval of the Fenjing City Council.</p>
<h3>Handicap Tennis Charity Performance; Postponed for One Week</h3>
<p>The Handicap Tennis Championship, since it was decided that the Group A finals will be expanded into a charity performance, was originally scheduled to be held on the 16th and 17th of this month. Now, because it takes time to build the grandstand, and the invited masters have to participate in the grass court semi-finals at the end of this week, it has been decided to postpone it for one week, and it will be held on the 23rd and 24th of this month. Although the ticket price is high, the results are very good due to the efforts of Chen Qihao and his brother Qi Jun to promote sales, and it has exceeded 1,000 yuan. The Refugee Association sent a letter to Gao Huaide, the president of the Lido Sports Association, to give a prize. Mrs. Buli Sheng auctioned the balls, Mrs. Qiu Maosheng cut the ribbon, and the Lido Cup donated by the Lido Sports Association will be displayed in the window of the New New Company starting today.</p>

(9) The time students spend in class should not exceed that stipulated in the revised standards promulgated by the Ministry. Children's extracurricular and homework should be reduced compared to the general situation of previous schools, so that they have leisure time to engage in sports.</p>

<h3>Merchants Speculate and Profit Amidst the European War, Actually Hoarding Large Quantities of Medicines</h3>
<p>— (Huang Ziqiang)</p>
<p>Hoping to Use Domestically Produced Medicines with Equal Effectiveness, Hoping for New Pharmaceutical Industry to Invent Universal Medicines</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the German-Polish war, merchants with experience from the First World War were delighted to welcome this opportunity to make a fortune. Looking at the soaring prices of various commodities these past two days, they are leaping upwards at high speed, like mercury columns plunged into boiling water. According to reports, the stocks of metals, paints, woolens, and other goods are very substantial, and shipping between the Mediterranean and the Far East has not been interrupted. Ships from neutral countries are also importing goods as usual. If everyone can work together and maintain the general status quo, the European war should not have a significant impact on Shanghai for the time being. However, merchants, driven solely by profit, have not seen the actual situation of this European war and the situation in 1914, nor have they realized that China, in its time of crisis, needs every citizen to cooperate and work together to overcome the difficult situation. They are constantly looking for opportunities to make money. Therefore, those who own goods are reluctant to sell them easily and are hoarding even more. Their slogan is: any imported goods can be hoarded.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend of mine contracted a serious illness. The doctor prescribed an injectable medicine. After running to four or five pharmacies, all of them replied, "Out of stock, new stock not yet arrived." Later, I bought it at a small pharmacy, but the price was more than seven times what it was before the war. In addition to my astonishment, I chatted with the clerk. According to him, most Western medicines are produced in Germany, and some special medicines can only be obtained from Germany. After the outbreak of the European war, the industry experts have hoarded the medicines and refused to sell them. Some pharmacies, which usually import more goods, are also holding out for higher prices at this time. Therefore, several German medicines are no longer sold on the market.</p>
<p>Under the slogan that all imported goods can be hoarded, medicines that are closely related to human life are actually being hoarded!</p>
<p>Incompetent doctors kill people, but good medicines save lives. Now, those with long sleeves and good dancing skills are hoarding life-saving medicines, indirectly becoming murderers. Besides sighing, we don't even have the courage to curse!</p>
<p>However, since humans are made up of cells, who can absolutely guarantee that they will not get sick? In addition to taking good care of themselves, for those living on the "isolated island," at least, within the limits of what is possible, I would like to offer a humble suggestion:</p>
<p>Nowadays, most doctors have a habit of prescribing foreign medicines in their prescriptions as if it were not fashionable enough otherwise. Indeed, as the clerk in the small pharmacy said, some special medicines must rely on foreign countries. However, some medicines recently invented by the new pharmaceutical industry are often equivalent in effectiveness to imported goods. Therefore, unless the symptoms are absolutely severe, I hope that doctors will try to prescribe domestic goods with equal effectiveness.</p>
<p>At the same time, many doctors in the new pharmaceutical industry who are buried in laboratories should not only focus on yeast preparations and medicines for venereal diseases, but should expand their research spirit to various universal medicines. Investors should also encourage doctors who have made inventions.</p>
<p>By extension, other industries should also do their best to exert the power of local resources!</p>
<p>Speculative merchants believe that this is an opportunity to make a fortune, but it is also a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. If the capital used for hoarding can be used as development capital, it is what we pray for!</p>
<h3>Publication of "Mechanical Poetry"</h3>
<p>Starting from the next issue, this journal will publish Mr. Ruhui's "Mechanical Poetry," which contains anecdotes of various scientific inventions and the lack of understanding of science by people of that era, which can elicit a smile. Therefore, it can be regarded as a scientific anecdote, or an amusing tale. However, the space in the Spring and Autumn section is limited, so whether we publish it in each issue or in installments will depend on the situation. The Editorial Department</p>
<h3>How to Resolve Rent Disputes</h3>
<p>— Mang Mang</p>
<p>No matter how many words you use, you can't write enough about the housing tricks on this isolated island. Landlords arbitrarily and confidently demand "ten years' rent in advance" for newly built houses or add several times the rent on old properties. Those with cleverer tactics will also use tricks such as "renovating the house and asking tenants to move out within a limited time," using bamboo fences as a threat, and then automatically demolishing them in the end. These are the most gentlemanly actions of the landlords. As a result of such cleverly established pretexts for raising rents, it is not the second landlords who suffer, but some third tenants whose lives are about to be thrown into a panic.</p>
<p>According to a recent report, various public groups are calling on landlords not to raise rents without reason. This is indeed a voice of justice! Naturally, the seriousness of this problem has long been noticed. I remember that there used to be an organization called the Rent Dispute Mediation Association, but in the end, it failed to have a great effect because the organization could not penetrate into the various alleys. If the voices of justice from various public groups do not have concrete measures to be implemented based on the needs of the situation, then no matter how loud the calls are, the landlords will still turn a deaf ear.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, since rent disputes occur in one corner or another, if a single organization tries to manage all of Shanghai, it is bound to fail because it cannot be universally implemented. The most appropriate solution is for various public groups to convene relevant parties (including the concession authorities, the Real Estate Association, and various road associations) and let the public opinion of the meeting generate several fair principles. In the future, these principles may even serve as the basis for laws, so that all rent disputes can be resolved based on these principles, or let the law adjudicate fairly.</p>
<p>However, when discussing these principles, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points: (1) Rents that have been increased since "August 13th" cannot be increased again; (2) Rent increases cannot exceed x percent; (3) Landlords must state sufficient reasons for rent increases; (4) Houses built within a few years cannot be renovated arbitrarily; (5) Second landlords cannot arbitrarily increase rents to make money, unless they themselves do not pay rent for a room.</p>
<p>After this meeting generates the principles, it can be dissolved, leaving at most one or two staff members in case of need. After that, the more important organization is the establishment of rent arbitration committees in each alley, organized by the main landlord, second landlord, and third tenant. All disputes will be handled based on the rent mediation principles. If they are compatible, they will be implemented; if they are not, they will be adjudicated publicly. The problem can be easily solved. The reason for establishing organizations separately in each alley is to handle matters locally, quickly, and easily to obtain practical results.</p>
<p>This is a serious social problem that can only be resolved through the most just and peaceful means. All stubbornness can be subdued under the public opinion of the masses. The above method can be implemented, as for whether it is effective or not? It all depends on whether the executor handles it properly or not.</p>
<h3>Questions about the New Recipe</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I recently read Mr. Gu Zhong's letter of September 8th with his opinion on the new recipe, which meets the needs of the times. The method is to mix ten ounces of flour with six or eight ounces of bean dregs, which is sweet and delicious. However, I still do not understand its cooking method. I assume it must be cooked, but after mixing the bean dregs, must water be added? Is it spread out like a pancake? Or steamed, like bread? Please ask Mr. Gu Zhong to detail his method and answer with your pen. Sincerely, Zhu Zhuocheng</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Accomplish the Medical Elite, Thinking of Expanding the Village and Establishing Daycares</p>
<p>The story continues with the He sisters, upon seeing Zhu Airen, telling her: They received a telegram from their father, saying that a senior colleague would be arriving in Shanghai on Monday to meet them and discuss the silk weaving factory. They would not be able to go to Freedom Village on Sunday. Zhu Airen also told them that she had just received Jin Danyu's wedding invitation, which was set for next Sunday in Shanghai. She had already agreed to attend the wedding, and she could not miss it out of sisterly affection. Although Zhu Airen was very busy with her medical practice, she would take time out to attend that day since it was a Sunday, and it would not interfere with her work. She also sent a wedding invitation to Old Doctor Zhang, but Old Doctor Zhang might not go. Although it was a Sunday, it was not convenient for both of them to go. Later, they discussed whether to go early on Monday or on Saturday afternoon? They decided to go on Saturday afternoon. First, Danyu wanted them to go on Saturday, and they didn't know why. Second, Airen also advocated going on Saturday afternoon because she had some other things to deal with in Shanghai. Most of these matters were related to the hospital, and she was representing Old Doctor Zhang. Old Doctor Zhang was a member of the World Medical Association, and Shanghai also had a branch of the World Medical Association. However, Old Doctor Zhang entrusted many matters to Zhu Airen, saving him effort when she could. However, the World Medical Association had very strict qualifications; one could not become a member unless they had been practicing medicine for more than ten years. Therefore, although Zhu Airen was a Doctor of Medicine from the United States, she was temporarily unable to become a member of this association. Zhu Airen had not been to Shanghai for a long time, and she was planning to take care of some matters while attending the wedding. One of these matters was to represent Old Doctor Zhang in visiting Mrs. Suliya. It turned out that Mrs. Suliya and Old Doctor Zhang were old friends, and she greatly praised Old Doctor Zhang's Women's and Children's Hospital and Nursery for their good work. She knew that they had no foundation before, and now they have achieved such success, it was all due to painstaking efforts. She had said so not only in front of Jin Danyu, but also in front of other friends. She had hinted that if Old Doctor Zhang needed her help in any way, she could help some. She had even told Jin Danyu that she wanted to come to Anle Town to visit when she had time. Mrs. Suliya was a member of the American bourgeoisie and could use her surplus economy to make up for the deficiencies of the East. However, Old Doctor Zhang had always had sufficient economic resources for running the Women's and Children's Hospital and Nursery. If he were to start a new business, he would have to raise funds separately. (181)</p>
<h3>Private Arbitrage</h3>
<p>— (Wang Hengtang)</p>
<p>Wealthy people in the interior who flee to the Shanghai Concession to escape the war want to bring their huge fortunes or bank deposits with them, but that is impossible. Because the government in the interior prohibits the carrying of cash out of the country, limiting it to a maximum of 500 yuan per person, in order to prevent capital from fleeing into the occupied areas. However, cunning merchants often use arbitrage methods to make the capital from the interior flow into the occupied areas.</p>
<p>For example, Shaoxing produces most of the rice wine, silk, tea, silk fabrics, tin foil, and the like. The total annual export volume is valued at more than 10,000,000 yuan. In principle, the proceeds from these goods should be remitted back to Shaoxing, but they do not do so. They find a merchant in Shanghai who buys these goods and ask them not to remit the money, but to find a wealthy merchant locally to withdraw money from the bank as a solution. The government agencies in the interior do not pay attention to this method. Even if they inquire, it seems that it is a matter of business between merchants in the interior, and there is no suspicion of remitting funds to the occupied area or capital escaping. But in fact, in the blink of an eye, the property of wealthy people in the interior has been remitted to Shanghai invisibly. As for the arbitrage spread, paying cash in the interior and receiving cash in Shanghai requires a fee of 150 or 160 yuan per thousand yuan, which is a huge loss. However, wealthy people do not care about this and try desperately to arbitrage. After obtaining money in Shanghai, they can engage in speculative activities such as buying foreign exchange and hoarding grain, and they do not care about the lives of others.</p>
<p>Therefore, this cunning method of arbitrage must be prohibited. It can not only consolidate the financial institutions in the rear, allowing capital to be used for projects that benefit rural areas or construction, but also reduce the number of wealthy merchants in Shanghai who engage in speculation, stabilizing the lives of the people. It is best for the local authorities in the production areas to control freight, verify and register the quantity and price of goods, and order them to be returned in full, not allowing mutual acceptance. If it can be handled in this way, it can prevent the depletion of funds in the interior, which is the fundamental way to stop leaks, far better than checking travelers and limiting the private carrying of cash, which is a superficial policy.</p>

<h3>After Listening to "The Tale of Qiu Xiang"</h3>
<p>— Lord Ke Yun Lou</p>
<p>Mr. Nan Tiesheng, known as the Mei Lanfang of Hankou, has been famous for a long time. He made his debut in Shanghai, performing "The Tale of Qiu Xiang" on the first day to meet us. After listening, I returned home. The autumn lamp was quiet and cool, so I recorded the outline for this column.</p>
<p>The plot of "The Tale of Qiu Xiang" is very simple. The scene where Qiu Xiang gathers firewood in the suburbs and meets the scholar Li Chunfa is more compact. That evening, Furong Cao cross-dressed as a young man to play Li Chunfa. His performance was generous and had a restrained style. As one who usually plays a female role, it is difficult to achieve this unless one has long-term cultivation. I listened quietly and watched. Apart from feeling that his accent slightly revealed his true color when ending a phrase, he completely shed his old habits.</p>
<p>Tiesheng played the role of Qiu Xiang. The three sections of "Second Huang Slow Beat," "Shake Beat," and "Southern Bangzi" he sang are most thought-provoking. There are many sections here. Every beat and eye, in places of rise and fall, should be tight and not relaxed. If we let it go a little, it will be gone in a flash, and cannot be recovered. Wanhua's singing can stir people's emotions because of this. Tiesheng sings in a flat and rhythmic way, manipulating freely, tightly and methodically. When receiving his eyes and releasing his voice, he follows the rules, honoring Mei's style and never revealing any laziness. His voice is sweet. Listening to it is no different from drinking nectar. His deficiency is that his stage steps are frivolous and lack stability, losing the style of grace and dignity. When he met Li Chunfa, when he was surprised, happy, and shy, wanting to speak, his expression was too enthusiastic. When he scratched his head and played with his wet nurse, the "shake beat" was just finishing its ending sound. In a hurry, he suddenly dropped three eyes. This is truly the fundamental taboo of a main character singing opera, the so-called false voice and off-key. It is said that if we emphasize expressions, we must not ignore singing. Then "sound and expression" can move the audience's emotions, creating a good impression. The musician did not relax at all that evening. "The three eyes" were still pulled through, fully revealing the seriousness of the instrumental support. It is especially fortunate for Tiesheng to have found someone like that.</p>
<p>In short, Tiesheng, as a "son of a general," does not seek officialdom and honor, but has a passion for opera and dedicates himself to art. "He violates the family style," opposing tradition and has a different future. This is what we should sympathize with.</p>
<h3>Decoration of Kunqu Opera Su Wu</h3>
<p>— Qiusheng</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Xiao Cang made a review of Kunqu Opera "Looking at Hometown" in this journal. I feel that there are a few things that must be told to Mr. Xiao Cang, so I wrote this article. Perhaps the editor will not think it is meddlesome?</p>
<p>First, the clothes worn by Su Wu, according to the old rules of Kunqu Opera, must have an orange "loyal minister's coat" in addition to the blue robe. This "loyal minister's coat" seems to exist only in Kunqu Opera. It has not been seen in Peking Opera. It is shaped like a vest, but the shoulder part is slightly wider, almost reaching the upper arm, very similar to a type of summer coat worn by modern women today, but made of orange plain satin. I have watched Ni Chuan Yue perform this play several times before, and he wore this coat. I don't know whether Mr. Xiao Cang saw Zheng Chuan Jian wear this coat in his performance this time. Perhaps the costumes have not been complete in recent years and were simply omitted. However, breaking conventions is not good. Also, there are only three people who wear this loyal minister's coat in Kunqu Opera. One is Fan Li (played by Xiaosheng) in "Yiyang Ma" from "The Story of Washing Silk," showing that he is suffering "national disaster" in the stone room. The second is Yang Jisheng in "Zhan Yang" from "The Story of Singing Phoenix." The martyrdom of Duke Zhongmin is truly a matter of supreme loyalty throughout the ages. The third is Su Wu in "Herding Sheep."</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Xiao Cang said that the scepter held by Su Wu has only one beard in Kunqu Opera, while there are more in Peking Opera. I do not know that there are also certain rules in Kunqu Opera. According to "Herding Sheep," which is a Southern Drama written by a Yuan person, the full version has long been lost. Today, there are only the handwritten copies of the actors. The selections in various music scores and other books also do not exceed ten scenes. The "Suzhou Small Class" can sing a total of four scenes: "Little Forcing," "Herding Sheep," "Lost Courtesan," and "Looking at Hometown." The scepter held when performing "Little Forcing" has four or five beards. "Herding Sheep" has one or two fewer, "Lost Courtesan" has even fewer, and only one is left for "Looking at Hometown." This is to show the earliness of the time and has a deeper meaning.</p>
<p>The first time I watched these four scenes was still in the "New Yuefu" era. I remember that Zheng Chuan Jian played "Little Forcing," Shi Chuan Zhen played "Herding Sheep" and "Lost Courtesan," and Ni Chuan Yue played the last scene, "Looking at Hometown." The four scenes were performed in a row, and the actor playing Su Wu changed three times, and the voice became louder and louder, making the audience more and more excited. I still remember that Zhao Chuan Jun played Li Ling, Zhou Chuan Zheng played Wei Lu, and Bao Chuan Duo played the "Master" Su Wu saw in his dream in the "Herding Sheep" scene. I can't remember the others. Later, I watched "Looking at Hometown" many times, "Little Forcing" fewer times, and "Herding Sheep" and "Lost Courtesan" only once. Now, Chuan Zhen has passed away, and Chuan Yue has gone far away. It is impossible to watch these four plays in a row again. I am filled with emotion when I think about it.</p>
<h3>Drama Arts Society Revives "Shanghai Nights"</h3>
<p>"Shanghai Nights," the first play with the theme of isolated island life, has been well received by all walks of life since it was performed by the Shanghai Drama Arts Society at the "Xuan Palace Theater" last month, due to the realism of the play's theme and the efforts of the performance. The literary and art circles once praised it as "the poetic history of Shanghai in the past two years." However, the performance period was only one week at the time, and many audience members did not have a chance to see it. Recently, the Drama Arts Society authorities received numerous letters urging a revival, so they decided to postpone the originally scheduled "World of Lies" and revive "Shanghai Nights" for one star first (starting from the tenth) to meet the audience's demands.</p>
<p>The cast of this revival is the same as last time and has not been changed. The only problem is Lan Lan. According to the advertisement in the newspaper, Lan Lan plays "Cuixi" in "Lafei" and "Sunrise." "Sunrise" starts on the 9th, and "Shanghai Nights" starts on the 10th. In fact, there is a conflict. However, Lan Lan is A for "Cuixi" in "Lafei," and Bai Yan is B, so there may not be a problem.</p>
<p>Mei Lingchun, the old man in "Shanghai Nights," was originally played by Wang Jixu. In the last performance, Wang Jixu became ill after playing for two days due to excessive excitement. Later, he was replaced by Sudan. This time, Wang Jixu has recovered from his illness and loves to come back to the stage.</p>
<p>"Wang Xifeng" Gu Lanjun and her sister Lijun</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Separation and Reunion of Wang Keqin and Zhang Xun</p>
<p>At that time, he commanded tens of thousands of undisciplined people. The only talented person was Wan Mu Shi, and among the martial officers, the only one who could be considered was Zhang Wensheng. When the Qing Dynasty was coming, there were two famous gang leaders (that is, leaders of the Green Forest) in the Xuhai area, one called White Face Wang San and the other Rolling Dragon. It is said that Zhang Wensheng (Zi Xingwu) was the Rolling Dragon of that year. Eight or nine out of ten of Pigtail Marshal's subordinates were bandits who had been recruited. If there was no old Pigtail Marshal there to lead them, it would be difficult to make these wild people sincerely submit. Coincidentally, Wensheng was the same as the Pigtail Marshal in not forgetting the kindness he had received. His loyalty to the Pigtail Marshal was the same as the Pigtail Marshal's loyalty to the Qing Dynasty. Zhang Dong has always had a habit of scolding contests. A scolding contest seems a little more serious than joking. Generally, people in low-level society often like to play with people by scolding. As long as the other party can scold playfully and freshly, even if it hurts his parents and ancestors, he is happy to slap his butt and spin around, not blaming others at all. The Pigtail Marshal has had this kind of addiction since he was a child. It seems that he can't eat if he doesn't get scolded for a day. However, now that he has a high position, who among these subordinates dares to joke with him and have a scolding contest? However, the only one who can play with him by scolding is Rolling Dragon. Some people say that when the first Han Lord launched a large-scale campaign against Wu to avenge Guan Zhang, the ministers tried to persuade him not to listen. Kongming sighed and said, "If Xiaozhi were here, he would be able to stop the Lord from going east, so as not to fall into danger." Fa Zheng's position and reputation were far worse than Zhuge Liang's, but he was the only one who could stop the Lord from going east, and he was also believed by Kongming. It is said that the first Han Lord and Fa Xiaozhi often joked. Joking and scolding contests are half true and half false, both true and false. False can be turned into true, and true can be regarded as false. Even if Fa Zheng annoyed the Lord and retorted a few words, the first Han Lord wanted to punish him, but he was used to joking in the past. It was not true, nor false. In the end, there was no way but to let him go. Originally, Han Gao and the first Han Lord were both from very low backgrounds and had been living with commoners for a long time. So even though they were emperors, they still enjoyed it. Zhang Wensheng and the Pigtail Marshal started scolding each other as soon as they met. The Pigtail Marshal was unhappy for a day if he was separated from him. Sometimes, in front of many people, Wensheng was embarrassed to make trouble with him, so he had to provoke Wensheng and start scolding first. Don't look down on them for not having any rules. However, the Pigtail Marshal's restoration failed in the end, but he did not die a tragic death, and a part of the Anwu Army was still retained and did not suffer a complete defeat. This was also due to Wensheng's scolding contests with the Pigtail Marshal. (99)</p>
<h3>Brief News from the Art Scene</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Society will soon revive "The Beginning of Man," with Liu Qiong specially invited to guest star as Zhang Bonan.</p>
<p>Various companies are writing historical drama scripts, including: "The Tale of the Wandering Swordsman" directed by Wu Wenchao and written by Sun Jing, "The Legend of the White Snake" directed and written by Yang Xiaozhong (Guohua also plans to film this), and "The Sorrow of the Fragrant Concubine" directed by Fang Peilin (originally "Magistrate Qiao's Chaotic Matchmaking," the script was lost).</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhi said, "Wu Yonggang is writing the script for 'The Biography of Martyrs.'" Wu Yonggang said, "I am writing about Yue Fei. The so-called 'Biography of Martyrs' means both heroic and martyred."</p>
<p>Lu Ming's contract with Yi Hua is about to expire and will not be renewed; he has already signed a contract with Guohua. The patrons, Mr. and Mrs. Chen Kengran, have a package deal contract with Yi Hua, so there is naturally no problem. They will also join Guohua together. It is also heard that Chen Kengran's debut film is "Du Shiniang Sinks the Treasure Chest in Anger," scheduled to begin filming on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>It is said that Wu Cun has a strange habit when writing scripts: he refuses to answer the phone. Doctor Ru is currently rewriting "The Adulterous History of Su San," and all incoming calls are handled by Mrs. Wu on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Gu Lan Jun Suffers a Severe Case of Hives – "Wang Xifeng" Faces Another Setback – Charity Tea Dance Appearance Cancelled</h3>
<p>— Silver Thread</p>
<p>Miss Gu Lanjun's recent films have mostly been grand historical productions. Following "Diao Chan" and "Wu Zetian," the film "Wang Xifeng's Havoc in the Ningguo Mansion" is now awaiting the completion of one final large set piece before it is finished. Her next new work is scheduled to be "Red Thread Steals the Box," which may be personally directed by Zhang Shankun. In mid-June, Miss Gu suffered from a severe fever due to overwork filming in the summer heat, and her work was suspended for a long time. After she recovered, she reluctantly returned to the set, hoping to rush to complete the film and then rest. However, after filming for a few days, she unexpectedly caught a cold due to physical weakness, and her body suddenly broke out in numerous hives, with her face also showing slight swelling. "Wang Xifeng" has suffered another setback as a result, causing the film set work to be suspended again since the day before yesterday. The charity tea dance hosted by the Refugee Relief Association, which was scheduled to be held at the Paramount Ballroom yesterday, had originally invited her to cut the ribbon, but she could only postpone it, which inevitably detracted from the event.</p>
