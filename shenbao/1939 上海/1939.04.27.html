<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本策動偽組織的排外運動</h3>
<p>日本在中國的佔領區域內，新近策動一種反英法美的排外運動。日前京滬兩地，都曾發現各種中西文反英法的傳單和標語；僞組織所出版的各種報紙，也一致對英法發出攻訐的言論。據日昨路透電訉，這種排外運動，業已蔓延到日軍佔領下的其他各地，——安慶市各商店的英貨，且已在排外口號下，盡被搜去焚燬。並傳北平日本特務機關曾撥出五十萬元，作爲反英美的宣傳費用。這種僞裝的排外運動的發展，確是非常值得國際人士注意的。</p>
<p>在過去二十二個月的中日戰爭中，日本從未放棄過排斥歐美在華勢力的工作，爲甚麼這决却要發動大規模的反英法美運動？而且彰明顯著地發縱指示僞組織來實行呢？這種積極的加緊的破壞歐美在華權益的行動，恰於戰事進展到這個時候才來實行，這中間自然含有幾個重大的原因：第一，日本對華作戰二十二個月已經弄得民窮財盡，而近來英美諸國對華的積極援助，更足以促成中國「抗戰必勝」的形勢。所以她要利用歐洲現時局勢正在緊張的機會，發起這個排外運動，來對歐美民治國家示威；一方面當然想藉此威脋各國，不要再行援助中國；同時還打算利用這種手段來迫使各國，勸令中國屈服求和，以作爲濘止徘外運動的交換條件。</p>
<p>其次，日本為减輕各國的　難起見，她策動僞組織起來排外，便可以假借華人的名義，來收實際的效果。她儘可以在國際問宣稱，排斥歐美的運動，只是中國的民意表現。這樣，像過去由日人親手出面，毀壞歐美各國在華的產業，危害她們在華官吏僑民的生命，以及封鎖長江與珠江的交通，禁止外人在淪陷區域的經營貿易，等事所引起的一切歐美各國的抗議，都可以推諉避免了。她現在旣是假借華人的名義，來破壞歐美各國的權益，自可以將這些責任完全推諉在華人身上，而實際的利益却由佔領者的地位，自己去享受。她知道以現時英法美等國家和中國國民政府的正常外交關係親睦如故，自不會同僞組織發生外交關係，自然也無由提出抗議。這樣，除非英美等國決定以武力保護她們的權益外，日本便可以狠輕易的很巧妙的完成她那「遠東新秩序」的迷夢了。</p>
<p>除了上述兩大原因外，日本想藉此以離間中國和歐美各國的友誼，自然也是一個重要的企圖。不過這種把戲的內慕，歐美各國的明眼人士，沒有不深知是由日本導演的。試想在日本佔領區域中的中國人民，只是在愴刺下面過活，那裏還有什麽眞正「民意」表現？如果眞正民意可以表現，爲甚麼不去反對製造血腥氣味的强暴，反而要排斥渺不相干的歐美勢力？足見這種離間中國和歐美各國友誼的伎倆，也只是淺薄無聊，有誰能受她的蠱惑呢？</p>
<p>至於想藉此引起中國一般人民反英美各國的情感，則中國人民日在轟炸之下生活，「敵乎友乎」的區分，也早已有鐵一般的事實可以證明。再也用不着宣傳運動了。看來日本唆使僞組織實施的排外運動，還是威脅歐美各國在華權益，和離問中外相互的情感成分居多。雖然英美各國人士決不會中日本的陰謀詭計，但這裘却有一點可以注意的：便是日本想要獨覇遠束的企圖，更因此事而愈益顯明了。歐美各民治國家，現時正在進行反侵略的陣綫，對於日本這種假借華人名義侵害各國權益的排外運動，不知又將以怎樣實際有效的方法來對付呢？</p>
<p>修水　圍攻武寗之華軍、仍據有茶坪坳·原竹尖毛狗嶺、居高臨下、日軍完全受華軍控制、因屢圖進犯、迄不獲逞、乃於昨日復由七里山向華軍反攻、仍被擊退、其犯華軍左翼之日軍、一小部因冒險深入、經華軍抄襲斷後、不及退却、全部殲滅、獲輕機槍二挺、步槍二十一支、及一部軍用品、大部仍潰退七里山一帶、與華軍相持、（二十六日電）</p>

<p>（重慶）華中前綫之華軍、自通山向東推進、據已收復大畈、華軍現繼續向南昌前進、彼等並向奉新及靖安進襲、蓋華軍收復上述兩地、向東進展、從而切斷南潯鐵路、予日軍之交通錢以重大之打擊、華方發言人稱、渠信日方集重軍於綏遠平漢等地、綠一旦歐洲發生戰事、上項區域、卽成爲將來戰事之根據地、或可成爲響應歐洲某某國家示威之中心點、惟假定歐洲並不發生戰事、則上項區域、將取守勢而不進攻、（二十六日美聯社電）</p>

<p>自由談英駐德大使的返任  茂烈　　姑不問英國駐德大使漢特森應吾在這時返任，而他返任時所携帶的「直率之　文」，却可以使我們注意。據說，這牒文的內容是「希求和平」，同時也差不多是「警告」。這眞有些滑稽了。　　希求和平是向人表示好意的，警告則至少有一些恐嚇的性質。希特勒又不是呆子或小孩，那裹會在糖果的利誘和皮鞭的威逼之下，俯首聽命呢？這徑用意，這種措詞，要說不是滑稽，又是什麼？　　昨天我就說過，原來漢特森離任的理由，現在已經加以粉飾、變作毫無用意了，現在英國政府誠恐英德關係，陷於僵局——尤其在希特勒於本月二十八日演說之後，有此可能——，那就不得不呌漢特森從早返任，彌此缺陷，至於返任而携带一牒文，則我以爲希求和平也好，警吿也好，明知其無用，不過强自解嘲，用作返任的理由耳。　　返任之後將如何呢？當然也不會有什麼新鮮花樣玩出來。離仟時的示威方式，旣已成爲平常的行動，此後兩國的往來，還不是和平常一樣：一方面儘管百般陳說，與虎謀皮，一方面儘管充耳不聞，我行我我素。早知今日，悔不當初；旣有今日這樣的返任，則昔日那樣的離任，也許正所謂多此一舉吧！這樣的僕僕往來，似乎也只可以當作某種滑稽吧：像煞有介事，其實一毫無介事！　　我說這話，當然毫無近期的意思。而且我也很知道他們的苦衷，有不得不敢這種作風的原因。我這樣說，不過使一般人能夠了解，這一次事件的內容，也許眞正不過如此，不要過份筑視這一個「希求和平」或「警告」，以爲牠會有什麼成就；同時，我還是希望英國政府，在這一方面的虛與委蛇之外，在另一方面的反侵略同盟，允共和蘇聯切實合作，這樣的工作，更加會加緊趕上。　　張伯倫雖然還在說：「漢氏之返任，將可表示政府之政策，並無改變，更非軟化」，我們雖然也予以相當的信任，以爲是山衷之言，然而我們總覺得他的「無改變」和「非軟化」，實在還不够，大有加强共力量的必要！葬  劉蘭　　從天邊扯起了廣大的夜幔，遮掩住整個的莽原。穹蒼像片黑茫茫的海，不見一顆星，沒有半牙月。都沉沒於海底了。冷淸，寧闊，幽謐，只有夜寒在溜動。　　這兒曾是散放着芬芳的豐饒的原野，金黃的稻穗抖動着豐實的波浪。淸晨和傍晚，茅舍的頂上冒起縷縷靑色的炊烟，慢慢混進乳白的朝霧裏，絳紅的暮　中。潺潺的流水繞着人家。是甯靜的，和平的鄉村　　如今，靜悄悄躺着的是頹垣，是碎瓦。坎坷的土地噴發着霉爛味，血腥氣。天籟也似悲鳴。世界埋在死亡的重壓裏　　一羣黑影蠕蠕地朝這兒移動，像條小蛇，固執地爬着。終於停留下來，憇息正小溪傍。的摸有三十多個漢子。揹着雜色的槍技，三八，盒子砲；穿着各樣的服裝，軍服，短褂；有着不同的臉膛，方的，圜的。但，人心却不是「各如其面」，信念，意志把弟兄們鎔鑄成一塊鋼，鬥爭是鐵砧，捶鍊得更純，更堅了。　　「死了。」隊屍的兩位弟兄放下拙陋的担架床，摸摸傷者，吐出這兩個簡捷的字。語調悒鬱而低沉。流過夜空，這消息扭扯着每個人的臉，起着悲哀的痙　。愴痛駐在全隊人的心頭，如夕陽中鳥鴉棲於塔頂，但非絢爛的黃昏，而是蒼茫的深夜。豁然一聲黑色的扉門開了，一捲舌，吞下一個頑强的靈魂，整日與死亡戲嬸者。　　隊伍籠罩着在靜寂裏，人們都不言語。三個同志默默地掘着抗，一鏟一鏟的挖下去，像是削着人們自己的心。　　料峭的夜風，摩挲着面頰，如調皮的不知名的小蟲似的是使人沉沉欲醉的季節。這夥漢子却依然像怪石般的獃着。過度的悲痛麻痺了人的感覺。　　殉難的戰士在六十多隻眼睛肅然的注視下，回到土地中去。埋葬了。憤恨在活着的人的胸中燃燒，復仇的火花迸裂在心頭。　　「今天的一塲戰鬥犧牲了一位同志。夥伴的陣亡，固然要使我們難過，但犧牲却是不可避免的。我們要有勇氣面對死亡。自由和解放是耍用血去換的。爲了民族的永存，我們就不該吝惜個人的生命。×同志的死是光榮的，偉大的。」隊長壓抑着目己的情感，一字一句的說，有力地，堅足地。「我們應該用更頑强，更持久的抗爭來紀念死難的同志！」　　心上的白鴿在鼓翼，要從涳子裏飛出來。結尾的一句話挑撥了白鴿的翅膀，逗起飛意　　深沉的夜量中，人影又向前蠕動，終於消失在無盡的夜色裏。　　遠天有尖銳的槍聲劃破長夜的寂寥。偶然的心情  楊彥岐　　根據美學的理論上說，美的製造的全部過程可以用四個階段表出來：印象，表現，審美的快感，和事實的繙爲現象。文學的美，似乎有點捉摸不定，任何理論都套不上去；可是我們却始終不能不承認所謂文學的美，至少也有一個印象的階段。　　由於這種印象，又可以使我們稍爲進一步，探到作者的心情。一個美的景色，一樁美的事實，或者一件美的物體，要印上一顆有感應能力的心，才會製造一幅美的畫，或者一篇美的文章。英國詩人盛廉華滋華斯曾經把美和眞理混成一樣東西，就是中國古代文人騷客，也往往分不淸美麗和眞理。其實美麗是一個環，眞理也是一個環，兩個環套在一起，當然不能分開；雖然是兩個環，可是很容易弄成一樣東西。所以，一直到現在，還不能磨滅這種感覺。　　有美，就必有醜。美是出諸有感應能力的心，醜是出諸沒有感應能力的心。沒有感應能力，說得妤一點，是缺少美的表現力；說得壞點，是屍首上施以溫柔的撫摩；死者已經冷了硬了，那會覺得撫摩的好感呢？吃魚要吃新鮮的，讀文章不要讀公式。這兩件事勉强還算相像。　　心靈旣是麻木的東西，要活也活不了。但是有本事者，也會「偶然」的發發神經病，來一下「頓悟。」　　天才有沒有，不敢說！就像天下神童的不神，天才實在也沒有眞的。如果有，那便是偶然發起神經病的頓悟者。也許算是好運臨門，吉星高照；順筆而書，便會有不可遏制的「偶然的心情」來供給材料。說是値得佩服，還欠尊敬。　　對一件事物，對一絲回憶，或竟對一陣幻想的烟霧，不會偶然成以。只會偶然看到或者偶然想到，而引起心底的反應，慢慢溶化，慢慢洗鍊；那末傑作才會從筆下紙上劃出來，才會在高天厚地之間建立下美麗的文學石碑。　　人人有自己的見解，人人有自己的情感；自己也正應該尊重自己的見解，尊重自己的情感。要尊重，自然先得把見解和情感在腦子裏磨鍊得精細有光，才够資格被尊重。可是有「偶然的心情」的信徒，從來沒有留心自己過腦筋的作川，只知道「偶然」的來幾下「驚人表現」，（我差一點要寫驚人表論」。）算是出風頭固然可以，算是替自己英雄迭時勢也未嘗不可。些微心情，希望能够驚大動地，打翻太平洋，坍倒希馬拉雅山，而讓自己這位頂天立地的大英雄，一手抓起高爾基，一脚踏倒魯迅，一口氣吹出萬丈光芒。　　「漸悟」也許是笨伯的玩意兒；但「頓悟」是吾能够眞實存在呢？就是存在了，是吾會堅定屹立在思想中而永遠不滅呢？「漸悟」是低能兒的事，而低能兒不會是龜兔賽跑中的烏龜嗎？　　大智若愚，希望大智者虛心些。不過，說句煞風景話：天下根本沒有大智，只有自以爲大智的愚人。多歧之路  丁諦　　放舟曲江中，島嶼多縈　，抑或驅車古道上，車轍多縱橫時，一個旅人常因不辦東西，愴然於多歧之路。　　不是半直如矢的天道，沒有路標，沒有人指引，而况天色又十分灰暗，山雨欲來，黑雲滿天，旣不能登高望遠，又不能察目辦微，你將無心雍容鎭　，若無其事的獨立於歧途，牲口已疲，人也飢渴，別遭刦於强梁，別委身於狼虎，該打個尖，找尋你今晚的歇宿地了。於是你得從若幹條歧途中，選擇一條你應走的路。　　每人有他的前程，每人有一個「打尖」處。牲口已疲，人一也飢渴，暮色亦已四垂，不能木立於歧途，露宿於荒野，於是旅人乃各各撑篙搖槳，秣馬膏車，各目登上山坡，度越牛隰，奔溜灘頭，迥環港　，亦各各遭遇着逆流順風，艱難平坦，鳥道羊腸，死生禍福。　　路是不測的。眼前的平坦與險巇，很難推測你的安樂與艱苦，一個聰明正直的旅人，決不能因苟安旦夕而忘記了他的前程。　　多歧的路亦復決定多歧的命運。往往一條幸福的路，埋藏於荊棘，邪惡的路，反充滿果漿。朋友，你將怎樣抉擇你的路逮呢？　　飲食那果漿嗎？還是讓荊棘刺破你的兩足呢？沒有自始幸福的路，沒有不酸澀的橄欖，沒有永遠平靜的人生。人生，天地之逆旅，不也是一段多變的歧途嗎？貧困的折磨，强權的鞭笞，甘甜的利誘，往往使你失去了主見，你不能靜下心來，顧全你的榮辱，生前與身後，祖宗與子孫。於是你享受甜美的果漿，而摒棄荊棘。　　眼前的悲哀與快樂，算來都是浮幻。短視的人眼睛不能透過浮幻，乃各各體會“前的哀樂。　　哀樂往往無常，眼前的得意，不免是將來的沮喪。得意坦途，乃陷身於泥淖；實飲果漿，乃自斃於毒汁；滿心夜宿無虞的人，乃亦葬身於狼虎。愚蠢的笑痕還遺留在　邊，貪得與苟安，郤已換來了殘酷與悲慘。　　瞬息萬變，會有遜於多岐之路的變幻嗎？幸福的，悲慘的，黑暗的，光明的，正直的，邪惡的，縱橫交錯，一一擺在你的眼前，仟你選擇。每一條路有每一條路的命運。路是多岐的，命運亦復多歧。聽憑你選擇吧。你可因此取禍，亦可因此得福。亦可遺臭萬年，亦可流芳百世。　　也許你明明知道投奔你的前程，但你怕走一條荊棘的路。人也疲，肚也餓，路也長，身體也寒冷，沒有穿吃，沒有玩兒，你不免無力，也不免厭倦。自然你不免橫一橫心，狠狠地說，蠻幹一下吧，於是你走上邪惡的路，你說是爲了生活。　　不錯，誰都要生活。走上邪惡的路，你眼前是生活了。不但生活，而目你能够放僻邪侈。你得意眼前，但你也曾縱目那遙遠，遠山與彼岸嗎？那數箭以外的歡愉，最後的終局，你能指點給我看嗎？　　你色然以喜，我能不戚然以悲？　　於是我悚然，放開眼，矚目高處與遠方；我辨識紛紜的道路。終於我發見只有兩條：眼前的苦與眼前的樂　　我再覓取一個山峯，望見更高與更遠。我看見的仍是兩條：永久的苦與永久的樂。眼前的苦樂與永久并不相同，而却相反。　　多歧的路，亦復決定多歧的命運。抉擇一下吧，你我該上路了。　　山雨欲來，黑雲滿天，暮色又復四垂。不也是你飢渴時，疲倦時，搖動時嗎？　　多岐之路，蒼茫中殊難辨識。出處你不可不愼。戰後（木刻）  流易醉  柳攸　　這好似一個甜蜜的微笑，滲入了人們的靈魂，遮去了他們的理智，使他們忘却了一切，更忘去了自己！　　瘋狂了似地，當人們遇到了那醉人的夢，醉人的酒，醉人的笑，醉入的歌聲……以及一切帶着誘惑的魔力，他們如到了迷國，他們愛着這個醉，這含着毒劑的醉。　　可是，人們的心，是那麼地憔悴，經不起半點麻醉力，在他們被陷在這深淵裏的時候，他們還不知已入了醉鄉，他們以爲還是最淸醒的人。　　沉醉着的人們，還不如在夢中，那險岌的惡境，那藏着歹意的吸引力，在他們心目中，以爲這是熱情者的施與，最可貴的序幕。　　在醉鄉中，一切的煩惱，都被丟棄了，一切的驚險，都被志懷了，人們被愉快纏綿着！　　那酒，那夢，那笑，那歌聲……使人迷戀着牠們，使入躲入牠們的漩渦中，那是醉。　　醉，誰都見不到她是可怕的，更沒有入肯信牠曾給予人們許多不利的襲擊，醉，有着使人意想不到的「陰險」！　　這是醉，世界上最可怕的，最該遠避的！</p>

<p>游藝界蒨蒨室劇話  張肖傖　　談瓊林宴之技巧　　瓊林宴這一齣戲，雖然是現在譚派流行的一齣唱做並重之劇，但是在老譚以前，如奎派以及其他各派鬚生，亦有此戲。我在民初便時常看見劉量然唱瓊林宴，劉景然肚子寬，能戲甚多，什麽戲都唱，也就是故都黎圜中戲句袱之一。不過從老譚拿出許多絕技在這齣戲裏大顯身手之後，所以其他各派髪生也就退避三舍不願動了。老譚此戲，我見過三决，第一次他從問樵一直唱到出箱為止，第二次是單唱鬧府書房以至出箱，第三次是從問樵唱到書房為止，在這齣戲裏，老譚的配角，前段的樵夫，當然是王長林，後段的兩位公差，以王長林慈瑞全的决數為最多，然神必定是錢金福，至於葛登雲一角，就沒有一定了。　　老譚在鬧府前之吊毛，他因為有武生底子，工夫特別道地，他從鑼鼓點中路步間前，來一吊毛。他與衆不同的地方，說來自然明白，別人是縱身猛向身前躍起，然後落地，老譚獨異乎尋常。在脚點之處，縱身一躍而入空間，其全身完全成一圓圈形，兩脚底幾與其頭頂相接，在台下看得淸淸楚楚，其技巧之輕靈，工夫之深純，眞嘆觀止。並且他全身落地之處，就是他脚點起躍之地，比到現在一般譚派鬚生的落地尺寸前後相差終有幾尺地步，這是老譚絕技不可及的地方。有人譏諷我常喜歡談死人，還有人以為談民初的戲劇，是鴛鴦蝴蝶派，豈非笑話，難道從前伶工的好處，就不應該提及嗎？　　老譚在鬧府葛登雲尙未擺酒宴客之前，老譚忽然聽到掩門之聲時，他的眼神特別有神，似乎抱有非常驚疑惶惑的神情。老譚面目淸癭，鼻孔向天，面肉瘦削，晚年扮相並不見好，但是他的眼神，特別的好，凡是聽過老譚的人，必定認為不虛，書房摔髮，絲毫不亂，亦見工夫。後來披葛登雲用硯當頭一下，便即倒地，亦其佳作，檢塲者必待其身將及地，始以手托之落地。出箱時老譚雙目注視公差之棍，其眼神與棍之一端，轉動成一焦點，常見他人眼神與棍之一端，不相貫注，就有上下之分了。　　老譚之外，我要談賈洪林與余叔岩，賈洪林有一特長，在書房裏唱完四平調伏桌入睡之神態，每次各有層次，尤以末一次之入睡，便遂唱聲未完，頭便伏桌，以示共精神己疲憊至不可名狀之態。此點我以為比老譚還來得出色，所以我要特地表而出之，可以知道我並不是一味崇拜老譚的。「最先與最後」觀感  倪高風　　中法聯誼會戲劇主辦的上海劇藝計，自從假事新光大戲院作星期實騐公演以來，差不多沒一劇不去賞光的，「最先與最後」，我在前天（廿三）飽了眼福。　　它是一部三幕悲劇，係高爾斯華綏名著，由顧仲彝編譯，吳仞之導演，劇作者的搆意，是暗示著「道個世界是鐵石心腸人的世界。刑罷的慘酷，使人怕得不敢自首。良心的譴責，使人難受得不敢逃避。」以至每每有人雖然感到了良心上的貴備，在表面上還是不能暴露，不能表白，結果這個良心爆炸者即至自殺，但是事實還是淹沒在黑暗裹。　　這是一個極難討好的劇本。故事是這樣地平凡王小妹是一個可憐的姑娘，在十六歲時遭了流氓的騙待生了孩子，流氓走了，她幾乎餓死，便走上了不正當的生活。最後遇到　仲華，他們互相熱愛着。忽然有一天流氓回來了，他們打起架來，一個失手，流氓就被溢死。仲華是名律師酈伯榮的弟弟。為了家，為了自己前程，伯榮祗得不避從犯的罪名，燬滅證據，呌弟弟躲藏起來！一個窮老頭子，偷了屍身上的戒子去當，給抓住了，在監獄裏受苦，並且被判死刑。仲華受良心的譴責，拒絕了他哥哥難打發他們逃避到新加坡去的錢，結果與他的愛人雙雙自殺。　　故事固然這樣平凡，塲面自然也極單純，尤其是劇中人，很簡單的只有三個，根本沒有副作用，或者有什麼塲面的特別佈置來輔助。所以很單調的僅靠力來抓住觀衆。在演出方面，籠統地說，第二第三兩幕，比較第一幕空氣，殊嫌緊張些，尤其在自殺的時候，不能有最高潮的表露。徐立（飾　仲華）章杰（飾　伯榮）張的靑（飾王小妹）三位演員，我都第一次見面，覺得他們動作對白，都有相當成功，不過章杰的嗓音，似乎比較低些，或許坐在後一些的觀衆，不能句句聽得。丁虹博士　故宮攝影展覽今日開幕  （萍）　　攝影展覽，兩年來海上還沒有舉行過，丁博士為了盡些報國心願，特將「七七」蘆溝橋事變前一月在北平所攝的作品二百點，公開展覽並義賣，今日假大新畫廳開幕，會期五天。所有作品，非當名貴。到過北平的人看了，好像舊地重游，未到過的人看了，自然別有一番滋味在心頭。右屬為世界著名的九龍壁之一角。播音圈裏的花花絮絮（五）  筆花　　（九）維揚戲　　維揚戲在播音圈裏和南方戲相較，可稱同病相憐，一樣的感到落伍，現在收昔機中能够收聽者，惟有鳳鳴社雪音社二家而已。　　（十）平劇　　說也奇怪，電臺上的乎劇，並不十分重視，現在播音者，惟明社羣芳會滑稽平劇等，推原其故，聽衆只要聽唱片，所以平劇在電台上不能發展，原因是很顯明的。　　（十一）滑稽　　老實說一句，開開收音機，無非想尋開心，找些娛樂的節目，解解悶氣，那麽惟有收聽滑稽，說的唱的，隨時隨地，可以使你發笑。滑稽在播音圈裏很有相當魔力，尤其是沿馬路的商店，他們最喜歡收聽滑稽，同時可以吸引主顧上門，低級社會沒有力量購置收音機的，總是成羣結隊的跑到商店門口去過癮，這種情形，我們在馬路上時常可以見到的。　　在播音圈裏紅極一時的滑稽家，要算劉春山江笑笑鮑樂樂張冶兒等，他們能够別出心裁，常翻花樣，此外也有十幾位勾心鬭角，各默所長，滑稽突梯，想入非非，他們能够隨編隨唱，脫口而出，可以稱得絕頂聰明，家庭中的小朋友們，最喜歡聽滑稽，希望滑稽播音員多找些關於敎育的資料，切勿一味胡鬧，提高滑稽地位，那是筆者十二分盼望的。　　（十二）蘇灘　　以吳儂軟語的蘇灘，在電台上竟然不能立足，令人不解，現在播唱的惟朱國樑莊海泉筱桂蓀小娃娃顧秀英數人而巳。平心而論，蘇灘確有一聽的價値，可惜難以發展，反給申曲佔美於前，令人感到無限遺憾，王寳慶的蘇州文書，却很風行，一齣「十　空」是他的不朽之作。　　（十三）小曲　　從前在電台上唱小曲的，誰都知道要推錢麗麗，如今錢麗麗隱姓匿名，不彈此調已久，惟有徐文娟王瑤琴顧玉蓮三人，聽了他們的小曲，不期而然的會感想到錢麗麗。　　（十四）雜耍　　錢榮卿潘芝鄉翁德與尹世鶴劉心田馮慶芳夏希甫施資初的「宣卷」，周錦芳王培根白鳳英王囝囝王稼樂的「常錫文戲」，石人望的「口琴」，朱少伯的「杭曲」，筱荷花的「越劇」，崔君俠的「粵曲」，浦夢古林鳴唐喬司的「音樂」，都是播音圈裏的著名人物，至於「敎靑」「常識一「宗敎」等節目，都很高尙，惜乎聽衆們並不重視，忽略不聽，原因是沒有興味，這是引為憾事的。　　播音圈裏的花樣，總是上面所述的幾種，並沒有新的發展，聽衆們白久生厭，長此以往，再不改革，恐怕播音事業會一落千丈，漸歸淘汰哩，播音圈裏諸位同志，快快起來吧！（完）空前貝多芬　慈善音樂大會　　趙梅伯敎授指揮　百人合唱彌撒曲　　本埠中西音樂專家及美國敎堂音樂委員會為救濟難民起見，定於五月四日晚八時半在貝當路美國敎堂聯合舉行紀念樂聖貝多芬音樂大會，節目中有鋼琴小提琴大提琴等二部三部合奏，並百人合唱全部C調彌撒曲，由趙梅伯敎授指揮，該曲造意深遠，作風偉大，歌員均為滬上專門研究音樂人才，造詣精邃，此次在藝術上定有一番貢獻，凡愛好音樂關心難民人士，幸勿失之交臂。票價三元二元一元，永與琴行賚瑞羅羅辦臣及美國敎堂均有代售。棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　第四十八局　風月逐日　　晉江丁子堯擬　　紅先勝　　着法明日披露　　昨日「牧馬悲嗚」着法、　　車一平四（變）馬四進六　車一進三　將六退一　砲二平四（再變）　　馬六退八　砲七平四　馬八進六　砲四平五（三變）馬六退八　　砲四平七　馬八進六　車四進二　砲三平六　砲七進五　士五進四　砲五進一　將六平五　馬八退六　將六退一　車一進二　砲六退五　車一平四　　（變）車一平四　將六平五　車一進三　士五進六　車一平四　將五退一　車四進一　將五退一　車四進一　將五進一　車四進六　將五進一　車四平五　將五平四　車四退一　馬四退五　車四平五　　（再變）砲二平四　士五進六　車一進一　將六退一　馬八退六　將六平五　馬六退四　將五平六　馬四退六　馬六退八　砲七平四　馬八進六　馬八進六　士四進五　車一進一　將六進一　馬六退五　　（三變）砲四平五　士五進六　車一平四　將六平五　馬八退六　將五退一　車四進二</p>

<p>衣食住行八表風行之英王室欽定色采  史志　　Royal　Colours　　一九三九年之五月，新大陸之美利堅合衆國，舉行世界博覽會，英王喬治六世曁英后伊麗莎白兩陛下　以其時，巡遊英領坎拿大，而將便道抵美一行，勝蹟流傳，炳耀萬國，不僅增進英與美歷代相承之友誼，裨益世界和平。且此春融日麗之五月花時，兩陛下臨蒞期會宴集，冠蓋裙釵，朝宗江海，自當為社交界別呈異采。並聞英后伊莎陛下，近更頒定兩種顏色，令行天下，俾因紀念英元首遠渡大西洋之盛典，而入時新樣，舉世風從。一曰五月丁香，Mayflowerliac，其全文為五月花之丁香色，五月花為海舶名，西元一千六百二十年，（距今三百餘年以前）最初渡美之英僑在今美東部之侔丘Massachusetts省登陸者，即乘五月花Mayflower號海舶，泛大西洋者也。又彼英地五月著花多種植物之總名，亦曰「五月花」，淡紫之丁香，本以五月為著花期，五月丁香之為顏色名，實兼歷史時令與地域之三種寓意，洵不愧為妙絕一時之宮闈韻事。二曰英后藍，Regina　Blne，又可譯作元妃藍或正宮藍，今坎拿大大陸中央有后城Regina，或曰元妃市，適富　陛下此行御榮所經之通道，元妃之為顏色名，源出臘丁文，蓋一語雙關，人地兩合者也。　　査今西方先進國英法德義西荷諸文之顏色名稱，通行於世者凡二百種，其令黃紅妃紫藍白黑，各得數色或數十色，大抵借助於花果蔬菜或紡織之名或國名。五月丁香之衣料，分深中淺之三級，深者其色如　紫，Royalpurple，適中者如皇袍紫，Imperial　Pnrple，淺者乃作淡紅蘭花Orchid　pink之淺妃色，淺者比丁香色為略紅。此一例也。英后藍之衣料亦三級。深者如靛靑，Indigo，適中者如礦石藍，，Mineral　blue，淺者則如鋼藍，Steel　Blue，英后藍與寳藍Royal　blue不同之點，以其色微灰暗，不若寳藍之濃潤，此又一例也。我華文化之悠久，於世界冠絕羣倫，華瓷色彩之麗且豐，他國望而却步，而東方之花國，尤舉世所艷稱，如美人祭胭脂水桃浪桃片（以上瓷品）九重錦帥旗七香車（以上花名）之為紅，西湖水葡萄水新橘瓜皮孔雀鸚哥秋葵菠菜之為綠鷄油蜜蠟茶葉末（以上瓷品）金盞佛蒲團蟹爪乳鵝大明錦（以上花名）之為黃，茄皮葡萄（以上瓷品）紫薊紫綬之為紫，繽紛錯互，美不勝收。前任美國金山省大學敎授江亢虎三十自壽詩云：「靑袍點草重，綘帳護花低。」十字之中，包含四種色彩，如得有心人加以整理，憑色度之深淺為號次，則顏色辭典之刊行，誠大有裨於新工業與廣吿之學矣。短祺袍  三思　　近來女人們的短旗袍又「摩登」起來了，但這不像以前的那麽短到膝蓋的上面，他的樣子却取在長短兩者之問，長度剛好在女人們的小腿的脚踝上。　　在推行節的運動中，這短旗袍的復興，也不是無意義的　　第一，如果要穿新衣裳的人，可以少買幾尺布，省了幾毛錢，這是每個人都可以見到的。第二，許多人穿旗袍每每因為個子高了，過去的穿起來短了幾寸，伊們便會因為不合時便把他放至箱子裏讓蛀蟲去光顧。但這短旗袍流行起來的話，伊可以把短的衣衫傘出來再穿，不用錢買，又有一件新式衣裳，這不是無形中實行了節的運動嗎？　　而且，即使有一些愛「摩登」的女人們想穿短旗袍也是輕而易舉的事，只要把舊有的長旗袍剪去一段，不又是一件新式旗袍嗎！無論最初創行的人的用意怎樣無聊，但只要有大多數人效尤，便可以風行一時了。窗之淸潔法  佩　　窗之種類甚多，我們在上海所常見者，有玻璃窗，百葉窗，格子窗等數種，其構造旣異，故淸潔法亦隨之而不同，茲就經騐所得，略述於次：　　（一）玻璃窗　此窗最為普通，而亦為最重要者；室內光錢的明黯，全視窗之淸潔而決定，故常宜保持明朗。其淸潔法可用石灰水以抹布蘸而拭之，則塵埃易去。惟應注　抹布應用麻布，因棉布纖纖維短而易落，着於玻璃上極難揩去。而麻布則纖維長，故較棉布為佳。現在市上發售之一種玻璃肥皂，其成分為炭酸鈣與油脂等，為幾種淸潔劑之綜合製品，故效甚佳。惟用時不宜多蘸，恐其凝聚於窗上。又凡揩拭玻璃窗，應先從框之四週而拭至中央，從上部順次而下。　　（二）格子窗　此窗之窗格，大都縱橫交錯。玻璃多而小，故揩拭時較大玻璃窗為難。其法可先噴以水，再以乾布抹之。窗格可用布包樹蠟桐油等擦抹，以增光澤。　　（三）百葉窗　此窗大都在西式洋房中有之，普通中國式房屋尙未能普遍，拭時，先將各葉放開，以濕布橫拭。次將各葉關閉，以乾布平拭。待乾後，再以油脂塗於葉面，俾增光澤。非常時期之臥室設計  （德綱）一星期經濟菜單  華英女士　　這幾天巿上，明蝦很多，價也不貴，大槪一角錢可買三隻，出兩角錢買了六隻，那就可以解決一天兩餐的　菜問題了。明蝦的煮法很多；最普通的，是切成了一段段的紅燒，但是很不經吃，譬如一隻蝦連頭帶尾切而為四，很容易的一吃就完了。所以經濟些的辦法，還是切成了丁，煮豆腐吃，不但經吃，並且味兒也很鮮美。此外也可把明蝦丁代替蝦仁，和了鷄蛋一起炒，要是不用鷄蛋，那麽用豆苗，蠶豆瓣，竹筍丁等同炒，也是很可口的。　　星期一　　百葉包肉湯　明蝦燒豆腐　雪菜豆瓣湯　油條炒靑菜　　星期二　　十景肉燉醬　淸炊鯽魚湯　葱油蘿蔔絲　紅燒捲心菜　　星期三　　榨菜炒肉絲　明蝦炒鷄蛋　淸炒水芹菜蝦子炒麵筋　　星期四　　咖哩牛肉片　醋溜大黃魚　紅燒蘿蔔片　冬菰綫粉湯　　星期五　　菜乾紅燒肉　豆苗明蝦丁　雪菜黃豆芽　淸炒金花菜　　星期六　　麵筋嵌肉湯　紅燒塘鯉魚　菠菜燒豆腐　京冬菜粉皮　　星期日　　醬汁肉　煎鮝魚　炒　菜　菉互芽沙漠上的火車  茶客　　沙漠上的火車，就是駱駝　　駱駝在南方不大看見，人們覺得希奇，但在塞外，駱駝這東西，至少可以使你每天同它見面。至於那些拉駱駝的人們，更不用說是時刻皆與駱駝生活在一起的了。　　在從前，西北交通唯頓駱駝的時候，新疆，蒙古，綏遠，甘肅等省，差不多每家人家都養有幾頭駱駝，以備使用。　　小的時候，我也非常愛看駱駝，因為它們一個一個的排起隊來，不避風霜，不怕寒雪，邁着大步向前勇進，眞有火車一樣的神氣。　　駱駝在塞外，普通是白天行而夜宿的，若進了關，那就要夜行而日宿了。這是因為塞外無一定之路綫，大半都在沙漠與草地中而行，所以前進後退，並無顧慮，到了關內，夏秋有田禾，就是冬天，也因有一定的道路，不能隨便亂跑，也不許牠們隨便亂跑，所以牠們就只有在黑暗中來前進了。（未完）衣之洗濯問題  天虛我生　　予在兒時，習見廚娘浣婦，每日以柴灰盛於淘米竹籮中，以沸水淋取其汁，即以浸抹布及圍身裙等並不需用胰皂，而油垢盡去，永久如新，亦不易破。及今思之，其作用實為天然之鉀肥皂，勝於現時所用之鈉肥皂多矣。凡製絲光綫時，如用苛性鉀以代苛性鈉，則其成品直與舶來品無異，光澤而柔軟，絕不損其纖維。故凡漂布及毛巾或漂綳布及製藥棉，無不有此顯著之不同。即以手帕而論，凡用鈉肥皂洗濯者，愈洗愈硬而愈粗，其病亦在乎鈉。吾人製造玻璃及製雪花膏與剃鬚皂，所獲得之經騐，亦均鈉不如鉀，是明證也。柴灰含有鉀質，鄉農亦早知之，故凡鄉農可以壅田之灰，即為吾人可以提碱之原料，大凡棉子桐子之壳以及棉花或豆麥之桿茅草蓬蒿以及艾桿玉蜀黍桿向日葵桿無不可用。（惟不能壅田者即無用）欲知可用與不可用，但以灰浸沸水，試以指捻之，感覺滑性，即為含碱之證。提煉方法，亦至簡單，竟可不用任何機械，但用木桶或小缸四隻，各於近底處旁開一孔，排列於梯級式之架上，各以竹簍盛灰，置於共中，即用沸水從最高一桶淋下，使其下流之水，經過第二三四桶而出，即成濃液，可以煎乾成塊，再以此塊擊碎，與木屑拌和，盛於澆鐵鍋中，即以鐵鍋入灶肚中，令火燄撲入鐵鍋之內，使木屑燃燒成炭，（忌用松木屑因其含有松香故不適用，此外任雜木之鋸屑或切稻草以代木屑亦可如用穀壳尤佳）然後取出，即以冷水浸之，則凡有機物質，悉變為炭，自能沈澱脫色，取其上淸液於磁盆中煎乾，即成白色塊碱，是為炭酸鉀。其價値效用，均比幾酸鈉（即純碱）為高，市上稱為吉利碱者即此，而其實吉利乃加里之誤，加里即是鉀之譯音，正與鈉之譯為曹達相同。鉀製肥皂，稱為軟肥皂，消化油睛之力，比鈉肥皂為强，故其用量可减少過半。皂廠如用苛性鉀以代一部分之苛性鈉，可以增加硬性之固體油類，即其成本大可减輕，而且可使品質提高。故用柴灰提碱，可以大批銷售於肥皂廠及造紙廠，漂染廠，玻璃廠，毛巾廠等，而提過一次之灰，仍可用壅田，蒼提出之碱，不過對於灰量百分之五即每二十担灰，提出一擔碱後，其壅田之效用，至多不過减少四分之一，如其土壤本為粘土，則用此種淡灰，尤足以資改良土質，甚有益也。至於上述梯級式之排列，在第一次淋水之後，可將最高一桶撤去，即以第二三四桶遞升一級，而以新灰置第四桶處，仍於最高之第一桶淋水如前，依此循環不絕，即其生產不息，雖成一大工廠，亦可能也。惟鉀碱露置，易於吸濕還潮甚至溶解，宜仿桐碱之式，用瓦　或鐵桶貯之，以便行銷。至其售價，以較純碱之半為宜，例如純碱巿價每一百斤十六元時，可售八元，直接化水，用以洗濯油垢衣物，可以不必製成肥皂，蓋即所謂洗濯碱也。布衣用此洗滌，最為經濟，能使布不起毛變硬，卽其壽命可以延長，而且粗硬之布可以愈洗愈軟，若欲其硬，則但加其漿衣之法，浣婦皆優為之也。農村副產，惟此最為簡便而切實用，盍羣起而圖之。白楊在四川的笑話  鶴　　電影明星，在一般人目光中，大都視為摩登的事物創造者，所以電影明星的舉止以及衣飾，在在有人仿傚，據說白楊等在重慶，極為靑年人注目，以是發生不少笑話，原來在她們到四川的時候，還在夏末秋初，這一輩人在上海慣了的，高跟鞋裏面套着一雙赤足，豈知在街上走過幾次後，巳為人矚目，不到數天，一般婦女，竟也都赤了足摩仿起來了，又有一天，白楊應邀去拍照，為了頭上沒有裝飾，就解一根衣帶在髮上束成一個蝴蝶結，豈知叉創成風尙，一時間重慶各色緞帶竟傾售一空，這不是笑話麽，其實呢，白楊等在上海，就不能如此聳人耳目了，而上海的仕女，都會摩仿外國的電影明星，並不需要摩仿白楊等裝飾哩，而且有些電影明星，反而會向一般社交界人物學時髦，譬如說吧，最近上海高等社會的衣物洗染，咸以『送交凡爾登乾洗』為最時髦，成為一時風尙，許多電影明星，也追縱把衣服送到凡爾登去乾洗，這就是一個明證，實在，凡爾登的服務也確實週到忠實，所以能够到得全巿百分之八十以上高等社會的信仰，你也不妨試嘗一下，祗須打個電話到八三三八八去。他們就可以派人來接洽，試騐一次服務的工作情形，自然就可明瞭成為一時風氣的理由了。</p>

<h3>The Counteroffensive of Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Proceeds Like a Hot Knife Through Butter: Fierce Street Battles in Nanchang City; Capturing Liantang and Advancing to the Eastern Suburbs Airport, Resulting in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Japanese Troops West of Wanshou Palace and Shitougang Completely Eliminated; Troops Attacking Fengxin Have Reached the Northern Suburbs and Are Fiercely Assaulting the City Walls</h3>
<p>Gao'an: A certain unit of the Chinese army, with a swift and mobile deployment, stormed into Nanchang on the 24th, engaging in fierce street battles with the Japanese army, killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. On the 25th, all the Japanese troops in Liantang fled back to Nanchang for reinforcements. Until this morning, fires broke out everywhere in Nanchang city, the situation was chaotic, and Japanese corpses were scattered throughout the streets and alleys. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Dispatch from 4 PM on the 26th)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: In recent days, the Chinese army, with extremely meticulous arrangements, has steadily advanced step by step, launching a full-scale offensive against the Japanese troops in the Nanchang area. Since the 22nd, the Chinese army has successively captured important strongholds such as Shi Street, Xiliang Mountain, and Xincun, and taken advantage of the victory to press towards Nanchang. On the 24th, a certain unit of the Chinese army crossed Xiangtang North and besieged the Japanese troops entrenched in Liantang. The Japanese army attempted to resist stubbornly, engaging in fierce battles for two days, advancing and retreating several times, with heavy casualties on both sides. By the morning of the 26th, the Japanese army finally collapsed and began to retreat. The Chinese army then recaptured Liantang at 10 AM this morning and continued to advance fiercely towards Nanchang. At the same time, another route of the Chinese army detoured and attacked the airport in the eastern suburbs of Nanchang, resulting in a bloody hand-to-hand battle. Flames soared into the sky in Nanchang city, visible from dozens of miles away. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Shanggao: The Japanese troops in Gaoyou City broke through last night without success. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. On the 26th, the Chinese army continued the siege, engaging in fierce battles all day, and finally recaptured it at 7 PM, capturing quite a few spoils of war, which are currently being counted. Also, last night, Japanese reinforcements attacked Xiangfuguan, causing it to be briefly lost. After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked, it recaptured Xiangfuguan at 4 PM this afternoon. By then, the few Japanese troops west of Wanshou Palace and Shitougang who were stubbornly resisting by relying on fortifications were completely eliminated. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Shanggao: The Chinese army attacking Fengxin had approached the city walls by 10 AM on the 26th and were launching a fierce attack on the city. The Japanese army set fire to civilian houses and showed signs of abandoning the city and fleeing elsewhere. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: A certain route of the Chinese army besieging Fengxin had advanced to the northern suburbs by the morning of the 25th, resulting in a bloody battle. The Japanese army's ability to resist stubbornly has gradually diminished. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: In Cheping, west of Fengxin, there were 2,000 Japanese troops, more than ten tanks, and several light artillery pieces, which were the main force in the Fengxin area. On the morning of the 23rd, a certain route of the Chinese army attacked this Japanese force, engaging in fierce battles for a full night. At dawn on the 24th, Japanese soldiers were dead and wounded, and they began to flee in disarray towards Fengxin city. After occupying Cheping, the Chinese army is continuing to advance. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Shanggao: Baishi Ridge, ten li northeast of Gao'an, is located west of the Xiang-Gan Highway and is an important stronghold used by the Japanese army to counterattack Gao'an. When the Chinese army recaptured Gao'an, this place was severely threatened. However, the Japanese troops entrenched in this area, relying on a force of over a thousand men and taking advantage of strong fortifications such as bunkers and barbed wire, stubbornly resisted. After the brave Chinese soldiers besieged them for two full nights, they finally completely captured the area at dawn on the 26th. In this battle, over 800 Japanese soldiers were killed, dozens were captured alive, and 26 light and heavy machine guns, two mortars, over 300 rifles, and countless other military supplies were seized. This was a stunning victory since the Chinese army's counteroffensive on this line. The remaining hundred or so Japanese troops are now fleeing in disarray to Yangjiaban, ten li east of the area. The Chinese side has dispatched a team to track and pursue them closely. Another unit of the Chinese army occupied Fenshuiwei and Zhuyuan Hucun, two villages more than thirty li northeast of Gao'an, at 9 AM on the 26th, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops are fleeing towards Dachengtian Zhang between Fengxin. The Chinese army is pursuing and advancing. The Japanese troops in Gaoyou City are still being besieged by the Chinese army and will soon be annihilated. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Shanggao: According to reports, in the battle of Baishi Ridge on the 26th, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, including one battalion commander and three company commanders. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Four hundred Japanese troops in Liantang retreated to Nanchang due to pressure from the Chinese army. There are no traces of the Japanese in Liantang. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing): According to Chinese military news from Jiangxi Province, after a fierce battle of 24 hours, the Chinese army captured Dachengtian, northeast of Gao'an, on April 24th. The Japanese army is now retreating north towards Fengxin. The Chinese army fighting on the Hunan-Hubei border, after capturing Tongshan, continued to advance west along the highway and captured Nanlinqiao on the night of the 24th. Battles are currently taking place on the highway southwest of that place leading to Chongyang. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Shanggao: The Japanese troops in Liantang have all retreated. The Japanese troops in Xiebu City, to the northeast, were also completely eliminated by the Chinese on the morning of the 26th, capturing 17 Japanese secret service agents and lower ranks, seizing eight machine guns and 67 rifles.

<p>(Chongqing): According to today's Chinese military report, the Chinese army occupied Dachengtian, 25 miles west of Nanchang and 12 miles south of Fengxin, yesterday. The Chinese side stated that this report is quite important because Dachengtian is located on the highway between Fengxin and Nanchang, which is the only line of communication for the Japanese between these two points. It is said that the supply source for the Japanese troops guarding in Fengxin has been cut off. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: When the Chinese army captured Xiguloupu in Dachengtian, they seized 40 Japanese tanks and automobiles. Due to transportation difficulties, they have all been burned. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Orchestration of Anti-Foreign Movements by Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>Japan has recently instigated a kind of anti-British, French, and American foreign exclusion movement in the occupied areas of China. In the past few days, various anti-British, French, and American leaflets and slogans in Chinese and Western languages have been found in Beijing and Shanghai. Various newspapers published by puppet organizations have also unanimously launched attacks on Britain and France. According to yesterday's Reuters telegraphic dispatch, this anti-foreign movement has already spread to other areas under Japanese military occupation--English goods in shops in Anqing have been searched and burned under the slogan of anti-foreignism. It is also rumored that the Japanese special service organization in Peiping has allocated 500,000 yuan as propaganda expenses for anti-British and American activities. The development of this disguised anti-foreign movement is indeed very worthy of international attention.</p>
<p>In the past 22 months of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has never given up on its efforts to exclude European and American forces in China. Why is it now launching a large-scale anti-British, French, and American movement? And why is it so obviously directing puppet organizations to carry it out? This active and intensified action to undermine European and American interests in China is only being carried out at this stage of the war. Naturally, there are several major reasons for this: First, Japan's 22 months of war against China have already exhausted its people and resources. Moreover, the recent active assistance to China by Britain, the United States, and other countries is sufficient to promote the situation that China "will surely win the war of resistance." Therefore, it wants to take advantage of the current tense situation in Europe to launch this anti-foreign movement to demonstrate against European and American democratic countries. On the one hand, it certainly wants to use this to intimidate various countries not to provide further assistance to China. At the same time, it also plans to use this method to force various countries to persuade China to surrender and seek peace, as a condition for stopping the anti-foreign movement.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to reduce the criticism from various countries, Japan is instigating puppet organizations to carry out anti-foreign activities so that it can achieve practical results under the guise of the Chinese people. It can claim to the international community that the anti-European and American movement is only an expression of Chinese public opinion. In this way, all the protests from European and American countries caused by the past acts of destroying European and American industries in China, endangering the lives of their officials, expatriates, and residents, and blocking traffic on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, and prohibiting foreigners from operating and trading in the occupied areas, can be evaded. Now that it is destroying the rights and interests of European and American countries under the guise of the Chinese people, it can completely shift these responsibilities to the Chinese people, while the actual benefits are enjoyed by itself as the occupier. It knows that with the normal diplomatic relations between Britain, France, the United States, and the National Government of China remaining as friendly as ever, it will not establish diplomatic relations with puppet organizations, and naturally there will be no way to lodge a protest. In this way, unless Britain, the United States, and other countries decide to protect their rights and interests by force, Japan can very easily and skillfully complete its dream of a "New Order in East Asia."</p>
<p>In addition to the above two major reasons, Japan's attempt to use this to alienate the friendship between China and European and American countries is naturally also an important attempt. However, those with discernment in European and American countries know very well that the inside story of this trick is directed by Japan. Think about it, the Chinese people in the Japanese-occupied areas are only living under bayonets. Where else can there be any real expression of "public opinion"? If genuine public opinion could be expressed, why not oppose the violence that creates a bloody atmosphere, but instead exclude the irrelevant European and American forces? This shows that this trick of alienating the friendship between China and European and American countries is also shallow and boring, and who can be deceived by it?</p>
<p>As for wanting to use this to arouse the emotions of the general Chinese people against Britain, the United States, and other countries, the Chinese people live under bombing every day, and the distinction between "foe or friend" has long been proven by ironclad facts. There is no need for propaganda movements anymore. It seems that the anti-foreign movement implemented by Japan through puppet organizations is still mostly aimed at threatening the rights and interests of European and American countries in China and alienating the feelings between China and foreign countries. Although people in Britain, the United States, and other countries will never fall for Japan's conspiracy, there is one thing that is noteworthy: Japan's attempt to dominate the Far East is becoming increasingly clear because of this incident. The European and American democratic countries are currently conducting an anti-aggression front. How will they deal with Japan's anti-foreign movement that infringes on the rights and interests of various countries under the guise of the Chinese people with practical and effective methods?</p>
<p>Xiushui: The Chinese army besieging Wuning still occupies Chaping'ao, Yuanzhujian, and Maogouling, commanding a strategic height. The Japanese army is completely under the control of the Chinese army. Because of their repeated attempts to invade, they have not been successful. Therefore, yesterday they launched a counterattack against the Chinese army from Qilishanao, but they were still repelled. A small part of the Japanese army that attacked the left flank of the Chinese army was deeply infiltrated by adventure. They were cut off from the rear by a Chinese army raid and were unable to retreat. They were all annihilated, capturing two light machine guns, 21 rifles, and some military supplies. Most of them retreated to the Qilishanao area and were stalemated with the Chinese army. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing): According to military sources here, the Chinese army continued to advance in northern Jiangxi Province yesterday, dividing its forces into two routes to counterattack Nanchang. The first route, after recapturing Gao'an, has advanced 30 kilometers, so it is now only 50 kilometers from Nanchang. The second route advanced towards Fengxin. As a result of the Japanese army's active reinforcements, fierce battles have broken out in Cunqianjie. Well-informed sources believe that the Jiangxi battle will enter a decisive stage recently. In addition, the Chinese army attacked Japanese positions 20 kilometers south of Nanchang along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and minor contacts also occurred. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Arrive Outside Xianning</p>
<p>(Chongqing): According to today's report from the Chinese military, the Chinese army fighting in the Tongshan and Daban area of southeastern Hubei has advanced to the outskirts of Xianning on the Yuehan Road northeast of Tingsiqiao. Fierce battles have broken out in Tingsiqiao. In addition, powerful Chinese troops are now attacking south from Tongshan, attacking the Japanese army's fortifications south of the railway near the border of Hunan, Chongyang. It is said that fierce battles are taking place at Baini Bridge, 12 miles east of Chongyang. Since the Chinese army has recaptured Tongshan, Daban, Nanlinqiao, Baini Bridge, and other places, two-thirds of the Chongyang Yangxin Highway, which the Japanese army relied on as the transportation line in southern Hubei, has fallen into the hands of the Chinese army. It is said that the Chinese army is now trying to isolate the Chongyang army. At the same time, it is said that the Chinese guerrillas have attacked Zhifang on the Yuehan Road south of Wuchang. The Japanese garrison suffered 200 casualties, and several military supply depots were destroyed. According to the Chinese front-line report, in order to resist the Japanese army's counterattack on Gao'an, the Chinese army is now advancing to Fengxin in two routes, and is now only half a mile from the area. The Chinese guerrillas who retreated from Guling have joined the Chinese troops in Minshan. According to Chinese military experts, the Chinese army in Guling had no other way out and had to retreat. Fierce battles are currently taking place in Zhaopu, the Zhejiang port recently captured by the Chinese army. It is said that a large number of Japanese reinforcements are now planning to attack Zhaopu in four routes. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Changsha): Since the Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi and southern Hubei have launched attacks using mobile tactics in recent days, they have all achieved amazing results. The Japanese troops who invaded the Jiangxi and Hubei borders have suffered unexpected blows, not only exhausted and unable to take care of each other, but also showing signs of shaking and collapse. In northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army has recaptured Gao'an and occupied Dachengtian, an important stronghold connecting the Xiang-Gan Highway via Tanxi, Anyi, and Fengxin, and wiped out the remaining Japanese troops between Gao'an and Dachengtian, as well as counterattacking Fengxin and Wuning, crushing the Japanese army's established plan to invade Changsha and Zhuzhou from this route, and further causing the Japanese forces to collapse. Nanchang was subsequently shaken. In southern Hubei, the Chinese army recaptured Tongshan, occupied Nanlinqiao and Daban, and approached Chongyang. The only bridge (i.e., the east-west Qian Highway section between Nanlinqiao and Xintanpu) on which the Japanese army relied to connect the Hubei-Jiangxi and Hunan-Hubei highways has been cut off. The Japanese army originally entrenched between Chongyang and Tongcheng has been driven out of the highway by the Chinese army and is gradually restricted to the area north of Yuezhou. Military observers believe that the Chinese army's consecutive victories in northern Jiangxi and southern Hubei have laid the foundation for the final victory. (Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing): According to Chinese military news, there was not much change in the battle situation in southern Hubei Province yesterday.

(Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing): The Chinese army on the central China front advanced eastward from Tongshan and has reportedly recaptured Daban. The Chinese army is now continuing to advance towards Nanchang, and they are also attacking Fengxin and Jing'an. The Chinese army captured the above two locations and advanced eastward, thereby cutting off the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, causing a major blow to the Japanese army's transportation line. A Chinese spokesman said that he believed that the Japanese side had concentrated its forces in Suiyuan Pinghan and other places, and once a war broke out in Europe, the above-mentioned areas would become the base for future wars, or could become the center for responding to demonstrations by certain European countries. However, assuming that war does not break out in Europe, the above-mentioned areas will take a defensive stance without attacking. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army in Eastern Henan Attacked Kaifeng Three Times, Annihilating 2,000 Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Luoyang): The Chinese army has launched three attacks on Kaifeng. Within ten days, it attacked the city twice, once entering the West Gate. The Chinese army's heroic spirit is worthy of praise and song. The circumstances of the three attacks on Kaifeng are summarized as follows: The first attack started at 12 PM on the night of the 10th. The Chinese army, with fewer than two battalions, attacked from the southwest and occupied the outer city first, then approached Caitun and the railway station. Although the Japanese army resisted desperately, it was difficult to stop the Chinese army's vigor. By dawn, the railway station and Caitun were occupied, and part of the Chinese army broke into the South Gate of the city, engaging in hand-to-hand street battles with the Japanese army, killing many of them. The Japanese ammunition depot was blown up, the warehouse was burned, and the water tower was destroyed. For a time, the fire illuminated the sky, floods spread everywhere, and the sound of explosions resounded through the clouds. This was a major gain for the Chinese army. The second attack was only one day later. Under the Japanese army's intensified defense, they re-entered Kaifeng on the morning of the 12th. This attack also involved only about 100 people. Everyone charged with the spirit of hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese army swept through the city for five hours, destroying many enemy and puppet agencies and killing many Japanese soldiers. When the remaining Japanese soldiers fled in large numbers, the Chinese army had safely returned to their defense positions. After the Chinese army's two attacks, the Japanese army was extremely panicked. Within a few days, they transferred more than 6,000 reinforcements from Xuzhou, which, added to the original number, was nearly 10,000. On the night of the 20th, the Chinese army launched a third attack. With only one battalion, they were able to break through the Japanese army's strict and solid defense, killing countless Japanese soldiers, re-occupying the railway station, and attacking the West Gate, setting fire to the Japanese and puppet agencies and treasuries. Their heroic and fearless spirit is worthy of national praise. In the above three attacks, a total of 2,000 Japanese soldiers were annihilated, causing great panic among the Japanese and puppets. Within a few days, important documents and items were moved one after another, and the puppet organization moved to Luowangdian. (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Where is Japan Heading Amidst the Changes in Europe?</h3>
<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph claims that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had planned to visit Berlin, but the departure date remains unknown. This is likely a sign that negotiations to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance have broken down. According to sources in Rome, Ciano has canceled his plan to attend the German parliament and listen to Hitler's speech. Japan's hesitation stems from its naval authorities' apprehension about President Roosevelt's order to concentrate the American fleet in the Pacific. However, Hitler is reportedly making a final effort to change the Japanese government's attitude. Meanwhile, a dispatch from the Times in Tokyo states that the Japanese government is currently engaged in intense deliberation, uncertain of which course to take. Whatever encouraging words Hitler may utter in the German parliament on Friday, it cannot be said that Japan is willing to fight for the Axis powers in the Pacific. This situation, as well as the future of the Yonai cabinet, is now very delicate. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) An editorial in the Kokumin Shimbun states that, given Britain's expansion of aid to the Chinese government, which has been at war with Japan for twenty months, the development of hostility between Britain and Japan is now unavoidable. Japanese public opinion strongly supports concluding a military alliance to strengthen the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact. Now that Britain and France have allied with the Soviet Union and extended their joint policy to the Far East, restricting the activities of the pact's signatories to fighting communism is meaningless. Britain and America have already exerted significant economic pressure on Japan, and continuing to increase this pressure will not only harm themselves but also provoke war. To bring the expedition to China to a successful conclusion, Japan must, of course, conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. If the government does not make a straightforward decision on this point, it will be subject to severe criticism for negligence. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains the New Budget in the House of Commons, Huge Defense Expenditures, New Taxes to Compensate</h3>
<p>(London) As Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon delivered his budget speech in the House of Commons today, he announced amidst cheers a national defense estimate of £630,000,000, stating that this vast sum reflects the scope and effort the government has undertaken, and also the nation's determination in this matter. The Chancellor detailed that last year's defense expenditures, funded from tax revenue, amounted to £254,500,000, while loans accounted for £128,000,000, thus the three defense departments collectively spent £382,500,000. Including food storage and air defense equipment, the total nearly reached the round figure of £400,000,000. Additional defense spending is the most serious and urgent issue and will be the main point of contention in this budget. The estimated expenditure for supply matters is £675,000,000, and the estimated expenditure for air defense is £42,000,000, of which £37,000,000 will be covered by loans. The estimated expenditure for food storage is £5,000,000. The total expenditure is all allocated from £922,000,000 in tax revenue; additional defense expenditures are not included. The Chancellor spoke of social affairs and domestic expenses, saying that new domestic projects requiring huge expenditures are impossible under the current circumstances. Based on the current tax base, the total estimated expenditure is £980,000,000, of which £223,000,000 can be allocated to this year's defense expenses. According to the original defense expenditure estimate, £230,000,000 was to come from tax revenue. However, this year's original defense expenditure figure was £580,000,000, of which £350,000,000 was to be covered by borrowing and £230,000,000 by tax revenue. Now, due to the tension in all aspects of national defense, the figure has increased to £630,000,000, and further increases are not impossible. The difference will not be fully covered by borrowing but will be compensated by new taxes, of which £24,000,000 will be allocated from tax revenue, so taxpayers must pay £942,000,000 in taxes. The remaining £380,000,000 will be raised through loans. The Chancellor then announced the abolition of the stamp duty on medicines, a reduction in entertainment tax for theaters, and the imposition of a tax on British-made films, estimated to generate £800,000 this year and £1,000,000 in a full year. Cheers erupted when the Chancellor announced that the standard rate of income tax would not be changed, but the cheers ceased when the Chancellor then announced that the motor vehicle horsepower tax would increase from ten shillings to twenty-five shillings per horsepower from January next year. The cheers were also silent when the Chancellor announced changes to surtaxes and inheritance taxes. The Chancellor said that for incomes within £8,000, a surtax of £5 per £100 would be levied, and for those exceeding £8,000, £10 would be levied. The tobacco tax will increase from two shillings to eleven shillings and sixpence per pound from tomorrow, and the sugar tax will increase by one farthing (one-fourth of a penny) per pound from today. The Chancellor stated that the death tax rate of 10% on estates of £5,000 or more would not be changed. Based on the new tax base, the total estimated tax revenue is £942,600,000. The Chancellor concluded by mentioning the defense estimate, saying that it would not be difficult to reach this figure with borrowing, but he believed it was inappropriate to adopt such a simple solution. If taxation is convenient and tolerable to raise funds, and if borrowing is flexible and able to raise funds, then borrowing is also limited. Since the national tax burden is already so heavy, the whole country should be aware of the need for continued sacrifice. In the long run, it would not be good for the country to take it lightly and rely entirely on borrowing for all increased national expenditures, so he proposed to levy new taxes totaling £24,000,000. Due to certain points arising from the commercial treaties concluded with the United States and India, legislation is needed. He will submit a resolution in the coming days to supplement certain provisions of the Anglo-American commercial treaty. As for the Anglo-Indian commercial treaty, he will include this new one within the framework of the Ottawa Agreements Act. The Chancellor also explained that the abolition of the stamp duty on medicines and the reduction of the tax on theater tickets by one penny each would result in a loss of tax revenue of £1,000,000 for the government. The government has strived to the best of its ability to encourage a plan of confidence in commerce. If there is no setback, commerce can be expected to continue to prosper, so he avoided all plans that would have an adverse impact on industry. The Chancellor's announcement of the increase in the motor vehicle tax greatly surprised the House of Commons, and members who owned cars were all discussing this matter. The Chancellor clarified the reason for increasing the sugar tax, saying that the current foreign raw sugar tax is equivalent to nine shillings and fourpence per 112 pounds. The imperial preferential tariff will be protected, and the domestic sugar consumption tax will be adjusted.</p>
<p>After the Chancellor announced the budget, opposition leader Attlee rose to speak, saying that the Chancellor's presentation did not genuinely address the issue of meeting this huge expenditure but was merely a stopgap measure. Sooner or later, the burden of borrowing would be borne by the poorest of the poor. We should impose new taxes on accumulated assets as soon as possible, instead of incurring large interest-bearing loans, the sooner the better.</p>
<p>Liberal leader Sinclair then stated that this budget was incomprehensible to ordinary people. He believed that if taxpayers could appreciate the government's painstaking efforts regarding expenditure, the goodwill and patriotism of the people mentioned by the Chancellor would be greatly enhanced. We must determine that the huge expenditure on armaments is currently subject to economic management, and at the same time, we must curb private spending, preventing it from competing with the nation's rearmament efforts in the use of luxury goods. While supporters of the government are now demanding the conscription of manpower, there is little evidence in the budget of implementing a decisive policy to mobilize the nation's economic and financial resources for the nation's effort.

<h3>Chamberlain Announces in Parliament that Britain Has Decided to Implement Conscription; Britain Has Decided to Implement Conscription; Able-bodied Men Aged 20-21 to Receive Six Months of Training; Implementation Will Increase the Army by 310,000; Also Declares Readiness to Resume Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the government has decided to submit to Parliament the "Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill," to amend the procedures for the conscription of soldiers of all ranks and types in the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, aiming to simplify them. It will also submit a Military Training Bill next week, under which all able-bodied men in the country aged between 20 and 21 will be required to enlist and receive military training for a period of six months, and then be incorporated into the reserve forces or auxiliary forces. After the implementation of this measure, 310,000 soldiers can be obtained. The recruitment of naval personnel and air defense forces will continue to be based on a voluntary system. In addition, the government will submit another bill in the near future to "limit the profits of factories that manufacture munitions for the government to complete the armament program." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain said today that the government, urged by various countries on the European continent with whom Britain has agreements, has decided to implement conscription and has informed labor leaders that the government will first conscript able-bodied men aged 20 to 21. They will first serve in the regular army for six months, after which they will be free to choose to transfer to the army reserve or the national defense volunteer force. The number of those to be conscripted will reach 200,000, with no distinction of rank. All, regardless of class, will receive the same training. Only those with medical reasons can be exempted. The government will immediately submit a bill to call up reserves and auxiliary forces of all ranks and types. This bill will be called the "Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill" and will simplify the procedures. The government will also submit a military training bill next week, authorizing the government to call up able-bodied men nationwide aged between 20 and 21 to receive six months of military training. Only in the event of war will they be obligated to serve overseas. After completing training, if they do not wish to join the national defense volunteer force, they will be transferred to the special reserve of the regular army. It will also stipulate that those who conscientiously object to military service may be exempted by the conscription tribunal, but only on the condition that they undertake work of significant importance to the country. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the total number of those included in this conscription, excluding those actually exempted, is 310,000. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons the intention to implement conscription, opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee immediately asked, "The Prime Minister previously gave assurances that conscription would not be implemented in peacetime. Why has he gone back on his word?" Several opposition members shouted "Resign!" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The circumstances in which we find ourselves cannot be regarded as peacetime. I hope the people will think deeply and consider my words to be true." He then proposed that the issue be discussed tomorrow. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) During a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to an inquiry from a member that if the British government were convinced that negotiations with the German government would be welcomed by that country and would be fruitful, then the British government would be happy to do so. As for the international conference proposed by US President Roosevelt, although the British authorities have not received an invitation, they would welcome any initiative taken by the US and would be very willing to participate. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Nevile Henderson notified the German Foreign Office today that the British government is determined to resist German aggression. The current implementation of compulsory military service is a clear sign of this determination, but this is not intended to encircle Germany. Britain is still willing to begin negotiations at any time regarding the various economic demands made by Germany. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Unions Still Oppose Conscription; Chamberlain Explains to Them</h3>
<p>(London) After a one-hour cabinet meeting this morning, the General Secretary of the British Trade Union Congress was summoned by Chamberlain to No. 10 Downing Street to hear the government's views on the implementation of conscription. When the Prime Minister met with the union leaders, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Minister of Labour Brown were present. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with representatives of the Trades Union Congress this morning and informed them of the government's decision to implement conscription. All young men in the country aged between 20 and 21, except those physically unfit, totaling more than 200,000, will be required to enlist and serve for a period of six months, after which they will either be assigned to the reserve forces or the auxiliary forces, according to their wishes. Regarding this matter, the representatives of the Trades Union Congress expressed frankly to Prime Minister Chamberlain that the implementation of conscription in peacetime is opposed by the Trades Union Congress, and the submission of a bill to Parliament at this time would be particularly difficult. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with representatives of the Trades Union Congress at 10 Downing Street this morning to discuss the issue of implementing conscription. The Prime Minister said, "Certain countries on the European continent are planning various defensive measures with our country and wish our country to implement conscription in some way, to maintain the necessary number of troops in readiness. The government has now drafted a plan in response to the requests of those countries. All young men in the country aged between 20 and 21 will be required to enlist. Based on the population survey of 1931, the number of those to be conscripted will be 272,000." Sir Walter Citrine, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, immediately replied that the Prime Minister had announced to the House of Commons on March 29 that conscription would not be implemented in peacetime. At that time, the Trades Union Congress, recognizing the importance of national defense issues, assisted the government in implementing the National Voluntary Service Scheme based on this promise. Unexpectedly, the Prime Minister has now gone back on his word. Although compulsory military service has its limits, it is sufficient to harm the national economy, and once implemented, it will have adverse effects. This point should be noted. Also, the government plans to limit those to be called up for service to young people aged 20 to 21. It is not known on what basis this standard was set. In the view of the Trades Union Congress, if conscription is indeed necessary, then all of the nation's resources, including wealth and various means of production, should be conscripted. In summary, conscription is still opposed by the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and they will hold another meeting this afternoon to study the government's proposal. In addition, the Labour Party Executive Committee and the Labour Party Parliamentary Group are scheduled to meet separately this afternoon to discuss the issue of conscription. The National Executive Committee of the Labour Movement (i.e., the Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party Executive Committee, and the Labour Party Parliamentary Group) is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning, at which time a firm decision will be made.

<h3>Britain Implements Conscription; Germany Says It's Irrelevant; Italy Says It's Politically Significant; French Press Says It Will Restore Confidence</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung writes that regarding the British and French newspapers' claim that Britain's implementation of conscription is enough to warn Germany, people here have no impression whatsoever. If Britain's move is truly intended to give Germany the impression of a "threat warning," then we dare to say that it is a big mistake, because Germany will never be surprised by any decision, warning, or threat from Britain, nor will it change its national policy. Regarding the return of the British and French ambassadors to Germany, people here are taking a reserved attitude. The so-called speech to be given by Hitler on the 28th of this month, if it cannot satisfy the Western democracies, then Britain and France will take necessary measures to maintain European tranquility, people here believe that Germany should also be prepared to prevent unforeseen events, and take the same measures as Britain, implementing conscription. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the issue of Britain's implementation of conscription, people here originally thought that the British government's attitude was hesitant and might not act hastily. Now, upon hearing of the decision to implement it, everyone is deeply impressed. Political figures believe that this is a concession by Britain to France, because technically speaking, new recruits who have only been trained for a few months are not enough to become an elite force. However, politically speaking, the significance is very great, because Britain's war potential has increased as a result, and the evolution of the European situation will naturally be shifted by it. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Roman newspapers today published the news of the British decision to adopt compulsory military service without criticism. People here consider this a major attempt to intimidate Germany and express doubts about the ability to train a force capable of using modern weapons in a matter of months. People still generally believe that Britain has not yet become an army country. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French newspapers today unanimously welcomed Britain's adoption of conscription, saying that Britain's efforts will make the dictatorships realize that war is unwise. Le Journal claims that Australia and South Africa will follow Britain's plan. During the European War, Australia and South Africa sent strong armies to France to help in the war. Le Petit Parisien claims that Poland, Romania, and Greece will recognize Britain's decision as a very logical move to supplement their promises to aid invaded countries, and the Soviet Union and Turkey will accelerate negotiations to create an Eastern European defense line. Le Journal de Paris claims that if Britain could have sent its troops, which it had at the end of last year, to Europe on the first day of the Great War, the plans of the Central European countries would have been broken, and the advantage of the future would have been on the side of the Western European powers and their allies. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the British Cabinet decided to implement conscription, the newspapers here unanimously praised it. Le Petit Parisien reported, "This move has not only made a profound impression in France, but it will also shock countries around the world. Certain plans of those dictatorships will soon come to naught because of this." Le Journal reported that Western European countries and their allies have now truly gained an advantage." L'Écho de Paris reported that after Britain implements conscription, the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa will certainly follow suit. Le Petit Journal reported, "The Germans only respect strength. We are now also preparing to demonstrate a kind of strength so that the world knows that we also have the function of using strength." Le Temps reported, "The stronger and more courageous Britain and France are, or the more allies they have, the further war will be." L'Intransigeant reported, "Only by facing each other with strength can the all-powerful countries realize." Le Peuple reported, "The current crisis has been seen by the British diplomatic authorities, and they are working hard to make other countries aware of it. If the country had hesitated further on the implementation of conscription, it would have created a bad impression, giving the impression that Britain does not have sufficient spirit of sacrifice to effectively cope with this crisis. The government's decisive action is now imperative and brooks no delay." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Press Emphasizes</h3>
<p>(London) After the government decided to implement conscription, "The Evening Standard" commented, "Those of the nation who can understand the truth of the situation will certainly accept this natural obligation with pleasure. Those who hold dissenting views are only a few laggards. In short, Britain currently has 19 divisions of regular troops, and in the event of war, they will certainly feel that they are insufficient. After the implementation of conscription, the addition of 13 divisions will provide a sense of security." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Does Not Believe War Is Inevitable; Not Seduced by Talks with Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu told the diplomatic correspondent of the News Chronicle, Bartlett, that he does not believe that war is inevitable and that a common way to discuss peace can eventually be found. Bartlett published an article in the News Chronicle, saying that in recent months, Gafencu is probably the first among foreign diplomatic officials who have visited Berlin and have not been seduced into signing any documents that restrict their national independence. It is hoped that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković, who is currently visiting Berlin, and Gafencu, as the backbone of the Balkan Pact and the Little Entente, will not forget Gafencu's admirable example.

<p>Hitler Receives Yugoslavian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Mr. Marković, arrived here at 5:15 PM today after holding talks with the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano. He was greeted at the airport by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and they held lengthy talks at the Foreign Ministry at 6:30 PM. According to semi-official sources, both sides completely agreed on all outstanding issues. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler received the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Mr. Marković, at noon today for talks. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. A communiqué issued afterward stated only that the talks were lengthy, without further details. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Negotiations between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Marković have been very harmonious. Last night, Ribbentrop hosted a banquet at the Esplanade Hotel to welcome Marković, who, as the Yugoslavian ambassador to Germany in Berlin, had strived to promote friendship between Germany and Yugoslavia. These negotiations have further strengthened relations between the two countries, and political, economic, and cultural cooperation will be further advanced in the future. Marković responded that the purpose of these negotiations could be summed up in one sentence: to enhance cooperation between the two countries for the welfare of their peoples. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A Berlin local newspaper published an article yesterday welcoming the Yugoslavian Foreign Minister, Mr. Marković, stating that Germany's growing power must find an outlet to the southeast, and that Yugoslavia's construction work requires Germany's economic and technical assistance. Therefore, good relations between Germany and Yugoslavia are based on mutually beneficial interests. Yugoslavia's refusal to join the group of Western powers has been met with satisfaction by both German and Yugoslavian authorities. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Does Not Meet with British Ambassador, Undersecretary Receives Instead</p>
<p>(Berlin) Undersecretary of State Weizsäcker received British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson at noon today. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The meeting between the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, originally scheduled for yesterday, did not take place. According to responsible sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had other appointments and could not meet with the British Ambassador. As of last night, the date of a future meeting had not been decided. It is rumored that the British Ambassador has returned with a document for the German government, but German officials have strongly denied that the British Ambassador brought any such document. Their attitude is based on Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons that the Ambassador's return was merely a routine event after a holiday. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented on the matter, saying, "Judging from the tone of the British newspapers, London's eagerness to resume negotiations with Berlin far exceeds that of Germany."

<p>Russo-Polish Relations Show Growing Closeness; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Visits Bulgarian Prime Minister, Then Goes to Turkish Capital for Talks</p>
<p>Warsaw - A Foreign Ministry spokesman told newspapers that "[the] development of relations between Poland and the Soviet Union is deeply satisfying," and that it is particularly gratifying that Soviet authorities fully understand Poland's interests. Political circles here attach great importance to this statement, and the semi-official Polish Daily commented that Poland is willing to maintain peaceful relations with Germany, but since the issue of the Free City of Danzig arose, their views have diverged. It is important to know that "[the] Polish government cannot accept any unilateral actions that concern Poland's vital interests, nor can we tolerate the sacrifice of Poland's vital space to fulfill what they call Germany's vital space." In addition, the visit of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin to Turkey has also attracted the attention of the newspapers here. According to a Polish news agency, the Soviet Union plans to conclude a military alliance treaty with Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Sofia - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin arrived here at 7:00 AM this morning and was greeted at the station by representatives of the Foreign Ministry. At noon, he met with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. At 4:20 PM, he continued his journey to the Turkish capital. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>French Ambassador to Germany Returns to Berlin</p>
<p>(Paris) Following the return of British Ambassador Henderson to Germany yesterday, French Ambassador Coulondre also departed for Berlin at 7:15 PM today to return to his post. Responsible sources here have stated that it is a misunderstanding to believe that the return of the British and French Ambassadors to Germany indicates a relaxation of the policy of resisting aggression. In fact, the British government will implement conscription in the near future, and after the French government learned of this, it decided to send Ambassador Coulondre back to his post. All other speculations are incorrect. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Sino-American Negotiations Continue Regarding Loans and Aircraft Purchases</p>
<p>(Washington) An official of the semi-official Export-Import Bank yesterday declined to confirm the exact amount of the recent $25 million loan to China, saying that announcing such figures would be contrary to policy. However, they reiterated that the loan could not be used to purchase aircraft, and that the loan was unrelated to the current negotiations between a Chinese group and American aircraft manufacturers. It is reported that silver worth approximately $1,300,000 was shipped from China to the United States last month, a significant increase compared to recent months. Financial circles believe that at this rate, China will be able to fully repay its $15,000,000 contract with the American aircraft manufacturer within ten months. Officials here have repeatedly denied that China used the US government loan to purchase aircraft from American manufacturers. The Chinese Embassy has also stated that it has no direct connection with this transaction. Sources said that the contract negotiations were conducted entirely by the American Minister to China, Mr. Peck, and the Chinese Finance Minister, Mr. Kong, in China. The above-mentioned contract involves China purchasing combat aircraft and aircraft parts worth $15,000,000 from the United States, totaling over 100 aircraft. Mr. Peck returned to the United States on the China Clipper last week and met with representatives of aircraft parts companies, including Mr. Niddleman, in Los Angeles. It has now been learned that Mr. Niddleman returned to New York at the end of last week, and the negotiations may conclude within a few days. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>

Even if the United States wants to adopt a policy of isolation, it is not allowed by reality. The fates of the two countries are closely linked. Lord Lothian also told an Associated Press reporter that "[the] United Kingdom and the United States are the greatest countries in the world, their relationship is the most important, and the unlimited authority of both countries is the bulwark of freedom and peace."

<p>Chinese Troops in Suiyuan Recover Two Villages</p>
<p>Yulin - The villages of Shaerqin and Ergesun, located in the territory of Sa County, are in the middle of the Sui-Bao section of the Ping-Sui Railway and are important strongholds for Baotou. Recently, these two villages have been recovered by Chinese troops, posing a major threat to the Japanese troops in Baotou.

<p>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation</p>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission discussed the results achieved by the Chinese army on various fronts in the past week (April 20th to 26th), outlined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Guangdong Front: The Japanese troops in Zengcheng once reached Futian Su and Jiaodong, but after fierce attacks by the Chinese army, they retreated. The remaining enemy forces in Conghua and Xinjie have been cleared. The Japanese troops in Xijiang are engaged with our forces near Guandu and Sanshui. After repeated attacks, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. Xinhui was recaptured this week, and enemy reinforcements have been repeatedly repelled. Jiangmen is also under intense siege. As a result, the periphery of Guangzhou has been completely breached by our forces, and the city is in a state of extreme disorder. Enemy officers and their families are evacuating, and large and small traitors are fleeing to Hong Kong in a panic. Our advance troops are now close to the urban area and have even entered it at times. The remaining enemy forces are in a state of utter panic.</p>
<p>(2) Hunan-Jiangxi Front: The enemy in northern Jiangxi, after invading and occupying Nanchang, has become a spent force. This week, our army recaptured Gao'an and Gaoqiao City and advanced to the vicinity of Wanshou Palace. On one side, we occupied Dachen and attacked Fengxin, making it impossible for the enemy troops on the southern bank of the Xiu River to stand their ground. They are now wavering. The enemy in Wuning is trapped in the city after our army recaptured Changlingang, Mao Gou Mountain, and Chaping Ridge. They cannot move. Near the Fu River, our army recaptured Shi Hankou, Xiliangshan, Chong'an, and Xiangtang, making it even more difficult for the enemy to cope. The enemy's attempts to invade Changsha in northern Hunan have been very active, but they have been dealt heavy blows by our attacking troops. Yuezhou is still under our siege. Another unit of our army suddenly launched an attack the day before yesterday, capturing the most important stronghold behind enemy lines in southern Hubei, the Tong-Nanlin Bridge, proving that the enemy's strength is exhausted.</p>
<p>(3) Shanxi Front: Last week, the enemy in Taigu, Qixian, and Pingyao attempted to launch a large-scale invasion of our eastern Shanxi. After days of fierce fighting, over 2,000 enemy soldiers were killed, and the remaining enemy forces fled south from Gucheng to Zhang Nan Zhen. Yesterday, they retreated further to Chizi Hong Zhen. Their attempt to invade the east has been completely shattered. The enemy in southern Shanxi has been in a completely passive state since their failed attack on the Zhongtiao Mountains. Our army launched separate attacks, besieging Yuncheng and Zhang Dian Zhen, attacking Jie County and Yongji City, and entering them several times. In the battle of Xia Dongnan Zhen, over 1,500 enemy soldiers were killed. At the same time, ambushes were set up everywhere, making every step taken by the enemy a thorn in their side. In particular, the ambush near the Fen River killed over 300 enemy soldiers from Huoxian Nan Jiao, in addition to those who fell into the Fen River, leaving the enemy terrified and in disarray. In northern Shanxi, our army advanced towards Jingle after recapturing Wuzhai. The county seat is now surrounded, and the remaining enemy forces will soon be annihilated.</p>
<p>(4) Henan Front: The Japanese army in Kaifeng has been extremely panicked since our army stormed the city twice last week. They have been actively sending reinforcements for days. This week, our army once again stormed to the area around the Western Railway Station, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. In their anger, they attacked Changyingji and Zhongmou, but were routed after a head-on attack by our forces. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, capturing a large number of prisoners and dividing their forces to attack Huaiyang, once storming into the Northern Gate and capturing many prisoners. The enemy in Xinyang has been repeatedly attempting to stir up trouble, but they have scattered and fled after a brave attack by our forces. The county seat is still tightly surrounded by our army, and the enemy forces inside the city cannot move and are eager to escape. In northern Henan, our army has been deploying mobile tactics, raiding Jia and Kui Qinyang and sweeping Bai Xiang Zhen, leaving the enemy in a state of constant fear. In addition, the enemy forces in western Suiyuan have been repeatedly defeated. The control of the Ping-Sui Railway, the recapture of Dong Zhaoyuan, the siege of Zhucheng, the brief entry into Nanle in southern Hebei, and the attacks on Tongxian have all left the enemy in a state of panic. The activities of our army in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have caused the enemy great suffering, including capturing Haimen in northern Jiangsu, besieging Rugao, attacking Lishui in southern Jiangsu, attacking Tianwang Temple, besieging Wukang in Zhejiang, forcing Wu Xing, recapturing Wuzhen, and attacking Hushi, Jing Jiang area. The number of enemy casualties is truly incalculable. (Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>Japanese Troops in Guangzhou are Desperate, Deploying Forces to Rescue, Fierce Battles in Paitan Taipingchang, Japanese troops ambushed, suffering over a thousand casualties</p>
<p>Hong Kong News, after the Chinese army in Guangdong Province launched a counter-attack from the northeast and northwest, the Japanese army in Guangzhou is already stretched thin. Since the battles of Zengcheng and Xinjie, the main force of the Japanese army has suffered thousands of casualties. The commander of the Southern Branch of the Japanese Army, An Teng, has recently withdrawn troops from the areas around Huangpu and Xinhui to rescue Guangzhou. The Japanese troops returning to Guangzhou from Huangpu landed and went north along Shitan, joining the remnants of the Japanese army in the Zhucun and Shiqiao areas and attacking Zengcheng. On the 16th, the Japanese troops in Conghua Taipingchang, after being replenished, also gathered over 6,000 troops and went east, attacking the west of Zengcheng and advancing towards the Chinese army positions in Paitan. Paitan is located about seventy or eighty miles north of Zengcheng, supported by artillery and aircraft. The Chinese army in Paitan met the enemy head-on, and the fierce battle lasted all night. At the same time, the Chinese army that had entered Zengcheng also shifted its troops westward to encircle the Japanese troops attacking Paitan. The Japanese troops in Taipingchang were attacked from both sides and eventually could not hold on, retreating towards Shengang and other places. In this battle, another thousand or more people were killed and wounded.</p>
<p>The Struggle for Zengcheng</p>
<p>When the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops in the Taipingchang area from Zengcheng, the troops left behind in Zengcheng were inevitably weakened. The Japanese army took the opportunity to gather reinforcements in Zhucun and other places and advanced north. For the sake of the overall situation, the Chinese army planned to first annihilate the main force of the Japanese army in the Taipingchang area and then deal with the Japanese army south of Zengcheng. Moreover, Zengcheng was damaged after the seesaw battle, so it was not suitable to hold firmly. Therefore, when the Japanese troops in Zhucun approached Zengcheng on the 17th, the Chinese army deployed on both wings, guarding the northeastern strongholds outside Zengcheng. The Chinese army still holds the Litchi Ao north of the city, mutually reinforcing with the Chinese army in Paitan. The area near Zhengguo is used as a retreat area to the east. The Japanese army re-entered Zengcheng on the 17th, but the Chinese guerrillas below Zengcheng were very active. Although the Japanese army penetrated deep into Zengcheng, their rear was suddenly cut off, and there was a danger of the entire army being wiped out.</p>
<p>The Clever Strategy of the Chinese Army</p>
<p>When the Japanese troops in Taipingchang attacked Paitan, they thought that a roundabout encirclement of the Chinese army in Zengcheng could achieve their annihilation plan. When the Japanese troops in Taipingchang went east, the Chinese army in Conghua and Huaxian launched fierce attacks on Taipingchang and Shengang, and the Japanese army quickly deployed a part of its troops to respond, stubbornly resisting in the Shekeng area. As of the morning of the 18th, they were still in a stalemate. A part of the Japanese army crossed the river in Shengang and advanced to Jiulianfen and Chailankeng. The Chinese army happened to arrive, and the Japanese army fled in a panic. Another part rushed out of Shiqian Market, but was again met by the Chinese army and failed. On the 19th, the Chinese army in Paitan and Huaxian took advantage of the situation to encircle the Japanese troops in Taipingchang. If the main force of the Japanese army in this area is defeated by the Chinese army, it will be as easy as turning one's hand to recover Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Struggle of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Guangzhou knew that the situation was becoming increasingly urgent and was preparing a retreat route. Once the Chinese army in the east, west, and north launches a long drive straight down, the Japanese army in Guangzhou will be like a turtle in an urn. The remaining Japanese army has no other way to retreat except by water. Therefore, hundreds of transport ships have been gathered on the surface of the Pearl River in recent days, in preparation for emergencies. In order to prepare for covering the retreat of the remnants, Japanese troops in the rear have been deployed in recent days on the south bank of the Pearl River, from Henan in Guangzhou to Panyu and Shunde, setting up camps every step of the way, in order to contact the Japanese troops in Humen and attempt a final struggle. The Pearl River Delta (including Panyu, Shunde, Zhongshan, and other counties) is frequently adjacent to rivers and seas, and the Japanese army can use this as a retreat route. This is a cunning plan, but the area is a flat plain with no defenses to rely on. If the Chinese army conducts a sweeping aerial bombardment with a large number of aircraft and the Japanese aircraft are unable to respond, then the area that the Japanese army considers to be a safe retreat will become a collective burial ground. In short, if Guangzhou is not defended, then the barrier of the Japanese army in the Pearl River Delta will have been removed. (April 21st)</p>
<p>Guerrilla Commander Hu Zhaohan is Active in Suzhou, Repeatedly Killing Traitors, and Connecting with Various Armies</p>
<p>Suzhou News, Among the many guerrilla units active around Suzhou, there is one people's guerrilla unit composed of peasants and soldiers formed by the retreating army. The leader of this guerrilla unit is named Hu Zhaohan. He was originally from the army. There are more than 500 people in his team, equipped with complete firearms and sufficient ammunition, and carrying out political work. Train the soldiers, abide by discipline, and fulfill the responsibility of defending the territory. Now, not only is the reputation in the countryside growing day by day, and practical work has become a confidant problem for the Japanese side. For example, in October last year, in the town of Bacheng, east of Yangcheng Lake, a three-pronged attack was launched on the Japanese army's garrison. At this time, only a few Japanese guards were killed and returned due to the dark and moonless sky. In December, a rent collection office was established in the North-South Bridge Town, and more than 100 members of the Second District Anti-Opium Team were stationed. Captain Hu then led a large team of soldiers, from the west side of the Taiping Bridge, straight to the Anti-Opium Team's camp, proceeding quickly and quietly all the way, until the east was bright, and arrived in front of a tall house. Captain Hu ordered the soldiers to surround the house on all sides. The Anti-Opium Team members were awakened from their sleep and prepared to rush out of the gate, but were all intercepted by Captain Hu's subordinates. Captain Hu then explained the great righteousness and handed over all the guns and ammunition. At that time, the farmers of the villages carried hoes and shovels, and demolished the rent collection office in the North-South Bridge Town, killing the district chief and the secretary. In January of this year, it was also learned that the Ma Heng troops of the Second District Provincial Medical Inspection Team had borrowed the name of protection in Xietang Town and plundered the villagers, doing everything they could. So Captain Hu led the team and, with lightning speed, seized two light machine guns, more than 40 rifles, and a large bag of grenades. Recently, they went to Weiting Town to kill the director of the rent collection office, three staff members, and the farmers in the village were overjoyed. In addition to attacking and eradicating traitors, Captain Hu also planned some production work for the people, so the people showed such enthusiasm and enthusiasm, and there was a great encouragement in spirit. It is now said that Captain Hu has established contact with the regular army, so this unyielding and heroic guerrilla unit will be more powerful to assist, and will definitely be able to show better results.</p>
<p>Southwest Campaign Headquarters Promotes Second Phase of Highway Destruction, Strictly Orders Guangdong and Guangxi Battlefields to Comply, and Stipulates the Degree of Destruction of Each Road</p>
<p>Guilin News, the Southwest Campaign Headquarters authorities are now launching a general counter-offensive on the fronts in South China, but in order to consolidate Guangxi as the center of resistance, on the one hand, they have dispatched dozens of staff officers to inspect the strength of the troops on various fronts in the east, south, west, and north, the strength of the defenses, and the smoothness of traffic and transportation, and to collect local information in order to coordinate progress. On the other hand, they are implementing the second phase of highway destruction work and adjusting the guerrilla units on various fronts. The Lianbei Road (Guangzhou to Beihai), Qinyi Road (Qinzhou to Nanning), Tailing Road (Hepu to Lingshan), Suishi Road (Suixi to Shijiao), Dianmao Road (Dianbai to Maoming), and Xin Kai Road (Kaiping to Xin Yu) on the southern front, as well as the Wubo Road (Wulin to Bobai) and Rongcang Road (Yulin to Yuye) in southern Guangxi, as well as the roads in various towns and counties along the southeastern coast of Guangdong, will all be subject to the second phase of heavy destruction. All of the above roads that belong to the plains must be turned into paddy fields and returned to the original owners to grow rice, soybeans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. Those that belong to the foothills of the mountains must be destroyed into shear walls.

<p>Education News National Compulsory Education Overview, More than 18 Million Children Enrolled Before the War, Short-Term Two-Year Elementary Schools Established in Advance After the War</p>
<p>(Chongqing News) Regarding the situation of national compulsory education before and after the war, the following is an abstract of the reports of the responsible divisions and sections of the Ministry of Education, and the results of surveys and statistics:</p>
<p>Total Number of Students</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics on the number of school-age children in compulsory education in various provinces and cities in the 25th year, totaling 53,091,848. Currently, 18,285,129 are receiving education, accounting for 35.09% of the total number of school-age children. On average, there are 6.92 schools per 1,000 square miles, 38.33 enrolled children per 1,000 people, 1.75 grades per school on average, 57.38 children per school on average, 32.82 children per grade on average, and 26.13 children taught per teacher on average. The average annual cost per child is 6 yuan and 52 fen. The ratio of school-age children in each province and city is: Jiangsu more than 6 million, Sichuan 5.27 million, Shandong 4.54 million, Guangdong, Hebei, Henan, and Hunan each with 3 million plus, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei each with 2 million plus, Liaoning, Jin, Han, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Shaanxi each with 1 million plus, and the rest are mostly within millions or even tens of thousands. Of these school-age children who have already received education, Shanghai has the highest percentage of 72.59% of students receiving education (rounding), followed by Shanxi 69.49, Anhui 68, Hubei 63, Beiping 62, Hunan 60, Qingdao 58, Tianjin and Guizhou each with 57, Zhejiang 53, Chahar and Rehe each with 52, Shandong and Fujian each with 42, Suiyuan 40, Pingyuan 36, and Shaanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning each with 33, Qinghai and Henan each with 31, and the rest are in the twenties or teens. Xikang accounts for the least at 4.22%, and Xinjiang accounts for 2.07%. In the 26th year, the number of children enrolled in compulsory education in various provinces and cities was 21,435,254, an increase of 3,180,225 over the previous year. In the 27th year, although the war affected the provinces in the war zone, the number of children enrolled in schools in the provinces in the rear continued to increase.</p>
<p>Implementation Procedure</p>
<p>"Phase 1" from August of the 24th year to July of the 29th year, each province and city widely established one-year short-term elementary schools to enroll children aged nine to twelve, and promoted "junior elementary schools", enriched elementary schools, "existing grade enrollment", implemented "two-part system", improved "private schools", and piloted "itinerant teaching", so that by the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of children in the country will have received more than one year of education. "Phase 2" from August of the 29th year to July of the 33rd year, in addition to continuing to operate in accordance with the methods of the previous phase, all one-year short elementary schools will be gradually changed to two-year short elementary schools to enroll children aged eight to twelve, so that by the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of children will have received two years of compulsory education. "Phase 3" from August of the 33rd year, the two-year system should be gradually changed to a four-year junior elementary school, so that all children in the country will receive at least four years of compulsory education. After this plan is determined, all laws and regulations related to the plan will be formulated, announced, and implemented in detail.</p>
<p>Compulsory Education Funding</p>
<p>Compulsory education funding should be raised locally in principle, but the central government may provide appropriate subsidies to border and impoverished provinces and cities and other provinces and cities with special circumstances. (A) "Central Subsidies to Various Provinces and Cities for Compulsory Education Funding over the Years" In the 24th year, a total of 3.2 million yuan, in addition to 2.4 million yuan from the national treasury, including 500,000 yuan for border education expenses, and 300,000 yuan allocated from the Sino-British, Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer indemnity agencies. In the 25th year, a total of 4,575,000 yuan, in addition to 3.9 million yuan extracted from the education construction fund, including 500,000 yuan for border education expenses, and 175,000 yuan from the Sino-American, and Sino-French Boxer indemnity. In the 26th year, a total of 6,665,000 yuan, in addition to 5.9 million yuan extracted from the education construction fund, including 500,000 yuan for border education, and 265,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, and Sino-Belgian Boxer indemnity. However, in that year, the education construction fund was reduced to 70% from September due to the War of Resistance, and 10,000 yuan from the Sino-Belgian Boxer indemnity was not allocated, and the subsidies allocated to the provinces and cities in the war zone were also ordered to be stopped, so the actual amount could not be issued as scheduled. In the 27th year, a total of 1,741,000 yuan, in addition to 1,407,000 yuan listed in the education construction fund, including 224,000 yuan for border education expenses, and 110,000 yuan from the Sino-British, Sino-American Boxer indemnity. (B) "Compulsory Education Funding Raised by Various Provinces and Cities Themselves Over the Years" In the 20th year, the total amount of compulsory education funds raised by various provinces, cities, and counties in addition to the original funds was 10,070,059 yuan, exceeding the total amount of central subsidies by three times. In the 25th year, a total of 14,733,831 yuan, also exceeding the central subsidy by three times. In the 26th and 27th years, except for the provinces and cities in the war zone, the provinces in the rear were unable to do their best to raise funds due to the relationship between the War of Resistance, but they were generally able to make efforts to raise and maintain funds in accordance with the 25th year.</p>
<p>Facility Overview</p>
<p>In addition to "dividing elementary school districts", organizing compulsory education committees at all levels, "improving compulsory education administrative institutions at all levels", and training compulsory education administrative cadres, "increasing the number of schools and classes", a total of 25,901 short-term elementary schools and 11,974 short-term classes were added in various provinces and cities nationwide in the 24th year, 25,173 ordinary elementary schools were added, 211 ordinary elementary school grades were added, 773 two-part system were added, 129 simplified elementary schools were added, and 119 itinerant teaching groups were set up. In the 25th year, a total of 38,117 short elementary schools and 21,444 short elementary classes were added in various provinces and cities nationwide, 13,267 ordinary elementary schools were added, 295 ordinary elementary school grades were added, 1,916 two-part system were added, 161 simplified elementary schools were added, and 735 itinerant teaching groups were set up. In the 26th and 27th years, although compulsory education in the war zone was difficult to carry out, progress continued in the rear. As for the central government's "promotion of compulsory education during the war", in addition to drafting a two-year plan to establish short-term two-year elementary schools in advance and ordering the provinces in the rear to actively handle them, a plan for educational facilities in the occupied areas has been formulated for the provinces in the war zone, ordering the provincial education halls to formulate plans for implementation, and sending instructors to various war</p>

<p>Wu Feng Bleaching Factory Dividend Dispute: Labor and Management Reach Amicable Agreement; Labor Force Expresses Remorse for Being Fooled; Civil Suit Abandoned, Criminal Suit Withdrawn</p>
<p>Thirty workers, including Shan Zhangquan and Xiao Wenyuan, of the Wu Feng Machinery Bleaching, Dyeing, and Printing Factory previously claimed that the Wu Feng Factory had a surplus of over 600,000 yuan between 1934 and 1936. According to the factory's shareholder agreement, this should have been divided into forty shares, with the workers entitled to two and a half shares, calculating to over 37,000 yuan in dividends for the workers. However, the factory actually distributed only over 3,600 yuan to the workers, leading them to suspect the factory's new manager, Li Xiuyun, and shareholders Chen Shiqing, Xu Shenchu, Qin Shao Cheng, and ten others of</p>
<p>embezzlement.</p>
<p>Therefore, they hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special Court. Li Xiuyun and others also selected four lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Zhang Shewo, Wang Xintang, and Chang Dawei, to appear in court and defend them, stating that the Wu Feng Factory shareholders only agreed that if there was a surplus, it would be divided into forty shares, with thirty shares going to the shareholders and one share going to the workers. However, the manager would assess their daily diligence and allocate the dividends accordingly. The factory actually calculated a surplus of over 132,700 yuan, with the workers' share being one-fortieth, or just over 3,300 yuan. Manager Li Xiuyun had already distributed over 3,600 yuan to the workers, so the defendants had not only not embezzled anything from the workers but had also been benevolent and righteous. They also presented the partnership agreement and annual dividend ledgers as evidence. Judge Fu Lin ruled in the civil case that the plaintiffs should file a lawsuit in the civil court. The workers then filed a lawsuit based on accounting records. The defendants, Li Xiuyun, and others, again hired lawyers Chen Tingrui, Zhang Shewo, and Wang Xintang to defend them, vaguely stating that the shareholders' agreement had nothing to do with the</p>
<p>workers.</p>
<p>The Wu Feng Factory agreed to use one of its forty shares of profit as a bonus for the workers, but this was only a business gift from the factory to reward the workers, and there was no contractual relationship with the workers. There was no basis for the source of the debt, so the workers' lawsuit was without merit and should be dismissed, with the workers bearing the litigation costs. This case was heard by Civil Court President Li Wei, who was meticulous in his investigation and held three hearings before finally reaching a verdict, declaring that the plaintiff's lawsuit and request for provisional execution were both</p>
<p>dismissed.</p>
<p>The litigation costs were to be borne equally by the plaintiff and defendant. The judgment was several thousand words long, clarifying the facts and legal principles in detail. It was heard that after the workers lost the case, they realized they had been fooled and expressed remorse to the court, abandoning the appeal. They also voluntarily withdrew the criminal suit for embezzlement and requested that the other</p>
<p>party not file a counterclaim.</p>
<h3>Assassination Attempt on Yang Zaisan Case Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the 6th of this month, at around 12:00 noon at the Dongxin Bridge intersection, a Changshu native named Yang Zaisan was unsuccessfully assassinated by gunfire. Afterward, the shooter, Xu Zi, was apprehended and confessed that he was instigated by Xiong Guisong, who paid him 300 yuan to kill Yang. The case was heard again yesterday by Judge Zhang Minsheng in the First Criminal Court. The victim, Yang Zaisan, appeared in court and stated that Mao Lin, who was the former staff member, owed him a loan of 2,500 yuan and became angry when he asked for it. Mao colluded with Xiong Guisong to have him assassinated. According to the defendant, Xu Zi's confession, Commander Xiong (referring to Xiong Guisong) had a grudge against him, so Zhou introduced him to kill Yang. The court verified the statements and decided to postpone the hearing to May 1st for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Guan Hua Lane was Searched, and a Korean Drug Dealer was Arrested.</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, No. 3 Guan Hua Lane, Route Lafayette in the French Concession, was suddenly searched by personnel dispatched by the Japanese side, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession police. As a result, a Korean male drug dealer was arrested.</p>
<p>A Fire Broke Out in the Post Office Wharf Warehouse and Chinese Arsonists Were Arrested.</p>
<p>A major fire occurred on the 24th of last month at the Second Warehouse of the Japanese Post Office Shipping Company on Huangpu Road in Hongkou. At the time, the fire spread to the Japanese Consulate Police Department, resulting in losses of over 500,000 yuan. Afterward, Japanese detectives were dispatched to conduct a secret investigation, suspecting that the fire was started by a Chinese arsonist group. As of yesterday, the Japanese side announced that a Chinese youth named Chen Kangtai, allegedly the leader of the group, and eight other suspects had been arrested. Chen had confessed to participating in the arson, while the suspects were still being interrogated.</p>
<p>Crime Roundup: Widow Robbed of a Large Sum of Money</p>
<p>At around 12:00 noon yesterday, four thugs, using the excuse of delivering a letter, tricked their way into the residence of a local widow, Wang Yuzhen, at No. 22 Qingyun Fang, Route Paulun in the French Concession. They robbed her of valuables, jewelry, and clothing, estimated to be worth over 6,000 yuan. The robbers then fled with their loot. The victim filed a report with the Route Petain Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>At around 6:50 PM yesterday, six bandits broke into No. 333 Kangnuo Road in West Shanghai. Two of them were armed with pistols and prohibited any noise. They robbed 30 yuan in legal tender before fleeing.</p>
<p>At around 8:30 PM last night, three robbers arrived at No. 206 Liaoyang Road. Two of them were armed with pistols and used threats and intimidation to rob 70 yuan in cash. Before leaving, they fired a shot as a warning.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Administers Vaccinations</p>
<p>According to a report by the Director of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, many factory owners have recently requested the Health Department to vaccinate their workers against cholera. Therefore, the department has no choice but to send personnel to the factories to administer vaccinations according to the order of requests. If factories want to specify a date, it cannot be accommodated. Any factory that urgently needs to vaccinate its employees must hire its own doctor. The required serum can be requested from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department in writing, free of charge.</p>
<p>A Cross-Border Opium Trafficking Organization Was Uncovered, Over 2,000 Ounces of Opium Were Confiscated, and Thirty Criminals Were Arrested.</p>
<p>On the 25th, Chinese Detective Ye Yuxi, Detective Li Shugui, Detective Liu Zhaonian, Detective Zhao Bao, and Detective Guo Shouxin of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police uncovered a large-scale opium trafficking organization, arrested thirteen criminals, and confiscated over 1,000 ounces of opium, worth over 10,000 yuan. The details are as follows: At 1:50 PM on the afternoon of the previous day, detectives from the division learned that someone was selling opium in Room 32, Yong'an Hotel, No. 227 Fujian Road. They rushed to search the premises and arrested four people from Anhui Province, Wang Chunshan, Zhang Qingshan, and two people from Jiangbei, Qi Yufa and Li Chaochen, confiscating 200 ounces of opium. Afterward, officers arrested two accomplices from Pudong, Shen Linsheng and Lu A Gen. Based on the confessions of the accomplices, they went to Room 221, Dadong Hotel, Qiaqing Road, and arrested five more people, Hu Xiaodi, Zhang Jinbang, Pan Xiang_, Xu A Lin, and Xue Chufa. They then went to No. 15, Lane 1729, Avenue Edouard VII, and arrested a Cantonese man, Guo Ming. They seized eight hundred and twenty ounces of opium at No. 223 Sichuan Road. The main culprits in the case were identified as Cao Yongsheng and Li Qisheng. The police went to No. 1084 Avenue Robert to arrest them, but they were not found. Only Li's wife, Li Jiangshi, was arrested. They were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Bao_, stated the circumstances of the case, stating that because there were many criminals involved, it was necessary to investigate who was involved and who was not. Therefore, the case should be temporarily</p>
<p>detained</p>
<p>for further investigation to determine whether or not to prosecute. Those who are found to be uninvolved will be released in advance. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After Judge Feng's cross-examination, it was decided that the defendants would be temporarily</p>
<p>detained for one week for further questioning.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor, After reading yesterday's report in your newspaper titled "British Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill Workers Suddenly Arrested by the Japanese," I noticed that the list of representatives of the Workers' Mutual Aid Association included Xu Yanlun, Liu Rongji, Cai Sheng, Xu Guanche, Cai Ronghua, Tang Weisheng, and He Ying. The name "Liu Renji" was a mistake for "Cai Ronghua," who is specifically responsible for leading the workers. Please correct this. Sincerely, Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill Mutual Aid Association, April 25th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, Today's newspaper published a news item about the death of fur merchant Luo Senfei, stating that Mr. Luo Senfei had opened our company, which is completely untrue. Mr. Luo Senfei operated independently and was not a shareholder of our company. We are concerned that this news will mislead readers and damage our company. Please correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai Shenda Foreign Company, April 25th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, After our company sent out the news yesterday about a freight car from the Gonghe Transport Company being intercepted, we received a letter from the company stating that the company is purely organized by legitimate Changshu people who were stranded on the isolated island after the war and are engaged in land and sea freight transportation in Shanghai to maintain their livelihood. They have no dealings with the current "political police" in Changshu. The news of the interception is detrimental to our company's reputation and should be corrected. We are forwarding this to you and hope you will investigate and make the necessary corrections. Sincerely, Modern Communications Agency, Editorial Department, Shen Bao, April 25th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read a news item in your newspaper about the Xi Fu Industry Employees' Mutual Aid Association, which listed my humble name as an honorary president. I found this strange. I have never been involved with this association. Therefore, I am writing to request that your editor remove my humble name and make the necessary corrections. Wu Shan_ and Cai Bing_, April 25th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read a news item in the local news column of your newspaper on April 25th about a child who used a knife in a fight. There was an error in the description of my occupation. I am currently a civil servant in the Revenue Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Your newspaper mistakenly identified me as a worker. I am deeply regretful. I have always admired your newspaper for its accurate reporting and hope you will correct this. Sincerely, Zhang Fengchi, April 26th</p>

<p>The Return of the British Ambassador to Germany  Mao Lie</p>
<p>Regardless of why the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, is returning at this time, the "frank document" he carries with him upon his return is worthy of attention. It is said that the content of this document is "seeking peace," and at the same time, it is almost a "warning." This is somewhat comical.</p>
<p>Seeking peace is expressing goodwill, while warning has at least some threatening nature. Hitler is not a fool or a child; why would he submit to the enticement of sweets and the coercion of a whip? What else is this intention, this wording, if not comical?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I said that the original reason for Henderson's departure has now been whitewashed and made meaningless. Now, the British government is afraid that British-German relations are at a standstill—especially after Hitler's speech on the 28th of this month, which makes this possible—so they have no choice but to call Henderson back early to remedy this defect. As for carrying a document upon his return, I believe that whether it is seeking peace or warning, they know it is useless, but it is just a way to excuse themselves and use it as a reason for returning.</p>
<p>What will happen after the return? Of course, there will be no new tricks to play. The demonstrative departure has become a normal action, and the future exchanges between the two countries will still be the same: on the one hand, they will try to persuade the tiger to give up its skin, and on the other hand, they will turn a deaf ear and do what they want. Knowing this would happen today, they should have regretted it earlier. With today's return, the departure in the past may be a superfluous move! Such coming and going seems to be only comical: like it's a big deal, but actually it's no big deal at all!</p>
<p>Of course, I have no immediate intention in saying this. And I also know their difficulties and the reasons why they have to adopt this approach. I say this only to make people understand that the content of this event may be truly just this, and not to overestimate this "seeking peace" or "warning," thinking that it will achieve something. At the same time, I still hope that the British government, in addition to this kind of superficiality, will strengthen the anti-aggression alliance on the other hand and sincerely cooperate with the Soviet Union. This work should be stepped up.</p>
<p>Although Chamberlain is still saying: "Henderson's return will show that the government's policy has not changed and is not softening," we also give it considerable trust, believing it to be a sincere statement. However, we always feel that his "no change" and "no softening" are really not enough, and there is a need to strengthen the combined forces!</p>
<p>Burial Liu Lan</p>
<p>From the horizon rose the vast night curtain, covering the entire wilderness. The sky was like a black and boundless sea, with not a single star, not even a crescent moon. All were submerged in the bottom of the sea. Cold, desolate, quiet, only the night chill moved.</p>
<p>This place used to be a fertile field that released fragrance, and golden rice ears shook with the waves of abundance. In the morning and evening, wisps of blue smoke rose from the tops of thatched cottages, slowly blending into the milky white morning mist and the crimson sunset. The gurgling water surrounded the houses. It was a peaceful and tranquil village.</p>
<p>Now, quietly lying are ruins and broken tiles. The rugged land exhales a rotten smell, a bloody smell. Even the sounds of nature seem to be wailing. The world is buried under the heavy pressure of death.</p>
<p>A group of black shadows wriggled towards here, like a small snake, stubbornly crawling. Finally, they stopped and rested by a small stream. There were more than thirty men. They carried miscellaneous gun skills, such as the 38 rifle and the Mauser pistol. They wore various clothes, such as military uniforms and short jackets. They had different faces, square and round. However, people's hearts were not "as different as their faces." Belief and will forged the brothers into a piece of steel, and the struggle was an anvil, hammering them purer and stronger.</p>
<p>"Dead." Two brothers from the team who were carrying the body lowered the crude stretcher, touched the wounded man, and uttered these two simple words. The tone was melancholy and low. Passing through the night sky, this news twisted everyone's face, causing sorrowful spasms. Pain resided in the hearts of the entire team, like a crow perched on the top of a tower in the sunset, but it was not a gorgeous dusk, but a vast and dark night. Suddenly, a black door opened with a bang, and a tongue rolled out, swallowing a stubborn soul, one who had played with death all day long.</p>
<p>The team was shrouded in silence, and people did not speak. Three comrades silently dug a pit, one shovel after another, as if they were cutting at their own hearts.</p>
<p>The cold night wind caressed their faces, like playful, unknown insects, making people drowsy. However, these men were still like strange stones. Excessive grief had numbed people's senses.</p>
<p>Under the solemn gaze of more than sixty eyes, the martyred warrior returned to the earth. He was buried. Resentment burned in the chests of the living, and sparks of revenge burst forth in their hearts.</p>
<p>"Today, one comrade sacrificed in a battle. The death of a comrade will certainly make us sad, but sacrifice is unavoidable. We must have the courage to face death. Freedom and liberation must be exchanged with blood. For the eternal existence of the nation, we should not be stingy with our personal lives. Comrade ×'s death is glorious and great." The captain suppressed his emotions and said each word firmly and forcefully. "We should commemorate the martyred comrade with more tenacious and persistent resistance!"</p>
<p>The white dove in his heart was flapping its wings, wanting to fly out of the hole. The last sentence stirred the wings of the white dove, arousing the intention to fly.</p>
<p>In the deep night, the shadows wriggled forward again, finally disappearing into the endless night.</p>
<p>In the distant sky, the sharp sound of gunfire pierced the silence of the long night.</p>
<p>Occasional Mood Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>According to aesthetic theory, the entire process of creating beauty can be expressed in four stages: impression, expression, aesthetic pleasure, and translation of facts into phenomena. The beauty of literature seems a bit elusive, and no theory can be applied to it; however, we still cannot help but acknowledge that the so-called beauty of literature has at least an impression stage.</p>
<p>Due to this impression, we can go a little further to explore the author's mood. A beautiful scenery, a beautiful fact, or a beautiful object must be imprinted on a responsive heart in order to create a beautiful painting or a beautiful article. The English poet William Wordsworth once confused beauty and truth as the same thing, and even ancient Chinese literati often could not distinguish between beauty and truth. In fact, beauty is a ring, and truth is also a ring. When two rings are put together, they cannot be separated, but even though they are two rings, it is easy to confuse them as the same thing. Therefore, this feeling cannot be erased even now.</p>
<p>Where there is beauty, there must be ugliness. Beauty comes from a responsive heart, and ugliness comes from a heart that is not responsive. Not having responsiveness, to put it nicely, is lacking the ability to express beauty; to put it badly, is like gently stroking a corpse; the dead are already cold and stiff, how can they feel the goodwill of stroking? Eating fish requires eating fresh fish, and reading articles requires reading non-formulaic articles. These two things are barely similar.</p>
<p>If the soul is a numb thing, it cannot live. However, those with the ability will also "occasionally" have a mental breakdown and have an experience of "sudden enlightenment."</p>
<p>Whether there is such a thing as genius, I dare not say! Just like the lack of divinity in child prodigies, there is really no such thing as true genius. If there is, it is a person who has a sudden enlightenment from an occasional mental breakdown. Perhaps it can be considered good luck coming to the door, or a lucky star shining brightly; if they write smoothly, there will be an uncontrollable "occasional mood" to provide materials. Saying it is worthy of admiration, it still lacks respect.</p>
<p>One cannot "accidentally" succeed with an object, a memory, or even a cloud of fantasy. One can only accidentally see or accidentally think, which causes a reaction in the heart, slowly dissolving and slowly refining; then a masterpiece will be drawn from the pen and paper, and a beautiful literary monument will be established between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own opinions, and everyone has their own emotions; one should also respect one's own opinions and respect one's own emotions. To respect, one must first refine the opinions and emotions in one's mind so that they are refined and radiant before they are qualified to be respected. However, believers in "occasional mood" have never paid attention to how their brains work, and only know how to "occasionally" come up with a few "amazing performances" (I almost wrote "amazing theories"). It can be considered showing off, and it is also possible to seize the opportunity to become a hero. With a little mood, they hope to shock the world, overturn the Pacific Ocean, and collapse the Himalayas, so that they, the great hero who stands upright, can grab Gorky with one hand, step on Lu Xun with one foot, and blow out a thousand feet of light in one breath.</p>
<p>"Gradual enlightenment" may be a toy for fools; but is "sudden enlightenment" truly real? Even if it exists, will it stand firm in thought and never perish? "Gradual enlightenment" is a matter for the mentally deficient, but can't the mentally deficient be the tortoise in the tortoise and hare race?</p>
<p>The greatest wisdom may seem like foolishness, and I hope those with great wisdom will be humble. However, to say something that spoils the scenery: there is no great wisdom in the world, only fools who think they have great wisdom.</p>
<p>Road of Many Forks Ding Di</p>
<p>When boating on the winding Qujiang River with many islands, or driving on an ancient road with many crisscrossing ruts, a traveler often feels lost due to not knowing the direction and ends up on a road with many forks.</p>
<p>It is not a straight heavenly path without road signs or guides, and the sky is also very gloomy. Rain is coming from the mountains, and dark clouds fill the sky. You cannot climb high to see far, nor can you observe the details. You will have no heart to walk leisurely and calmly, and remain independent on the road with many forks. The livestock are tired, and you are also hungry and thirsty. You have to avoid being robbed by bandits and becoming a victim to wolves and tigers. You should stop to rest and find a place to stay for the night. Therefore, you have to choose a road that you should take from several roads with many forks.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own future, and everyone has a "rest stop." The livestock are tired, and people are also hungry and thirsty. Dusk is also approaching. You cannot stand still on the road with many forks and sleep in the wilderness. Therefore, travelers prop up their oars and shake their paddles, feed their horses and grease their wheels, and climb hills, cross wet meadows, rush over shoals, and wind around harbors. They also encounter headwaters and tailwinds, difficulties and plains, bird paths and sheep intestines, life and death, and fortune and misfortune.</p>
<p>The road is unpredictable. It is difficult to predict your comfort and hardship from the plains and dangers in front of you. A wise and upright traveler must not forget his future because of momentary comfort.</p>
<p>The road with many forks also determines the fate with many forks. Often, a happy road is buried in thorns, while an evil road is full of fruit juice. Friend, how will you choose your way?</p>
<p>Will you eat that fruit juice? Or will you let the thorns pierce your feet? There is no happy road from the beginning, no olives that are not sour, and no eternally peaceful life. Life, a temporary journey between heaven and earth, is it not also a changeable road with many forks? The torment of poverty, the whip of power, and the sweet enticement often make you lose your judgment. You cannot calm down and take care of your honor and disgrace, life and death, ancestors and descendants. Therefore, you enjoy the sweet fruit juice and abandon the thorns.</p>
<p>The present sorrow and joy are all illusory. Short-sighted people cannot see through the illusion, so they all experience the sorrow and joy of the moment.</p>
<p>Sorrow and joy are often impermanent. The present success may be the future frustration. The smooth road to success leads to being trapped in a quagmire; drinking the fruit juice leads to death from poison; those who are full of hope for a safe night's sleep may also be buried by wolves and tigers. A foolish smile still remains on the lips, and greed and momentary comfort have been exchanged for cruelty and misery.</p>
<p>Is there anything more changeable than the road of many forks in a fleeting world? Happy, miserable, dark, bright, upright, and evil roads are all laid out before you for you to choose. Each road has its own destiny. The road has many forks, and fate also has many forks. It is up to you to choose. You can bring disaster or fortune, leave a bad name for thousands of years, or leave a good name for generations.</p>
<p>Perhaps you clearly know that you are heading towards your future, but you are afraid to take a thorny road. People are tired, hungry, and the road is long. Your body is cold, and you have nothing to wear or eat. Naturally, you are powerless and tired. Naturally, you will grit your teeth and say fiercely, "Let's just do it," so you embark on the evil road. You say it is for life.</p>
<p>That's right, everyone has to live. You are living now by embarking on the evil road. Not only are you living, but you can also indulge in debauchery. You are satisfied with the present, but have you ever looked far into the distance, at the distant mountains and the other shore? Can you point out to me the joy beyond those few arrows, the final end?</p>
<p>You are happy, can I not be sad?</p>
<p>So I tremble and open my eyes to look at the heights and the distance. I discern the confusing roads. Finally, I find that there are only two: the present suffering and the present joy.</p>
<p>I find another peak and see even higher and farther. I still see two roads: eternal suffering and eternal joy. The present joy and suffering are not the same as the eternal, but are opposite.</p>
<p>The road of many forks also determines the fate of many forks. Choose, you and I should get on the road.</p>
<p>Rain is coming from the mountains, dark clouds fill the sky, and dusk is approaching again. Is it not the time when you are hungry, tired, and shaken?</p>
<p>The road of many forks is difficult to discern in the vastness. You must be careful in choosing where to go.</p>
<p>Post-War (Woodcut) Liu Yizui Liu You</p>
<p>This seems like a sweet smile, permeating people's souls, obscuring their reason, causing them to forget everything, and even forget themselves!</p>
<p>As if crazy, when people encounter that intoxicating dream, intoxicating wine, intoxicating smile, intoxicating song... and everything with bewitching magic, they are like entering a land of confusion, they love this intoxication, this intoxication containing poison.</p>
<p>However, people's hearts are so haggard that they cannot withstand the slightest anesthesia. When they are</p>
<h3>Anti-Aggression Front: Soviet Proposal Has Broader Scope; Britain Believes It Cannot Be Implemented at Present; Has Been Circulated to France, Poland, and the Three Baltic States for Reference</h3>
<p>(Paris) The content of the Soviet counter-proposal is being kept secret by officials. However, it is known here that the counter-proposal does not involve the Far East, but its scope is broader than the original Anglo-French proposal, which only involved the Three Baltic States. (Reuter's dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here have announced that the government is continuing negotiations with relevant countries regarding the organization of an anti-aggression bloc. The Soviet government's recently proposed counter-proposal advocates that countries mutually accept constraints, clearly targeting Germany. The government has circulated the proposal to France, Poland, and Romania, along with several comments, requesting that these countries study it. It is generally said that this counter-proposal, in its current form, is impractical. The British government will still ask the Soviet Union to consider its original proposal, namely that the Soviet Union provide guarantees, declaring that if any neighboring country is subjected to aggression and seeks Soviet assistance, then the Soviet Union will provide assistance to the extent specified by the invaded country. This is because Poland and Romania are both unwilling to directly establish an agreement with the Soviet Union. The British original proposal, accepted by the Soviet Union, is a unilateral constraint and is welcomed by these countries. In addition, the British government is also encouraging Romania to enter into a military agreement with Poland to supplement the deficiencies of the current guarantee agreement. It is said that the discussions that the authorities have been conducting with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu in recent days have involved this matter. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) During the session of the House of Commons this afternoon, Riley, a Labour Party member of the opposition, asked whether the government would negotiate a joint defense agreement with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to curb aggression. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied in the negative. Labour Party member Baker then asked whether the government recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Prime Minister Chamberlain avoided answering. Another Labour Party member, Sorensen, raised a question regarding the suggestions contained in President Roosevelt's telegram. Prime Minister Chamberlain then replied that the raw materials produced by the British colonies were, in practice, available for purchase by any other country. Therefore, the British government would be happy to consider any suggestions aimed at improving the distribution of raw materials. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>British-Romanian Negotiations Yield Concrete Results; Britain Also Provides Financial Assistance; Poland Also Offers Guarantees to Romania</h3>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax at the Foreign Office this afternoon, and it is reported that [tangible progress] has been made. The main issue discussed by both sides was the Soviet government's counter-proposal on organizing an anti-aggression bloc. According to Romanian sources here, Poland has offered guarantees to Romania, declaring that the current alliance treaty between the two countries applies not only to aggression from the Soviet Union, but also to aggression from all other quarters. If this is the case, then this alliance treaty is already very strong and does not need to have any connection with the future anti-aggression alliance. Regarding the outcome of the talks between the British and Romanian ministers, it is said that an official communique will be issued tomorrow. Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to travel to Paris tomorrow afternoon at 4:30, accompanied by Romanian Minister Tilea, to hold talks with the French government authorities, and then proceed to Rome for a trip. It is generally known that he will endeavor to mediate between France and Italy to resolve their disagreements and reconcile them. In addition, according to sources in Rome, Foreign Minister Gafencu will also travel to the capital of Yugoslavia to advise the country to adhere to the Balkan Entente Pact. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Reuter's diplomatic correspondent, there is reason to believe that an agreement has been reached on a method for Britain to provide Romania with various facilities under the export credit scheme, so that Romania can effectively increase its exports to Britain. It is also believed that the issue of supplying Romania with armaments will be discussed. In addition, general European situation and the special circumstances of the Balkans, as well as the situation arising from Britain's guarantee to Romania, have also been thoroughly reviewed. It is reported that Britain and Romania have agreed that, at present, Romania has no reciprocal obligations for Britain's guarantee. The two sides also discussed the complex situation of the current British-Soviet discussions and Romania's attitude towards accepting Soviet military assistance. (Reuter's dispatch, 25th)</p>
