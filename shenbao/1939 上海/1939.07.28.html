<h3>美國外交重大舉動　美日商約宣告廢止　制裁先聲日本驚愕證劵大跌　華方認爲道義上最偉大援助</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國政府己決定將一九一日年美日兩國通商航海條的、宣告廢止、此項驚人消息、係於昨日晚間十時許發表、其時國務院情報處主任召集各報訪員、分別授以公報、內開、美國政府為本國在遠東所保有之利益、獲有較周密之保護、幷予以發展起見、特決定將一九一一年美日兩國通商航海條的、宣告廢止、依照本的規定、美國政府此種決定、當於通告後六個月、即一九四〇年一月二十六日發生效力云、因此參議院外交委員會主席畢德曼所提禁止以軍火與各項原料品運往日本一案、一俟國會明年一月間復會之後、即可提付討論、蓋商的規定、彼此不得岐視對方，而畢德曼提案則與此項規定相抵觸云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於美國政府通知廢棄美日通商航海條約事、堀內大使致外務省之公電、己於二十七日午後三時抵達、外務省待根據該項報告、慎重研究美國政府眞意之後、再乘適當時機、講求適切有效措置、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）美國駐日代辦杜曼根據本國政府訓令、特於今日正午訪問外務省美國局長吉澤、正式通知美國決定廢棄現行美日通商航海條的、並說明其理由、蓋因最近日本棉紗製品之對美輸入、極為旺盛、美國方面經考慮種種防衛對策結果、乃接受民間方面之要求、而採取此項措置云、吉澤局長對此一方面接受此項通知、一方面則聲述美國此種突然處置、不得不認為對日挑戰行為、故今後美國方面縱或提議締結新條的、然苟此種態度不拋棄、則將不能獲得滿意結果、促美方反省云、（二十七日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）此間聞美國宣布廢止一九一一年美日通商航海倏約後、第一反響厥為驚愕、日本初以為七月十八日共和黨領袖參議員樊登堡在參院所提出之議案、純為國內政治作用、不致見諾實施、日本向認美國忍耐、遂誤解其對日態度、今美國政府當局忽出此驟然手段、已將宣傳已久對美態度之誤解、打碎無遺矣、日本證券市塲接此消息後、市價驟落、證券有落去日金二圓者、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今日此間對於美國決定廢棄對日商的消息、均極感愉快、美國此項決定、雖須以六個月後發生效力、但一般人皆認其或為任何列強所能給予中國最偉大的道德上之鼓勵、重慶在此事宣佈前、已接有情報、謂美國將有某種表示、脫離英國在遠東之綏靖政策、各觀察家皆認美國此舉、在心理方而實屬極巧妙之行動、將使華人對於美國之友誼、發生最深刻之印象、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>照會全文</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關於一九一一年美日兩國通商航海條約宣告廢止事、赫爾國務卿昨以照會送達日本大使堀內、內開、「數年以來、美國政府嘗就本國與各國所簽訂之通商航海條的、加以研究、從而設法加以修正、俾此項條約原來目標、得以易於達到、旋卽獲有結論、以為一九一一年二月二十一日美日兩國在華盛頓所成立之通商航海條的、載有某種條款、須當從新加以考慮、茲為預事籌備並適應時局進展之必要、俾美國利益獲有較周密之保護、曁予以發展起見、特依照本約第十七條規定、向貴國政府通知宣告廢止之意、自今而後、本的與附屬議定書、應自本年七月二十六日起六個月以後、滿期失效」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>中英新借款　仍在談判　簽字說言之過早</h3>
<p>（倫敦）華人方面所傳、英國以三百萬鎊之新出口信用放款借與中國、業於上星期簽字、今日此聞加以吾認、據謂此項談判進行數月、但迄未結東、並無簽字情事（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>紀念郵票　贈美總統</h3>
<p>（重慶）交通部長張家璈、以中國郵票三十套、送交此問美大使館、轉贈總統羅斯福、國務卿赫爾、及郵務部長法萊、此種郵票、係中政府發行之紀念郵票、以紀念美政府成立第一百五十週年紀念者、票面三分五分二角五分五角及一元四種、正中為中國地圖、飾以巾美國旗、此種郵票已發出一千萬套、在中國各處出售、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>中日開戰以來　最驚人之發展　英日商約亦將廢止</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據今日可靠方而消息、英國為與美國在遠東方面採取一致行動計、今日對一九一一年之英日商的、亦圖予以終止、聞英政府廢止此的時、將給予日本以一年之期限、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國照會日本取銷美日商的、可謂與中日戰爭有關最大驚人事件、蓋以其緊接羅斯福總統於中立法爭案為參院所擊敗、美國孤立派之實力有恢復微象而發也、各報雖尚未載文批評、但晚報對此消息、皆大書特書、政界現拒絕發表意見、懂謂現尚未接取銷該的之正式消息、而其效果亦宜慎加考慮云、路透社就中英日三方面徵集意見如下、華人皆大為歡忭、謂彼等在開戰之始、即料美國早遲必有舉動、今果信然、英人意見以為美國之舉動必有良好之影響及於東京談話、日禾商界皆恐取銷之照會、幾與實行取銷之效果相同、因美國商界將疇躇與日商訂結合同、蓋不知來年一月問之地位將如何也、若干觀察家現恐日本軍界之極端派或將利用此機會、迫令日本與德義締結軍事聯盟、餘者益於樂觀、謂日本倚賴美國接濟廢鐵汽油、二者皆作戰所必需、故信取銷美日商的、大可開始最後和平之門戶、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國政府將一九一一年美日雨國通商航海條的予以宜告廢止後、此間國會中人聞悉之餘、均極欣幸、咸謂、「　日美國政府對於在金融上援助中國以穩定法幣一事、拒不與英法兩國合作、會經引起不良印象、茲已完全消釋、抑美國此舉尚有特殊意義、則以英日兩國現行商約亦於一九一一年成立、英國政府遇有必要時、或可步美國之後塵、予以宣告廢止、關於此層、政府方面尚未考慮及之、但政界人士堅稱、英國當局決不聽任東京談判越出天津地方事件範圍以外、加之日本軍用品主要來源、將有斷絕之虞、（指美國國會將於明年一月間討論畢德曼提案）、此層不難壓迫日本令其就範」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>英對日妥協　議員紛紛質問　外務次官聲明　已無軍火運日</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本月午後開會時、議員數人會就金融上援助中國問題提出詢問、外務部次官勃特勒當卽在答辭中、重行申明、英國對華政策並未變更、反對派工黨議員麥克廉問、日本對華作戰目標、是否為英國政府所承認、今後英日談判、是吾以中國廣大土地淪陷於日軍之手、受日本管轄一項原則為根據、勃特勒决官答曰、吾、麥克廉又間、英日兩國談判所涉及之土地、旣不屬於英國、亦非日本所有、則進行談判、其故安在、勃特勒决官答稱、某某種事實、縱使極不稱意英國政府有時亦不得不予以考慮、反對派工黨議員漢德森問、英日初步協定成立之後、英國是否因此不復在法理上承認中國政府、而　續予以金融上之援助、勃特勒决官答稱、英日協定並非英國對華一般政策變更之謂、此層已由張伯倫首相聲明在案矣、漢德森又謂、日本外務省發言人曾經發表談話、謂英國常不復在金融上援助巾國、此層應請政府予以注意、勃特勒决官乃又再度提供保證、謂英國對華政策、並未變更、反對派工黨議員亞歷山大問、日本封餓政策、茲已推行及於沙面、未知曾向日本政府提出交涉吾、勃特勒次官答稱、「全部問題、正在考慮中、工黨議員麥克廉又就天津程鍚庚案四華籍嫌疑犯問題提出詢問云、「各該嫌疑犯審鞠之權、豈不屬於中國法庭、而非英日雙方所得越俎代庖歟」、勃特勒决官對於此點、並未作答、謹謂、在日方提出新證據之前、各該嫌疑犯決不引渡、反對派工黨議員撲萊斯問、各國曾吾採取必要措置、以阻止軍械售予日本、勃特勒决官答稱、除美國政府曾向各飛機廠勸告、勿以飛機售予日本而外、其他各國均未公開作何表示、以英國而論、自一九三八年二月四日以還、政府對於日本並未發出軍火出口許可證、至以德國而論、正以大批軍火售予中國云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日報解嘲</h3>
<p>（東京）日本各晚報對於美國宣告廢止一九一一年美日商約一事、認爲有傷兩國之好感、日本政界人士稱、美國政府所以欲廢止商約者、當　準備禁止美商將軍火軍需售運日本、而日本經濟方面人物則認美國廢的寓有在經濟上向日本挑釁之意、想美國政府於採取此步驟前、巳與央國政府先事磋商、其動機乃欲增強英翻在東京談判時之聲勢、而予日本以精神上之打擊云（二十七日海通電）</p>
<p>（東京）中外商業新聞引去年美日貿易統計為證、據謂、日本購入美國油·鐵·銅·與原棉等物、其價日金九一五、三五三、〇〇〇元、而日本售與美國之日貨、如生絲·罐頭食物·棉布·磁器等、祇值日金四二五、一二三、〇〇〇元、該報又謂、因絲貨為美人生活中所不可少者、故美人工作於絲業者達二十萬人、想美政府亦不能強令日絲輸入之大减、商的廢止後、大的軍火對日輸出之禁令、將繼之而起云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英日四次會議</h3>
<p>（東京）外務省情報部發表、第四次日英會談、七月廿七日午前九時四十五分起、至午後一時為止、又午後四時起、至六時卅分為止、兩度在外務次官邸一舉行、午前一决將將來所一可執行之警察手續之細目、討論告一段落、午後一决、則審議經濟問題、下决會談定於明廿八日午前十時起舉行（二十七日同盟電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國廢止美日商約</h3>
<p>陰霾四蔽，風雨凄厲，似天將墜，似陸將沉，鬼影憧憧，似人類將毀滅，乃於此際，霹靂一聲而得豁然開朗；以此方之美國政府突於前晚宣告廢止美日商的所影響及於整個國際現象曁其過去未來者謂不相酷肯耶！</p>
<p>美日現行商的訂於一九一一年，迄今行之閱二十八載；以友好平等互惠為基礎，以通商通航為範疇；此决廢止之宣告，在華盛頓七月二十六日之晚，即上海二十七日之晨；廢止之手續，由美國政府正式通告日本政府；廢止之理由，「欲使美國利益獲得更善之保障」；廢止之實行，應自宣告日起滿六月，即始於一九四〇年一月二十六日。</p>
<p>以商的之廢止，就商的之本體，論美日兩國之商業航業，及與之息息相關，渾然一體之農業工業，與夫國家財政，國民經濟，乃至一般社會之日常生活，則商的之存廢，所關者無以喻其大，可論者無以喻其多；姑莫謂縱論及此猶非當前之最亟，抑亦非報端短論所得而暢其說。况此國此日而有此舉，其意義，其關係，允遠逾於商的之範疇。請概陳之。</p>
<p>在前晚美國政府宣布廢止美日商的之前，美國朝野議諭及此者，一年以來，頗多其人，然與今茲措施並無直接關係；證以匝月之前，美國當局對於援用對德國商品徵收特稅之成法，以施之日本，猶主鄭重將事而遲疑未行，可顯見也。一旬之前，美國國會議員有建議廢止美日商約者，然與今茲措施，亦無直接關係：蓋議案尚未經過審查，尚未列入議程，遑論表決通過而成法案；更證以國務卿赫爾氏數日前所以答復質詢者，猶謂本屆集會殆議不及此，且待來年，可顯見也。於是知此决宣布廢的，確為適應最迫切之現狀而毅然為之，絕非數日前乃至數月前之預定計盡。昨日路透社華府電稱之為驟然而來，出人意表，不啻炸彈之爆發；如是云云，良有以也。雖然，此就舉動言之耳；若言大體，則美國利益備受侵蝕，備受歧視，美日締立商的之精神與基礎，早已為日方所背棄；則今茲廢的，雖謂當然之措施可也。而美國政府於遠東事變發生之後，數年以來，無論發為宣言，為牒文，為抗議，每决必提示其保障美國利益之決心，聽者雖藐藐，言者固諄諄；則今茲廢的，雖謂屢經預吿後之措施可也。舉動突然，性質非突然。</p>
<p>美國此舉之影響於整個國際之現象與今後國際大局之趨勢者，必有客觀而具體之事實，將於最近之將來，漸决予天下後世以共見；是則決非吾人之奢望，亦無取於今日之預言。蓋事有所必然者，勢在所不可抗；然為痛快而預言某一糾紛，某一問題，是則徒以刺激有損無益之情感，固可以已者也。其得泛論者；美國近於國會討論中立法事，頗見政黨政治之弱點，亦見總統羅斯福氏為政爭所困；然此决突然宣告廢止美日商的，乃為朝野兩大黨對於外交政策絕對一致之明證；原美國在野之共和黨參議員范登堡氏等，既有不以外交政策為政爭工具之宣言，而所謂孤立派者，自政治言則不盡以黨籍為畛域，自宗旨言則對歐洲問題堅主孤立，而對於遠東及臘丁美洲則多主積極；是以此决措施，絕非當局之乾綱獨斷，實以美國之全國全力為之後盾者也；此應體認者一也。數年以來，自遠東而斐洲而歐洲，侵略國家之作為，幾乎無往而不利，侵略國家之氣燄，幾乎莫敢攖其鋒，於是其欲愈奢，其勢愈張；所忌憚者美國，所諂事者美國，以為敬而遠之，必不復為我梗；誠以美國之國力與地位，在國際確乎舉足重輕，絕非任何侵略國家乃至侵略集團所得與之較量；而此决毅然出此措施，謂為廢止美日兩國商的之宣告，甯謂決心制止遠東侵略之宣告；行見「貪夫廉」！此對症下藥者二也。淪亡於侵略者，不一其國，徒博世人同情之熱淚而已；顧有國焉，拚萬難，忍慘痛，為抵禦暴力，為保衛獨立自由而抗戰，為正義而犧牲，亦為友邦共通利益而首當其衝，此所以維繫世人搖搖欲墜之正義信心者，具有無上價值；然抗戰兩年所貢獻於世人者，以英國在東京之一屈膝而幾乎使世人懷疑於正義之墜地至不可收拾；而今美國之措施，既使抗戰者自信允深，使一般人正義感復蘇，抑且於此迫切之時機，可以使「懦夫立！」此倒挽在瀾者三也。</p>
<p>嗚呼！人類固應以自由平等為生活原則之文明動物也；及至近年，凡能反自由而尚桎梏者，能反平等而尚征服者，方行其反文明之道；風行草偃，卑怯者相率而低首下心，或受桎梏，或受征服，或靦覥而謀獨善其身，從旁阿附於桎梏若征服，坐視自由平等之趨於落沒。美國今日之登高一呼，發聾振瞶，證明人類固猶得為文明之動物也。國際固應以互尊主權，互尊獨立為秩序者也，及至近年、相率企圖以暴力破壞一切，以暴力主宰一切；充極其量，惟有以暴力為無軌道之軌道。而美國今日之作為，固澄淸國際，恢復秩序之發軔，亦奠定秩序之基本工作也。是文明之歷史的措施，亦國際之歷史的措施也。物極必反，期不在遠；顧於將反未反之間，或為暴者肆其最暴，以謀最後掙扎之期間乎？是則有志於發揚人類文明，恢復國際秩序者所應全神戒備而合力應付之者也。</p>
<h3>羅斯福決定廢約　美國史上殆屬創舉　維護權益反對侵略　此係禁運軍火先聲</h3>

<h3>金融　狂漲暴落　現金曾出四千元關　美日商的取消頓起反動</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、情勢仍飄忽不定、大致先在漲而後傾跌、高低差額、距離一百七十五元、初開因聞匯豐吃胃較供意為佳、匯市步緊、大宗心理向榮、初時雖錢兌業傾向塞出、無如證券帮與某銀樓爭前猛吸不已、加以某錢兌業在高漲時、止塞力進、市象更堅、一度曾高達四千〇十五元頂盤、嗣以路透社電訊、美日商約取消、再以外匯內盤回硬、瘴烟之氣、頓形消散、一般經營者均急轉移目標、互相傾向了結、然買者在回跌之際、均裹足不前、迨至晚收竟回低至三千八百六十五元、但結果尚續漲七十元、中途頗多曲折、但尚無過大波瀾、交易因受籌碼及現鈔關係、零多躉少、全天的一千餘兩、銀樓飾金亦先漲後跌、一度大同行會創四百〇五元之空前高價、終則掛高五元、海關金仍平、中英純金等均續上升、</p>
<p>烚赤尚高漲七十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初時經營者、因鑒報載平準基金委員會將不再維持淪陷區域外匯之說、且其時聞匯豐對於內盤匯市有吃胃而無供意、人心更形向榮、開市即抬高六十五元、銀樓帮進金號十兩、價三千八百六十元、時某錢兌業忽來力塞百餘兩、致一度回挫、某錢兌業賣予某銀號五十兩、價三千八百五十元、繼又塞予銀樓帮三十兩、價三千八百四十元為當日最低價、此後雖某錢兌業仍有賣意、無如外匯步緊、引起買風、某銀樓（代港方投機商）及證券帮競相吸收、市勢頓轉上騰、不久即衝出三千九百元大關、證券帮進銀樓帮十兩、價三千九百二十元、後某錢兌業又來猛售百餘兩、故價回入三千九百元關內、某錢兌業賣予某銀樓（代港方投機家）五十兩、價三千八百六十元、但不旋踵旣聞外匯帶緊、且證券帮再度吸收、加以某錢兌業亦止塞力進、漲風頓復激烈、叉飛升百元、重衡出三千九百元關外、某錢兌業進銀樓帮共二十兩、價三千九百六十元、時巳午刻、後某錢兌業叉進銀樓帮十兩、三千九百五十元為午收價、午後因聞外匯美金巳軟三八元、故市勢更堅、開市即　六十元、竟衝出四千元大關、錢兌業進金號二十兩、價四千〇十元、繼又抬高五元、錢兌業進現金號三十兩、價四千〇十五元為當日高峰、時一度盤旋於四千〇十元、與四千元之間、二時半光景、因聞美日商務協定取消、外匯遂轉鬆硬、市價頓起反動、證券帮與現金號競相爭前力塞、加以銀樓帮亦跟踪套賣、一時進者均懷觀望、接連打破叫千元及三千九百元大關、現金號賣予錢兌業卅雨、價三千八百六十元、後錢兌業互做五十兩、三千八百六十五元為晚收價、結果較上日尚續漲七十元、（聞收後證劵帮又售予現金號十兩、價三千八百六十元）、查己連漲四天、共計三百九十五元、全天一百七十五元上落、現令號之本牌金售價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢稍有成交、</p>
<h3>進口商競相扒結　英美滙一度猛緊</h3>
<p>外匯咋日市况、匯豐掛牌、仍無上落，英美匯暗市、則頗多變幻、初時因鑒當日報載、平準基金委員會、將不再維持黑市、故一般進口洋行界、恐慌甚厲、紛紛競相猛扒、兼華商紗花帮與日銀行等亦來活動、加以英行匯豐對於現貨頗少塞出、而吃胃殊佳、以致市勢頗緊、一度英金最緊會喊過四辨士〇六二五、美匯亦呌過七元八七五、後以路透社電訊美國參議院已通過廢除日美在一九一一年所訂之商業條的、致扒者頓懷觀望、加以港電與孟買銀公司突來湧塞不休、故結果緊勢尚稱不劇、午刻聞英行有利會了結本月而套進八月、計貼出美余八七五、的合月息（除佣）一角一分半光景、交易尚旺、至港匯緊勢頗銳、聞賣價已軟至二十八允五角、</p>
<p>外銀行供給殊淡薄</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均縮一八七五、紐約銀價呆定、倫敦生金大半辨士、匯兌英對美小三毫、對滬跌一二五、對法仍平、美對英勿動、對滬縮一角五分、對法未更、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辨士三四七五、美匯八元四三七五、較上日午收、均無上落、開後出口商首先塞予匯豐現貨英四辨士三七五、嗣進口各貿易洋行、前來扒結、無如匯豐供意殊淡、而吃胃則佳、但對於八月期則稍有塞出、故市勢步軟、迨匯掛牌揭曉、悉無變動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免徵、此後洋行結進某行現貨美匯八元三七五、十時半後、洋行結軟仍多、且華商如紗花帮等、亦紛來活動、致市氣更緊、洋行又扒進有利現貨英金四辨士二五、繼而投機家扒結某行現貨美匯八元二五、同時又購進匯豐八月份英金三辨士八一二五、將近午刻、稍有掉期買賣、英行有利曾塞出七月而套進八月、計貼予套利者美金八七五、的合月息（除佣）一角一分半強、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金僅四辨士一八七五、美匯祇八元一二五、聞收後華商紗花帮吸進華比現貨美匯祇八元、同時英金亦軟至四辨士一二五、</p>
<p>港方午後復有塞出</p>
<p>後市初開、市勢仍緊、日行曾扒結某行現貨美匯仍為八元、時外電突傳美日在一九一一年所訂之商的、已告取消、故投機商與洋行等扒風頓戢、加以外電如港方及孟買銀公司均前來競相拋塞、故價逐漸回硬、計港電與孟買銀公司相繼塞予洋行與外行現貨英金由四辨士一六二五、硬至二一八七五、港匯約二十八元五角、結果比上日午收、英續緊一五六二五、美又軟二五、港亦約縮二元一二五（聞收後英金）又硬至四辨士二一八七五、美匯亦鬆至八元二一八七五、）</p>
<p>飾金曾懸四〇五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百八十五元、迨至九時四十分掛高五元、逾五分叉大五元、十時〇五分回落五元、十一時四十分又漲五元、逾十分又高五元、下午二時十二分再高五元、時大同行懸四百〇五元、為有市以來之最高紀錄、三時〇八分回下五元、三時十二分又回低五元、三時四十分再同小五元、此後無變化、結果掛高五元、大同行改懸三百九十元、新同行為三百八十八元、收進無一定價格、</p>
<p>英純金再漲半便士</p>
<p>二十六日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊續疲、故每盎斯再高起半辦士、計升達七鎊八先令六辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦昂達一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨漲三角、計一千二百〇七元九角、</p>
<p>香港申匯續見上升</p>
<p>香港二十七日電、今日匯市、開盤平穩、對英無變動、對美現貨不動、遠期鬆〇六二五、申匯升五元、日匯平、十時五十分堅穩、對英現貨鬆〇六二五、為一先令二便士六八七五、遠期不動、十一時二十分申匯又升五元、為百三十四元、下午二時三十分不動、三十五分申匯再升十元、為三百五十元、後收回降十元、仍為三百四十元、</p>
<p>聯鈔暗盤九十四元</p>
<p>天津二十七電、今日匯市、開盤不定、對英縮二五、為三便士一二五、對美緊半元、為六元〇六二五、申匯升四元、為一百四十元有行無市「聯鈔」暗盤昂七元、為九十四元、</p>
<h3>外幣上漲仍烈</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外匯甚軟、烚赤上漲劇烈、需要甚殷、市價高騰、午後聞美日商的廢止、供給趨暢、市况轉定、結果英美金鎊、英美金票、高漲甚多、果能國際時局好轉、外幣有鬆動回落希望、日金票需要未旺、漸趨鬆勢、晚市為一元一角五分半、朝鮮票復呆、晚市仍為九角五分、公會交易頗盛、鴻昌出美金鎊一百個、英金鎊二百個、仁泰出香港票一千元、森泰出香港票五百元、祥豐出香港票一千元、盈豐出美金票三十元、俱由泰和與買進、昨日市價、英金鎊升三元五角、英金票升二元六角、美金鎊升二元、美金票升六角七分、香港票升一角六分、法郎票升五厘、新加坡票荷蘭票各升三角、安南·羅比·斐律濱票各升二角、坎拿大票升七角、澳金票升二元、僅三種外幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現又高卅五元</h3>

<h3>英印銀價續疲</h3>
<p>二十六日倫敦電、銀市印度及投機家賣出、有人補空、市面平疲、收盤後仍平、印度則稍來補空、大條銀近遠期均縮一八七五、紐的銀電、美現貨呆定如故、又孟買銀電、印銀市况疲軟、現期貨均續降四安那、成交單祗五十張云、</p>
<h3>證劵　遠東銀股見升　中國內債仍疲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨因連漲兩日後、復又趨疲、黃金與貼水繼統上騰、漫無止境、一般人對於匯劃票據之信仰益形薄弱、公債背面、即係滙劃、而其環境叉受種種包圍、故愈形抬頭不起、塲上交易大都抱薄利即結宗旨、投資者極為稀少、且其趨勢每逢進出稍鉅時、買進不易抬高、賣出則易於下瀉、與六月上半月之情形、適成反比例、四週陰霾不散、欲冀上漲殊屬非易、樹欲靜而風不息、可謂多事之秋矣、昨日交易愈見遜色、買賣均未見踴躍、聯和同康等號稍有補進、松茂則出多進少、而北帮仍在賣出、如十四號及德孚又八號及同裕均有脫手、升降範圍益小、結果除甲種平穩外、餘均回小一角至六角、成交總數的計四十萬左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　五二·二〇五一·二〇五二·〇〇　平</p>
<p>統乙　四三·四〇四二·八〇四三·四〇跌〇·一〇</p>
<p>統丙　四二·〇〇四一·四五四一·八〇又〇·五五</p>
<p>統丁　四一·三〇四〇·五〇四一·〇〇又〇·六〇</p>
<p>統戊　四一·七〇四一·一五四一·三五又〇·六〇</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華書局股一百八十股、價為二十六元四角云、</p>
<p>衆業公所報告、昨本市各項股票皆續顯疲弱、但市上未見有賣戶擁擠、而祇因結進七月份外滙之戶、須於下星期一需款了結、是日又適為本所之交割日、因外匯轉遠期之行情更高、逼之將易於脫手之股票求售得款、是以各股價均下落、而收盤市氣甚疲、茲將開盤價格與收盤價格之比較列後、</p>
<p>開盤　收盤</p>
<p>電車股　四十二元七角五分　四十一元半</p>
<p>怡和股　十九元一角　十八元半</p>
<p>電話股　十二元六角　十一元八角</p>
<p>電力優　一百二十元　一百十七元半</p>
<p>先股</p>
<p>日前之新低價、今父復見、如國際信託股價三元二角半、會德豐股價二十九元半、及耶松股一百十二元、橡皮股亦受此影響、價仍見穩、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十六日（週三）掛牌行市、漲多跌少、麥加利銀行股升二先令六便士、價為六鎊十二先令六便士、匯豐銀行股各升半鎊，英倫註冊股為七十八鎊半、香港註冊股為七十八鎊、古拉容林傍橡皮股回落一便士半、價為十二先令十便士半、中國外債行市無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　利多空氣濃厚　紗市買風復熾　日紗套利不少</h3>
<p>紗市轉升、藍以黃金復漲、謠諑紛紜、謂外滙傳言叉盛、實需雖淸、人心受利多空氣之籠罩、實風復熾、二十支雙馬現出高價、會見五百六十一元、惟華南需要大為减少、午後聞匯票續縮、暗盤交易較午前趨漲、十十支雙馬棧單價為五百五十五元、二十支特金城又見新高峯價、為六百三十元云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因流言允盛、人心一致看好、開價尚平、漲三四元、二十支雙馬外棧貨價為五百五十七元、惟棧單貨較為佾利、做開價為五百四十五元、加五六元、但實需平平、香港帮納胃殊狹、市象尚屬和平、但一般從業者看漲、心思頗為濃厚、復來收買、加之消息良好、再趨前進、收盤二十支雙馬外棧價為五百六十元、棧單價為五百四十六元半、查半日成交八百〇五包、又上日午後成交九十包、行情二十支雙馬漲六元、牧羊漲三元半雙地球漲七元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城一百二十包、價為六百三十元、香港帮去、今日有棉紗一千二百五十件運香港、一百二十件運北海、一百二十件運廣州灣、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　五七〇　香港　二三五</p>
<p>統計　八〇五</p>
<p>日紗市面大漲、本月份貨漲風允熾、但實需未見十分發展、人氣殊強、查其堅挺之因素、該紗市面積疲已久、且本月份與下月價相差太遠、引起一般人套利、於是形勢一緊、漲力愈強、二十支月琴現出價為叫百二十七八元、漲十四元、下月份價為四百四十二元、但滙劃貼水仍昂、</p>
<h3>日廠採辦印棉　均係現鈔交易</h3>
<p>印棉交易、日廠採辦獨健、進一千八百件、且均係鈔票送廠、此項棉花皆係花號昔日購進之貨、業已轉輾售予日廠、大為盈利也、華廠依然沉悶不辦、大概受法幣頭寸短絀影響、但同業之互相買賣、尚稱熱鬧、亦係現鈔棧交、惟木棉生意靜寂而無生氣、蘇北來源尚不中斷、碼頭上到細絨花二百四十九包、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>又另一報告、滬埠外棉交易、因金融調度困難、現貨一時不易脫手、故售價每担較定貨廉賤十餘元、而一時尚無人問津也、日來同業中與洋行方面結價者幾日有之、此却為操業者之高見也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、開盤印漲二磅音、後因利物浦及孟買來電而上騰，因出口津貼之故、引起大衆海外商之講買、銀行界在市購買亦頗猛烈、現貨交易轉旺、昨日農部秘書亨利戚爾斯發表訂定NewYork，Washington，Savannah，New　Orleans，Houston．五處為棉花輸出口岸、派有專員駐守、辦理出口登記事宜、昨日紐的漲十餘磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋軋空　國布鬆懈</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>織造成本雖增、但售盤受實銷與銀根束縛、難以跟漲、月內尚有廉價到期貨、必須晚售、同時廠方月底解款浩繁、亦願暫不加價售出一部份存貨、故售盤外弛內緊、怡和粗布每疋漲五分至一角細布·細斜開價平平、綫呢嗶嘰藍布士林布每疋提漲一角半至三角、夏貨素府綢本街尚有需胃、售價亦漲三五角、現銷以香港南洋帮獨佳、成交色布·色斜·紅標·漂布·細斜·粗布四千餘疋、本街進粗布·粗細斜·錢呢·嗶嘰一百餘件、北路烟台帮辦輕重磅粗布五六十件、申新廠開出富貴細布細斜一百餘件、內五十件係銷往昆明、</p>
<p>東疋</p>

<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭二十八日出口、一百五十件運香港、五十件運廣州灣、三件運北海、二十件運新加坡、五十件運寗波、</p>
<h3>糧食　各貨不出樣　米市停頓</h3>
<p>國米　市已呈停頓狀態、蓋除蕪湖砶尖開出七八百包、價為十六元、並變元臺車計一百二十五包、價二十二元外、其餘粳秈各貨、市上悉無出樣、照此情形、若無補救辦法、店舖存米、在此一週左右、將有告罄之虞、屆時滬埠食米、勢將發生恐慌是則有望當局、速謀良策、以補救之耳、全市來源、河下無到、車輸包子、亦僅一千三四百包而巳、</p>
<p>客秈　昨市仍以砶米為正宗交易、本街店舖零戶與內地帮均有續辦、統市成交砶糙與决機秈共計三千包、行情因限價嚴厲執行、仍與前市無大出入、惟據糧商消息、蕪米開禁一舉、尚有努力進行中、或能於下月一日公布實行、</p>
<p>洋米　昨日出入兩稀、統市祇開新西貢三四百包、行情則已站定原盤、仍開二十五元半、至於續定洋米一事、實為目下存米遂减中惟一要圖、聞米商芷在籌商云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤開出六千餘包</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電、略有上落、八月份小七五、為七先令〇七五、十二月份升二五、為六先令二辦士半、明年三月份不動、木市公會劃盤、二四粗白升三角、現貨本棧三十四元三角、外棧三十四元一角、轉口貨初為二十六元一角、後仍回至二十五元八角、荷赤現貨升三角、為二十八元二角、轉口貨由聯營處開出六千三百包、價升半元、以二十一元半成交、太古車白上檔升三四角、東梭B嘜三十七元二角半、西棧又三十七元半、OW嘜三十七元二角、CX嘜三十六元八角、下檔升六角、DY嘜三十六元四角、HX嘜三十六元二角、H嘜車赤仍為二十三元、木一號水升一元、為三十九元半、晶明冰四十一元、國糖續見緊秀、海南赤新到白包開出三四百包、二十一元至二十元八角、高貨看聚、石門片靑四十箱、開十七元八角、普通惠州白百條包、三十七元、東鄉赤六百餘包、開廿四元、次之廿三元二角、至二十二元八九角、又糖二百七十五包、昨由香港運來、又今日有一千六百四十包、運往寗波、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠絲保持　堅昂狀態　輯里絲開二千元</h3>
<p>本埠絲市、仍在堅穩上升中、昨日市情、較覺一新耳目者、為輯里經紐的城牌做開二〇〇〇元之行盤、其他六個號子已漲至一八〇〇元、均有日新月異之感、白廠經上海RR價三二〇〇元、鍚絲三一〇〇元、均保持高昂優勢、昨達昌仁昌等做開九十擔云、</p>
<p>國外市價、紐約現貨悉開原盤、近期本月份已停板、九月份二·五三元、較前日漲一分半、遠期漲一分、橫濱絲價現貨一三〇〇元、漲十元、遠期漲五元、然下午據橫濱長途電台消息、美國或已決定修正中立法之一部份、因之行將影饗美日貿易、是故橫濱絲價即告下回、計現貨跌三十元、遠期跌二十四元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　木耳桃肉　節節上升　蜜棗獻新</h3>
<p>木耳　近以來源復有阻碍、兼以貼水高昂、激漲甚烈、號貨續有開出一批、漲起三十餘元之多、以二百五十二元成盤、行盤因之遞增、但後市仍緊、有步升之象、</p>
<p>桃肉　冷氣天津桃肉、邇來以需耍甚殷、價格為之飛騰、津桃肉竟步漲至一百十元（鈔）、比上月杪差四十餘元、虎皮桃七十五元、亦升二十餘元、緊勢未衰、有直升之象、核桃漲度較差、手揀桃五十五元、東昌桃四十四元、南桃三十元至卅一元</p>
<p>蜜棗　蘇州蜜棗首批業已見新、計到五件、因值陳貨久斷、俏　異常、禿禿開至八十五元、聞嘉與貨不日亦可登塲、市勢甚緊、</p>
<h3>煤炭　河南缺貨　門莊改售海峰煤</h3>
<p>河南白煤自戰事後、因產地交通阻梗、迄無來貨、本市應銷端賴戰前存貨、籍資延喘、近來因底貨即將告磬、而銷塲反旺、供不敷求、漸感侷促、貨主又物稀居奇、同業交易統煤每噸巳喊七十五元、尚無大批棧單、故本街門莊店不得不改絃易轍、換賣洵峯白煤、但成本較責、每噸須七十七元云、</p>
<h3>進出口</h3>
<p>今（廿八日）有大量貨物運往香港、計豆子一千一百九十包，生仁二千四百七十包、生油一百三十件、鮮蛋二百五十件、另有豆子二千三百包、運新加坡、</p>

<h3>除津魯漢鈔票示外　各地法幣均通用　銀行錢莊並無拒用情事　商業銀行鈔票十足行使</h3>
<p>中國政府以全力維持法幣價值後、法幣準備、依然充足、現金終在百分之六十以上、深得全國人民以及友邦之信仰、對於津魯漢地名之鈔票、為防止投機取巧、並鼓勵資金流入內地計、規定收兌辦法兩則後、上海之兌換風潮平息、匯款入內地者激增、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、關於</p>
<p>外埠地名　之鈔票、除津·魯·（包括山東·濟南·青島·烟臺·威海衛等）漢·者外、上海市塲、一律十足通用、各銀行錢莊並無拒收情事、至於浙興、中實·四明·通商·農工·農商·墾業·中南等各商業銀行鈔票、除津魯漢地名與中國交通</p>
<p>同樣辦理　外、因各行發行準備、早由發行準備管理委員會接收、所以與法幣同樣行使、故凡持有各商業銀行之津魯漢地名以外之鈔票、可向指定之中中交三行兌換上海地名之鈔票、總而言之、除津魯漢地名外之鈔票、旣可</p>
<p>十足通用　持券人不應有所岐視、惟投機份子貶價收買津魯漢地名之鈔票、望持券人切勿受愚、又據金融界消息、日偽方面支持下之華興紙幣、以散發滬郊為多、但儘能於淪陷區內壓迫行使、永無流通孤島內之機會、居民旣反對使用、各銀行根本無承受</p>
<p>使用之意　加之各行今對庫房現底儲藏、已有堅强之準備、至希各界勿再輕信謠言誘惑、徒自驚擾、至於中中交三行上海分行、均願負起穩定市面金融重責、一切鎭定措施手段、悉聽命於重慶總行當局、今後反常傳說、早具擊破之決心、</p>
<h3>鎭海海門　屢遭轟炸　奉化日艦　砲轟桐焦</h3>

<h3>僞「市府」扣留垃圾車　目的在於要挾　欲與其他問題合併磋商　卡車十五輛猶未肯發還　羅斯述遭受惡遇經過</h3>
<p>大陸報云、工部局工務處羅斯等一行、星期一日強遭「大道」人員押往江灣、居汚穢之處四十六小時、食物短缺、並由武裝警察看守、經英總領署與工部局提出強有力的抗議後、諸人已於昨日（二十六日）釋回、惟價值至少五十萬元之工部局與私人卡車、仍在「上海特別市府」之「拘捕」下、其中工部局新購美國卡車十五輛之價值、的與「市長」傳筱庵向工部局要索在閘北傾倒垃圾權之欠款額相等、昨據工務處主任吉姆遜聲稱、</p>
<p>傅之機關特別難以應付、數週前聞法租界當局傾倒垃圾、遭遇困難、工部局乃與傳氏開始談判、然「大道」人員欲將此事與其他問題合併磋商、庶能使彼等滿意而解決此事、然彼等如此對付整個事件、毫無充分理由云、代理英總領事吉特遜昨日午前聲稱、諸人旣已於九時三十分釋出、渠不致</p>
<p>追究抗議云、據羅斯昨向記者陳述渠被扣江灣事云、星期一日午後的二時半、彼等一行百餘人在六三花園鄰近傾倒公共租界之垃圾、日飛機一架開始盤旋於上、方狐疑間、俄有「大道」警察的三十人及戎裝日人一名乘車到塲、出槍逼近、不容解釋、逼諸人返登卡車、謂須往江灣、時</p>
<p>車中垃圾多未傾盡車越鐵路綫而人租界馬路時、羅氏出汽車商諸日陸戰隊哨兵二名、並無結果、突有「大道」警察將渠推返卡車、至虹口公園前、見印捕一名、羅斯自車躍下、在印捕之小冊上留下便條、然後復登車上、卒抵市中心區、少頃、華工被禁一室、羅斯·德人白魯特·俄人與華籍監工各一、則被帶入發惡味而</p>

<p>諸人穿衣準備釋出、數分鐘後、該日人返室稱、因有游擊隊襲擊、故已宜布戒嚴令、須至晨間始能釋出云云、四時左右、諸人出室一吸新鮮空氣、七時許、「市府」人員開始到達、諸人復被禁室內終日、十一時半、羅斯設法發電話至工務處報告被扣詳情、並要求用警務汽車送</p>
<p>食物前往姚某聞訊、飭人送入麵包四隻、牛乳若干、羅斯告以寗待租界食物送到、姚某復遣人乘自由車儘速取返啤酒及菜餚若干、當警務處兩日籍人員送食物到達時、姚某請羅斯等弗予接受、然羅斯等充耳不聞、華工於被扣期間所食唯粗飯、至羅期每餐出洋六元、華工只得</p>
<p>蔬菜少許果腹、星期二日之夜、羅斯等四人、得新牀舖與整潔之被褥、始得成眠、昨晨、以租界送往食物之剩餘果腹、卡車停於室外、羅斯數决要求為衛生計、將車中發臭之垃圾傾去而未果、至午前十一時、羅斯等人得釋、乘</p>

<h3>說愁·恨·花·月亮之類</h3>
<p>— 熾強</p>
<p>攤開舊詩詞來看看，愁也有，恨也有。</p>
<p>這些老毛病，新詩總應該得救了，這也並不盡然。有愁有恨，無恨不成愁。</p>
<p>有人說詩人別有一副心腸，舊事恨它一恨，恨要恨得過癮，新愁還得添又添。</p>
<p>你曾經秤過這套愁恨有多少斤兩，照李清照說：『舊恨新愁，載不住雙溪蚱蜢舟！』</p>
<p>雙溪在我的家鄉，蚱蜢舟，大概總不外於那一類，但並不怎麼小，載重和吃水，都還可以；然而我們的騷人墨客之愁之恨，據說還載不住，這重量也就可想而知了！</p>
<p>病愁，病恨，在沒有找到適當的防疫針來注射之前，中國詩文壇上也就蔓延過一陣。不相信，你去哼，讓你去哼者，包你會墮入愁城，也會掉進恨海。你　　要登彼岸，要成名，非得把所有舊恨來填平恨海，『填海水兮將枮』，不是麼？把所有新愁擁進愁城，『一退愁城萬里降』，不是麼？</p>
<p>做詩填詞，本來都不難，所難的，便是愁得沒有章法，恨得沒有到火候。你的大作，好啦！不但空而無物，而且俗不可耐；內行一點說，便是有欠風雅。</p>
<p>然而，無風不成雅，有風呢，花開花落，花開，自然囉，『有美一人兮！』花落，當然落英　粉，咳！可惜！可惜！缺陷，缺陷！立刻發寒熱病。『月亮灣灣照九洲，幾家歡樂幾家愁』；於是望月亮生氣，從『月上柳梢頭』一直生氣到月落烏啼，這呌做：『古來將月作愁的，推月下來愁始休。』</p>
<p>月亮，上古有，中古近世也都有，將來還要明明亮；而花，年年今日開，來日謝；愁不完，恨裏還有恨，重重疊疊，新的舊的，這樣佔去文藝一大頁。</p>
<p>的嗎呢呀，不足病；新詩溫舊恨，月移花影斑剝在我們祖先的牆角，今夕分外明，啊呀！這才沒有辦法，你還在學愁添恨，撈月攀花？</p>
<p>也只好沒有話了。抄一首辛稼軒的詞來攻毒，並且用來煞梢：</p>
<p>少年不識愁悶滋味，愛上層樓，愛上層樓，為賦新詞彊說愁。而今識盡愁滋味，欲說還休，欲說還休，卻道天涼好箇秋。</p>
<p>好箇『天涼好箇秋』！</p>
<p>中原擾讓，正值國家多事之秋。</p>
<h3>真理的書（下）</h3>
<p>— 馬拉</p>
<p>「於是大家齊奔到那個山上，打開了真理的書，用着宏亮的調子誦讀着書中的句語，他們的聲音朗朗地傳到世界的每個角落，告訴人們沒有那批壓迫者也是一樣可以生活的，並且一定更加幸福，更加自由。這樣全世界都被騷動與不安籠罩着了，恐怖威脅着各國，當然壓迫最盛的國家懼怕也就更厲害，為了企圖和最後的命運掙扎：他們煽動起一個為人民踢在一邊的潦倒的軍官，來代他們作更大的屠殺。」</p>
<p>「這一次屠殺真是空前的，甚至人民在宗教裁判所和里維拉時代也沒有受到過。他們想把人民的英勇的　爭消滅在大屠殺裏，他們猶如一羣瘋狂的魔術師，只要是這羣魔術師經過的地方，熱鬧的都市就成了廢墟。毀滅，死亡，和平的人民底無辜的血流遍了這個國度的土地，屍首山一樣地堆積在山凹中大路旁村荘裏，朗朗的聲音微弱了，終於窒息在他們自己的血泊裏，一切全是強權勝利了」。父親悲憤地一口氣說着，像從一個長長的夢裏醒過來。他想吸一口烟，可是烟斗已經熄滅了，他決絕地再加上一句：「我底故事就這樣完了」。</p>
<p>「不應該這樣就算完了」。我抑制了悲痛的感情大聲說，我的心被它絞得很痛楚了。</p>
<p>「對，好孩子，暴力取得的勝利只是一種假象，我肯定地告訴你，第三次的悲劇還是在準備中，我們要相信着將來」。父親又鎮靜又堅定的說。</p>
<p>我希望恢復我平靜的心境，我就把頭旋開去，想要忘掉那個悲痛的結尾帶着很深的絕望的故事，在遠方的天幕上，我忽然發見了貼着稀疏的金鈕扣一般的幾顆星星，閃閃地亮着。月亮也從雲障裏探出臉來，把清澄的月光流注進樹林，一二片彩霞在旁邊緩緩地浮動。</p>
<p>「父親，那邊有了星星」。我驚喜地指着牠們呌起來。</p>
<p>「是的，我看見牠們，總覺得光明真是無處不在，就是我的故事也還是暗示着很大的希望，還是輝耀未來的光明與暖熱的」。父親忘了自己地說着，攪着他的豐富的如有彈力的頭髪。</p>
<p>「涼了，我們去睡吧」。父親底激動已經退盡了。</p>
<p>晚上我做了一個夢，在夢裏展開了那個國度的人民爭自由謀幸福的奮　之大悲劇的全景。</p>
<p>謹以此文獻給　甘先生，這個最懂得西班牙的人，他在我疑惑和墮落的日子裏溫暖了我底心，使我有新的精力，能夠繼續生活下去，我在這裏遙祝他的健康。</p>
<h3>大地的歎息</h3>
<p>— 文庫</p>
<p>是過去的時代了，大地還在欣然地生長，那時，牠是樸實的，然而，牠有着原始的美。</p>
<p>在牠的幼年，那掀伏的山嶺，曲折的江河，無邊際的大海，廣漠的平原，以及青葱的樹木，繽紛的花朵，龐大的走獸，靈巧的飛禽，鳴蟲……將牠很純潔地點綴着。</p>
<p>那時，牠帶着處女的柔美，像一枝含苞的花蕾，在整個宇宙間，牠更染着無限的生氣。</p>
<p>大地在安靜的日子內悄悄地生長着，沒有寂寞，一切的生物，在老朽得結束生命的時候，立刻有新的美的來代替，從不陷零落，更沒有絲毫的缺　。</p>
<p>漸漸地，大地進化了，聰敏的人類在繁殖着，這使牠更興奮了，牠將全個生命交付給人類了，他們將絞盡豐富的腦汁，竭盡健壯的　力，掘發地下的寶藏，開拓荒蕪的土地，將大地修飾得華麗，綺美。</p>
<p>可是這些人類的魂靈，有着很大的參差，忠實的，誠懇的……狡猾的，　詐的……於是，糾紛，　爭……代替了他們的事業，不再努力工作，使大地變得秀麗，將大地造成一個幸福的世界！</p>
<p>他們忘了，惟有大地，能使牠們生存，他們不知補救，烈火的灰燼，殘殺的血跡，殺人的利器，拙劣的詭計……沾汚了大地；大地上，從此失去了天真，失去了純潔的美，而那些猙獰的惡魔，卑鄙的鬼怪，又將可愛的大地作為牠們的巢穴。</p>
<p>暴戾者的殺戮，威武者的恫嚇，鬼怪的長嘯，被欺陵者的哀泣，將大地的美景，全都毀去！</p>
<p>大地上，零落，嘈亂，一陣陣暴風，一陣陣狂　！</p>
<p>人類走上了毀滅之途，同時，他們將美好的大地，也消滅了！</p>
<p>大地不能哭泣，也不能憤怒，祗在幽幽地歎息，牠是為了人類而嘆息啊！同時，也因了自己的命運！</p>
<p>牠等待人類的醒悟，希望驅走了帶着人形的假面具的鬼怪，使牠能重放出年青時代的光輝。</p>
<p>但是，在牠的目前，卻仍是一付愁慘的景象。</p>
<p>不停，不停，大地在嘆息着。</p>
<h3>纒績不已！</h3>
<h3>我凝望着遠天底雲和樹</h3>
<p>— 郭尼迪</p>
<p>從三十里外的一個城市里回來，</p>
<p>那裏曾度過我悠長的月月年年：</p>
<p>黃昏底大街上裝璜美麗的　窗邊，</p>
<p>常駐着我孤單寂寞的影子。</p>
<p>現在連朝有惱人的風和雨，</p>
<p>聽戶外的風響掠過的樹尖如海濤：</p>
<p>讓雨聲來輕敲我緊閉的門扉吧，</p>
<p>初到故居，一切都感到陌生的情趣，</p>
<p>我本來索然猶如野僧。</p>
<p>單調的鳴蟲們底　樂已引不起　悅，</p>
<p>兒時底侶伴在風塵中也逐漸老了。</p>
<p>而這里底星辰何況又都變了顏色：</p>
<p>我不敢上市集去，</p>
<p>因為我憎見市集上的一切怪樣。</p>
<p>雖則我是不安於岑寂的，然而我怕</p>
<p>病菌會慢慢地在我底血球里滋長！</p>
<p>我正需要呼吸些原野底潤濕的氣息，</p>
<p>嘈雜的車馬底喧囂實不勝其煩了。</p>
<p>唔，此刻我祗希望明朝是個晴，</p>
<p>一早醒來就是聽那鵓　底啼聲，</p>
<p>雨後在嫩黃的小徑上消磨些時辰。</p>
<p>不是嗎，『人在太陽光底下病菌較易衰老？』</p>
<p>那時我將凝望着遠天底雲和樹，</p>
<p>而我底心卻要飛向那更遠處。</p>
<h3>簷溜</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>生死</p>
<p>一天，走進了墓園，朋友說：「我想死。」他眼睛釘着白色的十字架，也許是那女神吧？過去，朋友活在一個不大如意的環境裏，讀着那些帶有死亡的芬香的書籍--牠們教給年青人以一些古怪的念頭。</p>
<p>聽了這話，我　異地說：「靜靜地躺在這兒，你不嫌寂寞嗎？」</p>
<p>「你瞧，不是有這麼多的伴侶。」他指着地下的墳墓，睜大了那對圓圓的眼睛說。</p>
<p>「但，這是可恥的逃　呢！」</p>
<p>他不語，低垂下頭。</p>
<p>不錯，「人生是那担子，有的挑了起來，有的挑不起來。」如今，我們又行走在一條痛苦的道路上，有點兒疲倦也許是真的，但還不至倒下。打起精神，換一個肩頭，咱們仍得走下去，仍得活下去。</p>
<p>「死並不難，然而，我們得考慮怎樣死法。對於生命總該有熱愛和執着。」</p>

<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>過去和現在（上）</h3>
<p>— 王引</p>
<p>編者介紹：王引向來是以「硬派」的作風見稱於電影界的，他為中國電影事業努力，已有了近十年的體騐，最近他以演員而開始嘗試導演，正在攝製「亡命之徒」一片。從這一篇文字中，可以知道他是一個有思想的藝人。</p>
<p>踏進電影圈以來，屈指已有近十年的光景，在這悠長的歲月中，很慚愧的，我是沒有把握住這許許多多人渴望着的機會，來發展我的抱負；雖然我也時常扮着重要以及適合我個性的角色，但是始終沒有較好的成績貢獻給觀衆，這是我最認為遺憾的一件事。</p>
<p>我加入電影界最初動機，一半雖然是為了興趣，一半也可以說是為了生活的關係，這是不必諱言的：在那時候—中國電影事業勃興的初期，有許多人都認為「拍影戲」是一個新穎而良好的職業，我的家庭，自父親失業以後就日趨艱困，所以我得到了投入這銀色之門的機會，我的一顆心是異常地活躍着，我懷着無限的興奮，刻苦耐勞地努力着。同時外界對於電影事業的熱望，使我在心靈上也刻畫了一道堅強的信念：我準備用我的全力去創造。</p>
<p>我開始攝影塲生活的發祥地是曁南影片公司，記得第一部戲是和「已故」的葉娟娟小姐配戲，僅僅是配戲，我在片中担任着一個不甚重要的角色，所謂「跑龍套」之類，在演出方面處處顯示我的生硬呆板，幸而曁南的幾位同事們都能盡心指鑼我，隨時予我以鼓勵，這樣我纔勉強把我所担任的戲拍完，直到片子試映，我又黃喜悅又是惶恐，但這樣畢竟奠定了我近十年來的影人生活。</p>
<p>在曁南公司混了兩年，不過演了兩三部戲，後來得名攝影師洪偉烈先生的介紹，進了上海影戲公司，當時因為上海公司演員的缺乏，我竟幸運地被但杜宇先生選為中角，接連演了「東方夜譚」「失足恨」「美人島」幾部戲，那時候我的「藝名」是「王春元」。</p>
<p>在上海公司所主演的幾部戲，大都是屬於武俠激鬥一類的片子，當時電影的作風頗趨向於這一方面，所以這一類作品很受覜衆的歡迎，在那一時期是絕對談不到什麼「意識」的，於是我也盲從着，相當起勁地在攝影塲上幹着鬥爭的工作。</p>
<h3>大大王，二大王　荒郊爭雄記（四）</h3>
<p>— 斐叔</p>
<p>—梅邊雜憶之五—</p>
<p>這一個故事已寫完了，本可就此結束。但是我却因此小有感觸，不知編者先生能吾許我畢其辭吾？（古文作法，每於記事之後，略加評論，以作收束。如魏冰叔文集中的魏叔子日，我也不妨抄襲前賢，來一個李叔子曰：）</p>
<p>朱許兩人之爭，本是一種無意識的洩憤主義，原無足置論。但是他倆不呌別人知道，到頗有埋頭苦幹的精神。常其被後台同人發現，找到黑潭龍來的時候，相對嘆息，表示失望！因為沒有能貫澈他倆初衷，一判雌雄，這確是大地間一大恨事！由第三者出來講和，這也是常情，並沒有用壓力使之就範。同時兩人也並未喪失顫面，而且可以免去兩敗俱傷之害，雖然後來分出了大大王二大王之稱，但是這是過去的事實問題，似無足介意，今後台同人之稱朱湘泉，都呌他為二代王而不名，朱並不以為辱也。如果第三者要一方向對方賠個不是，甚至要他拿出醫藥費來給對方，那們這便是屈辱的和平了！我想他兩人一定不肯接受，一定還是去幹！所以我覺得和之道太多了，有「榮和」，有「辱和」，有「不榮不辱之和」，「榮和」者戰勝之和也，「辱和」者戰敗之和也；「不榮不辱之和」者，如朱許之和是也。人之心理，當然要以「得榮和」為上策，昔先師南通張季直先生有言：「自來中外交鬨，不過戰和二策，和取目前之無事，戰為全局之通籌。以和為和，是罷戰之論出於我，則我弱彼强；以戰為和，使願和之請出於彼，則彼絀我伸。」旨哉斯言！眞是千古不易之理也。寫荒郊爭雄記畢，忽有所感，略贅數語於文尾，自覺太囉囌了！讀者勿怪！（完）</p>
<h3>范雪朋將重入綠寳</h3>
<p>— 玉笛</p>
<p>綠寳劇塲的台柱女角，以前是范雪朋，她山銀幕而踏上話劇舞台，自然深受觀衆的歡迎。不幸范以體質孱弱，日夜登台，不勝繁劇，後經醫生診斷，說她患有肺病，於是嚇得她再三向綠寶請辭。范雪朋脫離之後，綠寶「度請朱秋痕抵缺，但朱秋痕應付不下，號召力也不够，這纔改邀現在的王雪艷承乏。</p>
<p>范雪朋經數月來的憇養，不久以前，到海格路紅十字會醫院裹去，用愛克斯光檢查了一决肺部，結果騐得肺葉無損，這樣證明了范雪朋患的並不是肺病了！綠寶當局開此消息，於是又專人登門邀請，仍要求范雪朋重回綠寶；聞巳有允意，如果條件談妥，也許八月一日起，將在綠實登台。</p>
<h3>故都各科班動態</h3>
<p>— 燕雁</p>
<p>故都科班為數雖多，然除富連成，戲曲學校，榮春社以外，其他均無足輕重。茲述其三班之最近動態如下，以為關心者告。</p>
<p>（一）富連成社　富社以葉盛章為中心，月之四日在吉祥戲園演歐陽德一劇而中暑，以致多日未曾出演，劇目均由黃元慶等代演。後起武行諸生，角色整齊，藝術極有進步，頃聞該社社長葉文甫氏談稱，將與武行教授王連平商酌，排演全部「三俠五義」，該劇乃該社舊藏小榮椿科班傳本，自白玉堂尋御貓五義餞行，至獨龍橋水擒白玉堂止，源源本本，與衆不同。一俟全體人選派定，即着手開排，在華樂戲院首演。</p>
<p>（二）戲曲學校　最近該校當局發表上年度學生成績，靑衣第一名侯玉蘭，老生第一名李和會，武生王金璐，老旦李金泉，武凈袁金綿，總成績候玉蘭獨占鱉頭，王金璐屈居亞軍。又本年秋季為該校成立十五週年紀念，亦為王金璐李和曾王和霖等出科之日，故議定是日擴大舉行一成立紀念及畢業生大典禮。</p>
<p>（三）榮春社　榮春社着重排演本戲及舊有老戲，先後演出者甚夥。新近有五人義一劇，即可演出。尚小雲以琵琶仙子投與孫榮蕙，蔡榮貴以全部捉放授與徐榮奎，此外有全部刺巴杰，由尚長春飾駱宏勛，孫瑞春飾胡理，田榮芬飾巴九奶奶。此三齣好戲均排演純熟，行將陸續演出，以饗故都人士之限福。</p>
<h3>藝華雜訊</h3>
<p>貂斑華姿態美妙　二月前藝華宜傳傾全力撮製古裝片「王寶釧」，當時代戰公主一角，發生汪洋·古寒爭奪戰，藝華應付為難，爰改以貂斑華，據是片導演吳村語人，貂飾代戰公主，極見佳妙，蓋貂之面部輪廓，十分配合此角服裝，且頗見英氣勃勃也。</p>
<p>寗萱大有噱頭　寗萱小姐，玩票而拍電影，復又電影而跳舞，旋而跳舞而玩票，再從票界而重返銀壇，幾年來，循環變換，可見這位小姐好動極矣，寗小姐本為南方產，然自小寄居北平，故說得一口非常動聽的國語，此番陳鏗然導演「女子公寓」，三位一體去請了她擔任十分吃重的一個「王惹芳」角色「女子公寓」開拍就是她的戲，寗小姐幾年體騐，果然演技突飛猛晋，都說「寗萱眞有希望」。</p>
<p>藍蘭顯身銀幕　看過舞台劇「女子公寓」，對於飾陳佩佩的那位藍蘭小姐，非常滿意，道位標準陳佩佩終於在銀幕上出現，藍蘭小姐為着鏡頭美覜起見，更不惜皮肉之痛，眼皮割了一刀，變了雙眼皮，就格外嫵媚動人，將來「女子公寓」影片公映，預料不少影迷，將爲銀幕上陳佩佩傾倒矣。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>大軸戲前休息十分鐘的意義</p>
<p>向來梨園的舊規，例不得中途「剪鑼」，「剪　」與「開鑼」是相對而言的。中劇的塲面雖是以鼓為主腦，儼如三軍之司命，但是戲班的規矩向來總是在開戲的時候，說開鑼而不說開鼓的。又如某角係演開　第一齣，或開鑼前三齣，這全是向來說慣了的。至於每日戲完的時候，從前都說某園子已經剪鑼啦，現在全都改稱曰「打住」啦，按理說大鑼小鑼二者全為扶助動作的緊要樂器，在演武戲的當兄，兩軍對壘，刀槍並舉，此際固籍大鑼之響聲振奮演員與觀衆們的精神，即文戲中生，旦，丑，各角上塲時的步伐，身段，以及小生文縐縐的姿態神情，亦非借重小鑼之嘚嘚嘚的響聲不足以使人心曠神怡。所以從前各園支配戲碼時無不異常慎重，大凡一齣震耳欲聾的武劇之後，一定緊跟着一齣滑稽小戲，價天饗的鑼鼓聲剛一停止，馬上嘚嘚嘚的小鑼聲即繼之而起，如同疾風暴雨之後，忽然現出些微陽光，露出淡藍色的犬空來，凉風習習實在覺得　快非常，悶在心裹好久的一口濁氣此時也可以全行吐出了。大鑼與小鑼二者，其轉移舞台上動作及看客視綫之力量旣如此之偉大，故「開鑼」一名詞，其最初擬議時亦自有其相常之理由。再如塲面中人所熟讀之「鑼鼓經」及內行人常云某劇某處當起何種鑼鼓，此「起鑼鼓」三字亦係以鑼字居首，是殆又為開塲戲應稱開鑼戲的明證。（六八）</p>

<h3>日出之前</h3>
<p>— 魯思</p>
<p>導演大戲，這次是第二回。第一次是慘敗了，我眞担憂着這决的不克勝任，重蹈過去的覆轍。</p>
<p>兩星期前的一個淸晨，保聯劇團的負責人談君由金鑫先生的紹介，冒着風雨上我這兒來，要我去給他們趕排沈宥先生底「日出之前」。</p>
<p>當時，我的腦海中立刻浮映起了契訶夫底「海鷗」的命運來：初决在彼得堡上演的空前慘敗，與莫斯科藝術學院演出的絕後成功，同一的劇本，而前後兩次的演出成績竟有偌大的懸殊，由此可見導演對於劇本的理解是怎樣的重大，他的藝術與政治的修養程度，是可以左右戲劇的生死，影響着戲曲的演出之成敗的。</p>
<p>因此，我是婉言謝絕了。我懷疑自己的藝術修養，我更不信任自己對於劇本的理解，我懼怕自己無形的做了劊子手，殺害沈宥先生的劇本之生命。</p>
<p>可是，他們不允許我推辭，他們說這决是「慈善公演」，導演一職，理應義不容辭的。</p>
<p>在「導演義賣」的前提下，我是無言地默應了。但是，我的心頭却又鉛樣地沉重起來，我想着：要在短短的十二天之內，趕排出一個四幕的大戲，總覺得是有損藝術的尊嚴的；然而，這也是沒奈何的事，因為慈善公演不能因保聯的「日出之前」一戲而改期。於是，在道整整十幾天的排戲時期內，我是感到萬分的苦痛，內心強烈地起着「藝術」與「救難」的衝突的苦悶。</p>
<p>現在好了，心境巳恢復了平靜。感謝演員們的聰明與努力，總算給我取下了久壓在心頭的一塊大石，我可以舒舒服服的透口氣了。</p>
<p>「日出之前」，這是沈宥先生於二年前「有感」而寫的。可是，時至今日，已經「事過境遷」，正如沈宥先生自己所說：『這戲的寫作時間環境與現在逈不相同』了，因此，要拿這戲搬上今日的舞台，不能不把沈宥先生所暴露及諷刺的對象大大的轉移一下。</p>
<p>我應該感謝沈宥先生允許我儘量改動他的傑作；同時，我又該對於沈宥先生表示萬分的歉忱，因為我眞的將他的傑作，大胆地加以若干地方的改動了。</p>
<p>我以為在黃惟仁這樣的大家庭的封建環境中，必然會發生劇作者沈宥先生所預言的悲劇，而製造道種悲劇的主要因素，不消說是舊有的這種不合理的社會關係；並且，這裹的一切糾粉與鬥爭，也是毫無異議的，完全是那陳腐的大家庭制度所產生的。</p>
<p>故，我對於「日出之前」的主題，給予不同的解釋。我把「日出之前」僅僅看作一幅大家庭制度崩潰的眞實圖畫。</p>
<p>基於這個觀點，我是使大少奶奶與三弟黃維廉這兩個陣壘更加對立起來，加強他們之間的鬥爭，這是新與舊的鬥爭</p>
<p>因此，我導演這戲，不把「日出之前」看作悲劇，認為它是一個悲喜劇。——我特別強調這戲的結束，雖然台上死着三個人，我不許觀衆帶着悲哀回來，我要他們淚中含笑，懷着一種新的希望回去，我更要他們感受了一種新的力量回去！</p>
<p>話雖這麼銳，但是，演出的效果究竟如何，我却不敢說。我希望朋友們能够多多地給我些嚴正的批評。</p>
<h3>淪陷區畢業學生的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 淪陷區學生謹上</p>
<p>編輯先生大鑒：</p>
<p>我是向在北年求學的，今年夏天中學畢業後，便到上海來，原抱着滿腔的熱誠，想考國立大學，萬一能够錄取的話，我可以把以往在淪陷區所感受的痛苦，都從此暫時勾消，豈不是很樂意的事。所以天天注意着聯合考試報名招生的廣告。前天看見聯合考試定期了，當然加緊準備，但是，我做夢也想不到的，報名處的辦事人員看了我的文憑後說：「這文憑上寫的是北京不能應考，萬一破例通融，顯有承認偽政府之嫌，所以教育局對於這一類畢業證書是不予承認的，除非再補得一張有效的文憑。」這好比靑天裹起了個霹靂，滿腔熱誠被潑了　一勺冷水。叉說：「這問題且待當局開了會再決定。」這句話無非是慰籍之詞，不使我絕望罷了。因此我憫人覺得這不准應考的問題，實有二點有提出討論的必要：</p>
<p>（一）淪陷區—北平—辦育教的為了適應環境起見，不得不把北平改作北京，這原是迫不得已的事。決非辦教育的所甘心。要是堅持不改，學校勢必關門。經濟寬裕的學生，果然儘可以設法出境求學，自無問題。那末另一批家境淸寒的學生，將如何解決？這一點當時教育當局，似未注意，所以並無訂定適當的補救辦法。因此我們學生，依舊繼續完成我們中學的學業，誰想到有今天不准應考得苦衷。</p>
<p>（二）淪陷區的學生，因為受不了種種凌辱，很願意跑到內地去求學。但是現在竟不予收留，在此情况之下，勢必呌我們回到虎口裹去度此殘生，這種辦法，也許是大家所不願意的。</p>
<p>所以從以上兩點看來，教育當局最好能使我們在不多耗金錢和時間的原則下，定一個適當的議決案，免得我們這批淪陷區的學生，再回去過含了淚的生活！</p>
<p>像我那樣遭受苦悶的人，一定很多，所以不揣冒昧，函請貴欄賜予刊出，以期教育當局的注意，不勝感禱。</p>
<h3>陳心如先生法書</h3>
<h3>女彈詞人物誌</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>至佩蘭之晚年，則「海上羣芳譜」卷二，會有載紀，稱其：「庚辰（一八八〇）夏，為邑侯某之公子所賞，一曲求鳳，遂成連理。未幾，公子以消渴卒。錦被空熏，鴛　獨守，聞妓已勸絕塵緣，將以牟尼百八，終老其身。」是佩蘭後來之命運，亦殊可悲。此當時女彈詞之以慈善見稱者。論才，則有程黛香。「夢影錄」卷一：</p>
<p>滬上彈詞女有程黛香者，頗以能詩名，而性尤痴絕，嘗自負欲兼黛玉香君而有之，故以為名。香閣中懸馮小靑題曲團，霧餐風髪，姿容逼肖，黛香每於花晨月夕，喃喃對語，別有會心。嘗題三絕句云：「焚將詩草了今生，莫再他生尚有情。卿說憐卿惟有影，儂將卿盡可憐卿。」「鄉題艷曲我題詩，舊事錢塘有所思。後有小靑前小小，一般才女兩情痴。」「美人命薄本多愁，濃福還須幾世修。一事慰卿兼自慰，留將詩草也千秋。」其自命不凡，亦可想見。迄今黛香沒已十餘年，詩稿亦若存若亡。不可多得。錄其一二，亦迷香洞中吉光片羽也。</p>
<p>此外之足，尚有袁雅琴。「冶遊錄卷三云：阿卡袁雅琴，嘉禾人，…官裔也。…慶辛之際，姬年甫六齡，散失無歸，為乳媼所鬻，遂隸樂籍，籍彈詞以博纏頭，寰固其偽姓也。泊然靜坐，不輕言笑……」然其事仍具有悲劇性。其本身遭際，有類舊小說中之傳奇喜劇，則無有過於棄孔芝者。「瀛衰瑣記」載吳門紅豆館主八「葉孔芝小傳」，述其人其事，最為詳備。（一三）</p>
<h3>胭脂虎</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Person　In　Hiding”</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司出品南京大戲院映</p>
<p>這位派拉蒙的新人！潘麗莤摩莉蓀，在「胭脂虎」就有了驚人的成績。冷靜的面部，尖銳的目光，是她演飾反派角色最好的條件，而在戀愛塲面上，一般孕蓄着的熱情之火的流露，是和桃樂珊拉摩有相似之處，我們且留意着她的下一部作品，我預測她會走後面一條路的。</p>
<p>這劇本是一位破案櫐纍的G-Men寫的，以一個身歷其境的人來寫這樣的劇本，，自然有獨到之處。如化裝兜捕的那塲戲中，眞是寫得細膩週到之至。不過他把朶洛齊的美慕虛榮，還不够有力，這樣的女性確有墜落的可能，但是她馬上能够運籌帷幄，以「胭脂虎」的恣態出現，犯案櫐纍，終究免強一點。如果劇作者把兜捕以後的戲拉掉（在這高潮上終塲也是很自然的），而在前面強調朶洛齊的一步一步墜落下去，於是才造成了「胭脂虎」的地位，這樣，這個戲的成就，或許，還在現在之上。</p>
<p>導演者儘量避免搶劫塲面，而着力在朶洛齊的生活方面，這是和共他一切GMen作品避免雷同，而感到可愛的地方，譬如朶洛齊和馬丁搶刼之後，逃到她父母所居的農舍去，他寫明父女的兩年不見，母女之間的天倫之愛，但是母親發現自己的女兒是個可怕的人物的時候，她把她趕去了，並且不許父親接受他們的贈金，這塲戲的情感是很濃厚的。兜捕的高潮，更能把一步緊迫一步的緊張氣氛緊緊抓住，自然，一半也得歸功於劇本。</p>
<p>兜捕以後的戲，不免鬆懈下來，然而朶洛齊不忍老母的被執，決心道出馬丁藏匿之地為條件，預備自己遁走，是更給於潘麗茜摩莉蓀和卡洛爾納許（馬丁）多一個演戲的機會。如在兩人分別，及電話通知警署的時候，這兩位演員都能發揮他們的演技。</p>

        <h1>1939.07.28</h1>
<h3>Important Diplomatic Move by the United States: US-Japan Commercial Treaty Declared Void - Sanctions Loom, Japan Shocked, Stocks Plummet - China Believes It is the Greatest Moral Support</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States government has decided to declare the annulment of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This startling news was released yesterday around 10 PM, when the head of the State Department's information office summoned reporters from various newspapers, providing them with a statement. It stated that the US government, in order to more comprehensively protect the interests it maintains in the Far East and to foster their development, has decided to declare the annulment of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. According to the provisions of this treaty, the US government's decision will take effect six months after notification, i.e., January 26, 1940. Consequently, the proposal by Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to prohibit the shipment of munitions and raw materials to Japan, can be submitted for discussion once Congress reconvenes in January next year, as the treaty's provisions stipulate that neither side may discriminate against the other, which would conflict with Pittman's proposal. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the US government's notification of the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Ambassador Horinouchi's telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arrived at 3 PM on the 27th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will carefully study the true intentions of the US government based on this report and then seek appropriate and effective measures at a suitable time. (Domei, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Based on instructions from his government, the US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Dooman, visited Yoshizawa, the director of the American Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at noon today, formally notifying him of the US decision to abrogate the current US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and explaining the reasons. It was stated that due to the recent surge in American imports of Japanese cotton yarn products, the US, after considering various defensive measures, accepted the demands of the private sector and took this action. Director Yoshizawa, while acknowledging the notification, stated that the sudden move by the US had to be considered an act of challenge towards Japan. He also stated that even if the US proposed the conclusion of a new treaty in the future, satisfactory results would not be obtained if such an attitude was not abandoned, urging the US to reconsider. (Domei, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The first reaction here upon hearing the US announcement of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was shock. Japan initially believed that the bill proposed by Republican Senator Vandenberg in the Senate on July 18th was purely a domestic political maneuver and would not be implemented. Japan had long thought that America was exercising patience, thus misunderstanding its attitude towards Japan. Now, the sudden move by the US government has shattered the long-propagated misunderstanding of America's attitude. After receiving this news, the Japanese stock market plummeted, with some stocks falling by two yen. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, there is great joy here regarding the US decision to abrogate the trade treaty with Japan. Although this decision will take effect in six months, the general consensus is that it is perhaps the greatest moral encouragement that any power could give to China. Prior to the announcement of this matter, Chongqing had received intelligence that the US would make some kind of move to break away from Britain's appeasement policy in the Far East. Observers believe that this action by the US is a very clever move psychologically, which will make a most profound impression on the Chinese regarding American friendship. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Regarding the declaration of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Secretary of State Hull delivered a note to Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday, stating: "For several years, the United States government has studied the treaties of commerce and navigation signed between our country and various nations, thereby seeking to revise them so that the original objectives of these treaties may be more easily achieved. Soon a conclusion was reached that certain clauses in the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation established between the United States and Japan in Washington on February 21, 1911, need to be reconsidered. Now, for the necessity of preparing in advance and adapting to the progress of the situation, so that American interests may be more comprehensively protected and developed, in accordance with Article 17 of this treaty, we hereby notify your government of the intention to declare its abrogation. From now on, this treaty and the attached protocol shall expire six months after July 26 of this year." (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3>New Sino-British Loan Still Under Negotiation - Premature to Speak of Signing</h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored in Chinese circles that Britain has granted China a new export credit loan of £3 million, which was signed last week. This report is denied here today, with sources stating that these negotiations have been ongoing for months, but have not yet been concluded, and there is no signing. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Commemorative Stamps Presented to US President</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao presented 30 sets of Chinese stamps to the American Embassy here to be forwarded to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Postmaster General Farley. These stamps are commemorative stamps issued by the Chinese government to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the US government. The stamps come in four denominations: 3 fen, 5 fen, 2 jiao 5 fen, 5 jiao, and 1 yuan. The center features a map of China adorned with miniature American flags. Ten million sets of these stamps have been issued and are being sold throughout China. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Most Startling Development Since the Sino-Japanese War Began: Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty May Also Be Abrogated</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, in order to take consistent action with the United States in the Far East, Britain intends to terminate the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty today. It is said that when the British government abrogates this treaty, it will give Japan a one-year grace period. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The US notification to Japan to cancel the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is arguably the most startling event related to the Sino-Japanese War, as it follows closely after President Roosevelt's defeat in the Senate regarding the Neutrality Act revision, signaling a resurgence of the American isolationist faction. Although the newspapers have not yet published articles criticizing it, the evening papers have prominently featured this news. Political circles are currently refusing to comment, stating that they have not yet received official notification of the treaty's cancellation and that its effects should be carefully considered. Reuters has gathered opinions from Chinese, British, and Japanese sources as follows: The Chinese are overjoyed, saying that they expected the US to take action sooner or later from the beginning of the war, and now it has come true. The British believe that the US action will have a beneficial impact on the Tokyo talks. Japanese businessmen are concerned that the notification of cancellation has almost the same effect as the actual cancellation because American businesses will hesitate to enter into contracts with Japanese businesses, as they do not know what their position will be in January next year. Some observers now fear that extremists in the Japanese military may use this opportunity to force Japan to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. Others are more optimistic, saying that Japan relies on the US for supplies of scrap iron and gasoline, both of which are necessary for warfare, so they believe that the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty may well open the door to eventual peace. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Members of Parliament here are delighted to hear that the US government has declared the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, saying: "The poor impression created by the US government's refusal to cooperate with Britain and France in financially assisting China to stabilize its currency has now been completely dispelled. Moreover, the US move has special significance, as the existing Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty was also established in 1911. The British government may follow in the footsteps of the United States when necessary and declare its abrogation." Regarding this matter, the government has not yet considered it, but political figures insist that the British authorities will not allow the Tokyo talks to extend beyond the scope of the Tianjin local incident. In addition, the main source of Japanese military supplies is about to be cut off (referring to the Pittman proposal, which the US Congress will discuss in January next year), which should easily pressure Japan to comply.

<h3>British Compromise with Japan: MPs Raise Questions One After Another, Undersecretary of State Declares No More Munitions Shipped to Japan</h3>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons session this afternoon, several MPs raised questions about financial assistance to China. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler reiterated in his reply that Britain's policy towards China had not changed. Labour MP Maclean asked whether the Japanese war aims in China were recognized by the British government and whether future Anglo-Japanese talks would be based on the principle of China's vast territory falling into the hands of the Japanese army and being governed by Japan. Butler replied: "No." Maclean further asked: "Since the land involved in the Anglo-Japanese talks does not belong to Britain or Japan, what is the reason for conducting the talks?" Butler replied: "Certain facts, even if extremely displeasing to the British government, must sometimes be taken into consideration." Labour MP Henderson asked whether, after the conclusion of the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement, Britain would no longer legally recognize the Chinese government and continue to provide it with financial assistance. Butler replied that the Anglo-Japanese agreement did not mean a change in Britain's general policy towards China, as Prime Minister Chamberlain had already stated. Henderson also said that a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry had made a statement saying that Britain would no longer provide financial assistance to China, and the government should pay attention to this. Butler then reiterated his assurance that Britain's policy towards China had not changed. Labour MP Alexander asked whether representations had been made to the Japanese government regarding the Japanese blockade policy, which had now extended to Shameen. Undersecretary of State Butler replied: "The entire matter is under consideration." Labour MP Maclean also raised a question about the four Chinese suspects in the Tianjin Cheng Xigeng case, saying, "Does the right to try these suspects belong to the Chinese courts, rather than being taken over by the British and Japanese?" Butler did not answer this point, merely stating that the suspects would not be extradited until the Japanese side presented new evidence. Labour MP Price asked whether any countries had taken the necessary measures to prevent the sale of armaments to Japan. Butler replied that, apart from the US government's advice to aircraft manufacturers not to sell aircraft to Japan, no other countries had made any public statements. As far as Britain is concerned, the government has not issued any export licenses for munitions to Japan since February 4, 1938. As for Germany, it is selling large quantities of munitions to China. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper's Attempt at Self-Justification</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese evening newspapers believe that the US declaration of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty has damaged the goodwill between the two countries. Japanese political figures say that the US government wants to abrogate the treaty in order to prepare to prohibit US merchants from selling and transporting military goods to Japan, while Japanese economic figures believe that the US abrogation implies an economic challenge to Japan. They speculate that the US government consulted with the British government before taking this step, with the motive of strengthening the position of the British in the Tokyo talks and giving Japan a psychological blow. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The "China and Foreign Commercial News" cited trade statistics from last year as proof, saying that Japan purchased oil, iron, copper, and raw cotton from the US, worth 915,353,000 yen, while Japanese goods sold to the US, such as raw silk, canned food, cotton cloth, and porcelain, were only worth 425,123,000 yen. The newspaper also said that because silk is indispensable to the lives of Americans, there are 200,000 Americans working in the silk industry. It believes that the US government cannot force a large reduction in Japanese silk imports. After the treaty is abrogated, a major ban on the export of military goods to Japan will follow.

<h3>Fourth Anglo-Japanese Conference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department announced that the fourth Anglo-Japanese conference was held twice at the residence of the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM on July 27. In the morning, the details of police procedures that could be implemented in the future were discussed and brought to a conclusion. In the afternoon, economic issues were deliberated. It was decided that the next conference would be held at 10:00 AM on the 28th. (Domei, 27th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States Abrogates the US-Japan Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Gloomy clouds are all around, the wind and rain are mournful, it seems as if the sky is about to fall, as if the land is about to sink, ghostly shadows flit about, it seems as if mankind is about to be destroyed. It is at this moment that a thunderclap brings sudden enlightenment! How can one not believe that the influence of the US government's sudden announcement the other night to abrogate the US-Japan Commercial Treaty extends to the entire international phenomenon, both past and future!</p>
<p>The existing US-Japan Commercial Treaty was signed in 1911 and has been in effect for 28 years. It is based on friendship, equality, and mutual benefit, and its scope covers commerce and navigation. The announcement of its abrogation was made in Washington on the evening of July 26, which is the morning of the 27th in Shanghai. The procedure for abrogation was a formal notification from the US government to the Japanese government. The reason for the abrogation is "to better protect American interests." The implementation of the abrogation will take effect six months from the date of the announcement, i.e., beginning on January 26, 1940.</p>
<p>Taking the abrogation of the commercial treaty itself, focusing on the commerce and navigation of the US and Japan, and the agricultural and industrial sectors that are closely related to them as a whole, as well as national finance, the national economy, and even the daily lives of the general public, the implications of the existence or abrogation of the treaty cannot be exaggerated in magnitude, and the aspects that can be discussed cannot be overstated in number. Let us not say that even discussing this is not the most urgent matter at present, nor can it be fully explained in a short newspaper commentary. Moreover, this action by this country on this day has significance and implications that extend far beyond the scope of a commercial treaty. Please allow a general account.</p>
<p>Before the US government announced the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty the other night, there were many in the US government and public who discussed it for a year, but they had no direct relationship to the current measures. This is evidenced by the fact that a month ago, the US authorities, regarding the application of the established law of imposing special taxes on German goods to Japan, were still acting cautiously and hesitating to act. A week ago, some US Congressmen suggested abrogating the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, but it also had no direct relationship to the current measures. The bill had not yet been reviewed, had not yet been put on the agenda, let alone voted on and passed into law. This is further evidenced by the fact that Secretary of State Hull's response to inquiries a few days ago still stated that this session was unlikely to discuss this matter and that it would have to wait until next year. It can thus be seen that this decision to announce the abrogation of the treaty was indeed made decisively in response to the most pressing current situation and was by no means a pre-planned strategy from days or months ago. Yesterday, Reuters' Washington dispatch called it a sudden occurrence, unexpected, like the explosion of a bomb; such is the case for good reason. However, this only refers to the action; in terms of the overall situation, American interests have been greatly eroded and discriminated against, and the spirit and foundation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had long been abandoned by the Japanese side; thus, the current abrogation can be said to be a natural measure. Moreover, since the outbreak of the Far East incident, the US government, for several years, whether issuing declarations, diplomatic notes, or protests, has invariably emphasized its determination to protect American interests; listeners may have been few, but speakers have been earnest. Thus, the current abrogation can be said to be a measure that has been repeatedly forewarned. The action is sudden, but the nature is not sudden.</p>
<p>The impact of this move by the United States on the entire international phenomenon and the future trends of the international situation will certainly have objective and concrete facts, which will gradually be recognized by the world and future generations in the near future. This is by no means our extravagant hope, nor does it require today's predictions. For there are things that are inevitable, and there are forces that cannot be resisted. However, to predict a certain dispute or a certain problem for the sake of pleasure is merely to stimulate emotions that are harmful and useless, and it can well be stopped. What can be discussed in general is that the US, in its recent congressional discussions of the Neutrality Act, has shown the weaknesses of party politics and the predicament of President Roosevelt in political struggles. However, this sudden declaration of the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is clear proof of the absolute consensus of both parties on foreign policy. Senator Vandenberg and others, Republican senators in the US opposition, have already declared that they will not use foreign policy as a tool of political struggle, and the so-called isolationists, politically speaking, do not entirely take party affiliation as a boundary, and ideologically, they firmly advocate isolation on European issues, while they mostly advocate active involvement in the Far East and Latin America. Therefore, this decisive measure is by no means a unilateral decision by the authorities but is supported by the full strength of the entire United States. This is the first thing that should be recognized. For several years, from the Far East to Africa to Europe, the actions of aggressor nations have been almost universally successful, and the arrogance of aggressor nations has been almost impossible to blunt. Thus, their desires have become more extravagant, and their momentum has increased. What they fear is the United States, and what they are flattering is the United States, thinking that if they treat it with respect and keep it at a distance, it will no longer stand in their way. Indeed, the national power and position of the United States are truly pivotal in the international arena and cannot be compared with by any aggressor nation or even aggressor group. And this decisive measure, which is said to be a declaration of the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, is rather a declaration of determination to stop aggression in the Far East. Seeing this, "the greedy will become honest!" This is administering the right medicine for the illness, the second point. Countries that have fallen to aggressors have done nothing but gain the world's sympathy. Yet there is a country that braves all difficulties and endures great pain to resist violence, to defend independence and freedom through war, to sacrifice for justice, and to be in the forefront of the common interests of friendly nations. This is what maintains the world's faltering faith in justice and has unparalleled value. However, what two years of resistance have contributed to the world is that Britain's one knee in Tokyo has almost made the world suspect that justice has fallen to the ground beyond recovery. And now, the US measures have not only given the resistance fighters deeper confidence and revived the general public's sense of justice, but also, at this urgent moment, can "make the cowards stand!" This is turning the tide, the third point.</p>
<p>Alas! Mankind should indeed be civilized animals who take freedom and equality as the principles of life. In recent years, those who can oppose freedom and advocate shackles, and those who can oppose equality and advocate conquest, are practicing their anti-civilization ways. As the wind blows, the grass bends. The cowardly have followed suit, bowing their heads and lowering their hearts, either being shackled, conquered, or shamelessly seeking their own well-being, siding with shackles and conquest, and sitting idly by as freedom and equality decline and fall. Today, the United States has raised its voice from a high place, deafening the deaf and opening the eyes of the blind, proving that mankind can still be civilized animals. International relations should be based on mutual respect for sovereignty and mutual respect for independence. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to destroy everything by violence and to dominate everything by violence. At the extreme, there is only violence as a trackless track. And today's actions by the United States are both the beginning of clearing up the international situation and restoring order, and the basic work of laying the foundation for order. This is a historical measure of civilization and a historical measure of international relations. When things reach an extreme, they will surely reverse; the time is not far off. But will the violent take advantage of the period between about to reverse and not yet reversed, to act out their most violent acts and attempt a final struggle? This is what those who are determined to promote human civilization and restore international order should be fully vigilant about and jointly address.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Decides to Abrogate Treaty: Nearly Unprecedented in American History; Upholding Rights and Opposing Aggression: A Prelude to the Embargo of Munitions</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt yesterday first summoned the Far Eastern Affairs Advisor, then received Secretary of State Hull, and agreed to abrogate the treaty. The note of abrogation was then delivered to the Japanese Ambassador. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The abrogation of the U.S.-Japan treaty was unexpected by those concerned. Yesterday at 11:30 AM, Secretary of State Hull summoned reporters to the State Department and announced the news of the abrogation. The United States is the largest supplier of military goods needed by Japan, including cotton, steel, iron, and gasoline, all necessities for warfare. The United States is a particularly large supplier. Those who support the arms embargo generally believe that the implementation of an embargo against Japan can prevent Japan's aggression against China or force Japan to withdraw its aggression. Opponents say that this action leads to war, believing that Japan will retaliate. From then on, the two countries will retaliate against each other endlessly, eventually leading to war. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government's announcement of the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is regarded by diplomatic circles as a warning to Japan. Regarding this matter, Senator Vandenberg, a Republican, previously submitted a proposal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After the committee decided to postpone further discussion until next week, there was a misunderstanding as to what the U.S. attitude would be. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull therefore decided to announce the abrogation. Secretary of State Hull has notified Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi and instructed the U.S. Embassy in Japan to notify Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Political figures here stated in firm tones that the U.S. government only needs to announce the abrogation of the Most Favored Nation clause, and the proposal made by Biderman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (that is, a proposal to authorize the President to prohibit the shipment of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that destroy the Nine-Power Treaty), can be submitted to the Senate for a vote and passed without difficulty. Now, the U.S. government has decided to abrogate the entire U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, which is due to political reasons. The U.S. government's abrogation of a commercial treaty for purely political reasons, except during the French Revolution when French pirates attacked American merchant ships, resulting in the abrogation of the U.S.-France commercial treaty, is almost without precedent. Judging from this, the U.S. policy toward China will still maintain the principle of "Open Door," and clearly indicate that when necessary, it will retaliate against countries that violate this principle, regardless of the policies of other countries toward China. As for the various incidents that have recently occurred in China, such as the beating of Baker, the clerk of the U.S. gunboat Guam, by Japanese soldiers in Hankou last week, the Japanese blockade of Guangzhou, or any harm to American residents, the U.S. government cannot condone them. Now, before implementing a "sanctions policy," that is, before prohibiting the shipment of arms and ammunition to Japan, the U.S. is giving the Japanese government six months to change its policy in China. Regarding this matter, American public opinion generally believes that actions within China are becoming increasingly apparent. Although the reasons why Britain must compromise with Japan after the establishment of a preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan in Tokyo can be understood, the sentiment of hoping that the United States will take positive action is becoming stronger. The State Department therefore decided to announce the abrogation in order to satisfy general public opinion. Political figures here also said that Secretary of State Hull issued a statement on the 19th of last month, restating the policy toward China (briefly stating that although the Tianjin incident has nothing to do with the United States, its development and significance are of great concern to the U.S. government, judging from what has been seen and heard in other parts of China in the past and now). In view of the various incidents that have occurred again in China, this policy must be promoted in a warning manner." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government's announcement of the abrogation of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has been endorsed by Senator Biderman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Vandenberg, the Republican who proposed the abrogation of the treaty. Vandenberg said, "This action by the government is commendable. Considering the interests preserved by the United States in the Far East, the situation this year is significantly different from when this treaty was signed in 1911. A new treaty must be drafted to adapt to reality. Our country has now given Japan six months to see if that country is willing to continue to maintain friendly relations with our country. Our country is no longer bound by this outdated treaty and can negotiate a new treaty with Japan to protect our rights." Biderman said, "This is a meaningful and well-founded action."

<h3>China Purchases Machinery for Manufacturing U.S. Transport Vehicles</h3>
<p>Buffalo, USA. The Stewart-Maddi Transport Vehicle Manufacturing Company was liquidated automatically in February of this year. The machinery in the factory has now been purchased by the Chinese. It is widely believed that the machinery will be shipped to China. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>US Determined to Preserve Face in Far East</h3>
<p>(Washington) The New York Times stated in its news column that this action by the U.S. authorities shows that the U.S. is not only safeguarding its rights in the Far East but is also prepared to take retaliatory action if Japan infringes on its rights. If Japan repeatedly uses actions such as Japanese soldiers beating Americans in China to deliberately make the U.S. lose face in the Far East, then Orientals should know that the U.S. is doing its best to maintain its dignity and is dealing with Japan in the only language that a government ruled by warlords can understand. This action by the U.S. has shown Japan and the world that although Britain may have made some concessions in the Tianjin issue, the U.S. will not do so. The newspaper's Washington dispatch stated that President Roosevelt decided to take this action when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee postponed the discussion of the treaty abrogation proposal. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet and Japanese Troops Confront Each Other on Both Banks of the Khalkha River</h3>
<p>Bairshagal, 26th. Last night, Japanese artillery units heavily shelled the Soviet artillery positions on the opposite bank of the Khalkha River. It is also reported that as of the 27th, Japanese-Manchu troops and Soviet troops are confronting each other across the river in the Khalkha River battle. (Domei, 27th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters announced that the Soviet troops who crossed the border in the Nomonhan area on July 23 are currently engaged in combat after the Japanese counterattack and are shelling Soviet artillery positions on the opposite bank of the Khalkha River. Japanese troops defending the Khalkha River are closely monitoring the Soviet troops. (Domei, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Naval Ministry stated at a press conference today that the Japanese Navy has decided and is prepared to protect Japan's legitimate rights in Sakhalin Island. The Soviet government apparently wants to confiscate coal mines and oil fields owned by the Japanese. These industries were recognized by the Soviet government as compensation for the massacre of 700 Japanese residents in Nikolaevsk-on-Amur in 1920. The Japanese Navy is currently closely monitoring the development of the diplomatic negotiations underway in Moscow. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Shaken in Central Hubei; Chinese Troops Advance on Suixian; Japanese Troops in Zhongxiang Hold Fast; Transportation Between Yuekou and Qianjiang Cut Off</h3>
<p>Fancheng. The Japanese troops in central Hubei are extremely panicked due to the Chinese army's continuous attacks. Anlu, which is more than 400 li away from the former front line in central Hubei and which the Japanese army has used as a military base in central Hubei, has also been shaken. Currently, there are 40-50 Japanese military vehicles carrying Japanese corpses and important military supplies away from Anlu. Lugudun, a stronghold near Suixian, was recaptured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 25th, killing more than 70 Japanese soldiers and seizing two Japanese cannons. The first to attack Lugudun was a brave team from a certain Chinese unit. When the team entered the Japanese阵地, they threw more than 100 hand grenades and fought fiercely with the Japanese army.

<h3>Even If Britain Cancels Aid, the Chinese Can Still Fight: Weng Wenhao's Statement; If Britain Wants to Protect Its Interests in the Far East, It Must Take a Tough Stance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Economic Minister Weng Wenhao, speaking to the Associated Press reporter today, even if Britain completely cancels its aid to China, we can fight at any time. Our soldiers are also loyal, brave, and persevering. We must think about future generations. Although we need foreign loans, we have no other hope other than loans. This is also the general opinion of the Chinese here. Also, according to the English-language Chu Bao today, if Britain accepts the Japanese demands, it can at most temporarily protect its interests in the Far East. However, if the British can take a tough stance, Japan, because of the danger of war, will be able to adapt and withdraw its demands. Japan is now trying to use bluffing and intimidation to obtain from Britain everything it cannot achieve in China through war. Therefore, the only way to deal with Japan is to expose its bluffing. Because of Britain's firm stance in Europe, Danzig has been preserved. Therefore, if Britain can take the same stance in the Far East, it will be able to protect all its interests in the Far East. The newspaper then compared the military strength of Britain and Japan, believing that although Japan can seize British concessions and Hong Kong in China at the beginning of the war, Britain has control of the sea and economic power, which can lead to Japan's collapse. Moreover, Britain's subjugation of Japan in the Far East will not weaken its position in Europe. However, the worst strategy is to try to satisfy the insatiable desires of the aggressor. Some Chinese people believe that Britain's attitude towards China was extremely cold in the first year of the war. It was not until after the United States provided economic aid to China that Britain also made some gestures. If Britain abandons China in the future, the Chinese will never forget it. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The United Daily News here, after criticizing Britain's attitude at the Tokyo conference yesterday, today used a more moderate tone to comment on the matter, saying that Britain's attempt to compromise with Japan is enough to encourage the seizure of the rights and interests of third countries in China. In order to protect its own interests and fulfill its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the resolutions passed by the League of Nations, Britain should not change its policy in China. British Prime Minister Chamberlain has already made a full statement in his speech in the House of Commons. After explaining that the Tokyo compromise plan is clearly inconsistent with the British Prime Minister's speech, the newspaper expressed that Britain's approval of the Tokyo plan is only an attempt to avoid immediate conflict with Japan at a time when the Anglo-French-Soviet pact has not yet been completed and the U.S. Neutrality Act has not yet been revised. At the same time, there is no sign of easing in the European situation. The newspaper continued that Britain's future actions are worthy of our attention. It must be known that appeasement policy can never satisfy the ambition of the aggressor, but only makes the relationship between Britain and other countries increasingly alienated. Finally, the newspaper asked the Chinese people to adopt a calm and patient attitude towards the Tokyo conference in order to avoid the conspiracy of the Japanese to undermine Sino-British friendship. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Governor of Hong Kong declared in the Legislative Council today, "I believe that the preliminary agreement signed in Tokyo does not foreshadow that Britain's policy towards China will be weaker than before. I solemnly declare that the outside world's misunderstanding is due to the intentional slander and dissemination of rumors by China's enemies and those who are ill-intentioned towards Britain, without solid evidence. However, the attitude clearly expressed by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons can be realized." (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>China Islamic National Salvation Association Holds Annual Meeting in Chongqing; President Chiang's Speech: Praising Muslims for Defending the Truth; Many Examples of Loyalty and Bravery in History</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) President Chiang delivered a speech yesterday at the annual meeting of the China Islamic National Salvation Association here, stating that the 50 million Muslims in China have made valuable contributions in terms of manpower, financial resources, and other forms in China's united resistance against Japanese aggression. More than 200 Islamic leaders attended the meeting, as well as many high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, who is the chairman of the association, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, and Minister of Education Chen Lifu. President Chiang praised the Muslims' love of justice and fearless spirit of defending the truth and cited many historical examples of the loyalty and bravery of Chinese Muslims, such as Chang Yuchun of the Ming Dynasty. President Chiang also stressed the freedom of religious belief in China, saying that Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam coexist in China. There was a moving ceremony at the opening of the conference, in which the Chinese Islamic imam recited prayers from the Quran and prayed for the final victory of China. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

<h3>Sudden Turn in the Three-Power Talks; Agreement Expected Within Days; Definition of "Indirect Aggression" Largely Agreed Upon; Tripartite General Staff to Hold Talks; Soviet Foreign Minister Continues Talks with British and French Ambassadors Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, government sources have reportedly stated that Britain and France have jointly drafted new instructions with identical content. These will be telegraphed to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar, tonight. The ambassadors are expected to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov tomorrow evening to discuss the final obstacles to the political agreement, namely the definition of "indirect aggression" and the issue of tripartite general staff talks. France will be represented in these talks by General Huntziger, commander of troops in the Near East (Note: General Huntziger is a member of the Supreme Military Council and once represented France in talks with Turkish General Staff personnel), assisted by General Dumont of Lille, although this is not yet confirmed. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador Seeds and French Ambassador Naggiar is scheduled to continue today, with the aim of finalizing the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial Times recently reported, "According to news received here last night, the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may be signed today. Representatives of the general staffs of the respective countries will then quickly hold talks. Britain and the Soviet Union will also conduct trade negotiations, and Britain may request the Soviet government to send Trade Commissar Mikoyan to London, although this is not certain." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, Prime Minister Chamberlain will present a report to the House of Commons on the 31st of this month. The House of Commons, which was originally scheduled to debate foreign policy today, has also postponed the debate until the 31st. At that time, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Sir Archibald Sinclair, will be the first to raise questions. In addition, the House of Commons is scheduled to discuss on the 28th the establishment of an intelligence department during wartime and the establishment of an overseas propaganda bureau by the Foreign Office during peacetime. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to French official sources last night, although the military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has not yet been signed, a definite outcome can be expected within today. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) It is announced here that the selection of representatives for the British military delegation to Moscow is currently being made by the British government from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. It is said that there are two issues that must be discussed in the Anglo-French-Soviet general staff talks: (1) the issue of regular technical deployments of troops among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; (2) determining the scope and nature of Soviet assistance to Romania in wartime, as well as naval measures in the Baltic Sea. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday that if the Soviet Union wishes to hold general staff talks with British and French Army, Navy, and Air Force inspection teams, the Soviet Union is free to do so. Observers point out that these general staff talks will be the prelude to the conclusion of a tripartite military alliance. Chamberlain avoided questions from Labour Party members about whether Britain would send a military inspection team to Moscow, but admitted that the government had sent new instructions to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds. Chamberlain stated, "We have sent certain instructions to Moscow, but we have not yet received a response to those instructions." Liberal Party member Mendell questioned the Prime Minister whether France had sent an army inspection team to Moscow. Chamberlain replied, "The British and French governments are cooperating closely." Reliable sources within the government claim that the British government has approved a plan to send an army inspection team to Moscow. A Soviet spokesman here stated that the upcoming general staff talks will be a "true test of the strength of the alliance." (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here stated last night that the British and French governments have now accepted a definition of what constitutes an act of aggression against the Soviet Union. The Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations have therefore entered a favorable phase. Political figures in Britain and France are confident that the negotiations can be concluded in the short term. Britain and France have also agreed to convene a meeting of the general staffs of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is reported that the French military delegation will be headed by General Huntziger, a member of the French Supreme Defense Council and commander of the Levant Military District. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the only remaining difficulty is the definition of "indirect aggression." Soviet sources here stated that since Britain and France have acceded to the Soviet request to allow tripartite general staff talks, the Soviet side may accept a definition of indirect aggression that is satisfactory to Britain in return. Regarding this matter, the British government recently telegraphed new instructions to Ambassador Seeds in Moscow, explaining the British view and instructing him to convey it to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. If concrete results can be achieved in today's talks between the representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, a draft of the tripartite political agreement can be prepared and telegraphed to the British and French governments for their approval. The three governments will also issue a public statement on the 31st of this month, announcing that representatives of their respective general staffs will hold a meeting. Even if the talks today fail to reach an agreement on the definition of indirect aggression, an agreement should be reached on the content and date of the announcement. In addition, it is claimed that the Soviet side stated, "After the political agreement among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is concluded, Stalin will issue a letter to all countries of the world, declaring that since the Soviet Union has rejoined the international community, it will devote all its efforts to maintaining peace, and that domestically, it will focus on industrial and social reconstruction, neither threatening any country nor seeking any territorial gains. If this is the case, the countries along the Baltic Sea can be reassured." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to semi-official sources, General Dominot, commander of the French First Military District, will go to Moscow to participate in the Anglo-French-Soviet general staff talks. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign Minister Molotov is scheduled to meet with French Ambassador Naggiar, British Ambassador Seeds, and Mr. Strang, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, at 5:00 PM today to continue discussions on the conclusion of a political agreement among the three countries and the issue of tripartite general staff talks.

<h3>Polish Concerns: German Conspiracy Against Danzig; Rumors of Hitler's Inspection of East Prussia</h3>
<p>(Warsaw) It is widely rumored here that German leader Hitler plans to travel to East Prussia via the Free City of Danzig on August 25th or 26th to attend the commemoration ceremony of the Battle of Tannenberg during World War I. The German cruiser "Königsberg" will also sail to the port of Danzig on August 22nd. Some believe that this trip by Hitler will only provide the city of Danzig with an opportunity to once again express its desire to be annexed to Germany. However, political figures are deeply concerned that Hitler may issue a declaration in the Free City of Danzig that, while claiming to respect Poland's major rights in the city, is actually tantamount to declaring the annexation of the city to German territory. At the same time, the city authorities may also take various administrative measures to gradually eliminate the existing system in the city, such as (1) replacing passports issued by the Danzig Free City authorities with German passports; (2) replacing Danzig currency and stamps with German marks and stamps; (3) dissolving the city council and openly seizing power by the Nazi Party. If this happens, the annexation of the Free City of Danzig to Germany may be quietly realized, without any violent actions or German interference, which is a matter of great concern. However, Poland currently has an armory at Westerplatte in the port of Danzig, which serves as a military symbol of Poland's authority over the city. If the city is gradually annexed to Germany, how to deal with this armory will be a major difficulty. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>German Propaganda Ministry Retaliates Against British Press; Letters Sent to Prominent British Figures; Vehement Criticism of Colonel Kimche</h3>
<p>(London) After British political commentator Colonel Kimche repeatedly sent secret letters to the German people, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels reciprocated yesterday by sending multiple letters to prominent British figures, especially Scottish figures. Oddly, many golf club secretaries also received these letters, which were titled "Dr. Goebbels's Response to British Propaganda." The letter stated, "Colonel Kimche, We have noticed that you have sent pamphlets and letters to our people, claiming that you wish to get closer to our people. However, we know that you are employed by your country's Foreign Office. The writing, printing, and mailing of your letters and pamphlets are all authorized and funded by your country's Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax. Your true colors have now been exposed. This is unfortunate for you, but fortunate for us. Although this propaganda is extremely childish and laughable, it is extremely crude and hateful because it comes from Downing Street. In short, what you said is all fabricated. Please tell it to your sailors." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Royal Reception for Doctors Coming to China</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Horder, the royal physician to King George VI, and his wife hosted a reception today to welcome refugee doctors joining the Chinese Red Cross. Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi was also present. Horder said that the doctors joining the Chinese Red Cross are preparing to face the dangers and hardships of service in China, but they lack medical equipment to carry out their work. He hopes that generous people will donate medical equipment. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Parliament Majority Opposes New Cabinet</h3>
<p>(The Hague) It is now known that 32 members of the Catholic Party, 22 members of the Socialist Party, 6 members of the Radical Party, and 3 members of the Communist Party in the parliament will oppose Prime Minister Colijn's new government. Therefore, in theory, only 34 members support the government, while 62 members oppose it. However, at present, no opposition party intends to introduce a motion of "no confidence" in the government. Opposition parties are expected to become active around October when the 1940 budget is presented. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Intensifies</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) British residents in Tanggu and Dagu received warnings today from anti-British Chinese, asking them to leave the two places within four weeks. They also stated that if the British ignore this warning, they cannot guarantee the lives and property of the British in the two places. At the same time, the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions here has greatly intensified. British people passing through obstacles at the entrance and exit often have to wait for several hours before being allowed to pass. According to the British Consulate, there are 17 British people in Dagu and 11 in Tanggu. As of now, the British side has no preparations to evacuate the British people in the two places. However, women and children spent the night in a barge last night as a precaution. The British gunboat "Santon" is currently stationed in Tanggu for vigilance. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The anti-British tide in Tianjin has not subsided. British residents in Tanggu have now received threatening notices from the so-called Anti-British Committee, demanding that they leave the country within four weeks. If they are unable to leave the country within the deadline due to circumstances, they must notify the committee of the date they intend to leave so that the committee can treat them with "good intentions," but it does not guarantee their lives and property. The threatening notice ends with words such as "Farewell, and wish you a smooth journey." The British residents in Tanggu are mostly employees of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Kailan Mining Administration, and Butterfield &amp; Swire. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Continuous Bombings in London; Irish Terrorists Active; House of Commons Passes Prevention of Violence Act</h3>
<p>(London) Bombings occurred continuously in London today. The first incident occurred in the afternoon when two bombs exploded simultaneously in the cloakroom of King's Cross Station, killing one person on the spot and injuring 15 others. The second incident occurred in the evening when a bomb exploded in the luggage room of Victoria Station. The explosion was so powerful that it could be heard 900 yards away. Several people were injured at the time. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. The police authorities received the report and immediately implemented special security measures at various stations, especially at the Sitten Viaduct (the largest railway bridge in Britain) on the main line of the Great Northern Railway. (Havas, 26th) (London) As the House of Commons was passing the Prevention of Violence Act tonight, a bomb explosion at a station and shops outside the station destroyed them. It is believed that this was done by sympathizers of the Irish Republican Army. Two taxis were destroyed and 16 people were injured, one of whom died of serious injuries. The terrorists hid the bomb in a handbag and placed the bag in a locker in the luggage storage room on the platform. Another bomb exploded in the cloakroom of Victoria Station, blowing out windows. People fled in all directions, and smoke filled the station. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene, and the police also arrived immediately. Three porters and three others injured in the cloakroom were sent to the hospital. Two other porters were shaken up and treated at the station. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Prevention of Violence Act and the British Overseas Airways Act were both passed on the third reading in the House of Commons today and have been sent to the House of Lords. Members of Parliament were very angry after hearing about the recent bomb explosions in London. Therefore, the Prevention of Violence Act was quickly passed in five minutes. The proposal to add another day of consideration to this bill has now been withdrawn. The amended text of the motion, which stipulates that the detention period for suspects who have committed this crime must not exceed 48 hours, has been passed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Tests Blackout</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Starting tonight, sirens will sound throughout Hong Kong to test the blackout. Wartime lighting control will be continuous throughout the night. However, tonight's test will only be limited to when "enemy aircraft" are approaching. Once the all-clear is given, normal conditions will be restored. After the alarm is sounded, the city will first reduce lighting, and then all traffic will stop, and the city will be dark. Ferries traveling between Hong Kong and Kowloon will be suspended, and only navigation lights will be allowed on ships in the harbor. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Regarding Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<h3>International Law Expert Zhou Gengsheng Expresses His Views: If Britain Accepts the Various Conditions, It Will Violate the Nine-Power Treaty; Different Interpretations of the Plan; British Representatives Should Be Very Cautious</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since representatives of Britain and Japan held meetings in Tokyo, people at home and abroad have speculated and felt uneasy. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specifically visited international law expert Dr. Zhou Gengsheng, who expressed the following views: British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax have repeatedly stated that Britain's fundamental policy towards the Far East will not change due to the Tokyo meetings. Judging from the statements repeatedly issued by the British government and the treaties concluded by Britain with foreign countries, Britain's fundamental policy in the Far East can be divided into several points: (1) Britain cannot recognize de facto or de jure the situation created by the violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the treaties or agreements concluded by force or other means; (2) Providing moral and material assistance to China and not taking any actions that would weaken China's strength to resist Japan; (3) In principle, recognizing that Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant can be applied to the Sino-Japanese Incident and directly recognizing Japan as an aggressor; (4) Adhering to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty. Among the various conditions put forward by Japan in this Anglo-Japanese meeting, whether viewed from the perspective of principles or studied individually, if Britain accepts them, it will actually recognize de facto the situation created by Japan, and at the same time weaken China's strength to resist Japan. This would make it impossible for Britain to adhere to the provisions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant in writing or in spirit, and would violate all the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. Has Britain forgotten its moral and legal obligations? Is Britain unaware of Japan's conspiracy? Britain has always been a nation that values its promises. I personally believe that Britain will not do this. No matter what, just when the U.S. Congress and the press were discussing the implementation of economic sanctions and retaliation against Japan, the Tokyo meeting was suddenly held, giving a major blow to the calls for sanctions against Japan. This is regrettable. Moreover, Prime Minister Chamberlain's report in the House of Commons on the 24th of this month on the Klesh-Arita agreement is extremely vague in content. Therefore, the result will inevitably lead to various different interpretations. Japanese people like to make exaggerated interpretations of any agreement that are beneficial to them. At present, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and British Prime Minister Chamberlain have different views on the interpretation of the plan. For the sake of Britain's own interests and for the sake of Britain's allies, the British government and its representatives should be very cautious about the Tokyo meeting. At the same time, I hope that the people of the country should remain calm and not allow Sino-British friendship to be affected by this. In addition, we should also be vigilant at all times to avoid being misled by propaganda and making hasty judgments. (27th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Blockade Pearl River; Food Supply to Hong Kong Cut Off; A Small Number of Foreigners in Guangdong Searched by Japanese Soldiers; Chinese Entering and Leaving Shameen Subjected to Particularly Strict Searches</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The recent Japanese blockade of the Pearl River has cut off the food supply to Hong Kong and Macau. The cost of living here has therefore increased. The purpose of the Japanese blockade of the Pearl River is to force the majority of refugees here to return to Guangzhou and to strengthen the Japanese military position in the Guangzhou area because Japanese troops are encountering attacks from Chinese guerrillas there. Regarding Shameen, there is news that foreigners there are not panicked by rumors that Japanese troops will impose a "Tianjin-style blockade" around the foreign concessions. A small number of Europeans have been searched by Japanese sentries stationed around Shameen, but foreigners have not been harassed this week. Chinese entering and leaving the concession are subjected to strict searches. The Japanese authorities claim that the Japanese troops are conducting searches to prevent the smuggling of military currency into foreign concessions. It is said that Chinese speculators in Shameen have caused great fluctuations in the value of Japanese military currency. Japanese officials here claim that the Japanese blockade of the Pearl River is purely a military operation because Japanese troops are engaged in "mopping-up" operations in the Pearl River Delta. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The city-wide search of Chinese people, which began on July 21, stopped this morning. It is believed that Japanese soldiers have often been shot at by armed Chinese people, so the Japanese side took this search action. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Concerned About Unemployed Skilled Seafarers; Registration to be Completed Before the End of August</h3>
<p>(Ningbo Correspondence) The Ningbo Maritime Affairs Office recently received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, stating that since the outbreak of the war, many seafarers have become unemployed, and their lives are difficult. The Ministry is deeply concerned and should be coordinated by the government to provide relief and utilize them. It is instructed to investigate and report to the Ministry in detail for overall handling.

<h3>Japanese Troops in West Shanghai Rush to Build the Hongxin Road</h3>
<p>(Qingpu Correspondence) Japanese troops in West Shanghai, feeling threatened by the Chinese army, began rushing to build the Hongxin (Hongqiao-Xinqiao, Songjiang Prefecture) Road on the 23rd. The road builders are mostly villagers from the nearby area, in addition to some Japanese troops from West Shanghai. The road project is extremely simple, which shows the urgency of the need. It is generally expected that because the military strength in West Shanghai is insufficient to cope, the Japanese side intends to use transportation to increase the deployment of troops from Songjiang and other places at any time in order to defend against the advance of the Chinese army. Yesterday afternoon, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers, disguised as Chinese merchants, took two civilian boats to spy near Qibao Town, Puhuitang. They were discovered by Chinese troops, who immediately dispatched more than 20 elite soldiers to attack. The Japanese troops retreated towards Xujiahui.</p>
<h3>Opening of Irrigation Gate Along the Canal to Release the Yellow River and Huai River Flooding</h3>
<p>(Xinghua Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered the Canal Works Bureau and the Huai'an County Government to open all the sluice gates along the canal to prevent the rise of the Yellow River and Huai River and to take care of farmland irrigation, considering that the water level in the lower reaches of the river was low. It is now known that the Provincial Government has successively reported from the Canal Works Bureau that the Gaoyou City North Toutou Sluice, City South Huoyao Sluice, Wanlü'an, Tubu, Pipa Sluice, and Tonghu Bridge have been completely cleared. It also transferred the remaining sluice gates along the embankment and opened the sluice gates to the greatest extent possible to facilitate drainage. At the same time, the Provincial Government also reported from the Zhun'an County Government that the sluice gates within the county's jurisdiction had been completely opened long ago. However, because the riverbeds of the diversion rivers of each sluice gate are shallow and most of the mouths are silted up, the flow of each diversion river is very small. It has now been transferred and instructed the district chiefs of each district along the embankment in the county to requisition people to dredge the upper and lower diversion rivers of each sluice gate to facilitate unobstructed drainage.</p>
<h3>All of the Pseudo-Security Corps in Taicang Revolts</h3>
<p>(Taicang Correspondence) After Geng Chao, the deputy commander of the Taicang Pseudo-Security Corps, was killed in a design ambush by the 4th Regiment of the 2nd District Security Force of Jiangsu Province in Xintang City last month and more than 100 pseudo-soldiers were captured, the Japanese authorities immediately transferred several military officers and brought more than 100 pseudo-soldiers who had been tricked by Geng Chao to the county seat for training to Xintang to fill the defense and assist the pseudo-county government in collecting land taxes. At that time, the commanders of the Jiangnan Volunteer Army, He Kexi and Wu Gang, led more than 1,000 combatants to Taicang County, contacted Wang Shilan, the commander of the 4th Regiment, and attacked Xintang City in groups at 2:00 a.m. on the 3rd. The combatants of the Liao Detachment first climbed onto the Japanese soldiers' housing and threw hand grenades, bombing and killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers and capturing two alive. As soon as the pseudo-Security Corps members heard that the guerrillas had arrived, they fled in all directions. Later, the pseudo-soldiers were motivated by patriotism and intended to revolt. Director Tang learned that the pseudo-soldiers had such an intention to revolt and ventured to persuade them. The pseudo-army captain scheduled an uprising to implement the revolt. Unexpectedly, the matter was not confidential and was discovered by the Japanese military department. Suddenly, on the 17th, a large number of Japanese troops were dispatched to surround Xintang City, intending to confiscate the pseudo-soldiers' guns. Before the Japanese troops arrived, the team leader, Cang Shenxiu, and others led more than 100 team members, each carrying a rifle, to withdraw from Xintang City and rushed to Wang's regiment to surrender. Regiment Commander Wang and Director Tang immediately reorganized the unit and reported it to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Hastily Build Defenses in Suzhou, Chinese Regular Army Presses Forward Steadily</h3>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: All the towns and villages outside Fengmen in this county are in the waterlogged area, hence surrounded by water on all sides and the only waterway connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, due to the steady advance of the Chinese regular army, the Japanese troops are engaged in building defensive works. For days, the Japanese army has been forcibly conscripting large numbers of Chinese people from inside and outside the city, assigning them to dig ingot-shaped trenches at strategic points in the surrounding countryside to prevent attacks by the Chinese army. According to those who have been conscripted and returned, they were first detained in wooden houses after being conscripted by the Japanese army. Around 10 PM, large numbers of laborers were escorted onto barges specifically for transporting goods, towed by motorboats, and taken to the wilderness outside Fengmen. Observing the terrain, it seemed to be between Chefang and Xietang. They lit specially prepared kerosene lamps during work, and after six hours of work, they were ordered back onto the boats and returned to the original place. This went on for seven days, but the locations varied each day, sometimes near Taihu Lake. During these seven days, they were never fed adequately. Their work involved either transporting mud to build earth forts or digging trenches five feet deep, with the tasks varying from day to day. During each work session, countless Chinese people were knocked down by the Japanese army using wooden sticks.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Taixian, Prosperous Areas Also Suffer Tragic Bombing</h3>
<p>Taixian Special Dispatch: At 8:21 AM on the 23rd of this month, three Japanese planes were suddenly spotted over the city of Taixian, circling for about an hour. They first strafed the city with machine guns, and then indiscriminately bombed the most prosperous commercial areas outside the city, including Beida Street and Pozi Street, causing damage to Tianfu Silk and Cloth Store, the nearby Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant, money shops, clothing stores, and department stores. Several bombs also fell on the open areas around the large parade ground inside the city, but fortunately, there were no major casualties. This was because the people maintained order and obeyed the instructions of the air defense personnel during the circling and bombing of the Japanese planes, and their attitude was exceptionally calm. In addition, women and children had already been evacuated.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Increases Production, Improves Cotton Production</h3>
<p>Xinghua Dispatch: In order to increase production, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department is improving the cotton production in the coastal counties of the province and improving agricultural products throughout the province. It has specifically scheduled meetings for August 1st and 2nd at the Dongtai Cotton Production Improvement Office, convening the heads of various agricultural organizations and agricultural sites under its jurisdiction to hold various meetings. It has also ordered that any proposals be prepared in advance and submitted for discussion and joint research to benefit improvement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land in Wen's Territory</h3>
<p>Wenling Dispatch: In Shitan and Liangxiang towns of this county, 200 Japanese soldiers forcibly landed under the cover of Japanese warships with cannons and airplanes, starting at 10 AM on the 4th. They removed all the original doorplates and replaced them with newly ordered doorplate numbers, and rushed to build fortifications. Although the local people had evacuated in advance and retreated with the army, all the food and utensils in their homes were taken away. The Japanese army is now advancing towards Songmen, and the Chinese army is bravely fighting back. They are currently holding their ground in the Shangmashi area. It is also reported that there are two female soldier teams in Shitan and Zhushan, one being the 7th team and the other being the 9th team, which proves that the Japanese army is short of conscripts.</p>

<p>(Lishui Dispatch) In order to discuss the implementation plan for moral education in secondary schools and to promote youth training during the period of resistance against Japan and national construction, the Zhejiang Education Department has scheduled to convene the Second Zhejiang Provincial Secondary School Moral Education Conference in Lishui in mid-August, gathering principals and moral education directors (or guidance directors) of public and private secondary schools throughout the province.

<h3>The Number of Schools in This City is Increasing Daily, New Schools are Springing Up Like Bamboo Shoots After the Rain</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the cultural and educational institutions in this city have suffered heavy losses, and the number of unemployed students has reached over 100,000. More than 200 schools of all levels in areas such as Hunan, Zhabei, and Hongkou have been closed. After the war shifted westward, schools in the concession areas resumed classes one after another. Due to the rapid increase in population and the growing number of students seeking education, the education sector has been establishing new schools like bamboo shoots after the rain to meet the needs of the times. Moreover, many schools have moved to Shanghai from other cities. Therefore, the education sector in this city has been quite developed in recent years. According to a survey by educators, the latest statistics for schools of all levels in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>In the two years since the war, there have been dramatic changes in schools of all levels in this city. In addition to the expansion of enrollment in existing schools to accommodate out-of-school students, more than 100 new schools have been established. In total, there are more than 760 schools of all levels in the city, with more than 300,000 students. Among them, there were a total of 33 schools above the specialized college level before the war. Two schools were closed after the war, one school moved to the interior, four schools moved to Shanghai from other cities, and fourteen new schools were established, for a total of 48 schools, an increase of 15 schools compared to before the war. Secondary schools, including senior high schools, junior high schools, normal schools, and vocational schools that are registered and unregistered, together with those that existed before the war and those newly established after the war, and those that moved from other cities, total more than 270 schools, most of which are in rural areas. After the war, Hunan, Zhabei, and Hongkou became war zones, and all schools were closed early. There are about 400 public and private schools in the concession areas, including those that existed before the war and those newly established after the war. It is said that there are more than a dozen schools currently preparing to be newly established, and it is expected that the number will increase significantly next semester.</p>

<h3>Finance - Wild Surges and Plunges: Spot Reached the 4,000 Yuan Mark; Cancellation of the US-Japan Treaty Triggers Reversal</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot black market price of Gold Bullion (烚赤) continued its fluctuating state. Generally, it rose first and then fell, with a difference of 175 yuan between the high and low points. Initially, due to news that HSBC was more willing to buy than sell in the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate tightened, and market sentiment was bullish. Although some money changers initially tended to sell, securities firms and certain gold shops aggressively absorbed currency, further supported by a money changer who stopped selling and started buying as prices rose. The market once reached a high of 4,015 yuan. Later, a Reuters telegram reported the cancellation of the US-Japan commercial treaty, and the domestic foreign exchange market strengthened, causing pessimistic sentiment to dissipate. Many operators quickly shifted their targets and tended to close out positions. However, buyers hesitated during the decline, and the market eventually closed at 3,865 yuan, a net increase of 70 yuan. There were many twists and turns during the day, but no significant turbulence. Due to the supply of negotiable instruments and cash, transactions were mostly small-scale, with a total of over 1,000 taels. Gold jewelry prices also rose and then fell. The Greater Shanghai Jewellers Association once created an unprecedented high price of 405 yuan, eventually closing up 5 yuan. Customs Gold remained flat, while Chinese Gold and other types of pure gold continued to rise.</p>
<p>Gold Bullion Still Up 70 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, operators initially raised prices by 65 yuan per bar (ten taels) because they saw reports that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee would no longer maintain the foreign exchange rate of the non-occupied areas. Furthermore, there were rumors that HSBC was more willing to buy than sell in the domestic foreign exchange market, further boosting market confidence. Gold shops bought ten taels from money changers at a price of 3,860 yuan. A certain money changer suddenly tried to sell over a hundred taels, causing a temporary pullback. A money changer sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,850 yuan, and then sold another 30 taels to gold shops at a price of 3,840 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Although a certain money changer still intended to sell, the tightening of foreign exchange rates triggered buying. A certain gold shop (acting for Hong Kong speculators) and securities firms competed to absorb currency, and the market quickly rebounded. Soon, it broke through the 3,900 yuan mark. Securities firms bought ten taels from gold shops at a price of 3,920 yuan. Later, a certain money changer aggressively sold over a hundred taels again, so the price fell back below the 3,900 yuan mark. A money changer sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop (acting for Hong Kong speculators) at a price of 3,860 yuan. However, soon after, news came that the foreign exchange rate was tightening, and the securities firms absorbed currency again. In addition, a certain money changer also stopped selling and started buying, causing the upward trend to resume vigorously and again surpass the 3,900 yuan mark. A money changer bought a total of 20 taels from gold shops at a price of 3,960 yuan. This was around noon. Later, the same money changer bought another ten taels from gold shops at 3,950 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, news came that the US dollar exchange rate had weakened by 38 yuan, so the market was even stronger, opening up 60 yuan and breaking through the 4,000 yuan mark. Money changers bought 20 taels from cash shops at a price of 4,010 yuan. Then they raised the price by five yuan again, and money changers bought 30 taels from cash shops at a price of 4,015 yuan, which was the highest price of the day. At one point, it hovered between 4,010 yuan and 4,000 yuan. Around 2:30 PM, news came that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had been cancelled, and the foreign exchange rate weakened. The market price immediately reversed. Securities firms and cash shops competed to sell aggressively. In addition, gold shops also tracked and hedged sales, and buyers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The market successively broke through the 4,000 yuan and 3,900 yuan marks. Cash shops sold 30 taels to money changers at a price of 3,860 yuan. Later, money changers traded 50 taels among themselves at 3,865 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it still closed up 70 yuan compared to the previous day. (It was heard that after the close, securities firms sold another ten taels to cash shops at a price of 3,860 yuan.) It has risen for four consecutive days, a total of 395 yuan. The price fluctuated by 175 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current brand gold from bullion shops is about 10 yuan higher than that of the Gold Bullion (烚赤), and the spot price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there were some transactions.</p>
<h3>Importers Compete to Buy; Sterling Strengthens Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. The black market for sterling fluctuated greatly. Initially, due to the newspaper reports that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee would no longer maintain the black market, importers were very panicked and competed to buy aggressively. In addition, Chinese cotton yarn merchants and Japanese banks were also active. Furthermore, the Bank of England and HSBC sold very little spot currency and were very willing to buy, causing the market to tighten significantly. At one point, sterling was called over four shillings and 625 pence, and the US dollar was also called over 7.875 yuan. Later, a Reuters telegram reported that the US Senate had passed the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty signed in 1911, causing buyers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. In addition, sudden and continuous selling from Hong Kong telegraphs and the Bombay Bank caused the tightening trend to be less severe. At noon, it was heard that the Bank of England was closing out its positions for this month and arbitraging into August, posting a premium of US$0.0875, a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 1.15 cents. Trading was still active. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened sharply, and the selling price was reportedly softened to 28 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Offer Very Little</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate was down 1.875 for both near and far dates. The New York silver price was stable. The London gold price was up half a penny. The exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar was down slightly by 3 cents, and the exchange rate with Shanghai was down 125. The exchange rate with France remained flat. The exchange rate between the US dollar and sterling was unchanged. The exchange rate with Shanghai was down 15 cents, and the exchange rate with France was unchanged. The listed rates of the Central Bank were the same as before. The opening spot selling prices of banks in the morning were 4 shillings and 3475 pence for sterling and 8.4375 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the closing prices of the previous day. After the opening, exporters first sold spot sterling to HSBC at 4 shillings and 375 pence. Then, importers came to buy, but HSBC offered very little and was very willing to buy, but slightly sold August futures. The market softened. When the HSBC listed prices were announced, they were unchanged. When the Silver Balancing Tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, foreign firms settled and bought spot US dollars from a certain bank at 8.375 yuan. After 10:30 AM, more foreign firms closed short positions. In addition, Chinese merchants, such as cotton yarn merchants, were also active, causing the market to tighten further.

Suddenly, foreign news reported that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty signed in 1911 had been cancelled, so the buying from speculators and foreign firms stopped. In addition, foreign cables from Hong Kong and the Bombay Bank came to sell aggressively, so prices gradually strengthened. Hong Kong telegraphs and the Bombay Bank successively sold spot sterling to foreign firms and foreign banks, strengthening from 4 shillings and 1625 pence to 21875 pence.

<h3>Foreign Currency Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies rose sharply due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates and the sharp rise in Gold Bullion (烚赤). Demand was strong, and market prices soared. In the afternoon, news came that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had been abolished, and the supply became smoother. The market situation stabilized.

<h3>Securities - Far Eastern Bank Shares Rise; Chinese Domestic Debt Remains Weak</h3>
<p>The securities black market weakened again yesterday after rising for two consecutive days. Gold and debentures continued to rise endlessly. Public confidence in exchange drafts and bills weakened further. Public bonds are in a sense exchange drafts, and their environment is surrounded by various factors, so they cannot rise. Most transactions on the market aim to close out positions with small profits. Very few investors exist, and the tendency is that buying is not easy to raise, and selling is easy to slump when entries and exits are slightly large, which is in the reverse proportion to the situation in the first half of June. The surrounding haze does not dissipate, and it is not easy to hope for a rise. It can be said that it is a turbulent time. Yesterday's transactions were even worse. Neither buying nor selling was enthusiastic. Lianhe, Tongkang and other firms bought slightly more, while Songmao sold more than bought. Northern merchants were still selling, such as the 14th, Defu 8th and Tongyu. The range of rises and falls has become smaller. As a result, except for Grade A which was stable, the rest all fell by 0.1 to 0.6 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 400,000. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Grade A	52.20	51.20	52.00	Flat</p>
<p>Grade B	43.40	42.80	43.40	Down 0.10</p>
<p>Grade C	42.00	41.45	41.80	Down 0.55</p>
<p>Grade D	41.30	40.50	41.00	Down 0.60</p>
<p>Grade E	41.70	41.15	41.35	Down 0.60</p>
<p>For stock transactions, 180 shares of China Bookstore were traded at a price of 26.4 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Public Securities Exchange, all stocks in this city continued to show weakness yesterday. However, there were no crowded sellers on the market, but only those who settled foreign exchange for July had to settle their payments next Monday. This day also happened to be the settlement day of this exchange. Since the forward exchange rate was even higher, the exchange forced the sale of stocks that were easy to sell to obtain funds, so the prices of each stock fell, and the closing market was very weak. The comparison between the opening price and the closing price is listed below:</p>
<p>Opening	Closing</p>
<p>Tram Stock	42.75 yuan	41.5 yuan</p>
<p>Jardine Stock	19.1 yuan	18.5 yuan</p>
<p>Telephone Stock	12.6 yuan	11.8 yuan</p>
<p>Electricity Preference Stock	120 yuan	117.5 yuan</p>
<p>Previous Stock</p>
<p>The recent new low price was seen again today, such as the International Trust share price of 3.25 yuan, the Wharf share price of 29.5 yuan, and the Yesson share price of 112 yuan. Rubber stocks were also affected by this, and the price was still stable.</p>
<p>London British Far East Companies' share prices on the 26th of this month (Wednesday) were mostly up and less down. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of £6 12s 6d. HSBC shares rose by half a pound each, with British registered shares at £78 1/2 and Hong Kong registered shares at £78. Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares fell back by 1.5 pence, with a price of 12 shillings and 10.5 pence. The market price of Chinese foreign debt was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn - Strong Bullish Sentiment; Buying Resumes in the Yarn Market; Much Arbitrage in Japanese Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned up, because gold rose again, and rumors abounded, saying that there were more foreign exchange rumors. Although actual demand was clear, the market was covered by strong bullish sentiment, and actual buying resumed. The current price of 20s Double Horse was high, and it would meet 561 yuan. However, demand in South China decreased greatly. It was heard in the afternoon that exchange drafts continued to contract, and black market transactions increased compared to the morning. The price of a 10s Double Horse warehouse receipt was 555 yuan, and the 20s Special Golden City saw a new peak price of 630 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn: At the beginning of the morning opening, because rumors were rife, and the market unanimously looked good, the opening price was still flat, up 3-4 yuan. The price of 20s Double Horse foreign warehouse stock was 557 yuan. However, warehouse receipt stock was more profitable, with the opening price at 545 yuan, plus 5-6 yuan. But actual demand was average, and the Hong Kong merchants' purchasing capacity was very narrow. The market situation was still peaceful, but the general practitioners were very bullish and their thoughts were very strong, so they came to buy again, and with the good news, they moved forward again. The closing price of 20s Double Horse foreign warehouse stock was 560 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 546.5 yuan. It was found that 805 packages were traded in half a day, and 90 packages were traded in the afternoon of the previous day. The prices of 20s Double Horse rose by 6 yuan, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 7 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 120 packages of 20s Special Golden City, with a price of 630 yuan, which was taken by the Hong Kong merchants. Today, 1,250 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong, 120 pieces will be shipped to Beihai, and 120 pieces will be shipped to Guangzhou Bay. The amounts bought by each gang are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Dealers	570	Hong Kong	235</p>
<p>Statistics	805</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market rose sharply. The price of this month's goods has risen very strongly, but actual demand has not developed very much. The popularity is very strong. The factors for its firmness are that the yarn market has been weak for a long time, and the price difference between this month and next month is too large, which has attracted arbitrage. Therefore, the situation has tightened, and the rising power has become stronger. The current price of 20s Yueqin is 427-8 yuan, up 14 yuan, and the price for next month is 442 yuan. However, the debenture discount is still high.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factories Purchase Indian Cotton - All Transactions Are in Cash</h3>
<p>Indian cotton transactions: Japanese factories purchased exclusively well, importing 1,800 pieces, and all payments were made in cash to the factory. This cotton was all purchased by flower merchants in the past, and has been resold to Japanese factories, making a large profit. Chinese factories are still dull and do not purchase, probably due to the shortage of legal tender. However, the mutual buying and selling among the industry is still lively, and it is also a cash transaction. However, kapok business is quiet and lifeless. The source in Northern Jiangsu is still not interrupted. 249 packages of fine velvet flowers arrived at the dock. The current cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Another report: Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: due to the difficulty of financial adjustment, spot goods are not easy to sell for a while, so the selling price is more than ten yuan cheaper per dan than the fixed goods, and no one is interested in it for a while. In recent days, there have been a few people in the industry who have settled prices with foreign firms. This is a high view of the operators.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton market: the opening price of India rose by 2 pounds, and then rose due to telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai. Due to export subsidies, it attracted buying from many overseas merchants. Bank buying in the market was also very strong, and spot transactions turned active. Yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Henry Thielers announced the determination of New York, Washington, Savannah, New Orleans, Houston. Five places were designated as cotton export ports, and commissioners were stationed to handle export registration matters. Yesterday, New York rose by more than 10 pounds, India together with forecasts rose by 2 Robis, and Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Eastern Piece Squeezed Short; Domestic Cloth Slackens</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Although the cost of weaving and manufacturing has increased, the sales market is restricted by actual sales and financial resources, making it difficult to keep up with the increase. There are still cheap goods due to expire this month, which must be sold later. At the same time, the factory's end-of-month payment is huge, and they are also willing to sell some of their inventory without raising prices temporarily. Therefore, the sales market is relaxed outside and tight inside. Yihua coarse cloth has risen by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece, and the opening price of fine cloth and fine twill is flat. Fine woolen cloth, serge, blue cloth, and cloth for foreign trade are raised by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan per piece. There is still demand for summer silk plain fabric in this street, and the selling price has also risen by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. Current sales are uniquely good for Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants. Transactions included more than 4,000 pieces of dyed cloth, dyed twill, red label, bleached cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. This street imported more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse and fine twill, velvet cloth, and serge. Shenxin Factory opened more than 100 pieces of Fugui fine cloth and fine twill, including 50 pieces that were sold to Kunming.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece</p>
<p>Yesterday, white fine cloth and fine twill in this street rose sharply due to the Northern merchants searching for cash, and the market was uniformly squeezed short. The Longtou and Yangguan brands rose 0.8 to 0.9 yuan per piece. The current market price of Longtou spot goods is 15.3 yuan, and the price for next month's goods must be 15.75 yuan. The sales price of Yanghe fine twill is 14.2 yuan, which is also an increase of 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day. Dongmian Foreign Firm opened 50 packages of Yanghe fine cloth, with a price of 15 yuan. The best transactions of the day were more than 600 packages of spot fine cloth of various brands, which were imported by the Qinhuangdao and Tianjin merchants. Short covering and dyeing sales in Mujie also reached 500 to 600 pieces. Dyed goods, such as Yuanzhi tribute, have risen to 0.45 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Exports</p>

<h3>Food - No Samples of Various Goods; Rice Market Stagnates</h3>
<p>Domestic Rice</p>
<p>The market has already shown a state of stagnation. Except for 700 to 800 packages of Wuhu Jiankai sold for 16 yuan, and 125 packages of Biang Yuan station cars sold for 22 yuan, there were no samples of japonica and indica rice on the market. In this situation, if there is no remedial measure, the rice in the shops will be exhausted in about a week. At that time, the rice supply in Shanghai will inevitably cause panic. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly seek good measures to remedy it. The city's sources: no arrivals from the river, and only 1,300 to 1,400 packages from carriage transportation.</p>
<p>Customer Indica</p>
<p>Yesterday's market still used Bomi rice as the authentic transaction. Retailers and local merchants in this street continued to handle it. The total market traded 3,000 packages of coarse Bom and Jueji indica rice. Because of the strict enforcement of the price limit, the market price still did not differ much from the previous market. However, according to grain merchants, there is still effort in progress to lift the ban on Wumi, or it may be announced and implemented on the first of next month.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were few in and out. The market only opened 300 to 400 packages of New Saigon, and the market price has been stabilized, still opening at 25.5 yuan. As for the continued order of foreign rice, it is the only important plan in the current reduction of inventory. It is heard that rice merchants are in consultation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Dutch Red Opens More Than 6,000 Packages</h3>

The Chibli silk, made by New York City brand, opened at 2,000 yuan, and the other six silk filatures have risen to 1,800 yuan, which is a daily change.

Therefore, Yokohama silk prices fell back, with spot prices falling 30 yuan and long-term prices falling 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Cloud Ear Fungus and Peach Kernels Rising Steadily; New Dates Available</h3>
<p>Cloud Ear Fungus: Recently, the source has been obstructed again, coupled with high premium costs, leading to a sharp increase. A new batch of goods has been released, with prices rising by more than thirty yuan, settling at two hundred and fifty-two yuan. Market prices have increased accordingly, but the market remains tight, with an upward trend expected.</p>
<p>Peach Kernels: Cold-stored Tianjin peach kernels have seen prices soar recently due to strong demand. Tianjin peach kernels have risen to one hundred and ten yuan (paper currency), more than forty yuan higher than at the end of last month. Tiger skin peaches are at seventy-five yuan, also up more than twenty yuan. The tight trend has not weakened, and further increases are expected. Walnut prices have increased less significantly, with hand-picked peaches at fifty-five yuan, Dongchang peaches at forty-four yuan, and southern peaches at thirty to thirty-one yuan.</p>
<p>Dates: The first batch of Suzhou dates has already appeared on the market. Five pieces have arrived. Due to the long-term shortage of old goods, they are selling exceptionally well. The price of *tutou* dates has risen to eighty-five yuan. It is reported that Jiaxing dates will also be available soon, and the market is very tight.</p>
<h3>Coal: Henan Shortage; Door-Front Shops Switch to Selling Haifeng Coal</h3>
<p>Henan white coal has not been available since the war due to transportation disruptions in the production areas. The city's sales have relied on pre-war stocks to survive. Recently, as the bottom stock is about to run out and the sales market is booming, supply is falling short of demand, and a sense of urgency is growing. Suppliers are taking advantage of the scarcity of goods. Coal traders are asking for seventy-five yuan per ton for bulk coal, but there are no large batches of warehouse receipts available. Therefore, the door-front shops on this street have had to change course and switch to selling Xunfeng white coal, but the cost is relatively high, requiring seventy-seven yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Import and Export</h3>

<h3>Except for Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou Banknotes, All Local Legal Tender is Generally Accepted; Banks and Money Shops Do Not Refuse to Use Them; Bank of Communications Banknotes Are Fully Usable</h3>
<p>After the Chinese government made every effort to maintain the value of legal tender, the legal tender reserves remained sufficient, with cash accounting for more than 60%, which was deeply trusted by the people of the whole country and friendly countries. In order to prevent speculation and encourage capital inflow into the interior, two regulations on the collection and exchange of banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong and Hankou were promulgated. After that, the exchange craze in Shanghai subsided, and the remittance into the interior surged. New Life News reporters learned from the banking sector yesterday that, regarding</p>
<p>Banknotes from Other Places, except for those from Tianjin, Shandong (including Shandong, Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, etc.) and Hankou, all Shanghai markets accept and use them fully, and banks and money shops do not refuse to accept them. As for Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, Siming, Bank of Communications, Agricultural and Industrial, Agricultural and Commercial, Reclamation and South China and other commercial banks’ banknotes, in addition to those from Tianjin, Shandong and Hankou and the Bank of Communications</p>
<p>being handled in the same way, because the issuing reserves of each bank have long been taken over by the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, they are used in the same way as legal tender. Therefore, those holding banknotes of various commercial banks other than Tianjin, Shandong and Hankou place names can exchange Shanghai place name banknotes from the designated China, Central, and Bank of Communications. In short, in addition to those from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, other place name banknotes can be</p>
<p>fully used, and bondholders should not discriminate against them. However, speculators are devaluing and buying banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou place names. It is hoped that bondholders will not be fooled. According to financial sources, the Huaxing banknotes supported by the Japanese and puppet regimes are mostly distributed in the suburbs of Shanghai, but they can only be forced to be used in the occupied areas and will never have the opportunity to circulate in the isolated island. Residents oppose the use of these notes, and banks have no intention of accepting</p>
<p>or using them at all. In addition, all banks now have strong preparations for storing existing reserves in their vaults. It is hoped that all sectors will no longer lightly believe rumors and inducements and cause unnecessary panic. As for the Shanghai branches of China, Central and Bank of Communications, they are all willing to take on the important responsibility of stabilizing the financial market and will listen to the orders of the Chongqing head office for all calming measures and means. They are determined to break any abnormal rumors from now on.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai and Haimen are Repeatedly Bombed; Japanese Ships Bomb Tongjiao in Fenghua</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, Japanese aircraft once flew to Ningbo for reconnaissance, only distributing absurd leaflets and not dropping bombs. Japanese warships sailed to the waters of Longshan, Xiepu Township, north of Nanhong Town, and fired artillery shells at the shore, firing more than 30 shells in an attempt to cover the Japanese army's landing. The defending Chinese army inflicted a heavy blow on them, and they were eventually forced to retreat. Japanese warships in the waters of Hukoubo, Fenghua Port, also bombarded Tongjiao on the northwest coast, causing aimless harassment. The shells landed in barren fields and caused no damage. The Chinese army in various coastal areas is now on high alert. At 2 p.m. on the 26th, three Japanese aircraft invaded Haimen and dropped five or six bombs, causing very little damage.</p>
<h3>The Nanhua Line is Repeatedly Hit; Qingyuan Sets Sail for Singapore This Morning; Guiyang Will Also Join</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China's coastline has been controlled by the Japanese Navy, and foreign exports have also been obstructed. In the past, such cases have been numerous and reported in newspapers. Since the fall of Guangzhou, foreign ships operating on the Nanhua route have suffered considerable blows, with Jardine Matheson and Taikoo suffering the greatest losses. The two companies have sought new ways to open up the coastal defense route and Guangzhou Bay and Shantou shipping is more prosperous than before. Therefore, the losses from the suspension of shipping in Guangzhou have been recovered. Unexpectedly, Shantou was lost again in late last month, resulting in the severance of the Shanghai-Shantou, Hong Kong-Shantou, and Shantou-to-Nanyang routes. Foreign ships have suffered another blow. Taikoo has changed the Shantou-to-Siam route to a Shanghai-Siam route, and the Suzhou and Zhangjiakou ships have already sailed. The company is also planning to expand to Nanyang and has sent the Qingyuan to test the route to Singapore. Passengers and cargo have been loaded, and it is scheduled to set sail at 8:30 this morning, calling at Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay before sailing directly to Singapore. As for the Zhangjiakou, which previously sailed the Nanyang route from Shantou, it has arrived in Shanghai to operate the Shanghai-Siam route. It is reported that the Guiyang will also arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month to join the new route.</p>
<h3>Shao Shijun Secretly Travels to Japan</h3>
<p>Shao Shijun, with someone supporting him, has been the head of the "Unified Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces" for more than a year. Because of his sophisticated methods and skillful appropriation, he has transformed from a poor scholar into a wealthy man with millions of assets. However, the staff in the "Bureau" follow suit, engaging in corruption and embezzlement, which Shao cannot control, resulting in the internal corruption becoming increasingly serious and corruption cases emerging one after another. The "Reformed Government" was dissatisfied long ago. Now, using this as an excuse, he was forced to resign and be replaced by Yan. Shao was panicked when he heard this. First, he went to Beijing to seek help, and then secretly went to Japan to lobby various parties, intending to cling to his position and continue his desire to plunder.</p>
<h3>Employee Subsidies at the Telephone Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company, in view of the recent high prices of goods and the general suffering of employees, has increased subsidies from July. Salaries above 200 yuan will be increased by 25%, and those above 100 yuan will be increased by 45%. In addition, a few yuan will be added as rice subsidies. However, small employees below 100 yuan will not receive any additional subsidies except for a small amount of rice subsidies, which has caused considerable dissatisfaction within the company.</p>
<h3>Financials Become Active After the United States Revokes the Trade Treaty with Japan; Black Market Foreign Exchange Loosens and Gold Recovers; The Market Generally Believes It is Beneficial to China</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange black market, due to rumors that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee would not maintain it and HSBC Bank restricted supply, the shrinkage of the foreign exchange black market was drastic again yesterday morning. Although the HSBC listing did not change, the British exchange rate was 4 shillings and the US exchange rate was 7.75 yuan, but the actual market price was lower than the previous day. It is estimated that the British exchange rate was 4 shillings 25 cents, and the US exchange rate was 8.215 yuan. Subsequently, because the US State Department announced the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty, and the British Foreign Secretary stated in the House of Commons that the policy toward China had not changed, the Shanghai financial market generally believed that it was beneficial to China. Therefore, the foreign exchange black market loosened, and speculators emerged one after another. As for the gold black market gathering place, the price rose to 3,920 yuan after opening yesterday morning. The morning closing price was 3,950 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 21,865 yuan. The silver shop Dahang yesterday listed it at 405 yuan, and last night it was 390 yuan. The exchange rate spread rose to 260 yuan yesterday morning and then fell back to 230 yuan.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Rice Storage in Firms and Warehouses; Ask Silver and Money Industries to Tighten Rice Mortgages; Jiuda's License Revoked and Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>After the Public Concession’s Public Works Department and the French Concession's Public Works Bureau strictly enforced the price limits on the rice market, it was confirmed that Jiuda Rice Shop at No. 780 Julu Road exceeded the price limits. The manager of the shop, Wang Yusheng (i.e., Wang Youren), who was arrested in the market a few days ago, has been reprimanded by the Market Management Committee and released by the Public Works Department. However, his market entry permit has been revoked and he is prohibited from trading in the market. As for the rice shop, in addition to the French Public Works Bureau sending police to order the sale of all top-quality white rice below the limit price of 210 yuan, the business license was revoked yesterday morning. The shop announced a temporary suspension of business starting yesterday morning. Thorough Investigation and Disposal of Speculation</p>
<p>The rice in the Chinese, Zhejiang Xingye, Bank of Communications, China Industrial, Reclamation, Donglai, and Shanghai banks and warehouses in the Shanghai Concession area is the most. It is reported that in order to prevent hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, the Concession authorities will thoroughly investigate the amount of rice stored in each bank, money shop, and warehouse, as well as the names of the owners, strictly enforce the price limits, crack down on speculation, and advise foreigners not to speculate in rice. It has been learned that the Concession authorities have measures to deal with hoarders and have asked the silver and money industry to tighten rice mortgages to prevent fueling speculation. The rumors about relaxing the rice price limits have been firmly denied by the authorities. Assign Personnel to Supervise and Permit Reporting</p>
<p>The rice market on Fuzhou Road is still supervised daily by supervisors assigned by the Concession authorities. Yesterday, someone reported to the French police that Gongda Xin Rice Shop at No. 95 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession had exceeded the 20 yuan price limit. The Public Works Bureau revoked the shop's business license, and it was not returned until the afternoon. Therefore, the rice shop is still operating as usual, but it is said that it was a misunderstanding, and the business license was returned after the facts were clarified. The Guild Publishes a List of Rice Storage Warehouses</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Guild yesterday released the 17th report on the amount of rice stored in grain warehouses, with a total of 231,337 bags, a decrease of 69,144 bags from the previous period. The Bank of China warehouse has the most, with 36,589 bags, followed by the Zhejiang Xingye warehouse with 35,993 bags, Maotai Warehouse with 24,516 bags, China Industrial Warehouse with 21,476 bags, Longmao Warehouse with 10,884 bags, Xinhua Bank Warehouse with 8,1383 bags, Zikangzhuang Warehouse with 6,0388 bags, Dinghe Warehouse with 5,819 bags, and Zhengfeng Warehouse with 5,069 bags. The Market is Chaotic and Underground Trading is More Rampant</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the market trading was still chaotic, and top-quality rice was nowhere to be found. However, underground trading suddenly became rampant. It is said that those engaged in underground trading use the market to make contact and then go outside to negotiate deals directly, without signing any transaction documents. It is said that the price of top-quality white rice has reached 32.8 yuan, exceeding the price limit by 2.8 yuan. Only glutinous rice and Tianjin rice are traded in the market. As for the firms of the Market Management Committee, there has been no trading since Monday, because they are limited by the ban and refuse underground trading. It is said that the Concession authorities have sent detectives to secretly investigate firms engaged in private underground trading in order to investigate and deal with them. The Source is Sufficient to Regulate</p>
<p>The representatives of the rice industry groups visited Mr. Hede Kui, Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, the day before yesterday. In addition to reporting on the recent sources and rice market trading situation, they also asked for ways to dredge the sources. According to a report by the New News Agency, the rumors that Wuhu, Changzhou, Wuxi and other places are obstructing the export of rice cannot be fully believed, but obstructions along the way are unavoidable. Yesterday, four or five ships from the rice market at the lower Nanbang port arrived, and more than 2,000 bags were loaded by carriage from Ba and Fengjing and other gangs. Fortunately, the new rice season is approaching, and Dongxin japonica rice will be fully available in early next month. Although the rice stored in Shanghai has decreased compared with before, the rice purchased by citizens has increased. Although it is impossible to investigate, it is estimated that there are at least four to five hundred thousand bags, which can regulate the market until September and October without any problems.</p>
<h3>Unified Government Bonds' Discount and Pledge Are Ready; Central Bank Branches Are Waiting for Implementation; Headquarters Orders Should Arrive in Shanghai by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced the payment method for the principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, the customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted. The four banks of China, Central, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank had no choice but to temporarily suspend the payment of the principal and interest of each debt. In order to stabilize the market, the four banks will discount and pledge the first repayment of principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of July. The Chongqing headquarters will pay the full amount at one time, and the Shanghai and other port branches will pay it off in six installments. The Shanghai Central Bank branch has fully printed the discount vouchers and installment pledge payment schedule, and all preparations have been completed. As soon as the official headquarters order arrives in Shanghai, the pledge payment will begin on July 31. It is decided that the relevant order will arrive in Shanghai before the 31st. According to a report by the New Life News Agency to the securities black market, the closing prices of the unified government bonds yesterday morning were 52 yuan for Type A, unchanged; 43.4 yuan for Type B, down 5 cents; 41.8 yuan for Type C, down 5.5 cents; 41 yuan for Type D, down 6 cents; and 41.35 yuan for Type E, down 5.5 cents.</p>
<h3>The Hankou US Consulate Asks About Going to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>To Meet Reverend Hollen in Nanchang The Japanese Army Claims It Will Facilitate It</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that a spokesman for the Japanese army claimed yesterday (the 26th) at a reception for journalists that the Japanese side would facilitate the Hankou US Consulate's visit to Nanchang to meet Reverend Hollen. A Japanese liaison officer visited US Consul General Gauss on Tuesday to discuss the matter and assured Gauss that preparations would be made to facilitate the trip.</p>
<h3>Five People Arrested in Recent Days</h3>
<p>On the 26th, Yu Guoying, Sun Mingjia, Ying Baolin, and Chen Xiaodi were arrested in Yunnan Road in the Public Concession and Beile Road and Fululi Road in the French Concession on suspicion of something. Then, at 11:11 a.m. yesterday, Gong Boqi (32 years old), a resident of Jiangsu Province living in Room 33 of the Dongchang Hotel at No. 5 Wufeng Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was arrested. At that time, special agents of the Japanese side, together with personnel from the Public Concession and French Concession police departments, went there. However, the Japanese side pointed out that the guests in that room were related to the guerrillas, but the police officers searched inside and found no relevant evidence. It was found that Gong lived in that room on the 23rd of this month and lived there with his wife and children.</p>
<h3>Dense Gunfire Near the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway</h3>
<p>According to transportation industry sources, dense gunfire occurred in the western district of Shanghai at about 7 am yesterday. It is rumored that a battle occurred near the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway. The main land routes in western Shanghai, such as Hongqiao Daxi Road, are heavily guarded, and there are very few people coming and going. The public buses between Shanghai and Qingpu have stopped, and the defense at the Beixin Jing ferry is even stricter. All ships and pedestrians are subject to strict inspection. Although the ferry has resumed, there are few passengers.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Responds to Foreigners' Questions All Issues Are Handled Properly Traffic Incidents Are Also Resolved at Meetings</h3>
<p>During the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession this spring, some taxpayers raised several questions. At that time, the Director-General of the Public Works Department replied that the issues raised would be investigated by the Bureau.</p>
<p>Improvements in Traffic Will Be Announced Separately</p>
<p>Among the issues raised, some were related to traffic. These matters, as well as some other traffic issues, were submitted to the Police Committee of the Public Works Department for discussion at a meeting on the 20th of this month. All the motions at this meeting were about traffic matters. As a result of the discussion, the Bureau will issue a separate announcement soon. The Issue of Remuneration for British Agents</p>
<p>Another issue raised by the taxpayers was about the remuneration of the Public Works Department's agents in London. This remuneration is calculated in British gold, so it naturally increases a lot when converted into national currency. The ability to reduce the remuneration required by the Public Works Department's agents in London for performing several important tasks for the Bureau has been considered by the Bureau's Finance Committee. This issue is still under discussion by the Committee.</p>
<p>Publication and Distribution of Official Gazette Will Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The issue of printing and distributing the Public Works Department's Official Gazette has been submitted to a special sub-committee of the Finance Committee for discussion. Its report has been approved by the Board of Directors and will soon be announced to the press. The Amount of Old-Age Pensions Has Been Revised</p>
<p>A taxpayer once questioned why the amount of retirement pensions for retired employees listed in the Public Works Department's budget for this year, when converted into national currency, was less than in previous years. Regarding this issue, the former Director of the Public Works Department submitted a report to the Finance Committee stating that there were some errors in the previous years' pension budgets, namely that the amount of national currency was converted at a fixed exchange rate of one yuan of national currency to one shilling, two pence, and three-eighths of a penny of British gold, instead of the fixed exchange rate of one tael of silver to two shillings and six pence of British gold stipulated in Article 7 of the pension custody agreement. The pension amount table for this year has been revised to comply with the provisions of the custody agreement. As a result, the amount of British gold listed this year, when converted into national currency, is less than in previous years. However, the item for exchange subsidies in the general expenses category has increased. The Director also said that the revision of Article 7 of the custody agreement and the change in the above-mentioned exchange rate (that is, replacing the exchange rate of one tael of silver to two shillings and six pence of British gold with the exchange rate of one yuan of national currency to one shilling, two pence, and three-eighths of a penny of British gold) increased the pension fund by about 300,000 yuan. This expenditure was not included in the original budget. The Director then suggested to the Finance Committee that all pensions calculated in British gold should be marked in future pension budgets as having been converted according to the provisions of the custody agreement at the exchange rate of one tael of silver to two shillings and six pence of British gold. This suggestion has been accepted by the Finance Committee. The Situation in the Western District Has Been Publicly Announced</p>
<p>During the taxpayer's annual meeting, questions were also raised about the situation in the area of roads outside the boundary of the Western District. On May 5 of this year, the Public Works Department issued a public notice, which has been published in various newspapers and will not be repeated here.</p>

<h3>The Pseudo "Municipal Government" Detains Garbage Trucks; The Purpose Is to Coerce; It Wants to Discuss It Together with Other Issues; Fifteen Trucks Have Not Yet Been Returned; Loss Relates the Experience of Being Mistreated</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that Ross and his party from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Department were forcibly taken to Jiangwan by personnel of "Dadao" on Sunday and stayed in a dirty place for 46 hours with a shortage of food and guarded by armed police. After the British Consulate General and the Public Works Department made strong protests, the people have been released yesterday (the 26th). However, the Public Works Department and private trucks worth at least 500,000 yuan are still under the "arrest" of the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government". Among them, the value of 15 new American trucks purchased by the Public Works Department is equal to the amount of arrears that "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an demanded from the Public Works Department for the right to dump garbage in Zhabei. According to Jimson, Director of the Public Works Department yesterday,</p>
<p>Fu's agency is particularly difficult to deal with. It was heard a few weeks ago that the French Concession authorities had difficulty dumping garbage, so the Public Works Department began negotiations with Chuan. However, the "Dadao" personnel wanted to discuss this matter together with other issues so that they could be satisfied and solve the matter. However, they are dealing with the entire event without any good reason, according to him. Acting British Consul General Gibson said yesterday morning that since the people had been released at 9:30, he would not</p>
<p>pursue the protest. According to Ross's statement to reporters yesterday about his detention in Jiangwan, at 2:30 pm on Sunday, he and his party of more than 100 people were dumping garbage from the Public Concession near the 63 Huayuan. A Japanese plane began to circle above. Just as he was suspicious, 30 "Dadao" police officers and an armed Japanese officer arrived in a car, approached with guns, and forced the people to return to the trucks without explanation, saying that they had to go to Jiangwan. At that time,</p>
<p>most of the garbage in the car had not been dumped. When the car crossed the railway line and entered the Concession road, Ross went to the car to discuss with two Japanese Marine Corps sentries, but there was no result. Suddenly, a "Dadao" policeman pushed him back into the truck. Before Hongkou Park, he saw an Indian police officer. Ross jumped out of the car and left a note on the Indian police officer's notebook, then returned to the car. He finally arrived in the city center. After a while, the Chinese workers were forbidden in one room, and Ross, the German Brute, the Russian, and a Chinese supervisor were taken into a smelly room.</p>
<p>Saliva was all over the floor, and six armed police officers were wandering outside the room. An hour later, a senior "Dadao" police officer named Yao ordered three eggs and two plates of vegetables to be sent into the room. At 8:30 pm, he brought four bottles of beer for the people and sent in three dirty, smelly beds, coupled with harassing mosquitoes, they could not sleep peacefully. At 1:30 pm, a Japanese military officer, probably an advisor to "Mayor" Chuan, entered the room and told</p>
<p>the people to dress and prepare to be released. A few minutes later, the Japanese returned to the room and said that because of a guerrilla attack, a curfew had been declared and they would not be released until morning. At about 4 o'clock, the people left the room to get some fresh air. At about 7 o'clock, "Municipal Government" personnel began to arrive, and the people were forbidden in the room all day. At 11:30 am, Ross managed to call the Public Works Department to report the details of the detention and requested that a police car be sent</p>
<p>Food arrived Yao heard the news and ordered people to send in four breads and some milk. Ross told him that he was waiting for the food from the Concession to arrive. Yao sent someone to take back the beer and some dishes as soon as possible by private car. When the two Japanese personnel of the police department arrived with food, Yao asked Ross and others not to accept it, but Ross and others turned a deaf ear. During the detention, the Chinese workers only ate coarse rice, while Ross paid 6 yuan for each meal, and the Chinese workers only had</p>
<p>a little vegetables to fill their stomachs. On Tuesday night, Ross and others got new beds and clean bedding, and were able to sleep. Yesterday morning, they ate the remaining food sent by the Concession. The trucks were parked outside the room. Ross repeatedly asked to dump the smelly garbage in the car for hygiene reasons, but it was unsuccessful. At 11:00 am, Ross and others were released and left on</p>
<p>several moving trucks. They drove to Ditchville Road. One car was damaged and could not move. Ross ordered the party of 103 people to get off the car and go to the Ditchville Road police station, and then returned to the Public Concession to report the details to the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao District in Western Shanghai: Chinese Guerrilla Forces Bolstered, Numbering at Least One Thousand, Not Disturbing Foreign Nationals, Foreign Nationals Even Aiding Guerrilla Forces with Funds—Japanese Army's Inability to Control the Area Clearly Proven—</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, foreigners residing outside the Shanghai Western District concession have received letters in recent weeks, or have had well-dressed Chinese individuals, accompanied by their fifteen-year-old sons, call at their door to request several yuan in funding to assist the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Hongqiao area and to guarantee one year of protection. Foreign nationals in Hongqiao are currently unsure whether these requests are genuine or deceptive. Some believe that the funds are indeed</p>
<p>used to assist the guerrilla forces. According to a foreign national in Hongqiao, speaking to a reporter yesterday (the 26th), they contribute two yuan each month, handed over to the Chinese individual collecting the money. They believe that this money does indeed reach the hands of the guerrilla forces. Although the Japanese army nominally controls the area, only a few Japanese soldiers are seen in daylight, and only a small number of patrolling Japanese soldiers appear at night, often triggering gunfire. Foreign nationals are aware that there are guerrilla forces in the area. Logically, this money must</p>
<p>reach the hands of the guerrilla forces. Other foreign nationals in Hongqiao have said the same. In summary, their statements demonstrate that the Japanese army only nominally controls the area. They also state that, whether the funds are being fraudulently obtained in the name of guerrilla forces, or whether the money is indeed reaching the hands of the guerrilla forces, both reflect the Japanese army's lack of control. It is estimated that there are currently at least one thousand guerrilla fighters active</p>
<p>in the Western Shanghai area. They do not disturb foreign nationals. Gunfire is almost certain to occur at night, either for a short time or continuously for two or three hours. The frequency of gunfire is a fact.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai County Government Carefully Issues Exit Permits</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Foreign Vessels' Whereabouts Mysterious; Arriving at Wenzhou, Unable to Enter</p>
<p>The Zhenhai County Government, due to the increasing number of people going to the county to obtain permits, has formulated the following measures to ensure caution and facilitate issuance: 1. Regardless of gender or age, everyone must provide two 2.5-inch head-and-shoulders photos, along with their identity card, and submit them to the government for verification. 2. Starting from the 22nd of this month, applications will be received and issued in the morning and afternoon, respectively. Only receiving in the morning, not issuing; only issuing in the afternoon, not receiving. Application forms, documents, and photos received on this morning will be issued with a pass at 3 PM on the next afternoon. 3. The elderly and young may have someone submit their application forms and photos on their behalf if the journey is too far, but the pass must be collected in person for verification and issuance. Proxy collection is not allowed. 4. Those who have paid off their field taxes and voluntary defense contributions must still present the receipts for verification when collecting the permit. If field taxes and voluntary defense contributions have not been paid, they should be paid first. 5. The written guarantee deposit should be submitted to the local district office, or office, or police station by the guaranteed person with the completed guarantee letter in advance, and the responsible head officer should be responsible for checking the guarantee and signing and sealing (using a private seal) and then submitting it to the government together with the application form and two 2.5-inch head-and-shoulders photos for verification and issuance of the pass. In addition, if any township has not sent the allotted conscripted laborers since June, that township shall not arbitrarily issue applications, and the county government's exit passes shall also be temporarily withheld until the quota has been conscripted in full, in accordance with the regulations, to emphasize military service and benefit the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Line</p>
<p>After the authorities approved the continued sailing of foreign vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, they were to anchor at the mouth of Zhenhai, outside the sealed line, and passengers and cargo were to be transferred by barge. This information was reported in previous issues. It is now known that the Moller Line's Moufuk (謀福)  Wheel departed from Shanghai to Ningbo this morning. The Yihua Line's Baoli Wheel (寶利輪) has been approved by the authorities to join the Shanghai-Ningbo line, and was originally scheduled to sail this morning. Due to passenger and cargo procedures not being completed in time, it has been rescheduled to sail to Ningbo at 3 AM tomorrow morning. The Moller Line's Haifuk Wheel (海福輸) also intends to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and is currently applying. Once approved, the sailing date will be set. The Far Eastern Company's Hanna Wheel (哈納輪) decided to sail to Ningbo twice. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai last night, but the cargo had not yet been loaded. The company said that it would return to Shanghai on the 29th (Saturday) and continue sailing to Zhenhai on the morning of the 30th. The Sino-Italian Company's Deping Wheel (德平輪), which sailed to Ningbo at the same time as the Hanna Wheel and arrived in Zhenhai at the same time, will not be able to return to Shanghai until next Monday because the ship is larger and carries more cargo.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Line</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson's Shenyuan Wheel (神元輪), which left Shanghai directly for Wenzhou on the 25th. According to a telegram received by the company from the ship, it arrived outside the mouth of Wenzhou at around 5 PM on the 26th. Because the port was sealed, it could not enter. It is unknown whether it will return to Shanghai or change its route.</p>
<h3>British Tax Collectors Temporarily Detained in Western Shanghai: Puppet Regime Denies the Municipal Council's Right to Collect Taxes; Two British Nationals Detained for Five Hours</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, on Tuesday afternoon and evening, while the staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department, including Mr. Ross, were still being detained by the "Great Way Municipal Government" in the city center and had not been released, two British tax collectors from the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Frazer and Mr. Griffiths, were detained for five hours in the "badlands" area of Western Shanghai by the "Great Way" police. It began shortly after 2 PM when the two were collecting taxes at No. 95 Yidingpan Road in the "badlands" area. At 2:15 PM, a group of "Great Way" police approached the two and politely asked them to accompany them to the police station at the end of the alley. The two had no choice but to comply. An hour later, Mr. Frazer and Mr. Griffiths' official car was allowed to return, and the driver was told to report the detention. Upon hearing the news, police officers from the Jing'an Temple police station went to consult with a Japanese consultant from the "Great Way Municipal Government" in the Western District. At 7:15 PM, the two British nationals were released. The reason for the detention was that the "Great Way" authorities did not recognize the Shanghai Municipal Council's right to collect taxes in the alleys next to the roads outside the concession. According to Shanghai Municipal Council personnel speaking to reporters today (the 27th), the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that it should be compensated for providing services, as residents of the alley enjoy the public convenience of using the roads leading to the concession.</p>
<h3>Dual Organization Discovered in Local Privately-Run Radio Stations</h3>
<p>The privately-run Chinese radio stations in this city originally had an organization called the Shanghai Broadcasting Industry Association, for the purpose of mutual contact and business development. Since the August 13th Incident, the Japanese side established the "Shanghai Broadcasting Wireless Supervision Office" in Shanghai, stipulating that all newly established radio stations must first obtain permission from the office, otherwise they would be banned. Before the war, there were more than 30 Chinese radio stations in this city. After the war, some voluntarily ceased operations, but several new radio stations were also established. Therefore, the number of radio stations is currently about the same as before the war, and they all operate by broadcasting commercial programs. It is now heard that, under the guidance of the "Supervision Office," a so-called "Shanghai Private Radio Station Association" has been established, and it is learned that the association held its inaugural meeting on the 22nd of this month. Thus, a dual organization has also emerged in the privately-run radio station industry in this city.</p>
<h3>Hurricanes Active in the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>Two New Typhoons Arise; Movement Still Unclear</p>
<p>Hurricanes have arisen in the Pacific Ocean one after another, which is rare in previous years, because the active season for hurricanes usually starts in the autumn. According to a Reuters reporter, this morning they learned from the Xujiahui Observatory that there are currently two hurricanes rising in the Pacific Ocean. The first hurricane had already reached 29 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude at 6 AM this morning, heading due west. Although Shanghai will not be attacked by this hurricane, the climate has been somewhat disturbed. Therefore, the sun appears and disappears intermittently in this city, and there are occasional rain showers. The second hurricane has just begun. At 6 AM this morning, it reached 22 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, heading northwest. It is still unclear whether Shanghai will be affected by it. As for the hurricane that arose in the Pacific Ocean on the 24th of this month, it landed and dissipated after reaching 29 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude, near Wenzhou and Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Changshu Repeatedly Attacked</h3>
<p>On the 24th of this month, the guerrilla unit led by Zong Bolian, which is active in the Xihu (錫滬) Highway area of Changshu, has been trained and equipped since being assigned by the Eastern War Zone military authorities. On the night of the 24th, at about 8 PM, he led more than 80 team members to sneak into the Changshu section of the Xihu Highway. The highway is used by the Japanese army as an important military transportation route. The guerrillas have been constantly carrying out sabotage on the road in recent weeks. The Japanese army repairs it and then it is broken again, unable to maintain it. They dispatched more than 200 Japanese soldiers to patrol and guard the Baimao Gu area of the road all day long, but the guerrillas appear and disappear unpredictably, and the Japanese army cannot stop them. Therefore, at about 5 AM on the 25th, they attacked and destroyed four military vehicles and one commercial vehicle from Shanghai to Wuxi near the No. 62 Foreign Bridge, killing more than 50 Japanese soldiers and seizing 374 new-style rifles, 21 Type 38 light machine guns, two steel cannons, 126 boxes of ammunition, eight Lee-Enfield rifles, nine pistols worn by the killed Japanese soldiers, 13 Mauser pistols, and two revolvers (six-inch and eight-inch). During the attack, the Japanese army fought back in panic in the east, and were swept by light machine guns. Eleven team members and two squad leaders were also killed. Although the guerrillas also suffered some casualties, their morale was extremely high.</p>
<h3>Qian Industry Clearing Houses Report on Drawing Funds; More Than 30 Reports Received, Only a Few Not Reported; More Than 10 Million Needed for Clearing, Collateral Valued at 70%</h3>
<p>The new clearing system to be implemented by the money industry, with the money industry's 10 million yuan fund for drawing, and the amount of position that each bank plans to draw, has been reported to the association. It is estimated that the 10 million yuan amount for the entire industry will exceed the assumed amount. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drawing Positions: Banks Report Completion</p>
<p>There are 41 members of the money industry, both north and south. Since the association announced on the 25th of this month to consult with each bank on the amount of new clearing funds needed, and limited the time to report within two days from the date of the announcement in order to calculate, the managers of each bank immediately summoned the assistant managers and the people in charge of the business department to carefully discuss the total amount of clearing funds needed for business, and then prepared a report and sent it to the association within the day before yesterday, confirming the amount of position for the assumed amount of clearing to be drawn. The association did not receive many reports from members the day before yesterday. As of yesterday afternoon, the association had received reports from as many as 36 or 37 banks. It is expected that the remaining few banks' reports will be completed this morning.</p>
<p>Need for Clearing Exceeds 10 Million</p>
<p>The money industry assumed that the total amount of new clearing funds to be drawn by the money industry would be 10 million yuan. The association was responsible for announcing to each bank to estimate the amount of clearing funds needed for business. It was rumored in advance that the allocation of funds in the industry would not be enough to reach 10 million yuan. Yesterday, according to the industry spokesperson, the recent business of each clearing bank has been prosperous. Although there are a large number of reserves, the amount of clearing funds to be drawn is also extremely necessary for business. It is found that this amount is only an assumed amount. It is estimated that the total amount of clearing funds to be drawn reported by the association has already exceeded 10 million yuan. In the future, after the new banknotes are implemented, if each bank has a surplus in the amount it has subscribed for, it can also be dismantled among the industry. As for the limit of collateral, whether it is a title deed, securities, jewelry, etc., it will be valued at 70%.</p>
<h3>Disabled and Old People's Home Formulates Admission Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Disabled and Old People's Home, jointly organized by the entertainment industry, etc., has started to take in people after the board of directors of the home elected Zhu Qizhen, Zhang Yichen, and Zhang Ye'er as chairmen, and Ye Nianqu, Quan Baoqing, and Liu Ziyun as directors. The methods are as follows: (1) The home will take in a maximum of 100 disabled people and 50 elderly people (the elderly must belong to the entertainment industry). (2) Disabled people and helpless elderly people must have an introducer report their name, age, native place, family situation, and the reason for the disability to the home. After the home verifies the information and there is room, it will notify the introducer to fill out a guarantee letter and send it to the home for admission.</p>
<h3>Large Gang of Bandits on Trial for Murder, Kidnapping, and Robbery; Defendants Confess to Numerous Crimes</h3>
<p>The bandits Yang Shunkang, Ming Shanxiang, Chen Yuansheng, Jiang Liansheng, Zhang Shaole, Wang Zhongshi, Sun Yaowu, Li Youtai, Chuan Kaihua, and dozens of others, from May 2nd to December 2nd of this year, continuously committed more than 17 cases of kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder in the Public Concession and the road extension areas of Western Shanghai. Recently, the Public Concession's various police stations collaborated to arrest 29 male and female bandits in Wugong, Daxin, Dongfang, and Dachunghua hotels, and in the shacks on Lou Lang Road, and seized military weapons such as handguns, Mauser pistols, and hand grenades, which were brought to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were transferred to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The defendant Yang Shunkang and Ming Shanxiang were prosecuted for attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. The defendants Chen Yuansheng, Jiang Liansheng, Zhang Shaole, Wang Zhongbao, Sun Yaowu, Gao Yunwen, Li Youtai, Chuan Kaihua, and Yang Shunkang were prosecuted for robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Code. The defendant Yang Shunkang was prosecuted for endangering public safety under Article 186 of the Criminal Code. Jiang Liansheng, Sun Yaowu, Zhang Shaole, and Li Youtai were prosecuted for preparing to commit kidnapping for ransom under Article 347, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. Attorney Li Zhishan represented the police station and described the process of solving the case and the criminal facts of each defendant, stating that at 3:35 PM on the 2nd of this month, Western Police No. 83, Chinese Police No. 2989, and Chinese Police No. 2864 dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Police Station were patrolling and searching pedestrians in their jurisdiction. Unexpectedly, the defendants Yang Shunkang and Ming Shanxiang opened fire on the Chinese and Western police at Yidingpan Road, attempting to murder them. The defendants Chen Yuansheng and Zhang Shaole repeatedly committed theft in the concession. Jiang Liansheng, etc.</p>
<p>attempted to kidnap Zhou Baoqing's three-year-old son. All of these acts were confessed to at the police station. However, among the 29 defendants, some committed several crimes, and the most serious ones were prosecuted, while the minor ones were not prosecuted in accordance with Article 233 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Judge Jiang then interrogated each defendant based on the charges. According to the defendant Yang Shunkang's confession, he was a bodyguard at a mansion at No. 6, Lane 95, Yidingpan Road. At 3:35 PM on the 2nd of this month, he and Ming Shanxiang did open fire on the Chinese and Western police. Afterwards, he handed the gun over to Xu Xiongfei. All actions were in accordance</p>
<p>with the orders of the bodyguard captain Xu Wenan. Ming Shanxiang's confession was similar to Yang's. Chen Yuansheng, Li Youtai, Jiang Liansheng, Sun Yaowu, and others confessed to the thefts they committed. However, Chen Yuansheng's sister, Xiang Chen, repeatedly cried out for injustice. The court heard the case from 2 PM to about 5:30 PM. Several witnesses also identified each defendant. Afterwards, police attorney Li and the defense attorneys of the defendants Sun Yaowu and Zhang Shaole, Fan Gang and Zhang Danping, exchanged opinions. The court considered the case to be serious and complex, with many aspects requiring investigation, and declared that all defendants in the case would be remanded in custody pending further trial by a special court.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Parts Prices Increase; Rickshaw Owners Plan to Request Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the increased prices of metal and rickshaw parts, the cost of rickshaws has increased by one-half. Outer tires sold for 19 yuan last month, and now sell for 25 yuan. Inner tires previously sold for 3 yuan, and now sell for 4.5 yuan. Other items such as paint, tarpaulin, and steel wire have also increased across the board. Therefore, the cost per rickshaw, which was 98 yuan in June, has now increased to more than 140 yuan. The rickshaw industry is unable to increase rickshaw rentals due to the restrictions imposed by the Municipal Council. Therefore, at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a general meeting of rickshaw owner representatives was held to ask the director and deputy director generals to be responsible for negotiating, and requested to discuss and resolve the issue based on the reasons for the price increases of trams, rental cars, public buses, and other industries.</p>

<h3>Inciting Abduction; Temple Monk Sued for Receiving Stolen Goods; Each Side Held Their Own Grounds During Yesterday's Trial; Court Ordered to Wait for Verdict</h3>
<p>Yang Yunwu, from Gaoyou, who had served as a county magistrate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces, fled with his family after the "August 13th" Incident and resided at the Leshan Temple on Jin Shenfu Road for more than a year. He has now moved to No. 3, Lane 44, Raul Dong Road. His concubine, Sun Lanzhen, absconded with cash and jewelry worth about 6,000 to 7,000 yuan on May 18th of this year. Yang believed that Sun had an ambiguous relationship with Wan Yuan, a former monk at the Leshan Temple (31 years old this year, secular name Tong Changyao). The monk was significantly involved in this absconding. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, he reported to the French Concession Police Station, ordering detectives to arrest the monk Wan and confiscate stolen goods such as embroidered pillowcases. The police station received instructions to detain the monk for investigation. This has been reported in the newspapers many times. The French police yesterday transferred the monk Wan Yuan to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court, charging him with receiving bribes. Judge Qiu then took the seat and interrogated him. The plaintiff, Yang Yunwu, insisted that his concubine Sun Lanzhen ran away because she was instigated by the defendant monk Wan Yuan, and that the stolen jewelry was also under the defendant's control. The embroidered pillowcase confiscated from the defendant's residence was undoubtedly made by the plaintiff's own daughter, stolen by Sun Lanzhen, and hidden in the defendant's residence. The court then interrogated the defendant based on this, but he flatly denied it. According to the testimony of witnesses Zhang Youfa, Zhu Wanzhang, and others, Sun Lanzhen and the defendant had a very close relationship. The court then ordered that arguments be made and announced the end of the trial, with the verdict scheduled for the 1st of next month.</p>

<p>The Rixin Qianzhuang at No. 9, Fuan Suili, Tianjin Road, was opened by Hu Houfu from Yuyao. At about 11 AM on the 11th of this month, Hu ordered his partner, Kong Guangfu (also known as A Xing, 22 years old), to exchange two clearing bills, with a face value of 4,368 yuan, for 4,000 yuan in cash at the Hangzhou Line No. 48, Jixiang Street. Kong then</p>
<p>fled with the cash. That night, he went to various brothels in the French Concession to have fun. Then, he went to Oriental and Continental hotels and other hotels to solicit prostitutes. In one night, he solicited ten prostitutes to accompany him, spending 150 gold. At the same time, he bought clothes extravagantly. Guan Depei, a Yangzhou native who lived at No. 50 Ximenli, Ximen Road, and Kong met</p>
<p>in the amusement park. After Kong obtained the huge sum of money, he invested 2,000 yuan and rented a room on the upper floor of No. 1 Fushouli, Allegre Road, with Guan to run a usury business. Although Kong was so carefree and happy, the Jiu Xin Zhuang reported to the police station after the incident, and detectives searched everywhere. At 6 AM the day before yesterday, the chief patrol officer Gao Zhen and detective Wang Qi from the General Patrol Police Station</p>
<p>arrested Kong in Room 365, Dajiangnan Hotel, No. 410 Fujian Road, and confiscated 900 yuan of stolen money. Guan Depei was also arrested and 300 yuan of stolen money was also confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested permission for a retrial at a later date because further investigation was needed. The Rixin Zhuang also commissioned Attorney Jiang Chiping to appear in court and filed a civil suit, requesting that the stolen money be returned first. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, it was ordered that the retrial be held one week later and that the stolen money be returned to the owner first.</p>
<h3>Romantic Thief Jiang Jianqiu Sentenced to Nine Years</h3>
<p>The romantic thief Jiang Jianqiu has committed dozens of cases of fraud, theft, and robbery in the two concessions in recent months. Most of the victims are prostitutes, guides, dancers, concubines, and female actors. In May of this year, Jiang was arrested by the Public Concession Police Station and transferred to the First Special Court. He was tried and sentenced to three years imprisonment for repeated theft and three years imprisonment for fraud, to be served concurrently for five years. The French Concession Police Station brought Jiang to justice because Jiang had committed ten cases of fraud and theft and five cases of robbery in the concession. Jiang's confession involved Kunqu actress Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, Yao Yuchan, and wealthy concubine Jin, etc. When Mao Jianqiu appeared in court to confront Jiang, Jiang claimed that he did not know Mao Jianqiu. Yu Guifen and others did not appear in court. The case was concluded by Judge Qiu Huan Ying of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Yesterday morning, he took the seat in Criminal Division 8 and ordered the defendant to be brought to court to announce the verdict. The main text of the judgment stated that Jiang Jianqiu, a repeat offender of robbery, was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. The charges of fraud and theft were dismissed.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having read the Shanghai West news in the third section of your newspaper on the 24th of this month, which stated that the bandit troop of Xu Leisheng was disarmed and resolved, it is not in accordance with the facts. After Zhisheng withdrew from the Guojun West, he was motivated by his enthusiasm for loving the car, organized troops, engaged in guerrilla warfare, disturbed the enemy's rear, was formally incorporated by Shangfeng early on, and appointed to positions. He is by no means comparable to the so-called bandits. Late at night on the 18th of this month, a team of unknown origin did contact bandits to attack the department. Fortunately, the officials and soldiers were unanimously committed to their lives. Therefore, although slightly damaged, it is not difficult to immediately restore the original state. In addition to reporting the details to Shangfeng for instructions and review, I am sending another letter to your newspaper for correction, so as not to confuse the hearing and cause public and private feelings. Respectfully to the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, Xu Leisheng, July 27,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Having read the news item "Charity Lottery Continues to Be Issued" in today's newspaper's local news column, the fact that it was undertaken by our company is true, but there is no person named Ma among our company's shareholders. Moreover, the statement "It is also heard that he has been permitted by a certain party to promote sales in various guerrilla areas, so the confirmed sales amount is still 150,000 yuan" is not only fundamentally unfounded but also damages our company's reputation. Our company's undertaking of the lottery is purely driven by charitable concepts, and there is no intention to profit. How could we dare to do such a frivolous act? It is obvious that others are creating rumors and slandering us. It is hoped that a correction will be made. Respectfully to Shen Bao, Fengxing Company, July 27.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Having read the news item in your newspaper "Pinghu Steamer Attacked by Chinese Troops for Transporting Japanese Supplies," it is not in accordance with the facts. The Shanghai-Pinghu route sailed by our company used a steamer and towed one passenger ship and one cargo ship on the 23rd of this month, fully loaded with goods, heading to Pinghu. At around 6:00 PM that afternoon, when arriving at Xindai, it happened to meet troops passing through. They boarded the ship for inspection and found a transit permit on a passenger, which caused a misunderstanding. The ship was burned and five employees were detained. Our company is currently trying to rescue them. This is the actual situation. Please correct it to avoid misleading rumors. Respectfully to Shen Bao Taijian, Ping He Xing Ji Transportation Company, July 27.</p>
<p>Correction - Regarding the news item "Anti-British Conflict in Hongkou" published in this newspaper on the 25th of this month, after a thorough investigation by this newspaper's reporters, it has been learned that the news was indeed a misreport. We hereby make a correction.</p>

<h3>On Sorrows, Hatreds, Flowers, and the Moon</h3>
<p>— Chiqiang</p>
<p>Looking through old poetry, there are sorrows and hatreds.</p>
<p>New poetry should have saved us from these old ailments, but that is not entirely the case. There are sorrows and hatreds; without hatred, there is no sorrow.</p>
<p>Some say that poets have a different heart. They hate old things, hate them thoroughly, and add new sorrows on top of old ones.</p>
<p>Have you ever weighed how much these sorrows and hatreds weigh? As Li Qingzhao said, "Old hatreds and new sorrows, the Double Creek dragonfly boat cannot bear!"</p>
<p>Double Creek is in my hometown. Dragonfly boats are probably just like those, but not that small. Their carrying capacity and draft are still okay. However, it is said that our poets' sorrows and hatreds cannot be borne. The weight can be imagined!</p>
<p>Sick sorrows and sick hatreds spread across the Chinese poetry and literary scene before an appropriate vaccine was found. If you don't believe it, try humming; those who let you hum will be sure to fall into a city of sorrow and also fall into a sea of hatred. If you want to reach the other shore, to be famous, you must fill the sea of hatred with all the old hatred, "Fill the sea with water until it is dry," isn't it? Embrace all the new sorrows into the city of sorrow, "Retreat from the city of sorrow, ten thousand miles are reduced," isn't it?</p>
<p>Writing poems and composing lyrics is not difficult. What is difficult is to be sorrowful without rules, to hate without enough heat. Your great work is good! Not only empty and without substance, but also unbearably vulgar; to put it expertly, it lacks elegance.</p>
<p>However, without wind there is no elegance, and with wind, flowers bloom and fall. Blooming is natural, "There is a beauty!" Falling petals are, of course, falling. Alas! Pity! Pity! Defects, defects! Immediately, a fever develops. "The crescent moon shines on Kyushu, a few families are happy, a few families are sad"; so, you get angry looking at the moon, from "The moon rises above the willow" until the moon sets and the crow cries. This is called: "Since ancient times, those who have made the moon a source of sorrow, the sorrow will cease when the moon is pushed down."</p>
<p>The moon existed in ancient times, it exists in modern times, and it will continue to be bright in the future. And flowers bloom every year today, and wither tomorrow. Sorrows are endless, and there is hatred within hatred, layers upon layers, new and old, taking up a large page of literature and art.</p>
<p>The "de ma ne ya" sounds are harmless; new poems warm old hatreds, the shadow of the moon on the flowers dappled on the corners of our ancestors' walls, is especially bright tonight, alas! There is no way out, are you still learning to add sorrow and hatred, reaching for the moon and climbing for flowers?</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say. I will copy a poem by Xin Jiaxuan to counter the poison and use it to end the discussion:</p>
<p>When young, I did not know the taste of sorrow, loved to climb the tower, loved to climb the tower, forced to speak of sorrow for new words. Now I know the taste of sorrow, want to speak but stop, want to speak but stop, but say the weather is cool, a good autumn.</p>
<p>A good "The weather is cool, a good autumn"!</p>
<p>Central Plains is disturbed, it is truly a time of national crisis.</p>
<h3>The Book of Truth (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mala</p>
<p>"So everyone rushed to that mountain, opened the book of truth, and recited the sentences in the book in loud tones. Their voices resounded to every corner of the world, telling people that it was possible to live without those oppressors, and that they would certainly be happier and more free. Thus the whole world was enveloped in turmoil and unrest. Terror threatened all nations, and of course the nations with the most oppression were the most afraid. In an attempt to struggle against their ultimate fate, they incited a scruffy officer who had been kicked aside by the people to commit even greater massacres on their behalf."</p>
<p>"This massacre was truly unprecedented. Even the people had not suffered such a fate in the days of the Inquisition and Rivera. They wanted to wipe out the people's heroic struggle in a massacre. They were like a band of crazed magicians. Wherever these magicians passed, bustling cities became ruins. Destruction, death, the innocent blood of peaceful people flowed across the land of this country. Corpses piled up like mountains in the mountain valleys, on the roadsides, and in the villages. The loud voices weakened and finally suffocated in their own blood. Everything was the victory of power." My father said in grief, as if waking up from a long dream. He wanted to take a puff of his pipe, but it was extinguished. He added resolutely: "My story ends like this."</p>
<p>"It shouldn't end like this," I said loudly, suppressing my grief. My heart was twisted by it.</p>
<p>"Yes, my child, the victory of violence is only an illusion. I can tell you for sure that the third tragedy is still being prepared. We must believe in the future," my father said calmly and firmly.</p>
<p>Wanting to calm my heart, I turned my head away, wanting to forget the sad ending of the story filled with deep despair. In the distance, on the horizon, I suddenly discovered a few sparse stars shining like golden buttons. The moon also peeked out from the clouds, pouring clear moonlight into the forest, and a few colorful clouds floated slowly beside it.</p>
<p>"Father, there are stars over there," I exclaimed with joy, pointing at them.</p>
<p>"Yes, I see them. I always feel that light is everywhere. Even my story still implies great hope, still shining future light and warmth," my father said forgetfully, stirring his rich, springy hair.</p>
<p>"It's getting cool, let's go to sleep." My father's excitement had subsided.</p>
<p>That night I had a dream in which the whole panorama of the great tragedy of the people of that country fighting for freedom and happiness unfolded.</p>
<p>I dedicate this article to Mr. Gan, who knows Spain best. He warmed my heart during my days of doubt and depravity, giving me new energy to continue living. I wish him good health from afar.</p>

<p>It was a time long past. The earth was still growing happily. At that time, it was simple, yet it had a primal beauty.</p>
<p>In its youth, the undulating mountains, winding rivers, boundless seas, vast plains, lush trees, colorful flowers, giant beasts, clever birds, chirping insects... adorned it in a very pure way.</p>
<p>At that time, it had the tenderness of a virgin, like a flower bud, and was filled with infinite vitality throughout the universe.</p>
<p>The earth grew quietly in peaceful days, without loneliness. When all living things came to the end of their lives in old age, new beauties immediately replaced them. There was never any decline, nor any lack.</p>
<p>Gradually, the earth evolved, and intelligent humans were multiplying. This made it even more excited. It entrusted its entire life to mankind, who would exhaust their rich brains, use their strong limbs, dig up underground treasures, and develop barren land, to adorn the earth with splendor and beauty.</p>
<p>But the souls of these humans had great disparities: loyal, sincere... cunning, deceitful... Therefore, disputes, struggles... replaced their careers. They no longer worked hard to make the earth beautiful, to create a happy world!</p>
<p>They forgot that only the earth could sustain them. They did not know how to remedy things. The ashes of fire, the traces of bloodshed, the lethal weapons, the clumsy schemes... tainted the earth. The earth lost its innocence and its pure beauty. And those hideous demons and despicable ghosts used the lovely earth as their nests.</p>
<p>The slaughter of the violent, the intimidation of the mighty, the howling of ghosts, the weeping of the oppressed, destroyed all the beauty of the earth!</p>
<p>On earth, there was decline, chaos, gusts of wind, bursts of storms!</p>
<p>Mankind embarked on a path of destruction, and at the same time, they destroyed the beautiful earth!</p>
<p>The earth could not cry, nor could it be angry, but only sighed quietly. It sighed for mankind! At the same time, it sighed for its own fate!</p>
<p>It waited for mankind to wake up, hoping to drive away the ghosts wearing human-shaped masks, so that it could shine again with the brilliance of its youth.</p>
<p>But at present, it is still a sad sight.</p>
<p>Unceasingly, unceasingly, the earth is sighing.</p>
<h3>Inextricably Entangled!</h3>
<h3>I Gaze at the Clouds and Trees in the Distant Sky</h3>
<p>— Guo Nidi</p>
<p>I have returned from a city thirty miles away,</p>
<p>Where I spent my long months and years:</p>
<p>In the dusk, on the streets, by the beautifully decorated shop windows,</p>
<p>My lonely and desolate shadow often lingered.</p>
<p>Now, there are vexing winds and rains every day,</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of the wind sweeping past the treetops outside the window like a sea wave:</p>
<p>Let the sound of the rain gently knock on my closed door,</p>
<p>Having just arrived at my old home, everything feels strange and interesting,</p>
<p>I am originally as bland as a wild monk.</p>
<p>The monotonous music of the chirping insects no longer evokes joy,</p>
<p>My childhood companions have also gradually aged in the dust.</p>
<p>What is more, the stars here have also changed their colors:</p>
<p>I dare not go to the market,</p>
<p>Because I hate seeing all the strange things in the market.</p>
<p>Although I am uneasy with loneliness, I fear</p>
<p>That germs will slowly grow in my blood cells!</p>
<p>I need to breathe some of the moist air of the countryside,</p>
<p>The noise of the noisy carriages and horses is unbearable.</p>
<p>Oh, at this moment, I only hope that tomorrow will be sunny,</p>
<p>To wake up early and hear the cooing of the pigeons,</p>
<p>To spend some time on the tender yellow path after the rain.</p>
<p>Isn't it true, "Germs are more likely to age in the sunlight?"</p>
<p>Then I will gaze at the clouds and trees in the distant sky,</p>
<p>And my heart will fly to a place even further away.</p>
<h3>Eavesdrops</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Life and Death</p>
<p>One day, walking into the cemetery, my friend said, "I want to die." His eyes were fixed on the white cross, perhaps it was the goddess? In the past, my friend lived in an unfavorable environment, reading those books with the fragrance of death—they taught young people some strange ideas.</p>
<p>Hearing this, I said in surprise, "Lying here quietly, aren't you afraid of being lonely?"</p>
<p>"Look, aren't there so many companions?" He pointed to the tombs underground, widening his round eyes.</p>
<p>"But, this is a shameful escape!"</p>
<p>He was silent, his head drooping.</p>
<p>Indeed, "Life is like a burden, some pick it up, some cannot." Now, we are walking on a painful road again, a little tired maybe, but not to the point of falling down. Cheer up, switch shoulders, we still have to go on, we still have to live on.</p>
<p>"Death is not difficult, but we have to consider how to die. We should always have love and attachment to life."</p>

<p>Random Notes of an Artist</p>
<h3>Past and Present (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yin</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Wang Yin has always been known in the film industry for his "hard-line" style. He has been working hard for the Chinese film industry for nearly ten years. Recently, he started trying directing as an actor, and is currently filming "Desperate Fugitive." From this piece of writing, we can see that he is a thoughtful artist.</p>
<p>Since entering the film industry, it has been nearly ten years, and I am ashamed to say that in these long years, I have not seized the opportunities that so many people longed for to develop my ambitions; although I often played important roles that suited my personality, I have never contributed any better achievements to the audience, which is what I regret most.</p>
<p>My initial motivation for joining the film industry was half out of interest and half for the sake of life. There is no need to deny this. At that time—the early days of the rise of the Chinese film industry—many people thought that "making movies" was a novel and good profession. My family became increasingly difficult after my father lost his job, so I got the opportunity to enter this silver screen world. My heart was unusually active, and I was working hard with infinite excitement. At the same time, the outside world's enthusiasm for the film industry also engraved a strong belief in my heart: I am ready to use all my strength to create.</p>
<p>The birthplace of my life on the film set was China Southern Film Company. I remember that the first film was with the "late" Ms. Ye Juanjuan. I was only a supporting actor, playing an insignificant role in the film, a so-called "extra." My performance showed my clumsiness and rigidity everywhere. Fortunately, several colleagues in China Southern were able to guide me wholeheartedly and encourage me at any time. This allowed me to barely finish filming my role. Until the film was screened, I was both happy and apprehensive, but this after all laid the foundation for my nearly ten years of life as a filmmaker.</p>
<p>I muddled along in China Southern Company for two years, but only acted in two or three films. Later, thanks to the introduction of the famous photographer Mr. Hong Weilie, I entered Shanghai Film Company. At that time, because of the lack of actors in Shanghai Company, I was fortunate to be selected by Mr. Du Yu as the leading actor, and successively acted in several films such as "Tales of the Orient," "Hate of a Fallen Woman," and "Beautiful Island." At that time, my "stage name" was "Wang Chunyuan."</p>
<p>Most of the films I starred in at Shanghai Company were martial arts and action films. At that time, the style of film tended towards this aspect, so this type of work was very popular with the audience. In that period, there was absolutely no talk of any "consciousness," so I also blindly followed suit, and worked vigorously on the film set doing fighting work.</p>
<h3>Big King, Second King - A Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness (4)</h3>
<p>— Uncle Fei</p>
<p>—Fifth of Rambling Recollections by the Plum Tree—</p>
<p>This story is finished, and it could have ended here. But I have a slight feeling about this, I wonder if the editor will allow me to finish my words? (Ancient writing style, after recording events, a brief commentary is added to conclude. Like Wei Bing's collection of essays, Uncle Wei's Diary, I might as well copy the sages and have a Li Uncle say:)</p>
<p>The dispute between Zhu and Xu was originally a kind of unconscious venting of anger, which is not worth discussing. But they did not want others to know, and they had a spirit of hard work. Often when they were discovered by colleagues backstage, when the Black Pool Dragon was found, they sighed at each other, expressing disappointment! Because they were not able to implement their original intention, to decide the winner, this is indeed a great regret in the world! It is also normal for a third party to come out to mediate, and there was no pressure to make them comply. At the same time, the two people did not lose face, and they could avoid the harm of both sides being injured. Although later there was a distinction between the Big King and the Second King, this is a factual issue of the past, and it seems that there is no need to care. From now on, when colleagues call Zhu Xiangquan, they all call him Second King instead of his name, and Zhu does not think it is a disgrace. If the third party wants one party to apologize to the other party, or even ask him to take out medical expenses to give to the other party, then this is a humiliating peace! I think the two of them would definitely not accept it, and would definitely go back to fighting! So I think there are too many ways to make peace, there is "glorious peace," there is "shameful peace," and there is "neither glorious nor shameful peace." "Glorious peace" is the peace of victory, "shameful peace" is the peace of defeat; "neither glorious nor shameful peace" is like the peace of Zhu and Xu. Human psychology, of course, wants to take "obtaining glorious peace" as the best policy. The late teacher Nantong Zhang Jian once said: "Since ancient times, domestic and foreign conflicts have only two strategies, war and peace. Peace takes the current peace, and war is a comprehensive plan for the overall situation. To make peace for the sake of peace, is to say that the argument of ceasing war comes from me, then I am weak and he is strong; to make war for the sake of peace, so that the request for peace comes from him, then he is weak and I stretch." How wise is this saying! It is truly an unchanging principle. After writing the Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness, I suddenly had some feelings, and I added a few words to the end of the article, feeling that I was too verbose! Readers, please don't be surprised! (End)</p>
<h3>Fan Xuepeng Will Rejoin Green Jewel</h3>
<p>— Yu Di</p>
<p>The leading actress of the Green Jewel Theater was formerly Fan Xuepeng. She went from the silver screen to the stage of spoken drama, and naturally she was deeply welcomed by the audience. Unfortunately, Fan's physique was weak, and she could not bear the burden of performing on stage day and night. After a doctor's diagnosis, she was said to have lung disease, so she was so frightened that she repeatedly resigned from Green Jewel. After Fan Xuepeng left, Green Jewel "specially invited Zhu Qiuhen to fill the vacancy, but Zhu Qiuhen could not cope, and her appeal was not enough, so she changed to invite the current Wang Xueyan to take over.</p>
<p>After several months of rest, not long ago, Fan Xuepeng went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road to use X-rays to examine her lungs. As a result, it was found that her lung lobes were undamaged, which proved that Fan Xuepeng did not have lung disease! When the Green Jewel authorities received this news, they sent someone to visit and invite her, asking Fan Xuepeng to return to Green Jewel. It is said that she has agreed to the request. If the conditions are negotiated, she may be on stage at Green Jewel from August 1.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Various Opera Troupes in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Although there are many opera troupes in the old capital, except for Fuliancheng, the Opera School, and Rongchunshe, the others are insignificant. The following describes the recent developments of the three troupes, to inform those who are concerned.</p>
<p>(1) Fuliancheng Society: Fulianshe, with Ye Shengzhang as the center, suffered heatstroke while performing the play Ouyang De at the Jixiang Theater on the 4th of the month, so he did not perform for many days, and the plays were performed by Huang Yuanqing and others. The rising martial arts students have neat roles and great progress in art. Recently, it was heard that the president of the society, Ye Wenfu, said that he would discuss with the martial arts professor Wang Lianping to rehearse the entire "Three Heroes and Five Gallants." This play is the old collection of the society's Xiaorongchun troupe. From Bai Yutang searching for the imperial cat and the five heroes seeing him off, to capturing Bai Yutang at Dulong Bridge, it is original and different from others. Once the entire cast is selected, they will start rehearsing and premiere at the Huale Theater.</p>
<p>(2) Opera School: Recently, the school authorities announced the academic achievements of the students in the past year. Hou Yulan was the first in Qingyi, Li Hehui was the first in Laosheng, Wang Jinlu was the first in Wusheng, Li Jinquan was the first in Laodan, Yuan Jinmian was the first in Wujing. Hou Yulan alone occupied the top spot in the overall score, and Wang Jinlu was the runner-up. Also, this autumn is the 15th anniversary of the school's founding, and it is also the day when Wang Jinlu, Li He, Zeng Wang Helin and others graduate, so it was decided to hold a grand founding anniversary and graduation ceremony on that day.</p>
<p>(3) Rongchunshe: Rongchunshe focuses on rehearsing original plays and old plays, and has performed many of them one after another. Recently, there is a play "Five Righteous Ones" that can be performed. Shang Xiaoyun gave the role of the Pipa Fairy to Sun Ronghui, Cai Ronggui gave the entire Catch and Release to Xu Rongkui, and in addition, there is the entire Stab Bajie, with Shang Changchun playing Luo Hongxun, Sun Ruichun playing Hu Li, and Tian Rongfen playing Bajiu's wife. These three good plays have all been rehearsed skillfully and will be performed one after another, to give the people of the old capital the limit of happiness.</p>
<h3>Yi Hua Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Diao Banhu's posture is beautiful. Two months ago, Yi Hua Propaganda made every effort to produce the costume film "Wang Baochuan." At that time, there was a battle between Wang Yang and Gu Han for the role of Princess Daizhan. Yi Hua was difficult to deal with, so she changed to Diao Banhu. According to Wu Cun, the director of the film, Diao's role as Princess Daizhan is extremely beautiful. Diao's facial contours are very suitable for the costumes of this role, and she is also very heroic.</p>
<p>Ning Xuan has a lot of gimmicks. Miss Ning Xuan, plays amateur and makes movies, then movies and dances, then dances and plays amateur, and then returns to the silver screen from the amateur world. In recent years, she has been changing in cycles, which shows that this lady is very active. Miss Ning is originally from the South, but she has lived in Beiping since she was a child, so she speaks very beautiful Mandarin. This time, Chen Kengran, the director of "Women's Apartment," specially invited her to play a very important role as "Wang Refang." "Women's Apartment" started filming with her scene. Miss Ning's years of experience have indeed made her acting skills improve rapidly. Everyone says "Ning Xuan is really promising."</p>
<p>Lan Lan appears on the silver screen. Those who have seen the stage play "Women's Apartment" are very satisfied with Miss Lan Lan, who plays Chen Peipei. The standard Chen Peipei finally appeared on the silver screen. Miss Lan Lan, for the sake of the beauty of the lens, did not hesitate to endure the pain of flesh and blood, and cut her eyelids to make them double eyelids, which is particularly charming. When the film "Women's Apartment" is released, it is expected that many movie fans will be captivated by Chen Peipei on the silver screen.</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Edited by Bao Zibo, Revised by Lu Chengzu</p>
<p>Opening Method - Fifty-fifth Game</p>
<p>Black First</p>
<p>Move according to the previous game</p>
<p>Rook 9 to 6　Elephant 3 advances 5　Rook 6 advances 5　Pawn 3 advances 1</p>
<p>Explanation: It should be connected with cannon first, then the chariot is activated. Whether using horizontal chariot or straight chariot, each has its own advantages. However, straight chariot seems to be slightly better, like Shaolin and Wudang in boxing. From cannon 2 to 5 to pawn 7 advances 1, the black side still does not advance the chariot, which is a missed opportunity, resulting in the red side cannon 8 advances 4 pressing the chariot.</p>
<p>From Rook 9 to 6 to pawn 3 advances 1, at this time, the black side loses the spirit of connection, while the red side's pieces are active. The reason for this is entirely due to the loss of the chariot chance.</p>
<p>Chess News: The Hualian Tongle Association at No. 194 Nanjing Road initiated the Hualian Cup Amateur Team Chess Championship. Registration has begun and will close on the 27th of August. The competition will begin on the 19th of September. It is hoped that all chess teams will actively participate.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Meaning of the Ten-Minute Break Before the Final Play</p>
<p>According to the old rules of the Pear Garden, it is not allowed to "cut the gong" in the middle of the play. "Cutting the gong" is the opposite of "opening the gong." Although the scene in the middle of the play is mainly dominated by the drum, which is like the life of the three armies, the rules of the opera troupe have always been to say open the gong instead of opening the drum when the play starts. For example, a certain role is the first play of the opening, or the first three plays before the opening of the gong. This is all that is usually said. As for the end of each day's play, it was previously said that a certain garden had already cut the gong, but now it is all changed to "stop." In theory, both the big gong and the small gong are important instruments to support the action. During the performance of martial arts plays, when the two armies are facing each other and holding up knives and guns, at this time, the sound of the big gong is used to inspire the spirit of the actors and the audience. Even in literary plays, the steps and movements of the sheng, dan, and chou roles when they enter the scene, as well as the literati's posture and expression, cannot make people feel relaxed and happy without the sound of the small gong. Therefore, in the past, each garden was very cautious when allocating plays. After a loud and deafening martial arts play, it was always followed by a funny skit. As soon as the loud sound of the gong and drum stopped, the sound of the small gong immediately followed, like a violent storm followed by a slight sunshine, revealing a faint blue sky, and the cool breeze was really comfortable. The turbid air that had been suffocating in the heart for a long time could also be completely exhaled at this time. The power of the big gong and the small gong to shift the movement on the stage and the audience's attention is so great, so the name "opening the gong" has its own reason when it was first proposed. Furthermore, such as the "gong and drum sutra" that people in the scene are familiar with, and the insiders often say what kind of gong and drum should be played in a certain place in a certain play, this "starting the gong and drum" also has the word gong at the beginning, which is probably another clear proof that the opening play should be called the opening gong play.

<h3>Prefect Rong Shaves His Head and Hires a Beautiful Woman</h3>
<p>Prefect Rong Hong, who was sent to the United States to supervise the affairs of the foreign affairs bureau, recently heard that he married an American woman named Keller as his wife, and immediately changed his clothes and shaved his hair, intending to live in the United States for a long time and not return to his ancestral land. Lord Li Xiang knew about his hiring of a wife and was also very happy! Alas, how strange! If the students studying in the United States follow his example, they will drive the Chinese people to become Americans. However, there must be a deep meaning in this matter, which outsiders cannot know. The matter of shaving one's hair and changing one's clothes cannot but startle those who hear about it! This time, he was forced to change, and his heart was nothing more than a plan to please his wife. Nowadays, people love the people in their room, and they will naturally follow their wishes in everything, and especially this braid, which is like a wart, should be hated by the emotional woman, and there is a situation where it has to be cut off.</p>
<h3>Three Wonderful Couplets</h3>
<p>(1) A certain family in Hangzhou has a huge area at the gate, saying: "Grandfather, son, father, brother, uncle, nephew, the home of the Hanlin." A well-meaning person continued: "But the person in the middle is not involved." And he wrote a couplet saying: "Eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, swaggering and cheating, bad seeds do everything, only Yu Jizi is capable of it." (2) The Dragon God Temple in Zhejiang Province has a couplet saying: "Flying in the sky, seeing in the fields, changes show functions, rampant in summer." "Slowly clouds, abundant rain, Yin and Yang support changes in theory, and there is also autumn." (3) In the Guangxu Yewei year, a certain government office in Henan Province congratulated the Emperor's longevity couplet: "Taiyun experiences six symbols, driving six dragons, leading the six palaces in the inner six palaces, the six ministers outside, the six residences, coordinating the six laws and six concordances of the Tai Chang, and celebrating the empress dowager's 60th birthday." "Kunyi becomes ten numbers, and the ten emblems are sublime, combining the ten records of heaven, the ten poles of earth, and the ten ethics of man, celebrating the festival on the tenth day of the tenth month, and respectfully meeting the sacred master for ten or five years."</p>
<h3>Rain Grain</h3>
<p>In the local area of Xinghua Prefecture, Fujian Province, there has recently been a rain of grain. The husks of the grain are no different from those taken from the fields, but when the rice grains are peeled off from them, they are sometimes green, black, or other colors.</p>

<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>— Lu Si</p>
<p>Directing a play, this is the second time. The first time was a disastrous defeat. I am really worried that I will not be able to do it and repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>One morning two weeks ago, Mr. Tan, the person in charge of the Baolian Theater Troupe, came to me in the wind and rain through the introduction of Mr. Jin Xin, asking me to direct Mr. Shen You's "Before Sunrise" for them.</p>
<p>At that time, the fate of Chekhov's "The Seagull" immediately came to my mind: the unprecedented disastrous defeat of the first decision in St. Petersburg, and the unprecedented success of the performance at the Moscow Art Academy. The same script, but the performance results of the two times were so different. This shows how important the director's understanding of the script is, and his artistic and political accomplishments can determine the life and death of the play and affect the success or failure of the play's performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, I politely declined. I doubt my artistic cultivation, and I don't trust my understanding of the script. I am afraid that I will invisibly become an executioner and kill the life of Mr. Shen You's script.</p>
<p>However, they did not allow me to decline. They said that this decision was a "charity performance," and the position of director should be a matter of honor.</p>
<p>Under the premise of "directing a charity sale," I silently agreed. But my heart became as heavy as lead again. I thought: To rush out a four-act play in just twelve days, I always felt that it was a loss of artistic dignity. However, this was also inevitable, because the charity performance could not be postponed because of Baolian's "Before Sunrise." Therefore, during the entire ten days of rehearsals, I felt extremely painful, and the inner conflict between "art" and "relief" was strongly tormented.</p>
<p>Now it's good, and my mood has returned to peace. Thanks to the actors' intelligence and hard work, I finally removed a big stone that had been pressing on my heart for a long time, and I can breathe a sigh of relief comfortably.</p>
<p>"Before Sunrise" was written by Mr. Shen You two years ago out of "inspiration." However, today, things have changed. As Mr. Shen You himself said: "The time and environment in which this play was written are very different from the present." Therefore, to put this play on today's stage, the objects of exposure and satire by Mr. Shen You must be greatly shifted.</p>
<p>I should thank Mr. Shen You for allowing me to change his masterpiece as much as possible; at the same time, I should also express my deep apologies to Mr. Shen You, because I really made some bold changes to his masterpiece.</p>
<p>I believe that in the feudal environment of a large family like Huang Weiren, the tragedy predicted by the playwright Shen You will inevitably occur, and the main factor that creates the tragedy of Daozhong is undoubtedly the old and unreasonable social relationship; and all the conflicts and struggles here are also without objection, and are entirely produced by the outdated large family system.</p>
<p>Therefore, I give a different interpretation to the theme of "Before Sunrise." I only regard "Before Sunrise" as a true picture of the collapse of the large family system.</p>
<p>Based on this point of view, I made the eldest young mistress and the third brother Huang Weilian even more opposed to each other, and strengthened the struggle between them, which is the struggle between the new and the old.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I directed this play, I did not regard "Before Sunrise" as a tragedy, but as a tragicomedy.——I particularly emphasized the end of this play. Although three people are dead on the stage, I do not allow the audience to come back with sadness. I want them to smile with tears, go back with a new hope, and I want them to feel a new strength to go back!</p>
<p>Although I say so sharply, I dare not say what the effect of the performance will be. I hope my friends can give me some serious criticism.</p>
<h3>Appeal from Graduating Students in the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>— Sincerely submitted by students in the occupied areas</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I was studying in Beiping in the past year. After graduating from middle school this summer, I came to Shanghai with full enthusiasm, hoping to take the national university entrance examination. If I could be admitted, I could temporarily eliminate all the pain I had felt in the occupied areas in the past, wouldn't that be very happy. So I paid attention to the joint examination registration and enrollment advertisements every day. The day before yesterday, I saw that the joint examination was scheduled, so of course I stepped up my preparations, but what I never dreamed of was that the staff at the registration office looked at my diploma and said: "This diploma says Beijing and cannot take the examination. If an exception is made, it would seem to recognize the puppet government, so the Education Bureau does not recognize this type of graduation certificate unless you get another valid diploma." This is like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and a basin of cold water has been poured on my full enthusiasm. It is also said: "This issue will be decided after the authorities have a meeting." This sentence is nothing more than a comfort, so as not to make me despair. Therefore, I, Minren, feel that the issue of not being allowed to take the examination really has two points that need to be discussed:</p>
<p>(1) In order to adapt to the environment, the people who run education in the occupied area—Beiping—have had to change Beiping to Beijing. This was originally a matter of force majeure. It is by no means what the people who run education are willing to do. If they insist on not changing, the school will inevitably close. Students with ample financial resources can indeed find ways to study abroad, so there is no problem. Then how will another group of students from poor families solve it? At that time, the education authorities did not seem to pay attention to this point, so there was no appropriate remedy. Therefore, we students continued to complete our middle school studies as before. Who would have thought that we would have the distress of not being allowed to take the examination today.</p>
<p>(2) Because the students in the occupied areas cannot bear all kinds of insults, they are very willing to go to the interior to study. But now they are not allowed to stay. Under this situation, we will inevitably be called back to the tiger's mouth to spend the rest of our lives. This method is probably not what everyone wants.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the above two points of view, the education authorities should best formulate an appropriate resolution under the principle of not spending too much money and time, so as to avoid us, the students in the occupied areas, from going back to live a life of tears!</p>
<p>There must be many people like me who have suffered depression, so I boldly ask your column to grant publication, so as to attract the attention of the education authorities, and I will be very grateful.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Xinru's Calligraphy</h3>
<h3>Biographical Sketches of Female Ballad Singers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>As for Pei Lan's later years, Volume 2 of "Seashore Beauties" has a record, saying: "In the summer of Gengchen (1880), she was appreciated by a certain county magistrate's son, and a song Seeking the Phoenix became a marriage bond. Not long after, the son died of diabetes. The brocade quilt was empty and fragrant, and the mandarin ducks guarded alone. It is heard that the prostitute has advised her to cut off all ties with the world, and will use a hundred and eight mani beads to end her life." Pei Lan's later fate was also very sad. This was the female ballad singer who was known for her charity at the time. In terms of talent, there was Cheng Daixiang. Volume 1 of "Dream Shadows":</p>
<p>There is a female ballad singer in Shanghai named Cheng Daixiang, who is quite famous for her ability to write poetry, and she is especially infatuated. She once boasted that she wanted to have both Daiyu and Xiangjun, so she used it as her name. In the Xiang Pavilion, there is a painting of Feng Xiaoqing's song. Her face is similar in appearance. Daixiang often talks to her in the morning and evening, and has a special understanding. She once wrote three jueju poems saying: "Burning the poems and essays, I will end this life. Don't be affectionate in the next life. You say you only pity your shadow, I will pity you as much as you can." "I write poems on the subject of the exotic song, and I have thoughts about the old things in Qiantang. There is little Qing before and little Xiaoqing, both are talented women and have infatuation." Her self-admiration can also be imagined. More than ten years have passed since Daixiang died, and the poems are still extant. It is rare to find. Recording one or two of them is also a fragment of good fortune in the Misty Fragrant Cave.</p>
<p>In addition, there is Yuan Yaqin. "Records of Lustful Travels, Volume 3: Aka Yuan Yaqin, a native of Jiahe, ... a descendant of an official. ... At the time of Qingxin, Ji was only six years old, lost and had no return, and was sold by the wet nurse, so she belonged to the music register, using ballads to gain entanglement. She is calm and quiet, and does not speak or laugh easily..." However, her story still has a tragic nature. Her own experiences are similar to the legendary comedies in old novels, and none of them are more than Qi Kongzhi.

<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Person In Hiding"</p>
<p>A Paramount Pictures production, playing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>This newcomer from Paramount! Mary Morrison, in "Rouge Tiger," has already achieved astonishing success. Her composed face and sharp gaze are the best conditions for her to play villainous roles, and in the romantic arena, the expression of her generally contained passion is similar to that of Dorothy Lamour. We should pay attention to her next work, and I predict she will take the latter path.</p>
<p>This script was written by a G-Man with a history of solving cases. Naturally, writing such a script from the perspective of someone who has experienced it firsthand has its unique aspects. For example, the scene of undercover arrests is truly written with meticulous detail and thoughtfulness. However, he does not portray Dorothy's vanity strongly enough. Such a woman certainly has the possibility of falling, but her ability to immediately strategize and appear as the "Rouge Tiger," committing crimes, is ultimately a bit far-fetched. If the screenwriter had removed the scenes after the undercover arrest (ending the play at this climax would also be natural), and instead emphasized Dorothy's gradual descent in the preceding scenes, thus creating the "Rouge Tiger's" status, the achievement of this play might have been even greater than it is now.</p>
<p>The director tries to avoid robbery scenes as much as possible and focuses on Dorothy's life, which is what makes it endearing and avoids being identical to all other G-Men works. For example, after Dorothy and Martin commit a robbery and escape to the farmhouse where her parents live, he makes it clear that the father and daughter have not seen each other for two years, and there is familial love between the mother and daughter. But when the mother discovers that her daughter is a terrible person, she drives her away and does not allow the father to accept their gifts. The emotion in this scene is very strong. The climax of the undercover arrest is even better at tightly gripping the tense atmosphere that escalates step by step. Of course, half of the credit must also go to the script.</p>
<p>The scenes after the undercover arrest inevitably become somewhat lax. However, Dorothy, unable to bear her elderly mother's arrest, decides to reveal Martin's hiding place as a condition, preparing to flee herself, which gives Mary Morrison and Carl Nash (Martin) another opportunity to act. For example, during their separation and when Dorothy is telephoning the police station, both actors are able to demonstrate their acting skills.</p>
