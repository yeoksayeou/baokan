<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局與波羅的海</h3>
<p>英蘇談判遷延已久，現在更不免因李維諾夫的去職而遭受頓挫；德國對於波羅的海的野心，或因是而更昂進。原來希特勒饞涎欲滴，他向波蘭要求歸還但澤，更向挪威，瑞典，丹麥，芬蘭等國建議訂立互不侵犯條的。但澤是波羅的海沿岸的一個重要港口，希特勒要擴張他的勢力於波羅的海沿岸各國，攫取她們的豐富的原料，自不得不先從佔領但澤着手；同時，他爲杜絕佔領但澤時的後顧之患起見，又不得不以准許芬蘭在埃倫島設防爲餌，誘芬蘭，瑞典，挪威，丹麥和他締結互不侵犯條的，以截斷蘇聯在波羅的海的出路。現在波蘭外長柏克，已在下院發表演說，拒絕了希特勒的要求；而丹麥，挪威，瑞典，芬蘭却定於本月九日在哥本哈金舉行會議，討論希特勒的建議了。</p>
<p>波羅的海位於歐洲的東北部，面積雖不甚大，但圍橈於它四週的國家，都是農業國，原料都很豐富，所以它一向爲歐洲工業國家所視爲外府。在大戰以前由英德俄三國分別宰制着；大戰以後，在它的四週，建立了芬蘭，愛托尼亞、拉特維亞，立陶宛與波蘭五個新興的國家。這些國家、脫胎於凡爾賽和的的所謂「民族自決」的原則；同時也因爲有了這些國家，可以希望和綏波羅的海的四週的鬥爭。但事實的表現，恰恰和期望相反。</p>
<p>芬蘭等國的獲得解放而獨立，雖得力於一九一七年的俄國十月革命，但她們立國之後，就投入英法的懷抱，充作反蘇聯的先鋒。波蘭最初也是法國的與國。一九三三年，希特勒執政以後，法國感到萊茵河對岸威脅的進迫，就改變政策。與蘇聯親善，而波蘭則反採取了親德政策。此後，歐洲反蘇聯的鬥爭，就由英國領導着。於是德國在英國的優容之下，以反蘇聯爲口號。多方面地向東北歐擴張勢力。蘇聯爲對抗這種局勢起見，即和芬蘭，愛托尼亞，拉特維亞與立陶宛等締結互不侵犯條的，以減少德國對她的威脅。然而希特勒在波羅的海的勢力，却仍一天天的膨脹着。現在他旣併吞了米美爾，又圖併吞但澤，並要求在波蘭走廊築一公路，溝通德國和波羅的海的交通，以便由此擴張勢力於北歐。不但如此，他又以准許芬蘭在埃倫島設防爲餌，引誘北歐四國締結不侵犯條的。埃倫島位於波的尼亞灣口，在軍事上和商業上都有重要的價値，因爲扼住了這島，便可控制北歐貿易運輸的出路。一九二二年內國聯決定不准設防。所以這個陰謀，如被實現，則不但波蘭的生存和獨立，岌及可危，即英國在北歐的利益，蘇俄在西陲的安全，都要受到莫大的威脅了。</p>
<p>這種形態的演進，我們得從某種觀點上論斷英國的咎由自取；申言之，最初的領導反蘇聯政策，爾後的玩弄集體安全制，足釀成這種形態的主要因素。最近英國政策確是變了，但是未能在李維諾夫任內完成組織反侵略集團的工作，無論其原因安在，要不能不論斷於英國外交的失敗。然尙須進一步觀察的：英國外交的失敗，不即是侵略國家外交的成功；李維諾夫的去職，不即是蘇聯政策的更張；德國方面故意表示忻慰，事實却相反，因爲野心昂進了，各個擊破的又一機會來臨了，而對英對蘇的利害衝突亦隨之而尖銳了。芬蘭諸國決不致於甘心投入德國懷抱，除非證實了英蘇甘自暴棄。</p>

<p>華沙　柏克外長今晨在衆議院發表演說、首謂曩者、集體安全制度未能實施、各國乃相率採用雙方談話方式、藉謀改善現狀、影響所及、波蘭與某某國之邦交雖見好轉、但與其他某某國之間、則因是而發生嚴重困難、至英波兩國新近訂立互助協定之談判、所由得以迅速告成者、實因雙方對於歐洲各項重要問題、懷抱一致之見解、而英國各當局之充分諒解波蘭立塲、允屬可感、英波兩國均無侵略任何國之意圖、其所蘄求者、端爲國際生活所依據之基本原則、受人尊重而已、以言法波兩國現行同盟條的、實乃「歐洲政治機構之要因素」、至於德波兩國互不侵犯協定原來目標、厥在解決雙方關係、乃德國政府忽於上月二十八日片面予以廢止、其所採之主要論據、則爲指摘英波兩國新近所成立之互助協定、「實則德國政府在採取此項決定之前、並未將英波協定之性質、充分加以研究、上月余自倫敦返國之後、即曾一再表示、準備接見德國大使毛奇、有所說明、無該大使返國述職、爲時一月、始終未來相晤、殊開始料所及」、時至此日、德國眞意何在、亟需有以了解之、衡諸此决廢止互不侵犯協定所採論據、不能不令人生疑、該國簽訂此項協定本意、端在陷波蘭於孤立、阻其與西歐各國友好合作、德國意願豈眞如是耶」、至是、柏克外長乃就德國收回但澤自由市曁建造公路通過波蘭走廊兩項要求、說明見解、略謂、但澤自由市現行制度、並非凡爾賽和的之產物、由來已數百年於茲、該市乃波蘭通往波羅的海之唯一口岸、始終成爲吾國最關重要城市之一、其地日耳曼人所享有之自由權利、從未受波蘭之威脅、波蘭亦從未阻止該市日耳曼人自由發展、此在德國常局、亦曾一再宣稱、德波兩國之間、決不因「省區一城」、而發生衝突、况就波蘭而論、該市若果劃歸德國、各國不復與波羅的海相通、此豈吾人所能接受、又以建造公路通過波蘭走廊而論、其理正復相同、波蘭政府已在交通上以種種便利給予德國、俾波麥拉尼亞省與東普士省、得以互相溝通、「但吾人在本國領土所享有之主權、決不任人加以限制、反之、德國關於但澤自由市與波蘭走廊所提建議、殆即要求吾人出以片面的讓步、抑知任何國、凡具有自尊心者、決不能出以片面的讓步、德國所提交換條件、果何如哉、該國元首希特勒上月二十八日發表演說時嘗云、願與波蘭訂立二十五年五不侵犯協定、並就期洛伐克問題、有所提議、但波蘭政府所知者、僅乃半官式的極空泛的暗示、至是、柏克乃提出結論云、德國倘能表示和平志願與決心、則德波兩國進行談判、仍屬可能、「德國若果接受吾方原則、則變方即可開始談話、屆時波蘭政府當以客觀的態度、充分的誠意、並願及數星期以來之經騐、相與討論當前問題、和平乃一至寶貴之物、但以波蘭人而論、不惜任何代價之和平、絕非所能接受、緣在個人民族與國家之生命中、均有、物允爲可貴、即榮譽是也」云（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）波蘭國外長柏克上校、頃所發表之演說、此官塲人士尙未加以評論、但政界人士印象甚劣、咸謂關於但澤自由市問題、柏克外長雖未關閉談判門戶、但亦未能切實討論希特勒元首在上月甘八日所提出之建議云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）波蘭外長柏克上校頃所發表之演說、此問政界人士因等候原文之故、幷未加以評論、但初步印象尙屬良好、咸謂柏克外長措詞溫和、幷未提出何項要求、如一般人之所顧慮、談判門戶、亦米予以杜塞云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英行徵兵制　歐已發生影響　自由黨撤銷反對　北愛不行徵兵制</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英相張伯倫今日在下院將軍訓法案提付二讀、謂英國人民準備完全履行各種的束之決心、已引起全歐極深切之尊重、此乃毫無可疑者、此法在本年可得新兵二十萬人、三年內可得八十萬人、政府對於良心上反對戰爭者、已予以寬大之考慮、預料此種人數今常較上决大戰時爲少、因此法並非强令國人海外服役、或在壕中作戰、但僅强迫其受短期軍訓耳、至於軍餉問題、在最初六個月中、受訓者每日各得一先令、不因其地位或職業之不同、有所增减、他日升入輔助隊後、其應得之待　、俟日後決定之、凡家屬全恃其贍養者、每週給予特別津貼十七先令、半恃其膽養者、十二先令、有妻者給十七先令有子女者照向來辦法、給予津貼、常備兵與輔助兵之年齡、現校新兵爲高、政府對於常備兵與輔助兵、應得家屬津貼之年齡、現擬規定自二十歲起、至於此法是吾適用於北愛、一政府覺此法推行於北愛、發生特殊困難、故召北愛總理克萊加夫前來倫敦相與討論、北愛爲英國之一部、凡適用於英倫蘇格蘭與威爾斯者、當然亦應適用於北愛、况北愛人民忠於英王與英國、未嘗遜於他人、欲謂北愛人民願免除他處國人所擔仟之義務與犧牲、則污辱北愛、莫此爲甚、克萊加夫來見時、力言北愛忠君愛國之情形、惟覺國家團結爲要、不宜稍有頓挫、故不擬有所舉動、致爲對英不友好之人民所藉口、並願舉北愛所有資源、供英政府運用、凡可有助於英政府者、北愛亟欲爲之、關於最後辦法願聽英政府決定之、北愛總理與其政府此種態度、極爲吾人所歡迎、此爲純粹愛國情緒之表示北愛總理旣請吾人決定辦法、而以重大責任置諸吾人之肩、但吾人不辭責任、故已決定此法不適用於北愛、此法第十五款應予修正、吾人深信、北愛總理向英政府作此建議之精神、可使北愛對於國防有決非細微之供獻、政府今已決定、依照補　後備辦法、以輕坦克車隊之形式、組織一種北愛軍、余確信此項宣佈、當可使北愛大爲滿意也、此法通過愈早、則國家安全愈可早獲保障其在歐洲各國之影響亦愈大、政府提出此案後、已消除國外對於英國眞正積極從事國防以保持本國安全並以履行其的束之疑念、國內不與聞關於戰爭仟何各事者其人極少、至於不準備犧牲自己生命、而願意襄助保全生命者、則其人必多云、</p>
<p>工黨李斯史密士提出修正案、謂志願軍役制、未嘗不可獲取國家所需要之軍額、觀於志願國防兵訓練處外、民衆爭先報名之踴躍情形、可知英國無實施微兵制之必要、今採行歐陸微兵制、以期羅致靑年入營受訓三月至六月、是誠殺鷄用牛刀也、據首相之言、在徵兵法下受訓者、僅二十萬人、但在志願軍役制下則可得七十丸萬人云、</p>
<p>自由黨領袖辛克萊亦發言、贊成志願軍役制、並謂、和平之維持、固繫於英國之實力、道德，堅定、及在他國執政者良心上發生印象之才能、亦繫於英國與共他酷愛和平國之台作、吾人亦必須使德義人民了解吾人對共情感之友好云、</p>

<h3>日本五相會有　決定對歐政策　有田向內閣報告　內容如何尚玄虛</h3>
<p>（東京）據讀賣新聞載、日來五相不圖舉行會議、各重要閣員間亦隨時交換意見、此事已因昨日之五相會議告一段落、日本對歐局應持何種政策、各閣員之意見、業已一致、即當由五相於最短期間再度舉行會議一次、對確定之政策、正式通過云、﹝五日電﹞</p>
<p>（東京）外相有田今日在內閣會報告歐局、外務省發言人今日答各記者問、對於日德義三國訂立軍事同盟之說不願批評、惟稱、日本有其自己獨立的外交政策、是項政策已由首相平沼與外相有田屢次宣示、與民治國或獨裁國均不相同、但志在維持並促進對各外國之友好關係云、(五日路透電)</p>
<p>（東京）昨晚日本政府方面消息、首相平沼對於日德義軍事同盟僅適用於對蘇聯方面一層、現已獲得日阜核准、此即拒絕與歐洲獨裁國家成立反民主國之軍事同盟、此舉不僅足以影響歐局、亦足以影響日本國內之政治、蓋日本之軍人及右派多堅持與德義成立無限制之軍事同盟也、昨日外相有田曾邀請德義大使至外部會談、大約在即日政府此項決定通知德義、據稱、有田曾對二使言、日本雖與德義訂立反蘇聯軍事同盟、但不願與德義訂立反民主國之軍事同盟、據日本各界觀察、此舉可有三種可能的結果、（一）德義方面對於軍統對蘇聯之同盟、或將拒絕訂立、（二）日本既不愿參加反民主國之軍事同盟、則整個反共公約之力量、即須削弱、（三）德日兩國在反共公約上之友誼關係、必將演成敵對關係、蓋德日間之關係、漸趨不良、已隱伏甚久也、(五日美聯電)</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報頃登有駐柏林訪員來電稱、「東京方面盛傳、德義兩國即當簽訂軍事同盟條約、此間消息靈通人士既未加以證實、亦未予以否認、僅謂此聞毫無所知、德義兩國且已在實際上成立軍事同盟、並無簽訂條約之必要」云、(五日哈瓦斯電)</p>
<h3>張伯倫聲明未故意延宕　英俄談判仍在進行中　對俄建議已與法交換意見　李維諾夫辭職各國均重視</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英相張伯倫今日在下院稱、英蘇關於國際時局之談判、刻在進行中、英國並未造成不可避免之延遲、英政府對於蘇聯提案曾與法國交換意見、昨日始接到法國復交、希望日內再將英國意見送交莫斯科、現有若干人抱一種狐疑不定之態度、以為協定尚未成立、或有意見不合之處、其錯必在英政府方面、此種態度、殊屬非是、實未可謂美滿協定不能成立云、(五日路透社電)</p>
<p>（倫敦）此聞各報現仍推測蘇俄外長李維諾夫辭職理由、泰晤士報·新聞紀事報·每日民聲報、皆謂英蘇談判與蘇聯對外政策、不致受其影響、(五日路透電)</p>

<h3>張自忠馮治安兩軍　在襄河東岸抗戰紀</h3>
<p>日軍作戰部隊達兩師團　企圖直趨荊沙威脅宜昌　日軍自稱傷亡六七千人</p>
<p>南漳通信、自二月中至三月初、華軍×××集團軍張自忠馮治安兩軍、與日軍在襄河東岸鍾祥一帶作戰、經過壯烈、迭于日軍以重大打擊、茲紀情形如次、</p>
<p>日軍企圖</p>
<p>二月中旬以來、日軍十六師團長藤江惠福、於佔領天門後、積極在京山皂市一帶、陸續增兵、節節西犯、其作戰之部隊、爲十六師幽全部·及十九師團的一部、與附屬的特穩部隊、外加上僞蒙軍第七路哈童柱部、實力的二萬五千人、於二十二日分三路向漢宜京鍾兩公路及三陽店襄河左岸之華軍陣綫、全面進攻、其企圖在渡越襄河、直趨荊沙、以絕斷華方南北交通、威脅宜昌、冀無西顧之憂、幷由沙跨過大江、進攻湘北、其迷夢不可謂不大、而打破日軍之迷夢者、爲張自忠·馮治安兩軍、該兩軍轄師有六、特種部隊、尙不在內、全體官兵、都是燕趙健兄、實力自不可侮、蓋亦抗戰中之勁旅也、</p>
<p>漢宜路畔</p>
<p>二月二十五日上午、日軍步騎兵共六七百附砲四門、將瓦廟集華軍某部陣地突破後、分向華方義和集×師前進陣地進犯、當時僅有該師×團守兵的一連、以極寡之兵、當方張之寇、與之血拚、傷亡殆盡、幸當晚援隊趕到、義和集終於在一失一得的次日晨曦中穩定了、</p>
<p>當日軍進攻義和集的同時、復以哘砲四門的約六百人、向麒麟觀華軍×　陣地猛攻、往復爭奪、激戰竟日、因守兵抗戰沉着的關係、日軍終不得逞、誰知重要據　之雁門口的×軍陣地、以日軍的大舉進攻、形成很危迫的狀態、華軍×團、爲策應友軍協同動作起見、毅然在自顧不暇的環境中、派魏營駛往應援、半日慘烈的血肉戰、魏營長書橋負傷、回途僅三十餘人、其餘槪作了壯烈的犧牲、在麒麟觀的某團、與日軍互相衝擊的結果、五六百機械化的日兵、固被消滅殆盡、但王團的忠勇戰士、亦有同樣傷亡、</p>
<p>日軍由雁門口衝進、直趨永隆河、於二十七日迫楊家洚與×軍激戰、其主力兩千餘、砲十餘門、折轉北向、威迫華軍右後方、華軍當以主力固守栗樹嶺主陣地帶並向下洋港延伸爲東西綫、復調×師×旅至下洋港泗口向日軍側擊、是時、日軍又以附砲十餘門之兩千餘人增援、改變企圖、迂迴猛攻、以飛機大砲作掩護、突飛猛進、血肉戰在潭家橋何家集一帶展開了、營長張玉良負傷、營附李春霞重傷、其餘官兵雖奮死抵抗、屢挫敵鋒、但以血肉之軀、終抵不住機械的威力、於二十八日在犧牲過重慷慨悲歌的常中、只得將陣地略事移轉、此役可紀的事情很多、第一、×團×營向太和集日軍指揮部襲擊、正突破外衛準備俘敵之間、適日軍援兵趕到、遂於斃日兵八十餘獲機步槍數十支的勝利聲中折轉了、第二、×團向雁門口劉家集以西之日軍側擊、炸燬日軍裝甲車十餘輛幷斃日軍四五十人、第二×旅與日軍陣地戰、迭施痛擊、日軍受重創、華軍固傷亡官兵六七百人、但日軍山雁門口楊家洚運回屍首、　實滿載汽車三十七輛、馳赴皂市、化爲灰盧、運往本國去了、</p>
<p>京鐘綫上</p>
<p>二月二十二日正午、京山日軍賀古旅團的五千餘人、砲二十餘門、分三路向華方孫橋陣地猛犯、華軍×師沉着應戰、日軍未得逞、同時三陽店方面日軍五六百人、猛玫三陽店華軍陣地、華軍×師之一部與日軍激戰、斃日軍二百餘、日軍增援到達、幷以一部攻羅漢嶺、華軍因連絡綫被切斷、遂撤至三陽店以西激戰、</p>
<p>攻孫橋之日軍、連日經華軍×師在蘆家嶺斃日軍甚衆、幷奪獲背包大衣文件及軍需品甚多、二十八日、自晨至晚、允爲壯烈、華軍×師喋血裹創、前仆後繼、日軍死亡者、亦屍骸枕藉、日軍以屢攻受挫、當派有力部隊、向華軍左翼迂迴、並向官橋正面攻擊、華軍×師前後苦撐、傷亡慘重、終於在悲壯聲中、放棄孫橋、轉移至官橋與日軍血拚、</p>
<p>日軍費七晝夜之力、犧牲一千餘人、始得孫橋、華軍×飾、雖未將日軍擊退、但日軍傷亡之重、足以驚破其膽、</p>
<p>當漢宜路之日軍轉移兵力由舊口企圖包圍錘祥的三月一日起、京鍾路方面的戰事更趨激烈、日軍以主力猛攻官橋陣地、復以兩部左右迂迴、威脅東橋、並集中大砲四十餘門之火力、會同日機、結隊輪流轟炸、華軍陣地悉平、日軍又施放大量毒瓦斯、使黃師形成慘烈之陣地戰、而奮不顧生的×師長、仍在前綫指揮、與日軍肉搏、犧牲頗重、往復爭奪者五六次、又由六房咀竄來聯合之日軍千餘人、在左側與華軍×師及柏啟兀部血戰於長壽店以東地區、是時華軍×師及×師之×旅、奉令應援、向東橋側擊、乃一百晚、甫抵長灘埠時、而鄭家集等處之日軍、復以步騎兩千餘、附砲八門、分兩路尾攻、於三日拂曉又展開了一次血戰、</p>
<p>在東橋混戰的當中、另有附砲四門之日軍七八百人、向舊口華軍×師之第二營猛攻、竟日血戰、以日軍火力雖盛、該營二連韓連長陣亡、全連亦作了慘烈犧牲、</p>
<p>三日午後、×帥在新集與日軍遭遇、澈夜苦拚、冀撐危局、×旅亦與優勢之日軍激戰連日、傷亡尤重、均奉命轉移陣地、斯時、戰事已達最猛烈的階段、而日軍亦迫近了鍾祥縣城、</p>
<p>鐘祥血戰</p>
<p>四日的午前、日軍分路猛攻鍾祥、一由大改湖向城急進、一由京鍾路西犯、同時六房咀汪家店之日軍、亦迫近城的東北、華軍×師主力、遂與日軍作正面衝突、城內人民、在傾盆大雨中、扶老携幼、向北撤退、雖然是泥濘滿途、但每個人都是飽含淚珠在泥漿中躑躅、爲了不願做順民、只有暫時離開祖宗墳墓之鄕了、</p>
<p>五日的淸晨、口軍已聚」逼城關了、×師及×師之一部、與日軍發生悲慘的巷戰、數度衝入的日軍、均被無情的大刀砍倒、雖達到了消耗的仟務、但日軍有的是機械化武器的接連衝鋒、致使華軍無法以濟其窮、終於在午前九點鐘的光景、將日機迭炸瓦礫一片的古老縣城宣告放棄了、</p>
<p>鍾祥、雖然是一片瓦礫、毫無用處、但是這幕悲壯的血戰、將永久深印在人們的腦海中、同時也佔據了二期抗戰史上光榮的第一頁、</p>
<p>戰後烏瞰</p>
<p>這次慘烈的戰果、日軍兵員的損失、據口軍目已報告、傷亡已達六七千人、（我想還要多）精疲力竭、無力冉犯、可說在武澳會戰以後、日軍碰着頭一個大釘子、日軍物質上的損失、被華軍奪獲機步槍四十餘支、炸燬裝甲車十餘輛、幷獲得重要文件軍用品背包大衣等百餘件、其餘物品亦不少、華軍雖有相當犧牲、但在民族戰爭的大時代中、却也値不得如何的顧慮、</p>
<p>現在的形勢、日軍是在襄河東岸各渡口、集結達兩萬人、沿河擾亂、虛發砲聲、並準備架橋材料及船隻、企圖乘隙倫渡、其着眼點、當在針對沙洋一點、刻×××集團軍、已會同各友軍、嚴密佈置、再予打擊、故半月來、日軍終不敢越雷池一步、我們試看日軍初期進展之速、及此次化半年工夫、才得到死城一座、故武器裝備雖優於華軍、而此决作戰、兩軍員兵損失的比較、可云死傷相等、實創開戰以來的新紀錄、（四月四日自南漳武女堰寄）</p>

<p>豆米市場昨晨停市</p>
<p>滬市存米至四月底爲止、爲六十一萬一千一百五十三包、較上次僅减少四萬一千三百零三包、可謂存底尙稱充足、民食暫不致缺乏、而本市米價因來貨較前稀少、突然飛漲逾越十叫元限價高便羊尖竟漲至十五元以十、雖經市塲管理委員會勸告無效、以致市塲發生不正當之暗盤交易、昨晨九時開市時、米價繼續飛漲漫無止境、管理委員會無法制止、不得已宣告臨時停市、靜待午後三時之各米業團體聯席會議決定之、</p>

<p>勸導客商踴躍採購</p>
<p>荳米市塲昨因暗盤高漲、以致臨時宣告暫停營業、新聲社記者昨向豆米市塲管理委員會探悉、該市塲決於今日起照常開市營業、屆時並由市塲管理一委員會主席委員符前耕、向各　販運客商報告米業團體聯席會議經過、力勸儘量向產地採購、以資調劑滬市民食、各米業團體將昨日聯席會議經過情形、報請兩租界當局、及市商會備查、並將公告豆米市塲、</p>

<h3>日方處心積慮　謀變更租界行政　日領訪英美領及工部局　提出修改地皮章程要求</h3>
<p>字林報云、日木總領事館昨（四日）晚發出公報、內稱、日總領事三浦於昨日午後連續訪晤英總領事斐利浦·美總領事高斯·及工部局總董樊克令、要求修改日方所稱陳舊的地皮章程、以改組公共租界之行政、三浦並極言特區法院有「實際上改革」之必要、其法官係重慶政權所委任、「在上海區無實權」、而判決反日份子云、</p>
<p>三浦抗議</p>
<p>係緊隨上海日本陸海軍當局於星期二日發表聯合宜言、對外國管理區之現有情况、表示不滿、與日外務省次官澤田於星期三日向英大使克萊琪·及美大使格魯·表明日本希望改革公共租界兩事而發、聞英美兩總領事均允三浦將此事各自報告本國政府、樊克令氏自已</p>
<p>拒不批評</p>
<p>惟稱、是項問題、須由領事團決定之、三浦昨晚語日籍記者云、地皮章程不習成爲公共租界之憲法、對地皮章程如不加以考慮、則自實際的與法律的觀點而論、關於公共租界之難題、難以獲得根本之解決、故余於今日訪晤時、提出改正地皮章程之</p>
<p>具體建議</p>
<p>吾人或可云所謂公共租界問題者、今已進入最後階段、觀於英人掌握公共租界之實權、而由美人扶助之、故余先訪此兩國領事、俾使彼等對吾人之見解獲得印象、今吾人旣已捉出爭端、未獲結果、自不能放棄之、吾人決使有關各國與吾人獲得妥協、意國總領事兼領袖領事贊成改地皮章程、實爲吾人之佳運此乃</p>
<p>交換意見</p>
<p>後余所發現者、余覺此點將證明其爲有價値之援助云、日領事署公報復稱、三浦閘明日政府處理公共租界之決心態度、三浦曾語其同僚云、東京當局認爲「根本修改」七十年前採用之地皮章程、及改革法院、使其迎合「新局勢」、均屬必要、</p>
<h3>寗波　市區安靜</h3>
<p>商店夜間晉業　撫輯工作忙碌</p>
<p>寗波被日機三度轟炸後、市容非常荒凉、白晝居民、多避郊外、人口大减、入晚始稍稍集市、寗波被炸以後、</p>
<p>商區迅速疏散</p>
<p>寗波被炸以後、中山東路（即東門衛）一帶、以屬繁盛區域、該區商店、爲减少空襲損失、將商品實行疏散、以致遷徒車輛、廖局踵接、情形忙迫、近日以來、則已比較趨於安定、</p>
<p>夜市情況一瞥</p>
<p>寗波商業、營業時出、已由白晝改爲夜間、計自傍晚五時起至九時、至銀錢業則提早一小時、自晚五時起至八時止、星期日休假、惟夜市狀况、亦殊蕭條、</p>
<p>積極進行善後</p>
<p>自上月二十八日、及本月一二兩日被連續轟炸以後、甬埠精華、元氣斵傷、至刦後難民、擔輯與救濟、現山地方當局、會同甬商會等團體、積極進行、</p>
<p>市區日來安靜</p>
<p>本月三日、寗波亦鳴警報、旋日機由餘姚方面、侵入甬境惟並未停留、即東向鎭海出縣境而去、四日終日安靜、外傳且機於本月三日炸紹興消息、迄無　實、</p>

<h3>月蝕放爆竹　日方指為示威</h3>
<p>竟稱有反日機關指使　已請工部局調查其事</p>
<p>偽市長又提禁止懸旗要求</p>
<p>大陸報云、據昨日（四日）本榫日文大陸新報載稱、本埠日當局於星期三日晚「懷遺憾」而觀察因月蝕而起之「爆竹擾亂」、頃向公共租界工部局提出請求「調查此事」華人燃放爆竹、紀念月蝕、乃另一種「以迷信習俗爲掩飾之反日示威運動」云、按照中國古時之迷信、龍吞月亮、必須大量聲響、將龍嚇走、此事實、大陸新報未考慮及之、惟該報批評此事曰、燃放爆竹、乃「有系統的」爲之、故「可認爲有反日機關在後指使、因其「喧擾」、頗有組織也、</p>
<p>戰事爆發</p>
<p>後、旣已嚴禁燃放爆竹、則在臨近日方佔據地帶之區域內燃放爆竹實爲「故意的反日示威運動」工部局完全不顧星期三日之騷動、故「不能逃避未適當管理其轄區內人民之指摘」云、大陸新報所刊關於此事之另一文稱日當局常取、切可能之防備、不使擾亂人心、例如日本海軍陸戰隊每遇演習、必通知工部局、以免</p>
<p>擾亂公衆</p>
<p>云、記者以上述論調、告公共租界警務人員、據稱、彼等未能於事前月蝕事通知日當局、頗爲遺憾云、又「上海市長」傅筱庵昨日照會法總領事、公共租界工部局與領事團、重提兩租界內完全禁懸中國國旗之要求、傳致法當局之「照會」、由其某爪牙致送、傀儡市長對法租界當局於四月十九日進行中國國民精神總動員時、禁懸國旗、</p>
<p>所取態度、表示「感謝」、旋稱、除非法租界當局以四月十九日所表現之同樣精神繼續禁懸國旗、渠恐法租界之和平與秩序、或將蒙受危害、傳致工部局及領事團之「請求中、對工部局未如其請而採取適當辦法、絕對禁懸中國國旗、藉以維持和平與秩序一節、表示「遺憾」、傳又對五月中國民黨及中國之紀念日頗多一點、</p>
<p>喚起注意</p>
<p>並表示其意見　爲彼所謂「和平與秩序」之故禁懸中國國旗應立刻有所行動云、又據大陸新報戰稱、昨日蘇州河北岸父發出另一不平之言、「滿洲國政府「駐滬代表」對本埠俄文日報所載關於「康德皇帝」（亨利溥儀）一文、表示憤懣、又稱在滬「滿洲國當局」對此文、決向工部局提出强硬抗議、如屬必要、彼等準備取有效而</p>
<p>適當手段</p>
<p>、該報指俄文日報爲蘇聯機關報所載一文、爲「未之前見的侮辱一述及「滿洲國皇后」、稱爲「溥儀之妻」、乃直接之侮辱、因「皇帝」之正式名稱、今爲康德云、俄文日報經理咋晚發表文告吾認曾載侮辱「滿洲國君王」之文、又稱日方所傳不確、文告中表示對日文報紙、將取法律步驟</p>

<h3>公共租界工部局　在滬西區之設施</h3>
<p>警務人員比從前增加三倍　工廠百餘家勒令停閉他遷</p>
<p>本年納稅外僑開會時、會通過關於滬西界外馬路區域現狀之議案一項、當經工部局總董聲明本屆各董事當儘量採取各項措置、以改進西區之狀況、關於此事、工部局董事會已有所考量、已往工部局各處在西區之設施、略述如下、</p>
<p>（一）警務</p>
<p>戰事以後、工部局警權所及之區域內、盡夜服務之警員人數、比從前增加三倍以上、堪稱實力充足、西僑住宅中、戰後未有盜案發生攔路強盜案、僅於上年十二月間發生一起、竊案次數較多、惟一批竊賊、均係來自租界鱗境、行竊以後、窺回原處、發生竊案之處所、經查明大都缺少相當安全設備、因此各住戶亟應設法防備、如欲雇用司閣捕、可向警務處陳請、竹籬上宜裝鐵絲、圍牆愈堅愈好、警務處已發明一種有效而價廉之裝窗方法、公衆可往詢問、各馬路口鐵絲網架之隙口、業經盡量减少、惟正當商人之合法利益、自當顧及、</p>
<p>（二）衛生</p>
<p>除通常衛生事務外、工部局已雇用工人一百五十名、在西籍職員監督之下、專在西區担仟改良衛生工作、例如淸掃難民收容所、掃險糞便垃圾、塡平污池、以及疏浚河浜等、如有屍棺發現、即由若輩報告衛生處、以便處置、衛生處之職務、巳因處置屍體而大感繁重、</p>
<p>（三）火政</p>
<p>爲預防火警起見、救火會曾於界外馬路區域舉行調查一决、查明何處有何種危險、何處有水管可用、以及何處有河浜等、自河浜內取水之方法、並經加以研究、如有疑問、即予實地試騐、數月以前、救火會長曾頒發特別通告、令飭各救火員遵照、哥倫比亞路與惇信路等處、已經添裝龍頭、</p>
<p>（四）工廠</p>
<p>西籍工程師一人、已經工部局聘用、以協助工務處職員管理工廠、經勒令停閉或遷至非住宅區域之工廠、已有一百餘家、任何工廠、倘事實上難以遷移、其工廠計劃、須經考慮、以便减少擾及鄰居之機會、所有開設於住宅附近之工廠、如易發生可厭惡之情事、則由該工程師每星期視察一次</p>

<h3>外輪多艘泊漢　日方不准下駛</h3>
<p>漢口商業已趨停頓　長江水道景象淒涼</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、外國航運公司之輪船十二艘以上、被日當局强行扣留、今泊漢口、其中大多爲英輪、荷蘭輪二艘、葡萄牙輪至少一艘、內有若干艘，自揚子江一帶發生戰事起、即泊漢口、故亟須加以檢騐、但日方拒不准許彼等下駛、某英輪輪長於漢口離其輪、而乘第三國砲艦來滬、認記者云、各輪</p>
<p>被扣於漢</p>
<p>實絕無理由、自漢至滬之揚子江全程、標記淸楚、今江水高漲季節將屆、江中航行、殊少危險云、戰事初起時、華軍移去江中之航運協助物、但今已有淸楚之標記、可爲日軍已重置此等協助物之明證、外國砲艦與載運供應品之大批日方運輸輪來往揚子江中、可見水道</p>
<p>航行安全</p>
<p>各軍艦與六千噸之運輸輪可行駛、則駛行江中之商輪、必無危險、本埠航運界相信江行航輪之被扣、足見日方之排斥外商航運態度、日當局似活躍從事於傷害中立國航運之工作、同時對於沿江口岸、亦不提供便利、揚子江之封鎖、亦影響及閒泊上海之江行航輪、因揚子江中之商航被禁止故也、今泊漢口之輪中、若干艘於二年前即應</p>
<p>加以檢騐</p>
<p>漢口商業、已趨停頓、食糧囤積過多、而乏人購買、炎夏將臨、冰將成嚴重問題、日軍當局已同意各冰廠以冰供給日軍、則日軍以煤供給冰廠、迄今爲止、雙方尙未商妥、揚子江以往航運繁盛、今則呈荒凉景象、由漢至滬、水道中頗爲悽凉、兩岸城鎭、亦荒無人烟、</p>

<p>契據</p>
<p>允許當夜九時回家、由原告簽立六千元收據、當時百般詐欺、令原告先簽字後付款、幷催促速行簽立、吾則分文不給、及至夜間收款時、祇交予終止收養據一紙、忽又强立六百元收據、斯時始閱見終止收養據上書有不規正道及不許操自幼所習之製燭</p>

<p>愛多亞路南面中滙大樓鄰右某紗布莊主吳姓、年正花甲、其妻董氏、亦已白髮婆娑、家庭中蘭桂競秀、其原籍爲澉浦、但旅滬業巳多年、該莊乃吳所手創、因彼長袖善舞、故營業甚爲發達、今則殆執該業之牛耳、積資頗厚、雖已名成利就、然對於店務家政、依然事必躬親、不稍假手於妻孥之輩、惟吳</p>
<p>年齡雖老</p>
<p>精力猶强、八年之前、曾邂逅一麗姝在文英、時其芳齡雙十、適未有偶、吳覺其人洵堪憐愛、即以甘言相誘、在竟感於富有之名、遂委身事之、吳旣得此少艾、爲防杜髮妻之干涉、及兒孫輩之譏諷起見、故於藏嬌之所、嚴守秘密、數載以還、無論其家屬或親友、皆無所知、而吳對其諸卑幼、更</p>
<p>道貌岸然</p>
<p>藉以掩飾　詎至最近、春光忽爾洩露、寵妾所居之公共租界厦門路尊德里左近一百四十四號門牌屋內三層樓前樓之地點、突被乃妻發見、並且訪悉在文英自與吳同居後、已經生有一子、現已七齡、在氏年華、則已三九矣、於是不動聲色、於上月二十四日夜十時後、知吳已赴妾處、始投該管老閘捕房、告發所天</p>
<p>與人犯姦</p>
<p>請求查究、當由捕頭派探目張克勤、按址馳往、查明屬實、當塲將吳等一干男女、帶回捕房偵訊、是時吳之子女人等、聞信之下、因事件之構成者、係屬生身父母、萬不能作左右袒、第又米可袖手旁觀、爰於輕易無法解決、而不背情理之原則下、先行委託吳律師當晚前往捕房聲明、此乃</p>
<p>家庭糾紛</p>
<p>嗣經捕頭詰問一過、姑准將逮捕諸人、暫予令退、聽候核辦、吳等歸後、汪文英深恨吳當初純用欺騙手段致伊遭此羞辱、且此後身份、顯有問題、爲保障本人及所生之子生存計、茲已正式與吳提起交涉、而吳妻董氏、日來亦對吳提出條件、要求吳自今以後、不再與在氏</p>
<p>發生關係</p>
<p>並要求將全部財產權交出、歸彼督同共子管理、至於吳對於大婦小星所提各點、刻尙在分別審慮、是吾容納、抑竟拒絕、甚至引起訟端、殊難逆料、總之、此乃一錯綜復雜之事也</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「天下太平」？</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>蘇聯外交委員長李繼諾夫的辭職，引起了許多國的猜測，許多人的評論，各言之成理，無懈可擊。當然，我也有一些意見。我的意見是天下從此太平（？）了!</p>
<p>我不是說李維諾夫爲擾亂天下太平者，他一去，所以天下就太平，乃是說，他的去，在我看來，也許正因為史丹林認歐洲已沒有問題，至少已沒有蘇聯挿身其問，為他國樺塲的必要。歐洲的沒有問題，也不是說歐洲的禍根已經誅滅，或已經有什麽長治久安的辦法，大家已經巡行，乃是說，英法，允其英，已經和德義，尤其德，妥洽了，凡事就可從長計議了。所謂長者，也許非事理之長，正是時間之長。本此妥洽精神，又益以時間之長，揖讓進退，從容討論，蘇聯無置喙之餘地，亦無置喙之必要，李維諾夫不辭職，將何以自解？蘇聯不退出，又將何以自解？</p>
<p>我說這話，也並非完全出於臆測，倫敦哈瓦斯電說明英國與蘇聯暫停集體安全組織的談判，有四個原因，很可以作爲我說的根據：一，張伯倫聲明，不包圍德國，而「樂於考慮」英德兩國的「互相保障」；二，德波有進行「友好談判」的可能；三，德國已向北歐各國提議訂立互不侵犯條的；四，義大利與英法的邦交已好轉，而不致與德國共同作戰。如此如意算盤，一旦打成，豈非天下太平？天下旣可由此而太平，又何必惡狠狠，血淋淋，從事於集體安全組織，自討苦吃？</p>
<p>不過天下果然從此可以太平麽？我在旬日前，曾論及歐局的「不了了之」，而終有不得了的斷言。現在，我還是這個信念：李維諾夫的辭職，可以作爲蘇聯不參加中歐糾紛，暫取觀望的表示，也可以作爲英法不需要蘇聯，而對德義妥洽的微象，但是，這正如一個毒瘤，雖然暫時不化膿，不感痛苦，而毒性依然，終有發作的一日，並且爲了一再躭誤，沒有早日割治，發作起來只有格外厲害罷了。那時，英法還是要手忙脚亂的，還是要向蘇聯求助的，蘇聯會不會再出來供人利用，爲人犧牲，就很成問題了。</p>
<p>在我想，要天下眞正太平，至少要歐洲眞正太平，就只有英法蘇的切實聯合。然而英法似乎志不在此，我也就只有希望我的觀察錯誤，而天下果然會太平！</p>
<h3>守夜</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>——壯丁生活的片段</p>
<p>黑暗的夜幕，廣闊地伸展在人底眼前。萬籟盡寂的郊野，恬靜得陰森可怖，看不見田隴和村莊，也聽不到人聲和大呋。舉頭遙望，祇有黑漆的一片；那條沿着鐵路伸展的壕溝，也和地面融合了。</p>
<p>在曠野裏，守夜的壯丁向壕溝行進；路徑雖因黑暗而須要摸索，却什麽也沒有困難。</p>
<p>沿着鐵路摸索，到了壕中，匍匐前行，一霎那間，就通過了整條壕溝，走到盡頭；隨着怖崗，守望。</p>
<p>在壕中，意想着一種不停止的侵襲，把前面的山峯，茅屋，樹叢，都當作了來夜襲的日機。我們不因在後方，而疏略於防禦；也不因在暗夜，而鬆弛於警視；祇有加强的探索，堅守！空間的行雲，稀疏的樹叢，閃爍的幾點燈火，風吹草原的細微聲響，都在我們的心版上，烙着淸晰的印痕。一羣人的勇敢，鎭定，警察，十足表現出豐滿的戰鬥力量。</p>
<p>每個人豎起耳朶，傾聽那沉靜裏流迸的夜韻，傾聽那高空裏自然音樂的生滅。，在這冷肅而凄寂的郊野，雖沒有火花的爆裂，但幻念到前綫的戰鬥景象，我們的心就會跳躍起來！</p>
<p>這時候，突然一陣微弱的聲響，由山坳裏傳來。我們用手電筒一射，三個糢糊的人影，就立刻映入眼廉。，迫切地，提高着喉嚨喝問一聲口令，那邊不睬。再接着又喝問一聲，那邊才回問一聲「口令」。待我們答出了口令的上文時，那邊又答不出來，而沉默無聲了。</p>
<p>「沒有口令？」一羣人由疑惑而緊張起來，一聳身，跳出壕，就跑步包圍過去；許多條手電筒的光錢，集中在那三個人身上，他們也立刻停止行動，喝問口令：</p>
<p>「最後」——「勝利」</p>
<p>口令喊通了，走近去仔細一望，原來是教練官同旅部的參謀長，特意來視察，試騐我們的防禦精神的。另一個人就是勤務兵。在敬禮之後，教練官笑着問我們。。「如果眞的上前綫守夜，遇到沒有口令的人，你們怎樣處置？」</p>
<p>「包圍，搜查，繳械，押送到……。」</p>
<p>教練官點點頭。繼續笑着說：「最要緊的是：機警和聯絡；視覺和聽覺須控制叫方；應該疾進的時候，才跑步；脫離了指揮，也要能够單獨動作。」</p>
<p>回到壕中，站住崗位。又殷切地重溫着心裏的期望：我們的力量，也許會有所成就於某一處陣地，而把勝利的愉快充實起來吧？</p>
<p>夜愈深沉，也愈黑暗，風也愈大。，仰望高空，由於自然籌調的逐漸尖峭，我們就意會到上半夜的時間巳過去了。當第二班守夜的壯丁，摸索着夾換班後，我們雖然踏上了歸途，還是對着壕溝依戀。</p>
<h3>天外之夢</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>惱人天氣，屋子裹躭不住；閒着，在園中搖起方步。發現草綠了，花紅了；這些在終日忙着的人的靈魂上，是一種『意外的發現』，像沙漠中發現一溪淸流般，滋潤乾枯的心情。</p>
<p>幾天來老過着機械的生活，老在高速度下趕這樣趕那樣；除了身上覺到暖和之外，幾乎不知道季節的改變。偶然在園中得之，自是另一種特殊的感覺。譬如在荒蕪的路上，拾到一朵淸新嬌艷的玫瑰花，一定會想出一段美麗的故事，或者一首動人的詩曲；這些，也就是我『天外之夢』的夢材。所謂『天外之夢』，就是我在園中偶然尋到了春的踪跡，而編造成的故事。</p>
<p>冬天的逝去，像一塊冰漸漸在暖手中溶化一樣，冰塊中也許有不少黑沙，可是溶成了水之後，黑沙也就在水滴中漏掉了。春天的風也正是吹散黑沙的手掌，但願前一個季節裏的黑沙，都在春天裹片片漏去，讓一個純白的世界活起來。</p>
<p>夢，常常是事實之母，同時也往往是迷人的網。我記得小時候有一决曾在綠茵地上睡過午覺，醒來已是黃昏，着了一身凉，生了塲病。如今，又在綠茵地上偷睡了。</p>
<p>於是，我得了這天外之夢。在冥想的宇宙間，我發現了另一個美的世界，醒來，正是夕陽無限好</p>
<p>夢醒了，自己編造的故事也告了段落。</p>
<p>不是嗎？夢常常是事實之母；可是先得掙出這『迷人的網』。網外是活的淸水，是自由世界。</p>
<p>不知不覺，又使我吟起低音的調子。</p>
<p>第一曲</p>
<p>我輕歌未來之音，</p>
<p>蕩漾在酒味本中。</p>
<p>希望之神的衣裙，</p>
<p>飄拂過我的肩頭。</p>
<p>第二曲</p>
<p>希望是什麽顏色，</p>
<p>什麽味什麽模樣？</p>
<p>你掉頭騰上雲間，</p>
<p>留給我一陣惘悵。</p>
<p>第三曲</p>
<p>我不再回頭留戀，</p>
<p>過去是一陣薄烟。</p>
<p>隨着風輕飛慢舞，</p>
<p>飄往渺遠的天邊。</p>
<p>第四曲</p>
<p>唱吧，四行輕音，</p>
<p>低迴的柔腸曲調！</p>
<p>無限情愫騙去了：</p>
<p>心上的一點靈珠。</p>
<p>尾聲</p>
<p>遠行的人，心頭上——</p>
<p>淚點灑不盡，照個金戈影兒！</p>
<p>也許這『低音奏』可以算是生命的渣滓吧；但願這也是天外之夢帶來的淺痕，讓吹不盡的春風把牠吹散了吧！</p>

<h3>以身作則</h3>
<p>— 陳康白</p>
<p>這不是一句流行的術語，而是負有「模範作用」的人底一條鐵律。</p>
<p>眞的是一個「言」「行」相符的人，無論居家也好，從公的也好，定然什麽事都弄得妥妥善善的。反之，要是你的言論跟行爲脫了節，任憑你嘴巴說得如何地漂亮，講得如何地動聽，一過了氣，什麽事也就跟着完了。甚至當塲便有人在背後暗暗的說一聲，「他是說說的呢！」</p>
<p>身爲家長的人，飲食起居，倘能時時刻刻顧到孩子的影響，待人接物，處處本着「以身作則」爲前提，那麽他們的子弟，不用說，自然是會謙恭有禮捨己爲羣的。從前范希文先生一生急公好義，博施濟衆，是以他底幾個兒子咸能克紹箕裘，光宏父業。此無他，耳濡目染，潛移默化，使之然也。</p>
<p>一個從政的公務員，眞的做到「苟非吾之所有，雖一毫而莫取。」那麽他的屬下，用不到時刻脣焦舌敝的來訓誡，自然也會狷介自守的。孔老夫子說：「不義而富且貴，於我如浮雲。」一所以他老人家相魯三月，魯國就有「道不拾遺」的好政績。而且像他那麽多內門徒中，也絕少有撈進來就算帳的高足。這也是「以身作則」的功效，不是專憑「夏楚畏之」的結果。</p>
<p>趙侗成了抗戰期中的一個游擊隊底模範將領，我以爲多半是得力於富於民族思想的母親底陶薰的。不然的話，趙侗要那樣做，做母親的時刻以老命來阻撓他，在柬北那麽艱苦的環境中，私運軍火，秘密組織，怕難以那麽順利地進行着吧。</p>
<p>謝晋兀在淞滬諸役中，屢次作戰，皆能身先士卒，其忠與衛國的正氣，直可泣天地而驚鬼神。所以他的部下，也能視死如歸，看國家重如泰山了。「八百孤軍」與「四行倉庫」的相對字眼，現已成了國際上的專名了。</p>
<p>然而抗戰起後，我國文武官員，像這樣的壯烈的事蹟。着實是罄竹難書。只要稍微留心報章的人，時常都可看到相類似的紀載的。這，多由於中央正大的國策所感召，有以致之。同時，也可敎訓對方，中華民族的自由，中華民國的領土與主權，是絕對不可侵犯，絕對不可掠奪的。</p>
<p>對方不會想到「多行不義，必自斃！」這句話。他們以侵略慘殺的暴行，哄騙欺蒙的言辭，教會了他們的國民，將來他們也會自食其果，世界古今的歷史上，已不少這樣的先例了。</p>
<p>不過，話得說回來，我以爲「以身作則」四字，不但在國民精神總動員的現在，我們須明顯的寫在腦子的深處，即在將來的牛安時期，我們更得牢牢的記在心頭。要這樣，什麽事才能弄得好！什麽事才能幹得起！抗戰建國的大業才能完成！</p>
<p>這，——「以身作則」——確不是一句流行的術語，而是負有「模範作用」的人底一條鐵律。</p>

<h3>糧食　米限價寬放一元</h3>
<p>廠粳十五元尖秈十四元　西貢米高至十八元五角</p>
<p>國米市自前兩日一經打破十四元限價、高粳竟超出十五元後、昨日一經開市、又呈暴風、客尖立漲四五角、形勢愈見混沌、當時市場委員眼見此種情形、非可了局、迺即立時設法、祇得通告同業暫停交易、於下午召集米糧七團體開會討論辦法、致昨市未有市面、下午各米糧團體在雜糧公會討論結果、以十四元限價、施行二月於茲、但以目前事實困難、致一時打破限價、共原因誠以內地各路來源多所被阻、糙價高漲、據云若無錫在某方壟斷之下、每日僅允運出五車、其數爲七百五十包、而常熟江陰等區、至今尙未疏通、更如松江縣、該地某方一方設有誠記洋行、獨自搜羅、一方則禁運出境、且對於米價乘意爛放、繼以强迫、致該地糙價已至十二元八角至十三元、而原白粳價竟出十三元五六角、此種米價與滬市相合、須售十五元出另、不特該區如是、他方亦屬相同、因之在滬貨主、爲顧全血本、不得不極力抬售、而造成此種市面、公會際此、未常不再謀遏制、但在各方面着想、當亦須顧念客商經營之困苦、所以議決、准暫與開放一元、高粳價定限十五元、而羊杜尖相仝其他各尖最高價限十四元、一律中决照別、仰各米客行號極力遵行、然或以後依然私售暗盤、超出限價、若經調査證實、即由市場委員會及評價委員會制裁、處以嚴厲之罰款、充作難民捐、一方通知英法兩工部局及市商會備案云云、（十五元限價、合舊海斛十七元六角五分）</p>
<p>客秈昨日店囤胃口均健、本尖因停市關係、本街零化隨移神於洋客秈，故價一再抬升、高貨漲三四角、中擋漲五六角、南京秈已衝出十四元、蕪秈亦至十四元左右、貨方看好扳持、全日交易的四千多包、</p>
<p>洋米昨被本街店囤注意、市面突呈緊張、高西貢扳高至十八元半、中决亦關十八元一二角、行囤以存底不豐、定價高昂、均堅持檳守、故成交仍不足千包、惟國外定價步漲、昨電訊西貢合二元左右、尙差一元半、未能定購云、</p>
<h3>廠盤過高　本粉客銷轉淡</h3>
<p>小麥廠辦形同停頓</p>
<p>麵粉　日本現粉市况、漲風暫告平息、查客帮銷場、經前日一度趨活後、昨市較遜、因廠盤一再提高、更無大額現粉供給、故客胃亦鮮熱烈之垂靑、且邇日洋粉洋麥、均有到滬、廠方爲顧及洋粉之軋脚起見、亦無意再事喊價、結果仍以原盤供給、本街零批交易外、而客盤仍有五分至二分半之上落、統市成交併計的有四萬包以上、市面大局漸趨盤旋狀態、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨本麥來源、逐有零星抵埠、交易仍淸蓋目下洋行所到之澳洲麥等、均已整批直接配廠、各廠因洋麥原料尙充、對本麥需要日淡、　門市零星收買外、概不向市購辦、</p>
<h3>關於戰事損失　處理辦法之商榷</h3>
<p>— 陸善熾</p>
<p>八一三戰事以來，淪陷之區，廬舍爲墟，工商事業，多數受有影響，雖其損害程度，各有不同，但應亟謀救濟，以圖善後則一。本市奚玉書會計師，前曾爲此事，擬具意見，呈請經濟部鑒核，最近接到批覆，由奚會計師加具補充辦法，公開發表，工時工商事業，因鑑於切身利害關係之重大，莫不深切注意，熱烈討論。作者以爲對於戰事損失之處理，固應有一具體辦法，以資遵循；但此項辦法之內容，應如何決定，實宜愼重考慮，以期周密，吾則措置失當，將貽工商界以不良之影響，爰不揣譾陋，略貢芻見，以爲商榷。</p>
<p>查此决奚氏提案及經濟部批示辦法之內容，一將戰事損失作爲遞延資產，以逐年盈餘攤指抵補訓一點，爲最重要。對於此項辦法，吾人以爲稍嫌簡略，恐難以一律遵循；同時旣以戰事損失作爲遞延資產，復指定須以遂年盈餘，攤提抵補，亦覺於用語上，略嫌含混。蓋遞延資產一詞，原係會計上之專用名詞，依會計方法，對於遞延資產之攤提，必須在決算整理時行之；換言之，即須先將遞延資產之攤提額，列爲損費，而後算出純益，並非先行算出純益，而後從事於攤提。故如果以戰事損失，作爲遞延資產辦理，則其攤提抵補，應不能從逐年盈餘中爲之；但如調攤提扺補，果應在盈餘中爲之，則戰事損失，將不能作爲遞延資產處理。是以照原文字義上解釋，對於戰事損失，究應如何處理，實並未明瞭。惟就其以後所示攤提年限上之限制情形，加以推測，則似係指其攤提抵補，應在決算前行之者，蓋吾則所得稅之計算，原係以純益爲標準，凡有盈餘即當納稅，更何必顧及其攤提年限哉？以下請先就戰事損失是吾可以作爲遞延資產處理一點，加以討論。</p>
<p>會計學上遞延資產一詞，係從英語Deferred　Assets轉譯而來，就Deferred之字義解釋，原作延輾或延長講。會計上對於若干預付之費用，因其效益，有延輾至决年之可能，同時對於此項損費，事實上亦不應由本年負担，故特暫時作爲資產，一則使其效益，可以延輾至决年，同時亦可以將本年度不應負担之損費，轉嫁至决年，其竟甚深，其法甚善。故如預付房租，預付保險費等之支出，在會計上，殆已確認其爲遞延資產之性質，但如對於開辦費，即因於其效益延輾及應吾轉嫁至决年負祖之點，不免發生疑義，故至今學者間意見，尙未能一致確認其爲遞延資產之一種。茲戰事損失，其發生焉，完全非於事前所能逆料，且發生之後，旣無效益可以延輾至决年，亦並無理由，可以主張必須由以後各年度分担，其爲確定之損失，而不能與預付費用，相提並論，甚爲明顯。此就會計理論上，認爲有待商榷者一。</p>
<p>任何事業，欲期健全發展，以謀資本充實爲唯一要務。充實資本之道，在積極方面，應有多量之公積，在消極方面應無虛抬之財產。公司法上對於盈餘之分派，規定須提存公；對於金錢外之財產出資，監視特嚴；對於股本之折價發行，懸爲禁令；與夫商人通例及所得稅法令上，對於財產估價，獎勵低價：均無非欲期事業之資本，趨於充實。茲就戰事損失而言，其原有財產，顯已喪失，資本顯已虧蝕，但若仍令其在帳面上保留爲資產，顯於資本充實之原則，大相違背。恐共結果，對於目前之困難，未必即能藉此而緩和，但對於將來自力更新之企圖，反見大有危害。此就事業理財上，認爲有待商榷者二。　（未完）</p>
<h3>金融　現金交易極淸</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况突轉平靜局勢、中途毫無精彩可言、漲落差額、亦僅二元之數、價則終日逗留於二千一百零八元左右、惟晨開情勢略帶疲軟、嗣因某金號（代厦門帮）與某錢兌業相繼吸購致稍見回高、然結果則仍軋跌二元、交易上午平淡、祗做開三百五十兩、而下午聞買方喊二千一百零七元、但售者須照午收價二千一百零九元方肯供給、致一無成交、銀樓飾金未見更動、英純金復向上漲、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市跌二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開市勢略帶軟化、首由錢兌業互做五十兩、二千一百零七元爲開槃價、較之前收做低四元、開後某金號代厦門帮趁低吸購、銀樓帮及同業各五十兩、價均與晨開相同、繼之銀樓帮吸進金號五十兩、價零八元、後某錢兌業又賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價零七元、此後另一錢兌業又興買風、致潛勢步高、吸進同業五十兩、價零八元五角、後再進同業五十兩、價零九元、此後有賣戶而無進者、致未做開、故午收價仍爲零丸元、午後供求愈稀、僅有少數買戶、喊零七元、然售者須照午收價零九元、方肯供給、雙方直檳持至四時後、仍未見做開、若照午收價二千一百零九元、結果則較隔昨晚收軋跌二元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百十五元、收進二千一百元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金未見更動</p>

<p>純金回漲半便士</p>
<p>四日倫敦電、英純金每盎司回漲半便士、計屬七鎊八先令六便士、然中央銀行各行市價因値革命政府成立紀念、循例休業一天、故均無市、</p>
<h3>外滙供求　復歸平衡</h3>
<p>滙市昨各大洋行詰款雖仍旺盛、兼華商投機家亦起扒結、但以英美等各外商銀行尙肯源源供塞、致爲狀始終穩定、雖中途日銀行吸購現貨先令、而套出遠期、然而西商沙遜則塞出現貨、購納遠期、故無蒙影響、交易尙旺、港滙因雙方供求勢均、故亦無變、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均平紐的銀價依然呆定、倫教生金回漲半辦士、滙兌英對美·對滬·對法均無上落、美對英小〇六二五對滬仍平、對法跌〇六二五、中央掛牌、因逢革命政府成立紀念休假、故均無市、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金八辦士二五、美滙十六元〇六二五、較之前收均平、開後雖各大洋行互相扒結、兼華商投機家亦起大量吸收、但以滙豐等各外銀行供源尙旺、故無變化、計洋行與華商投機家相繼結進滙豐。麥加利現貨英金八辦士二五、繼之洋行又購進大通。華比現貨美滙十六元〇六二五、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅因中央銀行休業無市、此後日商銀行美來吸購現貨先令、而拋出遠期、然而西商沙遜則拋出現貨、購進遠期、故爲狀依然穩定、計日行進沙遜現貨英金八辦士二五、俄而日行即回吐予沙遜六月份英金八辦士一八七五、兼七月份英金八辦士五六二五、後沙遜又吸購外行本月份美滙十六元、近午外行賣予錢兌業現貨港匯五十五元七五與六二五、狀况亦頗平穩、迨午收銀行現貨賣價、芙美兩滙、與晨開相同、港滙五十五元六二五、</p>
<p>後市洋行結款轉稀豐故市勢愈形穩定豐計洋行結進英行滙豐現貨先令八辦士二五豐入後洋行扒結外行安達現貨港匯五十五元六二五、狀况亦鮮變化、迨晚收銀行現貨賣價、英匯八辦士二五、美滙十六元〇六二五、港滙五十五元六二五、結果較之隔昨晚收、均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊　各小一角</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美滙兌降零六二五、本埠外滙、洋行結款尙殷、銀行供給頗暢、市價穩定如前、烚赤開盤金號錢兌業供塞尙暢、客戶需要未盛、入後供求轉稀、波盪有限、午收微昂下午呆滯、交易未做開、外幣英美金鎊需要稍稀、價隨烚赤虛弱下降、英美金票、交易　盛、供給頗暢、美金票續趨鬆動、香港票供給、暢而下降、僅法郎票需要稍增微升、公會交易稀少、勤泰出鴻昌進美金鎊六十個、盈豐出鴻昌進美金鎊二十個、昨日市價、英美金鎊各降一角、美金票降一分、香港票降三釐、法郎票升一）毫半、共他各帮俱未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現續低拆息亦小</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、續稍軋低、但當日呈跌後小回勢、每千元上午初曾一度破入五十元內、但至午刻即回上至五十元、下午續升至五十元零二角半、比前日續小二角五分、錢業公會拆息亦已回小一分、計掛一角云、</p>

<h3>證券　外債回跌</h3>
<p>——墾殖股飛漲——</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月四日（星期四）掛牌行市上落五先令至一鎊不等、中法美金五厘公債有印　票及京滬鐵路公債各升半鎊、前者價爲六十四鎊、後者價爲二十五鎊午、費克斯飛機債票上升五先　價爲十七鎊半、克利斯浦公回跌一鎊、價爲三十六鎊、英續借款英發債票回跌半鎊、價爲六十六鎊半、廣九鐵路公價跌落五先令價爲十九鎊、餘無變動、英倫實貨供給、計有克利斯浦公債二千鎊售價三十七鎊、照市抬一鎊、</p>
<p>上海衆業公所股市非常堅挺而活動墾殖股成交最巨、因該公司宣佈派一九三八年末期利息四角、幷每五股派江利新股一股、以致股價漲至八元五角、後遇有多數獲利者拋出、回軟至八元三角五分、此價亦爲最後成交之價、如除去股息及紅股計算、該股則合爲六兀六角二分半、上海銀公司因有巨資投入於墾殖股、以致連帶漲至六元一角五分、怡和股賣買較爲疏忽、價格稍形下落、電車股及公共汽車股仍有投資者需求、瑞鎔普通股價七元四角、及耶松股價一百零六元、仍有需求、會德豐股再形堅挺成交卅六元半、橡皮股買戶較多、但價格低廉、少有股票出賣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　淺色布疋　街銷突旺</h3>
<p>東疋細布猛跌五角</p>
<p>昨日市面以實銷仍無進展之象、執貨戶頭、因市上有大批業內外散額囤戶、心神恍惚、市盤殊紊亂、小額成交、每疋降低一角之譜、大市趨勢仍平、蘇北·蚌埠·無錫等內地批發生意、尙稱良好、成交以淺色貨。漂布·府綢·標準布·白地花布·蔴紗·色丁等貨爲夥、的計二千餘疋、色布及白貨粗布·細布五十餘件、汕頭帮裝貨稍形恢復、惟新採辦仍殊寥寥、浙東溫州定海航運雖通、各客戶裝貨極寡、華北天津帮續辦府綢·條漂·色布·色斜·印花貨百餘箱、威海帮辦白貨粗布四五十件、　慶遭日機猛炸、川滇帮客戶進貨心思頗受影響、未成交各貨、暫緩訂購、閩帮以郵局停收郵包、辦貨亦停滯、本街門市生意因天時漸熱、淺色花布色丁蔴紗、交易突旺、以綸昌廠出品、最受人歡迎、六日有布疋二百二十件運往天津、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>白貨續軟、晨市細布·細斜售盤、被同業放空壓小、十二磅龍　細布一度慘跌至十四元、狂瀉四五角、嗣以本街染廠及多頭同業之拖拉、逐漸回升、晚市爲十四元三角半、較前日軋跌一角半、細斜亦降一角至二角、客帮生意、竟無人談起、蓋北帮吸納之貨、猶未消化、業外囤戶愈跌兪覺呆手、所以全日做開、祇本街同業與染廠八百餘件、但業內人心思、依然看高</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭左右紗市　櫙單價與現貨日近</h3>
<p>紗市跌風已戰、實需交易、寥若晨星、一般投機商依然看漲、在市拖進之籌碼、忽進忽出、異常忙碌、尙有同業中某某等皆在多頭地位、且吸收之額量殊巨、就以上情况論之各棧堆存之紗、雖屬滿坑滿谷、塞得水洩不通、市價越見昂漲至於實需雖滯不動、而裝運不能出口、售盤非但不鬆、反見一味前進、實則孤島囤藏者甚繁之故也、不過前昨兩日以來、市塲情形、成交以棧單為旺、可想虛浮交易多而實在銷路少、所以現貨與棧單價距離又近矣、午後實銷僅內地成交二十包、同行皮球交易一千零六十包、現紗晨初開盤、同業稍有觀望之心、市塲淸靜、客帮需要亦平常、呌賣者略盛、開價變馬棧單爲四百十五元半、比上日跌二元、現紗因客方無大納胃而較懈、少頃兜賣戶又擁、跌一元半、爲四百十四元、但現貨開價未見，此時市情平定、旋以市上收買者稍有、且某康字號進幾十包、於是風吹草動、喊買聲復起、成交甚少、互相呌高一二元、棧單價做到四百十七元半、現貨價爲四百二十二元五角、棧單與現貨價僅拔開五元、午後客銷安然乏勁、開盤平平、嗣後多說東洋紗價好、忽然提起二元、棧單價四百十九元、現紗價爲四百二十五元、全係同行成交、査全日各帮買去統計二千三百二十包、行情二十支雙馬紗漲一二元、天女疲一元、雙地球好三元、其餘漲二元光景、廠方由申新廠開出二十支天女五百包、價爲四百十元、五至六月、今日出口棉紗有九百五十件運天津、前日尙有紗頭五百三十二件運歐洲、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>
<p>同行一九八〇　香港六五　汕頭　一二〇內地　一五〇　厦門　五　統計二、三二〇</p>
<p>日紗市面氣勢稍定、因上月軋空之後、尙有許多戶頭手續迄今尙未辦理妥善、因之市場人頭大見减少、大有烏盡弓藏之象、二十支月琴上午價爲三百七十三五元、午後回昂一步、</p>
<h3>美棉出口津貼　勢成僵局</h3>
<p>印棉猛漲不已　本花交易沉悶</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初先因利物浦電告良好略漲、反對棉花出口津貼者日見增多、衆議院因此項提案未得三分之二上議員之同意、故拒不執行，近因棉銷略見好轉、値此新花尙未登場、而政府貸款棉未能放出、市市陳花日少、同業略有交易、引起漲風、昨日紐的近期好二磅音、遠期不動、印度連同預測漲三羅比、造成近三月來之新高價、埃及漲二十磅音、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每祖漲一角、印棉漲一元一角、埃及漲一元、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來漸見鬆動、惟昨日印棉猛漲、交易額略見遜色、然昨日各廠訂購亦共有五千包之數、內有巴西棉五百包、其織維以供紡二十支者爲大示、日廠亦購印棉三千包、皆係六月份裝船、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價列下、</p>
<p>本棉生意稍形起色、廠胃依然閉而不展、同業交易略增、故市價無大生色、但外棉售價、近日上漲、花號進出蛟繁、至於中外各廠、依然在市搜羅、印棉爲主體、因此本花交易、沉悶異常、然各路來源中斷、貨物缺乏、所以大勢情形、處於進退維谷之間、殆呈僵持之局面也、就以上狀况揣測、本年新棉如何情形、殊乏把握也、蘇北來通州花三百二十八包、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<h3>油餅　市傳豆油四千桶　尅日到埠</h3>
<p>生油自港轉滬　市氣頗受打擊</p>
<p>豆油市况、因傳途中淞浦丸裝運四千桶、尅日可抵、以致市氣萎疲、辦胃銳减、統市祇成交大連桶油五十桶、又白絞油三十桶、行情均開四十四元五角、又豐年油五十桶、四十三元五角、較上日續跌一元、</p>
<p>生油自港方轉運至滬以來、市氣頗受打擊、銷塲衹有本街等零星去化、交易亦乍起乍落、良以供過於求、致市易跌難漲、昨市交易、未曾做開、</p>
<p>邇來荳油價格、自去歲每担二十五六元、最高曾漲至四十七元之高峯、昨日記者晤及油業中人、詢其暴漲之原因、據稱自淞滬淪陷後、本市華商油廠、因原料斷絕、及淪陷區域工作困難、停頓者十之八九、即有一二華廠勉强開工、但所出貨量尙不能供市面十分一二、油商無可奈何、自去歲舊歷年初、即開始與日商交易、尙屬相安無事、詛至本年三月三十一日、本埠忽接大連來電、謂日方統制輸出、荳油亦在其列、於是來貨頓告阻斷、嗣悉日方對於荳油一項、雖可通融輸出、但須將日鈔改結先令、方准運滬銷售、但如改用先令、則每担之成本須達四十九元之鉅、惟木市油商向大連日商所定四五兩月之定貨、計達三萬餘桶之多、因此日商乃不的交貨、雖經本市油商向大連方面一再交涉、卒無要領、日商三井祇允解一成八厘、三菱解三厘八毫、尙有其他日商洋行則隻桶未交、於是本市油商對同行及內地油商之收解亦祇得採取折衷辦法、統扯以一成一厘交貨、本市油量乃供不應求、突呈猛漲之象、基上情形、實非油商囤積居奇、或對內地汕商故意違的、乃受日方統制並欲改用先令所造成之影響也、</p>
<h3>雜糧　生仁已有續到</h3>

<h3>向駐滬英法領署　請簽護照手續</h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>凡是到國外去游歷，或游學及經過第二國而到我國內地去的，第一步手續，就是應向我國發照機關請領出國護照，關於請領護照的手續，在本刊第二期內已經有詳細的記　，所以亦不必贅述了。現在所述的是在領得護照後向此間各國領事署請求加簽過境或入境簽字的手續。</p>
<p>（甲）法國</p>
<p>自從由香港轉入內地去的水陸交通斷絕以來，到內地去唯一的路徑是取道法屬安南，再循滇越鐵路至昆明，所以向法领署請求加簽經過越南的過境簽字的人，日見增加，該領署因爲請求的人過多，對與請求簽字時的手續亦見得嚴格了。其手續須將領得的護照，保證信（這信可用中文繕寫，由當地的殷實店舖或商號具名，內容大致寫些持照人的籍貫及職業，並且經濟充足，足以供給一切旅費，在越境如虞經濟缺乏困靴時，敝號敢爲擔保每人越幣一百元等云），照片兩張，（須與護照上所黏之照片相同者）牛痘及防疫證明書（須由英法工部局衛生處或徐新百醫生所出具者方爲有效）。以上各件都須面交法領署，並且還要在那兒塡寫申請單一紙，將護照及醫生證明及照片一紙帝下，其他保證信一封及照片一張，將由該署另備信封，由持照人送交法租界盧家灣巡捕房三樓政治部，由該部派員到保證人那裏去調杏後。如認爲合格，就報告法領署。領署方面　根據那報告簽給護照，過境簽字費爲十佛郞（的合國幣二元），辦理這簽字手續，的需二星期左右。假使，是到歐洲去游歷或游學而要經過法國，請求簽字則比較容易得多了。至於請求加簽入境簽字的手續大致與上面所述者略同，不過保證信一項是非常的認眞，如認爲不十分合格的時候，要命持照人預繳保證金越幣二百元。在日後離境時發還。簽字費爲七十五法郞，上述是指到法屬越南而言，到法國去游歷及讀書的則不在此例。</p>
<p>（乙）英國</p>
<p>請英領事署加簽護照，手續稍繁，設使是去讀書的，須由持照人畢業或曾肄業的母校校長，出具證明書，如有與英國學校往來信件，隨同帶往，對於到英國去讀書，就可以加一層證明，比較得妥善多多。至於經濟擔保一層，最好能具當地英商洋行經理或殷實店舖的經濟擔保信。入境簽字費爲英金十叫先令六辨士，請簽過境簽字是很簡便的，簽字費只需國幣三元左右，對於國人到英屬馬來羣島及其海峽殖民地去而要請求加簽護照時，本來祇要繳騐由目的地寄來的書信一封，就可以照簽。最近該領署因爲前去者日多，並且良莠不齊，所以重新頒佈加簽護照條規，自本年四月二十五日起已經實行，其條規大概情形如下：</p>
<p>（一）凡國人赴馬來羣島及其海峽殖民地者，均須先向英領署索塡申請書兩紙，照其規定格式逐項塡妥並須註明所往地保證人姓名，職業及地址以便調査。</p>
<p>（二）所塡申請書由該領寄往申請人所塡寫之所往地官廳前往調查，由該官廳據實報告，寄還此間領署，如認爲合格者，方允簽給護照。</p>
<p>（三）此項護照辦理時期來回需四星期，如欲求迅速者祇可用電報辦理，需時二星期，惟電報來往費用，均須由申請人先付，有餘退遠，不足補繳。</p>
<h3>港曼航空</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>英國帝國航空公司，擁有巨型水陸飛機數十架，陣容甚爲堅强，航綫幾遍及全球，有幹綫二條，南綫自倫敦啟飛至南菲洲德班（Durban）爲止，東綫自倫敦至澳洲悉尼（Sydeney）爲止。尙有支錢頗多，分發各地，今就其遠東支錢而言，該公司原有航綫係由香港至曼谷（Bangkok），近今鑒於由香港乘機至安南河內再轉往內地之旅客衆多，乃於本年叫月十四日起，每星期五由港飛曼谷之飛機中途在越南河內停留。其票偕單程爲英金九鎊來回十六鎊，與法國航空公司同價，自本年五月一日起該公司對於原訂票價，實行增價，其新訂票價單程爲英金十四鎊，來回廿五鎊，由河內至香港，其票價以法郞計算，單程二五〇佛郞，來回四五〇〇佛郞。免費行李仍爲廿五公斤，逾量每公斤爲一先令五辨士，其票價雖已增加，惟旅客因該公司機型巨大，更加安全舒適，故仍樂於乘坐，該公司每逢星期五啟飛之飛機僅有機座三位以供赴越旅客乘坐。以是凡擬乘該公司飛機由港赴越者，應於啟程前一星期向該公司預定，否則恐不能得座位也。又按法國航空公司港越錢之價目，現仍照原價發售，尙無增價消息云。</p>

<h3>翻造與遷讓</h3>
<p>— （張鎭山）</p>
<p>目前上海房屋地產的價値及其供求兩方面難以適當調配的困難，已進化到了一種相當駭人的程度，而因此所產生的租賃的磨擦，也由單純性的二房東，三房客而進化到了集體性的糾紛。大房東和全體房客之間的利害衝突，近來已如風起雲湧；這幾天喧騰於報章的翻造興遷讓問題，有的泣告哀懇，有的呼籲求援，有的託入調解，有的訴諸法律，有的電行政院以謀救濟，也有的經調解圓滿而登報鳴謝的，眞是不一而足。</p>
<p>這些現象產生的根本原因何在？一言以蔽之：屋少人多而已。在租界一隅，已擁居了近五百萬人，而其中由各處投奔而來的小資產階級也多；他們只求有屋安身，代價高昂也無妨，再加上業主的投機，以致於造成了租價上空前的高昂紀錄，允其以「頂費」，「外用」之類爲最，動輒千數，亦不爲奇；於是乎，業主們的生財之道，就無形產生，而同時，其方法和方式也無形在進步。</p>
<p>我們根據這種現實的情况爲論斷的據點，以客觀的態度來說，大房東所以要翻造，並不是爲了房屋陳舊，不堪居住，也不是爲了市容的觀瞻所繫，其目的是在增加資本的生產；而房客的不願遷讓，不是故意留難，也不是迷戀該屋，實在是因爲無屋可遷。</p>
<p>最近我聽到熟悉內幕的人說：現在一幢房屋的翻造，非但不必費本，而且新租金的收入還可達到超出舊租金一倍以上之目的。譬如：一幢現在租八十元一月的房屋，費一千數百元去翻造：那末，在翻造之後，按月租價可抬高至二百元（內部設備較完善的尙不化此數），同時，還可向租戶收取數額等於造價的「小費」。在人滿爲患的目前情况下，雖以這様的方式出租，而一般人還是趨之若騖，甚至屋未落成，就宣告「客滿」。這樣一來，不是很輕易的按月增加了一百二十元租金嗎？（其他方式還多）試問，若不翻造，遽爾加租，要加到這個數字，非但事實上不可能，而且人情、常理、輿論各方面都不會允許。所以，業主一旦起了翻造的主意，任你怎様泣告，怎樣跪求，形狀怎樣狼狽可憐，都是無濟於事的，因爲一般人的心目中就只有錢，主權在手，流離失所自然是別人的事；現實社會中祗有同階級而同環境者才有同情，這似乎已成了定律。</p>
<p>觀乎找屋的困難，我們要勸一般人，設若遇到房屋翻造而必須遷讓時，似乎不必作等於與虎謀皮的懇求，也不必作空洞的「請社會人士援助」，還是趁早自己打算；小資產階級的「逃難」，不一定要在「孤島」上逃，內地就是很好的去處，無論那裏可以安身。房尾像上海這様的難找，房屋租價像上海這様高昂，那是絕對沒有的事，假使一般逃難上海的人都移轉方向逃到內地去，那末，自己旣受不着房束的威脅，而上海地方也就自然而然的，沒有因翻造與遷讓問題而產生的社會不安的現象了。</p>
<h3>「孤島」的恐怖</h3>
<p>— 馬戈作</p>
<h3>「三朶花」觀感</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Three　Smart　Girls　Grow　Up”</p>
<p>「三朶花」是「滿庭芳」的續集，狄安娜竇萍已經從「滿庭芳」而單戀過茂文陶格拉斯（荳蔻年華），和她同年齡的南葛蘭，海倫派麗舒，自然也「長成「得像花」一般了，所以這部滿庭芳」的續集「三朶花」中，告訴了我們比「荳蔻年華」更「艷情」的故事。</p>
<p>在狄安娜賽萍誕辰的宴會中，大姊南葛蘭宜布與理杳訂婚，然而二姊海倫派麗舒却失戀了。狄安娜竇萍在音樂院中拉來了一位美少年哈雷，她的本意是介紹給二姊的。哈雷却沒有懂得她的「苦心孤詣，和大姊表示愛慕之忱。這錯綜局面的發展，終於由狄安娜的向父親痛陳利害，將錯就錯，完成了「氤氳大使」的使命。在這個艷情故事中，劇作者果然有一點企圖告訴天下之父母，應該隨時注意他們的兒女，盡敎育之職；但是「三朶花」在導演亨利柯斯德的支持之下，這僅有的企圖也像泡沬一様的消散了，當父親對他們的職員說「你回家去留意你的兒女們」這一句話，完全在全片輕快，活潑的「氤氳工作」中掩滅了。</p>
<p>現在且將亭利柯斯德的得意之筆，的述如下：（一）他在幕表後面介紹了「三朶花」出場之後，就展開了狄安娜竇萍的誕辰宴會，在這宴會中他各方面的介紹了狄安娜的歌喉；大姊的訂婚；二姊的悲愴；父親的專心於他的事業，在這様熱閙的一場戲中，他提綱地爲全片劃了個淸楚的輪廓，這處理方法是很好的。（二）以後狄安娜竇萍在音樂院中的邀請哈雷到家晚膳；哈雷赴宴：及最後的桔婚那場戲，也都處理得活潑而風趣，而且面面週到，不愧爲喜劇的導演聖手。（三）對於父親（却爾斯溫尼格）和狄女娜竇萍的性格也抓得很緊：如在誕辰宴會中，父親遲到，看見客人濫敷衍，忘了脫外套，換了禮服之後又忘了鞋子；哈雷赴宴那場戲中，他脫了外套，又穿上哈雷的外套，和幾决狄安娜和他談話的時候，他都忙着事業上的電話等等，把一個專心於事業，而不問其他的人物寫得眞實而可愛。狄安娜竇萍的天眞活潑，是她的特點，亨利柯斯德是更强調了她的少女的心，如知道大姊的訂婚，她快活得什麼似的逢人告訴「大姊訂婚了！」介紹哈雷和大姊見面時，她告訴他「她已經訂婚了！」對於少女的心是描寫得很透徹的。（四）描寫三姊妹的手足之情：如狄安娜竇萍偷看二姊燒毀日記：竭力替二姊和哈雷拉場；姊妹聯床共話；及誤會狄安娜愛戀哈雷後三姊妹的泣哭等等，也很動人。</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍的叫支歌，在我外行聽來，都沒有以　的好</p>
<h3>猶太人的樂園</h3>
<p>— 夏洛</p>
<p>在蘇聯的第一張彩色片「夜鶯曲」（現在是改名呌「女壯士」了）之前，我們看到了一張很難得的新聞片：「猶太人的自治區」。</p>
<p>提起猶太人，我們是不會忘記他們是被視爲劣等民族而爲希特勒們虐殺着的。這一批亡國之民，被侮辱與被損害是成爲家常便飯了，他們的生命財產之被入破壞，也成了「理所當然」，理由就是因爲他們是猶太人。</p>
<p>然而這一批沒有祖國的人民，在世界的某一個角落裹，在蘇聯的领土中，他們却有一個自治區，這個自治區是我們的近隣，就在我們的黑龍江國境對面。在那裏，他們是允許着說他們自己的話的，他們在那裏耕田做工也開採金礦，他們用他們的勞力和智力去向大地索算報酬，他們已不必憂慮隨時隨地的被襲擊，因爲這裹是屬於他們自治的土地</p>
<p>看了這樣的新聞片，我們是有怎樣的感想呢？流浪在世界各國，被各民治國家的好意所收留的猶太難民看了會有怎樣的感想呢？上海的猶太難民在看了這張新聞片之後，在他們自己辦的報紙上是表示心嚮往之。</p>
<p>我不是猶太人，然而當看到那些在和平的空氣（那是有蘇聯的無比的威力所保護着的）中孜孜地過活的人民，却也禁不住心嚮往之，由之，也連想到我們正在墾植開拓中的西南和西北的墾植區，在那裏，我們的同胞是也正以加倍的辛勞在建築我們的樂園。名新聞攝影師佐立斯伊文與赫勃克倫攝製的「四萬萬同胞」（一部忠實的紀錄我國抗戰的新聞片）中，有沒有這些畫面呢？</p>
<p>安好和平的人民是雖在血雨腥風中也不會忘掉建築他們和平的田園的，雖然他們也不會忘記用武力來保衛他們的田園，而世界上一切愛和平的人民携起手來，則更是防止侵略者闖入的不二法門。</p>
<p>伸出我們友誼的手來，向黑龍江的彼岸，我們的近隣表示誠摯的友情，你們歷盡壓迫的經歷，是最明白法西者的殘酷，是祇有以打擊者予打擊才能對付的。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>大家以爲這班過慣了奢華生活的明星戲劇家，是吃不來苦的。誰知他們明日就組織了許多演劇隊，情願拋棄了上海的一切，準備流很到全國各處，喚起人民　抗戰情緒。這位金先生，他們所組織的是救亡演劇第二隊，帶領了男女演員，倒有十七八人。這時上海有個文化界救亡協會，在協會之下，有種種集團，而演劇隊也是一種。那種演劇隊，都是出發到內地去的，這金先生的）隊，每人只湊集了五塊錢作旅費，　雇了小船，偷倫地沿蘇州河離開了上海。這十七八人中，男的女的，大藥生也有，工界中人也有，有詩人，有漫畫家，有攝影師，不過現在總是一個劇團了。他們到一處地方，就演起戲來，不論都市，不論鄕村。都市裏自然還可以借一個劇塲或者有處公共地方，可以演出。若是鄉村，有許多是在荒陬僻壤之間，他們也可以隨便因就地的演起戲來。他們各處周游，從江蘇，山東，安徽，河南，湖南，湖北，江西，廣西，經過了八省，公演了七百幾十次。有時翻山越嶺。竟是要步行走幾百里路，還要自已揹　鋪蓋，到一處地方，沒有可以安睡的地方，就是打地鋪。吃的東西，有了大餅油條，已經算是很好的了。男人倒也不去管他，還有女人，當時與這位余先生在一個演劇隊裹的，有一位王女士，她本來是位嬌貴的小姐，曾在日本留過學，文學也是很好的。在中國電影界裏，也是一位著各的明星，自然服裝必求漂亮，起居定要　華的。可是到了這個時候，她也能穿了老粗布的衣服，有時爲了翻山越嶺，爲荊棘所抓破，打了幾個補釘的衣服，也穿了出來，不以爲奇了。這可以見得一個人的志氣，倘然向大處高處着想，那些細微裝飾等事，眞不足掛念。他們到一處，便演一回戲，到了工人齊集的地方，便演戲給工人照。像到了大冶礦山那裏，便演給礦工們看，盡義務不要一個大錢。到了大別山的地方，便演戲給游擊隊的弟兄們看。有時候，他們演劇隊在半路上遇見了從前綫運輸回來的傷兵，他們就在半路上，簡單化妝一下，演幾個短劇給他們看。（一〇二）</p>

<p>— 渴雲樓主</p>
<p>日前偶顧黃金，聆珠塵女史之「釵叫鳳」劇，此劇本爲留香館主得意之作，前蒞春申，嘗數度往觀，哀感頑艷，令人迥腸盪氣，此决珠塵參以程腔，婉轉歌來，又覺風趣別具，描寫劇中人一生遭　，可謂淋漓盡致，收穫之佳，出人意外，愛拉雜書來，以供同好。</p>

<h3>查瑞龍倦游歸來</h3>
<p>— 復錚</p>
<p>他　僑胞愛國……如海潮澎湃</p>
<p>說　堅決抗戰……獻金更踴躍</p>
<p>早年中國影界的武俠明星，大力士査瑞龍，他的名字想爲人們所熟識，前年他率領國光藝術團到菲島去表演，現在倦遊歸來，中間曾爲祖國，向華僑宣傳並義務表演募集款項，很盡一下力，作者最近與他晤談一過，下面便是簡短的筆錄：</p>
<p>菲島獻技</p>
<p>査君在南洋是很有些名聲的，他到過暹邏，新加坡等地，而這次遠遊菲列濱羣島，因國光藝術團技術歌舞的精彩，博得各該地華僑和外人的歡迎，歷時年餘，方始歸來，以視魏縈波等之不得志於異域，查君及共旅伴亦很足以自慰了</p>
<p>爲國宣勞</p>
<p>當査君在各地獻技之時，感於國難當頭，爲國民者應如何克盡其能替祖國做一些有益的工作，因之隨時向觀衆宣傳抗戰，並義務表演十餘决，所得收益，完全交由華僑抗敵會，呈獻祖國作救濟傷兵難民之用，査君談起華僑愛國心之熱烈，乃如海潮之澎湃，他們踴躍輸將，有助於祖國抗戰渚極大。</p>
<p>熱帶珍品</p>
<p>他平素是酷嗜蓄養熱帶魚的，這次他身歷其地，每至海濱湖沼着意尋覓，爲時旣久獲得的魚族，水草，活的小螺，螺壳及海底奇石等非常豐富。此次歸來，這些熱帶珍品爲他的行囊生色不少。另有水草數種，都是上海所不曾見過的；左旋螺十餘枚，色分紫，咖啡及玉色，普通螺屬皆係右旋，故此種左旋螺彌覺珍貴，螺壳及海底奇石有百餘種之多，而其形狀色澤各不相同；更有玉色孔雀魚一對，通體透明，現正在受孕時期，腹中小魚的眉目歷歷可見，這眞是極自然界之奇妙了。最近的將來，查君預備將所獲珍品借一適當地點作義務之公開展覽，以供養魚同志的參考。</p>
<h3>查瑞龍的體魄</h3>
<p>舞國寫影</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>誰之罪惡（下）</h3>
<p>諺云，種瓜得瓜，種豆得一旦，舞女和舞客們的自殺與涉訟事件，究竟是那一方面的種因呢？記得有一决在卡爾登看一齣名呌花濺淚的話劇，內容大概描寫</p>
<p>（一二）一個當舞女的咪咪，受一個闊舞客的欺給，幾至自殺，這咪咪一角，似乎是由藍蘭扮演的，表得相當緊張，台下很有些女客在掉淚，也許有一部份是舞女吧。當時路明坐在我後面，恨的牙癢癢地，琴芳却態度安閒，鏗然則與我談些編劇的技巧。我說，你們三人一様看戲，却是三副眼光，他們說，你呢，我倒一時回答不出了。我覺得這編劇者的意思，大概認爲一班大腹賈式的舞客，大都是仗着有幾個臭錢而玩弄女性的，不用說，這罪惡是他們所造成的了，可憐那懂得愛情的窮學生，他們又沒有錢，那爲衣食驅迫的天眞女孩子，她們是不得已而當舞女，一時被金錢虛榮迷惑住了，就難免一場不幸的結果，這劇作者的思想，不能算錯。</p>
<p>不過話又得說回來，我們若在目由平等的原則上看呢，自由的意義是可以盡量發揮自己的能力，以求償自己的願望，但以不侵犯他人之自由爲主要條件，這不侵犯就是不强迫，就是要得到對方的同意。怎様能不强迫得到對方的同意呢，必定要站在平等的基礎上，以相當的義務，換取對方相當的權利，換言之，舞客所盡的義務，即是舞女所享受的權利，舞客所享受的權利，也是舞女所盡的義務。照普通一般情形看來，我們赤裸裸大胆地說，簡直是舞客在犧牲着自己或祖宗的血汗換來的錢，舞女在犧牲着自己及父母遺留的靈與肉。我們不應用片面的觀察來評斷，倘若舞客們不應用錢的勢力去誘惑舞女，那末舞女們爲什麼要用色的引誘來蠱惑舞客呢？所以我們對於社會上發生一種惡果，必須用一種持平的眼光，就雙方面來觀察，來尋究其所以然的原因。所謂執其兩端，用其中於明，我們可以說，這罪惡是雙方所造成的，至於所以造成這罪惡的原因，一種是只顧自己，不顧對方，一種是連自己都沒有顧到；屬於前者是貧，屬於後者是痴，因爲貪，所以要涉訟，因爲痴，所以要自殺，貪痴的結果都是嗔，嗔了就要發生惡果了</p>
<p>最後，要勸勸一般舞客們，化錢尋樂，原沒有什麽不應該，所謂交易而退，各得其所，自己切莫留連忘返，對人切莫虛言哄騙，（譬如已娶妻的說尚未結婚等等）千萬記着不要使她發生沒趣的後果。同時要勸勸一般舞女們，關於同人發生關係的一節，總要千萬審愼，要曉得客人的心理，你若不和任何人發生關係，比較你隨便任何人祇要有錢都可以發生關係，恐怕還是對前者肯長流水的化錢呢。所以守身如玉，決不會影響到你職業上的收入的，祇不要化錢的人擺架子，不化錢的人做傻子罷了。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>民國後伶人身價抬高的原國</p>
<p>似這等隆重大典中，若干萬的士兵官佐，不用說一律都穿着制服軍裝，就連閱兵台上的高級將領，也須穿起將官的禮服，佩帶着勳章指揮刀等，其中就單單立着一位漂亮文弱而且穿起長袍馬褂的花旦程硯秋，衆目睽睽之下，比起那些赳赳武夫來，就格外顯得他如同出水芙渠一樣的鮮艷了。張氏爲要留一永久紀念計，並且還同他合攝了一張照片，這事後來傳到津滬各地，都說長腿將軍過於藐視國家的法度，視閱兵大典同兒戲一般，一面復責硯秋，究竟是個小孩子，甚麽全不懂，也跟着鬍匪出身的直魯軍閥任意胡鬧。其實正是因爲北伐前的軍關政客，目無國紀，瞎閙瞎捧，才把伶人的身價抬高。這與弟三項所述寗方官佐之捧孫菊仙，又大不相同，孫氏以古稀之年，自津遠來，爲北省災民演戲籌款，他的爲人，他的居心，都是很可敬，很可捧的。所以捧人須有可捧的道理，伶人身價抬高，更當有應當抬高的原因。現在各級社會人皆須享受平等待遇，劇藝界擔負着輔導與推行社會敎育的重責，例如周信芳等不但他能深切了解藝人的職責，同時也能切知戲劇與社會民族的關係，他固然很看重了自己，而社會人士誰父不同様的看重了他呢。所以周君身價的抬高，又與孫菊仙的僅以慈善爲懷，似乎又高出多多了。最可笑的就是有一輩人呌軍閥政客們，把他們別有用心的極力捧紅啦，因而他們自己也以爲是身價抬高，可以隨便向別人發威啦，這種事適足以顯示其愚不可及。下面所舉的，就是這個例子。</p>
<p>（五）交通總長吳毓麟常在尚小雲私寓批閱公文四大名旦中的尚小雲，善於交際，允好與軍政要人往還，當時順天時報的日人迂聽花及交通總長吳毓麟，都是小雲的義父，所以每値他登台之日，總可以一看見一位手握酒瓶，一面自斟自飲，一面一怪聲呌好的日人。－（四）－</p>

<p>Chongqing Suffers Bombing for Several Consecutive Days</p>
<h3>President Chiang Kai-Shek Most Earnestly Encourages Civil Servants to Dedicate Themselves to Relief Work, Mobilize Manpower and Resources to Implement Emergency Measures, Appoints He Yingqin to be Fully Responsible for Directing Everything, and Controls Public and Private Ships and Vehicles for Free Transportation of Refugees</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The city has been bombed by Japanese planes for several consecutive days, causing casualties and displacement among citizens. The President deeply sympathizes with them and took the opportunity of the Fifth Fifth Commemoration Meeting on the 5th to encourage all party, government, and military personnel to dedicate themselves to the evacuation and relief of refugees. After the commemoration meeting, he summoned the heads of various party, government, and military organs to discuss mobilizing manpower and resources to implement emergency measures. It was decided that: (1) Fire lanes should be opened up and implemented as soon as possible; (2) All public and private vehicles and ships should be concentrated to transport refugees; (3) The government should quickly allocate large sums of money to handle all rescue and relief matters, and officials above the rank of recommended-appointment civil servants and above the rank of colonel military officers of all party, government, and military organs should donate at least one month's salary for the relief of suffering citizens; (4) All members of the city, members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, civil servants, and various soldiers should be mobilized to assist in defense and relief work. The President appointed Chief of Staff He Yingqin to be fully responsible for directing everything. Chief of Staff He then consulted with the heads of relevant agencies and decided on a number of measures, with the evacuation of the elderly, weak, women, and children from the urban area being a top priority. It was decided to control public and private ships and vehicles for free transportation, and all vehicles of various agencies would be deployed, with personnel assigned to take care of them at refugee gathering points. (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Japanese planes attacked Chongqing on the 3rd and 4th, dropping a large number of incendiary bombs indiscriminately. Fires broke out in many places in the city, spreading rapidly and causing many civilian houses to be burned down. Various consulates and foreign cultural institutions, as well as foreign residences, were also affected. According to investigations, the German Consulate in Chongqing was burned down by incendiary bombs. The French Consulate in Chongqing and the British Consulate were also bombed, causing damage to some parts. The Zhenyuan Church Notre Dame Cathedral in France and the refugee shelter attached to it were also bombed and collapsed, resulting in the deaths of no less than a hundred refugees sheltered there. Several foreign residences on Tianguan Street were also burned down. (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to military reports received here today, the Japanese naval air force, led by Major Izasa, bombed various military organs in Chongqing again yesterday, including the air defense headquarters and the Military Affairs Commission. More than ten fires broke out throughout the city. The anti-aircraft artillery team near the consular district in the western suburbs of Chongqing fired fiercely, but the Japanese planes immediately returned fire and silenced them. Four Chinese fighter planes engaged the Japanese planes, but the Japanese planes repelled the Chinese planes and returned to their base. The Japanese planes saw two Douglas-type aircraft, one light bomber, and eight fighter planes parked at a certain airfield upstream of Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<h3>Consular Areas Also Hard to Escape</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese planes bombed Chongqing arbitrarily last night. The affected area was one and a half miles long and 500 yards wide. The British and French consulates were hit. The British Consulate building was damaged in several places, and the private residence of the British Vice Consul was also affected. Tai Hegeding, secretary to British Ambassador Kerr, was slightly injured. Although the official has not yet announced the exact number of casualties, observers estimate that the number of deaths and injuries will reach as many as 3,000, as the Japanese planes dropped bombs in commercial centers and residential areas. Several foreign churches were burned down, and dozens of buildings collapsed. Dozens of foreigners fled in panic. The severity of this air raid is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war. One bomb hit a Canadian school and immediately caught fire, burning fiercely. The Canadian Friends Service was also affected and burned down. The German Embassy also caught fire, but was saved from disaster thanks to the efforts of the fire brigade. The residence of Walgiss, a Greek salesman for the Allied Aircraft Parts Company, was bombed, and Walgiss escaped death. After the air raid ended, the Associated Press reporter went to inspect the disaster area and saw severed limbs, a gruesome sight. Various rescue organizations bravely came out to provide relief. When the reporter arrived near the Canadian Friends Service building, he witnessed eight children, all under the age of ten, with their limbs separated, a tragic sight that brought tears to his eyes. Doctors were busy treating the injured and refused to release the exact number of injured. When the reporter arrived at a certain place, a wall suddenly collapsed, burying at least fifteen people, including civilians and firefighters. The reporter was fortunate to dodge quickly, otherwise he would have been a victim of the air raid. The fire spread rapidly due to the wind. Fortunately, the fire brigade fought bravely to put out the fire, so it was extinguished by morning. The Central News Agency and the International Radio Station were bombed, so communication between Chongqing and the outside world was completely cut off for a time. The power and telephone lines were also cut off, and the north bank of the Yangtze River became a dark world. (Associated Press dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<h3>The Tragic Scene After the Bombing is Too Horrific to Witness</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Japanese planes came to bomb again yesterday evening. Non-official sources estimate that there were between 1,500 and 3,000 deaths and injuries. At night, more than 200,000 residents of Chongqing left the city one after another. The Sino-Japanese war has lasted for twenty months, and no Chinese city has suffered more from bombing disasters than Chongqing. Wooden houses with weak structures were mostly completely destroyed. Even the British Consulate, where British Ambassador Kerr is currently renting, suffered considerable damage. Chinese civilians who took refuge in the open space of the British Consulate were also inevitably killed or injured, with 25 dead and 50 injured. Tai Holding, the British Ambassador's secretary, who came to Chongqing from Shanghai with the British Ambassador, was injured by falling bricks while holding brandy for the injured. The German Embassy was on fire on both sides and was almost burned down. More than 100 people were seen dying in the fire, but people in the embassy could not provide assistance. The evacuation of Chongqing residents began after yesterday's air raid and is still continuing today. The tragic scene of displacement that comes with war is truly shocking. The Central News Agency was also among those destroyed. President Xiao Tongzi and Editor-in-Chief Chen Bosheng were in the agency at the time of the air raid and escaped from the rubble afterward, fortunately unharmed. Business Director Li Yaoqing was seriously injured and is feared to be beyond saving. Manager He Shuyuan was also seriously injured. The metropolis that was full of life a few days ago is now almost a wasteland. At least 200,000 people have fled overnight, leaving behind only ruined walls, rubble, and a desolate scene. Water, electricity, and telephone services have all been cut off. President Chiang issued an order last night that all newspapers in Chongqing cease publication and that a joint newspaper be published. Therefore, except for two extra editions this morning, no newspapers were published. Mr. Tai Holding, who was injured at the British Consulate, was escorted to the British gunboat HMS Eagle by a team of British and American sailors for medical treatment. According to unconfirmed reports, the British Embassy staff and the British Consulate will move to the south bank to work. President Chiang and his wife inspected the bombed area twice last night and this morning. To quickly evacuate civilians, President Chiang ordered last night that all public and private cars and trucks be requisitioned to transport the refugees to the countryside. All requisitioned vehicles were concentrated at designated locations at 11:00 this morning and began to head to the countryside. The President's wife personally supervised the evacuation of refugee children, and the relief workers of the New Life Movement and various women's organizations were busy preparing food and accommodation along the way for the refugees. The main street of Chongqing, Xiaoliangzi (transliteration), caught fire last night and has not been extinguished as of this afternoon. The fire spread, and the Central Daily News building was also threatened. The fire brigade not only had difficulty providing rescue due to the interruption of water supply, but also because the disaster area was too wide and the fire spread very quickly, they could not effectively extinguish the fire despite their best efforts. Currently, the cost of crossing the river by boat has increased dramatically by 400 times due to the large number of people. Previously, it only cost 1.5 cents, but now it costs 6 yuan. Looking at the fire in Chongqing from the river last night, the tragic scene was no less than the fire in Zhabei in November of the year before last. Although the residents of Chongqing are evacuating rapidly today, the military and police are maintaining excellent order in the city, which has won the praise of foreigners. The American Methodist Hospital located on the hilltop is safe and sound. The house where the American couple Mr. and Mrs. Fant lived has been burned down, but the Fants are both safe. Many Americans in Chongqing, most of whom are clergy, are now safe. A senior Chinese official criticized the air raids of the past two days, saying that the air raid on Wednesday could still be called the bombing of a military target, but last night's attack was purely an act of terror, as the bombs were dropped in the city's downtown area. As for the bombing of the consular area, it is undoubtedly undeniable, as the consulates are located on the highest hilltop in Chongqing and should not be mistaken even in the air at night, especially since the visibility was very clear during yesterday's bombing. Currently, the British diplomatic personnel in Chongqing include British Ambassador Sir Kerr, Chargé d'affaires Bai Longni, Ambassador's Private Secretary Tai Holding, Honorary Attache Weisituomake, First Secretary Green Cheng, Consul General Toller, Vice Consul McGann Qi, and Secretary Holmes.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The European Situation and the Baltic Sea</h3>
<p>The Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been delayed for a long time, and now they will inevitably suffer a setback due to the departure of Litvinov; Germany's ambitions for the Baltic Sea may be even more advanced as a result. Originally, Hitler was drooling with desire, demanding the return of Danzig from Poland, and suggesting to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland that they conclude non-aggression treaties. Danzig is an important port on the Baltic coast, and if Hitler wants to expand his influence in the Baltic countries and seize their abundant raw materials, he must first start by occupying Danzig; at the same time, in order to prevent future troubles when occupying Danzig, he has to use the permission for Finland to build fortifications on the Aaland Islands as bait to lure Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to conclude non-aggression treaties with him, in order to cut off the Soviet Union's access to the Baltic Sea. Now, Polish Foreign Minister Beck has made a speech in the Lower House rejecting Hitler's demands; while Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland are scheduled to hold a meeting in Copenhagen on the 9th of this month to discuss Hitler's suggestions.</p>
<p>The Baltic Sea is located in northeastern Europe. Although the area is not very large, the countries surrounding it are all agricultural countries with abundant raw materials. Therefore, it has always been regarded as an outer province by European industrial countries. Before the Great War, it was dominated by Britain, Germany, and Russia; after the Great War, five emerging countries, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, were established around it. These countries were born out of the so-called "national self-determination" principle of the Treaty of Versailles; at the same time, it was hoped that with these countries, the struggle around the Baltic Sea could be calmed down. However, the reality is exactly the opposite of expectations.</p>
<p>Although Finland and other countries gained liberation and independence thanks to the Russian October Revolution of 1917, after their establishment, they joined Britain and France and served as pioneers against the Soviet Union. Poland was also originally a partner of France. After Hitler came to power in 1933, France felt the pressure from across the Rhine and changed its policy, becoming friendly with the Soviet Union, while Poland adopted a pro-German policy. Since then, the European anti-Soviet struggle has been led by Britain. Thus, with Britain's indulgence, Germany expanded its influence in northeastern Europe in many ways under the slogan of anti-Sovietism. In order to counter this situation, the Soviet Union concluded non-aggression treaties with Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to reduce Germany's threat to it. However, Hitler's power in the Baltic Sea continued to grow day by day. Now that he has annexed Memel, he is also trying to annex Danzig and demands to build a highway in the Polish Corridor to connect Germany with the Baltic Sea, in order to expand his influence in Northern Europe from there. Not only that, but he also uses the permission for Finland to build fortifications on the Aaland Islands as bait to lure the four Nordic countries into concluding non-aggression treaties. The Aaland Islands are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia and are of great military and commercial value, because by controlling the island, one can control the outlet for Northern European trade and transportation. In 1922, the League of Nations decided not to allow fortifications. Therefore, if this conspiracy is realized, not only will Poland's survival and independence be at stake, but Britain's interests in Northern Europe and the security of Soviet Russia's western border will be greatly threatened.</p>
<p>We must judge the evolution of this situation as Britain's own fault from a certain point of view; in other words, the initial leadership of the anti-Soviet policy and the subsequent playing with the collective security system are the main factors that led to this situation. Recently, British policy has indeed changed, but it failed to complete the task of organizing an anti-aggression group during Litvinov's tenure. Whatever the reason, it cannot but be judged as a failure of British diplomacy. However, it remains to be seen: the failure of British diplomacy does not mean the success of the diplomacy of the aggressor countries; the departure of Litvinov does not mean a change in Soviet policy; Germany deliberately expresses joy, but the opposite is true, because ambition has increased, another opportunity for piecemeal destruction has arrived, and the conflict of interest with Britain and the Soviet Union has become sharper. Finland and other countries will never be willing to throw themselves into Germany's arms unless it is proven that Britain and the Soviet Union are willing to abandon themselves.</p>

<h3>Shantou Bombed Again Yesterday - City Area Stra fed by Low-Flying Aircraft - Many Civilian Casualties - British and French Churches Also Affected</h3>
<p>Shantou: Shantou was bombed yesterday. Today, Japanese planes flew in again to fiercely bomb the city center. The Japanese planes also descended rapidly, strafing with machine guns. Civilians on the streets were greatly alarmed, and there were many casualties. The exact number is yet to be investigated. Rescue personnel are busy rescuing the injured and removing bodies. The British escort vessel HMS Falmouth, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, is now docked in Shantou.

<p>came and went in haste, deeply regretting not having the opportunity to hear his teachings and express accumulated feelings. As I took my leave, he finally informed me that he was going to Hong Kong to advocate for a major plan regarding war and peace. I was stunned, but then solemnly replied that both advocating for war and advocating for peace were for the sake of the nation, but this matter was of great importance, and no matter what, I urged him to focus on the facts. Although it was only a brief word, it came from my sincere heart. However, due to the hurried departure, I could not fully express what was on my mind, and I have been concerned ever since. Fortunately, Mr. Gongbo arrived and repeatedly showed sincerity. My stubborn opinion was that even if advocating for peace was unavoidable, one should always consider the overall situation and respect the facts, so as to avoid causing major domestic disputes and betraying your original intention of saving the country. I asked him to convey my thoughts to those around him, and Mr. Gongbo presumably did so. However, when you arrived in Hanoi, you suddenly issued a public telegram advocating [something], which shocked and surprised observers from all sides. At that time, various parties rose up to criticize and misunderstand you. I still believed that you were determined to save the country and that your motives were pure, and I did not doubt that there were any hidden reasons, which would eventually be understood by others. Therefore, I did not join in the criticism, which led to speculation about me from the outside world. When the unfortunate incident in Hanoi occurred and Zhongming died tragically, I mourned his loss. As Yunnan and Vietnam are close, even though you reported that you were safe, I still sent Director Li Hongmo to offer condolences. Then I received a reply from you, dated "the 30th of last month," attached with an example article from a Hong Kong newspaper. I read it over and over again, and I was deeply astonished and shocked. I realized that although I knew you, you did not know me, and although I loved you, you could not love me with virtue. I am truly filled with fear and regret. In the example article, state secrets were leaked to both domestic and foreign parties and made known to the enemy. This is already not permitted by the basic national ethics of the people. As for the letter you sent, it wanted me to betray the Party and the country, undermine unity, and destroy the price of national sacrifice, violating the national policy upheld by the whole country. What kind of matter is this? It not only sacrifices the future of our nation, but also plunges countless soldiers and civilians into an abyss of eternal suffering. This talk of peace and saving the country is simply inviting destruction. I have served in the military for twenty years, following Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek for many years. In the past, when conflicts arose between the North and the South, the reason why I always maintained the central government without any deviation was to complete unification and lay the foundation for resisting the enemy and building the nation. This has been consistent throughout history, and my resolve will not change. Even if I do not cherish my own history, how can I betray my country, and how can I bear to betray all the comrades who have struggled hard and sacrificed so tragically? Where conscience lies, even with extreme caution, I cannot but deeply regret that you do not know me, and I cannot but feel pain and fear for your future. The way we conduct ourselves should be upright and aboveboard. The fleeting opinions of the world, even if they are not understood for a time, are not worth dwelling on. However, one must never be driven by emotions to provide resources to the enemy and forever ruin one's life. The words in your letter not only show that you should not expect this from me, but also that I do not want you to be swayed by temporary anger and fall into a thorny situation. Carefully examining the contents of your letter, it must not be the original intention when you left Chongqing. But if you act rashly without choosing, and never return, who will understand you in future generations? For your sake, at this time, do not be moved by anger, do not be deceived by those around you, eliminate desires, and restore your spiritual nature. Then your intentions may still be understood on the day of victory in the war of resistance. Please make a firm decision, absolutely sever all ties with the enemy, travel far away, and take a temporary rest, cut off all entanglements to avoid being manipulated by the enemy, so that the country can achieve final victory as soon as possible, and you can also preserve your historical reputation. My direct opinions are included in the ranks of frank friends, to express my last words. Whether you know me or blame me, it is up to you to decide. Long Yun, (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>

<h3>Polish Foreign Minister's Statement: Willing to Negotiate with Germany, Provided Germany Has a Peaceful Intent - Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance and Franco-Polish Alliance Aimed at Maintaining European Balance</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Polish Foreign Minister Beck delivered a highly anticipated speech in the Lower House this morning, stating that if Germany expresses a peaceful intent and peaceful procedures, and if Germany recognizes the following principles, then Poland is prepared to negotiate with it: (1) Poland insists on its right to overseas trade and Danzig's navigation policy. (2) Poland will not allow its own country to be annexed and unable to access the Baltic Sea. (3) Poland is willing to expand railway conveniences in the corridor to achieve road transportation, but without limiting its sovereignty in the area. (4) Although Danzig's residents are mostly Germans, the lives of the people still rely on Poland. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Foreign Minister Beck delivered a speech in the Lower House this morning, first stating that in the past, the collective security system failed to be implemented, so countries have adopted bilateral talks to improve the current situation. As a result, relations between Poland and certain countries have improved, but serious difficulties have arisen with other countries. The negotiations for the new Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement were able to be concluded quickly because both sides held consistent views on important European issues, and the British authorities' full understanding of Poland's position was appreciated. Neither Britain nor Poland intends to invade any country; what they seek is merely that the basic principles on which international life is based are respected. Regarding the existing alliance treaty between France and Poland, it is a "key factor in the European political structure." As for the original goal of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, it was to resolve bilateral relations, but the German government suddenly unilaterally terminated it on the 28th of last month. The main argument it adopted was to criticize the newly established Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement. "In fact, before making this decision, the German government did not fully study the nature of the Anglo-Polish Agreement. Since returning from London last month, I have repeatedly expressed my readiness to meet with the German Ambassador Moltke to explain, but the ambassador returned home to report on his duties and has not met with me for a month. This is beyond initial expectations." At this point, it is urgently necessary to understand Germany's true intentions. Judging from the reasons adopted for this termination of the Non-Aggression Pact, one cannot help but be suspicious. Was the original intention of the country to sign this agreement to isolate Poland and prevent it from friendly cooperation with Western European countries? Is this really Germany's wish?" At this point, Foreign Minister Beck explained his views on Germany's demands to recover the Free City of Danzig and build a highway through the Polish Corridor, roughly saying that the current system of the Free City of Danzig is not a product of the Treaty of Versailles, but has existed for hundreds of years. The city is Poland's only port to the Baltic Sea and has always been one of the most important cities in our country. The free rights enjoyed by the Germans there have never been threatened by Poland, and Poland has never prevented the free development of the Germans in the city. This has also been repeatedly stated by the German authorities, that there will be no conflict between Germany and Poland because of "a province or a city." Moreover, as far as Poland is concerned, if the city is indeed划歸劃歸 to Germany, other countries will no longer be connected to the Baltic Sea. How can we accept this? Also, regarding the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor, the principle is the same. The Polish government has provided Germany with various conveniences in transportation, so that the province of Pomerania and the province of East Prussia can communicate with each other. "However, we will never allow anyone to limit the sovereignty we enjoy in our own territory. On the contrary, Germany's proposals regarding the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor almost require us to make unilateral concessions. Any country with self-respect will never make unilateral concessions. What are the exchange conditions proposed by Germany? When the head of state, Hitler, delivered a speech on the 28th of last month, he said that he was willing to sign a 25-year non-aggression pact with Poland and made a proposal on the issue of Czechoslovakia, but what the Polish government knows is only semi-official and extremely vague hints." At this point, Beck concluded by saying that if Germany can express a peaceful wish and determination, then it is still possible for Germany and Poland to negotiate. "If Germany accepts our principles, then both sides can begin talks. At that time, the Polish government will discuss the current issues with an objective attitude, full sincerity, and a willingness to consider the experiences of the past few weeks. Peace is a most precious thing, but as far as Poles are concerned, peace at any cost is absolutely unacceptable, because in the lives of individuals, nations, and countries, there are things that are worthy of being cherished, namely honor," he said.

<h3>German Troops Moving North</h3>
<p>Ambassador to Poland Returns to Post</p>
<p>(Berlin) Party troops and army units, carrying flat-trajectory cannons and other cannons, have left Munich heading north, but a small number of troops remain in the city. According to official sources, this is by no means an abnormal move. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The German ambassador to Poland, Moltke, who returned to his country to report on his duties a month ago, has now returned to his post here. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>The German Side: Expresses Optimism</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler will be in Berchtesgaden this afternoon with Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster, Danzig Senate Chairman Greiser, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to discuss Polish Foreign Minister Beck's speech. Before Poland formally replies to the German memorandum and thoroughly considers Beck's speech, Germany will not formally decide its attitude, but this non-official view is that the first impression of Beck's speech is that Poland's attitude is mild, even exceeding Germany's hopes. The German side is now talking about recovering Danzig without firing a shot soon. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech has not yet been commented on by official sources, but the impression among political circles is very poor. It is said that although Foreign Minister Beck did not close the door to negotiations on the issue of the Free City of Danzig, he also failed to seriously discuss the proposals put forward by Head of State Hitler on the 28th of last month. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech has not yet been commented on by political circles here because they are waiting for the original text, but the initial impression is still good. It is said that Foreign Minister Beck's wording is mild and has not put forward any demands, as some people are worried about, and the door to negotiations has not been closed. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech this morning has been commented on by political circles here. Its content is the same as what people generally expected. Poland is willing to negotiate with Germany to agree on the legal status of the Free City of Danzig, so that the rights enjoyed by the German residents are guaranteed, and Poland's economy can also develop freely. Therefore, the proposal to negotiate must be hoped for by German Head of State Hitler. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>European Authorities All Want to Maintain Peace - But Concepts of Peace Differ - Records of Meetings with Roman and Hungarian Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, on his way from Rome to the capital of Yugoslavia, met with an interviewer from the Yugoslavian newspaper "Politika" and gave a talk, outlining the impressions he had gained from visiting Germany, Belgium, France, Britain, and Italy over the past few weeks. "Carefully speaking, none of the responsible politicians in Europe want war. Everyone wants peace, but each person's interpretation of peace is not the same. When the reporter asked Mr. Gafencu about his mission to come to the South, he replied, "I plan to inform Southern Foreign Minister Markovitch of the impressions I gained from visiting various countries, and at the same time, we will discuss issues related to the two countries." (Haitong Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Capital of Hungary: Hungarian Foreign Minister Count Csáky said in the Upper House today that when he recently visited Rome and Berlin, the authorities of each country told him that the Axis powers had a need for peace because of their position, so they all wanted peace. The friendly objectives of the Axis powers are the same as the political intentions of the Hungarian government. We want to reach an understanding with Romania and friendship with Yugoslavia. The Axis powers attach great importance to a strong Hungary and believe that it is natural for us to maintain our traditional friendship with Poland. Now we can expect a long period of peaceful national construction. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>British Conscription - Has Affected Europe - Liberal Party Withdraws Opposition - No Conscription in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain presented the Military Training Bill for its second reading in the Lower House today, saying that the British people's determination to fully fulfill all kinds of commitments has aroused deep respect throughout Europe, which is beyond doubt. This law can obtain 200,000 new soldiers this year, and 800,000 in three years. The government has given generous consideration to conscientious objectors, and it is expected that the number of such people will be less than during the last Great War. Because this law does not force people to serve overseas or fight in trenches, but only forces them to receive short-term military training. As for the issue of military pay, in the first six months, trainees will receive one shilling per day, without any increase or decrease due to their position or profession. In the future, after entering the auxiliary team, the treatment they should receive will be decided later. Those whose families rely entirely on their support will receive a special allowance of seventeen shillings per week, and those who are partially dependent on their support will receive twelve shillings. Those with wives will receive seventeen shillings, and those with children will receive allowances according to the usual procedures. The age of regular soldiers and auxiliary soldiers is now higher than that of new recruits. The government now intends to stipulate that the age for which regular soldiers and auxiliary soldiers should receive family allowances is from the age of twenty. As for whether this law is applicable to Northern Ireland, the government feels that there are special difficulties in implementing this law in Northern Ireland, so it summoned Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon to London to discuss it. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, and what applies to England, Scotland, and Wales should naturally also apply to Northern Ireland. Moreover, the people of Northern Ireland are no less loyal to the British King and the United Kingdom than others. To say that the people of Northern Ireland are willing to be exempt from the obligations and sacrifices borne by people elsewhere is an insult to Northern Ireland. When Craigavon came to see me, he strongly stated the situation of Northern Ireland's loyalty to the King and love for the country, but felt that national unity was important and should not be slightly frustrated, so he did not intend to take any action, which would be used as an excuse by people who are not friendly to Britain, and he was willing to provide all the resources of Northern Ireland for the British government to use. Northern Ireland is eager to do anything that can help the British government. Regarding the final solution, he is willing to listen to the British government's decision. The attitude of the Northern Ireland Prime Minister and his government is very welcome to us. This is a pure expression of patriotism. Since the Northern Ireland Prime Minister has asked us to decide the solution and placed the important responsibility on our shoulders, we do not shirk our responsibility, so we have decided that this law does not apply to Northern Ireland. Section 15 of this law should be amended. We firmly believe that the spirit in which the Northern Ireland Prime Minister made this proposal to the British government can enable Northern Ireland to make a contribution to national defense that is by no means insignificant. The government has now decided to organize a Northern Ireland army in the form of a light tank unit according to the supplementary reserve measures. I am sure this announcement will greatly satisfy Northern Ireland. The sooner this law is passed, the sooner national security can be guaranteed and its impact on European countries will be greater. After the government proposed this case, it has eliminated foreign doubts about Britain's truly actively engaging in national defense to maintain its own security and to fulfill its commitments. There are very few people in the country who do not know about the war. As for those who are not prepared to sacrifice their own lives but are willing to help preserve life, there must be many such people.</p>
<p>Labour Party's Lees-Smith put forward an amendment, saying that the voluntary military service system has never been unable to obtain the number of soldiers needed by the country. Judging from the enthusiastic registration of the public outside the voluntary national defense training centers, it can be seen that there is no need for Britain to implement the conscription system. Now, adopting the European conscription system to recruit young people into the camp for three to six months of training is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. According to the Prime Minister, only 200,000 people will be trained under the conscription law, but 700,000 to 800,000 can be obtained under the voluntary military service system.</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Sinclair also spoke, agreeing with the voluntary military service system, and said that the maintenance of peace depends not only on Britain's strength, morality, and ability to make an impression on the consciences of those in power in other countries, but also on the cooperation between Britain and other peace-loving countries. We must also make the people of Germany and Italy understand our feelings of friendship and goodwill.</p>
<p>Conservative Party's Warrender said that this law stipulates that those in Northern Ireland abroad are merely held by another country's leader as having the right to interfere in this case, causing the British government to abandon its original intention.</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Eden rose to speak amidst cheers. I believe the voluntary military service system has completely disappeared in Britain. Although Britain is now adopting important new measures, I do not believe that anyone wants to deprive the people of their freedom. To say that the adoption of the conscription system is the first step for Britain to move towards a dictatorship is absurd. If there is such a trend, the Lower House can immediately stop it. Without the voluntary support of the majority, Britain can never have any compulsory service. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons today presented the "Military Training Bill" for its second reading. Prime Minister Chamberlain first delivered a speech, declaring that the government will not implement conscription in Northern Ireland. Opposition Labour MP Lees-Smith followed with an amendment, advocating maintaining the current voluntary service system. However, Opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair, on behalf of the party, declared a change of attitude and will vote in favor of the government's proposal on Monday next week. In addition, Northern Ireland Conservative MP Sir O'Neill expressed his opposition to the fact that conscription will not be implemented in Northern Ireland, saying that the government's decision was actually due to pressure from the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic, de Valera. The method adopted by de Valera is no different from that used by German Head of State Hitler. Former Foreign Secretary Eden then spoke, fully endorsing the "Military Training Bill," but asked the government to provide two guarantees: (1) that there will be no changes in the nature and scope of Britain's guarantees to other countries, and (2) that the government is still willing to invite the Soviet Union to join the peace front and, as soon as possible, to conclude the most complete agreement with that country and other peace-loving countries. Finally, Minister of Labour Brown, on behalf of the government, concluded the debate, roughly saying that after the British government accepted commitments to Poland, Romania, and Greece, it further implemented conscription, which is the most important event with the greatest impact on the European situation in recent weeks. Regarding the guarantees requested by Mr. Eden, I dare to clearly answer, "Regarding the first item, there have been no changes in the nature and scope of our country's agreement with Poland. Regarding the second item, Prime Minister Chamberlain has said that there is nothing to report at the moment, but he also admits that it would be a good thing to issue a declaration as soon as possible to explain the results of the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. As soon as the opportunity permits, the Prime Minister will definitely issue a declaration as soon as possible to explain. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Dublin: British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the Lower House today that Northern Ireland is not included in the British conscription plan has relieved political circles here who do not want to weaken good relations with Britain. It is heard that Southern Prime Minister de Valera is very satisfied with this action of the British government, but refuses to make comments. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Nationalist Army: Triumphant Entry into Madrid Postponed Again</h3>
<p>(London) According to the latest news received in London, the triumphal parade in Madrid has been set for May 21. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Nationalist Army was originally scheduled to make a triumphant entry into the city on the 15th of this month. Officials here recently declared that this matter will probably be postponed because there are as many as 130,000 members of the participating troops, and it is feared that there will not be enough time to arrange the concentration sites before that day. Therefore, the date of entry into the city may be postponed again. As for the specific date, it will not be announced until a few days before the Nationalist Army is prepared to make a triumphant entry into the city. It is expected that it will not be later than the 20th of this month. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Information Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs today notified foreign reporters that the system of news telegram censorship will be abolished from today, but if the telegrams sent by reporters are clearly hostile to the Soviet Union or hinder the prestige of the Soviet Union, the government will order them to leave the country.

<h3>Japan's Five-Minister Conference Decides on Policy Towards Europe, Arida Reports to Cabinet, Contents Remain Mysterious</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the informal meetings of the five ministers have concluded following ongoing exchanges of views among key cabinet members. Agreement has reportedly been reached among the ministers regarding Japan's policy towards the European situation. The five ministers are expected to hold another meeting soon to formally approve the finalized policy. [May 5th Dispatch]</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arida reported on the European situation at today's cabinet meeting. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, when questioned by reporters, declined to comment on the possibility of a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. However, he stated that Japan has its own independent foreign policy, as repeatedly declared by Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arida. This policy differs from both democratic and dictatorial nations, and aims to maintain and promote friendly relations with all foreign countries. (May 5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese government sources last night, Prime Minister Hiranuma has obtained imperial approval for the view that the proposed military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy would only apply to the Soviet Union. This amounts to a rejection of forming a military alliance with European dictatorial states against democratic countries. This move could significantly impact both the European situation and Japanese domestic politics, as many in the military and right-wing circles advocate for an unrestricted military alliance with Germany and Italy. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Arida invited the German and Italian ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry for discussions, presumably to inform them of the Japanese government's decision. It is reported that Arida told the two ambassadors that while Japan is willing to enter into a military alliance with Germany and Italy against the Soviet Union, it is unwilling to form a military alliance against democratic nations. According to observations from various circles in Japan, this move could have three possible outcomes: (1) Germany and Italy might refuse to enter into an alliance limited to the Soviet Union; (2) the strength of the entire Anti-Comintern Pact would be weakened due to Japan's unwillingness to participate in a military alliance against democratic countries; and (3) the friendly relations between Germany and Japan within the Anti-Comintern Pact could turn into hostile relations, as the deterioration of relations between Germany and Japan has been brewing for a long time. (May 5th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating: "Rumors are rampant in Tokyo that Germany and Italy are about to sign a military alliance treaty. Well-informed sources here have neither confirmed nor denied this, simply stating that they are unaware of such a development. Germany and Italy have already formed a de facto military alliance, making a treaty unnecessary." (May 5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Declares No Intentional Delay, British-Russian Negotiations Still Underway, Opinions on Russian Proposals Exchanged with France, Litvinov's Resignation Attracts International Attention</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union regarding the international situation are ongoing. Britain has not caused any unavoidable delays. The British government has exchanged views with France on the Soviet proposals and only received a response from France yesterday. It is hoped that British opinions will be sent to Moscow within days. Some individuals harbor a doubtful attitude, believing that if an agreement has not been reached or if there are disagreements, the fault must lie with the British government. This attitude is incorrect, and it is not accurate to say that a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached. (May 5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers continue to speculate about the reasons for the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. The Times, News Chronicle, and Daily Herald all state that the British-Soviet negotiations and Soviet foreign policy will not be affected. (May 5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Senior government officials had a long-distance telephone conversation with Moscow this evening. Afterwards, it was reported that the slow progress of talks between Britain and the Soviet Union greatly displeased Stalin, leading to Litvinov's resignation. Stalin has reportedly decided to force Britain to choose one of two paths: either Britain immediately agrees to a treaty of alliance with the Soviet Union to supplement the existing Franco-Soviet treaty, or the Soviet Union will separate itself from Western European countries. Stalin's sudden decision is motivated by two factors: first, Japan's refusal to sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy; and second, the imminent closure of Germany's access to the Baltic Sea, which demands a swift response. Although officials at the Soviet Embassy here claim that there will be no change in Soviet foreign policy after Litvinov's departure, they also acknowledge that the embassy's attempt to contact the government in Moscow by long-distance telephone was unsuccessful. Furthermore, opinions differ among members of the British Parliament. Most Conservatives are willing to accept the assurances previously offered by the Soviet Embassy, while a minority of Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party believe that the slow progress of British-Soviet negotiations, coupled with Stalin's impatience, has caused Litvinov to be uneasy in his position, potentially leading to the abandonment of the policy of establishing understanding between the Soviet Union and Western European democratic countries. Members of the opposition Liberal Party believe that Stalin's decision to break away from Western European countries is due to Japan's refusal to sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. If so, then since Hitler cannot rely on Japan to contain the Soviet Union, he will seek Soviet neutrality. As the Soviet Union cannot rely on British and French assistance in the Far East, a compromise with Germany would be more advantageous. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Following the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, the British government is experiencing considerable diplomatic turbulence. Foreign Secretary Halifax received Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi and Turkish Minister Rüstü Aras this afternoon. Ambassador Quo Tai-chi informed Foreign Secretary Halifax of the Chinese government's position regarding the inclusion of the Sino-Japanese dispute on the agenda of the League of Nations Council and sought the British government's opinion. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the British and Turkish authorities, government sources claim that an agreement has been reached and will soon be announced. The Turkish government had originally intended to wait until the successful conclusion of British-Soviet negotiations before making the announcement, but due to Litvinov's resignation and the likely suspension of British-Soviet negotiations, it no longer insists on the original plan. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in the current negotiations between Britain and Romania, the scope of which is even broader than what was agreed in principle when Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu visited Britain previously. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet hosted a luncheon for Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz today and held talks during the meal. Afterwards, French officials stated that despite the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, there will be no change in the country's foreign policy. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet also received Polish Ambassador Łukasiewicz, Romanian Ambassador Titulescu, and Greek Minister Politis today and stated that France will provide assistance if Poland's interests are threatened by the impact of Litvinov's resignation. However, only Poland can determine under what circumstances its interests are considered threatened. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British-Turkish Negotiations Concluded</h3>
<p>The Turkish capital: Regarding the organization of a collective security system, responsible sources here declared that the negotiations between Britain and Turkey could be completed today and an agreement signed in the shortest possible time. (May 5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Passes Resolution Calling for US Government to Sanction Japan to Prevent Harm to American Trade in China</h3>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, the American Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution calling on the government to take action to counter Japanese obstruction of American commerce in China. The resolution reads: "We should make every possible effort to develop and maintain American commercial opportunities in China, ensuring that American citizens in China enjoy equal rights and privileges with citizens of other countries, and that all matters are handled in accordance with established American policies and international treaties. The obstacles to American commerce in certain parts of China are both active and unfair, and therefore the government should take action to remove these obstacles and reopen Chinese markets that have been closed to American commerce. The methods adopted by the government to protect the lives and property of Americans in China are generally commendable." (May 5th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Turkish capital: Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, who has been in the Turkish capital for talks with Turkish officials for several days, has repeatedly postponed his return. Due to the sudden resignation of People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, he is expected to be sent back to Moscow tomorrow. Turkish officials also stated that Potemkin's views on collective security during his discussions here differed from those of Litvinov. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov has been commented on by political figures here, who said that the Soviet Union had proposed a mutual assistance plan to Britain, which was rejected. Litvinov's departure at this time suggests that the British effort to organize an anti-aggression bloc is at least temporarily suspended. The Soviet Union may distance itself from Western European countries and go its own way. As for the United States, some who advocate for a wait-and-see approach by the American government are emboldened. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt is currently unwilling to make new efforts in accordance with the telegram. The American government believes that since German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have not formally responded to the President's proposal, it remains valid. However, it is increasingly clear that Chancellor Hitler has no intention of abandoning the use of force and intimidation tactics. As American isolationists and the President's political opponents are very active, further expressions from the President on this matter would likely cause public unease. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The resignation of People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov is generally seen as a sign of censure. Some say that he will be appointed ambassador to the United States, but this cannot be confirmed. Experienced observers say that if war breaks out in Europe in the future, the Soviet Union will maintain its freedom of action as much as circumstances permit, and its sympathies will naturally lie with the democratic countries. As for the present, the Soviet Union may not be approaching Germany, but since Britain and France have guaranteed the security of Poland and Romania, they have indirectly guaranteed the security of the Soviet Union's western border. Therefore, unless Britain and France offer new benefits, the Soviet Union may not accept any new obligations and will focus on establishing a security system in the Black Sea region, regardless of British and French policies. This can be seen in Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin's visit to Turkey. Some say that Litvinov's departure is intended as a warning to Western European countries to accept Soviet proposals, but most people are unwilling to commit themselves. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Following the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, German political figures have expressed unanimous satisfaction, saying that the policy of encirclement has suffered a blow. But the Soviet Union and Western Europe cannot proceed. When news of Litvinov's departure spread, London, Paris, and Warsaw were greatly shaken, indicating that Britain, France, and Poland have been greatly impacted. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt stated that Litvinov was a disciple of Lenin and that his foreign policy was incompatible with the Comintern's eastward expansion. People's Commissar Chairman Molotov, on the other hand, is a close confidant of Stalin and has always advocated for a foreign policy fully aligned with the Comintern's actions. The two are diametrically opposed. Other newspapers stated that Litvinov's departure was due to disagreements within the Soviet authorities regarding the country's policy of cooperation with Western European countries. The Angriff newspaper even carried a dispatch from its Warsaw correspondent stating that People's Commissar Chairman Molotov, People's Commissar for Defense Marshal Voroshilov, and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee Zhdanov recently had a heated debate on foreign policy. Litvinov submitted his resignation after the debate. Zhdanov reportedly strongly criticized Litvinov, and the Soviet military authorities were unwilling to accept overly onerous obligations. (May 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov is generally considered a major event in the European situation. The Soviet Union's abandonment of the entire policy of "indivisible peace" can be seen in this. The Fascist Party's Il Lavoro Fascista stated that Germany and Italy have never taken into account the Soviet Union's position in European politics and that there is no need to be alarmed by Litvinov's departure.

<h3>British-American Negotiations to Exchange Raw Materials for Wartime Use</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that negotiations have begun with the US government to exchange raw materials for wartime use. The US government recently inquired of the British government whether it would consider exchanging raw materials stored by the US for military use for items the US government had in excess that could increase British reserves for wartime needs. This matter was initiated by the US government, and the British government fully understands the importance of this proposal. The US government opposes commodity exchanges to replace ordinary international trade, and so does the British government. However, in the current special circumstances, the exchange of raw materials outside the scope of normal commerce, provided that it does not increase world prices, is not objectionable. The British government has expressed its readiness to begin discussions and to remove any practical difficulties in implementing this plan. Therefore, these British-American negotiations have now begun. When asked by a Member of Parliament whether this plan would involve purchasing large quantities of raw materials from private owners in the country, the Prime Minister replied that he was aware that the raw materials the US government proposed to exchange were already in the US government's possession, so there would be no purchases from merchants. When asked whether Britain would need to purchase rubber and tin from merchants, Chamberlain replied that the British government was aware of the situation. Another Member of Parliament asked whether the government had started negotiations with British tin and rubber suppliers and set a price for the surplus the government would accept. Chamberlain replied, "No." A Member of Parliament asked whether there had been a similar tightening policy in the past two months and whether the Bank of England, the Treasury, and the Midland Bank had held widely divergent views. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied that the terms "inflation" and "tightening" were difficult to define and that he believed the government was pursuing an appropriate policy and there was no tightening. Another Member of Parliament asked whether the Chancellor believed that the Bank of England's inflation could help maintain low interest rates. Simon replied that low interest rates were generally beneficial. (May 4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US-Japan Engaging in Naval Arms Race</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy stated before the House Appropriations Committee today that Japan is currently building three battleships of between 42,000 and 46,000 tons. The committee has approved a naval budget of $777 million, which includes funding for building two battleships of 45,000 tons and 21 other warships, as well as 500 aircraft. The two battleships are scheduled to be launched in 1943, each costing $93 million and equipped with 16-inch guns. Leahy said, "I believe that we should not agree to any parity arrangement before we build these 45,000-ton battleships and before they are completed this year. International turmoil is likely to occur in the near future, so the US Navy's strengthening program should be completed as quickly as possible, without any delay." Leahy particularly emphasized the future plans of Germany, Italy, and Japan. (May 4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The naval budget for fiscal year 1939-40 totals $770,473,241, of which $254,204,712 will be used to start construction of 23 warships of various sizes, including two 45,000-ton battleships, two cruisers, eight destroyers, eight submarines, one supply ship, and two seaplane tenders (in addition to the 121 warships of various sizes already under construction). Another $246,206,000 will be used to increase the number of naval officers and men. In addition, maintenance costs for naval bases and shipyards will increase by $24,000,000 compared to this year, and the funds needed to purchase naval aircraft will also increase by $33,000,000 compared to this year. The funds needed to build naval bases on Midway Island, Wake Island, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island in the Pacific were not specified. (April 4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Department of Commerce recently announced that Japan's shipbuilding plans have been hampered by a shortage of steel and metal materials. This announcement was made after receiving a report from US Vice Consul in Kobe, Mr. Aphiel. According to Mr. Aphiel's estimate, Japan's iron ore needs for this year are 7,500,000 tons, while domestic production is only 2,600,000 tons. (April 4th Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Devaluation of Puppet Currency, Puppet Officials Anxious</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China "Provisional Government" authorities are now seeking to remedy the panic caused by the sharp decline in the exchange rate of the United Reserve Bank of China (URB) banknotes. The British Concession authorities, affected by the declining value of the Japanese-backed currency, have begun to implement self-protective measures. Starting today, all payment slips will state that if the value of the currency received declines, the fee will be increased by up to 30%. The telephone bureau has taken similar action. The British authorities stated that the action is temporary and will be revised as needed. The "Provisional Government" authorities are very concerned about the gradual decline in the value of URB banknotes. They have held informal talks with Chinese and foreign bankers in an effort to curb speculation against the currency, believing that speculation is one of the main causes of the currency's collapse. The suggestions they put forward include: (1) expanding the list of goods subject to export controls; (2) increasing the URB's foreign exchange reserves to operate on a wider scale; (3) manipulating URB banknotes on the exchange market; and (4) the Bank of China freely remitting URB banknotes to Shanghai at full value. The unofficial exchange rate of URB banknotes today is the same as yesterday, at a discount of 30%, meaning that 130 URB dollars can be exchanged for 100 Chinese legal tender dollars.

<h3>Yi-yu's Chinese Troops Entirely Sacrificed Themselves, After Repeated Counterattacks, Again Under Siege</h3>
<p>Guangde: The Chinese troops who entered Yi-yu City were determined to coexist or perish with the city and vowed not to retreat. After a day and night of street fighting, all were martyred heroically. At 10 pm on the 3rd night, the Chinese troops launched another counterattack on Yi-yu, engaging in fierce fighting until dawn this morning. All strongholds outside Yi-yu were occupied by the Chinese troops, and 20 sections of the Wuxi-Yi-yu highway were destroyed, along with 60 li of road surface and 22 li of telegraph poles. Yi-yu is now under siege by the Chinese troops on all sides. (May 4th Dispatch)</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and delivered a speech on the understanding that should be had when commemorating the Fifth-Fifth anniversary. (May 5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Ru-zao Lie Low in the City</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Recover Key Points on Highway, County Government Strictly Inspects Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Ru-fu Communications: Since April 12th, when the guerrilla forces of Ru-zao received orders for a general counteroffensive, Nanshiang's Nian-tuo Port along the river has been recovered. The key points of Linzi and Dongdong on the Tong-Ru highway, which are important points in the Ru section, have also been recovered one after another. Many sections of the highway have also been destroyed. The Japanese troops have retreated to the city walls, lacking the former might and power.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops occupying the county seat and Ding-yan, Bai-pu, Shi-zhuang, and other places require those entering and leaving the areas to have passes, which are then subjected to strict inspection before passage is permitted. The Japanese troops' fear is evident in this.</p>
<p>The Xin-sheng Gate is the lifeblood of Ru-zao's water source and is managed closely. A special commissioner has been appointed to manage it. Since the fall of Xin-sheng Port, Xiao Xianjian has been appointed gate official, abusing his power and relying on the Japanese troops' brutality to extort small passage fees from boat owners, which is despised by everyone. On the 22nd of last month, while Xiao was directing puppet officials to forcibly collect fees from boatmen, two guerrilla soldiers stepped forward, displayed pistols, and ordered him to leave the gate. He was then arrested by the two men, transferred to the military court, and, after a thorough investigation, sentenced to death, serving as a warning to all traitors.</p>
<p>Xue Ruzong, the former commander of the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Force, has now been promoted to commander of the First Brigade, leading Japanese troops, is known throughout the county. However, he is always worried about a shortage of bullets. Therefore, Jiang Bucheng, Guo Mingda, and the Mingli brothers have devoted themselves to the brigade to manufacture bullets and repair all damaged firearms, working tirelessly.</p>
<p>The Nisshin Shipping Company dispatches ships to Tiansheng Port in Nantong to operate the Shanghai-Tong Lianyun line. The taxes on Japanese goods arriving in Ru-zao are very low, and the prices are cheaper than in the guerrilla area. Therefore, many ignorant people abandon the expensive and seek the cheap. As countless Japanese goods flood the market, the county government has issued orders to all subordinate agencies to conduct strict inspections, with violators subject to punishment.</p>
<p>Residents living in this chaotic situation deeply hope that newspapers from Shanghai will arrive. However, due to Japanese inspection, there is no way to send them by mail. Therefore, several strong men specialize in selling Shanghai newspapers to the guerrilla area. Shen Bao is the most popular, followed by Wenhui Bao. All other newspapers have disappeared.</p>

<h3>Record of Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an's Armies Resisting the War on the East Bank of the Xiang River</h3>
<p>Japanese Combat Troops Reached Two Divisions, Attempting to Go Straight to Jingzhou and Shashi to Threaten Yichang; Japanese Claimed 6,000-7,000 Casualties</p>
<p>Nanzhang Correspondence: From mid-February to early March, the Chinese Army's XXX Army Group, led by Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an, fought fiercely with the Japanese army in the Zhongxiang area on the east bank of the Xiang River, repeatedly inflicting significant blows on the Japanese. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Intentions</p>
<p>Since mid-February, the Japanese 16th Division Commander, Keifuku Fujie, after occupying Tianmen, actively and successively increased troops in the Jingshan Zao city area, gradually advancing westward. The combat troops consisted of the entire 16th Division and part of the 19th Division, along with attached special forces, plus the puppet Mongolian army's 7th Route Army under Ha Tongzhu, totaling 25,000 men. On the 22nd, they launched a full-scale attack in three routes against the Chinese army's defense lines on the Han-Yi, Jing-Zhong highways and the left bank of the Xiang River. Their intention was to cross the Xiang River, go straight to Jingzhou and Shashi, cut off the Chinese side's north-south transportation, threaten Yichang, hoping to eliminate worries about the west, and cross the Yangtze River from Shashi to attack northern Hunan. Their ambition was considerable. The ones who shattered the Japanese army's dream were the armies of Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an. These two armies commanded six divisions, not including special forces. All officers and soldiers were brave men from Hebei and Shandong, and their strength should not be underestimated. They are indeed a powerful force in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Along the Han-Yi Road</p>
<p>On the morning of February 25th, after breaking through a certain unit's position in Wamiaoji with 600-700 Japanese infantry and cavalry supported by four artillery pieces, they advanced towards the forward positions of a certain division at Yiheji. At that time, only one company of the division's regiment was defending with extremely few soldiers against the invading enemy, engaging in a bloody battle, with most of them being killed or wounded. Fortunately, reinforcements arrived that night, and Yiheji was finally stabilized in the morning of the next day, after a series of gains and losses.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Japanese army attacked Yiheji, they also launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army's position at Qilin Temple with about 600 men and four artillery pieces. After repeated contests, the battle raged for an entire day. Due to the calm resistance of the defending soldiers, the Japanese army ultimately failed. However, the Chinese army's position at Yanmenkou, a vital stronghold, was in a very precarious state due to the large-scale Japanese attack. The Chinese army's regiment, in order to coordinate with friendly forces, resolutely dispatched Wei's battalion to support, despite being unable to protect themselves. After a half-day of fierce bloody battle, Battalion Commander Wei Shuqiao was wounded, and only thirty or so men returned, with the rest making heroic sacrifices. In a certain regiment's clash with the Japanese army at Qilin Temple, five or six hundred mechanized Japanese soldiers were indeed wiped out, but Wang's regiment of loyal and brave soldiers also suffered similar casualties.</p>
<p>The Japanese army broke in through Yanmenkou and went straight to Yonglong River, engaging in a fierce battle with the Chinese army at Yangjia Jiang on the 27th. Their main force of over 2,000 men and over ten artillery pieces turned north, threatening the Chinese army's right rear. The Chinese army then used its main force to defend the main position belt of Lishu Ridge and extended east-west to Xiayanggang, and dispatched the brigade of the division to flank the Japanese army at Xiayanggang Sikou. At this time, the Japanese army again reinforced with over 2,000 men and over ten artillery pieces, changed their plan, and launched a fierce roundabout attack, using airplanes and artillery as cover, making rapid advances. A bloody battle unfolded in the area of Tanjiaqiao and Hejiaji. Battalion Commander Zhang Yuliang was wounded, and Battalion Adjutant Li Chunxia was seriously wounded. Although the remaining officers and soldiers resisted desperately and repeatedly blunted the enemy's attacks, they were ultimately unable to withstand the power of machinery with their flesh and blood. On the 28th, amidst heavy sacrifices and heroic songs, they had to slightly shift their positions. There are many things worth recording in this battle. First, the battalion of the regiment attacked the Japanese army's headquarters at Taiheji and was about to break through the outer defenses to capture the enemy when Japanese reinforcements arrived, so they turned back amidst the victory of killing over eighty Japanese soldiers and capturing dozens of machine guns. Second, the regiment flanked the Japanese army west of Yanmenkou Liujiaji, destroying over ten Japanese armored vehicles and killing forty or fifty Japanese soldiers. The brigade engaged in positional warfare with the Japanese army, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses. The Chinese army indeed suffered casualties of six or seven hundred officers and soldiers, but thirty-seven truckloads of Japanese corpses were transported from Yanmenkou Yangjia Jiang, drove to Zao city, cremated, and sent back to their country.</p>
<p>On the Jing-Zhong Line</p>
<p>At noon on February 22nd, over 5,000 men of the Japanese army's He Ku brigade and over twenty artillery pieces launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army's Sunqiao position in three routes. The division of the Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese army failed. At the same time, five or six hundred Japanese soldiers in the Sanyangdian area fiercely attacked the Chinese army's position at Sanyangdian. A part of the division of the Chinese army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers. Japanese reinforcements arrived and attacked Luohan Ridge with a part of their forces. Because the Chinese army's communication lines were cut off, they withdrew to the west of Sanyangdian and fought fiercely.</p>
<p>The Japanese army attacking Sunqiao was repeatedly killed in large numbers by the division of the Chinese army at Lujia Ridge, and many backpacks, coats, documents, and military supplies were seized. The 28th, from morning to night, was extremely heroic. The division of the Chinese army fought bloody battles and were wounded, advancing wave after wave. Those killed by the Japanese army were also lying in piles. The Japanese army, having been repeatedly frustrated in their attacks, dispatched a powerful unit to outflank the Chinese army's left wing and attack the front of Guanqiao. The division of the Chinese army struggled to hold on from front and back, suffering heavy casualties, and finally, amidst tragic sounds, abandoned Sunqiao and transferred to Guanqiao to fight a bloody battle with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>It took the Japanese army seven days and nights and the sacrifice of over a thousand men to finally take Sunqiao. Although the Chinese army did not repel the Japanese army, the severity of the Japanese army's casualties was enough to shock them.</p>
<p>From March 1st, when the Japanese army on the Han-Yi Road transferred their forces and attempted to encircle Chui Xiang from Jiukou, the battle on the Jing-Zhong Road became even more intense. The Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the Guanqiao position with their main force, and then outflanked from the left and right with two units, threatening Dongqiao. They also concentrated the firepower of over forty artillery pieces and, together with Japanese aircraft, bombed in formation, flattening the Chinese army's positions. The Japanese army also released a large amount of poison gas, causing the Huang division to form a tragic positional battle. The fearless division commander was still directing the battle on the front lines, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, suffering heavy losses. The battle was repeatedly contested five or six times. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers who had sneaked in from Liufangzui also engaged in a bloody battle with the division and Bai Qi Wu's unit in the area east of Changshoudian on the left side of the Chinese army. At this time, the brigade of the division and the brigade of the division were ordered to reinforce and flank Dongqiao. But at one hundred in the evening, when they had just arrived at Changtanbu, the Japanese army at Zhengjiaji and other places attacked from behind in two routes with over 2,000 infantry and cavalry supported by eight artillery pieces, and another bloody battle unfolded at dawn on the 3rd.</p>
<p>Amidst the fierce fighting in Dongqiao, another seven or eight hundred Japanese soldiers supported by four artillery pieces launched a fierce attack on the 2nd Battalion of the division of the Chinese army at Jiukou. After a day of bloody fighting, the Japanese army's firepower was strong, and the 2nd Company Commander Han was killed in battle, and the entire company also made a tragic sacrifice.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd, the commander encountered the Japanese army at Xiji and fought hard all night, hoping to hold on to the critical situation. The brigade also engaged in fierce battles with the superior Japanese army for several days, suffering particularly heavy casualties. They were all ordered to transfer their positions. At this time, the battle had reached its most intense stage, and the Japanese army was also approaching the county seat of Zhongxiang.</p>
<p>The Bloody Battle of Zhongxiang</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Zhongxiang in multiple routes. One advanced rapidly towards the city from Da Gai Lake, and another attacked westward from the Jing-Zhong Road. At the same time, the Japanese army at Liufangzui Wangjia Dian was also approaching the northeast of the city. The main force of the division of the Chinese army then engaged in a frontal conflict with the Japanese army. The people in the city, in the pouring rain, supported the old and carried the young, and retreated north. Although the road was full of mud, everyone was filled with tears, trudging through the mud, because they did not want to be submissive people and could only temporarily leave the hometown of their ancestors' graves.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese army had gathered and pressed against the city gates. The division and a part of the division engaged in a tragic street battle with the Japanese army. The Japanese soldiers who charged in several times were all cut down by the ruthless broadswords. Although they achieved the task of attrition, the Japanese army had a continuous surge of mechanized weapons, making it impossible for the Chinese army to make ends meet. Finally, at nine o'clock in the morning, the ancient county seat, which had been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft into a pile of rubble, was declared abandoned.</p>
<p>Although Zhongxiang is a pile of rubble and of no use, this tragic bloody battle will be permanently imprinted in people's minds and will also occupy the first glorious page in the history of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>An Overview After the Battle</p>
<p>According to the Japanese army's own report, the casualties of the Japanese army in this tragic battle have reached six or seven thousand (I think it's even more). They are exhausted and unable to invade again. It can be said that after the Battle of Wuhan, the Japanese army hit its first major snag. The Japanese army's material losses included over forty machine guns seized by the Chinese army, over ten armored vehicles destroyed, and over a hundred important documents, military supplies, backpacks, and coats seized. There were also quite a few other items. Although the Chinese army suffered considerable sacrifices, in the great era of national war, it is not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>The current situation is that the Japanese army is gathering 20,000 men at various crossing points on the east bank of the Xiang River, causing disturbances along the river, firing cannons aimlessly, and preparing bridge materials and ships, attempting to take the opportunity to cross. Their focus is on Shayang. The XXX Army Group has joined forces with various friendly armies to make strict deployments and give them another blow, so for half a month, the Japanese army has not dared to cross the border. We can see how fast the Japanese army progressed in the early stages, and how it took them half a year to get a dead city this time. Therefore, although their weapons and equipment are superior to the Chinese army, in this decisive battle, the comparison of the casualties of the two armies can be said to be equal in deaths and injuries, creating a new record since the start of the war.

<h3>Hong Kong Authorities Order Residents to Prepare One Month's Worth of Food Rations</h3>
<p>To Avoid Running Out of Food in Case of Unexpected Events; Japanese Army Builds Airfield, Hong Kong Under Great Threat</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Although the recent situation in Europe seems to have temporarily subsided between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, there is still a possibility of compromise. Whether it is a democratic country or an authoritarian country, none of them are determined to start a war immediately. However, the outbreak of war often comes unexpectedly. If a world war unfortunately breaks out, Hong Kong will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, in addition to working hard to strengthen military preparations and enhance defense, the Hong Kong authorities have now issued an order to make all Chinese and Western people in Hong Kong prepare one month's worth of food rations as soon as possible to avoid running out of food in the event of an unexpected event. The methods and quantities of food storage are specified as follows:</p>
<p>Amount of Food Rations to be Stored by Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>The amount of food rations to be stored by foreign nationals is as follows: 28 cans of breakfast food, 28 cans of lunch food, 28 cans of dinner food, 56 cans of soup, 20 cans of tomatoes, 24 loaves of bread, 4 cans of dried eggs, 4 cans of butter, 16 cans of cube sugar, 8 cans of jam, 8 cans of sweet biscuits, 4 cans of tea leaves, 8 cans of cocoa, 32 cans of pudding ingredients, 4 cans of cupcake ingredients, 10 cans of cornstarch, 8 cans of glucose, 4 cans of lard, 64 cans of cream milk, 20 cans of dried milk powder, 8 cans of oatmeal, 8 cans of candied plums, 4 cans of barley, 13 cans of lentils, 8 bags of sugar, 8 bottles of sweet glucose, 8 bottles of coffee essence, 12 bottles of white lemonade, 8 bottles of honey, and 25 pounds of flour.</p>
<p>Amount of Food Rations to be Stored by Chinese Nationals</p>
<p>For Chinese nationals, those with abundant wealth can store food rations according to the methods for foreign nationals. For middle and lower class families, the minimum amount of food rations for a family of ten is as follows: 200 catties of white rice, 15 catties of cooking oil, 500 catties of firewood, 5 catties of salt, 200 salted eggs, 10 catties of salted fish, 20 catties of salted pork, 10 catties of sugar, 5 jars of fermented bean curd, 20 pieces of preserved bean curd, 10 catties of dried vegetables, 15 catties of vegetables, and 4 catties of soy sauce. In winter, they can increase the storage of cured meat and bacon as appropriate.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Builds Airfield Near Hong Kong</p>
<p>At the same time, there is news that also makes the people of Hong Kong feel uneasy, and the Hong Kong authorities are even more threatened. According to today's "Hong Kong Daily Press," reliable sources say that the Japanese army has recently built a very large airfield fifty miles away from Hong Kong. The news was first brought to Hong Kong by a refugee who escaped from Dongguan. After investigation by the newspaper's reporter, the news has been confirmed. It is reported that the location of the Japanese army's airfield is Taiping, in Dongguan County. The airfield is large in scale and has now been mostly completed, and there are airplanes stationed there. If Japanese aircraft take off from the airfield to raid Hong Kong, they can arrive within ten minutes.</p>
<p>Large Shelters Being Built in the New Territories</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have been actively reorganizing air defense. Recently, the Hong Kong government advised residents to rush to build air-raid shelters. Wealthy families are actively preparing, and the general public's evacuation target is concentrated in the New Territories, because the area is mountainous and very remote. In the event of war and air raids, it is safer than densely populated areas. According to surveys, wealthy Hong Kong businessmen have recently been building houses in the New Territories. The exterior of these houses looks like villas, but the interior facilities are all used for protection against bombs and poison gas. As of now, more than twenty have been completed, and five or six are under construction. The existing villas and Western-style buildings are also being equipped with bomb shelters or digging air-raid trenches. It can be seen that Hong Kong is very uneasy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Danyang Still Attacking Guan's Troops</h3>
<p>All Villages Turned to Scorched Earth</p>
<p>Danyang Correspondence: On the 30th of last month, the Japanese army stationed in the city invaded the Fangxianqiao area and was defeated by Guan Wenwei's troops of the Jiangnan Advance Column. On the 3rd of this month, the Japanese army again dispatched a large force to invade the New Fourth Army's positions, hoping to annihilate Guan's troops, and occupied civilian houses in villages such as Ximao, Dongzhuang, Xie Rongmei, and Ma, using them as bunkers and constantly shooting at Guan's troops. However, the Chinese officers and soldiers were on guard and reported to General Xiang Ying, requesting that elite troops be dispatched to reinforce. Once the reinforcements arrive, they can encircle the Japanese army on all sides, cut off their retreat, and annihilate them. Currently, both sides are busy replenishing due to excessive casualties. However, the villages in the area have been almost completely burned down, a scorched earth. Over a thousand villagers, supporting the old and carrying the young, have left their homes.</p>

<h3>Many Obstacles to Supply, Rice Industry Raises Price Limit</h3>
<p>Highest Price for White Rice Set at 15 Yuan per Stone, Strict Penalties Imposed to Prevent Exceeding Price Limit Again</p>
<p>After the rice industry associations worked hard to adjust the supply of rice for Shanghai's people, it was stipulated that the price limit for number one white rice should not exceed 14 yuan. In recent days, due to the scarcity of goods arriving, prices have soared, exceeding the price limit. The market was unable to trade yesterday morning and was temporarily closed. The rice industry associations held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday and decided to change the highest price limit to 15 yuan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Soybean and Rice Market Closed Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>As of the end of April, Shanghai's rice reserves were 611,153 bags, only 41,303 bags less than the previous time, which means the reserves are still sufficient and the people's food supply should not be lacking for the time being. However, the price of rice in the city has suddenly soared due to the arrival of fewer goods, exceeding the 14 yuan price limit. High-quality glutinous rice has even risen to over 15 yuan. Although the market management committee advised against this, it was ineffective, resulting in improper black market trading. When the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the price of rice continued to soar without limit, and the management committee was unable to stop it, so it had no choice but to announce a temporary market closure and wait for the decision of the joint meeting of the rice industry associations at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Associations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry, Rice Shops, Rice Merchants, Rice Milling Industry, Shanghai Northbound Rice Merchants' United Benefit Association, Changshu Rice Guild, Southbound Rice Guild, and seven rice industry associations held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday morning on the second floor of the Grain, Oilcake, and Bean Trading Exchange at 15 Edward Road. Xing Zhigang, Zhu Xiangsheng, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, She Bingwen, Yang Heqing, Zhou Zhizhen, Huang Zhihe, Huang Ruyuan, Jiang Hongbin, Fu Qiangeng from the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Shi Hongxun, Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao from the Rice Shops, Zhu Ziming from the Shanghai Northbound Rice Merchants' United Benefit Association, Zhu Zhaoqi from the Rice Milling Industry, Yan Jiyun from the Southbound Rice Guild, Zhang Songtao from the Rice Merchants, Shi Zufú from the Changshu Guild, and Hu Bokang and Gu Yisheng, representatives of the rice market, were present. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman, who reported on the situation of rice prices exceeding the limit and discussed various important proposals.</p>
<p>Decision to Change Price Limit After Discussion</p>
<p>The following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the recent soaring rice prices, which far exceed the limit, a proposal was made to discuss how to handle this situation. The resolution was as follows: The Soybean and Rice Industry Association originally set the price limit at no more than 14 yuan per stone for the highest quality white rice, with separate grades for other varieties. This has been in place for a year, and the rice industry associations have made every effort to maintain it, remaining unwavering, which has been a great effort. However, recently, there have been many obstacles to the supply of rice. For example, Wuxi limits the amount of rice transported to Shanghai to five vehicles, totaling 625 bags. Suzhou limits the amount to 40,000 bags per month. Rice prices in Changshu and other places are higher than in Shanghai. Rice boats from the Southbound region are blocked by the rice market crossing point. The suburbs of Shanghai are purchasing from Shanghai. As for the Yangtze River region, the price of rice in Wuhu has risen, and taxes have been added. Nanjing cannot transport rice to Shanghai. With the source of supply scarce and inventories gradually decreasing, prices have soared, far exceeding the limit. It is reported that the recent price of high-quality glutinous rice has risen to over 15 yuan. If this continues without limit and without remedy, it will have a huge impact on the people's food supply. The joint meeting of the rice industry associations today seriously discussed this matter and believes that maintaining the original limit is impossible due to the facts. Moreover, the price of production in the interior is high, and taxes are heavy, so merchants suffer losses, which must also be taken into consideration in order to increase the source of supply. Therefore, after careful consideration of the situation, it was decided to re-stipulate the highest prices: 15 yuan per stone for the highest quality white glutinous rice and fine glutinous rice, and 14 yuan per stone for the highest quality guest glutinous rice. The separate grades for other rice varieties must be strictly followed to take care of the livelihood of ordinary people. For goods traded before today, if the price is higher than 15 yuan, the price should be settled at 15 yuan per stone. In the future, if anyone does not comply with the above price limits, the rice industry associations should jointly investigate. Once discovered, strict penalties will be imposed, and the penalties are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>Penalties Stipulated and Strictly Enforced</p>
<p>The fine is proportional to the number of stones. For the first offense, the buyer, seller, and intermediary will each be fined one yuan per stone. For the second offense, the fine will be doubled. For the third offense, the fine will be doubled again. However, if the amount traded is small, then for the first offense, the buyer, seller, and intermediary will each be fined at least 100 yuan. For the second offense, the fine will be doubled. For the third offense, the fine will be doubled again. 30% of the fine will be given to the informant as a reward, and the remaining amount will be used for charitable expenses. In addition to being announced in the market, the above resolutions should be sent to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for their records. (2) A proposal was made to prohibit the return of tickets for purchased rice. It was resolved that once rice has been traded, whether between shops, between brokers, or between colleagues, the tickets cannot be returned. If the samples do not match, only an inspection is allowed, not a return. If the two parties cannot resolve the issue, they can request the evaluation committee to handle it fairly.</p>
<p>Encouraging Merchants to Actively Purchase</p>
<p>The soybean and rice market temporarily declared a suspension of business yesterday due to soaring black market prices. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the management committee of the soybean and rice market yesterday that the market will resume normal business today. At that time, Fu Qiangeng, the chairman of the management committee of the market, will report the proceedings of the joint meeting of the rice industry associations to the various merchants and urge them to purchase as much as possible from the production areas in order to regulate the supply of rice for the people of Shanghai. The rice industry associations will report the proceedings of yesterday's joint meeting to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for their records and will announce it in the soybean and rice market.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Hang Flags Yesterday to Celebrate the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government</h3>
<p>Emulating the Premier's Revolutionary Personality, Striving for National Freedom and Equality</p>
<p>Yesterday, May 5th, was the anniversary of the Kuomintang Premier's inauguration as the Grand Marshal of the Extraordinary Government. All agencies, public groups, companies, shops, factories, schools, and households in the city uniformly hung the national flag in enthusiastic celebration. The schools also held commemorative meetings yesterday morning, recounting the Premier's revolutionary history for self-encouragement. All sectors believe that eighteen years ago, warlords were arrogant and politicians were jumping around, and the revolutionary environment was extremely harsh. The Premier, in order to reorganize the revolutionary ranks, could not bear to see the national foundation painstakingly created by countless martyrs lost. Therefore, he resolutely took office as the Grand Marshal of the Extraordinary Government. This spirit of daring to take responsibility and continue to fight is forever worthy of emulation. All will uphold his legacy and emulate the Premier's great revolutionary personality in order to strive for the freedom and equality of the nation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Deliberately Plans to Change Concession Administration, Japanese Consul Visits British and American Consuls and the Municipal Council, Proposing Amendments to the Land Regulations</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" stated that the Japanese Consulate General issued a press release last night (the 4th), stating that Japanese Consul General Miura successively visited British Consul General Phillips, American Consul General Gauss, and Municipal Council Chairman Finkler yesterday afternoon to request amendments to the so-called outdated Land Regulations by the Japanese side in order to reorganize the administration of the International Settlement. Miura also strongly stated that the Special District Court needs "practical reform," that its judges are appointed by the Chongqing regime and have "no real power in the Shanghai area," and that they acquit anti-Japanese elements.</p>
<p>Miura's Protest</p>
<p>Immediately followed the joint declaration issued by the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy authorities on Tuesday, expressing dissatisfaction with the current situation in the foreign-administered areas, and the Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Sawada's statement to British Ambassador Craigie and American Ambassador Grew on Wednesday, stating that Japan hopes to reform the International Settlement. It is reported that both the British and American consuls general agreed that Miura would report this matter to their respective governments. Finkler himself</p>
<p>Declined to Comment</p>
<p>But stated that this issue must be decided by the Consular Body. Miura told Japanese reporters last night that the Land Regulations have become the constitution of the International Settlement. If the Land Regulations are not considered, then from a practical and legal point of view, the difficulties concerning the International Settlement cannot be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, I made specific suggestions for amending the Land Regulations during my visit today.</p>
<p>Specific Suggestions</p>
<p>We can say that the so-called International Settlement issue has now entered its final stage. Since the British control the real power of the International Settlement and the Americans support them, I first visited the consuls of these two countries to give them an impression of our views. Now that we have raised the dispute, we cannot abandon it without results. We are determined to reach a compromise with the countries concerned. The Italian Consul General, who is also the senior consul, supports amending the Land Regulations, which is a great fortune for us.</p>
<p>Exchange of Views</p>
<p>This is what I discovered later. I think this point will prove to be a valuable help. The Japanese Consulate General's press release added that Miura reiterated the Japanese government's determination to deal with the International Settlement. Miura told his colleagues that the Tokyo authorities believe that it is necessary to "fundamentally amend" the Land Regulations adopted seventy years ago and reform the court to meet the "new situation."</p>
<h3>Ningbo: The Urban Area is Quiet</h3>
<p>Stores Operate at Night; Pacification Work is Busy</p>
<p>After Ningbo was bombed three times by Japanese aircraft, the city appearance was extremely desolate. During the daytime, residents mostly avoided the suburbs, and the population decreased significantly. Only in the evening did the markets begin to gather slightly. After Ningbo was bombed,</p>
<p>The Commercial Area Rapidly Evacuated</p>
<p>After Ningbo was bombed, the area around Zhongshan East Road (i.e., Dongmenwei), which was a prosperous area, the stores in that area, in order to reduce losses from air raids, implemented the evacuation of goods, resulting in a continuous stream of moving vehicles, a busy situation. In recent days, it has become relatively stable.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Night Market</p>
<p>Ningbo's business hours have changed from daytime to nighttime, calculated from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The banking industry starts one hour earlier, from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, with Sundays off. However, the night market situation is also very bleak.</p>
<p>Actively Carrying Out Post-Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Since being continuously bombed on the 28th of last month and the 1st and 2nd of this month, the essence of Yong Port has been severely damaged. Regarding the refugees after the disaster, pacification and relief, the local authorities are now working actively with groups such as the Yong Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Urban Area Has Been Quiet Lately</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, Ningbo also sounded an air raid alarm. Soon, Japanese aircraft invaded Yong territory from the Yuyao direction but did not stop and went east to Zhenhai and out of the county. The 4th was quiet all day. It is rumored that aircraft bombed Shaoxing on the 3rd of this month, but there is no confirmation.</p>

<h3>Wenzhou Resumes Navigation Successfully; the "Hana" Arrives at Dinghai</h3>
<p>Released the Night Before Last, It Safely Reached the Pier; the "Haifu" and "Moufu" are Preparing to Sail</p>
<p>Japanese warships are concentrated along the coast of eastern Zhejiang with some intention. There is a Japanese aircraft carrier in the waters of Wenzhou, and the local garrison is on strict alert. The German merchant ship "Hana" was released the night before last and arrived at Dinghai. The "Haifu" is still planning to sail to Dinghai today, and the "Moufu" is permitted to resume navigation to Wenzhou this morning. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Hana" Released; Telegraphs Arrival at Dinghai</p>
<p>The German Far East Company's "Hana" departed from Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 3rd, carrying more than 600 passengers to Dinghai. On the morning of the 4th, it was detained by Japanese warships in the waters of Dinghai. After the British shipowner argued on the basis of reason and accepted inspection, no contraband was found. It was not until 8:30 PM that it was allowed to be released, and it safely arrived at the Dinghai pier at 9:00 PM. After sailing from Dinghai to Shanghai this morning, the next sailing date is the 8th of this month. The German merchant ship "Haifu" of the Lihe Foreign Company suspended sailing to Dinghai after the "Hana" incident occurred. Today, the "Hana" has been released, so it is still planned to sail to Dinghai at 4:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Lisheng" Returns to Shanghai; "Moufu" Sails to Wenzhou</p>
<p>After the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command was ordered to allow foreign ships to resume navigation to Wenzhou, the British Jardine Matheson Company specially dispatched the "Lisheng" to sail empty from Shanghai to Wenzhou to load cargo and return to Shanghai. Yesterday, the ship telegraphed that it had left Wenzhou for Shanghai on Wednesday (i.e., the 3rd) and would arrive in Shanghai this morning. The German merchant ship "Moufu" of the Lihe Foreign Company is permitted to sail directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning, in addition to loading cargo, and selling passenger tickets. Other foreign shipping companies are all preparing to send ships to sail the Wenzhou port line and the Shanghai-Wenzhou line due to the successful resumption of navigation to Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Qian Dazhao is Not in Shanghai</h3>
<p>His Participation in "Huaxing" is a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>It was reported a few days ago that the so-called "Huaxing Bank" held its founding meeting at the New Asia Hotel on May 1st, and the Chinese participants included Shen Erchang, Qian Dazhao, Zhou Wenrui, and others. According to this newspaper's investigation, Qian Dazhao is still employed as the manager of the Dalian Jincheng Bank and is not in Shanghai. The reported participation of Mr. Qian is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Setting Off Firecrackers During the Lunar Eclipse; the Japanese Side Claims it is a Demonstration</h3>
<p>Even Claiming an Anti-Japanese Organization is Directing it; Has Requested the Municipal Council to Investigate the Matter</p>
<p>The Puppet Mayor Again Raises the Demand to Prohibit the Display of Flags</p>
<p>According to the Dalu News, a Japanese-language newspaper in this port, yesterday (the 4th), the Japanese authorities in this port, on Wednesday evening, observed with "regret" the "firecracker disturbance" caused by the lunar eclipse and have submitted a request to the Public Concession Municipal Council to "investigate this matter." The Chinese setting off firecrackers to commemorate the lunar eclipse is another kind of "anti-Japanese demonstration movement disguised as a superstitious custom." According to ancient Chinese superstition, dragons swallow the moon, and a lot of noise must be made to scare the dragon away. The Dalu News did not consider this fact, but the newspaper criticized this matter, saying that setting off firecrackers was done "systematically," so "it can be considered that there is an anti-Japanese organization behind it" because its "disturbance" is quite organized.</p>
<p>Since the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>it has been strictly forbidden to set off firecrackers, then setting off firecrackers in areas adjacent to Japanese-occupied territories is "deliberate anti-Japanese demonstration movement." The Municipal Council completely disregarded the disturbances on Wednesday, so "it cannot escape the criticism of failing to properly manage the people within its jurisdiction." Another article in the Dalu News regarding this matter stated that the Japanese authorities often take all possible precautions to prevent disturbing people's hearts. For example, the Japanese Marine Corps must notify the Municipal Council every time they practice to avoid</p>
<p>Disturbing the Public</p>
<p>The reporter told the above-mentioned arguments to the police officers of the Public Concession, who said that they regretted that they had not notified the Japanese authorities of the lunar eclipse in advance. Also, "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiao'an yesterday sent a note to the French Consul General, the Public Concession Municipal Council, and the Consular Body, reiterating the demand to completely prohibit the display of Chinese national flags in the two concessions. The "note" to the French authorities was delivered by one of his pawns. The puppet mayor expressed "gratitude" for the attitude taken by the French Concession authorities on April 19 when they conducted the General Mobilization of the Chinese National Spirit and prohibited the display of national flags. Then, he said that unless the French Concession authorities continue to prohibit the display of national flags with the same spirit shown on April 19, he fears that the peace and order of the French Concession may be harmed. The "request" to the Municipal Council and the Consular Body expressed "regret" that the Municipal Council had not taken appropriate measures to absolutely prohibit the display of Chinese national flags to maintain peace and order as he requested. It is also said that there are quite a few Chinese Kuomintang and Chinese memorial days in May,</p>
<p>Arousing Attention</p>
<p>and expressing his opinion that, for the sake of what he calls "peace and order," action should be taken immediately to prohibit the display of Chinese national flags. Also, according to the Dalu News, another complaint was made yesterday on the north bank of the Suzhou River. The "representative" of the "Manchukuo Government" "stationed in Shanghai" expressed indignation at an article about "Emperor Kangde" (Henry Puyi) published in a Russian-language Japanese newspaper in this port, and also claimed that the "Manchukuo authorities" in Shanghai would lodge a strong protest with the Municipal Council about this article. If necessary, they are prepared to take effective and</p>
<p>Appropriate Measures</p>
<p>The newspaper pointed out that an article published by the Russian-language newspaper, the organ of the Soviet Union, was an "unprecedented insult," mentioning the "Manchukuo Empress" as "Puyi's wife," which was a direct insult because the formal name of the "Emperor" is now Kangde. The manager of the Russian-language newspaper issued a statement last night, stating that he acknowledged the article that had been published insulting the "Manchukuo monarch" and also said that the Japanese reports were inaccurate. The statement indicated that legal steps would be taken against the Japanese newspapers.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Refugee Products Opens with Great Success</h3>
<p>Handicrafts are of Excellent Quality; Guests Purchase Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Refugee Product Exhibition, sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Branch of the Yiduya Road, was held at 10:00 AM yesterday at the First Refugee Shelter in the Qianye Guild Hall on North Henan Road and Wenjianshi Road. More than 500 guests and staff of the association attended. The Chinese Women's Relief Association orchestra played national music, and students from the Nandong Middle School sang production songs. Then, Acting Chairman Kui Yanfang</p>
<p>Delivered an Opening Speech</p>
<p>Generally stating that the refugee products exhibition held today has great significance. On the one hand, it expresses the enthusiasm for supporting the central government's promotion of the production movement, and on the other hand, it makes all sectors of society understand the achievements of the association in handling refugee production work. As for the exhibition of this product, it is different in nature from other exhibitions. The quality and quantity of the exhibits, whether good or bad, are displayed, compared with each other, and used for observation. All arrangements are simple and solemn, and no extravagance is pursued. In the past, the association's work focused on the passive aspects of rescuing, sheltering, and providing supplies. The situation will be slightly different in the future, so education, production, and hygiene are all being actively promoted to complete the relief mission. Representatives of the Relief Commission, Huang Hanzhi, Special Commissioner of the First Relief District, Yuan Ludeng, representative of the Relief Association, Guan Gangzhi, representative of the Charity Federation, Chairman Tuan Wen Lanting, Zheng Chengen, Jiang Yiping, and guests Duda and Yu Tiaofu all spoke one after another, praising the achievements of the exhibition. In the afternoon, refugees from various shelters held demonstrations of bamboo and wood work and cotton and wool weaving on the spot</p>
<p>Technical Performances</p>
<p>Open to visitors, it is estimated that no less than 2,000 people attended the meeting today, including enthusiasts</p>
<h3>"Huaxing" Counterfeit Money Used to Pay Customs Duties; Customs Seriously Denies It</h3>
<p>Any Illegal Currency is Refused; the Japanese Side Has Not Lodged Protests or Demands with Customs</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that the "Huaxing Bank" counterfeit money is circulating in the concessions, it has been raging more and more rapidly, but until yesterday, it was not found in this city. It is rumored that the Japanese side will exert pressure to force the Jianghai Customs to allow the use of Huaxing Bank counterfeit money to pay customs duties. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs authorities had a solemn statement, completely denying the various rumors. According to reports, the customs authorities have always limited the acceptance of customs duties to legal and commonly used national currency. Any miscellaneous currency that has not been internationally recognized or legally approved by the government has been refused for a long time. Now that there is no change in our country's currency system, the customs authorities should naturally adhere to their administrative policy. The so-called regulations on the use of counterfeit money that the customs is about to promulgate are all rumors. As of last night, the Japanese side has never made any oral or written protests or demands to the customs authorities to accept "Huaxing counterfeit money."</p>
<h3>The Market is Monopolized; No Pigs Arrived in Port Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than 400 Heads Transported by Train are Still Detained by the "Livestock Market"</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a report from the Fresh Pig Industry Association, no round pigs were transported today. More than 400 heads transported by train are still being detained by the livestock market and ordered to pay a handling fee of 1.1 yuan per head, which was firmly rejected by the cargo owners. As of 8:00, they were still in a stalemate. Since the establishment of the Hongkou Livestock Market, it has repeatedly monopolized the source of fresh pigs, resulting in insufficient supply of fresh pigs. At present, fresh meat has soared to 80 cents per catty and is still not easy to buy. If this continues, not only will the more than 50 pig companies in the city be affected, but also the business of more than 1,000 meat shops will be greatly damaged, and the meat consumption of the city's 5 million people will be seriously affected. It is also heard that the abattoirs in the two concessions firmly refuse to slaughter pigs from Hongkou. The people who were giving relief were all voluntarily purchasing refugee products, such as embroidery, wool, cotton fabrics, and other items, which were quite numerous, as they were not only getting cheap and beautiful daily necessities but also rewarded the refugees for their production, which was truly killing two birds with one stone. Moreover, the exhibition will be held for the academic community to visit tomorrow. It is heard that more than ten schools, including New Asia Middle School, Dahai Middle School, Shanghai Middle School, Daode Middle School for Girls, and others, are planning to visit. The day after tomorrow is a day for the industrial community to visit, and reporters from various newspapers and news agencies will be received at the venue at 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Troops Besiege Beiqiao</h3>
<p>Seizing Many Guns; the Japanese Army Flees in Disarray</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Headquarters in Beiqiao on the Shanghai-Minhang Road was besieged by guerrilla troops again last night (the 4th). The two sides engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat for more than an hour. The guerrilla troops feigned defeat and retreated. The Japanese army, unaware of the ruse, tracked and pursued them. When they reached the vicinity of Zhuanqiao, the guerrilla troops ambushed in the four suburbs surged out. The Japanese army was caught off guard and attacked from the front and rear, with more than 60 killed and 60 wounded. The Japanese army broke through the encirclement and fled in disarray. The guerrilla troops did not pursue and kill them, and returned triumphantly. In this battle, more than 80 Japanese army rifles and two machine guns were seized.</p>
<h3>The Public Concession Municipal Council's Facilities in the Western District of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Number of Police Officers Has Increased Threefold Compared to the Past; More Than 100 Factories Have Been Ordered to Close and Relocate</p>
<p>During the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers this year, a motion was passed regarding the current situation in the area outside the Western Concession Roads. The Director-General of the Municipal Council stated that the directors would take as many measures as possible to improve the situation in the Western District. Regarding this matter, the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council has considered it. The Municipal Council's facilities in the Western District in the past are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Police Affairs</p>
<p>Since the war, the number of police officers serving at night within the area under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council's police power has increased more than threefold compared to the past, which can be said to be sufficient strength. Among the residences of Westerners, there have been no cases of theft since the war. There was only one case of highway robbery in December of last year. There were more cases of theft, but a group of thieves were all from the adjacent areas of the concession, and they returned to their original places after stealing. The places where the thefts occurred were found to be lacking adequate security equipment. Therefore, all households should try to take precautions. If you want to hire a private guard, you can petition the police department. Wire should be installed on the bamboo fences, and the walls should be as strong as possible. The police department has invented an effective and inexpensive method of installing windows, and the public can inquire about it. The gaps in the wire mesh frames at the intersections of the roads have been reduced as much as possible, but the legitimate interests of legitimate businessmen should be taken into account.</p>
<p>(2) Hygiene</p>
<p>In addition to normal sanitation matters, the Municipal Council has hired 150 workers, under the supervision of Western staff, to specialize in improving sanitation in the Western District, such as cleaning refugee shelters, sweeping manure and garbage, filling in sewage ponds, and dredging riverbanks. If a coffin is found, it will be reported to the health department for disposal. The duties of the health department have been greatly increased due to the disposal of corpses.</p>
<p>(3) Fire Fighting</p>
<p>In order to prevent fires, the Fire Brigade conducted an investigation in the area outside the concession roads to determine where there were any dangers, where there were water pipes available, and where there were riverbanks. The method of extracting water from the riverbanks has also been studied. If there are any questions, they will be tested on the spot. A few months ago, the Chief of the Fire Brigade issued a special notice ordering all firefighters to comply with it. Faucets have been added to Columbia Road and Dunxin Road.</p>
<p>(4) Factories</p>
<p>A Western engineer has been hired by the Municipal Council to assist the staff of the Public Works Department in managing factories. More than 100 factories have been ordered to close or relocate to non-residential areas. If it is difficult to relocate any factory in fact, its factory plan must be considered in order to reduce the chance of disturbing the neighbors. The engineer inspects all factories located near residences that are prone to objectionable events once a week.</p>

<h3>Many Foreign Ships Berth in Hankou; the Japanese Side Does Not Allow Them to Sail Downstream</h3>
<p>Hankou's Commerce is Approaching a Standstill; the Yangtze River Waterway is a Desolate Scene</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, more than 12 ships of foreign shipping companies have been forcibly detained by the Japanese authorities and are now berthed in Hankou. Most of them are British ships, two are Dutch ships, and at least one is a Portuguese ship. Some of them have been berthed in Hankou since the outbreak of war in the Yangtze River area, so they urgently need to be inspected, but the Japanese side refuses to allow them to sail downstream. The captain of a British ship left his ship in Hankou and took a third-country gunboat to Shanghai. He told reporters that the ships</p>
<p>Detained in Hankou</p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason. The entire Yangtze River route from Hankou to Shanghai is clearly marked. Now that the season of high water is approaching, there is little danger in navigating in the river. At the beginning of the war, the Chinese army removed the shipping aids in the river, but now there are clear marks that can prove that the Japanese army has replaced these aids. Foreign gunboats and a large number of Japanese transport ships carrying supplies travel to and from the Yangtze River, which shows the waterway</p>
<p>Safe Navigation</p>
<p>If warships and transport ships of 6,000 tons can travel, there must be no danger for merchant ships sailing in the river. The shipping industry in this port believes that the detention of Jiangxing's sailing ships shows the Japanese side's attitude of rejecting foreign shipping. The Japanese authorities seem to be actively engaged in harming the shipping of neutral countries, and at the same time, they do not provide convenience to the ports along the river. The blockade of the Yangtze River has also affected the Jiangxing sailing ships parked in Shanghai, because commerce on the Yangtze River is prohibited. Some of the ships now berthed in Hankou should have been</p>
<p>Inspected Two Years Ago</p>
<p>Hankou's commerce is approaching a standstill. There is too much food stockpiled and there are few people to buy it. The hot summer is approaching, and ice will be a serious problem. The Japanese military authorities have agreed that the ice factories will supply ice to the Japanese army, and the Japanese army will supply coal to the ice factories. So far, the two sides have not yet reached an agreement. The Yangtze River used to have prosperous shipping, but now it is a desolate scene. The waterway from Hankou to Shanghai is quite desolate, and the towns on both sides are also deserted.</p>
<h3>A Notorious Thief Arrested in Hongyunfang on Huage Road; Has Committed More Than 40 Cases</h3>
<p>At 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, the French police suddenly received a secret report that a large number of bandits were hiding in Room No. 2 of the Nanjing Hotel at No. 1 Hongyunfang on Huage Road, and requested that personnel be dispatched to arrest them as soon as possible. Detectives Wang Rusong, Bao Tan Mayizhi, Cao Chuanbiao, and many Western detectives rushed to the address and arrested three men and two women in the room. According to the three men, their names were Yang Changsheng, Chen Fulin, and Chen Rongfu. As for the two women, they were originally prostitutes who were redeemed by Yang and others to become their wives. At the same time, accomplices Lu Awu and a guide girl were arrested in Room No. 28 of the hotel. After being taken to the police station and interrogated strictly, they found a pistol in the attic of a certain house in Fuxingli on Bair Road and admitted that they had robbed the Zhou family at No. 28 Sandefang on Sapo Avenue on April 27. At that time, they robbed more than 50 pieces of gold and silver utensils and jewelry, worth about 2,000 yuan, all of which were sold and distributed to be used without denial. In addition, they confessed to more than 40 robbery cases. The police are still continuing the investigation. After the interrogation is completed, they will be tried in the Second Special District Court.</p>
<h3>Two Convicts Who Attempted to Arson and Destroy the Daobao Museum Appealed the Verdict</h3>
<p>Each Changed to Eight Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Someone attempted to arson and destroy the Daobao Museum at No. 130 Ningbo Road on August 27 of last year, but failed to achieve the goal. Afterwards, the police separately arrested Xia Huisheng and Gao Yongchang, two Suzhou natives, at No. 32, Lane 142, Avenyi Road and Yuyuan Road. Xia was working as a translator at the Japanese-owned Yano, and Gao was a printing worker. The results of the trial by the Special First Court were that Xia Huisheng instigated arson and Gao Yongchang assisted in arson, each sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. The two convicts were not satisfied and appealed to the High Second Branch Court. The judge Yu Hua questioned and ordered the trial to be completed pending judgment. Yesterday, Judge Yu rose to the seat to announce the main text of the decree. The original judgment was revoked, and Xia Huisheng and Gao Yongchang were each changed to eight years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>The Büyire Association Encourages Thrift and Promotes National Products</h3>
<p>Famous People in the City Have Risen Up to Sponsor; Domestic Product Manufacturers Give Preferential Treatment to Members</p>
<p>The Büyire Association, a pure blood organization dedicated to promoting the festival movement and advocating domestic products, has been formally established. Because of its pure purpose and practical work, famous people in the city, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Zhang Shouyong, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Xi Yushu, Xu Jiqin, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xiang Kangyuan, Fang Yixian, Fang Jiaobo, Li Wenjie, Wang Boqi, Chen Jicheng, Pan Xulun, Yan Esheng, and leaders of various schools and groups have all registered their names to sponsor. Major domestic product manufacturers, such as the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Family Industry Society, China Chemical Industry Society, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Wuzhou Pharmacy, China-Western Pharmacy, etc., have also formulated preferential measures for members of the association to purchase goods in order to encourage them to use domestic products. It is learned that in order to increase members' interest and promote domestic products, the association is publicly soliciting domestic product stores and domestic product parts of other stores to participate, but they must be subject to the association's strict review. As for the membership qualifications of the association, all citizens of the Republic of China, regardless of age or gender, as long as they can effectively use domestic products and live a life of frugality, can register to join the association without paying membership fees.</p>
<h3>This Year's Seizure of Opium Will Set a New Record; the Toxic Atmosphere in Shanghai is Pervasive and Consumption Has Increased Sharply; Opium is Transported to Shanghai Under the Escort of Fake "Police"</h3>
<p>According to the Dalu News, I learned yesterday (the 4th) that the Public and the Community's Police Department expects that this year's seizure of Ya Pian will break the record. In the first four months of this year, I have been engaged in searching and seizing 7,800 ounces of Ya Pian. Last year, the total amount seized was 12,500 ounces. Judging from the seizure of Ya Pian, the first month of this year has broken the record, because no less than 4,200 ounces fell into the hands of detectives in this month. The total for April was 1,600 ounces, which is exactly 100 pounds. Although it is rumored that a large amount of Persian soil was transported here by Japanese ships, detectives claim that, as far as they know, there is no Persian soil in the seized Ya Pian, but they admit that various poisons have been mixed with the quality, and there may be a misidentification of Persian soil as North China soil, because its color has changed after being mixed with oil. Persian soil is also known as "red soil" because it is reddish-brown in its pure state. The consumption of Ya Pian has increased this year, but according to the records of the Municipal Council's Toxicology Department, the consumption of Hongwan has fallen sharply. Poor laborers still prefer heroin because it is cheaper than Hongwan. Hongwan has disappeared from the drug market in this port. Those who used to smoke Hongwan instead of Ya Pian before the war are now smoking Ya Pian because of the scarcity of Ya Pian. Anyone can buy an ounce of Ya Pian for 13 yuan. The number of soil lines in the Western District is still increasing rapidly. As soon as one line closes, several lines open. The Xinkangli area on the "Avenue" next to Extesi Ferry is almost entirely occupied by soil lines. Bandits are still active in the Western District, but the Public Concession's Police Department pays little attention to these crimes because the location of their occurrence is far away from their area of jurisdiction. When transporting drugs, they are escorted by fake police.</p>

<h3>Concession Authorities Strictly Enforce Closure of Gambling Dens and Their Access Routes</h3>
<p>Access routes to newly established gambling dens are all blocked. The police are strictly intercepting to maintain public order.</p>
<p>The Public Concession police authorities have recently been strictly intercepting and blocking access routes to gambling dens in the area outside the boundary road in Shanghai West, sparing no effort. The access routes to the "Jielu" gambling den at 626 Haig Road and the newly established Dacheng Company on Connaught Road have been blocked by the Jing'an Temple police. As for 478 Yuyuan Road, the place is an old bar that has been closed for a long time, the house is simple, small, and covered with thick dust. The property is owned by a German. When the police investigated yesterday, the German admitted to renting it out for gambling operations. Regarding 368 Haig Road, the cockfighting venue is a general association jointly run by Chinese and foreigners, hosted by a British person and real estate merchants Wu and Chen. However, there is no one named Liang. The truth is still being investigated by the police. It is heard that if any gambling dens are discovered in the future, the police will continue to strictly enforce closure operations to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Adopted Son Sues Adoptive Parents</h3>
<p>Requests Confirmation that Termination of Adoption is Invalid. Defendant Denies Coercion and Reschedules Hearing.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhibu, a local resident of Ben Dui at 13 Jiqing Lane, Dunhui Road, Shanghai West, is 24 years old this year. He recently appointed lawyer Ge Cheng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against his adoptive parents, Zhang Jibao (52 years old, from Changshu) and Zhang Yue (51 years old, the two defendants reside together at 4 Ganba Lane, Huizhan Street, Xujiahui), seeking confirmation that the termination of the adoption relationship is invalid. It is alleged that the defendant couple adopted the plaintiff as</p>
<p>an adopted son</p>
<p>in the Tianzhutang (Catholic Church) in the third year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Recently, as the adoptive parents, namely the defendants, own biological son grew up, they despised the plaintiff. In December of last year, they even forcibly drove the plaintiff out, leaving him with nowhere to settle. Helplessly, the plaintiff complied with the defendants' conditions, giving 6,000 gold to terminate the adoption. On January 14 of this year, the defendants colluded with detectives and resorted to fraud and coercion, signing a termination of adoption</p>
<p>agreement.</p>
<p>He was allowed to return home at 9 o'clock that night, and the plaintiff signed a receipt for 6,000 yuan. At that time, he was tricked in every way, asked to sign first and then pay, and urged to sign quickly, but not a single cent was given. When it came to collecting the money at night, only a termination of adoption paper was handed over, and then a receipt for 600 yuan was forcibly imposed. Only then did he read that the termination of adoption document stated that he was not allowed to engage in improper behavior and was not allowed to practice the candle-making</p>
<p>craft</p>
<p>that he had learned since childhood.</p>
<p>In this way, the plaintiff's reputation and life are in extremely difficult circumstances. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 92 and 98 of the Civil Code, he requests a judgment confirming that the termination of adoption is invalid. The court, according to the complaint, summoned them for a hearing in the Civil Seventh Tribunal by Judge Li Liang yesterday morning. The plaintiff arrived in court with his lawyer and stated the previous situation. The defendant couple both testified that the plaintiff voluntarily</p>
<p>severed</p>
<p>the father-son relationship and was given 600 yuan. The agreement was made in Room 22 of the Dadong Hotel, with one witness for each party and lawyers Zhou Yu and Lu Zhongqi present to sign and certify. The original mediators, Xiang Peizhen and Zhang Qi, were also present to testify. There was no coercion or promise of 6,000 yuan. After verifying the statements in court, the hearing was rescheduled for the 19th.</p>
<h3>One Member of the "Chicken Stripper" Gang Sentenced to One Year and Eight Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Many Children's Clothes Were Found Hanging Up. It is Hoped that the Owners will Go to the Police Station to Claim Them.</p>
<p>Chen Zhihong, a Chinese detective from the Lao Zha Police Station, recently arrested Zhou Hongda, a native of Anhui, a member of the "chicken stripper" gang specializing in robbing children's clothes, near Edward Road and Zhejiang Road. It was found that Zhou had committed numerous crimes, and many children's velvet sweaters and thirty or forty pawn tickets were found hanging up. The items pawned on these tickets were all children's clothes, but the victims had not reported them to the police station, so the owners could not find them. It is hoped that the families of those who have lost clothes will go to the Lao Zha Police Station as soon as possible to claim them. The criminal Zhou was prosecuted in accordance with the law by the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, at the First Special District Court. Under questioning by Judge Meng Tingke yesterday morning, Zhou was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Fake "Municipal Government Secretary-General" Su Xiwun Resigns</h3>
<p>Su Xiwun, the Secretary-General of the pseudo-"Municipal Government" in Shanghai, has always been incompatible with the pseudo-mayor Fu Xiaoan due to conflicts in their powers. All of Su's subordinates have been rumored to have been dismissed one after another, making Su feel increasingly isolated and helpless. Su's only confidant, Lu Ying, was also rumored to be pampered and bought off. Seeing that things were going this way, Su felt bored and submitted his resignation to Fu. Although Fu outwardly tried his best to retain him, he actually wanted Su to leave the pseudo-"government" long ago. It is heard that after Su leaves his post, his backer, Xicun, will find a better and more lucrative position for Su.</p>

<h3>Apprentice from Money Shop Carrying 5,000 Yen Encountered Robbers on the Way</h3>
<p>It Was Found to Be the Work of a Japanese Merchant, a Salesman from the Waida Foreign Firm. Four Criminals Were Arrested and Two Handguns Were Confiscated.</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Kyuda Import and Export Firm, located in the Zhongxing Building at 89 Fuzhou Road, had dealings with the Xiangkang Money Shop on Sichuan Road. On the 3rd of this month, the Xiangkang Shop suddenly received a call from Kyuda, requesting that 5,000 yen be sent to the firm immediately. The shop ordered apprentice Wang Yunxiang to send the money. But just as Wang arrived at the</p>
<p>Zhongxing Building</p>
<p>a bandit grabbed Wang into the men's room on the second floor, threatened him with a gun, and robbed him of all 5,000 yen. After reporting to the police, it was found that Kyuda had not notified Xiangkang to send money. The phone call was also made by the gang of bandits. So, an investigation was immediately launched. Until the day before yesterday, Lao Zha Police Station detective chiefs Pang Ruiqing and Ren Jiaju</p>
<p>received a tip</p>
<p>that Hou Zengshi, a Nanjing native and a salesman from the Kyuda Foreign Firm, was a major suspect in the case. So, at around 1:00 PM that afternoon, Hou was arrested on Yu Qiaqing Road. Under questioning, Hou confessed that he had lost a large amount of money in various gambling dens in Shanghai West for several days, and his debts were piling up. He had no way to make up for it, so he had no choice but to</p>
<p>collude with friends.</p>
<p>Zhang Cai ting from Anhui, Wang Cheng from Lu, and Guo Jingru from Zhenjiang came up with this strategy. Wang managed to obtain two handguns. After the confession, Pang and the two detectives rushed to the Beijing Apartments at 439 Yongbo Road in the French Concession, where they arrested Zhang, Wang, and Guo. Inside the Beijing Apartments, they found a Mauser pistol with seven bullets and a Browning pistol with nine bullets. As for the stolen goods,</p>
<p>5,000 yen</p>
<p>were taken away by another person named He, who is now at large. The four criminals, including Hou, were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer, Jiang Baokang, requested that they be temporarily detained for investigation. Judge Feng Shide approved the request and ordered that Hou and the other three be detained for one week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Deceased Annamese Constable Given Solemn Burial Yesterday with Full Honors</h3>
<p>Nguyen Quang Du (transliterated), the Annamese constable who was shot and killed by robbers on Shijian Road in the French Concession, was buried yesterday afternoon at the Xujiahui Cemetery. The Director-General of the French Concession Police Department, Fabre, personally officiated the ceremony. The French Consul General, Bauduy, representing Consul Brault, was also present. Those who attended the ceremony included the Director-General of the French Municipal Council, Bladier, the French Defense Force Major, Fabre, Gaston, the Commander of the French Concession Volunteer Corps, Leroy-Beaulieu, the Superintendent of the French Municipal Council, Tegoutier, senior officials of the French Police Department, police chiefs of various police stations, and representatives of various groups.</p>
<p>The honor guard</p>
<p>consisted of one French constable, four Chinese constables, and cyclists leading the way, followed by those holding flowers and the French Police Department band. A row of Annamese constables escorted both sides of the coffin, and four rows of Annamese constables and two rows of Russian constables formed the honor guard. The coffin departed from Talas Road and proceeded via Fuli Road and Ladu Road to the Xujiahui Cemetery. After the funeral, the Director-General of the French Police Department personally placed the gold medal awarded posthumously by the French Consul General on the coffin and recounted Nguyen's praiseworthy qualities, which could serve as a model for future generations. The main points are as follows: "Although the book of honor already contains many records of personnel who died in the line of duty, another glorious name is now added. When Annamese Constable Nguyen Guang Du</p>
<p>valiantly defended against two robbers</p>
<p>he sacrificed his life but was able to protect his firearm and prevent it from falling into the hands of evil men. This is highly commendable. Moreover, since he joined the police force, he has been loyal and dedicated for more than eight years. Furthermore, he was determined to resist to the end and was unwilling to be disarmed, thus demonstrating the inherent virtues of loyalty, courage, and fortitude of the Annamese people. People like Nguyen can make the residents of the concession have more confidence in the spirit of protection by the police officers. The</p>
<p>gold medal</p>
<p>awarded posthumously by the French Consul General is placed on his tomb. After the ceremony, it will be transferred to his family for safekeeping, so that his descendants can look at the object and reflect on the spirit of their ancestors who died in the line of duty as unattainable." Subsequently, Annamese constable representative Tang Junguang gave a eulogy. The solemn funeral then ended in silent mourning. The wreaths sent by various parties included the French Ambassador to China, the French Consul General, the Chairman and all directors of the French Municipal Council, the Director-General of the French Police Department Fabre, the first military officer of the French forces stationed in Shanghai, the French Concession Special Patrol, the French Municipal Council personnel, the teachers of the Annamite School, and the various police stations of the Police Department, etc.</p>

<p>The Owner of a Gauze Shop</p>
<h3>Keeping a Mistress in a Gilded Cage - The Secret is Revealed - The Old Wife Reports it to the Police, and Both are Arrested - Trouble from Now On in the Family.</h3>
<p>A certain Wu, the owner of a gauze shop in the Zhonghui Building on the south side of Edward Road, is in his sixties. His wife, Dong, is also already white-haired and tottering. In the family, orchids and magnolias compete in beauty. His ancestral home is Ganpu, but he has lived in Shanghai for many years. The shop was founded by Wu himself. Because he is skilled in business, the business is very developed. Today, he is almost the leader in the industry. He has accumulated considerable wealth. Although he has achieved fame and fortune, he still takes care of the store affairs and family affairs himself, not even slightly entrusting them to his wife and children. However, Wu,</p>
<p>although old in age,</p>
<p>is still strong in energy. Eight years ago, he met a beautiful woman in the Wenying area. At that time, she was twenty years old and had not yet married. Wu felt that she was truly worthy of love, so he seduced her with sweet words. In Qing, she was moved by his wealth and devoted herself to him. After Wu obtained this young beauty, to prevent interference from his legal wife and ridicule from his children and grandchildren, he kept the location of his mistress strictly secret. For several years, neither his family members nor friends knew about it. Wu was even more</p>
<p>solemn and dignified</p>
<p>to his juniors to cover up his affair. Unexpectedly, recently, the secret was suddenly revealed. The location of the mistress's residence, the front building on the third floor of the house at number 144 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, in the Public Concession, was suddenly discovered by his wife. She also found out that since Wenying had lived with Wu, she had given birth to a son, who is now seven years old. In terms of ages, Qing is already three-nines. So, without making a sound, after 10:00 PM on the 24th of last month, knowing that Wu had gone to his mistress, she reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, accusing her husband</p>
<p>of committing adultery</p>
<p>and requesting an investigation. The police chief sent detective Zhang Keqin to the address. After confirming the facts, Wu and the group of men and women were taken back to the police station for questioning. At this time, Wu's sons and daughters, upon hearing the news, could not take sides because the creators of the incident were their own parents. However, they could not stand idly by. Under the principle that the matter could not be easily resolved and without going against reason and feelings, they first entrusted lawyer Wu to go to the police station that night to declare that this was a</p>
<p>family dispute.</p>
<p>After the police chief questioned them, he temporarily allowed the arrested persons to leave and wait for further investigation. After Wu and others returned, Wang Wenying deeply hated that Wu had initially used deceptive means to cause her this humiliation, and furthermore, her status was obviously problematic. In order to protect her own survival and that of her son, she has now officially started negotiations with Wu. Wu's wife, Dong, has also made demands on Wu these days, asking Wu not to</p>
<p>have any further relations</p>
<p>with Qing from now on, and requesting that all property rights be handed over and managed by her and their children. As for the various points raised by Wu's wife and mistress, he is still considering them separately. It is difficult to predict whether he will accept them or reject them, or even cause a lawsuit. In short, this is a complex and complicated matter.</p>

<h3>Husband Maliciously Abandons</h3>
<p>Abandoning Wife and Children, Disregarding Their Livelihood. The Defendant Failed to Appear in Court, and the Hearing Was Rescheduled.</p>
<p>Li Xudezhen, a Suzhou woman residing at 38 Fuxing Lane, Fukang Road, Xinzha Road, is 33 years old this year. She recently hired lawyers Fan Gang, Huang Qiying, and Qian Xingzhong to sue her husband, Li Boxiang, for abandoning her and her children in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The reason for the lawsuit is roughly as follows: The plaintiff was engaged by her parents in her hometown in her childhood. In the 21st year, the defendant Li Boxiang saw that the plaintiff was somewhat attractive and used the excuse that he was unmarried</p>
<p>to express his willingness to marry.</p>
<p>He used all sorts of flattery and took her to live together first. He followed the defendant's instructions and went to his hometown to go through the procedures for dissolving the marriage contract. At the beginning of their cohabitation, she found out that he already had a wife, who was critically ill. When she argued with him, the defendant swore that he would never treat her as a concubine and would not abandon her halfway. Because he was sincere and because her original marriage contract had been dissolved,</p>
<p>she wanted to repent but could not.</p>
<p>She could only endure and live with him until now. They have had four children in succession. Recently, the defendant's attitude suddenly changed. He often scolded her for no reason and often abused her. He only gave her 10 yuan a month for daily expenses, and he ignored the children's tuition fees and clothes. Even when the children were sick, he was unwilling to pay for medical treatment. The plaintiff's sister-in-law came to live with them to avoid the war, and the defendant</p>
<p>made sarcastic remarks</p>
<p>and spoke harshly from time to time. Later, he also treated the plaintiff as a stranger. On April 5 of this year, he further insulted and abused her. The next day, he drove them all out. After sending a letter to urge him to raise the children, he disappeared, making it impossible to meet him. Examining his behavior, it is clear that he intends to abandon the plaintiff and her children, leaving them to roam outside. However, the plaintiff has no means of self-help, and the children are all young,</p>
<p>urgently awaiting nurture</p>
<p>and protection. Now, the defendant deliberately abandons them and does not provide for their livelihood and protection, which is a crime under Articles 293 and 294 of the Criminal Law. He should be severely investigated in accordance with the law. This case was heard by Judge Fu in the Criminal Second Tribunal yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear, and the plaintiff's lawyer Huang Qiying presented the case. The court decided to reschedule the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<h3>"Peace Under Heaven?"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The resignation of Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov has sparked much speculation in many countries, with numerous commentaries, each seemingly logical and irrefutable. Naturally, I also have some opinions. My opinion is that the world will henceforth be at peace (?)!</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that Litvinov was the one disrupting the peace, and that his departure will bring about peace. Rather, I believe that his departure may be due to Stalin's perception that Europe is no longer a problem, or at least, that the Soviet Union no longer needs to be involved as a pawn for other countries. This lack of problem in Europe does not mean that the roots of disaster have been eradicated, or that there is a long-term solution that everyone is following. It means that Britain and France, particularly Britain, have reached an agreement with Germany and Italy, especially Germany, and everything can be discussed at length. This "length" may not refer to the length of the matter itself, but rather the length of time. Based on this spirit of compromise, coupled with the length of time, making concessions and discussing matters calmly, the Soviet Union has no room to intervene, nor is there any need to intervene. If Litvinov didn't resign, how would he explain himself? If the Soviet Union didn't withdraw, how would it explain itself?</p>
<p>I am not making this statement entirely based on speculation. A Reuters dispatch from London explaining the suspension of collective security organization negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union cites four reasons that can serve as the basis for my statement: first, Chamberlain declared that he would not encircle Germany, but was "happy to consider" a "mutual guarantee" between Britain and Germany; second, there is a possibility of "friendly negotiations" between Germany and Poland; third, Germany has proposed non-aggression pacts to the Nordic countries; fourth, relations between Italy and Britain and France have improved, and they are unlikely to fight alongside Germany. If such wishful thinking comes to fruition, wouldn't the world be at peace? If the world can achieve peace in this way, why engage in collective security organizations, which are ruthless and bloody, and simply invite trouble?</p>
<p>However, can the world truly be at peace from now on? A few weeks ago, I discussed the "inconclusive" situation in Europe, and ultimately made a definitive statement that things would not end well. Now, I still hold this belief: Litvinov's resignation can be seen as a sign that the Soviet Union will not participate in Central European disputes and will take a wait-and-see approach. It can also be seen as a subtle indication that Britain and France do not need the Soviet Union and are reaching a compromise with Germany and Italy. However, this is like a malignant tumor. Although it may not fester or cause pain for the time being, its toxicity remains, and it will eventually erupt. Moreover, because of repeated delays and the failure to excise it earlier, the eruption will only be more severe. At that time, Britain and France will still be in a panic, and will still seek help from the Soviet Union. Whether the Soviet Union will come out again to be exploited and sacrificed remains a question.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if the world is to be truly at peace, at least Europe must be truly at peace, and that can only happen with a genuine alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. However, Britain and France do not seem to be interested in this, so I can only hope that my observations are wrong, and that the world will indeed be at peace!</p>
<h3>Night Watch</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>——A Fragment of Militia Life</p>
<p>The dark night stretches out vast and wide before one's eyes. The desolate countryside is utterly silent, eerily quiet, with no fields or villages to be seen, and no human voices or loud calls to be heard. Looking up into the distance, one sees only a black expanse; the trench extending along the railway line merges with the ground.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, the night watch militiamen advance towards the trench; although the path requires groping due to the darkness, there are no real difficulties.</p>
<p>Groping along the railway line, reaching the trench, crawling forward, in an instant, passing through the entire trench, reaching the end; following the guard post, keeping watch.</p>
<p>In the trench, imagining an unceasing invasion, taking the mountain peaks, huts, and groves ahead as Japanese aircraft launching a night attack. We are not negligent in our defense because we are in the rear; nor do we relax our vigilance because it is dark; only strengthening our reconnaissance and steadfastly guarding! The drifting clouds in the sky, the sparse groves, the flickering lights, the faint sound of the wind blowing through the grassland, all leave clear impressions on our minds. A group of people's bravery, composure, and vigilance fully demonstrate a robust fighting force.</p>
<p>Everyone pricks up their ears, listening to the night rhythms flowing forth from the silence, listening to the rise and fall of natural music in the sky. In this cold and desolate countryside, although there are no bursts of gunfire, the thought of the battle scenes on the front line makes our hearts leap!</p>
<p>At this moment, a faint sound suddenly came from the mountain gully. We shone a flashlight, and three blurry figures immediately came into view. Urgently, raising our voices, we shouted a password, but they ignored us. We shouted again, and they finally asked "Password" in return. When we answered with the first half of the password, they couldn't answer the second half and fell silent.</p>
<p>"No password?" A group of people went from suspicion to tension, jumped out of the trench, and ran to surround them; many beams of flashlight light focused on the three people, who immediately stopped moving and shouted the password:</p>
<p>"Last"——"Victory"</p>
<p>The password was exchanged, and upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the training officer and the chief of staff from the brigade headquarters, who had come specifically to inspect and test our defensive spirit. The other person was an orderly. After saluting, the training officer smiled and asked us, "If you were actually on the front line on night watch, what would you do if you encountered people without a password?"</p>
<p>"Surround, search, disarm, and escort them to..."</p>
<p>The training officer nodded. Continuing to smile, he said, "The most important thing is: alertness and communication; sight and hearing must control the situation; only run when you should advance quickly; even if separated from command, you must be able to act independently."</p>
<p>Returning to the trench, standing at our posts. We once again earnestly revisited the hope in our hearts: perhaps our strength will achieve something on a certain position and fulfill the joy of victory?</p>
<p>The night grew deeper and darker, and the wind grew stronger. Looking up at the sky, due to the gradual increase in natural modulation, we realized that the first half of the night had passed. When the second shift of night watch militiamen groped their way to relieve us, we still felt attached to the trench even as we embarked on our journey home.</p>
<h3>A Dream Beyond the Heavens</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>The annoying weather makes it impossible to stay indoors; being idle, I pace back and forth in the garden. I discovered that the grass is green, and the flowers are red; for those who are busy all day long, this is an "unexpected discovery," like finding a clear stream in the desert, nourishing a parched heart.</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have been living a mechanical life, rushing here and there at high speed; other than feeling warm, I hardly knew the change of seasons. Discovering it in the garden by chance is naturally a special feeling. For example, finding a fresh and beautiful rose on a barren road will surely conjure up a beautiful story or a moving poem; these are the dream materials for my "Dream Beyond the Heavens." The so-called "Dream Beyond the Heavens" is the story I concocted after accidentally finding traces of spring in the garden.</p>
<p>The passing of winter is like a piece of ice gradually melting in a warm hand; there may be a lot of black sand in the ice, but after it melts into water, the black sand will leak out in the water droplets. The spring breeze is precisely the palm that scatters the black sand. I hope that all the black sand from the previous season will leak away piece by piece in the spring, letting a pure white world come to life.</p>
<p>Dreams are often the mother of reality, and often a fascinating net. I remember when I was little, I once took a nap on the green grass, and when I woke up it was already dusk, I caught a chill and got sick. Now, I'm stealing a nap on the green grass again.</p>
<p>So, I got this dream beyond the heavens. In the universe of meditation, I discovered another beautiful world, and when I woke up, the setting sun was infinitely beautiful.</p>
<p>The dream is over, and the story I concocted has also come to an end.</p>
<p>Isn't it? Dreams are often the mother of reality; but first you have to break free from this "fascinating net." Outside the net is living clear water, a free world.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, it made me hum a low tune again.</p>
<p>First Movement</p>
<p>I lightly sing the sound of the future,</p>
<p>Rippling in the aroma of wine.</p>
<p>The skirt of the goddess of hope,</p>
<p>Fluttering over my shoulders.</p>
<p>Second Movement</p>
<p>What color is hope,</p>
<p>What taste, what shape?</p>
<p>You turn your head and soar into the clouds,</p>
<p>Leaving me a burst of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Third Movement</p>
<p>I no longer look back with longing,</p>
<p>The past is a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>Flying and dancing lightly with the wind,</p>
<p>Drifting to the distant horizon.</p>
<p>Fourth Movement</p>
<p>Sing, four lines of light tones,</p>
<p>The low-pitched, tender and winding melody!</p>
<p>Infinite affections have deceived:</p>
<p>The little pearl of spirit on my heart.</p>
<p>Coda</p>
<p>Faraway travelers, on their hearts—</p>
<p>Tears cannot be exhausted, shining on the image of golden spears!</p>
<p>Perhaps this "Low Sonata" can be considered the dregs of life; but I hope this is also a slight trace brought by the dream beyond the heavens, let the endless spring breeze blow it away!</p>
<h3>Spring Sleep Unaware of Dawn</h3>
<h3>Leading by Example</h3>
<p>— Chen Kangbai</p>
<p>This is not a popular term, but an iron rule for those who bear a "model role."</p>
<p>A person who truly matches "words" and "deeds" will surely handle everything properly, whether at home or in public service. Conversely, if your words and actions are disconnected, no matter how beautiful your words are, no matter how movingly you speak, once the moment passes, everything will be over. Some people will even say behind your back, "He's just talking!"</p>
<p>If a parent can always consider the influence on their children in their diet and daily life, and always take "leading by example" as a prerequisite in their dealings with people, then their children, needless to say, will naturally be humble, courteous, selfless, and group-oriented. In the past, Mr. Fan Xiweng devoted his life to public service and generously helped the masses, so his several sons were able to carry on his legacy and carry forward their father's career. This is simply because they were influenced by what they saw and heard, and transformed imperceptibly.</p>
<p>If a government official truly does "If it is not mine, I will not take even a hair," then his subordinates, without having to constantly exhort them with parched lips and tongues, will naturally be modest and self-respecting. Confucius said, "Wealth and rank attained by unrighteousness are to me as drifting clouds." That is why, when he was in charge of Lu for three months, the state of Lu had the good achievement of "no one picking up lost items on the road." Moreover, among his many close disciples, there were very few who just thought of scooping things up and counting them as their own. This is also the effect of "leading by example," not just the result of "fearing the summer and Chu punishments."</p>
<p>Zhao Tong became a model commander of a guerrilla force during the Anti-Japanese War, and I believe that this was mostly due to the influence of his mother, who was rich in nationalist thought. Otherwise, if Zhao Tong wanted to do that, and his mother always used her old life to stop him, it would have been difficult to carry out the smuggling of military supplies and secret organizations so smoothly in such a difficult environment in northeast Hebei.</p>
<p>Xie Jinyuan repeatedly fought bravely in the battles of Shanghai, always leading by example. His loyalty and righteous spirit of defending the country can move heaven and earth and startle ghosts and gods. Therefore, his subordinates were also able to regard death as homecoming and see the nation as heavier than Mount Tai. The contrasting terms "Eight Hundred Lone Soldiers" and "Four-Row Warehouse" have now become proper nouns in the international arena.</p>
<p>However, after the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the heroic deeds of Chinese civil and military officials like this are truly too numerous to count. Anyone who pays a little attention to the newspapers can often see similar records. This is mostly due to the inspiration of the central government's upright national policy. At the same time, it can also teach the other side that the freedom of the Chinese nation and the territory and sovereignty of the Republic of China are absolutely inviolable and absolutely not to be plundered.</p>
<p>The other side does not think of the saying "Those who commit many unrighteous acts will destroy themselves!" They have taught their people with their acts of aggression and massacre, and their deceitful words, and in the future they will eat their own bitter fruit. There have been many such precedents in the history of the world.</p>
<p>However, to bring the discussion back, I believe that the four words "leading by example" must not only be clearly written in the depths of our minds during the current National Spiritual Mobilization, but we must also firmly remember them in the future period of peace. Only in this way can everything be done well! Only in this way can we accomplish anything! Only then can the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation be completed!</p>
<p>This,——"leading by example"——is indeed not a popular term, but an iron rule for those who bear a "model role."</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice Price Limit Relaxed by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Geng Fifteen Yuan, Superior Xian Fourteen Yuan, Saigon Rice as High as Eighteen Yuan and Fifty Cents</p>
<p>The national rice market, after breaking the fourteen-yuan price limit the previous two days, with high-grade Geng exceeding fifteen yuan, presented a stormy scene again yesterday after the market opened. Superior Xian immediately rose by four or five cents, and the situation became increasingly chaotic. Seeing this situation, the market committee members knew that it could not be left as it was, so they immediately took measures and had no choice but to notify the industry to temporarily suspend trading. In the afternoon, they convened a meeting of seven rice and grain groups to discuss solutions. As a result, there was no market yesterday. In the afternoon, the rice and grain groups discussed the results at the Miscellaneous Grain Association. They believed that the fourteen-yuan price limit had been in effect for two months, but due to the current factual difficulties, the price limit was temporarily broken. The reason for this was that the sources of supply from various inland routes were mostly blocked, and the price of unpolished rice had risen sharply. It was said that if Wuxi was under the monopoly of a certain party, only five carts, or 750 bags, were allowed to be transported out each day. Areas such as Changshu and Jiangyin have not yet been cleared. In addition, in Songjiang County, a certain party has a Chengji foreign firm that collects goods independently, and on the other hand, prohibits them from being transported out of the country. Moreover, they arbitrarily release rice prices and then force sales. As a result, the price of unpolished rice in the area has reached 12.8 to 13 yuan, and the price of original white Geng rice has reached 13.5 to 13.6 yuan. If this rice price is combined with the Shanghai market, it must be sold for 15 yuan or more. Not only is this the case in this area, but it is also the same in other areas. Therefore, cargo owners in Shanghai had to try their best to sell at high prices in order to protect their capital, which created this kind of market situation. The association has never stopped trying to curb this, but considering all aspects, it must also take into account the difficulties of merchants' operations, so it was decided to temporarily allow a relaxation of one yuan. The price of high-grade Geng rice is limited to fifteen yuan, and the highest price of Yangdu superior Xian and other superior Xian is limited to fourteen yuan. All will be dealt with separately. All rice merchants and firms are required to strictly comply. However, if private sales and dark market transactions still exceed the price limit, once the investigation is confirmed, the Market Committee and the Evaluation Committee will impose severe fines, which will be used as refugee donations. On the other hand, a notice will be sent to the British and French Municipal Councils and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for record, etc. (The 15-yuan price limit is equivalent to 17.65 yuan per old sea picul.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer Xian rice from shop storage had a strong appetite. Due to the suspension of the market, the retail price of this street shifted its spirit to foreign customer Xian rice, so the price was raised again and again. High-grade goods rose by three or four cents, and medium-grade goods rose by five or six cents. Nanjing Xian has broken through 14 yuan, and Wu Xian has also reached around 14 yuan. The cargo side is optimistic and supports the price. More than 4,000 bags were traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice attracted the attention of the shops and storage on this street, and the market suddenly became tense. High-grade Saigon rice rose to 18.5 yuan, and medium-grade rice was also close to 18.1 or 2 yuan. The warehouses have low inventories and high prices, and they are all sticking to their positions, so the transaction volume is still less than 1,000 bags. However, foreign prices are rising. Yesterday's telegram from Saigon was about 2 yuan, which is still 1.5 yuan short of being able to place an order.</p>
<h3>Factory Prices Too High, Local Flour Sales Turn Weak</h3>
<p>Wheat Factory Operations Virtually Stalled</p>
<p>Flour: The rising trend in the Japanese spot flour market has temporarily subsided. The customer sales market, after being active once the day before yesterday, was weaker yesterday. Because factory prices have been raised again and again, and there is no large amount of spot flour supply, customers are also less enthusiastic. Moreover, foreign flour and foreign wheat have both arrived in Shanghai recently. In order to take into account the competition from foreign flour, the factory side has no intention of raising prices again. As a result, it is still supplied at the original price. In addition to retail transactions on this street, customer prices still fluctuate by 5 to 2.5 cents. The total transaction volume is more than 40,000 bags, and the overall market is gradually trending towards a rotating state.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, sources of local wheat gradually arrived in small quantities. Transactions are still light. At present, the Australian wheat, etc., that foreign firms have arrived with have all been allocated directly to factories in batches. Because the factories still have sufficient foreign wheat raw materials, the demand for local wheat is weakening. Apart from sporadic purchases at the door, they generally do not purchase from the market.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Handling War Damage</h3>
<p>— Lu Shanshi</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the occupied areas have been reduced to ruins, and most industrial and commercial enterprises have been affected. Although the extent of the damage varies, it is imperative to seek relief and plan for post-war recovery. Accountant Xi Yushu of this city previously prepared an opinion on this matter and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. Recently, he received a reply. Accountant Xi added supplementary measures and publicly announced them. Industrial and commercial enterprises are deeply concerned about the significant impact on their own interests and are paying close attention to and actively discussing them. The author believes that there should be a concrete method for dealing with war damage to be followed. However, the content of this method should be carefully considered to ensure thoroughness. If the measures are inappropriate, they will have an adverse impact on the industrial and commercial community. Therefore, I will not hesitate to make a humble contribution and offer my views for discussion.</p>
<p>It is found that the contents of Mr. Xi's proposal and the Ministry of Economic Affairs' reply include, first, treating war damage as deferred assets, and using annual profits to amortize and offset it. This point is the most important. Regarding this method, we believe that it is somewhat simplistic and may be difficult to follow uniformly. At the same time, since war damage is treated as deferred assets, and it is specified that it must be amortized and offset with annual profits, the wording seems somewhat ambiguous. The term "deferred assets" is originally a specialized accounting term. According to accounting methods, the amortization of deferred assets must be carried out during the settlement. In other words, the amortization amount of deferred assets must be listed as expenses first, and then the net profit is calculated, rather than calculating the net profit first and then engaging in amortization. Therefore, if war damage is handled as deferred assets, then its amortization and offsetting should not be done from annual profits. But if the amortization and offsetting should indeed be done from profits, then war damage cannot be treated as deferred assets. Therefore, according to the original literal meaning, it is not clear how to deal with war damage. However, based on the limitations on the amortization period shown later, it seems to refer to the fact that the amortization and offsetting should be carried out before the settlement. This is because the calculation of income tax is originally based on net profit. Whenever there is a profit, tax should be paid, so why bother considering the amortization period? Below, please first discuss whether war damage can be treated as deferred assets.</p>
<p>The term "deferred assets" in accounting is translated from the English word "Deferred Assets." The word "Deferred" originally means to postpone or extend. In accounting, for some prepaid expenses, their benefits may be extended to the coming year. At the same time, this type of expense should not be borne by the current year. Therefore, it is temporarily treated as an asset, so that its benefits can be extended to the coming year, and also so that the expenses that should not be borne by the current year can be transferred to the coming year. Its meaning is profound, and its method is very good. Therefore, for expenses such as prepaid rent and prepaid insurance, it has been generally recognized in accounting that they are deferred assets. However, for start-up expenses, doubts inevitably arise as to whether their benefits can be extended and whether they should be transferred to the coming year for burdening. Therefore, even among scholars today, opinions have not yet been unified on whether to recognize them as a type of deferred asset. Now, the occurrence of war damage is completely unpredictable beforehand. Moreover, after it occurs, there are no benefits that can be extended to the coming year, nor is there any reason to argue that it must be borne by future years. It is a definite loss and cannot be compared with prepaid expenses. This is very obvious. This is one point that is considered worthy of discussion from an accounting theory perspective.</p>
<p>Any business, in order to achieve sound development, should make capital replenishment its top priority. The way to replenish capital is that, in the active aspect, there should be a large amount of public accumulation, and in the passive aspect, there should be no inflated assets. The Company Law stipulates that a reserve fund must be set aside for the distribution of profits; it strictly supervises capital contributions in the form of assets other than money; it prohibits the issuance of shares at a discount; and the general practice of merchants and income tax laws encourage low prices for asset valuation: all of which are intended to make the capital of the business tend to be sufficient. Now, in terms of war damage, the original assets have obviously been lost, and the capital has obviously been eroded. However, if it is still allowed to be retained as an asset on the books, it obviously violates the principle of capital replenishment. I fear that the result may not be able to alleviate the current difficulties, but it will be greatly harmful to future attempts to self-renew. This is the second point that is considered worthy of discussion from the perspective of business financial management. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Finance: Cash Transactions Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market situation for cash red copper suddenly turned calm. There was nothing exciting to report along the way. The difference between the rise and fall was only two yuan. The price stayed around 2,108 yuan throughout the day. However, the opening situation in the morning was slightly weak. Later, a certain gold firm (acting on behalf of the Xiamen gang) and a certain money exchange business successively absorbed purchases, which caused a slight rebound. However, the result was still a fall of two yuan. Trading was flat in the morning, with only about 350 taels transacted. In the afternoon, it was heard that buyers were bidding 2,107 yuan, but sellers were only willing to supply at the noon closing price of 2,109 yuan, so there were no transactions. There were no changes in silverware jewelry. The price of English pure gold rebounded upwards.</p>
<p>Black Market for Cash Red Copper Falls Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the market situation for each bar (ten taels) was slightly weak. Initially, money exchange businesses traded 50 taels with each other, with the opening price of 2,107 yuan, which was four yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, a certain gold firm, acting on behalf of the Xiamen gang, absorbed purchases at low prices. Silverware gangs and other businesses each bought 50 taels, with the prices all the same as the morning opening. Then, the silverware gang absorbed 50 taels from the gold firm, at a price of 2,108 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business sold 50 taels to the silverware gang, at a price of 2,107 yuan. After that, another money exchange business started a buying spree, causing the potential to gradually increase. It absorbed 50 taels from other businesses, at a price of 2,108.5 yuan. Then, it bought another 50 taels from other businesses, at a price of 2,109 yuan. After that, there were sellers but no buyers, so no transactions were made. Therefore, the noon closing price was still 2,109 yuan. In the afternoon, supply and demand became even scarcer. There were only a few buyers, bidding 2,107 yuan. However, sellers were only willing to supply at the noon closing price of 2,109 yuan. Both sides maintained their positions until after 4 pm, but no transactions were made. If calculated according to the noon closing price of 2,109 yuan, the result was a fall of two yuan compared to the closing price of the previous night. The selling price of cash firms' own brand gold was 2,115 yuan, and the buying price was 2,100 yuan. The spot gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, but no transactions were made.</p>

Demand for foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, was slightly reduced, and prices fell with the weakness of the bullion market.

<h3>Securities - Foreign Debt Declines</h3>
<p>— Land Reclamation Stocks Soar —</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt prices on the 4th of this month (Thursday) fluctuated from 5 shillings to 1 pound.

The rest remained unchanged. There were 2,000 pounds of Crisp loan bonds sold in the London physical market at a price of 37 pounds, an increase of 1 pound compared to the market.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Exchange stock market was very strong and active, with land reclamation stocks having the largest trading volume. Because the company announced a final dividend of 4 jiao for the end of 1938 and distributed one new Jiangli share for every five shares, the stock price rose to 8.5 yuan. Later, many profit-takers sold, and the price softened to 8.35 yuan, which was also the final transaction price. If the dividend and bonus shares are excluded, the stock is equivalent to 6.625 yuan. Shanghai Silver Company rose to 6.15 yuan due to the large investment in land reclamation stocks. Jardine Matheson shares were traded less frequently, and prices fell slightly. There was still investor demand for tram and bus shares. Ruirong common stock was priced at 7.4 jiao, and Yexong stock was priced at 106 yuan, both of which still had demand. Jardine Matheson shares were again strong, with transactions at 36.5 yuan. There were more buyers for rubber shares, but prices were low, and few shares were sold.</p>
<h3>Textiles - Light-Colored Fabrics Experience Sudden Surge in Street Sales</h3>
<p>East Textile Fine Cloth Plunges by 5 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's market still showed no progress in actual sales. Holders were nervous because there were a large number of internal and external scattered hoarding households in the market, and the market was very chaotic. Small transactions were reduced by about 1 jiao per piece. The general market trend remained flat. Wholesale business in the interior, such as Subei, Bengbu, and Wuxi, was still good. Transactions mainly involved light-colored goods, bleached cloth, poplin, standard cloth, white ground printed cloth, linen gauze, satin, and other goods, totaling more than 2,000 pieces. There were more than 50 pieces of colored cloth, white goods, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. Shantou's loading of goods slightly recovered, but new purchases were still scarce. Although the shipping routes to Ningbo and Dinghai in eastern Zhejiang were open, customers loaded very few goods. North China's Tianjin continued to handle more than 100 boxes of poplin, striped bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and printed goods. Weihai handled 40 to 50 pieces of white goods and coarse cloth. Chongqing suffered heavy bombing by Japanese aircraft, and the purchasing intentions of customers in Sichuan and Yunnan were greatly affected. Uncompleted goods were temporarily postponed. Due to the suspension of parcel acceptance by the post office, Fujian's handling of goods was also stagnated. Due to the hot weather, the retail business on this street suddenly surged in light-colored printed cloth, satin, and linen gauze, with products from the Lun Chang factory being the most popular. On the 6th, 220 pieces of cloth were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>East Cloth</p>
<p>White goods continued to soften. In the morning market, sales of fine cloth and fine twill were suppressed by the short selling of peers. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth once plummeted to 14 yuan, falling sharply by 4 or 5 jiao. Later, due to the dragging of local dyeing factories and bullish peers, it gradually rebounded, and the evening market was 14.35 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Fine twill also fell by 1 to 2 jiao. No one talked about the business of customer groups. The goods absorbed by the northern groups had not yet been digested, and external hoarding households felt more and more stuck as prices fell. Therefore, only local peers and dyeing factories completed more than 800 pieces throughout the day, but the local mindset still looked high.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Bulls Control the Yarn Market, Price of Warehouse Receipts Approaches Spot</h3>
<p>The yarn market has already fought off the price drop. Actual transactions are rare. General speculators are still bullish, and the chips they drag into the market fluctuate in and out, very busy. Some peers are all in bullish positions and are absorbing huge amounts. Based on the above situation, although the yarn stored in each warehouse is full, the market price is becoming more and more expensive. Although actual demand is stagnant and cannot be exported, sales are not only not loose but are advancing steadily. This is because there are many hoarders on the island. However, since the past two days, the market situation has been that warehouse receipt transactions are strong, so it can be imagined that there are many floating transactions and few actual sales, so the price distance between spot and warehouse receipts is close again. In the afternoon, only 20 bales were sold to the interior, and the turnover of the peer football transaction was 1,060 bales. At the beginning of the morning market, peers had some wait-and-see attitude, the market was quiet, customer demand was also normal, and sellers were slightly more active. The opening price of the Matan warehouse receipt was 415.5 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan from the previous day. Spot yarn was more relaxed because customers did not have a large appetite. After a while, the sellers flocked again and fell by 1.5 yuan to 414 yuan, but no spot prices were seen. At this time, the market was calm, and then some buyers appeared on the market, and a certain Kang character firm entered dozens of bales, so the sound of buying resumed, and the transaction was very small. The price of the warehouse receipt was made to 417.5 yuan, and the spot price was 422.5 yuan. The price of the warehouse receipt and spot was only 5 yuan apart. In the afternoon, the customer sales were safe and lacked energy, and the opening was flat. Later, it was said that the price of Japanese yarn was good, and it was suddenly raised by 2 yuan. The price of the warehouse receipt was 419 yuan, and the spot price was 425 yuan. All were peer transactions. The total number of bales bought by each group throughout the day was 2,320 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 1 to 2 yuan, Tiannv was tired by 1 yuan, Shuangdiqiu was good by 3 yuan, and the rest rose by about 2 yuan. The factory opened 500 bales of 20-count Tiannv from Shenxin Factory, priced at 410 yuan, from May to June. Today, 950 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin. The previous day, there were also 532 pieces of yarn ends transported to Europe. The amount of each group's purchase is as follows:</p>
<p>Peers 1980 Hong Kong 65 Shantou 120 Mainland 150 Xiamen 5 Total 2320</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has stabilized slightly. Because after the short squeeze last month, many accounts have not yet completed the procedures, so the number of people in the market has greatly decreased. The morning price of 20-count Yueqin was 373.5 yuan, and the afternoon price rebounded one step.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Export Subsidies Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Rises Sharply, Local Cotton Trade Dull</p>
<p>The external cotton market price, the New York cotton market first rose slightly due to the good Liverpool telegram, the number of opponents of cotton export subsidies is increasing, the House of Representatives, therefore, this proposal did not get two-thirds of the senators' consent, so it refused to implement it. Recently, cotton sales have slightly improved. At this time, the new cotton has not yet appeared on the stage, and the government loan cotton has not been released. The city market is short of old cotton, and peers have slightly traded, causing a rise. Yesterday, the New York near-term was good for 2 pounds, the far-term was unchanged, India, including the forecast, rose by 3 rupees, creating a new high price in the past three months, Egypt rose by 20 pounds, converted to legal tender, cotton prices have all risen, calculated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 1 jiao, Indian cotton rose by 1 yuan and 1 jiao, and Egypt rose by 1 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has gradually eased in recent days, but yesterday Indian cotton rose sharply, and the transaction volume was slightly inferior. However, yesterday, the factories ordered a total of 5,000 bales, including 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, whose fiber is mainly used for spinning 20 counts. Japanese factories also purchased 3,000 bales of Indian cotton, all to be shipped in June. The converted factory price of yesterday's cotton market is listed below:</p>
<p>The local cotton business has slightly improved, but the factory appetite is still closed. Peer trading has slightly increased, so the market price has not increased significantly. However, the selling price of foreign cotton has risen recently, and the flower number is frequently in and out. As for Chinese and foreign factories, they are still searching in the market, mainly Indian cotton. Therefore, the local cotton trade is extremely dull. However, the source of each route is interrupted, and there is a lack of goods, so the general situation is in a dilemma, almost a stalemate. Based on the above situation, it is difficult to grasp the situation of the new cotton this year. There were 328 bales of Tongzhou cotton from Subei. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake - Rumors of 4,000 Barrels of Soybean Oil Arriving Soon</h3>
<p>Raw Oil Transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai, Market Sentiment Affected</p>
<p>The soybean oil market situation was affected by rumors that 4,000 barrels of Songpu Maru were being transported and could arrive soon, resulting in market sentiment being sluggish and appetite sharply reduced. The city only traded 50 barrels of Dalian barrel oil and 30 barrels of white squeezed oil, with prices all opening at 44.5 yuan, and 50 barrels of Fengnian oil at 43.5 yuan, a further decrease of 1 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Since raw oil was transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai, the market sentiment has been greatly affected. Sales channels only have scattered sales such as this street, and transactions also rise and fall abruptly. It is easy to fall and difficult to rise due to oversupply. Yesterday's market transaction was not made.</p>
<p>Recently, the price of soybean oil has risen from 25 to 6 yuan per dan last year to a peak of 47 yuan. Yesterday, the reporter met with people in the oil industry and asked about the reason for the sharp increase. According to reports, since the fall of Songhu, most of the Chinese-owned oil factories in the city have stopped due to the interruption of raw materials and the difficulty of working in the occupied areas. Even if one or two Chinese factories barely started, the amount of goods produced was not enough to supply even one-tenth or two-tenths of the market. Oil merchants had no choice but to start trading with Japanese merchants from the beginning of the old calendar last year, and they were still at peace. Until March 31 of this year, this port suddenly received a telegram from Dalian, saying that the Japanese side controlled exports, and soybean oil was also on the list. As a result, incoming goods were suddenly blocked. It was later learned that the Japanese side could export soybean oil, but it was necessary to convert Japanese currency to shillings before being allowed to be sold in Shanghai. However, if shillings were used, the cost per dan would have to reach 49 yuan. However, the oil merchants in the wooden market had ordered a total of more than 30,000 barrels from Dalian Japanese merchants for April and May, so the Japanese merchants did not deliver the goods. Although the oil merchants in this city repeatedly negotiated with Dalian, there was no result. Mitsui only allowed 18%, Mitsubishi 38%, and other Japanese foreign firms did not deliver any barrels. Therefore, the oil merchants in this city had to adopt a compromise method for the collection and delivery of the same industry and oil merchants in the interior, and they would all deliver the goods at 11%. The amount of oil in this city was in short supply, and a sharp increase occurred suddenly. The above situation is not actually oil merchants hoarding, or deliberately violating the contracts of interior Shantou merchants, but is affected by the Japanese control and the desire to use shillings.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains - Raw Peanuts Have Continued to Arrive</h3>
<p>Raw peanuts have been extremely short due to lack of continued arrival. There are now 800 to 900 bags arriving by sailboat. The top-grade goods are directly called 25 yuan, and the second-grade ordinary are called 18 yuan, a total of 300 to 400 bags. The rest are still under negotiation. On the previous day, 2,360 bags of raw peanuts were exported to Europe.</p>

The Dutch telegrams, the recent seven and August is 10.5 Dutch shields, the London telegram is eight shillings and four pence for May, seven shillings and seven pence and twenty-five for August, six shillings and seven pence and a half for December. The Hong Kong telegram is 21 yuan for coarse white including the cost of the bag to Shanghai delivery.

<h3>Procedures for Applying for Passports from the British and French Consulates in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Anyone who goes abroad to travel, study, or pass through a second country to our country's interior, the first step is to apply to our country's passport issuing agency for an exit passport. The procedures for applying for a passport have been described in detail in the second issue of this journal, so it is not necessary to repeat them. Now what is described is the procedure for requesting the consulate of various countries here to add a transit or entry signature after obtaining a passport.</p>
<p>(A) France</p>
<p>Since the land and water transportation from Hong Kong to the interior has been cut off, the only way to go to the interior is to take the French Indochina and then follow the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, so the number of people requesting the French Consulate to add a transit signature through Vietnam has been increasing. The consulate has become stricter in the procedures for requesting a signature because there are too many people requesting it. The procedures require that the obtained passport, guarantee letter (this letter can be written in Chinese, with the name of a local reliable store or business, and the content roughly writes the passport holder's place of origin and occupation, and that the economy is sufficient to supply all travel expenses, and in the event of economic hardship in Vietnam, our firm dares to guarantee 100 Vietnamese dollars per person, etc.), two photos (must be the same as the photos attached to the passport), smallpox and epidemic prevention certificate (must be issued by the Health Department of the British and French Concession or Dr. Xu Xinbai to be valid). All of the above items must be submitted to the French Consulate in person, and a application form must also be filled out there. The passport, doctor's certificate, and one photo are submitted, and the other guarantee letter and one photo will be placed in an envelope prepared by the consulate, which will be sent by the passport holder to the Politics Department on the third floor of the Lujiawan Patrol Room in the French Concession, which will send someone to the guarantor there to investigate. If it is considered qualified, it will report to the French Consulate. The consulate signs the passport based on that report. The transit signature fee is 10 francs (equivalent to 2 yuan in national currency). It takes about two weeks to complete this signature procedure. If you are going to Europe to travel or study and want to pass through France, it is much easier to request a signature. As for the procedure for requesting an entry signature, it is roughly the same as the one described above, but the guarantee letter is very serious. If it is considered not very qualified, the passport holder will be ordered to prepay a deposit of 200 Vietnamese dollars, which will be refunded upon departure in the future. The signature fee is 75 francs. The above refers to French Vietnam. Those who go to France to travel and study are not in this case.</p>
<p>(B) United Kingdom</p>
<p>The procedure for requesting the British Consulate to add a signature to a passport is slightly more complicated. If you are going to study, the passport holder must have a certificate issued by the principal of the alma mater from which they graduated or attended. If there are letters exchanged with British schools, bringing them with you can add another layer of proof for going to study in the UK, which is more appropriate. As for the economic guarantee level, it is best to have an economic guarantee letter from a local British foreign firm manager or reliable store. The entry signature fee is 10 shillings and 6 pence in English gold. It is very easy to request a transit signature. The signature fee is only about 3 yuan in national currency. For Chinese people who go to the British Malay Archipelago and its Straits Settlements and want to request a signature on their passports, they only need to verify a letter sent from the destination to be signed. Recently, the consulate has re-promulgated regulations for adding signatures to passports because the number of people going there has increased and the quality is uneven. It has been implemented since April 25 of this year. The general situation of its regulations is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All Chinese people going to the Malay Archipelago and its Straits Settlements must first ask the British Consulate for two application forms, fill them out item by item according to the prescribed format, and must indicate the name, occupation, and address of the guarantor at the destination for investigation.</p>
<p>(2) The filled out application form is sent by the consulate to the official at the destination written by the applicant to investigate, and the official reports back to the consulate here based on the facts. If it is considered qualified, the passport will be signed.</p>
<p>(3) The round trip for this passport procedure takes four weeks. If you want to speed it up, you can only use telegrams, which takes two weeks, but the telegram expenses must be paid by the applicant in advance, with the surplus being refunded and the deficit being paid.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong and Bangkok Aviation</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>British Imperial Airways has dozens of giant seaplanes and a very strong lineup. The route is almost all over the world. There are two main lines. The southern line starts from London and ends in Durban, South Africa. The eastern line starts from London to Sydney, Australia. There are also many branch lines distributed in various places. Now, as far as its Far East branch line is concerned, the company's original route was from Hong Kong to Bangkok. Recently, given the large number of passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Hanoi, Annam, and then to the interior, the company started on the 14th of this month, every Friday The plane flying from Hong Kong to Bangkok stops in Hanoi, Vietnam. The ticket price is 9 pounds in English gold for a one-way trip and 16 pounds for a round trip, the same price as French Airlines. From May 1 of this year, the company increased the originally set ticket price. The new ticket price is 14 pounds in English gold for a one-way trip and 25 pounds for a round trip. From Hanoi to Hong Kong, the ticket price is calculated in francs, 250 francs for a one-way trip and 4500 francs for a round trip. The free baggage is still 25 kg, and the excess is one shilling and five pence per kg. Although the ticket price has increased, passengers are still happy to take it because the company's aircraft is huge and more safe and comfortable. The company's aircraft that departs every Friday only has three seats for passengers going to Vietnam. Therefore, anyone who plans to take the company's plane from Hong Kong to Vietnam should book it with the company one week before departure, otherwise they may not be able to get a seat. Also, according to the price list of French Airlines' Hong Kong-Vietnam route, it is still sold at the original price and there is no news of price increases.</p>

<p>According to reliable information, pilot Dietel set a new unprecedented flight record last month on the 10th, achieving a speed of 746.6 kilometers per hour. Dietel was piloting a Heinkel fighter plane equipped with a Daimler-Benz engine, and the ignition system and spark plugs used were Bosch brand. Furthermore, the cars that won the Grand Prix auto race held on the 2nd of this month in Pau, southern France, all used Bosch ignition systems and spark plugs. In addition, the world speedboat speed record was set by Italian man Muranti, whose speedboat, Augustus V, achieved a speed of 121.66 kilometers per hour. The spark plugs installed in the speedboat's engine were also Bosch brand. With such achievements, it is no wonder that Bosch spark plugs are reliable and widely praised by daily users.</p>

<p>Increase in Passenger Ticket, Luggage, Parcel, and Freight Rates</p>
<p>The Southwest Highway Bureau has increased passenger, freight, and luggage transportation prices, effective April 16 of this year. Passenger tickets have increased to 5 fen (national currency) per seat per kilometer. Luggage transportation costs 3.5 li (national currency) per 5 kilograms per kilometer. Therefore, the ticket price from Kunming to Guiyang, a distance of 662 kilometers, has increased to 33.1 yuan. Luggage costs 2.317 yuan per 5 kilograms. From Guiyang to Chongqing, a distance of 488 kilometers, the ticket price is 24.4 yuan, and luggage costs 1.708 yuan per 5 kilograms. From Guiyang to Changsha, a distance of 1009 kilometers, the ticket price is 50.45 yuan, and luggage costs 3.027 yuan per 5 kilograms. From Guiyang to Liuzhou, a distance of 632 kilometers, the ticket price is 31.6 yuan, and luggage costs 1.896 yuan per 5 kilograms. Ordinary parcel rates are the same as luggage rates. As for freight rates, charges are divided into less-than-truckload (LTL) and full-truckload (FTL). For LTL shipments, the rate is 7.2 hao per 10 kilograms per kilometer for first-class goods, 6.6 hao for second-class goods, and 6 hao for third-class goods. All classes of goods have a minimum weight of 10 kilograms and increase in 10-kilogram increments. The minimum freight charge is 2 jiao. For FTL shipments, the rate is 6.6 jiao per ton per kilometer for first-class goods, 6 jiao for second-class goods, and 5.4 jiao for third-class goods. All goods are calculated based on the weight loaded on the truck. When the loaded weight exceeds the truck's carrying capacity, the unit is incremented by 25 kilograms; amounts less than 25 kilograms are also calculated as 25 kilograms. The freight rate is also calculated proportionally. The minimum freight charge per ton is 2.5 yuan, based on the truck's carrying capacity. In addition to freight charges, there are also loading, unloading, storage, late fees, shunting, and empty running fees. The loading and unloading of LTL goods, luggage, and parcels must be handled by the Road Bureau; shippers are not allowed to handle it themselves. The charge is calculated per kilogram, with a fee of 5 fen charged for every 20 kilograms. For FTL shipments, loading and unloading can be handled by the shipper; otherwise, it is calculated per ton, with a fee of 2 yuan charged per ton. For FTL shipments transferred for transportation, late fees are waived if completed within the specified time. If the time is exceeded, a late fee of 1.5 yuan must be paid for every 30 minutes or fraction thereof per ton. If the goods arrive at the station outside the specified time, a storage fee of 2 yuan per ton must be paid for every 24 hours or fraction thereof. Transportation of LTL goods, luggage, and parcels is calculated per kilogram, with a fee of 1 jiao charged for every 20 kilograms. When requesting shunting for loading or unloading outside the station, the rate is 4 jiao per kilometer per vehicle, with a minimum charge based on 5 kilometers. Furthermore, if a dedicated vehicle is requested for transportation and the return trip cannot be utilized, an empty running fee of 4 jiao per kilometer per vehicle must be paid.</p>

<h3>Reconstruction and Relocation</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Zhenshan)</p>
<p>The difficulty in properly allocating the value and supply and demand of real estate in Shanghai has evolved to a rather alarming extent, and the resulting rental frictions have evolved from simple subletting by second and third landlords to collective disputes. The conflict of interest between the head landlord and all the tenants has recently become like a rising storm. In recent days, the issue of reconstruction and relocation has been making headlines in newspapers, with some people crying and begging, some calling for help, some entrusting mediation, some resorting to law, some wiring the Executive Yuan to seek relief, and some expressing gratitude in the newspaper for successful mediation. It's really all kinds of things.</p>
<p>What is the root cause of these phenomena? In a nutshell: there are fewer houses than people. Nearly five million people are crowded into a corner of the concession, and many of them are petty bourgeois who have come from all over. They only seek a house to settle down in, and the high price does not matter. Coupled with the speculation of the owners, this has created an unprecedented high rental record, especially in terms of "transfer fees" and "extra expenses," which can easily reach thousands of dollars, which is not surprising. As a result, the owners' way of making money has invisibly emerged, and at the same time, their methods and approaches are also invisibly improving.</p>
<p>Based on this realistic situation as a basis for judgment, and speaking from an objective point of view, the reason why the head landlord wants to reconstruct is not because the houses are old and uninhabitable, nor is it because of the appearance of the city, but to increase the production of capital. The reason why tenants are unwilling to relocate is not to deliberately make things difficult, nor is it to be obsessed with the house, but because there is no house to relocate to.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard from people familiar with the inside story that the reconstruction of a house not only does not cost money, but also the income from the new rent can reach more than double the old rent. For example, a house that currently rents for 80 yuan a month can be reconstructed for thousands of yuan. After reconstruction, the monthly rent can be raised to 200 yuan (the internal equipment is more complete than this number). At the same time, the tenant can also be charged a "tip" equal to the cost of construction. In the current situation where people are overcrowded, even if it is rented out in this way, the general public is still flocking to it, and even before the house is completed, it is declared "full." In this way, isn't it easy to increase the rent by 120 yuan per month? (There are many other ways.) May I ask, if the rent is increased suddenly without reconstruction, it is not only factually impossible to increase it to this number, but also human feelings, common sense, and public opinion would not allow it. Therefore, once the owner has the idea of reconstruction, no matter how you cry, how you kneel, and how embarrassing and pitiful the shape is, it will be of no avail, because the only thing in the minds of the general public is money. With the sovereignty in hand, displacement is naturally someone else's business. It seems to have become a law that only those in the same class and environment in a realistic society have sympathy.</p>
<p>Looking at the difficulty of finding a house, we want to advise the general public that if you encounter a house reconstruction and must relocate, it seems that you do not need to make a plea that is equivalent to seeking skin from a tiger, nor do you need to make an empty "please help from people in society." It is better to make your own plans as soon as possible. The "escape" of the petty bourgeoisie does not necessarily have to be in the "isolated island." The interior is a good place to go, no matter where you can settle down. It is absolutely impossible for houses to be as difficult to find as in Shanghai, and for house rents to be as high as in Shanghai. If the general public who fled to Shanghai all shifted their direction to flee to the interior, then they would not be threatened by the house, and Shanghai would naturally not have the phenomenon of social unrest caused by reconstruction and relocation.</p>
<h3>Terror of the "Isolated Island"</h3>
<p>— Ma Ge</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Three Smart Girls"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Three Smart Girls Grow Up"</p>
<p>"Three Smart Girls" is the sequel to "One Hundred Flowers." Deanna Durbin has already had a crush on Melvin Douglas (in her youth) from "One Hundred Flowers." Nan Grey and Helen Parrish, who are the same age as her, have naturally "grown up" like flowers. Therefore, in this sequel to "One Hundred Flowers," "Three Smart Girls," we are told a more "romantic" story than "Adolescence."</p>
<p>At Deanna Durbin's birthday party, the eldest sister, Nan Grey, was engaged to Richard. However, the second sister, Helen Parrish, was heartbroken. Deanna Durbin brought a handsome young man, Harley, from the conservatory. Her intention was to introduce him to her second sister. Harley did not understand her "painstaking efforts" and expressed his love to the eldest sister. This complex situation finally led to Deanna's passionate appeal to her father, who turned the mistake into a success, completing the mission of "matching envoy." In this romantic story, the playwright really has a little intention to tell the parents of the world that they should pay attention to their children at all times and fulfill their educational duties. However, under the support of director Henry Koster, this only attempt disappeared like a bubble. When the father said to his staff, "Go home and pay attention to your children," this sentence was completely extinguished in the light and lively "matching work" of the whole film.</p>
<p>Now let's describe Henry Koster's masterpiece as follows: (1) After introducing the "Three Smart Girls" on stage behind the scenes, he launched Deanna Durbin's birthday party. At this banquet, he introduced Deanna's singing voice in various aspects; the eldest sister's engagement; the second sister's sadness; and the father's concentration on his career. In this lively scene, he clearly outlined the whole film, and this approach is very good. (2) Later, Deanna Durbin invited Harley to dinner at home in the conservatory; Harley attended the dinner; and the final wedding scene were all handled in a lively and humorous manner, and were comprehensive in all aspects, worthy of being a master of comedy directing. (3) The characters of the father (Charles Winninger) and Deanna Durbin were also captured very tightly: such as at the birthday banquet, the father was late, saw the guests being perfunctory, forgot to take off his coat, and forgot his shoes after changing into his tuxedo; in the scene where Harley attended the dinner, he took off his coat and put on Harley's coat, and when Deanna was determined to talk to him, he was busy with business calls, etc., and wrote a true and lovely character who was focused on his career and did not ask about others. Deanna Durbin's naivety and liveliness are her characteristics, and Henry Koster further emphasized her girlish heart, such as knowing that the eldest sister was engaged, she was so happy that she told everyone, "The eldest sister is engaged!" When introducing Harley to the eldest sister, she told him, "She is already engaged!" The depiction of the girlish heart is very thorough. (4) The depiction of the sisterhood of the three sisters: such as Deanna Durbin secretly watching the second sister burn her diary; trying her best to set up a meeting between the second sister and Harley; the sisters talking together in bed; and the weeping of the three sisters after misunderstanding that Deanna was in love with Harley, etc., were also very touching.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin's songs, as far as I, a layman, can hear, are not as good.</p>
<h3>Paradise for Jews</h3>
<p>— Xia Luo</p>
<p>Before the first color film in the Soviet Union, "Nightingale Song" (now renamed "Female Warrior"), we saw a rare newsreel: "Jewish Autonomous Region".</p>
<p>Speaking of Jews, we will not forget that they are regarded as inferior people and are being abused and killed by the Hitlers. It has become commonplace for this group of stateless people to be insulted and damaged. It has also become "a matter of course" for their lives and property to be destroyed, for the reason that they are Jews.</p>
<p>However, in a corner of the world, in the territory of the Soviet Union, this group of people without a homeland has an autonomous region, which is our neighbor, just across the Heilongjiang border from our country. There, they are allowed to speak their own language. They farm, work, and mine gold there. They use their labor and intelligence to demand rewards from the earth. They no longer have to worry about being attacked at any time and anywhere, because this is their autonomous land.</p>
<p>What are our thoughts after watching such a newsreel? What will the Jewish refugees who are wandering in various countries around the world and are being taken in by the good intentions of various democratic countries think? After watching this newsreel, the Jewish refugees in Shanghai expressed their longing for it in their own newspapers.</p>
<p>I am not Jewish, but when I see those people who are living diligently in the peaceful air (which is protected by the unparalleled power of the Soviet Union), I cannot help but yearn for it. From this, I also think of the reclamation areas in the southwest and northwest that we are currently cultivating and developing. There, our compatriots are also building our paradise with redoubled hard work. Are there any of these scenes in "Four Hundred Million Compatriots" (a newsreel that faithfully records our country's war of resistance) made by the famous news photographers Zoliss Iven and Hebo Clen?</p>
<p>People who love peace will never forget to build their peaceful gardens even in the midst of bloody storms, although they will not forget to use force to defend their gardens, and the unity of all peace-loving people in the world is the only way to prevent invaders from breaking in.</p>
<p>Extend our hands of friendship and express our sincere friendship to our neighbor across the Heilongjiang River. Your experience of having gone through oppression best understands the cruelty of the fascists, which can only be dealt with by hitting the aggressors.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 9: Bearing the Pain and Suffering, Tears Fall in All Directions; Practicing Thrift and Diligence, Working Hard on Ten Acres</p>
<p>Everyone thought that this group of star dramatists, who were used to a life of luxury, could not endure hardship. Who knew that they would organize many drama troupes the next day, willing to abandon everything in Shanghai and prepare to flow to all parts of the country to awaken the people's anti-war emotions. This Mr. Jin, their group organized the Second National Salvation Drama Troupe, leading male and female actors, with a total of seventeen or eighteen people. At this time, there was a cultural circles national salvation association in Shanghai, and there were various groups under the association, and the drama troupe was also one of them. Those drama troupes were all departing for the interior. Mr. Jin's group only collected five yuan per person as travel expenses, hired a small boat, and secretly left Shanghai along the Suzhou River. Among these seventeen or eighteen people, there were men and women, old and young, people from the working class, poets, cartoonists, and photographers, but now they were all a drama troupe. When they arrived at a place, they would put on a play, whether it was a city or a village. In the city, they could naturally borrow a theater or a public place to perform. If it was a village, many were in remote areas, and they could put on a play wherever they were. They traveled around, passing through eight provinces from Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, and gave seven hundred and several tens of public performances. Sometimes they had to walk hundreds of miles over mountains and ridges, and they also had to carry their own bedding. When they arrived at a place, there was no place to sleep, so they slept on the ground. If they had pancakes and fried dough sticks to eat, it was considered very good. The men didn't care, but there were also women. At that time, there was a Ms. Wang in the same drama troupe as this Mr. Yu. She was originally a delicate young lady who had studied in Japan and had a good knowledge of literature. She was also a famous star in the Chinese film industry. Naturally, she had to wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury. But at this time, she could also wear rough cloth clothes. Sometimes, in order to cross mountains and ridges, the clothes were torn by thorns and had several patches, but she wore them without thinking it strange. This shows that a person's ambition, if he thinks about the big picture and the high level, those minor decorations and other things are really not worth worrying about. When they arrived at a place, they would put on a play. When they arrived at a place where workers gathered, they would put on a play for the workers to see. Like when they arrived at the Daye Mine, they would put on a play for the miners to see, fulfilling their obligations without asking for a penny. When they arrived in the Dabie Mountains, they would put on a play for the brothers of the guerrillas to see. Sometimes, their drama troupe would meet wounded soldiers returning from the front line on the way, and they would put on simple makeup on the way and put on a few short plays for them to see.

<h3>Impressions of "Hairpin Phoenix"</h3>
<p>— Lord Ke Yun Lou</p>
<p>The other day, I happened to visit the Golden Theater and listen to Ms. Zhu Chen's "Hairpin Phoenix" play. This play was a masterpiece of Lord Liu Xiang Guan. I had seen it several times before when I visited Shanghai. Its sadness and beauty were moving, making people's intestines and stomach churn. This time, Ms. Zhu Chen added Cheng's singing style, singing it with a twist, and it felt particularly interesting. Her description of the characters' life experiences in the play can be described as vivid and thorough. The harvest was good, which was unexpected. I love to write miscellaneous things to share with my fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Guan Shengxi practiced cross-dressing as Mother Lu, and her singing was strong and well-trained, with a mature and prudent style and no anger. In the dialogue with Miaokong (played by Ma Fulv) in the temple, her appearance of listening to false rumors and being extremely surprised and desperate was very similar in sound and appearance. Hui Xian gave loyal advice, but lost her mother's favor, and was often blamed and beaten. However, she admired the poet (played by Ye Shenglan) and was determined to have no other. When she met Fangweng privately, her words were ambiguous, and she wanted to say something but stopped. She was charming and charming, and her expression of pity and cherishing jade with Shenglan was truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>Zong Shicheng met in the garden, which was the most exquisite part of the whole play. Fangweng's accidental encounter with Huixian in the garden was a surprise and a state of grief and indignation. Shenglan's performance seemed a bit excessive. Since ancient times, literati and writers have endured adversity and must express their emotions in poetry. At that time, Fangweng encountered such a situation, so he wrote the "Hairpin Phoenix" poem. What was his inner depression and pain like?</p>
<p>Huixian read the original "Hairpin Phoenix" poem and set the tune to Qingyin, which was elegant and commendable. Unfortunately, the pitch was a bit high, which caused the original sound to be lost and there was a suspicion of being too assertive. In the slow plate of Erhuang Qiyan, Zhu Chen's singing has reached the realm of perfection and pure fire. On this evening, Zhu Chen sang, and as the strings of complex and fast sounds, high and low, were free, the words were not chaotic. From beginning to end, she did not show exhaustion, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>At the last farewell, when she fainted, she heard the sound of "Xiaotang Ming". Fangweng was getting married, vaguely, whether it was sadness or joy, she was about to fall ill, her intestines were broken and her soul was scattered, and her dialogue with Fangweng, Zong Shicheng, and others was a farewell. One word, one tear, was extremely sad, and she sang "Erhuang Sanyan" and two sections of Sanban, like pearls running on a jade plate, with each grain sounding, like weeping and complaining, sad and sorrowful, shaking people's hearts. I forgot to return, and looked around the same seat, and everyone was in tears. Although the script was moving, the protagonist's performance was both sound and appearance, and that's why.</p>

<h3>Zha Ruilong Returns from Traveling</h3>
<p>— Fu Zheng</p>
<p>He: The patriotic fervor of overseas Chinese... is like the surging tide.</p>
<p>He said: Determined to resist the war... donations are even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Zha Ruilong, a martial arts star and strongman in the early Chinese film industry, is a name that people are familiar with. The year before last, he led the Guoguang Art Troupe to perform in the Philippines. Now, he has returned from his travels. During this time, he promoted the cause for the motherland to the overseas Chinese and performed voluntary performances to raise funds, doing his best. The author recently had a conversation with him, and the following is a brief record:</p>
<p>Performing Skills in the Philippines</p>
<p>Mr. Zha has quite a reputation in Southeast Asia. He has been to Siam, Singapore, and other places. This time, he traveled to the Philippine Islands, and because of the excellent skills and dance of the Guoguang Art Troupe, he won the welcome of the overseas Chinese and foreigners in those places. It took more than a year before he returned. Compared to Wei Yingbo and others who were unsuccessful in foreign lands, Mr. Zha and his companions have reason to be pleased.</p>
<p>Serving the Country</p>
<p>When Mr. Zha was performing in various places, he felt that when the country was in trouble, as a citizen, one should do one's best to do something beneficial for the motherland. Therefore, he promoted resistance to the war to the audience at any time and performed more than a dozen voluntary performances. The proceeds were entirely handed over to the Overseas Chinese Anti-Enemy Association and presented to the motherland for the purpose of rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees. Mr. Zha talked about the passionate patriotism of the overseas Chinese, which was like the surging tide. Their enthusiastic donations have greatly helped the motherland in its resistance to the war.</p>
<p>Tropical Treasures</p>
<p>He usually has a passion for raising tropical fish. This time, he personally experienced it, and every time he went to the coast, lakes, and marshes, he deliberately searched. After a long time, he obtained a very rich collection of fish, aquatic plants, live small snails, snail shells, and strange stones from the seabed. This time, these tropical treasures added a lot of color to his luggage. There are also several kinds of aquatic plants that have never been seen in Shanghai. There are more than a dozen left-handed snails, colored purple, coffee, and jade. Ordinary snails are all right-handed, so this kind of left-handed snail is even more precious. There are more than a hundred kinds of snail shells and strange stones from the seabed, and their shapes and colors are different. There is also a pair of jade-colored peacock fish, which are completely transparent. They are currently in the breeding period, and the features of the small fish in their abdomen can be clearly seen. This is truly the wonder of nature. In the near future, Mr. Zha plans to borrow a suitable place to hold a voluntary public exhibition of the treasures he has acquired for the reference of fellow fish lovers.</p>
<h3>Zha Ruilong's Physique</h3>
<p>Shadow of the Dancing World</p>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<h3>Whose Sin Is It? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, you reap what you sow. What are the causes of the suicides and lawsuits involving dancers and patrons? I remember once seeing a play called "Tears on Flowers" at the Carlton. The plot roughly described</p>
<p>(12) Mimi, a dancer, was bullied by a wealthy patron and almost committed suicide. The role of Mimi seemed to be played by Lan Lan, and the performance was quite intense. Some female patrons in the audience were shedding tears, perhaps some of them were dancers. At that time, Lu Ming was sitting behind me, gritting his teeth with hatred, while Qin Fang remained calm, and Keng Ran was talking to me about the techniques of screenwriting. I said, "The three of you are watching the same play, but you have three different perspectives." They said, "What about you?" I couldn't answer for a moment. I think the playwright's idea is probably that a group of pot-bellied patrons mostly rely on their stinking money to play with women. Needless to say, this sin is caused by them. It is a pity that the poor students who understand love have no money, and the innocent girls who are driven by food and clothing are forced to become dancers. If they are temporarily deceived by money and vanity, they will inevitably end up in an unfortunate result. The playwright's thinking is not wrong.</p>
<p>However, we must say it again. If we look at it from the principle of freedom and equality, the meaning of freedom is to give full play to one's abilities to achieve one's desires, but the main condition is not to infringe on the freedom of others. Not infringing means not forcing, which means obtaining the consent of the other party. How can we obtain the consent of the other party without coercion? We must stand on an equal footing and exchange equivalent obligations for equivalent rights. In other words, the obligations fulfilled by the patrons are the rights enjoyed by the dancers, and the rights enjoyed by the patrons are also the obligations fulfilled by the dancers. Looking at the general situation, we can say frankly and boldly that it is simply the patrons sacrificing the money earned from their own or their ancestors' blood and sweat, while the dancers are sacrificing their own and their parents' spiritual and physical legacy. We should not judge with one-sided observation. If the patrons do not use the power of money to seduce the dancers, then why should the dancers use the seduction of their appearance to bewilder the patrons? Therefore, when a social evil occurs, we must use a fair perspective to observe both sides and investigate the reasons. As the saying goes, "Grasp both ends and use the middle to illuminate." We can say that this sin is caused by both parties. As for the reasons for causing this sin, one is to only care about oneself and not about the other party, and the other is to not even care about oneself. The former belongs to greed, and the latter belongs to infatuation. Because of greed, they get involved in lawsuits; because of infatuation, they commit suicide. The result of greed and infatuation is anger, and anger will lead to evil consequences.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to advise the general patrons, it is not wrong to spend money for pleasure, as the so-called "transaction and retreat, each gets what they want." Remember not to linger and forget to return, and do not use false words to deceive others (for example, saying that you are not married when you are already married, etc.). Remember not to cause her to have boring consequences. At the same time, I want to advise the general dancers, you must be very careful about having relationships with people. You must understand the psychology of the guests. If you do not have relationships with anyone, compared to having relationships with anyone as long as they have money, I am afraid that the former will be more willing to spend money on you in the long run. Therefore, maintaining your chastity will definitely not affect your income in your profession, just don't let those who spend money put on airs, and don't let those who don't spend money be fools.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The reason for the increase in the status of actors after the Republic of China</p>
<p>In such a grand ceremony, needless to say, tens of thousands of soldiers and officers all wore uniforms and military uniforms. Even the senior generals on the reviewing stand had to wear the ceremonial uniforms of generals, with medals and command knives. Among them, there stood a beautiful, delicate, and weak male actor, Cheng Yanqiu, wearing a long gown and mandarin jacket. Under the gaze of the public, he looked particularly bright like a lotus emerging from water compared to those brave warriors. Mr. Zhang wanted to keep a permanent souvenir, and he also took a photo with him. This matter later spread to Tianjin and Shanghai, and they all said that the long-legged general was too contemptuous of the national law and regarded the military parade as a child's play. On the one hand, they blamed Yanqiu, who was still a child and didn't understand anything, and arbitrarily made trouble with the Zhili-Shandong warlord who came from bandits. In fact, it was precisely because the military and political figures before the Northern Expedition had no regard for national discipline and blindly praised them that the status of the actors was raised. This is very different from the promotion of Sun Juxian by the Ningfang officers mentioned in Item 3. Mr. Sun came from Tianjin at the age of seventy to perform in plays to raise money for the disaster victims in the northern provinces. His character and his intentions are very respectable and worthy of praise. Therefore, there must be a reason to praise people, and there should be a reason to raise the status of actors. Now, people of all levels in society must enjoy equal treatment, and the theatrical arts industry bears the important responsibility of assisting and promoting social education. For example, Zhou Xinfang and others not only deeply understand the responsibilities of artists, but also know the relationship between drama and society and the nation. He certainly values himself, and who in society does not value him in the same way? Therefore, the rise in Mr. Zhou's status seems to be much higher than that of Sun Juxian, who is only charitable. The most ridiculous thing is that there is a generation of people called warlords and politicians who praise them with ulterior motives, so they themselves think that their status has been raised and they can arbitrarily exert their power on others. This kind of thing is enough to show their ignorance. The following is an example of this.</p>
<p>(5) Wu Yulin, Minister of Communications, often reviewed official documents in Shang Xiaoyun's private residence. Shang Xiaoyun, one of the four famous actors, was good at communication and liked to associate with military and political dignitaries. At that time, Utaki Hana, a Japanese reporter from the Shuntian Times, and Wu Yulin, Minister of Communications, were both Xiaoyun's adoptive fathers. Therefore, every time he took the stage, you could always see a Japanese person holding a wine bottle, pouring and drinking it himself, and shouting good in a strange voice. - (4) -</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from May of the 11th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>This year, China has established manufacturing bureaus everywhere to create steamships in imitation of Western methods; now that military affairs are quiet, the steamships require annual maintenance, repairs, and the expenses are enormous, so Li Zhongtang has proposed the establishment of a Merchants Bureau for merchants to transport goods, in order to help with repairs. Zhu Qiong, a waiting magistrate of Zhejiang, has been specially commissioned, and 200,000 taels of silver have been issued to him to purchase land and build a bureau in the 24th Bao area of ​​Pudong, Shanghai, and to start a pilot project.</p>
<h3>Russian Prince Visits China</h3>
<p>The third Russian prince is dignified in demeanor and handsome in appearance, with a particularly magnanimous and bright air. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 14th, he met with local gentry and merchants. On that day, respected Westerners went to visit him in an endless stream. When the Russian prince met with them, he was humble and amiable, making him particularly approachable. In a few days, he will go to the City of Five Rams in Guangzhou to see the scenery, and he also plans to travel to famous places in China; he will go to the capital to see the Upper Kingdom, visit ancient sites, and wants to pay homage to the Emperor to express his admiration.</p>
<h3>Female Waiters in Opium Dens</h3>
<p>In Shanghai opium dens, women are often used as waiters, called female waiters. This newspaper has repeatedly mentioned the drawbacks of this practice. Yesterday, I heard that a man surnamed He was smoking in the Mantingfang opium den and exchanged flirtatious glances with a female waiter. At midnight, he accompanied her to her home; suddenly a man barged in and saw this man, and exclaimed in shock, "Who are you? Why are you in my house late at night!" He stripped off his clothes and chased him away. Yesterday, the man surnamed He filed a complaint in the Mixed Court. During the trial, they debated with each other. Magistrate Zhang ruled: "You are greedy for money and lust, both of you are shameless people. You will be temporarily detained for further questioning." Alas! The harm of female waiters is like this.</p>
