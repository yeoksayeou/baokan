<h3>歐局縱橫捭闔　各某鞏固后方軍事經濟　土軍事代表過法赴英義外長到德　柏林方面又傳出希特勒和議內容</h3>
<p>倫敦　路透社軍事記者稱、如蘇聯果允立即出兵援助德國、則其發動地點殆在羅馬尼亞貝薩拉比亞方面、因是、羅國政府已繼續徵調後備軍、遣往該處邊界、以資防範、紅軍如欲在他處作牽掣行動、則未見其可能、至於蘇聯進攻印度西北邊界及德蘇聯合在西綫抵禦央法聯軍等說、軍事家皆認為不可信、即紅軍乘天空降落侵入法境一說、尤屬妄談、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　羅馬尼亞國外長茄芬哥有應蘇聯政府邀約、前往莫斯科之說、此唇雖經羅國方面否認但英國外交界人士仍頗予以注意、較之義國外交部長齊亞諾柏林之行、允爲重視、均謂德蘇兩國所採取之「和平攻勢」、曾以獲有「各友邦贊助」爲言、所謂友邦、殆指義國而言、但德國不論取獲何國之贊助、其征服波蘭之事、決非英法兩國所能承認、抑此種「攻勢」由英法兩國拒絕之後、義蘇兩國亦未必積極爲德國之助、至以羅馬尼亞國而論、則蘇聯或將加以强大壓力、從不欲收回貝薩拉比亞省（上决歐戰之前屬於俄國、）至少或將要求羅國在政策上追隨蘇聯、此在央法兩國得以何種意見貢獻羅國當局、殊感棘手、特羅國若果依照現行條的、而向英法兩國乞援、則各該國自當履行互助義務、要之、羅國介乎德蘇兩大之間、兩面受有威脅、地位自甚困難、大抵對於蘇聯當出以較為安妥協的態度云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間人士刻在杌隍不寗之空氣中、密切注意德蘇關系、及其在歐洲之影響、但絕不作德蘇衝突必不可免之推測、義國常以巴爾幹和平集團與義國有特殊關係、如蘇聯以播展汎斯拉夫主義爲目的、則義國此種勢力將大受頓挫、目前蘇士談判、亦爲義國人士所注意、依義國人士觀察、貝薩拉比亞不久將爲蘇聯所蠶食、惟匈牙利不致受蘇聯威脅、義大利乃天主敎國、對於蘇聯易起激刺、故波蘭即將蘇維埃化之消息、巳使義國發生深切之印象、除戰爭可使其非洲慾望易於實　外、義國未有開戰之意、現信此種慾望、當可以和平方法　滿之、義國對英法至少亦欲振興貿易、蘇聯西進之影響、亦即爲義國欲與英法結合之一主因、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城德國與羅馬尼亞所進行之經濟談判、頃已宣告結束、按之雙方所商定之新商務協定、兩國進口限額、僅較原定限額略見放寬（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　土耳其沃培將軍所率之軍事代表團、已於今晨抵此、英法高級軍官約在車站迎迓、此行</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社探悉、士耳其沃培將軍所領導之代表團、的下星期中可抵倫教、討論英土經濟財政事件、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　士耳其國外交部長薩拉茹格魯、頃於午後六時、邀約英國駐蘇聯大使西慈爵士、法國代辦巴雅談話、並凝於明日午前返國、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德國經濟代表團、由該國外交部經濟司專員施努爾博士領導、聞當於短時期內前來此間、與蘇聯當局會商關於變方經濟合作之各項細目、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比國京城　頃悉英比兩國代表、定於下星期內、在倫敦進行經濟談判、以謀促進兩國貿易、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>慕尼黑　義國外長齊亞諾今晨八時十八分、抵達慕尼黑總站、義大利駐慕尼黑總領畢塔利到站迎迓、八時三十三分、齊氏專車開往柏林、（一日海通電）</p>
<p>荷屬京城　此間電訊報駐柏林訪員聲稱、據最可靠方面消息、希特勒之「和平提議」、實質上計有兩點、（一）在波蘭組織緩衝國、（二）召集五强會議、解決一切懸案此項提議、將由墨索里尼轉致英法兩政府云、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>西線發生空戰　英德飛機各擊落兩架　薩爾白魯根三面被圍</h3>
<p>巴黎　歐洲戰事至今已達月、此問官方咸預言法軍即將進佔薩爾白魯根、法軍第五十四號公告咋日公佈、謂摩塞爾河東岸之德軍與盧森堡邊境之法軍、昨日相互砲戰甚烈、聯軍與德方飛機亦升起作戰、法官方皆信德軍將於薩爾白魯根與盧森堡間大舉反攻、以圖恢復萊茵區前綫失地、薩爾白魯根之德國人民皆早已撤退、法軍將該城三面包團、德軍必不能久守、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　情報部頃發出消息稱、「英國飛機多架又於昨晚飛往德國北部偵察、幷於事後安然飛返根據地、此外英德兩國飛機昨在德國西綫戰鬬情形、亦有足述者、我國偵察機一小隊會遇敵軍大隊戰鬬機、幷與之作戰、且會擊落敵機兩架、其中一架之被擊落、巳由法軍予以證實、」（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德軍總司令部本日發出文告稱、西發生空軍戰、法國飛機兩架及英國飛機十架與德機鏖戰、在北海之上空、英國飛機兩架被擊落、德方亦損失兩架飛機、總計開戰一月以來、德國空軍及防空隊共擊落法機三十七架、英機二十七架云、（一日海通電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法軍沿摩塞爾河右岸在特里弗期方面進攻之消息、已表示聯軍總司令甘茂林將軍在此區城巳佔先着、該處鐵路至少至特里弗斯爲止、已不復爲德人所能利用矣、法軍所獲之大批德俘、全爲扼守齊格斐陣綫防哨地之兵士、甘茂林將軍肅淸工作之進行、較一般批評家所預料者爲速、法軍在波爾格方面廣五哩半之陣綫上推進其陣地、故其地位更爲堅固、足以應付德方所必有之反攻云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法軍近在摩塞爾河以東推進、故法軍所佔德地爲之大增、軍事行動之一般趨勢、現益形成包圍、而更迫近齊格斐防綫之中央凸角、德軍對於法軍壓力、刻雖有頑强反動、然法軍司令並未一日失其主動地位、法軍向齊格斐綫逐步進取、使人發生法軍按照預定計劃、貫澈其軍事行動、故能進取凖確而絕少傷亡之印象、德國企圖反動時、則遇法軍迅速築成凖備防守之陣地及密集之砲火、結果德軍之反攻、未能延滯法軍之進展、已往二十四小時內、雙方均無大規模軍事行動、法軍刻正鞏固其在阿巴志與貝爾兩處以東新近奪　之陣地、而德軍則派出人數較常時爲少之偵察巡邏隊、軍事評論家今日謂德軍在齊格斐綫之盧森堡一端行動、大受妨害、故德方或即將破壞盧森堡之中立、俾使德軍得有轉動餘地云、瑞士傳來德軍集中黑林之消息、今亦引起一般人注意、因該區有德方通達萊因河之要道也、德軍渡萊因河固甚困難、但不得認爲德軍不能出此、蓋一九一五年間德軍曾冒法軍砲火、在貝爾格勒强渡多瑙河也、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據官方消息、英國偵察機速日飛往德國齊格斐防錢上空活動、業已攝有極詳細之照片甚多、舉凡德國砲隊位置·坦克車壕·暨德軍後方交通網與各種偽裝方法、均已一一入照、此項偵察機攝取敵方地形、飛行甚低、有時低飛至六百尺、敵方高射砲隊多誤認爲德國飛機、竟任其安然飛返根據地、此項照片均已送呈英國遠征軍司令部云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇報重申　和平政策</h3>
<p>莫斯科　消息報本日社論云、「蘇德五不侵犯條的、不問彼竭力挑撥德蘇衝突之某某國之陰謀、終於締結成功、成爲挑戰者煽動全歐大戰之障礙、此必爲全人類所公認、至少頭腦淸明、能正確估計事實之人士、必作如是想、世人當認識此歷史的文件、爲極重要之和平工具、世人必知、苟非蘇聯一貫堅守和平政策、茍無作爲此政策實誰之蘇德條的、全世界當已捲入空前戰禍、其可怖遠過一九一四年至一九一八年之帝國主義大屠殺、現在歐洲發生之帝國主義大戰、已因此而局部化、並縮小範圍、蘇聯領袖絕不容許挑戰者將本國捲入無謂之戰爭、從而已使一憶七千萬人民免於戰禍、歐戰之擴大亦受限制」云、（三十日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>芬蘭要人抨擊　蘇愛條約</h3>
<p>芬蘭京城　芬蘭國會外交委員會主席史文吐昨日對蘇聯愛沙尼亞條的有所批評，謂愛沙尼亞實際上已失去其中立地位且其外交政策亦將受蘇聯牽制於軍事上已成爲蘇聯之同盟國、經濟上則已全向蘇聯屈服、蘇聯已成爲北波羅的海之領袖國矣、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>愛沙尼亞京城　愛沙尼亞海軍總司令梅立、因波蘭潛艇脫逃事、今日免職、尚有高級軍官數員、將交軍法審訊、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　據各方面可靠消息、、德國已許蘇聯在拉脫維亞國自由行動、但蘇聯不致遽以激烈舉動對付拉脫維亞國、一如對付愛沙尼亞國之所爲、第一步辦法聞當提出要求、在該國里巴與汶都兩港口享有特別權利、俾蘇聯在波蘭國所已佔領各地、獲有通海道路云、二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>德方重視　本星期之發展　希特勒尙兾大局轉變</h3>
<p>柏林　據此間政界人士宣稱、德國及全世界本星期內將有最重大事件發生、如德國國會之召集、義大利外長齊亞諾之抵柏林、德國軍隊佔領華沙、以及英相張伯倫法總理達拉第之將發表演說、在在表示本星期將爲國際重大事件週英法兩國之是吾接受德蘇和平提議、抑將繼續作戰、卽在本週內可見分曉云、（一日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒昨日邀請其軸心國伴侶義大利外長至柏林開緊念會議、並定於下星期四召開國會、發表重要宣言、希特勒昨又與各閣員、海陸軍重要人員會晤、談的五十分鐘、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　關於齊亞諾外長柏材之行、各報絕尠加以評論、僅「使者報」登有駐柏林訪員來電稱、「德國元首希特勒現在柏林、自可親自接見齊亞諾外長、該國官方之重視此行、於茲可見、抑外長此行、適在德國宣佈願會同蘇聯政府提出和議之後、於以見歐洲局勢、可在下星期之內有決定的發展」云、此外、各報咸皆相信德國衆議院日內開會時、希特勒元首當發表重要演說、提出和議、自屬意料中事、第其範圍與性質如何、尚難加以臆測耳、（一日哈兀斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　義外長齊亞諾將於今日午後六時到達柏林、訪問時間甚短、至遲於明日晚間即須啟程返羅馬、據此間宣稱、齊亞諾之訪問、爲德蘇協定所造成之新局勢之自然結果、不致產生驚人之發展、德國鑑於時局之變遷、希望與義國要人接觸、以各項新發展通知義國、此項商議、亦爲德義協定之條文所規定之義務云、齊亞諾大的將與德國當局討論墨索里尼爲和平努力之問題、墨氏渴望早日停止戰爭、此間一般人以為齊亞諾之訪問、不應視為驚人之行動、但所以重視此項訪問者、因本星期內歐局將有重要發展也、（一日海通電）</p>
<p>巴黎　義天利國外長齊亞諾柏林之行、頃由此聞各戰加以評論、咸謂德國獲有蘇聯之助、行當採取「和平攻勢」、傳之已非一日、齊亞諾外長此行、亦黨與有關係溫和派秩序報載稱、『希特勒元首之意、「和平攻勢」慾令人望而生畏、除由蘇聯加以贊助外、且當拉攏幾國、以壯聲勢、義國首相墨索里尼前於九月二十三日向波洛阜省法西斯黨黨部領袖發表演說時、雖會表示贊助和平之意、但希特勒元首務欲該國實施其與德國所簽訂之「鋼協定」、而不以空言爲滿足、此齊亞諾外長所由應邀赴德之故也』、右派小日報載稱、「德蘇兩國之和平企圖、必歸失敗、德國與其友邦聯合作持久戰、亦必一敗塗地、此爲希特勒元首所深知、爰擬慫患敎國出而斡旋、但英法兩國必堅決予以拒絕、有可斷言」、右派日報載稱、德義兩國軍事政治協定、（係本年五月二十八日成立、即所謂鋼協定）、曾經規定簽字國雙方遇有必要時、即應交換意見、齊亞諾外長乃有柏林之行、可見局勢之嚴重、無過於此日矣一、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國境內少數民族　共二千九百萬人</h3>
<p>荷蘭京城　德蘇兩國瓜分波蘭領土之後、德國各報對於該國所分得之區域、雖長篇累牘、加以描繪、但對於「大德意志國」境內少數民族數目之多寡、故意略而不談、實則德國在瓜分波蘭之前、其國境以內、巳有捷克人九百萬名、波蘭人一百五十萬名、斯洛伐克人五十萬名、總計的一千一百萬名、佔該國全人口百分之十二、迨至今日、益以波蘭新佔領區城內居民一千八百萬名、少數民族、總數已達二千九百萬名、的等於該國全人口百分之二十八强、自此而後、德國已成爲歐洲方面第二斯拉夫國、（其所擁有之斯拉夫族居民總數、僅亞於蘇聯、）其將成爲蘇聯宜傳之絕好對象、殆無疑義矣、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法軍事當局會議　討論對德戰略　擊破希特勒主義決心　不因德蘇宣言爾動搖</h3>
<p>巴黎　法總理達拉第今日與國防閣員如聯軍總司令廿茂林將軍。海軍總司令述蘭海軍中將。及空軍總司令維爾曼少將等、舉行會議、討論「關係遠大之戰略上問題」、昨隨總統勒白倫視察前綫之東北部陸軍指揮官喬洽將軍亦與會、會議歷半小時、散後遠拉第往見勒白倫總統談三刻鐘（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　最高軍事會議、昨日在此間開會、考慮因蘇德和平宣言所引起之局勢、衆信該會決定蘇德宣言對歐洲局勢並求變更、法國內閣總理達拉第命政府發言人向新聞記者聲稱、法國並未視蘇德和平建議爲善意或能接受者、衆信法國不願任何中立國家爲德國和平居間人、法國政府設法使德國公衆信服、德蘇義三國之威脅不能使聯盟國改變擊破歐洲希特勒主義之旣定政策、「小巴黎人報」主筆彼西撮述法國對蘇德和平宣言反映如下、「此事對希特勒極有榮譽、渠已使波蘭在與圖上消滅、渠撅成為大和平家、與英國簽訂如慕尼黑條的，與法國締結如巴黎條的、以後休息數月、渠將準在歐施行新攻擊、對比利時對法國、誰知渠他日不對義大利攻擊」（一日美聯電）</p>

<h3>『預言和平猶屬過早』</h3>
<p>中日戰爭，終有了局，然了局如何？若任自然推移，得如何了局？爲中國計，應如何了局？爲日本計，應如何了局？近憂如此，遠慮如彼，又將如何了局？凡此問題，入主出奴，各有答案，萬難合一。檢視上海東京兩地報章雜誌，論者旣多；有通病焉。輒先假設一種欲得之結論，然後爲擁護其結論而追求有利於其結論之理由與說明；甚至不恤歪曲事實，顚倒因果；於所忌則中傷之惟恐不及，於所怨則誣蔑之無所不極，例不勝舉，不忍舉。兩國族百年大事，夫豈辯才可濟；况非雄辯。徒見其爲詖辭；或以爲蹊徑在斯，其實增進紛擾有餘，圖謀了局不足，是爲識者所慨歎也。日人船津辰一郎氏日前語英文大美晚報記者云：「中日戰事仍在未可決定之階段，預言兩國問之和平，猶屬過早，蓋無人能言定戰事能持續多久也；」船津氏旅華數十年（報載十三年，記者憶不止此）由津而滬，由仕而商，經歷甚富，交遊甚廣，自一九三一二年之一二八以迄今茲，備受慘痛敎訓，其人乃亦自絢爛趨於平正，今且退休矣；在此日本方面羣以爲有蹊徑可尋之日，發爲了局「猶屬過早」之談，謂非老年人自有其眞知灼見者歟？</p>
<p>了此戰局，或由軍事解決，即交戰國之軍事力量，經長時期之作戰而消長，卒至一方具有絕對勝利之力量；申言之，日本力量能同時控制中國西北西南之全部，而中國抗戰力量完全消失，是爲日本勝；不然，日本侵略力量完全消失，而中國驅日軍於海外，是爲中國勝。此戰爭了局之一方式也。或由政治經濟原因，或中國內變而不復抗戰，或日本內變而不復侵略，或由國際外變而有絕大力量，或壓迫日本，或壓迫中國，或同時壓迫中日。此戰爭了局之又一方式也。第一方式在雙方掙扎之中、我人未欲推論、時閱二載有餘而至今日，雙方是吾各有此軍事解決之自信。第二方式在雙方期待之中，我人姑勿申論「變」之可能孰大而孰利，然期待第二方式之情緒，雙方俱不可掩，而期待對方之變，期待局外之變，皆屬絕無把握之事也。兩國族百年大事，浮沉徬徨於此各無把握之中，夫了局可期耶！</p>
<p>以吾人之觀感所及：中國雖不能把握日本之變，以及國際之變，僅以艱苦徬徨者不無其人；日本旣小能把握中國與國際之變，然徬徨實甚。蓋以戰爭之根本而論：中國爲抵抗侵略，爭取生存而被動抗戰，故在事實上，國族生存條件未得絕對保障之日，絕無絲毫理由，放棄抗戰；若謂保障在中國之虔求，在日本之誠，此或然或不然之主觀論而非必然之客觀事實也。此在日本，侵略必要乎，必效乎，必可持續乎，必不可修正乎。無論在理論，在意願，在事實，至少無一而絕對，無一而必然，甚或無一而然。以戰略之得失而論；日本方面，自始利於速戰速決；及今欲罷不能，猶望速戰速決；彼十年戰百年戰云云，乃無意識之豪語；故其迫切之下文，實爲「若不能速戰速決，則但望能罷即罷」；如何能罷，則有客氣焉，有欲念焉，有虛榮焉，蔽其知慧，於是以歧途爲蹊徑而嘗試之不能自己。此在中國，明知軍備質不如人而所恃在量，故利於所謂「拖」，拖不足爲病，曩日之阿爾巴尼亞，最近之波蘭，病在不能拖，捷克奧地利允病在未嘗拖；能拖，何爲而不拖？以國際環境而論：日本旣以其知慧不能自拔而爲中國所拖，復以其國際地位以及其他種種關係而萬難久於遊移噯昧；中國惟對日抗戰是務，封於國際形形色色之集團陣綫，確是可以置之不問。日本爲應付國際計，旣望所謂「對華事件」能罷即罷，復望挾中國而有利於彼之應付國際；允慮爲中國而使彼應付不了國際。此在中國，在此繼續抗戰時期，儘得以抗戰而優遊於國際，絕不受何拘束；抗戰結束，卓然爲主權完整之獨立自由國家，無論國際如何混亂，亦將在主觀的絕對中立之下，埋頭於生聚敎訓，完成建國復興之偉業；若謂中日戰爭在委屈接受國際某種拘束條件之下，竟得宣告結束，然不由自主，參加國際混亂中之某一集團，某一陣綫，則無論爲目前，或爲遠久之利害計之，甯願拖住日本，繼續抗戰至絕不接受何種拘束條件爲止。質言之：日本與中國敵對之日，喪失其參預世變之資格；假定德蘇義爲一壘，英法美爲一壘，假定日本參加任何一壘有其同量之可能，但必以深入中國泥淖之故，去就皆非；即使參加，病於泥淖，餘力幾何？故以國際環境論、亟需了結中日戰局者乃在日方。若牟利於歐戰之中，中國不作此奢望，日本應有所回憶也。</p>
<p>凡右所陳，日蛤豈必不知；所以自陷於徬徨而不能自拔者，蔽於客氣耳，欲念耳，虛榮耳，猶圖僥倖於蹊徑可循耳。中國方面，如日前外交部長王寵惠氏之談話，坦白率直，無罣無礙；雖惡解之者指爲求和，指爲求美國，要不足以抹煞其所持之和戰界說drim願日本在今日，欲作坦白率直之表示而未能。夫進則戰，退則和，全擊於日本之事實行動，而日本徬徨若此，宜識者觀察，「預言和平，猶屬過早」矣！</p>
<h3>美國增强　遠東艦隊實力　夏威夷將舉行海軍大操</h3>
<p>華盛頓　海軍部對美國各戰艦之行動、皆嚴守秘密、卽被各方皆盼於三之星期中開抵夏威夷參加演習之艦隊之行動、海軍部亦拒不發表、海軍部之命令中、表示此嚴守秘密之原因、乃爲施行「中立巡行」之故、此「中立巡行」雖尚未在西岸施行、但桑地哥與聖彼得羅各重要海軍港、俱已接得命令、夏威夷大演習舉行日期或將不公開宣佈、此大演習中將有戰艦一百餘艘及航空母艦多艘參加、海軍部同時表示、將增加遠束艦隊之潛艇實力、新潛艇開至遠東後、舊艇亦將繼續服務而不撤退、再加十日前抵馬尼刺之航空母艦「郎格雷」號及十四架長程轟炸機、美國亞洲艦隊實力已至爲强勁、（一日美聯電）</p>
<h3>渝方人士觀察　蘇聯仍將助華　蘇日妥協可能絕少</h3>
<p>重慶　羅京所傳蘇日有妥協可能、德蘇日可成立三角同盟之消息、此間認爲又爲一種壓迫英國之方法、此項消息即表示、假若日本能南進而威脅英國之利益、則蘇聯準備與之締盟、此間熟悉時事者皆認蘇聯對於足以摧毀大英帝國之行動、無不願予以援助、德蘇共同宣言、即爲蘇聯此種態度之最近表示、但此間一般人皆認即使蘇日妥協、蘇聯亦不致中止其對於中國之援助、蓋蘇聯向來維持中國之完整者、良以中國若能完整、則蘇聯之西比利亞與海濱省即無問題、因此蘇聯决不致於帮助日本以征服中國、至於英國爲防止日本之南進、而與日本相妥協、則其不利於中國、必較蘇日之妥協爲更甚、據軍事方面稱、蘇日妥協之可能性極少、因此决停戰之前、日軍曾在哈勒欣河方面遭受極大之損失、故關東軍爲維持其榮譽計、不久必將於「滿」蒙邊疆上尋求報復也、（一日美聯電）</p>

<h3>德潛艇戰變本加厲　揚言商船與軍盤作同樣看待　丹麥船四艘英途中被截留</h3>
<p>倫敦　情戰部頃發表公報稱、德國無綫電台日昨廣播消息、謂在過去數日中、該國潛水艇會被英國武裝商船加以襲擊、該國潛水艇一向尊重國際公法、每次襲擊商船之前、無不預先加以警告、但今後爲報復起見、當一變此項態度、而將英國商船與軍艦同樣看待云云、德國此項誣蔑之詞絕無根據、自不待言、英國海軍部爲預防計巳將德國潛水艇作戰方法、行將變本加厲一層、通告全國商船以便加意防範云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於英國海軍大臣邱吉爾昨日在下院發表之談話、謂英國計劃將每一商船武裝起來一節、德國各報今日又復大肆抨擊、「漢堡外報」宜稱、德國已聽見此種恫嚇、且知如何加以應付矣、爲使英國明瞭其可能結果起見、特說明德國對潛艇戰爭之觀念如次、</p>
<p>（一）任何商船不得對於潛水艇按照捕獲權所施予之措施、作何種抵抗、（二）武裝商船幷不自動變爲戰艦或附屬巡洋艦、但如攻擊敵國船隻、則敵國得以其從事戰爭活動而視作戰艦、（三）非法武裝商船之責任、完全在該商船所懸國旗之政府、（四）中立國旅客欲搭乘武裝商船者、其冒險責任、由其本人負之、（一日海通電）</p>
<p>荷京　此間「電聞報」駐丹麥京城訪員頃來電稱、丹麥輪船「羅達」號·「第亞那」號·「瑪爾伽萊特」號·「萊那士」號四艘、載送糧食前往英國、均在途中被德艦扣留、丹麥國人士聞訊之餘、大爲震動、蓋以各該輪船所運之物、均未可目爲違禁品也、此外、挪威貨船「索拉斯號、日前被德艦擊沉之後、船主業於昨日抵達丹麥、據談稱、德國軍艦襲擊該船時、並未在事前發出警告、丹麥當局與人民對於航運安全、因而愈益不安、加之德國政府曾經宣佈各中立國輸船所載戰糧食、苟非運交敵國官廳、即不得視爲違禁品、以上四輸船所載糧食、並非運交英國政府之物、乃由德艦橫加扣留、殊令人難以索解」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　德軍高級指揮部昨日宣稱、德軍對英國之封鎖、亦已以同樣手段對付、在過去四十八小時內、德軍艦已搜查船隻共有四十五艘、內中多艘被押至德國港口、貨物被沒收、關於星期四日英空軍轟擊海立谷蘭德艦事、軍部又發表補充消息、謂曾有德驅逐機二架曾被迫降落海面、機中人員皆經德軍艦救起、（一日美聯電）</p>

<h3>德再駁復　英方摘</h3>
<p>柏林　德國官方曾發表白皮書、闡述導成德波衝突之事件、英人會圖證明其疏誤、本日德國權威方面予以有力之駁復、據稱、德國白皮書巳將王要之文件蒐集無遺、但編集文件具有原則、凡描寫一般氣象之文件、以及談話記錄、則不予列入、英人若以此爲藉口、指摘德國政府意圖隱匿重要之資料、則其採取之方峪、未免失之幼稚、茲將英國蔑辭抨擊之點、擇其尤要者予以駁答、茲舉兩例如左、</p>
<p>（一）英方稱、德國白皮書求申明英國於德國同波蘭提出最後通牒之始、即反對德國有提出最後通牒之權、依照該通牒、波蘭須派使於八月卅日夜十二時到柏林、並須接受德國之建議、德方答、英人稱德國之要求爲最後通牒、已與事實不符、德國政府對於八月卅日之逾限、並未造成何後果、祇於八月卅一日之夜、認爲外交方略業已用盡、英國情報處查閱該國大使之報告（已轉印於藍皮書內）、即知希特勒元首曾以「當然」答復漢德森大使之間題漢氏所問者、波使能吾根據完全平等之原則、進行談判、由此可靚希氏之態度突、至於英國之態度、德國政府至八月三十夜始知英國政府認爲德波兩國於八月三十日成立接觸、乃屬不能實行、</p>
<p>（二）英方又稱、白皮書之著者以及德國政府忽視波蘭有知悉考慮及答復德國建議之權、德方答、根據前條之答復、可知德國建議之程序與波蘭政府之願望、頗可並存不相衝突、進一步言、英國政府尚有於八月卅一日以德國建議之內容通告波蘭之機會、蓋以漢德森大使已於卅夜將德國建議報告倫教、並傳達英國駐華沙大使館、英國之藍皮書固昭示此種事實之存在也、（一日海通電）</p>

<h3>如何穩定戰時糧食</h3>
<p>— 陳禾章</p>
<p>從第一次世界大戰中，得來一個敎訓，糧食在戰時的功效，不低於砲火在前綫的功效；因戰爭期中，須動員數百萬的大軍，糧食的給養不得不力求充足。吾則，戰士挨着餓，豈有力量作持久戰？另一方面，糧食又爲國民最重要的生活必需品，若果民食缺乏，大家受餓，社會就要發生不安現象，因此妨碍軍事上的進行。前次大戰中，德團陸海空軍如何精銳，軍需如何豐實；可是在她背後，國民糧食感到缺乏，到了一九一八年，軍糧也感困難，結果遭到戰敗的厄運！</p>
<p>這次歐戰聞始到現在，爲時未久，各國巳在開始着統制糧食。德國已實行按口授糧，自九月九日起實施麪粉分配制，每人每星期所得麵粉之供給，以五磅爲限。法國政府已將戰時民食接濟條例頒佈施行。英國將發行食粗證八千萬張……凡六歲以下之兒童得享用之食糧，的當成丁額半數（此係十五日海通電；但據九日美聯電載，英政府將於三四星期內，實行統制糧食，英國糧食積存甚多，但鹹肉與牛油因運輸困難或將暫時告乏）。至於義大利，目前暫守中立，但義政府已頒佈戰時經濟緊急條例，關於糧食方面者：禁售酒，咖啡；限制每人每日烘烤麪包一盎斯，每星期兩日無肉食；飯店每餐菜單，限用一肉一魚。可見糧食在戰時的何等重要。</p>
<p>中日戰爭發生後，中國玫府於二十六年八月十八日頒佈戰時糧食管理條例，其中第四條規定管理事項：（一）生產；（二）消費；（三）儲藏；（四）價格；（五）運輸及貿易；（六）統制及分配。自此條例頒佈後，各省市縣均决第成立糧食運銷機關，糧食倉庫在內地及隣近戰區地帶亦先後普遍設立。如最近四川農本局及叫川省銀行等，現正擬大事購買糧食，並設立簡便榖倉，俾農民得以高價抵押其米榖。此舉一方面在使民食可無匱，他方面農民收入增加。</p>
<p>中國糧食生產情形，在戰後尚無統計；但據戰前實業部中央農業實騐所估計自民國二十年至一十四年的產量平均，得出結果：全國二十二省五年平均產稻穀一，〇二六，〇一一，〇〇〇市擔；小麥四四六，三三九，〇〇〇市擔；雜糧一，〇八九，四六二，〇〇〇市擔，共計二，六二九，三六八午市擔。以百分比計算，稻穀佔百分之三十六；小麥佔百分之十七；雜糧佔百分之四十七。再根據各省人口與食糧成數以及每人每年每種食糧之消費數三者加以估計，得出消費量。茲將巳算出供求差額錄下：（一）稻穀—全國生產數爲一，〇二六，〇一一千市擔，實際消費數爲九五九，八七二千市擔，剩餘六六，一三九千市擔。（二）小麥—全國生產數爲四叫六，三三九千市擔，實際消費數爲四六二，四三五千市擔，不尼一六，〇九六千市擔。（三）雜糧—全國生產數爲一，〇八九，叫六二千市擔，實際消費數爲八八七，九一二千市擔，剩餘二〇一，五五〇千市擔。照此統計，食糧總數中尚可餘二六一，五九三千市擔；不過此數所估計實際消費數僅指供人食用而言，家畜飼料種子及其他川途尙不在內。</p>
<p>事實上，中國每年糧食消費的總數實在不少。據實業部中央農業實騐所調查，內地二十二省所產稻穀供人食的佔百分之八十二，供種子的佔百分之八，供畜食的佔百分之四，供其他用的佔百分之六。小麥供人食的佔百分之七十四，供種子用的佔百分之十一，佻畜食的佔百分之五，供其他用的佔百分之十。其他雜糧供人食的佔白分數小，而供畜食及其他用的百分數大。這樣看來，中國糧食生產，供給各方面的消費就不致有剩餘，反而不足。</p>
<p>戰時糧食生產的减退，是普通事實，蓋因爲由於農村中的多數壯丁爲軍隊所徵集與爲軍需工業所吸收，馬匹的徵集，家畜的食用農田變爲戰塲等等，致糧食的生產呈現顯著的减少。就上次大戰觀，交戰各國的播種面積，雖國民很熱心的耕種；可是事實上確是减少。同時在戰時，不能如平時之圓滿得以輸入食糧，亦是普通事實。若是處於封鎖狀態的時候，輸入的困難實是很大。講到中國，主耍食料之米麥在平時以之供人的食用，已綽然有餘；惟加以家畜及其他用途，則感缺乏，此種缺乏，因戰時生產减少，當然要感到更大。所以戰時非力求糧食生產的增加不可，民國二十七年三月三日行政院頒佈難民墾殖實施辦法大綱，確是增加生產的具體辦法。戰後內地各省如川滇湘桂等省，經政府獎勵種植食糧後，稻穀，麥，雜糧的產量已大見增加。今年各地因雨水調順，以及種植方法的改進，糧食又可豐收。所以中國戰時糧食雖感不足；然決不如一般人所想像的那樣嚴重。茍能切實施行統制政策，人民自動節的消費，必要時强制定量分給，凡此各國已不乏先例。對於缺乏較鉅之米麥，除限制不正當的消費外，在消費上儘量以雜糧代用，要知道中國雜糧及牲畜肉類蛋產品等，則患供給過多，平時且有大量輸出。戰時輸出困難，正可調節盈虛。這樣，中國戰時糧食的自給自足，是很可能的事情。</p>
<p>中國親食的不足，其最大原因，在於不正當的消費，允以精製白米及釀酒兩項的消費爲最大。</p>
<p>中國人愛吃精製白米，非但浪費糧食，且於衛生不合戰前上海市社會局工業物品檢騐所用化學分析方法，檢騐糙米白米，得出結果，精製白米所含之蛋白質和脂肪均比較糙米爲少，允以頭號常熟白米爲最少。而上海人最喜食常熟頭號白粳，四十元的頭號白粳，照常有很多人去買。關於糙米輾成精製白米的損失，據實業部中央農業實騐所統計，每石損失二斗四升六合（事實上，輾成的頭號白粳，每石損失需三斗），的等於精製白米消費量的叫分之一。現在假定全年消耗情製白米一萬萬石，其損失的食米照刻石二斗五升計，就有二千五白萬石，已可爲八九百萬人一年的食糧，喏大的損失，實在太不經濟。藥到釀酒的耗損，有人估計國產米麥有百分之五或六供製酒之用，其數量在三千萬石以上；大麥有百分之十五供造酒之用。又有人佔計以穀類製酒，每年消耗約六萬萬石；大小麥之用以造酒之消耗年的一千萬石；高梁產量百分之二十三爲造酒之用。至於製糖飼料尙未有統計，先就巳有靴計之數字看來，可以概見中國糧食的被靡費，簡直驚人。中國政府有鑒及此，曾一再令飭各省地方當局限制主要食糧釀酒。但另一方面還需要全國人民各自訴諸道德的自動節的，儘量食用糙米，以雜糧作爲代用品，力避一切糧食不必需的消耗。</p>
<p>此外，在統制的原則之下，至少要切實的做到防止投機的一點。戰時物價上落太大，往往引起一般的投機行爲；因了這種投機行爲，刺激一種不眞實的供求情形，使物價漲落，更形混亂。要使物價平穩，供求相應，就非防止投機行爲，消滅市塲中不眞實的供求現象不可。所謂投機行爲，不單是指交易所中的投機，諸如個人的儲存糧食，超過本身所需要者，糧食商作超過市塲需要的活動戰，包括在扮機之內。</p>
<p>目前上海，此種投機現象最爲顯著。其他物價姑不論，且看食米一項，漲到這般田地，正是民不聊生！在中國政府鞭長莫及的現在，要使物價平穩，供求相應，不是一件容易的事情。在這時際，惟有盼望租界當局盡其可能，一面遏制物價的繼續上漲；一面竭力設法疏通來源。至於投機份子本身，應覺悟到大衆生活的痛苦，斷不容因他人的述切需要，而握着機會去謀個人的利益，所謂發不道德的「國難財」。在市民本身，要有同舟共濟的精神，相互合作。前次大戰中，法國以戰後麵包及其他糧食品價格漸次上漲，民衆生活日益困難，各地方爲廉價供給麵包及其他糧食品，於是有消費合作社的設立。這是一個可以仿效的先例，市民們不妨以每一里弄作一單位，組織里弄消費合作社，廉價發售生活必需品，關於組織的方法等項，請當局予以指導。同時市民要儘量的自動節的，英國倫敦戰時節的委員會在上次大戰中，會向各酒菜飯分送如下之傳單；「勿浪費麵包，如半片已尼，則將全片切爲牛片吃；爲國民的義務，須互相努力節省麵包。」市民此時，允當三味斯言！</p>
<h3>中國交通建設（續）</h3>
<p>— 湯嘯雲</p>
<p>先以西北各省的公路來說：陝西和新疆等省所完成的公路，已不下數千公里；如自庫倫起經雅馬台，霍達森，沙布克，南北店而入寗夏省，由寗夏冉經威遠更南至廿肅省之酒泉等公路：早己完成。由綏遠經蒙古而達新疆之綏新公路，亦已通車。</p>
<p>至於西南諸省公路建設，較之西北允爲發達。據調查：在西南諸省中業已完成之各公路錢，計有二萬七千餘公里。在積極建樂與計劃中者亦有二萬餘公里。而各省之聯絡幹綫則有：贛滇，川桂，桂閩，湘桂，川湘，川滇，湘鄂，桂滇，川鄂，湘黔，滇黔，和川黔等。此外各省亦均有關於其本省公路之系統的建設計劃。如以貴州省而論：該省現正趕築下列之十餘幹路：（一）川滇路赤威段（近已通車），（二）興仁路（由興仁興義達昆明），（三）安渡路（由安龍經廣西百色達龍州）。以上爲該省與隣省銜接的公路。至於各縣間的公路則有：（四）玉松路，（五）定羅路，（六）都三路，（七）遵平路，（八）遵松路，（九）穗榕路，（十）桐赤路等。</p>
<p>在雲南，本年度所計劃修築的公路有：（一）宣昭段（由宜威經貴州，威寗而達叫川轉達昭通），長的二百九十五公里，宜威至滇黔段已完成，（二）路開段（由路南至開遠）此段叫月即已完威。（三）開剝段（開遠經硯山而達剝隘）全長四百九十公里又一百公尺，由開遠至硯山段早在叫月完成，（四）開節段（開遠至節舊長七十八公里），此段於三月開遠車。此外尙有：（一）峨新段（峨山至新平）長一百八十叫公里。（二）新寗段（新平至寗洱）長三百五十九公里又二百四十公尺，（三）大麗段（大理至麗江）長一百八十公里零六公尺。（四）武元段（武定至元謀）等，均在積極趕築中。賅省各縣間的公路行將完成者有：（一）昆明至富民，（二）祥雲至賓川，（三）賓川至永勝等三綫。在籌劃建築中者尚有：廣富，廣剝，玉溪，河四，通海，江川，華寗等七路。</p>
<p>政府現爲增進公路交通之效率計，已撥款七千六百萬元爲改進費；其中五千二百萬元將用以購買新卡車，一千三百萬元用以改良路面：在政府對公路不惜化費巨款實行建設與改巡之下，今後之公路運輸力，必能日益發展興强大，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>C航空　戰前我國航空綫雖有滬漢，滬平，滬粵，京陝，平漢，京滇等六大幹綫；因其均在沿海及長江各口，以致戰事爆發後即告停頓，其後經政府積極推動與資助下，「中國」，「歐亞」，西南」等三大航空公司，已建設了（一）渝蓉綫，長達二百九十公里；（二）渝昆錢，長七百八十八公里；（三）渝嘉綫，長二百公里；（四）重慶哈密綫，長達二千七百公里；（該綫三月間已正式通航），（五）陜蓉綫，長六百公里；（六）蓉昆綫，長七百公里；（七）廣　綫，長四百零六公里；（八）廣邕綫，全長五百五十一公里。</p>
<p>D電信　政府方面關於水陸空交通積極進行建設外，對於國內之有綫無綫電話電報網之建設，亦不遺餘力。如設立電報總路，擴充固有電綫：增電話綫，建設西南與西北之電話電報聯絡網；並建設無綫電報機通報網，增加國際無綫電報電話直達電路。在各邊省重要都市及昆連各省區，建設小型無綫電台等。如以貴州一省而論，長途雷話已設者達五十二縣；未設置之二十九縣短期縣內設置小型無綫電台，與各縣之長途電話，據估計抗戰一年中，該省電政方面所用銅綫，等於過去二十年所用的銅綫。電信在邊省中突飛猛進，由此可見一般。</p>
<p>結語</p>
<p>因西南西北交通建設廣大發展，不止可使我國的經濟，政治，文化等事業，得以順利的進行建設；軍事方面亦更易迅速集中力量。國際交通綫的擴展，則可突破封鎖而獲得各友邦物質與技術上更多的援助。　（完）</p>

<p>上海日本某某團體於九月二十九日晨、自接日領及日軍司令部接東京方面電告、西尾板垣兩大將到滬日期時間消息後、即會同日本駐滬海軍陸軍憲兵等、分佈於虹口大阪碼頭四週、禁止來往行人、戒備異常嚴密、由該碼頭至日軍司令部、沿途均有日軍密怖、前往碼頭歡迎者、除日領及日海軍陸軍憲兵代表外、並有偽「市長」傳筱庵·偽警局長盧英、及某派易贊仁·陳農夫·暨福益會·大民會·等代表、</p>
<p>中日各綫　即將大戰</p>
<p>關於西尾板垣抵滬後、上海日本各報紙對於此項消息、均守秘未予透露、意在愼防華方注意、而作軍事上更堅强之抗戰準備、此尤值得華人之重視、繼據非正式方面消息、西尾板垣抵滬後、連日正與在滬日官員密會晤談、一俟有重要決定、即行遄赴前方各綫視察、並即將督師對華軍展開大戰、藉作最後之掙扎、按大戰原因、以華方對日和平無望、仍抱抗戰到底之信念、</p>
<p>西尾離滬　飛往南京</p>
<p>字林報云、新任在華日軍總司令西尾將軍及其參謀長即日本前陸相板垣、均於星期五日下午先後抵滬、在市中心區留宿一宵、昨（三十日）午十二時三十分離滬飛往南京、</p>
<h3>柳川發表談話　勸誘經濟合作　謂日本不欲操經濟覇權　但華人絕無合作之意嚮</h3>
<p>字林報云、日本興亞院總務長官柳川中將，頃在該院華中聯絡處招待新聞記者、聲稱、日本不致拒絕第三國人民參加日方之在華企業、華人參加日方企業者、亦所歡迎、日軍侵佔區內若干華人資本家、今仍不欲與日人合作、對於日人謀取</p>
<p>此種合作</p>
<p>而與之商議者、亦加拒絕、然侵佔區內之和平與秩序、旣在迅速恢復中、若輩應爲中國人民之福利計、而對各種事業之復興、相助一臂之力、若干方面之見解、認中日經濟合作、爲日本欲操</p>
<p>經濟覇權</p>
<p>然日本非但绝無此種意嚮、且頗歡迎華方資金返日方侵占區、日本亦不致拒絕第三國人民參加日方之企業、設立在華日軍總司令部與汪精衛成立新中央政府事、對於興亞院之</p>
<p>已定計劃</p>
<p>不致有影響云、按柳川中將定今日九時乘輪離滬赴廈門、據日文上海每日新聞載稱、柳川在滬會訪日本駐華艦隊總司令及川海軍中將等、並派代表訪上海特別市府首腦與日防軍軍官、</p>
<h3>日海運會社雖成立　並無意義　企圖操縱東亞航運　日公司均虛與委蛇</h3>
<p>日政府乘歐戰機會、企圖完成操縱所謂「東亞」海面之全部航運起見、以重大壓力加諸日商各大輸船公司後、產生之「東亞海運株式會社」、巳於昨日在廣東路二十號前日商日淸公司原址、宣告正式成立、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>合併經過</p>
<p>日本東京政府於上月一日即以實行合併之命令、改建日商各大輪船公司、當時接此命令者、計有日本郵船公司·日淸公司·大阪公司·山下公司·大連公司·等五家、日淸首先表示從命、嗣後大阪公司亦繼日淸之後加入、惟日郵公司因爲世界班輸、山下公司均係野鷄班輪、大連公司藉口專駛華北大連錢、故遲遲未允合作、中間迭經日政府與各該公司接洽多時、日郵公司始允將中日間之航船數艘、局部割讓參加、世界班輸仍保持日郵名義、且屬獨立性質、山下公司則完全接受、僅大連公司暫不加入、故所謂「東亞株式會社」爲綜合日淸·大阪·山下·三公司及日郵之一部、合併組織而成、</p>
<p>航綫船隻</p>
<p>據查各該公司參加東亞會社之航綫及船隻、日郵公司係將長崎上海間之客輸長崎丸·上海丸·兩客輪及妙見丸·妙義丸·妙清丸·三貨輪、共計參加五艘、日淸公司則以全部長江班綫大吉丸·瓜陽丸·安興丸（前報商輪船）·等約二十艘、大阪公司則以中日綫之福建丸、長沙丸·及華南班輸數艘加入、山下公司則盡屬野鷄班輸、數達十艘、但其航綫還及南洋羣島、故日政府計劃操縱之東亞海運綫、包括中日綫·華南綫·長江紅·甫洋綫·等四路、華北綫尚未參加成功、且據一般觀察、雖其雄心勃勃、但以船隻缺乏、難達預期目的、至操縱東亞株式會社大權者、仍爲日淸公司總辦卡吐殺（譯音）氏、</p>
<h3>蘇州河北　居民不勝苛擾　戶口調查定十一日開始　强迫注射以居住為要挾</h3>
<p>蘇州河北甲區、日方自强迫當地居民注射防疫針以來、原定上月底截止、卒以拒不前往注射者尚衆、故日方不得不將注射期展延、茲分述各情如次、</p>
<p>拒不注射　宣告延期</p>
<p>日方在北江西路海寗路上海電力公司側面所設篷帳注射處、係假「闡北履仁醫院巡廻班第三組」名義、昨日該「翳院」復貼有通告、宜佈是項注射期限、展期一旬、至十月十日截止、故昨晨起、該篷帳下仍在繼續施行强迫注射工作、秩序方面、改由匯司捕房派中西捕維持後、已完全改觀、以前凌亂景象、爲之一掃、</p>
<p>通告詞句　極盡威脅</p>
<p>據該區域某居民向大通社記者談、日方對該區域調查戶口期限、亦展於本月十一日開始、屆時須索閱防疫證明書、然後再換通行證、始聽其在區內居住、又查所謂「履仁醫院」出貼通告內、亦有如不依期注射防疫針、絕對禁止在北河南路海寗路一帶通行之嚴重語句</p>
<p>居民不安　遷徙絡繹</p>
<p>觀乎上項情形、日方將對該區域內居民以種種不便限制、迨巳情見乎詞、惟其限制地段祇爲北河南路海寗路一帶、抑包括北河南路東邊其他橫路、則並無顯著之表示、誠屬費解、以故該區域內居民、顯已引起相常不安、向北河南路以四或蘇州河以南遷徙者、頗不乏人、而該區域內各里弄間召租房屋之招貼、尤極繽紛之致、</p>
<p>甲區各段　防務情形</p>
<p>該區域易防以後、日方在北江西路海寗路南口、仍放有步哨、至北江西路海寗路及文監師路兩封鎖缺口處、崗位上各站有日兵兩名、通過缺口、均須出示通行證、北河南路一帶、則概由英軍駐防、匯司捕房警務人員、亦照常巡邏、</p>
<p>市商會內　蕪穢不堪</p>
<p>天后宮橋北堍上海市商會內、自被「大道市府」佔據以來、其甬道及庭院、已蕪穢不堪、所謂「大道警察」、係駐紥於廡廊下一帶披屋中、總數佔一小隊、均已解除武裝、門口及「發通行證」處守衛之徒手警察、即係若輩同夥、並非最近自外所調來、</p>
<h3>偽府接收法院　謠諑復熾　領團態度如昔　堅決拒絕要求</h3>
<p>大陸報云、南京偽「維新政府」不久將接收上海華方法院之謠諑、昨（三十日）夜復熾、日方授意之消息謂、據「消息靈通方面」聲稱、該兩法院將由近被國民政府免職之前任某首席推事充首腦、除首席推事外、偽政權官員業巳抉選「合格」人選、以充各種職務、「司法部」分總部已在虹口設立、負接管法院之資云、按關於特區法院事、偽政府已向此間領事團迭提要求、惟均遭拒絕、去春盛傳偽「市府」將用武力、接管法院之謠涿時、駐滬英防軍即加派武裝衛兵、駐守法院所有屋字、</p>
<h3>德平購票旅客　無法登輪</h3>
<p>滬甬綫航輸、自縮短航程計劃不果實行、謀福輸即中止抽暇返滬、因之旅客均紛紛改購德平輸船票、該輪原定二十九日開鎭、嗣以裝貨需時、改於三十日下午四時啟椗、詎當開駛時、發覺有一部份未購客票旅客、擅行登輪、堅欲搭載前往、而已購票旅客數百人、反而因擁擠異常而無法上船、雖經輪方派昌向無票登輪旅客極力勸導、卒告無效、故該輪已於昨晨開出、惟購票旅客被摒在岸者頗衆、情形愁苦、</p>
<h3>善團給養　數額限制</h3>
<p>上海難民救濟協會供應各善團給養、近以物價高漲、開支益見浩大、除繼續勸慕以資維持外、並限制各善團給養人數最高額如下、（一）慈聯總曾一七九三〇人、（二）中國救濟婦孺總會六二九人、（三）慈聯分會八六六一人、（四）國際救濟會三七七三人、（五）五縣同鄕會三一〇人、（六）至聖善院一五〇人、（七）寶山同鄉會一一二人、（八）市民聯合會九五人、（九）中華慈幼協會四一八人、（十）中華麻瘋救濟會三一人、（十）（一）難童中學一七〇人、其餘難民產科醫院及第一第二兩收容所、暫不限制、</p>
<h3>內地嚴防法幣出口　運滬套買外匯　頒布法令禁止挾帶　檢查飛機帶運物品</h3>
<p>財政部爲防止法幣有不必要流出起見、除嚴厲限制自內地向外滙款外、並頒佈法令、禁止法幣出口、旨在防止私運法幣出境、向上海香港越南等地購買外滙、今特規定辦法、電各省切實嚴密檢查取締、（一）無論任何公私機關、由商用飛機帶運一切物品出境、必須先得軍事委員會批准給證、方准放行、並由檢查機關負責檢查、（二）飛機旅客之隨帶行李、汽車旅客之行李貨物包件、除友邦外交人員、須依照國際上向例辦理外、其餘一律受檢查機關之檢查、（三）各航空公司汽車運輸機關、及其他人員携帶之物品、均應依照上述辦理、（四）飛機汽車姑之出入口過道、由檢查機關嚴密設計、杜絕繞越傳遞等弊、（五）現行限制携帶鈔票及物品運輸之各項法令、與本辦法不相抵觸者、仍通用之、</p>

<h3>秋收後上海米價　視運輸為轉移　倘運輸暢便即可回跌　市上頂好累米仍缺貨</h3>
<p>上海公共租界及法租界之民食、自經各團體向西貢訂購洋米運滬平糶、以及竭力設法疏通國米來源後、嚴重之恐慌問題始告解決、至於市塲米價、際此晚稻登塲之時、依然不能下降、其主因爲來源囤積等問題、聞各米業團體爲維持民食起見、已勸導各販商疏通國米來源、俾滬市米價得以回降、</p>
<p>取締囤積　并不懈怠</p>
<p>同時租界當局對於界內存米、隨時派員密查、嚴格執行取締國積、故今後之上海米價、因晚稻將完全登塲、倘運輸暢便、不久可望回跌、近來市上新秈尚充足、惟頂好國米仍缺貨、零售須四十餘元、但居民購者不及百份之一、故影響民食尚輕、</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>衣食住行等的始祖</h3>
<p>— 競爭</p>
<p>衣食住行的各方面，據說是各有始祖的。當然，這並不是說這始祖就是「發明者」，但至少也代表了各業起源的時代吧？</p>
<p>先說衣食住行方面的：成衣業始祖是軒轅黃帝，庖廚業是灶君，酒業是杜康，煤窰盆碗缸業是老君，染業是梅葛仙，針業是劉海，篦業是綠仙女，皮業是「白頭兒佛」，秤業是胡鼎眞人，燒窰業是郭公，丸藥業是神農，鐵業是氈採老祖，僕役業是鍾三郎，旅業是關羽，木業是楊四將軍，建築業是張班魯班，茶業是陸羽，鞋業是孫贖，木石瓦等業是公輸子。</p>
<p>文事方面的：筆業始祖是蒙恬，紙業是蔡倫，書業印刷業是文昌公，丹靑業是吳道子，刻字業是王維，書法業是蕭何曹參，硯業是子路。</p>
<p>其他的一切：妓女業始祖是管仲，戲業是唐明皇，相面業是麻衣仙，剃頭業是羅祖，玉石業是白衣神，銀業是歐岐佛，紮彩業是五道子，錢業是玄壇，說書業是崔仲達，柳敬亭。一般的傳說如此，姑妄聽之，聊作談助罷了。</p>
<h3>童裝剪料設計</h3>
<p>— 分文</p>
<p>我們爲便於計算起見，假定衣料的門面是二尺，需製的件數是一件，服裝的種類，也暫時區分爲長袍，短衫，和褲子三種。</p>
<p>先講長袍，六歲至八歲的兒童，身長大的要二尺左右，腰身五寸，應剪衣料五尺六寸。如果是夾袍的話，須加剪夾裹五尺。九歲至十歲者，平均身長二尺五寸，腰身五寸一分，應剪衣料六尺五寸，夾袍則加剪夾裹六尺二寸。十一歲至十二歲，身長三尺，腰身五寸三分，應剪衣料七尺五寸，夾袍須加剪夾裹七尺。十三歲至十五歲，身長三尺叫寸，腰身六寸，應剪衣料九尺，夾袍加剪夾裹八尺五寸。</p>
<p>再講短衫，六歲至八歲的，長的一尺三寸，腰身五寸，應剪衣料二尺六寸，夾襖應加剪夾裹二尺四寸，丸歲至十歲，長一尺叫寸，腰身五寸一分，應剪衣料三尺，夾襖須加剪夾裹二尺七寸。十一歲至十二歲，長一尺五寸，腰身五寸三分，應剪衣料三尺二寸。夾襖須加剪夾裹二尺九寸。十三歲至十五歲，長一尺五寸，腰身六寸，應剪衣料叫尺，爽襖須加剪夾裹三尺五寸。</p>
<p>至於褲子，六歲至八歲者長的一尺六寸，應剪衣料三尺二寸，夾襖須加剪夾裹三尺。九歲至十歲，長一尺八寸，應剪衣料三尺六寸，夾褲加剪夾裹三尺四寸。十一歲至十一歲，長二尺，應剪衣料叫尺，夾褲加剪夾裹三尺九寸。十三歲至十五歲，長二尺二寸，應剪衣料四尺四寸，夾褲則加剪夾裹四尺二寸。</p>
<p>這僅僅是一個簡略而普遍的設計。身材不同時身長每增添一分，可添剪衣料二分，再多則依此可以類推，聰明的主婦們，一定會照這個原則自己去伸縮，不必再假手於裁縫或別人了。</p>
<h3>住宅的剿匪者—猫</h3>
<p>— 燿庭</p>
<p>家庭裏有了貓，就可使老鼠絕跡·所以，貓不愧爲住宅的剿匪者·關於貓的形態，性情，人人所習知，無用贅言·惟獨大家所忽略的，就是貓的養育問題；尤其是小貓，最容易牛途而死·人家往往說是「老鼠作祟」，或者「養牲無福」·這種迷信觀念，不足爲憑·本人實際研究，覺得這問題不外下面幾點道理：</p>
<p>第一，貓是食肉動物，肚腸特別細長，很複雜的盤旋在腹內·小孩們往往喜歡捉貓，在它腹部用力一擰，就容易使肚腸粘合或受傷·因而大便失常，消化不良而致死·第二，小貓不知飽餓，隨着慾望而吃東西·人家往往把食盆放在檯上，任它隨時去吃，這對於大貓也不適宜；若用以待小貓，更是絕大的錯誤·第三，小貓的食料中，應當放些食鹽·人家往往是淸燉小魚，把食鹽忽略·久而久之，小貓就因爲缺乏鹽份而生病·第四，小貓身上多蚤，這是它的心腹大患·最好常常替它洗濯·不然，就把樟腦丸的粉末散布在它身上，跳蚤就能絕跡·第五，應該預備些鋪有軟褥的地方，使小貓住宿因爲它若沒有好的陲處，往往寄宿灶脚裹，受穢物的侵襲；毛也因而損傷·漸漸的蹧蹋下去，以致生病死亡。</p>
<p>上面五條，是人家最不注意，而是最要緊的事實·假使能够切實的研究，再加以改良·那麼，小貓就不難養育成一隻可愛的，健康的，住宅的剿匪者了·</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期說起蟹粉豆腐羹之美，本星期索性再來說說豆腐。近來吾家常吃靑菜豆腐湯，幾乎三頭兩日都耍吃一下，這兩樣東西都富於維他命，凡是有病的人，西醫們往往勸他們多吃靑菜湯，其有益於身體可知，現在更加入豆腐，不是雙料有益了嗎？靑菜以雞毛菜爲最好，要是覺得單用雞毛菜和豆腐做湯太單調，那麼儘可加些別的東西在內；像我們手頭恰好有一塊火腿，就切些火腿絲，和邊尖香菌一同加人，自然更覺鮮美可口了。如果沒有火腿，就是猪肉絲牛肉片也同樣可用，大家何妨試一試呢。此外葷的如小白蝦燒豆腐，鹹鮝魚煎豆腐，雞鴨血豆腐湯；素的如絲瓜燒豆腐，雪菜燒豆腐，蓬蒿菜燒豆腐等，也是下飯的妙品。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>洋蔥牛肉絲　白蝦焼豆腐　油條炒莧菜　煎臭豆腐乾</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>白肉蘿蔔湯　糖醋小鲫魚　清炒金花菜　葱花豆瓣沙</p>

<h3>學生經濟宿舍中的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 君木</p>
<p>福州路河南路口五洲大樓七，八，九，三層的學生經濟宿舍，是由全國學生救濟委員會委託青年會辦的。該會撥款八千餘元，並由青年會捐助二千餘元，經費共萬餘元。入內寄宿者不論性別及宗敎，以現在正式肄業者為合格，欲寄宿者須先央保證人（須住居本埠有正當職業者）填具保證書，學校校長填具身份證明書，並自已眞寫詳細履歷家庭經齊狀况表，然後携同向宿舍當局聲請登記，遇有空位，經談話認爲合格後再行函傳。共備楊位九十七，但是登記的人很多，每次恒數百人。宿舍有管理員三人，內主任一人，此外男女管理員各一人，常川駐宿舍，管理一切事宜。以上所述乃學生經濟宿舍中大概情形。現在要講到衣食住行的本題來了。不過我並不依着衣食住行的次序來講，憑我個人主觀眼光，以其重要與吾而先後分述之。</p>
<p>關於住，因寄宿者均係學生（其中且以大學生居多，的占全額五分之三强），故一切均營圑體生活，雖和戰前的學校生活不能相比，但在此畢樣環境下之孤島，已屬最近理想的了。學生來滬求學，所最感動困苦者，厥為居住問題，這大概就是經濟宿舍舉辦的緣起罷。宿舍凡三層，七層樓有管理員辦公室一間，會客室一間，學生臥室西間，女管理員臥室一間，此係女生部。八樓及九係男生部，八樓有學生臥室三間，男管理員臥室一間，九樓有臥室一間，此外閱覽室一間亦闢於九樓。寄宿者每月宿費五元，僕雜費一元，每三月繳費一次。初次入內寄宿者，且須繳保證金五元，（現因水電等各物漲價，自十月一日起，每月暫增收特別雜費一元）。由宿舍當局每人供給帆布床及小書桌各一，臥室中舖位頗擠，恒二床合併在一起，故僅備睡臥而已。讀書則須至九樓之閱覽室中，惟閱覧室亦頗小，至多可容三十五人在內「開鑛」。室中置有申報，中美日報（現停刊），新聞報，大陸報（英文）四種報紙，此外備有各種圖書雜誌，專供學生閱賣。室中一壁上懸有世界地圖及中華大地圖各一，其中則縣國旗一面，此在孤島上不可多得者也。宿舍每層均有浴室之設備，每逢星期一，三，五，日，四天下午供給熱水（本每日上下午均有熱水，現因外匯暴縮，各物昂貴之故），冷水則終日供給。寄宿學生有學生誼會之組織，每月開大會一决，由大會產生執行委員會，領導一切學生運動。分設有學術，歌詠，體育，遊藝……等股，故學生生活動頗有生氣。學術股每半月有壁報出版，學術歌詠二股且曾於暑假中舉辦國語歌詠二講座，現已結束，成續頗爲圓滿，於舉行結束大會時，國語組有話劇之表演，歌詠組則演唱各種新歌，體育股於每日清晨舉辦早操。宿舍中現雇用茶役二人，Boy一人，為學生掃除臥室，冲開水及雜差之用。</p>
<p>關於食，恐怕走盡上海租界沒有比這宿舍裹的更便宜了。（當然特別情形者例外，）現每月全膳者膳費十元七角五分，牛膳（一决早膳此外午膳或晚膳）六元三角五分，用膳地方即將”覽室暫改勝廳之用。此外由學生自己組織消費合作社，除發售實用必需品外，置有乾點心人糖果等食物，供學生暫時充饑之用。</p>
<p>關於衣，寄宿者，以淸寒者多，故學生衣服均極樸素，絕少浮華，因爲衣，連帶想到了洗衣的問題，學生外面的衣服，有洗衣作每星期來二决，短褲及汗背心則均自己洗濯，宿舍當局且備有矚衣竹，以供應用，女生部且有曬衣架之設備，蓋女生外面之長衣亦每多自洗也。</p>
<p>關於行，所要論述者，並非寄宿學生各人在外之行，乃進入五洲大樓後之行，電梯可乘至六樓，然後須拾級上登。用勝時，七八樓的學生均須按步上登至九樓暫時膳廳，此以寄宿於九樓者最爲便利，惟平常則以居九摟者最費力也。每樓均有寬大平台，可資早操及散步之用。</p>
<p>以上所述乃學生經濟宿舍中衣食住行情形之大要也，足供欲往寄宿的學生之參考。</p>

<h3>分幣券發行第一天</h3>
<p>民眾歡迎紛紛向烟兌店兌換　一角兌八分烟兌店奇貨可居</p>
<p>是一個秋光明媚的淸早，實報童的嘴里，都喊着：「要看今朝中央銀行發行分幣券……一分紅……五分綠……」因爲要曉得如何手續可以掉到分幣券，因此賣報的生意，亦較他日平添了幾倍。</p>
<p>在敏體尼蔭路的北首，某烟紙店的櫃榨闌杆上，掛了一塊紙板的招牌，在紅紙上寫着：「本店兌換分及五分分幣券」，過路行人的視綫，都集中在這片招牌上，雖祇有這麼幾個藍字，而牠的魔力，眞不可思議！</p>
<p>「掉分幣券！」一個年輕的小夥子，踏上街沿，把一元的一張中國銀行的鈔票，放到櫃檯上。</p>
<p>「一元不掉，每人最多掉換二角！」店里的夥計嘴里这麼的回答，手里却在包着油氽果肉。</p>
<p>「幹嗎？一元不掉，祇能兌二角！」那小夥子再提問着。</p>
<p>「先生，實在對不起！我們店里一共祇換到五十元，假使每人兌一元，祇能應酬五十位顧客。因爲今天是第一天發行分幣券，大家都想一些，即使每人祇可掉換二角，恐怕也不到二小時，那五十元分幣券，一定被掉一空。好得明後天可繼續掉換，你先兌了二角再說吧！」店里的夥計很和靄地申說着理由。從賬臺的一隻小鐵匣里拿出二張五分和八張一分的分幣券，八張一角的角票，一同放到櫃檯上。把那小夥子的一張一元的鈔票，二面都看了一眼，再放到賬臺的抽屜裹。</p>
<p>「怎麼？二角祇兌一角八分？」那小夥子驚奇的問着。</p>
<p>「二角掉九張，還不便宜？比那污損的郵票，假的代價券，要合算得多哩！况且你自己去掉，旣費車資，又須辰光，現在一角掉九分，我們無非亦出產一些車資吧了！」夥計又細細的辯駁着。</p>
<p>那小夥子把一疊嶄新的分幣券，在櫃檯上點了一遍，排排整齊，納入了衣袋里，離開了烟紙店。</p>
<p>連一接二的兌分幣券者，竟絡繹不絕。因爲一樣東西盼望了好久，一旦得到手中，折扣雖然大些，亦都肯樂於接受的。</p>
<p>不到半小時的兌換，店中的分幣券已兌去了一大半。因此兌換的貼水，亦同時增加到百分之二十，「一角角票，祇兌換分幣券八分」，但是持角票前往掉換者，仍連續不斷。內中有一部份持角票去掉換分幣劵者，却是一般十一二歲的小孩子，他們都被好奇心的驅使，以為難先掉到分幣券，拿在手里，在學校里的同學跟前，是最榮耀不過的一件事。</p>
<p>一張一張的分幣券在减少的時候，一方面那盈餘亦同時在一份一份的增加。到剩最後一部份分幣券的時候，那招牌已被夥計除去了。此時，必須臃買一些姻紙雜貨，同時可附帶掉換一角分幣券，吾則，單單掉換分幣券，竟遭到他們底白眼！</p>
<p>僅僅一小時的兌換，那姻紙店里的老闆，已平空地撈到了一筆意外的收穫。（星）</p>
<h3>穩固中國的幣制</h3>
<p>— 星火</p>
<p>人們噹遍了難色代價券的苦痛，對新分幣劵的發行，眞是期待得快要流出眼淚來啦！難怪新分幣券開始兌換的消息傳出，全市都有點似痴似在，在電車上，在商店前，誰不在那裹問新分幣券呢。當伙計回答說「沒有」！就會無形的感到懊喪，失望。相反，要是獲得了分幣券，一種不可壓制的喜悅便會從眉宇之間流露出來；像是得到了珍寶一般，獻給朋友看，並且自傲的誇耀說：「喏！這個東西，你有沒有？」雖然價值祗有一分或是五分，但在沒有見到過的人，必會放出奇異的眼光，槍過來看，同時給予一種高價的批評。「究竟政府裹印的票子神氣！」可是，看儘管看，要揩油，就別想。不要說揩油，就是把一張簇新的平平整整的分幣券摺壞了一隻角，也會呌人老大不高興的</p>
<p>爲什麼那樣熱烈地歡迎着分幣券呢？等得長久了，固然是一個原因。但是人們的「迎新」心理和市面上流通的稀少，也就抬高了身價。說起市面上流通數目不多，一方是因爲中行採取逐漸發行制度，一方面却是爲了姻兌業的居奇。市面上越是少，人們的要求也就越厲害。而乘機漁利，自然沒有問題了。筆者就是以一角換得九分分幣券的一個。這差不多巳成爲一貫的現象，以前一角二角的鎳幣和一分銅幣發行時，也是抬高價格的。這現象的形成，一半還是現在發行的辦法欠妥當。單呌錢兌業去發行，不啻是使錢兌業有營利的機會。而錢兌業的分發不平衡，又可以在錢兌業公會前爭執毆傷七人這一事件看得出來的。所以，要杜絕雜色代價券，非使新分幣普遍流入民間不可；要普遍，照現在這辦法是做大不到的。中行的採取逐漸發行制，用意當不外乎避免擠兌，但限定一個數目（十元，五十元，或一百元），事實上也不會怎樣擁擠的，而流通市面也一定較速。</p>
<p>問題又得歸納到「商業道德」上面去的。如果顧到道德關被强迫使用「華興券」之後，一般商人已在偷偷地做着「華興券」的買賣。這種現象的產生，歸根結底還是在於缺乏「商業道德」。雖然「天高皇帝遠」，國法不能應付孤島的特殊舉動，但，如果不以「亡國奴」自居，國家的法令還得要遵守的。所以財部通告不許買賣「華興券」固然耍嚴厲執行，而中行通告十足兌現分幣券，也不得陽奉陰逹的。</p>
<p>穩固中國的幣制，是我們每一個人的責任。</p>
<h3>二房東繁華東夢的幻滅</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>自從上海的租界上面，發生了擠居情形之後，房屋求過於供，頓感不足。房租雖高到嚇人，想租房子却不容易，速召租紙都不大看見。這和「八一三」之前，每一條衖堂口，紅色的豆腐乾形召租紙貼成厚厚的一疊成了反比例。</p>
<p>然而上海的畸形榮終究不能持久了，黃金時代在一瞬間過去，爲了米價的高貴，百物的昂漲，大部分人困在「孤島」不能維持生活，第此以往，無非坐而待斃，所以就開始離上海，不是到內地，就是回到鄉下去。</p>
<p>這種情形，由於召租紙的重現，便可獲得充分的證明。這幾天，我們走到外面，衖堂口，電桿木上，又到處可看見貼着召租紙條兒。拿數字說，雖然沒有「八一三」之前的多，但比幾個月前是多得不少了。</p>
<p>據非正式的統計，最近上海的住民，爲生活程度的奇高，回鄉或是到內地去的，平均每天有三四百家。沒有職業的，在「孤島」避難而帶出來的錢已用完的，祇有下鄉去；連得有職業的，要是薪給過分少，也都把家眷還回內地。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，空屋自然會一天天的多起來，加着最近新造的房子，又到處可以看見。所以擠居問題早已過去，而我房子也沒有幾個月前的難了。不過一般的二房東，還在做著繁華的夢，房租非但不便宜，連舊房客也要加租呢！</p>
<p>不過事實上，人一天天的走散，此後上海的空屋或許將更多，到今年年底，我們相信又會有不少召租紙貼在每一條衖口，看一般二房東的繁華夢，能夠永久做得下去嗎？</p>

        <h1>1939.10.02</h1>
<h3>European Situation: Intricate Maneuvering; Various Countries Seek to Consolidate Rear Guard, Military, and Economic Positions; Turkish Military Delegate Passes Through France En Route to England; Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Germany; Berlin Reports Hitler's Peace Terms</h3>
<p>London (Reuters Military Correspondent): If the Soviet Union agrees to immediately dispatch troops to aid Germany, the point of attack would most likely be in the Bessarabia region of Romania. Therefore, the Romanian government has continued to mobilize reserve forces and send them to the border there for defense. It is unlikely that the Red Army would take distracting actions elsewhere. Military experts consider claims of Soviet attacks on India's Northwest Frontier and a joint German-Soviet defense against Allied forces on the Western Front incredible, especially the notion of the Red Army invading France by parachute. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: There are rumors that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has accepted an invitation from the Soviet government to visit Moscow. Although this has been denied by Romanian sources, British diplomatic circles are paying close attention to it, considering it more important than Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's trip to Berlin. It is widely believed that the "peace offensive" undertaken by Germany and the Soviet Union claims to have the "support of friendly nations," likely referring to Italy. However, regardless of which nations Germany secures support from, the Anglo-French nations would certainly not condone Germany’s conquest of Poland. After the rejection of this "offensive" by England and France, Italy and the Soviet Union may not actively assist Germany. As for Romania, the Soviet Union may exert strong pressure on it to either reclaim Bessarabia Province (formerly part of Russia before the start of the European War) or at least demand that Romania follow Soviet policy. It is difficult to determine what advice England and France can offer to the Romanian authorities. If Romania requests assistance from England and France in accordance with existing treaties, those countries would be obligated to fulfill their mutual assistance commitments. In essence, Romania is situated between Germany and the Soviet Union and is threatened from both sides, placing it in a very difficult position. Generally, it should adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet Union. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: People here are closely monitoring German-Soviet relations and their impact on Europe amid an atmosphere of uncertainty, but they do not speculate that a German-Soviet conflict is inevitable. Italy has a special relationship with the Balkan Entente. If the Soviet Union aims to spread Pan-Slavism, Italy's influence in the region would be greatly diminished. Current Soviet-Turkish negotiations are also being watched closely by people in Italy. According to Italian observers, Bessarabia will soon be annexed by the Soviet Union. However, Hungary is unlikely to be threatened by the Soviet Union. As a Catholic nation, Italy is easily provoked by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the news that Poland is about to be Sovietized has deeply impressed Italy. Italy has no intention of starting a war, except for the opportunity that war presents to easily realize its aspirations in Africa. It is believed that these aspirations can be achieved peacefully. Italy wants to revitalize trade with England and France, at the very least. The influence of Soviet westward expansion is also a major reason for Italy's desire to unite with England and France. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania: The economic negotiations between Germany and Romania have recently concluded. According to the new commercial agreement negotiated by both parties, the import quotas for both countries have only been slightly relaxed compared to the original quotas. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Turkish military delegation led by General沃培 has arrived here this morning. High-ranking British and French officers greeted them at the station. This trip</p>
<p>London: Reuters has learned that the delegation led by Turkish General 沃培 is expected to arrive in London in the middle of next week to discuss British-Turkish economic and financial matters. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu invited British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds and French Chargé d'Affaires Baya for talks at 6 PM and is scheduled to return to his country tomorrow morning. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Moscow: A German economic delegation, led by Dr. Schnurr, a specialist from the Economic Department of the German Foreign Ministry, is expected to arrive here shortly to discuss various details of economic cooperation with the Soviet authorities. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Capital of Belgium: It has been learned that representatives from England and Belgium are scheduled to hold economic talks in London next week to promote trade between the two countries. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Munich: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived at Munich Central Station at 8:18 this morning. The Italian Consul General in Munich, Bitalli, greeted him at the station. At 8:33, Ciano's private train departed for Berlin. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Dutch Capital: A correspondent for the local "Telegraph" newspaper in Berlin claims that, according to the most reliable sources, Hitler's "peace proposal" essentially consists of two points: (1) the establishment of a buffer state in Poland; (2) the convocation of a five-power conference to resolve all outstanding issues. It is said that this proposal will be conveyed to the British and French governments by Mussolini. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Air Battles on the Western Front: British and German Aircraft Each Shoot Down Two; Saarbrücken Surrounded on Three Sides</h3>
<p>Paris: The European war has now lasted for a month. Officials here generally predict that French troops will soon occupy Saarbrücken. French Communiqué No. 54 was released yesterday, stating that German forces east of the Moselle River and French forces near the Luxembourg border engaged in heavy artillery fire yesterday. Allied and German aircraft also took to the air for combat. French officials believe that German forces will launch a major counterattack between Saarbrücken and Luxembourg to regain lost territory on the Rhine front. The German people of Saarbrücken have already evacuated. French forces have surrounded the city on three sides, and the German army will not be able to hold it for long. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>London: The Information Department has issued a statement stating, "Several British aircraft flew to northern Germany last night for reconnaissance and safely returned to base afterward. In addition, the battle situation between British and German aircraft on the Western Front in Germany yesterday is worth mentioning. A small squadron of our reconnaissance aircraft encountered a large squadron of enemy fighter planes and engaged them in combat, shooting down two enemy aircraft. The downing of one of these aircraft has been confirmed by the French." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement today stating that air combat occurred in the West, with two French aircraft and ten British aircraft engaging German aircraft. Over the North Sea, two British aircraft were shot down, and the German side also lost two aircraft. Since the start of the war a month ago, the German Air Force and anti-aircraft units have shot down a total of 37 French aircraft and 27 British aircraft. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris: Reports that French troops are advancing along the right bank of the Moselle River towards Trier indicate that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin has taken the lead in this area. At least as far as Trier, the railway is no longer available to the Germans. The large number of German prisoners captured by the French are all soldiers guarding the pillboxes of the Siegfried Line. General Gamelin's clearing operations are proceeding faster than most critics had anticipated. French forces have strengthened their position by advancing their lines on a five-and-a-half-mile front towards Bolchen, making it more secure and able to withstand any inevitable German counterattack. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: French forces have recently advanced east of the Moselle River, greatly increasing the amount of German territory occupied by the French. The general trend of military operations is now forming an encirclement, moving closer to the central salient of the Siegfried Line. Although German forces are currently putting up a strong resistance to French pressure, the French commander has not lost the initiative for a single day. The French are gradually advancing on the Siegfried Line, giving the impression that they are implementing their military operations according to plan, enabling them to advance accurately and with minimal casualties. When Germany attempts to counterattack, they encounter rapidly constructed defensive positions and concentrated artillery fire from the French, resulting in the failure of the German counterattacks to delay the French advance. There have been no large-scale military operations on either side in the past 24 hours. French forces are currently consolidating their newly captured positions east of Apach and Berg, while German forces are sending out reconnaissance patrols with fewer personnel than usual. Military commentators today say that German operations on the Luxembourg end of the Siegfried Line are greatly hampered, and the German side may soon violate Luxembourg's neutrality to allow German forces more room to maneuver. News from Switzerland that German forces are concentrating in the Black Forest has also attracted general attention, as the area contains a major German route to the Rhine River. While it is difficult for German forces to cross the Rhine, it should not be assumed that they cannot do so, as German forces crossed the Danube River at Belgrade in 1915 under French fire. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: According to official sources, British reconnaissance aircraft flew over the German Siegfried Line a few days ago and took many extremely detailed photographs. The positions of German artillery batteries, tank trenches, the German rear communications network, and various camouflage methods have all been photographed. These reconnaissance aircraft flew very low when photographing enemy terrain, sometimes as low as six hundred feet. Enemy anti-aircraft batteries often mistook them for German aircraft, allowing them to safely return to base. These photographs have all been submitted to the headquarters of the British Expeditionary Force. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Reaffirms Policy of Peace</h3>
<p>Moscow: An editorial in today's "Izvestia" states, "The Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, despite the conspiracies of certain countries that have tried hard to provoke a German-Soviet conflict, has finally been successfully concluded, becoming an obstacle to challengers inciting a pan-European war. This will certainly be recognized by all mankind, or at least by those with clear minds who can accurately assess the facts. The world must recognize this historical document as an extremely important instrument of peace. The world must know that if the Soviet Union had not consistently adhered to a policy of peace, if there had not been a Soviet-German treaty serving to implement this policy, the whole world would have been plunged into an unprecedented war, more terrible than the imperialist slaughter of 1914-1918. The current imperialist war in Europe has thus been localized and its scope reduced. Soviet leaders will never allow challengers to drag the country into an unnecessary war, thereby sparing 170 million people from the ravages of war. The expansion of the European war has also been limited." (TASS, 30th)</p>
<h3>Finnish Official Criticizes Soviet-Estonian Treaty</h3>
<p>Capital of Finland: Sven Tuomioja, Chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the Soviet-Estonian treaty yesterday, stating that Estonia has effectively lost its neutral status, that its foreign policy will be constrained by the Soviet Union, that it has become a military ally of the Soviet Union, and that it has completely submitted economically to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become the leader of the northern Baltic Sea. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Capital of Estonia: Estonian Navy Commander-in-Chief Mere has been dismissed today due to the escape of a Polish submarine. Several other senior military officers will be court-martialed. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden: According to reliable sources from all sides, Germany has granted the Soviet Union freedom of action in Latvia. However, the Soviet Union is unlikely to take drastic measures against Latvia, as it has done against Estonia. The first step is said to be a demand for special rights in the ports of Liepāja and Ventspils, so that the Soviet Union can have access to the sea in the areas it has already occupied in Poland.

<h3>German Side Attaches Importance to This Week's Developments; Hitler Still Hopes for a Change in the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to political figures here, the most important events for Germany and the world will occur this week. The convening of the German Parliament, the arrival of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Berlin, the German army's occupation of Warsaw, and the upcoming speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Daladier all indicate that this week will be a week of major international events. Whether England and France accept the German-Soviet peace proposal or continue to fight will be revealed this week. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hitler invited his Axis partner, the Italian Foreign Minister, to Berlin yesterday for an emergency meeting and scheduled a parliamentary session for next Thursday to deliver an important declaration. Hitler also met with cabinet members and key figures from the army and navy yesterday for a 50-minute discussion. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome: Regarding Foreign Minister Ciano's trip to Berlin, most newspapers have made little comment. Only the "Messenger" newspaper published a dispatch from its correspondent in Berlin, stating, "German leader Hitler is currently in Berlin and can personally receive Foreign Minister Ciano. The importance attached to this trip by German officials is evident. Moreover, this trip comes after Germany announced its willingness to present peace proposals jointly with the Soviet government, indicating that the European situation may have decisive developments within the next week." Furthermore, all newspapers believe that it is expected that Hitler will deliver an important speech and propose peace when the German Parliament convenes in the coming days, but it is still difficult to predict its scope and nature. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin at 6 PM today for a short visit, leaving for Rome no later than tomorrow evening. It is claimed here that Ciano's visit is a natural result of the new situation created by the German-Soviet agreement and will not produce any surprising developments. Germany, in view of the changing situation, hopes to contact key Italian figures to inform Italy of various new developments. This consultation is also an obligation stipulated in the German-Italian agreement. Ciano is expected to discuss with German authorities Mussolini's efforts for peace. Mussolini is eager to end the war as soon as possible. People here generally believe that Ciano's visit should not be seen as a surprising action, but the visit is valued because there will be important developments in the European situation this week. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Paris: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's trip to Berlin is being commented on here. It is widely believed that Germany, with the help of the Soviet Union, is likely to adopt a "peace offensive." The moderate "Order" newspaper reported that "Hitler intends for the 'peace offensive' to be awe-inspiring, and in addition to Soviet support, he should also court several countries to strengthen its momentum. Although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini expressed his support for peace in a speech to the leaders of the Fascist Party in Bologna on September 23, Hitler wants the country to implement the 'Pact of Steel' signed with Germany, not just pay lip service. This is why Ciano was invited to Germany." The right-wing "Petit Journal" stated, "The peace efforts of Germany and the Soviet Union are bound to fail. Germany and its allies will also be defeated in a protracted war. Hitler is well aware of this, so he plans to persuade the Catholic countries to mediate, but England and France will resolutely reject it, which can be asserted." The right-wing "Journal" stated that the German-Italian military and political agreement (established on May 28 of this year, the so-called Pact of Steel) stipulates that the signatory countries should exchange views whenever necessary. Ciano's trip to Berlin shows that the situation is no more serious than it is today. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Minorities in Germany Total 29 Million</h3>
<p>Dutch Capital: After Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned Polish territory, German newspapers described the areas that the country acquired at length, but deliberately omitted the number of minorities within the "Greater German Reich." In fact, before the partition of Poland, Germany already had 9 million Czechs, 1.5 million Poles, and 500,000 Slovaks within its borders, totaling 11 million, accounting for 12% of the country's total population. Today, with the addition of 18 million residents in the newly occupied areas of Poland, the total number of minorities has reached 29 million, equivalent to over 28% of the country's total population. From now on, Germany has become the second Slavic country in Europe (its total number of Slavic residents is second only to the Soviet Union), and it will undoubtedly become an excellent target for Soviet propaganda. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>French Military Authorities Confer, Discuss Strategy Against Germany; Resolve to Defeat Hitlerism, Unshaken by German-Soviet Declaration</h3>
<p>Paris: French Premier Daladier today held a meeting with cabinet members in charge of defense, such as Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin, Naval Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Darlan, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Vuillemin, to discuss "strategic issues of far-reaching importance." General Georges, commander of the northeastern army, who inspected the front line with President Lebrun yesterday, also attended the meeting. The meeting lasted half an hour. Afterward, Daladier met with President Lebrun for 45 minutes. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Supreme Military Council met here yesterday to consider the situation caused by the Soviet-German peace declaration. It is widely believed that the Council decided that the Soviet-German declaration would not change the European situation. French Prime Minister Daladier instructed a government spokesman to inform journalists that France did not view the Soviet-German peace proposal as well-intentioned or acceptable. It is widely believed that France does not want any neutral country to mediate peace with Germany. The French government is trying to convince the German public that the threats from Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy cannot change the Allies' established policy of defeating Hitlerism in Europe. Pierre Brisson, editor of "Le Petit Parisien," summarized France's reaction to the Soviet-German peace declaration as follows: "This is very honorable for Hitler. He has made Poland disappear from the map. He wants to become a great peacemaker, signing a Munich agreement with England, a Paris agreement with France, and then resting for a few months. He will then prepare to launch a new attack in Europe, on Belgium, on France, who knows if he will not attack Italy one day." (Associated Press, 1st)</p>

<h3>"Premature to Predict Peace"</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War has finally reached a conclusion, but what kind of conclusion? If left to run its natural course, what kind of conclusion would it reach? From China's perspective, what kind of conclusion should it reach? From Japan's perspective, what kind of conclusion should it reach? The immediate worries are such, the long-term concerns are like that, and how will it all conclude? For all these questions, the dominant and the subservient each have their own answers, making it extremely difficult to reach a consensus. Examining newspapers and magazines in both Shanghai and Tokyo, many commentators share a common malady. They invariably begin by hypothesizing a desired conclusion, and then seek reasons and explanations to support their conclusion, even to the point of distorting facts and reversing cause and effect. They spare no effort in slandering what they dislike and stop at nothing to vilify what they resent. Examples are too numerous to mention, too unbearable to cite. The momentous affairs of the two nations over a century cannot be resolved by mere eloquence, let alone by specious arguments. One only sees biased words, or thinks there is a shortcut to be found. In reality, they only add to the confusion and do little to resolve the situation, which is what discerning people lament. Mr. Tatsujiro Funatsu, a Japanese, recently told an English reporter for the American Evening News: "The Sino-Japanese war is still in an undecided stage. It is premature to predict peace between the two countries, as no one can say for sure how long the war will last." Mr. Funatsu has been in China for decades (the report says thirteen years, but the reporter remembers it being more), from Tianjin to Shanghai, from official to businessman, with a wealth of experience and a wide circle of friends. Since the January 28th Incident of 1932 to the present, he has suffered painful lessons. He has also gone from dazzling ambition to a more balanced outlook and is now retiring. At a time when the Japanese side believes there is a shortcut to be found, he makes the remark that it is "premature" to resolve the situation. Is this not the true insight of an elderly person?</p>
<p>Resolving this war situation could happen through a military solution, that is, the military forces of the belligerent countries, through a long period of combat, wax and wane, eventually reaching a point where one side has absolute strength for victory. In other words, Japan's forces are able to simultaneously control all of Northwest and Southwest China, and China's resistance forces completely disappear, which would be a Japanese victory. Otherwise, Japan's invading forces completely disappear, and China drives the Japanese army overseas, which would be a Chinese victory. This is one way to resolve the war. Or it could be due to political and economic reasons, either China has internal strife and no longer resists, or Japan has internal strife and no longer invades, or there are major international changes and immense power either oppresses Japan, or oppresses China, or simultaneously oppresses China and Japan. This is another way to resolve the war. The first way is in the midst of the struggle between the two sides, and we do not want to speculate. More than two years have passed, and to this day, both sides have confidence in this military solution. The second way is in the midst of the expectations of both sides, and we will not discuss the possibility of "change" being greater or more beneficial, but the mood of expecting the second way cannot be concealed by either side, but expecting the other side to change, expecting external changes, are all things without any certainty. The momentous affairs of the two nations over a century are floating and hesitating in this lack of certainty for each side. Can a resolution be expected?</p>
<p>From what we can perceive, although China cannot be certain of Japan's changes, or international changes, there are those who are enduring hardships and hesitations. Japan, being small, cannot be certain of China's and international changes, but its hesitation is actually greater. Considering the root of the war, China is passively resisting invasion and fighting for survival, so in fact, until the conditions for the nation's survival are absolutely guaranteed, there is absolutely no reason to give up the resistance. If it is said that the guarantee lies in China's sincerity and Japan's honesty, this is a subjective argument that may or may not be true, not a necessary objective fact. In Japan's case, is invasion necessary, must it be effective, can it be sustained, must it not be revised? Whether in theory, in intention, or in fact, at least none is absolute, none is inevitable, or even none is true. From the perspective of strategic gains and losses, the Japanese side has initially favored a quick and decisive victory. Now, wanting to stop but unable to, they still hope for a quick and decisive victory. Their talk of a ten-year war or a hundred-year war is unconscious bravado. Therefore, their pressing subtext is actually "If we cannot have a quick and decisive victory, then we only hope to be able to stop when we can." How to stop involves politeness, desires, and vanity, obscuring their wisdom. Therefore, they try to take detours as shortcuts, unable to restrain themselves. In China's case, it is clear that the quality of military equipment is inferior to others, but what is relied upon is quantity. Therefore, it is advantageous to "delay." Delay is not necessarily a problem. Albania in the past, and Poland recently, have problems in not being able to delay. Czechoslovakia and Austria's problem was in never delaying. If one can delay, why not delay? From the perspective of the international environment, Japan, with its wisdom unable to extricate itself, is being dragged by China. Furthermore, because of its international standing and other various relationships, it is extremely difficult to remain in a state of wavering ambiguity for a long time. China is only concerned with resisting Japan and can certainly ignore the various international groups and fronts. In order to cope with the international situation, Japan hopes that the so-called "China Incident" can be stopped as soon as possible. It also hopes to use China to its advantage in coping with international affairs, worrying that China will make it unable to cope with the international situation. In China's case, during this period of continued resistance, it can freely navigate the international scene through its resistance, without being subject to any restrictions. After the resistance ends, it will stand proudly as an independent and free country with complete sovereignty. No matter how chaotic the international situation, it will bury itself in rebuilding and educating the nation under subjective absolute neutrality, completing the great task of national construction and revival. If it is said that the Sino-Japanese War is able to be declared over by accepting certain restrictive conditions of the international community, but being involuntarily participating in a certain group or front of international chaos, then whether for the sake of current or long-term interests, it would rather drag Japan and continue the resistance until absolutely no restrictive conditions are accepted. In short, the day Japan is hostile to China is the day it loses its qualification to participate in world affairs. Assuming that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy are one camp, and Britain, France, and the United States are another camp, assuming that Japan has the same possibility of joining any camp, but it will be bogged down in the quagmire of China, making it impossible to choose. Even if it joins, it will be weakened by the quagmire, with little remaining strength. Therefore, from the perspective of the international environment, it is the Japanese side that urgently needs to end the Sino-Japanese war. As for profiting from the European war, China does not have such extravagant hopes, and Japan should remember this.</p>
<p>The Japanese must know all that has been said above. The reason why they are trapped in hesitation and unable to extricate themselves is that they are blinded by politeness, desires, and vanity, still hoping to find a shortcut. On the Chinese side, as in the recent talks by Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, it was frank, straightforward, and unhindered. Even if those who misunderstand it point to it as seeking peace, pointing to it as seeking the United States, it is not enough to erase his distinction between peace and war. I hope that Japan today will want to make a frank and straightforward statement, but is unable to. For advance means war, and retreat means peace, all depending on Japan's actual actions, and Japan is hesitating like this. It is appropriate for discerning people to observe that "it is premature to predict peace!"</p>
<h3>The United States Strengthens the Far East Fleet's Strength, Hawaii to Hold Naval Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department strictly maintains secrecy regarding the movements of U.S. warships. Even the movements of the fleet expected to arrive in Hawaii in the third week to participate in exercises are not being announced by the Navy Department. The Navy Department's orders state that the reason for this secrecy is to implement "neutrality patrols." Although these "neutrality patrols" have not yet been implemented on the West Coast, important naval ports such as San Diego and San Pedro have received orders. The date of the Hawaiian Grand Maneuvers may not be announced publicly. More than one hundred warships and multiple aircraft carriers will participate in these Grand Maneuvers. The Navy Department also stated that it will increase the submarine strength of the Far East Fleet. After the new submarines arrive in the Far East, the old submarines will continue to serve and will not be withdrawn. With the addition of the aircraft carrier "Langley" and fourteen long-range bombers that arrived in Manila ten days ago, the strength of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet is already very strong.

<h3>Observations from Chongqing: The Soviet Union Will Still Aid China, Little Possibility of Soviet-Japanese Compromise</h3>
<p>Chongqing: News of a possible compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan, as reported by Rome, and that a tripartite alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan could be formed, is seen here as another way to pressure Britain. This news indicates that if Japan can advance south and threaten British interests, the Soviet Union is prepared to form an alliance with it. Those familiar with current affairs here believe that the Soviet Union is willing to assist in any action that could destroy the British Empire. The joint German-Soviet declaration is the most recent expression of this Soviet attitude. However, most people here believe that even if the Soviet Union and Japan compromise, the Soviet Union will not cease its aid to China. The Soviet Union has always maintained China's integrity, mainly because if China can remain intact, then there will be no problems for Siberia and the Maritime Provinces of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union will never help Japan conquer China. As for Britain compromising with Japan to prevent Japan's southward advance, it will be more detrimental to China than a Soviet-Japanese compromise. According to military sources, the possibility of a Soviet-Japanese compromise is extremely small, because before the armistice, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the Harbin River area. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining its honor, the Kwantung Army will soon seek revenge on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. (United Press, 1st)</p>

<h3>German Submarine Warfare Intensifies, Declares Merchant Ships Will Be Treated the Same as Warships, Four Danish Ships Intercepted En Route to Britain</h3>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information announced that a German radio station broadcast news yesterday claiming that in the past few days, German submarines have been attacked by British armed merchant ships. The German submarines have always respected international law and have always given prior warning before attacking merchant ships. However, in the future, in retaliation, they will change this attitude and treat British merchant ships the same as warships. It goes without saying that this German slander is completely unfounded. The British Admiralty, for the sake of precaution, has informed all merchant ships that German submarine warfare methods are about to intensify, so that they can take extra precautions. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the speech made by British Naval Minister Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain plans to arm every merchant ship, the German newspapers today launched another large-scale attack. The "Hamburg Foreign Newspaper" declared that Germany has heard this intimidation and knows how to deal with it. In order to make Britain understand the possible consequences, it is explained that Germany's view on submarine warfare is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) No merchant ship may offer any resistance to measures taken by submarines according to the right of capture. (2) Armed merchant ships do not automatically become warships or auxiliary cruisers, but if they attack enemy ships, the enemy may treat them as warships because they are engaged in war activities. (3) The responsibility for illegally armed merchant ships rests entirely with the government under whose flag the merchant ship is sailing. (4) Neutral passengers who wish to travel on armed merchant ships bear the risk themselves. (Haitong Telegraph, 1st)</p>
<p>The Hague: A correspondent for the local "Electric News" recently telegraphed from the Danish capital that the four Danish ships "Roda," "Diana," "Margaret," and "Linus," carrying food to Britain, were all intercepted by German warships en route. The news has greatly shocked the Danish people, as the goods carried by these ships cannot be regarded as contraband. In addition, after the Norwegian freighter "Solaris" was sunk by a German warship the other day, the owner arrived in Denmark yesterday. According to him, the German warship did not issue a warning before attacking the ship. The Danish authorities and people are becoming increasingly concerned about the safety of navigation. In addition, the German government has announced that grain carried by neutral ships will not be regarded as contraband unless it is delivered to enemy government offices. The grain carried by the above four ships was not delivered to the British government, but was arbitrarily detained by German warships, which is puzzling. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced yesterday that the German blockade of Britain has also been dealt with in the same way. In the past forty-eight hours, German warships have searched a total of forty-five ships, many of which have been escorted to German ports and the goods confiscated. Regarding the British air force bombing of the Heligoland fleet on Thursday, the military also released additional information, stating that two German destroyers were forced to land on the sea, and the crew were rescued by German warships. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<h3>Belgium Increases Defense on Northern Border, German-Dutch Traffic Cut Off</h3>
<p>Paris: The "Paris Evening News" received news from Luxembourg last night that Belgian troops stationed on the French border have suddenly been transferred to the northern Belgian border near the Netherlands. Belgian troops are building new defensive fortifications on the Albert Canal and the Demer River. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>(Ottenchael, German-Dutch border) The German military has ordered German troops here to keep a distance of at least three hundred English feet from the Dutch border, and German people are prohibited from contacting Dutch soldiers, causing the situation here to suddenly become tense. Starting from 5:00 AM tomorrow, the border between the two countries will be closed, prohibiting all traffic. Dutch people are not allowed to enter German territory, except in a certain place near the village of Granna, where they can pass if they obtain a special pass. This special pass must be signed by the head of the German Defense Forces before it is valid. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<h3>Germany Rebuts British Excerpt</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German government had published a White Paper explaining the events leading to the German-Polish conflict. The British tried to prove its errors, and today the German authorities made a strong rebuttal. It is said that the German White Paper has collected all the key documents, but the editing of the documents has principles, and documents describing the general climate, as well as records of conversations, are not included. If the British use this as an excuse to accuse the German government of intending to conceal important information, then the method they adopt is inevitably naive. The following are the main points of the British refutation that are refuted:</p>
<p>(1) The British claimed that the German White Paper sought to state that Britain opposed Germany's right to issue an ultimatum to Poland at the beginning of Germany's ultimatum to Poland. According to the ultimatum, Poland had to send an envoy to Berlin at 12:00 PM on August 30 and had to accept Germany's proposal. The German side replied that the British claim that Germany's request was an ultimatum was inconsistent with the facts. The German government did not cause any consequences for the deadline of August 30. Only on the night of August 31 did it believe that diplomatic strategies had been exhausted. The British intelligence office, after consulting the report of its ambassador (which has been reprinted in the Blue Book), knew that Chancellor Hitler had answered Ambassador Henderson's question with "of course." What Mr. Henderson asked was whether the Polish envoy could conduct negotiations based on the principle of complete equality. From this, the British attitude can be seen. As for the attitude of the British, the German government did not know until the night of August 30 that the British government believed that the contact between Germany and Poland on August 30 was impossible to implement.</p>
<p>(2) The British also claimed that the author of the White Paper and the German government ignored Poland's right to know, consider, and respond to Germany's proposal. The German side replied that according to the reply in the previous article, it can be seen that the procedure of the German proposal and the wishes of the Polish government can coexist without conflict. Furthermore, the British government still had the opportunity to notify Poland of the content of the German proposal on August 31, because Ambassador Henderson had reported the German proposal to London on the 30th and transmitted it to the British Embassy in Warsaw. The British Blue Book reveals the existence of this fact. (Haitong Telegraph, 1st)</p>
<h3>Terauchi's Party Left Berlin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Berlin: Former Japanese Army Minister Juichi Terauchi left Berlin this afternoon after staying in Germany for two weeks. He led his staff, including Colonel Yasuda, Major Kaneda, and Major Kato, to Nuremberg and Munich for sightseeing, and then took the Japanese ship Fushimi Maru from Naples, Italy, to return home. According to reports, Terauchi came to Germany at the invitation of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and met with Chancellor Hitler on September 20 for a half-hour talk. He then went to the Eastern and Western fronts to observe the German army's operations. After returning to Berlin, he visited various labor front agencies yesterday and the day before yesterday. Before leaving by train this afternoon, Terauchi met with reporters and gave a speech, praising the excellence of the German troops on the Eastern and Western fronts and expressing his admiration. Finally, Terauchi hoped that the German nation would have a great future. (Haitong Telegraph, 1st)</p>

<h3>The Battle Outside Changsha: Chinese Forces Gain the Upper Hand; Japanese Troops Completely Annihilated East of Qiaotouyi; Chinese Forces Also Report Victory at Dayun Mountain; Phoenix Mountain and Other Locations Recovered</h3>
<p>Guilin: The battle situation outside Changsha has clearly taken a turn for the better. A high-ranking Chinese officer, after arriving at the front lines, immediately directed the various armies to launch a major counteroffensive. From Qiaotouyi to Longmenchang, along a 200-kilometer line, fierce battles are taking place everywhere. Among them, Dahaozhuao (45 li east of Qiaotouyi) and the southeast of Pingjiang are particularly intense. By yesterday morning, over a thousand Japanese troops at Dahaozhuao had been completely annihilated by Chinese forces, with almost no survivors. This is the most significant defeat the Japanese army has suffered since crossing the Mishui River. Chinese forces in other areas have also made considerable gains. In this battle in northern Hunan, although the Japanese army used mobile units to occupy some Chinese strongholds, due to the terrain, heavy weaponry and mechanized units have completely lost their effectiveness. The Chinese forces, on the other hand, can utilize the familiar mountainous terrain to cut off the lines between strongholds at any time, causing each point to be isolated and unstable. According to news from the front this afternoon, 7,000 to 8,000 Japanese troops northeast of Changsha are trapped between Qiaotouyi and Jinjing, awaiting reinforcements due to the Chinese counteroffensive. As for the Japanese troops advancing southwest from Longmenchang towards Pingjiang, over 2,000 of them were engaged in battle on the 30th in the Qilishant area west of Changshou Street, which they captured on the 29th. Another group of Japanese troops advancing south from near Pingjiang encountered strong resistance from Chinese forces at Jiangcun (15 kilometers south of Pingjiang) and Hengcha (10 kilometers southeast of Pingjiang), suffering heavy casualties. This group of Japanese troops seems to be trying to join forces with the Japanese troops advancing west from Changshou Street. Another small group in civilian clothing is fleeing southwest, attempting to infiltrate Shegang (30 kilometers southwest of Pingjiang). In addition, intense fighting is also reported on the Mufu Mountain side north of Pingjiang. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Gao'an: Chinese forces launched an attack on Japanese troops near Phoenix Mountain northeast of Gao'an on the night of the 30th, encountering over two hundred Japanese troops. After fierce fighting for a long time, the Japanese were defeated and retreated by the morning of the 1st. The Chinese then recovered Phoenix Mountain, Lailong Mountain, and Yanzi Cliff, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers and seizing seven rifles, documents, and a large amount of military supplies. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: Military news: According to refugees who escaped from Xinqiang, the Japanese Sixth Division suffered extremely heavy casualties in the battle south of Xinqiang. There were over a thousand corpses, which were transported to Gaiweiyue. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang: According to a telephone call from Changsha, the fighting along the northern section of the Yuehan Railway is still stable.

<p>Hong Kong: According to military news obtained here today, the Japanese army has now advanced to a location 30 kilometers from Changsha and is engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces on the outer lines of Changsha. The Japanese army is forming a semi-circle around Changsha, and the Chinese forces are putting up strong resistance. It is reported that yesterday, after the Japanese army advanced to Qingshan City, one part of it attacked eastward, and was repulsed by Chinese forces at Jinjing, south of Pingjiang. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered 2,000 casualties. According to a statement issued by the spokesperson of the General Headquarters Military Affairs Bureau, since the fall of Wuhan last winter, Changsha has lost its military importance, especially during the war in Europe, and we must prepare for a long-term war. According to the spokesperson, since the beginning of the war of resistance, the Chinese strategy has been to wage a war of attrition against the Japanese. The gain or loss of a single city is not important. Furthermore, in Hunan alone, up to September 14th, the Chinese forces have annihilated four Japanese divisions. As for the Japanese forces annihilated by the Chinese forces in Jiangxi, they amount to three divisions. The spokesperson finally stated that the current goal of the Japanese military is to attempt to control Changsha, Changde, and Yichang. (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: News received here today from the front lines of the Chinese army stated that some of the vanguard troops of the Japanese army have now reached the outskirts of Changsha. The Japanese troops north of Changsha are advancing south along the Yuehan Road, and it is reported that they reached Qiaotouyi yesterday morning. At the same time, the Japanese troops advancing towards Changsha from the east along the highway have reached Sanmiao City and Qingshan City (both transliterations) and Yongan City. Therefore, the Japanese army is now less than thirty miles from Changsha. A spokesperson for the Chinese army made a statement this morning regarding the rapid advance of the Japanese army, reiterating that the Chinese army commander intends to avoid positional warfare east of the Yuehan Road. It is said that since the fall of Hankou, Changsha is no longer an important position from a military perspective. Since the outbreak of the European war, China must continue to prepare for a long-term war of resistance. The spokesperson finally pointed out that in this battle in Hunan Province, the Chinese army has inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter, due to the intense fighting in the Hunan and Hubei areas, visited the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission to inquire about the recent battle situation in the Hunan and Hubei areas. It was reported that the goal of this Japanese offensive is clearly the line of Changsha, Changde, and Yichang. Our military strategy has long been determined to be a comprehensive war, with the aim of depleting the enemy's forces and striking at their main force. We will never contend for the gain or loss of a single city. Since the outbreak of the war, we have adhered to this policy without any changes. This battle in Hunan and Hubei is also the same. Moreover, since the abandonment of Wuhan last winter, Changsha is no longer a key point in our strategy, especially since the beginning of the European war. Our army should make plans for a protracted war and to deplete the enemy, and we are unwilling to engage in positional warfare in the area east of the Yuehan Line. Therefore, our army's future strategy is entirely to strike at the main force of the Japanese army, seeking to achieve the goal of a war of attrition. As for the gain or loss of any strongholds, it is not related to the final victory. In this battle in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, since it began on the 14th of this month, our army has annihilated more than half of the Japanese Inaba Division, Kan'ishi Division, Fujita Division, and Ogi Division, and that does not include the three divisions in Jiangxi that were defeated by our army.

<p>Fancheng: Since the Chinese army launched a full-scale offensive in central Hubei, the Japanese troops in various places have been very panicked and have been frequently transferring troops to reinforce them in different directions, and recruiting civilian laborers to rush to repair highways, so as to reinforce each front line at any time. Yangzi has also increased its Japanese forces by over a hundred, attempting to defend its strongholds. Although the Japanese troops invading central Anhui have been repelled by the Chinese forces, the Japanese troops' goal is to seize food in the vicinity of Lujiang and Chaohu, and recently they are still attempting to infiltrate Yunchao from the Xiangxikou area from time to time. The Chinese have already sent powerful troops to guard against them. (1st dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: According to Japanese official broadcasts, this operation in northern Hunan has achieved nothing and is unprecedented in the many battles fought in China. The Japanese admitted that they are finding it difficult to advance because they are ambushed by Chinese forces everywhere. They also stated that the battles at Fulipu and Sanjieyu suffered particularly heavy damage, and they praised the spirit of heroic sacrifice of the Chinese defenders in those two places. It is reported that the □□□ division defended the area around Fulipu, and the Japanese attacked that place fiercely for several days and nights, and were repelled by brave fighting. Unable to disturb it, they had no choice but to change and harass Jinjing to the east. The Chinese achieved great results in blocking them. As for the area of Qijie Bridge in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, it was defended by the □□□ unit, which not only delayed the actions of the Japanese army invading south, but also caused them to suffer huge losses. All of this is enough to prove that the Chinese army is becoming stronger and stronger. It is now known that Chairman Jiang has repeatedly praised the assistance of □, which is highly commended.

According to Chinese who have arrived here from the Kowloon border, Shatoujiao has been recaptured by Chinese forces, and Shenzhen is surrounded by 5,000 Chinese troops. It is reported that the Japanese troops defending Shenzhen number only 1,500, so the Japanese army can only take a defensive posture. Moreover, in order to disperse the Japanese army's strength, the Chinese army has deliberately stretched the front line to a width of thirty miles. (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>

The second time, twenty-seven Japanese planes flew towards Chongqing at 9:00 PM, but after circling the city over Wanxian, they flew towards Hankou without dropping bombs. According to observations here, the reason why the Japanese planes did not drop bombs was that the clouds and fog were dense west of Wanxian, making it inconvenient.

<p>Paris: The Polish embassy here recently issued a communique stating that President Mościcki had resigned today, and the vacancy was filled by Dr. Raczkiewicz, the former speaker of the Senate. The new president was sworn in at the Polish embassy in France. Ambassador Łukasiewicz, General Sikorski, commander-in-chief of the Polish army in France, and many other dignitaries were all present. After taking office, President Raczkiewicz first dismissed the Składkowski cabinet and authorized General Sikorski to form a new cabinet, which has now been announced.

<h3>A Miserable Defeat for Japanese and Puppet Troops in Zhongshan; Fierce Fighting All Day; Three Routes Fled in Disarray; Over 300 Japanese and Puppet Troops Ambushed and Captured</h3>
<p>Shiqi Correspondence: Over the past two months, Japanese and puppet troops have peeped into Zhongshan three times. The first time, they invaded east of Zhongshan, concentrating on Jinzhong. The second time, they invaded west of Zhongshan, concentrating on Dieshi. From the middle of this month to the present, the third time, they have concentrated on the Hengmen Dawangtou area north of Zhongshan. However, in the first two times, only a small number of warships dispatched by the Japanese command assisted the puppet troops in the invasion, so they were unable to withstand a single blow from the Chinese self-defense teams. This third time, the two sides confronted each other for nearly ten days. Japanese and puppet troops dispatched land, sea, and air forces to invade with all their strength, launching fierce battles on three fronts. It was not until September 22 that the self-defense teams completely repelled the Japanese and puppet troops.</p>
<p>On September 15, Japanese and puppet troops concentrated their ships at Hengmen and invaded Xiaoyin, Licun, Zhangjiabian, and other areas. After being repelled by the Zhongshan self-defense teams, on the 18th, the Japanese army in Guangzhou transferred several hundred troops from the Akita unit, and Lu Chunrong also dispatched about a thousand puppet pacification troops to launch a large-scale invasion. Japanese fleets and aircraft also assisted in the advance. The central route took Dawangtou as its stronghold and invaded Xiaoyin and Dahuan. The left wing invaded from the Furong Mountain and Baimi Mountain area. The right wing took advantage of large warships to capture Zhangjiabian. On the 19th and 20th, the Japanese and puppet troops were fierce and menacing, and bombed the Chinese army's positions with a large number of planes. In order to avoid sacrifice, the Chinese army gradually withdrew to the Xiaoyin Licun Dahuan line. At that time, Shiqi was shaken, and the situation was precarious. On the 21st, fresh Chinese troops were transferred from a certain direction to Shiqi and added to the front lines. Various commanders personally went to the front lines to direct the battles. After fierce fighting all day, the Japanese and puppet troops on the central route were first repelled, and Dahuan, Xiaoyin, and other places were recovered. On the same afternoon, the Chinese army won victories on the left and right wings at Baimi Mountain and Zhangjiabian, killing over two hundred Japanese and puppet troops and recovering the positions in the Licun, Baimi Mountain, and Zhangjiabian areas. As a result, the Japanese and puppet troops on all three routes fled in disarray, gathering at Dawangtou Shanzhoukeng for accommodation, because the area was near the Hengmen coast and the Japanese and puppet troops could rely on the protection of the gunboats to hold on. Since the 23rd, there have been no traces of Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangjiabian, Xiaoyin Licun, Dahuan, Baimi Mountain, and Furong Mountain. Only a corner of Dawangtou still has puppet troops that have not retreated. The Chinese army is handling the post-war reconstruction, so it has temporarily suspended the attack on the 23rd and 24th. The situation in Zhongshan has suddenly eased. When the Chinese army launched a counterattack against the Japanese and puppet troops on the three routes north of Shiqi on the 21st (the battle was extremely fierce), it was unexpected that more than forty Japanese and puppet rubber boats, loaded with hundreds of puppet troops, suddenly appeared on the Shenwan sea surface south of Zhongshan, secretly landing near Shenwan, attempting to attack Qianshan and cut off Shiqi's retreat. The Chinese army had learned of this in advance and immediately dispatched self-defense teams to cooperate with the people's groups in various villages to lay in ambush and be prepared. When the Japanese and puppet troops had landed halfway, the ambushers rose up together and intercepted them head-on, capturing more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops on the spot and seizing more than 100 guns. This battle was the only victory since the start of the war in Zhongshan, but the captured prisoners were mostly puppet troops, with only a dozen of them being Taiwanese. The prisoners have been dispatched by the Sixth District Command and the county government, along with soldiers, to a certain supreme command for disposal.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Jiashan: Poisonous Atmosphere Pervades, Epidemics Rampant, Many Deaths</h3>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: After the fall of Jiashan, the Japanese and puppet regime, in order to implement a policy of poisoning the people, established so-called "official opium dens" to promote opium sales. The price was much lower than in Shanghai, so general opium addicts flocked to them. The puppet director of the dens, Sun Wenbing, and the head of the Japanese Comfort Corps, Ogata, occupied about half of all the dens. Others, such as Yu Yunmen and Lu Jimin, also invested 1,500 [yuan], more or less. Recently, the head of the Japanese Comfort Corps merged all thirty-one "swallow houses" into five, on a particularly large scale, which shows their rigorous implementation of the poisoning policy. Generally, merchants in Pinghu who trade raw opium, whose shipments were previously obstructed and greatly affected, have now fully recovered. Opium addicts are being registered and ID cards are being issued by the puppet county government, costing between 3 jiao and 2 jiao per card. In Songjiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu areas, epidemics are rampant, and deaths follow one after another. There are also quite a few deaths among the Japanese soldiers, mostly cremated on the spot. Those who have already been coffined have their coffins burned. The residents' previously issued passes are all invalid. Recently, they have been using a "convenience examination certificate," checking feces and urine. If there are no epidemic bacteria, a new pass can be obtained with the certificate, but it is said that the convenience examination certificates will be abolished from October 1st. The epidemic situation in Zhapu is even more serious, and the people held a Wen Yuan Shuai festival in the hope of slightly reducing the epidemic.</p>
<h3>Overseas Fujianese: Enthusiastic Remittances Home; Reached 10 Million Yuan Each in July and August</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese in Nanyang who make a living have been enthusiastically remitting money back to China, averaging more than 4.5 million yuan per month. However, the months of July and August broke the two-year record, reaching 10 million yuan each. Among them, the Philippines and Singapore were the largest, each about 3 million yuan, followed by Yangon, Surabaya, Java, Penang, Sumatra, San Shimlun, Thailand, and Vietnam. The counties receiving the funds are Jinjiang, Yongchun, Nan'an, Hui'an, Longxi, Fuqing, and other counties, all belonging to the southern Fujian area. It is found that southern Fujian has an annual trade deficit of about 30 million yuan, which is made up for by remittances from overseas Chinese. Since the Japanese warships blockaded the ports in May of this year, imports of goods have almost disappeared, and all imported goods have skyrocketed in price. Fortunately, there are huge amounts of overseas remittances to provide assistance, so social life has not yet experienced a serious panic. However, the number of overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country has been greatly reduced. It is estimated that in July and August, the number of people leaving the country was more than 700 per month, and the number of people returning to the country was 150.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Wujiang: Prices Soar, Japanese and Puppet Authorities Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>Wujiang Correspondence: Wujiang, located on the Sujia Road, is a land of fish and rice. The puppet magistrate Zhu Yuanzhi, recently feeling that the guerrillas in the four townships are strong and his puppet orders cannot be smoothly delivered to the remote countryside, invested in hiring a Jianghu opera troupe to perform in the Cao Wang Temple, praying for peace. Zhu himself went to burn incense and pray, asking the Cao Wang deity to eliminate the guerrillas, which is truly an unthinkable joke. Copper coins have long disappeared in the city of Wujiang, and various substitute coupons are emerging in large numbers, leaving the people at a loss. The price of goods is shockingly high, at least four or five times higher than before. Those who earn four or five yuan a month or earn a thousand wen a day, with several mouths to feed, have difficulty maintaining their lives. In the countryside, there are even more thieves. The weak endure hunger and cold, a family weeping against each other covered with straw mats, while the strong take the risk of becoming bandits. In Tongli Town in the east of the county, a small number of Japanese and puppet troops are stationed, and they strictly inspect the residents. The inspections are especially tight in the streets and teahouses every day. Anyone returning from afar, without a pass or resident certificate, will be made difficult in every way. Residents in the town are in awe and dare not leave the town, otherwise they cannot cross the thunder pool a step.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Self-Defense Corps Kills Three Japanese Soldiers and Destroys Inland Waterway Shipping Association</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Zhou Hanliang, the captain of the Self-Defense Corps brigade in the western district of this county, led his team on the second of this month to burn down the Japanese military headquarters in the Xie Xin Woolen Mill and killed more than a dozen Japanese soldiers. The day before yesterday afternoon, the captain led five guards from the countryside to the city. At two thirty in the afternoon, they went to the Wuxi branch of the Inland Waterway Civilian Shipping Association, organized by the Japanese military in the Shenhe warehouse of Ronghu Village, three miles outside the North Gate. At that time, eighty or ninety boat owners were reporting their donations. The captain and others bravely rushed into the Japanese office in the crowd and opened fire on the Japanese who were working in the office. The president of the branch, Japanese Takashi Hiroshi (also known as Takashi Ichi), the accountant Nagata (also known as Yakushiji), and the translator Chen Hanliang (from Danyang) were all shot dead. The captain, seeing that the mission was accomplished, ordered the team members to take off the military uniforms worn by the Japanese corpses, destroy the branch, and collect the books and records used, and then calmly return to the countryside to rejoin the team. At that time, nearby Japanese military police, puppet pacification troops, and puppet police agencies heard the news and went to search, but there was no way to capture them.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate to Debate Neutrality Act Amendment Today; Isolationist General to Broadcast, Supporting Roosevelt's Policy</h3>
<p>Washington: The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has been forwarded to the Senate Secretariat. The Senate is scheduled to consider it on the second of next month. The Foreign Relations Committee has made public its review opinion, which states that the arms and military supplies embargo provisions contained in the current Neutrality Act must be completely abolished. As long as these provisions exist, the United States will not be able to maintain neutrality. Moreover, current international law stipulates that belligerent countries may purchase all goods from neutral countries, a provision that has long been accepted by belligerent and neutral countries alike. It is incomprehensible that the United States alone refuses to comply. (30th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: Smith, a key figure in the Democratic Party (the 1928 presidential candidate, who opposed President Roosevelt's re-election in the 1936 election), delivered a radio address yesterday, enthusiastically supporting the government's position on the issue of amending the current Neutrality Act and abolishing the arms embargo provisions. He said, "The Neutrality Act amendment drafted by the government is the only good way to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war. It is extremely fair, full of common sense and patriotism. Those who oppose it are simply ignorant of the actual situation." Some say that it would be sufficient to restore the international laws on neutrality, so why start anew? This statement is reasonable, "but who knows that some countries have long ceased to comply with international law, and even if they are restored, what benefit would there be?" As for distinguishing between contraband and non-contraband goods in wartime, several cargo ships of Sweden and Norway, which were not carrying contraband, were also sunk by German submarines. How can one expect Germany to distinguish between the United States' embargoed and non-embargoed goods? The position adopted by Germany can be summed up in one sentence: all goods destined for Britain are contraband. According to this, those in our country who oppose the abolition of the embargo provisions are almost openly declaring, "All ships of our country may as well be sunk." Conversely, those who agree do not want to allow "all ships of our country to be sunk," that's all. (1st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Bridge, a candidate for the party in next year's election, originally known for advocating isolationism, made a radio address here today, with wording and arguments that tended to agree with President Roosevelt's views. He said, "We have great concern for the events happening abroad. As a free nation living under a democratic system, we cannot but feel disgusted with the likes of Hitler and Stalin, and everything they represent, and we do not want to see the expansion of National Socialism and Communism, and we must especially prevent these ideologies from extending their influence to the American continent, and we will not hesitate to engage in struggle to achieve this goal. However, we have no responsibility for the disturbances in Central Europe and the boundary disputes caused there. Therefore, no American should go to Europe to fight for other countries. I advocate that members of the U.S. Congress must stay in Washington during the European war and quickly amend the current Neutrality Act. Our country's factories should first accept orders from our country's defense agencies and step up the manufacture of aircraft needed by our country. However, the goods ordered by foreign governments should also begin to be manufactured, and once the current Neutrality Act is amended, allowing aircraft to be transported to the belligerent countries, they can be delivered as scheduled. In short, we should pursue a policy of non-interference, while still striving to strengthen our national defense, so that in the event of an emergency, we can go out to fight with powerful strength. As long as the current situation does not change, we will not change our attitude, nor should we change our attitude." (30th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman made a statement yesterday, saying that according to the current Johnson Act, Britain and France cannot obtain loans from the United States, but Germany, because it does not owe war debts, can borrow money in the United States. Political figures here have commented that the U.S. military occupied the Rhineland region of Germany after the last European war, with expenses totaling $508,000,000, which should have been paid by Germany, but has not yet been paid. Pittman did not pay attention to this, but in fact, according to the Johnson Act, Germany is also not allowed to obtain loans from the United States, the situation is exactly the same as Britain and France.

<h3>Pan-American Conference Secret Meeting Passes Declaration of Economic Cooperation; Safety Zone Set Up Around the Americas; Peace Committee Passes U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>Panama City: The Pan-American Conference held a full secret meeting this afternoon and unanimously passed the Declaration of Economic Cooperation of the Pan-American countries, which will be submitted to an open meeting for a vote. The content is divided into ten articles, which are synthesized from twenty-seven proposals, stipulating the establishment of a standing advisory committee, composed of one representative appointed by the governments of the twenty-one American republics, to meet in Washington before November 15 to discuss (1) the consolidation of economic and financial institutions, (2) the maintenance of budget balance, (3) the stability of currency values, (4) the adjustment of industrial activities, (5) the increase of agricultural production, (6) the development of commercial relations.

<p>Panama City: Regarding the issue of setting up a safety zone around the American continent, the Peace Committee of the Pan-American Conference recently passed the "Panama Declaration" draft proposed by the U.S. representative by an overwhelming majority (only Chile has not yet agreed among the twenty-one representatives). The content is to draw a safety zone in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with an average width of 300 miles, starting from the border between the United States and Canada, passing through the Bermuda Islands (British), Cuba, the seas of South American countries, to Cape Horn (at the tip of South America), folding into the Pacific Ocean, and north through the Galapagos Islands, to the border between the United States and Canada. Within this zone, the naval fleets of one or more American countries should be responsible for patrolling, or sharing the work, or jointly doing it, all are acceptable. However, there are difficulties in the patrolling affairs, such as Chile, with its scattered islands and reefs, enough to be a hiding place for German submarines, and it is not easy to monitor. In addition, certain Latin American countries are concerned that the U.S. fleet patrolling their seas, even if it is temporary, may form a kind of right, and that the United States may be drawn into the vortex of the European war. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>Panama City: The Pan-American Conference continued to hold a full secret meeting today, and unanimously decided not to set a closing date until the work of the Neutrality and Peace Committees is completed. The Neutrality Committee then continued to meet and submitted the proposals on the export of food and non-military supplies put forward by the representatives of Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay for discussion.

<h3>Chiang Wei-kuo Arrives in America from Europe</h3>
<p>New York: Chiang Wei-kuo, the second son of General Chiang Kai-shek, 23 years old, arrived here yesterday from Europe aboard the "Amstelsteden" mail ship. Accompanying him were the wife of Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, and one son. The son was accompanied by Chinese Air Force Lieutenant Cai Jun. Both enjoyed diplomatic privileges and were given special treatment by U.S. Customs. He is currently under the protection of New York Consul General Yu Junji. Chinese here hope that Chiang will be able to attend "China Day" at the New York World's Fair on October 10, when Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Hu Shi will give a speech. "China Day" at the World's Fair is initiated by the United Relief Association for Chinese Civilians and 56 other Chinese organizations. Colonel Roosevelt (son of former President Roosevelt) and the mayor of New York will attend the grand event. Yu Junji did not want to disclose Chiang's future plans and strongly opposed publishing the passenger list of the "Amstelsteden." He claimed that Chiang was relatively secretive during the Atlantic crossing. Chiang studied at the Munich Military Academy in Germany and holds the rank of second lieutenant.

<h3>Philippine Chinese Newspapers Issue Announcement to Shan State</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Yesterday, five Chinese newspapers in the Philippines published editorials with similar content, believing that the arrest of hundreds of Chinese by Shan State (Siam) is a distressing event. China and Shan State have always had friendly relations, and the Chinese have made many contributions to the economic position of Shan State. The Shan State government should not be provoked by third parties and alienate the relations between China and Shan State. We hope that the Shan government can seriously choose friends. China has always adopted a generous and tolerant policy towards its neighbors, and in recent years, towards Shan State, in addition to taking care of overseas Chinese, there has been no request. At this time when China is resisting aggressors, Shan State should sympathize with China. Now it is adopting a high-pressure policy against overseas Chinese, which is truly unfortunate. (1st, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a group of Chinese merchants who arrived here from Shan State (Siam), the anti-Chinese movements in Shan State are still ongoing. Eight of the nine Chinese newspapers have been banned and stopped publication. Journalists and teachers who participated in patriotic movements have been arrested and imprisoned. Donations from overseas Chinese to help relieve the suffering of Chinese soldiers have been confiscated. The number of hours for teaching Chinese language in schools has been reduced from 27 hours per week to six hours. Chinese businessmen are subject to harsh taxation. The anti-Chinese movement is entirely driven by Japanese propaganda. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Continues to Relieve Social Education Workers by Registering 235 People and Assigning Them to Serve in Various Provinces and Cities in the Interior</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui have fallen one after another. Due to environmental factors, the social education institutions in the war zones have been unable to advance their work, and the staff have also retreated to the interior one after another. The Ministry of Education believes that these employees are far from their homes and their lives are worrying, and that they all have experience in social education work and should continue to be given work to provide relief and promote wartime private education work. Therefore, it ordered the education departments of Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces and the Chongqing municipal government to handle the registration. As of now, a total of one thousand one hundred and thirty-five people have registered. In addition to a part of them being organized by the Ministry into two social education work groups, the rest have been assigned to the education departments of various provinces for employment. Currently, the first social education work group has 190 members, the second social education work group has 238 members, 207 have been assigned to the Hunan Provincial Education Department, 324 have been assigned to the Hubei Provincial Education Department, 76 have been assigned to the Henan Provincial Education Department, 77 have been assigned to the Shaanxi Provincial Education Department, 11 have been assigned to the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, and 40 have been assigned to the Chongqing Municipal Government. Hunan and Hubei provinces will organize social education work groups to carry out wartime social education, while the remaining provinces will assign them to social education institutions to serve or take on administrative work. The living expenses of the registered personnel will be paid monthly by the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Guangxi Medical College Established, Opens on October 1</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Nanning Military Medical School, originally the Guangxi Provincial Medical College, was established in 1934. Later, in response to military needs, it was changed to the Guangxi Military Medical School in 1937. This year, due to the central government's adjustment and improvement of military health facilities, the Garrison Headquarters decided to transfer the school to the provincial government. The Education Department believes that in order to improve the health of the people, medical and health personnel should be cultivated as much as possible. Therefore, it was decided to change the Military Medical School to the Guangxi Medical College and attach a training class for health technicians. The Nanning Provincial Hospital is also affiliated with the college. The college is scheduled to open on October 1. In the next month, professors will be supplemented and students' levels will be adjusted. As for the current graduating students, they have been transferred to hospitals in Nanning, Baise, and Guilin for internship.</p>

<h3>Charity Tennis Tournament Successfully Concludes Yesterday; Revenue Reaches Over 3,700 Yuan; Tao Maozi Wins Men's Singles Championship</h3>
<p>The unprecedentedly grand charity tennis tournament concluded successfully yesterday. Yesterday's program was even more exciting than the first day, so more guests were crowded in. Three velvet balls sold at auction for 500 yuan to Mr. Shao Liangeng. The total revenue for the two days reached a huge 3,731 yuan, all of which was donated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, benefiting countless starving refugees. The results of yesterday's performance are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's performance focused on the finals of the McCague men's singles and doubles championships. McCague's tennis skills are really above the amateur level, so the game was extremely exciting. In the singles final between Tao Maozi and Cai Houfa, both sides had excellent forehands and backhands, and the serve was very sharp. Cai's work at the net was truly a masterpiece, while Tao excelled in side-spin shots. The McCague men's singles was a best-of-five-sets system, while the doubles final was a best-of-three-sets system. After the game, Mrs. Shi Zhaoji and Mrs. Chen Da presented the awards amidst warm applause. Yesterday's performance also included two doubles matches, both between young and handsome players. First, Chen Hongguo and Xu Peizhi played against the two Cais, who were particularly agile and experienced.

<h3>Two Victories for Tung Wah and Lido: Tung Wah Wins 3-0 Against French Commerce, Lido Defeats Portuguese 4-1</h3>
<p>Yesterday, being Sunday, there were as many as three friendly football matches. In the morning, St. Francis of Yih Yuen was unexpectedly defeated by Tung Sai Lai with a huge score of two to eight. This was followed by Tung Wah versus French Commerce. French Commerce is not what it used to be; many famous players have scattered. Although there are one or two people supporting the remnants, it ultimately feels like a single tree is hard to support. Only the shell remains. Tung Wah won very easily, with the first half ending three to zero, and the final score remaining the same. In the afternoon, Lido played against Portugal at Aurora University. The Portuguese lineup was not much different from when they attended the International Cup last year. Lido ultimately defeated them heavily with a score of four to one, and the only goal scored by Portuguese Commerce was just a penalty kick.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Easily　Defeats French Commerce Yesterday</p>
<p>French Commerce's little blonde haired Robert Stoff was absent yesterday, resulting in only Jem Watt supporting the front line alone. Although the defense consisted of veterans such as Bowser Zhong and Cole, they ultimately lacked coordination, making it difficult to manage, leading to all offensive opportunities belonging to Tung Wah. French Commerce is not what it used to be, having declined drastically since Bowser Hugh returned to his country, Newburg passed away from illness, and Parker retired due to nationality issues. After the start of the match, Dai Lingjing scored a goal within minutes, but it was not counted due to offside. At sixteen minutes, Avanche crossed, and A Dai scored with a header, making it one to zero. At twenty-four minutes, Dai and Jia rushed in together, Jia fell, and Dai succeeded, making it two to zero. At thirty minutes, Youliang cut in, and Yu Qiaxing scored from the crowd with one kick, making it three to zero. The first half ended. After adjusting the lineup in the second half, French Commerce's offensive was slightly better than in the first half, but their shooting was lacking, and nothing came of it. Only Jem Watt's flat shot, which Qin Bigao saved into a corner kick, was relatively exciting. Tung Wah ultimately ended the game with the three to zero lead created in the first half.</p>

<p>Lido Easily　Defeats Portugal</p>
<p>In the match between Lido and Portuguese Commerce, Portuguese Commerce went all out to fight, only missing Massanier, Favan Laugh, and Cora Sha. Portuguese Commerce kicked off and attacked first, with Lopos shooting, going over the crossbar. Lido counterattacked, with Xu Wenkui attacking twice, but both times went wide. Lido was warned again, and escaped safely. At fourteen minutes, Qiu Ting crossed, Kehou chipped the ball, and Su Ruo blocked it, but A Kui rushed up and made the final push, (one to zero). After two minutes, Zhang Lingen fouled, and Su Ruo took the penalty kick twice before succeeding, tying the score. At twenty minutes, Portuguese Commerce's left back committed a handball in the penalty area, another penalty kick, and Xu Wenkui scored with one kick, (two to one). One minute later, Wu Qixiang passed, A Sun chipped the ball, and Xu Wenkui hit the target, (three to one). After halftime, both sides made major changes. Xu Wenkui and Huang Kehou retired together. After the changes in Portuguese Commerce's lineup, their strength decreased. Lido attacked repeatedly, but Sun Jinshun's luck was not good, and all shots hit the post. Jiang Chao missed many good opportunities, but after Li Yichen was transferred to center forward, he succeeded greatly at fifteen minutes. When the final whistle blew, Lido won a great victory with four to one.</p>

<h3>How to Stabilize Wartime Food Supplies</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezhang</p>
<p>One lesson learned from the First World War is that the effectiveness of food in wartime is no less than that of artillery fire on the front lines; because during the war, millions of troops must be mobilized, and the supply of food must be as adequate as possible. Otherwise, how can soldiers have the strength to fight a protracted war if they are hungry? On the other hand, food is the most important necessity of life for the people. If there is a shortage of food and everyone is hungry, social unrest will occur, thus hindering military operations. In the previous World War, how elite were the German army, navy, and air force, and how abundant were their military supplies; but behind them, the people felt a lack of food. By 1918, even military food became difficult, resulting in defeat!</p>
<p>From the beginning of this European war to the present, it has not been long, and countries have already begun to control food. Germany has implemented food rationing, and since September 9, a flour allocation system has been implemented, with a limit of five pounds of flour per person per week. The French government has promulgated and implemented wartime civil food relief regulations. The United Kingdom will issue 80 million food crude certificates... Children under the age of six can enjoy half the adult ration (this is a Haidong telegram on the 15th; but according to an Associated Press dispatch on the 9th, the British government will implement food control within three or four weeks. The United Kingdom has a lot of food stored, but salted meat and butter may be temporarily in short supply due to transportation difficulties). As for Italy, which is currently neutral, the Italian government has promulgated wartime economic emergency regulations, regarding food: prohibiting the sale of wine and coffee; limiting each person to one ounce of baked bread per day, and no meat on two days a week; restaurants are limited to one meat and one fish per meal. It can be seen how important food is in wartime.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese government promulgated the Wartime Food Management Regulations on August 18, 1937, of which Article 4 stipulates management matters: (1) production; (2) consumption; (3) storage; (4) price; (5) transportation and trade; (6) control and distribution. Since the promulgation of this regulation, food transportation and sales agencies have been established in various provinces, cities, and counties, and food warehouses have been widely established in the interior and adjacent war zone areas. For example, the Sichuan Agricultural Capital Bureau and the Sichuan Provincial Bank are currently planning to purchase large quantities of food and establish simple granaries so that farmers can mortgage their rice and grain at high prices. This measure is intended to prevent food shortages for the people on the one hand, and increase farmers' income on the other hand.</p>
<p>There are no statistics on China's food production situation after the war; but according to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry before the war, the average yield from 1931 to 1935 was: an average of 1,026,011,000 shi dan of rice in 22 provinces across the country over five years; 446,339,000 shi dan of wheat; and 1,089,462,000 shi dan of miscellaneous grains, totaling 2,629,368 shi dan. In terms of percentage, rice accounts for 36 percent; wheat accounts for 17 percent; and miscellaneous grains account for 47 percent. Then, based on the population and food composition of each province and the consumption of each type of food per person per year, the consumption volume is estimated. The calculated supply and demand differences are recorded below: (1) Rice - the national production volume is 1,026,011,000 shi dan, the actual consumption volume is 959,872,000 shi dan, with a surplus of 66,139,000 shi dan. (2) Wheat - the national production volume is 46,339,000 shi dan, the actual consumption volume is 462,435,000 shi dan, with a deficit of 16,096,000 shi dan. (3) Miscellaneous grains - the national production volume is 1,089,462,000 shi dan, the actual consumption volume is 887,912,000 shi dan, with a surplus of 201,550,000 shi dan. According to this statistic, there is still a surplus of 261,593,000 shi dan in the total amount of food; however, the actual consumption volume estimated in this figure only refers to food for human consumption, and does not include livestock feed seeds and other uses.</p>
<p>In fact, the total amount of food consumed in China each year is quite a lot. According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, of the rice produced in the 22 provinces of the interior, 82 percent is for human consumption, 8 percent is for seeds, 4 percent is for livestock feed, and 6 percent is for other uses. Of the wheat, 74 percent is for human consumption, 11 percent is for seeds, 5 percent is for livestock feed, and 10 percent is for other uses. Other miscellaneous grains have a small percentage for human consumption, and a large percentage for livestock feed and other uses. From this point of view, China's food production cannot supply all aspects of consumption without a surplus, but rather a shortage.</p>
<p>The decline in food production during wartime is a common fact, because the majority of strong men in rural areas are conscripted into the army and absorbed by war industries, the conscription of horses, the consumption of livestock, the conversion of farmland into battlefields, etc., lead to a significant decrease in food production. Looking at the last World War, although the people of the warring countries were very enthusiastic about farming, the area sown did decrease in fact. At the same time, it is also a common fact that food cannot be imported as smoothly as in peacetime during wartime. If it is in a state of blockade, the difficulty of importing is very great. Speaking of China, the main food materials of rice and wheat are more than enough to supply human consumption in peacetime; however, when added to livestock and other uses, there is a shortage. This shortage will naturally be felt even more due to the reduction in wartime production. Therefore, it is imperative to strive to increase food production during wartime. The Outline of the Implementation Measures for Refugee Reclamation promulgated by the Executive Yuan on March 3, 1938, is indeed a concrete measure to increase production. After the war, provinces in the interior such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi have greatly increased the production of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains after the government encouraged the planting of food. This year, due to favorable rainfall and improvements in planting methods, food can be harvested again. Therefore, although China's wartime food supply is felt to be insufficient, it is certainly not as serious as generally imagined. If control policies can be effectively implemented, people will automatically save on consumption, and if necessary, a quantitative distribution will be enforced. There is no shortage of precedents for all of this in various countries. For rice and wheat, which are in greater shortage, in addition to restricting improper consumption, miscellaneous grains should be used as substitutes as much as possible in consumption. It should be known that China has an excess supply of miscellaneous grains and livestock meat and egg products, etc., and there are large exports in peacetime. Wartime export difficulties can regulate surplus and deficiency. In this way, China's wartime food self-sufficiency is very possible.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for China's lack of food is improper consumption, with the consumption of refined white rice and winemaking being the largest.</p>
<p>The Chinese love to eat refined white rice, which not only wastes food, but is also not in line with hygiene. Before the war, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Industrial Products Inspection Institute used chemical analysis methods to inspect brown rice and white rice, and the results showed that the protein and fat content of refined white rice was less than that of brown rice, with the No. 1 Changshu white rice being the least. However, Shanghai people like to eat Changshu No. 1 white glutinous rice the most, and there are still many people who buy No. 1 white glutinous rice for 40 yuan. Regarding the loss of milling brown rice into refined white rice, according to statistics from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, each stone loses two dou four sheng six he (in fact, each stone of milled No. 1 white glutinous rice loses three dou), which is equal to 40% of the consumption of refined white rice. Now, assuming that the annual consumption of refined white rice is 100 million shi, the loss of food rice calculated at two dou five sheng per shi is 25 million shi, which can be used as food for eight or nine million people for one year. Such a huge loss is really uneconomical. Someone estimates that 5% or 6% of domestic rice and wheat are used for winemaking, and the quantity is more than 30 million shi; 15% of barley is used for brewing. Someone else estimates that the annual consumption of grains for winemaking is about 60 million shi; the annual consumption of wheat and barley for winemaking is 10 million shi; and 23% of sorghum production is used for winemaking. As for sugar production and feed, there are no statistics yet. Just looking at the existing numbers, it can be seen that China's food waste is simply appalling. In view of this, the Chinese government has repeatedly ordered local authorities in various provinces to restrict the brewing of wine from major food crops. But on the other hand, it also requires the people of the whole country to appeal to moral self-discipline, eat brown rice as much as possible, use miscellaneous grains as substitutes, and avoid all unnecessary consumption of food.</p>
<p>In addition, under the principle of control, at least one point of preventing speculation must be effectively achieved. During wartime, commodity prices fluctuate too much, which often leads to general speculative behavior; because of this speculative behavior, it stimulates a kind of untrue supply and demand situation, making commodity price fluctuations even more chaotic. To stabilize commodity prices and make supply and demand correspond, it is necessary to prevent speculative behavior and eliminate the untrue supply and demand phenomenon in the market. The so-called speculative behavior does not only refer to speculation in the exchange, such as individuals storing food beyond their own needs, and food merchants engaging in activities that exceed market needs, including speculation.</p>
<p>At present, this kind of speculative phenomenon is most obvious in Shanghai. Not to mention other commodity prices, just look at the price of rice, which has risen to such a degree that people are living in dire straits! In the present situation where the Chinese government's whip is beyond its reach, it is not an easy task to stabilize commodity prices and make supply and demand correspond. At this juncture, we can only hope that the concession authorities will do their best to curb the continued rise in commodity prices on the one hand, and try to find ways to dredge up sources on the other hand. As for the speculators themselves, they should be aware of the suffering of the masses, and should never take the opportunity to seek personal gain because of the urgent needs of others, which is the so-called immoral "war profiteering." The citizens themselves must have a spirit of solidarity and mutual cooperation. During the previous World War, as the prices of war-time bread and other foodstuffs gradually rose in France and the people's lives became increasingly difficult, consumer cooperatives were established in various places to supply bread and other foodstuffs at low prices. This is a precedent that can be emulated. Citizens may wish to organize neighborhood consumer cooperatives with each alley as a unit to sell daily necessities at low prices. Please give guidance from the authorities on the methods of organization, etc. At the same time, citizens should save as much as possible. The London War Economy Committee in the United Kingdom distributed the following leaflets to various restaurants during the previous World War: "Do not waste bread. If half a slice is enough, cut the whole slice into thin slices to eat. It is the duty of the people to work together to save bread." At this time, citizens should carefully consider these words!</p>

<p>First, let's talk about the highways in the northwestern provinces: the highways completed in Shaanxi and Xinjiang provinces are no less than several thousand kilometers; such as the highway from Kulun through Yamatai, Huo Dassen, Shabuke, Nandian, and into Ningxia Province, from Ningxia through Weiyuan and further south to Jiuquan, Gansu Province: it has long been completed. The Suixin Highway from Suiyuan through Mongolia to Xinjiang has also been opened to traffic.</p>
<p>As for the highway construction in the southwestern provinces, it is more developed than in the northwest. According to a survey, the total length of the highways that have been completed in the southwestern provinces is more than 27,000 kilometers. There are also more than 20,000 kilometers under active construction and planning. The trunk lines connecting the provinces include: Gan-Dian, Chuan-Gui, Gui-Min, Xiang-Gui, Chuan-Xiang, Chuan-Dian, Xiang-E, Gui-Dian, Chuan-E, Xiang-Qian, Dian-Qian, and Chuan-Qian. In addition, each province also has construction plans for its own provincial highway system. Taking Guizhou Province as an example: the province is currently rushing to build the following ten trunk roads: (1) Chi-Wei section of the Chuan-Dian Road (recently opened to traffic), (2) Xing-Ren Road (from Xingren and Xingyi to Kunming), (3) An-Du Road (from Anlong through Baise, Guangxi to Longzhou). The above are the highways connecting the province to neighboring provinces. As for the highways between counties, there are: (4) Yu-Song Road, (5) Ding-Luo Road, (6) Du-San Road, (7) Zun-Ping Road, (8) Zun-Song Road, (9) Sui-Rong Road, (10) Tong-Chi Road, etc.</p>
<p>In Yunnan, the highways planned to be built this year include: (1) Xuan-Zhao section (from Yiwei through Guizhou, Weining, and reaching Zhaotong, Sichuan), with a length of 295 kilometers. The Yiwei to Dian-Qian section has been completed. (2) Lu-Kai section (from Lunan to Kaiyuan) This section was completed in July. (3) Kai-Bo section (Kaiyuan to Boai via Yanshan) with a total length of 490 kilometers and 100 meters. The Kaiyuan to Yanshan section was completed in July. (4) Kai-Jie section (Kaiyuan to Jiejiu, 78 kilometers long), this section was opened to traffic in March. In addition, there are: (1) E-Xin section (Eshan to Xinping) 184 kilometers long. (2) Xin-Ning section (Xinping to Ning'er) 359 kilometers and 240 meters long. (3) Da-Li section (Dali to Lijiang) 180 kilometers and 6 meters long. (4) Wu-Yuan section (Wuding to Yuanmou), etc., are all under active construction. The highways between counties in the province that will soon be completed are: (1) Kunming to Fumin, (2) Xiangyun to Binchuan, (3) Binchuan to Yongsheng, etc. There are also: Guangfu, Guangbo, Yuxi, Heshi, Tonghai, Jiangchuan, Hua-Ning, etc., which are under planning and construction.</p>
<p>The government has now allocated 76 million yuan for improvement costs in order to increase the efficiency of highway traffic; of which 52 million yuan will be used to purchase new trucks, and 13 million yuan will be used to improve road surfaces. Under the government's construction and improvement of highways at any cost, the highway transportation capacity in the future will inevitably develop and strengthen day by day, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>C Aviation Before the war, China's airline routes included six major trunk lines, such as Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Ping, Shanghai-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shaanxi, Ping-Han, and Beijing-Yunnan; because they were all located along the coast and the Yangtze River ports, they were suspended after the outbreak of the war. Later, with the active promotion and assistance of the government, three major airlines, "China," "Eurasia," and "Southwest," have built (1) the Yu-Rong Line, which is 290 kilometers long; (2) the Yu-Kun Line, which is 788 kilometers long; (3) the Yu-Jia Line, which is 200 kilometers long; (4) the Chongqing-Hami Line, which is 2,700 kilometers long; (this line was officially opened to traffic in March), (5) the Shaan-Rong Line, which is 600 kilometers long; (6) the Rong-Kun Line, which is 700 kilometers long; (7) the Guangzhou Line, which is 406 kilometers long; (8) the Guangzhou-Yong Line, which is 551 kilometers long in total.</p>
<p>D Telecommunications In addition to the government's active construction of water, land, and air transportation, it is also making every effort to build wired and wireless telephone and telegraph networks in the country. Such as establishing a telegraph headquarters, expanding existing telegraph lines: increasing telephone lines, building telephone and telegraph communication networks in the southwest and northwest; and building wireless telegraph machine communication networks, increasing international direct wireless telegraph and telephone circuits. And build small wireless radio stations in important cities in various border provinces and in the Kunming-connected provinces, etc. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, long-distance thunder phones have been installed in 52 counties; the 29 counties that have not been installed will set up small wireless radio stations in the short-term counties, and long-distance telephones with various counties. It is estimated that the copper wire used in the province's telecommunications in the year of the Anti-Japanese War is equal to the copper wire used in the past 20 years. The rapid progress of telecommunications in the border provinces can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Because of the extensive development of transportation construction in the southwest and northwest, it can not only enable the smooth progress of China's economic, political, cultural, and other undertakings; but also make it easier to quickly concentrate forces in the military. The expansion of international transportation lines can break through the blockade and obtain more material and technical assistance from friendly countries. (The End)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Cash Off-Site Trading - Still Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market situation of cash foreign exchange was due to the weekly holiday, resulting in no formal market conditions. It is rumored that the off-site situation was still mediocre, and the trend was first firm and then tired. At the beginning, a transaction was made at 4,115 yuan, but later it became tired due to the sale of spot numbers and floating multiples. It once fell back to a low of 4,100 yuan, but at noon, a certain money exchange business still asked for 4,110 yuan for the selling price, and still returned 4,100 yuan for the buying price, with no great honor or disgrace compared to the last off-site price of the previous day. The selling price of gold bars in silver shops remained unchanged throughout, with both Datong Bank and Xintong Bank still hanging at 415 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan. As for the London telegram on the 10th and 20th, the price of British pure gold was still set at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce. No telegrams arrived for British, American, and Indian foreign silver.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices: Broken Japonica Rice Increases by Another Dollar; Top-Grade Regular Japonica Opens at Forty-Four Dollars; Sales of Newly Harvested Yanglu Pointed Rice Flourish in the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from various trading groups and river ports was coming to an end, and no shipments had arrived. Furthermore, the volume of new goods transported by rail from Kunshan, Suzhou, Fengxian, and Jiading was also sluggish, amounting to only about three thousand packages. With the scarcity of arrivals, the market sentiment remained stable. Moreover, as sales continued to be active in both urban and rural markets, the market remained firm. Prices for top-grade rice did not fluctuate, with all quotations following the original levels. Jiangbei new top-grade rice remained at twenty-three dollars, followed by twenty-two dollars. Wuhu top-grade rice was priced at twenty-three dollars and eighty cents and twenty-three dollars. Bangbu top-grade rice ranged from twenty-three dollars to twenty-one dollars and seventy cents. As for newly harvested Yanglu top-grade rice, due to its limited supply and popularity among stores, its quality was similar to that of Japonica rice. With the recent high price of Japonica rice, many consumers turned to this top-grade rice, making it a hot-selling item for stores, resulting in competitive purchasing and a market increase of about fifty cents. The quotations for newly harvested Yanglu top-grade rice from Kunshan, Suzhou, Fengxian, and Jiading were twenty-six dollars and fifty cents for the best quality, followed by twenty-five dollars and fifty cents. New Lu top-grade rice was priced at twenty-seven dollars and twenty cents, followed by twenty-six dollars. The prices of Japonica rice became even more attractive, increasing by about one dollar. Top-grade regular broken Japonica rice was priced at forty-three to forty-four dollars, medium quality at forty-one dollars, and top-grade Xixi broken rice at forty-two to forty-three dollars, medium quality at forty-one dollars and forty dollars. Broken Japonica rice from Suzhou, Tongzhou, and Kunshan ranged from forty-one dollars to forty dollars, new Japonica rice at thirty-nine dollars and thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents, Fengjing Baige at forty dollars, and early broken original packages at forty-one to forty-two dollars. Transformed rice also saw an increase, opening at thirty-four to thirty-five dollars, with over seven thousand packages traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's quotation was slightly tighter, with a rebound of thirty to fifty cents. Spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar were fifty-five dollars, re-export sugar at forty-two dollars, Taikoo granulated white B mark at fifty-eight dollars and seventy cents to fifty-nine dollars, CW mark at fifty-eight dollars and fifty cents, CX mark at fifty-eight dollars, DY mark at fifty-seven dollars and fifty cents, HX mark at fifty-seven dollars, H mark coarse red sugar at forty-three dollars and fifty cents, Dutch red sugar at forty-four dollars and fifty cents, and re-export at thirty-seven dollars. Local refined white sugar Zhenji No. 1 was fifty-six dollars, No. 2 at fifty-five dollars and fifty cents, No. 3 at fifty-five dollars, No. 4 at fifty-four dollars and fifty cents. Local No. 1 rock sugar was sixty-six dollars and fifty cents, Jingming rock sugar at fifty-eight dollars. There were a few transactions of domestically produced miscellaneous raw sugar at off-the-record prices, with little change in quoted prices compared to the previous day. It is expected that sales have not been strong recently and that larger sales will occur after the arrival of refined sugar.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Dust Arrives; Coal Balls Reduced by Two Dollars; Door-to-Door Sales at Four Dollars per Load</h3>
<p>The coal ball business had previously seen manufacturers hoarding raw materials due to concerns about shortages, leading to speculative off-the-record price increases. However, with the recent steady arrival of coal dust, market sentiment has stabilized, and sales have become sluggish. Major manufacturers with larger shipments have also shown signs of competition, resulting in lower domestic prices. A major manufacturer recently offered a price of only seventy-two dollars per ton, but after mediation between the two parties, a price of seventy-four dollars per ton was agreed upon for delivery, with an additional two dollars and fifty cents for transportation, which is two dollars lower than the previous week. Retail sales from door-to-door are ten dollars per basket and four dollars per load (one hundred market catties).</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Arrival of Orchid Seeds in Shanghai Awaits</h3>
<p>The orchid seed production season has long begun, but due to disrupted transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu, no shipments have arrived in Shanghai. Although transportation has now resumed, a certain party mistakenly believes that the goods are medicinal materials and intends to purchase them, which has not yet been resolved. Therefore, the shipment to Shanghai is still pending, and a large shipment may be loaded within this week.</p>
<p>The above diagram compares the potential wartime supply of important raw materials for the seven major powers: the United States, Germany, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan. The "Potential Wartime Increase in Production" includes the supply from territories and the use of substitutes. This diagram was investigated by the International Research Department of Harvard University in the United States and published in Mr. Ainam's book "The Strategy of Raw Materials." The most obvious fact in the diagram is that the United States and the Soviet Union have the most widespread and abundant supply capacity, while Britain and France have the support of their colonies. Japan's poor resource capacity is most tragic, which is undoubtedly a fatal flaw in its war against China.</p>

<h3>Motley Crew Appears; Situation in Western Shanghai Becomes More Chaotic; Residents Relocate to Leave This Unsafe Land; Puppet Officials Attempt to Collect Stall Fees Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the area of the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads, the intrusion of puppet police has greatly damaged the police authority of the concessions. Due to the complexity of the situation in the area, the situation has become increasingly chaotic until yesterday. In the Caojiadu and Bailinan Road areas, in addition to the puppet police, there are also armed forces of various origins active. A so-called "Shanghai Special City Western Shanghai Caojiadu Self-Defense Corps" has occupied school buildings, openly set up posts, and the puppet police began collecting taxes in the area yesterday. The general residents, filled with fear, have mostly relocated to safer places, resulting in a sharp increase in vacant houses. The following is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Certain Bandits Take the Opportunity to Become Active</p>
<p>The members of a certain organization entrenched in the former Cao Yi Elementary School were once disarmed by Italian troops. After being released, although they still stayed in the building, they usually kept the main gate tightly closed and entered and exited through the back door, without making any noise, until now. Recently, as the situation in western Shanghai has gradually changed, they have become active again. The long-closed main gate has been reopened. They all wear grass-green shorts, with inconsistent upper garments. They all carry pistols or Mauser pistols around their waists, moving in and out frequently in groups of twos and threes. The puppet police and patrolmen no longer interfere with them. In addition, there are also "hoodlums" wearing Western suits, also carrying weapons around their waists, scattered on various roads, often appearing in gambling dens and opium dens. The residents in the area are very afraid of their actions.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Imitate; Organize Self-Defense Corps</p>
<p>At the same time, the former Cao Nan Elementary School at 93 Lusuezhai Road, Bailinan Road, was suddenly occupied yesterday morning by the so-called "Shanghai Special City Western Shanghai Caojiadu Self-Defense Corps," which hung up a wooden sign and sent out "corps members" to set up posts and guard. It is said that they are supported by the Japanese puppets and have obtained full armament, so they began to operate. The leader is named Hu Deshan, and the entire "corps" has about one hundred members, mostly unemployed vagrants. The uniforms they wear are grass-green, with cloth leggings, black cloth shoes, and military caps, with a five-pointed star-shaped cap badge with five colors of red, yellow, blue, white, and black in the center, and cloth shoulder straps with black numerals. All the "corps members" are issued rifles by the Japanese puppets and claim that they are implementing "self-defense" because the concessions are unable to protect the residents of Caojiadu. In addition, some party members are stationed in a part of the Gan Gong Elementary School at 121 Bailinan Road, also with weapons. Their uniforms are grass-yellow, with round military caps, with a white sun in a blue sky emblem in the center, clearly different from the so-called "self-defense corps members."</p>
<p>Forced Taxation; Residents Relocate One After Another</p>
<p>Residents and merchants in the extra-settlement roads area have been paying taxes to the Municipal Council. However, the puppet authorities recently notified the residents that starting from October 1, taxes must be collected by the puppet "Finance Bureau." Although the Municipal Council has not yet made any statement on this, the puppet authorities began to forcibly collect general taxes in the area starting yesterday. Yesterday morning, at the time of the morning market, two plainclothes puppet officials, together with two armed puppet police, went to the vegetable stalls in the small vegetable market behind Qianjianong, Yuyuan Road, and forced them to pay the signboard tax, ranging from twenty cents to several dimes per person. The residents of the area have been deeply disturbed recently and have relocated one after another, so that houses that used to be difficult to rent at high prices in the Yuyuan Road area are now being offered by landlords at the lowest prices, but no one cares. Rent notices are posted all over the alley entrances and on various utility poles, which is a rare phenomenon since the Shanghai war. As for the detectives of the police station, whether patrolling or setting up posts, they must be in groups of three or five to prevent attacks by thugs. The change in the situation can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Village Still Relatively Quiet</p>
<p>Since the "Da Dao Police" entered the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads to patrol and set up posts, many days have passed. The Municipal Council has not yet taken any appropriate measures to deal with it, but only notified the police officers stationed in the area to pay attention. Fortunately, no accidents have occurred in the past few days. Yuyuan Road and Jessfield Road are the thoroughfares to Caojiadu, and pedestrians are still bustling, no less than before. Even the tourists in Zhaofeng Park are still endless, enjoying the autumn scenery. The residents of Zhaofeng Village next to it are also living in peace as usual.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Express Being Forced to Do This</p>
<p>Although the Western Shanghai area has been invaded and stationed by puppet police, the detectives of the concession police station are still stationed and patrolling as usual. In some sections, the number of personnel has even been increased to strengthen the force. If any incidents hindering the peace occur in these areas, the police station will still exercise police authority as usual, and the puppet police on duty will not interfere. However, enforcement has become difficult in some sections. A reporter from Da Guang News Agency spoke with the puppet police yesterday and was told that most of them were soldiers captured in battle or police officers from the former Public Security Bureau, who were forced to do this against their will. As for treatment, they only receive a salary of sixteen dollars per month, with self-provided meals. Not only is life painful, but they are also mentally disturbed. They feel ashamed to be stationed here and can only endure humiliation due to circumstances. Their words seemed to be filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Report Puppet Government's Attempt</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (30th), it was heard from responsible parties that the Jiangwan Shanghai Special City Government will start today (1st) to collect "municipal donations" from Chinese and foreign residents in the outer roads of the Western District, because the new municipal government recognizes the outer roads of the Western District as part of the Chinese territory. Officials of the Finance Bureau of the new municipal government recently confirmed the Chinese rumors that the new municipal government will take this action, and explained that foreigners residing in the area must also pay taxes, and that the taxes collected are only for winter municipal donations. These words indicate that they will also collect donations for another quarter of this year. It was also announced that the "municipal donation" is 11% of the rent for shops and 9% for residents.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Sets Up Department to Handle; Central China Police Affairs; Manage Police Affairs of Consulates in Yangtze River Basin</h3>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing the increasing number of people migrating to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the increasing complexity of police affairs at Japanese consulates, established the "Central China Police Department of the Japanese Embassy in China" in Shanghai yesterday to guide and supervise Japanese consulates and police stations in the lower Yangtze River and nearby areas. Embassy Councilor Miura Yoshiaki will serve as the director, and the department will be divided into three sections. The first section will be headed by Consul Hattori Tsuneo, in charge of personnel and police system matters. The second section will be headed by Consul Ogawa Kiichi, in charge of ideology, labor, social movements, publishing, communications, meetings, elections, religion, education, and other matters. The third section will be headed concurrently by Hattori Tsuneo, in charge of judicial affairs, business, transportation, customs, hygiene, coastal defense, household registration, investigation, and supervision of residents.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander; Hottle to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; Will Stay in Shanghai for Several Days; To Maintain Contact with Relevant Authorities</h3>
<p>The US flagship Augusta, which has been patrolling the North China Sea for more than a month, is scheduled to sail to Shanghai from Qingdao tomorrow. US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hottle will also return to Shanghai on the flagship. Hottle's personal yacht Isabel will also return to Shanghai with him. Hottle will stay in Shanghai for several days to maintain contact with relevant authorities. It is rumored that the Shanghai Defense Vehicle Small Group will hold another meeting to discuss proposals, and it is possible that Hottle will advise on the proposals discussed by the group. The US Asiatic Fleet Marblehead is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 4th and sail north for routine patrol work after the Augusta arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Nishio and Itagaki Arrive in Shanghai; Hold Meetings for Days to Discuss Aggression Plans; Chinese Side Prepares to Deal a Severe Blow</h3>
<p>General Nishio, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of Central China by the Japanese authorities, and General Itagaki, the former Minister of the Army who was reassigned as the chief of staff of the Central China Command, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of September 29, one after the other. However, Japanese newspapers have kept this news secret and have not disclosed it, intending to prevent the Chinese side from paying attention and making more resolute preparations for military resistance. Details have been obtained from a certain related party as follows:</p>
<p>Nishio and Itagaki Arrive in Shanghai on the Same Day</p>
<p>After General Nishio officially accepted the new position as commander-in-chief of Central China from the Japanese government, he took a special round trip on the Nagasaki Maru of the Nisshin Company from Japan and arrived in Shanghai at 4:45 p.m. on September 29. The ship docked at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou. After Nishio disembarked, he took a pre-arranged car under the strict guard of the Japanese naval and military police directly to General Itagaki, the commander of the Japanese army on Disui Road. General Itagaki also arrived at the Shanghai Dachang Airport by plane from Japan at 2:30 p.m. on the same afternoon and, under the protection of the Japanese army, took a car directly to the Japanese military attaché's residence to rest, and then met with Nishio. That evening, they went to a banquet held by the Japanese and puppet sides.</p>
<p>Heavy Guard; Japanese Puppets Welcome</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Japanese organization received a telegram from Tokyo on the morning of September 29 from the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Army Command, informing them of the date and time of the arrival of Generals Nishio and Itagaki, they, together with the Japanese naval, army, and military police stationed in Shanghai, were deployed around the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou, prohibiting passing pedestrians and taking extremely strict precautions. From the wharf to the Japanese Army Command, Japanese troops were secretly deployed along the way. In addition to the Japanese consul and representatives of the Japanese navy, army, and military police, those who went to the wharf to welcome them included the puppet "mayor" Chuan Xiao'an, the puppet police chief Lu Ying, representatives of a certain faction, Yi Zanren and Chen Nongfu, as well as representatives of the Fuyi Association and the Damin Association.</p>
<p>Major Battles Will Soon Break Out on All Fronts Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Regarding the arrival of Nishio and Itagaki in Shanghai, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai have kept this news secret and have not disclosed it, intending to prevent the Chinese side from paying attention and making more resolute preparations for military resistance. This is especially worthy of the Chinese people's attention. According to unofficial sources, Nishio and Itagaki have been secretly meeting with Japanese officials in Shanghai for days. As soon as an important decision is made, they will rush to inspect the front lines and will soon supervise the army to launch a major war against the Chinese army, as a final struggle. According to reports, the reason for the major war is that China has no hope for peace with Japan and still holds the belief of resisting to the end.</p>
<p>Nishio Leaves Shanghai; Flies to Nanjing</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that General Nishio, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in China, and his chief of staff, Itagaki, the former Japanese Minister of the Army, arrived in Shanghai one after the other on Friday afternoon. They stayed in the city center overnight and left Shanghai at 12:30 p.m. yesterday (30th) and flew to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Yanagawa Makes a Speech; Induces Economic Cooperation; Says Japan Does Not Want to Control Economic Hegemony; But Chinese Have No Desire to Cooperate</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Lieutenant General Yanagawa, the Director-General of the Japanese Asia Development Board, recently stated at a reception for newspaper reporters at the Central China Liaison Office of the Board that Japan would not refuse people from third countries to participate in Japanese enterprises in China, and that Chinese people participating in Japanese enterprises would also be welcomed. Some Chinese capitalists in the Japanese-occupied areas still do not want to cooperate with the Japanese, and also refuse to negotiate with those who seek</p>
<p>This Kind of Cooperation</p>
<p>and discuss it with them. However, as peace and order in the occupied areas are being rapidly restored, they should consider the welfare of the Chinese people and help the revival of various industries. Some views believe that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is Japan's attempt to control</p>
<p>Economic Hegemony</p>
<p>However, Japan not only has no such intention, but also welcomes the return of Chinese capital to Japanese-occupied areas. Japan will also not refuse people from third countries to participate in Japanese enterprises. The establishment of the Japanese Army Command in China and the establishment of a new central government by Wang Jingwei will not</p>
<p>Affect Existing Plans</p>
<p>of the Asia Development Board. According to reports, Lieutenant General Yanagawa is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen by ship at 9:00 a.m. today. According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, Yanagawa visited the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, Vice Admiral Oikawa, in Shanghai, and also sent representatives to visit the heads of the Shanghai Special City Government and officers of the Japanese Defense Force.</p>
<h3>Although the Japanese Shipping Company is Established; It is Meaningless; Attempts to Manipulate East Asian Shipping; Japanese Companies Are All Superficially Compliant</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity of the European war, the Japanese government attempted to complete the manipulation of all shipping on the so-called "East Asian" seas. After exerting great pressure on major Japanese shipping companies, the "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." was created, which was officially announced yesterday at the original site of the former Japanese Nisshin Company at 20 Guangdong Road. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Merger Process</p>
<p>The Japanese government in Tokyo issued an order for implementation of the merger on the first day of last month to reorganize major Japanese shipping companies. The companies that received this order at that time included Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Yamashita Kisen, and Dalian Kisen. Nisshin Kisen was the first to express its obedience. Later, Osaka Shosen also joined after Nisshin Kisen. However, NYK, due to its global routes, and Yamashita Kisen, due to its tramp steamers, and Dalian Kisen, citing its specialized service to Dalian in North China, were slow to agree to cooperate. After repeated negotiations between the Japanese government and the companies, NYK finally agreed to partially cede several ships between China and Japan to participate. The global routes still retained the NYK name and were independent in nature. Yamashita Kisen fully accepted, while Dalian Kisen did not join for the time being. Therefore, the so-called "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." was formed by integrating Nisshin Kisen, Osaka Shosen, Yamashita Kisen, and part of NYK.</p>
<p>Shipping Routes and Vessels</p>
<p>According to investigations, the shipping routes and vessels of each company participating in the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. are as follows: NYK is participating with five vessels, including the passenger ships Nagasaki Maru and Shanghai Maru between Nagasaki and Shanghai, and the cargo ships Myoken Maru, Myogi Maru, and Myosei Maru. Nisshin Kisen is participating with about 20 vessels, including all of its Yangtze River routes, such as the Daikichi Maru, Kayang Maru, and Anxing Maru (formerly newspaper merchant ships). Osaka Shosen is participating with the Fujian Maru and Changsha Maru on the Sino-Japanese route, as well as several ships on the South China route. Yamashita Kisen is entirely tramp steamers, numbering up to ten, but its routes also extend to the South Seas Islands. Therefore, the East Asian shipping lines that the Japanese government plans to manipulate include the Sino-Japanese line, the South China line, the Yangtze River line, and the South Seas line. The North China line has not yet been successfully joined. According to general observations, although its ambitions are high, it is difficult to achieve its intended purpose due to the lack of ships. As for the person who controls the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., it is still Mr. Katsuto (transliteration), the general manager of Nisshin Kisen.</p>
<h3>Residents North of Suzhou Creek; Suffer Unbearable Harassment; Household Registration Survey Scheduled to Begin on the 11th; Forced Inoculations; Residence Used as a Threat</h3>
<p>In District A, north of Suzhou Creek, the Japanese side has been forcing local residents to get vaccinations. The deadline was originally set for the end of last month, but because many people refused to get vaccinated, the Japanese side had no choice but to extend the vaccination period. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Refusal to Get Vaccinated; Extension Announced</p>
<p>The vaccination site set up by the Japanese side in a tent next to the Shanghai Electric Power Company on the side of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, under the name of the "3rd Group of the Shanbei Luren Hospital Mobile Team," was re-posted yesterday with a notice announcing that the vaccination period would be extended for ten days, until October 10. Therefore, the forced vaccination work continued in the tent yesterday morning. After the Huisi Police Station sent Chinese and Western police to maintain order, the situation completely changed, and the previous chaotic scene was swept away.</p>
<p>Threatening Language in the Notice</p>
<p>According to a resident in the area who spoke to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Japanese side has also extended the deadline for the household registration survey in the area to begin on the 11th of this month. At that time, residents must present a vaccination certificate and then exchange for a pass before they are allowed to reside in the area. It was also found that the so-called "Luren Hospital" issued a notice containing serious language such as "If you do not get vaccinated by the deadline, you will be absolutely prohibited from passing through the North Henan Road and Haining Road area."</p>
<p>Residents Uneasy; Relocations Frequent</p>
<p>In view of the above situation, the Japanese side will impose various inconveniences and restrictions on residents in the area. However, it is unclear whether the restricted areas are only the North Henan Road and Haining Road area or include other side roads east of North Henan Road. As a result, the residents in the area have been quite uneasy, and many have relocated to the north of North Henan Road or south of Suzhou Creek. The rental notices posted in various alleys in the area are particularly numerous.</p>
<p>Defense Situation in Various Sections of District A</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side took over the defense of the area, there are still sentries stationed at the southern entrances of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. At the two blocked gaps in North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road, and Wenshi Road, there are two Japanese soldiers stationed at each post. Those passing through the gaps must show their passes. The North Henan Road area is generally guarded by British troops, and the police officers of the Huisi Police Station also patrol as usual.</p>
<p>The Inside of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is Extremely Filthy</p>
<p>Since the "Da Dao Municipal Government" occupied the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the north end of Tianhougong Bridge, its corridors and courtyards have become extremely filthy. The so-called "Da Dao Police" are stationed in the outhouses under the corridors, occupying a small team in total. They have all been disarmed, and the unarmed police guarding the entrance and the "issuing passes" office are their accomplices and have not been recently transferred from outside.</p>
<h3>Rumors of the Puppet Government Taking Over the Courts; Recurrence; The Attitude of the Diplomatic Corps Remains the Same; Firmly Refusing the Request</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that rumors that the Nanjing puppet "Reformed Government" will soon take over the Chinese courts in Shanghai resurfaced last night (30th). A message from the Japanese side said that, according to "well-informed sources," the two courts will be headed by a former chief judge who was recently dismissed by the National Government. In addition to the chief judge, officials of the puppet regime have already selected "qualified" candidates to fill various positions. A sub-headquarters of the "Ministry of Justice" has been established in Hongkou to be responsible for the takeover of the courts. Regarding the special zone courts, the puppet government has repeatedly made requests to the consular corps here, but they have all been rejected. Last spring, when rumors spread that the puppet "municipal government" would use force to take over the courts, the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai added armed guards to all the buildings of the courts.</p>
<h3>Passengers with Tickets for the Deping Cannot Board the Ship</h3>
<p>Since the plan to shorten the voyage of the Shanghai-Ningbo line failed to materialize, the Moufu ship stopped taking time off to return to Shanghai, so passengers switched to purchasing tickets for the Deping ship. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Zhenhai on the 29th, but due to the time required for loading cargo, it was changed to 4:00 p.m. on the 30th. However, when it was about to depart, it was discovered that some passengers who had not purchased tickets had boarded the ship without permission and insisted on traveling. However, hundreds of passengers who had purchased tickets were unable to board the ship due to extreme crowding. Although the shipping company sent people to persuade the passengers who had boarded without tickets, it was unsuccessful. Therefore, the ship left yesterday morning, but many passengers who had purchased tickets were left stranded on the shore, in a miserable situation.</p>
<h3>Number of Relief Provided by Charity Groups; Restricted</h3>

The remaining refugee maternity hospitals and the first and second shelters are not restricted for the time being.</p>
<h3>Strict Inland Prevention of the Export of Legal Tender: Attempting to Buy Foreign Exchange in Shanghai; Promulgation of Laws Forbidding Smuggling; Inspection of Aircraft Carrying Items</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the unnecessary outflow of legal tender, the Ministry of Finance has, in addition to strictly restricting remittances of foreign exchange from the mainland, promulgated laws prohibiting the export of legal tender, with the aim of preventing the smuggling of legal tender out of the country to purchase foreign exchange in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and other places. The following specific measures are now prescribed, telegraphed to all provinces for earnest and strict inspection and suppression: (1) Regardless of any public or private institution, the transport of all items out of the country by commercial aircraft must first obtain approval and a certificate from the Military Affairs Commission before being allowed to proceed, and the inspection authorities shall be responsible for inspection; (2) Passengers' luggage on aircraft and passengers' luggage and packages on vehicles shall, except for diplomatic personnel of friendly nations who shall be handled in accordance with international practice, be subject to inspection by the inspection authorities; (3) All items carried by airlines, motor transport agencies, and other personnel shall be handled in accordance with the above; (4) The entrances, exits, and passages of aircraft and vehicles shall be strictly designed by the inspection authorities to eliminate the abuses of bypassing and passing items; (5) The existing laws and regulations restricting the carrying of banknotes and the transportation of items that do not conflict with these measures shall remain in effect.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Raises Funds for Winter Clothing for the National Army: 200,000 Yuan in Lieu; Total Solicitation of Three Million Cotton Vests; Special Areas Allowed to Raise Funds in Lieu; Winter Clothing for Refugees Also Included in the Solicitation</h3>
<p>The National Winter Clothing Campaign Committee began its solicitation work on September 1 of this year. It is now learned that it has been decided to lead branches in various regions and charitable organizations in a large-scale promotion on this year's Double Tenth Festival, with the aim of collecting three million cotton vests by October 31 for distribution to soldiers fighting in the war, as well as soliciting used clothing for distribution to refugees.</p>
<p>Solicitation Target: Three Million Pieces</p>
<p>The goal of this year's winter clothing solicitation is to collect three million cotton vests. The National Winter Clothing Campaign Committee will continue to be the overall coordinating body, and the various branches and offices will be the implementing agencies for solicitation, sewing, and distribution. The number of items to be shouldered by each province and city will be determined according to their respective environmental and economic conditions, as follows: Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Chongqing, 200,000 pieces each; Fujian, 150,000 pieces; Hubei, Jiangxi, Xikang, Henan, and Gansu, 100,000 pieces each; Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces, 50,000 pieces each, totaling three million pieces.</p>
<p>Nanyang, Hong Kong, and Shanghai: Raising Funds in Lieu. In Nanyang, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places, either due to special circumstances or transportation issues, the focus will be limited to raising funds in lieu of winter clothing. The amount of funds to be shouldered has also been stipulated as follows: one million yuan from Nanyang and overseas Chinese, one hundred thousand yuan from Shanghai, and ten thousand yuan from Hong Kong. After raising the funds, appropriate locations with convenient transportation, materials, and labor in various provinces and cities will be selected for sewing and distribution, with one yuan and five jiao in national currency equivalent to one cotton vest. After sewing, the vests can be directly distributed by the branches to troops and new recruits, conscripts, and wounded soldiers in their respective provinces and cities or neighboring areas, but the total number and the unit numbers to which they are distributed must be notified to the headquarters before distribution to avoid duplication. Those who are unable to sew due to inconvenient material procurement or transportation can remit the collected funds to the headquarters for production and distribution, designating Xi'an, Yichang, Chongqing, Guilin, and Ji'an as centralized distribution locations for cotton vests.</p>
<p>Soliciting Used Clothing: Distributing to Refugees</p>
<p>The solicitation of used clothing for distribution to refugees includes all sizes, lengths, and types. Those who wish to donate cash in lieu of used clothing are also welcome and can hand them over to the local relief agencies under the Central Relief Committee for collection and forwarding. In areas where there are no agencies under the Relief Committee, the Winter Clothing Campaign Headquarters and its branches can be requested to collect and forward them on their behalf. The materials for cotton vests should primarily be sturdy, durable, and non-glossy coarse cloth, preferably in gray, but black, blue, and grass green are also acceptable. Each piece should be padded with no more than seven liang of cotton or coarse fleece.</p>
<h3>Ten-End Term: Absolutely No Concern; Money Shops Prepare Strictly; Industry and Commerce Cautious About Debts</h3>
<p>The Money Shops Association believes that as the Ten-End term approaches, the procedures for each member shop to prepare are not only related to external long-term loan settlement, but also internal capital preparation, which deserves especially close attention. Therefore, the Association has not only issued a notice to all member shops yesterday, setting the meeting for the regular meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM today at the Ningbo Road Association to discuss the interbank lending rates for September, but also scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month to discuss the Ten-End "internal market" rates and the reform of lending operations in each shop. It is understood that the forty-one member shops under the Money Shops Association, including Tongrun, Fuyuan, Hongsheng, Qingda, Anyu, and Fukang, primarily engage in credit lending. With the Ten-End loan settlement term approaching, each shop has begun preparations, and the collection and settlement will soon become busy. Various industries and businesses in this city have also taken precautions against this annual settlement hurdle and are actively preparing their own capital. All outstanding debts are being collected in full before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all other transactions are generally limited to cash. The current focus is on consolidating cash reserves to safely navigate this Ten-End hurdle, which is expected to be of no concern.</p>

<h3>The Central Bank Implements Agency for the National Treasury; Public Treasury Law Effective Yesterday; Agency Matters Have Been Properly Negotiated</h3>
<p>After the National Government promulgated the Public Treasury Law and its implementing regulations, it stipulated that the public treasury of the central government is called the National Treasury, which is managed by the Central Bank as an agent; the public treasury of the provincial government is called the Provincial Treasury; the public treasury of the municipal government is called the Municipal Treasury; and the public treasury of the county government is called the County Treasury, each designating a bank as an agent to manage cash, negotiable instruments, securities, and other property for the government. The Ministry of Finance has, after considering the actual situation, stipulated the effective date and scope of this Public Treasury Law: (1) The National Treasury, except for the four provinces of Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ningxia, which will be temporarily postponed, and guerrilla areas or places close to war zones where there are indeed special obstacles, which may be temporarily modified by the competent authority of the Public Treasury, will be implemented from October 1; (2) The Provincial, Municipal, and County Treasuries will be implemented from January 1 of next year, and remote provinces and counties or areas with special circumstances may submit their difficulties to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Government for approval before January 1 of next year, and may be postponed to April 1 or July 1 of next year. The implementation of the Public Treasury Law is to establish a definitive public treasury system for China and is an important measure for reforming tax administration. The matters concerning the Central Bank's agency for the National Treasury have been properly negotiated with the bank.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rice Prices After the Autumn Harvest Depend on Transportation; If Transportation is Smooth, Prices May Fall; Top-Quality Accumulated Rice Still Out of Stock in the Market</h3>
<p>Since various groups ordered foreign rice from Saigon and transported it to Shanghai for price stabilization, and made every effort to dredge the source of domestic rice, the serious panic problem of the people's food in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession has been resolved. As for the market rice price, at this time when late rice is being harvested, it still cannot fall, mainly due to problems such as source hoarding. It is heard that in order to maintain the people's food, various rice industry groups have advised various vendors to dredge the source of domestic rice, so that the Shanghai rice price can fall back.</p>
<p>Suppressing Hoarding: Not Relaxing</p>
<p>At the same time, the concession authorities are sending personnel to secretly investigate the rice stored within the concession at any time, and strictly implementing the suppression of hoarding. Therefore, the Shanghai rice price in the future, because the late rice will be completely harvested, is expected to fall back soon if transportation is smooth. Recently, there is still sufficient new indica rice on the market, but top-quality domestic rice is still out of stock, and retail prices require more than 40 yuan, but less than 1% of residents purchase it, so the impact on the people's food is still light.</p>
<p>Discussing Market: Trading Rules</p>
<p>In addition, the four industry associations of the bean and rice industry, the rice shops industry, the rice milling industry, and the rice distribution industry, as well as the Changshu Rice Office, the Shanghai North Rice Merchant Lianyi Association, and the Nanbang Association, believe that the previously established trading rules for merchants in the bean and rice market are still incomplete, resulting in frequent disputes between merchants and affecting business significantly. Upon the proposal of various merchants, the "Market Trading Rules" were revised. The seven rice industry groups held a joint meeting on September 26 to discuss the revision. It is learned that the seven rice industry groups have again scheduled a second joint meeting for 3:00 PM today at the Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange on Aidoa Road to pass the "Draft Market Trading Rules". The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association has sent a letter to the representatives of the seven rice industry groups.</p>
<h3>Shipping Trends: Japan Attempts to Dominate; Britain and France Barely Maintain</h3>
<p>Since Japan has obstructed the navigation of various countries in China, attempting to dominate the coastal shipping industry, the shipping industries of various countries in China have been affected. Since the European situation has become serious, the impact on Britain, France, Germany, and other countries has been huge. The following is a record of the shipping situation of various countries in China in August: Table of Merchant Ships Coming and Going by Flag: Japan first with 696 ships, 1,071,4699 tons; Britain second with 195 ships, 684,717 tons; Germany third with 26 ships, 137,387 tons; United States fourth with 16 ships, 106,316 tons; Norway fifth with 39 ships, 103,820 tons; Netherlands sixth with 19 ships, 95,206 tons; France seventh with 21 ships, 76,377 tons; Denmark eighth with 22 ships, 74,023 tons; Italy ninth with 9 ships, 52,690 tons; Sweden tenth with 5 ships, 17,189 tons. However, since September, due to the outbreak of the European war, German shipping to China has stagnated, but British and French shipping continues to barely maintain.</p>

<h3>Restricting the Transport of White Coal to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has specifically restricted the transport of matches and white coal to regulate the balance of civilian goods and stabilize prices: (1) A telegram was sent to the county governments of various counties stating that the supply of matches in this province is insufficient and should be temporarily suspended for export. From the date of the telegram, whole baskets of matches are not allowed to be transported out of the province. Strict prevention is required; (2) It is also stated that white coal is one of the daily necessities, and recently a large number of coal merchants have been collecting it and transporting it to Shanghai for sale, resulting in a gradual increase in white coal prices. In order to suppress the market price, exports should be restricted immediately. All coal merchants should abide by this and not violate it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Person Causes Traffic Accident: Fan Baosheng Crushed and in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a Japanese person, Mr. Jia, in a car, passed through the intersection of Tangshan Road and Baoding Road and knocked down a pedestrian, crushing him severely. The police at the post sent the injured person to the Hudong Hospital after the incident. It is heard that the injured person is named Fan Baosheng and is in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Extortion of Leather Goods Shop Owner: Confesses to Instigating Accomplice; Three Defendants Re-examined After Investigation Not Completed</h3>
<p>During the first month of this year, a large number of leather goods were stolen from the Dahua Leather Goods Shop on Yuchiaqing Road. After the owner, Shen Mogu, reported it to the police for investigation, and while the police were investigating, Wang Gentao, Sun Shisheng, and others, who had previously partnered with the shop, went to the shop on January 29 with handguns and forced Shen to hand over 500 yuan in legal tender. Because the police suspected that they had stolen the leather, and were in the process of arresting them, Wang and others resorted to this means. At the time, in addition to verbal threats, there was also actual harm to Shen's life. Shen was extremely frightened and jumped out of the window to escape, resulting in serious injuries to his waist and legs. Afterwards, Wang and others sent letters to Shen threatening him, forcing him to hand over 500 yuan, or else they would do something detrimental to the lives of his entire family. Although Shen reported this to the police, Wang and others were not captured until recently, when Hua Detective Xue Youwen of the Laozha Police Station arrested Wang Gentao, Sun Shisheng, and their accomplice Zhou Chuanmao (also known as Xiao Jiangbei).</p>
<p>Three People Detained</p>
<p>Under investigation, Wang and others confessed that the incident was instigated by Gu Fusheng (nickname Xiao Heitan), the owner of the Zhongyu Leather Box Shop at No. 30, Lane 799, Nanjing Road. When the detectives went to arrest him, he had already fled. Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to hear the case. Shen Mogu claimed that due to his injuries, one of his legs had become disabled, and medical treatment to date had cost him over a thousand gold, as well as various other losses, amounting to no less than</p>
<p>Two or Three Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Therefore, he hired Attorney Wu Peng to file a civil suit as an attachment, requesting that a judgment be issued at the time of sentencing, ordering compensation. However, Police Attorney Ru Baoyi requested a postponement because there were still parts of the case under investigation. Judge Feng, after consulting, ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Private Collection of Copper Coins for Melting: Manufacturing Badges for Profit; The Agency that Cracked the Case Prosecutes for Obstructing National Currency</h3>
<p>Zha Haishan, a native of Zhenjiang who resided at No. 7, Dexing Lane, Wuding Road, secretly bought old-style copper coins and fen coins, melted them down to manufacture badges for various elementary schools for profit. His livelihood was quite prosperous. Each copper plate, after being made into a badge, could be sold for one yuan and ten mei. The secret agency had been established for more than half a year. The other day, Hua Detective Tao Genrong of the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area, learned of this and, together with West Detective Mike Hai, secretly went to the address at 3:15 PM to arrest Zha Haishan. Eighteen copper molds for the badges, 263 old copper plates, 20 fen coins, 960 semi-finished copper yuan badges, and 106 finished badges were seized. The three accomplices Zhang Hongru, Zhao Binghai, and Liu Guochen were also taken into custody and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan elaborated on the cracking of the case and prosecuted under Article 2 of the Criminal Law for obstructing national currency, requesting an extension for investigation. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants and presented the evidence for inspection. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the four defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Crack Down on the Production and Sale of Counterfeit Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Recently, inferior-quality cigarettes counterfeiting the British brand have been frequently discovered on the market, deceiving customers, and there have been repeated crackdowns. At around 4:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Chang, who was dispatched by the Yongtaihe Tobacco Shop, which distributes British brand cigarettes for the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company, learned that someone was setting up a counterfeiting agency in the kitchen of Lu Qitai's shop at No. 22 Caishi Road, French Concession. He reported this to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to the address and arrested Tang Baosheng (36 years old), a native of Wuxi, on the spot, and seized two large bundles of trademark paper for British brand cigarettes and Red Star brand cigars that had been printed. They were taken to the police station together and transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court a few days ago for handling. Judge Qiu interrogated the defendant and ordered a re-examination at a later date. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Manager Sues Accountant: Repeated Payment of Deposit Interest; Committing Embezzlement and Theft</h3>
<p>Lu Jixun, a native of Anhui, 45 years old, the manager of Changda Pawnshop in Chuanxin Street, Daqiao Town, outside the North Gate of Chongming, recently moved to No. 4, Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road, French Concession, due to the fall of Chongming. He hired Attorney Zhang Shibeng to represent him and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, suing Xu Hualiang, the former accountant of the pawnshop (currently residing at No. 3, Fushou Lane, Huanlong Road), for</p>
<p>Embezzlement and Theft</p>
<p>It is alleged that the defendant, while serving as accountant, had a deposit of 1,000 yuan in the account of Liangji. On October 15 of the 25th year of the Republic of China, a new book was issued, and the previous interest had been settled. However, on the general ledger of May of the 26th year, there was a payment of 96 yuan for Liangji's interest, and in January of the 27th year, another 124 yuan was paid. However, from October 15 of the 25th year to January of the 27th year, a total of 15 months and 15 days, calculated at the fixed monthly interest rate of 8 li, is 124 yuan. It can be seen that the 96 yuan paid in May of the 26th year was clearly a duplicate payment. A letter was sent to</p>
<p>Liangji Depositor</p>
<p>To inquire, and it was replied that it had not been received, which clearly indicates that the defendant embezzled it and should be held responsible. In March of last year, due to the fall of the locality, 80 taels of gold jewelry were stolen from Changda Pawnshop, and the defendant is also suspected of being a co-conspirator in the theft. The defendant has now left his post and is hiding in Shanghai and is bound to flee. Therefore, it is requested that the case be arrested and investigated, and that the crime be sentenced according to Articles 336 and 320 of the Criminal Law. The court, based on the complaint, opened a criminal</p>
<p>Second Court Summons</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the other day by Judge Miao Qingbang. The defendant did not appear, only the plaintiff and his attorney were present, requesting an arrest warrant, or that the plaintiff designate the defendant to appear in court for questioning. After consulting, the court ruled to postpone the hearing and allow the plaintiff to designate the defendant to appear in court for a re-examination, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Found a Bomb: Death from Explosion</h3>
<p>At 9:50 AM yesterday morning, Lu Fangqing (57 years old), a resident of the east end of the Sikaizi Bridge in Hongkou, found a small bomb on the riverbank at that location. At the time, Lu did not know that it was a dangerous item and immediately took it home, intending to see what it was by striking it hard with a hammer. Unexpectedly, the bomb suddenly exploded with a loud bang, and Lu was immediately injured by the explosion, his body covered in blood and flesh, a tragic sight. He was taken to the hospital after the incident, but died of his injuries.</p>
<h3>Joking Leads to Murder Case: The Perpetrator's Trial Concludes Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhao Kun, a native of Shaoxing who worked as a carpenter at the Huanqiu Iron Factory at No. 211, Binlang Road, at 1:50 AM on the 9th of this month, had a verbal dispute with Lu Senshui, a copper worker from the same factory and of the same origin, over a trivial matter. He broke into his bedroom with an axe and, while he was sound asleep, hacked him in the head and arms a total of eight times. The case was reported, and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station arrested him and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. The injured Lu Senshui was sent to the same hospital for treatment but died the following morning at 11:00 AM. The corpse was taken to the Jiaozhou Road Corpse Examination Office, where the forensic doctor determined that he had died from axe wounds. The other day, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for murder, stating that the origin of the dispute between the defendant and Lu Senshui was merely a trivial matter. During dinner on the evening of the 6th, Wan Yingchang, a worker from the same factory, played a prank on him by combining two bowls of rice into one, which led to mutual animosity and violence, and the anger was directed at the deceased Lu Senshui, who helped push him down. The matter was very trivial, and Lu Senshui had apologized to him afterwards. Unexpectedly, such a tragic event would unfold. Subsequently, he went to Wan Yingchang's room and struck his head with an axe, but missed, and the axe penetrated the bed wood to a depth of two inches. He is still angry in his statement, saying that Lu should not have helped beat him. It can be seen that his heart is vicious and extremely brutal. He requests that he be severely punished. Judge Huang ruled that he remain in custody and await a scheduled sentencing.</p>
<h3>Pimping Under the Guise of a Domestic Helper: Luring Young Girls into Prostitution; Fei and Li's Daughters Lured into the Trap; Police Crack the Case, the Main Perpetrator is at Large</h3>
<p>A man named Wang Boqing, who runs a brothel at No. 34, Lane 243, Yunnan Road, specializes in luring good women and forcing them into prostitution. However, his method of luring young women is quite ingenious. Wang has a mistress named Tang Lingmei, who usually goes out to work as a domestic helper. If she is hired by a family with a young woman, she will</p>
<p>Flatter and Entice in Every Way</p>
<p>Once they fall into the trap, they will abscond together. Recently, Tang Lingmei was hired by the Fei Song family from Huzhou at No. 4, Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road. Fei has a daughter named Huamei, 17 years old, with a beautiful appearance. She usually has close contact with Li Jufang, the daughter of her relative Li Ni. Tang Lingmei took the opportunity to be deliberately intimate with them and entice them with honeyed words. After a considerable period of time, the two girls were indeed lured and on September 11, Fei Huamei and Li Jufang and Tang Lingmei</p>
<p>Disappeared One After Another</p>
<p>After the families of the two girls found out, they sent out scouts to search, but to no avail. On September 26, Fei Song suddenly received a call from Zhu Xianglong, a barber shop worker at No. 85 Pike Road, saying that his niece was now located and asking him to come quickly. Fei went to the address and met Zhu. Zhu led him to No. 34, Lane 24, Yunnan Road, and indeed saw Huamei, Jufang, Wang Boqing, and others together. At that time, because Jufang</p>
<p>Refused to Go Home</p>
<p>Huamei was taken back alone, and a report was filed with the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Liang Junshan was dispatched to investigate, but Wang Boqing had already fled. Only Li Jufang was found. Xu Jingliang was arrested at No. 227, Andong Hotel, Hubei Road. A woman named Zhang Hua was arrested in Room 61, Xinshanghai Hotel, Fujian Road. Women Wang Peifang and Zhao Xiaochen, Yang Shunquan from Pudong, were arrested in Rooms 8 and 9 of the Wuzhou Hotel on Wuma Road, and Li Suzhen, a 17-year-old girl from Nanxiang, was found.</p>
<p>Taken to the Police Station Together</p>
<p>They were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Court a few days ago. Police Attorney Jiang Baolian stated the case, saying that after Fei and Li's daughters were lured, Wang Boqing deflowered them on the same night in a small inn and then took them to the brothel he opened and forced them to receive guests. Li Suzhen was also the same. The main perpetrator is now at large and a postponement is requested. The court ruled that they be remanded in custody pending further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I saw in your newspaper yesterday's local news section an article stating that the coal market panic is gradually being alleviated, and the lower paragraph of the article quotes a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency as saying that the city only needs 5,000 tons of coal per month and has a previous inventory of 10,000 tons. The information in this is quite inaccurate. Shanghai is a major commercial port with a population of several million. How can the coal consumption and inventory be only this number? Since the Shanghai War, the peak months in the past have required up to 150,000 tons per month, and the lean months have required at least 100,000 tons. The thickest inventory of each warehouse was 400,000 tons, and the thinnest was more than 100,000 tons. The information above is very inconsistent with the actual situation, so I am writing to correct it. Sincerely, Fang Chunpu.</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to my client, the manager of Shunchang Pawnshop at No. 125 Xiafei Road, after reading the newspaper on October 1, Shanghai news bar, carried an pawn shop that suffered a fire, refused to compensate news, which stated that the Baotai pawnshop at the intersection of Fada Road and Baliao Bridge was opened by Chaozhou people Xia Deyang (the owner of Shunchang Pawnshop on Xiafei Road), etc., is very alarming. I checked that the shop is a member of the Shanghai Pawnshop Association, and there is no Xia Deyang. Baotai pawnshop and Xia Deyang are not related to the shop. It is important to the reputation of the shop. Entrusted to the newspaper to make corrections, etc. Accordingly, I am writing to inform you, and I hope you will check and make corrections. Attorney Zhang Shibeng, October 1.</p>
<p>To the Editor: This month on October 1, your newspaper carried an article about a fire in Baotai Pawnshop, refusing to compensate, which is inconsistent with the facts. The owner of the pawnshop is neither from Chaozhou nor is he the owner of Shunchang Pawnshop. This was completely destroyed by fire, according to the rules there is no compensation, as for gold and silver jewelry, because it was not destroyed, it had long been entrusted to the lawyer to be announced redeemable, there was no refusal, nor was there any lawyer Ji Chao coming to negotiate. It is appropriate to write a letter to your newspaper to correct this immediately, in order to avoid external misunderstandings. Attorney Wang Hengyi, October 1, 28th year.</p>

<h3>Children's Clothing Cutting and Design</h3>
<p>— Fen Wen</p>
<p>For ease of calculation, let's assume the width of the fabric is two feet. The number of items to be made is one piece, and the types of clothing are temporarily divided into three categories: long gowns, short shirts, and trousers.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about long gowns. For children aged six to eight, the height of a larger child is about two feet, the waist is five inches, and five feet six inches of fabric should be cut. If it is a lined gown, an additional five feet of lining should be cut. For children aged nine to ten, the average height is two feet five inches, the waist is five inches and one minute, and six feet five inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined gown, an additional six feet two inches of lining should be cut. For ages eleven to twelve, the height is three feet, the waist is five inches and three minutes, and seven feet five inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined gown, an additional seven feet of lining should be cut. For ages thirteen to fifteen, the height is three feet four inches, and the waist is six inches, nine feet of fabric should be cut, and for a lined gown, an additional eight feet five inches of lining should be cut.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about short shirts. For ages six to eight, the length is one foot three inches, the waist is five inches, and two feet six inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional two feet four inches of lining should be cut. For ages nine to ten, the length is one foot four inches, the waist is five inches and one minute, and three feet of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional two feet seven inches of lining should be cut. For ages eleven to twelve, the length is one foot five inches, the waist is five inches and three minutes, and three feet two inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional two feet nine inches of lining should be cut. For ages thirteen to fifteen, the length is one foot five inches, the waist is six inches, and four feet of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional three feet five inches of lining should be cut.</p>
<p>As for trousers, for ages six to eight, the length is one foot six inches, and three feet two inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined pair of trousers, an additional three feet of lining should be cut. For ages nine to ten, the length is one foot eight inches, and three feet six inches of fabric should be cut. For lined trousers, an additional three feet four inches of lining should be cut. For ages eleven to twelve, the length is two feet, and four feet of fabric should be cut. For lined trousers, an additional three feet nine inches of lining should be cut. For ages thirteen to fifteen, the length is two feet two inches, and four feet four inches of fabric should be cut. For lined trousers, an additional four feet two inches of lining should be cut.</p>
<p>This is just a simple and general design. If the body size is different, for every increase of one minute in height, two minutes of fabric can be added, and so on. Smart housewives will definitely be able to expand or reduce according to this principle themselves, without having to rely on tailors or others.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Queller of the Residence—The Cat</h3>
<p>— Yao Ting</p>
<p>When a cat is in the family, rats can be eliminated. Therefore, the cat is worthy of being the bandit queller of the residence. Regarding the cat's form and temperament, everyone knows them, so there is no need to repeat them. The only thing that everyone neglects is the issue of raising cats, especially kittens, which are most likely to die prematurely. People often say that "rats are causing trouble" or "there is no fortune in raising livestock." This superstitious idea is not credible. Based on my actual research, I feel that this problem is nothing more than the following points:</p>
<p>First, cats are carnivores, and their intestines are particularly thin and long, winding complexly in the abdomen. Children often like to catch cats and twist their abdomens forcefully, which can easily cause the intestines to stick together or be injured. As a result, bowel movements become abnormal, digestion is impaired, and death results. Second, kittens do not know when they are full or hungry and eat according to their desires. People often put the food bowl on the table, allowing it to eat at any time, which is not suitable for adult cats; using it to treat kittens is an even greater mistake. Third, salt should be added to the kitten's food. People often only stew small fish plainly, neglecting the salt. Over time, kittens will get sick due to lack of salt. Fourth, kittens often have fleas, which is a major problem for them. It is best to wash them often. Otherwise, sprinkle the powder of camphor balls on their bodies, and the fleas will disappear. Fifth, some places with soft cushions should be prepared for the kittens to live in because if they do not have good sleeping places, they often lodge near the stove, where they are exposed to dirt; the fur is also damaged as a result. Gradually, they are ruined, leading to illness and death.</p>
<p>The five points above are the things that people pay the least attention to but are the most important facts. If you can earnestly study them and improve them, then it will not be difficult to raise a kitten into a lovely, healthy, and bandit-quelling resident.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Last week I mentioned the beauty of crab roe tofu soup, and this week I might as well talk about tofu again. Recently, my family often eats green vegetable and tofu soup, almost every two or three days. These two things are rich in vitamins. Doctors often advise sick people to eat more green vegetable soup, so it can be seen that it is beneficial to the body. Now that tofu is added, isn't it doubly beneficial? Chicken feather vegetables are the best for green vegetables. If you feel that making soup with only chicken feather vegetables and tofu is too monotonous, then you can add other things to it; since we happen to have a piece of ham on hand, we can cut some ham strips and add them together with the side tips of shiitake mushrooms, which will naturally feel even more delicious. If there is no ham, pork strips and beef slices can also be used, so why don't you try it? In addition, meat dishes such as stir-fried tofu with small white shrimp, pan-fried tofu with salted pomfret, and chicken or duck blood tofu soup; and vegetarian dishes such as stir-fried tofu with silk melon, stir-fried tofu with snow cabbage, and stir-fried tofu with garland chrysanthemum, are also wonderful dishes to eat with rice.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Stir-fried beef strips with onions, Stir-fried tofu with white shrimp, Stir-fried amaranth with fried bread sticks, Fried fermented tofu</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>White meat radish soup, Sweet and sour crucian carp, Stir-fried golden needle vegetable, Broad bean paste with chopped scallions</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Beef sweet potato cakes, Braised white fish slices, Green vegetable and tofu soup, Taro dumplings with edamame</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>Stir-fried pork strips with garlic sprouts, Braised tofu with salted pomfret, Stir-fried broad beans with sweet sauce, Braised shredded radish</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>Curry beef slices, Crab in bean batter with edamame, Stir-fried cellophane noodles with green vegetables, Stir-fried hundred-leaf with water caltrop</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>Braised pork with dried bamboo shoots, Stir-fried tofu with shrimp, Snow cabbage with soybean sprouts, Braised vegetarian ten-scene</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
<p>Stir-fried meat with eggs, Pan-fried yellow croaker, Stir-fried water spinach, Mung bean sprouts</p>
<h3>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in an Economical Student Dormitory</h3>
<p>— Jun Mu</p>
<p>The student economic dormitory on the seventh, eighth, and ninth floors of the Wuzhou Building at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road is run by the YMCA, commissioned by the National Student Relief Committee. The association allocated more than 8,000 yuan, and the YMCA donated more than 2,000 yuan, for a total funding of more than 10,000 yuan. Those who are admitted to live in the dormitory, regardless of gender or religion, must be currently enrolled students. Those who wish to live in the dormitory must first have a guarantor (who must reside in this port and have a legitimate occupation) fill out a guarantee letter, the school principal must fill out an identity certificate, and they must personally write a detailed resume and a family financial situation form. Then, they must take them to the dormitory authorities to register. If there are vacancies, they will be notified by letter after an interview and determination that they are qualified. There are a total of ninety-seven beds available, but there are many people who register, always numbering in the hundreds each time. The dormitory has three administrators, including one director, and male and female administrators, who are stationed in the dormitory full-time to manage all matters. The above is a general overview of the student economic dormitory. Now, I will talk about the main topic of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, I will not talk about them in the order of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, but will describe them in order of importance and my personal subjective view.</p>
<p>Regarding housing, since all the residents are students (mostly university students, accounting for more than three-fifths of the total), everything is a group life. Although it cannot be compared with the school life before the war, it is the closest to the ideal under the current abnormal environment. The most distressing thing for students coming to Shanghai for education is the housing problem, which is probably the origin of the economic dormitory. The dormitory has three floors. The seventh floor has one administrator's office, one reception room, six student bedrooms, and one female administrator's bedroom, which is the women's section. The eighth and ninth floors are the men's section. The eighth floor has three student bedrooms and one male administrator's bedroom. The ninth floor has one bedroom and one reading room. The reading room is also located on the ninth floor. The monthly dormitory fee for residents is five yuan, and the miscellaneous fee is one yuan, payable every three months. Students who live in the dormitory for the first time must also pay a deposit of five yuan (currently, due to the increase in the price of water and electricity, a special miscellaneous fee of one yuan is temporarily charged per month from October 1). The dormitory authorities provide each person with a canvas bed and a small desk. The beds in the bedrooms are quite crowded, with two beds always combined together, so they are only used for sleeping. To study, you must go to the reading room on the ninth floor, but the reading room is also quite small, accommodating up to thirty-five people. The room contains four newspapers: Shen Bao, China-US Daily (now discontinued), Xinwen Bao, and Continental Daily (English). In addition, there are various books and magazines for students to read. A world map and a map of China are hung on one wall of the room, with a national flag in the middle, which is rare in an isolated island. Each floor of the dormitory has bathroom facilities, and hot water is supplied for four days every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday afternoons (there is hot water every morning and afternoon every day, but now it is because of the sharp decline in foreign exchange and the high price of various items). Resident students have a student association organization, which holds a general meeting every month to make decisions. The general meeting produces an executive committee to lead all student activities. There are academic, singing, sports, recreation...etc. departments, so student activities are very lively. The academic department publishes a wall newspaper every half month. The academic and singing departments also held two lectures on Mandarin and singing during the summer vacation, which have now ended and achieved satisfactory results. At the closing ceremony, the Mandarin group performed a drama, and the singing group sang various new songs. The sports department holds morning exercises every morning. The dormitory currently employs two tea servers and one boy to clean the student bedrooms, make boiling water, and do miscellaneous tasks.</p>
<p>Regarding food, I am afraid that there is no place in the Shanghai Concession that is cheaper than this dormitory (of course, special circumstances are exceptions). The current full board fee is ten yuan and seventy-five cents per month, and half board (one breakfast plus either lunch or dinner) is six yuan and thirty-five cents. The dining area will use the reading room as a temporary dining hall. In addition, students themselves organize a consumer cooperative, which not only sells practical necessities but also has dry snacks, sweets, and other foods for students to temporarily fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Regarding clothing, most of the residents are poor, so the students' clothes are very simple and rarely extravagant. Because of clothing, I think of the problem of laundry. Students' outer clothes are laundered twice a week, and shorts and undershirts are all washed by themselves. The dormitory authorities also provide drying bamboo for use, and the women's section also has drying racks because the women's long outer clothes are also often washed by themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation, what I want to discuss is not the travel of the resident students outside, but the travel after entering the Wuzhou Building. The elevator can be taken to the sixth floor, and then you have to climb the stairs. At mealtimes, the students on the seventh and eighth floors have to walk up to the temporary dining hall on the ninth floor, which is most convenient for those living on the ninth floor, but usually, it is the most laborious for those living on the ninth floor. Each floor has a large platform that can be used for morning exercises and walks.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of the clothing, food, housing, and transportation situation in the student economic dormitory, which is sufficient for students who want to live in the dormitory to refer to.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The First Day of the Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes</h3>
<p>The public welcomes and exchanges at tobacco shops　Tobacco shops hoard goods for profit at eight cents per dime</p>
<p>It was a clear autumn morning. The newsboys were shouting, "Want to see the fractional currency notes issued by the Central Bank today...one cent red...five cents green..." Because everyone wanted to know how to get their hands on the fractional currency notes, the newspaper selling business was several times better than usual.</p>
<p>At the north end of Mintini Yin Road, a paper signboard hung on the counter railing of a certain tobacco shop. Written on the red paper was: "This shop exchanges fractional and five-cent fractional currency notes." The eyes of passers-by were focused on this signboard. Although there were only a few blue characters, its magic was truly incredible!</p>
<p>"Exchange for fractional currency notes!" A young man stepped onto the sidewalk and put a one-yuan China Bank banknote on the counter.</p>
<p>"I don't exchange for one yuan. I only exchange for a maximum of two dimes per person!" The shop assistant replied while packing fried fruit pulp.</p>
<p>"Why? You don't exchange for one yuan. You can only exchange for two dimes!" The young man asked again.</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm really sorry! Our shop only exchanged for a total of fifty yuan. If each person exchanges for one yuan, we can only serve fifty customers. Because today is the first day of issuing fractional currency notes, everyone wants some. Even if each person can only exchange for two dimes, I'm afraid that those fifty yuan in fractional currency notes will definitely be exchanged in less than two hours. Fortunately, we can continue to exchange tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Why don't you exchange for two dimes first!" The shop assistant explained the reasons very kindly. He took out two five-cent and eight one-cent fractional currency notes, as well as eight ten-cent corner notes, from a small iron box on the counter. He looked at both sides of the young man's one-yuan banknote before putting it into the drawer of the counter.</p>
<p>"What? Two dimes only exchange for one dime and eight cents?" The young man asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Two dimes for nine cents, isn't that cheap? It's much more cost-effective than those dirty stamps and fake vouchers! Besides, if you go to exchange them yourself, it will cost you transportation and time. Now, exchanging for nine cents per dime is just to cover some of our transportation costs!" The shop assistant argued in detail again.</p>
<p>The young man counted the stack of brand-new fractional currency notes on the counter, arranged them neatly, put them in his pocket, and left the tobacco shop.</p>
<p>One after another, those exchanging for fractional currency notes were endless. Because they had been waiting for something for a long time, once they got it in their hands, they were willing to accept it even if the discount was a bit bigger.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour of exchanging, most of the fractional currency notes in the shop had been exchanged. Therefore, the exchange premium also increased to 20% at the same time, "One dime corner note, only exchanges for eight cents in fractional currency notes," but those holding corner notes to exchange for fractional currency notes continued non-stop. Among them, some of those holding corner notes to exchange for fractional currency notes were eleven or twelve-year-old children. They were all driven by curiosity, thinking that it was the most glorious thing to get fractional currency notes first and hold them in their hands in front of their classmates at school.</p>
<p>While the fractional currency notes were decreasing one by one, the profits were also increasing one by one at the same time. When the last part of the fractional currency notes was left, the signboard had already been removed by the shop assistant. At this time, you had to buy some tobacco and miscellaneous goods, and at the same time, you could exchange for a dime of fractional currency notes incidentally. Otherwise, just exchanging fractional currency notes would be met with their contempt!</p>
<p>In just one hour of exchanging, the owner of the tobacco shop had unexpectedly earned a windfall for nothing. (Star)</p>
<h3>Stabilizing China's Currency System</h3>
<p>— Xing Huo</p>
<p>People have endured the suffering of difficult-to-use vouchers, and they are really looking forward to the issuance of new fractional currency notes so much that they are about to cry! No wonder the news of the start of exchanging new fractional currency notes spread, and the whole city was a bit dazed. On the trams and in front of the shops, everyone was asking about new fractional currency notes. When the shop assistant answered "no," they would feel an invisible sense of frustration and disappointment. On the contrary, if they obtained fractional currency notes, an irrepressible joy would flow from between their eyebrows; as if they had obtained a treasure, they would show it to their friends and proudly boast, "Look! Do you have this?" Although the value is only one cent or five cents, those who have not seen it will inevitably cast strange eyes, snatch it over to look at it, and at the same time give it a high-priced critique. "After all, the notes printed by the government are imposing!" However, just look, don't think about taking advantage of it. Not to mention taking advantage of it, even if you accidentally fold a corner of a brand-new, flat fractional currency note, it will make people very unhappy.</p>
<p>Why are people welcoming fractional currency notes so enthusiastically? Waiting for a long time is certainly one reason. But people's "welcoming the new" mentality and the scarcity of circulation in the market have also raised their value. Speaking of the small number of circulations in the market, on the one hand, it is because the Bank of China has adopted a gradual issuance system, and on the other hand, it is because of the hoarding of tobacco and exchange businesses. The scarcer it is in the market, the more severe people's demands will be. And taking the opportunity to profit is naturally no problem. The author is one of those who exchanged nine cents for one dime of fractional currency notes. This has almost become a consistent phenomenon. In the past, when ten-cent and twenty-cent nickel coins and one-cent copper coins were issued, prices were also raised. Half of the formation of this phenomenon is due to the improper method of issuance now. Simply calling on the money exchange industry to issue them is tantamount to giving the money exchange industry the opportunity to profit. And the uneven distribution of the money exchange industry can be seen from the incident of the money exchange industry association arguing and injuring seven people. Therefore, to eliminate miscellaneous vouchers, new fractional currency must be widely circulated among the people; to be widespread, the current method cannot be achieved. The Bank of China's adoption of a gradual issuance system is intended to avoid bank runs, but limiting a number (ten yuan, fifty yuan, or one hundred yuan) will not actually cause much congestion, and circulation in the market will definitely be faster.</p>
<p>The problem must be summarized again to "commercial morality." If we consider moral issues, after being forced to use "Huaxing currency," ordinary merchants have been secretly trading "Huaxing currency." The root cause of this phenomenon lies in the lack of "commercial morality." Although "the heavens are high and the emperor is far away," national law cannot cope with the special actions of isolated islands, but if we do not consider ourselves "slaves of a conquered nation," we must still abide by the laws of the country. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's announcement prohibiting the trading of "Huaxing currency" must be strictly enforced, and the Bank of China's announcement of full cash redemption of fractional currency notes must not be followed superficially.</p>
<p>Stabilizing China's currency system is the responsibility of each of us.</p>
<h3>The Frustration of the Second Landlord's Dream of Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Since the overcrowding situation occurred in the Shanghai Concession, the demand for housing has exceeded the supply, and it has suddenly become insufficient. Although the rent is scary high, it is not easy to rent a house, and rent advertisements are rarely seen. This is inversely proportional to the thick stacks of red, tofu-like rent advertisements posted at every alleyway before "August 13th."</p>
<p>However, Shanghai's deformed prosperity could not last after all. The golden age passed in an instant. Because of the high price of rice and the soaring prices of all goods, most people were trapped on the "isolated island" and could not maintain their livelihoods. If this continued, it would be nothing more than sitting and waiting for death. So, they began to leave Shanghai, either to the interior or back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>This situation can be fully proven by the reappearance of rent advertisements. These days, when we go outside, we can see rent advertisement slips posted everywhere in alleyways and on utility poles. Numerically speaking, although there are not as many as before "August 13th," there are significantly more than a few months ago.</p>
<p>According to unofficial statistics, recently, due to the extremely high cost of living in Shanghai, the number of residents returning to their hometowns or going to the interior has averaged three or four hundred families per day. Those without jobs, who had spent all the money they brought out to escape to the "isolated island," had no choice but to go to the countryside. Even those with jobs, if their salaries were too low, would send their families back to the interior.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the number of vacant houses will naturally increase day by day. In addition, recently built houses can be seen everywhere. So, the overcrowding problem has long passed, and finding a house is not as difficult as it was a few months ago. However, the general second landlords are still dreaming of prosperity. Not only are the rents not cheap, but even old tenants have to pay more rent!</p>
<p>But in fact, people are scattering day by day. In the future, there may be even more vacant houses in Shanghai. By the end of this year, we believe that there will be many more rent advertisement slips posted at every alleyway entrance. Will the second landlords' dreams of prosperity be able to continue forever?</p>
