<p>社評德義與日本　　德意志與義大利以及日本，所共同標揭者，曰反對共產主義也；所力行者，曰不恤以武力變更世界現狀也；數年以來，使鉅數人類遭受慘痛犧牲，使整個國際陷於紛紜擾攘，三國實為之主角也。抑德義與日本之間，究存何種關係乎？何以德義屢為日本而對中國犧牲夙稱輯睦之友誼乎？何以日本對內對外輒挾德義以自重，一似固有所恃乎？何以日本在東亞，德義在歐陸。有若干作為焉，在時間上若合節奏，儼然此呼彼應乎？豈國家間有密約乎？政家間有默契乎？豈思想上信仰上有其感應乎？探討之，搜索之，無有也；有之，惟反共協定；而協定寥寥數欵，僅為對付第三國際之宣傳行動而交換情報而已。彼呼應若合符節者，固非有條約之類為之基礎，祗是政治外交上為環境而臨時運用；有時而運用得當，則頗見其微妙而已。　　德義兩國，有無利害之矛盾，可能之裂痕，存乎其間，姑措勿論，顧目前之相黏着而膠合，形成歐陸之强項軸心，是則不可吾認者也，日本非其儔也。世人不察，稱之三國；其實德義相偶而日本孤獨，三國二體也。假使蘇聯迄未放棄其國際運動政策，而共產信徒在德義日本卓然有為，則三國或成一體。假使德義日本在經濟上各有特長而得以有無相通，則三國或成一體。假使日本蠶食中國者，如德之於捷克，日本鯨吞中國者，如德之於奧地利，義之於阿比西尼亞；則德義日本各以實力相當而樹敵孔多，則三國或成一體。無如蘇聯旣以一國社會主義為政策，復埋頭於第一第二五年經濟計畫之完成，茲且開始其第三次五年計畫矣；於是三國初不必眞為對蘇而沆瀣一氣。德義日本之農工業，同為畸形發展，財富皆菲薄，於是三國無法以經濟意義。自成集團。德義對外擴展，僅流少量之血，對內整軍經武，國勢有蒸蒸日上之觀；而日本遭遇中國强烈之抵抗，實力消耗垂盡，潰敗在即，覆亡可虞；於是亦旣不配稱為門當戶對而偶德義矣。謂反共協定為對蘇聯，日本旣以侵華而喪其尋釁蘇聯之勇氣，抑且喪其資格矣；謂德義有事於蘇聯之日，能得日本臂助耶！故德義為德義，日本為日本，異物也，殊途者也。　　抑三國殊途，或得同歸歟，此一問題，絕無佐證足為正面之論斷。所可參考者，祗有一事；即日本屢屢以分肥許德義，並以餌其他國家；顧事何似乎？據最近二年之中國海關報吿　德日二國對華貿易，消長背馳，約數如次：（單位千元）　　根據右表比較，日劇增而德銳减；夫近年中德貿易之發展，原有一日千里之觀者也，今乃以日本愈侵略而受彼厚諾之德國竟至一落千丈。祗此一端，謂德日終於利益相共者，於以知其大謬不然，固不惟異物殊途而已。　　姑舍政治外交，舍經濟物質於不談，而談精神上或有之感應。則請檢視德義之論據，用以對比日本之作為。德國之於捷克波蘭，謂為少數民族問題也；以此衡之中國之遼吉黑三省如何？義國之於地中海，謂為合於正義之正當要求也；以此衡之日本侵略，謂有耍求合於正義者乎？德報稱義國願望為光復運動，謂一日不光復，一日不安寗；以此論中國抗戰務底於收復失土，曲不在日本乎？義國人民報謂全能國家欲以正義為根據而樹立和平，此與日本以暴力求新秩序，非絕不相容乎？隔昨德國元首希特勒之演說，有警句曰：「德國舊有殖民地已為他國所竊取，此乃道義上不公允之事，經濟上瘋在之舉，」然則日本略取中國領土之不公允與瘋在為何似乎？德義與日本之觀念見解論據之逈不相侔，抑且背道而馳，有若是之甚者，乃謂精神上有何感應之可能耶！　　以一年來之貿易為證，德日之科害衝突如彼；以最近德義朝野之表示為證，德義與日本之刺謬若此；則希特勒與墨索里尼二氏非僅不應放任日本之動輒利用德義云云，抑且應自魂靈上根本割棄日本！應於遠東問題，不假辭色而痛斥日本！惟二氏不能毅然出此，於是日本駐歐各國大使公使，最近且集議於巴黎，謀使所謂反共恊定。改訂為三國軍事盟約矣。希特勒元首之演說，又有言曰「政制之異同，並非戰爭理由所在；」而日本方面之所「吹聽，」則曰「駐德大島大使，將與德外相里賓特洛甫，義外相齊亞諾，進行重要談話，用以奠定新世界之基石；」比較觀之，何其遠耶？是無他，今日之日本，蓄意驅德義兩國於日本之一漩渦，掀為大風浪，先作最後掙扎，徐謀逃生於夾縫之中，終以自掩其獨敗之醜而已！重慶行營結束　軍委會移渝辦公成都將另設行轅　　（重慶）委員長重慶行營、三十一日結束、記者特往訪張主任羣、承接談謂、「重慶行營成立三載有餘、對於西南軍事政治·經濟·交通·之進展、均有相當貢獻、使今日之西南、成為抗戰建國復興之根據地、現時軍委會移渝辦公、行營奉令結束、另於成都設「範圍較小之委員長行轅、已發表本行營賀副主任為主任」、記者又問聞寗遠亦有設置行轅之說、確否、張氏答稱、「寗遠天惠優厚、物產豐富、亟待開發、現已决定設置行轅、主辦其事、此次中央全體會議、對於西南經濟建設、極端注意、已確定大計、並通過完善之計劃、前途發展、自屬無量」、記者因問其對於五中全曾之感想、承答、「此次到會委員、異常踴躍、精神亦極煥發、總裁對於我國國策、剖晰詳明、確信最後勝利、已有把握、予吾人以極大興奮、而近來國際環境、日趨好轉、我國國力、愈戰愈强、敵人已陷於進退維谷之境地、與總裁去年一月在武漢所發表之吿國民書、以後迭次言論之推斷、若合符節、尤足證明我領袖對於東亞局勢之展望、具有高瞻遠矚、眞知灼見、總之、我國十八個月之苦戰、可說打出三個結果、　打破窮兵黷武的敵人之僥倖心、　打出我愛好和平的民族之自信心、　打醒民主國家對於侵略者的不合理智之畏怯心、余個人深信凡一民族堅苦卓絕為世界和平及國家生存而奮鬥、無不成功也」（三十一日電）調訓四省　軍政人員　　（重慶）據華方消息、華方軍事當局、頃决定辦理調訓川滇黔康四省軍政人員、軍官至營連長以上、文官至縣科長以上、辦法正在詳擬中（卅一日快訊電）四千難民　分配到滇　　香港　中央賑委會决分配難民四千人到滇、參加滇緬叙昆兩鐵路建築工作、（卅一日下午十時專電）傳吳佩孚　發表意見　　（北平）吳佩孚今日午前向各國記者發表意見、據稱、二十年前中國內戰發生時、彼卽主張和平、此次中日戰釁爆發以來、結果昭示兩國之戰爭、旣使中國受重大之損失、復不使日本獲得利益、近衛曾一再聲稱、日本並無干涉中國主權或領土完整之志願、是以吳氏認為實現其所主張之和平使命、不應再緩云、（三十一日海通電）　　（柏林）中國駐德大使館昨日下午發表如下之官報稱、「大使館頃接中國外交部來電、指稱、謠傳吳佩孚將出任所謂「綏靖委員會」會長之說、純係毫無根據、接近吳佩孚之人士、對於此類謠諑、亦加以否認」（三十一日海通社電）　　（北平）據外人方面消息、士肥原於一月初　確曾在河內與汪精衛晤面、因汪氏失敗、遂狼狽乘機北返、逼令吳佩存出山任偽總統、唯吳將軍非但不接受、且拍電向友人表白態度、日方計劃遂又擱淺、現士肥原因過去一切奔走工作完全失敗、殊感懊喪、聞在不久之將來、又將花樣翻新、而對吳等採用硬做之手段、以期早日搬演「成功」、而聊以自慰、（卅一日快訊電行政院决議事項　設立長沙市善後建設委會派嚴立三代理鄂省府主席　　（重慶）行政院於三十一日下午舉行第三九九次會議、出席孔院長·及各部會長官、由孔院長主席、首由外王·軍何·分別報吿外交及軍事情形、旋開始討論議案、茲擇載如下、要案彙誌、　經濟部呈擬定非常時期採金暫行辦法及採金局組織規程請核定案、决議、付審査、　敎部呈請補助鄂省聯合中學經費案、决議、照關係部審査擬定數目通過、　內部呈據禁烟委會呈擬派員分赴各省市視察禁政、並擬具出差規則請核定案、决議通過、　湘省府呈請設立長沙市善後建設委員會案、决議、應由該省府積極籌議復興計劃、前有無特設機關之必要、着再核議、任免事項、　院長提議鄂省府主席陳誠因公離省、所有主席職務、派該省民廳長嚴立三代理案、决議通過、　院長提議鄂省委兼財長楊綿仲另有任用應免本兼各職、遺缺任命趙志垚繼任案、决議通過、　院長提議、豫省府委劉燧昌呈請辭職、應予照准、遺缺以潘培敏繼任案、决議通過、　院長提議、魯省府委兼建廳長張鴻烈呈辭本兼各職、應予照准、遺缺任命秦啟榮繼任案、决議通過、　院長提議、浙省委周象賢呈請辭職、應予照准、遺缺任命李立民繼任案、决議通過、（三十一日電）香港猶人　舉行祈禱　　（香港）德籍猶人被逐出境、狀甚慘苦、英屬各地猶人均於二十九日為難胞祈禱、港猶人昨亦舉行祈禱、（三十日電）新疆重慶間　無綫電話已接通　　前日在迪化正式開幕試話時聲浪極為淸晰　　（重慶）新疆與重慶間之無錢綫電話、已於三十日作第一次之試話、今後西北交通、更多便利、實開我西北交通史上之新紀元、先是新疆省政府交通處所轄之迪化無綫報及無綫電話局、以重金購置最新無綫電機件、積極布置、一切就緒、於三十日在迪正式開幕、當由該省主席李溶於三十日下午四時半以無綫電話與該省駐渝代表張元夫第一次試話、李請張代表向林主席·蔣委員長·各院長·各軍事長官致敬·並謂全疆安寗、民衆極關心戰局、繼由張氏報吿、最近中央政情、雙方約談十二分鐘、聲浪極為淸晰、是項無綫電話、不日卽可正式啟用通話、（三十一日電）　　（重慶）今日據可靠方面消息迪化之大無綫電台業已竣工、昨日重慶與迪化曾作第一次試行通話、雙方通話者為新疆省主席與該省駐重慶代表、（三十一日美聯社電）　　（重慶）渝市為應交通需要起見、特增設自動電話、大部工程、業已竣事、下月中可望正式通話、又渝昆長途電話設備、亦已完成、卽定期營業、至渝蘭長途電話、正着手籌辦中、（三十一日電）　　（重慶）迪化與重慶間無綫電話、現已接通、昨日舉行通話試騐時、新疆長官李溶（譯音）與新疆省政府駐渝代表張元甫（譯音）作十二分鐘之談話、聞李請張轉向蔣委員長致敬、並表示新疆民衆對於中日戰事之關切、而張亦報吿重慶政治狀况、聞此次試騐成績、至為美滿、故新疆與四川之無綫電話、不久可公開營業、（三十一日路透電）英大使　寇爾抵津　　（天津）駐華英大使寇爾、今日午後二時半、乘英艦抵此、英總領事與重要英僑皆來迎迓、按寇爾大使於一月二十八日由上海乘太古盛京輪出發、抵烟台後改乘英艦、（卅一路透電馬尼刺靑年　參加八路軍　抗大畢業之後從事政治工作　　（重慶）馬尼刺聖佛南陀靑年李成（譯音）年二十六歲、從戎參加第八路軍、由馬尼刺經香港·貴陽·重慶·西安·而至延安·沿途曾乘民船步行、乘軍用卡車、為時共五閱月、始達目的地、氣侯雖寒、仍穿熱帶衣服、身已無分文矣、據聞現已易名為「李佛蘭克林」、與美國之羅斯福總統同名、蓋兩人均「為自由及民主之愛好者及戰鬥者」、渠在延安抗日大學畢業之後、從事於政治工作、（卅一日美聯社電）　　為讀者諸君着想　一年之健康與幸福  威靈登　　我人投身社會，無異效命疆場，危機四伏，無法趨避，風寒暑濕，疫氛病菌，環繞於吾人之周圍者，不啻飛機大砲，溜彈步鎗，偶一不愼，鮮有不危及生命者，此種危機，以都市為多，而鄕村較少，故人生壽命之統計，鄕居者平均較市民為高，非無故也，但我人旣因家庭之累，為衣食計，為子女計，不能不於風塵中僕僕以求生活，然則以身體為孤注之一擲，而不計及「生命防衛術」乎，是烏乎可，蓋物必自腐而後蟲生，疾病之來，亦必乘虛而入，抵抗力强者，能化大病為小病，小病為無病，抵抗力弱者，則多愁善病焉，故衛生第一要義，在增進五口人身體抵抗疾病之力量，此未雨綢繆之方法，以較臨時抱佛脚，而頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚者，有效多多，冬令進補，卽為明年保健地步，故選擇適宜補品，其有關於一年之健康與夫經營之事業者，至深且大也，論普通補品，以鱉魚肝油為最上，以其含有多量之甲丁兩種維他命也，惟魚肝油往往以質地不純，或腥味太重，胃弱者尤有不易吞服之弊，「威靈麥精魚肝油」，係選取挪威產最上等淸魚肝油，質地純淸，絕少雜質，毫無腥味，和以眞空濃縮之大麥芽膏，再佐以芳香美味諸品，科學調製］功能滋陰，養肺，補腦，補血，開胃，健脾，壯肌，强骨，且以含有甲乙丁諸種維他命，故不僅芬芳可口，且老幼咸宜，實為冬令進補之惟一妙品，至於身强無病，胃口較佳之人，如喜服淸魚肝油者，「威靈純淸魚肝油」亦極適用，蓋以質地純凈，濃厚無腥，故功力較大，又以直接多量輸入，故定價較廉，可謂實惠的補品，此「威靈」牌兩種魚肝油，現由二馬路大舞台對面正威大藥房發售，適値該兩補品發行十週紀念，大贈送一萬瓶，定價「威靈麥精魚肝油」三磅瓶一元八角，「威靈純淸魚肝油」大瓶二元四角，一律買一送一（電話九二五二五購買不取送力）惟存貨不多，轉瞬額滿，凡預謀一年之健

<p>科學與人生  中國科學社上海社友會主編發刊辭  驥千　　今日之世界，一科學支配之世界也。世界各國凡能生存而不至於滅亡者，幾無一事不需乎科學。科學之範團甚廣，門類甚繁。然的而言之，可分爲兩大類：　目然科學，　社會科學。屬於　者，爲數學·物理·化學·天文·地質（地文學氣象學地理學等附之）·値物學··動物學（生理學心理學等附之）·等等；其屬於實用者，有各種工程學，如土木工程·機械工程·電機工程·化學工程；又有建築學·鑛學·農學·森林·醫藥等學，乃利用數理化動植地等純粹科學之基礎，施之於利用厚生者。屬於　者，有政治·法律·經濟·社會·敎育·歷史等學。雖非嚴意之純粹科學，而亦基本於數理生物等學，對於國計民生，有極大之效用者。其餘爲此篇所不及論述之學術，凡含有科學之性質者，要皆不離乎以上所言之兩大類。　　科學效用於人生者，不可勝數。茲就其最顯著者，言其大凡：如大地之廣漠無涯，世界各國，相距恒至數萬里之遙，復有崇山峻嶺淵海重洋爲之阻隔，彼此接觸往來，在古昔之時，乃屬絕不可能之事。自科學發達，交通之工具，愈進愈精，有輪船火車飛機無綫電等物，竟使自然界之一切險阻爲之减少，空間問題，得以解决，全球各處之交通，遂有今日之便利。地球係一無窮之寳庫，其中所蘊蓄者，最初於人生之所需，古代人民聽其埋沒堙鬱，無法開發利用。近世科學家硏究各種岩石之形成，觀察古生物之種類及其分佈，將地層之年歲及搆造加以確定；復因化學機械學之發展，遂能挖掘陶鍊，金銀煤鐵汽油等鑛，皆爲人類所汲取。世界之平原廣野，皆有農作物滋生其間。因生物學物理化學等之施諸農業，耕耘收穫，日漸改良，獲利之豐，什伯於昔日。世界之水陸各處，工業原料散佈充斥，以生物調查地質調查化工電工等項推進，有機無機之物，多可吸收利甩，製造之精，乃日新而月異。人類之健康壽命，因醫藥等學之進步，較昔日大爲增加。人類之衣食住行，無不因科學發達之故，大爲改進，視百年或數十年前人類所可享受者，其優劣美惡，不啻天淵之別。其餘人生需用科學之處，不知凡幾。人類賴科學而進化，毫無疑義。故近世文化水準最高之民族，其科學人才必最多，科學之事業亦最盛。然其最宜爲吾國人注意者，乃以科學之爲物，不徒爲人類生活之所需，亦能使人類之思想有條理，有系統，悉合目然之定律，得眞正之人生觀，以之立身行事，適應環境，無不攸往咸宜。在個人爲優秀之份子，在全體爲優勝之民族。一國之人民能如是，其國內之敎育乃格外發達，社會之秩序，必極形安定，國家之財力充裕，國防之實力雄厚，政治修明，長治久安，無內憂，無外患，國運臻郅治之隆，人民享昇平之樂。故科學者，實國家民族療貧救弱之良藥也。　　今日文明之國度，其人民不能須臾離乎科學。吾國人民欲求生存於斯世，力避劣敗之慘禍，除竭力提倡科學，使國禿產生多數之深造專家，以應一切之急迫問題外，而一般人民皆宜有科學之常識，俾能於日甩生活之中，處處利用科學而受其裨益。蓋惟國內一般人民，大多數皆通曉普通之科學，社會之兀氣，得因之而培厚，民族之潛力？因之而加强，國祚可以長久也。然科學之常識，如何可以吸取？個人對於科學之致力，如何可以進行？其最初之步驟，在能時時讀閱普通科學刋物，以爲日就月將，積微成鉅之計，普通科學常識，如本欄所載者，皆屬簡單淺近；稍受普通敎育之人，自易通曉而無扞格；倘能行之以不息，持之以有恒，關於純粹科學（如，算，理，化，動，値，地，等）或實甩科學（如工，農，醫，與他涉及社會科學者），於時常閱覽之時，分門別類，擇要摘錄，預備一普通之科學基礎，以期能有融會貫通之一日。習之稍久，可就個人興趣最濃，天性所近者之一門，從事專攻，而於其他各門，仍時時閱讀，繼續摘取，務期對於一般科學，晚其大意，對於所喜愛而專攻者，有更進爲求之能力，所謂於各門知其略，於一門知其說也（To　Know　Something　of　everythnig　and　to　know　one　thing　well）。此乃求學之定律，凡有志自修者皆不可忽視此義。吾國人民若能潛心於科學，有科學之常識者日見其衆，將來必有科學之專家產生於其中。美國之愛迭生，其初何嘗不因讀普通科學之刋物，發生興趣，肆力深造，後來成爲曠世無匹之大發明家，其在實用科學之貢獻，造福全世之人類，此吾國有志自修之靑年，所宜奉爲模範者也。且人民之科學常識倘能豐富，其智識技能，爲之增長，思想眼光品行道德，健康體力爲之邁進，謀生問題自易解决，是乃優勝之民族，不受天然之淘汰，則社會進步國勢自可日强矣。今者國人戮力奮鬥以求生存，因往昔科學在吾國不甚發達，致受空前之浩刦，當此國難嚴重之時期，愛國之士，宜急起直追，竭智盡能，努力於科學救國之一途，必有補於最後之勝利，及將來之建設。此本攔諸文之發刋，乃冀與國內有心人互相期勉者也。科學和酒醋工業  心君　　法國巴斯德要令人相信科學是有益於工業的，可以帮助生產，直接富國利民的；所以他有一次同他的助手瞿克樂帮了許多玻璃器具，趕到他的本鄕亞罷窪地方去，硏究葡萄酒的病，好挽救這垂危的釀酒工業。先借了一間舊咖啡店的屋，佈置成他的實騐室。煤氣燈也沒有，自來水也没有。臨時用風箱吹的炭爐，和自汲的井水。一切裝置都是臨時雇幾個銅匠做起來的。巴斯德去奔訪了許多以前的熱友，向他們討了種種的酒。有的是酸的，有的是苦的，有的是粘的，有的是變油的。他從經騐上知道釀酒是靠酵母的作用，推想酒要變壞，一定是另有一種小生物作怪。果然不錯，他把這些酒一樣一樣的放在顯微鏡下面細看，粘酒裏面有一串一串的特別小生物。苦酒裹面又是一種，壞酒襄面又是一種。於是他就招了許多做酒生意的人來，顯他的本領了。呌他們帶了各種怪味的壞酒來，就對他們說：「我用不着嘗，就可以知道你們的酒，出了什麽毛病」。當時的人自然都不信他有這種本領，不過他們想借此開開他的玩笑。各自帶了酒去。有的故意夾些好酒在裹面。那裏知道他在顯微鏡下面都看出來了。一樣一樣的指出那些酒的毛病，連那一瓶好酒也給他指定是好的。到塲的人都驚異得目瞪口呆。從藐視的心理一變而爲欽佩的心理。大家異口同聲的說他是了不得的一個奇人。巴斯德等到衆人散發之後就同瞿克樂商量，怎樣對付這些小生物的方法，使它們不會將好酒變成壞酒。最後他們果然發明了一種方法。就是在酒剛要釀好的時候，將酒微溫不必煮沸，那來裏面即使有了可厭的微生物，也就滅絕了，酒就不致夢壞了。這種方法就是現在所用的滅菌法，西文就用他的名字呌做巴斯德化（Pas　teurise）。　　法國東部的人從他學了這種方法，就解决了他們的壞酒問題。法國中部的人又鬧着要他去解决釀醋問題。巴斯德就趕到都爾司地方去，照樣的用顯微鏡做他的工具。人家告訴他醋　裏面常有一種特別的浮渣，是做醋的一種標記。要是沒有這種浮渣，酒就變不成酷。果然不到幾個星期，他研究出來這些浮渣都是些整千整萬的小生物。最後他召集了醋商在一起，吿訴他們這一種微生物，喝了酒就變醋。在幾天之禿可以造出比它們本身重一萬多倍的醋。譬如一個人有一百一公斤重的身體，在四天之內會劈一百萬公斤的木頭，你想這種能力是不是駭人聽聞。然而這些小生物就會有這種本事，所以我們不可以輕視了微生物的工作。巴斯德就因此想到一隻象，一頸牛，或是一個人，可以給一個微生物的力量所弄死。這並不是一件不可能的事。他在離開都雨司之前，就代醋商解决了怎樣培植養育這些釀醋的微生物，使它們好好的做釀醋工作，將氧加到酒上去。結果是巴斯德差不多送了本地的醋商一份値幾百萬佛郎的厚禮。巴斯德像  （君琪繪）煤是什麼？　怎樣燃燒？  鏡淸　　煤是構成地殻的許多礦物之一，世界各地都有產生。通常深埋於地下，須打礦井，把它開採，但也有些地方可用採石方法來採煤的。　　煤礦中的煤通常不是一塊一塊而是一層一層的。煤層厚薄不一，有時僅數寸，有時達數尺。兩煤層之間有岩層或粘土層隔開，亦有被含油頁岩所隔開的。有些地方煤床距地面深達六里而煤層並不甚厚。　　要採煤須掘一井或深洞，在穿過煤的地方，向各方向開鑿隧道，把煤挖出，留着隔開煤曆的材料。挖出的煤塊由懸在礦井中的吊車升到地面，一方面在挖掘處植立支柱，以防煤層的頂倒下。　　地質學者吿訴我們，煤是數千年前甚至數百萬年前蓋沒地面的豐富植物的遺骸，比人類的出世還要早。產煤地在那時候的土壤很肥沃，氣候很溫暖，樹木野草長得很高。　　在地殼變動的過程中，地面發生了極大的變遷。以前爲樹木茂盛的乾地，漸漸下沉而變爲海底。於是河流挾着砂和野草而下，把它們堆置在這海底上。　　因砂和野草愈堆愈高，它們的巨大重量，再加以地球的蘊熱，把下面的樹木壓成實塊，這就是我們所採的煤。　　河流不斷地把砂增高，先前的沉砂乃被壓而成石，我們在這種岩石中可我到海生動物的貝殼和化石，這就證明了煤床是一度被水所淹過的。　　在格林蘭和北坎拿大之間有一個地方呌貝芬蘭，那裏有二處大煤田，煤就產在地面，可用鏟子掘出。那地方是極端嚴寒的，在附近三千里內見不到樹木。可是探險家會在那地面下發見過一大樹林，保存得很完好。這些樹木臥倒的方向，好像它們是被海風所吹來的一般。甚至樹頂上所結的果實也仍新鮮。這一切指示我們在某一時期的貝芬蘭必定比現在溫暖得多。　　植物同動物一樣，由四種主要元素組成——碳（炭氣），氫（輕氣）氧，（養氣）和氮（淡氣）。其中氮的數量極小。樹葉從空氣中吸收碳酸氣，這氣體是由碳和氧所組成的。植物把碳留住，用以構成身體，而把一部分的氧放回到空氣中。　　植物的根吸收水，由水中取得氫，因爲水是由氫和氧所組成的。氮也由根所吸起，供植物的滋養。　　煤旣經是由腐敗的植物所變來，我們就可推知它也是由碳，氫，氧和氮所組成。在腐敗的過程中，它失去了它的氧和氮的大部分。一塊重一斤的普通煤的含十二兩碳，半兩氫，二兩氧和氮。　　在燃燒時，碳和氫發出大量的熱。氫在煤中雖比碳的成份少得多，可是同樣重要，因爲以同重量而論，氮比碳發出較多的熱。　　燒煤非氧氣不可。氣氣普通由空氣供給，因爲空氣是氣和氮所組成的。我們的身體裹不斷地在燃燒。我們吸空氣入肺，血液就從這空氣吸收氧氣，傳佈到全身使它和組織接觸。氧氣被燒而成碳酸氣，這氣體又送回到肺中，在那裏與氧氣交換而呼出。我們身體覺得暖，即由於這種燃燒，我們也由此得到行動，說話和思想的能力。　　我們若在一間不通風的小室裏停留，氧氣就很快的用完，而有碳酸氣使我們中毒，燒煤也是如此。煤須有不斷的氣氣供給，才能維持不熄。　　初把煤加熱時，氫氣和一部分碳氣化合爲一種氣體，呌做碳氫化合物。實際上碳氫化合物因成分有不同，乃有許多不同的氣體。它們是重要的氣體燃料。　　我們坐在火旁，注視煤中發出氣流，有時裂成火熖，我們就見到了碳氫氣。但在煤塊尙未够熱時，有些碳氫化合物並不發爲氣體，還有些就在煤的表面上凝成一種軟脂狀的東西。　　通常由於火的溫度還不足以燃着此種碳氫氣，於是有黑烟和烟點發生，’如此就耗費了大量有用的熱。所以燒煤爐必須使有充份的空氣供給。　　某一處謀田的縱剖面，顯示一　一　被埋的樹木和陸地。圓中A指砂岩，B爲頁岩，C爲煤　，D爲炶土層。有人駕駛的炸彈  鴛　　空軍人員在高空中投擲普通炸彈常感不易中的，共故由於他們不能隨從炸彈落下，引導它們達到正確的鵠的。這個問題巳有一個解决。內部能容一個駕駛員的炸彈現在巳有人設計完竣。這種炸彈自一萬呎高空擲出，由伏在彈內的駕駛員駕御，使之滑翔至正對距目的物約三千五百呎的上空爲止。然後任它　直落下，不難中的。　　那位駕駛員怎麽樣呢？他背上有一個降落傘，豫備他達到目的地之前，脫離炸彈安全降落。爲避免降洛在敵營的危險，這種炸彈現在只能限於海戰之用。因此特爲他另備一隻可携橡皮艇和充足的糧食，使他降至水面後能在水上飄流，以待獲救。據說用這種炸彈可以擊沉價値二千萬金鎊的戰艦，而駕駛員自己卻能乘一葉扁舟，奏凱而旋云。（英國臂椅科學）世界科學消息無綫電燈之新發明  （紐的時報，旦）　　法國人柯斯得爾發明用無綫電波點燈，最近業巳取得專利權。此種新式燈泡爲球形，並無燈絲，內部係眞空而塗以發燐光或其他發光之粉狀化學品。當被高頻率電波所激發時，即發出明亮之光。使用時以之懸於一條線（金屬綫）上，此鎳即用作一雛型無錦電發送站之天線。由此吾人預測將來或可用此種燈泡以照明街道及住宅。用以照明街道時，所用之天線即以單根線充之，而以之照明室內時，則可以平行或成扇形之線作天鎳。兒童電話局  （蘇聯年報社，旦）　　莫斯科「文化與休養中央公園」中設有電話局一所，一切工作均由兒童擔任，共有綫路八十條，連接於該公園內兒童農村中之各房屋及各機關。另有電話收話器二十五架設置於農村中之各處，每處代表一個外國之著名城市。其用意在於使兒實利用電話，作國際通話，而與某國通話時，卽用某國言語。任職於電話局者爲五十個阿基米得學會之幹練會員，該學會專爲靑年發明家而設。人造可塑物  （紐約時報，旦）　　美國森林服務社中有四位研究員，發明用木屑，稻草，廢木料及甘蔗莖，製成有用之人造可塑物。發明者以此數種廢物中任何一種，加水及生色精，於蒸氣壓力下煮之，則有一硬而重，黑而亮，如玻璃狀之物生成，對於水及濕氣有甚高之抵抗力。此物爲極佳之電器絕緣體，且能範成鈕扣，門上捻頭及汽車上之把輸，無鎳電器之底板等。該種可塑物製造之程序甚簡，僅需三小時之蒸煮。其中含有原來之廢物百分之八十五至九十五。於所生成之化合物乾燥後，以之碾成粉末，若加以熱，且施以一千五百至三千五百磅之壓力，此粉狀物即能範成人造樹脂云。古代種子至今還能發芽  （美國科學通訊，鴛）　　有幾顆東方紅蓮的種子會埋藏三百年至五百年之久，近經芝加哥野外博物館的適當處理後，居然能發芽。這種種子係得自南滿洲，由鄔格敎授從一個古井底內掘出者，這個井底從前是一個湖底，該種子會被掩埋在裏面。在種子發現的地面上有一株柳樹，直徑四呎。相近的一株較小柳樹被伐下後，計其年輪爲125個。因此該敎授斷定道種種子埋藏的年期必在三百年至五百年之間。他將種子試種後，發現它們仍舊能發榮滋長。</p>

<p>春秋不必與無益  佛　　昨報載柏林可靠消息，希特勒本屆演講，將較往年爲長，甚至較希氏已往任何演講爲長，講稿約二百張，洋洋數萬言，非歷二三小時，不能畢其詞。希先生這樣的演講，未免太吃力，老年人不相宜也。希先生的演講稿，在記者撰此文時，尙未拜讀，講些什麽？天然不得而知。但以我度之這洋洋數萬言的大文，我可以拿兩語來槪括盡，第一語是鞏固義德軸心，第二句是收回殖民地，其實非但演講稿子太長，有所不必，即此種演講，亦屬多事，因爲希先生的心事，已昭昭在人耳目，固不必再藉演講宣傳，而使人家喩戶曉也。其實希先生有興，不妨索性做一部「侵略技術史」出來，給世人拜讀拜讀，倒也未始不可，這樣長篇累牘的演講，眞是何苦呢。　　又見報載，日本東京帝國大學政治經濟學敎授河合博士，曾著一書，被當局認爲擾亂和平與秩序，禁止發行，近新校長平賀博士蒞任，遂從事善後不穩份子，致政治經濟科免職或辭職者，不下十餘人。和合先生英吉利的是什麽書？連日本人民沒有福氣去拜讀，我們更談不到有機會去寓目，不過和合一書，日本當局認爲擾亂和平秩序，禁止發行，天然不滿於軍閥之所爲，可以槪見。其實日本人民反戰情緖的高張，除軍閥外，几普遍一致，尤其是智識階級，更爲熱烈，不過迫於軍閥淫威的勢力之下，無法反抗，不得不忍氣吞聲，苟安緘默，但時有慷慨悲歌之士，時時表示其不平，致被一般爲虎作倀之流，從而羅織之，淸除之，其人民亦大可哀矣。但是此种壓迫手段，到底不能長久，所謂「防民之口，基於防川，勢必有潰敗決裂之日，並且壓之愈高，必决之愈甚，防之愈力，必潰之愈廣，祇見其心勞日拙而已。河合博士且忍耐着，不要灰心，不久必有吐氣洩憤之一日盛筵席上  巴盾　　峨巍的大樓裏，我站在窗前。朝下望，行人如螞蟻，汽車似長蛇。電炬在閃，像街頭的神女，放着誘惑之光。　　是大都會夜的一角。　　熱氣在室內盪漾，像春風吹着水面泛起陣陣漣漪，人們的面上紅噴噴地，彷彿誰都敷上了一層胭脂。瓜子在「畢剝」的響，從盒子裏被送進嘴脣，接着很快地被拋在地上了。　　「怎麽，屠先生還不來？」老李抓了把瓜子，不耐煩地看了看手錶，又添了一句：「七點敲過了！」　　還來不及有人湊上去搭訕，一個聲音跳起來：「來客！」門帘被撩起來了，進來的正是我們的屠先生。　　人們全站了起來，讓笑容儘在臉頰上滾，不同的嘴裏爬出各種不同的話語：　　「哈，說起曹操，曹操就到，」　　「豈有此理，人家跟你慶壽，你這麽遲才來！」　　「罰酒！罰酒！」　　「非罰不可！」　　嚷聲裏大家入了席。　　菜一只只地更換，酒一杯杯朝各人肚裏灌。　　「一品！六，六！全家福—祿！」福祿二個字呌得特別響。　　楡者把酒杯拿起，「殻！」一聲。空杯子向各人面前一幌，張大喉嚨喊：「添酒！」　　另一對又在那裏起勁地廝殺了！　　門帘一動，現出一個少女。遞進一張印滿照片的紙兒。　　「喂！幹什麽的！」老李第一個發現，把眼皮向上一挺，興奮的臉頰上帖着一個浮滑的笑。　　「你自己看呀！」　　猜拳聲停住下來，各人的眼光移到這少女身上。少女微微笑着。　　「就是你好了！」老李喊起來，接着又說：「慢，慢，再添一個！」眼光在紙頭上溜。　　那個女郎走近他身邊，指着一個照片說：「她很好！會說會笑，人又生得漂亮。」　　「好，就是她。」老李在她肩上一拍。　　於是那少女一蹦一跳地跑了出去。　　「他媽，這家伙生得不差！」老李抺了抺油嘴，喝了口酒。　　似乎人們的精神更興奮了。　　又是一蹦一跳地，那少女回了進來。「馬上就來！」說過，用不到別人請，在老李身邊坐下了。　　堂倌遞進。一盆魚翅，老李吃了一匙，興奮地說：「大家多吃一點，滋陰補陽的呢。」　　哈哈哈……　　大家全笑起來，那嚮導女的笑聲更響亮。　　來啦！另外一個。胖胖的身材，圓臉上堆着一堆胭脂，眼睛在笑，嘴脣　塗滿了血。　　「那一位先生？」手裏拿着卡片紙。　　先來的那個立刻迎上去，半拖半拉在小吳身邊一推。　　「先生貴姓是？」　　「吳先生。」又是那先來的嚮導女搶着回答。小吳臉上一陣紅，結結巴巴的說：「不是我，不是我！喏，喏，屠先生，他……」把手指向對面一指。　　屠先生笑了起來：「哈哈，小吳怕難爲情嗎？好！就是我。」　　胖身材移了過去，屠先生在她胸口就是一把。很意外地，那少女泰然一笑。　　「唱一個！」　　「對，唱一隻！」　　在大家的敦促下，一個女子的喉音　盪起來：　　「好花不常開，好景不常在……」　　菜，酒，笑，佔領這全部的小室。然而我胸腔裏活躍着一股憤恨的火花。我的腦子有點昏脹了！　　實在再無法坐下去，我推說難過要先走。儘管他們熱烈的挽留，但是我終於辭了出來　　走出大門口，象逃出魔窟似的，我鬆了口氣。　　在歸途上，一個近乎慘呌的聲浪在我耳邊直撞：「餓殺了！要餓殺了呀！」　　一桌丰腴的筵席又在我眼前出現了，還夾着那輕浮的笑，笑，笑。　　我的心開始劇疼起來。新「刺馬」  小于先生　　舞台上有一齣呌『張文祥剌馬』的老戲。事實是張文祥和馬新甫再和另外一個把兄弟同靠軍功發了跡，老大—馬陞到制台，老二和老三—張也都做了官。不料老大飽暖思淫，竟和老二的老婆通了奸，幷且借了一個罪名把老二活生生的砍了，于是惱了老二出來把老大刺死。　　『唯中華民國二十有八年一月二十八日中華民國漢奸政府新任參議兼任國民政府資源委員，前國民政府軍事委員會參議，廣東財政廳長，……前淸秀才，三朝元老馬公育航「遇害」「殉職」于上海孤島新新旅館』。這齣準演不慌的『新剌馬』我把它大書而特書！　　老的「剌馬」爲的是通奸，洩的是私怨，新的「剌馬」爲的是漢奸，報的是公仇。時代雖然不同，公私雖然有別，而奸究竟是犯不得的，一句老古話呌「奸近殺」眞是至理名言。「花濺淚」公演前夜　訪問上海劇藝社記  常質夫　　于伶繼「女子公寓」後的新作「花濺淚」，已定於本月七日（即下星期二）晚塲在卡爾登戲院獻演，上海劇藝社的全體伙伴們正在該劇導演吳永剛氏領導下或排練或籌劃，工作是非常緊張的。　　上海劇藝社是集中了孤島最優秀的話劇，演員和劇作者最優秀的話劇，演員和劇作者組織成的，在目前是一個獨一無二的演技水準最高的話劇組織。過去公演了二次，一次是吳伊之導演，法國巴若來原著的「人之初」，第二次是幸之許導演，大文豪羅曼羅蘭原著的「愛與死的搏鬥，」二次的成績都是使孤島人士認爲最滿意的演出的。　　這一次出演「花濺淚」是該社第三次公演，在卡爾登的時間，已經決定從下星期二起至星期五只演晚塲，星期六（十一日）及星期日（十二日）日夜兩塲，票價分一元五角兩種。　　「花濺淚」的演員，是由藍蘭飾米米，夏霞飾丁香，張婉君飾顧小妹，丁芝飾曼麗，莫言飾常海才，夏風及屠廣沂飾金石音，徐立飾小李，周起飾匡先生，孫芷君飾茶房，朱蕃飾小郎，陣容是很可觀的，四個舞女中的籃蘭和夏霞是讀者們很熟悉的，用不着贅述。其他兩個演顧小妹的張婉君和演曼麗的丁芝是新人，張婉君在不久以前的上海基督敎學校救濟失學靑年聯合會演托爾斯泰的「黑暗的勢力」一劇中，她是飾主角花月英的，當時演出的成績是得到極好的批評。至於屠廣沂也是國立戲劇學校畢業生，在上海劇壇上雖是新人，以前在南京是沒有人不知道他的。　　「花濺淚」的導演。是中國電影界素聞負衆望的名導演，他擁有無量數的觀衆，他的「壯志凌雲」和「胭脂淚」「離恨天」是不朽的傑作，這一次雖然是第一次導演舞台劇，成績在現在尙未演出之前，我們雖不能斷言，但是憑着吳氏導演影片的豐富經騐，一定會有新的手法，這是我們可以預的言。他向記者表示，導演「花濺淚」感覺到十二分的興趣，將來希望再有二次，三次的嘗試。他並且還說；『因爲演員的努力，「花濺淚」的演出，也許不至於使觀衆失望，但是我自己却十分膽寒，因爲是第一次嘗試』。　　在劇本方面，承原作者于伶先生會談，知道在演出時和書本上有幾處更動，或是因客觀環境所限，或是求演出效果更好，不免改動了几處，　　這一次的置景仍出孤島劇壇惟一的老手徐渠和池寗兩位美術家合作。「花濺淚」中的挿曲「舞女曲」原是由音樂家陳田鶴譜的，現在更請了黎錦光做了一隻爵士化些的曲，以便舞女們可以學習而在舞塲內唱出。雨過天青  包天笑　　第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生　　不過中國自從與敵國請和以後，敵國也一變而爲友邦了。有許多在博物館裏陳列着的紀念品，有使友邦人士太遺羞，太難堪的，也都收藏了起來了。因爲中國本來有大國民的態度，一向以寬厚待人，不爲已堪的。除了這博物館以外，後來又建築了個圖書館。但這個圖書館，規模不大，還沒有第十八遺族學校的圖書館大咧。他們意思是這樣的，這咱圖書館，不是像從前所謂藏書樓那種性質，却是一種閱覽室那樣的性質。所以那裡面的圖書，却是極普通而有關實用的，一切略古的書，這裏便沒有，綫裝書更不必說了。不過雜誌日報，較多一些，但也只限於國內，西文書報，這裏也就很少。這原是供到此游公園者偶然翻閱，不是可以參考幫硏究學問的。然而近來附近鄉民，識字者日多，他們也常常到這裏看書閱報了。我今且說金澹雲等四人，且說且笑的走到公園裏來。因爲今天是個星期日遊人甚多，尤其是男女學生。不但是爲了近傍有這個遺族學校的關係，也有別處學校的學生，或是遠足旅行，或是集體巡游，都來瞻禮先烈墓，順便再逛一逛公園，公園裏盡有的是草地。他們有的席地露餐，什麽罐頭食物，麵包水果，吃一個飽。有的在草地上開起音樂會來了，什麽口琴演奏咧，提琴獨奏咧，再不然，帶了一具留聲機器，唱幾隻雄壯的歌曲，少年人更有激昂慷慨的氣勢。最令人發笑的，從前爲了戰時激厲人心，有一种街頭戲劇，鄉村中隨便到那裡，都可以開演，非常簡單的。有些學生們，也在公園的草地上開演起來，圍聚了許多人。倒像從前中國的廟塲上頭把戲的一般，然而這裏却是很有意識的呢。金小姐道：『我們且到博物館裏去巡禮一回。凡是到些瞻仰先烈的墓的，博物館好似不能不去的。但要把博物館細細的看一下子，至少要三四天工夫，可以看一個大略。現在我們進去巡禮一回，只可以算是走馬看花罷了。』他們行近前時，只見博物館的門前，就有一座很高的大理石紀念塔，也是紀念戰時陣亡的忠勇先烈的。（二八）</p>

<p>自由談法西斯蒂拔萃  白櫻　　今日在法西斯蒂國家的文人，只有二條出路；一條就是屈伏於法西斯蒂的　威下，上焉者爲法西斯主義製造些歪曲欺騙的『理論』，下焉者只好做做捧塲應聲的帮閒者；另一條出路就是轉入地下層，爲反法西斯作英勇的鬥爭·所以究極說來，眞正的出路原只有後者的一條，前者雖是暫時的出路，實際卻是一條斷巷。　　但正像耶穌所說的：『天國的門是狹的，只有少數人能够進去。』法西斯國文人的眞正出路，也是極狹的，沒有對正義和眞理具有絕大的信心，沒有機牲個人生命以上的精神，是難以踏進這條出路的。於是我們就看到了所謂『轉向』文人的大批出現。　　在法西斯國的文人『轉向』，就是表示文人的沒落。這說明早先這輩人曾經對眞理發生憧憬過，或甚至爲眞理鬥爭過。但因爲他們的信心薄弱，經不起暴力的威脅，結果只得『轉向』趨於絕路·不過像在另一篇文中說過的，無論在國際上，國內政治上，以及在個人的信念上，對法西斯主義的議步，就等於爲自己掘墳墓。我們從下面所述的日本法西斯派正從文人對於『轉向』文人的『禮讚』中，可以看出『轉向』文人的一失足成千古恨。　　『…許多轉向者、像秋風落葉般從無產階級的運動中跌了出來。我對於他們不勝憤怒地加以痛罵。這倒並非因他們離開了我的陣營。從立塲言，他們聞無寗更接近我了。然而我對於這種思想的無節操性，實在感到不快。轉向就轉向了，但等到運動已臨困難而再轉向，實在是卑汚極的。　　『日本的社會，能容許這許多變節的人物，眞是怪事。』杉山平助著『中國，中國人及日本」，一四〇頁）　　『迄最近爲止·一味在自由主義空氣中呼吸的人們，忽然搖身一變而爲大陸進出的勇士，而且超乎常情的嘲弄鄰國人民·這種行爲的動機在那里，姑且不問，但這輩人的知性究竟丟到那里去了呢，多年來的理論和節操，又流到那裏去了呢？　　『對於馬克斯主義的轉向者，也可以同樣的說。迄最近爲止，馬克斯和恩格斯的喇叭卒認爲眞理只存在於這輩人的筆下，把一切事物都從這一觀點來測量，對於其他一切，一槪輕視，漠然，非難並攻擊，大有地上不久即將化成馬克斯的王國…一味地宣傳這種福音，並以殉敎者自誓·可是道一輩人，會幾何時，忽然來說敎東洋文化，日本文化，而以東亞協同體的新選手姿態登塲了。』（室伏高信，『知性之再建』一文，『日本評論』一月號）　　翻了一看，也許耍認這是日本自由主義者和馬克斯主義的戰士在責駡他們的叛徒，實際上卻是法西斯蒂喉舌對『轉向』文人的奚落。雖然他們在後面板起了道義的面孔，帶拍带駡的『禮讀』了一番，但在我們看來，拍是有作用的，嘲駡才表示他們的有『先見之明』，他們老早投着了主人，對於想分吃一杯羹的『轉向者』，露出了一副獰笑的圓目。　　信心微小的人們呵，你們垂涎的那根骨頭，早已在別人的嘴裏了！　　但在我國，迷於托派和漢奸思想的人們，若肯幡然覺悟，這意義和日本文人的『轉向』，是絕對不同的，因爲這里的一座分水嶺是正義。在這里沒有奚落，沒有諷嘲，而是對於迷途之羊的歡迎。一軟一硬的演出在德國的集中營裏（中）  頑譯　　在第十一天，我們牢獄裏有十二個囚徒被幾個守衛驅逐到沒有窗戶的卡車裏，我們將往那裏去呢？難道是去受審的嗎？每個囚徒被關在那小得僅够容納囚徒坐下的車室裏，車旁有許多狹長的空隙可使空氣流通，這些孔隙卻給予我們一個偷視車外景物的機會。車飛速地離開這城市的一小時以後，我忽然看到一塊發着光亮的路牌，上面正寫着「德州」兩個字，德州！　　德州的集中營被高墻圍困着，裝着機關槍在墻上裝着高度電網，後面有兩個木柵，被夾在那兩塊木柵中間的一塊空地便是所謂中立地帶；有誰在中立地帶被那守衛者所發現，那人馬上便要變爲一連串機槍子彈下的犧牲品！　　在這些種種防止囚徒脫逃的障礙物底後面便是營幕了，在這營慕裏住着三千餘個年齡的在十九歲至七十歲之間的政治犯——共產黨員，社會主義者，猶太人，收師和納粹底級變者，他們被分爲一百人一組，由那鐵石心腸的百分之二百的納粹黨員看管着，這些納粹黨員的年齡大概在十八至二十之間——正是足够擁護主義的靑春時代，他們用槍和刺刀武裝着，他們通常是所脚來踢人的。　　我被派在從未見過的最悽慘，最悲痛的一組裏，這羣人本來都是律師，醫生，與舊日的官吏，他們都會受過高深的敎育，而是目前德國的最優秀的份子，而現在呢，卻被壓制得運說話的勇氣也沒有，高墜使他們失卻了希望。沒靈魂的他們正漸漸地走向那死亡的路上去。　　「你在這裏多久了？」我詢問裏面的一個囚犯，那人用毫無表情的目光凝視着我，接着，不發一言地走開了，我冉詢問另外的一個囚犯，那人也同樣用無情的目光來注視一下我，接着，又悄悄地跑開了。　　當第三個人被我詢問的時候，他含糊地低聲說：「傢伙，你應該當心！我們目前的談話很容易發生許多困難的，我們以後可以再譚的！」　　這是我對於同伴們所發生的一種新的快樂，以後好久，我也設法來避開那一切新來的囚徒，爲了疑惑他們是法西斯蒂派來的騙子，大部份被解到德州來的囚徒們都是像我一樣，——爲了不慎而被吿發。　　那個警吿我不要多說話的朋友還指示我怎樣來整理被褥與小櫥。　　「你底一切的作爲都應聽從他們底命令！」他勸我說，「倘使你不這樣做的話，他們便要把你囚禁在「暗室」裏——孤獨地監禁着；所吃的是冷水與麵包。這是一間無光無熱的房間，有一個執着那粗鞭的守衛。」　　我們一天的生活開始在上午五點鐘。早餐是一盃咖啡與一些些黑麵包，五點半他們來點名，並且來督派我們一天的工作。三個猶太的囚徒中總有一個被他們派爲担任淸理營厠的工作，假使守衛對於某位囚徒的工作不滿意時，他就可以使用那武器——「踢」。　　每個囚徒在六點鐘起開始工作——站在沒膝的汚泥中來打掃那潮濕的地方，或是幹那令人背脊發痛的堆石子的苦工，工作對於一切的政治犯都是一視同仁的，無論你是十九歲的靑年或是七十歲的老人，當營醫生證明那個囚徒確是不能担負很苦的工作時，那個囚徒才可以仍舊被關禁在集中營裏。有許多老年人因爲不能勝任工作的重荷，便被守衛者帶了出去，從此，我們再也不能看到他們了。　　每一組人由十五個守衛來監護。有時，我因爲不能很快地來遵從守衛的意思，於是那守衛便要狠命地用脚來亂踢我的背脊。那種事情是時常發生的。　　中午，我們回到營裏去用午膳：一罐水，蔬菜與一些黑麵包。據說在這罐子裏是有肉的，但是我卻從來沒有發現過一塊肉。　　半時後便進行檢查，假使在囚犯中有一些衣服不整齊而被發現出來的話，那便要處罰在「暗室」裏囚禁一兩天。　　我們大家所引爲普遍的恐懼的，卻是見到那些從「暗室」裹回來的傢伙，他們雖不言不語，但在他們赤露着的背脊上可以看出皮鞭的傷痕。這鞭子是納粹甩來便囚從們瞭解法西斯眞諦的工具，因爲不知道那些傢伙在集中營裏到底遭些什麽遭，因此更使我們在悲慘的囚禁中加上了許多莫名的恐怖啓事　　（一）刻接王水先生來信，謂一月二十四日所載「痛苦的火花」，先已發表於「學生生活」第二十八九期，惟題名不同，及開首多二句耳。據此，「痛苦的火花」照例取消酬資。謝謝王水先生。　　（二）本刋來稿甚多，可用者亦不少，因此有積壓稍久，方得登出者。茲後投稿諸君，如己另投他處，發表後務請來示通知，以免浪費木刊篇幅。編者見聞有限，尙請見諒。　編輯室中篇小說烽火中  周燕　　一　戰鼓聲中的歡迎宴　　陽歷十一月初旬的天氣，在江南一帶，還不十分寒冷，人們穿一件夾衣，也勉强可以把一個初冬度過去，走遍整個合浦鎭，很難我到一個穿着棉衣的人。　　合浦鎭是位置在蘇嘉鐵路以西靠近太湖邊上的一個中等市鎭，離開鐵路綫的有三十餘華里，鎭上的居民，除了一部分地主外，犬都務農爲生，兼營蠶桑捕魚等副業，日出而作，日入而息，生活倒也非常安定。因爲和鐵路綫相距有三十餘里的緣故，交通很是不便，鎭上鄉公所裏所定的一份老申報，常常要躭擱上一天纔會看到，也可看出不便的程度了。　　這天是十一月九號，合浦鎮上仍舊和平時一樣，從太陽出來的時候起，人們就紛紛的活動了，一切都使合浦鎭上的早市顯得非常熱閙，有生氣。還有更熱鬧的事，是素來冷淸淸的鄕公所，這時也開直了大門，有不少衣冠齊楚的人在大廳上走動，好像在迎候什麽貴客似的。　　的確，他們是在迎候一位貴客。這貴客，便是率部在蘇嘉路南段盛澤王江涇一帶擔任防守的葉方俊團長。葉團長也是合浦鎭人，他是鎭上有名的紳董葉巽卿老先生的大公子，葉老先生在前淸會經中過舉，鼎革後便隱居不仕，用全副心力來培値他的子女，果然代國家作育出了葉團長那樣的英才。這决業團長便道返里省親，消息給合浦鎭的鎭長陳兆前知道了，於是便在鄕公所裏舉行了一個歡迎宴。（一）</p>

<p>Page 4</p>
<p>Editorial: Germany, Italy, and Japan Germany, Italy, and Japan commonly proclaim their opposition to communism. They are actively pursuing the alteration of the world's status quo, even through military force. For several years, they have caused immense human suffering and plunged the entire international community into turmoil. These three nations are, in fact, the main protagonists in these events. But what kind of relationship exists between Germany, Italy and Japan? Why have Germany and Italy repeatedly sacrificed their longstanding, friendly relationship with China for the sake of Japan? Why does Japan, both domestically and internationally, rely on Germany and Italy to bolster its own standing, as if it has something to depend on? Why do the actions of Japan in East Asia and Germany and Italy in Europe seem to be synchronized, with each echoing the other? Is there a secret agreement between these nations? A tacit understanding between politicians? Or is there a resonance in their ideologies and beliefs? Upon investigating, we find nothing of the sort. The only thing they have in common is the Anti-Comintern Pact, a pact with only a few clauses, merely serving as a tool for propaganda against the Third International and for exchanging information. Their seemingly synchronized actions are not based on any treaty but are simply political and diplomatic maneuvers employed temporarily due to the environment. When used appropriately, they can appear quite subtle. Whether there are conflicts of interest or potential fissures between Germany and Italy is something we won't discuss for now. But the current cohesiveness forming a strong European axis is undeniable. Japan is not in the same league. The world mistakenly refers to them as three nations; in reality, Germany and Italy are paired, while Japan stands alone, making them two distinct entities. If the Soviet Union had not abandoned its international movement policies and if communist followers were significantly active in Germany, Italy, and Japan, then the three nations might have become one entity. If Germany, Italy, and Japan each possessed unique economic strengths that allowed them to mutually benefit, then the three nations might have become one entity. If Japan's encroachment on China resembled Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia, or if Japan's swallowing of China resembled Germany's actions in Austria and Italy's in Abyssinia, then Germany, Italy, and Japan, each with comparable strength and numerous enemies, might have become one entity. However, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of socialism in one country and is focused on completing its first and second five-year economic plans, now even starting its third five-year plan. Therefore, the three nations initially had no real reason to unite against the Soviet Union. The agricultural and industrial structures of Germany, Italy, and Japan are similarly imbalanced, and their wealth is meager. Thus, the three nations cannot form an economically self-sufficient bloc. Germany and Italy expand outwards with limited bloodshed, while internally reorganizing their military and governing, presenting a picture of growing national strength. Japan, however, faces strong resistance in China, depleting its strength and nearing collapse, with its demise a cause for concern. Therefore, it is no longer worthy of being considered an equal partner to Germany and Italy. To say that the Anti-Comintern Pact is directed against the Soviet Union is misleading because Japan has lost its courage and even its qualifications to provoke the Soviet Union due to its invasion of China. Can Germany and Italy expect Japan's assistance if they have dealings with the Soviet Union? Therefore, Germany is Germany, and Japan is Japan; they are different entities on different paths. Can these three nations, on separate paths, possibly converge? There is no evidence to support a positive assertion. The only thing we can consider is that Japan has repeatedly offered shares to Germany and Italy and used them as bait for other countries. But what does this look like? According to the recent two years of Chinese customs reports, the trade between Germany and Japan with China has diverged in opposite directions. The approximate figures are as follows (in thousands of yuan): According to the comparison of the table on the right, Japan's trade has increased dramatically while Germany's has sharply declined. The development of Sino-German trade in recent years was originally progressing rapidly, but now, with Japan's increasing aggression, Germany, which received generous promises from Japan, has plummeted. From this one point alone, to say that Germany and Japan will eventually share common interests is clearly wrong. They are not only different entities on different paths. Let's put aside political and diplomatic matters, and economic and material considerations, and talk about potential spiritual resonance. Then please examine the arguments of Germany and Italy to compare with Japan's actions. Germany, regarding Czechoslovakia and Poland, speaks of the issue of ethnic minorities. How does this compare to the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in China? Italy, regarding the Mediterranean, claims it is a just and legitimate demand. Can Japan's aggression be said to have any demands that are just? German newspapers claim that Italy's aspirations are a restoration movement, saying that there will be no peace until restoration is achieved. If we apply this to China's war of resistance, which aims to recover lost territory, is the blame not on Japan? An Italian people's newspaper says that an all-powerful nation wants to establish peace based on justice. Is this not entirely incompatible with Japan's pursuit of a new order through violence? In a speech yesterday, the German leader Hitler made the striking statement: "Germany's old colonies have been stolen by other countries, which is morally unfair and economically insane." So what does Japan's seizure of Chinese territory in terms of unfairness and insanity look like? The concepts, views, and arguments of Germany, Italy, and Japan are so dissimilar, and even run counter to each other to such an extent, so how can it be said that there is any possibility of spiritual resonance? Taking the trade of the past year as evidence, the conflict of interests between Germany and Japan is like that. Taking the recent expressions from the German and Italian governments and public as evidence, the absurdity of Germany and Japan is like that. Then Hitler and Mussolini should not only refrain from letting Japan exploit Germany and Italy at every turn, but should also fundamentally abandon Japan from their very souls! They should condemn Japan harshly on the Far East issue without mincing words! But because the two men cannot decisively do this, Japanese ambassadors and ministers to various European countries recently gathered in Paris to plot to transform the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact into a trilateral military alliance. Hitler's speech also included the statement that "differences in political systems are not a reason for war," while the Japanese side "blew the whistle," saying that "Ambassador Oshima to Germany will hold important talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to lay the foundation stone for a new world." Comparing the two, how far apart they are! There is nothing else. Today's Japan intends to drag Germany and Italy into its own vortex, stir up a great storm, make a final struggle first, then seek to escape through the cracks, ultimately covering up its own shameful defeat!

A reporter made a special visit to Director Zhang Qun, who said, "The Chongqing Headquarters has been established for more than three years, and it has made considerable contributions to the progress of military, political, economic, and transportation in the Southwest. Today, the Southwest has become a base for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The Military Affairs Commission is now moving to Chongqing to work, and the headquarters is ordered to end. Another "Chairman's Headquarters with a smaller scope" will be set up in Chengdu, and it has been announced that the headquarters' Deputy Director He has been appointed as the director." The reporter also asked if there was a saying that a headquarters would be set up in Xichang. Zhang replied, "Xichang has generous natural endowments and abundant products, which urgently need to be developed. It has now been decided to set up a headquarters to take charge of this matter. The Central Plenary Session has paid great attention to the economic construction of the Southwest, and a grand plan has been determined and a perfect plan has been approved. The future development will be immeasurable." The reporter then asked about his thoughts on the Fifth Plenary Session. He replied, "The commissioners who attended this meeting were exceptionally enthusiastic and energetic. The President provided detailed and clear analysis of our national policies and firmly believes that the final victory is already within grasp, which gives us great excitement. Recently, the international environment has been improving, and our national strength is growing stronger as we fight. The enemy has fallen into a dilemma, which is in line with the President's predictions in the appeal to the nation delivered in Wuhan in January of last year and subsequent speeches. This further proves that our leader's outlook on the situation in East Asia is insightful and profound. In short, our eighteen months of hard fighting can be said to have produced three results: Breaking the enemy's侥幸心(spirit of僥倖), 打出(evincing) our peace-loving nation's 自信心(self confidence), 打醒(awakening) the democratic countries' 理智之畏怯心(rational trepidation) towards the aggressors. I personally deeply believe that any nation that struggles arduously and resolutely for world peace and national survival will succeed" (31st dispatch). Transferring and Training Military and Political Personnel from Four Provinces (Chongqing) According to Hua Fang news, the Hua Fang military authorities have recently decided to conduct transfers and training for military and political personnel from the four provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang. Military officers will be at the company and battalion commander level or above, and civil officials will be at the county section chief level or above. The methods are currently being drafted in detail (31st quick report). Four Thousand Refugees Assigned to Yunnan Hong Kong The Central Relief Committee has decided to assign 4,000 refugees to Yunnan to participate in the construction work of the Yunnan-Burma and Sichuan-Kunming railways (31st, 10 PM special dispatch). Rumor: Wu Peifu Expresses Opinions (Beiping) Wu Peifu expressed his opinions to foreign reporters this morning. He reportedly stated that when the Chinese civil war broke out twenty years ago, he advocated peace. Since the outbreak of the current Sino-Japanese war, the outcome has shown that the war between the two countries has not only caused China to suffer significant losses but also failed to bring benefits to Japan. Konoe has repeatedly claimed that Japan has no desire to interfere with China's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Therefore, Wu believes that the realization of his proposed peace mission should not be delayed any further (31st Haitong dispatch). (Berlin) The Chinese Embassy in Germany issued the following official statement yesterday afternoon: "The Embassy has received a telegram from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the rumor that Wu Peifu will be appointed as the chairman of the so-called "Pacification Committee" is purely groundless. People close to Wu Peifu have also denied these rumors" (31st Haitong Agency dispatch). (Beiping) According to foreign sources, Itagaki definitely met with Wang Jingwei in Hanoi in early January. Because Wang's scheme failed, he fled back north in embarrassment, forcing Wu Peifu to come out and serve as a puppet president. However, General Wu not only refused to accept but also sent a telegram to his friends to express his attitude. The Japanese plan was then shelved again. Currently, Itagaki feels extremely frustrated because all his past efforts have completely failed. It is said that in the near future, he will try new tricks and adopt coercive measures against Wu and others in order to stage a "success" as soon as possible and console himself (31st quick report).

Jews in various parts of the British Empire held prayers for their distressed brethren on the 29th. Jews in Hong Kong also held prayers yesterday (30th dispatch). Wireless Telephone Between Xinjiang and Chongqing Connected The sound was very clear during the official opening test call in Dihua the day before yesterday. (Chongqing) The wireless telephone between Xinjiang and Chongqing made its first test call on the 30th. From now on, Northwest transportation will be more convenient, truly opening a new era in the history of Northwest transportation. Previously, the Dihua Wireless Telegraph and Wireless Telephone Bureau under the Xinjiang Provincial Government Transportation Department purchased the latest wireless electrical equipment at great expense and actively deployed it. Everything was ready, and the official opening was held in Dihua on the 30th. At 4:30 pm on the 30th, the province chairman, Li Rong, made the first test call to Zhang Yuanfu, the province's representative in Chongqing, via wireless telephone. Li asked Representative Zhang to pay respects to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, the presidents of the various branches of government, and the military commanders, saying that all of Xinjiang was at peace and the people were extremely concerned about the war situation. Zhang then reported on the recent central political situation. The two sides spoke for about twelve minutes, and the sound was very clear. The wireless telephone can be officially used for communication soon (31st dispatch). (Chongqing) According to reliable sources today, the large wireless radio station in Dihua has been completed. Yesterday, Chongqing and Dihua made their first test call. The speakers were the Chairman of Xinjiang Province and the province's representative in Chongqing (31st Associated Press dispatch). (Chongqing) In order to meet transportation needs, Chongqing is specially adding automatic telephones. Most of the project has been completed, and it is expected to be officially in operation by the middle of next month. In addition, the Chongqing-Kunming long-distance telephone equipment has also been completed and will be put into business on a set date. The Chongqing-Lanzhou long-distance telephone is currently being planned (31st dispatch). (Chongqing) The wireless telephone between Dihua and Chongqing has now been connected. During a communication test held yesterday, Xinjiang's official Li Rong (transliteration) and Zhang Yuanfu (transliteration), the Xinjiang Provincial Government's representative in Chongqing, held a twelve-minute conversation. It is reported that Li asked Zhang to convey his respects to Chairman Chiang and expressed the Xinjiang people's concern for the Sino-Japanese war, while Zhang reported on the political situation in Chongqing. It is reported that the results of this test were very satisfactory. Therefore, wireless telephone service between Xinjiang and Sichuan will soon be open to the public (31st Reuters dispatch). British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Arrives in Tianjin (Tianjin) British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived here at 2:30 pm today on a British warship. The British Consul-General and important British expatriates came to greet him. It is reported that Ambassador Kerr departed from Shanghai on the Taikoo Shengjing Wheel on January 28, and after arriving in Yantai, he transferred to a British warship (31st Reuters dispatch). Manila Youth Joins the Eighth Route Army After Graduating from Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, Engages in Political Work (Chongqing) Li Cheng (transliteration), a 26-year-old youth from San Fernando, Manila, joined the army to participate in the Eighth Route Army. He traveled from Manila via Hong Kong, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Xi'an to Yan'an. He traveled by passenger ship, on foot, and by military truck for a total of five months before reaching his destination. Although the weather was cold, he was still wearing tropical clothes, and he was penniless. It is said that he has now been renamed "Li Franklin," the same name as U.S. President Roosevelt, because both are "lovers and fighters for freedom and democracy." After graduating from the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, he is engaged in political work (31st Associated Press dispatch). For the Sake of Our Readers’ Health and Happiness in the Coming Year - Wellington We are thrown into society, which is akin to throwing ourselves onto the battlefield. We are surrounded by crises that we cannot avoid, such as wind, cold, heat, humidity, epidemics, and germs. These are like airplanes, artillery, stray bullets and rifles, and if we are not careful, we may endanger our lives. These dangers are greater in cities and fewer in the countryside. Therefore, in terms of life expectancy statistics, those who live in the countryside live longer on average than those who live in the city. It is not without reason that this is the case. However, we are burdened by our families, and for the sake of food and clothing, and for the sake of our children, we have no choice but to toil in the dust to seek a livelihood. If this is the case, should we stake everything on our physical health without regard to the "art of life defense"? This is surely unacceptable. Things must first decay before worms are born, and diseases only come when there is a void to enter. Those with strong resistance can turn a major illness into a minor one, and a minor illness into no illness, while those with weak resistance are prone to worry and illness. Therefore, the most important principle of hygiene is to increase the ability of the five members of a household to resist disease. This method of preparing for a rainy day is far more effective than waiting until the last minute to seek divine help, or treating the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt. Winter tonic is the groundwork for health care next year, so choosing a suitable tonic is of utmost importance to the health and business endeavors of the coming year. Speaking of common tonics, turtle and fish liver oil are the best, as they contain large amounts of vitamins A and D. However, fish liver oil is often impure or too fishy, ​​and those with weak stomachs may find it difficult to swallow. "Wellington Malt Extract Fish Liver Oil" is made from the finest Norwegian clear fish liver oil, which is pure, clear, and has very few impurities and no fishy taste. It is mixed with vacuum-concentrated barley malt extract and supplemented with aromatic and delicious ingredients, scientifically prepared. It functions to nourish yin, nourish the lungs, nourish the brain, nourish the blood, improve appetite, strengthen the spleen, strengthen muscles, and strengthen bones. And because it contains vitamins A, B, and D, it is not only fragrant and delicious, but also suitable for people of all ages. It is truly the only wonderful product for winter tonic. As for those who are strong and healthy and have a better appetite, if they prefer to take clear fish liver oil, "Wellington Pure Clear Fish Liver Oil" is also very suitable. Because it is pure, thick, and not fishy, ​​its potency is greater. And because it is directly imported in large quantities, the price is lower. It can be said to be an affordable tonic. These two types of "Wellington" brand fish liver oil are now sold by the Zhengwei Pharmacy opposite the Great Stage on Er Ma Lu. It is the 10th anniversary of the release of these two tonics, and 10,000 bottles are being given away as gifts. The price of "Wellington Malt Extract Fish Liver Oil" is $1.80 for a three-pound bottle, and the price of "Wellington Pure Clear Fish Liver Oil" is $2.40 for a large bottle. Buy one get one free (call 92525 to purchase but does not include delivery). However, the stock is limited and will be gone in a flash. Anyone planning for health and happiness in the coming year should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>Hitler Frankly States Desire to Achieve Territorial Claims Germany and Italy Struggle Together Germany Will Help Italy if Attacked Japan's Collapse Deemed Unfavorable to Germany (Berlin) Yesterday, on the 6th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, leader Hitler delivered an important speech to the Reichstag. The surge in national morale can be said to have reached its peak. The crowds surrounding the parliament were estimated to be tens of thousands. In addition to the 855 members of parliament, the diplomatic corps and press seats in the venue were fully occupied. The parliament convened at 8:00 pm sharp. First, the Speaker of the Reichstag, Goering, requested Dr. Frick, the Minister of the Interior, to speak. Frick immediately proposed that Goering be elected as the new Speaker of the Greater German Reichstag. The entire audience unanimously passed the proposal. Goering then gave a brief speech and invited leader Hitler to deliver an important speech (31st Haitong dispatch). (Berlin) In his speech to the House of Representatives last night, leader Hitler said, "If another country wages war against Italy, regardless of the motive, Germany will definitely assist Italy without any doubt." He then discussed the colonial issue and raised demands for both Germany and Italy, stating, "Germany's former colonies have been stolen by other countries, which is morally unfair and economically insane. It is unimaginable for a great power with a population of 80 million to remain in an inferior position for so long. This situation is the same for Germany as it is for other countries in a similar position. It is very clear that if the world's resources are not rationally divided, they must be redistributed by force" (31st Havas dispatch). (Berlin) When mentioning Japan in his speech to the House of Representatives last night, Hitler said that the determining factor in the relationship between Germany and Japan is the common recognition of the need to curb the dangerous tide of Bolshevization in a blind world. The German people are determined to do this with all their might. The anti-communist common goal may one day become the crystallization point of a group of powers, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the harm caused by the devil to world peace and culture. The Japanese nation has set many glorious examples of heroism in the past two years and will strive to serve civilization in the Eastern world. The collapse of Japan would be detrimental to the civilized countries in Europe or other parts of the world and would only allow Bolshevism to gain a decisive victory in the Far East (31st Reuters dispatch). Hitler's Speech (Berlin) Last night, Hitler delivered his long-awaited speech in the House of Representatives, stating that Germany has no hatred for France and Britain and is willing to coexist peacefully with them. Germany has no territorial claims on these two countries other than its original colonies. The crux of Hitler's speech is that his party will have a long period of peace in the future. If Italy is dragged into the vortex of war, Germany will fight shoulder to shoulder with it. This is absolutely certain. Germany is much easier than other countries to wage economic warfare. Germany does not want colonies to station large armies, but purely to alleviate economic difficulties. Germany has not asked other countries to adopt Germany's own trade plan. Germany's relationship with the United States has been disturbed by false propaganda. We do not allow Americans to interfere in our German affairs. One thing is very clear to the German people, and we allow them to be very clear about it, that is, Germany is undoubtedly always in a particularly difficult economic situation. We must indeed fight, but we will definitely win this struggle. Today, I tell you that we have already won this victory. Hitler recognized the statement of democratic countries that Germany was plotting against the Netherlands, saying that the idea that we would attack them because the United States or South America or the Netherlands had different political systems was absolutely inaccurate. We do not pay attention to spreading National Socialism abroad. Recalling the History of Struggle Establishing National Socialist Regime At the beginning of his speech to the 855 members of the Greater German House of Representatives, Hitler recalled the events of January 30, six years ago, when the Nazis took power. He said that at that time, about 13 million National Socialist Party men and women voters were behind him, while the remaining 20 million people were separated from him, scattered among fifteen political parties and small groups. The only factor that united them was a common aversion to our movement. They fought for a long time to resist the National Socialist Party and compete for leadership in order to protect their interests. They colluded with the Jews, and the politically minded bishops of various churches all raised their hands to bless them. At that time, only the mystery of the last hour could save Germany. Our enemies scoffed at our belief in this mystery. If Germany had fallen into the turmoil of Bolshevism that day, it would have inevitably accelerated the crisis of the entire Western civilization to an unimaginable degree. Only the most limited islanders can imagine that the Red Fist had once lingered and shrunk before the dignity of democracy or on the borders of unrelated countries. When Mussolini and Italian Fascism rose up, the salvation of Europe began on the other end. The National Socialist Party carried out this rescue work on the other end. Today, we are able to witness in a more distant place that the international attempt by the Jews to sweep away the world's culture in Europe has also been bravely overthrown. Six years is enough to realize the dreams of centuries. Those who are without ideological knowledge are easy to believe that we have achieved this result without struggle. In fact, before the unification of Germany this year, we had been fighting fanatically against political doctrines for nearly twenty years. We have used unwavering will to implement courageous resolutions in order to strive for this success. The Annexation of Austria into the Territory Gloriously Received the First Test Hitler then gave a detailed account of the events of 1938, the merger of German and Austrian ideologies, and the annexation of Austria into German territory in the end. He said that all of this was carried out so quickly, without a break. Our confidence in the speed and efficiency of the new Germany has not been disappointed, and has even exceeded our original plans. Hitler mentioned the day of Germany's mobilization during the Czech crisis, saying that we did not threaten anyone. We only tried to defend ourselves to prevent attempts by third parties to interfere. In the future, we will not tolerate any attempts by Western powers to interfere in matters that are entirely related to us in an attempt to prevent natural and reasonable solutions. This is something I need not assure you again. Therefore, we were all very happy when we began to establish friendship with Mussolini. Chamberlain and Daladier's adaptability was also very admirable. Relying on the strength of these two men, we were able to find a principle of agreement, which not only allowed the urgent events to be resolved peacefully, but also could be regarded as an example of the possibility of making a general and reasonable decision on all important issues. If the great powers were not determined to solve the problem in this way or another, they would never be able to complete this unification. At this time, there was no need to draw a knife for national unification, but only to draw a knife for self-preservation in the face of external threats. The German youth army has gloriously received its first test. Urgent Need for Territory to Alleviate Economic Difficulties Hitler then emphasized that what makes a country great is strict discipline within the country and the unity of the national strength. After the Great War, Germany was forced to pay huge contributions and reparations, and its colonies were also stripped away. From an economic point of view, seizing Germany's colonies was completely unconscious. Before the European War, the democratic countries all heard that if Germany disintegrated, Britain's trade would naturally become more stable. But Britain and its people have not become richer as a result, and today Germany is stronger than before. We do not want colonies to station large armies. We have a sufficient population and are already content. However, in order to alleviate economic difficulties, we have to return to the colonies. Promoting Trade Policy Reserving Food for Wartime We do not want to ask other countries to adopt Germany's trade plan. We want to buy food and raw materials and sell goods. This is in the interest of other people as well. The ideal of political economists that the value of currency is based on gold reserves is not worth laughing at. In our opinion, the value of the German mark must be based on the working people and the quantity and quality of production. The first way to alleviate Germany's difficulties is to expand its space. It has not yet benefited from kicking it, so Germany must increase its exports. From an economic point of view, it is even more necessary to return Germany's old colonies. It is more important to provide jobs for 7 million unemployed people than to increase their wages. We must export goods in order to purchase food abroad. The German people depend on exports for their livelihood, otherwise we will become starving people. But I can assure you that the German people will live, and their leaders are willing to do everything in their power to manage everything. No Hatred for Britain and France Willing to Coexist Peacefully Hitler resolutely declared that Germany does not hate France or the United States and is willing to coexist peacefully with both countries. We have answered all those who advocate war through German newspapers and informed the German people of their names, such as Cooper Aiden, etc. Taking the Excuse of Overpopulation Anti-Semitism Must Still Be Carried Out Germany currently has 135 people per kilometer and no room to accommodate Jews, while other countries have room. But they all say they cannot allow Jews to live there. If the internationally powerful Jews try to start another great war, the result will not be to destroy Germany, but only to make the entire European Jewish race perish. Will Follow French and American Precedents to Promote the Separation of Politics and Religion Hitler spoke of the church, saying that if the church is not satisfied, the German government is ready to separate politics and religion at any time, just like France and the United States. Germany and Italy Are in Cahoots to Maintain Common Interests Hitler's remarks on reducing armaments stated that from an economic standpoint, it would be prudent to reach a political and colonial compromise with Germany. This is more effective than taking a path that only allows arms manufacturers to reap huge profits while increasing the burden on the people. If foreign politicians threaten us with economic sanctions plans, then I dare to assure them that, if so, it will inevitably trigger an economic war of desperation, and we are easier to carry out than other over-satisfied countries. If Italy is dragged into the vortex of war, Germany will fight shoulder to shoulder with it. This is absolutely certain. Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany will be able to preserve the civilization of Europe. Assisting in the Spanish Civil War to Avoid Falling into Red Hitler said that Germany is now assisting the Spanish Nationalists in order to save Spain from the possibility of Bolshevization. They will save the people and annihilate the political clergy who are the enemies of the people. They will deal with all the enemies of the country. Germany would try to unite the Christian churches, but because of the resistance of a few bishops, it could not do so and abandoned this move. Now only those who advocate war think that there will be war. He himself thinks that there will be a long period of peace in the future. Raise the Issue of Recovering Territory Again Broadly Discuss Foreign Relations In addition to colonies, Germany has no territorial demands on Britain and France. If they say that colonies are worthless, then why are they unwilling to return them to Germany? It is a joke to say that Germany cannot govern its colonies. All opposing arguments are a matter of power and have nothing to do with justice or reason. Without adequate space and some necessary raw materials, the economic survival of the people cannot be maintained. Our relationship with North America is now disturbed by false propaganda. We do not allow Americans to interfere in our German affairs. We have friends in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. We have good trade relations with the Balkan countries. We hope for the stability of Czechoslovakia and hope that the country will not return to the dangerous attitude of former President Benes. Four-Year Economic Plan Will Continue to Be Implemented in the Future Hitler's speech lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes. After the speech, General Goering, the Commissioner for the Four-Year Plan, thanked him. General Goering also thanked Hitler for his hard work in the past six years. Then the members of parliament sang "Germany Above All" and the National Socialist Party song. Hitler's speech will be broadcast by the radio station with a summary translated into English, French, and Italian. Before Hitler's speech, Interior Minister Frick Chuan announced that Germany's four-year self-sufficiency plan will be implemented for another four years. General Goering was unanimously elected as Speaker of the House by the entire House (31st Reuters dispatch). Mussolini Sends a Telegram to Congratulate the German Leader (Berlin) Today is the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently sent a telegram to Hitler, saying, "Since the establishment of the Axis between our two countries, our friendship has been profound and our relationship has been close. This is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. I am delighted to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule." The leader immediately replied with a telegram of thanks, saying, "I am very grateful for your telegram of congratulations. The close friendship between our two countries is further proof of this" (30th Havas dispatch). Chamberlain Delivers a Speech Promoting Anglo-German Cooperation Britain Truly Has Comrades (London) Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that Hitler said in his speech yesterday that the British and German nations are willing to cooperate with each other in a situation of mutual trust. I take this opportunity to reiterate that this sentiment is shared by the British government and people. However, to date, the British and German governments have not considered conducting any negotiations (31st Havas dispatch). Fascist Conference Scheduled to Convene This Saturday Italian Prime Minister Will Make a Statement (Rome) Here, people are paying close attention to and looking forward to the Fascist Conference this Saturday. The conference is the first major conference of the Fascist Party this year. Mussolini will make an important report on several important matters. The so-called important matters include: Chamberlain's visit to Rome, Ciano's visit to southern Hungary, the conquest of Barcelona, and Hitler's speech in the Reichstag (31st Haitong dispatch). German Leader Awards Medals (Berlin) Yesterday, German leader Hitler and Propaganda Minister Goebbels distributed medals to those who received the German National Arts and Sciences Award. This award was established by Hitler to replace the Nobel Prize because Germans are prohibited from accepting the Nobel Prize. Germany once had a man named Ossietzky who, one or two years ago, was in a concentration camp and, although he won the award, was not allowed to accept it. The German National Arts and Sciences Award is worth 800 pounds sterling per award. During the cultural conference held in Nuremberg in September, it was decided who would</p>

<p>Science and Life</p>
<p>Published Foreword by the Shanghai Society of Friends of the China Science Society, Ji Qian</p>
<p>The world today is a world dominated by science. Among all countries in the world that are able to survive and not perish, there is virtually nothing that does not require science. The scope of science is very broad, and the categories are numerous. However, strictly speaking, it can be divided into two major categories:</p>
<p>Natural science, and</p>
<p>Social science. Those that belong to the former include mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology (with meteorology, and geography attached), botany, zoology (with physiology, psychology, etc. attached), and so on. Those that belong to the practical applications include various engineering fields, such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering; there are also architecture, mining, agriculture, forestry, and medicine, which utilize the foundations of pure sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, and geology, and apply them to the utilization and benefit of life. Those that belong to the latter include politics, law, economics, sociology, education, history, and other disciplines. Although not pure science in the strictest sense, they are also based on mathematics, physics, biology, and other sciences, and have a great effect on national welfare and people’s livelihood. Other academic fields not discussed in this article, as long as they contain the nature of science, are all inseparable from the two major categories mentioned above.</p>
<p>The benefits of science to human life are countless. Here, we will discuss the most obvious ones in general terms: such as the vastness of the earth, the great distances between countries, often tens of thousands of miles apart, and the obstruction of high mountains, deep seas, and vast oceans, making mutual contact and communication absolutely impossible in ancient times. Since the development of science, transportation tools have become more and more advanced and refined, with ships, trains, airplanes, wireless telegraphs, and other inventions, which have reduced all the dangers of nature, solved the problem of space, and made transportation around the world as convenient as it is today. The Earth is an infinite treasure trove, and what is contained within it was initially necessary for human life. Ancient people allowed these resources to be buried and wasted, unable to develop and utilize them. In modern times, scientists study the formation of various rocks, observe the types and distribution of ancient organisms, and determine the age and structure of strata; with the development of chemistry and mechanics, they can now excavate and refine gold, silver, coal, iron, gasoline, and other minerals, which are all extracted by mankind. The plains and open fields of the world all have crops growing among them. With the application of biology, physics, chemistry, and other sciences to agriculture, cultivation and harvesting have been gradually improved, and the profits are many times greater than in the past. Industrial raw materials are scattered and abundant throughout the world's waters and lands. With the advancement of biological surveys, geological surveys, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and other fields, organic and inorganic materials can be absorbed and utilized to a great extent, and the precision of manufacturing is constantly improving. Human health and longevity have greatly increased compared to the past due to the progress of medicine and other disciplines. Human clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all been greatly improved due to the development of science. The advantages and disadvantages, beauty and ugliness, of what people can enjoy today compared to what people could enjoy a hundred or decades ago are as different as heaven and earth. There are countless other areas where human life requires science. There is no doubt that humanity relies on science to evolve. Therefore, the nation with the highest level of modern culture must have the most scientific talents and the most prosperous scientific endeavors. However, what our people should pay the most attention to is that science is not only a necessity for human life, but also enables human thinking to be orderly and systematic, conforming to the laws of nature, obtaining a true view of life, and adapting to the environment in one's conduct and actions, making everything appropriate. Individuals become outstanding members, and the whole becomes a superior nation. If the people of a country can be like this, then the education in that country will be particularly developed, the order of society will be extremely stable, the financial resources of the country will be abundant, the strength of national defense will be strong, the politics will be enlightened, and there will be long-term stability and security, without internal worries or external troubles, and the country's fortune will reach its peak, and the people will enjoy the joy of peace. Therefore, science is truly a good medicine for a nation to cure poverty and overcome weakness.</p>
<p>Today, in civilized countries, people cannot live without science for a moment. If our people want to survive in this world and avoid the tragic disaster of inferiority and defeat, in addition to striving to promote science and producing a large number of highly skilled experts to respond to all urgent problems, the general public should also have common sense about science, so that they can use science and benefit from it in their daily lives. Only when the general public in the country, the majority of whom are knowledgeable about common science, can the spirit of society be cultivated and strengthened, and the potential of the nation be strengthened, can the country's destiny be long-lasting. But how can common sense about science be acquired? How can individuals devote themselves to science? The first step is to read ordinary science publications from time to time, as a plan to accumulate gradually and achieve great things. Ordinary scientific common sense, such as those contained in this column, are all simple and easy to understand; people with a little common education can easily understand them without any difficulty. If one can practice it tirelessly and persevere, regarding pure science (such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, geology, etc.) or applied science (such as engineering, agriculture, medicine, and those involving social sciences), when reading regularly, classify them by category, select and extract the essentials, and prepare a common scientific foundation, in order to have a day of integration and understanding. After studying for a while, one can specialize in a field that is of the greatest interest and closest to one's nature, while still reading other fields from time to time, continuing to extract information, striving to understand the general meaning of general science, and having the ability to seek further knowledge in the field that one loves and specializes in, so-called "To know something of everything and to know one thing well." This is the law of learning, and all those who aspire to self-study must not ignore this meaning. If the people of our country can devote themselves to science, and the number of people with common sense about science increases day by day, there will inevitably be scientific experts emerging from among them in the future. Thomas Edison of the United States, in his early days, did not develop an interest because of reading ordinary science publications, and then devote himself to in-depth study, and later become a great inventor unparalleled in the world, whose contribution in applied science has benefited all mankind? This is what the young people of our country who aspire to self-study should take as a model. Moreover, if the people's scientific knowledge is rich, their knowledge and skills will increase, and their thoughts, vision, character, morality, health, and physical strength will improve, and the problem of making a living will be easily solved. This is a superior nation that will not be eliminated by nature, and the progress of society and the strength of the country will naturally become stronger day by day. Today, our people are working hard to strive for survival. Because science was not very developed in our country in the past, we have suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. At this time of serious national crisis, patriots should rise up and catch up, do their best to contribute to the path of saving the country through science, which will surely contribute to the final victory and future construction. The publication of the articles in this column is intended to encourage each other with those who are interested in the country.</p>
<h3>Science and the Wine and Vinegar Industry</h3>
<p>Xin Jun</p>
<p>Louis Pasteur of France wanted to convince people that science is beneficial to industry, can help production, and directly enrich the country and benefit the people. Therefore, he once brought many glass instruments with his assistant, Mr. Cookler, to his hometown of Arbois, to study the diseases of wine, in order to save the endangered wine industry. First, he borrowed an old coffee shop as his laboratory. There was no gas lamp and no running water. He temporarily used a charcoal stove blown by bellows and self-drawn well water. All the equipment was temporarily made by hiring several coppersmiths. Pasteur went to visit many of his old friends and asked them for various wines. Some were sour, some were bitter, some were viscous, and some had turned oily. He knew from experience that winemaking depends on the action of yeast, and he suspected that the spoilage of wine must be caused by another kind of small organism. Sure enough, he looked at these wines one by one under a microscope. In the viscous wine, there was a string of special small organisms. In the bitter wine, there was another kind, and in the spoiled wine, there was yet another kind. Then he invited many people who were in the wine business to show his skills. He told them to bring all kinds of bad wine with strange tastes, and said to them: "I don't need to taste it, I can know what's wrong with your wine." At that time, people naturally didn't believe that he had this kind of ability, but they wanted to make fun of him. They each brought wine. Some deliberately mixed some good wine in it. Little did they know that he saw it all under the microscope. He pointed out the problems of those wines one by one, and even identified the good wine as good. Everyone at the scene was stunned. Their contemptuous attitude changed to admiration. They all said in unison that he was an amazing genius. After everyone dispersed, Pasteur discussed with Mr. Cookler how to deal with these small organisms, so that they would not turn good wine into bad wine. Finally, they invented a method. That is, when the wine is about to be brewed, heat the wine slightly, without boiling it, so that even if there are undesirable microorganisms inside, they will be eliminated, and the wine will not be spoiled. This method is now used for sterilization, and in Western languages, it is called "Pasteurize" after his name.</p>
<p>The people of eastern France learned this method from him and solved their problem of spoiled wine. The people of central France then clamored for him to solve the problem of vinegar making. Pasteur rushed to Tours, France, and used his microscope as his tool in the same way. People told him that there was often a special scum in vinegar, which was a sign of vinegar making. If there is no such scum, wine cannot be turned into vinegar. Sure enough, in less than a few weeks, he researched that these scum were all thousands of small organisms. Finally, he gathered the vinegar merchants together and told them that these microorganisms turn wine into vinegar when they drink it. In a few days, they can produce more than 10,000 times their own weight in vinegar. For example, if a person has a body weighing 101 kilograms, they can chop one million kilograms of wood in four days. Do you think this kind of ability is shocking? However, these small organisms have this ability, so we cannot underestimate the work of microorganisms. Therefore, Pasteur thought of an elephant, a cow, or a person that can be killed by the power of a microorganism. This is not an impossible thing. Before leaving Tours, he helped the vinegar merchants solve the problem of how to cultivate and nurture these vinegar-making microorganisms, so that they can do a good job of making vinegar by adding oxygen to the wine. As a result, Pasteur almost gave the local vinegar merchants a generous gift worth millions of francs.</p>

<h3>What is Coal? How Does it Burn?</h3>
<p>Jing Qing</p>
<p>Coal is one of the many minerals that make up the Earth's crust, and it is produced all over the world. It is usually buried deep underground and must be mined, but in some places, coal can be mined by quarrying.</p>
<p>Coal in coal mines is usually not in lumps but in layers. The thickness of coal seams varies, sometimes only a few inches, sometimes several feet. The two coal seams are separated by rock layers or clay layers, and some are separated by oil shale. In some places, the coal bed is six miles deep from the ground, but the coal seam is not very thick.</p>
<p>To mine coal, a well or deep cave must be dug. Where the coal passes through, tunnels are dug in all directions to dig out the coal, leaving materials to separate the coal layers. The dug coal blocks are lifted to the surface by a crane suspended in the mine. On the one hand, pillars are erected at the excavation site to prevent the top of the coal seam from collapsing.</p>
<p>Geologists tell us that coal is the remains of abundant plants that covered the ground thousands or even millions of years ago, earlier than the birth of mankind. The soil in coal-producing areas was very fertile at that time, the climate was very warm, and trees and weeds grew very tall.</p>
<p>During the process of crustal movement, great changes occurred on the ground. The dry land, which was previously full of trees, gradually sank and became the seabed. Then the river carried sand and weeds down and deposited them on the seabed.</p>
<p>As the sand and weeds piled higher and higher, their enormous weight, plus the heat of the earth, pressed the trees below into solid blocks, which is the coal we mine.</p>
<p>The river constantly raised the sand, and the previous sediment was pressed into stone. We can see the shells and fossils of marine animals in this rock, which proves that the coal bed was once flooded.</p>
<p>In Greenland and northern Canada, there is a place called Baffin Island, where there are two large coalfields, and the coal is produced on the ground and can be dug out with a shovel. The place is extremely cold, and no trees can be seen within three thousand miles nearby. However, explorers have discovered a large forest under the ground, which is well preserved. The direction in which these trees lie down seems as if they were blown by the sea breeze. Even the fruits on the tops of the trees are still fresh. All of this indicates that Baffin Island must have been much warmer at one time than it is now.</p>
<p>Plants, like animals, are composed of four main elements - carbon (charcoal gas), hydrogen (light gas), oxygen (nourishing gas) and nitrogen (light gas). The amount of nitrogen is very small. Leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the air, which is composed of carbon and oxygen. Plants retain the carbon to form the body, and release some of the oxygen back into the air.</p>
<p>Plant roots absorb water and obtain hydrogen from the water, because water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Nitrogen is also absorbed by the roots to nourish the plants.</p>
<p>Since coal has been transformed from decayed plants, we can infer that it is also composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. In the process of decay, it loses most of its oxygen and nitrogen. A pound of ordinary coal contains twelve ounces of carbon, half an ounce of hydrogen, and two ounces of oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
<p>During combustion, carbon and hydrogen emit large amounts of heat. Although hydrogen is much less abundant than carbon in coal, it is equally important, because, weight for weight, nitrogen emits more heat than carbon.</p>
<p>Burning coal requires oxygen. Oxygen is usually supplied by air, because air is composed of gas and nitrogen. Our bodies are constantly burning. We breathe air into the lungs, and the blood absorbs oxygen from the air and distributes it throughout the body so that it comes into contact with tissues. Oxygen is burned to form carbon dioxide, which is sent back to the lungs, where it is exchanged with oxygen and exhaled. Our bodies feel warm because of this combustion, and we also get the ability to act, speak, and think from it.</p>
<p>If we stay in a small, unventilated room, the oxygen will quickly run out, and carbon dioxide will poison us. The same is true for burning coal. Coal must have a constant supply of gas to keep it burning.</p>
<p>When coal is first heated, hydrogen and part of carbon combine into a gas called hydrocarbon. In fact, there are many different gases because hydrocarbons have different compositions. They are important gaseous fuels.</p>
<p>When we sit by the fire and watch the coal emit gas streams, sometimes cracking into flames, we see hydrocarbons. But when the coal is not hot enough, some hydrocarbons do not emit gas, and some condense on the surface of the coal into a waxy substance.</p>
<p>Usually, the temperature of the fire is not enough to ignite this hydrocarbon gas, so black smoke and soot spots occur, which wastes a lot of useful heat. Therefore, coal stoves must have a sufficient supply of air.</p>

<h3>A Bomb with a Driver</h3>
<p>Yuan</p>
<p>Air Force personnel often find it difficult to hit targets when dropping ordinary bombs from high altitudes, because they cannot follow the bombs as they fall and guide them to the correct destination. This problem has been solved. A bomb that can accommodate a driver inside has now been designed. This bomb is launched from an altitude of 10,000 feet and steered by the driver lying inside the bomb, causing it to glide until it is directly over the target object at a distance of approximately 3,500 feet. Then it is allowed to fall straight down, making it easy to hit the target.</p>
<p>What about the driver? He has a parachute on his back, ready to detach from the bomb and land safely before reaching the destination. To avoid the danger of landing in enemy camps, this bomb is now limited to naval warfare. Therefore, a portable rubber boat and sufficient food are specially prepared for him, so that he can float on the water after landing, waiting to be rescued. It is said that this bomb can sink battleships worth 20 million gold pounds, and the driver himself can ride a small boat and triumphantly return. (British Armchair Science)</p>
<h3>World Science News</h3>
<h3>New Invention of Wireless Radio Light</h3>
<p>(New York Times, Dan)</p>
<p>The French Mr. Costel has invented wireless radio wave lighting, which has recently been patented. This new type of light bulb is spherical, without a filament, and the interior is a vacuum coated with phosphorescent or other luminescent powder chemicals. When excited by high-frequency radio waves, it emits bright light. When in use, it is suspended on a line (metal line), and this nickel is used as an antenna for a prototype wireless radio transmitter. From this, we predict that in the future, this type of light bulb may be used to illuminate streets and houses. When used to illuminate streets, the antenna used is a single wire, and when used to illuminate rooms, the antenna can be parallel or fan-shaped.</p>
<h3>Children’s Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>(Soviet Yearbook, Dan)</p>
<p>The "Central Park of Culture and Recreation" in Moscow has a telephone bureau. All the work is done by children. There are 80 lines connecting the houses and institutions in the children's village in the park. There are also 25 telephone receivers set up in various parts of the village, each representing a famous city in a foreign country. The intention is to allow the children to use the telephone for international calls, and to use the language of a certain country when communicating with that country. Fifty skilled members of the Archimedes Society work in the telephone bureau. The society is dedicated to young inventors.</p>
<h3>Artificial Plastics</h3>
<p>(New York Times, Dan)</p>
<p>Four researchers from the U.S. Forest Service have invented the use of sawdust, straw, waste wood, and sugarcane stalks to make useful artificial plastics. The inventors boil any of these wastes in water and dye under steam pressure, resulting in a hard, heavy, black, and shiny glass-like material that has a high resistance to water and moisture. This material is an excellent electrical insulator and can be used to make buttons, door knobs, and car handles, and base plates for nickel electrical appliances. The manufacturing process of this plastic is very simple, requiring only three hours of cooking. It contains 85% to 95% of the original waste. After the generated compound is dried, it is ground into powder. If heat is applied and a pressure of 1,500 to 3,500 pounds is applied, the powder can be molded into artificial resin.</p>
<h3>Ancient Seeds Can Still Germinate Today</h3>
<p>(American Science Communication, Yuan)</p>
<p>Several seeds of the oriental red lotus, which have been buried for three to five hundred years, were successfully germinated after proper treatment by the Chicago Field Museum. These seeds were obtained from South Manchuria by Professor Wugge, who excavated them from the bottom of an ancient well, which was formerly the bottom of a lake. The seeds were buried inside. There is a willow tree with a diameter of four feet on the ground where the seeds were found. A similar smaller willow tree was cut down and counted to have 125 growth rings. Therefore, the professor concluded that the seeds must have been buried for three to five hundred years. After he tried planting the seeds, he found that they could still flourish.</p>

<h3>All Properties of Chinese Shipyards Occupied by Japanese</h3>
<p>Ten shipyards along the Huangpu River Important machinery removed</p>
<p>Except for the Jiangnan Shipyard, which is state-owned, all other shipyards in this city (excluding foreign-owned) are commercially operated. After the war, all of them were occupied by the Japanese, resulting in extremely heavy losses. Unexpectedly, the Japanese recently moved the machinery from various factories to the vicinity of Taitong Warehouse in Lujiazui and handed them over to the Japanese company Nisshin to start the Nisshin Shipyard. Chinese business owners have no way to consult. The details of the investigation are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Ten factories before the war</p>
<p>According to the investigation, among the Chinese-owned iron factories, those with a larger scale and specializing in repairing and building ships totaled ten before the war. They were distributed on both the east and west banks of the Huangpu River. Their names and addresses are as follows:</p>
<p>Laogongmao, located in Bailianjing, Pudong</p>
<p>Sanbei, located in Rihui Port, Nanshi (formerly operated by Sanbei Shipping Company)</p>
<p>Dazhonghua, located at the bottom of Yangshupu Dinghai Bridge</p>
<p>Hongchang, located at the southern end of Xuejia浜, Nanshi</p>
<p>Taixing, located next to Hongchang Factory, Nanshi</p>
<p>Caili, located at Chunjiang Pier, Lujiazui, Pudong</p>
<p>Longchang, located in Lujiazui, Pudong</p>
<p>Hengchangxiang, same as above</p>
<p>Hongxiangxing, same as above</p>
<p>China Merchants Inland River Factory, same as above</p>
<p>All of the above factories are of considerable size.</p>
<p>Two factories requisitioned for military use after occupation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied the suburbs of Shanghai, the above-mentioned factories have all been occupied by force. Several soldiers were stationed in each factory, and no one from the factory was allowed to enter. Last year, Laogongmao in Pudong and Dazhonghua at Dinghai Bridge, which were larger in scale, were organized and recruited a large number of ignorant Chinese workers to work for them. Laogongmao was under the management of the Japanese Navy, specializing in repairing small vessels such as naval speedboats. Dazhonghua was under the management of the Japanese Army, specializing in repairing damaged guns, artillery, ironclad vehicles, and other weapons.</p>
<p>Nisshin occupies machinery from five factories</p>
<p>Recently, in order to develop its own commercially operated Nisshin Shipping Company, the Japanese designated vacant land near Taitong Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong, to be handed over to the company to start the Nisshin Shipyard, so that workers could be hired to start business. All the machinery, such as motors, lathes, and shears, were moved from Caili, Longchang, Hengchangxiang, Hongxiangxing, and China Merchants Inland River Factory in Lujiazui. Ignorant foremen were used to recruit Chinese workers to repair and build ships. Once preparations are complete, work will begin soon.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi takes over Jiangnan Shipyard</p>
<p>The state-owned Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, was reorganized by the Japanese earlier. All the machinery used to repair and build ships, except for a part that was abandoned when the national army moved west, was completely moved from the Sanbei, Hongchang, Hexing, and three commercially operated iron factories in Nanshi to Jiangnan Shipyard for use. The factory was also completely allocated to the Japanese Mitsubishi Shipping Company by the Japanese authorities and renamed Mitsubishi Shipyard, sharing the limelight with Nisshin. All the shipbuilding factories and heavy industry owned by Chinese in Shanghai have completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Surviving Crew Members Describe Dangerous Situation</h3>
<p>Hit a reef due to dark weather Fortunately, fishing boats came to the rescue</p>
<p>The news that the crew of the Kaibo ship, which hit a reef and sank in the Diaoban sea area outside Haimen, were rescued, and part of the crew had returned to Shanghai, while the shipowner and 20 others remained in Taiwan waiting for the ship to return to Shanghai, has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at about 4 p.m., the shipowner led the crew members back to Shanghai on the Far East Company's Hana ship, and then went to the relevant parties to report the details of the accident. After the crew members reported to the company, they rushed back to their residences to reassure their families.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter met with the crew members who returned to Shanghai on the ship and heard a very detailed account of the accident and rescue. According to them, on the 23rd of last month, the Kaibo ship left Shanghai with a full load of coal for Ningbo. At 9 a.m. on the 24th, it arrived outside Wenzhou Port and anchored. As usual, it had to clear customs with the Wenzhou Customs. It then left Wenzhou at 9:30 p.m. that night and set sail for Ningbo. The sky was dark that night, and it was impossible to see one's fingers.</p>
<p>It was difficult to distinguish even things nearby. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 a.m. (on the morning of the 25th), when sailing in the Diaoban sea area outside of , they suddenly heard a loud crash and the whole ship shook. They knew that a major accident had occurred. Upon closer inspection, the hull had hit a reef, and seawater immediately flooded in. The ship urgently sent a telegram for help, and the sound was pulled back, and the hull gradually sank. Nearby fishing boats rushed to the ship to rescue the crew. The shipowner ordered the compradors and other crew members to disembark first, and finally</p>
<p>The shipowner led the chief mate, second mate, third mate, and the crew members who came with him today to disembark. The large ship also sank at that time. At 10 a.m. the next morning (the 25th), they landed at Xi'ao, which belongs to Wenling County. After having lunch there, they were led by the villagers to Daliang Township and reported to the township chief, Chen Sidao. Mr. Chen was honest and kind, but he was very anxious because the whereabouts of the compradors who had left the ship earlier were unknown.</p>
<p>Very anxious Chen then ordered people to investigate and learned that 49 people had already passed through the border and were advancing. Everyone was relieved. They were entertained by Mr. Chen and stayed overnight. Because the area prohibited able-bodied men from leaving the border, they were issued a document to accompany them to Wenling County. First, they went to the Township Joint Office, and then a representative from the office accompanied them to the county government to prove their identity and obtain passports. They took an inland small boat to Luqiao, about 90 miles away.</p>
<p>Luqiao changed ships to Haidou, which was fifty miles away. They arrived at Haimen on the evening of the 27th. Because the hotels were full and there was no place to stay, they were specially permitted by the owner of the Hana ship, and they stayed on the Hana ship. Yesterday (the 30th), they came to Shanghai from Haidou, and finally arrived at the port at 4:45 p.m. today, stopping at the Roosevelt Pier on the Bund of the French Concession. It can be said that it was a great fortune in misfortune.</p>
<h3>Haida and Hafa Ships Released One After the Other Have Sailed to Shanghai from Qingdao</h3>
<p>All three ships were searched and silver coins were confiscated. The Japanese falsely claimed that they were aiding the Chinese army, but the foreign merchants firmly denied it. The British adopted a tough stance and insisted on continuing to sail to Fuyu. The Haida, Yongzhen, and Hafa foreign ships were hijacked by Japanese warships to Qingdao a few days ago at Yanghekou. After negotiations by the British Consulate, Yongzhen has been released first and will arrive in Shanghai this morning. The Haida and Hafa ships have also been released one after another and left Qingdao for Shanghai yesterday morning at 11 a.m. However, all three ships were searched in Qingdao, and the silver and legal tender loaded on board were confiscated. The Shanghai-Japanese naval authorities even claimed that the three ships were aiding guerrillas, but the foreign merchants firmly denied it. The Shanghai-Fuyu route will continue to operate after the three ships arrive in Shanghai. The details are as follows, according to a reporter from Modern News Agency.</p>
<p>Haida and Hafa released at the same time</p>
<p>The British Yongzhen and Norwegian Haida and Hafa, etc., were forcibly hijacked by Japanese warships and Qingdao Customs patrol ships near Yanghekou in Haizhou at about 9 a.m. on the 27th of last month and sailed to Qingdao. After the British and Norwegian consuls telegraphed the consuls in Qingdao, the Yongzhen ship was released the day before yesterday and sailed directly to Shanghai under the protection of the British warship Haynamma, and will arrive in port this morning. Yesterday, the Norwegian Consulate in this city received a telegram stating that after the Norwegian Consulate in Qingdao continued to protest, the Haida and Hafa ships were also released one after another and set sail for Shanghai at the same time yesterday morning after adding coal in Qingdao, and are expected to arrive in port in the next few days.</p>
<p>Silver and legal tender on three ships confiscated</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Modern News Agency learned from the companies of the ships that the shipowner of the Haida ship, Norwegian Mr. Peter, telegraphed from the ship that after the Haida and other ships arrived in Qingdao, they were illegally searched by the Japanese and the silver coins (mostly hard currency) and legal tender loaded on board from Fuyu to Shanghai were confiscated. Although the British and Norwegian consuls negotiated, the Japanese actually confiscated all the silver coins. As for the legal tender, it will be returned after verification.</p>
<p>The Japanese falsely claimed to aid the Chinese army</p>
<p>It was also learned that the spokesman of the Japanese naval authorities in this city stated to foreign reporters the night before last regarding the detention of the three foreign ships, falsely claiming that the three foreign ships were transporting kerosene and other military supplies from Shanghai to Fuyu, unloading them onto sailing boats, and transferring them to the mainland to aid the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, the Qingdao Customs authorities impounded them. However, the British and Norwegian shipping companies absolutely denied this and believed that this illegal move by the Japanese was obviously to squeeze the rights and interests of foreign expatriates and attempt to monopolize shipping in various ports. This decision was made after the ships were severely searched and suffered considerable business losses. Therefore, they decided to ask their governments to seriously negotiate to stop the barbaric behavior of the Japanese in order to protect the interests of foreign expatriates in China.</p>
<p>British merchants advocate continuing to sail to Fuyu and Ning</p>
<p>The British Kailin Mala ship loaded cargo and sailed to Fuyu from Shanghai on the 28th. Because it was blocked by Japanese warships outside Yanghekou, it was forced to return to the original ship. It arrived in Shanghai at 10 a.m. yesterday. It is now known that the owner of the ship, British Mr. Maller, is extremely indignant at the illegal obstruction by the Japanese and believes that the shipping rights of British expatriates cannot be destroyed by the Japanese. Therefore, he advocated that the Kailin ship should ask for the protection of British warships again and continue to sail to Fuyu. However, in order to avoid accidental losses, the customers who entrusted the cargo all advocated that after the Yongzhen, Haida, Hafa and other ships arrived in Shanghai, they would inquire about the details before discussing and deciding whether to continue sailing.</p>
<h3>Tonghai Troops Severely Damage Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese army at Sanyu Town was annihilated. More than 80 no one survived</p>
<p>According to a guest from Nantong, guerrilla warfare in Tonghai counties has occurred from time to time in the past six months, but there have been no significant gains or losses for either side. This is because the troops in the two counties are local strong men who have not been rigorously trained and lack sophisticated weapons. In addition, the officers' command is ineffective, so it is difficult to achieve results in combat. Until recently, in a battle in Sanyu Town, Tong, more than 100 Japanese troops</p>
<p>The entire army was annihilated, which made the people very happy. Recalling that since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Haimen and Sanxian City Qinglong Port three months ago, they immediately repaired the Tonghai South Main Road and stationed troops in various towns along the road. Since the various troops did not resist, the Japanese army entered</p>
<p>No man's land. People in the two counties were heartbroken. In order to recover the lost land, the Jiangsu Provincial Government first dismissed Magistrate Wei of Haimen and appointed Sun Xinfu, the brigade commander of the ×× Brigade of the ×× Group Army, to take over. After being appointed, Mr. Sun led his team south, first resolving all the land boats and battalions in Qidong within ten days, and then starting to reorganize the military discipline of the various battalions</p>
<p>Appeasing the local area, he recently built fortifications in the Sanyu Town area in preparation for an ambush. The Japanese army did indeed depart from Si Jiaba at 7 a.m. on the 22nd with more than 80 people in seven cars and advanced towards Sanyu Town. The villagers saw the Japanese army swarming in and rushed to avoid them. Mr. Sun made preparations early and calmly waited for the Japanese army to approach the defense line and swept them with dense machine guns. The Japanese army was caught off guard and collapsed. At the same time, a certain battalion commander supervised the team to pursue them from the Beixing Bridge. Within two hours, the Japanese army</p>
<p>All were killed in battle, and the Chinese army only suffered a few casualties while waiting for work. Since this battle, the Japanese army has been a little restrained and no longer as arrogant as before. It is heard that Mr. Sun graduated from Huangpu and participated in the Battle of Shanghai on January 28. He is extremely brave. This time, he won a victory, and the people of the two counties were all grateful.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Foreign Trade Local Products Concentrated in Kunming for Export The area is the only main channel to foreign countries. Main local product exports gradually increase</h3>
<p>After the Trade Committee of the Ministry of Finance adjusted foreign trade, it has been making every effort to encourage local products, increase production to promote foreign sales, and unite with the China Vegetable Oil Company, the Central Trust Bureau, the China Tea Company, etc. to purchase the country's main export local products, such as silk, tea, tung oil, hog bristles, medicinal materials, mineral sand, etc. For goods exported and sold in foreign exchange, taxes are exempted. Since implementation, it has been quite effective. The entire trade has gradually improved, and the number of import surpluses has gradually decreased. The Ministry of Finance has increased the fund for the association, totaling 80 million yuan in national currency. In the past, the export of local products was concentrated in Hong Kong, but now it has been decided to concentrate in Kunming, because Kunming is the only main channel to foreign countries in the northwest. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs to Hanoi in French Indochina, the Yunnan-Burma Highway runs to British Burma, the Kunming-Sichuan Railway is under active construction, and the Kunming Commodity Inspection Bureau has been established. The Kunming branches of the China-China Communications and Agriculture Bank and various commercial banks have also been established one after another. Also, the export of local products last year was 76,264,158 yuan, the export of local products the previous year was 82,825,575 yuan, and the export of local products in 1936 was 70,574,142 yuan. The export of local products last year increased compared to 1936,</p>
<p>It decreased in 1937, but the export amount of main local products did not decrease.</p>
<h3>The Pastor Was Killed in the Japanese-Occupied Area of North China</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that yesterday (30th) it was learned from Qingdao that the Belgian Catholic Church pastor Dan Gelo and his Chinese church members in Xincheng (transliteration) of Suiyuan were all killed in the Yilaigai (transliteration) area between Baotou and Guihua. The area is within the Japanese-occupied area.</p>
<h3>Banned Items for Aiding the Enemy May Be Purchased by the Government to Avoid Obstructing Sales and Affecting Livelihoods The Ministry of Economy has stipulated remedial measures</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated 54 items, such as tung oil, tea, and silk, as items prohibited from being transported to the enemy in accordance with the regulations on banning items for aiding the enemy, it has been approved by the Executive Yuan for record. Local customs offices and local competent authorities close to the war zone have been ordered to prohibit transportation. The Ningxian Chamber of Commerce in Zhejiang, etc., requested a postponement of implementation because tung oil, local paper, etc. are the main products of the area. Fortunately, the Ministry of Economic Affairs</p>

<p>Business News and Securities</p>
<p>Daily Report</p>
<p>There Were Two Market Prices for Public Bonds in One Day</p>
<p>Interest Included in the Morning, Interest Excluded in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Market Waits to See What Happens After February 10th</p>
<p>Securities in the Black Market: Yesterday's market conditions were slightly chaotic. Generally, the morning prices included interest, while the afternoon prices excluded interest. This type of approach was unprecedented and should be considered innovative. It's also a unique phenomenon of the current spot market activity. Selling was prevalent in the morning, as naturally people were willing to cash out their profits and avoid the hassle of receiving payments in six-month installments. This also reveals the general sense of uncertainty among the public. Based on this, the public outrage and the fierceness of the price surge, as well as the severity of the decline, all happened within a month and a half. The market has returned to the same sluggishness as before December 12th of last year, even worse. The price surge gradually started on December 12th and continued until January 10th of this year, experiencing a flying leap and rising by ten yuan. After January 10th, the market gradually turned bearish, with the decline becoming increasingly severe, even more so than the increase. By yesterday, it had fallen by more than ten yuan again. This back-and-forth movement suggests the presence of manipulators, causing speculators to become wary and hesitant. This situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. Yesterday's trading seemed stagnant, with a significant decrease in transactions. The market price was interest-inclusive in the morning and interest-exclusive in the afternoon. Because major players were observing, retail investors, although slightly interested, were not enthusiastic. Major sellers were Dakangcheng and Dafenghao, but their sales were limited. Market prices fluctuated within a range of ten to twenty cents, roughly similar to the previous day's market. The afternoon market excluded interest, with prices generally reduced by one yuan and seventy or eighty cents. Normally, this would only be reduced by two and a half yuan, so the market still appeared weak. A more standard market price is expected to emerge after the Type A lottery on February 10th. Currently, the situation is still chaotic. The total transaction volume for the day was only over 300,000 yuan. There were no transactions for Type D and 96 bonds. The interest-inclusive and interest-exclusive prices for the morning and afternoon are listed below.</p>
<p>Interest Included in the Morning, Interest Excluded in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: More than 80 shares of Nanshi Huashang Electric Company were traded at a price of 5.05 yuan, slightly higher by one cent than before.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt Market Prices on January 30th (Monday): Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation and a few railway bonds saw slight declines, falling by half a pound to one pound. Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation Bonds issued in England continued to fall by half a pound, with a price of 46 pounds, the lowest price for this month. Daqing Railway Bonds fell by one pound, with a price of 22 pounds. The Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at 21.5 pounds and the latter at 18 pounds. Anglo-Gold Rehabilitation Bonds issued in France had an asking price of 44 pounds and a selling price of 45.5 pounds. The supply of Anglo-French-American 5% bonds in the spot market was quite strong, with a position of 10,000 pounds (equivalent to 50,000 US dollars) sold at a price of 67 pounds, one pound lower than the market price, but 1.5 pounds lower than the sales price a few days ago. Therefore, sellers are very cautious and have no intention of selling further. Furthermore, 3,000 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds were sold at a price of 18 pounds, 7 shillings and 6 pence, 7 shillings and 6 pence higher than the market price. Continued issuance of Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bonds issued in England amounted to 1,000 pounds and was sold at a price of 16 pounds. Another 1,000 pounds of winning tickets were also sold for 16 pounds, at the same market price. The current market sentiment remains weak, and it is feared that it will be difficult to recover in the short term if there are no special developments.</p>
<p>London Market Prices of Stocks of British Far East Companies on January 30th (Monday): Only bank stocks saw a slight increase, with Mercantile Bank shares rising by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 8 pounds, 17 shillings and 6 pence. HSBC shares each rose by half a pound. The price of shares registered in England was 82.5 pounds, and the price of shares registered in Hong Kong was 84.5 pounds. There were no other changes. Stop selling and wait and see, so the price immediately rebounded. The Qian-Dui-Ye Jin-Hao sold 50 taels at a price of 16 yuan. Later, Qian-Dui-Ye did another 50 taels among themselves at a price of 17 yuan. By this time it was 11:40 am. Later, someone still offered to buy at 17 yuan, but the seller wanted 18 yuan before they would supply, so the deal did not go through. Therefore, the noon close was still 17 yuan. At the beginning of the afternoon, due to news that foreign exchange had been manipulated by foreign firms, it gradually returned to normal, so sellers were scarce, and the price was raised to the border of 20 yuan. At 2:45 pm, Yu Hao did another 50 taels among themselves at a price of 19 yuan. After that, a certain Qian-Dui-Ye suddenly came to sell, but buyers were all watching and waiting. The selling price dropped directly to 17 yuan but still no deal went through, so the late closing price was still 2019 yuan, which was 1 yuan lower than the previous day. The spot gold of Xianjin Hao was sold at a price of 2030 yuan and bought in at 2015 yuan. The current bid price is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>Sugar Is Almost Entirely in the Hands of the Japanese</p>
<p>Imported Japanese Sugar...Enjoys a Uniquely Low Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Planned Shutdown of Minghua...Is About to Resume Operations</p>
<p>It Is Fortunate That Dutch Sugar Will Eventually Retreat</p>
<p>Sugar imports are transported in large quantities every year before the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Lunar New Year. Since August 13th, smuggled sugar has been abundant, and Dutch, Cuban, and Taikoo sugars have been greatly affected. In May of last year, after negotiations with various countries, the sugar tariff was revised, and smuggled sugar temporarily decreased. Unexpectedly, between August and September, the previous state was restored. Recently, a certain party has come up with a clever taxation method: the sugar is first shipped to Xiamen (which has been occupied by the Japanese army, and the customs are also supported by the Japanese), and taxes are paid at the Xiamen Customs, as reported in this newspaper, and then shipped to Shanghai without paying taxes again. However, the import tax at Xiamen Customs (paid in Japanese yen) is more than 9 yuan per metric ton, while the Shanghai Customs requires more than 13 yuan per metric ton. Therefore, it is calculated that paying taxes in Xiamen can save more than 3.60 yuan per metric ton compared to paying taxes in Shanghai. Therefore, in the past month, more than 20,000 bags of this low-tax sugar have been imported, causing the Dutch ships that imported sugar a few days ago to disappear, only carrying 26,180+ bags of beeswax, 2,290 bags of raw starch, 4,650 pieces of coconut shells (raw materials for soap), and 1,300+ pieces of rubber. If this continues, Dutch sugar will surely disappear. It is said that a certain party has also raised this matter for negotiation and is preparing remedial measures, but it is feared that they will be ineffective. (Zu)</p>
<p>The sugar market continued its weak trend yesterday. The association’s closing price for spot Dutch coarse white sugar fell by another one cent, quoted at 24 yuan, 24.20 yuan for goods from this warehouse, 24.40 yuan bid by Da Jinqian, and 15.80 yuan bid for re-exported Dutch coarse white sugar, initially quoted at the original price, but also dropped by one cent later, with few buyers. Due to the association with Lianyingchu, the price of Dutch red sugar remained stable, with spot goods at 16.60 yuan and re-exported goods at 11 yuan, with 100 bags sold. Taikoo car white sugar fell by 1.75 cents, with B Mark East Warehouse delivery at 23.525 yuan, with 50 bags sold, determined as 23.45 yuan for CW Mark, 23.40 yuan for CX Mark, 23.35 yuan for DY Mark, and 23.30 yuan for HX Mark. It is heard that the plan to resume operations at the Minghua Japanese Sugar Factory will be realized in the short term. As of the other day, 9,000 bags of raw sugar have been shipped to Shanghai, indicating that the resumption of operations will not be far off. If so, foreign sugar may undergo further changes. Only Chao Bang opened 80 bags of Shantou cotton red sugar for national sugar, priced at 15.45 yuan, with other scattered transactions, with little price fluctuation.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>Changes Remain Small</p>
<p>Cash Falls First, Then Recovers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the dark market situation of cash sterling continued to trend flat and weak. The situation fell first and then rose. Initially, news that foreign exchange had been sold off by foreign telegrams caused it to loosen slightly, and securities dealers suddenly came to sell off. In addition, a certain money exchange dealer who had previously acted on behalf of Tianjin dealers and went long also came to dump, causing the price to fall to a low of 2014 yuan at one point. However, relying on the silver store dealers buying in on the dip, and money exchange dealers also following suit to scoop up, it immediately rebounded and rose, eventually falling by one yuan. Sentiment in all quarters is downward, and trading is not active. Gold ornaments in silver stores still have not changed. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold have repeatedly declined.</p>
<p>Dark Market for Sterling Down 1 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial selling price for each tael (ten liang) was 2020 yuan, but no deal was seen. It was not until 9:45 that securities dealers sold 50 taels to money exchange dealers at a price of 2018 yuan, which was the opening price. Subsequently, at the same price, a certain money exchange dealer sold 100 taels to the same industry on behalf of Tianjin dealers. At that time, it was suddenly heard that foreign exchange had loosened slightly after being dumped by foreign telegrams, causing buyers to wait and see, and the price gradually declined. A certain money exchange dealer then sold 50 taels to the same industry at a price of 15 yuan. At the same price, another 100 taels were sold to silver store dealers. Later, silver store dealers did another 50 taels among themselves at a price of 15 yuan. Before long, a certain money exchange dealer suddenly came to buy 30 taels from the same industry at a price of 14 yuan. At that time, because a certain money exchange dealer had run out of money, no deals were made.</p>
<p>Prices of Gold Ornaments Have Not Changed</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold ornaments in silver stores still has not changed. Datonghang and Laoqingyun are still quoting the original price of 205 yuan, and Xinhanghang is quoting 203 yuan for selling and 197 yuan for buying.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Suddenly Drops by 1 Penny</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 30th, the price of British pure gold suddenly dropped by one penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 7.5 pence, causing the Bank of China's cash purchase price to also fall to 1213.3 yuan. The posted Customs gold price also fell by 2 cents, reaching 2.397 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 7 cents, reaching 1208.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Exchange Market Fluctuates Slightly</p>
<p>Foreign Telegrams Sell, Foreign Firms Buy</p>
<p>Process Goes from Loose to Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market situation was such that British and American exchange rates were flat for the UK and long for the US, causing the situation to become tight for the UK and flat for the US. However, there were slight fluctuations in the middle. The process was generally loose first and then tight, mainly because foreign telegrams were flooding in, and foreign firms were buying aggressively. Trading was not frequent. The absorption of Hong Kong exchange by foreign banks was not good, and money exchange dealers and others continued to sell, so the underlying trend continued to loosen.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the spread between London's long and short positions narrowed, the price of silver in New York remained unchanged, and the price of raw gold in London narrowed by one penny. There were no changes in exchange rates between the UK and the US, France, and Shanghai. The US dollar rose by 0.375 against the pound, also rose by 0.375 against the French franc, and rose by 0.02 against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's early morning spot selling prices were 8.328125 pence for the pound and 16.28125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the pound was tighter by 0.03125, and the US dollar was unchanged. After the opening, although the bank bought pounds at 8.34375 pence and US dollars at 16.28125 yuan, because other foreign banks such as Huabi and Anda Youli had sell orders, there was no change. HSBC announced that the exchange rate would not change, and the silver balancing tax would be reduced by 0.075. After that, foreign telegrams sold HSBC, Mercantile, Huabi, and British gold at 8.359375 pence, and also sold US exchange to Huabi, Dutch, and American banks at 16.3125 yuan. In addition, money exchange dealers also sold Hong Kong exchange to Dutch banks at 56.125 yuan, causing the underlying trend to tighten slightly. The bank's closing selling prices at noon were slightly looser than the morning opening, at 8.359375 pence for British gold and 16.3125 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>Although banks such as Anda and Huayi competed to absorb Hong Kong exchange at 56.125 yuan in the afternoon market, because money exchange dealers still had intentions to sell, and the intention to sell foreign telegrams had not subsided, the process was slightly looser. Finally, foreign firms came to settle and buy HSBC, Mercantile, and British gold at 8.34375 pence, and US exchange at 16.28125 yuan, so the situation turned slightly tighter. By the evening close, the bank's selling prices were 8.34375 pence for British exchange and 16.28125 yuan for US exchange. As a result, the pound was tighter by 0.015625 compared to the previous close, while the US dollar was flat. Hong Kong exchange was slightly firmer by 0.025.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Comes Out,</p>
<p>Prices Mostly Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, British gold fell by one penny, and the British-US exchange rate fell by 0.375. The settlement of foreign exchange was still strong, and banks supplied readily. Because exchange rates loosened, there were also many people hoarding, so the price was not easy to see weaken. Transactions in the association were slightly active. Chen Tai sold British gold notes for 100 pounds to Qin Tai, and Hui Tong sold British gold notes for 30 pounds to Qin Tai. Hong Tai sold British gold notes for 50 pounds to Qin Tai, and Li Tong sold US gold notes for 500 yuan to Cheng Tai, and also sold US gold notes for 200 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds decrease by 0.1 yuan, British gold notes increase by 0.08 yuan, US gold pounds decrease by 0.2 yuan, US gold notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, Hong Kong notes decrease by 0.01 yuan, Singapore notes decrease by 0.01 yuan, Dutch notes decrease by 0.05 yuan, Robbie notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, Canadian notes decrease by 0.03 yuan, Philippine notes decrease by 0.02 yuan, German gold notes decrease by 0.2 yuan, and Australian gold notes increase by 0.2 yuan. Only the prices of French francs, Annam, Italian, and Siamese notes did not change.</p>
<p>The Spread Narrows Again,</p>
<p>Indian Silver Rises Slightly</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 30th, speculators and the public sold off, and there was a lack of support. The market was still flat. Buyers bought at the listed price, and sellers were mostly waiting to see. The spread between near and far futures for silver narrowed by 0.0125. According to a New York silver telegram, the price of American silver was still undetermined. Also, according to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, and spot and near and far futures all rose by one anna.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Rises Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts fluctuated around 37 yuan per thousand. In the afternoon, it was 36.75 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 37 yuan, slightly higher by 0.025 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yarn and Fabric</p>
<p>Customer Sales Are Less Than 200 Bales</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Decline Gradually</p>
<p>Bearish Squeeze on Japanese Yarn Has Been Settled</p>
<p>Spot Prices Plunge by Six to Seven Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is still generally sluggish, with slow customer sales. This is mainly because the accounting period is approaching, and customers are all preparing funds, so they are temporarily reducing the scope of their purchases, resulting in actual transactions being as sluggish as usual. At the same time, because hoarding households have been actively scooping up for several days, they seem to have reached their fill, and transactions on the market have become less active and less lively than before. As for the intentions of the industry, most are still watching for higher prices, but because the base price is too expensive, coupled with the increasingly tight situation in North China and the Beihai region, the demand for cotton yarn has also become weak. In the Zhejiang region, because the authorities do not allow large amounts of silver to be remitted out, the funds available to customer merchants are becoming smaller, resulting in business coming to a standstill.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot yarn market situation: At the beginning of the morning market, industry members gathered to discuss, but most did not have actual purchasing needs. It was not until around 10:00 that no market price was made. Then, floating households sold on the market, opening slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 395.5 yuan. After that, prices gradually declined. In addition, many retail investors rushed to sell, and hoarding households also remained motionless, and the momentum was very weak. The lowest price for Double Horse yarn was 392 yuan. At the close, a certain industry member came to buy two to three hundred bales of Double Horse warehouse receipts, and the price of Double Horse yarn rebounded to 393 yuan. As a result, statistics showed that a total of 785 bales were transacted in the morning, with customer merchants transacting less than 200 bales. Manufacturers took no action. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was down 3 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Earth was down 3 yuan, Special Jincheng was down 4 yuan, and Tiannv was down 2 yuan. There were no transactions for 10-count and 16-count yarn. Today, 210 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, over 100 pieces to Beihai, and 315 pieces to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each gang is recorded below:</p>
<p>In the Japanese yarn market, the bearish squeeze on this month's skin ball transactions has been resolved peacefully, and it has come to an end. People's minds are agitated, and apart from Tianjin's strong sales, other regions remain as sluggish as usual, so the spot price of yarn has plummeted by six to seven yuan. The spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 324 yuan to 322 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 328 yuan to 327 yuan, a significant drop compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>160,000 Bales of Yao Cloth</p>
<p>Are Blocked in Eastern Zhejiang and Cannot Be Shipped Out</p>
<p>Local Yarn Factories Are Requesting Release for Shipment</p>
<p>The cotton business is becoming increasingly depressed, and all parties have no purchasing intentions, while selling prices remain stubbornly high, so the market is also stagnant and lifeless. Factories are mostly replenishing with foreign cotton, as prices are cheap and the quota can be absorbed in bulk. However, all sources are still lacking, so the future of the cotton market is difficult to predict. Judging from the current situation, inventory is weak, and market prices are also difficult to decline. Also, news that the source of Yao cotton is still blocked, and it is said that 160,000 bales cannot be shipped out. Most of this cotton has been sold to local yarn factories, and they are currently requesting the authorities to approve its release for shipment. Dock arrivals include 766 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 350 pieces of Beisha cotton, and 280 pieces from Qiya. The current cotton transaction volume and market prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Most Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Made by Japanese Factories</p>
<p>American Cotton Prices Are Falling for Near-Term and Rising for Far-Term Due to Sales Issues</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market price: The market is rife with rumors that the US government will propose lending 4 million bales of cotton within days for dumping overseas, causing panic. However, after Senator Peng Hai's strong rejection, sentiment suddenly became firm. However, the sale of the government's 11 million bales of loan cotton is inevitable, but it is not known what method will be used. Most traders in the market believe that near-term cotton prices will decline, so they are all selling near-term cotton and buying far-term cotton, especially March contracts. Therefore, yesterday, near-term cotton prices in New York fell by 0.09 pounds, while far-term prices rose by 0.08 pounds. Spot cotton transactions are sluggish, and factories are temporarily reporting a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by another 1 rupee. Egyptian cotton was closed. Yesterday's exchange rates did not fluctuate much. Converting to legal tender, cotton prices rose and fell. American and Brazilian cotton each fell by 0.075 yuan per dan, Indian cotton fell by 0.06 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 0.065 yuan.</p>
<p>Local Foreign Cotton Transactions: Various factories have been actively purchasing foreign cotton, and arrivals have been numerous in recent days. Currently, the US government's sale of loan cotton has a significant impact on the cotton market. Factories believe that the cotton market will be weak in the short term, so they are waiting to see how the world cotton market develops before deciding on their cotton purchasing strategy. Moreover, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and factories' purchases of foreign cotton have not been as enthusiastic as they were several weeks ago. Yesterday, Shui An purchased 1,000 bales of American cotton and 500 bales of Indian cotton. Other factories were quiet. The transaction volume and prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Fabrics</p>
<p>Also Levy Refugee Relief Donations</p>
<p>Since the Cotton Yarn Industry Association began raising funds for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, it has achieved excellent results. It is heard that the Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory, a British firm in this port, has expressed great sympathy for the refugees in deep distress in our country. Starting from October, they have voluntarily joined in, paying refugee relief donations at the same rate as Chinese factories, with the factory contributing 0.25 yuan per bale of cotton yarn and 0.25 yuan for every 40 pieces of cotton cloth. It is found that the factory has a large scale and produces a very large quantity of yarn and cloth each year, which fully demonstrates the close relationship between China and Britain. The popularity of its products in society is naturally expected.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Current Flour Supply Is Lacking</p>
<p>Wheat Prices Remain High</p>
<p>There are not many flour market transactions. Since the rumor of the liquidation of the large Beiyang gang spread, other scattered gangs have had no wholesale appetite. The Nanyang gang also allocates shipments based on ship positions, and factories have insufficient flour in stock. After delivering goods daily, they are even facing a shortage of spot supply, so the total daily transactions remain as dull as before, with a total of just over 10,000 bags for local and out-of-town merchants. The price of No. 2 flour from the factory remains at 4.8 yuan. It is found that 4,600 pieces of flour were shipped to Shantou today.</p>
<p>Wheat Market: Since prices rose once the other day, sellers have not yet shipped the second batch of foreign wheat, and they are still unwilling to loosen prices, and factories' purchasing appetite is also not very strong, so the transaction volume has not increased. High-quality goods are holding their original prices, and medium-quality goods are seeing slight tightening. A total of 3,500 bags of wheat from Wuhu, Jiangbei, Puzhen, Chuzhou, etc. were sold on the market, of which 2,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin Factory and 1,000 bags by Fufeng Factory. The highest price was still 6.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Change Little</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice Market Is Active</p>
<p>National Rice: Yesterday, a total of 5,000 bags of Heshang goods arrived, including 1,000 bags from Hupu. The market on the street was more active, but hoarding households remained on the sidelines due to a lack of warehouse space, so the market remained stable with little fluctuation. Prices for thick and thin Jeng, Du, Yangjian, and Bujien remained at their original levels. High-quality goods in Bien Yuan remained firm, while there were fewer inquiries about medium-quality goods, and the market was also sluggish.</p>
<p>Customer Xian: Yesterday, transactions turned active, and the market turned from sluggish to stable, with the situation becoming tighter. Only about 1,000 bags were publicly traded on the market, but individual retailers and hoarders directly negotiated about 3,000 bags. Transactions were mostly for large lots of goods priced at 10 yuan and 10.12 yuan, and fewer transactions were made for special goods and low-priced goods. After several days of sluggish declines, sellers were unwilling to sell at a loss, and buyers found it difficult to continue to depress prices, so they took the opportunity to buy.</p>
<p>Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Reappears at 28 Yuan</p>
<p>Due to Continuous Reports of Price Increases</p>
<p>On the Dalian Market</p>
<p>Soybean oil once entered the 28 yuan mark last Saturday. However, due to reports of price increases on the Dalian market on the previous two days, sentiment immediately rebounded. Yesterday, Dalian barrel oil exceeded the 28 yuan mark again, with prices of 28.05 yuan and 28.2 yuan, with a total of 150 barrels transacted, for delivery in late February, with 150 barrels also transacted at prices of 28.35 yuan and 28.5 yuan. Dalian Qilou oil also rose by 0.03 yuan, with 100 large barrels agreed at a price of 26.3 yuan and 150 small barrels at 26.5 yuan. Other Yanqi oil remained at its original price of 21.2 yuan, with 30 pieces transacted. Groundnut oil is arriving in a steady stream, causing anxiety, and the market price is uncertain. No transactions were seen on the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday there was...coming from...,</p>
<p>Northern Goods</p>
<p>Xinghua Longan and Hua Yuan Products Are Expensive</p>
<p>According to Xinghua Bang, there is definitely not much inventory of top-grade products such as authentic brand, authentic second, and bald barrels, so product prices have not loosened recently but have instead risen. According to news from the Xinghua Bang, prices are expected to increase by five to six yuan compared to before, and it is estimated that the spring market at the end of the year will definitely increase.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<p>The Financial Industry Has a Strong Desire to Hoard</p>
<p>The Market Is Full of Rising Momentum</p>
<p>Actual Sales of Eastern Piece Goods Are Quite Flat</p>
<p>National Cloth: Due to the European situation reaching its most serious stage, and the puppet government in North China announcing a second devaluation of legal tender, the financial industry has a strong desire to hoard. In addition, raw material prices are rising, and Japanese yarn is indeed strong, so the market is full of rising momentum. However, because the end of the lunar year is approaching, customer merchants' current needs are not strong, and market prices have temporarily turned quiet after rising sharply for several days, with little fluctuation. In the Southwest, the Sichuan Bang has a stronger purchasing appetite, with over 2,000 pieces of spring goods such as patterned and plain Fuchou, patterned Zigong, satin, hemp yarn, and patterned labels transacted. The Yunnan Bang purchased over 40 boxes of blue cloth, twill, bleached cloth, patterned cloth, and satin. The Wen Yong Bang purchased over 100 pieces of blue cloth, twill, and bleached cloth. The Guangdong Bang purchased four or fifty pieces of twill, blue cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. The Min Bang purchased several hundred pieces of local cloth, twill, and Shilin cloth from this factory. The Subei and Funing Bangs have greatly reduced their purchasing appetite, while the rural towns of Hai'an and Jialing have stepped up to purchase over a thousand pieces, mostly colored cloth. Wholesale shops on the street purchased over a hundred boxes of Qiantie, Biji, rough cloth, rough twill, and lower-grade dyed blank fine twill, and various factories are most busy delivering blank cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Because white cloth is being delivered by the end of the month, actual sales are flat. Fine cloth and fine twill are being resold by Tianjin Bang, and sentiment is loose. Spot market prices for various brands have uniformly declined, with fine cloth falling by 0.1 yuan to 0.15 yuan per piece and fine twill falling by 0.15 yuan to 0.2 yuan. Throughout the day, less than 500 pieces were absorbed by dyeing factories and industry members on this street. However, the market price still remains unchanged. The market price for 12-pound Caiqiu fine cloth is 12.25 yuan per piece, plus 0.0306 yuan in tax. There were no deals made yesterday, so most industry members, seeing the firm foundation of goods, still have the intention to hoard them when prices are low.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Exports: Today, 75 pieces were shipped to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, 10 pieces to Haikou, 9 pieces to Beihai, and 250 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<p>Demand for Felt, Woolen Fabric, and Down for Shoes Is Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, shoe shops in Xiaohuayuan, Zhejiang Road, Wumalu, and Pentang Street, as well as workshops, saw strong demand for materials for men's and women's colored shoes, such as five-colored felt, newly popular yellow camel down linings, floral checked shoe material, woolen fabric for overcoats, Yuan Zhi Gong woolen fabric, floral woolen fabric, ruler-six down, and camel down. Transactions for camel down linings and floral checked shoe material were particularly common. Top-grade material was priced at 15 yuan per yard, and second-grade material was priced at 12.25 yuan. Shops are currently selling cotton shoes made of this material for 7 yuan per pair for top-grade and 4.35 yuan per pair for ordinary grades. Business is said to be very good. Top-grade ruler-six down is 2.45 yuan, ordinary Western Yuan Zhi Gong is 9.67 yuan, and non-Western material is 5.9 yuan. Top-grade five-colored felt is 9.6 yuan, and second-grade is 7.89 yuan.</p>

<p>It's Unnecessary to Argue with the Useless</p>
<p>Buddha:</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported reliable news from Berlin that Hitler's speech this year will be longer than in previous years, even longer than any of his past speeches. The speech draft is about two hundred pages long, amounting to tens of thousands of words, which cannot be completed in two or three hours. Mr. Hitler's speech is too strenuous and unsuitable for the elderly. At the time the reporter wrote this article, Mr. Hitler's speech draft had not yet been read, so what he will be talking about is naturally unknown. But I can summarize this tens of thousands of words long article in two sentences: The first is to consolidate the Rome-Berlin Axis, and the second is to reclaim the colonies. In fact, not only is the speech draft too long and unnecessary, but also such a speech is meddlesome, because Mr. Hitler's intentions are already clear to everyone, so there is no need to use speeches for propaganda and make them known to every household. In fact, if Mr. Hitler is interested, he may as well write a "History of Aggression Techniques" for the world to read, which may not be a bad idea. Such a lengthy speech is really unnecessary.</p>
<p>It was also reported that Dr. Kawai, a professor of political economy at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, wrote a book that was considered by the authorities to disturb peace and order and was banned from publication. Recently, the new president, Dr. Hiraga, took office and then engaged in taking action against unstable elements, resulting in more than ten people being dismissed or resigning from the Department of Political Economy. What is Mr. Kawai's book about? Even the Japanese people are not fortunate enough to read it, and we can't even talk about having the opportunity to see it. However, Mr. Kawai's book is considered by the Japanese authorities to disrupt peace and order and is banned from publication, which shows that he is dissatisfied with the actions of the warlords. In fact, the anti-war sentiment among the Japanese people, with the exception of the warlords, is generally consistent, especially among the intellectual class, which is even more enthusiastic. However, under the pressure of the warlords' power, they are unable to resist and have to swallow their anger, remain silent, and seek temporary peace. But from time to time, there are generous and tragic heroes who express their discontent, which are then fabricated and purged by those who act as accomplices. The people are also very pitiful. However, this kind of suppression cannot last long. The so-called "preventing the people's mouths is like preventing rivers, and there will inevitably be a day of collapse and rupture. Moreover, the higher the pressure, the more severe the rupture; the stronger the prevention, the wider the collapse. It only shows that their efforts are fruitless. Dr. Kawai, please be patient and don't be discouraged. There will soon be a day to vent your anger."</p>
<p>At the Banquet</p>
<p>Ba Dun</p>
<p>In the towering building, I stood by the window. Looking down, pedestrians were like ants, and cars were like long snakes. The electric lights were flashing, like goddesses on the street, emitting alluring light.</p>
<p>It was a corner of the metropolis at night.</p>
<p>The heat was rippling in the room, like a spring breeze blowing across the water, causing ripples. People's faces were flushed, as if everyone had applied rouge. Melon seeds were crackling, being sent from the box into mouths, and then quickly thrown on the ground.</p>
<p>"Why isn't Mr. Tu here yet?" Old Li grabbed a handful of melon seeds, impatiently looked at his watch, and added, "It's past seven o'clock!"</p>
<p>Before anyone could join in the conversation, a voice jumped up: "A guest is here!" The door curtain was lifted, and it was our Mr. Tu who came in.</p>
<p>Everyone stood up, letting smiles roll all over their cheeks, and different words crawled out of different mouths:</p>
<p>"Haha, speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao arrives,"</p>
<p>"How unreasonable, people are celebrating your birthday, and you come so late!"</p>
<p>"A penalty drink! A penalty drink!"</p>

<h3>After the Close of the Fifth Plenary Session, No Changes in Central Political Organs; Cooperation with the Communist Party Seems to be Based on the Principle of Abandoning Party Membership; Mao Zedong and Others Will Be Appointed as Supreme National Defense Commissioners; The National Defense Commission Becomes the Highest Ruling Body in the Country</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Standing Committee, following the Fifth Plenary Session, convened on the 2nd. Apart from the announcement of the Deputy Minister of Propaganda, it is heard that there will be no changes in the political organs. The resolution on cooperation with the Communist Party holds that if they can abandon their party membership and join the Kuomintang, it would be deeply welcomed. Participation in political work in an individual capacity will also not be refused. The highest national wartime organ is about to be established to centralize authority and coordinate major plans, which will be implemented by the front and rear. A certain important person said that the future organization of China will be truly strict, and the new atmosphere will be enough to excite the whole country. In the future, everything in the country will be subject to military control, and no one will be allowed to evade military service, which is tantamount to making every citizen a soldier. The rational arrangement of all military, political, party affairs, economic, and financial matters is sufficient to support a protracted war of resistance. In the front, in addition to the deployment of positions to cope with stubborn enemies, there are also considerable preparations for the future recovery of the country and the construction of a modern nation. (Special dispatch, 9 PM on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A United Press reporter inquired with a senior official of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee about the nature and role of the Supreme National Defense Commission established by the recent resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session. He stated that according to the original resolution, the nature and role of this organization are unprecedented. This group is organizationally a liaison mechanism between the Kuomintang and the National Government, similar to the Central Political Committee, but with greater power and a broader role. The Central Political Committee can only decide on administrative matters; the Supreme National Defense Commission is a military and political decision-making and command body, responsible only to the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. All political, military, and party affairs related to the war of resistance aim to coordinate various activities to achieve ultimate victory and consolidate unity, so that all national strength and resources are used for the war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, this organization is not established under the National Government, but under the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. Its members include leaders from the national political, military, party, and cultural circles, and are therefore not limited to Kuomintang members. Members and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, the China Youth Party, and the Chinese National Socialist Party will all be invited to participate. It is heard that Communist Party leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De have been invited to join the commission. All military, political, and party organs must abide by the decisions made by the commission. China must now strive to absorb the spirit of democracy, and the purpose of this commission is to implement this point. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Kuomintang sources speaking to a United Press reporter, the Supreme National Defense Commission will begin work on February 1st. The National Government's political and administrative organs, the National Military Council (military administrative organ), and the Kuomintang Central Headquarters (organ for executing party affairs) are all subject to the control of the Supreme National Defense Commission. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Political figures here today stated that yesterday's declaration from the Fifth Plenary Session clarified that the Kuomintang does not want members joining from two parties to exist. In other words, it rejects the Communist Party's hope of allowing Communist Party members to join the Kuomintang. However, this cannot be immediately interpreted as friction between the two parties, as the Communist Party has never formally made such a proposal. The Communist Party has proposed allowing Communist Party members to join the Three People's Principles Youth League, but this is different from requesting to join the Kuomintang. According to the current plan, the Three People's Principles Youth League is no longer a party organ but a state organ, allowing members of all parties to participate. Furthermore, the Ta Kung Pao commented that the declaration of the conference indicated that all parties in China will remain in their original state and will not change their organizations, but all must strive together under the guidance of the Three People's Principles to seek liberation for the nation. According to reliable sources, Communist Party members will not participate in the government in the near future, but several Communist Party leaders, such as Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, etc., will be appointed as members of the Supreme National Defense Commission. The Supreme National Defense Commission is an expanded organization of the former National Defense Council. The former National Defense Council was merely an advisory body, whereas the current new Supreme National Defense Commission is the highest command organ for political and military activities during the war. The Military Council and the Ministry of Military Administration are both administrative organs under the control of the new Supreme National Defense Commission. (United Press dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>British Royal Aircraft Suddenly Attacked by Japanese Warship; Incident Occurs Near Weizhou Island; Fortunately, No Hits; Continues to Fly to Bangkok</h3>
