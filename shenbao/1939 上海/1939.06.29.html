<p>（倫敦）外相哈立法克斯勳爵、今日在上院宣稱、渠對於天津毫無防禦之英僑被褫衣搜査事、已用極强硬之措詞、向日大使重光葵提出抗議、並謂不日卽將在東京開始談判、以期解決天津之局勢云、英帝國商會前任會長愛理邦克勳爵謂外相所用之外交詞令中、不能過於有力以便日政府威覺英國及其帝國對於其國家所遭日方不堪忍受之侮辱、日方對貿易利益所施之不正當高壓行動、及日政府無遏止之意向、已激起公憤、工黨斯尼爾勳爵繼起發言、謂在柬京舉行之談判中、對於最近日本轟炸中國時、致加拿大敎士夫婦被炸殞命之事件、是吾將予以調査、外相答稱、此事當然不能予以忽視云、外相又向愛理邦克勳爵聲稱、未來束京之談話、將關於各地方事件、渠已充分感到天津之糾紛、已激起英國人民天然及正當的情緒之力量云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>英報懷疑東京談判</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國各報對於日本已贊同與英國在東京開始津案談判一舉、均以審愼之詞表示歡迎、但言中含有强度疑慮之意味、新聞紀事報載名記者巴特萊特氏所著一文、謂渠嘗自遠方各國如美國印度紐絲綸方面聞有權威的警告、如「綏靖」政策再見於遠東、足以招致有害之影饗、但今未敢遽保政府之未策畫綏靖也、日方對施於天津英僑之暴行、迄未公開道歉、致令遠東各國不得不具錯誤之印象、以為英國已委身服從日本在華之霸權矣、孟却斯德指導報謂日方決試騐在其他各點如華北貨幣之類、能推走英國至於幾遠、現望英政府勿再返至綏靖政策、此徒能獲暫時之寬慰、而非永久計也、每日民聲報謂今日之問題、為日方將表示何種合作、日方如提出破壞租界自治之要求、促令將租界居民交與事實上受日本軍閥控制之傀儡、則接受要求、實不成問題、至在經濟方面、如要求承認聯準紙幣、及交出國民政府現存於英租界之現款五千萬元、亦悉為不成間題者、每日電聞謂日軍總司令本間中將委婉述及天津封鎖時所舉之「交通限制、」仍為日本政策之主要爭點、此項交通限制之實施、乃以報復西方列强者、今似已臻將限制英帝國日人經濟交通可能性在任何談判中提置前列之時矣、泰晤士報載費里浦氏投函、切言香港·馬來。北婆羅島及遠東其他各地處英國治下之東方社團、為數甚夥、英政府繼續不能保護天津英租界之人民、而令受日人之侮辱、此其影響及於上述社團者為害實不堪設想云、今日上議院開會時、議員愛理邦克勳爵曾發問話、切言天津局勢遲遲不能解圍之危險、並請政府注意日人若再以不堪忍受之侮辱施諸英僑、則將發生何種後患、（廿八日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京各報對英恫嚇</p>
<p>（東京）今日此間各報均注意於英國對天津事件之態度、中外商業新聞載稱、天津之英租界不啻為英國親蔣政策之「縮影」、英國之亟欲保障其在華之利益、固盡人皆知、惟英國對於華北之「現實」、如不允加以相當之注意、則或將有喪失其全部華北利益之可能云、國民新聞則謂、英方僅交出刺殺程錫庚之兇手、將不能解决天津之糾紛、或對於調整英日兩國日趨仇視之局勢上、有何裨益、該報又稱、環境之力量、已迫使英國修改其親蔣反日之政策云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本封鎖中國海全部</h3>
<p>日本近來對華的戰事，在晋西鄂北連遭重大的失敗以後，她的泥足正是愈陷愈深，陷入亳無辦法的時際，却突然企圖展開她的戰鬭的局面：於華北公然對英國取挑戰的態度，用暴力封鎖英租界，對英國軍民肆行侮辱，幾於無所不用其極；於東北則對蘇聯的戰事，也已公然在啟釁之中，觀於雙方戰報所稱擊落對方飛機的數目，其嚴重的情形，實亦不下於張鼓峯事件的重燃；於中國則日本更加緊沿海岸的封鎖，並在各海口各海島到處派兵登陸。前幾天剛剛奪取汕頭，最近又連佔舟山羣島等處，日昨更又佔領溫州沿海的虎頭島和玉環島的坎門港，以及閩江口外的川石島。這樣看來，中國閩浙粵沿海所殘存的幾處海口，差不多是全部被日軍封鎖了佔領了。</p>
<p>在日本海陸軍人的眼中看來，這種接二連三的示威行動，和勝利的佔領（？），眞是怎樣足以値得渲染誇耀的戰績！國際上不明內情的人，也許一時為所震驚，以為日本畢竟還有能為，還有所謂威望存在；而在陷於新聞統制綱中的日本國民，也許一時視聽為之移轉，因而更加興奮；便是想同日本妥協的份子，也許因此更有趨於軟化屈服的可能。但是這究竟何損於中國的抗戰力量呢？</p>
<p>要說封鎖中國軍火的來源麽？這些海口因為內陸交通困難，就從來未嘗嘗嘗作為軍火輸入的路綫；現時封鎖，自然也無礙於中國的軍需來源。要說摧毀中國的軍事主力麽？中日決戰的塲所，早已不在沿海而在內地；並且這些港口的對內交通旣屬困難，日軍便佔據這些地方，也就無異於從前之佔據廈門瓊州等處，徒耗兵力，毫無戰果，結果也只徒然供給中國「消耗戰」的材料罷了。至於說到妨礙中國商業交通以及一般沿海的經濟，却也未始沒有一部份理由；但是我們要曉得，目前的中國經濟活動，實已儘量向抗戰根據地的西南發展。中國正謀隔離淪陷地域被控制的經濟勢力的繁興，以免有資盜糧之嫌；縱使斷絕沿海交通，這也是毒蛇螫手壯士斷腕精神的表現，又何所用其顧慮！並且海口封鎖，像現在有些託名的國貨，和高價的洋貨，至少也可以限制他們走漏流通的便利，於抗戰經濟，也並不是沒有裨益。</p>
<p>所以就中國方面說，日軍之封鎖佔領沿海海口，實際的損害實在很小；問題的中心，還是日本破壞歐美各國在華的權益，因此一事而更趨顯著，更陷於不可收拾。我們曉得，歐美各國在華的權益，現在殘存的只有所謂航業；然而長江不許通航，珠江靑島等處受種種限制，其所受損害的程度也就可觀；現在沿海幾個重要港口如汕頭，福州，甯波，溫州等處，又被日軍澈底封鎖，則以後歐美各國還有什麽沿海航業可說？所以日本的封鎖中國沿海，實無異於澈底驅逐歐美在華的商業，這自是顯而易見的事。</p>
<p>現在英美各國還要同日本談法理，她已經給你一個事實的不理睬了。可憐美國孤立派的人士，還以為大火沒有燒着自已的眉毛；而允其可憐的張伯倫先生，在天津的反英運動中，旣已自認遭受莫大的「難堪侮辱」，而仍不放棄就地妥協的希望；現在日本又已急轉直下的封鎖中國沿海全部的英商航業了，在英國為着維持在華權益的立塲上，不知又將怎樣以謀獲得妥協呢？英國海軍方面，好像還是拘拘於法理方面，以為中日戰事係不宣而戰，第三國船舶應有出入佔領港的自由，希望因此能得着日方的許可。不料日方竟以不宣而戰便是普通戰爭的常事，竟公然承認為「戰時封鎖」了。我們曉得，戰時封鎖，完全為宣戰後的一種戰爭行為。日本對華不宣而戰，怎麽可以假藉封鎖的名義，而妨礙其他國家的船舶出入呢？這豈不是公然違反國際法上海洋自由及中立商務的原則？這豈不是鑒於英國無所能為而有意的開頑笑？</p>
<p>記得日本最初宣吿封鎖中國海岸時，也嘗揚言尊重第三國的通商；嗣後一再妨害英美各國通商利益，英美都是默爾而息，實際上並無何等舉動。現在日本是變本加厲作全海岸的澈底卦鎖了，這種咄咄逼人的氣焰，只是對英美各國威脅，英美各國若果眞的願意放棄在華的商業權益，並盡撒其遠東國防，也就罷了；吾則此刻實在已不需要法理的辯駁而只需要行動的表現了。這决的事情，或者是最後的一塊試金石吧！</p>
<h3>日禁外船滯留福温　英美均置之不理　任何損害須由日負担英艦載運客郵入汕港</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院某員今日聲稱、美國不理會日方所發外船與外人離去福州與溫州之警吿、日本須負美船所遭任何損害之責任云、（二十七日路透社電）</p>

<p>外交政策不致變更</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參議院昨口通過湯生德修正案、决定停止向國外購買白銀事、頃由半官方面加以評論、謂此非美國變更現行外交政策之謂、湯德生修正案之被可决、由於內政之觀點者為多、故尙不足為慮、反之、政府當局感覺焦念者、厥為參議院拒不以其他兩種權限　予羅斯福總統、一即變更美元金成色之權、一為規定內團銀價之權、此在政府、務當竭力予以保持、至於向國外購買白銀之權、猶其决要耳、在美國停購國外白銀之後、最受直接影饗者、厥為墨西哥、國會各議員因墨　政府沒收美商各煤油礦、已歷多時、對於美國各關係公司所提要求延米予以滿足、故皆表示不滿、為墨國辯護者絕無其人、抑墨國政府聞湯生德案通過之後、立即要求美國對於賡續向國外購銀一層、提供保證以與該國在煤油礦沒收案中所持延岩熊度相較、大有前倨後恭之觀云（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>對中國無多大影響</p>
<p>華盛頓　據財政部專家宣稱、彼輩本無利用總統特權、而操縱國內經濟之意、其唯一企圖、即爲保議美國貨幣、以免遭受外幣貶値之影響、並調購銀法之取消法案、茍若再經衆議院通過，則中國亦未必遭受影響、蓋中國所能出售之白銀、其為數實已無多也、（二十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>各參議員意見一致</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國國會方面現有一種感想、以為羅斯福總統如欲保持平準金、則勢須接受其美元貶値權之終止、與更高之銀價、現有參議員四十八人團結一致、如衆院不贊同參院昨日之修正文而將原案退還參院則彼等將竭力阻止整個貨幣案之通過、查參院昨核准政府二十萬萬元平準金並通過下述修正文、（一）許財政部於收買本國白銀時有百分四十之鑄幣稅而將本國新出礦之銀價增至每盎斯七角七分四、（二）停止財政部收買國外白銀之權、（三）總統所有减低幣値之權於六月三十日終止、二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>財部減低白銀價格</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美財部今日已將在紐的收買國外白銀之價格、由每盎斯四角三分减至四角、官塲尙未宣布其低外銀收買價之理由、惟說者謂倫敦與紐的市價相差漸遠、如買價不變、則向美財部交貨者、數量必鉅、故美財部不得不有此舉、據韓狄哈曼公司紐的大條銀之正式價格、已由每盎斯四角二分七五减至三角九分七五、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國現向國外購買白銀、每盎斯定傻為美幣四角三分、財政部頃决定减為每盎斯四角、自木日午刻（當地時間）起實行、有效期間、為二十四小時、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間一般銀商因美國財部大削外國銀價、大為悲觀、預料銀價將繼續下跌、（廿八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>政府仍可收購黃金</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統在幣制上所享有之權力將於本月三十日屆滿、政府會經提出法律案、要求延長時效兩年、參議院昨日予以修正通過、「取消總統變更美金成色之權、」此事頃由財政部各專家加以評論云、衆議院縱使繼參議院之後取消總統此項特權、總統仍可於必要時、設法變更美元價値、緣總統現仍保有命令財政部收購黃金之權、其期與方式、不受何項限制、只須繼續收購黃金、則金價即可提高、而美元之價値、亦即因而低落、前當一九三三年閒、羅斯福總統曾將金價自每盎斯二十美元六角七分、提高至三十五元、即其前例云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>墨西哥停外匯交易</p>
<p>墨西哥　此間墨西哥銀行等昨日暫停外匯交易、聞此舉乃係美國參議院通過白銀購買法取消法案之結果、又此間美元之暗盤市價、計為五·二五比索（墨西哥銀圓）、較以往减少〇·七五比索、據墨西哥銀行通吿稱、在美國續購外國白銀以前、外匯供給當暫行停止、（二十八日美聯電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯的西窗</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>「Wehrmacht」德國陸軍參謀部的機關報，近載一文，讀了可知德國對於蘇聯在北氷洋海岸一帶所佈置的軍備，極懷憂懼，因為怕蘇聯一且攘奪斯干的那維亞半島上各國的礦產，那便大不利於德國。讀了這文，並可知道德國近來竭力拉攏斯干的那維亞半島上四國與他締結互不侵犯協定，及芬蘭竭力主張在埃倫島設防，蘇聯却竭力反對的原因。現在挪威丹麥瑞典三國都和德國簽定互不侵犯條的，只有芬蘭曾加拒絕。至於埃倫島設防問題，芬蘭懾於蘇聯的威力，聽說將作罷了</p>
<p>荒凉的茂曼Murman海岸陸地伏在北歐的邊際，在那裏並無森林，岩石之上只長些苔蘇，即有林木，也不過幾株矮樹，搖搖欲墜。北氷洋吹來的狂風，掃入柯拉半島，勢不可禦，溫熱的灣流，却以該地為駐足之所，因此海濱一帶終年得免結氷。再過一代，亦許還沒有歐人願意棲身該地，假使沒有科學的長足進步，那末，這些北氷洋的天涯地角，仍將和數世紀來相同，毫無人烟哩。</p>
<p>北氷洋的蘇聯攻擊根據地，業已成為現實了。包括兩大陸的一個國家，在這極遠的西北角建立如此强固的根據地，那是俄國積極外交政策理所常然的結果，何况蘇聯是沙皇帝國的承繼者，在政治上也有偉大的局而，自然不肯放鬆一步</p>
<p>大彼得首先調整大俄國竄劣未受訓練的軍隊，以為他的顯明外交政策的後盾。他抱着兩層目的，那便是（一）「在西陲開一窗戶」，進窺歐洲，（二）成一海權國，他在後一點，從未達到目的，以後俄國的元有也是如此。</p>
<p>直至最近，俄國還沒有通入大海的孔道，有人說：「俄國通海的門戶，只有這上帝放棄的茂曼海岸一帶「並無別處」。這話似覺無稽，但打開俄國地圖一看，却的確如此。俄國雖有波羅的海和黑海為邊界，但遇到戰爭，兩地都能被比她小的國家堵塞，再加俄國在波羅的海的一角，一年之中有好幾個月被氷封鎖。海參崴呢，冬季結氷，面對日本，也不能算得「太平洋上有用的窗戶」，至於餘剩的北氷洋沿岸之地，那是遠距國家工業中心點，而且一年中只有兩個多月可以通行，在通行之際，這是很危險的。</p>
<p>所以俄國只有極北茂曼沿海的二百哩的土地是長年不凍的，但重載的船舶，在那裏也只能在不足約五十哩之地覓得停泊所。</p>
<p>蘇聯主耍目的之一，是博得世界强國的地位。若果如此，那末第一步須先成一海權國。沙皇衣缽的唯一承繼人史丹林，曾下命令，不惜任何代價，到達大西洋，因此便依偉大的規模，利用人力物力和金錢，經營此舉。茂曼鐵路早告功成，聽說現已敷設雙軌，或者已由水電廠將該路電氣化。趨向芬蘭邊界的枝路，也將完工，或在興建中。汽車公路網也在不斷地擴張着，允其注意迦勒里亞Karelia境內的工作</p>
<p>軍事動員須有良好的交通綫。據北方傳來消息，現在的交通，已足供調動數師軍隊之用。波羅的海至白海的另一交通血脈，已使列寗格勒直接通至北氷洋各口岸，那已將環繞斯干的那維亞半島的海程减短一半，不幸那條運河，一年中也有半年被氷封阻。</p>
<p>柯拉Kola半島有豐富至重要的原料，如製燐的憐灰石，也是一種，此外還產鐵鎳等金屬，甚至南面加勒里亞，也發見重要的寶藏。</p>
<p>近年來戶口增加很速，已超過以前多倍。原在俄屬加勒里亞，佔多數操芬蘭語的居民，逐步遷出，沿芬蘭邊界之地一大片，全無平民居住，而由勁旅駐防。這些巨數的特別邊防隊，都直接受秘密軍務處節制，在這北氷洋和附屬北氷洋的土地中，人烟稀少，駐紮飽受訓練的空軍，是極關重要的。因此已造成航空港多處，共有多少，和容量如何，却無人知道，據傳其中有兩處，每處各有能容飛機四十架的機庫。</p>
<p>茂曼鐵路長的一千哩，以茂曼斯克城為終點。這原是一個無關重要之地，但在已往十年中，居民已增至十萬人以上，並建有現代式的船塢船港的便利。北氷洋的鑿氷船和漁船，都聚泊在那裏，對外貿易的收入，逐年增加。距茂曼斯克北二十哩有波爾雅諾伊鎭，（前為亞力山特羅夫斯克）鎭上的砲臺不斷地增固軍備，那長射程的大砲，能有效地阻止敵艦駛入長五十哩的海灣。目下洦在那裹的，不過較小的軍艦，如魚雷巡洋艦·水雷艇·潛艇·輔助艦·大的還有航空母艦之類。去年據某方面傳出消息，港內有魚雷艇二十五艘，潛艇十五艘，都是最近造成的，潛艇的設備，可以充埋雷艦之用。今日甚至瑞典國，也感覺到北海蘇聯海軍的威脅，最重要的是據傳不日行將完工的新巡洋艦數艘，要撥入北氷洋服役。（未完）</p>

<h3>月經剛凈時的女性　易對丈夫熱烈挑情</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>夫婦間若無生殖行為發動時，當然不能和好相處，所以生殖行為實為婚後必不可少的重要要素，在平時這種生殖行為的發動，丈夫常居於主動地位，惟獨於妻子月經剛凈時期，則一反常例，此時妻子始感生殖的興趣，必種種設法，以引誘丈夫，使之性慾衝動，得滿足其性感，蓋女性有性潮，周而復始，循環不絕，而潮之量高時，亦即月經來潮之終結時，故研究生物學者，竟以女性之月經，比諸獸之交尾期，且以月經期卽為交尾期之變相者，此雖米可盡信，要亦不無相當之見地，故女性中不乏在平時極幽嫺貞靜，不苟言笑，而一至月經來潮期中，頓然一變其面目者，是雖與神經有種種之關係，不僅性慾一端，而生殖慾之衝動，要亦不失為一種有力之主因，不容疑也。</p>
<p>月經為每個女子必有的生理現象，然月經剛時的女性，旣有感性慾飢荒者，則做丈夫亦應明察秋毫，勿使他感覺失望，何况月經祇一月一次，一月中一二次之性行為，不能認為縱慾，不過問題就在丈夫的精力，是吾是能勝任，假若精力渙散，素有早洩，則後患堪虞，夫婦不睦的原因，或即於此，然欲彌補此種缺陷，並非難事，以余廿年來治療腎虧的經騐而論，購服德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」。最為對症，服後元陽充沛，早洩陰萎一掃而空，其女用有調經種子之功。今特舉載患者治騐一例，以證明本劑之功效。</p>
<p>患者羅懊民，年二十九歲，（自訴）。因早年縱慾過度婚後患早洩陰萎，每遇房事，最長時間不過五十秒鍾，有時竟患陰莖不舉，故雖結婚已有六年，而無子嗣。（治愈經過）。囑其注意攝生，投以大量之「補體康」，並每日電療，經十二星期後，其性機能活潑健全，精力充沛，健康恢復矣。</p>
<p>現代醫學</p>
<h3>娼妓與淋病問題</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師述</p>
<p>吾國古諺有云，「家花沒有野花香」，故即有家空的男子，亦每喜涉足平康。沾花惹草，結果每染淋病，而妻子無辜受累，白帶隱病，層出不窮。又如靑年在春機發動期，意志不堅，輙受劣友引誘，失身娼寮。又或困於經濟，無力結婚，乃亦折柳攀花，為精神與肉體上暫時之慰藉。</p>
<p>據此，可知淋病之猖在，原為由於一般性生活之苦悶，他方叉因淋病本身難於醫治，遷延滋蔓，以致輾轉傳染。變化多端。若用一般透膜殺菌療法，或化學療法，均將不能完成其根治淋病之責任，因此等療法，僅能在表面局部，稍呈殺菌之作用，但其副作用甚大，服後腸胃受到刺戟，嘔吐頻增，頭暈面目發靑等弊。故世界各國，對於此等療法，不復置信，而以德國彼德博士發明之「克淋儂」功效最著。無不熱烈提倡應用，結果成績大佳。因「克淋儂」係根據淋病非特異性療法，採用蛋白體黃色素等混合製成，歷經長時期之試騐，知服此藥後，能旺盛細胞抗淋噬菌作用，則無論男女淋病，均可有保障獲得根治。如急慢性中之攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，尿道炎，膀胱炎，等症，服「克淋儂」均有卓效，在三五星期中完全可以根治，一方並可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書洗滌尿道，至於女子淋毒白帶，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，同時內服「克淋儂」，亦能收迅捷之功。徹底根治。</p>
<h3>易染肺病之人</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病之起源，由於結核菌之傳染而起，通常多發於二十歲之前後，而身體虛弱，胸廓狹窄，發育不全之人最易傳染。故有上述現象之人，不得不嚴加預防，而肺病之前驅，大都為不斷地咳嗽，故對久咳不治的咳嗽患者，亦應嚴防肺病的來臨，咳嗽旣為肺病之前驅，而患者苦無有效之藥劑，余以醫師地位而敢為介紹者，惟「補肺拿爾」一藥，確具鎭咳化痰治肺之功，故不論執拗之咳嗽，一服「補肺拿爾」卽能迅速見效，治肺，本劑允具特別之功效，不論一，二，三期之肺病，一服本劑，實有着手回春之妙，患者幸不自誤。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　因遺精而引起神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者董企民，江蘇泰縣人，年二十五歲。（自訴）。十五六歲時犯過手淫，即知害戒除，但難免時常想像淫猥之狀，結果仍常排出精液，積久，於排便或勃起時有少量精液流出夜遺更不待言，記憶力大减，常覺心悸，稍事操作即感疲勞，精神憂鬰，極度悲觀。（治愈經過）。先投以「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精。並服大量之『補體康』以補虛弱，兩個月後，病已治好，精神肉體均極健康。</p>
<h3>一個患發育不全的得救</h3>
<p>患者烏建平，江西南昌人，年二十歲。（自訴）。自十歲左右，即以撫弄性器為樂，後遂成為手淫，十五六歲理當發育，因此摧殘而使發育障碍，故現雖年已雙十，而性器允如小兒，遺精則每星期有二决之多。（治愈經過）。令服「耐而斯遺精片」及「補體康」。並每日電療，經三月而愈。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>妻兒怨恨的白濁</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>俗話説得好，「一人做事一人當」這是以一般人做壞了事，一人承受的話。可是生了病，尤其生了淋病，那你如果不小心，這塲禍，你的妻子，就不得不來同你一齊來担了。所以有了妻子的話，最好先將淋病治好之後，再實行同居，以免輾轉傳染；永遠弄得拖泥帶水，不能完全根治，而且妻悲子怨，把和樂的家庭，弄得烏煙瘴氣，豈非郋所之咎。在淋病患者最易疎忽之事，無過於慢性副尿道炎一症，因此症如一過急性後，對於痛苦一層，既已消逝，於是不復顧慮，縱情任意，一如未病之時，而可怖之淋毒，遂傳染於妻子，有時因爲病家自以爲病已全愈，今見妻子下體發生淋毒白帶，反有疑她不貞之事。豈非寃沈海底。故賢明的丈夫，要保持夫妻的愛情，必先將本身的淋病迅速治愈，否則不僅淋毒傳染妻子，且因分娩時之嬰孩，經過産道如白帶沾入眼內，而有失明之危險。余在臨床上有不少病家，訴説此苦。惟如能服用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，一方用德國静電療法，因爲「克淋儂」具有超越之殺菌力，其殺菌力遠過市上一般化學療法之上，又得静電療法以發揮此藥之殺菌力，更能迅速獲愈。女子除可服用「克淋儂」外，更可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，亦可短期收功　診時：上午十時至下午六時自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>金融　白銀猛跌　黃金漲風驟起　殷富儲藏心思復濃市塲頓感求過於供</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、連日傾向下游已綿互五天之久、共暴落二百元、迫昨驟起反動、漲風亦頗劇烈、一度曾高達二千五百七十五元、實因國外白銀均告猛跌、並天津情形稍轉緩和、外匯遂起劇緊、因之各方人心驟轉堅昂本市殷實收購藏儲心思復濃、紛紛委託綾兌業爭先吸購、雖證券帮與某銀號及現金號等陸續吐售、無如仍感求過於供、致市價頻頻上提、惟近晚收前因浮多獲利了結、而稍回挫、但市勢仍極堅穩、結果以二千五百六十八元收盤、較上日回漲六十八元、全天交易尙旺、達七百餘兩、銀樓飾金亦接連掛高八元、海關金與中英純金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤跳六十八元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開錢兌業買氣頗濃、且外匯突然步緊致賣者供意殊淡、九時四十分開市即抬高十元、錢兌業進現金號二十兩、價十千五百十元、繼之另一錢兌業亦進證券帮三十兩、價十二元、時北帮又委託證券帮及錢兌業相繼供塞、致一度略回、錢兌業代北帮賣於銀樓帮五十兩、價十元、繼而證券帮亦塞予金號十兩、價零八元、後錢兌業代北帮塞予銀樓帮五十兩、價〇九元、不久證劵帮又賣予金號十兩，價〇八元、此後北帮止塞、頓轉向上、價一躍六元、錢兌業進銀樓帮十兩、價十四元、繼之銀樓帮進現金號三十兩、價則相同、時外匯繼續報緊、且某錢兌業進意蓬勃、加以售者甚缺、瞬息又抬高六元、某錢兌業進金號五十兩、價廿元、俄又飛升五元、某錢兌業又進銀樓帮二十兩、價二十五元、不久再漲起五兀、某錢兌業再進銀樓帮三十兩、價三十元、時售者愈缺、價再飛騰十元、錢兌業進某銀號一十兩、價四十元、後某錢兌業復來吸購、但幸同業供意尙佳、故為狀轉平、某錢兌業進同業百兩、價三十五元及三十七元、其時外匯再度報緊、加之另一錢兌業亦止塞轉進、故漲風重起、一剎那飛躍九元、錢兌業進某銀號五十兩、價四十六元、繼又上騰八元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價五十四元、午刻聞黑市美匯已破入十三元大關、致售者絕跡、價又飛漲十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、六十四元為午收價、午後因外匯收後繼續趨軟、故市勢頗堅、開市即高五元、金號互做五十兩、價七十元、時錢兌業買意股切、未幾即升五元、錢兌業互做二十兩、價七十五元、繼之金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、價七十四元、此後散戶與現金號趁高吐售、故遂反動回下、現金號塞予錢兌業二十兩、價六十七元、後錢兌業互做五十兩、價又回高至七十一元、二時五十分錢兌業互做五十兩、便二千五百六十八元、結果較上日回漲六十八元、全天六十七元差度、現金號之本脾金較烚赤高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢均鮮少做開、</p>
<p>首飾金連漲八元　銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初未更動、迨至十時二十分因烚赤潛勢堅挺、故均掛大三元、十一時三刻又各掛大三元、午後二時半再掛高二元、此後無變化、計大同行改懸二百六十一元、新同行為二百五十九元、收進二百五十三元、</p>

<h3>封鎖津租界的經濟意味</h3>
<p>顧孝慧</p>
<p>本月十四日，日本以未得要求引渡天津英租界行刺天津「聯合準備銀行行長」程錫庚的嫌疑犯的藉口，而對天津英法兩租判實施封鎖，到今天已十四天了。日方公然說「刀已出鞘，」談判之門已閉，非得英國完全對日表示屈膝，不放棄封鎖政策。英國方面，盤馬膏弓，俄而熊度强硬，欲施報復；但最近消息，英日又在東京談判，則英國對於日本，亦可謂為能忍辱負重矣。</p>
<p>（一）排斥三國在華北市塲貿易</p>
<p>日本何以欲封鎖天津英租界，表萬上是政治理由，實際上是經濟陰謀，為了英美法三國在中國的貿易，除上海代表華中為吐納口，佔全國最大部份以外；在華北方面，則以天津為總紐，三國在天津的貿易單以美國一國而言，平時每年總額的達二萬萬元以上。本來各國在中國的貿易，美英與日本，相互競爭，至為激烈，自日木侵佔華北後，對華北各關口，實施統制，如靑島木亦為重要港口，被日本加以封鎖，在天津因有着租界的關係，英美法三國商業，得以藉此活動，此為日方所嫉忌。如英美在天津市塲，著名的商業有英美烟草公司，亞細亞等火油公司，及各進出口行商，收購原料品如羊毛，棉花、皮毛、豬鬃、蛋品等等，更與日方形成衝突，而此種活動，都在租界以內，日方無權力加以干涉，故日方因嫉忌而老羞成怒，斷然出以封鎖，此為封鎖原因的重要之一點。</p>
<p>（二）威脅租界內中外銀行的活動</p>
<p>在天津租界內的中外銀行的活動，此亦為日方所不悅的一點，現下在天津租界內的中外銀行，計有：</p>
<p>華商</p>
<p>發行額（單位千元）</p>
<p>中央銀行　三二，三四三元</p>
<p>中國銀行　一一五，一六一元</p>
<p>交通銀行　五五，八四〇元</p>
<p>英商　實收資本</p>
<p>匯豐銀行　五〇，〇〇〇千港元</p>
<p>麥加利銀行　三，〇〇〇千鎊</p>
<p>美商</p>
<p>花旗銀行　一二七，五〇〇千美元</p>
<p>運通銀行　六，〇〇〇千美元</p>
<p>大通銀行　五，〇〇〇千美元</p>
<p>商業放款銀行　四八千美元</p>
<p>法商</p>
<p>東方匯理銀行　一二〇，〇〇〇千法郞</p>
<p>因有此等中外金融機構，外商得仍能在天津經營商業，日方為欲排斥英美在華北市塲的貿易，故威脅此等銀行活動，同時因租界內外商銀行，不受匯兌限制的束縛，而日木銀行必須維持一先令兩便士的訂定匯價，故外商得以利用低匯率予出口商以格外便利，以至華北出口應得外匯，都流入外商銀行，而日本銀行絕無第三國外匯交易，且此等銀行均以法幣為通貨，故在日本對此等銀行的存在，是認為破壞它的「新幣制政策，」不能實施它的統制制度，這也是一個原因。（未完）</p>
<h3>外匯反動突緊　津帮與沙遜奮力爭購洋行因月杪結款亦繁</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛脾、悉無變化、英美滙暗市、初時因日行續來拋塞、故市勢尙穩、九時半後、因聞天津英日關係、稍呈弛懈、加以外行有利（代津帮）並西商沙遜等奮力爭扒、兼洋行因月杪在即、故結款轉繁、且外商銀行賣意頗淡、大非貴價不願脫手、故在三重猛烈扒風下、反動劇緊、接連步鬆五天之長度、幾於半日中回平、雖其時有外電香港及印度銀公司吐出、奈本市各銀行所還出者、有進價而無賣價、致成求過於供之勢、聞收後英金會緊至六辦士五九三七五、美滙亦軟至十二元八一二五、兼之英美互滙、復轉上漲、因之英較美允覺緊縮、中途毫無廻顧、牛日間交易頗旺、至港滙亦隨之猛緊一元、軟至四十五元一二五光景、</p>
<p>美匯又進十三元關</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均猛降六八九五、紐約銀價亦暴縮三分、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美大一釐三、對滬長〇六二五、對法升一分、美對英漲〇六二五、對滬未更、對法大〇六二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金六辦士八七五、美滙十三元四〇六二五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後日行雖續來吐售、無如外行吃胃頗佳、致鮮變化、計日行塞予滙豐現貨英金六辦士八七五、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉免微、（蓋大條十九辦士一八七五起徵）、此後雖日行續有賣意、無如西商沙遜猛烈扒結、加之各洋行界亦起競吸、且外商各行供源頗滯、致情况逐步緊軟、計沙遜吸進日行現貨英金六辦士八一二五、繼而洋行結進滙豐華比現貨英金為六辦士七五、兼又購結大通某行現貨美滙為十三元二五、時雖外電香港與印度銀公司供塞維持、但因沙遜仍猛扒不休、加以津帮納量甚旺、致仍感杯水車薪、致為狀繼續猛緊、計沙遜與有利（代津帮）競相購結港電與印度銀公司及外行等現貨英金由六辦士七五、緊至六二五、並進現貨、美滙由十三元二五軟至十三元、時已午刻、港滙亦隨之步緊至四十五元一二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金六辦士六二五、美滙已破人十三元內、為十二元九六八七五、已逼近滙豐之維持價、結果較之前收、英緊二五、美軟四三七五、港滙亦軋貴一元、聞現貨英美滙收後、買方扒意仍濃、致市勢續趨緊軟、英金已緊至六辦士五九三七五、美滙亦軟至十二元八一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港申匯升四元五</p>
<p>香港二十八日电、今日滙市晨閒、脚地堅穩、英滙現期貨、比昨收均長〇三一二五、美滙現期均長〇六二五、日滙現貨長二角五分、申滙平、十時四十五分、申滙升一元五角為二百十七元、餘無變動、十一時三十分、各滙均站原盤、午收英滙現貨回縮〇三一二五、遠期平、美滙現貨均縮〇六二五、申滙續升三元、日滙回縮一二五、下午週三無市、</p>
<h3>外幣亦見　急遽上騰</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美匯兌續升零六二五、本埠外櫃、初趨鬆動、市價與昨晚相彷彿、而銀行半年結賬將屆、洋行結款甚殷、津電吸收猛烈、市况轉緊、西商扒納頻仍、外銀行供給不暢、市况步步軟弱、似於津案有關、結果英匯為六便士六二五、較上日緊二五、美匯為十二元九六八七五、收後做八一二五、亦緊四三七五、週三下午無市、烚赤開盤、二千五百十元為最低價、入後滙票趨緊、客戶吸收紛繁、金號銀樓帮少有供給、市價逐步激漲、午收為二千五百六十四元、下午市况仍俏、多頭買意興奮、金號錢兌業供給未暢、晚收為二千五百六十八元、收後喊八十元欲進難能、結果較上日猛漲六十八元、外幣英美金鎊、需耍甚殷、市價激升、英美金票因匯票步趨軟弱、交易驟旺、市價上升甚勁、香港票法郎票荷蘭票等、供給俱稀、市價上升皆烈、日金票頗穩定、仍為九角九分二厘、朝鮮票供給復稀、市價為九角二分、公會交易頗稀、僅寶祥出祥泰進美金票一千元、昨日市價、英金鎊升一元三角、英金票升一元五角、美金鎊升一元七角、美余票升三角九分、香港票升八分、法郎票升七厘、新加坡票升一角一分、荷蘭票升九分、安南票升五分、羅比票升七分、加拿大票升二角八分、斐律濱票升一角、澳金票升八角、僅義大利票德金票暹羅票未更、</p>
<h3>美停購白銀　海外銀價慘落　大條近遠縮六八七五美現貨亦跌三分之鉅孟買進五十一羅比內</h3>
<p>昨接二十七日各國之銀市電訊、驟然一致慘烈暴縮、良因美國參院已通過停購國外白銀影響、致久不更動之美銀價現貨、竟亦在縮三分之巨、為三角九分七五、又英銀大條因之在投機家售出下、缺少維持、近期猛縮六八七五、遠期竟亦在縮六八七五、均已退至十九便士大關內、收市後、市轉穩、印度照掛牌價高〇六二五有進胃、又孟買印銀、一致縮入五十一羅比之內、現貨與七月均縮一羅比、八月縮一羅比一安那、市况甚疲、成交單不明云、</p>
<p>貼現步跌七元半　拆息亦小三分</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、續見下落、每千元之貼率、上午初仍盤於一百元左右、未幾步退至午刻為九十五元、下午站定米更、較前日續跌七元五角、至錢業公會之拆息、已見回低三分、懸二角二分云、</p>
<h3>紗花　結賬期漸近　紗市愈難振作　同業互做交易大為減縮行情再跌五六七元不等</h3>
<p>棉紗暗盤交易較少、但趨勢晨鬆午緊、結果二十支雙馬與上日不相上下、其他均跌三四元左右、市塲人心依然高低不一、惟一般虛浮之多頭、受銀根緊急之催促、且牛年結束之際接近、非將貨物脫卸求現、不能歸價賬目、同業互做買賣大為减縮、而某記巨戶亦有同樣之病態、在市新結較夥、故上午市價之弱、職是之故也、惟大宗心理、須待七月四日滙劃證發出登記、及消息是吾利多利空、再决雌雄、目下大都抱觀望態度也、午後開盤平平、旋聞黃金稍昂、市氣活潑、價格回升二三元、但客方實需受環境不良而滯、二十支雙馬現紗開盤價為四百七十七元、少頃跌至四百七十四兀、棧單始做四百七十三元半、後到四百七十一元、午後開平、隨聞金價回漲、又上升一步、二十支雙馬外棧現貨又做至四百七十八元、棧單價為四百七十三元、結果全日成交的計八。九百包、仍係同行成交占多數、行情雙馬平、二十支五福。牧羊均跌五七元、雙地球跌四元、特金城跌六元半、十支粗紗無軒輊云、今日出口棉紗有九十件運泉州、</p>
<p>日紗市面、交易依然冷落、惟本月份之貨可延期半月交貨、市况稍定而昂、二十支月琴紗本月份價為三百八十元至八十二元、</p>
<h3>本月份日紗交割　延長二星期</h3>
<p>自財部馬電到滬、銀錢業各行莊一體遵行後、日紗交易向係全劃頭、所有營業之手續、殊感困難、本月份即六月期之紗、月底將屆、買賣方發生糾紛之事甚繁、紗業公會運日召集同業會議討論之、結果將本月份雙方之交易、延長二星期、移至七月十四日以前履行交割淸楚云、</p>
<h3>銀行拒做押款　棉商應付困難　存貨紛紛賤售以解匯票頭寸</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日殊為堅定、開盤時頗形活潑、空頭抵補及南方購買頗衆、華盛頓方面關於以貨易貨之問題、談判進行頗為順利云、現貨商交易亦繁、結果紐約漲七八磅音、印度運同預測亦漲一羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、自政府頒令限制提存後、各銀行即拒做押款、市上因之銀根奇緊、且又値以六月底為銀行緒賬期、各洋行到船貨頗多、洋行因滙票月份關係、値此金融、亂期中、掉期過巨、折合法幣本月份滙票興下月份者相較每担貴起竟達十元之巨、各同業以籌軟困難、而洋行又催款、殷急、故祗能將存貨賤價售去、均應解滙票之用、而洋行方面亦莫不以收款困難而愁慮、雙方俱皆呌苦連天也、</p>
<p>本棉交易僅一筆成交、且數量僅八十包、生意之稀薄為所罕見、廠方受限制提軟問題、未能解决、一時不致於採辦原料、至於同業互相轉輾的買賣、亦因貨到付款問題、糾紛甚多、不易理楚、廠方予行家提貨解款之事、雖則幾度會議仍無切實之結果、前途週折多端也、蘇北來源、僅到通州花三百十一包、今日有棉花二十件運泉州、茲將現棉情形錄下、</p>
<p>下沙　美種　九三·〇〇　同業中進　八〇包滙劃棧交</p>
<p>白羅　去　八七·五〇　又　三〇〇件　鈔票又</p>
<h3>油餅　油市無法活動　豆餅續見挫落</h3>
<p>生豆油市塲因受提存影響、活動力頗覺窒礙、一般有力行商亦感尾大、一時難以周轉、故有建議對於付解貨款日期訂十天為限、（業規成交日起十五天銀期）、十天內不出淸貨、須支解八折貨款、一切責任、亦由買方負担、但有一部份未能同意、致未實行、暫仍依口頭的定履行、昨日交易紙做開神戶來連豆油二十桶、價為四十七元、比上日短削七角、</p>
<p>豆餅雖似油市一般受牽制、但本身貨價較輕、賣買易於俯仰、不過照時令推測、刻屆銷塲活潑之候、市塲中成交數量不出五千片、總之受種種環境束縛、有此特殊情形、昨市除雙方對了六月份大連源記餅三千片、價為三元原盤外、其他續見挫落、計成交源記二千片、價為二元九角七分、雜牌二千片、價為二元九角五分云、</p>
<p>昨日有豆油一百十件、蔴油五百聽、俱山烟臺來滬、又來豆餅一萬四千五百片、又由寗波來棉子餅二千片、</p>
<p>今日有生油五千三百五十聽、運往泉州、又有豆子五百八十包亦運泉州、又一百三十包、運往香港、又有豆餅二千一百片、運往泉州、</p>
<h3>證券　股市平靜</h3>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市開盤、仍見平靜、但半日交易、數種著名實業股票、見有需求、成交價格亦有進展、</p>
<p>成交及開盤市價牧盤續買價會德、股買價三三·二五　二四·二五電車股賣價　三九·五〇　四〇·五〇怡和股買價　一八·二〇　一八·九〇橡皮股市仍少興趣、但賣戶無意於此低廉之買價出售、債券市面甚為疏忽、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十七日（週二）掛牌行市、趨勢穩定、各股均無上落、倫敦中國外債本月二十七日（週二）掛牌行市、跌風暫吿戢止、各價均無繼動、市塲成交京戶鐵路公債一千鎊、做開價十六鎊、照市撳落一鎊、</p>
<h3>糧食　現鈔頭寸不寬　麺粉交易擯持　日廠活動現麥</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市客路交易、雖有取辦之意、終以現鈔頭寸缺乏、而廠方堅持現鈔交易、對於匯劃票據、槪不接受、故沉悶之局面、一時恐難打開也、至本街零批交易、則照常以四元六角五分之現鈔售價、成交亦僅數千包、洋粉到銷兩靜、自受現幣影響後、不獨客胃淸淡、即本街去路、亦見沉寂、市價約在五元國劃左右、市面亦在醞釀中、查麵粉今日有二萬八千九百包運泉州麵皮亦有一千一百包運去</p>
<p>小麥　昨日來源不絕、橡目下各地新麥、已屆呸期、適逢此决金融風潮影響、致買賣兩方均少間津、昨華粉廠去胃仍滯、而日廠及本街去化、則續吿活動、統市售開丹陽及南京采石磯等麥、共計九百餘包、價六元五角八分至五角三分、市面無甚軒輊、</p>
<h3>供過於求　米價一蹶不振</h3>
<p>杜粳　昨日各帮來源河下無到、車輪包子來常州南港等貨二千三四百包、米市自經限價後、人心即平、囤戶絕跡、而所有去路、祗本街零星之店胃、致懷貨者心虛、都所回出、市上籌碼頓現擁擠、市乃更難維持、續見貶跌、結果若厚薄粳價回落二角、</p>
<p>客秈　產地已連朝報小、且受洋米定貨影響、業外大戶客囤頗有隨市求脫、而本街以粳尖趨平、納胃已淡、內地帮昨日祇辦三四百包、而中次機米與砶米之供量時多、且有貶價求現、故昨晨開市後、步步下落、高貨小去三四角、而宿次各米則小去四五角、全日成交共計二千多包、</p>
<p>洋米　現貨交易、依然沉寂、貨方喊價二十三元之一號西貢、連費佣零配亦乏受主、後市勢必再度降削、方能售開、至於洋米新定一節、因有外匯購結與其他關係、故其實在妥交定數額不似外間所傳之鉅、據說第一批三百噸已能證實外、其第二批亦祇實成三千包云、</p>
<p>糯米　查變元米近來之脚地本軟、時値粳尖不振中、價亦一落半元、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖產價迭升　甌甬航運遭阻　國糖欲漲不能</h3>
<p>昨糖據外電報吿、均見上展、荷粗白九十月份又有收回、價為荷盾八·〇〇、香港粗白包費至申、價升至滿倉幣一一·四〇、倫敦電八月份猛升六便士二五、為八先令〇七五、十二月份升七五、為六先令五便士、明年三月份升一便士半、為六先令五便士半、故本市公會劃盤、稍見隨緊、現貨二四粗白升二角、本棧二十九元、外棧二十八元八角、轉口貨升一角、成交四百包、太古糖升一·二·三·四角不一、西棧B嘜二十八元八角、計一百包、　CW嘜二十八元六角、CX嘜二十八元四角、DY嘜二十七元八角、HY嘜二十七元六角、國糖因甌甬航運遭阻、進戶咸抱觀望、不若前幾日之激昂、某號因試探納胃起見、會售出雜路靑五十包、價為十六元、後此價不肯續售、仍有緊意、且廈鬥至申水脚、已增二成半、成本確已加昂、益以匯劃貼水關係、其緊度不言可喻、興化普通大宮粉、呌二十七元、未成交、今日有糖一萬五千包自嗬來、</p>
<h3>絲茶　意國人絲又有到</h3>
<p>人造絲又有大批到滬、前日（二十七日）意輪康梯皮安克孟諾號、自意國運來二千七百四十五箱、起卸於紅口公和祥棧房、中並有秋季毛織西裝料、九十五箱、（祖）</p>
<h3>海疆不靖　綠茶歐銷愈俏</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶市况、愈形鋒俏、良以邇來沿海形勢緊張、內地紅綠茶輸出、益感困難、滬市存貨、因之更見珍貴、英商怡和協和同孚保昌等行、一致紛起搶辦、珍眉交易、異常暢旺、細針眉亦趨活動、全市成交綠茶共計七百四十餘箱、抽芯售價自二百九十五元至三百三十二元、統珍售價自二百五十三元至二百七十六元、針眉售價自五十二元至八十八元、</p>
<h3>五金　白鐵管價高陰銷路</h3>
<p>白鐵管銷塲、向以自來水廠為最大、外埠天津·北平·靑島·烟台·福州·寗波·等處、均有交易、自去年因現貨軋缺後、標準飛漲、但終因開價太高、致實銷大受打擊、嚴近現貨紛紛裝到、而買戶仍少、速日開出除少數門市零星外、大批生意殊屬稀見、最近開價如四吩每呎售四角八分、六吩每呎五角八分、一吋八角、一吋四吩一元四角、二吋一元八角五分、三吋三元三角、均比前市漲起一二角及八九角不等、</p>
<h3>進出口　荷囒南洋到貨甚多</h3>
<p>昨日荷囒有大宗貨物來滬、計生粉三千四百包、又白蠟八千包、椰子壳三千一百六十包、又由南洋運來胡椒一百五十包、樹皮橡皮五百五十箱、茄菲二百九十箱、</p>

<h3>日艦結集沿海　滬浙閩交通暫阻　鎮海口封鎖綫準備堵塞福州航綫似亦限於停頓</h3>
<p>英美艦擬護航</p>
<p>自海軍當局、通知第三國船只、禁駛閩甌口岸後、所有駛溫外輸、均已停航、留溫之意商康沙義號、亦於昨晨駛滬、福州方面、則有英輪神福·神光·兩輪泊川石缷貨、甯波封鎖後、謀福輪准續駛一班、該輪定今晨啟椗、明晨即行返滬、鎮海口封鎖綫、必要時將實施堵塞、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>日圖封鎖閩甌口岸</p>
<p>日海軍當局、於廿六日會通知上海各國領事團、調日軍將在溫州及福州口岸、採取軍事行動、故請第三國戰艦及商船、一律於廿九日（即今日）午刻悉數駛離以上地點、否則發生任何捐害、日方將不負責云云、但是英美當局、對日方該項照會、已予堅決拒絕、將向日方提出嚴重交涉、又據日方聲稱、閩甌兩地出入口處、將佈置危險物品、實施封鎖、其危險物之設置位置、（一）溫州沙頭水道東部南北水道之中央部、（二）福州燙斗水道東部中央浮簡附近、普飭凡居住於此等地域之第三國人、應從速避難、但據大光社記者向航業界探詢、均稱未接到該項消息之任何電告、至昨某報載溫州禁航、係奉華軍當局命令、顯係悮傳、蓋航業界始終未接當局有關禁航之通知也、</p>
<p>謀福今晨最後駛甬</p>
<p>甬防守司令為加強鎮海口要塞防務、業已決定禁止通航、泊甬之新北京·德平·謀福·三輪、均經於廿七日晨駛滬抵埠、惟德商禮和洋行之謀福輪、經特准續駛一班、作最後一次之航行、該輪已定今晨四時、由滬啟椗、當晚抵甬、預定明晨即行返滬、俟該輪駛離甯波後、鎮海口即宣告正式封鎖、留備堵塞缺口之老太平輪、據大光社記者獲得可靠消息、已有下沉準備、必要時、即將實施、又太古公司新北京輪、現已派航新航綫林求·秀渡、定明日（三十日）上海十時開航、</p>
<p>意輪離溫各輪停航</p>
<p>自日方阻撓外輪駛溫後、留溫之海福輪、業於前日下午到滬、哈納輪亦於昨日下午抵埠、意商康沙義輪、則於昨晨八時離溫駛滬、現甌江已無外輪踪跡、至原定駛溫之飛康·寶利·恩德·及到滬之海福·哈納·等各輪、均宣告暫時停航、須視局勢如何、再行決定、</p>
<p>神福神光泊閩缷貨</p>
<p>至於福州航綫除英商怡隆公司派有輪只常川行駛外、其餘太古·怡和、及中意公司等、均為無定期班、業於日前先後駛閩、並電告安抵馬尾港外之川石停泊、照常缷貨、一俟完竣、即行返滬、今後是否再開、亦將視情形如何而定、英商太古公司之涼州輪、原定昨日行駛新開泉州附近之秀者、因閩江日軍登陸之傳說、乃緩期一日、現準於今晨駛秀、惟福州航綫、似亦停頓狀態、</p>
<p>玉環海島無關軍事</p>
<p>浙江之玉環縣、係一海島、四面臨海、在軍事上並無重要性、與定海縣性質相同、此次日軍之在玉環坎門登陸、不過恫嚇而已、如欲由玉環進犯樂清、殊非易事、況樂清與海門及溫州、雖有公路可通、但已駐紮重兵、戒備森嚴、當日軍登陸之後、曾遭玉環自衛團警猛烈之抵抗、</p>
<p>日艦集中形勢緊張</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向航業界探悉、浙閩沿海各地駐軍均已奉命嚴密戒嚴、防止日軍之偷渡登陸、今浙閩沿海之閩江口及甌江口、有大批日艦集中有所企圖、所以沿海形勢、緊張萬分、各地信軍必要時採用緊急之設施·又浙東樂清·溫州、連日均遭日機之轟炸、</p>
<p>英美準備竭力護航</p>
<p>英美各國對於日海軍封鎖中國沿海阻撓航行、堅決表示予以拒絕、英駐軍總領事已於前日提出答復「日主不得無論直接間接危害英生命產業、規避任何責任云」、又聞英商太古怡和怡隆等輪船公司、為維護中國沿海航行計、決照常維持原有航綫、必要時請英艦實行護航、</p>
<h3>北沙綫義行輪　英艦護送回滬</h3>
<p>青龍港外日艦勒阻外輪前進上港航運銳減各公司籌對付</p>
<p>北沙方面發生戰事、新港靈甸港迭遭日艦砲轟、外商各輪雖照航行、惟終止地已改在青龍港、客貨銳減、營業大受影響、勢將被迫停駛、日方此舉目的、在壟斷航運及攫奪各港貨稅、惟華軍決予日軍嚴重打擊、茲探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>北沙德輪改泊青龍</p>
<p>英商太古公司萬通輪、實行停航後、德商遠東公司海宜輪、福華公司江定輪、於昨晨七時照常開出、客貨並不因之減少、當於二時許、經過滸通港、豎積港、牛洪港、安然駛抵青龍港、鳴放汽笛、放出划船、將客貨缷駁進港、泊於海面三十二號日艦、仍打旗語、勒令各輪停泊該處過夜、阻撓前進、並將砲對準兩輪示威、兩輪船主逐打銷上航計劃、定今晨駛抵上海、英商怡和公司之義和輪、則有英艦保護、由上港駛回、於昨日下午二時抵滬、自日軍封鎖北沙綫上港後、各輪營業銳減、損失頗重、故各公司將磋商應付辦法、</p>
<p>日方目的壟斷航運</p>
<p>日方覬覦北沙航運、原非一日、早存壟斷這意、此次籍日軍行動、阻撓外商各輪、純為便利日清公司派輪航行、蓋外商各輪、均以日軍佔據之青龍港為終點、對於港口客貨、自不能與日輪相竸爭、結果將被迫自動停航、同時北沙綫之稅收、日軍亦可搜刮攫取也、</p>
<h3>銀行業辦理半年決算</h3>
<p>各銀行經營謹慎均護盈餘　籌碼增加此後金融愈穩定</p>
<p>明日（六月三十日）為銀行半年決算期、銀行業連日辦理結賬、甚多繁忙、儲蓄商業兩部結息已竣、準七月一日起、休假三天、自爭錢業議決安定市面辦法後、金融市場、已趨穩定、俟半年決算後、銀行準備會辦理領用同業滙劃、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>半年結賬</p>
<p>各銀行鑒於六月三十日銀行半年決算將屆、均已開始辦理結賬事宜、各視業務之繁忙、對內延長辦公時間、儲蓄部結息、以二十日為止、商業部結息、以二十五日為止、今已先後辦理完竣、連日易姓韋解驟忙、票據交換所之票據交換數額亦增、各行依照公會規定、自七月一日起休假三天、四日起照常開市營業、銀行公會之半年會員代表大會、今經常務委員會議決、中止召集、</p>
<p>市場穩定</p>
<p>上海金融市場、至今尚能保持傳統之重要性、如國際滙兌、仍以上海為中心、而內地資金、復集中於上海、於是銀行存款激增、致資金有過剩之趨勢、今年春季、因上海缺乏正當運用之途徑、於是發生不正當之投機事業、如套買外匯·囤積貨物等、一般紛向銀行提存、經營此不正當營業、幸經財政部馬電、限制提存、因此投機事業、因缺乏法幣而漸戰、金融市場趨穩定、</p>
<p>均獲盈餘</p>
<p>戰後之滬市工商各業、因人口激增、需要驟殷、均呈畸形發展現象、如在特區內之大小工廠新設及恢復開工者、已增至二千七八百家、同時新設商店、亦如雨後春筍、殊形發達、各銀行對於工商各業資金需要、在可能範圍內、莫不儘量接受抵押借款、故本屆半年決算、一般預料、均能獲得相當盈餘、</p>
<p>籌碼增加</p>
<p>銀行聯合準備委員會、已開始辦理同業領用匯劃、登記、凡欲領取匯劃之行莊、應提供擔保品、向該會申請領用、準七月四日起實行、並聯該會為便利同業匯劃這授受起見、得發行同業滙劃證、但領用同業滙劃及發行滙劃證、雖同為滙劃性質、略有不同、目前祇有領用同業滙劃、暫不發行匯劃證、是項滙劃制度之改良、實於整個工商業受益匪淺、能使市場增加有確實擔保之籌碼、</p>
<p>資金充裕</p>
<p>領用同業匯劃總額、暫定為五千萬元、自實行之後、能使各銀行之財產、如貨物證券房地產等、成為匯劃新籌碼、同時各行莊存於銀行準備會及錢業準備庫之匯劃、准予按百分之九十五、分十二星期掉成法幣、則行莊之資金、益趨充裕、能儘量扶助之工商業之發展、惟為杜絕不正當之投機事業計、銀行準備委員會、此後決中止辦理同業滙劃貼現、並希望錢兌業亦停止經營滙劃貼現、</p>

<p>料理欠款</p>
<p>關於該行社之各債務、已委託徐士浩律師催告、從速料理欠款、茲錄通告略云、據上海市銀行·上海市興業信託·代表人稱、本行社對於人欠款項、亟應積極追償、為特委請貴律師登報催告、各債務人限二十日內、備款向貴事務所將所欠本利、如數理楚、逾期即請依法訴追等語前來、相應代表登報、忂告各債務人知照、希依限料理、幸勿延誤為要、</p>
<h3>嚴厲執行限價後　米價逐日回跌</h3>
<p>投機奸商一籌莫展急於脫手米商訂購洋米三千噸已成交</p>
<p>豆米市場自經工部局訂定二十一元限價、並派遺人員馳赴市場監督、不得再行逾限買賣、中次各米、亦經米業團體聯度會議規定標準價格、市場人心、即告安定、秩序亦復常態、米市場因晶來黃霉已屆、並由當局嚴厲執行限價、一般投機奸商、一籌莫展、無法可施、紛紛求售、惟市場納胃較遜、致供過於求、且因天時轉晴、市面乃呈跌多漲少之勢、</p>
<p>昨晨市場</p>
<p>九時開盤、十二時收盤、厚薄粳又回跌二三角、蘆羊尖及白元各跌二角、上午市場共成交五千擔左右、據米業界預測、日內米價或將再行下跌、昨日水陸兩路</p>

<p>本社社員、自應絕對遵守、倘有逾限買賣、而受處罰、本社概不負責、議決在案、特此通告、昨據某米業領袖告悉、本市少數米業行號、復經委託達孚洋行續訂、</p>

<h3>工部局董事會核准　增加職員津貼　分匯兌津貼與生活津貼兩種局方全年增加開支一百餘</h3>
<p>本年二月間、工部局董事會通過該局之職員滙兌津貼及生活費津貼問題委員會報吿書、並决定於六月底以前、將臨時生活費津貼等重行考慮、均經公布在案、查自木年一月一日起、該局之「B」「L」兩級職員、各領生活費津貼百分之十五、此項津貼、經上述之委員曾認為合乎情理、且比當時本埠各機關所給之津貼為優、因此未有變更、至於「A」級職員、曾經董事會通過、准如該委員會所擬辦法、除就其基本薪金之三分之一給予滙兌津貼外、幷就其薪金之三分之二，發給與「B」「L」兩級職員同等之生活費津貼、</p>
<p>匯兌津貼辦法照舊</p>
<p>本星期一叙委員會開會時、會將津貼問題、詳細討論、各委員舉决、請董事會准「A」級職員仍按原定辦法、領受滙兌津貼、惟改以國幣一元合英金六辨士為標準、</p>
<p>生活津貼酌予提高</p>
<p>關於「B」「L」兩級職員、（包括執有聘書之華籍職員在內）之生活津貼、及「A」級職員薪金之三分之二部份所加津貼、各委員議决、請董事會准自百分之十五提高至百分之二十五、此項津貼、當於本年九月底重行復核、</p>
<p>按照需要考量待遇</p>
<p>各委員會表示工部局不能因職員生活費之增加、而負担全部責任、惟各該職員應與納稅人共同負担、各該職員如欲獲得經濟上之補助、俾其生活程度能與櫃價在一先令二辨士叉八分之三時相等、實屬不合情理、工部局財務處長曾謂增加生活津貼問題、最好能於查明本年上半年度賬目及局方之財政狀况以後、再行考量、但銓叙委員會認為局方應按照社會情形、隨時考量職員之待遇、以紹公允、近來生活費之增加、自應為局方所顧及、以便决定如何補助職員、</p>
<p>普通華員均予津貼</p>
<p>未執有聘書之華籍職員津貼問題、亦經銓叙委員會考量、該會議决請董事會將現行之分等辦法廢止、所有屬於該類職員、其姓名列於各處薪金單上者、應一律准領津貼百分之二十、此項津貼亦應於本年九月底以前復核、</p>
<p>全年支出一百餘萬</p>
<p>據財務處長估計、此項所擬加發之滙兌津貼及生活費津貼、如以英令滙價自八辨士降至六辨士半為標準、全年所需支出、共計的國幣一·一九二·七〇〇元、其分類如下、</p>
<p>「A」級職員滙兌津貼（假定滙價六辨士半）</p>
<p>二三五·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>生活費津貼（基本薪金之百分之十六·六七）</p>
<p>一一三·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>「B」「L」兩級職員生活費津貼</p>
<p>外籍三五〇·四〇〇元</p>
<p>華籍五三·〇〇〇元未執有聘書之華籍職員生活費津貼四四一·三〇〇元</p>
<p>上項預計支出、的合市政總捐及地稅之十六分之一、滙兌津貼標準、倘未减低至七辨士以下、最近滙價之變動、當使全年滙兌津貼增加一二三·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>上述之各項建議、業經工部局董事會本月二十八日例會通過</p>

<h3>日本國內經濟　已至山窮水盡階段　薙刀片鋼筆尖均溶造軍火東京已呈杌隉不安之氣氛</h3>
<p>香港德臣西報云、日軍對華作戰、幾達兩載之後、今隨處可見日本於經濟上與財政上行將智窮力竭之象、此種局勢、頃突趨劇烈、日本缺乏金錢與物質、同由來已久、此似為一國交戰時正常的經濟緊縮、初無可異、但時至今日、日本之每一種經濟的氣壓機已示危險信號矣、職是之故、中立觀察家均相信日木今方藉第三國審愼謀致解决所調中國事變之說今日日本之</p>
<p>內部情景</p>
<p>約略如下、（一）食物。政府現按口發給牛乳。白塔油·蛋。及其他必要食物、美國加州檸檬一枚、費洋三角、然縱出此價、亦無從購得、食物總平均之消費一年內高漲百分之十三、較前年七月七日軍興時已高漲百分之廿三、（二）物質·舊薙刀片與用剩之鋼筆失、均溶解以供製造軍火、鍋爐人孔蓋萬千具、已用木質者代之、</p>
<p>零售市塲</p>
<p>棉質與毛質布匹均巳絕跡、蔬菜纖維作代用物之企圖、未吿成功、（三）商業藝妓界之盈餘至微、銀行已奉令减低小商人借款之利率、統制價格而不統制薪給、巳迫使許多小商人破產、並已組織特別代理機關、協助小商人改業、（四）金融。日兀近在距離最近的外匯市塲上海跌至</p>
<p>空前低價</p>
<p>金質物件之强迫登記、刻正開始、公司用票面低微之公債代現款而發津貼、大藏省近對一九三八年之採命表示「失望」、四月份日本未向美國購買戰其分文、凡此種種、遂產生兩種顯著之事實、一即日本貯藏之外幣卒已降至最低數、而取最嚴峻之辦法、使根本</p>
<p>不得外流</p>
<p>一即日本國內已釀成通貨膨脹狀况、日本在戰時之間題、乃根本的難題、日本缺少存亡攸關之富源、故於油·鐵·煤·棉·羊毛·紙漿·及化學物品、多須仰給於外國、此類物品日本幾以全須以硬幣現款購買而以本國之船運回為條件、購得之、所購數量甚巨、如是者已將屆兩栽矣、至於他國貸予日本之信用放款、</p>
<p>爲數甚微</p>
<p>各國商人均須獲得現款、始任輪船載貨赴日、至三月卅一日財政年度告終時、日常局雖守極嚴格之秘密、惟大衆已知金融界對於國內外幣與黃金之缺乏、將起恐慌矣、關於一九三八年朝鮮臺灣與日木產金之數量、常然無數字公佈、故</p>
<p>未能確知</p>
<p>估計其年產數的為六千五百元左右、但觀於藏相石渡對產金之失望、金融界對於去歲產金之是否臻此數字、仍懷疑慮、官方統計表示、一九三八年日本輸往美國之黃金、較一九三七年的少百分之三十二、（未完）</p>

<p>西園寺本係蘇州著名古剎、住持僧名龍安、於民國十年分租賃公共租界愛文義路四七六號巨廈、（三開間兩廂房三埭共計樓房十幢）、設立蘇州西園寺上海分院、派儈人印眞為住持、內有客帮僧三四十人、香伙為吉維章（鹽城人年四十四歲）係蘇州西園寺之老香伙、由印眞僧調滬充任、吉之兩子長名貴生、决名連生、均在該分院為茶房、平日經懺頗盛、八一三滬戰發生後、該住持佾因收入銳减、無法維持、遂將該分院全部房屋、分租與由內地避難來滬之難胞居住、共計租進四十餘家、每月租金收入為數不貲、藉以支持、嗣因市面安全、租界人口激增、商業畸形發展、佛事漸見起色、住持僧遂下逐客之令、奈一般房客、均因覓屋困難、遲延不遷、經住持僧百般設法、始遷出三分之二、尙有十餘家房客、至今未遷、</p>
<p>炸彈爆發傷斃香伙</p>
<p>該分院香伙吉維章之臥房、係在第二埭西廂房後間、係一人居住、吉之二子住在樓下、前（二十七）晚吉於十時左右入房安睡、詎至咋晨一時三十分鐘時、吉之房內、忽發生巨響、合寺僧俗、均於睡夢中驚醒、其時正大雨如注、分赴吉之臥房査看、祇見吉之兩手已炸去、周身均遭炸傷、頭面之肉、均已炸去、血肉糢糊、慘不忍覩、業已斃命、墻壁亦炸倒、吉之屍體、被壓在磚瓦下、</p>
<p>報吿捕房扒出屍體</p>
<p>住持僧印眞査見之下、知係炸彈爆炸、立即投報新閘捕房、捕頭立率大批中西探捕到塲、將吉之屍體從瓦礫中扒出、車送騐屍所候騐、並在屋內檢獲形似香烟罐之洋銀皮碎片、除在該分院前後房屋査看一過外、並派華印捕各一名、在內駐守、詎至昨日（二十八）日上午十一時一刻、該分院第二埭西廂房前半間（係空屋向無人居）忽又發生巨響、墻壁上之石灰、狼藉滿地、因無人居住、並未傷人、祇炸壞檯凳及擺設事件、</p>
<p>探捕搜査拘去數人</p>
<p>駐守之巡捕、復赴捕房報吿、捕頭於下午三時一刻鐘、立派大批探捕三十餘人馳往、將該分院內所有僧俗人等、分別監視行動、分赴樓上下房客及僧人住房實施査抄一過、並詳加盤詰後、因見住居前埭西廂房之房客喬姓夫婦、及僧人數人、形跡可疑、一併帶入捕房侯核、</p>

<h3>最新的維他命E</h3>
<p>— 明初</p>
<p>世界各國的醫生和化學家最近曾在倫敦會集，討論最新的維他命——維他命E，這種維他命可以在麥芽和棉子裹取得，現在且能在化驗室裹配合各種成份而製造維他命E。</p>
<p>據英國傑索普婦科醫院的麥唐納醫師說曾有十八個婦人，沒有維他命E治療前，共懷孕五十三此，產出的嬰孩，祗五個是活的，自從服用了維他命E之後，她們已產出了十七個活的嬰孩了。</p>
<p>其他科學家也表示相信，通常的懷孕，做母親的食物裹應該含有充分的維他命E，實在是絕對必要的。他們還引例證，說是有些婦女，因為產出的嬰孩，從來沒有活的，所以鬱鬱不樂，服用維他命E之後，有很多已做了母親了。</p>
<p>哥平哈根的摩勒醫師說，用維他命E治療慣有的流產症，一百起中，有七十五至八十起是成功的，摩醫師還說這種新維他命，對於農夫，也有裨益，因為以前不產犢的母牛，用維他命E來治療，百分之七十五已得到滿意的結果。</p>
<p>此外，還有人宣佈新發現說，維他命似乎不但對生育有影響，且可助長發育呢。</p>
<h3>黃梅時節話衣服</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>白糖梅子在每個衙堂裹的呼喊聲，好像逐漸消沉下去了，誠然，時令過得真快，沒有被採下來和白糖同拌的青梅子已披上了一件赭黃的外衣，梅子黃了，黃梅時節又道了！</p>
<p>說道黃梅，真有些頭痛，整天的雨，滿空充實着水蒸汽，別的不打緊，很有些擔心，有幾件衣服不要在這黃梅時節毀損了。黃梅是害蟲，細菌繁殖的好機會，前年冬天，就會開了破洞，糊裡糊塗，去年祗能重新買過，我只恨這些侵襲我衣服的害蟲，　傷我經濟的害蟲，不去捉它，殺死它，除盡它，那還了得，錢源源的溜出去，一身衣服總不成樣子，東破西補，還談得到整潔嗎？</p>
<p>衣服的材料是纖維質占多數，羊毛衣飾蛋白質做成的，蛋白質剛好是害蟲最稱心的食物，其餘像絨毛衣裳，也是一樣的軟弱，沒有抵抗力，難免被害蟲侵蝕，雖然有許多衣服特別加工製造，防止害蟲侵犯，可是太貴了，不能供給一般大眾的需要。</p>
<p>棉麻和人造絲所製成的衣服，是不像羊毛那般，容易受害蟲侵犯，綢亦也比貿易好些，但是，到此黃梅時節，還免不了要發癥。</p>
<p>毛衣的害蟲，在夏天從孵化成幼蟲，這幼蟲在冬天就侵害衣服，明年春季夏節再變蛹，或化娥，甲蟲，娥和甲蟲又產卵，因此我們的毛衣服就是這些循環不息繁殖着的害蟲的好處所，我們要完全消滅它，趁此黃梅是吉恩極宜進行，不能再遲疑哪！</p>
<p>洗刷，熨帖，烘乾，三種方法可以殺掉大部份幼蟲，最好用冷藏法，普通有人用樟腦丸揮發油想防止害蟲，甚至想殺害它，這是不可能的。</p>
<p>黃梅時節是微菌最活躍的時期，在科學家測驗過，江南地方一到花更美時節，適度占空氣75%溫度20度－30度是挺死發徵了，我們要預防發徵就得注意：　除去衣服上面的污點，　放在溫度低的地方，但須乾燥，　把衣服密封，最簡便的方法，把衣服弄乾淨放在乾燥的地方算最妥當了。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>鱔魚已上市多時，近來價格不貴，我的經濟菜單中，也該有它的位置了。鱔魚的模樣兒，活像是一條蛇，所以膽小的人，就不敢吃，然而愛吃的人，依然是很多的。鱔魚的煮法很多，最普通的是炒鱔面，將整尾的鱔魚劃成了絲，出骨，與扁菩絲同炒，略加菱粉，吃的時候，再加麻油，和胡椒粉，很為可口，。倘買不到扁菩時，就以萵苣切絲為代；亦無不可。在這炒鱔糊的名目下，又可分出兩種，醫師炒鱔背，那就是專用鱔的背部切絲，肉頭較硬。一時炒鱔片，那不過不切絲而切成片罷了。這兩種的煮法，與炒鱔糊同。此外將整尾的鱔魚，切成了段，與豬肉一同紅燒，加大蒜頭若干瓤，所用糖與醬油，愛吃厚味的人一定很歡迎的。還有一個煮法，四將鱔絲放在熟油中爆過，然後做湯，與鱔魚紅燒肉同時下飯的佳品。</p>

<h3>汽車夫與行路安全運動</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>據說最近租界方面，路口日多，每一條馬人上面，行人接踵，擠扎不堪，結果汽車的殺人肇禍案件，死傷的數字，在過去的一年中，竟造成了空前未有的記錄。所以關心交通問題者聯合各界，舉行一次安全運動。城市愈熱鬧，交通愈擁擠，汽車底下死傷的人數也愈多，原是不易的定理。這個問題，就是歐美各國雖非常注意，但也不能使汽車肇禍案件在實際上能夠減少。其實要求汽車下面死傷者的數字減少，除了行路者各自當心而外汽車夫對於安全問題，是應負過半以上的責任。</p>
<p>汽車肇了禍，使行人死傷之後，法庭雖有各種罰則，但這無非是治標之計，帶有消極性質。實際上不會使禍事減少。何況有許多汽車夫，肇了禍，所判的罰金，每由車主代償，於車夫並無損失，結果也許會使汽車夫養成了一種萬一肇禍，死傷了行人，至多使主人拿出一些錢來賠償損失或撫恤死者，是滿不在乎。因此，我們除了希望法庭對於肇禍的車輛，訂有嚴厲的罰則而外；治本之計，却要使每一個汽車夫明瞭自己對行路安全運動應負的責任。在可能範圍以內，切不可使行人死傷。</p>
<p>據一般研究安全問題的人所見到的，一個汽車夫，使他所駕的汽車，不大肇禍，至少要注意下面十條戒律。（一）把汽車開到馬路上面，應時時不失統馭的力量，假如一刹那間，看見前面有車輛行人，而來不及刹車，就可肇事。（二）應當時常查看自己所駕的汽車，是否沒有算壞或弊病。（三）車子在馬路上行駛，視線須始終集中在路面上，一秒鐘的疏忽，就可釀成一次大禍。（四）駕駛汽車，除有禍患發生，或萬不得已外切不可越入右邊的人行道上。（五）車輛前進的時候，切不可開駛太緩任意逗留，以阻他人車輛的行進。（六）駕駛汽車，正和住在家裹一樣，當由謙讓之心，前面有汽車行駛，切勿自誇技熟而要越過他們。（七）市內一切交通規則，應逐一知悉。（八）駕駛汽車，如有機件或汽油發生窒礙，應細心處理，不可暴躁。（九）酒後不可駕車。（十）當地的地圖，也應研究，以節省駛車時間，或避開過分熱鬧的馬路。上海的安全運動展開了，敢以上面的十誡貢獻全市汽車夫，而車主的自己駕車，不雇車夫的，對此十條誡例，也未始不可作為參考呢！</p>

<h3>吃飯難</h3>
<p>— 方之</p>
<h3>竈披間裏</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>在上海，無論是「一上一下」或「兩上兩下」的房子，總有著這麼個灶披間，位處後門內旁，亭子間下面，樓梯墻后。若論面積，塞不下兩隻八仙桌。既名灶披間，無疑是廚房之所在了。然上海乃聞名的「寸金地」，戰前猶難找獨門獨戶的，何況戰後兩租界擁有五百萬人口之多呢！「一上一下」房子起碼也得住三份人家，普通四五家，多至七八家的都有，「兩上兩下」數當倍之。灶披間正和露臺自來水一樣，二房東聲明在先，是特許公用的。</p>
<p>於是小小的灶披間裹就變成「公共租界地」，熱鬧非當了。行灶，廣東風爐，煤球灶，還有用火油箱改造的爐子，一隻一隻一次排列，像開「展覽會」，牆壁上槌着鐵釘，各種大大小小的鍋子掛着，有鋼精質的，有熟鐵質的，有銅質的……瓦質的砂鍋掛不住，着地放著，裏面也許還剩着些湯湯水水。各人家一架碗櫥，也佔據著「領空」。一盞五支光電燈被油膩燻蒸得像頑皮孩子的臉，烏漆黑黑，二房東每年在「大掃除」日給它洗抹一次，此外就常年不見其「廬山真面」了。還有那扇臨街堂的玻璃窗，亦然如此。</p>
<p>所以當你走進灶披間時，頭上腳下須鄭重小心，額頭給碗櫥木腳撞了是非常痛楚的。腳下呢，東西格外多，炭簍，木箱，鉛桶，銅吊，火鉗，小菜藍……等等，幾乎教你步步荊棘，被繹個　子翻身不算，踏壞人家舊東西，可非照價賠償新的不可。何況灶披間地上統年泥濘載道，容易打滑，天地良心說句話；除掉二房東，誰都不屑注意自來水龍頭究竟關上了沒有？倒是有關乎公德的。</p>
<p>從早上十點鐘開始，直到午後一點鐘，便是灶披間的全盛時代，二房東太太或娘姨，前樓嫂嫂，後樓好婆，亭子間阿姨，閣樓上阿姊……先後從小菜場回來，集中在灶披間，於是大會開始了，各人先報告物價，次則檢查籃裹的貨色，然後加以評定；前樓嫂嫂買的黃魚便宜，後樓好婆買的明蝦新鮮，……假使你要聽魚肉菜行情的漲落，灶披間裹會給你準確的報告。</p>
<p>唯其灶披間形成為「公共租界地」，一些小糾紛是免不了的。譬如誰家鹽缽裹少了鹽，或是碗櫥裹鳳尾魚只剩下頭……就得指桑駡槐的罵將起來，雖屬無的之矢，非平平心頭之氣不可。只要大家勿多心，亦容易有事化為無事。賢明的主婦在灶披間裹：「只燒自家鍋內菜，莫管他家淡和鹹。」就會免掉不少是非。可別看灶披間這小小地方，却是一日三餐的來源地。同時亦為複雜社會之雛型。</p>

<h3>再說文壇上的「謀略」</h3>
<p>— 吐老</p>
<p>關於文壇上的「謀略」，還想來說幾句。</p>
<p>其實拿訟師來比作家，也還是不怎樣恰當的。我們有些作家，木領却已經超過訟師了。訟師的玩「謀略」，畢竟還是為人而不是為己，而且目的也很簡單，不過混一口飯吃而已。作家却就不然。他們是切身問題，「謀略」一成，名利雙收。這呌作「時勢造英雄」。</p>
<p>所以就一向文壇上出現的「謀略」看來，不但名目繁多，而且花樣翻新，進步得非常神速，還跟着時代飛跑。</p>
<p>自吹自捧，或者僱人喝道，已經太陳腐了。一條啟事，或者幾對匿名信，也已經不出奇了。甚至在自辦的刊物上出一個駡某名人的特輯，再把該刋物寄給被駡者，要求得一决回罵，也都呌人看得不耐頗了。於是便有更藝術的，更「烟士披里純」的「謀略」出世。</p>
<p>那「謀略」，纔是眞正超過訟師式的「謀略」的謀略。那不是給人起諢名，而是給自己起諢名。方法是：就由自己打着鑼呌了出來，說，「你們看！我是自卑在者。」或者說，「你們看！我是第幾種人。」但只是說也不行的，接着必須要表演一下。要是「自卑在者」，便一定裝些可憐相，製造些被人欺侮的材料，最好還是被女人欺侮的材料，甚至自已替女人做一兩篇駡自已的文章都行。要是「第幾種人」，便一定擺出超然的面孔，表示自已只忠於自己底藝術，而且最好是從外國底作家中尊出一個「不睬政治」的人物，又從古典文學中找出一篇說羣衆無用的文獻，那就更加聳動一時。</p>
<p>然而這並不算是最進步的「謀略」，因為個人的招牌打得實在太過明顯了一點。最進步的謀略」却還有另外的一類。</p>
<p>臂如大衆文學抬頭的時候，你要是公開地反對，那是很不方便的，於是便從別一方面下手，說靑年作家文章裏的字彙太少了，應該從新去尋一通纔成，但所指定的能尋出字彙的書籍，却是古得厲害的古董，和大衆隔得速得很，這便晤暗地達到自己底目的了。又譬如抗戰文學成了大家共同努力的方向的時候，你要是公開地反對，那更是很不方便的，於是便想出了別一種辦法，說眼前的作品統統是「抗戰八股」，這自然表面上還像是希望有好的抗戰文學的，但事實上却是一脫離抗戰的主題，便只有搭到「和平」的主題上去，這便又暗暗地達到自已底目的了。</p>
<p>試問，像這樣的「謀略」，訟師們怎麼能比得上呢？</p>
<p>嗚呼，訟師往矣，作家能完成「謀略」的藝衛到如此地步，眞可使人驚歎之至！但我有一點焦慮的是：精力畢竟是有限的，作家只用盡心機去研究謀略，勢必弄得沒有辦法去從事寫作。訟師雖然沒出息，但一生總還寫了許多狀子，我只怕我們作家結果連訟師也不如！</p>
<h3>別離歌</h3>
<p>— 谷斯範</p>
<p>在於潛</p>
<p>一天在我朋友琪的聞壁，搬來了兩個女孩子，大的一個態度溫淑莊重，小的一個智着前劉海，活潑有趣，她們把門板搭成床鋪，被單四週圍着作帳子，地板上用稻草鋪地，是她們的朋友一個風度很雅緻的美少年的床位。他們都是浙江靑年戰時工作團的同學，兩個女的由省會派到浙皖邊境的於潛縣來，男的送她們到此地，逗留一二天，便準備到蘇常一帶去，他是新四軍的淪陷區情報員。</p>
<p>他們愛笑愛鬧愛唱歌，簡直沒有停歇的時候。鬧了一個晚上，但第二天一淸早，又不知溜到什麼地方去玩了。我們起身的時候，外面靜得什麼似的，走過他們的房間，但見滿地。是稻草屑，花生壳，還零亂地丟着幾本書：「大衆哲學」「生死塲」「文藝陣地」。琪的夫人笑着說：</p>
<p>『這像個什麼樣兒？』</p>
<p>『狗窠；』我開玩笑地回答</p>
<p>琪記起什麼似的說：</p>
<p>『那小的一個像露露，一樣的前劉海和活潑，單聽她的杭州音，也會使人想起小時候的露露。』</p>
<p>『為什麼我並不這樣想？」我說。</p>
<p>『因為你在上海遇見她的時候，她已經大了。』</p>
<p>是的，那時她，已做了許多孩子的先生，而且我們沒有見了幾决面就分別，到現在算來巳快三年。去年秋天，我從上海去長沙，途經金華，才知道她結了婚，從結婚照上意外地看到她的丈夫也是我的朋友，五年前我在上海北四川路一個中學唸書的時候，他是學校裹的敎務員，後來和一個小學部女敎師的戀愛破裂，離開學校，誰也不知道他已飄流到那裏去了。</p>
<p>今年春天，又經金華，朋友們說起他們結婚不久就別離，露露進了新四軍的敎導營，她的丈夫加人了江南的游擊隊，但現在，露露快畢業了，而他巳死在一决敵人的圍攻裏。她寫信給金華的朋友。</p>
<p>『我不相信這是眞的，難道這果然是眞的嗎？……給我勇氣生活下去……』</p>
<p>我把這事情吿訴琪，琪也寫了一封信安慰她：</p>
<p>『聽說你為你的不幸而悲哀，我感到需要為你寫信，因為我是你的老友之一，猜過來，你的悲哀不久會克服，像其他的入經歷着同一的變故一樣。入原來有報情，也有理智，會激動，也會鎭靜，何况在你的面前，還擺着偉大的工作呢！』</p>
<p>但我相信，露露會在苦難中堅强起來。正如那我們的不相微的鄰舍，像露露的人，這樣嬌養慣的小姐，也能够離開了淪亡的家鄕，穿着軍用棉大衣，奔波於陌生的地方。</p>
<p>我不久就離開了於潛。</p>
<p>離於潛的前夜，我們喝了過多的酒，熄了燈，但誰也睡不去。琪很興奮，背着杜甫的「明日隔山岳，世事兩茫茫」的詩句。</p>
<p>『你什麼時候再來呢？』琪的夫人問。</p>
<p>『浙贛路不斷的話，過半年就會來。』我回答。</p>
<p>「你不要信他！」琪狂喊着：『廣西離此地有三千里！而且即使他來，我們還會在於潛嗎？那時我們早巳不知飄流到那裏去了！』</p>
<p>誰也不再說話。窗外，月光下睡着憂鬱的山谷。</p>
<p>外面，他們又鬧起來了，兩個女的笑着，男的高聲地嚷</p>
<p>『我的大女兒！我的小女兒！』</p>
<p>琪的夫人也忍不住笑起來，說：</p>
<p>「你們聽！怎樣的一位寶貝爸爸呀！」</p>
<p>笑聲才了，他們又唱起了悲壯的「別離歌」最後的兩句：</p>
<p>別了，別了，同學們！</p>
<p>我們再見在前綫！是很容易催人眼淚的。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，外面又靜得沒一點聲音，但當我們走過那間房子時，情形完全異樣：地掃得很乾凈，稻草地鋪也不見，他巳經走了。</p>
<h3>室中敎授飛行（下）</h3>
<p>— 沙鴻譯</p>
<p>平常要造就一個能單獨駕駛的人才，勢必要在空中經過八至十小時的訓練才行。假使用林克訓練器訓練，天空實習的時間可以减少一半，並且只需一小時在天空就擊了，－甚至還不需要一小時。喬治就是一九二八年由這種訓練器訓練出來的第一人，他在空中不過實習了四十二分鐘。</p>
<p>今日駕駛員需要能够藉無錢電的信號，在霧中辨識他們的途徑，還要能够穿過天花板圈而降陸。只賴無綫電光的輔助學習盲自飛行，要經過完全嚴格的操練。這種訓練器在道一點上最能證明其價値。通常一個駕駛員只要在空中飛過五十小時之後，就能進一步作盲目飛行的，現在只要在這種訓練器中訓練二十小時，再經過五小時的空中飛行就可以了。</p>
<p>完全為敎導盲目飛行用的訓練器，多裝一些附件，－一張導師用的桌子，以及和這架假機通訊的工具。從這學生降落地方的假設的航空站所發出的電話指導及無綫電方位的信號，都從這桌上發出。桌上放着裝了墨水的指示器，含自動地表示飛機進向。</p>
<p>機座中的駕駛員，一定要信賴機件及聽機。假定要飛到畢資堡去，他須將飛機昇到四千呎的高空，撥定他的飛行速度，而後平飛前進，耳中並須注意信號。他的無綫電航空圖却放在他的面前。</p>
<p>當他離開機座時，墨水指示器已將他的飛程圖描好了。道是可供暇時研究的紀錄，也是以後指導的根據。</p>
<p>林克能敏捷地使一個初學者變成器械的幹才，這種敏捷是於軍事上極有價値的。大不列顚因為在上决大戰中喪失了二百五十個訓練不足的駕駛員，使他購置了二百五十架林克訓練器，分佈帝國各處。德蘇意日也都採甩林克器來訓練駕駛員。張伯倫那决飛往德國貝許德斯迦登及慕尼黑所乘的飛機的駕駛員，和護送的德飛機的駕駛員，都是由林克訓練器訓練成功的。揚子江上的中日戰事中，和西班牙內戰中，雙方空戰的戰鬥員，也有不少用林克器訓練出來的。</p>
<p>林克已經成功了新世界所需求的人物，這是他千古不朽的貢獻。現在道種訓練器已經顯出些在軍事上的價値，預料將來空運發展，空中軍備擴張的時候，他偉大的功效更會逐漸透露出來。（譯自Readers　Digest）</p>
<h3>那裏能够追得上！</h3>
<h3>亂草一束</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>序曲</p>
<p>寂寞敎會了人思索，孤獨使人多想像。夜深沉，聽滴答的鐘聲，遂隨手記下這些零碎的感想。</p>
<p>時間</p>
<p>首先我想到了時間。多不易把捉的問題呵！（它從那裹而來，又往那裏而去呢？）一位唯美主義者說：「時間剝奪着你靑春的玫瑰。」又有人說：「別上什麽鐘錶店，聽你的靑春被蠶食。」於是，在時間的面前人們駭怕得發抖了。擔心紅顏變成白髮。</p>
<p>「一秒鐘有多少個可能呢？」誰知道？我並不期求一個神秘的答案，說什麼有隻冥冥之手牽着命運的網。朋友，細心點，你將驚異時間替人帶來的變化。太多太多了。</p>
<p>在我們記憶中的孩子，已懂得了愛情；活潑的人已走進墳墓了。您瞧瞧我們的祖國吧！他是如何的在與時間競賽中超過了它，而飛速地進步呢？</p>
<p>對了。這正是我所要競的。不要駭怕，更別發抖。抓住它，完成我們該幹的工作。</p>
<p>幸福</p>
<p>「幸福有時離人很近，甚至一伸手就可觸到，而人們還是喪失了它。」我久久不能忘記這句話。幸福常彷徨於原野，尋找不到顧主。</p>
<p>我叉常記起哄堂大笑中被捉弄者的尷尬面孔。人們慣於把自己的快樂建築在別人的痛苦上，說是得到了幸福。但可憐，答案是吾定的。</p>
<p>幸福不是自私的。而在這動亂的時代裏，早就沒有了個人的幸福，一切都依附於民族。舍本而逐末，爲一己努力是不會成功的。</p>
<p>幸福將落在祖國好兒女的身上。</p>

<h3>史太林看過我們的戲麽</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>—梅邊雜憶之四—</p>
<p>「史太林看過中國戲嗎？」這是我們（梅劇團團員）從蘇聯演戲回國，一直到今天，還遺留在腦海裹的一個疑問？</p>
<p>蘇聯！這新興而偉大的蘇聯！一書一行，委　太神秘了！要不是我們身歷其境，那們，對於「俄京旅話」（蔡運辰著）所謂：「禁網森羅，偵緝嚴密，」這八個字，是决不會發生信心的。</p>
<p>關於政治上的「涇淸渭濁」，恕我是懦夫，沒有這股勇氣，也沒有這種學識與資格，去任意雌黃。一向以「戲子」「伶工」自視的我，（我本來南通伶工學校的畢業生，又是梅浣華先生的矮足——高足的反比例——）吃一行且說一行。姑將我們游歷蘇聯，公演之餘，所得關於秘密警察的印象，以及史太林畢竟看過我們的表演沒有？這幾種富有「神秘趣味」的回憶，拉雜寫出來供給讀者。</p>
<p>當我們所乘蘇聯派來的專輪「北方號」，到達海參葳的時候，第一個觸進我們的眼簾的，便是那荷戈木立，穿着類似長袍外套的紅星鬥士。氣宇的軒昂！使我不自覺的於無形之中，也受着傳染，把我的駝胸曲背，立時也挺直起來。</p>
<p>稅吏的檢騐，是十分的和藹與隨便。這是我們特殊的優遇。（往年游日游美，也都是如此。還有一位法國的藝術家，自北平經滿洲里西比里亞回國，受着稅吏苛刻的留難，後來在他的行囊中，我出一張梅蘭芳送給他的像片，因而得立即放行。這位藝術家，在他的遊記中，深為感嘆「中國藝人」魔力之偉大！其文描寫盡致，刻晝入微，我會與徐君將他譯成中文，容當檢出，公諸讀者。）</p>
<p>蘇聯對於貴重物品的入境出境，限制是非常的嚴厲！還記得胡蝶女士，在登岸的時候，因為所携的鑽石寶飾太豐富眩耀了！使那些胼手胝足的粗大漢，不免驚奇而發生周折。可是後來竟得安然無事，仍舊携着她的「吸人的霓虹燈」。（這是我替一般女人飾品所取的別稱，）揚長登岸而去。這是什麼原故呢？原來這隻聰慧的「粉蝶兒」，在她出國之先，早巳料到這一層，在她那隻首飾匣子之中，雖然裝得滿滿的，却有十分之九都是「贗品。」</p>
<p>在且尼司金Chelnskin旅館的飯廳中，樂台上奏着那雄壯悲涼的「伏爾加船夫」曲，我們第一次嘗到「那「眞正羅松大菜」的風味。這家旅館的經理以至招待員，都能說很流利的山東話，允其是那位專門派來招待我們的一個招待員，一口純粹北平話，要不是看他面部的種族特徵，一定當他是位「京尤子」。（北平族人之善於辭令者，俗曰「京尤子。」）</p>
<p>星光燦爛·君，好萊塢的影星，多麽健美！</p>
<h3>譚鑫培第一次到上海</h3>
<p>— 老副末</p>
<p>譚鑫培到上海。在十舖九畝田時代。予已　申。靡得而詳矣。至若光宜之間。予方讀書海上。聞見所及。有可得而言者。爰筆而出之。以備愛談戲劇掌故者取資焉。</p>
<p>譚鑫增第一决到申。隸大新街桂仙茶園。似在光緒辛丑。即光緒二十一年也。桂仙為甬人應桂　所創。當譚伶未到申時。大小各報。嘗數傳其事。謂小呌天將來申演唱。小報中如李伯元之游戲報。李芋仙之寓言報。孫玉聲之笑林報等。嘗介紹其藝術。然未嘗言其搭班何園也。然以譚與丹桂茶園武生夏月潤有翁婿之誼。衆咸疑其必隸丹桂。維時上海戲園凡四家。曰天福。曰天仙。曰丹桂。桂仙則新創未久也。（天儀已閉）迨海報揭布。則隸桂仙。謂出衆料之外云。其實伶人憑包銀唱戲。與親誼固無關也。然亦可見當時顧曲者對於戲班子習俗見解之隔膜矣。譚伶是時署名小呌天。包銀月僅八百元。以視注桂芬之包銀已三倍之。同來者有一武生譚鈞培。第一日唱花蝴蝶即砸。自是不復登臺。後詢諸北來伶人。僉謂京師不知有是人。則該伶故弄玄虛。思一附驥尾而顯其名。亦未可知。譚伶第一日唱空城代斬　。座債正廳八角邊　亦貴至五角。故營業不盛。隸桂仙可半月。予所見之戲凡三齣。曰空城。曰洪羊洞。曰別母亂箭。時在桂子香飄之候也。越數年。復來一次。隸正豐街之丹桂。是時丹桂脚色。舍原有外。京伶有朱素雲孫怡雲等。然已約略不可復省矣。又予自癸已來申。所見京伶之老生。舍注種芬畏隸天福外。譚仱之來。確為第一决。（孫菊仙第一决來申。予未及見。第二决來申。較譚為後。）至前乎我所見者。則非予所知矣。然微於當時之所傳。以及海報之揭布。確為京都名角。初决到申也。</p>
<h3>蕩寇志女角　南珊凱蘭的成功</h3>
<p>— 陳潔</p>
<p>天才與修養溶合起來</p>
<p>要做」個電影明星，其實是一件很不容易的事情，不但要備有天才，而且更應十分好的修養呢。「蕩寇志」裏的女主角南姍凱蘭（NaenyKelly）演技的精湛和動人，我們且不談；現在我來介紹一段關於她自述的一段小史吧。她是應美國某電影雜誌編輯之請而作的。原文見Morie　Mirool國。</p>
<p>『我從不會忘記我媽媽和爸爸的。</p>
<p>我的媽媽敎我怎樣做戲，我的爸爸敎我怎樣跳舞。我的媽媽在結婚之前，已是紐的奧斯脫戲院的台柱劇員了。她現在不但敎我怎樣動作，而且敎我怎樣哭。她說一個演員是應當知道怎樣哭的。我便常常這樣做就練成一種能隨時隨地主動地哭的表情了。</p>
<p>在我四歲的時候，母親帶我到一個拍戲的劇塲去，這是屬於派拉蒙公司的；那時候在拍戲的正是葛羅莉史璜笙。這時正需要一個能善於表現哭感情的孩子，在塲的幾個臨時童角都做得不好，導演先生走近我們，問我媽。我媽說我會哭的，就呌我哭起來，我眞的哭起來，而且很帶眞呢。</p>
<p>此後，我就和李却狄克斯，琴赫旭，華納裴士德等配過戲。允其是華納，他是多麼良善，和氣，英勇啊，他常常帶我到花園中去動物園中去遊玩。他常常替我介紹給他的朋友說「這是未來的大明星呀！」</p>
<p>在起初，我是不上學校的，總在家裏聽着母親的敎誨，八歲的時候，我已經上舞台演劇了。媽媽又常常糾正我的發音，表情等。我常常獨個子，或是同媽一起在家裏演動作。後來，我又舉了法文，讀了許多法文劇本……</p>
<p>後來我上電台播音了，在紐的演戲的時候，竟被好萊塢某導演所發見而與之訂的。我就同爸爸媽媽一起住到好萊塢去。</p>
<p>我現在還只十八歲呢。然而，無論一絲一毫小的成就，我忘不了自己最親愛的爸爸和媽媽的』</p>
<p>我摘譯了這幾段，在這裏可以看出，一個演員的成功，決非是偶然的，的確要天才，修養溶合起來。並且隨時隨地要保持「向上性」，以求深造。在此，我寄這點希望於中國的女明星們！</p>
<h3>前進影人　藍蘋的歸宿</h3>
<p>— （慧存）</p>
<p>前進影人藍蘋，以前在戀愛的圈子裏，有過好幾决不平凡的演出。會記得在幾年前，杭州六和塔下的三對藝人集團結婚，藍蘋和唐納便是其中的一對，可是，不久之後，唐納是被遺棄了，藍蘋去跟着巳有了太太的章泥同居，然而，唐納為了藍蘋，又戀戀不捨，接運鬧了幾决自殺。</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生，唐納藍蘋以及章泯，這三位歡喜寃家，誰都有了新的覺悟，各奔前程，轉輾萬里，去幹簷神聖的抗戰工作了。</p>
<p>藍蘋在戰事發生後，先自拋別了同居過的章泯，前往內地，加入救亡演劇隊服務，及至去年夏季，她才和歐陽紅櫻一同到了延安，因為路途遙遠，交通梗阻，至今一年以夾，她的音訊也就隔膜了。</p>
<p>現在，筆者得自延安友人來信，據說藍蘋在「抗大」畢業後，現膺聘於魯迅藝術師範學院，担任敎職兼生活指導，更有喜訊相吿，藍蘋目前已有歸宿。就是在不久之前，她巳正式下嫁當地某名人，婚禮亦在從簡的原則下舉行過了。</p>
<h3>虞洽卿等發起　名仱名票　播音大會串</h3>
<p>— 獨氷</p>
<p>—為籌募時疫醫院經費—</p>
<p>別忘記那個日子——七月一日，七月二日·——上海各票友，各名伶聯合舉行籌募時疫醫院施藥費用的播昔大會串。地點是國華電台，時問每天下午二時起。天熱了。可是他們忙些什麼呢？</p>
<p>據那天發起人虞洽鄕的宣稱，時疫醫院每年施診施藥救活了千百萬貧病　苦的平民，可是，現在物價飛勝，藥費材料也隨着飛漲，假使事前沒有籌劃一筆的款，悠長的一個暑天裏，不將眼看活生生的平民們染疫死亡嗎？</p>
<p>金廷蓀，吳禮門，袁履登，竇耀庭等也發表了一些關懷貧病疾苦的意見，於是就决定請包小蝶等負責籌備票友方面的會串，而名伶方面的參加，則由伶界聯合會會長陳月樓主持。當然，需要吿訴讀者的是他們會串的陣容吧，但是，每個在滬的名伶是誰都熱心地願意為貧病者流幾粒汗，那麼，在新聞紙上，每個人的名字都是你旱所熟悉的了，而你們最喜愛的紅角兒也完全都將在空中和你見面。為了篇幅，是也不必把它們的姓名寫出來了。請別忘記那個日子——七月一日，七月二日。</p>
<h3>黎園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>紅豆館主文武崑亂無所不能</p>
<p>西園先生學識豐富，因自幼嗜劇成群，所以終身的精力，差不多一大半都用在研求戲劇上面。他今年六十多啦，然而精神仍甚健旺，腰腿上的工夫半點不會丟掉。數月前在某處還看到他隨便來一個「羣英會」小生的身段，身腰下灣作躬揖狀，一條腿還能伸得筆直，非常漂亮美觀。據說他會得到楞仙的眞傳，這一種架式若是使在台上，一對翎子，一起一落，再加上這個極邊式的身段，那眞是說不出的美呀。楞仙乃活　瑜徐小香的高足，小香歸隱後，楞仙會獲第一小生的崇銜，西園先生雖僅略試其技，巳足以表現公瑾的儒將風度。同時不佞還看過他同蘭芳合演的「奇雙會」那此一寫狀·三拉（趙　只一拉）以及闖院門的神　，和投袖。亮靴底·擺紗　翅·種種的工夫，我們更可知他學王的工力是很深邃的了。</p>
<p>他老先生除生行之外，復會從活孟德黃潤甫學過「戰宛城」的曹操，馬踏靑苗　馬的身段，在現今內行裏也沒對，俟喜瑞頗以此自負，但聽人說起他還是模仿的溥老。（也有人說是薄先生敎的）此外西園先生還掖演「風箏誤」的醜丫頭，他是否是大李七傳授的，那就非我所知了。總之溥先生的博學多才，生·凈·丑·末·無所不能。文·武·崑·亂·樣樣精到，乃又較陳·王·兩人略勝一籌了。况當遜淸末葉，他的地位身價非常尊崇，內行裏不論是何等名角，祇要他想從他們學習任何繁重的名劇，只要吩咐一聲，又有誰敢不把掏心窩子的能耐傳給他呢？因此像「全本寗武關」這一齣備極繁難的崑劇，現在內行中也惟有此公獨搜勝　了。叔岩·菊朋·德寶·三人雖均對是劇異常珍秘，但皆不逮溥氏遠甚，彼三人中恐尙有一二人係學自溥先生者，那當然不見得能靑出於藍了。（四八）</p>

<h3>楊月樓拐案續記</h3>
<p>楊月樓事，隔數日邑尊提案復訊。據章王氏供稱：「阿寳許配月樓，韋姓在滬之日，亦曾允許等語。」餘不細詰。當將箱子內三隻係韋王氏，給予收領，屬月樓者亦併覓保收領。韋王氏釋回，旋即憂鬰病故。月樓覊外監，阿寶禁官媒處。十三日復審，當傳家長韋某詰明，實無主婚許配楊月樓情事，阿寶因家長不願領回，再掌責發善堂擇配。楊月樓再予答賣後，邑尊科以誘拐之律，擬予軍遺，解郡過堂，經松郡太守提審，楊月樓磕頭聲寃，謂上海所供，「瞞阿寶父母，以誘拐其女等語。」係屈打成招。太守見而有憐憫日：「汝之被寃，吾知之矣！」楊月樓聞之，如脫桎梏而登袵席。深深磕頭曰：「小的復有生望矣！蒙大人秦鏡高懸，實罪民之生死而肉骨也！」但太守仍委婁縣復審，叉嚴打二百，責其不得翻供。於是楊月樓不敢復翻供詞，太守勘定，照例轉解至省。茲聞衛廉訪亦經提案問供，臬憲秉公，不肯加刑，楊月樓如先至松郡時，依舊翻供，矢口不移。　憲以犯人之呌屈，原屬常態，如果手足受刑，以致殘廢，或可以畏刑妄認，今旣無用刑傷損情形，豈容狡展。遂照例發回松郡復審，於是承認姦拐。昨日經州縣衙門，逐站由省遞回，已奉邑尊照原監禁，蓋已經按察堂上畫供，轉詳撫憲核明罪案，不日即可請咨發遣矣。噫！四千里塞外之風塵，雖楊月樓江湖浪蕩，辛苦備嘗，恐亦難消受！回首花天酒地，黛綠燈紅，不知作何懊恨也！</p>

<h3>Japanese Offend Wenzhou, Landing at Yuhuan; Kanmen Ablaze, War Ongoing; Chinese Troops Withdraw from Chao'an County, Fierce Fighting Northwest; Large Numbers of Fresh Troops Arrive at the Frontlines for Vigorous Counterattack; Strict Blockade of the Min River Estuary, Chen Yi Inspects Defenses</h3>
<p>Jinhua: This morning, over two hundred Japanese soldiers were added to the Sheyan Fort Hill area of Kanmen in Yuhuan. Yuhuan County Magistrate Qu Yin-zhi continues to lead his team in constant resistance. By 10:00 AM, the defenses were completely destroyed, and Kanmen was abandoned. After entering Kanmen, the Japanese troops immediately set it on fire. The blaze has not been extinguished by evening. The battle is still ongoing. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: Frontline telephone report: The invading Japanese troops in Chao'an launched a fierce attack on the suburbs of the city on the morning of the 27th, dividing into southeast routes. With no defenses to hold, Chinese troops withdrew from the county seat at 1:00 PM. They are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops northwest of the city. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese military news, today over two thousand Japanese troops, under the cover of naval artillery and aerial bombardment, landed on Yuhuan Island outside the port of Wenzhou. Chinese troops have built strong fortifications in the Kanmen area of the island, so the fighting there is exceptionally fierce. As for the Shantou area, the Chinese side admits that Caitang and Fuyang between Chaozhou and Shantou have been lost. The Japanese troops are now advancing northeast, approaching Chao'an, where there is often fierce fighting. (28th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, this office received a Chinese telegram confirming that Japanese troops landed simultaneously on the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces yesterday morning. It stated that these two landings are the initial step for large-scale operations in the future. Yesterday's actions were limited to attempting to seize the forward points of Fuzhou harbor and Yuhuan Island north of Wenzhou harbor. Chinese troops were not deployed in the forward point, so the area was occupied by Japanese troops yesterday. However, Chinese troops are resisting on Yuhuan Island, and the battle is currently ongoing. It has been found that the forward point is outside the water barriers built by Chinese troops at the port of Fuzhou. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports: Large numbers of Japanese warships and transport ships are now concentrated at the Minjiang and Oujiang estuaries. It is rumored that a large-scale landing will be carried out on the 29th. Military sources say that the Japanese decision to attack Chaoshan resulted in many casualties, and their forces are limited, so they seem unwilling to risk a deep incursion. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Fujian Chairman Chen Yi recently went to various coastal areas in eastern Fujian to inspect defenses. The Minjiang estuary has been strictly blockaded since the 29th, and all Chinese and foreign ships are prohibited from entering or leaving. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the vanguard of Japanese troops infiltrated the outskirts of Chaozhou yesterday morning, and the sound of artillery fire could be heard in the city. Residents have been fleeing to the upper reaches of the Han River since the night of June 26th. At the same time, Chinese reinforcements are now heading to Chaozhou, deploying defenses on the mountains west of the city to prevent the Japanese troops from penetrating deeper. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shantou: The Chengdong property of Butterfield &amp; Swire in this city was occupied by Japanese troops today. The British flag hanging above it was removed twice. Now it has been replaced with a Japanese flag. Japanese troops are now using the property as an unloading point for supplies. Japanese transport ships are moored beside it. At the same time, it is quite inconvenient for foreigners to land in Shantou from Queshi. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: A Central News Agency reporter traveled to a certain location on the 24th to meet with a certain commander. According to discussions on the Chaoshan battle situation, the Japanese side, due to dwindling troop resources and war-weary people, is attempting to divert public attention with new stimuli. The terrain of Chaoshan is flat and close to the sea, lacking military value. After gaining compensation, the Chinese side will naturally shift positions according to the tactics of the second phase of the war of resistance, continuing to engage with Japan. The commander also stated that the estimated Japanese troop strength in Chaoshan is two regiments, with the 10th Division as the main force, interspersed with some puppet troops and naval landing forces. Their fighting spirit is unusually sluggish, while the morale of the Chinese side is strong, and the people's hearts are stirred. If the Japanese penetrate deeper, they will inevitably suffer heavy losses. Furthermore, a certain adjutant recounted the circumstances of the withdrawal from Shantou, stating that on the 23rd, dozens of Japanese aircraft carried out repeated low-altitude bombing runs. The Chinese troops guarding Shantou city and the remaining few civilians stood firm and did not retreat. In the evening, the Japanese landed at the Chaoyang pier and Butterfield &amp; Swire pier, encountering ambushes by Chinese troops along the way, suffering many casualties. Chinese troops fought and retreated, making heroic sacrifices. Buildings in the city were set on fire, and Shantou city has almost become a ruin. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese troops have increased their forces in Shantou to over two thousand, using mechanized units to attack Anbu and Meixi along the railway. Fierce fighting occurred for two days, with heavy casualties on both sides. Over a thousand Japanese reinforcements continued to arrive. Chinese troops are holding the Caitang and Huamei stations, confronting the Japanese. A certain Chinese force has arrived in Jieyang and is rushing to the front lines to annihilate the enemy. The attack on Chaoshan is being carried out by the 104th Division of Guangzhou, with six thousand men. After occupying Shantou, they launched a rapid attack on Chao'an along the Chaoshan Railway and the Han River. By the afternoon of the 27th, Chinese troops, due to heavy casualties, reluctantly withdrew, awaiting reinforcements for a counterattack. (28th Afternoon Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinhua: More than half of the Japanese troops who landed in Kanmen, Yuhuan on the morning of the 26th were annihilated by Chinese troops. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to their ships. On the morning of the 27th, six more Japanese warships and a dozen speedboats arrived near Kanmen, cruising back and forth. Two Japanese aircraft also circled overhead, seemingly intending to land again. The Chinese side is on strict alert. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Four Japanese warships sailed to the Hai'er Sea of Fuqing, more than a hundred miles south of the Minjiang estuary, yesterday afternoon. Several speedboats carried two to three hundred Japanese soldiers, who attacked the Qingfeng Township area of Dongyang Island, which belongs to Pingtan County. Fierce fighting broke out with Chinese self-defense forces. Japanese warships fired artillery bombardments, and multiple Japanese aircraft also assisted in the battle. The artillery fire was intense. The Pingtan County Magistrate is supervising the self-defense forces and continues to fight hard. Pingtan is also an island, and its position is similar to Yuhuan Island east of the Oujiang estuary. Dongyang Island is east of Pingtan Island, divided into the two islands of Daxiang and Xiaoxiang. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Tianjin Incident; British and Japanese to Hold Negotiations Soon; Japanese Side Puts Forward Four More Demands; British Side States Only Local Issues Will Be Discussed; Consuls from Both Countries Stationed in Tianjin Go to Tokyo to Participate in Talks and Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain today answered questions in the House of Commons regarding the situation in Tianjin, saying that British and Japanese authorities will meet in Tokyo to discuss the Tianjin case. The British government's intention is that actions such as strip searches should cease. This is the actual situation. The Prime Minister answered six questions on the order paper, saying that first the local situation will be discussed, and the delivery of fresh and perishable foods remains intermittent, with only a small portion of the usual supply reaching the British concession. British authorities are making every effort to remedy the current shortage. Since the start of the blockade, British citizens passing through the obstacles have been subjected to strict searches, but this has not been seen in the past day or two. British Ambassador to Tokyo Sir Robert Craigie has been in contact with the Japanese government for some time regarding the Tianjin case. Now I am able to announce that the British and Japanese governments, after exchanging views, have agreed to hold mutual discussions in Tokyo in order to resolve various issues concerning the Tianjin situation. These talks are about to begin and will focus on local disputes, aiming to ensure the maintenance of neutrality in the concession while preserving the British authority in the concession intact. Representatives from the British and Japanese authorities in Tianjin will now be invited to Tokyo to carry out this matter. The British government, in view of these talks, dares to expect that actions such as strip searches in Tianjin should cease. This is the actual situation. The British government, in this situation, believes there is no need to submit this case to the League of Nations Administrative Council for adjudication. A member asked whether the Tokyo talks would be limited to local disputes or would include the broader demands put forward by the Japanese spokesman in Tianjin. The Prime Minister replied that the talks concerned local disputes. Conservative MP Major General Knox asked whether, while the Tokyo talks have not achieved results, the Prime Minister will firmly insist that all interference with British citizens in Tianjin should absolutely cease, and will declare that we are a great power, so the patience we have maintained in the past two weeks is greater than that held by any great power in history. The Prime Minister did not answer this. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared in the House of Lords today that he has protested to Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu in the strongest terms regarding the strip searches of defenseless British citizens in Tianjin, and said that negotiations will begin in Tokyo soon in order to resolve the situation in Tianjin. Former President of the British Empire Chamber of Commerce Lord Elibank said that no diplomatic language used by the Foreign Secretary could be more forceful to make the Japanese government realize that Britain and its empire have been outraged by the unbearable insults inflicted on its nationals by the Japanese side, the improper coercive actions taken against trade interests by the Japanese side, and the Japanese government's lack of intention to curb this behavior. Labor Lord Snell continued to speak, saying that in the talks held in Tokyo, the recent Japanese bombing of China, which resulted in the death of a Canadian missionary couple, will be investigated. The Foreign Secretary replied that this matter certainly cannot be ignored. The Foreign Secretary also told Lord Elibank that the future talks in Tokyo will concern local events, and that he fully feels the strength of the natural and legitimate emotions that the Tianjin dispute has stirred up in the British people.

<p>(Tianjin) According to an announcement by the British Consulate General today, British Consul Major Herbert will depart from Tanggu at 5:00 AM tomorrow aboard the British warship HMS Tadworth to go to Tokyo and participate in the British-Japanese Tianjin Incident negotiations to be held there. It is also heard that Tianjin Japanese Consul Tagami will also depart for home tomorrow to report on the Tianjin situation. The general situation in Tianjin has eased somewhat today. No untoward incidents have been reported at the entrances and exits of the concession. Because the tense situation here has shown signs of easing, the attention of the general public has shifted to the Tokyo aspect. There is much worry and speculation about the outcome of the future negotiations and their impact on British interests in North China. Yesterday afternoon, a British tugboat carrying several Chinese and foreign passengers was detained at the Dalian pier inspection point for as long as seven hours. It was not released until after repeated negotiations between the British side and the Japanese consular authorities, arriving at the Bund of the British concession at 11:00 PM in the evening. Upon arrival, it was again blocked by a Japanese military patrol boat, but there were no further actions. Tianjin US Marine Corps Commander Lieutenant Colonel Hawthorne visited Tianjin Japanese Garrison Commander Honma this morning. The Japanese commander visited in return in the afternoon. Regarding general shipping conditions, there are no unexpected reports today. Only the Japanese do not allow rickshaws to enter the property of a certain British shipping company in Tanggu, forcing general travelers to walk half a mile before being able to hire a car.

<p>British Newspapers Suspect Tokyo Talks</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers have welcomed Japan's agreement to begin Tianjin negotiations with Britain in Tokyo with cautious language, but their words contain a strong sense of doubt. The News Chronicle published an article by the famous reporter Mr. Bartlett, saying that he had heard authoritative warnings from faraway countries such as the United States, India, and New Zealand, that if a "appeasement" policy were to reappear in the Far East, it would be enough to bring about harmful effects, but now he dares not immediately guarantee that the government has not planned appeasement. The Japanese side has not publicly apologized for the atrocities committed against British citizens in Tianjin, causing countries in the Far East to have the mistaken impression that Britain has submitted itself to Japan's hegemony in China. The Manchester Guardian said that the Japanese side will test how far it can push Britain in other areas such as the currency of North China. It is hoped that the British government will not return to a policy of appeasement, which can only obtain temporary comfort and is not a permanent solution. The Daily Mail said that today's question is what kind of cooperation the Japanese side will express. If the Japanese side puts forward demands to undermine the autonomy of the concession, urging that the residents of the concession be handed over to a puppet who is in fact controlled by Japanese warlords, then accepting the demands is out of the question. As for the economic aspect, if the Japanese side demands recognition of the United Reserve Bank of China notes and the handover of 50 million yuan of the National Government's cash currently in the British concession, these are all out of the question. The Daily Telegraph said that Japanese Army General Honma gently mentioned that the "traffic restrictions" cited during the Tianjin blockade are still the main point of contention in Japanese policy. The implementation of these traffic restrictions is to retaliate against the Western powers. Now it seems to have reached the point of putting the possibility of restricting the economic traffic of British citizens at the forefront of any negotiations. The Times published a letter from Mr. Phillips, who earnestly stated that a large number of Oriental communities under British rule in Hong Kong, Malaysia, North Borneo, and other parts of the Far East, if the British government continues to fail to protect the people of the British concession in Tianjin and allows them to be insulted by the Japanese, the impact on the aforementioned communities will be unimaginable. When the House of Lords met today, MP Lord Elibank asked a question, earnestly stating the danger of the Tianjin situation being unable to break the siege, and asking the government to pay attention to what consequences would occur if the Japanese were to inflict unbearable insults on British citizens again.

<p>Tokyo Newspapers Threaten Britain</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the newspapers here are paying attention to Britain's attitude towards the Tianjin incident. Chugai Commercial News stated that the British concession in Tianjin is nothing less than a "microcosm" of Britain's pro-Chiang policy. It is well known that Britain is eager to protect its interests in China, but if Britain fails to pay due attention to the "reality" of North China, it may lose all of its interests in North China. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the British side will not be able to resolve the Tianjin dispute simply by handing over the murderer of Cheng Xigeng, or have any benefit in adjusting the increasingly hostile situation between Britain and Japan. The newspaper also stated that the force of circumstances has forced Britain to revise its pro-Chiang anti-Japanese policy. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan Blocks All of China's Seas</h3>
<p>In the recent war against China, after suffering major defeats in Jinxi and Northern Hubei, Japan's clay feet are sinking deeper and deeper, into an utterly helpless situation. Yet suddenly, it is attempting to expand its battlefield: openly taking a challenging attitude towards Britain in North China, using violence to blockade the British concession, and wantonly insulting British military personnel and civilians, almost without resorting to anything; in the Northeast, the war with the Soviet Union is also openly igniting. Judging from the number of enemy planes shot down claimed in the war reports of both sides, the severity of the situation is actually no less than the rekindling of the Zhanggufeng Incident; in China, Japan is tightening its coastal blockade and dispatching troops to land everywhere on various seaports and islands. A few days ago, it had just seized Shantou, and recently it successively occupied places such as the Zhoushan Islands. Yesterday, it occupied Hutou Island and Kanmen Port on Yuhuan Island along the coast of Wenzhou, as well as Chuanshi Island outside the Minjiang estuary. Looking at it this way, almost all of the few remaining seaports along the coasts of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong in China have been blockaded and occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Japanese naval and military personnel, these successive demonstrations and victorious occupations (?) are truly war achievements worthy of exaggeration and boasting! People in the international community who do not understand the inside story may be shocked for a moment, thinking that Japan still has the ability to do something and still has so-called prestige; and the Japanese people who are trapped in the news control network may have their views and hearings shifted for a moment, and thus become more excited; even those who want to compromise with Japan may therefore be more likely to soften and surrender. But how much does this ultimately harm China's strength to resist Japan?</p>
<p>Are we talking about blockading the source of China's military supplies? Because of the difficult inland transportation, these seaports have never been used as routes for military supplies to enter. The current blockade naturally does not hinder China's source of military needs. Are we talking about destroying China's main military forces? The site of the decisive battle between China and Japan is already not on the coast but in the interior; and since internal transportation in these ports is difficult, the Japanese army's occupation of these places is no different from the previous occupation of places such as Xiamen and Qiongzhou, merely wasting military strength and without any war results. The result is only to provide China with materials for the "war of attrition." As for hindering China's commercial traffic and the general coastal economy, there may be some truth to it; but we must understand that China's current economic activities have actually developed as much as possible towards the southwest, which is the base of resistance against Japan. China is planning to isolate the prosperity of the controlled economic forces in the occupied areas, in order to avoid the suspicion of providing resources to the enemy; even if coastal traffic is cut off, this is also a manifestation of the spirit of a brave man cutting off his wrist when stung by a poisonous snake, so what is there to worry about! Moreover, coastal blockades can at least limit the convenience of leaks and circulation for some nominal domestic goods and high-priced foreign goods, which is not without benefit to the war of resistance economy.</p>
<p>Therefore, from China's perspective, the actual damage from the Japanese army's blockade and occupation of coastal seaports is actually very small; the central issue is that Japan's destruction of the interests of European and American countries in China has become more prominent and has fallen into an unrecoverable situation. We know that the only remaining interests of European and American countries in China are the so-called shipping industry; however, the Yangtze River is not allowed to be navigable, and various restrictions are imposed on the Pearl River and Qingdao, so the degree of damage they have suffered is considerable; now, several important ports along the coast, such as Shantou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou, have been completely blockaded by the Japanese army, so what coastal shipping industry can European and American countries talk about in the future? Therefore, Japan's blockade of the Chinese coast is in effect no different from thoroughly driving out European and American businesses in China, which is obvious.</p>
<p>Now that Britain and the United States still want to talk to Japan about legal principles, it has already given you a de facto disregard. The pitiful isolationists in the United States still think that the fire has not yet burned their eyebrows; and the pitiful Mr. Chamberlain, in the anti-British movement in Tianjin, has already admitted to suffering great "unbearable insults," but still does not give up hope of compromising on the spot; now Japan has also abruptly blockaded all of China's coastal British shipping, in order to maintain its position in China, I wonder how Britain will try to obtain a compromise? The British Navy seems to be still obsessed with legal principles, thinking that the Sino-Japanese war is an undeclared war, and that ships of third countries should have the freedom to enter and exit occupied ports, hoping to obtain Japan's permission for this reason. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side openly acknowledged that the undeclared war is a common occurrence in ordinary wars, and openly acknowledged it as a "wartime blockade." We know that a wartime blockade is entirely a wartime act after a declaration of war. How can Japan wage war against China without a declaration of war, and use the name of a blockade to hinder the entry and exit of ships of other countries? Isn't this a blatant violation of the principles of maritime freedom and neutral commerce in international law? Isn't this intentionally mocking the UK for being powerless?</p>
<p>I remember when Japan first announced the blockade of the Chinese coast, it also declared that it would respect the trade of third countries; later, it repeatedly harmed the trading interests of the UK and the US, and the UK and the US remained silent and did not take any action in practice. Now Japan is intensifying its efforts to implement a thorough blockade of the entire coast. This intimidating arrogance is merely a threat to the UK and the US. If the UK and the US are truly willing to abandon their commercial interests in China and completely withdraw their Far East national defenses, then so be it; at this moment, we really no longer need arguments about legal principles, but only a manifestation of action. This decisive matter may be the last touchstone!</p>
<h3>Japan Forbids Foreign Ships to Stay in Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Britain and the United States Ignore It. Japan Must Bear Any Damages. British Warship Carries Passengers and Mail into Shantou Port.</h3>
<p>(Washington) An official of the State Department stated today that the United States would ignore the Japanese warning to foreign ships and foreigners to leave Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Japan must be responsible for any damage suffered by American ships. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently spoke in the House of Commons about the situation in South China, saying, "The Japanese authorities have announced their intention to take military action against the two ports of Wenzhou and Fuzhou in China on the 27th of this month. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, made a request to the British Consul-General, Phillips, stating that merchant ships and warships of all countries should leave these ports before noon on the 29th of this month. The British Consul-General immediately rejected this request, saying that the right of British ships to navigate to various ports in China should not be infringed upon. Regarding this matter, the British government believes that the Japanese authorities have no right to unduly interfere with the movements of British ships and the lives and property of British citizens." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British ships Sistan and Guangdong have been waiting outside Shantou all day, unable to enter the port. The situation is unclear. However, it is understood that the British destroyer Sunart (905 tons) has already carried the passengers and mail of the Sistan into the port. What is currently known for sure is that the two merchant ships are still anchored outside Shantou. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) British ships and other foreign ships in Wenzhou and Fuzhou had Japanese planes flying over them yesterday afternoon, dropping canisters containing notices requesting all ships to leave the port immediately. Norwegian and Italian ships docked in Wenzhou complied with this request, but the two British warships and the British ships Hai Qing and Xinjiang in Fuzhou ignored the warnings and remained in port. At the same time, the Japanese side announced that it had occupied key points outside the Oujiang River estuary in Wenzhou this morning at 10 a.m. and occupied several islands at the Minjiang River estuary, thus blockading Fuzhou and Wenzhou. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Eight Japanese warships gathered off the coast of the Minjiang River estuary. Six of them left at 11 a.m. this morning, and eight more arrived at 4 p.m. in the afternoon, including an aircraft carrier carrying 21 Japanese aircraft. Four Japanese warships also arrived off the coast of Fuqing south of the Minjiang River estuary. There are now a total of fourteen Japanese warships and many Japanese boats. Japanese aircraft have been taking off alternately over the past two days, attacking the Minjiang River and the coastal area, dropping hundreds of bombs in places such as Changmen, Meihua, Wulongjiang, Diezhou Township, Hongshan Bridge, and Baisha Township. Various places are under air raid day and night. (Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Japanese notification requesting ships of third countries to leave Fuzhou and Wenzhou, a State Department official said today that the American Consul in Shanghai, Gauss, had rejected it, on the grounds that American citizens have the right to reside in and travel to the treaty ports (i.e., commercial ports) in China. If the Japanese cause any damage to the lives and property of American citizens, the United States government will hold Japan accountable. It is reported that the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Yarnell, also gave the same response, saying that the United States has the freedom of navigation in the waters off China. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the Japanese side has decided to occupy the two ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou in China, and has requested that all ships and residents of various countries withdraw from these ports. The State Department has received reports of this matter. It has been found that the Japanese side has made such requests before taking military action in various parts of China. As for the claim that withdrawal is required before noon on the 29th of this month, the State Department has not received an official report. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British ships Xin Haimen and Guangdong, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shantou on the morning of the 27th, arrived in Shantou on the morning of the 28th and were prevented from entering the port by the Japanese army. After negotiations by the British Consul and the captain of the British warship Dannat with the Japanese Consul, it was ineffective. It is reported that the British naval authorities have decided to send warships to escort the two ships into the port on the afternoon of the 28th. (Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the emergency in Fuzhou and Wenzhou, Zhongjiao and other banks suspended remittances to these two places starting on the morning of the 28th. Telegrams are still working. Britain has decided to ignore the Japanese military's announcement limiting ships to leaving Fuzhou and Wenzhou. After Noel returns to Hong Kong from Singapore on the 30th, he will personally handle the Japanese military's unreasonable blockade of Chinese commercial ports. In other news, Britain will equip larger ships sailing in the Far East with two cannons for armed self-defense. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese Consul-General in Shantou, Matsudaira, has rejected Britain's request to allow foreign ships to enter Shantou Port. It is reported that Matsudaira replied to the British Consul-General, Mr. Li, that foreign ships cannot be allowed to enter Shantou Port in order to maintain peaceful order. Matsudaira also asked Mr. Li to pay attention to the unfriendly attitude taken by the British authorities towards Japanese military operations in South China. It is reported that the British naval authorities have decided that if the Japanese side does indeed attempt to prevent foreign ships from sailing into Shantou Port, they intend to send warships to protect foreign ships heading to Shantou. The ships Guangdong and another British ship are currently anchored outside Shantou Port. The British naval authorities are now planning to escort the two ships into port today. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British Consul in Shantou, Mr. Li, along with the commander of the British destroyer, visited the Japanese Consul-General in Shantou yesterday afternoon. Mr. Li requested that the Japanese authorities recognize the principle that foreign ships have the right to freely enter and leave Shantou Port. His reasoning was that since China and Japan have not declared war, third countries do not need to comply with the obligations of neutral countries. The Japanese Consul-General replied that British ships were attempting to disrupt Japanese military operations (referring to hindering the Japanese army's landing in Shantou), and that Britain was taking an unfriendly attitude towards Japanese military operations in South China. Now that the waters off Shantou are under the control of the Japanese army, in order to maintain order, the passage of foreign ships is temporarily prohibited. However, for the convenience of foreign residents, one British ship per week will be allowed to enter the port to transport food and mail. This is a special accommodation.

<h3>Churchill Observes: A European Crisis Lurks. The Next Three Months Will Be the Most Tense Period. Japanese Provocative Actions Show Tacit Understanding with Germany.</h3>
<p>(London) Churchill said in a speech in London today that July, August, and September must be regarded as the most tense period in the European situation. He attaches great importance to the position in which he finds himself today, which is very similar to what was discovered last year. The only important difference is that there is no room for retreat this year. He does not believe that war is inevitable, but if one examines Germany's preparations, the tone of the newspapers under the German government's control, and the speeches of the Nazi leaders, it is impossible to argue that the worst-case scenario will not occur or will not occur immediately. He wishes to advise Hitler that before rashly plunging into a terrible war with unknown consequences, he should consider whether his lifelong task of liberating Germany will be reduced to nothing. Britain has now reached the point of no return, and Hitler should be aware of this. He also agreed with the French Prime Minister Daladier's statement that the forces of aggression have gathered. He now knows that British defense forces, especially the air force, are mostly in a state of active alert. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Churchill also praised the government's calm attitude in confronting Japan, believing that the Japanese provocative actions in the Far East were in tacit agreement with the German side, in order to lure the main force of the British fleet to the Far East, and then Germany would launch in Europe. Fortunately, the government dealt with it calmly, and the conspiracy did not succeed. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Firmly States: Maintain Peace with Armed Force. The Moment of Critical Importance Is Approaching on the Eve of a Great War. Encourage the Entire Nation to Unite and Face the National Crisis Together.</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies announced its adjournment today. Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier attended and delivered an important speech, stating that the seriousness of the international situation today is unprecedented in the past twenty years. "They are concentrated outside our borders, with nearly three million soldiers, not counting members of paramilitary organizations and factory workers. Moreover, in recent times, even larger numbers of troops have been concentrated. The primary duty of our government is to strengthen national defense. The government spares no expense, using hundreds of billions for national defense, and the reason for this is that we are prepared to cooperate sincerely with all nations to consolidate peace, but we are also determined to confront any attempt to control the world by force with all our strength." (All deputies cheered unanimously.) Prime Minister Daladier finally said that the Chamber of Deputies can be convened at any time if necessary during the adjournment. In addition, the Prime Minister also delivered a speech in the Senate, stating, "Today, the most important tasks we bear are threefold: first, to expand military preparations; second, to unite the whole country; and third, to closely monitor the development of the situation. Indeed, if France is not strong or united, there is no hope of preserving freedom. We are determined to maintain peace in Europe and will resolutely oppose any attempt to undermine peace."

<h3>Britain Issues New Instructions. The Three Countries Reopen Negotiations. All Demands Proposed by the Soviet Union. Britain Can Accept in Principle.</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuter's diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government last night issued new instructions regarding the negotiations for the Anglo-French-Soviet anti-aggression pact to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union and Special Envoy of the Foreign Office Strang. It is expected that after these instructions arrive, the British representatives and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will hold further meetings within this week. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to absolutely reliable sources here last night, the British government authorities are about to accept all the demands of the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time and jointly sign a military alliance treaty with France and the Soviet Union. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has instructed Foreign Office Envoy Strang to accept the conditions proposed by the Soviet side and conclude a military alliance treaty on the spot in Moscow as soon as possible. According to the British attitude, if it fails to achieve results, and the Soviet government strictly adheres to neutrality as a threat to Britain, the British side sent new instructions to Strang last night. It is learned that Strang has requested the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to receive him on Thursday, at which time the Soviet conditions can be implemented and accepted by the British representative. It is heard that he will have the right to give a nominal guarantee to the security of the Baltic countries. Also, according to the Soviet Union's claim, the provisions on mutual assistance should take effect immediately, so that the Soviet authorities can implement preliminary actions when Poland, Romania, or the Baltic countries are threatened by aggression. This has already been prepared for acceptance by the British side. In addition, the British government has also expressed its agreement to the holding of staff meetings by the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, and to the plan for cooperation between the naval, land, and air forces. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, diplomatic figures recently stated that the government's new instructions will be telegraphed to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union tonight, so that he can continue negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov based on the following two principles: (1) The United Kingdom should promise to give automatic and indirect guarantees to the "neutral countries," namely Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, in principle. (2) The names of the three countries can be clearly stated. The reason why these instructions must be sent at night is to carefully consider the wording so that the Soviet government can accept it in principle without any further objections. Moreover, the outline of the instructions was already discussed and finalized by the United Kingdom and France last week. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Watches</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The progress of the negotiations for the mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union has attracted much attention from political and journalistic circles here. The Politische Auslands-Korrespondenz fiercely attacked the attempt to force a guarantee on the Baltic coastal countries, saying, "This method aims to achieve its own goals and does not hesitate to sacrifice the sovereignty of third countries. This is common in international affairs. Those Baltic coastal countries believe that it is appropriate to remain neutral in war, but other countries are trying to control their destiny. The military ambitions have already been revealed. In short, the British government, in order to avoid accepting new constraints in the Far East, does not hesitate to make major concessions to the Soviet Union in Europe. This is especially evident."

It is found that the first secretary, army attaché, and naval attaché in the Soviet Embassy have all been ordered to be recalled, but have not yet returned to their posts. The positions have been vacant for a long time. It is not known who will be responsible for diplomatic affairs after Mr. Smithanin leaves Japan. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to sources here, German industrialists held a meeting at the end of last week, advocating the dispatch of a military-commercial delegation to the Soviet Union to discuss trade issues between Germany and the Soviet Union. As for the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Berger, after returning home this time and discussing matters with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has now returned to the Soviet Union to continue his duties. He will return home for instructions within six weeks. It is intriguing what negotiations will be conducted with the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Wellington Koo Speaks in England: Importance of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Powers Cannot Stand Idly By as Japan Destroys It.</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to France, Dr. Wellington Koo, recently gave a speech at the Billington Building here, entitled "The Open Door Policy and World Peace." He first described the origin of the Open Door Policy and elaborated on the importance of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, stating that the signatory countries of the treaty, except for China, all declared that they would respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. In China, it was promised to maintain the Open Door Policy. All these principles have greatly benefited the prosperity of China and other signatory countries. However, since the September 18 Incident in Shenyang on September 18, 1931, Japan has been trying to exclude the interests of other countries from China. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the trade figures of various countries in the occupied areas of China have been constantly declining, while Japan's trade with China, which accounted for only 6.5% of the total trade of various countries with China in 1936, increased to 38.5% in 1938, which can be seen.

<p>, when he vehemently condemned Britain's weak attitude toward the Tianjin incident, he received unanimous support. As for another group of people, they advocated that American foreign policy should be governed by international law. According to the opinion of Republican isolationist Senator Fess, the Bloom Act would make the United States join hands with Britain and France, so it cannot be considered a neutrality law.

<h3>The Blum Bill: Six Key Points</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Blum Neutrality Act Amendment proposed by Chairman Blum of the House Foreign Affairs Committee has six key points:</p>
<p>(1.   After the outbreak of war, to ensure the safety of the United States, or to maintain peace for the United States, or to protect the lives of American citizens, the President may, if necessary, designate the countries at war as belligerents.</p>
<p>2.   Once a belligerent country is designated, American citizens may not travel on ships of that country.</p>
<p>3.   Once a belligerent country is designated, it shall not be granted credit or loans, nor shall securities be bought or sold to it. Only short-term commercial credit may be granted, and the details shall be announced by the President every three months. Violators of the above prohibitions shall be subject to imprisonment and a fine of up to $50,000.</p>
<p>4.   All goods shipped to belligerent countries shall have their ownership transferred before export. According to this provision, the shipment of American arms to belligerent countries is not prohibited.</p>
<p>5.   Donations of funds or goods from American citizens to belligerent countries based on humanitarian grounds shall be announced by the President.</p>
<p>6.   The provisions of this law shall not apply to Latin American countries in the event of war.</p>
<p>In addition, the current procedures for obtaining export licenses for arms will be maintained. It is reported that the most intense attacks from the opposition were on the following two points: first, that the President could designate war zones and prohibit American ships and people from entering them; second, that the terms of commercial credit granted to belligerent countries could be determined by the President's full authority. In order to make the Blum Amendment easier to pass, the leaders of the House government faction have decided to eliminate these two points. Regarding the second point, most members of Congress may accept it, but with a limit of ninety days, according to a Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Vigorously Argues to Congress to Maintain Currency Control Power, Saying That the Abolition of This Power Will Affect National Defense, Silver Prices Plunge, Mexico Suspends Foreign Exchange Transactions</h3>
<p>Hyde Park, New York. After the Senate passed an amendment yesterday to abolish the President's power to change the fineness of the dollar, President Roosevelt met with reporters here and made a statement, saying: "If this power is abolished, our national defense will inevitably be affected. If a country's foreign trade is affected, its national strength will inevitably weaken. However, the Senate's vote is not the final decision on this issue and still requires a joint committee of the House and Senate to discuss it. In short, my term for this power expires at midnight on the 30th of this month. If it cannot be extended before the expiration date, then currency control will revert to Wall Street, which will be enough to prompt speculators and international bankers to manipulate the price of the dollar for their own private interests, as they did before 1933. The impact of this will be the arrival of a period of international monetary chaos again. The economies of the United States and other countries will be adversely affected and it is appropriate to find ways to avoid this." This statement has been explained by government officials, saying that the President is determined not to let Congress deprive him of his power and will respond strongly with all his strength. At this moment, a compromise solution can still be sought, but if the opposition insists on a "negative" attitude, then President Roosevelt will make Congress understand where its responsibilities lie. In view of the President's statement that national defense will be affected, it is known that the President's main focus is still on the international situation. Regarding this, people close to the President said that if the President's power is limited, all totalitarian states will believe that American foreign policy has been constrained and the chances of European conflicts will increase, which President Roosevelt is eager to avoid. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Will Not Change</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate yesterday passed the Townsend Amendment, deciding to stop buying silver abroad. Semi-official sources have commented that this does not mean that the United States is changing its current foreign policy. The Townsend Amendment was rejected mainly from the perspective of domestic politics, so there is not much to worry about. On the contrary, what the government authorities feel anxious about is the Senate's refusal to grant President Roosevelt two other powers: first, the power to change the gold content of the dollar, and second, the power to regulate domestic silver prices. The government must do its best to maintain these, especially the power to purchase silver from abroad. After the United States stops purchasing silver from abroad, the most directly affected will be Mexico. Members of Congress have long been dissatisfied with the Mexican government's confiscation of American merchants' oil mines and its failure to meet the demands of the American companies involved. No one defends Mexico. Moreover, after hearing about the passage of the Townsend Amendment, the Mexican government immediately asked the United States to provide assurances regarding the continued purchase of silver from abroad, in order to compare it with the government's persistent attitude in the oil mine confiscation case. There is a great difference between their current obsequiousness and their previous arrogance. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)</p>
<p>Not Much Impact on China</p>
<p>Washington. According to experts from the Treasury Department, they have no intention of manipulating the domestic economy by using presidential privileges. Their only intention is to protect American currency from being affected by foreign currency devaluations. If the bill to abolish the silver purchase law is passed by the House of Representatives, then China may not be affected, because the amount of silver that China can sell is already very small. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)</p>
<p>Senators Unanimous</p>
<p>(Washington) There is currently a feeling in the US Congress that if President Roosevelt wants to maintain the equalization fund, he must accept the termination of his dollar devaluation powers and higher silver prices. Currently, a group of forty-eight senators is united. If the House does not agree with the Senate's amendment yesterday and returns the original bill to the Senate, then they will do everything possible to prevent the passage of the entire currency bill. It is reported that the Senate approved the government's $2 billion equalization fund yesterday and passed the following amendments: (1) Allowing the Treasury Department to have a 40% seigniorage tax when buying domestic silver and increasing the price of newly mined domestic silver to 77.4 cents per ounce; (2) Stopping the Treasury Department's power to buy silver from abroad; (3) All of the President's powers to reduce currency values will terminate on June 30th. (Reuter's dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Treasury Reduces Silver Prices</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Treasury Department today reduced the price of buying foreign silver in New York from 43 cents per ounce to 40 cents. Officials have not yet announced the reason for lowering the foreign silver purchase price, but some say that the difference between the London and New York market prices is widening. If the purchase price does not change, then the quantity of deliveries to the US Treasury Department will be huge, so the US Treasury Department has to take this action. According to the official price of large silver from Handy &amp; Harman in New York, it has been reduced from 42.75 cents per ounce to 39.75 cents. (Reuter's dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States currently sets the price for buying silver from abroad at 43 cents in US currency per ounce. The Treasury Department has decided to reduce it to 40 cents per ounce, effective from noon today (local time) for a period of 24 hours. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Silver merchants here are generally pessimistic due to the US Treasury Department's large cuts in foreign silver prices and expect silver prices to continue to fall. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)</p>
<p>Government Can Still Buy Gold</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's currency powers will expire on the 30th of this month. The government has submitted a bill requesting a two-year extension. The Senate yesterday passed an amendment to "abolish the President's power to change the fineness of the dollar." This matter has been commented on by experts from the Treasury Department, saying that even if the House of Representatives follows the Senate in abolishing the President's special privilege, the President can still find ways to change the value of the dollar when necessary, because the President still has the power to order the Treasury Department to buy gold, and its terms and methods are not subject to any restrictions. As long as the purchase of gold continues, the price of gold can be increased, and the value of the dollar will be lowered accordingly. Previously, in 1933, President Roosevelt raised the price of gold from $20.67 per ounce to $35, which is a previous example. (Reuter's dispatch from Havana on the 27th)</p>
<p>Mexico Suspends Foreign Exchange Transactions</p>
<p>Mexico. Banks in Mexico yesterday suspended foreign exchange transactions. It is reported that this move is the result of the US Senate's passage of the bill to abolish the silver purchase law. Also, the black market price of the dollar here is 5.25 pesos (Mexican silver dollars), a decrease of 0.75 pesos compared to the past. According to the announcement by the Bank of Mexico, the supply of foreign exchange will be temporarily suspended until the United States continues to purchase foreign silver. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)</p>
<p>Mexico. The Silver Mining Association here claimed today that if the US Treasury Department decides to stop buying silver, it will be a fatal blow to the Mexican silver mining industry. It is reported that the total investment in Mexico's silver mining industry amounts to 1,000,000,000 US dollars, mostly American capital. (Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 28th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Window to the West</h3>
<p>— Te Ye</p>
<p>"Wehrmacht," the official newspaper of the German Army General Staff, recently published an article. From reading it, one can see that Germany is extremely worried about the Soviet Union's military deployments along the Arctic coast, because it fears that if the Soviet Union seizes the mineral resources of the Scandinavian countries, it will be very unfavorable to Germany. Reading this article also reveals the reasons why Germany has been making every effort to win over the four countries in Scandinavia to conclude non-aggression pacts with it, and why Finland has been vigorously advocating the fortification of the Aaland Islands, while the Soviet Union has been vigorously opposing it. Currently, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden have all signed non-aggression treaties with Germany, but Finland has refused. As for the issue of fortifying the Aaland Islands, Finland, intimidated by the power of the Soviet Union, is reportedly going to give up.</p>
<p>The desolate Murman coast lies on the edge of Northern Europe. There are no forests there. Only moss grows on the rocks. Even if there are trees, they are only a few stunted ones, swaying precariously. The strong winds blowing from the Arctic Ocean sweep into the Kola Peninsula, and are unstoppable. However, the warm Gulf Stream has chosen this place as its stopping point, so the coastal area is free from ice all year round. Perhaps another generation will pass before Europeans are willing to live there. If there is no significant progress in science, then these remote corners of the Arctic Ocean will remain the same as they have been for centuries, without any inhabitants.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Arctic attack base has become a reality. A country encompassing two continents has established such a strong base in this far northwest corner. This is a natural result of Russia's active diplomatic policy. Moreover, the Soviet Union is the successor to the Tsarist Empire, and naturally will not relax its grip on a single step, as it has a great political game to play.</p>
<p>Peter the Great was the first to organize the poorly trained troops of Great Russia to back up his clear diplomatic policies. He had two goals: (1) "To open a window to the West" and gain insight into Europe; (2) To become a maritime power. He never achieved the latter goal, and neither did any of the Russian emperors who followed him.</p>
<p>Until recently, Russia had no channel to the sea. Someone said: "Russia's only gateway to the sea is this Murman coast abandoned by God" and there is no other place. This may seem absurd, but a look at the map of Russia confirms that this is indeed the case. Although Russia has the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea as its borders, both places can be blocked by smaller countries in the event of war. Moreover, the Russian corner of the Baltic Sea is frozen for several months of the year. Vladivostok freezes in the winter and faces Japan, so it cannot be considered a "useful window on the Pacific." As for the remaining Arctic coast, it is far from the country's industrial centers, and can only be accessed for a little over two months of the year. Even when it is accessible, it is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Therefore, Russia only has the 200 miles of land along the Murman coast in the far north that is ice-free all year round. However, heavy ships can only find anchorages in an area of less than about 50 miles.</p>
<p>One of the Soviet Union's main goals is to gain the status of a world power. If this is the case, then the first step must be to become a maritime power. Stalin, the sole heir to the Tsar, ordered that no expense be spared to reach the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore used manpower, materials, and money on a grand scale to achieve this goal. The Murman Railway was completed long ago, and it is said that double tracks have now been laid, or that the line has been electrified by hydroelectric plants. The branch lines leading to the Finnish border will also be completed or are under construction. The road network is also constantly expanding, especially the work in Karelia.</p>
<p>Military mobilization requires good transportation lines. According to news from the north, the current transportation is sufficient to move several divisions of troops. Another transportation artery from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea has directly connected Leningrad to the Arctic ports, which has reduced the sea journey around the Scandinavian Peninsula by half. Unfortunately, that canal is also blocked by ice for half the year.</p>
<p>The Kola Peninsula has abundant and important raw materials, such as apatite for making phosphorus, as well as iron, nickel, and other metals. Even in southern Karelia, important treasures have been discovered.</p>
<p>In recent years, the population has increased rapidly, exceeding many times the previous number. The majority of Finnish-speaking residents, originally in Russian Karelia, have gradually moved out. A large area along the Finnish border has no civilians living there, and is garrisoned by crack troops. These huge numbers of special border guards are directly controlled by the secret military affairs department. In this Arctic and sub-Arctic land with a sparse population, it is extremely important to station well-trained air force units. Therefore, many airfields have been built. No one knows how many there are or what their capacity is. It is said that two of them each have hangars that can accommodate 40 aircraft.</p>
<p>The Murman Railway is 1,000 miles long and terminates in Murmansk. This was originally an insignificant place, but in the past ten years, the population has increased to over 100,000, and modern docks and harbor facilities have been built. Arctic icebreakers and fishing boats are moored there, and foreign trade income is increasing year by year. 20 miles north of Murmansk is Polyarnoye (formerly Aleksandrovsk). The fortresses in the town are constantly being reinforced with military equipment. The long-range artillery can effectively prevent enemy ships from entering the 50-mile-long bay. Currently, only smaller warships are moored there, such as torpedo cruisers, mine boats, submarines, auxiliary ships, and even aircraft carriers. Last year, according to news from certain sources, there were 25 torpedo boats and 15 submarines in the harbor, all of which were recently built. The submarine equipment can be used as mine-laying vessels. Today, even Sweden feels threatened by the Soviet Navy in the Arctic. Most importantly, it is said that several new cruisers, which will soon be completed, will be assigned to serve in the Arctic Ocean. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Intense Battles with Japanese Troops Invading the Jiangsu-Anhui Border, More Than Two Thousand Troops Dispatched in Seven Routes, Exhausting Their Tactics, They Resort to Poison Gas</h3>
<p>Correspondent in Xuzhou: The Japanese troops in Xuzhou consider the guerrilla units in the Jiangsu-Anhui border area to be very active, and intend to actively carry out their so-called "mopping up" plan before the green crops grow tall. In the middle of last month, they dispatched troops to attack the Chinese army positions in Xiao, Su, and other counties west of the Jinpu Railway. On the 29th, they were equipped with more than 300 troops, 14 cars, 2 armored vehicles, and 1 plane, and occupied Shicun. On the 30th, they occupied Yinjihu. On the 31st, Shuanggo, Xuzhou, Suining, Jiagou, Fuliji, Shicun, and other Japanese troops launched seven routes, a total of more than 2,000 people, more than 90 cars, 15 tanks, and more than 20 flat-firing guns, and attacked Zhangshan, Chulan, Shixiang, Mengzhai in Xiao County, Dahong, Li Chuanqiao, Qianyang Meishan in Lingbi, and Da Li Ji, etc. in Sui County. The Chinese guerrillas of the × Column and the Lingbi Regular Army first came into contact with the Japanese troops in Shuanggo Fangcun in the Dahongli area, and there were casualties on both sides. Subsequently, the Lingbi Regular Army fought with the Japanese army to seize the major hills several times. Although the Japanese army fired more than a hundred shells, the Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese army did not succeed. At the same time, ×× Detachment also encountered the Japanese army in Dayang Qianyang Meishan Zhangshan Chunshu Wang Sunzhai Mengzhai and other places, and fought fiercely. Nearly a thousand Japanese troops in Zhangshan Meishan Mengzhai fought with the Chinese × Route Army to seize the hills, which were lost and recaptured several times. The Japanese troops, exhausting their tactics, disregarded humanity and fired poison gas three times, causing hundreds of casualties among the Chinese × Route Army. Also, the Chinese Security Regiment, the × Commissioner, and the × County Regular Army contacted the Japanese army in the Chulan Shixiang Gongshan area and sacrificed valiantly. After holding out until the afternoon, the Chinese troops temporarily moved to suitable locations to reorganize their troops and plan another counterattack. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 300 casualties, destroyed 9 cars and 2 tanks. The Chinese troops also suffered heavy casualties, but the Japanese army's "mopping up" did not succeed. The next day, they returned to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Mobilization Committee, Unified Title</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization Committee, recently telegraphed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Lu-Su War Zone, was ordered by the Military Commission of the National Government to investigate that the mobilization agencies in various places have many names and complex organizations, and their drawbacks are either mutual shirking, waiting and hesitating, or acting independently, with divergent opinions, and the people do not know what to do. In order to unify the names and unify the authority, all should be reorganized into mobilization committees, prefixed with the words "Lu-Su War Zone," "a certain province," "a certain city," or "a certain county." All mobilization matters shall be the responsibility of the said committee. In addition to separate orders, a joint order is hereby issued that you faithfully comply with the reporting requirements and transfer the order to your subordinates to comply with it in its entirety, etc. After receiving the order, the said committee immediately prefixed the name with the words "Lu-Su War Zone" and slightly revised the rules of procedure to facilitate the progress of the war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Inside Huai'an City: Internal Strife Between Japanese and Puppet Troops; Mutual Casualties</h3>
<p>Bao Ying Correspondence: According to news from Huai'an, on the morning of the 16th, puppet troops inside the city, due to the severe oppression by Korean soldiers, a small unit of puppet troops intended to revolt. This was detected by the Korean soldiers, and a sudden clash erupted. For a time, the sound of machine guns and rifles roared, ceasing only after an hour. Both sides suffered casualties. Furthermore, cracks have also appeared within the Japanese army inside the city. Coupled with the threat from the Chinese army in the suburbs, they are extremely frightened. On the evening of the 16th, a unit of about seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers marched out of the city and stationed themselves outside the South Gate at places like Baiyi'an Wharf and Zhunti Temple. Several Japanese soldiers were dispatched to survey the area and draw maps. Around 7 PM, they fired three blank shots as a show of force, and only returned to the city at dawn. At around 10 AM on the morning of the 17th, dense machine gun fire, numbering in the hundreds of rounds, was heard near the Xiaojiaochang (small drill ground) inside the city. In the suburbs, there were intermittent noises and shouts. Detailed information is still being gathered.</p>
<h3>Border of Wu and Qing: Struggle for Shuangta Town; Japanese Casualties Exceed Half; Puppet Troops Annihilated</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Shuangta Town, located on the border of Wu and Qing counties, is situated on the shore of Dian Shan Lake, making its terrain very strategic. After the troops crossing the Yangtze River from Zhejiang Province, they recovered the town. The Japanese army repeatedly launched counterattacks with significant military force, but all attempts failed. On the 23rd of this month, the Suzhou Japanese Army Headquarters ordered over two hundred soldiers from the Jin Cang unit in Jiaozhi Town, together with over one hundred men under Zhang Zhixiong of the First Brigade of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police, to invade the town. Before the invasion, two merchant ships and over thirty civilian boats were seized. Subsequently, due to rain, the operation was postponed until daybreak on the 24th, when they finally set out, heading straight for Shuangta. The puppet troops led the way, while the Japanese army suppressed from behind. However, the Chinese army had already received intelligence, so they evacuated the residents in advance. When the Japanese and puppet troops landed, the Chinese army, ambushed in the shops in the town, launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army, caught off guard, couldn't land and had to lie prone in their boats, hastily fighting back. The puppet troops leading the way were caught in the crossfire between the Chinese and Japanese armies, and before they could fight, they were all killed in the water within half an hour. The Japanese army bringing up the rear also collapsed in disarray after an hour. In this battle, the Japanese and puppet troops left behind over one hundred and several dozen bodies, over one hundred rifles, and two machine guns. The number of Japanese soldiers wounded and killed in the boats is unknown. The Chinese army, due to careful planning, suffered minimal losses. Furthermore, it is reported that the Japanese army retreating from the battle, in their eagerness to escape, increased the horsepower of the small steamboat they had seized, causing the engine to malfunction mid-way. They were forced to stop in Cheng Lake within the Chenmu Town boundary of Wu County. At that time, the Japanese army forcibly accused the Chinese driver of the boat of deliberately obstructing them, so they shot and killed several sailors on one of the boats to vent their anger over the defeat.</p>

<h3>Women Who Have Just Finished Menstruation Are More Likely to Enthusiastically Flirt with Their Husbands</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labour University</p>
<p>If there is no initiation of reproductive behavior between husband and wife, they naturally cannot get along well. Therefore, reproductive behavior is indeed an indispensable and important element after marriage. Usually, the husband is in the active position in initiating this reproductive behavior. However, only during the period when the wife has just finished menstruation does the situation reverse. At this time, the wife begins to feel the interest in reproduction and will use various methods to seduce her husband, causing his sexual desire to surge, in order to satisfy her sensuality. This is because women have a sexual tide that repeats itself in cycles. The peak of this tide is when menstruation ends. Therefore, researchers in biology even compare a woman's menstruation to the mating season of animals, and even consider the menstrual period to be a variation of the mating season. Although this may not be entirely believable, it is not without considerable insight. Therefore, there are many women who are usually extremely demure, chaste, and do not smile easily, but suddenly change their demeanor during their menstrual period. This is related to various aspects of the nervous system, not just sexual desire. However, the impulse of reproductive desire must also be regarded as a powerful main reason, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Menstruation is a necessary physiological phenomenon for every woman. However, if women who have just finished menstruating feel sexually starved, then husbands should also be discerning and not let them feel disappointed. Moreover, menstruation only occurs once a month. One or two sexual acts per month cannot be considered indulgence. However, the question lies in the husband's energy, whether he is able to cope. If his energy is scattered and he has a history of premature ejaculation, the consequences will be worrying. The reason for discord between husband and wife may lie in this. However, it is not difficult to remedy this deficiency. Based on my 20 years of experience in treating kidney deficiency, purchasing and taking the German testicular essence preparation "Body康" for men is the most effective. After taking it, primordial yang is abundant, and premature ejaculation and impotence are swept away. The women's version has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility. Now, I will cite an example of a patient's treatment to prove the efficacy of this preparation.</p>
<p>The patient, Luo Aomin, is 29 years old (self-reported). Due to excessive indulgence in his youth, he suffered from premature ejaculation and impotence after marriage. Every time he had intercourse, the longest time he could last was no more than fifty seconds. Sometimes, he even suffered from penile erection problems. Therefore, although he had been married for six years, he had no children. (Treatment process). I instructed him to pay attention to his health and prescribed a large dose of "Body康", along with daily electrotherapy. After twelve weeks, his sexual function was active and healthy, and his energy was abundant. His health recovered.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>The Problem of Prostitutes and Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States</p>
<p>There is an old saying in our country, "Home flowers do not smell as sweet as wild flowers." Therefore, even men who have wives often like to frequent brothels, indulging in pleasure. As a result, they often contract gonorrhea, and their innocent wives suffer, with leucorrhea and hidden diseases emerging endlessly. Furthermore, young people in the spring of sexual arousal, with weak wills, are easily lured by bad friends and lose themselves in brothels. Or, they are trapped by economic difficulties and unable to marry, so they pluck flowers and climb willows, seeking temporary comfort for their spirit and body.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the rampantness of gonorrhea is originally due to the general bitterness of sexual life. On the other hand, because gonorrhea itself is difficult to treat, it lingers and spreads, leading to transmission and varied changes. If general membrane-permeable sterilization therapy or chemical therapy is used, it will not be able to fulfill the responsibility of completely curing gonorrhea. This is because such therapies can only exert a superficial sterilization effect on the local area, but their side effects are significant. After taking them, the stomach is irritated, vomiting increases frequently, and dizziness and facial pallor occur. Therefore, countries around the world no longer trust these therapies and enthusiastically promote the application of "克淋儂" (Kelinnong), invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, as its efficacy is the most significant. As a result, excellent results have been achieved. This is because "克淋儂" is based on the non-specific therapy of gonorrhea, made from a mixture of protein and yellow pigment. After a long period of experimentation, it is known that after taking this medicine, it can boost the cellular anti-gonorrheal phagocytic effect. Thus, both male and female gonorrhea can be guaranteed to be completely cured. For acute and chronic prostatitis, orchitis, urethritis, cystitis, and other conditions, "克淋儂" is also effective and can be completely cured in three to five weeks. On the one hand, "抗淋水" (Anti-Gonorrhea Water) can be used externally to wash the urethra according to the diagram and instructions. As for female gonorrhea leucorrhea, "卡而雪地陰道片" (Ka'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets) can be used externally as suppositories, while also taking "克淋儂" internally, which can also achieve rapid results and a thorough cure.</p>
<h3>People Prone to Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The origin of lung disease stems from the transmission of tuberculosis bacteria, which usually occurs before the age of twenty. People with weak bodies, narrow chests, and incomplete development are most susceptible to infection. Therefore, people with the above-mentioned conditions must take strict precautions. The precursor to lung disease is often a persistent cough. Therefore, patients with persistent coughs that are not cured should also be vigilant about the arrival of lung disease. Since coughing is the precursor to lung disease and patients lack effective medications, I, in my capacity as a doctor, dare to introduce the medicine "補肺拿爾" (Bufei Na'er). This medicine definitely has the function of relieving coughs, resolving phlegm, and treating the lungs. Therefore, no matter how stubborn the cough is, taking "補肺拿爾" can quickly produce results. For treating the lungs, this preparation certainly has special efficacy. Regardless of whether it is stage one, two, or three lung disease, taking this preparation can truly have the magic of bringing back spring. Patients should not delay themselves.</p>
<h3>Example of Cured Spermatorrhea: Neurasthenia Caused by Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>The patient, Dong Qimin, is from Taixian County, Jiangsu Province, and is 25 years old (self-reported). He committed masturbation when he was fifteen or sixteen years old. He knew the harm and quit, but he inevitably often imagined lewd scenes. As a result, he often discharged semen. Over time, a small amount of semen flowed out during defecation or erection. Needless to say, he suffered from nocturnal emission. His memory was greatly reduced. He often felt palpitations. He felt tired after doing a little work. He was mentally depressed and extremely pessimistic. (Treatment process). I first prescribed "耐而斯遺精片" (Nai'ersi Spermatorrhea Tablets) to stop spermatorrhea. I also prescribed a large dose of "補體康" (Body康) to replenish weakness. After two months, the disease was cured, and both his mind and body were extremely healthy.</p>
<h3>A Case of Rescue for Someone Suffering from Underdevelopment</h3>
<p>The patient, Wu Jianping, is from Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, and is 20 years old (self-reported). Since he was about ten years old, he enjoyed fondling his genitals, which later turned into masturbation. When he was fifteen or sixteen years old, he should have been developing, but this was destroyed and caused developmental obstacles. Therefore, although he is now twenty years old, his genitals are still like those of a child. Spermatorrhea occurs as often as twice a week. (Treatment process). He was prescribed "耐而斯遺精片" (Nai'ersi Spermatorrhea Tablets) and "補體康" (Body康). Along with daily electrotherapy, he was cured after three months.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<h3>The Leucorrhea that Wives and Children Resent</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "One person does the deed, one person takes the blame." This is a general statement that when a person does something wrong, they bear the responsibility themselves. But when you get sick, especially gonorrhea, if you are not careful, your wife will have to share the burden with you. So if you have a wife, it is best to cure your gonorrhea before living together to avoid spreading the infection and never being able to cure it completely. It creates a messy and unpleasant situation, and the wife and children resent you. Isn't that your own fault? The most easily overlooked aspect by gonorrhea patients is the condition of chronic para-urethritis. Because after the acute phase passes, the pain subsides, and the patient no longer worries about it, indulging themselves as if they were never sick. The terrible gonorrhea toxin then spreads to the wife. Sometimes, because the patient believes they have fully recovered, they see their wife's lower body developing gonorrhea leucorrhea and suspect her of infidelity. Isn't that a deep injustice? Therefore, a wise husband must quickly cure his own gonorrhea to maintain the love of his wife. Otherwise, not only will the gonorrhea toxin spread to his wife, but the baby during childbirth will pass through the birth canal and the leucorrhea will enter the eyes, risking blindness. I have seen many patients in my clinic who complain about this suffering. However, if one can take the special gonorrhea medicine "克淋儂" (Kelinnong) and use German static electricity therapy, because "克淋儂" has superior sterilizing power that far exceeds the general chemical therapies on the market, and if one can use static electricity therapy to unleash the sterilizing power of this drug, a quick recovery can be achieved. In addition to taking "克淋儂" orally, women can also use "卡而雪地陰道片" (Ka'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets) externally as suppositories for a short-term cure. Clinic Hours: 10 AM to 6 PM From today onwards, 20 appointments are offered daily. Each appointment costs only 5 jiao and includes a free copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Swimming Competition: Many Difficulties; Hong Kong Lacks Talent and Faces Economic Panic</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) Regarding the Hong Kong-Shanghai interport swimming and ice hockey competition, the Victoria Recreation Club of Hong Kong received a letter from the Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association inviting the Hong Kong team to go north at the end of this swimming season to resume the competition. However, before the establishment of a swimming association here, preparation is extremely difficult. At the same time, the problems of personnel and finance are also difficult to solve. The Shanghai side has notified the Victoria Recreation Club that, due to the sudden increase in exchange rates, they cannot send a team to the south. Moreover, this year it is Hong Kong's turn to go to Shanghai, so it is impossible to ask Shanghai to come to Hong Kong. The future of this year's interport competition is particularly bleak. Hong Kong's biggest problem is the lack of personnel. Laurence, the champion of all Hong Kong and interport championships, has just returned to Hong Kong from his honeymoon and is starting to practice. Li, who is most promising, has left Hong Kong, and Luo Chai has gone to Manila, so the Hong Kong team is indeed facing a shortage of talent. Chen Qisong, the former Chinese champion in the 50, 100, and 200-meter freestyle, is also currently in Hong Kong, but his performance has declined. The second obstacle to the interport competition is the financial problem. In the past, the expenses for the Hong Kong interport team's travel were actually borne by the Victoria Recreation Club, or it would rely on the ticket revenue from the inter-club competitions between the Victoria Recreation Club and various swimming clubs in Hong Kong to make up for it, it is said.</p>

Therefore, they specially convened a meeting of all team members at Guoguang Middle School the day before yesterday (24th) to discuss important team affairs. The resolutions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>* Continue to participate in this year's volleyball league organized by the Chinese Youth Association in the name of Youxing.</p>
<p>* In addition to the old team members, new team members will be introduced at discretion to promote the rising stars.</p>

<h3>Finance: Silver Plunges; Gold Prices Soar; The Rich Restore Their Thoughts of Hoarding; The Market Suddenly Feels Supply Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot red gold market, which had been trending downwards for five consecutive days, suddenly rebounded sharply, rising as much as 2,575 yuan at one point. This was mainly because silver prices had plummeted overseas and the situation in Tianjin had eased slightly, causing foreign exchange rates to suddenly tighten. As a result, people's confidence suddenly turned firm, and the local wealthy restored their thoughts of hoarding and storage, and entrusted the exchange industry to compete for purchases. Although securities firms and certain banks and spot gold firms successively released their holdings, it still felt like supply fell short of demand, causing market prices to rise frequently. However, before the close of the evening, prices fell slightly due to profit-taking, but the market trend remained extremely firm, closing at 2,568 yuan, a rebound of 68 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active throughout the day, reaching more than 700 taels. Gold jewelry prices also increased by eight yuan in a row, while the prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Red Gold Jumps 68 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the buying interest of the exchange industry was quite strong for each bar (ten taels), and the sellers were reluctant to sell due to the sudden tightening of foreign exchange rates. The market opened at 9:40 am and immediately raised the price by 10 yuan. An exchange firm bought 20 taels from a spot gold firm at a price of 10,510 yuan. Subsequently, another exchange firm also bought 30 taels from a securities firm at a price of 12 yuan. At that time, the northern firms entrusted securities firms and exchange firms to successively provide supply, causing a slight pullback. An exchange firm sold 50 taels to a gold jewelry firm on behalf of the northern firms at a price of 10 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm also sold 10 taels to a gold firm at a price of 0.08 yuan. Later, an exchange firm sold 50 taels to a gold jewelry firm on behalf of the northern firms at a price of 0.09 yuan. Soon after, the securities firm sold another 10 taels to a gold firm at a price of 0.08 yuan. After that, the northern firms stopped selling, and the price suddenly rose by 6 yuan. An exchange firm bought 10 taels from a gold jewelry firm at a price of 14 yuan. Subsequently, the gold jewelry firms bought 30 taels from a spot gold firm at the same price. At that time, foreign exchange rates continued to tighten, and a certain exchange firm had a strong buying interest, coupled with a severe shortage of sellers, the price rose by another 6 yuan in an instant. A certain exchange firm bought 50 taels from a gold firm at a price of 20 yuan, and then flew up another 5 yuan. A certain exchange firm bought another 20 taels from a gold jewelry firm at a price of 25 yuan. Soon after, the price rose again by 5 yuan. A certain exchange firm bought another 30 taels from a gold jewelry firm at a price of 30 yuan. At that time, sellers became more scarce, and the price soared by another 10 yuan. An exchange firm bought 10 taels from a certain bank at a price of 40 yuan. Later, a certain exchange firm came to buy again, but fortunately, the willingness of other firms to supply was still good, so the situation turned flat. A certain exchange firm bought 100 taels from other firms at a price of 35 yuan and 37 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange rates tightened again, and another exchange firm also stopped selling and turned to buying, so the price rose again, soaring by 9 yuan in an instant. An exchange firm bought 50 taels from a certain bank at a price of 46 yuan, and then rose by another 8 yuan. Exchange firms did 50 taels with each other at a price of 54 yuan. At noon, it was heard that the black market US exchange rate had broken the 13 yuan mark, causing sellers to disappear, and the price soared again by 10 yuan. Exchange firms did 30 taels with each other, with 64 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the market trend was quite firm because foreign exchange rates continued to soften after the close. The market opened high by 5 yuan. Gold firms did 50 taels with each other at a price of 70 yuan. At that time, the buying interest of exchange firms was eager, and the price soon rose by 5 yuan. Exchange firms did 20 taels with each other at a price of 75 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms sold 50 taels to exchange firms at a price of 74 yuan. After that, retail investors and spot gold firms took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the market pulled back downwards. A spot gold firm sold 20 taels to an exchange firm at a price of 67 yuan. Later, exchange firms did 50 taels with each other, and the price returned to a high of 71 yuan. At 2:50 pm, exchange firms did 50 taels with each other, at 2,568 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 68 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 67 yuan for the whole day. The capital of spot gold firms was 10 yuan higher than that of spot red gold. The current standard gold price is hanging about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and it is said that there are very few transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Prices Rise Eight Yuan in a Row</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry in gold shops did not change at first. However, at 10:20 am, because the potential of spot red gold was firm, all were listed at 261 yuan for Da Tong Hang, and 259 yuan for Xin Tong Hang, with a purchase price of 253 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>According to the London telegram on the 27th, the price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged, at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence, so the market prices of various banks of the Central Bank were also consistently flat. The purchase price of Chinese cash was 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao, the listed customs gold price was 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li, and the Shanghai standard gold price was 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Economic Meaning of the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions</h3>
<p>By Gu Xiaohui</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, Japan, using the excuse of not obtaining the extradition of the suspect in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the "President of the Joint Reserve Bank of Tianjin" in the British Concession of Tianjin, implemented a blockade of the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. Today is the fourteenth day. The Japanese side openly said, "The sword has been drawn," and the door to negotiations has been closed. The blockade policy will not be abandoned unless Britain completely shows its submission to Japan. On the British side, they are preparing for action, and suddenly their attitude is strong, wanting to retaliate; but according to recent news, Britain and Japan are negotiating again in Tokyo, so Britain can be said to be able to endure humiliation for the sake of preserving the overall situation in dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>(1) Excluding the Trade of the Three Countries in the North China Market</p>
<p>Why does Japan want to blockade the British Concession in Tianjin? Superficially, it is for political reasons, but in reality, it is an economic conspiracy for the trade of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France in China. Except for Shanghai, which represents Central China as a port of entry and exit and accounts for the largest part of the country; in North China, Tianjin is the hub. The trade of the three countries in Tianjin, taking the United States alone, usually reaches more than 200 million yuan per year. Originally, the trade of various countries in China, especially the United States, Britain, and Japan, was fiercely competitive. Since Japan invaded North China, it has implemented control over the ports of North China, such as Qingdao. Because there are concessions in Tianjin, the commerce of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France can take advantage of this to operate, which is what the Japanese side is jealous of. For example, in the Tianjin market, the famous businesses of the United States and Britain include the British-American Tobacco Company, the Asia and other oil companies, and various import and export merchants, purchasing raw materials such as wool, cotton, fur, bristles, eggs, etc., further forming conflicts with the Japanese side. All these activities are within the concessions, and the Japanese side has no right to interfere, so the Japanese side is jealous and angrily resorted to the blockade. This is one of the most important reasons for the blockade.</p>
<p>(2) Threatening the Activities of Chinese and Foreign Banks in the Concessions</p>
<p>The activities of Chinese and foreign banks in the Tianjin Concessions are also something that the Japanese side is unhappy about. Currently, the Chinese and foreign banks in the Tianjin Concessions include:</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>Issued Amount (Unit: Thousand Yuan)</p>
<p>Central Bank 32,343 yuan</p>
<p>Bank of China 115,161 yuan</p>
<p>Bank of Communications 55,840 yuan</p>
<p>British Merchants Paid-up Capital</p>
<p>Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation 50,000 thousand Hong Kong dollars</p>
<p>Mercantile Bank 3,000 thousand pounds</p>
<p>American Merchants</p>
<p>Citibank 127,500 thousand US dollars</p>
<p>American Express Bank 6,000 thousand US dollars</p>
<p>Chase Bank 5,000 thousand US dollars</p>
<p>Commercial Credit Bank 48 thousand US dollars</p>
<p>French Merchants</p>
<p>Banque de l'Indochine 120,000 thousand French francs</p>
<p>Because there are such Chinese and foreign financial institutions, foreign merchants can still operate businesses in Tianjin. In order to exclude the trade of Britain and the United States in the North China market, the Japanese side is threatening the activities of these banks. At the same time, because the foreign banks in the concessions are not bound by exchange restrictions, and the Japanese banks must maintain a fixed exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, foreign merchants can use the low exchange rate to give exporters extra convenience, so that the foreign exchange that North China exports should have obtained flows into foreign banks. Japanese banks have no third-country foreign exchange transactions, and these banks all use legal tender as currency, so Japan believes that the existence of these banks is destroying its "new currency system policy" and cannot implement its control system. This is also a reason. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rebounds Sharply; Tianjin Firms and Sassoon Fight to Buy; Foreign Firms Have Many Settlements at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed price. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, the market trend was relatively stable at first because Japanese banks continued to sell. After 9:30 am, it was heard that the relationship between Britain and Japan in Tianjin was slightly easing, and in addition, foreign banks were profitable (on behalf of Tianjin firms) and Western merchant Sassoon and others struggled to buy, and foreign firms had many settlements due to the imminent end of the month. Furthermore, foreign banks were reluctant to sell, and they were unwilling to sell unless the price was high, so under the intense buying pressure, the market rebounded sharply, recovering almost half of the five-day decline. Although foreign cables reported that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Indian Silver Company were selling, the banks in this city only had buying prices and no selling prices, resulting in a situation where demand exceeded supply. It was heard that the British gold interest rate tightened to 6 pence 59375 after the close, and the US exchange rate also softened to 12 yuan 8125. In addition, the exchange rate between British and American currencies rebounded, so the British exchange rate was more tight than the American exchange rate, and there was no turning back in the middle. Trading was quite active during the morning, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened sharply by one yuan, softening to around 45 yuan 125.</p>
<p>US Exchange Rate Enters the 13 Yuan Mark Again</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London bulk order price, both near and far, dropped sharply by 6895, and the New York silver price also shrank sharply by three points. The London raw gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American currencies was one cent and three mils higher, the exchange rate to Shanghai was 0.0625 higher, and the exchange rate to France was one cent higher. The exchange rate of American to British currencies rose by 0.0625, the exchange rate to Shanghai remained unchanged, and the exchange rate to France was 0.0625 higher. The listed prices of various currencies in the Central Bank remained the same. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 6 pence 875 and the US exchange rate at 13 yuan 40625. There were no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, although the Japanese banks continued to sell, the foreign banks had a good appetite, so there were few changes. It is estimated that the Japanese banks sold spot British gold at 6 pence 875 to HSBC. When the HSBC listed price was announced, it did not change, and the silver balance tax was announced to be exempt (because the bulk order price started to be levied at 19 pence 1875). After that, although the Japanese banks continued to have a willingness to sell, Western merchant Sassoon vigorously settled, and various foreign firms also started to compete for purchases, and the supply of various foreign banks was sluggish, so the situation gradually tightened. It is estimated that Sassoon bought spot British gold at 6 pence 8125 from the Japanese banks, and then the foreign firms settled spot British gold with HSBC and Wahbi at 6 pence 75, and also bought spot US exchange from Datong and a certain bank for 13 yuan 25. Although foreign cables from Hong Kong and the Indian Silver Company supplied and maintained, Sassoon was still buying non-stop, and the Tianjin firms had a strong appetite, so it still felt like a drop in the bucket, and the situation continued to tighten sharply. It is estimated that Sassoon and Yuli (on behalf of the Tianjin firms) competed to buy spot British gold from the Hong Kong Cable, the Indian Silver Company, and foreign banks from 6 pence 75, tightening to 625, and bought spot US exchange from 13 yuan 25 softening to 13 yuan. It was already noon, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened to 45 yuan 125. Extending to the midday close, the banks' spot selling price was British gold at 6 pence 625, and the US exchange rate had broken into 13 yuan, at 12 yuan 96875, which was close to HSBC's maintenance price. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate tightened by 25, and the US exchange rate softened by 4375. The Hong Kong exchange rate also rose by one yuan. It was heard that after the close of the spot British and American exchange rates, the buying interest of the buyers was still strong, so the market trend continued to tighten. The British gold exchange rate had tightened to 6 pence 59375, and the US exchange rate had softened to 12 yuan 8125. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Settlement Period Nears, Yarn Market Struggles to Recover, Inter-trade Transactions Sharply Decline, Prices Fall by 500-700 Yuan</h3>
<p>Spot trading of cotton yarn is limited, but the trend is looser in the morning and tighter in the afternoon. Ultimately, 20-count Double Horse yarn remained at the same level as the previous day, while other yarns fell by about 3-4 yuan. Market sentiment remains mixed. However, many speculative bulls, facing urgent credit needs and the approaching end of the Year of the Ox, must unload their goods for cash to settle their accounts. Inter-trade buying and selling has significantly decreased, and even certain large firms are experiencing similar difficulties, with new settlements in the market. This explains the weakness in morning prices. Major players are waiting for the issuance of exchange allocation certificates on July 4th and to assess whether the news is bullish or bearish before making a final decision, with most adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market opened flat in the afternoon, but news of slightly higher gold prices revitalized the market, and prices rebounded by 2-3 yuan. However, actual demand from customers remains sluggish due to the unfavorable environment. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse spot yarn was 477 yuan, soon falling to 474 yuan. Warehouse receipts initially traded at 473.5 yuan, then later at 471 yuan. The afternoon opening was flat, and following news of rising gold prices, there was another step up, with 20-count Double Horse spot yarn from external warehouses trading at 478 yuan, and warehouse receipts at 473 yuan. Ultimately, the day's total transaction volume was estimated at 800-900 bales, with inter-trade transactions still accounting for the majority. Double Horse prices were flat, while 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd yarns fell by 5-7 yuan, Double Globe fell by 4 yuan, and Special Golden City fell by 6.5 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn was unchanged. Today, 90 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Quanzhou.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remains quiet, but since delivery for this month's goods can be extended by half a month, market conditions have stabilized and prices have risen slightly. The price for this month's 20-count Moon Harp yarn is 380-382 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Delivery for This Month Extended by Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's telegram to Shanghai was followed by all banks and firms, Japanese yarn transactions have been done with full payment upfront, making operational procedures extremely difficult. With the end of this month (June) approaching, many disputes have arisen between buyers and sellers regarding the yarn. The Yarn Industry Association convened a meeting of traders to discuss the matter, resulting in the decision to extend the delivery period for transactions this month by two weeks, until July 14th.</p>
<h3>Banks Refuse to Provide Loans, Cotton Merchants Face Difficulties, Stocks Sold Off at Low Prices to Cover Exchange Drafts</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was firm yesterday, with a lively opening. Short covering and strong buying from the South were seen. Negotiations in Washington regarding barter trade are progressing smoothly. Spot traders were also active. As a result, New York rose by 7-8 points, and Indian cotton is also predicted to rise by one rupee, while Egyptian cotton fell by over 10 points.</p>
<p>Since the government issued an order restricting withdrawals in the Shanghai foreign cotton market, banks have refused to provide loans, resulting in an unusually tight credit situation. Moreover, with the end of June being the banks' settlement period, a large volume of goods has arrived by ship for foreign firms. Due to the timing of exchange drafts, the exchange rate difference between this month's drafts and next month's is enormous, reaching as much as 10 yuan per picul. Local firms face difficulties in raising funds, and foreign firms are pressing for payment. Therefore, they can only sell off their stocks at low prices to cover their exchange drafts. Foreign firms are also worried about difficulties in collecting payments, with both sides complaining endlessly.</p>
<p>Only one transaction of domestic cotton was completed, involving a mere 80 bales, an unprecedentedly low volume. Factories face unresolved issues regarding restricted withdrawals, preventing them from procuring raw materials for the time being. Even inter-trade buying and selling is fraught with disputes over payment upon delivery, making it difficult to resolve. Although there have been several meetings regarding factories allowing traders to take delivery and settle payments, no concrete results have been achieved, and the future remains uncertain. Only 311 bales of cotton from Subei arrived in Tongzhou. Today, 20 bales of cotton are being shipped to Quanzhou. Here is a record of the current cotton situation:</p>
<p>Xia Sha, American Upland, 93.00, Traded within the industry, 80 bales, Exchange allocation, warehouse delivery.</p>
<p>Bai Luo, Grade unknown, 87.50, Also, 300 pieces, Cash again.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Oil Market Cannot Operate, Bean Cakes Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The crude soybean oil market has been hampered by the withdrawal restrictions, making it difficult to operate. Even large, powerful traders feel overburdened and find it difficult to manage. Therefore, a suggestion has been made to limit the payment period for goods to 10 days (the industry rule is 15 days from the date of transaction). If the goods are not cleared within 10 days, 80% of the payment must be made, and all responsibilities are borne by the buyer. However, some have not agreed, so it has not been implemented and remains subject to verbal agreement. Yesterday, 20 barrels of crude soybean oil from Kobe and Dalian were traded on paper at a price of 47 yuan, a reduction of 70 cents from the previous day.</p>
<p>Although bean cakes are similarly constrained by the oil market, their price is lighter, making buying and selling easier to manage. However, judging by the season, it is now the active sales period. The market volume did not exceed 5,000 pieces. In short, this special situation is due to various environmental constraints. Yesterday, in addition to both sides matching 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji brand bean cake for June delivery at a price of 3 yuan for the original disc, other prices continued to fall. Yuanji brand traded 2,000 pieces at 2.97 yuan, and mixed brands traded 2,000 pieces at 2.95 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 110 pieces of soybean oil and 500 tins of sesame oil arrived from Yantai, Shandong, and 14,500 pieces of bean cake arrived. Additionally, 2,000 pieces of cottonseed cake arrived from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Today, 5,350 tins of crude oil are being shipped to Quanzhou, as are 580 bags of soybeans. Another 130 bags are being shipped to Hong Kong, and 2,100 pieces of bean cake are being shipped to Quanzhou.</p>
<h3>Securities: Stock Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce opened quietly yesterday. However, there was demand for several well-known industrial stocks during half-day trading, and transaction prices also made progress.</p>
<p>Transactions and Opening Prices:</p>
<p>Mutual Land: Selling price 33.25, Bidding price 33.25. Tramway: Selling price 39.50, 40.50. Jardine: Bidding price 18.20, 18.90.</p>
<p>There is still little interest in rubber stocks, but sellers are unwilling to sell at these low buying prices. The bond market is very sluggish.</p>
<p>London Stock Exchange quotations for Far Eastern companies on Tuesday, June 27th: The trend is stable, with no changes in any stocks. London quotations for Chinese foreign debt on Tuesday, June 27th: The downward trend has temporarily stopped, with no further price movements. 1,000 pounds of Jinghan Railway bonds were traded at an opening price of 16 pounds, down 1 pound from the market.</p>
<h3>Grain: Cash Position Not Ample, Flour Transactions Stalled, Japanese Mills Actively Buying Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour: Although there was an intention to procure in the wholesale market yesterday, it ultimately failed due to a lack of cash. Factories insisted on cash transactions and would not accept drafts, so the dull situation is unlikely to improve in the short term. Retail transactions on this street continued as usual at a cash price of 4.65 yuan, with only a few thousand bags changing hands. Both incoming and outgoing sales of foreign flour were quiet. Since being affected by cash payments, not only has wholesale demand been weak, but retail sales on this street have also been sluggish. The market price is around 5 yuan for national allocations, and the market is also brewing. Today, 28,900 bags of flour are being shipped to Quanzhou, as well as 1,100 bags of flour skins.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's supply was continuous. New wheat from various regions has reached the threshing season. However, due to the current financial crisis, both buyers and sellers are less active. Yesterday, demand from Chinese flour mills remained sluggish, while Japanese mills and local sales continued to be active. A total of over 900 bags of wheat from Danyang, Nanjing, and Caishiji were sold at prices ranging from 6.58 yuan to 6.53 yuan. There was no significant change in the market.</p>
<h3>Oversupply, Rice Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Du Geng: Yesterday, no supplies arrived from the various gangs in He Xia. 2,300-2,400 bags of Che Lun Bao Zi arrived from Changzhou, Nanxiang, and other places. Since the price limit on rice, people's hearts have calmed down, and hoarders have disappeared. All sales have been limited to retail stores on this street, causing concern among those holding goods, who are all trying to sell. The market supply has suddenly become crowded, making it even harder to maintain prices, and prices continued to depreciate. As a result, the price of both thick and thin Geng rice fell by 20 cents.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Production areas have been reporting small amounts for days, and affected by orders for foreign rice, large outside speculators are eager to sell at market prices. However, local demand has weakened as Geng Jian rice prices have flattened. Only 300-400 bags were procured from inland gangs yesterday, and the supply of mid-grade machine rice and broken rice is often high, with depreciated prices being sought to realize cash. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday morning, prices fell step by step. High-grade rice fell by 30-40 cents, while old and second-grade rice fell by 40-50 cents. Total transactions for the day were over 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Spot trading remains quiet. Sellers are asking 23 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, but even with freight and commissions included, there are few buyers. Future prices will inevitably need to be reduced again in order to be sold. As for new foreign rice orders, due to foreign exchange purchases and other related factors, the actual secured order quantity is not as large as rumored. It is said that only the first batch of 300 tons has been confirmed, and the second batch has only secured 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: The market for glutinous rice has been soft recently, and coinciding with the weakness in Geng Jian rice, prices have also fallen by half a yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Production Prices Rise Repeatedly, Ou-Yong Shipping Obstructed, Domestic Sugar Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegram reports, sugar prices have generally risen. Dutch raw white sugar for September/October delivery has seen a rebound, with prices at 8.00 Dutch guilders. The cost of Hong Kong raw white sugar, including bagging fees to Shanghai, has risen to 11.40 full-warehouse dollars. London telegraphs show a sharp increase of 6.25 pence for August, to 8 shillings 0.75 pence. December increased by 75 pence, to 6 shillings 5 pence. March of next year increased by 1.5 pence, to 6 shillings 5.5 pence. Therefore, the local chamber of commerce allocation disk has tightened slightly. Spot No. 24 raw white sugar rose by 20 cents. Local warehouses are at 29 yuan, and foreign warehouses are at 28.8 yuan. Transshipment goods rose by 10 cents, with 400 bags traded. Taikoo sugar rose by 1, 2, 3, and 4 cents in varying amounts. West Warehouse B mark is at 28.8 yuan, totaling 100 bags. CW mark is at 28.6 yuan, CX mark is at 28.4 yuan, DY mark is at 27.8 yuan, HY mark is at 27.6 yuan. Due to obstruction of Ou-Yong shipping, domestic sugar importers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, unlike the excitement of the previous few days. One firm sold 50 bags of mixed-grade Qing as a trial at 16 yuan, but has refused to continue selling at that price and remains tight. Moreover, shipping costs from Xiamen to Shanghai have increased by 25%, significantly increasing costs. Adding the discount on exchange allocation, the tightness is self-evident. Xinghua's ordinary Da Gongfen is offered at 27 yuan, but no transactions have occurred. Today, 15,000 bags of sugar are arriving from Holland.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Italian Artificial Silk Arrives Again</h3>
<p>Another large batch of artificial silk has arrived in Shanghai. On the 27th (the day before yesterday), the Italian ship Conte Biancamano arrived from Italy with 2,745 cases, which were unloaded at the Gonghexiang warehouse at the Red Mouth. Among them were also 95 cases of autumn woolen suit fabrics.</p>
<h3>The Coast is Unsettled, European Sales of Green Tea Are Increasingly Buoyant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm green tea market was increasingly robust. Due to the tense situation along the coast, exports of red and green tea from the interior are becoming increasingly difficult, making existing stocks in the Shanghai market even more valuable. British firms such as Jardine, Concord, Tongfu, and Baochang are all scrambling to procure tea. Transactions in Chun Mei are exceptionally active, and fine needle Mei is also becoming more active. The entire city traded a total of over 740 cases of green tea. Prices for plucked cores ranged from 295 yuan to 332 yuan. General Chun Mei prices ranged from 253 yuan to 276 yuan, and needle Mei prices ranged from 52 yuan to 88 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Galvanized Iron Pipe Prices High, Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>The largest market for galvanized iron pipes has always been waterworks. There are also transactions in Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and other places. Since the shortage of spot goods last year, prices have skyrocketed. However, due to the excessively high asking prices, actual sales have been greatly affected. Recently, spot goods have been arriving in large quantities, but there are still few buyers. Recently quoted prices, such as 4-fen pipes at 48 cents per foot, 6-fen pipes at 58 cents per foot, 1-inch pipes at 80 cents, 1.25-inch pipes at 1.40 yuan, 2-inch pipes at 1.85 yuan, and 3-inch pipes at 3.30 yuan, are all 10-20 cents and 80-90 cents higher than the previous market prices.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Many Goods Arrive from the Netherlands and Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large volume of goods arrived in Shanghai from the Netherlands, including 3,400 bags of tapioca starch, 8,000 bags of white wax, and 3,160 bags of coconut shells. In addition, 150 bags of pepper, 550 boxes of bark and rubber, and 290 boxes of coffee arrived from Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Gather Along the Coast, Traffic to Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian Temporarily Obstructed, Blockade Line at Zhenhai Port Being Prepared, Navigation on Fuzhou Route Also Appears to be Restricted</h3>
<p>British and American Warships Planned for Escort</p>
<p>Since naval authorities notified third-country vessels to refrain from sailing to Min and Ou River ports, all voyages to Wenzhou and other outbound ports have been suspended. The Italian merchant ship Kang Sa Yi, which was stranded in Wenzhou, also sailed for Shanghai yesterday morning. In Fuzhou, the British ships Shenfu and Shengu are berthed at Chuanshi for unloading. After the blockade of Ningbo, the Moufu ship was approved to make one more voyage. The ship is scheduled to depart this morning and return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. A blockade line at Zhenhai Port will be implemented if necessary. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Blockade Min and Ou River Ports</p>
<p>The Japanese naval authorities notified the Shanghai Consular Corps on the 26th that the Japanese military would take military action at the ports of Wenzhou and Fuzhou. Therefore, all third-country warships and merchant ships were requested to leave the above locations by noon on the 29th (today), otherwise the Japanese side would not be responsible for any damage. However, the British and American authorities have firmly rejected the Japanese note and will make serious representations to the Japanese side. According to the Japanese, dangerous materials will be placed at the entrances and exits of Min and Ou rivers to implement the blockade. The locations of the dangerous materials will be: (1) the central part of the north-south waterway in the eastern part of the Shatou Waterway in Wenzhou; (2) near the central floating pontoon in the eastern part of the Ironing Waterway in Fuzhou. All third-country nationals residing in these areas are advised to evacuate as soon as possible. However, according to inquiries from the shipping industry by reporters from the Dagang News Agency, no telegraphic notice of this information has been received. As for yesterday's newspaper report that navigation in Wenzhou was prohibited on the orders of the Chinese military authorities, it is clearly a mistake, as the shipping industry has not received any notification from the authorities regarding a ban on navigation.</p>
<p>Moufu to Make Last Voyage to Ningbo This Morning</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the defenses of the Zhenhai Port fortress, the Ningbo Defense Commander has decided to prohibit navigation. The three ships Xin Beijing, Deping, and Moufu, which were berthed in Ningbo, all sailed for Shanghai on the morning of the 27th and arrived at the port. However, the Moufu, belonging to the German merchant firm Lihe, was specially approved to make one more voyage for the last time. The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 4:00 a.m. this morning, arriving in Ningbo that evening, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow morning. After the ship leaves Ningbo, Zhenhai Port will be officially declared blockaded. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Dagang News Agency, the old Taiping ship, which is reserved to block the gap, is ready to be sunk and will be implemented when necessary. In addition, Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing ship has now been assigned to the new route Linqiu-Xiudu and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 30th).</p>
<p>Italian Ship Leaves Wenzhou, All Ships Suspend Navigation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese obstructed foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, the Haifu ship, which was stranded in Wenzhou, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Hana ship also arrived at the port yesterday afternoon. The Italian merchant ship Kang Sa Yi left Wenzhou at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning and sailed for Shanghai. There are currently no foreign ships in the Ou River. The Feikang, Baoli, Ende, and the Haifu and Hana, which were originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou, have all declared a temporary suspension of navigation and will decide again depending on how the situation develops.</p>
<p>Shenfu and Shengu Berth in Min River to Unload</p>
<p>As for the Fuzhou route, in addition to the regular sailings by ships of the British firm Yilong, the remaining ships of Taikoo, Jardine, and the Sino-Italian Company are all unscheduled. They have sailed to Min one after another in the past few days and telegraphed that they have safely arrived at Chuanshi outside Mawei Port, unloading cargo as usual. Whether they will sail again in the future will also depend on how the situation develops. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship, originally scheduled to sail to Xiuzhe near Quanzhou, which was newly opened yesterday, has been postponed by one day due to rumors of Japanese troops landing in the Min River. It is now scheduled to sail to Xiuzhe this morning. However, the Fuzhou route also appears to be in a state of suspension.</p>
<p>Yuhuan Island Unrelated to Military Affairs</p>
<p>Yuhuan County, Zhejiang, is an island surrounded by sea and is not important militarily. It is the same in nature as Dinghai County. The Japanese troops' landing at Kanmen in Yuhuan this time is just a bluff. It is not easy to advance on Yueqing from Yuhuan. Moreover, although there are highways connecting Yueqing, Haimen, and Wenzhou, heavy troops have been stationed and are heavily guarded. After the Japanese troops landed, they were met with fierce resistance from the Yuhuan self-defense forces.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Concentrate, Situation Tense</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that garrisons along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian have been ordered to be on strict alert to prevent Japanese troops from secretly landing. A large number of Japanese warships have concentrated at the mouths of the Min and Ou Rivers along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian, with some kind of attempt. Therefore, the situation along the coast is extremely tense, and the local forces will adopt emergency measures when necessary. Furthermore, Yueqing and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang have been bombed by Japanese aircraft for days.</p>
<p>Britain and America Prepare to Provide Vigorous Escort</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have resolutely rejected the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast and obstruction of navigation. The British Consul General has already responded the day before yesterday, stating that "the Japanese must not evade any responsibility for harming British lives and property, whether directly or indirectly." It has also been heard that British shipping companies such as Taikoo, Jardine, and Yilong have decided to maintain their original routes as usual in order to safeguard navigation along the Chinese coast, and will request British warships to provide escort when necessary.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Returns to Shanghai from Northern Sha Line, Escorted by British Warship</h3>
<p>Japanese Warships Block Foreign Ships from Advancing, Shipping to Shanghai Port Sharply Reduced, Companies Planning to Cope</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of war in the northern Sha area, Xin Port and Lingdian Port have been shelled by Japanese warships. Although foreign merchant ships are continuing to navigate, the destination has been changed to Qinglong Port. The number of passengers and cargo has been sharply reduced, severely impacting business, and they will be forced to suspend operations. The aim of this Japanese action is to monopolize shipping and seize cargo taxes from various ports. However, the Chinese military is determined to inflict a severe blow on the Japanese military. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>German Ship on Northern Sha Line Diverts to Qinglong</p>
<p>After Taikoo Company's Wantong ship suspended operations, the German Far East Company's Haiyi ship and Fuhua Company's Jiangding ship departed as usual at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. The number of passengers and cargo did not decrease. At about 2:00 p.m., they passed through Hutong Port, Shuji Port, and Niuhong Port and safely arrived at Qinglong Port. They sounded their sirens and launched rowboats to unload passengers and cargo into the port. The Japanese warship No. 32, which was anchored offshore, still signaled with flags, ordering the ships to anchor there overnight and preventing them from proceeding. They also aimed their guns at the two ships as a demonstration. The shipowners cancelled their sailing plans and decided to sail to Shanghai this morning. The British Jardine Company's Yihe ship was protected by a British warship and sailed back from Shanghai Port, arriving in Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Since the Japanese military blockaded the ports along the Northern Sha Line, the business of various ships has been sharply reduced, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, various companies will discuss how to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Aims to Monopolize Shipping</p>
<p>The Japanese have been coveting shipping on the Northern Sha Line for a long time and have long had the intention of monopolizing it. This time, taking advantage of the Japanese military's actions, they are obstructing the foreign ships purely to facilitate the sailing of ships of the Nissin Kisen Kaisha. Because the destination of the foreign ships is Qinglong Port, which is occupied by the Japanese military, they cannot compete with the Japanese ships for passengers and cargo in the port. As a result, they will be forced to suspend operations on their own. At the same time, the Japanese military can also search and seize the tax revenue from the Northern Sha Line.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Handles Mid-Year Closing Accounts</h3>
<p>All Banks Operate Cautiously and Maintain Profits, Capital Increases, Financial Stability to Increase in the Future</p>
<p>Tomorrow (June 30th) is the bank's mid-year closing period. Banks have been very busy handling the closing of accounts in recent days. Interest payments for both savings and commercial departments have been completed. Starting from July 1st, there will be a three-day holiday. Since the money industry decided on measures to stabilize the market, the financial market has stabilized. After the mid-year closing, the banks will prepare to handle the use of interbank exchange allocation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mid-Year Closing</p>
<p>In view of the upcoming mid-year bank closing on June 30th, all banks have started to handle the closing of accounts. Depending on the busy ness of the business, internal office hours have been extended. Interest closure for the savings department ended on the 20th, and interest closure for the commercial department ended on the 25th. They have now been completed one after another. The number of bill exchanges in the bill exchange has also increased. In accordance with the regulations of the Association, there will be a three-day holiday from July 1st, and business will open as usual on the 4th. The bank association's semi-annual member representative conference has been decided by the Standing Committee to suspend the convening.</p>
<p>Market Stability</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial market can still maintain its traditional importance. For example, international foreign exchange still centers on Shanghai, and domestic funds are concentrated in Shanghai. As a result, bank deposits have increased sharply, resulting in a surplus of funds. This spring, due to Shanghai's lack of proper means of application, illegitimate speculative businesses such as foreign exchange purchasing and cargo hoarding occurred. Generally, they were deposited and operated by the bank this illegitimate business. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian restricted withdrawals, so speculative businesses gradually decreased due to the lack of legal currency, and the financial market tended to stabilize.</p>
<p>All Achieve Profits</p>
<p>Due to the surge in population and urgent needs after the war, the industrial and commercial industries in Shanghai showed abnormal development. For example, the number of large and small factories newly established and resumed operations in the special zone has increased to 2,700-800. At the same time, the number of newly established stores has also sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, and the development is particularly visible. Banks have done their best to accept mortgage loans for the capital needs of industrial and commercial industries within the possible range. Therefore, it is generally expected that this mid-year closing can achieve considerable profits.</p>
<p>Chips Increase</p>
<p>The Bank Joint Reserve Committee has begun to handle the registration of interbank use of exchange allocations. All banks and firms that wish to receive allocations must provide collateral and apply to the Committee for receipt. It will be implemented starting from July 4th. The Federation has decided to issue interbank exchange allocation certificates in order to facilitate interbank exchange allocation and receipt. However, although the use of interbank exchange allocation and the issuance of exchange allocation certificates are both of an exchange allocation nature, they are slightly different. Currently, only the use of interbank exchange allocation is available, and the issuance of exchange allocation certificates is temporarily suspended. The improvement of this exchange allocation system is of great benefit to the entire industrial and commercial industry and can enable the market to increase chips with reliable guarantees.</p>
<p>Sufficient Funds</p>
<p>The total amount of interbank exchange allocation is tentatively set at 50 million yuan. After implementation, the assets of various banks, such as goods, securities, and real estate, can become new chips for exchange allocation. At the same time, the exchange allocations deposited by various banks and firms in the Bank Reserve Committee and the Money Industry Reserve will be allowed to be converted into legal currency at 95 percent over 12 weeks, which will increase the capital of the firms and can fully assist the development of the industrial and commercial industries. However, in order to prevent illegitimate speculative businesses, the Bank Reserve Committee will discontinue the business of interbank exchange allocation discounting from now on and hopes that the money exchange industry will also stop operating exchange allocation discounting.</p>
<h3>City Bank and Others to Refund Deposits: In Accordance with Ministry Orders for Withdrawals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bank and Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust Company, previously suspended operations from February 3, 1938, due to environmental factors, have now, upon resolution by the bank and trust's board of directors, decided to refund all types of deposit principal and interest in order to demonstrate good faith and restore confidence in the financial system.  Starting July 4th, the Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House will be entrusted to handle payments.  The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Refunding Depositors</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Municipal Bank was established in February of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) with a capital of one million national currency. It was initiated by Mayor Zhang Yuejun and served as the municipal treasury, managing all income and expenditures for Shanghai. The general manager was Xu Fu. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust Company was established in October of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). It was founded by the Shanghai Municipal Government with a capital of one and a half million national currency, managing the municipal ferry, Pudong Waterworks, etc. The general manager was Xu Fu. Since the fall of Shanghai and the retreat of the National Army, the bank and trust were forced to suspend operations from February 3, 1938, due to the environmental factors. Now, the bank and trust's board of directors has decided to refund all types of deposits in order to demonstrate good faith and restore confidence in the financial system, and the Clearing House will be entrusted to handle payments.</p>
<p>Entrusted Handling</p>
<p>The municipal bank board of directors and the trust company board of directors have announced that the payment agency will be located at the Banking Clearing House at 59 Hong Kong Road. All depositors of the bank and trust are requested to register their deposits at the payment agency between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM daily, starting July 4, 1939. After the registration procedures are completed, withdrawals will be made in succession from the payment agency starting ten days later, in accordance with Article 1 of the Financial Stability Measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on August 15, 1931 (each depositor may withdraw 5% of their deposit balance each week, with a maximum of 150 legal currency per household per week).</p>
<p>Settling Debts</p>
<p>Regarding the bank and trust's various debts, Attorney Xu Shihao has been entrusted to urge prompt settlement of debts. The announcement reads approximately as follows: According to representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Bank and Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust, the bank and trust urgently needs to actively recover outstanding debts, and thus has specifically entrusted your firm to publish a notice urging all debtors to prepare funds within 20 days and settle the principal and interest owed in full with your firm. Failure to do so will result in legal action. Therefore, we are publishing this notice on behalf of the representatives to inform all debtors to settle their debts within the deadline and not delay.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fall Daily After Strict Enforcement of Price Controls</h3>
<p>Speculative Merchants at a Loss, Eager to Unload. Rice Merchants Order 3,000 Tons of Foreign Rice, Deal Concluded</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council set a price limit of 21 yuan for the bean and rice market and dispatched personnel to supervise the market, prohibiting any transactions exceeding the limit, and since the rice industry associations also set standard prices for various types of rice in a joint conference, market confidence has been restored and order has returned to normal. The rice market is facing the arrival of the moldy season and strict enforcement of price controls by the authorities, leaving speculative merchants at a loss and unable to act. Many are seeking to sell, but market demand is weak, resulting in oversupply. Furthermore, due to the weather turning sunny, the market is showing a trend of more declines than rises.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning's Market</p>
<p>The market opened at 9:00 AM and closed at 12:00 PM. Thick and thin japonica rice fell by another 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, while Lu Yang Jian and Bai Yuan each fell by 0.20 yuan. The market traded approximately 5,000 dan in the morning. Rice industry experts predict that rice prices may fall further within the day. Yesterday, rice and grains transported to Shanghai by land and water routes reached approximately 5,000 to 6,000 dan. The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee will hold its 37th committee meeting at 10:00 AM today to discuss market operation policies. Furthermore, the Rice and Grain Brokers Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating: "The Municipal Council has been dispatching personnel daily to strictly supervise the rice market's price controls."</p>
<p>Strict Supervision</p>
<p>"Members of our association should absolutely comply. The association will not be responsible for any penalties incurred for transactions exceeding the limit. This has been resolved and is hereby announced." According to a rice industry leader yesterday, a small number of rice firms in the city have again entrusted the Dreyfus Company to order,</p>
<p>Saigon No. 2</p>
<p>3,000 tons of foreign rice at a price of 20.40 yuan per bag (large bag) has been concluded. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai by mid-next month. At the same time, another batch of 300 tons is under negotiation by telegram.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Increase in Staff Allowances: Two Types of Allowances, Exchange Rate and Cost of Living. Total Annual Council Expenditure Increases by Over One Hundred Thousand</h3>
<p>In February of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council approved the report of the committee on the exchange rate and cost of living allowances for the council's staff, and decided to reconsider the temporary cost of living allowances by the end of June, all of which have been announced. Since January 1st of this year, the council's "B" and "L" grade staff have each received a cost of living allowance of 15%. This allowance was considered reasonable by the aforementioned committee and was superior to the allowances provided by various organizations in the city at the time, and therefore was not changed. As for the "A" grade staff, the council had approved that they would receive an exchange rate allowance equivalent to one-third of their basic salary, and a cost of living allowance equivalent to two-thirds of their salary, the same as the "B" and "L" grade staff, as proposed by the committee.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Allowance Method Remains the Same</p>
<p>When the committee met this Monday, the allowance issue was discussed in detail. The committee members resolved to request the council to allow "A" grade staff to continue to receive the exchange rate allowance according to the original method, but to change the standard to one national currency yuan equals six British pence.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Allowance Increased Appropriately</p>
<p>Regarding the cost of living allowances for "B" and "L" grade staff (including Chinese staff holding contracts) and the allowances added to two-thirds of the salaries of "A" grade staff, the committee members resolved to request the council to approve an increase from 15% to 25%. This allowance will be re-evaluated by the end of September of this year.</p>
<p>Consider Treatment According to Needs</p>
<p>The various committees stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council cannot bear the full responsibility for the increase in the cost of living for staff, but that the staff should share the burden with the taxpayers. It is unreasonable for staff to seek economic assistance to maintain a standard of living equivalent to when the exchange rate was one shilling, two pence, and seven-eighths. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Treasurer stated that the issue of increasing cost of living allowances should be considered after clarifying the accounts for the first half of the year and the council's financial situation. However, the Civil Service Committee believes that the council should consider the treatment of staff at any time according to social conditions in order to be fair. The recent increase in the cost of living should be taken into account by the council in order to decide how to subsidize the staff.</p>
<p>Ordinary Chinese Staff All Receive Allowances</p>
<p>The Civil Service Committee also considered the issue of allowances for Chinese staff who do not hold contracts. The committee resolved to request the council to abolish the current grading method. All staff in this category whose names are listed on the salary slips of various departments should be uniformly allowed to receive an allowance of 20%. This allowance should also be re-evaluated by the end of September of this year.</p>
<p>Annual Expenditure of Over One Million</p>
<p>According to the Treasurer's estimate, the proposed additional exchange rate and cost of living allowances, based on an exchange rate of six and a half pence instead of eight pence, will require a total annual expenditure of 1,192,700 national currency yuan. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Exchange rate allowance for "A" grade staff (assuming an exchange rate of six and a half pence)</p>
<p>235,000 yuan</p>
<p>Cost of living allowance (16.67% of basic salary)</p>
<p>113,000 yuan</p>
<p>Cost of living allowance for "B" and "L" grade staff</p>
<p>Foreign staff 350,400 yuan</p>
<p>Chinese staff 53,000 yuan Cost of living allowance for Chinese staff not holding contracts 441,300 yuan</p>
<p>The above estimated expenditure accounts for one-sixteenth of the total municipal rates and land tax. If the exchange rate allowance standard is not reduced below seven pence, the recent exchange rate fluctuations will increase the annual exchange rate allowance by 123,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above recommendations have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's regular meeting on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper in Chinese Warned for Misusing Reuters' Name: "New Shen Bao" Fabricates Reuters Telegram Containing Messages Detrimental to Sino-British Relations, Receives Warning from Shanghai Japanese Consul General After Negotiations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 28th: The Japanese-owned Chinese newspaper "New Shen Bao" published in Shanghai, on the first page of its April 22nd edition, published a telegram purportedly from Reuters, citing a Chongqing dispatch date and stating that Reuters' Chongqing correspondent claimed, "Internal conflicts within the current Kuomintang government are deepening." The British Ambassador "received instructions from the British government and went to Chongqing in April to warn the Kuomintang government in good faith to begin peace talks with Japan," and so on. Upon investigation, Reuters in Chongqing or other locations</p>
<p>Did Not Send</p>
<p>This kind of news. Reuters immediately presented the matter to the Shanghai Central Consul General's Office for handling. According to a notification from the British Consul General's Office to Reuters, the matter has been submitted to the Japanese Consul General's Office, requesting that it take necessary steps without delay to prevent the "New Shen Bao" from misusing Reuters' name again and should order the "New Shen Bao" to</p>
<p>Publish a Correction</p>
<p>Explaining that the message was not issued by Reuters. As a result of this request, the Japanese Consul General's Office has recently notified the British Consul General that, after receiving the document and requesting attention to the "New Shen Bao"'s misuse of Reuters' name,</p>
<p>Immediate Warning</p>
<p>"New Shen Bao" must not repeat this act. However, the Japanese Consul General's Office's reply did not mention the "New Shen Bao"'s publication of a correction. The British Consul General's Office is continuing to negotiate with the Japanese Consul General on this matter. (Reuters note: Subscribers to our agency's telegrams must be concerned about our agency's reputation. At the same time, our agency would like to take this opportunity to notify subscribers that we will continue to protect Reuters' reputation in every possible way and prevent misuse.)</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tram Fares to Increase Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Tram Company's fare increase issue has been investigated and considered by the Municipal Council for a long time and is now approved. The company has now decided that starting tomorrow (29th), all trams and trolleybuses operating in the Public Concession will uniformly increase fares by 16.6%, meaning that the previous five-cent fare will become six cents after the increase, and fares above one dime will increase by two cents. The revised fare schedule will be announced tomorrow. It is not known whether the French Concession trams will increase fares at the same time. The Shanghai Public Concession Tram Company's announcement is recorded below: "Shanghai Tram (Public Concession) Company Limited Announcement: Due to the decline in exchange rates and large expenditures, the company's revised fare schedule has been approved by the Municipal Council and will be implemented from June 29, 1939. The revised fare schedule is displayed inside the trams and trolleybuses. This is an announcement."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden to Retire, Resigning from Office Next Month and Practicing Law in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that it was announced yesterday (27th) that Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden, who has served for ten years, will resign at the end of this month. From July 1st, he will join the well-known local law firm of Fessenden, Holcomb &amp; Harrington at 149 Yuanmingyuan Road to practice law.

<h3>Foreigner Arriving in Shanghai Describes Intense Anti-British Sentiment in Qingdao: "Down with Britain" Slogans Posted All Over the Walls of the British Consulate</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that a foreigner who arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday (27th) told reporters that anti-British sentiment in Qingdao is extremely intense. Posters in English, Chinese, and Russian are posted all over the walls of the British Consulate General and British shops. One day, "Down with Britain" slogans were posted everywhere in the city, reading "Crushing British power in China is a blessing for the Chinese people," "Britain must immediately stop assisting the Chiang government," "China must reject British capital," and other similar slogans. There were also anti-British demonstrations starting from Qingdao Third Park, proceeding along Hunan Road, and passing through Shandong Road, passing by the British Consulate General. According to local Japanese and German commercial foreign newspapers, this demonstration was "an expression of the spontaneous feelings of the people." The procession was composed of 500 students and anti-communist White Russians, disbanding outside the Japanese Consulate General. The procession carried the five-color flag of the Japanese puppet regime and banners with the words "Down with Britain" prominently displayed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Business Community to Establish Petroleum Business Promotion Association: Study and Develop Inland Petroleum Business, Solve Industrial and Transportation Fuel Problems</h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, developing inland industries and fighting the military war in the front have become equally important. The National Government and the business community are paying attention to it. It is heard that some people in the Shanghai business community, in view of the fact that petroleum is the main product used for national defense, transportation, and industry, and that failure to achieve self-sufficiency results in significant losses, and that inland provinces such as Sichuan, Xikang, Gansu, and Xinjiang all have this oil production, it is believed that if the chemical experiment is added, it will be effective and greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the China Petroleum Business Promotion Association is preparing to be established to gather comrades to engage in petroleum research. They are currently seeking founders and sponsors in order to be established as soon as possible. It is learned that the steps they are taking are to start with investigation and research. After this preliminary work is completed, they will advise the government to engage in large-scale mining, or to raise shares to organize a private petroleum company to assist the government in solving the fuel problems of various heavy industries and transportation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Domestic Economy Has Reached the Point of Exhaustion: Naginata Blades and Pen Nibs are Melted to Make Munitions, Tokyo Has Presented an Unstable Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Tak Sun West reported that, after nearly two years of Japanese military operations against China, it is now commonplace to see that Japan's economy and finances are about to reach their limits. This situation has suddenly become intense. Japan's lack of money and materials has been around for a long time. This seems to be a normal economic contraction during a country's war and is not surprising at first, but today, every economic barometer in Japan has shown a danger signal. Therefore, neutral observers believe that Japan is now cautiously seeking a solution to the so-called China Incident through a third country. Today's Japan's</p>
<p>Internal Situation</p>
<p>Is roughly as follows: (1) Food. The government now issues milk, white pagoda oil, eggs, and other essential foods according to the population. A California lemon in the United States costs three corners of foreign currency, but even at this price, it cannot be purchased. The total average consumption of food has risen by 13% in one year, and has risen by 23% compared with the time when the military war was launched on July 7th of the previous year. (2) Materials. Old Naginata blades and used pen nibs are all melted for the manufacture of munitions. Thousands of boiler manhole covers have been replaced by wooden ones.</p>
<p>Retail Market</p>
<p>Cotton and wool fabrics have disappeared. Attempts to use vegetable fiber as a substitute have not been successful. (3) Commerce. The profits of the geisha industry are very small. Banks have been ordered to reduce the interest rate on loans to small businesses. Price controls without wage controls have forced many small businesses into bankruptcy and have organized special agencies to help small businesses change careers. (4) Finance. The Japanese yen has recently fallen to</p>
<p>Unprecedented Low Prices</p>
<p>In the nearest foreign exchange market, Shanghai. Compulsory registration of gold objects is now beginning. Companies use public bonds with low face value instead of cash to issue allowances. The Ministry of Finance recently expressed "disappointment" with the mining situation in 1938. In April, Japan did not buy even one cent of war materials from the United States. All of these have produced two significant facts: one is that Japan's foreign exchange reserves have finally fallen to the lowest number, and the most severe measures have been taken to make it fundamentally</p>
<p>Impossible to Flow Out</p>
<p>One is that inflationary conditions have been brewing in Japan. Japan's wartime problem is a fundamental difficulty. Japan lacks resources that are vital to its survival, so it must rely on foreign countries for oil, iron, coal, cotton, wool, pulp, and chemicals. Japan almost entirely needs to purchase these items with hard cash and ship them back on its own ships. The number of purchases has been huge and has been going on for almost two years. As for other countries lending credit to Japan,</p>
<p>The Number Is Very Small</p>
<p>Merchants from all countries must obtain cash before they can let ships carry goods to Japan. When the fiscal year ended on March 31, although the daily bureau kept strict secrets, the public knew that the financial community was about to panic about the lack of foreign currencies and gold at home and abroad. Regarding the amount of gold produced in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan in 1938, no numbers are ever announced, so</p>
<p>It is impossible to know for sure</p>
<p>It is estimated that its annual output is around 6,500 yuan, but given Finance Minister Ishiwatari's disappointment with gold production, the financial community still doubts whether last year's gold production reached this number. Official statistics show that Japan's exports of gold to the United States in 1938 were 32% lower than in 1937. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Health Movement Propaganda Week Extended for Ten Days, Also Contacting Concession Authorities for Cooperation</h3>
<p>In order to promote the health of citizens, the Shanghai Youth Association launched a health movement propaganda week, originally scheduled from July 1st to 7th, to carry out expanded publicity in all districts of the city. Due to insufficient preparations, it has been decided to postpone it to July 10th to 16th. They are now engaged in drawing various charts, hiring doctors as judges for children's health competitions, and on the one hand, contacting the concession health department for cooperation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Zhejiang Postal Delivery Studying New Routes: Last Mail to Be Loaded on Moufu</h3>
<p>Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang postal delivery is now watching whether this morning's Moufu wheel can drive to Yong. If it does, the post office will be able to load the last batch of mail and transport it to Zhejiang, and then it will be suspended temporarily. However, the post office is now taking other routes that can connect to eastern Zhejiang and are more time-saving in order to facilitate the public.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Levies Property Tax, Residents Must Submit Payment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council has issued an announcement regarding the collection of property tax, saying: For the purpose of announcement, notice is hereby given that the property tax for various Chinese and foreign houses for the quarter ending September 30, 1939, is due on July 1, 1939. All taxpayers are requested to note that the property tax for all Western-style houses should be delivered to the Bureau's Tax and Revenue Department at 209 Jiangxi Road by all residents upon receipt of the notice of payment of tax. The Bureau will not send personnel to collect it. This is a special announcement for general knowledge. This is an announcement by General Manager Philip Felliper.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Issues New Penalties, Attempting to Prevent Roaming Japanese Nationals in China from Engaging in Various Activities within Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that, according to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese Consulate General has recently issued new penalties aimed at punishing those base Japanese individuals who, taking advantage of the current situation, act with a "degree that hinders Sino-Japanese harmony." These individuals may face expulsion from China. This new directive was jointly drafted by the Japanese Army, Navy, and consular authorities, with the aim of addressing Japanese individuals who possess nothing of value beyond themselves and engage in various activities within occupied areas, causing Chinese people to harbor ill feelings towards the Japanese. Such situations have occurred repeatedly, and the consulate has taken notice. However, there were no specific laws in place to address this behavior, preventing action from being taken. Japanese nationals seeking to come to China are now required to obtain permission, which has reduced the number of undesirable elements. Nevertheless, a small number of such individuals have still managed to enter China.</p>

<h3>Russian Police Officer Dies in Torrential Rain After Being Shot; Political Case, Bullet Fired from Occupied Area near Xujiahui Tushanwan, Strikes Vital Point</h3>
<p>Russian police officer Kotov (transliteration), number 49 of the White Russian squad of the French police force, was dispatched at 11:40 PM the night before last (the 28th) to patrol with a Chinese police officer near the iron wire barricades erected by the French garrison in the vicinity of the Panjiazhai area of Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai West. At the time, it was raining heavily. Fearing that criminals might be lurking, the officer used a flashlight to search the surrounding area in the darkness. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew from the Chinese area of the occupied zone to the south, striking the Russian officer's arm and piercing his chest. He fell to the ground, wounded. He immediately ordered the accompanying Chinese officer to fire back towards the south, firing four shots. The other side also returned fire with three shots, but both sides were in darkness, and neither hit their target. The Chinese officer ran back to the temporary office of the French police station in Xujiahui to report the incident. The police station dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate and urgently sent an ambulance to transport the wounded Kotov, number 49, to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died en route from excessive blood loss. His body was then transferred to the Westerners' autopsy facility attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour. At noon yesterday, Inspector Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, along with a forensic doctor, arrived to examine the body and confirmed that the death was due to a gunshot wound. The body was handled for funeral arrangements and burial by the relevant authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The French police authorities are taking the case very seriously and are currently conducting an investigation.</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports (excerpt above): The French Concession police are currently examining the bullet that killed Kotov. Currently, the prevailing opinion is that the bullet was fired from a Japanese soldier's rifle, but it may not be possible to prove that the shooter was indeed a Japanese soldier, as Japanese soldiers' rifles are quite often in the hands of non-Japanese, most likely guerrillas. Detectives are also working diligently to investigate the trajectory of the bullet from the other side of the river in order to determine the firing location. However, as of this afternoon (the 28th), the investigation has not reached a stage where a conclusive statement can be made. Kotov was only 25 years old and was previously a barber. He had only been with the White Russian squad of the French Concession police for four and a half months. Several of his relatives currently reside in Harbin.</p>
<h3>Sailboat Loaded with Lumber Completely Destroyed by Fire; Ship Owner Demands Compensation from Cargo Owner, Negotiations Between Both Parties Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement</h3>
<p>The Xiehe Yongji Sailing Vessel Company on Xinqiao Street, Bao'an Lane, through the introduction of Li Henian of the Senrun Lumber Company on Xin Dagulu, was entrusted by Wu Fuqin, the owner of the Qilin Yinxiangtai Lumber Company in Haimen, to transport a load of lumber purchased in Shanghai. The lumber was to be shipped from Yangshupu to the new port of Haimen, where it would be unloaded. Both parties agreed on the freight charges and waterway fees and stipulated in the contract that the goods would be unloaded upon arrival at the port. The Xiehe Yongji Vessel Company then dispatched the Yonglu sailing vessel to transport the lumber. On the 18th of the same month, the vessel arrived at the new port, and the Xiangtai Lumber Company sent personnel to order the Yonglu sailing vessel to enter half a li into the new port to dock and unload two-thirds of the cargo. Unfortunately, the guerrilla forces and Japanese troops engaged in a battle in the area, and it was also low tide, with shallow water in the harbor. As a result, the Yonglu vessel was unable to sail out to avoid the conflict and was set ablaze by the troops, resulting in the complete destruction of the cargo and the vessel, leaving only the hull. The vessel owner, Xiehe Yongji Company, claims that this damage was due to the cargo owner, Xiangtai Lumber Company, violating the contract by ordering the vessel to enter the port to unload the goods, making it impossible to avoid the disaster. They are demanding compensation from the cargo owner for the loss of the vessel. The Xiangtai Lumber Company is only willing to cover the two hundred yuan in travel expenses for disbanding the ship's captain and crew and sending them back to their hometowns. The vessel owner believes that the cargo owner lacks sincerity in providing compensation and that the amount offered is far too low. Therefore, they have engaged a lawyer to send a letter to Wu Fuqin and Li Henian of the Xiangtai and Senrun Lumber Companies, respectively, demanding joint and several compensation for the loss of the vessel. The two parties have exchanged letters and arguments, engaging in a heated written battle, with no resolution reached. It is inevitable that the matter will be taken to court. This is yet another dispute caused by the war.</p>
<h3>Letter to French Newspaper Calls for Strict Crackdown on Rent Increases; Hopeful the Concession Authorities will Take Notice</h3>
<p>Translated by Shanghai Guangshe on the 28th, as reported in the French-language *Journal de Shanghai*, a person signing as C. G. F. D. submitted a letter to this newspaper (referring to the French-language newspaper) stating that since Shanghai suffered from the war, a speculative business of key money for old houses and opening fees for new houses has emerged due to the difficulty of finding housing. If this were in Europe, the government would have severely cracked down on it long ago. It is now heard that some people have specially formed companies to engage in this kind of speculative business to exploit the people and cooperate with major landlords and accountants to jointly make this unjust fortune. In Hong Kong, the local authorities have strictly cracked down on housing rent incidents, so fortunately, peace is maintained. So why doesn't the Shanghai French Concession authorities also issue laws to restrict this kind of speculation? Therefore, we hope that the French authorities stationed in Shanghai will, in accordance with the spirit of Shanghai's previous crackdown on high rents, strictly prohibit landlords from evicting tenants or forcing rent increases. As for key money and opening fees, they should be prosecuted for the crime of obtaining money by fraud, and residents will often receive great benefits, it is said.</p>
<h3>Demolition of Lean-To Structures in Xujiahui Nearly Leads to Market Strike</h3>
<p>The Li Chongjing River channel in Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, has been in disrepair for many years, and siltation has become increasingly severe. Now, the French Municipal Council is using garbage to fill the river in order to build a road to facilitate traffic. The houses along the river on the east bank, from No. 2190 Haig Road to the Su Xin Bookstore at the intersection of Hongqiao Road, No. 1986, are arranged closely together and face Haig Road. The businesses that have opened after the war have developed abnormally. However, each house has built lean-to structures over the river behind the house for many years. Now, the French Municipal Council, because it obstructs the road, has notified the shops along the river through the police station to demolish the above-mentioned lean-to structures automatically. The stores then publicly elected Zhou Chengxiang, the former chairman of the town's Commercial Association, to request the French authorities to postpone the demolition. Unexpectedly, at about 4 PM yesterday afternoon, Chinese and Western police officers suddenly arrived at the scene and ordered laborers to forcibly demolish the lean-to structures along the river that were obstructing the road. This aroused public outrage, and a large crowd gathered, resulting in a market strike. Dozens of stores, including Xianghe Yarn Store, Da Zhonghua Overshoes Store, Zhu Yongchang Meat Shop, Yitai Meat Shop, Wanhe Ham Store, Yitaifeng Grocery Store, Yongan Foreign Goods Store, Yuankang Clothing Store, Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Store, Lu Gaojian, Shen Shunxing Hardware Store, Heji Meat Shop, and Shenghe Xin Tin Foil Store, temporarily closed their doors and suspended business. Fortunately, Chairman Zhou Chengxiang learned of this and rushed to the scene to persuade them and explained the benefits and harms. The stores then opened their doors and resumed business as usual. The temporary office of the Refugee District of the French Police Station (at the Song Family Cemetery in Tangjiexi) learned of this and ordered the stores to go there for questioning at 9:30 AM this morning.</p>
<p>French Police Auction of Used Goods</p>
<p>On Saturday, July 1, 1939, at 3:00 PM, an auction of used shoes, clothing, broken iron tires, bicycles, rickshaws, and handcarts will be held at No. 28 Xuehuali Road.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Relatives Living Together; Doctor Accuses Lawyer of Encroachment; Dispute Over Telephone, Admonishing Both Parties to Settle Out of Court</h3>
<p>Shao Jingkang, a native of Nanhui who practices law in Shanghai, resides at No. 3 Huayuanfang, Jinshenfu Road. He is now being sued by Yu Xiangzhou, a fellow villager who is a Chinese medicine practitioner specializing in pediatrics, who also lives in the same residence. Yu Xiangzhou has engaged lawyer Li Weibin to represent him in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, suing Shao Jingkang for encroachment on telephone services and obstruction of freedom. According to the claim, the house in which they reside originally belonged to the plaintiff's son. The defendant is a relative. Last year, the plaintiff's son transferred the house to the defendant. The plaintiff lives upstairs, while the plaintiff rents the downstairs living room as a clinic and the servants' quarters for accommodation. Due to the needs of medical practice, the plaintiff, in his own name, installed</p>
<p>A telephone</p>
<p>With the number 77505, which was installed in the living room. However, after the defendant moved in, he suddenly transferred the telephone account and changed the account name to the defendant's name. After the Bureau notified the plaintiff, the defendant discussed the matter with him because he needed a telephone for his legal practice. After an agreement was reached to register with the Bureau in both parties' names, the defendant suddenly disconnected the telephone and installed it upstairs, preventing the plaintiff from using it. Moreover, when someone called to ask the plaintiff to see a doctor, the defendant would reject them on the phone, saying he didn't know or that the person wasn't there. These actions by the defendant constitute encroachment on telephone services and obstruction of freedom.</p>
<p>Request for investigation</p>
<p>Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, summoned the plaintiff and his lawyer to court yesterday morning to hear the case. The defendant did not appear but sent lawyer Chen Zhen to defend him, stating that the plaintiff and defendant were originally relatives. Since the defendant inherited the house, the telephone is an accessory to the house and he naturally has the right to dispose of it. It cannot be regarded as encroachment on telephone services or obstruction of freedom. He requested that the defendant be declared innocent. After reviewing the statements in court, it was determined that since both parties were relatives, they should settle out of court. The hearing was rescheduled for July 13.</p>
<h3>Falsely Established Film Company, Defrauded Money, Two Offenders Detained and Interrogated</h3>
<p>Chen Bin, a native of Shaoxing, 29 years old this year, was formerly an actor in the Yihua and Yueming film companies. He currently lives at No. 10 Hongqing Lane, Lane 140, Xinzha Road. Zhu Weikang, a native of Anhui who works in the same industry as Chen, is 23 years old this year and currently lives with Chen in the same residence. Last year, Chen and Zhu rented Room 40 on the fourth floor of No. 25 Fada Road to establish the New Century Film Company. Chen served as director and Zhu as screenwriter and posted advertisements to recruit male and female actors. They charged a small registration fee of two yuan and a handling fee of five yuan. Upon signing a contract to perform in a play and film, the salary ranged from 50 to 100 yuan. At that time, more than 30 young men and women went to register and audition, paying a total of more than 200 yuan in fees. It was only recently discovered that Chen and others had set up a scam and reported it to the French police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Chen Bin and Zhu Weikang one after another. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special District Court, requesting custody for investigation and rescheduling the hearing. Subsequently, the victims, including Zhou Chunying, Xu Zhiqing, Wang He, Xiang Ming, and Zhang Yingying (female), recounted their experiences of being defrauded. When questioned, Chen's confession was vague, while Zhu confessed that Chen initiated the establishment of the film company, and the money collected was spent in dance halls and gambling dens. It was originally planned to shoot films such as *The Sound of Thunder and the Shadow of a Ghost*, *The Three Musketeers*, *Inseparable Brothers*, *Sea Hero*, and *Killing the Thief and Revenge*, but they were shelved due to lack of funds. The judge instructed to verify the confessions, and the hearing was rescheduled to July 5. The defendants were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Owner of Daxin Woolen Goods Store Accused of Adultery; Affair Discovered by Wife Who Files Complaint; Defendant Claims Plaintiff Agreed, Ordered Defendant to Provide Evidence for Further Verification</h3>
<p>Yao Wei寰, a native of Zhenjiang, 35 years old, formerly jointly opened the Dun Kang Woolen Goods Store, and now opens the Da Xin Woolen Goods Store at No. 5 Sassoon Li, Shandong Road, living a relatively wealthy life. Yao married Zhou Rongzhen, a woman from his hometown, in Zhenjiang in 1925. After the marriage, Yao came to Shanghai to do business, while Zhou managed the household affairs in his hometown. They have had</p>
<p>Eight children</p>
<p>Together, but five of them have died early. The remaining children are one son and two daughters. The eldest son is 13 years old, and the second daughter is 8 years old. Zhou is originally a village woman who rarely comes to Shanghai. Recently, because the countryside has been unstable, she came to Shanghai with her children in early spring and lived in the Daxin store. Unexpectedly, she heard rumors that her husband had an affair in Shanghai, so she questioned her husband, which angered Yao, who cut off her living expenses. Zhou became suspicious and investigated in detail.</p>
<p>Recently Discovered</p>
<p>That Yao was living with Tang Guizhen (30 years old), a woman from Yangzhou, in the back building of No. 422 Guangdong Road. Therefore, she reported it to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Li Pengfei, he requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant and rushed to search the premises at 7:30 AM on the 18th of the month. Yao and Tang were arrested on the spot and taken back to the police station. Since Yao and others have established businesses and residences, they were not detained. Instead, they were brought to the First Special District Court,</p>
<p>Issue a summons</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Yao and Tang were summoned to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special District Court. Yao and others jointly engaged lawyer Jin Ximin to defend them. Judge Meng Tingke opened the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu clarified the facts and prosecuted the case based on Article 239 of the Criminal Law, requesting the court to punish them according to the law. Yao Wei寰's defense was that he has been living with Tang for six years and has had two children with her. This matter was done with the plaintiff's consent, and</p>
<p>Each time she has come to Shanghai</p>
<p>She has lived with Tang. The current incident occurred because the plaintiff's father has repeatedly been involved in lawsuits with me over money disputes, and that caused this incident. Judge Meng verified the confessions and instructed to change the date of the case and ordered the police to conduct a detailed investigation and ordered the defendant to provide evidence that the plaintiff had prior knowledge of the matter for further verification.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhou Abuses Maid; Sentenced and Suspended</h3>
<p>Wu Zhou (28 years old), a woman from Hunan, lives at No. 20 Kangle Lane, Kangnaide Road. Four years ago, she paid eight yuan to buy Wu Hongmei, a fellow villager who is now 16 years old, as a maid. Recently, because the maid was careless in her work, she was beaten by her with a bamboo ruler, leaving her with injuries all over her body. At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, she was beaten severely with a bamboo ruler again for not washing clothes cleanly, causing serious injuries to her left leg, kidney, and head. Her anger was still not appeased, so she went out and wandered on the road. At about 6:00 PM, she was accompanied by someone to report to the Geding Road Police Station. Detective Li Huaguo was dispatched to investigate at the address and found the report to be true. Wu Zhou was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for the crime of abuse under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. According to the maid Wu Hongmei's testimony, she did not want to go home with her again. Judge Huang Risheng interrogated Wu Zhou and sentenced her to six months in prison, suspended for two years. Wu Hongmei was temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care.</p>
<h3>Explosion of Bomb in Xiyuansi Branch Temple Kills Incense Keeper; Drug Use at Midnight Leads to Disaster, Loud Explosion Injures Two Monks</h3>
<p>Zhou Huichang (44 years old), an incense keeper from Yancheng, who lived upstairs in the Xiyuansi Branch Temple at No. 476 Avenue Edward VII, had been employed for seven years. The abbot, Yi Yingzeng, provided him with a monthly allowance of ten yuan in addition to a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Zhou was addicted to drugs and only went to bed after midnight every day. At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhou, as usual, smoked opium and lay on the bed, adding strong tea and cigarettes to his enjoyment. After a while, he got up and played with a small hand grenade (during the Shanghai war, the temple set up a refugee shelter, housing more than 400 male and female refugees for half a year. The hand grenade may have been picked up by a refugee in the war zone and left in the temple, eventually falling into Zhou's hands, who treasured it like a jewel). Unexpectedly, he accidentally touched the firing pin, and it exploded with a loud bang, injuring Zhou's head, left cheek, and both hands. His brains splattered, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. He immediately fainted on the floor. A room was also blown up. At the same time, it was raining heavily. Two monks, Ping Jing and Zhi An, who lived in the next room, were awakened from their sleep by the shock. Mistaking it for a thunderous explosion, they desperately jumped out of the window and fell on the roof of a low building in the alley, injuring their hands and feet. They were later discovered and reported to the police station, who summoned an ambulance to rush them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, Zhou died shortly after due to his severe injuries. The injuries of the two monks were minor, and they were later declared unharmed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the public concession of Avenue Edward VII, Chengdu Road, west side of 476 Suzhou Xiyuansi Branch Temple, yesterday morning (28th) at 1:30 AM, a bomb exploded and killed a person. Here are the details of the investigation:</p>
<p>The History of the Xiyuansi Branch Temple</p>
<p>Xiyuansi is originally a famous ancient temple in Suzhou. The abbot's name is Long An. In 1921, he rented a large building at No. 476 Avenue Edward VII in the public concession (three bays, two wings, and three courtyards, totaling ten buildings) and established the Shanghai Branch Temple of Suzhou Xiyuansi. He sent monk Yin Zhen as the abbot. There were thirty to forty guest monks. The incense keeper was Ji Weizhang (44 years old, from Yancheng), who was an old incense keeper of Suzhou Xiyuansi and was transferred to Shanghai by monk Yin Zhen. Ji's two sons, the eldest named Guisheng and the younger named Liansheng, both worked as tea boys in the branch temple. Usually, there were many sutra recitations. After the 813 Shanghai War, the abbot Yi Yin's income sharply decreased and he was unable to maintain it. Therefore, he rented all the houses of the branch temple to refugees who came to Shanghai from the mainland to take refuge, renting to more than 40 families, and the monthly rent income was considerable, which he used to support the temple. Later, because the city became safe, the population of the concession increased sharply, and commerce developed abnormally, and Buddhist affairs gradually improved. The abbot then issued an order to evict the guests. However, most of the tenants had difficulty finding houses and delayed moving. After the abbot tried every means, he only moved out two-thirds of the tenants, and more than a dozen tenants have not moved out to this day.</p>
<p>Bomb Explodes, Killing Incense Keeper</p>
<p>The bedroom of Ji Weizhang, the incense keeper of the branch temple, was in the rear room of the west wing of the second courtyard. He lived there alone. Ji's two sons lived downstairs. Last night (27th), Ji entered the room to sleep at about 10:00 PM. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 AM yesterday morning, a loud noise occurred in Ji's room. All the monks and laymen in the temple were awakened from their sleep. At that time, it was raining heavily. They rushed to Ji's bedroom to check and saw that both of Ji's hands had been blown off, and his body had been blown up. The flesh on his head and face had been blown off. Blood and flesh were blurred, a tragic scene. He had already died. The walls were also blown down. Ji's body was pressed under the bricks and tiles.</p>
<p>Report to Police Station, Body Dug Out</p>
<p>Abbot Yin Zhen checked and realized that it was a bomb explosion, and immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief immediately led a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene and dug out Ji's body from the rubble and sent it to the morgue for autopsy. They also found pieces of foreign silver skin that looked like cigarette cans in the house. In addition to checking the front and back houses of the branch temple, they also sent one Chinese and one Indian policeman each to guard the temple. Unexpectedly, at 11:15 AM yesterday (28th), another loud noise occurred in the front half of the west wing of the second courtyard of the branch temple (which was an empty house and no one lived in). The lime on the walls was scattered all over the ground. Because no one lived there, no one was injured, only the tables, chairs, and decorations were damaged.</p>
<p>Detectives Search and Detain Several People</p>
<p>The stationed police officer went to the police station to report again. The police chief immediately dispatched more than 30 detectives at 3:15 PM and rushed to the scene. They monitored the actions of all the monks and laymen in the branch temple, searched the tenants and monks' houses upstairs and downstairs, and after detailed interrogation, they saw that the Qiao couple, tenants who lived in the west wing of the front courtyard, and several monks were suspicious and brought them all to the police station for verification.</p>
<h3>Maid, Unable to Endure Abuse, Commits Suicide by Poisoning; Claims Master Swallowed Up Accumulated Wages of 600 Yuan; Unable to Endure Oppression, Hope Society Will Act Righteously to Redress Grievance</h3>
<p>Xu Wu, a woman from Ganpu, Zhejiang, also known as A'yu, 31 years old this year, her husband has passed away, and she has been widowed for eight years. After her husband's death, she came to Shanghai to work as a maid at the home of Wang Shenfu, the owner of Zhaotai Foreign Goods Store at No. 63 Dongqipan Street, Henan Road, British Concession, for seven years. Suddenly, on the morning of the 23rd, she went to the Asia Hotel at No. 135 Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, to rent Room 311. She suddenly had a pessimistic view and, on the night of the 24th, in the hotel,</p>
<p>Committed suicide by poisoning</p>
<p>At 6:30 AM the next morning, the tea boy discovered it, entered the room to check, and found that she had committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. He immediately informed the accountant, who reported it to the French Police Station. A detective was dispatched to investigate and found two pieces of paper on her body: a suicide note and a complaint. One paper stated that she had worked as a maid at Wang Shenfu's house for seven years and had accumulated wages of 600 yuan, which were stored with the master and not allowed to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Has Been Swallowed</p>
<p>The master was picky about her daily work and often abused her. It also said that the master was selling inferior goods and, after closing the doors tightly at night, he changed the inferior goods for domestic brands and sold them mixed together, making profits of hundreds of thousands, regardless of the hardship of the servants, and swallowing their hard-earned money. Unable to endure the oppression, she committed suicide, hoping that benevolent gentlemen would act righteously to redress her grievance. The other paper stated that the master's nephew, Song Renqing, borrowed 20 yuan from her,</p>
<p>Repeatedly Asked but Not Returned</p>
<p>Instead, she was insulted and scolded. Helpless, she spent eight yuan to entrust Zhang Fushun, a colleague in the store, to buy sleeping pills to commit suicide, which had nothing to do with the pharmacy. The detective took this complaint back to the police station for record. However, after Wu entered the hospital, she was deeply poisoned and the treatment was ineffective. She died at 9:00 AM on the 27th. The police station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. Yesterday, Inspector Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court and a forensic doctor were reported to have visited the hall,</p>
<p>Verified the Deceased</p>
<p>It was confirmed that she died from poisoning. Because there were no relatives, the detective reported the investigation situation and submitted the suicide note. The official ordered the body to be taken by the Charity Hall for burial, awaiting family recognition. The two suicide notes were taken back to the police station by the detective for investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Gong Hongzhao Convicted in Adultery Case Dies of Kidney Disease</h3>
<p>Gong Hongzhao, a native of Chongming, 29 years old, former principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, chairman of Boji Pawnshop, and member of the Shanghai Bar Association, already had a wife, Gu, and children. In July of last year, he became entangled with Shen Yaoying, the eldest daughter of Shen Zhujiu, a wealthy merchant from Chongming (27 years old this year, having studied at Guanghua University). The two lived together at No. 6 Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road. Shen Zhujiu then engaged two lawyers, Ge Zhijun and Yu Chengxiu, to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing him of inciting Shen Yaoying to steal 40 gold pounds, 300 yuan in cash, and gold bracelets, and accusing Gong of defamation. Gong was sentenced to three months in prison in the first instance. Gong refused to accept the sentence and engaged lawyer Xue Dubi to appeal to the High Court Third Branch, but the appeal was rejected. The sentence was allowed to be commuted to a fine, which Gong paid. Recently, he suddenly fell ill with kidney disease and died a few days ago due to ineffective treatment.</p>

<h3>The Latest on Vitamin E</h3>
<p>— Ming Chu</p>
<p>Doctors and chemists from around the world recently gathered in London to discuss the latest vitamin - Vitamin E. This vitamin can be extracted from wheat germ and cottonseed, and it can now be manufactured in the laboratory by combining various ingredients.</p>
<p>According to Dr. MacDonald of Jessop Women's Hospital in the UK, eighteen women, before being treated with Vitamin E, had a total of fifty-three pregnancies, but only five of the babies were born alive. Since taking Vitamin E, they have given birth to seventeen live babies.</p>
<p>Other scientists also expressed their belief that in normal pregnancies, it is absolutely essential for the mother's diet to contain sufficient Vitamin E. They also cited examples of women who had been unhappy because their babies had never been born alive, and many had become mothers after taking Vitamin E.</p>
<p>Dr. Moller of Copenhagen said that Vitamin E treatment for habitual abortion is successful in 75 to 80 out of 100 cases. Dr. Moller also said that this new vitamin is also beneficial to farmers, as 75 percent of cows that previously did not produce calves had satisfactory results with Vitamin E treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, new discoveries have been announced that Vitamin E seems to not only affect fertility but also promote development.</p>
<h3>Talking About Clothes in the Plum Rain Season</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>The cries of "Sugar Plum" in every yamen seem to have gradually subsided. Indeed, time passes quickly. The green plums that were not picked and mixed with sugar have already taken on a reddish-brown coat. The plums are yellow, and the plum rain season is here again!</p>
<p>Speaking of the plum rain, it's really a headache. It rains all day, and the sky is full of water vapor. Other things don't matter, but I'm worried that some clothes will be ruined in this plum rain season. The plum rain is a good opportunity for pests and bacteria to breed. The winter before last, there were holes in my clothes without me even knowing it. Last year, I had to buy new clothes again. I hate these pests that invade my clothes, these pests that hurt my finances. If I don't catch them, kill them, and get rid of them, it's terrible. Money flows out, and my clothes are always a mess. They're broken here and patched there. How can I talk about neatness?</p>
<p>Clothes are mostly made of fiber. Wool clothing is made of protein, which is exactly what pests like to eat. The rest, like velvet clothing, are also weak and have no resistance, so they are inevitably eaten by pests. Although many clothes are specially processed to prevent pests, they are too expensive to meet the needs of the general public.</p>
<p>Clothes made of cotton, linen, and rayon are not as susceptible to pests as wool. Silk is also better than wool, but it is still susceptible to damage during the plum rain season.</p>
<p>Wool clothing pests hatch into larvae in the summer. These larvae damage clothes in the winter, and then turn into pupae or moths in the spring and summer. Moths and beetles lay eggs again. Therefore, our wool clothes are a good place for these pests to breed endlessly. We must completely eliminate them. This plum rain season is the best time to do it. We can't delay any longer!</p>
<p>Washing, ironing, and drying are three ways to kill most of the larvae. The best method is refrigeration. Some people use mothballs or volatile oils to prevent pests, or even try to kill them, but this is impossible.</p>
<p>The plum rain season is the most active time for microbes. Scientists have tested that in the Jiangnan region, when the plum blossoms are in bloom, the humidity is 75% and the temperature is 20-30 degrees, which is ideal for mold growth. To prevent mold, we must pay attention to: remove stains from clothes; store clothes in a low-temperature place, but keep it dry; seal the clothes. The easiest way is to clean the clothes and store them in a dry place.</p>
<h3>A Week's Worth of Economical Recipes</h3>
<p>— Hua Ying Nv Shi</p>
<p>Eels have been on the market for a while, and the price has not been too expensive lately. My economical recipes should include them too. Eels look like snakes, so timid people don't dare to eat them, but there are still many people who love to eat them. There are many ways to cook eels. The most common is stir-fried eel noodles. The whole eel is sliced into shreds, boned, and stir-fried with sliced broad beans. Add a little lotus root powder, and when eating, add sesame oil and pepper powder, which is very delicious. If you can't buy broad beans, you can use sliced lettuce as a substitute. It's also acceptable. Under the name of stir-fried eel paste, there are two types: stir-fried eel back, which uses only the back of the eel, sliced into shreds, and the meat is harder; and stir-fried eel slices, which is simply sliced into pieces instead of shreds. The cooking method for these two is the same as for stir-fried eel paste. In addition, the whole eel can be cut into sections and braised with pork, adding some garlic cloves. Those who like strong flavors will definitely welcome the use of sugar and soy sauce. There is also a cooking method where the eel shreds are quickly fried in hot oil and then made into soup, a great dish to eat with braised pork.</p>

<h3>Chauffeurs and Road Safety Campaign</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>It is said that recently, there have been more intersections in the concession, and pedestrians are crowded on every road. As a result, the number of car accidents causing death and injury has reached an unprecedented record in the past year. Therefore, those concerned about traffic issues have united with various sectors to hold a safety campaign. The busier the city, the more congested the traffic, and the more people killed or injured under cars, which is an unavoidable theorem. Even though European and American countries pay close attention to this issue, they cannot actually reduce the number of car accidents. In fact, in order to reduce the number of people killed or injured under cars, in addition to pedestrians being careful themselves, chauffeurs should be responsible for more than half of the safety issues.</p>
<p>After a car accident causes injury or death to pedestrians, the court has various penalties, but these are only temporary solutions and are passive in nature. In reality, they will not reduce accidents. Moreover, many chauffeurs who cause accidents have their fines paid by the car owner, so the chauffeur does not suffer any loss. As a result, the chauffeur may develop a feeling that if an accident occurs and a pedestrian is injured or killed, the most that will happen is that the owner will have to pay some money to compensate for the loss or comfort the dead. Therefore, in addition to hoping that the court will impose severe penalties on vehicles that cause accidents, the fundamental solution is to make every chauffeur understand their responsibility for road safety. As far as possible, pedestrians should not be injured or killed.</p>
<p>According to those who study safety issues, a chauffeur who wants to prevent accidents while driving should pay attention to the following ten commandments: (1) When driving a car on the road, you should always maintain control. If you suddenly see vehicles or pedestrians in front and cannot brake in time, an accident may occur. (2) You should always check whether your car has any damage or defects. (3) When the car is driving on the road, your line of sight must always be focused on the road surface. A moment of negligence can lead to a major disaster. (4) When driving a car, you should not drive onto the right-hand sidewalk unless there is a danger or it is absolutely necessary. (5) When the vehicle is moving forward, you should not drive too slowly or linger arbitrarily to block the progress of other vehicles. (6) Driving a car is like living at home. You should have a sense of humility. When there are cars driving in front of you, do not boast of your skills and try to overtake them. (7) You should know all the traffic rules in the city one by one. (8) When driving a car, if there is a problem with the parts or gasoline, you should handle it carefully and not be impatient. (9) Do not drive after drinking alcohol. (10) You should also study the local map to save driving time or avoid overly busy roads. The Shanghai Safety Campaign has begun. I dare to offer the above ten commandments to all chauffeurs in the city. Car owners who drive themselves and do not hire chauffeurs may also use these ten commandments as a reference!</p>
<p>Wanted: I would like to request a copy of my novel "Turning Point," which was published in this newspaper (during the Rotary Club period in the Republic of China's twentieth year). If anyone has a clipped copy and is willing to part with it, I am willing to exchange it for one of my books, or I can pay in cash. I am also looking for a single-volume edition of "Notes on the Japanese Sword." The method is the same as above.

<h3>Difficult to Eat</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhi</p>
<h3>The Kitchen Area</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>In Shanghai, whether it's a "one-up-one-down" or "two-up-two-down" house, there's always this kitchen area located inside the back door, next to the lower floor, behind the staircase wall. In terms of area, it can't fit two tables. As the name suggests, the kitchen area is undoubtedly where the kitchen is located. However, Shanghai is a famous "inch of gold" land, and it was difficult to find a detached house even before the war, let alone after the war when the two concessions had a population of over five million! A "one-up-one-down" house must have at least three households, usually four or five, and as many as seven or eight. A "two-up-two-down" house has twice as many. The kitchen area, like the terrace and tap water, is declared in advance by the landlord as a special public area.</p>
<p>Thus, the small kitchen area becomes a "public concession," which is very lively. There's a Cantonese stove, a coal stove, and a stove made from a kerosene tank, all lined up in a row like an "exhibition." Iron nails are hammered into the walls, with various pots of different sizes hanging on them. There are steel pots, cast iron pots, copper pots... and earthenware pots that can't hang, so they're placed on the ground, perhaps with some soup left inside. Each household's cabinet also occupies "airspace." A five-bulb electric lamp is blackened by grease and grime, like a naughty child's face. The landlord washes it once a year on "spring cleaning" day, but otherwise its "true colors" are never seen. The same is true for the glass window facing the street hall.</p>
<p>So when you walk into the kitchen area, you have to be careful with your head and feet. It's very painful to bump your forehead against the wooden leg of the cabinet. As for your feet, there are many things on the ground: coal baskets, wooden boxes, lead buckets, copper buckets, fire tongs, vegetable baskets... almost making you walk through thorns. It's not just a matter of tripping and falling; if you step on someone's old things, you'll have to pay for new ones at the original price. What's more, the kitchen floor is muddy all year round and easy to slip on. Honestly, who, except for the landlord, bothers to pay attention to whether the tap is turned off? It's a matter of public morality.</p>
<p>From 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, it is the heyday of the kitchen area. The landlord's wife or nanny, the sister-in-law from the front building, the grandma from the back building, the nanny from the small room, the older sister from the attic... all return from the vegetable market one after another and gather in the kitchen area. Then the meeting begins. Each person first reports the price of goods, then checks the items in the basket, and then evaluates them. The sister-in-law from the front building bought the yellow croaker cheaply, and the grandma from the back building bought the fresh prawns... If you want to hear an accurate report on the price fluctuations of fish, meat, and vegetables, the kitchen area will give it to you.</p>
<p>Because the kitchen area is a "public concession," some small disputes are inevitable. For example, if there's less salt in someone's salt cellar, or only the head of the ribbonfish is left in the cabinet... then there will be implied scolding, although it is baseless, just to vent the anger in their hearts. As long as everyone doesn't overthink, it's easy for things to turn into nothing. A virtuous housewife in the kitchen area will say: "Only cook the food in your own pot, don't worry about whether other people's is bland or salty," which will avoid a lot of trouble. Don't underestimate this small kitchen area. It is the source of three meals a day and also a prototype of a complex society.</p>

<h3>More on "Strategy" in the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Tu Lao</p>
<p>I still want to say a few words about "strategy" in the literary world.</p>
<p>In fact, comparing writers to lawyers is not very appropriate. Some of our writers have already surpassed lawyers in their abilities. Lawyers' "strategy" is ultimately for others, not for themselves, and the purpose is very simple, just to make a living. Writers are different. It's a personal matter, and if the "strategy" is successful, they gain both fame and fortune. This is called "the times make heroes."</p>
<p>So, judging from the "strategy" that has appeared in the literary world, not only are there many kinds, but also the patterns are constantly renewed and progressing very rapidly, even running fast with the times.</p>
<p>Self-promotion or hiring people to cheer has become too outdated. A notice or a few anonymous letters are no longer surprising. Even putting out a special issue scolding a certain celebrity in a self-run publication and then sending the publication to the scolded person to elicit a retaliatory response is something that people are tired of seeing. Thus, there are more artistic and more "spirited" "strategies" being born.</p>
<p>That "strategy" is the real strategy that surpasses the lawyer-style "strategy." It's not about giving others nicknames, but about giving oneself nicknames. The method is: to beat the drum and yell it out oneself, saying, "Look! I am an inferiority complex sufferer." Or saying, "Look! I am the nth kind of person." But just saying it is not enough. Then you must perform a little. If you are an "inferiority complex sufferer," you must pretend to be pitiful and create some materials about being bullied, preferably materials about being bullied by women. You can even write one or two articles yourself for women to scold you. If you are the "nth kind of person," you must put on a detached face, indicating that you are only loyal to your own art. And it is best to venerate a figure from foreign writers who "ignores politics," and find a document from classical literature that says the masses are useless, which will be even more sensational for a time.</p>
<p>However, this is not the most advanced "strategy," because the personal brand is too obvious. There is another category of the most advanced strategies.</p>
<p>For example, when popular literature rises, it is very inconvenient to publicly oppose it, so you start from another aspect, saying that the vocabulary in the articles of young writers is too small and that they should find a new one. But the books designated to find vocabulary are very ancient antiques and are very far removed from the masses. This achieves your own purpose secretly. For example, when anti-Japanese literature becomes the common effort of everyone, it is even more inconvenient to publicly oppose it, so you come up with another way, saying that all the current works are "stereotyped anti-Japanese," which naturally seems to hope for good anti-Japanese literature on the surface, but in fact, as soon as you deviate from the theme of anti-Japanese, you can only attach to the theme of "peace," which again secretly achieves your own purpose.</p>
<p>I ask, how can lawyers compare to such "strategy"?</p>
<p>Alas, lawyers are in the past. It is truly amazing to see writers complete the art of "strategy" to such an extent! But one thing I am anxious about is that after all, energy is limited. If writers only devote themselves to studying strategies, they will inevitably not be able to engage in writing. Although lawyers are not ambitious, they still write many complaints in their lives. I am just afraid that our writers will end up not even being as good as lawyers!</p>
<h3>Song of Parting</h3>
<p>— Gu Sifan</p>
<p>In Yuqian</p>
<p>One day, at my friend Qi's Wenbi residence in Yuqian, two girls moved in. The older one was gentle and dignified, while the younger one had bangs and was lively and interesting. They made beds out of door panels, surrounded by mosquito nets made of bedsheets, and the floor was covered with straw, serving as a bed for their friend, a very elegant and handsome young man. They were all students from the Zhejiang Youth Wartime Work Corps. The two girls were sent from the provincial capital to Yuqian County on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, and the man accompanied them there. After staying for a day or two, he prepared to go to the Suzhou-Changzhou area, as he was an intelligence officer for the New Fourth Army in the occupied territories.</p>
<p>They loved to laugh, make noise, and sing, hardly ever stopping. They made a fuss all night, but the next morning, they had sneaked off to play somewhere. When we got up, it was eerily quiet outside. Passing by their room, we saw straw scraps and peanut shells all over the floor, with a few books scattered around: "Popular Philosophy," "Field of Life and Death," "Literary Front." Qi's wife smiled and said:</p>
<p>"What does this look like?"</p>
<p>"A dog's kennel," I replied jokingly.</p>
<p>Qi remembered something and said:</p>
<p>"The younger one is like Lulu, with the same bangs and liveliness. Just hearing her Hangzhou accent makes me think of Lulu when she was little."</p>
<p>"Why don't I think so?" I said.</p>
<p>"Because you met her in Shanghai when she was already grown up."</p>
<p>Yes, at that time, she had already been a teacher for many children, and we parted after only a few meetings. It has been almost three years since then. Last autumn, when I went to Changsha from Shanghai, I passed through Jinhua and learned that she had gotten married. I unexpectedly saw in her wedding photo that her husband was also my friend. Five years ago, when I was studying at a middle school on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, he was the school's registrar. Later, his love affair with a female teacher in the elementary school department ended, and he left the school. No one knew where he had wandered off to.</p>
<p>This spring, passing through Jinhua again, friends told me that they had separated not long after they got married. Lulu joined the New Fourth Army's training camp, and her husband joined the guerrilla forces in Jiangnan. But now, Lulu is about to graduate, and he has died in an enemy encirclement. She wrote a letter to her friends in Jinhua:</p>
<p>"I don't believe this is real. Is this really real?... Give me the courage to live on..."</p>
<p>I told Qi about this, and Qi also wrote a letter to comfort her:</p>
<p>"I heard that you are saddened by your misfortune, and I felt the need to write to you because I am one of your old friends. I guess your sorrow will soon be overcome, just like others who have experienced the same changes. People originally have emotions and reason, they can be excited and calm. Moreover, there is still great work laid out before you!"</p>
<p>But I believe Lulu will become stronger through suffering. Just like those insignificant neighbors of ours, like Lulu, such spoiled young ladies are also able to leave their fallen hometowns, wear military cotton coats, and run around in unfamiliar places.</p>
<p>I soon left Yuqian.</p>
<p>On the eve of leaving Yuqian, we drank too much wine and turned off the lights, but no one could sleep. Qi was very excited, reciting Du Fu's poem, "Tomorrow, separated by mountains, worldly affairs are vast and uncertain."</p>
<p>"When will you come again?" Qi's wife asked.</p>
<p>"If the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not cut off, I will come in half a year," I replied.</p>
<p>"Don't believe him!" Qi shouted wildly, "Guangxi is three thousand miles away from here! And even if he comes, will we still be in Yuqian? By then, we will have already wandered off somewhere else!"</p>
<p>No one spoke anymore. Outside the window, the moonlight slept in the melancholy valley.</p>
<p>Outside, they started making noise again. The two girls were laughing, and the man shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"My eldest daughter! My youngest daughter!"</p>
<p>Qi's wife couldn't help but laugh and said:</p>
<p>"Listen! What a doting father!"</p>
<p>As the laughter subsided, they began to sing the tragic "Song of Parting," the last two lines of which are:</p>
<p>Farewell, farewell, classmates!</p>
<p>We will meet again on the front lines! It is very easy to bring tears to people's eyes.</p>
<p>The next morning, it was eerily quiet outside again, but when we passed by that room, the situation was completely different: the floor was swept very clean, and the straw mat was gone. He had already left.</p>
<h3>Classroom Professor of Flight (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Sha Hong</p>
<p>Normally, to train someone to fly solo, it inevitably requires eight to ten hours of training in the air. Using the Link Trainer, the time for sky practice can be reduced by half, and it only takes one hour in the sky to succeed - or even less than one hour. George was the first person trained by this trainer in 1928, and he only practiced in the air for forty-two minutes.</p>
<p>Today, pilots need to be able to recognize their routes in the fog using wireless signals and be able to land through ceiling circles. Learning blind flying with the aid of wireless light requires completely rigorous training. This trainer can best prove its value on this point. Usually, a pilot can only perform blind flying after flying in the air for fifty hours, but now, it only takes twenty hours of training in this trainer, followed by five hours of flying in the air.</p>
<p>A trainer completely designed for teaching blind flying has more attachments - a table for the instructor and tools for communicating with the fake aircraft. Telephone guidance and wireless direction signals from the hypothetical airport where the student is landing are emitted from this table. The table is equipped with an ink indicator that automatically shows the aircraft's heading.</p>
<p>The pilot in the cockpit must trust the instruments and listen to the machine. Assuming he wants to fly to Pittsburgh, he must raise the aircraft to an altitude of four thousand feet, set his flight speed, and then fly forward smoothly, paying attention to the signals in his ears. His wireless aeronautical chart is placed in front of him.</p>
<p>When he leaves the cockpit, the ink indicator has already drawn his flight path. This is a record for leisure study and a basis for future guidance.</p>
<p>Link can quickly turn a beginner into an instrument expert, which is of great military value. Great Britain, having lost two hundred and fifty poorly trained pilots in the last war, purchased two hundred and fifty Link Trainers, distributed throughout the empire. Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan also adopted Link trainers to train pilots. The pilots of the aircraft that Chamberlain flew to Berchtesgaden and Munich in Germany, and the pilots of the escorting German aircraft, were all successfully trained by Link trainers. During the Sino-Japanese War on the Yangtze River and the Spanish Civil War, many combatants in the air battles on both sides were also trained using Link trainers.</p>
<p>Link has successfully created the person needed by the new world, and this is his everlasting contribution. Now that this trainer has shown some military value, it is expected that its great effectiveness will gradually be revealed in the future development of air transport and the expansion of aerial armaments.

<h3>How Can We Catch Up!</h3>
<h3>A Bundle of Wild Grass</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Overture</p>
<p>Loneliness teaches people to think, solitude makes people imagine more. Deep in the night, listening to the ticking of the clock, I jot down these fragmented thoughts.</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>First, I thought of time. What a difficult problem to grasp! (Where does it come from, and where does it go?) An aestheticist said: "Time deprives you of the roses of youth." Others say: "Don't go to clock shops and listen to your youth being devoured." Thus, people tremble in fear before time, worrying about rosy cheeks turning into white hair.</p>
<p>"How many possibilities are there in one second?" Who knows? I am not asking for a mysterious answer, saying that there is a dark hand pulling the net of fate. Friends, be careful, you will be amazed at the changes that time brings to people. There are too many.</p>
<p>The child in our memory has learned about love; the lively person has walked into the grave. Look at our motherland! How has it surpassed time in the race against it and progressed rapidly?</p>
<p>That's right. This is exactly what I want to race. Don't be afraid, and don't tremble. Grab it and complete the work we should do.</p>
<p>Happiness</p>
<p>"Happiness is sometimes very close to people, even within reach, but people still lose it." I can't forget this sentence for a long time. Happiness often wanders in the wilderness, unable to find a patron.</p>
<p>I often remember the embarrassed faces of those who are teased in uproarious laughter. People are accustomed to building their own happiness on the suffering of others, saying that they have gained happiness. But alas, the answer is uncertain.</p>
<p>Happiness is not selfish. In this turbulent era, there is no personal happiness. Everything is attached to the nation. Abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial, striving for one's own benefit will not succeed.</p>
<p>Happiness will fall on the good sons and daughters of the motherland.</p>

<h3>Has Stalin Seen Our Play?</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>—Fourth of Random Memories of Meibian—</p>
<p>"Has Stalin seen Chinese plays?" This is a question that has lingered in our minds (the members of the Mei Opera Troupe) since returning from performing in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union! This emerging and great Soviet Union! Every book and every action seemed too mysterious! If we hadn't experienced it ourselves, we would never have believed the eight words in "Travels in the Russian Capital" (by Cai Yunchen): "The network of prohibitions is dense, and the investigations are strict."</p>
<p>Regarding the political "clear and muddy distinction," please forgive me for being a coward. I do not have the courage, nor the knowledge and qualifications, to arbitrarily comment. As someone who has always regarded myself as an "actor" or "performer" (I am a graduate of the Nantong Opera School and a "short foot" of Mr. Mei Wanhua - the inverse proportion of "high foot"), I will speak about the industry I am in. I will briefly write down the impressions of the secret police that we gained during our travels to the Soviet Union and the performances, as well as the "mysterious and interesting" memories of whether Stalin actually saw our performance, and provide them to the readers.</p>
<p>When the special ship "Northern," sent by the Soviet Union, arrived in Vladivostok, the first thing that caught our eye was the Red Star fighters, armed and standing upright, wearing long robes. The magnificence of their bearing! I unconsciously felt infected and straightened my hunched back.</p>
<p>The inspection by the tax officials was very kind and casual. This was our special treatment. (This was the case when traveling to Japan and the United States in previous years. There was also a French artist who returned to his country from Beijing via Manchuria and Siberia, and was subjected to harsh treatment by the tax officials. Later, in his luggage, I found a photograph given to him by Mei Lanfang, and he was immediately released. This artist deeply lamented the greatness of the "magic power of Chinese artists" in his travelogue! His writing was thorough and meticulous. I and Mr. Xu translated it into Chinese, and I will find it and make it public to the readers.)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has very strict restrictions on the import and export of valuable items! I remember when Ms. Hu Die landed, the diamonds and jewelry she carried were too rich and dazzling! The calloused and rough hands of the big men couldn't help but be surprised and cause twists and turns. However, she eventually got away with it and still carried her "alluring neon lights" (a nickname I gave to women's accessories) ashore with a flourish. What was the reason? It turned out that this clever "butterfly" had anticipated this before she went abroad. Although her jewelry box was full, nine-tenths of it was "fake."</p>
<p>In the dining room of the Chelnskin Hotel, the magnificent and mournful "Volga Boatmen" tune was playing on the stage. We tasted the flavor of "real Russian cuisine" for the first time. The manager and even the waiters of this hotel could speak fluent Shandong dialect. Especially the waiter who was specially sent to receive us spoke pure Beijing dialect. If it weren't for the racial characteristics of his face, I would have thought he was a "Jing Youzi" (a Beijing person who is good at rhetoric).</p>
<p>Starlight is brilliant, and Hollywood stars are so fit!</p>
<h3>Tan Xinpei's First Visit to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Old Supporting Role</p>
<p>Tan Xinpei came to Shanghai during the era of Ten Shops and Nine Mu of Fields. I have already heard about it. I am unable to detail it. As for between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, I was studying in Shanghai and heard and saw things that I can talk about. So I wrote it down to provide information for those who love to talk about the anecdotes of opera.</p>
<p>Tan Xinpei's first visit to Shanghai was with the Guixian Teahouse on Daxin Street. It seems it was during the Xinchou year of Guangxu, which is the twenty-first year of Guangxu. Guixian was created by Ying Guizhi of Ningbo. Before Tan Xinpei arrived in Shanghai, the various newspapers often reported on it, saying that Little Jiaotian was coming to Shanghai to perform. Small newspapers such as Li Boyuan's Youxi Bao (Game News), Li Yuxian's Yuyan Bao (Fable News), and Sun Yusheng's Xiaolin Bao (Joke Forest News) introduced his art, but never mentioned which theater he would join. However, because Tan had a familial relationship with Xia Yuerun, a martial artist at the Danggui Teahouse, everyone suspected that he would definitely join Danggui. At that time, there were four theaters in Shanghai: Tianfu, Tianxian, Danggui. Guixian was newly established and had not been around for long. (Tianyi was already closed.) When the Shanghai newspapers revealed that he was joining Guixian, it was said to be beyond everyone's expectations. In fact, actors perform for a guaranteed fee, which has nothing to do with familial ties. However, it can be seen that at that time, opera enthusiasts had a poor understanding of the customs of opera troupes. Tan Xinpei was using the stage name Little Jiaotian at this time, and his guaranteed fee was only 800 yuan per month, which was already three times that of Zhu Guifen's guaranteed fee. One martial artist, Tan Junpei, came with him. He flopped on his first day singing "Hua Hu Die" (The Flowery Butterfly). After that, he never appeared on stage again. Later, when I asked actors who came from Beijing, they all said that they didn't know anyone by that name in Beijing. So it is possible that the actor was deliberately being mysterious, thinking of attaching himself to a famous person to make a name for himself. On Tan Xinpei's first day, he sang "Kongcheng Ji" (The Empty City Stratagem) and "Daizhan Zilong" (Replacing Zilong for Execution). The seat prices in the main hall and the octagonal corners were as high as five corners. Therefore, business was not prosperous. He was with Guixian for about half a month. I saw him perform three plays: "Kongcheng Ji," "Hongyang Dong" (Hongyang Cave), and "Biemu Luanjian" (Farewell Mother, Chaotic Arrows). It was around the time when osmanthus was fragrant. Several years later, he came again and joined Danggui on Zhengfeng Street. At that time, in addition to the original cast of Danggui, there were Beijing actors such as Zhu Suyun and Sun Yiyun. But I can barely remember them. Also, since I came to Shanghai in the Gui Si year, the old male actors I have seen from Beijing, except for Zhu Zhongfen who was with Tianfu, Tan Xinpei's visit was definitely the first. (Sun Juxian's first visit to Shanghai was before I arrived. His second visit was after Tan's.) As for those before what I have seen, I do not know. However, based on what was said at the time and what was revealed in the Shanghai newspapers, he was definitely a famous actor from Beijing when he first came to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Success of Nan Shan Kelly, the Female Lead in "Bandits"</h3>
<p>— Chen Jie</p>
<p>Genius and Cultivation Combined</p>
<p>To be a movie star is actually not an easy thing. Not only must you have talent, but you must also have very good cultivation. We won't talk about the exquisite and moving acting skills of Nan Shan Kelly, the female lead in "Bandits"; now I will introduce a short history of her own account. She was requested by the editor of an American film magazine. The original can be found in Morie Mirool's country.</p>
<p>"I will never forget my mom and dad.</p>
<p>My mom taught me how to act, and my dad taught me how to dance. Before my mother got married, she was already a pillar actress in the New Orstre Theater. Now she not only teaches me how to move, but also how to cry. She said that an actor should know how to cry. I often do this and practiced a kind of expression that can cry actively anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>When I was four years old, my mother took me to a filming studio, which belonged to Paramount. The movie being filmed at that time was Gloria Swanson. At this time, a child who was good at expressing crying emotions was needed. The several temporary child actors in the studio did not do well. The director came to us and asked my mother. My mother said that I could cry, and she asked me to cry. I really cried, and it was very real.</p>
<p>Since then, I have acted with Li Quedix, Qin Hexu, Warner Pester, and others. Especially Warner, he was so kind, amiable, and heroic. He often took me to the garden and the zoo. He often introduced me to his friends, saying, "This is the future big star!"</p>
<p>In the beginning, I did not go to school. I always listened to my mother's teachings at home. When I was eight years old, I was already acting on stage. My mother often corrected my pronunciation, expressions, etc. I often performed actions alone or with my mother at home. Later, I also studied French and read many French scripts...</p>
<p>Later, I went on the radio to broadcast. When I was acting in New York, I was discovered by a Hollywood director and signed a contract with him. I moved to Hollywood with my mom and dad.</p>
<p>I am only eighteen years old now. However, no matter how small an achievement, I will not forget my dearest mom and dad."</p>
<p>I have translated these paragraphs here. It can be seen that an actor's success is by no means accidental. Indeed, genius and cultivation must be combined, and "upward mobility" must be maintained at all times in order to seek further development. Here, I send this hope to Chinese female stars!</p>
<h3>Where Is Lan Ping, the Progressive Filmmaker?</h3>
<p>— (Huicun)</p>
<p>The progressive filmmaker Lan Ping has had several extraordinary performances in the circle of love. It is remembered that several years ago, at the group wedding of three pairs of artists under the Six Harmonies Pagoda in Hangzhou, Lan Ping and Tang Na were one of the couples. However, not long after, Tang Na was abandoned, and Lan Ping went to live with Zhang Min, who already had a wife. However, Tang Na was still reluctant for Lan Ping's sake, and there were several suicide attempts.</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, Tang Na, Lan Ping, and Zhang Min, these three happy enemies, all had a new understanding and went their separate ways to do sacred anti-Japanese work.</p>
<p>After the war broke out, Lan Ping first left Zhang Min, with whom she had been living, and went to the interior to join the Salvation Drama Troupe. It was not until the summer of last year that she and Ouyang Hongying arrived in Yan'an together. Because the journey was long and the traffic was obstructed, it has been a year and a half since then, and news of her has been cut off.</p>
<p>Now, the author has received a letter from a friend in Yan'an. It is said that after graduating from "Kangda" (Anti-Japanese Military and Political University), Lan Ping is now employed at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts, serving as a teacher and life instructor. There is even more good news to report. Lan Ping currently has a home. Not long ago, she officially married a local celebrity, and the wedding was held under the principle of simplicity.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing and Others Launch a Grand Concert of Famous Actors and Amateur Performers</h3>
<p>— Du Bing</p>
<p>—To Raise Funds for the Epidemic Hospital—</p>
<p>Don't forget those dates—July 1st and July 2nd—when Shanghai's amateur performers and famous actors will jointly hold a concert to raise funds for the epidemic hospital's medical expenses. The location is the Guohua Radio Station, and the time is from 2:00 p.m. every day. It's getting hot. But what are they busy with?</p>
<p>According to Yu Qiaqing, the initiator of the concert, the epidemic hospital has been diagnosing and treating the sick and saving millions of poor and sick civilians every year. However, now prices are soaring, and drug and material costs are also rising. If a sum of money is not planned in advance, won't we be watching the living civilians die of epidemics during a long summer?</p>
<p>Jin Tingsun, Wu Limen, Yuan Ludeng, Dou Yaoting and others also expressed some opinions on caring for the poor and sick. So it was decided to invite Bao Xiaodie and others to be responsible for preparing the concert of amateur performers, while the participation of famous actors would be presided over by Chen Yuelou, the chairman of the Actors' Association. Of course, what readers need to be told is the lineup of their concert. However, every famous actor in Shanghai is enthusiastically willing to shed a few drops of sweat for the poor and sick, so on the newspaper, everyone's name is already familiar to you, and your favorite popular characters will all meet you in the air. Due to space constraints, it is not necessary to write their names. Please don't forget those dates—July 1st and July 2nd.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Master Hongdou of Hongdou Hall is capable of everything from civil to military, Kunqu to miscellaneous operas</p>
<p>Mr. Xiyuan has extensive knowledge. Because he loved drama since he was a child and formed a group, almost more than half of his life's energy has been spent on studying drama. He is over sixty years old this year, but he is still very energetic, and he has not lost any of his waist and leg skills. A few months ago, I saw him casually performing a "Qunying Hui" (Gathering of Heroes) xiaosheng (young male) posture somewhere. His body bent down in a bowing gesture, and one leg could still be stretched straight, which was very beautiful and elegant. It is said that he obtained the true teachings of Lengxian. If this kind of posture is used on stage, a pair of pheasant feathers, rising and falling, plus this extremely stylish posture, it is truly indescribable. Lengxian was a top student of the living Zhou Yu, Xu Xiaoxiang. After Xiaoxiang went into seclusion, Lengxian won the title of first xiaosheng. Although Mr. Xiyuan only slightly tried his skills, it was enough to show the scholarly general style of Zhou Yu. At the same time, I have also seen him perform "Qi Shuang Hui" (The Strange Couple) with Lanfang. All kinds of skills, such as writing the complaint, three pulls (Zhao only has one pull), breaking into the courtyard gate, the god of pulling the sleeve, throwing the boot bottom, swaying the gauze wings, etc., show that his work in learning Wang's art is very profound.</p>
<p>In addition to the male role, the old gentleman also learned "Zhan Wancheng" (Fighting Wancheng) Cao Cao from the living Cao Cao, Huang Runfu. The posture of stepping on the green seedlings on horseback is not right in today's circle of experts. Sir Ruishui is quite proud of this, but I heard people say that he is still imitating the old Pu. (Some people also say that it was taught by Mr. Bo.) In addition, Mr. Xiyuan also performed the ugly maid of "Fēngzheng Wù" (The Kite's Mistake). Whether he was taught by Da Liqi, I don't know. In short, Mr. Pu's knowledge is broad and versatile. He is capable of everything from civil to military, Kunqu to miscellaneous operas. He is even slightly better than Chen and Wang. Moreover, during the late Qing Dynasty, his status and value were very respected. No matter what famous actors there were in the circle, as long as he wanted to learn any difficult famous play from them, as long as he gave an order, who would dare not pass on all his abilities to him? Therefore, even the most difficult Kunqu opera, "Quanben Ning Wuguan" (The Complete Ning Wuguan), is now only fully available from this gentleman. Although Shu Yan, Ju Peng, and De Bao all cherish this play very much, they are not as good as Pu. It is feared that one or two of the three are still learning from Mr. Pu, so they will of course not be able to surpass their predecessors. (48)</p>

<h3>Continued Records of the Yang Yuelou Abduction Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the Yang Yuelou affair, after a few days, the local magistrate brought the case up again for re-examination. According to Zhang Wangshi's testimony, "Abao was promised to Yuelou, and when the Wei family was in Shanghai, they also agreed to it," and so on. The magistrate did not inquire further into the details. At the time, the three boxes belonging to Wei Wangshi were given for her to collect. Those belonging to Yuelou were also sought and collected by a guarantor. Wei Wangshi was released, but soon fell ill and died from worry. Yuelou was imprisoned outside the jail, and Abao was confined to the official matchmaker's office. On the thirteenth day, the case was re-examined. Wei, the head of the family, was summoned to clarify the matter. It was confirmed that there was no such thing as arranging a marriage or betrothing Abao to Yang Yuelou. Because the head of the family was unwilling to take her back, Abao was flogged again and sent to a charity hall to be matched with someone. After Yang Yuelou was sold again, the local magistrate charged him with the crime of abduction, intending to sentence him to military exile and transfer him to the prefectural court. After the prefect of Songjiang Prefecture brought him up for interrogation, Yang Yuelou kowtowed and pleaded his innocence, saying that his confession in Shanghai, "deceiving Abao's parents in order to abduct their daughter," was obtained through torture. The prefect, seeing this, felt pity and said, "I know that you have been wronged!" Upon hearing this, Yang Yuelou felt as if he had been freed from shackles and ascended to a nuptial bed. He kowtowed deeply and said, "I have hope for life again! I am grateful for your clear judgement. You truly have the power of life and death over me!" However, the prefect still commissioned Lou County to re-examine the case and ordered him to be severely beaten two hundred times, warning him not to retract his confession. Therefore, Yang Yuelou did not dare to retract his confession. The prefect made a determination and, according to procedure, transferred him to the provincial court. Now it is heard that Censor Wei has also brought up the case for questioning. The judicial commissioner is fair and just and unwilling to increase the sentence. When Yang Yuelou arrived in Songjiang Prefecture, he retracted his confession as before, not changing his words at all. The commissioner thought that it was normal for criminals to cry out for injustice. If someone had been tortured to the point of disability, they might falsely confess out of fear of torture. But since there was no sign of injury from torture, how could he allow him to be cunning and deceitful? Thus, he followed procedure and sent the case back to Songjiang Prefecture for re-examination. So, he admitted to adultery and abduction. Yesterday, the state and county yamen were notified step by step from the province to return him. He has already been imprisoned again by order of the local magistrate, as he had already made a confession in the court of the investigating commissioner, and a detailed report has been submitted to the governor for verification of the crime. He will soon be able to request a decision and be sent into exile! Alas! The dust and wind of the four thousand li beyond the Great Wall, even though Yang Yuelou has wandered the world and experienced hardship, I fear he will find it hard to bear! Looking back at the flowery days and wine-soaked nights, the dark green and red lights, I wonder what regrets he will have!</p>
