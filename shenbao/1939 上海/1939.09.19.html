<p>里加　聞蘇聯軍隊已開抵維爾納、共地距蘇波邊界八十五英里、距立陶宛邊界二十五英里、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞國京城　波蘭國軍官與各國駐波外交官、正紛紛來至羅國境界、據彼等傳來消息、蘇聯與德國燮方軍隊、各向波蘭東南部勒伏夫城疾進似欲爭先到逹、綠穗蘇兩軍侵入波蘭、彼此應以何處為界限、此在蘇聯出乓之前、並未商定、因之各該國軍部相遇時、頗有發生意外情事之可能、波軍仍在各路前綫抵抗德軍云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　蘇聯軍隊開入波蘭境內、未引起此間政界之眞正驚異、據巴黎人十意見、德方雖極力宣傳、然事實上迄未有蘇聯行動與德一致或蘇聯現加入戰局為德後盾之證、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　蘇聯進乓波籣東境之後、今日正午、此問官方發表文告、闡述比事與德蘇間之關系、內稱、「德蘇兩國政府為制止外間謠言起見、今特發表文告、表明德蘇兩國軍事行動、次不損及兩國本身之利益、更不抵觸互不侵犯條的之精神、反之、穗蘇兩國之軍事行動、其目的乃在恢復波蘭之秩序與安寗、協助波蘭人民樹立新秩序」云、（十八日海通電）</p>

<p>倫敦　此間波蘭大使館、頃府曾於一九三三年七月三日、發表公報稱、「蘇聯軍隊」一千四百員名、已於本日在多數地方、越過波蘭邊境、當由波蘭邊防軍力加抵抗、其在摩洛區諾城一帶、戰况允為劇烈、查蘇聯託詞波蘭政府不復存在、政府當局亦已離開國土、致使戰區以外之人民、失所保障、實則此種掩飾、直接侵略行動之詞、毫無置辯價値、波蘭政府現正負責竭盡一切方法、對穗抗戰、蘇聯政府今晨所為、實乃明白違反蘇波兩國前於一九三二年七月二十五日在莫期科所簽訂之互不侵犯條的、不寗唯是、蘇聯政與波蘭暨其他數國、在倫敦簽訂互不侵犯多邊公的、而為侵略國下一定義、聲明一國凡以武力侵犯他國領土者、即為侵略國、同時並在公的內規定、簽約各國在無論何種情勢之下、不得援引政治的經濟的軍事的或其他情事為口實、而出以侵略行動、職是之故、蘇聯政府今晨蓄意侵略波蘭之所為、實已自承違反其所接受之國際義務、揆諸該國自加入國聯會以來、所標榜之各項道義的原則、亦即該國政府自稱為其外交政策之基礎者、實亦互相抵觸」云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>波羅邊境科都　此間波蘭政府今日發表公報云、波蘭駐蘇聯大使昨巳拒絕接受蘇聯軍隊擬開入波蘭之照會、波蘭政府贊同該大使此舉、該大使已請蘇聯發給出境護照、波蘭政府現仍照常執行政務、波軍亦屢獲勝利、蘇聯照會中所列之理由、殊難成立云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　蘇聯軍隊開入波蘭之後、波蘭國政府頃以照會送達各國政府、聲明蘇聯此舉、乃係侵略行動、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　此間負責人土頃宣稱、蘇聯軍隊開入波籣國之後、英國現行態度、不致變更、張伯倫首相哈里法克斯外相暨多數閣員曾集議竟日、討論蘇聯出兵一舉所引起之新局勢、同時外務部當局、亦與法國大使考賓、波蘭大使賴泰斯基、會談甚久、截至目下為止、波蘭尚未與蘇聯正式宣戰、因此賴泰斯基大使亦未要求英國對於蘇聯決定立塲、換言之、波蘭並未要求英國宣佈與蘇聯宣戰、蓋以英波兩國現行互助條的、並非針對蘇聯故也、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c6">重慶各報　未加評論 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>重慶　今晨各報對於蘇軍侵入波蘭事、雖未加批評、惟波蘭之被瓜分、顯已使中國人對波蘭人民寄以最深切之同情、此種情緒、完全基於華人對於波蘭遭受侵略之同情、而非對於波蘭有特殊之好感、蓋波蘭曾承認「滿洲國」以取好侵略國也、已往數月中、國際事件所循之路綫、殊爲出人意表、故華人暫不作任何判斷、惟得一種印象、即國際問協定與諾言、今不能認為有效或値得信任突、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　共產黨機關新華日報今日下午獨未批評蘇聯軍隊攻入波蘭事、該報向來對於蘇聯之各種活動、及塔斯通訊社之消息、輒載於顯著地位、今晨對塔斯通訊社所發表之莫洛托夫演說、章未載一字、說者謂該報此舉、蓋恐登載後將引起華人、允其為中國共產黨之不良印象、因彼等或將不以蘇聯之舉動為然也、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c7">日本亦覺　大惑不解 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京　日本民衆、對於德蘇擬派分波蘭、及蘇軍侵入波蘭乃得德兀首許可消息、均表示驚愕、惟各報尚無評論、顯然有大惑不解之感、咸信此種局勢、將陷全歐於多年戰禍、惟另一方面、則認日本在遠東行動、將可因而更為自由、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　此間各軍事觀察家雖認波軍近數日中或尚能困擾德軍、但其注意點已集中於德國在波境將需要維持若干軍隊以對付蘇聯、各觀察家皆以為蘇聯突如其來之行動、係在阻止德國佔領波蘭全部、並建立屏障、以免德人侵入烏克蘭肥沃之榖田、所可注意者、即蘇聯行動、何以竟在最後一分鐘始通知德方耳、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎「巴黎晚報」頃戰有拉脫維亞國京城消息、德蘇兩國軍隊大的可於下星期初在波籣境內相値、按蘇聯出兵之前、該國駐德大使館陸軍武官布加奇夫上校會與穗國軍事常局有所接洽、及本月十六日晚間、蘇聯共產黨政治部接獲布加奇夫上校所提報告書之後、始乃決定佔據波蘭境內烏克蘭與小俄羅斯兩族聚居之處云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　據拉脫維亞通信社里加電訊、拉脫維亞駐蘇聯公使已接到蘇聯保證、對於拉脫維亞採取中立政策、又據羅馬尼亞京城官塲消息、該國駐蘇公使亦接到同樣保證、復據保加利亞京城消息、蘇聯侵入波蘭、巳引起該國深切印象、（十八日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c10">蘇聯遣軍入波蘭 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>八月二十三日，蘇德互不侵犯條的簽字；九月一日，德軍向波蘭開火；九月十六日，蘇「蒙」日「滿」邊境停戰協定成立；即於翌日，蘇聯遣軍入波蘭。蘇聯地跨歐亞，國力雄厚又與其地勢相稱；在茲歐亞風雲變幻之秋，實居舉足重輕地位；此其情况，為世界政家所熟知，英法謀與結合，德國遽與親和，職是故也；歐戰旣作，迄今將三星期，允見蘇聯所關之大，而今後將愈有具體的表現。</p>
<p>方蘇德互不侵犯條的宣告成立之初，世人莫不惶駭驚異，繼以種種猜測，以為慕後另有密的。今蘇聯實行遣軍入波，姑無論所根據之理由何若，要足使往日之猜測者益復自信其觀察之非謬。顧吾人以為兩國果有密的與吾，無從武斷；惟蘇聯出兵，實為其預定計畫，而不足為蘇德更進一步携手之左證。何則？蘇聯旣絕英法，不為波助，而德波勢力懸殊，即無待乎交戰而知之；英法所可為波助者，即在猛攻德國西疆。此就戰略言之，其初步意義，乃在分德兵力，同時鼓勵波軍抗戰；而主要意義，猶在併英法之力，以爭最後勝利。蓋明知德在西疆，必據壕固守，初非一鼓可下；復知德國必挾雷霆萬鈞之力，先行解決波蘭；所爭者，雙方時間之競賽，即英法尚未深入之際，波蘭能吾爭持稍久，非期波蘭以不敗也。故波蘭之敗，敗於蘇德訂的之時，非敗於德軍入波之後。蘇聯旣知波蘭無以自全又知德國野心無饜，斯蘇聯為本身安全計，為波境小俄羅斯與烏克蘭兩族計，於是遣兵疾進，爭着先鞭；莫洛托夫所謂「波蘭已成為各種意外變化又能發生之沃壤，從而將危及蘇聯…乃不能繼續維持中文態度」；是可以說明蘇聯之一部份理由，然其疑懼德國之心理，亦躍然紙上矣。若謂蘇聯出兵，由於德蘇之間先有成的，則又未信希特勒重諾蘇聯，而自為戎首。由是論之，此决謂為蘇聯防德之步驟可，謂其為兩國更進携手之左證，則竊以為不可！蘇聯此舉使堅苦奮鬥之波蘭民族，受其直接而慘痛之影響，自不待言；顧英法何似乎？其將徇波蘭之請，，直斥蘇聯為侵略國而對之宣戰乎？抑將忍氣吞聲姑且不聞不問乎？隱忍則此决對德宣戰喪其意義，對蘇聯宣戰則驅蘇德以沆瀣一氣，勝負未可知也。宜倫敦巴黎之迄無決定的表示矣。至於蘇聯，旣向英法等二十四國明白表示，願繼續維持中立關係；土耳其外長又赴莫斯科，以增進蘇土聯繋；羅馬尼亞固為防範蘇聯而與波蘭相盟者也，今不但未為波援，且以封鎖波蘭界邊聞；綜觀蘇聯國際環境之優越，殆莫如今日者。抑今後之蘇聯，將何似乎？揆之蘇聯之基本國策，漁利在所不辭，苦戰非所樂為！謂將明日助德而深入漩渦，殆有不然。觀於侵波之後，遽向二十四國聲明中立，固得視為告慰英法日，蘇聯不以兵力資德而戰英法也。所不可知者，對德之經濟資源，將如何相助；厚助則亦足破壞英法之封鎖政策，而使戰事之結束遙遙無期，是固灼然可覩者也。</p>
<p>夫是非曲直之辨，或以見仁見智而殊，然亦輒有極顯明之標準而不容意為抑揚者。若蘇聯之遽稱波蘭為不國，其論據將為任何人所費解；然於小俄羅斯與烏克蘭兩族行將淪於德國之頃，不復坐視，則又有未可報一而論者矣。凡此出入，時人或所聚訟，史家自有定評；我人所欲指陳者：歐洲積年紛擾，竟以鐵血為淸算之工具，是可歎息；而其最後之成敗利鈍，是吾式符於是非曲直、猶未可知也。以目前而論；英法旣敗於外交，而得失待決於疆塲；德國播弄風雲，而運命託之孤注，旣吞之捷奥猶成問題，遑論自前佔領之波土，蓋非得强援，終且無幸；蘇俄僅遺偏師，未經大戰，而此瞬息之間所得於波蘭者，旣有穩定之觀矣。</p>

<p>昨日外幣始以蘇日之簽訂停戰協定、貿氣殊盛、美金票抬至十五元八角半、近午巳退至十五元四角、下午電傳宋子文氏赴蘇頗為一般所重視、金市首當其衝、跌勢頗厲、故英美金鎊回跌亦勁、結果各降五元、美金票亦跌三角半、英余票小一元三角、香港票及法郞票各落一分、新加坡票低二角半、荷蘭票跌八角牛、坎拿大票降叫角澳金票小二元、惟安南票尚漲二角、日金票初一元三角七分五厘、卒為一元三角五分二厘、結果尚漲二分二厘、朝鮮票僅升五厘、其餘各幣尚穩、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市變動、範圍擴大、中途悄勢大致先緊而後轉鬆、初因日蘇簽訂諾蒙亨停戰協定、華商等前來扒結、加之日洋行亦跟跡力吸、以致英金一度退為三辦士九三七五、美匯亦會軟至六元二五、後因華行與日銀行界、先後紛來塞出、致潛勢轉鬆、午收回硬至英金四辦士零一五六二五、美匯六元四三七五、下午外電宋子文氏飛蘇消息、並又有和平空氣之傳設、因之華商等亟亟移轉目標、紛來吐售、兼日銀打亦續來拋塞、故市勢續鬆至失金四辦士零九三七五、美匯六元六二五、結果以四辦士零七八一二五及六元五三一二五收盤、較前均稍軋長、收後情况更鬆、美匯外行買價會硬逹六元六八七五、本月期貨趨勢與現貨相若、</p>
<p>英金一度進四辦士</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、與紐的跟價、均無來電、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美。對滬。對法均平、美對英。對滬亦均未更、對法小半分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、晨開銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦十零三一二五、美匯六元半、較之上週末、均無榮辱、開後因日蘇簽訂蒙滿停戰協定、華商等均前來扒結、加之日洋行亦跟踪吸購、是以趨勢緊軟、計華商與日洋行扒進外行麥加利大通某行現貨英金叫辦士及三辦士九六八七五、並現貨美匯六元四三七五及三二二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後外行賣價最緊、曾喊過英金三辦士九三七五、美匯六元二五、但乏成交做開、嗣後忽又有和平空氣傳說、故扒風頓戢華銀行首來塞出、同時外行亦賣意轉濃、計美行大通吐予洋行現貨美匯六元三七五、時某行吸進華行現貨英金三辦士九六八七五及四辦士、並現貨美匯六元四三七五、後日銀行界亦傾吐英金、但匯豐吃胃尚佳、計日行賣予匯豐等外行現貨央金四辦士及零三一二五、於是過程轉平、延至午收、銀行現貨賣似、英金四辦士零一五六二五、美匯六元四三七五、比晨開英微緊零一五六二五、美略軟零六二五、</p>
<p>賣風熾盛市勢急轉</p>
<p>後市因利空消息紛紜、故日銀行續來拋塞、兼華商亦來復出、並外行吃胃不佳、致為狀遂續鬆動、計日行正金與華商等賣予外行現貨英金四辦士零三一二五及零九三七五、兼現貨美匯六元半及五六二五、時銀行對於美匯買價最硬會還過六元六二五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士零七八一二五、美匯六元五三二二五、本月份英金四辦士零四六八七五、美匯六元四六八七五、結果比上週末、現期英均鬆零四六八七五、美亦均硬零三一二五、聞收後某行吸進華商現貨美匯已硬逹六元六八七五然賣價則討六元五六二五、</p>

<p>關於越界築路交涉、及日方要求調整防區問題、連日謠諑繁與、均難證實、今晨本埠盛傳蘇州河以北之英軍防區、已允移交日方、經本報向各方探詢、俱難得確切之消息、英國大使館方面、亦吾認其事、本報記者為查勘眞相起見、於今晨二時、親赴蘇州河北察視、天后宮橋及垃圾橋上、崗捕仍照常服務、天潼路蘇州河路一帶、則以時在深夜、已入戒嚴時間故未見警捕、其時該處萬簌俱寂、固毫無異象也、此外又傳大西路之警權、亦已移交偽「市府」、但據本報調查、知昨日為九一八紀念、捕房方面為避免衝突起見、故將巡捕減少、並無他意、惟租界當局對目前情勢、愼審應付、茲將昨日所得消息、分述如决、</p>
<p>調整防區　尙無建議</p>
<p>據外國消息靈通人士稱、木月十三日、日海軍陸戰隊司令　戶、召集英美意駐軍司令會議、其目的確為徵求各國司令同意、調整各國在滬駐軍防區、惟會議時、日本方面並未提出具體調整方案、詢之各與會司令、亦無準備提出具體方案者、於是日司令　戶聲明、如各國同意、日本方面、當可擬一具體建議、俾作今後討論之基礎、但截至目前為止、日方尚未提出方案、且與英國方面、亦未能取得妥協、以美國願為英國後盾、屢决整明不願變更上海地位、其駐滬負實官意態度之堅決、皆使日本不能不有所顧忌、而遽加武力壓迫矣、惟在目前情狀下、日本加緊採取政治手腕、以圖從租界方面、取得更大的權益、則十分可能、如越界築路問題、即其一例、日方報紙所稱、滬西越界築路一帶、工部局巡捕已自動撤退、雖無其事、但越界築路問題、十日半月後、終將分曉也、至外傳日本將封鎖北江西路至北西藏路英軍防區問題、則恐出於誤會、爰日本欲接收北江西路A段（北段）之英國防區、而英國則未予同意、故有此傳聞耳、</p>
<p>檢查往來　行人車輛</p>
<p>在越界築路沿海格路一帶、如愚園路口。靜安寺路口。大西路口。福煦路口、於昨晨起、均置有障礙物、僅留一狹口供出入、各處均駐有中西探捕及萬國商團一十餘人、檢查往來行人車輛、甚為嚴密、自地豐路至徐家滙一帶、如福開森路。億定盤路。霞飛路口、亦均加派有中西探捕駐防、並有裝甲汽車一輛、及車巡隊、往來巡邏上述各地、惟海格路四四八號林氏巨厦之側門、於昨日巳關閉、僅由大門出入、門首駐有偽警六名、形勢較前嚴重、</p>
<p>商團巡邏　越界築路</p>
<p>大西路自海格路起、至安和寺路止，沿途均有萬國商團乘軍用卡車往來梭巡、在法華橋兩端、各駐有偽警三名、檢查行人頗嚴、哥倫比亞路口之偽警分駐所前、本為偽警二人守望、但咋日巳增至六人、至靜安寺路一七六〇號匕海商業銀行職員宿舍、仍有偽警六名駐守、情形與前相同、無甚變化、憑園路之四明別墅中實新村門首、本由偽警二名駐守、但昨日已减為一人、惟漁光村對面之錢家巷口、駐守偽警巳增至八人、局勢轉緊、</p>
<p>僞警深入　白利南路</p>
<p>一二四九號及對面之依文思泰舞廳間壁、此兩處均為日商豊田紗廠之職工宿舍、向無偽警駐守、而昨日亦派有兩人守望、在兆豐公園之白利南路口、昨晨起突發現有偽警六名駐守、一般往來行人、見之莫不驚異、而捕房方面、最近頗少派捕前往巡邏、但昨日則特別增加巡邏探捕、而裝甲軍亦時往遊巡、</p>
<p>三角地帶　盡被封鎖</p>
<p>極司非爾路愛女義路口三角地帶、昨日情形、更見緊張、各出入口幾全為鐵絲網所阻斷、駐有大批意兵及中西探捕、祇留一小缺口、以備行人往來、而車輛等一概不能通過、故七路公共汽車、亦必須改道而行、對於往來行人、檢查綦嚴、形勢、十分嚴重、在膠州路新閘路口勞勃生路口、及康腦脫路延平路口、均設有鐵絲網、由意兵及中西探捕十餘入駐守、戒備亦頗嚴密、曹家渡方面、昨日防務頗見鬆弛、即偽警亦不多見、僅有少數崗捕、惟上路公共汽車、及十六路十九路無軌電車、均不能直駛五角塲、情形更見冷落、</p>
<p>戰區或接近戰區　事業限制</p>
<p>經濟部為維持戰區營利法人原有組織、會制定非常時期營利法人維持現狀暫行辦法、公布施行、該辦法規定戰區或接近戰區之營利法人、應維持原有狀况、股東會之召集、及董事監察人之改選、均暫延期舉行、原有之董事監察人、在延期內不得解除責任、其目的在防止奸人羼人、致事業因有破壞之虞、施行以來、尚有相當成效、惟僅就營利人維持其固有組織、對於各項事業之權益移轉抵押或變更、尚未一律加以限制、其資產之</p>
<p>運用範圍</p>
<p>及限制擅與外商訂立合的、亦尚未有規定、仍未足盡維持保護之能事、復經呈奉行政院、核准規定戰區或接近戰區各項事業限制</p>
<p>辦法五項</p>

<p>公共租界防範佈置、因鑒於經過情况良好、故已於昨晚七時先將各國防軍區內解嚴、同時防軍以及萬國商團義勇隊之臨時動員準備令、亦於斯時起撤銷、至於警務處對各馬路間之戒嚴令、以及障礙物、限止交通等、則遲至昨晚十一時、方行撤除、恢復常態、惟警備車鐵甲車仍在繼續梭巡、而探捕等之沿途檢查工作、亦未終止、爰斯項動態、乃警務上固定工作、故雖在平日間、亦施行不輟、同時宵禁後更予嚴密實施、</p>

<p>予以封鎖</p>

<p>（重慶航訊）國內大學敎授邱友錚君、頃撰著「各國師範敎育烏瞰」一文、於歐美日俄各國師範敎育趨勢、縷述甚詳、茲摘要節錄於下、我們研究現代師範敎育、以德法意英美日俄等七國為參考、有三種趨勢、（一）歐洲大陸的德法意三國、是行「統制政策」、對中小學師資、限制極嚴、視師範校為敎員檢定的準備塲所、（二）英美兩國、是行「放任制度」敎育事業、歸民間團體地方政府或私人創設者居多、師範亦不能例外、（三）日俄兩國、一則以天皇為重心、一則以共產社會為歸趨、認師範為國策實施上的御用機關、故可概名之曰「工具主義」、此三種方式、對中國師範敎育、均有影響或暗示、中國師範敎育的演變、原由獨立而附庸、今更由附庸而轉向獨立、民國初年、大概是仿效日本、有國立高師及省立師範、復有師範講習所與實業敎員養成所等、此外、尚有女子師範與男子師範校同等稈度、均單獨設置、民國十一年、實行新學制、師範敎育、隨六三三制而變更、稈度或有提高、然無形中將專門培養師資之精神取消、省立師範為高級中學的一部、國立高等師範、多數升格為普通大學、僅設一敎育學院、這又是美國學制之所賜、乃者、中國敎育現階段、已為抗戰建國的在流所激蕩、敎育當局、深識各級學校之敎師、肩荷頗鉅、非經人格的、科學的、乃至專門的訓練、不足以任重致遠、故有國立師範學院之建立、及師範敎育區等籌擬、我們的希望、當然是在創造適合中國實際需要的一種制度、不必再事東抄西襲、允其希望能永久的奠定了國民模範人倫師表的基礎、不至復有朝更夕改的現象、以是最近各國師範敎育的情態、究竟如何、想亦為關心及研究師範敎育者所願聞也、茲分述各情如下、</p>
<p>歐陸的統治政策</p>
<p>歐洲大陸諸國的師範敎育、當以耶拿戰役、為其發逹之關鍵、拿破崙擊敗普魯士時、德國哲學家斐希特竭力呼號、喚起國民、勸告政府、速謀敎育之改革、並主張遺派留學生研究斐斯塔洛齊的敎育精神與方法、其後該批人員、悉充師範學校校長、迨一八二五年德國的師範敎育、已見獨立設施、建築起鞏固的基礎、法國在拿破崙時代的師範敎育、固有建樹、但自基佐敎育部長以來、收歸國家直接管理、並要求每縣一律設置、則為一八三二年事也、歐陸諸國、經此刺激、咸起而着手經營、並以師資的培養、屬於國家特權之一、這種觀念、實已蔚為一代風尚、</p>
<p>（一）法蘭西　法國初等敎育、最為發達、國立小學校、係按每鄕區無論人口多少、法定必設男校一所、人口在五百以上、必設女校一所、故其師資之訓練、亦頗能平均分配、現行制度、是根據一八七九年的法令、指定每縣設置男女師範學校各一所、故現有男女師範校各八十八所、其間例外者、不過一二縣而已、其入學資格、為高等小學校普通科程度、因為法國的中學校、修業七年、銜接於初等小學校、因此、其年齡則為十五歲至十九歲、其入學必經考試、其在校的每年學終、亦有考試、最後學年、當至其附屬小學校實習、所授課程、有敎育心理學、社會學、敎育、倫理、哲學、其决法語及文學、歷史及地理、外國語、敎學、又物理及博物、衛生、作業、家事、（女）再圖畫、雕刻、及幾何畫、唱歌、音樂及體操、均屬每舉年敎授之科目、還有少時間的農業理論、及多時間的手工與農業、但畢業考試合格、僅可得高等免試狀、充任見習敎育、積二年之經騐、年齡逹二十歲、再經檢定、如實地敎學的試騐、及敎育、管理、學校經營、敎育實際問題等試騐、如獲通過、可得敎員勝任書一紙、但未滿兵役義務者、仍無此權利、得此證書者、可充實任敎員、此後、則在敎育範圍內、尚有自由發展餘地、</p>
<p>法國的中學校有兩種、一是國立的、一是地方立的、此外師範學校及高等小學校、亦在中等敎育過程之列、故其師資的訓練、亦有兩種高等師範學校、一為中學高等師範學校、男校設於已黎、女校設於佛色爾、修業三年或四年、招收前述的兩種中學校畢業生、又即造就前述兩種中學校的師資、一為小學高等師範學校、男校設於Stcloud、女校設於Fontenayaux　roeee、以招收師範學校的畢業生為主體、修業二年、亦即造就師範學校及高等小學校的師資、可是、這兩種高師畢業生、在學校均為試騐的標準塲所、資格均由試騐而決定的法國、仍不能立刻取得敎員的正式資格、還要經過試騐、且國立中學校的敎員、必當取得「考充敎授」的稱號、所謂考充敎授、當由考試而來、其應考資格、為一般得有碩士學位者、每年由敎育部計算Lycees的需要、公開舉行試騐、有哲學、文學、文法、歷史及地理、外國語、（英、德、意、西班牙、或阿拉伯）數學物理及化學、乃至博物等八項、所謂中學高等師範學校、當然是為受這種試騐的標準塲所、</p>

<h3 id="c91">不是爲批評家辯護 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 塵兮</p>
<p>文壇上的轉變也眞多，有一個時期，專是批評家批評文學家，到了後來文學家聯絡起非文學家反轉來批評批評家；直到最近，這情形才不大熱鬧了。</p>
<p>究其原因，則大抵是這樣：某種文學家因了批評家的「謾罵」，（是吾準是「設罵」還是問題）雖然在這樣一個偉大時代，結果還是把文學作品縮了進去，專門等待，等待一個機會批評家也有創作出品，於是也罵；假如久待而不見有出品，又罵：「你說這文章不好，這文章太壞，結果你自己也寫不出一點佳作給人家讀過！」批評家似乎也看懂了這點，於是祇是高嚷着「沒有作品」，而且他也存心給文學家駡，「永不出品」；文學家無可奈何，也祇長嘆一聲走遠了。</p>
<p>據實說來，文學家的作品，除非是「藏之名山，傳之後世」的，那末他一個人儘管可以自己鑑賞，也可以自吹自捧，人家（讀者及批評家）決不致會說「不好」「太壞」，即使要說也無從說起了。但「藏之名山」的時期早已過去，而且覺得自己也是吃飯的動物，總不能餓癟了肚子，一天到晚唱高調。於是乎祇能把作品放進社會，旣入了社會，即發生了價値，這就是商品，而且立刻就「版權所有」了；假如有人肯出價去賣，則他至少是付有代價的，他好像是應當有這份權來說好道歹的。這樣說來，「批評」，眞是文學家所該受的罪名了；其實假如說一部作品的寫出，因為被人批評幾聲，就說「不討好」了，這也未免太過火：我覺得作品被批評並不是無補於作家的，說聲好固能使作品傳播益廣，道句歹，則也能使作者知道點自己的短處；祇要批評者是正直的（不私心），作者是虚心的！</p>
<p>固然文學家的悄惡批評家一半是為了批評家高踞文壇，傲視一切，以致有亂評，謾罵的情形，但這決不能因噎而廢食，不能因為這一筆抹煞了批評的眞諦，而且我的意見以為不正確的「亂評」是決不能？永生」的，不久定有人會代駁的。而現在呢一部份的文學家因批評家的批評都把作品縮進去了，大有讓文壇留起空白來的意思。但是這樣的噤口捲舌，不聲不響，却也並不有利於文壇！</p>
<p>而批評家的批評，在文學家認為是「謾罵」，在第三者看來，或者以為是最恰當的判斷，那問題就在文學家不要太把「文章是自已的好」認為至理名言，因為批評家不能因為作家是自己的什麼人，於是想從批評中討得人家一些好，就妄指着一個娼女說：「她是世上第一偉大的英雄！」當然也不能因作者和自己的惡感就指眞正的英雄為娼婦。</p>
<p>至於文學家停起筆來等批評家的作品，這是近乎些笑話的。人家早已有了厨子和食客的譬喻，這裏也從略了。</p>
<p>我不是批評家，沒有為批評家辯護的必要，也沒有懀惡創作家的可能，假如一定要說出我的立塲，則以上所說的話，全是一個普通讀者的意見。</p>
<h3 id="c92">區隊長 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 丁山</p>
<p>長條子，挺結實，胸脯像塊鐵，那麽硬繃繃的，臉上滿是一粒粒紅豆。不大活潑却是再神氣不過的，眼睛老愛瞅住人家的面孔——我好幾决被它們盯得臉紅。</p>
<p>這是我受訓時的區隊長，軍校的十一期入伍生</p>
<p>他兇而且橫，當他瞪着眼吼：「軍隊里沒理，要有理，命令就是理！」我們便嚇的垂下頭，因為如果有點難看的表情，長腿子就會掃過來；那會使你疼上一整天。</p>
<p>也許他沒有忘記我們終究是「少爺」出身，（如他說）我們野外操得很苦時，個個透着沒奈何的神氣，不住地拉着草綠色的寬袖子拭汗：他便像大哥哥似地，半帶譏諷，半帶可憐地說：「你瞧！多不中用！回頭上戰塲『臥倒』了，就爬不起來啦！告你，換塲多流汗，沙塲少流血，……哼，就歇歇——向後轉，你們的『水槍』也該放放了。」</p>
<p>他愛打諢倒是眞的，閒着和我們無所不扯，挺愛問我們有戀人沒有？我們也同樣的問他，他就愉快地笑着說：「有哇！姓金名倉——喒們到了時候就結婚，咱在晚上就得抱着她在戰塲上睡覺！」</p>
<p>區隊長是吉林人，被問到「家」時，他的下顎低了一點，但馬上仰得更高了，不大活潑的瞳人更定住了，胸扳更直了，除了乾澀的「長春」兩字，他再也不說什麼。另外些時，他歡喜着，就自己說出他會經在小白山幹過沒本錢的賣買，（說時微笑了，）他領過鬼的敎，（說時冷笑了。）……</p>
<p>「為了正義，為了生存，為了自由，戰事不該免了。」我們前年八月解散時，他興奮地說：「我呢，進軍校的心願也可以償了。」</p>
<p>「喒們還能再見？」我莫名其妙地凄問。</p>
<p>「為什麽不？」他吼了，「在吉林！」</p>
<p>「我不是吉林人呀！」</p>
<p>「你是中國人呢，」他溫切地望着我，輕鬆地笑着說。——那個明朗的笑容，我眞忘不了。</p>
<p>兩年來，他跟他的戀人自然早已結婚了，而且一定有了「孩子」，完成區隊長的「結婚」的願望，我想。</p>
<h3 id="c93">德軍眞的不怕潰敗嗎？（下） <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Fritz　Sternberg著　朱基俊譯</p>
<p>從地理上看來，法國可能在此戰爭中獲得光輝的勝利，但同時穗國也有許多人相信（如一九一四年那樣相信）他們可在幾個月之內獲得優越的勝利。然而，在西方，德國所遇到的國家，她的工業水準也是很高的（難在某些生產部門上，她較德國落後，）她很能在技術上，化學上，馬遠化上空中和毒氣上和穗國周旋。因此，德國如，要在西方從容地獲得軍事上的勝利是不可能的。如此，在西方，旣沒有工業的條件也沒有軍事的條件，可以使穗國獲得光輝的勝利，在東方呢，更沒有上述兩種很好的條件，而且連地埋上的條件也缺乏。</p>
<p>所以，從純粹的軍事上的觀點判斷起來，第二决的世界大戰將是一個長期的戰爭——除非人民大衆出而制止。一個長期的戰爭眞是德國國社主義統治的最大危險，因為戰事遷延下去時，那些在戰爭初期給予德國若干軍事上的優勢的諸因素（整個軍需工業的動員）將反過來毒害她。</p>
<p>假如德國在開戰時即盡量利用她的生產力，那末以後她勢將不能大量增加她的生產；因為她　很快就逹到牠的頂點，而此後生產力即將開始衰退，且將以從未有過的高連率急劇衰退下去。</p>
<p>另一方面，假如一個國家在戰爭爆發前幾年中，甚至在軍擴狂然的幾年中，具備着非常卓越的和平時代的生產力，那末在戰爭中她尚可有很多努力的餘地，而大大地增加她的軍需工業的生產力，同時生產力的頂點可較遲到逹，而牠的衰退的連度也可以稍為慢些。然而穗國可並不如此。</p>
<p>除非德國法西主義很快就獲得勝利，吾則牠就完全不能獲勝，因為由於德國國內反政府傾向的長足的發展，生產力衰退的速率（這是戰事一遷延就會到來的）將驚人地增高。第二决世界大戰將是一個長期的大戰，而國社主義的德國將等不到戰爭結束而先行消減。</p>
<p>霍亨索倫（Hohernzollern）皇室的德國投入大戰漩渦時，祇準備了軍事而沒有在經濟上預為籌劃。她有着經濟上的弱點而被戰敗了，協的國方面則因鋼，鐵和糧食上的優越而獲得勝利。</p>
<p>法西斯的德國正在從上决世界大戰中尋求敎訓。她正同時建立一個軍事的和一個經濟的參謀本部而去投入第二次大戰的漩渦，她同時更將以一個法西國家的身分投入漩渦。僅僅如此而巳。</p>
<p>然而，僅有軍事的和經濟的參謀本部决不能打勝仗；人民大衆的擁護也是必需具有的。但現在他們大多數都反對國社主義的統治，雖然這種反對是潛伏的隱秘的。</p>
<p>假如戰事長期遷延下去，則亨姆勒（Hlmmler）的預言，即在這第二决世界大戰中，德國必將發生內戰的預言，將可怕地應騐出來。</p>
<p>希特勒能支持戰爭多少時候？</p>
<p>僅能支持一决激烈的戰爭</p>
<p>但不能支持到第二决世界大戰所需要的那個長時期。</p>

<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>南鐵生已於昨日（十八日）起，輟演黃金，鐵生演罷後，黃金戲院當局，本擬邀坤伶章遏雲，繼之登台，演唱數天，以待早已邀就而為洪水阻隔小克來申之宋德珠等京角到逹後，再行讓擋，茲以宋德珠等一行人，業於日前（十七）搭順天輪來滬，於是章遏雲繼南鐵生後出演黃金之計劃，遂成泡影。</p>
<p>此决黃金戲院，所邀之宋穗珠楊寳森吳彥衡等大批京角，愚嘗在本報一一介紹，茲悉除以前邀妥之人馬外，復有袁世海慈少泉二人加入，隨宋楊等同來。</p>
<p>袁世海嘗一度隨尚小雲來滬，但未能予滬人深刻印象。其實，世海之藝，殊値得一提也。世海工架子花臉為富連成五科淨角傑出人才，在科時，私淑大師兄侯喜瑞，凡侯之傑作，如「丁中山法門寺」「穆柯寨「普球山」「盜御馬」，世海皆稱拿手。出科後，為尚小雲小翠花諸名伶雖致去，其藝更由私淑侯喜瑞，而力摹郝壽臣，壽臣在故都，有「活曹操」之譽，蓋以言壽臣篩曹操之逼真也。世海之白臉戲，力學壽臣，久而久之，遂亦染成郝氣十足，凡郝之傑作，如「黃一刀」「桃花村」審李七」，世海演來頗獲佳與；最近世海更投於壽臣之門牆，拜郝為師矣。世海嗓不甚衝，但韻味十足，身上架子，可謂美觀。雖投郝之門，其藝實近於侯，更以世海在科時，學侯處實多，愚意以為世海不如取侯郝二人之精華於一爐，以世海之天資好，根基好，能如此前途殊未可限量。慈少泉為名丑慈瑞泉之子，嘗數度隨程硯秋南下，演戲墨守成規，不油不滑，有乃父風，惟少泉未嘗走紅，始終居於二路配角地位，者番南下，或能一展所長也。</p>
<p>宋德楊賽森等一行人，即定於二十一日起，在黃金登台，宋德珠之三日打泡戲，與前所定，略有更改，首日為全本辛安驛，此戲係老水仙花秘本，與前决毛世來所演者不同；决為水漫金山寺，此為德珠之成名傑作，黃柳霜前年去平，會邀德珠將此戲拍成影片，携美放映；第三日為大英傑烈，宋穗珠自離戲曲學校後，鋒铓畢露，在平之聲勢，不亞於西大名旦，此决南下，尚係第一遭，是吾能號召觀衆，尚難預卜。第以宋等一行人，多為戲曲學校，與富連成之優秀人才，雖屬小輩英維，咸為後起之俊俊，諒來必能為滬人一新耳目也。</p>

<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>拍片工作不受影響</p>
<p>自從二决歐戰爆發，電影膠片來源大受影響，因德國矮克發廠出品將有斷絕之虞，目前雖尚有少數存貨，而交戰國之航輪均已調回本國軍用，故在運輸上發生許多困難，目共價亦因之高漲數倍矣。</p>
<p>目前大量供給電影膠片者，允推美國之柯逹，該公司因現時美國尚未捲入戰爭漩渦，故仍繼續大批出品，以供應各國影界之需要。</p>
<p>中國在重慶之兩大國營製片廠「中國」與「牛電」，以前對於膠片問題，素有來源不易之感，在歐戰未發生前，運輸已頗困難，且時因避免空襲，而箝延時日，影響拍片工作；在歐戰發生後，外界之揣測，膠片之來源當更感困難矣，設或美國加入戰團，則柯逹公司將無出品可以應需，故不但「中國」「中電」無片可拍，即各國影界亦將大受影響。然事實上一中電」與「中國」早已有未雨綢繆之籌劃，目前「中國」港廠，巳購存大批膠片，而「中電」亦於不久之前派攝影主任周克去港，接洽膠片事宜，亦巳購進不少，暫時存放港地。一俟需用，即可隨時運往重慶。故在目前，縱美國柯逹出品告斷，而重慶兩大國營片廠之膠片，短期內仍可告無虞云。</p>

<p>— 貝尼</p>
<p>「人之初」去年「上海劇藝社」會在法工部局大禮堂公演過，由於原作者巴若來見血的諷刺，細膩的刻劃，演出後轟動劇壇，後來新華公司計劃將「人之初」攝製電影，經幾次接洽後，終告成功，當時決定由劉瓊担任男生角（張伯南），顧蘭君担任女主角（蕭麗蓮），片名則定為「金銀世界」，公映後甚得名界好評。</p>
<p>最近，「上海劇藝社」在「璇宮劇院」長期公演，本來計劃原班人馬，把「人之初」重演一下，時間預備在中秋節前後，這是一月以前的事情。</p>
<p>後來，所說原來演張伯南的顧德剛，因事不能出演，而舒適呢？「日出」正演得起勁，自然不能分身，這樣一來，劇藝社當局就考慮新的人選，這時正好在演花濺淚」，吳永剛也常在劇社裏，（因他因「花濺淚」導演）於是大家共同商談之下，想到了「金銀世界」裏的劉瓊，一經商談，毫無問題，至於原來舒適的一角，則由「沉淵」裹演趙笙齋的茂雲來担任，這倒也是「得其所哉」的配置</p>
<p>夏霞這次和劉瓊在舞台上還是第一决的合作，在「精而細」的導演吳仞之先生的排演下，演出成績，大概是不會錯的。</p>

<p>Riga - The Soviet Red Army, which began invading Poland yesterday morning, is now advancing rapidly along the entire border. It is reported that in the north, they have already crossed Baranowicze, which is 34 miles from the Soviet border. Today, they may meet German forces in Brest-Litovsk, a historically famous city 180 miles east of Warsaw. In the south, troops may also come into contact with German forces this morning in Lviv, southeast of Warsaw. (Reuters, October 10)</p>
<p>Moscow - The General Staff of the Soviet Red Army issued the following communiqué on the operations of September 17: On the morning of September 17, Red Army units crossed the western border along the entire line from Chabanaia Dvinaro (Soviet-Latvian border) to Denistro (Soviet-Romanian border). After driving back weak Polish outposts and reserves, they reached the following locations that evening: In the northern western Belarus front, they advanced to the town of Glubokoje, the Barafianovo station, occupied the railway junction of Molodechno and the town of Volozhin. Those advancing towards Baranowicze have forcibly crossed the Neman River and occupied the towns of Korelichi, Mir, and Boronechka, the Baranowicze railway junction, and the town of Snoŭ. On the southern western Ukraine front, they occupied the towns of Rovno, Dubno, Tsybalash, Tarnopol, and Kolomyia. The Soviet Air Force shot down seven Polish fighters and forced three military bombers to land. All crew members have been detained. (TASS, October 18)</p>
<p>Riga - It is reported that Soviet troops have arrived in Vilnius, which is 85 miles from the Soviet-Polish border and 25 miles from the Lithuanian border. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania - Polish military officers and diplomats from various countries stationed in Poland are arriving in Romania one after another. According to their reports, Soviet and German troops are rapidly advancing towards Lviv in southeastern Poland, seemingly vying to be the first to arrive. Regarding where the border should be between the Soviet and German armies invading Poland, it was not agreed upon before the Soviet Union sent troops. Therefore, there is a possibility of accidental incidents when the military departments of the respective countries meet. Polish troops are still resisting the German forces on all fronts. (Havas, October 18)</p>
<p>Moscow - It is reported that the Soviet government intends to give Silesia and the Danzig Corridor to Germany, while the Soviet Union will occupy western Ukraine and establish a buffer state between the Soviet Union and Germany. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>Danzig - Reports say that military and political figures from Germany and the Soviet Union will hold a meeting in Brest-Litovsk today to decide how to divide Poland and establish a new Soviet-German border. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>London - If the German and Soviet armies meet in Poland in the future, or if Germany intends to occupy the entire Poland alone, and the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops is beyond Germany's expectations, then the current situation will undoubtedly make Germany feel difficult. In short, it is necessary to wait for the situation to continue to develop before it can be determined whether the Soviet Union's actions have obtained Germany's consent, or whether the two sides have reached an understanding in advance to divide Poland. As of this point, there has been no information received here to believe that the Soviet Union intends to help Germany fight. (Havas, October 17)</p>
<p>Paris - The entry of Soviet troops into Poland has not caused genuine surprise in political circles here. According to the views of Parisians, despite Germany's best efforts to publicize it, there is in fact no evidence that the Soviet Union's actions are consistent with Germany or that the Soviet Union is now joining the war as Germany's backing. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>Berlin - After the Soviet Union sent troops into the eastern part of Poland, the official here issued a statement at noon today, elaborating on the relationship between this matter and Germany and the Soviet Union, stating, "In order to stop rumors from spreading, the German and Soviet governments are now issuing a statement, stating that the military actions of Germany and the Soviet Union will not harm the interests of either country, nor will they violate the spirit of the non-aggression treaty. On the contrary, the military actions of Germany and the Soviet Union are aimed at restoring order and stability in Poland and assisting the Polish people in establishing a new order." (Haitong, October 18)</p>
<p>Berlin - Political figures here believe that since Germany and the Soviet Union have issued a joint statement stating that the two countries are cooperating in their meeting in Poland, those who hope that Germany and the Soviet Union will have differences in resolving the Polish issue can rest. People here solemnly declare that Germany and the Soviet Union agree that Poland does not have the conditions for sound survival. The ethnic groups in the country are extremely diverse, and the government's measures are perverse, and it is taking its own demise. After the country is reduced, the various ethnic groups living in the area should be reorganized according to natural boundaries in order to form a sound economic standard. According to observations by Berlin political figures, the above-mentioned statement can also be regarded as a reply from Germany and the Soviet Union to Britain and France's attempt to interfere in Eastern Europe, stating that the two countries are determined to reorganize their sphere of interest in order to ensure peace in that area. After Poland is disintegrated, Britain and France's promises to assist Poland have completely lost their value, and at the same time, the treaties concluded by the Western European powers and Poland will also lose their meaning. (Haitong, October 18)</p>
<p>Paris - Diplomatic figures here recently declared that Romania and Poland have a mutual assistance agreement stipulating that Romania should provide assistance when Poland is invaded by the Soviet Union. Now, on the one hand, the Soviet Union is sending troops to Poland, and on the other hand, it is sending notes to various countries, including Romania, stating that it is abiding by its policy of neutrality. In this way, the Romanian government can continue to regard itself as a neutral country without having to assist Poland. Regarding this, the German radio station has already issued a message, but what decision the Romanian government will make has not yet been officially notified. What can be said is that, given its geographical situation and military strength, Romania will hardly be able to form a hostile relationship with Germany and the Soviet Union at the same time. In short, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Romania will have important developments in the next few days. In addition, Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is scheduled to go to Moscow within days. The purpose of this is also to inquire about the Soviet Union's intentions towards the Balkan countries. At the same time, the Italian government is also closely monitoring the Soviet Union's actions, because the Soviet Union's current actions are a sign of the revival of Pan-Slavism. Italy is more averse to Pan-Slavism than it is concerned about Pan-Germanism. (Havas, October 17)</p>
<p>Moscow - After the Soviet Union sent troops into Poland, the Japanese here were quite pleased that the Soviet Union might have disputes with Britain and France. The people of the Baltic coastal countries, namely Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, were even more shocked. Diplomatic figures generally said that there is no doubt that the Soviet Union had reached an agreement with Germany in advance. However, it is not yet known whether the content of this agreement is only aimed at Poland. It is speculated that Germany is progressing rapidly in Poland, which even the Soviet Union did not expect at the beginning. Therefore, it urgently sent troops to occupy the areas that Germany had promised in order to prevent the Soviet Union from taking the lead and seizing them as its own. As for the coal and oil-producing areas in the eastern part of the Polish province of Galicia, they will probably be occupied by Germany. In the future, the Soviet Union and Germany will use the Bug River as the boundary, which is roughly the same as the boundary line drawn in the 1917 German-Russian Peace Treaty (i.e., the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). (Havas, October 17)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Poland Accuses the Soviet Union of Violating Past Treaties; Ambassador to the Soviet Union Will Lower the Flag and Return Home <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>London - The Polish Embassy here recently issued a communiqué on July 3, 1933, stating that "Soviet troops," numbering 1,400, crossed the Polish border in many places today and were resisted by Polish border guards. The fighting in the Molodechno area was fierce. The Soviet Union's excuse that the Polish government no longer exists and that government authorities have left the country, causing the people outside the war zone to lose their protection, is actually a claim that covers up direct acts of aggression and has no value for debate. The Polish government is now responsible for exhausting all means to resist the Soviet Union. The Soviet government's actions this morning clearly violate the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty signed in Moscow on July 25, 1932. Moreover, the Soviet government signed a multilateral non-aggression treaty with Poland and other countries in London, defining an aggressor nation as one that uses force to invade the territory of another country. At the same time, the treaty stipulated that the signatories should not invoke political, economic, military, or other circumstances as an excuse for aggression under any circumstances. Therefore, the Soviet government's deliberate aggression against Poland this morning has admitted that it has violated its accepted international obligations and also contradicts the moral principles it has touted since joining the League of Nations, which the Soviet government claims is the basis of its foreign policy." (Havas, October 17)</p>
<p>Koto on the Polish Border - The Polish government here issued a communiqué today stating that the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union refused to accept the Soviet note proposing to send troops into Poland yesterday. The Polish government supports the ambassador's actions. The ambassador has requested the Soviet Union to issue an exit passport. The Polish government is still conducting government affairs as usual, and the Polish army has repeatedly won victories. The reasons listed in the Soviet note are difficult to establish.

<p>London - Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the British government may not have an immediate reaction to the international situation until it receives various detailed reports of the Soviet invasion of Poland. The British government intends to discuss the matter with the French and Polish governments first before deciding on a plan. The situation is developing rapidly and will soon become clear. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>London - Those in charge here recently declared that Britain's current attitude will not change after Soviet troops entered Poland. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and most cabinet members met for an entire day to discuss the new situation caused by the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops. At the same time, the Foreign Office authorities also had long talks with French Ambassador Corbin and Polish Ambassador Ratajski. As of now, Poland has not officially declared war on the Soviet Union, so Ambassador Ratajski has not asked Britain to decide on its position towards the Soviet Union. In other words, Poland has not asked Britain to declare war on the Soviet Union, because the current British-Polish mutual assistance treaty is not aimed at the Soviet Union. (Havas, October 17)</p>

<p>Chongqing - Although the newspapers here this morning did not criticize the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland, the partition of Poland has clearly made the Chinese people feel the deepest sympathy for the Polish people. This emotion is entirely based on the Chinese people's sympathy for Poland's aggression, not because of any special fondness for Poland, because Poland recognized "Manchukuo" in order to curry favor with the aggressor. In the past few months, the course of international events has been unexpected. Therefore, the Chinese people are not making any judgments for the time being, but they have the impression that international agreements and promises cannot be considered valid or trustworthy today. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Communist Party's organ, Xinhua Daily, did not criticize the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland this afternoon. The newspaper has always published various activities of the Soviet Union and news from the TASS news agency in prominent positions. This morning, it did not publish a single word of Molotov's speech issued by the TASS news agency. It is said that the newspaper's move is probably afraid that publication will cause the Chinese people to have a bad impression of the Chinese Communist Party, because they may not approve of the Soviet Union's actions.

<p>London - Although military observers here believe that the Polish army may still be able to trouble the German army in the next few days, their attention has been focused on how many troops Germany will need to maintain in Poland to deal with the Soviet Union. Observers all believe that the Soviet Union's sudden action was to prevent Germany from occupying the whole of Poland and to establish a barrier to prevent the Germans from invading the fertile grain fields of Ukraine. What is noteworthy is why the Soviet Union's actions were only notified to Germany at the last minute. (Reuters, October 18)</p>
<p>Paris - "Paris Evening News" recently reported from the capital of Latvia that the German and Soviet armies may meet in Poland in early next week. According to reports, before the Soviet Union sent troops, Colonel Bugachev, the military attaché of the Soviet Union's embassy in Germany, had contact with Germany's military authorities. On the evening of the 16th of this month, after the Politburo of the Soviet Communist Party received a report from Colonel Bugachev, it decided to occupy the areas in Poland where the Ukrainian and Little Russian ethnic groups live.

From then on, Germany's expansion movement to the Near East will be seen to encounter obstacles. (Havas, October 18)</p>
<p>Washington - After Soviet troops entered Poland, diplomatic figures here said that the urgent task at hand is to determine whether the Soviet Union has formally joined the war, because the country's dispatch of troops to Poland could draw the Balkan countries into the vortex of war, and from there spread to the whole of Europe. Observers here mostly say that "it is imperative for Britain and France to supply the Balkan countries with military supplies." (Havas, October 18)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Soviet Troops Enter Poland <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>On August 23rd, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was signed; on September 1st, German troops opened fire on Poland; on September 16th, the Soviet "Mongolia" and Japanese "Manchukuo" Border Armistice Agreement was established; and on the following day, Soviet troops were dispatched to Poland. The Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia, its national power is strong and commensurate with its geographical position; in this autumn of changing fortunes in Europe and Asia, it occupies a pivotal position; this situation is well known to world politicians, Britain and France sought to combine with it, Germany abruptly befriended it, and that is the reason why; the European war has begun and will soon be three weeks old, demonstrating the great importance of the Soviet Union, and it will have more concrete manifestations in the future.</p>
<p>When the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact was first announced, the world was panicked and surprised, followed by various speculations, thinking that there were other secrets behind it. Now the Soviet Union is actually sending troops into Poland, regardless of the reasons on which it is based, it is enough to make those who speculated in the past more confident that their observations are not wrong. However, we believe that whether there are secrets between the two countries is impossible to assert arbitrarily; only that the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops is actually its predetermined plan, and it is not enough to be evidence of further collaboration between the Soviet Union and Germany. Why? The Soviet Union has broken with Britain and France and will not help Poland, and the disparity in power between Germany and Poland is known without waiting for a war; what Britain and France can do to help Poland is to launch a fierce attack on Germany's western border. From a strategic point of view, its initial significance lies in dividing Germany's military strength and at the same time encouraging the Polish army to resist; and the main significance still lies in combining the strength of Britain and France to fight for the final victory. It is clear that Germany will hold fast to its trenches on the western border, and it is not possible to take it down in one fell swoop; and it is also known that Germany will use thunderous force to solve Poland first; what is being contested is a race against time, that is, Poland can hold on for a little longer while Britain and France have not yet penetrated deeply, not expecting Poland to be undefeated. Therefore, Poland's defeat was defeated at the time of the signing of the Soviet-German agreement, not after the German army entered Poland. The Soviet Union, knowing that Poland could not protect itself and knowing that Germany's ambitions were insatiable, for the sake of its own security and for the sake of the two ethnic groups of Little Russia and Ukraine in the Polish border, dispatched troops to advance rapidly, striving to take the lead; Molotov said that "Poland has become fertile ground for various unexpected changes and can endanger the Soviet Union... and cannot continue to maintain a neutral attitude"; this can explain part of the Soviet Union's reasons, but its psychological fear of Germany is also evident on paper. If it is said that the Soviet Union sent troops because there was a pre-existing agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, then it is not believed that Hitler would honor his promise to the Soviet Union and become a leader of war himself. From this point of view, it is okay to say that this decision is a step for the Soviet Union to defend against Germany, but to say that it is evidence of further collaboration between the two countries, I privately think it is not possible! The Soviet Union's move has undoubtedly had a direct and painful impact on the hard-fought Polish people; but what do Britain and France seem to be doing? Will they comply with Poland's request, directly denounce the Soviet Union as an aggressor, and declare war on it? Or will they swallow their anger and pretend not to hear or ask? If they endure, then this will negate the meaning of declaring war on Germany, and declaring war on the Soviet Union will drive the Soviet Union and Germany into a unified front, and the outcome is unpredictable. It is appropriate that London and Paris have not yet made a decisive statement. As for the Soviet Union, it has made it clear to Britain, France, and other 24 countries that it is willing to continue to maintain neutral relations; the Turkish Foreign Minister also went to Moscow to enhance Soviet-Turkish ties; Romania, which was allied with Poland to guard against the Soviet Union, is now not only not providing assistance to Poland, but is also heard to be blockading the Polish border; in summary, the Soviet Union's international environment is almost as superior as it is today. But what will the Soviet Union be like in the future? Based on the Soviet Union's basic national policy, it will not hesitate to seek profit, and it will not be happy to fight a hard battle! To say that it will help Germany tomorrow and go deep into the vortex is unlikely. Judging from the fact that it declared neutrality to 24 countries immediately after invading Poland, it can be regarded as a comforting message to Britain, France, and Japan that the Soviet Union will not use its military force to support Germany in fighting Britain and France. What is unknowable is how it will help Germany with economic resources; heavy assistance will also be enough to undermine the British and French blockade policies, and make the end of the war far away, which is certainly visible.</p>
<p>The distinction between right and wrong, or may vary depending on benevolence and wisdom, but there are also often extremely clear standards that do not allow for intentional emphasis or suppression. If the Soviet Union suddenly calls Poland a non-state, its argument will be incomprehensible to anyone; but when the two ethnic groups of Little Russia and Ukraine are about to fall into the hands of Germany, it will not sit idly by, and there is no need to report one and discuss it. All these differences may be a source of contention among people at the time, but historians will have their own definitive evaluation; what we want to point out is: the years of turmoil in Europe have finally used iron and blood as a tool for liquidation, which is regrettable; and the final success or failure is something we don’t know whether it will match right and wrong or not. As far as the current situation is concerned; Britain and France have been defeated in diplomacy, and gains and losses are yet to be decided on the battlefield; Germany is playing with the situation, and its fate is entrusted to a single bet, and the annexation of the Czech Republic and Austria is still a problem, let alone the Polish territory occupied from before, which will ultimately be hopeless without strong support; Soviet Russia has only left behind a partial division, has not experienced a major battle, and what it has gained in Poland in this instant is already a stable prospect.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's editorial, several times it was said that it was 1930, which was actually a mistake from the 20th year of the Republic of China, and should be corrected to 1931; several times "issued the imperial edict" should be corrected to "eight years." Such a big mistake, I will check myself, and I am ashamed to the readers.</p>

<p>London The Admiralty recently issued a public statement, stating that the British aircraft carrier "Courageous" has been sunk by an enemy submarine, and the submarine was subsequently attacked by several British destroyers, and is believed to have been sunk. (Note: The Courageous was originally a cruiser, completed in 1917, and converted into an aircraft carrier after the war, with a displacement of 22,500 tons, equipped with sixteen 4-inch caliber anti-aircraft guns, and a speed of 30.5 knots per hour) (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>London The British aircraft carrier Courageous (22,500 tons) was sunk by a German submarine today. Several British destroyers immediately attacked the German submarine, and it is believed that the submarine has also sunk. The survivors of the Courageous have been rescued by destroyers and merchant ships and transported back to the port. The Courageous joined the reserve fleet in August and has been very effective in protecting merchant ships since the outbreak of the war. It was one of the first aircraft carriers built in Britain. When it was built in 1917, it was a cruiser and later converted into an aircraft carrier. According to the Information Department, when the Courageous sank, the number of aircraft carried had been reduced, and the number of personnel on board was also less than the original number. The original number of personnel on board was 1,200. When the German radio station announced the above news this afternoon, it only announced that the Courageous had been sunk by a German submarine, and did not mention that the submarine had been attacked by British warships.

<p>London The German News Agency issued a formal statement yesterday, accusing Britain's blockade of trying to starve German women and children, and Germany will use its weapons (referring to submarines) to deal with it. The British Information Department recently issued a statement in response, stating that economic pressure does have the effect of achieving combat goals, which has been recognized in Germany. The original intention of this pressure is to end the war as soon as possible with the least amount of violence, which is a completely legitimate method and is recognized by all civilized countries. Since the German state cannot exert effective economic pressure on Britain, nor can it make the economic pressure exerted by Britain on Germany ineffective, it has implemented internationally recognized illegal means and attacked merchant ships in an inhumane manner. It must be known that the pledge provided by other countries to US President Roosevelt must be adhered to by all belligerent countries to be effective, which the German state should remember.

In my view, the reasons given by the Soviet Union seem to be completely insufficient and completely unreasonable. The repercussions of this move cannot yet be foreseen, and it is useless to predict. However, one thing is certain, that no matter what, Britain will honor its promise to Poland. Polish freedom is a symbol of all our hopes, that is, the final overthrow of autocracy and the liberation of democracy and freedom. If Poland is temporarily overthrown, it will eventually rise again in new glory, proving the victory of overthrowing dictators and the establishment of permanent freedom in the world.

<p>Paris According to French sources, the results of the French artillery's first bombardment of the Siegfried Line are very satisfactory based on aerial photographs taken before and after the bombardment. However, it confirms the theory that many forts on the Siegfried Line were hastily built with inferior cement. According to a semi-official report reviewing the situation on the Western Front two weeks after the war, the French army advanced 20 kilometers along the entire front between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, in front of the Maginot Line, extending into Germany, and ensuring the absolute integrity of French territory. The German army is holding firmly to its positions on the Siegfried Line, and its progressively defensive outposts are now gradually benefiting from the situation on the Eastern Front. Germany is now sending elite troops and some air force from east to west to stop the French advance. According to the latest communique issued by the French High Command, there are no important developments worth mentioning on the front line, and air force activity has been reduced due to weather conditions.

<p>Berlin Foreign newspapers reported that the garrison of Aachen (also known as Aix-la-Chapelle) on the German border had been withdrawn. However, a report received here this afternoon stated that not only had the German troops not withdrawn, but there was no intention to withdraw. Several hospitals in the area had patients moved to other places last week so that the hospitals could be used for military purposes. The rumor that the German army was withdrawing from the area probably arose from this. (Haitong dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Berlin – The German News Agency just released a general headquarters war report, stating roughly that "the war situation on the Polish front is nearing its end. The city of Lviv in the southeastern part of the country has been completely surrounded by our forces. The city of Lublin has also been captured. The line held by our forces on the eastern front starts from Lviv, passes through Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Brest-Litovsk, and goes north to Białystok. As for our forces in southern Poland, they are advancing towards Sokal, Rava-Ruska, and Krasnystaw. Therefore, the retreat route of the Polish army east of Lublin has been cut off. Furthermore, there is currently no trace of the Polish air force on any front line. Our air force has completed its mission on the eastern front. Multiple squadrons and a portion of artillery units have been ordered to concentrate in preparation for other tasks. Apart from this, there are no significant battles on the western front. Near Saarbrücken, our forces shot down a French aircraft. There were no air raids over our country." (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German High Command issued a statement this afternoon stating that military operations within Poland are nearing completion. After surrounding Lviv and occupying Lublin, the German army's front line extends from Lviv to Volodymyr-Volynskyi, to Brest-Litovsk, to Białystok. In other words, the German-occupied area has exceeded half of Polish territory. The Polish army has been defeated by the German forces, scattered in many places, and lost contact. One of the strongest armies, accounting for about a quarter of the total force, is now trapped in the southwest corner of Wistne-rode, between the Vistula and Bzura rivers. Since yesterday, this army has shown signs of collapse. (Haitong dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Paris – According to French news from Lublin, although the German army is superior in numbers and equipment, the Polish army is still fighting valiantly on all fronts. Their morale and the spirit of the Polish government and people remain consistent and unwavering. It is reported that President Mościcki has sent a telegram, entrusted to the ambassador in Rome to convey to President Roosevelt, stating that in the past few days, German aircraft have deliberately and systematically bombed towns with clearly no military objectives, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties.

<p>Bucharest, Romania – The Polish Consulate in Cernăuți, Romania, issued a statement stating that Polish forces are currently engaged in fierce battles with both German and Soviet forces on all fronts. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Cernăuți, Romania – Foreigners arriving here from Poland report that Polish forces are resisting the German army along the line of Białystok, Brest, Lublin, Warsaw, Lviv, and Stryi in the east. The northern front is commanded by General Sosnkowski, the southern front by General Sikorski, and the central front in Warsaw by General Rommel. Polish air force pilots are extremely brave, often fighting against ten opponents without retreating. Furthermore, Soviet Ambassador to Poland, Sharikov, had a lengthy conversation with Foreign Minister Beck several days ago and then hastily returned to Moscow. At that time, it was still heard that he was planning to return to his post, but it has been five or six days without any news. Soviet troops have also entered Poland.

<p>London – Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck delivered a broadcast speech to the world last night from "somewhere in the southeastern part of the country," stating roughly that "the German army has seventy divisions, which are quite strong, and their air force and mechanized units also have an advantage. However, fierce battles are continuing on all sections of the front line. Although the Germans are using barbaric methods to bomb undefended cities, villages, and railway lines, the Polish army's ability to resist has not diminished in the slightest. Therefore, final victory will undoubtedly belong to the Allied forces. In short, the spirit of the Polish government, its army, and its people has not changed in the slightest and will certainly be maintained." (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Zurich, Switzerland – German radio broadcast a message at 6:00 PM, stating roughly that the commander of the Warsaw defenses has sent a representative to contact the German commander to discuss the evacuation of civilians, foreign nationals, and diplomatic personnel from Warsaw. The German commander immediately received him and presented the following conditions: (1) Civilians, foreign nationals, and diplomatic personnel should each elect a representative, who will travel in three cars at 10:00 PM via the Praga town and Minsk highway to the German outpost. (2) All cars should have their lights on and display a white flag. (3) The Polish authorities should order their troops to cease fire on both sides of the highway for a distance of two kilometers. The German army also agrees to do the same. After the Warsaw defense commander accepts the above conditions, they should be confirmed via radio broadcast. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to a report last night, the German threat to Warsaw has been slightly delayed because the commander of the Polish garrison in Warsaw sent an envoy to meet with the German commander. The report did not mention whether the Polish commander had accepted the German ultimatum to surrender within twelve hours. The German army threatened the people of Warsaw that if they did not surrender, they would destroy the entire city with artillery and bombs. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>

Military figures have strongly advised the city's defense commander to request a meeting with the German commander's special envoy." After sending a telegram, the German army immediately replied, expressing acceptance. The city's residents were filled with new hope. However, the reason why the special envoys of the Polish and German armies have not yet been able to meet is said to be that there is no responsible authority for military and political affairs in Warsaw, making it impossible to send representatives. In addition, Warsaw's food supplies are about to run out. (Haitong dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Zhang Qun's Observation: Soviet-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact Unlikely <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Zhang Qun, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, told an Associated Press reporter that Soviet-Japanese compromise faces numerous obstacles, making a non-aggression treaty unlikely. "It is a mistake to judge Soviet-Japanese relations based on Soviet-German relations. The Soviet Union and Germany have no deep-seated animosity, and their historical relationship has always been friendly. As for the Soviet Union and Japan, they have always been in a hostile and antagonistic position." This is the biggest difference. Zhang Qun also said that the Soviet Union did propose a non-aggression treaty to Japan three years ago, but Japan rejected it at the time because Japan has always regarded the Soviet Union as a thorn in its side, and Japan has been the most active in anti-communist activities. Furthermore, even if a non-aggression treaty is concluded, Japan will definitely withdraw its troops, while the Soviet Union will still retain its defensive forces stationed in the Far East. This is another reason why it is difficult to reach an agreement. As for the war against China, it has not intensified so far, but the Japanese plans are difficult to predict. As of now, the Japanese military actions in China are nothing more than strengthening their garrison position in Central China. It is expected that they will not take any major offensive actions in the short term. Not only that, the Japanese are now deeply aware that the front line is too long and vulnerable to our attacks, so they have taken steps to shorten their front line. In Guangdong, the Japanese front line has already been shortened, but they still cannot "eliminate" the Chinese guerrillas entering and exiting the Japanese front line. The Japanese action of shortening the front line proves that the Japanese forces are currently insufficient to maintain their long lines of communication. They are feeling insufficient to maintain the strength of the rear lines of communication. How can they have the strength to make a final offensive to resolve the war? However, the current Japanese are clearly trying to divide China's political groups and exploit China's resources to conquer China. Zhang Qun finally said that the European war not only has no impact on Sino-American relations, but also strengthens the relationship between the two countries. The difficulty is that the United States talks more than it acts. In fact, the United States has enough strength to dominate the balance of power in the Far East.

<p>Nomonhan – Representatives of the Japanese and Soviet armies at Nomonhan held a second preliminary negotiation at 5:00 PM on the 17th on the grasslands between the two armies' positions on the banks of the Khalkha River. The Japanese representatives were Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka, Major Irimura, and interpreter Ando. The Soviet side had Major General Potapov and one colonel, two majors, two captains, one second lieutenant, and one Mongolian major, a total of eight people. Major General Potapov first responded to the Japanese proposal from yesterday, saying that they had been ordered by the central government to be appointed as local ceasefire negotiating commissioners, and they hoped to start ceasefire negotiations as soon as possible. As a result of the agreement between the two representatives, it was decided to hold the first official negotiation at 4:00 PM on the 18th at the same venue as the meeting on the 17th. The second preliminary negotiation was completed in a peaceful atmosphere at 6:10 PM. (Domei dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Hailar – The official negotiations between the two armies on the spot over the disputes on the Manchukuo border started at 4:00 PM on the 18th.

Before the establishment of the committee, various negotiations will continue in Moscow. After the committee is completed, the contact point for both parties to negotiate local affairs seems to be designated as the Manchuria place. (Domei dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Foreign Ministry spokesman said this morning while hosting reporters, that he had the impression that the principle of resolving the Nomonhan incident could be extended to other parts of the border. When reporters asked whether a non-aggression pact could be concluded due to the border agreement, the spokesman replied that he did not have such a treaty in mind at the moment. The existing ceasefire agreement has nothing to do with the European situation. Japan does not want to interfere in the European war, but wants to concentrate its energy on resolving the China Incident. Therefore, Japan is prepared to enter into agreements with any other country regarding various outstanding issues, but it does not intend to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union at present. There are many unresolved issues between the Soviet Union and Japan. If they are resolved one by one, it may not be necessary to conclude a non-aggression pact. However, no one can say what will happen in the future. When a reporter asked who first proposed the ceasefire agreement, the spokesman said that this issue arose when Ambassador Tōgō to the Soviet Union and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov discussed various outstanding issues. The spokesman did not want to say anything about the future, but said that everything depends on the results of the work of the demarcation committee. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>New York – The local newspapers unanimously condemned the Soviet troops' entry into Poland, saying that Hitler and Stalin used the same brutal methods of aggression. The New York Post stated, "At this moment, no one in the United States should simply shrug their shoulders and say that the United States 'must isolate itself from the European war, and everything else is not worth considering.' Those isolationists claim that American interests will not be threatened under any circumstances. We dare not agree with this statement. The world is brewing major changes, and we must earnestly pray that these changes will not threaten our country, thereby forcing us to deal with it with force. It is true, but to say that these changes will not pose any threat to our country is also blind protection. If we obstruct it in many ways, so that our country cannot use its influence to cope with future events, it will be foolishness." The New York Times stated, "Stalin has betrayed Britain and France and concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany. The price he has obtained is the invasion of Poland by his troops. The Soviet government is no different from acting as a running dog for the German lion. However, even if Germany and the Soviet Union form an alliance, it may not be detrimental to the democratic countries, because once those countries get too close, their mutual suspicion will arise spontaneously. Hitlerism has been mixed with communism, and Stalinism has been mixed with fascism. The whole world also knows that the so-called ideological problem is nothing more than a struggle between democratic freedom, peace and authoritarian terror." (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>London – Renowned journalist Price recently published an article in the Daily Mail, commenting on the Soviet troops' entry into Poland. The gist of his words is that this kind of "unholy" alliance is too unnatural and unlikely to be effective. It may even bring disaster to Germany and the Soviet Union. He said, "The cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany is definitely not limited to safeguarding the interests of each country. It can be asserted that Germany will never want the Soviet Union's land and air forces to cooperate with it on the front line in Poland. It is unimaginable for national socialist troops and Bolshevik troops to fight side by side in any part of the world. Moreover, there are not a few communists in Germany. If the Soviet Union takes the opportunity to carry out red propaganda in Germany, the crisis will be too great for Germany to tolerate. Based on this, the combination of Germany and the Soviet Union is too unnatural and unlikely to be effective. It may even bring disaster to each country." (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Paris – The local newspapers commented on the Soviet troops' entry into Poland, unanimously expressing extreme indignation. The comments in Le Petit Parisien best represent the general view. It is said that "force and shamelessness have gained the upper hand. How can we allow this situation to continue? Judging from the past, this kind of action will eventually be rewarded. Britain and France will only do their best to uphold justice." L'Aube stated, "The reasons put forward by Stalin are not worth considering. The non-aggression pact previously concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union is in the name of non-aggression, but in reality it is about invading Poland. This is cruel and ridiculous. However, it is not impossible for the Soviet Union to take surprising actions against Germany in the future, even greater than what the country has inflicted on Britain and France during negotiations in Moscow. It is disappointing and dangerous for the Soviet Union to pursue this kind of diplomacy and use this kind of strategy, but Britain and France's determination to prevent Hitler and his partners from harming the whole world will not be shaken. Poland should still have confidence in its allies and friends and should have unwavering faith in its glorious future." Renowned journalist Pertinax published an article in L'Ordre, stating roughly that "as far as we can see, the Soviet Union's current policy aims to expand its territory, just as Imperial Russia did. In essence, the country wants to recover the provinces it previously lost. However, it is difficult to say whether it will take the opportunity to seize Bessarabia from Romania as revenge. However, after Germany and the Soviet Union divide the spoils, how their relationship will evolve is a matter of great interest." (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – The Fourth Session of the National Political Council in Chongqing, which opened on the 9th, lasted for ten days. Several plenary meetings were held, resulting in extremely satisfactory outcomes and abundant gains. In addition to those who attended the opening ceremony on the 9th, the following members of the Council successively arrived to attend this session: Hu Yuan-yan, Zhang Zhongfu,晏陽初, Tan Pingshan, Li Xiangen, Cheng Shewo, Chang Naihui, Liu Wang Liming, Yu Yuzhi, Zhong Rongguang, Zhang Shizhao, Liang Shangdong, Mo Dehui, Wang Zhixin, Wu Yifang, Li Yuanding, Tao Baichuan, and others, totaling 141 people, which is more than the number of participants in the previous two sessions, fully demonstrating the spirit of national unity and concerted effort to overcome national difficulties. At the first, second, third, and fourth meetings, the Council listened to the report of the Sichuan-Kangding Construction Inspection Group and the reports of the heads of the Executive Yuan and various ministries and commissions on the political, military, economic, financial, transportation, diplomatic, internal affairs, and educational situations over the past six months.

<p>(B) Stopgap Measures: (1) Request the government to issue a clear declaration that all Chinese people, except traitors, are equal in political status under the law; (2) In order to meet the needs of wartime, the government's administrative organs should be strengthened and reformed to concentrate talents from all over the country to engage in the work of resisting the war and building the nation, and to seek final victory.

<p>Content of the Sichuan-Kangding Development Plan</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Sichuan-Kangding Development Plan was formulated by the Sichuan-Kangding Construction Promotion Committee based on the report of the Sichuan-Kangding Construction Inspection Group. This plan has been submitted by the Speaker to the Council for discussion and has been unanimously passed, and it has been sent to the government for earnest implementation. The general explanation and attached recommendations are recorded as follows: (General Explanation of the Sichuan-Kangding Development Plan) The Sichuan-Kangding Construction Promotion Committee was established after the Speaker's proposal was passed by the Third Session. Subsequently, the Sichuan-Kangding Construction Inspection Group was organized, with 21 Council members designated by the Speaker to form five groups for the East Road, South Road, West Road, North Road, and Xikang, respectively. They departed successively in March and returned to Chongqing in July. Each group submitted an inspection report, and after several meetings, the results of the discussions on various topics were compiled into this plan. It should be stated that the sole basis of this plan is the report of the Sichuan-Kangding Construction Inspection Group. This report is the result of the efforts of more than 20 Council members over more than 100 days. All the problems raised were discovered through on-the-spot inspections, and all the methods advocated were based on the requirements of the facts. The Sichuan and Kangding provinces have vast territories, complex ethnic groups, and local conditions that vary from place to place. What one has may be what the other lacks (for example, drug prohibition). One may be considered excessive, while the other may be considered insufficient (for example, the powers of officials below the county magistrate). The inspection group respected the facts, and the promotion committee followed suit. What exists should not be omitted, and what does not exist should not be fabricated. Therefore, after opening the book, one may inevitably feel that it is messy, which is different from general plans that are based on theory and are brilliantly prepared. This should be stated first. The source of the information in this plan has some value that is cherished by people. Those who read this plan should pursue its origin one by one, otherwise, they will not understand its intention, or even suspect that it is moaning without being sick. Therefore, it is necessary to first check the overview of opinions listed in Chapter 3 of Section 1 of the report, and then check the original text of the report according to its annotations. Then the source is clear, and there is no fear of being superficial when judging. This should be stated second. This plan is rich in content and the clues are inevitably more complicated. If it is resolved and passed and implemented by the government one by one, it would be a great blessing. However, what we hope for is in the major points. Those that are sufficient to establish the foundation of construction, or sufficient to constitute obstacles to construction, we hope that the government will make wise decisions and resolutely promote or reform them. Then all difficulties will surely be solved easily. Furthermore, considering that laws cannot be implemented by themselves, and that there are people who govern before there are laws to govern, the issue of the selection of personnel who implement all policies deserves special attention. The Council members deeply know that the government has a painful intention in employing people, but at the same time, they deeply believe that the government's employment of people will never leave obstacles to the progress of reform for the sake of temporary and tactful compromises. The Council members are more willing to add two points: (1) This case focuses on the construction of Sichuan and Kangding, but the methods advocated in the case and the facts on which they are based are not unique to Sichuan and Kangding. If the government believes that it is necessary for general provinces to adopt them, it is hoped that the implementation will not be limited to Sichuan and Kangding; (2) Browsing through the inspection report, it is all-encompassing. All the records are rare anecdotes that are difficult to obtain at ordinary times. Often, the facts of a certain time and place contain the blood and tears of countless people, and the life of the nation and the nation is attacked. However, it is not entirely recorded in the proposal. It is hoped that the authorities of various ministries and commissions will take the inspection report and read it as a strong reference material. The colleagues feel the heavy responsibility of the rear area in the War of Resistance, the urgent call of the people, and the urgent need for local construction. They sincerely hope for this. The content of this proposal is divided into (1) Administrative Organization, (2) Military Service, (3) Finance and People's Livelihood, (4) Public Security, (5) Economic Construction, (6) Drug Prohibition, (7) Education, (8) Yi Affairs, (9) Judicial Part of the Sichuan-Kangding Border Area.

<h3 id="e42">Finance: Gold Prices Plunge After Rising Amid Rumors, Reaching a High of 380 Yuan in the Morning, Selling Frenzy Leads to Closing Price of 4,000 Yuan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold dark market situation suddenly became huge again. It was exceptionally strong in the early morning, but tended to fall sharply in the afternoon. As a result, it plunged by 190 yuan. Initially, it was believed that the signing of the truce agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union and Mongolia was unfavorable to China, so it opened sharply at 4,300 yuan in the morning. Pawnshops were selling, and it once recovered slightly to 4,270 yuan. Later, due to the tight and soft foreign exchange, the buying frenzy was stimulated, coupled with the special efforts of Hong Kong traders, it reached a high price of 4,380 yuan. Subsequently, rumors arose frequently, and foreign exchange gradually strengthened, so a selling frenzy was triggered. Pawnshops continued to sell, and some securities firms and gold shops also followed suit. The trend immediately turned downward and soon fell back to 4,105 yuan. At noon, the situation stabilized and closed at 4,330 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was still flat, opening at 4,315 yuan. Before long, a rumor suddenly spread that a British bank was spreading that Britain and France would declare war on Soviet Russia. At the same time, a foreign telegram relayed the news that former Finance Minister Song Ziwen had suddenly flown to Moscow, and this news was feared to be related to the peace between China and Japan. Other rumors abounded, coupled with the continued easing of foreign exchange, causing people's hearts to change. More bulls came out to sell, and pawnshops, gold shops, and securities firms all scrambled to sell. Although Hong Kong traders still showed good demand, they came forward several times to pull up the price, but in the end, due to the constant stream of selling positions, it was difficult to compete with them. As a result, the market fell to a low price of 4,000 yuan at the close. Only after the close did it rise back to 4,050 yuan. Trading was very active, with a volume of 3,000 taels. The pawnshops' gold rose first and then fell, ultimately reducing 20 yuan. The customs gold and other prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunged by Slightly Less Than 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the news of the Soviet-Japanese agreement initially stimulated the buying frenzy, and a certain money exchange took the lead in releasing orders to buy, resulting in a strong opening in the morning. A certain money exchange bought 20 taels of cash gold at 4,300 yuan, which was about 40 yuan higher than the outside market the previous day, and 110 yuan higher than the afternoon closing price last weekend. After the opening, pawnshops and others came to sell, immediately reducing the price by 30 yuan. Pawnshops sold 20 taels each to money exchanges and other firms at 4,270 yuan. At that time, the tightening of foreign exchange aroused a buying frenzy, and retail investors competed to buy endlessly. In addition, a certain pawnshop and a certain money exchange vigorously promoted the Hong Kong traders, although a certain Yu firm frequently came to sell, and the pawnshops also had intentions, they took the opportunity to raise prices, soaring upwards. Before long, the price rose by another 110 yuan. A certain money exchange bought 10 taels from a securities firm at 4,380 yuan. After that, the buying demand from outside traders weakened, and the rising trend was frustrated. Pawnshops and cash gold shops continued to sell, and immediately fell back to 4,340 yuan. After a while, it briefly raised to 4,360 yuan. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange had eased, and retail investors turned from buying to selling. At the same time, many bulls from securities firms also came out, so it fell back by 55 yuan. Money exchanges mutually traded 30 taels at a price of 4,305 yuan. At noon, it rose slightly again. A certain money exchange bought a total of 30 taels from other firms and cash gold shops at 4,330 yuan as the afternoon closing price. The opening in the afternoon was still flat, 15 yuan lower than the afternoon closing. A certain gold shop sold 10 taels to a money exchange at 4,315 yuan. At that time, the air of peace was quite strong, causing people to feel empty-hearted. Securities firms and pawnshops competed to sell, and the market situation was extremely chaotic. In an instant, it was reduced by 115 yuan to 4,300 yuan, and there were no buyers. At that time, the Hong Kong traders suddenly entrusted a certain money exchange to vigorously buy more than 300 taels, and rebounded upwards, immediately rising back by 90 yuan. A certain money exchange bought 30 taels from other firms at 4,290 yuan. But suddenly it was heard that foreign exchange had eased, and the selling frenzy intensified again. Buyers all stood by and watched. A certain gold shop, pawnshops, and securities firms competed to sell each other, and before long, the price plunged by 160 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at 4,130 yuan. After that, Hong Kong traders started another buying frenzy, and once again returned to 4,200 yuan. After entering, because many retail investors came to close out, and the buying demand from outside traders weakened, coupled with the fact that sellers were eager to sell, the price tended to fall again. Before long, it fell by another 200 yuan. Cash gold shops sold a total of 30 taels to pawnshops and money exchanges at 4,000 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it plunged by 190 yuan compared to last Saturday, and 200 and several dozen yuan compared to the outside market the previous day. It was heard that a certain money exchange came to buy again after the close, and the price was raised to 4,050 yuan. The price fluctuated by 380 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was 10 yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Was Also Reduced by 20 Yuan</p>
<p>At first, the pawnshops' jewelry gold was still suspended at 430 yuan per tael, but at 9:35, it was raised by 10 yuan. At 2:00 p.m., it fell back by 5 yuan, and after a while, it plunged by 10 yuan. At 2:20, it plunged by another 10 yuan. At 2:35, it rose back by 5 yuan. At 3:00, it was reduced by 10 yuan again. There were no changes after that. As a result, it was reduced by 20 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tong Heng changed the suspension to 410 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng to 408 yuan, and the purchase price must be 20 yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Foreign Currencies Fell Sharply in the Afternoon <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies initially showed a strong trading momentum due to the signing of the truce agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan. The U.S. dollar bill was raised to 15 yuan and 8.5 jiao, but by noon, it had retreated to 15 yuan and 4 jiao. In the afternoon, the news that Song Ziwen was going to the Soviet Union was highly valued by the general public. The gold market was the first to bear the brunt, and the decline was quite severe. Therefore, British and American gold pounds also fell sharply, resulting in a decrease of 5 yuan each.

The Korean bill only rose by 5 li, and the other currencies were still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Discount Rate Declines <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>

<h3 id="e45">Foreign Exchange Market Sharp Decline in the Afternoon <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The unofficial exchange rates for British and American currencies saw expanded fluctuations. The overall trend subtly shifted from tight to loose. Initially, due to the signing of the Nomonhan ceasefire agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, Chinese merchants rushed to buy, and Japanese firms followed suit, aggressively absorbing currency. This caused the British gold price to fall to 3 shillings 9.375 pence at one point, and the US dollar to weaken to 6.25 yuan. Later, because Chinese banks and Japanese banking circles successively sold off, the underlying trend shifted to loosening. At noon, the rate recovered to 4 shillings 0.15625 pence for British gold and 6.4375 yuan for the US dollar. In the afternoon, foreign news reported that Soong Tzu-wen had flown to the Soviet Union, and there were rumors of a peaceful resolution. As a result, Chinese merchants urgently shifted their focus, selling off holdings, and Japanese banks continued to sell. Consequently, the market continued to loosen, with British gold dropping to 4 shillings 0.9375 pence and the US dollar to 6.625 yuan. The closing prices were 4 shillings 0.78125 pence and 6.53125 yuan, respectively, slightly higher than before. The situation after closing was even looser, with foreign banks' buying price for the US dollar reaching 6.6875 yuan. The trend for this month's futures contracts was similar to that of the spot market.</p>
<p>British Gold Once Reached 4 Shillings</p>
<p>Early morning saw no new cables from London with significant deals, nor follow-up prices from New York. The London spot gold price remained unchanged. Exchange rates for the British currency against the US dollar, Shanghai currency, and French franc remained flat. The US dollar against the British currency and Shanghai currency also remained unchanged, and decreased slightly against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices for bank spot transactions were 4 shillings 0.3125 pence for British gold and 6.5 yuan for the US dollar, with no change from the previous weekend. After opening, due to the signing of the Nomonhan ceasefire agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, Chinese merchants rushed to buy, and Japanese firms also followed suit. Chinese merchants and Japanese firms bought spot British gold at 3 shillings and 9.6875 pence, and spot US dollars at 6.4375 and 3.225 yuan from foreign banks (Mercantile, Chase). When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax announcement also showed no increase or decrease. Subsequently, the selling prices from foreign banks were at their highest, once quoted at 3 shillings 9.375 pence for British gold and 6.25 yuan for the US dollar, but there were no transactions at those levels. Later, there were sudden rumors of a peaceful resolution, so the buying spree stopped abruptly, and Chinese banks began to sell. At the same time, foreign banks' willingness to sell increased. American banks such as Chase sold spot US dollars at 6.375 yuan to foreign firms. A certain bank absorbed spot British gold at 3 shillings 9.6875 pence and 4 shillings, and spot US dollars at 6.4375 yuan from Chinese banks. Later, Japanese banking circles also began to sell British gold, but HSBC had a good appetite for it. Japanese banks sold spot central gold at 4 shillings and 0.3125 pence to foreign banks such as HSBC. The process then stabilized, and at the noon closing, bank spot selling prices were 4 shillings 0.15625 pence for British gold and 6.4375 yuan for the US dollar, slightly tighter by 0.015625 pence for British currency and slightly weaker by 0.0625 yuan for American currency, compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Selling Spree Intensifies, Market Trend Reverses Sharply</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to a variety of negative news, Japanese banks continued to sell off, and Chinese merchants also began to sell. In addition, foreign banks' appetite was not good, so the situation continued to loosen. Japanese banks (Cheng Jin) and Chinese merchants sold spot British gold at 4 shillings 0.3125 pence and 0.9375 pence, and spot US dollars at 6.5 yuan and 5.625 yuan to foreign banks. At the time, banks' buying price for the US dollar was at its highest, once reaching 6.625 yuan. By the evening closing, bank spot selling prices were 4 shillings 0.78125 pence for British gold and 6.53125 yuan for the US dollar. This month's rates for British gold closed at 4 shillings 0.46875 pence, and the US dollar at 6.46875 yuan. As a result, both spot and forward rates were looser by 0.046875 pence for British gold and tighter by 0.03125 yuan for American currency, compared to the previous weekend. It was heard that after closing, a certain bank absorbed spot US dollars from Chinese merchants at a high of 6.6875 yuan, but the selling price was requested at 6.5625 yuan.</p>

<p>Report from the Public Exchange: The stock market is relatively weak. The Soviet army's entry into Poland is feared to add more troublesome factors to the already chaotic European situation. However, the price decline was quickly halted, and the market trend stabilized at the closing. The market is not short of buyers, and they are willing to absorb stocks released by generally impatient and oversensitive investors at relatively low prices. Jardine Matheson textile shares fell rapidly, reaching a low of 18.2 yuan, but the trend immediately improved and returned to 18.8 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Yarn and Cotton: 5,000 Bales of Common Cotton Traded, Market Prices Similar to Last Weekend <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The sales of local cotton are booming, due to the manufacturers' preference for its bright and jade-like color, thus promoting healthy intake. However, the source from Northern Jiangsu is very congested, with a total of more than 5,000 bales arriving at the docks in the past two days, making this the first large arrival this year. All available stock was sold out, and the selling prices were similar to the previous day. The current situation of cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>In other news, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai is drying up, and the factory side has a great need for cotton. Thus, the selling price continues to be high, but there is no goods to meet the demands. Therefore, some factory sides have started to order new cotton, all of which will be shipped in September and October, and will arrive in Shanghai in mid-December. Yesterday, various rumours were rampant, and traders intended to temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude, and therefore turned slightly silent.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: New York cotton market has been quite weak in recent days. First, overseas merchants dumped sales, and also triggered long positions to close. Later, due to short selling in the south, the market conditions have not been able to turn firm from beginning to end, and therefore failed to be revitalized. Until the closing, the market price fell by seventeen or eight pounds compared to the previous day. India has risen sharply for many days, and only slightly showed a small decline yesterday. Including forecasts, it fell by six rupees compared to the previous day. The Egyptian Liverpool Exchange is closed.</p>

<p>The spot market for cotton yarn had no market due to the cessation of meetings. Although foreign merchants had intentions to buy, the holders demanded high prices, so the negotiations could not be settled and no transactions were made. However, the North China Tianjin merchants believe that they have not bought goods for a long time, and have some appetite for yarn and cloth. Therefore, a few packages were traded, with market prices up 10 to 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Afterwards, after 4:00 PM, it was heard that gold suddenly began to fall, and there were also unfavourable rumours in the market. As to how the situation will be resolved must wait for the market to open tomorrow before a final decision. Today, 140 bales of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Rice</p>
<p>Various sources from the lower reaches of the river arrived in Songjiang and Nangang around the 13th and 14th, and nearly 10,000 packages of goods arrived by wheel in Jiaxing, Jiashan, Kunshan, Fengjing, Jiangjian, Wuhu, etc. With the surge in arrivals, people's hearts were weary, and coupled with continuous rain, there were few customers in the trading center. Thus, traders had no choice but to depreciate prices to sell, and the market showed a downward trend, which became increasingly intense. As a result, thick rice fell by more than 3 yuan compared to the previous week, and the prices of the various new high-quality rice also fell by more than 1 yuan.

<h3 id="e56">No Development on the Defense Area Issue, Situation in Western Shanghai Still Serious, Many Rumours in the City, Difficult to Verify, Concession Authorities Consider and Respond Cautiously <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiations on the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries and the Japanese side's request to adjust the defense area, many rumors have been circulating for days, but it is difficult to verify. This morning, it was widely rumored in the city that the British defense area north of the Suzhou River had been transferred to the Japanese side. This newspaper inquired from various parties, but it was difficult to obtain definite news. The British Embassy also denied the matter. In order to investigate the truth, this reporter personally went to the north bank of the Suzhou River to observe at 2:00 AM this morning. The sentry posts on the Tianhou Palace Bridge and the Garbage Bridge were still on duty as usual. The Tian Tong Road and Suzhou River Road area was quiet because it was late at night and in a state of curfew, so no police or patrol officers were seen. At that time, the area was quiet and there was no unusual phenomenon. In addition, it was rumored that the police power of the Great Western Road had also been transferred to the puppet "City Government". However, according to this newspaper's investigation, it is known that yesterday was the 9/18 Anniversary, and in order to avoid conflicts, the police reduced the number of patrols and there was no other intention. However, the concession authorities are responding cautiously to the current situation. The news obtained yesterday is described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>No Proposals Yet for Adjusting Defense Area</p>
<p>According to well-informed foreign sources, on the 13th of this month, Japanese Marine Corps Commander ______ Hu convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, American, and Italian forces stationed in Shanghai. The purpose was to seek the consent of the commanders of various countries to adjust the defense areas of the forces stationed in Shanghai. However, during the meeting, the Japanese side did not propose a specific adjustment plan, and none of the commanders present had any intention of proposing a specific plan. So Commander ______ Hu of Japan stated that if the countries agreed, the Japanese side would propose a specific proposal as the basis for future discussions. However, as of now, the Japanese side has not yet submitted a plan, and it has not been able to reach a compromise with the British side. The United States is willing to be the backing of the United Kingdom, and has repeatedly stated that it does not want to change the status of Shanghai. The firm attitude of the responsible officials stationed in Shanghai has made Japan wary and unable to rashly add military pressure. However, under the current circumstances, it is very possible for Japan to intensify its use of political tactics in an attempt to obtain greater rights and interests from the concession, such as the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries. Although it is not true that the patrols of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the area of road construction beyond the boundaries in western Shanghai have automatically withdrawn, as claimed by the Japanese newspapers, the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries will eventually be resolved in ten days or half a month. As for the rumors that Japan will block the British defense area from the North Jiangxi Road to the North Xizang Road, it is feared that it is due to a misunderstanding. The Japanese side wants to take over the British defense area of ​​Section A (North Section) of North Jiangxi Road, but the British side has not agreed, so there is such a rumour.</p>
<p>Checking Commuters and Vehicles</p>
<p>Obstacles were placed on Haige Road in the area of road construction beyond the boundaries, such as the Yuyuan Road intersection, the Jing'an Temple Road intersection, the Great Western Road intersection, and the Foch Road intersection, leaving only a narrow entrance for entry and exit. More than ten Chinese and Western detectives and members of the International Volunteer Corps were stationed at each location, checking commuters and vehicles very strictly. From Difeng Road to Xujiahui, such as the Foch Road, Itingpan Road, and Xiafei Road intersections, Chinese and Western detectives were also stationed, and an armored vehicle and a patrol car were patrolling the aforementioned areas. However, the side door of the Lin family mansion at 448 Haige Road was closed yesterday, and only the main door was used for entry and exit. Six puppet policemen were stationed at the door, and the situation was more serious than before.</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps Patrolling Roads Beyond Boundaries</p>
<p>From Haige Road to Anhe Temple Road on the Great Western Road, Volunteer Corps members were constantly patrolling in military trucks. Three puppet police officers were stationed at both ends of the Fahua Bridge, checking pedestrians very strictly. In front of the puppet police substation at the Columbia Road intersection, there were originally two puppet police officers guarding, but yesterday it had been increased to six. At the staff dormitory of Shanghai Commercial Bank at 1760 Jing'an Temple Road, six puppet police officers were still stationed, and the situation was the same as before, with no major changes. At the entrance of the Shining New Village in the Siming Villa on Pingyuan Road, there were originally two puppet police officers guarding, but yesterday it was reduced to one. However, at the Qianjia Alley intersection opposite Yuguang Village, the number of puppet police officers stationed had increased to eight, and the situation had become tighter.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Penetrate Into Brenan Road</p>
<p>The two places between 1249 and the opposite Ivans-Tai Dance Hall are the staff dormitories of the Japanese-owned Toyota Yarn Factory. There were no puppet police officers stationed there before, but yesterday two people were also sent to guard them. At the Brenan Road intersection of Zhaofeng Park, six puppet police officers were suddenly found to be stationed yesterday morning, and all commuters were surprised to see it. Recently, the police have dispatched fewer police officers to patrol, but yesterday they specially increased patrols, and armored troops also patrolled from time to time.</p>
<p>Triangular Area Completely Blocked</p>
<p>The situation in the triangular area at the intersection of Jassfield Road and Avenue Haig on yesterday was even more tense. All entrances and exits were almost completely blocked by barbed wire. A large number of Italian soldiers and Chinese and Western detectives were stationed there, leaving only a small gap for commuters to pass through, while vehicles of all kinds were not allowed to pass. Therefore, the No. 7 bus had to be diverted. The inspections of commuters were extremely strict, and the situation was very serious. Barbed wire was set up at the Jiaozhou Road Xinzha Road intersection, the Robert Sheng Road intersection, and the Kangnaut Road Yanping Road intersection. More than ten Italian soldiers and Chinese and Western detectives were stationed there, and the guard was also very strict. The defense in the Caojiadu area was quite lax yesterday, and even the puppet police were not seen much. There were only a few sentry police officers. However, the buses on the upper roads and the trolley buses on the 16th and 19th could not drive straight to Wujiaochang, and the situation was even more deserted.</p>
<p>Restriction of Businesses in the War Zone or Approaching War Zone</p>
<p>In order to maintain the original organization of profit-making legal entities in the war zone, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated temporary measures for maintaining the status quo of profit-making legal entities during extraordinary times and announced them for implementation. The measures stipulate that profit-making legal entities in the war zone or approaching the war zone shall maintain their original status. The convening of shareholders' meetings and the re-election of directors and supervisors shall be postponed. The original directors and supervisors shall not be relieved of their responsibilities during the postponement. The purpose is to prevent traitors from interfering and causing the businesses to be destroyed. Since its implementation, it has had considerable success. However, it only maintains the inherent organization of profit-making individuals, and has not uniformly restricted the transfer, mortgage, or change of the rights and interests of various businesses. The scope of use of its assets and restrictions on entering into joint ventures with foreign merchants have not yet been stipulated, and it is still insufficient to maintain and protect the energy to the fullest. After presentation to the Executive Yuan, approval was granted to stipulate five measures for restricting various businesses in the war zone or approaching the war zone.</p>
<p>1.  The changing of the names of various fishery rights holders and mining rights holders or the transfer, mortgage, or change of their rights and interests, as well as the changing of the names of forestry contractors, state-owned mining rights lessees, or those who have obtained special business rights, shall all be submitted to the Ministry for approval. All those that have not been approved are invalid.</p>
<p>2.  The premises and equipment of various farms, forest farms, pastures, fish farms, mining farms, factories, or companies, and the real estate invested in them, shall not be used for other purposes or mortgaged to others without being submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>3.  The transfer or mortgage of shares of various companies or the changing of shareholders' names shall all be reported to the Ministry for record. All those that have not been reported to the Ministry are invalid.</p>
<p>4.  Various companies shall, in accordance with the law, fully deposit the public reserve fund in each term. All accumulated public reserve funds shall not be withdrawn or used without being submitted to the Ministry for approval, and shall be deposited in national banks. Those that have been deposited in registered commercial banks or local banks and are inconvenient to change the deposit shall also be submitted to the Ministry for approval and record.</p>
<p>5.  All contracts or deeds entered into by various companies or other business organizers or representatives with foreign merchants regarding rights and interests shall be invalid unless approved by the Ministry. In addition to having sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice and Administration to forward to courts at all levels for notification, it has also been ordered to the construction halls of various provinces to implement the same.</p>
<h3 id="e57">9/18 Anniversary: Citizens Passed It Steadfastly, Public Concession More Heavily Guarded, Northwest Area Traffic Shortened, Alert Lifted Today <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The public concession's defense deployment was cancelled within the national defense zone at 7 pm last night due to the good situation. At the same time, the mobilization order for the national defense forces and the Volunteer Corps of the International Volunteer Corps was also revoked at that time. As for the Police Department's curfew on the roads and the barriers and traffic restrictions, they were not removed until 11 pm last night and normal conditions were restored. However, armored cars continued to patrol, and the detective's inspection work along the way did not stop. The above-mentioned dynamics are fixed work on the police, so they are implemented even on weekdays, and the implementation is more strict after the curfew.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 8th anniversary of the fall of the three northeastern provinces. The police authorities of the Public Concession were deeply concerned about the occurrence of unexpected unfortunate events, so they took the necessary precautions a few days ago, including searching famous hotels, increasing patrol teams, and inspecting pedestrians. From the afternoon of the day before yesterday, they adopted the emergency measures that had been taken in the past, sealing off the intersections connected to the French Concession, setting up barriers, and cutting off traffic. The only roads that could pass were Sichuan Road, Dongxinqiao Street, Yuqiaqing Road, and Seymour Road, but these places were densely populated with detectives. The bridges on the Suzhou River were also closed. The Yuqiaqing Road Bridge was completely closed, the Zhejiang Road Bridge was only allowed to vehicles, the Fujian Road Bridge was only allowed to pedestrians, the Shanxi Road Bridge was also completely closed, and the Henan Road Bridge was allowed to both vehicles and pedestrians.</p>
<p>The No. 5, 6, and 7 tram lines stopped at the entrance of the Special No. 1 Court because the iron gate at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Avenue Haig was closed. The No. 18 trolleybus detoured to Beijing Road to reach the boundary road. The Wushi Police Station was more strictly guarded in view of the bombing case of the Inner River Shipping Company on August 13. Entertainment venues such as dance halls and amusement parks automatically closed for one day. Only one or two businesses were open. The French Concession was more relaxed. Armored vehicles still set off from time to time to patrol, and the Public Concession Corps was only fully prepared. The order was peaceful throughout the day, and there were no disturbances until the evening. It is heard that the precautions will be lifted this morning, and all the blocked places on the roads will be opened. However, ordinary precautions will still be implemented as usual, and the western Shanghai area will also be closely guarded as before.</p>

<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the new Japanese military commander stationed in Shanghai, Major General Miura, met with British Consul-General Phillips, American Consul-General Gauss, and Shanghai Municipal Council Director-General Phillips this morning (the 18th) to pay courtesy visits.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Rumor of Song Ziwen Flying to the Soviet Union Causes Financial Market Volatility: Foreign Exchange Loosens, Gold Falls, Government Bonds Rise, Unrelated to China's War of Resistance Economy <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai financial market after the occupation has shifted its center inland and is unrelated to the economic foundation of the war of resistance. The black market for foreign exchange is the center for the Japanese and puppet regimes to obtain foreign exchange. The black markets for gold, securities, etc., are places for speculative merchants to stir up trouble. Moreover, due to the government's lack of power, import and export trade cannot be controlled. The flow of goods in the occupied areas is no longer</p>
<p>comparable to the pre-war normal state.</p>
<p>Most of the foreign exchange trading in the market is not for legitimate needs. Open trading of gold is a violation of the government's policy of prohibiting the purchase of gold. Therefore, the value of legal tender in Shanghai can no longer represent the</p>
<p>Chinese legal tender</p>
<p>that is the foundation of the war of resistance in the southwestern provinces.</p>
<p>Yesterday, rumors arose in the Shanghai financial market, causing extreme fluctuations in foreign exchange, gold, and securities. The reason was a United Press report that Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, had flown to the Soviet Union. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired in the market yesterday: (1)</p>
<p>Black Market for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The HSBC Bank quoted prices remained unchanged, but the actual market was slightly tighter in the morning and suddenly loosened in the afternoon. The British exchange rate was 4.0625, and the US exchange rate was 6.5625. (2) The black market for gold rose slightly in the morning, closing at 4,330 yuan, and</p>
<p>fell sharply in the afternoon,</p>
<p>closing at 4,000 yuan. (3) In the black market for securities, the unified bonds fell slightly in the morning and rose again in the afternoon. At the close of the afternoon, Class A was 51.4 yuan, Class B was 44.3 yuan, Class C was 43.5 yuan, no transactions were made for Class D, and Class E was 43.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Methods for Transporting and Selling Silk: Clearance Based on Licenses and Certificates <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that silk goods transported from Shanghai to various places are often detained by inspection agencies due to unclear sources and national origins of raw materials, leading to disputes. Similar incidents of silk goods being detained have also occurred in Chongqing. The Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance and related agencies and organizations, has discussed and determined handling methods.</p>
<p>For previously detained silk goods, if there are certificates from the Shanghai Silk Industry Association and customs distribution licenses, they will be allowed to be returned. For silk goods transported to Chongqing in the future, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association should provide accurate certification. The certificates should clearly state the country of origin, marked quantity, original tax payment receipt number, date, and name of the silk weaving factory. The above methods have been instructed to the</p>
<p>Industry Association</p>
<p>to comply with, and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. Subsequently, the Yuan submitted the proposed suggestions of the China National Industry and Commerce Association for review. Regarding the domestic manufactured rayon fabrics repeatedly being seized in various places as mentioned in the suggestions, the Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance, has drafted plans to refer to the Shanghai</p>
<p>transportation of silk goods,</p>
<p>decided on the original plan, and telegraphed to various provincial governments instructing local competent authorities to allow customs distribution licenses and industry association certificates to be inspected and released. The approval was granted as proposed. In addition to distributing the information, the information should be telegraphed to the public for awareness. Ministry of Economic Affairs, Business, Printing.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Printed Fractional Currency Notes to be Issued Soon; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance Again to Expedite Release; Rumors of Reprinting New Currency are Untrue; Tram Fare Vouchers Should Not Be Used Elsewhere <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank temporarily suspended the issuance of fractional currency notes, various companies and firms have indiscriminately issued their own printed fractional currency notes, and counterfeit cases have been discovered, leading to a gradual worsening of the problem. Small businesses are facing extreme difficulties, and the livelihood of the common people is greatly affected. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, deeply aware of this, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, stating, "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, the fractional currency notes have not yet arrived, making it difficult to find change, greatly affecting the livelihood of the common people. Please immediately print and issue them as per the previous telegram. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully. " It is heard that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, due to sample drafts being leaked, temporarily suspended the issuance for the sake of caution. The head office has instructed the Hong Kong office to negotiate with Wing On Company nearby and thoroughly investigate the cause of the leak. It is heard that the negotiation is nearing completion, and the leaked sample drafts have been identified as few in number, so it has been decided to reissue the already printed fractional currency notes in the short term, but whether to add a stamp is still undetermined. Rumors of reprinting new currency are untrue.</p>
<p>Tram Fare</p>
<p>Vouchers are Lacking</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank suspended the issuance of fractional currency notes, various shops in the city have successively issued fare vouchers to provide change. However, recently counterfeit vouchers have been rampant and are often refused. Merchants have switched to using the tram company's fare vouchers to maintain exchange, leading to a great demand for the tram company's fare vouchers, with a total issue amount reaching over 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Company Advises</p>
<p>Not to Use for Other Purposes</p>
<p>It is learned that the British-owned tram company in Shanghai has recently found that its fare vouchers are widely circulating in the market, causing ticket sellers to lack change and encounter many obstacles. Yesterday, it issued a notice to passengers, stating, "Tram fare vouchers can only be used on trams. Please advise residents not to use them elsewhere. This will greatly help our company's ticket sellers and provide more assistance to customers in finding change. Please cooperate to the best of your ability."</p>

<p>The five flat-price rice sales locations in the two concessions, with 8,000 bags of tribute rice, temporarily suspended flat-price sales yesterday due to a notification from the concession authorities that yesterday was the 9/18 Incident Memorial Day and a state of alert was in effect. However, civilians from all walks of life were not informed in advance. At 7:00 AM yesterday, they still carried baskets as usual to the nearest flat-price sales locations, waiting for the doors to open to purchase tickets and collect rice. After the guards learned of this, they rushed to explain the reason for the temporary suspension of flat-price sales and advised them to return home. It was decided that flat-price sales would continue as usual today. Upon receiving this news, the disappointed civilians returned home. Yesterday, the doors of the five flat-price sales locations were tightly locked, with only one or two staff members managing the remaining items and stationery.</p>
<p>Continue Flat-Price Sales</p>
<p>as Usual Today</p>
<p>The five flat-price sales locations in the two concessions have decided to continue flat-price sales as usual today, still from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The rice and grain that should be sold at each location today have been arranged yesterday. It is expected that the order at each location will improve today. According to a survey of those in charge of the flat-price sales locations, the five flat-price sales locations have sold a total of 1,856 bags and eight dou of West Saigon rice in the past two days. There are still 6,143 bags and two dou of tribute rice remaining, including 1,000 bags of broken rice. It is learned that these will be sold out on the 23rd and 24th of this month. A second round of flat-price sales is still being planned, which will greatly benefit the common people.</p>
<p>Group Registration Approaching Deadline</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Group's entrusted registration of foreign rice to the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association has been underway for two weeks. The response from all sectors has been enthusiastic. As of 3:00 PM yesterday, registrations have reached over 14,000 bags. According to the person in charge of the Certified Public Accountants Association, the various groups decided to handle the foreign rice registration and entrusted the association to handle it on their behalf. Now the registration deadline is approaching. All sectors that wish to jointly order foreign rice should come before the deadline. After the total amount is compiled, it will be reported to the groups to facilitate ordering and transportation to Shanghai for regulation.</p>
<p>National Rice Arrives in Abundance; Prices Slightly Lower</p>
<p>The source of rice and grain in the city has gradually become abundant recently. Yesterday, seven boats arrived from the river, totaling 1,167 dan, and there were still 4,098 bags on the market. As for prices, due to the flat-price sale of foreign rice, poor families competed to purchase foreign rice, causing retail sales in rice shops to be deserted, and prices also contracted. Indica rice was down 1.5 yuan, with the best selling for 36.5 yuan to 25 yuan. Japonica rice fell 2 yuan, with the highest selling for 41 yuan. Early rice fell 1 yuan, with steamed buns selling for 35 yuan, and loose grain selling for 31-32 yuan.</p>

<p>Still Operating on Avenue Dubail</p>
<p>The Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai was originally located in the building of the Palace Hotel on Huangpu Road. After the Shanghai War, it was relocated to 100 Lane on Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. It was previously rumored that the Soviet Consulate General had suddenly received instructions from Moscow to move back to the old building north of the Suzhou Creek. After receiving the order, the consulate made repairs to the original building, but the person in charge of the consulate did not recognize the return to the old building. Regarding the rumors that the consulate general was scheduled to relocate on the 18th and had issued a notice, according to reports obtained on the 17th, the Soviet Consulate General does not intend to move back to the north bank of Suzhou Creek and will continue to operate as usual at 100 Avenue Dubail starting yesterday. According to a reporter, the consulate general is not planning to move back to the old building.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Rapid Development of Rich Resources in the Southwest; Strengthening the War of Resistance; The Rebirth of the Chinese Nation Has Already Taken Shape in the Interior <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the vast southwestern provinces of China, with exceptionally rich and undeveloped resources, are attracting increasing attention from the world, according to the Credit Investigation Agency Bulletin. Since the Central Government moved its capital to Chongqing, the southwestern provinces, with a total area of 1,520,015 square kilometers and a population of 117 million, have been developed into a strong base for China's war of resistance. Recent reports reaching the outside world have clearly demonstrated the abundance of</p>
<p>natural resources</p>
<p>in this virgin land. Under the protection and encouragement of the government, rapid progress is underway, and the realized development, the scope of which is so large that it would hardly have been possible without the current war. It is expected that more news of the great development of this part of China will be heard in the future. China's industrial and financial resources, as well as various talents, have been concentrated in the southwestern provinces, and it is widely believed that the rebirth of the Chinese nation is now taking shape in this great interior. The southwestern provinces, including Xikang, have various</p>
<p>abundant minerals.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the region contains a total of 13,270,000 tons of coal reserves, including 12,104,000 tons of bituminous coal and the rest anthracite. Under the leadership of the government, mining operations have been actively undertaken. Among the southwestern provinces, Sichuan has the largest coal reserves, with a total of 9,874,000 tons of bituminous coal. Yunnan is second, with 1,485,000,000 tons of bituminous coal and 11 million tons of anthracite.</p>
<p>Guizhou is next</p>
<p>with a total coal production of 1,549,000 tons, including 77.5 million tons of bituminous coal and 77.4 million tons of anthracite. Guangxi's coal reserves reach 44 million tons of anthracite and 11.3 million tons of bituminous coal. The richest coal seam in Sichuan province originates from the Jialing River in the center of the province and follows the river south to Chongqing. Mineralogists estimate that the seam contains a total of 49.1 million tons of bituminous coal, which is well-suited for producing high-quality thermal coal. The upper reaches of the Minjiang River also have abundant coal reserves, reportedly reaching 17.6 million tons. The coal mines in the area can be easily</p>
<p>transported elsewhere</p>
<p>via the Minjiang River. The coal reserves in southern Sichuan are estimated at 33 million tons, but transportation is inconvenient in the area, making mining efforts difficult. It is reported that Yiliang in Yunnan province has a total coal reserve of 17 million tons. Since the city is located on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, transportation is very convenient, and the coal produced is sold throughout the province. When the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway is completed in 1940, the coal from Xuanwei in northern Yunnan will be able to compete with the coal produced in Yiliang. It is estimated that the Xuanwei area has 33 million tons of coal. In addition to coal,</p>
<p>the southwest is also rich in iron</p>
<p>The iron ore of the Yangtze River is known for its 12 million tons of high-quality iron sand. Not far from Dianjiang, there are also large iron deposits estimated at 33 million tons. Near Luding in eastern Xikang, there are 17 million tons of iron sand. Many other parts of this remote interior have also discovered rich ore deposits, which are now awaiting development. Benefiting from its convenient location and the natural resources in its vicinity, Chongqing has now become the center of China's economic and industrial life.</p>

<p>Freighters from Trieste to Shanghai and India</p>
<p>The Italian shipping company's postal ships, including the "Vittoriano Contarini," "Conte Biancamano," "Conte Rosso," and "Giulio Cesare," operated between Italy and Shanghai, and their business was very prosperous. When the European war broke out, the company temporarily suspended operations due to fears of dangerous navigation. Subsequently, when the government announced neutrality, and there were no obstacles on the Eurasian route, the company's ships successively resumed operations. It has now been learned that the Italian headquarters decided the other day to resume the postal ship service from Trieste to Shanghai, as well as the freight ship service between India and the Far East. Although the Eurasian routes of the warring countries such as Britain and France have not been completely cut off, merchants and passengers are apprehensive, so the Italian shipping company's passenger and freight transport has become twice as busy as before.</p>

<p>In order to prevent manufacturers in the occupied areas of Zhabei and Hongkou from passing off their products as domestic goods and dumping them in the market, the Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Notification No. 33991 of the Ministry of Economic Affairs states that all domestic goods certificates issued before the Ministry revised and promulgated the rules for issuing domestic goods certificates and the interim standards for domestic goods should be deemed invalid and reapplied for. This was telegraphed to you for notification last December. Regarding domestic goods manufacturers in the occupied areas who are still operated by Chinese nationals, if there is indeed any seizure of control or exploitation, their membership should be revoked, and their products should be banned. The Chamber of Commerce should also inform the Shanghai domestic goods manufacturers' organizations to promptly and thoroughly investigate and report to the Ministry for verification."</p>

<p>After the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was successfully tested by British ships, various ships successively set sail. However, the Japanese Navy suddenly announced the blockade of Wenzhou Bay starting on the evening of the 17th, causing the New An Lee ship to turn back after reaching Wenzhou. It is still difficult to predict whether the Shen You ship, which sailed out on the morning of the 17th, will reach its destination. After the German ships Mou Fu and Hanna on the Shanghai-Ningbo route returned to Shanghai, the Hanna ship was scheduled to sail to Ningbo as usual on the 22nd, but the opening date of the Mou Fu ship has not been determined. Two Japanese ships, Da Xin and Tenma, are transporting large quantities of Japanese goods and opium for dumping in Likang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Shipping Route</p>
<p>Suspended Again</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was successfully tested by the British ship New An Lee and returned smoothly to Shanghai, various ships, such as the British ships New Xiang Tai, Shen Fu, and Shen Ai, successively tested the route. However, the Japanese Navy suddenly announced on the evening of the 17th that it would resume the blockade of Wenzhou Bay, causing the route to be blocked and suspended again. The New Xiang Tai of Tai Chang Xiang and the Shen Ai ship of Yi Long Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday with cargo from Wenzhou, but will no longer sail in the future. The New An Lee ship of Weili Han Company was intercepted by a Japanese warship outside the port after making a second decision to sail to Wenzhou and was unable to enter the port. It has already returned to Shanghai on the original ship and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Also, the company's Shen You ship sailed to Wenzhou on the morning of the 17th. It is still difficult to predict whether it can reach the destination to load cargo. The Wing Tai Marler ship of the Far East Shipping Company was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou today, but has now decided to change its route to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Hanna Sells as Usual, Moufu Undecided</p>
<p>The two German ships, Moufu and Hanna, operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, returned to Shanghai from Zhenhai one after another. According to reports, the situation along the way was quite safe, so the two ships still intend to operate as usual to maintain traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency who inquired at the Far East Company, the Hanna ship is scheduled to sail to Ningbo as usual on the 21st (Thursday). However, the opening date of the Moufu ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm has not yet been determined. Also, the German Haifu ship will return to Shanghai within days, and the Depp ship of the Zhongyi Company is scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the 22nd. If the cargo cannot be loaded in time, it will be changed to leave Zhenhai the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Dumped in Likang</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the shipping industry that Likang is a small island in the Zhoushan Islands with a population of over 1,000 households. It is located more than 30 li from the Zhenhai estuary and can be reached by small ferry in one hour. The island has been under the jurisdiction of the Dinghai County Government. Since the fall of Dinghai, the area has been in a state of anarchy, with only 30-odd members of the local self-defense force. The Japanese Navy occasionally lands there, but quickly retreats. Currently, two Japanese ships, Da Xin and Tenma, are sailing back and forth from Shanghai, transporting large quantities of Japanese goods for dumping. The Chinese military and police are unable to exercise their authority there. It is also learned that sailing ships are transporting large quantities of drugs from a certain direction, which are also landing there and then being transshipped elsewhere. Therefore, Likang has become the tail end of Japanese goods and drugs. It is heard that the Ningbo Defense Command is paying close attention to this and prohibits all ships sailing from there to Ningbo from entering the port to prevent Japanese goods and drugs from entering.</p>

<p>Arrested, Tried, and Awaiting Sentence</p>
<p>Li Ziming, a Shandong native and Chinese constable No. 774 of the Joint Savings Society Hongkou Police Station, colluded with two fugitives at around 5:00 PM on June 8th of this year to break into and rob the Youli cigarette exchange store at 1297 Yu Garden Road with weapons. The owner of the store sneaked out to report to the police for encirclement and arrest. Li opened fire to resist arrest, but was outnumbered and shot in the leg, falling to the ground and being captured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. Now that Li's injuries have healed, he was sent to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the Special First Court yesterday morning, and a public prosecution was filed against him for robbery and murder. Judge Xiao ascended the seat for trial and concluded the case, ordering the defendant to be returned to custody pending sentencing.</p>

<p>Since opium dens have sprung up in the suburbs of Shanghai, and opium smoking dens have been opened in large numbers, the concession authorities have strictly ordered a crackdown. However, those who defy the law still smuggle drugs into the concession for sale from time to time in the hope of making huge profits. It is heard that at noon on the 16th of this month, a rowing boat in the Huangpu River was intercepted and searched by Western customs officers because its actions were suspicious. Eight large bags of opium, totaling 800 taels, were seized. The two boatmen and three smugglers, Zhang Xiaorzizi, Cai Shun, and Wang Shou Kang, were arrested and sent to the court for investigation.</p>

<p>Chinese constables No. 1663, No. 1228, and No. 2457 of the Gordon Road Police Station were patrolling in the area of Connaught Road and Jessfield Road at 7:15 PM on the 15th of this month when they were suddenly surrounded by a group of about fifteen thugs, each armed with a box cannon, who ordered them to remain silent and robbed them of three handguns and eighteen rounds of ammunition they were carrying.</p>
<p>After the police station received the report, they dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, who, together with the Italian troops in the defense zone, made arrests without success. At 9:15 PM on the 16th, the armored vehicle team of the Gordon Road Police Station was passing near Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road when Zhang Asan, who was acting as a lookout for a gambling den in Caojiadu, reported that three Anhui natives, Wang Xiusheng, Wang Jinlong, and Tao Jinquan, were the bandits who robbed the gambling den. The search team</p>
<p>of Chinese and Western Detectives</p>
<p>arrested Wang and others, took them to the police station, and interrogated them. They confessed that they were related to the robbery of the three Chinese constables' handguns on Singapore Road on the 15th of this month and admitted that they were responsible for acting as lookouts at the time and were invited by a fugitive leader named Gu Deshan. They also directly admitted to robbing a gambling den of hundreds of yuan worth of property. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court, and the police lawyer filed a lawsuit against them for robbery and requested detention.</p>
<p>Rescheduled for Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>Subsequently, the three Chinese constables sued and clarified the process of being robbed of their handguns at the time, pointing out that the defendant Tao Jinquan was present at the scene. When questioned, the three defendants overturned their confessions at the police station, admitting that the robbery of a certain gambling den in Caojiadu had occurred. Judge Jiang Yan ordered them to be returned to custody after verification and rescheduled the hearing. It is also learned that the three defendants in the case were employed by a self-defense group under a certain organization. On the orders of "Captain" Hu Deshan and "Squad Leader" Jiang Yutian, they were to borrow money from Yi Ji, a</p>
<p>flower association lottery factory</p>
<p>run by Mao Axiang and Li Xiaobao, but were mistaken for thieves by the lookouts of the gambling den and were arrested.

<p>Jin Daoyi, a Nanjing native and Western medicine doctor residing at 77 Yongyu Lane, West Gate Road, previously served as a military doctor in Liu Duoquan's 105th Division. In 1931, he met and cohabited with Shen Ju, a dance hall girl, in Shanghai. Soon after, they had a daughter named Yin Gui, who is now ten years old. However, three years ago, Shen Ju ran away with the girl without informing Jin due to disagreements.</p>
<p>This spring, through the introduction of a friend, she obtained a price of 500 yuan and sold the girl to Wang Shen, a woman from Huzhou at 166 West Gate Road, as an adopted daughter, renaming her Yue Mei. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 15th of this month, Wang Shen accompanied Yin Gui to buy vegetables at the vegetable market in West Gate Road when they were suddenly spotted by Jin, who was passing by. He went forward,</p>
<p>grabbed her, and reported to the police.</p>
<p>After the police chief's investigation, Wang Shen was ordered to leave with the girl, and she was deemed free of suspicion. The case was transferred to the Second Special District Court yesterday, where Judge Zhu interrogated the parties in the Eighth Criminal Tribunal. Wang Shen confessed that she adopted the girl at the time through the introduction of relatives and friends, with a voluntary adoption agreement written by her biological mother. She also hired attorney Chen Chou to defend her, stating that it had been reported that the</p>
<p>biological mother of the girl, Shen Ju,</p>
<p>had been sentenced to 30 days of detention by the First Special Court in a rice scam case involving Zhao Xixi, who was involved in performing slapstick shows, and is currently in custody, so she requested that she be brought to court for questioning to clarify the truth.

<p>The autumn rain in the city is continuous and incessant, and the climate is becoming increasingly cool, making it appropriate to wear lined clothing. It was also found that the high tide issued at 2:53 AM today in the Huangpu River measured ten feet, nine inches, and three points. The high tide at 3:25 PM measured eleven feet, one inch, and six points. Tomorrow's high tide at 3:33 AM will measure nine feet, four inches, and two points, and the high tide at 4:15 PM will measure ten feet, zero inches, and three points. At that time, the roads will have tidal water emerging from the sewers. Also, according to the astronomical observatory records, yesterday's highest temperature dropped to 71.4 degrees, and the lowest was only 65.1 degrees. The west wind was blowing tightly all day, and the cold air was solemn. Also, a new typhoon in the Pacific Ocean had reached 16 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, heading due north, with winds within 120 nautical miles. Also, the air pressure in the city has been trending higher since last night, so the weather is expected to clear up today.</p>

<p>Zhuo Cihui, a 34-year-old native of Ningbo who operates a stock and securities business at No. 253 Zhao Zhu Jiao Road, drove his private car with license plate number 11918 on the afternoon of August 1st, passing in front of No. 677 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, and struck and killed a Cantonese woman named Chen Lishi. He immediately paid 2,000 yuan in damages. However, the French police arrested Zhuo for manslaughter and transferred him to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution according to law. The initial trial sentenced him to two years in prison and released him on bail pending review. Zhuo refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Zuo Sui and others to appeal to the Higher Third Branch Court. After deliberation by the collegiate panel, it was decided to add a 1,000 yuan bail with a guarantor who would ensure his presence when summoned, and to set a date for sentencing. These details have been previously reported. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the Higher Third Branch Court, pronounced the judgment in the Third Criminal Court. Zhuo Cihui's sentence was changed to a fine of 1,800 yuan. If he chooses to perform labor instead of paying the fine, it will be calculated at a rate of six months of labor for the total amount of the fine.

<p>Both Parties Hold Conflicting Views - Sentencing Scheduled for the 25th</p>
<p>Yuan Xuting, the 33-year-old Ningbo native owner of Yongfeng Rice Store at No. 277 Great Rachel Road, recently hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court. He accused Hua Shunian (40 years old, from Zhenjiang, currently residing at No. 6, Lane 118, Huanneng Road), who was in charge of business at the Dongtai branch of the Bank of China, of breach of trust and embezzling a remittance of 5,000 yuan. He requested an investigation and also filed a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering repayment.</p>
<p>Regarding this remittance and the overdue 7% annual interest, the complaint states that on August 21st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the plaintiff sent Wei Baoxuan to Taizhou to entrust Jia Xusheng, the business director of the Taixian branch of the Bank of China, to remit 5,000 yuan to Shanghai. At that time, the defendant, Hua Shunian, the business director of the Dongtai branch of the Bank of China, was present and needed the funds for use. Jia Xusheng obtained Wei Baoxuan's consent and handed the funds over to Hua Shunian, who agreed to deliver them in Shanghai on time. The defendant received the funds and issued a formal receipt as proof.</p>
<p>Later, Dongtai fell, and the branch of the Bank of China moved to Shanghai, and the defendant also came to Shanghai to work. For a year now, he has delayed delivering the entrusted remittance of 5,000 yuan. Despite repeated reminders, he has used excuses to delay, and his actions border on embezzlement. The plaintiff requests an investigation and the recovery of the remittance. After receiving the complaint, Judge Sun Pengham conducted a hearing. The defendant requested a postponement to gather evidence, which was granted. These details have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the case was heard again. The plaintiff and his lawyer were present.</p>
<p>They restated the previous situation.</p>
<p>The defendant, Hua Shunian, and his lawyer, E Sen, were present. Hua admitted to receiving the 5,000 yuan from Jia Xusheng but claimed it was part of other transactions. He stated that he had paid two checks totaling 8,000 yuan on February 18th of the previous year. After arriving in Shanghai, he had met with the plaintiff several times to settle accounts, but without success. He also presented the check numbers and account names as evidence. The witness, Wei Baoxuan, was also summoned to testify about the circumstances of the remittance. After hearing the arguments, the court adjourned the hearing and scheduled sentencing for the 25th.</p>

<p>Zhu Huishan (36 years old, from Zhejiang), owner of Sanxing Paint Store (No. 5, Lane 140, Jiaotong Road, Shandong Road) and the Mianfeng Weaving Factory, also serves as the manager of Shunxing Foreign Firm and Futai Paint Store at No. 1514, Wenlin Road, Avenue Joffre. Recently, his wife, Zhu Wang Rongti, hired lawyer Zheng Lintong, citing intolerable abuse as the reason, to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting a</p>
<p>judgment ordering separation</p>
<p>for two years, monthly alimony of 150 yuan, or a one-time payment of 3,600 yuan, and requesting the return of 1,200 yuan in cash deposited in Sanxing Paint Store (with interest at 1%, as promised by the defendant). The court approved the complaint, and Judge Tao Dejun conducted a hearing in the First Civil Court yesterday. The defendant himself did not appear but hired lawyer Du to represent him. After Judge Tao took his seat, the plaintiff, Zhu Wang Rongti, testified that she had been married to the defendant for 17 years and had</p>
<p>one son and one daughter.</p>
<p>The daughter's name is Xuemei (16 years old this year), and the son is Yangsheng (14 years old). They used to live with their children in their hometown. The defendant conducted business in Shanghai. Last January, due to the chaos of the war, they brought their children to Shanghai to take refuge and stayed at the Zhongzhou Hotel. Suddenly, a woman came to the room looking for Zhu Huishan, claiming to be his wife. I immediately scolded the defendant and asked who she was. The defendant said that the woman's name was Qian Zhenbao, a former dancer, and that he had taken her as a concubine and rented a house at No. 159, Henan Road to live with her. At that time, the defendant was afraid that I would investigate further and</p>
<p>wrote a letter of repentance,</p>
<p>vowing to break off relations with Qian Zhenbao within two months. My mother-in-law also interceded and gave me 1,000 yuan in cash, which I deposited in the Bank of China as mental compensation. Because of my mother-in-law's persuasion, I endured in silence. Later, the defendant used the excuse of interest rates to trick me into withdrawing all the bank deposits and depositing them in his own store, without paying me the principal or interest, and did not fulfill the letter of repentance. He even forced the plaintiff to take her children to live with his</p>
<p>concubine at No. 159, Henan Road.</p>
<p>For the sake of peace, the plaintiff lived in the same house with Qian. Who knew that the defendant would listen to slander and often beat the plaintiff? On the early morning of the fourth of last month, she was instigated by Qian to be beaten for asking for pocket money. The court's forensic doctor has examined the injuries. Please ask the court to review the case files. Then, her daughter, Xuemei, and son, Yangsheng, testified in court about their father's beatings and requested that their grandmother and uncle be summoned to testify. Finally, the defendant's representative, lawyer Du, stated that the defendant admitted to beating the plaintiff and requested that witnesses be summoned for questioning. The defendant opposed the separation and requested that the plaintiff's suit be rejected. The court reviewed the statements and ruled to summon witnesses for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (1) - Continental European Unified Control Policy <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) Professor Qiu Youzheng of a domestic university recently wrote an article entitled "Overview of Teacher Education in Various Countries," in which he elaborates on the trends in teacher education in European, American, Japanese, and Russian countries. Here are some excerpts. We study modern teacher education by referring to seven countries: Germany, France, Italy, England, the United States, Japan, and Russia. There are three trends: (1) Germany, France, and Italy in continental Europe follow a "unified control policy," with extremely strict restrictions on teachers in primary and secondary schools, regarding teacher training colleges as places for teacher certification preparation; (2) England and the United States follow a "laissez-faire system" where educational undertakings are mostly established by non-governmental organizations, local governments, or private individuals, and teacher training is no exception; (3) Japan and Russia, one focusing on the emperor and the other aiming for a communist society, regard teacher training as a tool for implementing national policy, and can therefore be generally termed "instrumentalism." These three approaches have influenced or implied implications for teacher education in China. The evolution of teacher education in China has gone from independence to dependence, and now from dependence to independence. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was roughly modeled after Japan, with national higher normal schools and provincial normal schools, as well as teacher training institutes and vocational teacher training schools. In addition, there were separate women's and men's normal schools of equal standing. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), a new school system was implemented, and teacher education changed with the six-three-three system. The standards may have been raised, but the spirit of specialized teacher training was implicitly abolished. Provincial normal schools became part of senior high schools, and most national higher normal schools were upgraded to ordinary universities, with only a faculty of education established. This was also a result of the American school system. Currently, Chinese education is stirred by the currents of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. The education authorities deeply recognize that teachers at all levels of schools bear a great responsibility and that they cannot fulfill their mission without personal, scientific, and specialized training. Therefore, national teacher colleges are being established, and teacher education zones are being planned. Our hope, of course, is to create a system that suits China's actual needs, without simply copying from the East or the West, and to lay a permanent foundation for national role models and moral educators, without the phenomenon of frequent changes. Therefore, how are the current conditions of teacher education in various countries? I think those who are concerned about and study teacher education will want to hear about it. I will now describe the situation in each country below.</p>
<p>Unified Control Policy in Continental Europe</p>
<p>The Jena campaign was the key to the development of teacher education in continental European countries. When Napoleon defeated Prussia, the German philosopher Fichte vehemently called for national awakening, urged the government to quickly seek educational reform, and advocated sending students abroad to study Pestalozzi's educational spirit and methods. Later, these people all became principals of normal schools. By 1825, German teacher education had independent facilities and a solid foundation. France already had achievements in teacher education during the Napoleonic era, but it was not until the Minister of Education Guizot took it under direct state control and required each county to set one up, that the year was 1832. European countries, after this stimulus, all began to engage in operations and regard the training of teachers as one of the special rights of the state. This concept has indeed become a fashion of the times.</p>
<p>(1) France - Primary education in France is the most developed. National elementary schools are required to be set up in each village, regardless of the population, one for boys and one for girls if the population is over 500. Therefore, the training of teachers is also relatively evenly distributed. The current system is based on the decree of 1879, which stipulates that each county should set up one normal school for men and one for women. Therefore, there are currently 88 normal schools for men and women, with only one or two exceptions. The entrance qualification is the level of a general course in a higher elementary school, because the middle school in France has a seven-year course, which is connected to the elementary school. Therefore, the age is 15 to 19 years old. Entrance requires an examination, and there is also an examination at the end of each academic year in the school. In the final academic year, they should practice in their affiliated primary schools. The courses taught include educational psychology, sociology, education, ethics, and philosophy. The decision includes French and literature, history and geography, foreign languages, and teaching. Also, physics and natural history, hygiene, homework, housework, (women) and drawing, sculpture, and geometric drawing, singing, music, and gymnastics are all subjects taught every year. There is also a short time for agricultural theory, and a lot of time for manual work and agriculture, but passing the graduation exam only gets you a high school exemption certificate, and you can serve as an intern educator. After two years of experience, when you are 20 years old, you will be reviewed again. If you pass the test, such as the actual teaching experiment, and the test of education, management, school operation, and practical educational problems, you can get a teacher's certificate of competence, but those who have not fulfilled their military service obligations still do not have this right. Those who obtain this certificate can be employed as full-time teachers. After that, there is still room for free development in the education field.</p>
<p>There are two types of middle schools in France, one is national and the other is locally established. In addition, normal schools and higher primary schools are also in the middle education process. Therefore, there are also two types of teacher training: Higher Normal Schools, one is the secondary higher normal school, the male school is located in Paris, the female school is located in Fossell, and the study period is three or four years. Students are recruited from the two middle schools mentioned above, and they are trained to become teachers in the two middle schools mentioned above. One is the elementary higher normal school, the male school is located in Stcloud, and the female school is located in Fontenayaux roeee. The main body is to recruit graduates of normal schools, the study period is two years, and they are also trained to become teachers in normal schools and higher elementary schools. However, graduates of these two higher normal schools are still test sites in schools. The qualifications are determined by the test. France still cannot immediately obtain the official qualifications of teachers. They still have to go through the test, and the teachers of national middle schools must obtain the title of "Examination and Appointment Professor." The so-called examination and appointment professor must come from the examination. The qualification for the examination is generally those who have a master's degree. Each year, the Ministry of Education calculates the needs of Lycees and holds public examinations. There are eight items: philosophy, literature, grammar, history and geography, foreign languages ​​(English, German, Italian, Spanish, or Arabic), mathematics, physics and chemistry, and even natural history. The so-called secondary higher normal school is of course the standard place for this kind of test.</p>

<p>After Chu Minyi resigned from the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, the Ministry of Education has telegraphed Nong Ruhui to act as the president of the institute. It is rumored that the French side suddenly intends to close the institute or merge it with Aurora University. The entire student body was greatly shocked by the news. In addition to planning to send representatives to petition the French ambassador, yesterday they telegraphed the Ministry of Education to fight for it. The original telegram is extracted as follows: Chen Junjian, Minister of the Ministry of Education of Chongqing, after the former President Chu Minyi resigned, your ministry has telegraphed Mr. Nong Ruhui of this institute to act as the president, and all the students in the institute are deeply pleased. Now we hear that the French side intends to close the institute or merge it with Aurora, which is shocking. We check that the establishment of our school is based on the Treaty of Versailles. Now the French side alone advocates changing the organization, which is not only self-destructive, but also damages our national rights. The students must resolutely oppose it in order to respect national rights and safeguard the school, and vow to fight to the death. The school must not affect the studies of all students and the life of the school due to Chu's personal relationship. The new order of your ministry has been issued, and everything should be maintained as it is. Now the French side is taking this opportunity to invade the school, which is not only burying the glorious history of this institute, but also conflicts with the central government's decree. I think your ministry will be able to refute it with reason. The students also firmly oppose it in order to obey the central government and maintain the history of the school, and vow to be the backing. It has been unanimously decided by the whole body (1) to absolutely support the central government's appointment of several generations of presidents (2) to absolutely oppose any attempts to close or merge, etc., to harm national rights and destroy the school. In addition to petitioning the French ambassador, the matter involves treaty obligations and national sovereignty. In Shanghai, which is under occupation, it is related to international perception and public opinion. We specially appeal, please maintain the status quo and do not allow any attempts. All the students of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology kowtow</p>

<p>It has been found that there is a "Shanghai Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society", which has not been registered by the education authority, and has been publishing advertisements in various newspapers and periodicals to recruit students for free, teaching Chinese and Western medicine. However, there is already an organization of the "Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society" in this city, and the society is obviously borrowing the name to deceive the public. It is learned that the Ministry of Education has issued Order No. 20434 on August 26th of this year to ban it. The original text is extracted as follows: "(Omitted above) This ministry has recently received a report from Song Daren, the managing director of the "Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society", stating that recently someone else organized the "Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society" (address: No. 11, Lane 282, Tongfu Road) with the same name as the society. It is extremely similar and publishes newspapers to recruit students, requesting a ban. The "Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society" was approved by this ministry for filing in August of the 24th year. The organization of the "Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society" has not been approved by this ministry for filing, which is not in accordance with the provisions of Instruction No. 894 of the 20th year of this ministry.

<h3 id="e91">Not Defending Critics <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xi</p>
<p>The transformations in the literary world are truly numerous. There was a period when critics specialized in criticizing writers. Later, writers joined forces with non-writers to criticize the critics. Until recently, this situation has become less heated.</p>
<p>The underlying reason is roughly this: Some writers, due to the "slander" of critics (whether it is "slander" or "setting up slander" is still a question), although living in such a great era, ended up withdrawing their literary works and waiting, waiting for an opportunity for critics to also produce creative works, so they could also criticize. If they waited long without seeing any works, they would also scold: "You say this article is not good, this article is too bad, but you yourself can't write a single good piece for people to read!" Critics seemed to understand this point, so they only shouted "no works," and they were determined to be scolded by writers and "never produce anything." Writers had no choice but to sigh and walk away.</p>
<p>Truthfully speaking, unless a writer's work is "hidden in famous mountains to be passed down to future generations," then he alone can appreciate it himself, or boast about it himself. People (readers and critics) will definitely not say "not good" or "too bad," and even if they want to say it, there's no way to say it. But the era of "hiding in famous mountains" has long passed, and they also feel that they are eating animals, and they cannot starve themselves and sing high-sounding praises all day long. So they can only put their works into society. Once they enter society, they have value, which is a commodity, and immediately become "copyrighted." If someone is willing to offer a price to buy it, then they have at least paid a price, and they seem to have the right to say good or bad. In this way, "criticism" is truly a sin that writers should endure. In fact, if writing a work is said to be "unpleasant" because it has been criticized a few times, it is a bit too much. I think that being criticized is not without benefit to the writer. Saying it's good can make the work spread more widely, and saying it's bad can also let the author know their shortcomings, as long as the critic is honest (without bias) and the author is humble!</p>
<p>Of course, writers resent critics partly because critics sit high in the literary world and look down on everything, leading to situations of random criticism and slander. But this should not lead to throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and the essence of criticism should not be erased because of this one point. Moreover, in my opinion, incorrect "random criticism" cannot be "immortal," and someone will definitely refute it soon. But now, some writers have withdrawn their works because of the criticism of critics, with the intention of leaving the literary world blank. However, such silence and inactivity are not beneficial to the literary world!</p>
<p>The criticism of critics is considered "slander" by writers, but third parties may think it is the most appropriate judgment. The problem is that writers should not take "my own writing is the best" as the ultimate truth, because critics cannot falsely point to a prostitute and say, "She is the greatest hero in the world!" just because the writer is someone they know and want to get some good from them. Nor can they call a real hero a prostitute because of their dislike for the author.</p>
<p>As for writers putting down their pens and waiting for the critics' works, this is almost a joke. People have already used the analogy of cooks and diners, so I will skip it here.</p>
<p>I am not a critic, there is no need to defend critics, and there is no possibility of resenting creators. If I must state my position, then the above words are all the opinions of an ordinary reader.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Squad Leader <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Shan</p>
<p>Long and sturdy, his chest was like a piece of iron, so hard and stiff, his face was covered with small red bumps. Not very lively, but extremely energetic, his eyes always stared at people's faces - I almost blushed from their gaze several times.</p>
<p>This was my squad leader during training, an eleventh-term recruit at the military academy.</p>
<p>He was fierce and unreasonable. When he glared and roared, "There is no reason in the army. If there is reason, the order is the reason!" we were frightened and hung our heads, because if we had a slightly unpleasant expression, his long legs would sweep over, which would make you hurt for a whole day.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had not forgotten that we were ultimately from "young master" backgrounds, (as he said) when we were doing hard field exercises, everyone showed a helpless expression and kept pulling at their grass-green wide sleeves to wipe sweat. He would say like an older brother, half mocking, half pitifully: "Look! How useless! When you go to the battlefield and 'lie down', you won't be able to get up! I'm telling you, sweat more in the training ground, bleed less on the battlefield... Hmph, take a break - about face, you should also release your 'water guns'."</p>
<p>He really liked to joke. When he was free, he would chat with us about everything, and he loved to ask if we had lovers. We asked him the same question, and he would smile happily and say: "Yes! Her name is Jin Cang - we will get married when the time comes, and I will have to hug her and sleep on the battlefield at night!"</p>
<p>The squad leader was from Jilin. When asked about "home," his jaw dropped a little, but he immediately raised it higher, and his not-so-lively pupils became more fixed, and his chest became straighter. Apart from the dry words "Changchun," he didn't say anything else. At other times, when he was happy, he would tell himself that he had done unprofitable business on Xiaobai Mountain (he smiled when he said it), and he had been taught by ghosts (he sneered when he said it)...</p>
<p>"For justice, for survival, for freedom, war should not be avoided." When we disbanded in August of last year, he said excitedly, "My wish to enter military academy can also be fulfilled."</p>
<p>"Will we ever see each other again?" I asked mournfully inexplicably.</p>
<p>"Why not?" he roared. "In Jilin!"</p>
<p>"I'm not from Jilin!"</p>
<p>"You are Chinese," he looked at me warmly and smiled lightly. - I really can't forget that bright smile.</p>
<p>In the past two years, he and his lover must have already gotten married, and they must have a "child," fulfilling the squad leader's wish of "marriage," I thought.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Are the Germans Really Not Afraid of Defeat? (Part 2) <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Fritz Sternberg, Translated by Zhu Jijun</p>
<p>Geographically speaking, France may achieve a brilliant victory in this war, but at the same time, many people in Germany also believe (as they did in 1914) that they can achieve a superior victory within a few months. However, in the West, Germany is facing a country whose industrial level is also very high (although in some production sectors, it is behind Germany). It can technically, chemically, mechanically, in the air, and with poison gas, contend with Germany. Therefore, it is impossible for Germany to calmly achieve a military victory in the West. Thus, in the West, there are neither industrial nor military conditions that can enable Germany to achieve a brilliant victory. In the East, there are even fewer of these two good conditions, and even the geographical conditions are lacking.</p>
<p>Therefore, judging from a purely military point of view, the Second World War will be a long-term war - unless the masses of the people come out to stop it. A long-term war is the greatest danger to Germany's National Socialist rule, because as the war drags on, those factors that gave Germany some military advantages in the early stages of the war (the mobilization of the entire military industry) will, in turn, poison it.</p>
<p>If Germany had used its productivity to the fullest when the war started, then later it would not be able to increase its production significantly, because it would soon reach its peak, and thereafter, productivity would begin to decline, and would decline sharply at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a country has a very outstanding peacetime productivity in the years before the outbreak of the war, even in the years of military expansion, then it still has a lot of room to work hard during the war, and greatly increase the productivity of its military industry. At the same time, the peak of productivity can be reached later, and the rate of its decline can also be slightly slower. However, Germany is not like this.</p>
<p>Unless German fascism wins quickly, it will not be able to win at all, because due to the long-term development of anti-government tendencies in Germany, the rate of productivity decline (which will come as the war drags on) will increase dramatically. The Second World War will be a long-term war, and National Socialist Germany will not wait for the end of the war and will be reduced first.</p>
<p>When Hohenzollern Germany plunged into the whirlpool of the Great War, it was only prepared militarily and did not plan economically in advance. It had economic weaknesses and was defeated. The Allied countries won because of their superiority in steel, iron, and food.</p>
<p>Fascist Germany is seeking lessons from the Great War. It is simultaneously building a military and an economic general staff to plunge into the vortex of the Second World War, and it will simultaneously plunge into the vortex as a fascist country. Only that.</p>
<p>However, merely having a military and economic general staff cannot win a war. The support of the masses of the people is also necessary. But now, most of them oppose National Socialist rule, although this opposition is latent and secret.</p>
<p>If the war drags on for a long time, then Himmler's prediction, that in this Second World War, a civil war will inevitably occur in Germany, will be terribly fulfilled.</p>
<p>How long can Hitler support the war?</p>
<p>Only enough to support a fierce war.</p>
<p>But not long enough for the long period required by the Second World War.</p>

<p>What counts --</p>
<p>One's own fate!</p>
<p>No need for decadent music,</p>
<p>No need for moaning without illness,</p>
<p>Only anger and furious flames,</p>
<p>Burning the bloody soul,</p>
<p>Ringing out loudly.</p>
<p>I want to run --</p>
<p>Towards those distant mountains and ridges,</p>
<p>To leap,</p>
<p>To lurk,</p>
<p>Give play to the instinct of justice,</p>
<p>I do not wish</p>
<p>In a narrow world,</p>
<p>To shrink and survive.</p>
<p>The distant base camp,</p>

<h3 id="e96">After a Thousand Calls, She Finally Appears: Song Dezhu to Perform on Stage the Day After Tomorrow <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Nan Tiesheng stopped performing "Golden Shackles" yesterday (the 18th). After Tiesheng finished performing, the authorities of the Golden Theater originally intended to invite the female performer Zhang Eyun to take the stage next, to perform for a few days, while waiting for Song Dezhu and other Peking opera performers from Xiao Kelaishen, who had been invited long ago but were blocked by the floods, to arrive, and then give up the stage. Now, since Song Dezhu and his party arrived in Shanghai a few days ago (the 17th) on the Shuntian Wheel, Zhang Eyun's plan to perform at the Golden Theater after Nan Tiesheng has become a pipe dream.</p>
<p>This time, the Golden Theater invited Song Dezhu, Yang Baosen, Wu Yanheng, and other large groups of Peking opera performers. I have introduced them one by one in this newspaper. Now, it is known that in addition to the people who were invited before, Yuan Shihai and Ci Shaoquan have also joined and came with Song Yang and others.</p>
<p>Yuan Shihai once came to Shanghai with Shang Xiaoyun, but he failed to leave a deep impression on the people of Shanghai. In fact, Shihai's art is worth mentioning. Shihai specializes in the painted-face roles in Peking opera, and he is an outstanding talent from the fifth class of Fu Liancheng. During his time in the class, he secretly studied with his eldest brother, Hou Xirui. All of Hou's masterpieces, such as "Ding Zishan at the Famen Temple," "Mu Kezhai," "Puqiu Mountain," and "Stealing the Imperial Horse," are all Shihai's specialties. After leaving the class, he was invited by famous actors such as Shang Xiaoyun and Xiao Cuihua, and his art was further developed by secretly imitating Hao Shoushen after Hou Xirui. Shoushen was known as the "Living Cao Cao" in the old capital, because Shoushen's performance of Cao Cao was so realistic. Shihai's white-faced plays are modeled after Shoushen. Over time, he has also become full of Hao's style. All of Hao's masterpieces, such as "Huang Yidao," "Peach Blossom Village," and "The Trial of Li Qi," are well-received by Shihai. Recently, Shihai has even joined Shoushen's school and become Hao's disciple. Shihai's voice is not very powerful, but his rhyme is full. His stage presence can be said to be beautiful. Although he has joined Hao's school, his art is actually close to Hou's, and Shihai learned a lot from Hou when he was in the class. I think that Shihai should take the essence of Hou and Hao and combine them into one. With Shihai's talent and good foundation, his future is unlimited if he can do so. Ci Shaoquan is the son of the famous comedian Ci Ruiquan. He has followed Cheng Yanqiu south several times. His acting is conventional, neither greasy nor slippery. He has the style of his father, but Shaoquan has never been popular and has always been in the position of a supporting actor. This time, he is going south, and perhaps he can show his talents.</p>
<p>Song Dezhu, Yang Baosen, and others are scheduled to take the stage at the Golden Theater starting on the 21st. Song Dezhu's three-day performance schedule has been slightly changed from the previous one. The first day will be the complete "Xin'an Post Station," which is a secret book of the old Narcissus Flower, which is different from the one performed by Mao Shilai before. The second day is "Water Flooding Jinshan Temple," which is Dezhu's masterpiece. Huang Liushuang invited Dezhu to shoot this play into a film and take it to the United States for screening. The third day is "The Great Heroine." Since Song Dezhu left the opera school, she has shown her sharp edge. Her popularity in Beijing is not inferior to that of the famous Western dan. This is her first time going south, and it is difficult to predict whether she can appeal to the audience. However, Song and his party are mostly excellent talents from the opera school and Fu Liancheng. Although they are young talents, they are all rising stars, and it is expected that they will give the people of Shanghai a new look.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Two Major State-Run Film Studios in Chongqing Have No Worries About Film Stock <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Filming work is not affected</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the source of film stock has been greatly affected, because the products of the German Agfa factory are in danger of being cut off. Although there are still a few stocks currently, the ships of the warring countries have been transferred back to their countries for military use, so many difficulties have occurred in transportation, and the price has also risen several times.</p>
<p>Currently, the largest supplier of film stock is Kodak of the United States. Because the United States has not yet been involved in the whirlpool of war, it continues to produce in large quantities to meet the needs of the film industry in various countries.</p>
<p>In the past, the two major state-run film studios in Chongqing, "China" and "China Electric," have always felt that the source of film stock was not easy to obtain. Before the outbreak of the European War, transportation was already quite difficult, and the days were often delayed due to avoiding air raids, which affected filming work. After the outbreak of the European War, the outside world speculated that the source of film stock would be even more difficult. If the United States joined the war, the Kodak company would have no products to meet the needs, so not only "China Electric" and "China" would have no films to shoot, but also the film industry in various countries would be greatly affected. However, in fact, "China Electric" and "China" had already planned ahead. Currently, the Hong Kong factory of "China" has purchased and stored a large amount of film stock, and "China Electric" also sent photography director Zhou Ke to Hong Kong not long ago to negotiate on film stock matters, and he has also purchased a lot and temporarily stored it in Hong Kong. As soon as it is needed, it can be transported to Chongqing at any time. Therefore, at present, even if the products of Kodak in the United States are cut off, the film stock of the two major state-run film studios in Chongqing can still be said to be safe in the short term.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Young Musician Chen Gexin (Part 1) <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>- To Answer Questions for the New Capital</p>
<p>The young musician Chen Gexin has been in Shanghai for almost ten years, but he is still only twenty-six years old. He is so young, especially his youthfulness in the spirit of struggling for music. Gexin himself is very capable of writing articles. In the past, he has published many light and sharp essays in various newspapers. He does not have a very good background. He has gradually come to understand music through his own hard work and intelligence. Moreover, he is proficient in English, French, Russian, and other languages.</p>
<p>As for his family, his wife Jin Jiaoli is also a beautiful girl who can sing Western tunes. He has always been so indifferent. None of his friends have ever heard him say that Chen Bai, who was once popular in the Shanghai education circle, is his own brother, but the brothers have completely different interests and personalities.</p>
<p>He can compose, write lyrics, and play musical instruments. His songs, works, and performances are already familiar to readers in various films, theaters, and newspapers. And now, he is in charge of the "orchestra" and "song and dance group" of the "new song and dance" at the "New Capital Hotel" of the New New Company.</p>

<p>The unfinished part of "Women's Apartment," which was once suspended, will be reshot immediately and will be screened at the New Light Theater during the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Gu Youxiang's personally directed "Jing Ke Assassinating the King of Qin" is planned to start after "Wang Baochuan," but has not yet been determined; but Lu Xiaodidi, who is scheduled to play Qin Wuyang, has already signed a three-year contract with Xinhua Company.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Society will have an amazing performance recently and decided to "promote it heavily." The details will be known in the coming days.</p>
<p>Following "A Night Queen," Zhang Shankun will also direct a film starring Gu Lanjun. The script "The Red Thread Stealing the Box" is being written by a famous screenwriter.</p>
<p>Ticket masters Li Yunying, Bao Xiaodie, Gao Hua, Mao Jiahua, Zhang Guyu, and more than twenty others, launched the organization of a joint national opera dinner party, and held an inaugural meeting a few days ago. The purpose is to study the principles of drama, and it is heard that a joint party will be held every month.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Liu Qiong and Xia Xia Collaborate for the First Time <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Beni</p>
<p>"The Beginning of Man" was performed by the "Shanghai Drama Society" at the Grand Auditorium of the French Municipal Council last year. Due to the original author Ba Ruolai's bloody satire and delicate portrayal, it caused a sensation in the drama world after the performance. Later, Xinhua Company planned to film "The Beginning of Man." After several negotiations, it was finally successful. At that time, it was decided that Liu Qiong would play the male role (Zhang Bonan) and Gu Lanjun would play the female lead (Xiao Lilian). The film was named "The World of Gold and Silver" and was well received by the famous world after its release.</p>
<p>Recently, the "Shanghai Drama Society" has been performing at the "Xuan Palace Theater" for a long time. It was originally planned to re-enact "The Beginning of Man" with the original cast around the Mid-Autumn Festival, which was a month ago.</p>
<p>Later, it was said that Gu Degang, who originally played Zhang Bonan, could not perform due to circumstances, and Shu Shi? "Sunrise" is being performed vigorously, so he naturally cannot spare himself. In this way, the authorities of the Drama Society considered new candidates. At this time, Wu Yonggang, who was just in "Flowers Splashing Tears," was often in the Drama Society (because he was the director of "Flowers Splashing Tears"). So, after everyone discussed together, they thought of Liu Qiong in "The World of Gold and Silver." After discussion, there was no problem. As for the role originally played by Shu Shi, it will be played by Mao Yun, who played Zhao Shengzhai in "Shen Yuan." This is also a "well-deserved" arrangement.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Xia Xia and Liu Qiong have collaborated on the stage. Under the direction of the "exquisite and detailed" director Mr. Wu Renzhi, the performance results will probably be correct.</p>
