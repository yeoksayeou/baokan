<h3>巴爾幹局勢的剖視</h3>
<p>巴爾幹半島向來有世界火藥庫之稱，現在二决大戰進行業已二月，巴爾幹諸國雖然先後宣佈中立，然而她們眞能超脫於戰禍之外，確保其和平嗎？要回答這個問題，我們須先從歷史的發展來加以檢討。</p>
<p>當土耳其帝國强盛時代，巴爾幹半島盡在其覊縻之下。自十九世紀後，土耳其帝國國勢衰落，疆土分裂，形成許多小國，互相傾軋，互相歧視，直到一九一二年巴爾幹戰爭結束時，及一九一四年世界大戰爆發前夕，巴爾幹半島就在這種狀况過去，第一决世界大戰的起因之一，實由於巴爾幹諸小國彼此的仇視，復經各野心强國的煽動，遂一發不可收拾。</p>
<p>一九一八年大戰結束，巴黎和會產生了今日巴爾幹的局面。南斯拉夫國是舊日塞爾比亞的化身。包含有奧匈帝國的一部。希臘自一九二二年希土戰爭之後，國內情勢頗爲穩定。保加利亞及土耳其同是戰敗國，喪地辱國。而羅馬尼亞則是大戰結果的最大勝利者，她在巴黎和會中從俄國，匈牙利，保加利亞，獲得很好的油田，其新增的土地。幾等於原有國土之半。</p>
<p>現在巴黎和的已經成爲歷史的陳迹了。保加利亞對於現狀固無甚不滿，而俄國及匈牙利却隨時嘖有煩言。俄國。不論其在俄皇統治下，或是無產階級執政，對於被併入羅馬尼亞的比塞拉比亞，未嘗一日忘懷。匈牙利亦屢决宣傳說，其在羅馬尼亞的少數民族大受虐待，對其失地，始終寢食難忘。再，義大利自併吞亞爾巴尼亞以後，對於巴爾幹更有虎視耽耽之勢。</p>
<p>什麼能戢止匈牙利及蘇聯收回失地的企圖以及義大利的野心呢？這，便要提到新興土耳其主持下的巴爾幹協的國之成立和英土法互助公的之訂結了。巴爾幹協的國包括羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，希臘。及土耳其四國，於一九三四年在南斯拉夫京城簽訂互助協的。該的具有軍事同盟性質，苟有其他巴爾幹國家圖侵略此四國之任何一國，則此四國必聯合抵抗之。直到今日，此四國協的，在表面上頗多少維持了巴爾幹的秩序與和平。不過，如果羅馬尼亞一旦受到匈牙利，德國，或蘇聯的壓迫，巴爾幹協的的簽字國是吾能如的赴援呢？那就很難肯定的答覆了。所以，在現行局勢之下，單憑巴爾幹協的，實不足以維持巴爾幹的和平。</p>
<p>幸而上月十六日在土京安加拉另自英法土互助公的之訂結，那才大大地增强了東南歐的安全。該的第二條稱：「土耳其將援助協的國（英法）履行對羅馬尼亞暨希臘之保障。」在另一方面說，土耳其與羅希南三國旣然同是巴爾幹協的的簽字國，則事實上不啻將南斯拉夫一起拉入英法保障範圍之內了。再該的第三款稱；「關於巴爾幹之問題，英法土三國應預先互相咨照磋商」，已使土耳其把握着巴爾幹的鑰匙，而爲其仲裁者。所以在今日巴爾幹的局勢之下。英法土互助公的，實在是繼巴爾幹協的之後，穩定東南歐的最大因素。最近義大利與希臘交換文書，重申睦誼，以爲其成立巴爾幹中立集團的張本，可以說是直接爲阻遏德蘇勢力的侵入，而問接却爲英法土互助公的所促成。不過義大利早爲英法着一先鞭，如果妄以巴爾幹盟主自居，徒見其爲夢想罷了。</p>
<p>據昨天倫教電訉，德國航空部長戈林上將奉希特勒之命，將於本月七日前往羅馬，訪晤墨索里尼，提出建議，願在巴爾幹方面，與義大利合作，是德國對於巴爾幹也有很大的野心。又據莫斯科電訉，蘇聯將與土耳其重開談判。這樣看來，巴爾幹前途，變化正多，能吾不節旁生枝，卻未可豫料哩。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹組中立集團　阻遏德蘇伸展勢　各關係國進行外交接洽　義大利實居於領導地位</h3>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　據此問消息靈通人士所知、羅馬尼亞近頃發起擴大巴爾榦協商、（包括羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·希臘·土耳其四國）將保加利亞或甚至將匈牙利羅致在內、構成中立國集團、各關係國間、已由外交途徑開始接洽、南國駐保加利亞公使日前退國述職、會就此事與南國外交當局有所磋商、羅國駐南斯拉夫公使、亦曾奉召返國、與羅國駐巴爾幹半島各國使節會晤、所討論者殆亦此事、要之、此種中立國集團或將以義國爲中心、特至目前爲止、義國當局尚未與南國進行接洽、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間各外國觀察家談稱、義國正向多瑙河流域與巴爾幹半島各中立國積極活動、務期在義國領導之下、使各該國組成集團、質言之、義國乃欲組成强有力的中立國集團、以阻遏德蘇兩國向東南歐暨地中海東部擴展勢力、義國政府近與希臘國互換照會、重申睦誼、其用意亦在於此、但義國推進此項策略、定必遭遇重大困難、其中尤以羅馬尼亞國問題爲最難應付、緣匈牙利與保加和亞兩國對於羅馬尼亞、各抱領土要求、羅國旣所不甘讓步、彼此之間、自難成立持久的協定、此其一、蘇聯或有一日移轉其視錢、而向羅國貝薩拉比亞省有所行動、屆時羅國勢必起而抵抗、果爾、則此一呱呱墮地之中立國集團、亦必隨之瓦解、此其二、羅馬尼亞與希臘兩國均巳接受英法兩國所提供之保障、此與嚴守中立一項原則互相抵觸、亦爲組織中立國集團之障礙、此其三、此外、即以義國本身而諭、亦有一極大障礙難於解决、蓋在此决歐戰爆發之初、義國即已宜佈採取靜觀態度、因此隨時均有加入交戰國一方之可能、此在多瑙河流域與巴爾幹半島各中立國、自必爲之惴惴不安、而不願預先受有束縛、某某國方面甚至表示、義國一日不正式宣佈嚴守中立、即一日不能以嚴格的中立國目之、由是種種、義國外交當局或常放棄組織大規模中立國集團之意、而努力拉攏匈牙利·南斯拉夫·保加利亞·希臘各國、以與阿爾巴尼亞組成範圍較小成份較爲單純之集團而將羅馬尼亞與土耳其兩國擯賭局外、則以羅國所可引起之難題、已如上述、而土耳其則與英法、兩國訂有互助公的故也、一般人並謂、此項新集團一經成立、義國雖在事實上居於領導地位、但在表面則當避不以盟主自居云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英法聯合艦隊　現佔卓越優勢　德空襲計畫已證明失敗　西綫平靜僅斥堠隊活動</h3>

<p>東華麗都上海華人足球兩巨頭、今晨十時半會師逸園作西聯足球甲組賽、在本屆西人球隊凋零不振之時、麗都東華並峙首席、此戰之得失、實有關未來甲組之領袖、更影響及盃賽之聲勢、而麗都誕生以來、亦從未與東華一遇、故比賽旣屬重要、精彩亦在意中、故將爲抗戰以來、華人足球界之空前盛况、因勝負之重要、競爭勢將激烈、吾人鑒於以往申園時代之事故、則對於雙方球員、均宜出以極佳之運動員精神、實深期待、况麗都甚多隊員、固皆爲東華昔日之隊友也、</p>
<p>勝負得失之頂測、賈幼良謂一半一半、確非虛語、以前鋒論、麗都之精華爲孫許曹、而東華則戴萬賈、中綫孟義良蔣兆祥似較勝一籌、而蔡聲淼則亦殊有可取、陳洪光莊友仁老將經騐球術平均、較勝李義臣張林根、守門秦必高則無疑在陸鐘恩之上也、麗都後起之秀鄭通裕、守門技術、一致稱道、靑出於藍、年少英俊、技在陸上、但麗都未肯掖扶新進、亦殊可惜、故論機會麗都勝東華未必確具把握、萬象華君告記者、謂東華長力不如麗都、因練習不足、亦係實談、勝負之數、因之允當別論、固能會師結果、一團和氣、不分勝負、握手言歡、亦未始非吾人所希望也、</p>

<h3>金融　處滙鬆勢愈演愈烈　華商起而拋空　美金出九元關</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、趨勢濫鬆鬆無止境、酷肖滙價暴縮時之景况、港客帮等及國外頭寸、繼續巨額拋出、而本埠華商亦巳一反曩日作風、大肆拋空、致英金最鬆達五便士五六二五、美匯竟出九元大關、爲九元三一二五、創最近新鬆價、至其猛鬆緣因、本報曾屢加闡明、茲不贅述、惟前途殊難逆料、但預測下週初或再作一度盤旋、全日經過、初因海外美英匯兌、猛緊一分三七五、故晨開即呈英平美軟之象、旋有外電及美行來市續吐、加之華商翻空、價遂鬆達五便士半、及九元一二五、嗣以匯豐有利等略有吃進、回緊至五便士四〇六二五、與八元九六八七五、無如港電及華比等再來塞出、價又不支、竟達英金五便士五六二五、美滙九元三一二五量硬價、結果仍以英金五便士五六二五、美滙九元二五收盤、較上日英續鬆二一八七五、美又硬三四三七五、論期貨交易、做者尚多、但賣價顯巳與現貨平衡、然向外行結進、則仍稍形拔開、半天現期交易尚旺、</p>
<p>港帮拋塞亦湧</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近平遠縮〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫教生金呆定、滙兌英對美對法均平、對滬升二五、美對英跌一分三七五、對滬大三角、對法小七五、中央掛脾各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五便士三四三七五、美滙八元八七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃匯兌猛落之故、開後港電前來拋塞、加之華商猛烈拋空、且外行吃胃殊淡、致市勢頗鬆、美匯衝出九元大關、計港電塞予滙豐等外行現貨英金五便士四〇六二五及四三七五、同時華商吐予大通有利某行等本月份英金五便士三七五與四三七五、並本月份美滙由八元九三七五至九元〇六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後現貨又硬至五便士半及九元一二五、嗣因賣方鑒滙豐吃胃轉佳、一時暫懷觀望、致市勢一度回軟、英金曾緊至五便士四〇六二五、美匯亦回軟至八元九六八七五、旋以港電與華商等復起費風、且外行華比某行供塞頗力、故重趨鬆動、計華比某行與港電等售予外行及進口商現貨英金由五便士四三七五、長至五六二五、並現貨美滙由九元〇三一二五、鬆達二五、後某行又吐予同行有利現貨美匯九元三一二五、時巳午刻、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五便士五六二五、美匯九元二五、本月份英金五便士五四六八七五、美匯九元二一八七五、結果比上日現期英均鬆二一八七五、美俱硬三四三七五、午後週穴無市、</p>
<p>香港美匯略緊</p>
<p>香港四日電、今晨滙市開盤平平、英匯不動、美匯現貨緊一二五、爲二十四元八七五、申滙現貨降四元、爲二百七十六元、日滙現貨緊半元、爲一百零五元半、十一時三十分申匯現貨降一元、爲二百七十五元、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>外幣下降亦猛</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因外匯鬆動甚劇、烚赤猛跌、英美金鎊供給甚暢、英美金票殷當供塞猛烈、納胃疲弱、晨間美金票爲十一元三四角、自後逐步下降、午時降至十一元、晚間爲十元零九角穴分、昨市香港票法郎票荷蘭票安南票等俱乏需耍、均趨下降、坎拿大票·斐律濱票緊·隨美金票亦甚盧弱、日余票需要呆滯、微趨鬆動、晚市爲一元三角零三厘、朝鮮票供求稀少，市况穩定、晚市爲一元一角、昨日市價英美金鎊英金票俱降二元、美金票降叫角六分、香港票降一角一分、法郎票降一分、新加坡票降一角、安南票降一角五分、荷蘭票·羅比票俱降二角、坎拿大票降五角、斐律濱票降三角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>黃金又吿猛跌　連小四天共降二百餘元　照滙價撳低二十七十元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續演驚人跌風、蓋環境之不良、使金市欲回不得、然依匯價計算、尚撳低二百七十元之巨、此乃一般人心尚具多頭思想、故除港帮貫例不斷扒吸外、內中小額收買亦不乏其人、至半日吐出最多者、天津帮居首位、金號及證券帮先後代其脫售、晨開跌度尚微、此後因滙價暴鬆、金號等代津帮大賣、一跌四十元、惟未幾外滙告軟、再賴港帮及本地帮拖進、始聲度回高時、達三千五百九十元、但外匯終告鬆硬、津帮及當日浮多斬結、又傾瀉至三千五百十元、結果收盤爲三千五百二十元、因銀樓帮稍進故也、午後塲外復疲落達三千五百元關邊、半天成交暢旺、的一千五百兩之譜、銀樓飾金步小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>再瀉九十六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外匯續告硬化、致局勢仍不脫疲象、某金號首先撳價賣出、開市即做小十六元、某金號賣予證券帮三十兩、爲三千六百元、嗣回起五元、金號進錢兌業十兩爲三千六百〇五元、少頃買者寥寥、賣勢頓濃、金號與錢兌業競相憲出、逐漸做小三十元、錢兌業進現金號二十兩、爲三千五百七十五元、後經某銀樓拉提、會回至三千五百九十元、但不久終因外匯報硬、賣者雲集、某銀樓二十兩、爲三千五百六十五元、時證券帮突來携進、且某銀樓仍在搜購、致遂再拉提至三千五百九十元、後買方吃胃轉呆、一霎那又降落至三千五百六十五元、此後因外匯突然回軟、人心頓昂、某錢兌業及當日拋空者粉來復進、故遂回起二十八元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業二十兩、爲三千五百九十三元、其後銀樓帮賣意轉濃、漲風頓挫、立回小十餘元、旋聞外匯忽又鬆動、某金號及證券帮等爭先吐出、兼一般浮多前來斬結、加以客帮缺乏進胃、傾瀉數十元、金號塞予銀樓帮十兩、爲三千五百十元、午刻銀樓帮稍有吃胃、略形回高、銀樓帮進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千五百二十元作午收價、結果較上日續跌九十六元、查巳連小四天、共降二百〇五元、半天九十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進的减低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金步小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出，初時大同行仍厯三百六十五元、迨至十一時三十分掛小五元、下午二時五十分又低五元、結果共小十元、計大同行改懸三百五十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小十五元之譜、</p>
<p>英印銀穩中帶疲</p>
<p>三日倫敎電、銀市趨勢平靜、交易果滯、收盤後、仍乏變化、大條讓、近網未更、遠期結〇六二五、紐約銀電、美現貨仍平、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨降一安那、期貨各小二安那、成交單祇十張、</p>
<h3>貼現續低一元</h3>
<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、仍在緩步下低中、每千元初仍三十七元、　即不支、步退至午刻爲三十六元、下午又呆站原價、比前日低一元、錢業公會拆息勿更、仍掛一角半云、一</p>
<h3>糧食　某方統制下　米價難小</h3>
<p>杜粳　昨日杜米新粳及菉罄種百哥等、到貨祇有蘇嘉楓嘉等貨十二三車、然日來在虹口區之各貨、在某方號制下、運出奢爲數不鮮、故咋市本鄉店胃頗有動辦、而吃盤殊緊、各價亦難提升、結果仍處原盤、破　乏貨無市、新元高開二十六元九角、亦屬平庸、全市成交共的八千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　江北尖米、因地價高漲於滬市、難以抵通、及搬運問題仍未能解決、久無抵埠、滬棧存貨不充、一般客囤售心人愈堅、昨晨開即有本鄉作客楨繼問津、客　亦相互授受、致霎時市貨　見告馨、總計成交不下三千餘包、惟行情因受京蕪尖之影響、比前市增高二三角、收盤價高貨爲廿一元六角、中次二十一元三角、至東蕪尖因在某方統制下、業中人殊難把握、鮮進納、惟在早市亦曾跟江北尖一度帶緊、但後卒以東行乘高拋出、又聞到貨積由車輸運抵五千餘包、未能與江北尖同秀、蘆羊尖亦然相仿、</p>
<h3>麫粉絕少生氣　小麥到稀交易擯持</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉仍鮮變化、查本客銷塲、因值週末之期、均無熱烈需要、大都數十包與數百包之零星點綴而巳、購戶方面、意在抑價而取、廠方則以原料價貴、售意仍堅、紅藍車與綠兵船價站七元四角原盤、礮車粉七元五角、全日成交的計二萬餘包麺粉今日有一千包、運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥　昨到貨仍少、各產地來源旣受阻撓、而申地存底亦愈售愈少、故行囤扳持、不願輕晚、但廠胃亦無熱烈之需要、結果市面擯持而乏成交、市塲方面、亦因賣戶擯守不售、致無做開、</p>
<h3>證券　投機集中於外股　瑞镕耶松堅强猛漲　外債漲風已吿平息</h3>
<p>昨日證券暗盤市况、零星空頭稍有抵補、而放空者仍甚熱鬧、祇以環境空氣醞釀、甚囂塵上、大多頭均在隨時見機擺脫、致市價欲漲無力、抬頭不起、趨勢仍係盤旋醞釀之局、前途頗難捉摸也、昨日上午同康生大及大豐等均傾向賣出四號及大通乘機稍有補進、市價賴以不墜、午收乃見稍堅、午後又轉疲勢、散戶多頭漸見脫手、惟鴻大聯和稍有吸收、供求頗爲相稱、趨勢乃毫無軒輊、故結果仍獨好五分至二角半、成交的五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成我大由華火柴公司股三十股、價為十六元五角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所報告云、股市又告活躍、瑞鎔股與耶松股堅强逾恒、前者猛漲達十七元半、後者亦騰踊至一百九十元半、俱在高價下收盤、餘股亦甚堅定、價格參差而高、惟橡皮股之吸引力仍感不足、</p>
<p>又訊、自華商投機集中於外商工商業股票、偽時已久、允以近日外　轉鬆、外股市書、更見非常之活口、有識者以爲公司股票邊分高漲、已由投資成爲投機性質、而已往股票鳳潮之發生、多由於投機過度所致、此次容惑不至有此種廢慮、但爲市面金融安全起見、仍以守常經爲是、</p>
<p>倫敦三日電　今日中國外債掛牌行市、漲風漸戢、僅上檔債券、稍見續升、計英德續借軟（英發）續升二鎊、價爲五十三、克利斯浦續升一鎊、價爲二十七鎊其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫教三日電　今日英商遠東各公司股票行市、續告上升、麥加利銀行股再漲七先令六便士、爲八鎊十二先令六便士、匯豐銀行英倫註册股重升一鎊半、又香港註冊股亦漲半鎊價均爲八十二鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股上升七便士、爲十八先令一便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　本棉沉寂　外棉轉佳　滙票鬆動之後果</h3>
<p>本棉交易愈形沉寂、此由於滙票一再放長、且現最近以來之新高價、同時紗價銷路旣呆滯、而市價不靈、廠方成本有礙、絕少採辦之舉、遂呈擯持之局、至於同業中鑒於以上情况、活動力大爲减削、蘇北來源、到通州花一千四百九十四包、現棉僅同行中進通花一百包、價爲一百三十一元半、鈔票棧交，其他全無行市、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日趨佳境、日來滙兌鬆動、廠方採購原棉、紡紗後每包仍可略得利潤、最近數月來、廠方停止購辦，業已數月、目前廠方存底將枯涸、頗有採購之意、同業亦擬久靜思動、日來各方購意俱屬濃厚、已訂購者共的數千包之譜、今後交易將繼續熱鬧也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初較形靜寂、後因布疋銷數日見增多、現貨交易大爲增加、後因中立法之通過、證券市况堅定、故人心異常興奮、結果棉市收盤價格較之上日漲起十五六磅音不等、印度連同頂測好二羅比餘、埃及平平、利物浦漲十餘便士、</p>
<h3>紗市凋疲不堪　雙地球再跌十元</h3>
<p>紗市依然不離凋疲之境、董以外匯步漲不已、致人心大受打擊、投機家無機可乘、至於實際絕少生氣、華南方固一以法幣提高、港幣回跌，匯水到滬辦貨殊不合算、二則當局對於匯款加厲統制、三以賅處市面又復不振、而存底未罄、紗市處此環境之下、情况表頽不堪、近來浙東方面稍有需要、惜乎吃胃狹隘耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開有浮戶鍳於空氣欠佳、突來斬結二十支雙地球十包、價爲六百〇五元、忽下十元、此時大衆說便宜貨、雙馬外棧貨跌十元、爲六百三十元、少頃投機商視狂落逾甚、復來收進幾包加碼、立刻回升幾元、做到六百三十八元、但外匯大長特長、聞收盤後又見軟弱、查半日間成交統計僅四百二十八包、上日成交二百十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌二元、天女跌一元、雙地球跌十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆去路狹隘</h3>
<p>黄豆自來源激增以來、市氣渙散、行情步挫、比較最高峯時、已削去一元之譜、咋市又跌角許、銷塲雖有出口本街等動辦、但去路狹小、統市計開蚌埠豆二車、價爲十三元三角五角、太倉豆四百包、十四元二角半至十四元四角、南京豆一百九十包、十四元四角至十三元六角半、南翔豆四十包、十三元九角、崇明沙黄二百五十包、十八元五角、浦東杜豆四十五包、十六元三角半、</p>
<p>豆子五日運香港四百六十五包、運厦鬥二百三十包、生油運香港二百五十件、又五百聽、麻油運香港一百五十聽、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細布細斜　現疲期昂</h3>
<p>昨布疋客路實銷沉靜、本街同業進胃亦呆、白貨售盤又見下挫、東貨細布每疋跌落二角至二角半、細斜一角至一角半、十二磅龍頭細布售開現貨卞八元七角半、但行方下月份期貨開價仍昂、聞東棉做出下月龍頭細布每疋價爲十九元四角半、本月喇叭細布十七元七角半、伊籐訂出本月份五福細布價亦十七元七角半、綜計的三百數十件、</p>
<p>又布疋咋有九十五箱、由天津運來、今日有十六件、運往香港、又九十一件運往厦門、</p>
<h3>呢羢定價激漲</h3>
<p>昨日呢絨交易茂盛、大路標準便明暗均呈堅漲、賣方執貨者依然一律居奇、蓋其此後各貨定到困難、洋行定價紛紛激漲、前定四先令之叫萬二千號花呢、目下漲定四先令七辨士、前定四先令五辨士之法蘭絨、目下漲到五先令二辨士、平均鑒於各種歐美呢絨定價、較前統扯激漲一分半至二分、且其一切外費、較之歐戰未起前增加許多、兼付納關稅、無形中又增加百分之四十、故運來外匯須鬆、若欲呢絨之跌價實難、</p>
<h3>海味　胡椒步鬆</h3>
<p>黑椒前市跌至九十三元、後去胃仍淡、而底存充裕、市勢乃步見鬆落、刻市黑大椒與一號椒同售八十八元、比前再小去五元、白椒近日略有成交、高貨爲一百四十八元、中貨一百四十元、亦跌十元之譜、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細布細斜　現疲期昂</h3>
<p>昨外糖因英美荷匯續見放長、趨勢異常軟弱、公會劃盤、二四粗白又跌二元、外棧四十九元半、成交四百包、老貨四十九元、轉口貨三十九元、成交一百包、又路貨本月七日到船五百包、四十元、太古車白B嘜比前日降度竟達四元之譜、以五十三元至五十三元三角、成交三百包、其餘下檔及本綿白等均見隨跌、交易至稀、國糖尚屬平定、潮帮續開高黄崗靑二百包、三十八元、後還價較小、未成、（前日開出上白粉數十包、誤十爲千應更正、）</p>

<h3>南北貨　金菜回升元許</h3>

<h3>煤炭　美貝烟煤　新到一千餘噸</h3>
<p>烟煤塊貨、近因高貨見缺、到源中决居多、不合本街去路、故買意非常濃厚、市價步緊、咋某洋行到有美貝烟煤一千餘噸、託某號售出、計做同業拆價、篩塊每噸八十元、統煤七十六元、碼頭過駁、送到另加行槓一元五角、</p>

<h3>滬西交涉　連日無進展趨勢　偽府幕後有人無法自主　調查戶口迭遭西僑峻拒</h3>
<p>工部局二日所發公報、爲聲明免除誤會起見、曾說明「局方此决提交僞市府關於西區越界築路問題之建議、非在成立一種永久協定、以解決越界築路問題、而僅係商討若干暫時適用之辦法、將停止雙方之磨擦、並確實維持治安秩序、」足證常局委曲求全者、目的在解決目前所發生之一切糾紛、以維護地方安寗、非承認僞組織爲中國之合法政府、與之解決整個越界築路問題、當僞「市長」傅俊庵於接受工部局建議時、曾表示須加慎重考慮、據外交界消息、僞「市府」之一切行動設施、皆出於日方之支持與授意、故在偽方考慮此建議時期內、日方之態度、極可重視、蓋傅必就商於日方也、</p>
<p>日在幕後　操縱指使</p>
<p>關於交涉前途、各方雖皆認爲順利、但亦不容樂觀、在工部局方面、着眼於解決警權問題、不允放棄重大權益、此爲工部局總董樊克令及費利溥兩氏、迭决發表談話所昭告市民者、如不能保持此堅決立塲、忍受日僞方面之威脅、繼續讓步、則決難獲得中外人士之同情與美國之支持、在偽「市府」方面、傅筱庵迭决揚言有「收回越界築路之決心、」但一切均須秉命日方、昨日新申報記載有兩項可注意者、（一）僞「財政局」辦理戶口調查、準備收取各季房捐、（二）偽「警察局」「滬西分著」將遷地豐路、將派造警察三千名常駐滬西、交涉前途、固未許樂觀、最短期內、似難即行解決、</p>
<p>偽府方面　研究內容</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨（三日）悉、工部局於星期四日提交「特別市府」之「建議」、俾暫時解決越界築路爭執者、非至傅「市長」對其中內容研究完畢、則工部局與僞政權雙方代表不致會晤、而討論「建議」內容、費利溥咋答記者問話稱、渠不知何時將召開會議、同時、據與「市長」接近方面表示、是項建議、必須從長考慮、但未披露何時將召開會議、</p>
<p>調配戶口　均遭拒絕</p>

<h3>蟹及甲魚　亦遭統制　日方變本加厲</h3>
<p>日軍邇來對於滬市食料嚴施統制可謂無微不至、前在楊樹浦設立魚市塲後、將各處運滬魚類、悉攔至魚市塲出售、惟蟹及甲魚、尚不在其列、仍可自由運至十六舖碼頭銷售、但近來日方變本加厲、對運滬之蟹及甲魚、亦實施統制、悉被攔至魚市塲强買、如有直接運至十六舖碼頭者、一經發覺、耶遭沒收一般商販、被沒收者爲數甚夥、致損失浩大、咸極憤怒、</p>

<p>交通銀行</p>
<p>衆認駐滬日海軍扣留波利伐輪、或因該輪「屬諸」中政府所轄交通銀行之故、聞波利伐輸前係本埠華人航商以美金八萬元向美某航運公司購買者、橫渡太平洋東來時、該輪係懸</p>
<p>中國旗幟</p>
<p>近中國海岸時、易巴拿馬國旗、該輸抵滬後、委華綸洋行經理、惟因修理費逾六萬元等困難、輸主乃復行出售、由華綸洋行經手、在兩週前售予香港某團體、代價英金二萬一千鎊、時該輪巳懸</p>
<p>挪威國旗</p>
<p>原購者雖已轉售、但虧折頗鉅、聞在美國購買該輪時、係交通銀行付款、交通銀行現　握有該輸之抵押權、查波利伐輪係本週初被日海軍扣留、且有華籍船員被捕、本市美領署對此事、並未發表任何解釋、</p>

<p>緊張氣氛　仍未消釋</p>
<p>北江西路東邊鐵絲網缺口日軍崗位、對進出居民、自突施嚴厲檢查以來、此種緊張氣氛、迄未消釋、據大通社記者咋晚馳往該區內視察、海寗路及文監師路兩缺口處居民進出、除須出示通行證外、並施行嚴查、手據重物者則拒絕其進入鐵絲網以內、有時日崗哨兵、輒離其崗位、蹀　於北江西路街心、愈惹人注目、自北江西路至北河南路、日方兵隊雖巡邏頻繁、然尚無其他限制、故居民尚無不便、</p>

<h3>英輪遭潛艇擊沉　麥唐納夫婦歷險記　雅典尼亞號首中魚雷　麥氏來滬述遇險經過</h3>
<p>大陸報云、歐戰爆發後、英輸雅典尼亞號、首遭潛艇放魚雷轟沉、搭客逃出者數百人、本埠馬勒公司航務監督麥唐納氏夫婦亦在其列、麥氏夫婦咋（三日）乘戰時改髤灰色之亞細亞皇后號輪抵滬、記者在該輪接客船中晤麥氏夫婦、據談遇險經過如下、</p>
<p>突遭震動</p>
<p>九月三日晚、天色晦黯、麥氏夫婦等乘雅典尼亞號輪駛至蘇格蘭西的二百五十哩處、突被爆炸震動、被炸處似在輸中部後引擎室與三等艙附近、麥氏夫婦時在甲板上上下探望、而搭客自房艙奔至輪邊扶手旁者、越聚越多、</p>
<p>爭詢何事</p>
<p>輪中燈光、因首次震動而熄滅、羣相爭問發生何事、空有人曰潛艇、麥氏夫婦均見潛艇在數百碼外、朦朧中依稀可辨、就其狀察之、潛艇似泊該處已久、俄頃、潛艇發一彈、並未命中、而在船之上空爆發、搭客羣出艙門登梯至甲板、時輪上殆無擠擾與呼號、船員辦理緊急工作甚佳、</p>
<p>死六十人</p>
<p>輪上救生艇、均置海面、魚雷命中時、三等艙中喪生者的六十人、餘者均入救生艇逃生、偶有孩童與父母失散者、由其他旅客曳之同行、始破壞井然之秩序、未幾、救生艇均接令駛出、</p>
<p>隨浪浮沉</p>
<p>麥氏夫婦所乘小艇、載五十人、頗為擁擠、朦朧中猶見雅典尼亞號大部份浮海面、移時暮色四合、該輸已不復可睹、而潛艇亦已失共所在矣、救生艇隨浪浮沉、至午夜始有一船之燈光出現、該船乃挪威輪納爾遜號、</p>
<p>一艇覆沒</p>
<p>惟麥氏等所乘之艇、距離過遙、在巨浪中船員不易操縱、後悉納爾遜號推進機在黑暗中擊破求生艇一艘、麥氏等所乘艇中、有波蘭籍旅客一人之妻與三孩、即在該艇、與其他搭客四十人、同遭滅頂、</p>
<p>重慶更生</p>
<p>比至天曙、救護船將各小艇曳至輪旁、麥氏夫婦等由英驅逐艦救起、載至蘇格蘭之格林諾克、等待兩週、始乘美利堅銀行家號輪復渡大西洋、彼等對終雅典尼亞號所得最後印象爲船身傾側甚烈、以待轟擊、使之終沉海底、以免飄浮海面、而發生阻碍、</p>

<h3>「工作的時候工作，遊戲的時候遊戲」</h3>
<p>— 嵺人</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！你伍聽見過這樣的一句諺語嗎？「工作的時候工作，遊戲的時候遊戲」，—這是英國一句很普通的格言，學校裏的師長，家庭中的父母，常常用這句話來訓育他們的學生和兒女，這裏，便讓我把這個問題同各位來談談吧：</p>
<p>我們做任何一件事，總要專心，把全副精神灌注在所做的工作上，這樣才有好的結果和成績，爲什麼呢：且讓我舉個例子來說明，譬如說，今天你們校裏的先生，出了十個算術題，要你們在家演算，那末，小朋友，在你回家之後，第一須把它做起來，在做的時候，並且要引用你的腦力，專心一致的去求解答，切不可把心思移轉到玩皮球上，或逛公園上去，俗語說，「一心不可二用」，就是這個道理呀！因爲在你工作的時候，只有把精神集中在一起，直到工作完成而後已，這樣才會獲得良好的結果。反過來說，假使你在工作的時候，而想到怎樣去哄騙父母，出外和隣家的孩子玩球，或是打算到店舖裏去買糖果。結果，你的算術不但沒有做好，或許竟會把三加五算做七呢！</p>
<p>我們旣然明白了在工作的時候要專心工作，不可參入遊戲的念頭，現在再把「遊戲的時候遊戲」這句話，來解釋一下：</p>
<p>這是和上面同樣的道理！常你放學回家，急匆匆地把書包拋在一隅，便飛也似的跑到同學那邊去打彈子，或捉迷藏。起初，或許因爲剛在校裏淸坐了發個鐘點回來，而感到相當的高興。但是，往往記起了明天要背國語或考常識，自己又沒有充分地預備，而無形中把思想拉到書本上。那時候，雖然一方面在玩着彈子，而另一方面却在擔憂着明天的功課，所以弄得玩也沒趣了。</p>
<p>所以我們一定要在工作完了的時候才遊戲。這樣，不但工作有好的成績，就是遊戲也會感到興趣了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！請記着吧！</p>
<h3>秋天自然談話　蟹和菊</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>秋天的自然界，好像和氣候一般的蕭颯冷靜，幸而有蟹和菊出來，支住這素稱熱鬧的生物局面。現在，我就來談談蟹和菊，作爲我送給本刊小朋友秋天的禮物罷。</p>
<p>蟹在古書上時常稱它呌無腸公子，也許古人吃蟹時揀不出腸胃的緣故，因爲它的身體扁圓，兩旁四足銳利，走路橫行，在水裏，遇着比它更小的動物就把兩螫鉗住不放，兇惡非凡所以人類都賜它一個別凡名橫行將軍。</p>
<p>蟹有雌雄兩種，雄的腹部尖臍，雌的腹部團臍，那些捉蟹的人，到江邊，或河畔產蟹的地方，點着火，說也奇怪，那蟹瞧見了火就會聚集攏來，漁人一鼓兒擒住，滿載而歸，賣給人家。</p>
<p>「持蟹賞菊，」是我國文人在秋天傳爲韻事的，買了幾塊錢蟹，在盛開菊花的園子裹，的幾個朋友，飲酒看菊，談談笑笑，眞是人生樂事啊！</p>
<p>蟹會給人捉住煮來吃，可說它自己也不會相信的，它在水中，那一個不懼怕它，因此它專門欺凌弱小，橫行不法，那知它在水中雖然强橫，可是落到人的手裏，却不免落在鍋子裏，背殼從靑色變紅色，一切都不行了，從這一點看來，可知講霜道不求公理的，結果終要失收。</p>
<p>八九月之間，野外一片荒蕪的草原裏，常有許多挺着細瘦的枝，披着缺痕的綠葉，頂上戴着黄色和尚帽，這就是菊花的老祖宗啊！</p>
<p>菊花因有耐寒的特性，人們非常歡喜它栽培得很多，每一决栽培，因環境的優越，栽培方法的高明，往往產生新種，這樣，新種變新種，種類多得不可勝計因它的姿態和顏色好看，人們賜呼很好聽的名字，像平湖秋月」「綠衣紅裳」「粉西施」等，這許多美麗的名字，都是持鰲賞菊的雅士們所提的。</p>
<p>菊花的葉呈卵形，有缺刻和鋸齒，葉柄不長，互生，葉旁常生腋芽，長大後挿入濕土裏，便成菊花了，春天，我們這樣做，秋天一定能看到鮮艷的花朶，它的花軸縮短得像一隻盤子，盤上生花瓣，呌頭狀花序，它的花冠，周圍的像人的舌頭，只有雌蕊，中央的像圓筒，雌雄蕊都有，不過也有全爲舌，狀或頭狀花冠的。</p>
<p>它的兄弟很多，蒲公英，紅花，除蟲菊等，除掉可以供人欣賞外，還可以醫病，除蟲天對於人類，眞有益處呀。</p>
<h3>小故事</h3>
<p>某處有一個衛生宣傳隊，因爲奬勵大家殺蠅起見，所以貼出許多布告來，並說殺蠅殺得多的人還有獎賞。</p>
<p>有一决，一個老實人帶了幾百串死蒼蠅一去領獎；大家看見他的蒼蠅打得這樣多，都問他那裹來的，老實人說：「這些都是我在坑裏特別養起來的。」（次愷）</p>

<h3>采野菜</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒避難記之四十——</p>
<p>不耐冷的樹木，受到了秋風秋雨的打擊，便有些萎靡的樣兒，更加着西北風嚴厲的刮削，冷霜的刺激，因此把它摧殘了，枯死的枯死，凋謝的凋謝，可是耐寒的常綠樹，雖也感受到寒風嚴霜的淫威，但仍是巍巍的元立着，很鎮靜地不動聲色，更顯得它的葱蘢，現出它的蒼老。地面上的織草黄的黄，死的死，遺體縱橫枕藉，一番肅殺的氣象。可是新生的依舊在嚴酷的氣氛中，從冰裂的泥土中透出它的新生命，不怕霜，不怕風，繁衍它的種族。野芹菜，薺菜，金花菜在這時反是一片靑葱富有一股蓬勃的景色，更可表示它們雖是弱小的生命，而具有堅强不屈的精神。</p>
<p>寒冷的氣候影響到明兒家的「菜蔬問題；」因爲他們已二天來沒有買到翠綠的菜蔬了。這二天中全靠了些猪肉，乾菜，鹹魚和豆干維持着吃飯的菜，只管塞飽肚子，沒有菜蔬更影響到明兒的大便；因爲大便的暢通，全賴新鮮的菜蔬。</p>
<p>「菜蔬問題」發生了的第三天，明兒母親在河邊洗衣，在荒蕪的田裏發現了，薺菜，野芹金花菜！這些耐寒的野生植物的蹤跡，這一團的欣喜，正如哥侖布發見新大陸時一般，於是明兒一家除了父親在家看門外，合家全體便出動了。</p>
<p>母親在前率領着這一個隊伍，踏着曲折蜿蜓的小路走去。每個人的手中都帶着剪刀和籃子，而且都充滿着一腔的野心，想把地面上一切可吃的野菜滿載而歸。走了沒有多少路，便擇了一處野菜富饒的區域，他們一羣人似乎是受了命令般的四散開來，成爲散兵綫的蹲在地上，把尖銳的眼光，找尋那目的物—野芹，薺菜，金花菜，……凡是一切可以吃的，都是十二分的需要。</p>
<p>在這一片滿地是草和野菜混和的田地裹，要能區別出那是草，這是野菜，是件不容易的事，而明兒又是第一回幹這事，當然更多困難了。他只得掘了一棵他以爲是菜的菜，便去問他母親對不對？好一會兒，他只有十多棵的收穫，可是他這樣的蹲上蹲下和跑去問母親來回的路，所付的代價倒超過了他的收穫。他更覺得脚的關節處也有些兒酸痛，便想回去不幹了。這時他哥哥這樣的說：「除了父親外，那一個人不榦便沒有吃菜蔬的權利」。因此明兒只得在這共同贊成的標語之下苦幹着。他母親便敎了他一偭秘訣：「明兒，你要區別那是薺菜或不是？這很容易，常你以爲它是薺菜，便把它剪卜，在它根處用你鼻子去嗅嗅是不是有薺菜的氣味」？接着他母親便做個樣兒給他瞧，一些兒也不錯。他母親更說道：「明兒，你要是把薺菜采得多一些的話，今天我們可以吃薺菜肉絲豆腐羹，眞好吃」。這是他母親鼓勵他的話。</p>
<p>明兒便依這秘訣，更是眼鼻並用，手快腳快，沒有一刻，他的收穫收是很豐富，一方面更想到那豆腐羹的美味，更快的采着，采着在太陽將西沉的時光，便停止了工作。野芹，薺菜，金花菜，馬萊頭……這是他伍勞力換來的收穫，旣節省了金錢，而「菜蔬問題」也迎刃而解。那晚的豆腐羹，眞是分外的可口。</p>
<h3>藍矮子　（上）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>伊伊看中了一個很舒服的角隅坐了下來，伊的背恰好靠在一棵大樹的根上，這樹根恰又是空的，倒像一隻安樂椅一樣。伊靠在這樹根上很爲舒服，本來想拿出書來看一會，可是這當兒陽光已在隱去，又因林子裏樹蔭很濃，光綫更弱，看書是不相宜的。况且伊這時的思想，非常複雜，實在也沒有看書的心緒了。</p>
<p>阿麗靜坐在那裹，不時的聽得奇怪而細微的聲響，有一二次竟好似有小小的脚聲，在一路走來，又好似遠處有尖銳的笑聲，隱隱地在風中吹送過來；阿麗每聽得一種聲響，伊的心也跳得快了一些；伊並不害怕，只覺得興奮得很。</p>
<p>伊又暗暗的想道。：「我要是在這裏靜靜的坐着等着，停一會正不知要發見什麼新奇的東西哩。當然，我希望那些矮人是一種又美觀而又很小巧的人必須比剛才所瞧見在街上走過的那個矮老頭兒小一些，而和磁器廠裏的那些藍矮子同樣的玲瓏可愛。但我以爲他們一定像仙人一樣，是不大不小，比那矮老頭兒一定小，而比了藍矮子一定要大得多。」</p>
<p>阿麗想到了矮人的大小問題，又想到了這森林裹究竟有沒有一個矮人國，於是伊的心亂了。伊想來想去，總是委決不下，只是喃喃自語道；「據我想來，那些矮人決不會怎樣大的，也許和我的大姆指差不多大小吧。咦，這是怎麼一回事？」原來伊正在這裏想，猛覺得有什麼東西，在伊的鼻子上碰了一下。伊抬起頭來，心中很有些着惱，想誰敢這樣大胆，來碰我的鼻子呢？也許是阿立探知我在這裹，所以悄悄地溜到我背後來，和我鬧着玩嗎？不道伊想到這裹，又覺得鼻子上被碰了一下，低頭一看，原來是一顆松子，從上面松樹上掉下來，恰好打中伊的鼻子。</p>

<h3>「譯意風」試聽記</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>喧傳一時的「譯意風」，咋天早上在大光明大戲院作初度試騐。那是一付礦石機的聽筒，（研究過無綫電的讀者，大概都知道那種套在頭上，祇能一個人收聽的聽筒吧？）將通着兩個耳機的綫頭，挿在座位背後裝製的「撲落」中，就如無綫電似的卽刻收到淸晰的國語對白和說明。現在大光明的座位背後，已裝製「譯意風」設備的，有二百座，並定於本月九號（下星期四）開始供應。觀衆購票的時候，如另付代價一角，就能享受這種權利</p>
<p>担仟說明的是聶，劉，包，三位小姐，她們都是大學畢業生，據說也都是影迷，所以她們很高興担任這項繁重的工作。因爲把英語對白譯成國語，通過「譯意風」而送到觀衆的耳朶里，並不能像平常的翻譯那樣，等到每句對白說完之後，電影上的對白是很緊湊的，她們的翻譯也要和劇中人同時啟口，才能不致顧此失彼。所以在每部電影正式開映之前，她們先要看過一决試片，然後再熟讀英語的分幕對白本，這樣，正式開映的時候，她們能够完全知道這部電影的劇情和對白而從容地翻譯出來。</p>
<p>昨天試映的是華納裴士德的「風流奇俠」，担任「譯意風」翻譯的那位小姐，不但把對白每句都詳盡地譯出來，並且翻譯的語氣，也是和劇中人的情緒相脗合。在「淡出」「淡入」之間，更加入簡單的劇情叙述，或人物的介紹，對於完全不懂英語對白的觀衆，確是有意想不到之效力。不過它也如銀幕上加印華文字幕的擾亂「視野」一樣，對於懂得英語對白，無論完全或是幾分之幾的，「譯意風」也是會打擾我們的「聽野」的。—在我個人至少有這樣的感覺，這或許就是所謂「心無二用」的道理。</p>

<h3>吳素秋今後之動態</h3>
<p>— 延綠軒主</p>
<p>吳素秋三個字在過去，上海並沒有人知道她，雖然她在平津平劇界中，可以執後起中的牛耳，但是在這二年多的歲月裏，平津方面的音信，上海的朋友們，也不敢信以爲眞。現在吳素秋來了一個多月，演了二十餘塲戲，在她出演期中，並沒有很好的服裝，大人先生們贈送的緞額，來做她的號召，完全靠着她的鐵的嗓子，流利的行腔；生動的演技；精細的排練；奠定了她在上海藝術的地位。所以在她才上的時候，上座並沒有怎樣的了不得，可是觀衆一天多似一天，結果到了最後一天，三千多觀衆，得不到鑒賞的機會，所以，觀衆方面，不斷的向更新要求，希望吳素秋再來露一决臉，做他們藝術的食糧。她因爲合的期滿的關係，不得不下，更新方面，當然接受觀衆的意見。經雙方數度接洽，重演更新，到目今巳成爲了事實</p>
<p>爲着要得到吳素秋今後的動態，特意的到中央旅社作了一次的訪問，正在運用她的生花妙筆醮着黄色繪出一柄菊花扇面，生動而有勁，便中訊及今後演出的戲目，據說此决演出仍以新戲爲主題，偶有一二段反串戲，作一種處女的嘗試，比較重要者爲「芙蓉劍」「張玉貞」「全部潘巧雲」「女打棍出箱」「人面桃花」「巴駱和」「白夫人」等均在準備中，小放牛一劇，向不輕易演出，也許在可能範圍內露演。希望能以更新頴的恣態，努力的演技，精湛的劇本，精密的排演，來答應大量觀業們的需求。</p>

<p>王芸芳父子重逢之奇事</p>
<p>是日黄余榮氏亦在座，遂由徐朗西氏介紹搭入老共舞臺，旋又相續轉入大新、天蟾、等舞臺，惟自抵滬演唱伊始，即復王姓，並改名芸芳，兩月前，我的叔父會自距滬甚近之某鎮來滬觀劇，彼在天蟾見余之名及面貌，大爲驚異，返告我父，謂相貌如何與父相似，且芸字亦係余輩之排行字也。復閱雜誌及戲報，知余已往在山東時諸事頗詳，因遂試投一函至天蟾後臺，初接此信時，猶疑滬上乃萬惡之藪，此種事層見疊出，故竟置之不答。後余叔又偕父同來觀劇，父見余之年貌神情，酷肖余七齡時之情狀，即計算年齡，亦正相若，因復作書致余，備述曩年棄家出走諸事甚詳。自是余始稍信，並先索照片一閱，而後乃接至滬寓同居。多日以來，見其舉止端莊，平居寡言，除理佛外別無他嗜，始悉其神經上確曾受有重大刺激。再者彼若腦筋無病，亦決不至棄余母子於不顧，並二十年不通音問也。最後芸芳復謂人生離合固不奇，所奇者乃余復改姓名後，由少卿先生隨便取一芸字，而此字竟與余之行輩字相同，因此遂得余叔之注意，而得父子重逢，豈果余好佛之報歟？（一三四）</p>

<p>被任為外相由於他是美國的友人　看他有否這手段達到對他的企望</p>
<p>門面性的外相</p>
<p>在日本，以一個海陸軍中人而出任內閣要員，這已是一個司空見慣的事。過去有齋籐岡田等的出任首相，宇垣的出任外相。阿部內閣成立，以海軍大將出身的野村吉三郎也以美國友人的資格出現而爲霞關的主人，他是吾能施展他的抱負，而達到日本人民所對他的企望呢？當然一個國家對另一個國家的根本外交政策，絕不會因爲別一國家人事更動而就會有轉移，况且野村的登台，在他國內的支配外交的軍人看來，本就是所謂「門面性」，拿來點綴點綴，擺擺樣子，並不對於他抱著什麼大的奢望。他國內的實力派對他已經表示了這樣的態度，那末他在外交折衝上，允其對美國關係上所能達到的成就，也就可推想而知了。</p>
<p>一二八事變時來滬作戰</p>
<p>提起野村大將，當然是我們所熟知的人物。一二八事變後，與鹽澤率領日本海軍和十九路軍對敵的，就是野村，他那時還是中將銜。到了四月一十九日，日本軍民在虹口慶祝天長節時，被韓人投彈受傷，瞎去了一隻眼睛。回國後，曾由天皇賜假眼一隻。他是美國安那波利斯（Aun-apllis）軍校出身，一度爲駐美國首都華盛頓的海軍武官，那時現在美國總統羅斯福，恰爲美國海軍决長，因此和羅斯福認識。所謂美國的最好友人，就是因爲有這樣的原橡。</p>
<p>車訂新商約的困難</p>
<p>他和普通日本人相反，身材極爲魁梧，差不多有六英尺高，二百磅重。他的性情，相當溫和，在集會時，總是沉默不大開口，有時在瞌睡，或作微笑。這樣好好先生，在這日本四面楚歌的時候，身任外交之重，要他打開目前僵局，恐不是他國人所想象那般容易！原來日美關係的惡劣，不是一朝一夕所致，而其中的問題，也包括很多。最主要的，自然是美國在華權益問題，這又牽涉到美國對遠東的基本政策，如九國公的中門戶開放，及機會均等，開放珠江及長江等問題，而這些問題，一方面固然是日本幾年來軍事行動所造成的結果，他方面日本所推行的亞洲門羅主義，以及近來的所謂遠東新秩序，根本是與美國的對華政策相違反的。所以野村要與美國交涉圓滿，成立新通海航海條的，那無異緣木求魚。我們且聽他最近的自供吧。他於最近會向內閣承認「改善日美關係，希望很微」這照他說是由於美國堅絕反日的態度。所以他深恐明年一月日美商的期滿後，兩國關係的更趨於嚴重化。然關於怎樣消除這樣嚴重形勢的方策，則未提及。同時那位外務省發言人須磨，則又吾認外傳開放揚子江及珠江的消息，說日政府當局及包括外務省在內，目下對於此類事件並未考慮及之，這就是講日本對於美日糾紛所在的問題，沒有加以考慮，那末美日根本就無接近的可能，調整邦交，談何容易！</p>
<p>建設新中央政權的把戲</p>
<p>野村旣無法打開日美間的僵局，那末他今後的外交政策，根本仍追隨了軍部，援助所謂「中國新中央政權」，用所謂「堅毅之決心」，進行所謂「建設東亞的鉅大責任」，而同時使美國「能正確了解這種目的及日本所具的決心」，這無異向美國示威，表示日本仍是「我行我素」，美國除開承認遠東新秩序外，其他一切沒有討價還價的餘地，這樣方策，雖然出於美國之友自居的野村，恐怕不是美國所敢領情的吧！</p>
<h3>戰地一角　粵北的重鎭　韶關</h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>在日機的慘炸下商業區盡成灰燼</p>
<p>韶關，一名曲江，位於禎武二水的交會處，爲粵贛，粵湘出入的孔道，自古就爲兵家必爭之地。總理率師北伐，大元帥行署，就設於韶關，在此籌劃軍事，奠定了革命軍北伐的基礎，民國十五年，蔣委員長亦於韶關誓師北伐，所以它在國民革命的過程中，是值得我們紀念的。廣州失陷後戰局重心，移至粵北，韶關在軍事上的地位，便一天天的重要起來，它不但總縮着粵北的戰局，同時還居中策應着東江和西江的戰事，隨着南戰塲整個局勢的開展，日漸壯大了。</p>
<p>活躍的交通</p>
<p>韶關的交通，非常便利，陸路方面，有粵漢鐵路北通長沙，南達廣州。公路則粵北蛛網般的公路綫，都以韶關爲銜接點。水路方面，有北江上達湘贛，下通廣州，帆船和輸船，往來如織。這些交通錢，自軍興以來，即爲軍需品及軍隊運輸的大動脈。</p>
<p>壯麗的市容</p>
<p>最近幾年中，爲着種種主要條件的存在，使它很快的染上近代都市的形式。實廣平坦的柏汕路，水泥鋼骨的建築物，都不斷的出現在韶關市上，把它裝扮得儼然是個現代化的都市了。中山，民權，民生等路，都是很富麗堂皇的。金融方面，因有中國，農民，廣東等銀行的設立，也不似從前的滯阻了。文化方面，除原有的北江日報外，尚有衝陽遷來的大剛報和正中報，銷數都不錯。街上的壁報，到處都有。定期刊物，也有好幾種。商業方面，因這裹是北江各地貨物的集散地，雖沒有十分大規模的店鋪，但在北江各城市中，韶關却首屈一指了。</p>
<p>慘酷的轟炸</p>
<p>經過日機無數决的殘酷轟炸後，繁榮的商業區，已成爲沒有一問完整房屋的廢墟了。舉目一望，滿城都是炸彈坑。但儘管日機不斷的轟炸，人民情緒的熱烈和嚴肅，却是使人佩服的。每當空襲警報凄厲地響着，人民就從容地躱避到郊外去，到日機飛臨韶關上空的時候，城中巳閱無一人，常常落了很多炸彈，倒塌了很多房屋，却並無一人死傷在無情的彈片下。我方的軍政要員，都駐蹕終此，策劃着粵省的戰事，不讓日軍完成打通粵漢路的好夢。</p>
<p>馳譽的勝蹟</p>
<p>韶關的勝蹟，首推東城的曲石岡，三十六石，以决排列而東，奇瑰秀逸，每當雨過天晴，遠遠望去，好似有縷縷的雲絲，在嬝嬝上昇，名爲「韶石生雲」，列於曲江二十四景的第一。相傳古時聖君虞舜，曾登此石奏韶樂，韶州及曲江的名稱，都取義於此。在城南十里，有一個南華寺，係梁代天監年天竺國僧徒智藥所建立，唐時六祖慧能，曾住此說法，至今六祖的衣鉢和眞身，尚在寺內。</p>
<p>韶關的救運工作，自張向華將軍蒞此視事以來，黨政軍各團體已團結得多，大家都切實合作，在民間展開了深入的救亡工作。軍事要員陳誠，白崇禧，葉劍英等，也先後到韶巡視，更給予民衆以在熱的鼓勵。所以今日的韶關，雖滿目彈痕，但新生的嫩芽，是由焦土上抽出來的。在最近的將來，它必然可能成爲克復廣州，收復所有的失地，以至爭得民族獨立解放的根據地！</p>
<h3>名人小傳　艾登</h3>
<p>最近據潑立斯來在「英國，醒醒吧！」一文中，說：「英國政府人員的遴選，惟相當背景的人物是求」。所以英國的官吏，多半是出身貴族。前外相阿托尼，艾登也爲其中之一；但艾氏雖過慣貴族生活，並不同其他貴族一樣，一味息事寗人畏首目畏尾的。他曾因捷克事件，對希特勒的侵略及張伯倫的綏靖政業，大爲不滿，且因此而去職。</p>
<p>艾登生於一八九七年，母親爲倫敦社會中的交際花，父親是男爵。艾氏生得很秀麗，喜修飾，服裝是極時髦的。他的哥哥弟弟都在上次大戰中犧牲，他自己在伊勃而一役中，被毒瓦斯襲擊，幾乎傷命，所以也可以說死裏逃生的。</p>
<p>當他辭去外相以後，不像我國古代的大官兒，退隱林泉，度其「松風吹解帶，山月照彈琴」的優閒生活，他仍冀爲國服務，向陸軍部志願軍投効，陸軍部因爲前决大戰他在來福槍聯隊中服務，駕輕就熟，所以仍將他編入皇家來福槍第二聯隊中。際此時會，他拿着望遠鏡細察遠矚，可說英雄有用武之地了。</p>

<h3>海上封鎖時之進出口</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>歐戰時進出口商注意事項</p>
<p>戰時違禁品</p>
<p>在原則上，中立國與交戰國仍有其通商自由的；但事實上不能不受交戰國的約束和限制。把「戰時違禁品」售給交戰之甲方，被乙方拿捕卽予沒收；反之，即被甲方沒收。這是誰都知道的了。何種是違禁品？歐戰雙方都巳公佈而且可向各該國使領館索閱品目單。這裏無暇列舉，但大體上分絕對禁止與有條件禁止兩類。前者包括軍器，彈藥，戰具，燃料，原料，貨幣財物，軍用圖籍等等。後者包括食料，飼料，服用品及其原料等等。然當決定其爲貨物之品性與是吾供給敵方時，那就有複雜的規定。依國際法的規定是：</p>
<p>公法上的規定</p>
<p>（甲）由中立國輸出者，如屬於絕對禁止品；在下列塲合，即行無條件沒收：（一）船舶簿據上載明運往敵港或供給敵軍者。（二）直達敵港而不停泊他港之船舶所載的貨物；（三）雖往中立港之船舶，但需先經敵港或有遭遇敵軍可能之船舶所載者。</p>
<p>（乙）由中立國輸出之有條件的禁止品，在下列塲合，得確定爲供給敵方；惟得提出反證。沒收與吾？則由輸船檢查處或捕獲品法庭裁決。（一）供給敵國官廳者；（二）供給敵商而轉交敵國政府者；（三）運往敵軍根據地或其後方兵站等地者；（四）運給敵國政府代理人或敵國政府監督下之商業機關者。</p>
<p>（丙）此項禁止品及承運之船舶的處分，以船舶國籍而決定之：</p>
<p>違禁品的沒收</p>
<p>由中立國船舶輸送者：（一）輸送違禁品之船舶，一律逮捕，可不問其國籍。（二）捕獲之遠禁品，全部沒收；（三）捕獲之遠禁品的價值，重量，容積，或其應付運費，等於該船積載總值，總量，總容積，總運費收入之任何一項的半數以上，得沒收其船舶。（四）同船內之非違禁品如同屬違禁品之所有者，亦予沒收；此外得放行，但可暫予扣留，以便審查。（五）依倫敦宣言對於禁止品問題之規定，凡輸送禁止品之船舶，如在戰爭發生前或公佈違禁品宜言之前而航行海中，又不及將貨物上陸者；沒收時應經以賠償。</p>
<p>由敵方船舶輸送者；（一）沒收其船舶；（二）沒收其所載之全部貨物；（三）其中之非違禁品，屬中立國所有者，原則上發還，但須提出有力之證據。</p>
<p>中立國商民以履行戰爭發生後之契的，而將貨物輸送敵方商民，不論其是吾特的，概作敵貨論。故凡由敵方船舶所載之貨物，即屬中立國之貨物，仍不免被沒收。</p>
<p>（丁）由交戰國方面輸入時，原則上雖有自由；但以提出證據，確實證明其爲敵國商民售與中立國商民者爲限。吾則，或以敵國船舶輸送的塲合，還有被沒收的危險。依上决歐戰中英國捕獲品法庭的判例而論，如其貨款於起運前業已全部付淸者，始得援引上項的權利，而承認其所有權爲屬於中立國方面。否則仍作敵貨論。此處法國扣留路經海防的德方產品，因其所有權早屬華商所有，所以現已取得法方的諒解，准予放行；即此之故。</p>
<p>預備出口證書</p>
<p>中國可能輸出的只有原料，食料之類；沿途遭逢檢查的大都是英國海軍。如果輪給德國·顯然絕對危險。即便輸給其他國家，也非充分戒備不可！依駐滬央領館發出的公告，凡載貨赴歐洲的船隻，不論其國籍，都應準備貨物證明書一份，確切註明承辦貨物的姓名，不可祇寫「定貨」兩字；以便沿途接受檢查。</p>

<p>社會調查</p>
<h3>仁濟育嬰堂</h3>
<p>— 徐傑英</p>
<p>筆者在前日下午特地到仁濟育嬰堂作一决訪問，承製育嬰堂主持人胡馥卿先生予以接見，並且誠懇地領導參觀，詳細講解，使筆者明白許多內中情形</p>
<p>室內的設備</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂雖然是舊式弄堂房子，屋字倒也寬暢，陽光充足，空氣流通。嬰兒的臥房共有三大間，屋內的佈置也還整潔，三間共有嬰兒百人左右，每個嬰兒都穿了輕柔和暖的棉襖，蓋上潔凈的棉被，睡在一張新式的小鐵床上。</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂原是仁濟善堂中的一部分，</p>
<p>設立的經過</p>
<p>因爲要多做些福嬰的工作，所以才在五六十年之前另行組織育嬰堂。起初堂址就在仁濟善堂的隔壁，範圍很小，後來因爲棄兒日多，不能不加以擴充，所以才遷到跑馬廳路，算起來已經是廿多年前的事了。</p>
<p>男女的比例</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂每年收養的嬰兒很多，為數總在八九百個左右，因爲現在社會上還不免有重男輕女的思想，所以在棄兒之中，女嬰遠多於男嬰，在每年收養的八九百嬰孩之中，男嬰的數目從不超過一百！</p>
<p>置放的手續</p>
<p>有些育嬰堂在門口外面放一隻能够轉動的抽屜，棄兒的父母把他們的孩子放入抽屜，撳一下鈴，裹面的人聽到鈴聲就會轉動抽屜把嬰兒接進去。可是仁濟育嬰堂的情形就不同，棄兒的父母應該把他們孩子的時辰八字寫好，送進門房，交賬房登記留養。至於嬰兒被棄的原因，他們並不詳細調查的。</p>
<p>乳嬰的奶媽</p>
<p>每人只要餵兩個嬰兒吃奶，所以孩子們的營養都還充足，可是送到育嬰堂來的嬰兒多半是身體不健康的，所以他們又請了中醫和西醫每天來給嬰兒診病，此外還有十位護士輪流看護嬰兒。其中有一個一歲多的孩子，據說在兩個月以前送來的時候是身體很孱弱的，可是現在已經養得又白又紅，很活潑地在學走了。除了護士以外，還有三位女管理員負責督促奶媽工作。像這樣的組織和這樣的工作方針，眞可以稱得上完善了。</p>
<p>嬰孩的領出</p>
<p>送進來的嬰兒雖然多，被領出去的也不少，只要找到可靠的舖保，略貼乳資，就可以挑自已所愛的嬰兒領出去，所以比較優良的嬰兒都被領出去了。留在堂裏的多半是初生的嬰兒，最大的還只在呀呀學語呢，至終嬰兒長大以後的敎育及出路，倒是一件值得考慮的事了。</p>
<p>今後的發展</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂的經濟可以說完全由仁濟善堂担負，因爲福嬰工作至今還不十分受社會注意，所以並沒有外界的捐款。單靠仁濟善堂的資助來救濟這些苦命的棄兒本來已經是一件不容易的事，所以要想充分地發展更是十分困難。八一三職後，民生日困，被棄的嬰兒也日漸增加，所以福嬰工作和救濟難民是具有同樣的重要性，而怎樣使福嬰工作充分進展史是目前一個不容忽視的問題。</p>
<h3>希特勒的英籍愛人</h3>
<p>— 尤宜德·密特福</p>
<p>英國閨秀允宜德·密特福（Unity　Mitford）是李德斯寶勒助爵（Lord　Redesdale）的女兒。她是一個希特勒的在熱崇拜者。她過去與希特勒來往很密，成爲希特勒的知友。有一個時期，外面謠傳，說她也入德國籍，變爲德國的公民。可是她對於這謠傳，却極力吾認，說沒有這一會事</p>
<p>她與希特勒親密關係，可由她的參加國社黨各種重要典禮，加以證明。去年德國吞併奧國後，希特勒到奧國首都維也納時，允宜特女士也跟着希特勒到了那地方。今年英德開戰前幾星期，她又到慕尼黑去作假期旅行。大戰發生後，她並沒有像別的英僑一樣退出德國，而有久住德國的樣子。據最近哈瓦斯傳來消息，說她在慕尼黑去見希特勒時，因希特勒痛罵英國，與希特勒發生爭執，因此受了極大刺激，回到旅館，竟萌短見，當晚服安眠藥自殺。到了第二天早晨，才被人發覺，巳經昏迷不醒，後由人送往療養院醫治，始幸獲救云。</p>
<h3>千里眼的實現　略談電視</h3>
<p>我國的舊小說中有順風耳千里眼這類的幻想，說相隔千百里的聲音及景物，能够聽得，能够看見；但許多人承認這不過小說家瞎說罷了。自從無錢電發明後，同此類似的奇事，一一有了實現，譬如無綫電話極像順風耳，雖發音台遠隔雲山，其美妙的音樂，抑揚的演說，經收音機收得後如同晤言一室，這是婦孺皆知，不用贅說了。至於類乎千里眼者是什麼？是電視。電視是將人物的動作等，映入發射機，使機中的電流起變化，或强或弱成爲雷波而傳於遠處，如有接收機，將此類電波收得，還原爲形像，於是「有目共覩」，這不是千里眼麽？</p>
<p>何時會到上海</p>
<p>無綫電話收音機現巳街首巷尾所在多有了。電視發射台何時會到上海？這個問題，倒頗不易回答；但我們可以推度一下。原來第一座無綫電廣播台設立在美國，其時爲一九二〇年，隔了五年（一九二五年）上海有一家美商開洛公司就建設了一座電力二百五十瓦特的播音台於南京路，在設立此台以前，已有ECO播音台的設立，但係試騐性質，茲姑不論。如以開洛爲準，則中外創設無綫電廣播台，相隔不過五年。現在電視在美國金門博覽會已公開表演，到本年五月止，美國已登記的電視發射台有二十三座，其中三座是移動的，其他都是固定的。電力最大者爲Wzxep，波長以六公尺半至四公尺爲最普遍。所以一九三九年爲電視在美國眞正實現的年頭，如果以此例彼，則再過五年，（一九四四年）上海當有電視發射台的成立。雖然或因人事及其他的關係，會有遲早一點，但這根據情理的猜測，可以說「雖不中不遠矣」。</p>
<p>電視工作大要</p>
<p>在一九三〇年，發射機及接收機都用旋轉式的舊法的，這是利用機械的動作，後來經沙來肯（Zworykin）博士等埋頭研究的結果，採用一種新法，呌做「陰極光綫制」。原來眼睛所以能看見人物，是由人物能反射强弱不同光錢終眼睛甲，傳之於腦，遂起「視」的作用。現在將這些强弱不同的光錢，反射入呌做光電管的器械上，由牠的作用，耶產生了强弱不動的電波，向四方發射。至於接收機上有一根長形玻璃管，其一端是扁平的，收得的電波經機件後，影即現於其扁平面上。信種玻管，普通呌作陰極綫管，有的一端是一面鏡子。此管的位置在機件上部，下面是裝發音的喇叭。</p>
<p>所現的影，最好的有七十平方英寸的面積。影的淸晰與吾，用球形的機紐管理。起碼的是十二平方英寸的面積，只適合家庭中使用。至於收發機的零件及搆造法等等，巳知無綫電話裝製及原理的人也能舉一反三，並不難懂，不過一般讀者或許無興趣來研究牠，並且短短的本文中也不能詳述。</p>
<p>接收機的價值</p>
<p>談到接收機的價值眞是駭人聽聞，原因是爲電視尚在萌芽時代，機件出品不多，成本就貴，售價也不得不貴。另外是物以稀爲貴，製造廠家也不免敲點竹槓。現在好點的接收機需美金三百元到五百元，起碼的一百五十元到二百元，目下的滙價中若合成我國法幣，就是最低的價錢也耍二千一百餘元，最高的須七千餘元，這是照滙豐掛牌合算的。不過我們記得一二八事件草草結束後，半年以內，上海的廣播電台如雨後春筍地建設起來，則將來抗戰圓滿成功，電視發射台必當風起雲湧罷。</p>

<h3>科學斷片</h3>
<p>英國現有一種試騐，頂備將街路邊緣的石片或水門汀，改用玻璃，以求夜間交通的安全。</p>
<p>德國爲了節省皮革，新發明一種塗料，用以髹漆鞋底，這是用砂和其他粒狀物混合而成的，聽說用此種塗料以後，鞋子便非常堅牢。</p>
<p>爲了節省鋼鐵等金屬，日本某公司正在計劃想用賽珞璐以作自來水管。</p>
<h3>鬧鐘</h3>

<p>普通人應用鬧鐘，只在晨起之時。但事實上鬧鐘的用途很廣，凡需要確守時間，防除遺忘的事情，都可利用。例如</p>

<p>等在家庭中用途眞異常廣</p>
<p>泛而有益。</p>
<h3>戰時小新聞</h3>
<p>德國當局爲使士兵相信德國有充分糧食準備，在柏林放演一片名爲德國軍隊之主要食糧。然該片所放演者，僅爲貯藏猪肉之一小部。他方面，英國亦放演一片，將倫敦熱鬧中心及堆積如山的各種貨物及運載之卡車等，皆表演出來，使德國相形見絀。</p>
<p>專供希特勒僩人食用的咖啡兩噸，業已在紅海上的阿頓口岸上被扣云。</p>
<p>據英國每日電聞載：蘇聯政論家拉迪克，自一九三七年，因與德國國社黨暗通聲氣，被判監禁十年後，早巳被釋無罪，今年三月起，在墨斯科開始組織波蘭共產黨人，爲「赤化」波蘭的準備。又據巴黎某報載；拉氏生長於波蘭，現已受蘇聯政府的委任，爲「赤化」蘇聯所佔領的波蘭部分之主要人物云。</p>
<p>巴黎歌劇，仍將繼續在巴黎或南池兩地演出。法蘭西戲劇院，自戰爭開始後雖一度宣告停業，現又開演，並新建一堅固的避彈窒，一旦有飛機投彈，觀衆即可奔入避難。</p>
<p>巴黎景象，雖比戰前稍形凄凉，不過夜間並不如倫敦那樣如黑地獄一般。因爲英國燈火管制甚嚴，一至夜間，即黯然無光，法國夜間的街燈，除有警報時外，仍照常放光，惟不十分光亮吧了。又警報時街燈有一總機關，總機關一撥，全市街燈皆熄滅云。</p>

<h3>Fifty-Four Japanese Planes Attack Chengdu; Fierce Air Battle Ensues; Several Japanese Planes Shot Down; Two Sets of Remains Recovered; Chinese Troops Briefly Capture Xinkaitang in Northern Hunan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chengdu, 4th. This morning, fifty-four Japanese planes, divided into two groups, invaded Sichuan from the northeast. Around 11:00 AM, they successively invaded the vicinity of Chengdu. The brave Chinese pursuit force, with a grand array, awaited in full readiness. They encountered the Japanese planes over the northern suburbs of Chengdu and immediately launched a fierce attack, encircling and firing from all directions. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented this year. Numerous Japanese planes were seen hit, smoking, and their formations scattered as they fled south. It has been confirmed that one Japanese twin-engine heavy bomber crashed in the Ren-shou and Le-zhi county areas, respectively. Several other heavily damaged Japanese planes are also being investigated for crash sites. All Chinese planes landed safely without any losses. It is reported that Japanese planes blindly dropped many bombs, but they all fell in the wilderness, causing no Chinese losses. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to Chinese sources today, the Japanese planes that attacked the Chengdu airfield this morning numbered fifty-three. The Chinese shot down four. The only Chinese plane destroyed by Japanese bombing was an American-made plane. At 11:07 AM, fifteen to twenty Chinese fighter planes intercepted the Japanese planes in the air. The sound of machine guns could be clearly heard. As the Japanese planes flew over the south gate of Chengdu and across West China University, Chinese anti-aircraft guns also fired at them. Although many holes were blasted into the Chengdu airfield, ranging from seven feet to twenty feet in circumference, the damage to the airfield was not significant and easily repairable. According to Chinese eyewitnesses, the first air raid alarm was issued at 9:45 AM. The air battle between Chinese and Japanese planes over the northern part of Chengdu was extremely fierce. It is reported that many Japanese planes were shot down. One crashed in Ren-shou county, south of Chengdu, and another crashed in Le-zhi county, southeast of Chengdu. The search for others that were shot down is currently underway. (4th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. At 11:00 AM this morning, fifty Japanese bombers attacked Chengdu. Chinese fighter planes ascended to intercept them and shot down two Japanese planes. (4th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to sources here today, Chinese guerrilla forces in southern Hubei ambushed forty Japanese military trucks yesterday in the Dongshan-Yuelu area of Yanglousi, northwest of Yuezhou. Ten of the trucks plunged off the rocks into the valley. It is estimated that Japanese casualties, including those killed by the Chinese, totaled at least 300. (4th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo. Chinese troops in northern Hunan briefly captured the Japanese stronghold of Xinkaitang, southeast of Yueyang, last night, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese sent large reinforcements and counterattacked eastward, after which the Chinese safely withdrew. (4th dispatch)</p>

According to Chinese sources in Shanghai and Hong Kong, Wang reportedly flew to Tokyo on November 2nd to continue discussions with leaders of the Japanese government and military. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to reliable sources here today, after the establishment of Wang Jingwei's so-called "central government," Japan will present peace conditions to the China represented by the "Wang government" based on Konoe's declaration of last December. These conditions originally intended to provide open assistance to China in abolishing the consular jurisdiction of third countries in China and canceling the concessions of third countries in China, but although this article has not been abolished, it has not been mentioned. As for the Japanese so-called peace conditions, there are several types: (1) Establish a Sino-Japanese "Manchurian" anti-communist group; (2) Sino-Japanese economic cooperation; (3) China recognizes Japan's special zone in North China, Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and the Nanjing triangle, and Japan enjoys special rights in these areas; (4) Japan stations troops in China, but South China is not included in the Japanese garrison area, nor is it劃 into Japan's special zone. In addition, Konoe's declaration, which also included assisting China in abolishing consular jurisdiction and concessions, is no longer included in Japan's policy toward China, and its purpose is to seek a coordination with the interests of third countries. It is also heard that in order to ease the opposition of third countries, Japan also intends to open up the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, so that third countries can restore their lost trade. It is said that these peace conditions are only for the "Wang government," while the government led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be regarded as a "local rebellion."

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Discusses the Political Situation in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>A certain place. Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong recently arrived here. A reporter visited him and inquired about the political situation in Zhejiang Province. Huang said that the Japanese invaders in China are deeply mired in the quagmire and are now trying their best to maintain their position and seek to use war to support the war, without any offensive power. Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, the Japanese have not been very active recently. Zhejiang Province is now focusing on construction, such as opening Yingshi University, adding temporary middle schools, and establishing machinery factories, so that all kinds of machines can be self-made and self-sufficient. Tea-making machines and oil presses have been popularized throughout the province, with remarkable results. As for the financial aspect, it has not been affected by the interruption of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway or the occasional blockade of seaports. Although many places in Zhejiang Province are disturbed by the Japanese, the people do not evade the taxes they should pay. As for the financial personnel, they have all been replaced by promising young people, and they have already achieved the goal of ensuring that every penny goes to the public. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Invites US Ambassador Grew for Talks; Grew Issues Frank Protest to Japan, Warns of Possible Ban on Arms Exports to Japan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. According to a Tokyo dispatch, US Ambassador Grew visited Foreign Minister Nomura at his official residence at 10:10 AM today at the Foreign Minister's request and left after about an hour of conversation. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. During the decisive meeting on US-Japan relations between US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura, Grew issued a strong and frankly worded protest to the Japanese side. Grew mentioned the general dissatisfaction of the United States with Japan. It is heard that Grew emphasized to Foreign Minister Nomura the importance of US public opinion toward Japan and warned the Japanese Foreign Minister that unless relations between the two countries improve immediately, the US Congress may impose a ban on arms exports to Japan. Grew claimed that the current US-Japan situation is very serious, and that if Japan does not improve relations between the two countries, relations between the two countries will deteriorate further. Grew urged Nomura to pay attention to the regular session of the US Congress, which will be convened in January next year, and predicted that unless US-Japan relations improve immediately, someone will propose a ban on arms exports to Japan. After expressing his impressions of US public opinion toward Japan, Grew protested the recent anti-American incidents in the occupied areas of China. He said that the United States expects the Japanese government to remedy the situation in China by "negative and positive" measures. Negative measures include stopping anti-American activities by Japanese officials and puppet regimes in China. Positive measures include concrete proof of Japan's intention to improve American rights and interests and the interests of expatriates in the Far East. General Nomura expressed his desire to reorganize Japan's relations with third countries in China. He described Japan's new policy toward China to Grew, which is to establish a "new central government" in Wang Jingwei's "government." Wang will use the old Kuomintang flag as the "leader of the True Kuomintang." (2) Japan recognizes the "government in power" and "Manchukuo." (3) Negotiations will begin with the Chongqing National Government based on the Konoe Declaration of December 1938. (4) Japan will ease its attitude toward third countries in China. The meeting between Ambassador Grew and Foreign Minister Nomura this morning lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. Both sides agreed to issue a statement to reporters. The Japanese side claimed that today's meeting "included the overall relationship between Japan and the United States and was conducted in an atmosphere of mutual assistance." Japanese officials regarded the US-Japan talks as informal and said that the talks should not be regarded as formal negotiations between the United States and Japan. (4th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. US Ambassador to Japan Grew had a long meeting with Foreign Minister Nomura today. It is heard that what Grew talked to Nomura today was no different from his public remarks on October 19, and he cited cases of the Japanese army in China destroying and interfering with American rights. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The decisive meeting on the Far Eastern situation between the United States and Japan was held here today by US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister General Kichisaburo Nomura. Grew went to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM (Tokyo time) and began talks with the Japanese Foreign Minister to determine the future relationship between the United States and Japan. The holding of this decisive negotiation is the result of Ambassador Grew's recent speech in Tokyo. Grew frankly informed the Japanese people that the United States understands the meaning of Japan's "New Order in East Asia," but the United States does not approve of it, because this policy seems to include attacks on US policy in the Far East. The Japanese Foreign Minister will propose to the United States to conclude a new treaty of commerce to replace the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, which was recently abolished by the Washington government. It is believed that Ambassador Grew will seek a satisfactory response from the Japanese side to the hundreds of protests made by the United States to Japan regarding the injuries and insults to American expatriates in China and the loss of American property in China. He will insist that the Japanese side remove commercial restrictions in China as a prerequisite for the conclusion of a new commercial treaty between the United States and Japan.

<h3>Analysis of the Balkan Situation</h3>
<p>The Balkan Peninsula has always been known as the powder keg of the world. The Second World War has been going on for two months now. Although the Balkan countries have successively declared neutrality, can they really transcend the war and ensure their peace? To answer this question, we must first examine it from the historical development.</p>
<p>During the heyday of the Turkish Empire, the Balkan Peninsula was under its restraint. Since the 19th century, the Turkish Empire has declined, and its territory has split, forming many small countries, which are mutually exclusive and discriminatory. Until the end of the Balkan War in 1912 and the eve of the outbreak of the World War in 1914, the Balkan Peninsula was in this situation. One of the causes of the First World War was the mutual hatred of the small Balkan countries, which was instigated by ambitious powers, and it became uncontrollable.</p>
<p>At the end of the Great War in 1918, the Paris Peace Conference produced the current Balkan situation. The State of Yugoslavia is the incarnation of the old Serbia. It contains a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Greece has been quite stable since the Greco-Turkish War in 1922. Bulgaria and Turkey are both defeated countries, losing land and insulting the country. Romania was the biggest winner as a result of the Great War. At the Paris Peace Conference, she obtained good oil fields from Russia, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The newly added land is almost half of the original territory.</p>
<p>Now the Paris Peace Conference has become a historical relic. Bulgaria has little dissatisfaction with the status quo, while Russia and Hungary have been complaining from time to time. Russia. Whether under the rule of the Russian Emperor or the proletarian ruling, it has never forgotten Bessarabia, which was incorporated into Romania. Hungary has also repeatedly declared that its ethnic minorities in Romania are greatly abused, and it has always been unable to sleep or eat because of its lost land. In addition, Italy has been eyeing the Balkans since annexing Albania.</p>
<p>What can quell Hungary and the Soviet Union's attempts to reclaim lost land and Italy's ambitions? This brings us to the establishment of the Balkan League under the leadership of the emerging Turkey and the conclusion of the British-Turkish-French mutual assistance agreement. The Balkan League includes Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece. and Turkey signed a mutual assistance agreement in the capital of Yugoslavia in 1934. The agreement is of a military alliance nature. If any other Balkan country attempts to invade any of these four countries, the four countries will jointly resist it. Until today, the alliance of these four countries has maintained Balkan order and peace to a certain extent on the surface. However, if Romania is once subjected to pressure from Hungary, Germany, or the Soviet Union, can the signatory countries of the Balkan League really go to help? It is difficult to answer this question with certainty. Therefore, under the current situation, the Balkan League alone is not enough to maintain Balkan peace.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the conclusion of the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement in Ankara, Turkey, on the 16th of last month greatly enhanced the security of Southeastern Europe. Article 2 of the agreement states: "Turkey will assist the Allied Powers (Great Britain and France) in fulfilling their guarantee to Romania and Greece." On the other hand, since Turkey, Romania and Greece are also signatory countries of the Balkan League, it is virtually pulling Yugoslavia into the scope of British and French guarantees. Article 3 of the agreement states: "Regarding the Balkan issue, the three countries of Great Britain, France and Turkey shall consult with each other in advance," which has made Turkey grasp the key to the Balkans and become its arbitrator. Therefore, under the current Balkan situation. The British-French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is really the biggest factor in stabilizing Southeastern Europe after the Balkan League. Recently, Italy and Greece exchanged documents, reaffirming their friendship, as a foundation for the establishment of the Balkan Neutral Group, which can be said to be directly to deter the intrusion of German and Soviet forces, and indirectly promoted by the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement. However, Italy took a step ahead of Britain and France. If it blindly regards itself as the leader of the Balkans, it will only see its dreams.</p>
<p>According to a London telegram yesterday, German Aviation Minister Goering, under the order of Hitler, will go to Rome on the 7th of this month to visit Mussolini and make a suggestion that he is willing to cooperate with Italy in the Balkans, which shows that Germany also has great ambitions for the Balkans. According to a Moscow telegram, the Soviet Union will reopen negotiations with Turkey. In this way, there are many changes in the future of the Balkans, and it is unpredictable whether there will be unexpected twists and turns.</p>
<h3>Balkan Group of Neutral Nations Formed to Prevent German and Soviet Expansion; Diplomatic Contacts Underway Among Relevant Countries; Italy Effectively in a Leading Position</h3>
<p>Belgrade – According to well-informed sources in the Yugoslav capital, Romania recently initiated the expansion of the Balkan Entente (comprising Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey) to include Bulgaria or even Hungary, forming a group of neutral nations. Diplomatic contacts have begun among the relevant countries. The Yugoslav envoy to Bulgaria recently returned to the country to report on his duties and will consult with Yugoslav diplomatic authorities on this matter. The Romanian envoy to Yugoslavia was also summoned home to meet with Romanian envoys to various Balkan countries, presumably to discuss the same issue. Essentially, this group of neutral nations may center around Italy. However, as of now, Italian authorities have not yet engaged in contact with Yugoslavia. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome – Foreign observers here state that Italy is actively engaging with neutral nations in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula, aiming to form a bloc under Italian leadership. In essence, Italy seeks to establish a strong group of neutral nations to prevent Germany and the Soviet Union from expanding their influence into Southeastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The recent exchange of notes between the Italian government and Greece, reaffirming friendship, also serves this purpose. However, Italy will undoubtedly encounter significant difficulties in pursuing this strategy, particularly regarding Romania. Hungary and Bulgaria both have territorial claims on Romania, and since Romania is unwilling to concede, it will be difficult to establish a lasting agreement between them. Secondly, the Soviet Union might one day shift its attention and take action regarding Bessarabia, at which point Romania would inevitably resist. If so, this nascent group of neutral nations would inevitably collapse. Thirdly, Romania and Greece have both accepted guarantees from Britain and France, which conflicts with the principle of strict neutrality, also hindering the organization of a group of neutral nations. Furthermore, considering Italy itself, there is a major obstacle that is difficult to resolve. At the beginning of the European war, Italy declared a policy of "wait and see," thus remaining potentially able to join either side of the warring nations. This naturally makes the neutral nations in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula uneasy and unwilling to be bound in advance. Some countries have even stated that Italy cannot be regarded as a strictly neutral nation until it formally declares its strict neutrality. For these reasons, Italian diplomatic authorities may abandon the idea of organizing a large-scale group of neutral nations and instead focus on rallying Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece to form a smaller, simpler group with Albania, excluding Romania and Turkey. The difficulties that Romania could cause have already been mentioned, and Turkey has a mutual assistance pact with Britain and France. It is also generally said that once this new group is established, Italy will effectively be in a leading position, but outwardly will avoid appearing as the leader. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, under increasing criticism from high-level officials, is desperately trying to draw Stalin into the war. Ribbentrop is reportedly proposing to divide the spheres of influence in the Balkans, with Germany retaining control of Hungarian territory and Romanian oil fields, and sharing influence in Yugoslavia with Italy, while ceding Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece to the Soviet Union in exchange for a Soviet military alliance.

<h3>Rumor that General Göring Will Visit Rome to Inquire About Italy's Stance</h3>
<p>Rome – "Il Popolo d'Italia" reports that German Air Minister General Göring, a close confidant of Hitler, is expected to visit Rome on November 7th. However, this has not been officially confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>London – Political figures here have commented on the rumor of German Air Minister General Göring's visit to Rome, saying that there is little doubt that the German leader Hitler will send a member of his cabinet as a plenipotentiary to Rome. Hitler urgently wants to understand the extent to which Italy's evolving policy is contrary to Germany's wishes and whether it can be persuaded to change course. He intends to send a representative to Rome to suggest to Prime Minister Mussolini that Germany is willing to cooperate with Italy in the Balkan Peninsula. However, if Germany does not send a representative, it means that Italy is unwilling to negotiate with Germany, does not need German assistance, and can pursue a policy that achieves success. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Today's "Asahi Shimbun" reports from Rome that German Air Minister General Göring is scheduled to arrive in the Italian capital on November 7th to determine whether Mussolini will mediate in accordance with the first and second clauses of the German-Italian military alliance. If Mussolini refuses, Göring will likely explore Italy's views on invoking the third clause of the alliance. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Ambassadors to Italy Return Home to Report on Their Duties</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland – A "Basler Abend-Zeitung" correspondent in Berlin reports that the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and the Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Schulenburg, returned home to report on their duties. Now, they are returning to their posts in haste. It is assumed that the government wants to convince foreign countries that the ambassadors' return home is a routine event and has no special significance, so it has ordered them to return to their positions quickly. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Soviet and Turkish Preparations to Reopen Negotiations; Romania's Participation Uncertain</h3>
<p>Moscow – There are rumors that the Soviet Union will reopen negotiations with Turkey, with Romania also participating. According to reliable sources, this is not true, at least regarding the participation of other countries. As far as Turkey is concerned, it is still prepared to reopen negotiations with the Soviet Union on issues of most immediate concern, such as the Dardanelles Strait and the Balkan Peninsula. However, the issue of Bessarabia (which belonged to Germany before the Great War and now belongs to Romania) is not considered to be within the scope of the Balkan Peninsula issue. Therefore, if the Soviet Union raises this issue, it should be resolved by Romania and the Soviet Union, without Turkey's involvement. It is worth noting that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not mention the Bessarabia issue in his recent speech. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Joint Fleet Now Holds a Decisive Advantage; German Air Raid Plan Proven a Failure; Western Front Quiet with Only Skirmishes by Reconnaissance Units</h3>
<p>London – According to observers here, the decisive superiority of the Anglo-French fleet is the reason why Germany is now unwilling to risk bombing the British fleet again. It is rumored that German Air Minister General Göring is prepared to lose a hundred bombers in exchange for a British battleship. However, Germany has a limited number of aircraft and cannot afford such a sacrifice. Britain has fourteen battleships besides the HMS "Oak" sunk, and France has seven battleships. Germany, on the other hand, has only five battleships, three of which are only pocket battleships. It is extremely difficult for Germany to reduce the number of Allied battleships to match Germany's through air strikes. The German Air Force's attacks in the Firth of Forth and the Kiaga Bay did not achieve any practical results and only resulted in the loss of more than a quarter of the aircraft used by Germany for the attacks. German fighters cannot cover the bombers because their bases are quite far away. Therefore, it is a great risk for German bombers to fly to Britain alone and they are vulnerable to attack by British fighters. The need to conserve gasoline is also a serious consideration for Germany, as twenty bombers consume one ton of fuel every ten minutes. If they fly to attack the British fleet or naval bases, they must consume thirty tons of gasoline each time. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris – French communiqué stated that the Western Front was quite quiet today, with only minor skirmishes between advance units. According to a French dispatch from the border, a certain key figure in Berlin who has arrived at the German border explained the relatively inactivity of the German army. It is claimed that the General Staff has tried to dissuade Hitler from attempting to break through the Maginot Line. Subsequently, Air Minister Göring was ordered to study a plan for a large-scale air raid on Britain. However, according to the results of the investigation, the German side must use the Belgian coast as a base in order to achieve a large-scale air raid. General Halder, the Chief of the Operations Staff of the German General Staff, then received orders to plan an attack on Belgium, but it is said that Halder could not agree with this military action and has submitted his resignation, which has not been accepted. Hitler is currently waiting for "inspiration," and is also studying the Eastern question and the possibility of returning overseas German minorities to Germany in order to obtain foreign exchange.

Since the passage of the law, American shipping companies have announced an indefinite extension of the voyages of the Washington, President Roosevelt, and American Farmer, which were scheduled to depart for Britain and France today. Company officials have further stated that unless the provisions of the law are amended, they may temporarily suspend operations pending the end of the war. Although the Neutrality Act amendments allow the vessels to depart for the ports of the belligerent countries before the law actually comes into effect, all risks are borne by the companies themselves. Other American ships sailing in the Atlantic have also been affected. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>New York – Since the Neutrality Act was passed by Congress, New York's waterfront has become bustling again today. Dozens of large trucks loaded with various military supplies destined for the Allied countries are constantly arriving at the piers. Once the bill is approved, Britain and France only need to pay in cash and transport the goods themselves, and they can freely purchase munitions from America. Ideally, Germany also has this right. As soon as the bill is approved, the Allies will ship 300 aircraft across the Atlantic to the east. Many more aircraft are awaiting shipment in New York. The State Department will reissue munitions export licenses to Britain and France, worth £20 million. It is expected that in the next few weeks, Britain and France will order military supplies worth $1 billion from American factories. The warehouses at New York's piers are now heavily guarded by a large number of police officers who patrol the area. When trucks carrying military supplies arrive, they open the gates, put the trucks inside, and then close the gates. Viewed from the outside, the warehouses are stacked with boxes. American naval personnel, in view of the fact that the piers were full of goods and there were no ships to load them during the last European war, are now trying to avoid repeating the past. British shipping personnel here are also worried about the shortage of ships for the abundance of goods. British and American shipping companies are currently negotiating emergency measures, intending to withdraw British ships operating in the South American trade to the United States, and to have American ships replace them. This would kill two birds with one stone, as British ships could carry war materials across the Atlantic, and many American merchant ships would not be idle. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – The neutrality amendment proposed by President Roosevelt has been passed by both houses of Congress. The President expressed his great pleasure last night, saying, "The United States has regained its historical neutrality." The President will consult with the Secretary of State to issue the various orders implementing this new neutrality law. When asked whether the US government had recalled Ambassador Steinhardt to the Soviet Union because of the "City of Flint" incident, the President replied, "I should not treat bad attitudes with bad attitudes." As for the warning from German Navy Commander Raeder to the US government regarding the American ship "Iraquois," the President said that this matter would become a mystery. Regarding whether the eighty German ships currently in American ports would sail in the safety zone in the Panama Declaration in order to avoid attacks from Britain and France, the President replied that this was extremely difficult to predict, and even sailing in that zone could not guarantee absolute safety. The President will go to Hyde Park to spend the weekend later today or tomorrow morning. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt's foreign policy has now achieved a great victory. The new Neutrality Act has passed the final draft in both houses of Congress and has been sent to the White House for the President's signature. This Neutrality Act was passed by the House of Representatives after it was passed by the Senate, and was immediately approved. The joint conference of the two houses only convened for two and a half hours to decide on the final draft. Congress sent this final draft to the White House and adjourned at 6:35 p.m., to reconvene in January next year. The important points of this new Neutrality Act include the following: (1) The arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Act is repealed; (2) American merchant ships are not allowed to trade with belligerent countries, except for Australia, South Africa, and Hong Kong; (3) Belligerent countries must "pay cash and carry" when purchasing arms from the United States; (4) American merchant ships are not allowed to carry passengers to belligerent countries, except for areas far from the European theater of war; (5) The President may prohibit American ships and Americans from entering war zones at any time; (6) American merchant ships may have small-scale armaments; (7) Americans may not donate to belligerent countries, except for charitable relief; (8) The President may order belligerent countries' ships not to use American ports, including submarines and armed merchant ships; (9) Foreign merchant ships are not allowed to fly the American flag; (10) This new Neutrality Act is not implemented when American republics are independently fighting non-American countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – The Neutrality Act amendment was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 243 to 172. Those who voted in favor included 223 Democratic Party members, 19 Republican Party members, 1 Labor Party member, and 1 Farmer-Labor Party member. Those who voted against included 141 Republican Party members, 29 Democratic Party members, and 2 Progressive Party members. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Neutrality Act Only Applies to Europe</p>
<p>Washington – During the debate on the new American Neutrality Act in Congress, there were many who wanted to involve the Sino-Japanese issue as well. However, supporters of the government have always believed that this case only applies to Europe and does not apply to the Far East. The application of the various clauses of the Neutrality Act depends on "whether a state of war exists," and the power to decide whether a state of war exists rests with the President and Congress of the United States. If the President and Congress of the United States believe that a state of war does not exist, then the Neutrality Act does not apply. (Associated Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>A Great Harvest for Britain and France</p>
<p>Paris – After the US Senate and House of Representatives passed the Neutrality Act amendments, all the morning newspapers here unanimously praised it, saying that this move was a great harvest for the Allied countries of Britain and France, and one of the most important events in history and morality, and a great victory for President Roosevelt personally. This is because President Roosevelt's policy has been endorsed by the country's Congress and general public opinion. "L'œuvre," the newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, published an editorial saying that President Roosevelt had been advising his countrymen for several years that it would be difficult for the United States to completely ignore any war in any part of the world, and only now has he achieved success. In fact, Americans maintain fairness to resist unfairness, protect the invaded to resist the aggressor, which is morally right, and for the benefit of the United States, it is not convenient to allow certain countries to spread certain theories in the world. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that "President Roosevelt's policy is completely consistent with the neutrality advocated by American public opinion and its sympathy for Britain and France." "Le Temps" reported that "Although we can obtain assistance from the United States, we must still strive to develop our national armaments industry and not be negligent. Although the new American neutrality law contains cash and carry clauses, we must take care of the original reserves and the original military strength, and not exchange all the reserves for American kerosene and steel, or mass assistance is an essential factor in winning, but it is not enough to win victory. In short, victory must be sought on the battlefield, this point must be remembered by the people of the country." "Le Journal" reported that "Since the outbreak of the war, there have been many countries that have expressed friendship with Britain and France. The current attitude of the United States is a serious blow to Germany and the Soviet Union." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Roosevelt Praised by Public Opinion</p>
<p>New York – After the Senate and the House of Representatives successively voted on the Neutrality Act amendments, all the morning newspapers here praised them, saying that President Roosevelt contributed the most. The Democratic "New York Times" reported that the members of Congress were able to have a broad vision and remove party prejudices when discussing the case, which was due to the great power of the President. The President acted quickly and was very mild in his recommendations to the members of Congress, and he did not put pressure on the Senate and the House of Representatives. Afterwards, he tried to make the discussion relatively calm and mild. The Republican "New York Herald Tribune" criticized the attitude of certain Republican members of Congress, saying, "The actions taken by the majority of Republican members of Congress in the Senate and the House of Representatives are not what we can agree with. They insisted on their own opinions when discussing such an important foreign policy issue, as if they were discussing domestic affairs, which is regrettable. We firmly believe that the people of the country all support the President's current policy." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Government Able to Control Both Houses</p>
<p>New York – According to the New York Times, the majority of members of Congress believe that the abolition of the arms embargo can shorten the period of the European war, thereby reducing the risk of the United States participating in the war. At the same time, according to the newspaper's Washington correspondent, the most noteworthy feature of this special session of Congress is the renewed demonstration of the government's ability to control both houses of Congress. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Britain Orders Huge Amount of Armaments</p>
<p>London – Minister of Munitions Burgin told the press that since the outbreak of the war, the Ministry has ordered various armaments worth a total of £110 million. "Once the US arms embargo clause is definitely abolished, the armaments needed by the Allied countries of Britain and France can be supplied continuously without fear of shortage."

<h3>United States Implements Panama Convention Declaration; State Department Reaffirms Key Points of the Declaration</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters today that the Panama Convention Declaration on establishing a neutral zone in the Western Hemisphere has now been implemented. According to information obtained here, those currently patrolling this area are: (1) the United States patrols the North Atlantic and North Pacific; (2) Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina patrol the east coast of South America; (3) Chile and Ecuador patrol the west coast of South America. The State Department stated that this declaration does not contain any intention of the United States of America to use force. The purpose of the patrol is to enable the governments of the American countries to obtain information on what is discovered in this restricted area. According to official opinion, if warships of belligerent countries are indeed active in this area, the governments of the American countries will make diplomatic representations to the countries that have violated this area. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington – The US State Department finally issued a formal statement today, which can be regarded as an interpretation of the Panama Declaration. The statement does not include any new points of view, nor does it resolve the various technical issues that have arisen due to the implementation of the provisions of the Panama Declaration. These issues should be negotiated and resolved with the belligerent countries at any time when an event occurs. The explanatory statement stated that the US government, in accordance with the provisions of the Panama Declaration, controls the neutral zone around the Americas and is not prepared to take any aggressive action. The purpose of the patrol plan is to control events occurring in the neutral zone. The statement further clearly stated the three objectives of the Panama Declaration: (1) the safety and protection of shipping between American seaports; (2) the possibility of peaceful neutrality; (3) the safety of the people of the American countries.

<h3>Soviet Demands Unsatisfied; Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Not Optimistic; Finland Expresses Determination to Defend Freedom; Nation Prepares for All Contingencies</h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet-Finnish talks reopened last night at the Kremlin. After an hour of discussion, the Finnish representatives returned to their residence. Both sides are maintaining strict secrecy at this time. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet-Finnish negotiations held at the Kremlin yesterday afternoon lasted only an hour. The Soviet side was represented by Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Minister Potemkin, while the Finnish side was represented by delegation leader Paasikivi and Director of Protocol Hakarinen. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The newspaper "Political Report" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in the Finnish capital stating that after the chief Finnish delegate, Paasikivi, presented new proposals to the Soviet authorities, a phone call was received from the Kremlin late into the night with questions regarding certain key points. After each point was explained in detail, the sound of commotion was heard, presumably as the Soviet government officials were discussing the Finnish proposals in Stalin's office. As of 3:30 AM today (Moscow time), the Soviets had not yet given an answer. Finnish officials are anxious and pessimistic. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Political figures here believe that the Soviet-Finnish negotiations are likely to break down. It is said that during yesterday's hour-long negotiations at the Kremlin, Finnish Envoy Paasikivi continued to explain Finland's proposals. He stated that Finland was prepared to accept two-thirds of the Soviet demands, but that the issue of naval bases in the Gulf of Finland would greatly damage Finland's territorial integrity and should be discussed at length. The delegation did not set a time for continued negotiations when leaving the Kremlin. It is believed here that Molotov's report to Stalin on the negotiations today will determine whether further talks will continue. Finnish officials still hope for continued negotiations to seek a peaceful resolution. The Finnish proposals will not be made public until the negotiations have either succeeded or broken down. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko declared today when meeting with foreign reporters that the Soviet Union's accusation that Finland was preparing for war was unjust. Finland has repeatedly expressed its desire for peace and has made every effort to concede in response to Soviet proposals. The Finnish representatives met with Soviet leaders in Moscow tonight, and Finland has presented a counterproposal and is now awaiting the Soviet response. The Foreign Minister added that Finland has accepted two-thirds of the Soviet proposals in revised and provisional form. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to news from Helsinki received here today, Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko stated in an interview with reporters that the Soviet Union cannot expect to have 100% of its demands met. There are certain issues we cannot discuss, and we cannot wait indefinitely for the Soviet response. If a response cannot be obtained in a short period of time, the Finnish delegation will return home. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Regarding the situation of the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland, the Moscow correspondent of the "Political Report" recently reported that although the Soviet authorities are striving to find a reconciliation plan, foreign observers ultimately fear that the country will send troops into the territory it covets and forcibly compel Finland to accept a fait accompli. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Prime Minister Cajander delivered a radio address this morning concerning the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, stating that Finland is determined to defend its freedom and neutrality. "We still hope for a peaceful resolution to the current issues. When necessary, the Finnish people also know to strengthen their unity to cope with all contingencies." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Government authorities recently used wireless broadcasting to issue a notice to the nation, appealing to the people to remain calm and disciplined under the current circumstances, and stating that the government has taken various air defense measures, which are necessary in both peacetime and wartime. Residents of major cities should form groups to prepare food and clothing in order to cope with all contingencies. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>The Hague: German newspapers have recently published detailed reports on Finland's mineral resources, with particular emphasis on the nickel mines in the Petsamo region. It is said that the mining rights have been granted to the International Nickel Company of Canada for a period of eighty years. The ore reserves total five million tons, containing 2% pure nickel. The town of Kolosyoki near the mining area, originally a small village, has now become a "nickel city" due to the development of mining. Foreign observers, based on this report, speculate that the Soviet Union must be coveting Finland's mineral resources in the current negotiations with Finland. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Madrid: A local newspaper recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent with a large headline discussing the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, stating, "The Soviet Union is a large country with a population of 180 million, more than forty times that of Finland's mere four million. Yet it claims to be threatened by Finland and seeks to prevent it, thus demanding the revision of the existing borders and the cession of certain islands by Finland. Is this not a strange thing?" It is noteworthy that this dispatch was not detained by the German censorship authorities. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Molotov's Diplomatic Remarks Deemed Inappropriate by Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Washington: Representative McCormack, a Democratic member of the House, spoke in the House on November 1, advocating for the recall of the ambassador to Moscow because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made remarks criticizing the US President in the Supreme Soviet. President Roosevelt criticized this proposal today, stating that while he thought Molotov's behavior was inappropriate, the United States should not respond in kind. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>"City of Flint" Regains Freedom to Navigate; German Ship Detained by Norwegian Authorities; Germany Lodges Verbal Protest with Norway</h3>
<p>Oslo: The Naval Department recently issued a public announcement stating, "The American freighter 'City of Flint' was being navigated by German sailors. Our government has granted the ship permission to sail south within its territorial waters from Drøbak. It arrived in Haugesund yesterday afternoon accompanied by ten of our warships. Without official permission, it anchored in the port. Our authorities, in view of the fact that the ship had no reason to dock, decided to detain it, hand it back to the American crew, and release it. All German sailors on board have been detained." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>London: According to news received from Clydeside, the American ship "City of Flint" has sailed to a port on the west coast of Scotland. It is generally expected that the ship will enter dock in Glasgow within four days for repairs. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Regarding the release of the American freighter "City of Flint" by the Norwegian authorities, the State Department received a telegram late yesterday evening from the envoy to Norway, Mrs. Harriman, stating that the host government has returned the ship to the American crew, allowing it to raise the American flag again. According to a report from the consul in Bergen, the ship, navigated by German sailors, sailed into Norwegian waters after the German captain requested permission from the Norwegian authorities to anchor in Haugesund to send sick American sailors ashore for treatment. The Norwegian Naval Department immediately dispatched a medical officer to examine them. The report stated that the sailors were not seriously ill and that there was no real need for the ship to dock. Based on this report, the naval authorities rejected the captain's request. Unexpectedly, the captain refused to comply and sailed into the port without permission. Therefore, in accordance with international law, all German sailors were detained and the ship was released. People here, who were anxious about the lives of the American crew, were very pleased upon hearing the news and praised the courage of the Norwegian government. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Officials here have expressed satisfaction with the news of the Norwegian authorities releasing the American ship "City of Flint". According to non-official sources, Norway's actions are consistent with the United States' interpretation of international law and the documents the US sent to the Soviet Union when the ship was detained in Murmansk. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: It has been officially confirmed that the Norwegian naval chief in Haugesund detained the German sailors and returned the American ship "City of Flint" to the American sailors. The news has attracted the attention of political figures here. The US State Department has instructed the embassy in Norway to investigate and report back. Political circles here believe that the Norwegian authorities' attitude stems from Norway's desire to maintain friendly relations with the United States. Norway's profits from transporting munitions from the US to Europe alone are considerable. Norway's affinity with the US is not accidental. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared today that the German government has lodged a verbal protest with the Norwegian government regarding the detention of the crew of the American ship "City of Flint" by the Norwegian naval authorities. It is claimed that the German captain who captured the ship ordered the ship to dock in a Norwegian port because one of the American sailors on board was seriously ill and in need of treatment. The German government had received an appeal from US President Roosevelt to pay attention to the welfare of the American sailors. Therefore, the ship's docking in a Norwegian port was entirely based on humanitarian grounds. Berlin officials expressed outrage at the news that the ship's sailors had been detained by the Norwegian authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: The German government has formally notified the United States that it will protect the safety of the crew of the American ship "City of Flint". The US Chargé d'Affaires in Germany wired the US State Department that the German naval authorities have been instructed to respect the US government's expressed wish not to subject the crew to unnecessary danger. After being captured by a German warship, the ship was sailed to the Soviet port of Murmansk and detained for several days. It is now being escorted by the German captor ship to a German port. It is reported that the ship was found sailing south in Norwegian territorial waters. It is likely that the "City of Flint" will continue to sail in Norwegian and Swedish territorial waters until it enters the Baltic Sea. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>German-Soviet Trade Negotiations Sure to Succeed; Transportation No Problem</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to Mr. Zongqi, chairman of the Soviet-German Trade Commission, the rumor that the Soviet Union cannot fully supply Germany's needs does not correspond to the facts. "Moreover, if the Soviet Union has been able to provide Germany with sufficient supplies in the past, why can it not provide even more in the future?" According to German trade circles, the Soviet Union has ordered many goods from Germany, mainly railway cars and electrical wires. According to German Transport Minister Daumer, rail traffic between the Soviet Union and Germany has been established, with abundant trains, and transportation will not be a problem. At the same time, German engineers are working to improve water transport within Poland to help solve transportation problems between the Soviet Union and Germany. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>Thousands of Japanese Troops Increase Harassment in Chaozhou and Shantou; Puppet Troops Defend the Rear of Chenghai and Shantou; Japanese Army Plans Full-Scale Attack on Jieyang</h3>
<p>Correspondent in Shantou: Japanese troops invading Guangdong Province have secretly transferred troops south from Taiwan and Shanghai recently, reportedly to consolidate the outer defense lines of Guangzhou, Shantou, and occupied areas to support the existence of the puppet regime. It is reported that since mid-October, more than 10,000 newly arrived Japanese and puppet troops in Guangzhou have opened Chiwan in Baoan County as a military port, and built military airfields in Shenzhen and Taiping. The newly arrived Japanese and puppet troops disembark at Baoan, Dongguan, Humen, Huangpu, and in the dark of night, and then transfer to Conghua, Huaxian, Foshan, Sanshui, Jiangmen, Xinhui, and other places to deploy defenses. The number of newly arrived Japanese and puppet troops in Chaozhou and Shantou is five or six thousand, divided into several batches, transported to Nan'ao Island by transport ships. It is reported that there is a wireless station on Nan'ao Mountain, which reports to Taiwan and Shantou every day. Japanese ships on the South China Sea listen to the command of the radio station. A small Japanese aircraft carrier and three destroyers are docked in the Houzhai sea area. When Japanese transport ships arrive at Nan'ao, they stop in the Qianjiang sea area. When transporting troops and ammunition, there must be two or three aircraft flying to provide cover. Qianjiang is very close to Longao. The nearby salt fields have long been converted by the Japanese army into an amphibious airfield, with an area of one mile in diameter and two miles in width. The strong men forcibly conscripted by the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou must first be transported to Longao for centralized training, and then transferred to Tianjin and Shanghai to supplement the Japanese army's vacancies. Japanese and puppet troops reinforced from various places in Chaozhou and Shantou also arrive in Longao first to be assigned and issued weapons, and then transferred by steamboats and shallow-draft ships to land at Chenghai's northern and southern ports, Waisha, and Chaoyang Dameng. The time of landing is also at night, and each landing is less than a thousand people. The quality is very complicated. There are sick and wounded soldiers who have just come out of Taiwanese hospitals, with yellow faces and swollen feet, and bandages still wrapped around their arms. There are Mongolian bearded soldiers riding tall, long-necked horses. There are also strong men who look like those from North China, wearing cotton-padded jackets inside their military uniforms. The weather in Chaozhou and Shantou in September is still hot, so it is rare to see people wearing short cotton-padded jackets at this time. There are also strong men from Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde counties in Guangdong Province wearing rubber silk shirts and trousers. Their ages vary greatly. With such a military appearance, it is no wonder that they dare not land in the daytime to avoid the Chinese army knowing their weaknesses. Chenghai City was originally guarded by more than 200 Japanese troops, and there were 100 to 200 troops stationed in Waisha, Ouding, and Shangpeng. After mid-October, puppet troops were stationed instead. The puppet troops issued notices, claiming to be the "Peace Salvation Army," distributed in villages along the Shantou-Chenghai highway, with a total of 1,600 people. At present, the Japanese army is focusing all its efforts on the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway. The newly arrived troops are transferred from Chenghai to Anbu, establishing their headquarters in the city of Taihe. The headquarters of the puppet Peace Salvation Army is located in Jiansheng Hospital in Chenghai City. The puppet troops recruited by the Japanese in Chaozhou and Shantou in the past are all transferred to Chenghai and reorganized under the puppet Peace Salvation Army to prevent the guerrillas of Liu Zhilu's troops from attacking the rear of Shantou and Chenghai from Zhanglin and Donglong.</p>
<p>The strength of the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou has increased to more than 10,000 people. Anbu and Chaoan are the largest strongholds for the Japanese army, and Caitang City, Guanchao, Wuyang, Fuyang, Jinshi, Yunbu, and Gezhou are small strongholds. Large strongholds have about three to four thousand troops stationed, and small strongholds have four to five hundred troops stationed. In the past, because they were attacked by the Chinese security guerrillas, they built mortar positions around the periphery of each stronghold, built of steel plates mixed with foreign cement. In the middle of the positions, three or four trenches were added, each with barbed wire to block traffic. At the sound of gunfire, electricity is released. Every household in the villages, both men and women, young and old, must send one person to help the Japanese army build roads and fortifications. All gun muzzles face west, targeting Sangpu Mountain and Anjie Road, and the back relies on the tributaries of the Han River for cover. All the large and small fishing boats, ferries, and cargo ships from Chaoan to Chengshan have been detained by the Japanese army and dragged into the port of Shantou. Within a hundred miles, no boats or rafts are seen. All the river surfaces near the Shantou-Jieyang wharf, Xialing Port, Zhongshan Park, and the railway station are filled with boats of all sizes, so that one can see the boats but not the water. The boatmen are detained, and each is given a salted fish and two milk cans of white rice every day, and they are not allowed to go ashore. The puppet soldiers guarding the boats told the boatmen, "You are waiting for orders to depart. From the day of departure, you will be paid five cents to one yuan per day." It is probably referring to the attack on Jieyang. To prevent the Chinese army from attacking Chaozhou City eastward along the Fengshun Huanggang River, on the 19th, 200 cavalrymen were sent to ride daily on the embankment from Zhugaoshan to the North Gate. There were also motor vehicles transporting ammunition along the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway to Yixi Station. According to the Japanese army's plan, if the defenses of Zhugaoshan and Bijia Mountain are consolidated and Chaoan has no worries, troops can be divided into three routes, by water and land, to attack Jieyang City. According to the puppet army's information, the Japanese army is responsible for defending the rear of Shantou and Chenghai, and all those who attack Jieyang are Japanese troops. Commandant Goto of Chaoan is said to be feigning an attack from the front of Anjie Road, and Commandant Horino of Anbu is detouring past Pengzhou (behind Sangpu Mountain) to cover the navy's motorboat team in attacking the forts of Quxi and Fengkou, attempting to eliminate the water blockade line of the Tuojiang River Basin. Another army secretly assembles in Nan'ao to await orders. Once the war begins, they will invade Chaoyang Guiyu Guanbu to enter Puning Qiaozhu Lihu, cutting off the retreat of the Chinese army in Jieyang Mianhu. The purpose of this decision to use troops is to block Tangkeng, the transportation hub of Chaozhou and Meizhou, so that the occupied area of Chaozhou and Shantou will not be threatened from the side, and to seize rice and agricultural products in Jieyang.</p>
<h3>Ding Songsheng of Dinghai Killed by Students; Ding Encroached on the Countryside and Committed All Kinds of Evil</h3>
<p>Correspondent in Dinghai: Ding Songsheng, a well-known figure in this county, is the adopted son of Ding Ziyuan, the chairman of the puppet autonomous committee. He has more than 3,000 students, distributed in Liuhong, Taohua, Xiazhi, Dengbu, Daxie, Shenshan, Xiushan, Sijiao, Huanglong, Damao, Jintang, Cezi, Changbai, Yushan, Dayangshan, and Mamut islands, and in Cenggang, Mao, Ganzhi, Baichuan, Xiaosha, Dasha, Beishan, Dongao, Dazhan, Maoyang, Pubu, Luhua, Ziwei, Wuxi, Fanhe, and Yancang. Gang, etc., Xiazhi, Ganzhi, Dengbu, Mayi, Mao, Baichuan, etc. are the most numerous, so the power is quite thick, and Ding Changxiu is good at dancing, and he has a lot of contacts with the military and police circles in Zhejiang Province. This spring, when Magistrate Su Zhide was appointed, he appointed Ding as the chief of staff of the county headquarters to assist in military and political affairs. Since the fall of Dinghai County City on June 23, Ding led his students to scatter in the countryside, preying on the villagers, and illegally collecting donations of 200 yuan per township per month. If they didn't get it, they would rob and plunder, doing everything, which was extremely hated by the public. Magistrate Su repeatedly received reports from the people and sent people to express condolences and explain the righteousness, but Ding never realized it, and became more and more intensified, arbitrarily shooting and killing anti-Japanese youths. When Magistrate Su heard the news, he thought that he was not enough for security and had more than enough to disturb the people, so he led the Self-Defense Force to suppress Ding, and fought fiercely in Ganzhi and Baichuan. Many of Ding's students were killed or injured. One part surrendered with weapons and was willing to serve the local area, while Ding dressed up as a bride in the middle of the night, escaped alone, and hid in a deep mountain in a certain township. But at midnight a few days ago, some of his students who had already surrendered used lies to lure Ding out halfway, and were immediately ambushed by students lying in ambush on the side of the road, who shot Ding violently more than ten times, hitting his head, chest, and other parts. Blood was flowing and he died instantly, leaving his body in the road. It was not until the next morning that it was seen by villagers passing by, and reported to Wang Chunshui, the head of Baichuan Township, who hired people to coffin and bury it. Those who gather people and do evil can take this as a warning.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Fake County Government Regularly Levies Land Tax, Raising the Discounted Price to Twelve Yuan</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: After the establishment of the fake county government last year, it coveted the entire county's land tax revenue. However, because the four rural areas were controlled by the Chinese army, the fake county government could not implement its tricks. Until the spring of this year, it only collected about 60,000 to 70,000. This autumn, the four rural areas had a great harvest. The fake county magistrate, Guo Zengji, summoned the fake village heads of various villages to hold the first meeting to decide on rent and tax. It was reported that it was decided at that time to set up two public warehouses in the urban area, one at Guanqian (the old site of the Tianye Bank) and one near Xumen. In the rural areas, only one was established in Mudu. The fake county government did not dare to interfere with other places such as Zhouzhuang, Chenmu, and Guangfu. The discounted price of rice for this year was specially increased, nominally to twelve yuan. In order to force the villagers to hand over rent rice, a fake tax collection police force was organized to easily exploit the villagers. However, such a high discounted price is unprecedented. The oppression of the people by the fake organization is evident.</p>
<p>Sports News - Exciting Football</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Giants Meet: Lido vs. Tung Wah, 10:30 AM This Morning at Recreation Ground, the Outcome is Related to the Leadership of Group A</h3>
<p>The two Chinese football giants, Tung Wah and Lido, are scheduled to meet at Recreation Ground at 10:30 this morning for the Western Union Group A match. The referee is Shen Huichun. Since its establishment last autumn, Lido has not met Tung Wah on the field for more than a year. Fans have been eagerly awaiting this, and they will flock to it. The clash between the two new and old strong teams is like a battle for the Chinese championship. Excitement is expected. Both sides have famous generals and equal strength. Lido's Wu Qixiang has returned to Shanghai and will replace Zhang Mingsheng in the lineup. At that time, the dragon will fight with the tiger, and Recreation Ground will be crowded with people. In the other two matches, East Celera meets St. Francis, and the West Police team meets the French Chamber of Commerce, both at the Racecourse. In the reserve group, Tung Wah faces Lax, and in Group C, Youyou faces the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, both at Jiaozhou Park. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>Before the Meeting</h3>
<p>— Zhen Chao</p>
<p>The two Shanghai Chinese football giants, Tung Wah and Lido, will meet at Recreation Ground at 10:30 this morning for the Western Union Group A match. At a time when Western teams are declining, Lido and Tung Wah are vying for the top spot. The outcome of this battle is related to the future leadership of Group A and will affect the reputation in the cup competition. Also, Lido has never met Tung Wah since its establishment. Therefore, the match is important, and excitement is expected. It will be an unprecedented event in the Chinese football world since the Anti-Japanese War. Because of the importance of winning or losing, the competition will be fierce. Given the incidents of the past Shen Garden era, we deeply expect both players to show excellent sportsmanship. Moreover, many Lido players were former teammates of Tung Wah.</p>
<p>Regarding the prediction of winning or losing, Jia Youliang said that it is fifty-fifty, which is indeed not an exaggeration. In terms of forwards, Lido's elite are Sun, Xu, and Cao, while Tung Wah's are Dai, Wan, and Jia. The midfield of Meng, Yi, Liang, and Jiang Zhaoxiang seems to be slightly better, but Cai Shengsen is also commendable. The veterans Chen Hongguang and Zhuang Youren have average experience and skills, which are better than Li Yichen and Zhang Lingeng. Goalkeeper Qin Bidao is undoubtedly above Lu Zhongen. Lido's rising star, Zheng Tongyu, is unanimously praised for his goalkeeping skills. He is a young and handsome talent who surpasses his predecessors, but it is a pity that Lido is not willing to support new talent. Therefore, in terms of opportunity, Lido's victory over Tung Wah is not necessarily guaranteed. Wan Xianghua told reporters that Tung Wah's endurance is not as good as Lido's due to insufficient training, which is also true. The number of wins and losses should be discussed separately. It would be our hope that the meeting would end in harmony, without distinction between victory and defeat, and with handshakes.</p>

The attack was blocked as soon as the game started. The French Chamber of Commerce took advantage of the wind to counterattack. Lido fought forward, and the enemy cavalry roamed horizontally. Fortunately, the goalkeeper was alert and was not attacked. Lido's Wu Qixiang went to the meeting alone and made the first contribution. Before long, the French Chamber of Commerce center Ke Keling refused to be outdone and made a tie of 1-1. After 20 minutes, Wu Qixiang made another contribution, and Lido took the lead with 2-1. Wu Jiabang tried his foot for the first time, and the ball was low and fast, hitting the enemy's goal again. Lido led 3-1 in the first half. Changing sides to fight again, Lido's offensive was fierce. Le Xiuhua shot from the left, but unfortunately, it hit the crossbar and bounced out. The French Chamber of Commerce advanced with five forwards. Lido's goalkeeper left his post, and center Ke Keling took the opportunity to break in and pushed the ball into the empty goal, 3-2. The victory still belonged to Lido. Zeng Rongzhong received a ball from the rear, turned around, and shot hard. Pan Meite failed to save it, and lost the goal, 4-2. At the mid-line, Ke Keling held the ball and passed it to Ke Keling. Ke dribbled past Zhang Mingsheng, raised his foot, and shot. The ball entered the net from the left corner, pulling back a city. Three minutes before the end, Zeng Rongzhong scored another goal, and Lido won 5-3.</p>

<h3>West Foss Yesterday's Great Victory Over North West Children</h3>
<p>6-2, First Half 1-0 Another Match Lax Wins Over Portugal</p>
<p>Yesterday's Western Union football Group A match between West Foss and North West Italy was played at Recreation Ground at 2:30 pm. There were few spectators. The Soviet army's five forwards, except for Tang Pu Xun, who still played on the left wing, had their positions changed. In the first half, North West Children competed with the defending champion. However, because of Cochrane's defection, they mistakenly sent a goal, and were at a disadvantage with 0-1. In the second half, the Soviet army's momentum was fully revealed, and Stowe scored independently. In the end, Kai Moer also suffered Cochrane's mistake. As a result, with 6-2, the Soviet army defeated North West Children. In another match at the Racecourse, Lax beat Portugal 2-1. In the first half, the Portuguese team took the lead with 1-0.</p>

<h3>Pujiang Basketball Team Lost to Bombing Yesterday, 47-32</h3>
<p>Last night, there were at least 400 people watching basketball at the China Youth Hall. As a result, the Pujiang Youth team lost to the experienced Senzha team with a score of 32-47 due to a lack of endurance. The referee was Zheng Zhifang. After the start of the game, the Senzha team scored two goals in a row. Lu ShunGen and Lu GuSui of Pujiang showed their skills and came from behind to take the lead with 6-4. In the first half, Senzha only took the lead with 20-18 by one goal. After the break, a tie of 24-24 was once created. Dong Yangfeng and Qu Xilin of Senzha became more and more fierce. Wang Shenggen had great luck. Pujiang's marksmanship gradually became chaotic and they were defeated. However, it was not easy for Shicheng to see this battle again. The team is scheduled to play against Hualian Li Zhenzhong and others again at the original location at 7 pm on Wednesday night. At that time, China Youth will sell tickets to show restrictions. The income can also be donated to the refugees. (Attached note: Zhang Banglun, the defender of Pujiang, is a newborn calf with excellent interception ability and can be cultivated. However, special attention must be paid to the shooting aspect. Also, Jia Youliang of Senzha did not appear yesterday because of the football match today. The reporter asked Captain Jia, can Tung Wah win Lido today? Jia said boldly, half and half.)</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Shaanxi Provincial Medical College: Relocated from Nanzheng Back to Xi'an to Strive for Improvement</h3>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: Shaanxi Provincial Medical College was established in September 1938. It was reorganized from the former Shaanxi Hospital and Shaanxi Provincial Advanced Midwifery Vocational School. It then recruited a new class of medical college students. The actual expenses were 6,561 yuan and 6 jiao per month. The school site was the former site of Shaanxi Provincial Advanced Midwifery School. All books, instruments, and various equipment were also completely transferred from the former Provincial Hospital and Midwifery School. In addition to some newly hired teachers, the rest were concurrently served by doctors from the Provincial Hospital and Midwifery School. Most of the students were from the province, and some were from other provinces and war zones. Earlier, Xue Jian, the former director of Shaanxi Provincial Hospital, felt the lack of medical education in the Northwest and the backwardness of the sanitation industry, and proposed to run a medical school. The provincial authorities also felt the need for medical talents during the war, and approved his request. Under the principle of increasing the provincial treasury, 3,640 yuan from the Provincial Hospital, 80% of which was 2,912 yuan, 2,100 yuan from the Midwifery School, 80% of which was 1,680 yuan, and 420 yuan jointly subsidized by the Provincial Government and the Education Department, 80% of which was 336 yuan, were used as the expenses for the future medical school. The insufficient amount was supplemented by 2,012 yuan from the temporary income of the hospital, 80% of which was 1,633 yuan and 6 jiao. Xue Jian, director of the Provincial Hospital, Chen Guiyun, director of the Midwifery School, and Luo Duanxian, supervisor of the Education Department, were appointed as preparatory committee members to start preparations. From August to the end of September, preparations were made for a month, and classes began on October 13, 1938. One month after the school started, it was moved to Nanzheng due to the situation. Nanzheng was too small and lacked housing. A few houses were borrowed from Hanzhong Joint Middle School. All equipment had to be simplified. In the past, teachers were mostly concurrently served by doctors from the affiliated hospital. Now, with the relocation to the south, doctors could not go there due to their duties. After several consultations with the professors of the Medical College of Northwest United University, they agreed to concurrently teach courses at the school. The remaining teachers were also hired in Nanzheng at any time. Classes were resumed on December 15. This spring, the Women's Normal School was borrowed as the school site, which was larger than before, and improvements were expected. Unexpectedly, Japanese planes came to invade from time to time, making it difficult to realize the original plan. Recently, it has been decided to move back to Xi'an, and a school site has been found, and classes can be moved back. More new professors will be hired to enrich the internal equipment, and efforts will also be made to improve the affiliated hospital.</p>

It is now late autumn, and the refugees are all thinly clothed and cold. In view of this, the staff and students of the schools in the city have launched a campaign to collect winter clothes and appeal for the refugees.

<h3>Finance: The Downward Trend of Exchange Rates Intensifies, Chinese Merchants Begin to Short, the US Dollar Exceeds the Nine Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listing remained unchanged. In the dark market for British and American exchange rates, the trend of excessive easing is endless, resembling the scene when exchange rates plummeted. Hong Kong brokers and overseas positions continued to sell off in huge amounts. The local Chinese merchants have also reversed their past style and aggressively shorted, causing the British gold to ease to 5 pence 5625 at the most, and the US exchange rate to exceed the 9 yuan mark, at 9.03125 yuan, creating a new recent easing price. The reason for the sharp easing has been repeatedly explained in this newspaper and will not be repeated here. However, the future is difficult to predict, but it is predicted that there may be another round of maneuvering early next week. The whole day went by, initially because overseas US and British exchange rates tightened sharply by 1.375 points, so the morning opening showed a British flat and US soft trend. Then foreign cables and American banks continued to sell in the market, coupled with Chinese merchants going short, and the price eased to 5 and a half pence, and 9.125 yuan. Later, HSBC's profit taking slightly improved, and it tightened to 5 pence 40625 and 8.96875 yuan. However, Hong Kong Telecom and Huabi continued to sell out, and the price could not be supported, reaching British gold 5 pence 5625, and US exchange rate 9.03125 yuan. The results still closed with British gold at 5 pence 5625, and US exchange rate at 9.25, a continued easing of 21875 compared to the previous day's British, and the US tightened by 34375. In terms of futures trading, there are still many buyers, but the selling price is obviously in line with the spot price. However, settling with foreign banks is still slightly separate. Spot and futures trading was still strong in the morning.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Brokers' Selling Pressure Also Surged</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London major cable was nearly 0.625 point tighter. New York silver prices were flat, London raw gold was stable, and exchange rates for British against US and against France were flat. It rose by 25 points against Shanghai. The US fell by 1.375 points against the British, large triangle against Shanghai, and small 75 points against France. The central listing of various exchanges remained the same. At the morning opening, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 5 pence 34375 and the US exchange rate at 8.875 yuan, compared to the previous close, the British was flat and the US tightened by 0.03125. It was due to the sharp fall in exchange rates. After the opening, Hong Kong Telecom came to sell, coupled with Chinese merchants aggressively shorting, and foreign banks' appetite was weak, causing the market to be quite loose. The US exchange rate broke through the 9 yuan mark. Hong Kong Telecom sold to HSBC and other foreign banks spot British gold at 5 pence 40625 and 4375. At the same time, Chinese merchants sold to Datong, Yili, and a certain bank this month's British gold at 5 pence 375 and 4375, and this month's US exchange rate from 8.9375 to 9.0625 yuan. HSBC's listing was announced without any change. The silver balance tax was announced without any increase or decrease. Thereafter, spot prices tightened again to 5 and a half pence and 9.125 yuan. Later, because the sellers saw that HSBC's appetite had improved, they temporarily hesitated to watch, causing the market to soften briefly. British gold once tightened to 5 pence 40625, and the US exchange rate also softened to 8.96875 yuan. Then Hong Kong Telecom and Chinese merchants resumed their spending spree, and foreign banks such as Huabi and a certain bank supplied strongly. Therefore, it retrended to loosen. Huabi and a certain bank, and Hong Kong Telecom sold to foreign banks and importers spot British gold from 5 pence 4375 to 5625, and spot US exchange rate from 9.03125 to loosen 25. Later, a certain bank sold to the same bank and Yili spot US exchange rate at 9.03125 yuan. It was already noon. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 5 pence 5625 and the US exchange rate at 9.25 yuan. This month's British gold was 5 pence 546875 and the US exchange rate was 9.21875 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day's spot and futures, the British eased by 21875 on average, and the US tightened by 34375. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's US Exchange Rate Tightened Slightly</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th: This morning's exchange market opened flat. The British exchange rate was unchanged. The spot US exchange rate tightened by 125, to 24.875 yuan. The spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by 4 yuan, to 276 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate tightened by half a yuan, to 105 and a half yuan. At 11:30 am, the spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1 yuan, to 275 yuan. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Exchange Rate Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 4th: Spot exchange rate eased by 125, to 5 pence 34375. Spot US exchange rate rose by 1875, to 8.875 yuan. Shanghai exchange rate rose by half a yuan, to 100 yuan and 5 jiao. The "United Banknotes" dark market was unchanged, still at 94 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. There was a market with no market in the market.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Because the foreign exchange eased very sharply, it plummeted. The supply of British and American gold pounds was very smooth. The supply of British and American gold tickets was very strong, and the appetite was weak. The US gold ticket was 11 yuan and 34 jiao in the morning, and gradually decreased thereafter. It fell to 11 yuan at noon and 10 yuan 9 jiao and 8 fen in the evening. The market for Hong Kong tickets, French franc tickets, Dutch tickets, and Annam tickets were all lacking demand yesterday and tended to decline. Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets tightened. Following the US gold ticket, they were also very weak. The demand for Japanese and other tickets was sluggish and slightly eased. The evening market was 1 yuan 3 jiao and 3 li. The supply and demand for Korean tickets was scarce, and the market situation was stable. The evening market was 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Yesterday's market prices for British and American gold pounds and British gold tickets all fell by 2 yuan. The US gold ticket fell by 6 jiao. The Hong Kong ticket fell by 1 jiao and 1 fen. The French franc ticket fell by 1 fen. The Singapore ticket fell by 1 jiao. The Annam ticket fell by 1 jiao and 5 fen. The Dutch ticket and Robbie ticket both fell by 2 jiao. The Canadian ticket fell by 5 jiao. The Philippine ticket fell by 3 jiao. Other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Gold Plunges Again - Down Over Two Hundred Dollars in Four Consecutive Days - Reduced by Two Hundred and Seventy Dollars Based on Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot dark market for cash gold continued its alarming decline. The unfavorable environment made it impossible for the gold market to recover. However, based on the exchange rate, it was still reduced by a significant two hundred and seventy dollars, which indicated that many people still held bullish sentiments. Therefore, in addition to the Hong Kong brokers' usual practice of aggressively buying, there were also numerous small and medium-sized buyers. The largest sellers during the morning session were from the Tianjin group, with gold dealers and securities brokers acting as intermediaries. The opening decline was slight, but the subsequent sharp drop in the exchange rate led gold dealers to heavily sell on behalf of the Tianjin group, causing a forty-dollar drop. However, as the foreign exchange rate softened, the Hong Kong and local brokers stepped in, pushing the price back up to three thousand five hundred and ninety dollars. But as the foreign exchange rate ultimately hardened, the Tianjin group and those with floating gains closed their positions, causing the price to plunge to three thousand five hundred and ten dollars. The market closed at three thousand five hundred and twenty dollars due to some buying by the silversmith group. In the afternoon, the off-market price weakened further, reaching the three thousand five hundred dollar threshold. Trading was brisk in the morning, with an estimated volume of one thousand five hundred taels. Silver jewelry decreased by ten dollars, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Down Another Ninety-Six Dollars</p>
<p>From the opening this morning, each bar (ten taels) initially showed a weak trend due to the continued hardening of the foreign exchange rate. A certain gold dealer took the lead in lowering the price and selling, opening the market down sixteen dollars. A certain gold dealer sold thirty taels to a securities broker for three thousand six hundred dollars. Subsequently, the price recovered by five dollars, with a gold dealer buying ten taels from a money exchange for three thousand six hundred and five dollars. Shortly after, with few buyers, the selling pressure intensified, and gold dealers and money exchanges competed to sell, gradually pushing the price down by thirty dollars. A money exchange bought twenty taels of cash gold from a gold dealer for three thousand five hundred and seventy-five dollars. Later, with the support of a certain silversmith, the price recovered to three thousand five hundred and ninety dollars. However, due to the continued hardening of the foreign exchange rate, sellers flocked to the market. A certain silversmith sold twenty taels for three thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars. At this point, a securities broker suddenly stepped in, and a certain silversmith continued to purchase, causing the price to rise again to three thousand five hundred and ninety dollars. As the buying appetite waned, the price plummeted again to three thousand five hundred and sixty-five dollars. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange rate suddenly softened, sentiment improved, and a certain money exchange and those who had shorted earlier returned to buy, causing the price to recover by twenty-eight dollars. A silversmith sold twenty taels to a money exchange for three thousand five hundred and ninety-three dollars. Afterward, the silversmiths' selling intention intensified, and the upward momentum faltered, immediately dropping by a dozen dollars. Then, news came that the foreign exchange rate had suddenly weakened again, and a certain gold dealer and securities broker competed to sell, combined with the closing of positions by those with floating gains. Added to the lack of buying interest from other groups, the price plunged by dozens of dollars. A gold dealer sold ten taels to a silversmith for three thousand five hundred and ten dollars. At noon, the silversmiths showed some buying interest, causing the price to recover slightly. The silversmiths bought twenty taels from a money exchange for three thousand five hundred and twenty dollars, marking the noon closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by ninety-six dollars compared to the previous day. It has now fallen for four consecutive days, totaling two hundred and five dollars. The fluctuation was ninety-five dollars in the morning. The selling price of cash gold from the main brand of gold dealers was ten dollars higher than the spot price, while the purchase price was reduced by more than twenty dollars. Spot gold was about fifty dollars lower than the listed price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Down Ten Dollars</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver jewelry per tael from the "Da Tong Hang" (a type of store) remained at three hundred and sixty-five dollars. At 11:30 AM, it decreased by five dollars, and at 2:50 PM, it decreased by another five dollars, resulting in a total decrease of ten dollars. The "Da Tong Hang" revised their listed price to three hundred and fifty-five dollars. The "Xin Tong Hang" (another type of store) had the same price. The purchase price was reduced by about fifteen dollars across the board.</p>
<p>English and Indian Silver Slightly Weak</p>
<p>London, 3rd: The silver market is calm, with sluggish trading. There were no changes after the close. Large bars for immediate delivery remain unchanged. Forward delivery settled at 0.625. New York silver: American spot prices remain unchanged. Bombay silver: The Indian silver market is calm. Spot prices decreased by one anna, and futures decreased by two annas. Only ten contracts were traded.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Continues to Fall by One Dollar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills continued to fall slowly. Initially, it was thirty-seven dollars per thousand, but it weakened and fell to thirty-six dollars by noon. In the afternoon, it remained at the original price, one dollar lower than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's call loan interest rate remained unchanged at one and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Food - Rice Prices Difficult to Lower Under Certain Controls</h3>
<p>Du Geng Rice: Yesterday, only twelve or thirteen truckloads of new Du Geng rice and green rice from Sujiafengjia and other places arrived. However, recently, under certain controls, the amount of goods transported out of the Hongkou district has been significant. Therefore, local shops were quite active, and buying was tight. Prices were difficult to increase and remained at the original level. Broken Rice: There was a lack of goods and no market. New Yuan opened high at twenty-six dollars and ninety cents but was mediocre. The total turnover in the city was more than eight thousand bags.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Jiangbei pointed rice is difficult to arrive in Shanghai due to high land prices in Shanghai and unresolved transportation problems. The inventory in Shanghai warehouses is insufficient, and sellers are increasingly determined to hold. Yesterday morning, local merchants continued to inquire, and the rice was also exchanged between merchants, so the market's rice was quickly sold out. A total of no less than three thousand bags were traded. However, the market was affected by Jingwu pointed rice, and the price increased by two to three cents compared to the previous market. The closing price for high-quality rice was twenty-one dollars and sixty cents, and the price for medium and inferior rice was twenty-one dollars and thirty cents. Since the East Wuhu pointed rice is under certain controls, traders find it difficult to grasp the situation and rarely import it. However, it once followed Jiangbei pointed rice in the early market, but eventually, East vendors sold at high prices. It was also reported that more than five thousand bags of goods had been transported by truck, but they could not match Jiangbei pointed rice in quality. The same was true for Luyang pointed rice.</p>
<h3>Flour Lacks Vitality - Wheat Arrivals Scarce, Transactions Halted</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market remained largely unchanged. Due to the weekend, there was no strong demand in the local retail market. Most purchases were limited to dozens or hundreds of bags. Buyers intended to suppress prices, while factories maintained their selling prices due to the high cost of raw materials. The prices of Red and Blue Car and Green Soldier Ship flour remained at the original price of seven dollars and forty cents, and Cannon Car flour was seven dollars and fifty cents. A total of more than twenty thousand bags were traded throughout the day. Today, one thousand bags of flour are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's arrivals remained scarce. As sources from various production areas were obstructed and the inventory in Shanghai was dwindling, merchants were unwilling to sell lightly. However, factories did not have a strong need. As a result, the market was halted and lacked transactions. The market was also halted due to sellers refusing to sell, resulting in no trading.</p>
<h3>Securities - Speculation Focused on Foreign Stocks - Swedish Rong and Yiasong Strongly Increase - The Rise in Foreign Debt Has Ceased</h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market for securities saw some short covering by scattered short positions, while short selling remained quite active. However, the prevailing environment and rumors caused widespread anxiety, and most bulls were ready to liquidate at any opportunity, preventing prices from rising and remaining in a hovering, brewing state. The future was difficult to predict. Yesterday morning, Tong Kang Sheng Da and Da Feng tended to sell, while No. 4 and Da Tong took the opportunity to buy slightly, supporting the market and leading to a slightly firmer noon closing. In the afternoon, the market turned weak again, and retail bulls gradually sold off, while Hongda Lianhe absorbed some, resulting in a relatively balanced supply and demand. Therefore, the trend was largely unchanged, with only slight gains of five to two and a half cents. The turnover was fifty million dollars. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transaction: Thirty shares of Shanghai Datung Wah Huo Chai Company stock were traded at a price of sixteen dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Securities Association reported that the stock market was active again. Swedish Rong and Yiasong stocks were stronger than usual, with the former rising sharply by seventeen and a half dollars and the latter jumping to one hundred and ninety and a half dollars, both closing at high prices. Other stocks were also quite firm, with varied but high prices. However, the attraction of rubber stocks remained insufficient.</p>
<p>Also, news has been that Chinese merchants' speculation has been focused on foreign industrial and commercial stocks for a long time. Recently, as foreign exchange rates have eased, the foreign stock market has become very active. Some knowledgeable people believe that the rising prices of company stocks have shifted from investment to speculation. In the past, stock market rushes were mostly caused by excessive speculation. This time, it may not be so worrisome, but for the sake of the financial security of the market, it is still advisable to maintain normal business practices.</p>
<p>London, 3rd: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt have calmed down, with only top-tier bonds showing a slight continuation of the rise. The Anglo-German continued loan rose (English issue) rose by two pounds to a price of fifty-three. The Crisp loan rose by one pound to a price of twenty-seven pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 3rd: Today's market prices of British Far East company stocks continued to rise. The Mercantile Bank of India, London and China stock rose again by seven shillings and sixpence to eight pounds twelve shillings and sixpence. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's London registered stock rose by one and a half pounds, and the Hong Kong registered stock also rose by half a pound, with both prices being eighty-two and a half pounds. The Kula Kelin Rubber stock rose by seven pence to eighteen shillings and one penny. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Local Cotton Stagnant - Foreign Cotton Improves - The Consequences of Easing Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Transactions in local cotton are becoming increasingly stagnant due to the extended exchange rates and recent high prices. At the same time, yarn sales are sluggish, and market prices are inflexible, hindering factory costs. There is little incentive to purchase, resulting in a halt in activity. In addition, the industry's activity has been greatly reduced due to the above situation. From the Subei source, 1,494 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived. Only 100 bales of current cotton were purchased by the same industry's Tongzhou cotton at a price of one hundred and thirty-one dollars and fifty cents, paid by banknotes in storage. Otherwise, there was no trading.</p>
<p>Another message is that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is improving. Recently, with the easing of exchange rates, factories can still make a slight profit per bale after purchasing raw cotton and spinning yarn. Factories have stopped purchasing for several months. Currently, factory inventories are running low, and there is a strong desire to purchase. The industry also intends to move after a long period of inactivity. Recently, purchase intentions from all parties have been strong, and several thousand bales have been ordered. Trading will continue to be active in the future.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially quiet. Later, due to the increasing sales of cloth, spot transactions greatly increased. After the passage of the Neutrality Act, the securities market was firm, and sentiment was unusually excited. As a result, cotton market closing prices rose by fifteen or sixteen British pounds. Indian cotton, together with top-grade cotton, rose by more than two rupees. Egyptian cotton was unchanged. Liverpool rose by more than ten pence.</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market is Desolate and Miserable - Double Globe Drops Another Ten Dollars</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains desolate. The continuous rise in foreign exchange rates has dealt a severe blow to sentiment, leaving speculators with no opportunity to profit. As for actual sales, there is very little activity. The price of legal tender in South China is high, and the decline in Hong Kong dollars makes it uneconomical to purchase goods in Shanghai. Secondly, the authorities have tightened controls on remittances. Thirdly, the overall market is still depressed, and inventories have not been cleared. The yarn market is in a terrible situation under these circumstances. Recently, there has been some demand from Eastern Zhejiang, but the market is narrow.</p>
<p>In the current yarn market, some floating accounts, seeing the poor environment, suddenly closed positions and sold ten bales of 20-count Double Globe yarn at a price of six hundred and five dollars, a sudden drop of ten dollars. At this time, the public said it was a bargain, and the price of Double Horse foreign warehouse goods fell by ten dollars to six hundred and thirty dollars. Shortly after, speculators, seeing the extreme decline, came to buy a few more bales and added to their positions, immediately rebounding a few dollars to six hundred and thirty-eight dollars. However, foreign exchange rates were high and rising. It was heard that the market had weakened again after the close. The total volume traded in the morning was only 428 bales, compared to 215 bales on the previous day. Prices: 20-count Double Horse fell by two dollars, Heavenly Maiden fell by one dollar, and Double Globe fell by ten dollars. The quantities purchased by various groups are listed below.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains - Soybean Outlets Narrow</h3>
<p>Since the source of soybeans has increased sharply, the market atmosphere is lax, and the market is declining. Compared with the peak, it has fallen by one dollar. Yesterday, it fell by a few cents. Although there are export and local sales activities in the sales market, the outlets are narrow. The total market traded two trucks of Bengbu beans at a price of thirteen dollars, thirty-five cents, four hundred bags of Taicang beans at fourteen dollars twenty-five cents to fourteen dollars forty cents, one hundred and ninety bags of Nanjing beans at fourteen dollars forty cents to thirteen dollars sixty-five cents, forty bags of Nanxiang beans at thirteen dollars ninety cents, two hundred and fifty bags of Chongming sand yellow beans at eighteen dollars fifty cents, forty-five bags of Pudong Du beans at sixteen dollars thirty cents.</p>
<p>Bean curds (five days) shipped 465 bags to Hong Kong, 230 bags to Xiamen, crude oil shipped 250 pieces to Hong Kong, and another 500 tins, sesame oil shipped 150 tins to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Fine Cloth, Fine Twill - Spot Weak, Futures High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of cloth piece goods were sluggish, and local merchants' interest was also dull. White goods' selling prices were lower again. Eastern fine cloth fell by two cents to two and a half cents per piece, fine twill fell by one cent to one and a half cents. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth was sold for eighteen dollars, seventy-five cents spot, but the industry's futures prices for the next month remained high. It was heard that Dongmian's price for the next month's Longtou fine cloth was nineteen dollars, forty-five cents per piece, and the price for this month's Laba fine cloth was seventeen dollars, seventy-five cents. Yiteng set the price for this month's Wufu fine cloth at seventeen dollars seventy-five cents, totaling three hundred and several tens of pieces.</p>
<p>In addition, there were ninety-five cases of cloth shipped from Tianjin yesterday. Today, sixteen pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong, and ninety-one pieces are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Wool Prices Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wool trading was brisk, with most well-known brands showing firm gains. Sellers with goods continued to hold back, as the arrival of goods would be difficult in the future, and foreign firms' pricing increased sharply. The 12,000 series tweed, previously priced at four shillings, is now set at four shillings, seven pence. The flannel, previously priced at four shillings and five pence, has risen to five shillings and two pence. On average, the pricing of various European and American wools has increased by one and a half to two points compared to the past, and all their foreign expenses have increased significantly compared to before the European War, plus the payment of tariffs, which invisibly increases by 40%. Therefore, foreign exchange rates must ease to make the price fall for wool.</p>
<h3>Seafood - Pepper Eases</h3>
<p>Black pepper fell to ninety-three dollars in the previous market. The subsequent sales interest remained weak, and inventories were ample. The market is easing. The current market price for black pepper and No. 1 pepper is eighty-eight dollars, five dollars less than before. There have been some recent transactions in white pepper. The high-quality goods are priced at one hundred and forty-eight dollars, and the medium-quality goods are one hundred and forty dollars, a decrease of ten dollars.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Fine Cloth, Fine Twill - Spot Weak, Futures High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign sugar market showed an extremely weak trend as English, American, and Dutch exchange rates continued to lengthen. The association's disk set two and four raw whites which fell two dollars; forty-nine dollars and a half at foreign stores. Turnover was four hundred bags, old goods forty-nine dollars, re-export goods thirty-nine dollars. Turnover was one hundred bags. There were another five hundred bags of road cargo on board on the 7th of this month; forty dollars. Taikoo vehicle white B mark fell by a surprising four dollars compared to the previous day at fifty-three dollars to fifty-three dollars thirty cents, turnover was three hundred bags, the rest of the lower grades and local cotton whites all fell and trading was rare. Domestic sugar was still flat and stable; the Chao gang continued to open high at two hundred bags of Huanggang Qing which sold for thirty-eight dollars, after which the price was small and did not succeed. (The several dozen bags of Shangbaifen opened on the previous day, "dozens" was a mistake and it should be "thousands", this should be corrected)</p>
<p>Price Increase Statistics for August (Continued from November 2nd)</p>
<p>(70) Telegram Fee: Sending to Hong Kong: Ordinary telegrams: 70 cents, Cipher telegrams: 42 cents, Ordinary Chinese clear code telegrams: 35 cents. Sending to Macau: Ordinary telegrams: 85 cents, Cipher telegrams: 51 cents, Ordinary Chinese code telegrams: 42.5 cents.

<h3>North-South Goods - Golden Needles Recover About a Dollar</h3>
<p>Golden needles (dried lily flowers) have recently seen limited arrivals, and as the winter season approaches, most of the arriving goods are dry and can be stored for a long time, so the owners are not in a hurry to sell. The market has seen a turnaround yesterday, and the sales are gradually becoming active, so the market has recovered by about one dollar. High-quality goods are priced at forty dollars, subject to reductions.</p>
<h3>Coal - American Bey Smokeless Coal - Over One Thousand Tons Newly Arrived</h3>
<p>Due to the recent shortage of smokeless coal lump goods, there are many inferior goods from arrival sources, which are not suitable for local retail, so the buying interest is very strong and the market price is tightening. Yesterday, a certain foreign company arrived with more than one thousand tons of American Bei smokeless coal, which was sold to a certain company, and the price was the same as the industry's discount price. Screened lump coal was eighty dollars per ton and mixed coal was seventy-six dollars, transferred and delivered at the pier plus an additional fee of one dollar fifty cents.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Negotiations - No Progress in Recent Days - Behind the Puppet Government, Someone Cannot Be Autonomous - Repeated Surveys of Households Harshly Rejected by Western Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The public notice issued by the Public Works Department on the 2nd, in order to clarify misunderstandings, stated that "the Bureau's submission of proposals to the pseudo-municipal government regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the West District is not to establish a permanent agreement to resolve the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries, but only to discuss some temporary applicable measures to stop friction between the two parties and ensure the maintenance of public order," which proves that the Bureau's compromises aim to resolve all the current disputes, to maintain local peace and tranquility, and not to recognize the pseudo-organization as the legitimate government of China, and to resolve the entire issue of road construction beyond the boundaries with it. When the pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Jun'an accepted the Bureau's proposal, he said that it must be carefully considered. According to diplomatic sources, all the actions and facilities of the pseudo-"Municipal Government" are due to the support and authorization of the Japanese side. Therefore, during the period when the pseudo-party is considering this proposal, the attitude of the Japanese side is extremely important. This is because Fu must consult with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Japanese Manipulation Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Although all parties believe that the future of the negotiations is smooth, it is not optimistic. On the Public Works Bureau side, it focuses on solving the police power issue and is unwilling to give up major rights and interests. This is what the two Public Works Bureau's director general Fan Ke Ling and Fei Li Pu have repeatedly announced to the citizens. If it is impossible to maintain this firm position, to endure the threats of the Japanese and puppet sides, and to continue to make concessions, it will be difficult to obtain the sympathy of Chinese and foreigners and the support of the United States. On the side of the puppet-"Municipal Government", Fu Xiao'an has repeatedly announced his "determination to take back road construction beyond the boundaries," but everything must be according to the Japanese side. Yesterday, two things were noted in the new "Shen Bao" (Shanghai News): (1) The pseudo-"Finance Bureau" is handling household surveys to prepare to collect quarterly housing rents. (2) The pseudo-"Police Bureau" "Shanghai West Branch" will relocate to Difeng Road and will send 3,000 police officers stationed in Shanghai West. The future of the negotiations is not optimistic, and it seems difficult to resolve it in the shortest time.</p>
<p>The Puppet Government Researches the Content</p>
<p>The "Dalu Bao" (The Continent Newspaper) reported that the "proposal" submitted by the Public Works Department to the "Special Municipal Government" on Thursday to temporarily resolve the dispute over road construction beyond the boundaries will not lead to a meeting between representatives of the Public Works Department and the puppet regime until "Mayor" Fu has finished studying its contents and discussing the contents of the "proposal." Fei Li Pu answered reporters yesterday that he did not know when the meeting would be convened. At the same time, according to those close to the "Mayor", this proposal must be considered for a long time, but it was not disclosed when the meeting would be convened.</p>
<p>Household Allocations Were Refused</p>
<p>Recently, the puppet police have repeatedly broken into foreign residences in Shanghai West to investigate household disputes: (1) On the 28th of last month, the puppet police intended to enter a certain American overseas Chinese residence on Lincoln Road but were prohibited by the American overseas Chinese and failed to achieve their goal. (2) On the 1st of this month, two puppet police officers and one Japanese person went to the residence of an American overseas Chinese on the road beyond the boundaries to investigate. The American overseas Chinese sent a letter to the Central United States Evening News and firmly opposed the move. (3) On the 3rd, a puppet police officer attempted to investigate the household of a certain Norwegian resident on the road beyond the boundaries. The homeowner refused, and the puppet police officer even tried to break into the house. The Japanese staff accompanying the puppet police, seeing the situation was not good, dragged the puppet police out. At this time, the Norwegian homeowner took the opportunity to close the door tightly. The puppet police had no other recourse. In addition, the residences of overseas Chinese on the road beyond the boundaries, in the Jiesifeier Road, Kangnaot Road and Kaina Road areas, have been visited by pseudo-police investigators. It is believed that this is a preparation for the pseudo-municipal government to collect taxes.</p>
<p>Tokyo Telecommunications - Cannot Be Confirmed</p>
<p>As for the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries, there is a theory that negotiations are also being conducted in Tokyo at the same time. The cause of this theory is that yesterday's (the 2nd) "Zilin Bao" (North China Daily News) reported that the British Foreign Minister, Butler (mistakenly called the Deputy Secretary of External Affairs, Baituan), answered questions from members of the House of Representatives, stating that the British and American ambassadors to Japan, Klayqi · Geru, had submitted representations to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this matter. The reporter inquired a certain official in the British Embassy in Shanghai yesterday but could not confirm it. Yesterday, the "Zilin Xi Bao" (North China Daily News) reprinted a telecommunications dispatch from a special correspondent in Tokyo, Huo Ding, stating that "the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today (the 3rd) that this matter is currently being discussed by the Shanghai Public Works Department, the Shanghai-Japanese Consul General Miura, and the "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an. It is progressing smoothly, and a satisfactory solution is expected soon." It did not mention any news of negotiations in Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Crabs and Soft-Shelled Turtles Are Also Subject to Control - The Japanese Side's Intensified Efforts</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's strict control of food in Shanghai is meticulous. After establishing a fish market in Yangshupu, all kinds of fish transported to Shanghai were intercepted to the fish market for sale, but crabs and soft-shelled turtles were not included and could still be transported freely to the 16th Pier for sale. However, the Japanese side has recently intensified their efforts to control crabs and soft-shelled turtles transported to Shanghai, and all of them have been intercepted to the fish market for forced purchase. If they are transported directly to the 16th Pier, they will be confiscated once discovered. A large number of general merchants have been confiscated, resulting in huge losses, and they are extremely angry.</p>
<h3>The Premier's Birthday Anniversary - All Circles Prepare to Hang Flags in Accordance with Regulations - Emulating the Premier's Consistent Endeavors</h3>
<p>The 12th of this month is the birthday anniversary of the Kuomintang's late Premier Sun Yat-sen. All circles in this city, because of the extraordinary times and restrictions of the environment, do not intend to hold any celebratory ceremony. However, in order to commemorate the Premier's fearless revolutionary spirit and the great achievements of jointly creating the Republic of China, it was decided to hang flags on that day in accordance with the regulations set by various groups and the two concession authorities to show admiration and mark the anniversary, and to consistently emulate the Premier, encourage efforts and strive for the final victory of the nation.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army Opens and Arrives at Kaibao; Japan Announces the Existence of Hostilities in Four Townships</h3>
<p>In the township of Qibao, west of Shanghai, which is the base of Yao's unit, the ×th battalion directly under the Loyal Salvation Army, several hundred regular soldiers of the ××th division arrived the day before yesterday afternoon. They are commanded by a certain regiment commander named Su and are now stationed in the civilian houses of the four townships, working in full cooperation with Yao's unit to advance to various stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The Japanese troops stationed in Meilong and Xin Zhuang are extremely alarmed. Traffic was cut off at 7 p.m., and pedestrians were forbidden to enter or leave. All businesses also closed early.</p>
<p>Nanhui and Chongming Both See Skirmishes</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", a Japanese army spokesman stated this morning (the 4th) that on October 27th, 300 guerrillas clashed with Japanese troops in the area east of Nanhui, and on October 29th, guerrillas in the vicinity of Xin'an on Chongming Island also fought with Japanese troops, resulting in casualties on both sides.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Forces Set Up Posts to Guard Key Points</p>
<p>The Japanese naval and army headquarters in Hongkou, in order to prevent Chinese guerrilla elements from infiltrating, in addition to implementing emergency precautions by the Japanese army, also ordered the puppet "Police Bureau" and the puppet "Security Team" to increase the number of "officers and police" to, together with the Japanese naval and army units, set up posts in Nanshi, Pudong, Jiangwan, Dachang, Zhenru, Minhang, Yinxiang, and Nanqiao to guard key points. All pedestrians, vehicles, and boats must undergo search procedures before being allowed to pass. Residents in the above-mentioned areas, seeing the sudden increase in tension, are mostly unaware of the true situation and feel uneasy, moving elsewhere to live. Although the puppet "police stations" and puppet township public offices sent out henchmen to stop them from relocating without permission, the trend of moving has not diminished.</p>
<p>Chinese Army in Zha Pu Controls the Qiantang River</p>
<p>The port of Zha Pu in Zhejiang has now been completely recovered by the Chinese army's ××th division and ×＋× independent brigade. All administrative organs of Pinghu County are also located there. It has become a military base controlling both banks of the Qiantang River. According to visitors, a large number of Chinese troops have surrounded Pinghu, and most of the troops have bypassed Pinghu and are heading towards Jiaxing and Xiashi. There will be fighting on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Bullets from outside Pinghu city often enter the city.</p>
<h3>Panamanian Ship Detained; The U.S. Makes No Statement</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the U.S. Consulate in this city, representing the government of Panama, has not yet taken any steps regarding the detention of the Panamanian ship "Bolivar" by the Japanese navy. There is no official news. It was heard from reliable sources last night (the 3rd) that the "Bolivar" has been mortgaged to</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications</p>
<p>It is widely believed that the Japanese navy in Shanghai detained the "Bolivar" because the ship "belonged to" the Bank of Communications under the jurisdiction of the Central Government. It is reported that the "Bolivar" was previously purchased from an American shipping company by a Chinese shipping merchant in this port for US$80,000. When crossing the Pacific Ocean from the east, the ship flew</p>
<p>The Chinese Flag</p>
<p>Near the Chinese coast, it changed to the Panamanian flag. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, it was entrusted to the management of Hualun Shipping Company. However, due to difficulties such as repair costs exceeding 60,000 yuan, the ship owner resold it through Hualun Shipping Company to a certain group in Hong Kong two weeks ago for £21,000. At that time, the ship was flying</p>
<p>The Norwegian Flag</p>
<p>Although the original purchaser had resold it, the loss was quite large. It is reported that when the ship was purchased in the United States, the Bank of Communications made the payment, and the Bank of Communications now holds the mortgage right of the ship. It is understood that the "Bolivar" was detained by the Japanese navy at the beginning of this week, and some Chinese crew members were arrested. The U.S. Consulate in this city has not made any explanation regarding this matter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Catholic Church Buildings in Nanchuan; French Priest Father Danon Injured; Japanese Army Drops Heavy Bombs</h3>
<p>Nanchuan Has No Military Installations</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", Nanchuan, a small city in Sichuan Province near the Guizhou border, was attacked by Japanese planes on October 13th. French priest Father Danon was among those injured. The Catholic property that was destroyed included the bell tower, the church, Father Danon's residence, the girls' department of the Catholic primary school, and the home for the elderly, weak, and disabled. Of the 34 churches in the Chongqing Catholic Diocese, the church destroyed in Nanchuan was the most exquisite. According to Catholic leaders in this port, the construction of the church cost more than</p>
<p>Five Hundred Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Father Danon suffered injuries to his left leg and face and is currently being treated at a Catholic hospital in Chongqing. According to doctors, Father Danon will need more than a month to recover. The bombing by Japanese planes occurred as follows: At 10:30 a.m. on October 13th, an initial air raid alert was issued in Nanchuan. Ten minutes later, an emergency alert was issued. Within five minutes,</p>
<p>Japanese Bombers</p>
<p>Eighteen planes, divided into two groups, attacked. Nine of them continued flying forward, while the other nine dropped bombs on Nanchuan. When Father Danon ran out of the church, one bomb hit the bell tower 20 feet away, and another hit the church. Father Danon's left leg was struck by shrapnel. A Chinese priest helped him to walk painfully for 100 feet, and then another bomb was dropped. Both were injured, and Father Danon was</p>
<p>Injured in the Face</p>
<p>Japanese planes dropped more than 60 demolition and incendiary bombs weighing from 200 to 800 pounds each in Nanchuan and its suburbs. Fires broke out in the city and were not extinguished until dawn. Of the 20,000 people in Nanchuan, at least 200 were killed, and the number of injured is unknown. Nearly two-thirds of the houses were destroyed. In addition to Father Danon and the Chinese priest, there were four other church personnel</p>
<p>Four People Injured</p>
<p>The wife of a Chinese doctor at the church was burned to death. According to Father Danon, Nanchuan has no military installations, and the Catholic Church buildings, with three floors, are taller than all other buildings in the city. When the Japanese planes attacked, they flew very low, and the church buildings were easily identifiable.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes; Issuance Date Determined; Still Adopting a Gradual Issuance System; Registration for Various Industries to Receive Notes Has Been Processed</h3>
<p>New Dime Notes Will Be Redeemed Upon Arrival</p>
<p>The Central Bank issued 500,000 yuan of one-fen and five-fen fractional currency notes in the first batch, which has already been fully issued. The second batch of 500,000 yuan has been rushed to print by the American Yongning Company and is scheduled to be delivered in batches from the 15th of this month. Now, the Shanghai branch of the bank has decided to gradually issue them in batches from that date. In order to avoid them flowing into the occupied areas, the method of entrusting various industry associations to distribute them has been adopted. Various industry associations have already processed the registration of members' needs for fractional currency notes. In the future, they will receive the total amount registered from the Central Bank and then distribute them to their members for use. As for the one-jiao and two-jiao subsidiary currency notes, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has now completed the issuance. After the new subsidiary currency notes arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong, the issuance will continue. However, the issuance method after this stipulates that each person may not exceed a certain amount, in order to restrict it.</p>

<h3>Language Exhibition; More Treasures Continue to Be Displayed; Guests Shoulder to Shoulder, Heel to Toe, Reaching a Grand Climax; Preferential Methods Ordered for Students to Visit</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Language Exhibition, various circles have continuously sent valuable treasures for display, so the content of the exhibition is becoming more and more substantial. Chinese and foreign visitors have been shoulder to shoulder, heel to toe, crowded and unbearable. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Various Circles Assist; Continuing to Send Exhibits</p>
<p>Various circles believe that the Language Exhibition is rarely held in countries around the world and is of great significance, so they unanimously assist. Yesterday, various circles again sent treasures and valuable items for display, including the Nestorian Stele from the YMCA, the Egyptian Beetle Seal from Yin Chen, the Tang Dynasty Dali porcelain epitaph from Gu Ao, the Leifeng Pagoda Buddhist scriptures from Gu Zhongfu, the 300-year-old Yunnan Miao script from American Ms. Granke, "Survey of Chinese Art" by Ferguson, "Catalog of Recorded Paintings of Past Dynasties", "Records of Past Dynasties", "Records of Auspicious Bronzes", etc. The content of the exhibition is becoming more and more substantial.</p>
<p>Holding Performances; Publishing Monographs</p>
<p>In addition to the performances by blind and deaf children that have already been held, a telecommunications performance and a dialect performance were held yesterday. The association has also hired dialect experts Zhao Jingshen, Zhou Jiaoqing, Yan Gongshang, and others to take turns giving performances of more than 40 kinds of dialects at the association at 10:00 a.m. every day. The location for the association's lectures is currently being negotiated with the Sichuan Road YMCA. In addition, in order to promote language education, the association has specially commissioned experts to write special articles on language, which will be printed and sold. Yesterday, Chen Wangdao's "The Evolution of Chinese Phonetic Writing" and Zhang Shilu's "Phonetic Writing After the Development of Language in the Ming Dynasty" began to be sold, and Zhang Feng, a famous scholar of oracle bone inscriptions, is about to publish "The Evolution and Understanding of Chinese Language from Ancient Times to the Six Dynasties", which is an excellent reference for studying Chinese language.</p>
<p>Visitors Show Great Interest</p>
<p>Because the Language Exhibition is a rare opportunity, all circles are eager to be the first to see it. Yesterday, more than 2,000 people from all walks of life went to visit, and there were also several hundred foreigners and Japanese. Therefore, they were shoulder to shoulder, heel to toe, crowded and unbearable, which shows the importance that people in society attach to the association. Among those who visited yesterday, such as Ferguson and other foreigners, all held microscopes to study Chinese oracle bone inscriptions, while students all held paper and pens, copying ancient coins and oracle bones, showing great interest. The association has now specially formulated preferential ticket methods in order to give preferential treatment to student groups: (1) Student groups holding letters of certification from the school authorities receive a 50% discount; (2) From Monday to Friday, school groups visiting with hundreds of people and led by teachers receive an 80% discount in addition to the 50% discount, so that all students in the city have the opportunity to visit.</p>
<h3>Roaming the Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>Humans obtain the instinct for language, grasp the tools of writing, and thus conquer the world. China established itself as a nation the earliest, with vast territory, and the evolution of language is complex and intricate. In the current process of resistance and reconstruction, when education urgently needs to be popularized, there should be an early review. The opening of the Language Exhibition at this time and in this place is truly a cultural event worthy of attention on this isolated island. A special correspondent from the Dazhong News Agency went to the association yesterday and inspected the exhibition hall in the historical order of its layout. The first thing that caught the eye were the tortoise shells and animal bones, Shang tripods and Zhou bells, which are the oldest extant Chinese characters. Turning into the second room, steles and old rubbings, knives, cloth, and coins were dazzlingly displayed, creating a grand spectacle. Old Song and Yuan prints were displayed on the walls, and a map of Chinese language areas was also there. The third room shows the types of languages and the confluence of cultures. More than 600 kinds of Bibles in various languages, the Chinese translation of the Five Classics in French from the Xuhui Library, and the Sanskrit palm-leaf scriptures are all enlightening and broaden one's knowledge, awakening people to deep thought. Those who study Chinese language must regard Xu Shen's "Shuowen Jiezi" as a guide. The fourth room displays hundreds of books exploring Xu's book, ancient and modern. Its most recent great achievement, Mr. Ma Xulun's manuscript of "Annotation on the Six Scripts", is also on display. The fifth room is for blind children to learn to read, the Latinization of Chinese characters, and the dialect performance area. From this, we know that what human power can achieve is ingenious, and new paths can be sought through comparative research. The sixth room is the special room for Ji Juemi's treasures. The silver pagoda, with hanging whiskers, solemnly placed in a glass box, is the pagoda brush. Ji's handwritten "Thousand Character Classic" in a hundred styles, the Zhang Da Jianfang's character "Tao", and Ai Liyuan's translation of the Quran are all known for their rarity. Traversing the past and present, the origins and evolution come to a conclusion. Entering the seventh room, one reaches the stage of exploring the trends of Chinese language. On the wall is a "Chart of the Changing Trends of the National Language over Four Thousand Years", which traces the past in detail and reveals the future. Thus, research works and historical materials on the reform of language are widely listed. There are 89 kinds of books and newspapers on the Latinization of Chinese characters, covering almost all theories, plans, and textbooks. Leaving the exhibition hall, those who watch this exhibition not only broaden their knowledge and see the world, but also know the era mission that we should bear in promoting Chinese language.</p>
<h3>Puyi Handicraft Workshop Solicits Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>The Puyi Handicraft Workshop, sponsored by the Puyi Society of the Shanghai Christian Church, has been supported by the American Presbyterian Church, the International Red Cross, and various Chinese and Western charities, and has spared no effort in engaging in disaster relief work in the refugee area of Nanshi. In addition to setting up a refugee workshop, it also holds various relief undertakings such as clinics and refugee children's schools. It has been operating for two years and has achieved remarkable results, which has been praised by various circles in China and abroad. Now, the society is calling on all sectors of society to solicit old winter clothing for the benefit of the refugees in the area, as the winter season is approaching and the tens of thousands of victims in the Nanshi area will face severe oppression. In recent days, a large number of people from all walks of life have donated winter clothing. The general affairs office of the society is located at Room 308, 113 Jiujiang Road, and the winter clothing collection point is located at Room 202, 115 Hankou Road, telephone number 16082.</p>
<h3>British Aviation Association Fetes British and American Officials</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hulton, Commander-in-Chief of the British Yangtze River Fleet in China, and Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the American Yangtze River Patrol, at the invitation of the British Royal Aeronautical Society, went to the HSBC Building on the afternoon of the 3rd to have a meal. In addition to Chairman Sassoon giving a welcome speech, the two British and American commanders both gave short speeches. Major Neville was also present to accompany them. On the 2nd of this month, the British Royal Association hosted a banquet for Xiao Tuo, a senior officer of the British Army's East Surrey Regiment stationed in Shanghai, and 25 others, to celebrate. It is understood that the British Royal Aviation Association has been very active in the liaison between the British, American, naval, and army forces in Shanghai since the outbreak of the European War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Withdraw from North of Suzhou Creek; American Army Barracks Move West; Situation on North Jiangxi Road Not Relaxed; American Troops Defend South Bank of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Several days ago, there were several armed Japanese soldiers patrolling back and forth inside and outside the barbed wire fence of the Japanese defense zone in District A, north of Suzhou Creek, paying attention to pedestrians and prohibiting the transmission of objects across the barbed wire fence, and driving away poor women and children who were scavenging. Yesterday, the Japanese soldiers had already withdrawn. However, there are still Japanese soldiers guarding the two gaps at Haining Road and Wenshi Road, checking pedestrians coming and going.</p>
<p>Tense Atmosphere Still Not Relieved</p>
<p>Since the Japanese guards at the barbed wire fence gaps on the east side of North Jiangxi Road suddenly imposed strict checks on residents entering and leaving, this tense atmosphere has not been relieved. According to a Datong News Agency reporter who rushed to the area last night to inspect, residents entering and leaving the two gaps at Haining Road and Wenshi Road must not only show their passes, but also undergo strict checks. Those carrying heavy objects are refused entry inside the barbed wire fence. Sometimes, Japanese sentries leave their posts and roam in the middle of North Jiangxi Road, attracting more attention. Although Japanese troops frequently patrol from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, there are no other restrictions, so residents do not have any inconvenience.</p>
<p>City Housing Iron Doors All Removed</p>
<p>In the area north of the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu, except for a part of the city's houses that have been repaired by workers hired by the Japanese army, the iron gates and windows of more than ten places such as the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the National Medical College have all been removed by the Japanese army. However, the barbed wire fence is still blocking and has not changed. According to residents there, the iron gates, windows, and metal objects in the houses were removed by the Japanese army and transported away by cars. It is thought that they were collecting metal products to transport back to Japan to manufacture military equipment.</p>
<p>American Defense Forces Stationed in Four Locations</p>
<p>The American defense forces stationed in Shanghai have moved their Chengdu Road camp west and stationed in several locations, making the defense more thorough and the public order very good. The military is stationed at the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinzha Road, the intersection of Gordon Road and Binglang Road, the intersection of Xinzha Road and Seymour Road, and Xiaoshadu Road. There are often rotating American soldiers guarding in front of each camp, with strict discipline and hard work. Since the Shanghai War, there have been very few incidents in the area defended by the military, which is commendable. At present, there are important areas such as the Mint Bridge at the end of Xiaoshadu Road, the end of Yichang Road, the end of Macau Road, the end of Robison Road, Binglang Road, Masaki Road, Macdonnell Road, Sanban Factory New Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, and Wuzhen Road Bridge, with two to three or three to four American soldiers stationed there, paying particular attention to pedestrians coming and going, and dispatching large numbers of American soldiers to patrol the border at night when necessary.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Bound Ships from Hong Kong and Fujian Ports Cancel Quarantine; Cholera Near Extinction; Fewer Cases This Year</h3>
<p>The cholera epidemic in this port is now nearing extinction, so ports such as Hong Kong and Fuzhou have cancelled quarantine restrictions on ships sailing from Shanghai. Regarding the general situation of cholera in this port this year, the Public Works Department reports that the number of people suffering from cholera in this port so far is small. It is difficult to say whether part of it is due to top-up injections. What is undoubtedly true is that the late discovery of the disease is not the only factor in the small number of patients. This can be seen clearly from the situation in 1937. Cholera epidemics seem to have a certain rotation, as mentioned in this office in 1930, and after a severe epidemic, it is rare to see a prevalence the following year. If we can accurately investigate the various reasons for cholera outbreaks in other regions on an annual rotation basis for comparison, the work of prevention can be greatly simplified. Now that there is no way to investigate, it is difficult to determine the results of the top-up methods used.</p>
<h3>British Ship Sunk by Submarine; Adventures of the MacDonalds; "Athenia" First Hit by a Torpedo; Mr. MacDonald Arrives in Shanghai to Describe the Adventure</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, after the outbreak of the European War, the British ship "Athenia" was the first to be sunk by a submarine launching a torpedo. Hundreds of passengers escaped. Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald, shipping supervisors of the Marler Company in this port, were also among them. Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd) on the wartime gray-painted "Empress of Asia". The reporter met Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald in the passenger boat of the ship. The details of the adventure are as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Shock</p>
<p>On the evening of September 3rd, the sky was dark. Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald and others were sailing on the "Athenia" 250 miles west of Scotland when they were suddenly hit by an explosion. The explosion seemed to be near the rear engine room and the third class cabin in the middle of the ship. Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald were looking around on the deck, and more and more passengers ran from the cabins to the handrails of the ship.</p>
<p>Asking About What Happened</p>
<p>The lights in the ship went out due to the first shock, and the crowd asked each other what had happened. Someone said it was a submarine. Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald both saw a submarine a few hundred yards away, barely discernible in the haze. Judging from its appearance, the submarine seemed to have been moored there for a long time. After a while, the submarine fired a shot, which did not hit, but exploded in the air above the ship. Passengers poured out of the cabin doors and climbed the stairs to the deck. At that time, there was almost no crowding or shouting on the ship. The crew did a good job of handling the emergency.</p>
<p>Sixty People Died</p>
<p>The lifeboats on the ship were all placed on the sea. Sixty people who were in the third class cabin when the torpedo hit died. The rest all entered the lifeboats to escape. Occasionally, children were separated from their parents and were dragged along by other passengers, which disrupted the orderly order. Before long, the lifeboats were ordered to leave.</p>
<p>Drifting with the Waves</p>
<p>The small boat that Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald were on carried 50 people and was very crowded. In the haze, they could still see most of the "Athenia" floating on the sea. After a while, dusk fell and the ship was no longer visible. The submarine had also disappeared. The lifeboats drifted with the waves. At midnight, the lights of a ship appeared. The ship was the Norwegian ship "Knarrens".</p>
<p>One Boat Capsized</p>
<p>However, the boat that Mr. MacDonald and others were on was too far away. In the huge waves, it was not easy for the crew to maneuver. Later, it was learned that the propellers of the "Knarrens" broke a lifeboat in the dark. The wife and three children of a Polish passenger in the boat that Mr. MacDonald and others were on were in that boat, and they and 40 other passengers were drowned.</p>
<p>More Severe Disaster</p>
<p>By dawn, the rescue ship towed the small boats to the side of the ship. Mr. and Mrs. MacDonald and others were rescued by a British destroyer and taken to Greenock, Scotland. After waiting for two weeks, they took the American "Banker" back across the Atlantic. The last impression they had of the "Athenia" was that the ship was tilting badly, waiting to be hit so that it would eventually sink to the bottom of the sea, so as not to float on the sea and cause obstruction.</p>

<h3>The Shen Yuanlai Tung Oil Shop Robbery Case; Two Men and One Woman Captured; Twenty-Six Large Box Cannon Bullets Seized; Confessed to Being Members of the "Self-Defense Corps" and Ordered to Commit Robbery; More Than Ten Thousand Yuan Robbed; Awaiting Arrest of Accomplices for Further Verification</h3>
<p>The Shen Yuanlai Tung Oil Shop, located at No. 243 Guangdong Road, is opened by Sheng Xiqi. At about 6:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, suddenly eight robbers came, seven of whom broke into the shop to rob, and one was guarding the entrance of Yongningli at the back door of the shop. At that time, the robbers used intimidation to force the shop assistants to hand over the keys to the silver box, and then robbed the 10,400 yuan of legal tender stored inside. At that time, Zhou Asi, a Huai'an man who was the Secretary-Guard, No. 552, Yongningli, heard that the Shen Yuanlai Shop had robbers and intended to go to arrest them. Just as he stepped forward to ask, the</p>
<p>Robber Guarding the Entrance</p>
<p>Suddenly pulled out a gun and fired a shot at the guard, hitting the guard's right arm and penetrating the right chest. He fell to the ground injured. Seeing that the disaster had already been caused and that the goal had been achieved, the remaining robbers fled in two directions, one towards Jinlong Street and the other towards Edward Road to the west. At that time, Xu Fusheng, a shop assistant of Shen Yuanlai Shop, followed the robbers who fled from Edward Road. When passing the intersection of Edward Road and Fujian Road, it happened that Guo Ruiquan, a Chinese detective of the Old Gate Police Station, was leading Chinese and Western detectives on the road to search pedestrians. Xu immediately reported to Detective Guo that the</p>
<p>Two Men and One Woman</p>
<p>Were members of the robbery gang. Detective Guo and others immediately went forward to arrest the three. A large car box cannon was seized from the side of one of the men, with twenty-six bullets inside. They were taken back to the police station. After interrogation, it was learned that the three were named Xu Yanghe (the one with the gun), Guo Wanjin, and Dai Xiuying, all from Yangzhou. After investigation, it was learned that Xu and others were members of the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" in western Shanghai and were ordered by a team leader named Hou to go there. A total of seven men and one woman went, and four of them had weapons. They were immediately taken into custody. The guard Zhou Asi's gunshot wound has not yet been removed, so his life is in danger and cannot be predicted. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Xu and the other three to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested permission to</p>
<p>Temporarily Detain</p>
<p>The case, as the police station was inspecting the seized firearms and investigating the accomplices. He also submitted the fingerprints of Xu and Guo to the court. Xu and Guo had previously been sentenced to three years and six months in prison by the court for robbery cases. When questioned, the two defendants, Xu and Guo, confessed to the robbery, while Dai Xiuying claimed that although she went with Xu and others, she did not know that it was a robbery, because Xu invited her to go out to buy cloth. After Magistrate Xiao Xieye reviewed the confession, he ordered all the defendants to be remanded in custody for another week.</p>
<h3>House Burnt Down, Lawsuit for Compensation</h3>
<p>Liang Yousan, the former director of the inquiry office at Hangzhou Station, originally residing at No. 152, Lower Sheep Market, Hangzhou, insured his residence and furniture for 1,500 yuan with the fire insurance department of the Central Trust Bureau on Albert Road in the French Concession two years ago on August 5th. Last year in February, his residence was burnt down in a fire, and all the furniture was destroyed. Recently, he engaged a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Civil Division, accusing the insurance department of the Central Trust Bureau and requesting a judgment ordering them to compensate 1,500 yuan in national currency. The case was taken up by Judge Yu Changzi and heard in Civil Chamber Seven. The defendant, the Central Trust Bureau, appointed lawyer Liu Shifang to appear in court, stating that the plaintiff's residence was set on fire by Japanese troops, and the defendant had witnesses to prove this. According to the law, the defendant was not liable for compensation. Subsequently, Chen Ziqing, the head of the baojia (local security system) residing at No. 150, Lower Sheep Market, Hangzhou, testified that the plaintiff's house was indeed destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. However, the plaintiff, Liang Yousan, insisted that it was due to a neighbor's negligence. After the court debate, the judge announced the closure of the hearing and that a judgment would be made at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chen Adong Kidnapping Case: Key Suspect Arrested, Hostage Still Missing</h3>
<p>Chen Adong, a local gardener who lives at Chen Li's residence at the intersection of Haig Road and Route Say Zoong in the French Concession, was kidnapped on September 28th around 8:00 AM. While planting trees in the Linjia Lane garden on Zhongshan Road in Hongqiao, a dozen or so kidnappers suddenly appeared and abducted Chen. The kidnappers demanded 200,000 yuan for his release. Despite the family's efforts to rescue him, he has not yet been freed. It has now come to light that the French police have arrested a key suspect in the case, rumored to be a relative of the victim. He is currently under close investigation. However, the hostage's whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Flower Gambling Den Madam Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>The woman Zhou Zhangshi, a native of Zhenjiang, is 40 years old this year. She lives at No. 24, Yuehua Fang, Qianjiatang, Avenue Joffre. Her actions bear a resemblance to those of the former flower gambling queen, Lao Qi Lu. Recently, acting on the instructions of flower gambling kingpins Mao Axiang, Li Xiaobao, and Qian Zongfan, she opened a flower gambling "listening tube" (a place where gambling bets were placed) in Qianjiatang, victimizing countless foolish men and women. She was recently arrested by the French Concession police and brought before the Eighth Criminal Chamber of the Second Special Court for prosecution. The court sentenced Zhou Zhangshi to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Lumber Company Sued for Public Fees: Retrial Overturns Original Judgment, French Lawyer Tascom Loses Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The five lumber companies, Yankang, Zhenchang, Changyuan, Kaitai, etc., located in the Nanshi area, relocated to vacant land in the area of Route Say Zoong and Rue Pere Huc in the western district of the French Concession during the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th when Nanshi fell. Later, because the French Municipal Council stipulated that only buildings could be constructed on the vacant land in that area, and lumber companies could not be established to store timber, the Municipal Council informed the lumber companies to relocate within a time limit. Subsequently, the persons in charge of each lumber company jointly appointed French lawyer Tascom (phonetic transliteration) to represent them and request the French Municipal Council to exempt them from relocation. At that time, they jointly signed a commission contract, stipulating a public fee of 300 yuan. Subsequently, lawyer Tascom made a request to the French Municipal Council for exemption from relocation, but it was not approved. The lumber companies had no choice but to relocate within the prescribed time limit, and handed over the public fee of 300 yuan to lawyer Tascom, and retrieved the commission contract (the original contract did not specify the amount of the public fee), and Tascom issued a receipt for the 300 yuan public fee, as a final settlement. Unexpectedly, in July of this year, lawyer Tascom filed a lawsuit with the Civil Chamber of the Second Special Court against the four lumber companies, Yankang, Zhenchang, Changyuan, and Kaitai,</p>
<p>claiming public fees</p>
<p>of 1,200 yuan, arguing that at that time, it was stipulated that each company's public fee was 300 yuan, and for five companies, it totaled 1,500 yuan. In addition to the 300 yuan received, 1,200 yuan was still owed, and he requested a judgment ordering the four defendants to jointly pay. He also stated that the whereabouts of the defendants were unknown, and requested public notification. The court, at the plaintiff's request, made a public announcement. When the defendants failed to appear, a default judgment was made, ordering the four defendants to jointly repay the public fee of 1,200 yuan and bear the litigation costs. After the judgment was finalized, it was transferred to the execution chamber</p>
<p>for enforcement. Only then did the four lumber companies learn that they had been sued for owing public fees. Surprised, the persons in charge of the aforementioned four lumber companies, Zhang Yongde, Ma Chunrong, Zhang Chunbao, and Zhang Shiyi, appointed lawyer Wu Luping et al. to file a retrial with the Civil Chamber of the First Special Court against lawyer Tascom, requesting that the original judgment be overturned and a fair judgment be rendered, and that the retrial defendant bear the costs of both trials. A few days ago, Judge Li Liang summoned both parties</p>
<p>to the court for retrial. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff presented evidence such as the recovered commission contract, the receipt for the public fee, and the accurate addresses of the plaintiffs. Lawyer Yamakawa Yoshio defended on behalf of the defendant. The court announced the closure of the debate and scheduled a date for judgment. These details have already been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, the judgment for this case was delivered by Judge Yu Changzi in the Seventh Tribunal. The main text stated: "The original judgment is overturned, and the retrial defendant's claim is dismissed. The litigation costs shall be borne by the retrial defendant."</p>
<h3>Opium Use Leads to Punishment</h3>
<p>Zhao Huiguo, a Ningbo native in his late fifties and an employee of the Lu Xin Tobacco and Leather Company, was arrested by the French police for opium use. Yesterday, he was brought before the First Criminal Chamber of the Second Special Court for prosecution. The court sentenced Zhao Huiguo to four months of imprisonment for opium use, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Major Robbery of Jiuru Money Exchange: More Gang Members Apprehended, Eighteen Men and Women Detained for Interrogation, Many Suspects Released Due to Lack of Involvement</h3>
<p>On the 12th of last month, at 8:15 AM, the Jiuru Money Exchange at No. 84, Seward Road, Yangshupu, was stormed by a large group of armed robbers. They pulled out pistols, preventing the exchange employees from raising the alarm. They used hemp ropes to tie them up and forced the accountant to hand over the keys to the iron safe hidden in the cellar of the exchange. They stole national currency, Japanese currency, and British gold worth 135,846.9 yuan, as well as gold watches and gold rings belonging to the staff, and fled in separate directions. Recently, Chinese detectives Zhou Guisen and Zhang Yunsheng of the Hongkew Police Station</p>
<p>arrested five suspects including Chen Youqi, and confiscated赃物 法币美金日元票等共计二万四千餘允, sending them to the First Special District Court for detention. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. The leader and many accomplices are still being investigated. At 3:50 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Shang Wu of the Hongkew Police Station learned that members of the robbery gang were hiding in Room 337 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. He then, together with detectives Ma Bingzhang and Wang Youshan, and Western detective Hurnell and detective Pei Wen,</p>
<p>carrying weapons</p>
<p>rushed to the hotel. Without making a sound, they arrested eleven people from Pudong: Dai Gengsheng, Zhang Pinru, Xu Jinshan, Hu Zhenxiang, Zhang Zhongliang; locals: Zhu Tingtao, Lu Jinkui, Shen Jisheng; a Danyang native: Shu Mingxi; a Suzhou native: Wang Guilin; and a Liuhe native: Zhu Xuexi. It is understood that there are still accomplices hiding at No. 81 of the Southeast Hotel at No. 12, West Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, and at No. 19, Lane 233, Route de Say Zoong. The Chinese and Western detectives again went to those addresses and apprehended six more people: Pudong natives Sun Hongsheng; Chongming natives Wang Ziqing, Wu Pengcheng, Shen Bailing; and women Shi Qizhen, Lu Wanzhen, and Xu Wuda.

<p>confiscated stolen goods</p>
<p>Including national currency bank deposits and gold pounds worth over 20,000 yuan, they were all brought back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were brought before the Third Criminal Tribunal. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, and stated that a total of more than 40 robbers and suspects had been arrested in the case. Those who were found to be uninvolved after police investigation and interrogation had been released.

<h3>Lost Children's Sad Stories: Three Lost Children Awaiting Relatives to Claim Them</h3>
<p>Boy Ye Yifang</p>
<p>Nine years old, from Haimen, went missing on Nanjing Road on October 29th. He was sent to the Gongbeiju Children's Protection Section by the Laozha Police Station. According to the child himself, his father's name is Ye Laiying, but he does not know where he currently lives. After his mother died, his father remarried and abandoned his son from his previous marriage. After that, Yifang had to live with his older sister, Hai Feng, on Xuzhen Road in Xujiahui. On October 23rd, his sister asked a friend's son (16 years old) to take Yifang to see a movie at the Golden Theatre in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, he got separated from his companion when leaving the theatre and was stranded on the street. Staff from the Children's Protection Section led Yifang to Xuzhen Road to find his sister, but with no result, because the child could not specify the location. The child is now being sheltered by the Children's Home of the Catholic Infant Rescue Association. It is hoped that the child's sister will come to claim him. If the child's father, Ye Laiying, can care for his son from his previous marriage and come to claim him, it would be a great blessing for the child.</p>
<p>Boy Guo Amao</p>
<p>Eleven years old, from Ningbo, went missing at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road on October 27th. He was sent to the Gongbeiju Children's Protection Section by the Chengdu Road Police Station. According to the child himself, his home is in Ningbo. His sister's husband works in Shanghai and lives near the racecourse. Nine months ago, he came to Shanghai with his mother to visit because his sister was giving birth. He lived in his sister's husband's house. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, he was ordered by his mother to go out shopping and forgot the way back, ending up stranded on the street and begging for food. Staff from the Children's Protection Section led the child to the racecourse area to look for his sister's husband's address, but with no result. The child is now being sheltered by the Children's Home of the Catholic Infant Rescue Association. It is hoped that his mother and sister's husband will come to complete the procedures for claiming him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Girl Shi Maotou</p>
<p>Nine years old, from Wuxi, went missing at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road on October 25th. She was sent to the Gongbeiju Children's Protection Section by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The child is covered in scabies. Because she is young, she cannot provide much information. It is only known that the girl was given to someone else by her parents several years ago and brought to live in Shanghai. The Children's Protection Section sent the child to the children's hospital for treatment, and she has recovered. She is now being sheltered by the Children's Home of the Catholic Infant Rescue Association. It is hoped that people related to the child can come and report information, so that the Protection Section or the Catholic Infant Rescue Association can know exactly how to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Post Office Limits Female Employees: Further Efforts to Argue, Establishes Negotiation Committee, Cables Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Preside</h3>
<p>The women's community in this city, regarding the Yunnan Post Office's announcement of measures to limit the employment of female employees, gathered again to discuss the matter yesterday, and established a negotiation committee, jointly issuing two telegrams to the Ministry of Communications and Madame Chiang Kai-shek, requesting the ministry to instruct the Post Office to abolish it by a certain date, and requesting Madame Chiang Kai-shek to uphold justice and urge the postal authorities to quickly abolish the unequal treatment measures.</p>
<p>Lawyer Qian Jianqiu's Opinion</p>
<p>Regarding the Post Office's restriction on female employees, Dr. Qian Jianqiu, a female lawyer in this city, issued the following statement: "I cannot help but consider the authorities' measures to be inappropriate in regard to the Post Office's decision to restrict the employment of female employees. Since women have equal opportunities for education, their responsibilities to society and the family are no less than those of men, and their intellectual abilities are no less than those of men. Even from a legal point of view, as the fundamental law of the country, the Constitution, has adopted the principle of gender equality, and the part of the Civil Code concerning kinship and inheritance, the rights of women are stipulated to be equal to those of men, and the obligations of women are also stipulated to be equal to those of men. Therefore, women in society and in law should not be discriminated against compared to men. The Post Office, as an important transportation agency of the government, should not stipulate regulations that are not in accordance with national laws.</p>
<p>Contradicts National Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>The measure restricting the employment of female employees can be said to contradict national laws and regulations. As for whether women are suitable for dispatching and whether they can handle some of the postal work such as parcel transportation, this is a question of women's own physical strength and willingness to undertake it, and should not be restricted by the bureau. The measures formulated by the Post Office have dealt a serious blow to women's career prospects. Therefore, I hope that the women's community and all sectors of society will pay attention to it and work together to fight for it."</p>
<h3>A Man Was Stabbed</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 2:50 PM, Hong Yuanhao (34 years old), a resident of No. 560, Datong Road, Public Concession, was at home when a man suddenly broke in, pulled out a sharp blade, and stabbed Hong fiercely. Hong dodged to avoid it, and was stabbed in the anus. Blood flowed like a torrent, and he fell to the ground in pain. The assailant, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, immediately fled. Afterwards, his roommate reported to the nearby police officer, who sent Hong to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Tongren Hospital Urges the Girl's Claim</h3>
<p>Tongren Hospital at No. 37, Avenue Dubail in this city, received a sick child, Zhou Jinmei (female), six years old, from the Second International Refugee Children's Shelter on May 24 of this year. She was immediately given treatment. Because the symptoms were quite serious, she has only now recovered. According to the original report from the refugee shelter, the address left by the girl's parents was No. 19, Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, but no one has come to visit throughout the girl's treatment period. After investigation by the hospital, there is also no Zhou family at No. 19, Baxianfang. The hospital sincerely hopes that the girl's parents can come to claim her recently. If they still indicate abandonment, the hospital authorities will have full authority to arrange for the girl's care, and she will be cut off from her parents from now on.</p>

<h3>"Work When You Work, Play When You Play"</h3>
<p>— By a Solitary Person</p>
<p>Dear children! Have you ever heard this saying: "Work when you work, play when you play"? — This is a very common British saying. Teachers in schools and parents at home often use this sentence to teach their students and children. Here, let me talk about this issue with everyone:</p>
<p>When we do anything, we must be focused and put all our energy into the work we are doing. Only in this way can we have good results and achievements. Why is that? Let me give an example to illustrate. For example, today your teacher at school gave you ten arithmetic problems to solve at home. Well then, children, after you get home, the first thing you must do is to work on it. When you are working on it, you must use your brainpower and concentrate on finding the answer. You must not shift your attention to playing ball or going to the park. As the saying goes, "You can't do two things at once," that's the idea! Because when you are working, you only need to concentrate until the work is finished, then you will get good results. Conversely, if you are thinking about how to trick your parents into going out and playing ball with the neighbor's children, or planning to go to the store to buy candy while you are working. As a result, not only will you not do your arithmetic well, but you might even calculate three plus five as seven!</p>
<p>Now that we understand that when we work, we must concentrate on our work and not interject thoughts of play, let's explain the phrase "play when you play":</p>
<p>This is the same principle as above! Often when you get home from school, you rush to throw your schoolbag in a corner and run to your classmates to play marbles or hide-and-seek. At first, perhaps you feel quite happy because you have just been sitting quietly in school for several hours. However, you often remember that you have to memorize Chinese or take a general knowledge test tomorrow, and you have not prepared sufficiently, so you unconsciously pull your thoughts back to your books. At that time, although you are playing marbles on the one hand, you are worrying about tomorrow's homework on the other, so you end up not enjoying the game.</p>
<p>So we must play after we have finished working. In this way, not only will our work have good results, but we will also find the game interesting.</p>
<p>Children! Please remember!</p>
<h3>Natural Autumn Talk: Crabs and Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— By Lu Lishi</p>
<p>The natural world in autumn seems as desolate and calm as the weather, but fortunately, crabs and chrysanthemums come out to support this biological scene that is known for being lively. Now, I will talk about crabs and chrysanthemums, as my autumn gift to the children of this publication.</p>
<p>Crabs are often called "Lord Intestineless" in ancient books, perhaps because ancient people could not pick out the intestines and stomachs when eating crabs. Because its body is flat and round, and its four legs on both sides are sharp and it walks sideways. In the water, when it encounters animals smaller than itself, it uses its pincers to hold them tight and does not let go, it is extraordinarily vicious, so humans have given it another name: "General Sideways."</p>
<p>There are two types of crabs, male and female. The male's abdomen has a pointed navel, and the female's abdomen has a round navel. Those who catch crabs go to the river bank or the place where crabs spawn, and light a fire. Strangely enough, the crabs will gather around when they see the fire. The fishermen catch them all at once and return full of load, selling them to others.</p>
<p>"Holding crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums" is a refined event that Chinese literati pass down in autumn. Buying a few dollars' worth of crabs, and in a garden with chrysanthemums in full bloom, a few friends drinking wine and looking at chrysanthemums, talking and laughing, is truly a joy in life!</p>
<p>Crabs will be caught and cooked to eat, which they themselves may not believe. In the water, everyone is afraid of it, so it specializes in bullying the weak and acting lawlessly. Who knows, although it is strong in the water, when it falls into human hands, it cannot avoid falling into the pot, its shell changes from green to red, and nothing works anymore. From this point of view, we can know that if we only emphasize violence and do not seek justice, the result will be failure.</p>
<p>Between August and September, in the desolate grasslands, there are often many thin branches topped with worn green leaves and wearing a yellow monk's hat. This is the ancestor of the chrysanthemum!</p>
<p>Because chrysanthemums have cold-resistant characteristics, people are very fond of them and cultivate them a lot. With each cultivation, due to the superiority of the environment and the excellence of the cultivation methods, new species are often produced. In this way, new species become new species, and there are countless kinds. Because of its beautiful posture and color, people give it very nice names, such as "Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake", "Green Robe and Red Skirt", and "Pink Xishi". These many beautiful names are all given by the elegant scholars who hold crabs and appreciate chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum leaves are oval in shape, with notches and serrations, the petioles are not long, and they are arranged alternately. Axillary buds often grow next to the leaves, and when they grow up and are inserted into damp soil, they become chrysanthemums. If we do this in the spring, we will definitely be able to see bright flowers in the autumn. Its flower axis is shortened like a plate, with petals growing on the plate, called a head-shaped inflorescence. Its corolla, like a person's tongue around it, only has pistils, and the center is like a cylinder, which has both pistils and stamens, but there are also those with all tongue-shaped or head-shaped corollas.</p>
<p>It has many brothers, such as dandelions, safflowers, and pyrethrums. In addition to being able to be admired, they can also cure diseases. Pyrethrum is truly beneficial to mankind.</p>
<h3>Short Story</h3>
<p>Somewhere there was a health propaganda team, and because they wanted to encourage everyone to kill flies, they posted many notices and said that those who killed the most flies would be rewarded.</p>
<p>Once, an honest man brought hundreds of strings of dead flies to claim the reward. When everyone saw that he had killed so many flies, they asked him where they came from. The honest man said, "I specially raised them in the pit." (By Cikai)</p>

<h3>Picking Wild Vegetables</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>——Record of a Shelter from Trouble, No. 40——</p>
<p>Trees intolerant of the cold, battered by autumn winds and rains, appear somewhat withered. Exacerbated by the fierce scraping of the northwest wind and the sting of cold frost, they are ravaged; some wither and die, others fade and fall. Yet, cold-resistant evergreen trees, though feeling the oppression of the cold wind and severe frost, still stand tall and erect, calm and unperturbed, displaying their lushness and revealing their age. On the ground, woven grasses turn yellow or die, their remains scattered in disarray, a scene of desolation. Yet, new life emerges from the ice-cracked soil amidst the harsh atmosphere, unafraid of frost or wind, propagating its kind. Wild celery, shepherd's purse, and alfalfa, at this time, present a scene of verdant richness, further demonstrating that, though small lives, they possess a strong and unyielding spirit.</p>
<p>The cold climate affected the Ming'er family's "vegetable problem," as they had not been able to buy fresh green vegetables for two days. For these two days, they had relied entirely on pork, dried vegetables, salted fish, and dried bean curd to accompany their meals, just to fill their bellies. The lack of vegetables further affected Ming'er's bowel movements, as their ease depended entirely on fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>On the third day that the "vegetable problem" arose, Ming'er's mother was washing clothes by the river when she discovered shepherd's purse, wild celery, and alfalfa in the desolate fields! The traces of these cold-resistant wild plants filled her with joy, as if Columbus had discovered a new continent. Thus, the entire Ming'er family, except for the father who stayed home to watch the door, set out en masse.</p>
<p>The mother led the team, walking along winding paths. Each person carried scissors and a basket, filled with a yearning to return laden with all the edible wild vegetables on the ground. They soon chose an area rich in wild vegetables. The group scattered as if under command, forming a skirmish line, squatting on the ground, their sharp eyes searching for their target – wild celery, shepherd's purse, alfalfa... everything that could be eaten was needed urgently.</p>
<p>In this field covered with a mixture of grass and wild vegetables, distinguishing grass from vegetables was no easy task. Ming'er, doing this for the first time, naturally found it even more difficult. He could only dig up what he thought was a vegetable and ask his mother if it was correct. After a while, he had only harvested a dozen or so plants, but the effort he spent squatting, standing, running back and forth to ask his mother far outweighed his harvest. He also felt some soreness in his joints and wanted to quit. At this moment, his older brother said, "Except for Father, anyone who doesn't work has no right to eat vegetables." Therefore, Ming'er had to persevere under this commonly agreed-upon slogan. His mother then taught him a secret: "Ming'er, if you want to distinguish shepherd's purse, it's easy. When you think it's shepherd's purse, cut it off and smell the root with your nose to see if it has the scent of shepherd's purse." Then, his mother demonstrated, and she was right every time. His mother added, "Ming'er, if you pick more shepherd's purse, we can have shepherd's purse and shredded pork tofu soup tonight. It will be delicious." This was his mother's encouragement.</p>
<p>Ming'er followed this secret, using both eyes and nose, with quick hands and feet. In no time, his harvest was abundant. Imagining the delicious tofu soup, he picked even faster. As the sun began to set, he stopped working. Wild celery, shepherd's purse, alfalfa, purslane... this was the harvest he earned with his labor, saving money and solving the "vegetable problem." That night, the tofu soup was exceptionally delicious.</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Yi Yi spotted a comfortable corner and sat down, her back resting against the roots of a large tree. The tree roots were hollow, like an armchair. She was very comfortable leaning against the roots and originally planned to take out a book and read for a while, but the sunlight was fading, and the shade of the forest made the light even weaker, so it was not suitable for reading. Moreover, her thoughts were complicated at the moment, and she really had no mood for reading.</p>
<p>Ali sat quietly, occasionally hearing strange and subtle sounds. Once or twice, she seemed to hear the sound of small feet walking by, and she seemed to hear faint, sharp laughter carried by the wind from afar. Each time Ali heard a sound, her heart beat faster. She wasn't afraid, but felt very excited.</p>
<p>She thought to herself, "If I sit here quietly and wait, who knows what new and wonderful things I'll discover. Of course, I hope the dwarfs are beautiful and dainty people—they must be smaller than the short old man I just saw walking down the street, and as delicate and lovely as the blue dwarfs at the porcelain factory. But I think they must be like fairies, neither too big nor too small, definitely smaller than that short old man but much bigger than the blue dwarfs."</p>
<p>Ali thought about the size of the dwarfs and wondered if there was actually a dwarf kingdom in this forest. Her mind was in a jumble. She thought about it again and again, but couldn't make up her mind, just muttering to herself, "As far as I can tell, those dwarfs won't be very big, maybe about the size of my thumb. Wait, what's going on?" As she was thinking this, she suddenly felt something touch her nose. She looked up, a little annoyed, wondering who dared to be so bold as to touch her nose. Maybe Ali knew I was here, so he sneaked behind me and was playing with me? But as soon as she thought of this, she felt something touch her nose again. She looked down and saw that it was a pine cone, which had fallen from the pine tree above and hit her nose.</p>

<h3>Gems of the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Yuan You</p>
<p>"China's Anti-Japanese War Newsreel No. 13, the Battle of Taierzhuang," is currently playing at the New Capital Theater in New York. Because almost all overseas Chinese in America are eager to see it first, it is a great box office success. The theater has already voluntarily offered to remit 40% of all ticket revenue to the Chinese government for refugee relief.</p>
<p>Silent comedian Buster Keaton, after leaving the silver screen, has been engaged in the steel business for seven years and has accumulated considerable wealth. Unfortunately, recent news reports that Mr. Keaton suddenly died of stomach pain at Texarkana Hospital on the evening of the 17th of last month at the age of only 43. Because his wife died four years ago and he had no children, all of his estate has been decided to be inherited by his nephew, Rudy Bekeart (a cameraman for Fox).</p>
<p>MGM suddenly dismissed seven Japanese actors, including Ryo Sanmeiko Tagame and others, this month. Although they have repeatedly requested the company authorities to provide living expenses or withdraw the order, the company authorities stated that the sudden dismissal of Japanese actors was ordered by the government and had nothing to do with the company.</p>
<p>In the second week after the outbreak of the German-Polish War, Hitler ordered filmmakers to jointly produce at least ten military films and several newsreels about the war. After more than a month of active production, seven newsreels have been completed, and some have been screened publicly in Berlin and Poland.</p>
<p>France began producing three-color stereoscopic color films in early 1932, but the results were not very satisfactory, so they once abandoned production. Recently, optical scientist Stépan has conducted many experiments and finally succeeded. It is reported that the Darny Studios in Paris has produced a stereoscopic color film called "The Virgin Who Will Marry," which will be completed in February.</p>
<h3>"Voice Translation" Listening Report</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The much-publicized "Voice Translation" was tested for the first time yesterday morning at the Grand Theater. It was a pair of crystal radio headphones (readers who have studied radio probably know the kind of headphones that you put on your head and can only listen to by yourself). The wires connecting the two headphones were plugged into the "plug" installed on the back of the seat, and clear Mandarin dialogue and explanations were received immediately, just like with a radio. Currently, 200 seats at the Grand Theater have been equipped with "Voice Translation" and are scheduled to be available starting on the 9th of this month (next Thursday). When purchasing tickets, if the audience pays an additional ten cents, they can enjoy this right.</p>
<p>The narrators are Misses Nie, Liu, and Bao. They are all university graduates and, it is said, film fans, so they are very happy to take on this heavy task. Translating English dialogue into Mandarin and sending it to the audience's ears through "Voice Translation" is not like ordinary translation, where you can wait until each line of dialogue is finished. The dialogue in movies is very fast-paced, and their translation must start at the same time as the characters in the film to avoid missing anything. Therefore, before each film is officially screened, they must first watch a trial screening, and then familiarize themselves with the English dialogue script. In this way, when the official screening begins, they can fully understand the plot and dialogue of the movie and translate it smoothly.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trial screening was Warner Baxter's "The Gay Caballero." The lady who was translating for "Voice Translation" not only translated every line of dialogue in detail, but also matched the tone of the translation with the emotions of the characters in the film. Between "fade outs" and "fade ins," she added simple plot descriptions or character introductions, which is unexpectedly effective for audiences who do not understand English dialogue at all. However, just like adding Chinese subtitles on the screen disturbs the "field of vision," "Voice Translation" will also disturb our "field of hearing" for those who understand English dialogue, whether completely or partially—at least that is my personal feeling. Perhaps this is the so-called "one cannot do two things at once."</p>

<h3>Wu Suqiu's Future Activities</h3>
<p>— Yan Luxuanzhu</p>
<p>The name Wu Suqiu was unknown in Shanghai in the past. Although she could be considered a leader among rising stars in the Peking Opera world of Beijing and Tianjin, people in Shanghai dared not believe the news from Beijing and Tianjin in the past two years. Now, Wu Suqiu has been here for more than a month and has performed in more than 20 shows. During her performances, she did not have good costumes, and the satin plaques presented by dignitaries were not used as her gimmick. She relied entirely on her strong voice, fluent singing, vivid acting, and meticulous rehearsals to establish her artistic position in Shanghai. Therefore, the audience was not very large when she first started, but the audience grew day by day. As a result, on the last day, more than 3,000 audience members did not get the opportunity to appreciate her performance. Therefore, the audience constantly demanded that the New Stage invite Wu Suqiu to perform again as their artistic sustenance. Because her contract had expired, she had to leave. Of course, the New Stage accepted the audience's opinion. After several negotiations between the two parties, a return performance at the New Stage has now become a reality.</p>
<p>In order to find out about Wu Suqiu's future activities, I made a special visit to the Central Hotel. She was using her gifted brush to paint a chrysanthemum fan with yellow ink, vivid and energetic. I asked her about the plays she would perform in the future. She said that the performances would still focus on new plays, with occasional cross-dressing plays as a kind of maiden attempt. The more important ones include "Hibiscus Sword," "Zhang Yuzhen," "The Complete Pan Qiaoyun," "Woman Hitting Sticks Out of a Box," "Peach Blossom Human Face," "Ba Luohe," "Madam White," etc., which are all in preparation. The play "Little Cowherd" is not performed lightly and may be performed within the realm of possibility. She hopes to meet the needs of a large number of audience members with newer postures, hardworking performances, excellent scripts, and precise rehearsals.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Strange Reunion of Wang Yunfang and His Son</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Huang Yurong was also present, and Mr. Xu Langxi introduced him to the Lao Gong stage. Later, he successively transferred to the Da Xin, Tianchan, and other stages. However, since arriving in Shanghai to sing, he resumed the Wang surname and changed his name to Yunfang. Two months ago, my uncle came to Shanghai from a town very close to Shanghai to watch a play. He saw Yu's name and appearance at Tianchan and was greatly surprised. He returned and told my father that the appearance was similar to my father's, and that the Yun character was also the character used in the ranking of our generation. He then read magazines and opera newspapers and learned about Yu's affairs in Shandong in great detail. He then tried to send a letter to the backstage of Tianchan. When I first received this letter, I suspected that Shanghai was a den of all kinds of evils and that this kind of thing happened frequently, so I simply ignored it. Later, my uncle and father came to watch a play together. My father saw Yu's age and appearance, which closely resembled Yu's situation when he was seven years old. He calculated the age, which was also the same. He then wrote a letter to Yu, describing in detail the past events of leaving home. From then on, Yu began to believe a little and first asked for a photo to read, and then took him to live in the Shanghai residence. For many days, seeing his dignified demeanor, few words in peacetime, and no other hobbies besides managing Buddha, he learned that his nerves had indeed suffered a major stimulus. Moreover, if he was not mentally ill, he would never abandon Yu's mother and son and not communicate for twenty years. Finally, Yunfang said that the separation and reunion of life is not strange, but what is strange is that after Yu changed his name, Mr. Shaoqing randomly took a Yun character, and this character was the same as Yu's generation character. Therefore, Yu's uncle paid attention and the father and son were reunited. Is it really the reward for Yu's love of Buddha? (134)</p>
<p>Short News The Shanghai Yaleshe was founded by Shanghai musicians Zhu Wenrui, Wu Zilin, Xiang Fumei, etc. It has been 22 years since then. The members are students from various universities and churches in Shanghai who have a long-standing love for vocal music. It is heard that the club will hold a concert on Christmas Day and is actively preparing for it. Today, at the invitation of Moore Hall, it will be responsible for the worship music program in the hall. The night before, it held a friendship party at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association and welcomed new members, which was very popular for a while.</p>

<h3>The Current Master of Japan's Kasumigaseki: General Nomura's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>Appointed Foreign Minister Because He Is a Friend of America: See If He Has the Means to Achieve What Is Expected of Him</p>
<p>A Figurehead Foreign Minister</p>
<p>In Japan, it is a common occurrence for a member of the army or navy to serve as a cabinet member. In the past, there were Saito and Okada who served as prime minister, and Ugaki who served as foreign minister. With the formation of the Abe cabinet, Nomura Kichisaburo, a naval admiral, appeared as a friend of America and became the master of Kasumigaseki. Can he display his ambitions and achieve what the Japanese people expect of him? Of course, the fundamental foreign policy of one country toward another will never shift because of changes in personnel in another country. Moreover, in the eyes of the military men in his own country who control diplomacy, Nomura's accession to power is merely a "figurehead," used for decoration and appearance, without any great expectations of him. His country's powerful figures have already expressed such an attitude towards him, so it is conceivable what achievements he can make in diplomatic negotiations, especially in relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai to Fight During the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>Speaking of General Nomura, of course, he is a familiar figure to us. After the January 28th Incident, Nomura was the one who led the Japanese Navy with Shiozawa to fight against the 19th Route Army. At that time, he was still a lieutenant general. On April 19, when the Japanese military and civilians were celebrating the Emperor's Birthday in Hongkou, they were injured by a bomb thrown by a Korean, blinding one eye. After returning to his country, he was given an artificial eye by the Emperor. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in Annapolis and once served as a naval attache in Washington, DC. At that time, the current US President Roosevelt was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, so he became acquainted with Roosevelt. The so-called best friend of America is because of this relationship.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Reaching a New Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary Japanese, he is extremely tall, almost six feet tall and weighs two hundred pounds. He is quite gentle in nature, always silent and seldom speaks at meetings, sometimes dozing or smiling. This kind of good guy, at this time when Japan is besieged on all sides, holds the heavy responsibility of diplomacy, and it is feared that it will not be as easy for him to break the current deadlock as people in other countries imagine! The deterioration of Japanese-American relations was not caused overnight, and the problems involved are numerous. The most important one is naturally the issue of American interests in China, which in turn involves the basic US policy toward the Far East, such as the Open Door Policy of the Nine-Power Treaty, and equal opportunities, opening the Pearl River and the Yangtze River, etc. On the one hand, these problems are the result of Japan's military actions over the past few years. On the other hand, Japan's promotion of the Asian Monroe Doctrine and the recent so-called New Order in the Far East are fundamentally contrary to the US policy toward China. Therefore, for Nomura to negotiate successfully with the United States and reach a new treaty of navigation, it is no different from looking for fish in trees. Let's listen to his recent confession. He recently admitted to the cabinet that "the hope of improving Japanese-American relations is very slim." According to him, this is due to the firm anti-Japanese attitude of the United States. Therefore, he is deeply afraid that after the expiration of the Japanese-American trade agreement in January next year, the relations between the two countries will become even more serious. However, he did not mention any measures to eliminate such a serious situation. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said that he did not recognize the news of the opening of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, saying that the Japanese government and the Foreign Ministry have not considered such events at this moment. This means that Japan has not considered the issue of the dispute between the United States and Japan, so there is no possibility of rapprochement between the United States and Japan, and how easy is it to adjust national relations!</p>
<p>The Farce of Building a New Central Government</p>
<p>Since Nomura has no way to break the deadlock between Japan and the United States, his future diplomatic policy will fundamentally follow the military, assisting the so-called "New Central Government of China" and carrying out the so-called "gigantic responsibility of building East Asia" with a so-called "determined determination," while at the same time making the United States "able to correctly understand this purpose and the determination of Japan." This is tantamount to demonstrating to the United States, indicating that Japan is still "doing its own thing." In addition to recognizing the New Order in the Far East, the United States has no room for bargaining. Although this strategy comes from Nomura, who claims to be a friend of the United States, I am afraid that the United States will not appreciate it!</p>
<h3>A Corner of the Battlefield: Shaoguan, An Important Town in Northern Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>The Commercial District Was Reduced to Ashes Under the Brutal Bombing of Japanese Planes</p>
<p>Shaoguan, also known as Qujiang, is located at the confluence of the Zhen and Wu Rivers, and is the gateway to and from Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, Hunan. It has been a strategic location for soldiers since ancient times. When Premier Sun led his army on the Northern Expedition, the Grand Marshal's Office was located in Shaoguan, where military affairs were planned, laying the foundation for the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army. In 1926, Chiang Kai-shek also swore to the Northern Expedition in Shaoguan, so it is worthy of our commemoration in the process of the National Revolution. After the fall of Guangzhou, the center of gravity of the war shifted to northern Guangdong, and Shaoguan's military status became increasingly important. It not only shrank the war in northern Guangdong, but also centrally supported the wars in eastern and western Guangdong. With the expansion of the entire situation in the southern battlefield, it has gradually grown stronger.</p>
<p>Active Traffic</p>
<p>Shaoguan's transportation is very convenient. On land, the Yuehan Railway extends north to Changsha and south to Guangzhou. On the highway, the spider web-like highway lines in northern Guangdong all take Shaoguan as the connection point. In terms of waterways, the Beijiang River reaches Xianggan in the north and Guangzhou in the south, with sailing ships and transport ships weaving back and forth. Since the military uprising, these transport routes have been the main arteries for the transportation of military supplies and troops.</p>
<p>Magnificent City Appearance</p>
<p>In recent years, the existence of various major conditions has made it quickly dyed in the form of a modern city. Solid and flat Bashan Road and cement-steel buildings continue to appear in Shaoguan City, decorating it as a modern city. Zhongshan, Minquan, Minsheng and other roads are very magnificent. In terms of finance, the establishment of banks such as China, Farmers, and Guangdong has also improved the situation of stagnation in the past. In terms of culture, in addition to the original Beijiang Daily, there are also the Dagang Bao and Zhengzhong Bao, which moved from Chongyang, and the sales are good. Wall newspapers can be seen everywhere on the streets. There are also several periodicals. In terms of commerce, because this is the distribution center for goods from all over Beijiang, although there are no very large-scale shops, Shaoguan is second to none among the cities in Beijiang.</p>
<p>Brutal Bombing</p>
<p>After countless brutal bombings by Japanese planes, the prosperous commercial district has become a ruin with no intact houses. Looking around, the city is full of bomb craters. But despite the constant bombing by Japanese planes, the enthusiasm and solemnity of the people's emotions are admirable. Whenever the air raid alarm sounded sharply, the people calmly took refuge in the suburbs. When Japanese planes flew over Shaoguan, there was no one in the city. Often many bombs were dropped and many houses collapsed, but no one was killed or injured by the ruthless shrapnel. Our military and political leaders are stationed here, planning the war in Guangdong Province, and not allowing the Japanese army to fulfill its dream of opening up the Yuehan Road.</p>
<p>Famous Scenic Spots</p>
<p>The scenic spots in Shaoguan include the Qushi Rock in the eastern city, with 36 stones arranged in a row to the east, strange and beautiful. Whenever it is sunny after rain, looking from a distance, it seems that there are wisps of clouds rising, called "Shaoshi Sheng Yun", which is listed as the first of the twenty-four scenes of Qujiang. According to legend, the ancient sage ruler Yu Shun once ascended this stone to play Shaole, and the names of Shaozhou and Qujiang are taken from this. Ten miles south of the city, there is Nanhua Temple, which was built by the Indian monk Zhiyao during the Tianjian period of the Liang Dynasty. Huineng, the sixth ancestor of the Tang Dynasty, once lived here to preach, and the sixth ancestor's clothes and body are still in the temple today.</p>
<p>Since General Zhang Xianghua came to Shaoguan to take office, the various party, government, and military organizations have been united much more. Everyone is working together to carry out in-depth salvation work among the people. Military leaders Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, Ye Jianying, and others have also visited Shaoguan successively to inspect the area, giving the people even more enthusiastic encouragement. Therefore, although Shaoguan today is full of bullet holes, the new shoots are drawn from the scorched earth. In the near future, it will inevitably become a base for recovering Guangzhou, recovering all lost land, and even striving for national independence and liberation!</p>
<h3>Short Biographies: Eden</h3>
<p>Recently, according to [Walter] Lippmann in his article "England, Awake!", "The selection of British government personnel only seeks those with suitable backgrounds." Therefore, most British officials are from aristocratic families. The former Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden is one of them; however, although Eden was accustomed to the aristocratic life, he was not like other nobles, always seeking to avoid trouble and acting timidly. He was greatly dissatisfied with Hitler's aggression and Chamberlain's appeasement policy during the Czech crisis and resigned because of this.</p>
<p>Eden was born in 1897. His mother was a socialite in London society, and his father was a baronet. Eden was very handsome and liked to dress up, and his clothes were very fashionable. His older and younger brothers all died in the last Great War. He himself was attacked by poison gas in the Battle of the Ypres, almost losing his life, so it can be said that he escaped from death.</p>
<p>After he resigned as Foreign Secretary, unlike the high-ranking officials in our ancient times who retired to the forests and springs to enjoy the leisurely life of "pine wind blowing the belt loose, mountain moon shining on the zither," he still hoped to serve the country and volunteered for the army. The army, because he had served in the rifle regiment in the previous Great War and was familiar with the work, still assigned him to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Rifle Corps. At this moment, he is looking into the distance with a telescope, it can be said that a hero has a place to use his talents.</p>
<p>Economic Common Sense</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports During a Naval Blockade</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>Matters Needing Attention by Importers and Exporters During Wartime</p>
<p>Wartime Contraband</p>
<p>In principle, neutral countries still have the freedom to trade with belligerent countries; however, in reality, they cannot but be subject to the constraints and restrictions of the belligerent countries. Selling "wartime contraband" to belligerent party A will result in confiscation if captured by party B; conversely, it will be confiscated by party A. Everyone knows this. What is contraband? Both sides of the European war have already announced it, and lists of items can be obtained from their respective embassies and consulates. There is no time to list them here, but they are generally divided into two categories: absolutely prohibited and conditionally prohibited. The former includes weapons, ammunition, war equipment, fuel, raw materials, currency and property, military maps, etc. The latter includes food, feed, clothing, and their raw materials, etc. However, there are complicated regulations when determining the nature of the goods and whether they are supplied to the enemy. According to international law:</p>
<p>Provisions Under Public Law</p>
<p>(A) If exported by a neutral country, such as absolutely prohibited items; in the following circumstances, it shall be confiscated unconditionally: (1) The ship's documents state that it is being transported to an enemy port or supplied to the enemy army. (2) Goods carried on ships that go directly to enemy ports without stopping at other ports; (3) Even ships going to neutral ports, but first passing through enemy ports or ships that may encounter enemy forces.</p>
<p>(B) Conditionally prohibited items exported by neutral countries may be determined to be supplied to the enemy in the following circumstances; however, evidence to the contrary may be presented. Whether it will be confiscated? It will be decided by the shipping inspection office or the captured goods court. (1) Supplying enemy government offices; (2) Supplying enemy merchants who transfer it to the enemy government; (3) Transporting it to the enemy's base or its rear supply station; (4) Transporting it to an agent of the enemy government or a commercial organization under the supervision of the enemy government.</p>
<p>(C) The disposition of these prohibited items and the carrying vessels shall be determined by the nationality of the vessel:</p>
<p>Confiscation of Contraband</p>
<p>Transported by neutral ships: (1) Ships transporting contraband shall be arrested, regardless of their nationality. (2) The captured contraband shall be confiscated in its entirety. (3) If the value, weight, volume, or freight payable of the captured contraband is equal to more than half of any of the total value, total quantity, total volume, or total freight revenue of the ship's cargo, the ship may be confiscated. (4) Non-contraband items on the same ship belonging to the same owner as the contraband shall also be confiscated; otherwise, they may be released, but may be temporarily detained for inspection. (5) According to the provisions of the London Declaration on the issue of prohibited items, ships transporting prohibited items that were sailing at sea before the outbreak of war or before the declaration of prohibited items, and have not had time to land the goods, shall be compensated at the time of confiscation.</p>
<p>Transported by enemy ships: (1) Confiscate the ship. (2) Confiscate all the goods it carries. (3) The non-contraband items among them, owned by neutral countries, shall in principle be returned, but strong evidence must be presented.</p>
<p>Neutral country merchants who fulfill contracts after the outbreak of war and transport goods to enemy country merchants shall be treated as enemy goods, regardless of whether they are especially shipped. Therefore, even if the goods carried by enemy ships belong to neutral countries, they are still subject to confiscation.</p>
<p>(D) When importing from belligerent countries, there is in principle freedom; however, it is limited to the presentation of evidence to prove that it was sold by enemy country merchants to neutral country merchants. Otherwise, or in the case of transportation by enemy ships, there is still a risk of confiscation. According to the precedents of the British Prize Court in the European War, if the payment for the goods has been fully paid before shipment, the above-mentioned rights may be invoked and the ownership is recognized as belonging to the neutral country. Otherwise, it will still be treated as enemy goods. Here, France detained German products passing through the sea defense because their ownership already belonged to Chinese merchants, so they have now obtained the understanding of the French side and allowed them to be released; this is the reason.</p>
<p>Preliminary Export Certificate</p>
<p>China can only export raw materials, food, etc.; most of the inspections along the way are by the British Navy. If it is shipped to Germany, it is obviously absolutely dangerous. Even if it is shipped to other countries, it must be fully prepared! According to the announcement issued by the Central Consulate in Shanghai, all ships carrying goods to Europe, regardless of their nationality, should prepare a certificate of goods, clearly stating the name of the person handling the goods, and not just write the word "order"; in order to accept inspection along the way.</p>

<p>Social Investigation</p>
<h3>Renji Nursery</h3>
<p>— Xu Jieying</p>
<p>The author made a special visit to the Renji Nursery in the afternoon the day before yesterday. Mr. Hu Fuqing, the director of the nursery, received me and sincerely led me on a tour and explained in detail, which made me understand many of the internal situations.</p>
<p>Indoor Equipment</p>
<p>Although the Renji Nursery is an old-style alley house, the rooms are spacious, with plenty of sunlight and good ventilation. There are three large infant bedrooms, and the interior layout is also neat. There are about 100 infants in the three rooms. Each infant is wearing a soft and warm cotton-padded jacket, covered with a clean cotton quilt, and sleeps on a new-style small iron bed.</p>
<p>The Renji Nursery was originally part of the Renji Charity Hall.</p>
<p>The Process of Establishment</p>
<p>Because they wanted to do more work for the welfare of infants, the nursery was organized separately five or sixty years ago. At first, the site was next door to the Renji Charity Hall, and the scope was very small. Later, because the number of abandoned children increased day by day, it had to be expanded, so it was moved to Race Course Road, which is already more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Ratio of Men and Women</p>
<p>The Renji Nursery adopts many infants every year, totaling about eight or nine hundred. Because there is still the idea of valuing men over women in society, female infants are far more than male infants among the abandoned children. Among the eight or nine hundred infants adopted each year, the number of male infants never exceeds one hundred!</p>
<p>Placement Procedures</p>
<p>Some nurseries put a rotating drawer outside the door. The parents of the abandoned children put their children in the drawer, press the bell, and the people inside will hear the bell and turn the drawer to take the infants in. However, the situation in the Renji Nursery is different. The parents of the abandoned children should write down the time and date of birth of their children, send them to the gatehouse, and hand them over to the accounting office for registration and retention. As for the reasons why the infants were abandoned, they do not investigate in detail.</p>
<p>Wet Nurses for Infants</p>
<p>Each person only needs to feed two infants, so the children's nutrition is still sufficient. However, most of the infants sent to the nursery are unhealthy, so they also hire Chinese and Western doctors to examine the infants every day. In addition, there are ten nurses who take turns taking care of the infants. Among them, there is a child who is more than one year old. It is said that when he was sent here two months ago, he was very weak, but now he has been raised to be white and rosy, and is learning to walk very vigorously. In addition to the nurses, there are three female administrators responsible for supervising the work of the wet nurses. Such an organization and such a work policy can truly be called perfect.</p>
<p>Taking the Infants Out</p>
<p>Although many infants are sent in, many are also taken out. As long as you find a reliable guarantor and pay a small amount of milk money, you can choose the infant you like and take it out, so the better infants have been taken out. Most of those who stay in the hall are newborn infants, and the oldest are still just babbling. As for the education and future of the infants after they grow up, it is a matter worth considering.</p>
<p>Future Development</p>
<p>The economy of the Renji Nursery can be said to be entirely borne by the Renji Charity Hall. Because the work of caring for infants is still not sufficiently noticed by society, there are no external donations. Relying solely on the assistance of the Renji Charity Hall to help these poor abandoned children is already not an easy task, so it is even more difficult to fully develop. After the August 13th Incident, people's livelihood became difficult, and the number of abandoned infants also increased day by day, so the work of caring for infants and helping refugees has the same importance, and how to make the work of caring for infants fully progress is a problem that cannot be ignored at present.</p>
<h3>Hitler's English Lover</h3>
<p>— You Yide · Mitford</p>
<p>The English young lady Unity Mitford is the daughter of Lord Redesdale. She is an ardent admirer of Hitler. She used to have close relations with Hitler and became Hitler's confidante. For a period of time, rumors circulated that she had also become a German citizen. But she strongly denied these rumors, saying that this was not the case.</p>
<p>Her close relationship with Hitler can be proven by her participation in various important ceremonies of the National Socialist Party. Last year, after Germany annexed Austria, when Hitler went to Vienna, the capital of Austria, Miss Unity also followed Hitler to that place. A few weeks before the outbreak of the war between England and Germany this year, she went to Munich for a vacation trip. After the outbreak of the war, she did not leave Germany like other British overseas Chinese, but seemed to be staying in Germany for a long time. According to the latest Havas news, when she went to Munich to see Hitler, she had a dispute with Hitler because Hitler scolded Britain, and was therefore greatly stimulated. She returned to the hotel and committed suicide by taking sleeping pills that night. It was not discovered until the next morning that she was unconscious. Later, she was sent to a sanatorium for treatment and was fortunately rescued.</p>
<h3>The Realization of Telepathy: A Brief Discussion on Television</h3>
<p>In our country's old novels, there are fantasies such as Clairaudience and Clairvoyance, saying that sounds and scenery thousands of miles away can be heard and seen; but many people admit that this is just a novelist's nonsense. Since the invention of wireless electricity, similar wonders have been realized one by one. For example, wireless telephones are very similar to Clairaudience. Although the broadcasting station is far away, its beautiful music and expressive speeches can be received by the radio as if they were in the same room. This is well known to women and children, so there is no need to repeat it. As for what is similar to Clairvoyance? It is television. Television projects the movements of people, etc., into the transmitter, causing the current in the machine to change, either stronger or weaker, becoming lightning waves and transmitting them to a distance. If there is a receiver, these electrical waves are received and restored to images, so there is "seeing with one's own eyes," isn't this Clairvoyance?</p>
<p>When Will it Arrive in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Wireless telephone radios can now be found everywhere in the streets and alleys. When will a television transmitter arrive in Shanghai? This question is quite difficult to answer; but we can speculate. Originally, the first radio broadcasting station was established in the United States in 1920. Five years later (1925), an American company in Shanghai, Kailuo Company, built a 250-watt broadcasting station on Nanjing Road. Before the establishment of this station, the ECO broadcasting station had already been established, but it was experimental in nature, so we will not discuss it for the time being. If Kailuo is used as the standard, the establishment of radio broadcasting stations in China and foreign countries is only five years apart. Now television is being publicly demonstrated at the Golden Gate Exposition in the United States. As of May of this year, there are 23 registered television transmitters in the United States, three of which are mobile and the others are fixed. The largest power is Wzxep, and the wavelength of 6.5 meters to 4 meters is the most common. Therefore, 1939 is the year when television was truly realized in the United States. If we use this as an example, then in another five years (1944), a television transmitter should be established in Shanghai. Although it may be a little earlier or later due to personnel and other reasons, this guess based on reason can be said to be "close even if not accurate."</p>
<p>The Main Points of Television Work</p>
<p>In 1930, both transmitters and receivers used the old rotary method, which used mechanical motion. Later, after Dr. Zworykin and others devoted themselves to research, they adopted a new method called the "cathode ray system." Originally, the reason why the eyes can see people is that people can reflect light rays of different strengths to the eyes, and transmit them to the brain, which then causes the "seeing" effect. Now, these light rays of different strengths are reflected into a device called a photoelectric tube, and through its action, electrical waves of different strengths are generated and emitted in all directions. As for the receiver, there is a long glass tube, one end of which is flat. The received electrical waves pass through the machine, and the image appears on its flat surface. This kind of glass tube is commonly called a cathode ray tube, and some have a mirror at one end. The position of this tube is on the upper part of the machine, and below it is the speaker for emitting sound.</p>
<p>The best image has an area of 70 square inches. The clarity of the image is managed with a spherical knob. The minimum is an area of 12 square inches, which is only suitable for home use. As for the parts and construction methods of the transmitter and receiver, those who already know the installation and principle of wireless telephones can also learn by analogy, and it is not difficult to understand. However, the average reader may not be interested in studying it, and it is impossible to describe it in detail in this short article.</p>
<p>The Value of the Receiver</p>
<p>Talking about the value of the receiver is really shocking, because television is still in its infancy, and there are not many machine products, so the cost is expensive, and the selling price has to be expensive. Another reason is that things are valued because they are rare, and manufacturers inevitably overcharge. Now a better receiver costs 300 to 500 US dollars, and the minimum is 150 to 200 US dollars. If it is converted into our country's legal currency at the current exchange rate, the lowest price is also more than 2,100 yuan, and the highest price is more than 7,000 yuan, which is calculated according to the HSBC listing. However, we remember that after the January 28th Incident ended hastily, within half a year, radio stations in Shanghai sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. Therefore, in the future, when the War of Resistance is successfully completed, television transmitters will surely rise like a storm.</p>
<p>October 4th and 15th: The Chinese Air Force Bombed the Japanese Airport in Hankou, Destroying a Total of More Than 150 Japanese Aircraft</p>
<h3>Scientific Snippets</h3>
<p>There is currently an experiment in the UK to change the stone or cement pieces on the edges of street roads to glass in order to seek safety in nighttime traffic.</p>
<p>In order to save leather, Germany has invented a new type of coating to paint the soles of shoes. This is made by mixing sand and other granular materials. It is said that after using this type of coating, the shoes become very strong.</p>
<p>In order to save metals such as steel, a Japanese company is planning to use celluloid to make tap water pipes.</p>
<h3>Alarm Clock</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Ordinary people only use alarm clocks when getting up in the morning. But in fact, alarm clocks have a wide range of uses. Anything that requires precise timekeeping to prevent forgetting can be used. For example,</p>
<p>Radio broadcasts of programs that you want to listen to;</p>
<p>When cooking or stir-frying side dishes and need to leave the kitchen temporarily;</p>
<p>The scheduled time for children to drink milk;</p>
<p>The patient's medication time;</p>
<p>Preparing to go out,</p>
<p>Etc. The use in the family is really exceptionally wide</p>
<p>Extensive and beneficial.</p>
<h3>Wartime Small News</h3>
<p>In order to make the soldiers believe that Germany has sufficient food reserves, the German authorities are showing a film in Berlin called The Main Food of the German Army. However, what the film shows is only a small part of the stored pork. On the other hand, the United Kingdom is also showing a film that shows the bustling center of London and mountains of various goods and trucks carrying them, making Germany pale in comparison.</p>
<p>Two tons of coffee exclusively for Hitler's personal consumption have been seized at the port of Aden in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>According to the British Daily Telegraph: Karl Radek, a Soviet political commentator, was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1937 for secretly colluding with the German National Socialist Party. He was released without charge long ago. Since March of this year, he has begun to organize Polish communists in Moscow to prepare for the "reddening" of Poland. According to a Paris newspaper, Radek grew up in Poland and has now been commissioned by the Soviet government to be the main person in charge of "reddening" the Polish part occupied by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Paris Opera will continue to perform in Paris or Nantes. The Comédie-Française, although it was once declared closed after the start of the war, has now reopened and has built a solid bomb shelter. In the event of an aircraft bombing, the audience can run into the shelter to take refuge.</p>
<p>The scenery in Paris is slightly bleak compared to before the war, but the night is not as dark as hell like in London. Because the British are very strict with lighting control, it is dark and without light at night. The street lights in France still shine as usual at night, except when there is an alarm, but they are not very bright. Also, there is a general mechanism for street lights during alarms. When the general mechanism is turned on, all the street lights in the city go out.</p>

<h3>Records of Minor Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhou Daming</p>
<p>There are six different kinds of fleas and lice on the body of an eagle. Each louse occupies a part of the eagle's body and does not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>Human ears have degenerated and cannot move like cats and dogs. The cecum has also degenerated and cannot be as developed as in rabbits. The tail has also degenerated, and traces of the coccyx can still be faintly felt. The male breast has also degenerated and is not as developed as the female breast.</p>
<p>The southern United States is mostly engaged in agriculture. Before the Civil War, black slaves were regarded as livestock, freely bought and sold, and used as cattle and horses. "Southland Orphan" depicts the tragic history of black slaves being abused. This song is the interlude in the film.</p>
