<p>社評</p>
<h3>贛北大捷</h3>
<p>旬日以來，華軍在贛北，建立了空前的勝利：克復高安，大城，包圍南昌，奉新。武寗。這些捷報，在軍事上可以打破日軍西犯株長的既定計劃，粉碎它分裂第三和第九戰區的迷夢；在政治上可以肅淸傀儡的投降理論，堅定抗戰必勝的信念。它將成為日本侵華軍事總崩潰的喪鐘，也就是中國取得最後勝利的前奏曲。</p>
<p>原來日軍在攻陷南昌以後，就調集重兵於贛北，圖分兩路犯湘：一經大城高安，沿公路犯萬載萍鄉，直撲株州；一以武寗做據點，沿修河向鄂南的通山通城移動，經平江以取長沙。可是贛省地勢，北低南高，易攻難守，日軍在進攻南昌的時候，未能先在鄱陽湖兩岸獲得堅强據點，孤軍深入，行險徼倖，已自陷於被包圍消滅的絕境，那裘還能利用南昌來做犯湘的根據？果然，華軍於有計劃地退出南昌以後，就運用主動戰術，分路反攻，南路克高安大城，包圍南昌，奉新，斬斷日軍侵犯湘省的一隻臂膀；北路包圍武寗，使日軍無法西進；同時鄂南華軍，也收復通山，截斷日軍由鄂南犯湘的通路。這些，不但暴露了日軍侵湘軍事佈置的空虛，又顯示出中國軍隊，已逐漸取得了主動的地位。此後如日軍不能重行佔領上述各個據點，則其犯湘的企圖，是無法實現了。</p>
<p>其次，日軍在進攻南昌的時候，本懷着一種幻想，以為攻陷南昌以後，就可把第三戰區和第九戰區分割開來，使第三戰區完全陷於孤立，則在該戰區的華軍，易於消滅，京滬杭各地的威脅可以减輕，且進一步，還可以藉此切斷浙贛鐵路。浙贛鐵路是中國東南的經濟動脈，又為東南和西南的交通要道，一被切斷，則中國抗戰的實力，自要受到很大的打擊的。但是幻想終是幻想，不能成為事實，而在今日華軍克復南昌，這幻想更其被粉碎凈盡了。</p>
<p>自華軍開始反攻以來，捷音頻傳，收復失地，原已達七十餘處；但像南昌這樣重要的據點，失而復得，尤其有重大的意義。蓋當前次華軍有計劃地退出南昌的時候，一般惟武器論者和對抗戰信念不堅定的人們，都以為華軍是被迫退出的，並不是戰略的關係。他們對抗戰必勝的信念，更發生了動搖。於是日本就利用這種弱點，通過傀儡的喉舌，散佈許多誘降的理論，以圖分散中國抗戰的實力而遂其速和速決的陰謀。現在這種陰謀，也被在贛北反攻的數十萬勇士所粉碎了。同時證實了以前華軍的退出南昌，確是有計劃的；它的目的，一方面在避免實力的過大損失，另一方面却在誘日軍深入，以便予以痛擊。所以在未被佔領以前，華軍先給以猛烈的打擊，盡量消耗它的實力；待既被佔領之後，又在它的四週，予以猛烈的包圍，削弱日軍的實力；終則乘其立足未穩，遂即反攻。所以這决贛北的大捷，不但喚醒了惟武器論者和懷疑抗戰必勝的人們的錯覺，並且肅淸了妥協投降的理論，增强了全國抗戰的勇氣。</p>

<h3>希特勒發表演說　駁覆羅斯福各項建議　宣佈廢止英德兩國海軍協定　德波互不侵犯條約</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒元首頃於本日正午在衆議院發表長篇演說、答覆美國總統羅斯福刪電、其要點如下、（一）德國對於羅斯福總統所提及之各國、願在相互的條件之下、予以保障、（二）英德兩國海軍協定宣吿廢止、（三）德國要求收回舊有殖民地、但此不足以構成戰爭理由、（四）德波兩國互不侵犯協定、已不復存在、（五）德國對於法德兩國現行邊界所提供之保證仍當信守不渝、（六）德國在西班牙國境內之志願兵、希望能在參加國民軍以凱旋式進入瑪德里城之後撤回本國云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）希特勒元首今午發表演說、答復羅斯福總統、並毅然宜吿於世曰、德國已廢除英德海軍協定、並認一九三四年締結之德波協定已不復存在、但德國準備與英波兩國、將有關之問題、進行談判、德法之間、自德國收回薩爾之後、已無領土問題作梗、德國對英、不過要求歸還殖民地而已、至於西班牙境內之德籍志願兵、在國民軍奏凱入瑪德里之後、卽將返德、不成問題、</p>
<h3>希特勒演說姿勢</h3>
<p>希特勒對歐洲政治之態度、旣撮要述明、乃轉其鋒抨擊羅斯福總統之電文曰、自一九一八年以還世界上發生戰爭不下十四决、而德國不與焉、是以羅斯福在道義上不應向德國提出呼籲、無確鑿之證據、卽抨擊他國、不惟擾亂寗靖之秩序、亦卽妨害世界之和平、希氏復追溯德國人民對於威爾遜十四點之失望、謂德國今後永不派遣代表參加類似法庭之國際會議、至於羅氏耍求德國宣布今後之政策一點、則予以拒絕、謂本人僅對德國人民負責、不涉其他、惟羅斯福總統指明受德國威脅之國、彼已分別諮詢各國意見、彼等是吾感受威脅、是吾授意羅氏而出此、各國答復皆曰、否、且有少數答復、予以嚴峻之吾認者、此事之眞相、不言可喩矣、至於謠傳德國有侵犯美洲頭土之企圖、則屬無稽之言、全不足信、要之、自國社黨執政以來、德國一再提出限制軍備之建議、悉遭拒絕、然德國渴望和平之志願、仍未消滅、</p>
<h3>希特勒念念不忘　凡爾賽和約罪惡</h3>
<p>希特勒開塲即論及羅斯福總統之呼籲電文、謂「美國大總統曾有電報致余、其離奇之內容、巳為君等所共知、事實上在余尙未接到此項電文之前、因無綫電及報章之宜傳、已成舉世週知、同時因民主國家報章之無數評論、似欲使吾等領悟、此項電報、係向有採取戰爭措施責任的國家、所提出精巧而聰明之公文、余自秉政以來、即抱定惟一宗旨、即恢復德國民族之自由、除此之外、別無所求、余所努力者、惟在恢復前此被人以武力所剝奪者、今日之大德國、絕未包括任何古時非德國之領土、易言之、白種人發現美洲大陸之前、德國之領土、不僅與今日相同、抑且較今日為大、蓋尙有若干省份區域、其後已經失去也、以理而論、凡盡忠責任為國家民族作戰者、均應享受合理而公正之和平、顧事實竟大謬不然、千百萬人、均受和平之欺騙、此即德國人及其他友軍之受凡爾賽和的之禍害是也、凡爾賽和約者、嫉仇惡意不合理之結晶體也、其結果使一萬萬一千五百萬人民、非被戰勝軍人、而係被瘋狂政客、剝奪其民族自決之權利、脫離其祖國、不問其血統來源經濟生活種種原素、武斷的併入新的團體、造成悲慘之結果、當時所謂民主帝國之政治家、自以世界新秩序之獨裁者自居、儼然以解決各民族間問題為己任、迨此種新秩序發生危機、歐美政治家、竟各葳蕤退縮不敢負其責任、惟交相怪責、以圖避免歷史之裁判、其實使吾民族受禍之國家不勝枚舉、刦奪其所有殖民地、剝削其一切財政富源、而驅使吾國至最悲慘黑暗之時代、（二十八日海通電）</p>

<h3>邱吉爾快人快語　謂希特勒演說不足重視</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院辯論徵兵案時、歐戰時任海相之邱吉爾曾發演說、贊許實行徵兵制。謂此純為英國之計畫、而非因希特勒明日演說之結果、此演說無關重要、如有威脅之詞、則大局已惡矣、不致因以更惡、如有安定人心之詞、則非以事實證明、不能置信、如其詞全屬謾駡、則吾人何必注意之、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>英志在包圍德國　海軍協定應廢止</h3>
<p>於是希特勒評論英德之關係曰、余一向主張敦睦英德之邦交、增進兩國之合作、不列顚帝國對於人類文化與經濟生活、貢獻甚大、自無疑義、安格羅薩克遜人對於殖民事業所建樹之成績、余欽佩之、但除非安格羅薩克遜人於尊重不列顚之利益外、亦承認德國人之利益、吾則日耳曼人與安格羅薩克遜人之友誼、斷無保持之可能、所謂敬人者、人恒敬之是也、余聞英國首相曾發表今後不能再信任德國之保證等語、若然、吾今後亦不希望彼個人或不列顚人民再保持互相信任之觀念、當國社黨執政之始、余為敦睦英德之邦交計、曾建議自動的限制德國海軍之軍備、但該項限制具有一重要之條件、條件為何、英德兩國間再無戰爭可能之信心是也、迄今余之信心仍在、但英國之信心業已動搖、倫敦方面之意見、多認為今後德國若一旦與他國發生衝突、英國將立於與德為敵之地位、不惟私人之言論如此、報章之論調、甚至官方之言論、亦認為英國須敵視德國、實行包圍德國之政策、然則海的之基礎、已被移去、余豈可緘默坐視乎、是以今日願以已見達於英國政府之前曰、英國政府如願再與德國談判此事、余仍欣然願從、俾能獲得一淸晰爽直之諒解、吾則德國激於自尊之念、不能避免海軍軍備之競爭矣、</p>
<h3>但澤問題須解決　謂波蘭拒絕建議</h3>
<p>希氏繼而論及德國與其他各國所締經濟協定之重要、申明德國乃各小國之最大消費者、而並非欲利用商務條的、將各小國納入政治之範疇、</p>
<p>至於德國對波蘭關係、雖戰後德國巳負創傷、仍與波蘭締結友好條的、該的使歐洲緊張、因之和緩、但德波間尙存一種早晚必須解決之問題、即但澤自由市之問題是也、余認為此項問題、若得和平解决、其對歐局之貢獻、至重且大、經數月之談判、乃於數月前向波蘭政府提出方案、其內容茲分佈如左、</p>
<p>（一）但澤市歸還德國、成為德國版圖之自由邦、</p>
<p>（二）德國接受波蘭走廊之路綫、並得在該處建造鐵路、與波蘭享受同樣治外領權、</p>
<p>同時德國方面提出五種條件、以作交換、</p>
<p>（一）承認波蘭在但澤之一切經濟權、</p>
<p>（二）波蘭在但澤享受任何範圍之自由港、以完全保持海道交通、</p>
<p>（三）承諷德波邊界為最後疆界、</p>
<p>（四）與波蘭締結二十五年之互不侵犯條的、較余之生命更長、</p>
<p>（五）德波匈三國聯合保證斯洛伐克、以避免德國片面之獨覇、但波蘭政府拒絕之提議、僅表示（一）願談判但澤市國聯委員人選問題、（二）考慮在波蘭走廊之運輸便利、余對波蘭政府此種態度、深表遺憾、然而尙非決斷問題、最惡劣者、乃波蘭誤信國際運動倣傚一年前捷克之所為、動員部隊、欲以對付德國，於是有保證安全之提議、與夫互助公的之締結、今而後倘發生國際衝突、波蘭將進而攻擊德國矣、此與余在一九三四年與波蘭故大總統皮爾蘇斯基上將所締互不侵犯公約之精神、自然大相逕庭、故余認為德波互不侵犯公的、因波蘭之片面破壞、巳經不復存在矣、但余重言申明、如波蘭願意遵守上述原則與德國重行締結新的協定、以調整兩國間之關係、則余仍歡迎之不暇也、</p>

<p>希氏於是歷述德國之屈辱及經濟之破亡稱、「今日吾等巳知此種大戰殘酷結果之原因矣、一言以蔽之曰、毀滅他國、為達到此種目的起見、必須（一）剝奪德國之殖民地、（二）虐待民族、使不得起而反抗壓制者之蹂躪、（三）經濟鏈鎖、使德國百年不能償淸賠款、（四）最可恥者、解散德國民族分化其政治區域、余曾一再申明、如歐洲各國間不尊重民族自決之原則、不顧及政治經濟之需要、而望獲得調協之解決、乃極不可能之事，余更一再申明、雖修改凡爾賽和的亦尙不能盡滿人意、因足以引起爭執之領土、為數甚多、因此、余乃作最後決定、余並未若法國一八七零年至一八七一年之所為、宜佈亞爾藍斯洛倫兩省為不可容忍、但余將薩爾與此兩省、分別而論、自薩爾歸還德國之後、德法兩國在歐洲之領土問題、巳經解決、余並向若干歐洲國家發表有約束性之宣言此即荷蘭。比利時。瑞士丹麥、等國之答覆、均申明願守絕對中立、使德國政府深表同情及愉快、吾國與義大利之密切邦交、勿待贅述、而與匈牙利。南斯拉夫、亦有睦誼、希氏乃追述兼併奧地利、收復蘇台德區、成立波摩保護地、取回米美爾各事件之背景與動機、並提及分裂捷克前數日英法要求德國保障捷克之完整、而德國不願承允保障之故、蓋以當時中歐存儲大量之軍火、萬一誤用、燎原可危、例如捷克境內有飛機一千五百九十二架、高射砲五百零一尊、輕重機關槍二千一百七十五挺、步槍一百零九萬枝、槍彈十萬萬發、砲彈三百萬發、希氏於詳舉上述數字之後、慨然曰、德國處置此事、化解危險、究竟是功是過、得失如何、日後自知、母庸喋喋、目前可斷言者、英國對波希米亞及摩拉維亞無監視評議之權、猶之英國在此愛爾蘭境內之措施、不論是非得失如何、必不受德國之監視或評議也、</p>
<p>希氏復稱、余尤不解者、英國欲以慕尼黑協定拘束德國之行動是、張伯倫與予在慕尼黑成立之協定誠然涉及英德間之相互的關係、但若即認為今後德國在政治上之行動、皆可適用該協定以準繩之的束之、則膠柱鼓瑟、行而不通、猶謂英國欲在巴勒斯坦或他處有所措施、必須先與英國磋商可乎不可、張氏而今若認為慕尼黑協定業經廢除、吾人自可照辦、</p>
<h3>波蘭凖備與德談判說</h3>
<p>華沙波蘭各重要報紙、包含與外交部有關者在內、均紛紛刊載波蘭準備與德國討論但澤問題之報吿、此間外交界及政界方面表示驚奇、政治觀察家認為波蘭報紙在希特勒發表演說之時發表是項消息、殊屬重要、（二十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>華沙　據波蘭政府機關報衛索爾報載稱、波蘭現有武裝軍隊一百萬人、原有常備軍四十萬、四星期前又徵調後備軍六十萬、故現時兵力達一百萬云、（二十八日海通電）</p>
<h3>列舉各點駁復羅氏　拒絕宣佈未來政策</h3>
<p>希氏遂又回至羅斯福之電、稱「今日舉世之不安、完全由於國際鼓動戰爭者之作祟、其實自一九一九年至一九三八年之間、國際共發生戰爭十四决、其中任何一次德國均不與焉、同時期內、又有二十六决暴力干涉及武力流血制裁、德國亦絕未參與、而美國本身則曾參加六决軍事干涉、蘇俄參加戰爭干涉制裁共達十决、因此余認為羅氏所稱、「現時世界對於戰爭之恐懼、」並非由於實際之戰爭、而係由於報章惡意之宣傳、引起人造的恐怖、余相信、倘各國負責政府能的束該國報章、對於各國間之關係、及國外事件，慎重刊登、則戰爭恐怖、當可立即消除、此其一、羅氏相信、任何大戰必將引起嚴重悲慘之結果、其答覆為德人對此、認識最深、但余不相信任何戰爭將使全世界均有悲慘結果、除非全世界均締結公的、結成機體、捲入漩渦、此其二、至如羅氏所稱、渠曾向希特勒一再提出呼籲一節、則余亦會屢請以和平方法、解決國際問題、此其三、關於羅氏悲憫歐洲三國及非洲一國之喪失獨立一節、「余不知所謂歐洲喪失獨立之三國、係指誰何、須知此等國家、在一九一八年成立之時、完全違反民意、羅氏何竟昧於此項歷史上錯誤之史實乎、此其四、至羅氏所稱此决呼籲、完全為人類福利、大聲疾呼、則答之曰、「倘美國此種呼聲、發當其時、則德國不致受凡爾賽條的之害矣、此其五、羅氏以為國際問題、可以國際會議解決之、此則完全錯誤、國聯會二十年來、未能解決一種問題、其他國際會議、又何一非徒然具文、國際問題必須民族力量加以解決、非會議桌所能解決、此其六、關於羅氏所稱、會議成功、必須以雙方之善意為條件之說、可答之曰、德國將來永不參加任何類似法庭之國際會議、此其七、至於羅氏所謂余如發表關於德國未來政策之坦白申明、則於國際和平、大有裨益、可答之曰、余向德國人民外、不能對其他任何人、有所宣佈、此其八、且如德義兩國要求美國說明其對中南美外交政策、則美國又將如何、此其九至於羅氏所云、感受德國威脅之各小國、經德國詢問結果、各國均作反面答覆、此其十、關於羅氏對縮軍一事提出之詢問、希氏首先提出一九一九年至一九二三年之間、協的國委員會曾證明、德國已完全履行縮軍之條件、凡爾塞和的曾規定、世界各國一般縮軍、德國縮軍之行動已辦到、而他國反增加軍備、置德國之呼籲與建議於罔聞、至一九三四年德國乃不得不重整軍備矣、此其十一、關於羅氏對德國保證參加貿易討論之詢問、則答之曰、停止抵制購貨之騷動與取消貿易之障碍、乃先決之問題、此其十二、</p>
<p>希氏將羅斯福之詢問逐條答復後、對羅氏提出下列之建議請其履行威爾遜十四點、並恢復德國被竊之失地、希氏稱所謂一國之元首、對於人類之命運負有責任、余與羅氏自表同情、但德美兩國之財富與人口之密度、則大大不同、希氏以德國之福利為前提、而羅氏則可以全世界為前提、以美國擁有更大之原料與財產故也、</p>
<p>希氏之最後一語曰、余為德國之正義·福利·進步及和平努力、即為全人類之正義·福利·進步及和平努力云、（二十八日海通電）</p>
<h3>希特勒之演說　美不認為正式答復</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間外交界人士頃宣稱、羅斯福總統發出刪電之後、按之外交禮儀、德國元首希特勒當以電報作答、未可僅以發表演說了事、故在美國當局方面、對於希特勒元首本日之演說、旣未便認為答復、亦卽無須作何正式表示、迄目前為止、羅斯福總統不擬再二决電達希特勒元首、美國駐德大使威爾遜、亦無返任之議、必俟希特勒元首關於不侵略歐洲各國一事、明白作答之後、美國國務院始行考慮一切而有所決定云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞外長晤法總理</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　英羅兩國經濟談判、已在融洽環境中開始進行、據聞英國方面懷有三種意願、（一）資助羅國工業、俾以農立國之羅馬尼亞、不致淪為工業國如德國者之「殖民地」、（二）英國在羅國境內所保有之利益、務當予以保障、勿令羅德兩國關於鑛產森林煤油協定、妨碍羅國之獨立、（三）協助羅國、建造海港、俾在鐵道錢與多瑙河之外、獲有航海之便利、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）羅馬尼亞外交部長茄芬哥、本日午後與達拉第總理進行談話時、曾面致羅國國王加洛爾二世私函一通、內容略謂、法羅兩國關係、愈益密切、殊可慶幸、茄芬哥外長旋即由羅國大使達泰萊斯哥陪同晋謁勒勃倫總統、並於晚間與龐萊外長賡續談話、據負責方面所知、茄芬哥外長曾將渠與波·德·比·英四國當局談話經過、吿知法國各閣員、並向之證實、德國從未提出特殊要求、羅國依然保持行動之自由、至羅國與南斯拉夫國、邦交輯睦如故、初未因南國外長馬爾哥維區聘問義德兩國而受有何項影響、此在法國各閣員、則向茄芬哥外長再度聲明、羅國若被侵略、決當出兵相助、此與英國之援助該國相同、英法兩國且巳决定在經濟上儘量援助該國、俾其農產品不必仰頓德國為唯一出路、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）政府所提出之軍訓法案、下議院業以三七八票對一四五票之絕大多數、初讀通過、幷定於下月四日舉行二讀、張伯倫首相會在事前發表演說、籲請下議院務於今晚予以表決、略謂上月二十九日余雖提供諾言、聲明決不在承平時實施徵兵制，但目今時局實與當時情勢完全不同、吾國自向波蘭希臘羅馬尼亞各國接受約束之後、所負責任亦已大見增加、外間對於吾國有無履行的束之決心、旣已不無疑念、則實施國民軍訓自屬不容或緩、「緣吾國組織反侵略陣錢之努力、顯因此種疑念而受有妨礙、自須有以糾正之也」、至是首相乃涉及限制軍備工業利潤所擬採取之措置、略謂、「吾人斷不能一方面要求人民參加義務兵役、一方面聽仟他人乘機牟利、軍備工業合理的利潤、雖不願予以剝奪、但若聽其博取無限的利益、亦非一般人所能容忍、殷富階級所負担之捐稅雖已不少、他日若果發生戰事、尙須大事提高、彼時私人的財富、常視同首相詞畢，即由反對派工黨領袖阿德里少校·自由黨領袖辛克萊·相繼發表演說加以反對保守黨極右派領袖邱吉爾則加以贊成、最後乃由陸相倍立厦結束辯論、下議院討論結果、卒於否決工黨修正案之後、又以三七八票對一四五票之絕大多數、通過軍訓決案、茲將阿德里辛克萊邱吉爾倍立厦四人所發表之演說、摘要補誌於後、</p>
<p>（一）工黨領袖阿德里少校之言有曰、本黨準備為國家福利而有所犧牲、此與政府當局初無二致、但實施徵兵制則非本黨所能苟同、當此國家亟須精神團結之日、此舉旣不足以加强國力、反足以削弱之分化之、」抑他日若果發生戰事、英國除就海空兩軍多所努力而外、斷難倣照大陸國之規模、編成强大之陸軍、幷以軍火彈藥供給各同盟國、此　彰彰明湛、可見徵兵制實無其必要</p>
<p>（二）自由黨領袖羣克萊之言有　、他日發生戰事時、英國所　負之任務、不應低於其他各同盟國、英國陸軍部隊之派往大陸者、應有五十萬員名之多、益以五十萬員名之預備軍、則英國遠征軍可達至一百萬員名之多、凡此固為吾人所承認、但本黨以為志願服務制幷未盡量予以利用、即以政府所提出之軍訓法案而論、其對象僅為二十歲至二十一歲之靑年、而非全國壯丁、亦嫌事有未盡、</p>
<p>保守戴　右派領袖邱吉爾、對於軍訓法案完全加以贊同、略謂、反對徵兵制者若果佔上風、則歐洲各國抵抗國社主義之整個組織、勢必因之瓦解、但有一層須聲明者、余亦認為僅僅召集二十歲乃至二十一歲之青年入伍、實嫌事未有盡、政府似須採取其他適當之措置、以策萬全、至英國對於不國所接受之約束、實乃各民治國安全之基礎、</p>
<p>（四）陸相倍立廈於結束辯論時宣稱、吾國全部正規軍應有二二四·〇〇〇名、目下僅有二〇四·〇〇〇員名、一備軍應有三二五·〇〇〇員名、目下僅有一六七·〇〇〇名、至陸軍輔助隊、原定為九六·〇〇〇員名、目下僅有八〇·〇〇〇員名、其中以正規軍而論、依照現行編制、其員額已無從再加、至後備軍官兵均係有職業之國民、亦未便提高訓練時期、於以見實施國民軍訓、已屬刻不容緩、政府所由以二十歲至二十一歲之青年為對象、乃因此輩青年、大都在求學時代、使其暫時輟讀、尙無妨碍故也、全國共有二十至二十一歲青年三〇〇·〇〇〇名、其中三〇·〇〇〇名、業已參加正規軍或在輔助隊服務、似此軍訓實施之後、尙可召集二七〇·〇〇〇名云、（廿七哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>羅斯福氏斡旋經過</h3>
<p>（紐約）紐約泰晤士報派駐華盛頓名記者克勞克、頃在該報發表一文、敍述羅斯福總統斡旋歐洲時局經過情形、略謂、羅斯福總統前於去年五月至九月間歐洲時局一再危迫之際、曾派代表、向義國首相墨索里尼提出建議、並要求將所建議、轉吿德國元首希特勒、其內容乃邀的墨希二氏、各乘軍艦、至北大西洋中立國之島嶼、例如葡屬亞索爾羣島、與之會晤、蓋「羅斯福總統乃欲直接探悉、德義對於維持永久和平一層、究作何種最低限度之要求、藉稔能否居　幹旋」、據華盛頓方面所知、墨索里尼首相會將此項建議、轉達德國當局、乃遭婉辭謝絕、謂希特勒元首即使相信此項會談有成立協定之可能、但亦未便在此際離開歐洲一步云、此種經過、雖無從確知其時日、但「大致係在去歲九月間慕尼黑會議之前、亦即羅斯福總統直接向希特勒元首發電呼籲之前」、此事旣無成就、且無痕跡、當然為關係方面所吾認、但羅斯福總統對於歐洲時局絕無挑撥舉動、反之、且準備犧牲其政治前途、以維持歐洲和平、則均於此舉獲一明證」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日領訪工部局總董　請取締反日報紙</h3>
<p>局方不欲限制報紙自由</p>
<p>但如引起惡感將謀應付</p>
<p>字林報云、昨（廿七日）據透露、駐滬日總領事三浦、於星期三日午後、訪會工部局總董樊克令、要求立卽採取步驟、禁止公共租界中之反日宣傳與反日報紙、三浦當向樊克令面遞照會、據工部局某高級人員、該照會「措辭甚有禮、」內稱、公共租界中反日情感之爆發、允以華人所有之新聞紙為甚、日當局對之甚為不安、末請應悉數禁止公共租界中之反日宣傳與反日報紙、</p>
<p>局方研究照會內容</p>
<p>昨聞工部局議董刻正硏究該照會、並對業已接得之上海日常局前發備忘錄、加以考慮、但關於該照會、並未致覆文予日當局、昨據工部局某員語記者云、反日宜傳與報端反日情緖之爆發問題、樊克令與工部局議董考慮已久、彼等雖不欲限制報紙之自由、但對任何報紙之情緖爆發或宜傳、其將在上海引起不和或惡感者、責當採取行動、最近將來、即將考慮反對此種劇烈宣傳之行動、無論其反日與否云、</p>
<p>偽「市長」抗議目的</p>
<p>三浦之照會、係隨「上海市長」傅筱庵向法總領事鮑黛芝提出抗議而發、按傅之抗議、乃要求立刻採取步驟、逮捕四月十七日在法租界暗殺「上海巿府」前人員王憲明之兇手、並要求採取有效之適當步驟、逮捕並控制法租界中之政洽恐怖份子、俾防杜日後續起性質相類之罪案、又要求法租界警務當局應與「上海巿府」之警務人員合作、在法租界搜査政治恐怖份子、據聞法租界當局仍在考慮此項抗議、尙未致覆文於傅筱庵、而對傅前於二月十七日及三月十日所致照會、亦正在研究中、</p>
<p>警務處已發出警告</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（二十七日）聞諸可靠方面、公共租界中出版之華字日報除日方所有者外、其發行人與編輯人均巳接得警務處政治科之警吿、反對刊載「似將擾亂和平與秩序」之材料、且聞法租界當局頃亦取相類之步驟、日領事館當局上星期向工部局總董樊克令與此間各外國領事館、對其國民發行華字日報者、提出要求、警務處顯係隨此要求而發出警吿、</p>
<p>英領勸告報社注意</p>
<p>此間英總領事斐利浦近曾召集華字報紙之負責英籍發行人與編輯人、而向彼等建議合作、勿載警務處視為破壞性質之文字、聞美當局未取相類之步驟、警務處之警吿、乃為一般的性質、但切實聲明、為警務處以為華字日報違背一般的警吿、即將不問其所有人、而採取警務行動、至於將取何種行動、則未確切表示、</p>
<p>各方見解未盡相同</p>
<p>據此間某名律師聲稱、如扣留外商發行之報紙或恫嚇報販、或將惹起法律糾紛、蓋此種行動、將成為擴張警權至其權力範圍以外也、聞發行人均稱願與警務處竭力合作、但有若干表示彼等不能贊同遏制正當新聞、又對於無需向兩租界當局登記之書籍發行人與販賣人、亦已施加壓力近數星期來、警務處已有扣留書籍之舉、日籍探員常參與其間、被扣書籍中、有華美出版公司發行范士柏所著「日本的間諜」一書之中譯本、</p>
<h3>寗波市區被炸　人心極為鎭定</h3>
<p>靈橋兩堍投彈十七枚</p>
<p>死傷百餘人兩岸大火</p>
<p>靈橋是否炸燬待續報</p>
<p>寗波於昨日上午九時許、突有日機五架、沿海飛來、防空部立鳴警報、市民紛紛奔避、該日機飛抵靈橋門附近上空、盤旋數匝後、卽向半邊街宮後街一帶、先後投彈十七枚逸去、該兩處房屋、立起大火、市民死傷百餘人、救護隊立卽出動、奮勇救護、傍晚火勢漸滅、死傷者分別收殮救治、人心鎮定、地方秩序亦佳、</p>
<p>被炸情形相當嚴重</p>
<p>據航業界消息、二十六日晨、日機三架空襲、在鎭海口招商碼頭投彈五六枚、圖炸老太平橋、但多落江心、故無甚損害、詎昨午本市德商禮和洋行船務部又接甬分公司電吿云、「今晨日機五架襲甬、在靈橋兩堍、投彈十七枚、傷人頗多、房屋焚燒、發電時、火尙未熄、詳情續吿、十一點發、」該行於下午五時許、續接甬分公司電、（上略）日機七架、上午八時半在甬靈橋一帶大肆轟炸、死傷人數的在百餘人以上、大火至三時餘、尙未停止、江東後塘街及天后宮至靈橋小菜塲止一帶房屋均被災、四時發、」</p>
<p>旅滬甬人異常關切</p>
<p>上項電吿到滬後、一般旅滬甬人聞訊、因事關桑梓安寗、故均關切異常、紛紛向同鄕會等各關係方面探詢、尤以靈橋之是吾被毀為念、據現代社記者探悉、靈橋即係老江橋、民國二十四年時、由旅滬甬紳金廷蓀·張繼光·孫梅堂·袁履登·劉鴻生·徐懋堂·方椒伯·等發起、集資七十萬元、重行改建、全部以水泥鋼骨構成、工程極為偉大、於二十五年五月落成、該項橋樑、純係便利甬城車輛交通、並壯市容觀瞻、在軍事上無絲毫意義、靈橋之東境為江東街、西堍則為鹹河頭、（即半邊街）該處商肆林立、市　繁盛、故此决遭日機轟炸、死傷定較衆多、但寗波純為不設防城市、日機之濫行轟炸、徒然殘殺無辜而已、又據大通社云、寗波轉播到滬消息、靈橋未被炸、日機在甬投彈後、即向鎭海逸去、</p>
<h3>甌江關員　奉令撤退</h3>
<p>擬由明和輪載滬</p>
<p>正考慮安全問題</p>
<p>浙東之溫州甌海關關員、奉令撒退、與停泊在溫之葡商萬國航務公司明和輪接洽、擬由該輪專載關員駛滬、該輪船亦已電滬向公司請示、滬公司因日方濫扣葡輪、故正考慮明和駛滬之安全問題、所以明和輪何日啟椗駛滬、須得滬公司考慮後决定、</p>
<h3>日艦非法封鎖後之航業　英國最受影響</h3>
<p>各國航業均見衰退</p>
<p>再不競爭將遭淘汰</p>
<p>開放長江仍遙遙無期</p>
<p>日艦自封鎖中國沿海各口岸、拒絕開放長江珠江、阻撓各國商輪行駛、任意檢査扣留故意為難、企圖獨覇各地航業、同時竭力擴充在華航綫、於是英美法德各國對華航業、均受影響、異常衰落、而日本突見起色、商輪出入、躍登首位、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>各國航業</p>
<p>今年第一季各國對華之商輪出入數目、日本一千五百四十五隻、二百五十二萬六千三百八十七噸、英國八百二十六隻、二百三十四萬四千七百六十七噸、瑙威二百四十四隻、五十一萬九千五百十四噸、德國八十隻、四十萬零九千零十六噸、荷蘭五十三隻、二十四萬二千三百二十九噸、法國三十一隻、十九萬七千六百二十九噸、美國二十六隻、十五萬零三百二十五噸、意國二十九隻、十四萬二千八百九十二噸、丹麥六十隻、十六萬五千六百二十八噸、瑞典十三隻、四萬五千零三十二噸、希臘七隻、二萬三千零三十九噸、巴拿馬八隻、一萬三千六百八十二噸、葡萄牙一百七十隻、七千四百零六噸、</p>

<p>各國對華航業向以英國佔第一位、去年八月為一百十二萬八千零三十七噸、九月為一百二十一萬九千二百五十噸、十月為九十二萬二千一百五十四噸、十一月為八十七萬二千五百四十六噸、十二月為八十一萬四千零七十九噸、今年一月為八十四萬零三百零二噸、二月為七十一萬三千四百零八噸、三月為七十九萬一千零五十七噸、則足證英國對華航業遂漸衰落、並由向佔第一位退至第二位、而日木反躍登第一位取而代之、如今年一月為七十五萬九千八百八十九噸（第二位）、二月為八十三萬二千一百四十九噸（第一位）、三月為九十三萬四千三百四十九噸（第一位）、</p>
<p>企圖獨覇</p>
<p>航業與貿易有休戚相關、航業之盛衰、即為貿易盛衰、今日本為欲使日貨傾銷其佔領區域、實行其經濟侵略政策、統制共佔領區域之貿易、排擠各國貨物輸入、同時藉口軍事關係、阻撓各國在華航行、竭力擴充在華之日木航業、如强迫沒收華輪、新闢各地新航綫、日輪有優先權搭客載貨、於是日本在華航業、自本年二月份起、竟躍登首位、船隻噸位逐月增加、並利用其特殊之勢力、對各國商輪駛入非淪陷區域、竟非法予以阻止、所以英法各國如不努力競爭、則此後之在華航業、將為日木所獨覇刦奪、</p>

<p>南橋日軍、經游擊隊連日分三路進攻、猶圖頑抗、戰事激烈、游擊隊前仆後繼銳不可當、肉搏衝鋒達十餘决、雙方傷亡極重、結果日軍不支、紛紛奪圍潰退、游擊隊跟踪追殺、擊斃日軍四十餘名、落浦溺斃者二十餘名、該鎮遂於昨日、復為游擊隊收復、並奪獲日軍輜重甚夥、日軍經游擊隊此决嚴重打擊後、將潰不成軍、</p>
<p>虹口日軍架高射砲</p>
<p>虹口近日謠諑甚熾、有謂華方空軍將飛臨大上海轟炸日軍者、或謂華方便衣隊絡繹潛入活動、巳有數百者、日方極為惴惴不安、昨復在境內添架高射砲、以防華機轟炸、</p>

<h3>日偽企圖獨覇　內地春繭市塲</h3>
<p>苛訂條例限制採購</p>
<p>本市各廠準備交涉</p>
<p>現値春汛將屆、日偽為企圖獨佔內地絲巿、使華洋廠商無法問津起見、特將去年秋繭汛時所訂定之「條例」復重行修改、凡民間所產之絲繭、須先經過「省」「縣」設立之收繭「機關」交易、不得直接買賣、如廠客採辦、亦須先報購數額、付給保證金、不得直接向民間採辦、現日偽已在浙省之杭（州）嘉（興）湖（吳興）、蘇省之崑（山）錫（無錫）蘇（吳縣）常（熟）等各縣產地、設立收繭「機關」、任意壓低市價、但杭嘉等處係屬蠶絲之發源地、民間均自備烘灶、可隨時繅製、不願被日偽剝削、惟蘇常各地、因無此項設備、不能久儲、故犧牲甚鉅、</p>
<p>採辦困難各廠焦慮</p>
<p>本巿各華商繅絲廠、及駐滬經銷洋莊、以春繭登塲在即、派員分赴各產地詳細調查、並探聞日偽方面對繭收辦法、業巳陸續返滬報吿、各廠對日偽變更收繭、重訂「條例」、頗為焦慮、本擬赴鄕設莊收買、現因此而延擱、各華洋廠莊、正在進行聯合商洽中、俾商討妥善辦法、向日偽交涉、</p>
<p>海外市場華絲活躍</p>
<p>歐美絲銷市塲、自我國抗戰以還、國際人士、對我同情、久被日本侵奪之海外絲市、因遭各國抵制影響、華絲異常活躍自去年八月迄今、每月由上海江海關報裝至歐美者、比較以往一二年前、增加百分之三十以上、但本週則因國外存貨豐足、銷胃稍見减少、</p>
<h3>帮辦總巡被毆案　即將提出抗議</h3>
<p>李里返輪取烟斗</p>
<p>歸途竟肇此鉅禍</p>
<p>西捕及李里夫人傷勢好轉</p>
<p>字林報云、公共租界警務處帮辦總巡桑森、四月廿四日晚、在公濟醫院招待廳中被日本海軍特別陸戰隊某少佐毆擊事件、工部局總辦、已於星期三日晚接得詳報、並附有目擊者之報吿書、昨日由工部局議董加以硏究、預料不久將向日當局</p>
<p>提出抗議、按此事係雷士德工業學校校長李里在百老滙路撞車殞生、李里夫人與警務處西捕頭維姆寒特舁入公濟醫院之後發生、昨（廿七日）聞維氏夜臥安適、體况尙可滿意、李里夫人亦大見好轉、惟均在不能加以詢問之狀態中、又上海泰晤士報云、星期一日晚百老滙路撞車案、</p>
<p>續加調查後、已確定下列事實、李里於午後自格納新諾號輪登陸、返寓後發覺其烟斗遺忘輪上房艙中、是晚即由李里夫人為伴、駕汽車返泊於虹口碼頭旁之輪上、返市時、在百老滙橋撞及障碍物、未曾停下、但繼續前駛時、李里及其夫人均以為莫如駛返該橋、</p>
<p>消除誤會免使人起彼等應停車而故意不停之印象為佳、彼等作此決定時、已駛過外白渡橋、見值崗之西捕頭維姆塞特、即向之言明此事、維氏亦以為駛返為佳、乃入車伴同前往、迨抵百老匯橋、與該處戰隊哨兵交談頗久、經若干時間後、李里認為不必再事逗留、乃</p>
<p>驅車而行但日哨兵一名、認為此事未滿意解決、亦登該車之踏板上、竟對駕駛者加以阻撓、駕車遂圖使哨兵下車、必曾歪斜行駛、於公共汽車轉灣時、兩車遂猛然相撞、</p>

<h3>名人訪問　虞洽卿先生　服務社會的精神</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>生平服膺忠信勤儉四字</p>
<p>數十年奮鬥為中外折服</p>
<p>舊聞新抄均上海之掌故</p>
<p>辦勸業會</p>
<p>我國自遜淸道光二十二年五口通商後，對外貿易日衰，舶來之品日多，金錢外溢，不可數計，本人心實憂之，默念求國富之道，莫如發達商業，應開勸業會，為之提倡。於是遍向當道及工商家廣為宣傳，當是時兩江總督端方為滿員中思想較為新穎者，力贊其說，惟經費籌措為難，於是本人首墊銀三十六萬，度支部撥銀七十萬，會址勘定南京鼓樓，開始與築會塲及各省陳列館，並建輕便鐵路，溝通會塲與下關之交通，端方為會長，本人副之，正在積極進行之際，端方忽調北洋，本人甚為憂慮，以當時官塲情形，實為人存政存人亡政息，端方一去，勢必功敗垂成，乃急與端方磋商，吿以事經奏准，斷無中輟之理，會期三月，各省出品，靡不畢集，到會者的二十萬人，惟本人發起勸業會，意在利用會期，使各省英俊及南洋僑胞得以暢叙一堂，藉、以交換意見，聯絡感情，不料繼端方者為張人駿，雖礙於旨准，不敢公然反對，然處處與本人為雞，後勸業會於千艱萬難中始吿成也。</p>
<p>五卅慘案</p>
<p>民國十四年五月三十日下午二時左右，上海公共租界南京路老閘捕房前發生巡捕槍殺學生工人事件，發彈四十四響，由捕頭愛活生命令開槍，一時死傷纍纍，繼以罷工罷學，損失之鉅，不可計及。惟是罷工範圍旣大，救濟費用益鉅，雖有國內外踴躍輸將，仍有捉襟見肘之歎。本人時為上海總商會會長，身當其衝，環顧內外形勢，幾有無以為繼之慮，焦頭爛額，以籌應付，而後嚴重形勢，漸趨緩和。</p>
<p>加入華董</p>
<p>參與公共租界市政問題，本人會於淸光緒三十二年二月間致函工部局總董提議設一華人代表委員會，蓋以為租界市政華人無參與之權，殊失公平待遇之道，允與同治五年領事團之提議與是年十二月工部局總董所公佈之意見相背。旋工部局增加市政總捐由一二至一四之舉，界內居民，奮起組織各馬路聯合會，並為參加巿政實行起見，設置納稅華人會，以與納稅外人會立於平等地位。交涉結果，加入顧問委員五人，五顧問後以五卅慘案辭職，當時大部份外人，亦漸明瞭租界市政非中外合作不可。乃於民國十五年由工部局請求有關係之外交當局，與我國政府協商批准加入華董三人於工部局，其職權與外董一律。民國十六年，兩租界有增加市政總捐二厘之舉，反對之聲浪蜂起，法租界先行和平解決，而公共租界方面市政當局未澈底明瞭華人意思，對於不付增捐者，輒阻止其營業，因之閉門者，有四十一家之多。本人以北伐正在進展，全國尙未統一，為顧全大局與界內治安計，出為調停，定所增總捐名為額外，抗議繳付，同時以加入華董五人與委員六人為過渡，並口頭的定於决年即增加華董。乃工部局方面迫於情勢，未能即向有關係當局建議，繼二年之努力，於民國十九年五月二日始收取圓滿之功。</p>
<p>記者復憶及公共租界中外各界為紀念虞氏對租界公共福利事業之功績起見，曾將租界內橫亘南北之西藏路，改名為虞洽卿路。此舉實為紀念虞氏之永久口碑，虞氏對此謙遜不邊，謂人生以服務為目的，初何足道。嗣承檢出民國二十五年十月一日虞洽卿路命名典禮慶祝大會時之照相一幀，為外間所未覩、用為刋出、以見虞氏之盛德，自在人心也。</p>
<p>暢談至此，時往訪虞氏待商救濟事宜者，巳有多人，記者乃道謝而別。（完）</p>

<p>受其騙者不知凡幾、近更至金隆街二十號楊鼎源棉花廠主楊雪樵處、指楊曾充任七寳鎮「維持會會長」、圖詐四千金、經楊報吿中央捕房、由華探長王程應·蔣上佩·楊培生等將祁等六名拘獲、解由特一法院訊押、各情巳誌本報、昨晨此案由馮世德推事開刑</p>
<p>一庭續訊楊雪樵亦延李渭濱律師到庭投遞訴狀、對於被吿等指其當事人為七寳鎭「維持會會長」一點、加以答辯、謂楊於戰後即逃往角里甚久、後即來上海、從未參加任何偽組織作賣國行為、且楊素屬正當商人、曾担任七實鎭商會會長、絕不願</p>
<p>為虎作倀以辱國辱民、故應加以說明云云、繼由捕房律師汝葆　聲稱、本案因被吿犯案衆多、一時尙難查明、故請求准予再行延期、容詳查明晰後合併訴究云云、旋經庭上傳訊代被吿等刻圖意之沙錦棠、及代印信件之陳鑑明到案、經二人證明</p>
<p>圖章信函係由彭江天朱紹良委託代辦當時不疑虛偽、故為代刻代印等詞、被吿律師范剛兪恩良向庭上請准被吿交保、馮推事以情節重大、暫難照准、乃論令改期特別訂訊、</p>

<h3>外交手腕的巧拙</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>在最近這一個階段上，國際外交手腕的巧拙，很可以得到一個淸楚的比較。</p>
<p>先從羅斯福向希特勒和墨索里尼的詢問說起。這詢問當然也可以歸入外交的範圍內。可是牠並沒有經過平常外交的途徑，由專負外交之責的官員，身任其事，却以一國的元首，直接詢問另一國的元首。這是外交上的新紀錄，而且態度光明，意義嚴正，也非一般的外交辭令所可比擬，因此牠的價値超出了一般的外交方式，我們就不能用巧拙來批評牠。</p>
<p>然而接着這一聲巨雷而來的種種，在國際外交上的反響，我們却可以肆其月旦了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼的反響是拙的。他發表了一篇演說，對羅斯福作了空洞不着邊際的答覆，誰都看得出他的理屈辭窮來。有人說，因爲他明知不是重要的脚色，所以落得如此敷衍過去，壓軸戲還要給希特勒唱，也許是對的吧。</p>
<p>希特勒的反響是巧的。他不直接答覆，也不急於發表演說，却挖空心思，想出轉向各小國詢問，有否受着德國的威脅。這一來，他不但可以遜延答覆的時日，而且可以藉着意想中於己有利的各小國的答覆，來和羅斯福胡扯，不致見窘。可是他這一個方式，國際與論已一致加以嘲笑了，雖巧也是扯吧。</p>
<p>各小國的答覆希特勒，當然也是不能論其巧拙的，因爲誠如一般人所說，平民在暴徒的槍口下，小學生在頑童的脅逼下，木來巳沒有答覆的自由，所以她們的答覆雖然是拙劣無比，我們也只可以存而不論。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的答覆，那就最爲巧妙了！她說，羅國的有吾受到德國威脅，羅國不自知，還當問諸德國自己。「以子之矛，陷子之盾；」「即以共人之道，還治共人之身：」「請君入甕，」這些成語，都可以移附羅團的外交當局。不過有人說羅國的語妙天下，是有恃而無恐所促成的：吾則恐怕也只是「秀才遇着兵，有理講不淸」而已。</p>
<p>英國駐德大使漢特森的返任，可以說是外交手腕中最拙劣的一種。這話我已說過，茲不再論。而德國政府的對付漢特森，又可以說是拙中之巧。牠爲了漢特森的先事宜傳，就乾脆與以不見，是拙的；可是使漢特森無所施其伎，不能自閱其說，她佔了勝利，是巧的。</p>
<p>外交固然要以武力爲後盾，可是巧妙的外交，其成功往往可超出武力，所謂「不出樽俎之間，而折衝千里之外」的便是。今之政府常局，似乎仍該注意外交才是吧。</p>
<h3>流動者</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>是一個滿天飛沙的傍晚，到了我們的目的地，江蘇西北碭山縣。</p>
<p>沉長的鐵的一羣，蜿蜒地向前挺進，暮色中蠕動着幾千顆人影，踏着鬆軟如粉的泥土；一個影子挨着一個影子，連桔成一條無窮的鐵的長城，在望不見的一方，隱藏了鐵的尾巴。</p>
<p>爲了縮小目標起見，這鐵的洪流，就流向每個村落裹，散播在能相互呼應的各處。</p>
<p>我是某一部的工作人員，我們共有二十幾人，在離碭山城二里許的一個鄉村中鷄莊，找到了安息的地方。初步的工作，就在這個古老而誠樸的鄕村中開展。</p>
<p>老百姓對於灰色的影子，並不投視驚駭的眼光，却從每個樸實的臉上，流露出興奮的情緒；即使老年人，也會扶着拐杖走來，像對着自己兒子一樣熱情地慰問。他們所蘊藏的是一顆喜悅的心，這從每個淸晰急促的呼吸中可以意味到。</p>
<p>消息的傳播，在鄉村中相當靈敏，我們到達他們的村上沒有牛小時，塲上擁滿了幾十個天眞的孩子，那都是學齡的兒童。每個孩子都昂起着頭，睜着眼，一霎一霎；他們沒有聲響，注意着，傾聽着，我們這一羣每一個陌生的動作，每一句陌生的言語，像在敎室中聽先生講演童話時一樣的集中注意。這裏我們在審視着他們每一個可愛的臉龐，在我們的印象裏是如何的深刻啊。</p>
<p>我們開始用國語拉雜地談起來。他們對於我們的換了一種語言，似乎覺得有些奇怪，但不費力的聽懂了我們的話，都迅速地把自己的身體隨便的換了一個姿勢。臉部在微弱的星光中，隱的地看出在發紅，眼珠子在閃鑠着晶瑩的光，更顯得分外的興奮；他們爭先回答我們所發的問題。</p>
<p>沒有陌生，沒有畏縮，我們之間親近得像久別重逢的弟兄。</p>
<p>他們吿訴我們現在還在離這裏不到二里路的鄉村小學中讀書，他們並不因砲聲的威脅而動搖他們的決心。他們吿訴了我們各人的名字，較大的孩子更說出了這决抗戰的淺明意義，這是從他們會聽得先生說過的記憶里找索出來的。</p>
<p>我們於是提出了幾曲一般人都熟了的歌，請他們同我們合唱；他們懂得簡單的輪唱，更懂得看我手的動作，來決定聲音的高低和快慢。</p>
<p>尖銳的歌聲，繞遍了這個冷靜的村落。</p>
<p>小孩子，大孩子，男人，女人流成了廣大的人海。大人們是想來呌孩子吃晚飯的，但給歌聲吸住了，沒有說出他的話，孩子們更忘記了肚子在飢荒。雄壯的歌聲，傳遍了四野，打入了每個人的心底深處。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>世紀底新生</h3>
<p>— 石風</p>
<p>一，</p>
<p>末日</p>
<p>來臨吧；</p>
<p>那腐朽了的</p>
<p>舊世界的屍骸</p>
<p>正在向你招手！</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>在亞洲，</p>
<p>一個躑躅的巨人</p>
<p>站起來了！</p>
<p>挺豎於高山之巓，</p>
<p>像古之聖者，</p>
<p>凛然地</p>
<p>兀立着！</p>
<p>三，</p>
<p>狂風捲旋着！</p>
<p>暴雨衝出着！</p>
<p>孕育在光和熱的交奏里，</p>
<p>世紀又賦了新的生命</p>
<h3>的三階段</h3>
<h3>第一次出動</h3>
<p>— 任林瑞</p>
<p>初秋，天氣還是很熱，大地培養長大的棉花，肥白的花，早被當地的農人摘去，當作他們極値得重視的一年之中辛勞的酬報，祇剩下枯枝，又雜的遍布在這荒凉的田野。</p>
<p>沒有山，然而却有着土堆的墳墩，它凸出在田野里，好像爲大田管理一切。</p>
<p>不寬闊的小河却有好幾條，它可以引波你到此地著名的唐家祠堂，它也可以引渡你到岸旁，廣大陰暗深綠的竹林中去。現在白天，時常在這裏可以看見駐防着的士兵，他們會向你招手，駕着尖頭的峭船，很輕鬆的划着單櫓。</p>
<p>公立第二傷兵醫院是設在鄉下的一個公立小學校里，裹邊也有從上海紅十字會派去救護隊在服務，醫院中極靜，傷兵所蓋的被褥大都是老百姓所親自送來的。</p>
<p>我們時常到這醫院去，因爲童子軍也要做救護工作的。抬傷兵的時候路很難走，全要從田地間狹小的道旁走過，但是我們走不慣，於是終沿着小河的岸旁走。小河是美麗的，小河是我們的指南針。</p>
<p>田野里祇有公立醫院附近有二十多間鄕屋，都是古老陳舊的，這是此地唯一的房舍了，我們有幾位同志是住在那邊。</p>
<p>晚，已經顯得很凉，月亮照在田野上，望過去，燈火，都沒有一點，祇有月亮的銀灰色，範罩這田野。</p>
<p>我和老顧——他年歲比我大，個子也比我高；一同去站崗，他帶着步槍，還背了幾排的子彈。</p>
<p>雖然覺得有點凉意，但是這種職使是我們願意接受的，我們周巡着田野。</p>
<p>前面有兩憫壯丁，答覆了我們——當夜的口令，馬上就急忙的跑過來，吿訴我們；前面墳墩後面好像有人在放信號，綠的熖允，很快的朝天空放。</p>
<p>我就從老顧手中拿來支槍刺；很快的左右四人分散包圍這具有危險性的墳墩，我心中有點躊躇，有點害怕。然而捉人呵！我踏着靑草，很快的兜了過去。</p>
<p>「沒有！」我們跑了個圈子遭遇着的時候，都發出同樣的奇聲。</p>
<p>打發壯丁走後，我們帶着驚戒的心，躱避在附近，槍頭瞄準着剛才的墳頭。</p>
<p>凉夜是沉寂的，這里祇有我們兩人的呼吸。</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>來稿養賣獻金，本刊極爲贊同，請在稿末註明，即當照辦。這也許正是孤島文人報國的一途吧，請諸君踴躍參加爲盼。</p>
<h3>學拉</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>往而不來，非禮也；於是：推而不拉，非利也。而且推，都是防患於未然，去患於旣然的消極作用，不像拉，凡是於己有利的都拉，才是十足道地的積極作用。所以拉的對於推，本來等於狼的，對於狽，不可分離，而且還有獨立的價値，允其不可不學！</p>
<p>拉中第一手，自然要算拉人。例如想做官，就要學拉攏；拉攏的子目如：請吃，請逛，請玩；拜老師；攀親家，攀乾親家；認同鄕，認同學，認世誼；送東西；上轅門請安；大老婆，小老婆，姊妹，或仟何女人，走內線；……每項仔細硏究起來，足可成一專書；天下無難事，只怕有心人，此處表過不提。</p>
<p>想發財，就要學拉董事。因爲發財之道，最便捷的，除了做官，就要算打公司，開商店組織工廠，這些門路，只要你能够拉得到有財有聲望的第一等董事，有財無聲望的第二等董事，無財有聲望的第三等董事，他們舉你做經理，開了分公司，分店，分廠，做總經理，你就可以大發其財了。公司等發達，確有贏利，當然你可以大發財；不發達，甚至蝕本，更甚至倒閉，你一樣可以大發達，蓋渾水裏撈魚，由來是薪傳秘法，而股東倒完，經理或總經理吃飽，亦一定之公式也。</p>
<p>拉董事之外，自然拉股東也要緊。但是有了上面足以號召的董事，股東也就會聞風響應，不成問題了。</p>
<p>如果你說，董事是由股東選舉出來的，如何可以拉，則我要對你說：蠢哉孺子不可敎也，還須力學才是！蓋選舉是具文，拉是實！</p>
<p>最近，發財之道，除了開公司等以外，有種人異想天開，以爲開學校的出息也很不差，因此關於開學校的拉，也不能不努力一學。</p>
<p>第一，也要會拉董事；董事的資格正和公司等所有的一樣。第二，要會拉敎員：能够呌座，吸得牢學生的紅敎員要拉；能够刻苦耐勞，惠而不費，帮我發財而父潔已奉公，不思染指的黑敎員尤其要拉。第三，要會拉學生：來者不拒，多多益善爲宗旨；敝校三十六門，門門俱全，適應學生種種需要爲號召；或登報，或貼招子，或發傳單，甚至或請跑街，或用掮客爲手段。</p>
<p>據說，校長是文化界領袖，在我們這個右文之國，名譽比了經理或總經理還要好聽些，而發財則至少和經理或總經理差不多，似乎在名利雙收這一點上，校長之拉，比了經理或總經理之拉，允其要學得精明才是。</p>
<p>拉中第二手，也許要算拉功了吧。這一拉，正和推相反。</p>
<p>小而言之：和人家賽足球，贏了回來，囂囂然號於衆日：幸虧我那一脚，曾定了江山；老兄撒屎不帶草紙，若非我身有廢紙，方便爲門，賙濟於你，你就立不起身來；……甚至燒湯的保兒，也會來上一齣「丑表功」。大而言之：下級小職員，以及工人出店，辛苦奮鬬，不遺餘力，一朝發財，分起紅利來，按十七股開拆，所得爲一股的幾分之幾，而經理或總經理，則獨得幾股；白袍小將火頭軍，攻城略地，斬將搴旗，一概由張士貴上在狗婿何宗憲的賬上；……甚至堂堂一國的元首，以壓榨國民爲常事，以欺侮弱小爲能事，而發表演說時，則目稱爲國民的救主，和平的保護神。總之，「一切倒霉，吃虧，受損失的壞事，都推在別人身上，」而一切順利，繫華，增高名譽，地位，以及收入的好事，都拉在目己身上。</p>
<p>一拉冉拉，似乎還須「三拉」才會一團圖。」然而要學三拉，實在還太多，既不止三拉，也就越出了團圓的圈兒外，現在只好略提幾種，以成蛇是。</p>
<p>有拉稿當編輯的人，不能不學會這一手：稿荒會有稿，稿劣會有佳稿。大概沒有錢時，只有打躬作揖，巧取豪驟；有錢時，則挹彼注此，或薄彼厚此。彼者，後生小子，美其名曰新進作家；此者，老牌文匠，美其名曰文壇先進。</p>
<p>有拉檯子，在上海灘上走走的人，不能不學這一手：——</p>
<p>有拉客，常妓女的人——</p>
<p>罷了，再拉下去，就要拉得不成樣子了。就此打住，不再拉。</p>

<h3>中日外交與高麗</h3>
<p>（見　淸同治十一年四月份本報）</p>
<p>日本欲中國互相協助，中國因曾與高麗立約，如彼遇別國來攻，中國必用兵協助。旣有彼的在前，此的礙難成立。日本聞此消息，即發欽差與高麗國駐上海領事，馳赴北京，再議立的。日本欲立此的，極爲巧妙，緣其自知與高麗不睦，將至啟　，倘得中國兵力動助，必能取勝也。</p>

<h3>我們要求褚民誼先生來演講</h3>
<p>自從蔣委員長發動精神總動員以來，全國各地都響應了，各部門都積極展開　工作，在報紙上，在雜誌上，大家都在討論精神　動員的實施辦法，大家都在述說精神總動員的重要。精神總動員　經開始被認爲普遍的重要工作了。</p>
<p>我們是學生，是國民中的重要一部分，自然我們也應該耍做，並且很積極的做。</p>
<p>是星期五，我們學生自治會幹事會爲耍實施精神總動員，特地召集一次代表大會，我們請我們的校長與訓育主任來指導。</p>
<p>開會了，主席報告開會的會義，說明精神總動員的重耍，並問同學耍不要組織精神總動委員會。</p>
<p>「精神總動員是我們最高領袖發動的，全國國民都須實行，所以我們應該無疑的執行起來，用不到付表決！」這是我們校長先生的話，果敢的，英勇的，準確的。</p>
<p>其次，我們提到戰時敎育，因爲這是很重要的，全國第三决敎育會議中會嚴格討論過，計劃過：要在抗戰時期學習抗戰的技能，認識抗戰的理論。</p>
<p>「是的，這是重要的問題，並且我覺得抗戰敎育不但戰時重要，平時也應準備；我想關於目前的問題，國文可以讀點民族英雄的故事，以及全國領袖們的言論，公民可以多講點時事。」是訓育主任說話了。他是完全同意我們的提議，同時校長扣講同學多買點參考書以作補充材料。</p>
<p>「關於戰時敎育，我有點意見，就是希望各級的各科先生能有經常的聚會，在這聚會中學生自治會可派同學參加，在那裏他們經常的討論怎樣使他所敎的課本和抗戰配合起來，怎樣的敎授法才適合抗戰？我想這樣對於抗戰敎育的實施，一定更有帮助，更有把握。」這是高一同學的意見，這意見提得很好，校長訓育主任都答應了，同學也贊成。</p>
<p>以後，我們爲了要澈底的實行精神總動員，爲了眞正的愛護我們的學校，我們提出關於我們的董事長褚民誼先生的問題。因爲褚先生是在精衛的親戚，過去又是在精衛的秘書，所以在在精衛叛國叛民族之後，褚先生就大大的被人注意起來，而外界對我校的謠言也隨之加多。</p>
<p>這問題立刻展開了熱烈的討論，有的主張請他登報聲明，有的主張請他到學校來演講，有的主張去問董事，有的……我們討論的結論是：首先請校長寫信給褚先生，請他的一個日子，我們同學要去訪問他一次，爲着愛護我們有三十七年光榮歷史的學校，愛護我們的董事長，也爲了我們自己，在這决訪問中我們請求褚先生登報聲明表明態度，讓同學對他有更深一層的了解，和信仰；其决請褚先生來校演講一决，關於國民精神總動員或是關於在精衛，我們相信，褚先生是不會不答應的。</p>
<p>提議就在這熱烈的先生同意，學生贊成中通過了。同時代表會也到此結束。</p>
<p>這是前星期的事，這星期我們精神總勵員委員會要開成立會了，並定五月×日我們全體同學要宣誓，並且在那天學校答應請褚先生來演講並領導宜誓。</p>
<p>我們學校裏的精神總動員就這樣做起來了，但他的所以能够做得好，一大半的原因還是因爲得到了校長和訓育主任的帮助。</p>
<p>我們希望各校同學也都來發動精神總動員，並且希望各校的校長和訓育主任也能够像我們的學校裹的一樣，積極的帮助學生！</p>

<h3>「雙鎗將」觀感</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“The　Oklahoma　Kld”</p>
<p>華納公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>「一身是膽」的轟動一時，造成了美國電影競攝G-Man的新路綫，而詹姆士賈克奈道名字也大有和愛德華魯賓遜並駕齊驅之概了。但是從「一身是膽」之後，幾乎沒有一張更好的電影出來，這與其說是盛名之下，難乎爲繼，還不如說投機取巧，終於耍遭受失敗的結果的。幾個月前，聽說詹姆士賈克奈有一張超越「一身是膽」的新作來滬，譯名是「一世之雄」，但是直到現在，不能和我們相見。如果我沒有猜錯的話，那一定是殺人放火的央雄主義太可怕的緣故。現在的「雙鎗將一呢，還是一貫過去的作風，並沒有什麽特殊的成績</p>
<p>故事是叙述一八九三年美政府開放粵克拉賀瑪州的時候，有的翰金凱德和其子尼德，亦爲移民的一份子，但是當他們到達認領的土地，巳被著名賭徒麥克考特（亨茀萊鮑嘉）先到而佔領其地。的翰爲息事寗人計，不願與之興訟，而努力經營，將此一片荒涼之地，漸趨繁榮。居民感的翰之德，擬舉之爲市長。賭徒恐的翰一旦握得政權，於己不利，乃陷的翰殺人之嫌，下於獄，並綁架法官，唆使手下處的翰以死刑。詹姆士賈克奈是飾終年流浪在外的的翰子，他爲了報父仇，獨除三害。</p>
<p>這自然又是英雄主義十足的一部電影，當他除三害的時候，手持雙鎗，馬到成功，但是最後當他和麥克考特格鬥，終於由他哥哥尼德的發鎗，帮助他成功。這里，劇作者太忽略了合作的重要，和羣衆的力量。羣衆旣在麥克考特的煽惑之下置的翰於死地，那末當正義之前，他們一定更有力地去剷除惡勢力的陰謀的。所以，當詹姆士勸的翰越獄的時候，他是力持正義必伸的。</p>
<p>尼德的女友琪恩（露絲曼麗蘭）終於和詹姆士結爲夫婦，這羅曼斯的穿挿，我覺得也是勉强得很。</p>
<p>本片的攝影師是黃宗沾，移民車馬出發的時候，用多樣的角度攝取馬蹄和車輪是很好的，畫面也漂亮。</p>
<h3>服務精神？</h3>
<p>— 鄭定棨作</p>
<h3>呌化子</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>呌化子是最討厭的東西，假定你在行人道上走，隨便你走在那一條路上，後面便有衣衫襤褸的癟三兄，跟在你的後面，不住的喊着「開開金龍手，歲數活到九十九，」「量大福大，明年開幾爿當鋪，」「做做好事，明年養個大胖兒子，「明中去是暗中來，發財要發幾百萬，」倘然你留心一些的話，你總能够聽到幾位癟三先生，在後面恭維你這樣許多好口彩。</p>
<p>假定你是摩登的奶奶太太小姐們的話，他們還要釘得起勁，你走的愈快，他們也跟的愈快，口裏還要滑稽打趣的喊：「奶奶太太。本些相公老爺，」奶奶太太小姐們看見癟三在後面跟着，還有一陣一陣特別而不大聞到的氣味，從風中送過來，令人惡心，說不定他們還要惡作劇，弄了幾個又壯又昨的老白蟲過來，實在吃他不消，還是給了他們幾個銅子讓他去罷。這樣的呌化子，確是可惡極，然而也是他們討錢的「門檻」。</p>
<p>還有幾個老槍的呌化子，倘然他們趕了一程，不給他們的錢，他們便要駡聲「赤老，」「他日與我一樣，」他們跟披頭討飯，還有一個惡毒的名詞，呌「趕猪玀。」有人給他的錢，還要算他們猪玀，豈不是可惡？我有一决，在路上聽見老槍甲，問老槍乙，你今天趕了多少猪玀，老槍乙答道，今天碰着「赤老，」沒有幾個錢，他們這種無本錢的生意經，着實做得過，所以有人說做了三年呌化，連皇帝多不要做，這話到也有一些道理。</p>
<p>但是話有得說回來了，做呌化子，因爲是窮，沒有飯吃，因爲失業，招不到事體做，所以討飯，到底沒有强搶人家，威嚇人家，路人願給倔錢，固好，路人不給他的錢，他也無法，對於國家社會，雖沒有好處，但也沒有多大的惡處，所以有人說：「呌化子拋了棒便是好人，」但有種出賣靈魂的朋友，出賣民族的叛徒，他們雖沒有討飯，住的還是洋房，行的還是汽車，但是他們一留芳百世」的聲名，永遠不能磨滅，眞所謂盡西江之水，不能洗其惡名，罄南山之竹，不能書其罪狀，此種人可謂絕無心肝。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>後來她和金澹雲商量了一種計畫書，向她幾位中國的老朋友一相商，他們覺得這　企業，很爲新頴。大家都願意投資，除了蘇理雅太太自認股份一半，計國幣一百五十萬元外一。其餘的人，踴躍認股，早超出了三百萬元之外。蘇理雅太太說：「我們此刻還是試辦性質，倘然是人家樂於用這種車子的，我們儘可擴展到全中國，那是資本要數倍還不止呢。比刻旣是大家願意投資，假定這個公司資本爲五百萬兀，現在先收　分之六，試辦起來就是了。』除此之外，蘇理雅太太父與中國朋友台作，開了一個製藥公司。蘇理雅太太到中國的內地去游歷過，見中國的內地人民，太不講究衛生。而新興的中國，實在是地廣人衆，對於公衆衛生，雖然十分注意，只是力量也有所不及。蘇理雅太太這個製藥公司，不像中國戰前那種「說眞方，賣假樂」。或者是一分藥本，「一分裝潢，七分廣吿的可比。她是眞價實貨，希望加惠於一般病者。她與各醫院接洽好了，有時她自己出資，由這個製藥公司製成了藥品，由她個人贈送於各小醫院的也不少咧。還有一件事，要報吿於讀者諸君的，近來中國對於國民的私人營業，其利潤不得超過百分之十。倘然超過了呢，這益出的利潤，要聽公家處置。譬如像許多工廠，對於國外貿易，盈利也很多超出百分之十的，那所有溢利，要極力改善工人待遇。因此近日中國的工人工資以及待遇，都逐漸提高了。蘇理雅太太早說在中國賺來的錢，仍舊由之於中國。其實不但如此，她投資在中國事業中的錢，也永遠的留在中國，供中國的發展了。我們的話，不要儘管似野馬一般，收一收韁。再講到金澹雲這幾天正在忙着，助理蘇理雅太太計畫進行各種事業。所以今天答應了吳君素到蘇州來，正是忙裹偷閑。金澹雲是個有說有笑的人，屋子裏有了她，添了不少的鬧熱。所以她還沒有進得門來，就已聽得她的笑聲。她們許多姊妹，都迎出門來，把個金澹雲簇擁着進門來了。（九八）</p>

<h3>中央攝影塲首次公演　國防劇「戰鬬」</h3>
<p>章泯編劇趙丹導演　主演者白楊顧而已</p>
<p>中國歷史上從來所未有的抗戰爆發以後，一向作爲電影戲劇總站的上海，許許多多人，都馬上離開這地方，投奔到內地去。在這二十二個月中間，道些劇運工作者，深人戰區及鄉村，使一般比較滯鈍的農村及老百姓，都通過了戲劇的橋樑，而和抗戰配合起來。</p>
<p>記得金山會經寫過一篇戰時劇運通訊，他就說，有一個當地的鄉紳，他擁有很多槍枝及武裝農民，但是，他對這次抗戰並沒有表示，於是他們演戲時，（一齣激動救亡的戲）就請這位紳士去看，當戲看過以後，那位紳士很感動地站起來，堅決地表示，他決以全力來打擊侵略者！以這個小小的例子，可以看出救亡戲，它所負的任務，是怎樣的偉大了</p>
<p>這批電影戲劇工作者，除了王獻齋，龔稼農，孫敏，湯傑，徐莘園等已回滬以外，其餘如藍蘋，李琳，左明都在陝北延安，從事劇運工作；金山和王瑩組微救亡劇團出國宣傳；蔡楚生，費穆，歐陽予倩，則留在香港，繼續製片。</p>
<p>上海一般大導演，如應雲衛，史東山，洪深，則都在重慶。而許多上海著名的演員，大都已加入中央攝影塲。這一個以上海導演，演員爲中心的中央攝影塲，在一年中間，已經攝製了許多抗戰新聞片及以抗戰爲題材的影片。</p>
<p>最近，中央攝影塲全體同人，又籌備了一决大規模的公演，演出人員陣容的整齊，是內地演出中少見的。而且這中問，大多數是上海的熟人。</p>
<p>這次公演的戲，是一齣五慕國防劇，名字是呌「戰鬬」，編劇者是過去爲業餘實騐劇團導演過「羅密歐與朱麗葉」「大雷雨」等的導演人章泯，負責導演的，却是上海聞名的小生趙丹，「舞台監督」是以演「在歡之夜」縣老爺蜚聲銀壇的顧而已，以及「業餘」燈光打得最好的朱今明。</p>
<p>至於演員，更多大家熟稔的演員，如白楊，施超，魏鶴齡，顧而已，錢千里等及中央攝影塲全體演員。公演的戲院，是國泰大戲院。我們雖然沒有看見這决演出，但一定可以想見，公演時的熱烈及成功的海</p>
<h3>伶人動態</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>馮子和有意出家　老伶工馮子和。晚年好佛。課徒自娛。近爲黃金大戲院編一武俠劇。取材於胡螺兒傳。業已全部脫稿。擬於毛世來南下時排演。昨日記者過訪。暢談良久。渠忽表示將往出家。並謂一切籌備就緒。此係極好之機會。在今年將實行。惟暫留居在滬。俟時勢好轉。擬向普陀山逃禪云。</p>

<p>舞國寫影</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>誰之罪惡（上）</h3>
<p>幾個月來，報上常見到許多關於舞女的案件，最顯著者，如賀蝶與某舞客之自殺案，顧玉梅與雷姓之涉訟案，我們不能一一來列舉，也不能逐件去批評。書曰：靡不有初，鮮克有終，這許多不幸事件，當事者（二〇）不能愼之於始，也不能不說是原因之一，紅樓夢裏，有二句話—旣知今日，何必當初。我想這些人到最後的一剎那，未必沒有這種感想吧</p>
<p>有一次我從百樂門出來，遇見了一位舞女徒弟，面容慘淡，垂首而入，彷彿有什麽隱憂似的，我問她是來赴的的麽？她說，倒霉人有誰來的呢。我想找個人談談天，師父肯陪我麼？於是我們就找個咖啡館坐下，她說：賀蝶死了，我們再也不能再看見她了，我曉得她是有感而發，於是回答他道：陳小田死了，你也不能再看見他了。她說：怪不得人說你十三點，（舞女口頭禪，大概是神經病的意思。）分明一個好好的人坐在這裏，却怎說死了？我說：這是此刻的陳小田，上决你所看見的陳小田呢？譬如我今天更名呌田小陳呢，譬如我和你上决見面後，永遠不再相見呢，與我眞個死了有什麼兩樣呢。再說我和你今晚在此啜茗談心，似乎是很平常的事，但是以後要想照式照樣再重映一遍，我可以說絕對的不可能。她說，我窮雖窮，這箋箋的咖啡賬還回得起，不要說得這樣難法。我說，不是錢的問題，假使下决我們的在這裹晤面，動機巳和這决不同了，何况我們所談的話，所吃的東西的成人，四周環境和座客，各人心中所含蘊的情緒，能有一樁和這次相同的嗎？太上老君說得好，長短相形，高下相傾，這是說一切外相都是比較的而不是絕對的。莊子說：呼我爲牛，即應之爲牛，呼我爲馬，即應之爲馬，這是說我的一切，是隨着各人的觀察而　易的。所以我們處世，一切不必太認眞。比我長的，就不妨說他是長人，矮的就說他是矮人，待我好的，總是他覺得我好。我也不妨自己承認是好，也不妨承認他是好人，待我壞的，總是他覺得我壞，我也不妨自己承認是壞，也不妨承認他是壞人，至於從前待我好的人，現在忽然待我壞了，那總是他對我的觀念，從前和現在變更了，我叉何妨也變更一下子呢。總而言之，張三李四，那不過是一個代名詞，如果張三從前待你好的，現在忽然待你壞了，你又何必一定要執着從前張三的好印象，你又何妨把他當作李四看呢。過了一陣，我又遇見道徒弟，她說師父眞是好人，那天我不是你那一夕話，幾乎要自殺了。我說，你算我好人，我就算好人罷了，她說，幾時你再同我講講，我如今覺得精神上愉快得多了。我說，關帝廟有付對聯，下聯是「萬事隨緣緣有分分外無求」我同你有沒有再談的機會，那就看你我的緣法吧。</p>
<h3>小型劇塲人物誌（下）</h3>
<p>— 曼伏</p>
<p>時代之部</p>
<p>時代劇塲，塲子較大，座位較舒，而所延之角，亦甚齊整，前臺係一沈某所經營，而後臺則爲張文娟之父連盛所承包，另聘席永逸君主其事，三家「小型劇塲」，賣座以時代爲較好，惜因辦理不得其法，佳座操於茶役手中，非稔客不得佳座，以是塲中時起紛紜，營業漸衰，苟能積極改革，亦可挽在瀾於旣倒也。</p>
<p>張文娟，爲時代之當家老生，　從某某兩君習藝，所學悉非正路，頃已聘老伶工陳秀華爲敎師，名師必出高徒，如「李陵碑」，「烏盆計」，「珠簾寨」，諸劇，蘇少卿先生亦大爲賞識，年方二八，能戲甚夥，倘以小型劇塲之坤角鬚生論，當推文娟爲個中翹楚，較樂弟爲有希望。</p>
<p>蔣慕萍，係蔣鑫棠之女，能戲更較文娟爲多，惜博而不精，做工表情頗不弱，扮相亦佳，藝近馬連良一路，爲識者所不取，戲係乃父所授，倘好自爲之，前途正未可限量。</p>
<p>秋雲艷，坤角靑衣花旦，係已故名武生張銘武之女，扮相雅似盛年時代之賈璧雲，作工亦如之，其藝係渠姑丈劉振庭所親炙，循規蹈钜，完全老派路子，（劉振　即早年馳譽菊部之紫金仙，海上坤旦，大半出其門下，）</p>
<p>素秋，係已故老伶工小孟七之媳，孟小帆之妻，名伶世家，當然不惡，素秋演劇，飾靑衣則端莊矜嚴，扮花旦則風流倜　，小帆亡故多年，素秋矢志柏舟以鬻歌自活，海上坤旦，無與其匹。丘鳳麟，坤角做工老生，即十餘年前在先施樂園優美班生旦兼唱之小鈞培，其戲巳趨入油滑之途，年事旣高，不爲人重，現淪爲班底，但三年前以連奎良之名，在杭嘉湖一帶演唱，頗負盛譽。</p>
<p>周雪琴，女子平劇社出身，乃時代之二路旦角，嗓子很好，惜扮相欠美，其父在大世界乾坤劇塲操琴。安叔英，係朱東梅之鳳儀坤班學生，武工尙可觀，扮相少英俊氣，咬字亦欠佳，惜身材矮小，爲其最大吃虧處，但戲路頗正，小型劇塲中不易多見。</p>
<p>沈俊卿，男角，演小生，扮相太俗，惟演狀元譜鴻　禧等窮生戲很好。</p>
<p>侯劍坤，亦男角，唱花面，嗓音宏亮，架子亦好。</p>
<p>盧慶元，小丑前輩，係王長林之徒，人老珠黃不值錢，老伶工之遭遇竟如此。</p>

<p>自本報以豆餅身分問題發表後，旋接有油餅業公會爲大有餘聲明前來，已見前昨各報，但本報商業新聞，立塲公正，旣有所聞，復有更正，則本問題應供讀者以更明白之見解，庶幾涇渭可分，羣疑自釋，爰向油廠業方面調查得左列情形。</p>
<p>八一三前，本埠榨油廠事業，頗形發展，設於潭子灣及曹家波浜北者，計有昌記·立德·生和隆·大昌新·順餘·恒興泰·穗豐·七家，浦東者計有大德新（設在楊家渡專榨豆油）長德兩家，設於公共租界者，僅大有餘（兼榨豆油等）及大德新（此廠專榨棉油）兩家，各廠出品以豆油·豆餅·棉油·棉餅·爲大宗，一部分兼榨椰子油·菜油·及花生油等，戰事發生後，浜北浦東諸廠，巳無法開工，財產及營業方面，揖失不貲，至大德新及大有餘兩廠，因在安全區內，損失較少，但營業亦曾一度停頓，直至去年四月間，始將棉子部份恢復工作，但以環境關係，交通不便，故原料方面，時虞不　，且當時漏稅豆油傾銷市上，致棉油價格，大受影響，故亦僅維持職工工作而已。</p>
<p>兩廠以大有餘規模較大，故以一部份自用外，兼代大昌新榨裂椰子油，並代客家榨製其他植物油類，其豆餅部份，當時因國產黃豆原料，到貨甚稀，加以粵帮爭辦，價格奇昂，廠方不能划合，故該部份未能同時開工，允以此項豆餅，大都運銷廣東·福建·浙江·等地，採辦者均須以原料國產者爲合格，雖是時漏稅關外豆，到貨甚湧，價格亦甚低廉，利益殊厚，聞該廠格於太義，始終未進只粒，其他安徽·蘇北·通崇海等地產豆，續有運到。爲數稍湧，乃逐漸進辦，始於去年八月起，方有一小部分恢復工作，每日用豆二百擔至五百餘擔，出餅四百片至一千餘片，平均工作不過戰前十分之一而已。華南方面，對於是項國產豆餅，採購頗殷，時有供不應求之概，惟限於原料關係，故工作時斷時續，出數不多，價遂自二元七角升至三元五角左右，今年起有一部份　商，以廠餅不敷應銷，於是向某商訂購大批大連豆餅，以供淪陷區域運銷，價的在三元之譜，期餅稍貴，頗屬有利可圖，但此項大連餅，以地位關係，不能運銷華南及浙東等地，乃有奷商某某等，向大連定購冒牌大有餘廠之「餘記」豆餅數萬片，藉以冒充國產，魚目混珠，當經大有餘廠探悉後，曾經登報警吿，一面發給證明書，本月初曾由上海裝神光輪船，運往泉州之餅數千片，內中雜有冒牌豆餅若千片，一時不分皂白，悉爲當地所扣留，後經市商會去電逐一證明，始得放行，至今正式國產豆餅，不免稍受冒牌餅之影響，交易淸淡異常，至淪陷區銷路，已爲連餅所侵奪，蓋因成本關係，價格方面，本廠餅不能貶値與之競爭，故正常商家，殊受累無窮。</p>
<p>浦東長德油廠，原係雜糧巨商陳子彝所經營，華軍西撤後，由日商吉田洋行保管，去年秋由該行自行開工，專榨棉油，今春起，復有戰前已停閉之同甡油廠，亦假該廠榨裂豆油豆餅，餅以「甡記」爲商標，此項豆餅，亦以原料關係，祇能運銷淪陷區域，按市上大連餅，以「源記」「元記」爲著，雜印餅爲數亦多，近聞有人以「源記」餅，運銷福建興化方面，數至驚人，當地以不明該餅來源，致披朦蔽買屬可嘆</p>
<p>目下市匕所謂豆油豆餅買，賣，悉爲大連之貨，故本廠油餅　無立足之地位，至於浜北順餘及恒興泰兩廠，今春會風傳某商要求合作開辦棉子部份，與廠方數度接洽，未經同意，後某商乃擬單獨進行，派人修理　器，搜辦棉子，終以今春原料出數不多，機件亦欠完整，故迄今尙未開工，其餘如穗豐·昌記·生和隆·大昌新·立德·五廠，均在戰區，勢屬無法復工，其中如昌記等廠，業已無形解散，抗戰以還，本埠之實業如此狀况，殊可槪嘆。</p>
<p>華商油廠大多數旣不能工作，內地小油廠亦無貨　　，滬上銷路遂完全倚頓大連油，在中國軍未西撤前，市塲上買賣大連油，不敢公然呌賣，以交頭接耳之形式出之，自去年以還，大連油公開無忌，其後則氣燄愈張，不可一世，且如此决油價之上漲，亦爲洋行所拋出之期貨，到期反汗悔約，原應到期十足交貨，乃祇允解二成半，旣而又减至二成，且大多數只有一成八，期貨旣不解，巿况遂堅昂，又從中操縱搗把，期貨生意旣不可彝，不得不偏重於現貨買賣，實則此項現貨，本爲應解期貨之現貨，照巿現貨價比期貨高，如今改售現，又多一筆賺頭，因之一筆生意有三筆利，獲利之優厚，亘古所罕有，當定貨之始，又須油·餅·豆，三者合定，缺一不可，及交貨之際，呆滯貨之豆餅依然照解，故餅價較廉，而油豆則堅，以其有解有不解也。</p>
<h3>火機花　售價續挫　外棉交易停頓</h3>
<p>本棉生意、雖屢沉悶如故、惟同業對於各機花推進一千五百包外、售價續挫、其中一批價僅六十五元半、身骨比</p>
<p>外棉高價、紐約棉市、晨初先因五月份交頭了結、及國外買出而跌、中間尙有一部份新交易、故仍一度回漲、結果收盤與上日相較尙跌七至九磅昔、美棉之津貼問題、將來困難尙多、然多方對於此種計劃、咸抱恐懼心理、各業俱抱觀望態度、靜候希特勒今日之演說、昨日印棉連同預測略跌二五羅比、埃及漲六磅音、利物浦猛漲十磅昔、折合法幣、計美棉每擔跌四角、印棉跌一角、埃及棉漲起三角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、雖紗價猛漲、然各廠之採辦原棉、仍抱覜望態度、靜聆希特勒之演說及等候美棉津貼問題之解決、再定購棉方針、茲將海外棉巿折合送廠價錄下、</p>
<p>較爲遜也、然廠方完全停頓、一包不進、棉市情形、予紗巿適成一反比例、棉價非但不能前逃、反見退後、實則時近黄霉性身分爲劣之棉、難以久擺、故非廉價脫售不可、但　等之貨、賣價仍不肯十分濯就也、蘇北來源到下沙花五百十九包、茲將現棉情情錄左、</p>

<h3>證券　均以南昌克復　內債頓見興奮氣象　洋股期待希特勒演說</h3>
<p>證券暗盤市况、漸轉堅挺、初以南昌之克復、人心已轉、旣以傳言希特勒之宣言、各國預料決不致有戰事化、因此空方稍趨恐慌、一般機警者、先事抵補、下午幷有金業帮·紗布帮·以及金融界均在收買、數日來盤旋醞釀萎靡不振之象、頓爲之一掃而盡、多數均有興奮之勢、事實如何、姑待證實、茲言其趨勢經過晨初開盤、德孚同潤　茂永豐等號均有買進、市價盤旋趨堅、洽豐天生震康以及三十八號等雖有賣出、已見求過終供、午前略好一角左右、午後消息已佳、各帮買進轉湧、德孚繼續加碼、永康同裕順泰以及二十號均有需要、賣戶已稀、同康聯和及大通稍有脫手、但仍爲買氣所籲罩、再好三四角、丙種又到三元、前途當可好轉、巿價結果微好三角半至五角半、成交總數的計一百萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>

<p>上海衆業公所報吿云、人心對於國際形勢及今晚希特勒之演講、均極注意、致交易異常淸淡、而巿面因之無能有所發展、蓋於今晚德國元首演講未發表前、人心渺茫、無所抉擇、怡和股穩定、除息後價爲十七元七角、（加息二五七角五分合爲廿元零四角五分、）墾殖股降至七元五角、其原因爲華北僞幣貶攸、影饗其公司之盈益云、瑞鎔股尙活動、價在六元九角左右、險皮股仍淸淡而疏忽、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉市醖釀中　出口四萬包弱</h3>
<p>廠粉　昨現粉巿况、本洋粉一致趨平、客帮進胃、已漸減退、蓋北洋帮以天津滙水猛落、需要頓懈、不獨整批交易觀望、即零星小數、亦復見减、南洋帮零星去化、尙不沉靜、且客方意在耍求廉價而取、廠方則以粉價低落以來、原料依然價高、爲顧及成本起見、未肯輕易貶價、故廠盤仍爲四元四角五分、三四號粉亦鮮變化、統市成交數、的計四萬餘包、市面尙在醞釀中、廿九日出口、有一千包運烟台、二萬六千一百包運天津、一萬一千五百包運汕頭、</p>
<p>洋粉　趨勢亦與本粉並馳、查　外定價、仍在二元六角之美金、新定暫吿缺乏、新到亦尙有待、現洋粉售價、依然不肯隨市輕脫、中檔牌子仍與本粉向爲四元四角五分之價、除本街零批交易略有購動外、客胃幾吿停頓、蓋買賣雙方、均有互持狀態、恐短期間、暫少重大變化、</p>
<h3>已把持油豆　又來阻撓米糧</h3>
<p>—上海人生活更艱—</p>
<p>國米　來源自常錫等區封禁後、久無到貨、今南帮米市渡又聞某方竭力欄阻、致河下貨全無到頭、而車輪包子經蘇同帮二千餘包、且聞蘇州亦將有禁運之說、更兼杭紹等地米價飛漲、普通糙粳欲售十二元出零、致內地搬運家若楓練及南港等地之米、悉向浙境搬運、在此變軍情形下、滬埠來源日稀、民食大堪憂慮、至銷塲本街及囤戶眼光雖亦頗銳、奈天時日暖、米質有易變化、大多無意多進、故結果厚薄粳市略挺秀幾分至角砠、杜洋尖埠尖亦祗微緊、變陰兀平平、</p>
<p>客秈　連日被甬帮採辦後市氣逐高、木街店戶零化多嫌昂觀望、昨甬消已懈、市面曾見一度趨平、但本街店舖趁機暢辦、全日零整併計開出三四千包行情隨見續漲數分至近角不等、允以中次見俏、高釉與砶米仍居站局、至來源車運已稀、然江輪來源則有四五千包、緣滬巿連日報漲後、巳引起行販搬運云、</p>
<h3>紗花　投要成白熱化　現紗價一味邁進　雙馬高峯達四百二十上元　比上月低價狂騰六十元强</h3>
<p>紗市續昂、且漲風有再接再厲之勢、市塲情形、大見熱鬧、據大衆意見、謂近來時局勝利、甫昌克復、日僞紙幣下跌、於是投機者蜂擁而來、因之頗有越好越買、而越漲越不肯賣出、市塲籌碼、一時不敷分配、乃漲力鋒鋩萬丈、不過據一部份調查、一般買進者大都囤藏轉棧、裝運出口者殊鮮、且輪運艙位旣缺乏、而銷路允狹、所以買來賣去之交易佔大宗、午後漲勢奇盛、二十支雙馬紗節節前進、高峯曾達四百二十四元、比上日價激漲九元半、查三月二十五日小價曾見三百六十三元半、與昨日之高價相比較、巳在騰六十元〇五角、前途之變化、亦不得不審愼爲妙也、</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、承上日之餘威績進梢昂一元、二十支雙馬棧單價爲四百〇八元、少頃買氣濃密、流言紛紜、莫衷一是、市盤步步上騰、二十支雙馬漲至四百二十元、棧單價爲四百十一元半、價高之後、旋以獲利者吐出、叉復回挫一些、現貨雙馬價爲四百十七元、棧單價至四百〇八元、迨至收盤、又回升一·二元、午後開盤買氣彌漫、均係同行成交、雖有大戶賣出、仍難遏止買風、收盤價二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百二十四元、棧單價爲四百十六元、查全日各方成交統計三千〇二十包、行情二十支雙馬·天女漲八元至九兀半、特金城漲八元半、其餘亦漲三、四、五、元不等、廠方山崇信廠開出大發二百包、價爲三百九十二元、九十六元、至四百元、爲五月份、統一廠開出二十支金鷄三百五十包、價爲四百〇七元、又十二支金鷄四百包、價爲三百四十五元、永安廠開出二十支特金一城一百包、價爲四百二十元、五月份、信和廠開出廿支五子一百二十包、價爲三百九十八元、今日出口紗有八百七十件運天津、二百二十五件運汕頭、一百五十件運香港、茲將各帮買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>日紗市價、晨平、午後復大漲、市上傳言紛紛、謂天津靑島兩帮客人、因日僞貨幣日跌、爲避免損失計、大量囤藏、故實際裝運殊形缺乏也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　越買越有參　東疋居然直綫上騰　全日成效在四千件外　國布白貨買風亦大熾</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>布細布買風大盛、囤戶心思濃厚、奮力拖進、市盤亦愈買愈緊、晨市漲五分至一角、午後續漲一角之譜、成交英商怡和粗布五百餘包、華商大生振中內衣各廠組布二百餘包、大鵬細布每疋漲二角半、售開富貴細布手貨十四元、富貴細斜手貨十二元九角、別牌每疋亦漲一角以上、廠盤每疋尙較市高二角半、成交細布·細斜二百餘包、漂染布疋以現銷淡薄、售盤未能與坯布並駕齊驅、染廠存貨、以一時難獲善價、頗多存儲堆棧、市上便宜貨、同業均有塌進意思、售盤　一致升漲三五角、手貨較廠方廉五角至一元、故新盤無正式售開、本街需用最盛、昆明·重慶帮辦染色細布細斜三千餘疋，贛南廣豐辦色布色斜花布七百餘疋、蘇北及蚌埠辦細布三四十包、色布·花布·府綢購辦二千數百疋</p>

<p>昨細布·細斜售盤、直綫上騰、買客愈買愈有頸、除北路各帮繼續在拖猛進外、本街金融家、因國布現貨缺乏、亦進而收囤東疋、故全日成交數量、細布細斜在四千件以上、北帮的占十之六七，市盤與前日比較、每疋約漲二角至叫角、陽　細布現貨十四元二角半、行　期貨已增至十四元五角、細斜十三元二角半、期貨訂開十三元五角、五福細　下月份做十三元三角五分、寳貝細斜亦須十三元、市面有續步飛騰之勢、</p>

<h3>油餅　豆油再削一元　生油未有做開　豆餅現銷不動</h3>
<p>生油市况、昨因人心渙散、致無交易做開、</p>
<p>豆油則再削一元、刻下大連油仍由日商源源供給、故市氣再遭打擊、計成交現大述油一百桶、價爲四十五元八角半至四十五元五角、七天交路貨四百餘桶、價爲四十四兀至四十三元五角、大連小簍歧油五十件、價爲四十四元、膠州豆油一百五十件、價爲三十二元五角、</p>
<p>廿八日豆油進口、自天津來</p>
<p>一千二百四十件、烟台來八十五件、</p>
<p>豆餅依然祇大豆餅有市、瑞餅銷塲不動、以致影響人心、期餅轉跌、趨勢頗多起伏、開盤至收盤、行情相差達九分、比較上日巿之最高價、須跌角外、計開五月份交源記餅一千片、價爲二元九角一分、雜牌餅七千片、二元九角七分至二元八角八分、六月份交源記餅八千片、價自三元一角一分跌至三元零二分、</p>
<h3>南北貨　桂圓花苗稀少</h3>
<p>桂圓近來以銷路不暢、行號間久乏成交、但以產價論之、如興化泉州漳州等處、照報價合划、均呈倒懸之局、因此號貨無法開兌、而行方亦無意再進、藍現在各行地位類皆狹小、未敢多購、惟據客函、最近消息、新圓花苗一致報歉、漳州的有二三成、泉州二成、興化亦僅三分、然距出新期尙遠、倘於經過期間、設遇風雨摧殘、恐尙須减折、猶有變化云、</p>

<h3>仰光鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 洵</p>
<p>自從滇緬公路落成以來，經當局努力地籌備，不日就可以正式通車，與緬甸鐵路互相啣接，成爲我國對外主要的一條國際交通綫。因此英屬緬甸的仰光（Rangoon）與法屬安南的海防，有同樣的重耍性，現在我國各大銀行，各大商行以及各運輸機關，已都到那兒去設立辦事處。預料不久的將來，該城將有更大的發展呢—仰光旣爲我國對外貿易的重心，對於該地的一切，實有予以記載的必要。</p>
<p>仰光城位在伊洛瓦底江（Lrrawaddy　River）口三角洲上，距離海口二十四哩，港口有二千四百碼闊，四哩半長，船舶可以自由出入。碼頭有三千三百三十二尺長，浮橋碼頭亦有六百餘尺長，凡是進口貨物，都在碼頭卸貨，然後由鐵路或循伊洛瓦底江運入內部各地。出口貨物則用駁船運上繫在港心的大船，載運到各國商埠。仰光主要的進口貨是機械，絲，化學用品，糖，鹽，麻布，及魚等等。出口貨則以米，殺，木材，棉花，鉛，銀，鋅，銅，橡皮，以及碎石子等爲主要。</p>
<p>仰光市街都是歐式，有廣關的馬路，美式的建築物，銀行或商號的大樓，歐式的旅館，允其多而且著名的寺宇塔院。該地氣候，屬熱帶性，通年熱度平均在攝氏八十五度左右。十一月至三月，是氣候最凉爽的時期，三月底四月初，氣候特然增高，所以四月份爲該城最炎熱的時季。五月至十月是雨季，在這時期內，氣候是非常潮濕而悶人的。當你乘輪船抵達仰光港口的時候，遠遠望去只見一片平坦的汚泥底地，一定耍使你大失所望，實在仰光市內的景色，是很美麗的。市內最著名的，是瑞光塔（Shwe　Dagon　Pagoda），這市塔的高度，有三百六十八尺，金光燦燜，在數十里外，就可看到，允其在圍拱四週的綠樹叢中望去，景色實在動人。到塔裏去參拜的，絡繹不絕。其他如達而好西公園（Dalhousie　Park），皇家湖（Royal　Lakes），—離城的七哩，偉大的監獄，東方市塲，還有用象來擔任搬運工作的政府木塲，都是値得一觀的。</p>
<p>仰光的人口，依照一九三三年的統計，共有四十萬零四百十五人。我國僑民居住該城者，也有五萬餘人。僑胞大多數是福建及廣束人，經營的事業，以米，木二業爲主要。除閩粵人外，雲南人在該地也很多的，大都經營寶石。設有華僑中小學多所，並且還有中文報紙數種，我國總領事館及中華總商會，都設在此地，勢力是很大的。同時，緬甸政府，對於旅緬的華僑，並沒有顯著的苛例，比較其他的南洋各埠要好得多呢。</p>
<p>由仰光到我國滇省的陸路交通，有三條路綫：最主要的一條路綫是從仰光乘北緬鐵路火車，經開泰（Katha），到八英，（Bhamo），再乘汽車到中緬國界地點畹町（離八莫僅一七零公里），然後再循滇緬公路經龍陵，保山，永平，下關，楚雄而達昆明，其他的二條，一由仰乘火車經瓦城（Mandalay）至臘戍，再用汽車經南坎而入滇省之南部，二由仰乘火車到密之那至滇省片馬。</p>
<p>由滬港二埠到仰光去的航路情形，由上海去，並沒有直達航錢，可先搭乘任何航錢的輪船至香港或新加坡轉往仰光。英商鴨家公司（B.I.S.N.　Co.,Ltd.—Apcarline），有輪船，每隔二星期，由香港開往仰光，途經新加坡，檳榔嶼等埠，需時的十四日。由新加坡至仰光，則僅需七日。由香港到仰光，票價，頭等二十四英鎊，二等十六英鎊。到仰光去應備的手續，是先要向我國政府發照機關請領護照，經英領事署簽准後，就可以啟程了。</p>
<h3>運往海防　貨物應注意各點</h3>
<p>— 寶泰</p>
<p>在過去，海防原非通商大埠，進出口貨物，遠不如近來之多。倉庫設備，旣屬不周，管理允欠妥善，一旦驟成國際交通重要口岸，不獨倉庫地位，不敷應用，以致擁塞不開；而管理方法，不加改善，遂搆成積貨紊亂之重大原因。加以海防報關手續，煩瑣異常，各地運往貨物，因客商不明該地實際情形，或因單據不齊，或因報裝不明，以致發生延擱或意外損失者實多。茲就管見所及，將應注意各點，略述於后：</p>
<p>裝箱單　（Packiug　List）愈詳愈好，海防海關稅則，苛細異常，引用稍有錯誤，或列舉稍有未詳，即有違犯規章可能。各處運防物品，或用中文名稱，或用英文名稱，在防均須一一代爲譯成法文，其最感不便者，即遇裝有品類不同物品之箱件，（如五金材料，日用品及其他雜色物件。）如未附有裝箱淸單，或已有而列舉不詳，須先將箱件拆開，按所裝貨物，詳細分類，代爲繕製淸單。遇有特種物品，不能確定名稱，則尙須再三研究，此種工作，最爲費時，往往因之延誤多日，是以寄防貨物，能係一箱裝一種物品爲最好。如事實上不可能，一箱內裝有數種物品者，務須由寄件人繕製裝箱淸單，列舉愈詳愈好，該項淸單，應包括（一）嘜頭及箱號，（二）貨物正確名稱，（三）重量及體積，（以每件爲單位，概照公尺公斤計算。）（四）包裝類別。上述四項，如能具備，則在防報關，可無問題。又整批貨物運防，因車輛關係，常須分批運出，故裝箱淸單，必須每箱塡製一份，每份三紙，除在滬留存一份外，餘均寄海防備用。</p>
<p>包裝堅固　海防偷竊之風，已成公開之秘密，若箱件堅固，或可稍免損失。普通箱件，最大以體積二十立方英尺重量二百公斤者爲最合式，逾此則旣不便堆裝，而極易破損。傳聞海防工人，過去裝慣雲南錫塊，故視一般貨物，亦如錫塊同樣之堅硬，往往自高處翻下，其不破裂損壞者幾希？故除以上好之木板做成木箱外，在滬出口騐關後，應加箍鐵皮二道，以資保護。（普通加箍鐵皮，均爲十字形，若以二道鐵皮，作平行者，更爲堅周。）如係貴重貨物，則在木箱內，另做鉛皮箱，以焊錫封口，允爲妥善。至若棉紗，棉布等以軟包包裝者，裝船時亦應注意外皮有無破裂，如有破損，應立即縫補，總之包裝愈好，損失愈少。</p>
<p>上列兩點所述，均爲　愉上普通常識，因其爲普通常識，故易爲一般人所忽略，其中延擱運輸日期與貨物走漏之損失，不可勝計，故不得不在啟運前預作準備。好在此種情形，皆屬輕而易舉，祇須在啟運之前，稍作整理而已。目前海防倉庫，仍常吿貨滿，新建倉庫數處，落成尙須相當時日，故太古，怡和二公司，對運防貨物，限制仍嚴。輪船抵防，常有因倉滿關係，所裝貨物，須先卸駁船，然後陸續進倉，駁卸周折，快則數日，　則一月，方能進棧。近聞太古，怡和二公司，暫停收海防轉口貨物者，職是故也。乃一般客商，鑒於裝運困難，往往趁本身赴防之便，在行李中夾帶貨物，惟海防海關規章，私人行李中，絕對禁帶新貨，一經查獲，即予沒收，甚或罰款，此允不可不加以注意者也。</p>

<h3>內地公路說記（續）</h3>
<p>— 景洵</p>
<p>從貴陽到長沙，全綫共長一〇〇九公里。公路汽車四日可達。自從沅陵到長沙間一段汽車，改用柴油以來，汽車行駛，比較慢些，所以全錢行程，要增加一天。現在把這段沿途食宿的情形，寫在下面：</p>
<p>第一日，由貴陽出發到黃平，此段計長一九〇公里，在貴陽購票到長沙，並不若北綫西綫來得擁擠，在先一日登記，就可以得到車位了。出發後，在馬塲坪午膳，下午四時左右即可到黃平，該城高踞山上，城內十分簡陋，較大的商店及飯館等，一無所有。中國旅行社設有特的招待所興華旅館，一宿二餐，收費六角，另設改良舖位十只，每只收費七角。第二日由黃平到晃縣，計長二〇〇公里，車行八小時半可達，中午在鎭遠午膳，車過鎭遠後，要經過箱子嶺及磐山等地，這段路程，汽車完全盤旋在大山中，十分危險，抵晃縣後，可宿在特的招待所西南旅舍，房金自六角起到一元六角。晃縣市面，全在中山街，洋貨商店及菜巿都在這街上，尙稱淸潔。第三日由晃縣到沅陵，計二三八公里，車行的八小時。在懷化午膳，汽車在辰谿水渡水後，二三小時後就可到沅陵了。沅陵又名辰州，巿面很好，街道以石砌成。特的招待所竹園旅社，甚爲潔凈，價目自六角至一元四角。第四日由沅陵至常德，中途在官莊午膳，要經過靑山崗，道路險峻，山勢壁立，車行到此，十分危險。到常德後，可宿在汽車站旁的民安旅舍，一宿二餐，僅收六角。常德城並不很大，商業也不振，市面均在中山路一帶。第五日山常德至長沙，在益陽午膳，午後就可以到長沙了。據悉此段公路，現已停止通車，所以西南公路的東綫只好到常德爲止。從貴陽至長沙的票價爲四十四元四角，到常德爲三十六元三角。行李在二十公斤以內的可以免費，每逾五公斤，取費三·〇二七元。（常德至貴陽的行程相反）</p>
<h3>旅行通問</h3>
<p>楊賽秋君問由上海至吉蘭丹交通狀况：</p>
<p>（答）由　至吉蘭丹，先乘輪船至星加坡，意郵二等票慣爲英金十四鎊，經濟二等十鎊，法郵二等十五鎊，三等九鎊。行程的七日或九日可達。抵星後，可乘火車至吉，二等叻幣十四元一角一分，三等九兀三角九分，如不乘火車而乘央輪實得力輪亦可。該輪每逢星期六開，五天可達，票價叻幣四十五元。</p>
<p>陳立·胡心·李浩然·楊正白·王健君等間由滬至西安及蘭州路由：</p>
<p>（答）到陝甘去，照現在的情形，祗可取道越南，再經昆明，貴陽，重慶，成都而達西安。抵西安後，再循西蘭公路至蘭州。全程所需旅費，由滬至西安，的需國幣二百二十六元七角五分（輪船房艙火車三等住宿除外）西安至蘭州需二十六元二角五分。全程所需時的二十五日。（如需候車，則需時較長。）</p>
<p>溫冀衷君問到延安及栒邑情形：</p>
<p>（答）抵西安後，可循西蘭公路至邠縣，距離一四八公里，票價六元七角。邠縣至侚邑間並無公路，好在距離僅數十公里，步行或用其他交通工具亦可，西安至延安，並不正式通車，旅客大都結伴步行。</p>
<p>史福晉君問滇越路四等火車情形：</p>
<p>（答）海防到昆明，四等每位越幣十元六八角四分，合國幣十八元一角。行李要自己看管，逾重行李扣牌時，每百公斤收費越幣十六元餘。</p>
<p>胡桂芬·羅漢霖·章炎福·嚴瑛·於以眞·葛劍佩·施一令·林漢遂·韋紹璞·林子倫·歐哲·陳端錄·顧達·鐵奇·吳家勳·吳良慶·華　等君問由滬赴湘桂路由及赴滇渝情形：</p>
<p>（答）自鎭海及溫州港口封鎖後，取道浙東口岸，　不可能，除此以外，取道福州，汕頭或廣州　等口岸轉赴內地者甚多，藉可避免使用護照以及節省旅費故耳。惟據調查所得，閩省本省公路可通行無阻，閩省以外者，都經停止通車，汕頭附近之公路，現亦中斷。廣州灣至鬰林公路，亦已斷絕。綜觀上述各綫，雖可冒險一行，終不著取道越南之妥便。關於此綫之路由及詳細情形，請參閱本刊第三期。顧君所詢至湖北建始，可於抵重慶後，　　千江至　　　　。</p>
<h3>仰光入境手續</h3>
<p>— 軍心</p>
<p>國人在英屬緬甸的首府仰光入口手續，茲就最近探知，分述如决：查華僑前往仰光入口，手續還算便利，不論初來或者是重回，也不分客位或等級，凡是在仰光入口的，全須携帶着中國政府的護照，經過仰光港警務處檢查無誤後，就可以登岸。如果所帶的護照，並沒經過駐在各地的英國領事或者是星加坡護照局簽證過，那可要被拒絕登岸，請你由原船回去。據筆者偭人聽說，華僑因爲手續不明，往往自誤，共所以錯誤的情形，大的如下述：</p>
<p>（一）向中國政府領得護照，就以爲可以人口，常有未經英國領事或星加坡護照局簽證。</p>
<p>（二）有的雖然經過了簽證，因爲沒有注意有效時間，常常因爲已經過了有效期　而被拒絕。</p>
<p>（三）有時在中國或星加坡出口時，有效期間已經迫促，不知道　加簽證，以致到仰光時失去效用。</p>
<p>（四）緬甸華僑回國或到英荷其他屬地後，再回到緬甸時，常誤爲自己所有的那張護照是來回全可以生效，而不去請英領或有關政府去簽證，等到到了仰光，祇有退回。</p>
<p>總之，凡是赴仰光的，除去應辦中國護照外，允其要注意英領或其他機關簽證，對於有效期　，格外應常常注意，免得臨時遭受拒絕。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Great Victory in Northern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Over the past ten days, the Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi have achieved unprecedented victories: recapturing Gao'an, Dacheng, and encircling Nanchang, Fengxin, and Wuning. These victories can, in military terms, disrupt the Japanese army's established plan to invade Zhuzhou and Changsha from the west, and shatter its dreams of splitting the Third and Ninth War Zones. In political terms, they can eliminate the surrender theories of the puppets and strengthen the belief that victory in the war of resistance is certain. This will become the death knell of the total collapse of the Japanese invasion of China, and also the prelude to China's final victory.</p>
<p>Originally, after capturing Nanchang, the Japanese army concentrated heavy troops in northern Jiangxi, planning to invade Hunan in two ways: one through Dacheng and Gao'an, along the highway to Wanzai and Pingxiang, and directly to Zhuzhou; the other using Wuning as a base, moving along the Xiu River towards Tongshan and Tongcheng in southern Hubei, and taking Changsha via Pingjiang. However, the terrain of Jiangxi Province is low in the north and high in the south, making it easy to attack but difficult to defend. When the Japanese army attacked Nanchang, it failed to first secure strong bases on both sides of Poyang Lake. Its isolated forces advanced deep, taking a dangerous gamble, and had already placed themselves in a desperate situation of being surrounded and annihilated. How could it still use Nanchang as a base for invading Hunan? As expected, after the Chinese forces withdrew from Nanchang in a planned manner, they used active tactics and counterattacked in multiple ways: the southern route recaptured Gao'an and Dacheng, encircling Nanchang and Fengxin, cutting off one arm of the Japanese army invading Hunan Province; the northern route surrounded Wuning, preventing the Japanese army from advancing westward; at the same time, the Chinese forces in southern Hubei also recovered Tongshan, cutting off the Japanese army's route to invade Hunan from southern Hubei. These not only exposed the emptiness of the Japanese military deployment for invading Hunan, but also showed that the Chinese army has gradually gained the initiative. If the Japanese army cannot reoccupy the above-mentioned strongholds, its attempt to invade Hunan cannot be realized.</p>
<p>Secondly, when the Japanese army attacked Nanchang, it held a fantasy that after capturing Nanchang, it could separate the Third War Zone and the Ninth War Zone, so that the Third War Zone would be completely isolated, and the Chinese army in that war zone would be easily annihilated, the threat to the areas of Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou could be reduced, and further, it could cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the economic artery of southeastern China and an important transportation route between the southeast and the southwest. Once it is cut off, China's strength for resisting the war will be greatly affected. But fantasy is ultimately a fantasy and cannot become a reality. Now that the Chinese forces have recaptured Nanchang, this fantasy has been completely shattered.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese forces began their counteroffensive, good news has been frequently reported, and more than seventy lost territories have been recovered. However, the recapture of an important stronghold like Nanchang is of particular significance. Because when the Chinese forces previously withdrew from Nanchang in a planned manner, those who only believed in weapons and those who were not firm in their belief in the war of resistance thought that the Chinese forces were forced to withdraw, not because of strategic reasons. Their belief in the certainty of victory in the war of resistance was even shaken. Therefore, Japan took advantage of this weakness and used the mouthpiece of the puppets to spread many inducement theories in order to disperse China's strength for resisting the war and achieve its conspiracy of a quick peace. Now, this conspiracy has also been shattered by the hundreds of thousands of brave warriors counterattacking in northern Jiangxi. At the same time, it has been confirmed that the previous withdrawal of the Chinese forces from Nanchang was indeed planned. Its purpose was, on the one hand, to avoid excessive losses of strength, and on the other hand, to lure the Japanese army to go deep so as to give it a heavy blow. Therefore, before it was occupied, the Chinese forces first gave it a fierce blow, exhausting its strength as much as possible; after it was occupied, they gave it a fierce encirclement around it, weakening the Japanese army's strength; finally, taking advantage of its unstable footing, they immediately counterattacked. Therefore, this great victory in northern Jiangxi not only awakened the illusions of those who only believe in weapons and those who doubt the certainty of victory in the war of resistance, but also eliminated the theories of compromise and surrender, and strengthened the courage of the whole country to resist the war.</p>
<h3>In the Past Twenty Days, More Than 10,000 Japanese Soldiers Invading Shanxi Province Have Been Annihilated. The Chinese Army Has Repeatedly Achieved Major Victories. The Battles at Fushan and Jicheng Were the Fiercest.</h3>
<p>Xingji: Since the Chinese troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains and east of the Tongpu Railway launched their attacks, they have been fighting fiercely for more than twenty days. They have attacked Fushan, Yicheng, Jiangxian, Wenxi, Xiaxian, Zhangdian, and strongholds such as Yuncheng, Jiexian, Congshan Zhang Village in the south, and Ershiling. They have repeatedly achieved major victories, especially in Fushan, Yicheng, and the area north and south of Yanzhang southeast of Wenxi. Hua Peng Zhenpu, the commander of the regiment, died in battle north of Fushan, and Zhang Zhenqi, the commander of the regiment, was wounded near Shicun in Yicheng. The bravery of the Chinese officers and soldiers in annihilating the enemy can be seen from this. According to statistics, the Japanese casualties are over 7,000. There are many wounded soldiers gathered in Anyi, Houma, and Linfen. More than 1,000 Japanese corpses were transported north from Wenxi on the 20th. Currently, there are 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese reinforcements in Linfen, and 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese reinforcements in Fushan and Quwo, separately increasing the forces in Yicheng and Wenxi. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. In Yuncheng, the Japanese army is stubbornly resisting in its strongholds. The Chinese side is using strong troops to enter and exit the railway and launch flanking attacks. In the first ten days of the month, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers advanced south along the northern section of the Baijin Highway. After the Chinese army encircled and attacked them successively at Fenshuling, Zhangdian, north of the highway, and east of Gucheng and Shipan, one-fourth of them were killed or wounded (i.e., more than 2,000 people). The defeated Japanese army fled through Nanguan Town and continued to scatter east of Zihongkou. On the evening of the 21st, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the town, broke through two barbed wire fences, captured two bunkers, and annihilated more than 50 Japanese soldiers guarding the town, seizing twelve machine guns and rifles. By this point, the Japanese army's attempt to invade southeastern Shanxi in separate routes was completely crushed. In recent weeks, the Japanese army has reinforced its forces from Linfen by more than one division. Currently, there are 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese soldiers stationed in Jiangxian. The Japanese army in Yongji and Fenglingdu seems to be withdrawing northwards. However, the Japanese army on the Zhengtai Railway has recently suspended passenger transport. It is rumored that a large number of Japanese puppet troops will be transferred from the Northeast to reinforce Pu. A major battle in southern Shanxi is brewing. In total, in the past twenty days, the Japanese army has suffered 7,000 casualties in southern Shanxi and 2,000 in eastern Shanxi. Including the enemy annihilated in the Jinli Highway, Heilongguan, Jingle, Fenxi, Hongzhao, Huo and other places in western Shanxi, the number should be around 10,000. (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese army in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway has repeatedly reinforced its troops and launched unsuccessful attacks, suffering heavy losses in the triangular area of southern Shanxi, which is unprecedented in the past two months. It is reported that Japanese officers Ushijima and Hirayama have been reprimanded and are planning another large-scale invasion. There are still constant contacts on both sides of Linfen. Most of the Japanese troops in Linfen have been transferred south, and there are only more than 2,000 remaining. The Japanese troops in Fushan and Anze have increased. More than 500 Japanese soldiers in Fushan, under the cover of artillery fire, advanced towards Mijia Yuan (southeast of Fushan) on the morning of the 24th. The Chinese army intercepted them on a certain high ground and engaged in a chaotic battle for a long time, defeating the Japanese army. Currently, there are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers in Fushan, mostly near the east of the city, confronting the Chinese army. Japanese officer Yoneda Akihiro was killed by the Chinese army in a chaotic battle near Anze a few days ago. There are currently 700 to 800 Japanese infantry and cavalry in Heilongguan. The Japanese army has been annihilated by the Chinese army for more than 400 people in recent days. They are currently holding their strongholds and dare not attack. The battle in the area north of Linfen and south of Lingshi has turned silent. The Japanese plan to build roads, but they dare not start construction due to the surveillance of the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Fenxi plans to cooperate with the battle on the Heilongguan side and has repeatedly increased its troops. On the morning of the 25th, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers advanced south towards Heping in two groups. They engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army for several hours in the area of Yumei, Mazhuang, and Liujiagou. Due to the Japanese having more soldiers while the Chinese had fewer, Heping was invaded by the Japanese. The battle situation in southern Shanxi is still fierce in the fierce battles around Suicun. The Japanese main force has been repeatedly defeated and is very panicked. 2,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry and 6 to 7 artillery pieces from Yuncheng and Wan Quan led by Gou gathered and advanced towards Gouxi Wangjiazhuang (southwest of Jiwang Mountain) in four routes on the 24th. The artillery fire from both sides was extremely fierce, and they fought fiercely for six hours, planning to engage in a decisive battle with the Chinese army. The Chinese army knew the Japanese tricks, so they sneaked to the mountain tops and engaged in mobile warfare with the Japanese. A certain Chinese unit engaged in fierce battles with more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers in Wangtong Village (northwest of Yuncheng) for a day and night on the evening of the 25th, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army in Wan Quan successively rushed to reinforce them. The Chinese units have established close contact with each other and are attacking the Japanese. Most of the Japanese troops in Xinjiang and Houma are reinforcing Aikou. A certain Chinese unit is intercepting them separately. There has only been small contact in the areas of Wenxi, Hejin, and Jishan, and there have been no major changes. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Since the Chinese troops in southern Shanxi recovered Wenxi, Shuyan, Yanzhang, Xiangshan, and other places, the Japanese army has reinforced its troops by more than 3,000, and the fierce battles with the Chinese have been extremely intense for days. The Japanese Kobayashi regiment has been annihilated by the Chinese army by more than two-thirds. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Are Transferring Troops from Zhangjiakou to Help in Baotou</h3>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese army entrenched in Baotou has transferred its elite troops in an attempt to invade the west. Recently, it transferred one regiment each of infantry and cavalry from Zhangjiakou to help in Baotou. After suffering heavy losses in Anbei, the Japanese, in addition to strengthening the defense of Baotou, have also increased the number of security teams along the Sui-Bao line by more than 1,000. The Chinese attack troops have separately approached Liangcheng, Saxian, Guyang, and the Kundulun River west of Baotou, and are launching attacks on the Japanese. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Wuyuan: The Chinese troops in eastern Sui were ordered to carry out guerrilla warfare at the junction of Fengzhen and Liangcheng on the evening of the 24th, to contain the Japanese army. They encountered more than 200 puppet Mongol soldiers near Dahaiwan. Because the Japanese army was quite rampant, the Chinese army used a part of its cavalry to outflank them and cut off the Japanese army's retreat. The Japanese army panicked and fled. The Chinese army took the initiative to attack and drove the Japanese army into the Dahaitan, and occupied Gaokou, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese army in the water. More than half of the Japanese army drowned or were injured. Subsequently, more than 20 trucks with several artillery pieces rushed to reinforce them from Fengzhen, bombarding the Chinese army. The Chinese army, having completed its mission, retreated safely. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Wuyuan: The Chinese army in western Sui has repeatedly destroyed the Bao-Sui Railway recently, making Japanese transportation extremely difficult. On the evening of the 16th, they destroyed five or six li of railway near Dayang Village and destroyed more than 40 telegraph poles. On the 17th, they destroyed six li of the car road in Wugongyu and destroyed more than 50 telegraph poles. When a Japanese car inspecting the road arrived at Wugongyu, the Chinese army launched a head-on attack, engaging in fierce battles for two hours, killing many Japanese soldiers. They destroyed more than ten places on the railway near Taosihao and three or four li near Qixiaying, destroying more than ten telegraph poles. The Bao-Sui Railway has been out of service since the 16th. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<p>(Luoyang) On the evening of the 23rd, a certain regiment of the Chinese army attacked the western gate and railway station of Kaifeng again, killing a dozen Japanese soldiers. In recent days, Kaifeng has been attacked by small squads of the Chinese army every night, causing great panic among the Japanese army. The puppet rebels are wavering. Currently, the city of Bian is only open for two hours each day. The barbed wire along the city is electrified from 9:00 PM every night until the next morning, and Japanese soldiers are often carried in cars, three to four hundred at a time, to patrol around.

<p>(Tianjin) Between Xinxiang and Kaifeng in Henan, a new light railway has recently been built by Japanese engineers to connect the Ping-Han and Long-Hai Railways. The contact point of these two railways was originally in Zhengzhou, but because the Japanese army was ultimately unable to capture Zhengzhou, this new railway line was built to replace it. It is reported that this light railway from Xinxiang to Kaifeng is 80 kilometers long and has a wooden bridge built over the Yellow River. It was originally scheduled to open on May 5th, but yesterday, the Chinese guerrillas near Kaifeng suddenly set fire to the wooden bridge with swift action and destroyed all the nearby rails. Therefore, the Japanese plan to open the railway on May 5th has now been abandoned. (Quick News Agency Dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<h3>Pittman Suggests Economic Sanctions Against Japan, Authorizing the President to Restrict Trade with Japan to Make Up for the Deficiencies of the New Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday proposed another legislative bill. This bill authorizes the President to restrict commercial trade with countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty and the United States. In other words, it authorizes the President to ban trade with Japan. Pittman proposed this new bill to make up for the shortcomings of the cash-and-carry provisions in the revised Neutrality Law. At the same time, the proposal stipulates that in order to implement this bill, the President may issue a declaration to Congress before submitting the bill, which will take effect ten days later. According to Pittman's statement to the Associated Press reporter today, the passage of this bill is necessary for the government to deal with Japan's restrictions on American expatriates in China. Japan has made a sacred promise to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, but since Japan's invasion of China, it has not only endangered the lives of American people, but also violated the safeguards of the Nine-Power Treaty and restricted the rights and interests of American expatriates. Every protest made by the American government to Japan has been ineffective. This proposal authorizes the President with considerable power, which may enable the President to reach an understanding with Japan. According to Pittman's proposal, the President is to take measures against Japan by means short of war. Because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has repeatedly held meetings, it has been argued that special clauses should be established in the Far East, as cash-and-carry only benefits Britain and France, which control the seas, while only Japan controls the seas in the Far East, which will benefit the aggressor. According to Congressional sources, the proposal by Pittman has come at an opportune time. However, it is difficult to determine whether the President will announce the severance of trade relations with Japan in the near future. It is generally expected that the President will still give Japan a final chance, and will give the final chance to the opening of the Yangtze River and the occupied areas of Japan, as well as the anti-foreign financial policies implemented by Japan in China, so that there will be room for maneuver. At present, the United States and Japan are already in a state of suspended trade, so if there is no satisfactory solution to the Japanese issue, a trade break between the United States and Japan is highly possible. In addition, when the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting, Republican Congressman Goyer asked for the prompt adoption of a measure authorizing the President to lift the arms export ban to the invaded countries. He said, "If we continue to supply countries that violate treaties, we will be helping the wicked and increasing the power of future enemies." It is found that Goyer is quite influential in the Republican Party. This statement shows that the bill proposed by Democrat Pittman will definitely be supported by the Republican Party. In addition, the chairman of the World Religious Peace Conference, Chu Shi, requested President Roosevelt to convene a conference of signatories to the Non-War Pact as soon as possible. Chu Shi said, "We cannot avoid war everywhere, we must find ways to eliminate war. If the United States had taken concrete action against Japan immediately when Japan invaded Manchuria on September 18, the aggression against China by Japan would not have happened again." In addition, Professor Flemming of Vanderbilt University asked Congress to recall the American ambassador to Japan and increase loans to China. In addition, Goyer advocated adopting the amendment by Mr. Thomas to prohibit the supply of major raw materials or military raw materials to Japan. He said that after the implementation of this bill, it could immediately affect the situation in the Far East and prevent the United States from being involved in the war. Because Japan is currently unable to take care of China, it is not a problem for the United States to take retaliatory actions against Japan's undermining of American interests in the East, and it can promote the early end of Japan's aggression.

<h3>China Orders 79 Aircraft from the United States, Price 15 Million US Dollars, Contract Signed with Many Styles</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources here today, a contract for China to purchase 15 million US dollars of military aircraft has been signed. The party handling this matter is the China Aviation Power Company (i.e., the representative of Chinese aircraft procurement in the United States). Although the counterparty to the contract is the United Aircraft Corporation of the United States, it includes many styles. The United Aircraft Corporation is in fact the general manager of various aircraft factories in the United States. The contract stipulates that the US side will submit 79 light bombers and fighters in April. As for the 15 million US dollars, it will be paid with silver shipped from China to the United States, without using US government loans. Among these 79 aircraft, there are 27 light bombers and 52 high-speed Safersky aircraft. The Chinese side is currently seeking to order another radio contract here, so that 250 aircraft can be equipped with wireless telephone equipment, costing 300,000 US dollars. It is reported that the value of the silver shipped from China to the United States was 1.3 million US dollars in mid-March. According to this rate, the aircraft payment can be cleared within October. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<h3>Hitler Gave a Speech, Refuting Roosevelt's Various Proposals, Announcing the Abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Leader Hitler recently gave a long speech in the House of Representatives at noon today, responding to the telegram from US President Roosevelt. The main points are as follows: (1) Germany is willing to provide guarantees to the countries mentioned by President Roosevelt under mutual conditions. (2) The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is declared abolished. (3) Germany demands the return of its old colonies, but this is not enough to constitute a reason for war. (4) The German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty no longer exists. (5) The guarantees provided by Germany for the existing borders between Germany and France will still be honored. (6) Germany hopes that the volunteers in the Spanish territory will be able to return to their country after participating in the National Army's triumphal entry into Madrid. (Havas Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Leader Hitler delivered a speech this afternoon, replying to President Roosevelt, and resolutely announced to the world that Germany has abolished the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and believes that the German-Polish Agreement concluded in 1934 no longer exists. However, Germany is prepared to negotiate with Britain and Poland on the relevant issues. Between Germany and France, there are no more territorial issues hindering them since Germany recovered Saar. Germany only asks for the return of its colonies to Britain. As for the German volunteers in the Spanish territory, they will return to Germany after the National Army triumphantly enters Madrid, which is not a problem.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech Stance</h3>
<p>Hitler, after briefly stating his attitude towards European politics, turned his spear to criticize President Roosevelt's telegram, saying that no fewer than fourteen wars have occurred in the world since 1918, and Germany has not participated in them. Therefore, Roosevelt should not make appeals to Germany on moral grounds. Criticizing other countries without solid evidence not only disrupts the order of the world, but also hinders world peace. Hitler then traced back the disappointment of the German people with Wilson's Fourteen Points, saying that Germany will never send representatives to participate in international conferences similar to the court in the future. As for Roosevelt's request for Germany to announce its future policies, he rejected it, saying that he is only responsible to the German people and not to others. However, President Roosevelt pointed out the countries threatened by Germany. He has separately consulted the opinions of the countries. Are they feeling threatened? Are they authorizing Roosevelt to come out with this? The replies from the countries all said no, and a few replies were sternly rejected. The truth of this matter is self-evident. As for the rumors that Germany has plans to invade American territory, they are unfounded and completely untrustworthy. In short, since the National Socialist Party came to power, Germany has repeatedly proposed proposals to limit armaments, all of which have been rejected. However, Germany's desire for peace has not disappeared.</p>
<h3>Hitler Never Forgets: The Crimes of the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>Hitler, at the outset, addressed President Roosevelt's appeal, stating, "The outlandish content of the telegram from the American President to me is well known to you. In fact, before I even received it, its propaganda through radio and newspapers had already made it known worldwide. At the same time, countless commentaries in the newspapers of democratic nations seemed intended to make us understand that this telegram was a clever and intelligent document presented to a nation responsible for taking war measures. Since assuming power, my sole purpose has been to restore the freedom of the German nation, and I seek nothing else. What I strive for is only to recover what was previously taken from us by force. Today's Greater Germany does not include any ancient non-German territory. In other words, before white men discovered the American continent, Germany's territory was not only the same as today but even larger, as several provinces and regions were later lost. Logically, all those who faithfully fulfill their duty by fighting for their country and nation should enjoy a reasonable and just peace. But the reality is far from this; millions have been deceived by peace. This is the calamity of the Treaty of Versailles for Germans and other allied forces. The Treaty of Versailles is the crystallization of jealousy, hatred, and unreasonableness. As a result, 115 million people were deprived of their right to national self-determination, separated from their homeland, and arbitrarily merged into new entities by crazed politicians, not by victorious soldiers, regardless of their bloodline, economic life, and other factors, leading to tragic consequences. The so-called politicians of the democratic empires at the time regarded themselves as dictators of a new world order, presumptuously assuming the responsibility of resolving issues among nations. When this new order faced crisis, European and American politicians each withdrew and shirked responsibility, blaming each other to avoid historical judgment. In fact, the countries that brought disaster to our nation are countless, seizing all its colonies and exploiting all its financial resources, driving our country into the most tragic and dark era."

<p>Copenhagen, Denmark: Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, en route back to his post from Moscow, told reporters here that if Western democracies were attacked, the Soviet Union would be willing to assist with aircraft and munitions.

<h3>Churchill's Swift Words: Hitler's Speech Not Worth Attention</h3>
<p>(London) During today's debate in the House of Commons on the conscription bill, Churchill, who served as First Lord of the Admiralty during the European War, delivered a speech endorsing the implementation of conscription. He stated that this was purely a British plan and not a result of Hitler's speech tomorrow. The speech is of no importance. If it contains threatening words, the situation is already bad and will not worsen because of it. If it contains words of reassurance, they cannot be believed without factual proof. If his words are entirely abusive, then why should we pay attention to them? (27th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Germany's Situation: Strong Exterior, Weak Interior</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers all claim that Britain's encirclement policy has failed and that Germany's diplomatic policies toward Yugoslavia and Romania have been successful. Furthermore, leaders of the National Socialist Party have given speeches, asserting that the natural aspirations of the German nation can be satisfied without resorting to war and that the spirit of Germany's rapid progress cannot be obstructed. While these words are pleasing to the ear, the people still feel uneasy about the current situation, believing that the situation of the Third Reich today is far inferior to that of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires in 1914. As the attitude of various democratic countries has become stronger, it is no longer possible for Germany to win over Poland and Turkey and conclude alliances with them. The future situation is indeed not optimistic. (28th, Havas)</p>
<h3>London Market: Very Good Reaction</h3>
<p>(London) The initial reaction in Britain to Hitler's speech has been very good. Stock prices in the stock market, such as military bonds, have all risen. (28th, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Britain Aims to Encircle Germany: Naval Agreement Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>Hitler then commented on Anglo-German relations, saying, "I have always advocated amicable relations and increased cooperation between Britain and Germany. There is no doubt that the British Empire has made significant contributions to human culture and economic life. I admire the achievements of the Anglo-Saxons in colonial endeavors. However, unless the Anglo-Saxons respect not only the interests of the British Empire but also acknowledge the interests of the German people, friendship between us Germans and Anglo-Saxons will be impossible to maintain. 'Those who respect others are always respected by others.' I heard that the British Prime Minister stated that he could no longer trust Germany's assurances in the future. If so, I will no longer hope that he personally or the British people will maintain the concept of mutual trust. When the National Socialist Party came to power, for the sake of promoting amicable relations between Britain and Germany, I suggested automatically limiting German naval armaments. However, this limitation had an important condition: the confidence that there would be no more wars between Britain and Germany. Until now, my confidence remains, but Britain's confidence has been shaken. Opinions in London mostly believe that if Germany clashes with other countries in the future, Britain will stand in opposition to Germany. Not only are private opinions like this, but newspaper editorials and even official statements believe that Britain must be hostile to Germany and implement a policy of encirclement. In that case, the foundation of the naval agreement has been removed. How can I remain silent and watch? Therefore, today, I wish to express my views to the British government: if the British government is willing to negotiate this matter with Germany again, I am still happy to do so to obtain a clear and straightforward understanding. We Germans, driven by a sense of self-respect, cannot avoid naval armament competition."</p>
<h3>The Danzig Problem Must Be Solved: Poland Rejected Proposals</h3>
<p>Hitler then discussed the importance of economic agreements Germany has concluded with other countries, stating that Germany is the largest consumer for various small countries and does not intend to use commercial treaties to bring these small countries into the political sphere.</p>
<p>Regarding Germany's relations with Poland, even though Germany was wounded after the war, it still concluded a treaty of friendship with Poland. The treaty eased tensions in Europe, but there remains an issue between Germany and Poland that must be resolved sooner or later: the issue of the Free City of Danzig. I believe that if this issue can be resolved peacefully, it would make a significant contribution to the European situation. After months of negotiations, a proposal was presented to the Polish government several months ago, the contents of which are distributed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The City of Danzig returns to Germany, becoming a Free State within German territory.</p>
<p>(2) Germany accepts the route of the Polish Corridor and can build railways there, enjoying the same extraterritorial rights as Poland.</p>
<p>At the same time, the German side proposed five conditions in exchange:</p>
<p>(1) Recognition of all of Poland's economic rights in Danzig.</p>
<p>(2) Poland enjoys a free port of any size in Danzig to fully maintain maritime traffic.</p>
<p>(3) Recognition that the German-Polish border is the final border.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusion of a 25-year non-aggression treaty with Poland, longer than my own life.</p>
<p>(5) A joint guarantee of Slovakia by Germany, Poland, and Hungary to avoid Germany's unilateral hegemony. However, the Polish government rejected the proposal, only expressing (1) willingness to discuss the issue of the League of Nations commissioner for the City of Danzig, and (2) consideration of transportation facilitation in the Polish Corridor. I deeply regret this attitude of the Polish government. However, it is not yet a decisive matter. The worst part is that Poland mistakenly believed in an international movement imitating what Czechoslovakia did a year ago, mobilizing troops to confront Germany. Hence, there were proposals for security guarantees and the conclusion of mutual assistance treaties. If an international conflict occurs from now on, Poland will then attack Germany. This naturally deviates greatly from the spirit of the non-aggression pact that I concluded with the late Polish President Marshal Piłsudski in 1934. Therefore, I believe that the German-Polish non-aggression pact has ceased to exist due to Poland's unilateral violation. However, I reiterate that if Poland is willing to abide by the above principles and re-conclude a new agreement with Germany to adjust relations between the two countries, I would still welcome it.</p>
<h3>Annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia: Merits and Demerits to be Judged by Future Generations</h3>
<p>Hitler then recounted Germany's humiliation and economic ruin, stating, "Today, we already know the reasons for the cruel consequences of this great war. In short, it can be summed up as: destroying other countries. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to (1) deprive Germany of its colonies, (2) abuse the nation, preventing it from rising up against the trampling of the oppressors, (3) impose economic chains, making it impossible for Germany to repay reparations for a century, and (4) most shamefully, dissolve the German nation and divide its political regions. I have repeatedly stated that it is impossible to obtain a harmonious solution if European countries do not respect the principle of national self-determination and disregard political and economic needs. I have further stated that even revising the Treaty of Versailles cannot fully satisfy everyone, as there are many territories that can cause disputes. Therefore, I made a final decision. I did not do as France did from 1870 to 1871, declaring the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine as intolerable. However, I will treat Saar and these two provinces separately. After the return of Saar to Germany, the territorial issues between Germany and France in Europe have been resolved. I have also issued binding declarations to several European countries, namely the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, etc., whose replies all stated their willingness to maintain absolute neutrality, which deeply gratified and pleased the German government. There is no need to dwell on our country's close ties with Italy, and we also have friendly relations with Hungary and Yugoslavia." Hitler then recounted the background and motivations for the annexation of Austria, the recovery of the Sudetenland, the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and the retrieval of Memel, and mentioned that in the days before the split of Czechoslovakia, Britain and France had requested Germany to guarantee the integrity of Czechoslovakia, but Germany was unwilling to promise a guarantee. This was because there was a large stockpile of munitions in Central Europe at that time, and in case of misuse, a wildfire could erupt. For example, there were 1,592 aircraft, 501 anti-aircraft guns, 2,175 light and heavy machine guns, 1.09 million rifles, 100 million rounds of ammunition, and 3 million artillery shells in Czechoslovakia. After detailing the above figures, Hitler said with emotion, "Whether Germany's handling of this matter, resolving the danger, is meritorious or flawed, and what the gains and losses are, will be known in the future. There is no need to dwell on it. What can be asserted at present is that Britain has no right to monitor or comment on Bohemia and Moravia, just as Britain's measures in Ireland, regardless of whether they are right or wrong, will not be subject to German monitoring or comment."</p>
<p>Hitler further stated, "What I particularly do not understand is Britain's attempt to bind Germany's actions with the Munich Agreement. The agreement between Chamberlain and me in Munich certainly involved the mutual relationship between Britain and Germany, but it is impractical and rigid to assume that all of Germany's political actions in the future can be measured by the yardstick of this agreement. It is like saying that Britain must consult with Britain first if it wants to take any measures in Palestine or elsewhere. If Mr. Chamberlain now believes that the Munich Agreement has been abolished, we can certainly act accordingly."</p>
<h3>Poland Prepared to Negotiate with Germany</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Major Polish newspapers, including those related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been successively publishing reports that Poland is prepared to discuss the Danzig issue with Germany. Surprise has been expressed in diplomatic and political circles here. Political observers believe that the publication of this news by Polish newspapers during Hitler's speech is particularly important. (28th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to the Polish government's newspaper, Wiesol Porgd, Poland currently has an armed force of one million men, with an original standing army of 400,000 and an additional 600,000 reservists mobilized four weeks ago, bringing the current troop strength to one million. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Listing Various Points to Refute Roosevelt: Refusing to Declare Future Policies</h3>
<p>Hitler then returned to Roosevelt's telegram, stating, "Today's global unease is entirely due to the machinations of international warmongers. In fact, between 1919 and 1938, there were 14 international wars, none of which involved Germany. During the same period, there were 26 instances of violent intervention and armed bloody sanctions, in which Germany also never participated. The United States itself participated in six military interventions, and the Soviet Union participated in a total of ten instances of war, intervention, and sanctions. Therefore, I believe that what Mr. Roosevelt called 'the current world's fear of war' is not due to actual wars but is due to malicious propaganda in newspapers, causing artificial terror. I believe that if the responsible governments of various countries can control their newspapers, carefully publishing information on relations between countries and foreign events, the terror of war can be immediately eliminated. That is the first point. Mr. Roosevelt believes that any great war will inevitably lead to serious and tragic consequences. The reply is that Germans are most deeply aware of this, but I do not believe that any war will have tragic consequences for the entire world unless the entire world concludes treaties, forms organizations, and is drawn into the vortex. That is the second point. As for Mr. Roosevelt's statement that he has repeatedly appealed to Hitler, I have also repeatedly requested the peaceful resolution of international problems. That is the third point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's compassion for the loss of independence of three European countries and one African country, I do not know who the so-called three European countries that have lost their independence are. It should be known that these countries were established in 1918 completely against the will of the people. How can Mr. Roosevelt be ignorant of this historical error? That is the fourth point. As for Mr. Roosevelt's statement that this appeal is entirely a loud call for the welfare of humanity, the reply is, 'If this call from the United States had been made at the right time, Germany would not have suffered from the Treaty of Versailles.' That is the fifth point. Mr. Roosevelt believes that international problems can be resolved by international conferences. This is completely wrong. The League of Nations has failed to resolve any problems in twenty years. What other international conferences are not merely formalities? International problems must be resolved by national strength, not by conference tables. That is the sixth point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's statement that the success of a conference must be conditional on the good faith of both parties, the reply can be, 'Germany will never participate in any international conferences similar to courts in the future.' That is the seventh point. As for Mr. Roosevelt's statement that if I issue a frank statement about Germany's future policies, it would greatly benefit international peace, the reply can be, 'I cannot make any declarations to anyone other than the German people.' That is the eighth point. And if Germany and Italy ask the United States to explain its foreign policy toward Central and South America, what will the United States do? That is the ninth point. As for what Mr. Roosevelt said about various small countries feeling threatened by Germany, after Germany inquired, the countries all gave negative answers. That is the tenth point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's inquiry about disarmament, Hitler first pointed out that between 1919 and 1923, the Allied Commission had proven that Germany had fully fulfilled the conditions of disarmament. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated general disarmament for all countries in the world. Germany's disarmament action had been completed, but other countries increased armaments and turned a deaf ear to Germany's appeals and suggestions. Until 1934, Germany had no choice but to rearm. That is the eleventh point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's inquiry about Germany's guarantee to participate in trade discussions, the reply is, 'The cessation of boycott movements and the removal of trade barriers are prerequisites.' That is the twelfth point."</p>
<p>After replying to Roosevelt's inquiries point by point, Hitler made the following suggestions to Roosevelt: please implement Wilson's Fourteen Points and restore Germany's stolen territories. Hitler stated that a head of state is responsible for the fate of humanity, and he sympathizes with Roosevelt, but the wealth and population density of Germany and the United States are vastly different. Hitler takes Germany's welfare as a prerequisite, while Roosevelt can take the whole world as a prerequisite, as the United States has more raw materials and property.</p>
<p>Hitler's final words were, "My efforts for Germany's justice, welfare, progress, and peace are efforts for the justice, welfare, progress, and peace of all mankind." (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Consider Hitler's Speech a Formal Reply</h3>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic circles here recently declared that after President Roosevelt issued a telegram, according to diplomatic etiquette, German leader Hitler should have replied with a telegram and should not have merely delivered a speech. Therefore, the US authorities do not consider Hitler's speech today as a reply and do not need to make any formal expression. As of now, President Roosevelt does not intend to send a second telegram to Hitler, and US Ambassador to Germany Wilson has no plans to return to his post. Only after Hitler clearly replies on the matter of non-aggression against European countries will the US State Department consider everything and make a decision. (28th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British and French Ambassadors Did Not Attend: Representatives Attended Instead</h3>
<p>(New York) According to The New York Times, when President Roosevelt presides over the opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair next Sunday, he may deliver a speech replying to Hitler's declaration in Congress today. Mr. Roosevelt's speech has extreme political significance. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the latest impressions obtained here, the speech that Hitler will deliver tomorrow is not a war speech. All parties who know the content of the speech claim that there is nothing too surprising in it. It is heard that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has decided not to attend the German Congress to listen but will have Forbes, the counselor of the British Embassy, attend on his behalf. It is expected that the French Embassy will do the same. The United States will be represented by its chargé d'affaires. (27th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People in Berlin are eagerly awaiting the speech that Head of State Hitler will deliver in Congress this afternoon in response to US President Roosevelt, considering it a major event. A few minutes before Mr. Hitler's speech, all work in Germany, except for a very few that are absolutely impossible to stop, completely ceased in order to listen to this extensive speech. Loudspeakers have been installed in all cities, towns, villages, and stations throughout the country. The Congress is surrounded by soldiers and police, with special security measures in place. This morning, Berlin newspapers published news of various countries' expectations for Mr. Hitler's speech with huge headlines. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Anti-Aggression Front Issue: Britain Re-Proposes Suggestions to Russia</h3>
<p>Easing the Opposition of Poland and Romania: Russian Ambassador to the UK Returns to Post to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>(London) After London authorities completed their study of the Soviet proposal, Anglo-Soviet talks have already progressed to a deeper stage. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British government has instructed its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, to present some observations and suggestions to the Soviet government. It is heard that the British government is now anxious to ascertain what attitude the Soviet Union will take toward assisting any neighboring country that requests aid due to aggression. Some quarters believe that the countries concerned may hint that the assistance needed is naval, land, and air forces, or the supply of military goods. The British side is still maintaining silence on the content of the talks, but discerning observers generally believe that if this arrangement is implemented, countries unwilling to acknowledge accepting full Soviet military assistance or forming a concrete alliance with the Soviet Union will inevitably express opposition. Soviet Ambassador Maisky's return to his post today will facilitate Britain's completion of this talk. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Finland: Extremely reliable news has recently been received here, claiming that the Soviet government warned Latvia and Estonia earlier this month, stating that if those countries were to abandon their sovereignty, the Soviet Union would not consider the non-aggression treaties concluded with those countries (established in July 1933) effective for its own interests. The governments of Latvia and Estonia have replied that they will never abandon their sovereignty. Knowledgeable sources here have recently commented that after Hungary joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in February of this year, the Soviet Union used the excuse that the country was relying on Germany and severed diplomatic relations with it. The so-called abandonment of sovereignty probably refers to throwing oneself into Germany's embrace, intending to prevent it, and at the same time hinting to other countries not to succumb to Germany. (27th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky returned to his country a few days ago to report on his duties and contacted the government authorities there on the issue of organizing an anti-aggression group. He then hastened back to his post and passed through here this afternoon, holding talks with Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz, informing him of the progress of Anglo-Soviet talks and the Soviet authorities' views on the matter. (27th, Havas)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark: Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky, flying from Moscow to London, told a newspaper reporter here this morning that "if Western European countries are attacked, the Soviet Union is prepared to provide munitions and assistance. This has been proposed to Britain and we are now awaiting their reply." (27th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the British government decided to implement conscription, Soviet political figures have all expressed their welcome and stated that Britain and France's attitude toward the various dictatorships has become stronger. It is hoped that they can maintain this. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, seeing that Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin has gone to the capital of Turkey, it is known that the negotiations between the Soviet and Turkish countries on organizing a collective security system have made good progress. Potemkin also took the opportunity to make a brief stay in the capital of Bulgaria at the request of Bulgarian Minister Antonov, which also shows the harmony of Soviet-Bulgarian relations. Even though Bulgaria has been wooed by Germany and Italy, it has not abandoned its neutral attitude, which can be clearly proven here. (27th, Havas)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin arrived here today and will discuss the issue of Black Sea defense with Turkish authorities. Once the talks are concluded, he will depart for Bulgaria and Romania. The Soviet side hopes that the result of Mr. Potemkin's talks will be the formation of a strong Black Sea defense pact.

<h3>German Commander-in-Chief to Rome</h3>
<p>Also will tour North Africa</p>
<p>(Rome) German Army Commander-in-Chief General Walther von Brauchitsch is scheduled to arrive here on the 29th of this month to hold talks with Italian military leaders. He will then proceed to the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa to meet with Governor-General Italo Balbo, before returning here to attend a military parade on May 9th, the third anniversary of the founding of the Italian Empire. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that Spanish Nationalist Army Commander-in-Chief General Francisco Franco will enter Madrid in a triumphal procession on the 15th of next month, and Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano will also attend. This has now been confirmed. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Closer Relations between Germany and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Foreign Minister Leaves Germany for Home</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources here, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia will visit Berlin in early June. This has been conveyed to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Marković. Political figures believe that this visit demonstrates the complete success of the German-Yugoslav talks and will produce two results: (1) Yugoslavia's relationship with the Axis powers will become closer; (2) Yugoslavia and Hungary may conclude a treaty of amity. As for the rumors in the Italian newspapers that Yugoslavia will join the Anti-Comintern Pact, authoritative sources here have not confirmed this, but they believe that under the policy of promoting such a trend, reaching this step in the future is likely. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Marković, after holding talks with German authorities here, boarded a train tonight to return to the capital of his country. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and many other important German figures were at the station to see him off. Foreign Minister Marković, before his departure, told reporters that he was very pleased that this trip allowed him to reaffirm the friendship between Germany and Yugoslavia. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Authorities to Berlin</h3>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister to Berlin</p>
<p>The Hungarian Prime Minister, Pál Teleki, is scheduled to depart this afternoon with Foreign Minister István Csáky for a visit to Germany. They are scheduled to arrive in Berlin at 2:30 PM tomorrow and return home on the 2nd of next month. Well-informed sources here have stated that the German and Hungarian cabinet members will discuss various issues of mutual concern, especially Hungary's relations with its neighboring countries. Other issues such as the guarantee of Hungary's territorial integrity, the legal status of the German minority in Hungary, and various technical issues may also be discussed as the opportunity arises. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Passes Conscription Bill</h3>
<p>Second Reading on the 4th of Next Month; Labour Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>(London) The conscription bill proposed by the government was passed today in the House of Commons by a vote of 376 to 145. The amendment proposed by the Labour Party was rejected by a vote of 380 to 143. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) After Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain presented the military training bill to the House of Commons, First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope presented the bill to the House of Lords. Opposition Labour Party member Lord Snell and Liberal Party member Lord Samuel both expressed their opposition, saying it was "unnecessary." After a short discussion, the House of Lords also passed it by a show of hands. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Leader of the House of Lords, First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope, presented the conscription bill in the House of Lords today, and it was unanimously passed by the entire House. The enthusiastic applause Stanhope received was rare in the House of Lords. Stanhope solemnly stated Britain's new obligations to Poland, Romania, and Greece, and emphasized the fact that France and the Soviet Union have already implemented conscription. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>"...public property will be requisitioned in succession." He hoped that the Labour Party would not make any hasty decisions regarding the government's proposed military training bill, so as not to create a stalemate, causing those in other countries who support our country's policies to doubt our determination to implement this policy. "In my personal opinion, the position taken by the government now, that is, the position of resisting aggressive forces, has been unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, which is unprecedented. The people of the whole country are prepared to take all necessary measures to ensure the success of the current policy. This is what I firmly believe," he said.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain</p>
<h3>British and Romanian Economic Negotiations</h3>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross also plans to go to Greece</p>
<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Meets French Premier</p>
<p>(Bucharest) Economic negotiations between Britain and Romania have begun in a harmonious atmosphere. It is reported that the British side has three intentions: (1) To assist Romanian industry, so that Romania, a country based on agriculture, does not become a "colony" of industrial countries such as Germany; (2) To ensure that the interests Britain holds in Romania are protected, and not to allow the Romanian-German agreements on mineral resources, forests, and oil to hinder Romania's independence; (3) To assist Romania in building seaports, so that in addition to railways and the Danube River, it can also have the convenience of navigation. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently reported that the government's chief economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, is currently conducting economic negotiations in Romania. Once completed, he will proceed to Greece to make contact. It is reported that Greece has repeatedly requested Britain to increase the quantity of tobacco imports. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu, when holding talks with Prime Minister Édouard Daladier this afternoon, personally presented a private letter from King Carol II of Romania, the content of which roughly stated that the increasingly close relations between France and Romania were very gratifying. Foreign Minister Gafencu was then accompanied by Romanian Ambassador César Téléscu to visit President Albert Lebrun, and continued talks with Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet in the evening. According to responsible sources, Foreign Minister Gafencu informed French cabinet members of his talks with the authorities of Poland, Germany, Britain, and Italy, and confirmed to them that Germany had never made any special demands and that Romania still maintained its freedom of action. As for Romania's good relations with Yugoslavia, they remained as before and had not been affected in any way by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Marković's visit to Italy and Germany. French cabinet members reiterated to Foreign Minister Gafencu that if Romania were invaded, they would definitely send troops to assist, which was the same as Britain's assistance to the country. Britain and France had also decided to provide as much economic assistance as possible to the country, so that its agricultural products would not have to rely on Germany as the only outlet. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The military training bill proposed by the government has been passed on first reading in the House of Commons by an overwhelming majority of 378 votes to 145, and the second reading is scheduled to take place on the 4th of next month. Prime Minister Chamberlain made a speech beforehand, urging the House of Commons to vote on it tonight, stating that although he had offered a promise on the 29th of last month, declaring that he would never implement conscription in peacetime, the current situation is completely different from the situation at that time. Since our country has accepted obligations to Poland, Greece, and Romania, its responsibilities have also greatly increased. There are already doubts abroad about whether our country has the determination to fulfill its obligations, so implementing national military training is imperative and brooks no delay. "Because our country's efforts to organize an anti-aggression front are obviously hindered by such doubts, we must correct them." Then the Prime Minister touched on the measures planned to restrict the profits of the arms industry, stating, "We cannot, on the one hand, demand that the people participate in compulsory military service, and on the other hand, allow others to take the opportunity to make profits. Reasonable profits for the arms industry, although we are unwilling to deprive them, but if we allow them to make unlimited profits, it is also not tolerated by the general public. Although the taxes borne by the wealthy class are already considerable, if a war does occur in the future, they must be greatly increased. At that time, private wealth is often regarded as public property and requisitioned in succession." He hoped that the Labour Party would not make any hasty decisions regarding the military training bill proposed by the government, so as not to create a stalemate, causing those in other countries who support our country's policies to doubt our determination to implement this policy. "In my personal opinion, the position taken by the government now, that is, the position of resisting aggressive forces, has been unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, which is unprecedented. The people of the whole country are prepared to take all necessary measures to ensure the success of the current policy. This is what I firmly believe," he said.</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Opposition Labour Party leader Clement Attlee and Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair successively made speeches to oppose it, while Conservative Party right-wing leader Winston Churchill supported it. Finally, Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha concluded the debate. As a result of the House of Commons' discussion, it finally rejected the Labour Party's amendment and then, by an overwhelming majority of 378 votes to 145, passed the military training resolution. The following is a summary of the speeches made by Attlee, Sinclair, Churchill, and Hore-Belisha.</p>
<p>(1) Labour Party leader Clement Attlee said, "Our party is prepared to make sacrifices for the welfare of the country, which is no different from the government authorities, but we cannot agree with the implementation of conscription. At a time when the country urgently needs spiritual unity, this move will not only fail to strengthen the country's power, but will weaken it and divide it." Furthermore, if a war does occur in the future, Britain, in addition to making many efforts in the navy and air force, will hardly be able to imitate the scale of continental countries and form a strong army, and supply ammunition to various allied countries. This is obvious, and it can be seen that conscription is really unnecessary.</p>
<p>(2) Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair said, "When a war occurs in the future, the tasks that Britain undertakes should not be lower than those of other allied countries. The British army units sent to the continent should number more than 500,000, plus a reserve army of 500,000, then the British expeditionary force can reach as many as 1 million. All of this is what we recognize, but our party believes that the voluntary service system has not been fully utilized. Even with regard to the military training bill proposed by the government, its target is only young people aged 20 to 21, not the entire adult male population, and it is also felt that things have not been fully done."</p>
<p>Conservative Party right-wing leader Winston Churchill fully supported the military training bill, stating, "If those who oppose conscription prevail, then the entire organization of European countries resisting National Socialism will inevitably collapse as a result. But there is one thing that must be stated, I also believe that merely calling up young people aged 20 to 21 is really inadequate. The government seems to have to take other appropriate measures to ensure complete success. As for the obligations that Britain has accepted to other countries, they are the foundation of the security of various democratic countries."</p>
<p>(4) Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha declared at the conclusion of the debate, "Our country's entire regular army should have 224,000 men, but currently there are only 204,000 men. The reserve army should have 325,000 men, but currently there are only 167,000. As for the army auxiliary force, it was originally set at 96,000 men, but currently there are only 80,000 men. Among them, as far as the regular army is concerned, according to the current establishment, its personnel cannot be increased. As for reserve army officers and soldiers, they are all citizens with occupations, and it is also inconvenient to increase the training period. From this, it can be seen that implementing national military training is already imminent. The reason why the government takes young people aged 20 to 21 as the target is because most of these young people are in school, and it does not hinder them to temporarily suspend their studies. There are a total of 300,000 young people aged 20 to 21 in the country, among whom 30,000 have already joined the regular army or are serving in the auxiliary force. In this way, after the implementation of military training, another 270,000 can be called up." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Mediation Process</h3>
<p>(New York) New York Times correspondent stationed in Washington, Clarence K. Streit, recently published an article in the newspaper, describing President Roosevelt's mediation of the European situation, stating that President Roosevelt, when the European situation was repeatedly critical between May and September of last year, sent a representative to Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, and requested that the suggestions be conveyed to German leader Adolf Hitler, the content of which was to invite Mussolini and Hitler to each take warships to a neutral island in the North Atlantic, such as the Portuguese Azores, to meet with him, because "President Roosevelt wanted to directly ascertain what kind of minimum demands Germany and Italy were making for maintaining lasting peace, so as to know whether or not he could mediate." According to Washington sources, Prime Minister Mussolini conveyed this suggestion to the German authorities, but it was politely declined, saying that even if Hitler believed that this meeting had the possibility of reaching an agreement, he would not be able to leave Europe at this time. Although the time of this process cannot be determined with certainty, "it was roughly before the Munich Conference in September of last year, that is, before President Roosevelt directly telegraphed an appeal to Hitler." Since this matter was unsuccessful and left no trace, it is of course denied by the parties involved, but "it is a clear proof that President Roosevelt never made any provocative moves in the European situation. On the contrary, he was prepared to sacrifice his political future to maintain European peace." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Ships Pass Through Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Gibraltar According to an official announcement, several German ships planning to conduct exercises in the vicinity of the Spanish coast passed through the Strait of Gibraltar today and entered the Mediterranean Sea. The battleship Graf Spee is currently moored in Ceuta with a destroyer and six submarines. Its sister ship, the Deutschland, is in Malaga with two destroyers. The German ship Köln has arrived in Algeciras and exchanged ceremonial salutes with the local garrison. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar The French battleship Provence, the cruiser Jean de Vienne, and three destroyers arrived here today. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Today, an international fleet has gathered in the western gateway of the Mediterranean Sea. This fleet includes 53 warships from Britain, France, and Germany, anchored in the Strait and off the coast of Spanish Morocco. Among them are the German battleship Admiral Spee and six German submarines. The British fleet includes the HMS Resolution and many other small ships. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>Creating a New Situation in "Pan-American Diplomacy": The Military, Political, and Commercial Fronts - A Traveler in Huatun</h3>
<p>The Psychological Strategy of Germany and Italy</p>
<p>Special Correspondence for this Newspaper from Paris</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes, "Those without immediate foresight will have immediate worries." The diplomatic arena is like gambling. A country with strong armor and weapons and economic knowledge and scientific expertise as its backing, if it is good at creating an atmosphere, can achieve extraordinary success without much effort. For example, German leader Adolf Hitler annexed Austria and swallowed Czechoslovakia without bloodshed (Note: "Xi" means small house, and "Hitler" in German means someone hidden in a small house). He secretly employed psychological strategies to avoid chopping and killing and hatred and conflict, and loudly touted a new method of destroying countries without losing strength, which is truly chilling. As for the mutual support of the dictatorial countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is even more like short selling in the speculative market. Germany and Italy have no real strength in Asia, and their involvement in the Far Eastern war has been like a horse and a cow unrelated to each other from beginning to end. However, the war-loving countries of the East often find it convenient to take advantage of the tense atmosphere of Germany's gradual progress, seize the opportunity to gain profit, and use the gambling skills to restrain the whole world. The strategy of psychological warfare, feigning an attack in the east while striking in the west, when used at the right time, can move the whole body by pulling a single hair. Recently, the expansion of German territory has come to an end, and Italy's coercion against France is also making a gradual shift. A contemporary satirical cartoonist, P. van der Hem, has created a new picture, published in a certain Western European newspaper, entitled "Throwing Everything on One Last Bet." In the picture, two important figures from France and Italy are sitting face to face, concentrating on playing cards, while British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler are standing opposite each other in shock, each minding their own business. Slightly further away in the background are the Russian Commissar, Joseph Stalin; the Outer King of China; Japan's Hiranuma; and America's Roosevelt, standing like wild geese and cranes, looking eager and nervous, wondering what the outcome of this "big bet" will be. The depiction is vivid and lifelike. America in this world is blocked by the ocean on both the east and west sides, and its neighbors to the north and south have little real strength. Its air, sea, and land defenses are not easily attacked by enemies. Logically speaking, it should not have anything to fear, regardless of who it is facing. Unexpectedly, after the meeting of the four great powers of Britain, Italy, France, and Germany on September 29 of last year to resolve the fate and future of the democratic country of Czechoslovakia, America's diplomacy suddenly changed from its former arrogant style of dominating the north and south continents to withdrawing and becoming friendly with the small countries of Central and South America. America's distant affairs have abandoned its old plan of focusing on the Pacific Ocean to single-handedly defend against Japan, and turned its attention to the Atlantic Ocean, which faces Europe remotely. Moreover, the Spanish Nationalist Army and Italy each have historical ties of race and language with the Latin countries of Central and South America. America's opposition to the increasingly strong atmosphere of the Germany-Italy faction is worried about the distance and unconsciously relaxes its hold on the Pacific Ocean. This change in national policy can be proven by the following facts. Its indirect influence on the Chinese situation is clear to those with insight at home, and does not need to be elaborated.</p>
<p>(1) Domestically: America's wealth and its geographical advantage of not being easily attacked by enemies are more favorable than those of European countries. Regardless of which faction is in the country, they all agree on expanding military defenses.</p>
<p>(2) Central and South America: Until a few months ago, scholars in the country who were deeply familiar with the diplomatic situation, as well as newspapers with very well-informed international news, paid little attention to the countries of Central and South America. Recently, since the Pan-American Conference was held in the capital of Peru, the American people's attitude has changed. They have even said that once something happens, America will take it as its responsibility to protect the countries of Central and South America, and there will no longer be any distinction between them.</p>
<p>(3) Overseas: The American people have always been on the sidelines when it comes to European affairs, and their opinions on diplomatic issues are often inconsistent. Now, the entire country, from top to bottom, has a clear understanding and claims that once something happens in Europe, America will definitely join Britain and France in the war.</p>
<p>(4) Military Front: Brazilian Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha has stayed in Washington, D.C., for several weeks. Although the purpose is to finalize commercial matters between the two countries, the actual purpose is to negotiate the military mutual assistance plan between the two major countries of North and South America. The American naval advisory group has also arrived in the Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, because Brazil is slightly closer to Europe, it will make it especially convenient for Brazil to receive a steady supply of American-made products such as aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. It is also heard that the American government will appoint 29 officers from the air and land forces to go to Haiti, Nicaragua, and other countries in Central and South America to run military schools for them. Military students from Central and South America will be entitled to the special privilege of attending advanced American universities. The authorities also plan to select three of the newest and most advanced cruisers from various fleets to patrol the main seaports of South America and cruise the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, starting in April and aiming to pass through the Panama Canal on June 4. American President Roosevelt also changed the naval maneuvers that were held in the Pacific Ocean in previous years to be held in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>(5) Business Front: American Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins is now abandoning the capitalist imperialism of asset-rich countries towards the countries of Central and South America, and replacing it with a new policy of equal interaction. In the future, there will be mutual communication and a two-pronged approach. Not only will America seek to sell its goods to the other party, but it will also buy the other party's goods that are waiting to be sold. At the same time, the American Export-Import Bank will invest heavily to revitalize all the industries of Central and South America, and will commit to improving agriculture. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Aurora Women's College Holds Completion Ceremony for New Building Today</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, the Bishop of Shanghai, Haou Kesee, held a moving ceremony yesterday (the 27th) afternoon in the new building at 181 Rue Poussin, blessing the new building of Aurora University Women's College. The university will officially open tomorrow (the 29th) with another ceremony. The Jesuit fathers of Aurora University have been planning the construction of a new building since 1937 to benefit young women seeking advanced education. Because many Chinese still oppose co-education, it is considered urgently necessary to establish a separate women's university in Shanghai. The new women's university was originally scheduled to open last year, but the construction was completely halted due to the war in 1937, preventing its opening on schedule. The president of the women's college is concurrently the president of Aurora University on Rue Luber, and the curriculum is the same, including Chinese and English/French literature, history, geography, pedagogy, chemistry, etc., with the addition of a domestic science course.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consul Visits Chairman of the Municipal Council, Requests Suppression of Anti-Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Council Does Not Wish to Restrict Freedom of the Press</p>
<p>But Will Seek Solutions If Offense is Caused</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, it was revealed yesterday (the 27th) that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, visited Fessenden, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Wednesday afternoon, demanding that immediate steps be taken to ban anti-Japanese propaganda and anti-Japanese newspapers in the International Settlement. Miura handed a note to Fessenden in person. According to a senior official of the Municipal Council, the note was "couched in very polite terms," stating that the outbreak of anti-Japanese sentiment in the International Settlement was mainly due to Chinese-owned newspapers, which the Japanese authorities were very uneasy about, and requesting that all anti-Japanese propaganda and anti-Japanese newspapers in the International Settlement be banned.</p>
<p>The Council Studies the Note</p>
<p>It was heard yesterday that the Council members are currently studying the note and considering the memorandum previously issued by the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association. However, no formal reply has been given to the Japanese authorities regarding the note. According to a Council official who spoke to reporters yesterday, Fessenden and the Council members have long considered the issue of anti-Japanese propaganda and the outbreak of anti-Japanese sentiments in the press. While they do not wish to restrict the freedom of the press, they are responsible for taking action against any newspaper whose outbreak of emotions or propaganda may cause discord or offense in Shanghai. Action against such drastic propaganda, whether anti-Japanese or not, will be considered in the near future.</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Puppet "Mayor's" Protest</p>
<p>Miura's note followed a protest lodged by the "Mayor of Shanghai," Fu Xiaoan, with the French Consul-General, Baudoz. Fu's protest demanded that immediate steps be taken to arrest the murderers of Wang Xianming, a former official of the "Shanghai Municipal Government," who was assassinated in the French Concession on April 17, and requested that effective and appropriate steps be taken to arrest and control political terrorists in the French Concession to prevent similar crimes from recurring in the future. He also requested that the French Concession police authorities cooperate with the police officers of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" in searching for political terrorists in the French Concession. It is heard that the French Concession authorities are still considering this protest and have not yet replied to Fu Xiaoan, and are also studying the notes Fu sent on February 17 and March 10.</p>
<p>The Police Department Has Issued a Warning</p>
<p>According to the Continental Times, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday (the 27th) that the publishers and editors of Chinese daily newspapers published in the International Settlement, except for those owned by the Japanese, have received warnings from the Political Section of the Police Department against publishing material "likely to disturb peace and order." It is also heard that the French Concession authorities have recently taken similar steps. The Japanese Consulate authorities made requests to Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, and the foreign consulates here last week, regarding their nationals issuing Chinese daily newspapers. The Police Department issued the warnings apparently following this request.</p>
<p>British Consul Advises Newspaper Companies to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Philip, the British Consul-General here, recently summoned the British publishers and editors in charge of Chinese newspapers and suggested that they cooperate and not publish words that the Police Department considers destructive. It is heard that the American authorities have not taken similar steps. The Police Department's warning is of a general nature but clearly states that if the Police Department believes that a Chinese newspaper violates the general warning, it will take police action regardless of who owns it. As to what kind of action will be taken, it was not clearly stated.</p>
<p>Opinions Differ</p>
<p>According to a famous lawyer here, detaining newspapers issued by foreign businessmen or intimidating news vendors may cause legal disputes, as such actions would be an extension of police power beyond its scope of authority. It is heard that publishers are willing to do their best to cooperate with the Police Department, but some have expressed that they cannot agree to suppressing legitimate news. Pressure has also been applied for several weeks on the publishers and vendors of books that do not need to be registered with the authorities of the two concessions. The Police Department has detained books, often with the participation of Japanese agents. Among the books seized is a Chinese translation of "Japanese Spies" by Vaughn, published by the Hua Mei Publishing Company.</p>
<h3>Ningbo City Area Bombed, People Extremely Calm</h3>
<p>Seventeen Bombs Dropped on Both Sides of Ling Bridge</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Killed and Wounded, Huge Fires on Both Banks</p>
<p>Whether Ling Bridge Was Destroyed Awaits Further Reports</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday, five Japanese planes suddenly flew in along the coast in Ningbo. The air defense department immediately sounded the alarm, and citizens rushed to take shelter. The Japanese planes flew over the vicinity of Ling Bridge, circled several times, and then dropped seventeen bombs on the Banbian Street and Gonghou Street areas before fleeing. The houses in those two areas immediately caught fire, and more than a hundred citizens were killed and wounded. Rescue teams immediately went into action and bravely carried out rescue operations. By evening, the fire gradually subsided, and the dead and wounded were collected and treated separately. The people are calm, and local order is also good.</p>
<p>The Bombing Situation is Quite Serious</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, on the morning of the 26th, three Japanese planes carried out an air raid, dropping five or six bombs on the China Merchants Wharf in Zhenhai Port, attempting to bomb the Old Taiping Bridge, but most of them fell into the river, so there was not much damage. Unexpectedly, the shipping department of the German company "Rhein und Seehandel" in this city received a telegram from its Ningbo branch yesterday afternoon, saying, "This morning, five Japanese planes attacked Ningbo and dropped seventeen bombs on both sides of Ling Bridge, injuring many people and setting houses on fire. At the time of sending the telegram, the fire was not extinguished. More details to follow. Sent at 11:00 AM." The company subsequently received a telegram from its Ningbo branch at around 5:00 PM, (omitted above) "Seven Japanese planes extensively bombed the Ling Bridge area in Ningbo at 8:30 this morning. The number of deaths and injuries is definitely more than one hundred. The fire had not stopped by 3:00 PM. The houses from Houtang Street in Jiangdong and from Tianhou Temple to the Xiaocai Market near Ling Bridge have all been damaged. Sent at 4:00 PM."</p>
<p>Ningbo People in Shanghai Are Extremely Concerned</p>
<p>After the above telegrams arrived in Shanghai, the general Ningbo people in Shanghai were very concerned when they heard the news, because it concerned their hometown, and they inquired with the fellow villagers association and other related parties. In particular, they were worried about whether Ling Bridge had been destroyed. According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, Ling Bridge is the old Jiang Bridge. In 1935, Ningbo gentry in Shanghai, including Jin Tingsun, Zhang Jiguang, Sun Meitang, Yuan Ludeng, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Maotang, and Fang Jiaobo, initiated the project and raised 700,000 yuan to rebuild it. The entire bridge was constructed with reinforced concrete, and the project was extremely magnificent. It was completed in May 1936. The bridge was purely for the convenience of Ningbo city's vehicular traffic and to enhance the city's appearance, and it has no military significance whatsoever. The eastern end of Ling Bridge is Jiangdong Street, and the western end is Xianhe tou (i.e., Banbian Street). The area is lined with shops and the city is prosperous, so the deaths and injuries will definitely be numerous as a result of this Japanese bombing. However, Ningbo is purely an undefended city, and the indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes only serves to kill innocent people. According to the Datong News Agency, news relayed from Ningbo to Shanghai stated that Ling Bridge was not bombed, and the Japanese planes flew towards Zhenhai after dropping their bombs in Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Customs Officials Ordered to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Planning to be Loaded onto the Minghe Wheel to Shanghai</p>
<p>Considering Security Issues</p>
<p>Customs officials at Ouhai Customs in Wenzhou, Eastern Zhejiang, have been ordered to evacuate and are in contact with the Portuguese merchant ship "Minghe," owned by the Vanguarda Maritima Nacional, which is docked in Wenzhou, with the intention of chartering the ship to transport the customs officials to Shanghai. The ship has also telegraphed Shanghai to ask the company for instructions. The Shanghai company is considering the safety of the "Minghe" sailing to Shanghai because the Japanese have been indiscriminately detaining Portuguese ships. Therefore, the date of departure of the "Minghe" to Shanghai depends on the decision of the Shanghai company after consideration.</p>
<h3>British Shipping Most Affected After Illegal Blockade by Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Shipping of All Countries Declining</p>
<p>Will Be Eliminated If Competition Not Maintained</p>
<p>Opening of the Yangtze River Still a Distant Prospect</p>
<p>Since Japanese warships blockaded all coastal ports in China, refused to open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, hindered the passage of merchant ships of various countries, and arbitrarily inspected, detained, and deliberately made things difficult, attempting to monopolize the shipping industry in various places, while at the same time vigorously expanding shipping lines in China, the shipping industries of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany in China have all been affected and have declined abnormally, while Japan has suddenly seen improvement, with merchant ships entering and leaving ranking first. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping of Various Countries</p>
<p>The number of merchant ships entering and leaving China for various countries in the first quarter of this year: Japan 1,545 ships, 2,526,387 tons; Britain 826 ships, 2,344,767 tons; Norway 244 ships, 519,514 tons; Germany 80 ships, 400,916 tons; Netherlands 53 ships, 242,329 tons; France 31 ships, 197,629 tons; United States 26 ships, 150,325 tons; Italy 29 ships, 142,892 tons; Denmark 60 ships, 165,628 tons; Sweden 13 ships, 45,032 tons; Greece 7 ships, 23,039 tons; Panama 8 ships, 13,682 tons; Portugal 170 ships, 7,406 tons,</p>
<p>British Influence</p>
<p>The shipping industry of various countries in China has always been dominated by Britain. Last August, it was 1,128,037 tons, September 1,219,250 tons, October 922,154 tons, November 872,546 tons, December 814,079 tons, January this year 840,302 tons, February 713,408 tons, March 791,057 tons. This proves that British shipping in China has gradually declined and has retreated from its leading position to second place, while Japan has risen to first place. For example, in January this year, it was 759,889 tons (second place), in February it was 832,149 tons (first place), and in March it was 934,349 tons (first place).</p>
<p>Attempt to Monopolize</p>
<p>The shipping industry is closely related to trade. The prosperity or decline of the shipping industry is the prosperity or decline of trade. Now, in order to sell Japanese goods in the occupied areas and implement its economic aggression policy, Japan controls the trade in its occupied areas, excludes the import of goods from various countries, and at the same time, under the pretext of military relations, obstructs the navigation of various countries in China, and vigorously expands the Japanese shipping industry in China, such as forcibly confiscating Chinese ships, opening up new shipping lines in various places, and giving Japanese ships priority in carrying passengers and goods. As a result, the Japanese shipping industry in China has unexpectedly jumped to first place since February this year, and the tonnage of ships has been increasing month by month. It also uses its special influence to illegally prevent merchant ships from various countries from entering non-occupied areas. Therefore, if Britain and France do not strive to compete, the shipping industry in China will be monopolized and seized by Japan in the future.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Sweep: Japanese Troops at Nanqiao</h3>
<p>Over 40 Killed</p>
<p>Over 20 Drowned</p>
<p>The Japanese troops at Nanqiao, after being attacked by guerrillas on three fronts for several consecutive days, still attempted to resist stubbornly. The fighting was fierce. The guerrillas charged forward relentlessly, engaging in over a dozen hand-to-hand combat encounters. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. In the end, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and collapsed, retreating in disarray. The guerrillas pursued and killed over 40 Japanese soldiers, and over 20 drowned while fleeing into the Pu River. Yesterday, the town was recaptured by the guerrillas, who also seized a large amount of Japanese supplies. After this severe blow from the guerrillas, the Japanese troops are on the verge of total collapse.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Hongkou Install Anti-Aircraft Guns</p>
<p>Rumors have been rampant in Hongkou recently. Some say that the Chinese Air Force will soon fly over Greater Shanghai to bomb the Japanese troops, while others say that numerous Chinese plainclothes soldiers have infiltrated and are active, numbering in the hundreds. The Japanese are extremely uneasy and yesterday added more anti-aircraft guns within the area to defend against Chinese aircraft bombing.</p>
<p>Giant Japanese Warship Enters the Huangpu River</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, amidst the dimming twilight, a giant Japanese cruiser entered the Huangpu River. The ship's hull was twice the size of the Izumo flagship. It had eight main gun emplacements fore and aft, sixteen anti-aircraft guns, and carried four aircraft. It docked at the China Merchants North Wharf. It is widely believed that the warship came to China to attack fortresses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Elects Chinese Members to Film Censorship Board</h3>
<p>HSBC's Chinese Manager</p>
<p>Mr. Gong Xingwu Has Been Appointed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Film Censorship Board for this year has now appointed Mr. Gong Xingwu as a Chinese member. Mr. Gong has served in the banking industry for many years and is currently the Chinese Manager of HSBC. He is enthusiastic about public welfare and has always been extremely concerned about social undertakings. His appointment to the Film Censorship Board will surely bring many contributions.</p>

<h3>German and Austrian Youths in Shanghai Flock to Enlist in British Army</h3>
<p>To Date, Not a Single One Has Enlisted</p>
<p>The Underlying Intention Can Be Guessed</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," among the German and Austrian refugees forced to leave Europe and come to Shanghai, dozens of young men have requested permission from the British authorities to join the British armed forces. Some have gone to the headquarters of the British Army in Shanghai on Dibble Road (now Huashan Road) to apply. The British Army told them to see consular officials. Others went directly to the British Consulate-General on the Bund. However, to date, not a single one has been enlisted. This morning (the 28th), an elderly German immigrant went to the British Army barracks on Dibble Road, wanting to see the commander. However, there is currently no British Army commander in Shanghai. Colonel Simonds, who has been appointed as the commander of the British Army in Shanghai, has not yet arrived. Therefore, he saw a responsible adjutant and made a simple request, saying that his son is six feet two inches tall and he wanted him to join the British Army. The adjutant told him to apply at the consulate. Before leaving, the German elder was asked why he wanted his son to join the British Army. The elder laughed and replied, "Soon he can fight Hitler!"</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppets Attempt to Dominate the Spring Cocoon Market in the Interior</h3>
<p>Harsh Regulations Limit Purchasing</p>
<p>Shanghai Factories Prepare to Negotiate</p>
<p>As the spring silk season approaches, the Japanese puppets, in an attempt to monopolize the silk market in the interior and prevent Chinese and foreign merchants from getting involved, have revised the "Regulations" set during last year's autumn cocoon season. All silk cocoons produced by civilians must first be traded through the cocoon collection "agencies" established by the "province" and "county," and direct buying and selling is prohibited. If factory owners want to purchase cocoons, they must first report the amount they want to buy and pay a deposit. They are not allowed to purchase directly from civilians. Currently, the Japanese puppets have established cocoon collection "agencies" in cocoon-producing areas in Zhejiang Province, such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou (Wuxing), and in Jiangsu Province, such as Kunshan, Wuxi, Suzhou (Wuxian), and Changshu, arbitrarily lowering market prices. However, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places are the origins of sericulture. Civilians all have their own drying stoves and can reel silk at any time. They are unwilling to be exploited by the Japanese puppets. However, due to the lack of such facilities in Suzhou, Changshu, and other places, they cannot store cocoons for long, so they are making great sacrifices.</p>
<p>Purchasing Difficulties Cause Anxiety for Factories</p>
<p>Shanghai's Chinese-owned silk reeling factories and foreign trading firms stationed in Shanghai, with the spring cocoon season about to begin, have sent personnel to various producing areas to conduct detailed investigations and to inquire about the Japanese puppets' methods for collecting cocoons. They have already returned to Shanghai one after another to report. The factories are quite anxious about the Japanese puppets changing the cocoon collection methods and revising the "Regulations." They originally planned to set up buying stations in the countryside to purchase cocoons, but this has been delayed because of this. Various Chinese and foreign factories and trading firms are currently engaged in joint consultations in order to discuss appropriate measures and negotiate with the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Chinese Silk Active in Overseas Markets</p>
<p>In the European and American silk markets, since our country's war of resistance began, international people have sympathized with us. Overseas silk markets that had long been seized by Japan have been affected by boycotts from various countries. Chinese silk has been exceptionally active. From August of last year until now, the amount of silk declared by the Shanghai Jianghai Customs to be shipped to Europe and America each month has increased by more than 30% compared to the previous one or two years. However, this week, sales have decreased slightly due to abundant inventories abroad.</p>
<h3>Assault on Chief Inspector Case: Protest Will Soon Be Lodged</h3>
<p>Liley Returned to Ship to Retrieve Pipe</p>
<p>Catastrophe Ensued on the Return Journey</p>
<p>Injuries to Western Officer and Mrs. Liley Are Improving</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," regarding the incident on the evening of April 24th in which Chief Inspector Samson of the Shanghai Municipal Police was assaulted by a Japanese Naval Landing Force major in the waiting room of the Country Hospital, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council received a detailed report on Wednesday night, along with eyewitness statements. The incident was studied by the Municipal Council directors yesterday and it is expected that a protest will soon be lodged with the Japanese authorities. This matter occurred after Liley, the principal of the Lester Training School, died in a car accident on Broadway Road. After Mrs. Liley and Western officer Wimsett of the Police Department were taken to the Country Hospital. Yesterday (the 27th), it was reported that Wimsett had a comfortable night and his condition was satisfactory. Mrs. Liley's condition has also greatly improved, but both are still unable to be questioned. Furthermore, according to the "Shanghai Times," after further investigation into the car accident on Broadway Road on Sunday night, the following facts have been confirmed: Liley disembarked from the Conte Verde liner in the afternoon. After returning home, he discovered that he had forgotten his pipe in his cabin on the ship. That evening, accompanied by Mrs. Liley, he drove back to the ship, which was docked next to the Hongkou Wharf. On the return to the city, he struck an obstacle on Broadway Bridge but did not stop. As they continued to drive, both Liley and his wife thought it would be best to drive back to the bridge to clear up any misunderstanding and avoid giving the impression that they had intentionally failed to stop when they should have. When they made this decision, they had already driven past the Garden Bridge. Seeing the Western officer Wimsett on duty, they explained the matter to him. Wimsett also thought it best to drive back and got into the car to accompany them. When they arrived at Broadway Bridge, they talked to the sentries from the unit stationed there for quite a while. After some time, Liley thought it was unnecessary to stay any longer and drove off. However, one of the Japanese sentries, believing that the matter had not been satisfactorily resolved, also boarded the running board of the car and interfered with the driver. The driver then tried to force the sentry off the car, likely swerving the car. While the car was turning at a bus stop, the two vehicles collided violently.</p>
<h3>New Portuguese Consul-General Takes Office</h3>

<h3>Famous Person Interview: Mr. Yu Qiaqing - The Spirit of Serving Society</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>His Life Devoted to Faithfulness, Trustworthiness, Diligence, and Thrift</p>
<p>Decades of Struggle Admired by Chinese and Foreigners</p>
<p>Old News Rehashed Reveals Shanghai's History</p>
<p>Organizing the Industrial Promotion Exposition</p>
<p>Since China's opening of five ports for trade in the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, our foreign trade has declined daily. The imported goods have increased daily, and the outflow of money is countless. I am very worried about this. I silently thought about the way to enrich the country. There is nothing better than developing commerce. We should open an industrial promotion exposition and promote it. Therefore, I widely publicized to the authorities and business people. At that time, Governor-General Duanfang of Liangjiang was one of the more enlightened Manchus. He strongly supported my statement, but fundraising was difficult. So, I first advanced 360,000 taels of silver, and the Ministry of Revenue allocated 700,000 taels of silver. The site was selected at Gulou in Nanjing. We began to construct the exposition site and the exhibition halls of various provinces, and built a light railway to connect the exposition site with Xiaguan for transportation. Duanfang was the chairman, and I was the vice-chairman. Just as we were actively proceeding, Duanfang was suddenly transferred to Beiyang. I was very worried. Given the situation in the officialdom at the time, it was truly "officials present, policies exist; officials gone, policies cease." If Duanfang left, the project would inevitably fail. So, I urgently consulted with Duanfang, telling him that the matter had been approved by the emperor, and there was no reason to stop it. The exposition lasted three months, and the products from all provinces were fully gathered. Two hundred thousand people attended the exposition. I initiated the industrial promotion exposition with the intention of using the exposition period to allow elites from various provinces and overseas Chinese from Nanyang to gather and exchange ideas and connect emotionally. Unexpectedly, Zhang Renjun succeeded Duanfang. Although he did not dare to openly oppose it due to imperial approval, he opposed me in every way. Later, the industrial promotion exposition was completed with a thousand difficulties.</p>
<p>The May 30th Massacre</p>
<p>At about 2 PM on May 30, 1925, an incident occurred in front of the Lao Zha Gate police station on Nanjing Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. Police officers shot students and workers, firing 44 shots. The order to fire was given by police chief Everson. Many were killed and wounded. This was followed by strikes and school boycotts, with huge losses. However, since the scope of the strikes was so large, the relief expenses were even greater. Although donations poured in from home and abroad, there was still a feeling of being overwhelmed. At that time, I was the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and I was at the forefront. Looking around at the internal and external situation, I felt that there was almost no way to continue. I worked tirelessly to cope with the situation, and then the serious situation gradually eased.</p>
<p>Joining the Chinese Board of Directors</p>
<p>Regarding participation in municipal affairs of the International Settlement, I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Municipal Council in February 1906, proposing the establishment of a Chinese Representative Committee. I believed that Chinese people had no right to participate in the municipal affairs of the settlement, which was an unfair treatment. This contradicted the proposal of the consular body in 1866 and the opinions published by the chairman of the Municipal Council in December of that year. Subsequently, the Municipal Council increased the municipal general tax from 1.2 to 1.4. Residents in the settlement rose up to organize the Joint Roads Association and established the Chinese Ratepayers Association to stand on equal footing with the Foreign Ratepayers Association in order to participate in municipal affairs. As a result of the negotiations, five advisory members were added. After the May 30th Massacre, the five advisors resigned. At that time, most foreigners gradually realized that municipal administration of the settlement could not be done without Chinese-foreign cooperation. Therefore, in 1926, the Municipal Council requested the relevant diplomatic authorities and the Chinese government to negotiate and approve the addition of three Chinese directors to the Municipal Council. Their powers were the same as those of the foreign directors. In 1927, the two settlements proposed to increase the municipal general tax by two percent. Protests erupted, and the French Concession peacefully resolved the matter first. However, the municipal authorities in the International Settlement did not fully understand the intentions of the Chinese people. For those who did not pay the increased tax, they prevented them from doing business, and as a result, 41 businesses closed. Since the Northern Expedition was in progress and the country was not yet unified, I came forward to mediate for the sake of maintaining the overall situation and the security of the settlement. I stipulated that the increased general tax be called "extra," paid under protest. At the same time, the addition of five Chinese directors and six committee members was a transition, and it was verbally agreed that the number of Chinese directors would be increased in the coming year. However, the Municipal Council was under pressure and could not immediately make recommendations to the relevant authorities. After two years of effort, on May 2, 1930, it finally achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The reporter recalled that, in order to commemorate Mr. Yu's contributions to the public welfare of the settlement, various Chinese and foreign circles in the International Settlement changed the name of Tibet Road, which runs north-south through the settlement, to Yu Qiaqing Road. This act is a lasting tribute to Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu was modest and said that the purpose of life is to serve, what is there to say? Later, I found a photograph taken at the Yu Qiaqing Road Naming Ceremony on October 1, 1936, which has not been seen by outsiders, and it is published to show Mr. Yu's great virtue, which is in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>As we chatted, many people came to visit Mr. Yu to discuss relief matters. The reporter thanked him and left. (End)</p>

<h3>Municipal Investment Bank Accepts Deposits</h3>
<p>Limited to Five Days, Fixed and Current Accounts Available</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Municipal Investment Bank will accept current account deposits from May 1st to 5th (Monday to Friday), with an annual interest rate of 5%. The receiving location is the public debt banking division of the Finance Department of the Secretary-General's office of the bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road (Room 257). The bank also accepts fixed deposits of six months and twelve months within the daily business hours, in accordance with the Municipal Council Proclamation No. 4911. The annual interest rate for a six-month fixed deposit is 5%, and for a twelve-month fixed deposit, it is 6%. Those who wish to inquire about details can contact the Finance Department of the bureau.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Municipal Government" Forcibly Sells Fake Flags</h3>
<p>Chinese-run shops in the Hongkou area of the International Settlement have recently been subjected to various harassments by the puppet municipal government. The merchants in that area feel pained because they are in the same settlement area, pay the same taxes, and yet suffer such ill-treatment. Last time, the puppet municipal government sent people to Hongkou to forcibly sell fake revenue stamps, which the Chinese shops unanimously refused. On the afternoon of the 27th, the puppet municipal government suddenly sent three thugs, one of whom was wearing a suit, was short in stature, and did not speak Chinese well. The other two, with threatening voices, forced the Hongkou shops to buy fake five-color flags and threatened to arrest those who did not buy them. It is heard that this matter is an attempt by the puppet regime to curry favor, but the shops are firmly refusing to buy them. The three quietly left.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council: All Tax Sources Show Improvement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Regular Income for the Past Year</p>
<p>License Fees and Property Taxes Have Increased</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's regular income for the past year has been excellent. The total amount actually received was 24,691,687 yuan, which is 2,525,007 yuan more than the budgeted figure, exceeding all previous records. The reasons for this include the sharp increase in population, which led to an increase in property taxes, and the rapid recovery of various industries and businesses within the International Settlement. All tax sources have improved. Last year, the bureau's land tax revenue was 8,0124,07 yuan, property tax revenue was 10,061,119 yuan within the settlement, 894,862 yuan in areas outside the settlement, license fee revenue was 3,003,761 yuan, bureau property rental revenue was 649,469 yuan, public and municipal business revenue was 1,848,779 yuan, and miscellaneous revenue was 57,835 yuan, all of which increased compared to the previous year (1937). Among these, the increase in license fees and property taxes was the most significant. The only items that decreased last year were the special advertising tax of 20,714 yuan and the wharf tax of 142,741 yuan.</p>

<h3>After Chen Caifu's Defection, Japanese Monitor Lu Ying</h3>
<p>Japanese Suspect Lu of Colluding with Chen</p>
<p>Hu Zhenggu Shaves His Head to Become a Monk</p>
<p>According to the Nationalities Society, after the false surrender and defection of Chen Caifu's troops in Haimen, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, so they are thoroughly investigating this matter. It was then learned that when Chen's troops falsely surrendered, Lu Ying, the head of the puppet police station, acted as a go-between. They suspected Lu of colluding, so from the previous day, the Japanese Military Police sent several plainclothes special agents to follow and monitor him, so his movements have been restricted. Lu's followers are currently running around to plead his case. It is also learned that Hu Zhenggu, the protagonist of the Pudong Terror Case, which was created by Lu Ying, has been unheard of since he was detained by the Japanese Military Police. It is now learned that Hu has been exiled to Peiping and has shaved his head to become a monk in a temple.</p>
<h3>Death of Professor Barhydt of St. John's University</h3>
<p>Dr. Barhydt, former professor at St. John's University in Shanghai, passed away on the 12th of this month from heart disease in Seattle, USA. Friends and students in China were saddened by the news. Professor Barhydt was deeply knowledgeable and had been a professor of political science and history at St. John's University for many years. He never tired of teaching, and many students were influenced by him. He later returned to the United States and became a professor at the University of Washington. In addition to teaching, he was diligent in writing. His book "A Diplomatic History of China" won an award from an American academic society, which shows how much he was valued. He usually wrote articles for magazines and gave radio speeches, often expressing his deep sympathy for China. His passing is not only the loss of a giant star in the academic world, but also the loss of a good friend in China. What a pity.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Changes Office Hours</h3>

German expatriates in this city who do not have radios have received invitations to gather at the Garden Club. It is expected that shortly after the German head of state delivers his speech, the Berlin shortwave radio station will broadcast an English translation of the speech.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Baoshang Bank Forced to Close: Statement from the Issuance Reserve Committee</h3>
<p>The Bank's Reserve Fund Only Reached 10 Percent</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Urged Payment But it Was Never Made</p>
<p>After the Beiyang Baoshang Bank was forcibly closed and liquidated by the Japanese, the Issuance Reserve Management Committee issued a statement stating that the amount of reserve fund submitted to the Reserve Committee by the bank was only 10% of the bank's issuance amount. The Ministry urged payment but it was never made. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issuance Reserve Committee Issues Statement</p>
<p>The Beiyang Baoshang Bank was established in 1908 with the advocacy of the Governor-General of Beiyang and was not established until 1910. The initial authorized capital was 4 million taels, which was later changed to a limited company. The paid-in capital was 1,129,500 yuan. The general manager was Wang Kemin. The head office was located in Peiping, and there was a branch in Tianjin. The banknotes issued by the bank that were circulating in the market amounted to 3 million yuan as of the end of last year. It has now been forcibly closed by the Japanese and is being liquidated. It is falsely claimed that the reserve fund has been paid to the Ministry of Finance, which is ignored.</p>
<p>Issuance Reserve Committee Issues Statement</p>
<p>The Issuance Reserve Management Committee issued a statement saying that it has been reported that the Beiyang Baoshang Bank in Tianjin has been forcibly closed and liquidated by the Japanese, and it is claimed that the banknotes issued by the bank and its reserve fund have been received by the Ministry of Finance. After investigation, the issuance reserve of the bank was received by this committee according to the letter of the Ministry of Finance. So far, the amount of reserve fund submitted by the bank is only 10% of the total issuance amount. Repeatedly urged, the payment was never made. The bank's publicity is obviously instructed by the Japanese and intends to confuse the public. In addition to reporting to the Ministry for verification, this is hereby announced to the public.</p>

<h3>The Perils of Gambling Run Deep: Servant Gambles Away and Turns Thief</h3>
<p>Stealing over two thousand yuan worth of belongings from his master</p>
<p>Two accomplices apprehended and brought to court for prosecution</p>
<p>Xu Yinbao (also known as Deming), a Western employee at the residence of Mr. Mai Tuo, a Westerner residing at 383 Daxilu, Shanghai West, is a young, frivolous individual. In his spare time, he would frequently visit various gambling dens in the Caojiadu area, indulging in dice games. However, he consistently lost, and each time he did, he would return to steal his master's belongings. This behavior was not a one-time occurrence. Around the beginning of the previous month, Xu, realizing the extent of his thefts and fearing discovery</p>
<p>and inescapable punishment, deserted his post and fled. After Xu's departure, the Westerner conducted an inspection and estimated that the stolen ornaments and money amounted to a substantial two thousand three hundred yuan, including a defensive handgun that was also taken. Xu's father, also employed as a Western servant in the same residence, subsequently received Chinese and Western letters from Xu, confessing the reason for his theft and escape.</p>
<p>Mai Tuo, acting on this information, reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple police station, which then requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant for Xu Yinbao. A few days ago, Xu's father learned of his son's whereabouts and immediately informed the police, who dispatched detectives to the vicinity of Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road, where they apprehended Yinbao. According to his testimony, Gu Shicheng, a local resident living at 55, Lane 245, Pushi Road in the French Concession,</p>
<p>was an accomplice in the crime and shared the stolen goods. Furthermore, Gu was responsible for disposing of the handgun. Consequently, the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case proceeded to Gu's residence to arrest him. However, Gu attempted to escape by climbing onto the roof, fearing punishment. He was eventually captured. Yesterday morning, both were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Zhong Qing conducted the preliminary hearing. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, presented the previous case, stating that further investigation was needed</p>
<p>to recover the stolen goods and requested an extension for the interrogation. Xu confessed that due to gambling losses, he conspired with Gu to commit the theft, and Gu helped dispose of the stolen items. He also admitted that Gu wrote the letters to his master and father. However, Gu vehemently denied all accusations. Subsequently, the court ordered Xu and Gu to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Zhao Rusheng, a thirty-year-old man from Qingjiang, runs a steamed bun shop at 11 Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road. Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, Xu Guangting (30 years old) from Shandong came to buy two steamed buns. For reasons unknown, a verbal dispute erupted. After some time people came in to resolve the matter, only for it to die down. Shortly after, Xu gathered twenty to thirty people, including Xu Jinsheng, to seek revenge. Brandishing sharp blades and iron rods, they surrounded Zhao and his employee, Gao Bingsheng (39 years old, from Qingjiang), and began to brutally beat them. Zhao's wife seized the opportunity to escape and called for help in the nearby area. Soon after, several people armed with wooden sticks and kitchen knives rushed to join the fray. The resulting brawl caused injuries on both sides. Zhao Rusheng, the owner, sustained four knife wounds to the head, one to the left hand, and one to the right arm, leaving him in critical condition. Gao Bingsheng suffered injuries to his left arm and back. On the opposing side, Xu Jinquan (25 years old, from Yangzhou) received a knife wound to the head, Liu Yonghai (28 years old, from Shandong) suffered injuries to his head and hands, Sun Fusheng (28 years old, from Qingjiang) sustained a knife wound to his left hand, and Xu Guangting (30 years old, from Shandong) suffered a knife wound to the back of his head. In total, there were six injured individuals. Subsequently, the local police from districts 140, 3354, and 329, along with Indian constables, arrived at the scene. The remaining perpetrators scattered in all directions. The six injured were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder at Xizilaihuo Street Last Night</h3>
<p>Three Robbers Force Open the Back Door of Fuchang Pawnshop</p>
<p>Killing the Accountant and Stealing Valuables</p>
<p>Fuchang Pawnshop at 122 Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession, owned by Ye Xiangxing from Dongting East Mountain, Suzhou, has been in business for many years. The pawnshop had an accountant named Tang Shenglin, 28 years old, who was from the same hometown as the owner. At 10:45 last night, three thugs, two dressed in long robes and one in short attire, arrived at the pawnshop. They claimed to be redeeming important items and repeatedly knocked on the back door. Jiang Haoqing, a teenage apprentice from Changzhou, opened the door. The three men rushed in. Tang Shenglin was at the counter, settling the accounts. Without any explanation, one of the men dragged Jiang the apprentice upstairs and gagged him with cloth. The other two dragged Tang Shenglin to a small room behind the reception hall and repeatedly stabbed him with knives. Tang was unable to resist and suffered more than ten stab wounds to the head, dying instantly. The thugs stole over one hundred yuan in paper money and silver dollars from the counter</p>
<p>and a gold ring. They escaped through the back door and disappeared without a trace. It was not until the other employees returned to the shop that they discovered the horrific crime. They immediately reported the incident to the police. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the scene. After questioning the apprentice and other employees, they learned that one of the three men had come to the shop yesterday (the day before) afternoon, claiming that he had an electric fan that had reached its expiration date and that he wanted to add two yuan in interest to extend the redemption period. He said that he would return the next day (yesterday) to redeem it. The apprentice recognized him as the man who had come to add interest and opened the door without suspicion, never expecting that they would come to commit murder and robbery. After questioning, the detectives transported the body to the mortuary for examination and reported the case to the Second Special District Court. They also took the apprentice to the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Intellectual Youths Impersonate [Organizations] in Shanghai to Commit Fraud; Special Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>Numerous crimes warrant further investigation</p>
<p>Qi Rengzhang, president of the China News Agency, along with Chen Xueming, Zhu Shaoliang, Liu Liansheng, Zhang Xingzhi, Peng Jiangtian, and others, after the westward movement of the National Revolutionary Army, seized the opportunity to impersonate the Shanghai Third Brigade, Eighth Detachment of the Three People's Principles Youth League. They printed various materials and defrauded people from all walks of life,</p>
<p>deceiving countless victims. Recently, they approached Yang Xueqiao, the owner of Yang Dingyuan Cotton Mill at 20 Jinlong Street, accusing him of serving as the "Chairman of the Maintenance Society" in Qibao Town, attempting to extort four thousand yuan. Yang reported the matter to the Central Police Station, and Chinese detectives Wang Chengying, Jiang Shangpei, and Yang Peisheng apprehended Qi and the other six suspects. They were sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. The details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the criminal</p>
<p>court to continue the hearing. Yang Xueqiao also hired lawyer Li Weibin to file a lawsuit, refuting the accusations that his client was the "Chairman of the Maintenance Society" in Qibao Town. He stated that Yang had fled to Jiaoli shortly after the war and then came to Shanghai. He never participated in any puppet organizations or engaged in traitorous activities. Furthermore, Yang was a legitimate businessman who served as the chairman of the Qibao Town Chamber of Commerce and would never</p>
<p>degrade himself by colluding with the enemy to shame the nation and its people. He requested that this be clarified. Subsequently, police lawyer Ru Baoheng stated that due to the numerous crimes committed by the defendants, it was difficult to investigate everything at once. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the hearing again to allow for a thorough investigation before merging all the charges. The court then summoned Sha Jintang, who carved the seals for the defendants, and Chen Jianming, who printed the letters, to testify. The two men testified that</p>
<p>Peng Jiangtian and Zhu Shaoliang commissioned them to carve the seals and print the letters. At the time, they did not suspect any deceit and therefore agreed to provide their services. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, requested the court's permission for the defendants to be released on bail. Judge Feng stated that due to the seriousness of the case, he could not grant the request at this time and ordered a postponement for a special hearing.</p>

<h3>The Skill and Awkwardness of Diplomatic Tactics</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>In this recent stage, the skill and awkwardness of international diplomatic tactics can be clearly compared.</p>
<p>Let's start with Roosevelt's inquiry to Hitler and Mussolini. This inquiry can certainly be included in the scope of diplomacy. However, it did not go through the usual diplomatic channels, with officials in charge of diplomacy taking responsibility, but instead, the head of one country directly inquired with the head of another country. This is a new record in diplomacy, and the attitude is bright, the meaning is serious, and it is incomparable to general diplomatic rhetoric, so its value exceeds the general diplomatic methods, and we cannot criticize it for skill or awkwardness.</p>
<p>However, the international diplomatic repercussions that followed this thunderous sound can be judged at will.</p>
<p>Mussolini's reaction was awkward. He gave a speech that was empty and irrelevant to Roosevelt, and everyone could see that he was at a loss for words. Some say that because he knew he was not an important figure, he simply went through the motions, and the grand finale would be sung by Hitler, which may be correct.</p>
<p>Hitler's reaction was skillful. He did not respond directly, nor did he rush to give a speech, but instead racked his brains and came up with the idea of turning to the smaller countries to ask whether they were being threatened by Germany. In this way, he could not only delay the reply, but also use the replies of the smaller countries, which he expected to be favorable to himself, to talk nonsense with Roosevelt and avoid being embarrassed. But this approach of his has been unanimously ridiculed by international opinion, and even if it is skillful, it is also nonsense.</p>
<p>The smaller countries' replies to Hitler, of course, cannot be judged for their skill or awkwardness, because as most people say, civilians under the guns of thugs, and schoolchildren under the coercion of naughty children, have no freedom to reply, so although their replies are extremely awkward, we can only leave them unsaid.</p>
<p>Romania's reply was the most skillful! She said that Romania's existence under threat from Germany was something Romania did not know, and that the question should be asked of Germany itself. "Using the spear of the son to pierce the shield of the son," "using the way of the other to treat the other," "please enter the urn," these idioms can all be transferred to the diplomatic authorities of Romania. However, some say that Romania's wonderful words are prompted by the confidence of having no fear: I am afraid that it is only a "scholar meets a soldier, and there is no way to reason."</p>
<p>The return of the British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, can be said to be the most awkward of diplomatic tactics. I have already said this, so I will not discuss it again. And the German government's treatment of Henderson can be said to be skillful in awkwardness. In order to preempt Henderson's actions, it simply refused to see him, which was awkward; but by making Henderson unable to use his skills and unable to see his own words, it gained the victory, which was skillful.</p>
<p>Diplomacy must be backed by force, but skillful diplomacy can often exceed force in its success, which is what is meant by "not leaving the feast, but defeating the enemy thousands of miles away." The current government authorities still seem to need to pay attention to diplomacy.</p>
<h3>The Drifter</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>It was an evening filled with flying sand, when we arrived at our destination, Dangshan County in northwestern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>A long, iron mass, snaked forward, its thousands of human figures wriggling in the twilight, treading on soft, powdery soil; one shadow pressed against another, linking together to form an endless iron Great Wall, its tail hidden beyond sight.</p>
<p>To reduce the target, this iron torrent flowed into each village, scattering into various places that could echo each other.</p>
<p>I was a staff member of a certain unit. There were twenty-some of us, and we found a place to rest at Ji Zhuang, a village about two li from Dangshan City. Our preliminary work was launched in this ancient and sincere village.</p>
<p>The common people did not cast horrified glances at the gray shadows, but rather revealed excitement on each simple face; even the elderly would come with their crutches, extending warm greetings as if to their own sons. What they possessed was a joyful heart, which could be discerned from each clear and rapid breath.</p>
<p>News spread quite quickly in the village. Within less than half an hour of our arrival, the threshing ground was filled with dozens of innocent children, all of school age. Each child raised their head, eyes wide open, blinking rapidly; they made no sound, paying attention, listening to every unfamiliar movement and every unfamiliar word of our group, concentrating as if listening to a teacher telling a fairy tale in the classroom. Here, we examined each of their lovely faces, how deeply they were imprinted in our minds.</p>
<p>We began to chat haphazardly in the national language. They seemed a little strange about our changing to another language, but they understood our words without difficulty, and quickly shifted their bodies into casual poses. In the dim starlight, their faces were vaguely visible, blushing, and their eyes sparkled with a crystalline light, appearing even more excited; they vied to answer the questions we asked.</p>
<p>There was no strangeness, no timidity. We were as close as brothers reunited after a long separation.</p>
<p>They told us that they were still studying at a village elementary school less than two li away, and they were not shaken in their determination by the threat of gunfire. They told us their names, and the older children even spoke of the simple meaning of resolute resistance, which they had gleaned from their teacher’s memory.</p>
<p>So we suggested a few songs that everyone generally knew and asked them to sing along with us; they understood simple rounds and also knew how to watch the movements of my hand to determine the pitch and tempo of the sound.</p>
<p>Sharp singing reverberated throughout this quiet village.</p>
<p>Children, adults, men, and women flowed into a vast sea of people. The adults wanted to call the children in for dinner, but they were drawn in by the singing, unable to speak their words, and the children forgot their hunger. The magnificent singing spread through the fields, penetrating deep into everyone's heart. (Fundraising Through Sales)</p>
<h3>Rebirth at the End of the Century</h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>One,</p>
<p>The doomsday</p>
<p>Cometh;</p>
<p>The decayed</p>
<p>Corpse of the old world</p>
<p>Is waving to you!</p>
<p>Two,</p>
<p>In Asia,</p>
<p>A hesitant giant</p>
<p>Has stood up!</p>
<p>Towering on the top of high mountains,</p>
<p>Like an ancient sage,</p>
<p>Awe-inspiringly</p>
<p>Standing tall!</p>
<p>Three,</p>
<p>The wind is swirling!</p>
<p>The rain is bursting!</p>
<p>Nurtured in the interplay of light and heat,</p>
<p>The century bestows new life again.</p>
<h3>The Three Stages of</h3>
<h3>The First Deployment</h3>
<p>— Ren Linrui</p>
<p>Early autumn, the weather was still very hot, and the cotton cultivated and grown by the earth, the plump white flowers, had long been picked by the local farmers, as a reward for their hard work during the year that they valued, leaving only withered branches, scattered all over this desolate field.</p>
<p>There were no mountains, but there were earthen burial mounds, protruding from the fields, as if managing everything for the vast field.</p>
<p>There were several small rivers that were not wide, but they could lead you to the famous Tang Family Ancestral Hall here, and they could also ferry you to the shore, into the vast, dark, deep green bamboo forest. Now, during the day, you could often see garrisoned soldiers here, waving to you, sailing in sharp-headed boats, rowing single sculls very easily.</p>
<p>The Second Public Hospital for Wounded Soldiers was set up in a public elementary school in the countryside, with rescue teams sent from the Shanghai Red Cross providing service inside. The hospital was extremely quiet, and the bedding used by the wounded soldiers was mostly brought in person by the common people.</p>
<p>We often went to this hospital because the Boy Scouts also had to do rescue work. The road was very difficult to walk when carrying wounded soldiers, and we had to walk along the narrow paths between the fields, but we were not used to walking there, so we eventually walked along the banks of the small river. The small river was beautiful, and the small river was our compass.</p>
<p>There were only twenty or so village houses near the public hospital in the fields, all old and dilapidated, which were the only houses here, and several of our comrades lived there.</p>
<p>It was already getting cool at night, and the moon shone on the fields. Looking out, there were no lights, only the silvery gray of the moon, covering the fields.</p>
<p>Old Gu—he was older than me and taller than me—and I went on sentry duty together. He carried a rifle and several rows of bullets on his back.</p>
<p>Although I felt a bit cold, we were willing to accept this duty, and we patrolled the fields.</p>
<p>Two strong men in front of us answered us—the password for the night—and immediately hurried over to tell us that someone seemed to be sending signals behind the burial mound ahead, and the green flames were quickly released into the sky.</p>
<p>I took the gun bayonet from Old Gu's hand; the four of us quickly dispersed to surround this dangerous burial mound. I felt a bit hesitant, a bit scared. But catching people, ah! I stepped on the grass and quickly circled around.</p>
<p>"Nothing!" When we encountered each other after running around in a circle, we all uttered the same strange sound.</p>
<p>After dismissing the strong men, we hid nearby with vigilant hearts, aiming the muzzles of our guns at the burial mound just now.</p>
<p>The cool night was silent, and there were only our two breaths here.</p>
<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The manuscripts for fundraising and donation are very much approved by this journal. Please indicate at the end of the manuscript, and we will follow through. This may indeed be a way for isolated island literati to serve the country. We hope that everyone will participate enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>The Art of Pulling</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>To give without receiving is not proper; therefore: to push without pulling is not beneficial. Moreover, pushing is always a passive action of preventing trouble before it happens and removing trouble after it has already happened, unlike pulling, where everything that is beneficial to oneself is pulled, which is a thorough and authentic active action. Therefore, the relationship between pulling and pushing is like that between a wolf and a werwolf, inseparable, and it also has independent value, and it is impossible not to learn it!</p>
<p>The first skill in pulling is naturally pulling people. For example, if you want to become an official, you must learn to win people over; the items in winning people over include: inviting them to eat, inviting them to stroll, inviting them to play; paying homage to teachers; establishing ties through marriage, establishing ties through godparentage; recognizing people from the same hometown, recognizing classmates, recognizing relationships through generations; giving gifts; paying respects at the yamen; big wives, small wives, sisters, or any women, going through internal channels; ... each item, when studied carefully, is enough to become a special book; nothing is difficult in the world, only fear of those who have a mind to do it, this is passed over without mention here.</p>
<p>If you want to get rich, you must learn to win over directors. Because the most convenient way to get rich, in addition to becoming an official, is to start a company, open a store, or organize a factory. These avenues, as long as you can win over first-class directors who are wealthy and reputable, second-class directors who are wealthy but not reputable, and third-class directors who are not wealthy but reputable, and they elect you as manager, open branches, stores, and factories, and make you general manager, you can make a great fortune. If the company develops and there are indeed profits, of course you can make a great fortune; if it does not develop, or even loses money, or even goes bankrupt, you can still make a great fortune, because stirring up troubled waters to catch fish has always been a secret method passed down, and the formula is that the shareholders are wiped out, while the managers or general managers are well-fed.</p>
<p>In addition to winning over directors, of course winning over shareholders is also important. But with the directors above being sufficient to rally people, the shareholders will respond to the news and it will not be a problem.</p>
<p>If you say that the directors are elected by the shareholders, how can you win them over, then I must say to you: Stupid child, you cannot be taught, you must study hard! Because elections are just formalities, pulling is the reality!</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to starting companies, some people have had a whimsical idea that opening schools is also a good way to make money, so you must also work hard to learn about pulling related to opening schools.</p>
<p>First, you must also know how to win over directors; the qualifications of the directors are exactly the same as those of all companies. Second, you must know how to win over teachers: teachers who can lecture and attract students must be won over; black teachers who are able to work hard, are inexpensive, help me get rich, are clean, and do not think of getting involved must especially be won over. Third, you must know how to win over students: the principle is that no one who comes is refused, and the more the better; the slogan is that our school has thirty-six subjects, all of which are complete, to meet the various needs of students; or we post advertisements in newspapers, or paste posters, or distribute leaflets, or even hire touts or use brokers as means.</p>
<p>It is said that the principal is a leader in the cultural world. In our country that values literature, the reputation is even better than that of a manager or general manager, and the wealth is at least about the same as that of a manager or general manager. It seems that on the point of gaining both fame and fortune, the principal's pulling is even more important to learn skillfully than the manager's or general manager's pulling.</p>
<p>The second skill in pulling is probably pulling credit. This pulling is exactly the opposite of pushing.</p>
<p>On a small scale: when playing soccer with others and winning, you roar to the crowd: Fortunately, that kick of mine determined the outcome; old brother, you defecated without toilet paper, if I didn't have waste paper on me to provide you with a convenience, you wouldn't be able to stand up; ... even the cook who boils water will come up with a "ugly self-praise." On a large scale: lower-level clerks and workers go out to shops and factories, working hard and sparing no effort. Once they get rich, when dividing the dividends, they are split into seventeen shares, and what they get is a few percent of one share, while the manager or general manager gets several shares alone; white-robed junior generals and fire-headed soldiers conquer cities and seize territory, and kill generals and capture flags, all of which are credited by Zhang Shigui to his dog-in-law He Zongxian; ... even the heads of a country, who routinely oppress the people and are capable of bullying the weak, then when giving speeches, call themselves the saviors of the people and the protectors of peace. In short, "all the bad things that go wrong, that suffer losses, and that are detrimental are pushed onto others," while all the smooth, beautiful things that increase fame, status, and income are pulled onto oneself.</p>
<p>"One pull after another seems to require "three pulls" to be a happy ending." However, there is actually too much to learn for three pulls, and it goes beyond the circle of a happy ending. Now I can only briefly mention a few types to make it a tail of a snake.</p>
<p>A person who pulls manuscripts to be an editor must learn this skill: when there is a shortage of manuscripts, there will be manuscripts, and when the manuscripts are of poor quality, there will be good manuscripts. Generally, when there is no money, there is only bowing and scraping, and clever means of seizing; when there is money, then what is drawn from here is poured over there, or what is thin there is thickened here. The former is a young junior, beautifully named a new writer; the latter is an old brand-name writer, beautifully named an advanced figure in the literary world.</p>
<p>A person who makes a living by pulling strings on the Shanghai Bund must learn this skill:—</p>
<p>A person who pulls customers, often prostitutes—</p>
<p>Enough, if I keep pulling, it will become unrecognizable. I'll stop here and not pull anymore.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Diplomacy and Goryeo</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from April of the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Japan wanted China to assist each other. Because China had signed a treaty with Goryeo, if they were attacked by another country, China would use troops to assist. Since there was a previous agreement, this one was difficult to establish. Upon hearing this news, Japan immediately sent an imperial envoy and the Goryeo consul stationed in Shanghai to Beijing to discuss establishing a new agreement. Japan's desire to establish this agreement was extremely clever, because they knew that they were on bad terms with Goryeo and were about to start a war. If they could get China's military assistance, they would definitely be able to win.</p>
<h3>Centenarian Woman</h3>
<p>Your subject, Li Hongzhang, respectfully reports: "Regarding a centenarian woman who has lived to be nearly 100 years old, who has personally witnessed seven generations and five generations living under one roof, please issue an edict of commendation and request Your Majesty's sacred review: Your subject has received a report from the gentlemen of Baoding Prefecture, including Zhang Qirui, stating that Wang Du, the mother of Wang Zhengang, a Jinshi from Xincheng County, is currently 94 years old and has served Zhengang's great-grandfather and grandfather.

<h3>Chess Match Over a Thousand Li</h3>
<p>The art of chess was formerly named "hand talk" by the ancients, because a single move against each other can determine victory or defeat without words. Therefore, even Yi Qiu (Note: a person's name, see Mencius), who was known as a national master, had never been able to enjoy the pleasures of this game without observing his opponent's face. (Note: In the orange garden of Bayin, after the frost, the oranges are as big as jars. When opened, there are two old men playing chess inside. See Youguai Lu for the story.) It was not expected that there would be two cities in New Gold Mountain, one called Sydney and the other called Adelaide, which are very far apart. There are two chess players who live in each city and use the telegraph to transmit chess moves, making it as if they were in the same room.</p>

<h3>We Request Mr. Chu Minyi to Give a Speech</h3>
<p>Since Chairman Jiang launched the Spiritual Mobilization, all parts of the country have responded, and various departments have actively launched work. In newspapers and magazines, everyone is discussing the implementation methods of spiritual mobilization, and everyone is talking about the importance of spiritual mobilization. Spiritual mobilization has already begun to be recognized as a universally important task.</p>
<p>We are students, an important part of the nation, so naturally we should also do it, and do it very actively.</p>
<p>It was Friday when our student union convened a delegate meeting to implement the Spiritual Mobilization. We invited our principal and director of discipline to guide us.</p>
<p>The meeting began. The chairman reported on the meaning of the meeting, explained the importance of the Spiritual Mobilization, and asked the students whether they wanted to organize a Spiritual Mobilization Committee.</p>
<p>"The Spiritual Mobilization was launched by our supreme leader, and all citizens must implement it, so we should implement it without doubt, and there is no need for a vote!" This was the words of our principal, resolute, heroic, and accurate.</p>
<p>Secondly, we mentioned wartime education, because this is very important. The Third National Education Conference rigorously discussed and planned: to learn wartime skills and understand wartime theories during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is an important issue, and I feel that anti-war education is not only important during wartime, but also should be prepared for during peacetime; I think that regarding the current issues, Chinese can read stories of national heroes and the speeches of national leaders, and civics can talk more about current affairs." This was the director of discipline speaking. He completely agreed with our proposal, and the principal urged students to buy more reference books as supplementary materials.</p>
<p>"Regarding wartime education, I have some opinions, which is to hope that teachers of all levels and subjects can have regular gatherings, in which the student union can send students to participate, where they can regularly discuss how to make the textbooks they teach cooperate with the anti-war effort, and what kind of teaching methods are suitable for the anti-war effort? I think that this will definitely be more helpful and more certain for the implementation of anti-war education." This was the opinion of a high school student, and it was a very good opinion. The principal and director of discipline both agreed, and the students also approved.</p>
<p>Afterwards, in order to thoroughly implement the Spiritual Mobilization, and in order to truly love our school, we raised the issue of our chairman, Mr. Chu Minyi. Because Mr. Chu is a relative of Wang Jingwei, and was also Wang Jingwei's secretary in the past, after Wang Jingwei betrayed the country and the nation, Mr. Chu was greatly noticed, and the rumors about our school from the outside world also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>This issue immediately sparked a heated discussion. Some advocated asking him to make a statement in the newspaper, some advocated asking him to come to the school to give a speech, some advocated asking the directors, some... Our conclusion from the discussion was: first, ask the principal to write a letter to Mr. Chu, asking him to set a date, when we students would go to visit him once, for the sake of loving our school with 37 years of glorious history, loving our chairman, and also for our own sake. During this visit, we would ask Mr. Chu to make a statement in the newspaper to express his attitude, so that students would have a deeper understanding of him, and faith; Secondly, ask Mr. Chu to come to the school to give a speech, either about the National Spiritual Mobilization or about Wang Jingwei, we believe that Mr. Chu would not refuse.</p>
<p>The proposal was passed in this enthusiastic agreement from the teachers and approval from the students. At the same time, the delegate meeting also came to an end.</p>
<p>This was last week's matter. This week, our Spiritual Mobilization Committee will hold its inaugural meeting, and it is scheduled for May ×, when all of our students will take an oath, and on that day, the school has agreed to invite Mr. Chu to give a speech and lead the oath.</p>
<p>This is how the Spiritual Mobilization in our school is being done, but a large part of the reason why it can be done well is because of the help of the principal and the director of discipline.</p>
<p>We hope that students in other schools will also launch the Spiritual Mobilization, and we hope that the principals and directors of discipline in other schools can also actively help students as they do in our school!</p>

<h3>Impressions of "The Oklahoma Kid"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“The Oklahoma Kid”</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Bros.</p>
<p>Screened at Grand Cathay Cinema</p>
<p>The sensational "G-Men" created a new line for American films to compete in filming G-Men, and James Cagney's name was as great as that of Edward G. Robinson. But since "G-Men", there have been hardly any better films, which is more like saying that it is difficult to follow up under a great reputation than to say that speculation will eventually lead to failure. A few months ago, I heard that James Cagney had a new work in Shanghai that surpassed "G-Men", translated as "A Generation of Heroes", but until now, we cannot meet it. If I'm not mistaken, it must be because the heroism of killing and arson is too terrible. The current "The Oklahoma Kid" still maintains the past style and does not have any special achievements.</p>
<p>The story tells that in 1893, when the U.S. government opened up the state of Oklahoma, Dan Kincaid and his son Ned were also among the immigrants, but when they arrived at the land they claimed, it had already been occupied by the famous gambler McCord (Humphrey Bogart). Dan, in order to quell the matter, was unwilling to litigate and worked hard to manage the land, gradually making this desolate land prosper. The residents were grateful for Dan's virtue and intended to elect him as mayor. The gambler, fearing that Dan would seize power once he held power, which would be detrimental to him, framed Dan for murder, put him in prison, kidnapped the judge, and instigated his subordinates to sentence Dan to death. James Cagney plays Dan's son, who has been wandering outside all year round. In order to avenge his father, he eliminated the three evils alone.</p>
<p>This is naturally another film full of heroism. When he eliminated the three evils, he held double guns and succeeded immediately, but in the end, when he wrestled with McCord, he finally succeeded with the help of his brother Ned's shot. Here, the screenwriter has too neglected the importance of cooperation and the power of the masses. Since the masses put Dan to death under McCord's instigation, then in the face of justice, they will definitely be more powerful in eliminating the conspiracy of evil forces. Therefore, when James persuades Dan to break out of prison, he is determined that justice must be done.</p>
<p>Ned's girlfriend, Jane (Rosemary Lane), finally married James. I think the insertion of this romance is also very forced.</p>
<p>The cameraman of this film is James Wong Howe. It is good to use various angles to capture the hooves and wheels when the immigrant cars and horses set off, and the picture is also beautiful.</p>
<h3>Service Spirit?</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Dingqi</p>
<h3>Beggars</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Beggars are the most annoying things. Suppose you are walking on the sidewalk, no matter which road you walk on, there will be a ragged wretch following behind you, constantly shouting, "Open your golden hand, and you will live to ninety-nine," "The more you give, the more you will be blessed, and you will open several pawnshops next year," "Do good deeds, and you will raise a big fat son next year," "What goes out in the light comes back in the dark, and you will make millions," if you pay attention, you will always be able to hear several wretch gentlemen complimenting you with so many good words.</p>
<p>Suppose you are modern grandmothers, ladies, and young ladies, they will be even more eager to follow you. The faster you walk, the faster they will follow you, and they will also shout humorously: "Grandmother, lady. Please, young masters and old lords," grandmothers, ladies, and young ladies see the wretches following behind, and there is also a special and rarely smelled odor from the wind, which is disgusting, and they may even play pranks and bring a few strong and yesteryear old white worms over, which is really unbearable. It is better to give them a few coppers and let them go. Such beggars are indeed extremely hateful, but they are also the "threshold" for them to ask for money.</p>
<p>There are also a few old-timers of beggars. If they have been chasing for a while and you do not give them money, they will scold "Chilao," "You will be like me one day," they also have a malicious term for begging for food, called "driving pigs." Some people give them money and still count them as pigs, isn't it hateful? I once heard old-timer A ask old-timer B, how many pigs did you drive today? Old-timer B replied, today I met "Chilao" and didn't get much money. They really make a good profit from this business without any capital, so some people say that after being a beggar for three years, even the emperor doesn't want to be, and there is some truth to this.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, being a beggar is because they are poor, have no food to eat, and are unemployed, unable to find work, so they beg for food. After all, they do not rob or threaten people. It is good if passers-by are willing to give them money, and they can't do anything if passers-by don't give them money. Although they are not good for the country and society, they are not very bad either, so some people say: "A beggar who throws away his stick is a good person," but there are friends who sell their souls and traitors who sell out their nation. Although they do not beg for food, they still live in Western-style houses and drive cars, but their "lasting fame" cannot be erased forever. It can be said that all the waters of the West River cannot wash away their evil names, and all the bamboos of the South Mountain cannot record their crimes. Such people can be said to have no heart or liver.</p>
<h3>Rain After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Enduring Sorrow and Swallowing Bitterness, Tears Sprinkle the Four Walls; Practicing Thrift and Labor, Diligently Tending Ten Acres</p>
<p>Later, she discussed a business plan with Jin Danyu. After consulting with several of her old Chinese friends, they found this enterprise very novel. Everyone was willing to invest. Apart from Mrs. Surya, who took half the shares herself, amounting to 1.5 million national currency, the others eagerly subscribed for shares, exceeding 3 million yuan. Mrs. Surya said, "We are still in the trial phase. If people are happy to use these cars, we can expand to the whole of China. The capital required will be many times more. Since everyone is willing to invest, let's assume the company's capital is 5 million yuan. We will collect six percent first and start the trial operation." In addition to this, Mrs. Surya collaborated with Chinese friends to open a pharmaceutical company. Mrs. Surya had traveled to the interior of China and saw that the people there paid too little attention to hygiene. The emerging China is indeed vast in territory and population. Although it pays great attention to public health, its strength is insufficient. Mrs. Surya's pharmaceutical company is not like those in China before the war, which "advertise genuine prescriptions and sell fake medicines," or spend "one point on medicine, one point on packaging, and seven points on advertising." She offers genuine goods at fair prices, hoping to benefit the general public. She has made arrangements with various hospitals. Sometimes she funds the pharmaceutical company to produce medicines, which she personally donates to small hospitals. There is another matter to report to the readers. Recently, China has stipulated that the profits of private businesses for citizens shall not exceed ten percent. If they exceed this limit, the excess profit will be at the disposal of the public. For example, many factories engaged in foreign trade earn profits that greatly exceed ten percent. All excess profits must be used to improve the treatment of workers. Therefore, the wages and benefits of Chinese workers have gradually increased recently. Mrs. Surya had said long ago that the money earned in China would remain in China. In fact, not only that, but the money she invests in Chinese businesses will also remain in China forever, for the development of China. Let's rein in our words, like a wild horse. These days, Jin Danyu is busy assisting Mrs. Surya in planning and carrying out various businesses. So, today's promise to Mr. Wu Junsu to come to Suzhou is precisely stealing leisure from a busy schedule. Jin Danyu is a cheerful person. With her in the house, it becomes much livelier. So, before she even entered the door, her laughter could be heard. Many of her sisters came out to greet her, crowding around Jin Danyu and bringing her inside. (98)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>The Central Photography Studio's First Public Performance: National Defense Drama "Battle"</h3>
<p>Written by Zhang Min, directed by Zhao Dan, starring Bai Yang and Gu Er'yi</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the unprecedented War of Resistance in Chinese history, many people in Shanghai, which had always been the center of film and drama, immediately left the city and went to the interior. During these twenty-two months, these drama workers went deep into the war zones and villages, using the bridge of drama to connect the relatively slow-moving rural areas and ordinary people with the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>I remember Jin Shan once wrote a wartime drama communication, saying that there was a local gentry who owned many guns and armed peasants, but he had not expressed his support for the War of Resistance. So, when they performed a play (a play that aroused the spirit of national salvation), they invited this gentleman to watch. After watching the play, the gentleman stood up in great emotion and firmly stated that he would do his best to fight the invaders! This small example shows how great the mission of salvation dramas is.</p>
<p>In addition to Wang Xianzai, Gong Jianong, Sun Min, Tang Jie, and Xu Xinyuan, who have returned to Shanghai, the rest, such as Lan Ping, Li Lin, and Zuo Ming, are all in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, engaged in drama work; Jin Shan and Wang Ying formed the Salvation Drama Troupe to promote abroad; Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, and Ouyang Yuqian stayed in Hong Kong to continue making films.</p>
<p>Most of the major directors in Shanghai, such as Ying Yunwei, Shi Dongshan, and Hong Shen, are in Chongqing. Many famous actors in Shanghai have joined the Central Photography Studio. This Central Photography Studio, centered on Shanghai directors and actors, has produced many anti-Japanese newsreels and films with anti-Japanese themes in one year.</p>
<p>Recently, all the members of the Central Photography Studio have prepared a large-scale public performance. The lineup of performers is rarely seen in inland performances. Moreover, most of them are familiar faces from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The play for this performance is a five-act national defense drama called "Battle." The playwright is Zhang Min, who has directed "Romeo and Juliet" and "Thunderstorm" for amateur experimental theater groups. The director is Zhao Dan, a well-known young actor from Shanghai. The "stage manager" is Gu Er'yi, who became famous in the film industry for playing the county magistrate in "Night of Joy," and Zhu Jinming, who is best at "amateur" lighting.</p>
<p>As for the actors, there are many more familiar actors, such as Bai Yang, Shi Chao, Wei Heling, Gu Er'yi, Qian Qianli, and all the actors of the Central Photography Studio. The theater for the public performance is the Cathay Grand Theatre. Although we have not seen this performance, we can imagine the enthusiasm and success of the public performance.</p>
<h3>Actors' Activities</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Feng Zihe Intends to Become a Monk: The old actor Feng Zihe likes Buddhism in his later years. He enjoys teaching his students. Recently, he wrote a martial arts play for the Golden Grand Theater, based on the story of Hu Luo'er. The entire manuscript has been completed and is planned to be rehearsed when Mao Shilai comes south. Yesterday, a reporter visited him and had a long talk. He suddenly expressed that he would go to become a monk, saying that all preparations were in place. This is an excellent opportunity and will be implemented this year. However, he will stay in Shanghai for the time being. When the situation improves, he plans to escape to Putuo Mountain.</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun Guest Stars in Cantonese Opera: Since joining the Golden Grand Theater, Zhang Eyun's reputation has been soaring, dominating Shanghai. It is heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai, contacted the theater. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association will perform a charity Cantonese opera for six days, and invited Zhang Eyun to join as a guest star.</p>
<p>Liu Hanchen is Doing Well: The martial arts veteran actor Liu Hanchen has been invited by the Tianchan Stage to come south. Since taking the stage, his performances have been sold out, breaking Huang Guiqiu's record. The plays he performs are "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin under the Moon" and "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles." His entire "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is different from others. He himself also stated that he has formed his own school. Liu has been away from Shanghai since leaving the Golden Grand Theater. He has returned to Shanghai after several years. His demeanor remains the same, and his artistry and spirit are even more abundant than before.</p>
<p>Dance World Sketches</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Whose Crime (Part 1)</h3>
<p>In recent months, many cases about dance hostesses have been seen in newspapers, the most prominent being the suicide case of He Die and a certain dance patron, and the lawsuit case of Gu Yumei and a Mr. Lei. We cannot list them all or criticize them one by one. The book says: Everything has a beginning, but few have an end. These many unfortunate events, the parties (20) cannot be careful at the beginning, and it cannot be said that this is one of the reasons. In "Dream of the Red Chamber," there are two sentences—knowing today, why bother in the first place. I think these people at the last moment, may not have this feeling</p>
<p>Once, I came out of the Paramount Ballroom and met a dance hostess apprentice, her face pale, head down, as if she had some hidden worries. I asked her if she was here for an appointment? She said, who would come to a unlucky person. I wanted to find someone to talk to, would master be willing to accompany me? So we found a cafe to sit down, she said: He Die is dead, we can never see her again, I knew she said it with feeling, so I replied to him: Chen Xiaotian is dead, you can't see him anymore either. She said: No wonder people say you are thirteen o'clock, (dance hostess slang, probably means crazy.) Clearly a good person is sitting here, how can you say he is dead? I said: This is Chen Xiaotian at this moment, what about the Chen Xiaotian you saw last time? For example, if I change my name to Tian Xiaochen today, for example, if I never see you again after the last meeting, what's the difference between that and me really dying? Besides, it seems very ordinary for you and me to sip tea and talk here tonight, but I can say that it is absolutely impossible to reproduce it in the same way in the future. She said, I may be poor, but I can still afford this cup of coffee, don't talk so difficult. I said, it's not a matter of money, if our meeting here next time, the motive is already different from this time, not to mention the adults we talked about, the things we ate, the surrounding environment and the guests, can there be one thing that is the same as this time? Lao Tzu said it well, length and shortness complement each other, high and low lean against each other, which means that all external appearances are relative rather than absolute. Zhuangzi said: Call me a cow, and I will respond as a cow, call me a horse, and I will respond as a horse, which means that everything about me changes with each person's observation. So we don't need to be too serious about everything in life. If he is taller than me, I might as well say he is a tall person, and if he is short, I will say he is a short person. If he treats me well, he always thinks I am good. I might as well admit that I am good, and I might as well admit that he is a good person. If he treats me badly, he always thinks I am bad. I might as well admit that I am bad, and I might as well admit that he is a bad person. As for the person who used to treat me well, now suddenly treats me badly, that's just that his perception of me has changed from the past to the present, why not change a little bit too. In short, Zhang San and Li Si are just pronouns. If Zhang San used to treat you well, but now suddenly treats you badly, why must you cling to the good impression of Zhang San in the past, why not treat him as Li Si? After a while, I met a student again. She said that Master is really a good person. If I hadn't heard what you said that night, I would have almost committed suicide. I said, you think I'm a good person, then I'm a good person. She said, when will you talk to me again, I feel much more cheerful in spirit now. I said, there is a couplet in the Guandi Temple, the second line is "Everything follows fate, fate has its share, nothing is asked beyond it" Whether you and I have a chance to talk again depends on your and my fate.</p>
<h3>A Who's Who of Small Theaters (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Man Fu</p>
<p>The Era Department</p>
<p>The Era Theater, the venue is larger, the seats are more comfortable, and the actors it employs are also very complete. The front desk is managed by a Mr. Shen, while the backstage is contracted by Zhang Wenjuan's father, Lian Sheng. Xi Yongyi is hired to take charge. Among the three "small theaters," the Era Theater sells the best, but unfortunately, it is not managed properly. The best seats are controlled by the tea servants. Non-acquaintances cannot get the best seats. As a result, there are often disputes in the theater, and business is gradually declining. If it can be actively reformed, it can also save the situation.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjuan is the leading male role of the Era Theater. She learned her art from two gentlemen, but what she learned was not the right path. Recently, she hired the old actor Chen Xiuhua as a teacher. A famous teacher will surely produce excellent students. Su Shaoqing also greatly appreciated her performances in "Li Ling Stele," "Black Basin," and "Pearl Curtain Village." She is only twenty-eight years old and can perform many plays. If we talk about the Kun (female) actors who play male roles in small theaters, Wenjuan should be the best, more promising than Le Di.</p>
<p>Jiang Muping is the daughter of Jiang Xintang. She can perform even more plays than Wenjuan, but unfortunately, she is broad but not precise. Her acting and expressions are not weak, and her appearance is also good. Her art is close to Ma Lianliang's style, which is not appreciated by knowledgeable people. Her plays are taught by her father. If she works hard, her future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Qiu Yunyan, a Kun actor who plays Qingyi and Huadan, is the daughter of the late famous martial arts actor Zhang Mingwu. Her appearance is similar to Jia Biyun in her prime, and her acting is also like her. Her art was personally taught by her uncle, Liu Zhenting, following the rules and completely in the old style. (Liu Zhenting was the early famous Zijin Xian of the chrysanthemum world. Most of the Kun actors in Shanghai came from his school.)</p>
<p>Su Qiu is the daughter-in-law of the late old actor Xiao Mengqi and the wife of Meng Xiaofan. From a famous family of actors, she is of course not bad. Su Qiu plays Qingyi with dignity and solemnity, and plays Huadan with elegance and unrestrainedness. Xiaofan has been dead for many years. Su Qiu is determined to remain a widow and makes a living by singing. There is no Kun actor in Shanghai who can match her. Qiu Fenglin, a Kun actor who plays male roles, is Xiao Junpei, who used to sing both male and female roles in the Youmei Class of the Xianshi Amusement Park more than ten years ago. His acting has become slippery. He is old and not valued, and now he has become a member of the troupe. However, three years ago, he sang in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area under the name of Lian Kuiliang and was very famous.</p>
<p>Zhou Xueqin, from the Women's Peking Opera Troupe, is the second-rate Dan actor of the Era Theater. Her voice is very good, but unfortunately, her appearance is not beautiful. Her father plays the qin in the Qiankun Theater of the Great World. An Shuying is a student of Zhu Dongmei's Fengyi Kun Class. Her martial arts are still impressive, but her appearance lacks heroism and her pronunciation is not good. It is a pity that she is short, which is her biggest disadvantage, but her play style is quite upright, which is rare in small theaters.</p>
<p>Shen Junqing, a male actor, plays Xiaosheng. His appearance is too vulgar, but he plays poor scholar roles such as Zhuangyuan Pu Hongxi very well.</p>
<p>Hou Jiankun, also a male actor, sings Hualian. His voice is loud and his posture is good.</p>

<h3>The Financial Xiamen Gang's Momentum Does Not Weaken; Cash Falls First and Then Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash speculation on the black market fluctuated slightly. The situation rose and fell depending on the supply and demand. Although the silver shops and money exchange businesses all absorbed purchases on behalf of the Xiamen Gang, and some local wealthy people also came to participate, the market fell due to the continuous surge of gold shops and cash shops acting as vendors and multiple accounts. It once fell to a low of 2,070 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business showed renewed buying interest, and the sellers' willingness to supply weakened. The potential immediately reacted and returned to the high price of 2,075 yuan at the close of the day. As a result, it fell by two yuan. People's hearts in all quarters were very calm. The transaction was similar to the previous day, about 720 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops fell by one yuan. There was no change in customs gold and Sino-British pure gold.</p>
<p>Speculation Only Down Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was slightly weak due to the selling interest of gold shops and cash shops. The opening price was 2,075 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than the previous closing, with the gold shop first selling 50 taels to the money exchange business. After the opening, the silver shop gang also sold 50 taels to the money exchange business at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, the cash shop sold 50 taels to the securities gang at a price of 73 yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the money exchange business at the same price. Although gold shops and others still frequently sold, a certain money exchange business suddenly took the opportunity to absorb a large amount of purchases, so the situation turned flat. The gold shop sold a total of 150 taels to a certain money exchange business at a price of 72 yuan. Later, the cash shop and the silver shop gang also sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business at the same price. After that, the buying interest of a certain money exchange business weakened, and the market situation declined slightly. The gold shop sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang at a price of 71 yuan. Before long, the money exchange business sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang at a price of 70 yuan. Later, the gold shops mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 71 yuan. Since there were only buyers and no sellers, there was no trading opening, so the closing price at noon was still 71 yuan. In the afternoon, the market rebounded due to the renewed buying interest of a certain money exchange business and the weakening of the gold shops' willingness to supply. The opening price immediately increased by four yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from the gold shop at a price of 75 yuan. Subsequently, it bought 50 taels from the same industry at a price of 74 yuan. Later, it bought 50 taels from the silver shop gang again, with the closing price at night being 1,075 yuan. As a result, it fell by two yuan compared to the previous night's closing. The difference throughout the day was five yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,080 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,070 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no trading openings.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Fell by One Yuan</p>
<p>The initial exchange of jewelry gold in silver shops was unchanged, but at 10:40, the price was immediately reduced by one yuan due to the sudden decline in speculation. There have been no changes since then. The Datong Bank changed the price to 210 yuan, the Xinhe Bank to 208 yuan, and the purchase price to 202 yuan.</p>
<p>No Change in British Pure Gold</p>
<p>London, 27th telegram. British pure gold remained stable due to the stability of the pound. The price remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. The Chinese cash purchase price of the central bank was also fixed at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price was also unchanged at 1,207 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 cents.</p>
<h3>Supply and Demand Match; Exchange Rate Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the major foreign banks and British banks (acting as agents for Japanese banks), Chinese banks, Guangdong foreign banks, and Dutch banks continued to compete fiercely, but the exchange rate remained stable due to the competition of foreign banks such as HSBC to supply, which was sufficient to match supply and demand. As a result, all were flat. The transaction was still strong. Due to the selling interest of money exchange businesses, the Hong Kong exchange rate eased slightly after foreign banks absorbed it and were willing to supply.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was one or two five longer for both near and far. The New York silver price remained stable. The London raw gold was also unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American, to Shanghai, and to French was flat. The exchange rate of American to British and to Shanghai was still flat, and it was one or two five longer to French. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 8 pence and 25 for the British exchange rate and 16 yuan and 0625 for the American liquor, both of which were unchanged compared to the previous night's closing. After the opening, although Chinese banks, foreign banks, and foreign firms scrambled to settle British gold, they were not affected because British banks, HSBC, and Mackay continued to supply steadily. Guangdong, Dutch, and foreign firms successively settled spot British cabinets of HSBC and Mackay at 8 pence and 25. The HSBC listing was not changed, and the silver balance tax was announced at 7 and a half, with a tax of 6.00%. Subsequently, the British bank, Youli, again absorbed a certain bank's spot American exchange rate of 16 yuan and 0625 on behalf of the Japanese banking sector. After that, the foreign firm also absorbed a certain bank's spot American exchange rate of 16 yuan and 0625, so the situation was stagnant. Near noon, the transaction turned clear, and the money exchange business slightly sold the Hong Kong exchange rate, selling spot Hong Kong exchange rates of 56 yuan and 55 yuan 875 to foreign banks and Dutch banks. The situation was also quite stable. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price, British and American exchange rates, was the same as the morning opening. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan and 75.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the foreign firm first came to settle HSBC's spot British exchange rate of 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, the British bank, Youli, continued to absorb Hua Bi's spot American exchange rate of 16 yuan and 0625 on behalf of Japan. The process remained stagnant. After entering, foreign banks, Dutch banks, and Hua Bi successively supplied spot Hong Kong exchange rates of 15 yuan 875 and 75 to foreign firms, with the situation slightly loosening and hardening. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price, the British exchange rate was 8 pence and 25, the American exchange rate was 16 yuan and 0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan 8125. As a result, compared to the previous night's closing, the British and American currencies were unchanged, and the Hong Kong exchange rate hardened by 0625.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Identity of Soybean Cake: A General Review of the Oil Cake Industry</h3>
<h3>Most Chinese Oil Factories Have Fallen Along With Occupied Territories</h3>
<h3>Only Two Factories Remain: Dayouyu and Dadeshin</h3>
<h3>The Soybean Oil Market Has Lost Its Center of Gravity, Only Seeing Manipulation and Control</h3>
<h3>Three Profits From One Transaction: An Unprecedentedly Huge Profit</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper published articles regarding the identity of soybean cake, we have subsequently received a statement from the Oil Cake Industry Association on behalf of Dayouyu, which has been published in the previous two days' newspapers. However, this newspaper's business news maintains a fair stance. Having heard something, and then receiving a correction, this issue should provide readers with a clearer understanding so that black and white can be distinguished and public doubts can be dispelled. Therefore, we have investigated the situation with oil factory industry and obtained the following information:</p>
<p>Before August 13th, the business of oil pressing factories in this city was quite developed. Those located in Tanzi Bay and north of Caojia Bo Bang included Changji, Lide, Shenghelong, Dachangxin, Shunyu, Hengxingtai, and Suifeng, totaling seven factories. In Pudong, there were two factories: Dadeshin (located in Yangjiadu, specializing in soybean oil pressing) and Changde. Only two factories were located in the Public Concession: Dayouyu (also pressing soybean oil, etc.) and Dadeshin (this factory specialized in cottonseed oil pressing). The main products of each factory were soybean oil, soybean cake, cottonseed oil, and cottonseed cake. A portion also pressed coconut oil, rapeseed oil, and peanut oil, etc. After the outbreak of war, the factories in Bangbei and Pudong were unable to operate, and suffered significant losses in terms of property and business. The Dadeshin and Dayouyu factories suffered less damage because they were located in the safety zone, but their business was also temporarily suspended. It was not until around April of last year that the cottonseed portion of the business resumed operations. However, due to environmental factors and inconvenient transportation, there were concerns about the supply of raw materials. Furthermore, the dumping of duty-evading soybean oil on the market at that time greatly affected cottonseed oil prices. Therefore, operations were only maintained to keep the employees working.</p>
<p>Dayouyu was the larger of the two factories. In addition to using some of its products for its own purposes, it also pressed coconut oil for Dachangxin and pressed other vegetable oils for customers. The soybean cake portion of the business could not start operations at the same time because of scarce domestic soybean raw materials and high prices due to competition from the Cantonese traders, which made it unprofitable for the factory. It is understood that this soybean cake was mostly shipped to Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places. Purchasers required that the raw materials be domestically produced. Although a large amount of duty-evading northeastern soybeans arrived at that time, and the prices were very low, the profits were substantial, it is said that the factory adhered to principles and did not purchase any. Subsequently, soybeans from Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Tongchonghai, and other places were shipped in relatively large quantities and were gradually purchased. Only from August of last year did a small part of the business resume operations, using 200 to 500 dan of soybeans per day, producing 400 to 1,000 pieces of cake. The average workload was only about one-tenth of what it was before the war. Southern China had a high demand for this domestic soybean cake, and there was often a shortage of supply. However, due to the limited availability of raw materials, work was intermittent, the output was small, and the price rose from 2.7 yuan to around 3.5 yuan. Starting this year, some merchants, because the factory's cake was insufficient to meet demand, ordered a large quantity of Dalian soybean cake from a certain merchant for sale in the occupied areas, priced at 3 yuan, which was profitable since the cake was slightly more expensive. However, due to the location, this Dalian cake could not be sold in southern China and eastern Zhejiang. Thus, some unscrupulous merchants, such as so-and-so, ordered tens of thousands of pieces of "Yuji" soybean cake, a counterfeit of Dayouyu's factory brand, from Dalian, in order to pass it off as domestic product and deceive customers. After Dayouyu factory discovered this, they published a warning in the newspaper and issued certificates of origin. Earlier this month, several thousand pieces of cake were shipped to Quanzhou on the Shanghai-bound Shenguang steamship, among which were some counterfeit cakes. Without distinguishing between genuine and fake, all were detained by the local authorities. Later, the municipal chamber of commerce sent a telegram to verify each one, and they were released. To this day, the official domestic soybean cake is inevitably affected by the counterfeit cake, and transactions are unusually slow. The sales in the occupied areas have been encroached upon by Dalian cake, because the cost of the factory's cake cannot be devalued to compete with it due to cost considerations, so legitimate merchants are greatly harmed.</p>
<p>The Changde oil factory in Pudong was originally operated by Chen Ziyi, a major grain merchant. After the Chinese army retreated westward, it was taken over by the Japanese Yoshida Trading Company. The factory was reopened by the company itself in the autumn of last year to specialize in pressing cottonseed oil. Starting this spring, the Tongsheng oil factory, which had been closed before the war, also used the factory to press soybean oil and soybean cake, with "Shengji" as the trademark for the cake. This soybean cake, also due to the raw material situation, can only be sold in the occupied areas. According to the market, Dalian cake with "Yuanji" and "Yuanji" brands are the most well-known, and there are also many miscellaneous cakes. Recently, it was heard that someone was shipping "Yuanji" cake to Xinghua, Fujian, in alarming quantities, and it is regrettable that the local area does not understand the source of the cake and is thus deceived.</p>
<p>Currently, the so-called soybean oil and soybean cake transactions on the market are all Dalian goods, so the factory's oil cake has no foothold. As for the Shunyu and Hengxingtai factories in Bangbei, there were rumors this spring that a certain merchant was seeking to cooperate in operating the cottonseed portion of the business, and had contacted the factories several times, but no agreement was reached. Later, the merchant planned to proceed alone, sending people to repair machinery and collect cottonseed. However, due to the small output of raw materials this spring and incomplete machinery, it has not yet started operations. The remaining factories, such as Suifeng, Changji, Shenghelong, Dachangxin, and Lide, are all in the war zone and cannot resume operations. Some, like Changji, have already been dissolved in effect. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the state of industry in this city is lamentable.</p>
<p>Since most of the Chinese oil factories cannot operate, and the small oil factories in the interior have no goods to ship, the sales in Shanghai completely rely on Dalian oil. Before the Chinese army retreated westward, Dalian oil could not be openly sold on the market, and was sold in a secretive manner. Since last year, Dalian oil has been sold openly and without restraint, and its momentum has become increasingly arrogant and unparalleled. Furthermore, the rise in oil prices has also been caused by the futures contracts thrown out by foreign firms, who then regretted their agreements when the contracts expired. Originally, they were supposed to deliver the full amount of goods upon expiration, but they only allowed for the delivery of 25%. Later, it was reduced to 20%, and most only delivered 18%. Since futures were not settled, the market became firm and expensive, and there was also manipulation from within. Since futures trading was not sustainable, it had to focus on spot trading. In reality, this spot was originally supposed to be the spot for settling futures. The spot price was higher than the futures price, and now selling spot again meant an additional profit. As a result, there were three profits from one transaction, and the profits were unprecedentedly generous. When ordering, oil, cake, and beans had to be ordered together, and none could be missing. When delivering, the sluggish soybean cake was still delivered according to the contract, so the price of the cake was lower, while the price of oil and beans was firm, because some were settled and some were not.</p>
<h3>Fire Machine Cotton: Selling Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Trading Halted</h3>
<p>The cotton business remains as depressed as ever. However, the industry is pushing 1,500 bales of fire machine cotton. Selling prices continue to decline. Among them, one batch was priced at only 65.5 yuan, a body ratio compared to foreign cotton is inferior.</p>
<p>As for foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market initially fell due to the settlement of May deliveries and foreign purchases. There were still some new transactions in the middle, so it did rebound once. As a result, the closing price was down 7 to 9 "bangxi" compared to the previous day. There will be many difficulties with the issue of U.S. cotton subsidies in the future. However, many parties are fearful of this plan, and all industries are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for Hitler's speech today. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell slightly, including forecasts, by 25 "luobi," Egyptian cotton rose 6 "bangyin," and Liverpool rose sharply by 10 "bangxi." Converted to legal tender, U.S. cotton fell by 4 "jiao" per dan, Indian cotton fell by 1 "jiao," and Egyptian cotton rose by 3 "jiao."</p>
<p>Although yarn prices have risen sharply in the Shanghai foreign cotton market, factories are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude in purchasing raw cotton, listening to Hitler's speech and waiting for a resolution to the U.S. cotton subsidy issue before determining their cotton purchasing strategy. Here are the translated factory prices for overseas cotton markets:</p>
<p>It is also inferior. However, the factories have completely stopped, and not a single bale has been purchased. The situation in the cotton market is inversely proportional to that in the yarn market. Not only can cotton prices not advance, but they have retreated. In fact, cotton of inferior quality, close to the plum rain season, is difficult to store for long, so it must be sold off at a low price. However, goods of this kind are still not willing to make much concessions on the selling price. 519 bales of cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived at Xiasa. Here are the current cotton conditions:</p>
<h3>"Counterfeit Currency" Plummets Frequently</h3>
<h3>Worth Only 7.5 Jiao Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 28th—The black market price of counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" opened this morning down 1.5 yuan compared to the opening price on the morning of the 27th. 100 yuan in legal tender can buy 132 yuan in "Joint Reserve Bank Notes," meaning that 1 yuan in "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" is worth only 7.5757575 yuan in legal tender, an unprecedentedly low price. Checking yesterday's (28th) market price, it is down a huge 14 yuan and 7.5 "jiao" per 100 yuan compared to the Saturday (22nd) less than a week ago, meaning that the "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" have fallen from 80% to 70%, a drop of 1 "jiao" per yuan.</p>
<p>Most Foreign Currencies Firm and Expensive</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds had abundant supply. Demand for British and American gold notes was still strong, and the supply of U.S. gold notes was not smooth, so prices continued to be firm and expensive. Demand for Hong Kong notes was very strong. Overseas Chinese and Belgian currencies were supplied by Qiantai, and the transaction volume was very large, so prices rose again. Demand for Singapore and Annam notes was also strong, and prices rose significantly. There was a supply of Italian notes, and the price fell slightly. Guild transactions were very rare. Hongchang sold 1,000 Italian notes from Zhenxingjin. Yesterday's market prices: U.S. gold notes rose by 2 "li," Hong Kong notes rose by 4 "li," Singapore notes rose by 1.8 "fen," Annam notes rose by 4 "fen," and Italian notes fell by 2 "li."</p>
<h3>Securities:</h3>
<h3>Rally on Recapture of Nanchang.</h3>
<h3>Domestic Bonds Show Excitement</h3>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Await Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>The securities black market has gradually become firmer. Initially, the recapture of Nanchang boosted morale. Then, rumors that Hitler's declaration would not lead to war caused short sellers to panic. Cautious players covered their positions. In the afternoon, gold and cloth trading houses and financial institutions bought. The sluggish mood of the past few days was swept away. The market had a mostly excited tone. The actual effects of these expectations remain to be confirmed. Morning opened with Defu, Tongrun, Maoyongfeng and other brokerages buying. The market rotated, trending firmer. Qiafeng, Tiansheng, Zhenkang and #38 sold. Bids outnumbered asks. Midday was slightly better by one "jiao." After the midday rumors, buy orders surged. Defu continued to add to its position. Yongkang, Tongyu, Shuntai and #20 had demand. There were few sellers. Tongkang, Lianhe and Datong slightly shed positions. Buying dominated. Type C stocks hit three yuan. Further improvement expected. Market closed higher, between 3.5 and 5.5 jiao. Turnover approximately one million yuan. A summary follows:</p>
<p>Stock trades: Fifty shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange traded at 39.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The Tianjin dispatch in yesterday's paper incorrectly identified the Haihe Bonds as issued in 1914. They were issued in April 1918. Apologies.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that markets are paying close attention to international affairs and Hitler's speech. This is holding back trade and preventing market progress. Participants are directionless until the German leader speaks. Jardine shares were stable, trading ex-dividend at 17.7 yuan (adding back the 2.575 dividend equals 20.045 yuan). Land and Exploration fell to 7.5 yuan due to the impact of depreciating North China puppet currency on company profits. Ruirong shares were active around 6.9 yuan. Insurance shares remain thin and ignored.</p>
<p>London Far East Company's stock prices for 27 April (Thursday) showed no movement in either direction.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt prices for 27 April (Thursday) were mixed. Crisp Loan rose 15 shillings to 36 pounds, 5 shillings. Reorganization Loan rose five shillings to 51 pounds. British-German loan fell one pound to 64 pounds. Vickers Aircraft Loan fell one-half pound to 16.5 pounds. All others unchanged.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Engineering (English branch) Ltd. will hold its 29th general meeting on 16 May. The board also decided to pay a dividend of one jiao per share for 1938.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Market Is Preparing</h3>
<h3>Weak Exports Of 40,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Yesterday's flour market saw both domestic and foreign flour trending flat. Demand from outside merchants has gradually waned. Northern merchants were hesitant to buy because the value of Tianjin money has fallen sharply. Spot transactions also weakened. Southern merchants are still active. They demand lower prices. However, factory prices are still high due to elevated raw material costs since flour prices fell. Factories are unwilling to lower prices easily. Factory prices were still 4.445 yuan. #3 and #4 flours saw little change. Total volume traded was approximately 40,000 bags. The market is brewing. On the 29th, 1,000 bags were exported to Yantai, 26,100 bags to Tianjin, and 11,500 bags to Shantou.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Trending in line with domestic. Quotes for outside traders were still at US$2.60. New quotes were scarce and new deliveries delayed. Current foreign flour sales were still strong. Medium-quality brands were still around 4.445 yuan. The only activity was light retail on main street. Merchant demand nearly stopped. Buyers and sellers were equally reluctant to move. No major changes were expected in the short term.</p>
<h3>Already Controlling Oil and Beans</h3>
<h3>Now Obstructing Rice and Grain</h3>
<p>Shanghai Residents' Lives Are Getting Harder</p>
<p>Domestic Rice: Has not arrived in a while due to the closing of Changshu and Wuxi districts. Now we hear that someone is blocking Southern Merchants again, preventing all rice from flowing in. 2,000+ bags of Suzhou-Tong Merchants wrapped rice came by cart, but Suzhou is also considering banning shipments. Rice prices are soaring in Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Common rice wants 12 yuan per delivery. As a result, interior transporters from Ruofeng and Nan'gang have been transporting rice from Zhejing Province. Under these conditions, Shanghai's supplies are dwindling. The market and merchants are insightful, but the warm weather causes rice quality to decline. Most are unwilling to buy. As a result, medium and fine rice ticked up slightly. Du Yang and others rice was tight. All other rice was flat.</p>
<p>Customer Scented Rice: After several days of purchases by the Ningbo merchants, the market rose. Main street store owners were reluctant and watched from the sidelines. Yesterday, Ningbo demand weakened. The market briefly flattened. However, main street stores used the opportunity to buy. In total, between 3,000 and 4,000 bags traded. Medium rice grew popular. High-gloss and low-quality rice were unaffected. Cart shipments were rare, but river shipments totaled between 4,000 and 5,000 bags as Shanghai reported price rises, and merchants moved to capture the gains.</p>
<h3>Yarn</h3>

<h3>Cash Yarn Is Marching Forward</h3>
<h3>Double Horse Peaks At 424 Yuan</h3>
<h3>Up Over 60 Yuan Since Last Month's Low</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the rally looks set to accelerate. The market is lively. According to public opinion, recent battlefield victories, including the recapture of Bochang, and the fall of the Japanese puppet currency have drawn speculators into the market. As a result, the market is growing and buying. Sellers are reluctant to sell. The market temporarily lacks shares. The rally is in full swing. A portion of the market surveyed said that the bulk of buyers were stockpiling and re-warehousing. Few were shipping for export. There is a shortage of space on transports, and sales channels are narrow. As a result, most trades involve buying and selling. The afternoon rally was fierce. 20-count Double Horse Yarn continued to advance. Prices peaked at 424 yuan, up 9.5 yuan from the previous day. Prices were as low as 363.5 yuan on 25 March.

As a result, the market was battered again. 100 barrels of Dalian crude oil traded at prices ranging from 45.85 yuan to 45.5 yuan. 400+ barrels of seven-day delivery traded at 44 yuan to 43.5 yuan. 50 pieces of small basket Dalian oil were 44 yuan. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were 32.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Imports on 28 April totaled 1,240 items from Tianjin, and 85 items from Yantai.</p>
<p>The soybean cake market continues to see trade of Large Bean Cake, but Swedish Cake sales were slow, and this is impacting morale. Futures fell. There was volatility. Prices ranged 9 jiao. The highest price was significantly higher than the previous day. For May delivery, 1,000 pieces of Yuan Ji Cake traded at 2.91 yuan. 7,000 pieces of mixed cake traded at prices ranging from 2.97 to 2.88 yuan. For June delivery, 8,000 pieces of Yuan Ji Cake fell from 3.11 to 3.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longan and Flowers Are Scarce</h3>
<p>Longan trades have not been smooth in recent times, and trading houses have not engaged in transactions for a long time. According to production prices, such as those from Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, the reported prices are all inverted. As a result, trading houses are unable to open for business, and there is no intention to buy more goods. The position of each trading house is narrow, and none dare to buy much. However, according to recent correspondence, the new flowers are uniformly bad. Zhangzhou is at 20-30%. Quanzhou is at 20%. Xinghua is at 30%. There is still a long way to go before harvest. If weather damages the harvest, the production total could decrease further. There remains room for change.</p>

<p>Traffic and Transportation Weekly</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Rangoon</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Burma Road, through diligent preparations by the authorities, it will soon be officially open to traffic, connecting with the Burmese railway to form a major international transportation line for our country. Consequently, Rangoon in British Burma and Haiphong in French Annam share equal importance. Currently, major Chinese banks, trading firms, and transportation agencies have already established offices there. It is anticipated that the city will experience even greater development in the near future. As Rangoon serves as a key hub for our country's foreign trade, it is essential to document all aspects of the city.</p>
<p>Rangoon is situated on the delta of the Irrawaddy River, twenty-four miles from the river mouth. The port is 2,400 yards wide and four and a half miles long, allowing ships to enter and exit freely. The wharf is 3,332 feet long, and the floating bridge wharf is over 600 feet long. All imported goods are unloaded at the wharf and then transported inland via railway or the Irrawaddy River. Exported goods are transported by barge to large ships moored in the harbor, which then carry them to commercial ports in various countries. Rangoon's main imports include machinery, silk, chemicals, sugar, salt, linen, and fish. The primary exports are rice, tea, timber, cotton, lead, silver, zinc, copper, rubber, and gravel.</p>
<p>The city of Rangoon features a European style, with wide roads, American-style buildings, grand bank and commercial buildings, European-style hotels, and numerous famous temples and pagodas. The climate is tropical, with an average annual temperature of around 85 degrees Celsius. November to March is the coolest period, with temperatures rising sharply at the end of March and beginning of April, making April the hottest month. May to October is the rainy season, characterized by a very humid and sultry climate. As you approach Rangoon harbor by ship, the initial view of a flat, muddy landscape may disappoint you, but the scenery within Rangoon is truly beautiful. The most famous landmark is the Shwe Dagon Pagoda, which stands 368 feet tall and gleams with gold. It is visible from dozens of miles away, especially when viewed amidst the surrounding lush greenery, creating a truly captivating sight. Visitors constantly flock to the pagoda to pay their respects. Other notable attractions include Dalhousie Park, Royal Lakes (seven miles from the city), the large prison, the Oriental Market, and the government lumberyard where elephants are used for transportation, all of which are worth visiting.</p>
<p>According to the 1933 statistics, Rangoon has a population of 400,415 people. Over 50,000 Chinese nationals reside in the city, primarily from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, who mainly operate in the rice and timber industries. Besides the Fujianese and Cantonese, there are also many Yunnanese who are mostly engaged in the gemstone trade. There are several Chinese primary and secondary schools, as well as several Chinese newspapers. The Chinese Consulate General and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce are also located here, wielding considerable influence. Furthermore, the Burmese government does not impose any particularly harsh regulations on overseas Chinese in Burma, which is much better than many other Southeast Asian ports.</p>
<p>There are three land routes from Rangoon to Yunnan Province in China. The main route involves taking the North Burma Railway train from Rangoon to Katha, then to Bhamo, and then taking a car to the Chinese-Burmese border town of Wanting (just 170 kilometers from Bhamo). From there, one follows the Burma Road through Longling, Baoshan, Yongping, Xiaguan, and Chuxiong to reach Kunming. The other two routes are: one, taking a train from Rangoon via Mandalay to Lashio, then by car through Namhkam into southern Yunnan Province; and two, taking a train from Rangoon to Myitkyina to Pianma in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Regarding the shipping routes from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Rangoon, there are no direct routes from Shanghai. One can first take a ship on any route to Hong Kong or Singapore and then transfer to Rangoon. The British India Steam Navigation Company (B.I.S.N. Co., Ltd.—Apcarline) has ships departing from Hong Kong to Rangoon every two weeks, stopping at Singapore, Penang, and other ports, taking fourteen days. From Singapore to Rangoon, it only takes seven days. The fare from Hong Kong to Rangoon is £24 for first class and £16 for second class. The procedures for traveling to Rangoon require first obtaining a passport from the issuing authority of the Chinese government, which must then be approved by the British Consulate before departure.</p>
<h3>Points to Note for Goods Shipped to Haiphong</h3>
<p>— Baotai</p>
<p>In the past, Haiphong was not a major trading port, and the volume of imports and exports was far less than it is now. Warehouse facilities were inadequate, and management was less than satisfactory. Now that it has suddenly become an important international transportation hub, not only is warehouse space insufficient, leading to congestion, but the lack of improved management practices has resulted in significant problems with inventory disorder. Additionally, Haiphong's customs clearance procedures are exceptionally complicated. Many shipments from various locations have been delayed or suffered accidental losses because merchants are unfamiliar with the actual conditions in Haiphong, or because of incomplete documentation, or unclear declarations. Based on my observations, I will briefly describe the points to note below:</p>
<p>Packing List: The more detailed, the better. Haiphong's customs tariffs are exceptionally strict and detailed. Even a slight error in application or omission in listing can lead to violations of regulations. Whether goods shipped to Haiphong are listed in Chinese or English, they must be translated into French. The most inconvenient situation arises when a package contains items of different categories (such as hardware, daily necessities, and other miscellaneous items). If a packing list is not attached, or if it is incomplete, the package must be opened, and the goods must be carefully categorized and a list must be prepared. If there are special items whose names cannot be determined, they must be researched repeatedly. This process is very time-consuming, often causing delays of several days. Therefore, it is best to ship one type of item per package. If it is not practically possible to do so, and a package contains several types of items, the sender must prepare a packing list with as much detail as possible. The packing list should include: (1) marks and package numbers, (2) the correct name of the goods, (3) weight and volume (in metric units per item), and (4) type of packaging. If these four items are provided, there should be no problems with customs clearance in Haiphong. Furthermore, when shipping goods to Haiphong in batches, it is often necessary to ship them in separate shipments due to vehicle constraints. Therefore, a packing list must be prepared for each package, with three copies per list. One copy should be kept in Shanghai, and the remaining copies should be sent to Haiphong for use.</p>
<p>Solid Packaging: Theft in Haiphong has become an open secret. If packages are sturdy, losses can be minimized. The most suitable size for ordinary packages is a volume of 20 cubic feet and a weight of 200 kilograms. Packages exceeding these dimensions are inconvenient to stack and are easily damaged. It is rumored that Haiphong workers, accustomed to handling Yunnan tin ingots, treat all goods as if they were as hard as tin ingots, often dropping them from high places. It is rare for such packages to remain unbroken. Therefore, in addition to making wooden boxes from high-quality wood, two iron straps should be added after customs clearance in Shanghai for protection (ordinary iron straps are usually arranged in a cross shape; parallel straps provide even greater protection). For valuable goods, a lead-lined box should be made inside the wooden box and sealed with solder for added security. For soft packages such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth, attention should be paid to whether the outer packaging is damaged during loading. If damaged, it should be repaired immediately. In short, the better the packaging, the fewer the losses.</p>
<p>The two points mentioned above are common sense, but because they are common sense, they are easily overlooked. The delays in shipping dates and losses due to theft are incalculable. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare in advance before shipment. Fortunately, these measures are easy to implement; they only require a little preparation before shipment. Currently, Haiphong warehouses are frequently reported to be full. Several new warehouses are under construction, but it will take some time for them to be completed. Therefore, Taikoo and Jardine still have strict restrictions on goods shipped to Haiphong. When ships arrive in Haiphong, the cargo often needs to be unloaded onto barges due to warehouse congestion, and then gradually moved into the warehouse. This process can take several days or even a month. It is said that Taikoo and Jardine have temporarily suspended accepting goods for transshipment to Haiphong for this reason. Some merchants, aware of the difficulties in shipping, often carry goods in their luggage when traveling to Haiphong themselves. However, Haiphong customs regulations strictly prohibit new goods in personal luggage. If discovered, they will be confiscated, and fines may even be imposed. This is something that must be paid attention to.</p>
<h3>Hotel Perspectives</h3>
<p>— Ye Wujie</p>
<p>1.  Saving on repair costs shortens the lifespan of hotel buildings.</p>
<p>2.  Fawning and flattering service does not make guests comfortable.</p>
<p>3.  Guests talking and laughing loudly, disturbing the peace of other guests, is not a right to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>4.  A rural hotel built next to a highway, disturbed by daily traffic noise, will inevitably decline in business.</p>
<p>5.  The American travel and hotel industry is expected to develop even further in 1939 due to the expositions in New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>6.  To promote the development of hotel business, one should maintain the cleanliness of the premises, strictly maintain order, provide cheerful service, and offer reasonable room rates.</p>
<p>7.  Guests who wish to enjoy the right to quiet can hang a "Do not disturb" sign on their door. Even if there is a telephone, the attendant will not inform them of calls. This is a modern hotel service.</p>
<p>8.  Hotel staff should strive for the improvement of the hotel, not just personal gain.</p>
<p>9.  Gentle and courteous service can earn twice the goodwill from guests. Hotel employees should deeply consider this.</p>
<p>10. The origin of tips comes from the coffee shops of the past. A wooden box was hung on the wall with the words "To Insure Promptness" written on it. If guests were satisfied, they could voluntarily toss a reward into the box. The first letter of each word forms the currently popular acronym TIP. (Translated from The Hotel Monthly)</p>
<h3>Notes on Inland Highways (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jing Xun</p>
<p>The entire route from Guiyang to Changsha is 1,009 kilometers long. The highway journey takes four days by car. Since the section from Yuanling to Changsha began using diesel-powered vehicles, the journey has become slower, adding one day to the overall travel time. I will now describe the lodging and dining situation along the way:</p>
<p>Day 1: Depart from Guiyang to Huangping, a distance of 190 kilometers. Purchasing tickets from Guiyang to Changsha is not as crowded as the northern and western routes. Registering the day before is enough to secure a seat. After departing, lunch is taken at Machangping. Arriving at Huangping around 4:00 PM, the city sits high on a mountain and is very basic, lacking any large shops or restaurants. The China Travel Service operates a special guesthouse, the Xinghua Hotel, which charges 60 cents for one night and two meals. There are also ten renovated berths available for 70 cents each. Day 2: From Huangping to Huang County, a distance of 200 kilometers, the journey takes eight and a half hours. Lunch is taken in Zhenyuan. After passing Zhenyuan, the route goes through Xiangzi Ridge and Panshan, where the road winds precariously through the mountains. Arriving in Huang County, one can stay at the special guesthouse, the Southwest Hotel, with room rates ranging from 60 cents to 1.60 yuan. The Huang County market is entirely on Zhongshan Street, with foreign goods stores and the vegetable market located there. The street is relatively clean. Day 3: From Huang County to Yuanling, a distance of 238 kilometers, the journey takes eight hours. Lunch is taken in Huaihua. After the car crosses the Chenxi ferry, it takes two or three hours to reach Yuanling. Yuanling, also known as Chenzhou, has a good market with stone-paved streets. The special guesthouse, the Zhuyuan Hotel, is very clean, with prices ranging from 60 cents to 1.40 yuan. Day 4: From Yuanling to Changde, lunch is taken in Guanzhuang. The route passes through Qingshan Gang, with a treacherous road and steep cliffs. The journey is very dangerous. Arriving in Changde, one can stay at the Min'an Hotel next to the bus station, which charges only 60 cents for one night and two meals. Changde is not a large city, and commerce is not thriving, with the market concentrated along Zhongshan Road. Day 5: From Changde to Changsha, lunch is taken in Yiyang, and one can arrive in Changsha in the afternoon. It is understood that this section of the highway is currently closed to traffic, so the eastern section of the Southwest Highway only goes as far as Changde. The fare from Guiyang to Changsha is 44.40 yuan, and to Changde, it is 36.30 yuan. Luggage under 20 kilograms is free, and each additional 5 kilograms costs 3.027 yuan. (The itinerary from Changde to Guiyang is the reverse.)</p>
<h3>Travel Inquiries</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Saiqiu asked about transportation conditions from Shanghai to Kelantan:</p>
<p>(Answer) To get to Kelantan, first take a ship to Singapore. The second-class fare on Italian ships is usually £14 in British currency, and the economy second-class is £10. The second-class fare on French ships is £15, and third class is £9. The journey takes seven or nine days. After arriving in Singapore, you can take a train to Kelantan. The second-class fare is 14.11 Straits dollars, and the third-class fare is 9.39 Straits dollars. If you do not take the train, you can take the Straits Steamship Company ship, which departs every Saturday and takes five days. The fare is 45 Straits dollars.</p>
<p>Messrs. Chen Li, Hu Xin, Li Haoran, Yang Zhengbo, and Wang Jian asked about the routes from Shanghai to Xi'an and Lanzhou:</p>
<p>(Answer) To go to Shaanxi and Gansu, under the current circumstances, you can only take the route through Vietnam, then through Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu to reach Xi'an. After arriving in Xi'an, take the Xilan Highway to Lanzhou. The total travel cost from Shanghai to Xi'an is 226.75 Chinese yuan (excluding first-class ship cabins and third-class train accommodations). The cost from Xi'an to Lanzhou is 26.25 yuan. The total travel time is 25 days (longer if waiting for transportation is required).</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Jizhong asked about the situation in Yan'an and Xunyi:</p>
<p>(Answer) After arriving in Xi'an, you can take the Xilan Highway to Bin County, which is 148 kilometers away. The fare is 6.7 yuan. There is no highway between Bin County and Xunyi. Fortunately, the distance is only a few dozen kilometers, so you can walk or use other means of transportation. There is no formal transportation service from Xi'an to Yan'an, so travelers usually walk together.</p>
<p>Ms. Shi Fujin asked about the conditions of fourth-class trains on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway:</p>
<p>(Answer) From Haiphong to Kunming, the fourth-class fare is 10.684 Vietnamese piasters per person, equivalent to 18.1 Chinese yuan. You must take care of your own luggage. When overweight luggage is marked, it costs over 16 Vietnamese piasters per 100 kilograms.</p>
<p>Messrs. Hu Guifen, Luo Hanlin, Zhang Yanfu, Yan Ying, Yu Yizhen, Ge Jianpei, Shi Yiling, Lin Hansui, Wei Shaopu, Lin Zilun, Ou Zhe, Chen Duanlu, Gu Da, Tie Qi, Wu Jiaxun, Wu Liangqing, Hua, etc. asked about the routes from Shanghai to Hunan and Guangxi, and to Yunnan and Chongqing:</p>
<p>(Answer) Since the ports of Zhenhai and Wenzhou have been closed, it is impossible to take the route through the ports of eastern Zhejiang. Aside from this, many are taking the route through Fuzhou, Shantou, or Guangzhou to reach the interior in order to avoid using passports and save travel expenses. However, according to investigations, the highways within Fujian Province are passable, but those outside Fujian Province have been closed to traffic. The highways near Shantou have also been interrupted. The highway from Guangzhou Bay to Yulin has also been cut off. Considering all of the above routes, although one can risk traveling them, it is ultimately not as convenient as taking the route through Vietnam. For information about this route and detailed information, please refer to the third issue of this publication. Regarding Mr. Gu's inquiry about reaching Jianshi in Hubei, you can reach it after arriving in Chongqing, and ... to Qianjiang ....</p>
<h3>Rangoon Entry Procedures</h3>
<p>— Junxin</p>
<p>Regarding the entry procedures for Chinese nationals into Rangoon, the capital of British Burma, I will describe what I have recently learned, as follows: Checking the procedures for overseas Chinese entering Rangoon are still relatively convenient. Whether it is a first-time arrival or a return trip, and regardless of whether they are in first class or lower class, all those entering Rangoon must carry a passport from the Chinese government, and after it is inspected by the Rangoon Port Police Department without any errors, they can disembark. If the passport they carry has not been certified by the British Consul stationed in various places or by the Singapore Passport Bureau, they may be refused to disembark and asked to return on the original ship. According to what I have heard, overseas Chinese often make mistakes due to unclear procedures. The major reasons for these errors are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Assuming that they can enter as long as they have a passport issued by the Chinese government, they often fail to have it certified by the British Consul or the Singapore Passport Bureau.</p>
<p>(2) Even if they have been certified, they often do not pay attention to the validity period and are refused entry because the validity period has already expired.</p>
<p>(3) Sometimes, when exporting from China or Singapore, the validity period is already close to expiring, and they do not know to apply for additional certification, causing it to become invalid when they arrive in Rangoon.</p>
<p>(4) When overseas Chinese from Burma return to China or other British or Dutch territories and then return to Burma, they often mistakenly believe that their passport is valid for both outbound and return trips, and they do not ask the British Consul or relevant government to certify it. They are only turned back when they arrive in Rangoon.</p>
<p>In summary, anyone going to Rangoon must obtain a Chinese passport and pay close attention to certification by the British Consul or other relevant authorities. Extra attention should be paid to the validity period to avoid being rejected at the last minute.</p>
