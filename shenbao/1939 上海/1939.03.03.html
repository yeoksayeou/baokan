<h3>英遠東政策無變更　不承認武力造成局面　與各關係國保持密切聯絡　對華援助無時不在考慮中　斯特拉波奇歷數日軍罪惡</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日上議院開會時、議員斯特拉波奇勳爵發演說痛詆日本在對華戰事中恣睢之行爲、其措詞之激烈、實爲上下兩院討論日本在華作戰事時所罕聞、斯氏演說中有言日、（一）戰爭現正以極度之殘暴與獸行之手段通行之、（二）「滿洲國」日當局現正故意以鴉片與其他毒品毒害華人、（三）日軍到處對中國大學與研究學問之所、作有系統之破壊、（四）日軍佔據區內已發生腐敗無慶恥之政權、而恣意胡行、無惡不爲、（五）日軍以飛機攻擊漁船、已犯最可恨之罪惡、斯氏又切言華軍今日所從事之戰鬥、不啻爲大不列顚之戰鬥、斯氏發此演說之主旨、蓋欲請政府供給關於中國戰事之情報、斯氏並特別注意華南之事變、其演說中曾作下列之問話、（一）政府現取何種步驟、保衛英國貿易之權益、（二）關於日軍侵入海南島之情勢若何、（三）政府其曾與其他有關係之列强、進行終止戰事之任何共同政策、</p>
<p>斯氏之演說、謂今之提出此問題、毫非志在仇對英政府、外次樸萊茅斯動爵去年十二月六日在上院答覆關於中國問題的辯論之演說、實爲對此與英國在華利益至有關係之問題表示堅决態度、而出人意料且受衆歡迎者其言含有一種明白的警吿使彼日人知吾人之忍耐非無窮盡者、然厥後中國仍發生至重要之事變數起、如海南島之突遭侵入、如自廣州陷落後、香港一大部分實際已被封鎖、如日當局向上海公共租界當局作種種威脅之類是也、所幸日本今日已變更其態度、乃有所謂南京政府者、竟用離奇之語調反對公共租界之英法人民、殊堪令人憤慨也、</p>
<p>斯氏直言日軍之侵入海南島、專爲挑釁性質、就與中國中央政府作戰而論、佔據該島、並無軍事目的、越南法當局在日本要求後、已阻止軍火、甚至紅十字會用品運往中國、日本乃允承認海南島爲法國利益範圍之一部分、而不予以攻擊、藉爲報答、今日法人可見日人所報答者爲何矣、即此一端、可見所謂「綏靖」政策、就日本而論、實無益可言也、</p>
<p>斯氏决述及緬甸與中國西南部間之新汽車公路、謂此爲日本軍閥所能了解之唯一語言、如彼等放大眼光縱觀大局、則可知華人今日之作戰、實爲吾人作戰也、假令日軍在兩年前能於九十日內擊破華軍之抵抗力、則試問將需幾久、即可直接戚脅香港、决乃及於馬來、再决乃及於荷屬東印度乎、假令日本已降服華人、叉假令吾人爲默洲之若干糾紛所牽　、其有人敢謂太平洋中英國之利益、將安然而不爲人所染指乎」、斯氏切言今日對華之戰事、非舊式征服之戰爭、今正以極度之殘暴與獸行之手段進行之、「滿洲國之日當局現正故意以鴉片與其他毒品陷溺華人、任何處之中國大學與研究學問之所、皆受有系統之破壞、日軍佔據區內巳產生腐敗無廉恥之政權、恣意胡行無惡不爲、歐美之商業、悉遭排斥、外交部對於所發生之慘烈暴行、已有所知矣、當南京被佔時、日本當局仟令士兵從事在暴、雖英美之代表亦遭侮辱、渠對德國之政權嘗屢作抨擊、但在此際、南京國社黨官員之行爲、其堅决至可欽仰、彼等嘗援助難民逃避、免受彼野蠻與顯亡紀律之日兵之屠殺與汚辱、</p>
<p>斯氏繼乃痛詆日軍攻擊無助之漁船、謂海中素有安息相共之，風漁船中人悉屬中國水手、確爲甚優良之民族、平時在海中遇有尋常禍事、輒加援手、彼等挾妻孥與俱、乃日軍竟以飛機下擊若輩、此實爲至堪痛恨之行爲、今欲覓相稱之言詞、加以譴責、實不可得、渠信政府已向日政府提出抗議、渠非詆責政府對於此種慘劇、視若罔覩也、</p>
<p>斯氏於是復述及南京德國社黨之官員、謂渠曾獲有消息、德商對於中國所遭遇之一切、其驚惶與不安、實與英商相同、取援助與安慰態度以對付日當局者、即德國官員也、故今有絕大之機會、可使德政府表示其忠貞與人道及期望和平之志願、其方法爲與吾人及其他有關係之列强聯合在外交上或經濟上施用壓力、以遏止日軍閥在華所作此種企圖、張伯倫之進行綏靖政策也、巳使德國獲有巨益、德國如倘願稍作報酬者、則在中國有一機會，該處德國利益實與吾人相同也、希特勒近曾宣布德國必須以物品輸出、吾則將淪於滅亡、中國有廣大之市塲、如日本政策在中國實行吿成、則德人將無任何機會可得矣、經兩年之猛鬭後、衆皆知日本爲一在經濟上易受擊破之國家、日本在此時受經濟壓力、則允易被破也、</p>
<p>在華吾人之友、及中華民族之同胞、彼中有數百萬人居於吾人東方屬地、而爲良民、今皆不解吾人何以不更積極從事設法終止此慘烈戰事、在此决軍事企圖實行以前、日商在華、可作長足之進步、乃日本軍閥不欲見和平有力統一的中國、軍閥中少壯派似能控制日政府之政策者、並不隱諱其目的、如彼等一旦成功、則無疑的必威脅澳大利亞、各政黨之議員對此問題、並無幻覺、正理禮義公道之應實行也、今正爲其時矣、此種基督敎與人道主義、已往六個月中巳在歐洲與小亞細亞大受摧殘、惡道大昌、而人類之文明的道德、則已被逐、吾人其不能開始在亞洲主張此種偉大主義、以爲刦餘之補救乎、吾人能依賴印度澳洲紐絲綸誠摯之援助、余信蘇聯法蘭西荷蘭亦將起而響應、余所主張之政策、乃和平的政策、可以不發一彈而吿成者、余以爲此種工作、國聯在兩年餘以前早應爲之，惟無論如何、英政府苟設法先在外交上作集體的壓力、如有必要、决及於經濟、再决及於金融、則吾人相信其力已足矣、其所需之敎誨、爲殘酷之武力、恐怖之行爲、與獸性之兇虐、胥無所獲、徒召不可免之懲罰而巳云、」</p>
<p>樸萊芽斯動爵代表政府置答謂、處置此問題之困難、在使吾人的容有之任何願望或情感、發生實際上之效力、斯特拉波奇動爵頃所言者、渠固大多同情、惟渠所疑者、斯氏亦曾對於其所發若干建議之實施能性、加以愼重之思慮否云、</p>
<p>樸氏於報吿中國最近事件後、述及英政府保護在華英人利益尤其是香港方面、而採取之行動、謂珠江之於香港貿易、極有重要關係、一八四二年中英條的、規定開放珠江、供英人貿易、去年十月十三日中國當局第一决封鎖該江時、廣州英總領事曾向華方提出抗議、日軍自佔據廣州後、依然封鎖珠江、英政府乃積極從事、力謀其重行開放、惟此項努力、至今尙未生效、英政府現正考慮採取進一步的辦法、達此目的之可能性、總之、英政府無論如何主張繼續進行、一如現時、並竭其權力務使英國在日軍佔據各區域內之貿易與航業免受偏袒日方或任何他方利益之岐視、據最近所得情報、廣州海關雖未確在日人管理之下、但已在若干程度上受日方之統制、一如上海海關情形、其職員中已增加若干日籍人員矣、海南島海關亦然、廣州海關行政在日軍攻擊廣州及進佔之際、竟得安然無恙、此實當時粤海關副稅務司霍伯氏之勇敢與堅忍、有以致之云、</p>
<p>樸氏繼又追述海南島被佔之各項事實、並舉日外相有田所發日軍佔據該島時期久暫、以軍事需要爲衡之聲明、後稱、渠雖深知此事在軍略上或戰術上之意義、然不能謂英國在該島有眞正重要之關係、惟法政府之地位、無疑的與英國不同、法政府之條的上地位、基於一八九七年中國不以此島讓與他國之擔保、與一九○七年之法日協定、至於英國、則與日本未有此同樣協定、其與此項局勢有關係者、唯華盛頓九國公的耳、斯特拉波奇勳爵所稱日方行動、非志在威脅中政府地位、但欲對於英法政府加以威脅或予焦慮一節渠覺此事難下判語、渠所堪言者、日方所給予英人之理由、即斯特拉波奇勳爵所引日外相有田所發關於軍事情况所需要的時期一語而巳、此語誠甚含混、但此即日政府向英人說明之地位也云、</p>
<p>樸萊茅斯機言及天津局勢謂、天津現狀自一般言之、與渠去年十二月所報吿者相似、英政府巳向日政府明白表示，天津英租界當局方面、未有不合作之意、準備拘捕犯有恐怖行爲或其他罪行之任何人而移交日方、不過須日方提出證明其人之充份證據及罪案確已成立而後可</p>
<p>泛言之、英政府遠東政策以九國公的爲根據、故英政府不憚詞費、已在一月十四日致日政府之牒文中切實聲明、凡以武力造成或以片面行動修改之變更、涉及九國公的條文之破壊或廢止者、英政府不能承認之、而九國公的陳舊失效、或該的條的不復適合局勢之說、英政府亦不能贊同之、今局勢之變更、乃日政府違反該的條款所致也、英政府以爲條的乃永遠的、如日政府或其他任何簽的國對於其所認爲可改善該的之點、提出建設性質之建議、則英政府可準備考慮之、而與其他各簽的國對此修正各點、共同談判之、英政府並準備於和平恢復後、與中政府重開關於領事裁判權之談判、包括上述數點之牒文、雖已於一月十四日送交日政府、然日政府迄今尙未答復、渠頃已言之、依英政府之意見、任何辦法如斯特拉波奇動爵所言者、除非其爲實施有效之計劃未必眞正有益、可解决此種困難、蓋斯特拉波奇勳爵所言之各種經濟裁制辦法、如欲付諸實施、則有凡有關係各方面、須一致同時行動之絕對必要也、英政府曾在極困難情况中、以種種方面援助中政府、渠願下院注意於此、自中日戰爭開始以來、英政府保持香港之開放、以此爲中國交通之途徑、惟廣州陷落後、此路不復可用矣、英國又築路自緬甸通至中國邊界、最近英政府獲有輸出担保案下之權力、而利用之、得對中國予以更便利之担保、總之、英政府無時不考慮一般地位、從不稍去懐也、</p>
<p>人有以可吾以壓力加諸日政府、庶在華戰事得早日結束者、在渠思之、若謂現有能以達此目的之象、則屬困難、且亦錯誤、英政府時常與有關係國、對於關係其共同利益之事件作密切之商榷、以期獲取旣對雙方不失公允、且亦適當顧及第三國利益之解决辦法、英政府並曾通知中日兩國政府、吿以英政府準備隨時運用其調解力量、不憚於時機適當時、採行各種必要步驟、渠現須承認者、自渠去年十二月在上院發言以來、局勢在此點上似未有任何變更、渠不能認爲時機成熟云、斯特萊波奇勳爵聞答詞後、乃向樸萊茅斯道謝、於是此事遂擱置（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英美密切注視　上海租界治安　津租界四週布電綱　英美法對日提抗議</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外次樓萊茅斯勳爵今日在上院答覆斯脫拉波奇勳爵之演說云、英政府現已喚起日政府注意芙方對於現在上海進行之公共租界工部局與日當局之討論甚爲關切之事實、自上海恐怖事件重行活躍以後、日當局即向工部局提出若干建議、要求對於法律與秩序作更有效之維持、英政府對於局勢、繼續予以嚴密之注視、並準備隨時予工部局以可能的勸吿與援助、聞美國大使亦巳提出同樣之交涉云、挨氏又稱、政府對於此類暴動之發生、殊爲扼腕、惟其不能有其他任何消息報吿上院、目下此事巳在上海日當局與工部局討論之中云、樸氏又述及各報所傳南京「維新政府」因公共租界及英法船隻有援助蔣介石將軍之　、巴被迫向彼等宣布靜默的戰爭之消息、謂英政府對此、尙未接獲英大使之任何　實、渠意英政府應靜候接獲關於此事之情報後、再考慮向東京提出交涉之間題、吾人對於此事、應勿忘英政府並未承認南京「維新政府」、對於該政府所發之任何宜言、自無庸過於重視、（一日路透電</p>

<p>（東京）據河內日方消息、越南政府於二月二十五日公佈封閉康盤　、除法國軍艦外、各種船隻不許駛入、察法政府顯係在該灣開始建築防禦工事、其堅固定將與新加坡相埒、（二日路透社電）</p>

<h3>社評　對於敎育之感念</h3>
<p>全國敎育會議旣於本月一日，在重慶如期開慕；聞要案至多，待决於今後數日內之集會。夫敎育乃爲關係全國全族，關係現代後代之大事；非若一界職業，非僅一時措施；况當抗戰建國時代，允負繼往開來使命；則禱祝此會之肩起百年重任，克副各方厚望，宜非記者私願而已。</p>
<p>中國敎育，究以何者爲當前之大問題，如何爲大問題之解决法，凡此有關敎育之專門問題，端賴敎育家以其灼見眞知，研求之，答復之；信賴專家，無取我人辭費。雖然，語及敎育，輒有若千感念焉，起伏胸肊。蓋藐爾小已，雖不厠身敎育界，但自檢立身處世，所受幼年少年各級敎育之影響者如何？回憶當年之學校生活，學校風紀，與師長之敎誨，以及師長之所以相薰陶爲表率者如何？及離學校，入社會，知如何，行如何，學又如何？此皆切身經歷，閱數十年而至今茲，猶聞敎育云云而必引起無窮感念於不能自已者也。目覩親族鄉黨之入學校，或輟學，或畢業，悠悠歲月，心力交瘁，而前前後後皆是問題。子弟須受敎育，於是事前選擇學校，求其敎師學風設備環境納費皆無問題；及既入學，旣虞其不學而學業之惡劣，又虞其好學而沾染之惡劣；嚴格玫之，每每不能無問題；此又事關敎育而不容置身事外，卽不能無所感念於敎育者也。捨小己而他求之：則國外之侵略，乃爲對於國家最嚴重之測騐；而抗戰者，乃就軍事政治經濟，就民族與社會，對於旣往敎育最嚴重之測騐也。顧測騐所得如何？抗戰二十月，民族與社會之長處與弱點畢露；其間究有何種長處，可以歸功於旣往之敎育？其間究有何種弱點，乃爲旣往敎育所得不任其咎？對此問題，姑不爲之縷析；總之，當前情况，使人不假思索而感念於敎育之亟須澈底興革，庶幾有人民焉，克勝復興之大業。</p>
<p>由上論之，問題實大；必赴之以有關敎育之全部知能與力量，如軍事上之總動員；奉行國家之敎育方針，如嚴肅齊一，劍及屨及之軍令；急起直追，如生死須臾，成敗所繫之肉搏；是以敎育革命，完成民族改造；蓋非一手一足之烈，所得而致者矣。若乃求效於小者近者，則有數義，籲請一般人士之前：志不在敎育者，莫視爲利而入敎育界，莫瞰其權而入敎育界，莫以爲過渡，莫以爲消閑，莫以一己時間精力之有餘，補仰事俯畜之不足，而入敎育界，此一也。有志獻身敎育事業者，先察從事敎育之甘苦，體認從事敎育之意義；立志之不足，必修養充沛之學術，允必敦品修身，俾堪師表；有所內愧，不如其已；此二也。旣在敎育界服務者，務具安貧樂道之精神，鍥而不舍，終生以之；務以德性爲人格敎育之本，更孜孜治學，始終站於學術之前綫；對學生自以敎育爲務，對國家允負敎育之責，而以學生不成器爲大恥，爲溺職；此三也。其不在敎育界而與敎育事業爲緣者，倡導敎育，助長敎育，是無論矣；顧必先尊重師資，母以政治或商業，乃至敎育性質以外之其他一切舉措，毀損敎師，汚辱敎育；亦母以任何原因理由與動機，誘致良好之敎師，脫離敎育，此四也。此四者，以視莊嚴偉大之整個敎育問題，誠似無關宏旨，然一般人士而能接納此四端，則不但敎育空氣可以澄淸，亦深信必能增進敎育效能者也。</p>

<h3>香港感受威脅　英方增防邊境　當局頒發海軍防務法令</h3>
<p>香港通訊、最近一週來、侵粤日軍、不斷向香港邊境肆行威脅、此中動機及目的、凡熟悉國際及遠東形勢者、當能知之、茲將港地近况、分誌如下、</p>
<p>邊界形勢　自廢歷年中珠江口太平方面之日軍突向與九龍邊界相聯接之南頭進攻、並派飛機轟炸深圳後英國政府、即向日方提出嚴重抗議、是以進攻南頭之日軍、於刦掠之後、即行撤退、詛知二十日消息，日軍叫百、父於是日淸晨佔領南頭、並放火焚燒縣公署及各機關、幸城內婦孺早巳疎散、因而死傷者尙少、同時駐於該地之海關職員、亦完全退入英界、又悉日本飛機、速、在深圳上空來往盤桓、投彈轟炸、致使深圳居民、逃避一空、即英界方面住民、亦紛紛遷避他處、據此以觀、可知日軍之威脅香港、純粹出於有計劃的行動、並不因英國之交涉抗議而有所歛跡、</p>
<p>實彈演習　因此之故、香港軍事當局雖極力鎭靜忍耐、但爲防範於萬一計業已發佈命令、訓令駐紮新界方面之邊防軍開始作種種準備、必要時可採取自衛行動、邊防軍奉令後、業已遵照一切、故自昨日起、新界中英邊界各要隘、形勢顯呈緊張、同時砲台方面、亦速日日夜演習、二十五日下午自六時起至半夜止、白沙環砲台、即舉行實彈大演習、一時砲聲隆隆、一若戰神之業已降臨、又據消息、倫敦方面最近亦已頒到一「香港海軍防務法令、」授權英海軍部於必要時、得接受香港政府之請求、調集香港海軍義勇隊、正式加入英國海軍服務、一如英國之正規海軍、以充實香港海軍之戰鬥力、</p>
<p>日軍圖窺瓊島中部</p>
<p>桂軍奉令開欽廉駐防</p>
<p>徐聞等縣已宣布戒嚴</p>
<p>瓊崖戰事刻仍在混戰中、華軍爲戰略起見、引其深入、日軍步騎千餘聞已佔福山、有進窺瓊島中部企圖、然愈深入、則困難愈多、據瓊島難民稱、現在瓊島華軍尙保存相當實力、各縣自衛團及壯丁巳集合各險要地區、以逸待勞、利用山地爭戰、减却日空軍及唐克車效力、同時華軍事前巳有充份準備、糧食子彈、準備充足、</p>
<p>瓊山等縣一片焦土</p>
<p>目前侵瓊日軍計劃、先佔據沿海口岸、以斷華軍接濟、故在海口市·楡林港·及淸瀾港等處先後登陸、淸瀾港一股、刻進犯瓊東縣之嘉積市、經華軍猛烈反擊、尙無法進展、日軍所到瓊山澄邁等縣、大肆搶掠、難民在途者、更遭慘無人道之日機追擊、海口人民疏散之際、被槍斃者不下叫五百名、致道旁遺屍纍纍、無人檢拾、海口市從前爲繁盛之區、現因在日軍鐵蹄下、居民散逃者有十份之七八、市况蕭條、日軍雖嗾使奸徒級織僞維持會、然因陸路交通梗塞、平日由各地開往海口之船隻、亦完全停駛、糧食恐慌、消息中斷、市民一時未克離海口者近已相繼他徙、至瓊山·文昌·定安各縣縣城、經日機轟炸後、民房店舖多燬於火、商業停頓、各圩鎭多陷入混亂狀態、難民有繞道赴北海、然後乘輪赴廣州灣或東京灣者、亦有避地至港澳者、</p>
<p>各縣戒嚴疏散人口</p>
<p>最近日海陸空軍在海南迭有增援、計有日砲艦·巡洋艦·運輸艦、共不下四十艘、航空母艦兩艘、旂艦一艘、陸戰隊及臺灣雜脾軍不下二萬入、瓊州海峽已成爲日軍所控制、海口市本與雷州半島相對、海口一失、雷州海峽之徐聞縣、備受日空軍威脅即海康縣屬各海港、亦風聲鶴唳、各縣縣當局已奉令頒佈戒嚴令、疏散人民、遷徙糧食、毀壊公路、沿海增設步哨、徐聞一縣因迫近瓊島、人口疏散最多、店戶十室九空、城廂由自衛團壯丁隊維持治安、對於沿岸監視允嚴、凡入口旅客、須經嚴密檢査、方准入境、至日機飛至徐聞偵察者、則幾無虛日、城內外被炸地點多至十餘處、災區遼闊、</p>
<p>欽廉緊張桂軍增防</p>
<p>此外因瓊島陷落、而失去屛障之欽廉兩屬、近又頓呈緊張局面、一部日艦及飛機連日不斷向北海等處觀伺、　洲日艦數艘曾駛往距離冠頭嶺附近海面開砲轟擊、翌日叉有日巡艦開到欽縣海面、測量水道、欽廉防軍近已加緊戒備、桂省當局以欽廉密邇桂邊、該地如有警、南寗等處將被牽動、特於日昨由桂抽調勁旅開至欽廉增防、欽縣公路早已分段掘斷、桂邊某某等要隘、更有機械化部隊扼守、至北海沿岸易爲日艦大砲射程所及、當局已妥善準備、日來北海至香港之輪船、雖照常來往、然旅客减少、貨物更少販運、由香港開赴北海之船隻、現不經瓊州海口、抵北海時、祇運輸少許肉類、供給香港日常之用而巳、</p>
<p>受華南軍事影響　香港貿易由盛而衰</p>
<p>怪機八架闖入港九上空</p>
<p>香港通訊、自日軍侵入華南、香港四週、均遭包圍後、此不列顚帝國在最近遠東之殖民地、即大受威脅、最近更因日軍在海南島之登陸、香港在英國遠東軍事上經濟上之價値、亦大爲减退、矧廢曆新年中日軍日機、不斷侵入香港邊境及領空、甚至公然在英國界內投彈、轟炸火車、此事之發生、顯爲日方有意向英國示威、對香港施予軍事壓力、不料一波未平、一波又起、據可靠消息、二月二日上午三時、忽有怪機八架、掠過港九上空、於是無形中驟呈緊張、</p>
<p>加緊空防</p>
<p>據有關方面洩出消息、謂二十二日深晚三時左右、港九上空、忽發現一陣軋軋震耳之機聲、甚感淸晰、隨即有人目睹有飛機八架、在層雲中結隊飛翔、的數分鐘後、機影即吿消失、當時九龍方面、見者較多、於是消息所播、聞者均斷定此八架來歷不明之怪飛機、當係日機無疑、從來一般人對於香港空防、均信爲萬無一失、今竟有此怪機無端闖人、當局及警察方面、對於此事一面諱莫如深、一面則加否認、蓋恐因此動搖人心、陷社會於不安、惟防空當局、則由主任史提露柏堅士在報端發表公開談話、表示香港防空設備、正在加緊佈置中、最新式之警報機七架、亦由英國運來即將裝於港九適當之大厦上、並謂在最近期內、將再舉行燈火管制、弦外之音、當極明顯、</p>
<p>商業衰退</p>
<p>軍事上之重重威脅、巳使香港人士、大爲不安、同時經濟上所受之打擊、亦因日軍之佔領廣州、進攻瓊崖而日趨深刻、蓋香港商業之繁榮、全繫於華南沿海之交通自華南戰興、香港與各地交通發生阻礙以來、香港之入口貿易、首遭嚴重之打擊、此即說明英美貨物、在華南已無市塲之可言、據日前香港當局所公佈之貿易統計、一九三九年（即今年）一月份香港之入口總値、共爲四千萬零七十高元、較諸一九三八年（即去年）同時期之入口總値六千三百七十萬元、相差竟有二千三百萬元之巨、至於出口方面、因去年港商存貨由積、今年盡力廉價推銷、故總値爲四千零二十萬元、較去年同期之三千九百四一萬元增加二百萬元、但其中對華甫各地之出口額、僅爲二百三十萬元、較去年同期之一千零五十萬元、竟减少至八百萬元、此亦足以說明今年一月份香港運至中國內地之洋貨銳减同時香港對華南之入口貨物、一月份亦僅計四百九十萬元、較去年同時期减去百分之六十以上、近來日軍進攻瓊崖、並有進犯粤南北海之企圖、如北海方面戰爭繼起、則香港與內地貿易、勢將完全斷絕、是以據有關方面觀察、今年度香港商業、將迅速衰退、回復全三年前之不景氣情景、實大有可能、是則香港當前經濟命運之悲慘、與軍事上之感受威脅、絕無分別也、</p>

<p>上海敎育界　改革敎育意見</p>
<h3>對於戰後中等敎育改革的幾點意見（二）  張文昌</h3>
<p>第二因一般家長經濟必更困難故减低收費與加多公費免費與工讀學額外、更可推行畢季制、以一年分爲四季、除暑季六週作補習外、其餘秋冬春三季、每季十四週、照本人去年五月至七月在華東聯合中學辦、短期實騐班之經騐、十四星期可以修畢普通一學期之學程、現行高初中六年之圓周制課程、殊多浪費與重複、例如史地·理科·算舉·國文等敎材頗多重複處、倘能重行編制、由淺入深、删繁採要、加入時代材料、編配學期二十週之材料於十四週中、注重練習、應用與實騐、則所得者、亦不致有生吞活剝之弊、前幾年國府要人中有提議廢置假期編短修學年限、前年敎育部曾令少數中學實騐六年中學五年完畢、現縮短年限、人同此心、允其在經費困難、需才孔急之戰後中國、用學季制以代學期制、則六年中學四年可以完畢、如有少數程度低劣者、留級亦祇一季、時間亦殊經濟、再有一二科不及格者、更可在暑季中補習後補試、</p>
<p>第三職業敎育因建設孔急而更需要、故除高等敎育之職業科外、中等學校亦需訓練大批職業界下幹部人員、但職業學校設備與師資非常難辦到滿意地步、此點可用半工半讀制度以救濟之、利用工廠·農塲·醫院之設備與技師、則設備與師資之困難可以解决、工廠得此學徒式之學生、則將來招收爲職員必更滿意而熟悉、學校內仍可有普通基礎科目、及職業理論科目、使學理與實際溝通、高級學生可以稍有工資或進益以彌補生活費、藉此减輕家長之負担、此種學校年限可以稍長、然經騐可以加增不少、畢業後不致除升學外別無辦法矣、第四普通學科在今日之中等學校中於國英算之基礎工具科目效能殊欠高、其故在目標龐雜、材料太深練習太少、故有每况愈下之勢、其故除敎村之選擇問題外、即在自習時間之缺少與指導之不得當、甚至一無指導、如現行之半日制者、挽救之道乃在實行嚴格精密之自學輔導、其法有二種、一爲集中半日於輔導（另半天爲上課）排定主耍科之自習時間、有專科敎員分級分組巡迥指導、解答問題、練習指定、演習答題等等高材生亦可派至各小組中作組長、負答較易問題、如此可使不及格學生减少、熟練而深入、一爲分科在課內自習、由原敎員輔導原指定之作業、有上課時間稍長、劃分爲兩小節、上級上課、下一節自修，如各四十分鐘或三十分鐘是、倘學科多而不及支配者可擇主要科、或甚至一星期定一二天實行之、有用五十分一節內、上課三十分至三十五分鐘、餘下廿分或一刻鐘作擇要之自習指導、使主要困難、已在原敎員指導下解决、則學生自習時已不若前之困難矣、</p>
<p>第五中等學校不宜單集中於都市、鄕鎭村縣亦應普及則使中等學生不必跋涉離家、同時學校亦熟悉鄉村社會情形而能適應、中等學校下鄕爲戰後必然途徑、方可使中國生機種於每個鄕村中、但有一困難、即學生稀少因中國鄕村是小村制、且初等敎育尙未普及、故初設時亦宜選擇人口較密地點適中之鄉村或縣鎭設立之、學生不多、可用同學年之複式制或多學年之複式制、但組數不宜多至二組以上、則二種不同之程度、可在有經騐敎員之指導下不浪費時間、問答與自修同時進行、且如行此制、則仍可招收春季生、與秋季生複式敎學·不致因人少而發生困難、</p>
<p>末了、我們耍知道、如何能實行上列改革端在敎師之得人、今後中國敎育不在改變制度與學制系統、而在師資之訓練與保持、敎育部近設師範學院、給以五年之訓練、除普通科與基本敎育科外、特重科與專業訓練、誠爲善策、人格訓練以導師制行之、則中等敎育之改進可拭目而待、然此種人才訓練成功在數年之後、且未必即能普及、故此後五年十年中、在職敎師之進修、亦屬非常重要、顧一般在職敎師對於進修恒不甚熱心、其求進步認識固屬一因、但困於家務與經費亦屬大原因、故自然學校預算內、應多加一個、半個、或三分之一敎員的薪金、使每年或二年或每三年有一敎員可輪替到帥範學院之進修班進修一年、在離職期內、仍領原薪、則敎員方面無後顧之憂、則學業之進取必更有効騐、質之敎靑行政者、以爲如何、（完）</p>

<p>深盼各界嚴密注意</p>
<p>戰後上海失業靑年爲數甚衆、彼輩雖生活極苦、但仍堅志不移或賴投稿以生活、或在報端多方微職、不料僞組織方面、利用機會肆行惡計、用刊物名義、在報端刊載廣吿、徵求稿件、或用公司商號名義、招請翻譯文書等職、通訊處借信箱或越界築路地點、失業靑年見之、以爲求生之機會已至、紛紛嘗試、其實此中主持者全爲僞組織份子、用以吸收靑年、倘應徵者不知、彼輩乃用惡毒計劃、派員前往接洽、甘言利誘、或威脅恫騙、無所不用其極、如最近之「中國與日本」月刊及某某公司等、即爲一例、深盼失業靑年密切注意、勿入其彀云、（上海社）</p>

<h3>李惠堂三射三中　港足球勝菲記　馬尼拉四比一慘敗　鮑賽利不如李大王</h3>
<p>（香港通訊）香港馬尼拉從來未有之第一次埠際足球賽、於十八日下午在海軍球塲、結果港隊以四比一大勝、菲島慘遭敗北、觀者滿坑滿谷、的計七八千人之譜、</p>
<p>菲不如港</p>
<p>港隊前鋒、如果能充份利用其所有極好機會、則中球紀錄、當不止此數、表演以兩內鋒及後衛綫最佳、兩翼侯澄滔及阜拉則完全减色、阜拉雖射中第四球、但射而不中者、不計其數、馬尼拉選手、雖動作甚爲敏捷、但其對球之管束能力及戰略、相差遠甚、左內鋒鮑塞利、爲菲隊全軍之靈魂、對本隊前鋒綫、球之供給、準確無比、但鮑塞利孤掌難鳴、徒見菲前鋒功虧一簣、被李天生施漢、從容將球遠掃也、菲隊採用第三後衛法、常用中堅姚吉地退後守衛、於是中軍前綫指揮重任、集中於鮑塞利一人、但港隊之中衛綫旣異常堅强、加以馮景祥大吿山奴左右爲輔、故全軍推進之力、異常可畏、大部份時間、球在菲隊門前槃旋也、此中塲之優勢、亦爲菲不如港之一點、</p>
<p>球王鐵腿</p>
<p>李惠堂、港隊隊長兼中鋒　任、前鋒之球、羣向李氏傳來、蓋球王之腿、一發必中也、固然、港隊一連三球、皆球王鐵腿所中、其第一與第三球、射球之力、允爲可畏、皆在二十碼外、力掃進門、第二球之中、則得大吿山奴之傳送、時菲隊僅守門孤軍獨撑、李氏一舉而中、前鋒綫中、除李氏外、馮景祥與大告山奴亦偉大功臣、努力爲中鋒造成種種機會、允以大吿山奴、攻守俱佳、滿塲飛奔、活動萬分、中綫三傑、狄臣坐鎭中原、梁榮照韓尼維路左右爲輔、李天生及施漢之後衛更如鐵壁銅牆、因此譚均幹、雖被陷一城、幾於無門可守、生意冷洛、僅得若干射球而已、</p>
<p>機會可惜</p>
<p>港方失去之機會無數、令人惋惜、開賽之五分鐘、阜拉得一極佳機會、但竟射中門上橫木、侯澄滔一决離門僅五碼之地、亦竟射出門外、其射門之减色、爲從來未有者、馮景祥則過於謹愼、得球即送給惠堂、甚至自己在射門之極好地位中、亦必轉送李大哥、因惠堂在對方嚴重監視之下、故若干好機會、亦不無被景祥之過度小心而斷送也、菲隊中堅姚吉地、擔任看守李惠堂、寸步不離、在港方進攻時、則退居第三後衛、但惠堂洞燭其奸、並不隨之推進、結果姚吉地常因之無人可監視、左前衛華理斯甚佳、使港翼阜拉殊少活動、兩後衛米蘭打、巴戚高動作甚快、但在緊張之時、缺少鎭靜、守門堯俄前三球之失、皆無法挽救者、第四球阜拉之球則得而復失也、</p>
<p>惠堂三箭</p>
<p>開球後之五分鐘內、港隊即取攻勢、於是你來我往、港方顯佔優勢、嗣港隊推進、得一角球、侯澄滔踢米、球恰落門前、李惠堂提足開砲、砰然入網、港隊繼續進攻、但雖有若于機會、皆未能再有進展、上半時即以一比零結束、下半時開賽後僅一分鐘、大吿山奴自臬都脚下截獲傳中與李惠堂向球門直逼近門一脚、又中鵠的、成二比零、菲隊反攻殊烈、二分鐘後、右翼雷也斯果然奪回一球、追成二比一、下半時已去其半、李惠堂又射中第三箭、此球以左足射入、美妙無匹、港隊旣極對佔優、比賽亦漸見鬆弛、終塲前數分鐘、阜拉在困難之角度中、射中最後之第四球、</p>

<p>浦東日軍、迭遭慘敗後、連日乃派出飛機二三架不等、飛往恐嚇偵察、允以舊歷正月初六新塲鎭一役慘敗奇重、遊擊隊亦有傷亡、日軍雖在王姓更樓上頑抗、佈設電網激戰通宵、卒被遊擊隊將工事悉數破壊而去、事後日軍對南匯縣大團鎭、作爲目標、而遊擊隊各支大隊長、茲又計劃全力將侵入奉南川三縣邊界之殘餘日軍驅出、惟總攻之時、日軍在敗北後、顯將不擇手段荼毒後方、甚且藉口縣政府關係、而害及非戰鬥員之民衆、故議决將南匯縣政府遷於不著名及外鄉人不能達到之處、前日各科已經完全搬竣、而川沙縣政府亦已遷離合慶鎭、務使漢奸無法指引、日機無法施其伎倆、現聞浦東方面、遊擊隊聯絡已經成功、大戰在元宵節邊、顯將開始、</p>

<h3>江灣路炸彈爆炸　炸斃日人四名　另有二人各受重傷</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（二日）日文大陸新報載稱、萬國商團靶子塲後四分之一哩處之東江灣路全泰木器公司工塲、已毀於砲火、瓦礫堆中埋有未曾確定何種形式之炸彈一枚、於星期三日（一日）午後爆發、</p>
<p>炸斃日人</p>
<p>四名、重傷二名、內計成人四人、孩童二人、彼等結隊游歷江灣戰塲、至該前工塲之地、駐足觀看、中有石川洋者、年十五歲、檢起該爆炸物、加以察看後、墜於地上、乃起可怖之爆炸、某過路者瞥見該已毀之工塲中捲起濃重黑烟、奔往該地、見</p>
<p>可怖景象</p>
<p>蓋一人已死、餘五人受傷、臥地輾轉呻吟、日木海軍陸戰隊士兵得訊、急用救護車將傷者飛送福民醫院、其中三人抵院後、立即斃命、經認明殞生者、爲紫竹宰雄·紫竹澈志·松原省一·石川洋均居豐樂里三十八號、傷者爲佐籐悟之與松原省一之女、佐籐</p>
<p>來滬未久</p>
<p>今日方已開始調査爆炸物之性質、聞共彈徑爲三公分、長的十公分、據信非舊砲彈即手溜彈、日領署警務部巳通吿公衆、注意爆炸地四週區域之危險性、</p>
<h3>連續發生爆炸案後　租界嚴密戒備　各方觀察暴行係有組織行動　捕房對拾獲彈片正精密研究</h3>
<p>前晚公共租界熱鬧市區之南京路等處、於一小時內連續發生炸彈案四起後、警務當局爲界內治安計、對此非常重視、現正嚴密偵查中、一面復加緊防範工作、以免同樣不幸事件之續發、據向各方探悉、此項暴行、顯然係有組織之行動、目的擾亂租界治安、借題發揮、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>各方觀察暴行目的</p>
<p>據各方對用京路等處炸彈案件觀察如下、（一）自上月底公共租界區連續發生「恐怖事件」後、當局爲維持界內治安、在預防方面、積極增强、堵塞里弄、檢查行人車輛各項警務上必要設施、已决第進行、决無不智之愛國份子在此警備嚴密現狀下、再發生恐怖行動、（二）迭决恐怖事件之發生、均係有目的有對象而行之、决不在熱鬧市區、行人叢中、亂擲炸彈、徒傷無辜（三）三月一日晚之炸彈案計有四起之多、自下午九時二十七分起至十時三十分止、在一小時間連續發生、則故意擾亂界內治安、毫無疑義、更可窺測此種暴行、顯然有組織之行動、其蛛絲馬跡、不難索解、</p>
<p>租界當局嚴密偵查</p>
<p>自三月一日晚、南京路·英華街·虞洽卿路·靜安寺路·等處發生炸彈案後租界當局雖未將關係是案之嫌疑人犯拘獲、惟對此項暴行、非常重視、現悉各管轄區之捕房、曾將檢得之彈片及與是案有關之各種證件、詳細硏究中、一面密派探員、分佈各重要區域塲所、嚴密偵查、至於防務方面、亦於昨日下午一時起、各公共塲所均分駐便衣探捕、隨時注意各方人士之動態、入晚各熱閙馬路、戒備允嚴、法租界各捕房、亦於昨日起、在各馬路要道及車站、派駐探捕檢查行人乘客、以防不良份子混入界內、</p>
<p>無塲所在尤加注意</p>
<p>公共租界南京路前晚連續發生炸彈案後、昨日防務更形加嚴、新雅酒樓與冠生園食品公司附近探捕紛立、且有日捕站立門前守衛、所有炸彈爆發之地點、若大新·國泰·大東·東亞·仙樂等、均爲舞塲所在地、因而捕房對於舞塲、已特別警戒、當出事之夜、附近舞塲悉由捕房勒令至午夜十二時停業、但有多家舞塲週六通宵營業、以後是吾亦加禁止、則尙未悉、</p>
<p>西報所載日方言論</p>
<p>大陸報云、日本陸海軍與領署警務部代表、昨日（一日）午前十時甫過、復訪工部局當局、由警務長波爾恩與副警務長史密斯及吉爾勃接見、會談歷三小時之久、日方代表、於午後一時始離局、雖悉所談注重於公共租界內之恐怖份子行動與警務處目前所取戒備、但昨日未有關於日方代表此行之文吿發表、昨晚日方接待外籍記者、亦未宣佈會談之詳情、日大使館發言人稱、吾人僅能謂彼等會就公共租界之警務交換意見、至於會談時曾吾論及界外區域與僞方管理區域之警務、該發言人亦不之知</p>
<p>某記者詢</p>
<p>警務長波爾恩與日當局曾吾商得同意、發言人答稱、此非同意之問題、僅交換意見而已、某記者詢、法租界與日方當局會吾就恐怖事件而交換意見、發言人答、並未發生關於法租界警務之問題、昨日發言人應某記者數日前之請而宣佈云、自本年一月一日至二月二十二日、上海日領署警務當局曾記錄得政治</p>
<p>恐怖案件</p>
<p>五十七起、據發言人所得情報、此等案件、對華人而發者、計四十九起、對日人而發者八起、而狙擊華人之案件中、發生於公共租界者三十六起、公共租界以外者八起、法租界者五起、至於對日人而發之恐怖企圖、計公共租界內外各四起、某記者詢、此等案件、是吾</p>
<p>悉屬政治</p>
<p>恐怖主義之行動、大使館發言人答、渠之情報、盡如上述、又詢能吾確知所稱公共租界內恐怖主義之行動、是吾均發生於公共租界內、抑有若干恐怖案件發生於界外馬路旁僞方管理之里街內、舌人答稱、發言人頗爲忙碌、不遑調查之、旋復稱、據所得消息、在上述期間、曾有對</p>
<p>華人而發</p>
<p>之恐怖案件三十六起、對日人而發者四起、均發生於公共租界警務管轄之區域內、某記者涉及同盟社近自南京發出之消息而詢、南京方面宜稱、自日軍進佔以來、曾有對「維新政府」人昌而發之恐怖案一百起、旣如上言、則共中五十餘起均發生於僞區域中乎、發言人答渠未悉是項消息、須待渠得更詳細之情報後、始得討論此點云、</p>

<h3>早婚與晚婚的弊害觀</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科楊道南</p>
<p>富拉夸說：「少年夫婦所生的小兒，猶如冬天煖室裏面養成栽培所得的水菓，柔嫩而沒有味道，」這話最切中早婚的弊端。所以早婚的小兒，強健的很少，至於我國早婚原因，只因父母望孫太切，以爲有孫兒，父母死去，便得人祭祀，這是大大錯誤。所以我們應注重的，不是要多生，乃是要優生。</p>
<p>論到晚婚，也有弊害，男子到三十五歲以後結婚，活潑的熱情，已經大半消亡，體力和性情，也逐漸萎弱，對於結婚的快樂，既減退不少，子女多未成人，爲父的已鬚髮班白，不能盡撫養的責任，女子晚年出嫁，生殖器多障碍，容易息難產和「歇斯的里」症。</p>
<p>夫婦年齡，相差過遠，體力和性情不同，常爲家庭不和陸的原因，例如男子過老，女子過少，則男子勉強滿足女子的性愛，終身致於身心衰弱，釀成發育不全等症的疾病。男女同年，或女大於男，在結婚時雖然沒有什麼影嚮，但是後來一比較，女子已經衰老，男子尚年富力強，也爲家庭不和陸的原因。</p>
<p>講到夫婦間的愛情，當以生理成熟而不荒淫者爲最幸福。爲荒淫者其精力定必渙散，多腎虧毛病，同時夫若年老，則精力有減弱現象，此亦伉儷間失歡原因之一。</p>
<p>有了此種毛病的，確是家庭不睦的主因，可是現代醫學進步，競以研究動物睪丸內分泌作其治療性弱的基本方策。其中最有功效者，首推德國梅倫博士所發明之雄壯動物靑春腺素製劑「補體康」了。因其除採取猩猩，牡鹿，及犢牛中之睪丸精質外，並滲入礦植物中之名貴補品，提煉則在紫光電下充分運用最新式科學方法故主要純粹質地完全保存，而補救抵抗得宜，致能發揮充分效果，在治療性機能障碍之藥品中，無有出其右者。</p>
<p>今日醫學家對於性弱一症之治療，都推崇該劑之藥力，良由該劑功能積極助長幼時骨骼與筋肉發育，並能解除神經衰弱，促進生育機能，補腦，補腎。並掃除損害身體的物質變成無害物質，專理新陳代謝力，使身心返老還童，恢復愉快而叉活潑的生命。依鄙人的實騐觀察，一個年已六旬老者，連服三盒「補體康」後，氣喘及失眠症完全消失，並能安步當車，全不覺乏力，足證其效力之一班矣。其女用（補體康」功能調經種子，促進乳峯發育，爲婦科聖藥。</p>
<h3>遺精的健康途徑</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>講到遺精一症的治法，自當必須嚴守攝生，此與治療上影響非淺，蓋每因息者不知攝生，雖由富有經騐之醫師治療，亦覺難以爲力；致病象惡化者，不一而足，故患者不思治療則己，如欲速求健康，在攝養上應當萬分留意才是。攝養方法，如有自瀆癖者，須堅决戒除之，身體與精神勿過勞，忌飲酒遲睡，在飲食上宜擯絕酸辣等品，整理大小便，勿閱讀淫書淫晝，淸心寡慾，頗有益於治療，故患者不妨採行。</p>
<p>余十數年來基於治療千萬患者的臨床經騐，藥劑中之最對症者，首推法國生理學家耐而斯博士所發明之「耐而斯遺精片」爲最佳，因該劑所含之成分，確具鞏固精關，安靜大腦，調整內分泌機能之功，氏在法國領有政府之榮譽獎狀，故該劑確非一般粗製濫造者可比。此外之電療，冷水摩擦等療法，祗可作爲輔助而已，因功效無該藥之卓絕，市上其他各種之固精片，允無一顧之價值，我國靑年之患遺精者允夥，今特鄭重忠吿，若欲速復健康，捨此實無他途。</p>

<h3>治淋最高峯之統計</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>不談理論，只談實際，因爲理論固然是事實的說明。在事實上淋病處此科學萬能之時代，確不足慮。因淋病之療法，日新而月異，與昔日之面貌，大異其趣。此於最近治療淋病，允可證明。原來治療淋病，貴能以沈着堅忍之精神，逐步應付。切忌躁急求功。妄用覇藥。蓋淋菌賦性頑強，非按步就班，勦撫兼施，不克除淋務盡，縱能貪功於一時，而不旋踵病毒再發，且引起併發併發各部炎症，後息無窮。</p>
<p>最近歐美各國，對於淋病的治療，己起一種新的變化，。即一致擁護淋病特效「克淋儂」是也。並有新穎的統計，普通急性淋病，服此藥四五瓶即可全愈。遠年老淋病，及攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，膀胱炎等，進服「克淋儂」至七八瓶左右，未有不全愈者。但間有例外，亦屬少數。且又有服用不出半打，多收全效者。據鮑邇遜博士之統計，自德國發明「克淋儂」一藥後，服此藥而被治愈者，占百分之九十八以上。慢性者亦有百分之九十三名根治不發。此在淋病治騐之成績上，達到最高峯之成績。石勒博士並會將「克淋儂」一藥與其他新出品之藥較其功效。則一般新出品的藥劑，不及「克淋儂」一藥遠甚，所以「克淋儂」能歷久彌新，與一般藥劑之今日言新，明日言舊者，大相逕庭。每個淋病患者如服用其他藥劑不愈，服「克淋儂」無不根治也。</p>
<p>淋病講座</p>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>診所：寧波路九號四川路口</p>
<h3>無痛的白濁</h3>
<p>白濁一症，與橫痃下疳，同以痛苦著稱於花柳界，而占首席，此只要患過淋病者，無有不首肯余言也。雖然一般病家，在急性淋時，固然終日惶惶不知所措，惟一過此等急性淋時，痛苦即漸漸減少，病人之注意力，亦隨淋病之減退消失，甚至以爲此病即巳自然獲愈，而依然我行我素，實極危險之事。而實際上淋病息者，每隨白濁之痛苦而加深，爲淋毒性攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等。俱先後爆發。故此種無痛之白濁，實較有痛之白蜀，危險多多，是無可諱言之事也</p>
<p>因此，對此種無痛之白濁，不可不採取有效之措置。在余所經騐過無數之病人中，對於此症之療法，惟德國靜電療法，及X線療法，交相爲用，並內服舉世公認之淋病聖藥「克淋儂」作爲內服劑，將深入內部之淋菌，徹底予以解决，决無絲毫病根殘留以致再發之事　診時上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角。</p>
<h3>肺病毋憂！</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>肺病發現咯血，雖可使病者大吃一驚，但此並非絕對死症。因此余在臨症上，勸吿病家，請其絕對攝生，積極服以德國出品肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，確有搜癆補肺之功。因此劑有直接撲滅癆菌，及消痰鎭咳凝血之效，並能解除潮熱盜汗，各期肺病，均可根治。</p>

<h3>僞「市府」經濟恐慌　傳筱庵遭壓迫　僞「維新政府」有意爲難　近傳下臺另委爪牙充任</h3>
<p>僞「市府」自取消僞「消費稅」後、大鬧經濟恐慌、茲二月份已吿終、裁「員」减「薪」、撤消附屬組織、風潮滋多、未來僞「府」命運、更臻悲慘可怖之境、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>黃金時代　查去歲蘇錫文時代之僞「督辦公署」時期內、每月可收僞「消費稅」四十五萬元至五十萬元、而僞署」及各僞「局」實際開支、僅需四十萬元、按月尚可如商店式之贏餘五萬元至十萬元、此爲僞組織之黃金時代、自傳筱庵眼紅登臺、改組爲僞「市府」後、因圖擴大地盤、每月預算、突增至六十萬元、於是入不敷出、黃金時代、頓成過去、</p>
<p>裁員減薪　此决僞「維新政府」更以一道僞「命」迫傅筱庵將三十八種「消費稅」取消、惟允自二月份起、按月津貼僞「府」四十萬元、上月終、此項津貼分文未得、始知受愚、乃不得不出於裁「員」減「薪」一途、所有僞「府」僞「局」及各僞「科」大小僞員、（除僞「局長」僞「科長」外）一律視工作繁簡、分別淘汰、最多者栽去十分之四、耶未被排斥者、亦一律減「薪」、各僞「局長」僞「薪」照舊、各僞「科長」每人僅減二十元、僞「科員」以前起碼一百元、現減爲八十元、僞「辦事員」昔爲六十元、現減爲四十元·四十五元·五十元·三級、僞「書記」昔爲四十元、現一律減爲三十元·三十五元·四十元·三級、因僞市長僞局長僞秘書等均未減薪、故小僞員認爲待遇不平，暗中呌駡不已、</p>
<p>僞府命運　傅筱庵此决被迫大舉裁員之後、此外又撤消若干附屬組織、如四郊各僞「履仁醫院、僞「施療所」、僞「救火會」等、預算經此一舉、每月可減省開支十萬元、惟至少尚須每月支出五十高元、方能維持、而「維新」每月津貼四十萬元、既巳絕望、本月份又毫無收入、故僞「府」未來命運、將臻更悲慘可怖之境、聞傳筱庵連日愁眉深鎖、頗有悔不當初、做人走狗之慨、</p>
<p>迫傳下臺　惟據熟知僞組織內幕者談、僞「維新」並未實踐四十萬元津貼諾言、一方面固爲經濟困難、自顧不追、另一方面、則爲僞「維新」、對傳不滿、亦係一因、緣傳自粉墨登場以來、一切夜郎自大、迭與僞「維新」發生權利上之衝突最顯著者、爲倚仗背景勢力、擴大地盤、（按「僞府」計畫、擬將近郊十縣、一併攫回、」叉如與「江蘇僞省府」互爭嘉定一縣與南京「僞司法行政部」互爭上海僞「法權」、均使梁鴻志輩引爲不快者、故此次欲與傳倒蛋、使其無法應付、迫而下豪、再行另委爪牙充任、日前盛傳傳將調任僞「南京市政督辦」之說、亦即此故、</p>

<h3>金融　北方投機商尙在猛進　現金價先漲後跌</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖無過大起伏、但情勢頗形條忽、大致先堅而後轉疲、初因某　客代北方投機商大量搜購、兼某銀樓亦代本地帮跟踪購買、故潛勞一度頗堅、後以外匯略報鬆硬、且各方人心本疲、一般散戶紛紛脫售、反動綫疲、結果僅軋跌一元、交易上午尙旺而下午則清、共計八百兩交易、銀樓飾金仍未見史動、海關金暨中英純金等向上升、</p>
<p>烚赤暗盤軋跌一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初無做開、迨至十時許、始見某掮客代北方客帮進錢兌業五十兩、二千一百三十元爲開盤價、與上日未分軒輊、開後因某掮客搜購愈殷、加以某銀樓代本地帮跟踪吸購、故雖有某余號吐售、但以一時頭寸仍感求過於供、逐步上升、錢兌業進金號五十兩、價三十一元、繼之某掮客亦進金號一百五十兩三十二元、後相同價又進現金號五十兩、未幾某銀樓亦代本地幫進余號一百兩、及同業五十兩價相同、俄而某銀樓吸進後忽又復吐予某掮客五十兩價三十三元、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩三十五元、某掮客再進證券帮五十兩三十七元、此後外滙稍鬆、人心頓向下游、賣戶活躍、進者甚缺、跌勢頗厲、錢兌業互做五十兩三十二元、後錢兌業售予銀樓帮五十兩二十八元爲午收價、午後因外滙呆定逾恒、目雙方供求益稀、致成交寥落、首由錢兌業互做五十兩二十八元、後錢兌業售予金號五十兩二千一百二十九元爲晚收價、結果比上日軋跌一元、全天九元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百四十元、收進二千一百二十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金兌價仍未更動</p>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出仍未見更動、大同行仍懸二百十六元、新同行爲二百十四元、收進二百零八元、</p>
<p>英純金績漲二便士</p>
<p>三月一日倫敦電、英純金繼續高昂、每盎司又漲二辦士、升達七鎊八先令五辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦漲達一千二百十一元六角、掛牌海關金亦升二厘、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦隨漲一元三角、計一千二百零六元九角、</p>
<p>貼現率無軒輊</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、市勢重見呆定、每千元終爲卅七元二角半、與前日價無軒輊、</p>
<p>回平、近午洋行吸進外行安達港滙九十四元三七五、爲狀亦極穩乎、午收銀行賣債英美兩滙均與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市港電復來拋塞、再與匯豐相繼售予華商紗花帮英金八辨士一二五、兼之美滙十五元八七五、繼之某洋行吸進麥加利某行英金八辨士一二五、及美匯十五元八七五、是以過程鮮少變動、最後洋行又扒結華比港滙五十四元三七五、爲狀仍平、晚收銀行賣價英滙八辨士一二五、美滙十五元八七五、結果較之前收英美兩滙依然未分榮辱、而港匯亦仍平定、</p>
<p>法郎票</p>
<p>獨漲二毫半</p>
<p>昨日英純金漲二辦士、英美滙兌升一八七五、外滙洋行結軟甚殷、銀行賣意活躍、市價穩定、無分榮辱、烚赤殷富續有出籠金號錢兌業微有收納、全日交易未盛、市價盤旋帶軟、外幣英美金鎊交易轉稀、英美金票稍供給盛、市價軟弱、匯票穩定、多數呆滯未動、公會交易稀少、永泰出鴻昌進英金鎊十個、仁泰出福和祥進法郎票一百個、三泰出惠通進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金票降一角、美金票降一分八厘、香港票降二厘、法郎票升二毫半、德金票降五分、澳金票降四角、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<p>大條復向下游</p>
<p>三月一日倫敦電、價高時會有一部份補空、但不久即見步降、收槃後市況平定、有少數照掛牌價買進、大條銀近期回縮一二五、遠期亦回降〇六二五、紐的銀電、美銀價依然呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀市況頗平、現貨續跌一安那、近遠期則仍未更動、</p>
<h3>港方及外銀行　相繼猛塞外匯　惟結款仍殷致先鬆後平　匯豐荷蘭電匯長六二五</h3>
<p>滙市昨以外電香港暨英行滙豐相繼猛塞、加其之他外銀行賣意亦濃、故其時雖外行有利復代天津外商銀行與華行等吸購、無如一時仍感供過於求、致潛勢一度鬆硬、計英金會達八辨士一四〇六二五、美滙亦會硬至十五元九〇六二五、然卒以油洋行暨其他洋行突來扒結、並外商電力公司與華商紗花帮亦起購結、致狀況即吿回平、結果則均無榮辱、港滙因供求　均故爲狀始終乏變</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期回縮一二五、遠期亦回降〇六二五、紐的銀價依然未更、倫敦生金升二辨士，滙兌英對美大六毫、對法勿動、對滬小〇六二五、美對英長一八七五、對法漲〇六二五、對滬未更、中央掛牌各滙呆定故如、銀行晨開賣價、英金八辨士一二五、美滙十五元八七五、絞前收均平、開後外電香港與外行匯豐相繼賣予華行及外行有利英金八辨士一四〇六二五、致潛勢略鬆、滙豐掛牌揭曉、荷商電滙、掛長六二五、其餘均未更動、白銀平衡稅揭曉降半分、計徵百分之七·五、此後港電又與外銀行售予華行美滙十五元九〇六二五、故狀態仍鬆、嗣後油洋行及電力公司突來猛扒、德士古暨亞細亞結進匯豐英金八辨士一二五、繼之電力公司購進華比某行美滙十五元八七五、是以潛勢</p>
<h3>證券　進紗出公債　市價並不受甚影響　爲前途希望依然未變</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、經多空雙方激烈競爭後、多方漸佔優勢、市價由疲而趨堅穩、查市價連小數日、爲紗布帮吳某拉抬棉紗加厚實力起見、賣出公債、藉以維持紗價、數日來賣出數且的已三百數十萬元、而樣面並不爲之搖動、按此番出籠之貨、多數爲小金融業陸續吸收、環境漸有曙光、租界問題業已和平解决、第七决甲種中籤紅票以及第六决各統一公債之息票、各銀行已規定九五折貼現、此爲確切之事實、德代辦由重慶赴日、對於中日調解問題、已有相當接近之希望、餘如國際鉅量借款、對於我國已極鞏固之法幣問題、益臻美滿、昨日檯面經過、由疲而堅之情形、觀下列形勢、當有鉅大反動也、昨初開盤時、三十八號首先賣出乙種、先後的二十餘萬、十號跟踪賣出、市價壓小、亦祇二三角、同時三十五號乘低收買、爲數頗鉅、三十八號再轉而掉進內種、爲數亦的二十餘萬、樂茂號及北帮十一號及祥豐號亦有相當吸收，四十六號及協大尚有零數出脫、而散戶需要依然甚殷、將近收盤時、賣戶巳見縮手、戊種由五兀八角回漲至六元一角、收盤檯面、需要仍多、出價二角、竟尚無貨、因此其他各種均見趨堅、結果乙丁兩種回上五分、丙戊兩種完全不動、甲種略小五分、成交總數、共計的七十萬兀左右、茲列簡明裏於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大生第一廠股少數價爲二十三元五角、南市華商電氣股出價五元二角、仍無貨、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外幣債券本月一日（星期三）掛脾行市、僅英德續借款英發債票因屆付息期、降落半鎊、價爲七十三鎊半、（按此項借款係按年四厘半計息、每年三月一日及九月一日各付一期、每期利息、每債票百鎊、應付二鎊五先令、照例市價亦應降落二鎊零、但本日電報僅跌半鎊、若電訊無誤、則行市比上日反升一鎊半、尚祈閱者注意）、其餘均無變動、英倫實貨供售、亦祗鐵路公債梢有點綴、湖廣鐵路公債非德發有印債票、賣出五千鎊、售價二十一鎊、平行市、又津浦鐵路續發公債德發有印債票賣出三千鎊、售價十五鎊十五先令、照市撳落五先令、市氣呆滯、腳地亦見軟弱云、</p>
<p>倫教英商遠東各公司股蔡本月一日（星期三）掛牌行市、開平煤礦不記名股上升一便士半、價爲十七先令四便士半、古拉客林傍橡皮股上升七便士半、價爲二十先令、餘者無變動、</p>
<h3>絲茶　用戶絲討價　已逼近二千元關　橫濱絲市仍未開拍</h3>
<p>國外絲市、橫濱因飛漲過熾、前晚已由該方當局飭令停拍、惟今决絲市在漲、一方固因需求緊張所促成、但就側面觀之、近兩月來日本各物騰漲、未始非經濟枯竭、人心不安、深恐一旦實施通貨膨脹（實質上巳早開始膨脹、）而造成此囤購貨物之心理也、昨紐的里昂絲市續向高峯邁進、日絲八三分又漲八分、七五分日絲漲九分、上海絲漲五分、廣東絲漲七分、里昂日絲漲一·五〇法郎、上海絲漲三法郎、B字漲四·五〇法郎、廣東絲漲四法郎、紐的交易所近期漲七分、遠期漲三分、且市場交易極旺、昨做開一九八〇担、亦爲數年來僅見之氣象、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、漲風固熾、但紊亂亦甚、買賣雙方、均心神恍惚偶而做開交易、亦必毫無準繩且上下午之同級絲交、價格竟相差五六十元、故穩健份子、咸暫停進出、白廠B字絲價、巳售開一九四〇元、二千元絲價前視爲夢想、而今已在咫尺、至於生絲交易、咋起印莊已由堅轉淸、英美絲銷、早吿停頓、用戶絲市做開五六十担、聞討價已逼近二千元、</p>
<p>昨日有湖絲一百六十二件、絲頭八十六件、運歐洲、</p>
<p>又有茶葉五百六十二箱亦運歐洲、</p>
<p>糧食　廠盤减低後　麵粉本街銷路突增</p>
<p>粉市續吿平軟、因南北兩帮客銷均屬零星點綴、已乏大宗交易司談，且聞廠定洋麥、已有兩船、不日可到、購方吃響更覺重視、而廠方尚不願冉事鬆盤、故成交額已不足三萬包、悉由南北兩帮零星辦法、本街交易、則以廠盤減低五分後、進胃較增、的開近萬包、又聞廠方對於客盤、有續低五分之說、市面不易看高、出口昨有粉三千八百包運天津、五百包運烟台、一萬六千八百包杳港來轉燜台、</p>
<p>麥市殊無特色、來源依然廖落存底稀薄、貨方售意堅昂、但聞廠定洋麥已接該輸電報、今後即可進口、對於本麥前途、不無影響、廠方進胃淡薄、統市僅開滁州小麥三百包、價六元八角、由福新廠辦去、市面尚在醞釀中、</p>
<p>激漲半元之巨　糯米開出　十六元七角</p>
<p>糯米自一路飛漲後、至昨漲勢更烈、蓋因客歲登新以後、陰元時感斷絕、變元到貨亦屬有限、而銷路之廣、較往常激增、致常成供不應求之勢、昨竟開出十六元七角、又激漲半元之巨、至於厚薄粳、到源仍屬不夥、河下祗到三號、輪拖來者五六百包、車運抵埠三千餘包、而大囤戶納意仍濃、本街店胃亦續興奮、故形勢依然緊俏、市面繼升一角至角半、杜洋尖埠尖跟上幾分至角許、</p>
<p>客仙有汕厦問津</p>
<p>昨客秈有汕廈帮問津、市面繼續向上、惟市上高貨缺乏、貨主均居奇不肯輕脫、故高蕪秈巳昂至十一元七角半、大市貨亦漲至十一元三四角、南京高秈則議價未妥、未有成交、統市開出三千多包、價比前日叉見步漲四五分至一角許不等、</p>
<p>雜糧　連荳貨缺　市價緊俏</p>
<p>黃豆市在產價報勗、及油餅挺拔之下、一再上升、大連豆現貨吿乏、日商拋售期豆仍殷、計開四月份交四平街豆八車、價爲八元零七分零八分、回籠貨訂十天交一車、價爲八元一角、其他崇明沙黃成交五百餘包、由廈門帮本街分去、杜豆共開二百餘包、行情益見緊張云、</p>
<p>多頭失望　麩皮市氣衰頹</p>
<p>昨日麩皮市氣、轉見鬆動之態、蓋因靑島市情慘跌六角、多方已呈失勢、人心稍舒、但廠鬥依然緊閉、致對內銷場仍無交易可做、昨祇回籠出福新小包五百包、價爲四元三角七分、及阜豐小包六百包、價爲四元三角半、刻下市勢前途、尚多變幻、出於拋出之期貨、須在十四五萬包之上云、</p>
<p>南北貨　紅芡步漲不已</p>
<p>紅芡寶、去冬最小價、會到二十五六元後、回至二十七八元、及至今春、一再躍升、初爲三十一元、旋開三十三元、昨叉開出數十包、貨品較佳、價爲三十五元、比最低價已步升近十元之多、現在香港汕頭等帮均有去胃、查市存不厚、嗣後續緊、亦屬可能、</p>
<p>糖市　國糖開出無多</p>
<p>國糖成交依然零星、昨潮帮開出名成莊正綿赤七十二包、身色俱佳、價爲十六元、較前小二角、黃崗靑數十包、十五元五角、上冰白冰花白績有開出、價乏上落、雜路次白二十包、十八元八角、濟南輸因途次躭擱、須今日可到、汕頭來糖有二千零七十包、</p>
<h3>紗花　現紗變成帽子交易　市盤上落非常迅速　大有兎起鶻落之象</h3>
<p>上日昂腦之紗市、昨則又形回挫，大有兔起鶻落之象、實需雖較減、然南北兩帮採辦尚稱不弱、如天津帮對於十支粗紗納胃既宏大、且在市搜羅、接踵而來、故粗紗市價、非但不落、反見緊俏、蓋此貨日廠早已不紡、而　廠存底薄弱、且囤戶手中都係二十支紗、對於十支紗絕無收囤之念、因之生意一起、市價獨挺、雲南進意稍懈、然大致購買尙不惡、惟市塲上同業互做輪贏交易、異常擁擠、庸集於市上、見緊則來拖進、見鬆忽而放出、形同交易所標紗、出入相仿、故二十支變馬天女等於代表標準模樣、起伏甚巨也、近來在市作搶帽子交易繁劇、上下更形迅速、成交增盛矣、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因上日客帮躉批採辦之後、暫停觀望、一般說者謂實需停頓矣、市象又呈呆定不前之狀、散戶求售之念頓起、開價即小七角半、二十支隻馬紗爲四百零二元、繼以買者寥寥無幾、虛風猝生、逐步下降、敲破四百元關口、最低價爲三百九十七元、棧單做到三百九十四元半、價格一低、引起買戶叉來拖進、重復回升、至收盤做到四百零一元、午後又疲、跌至三百九十九元、迨至收盤回昂至四百元、結果各帮買去統計二千八百三十包、行情二十支雙馬比上日跌二元七角半、天女跌二元半、雙地球跌一元、特余城平、惟十支粗紗因需求旺、反漲二元、大生廠開出十支紅奎星四百五十包、價爲二百八十五元、永安廠開出十支嘉禾三百包、價二百八十一元、新裕廠開出十支地球一百五十包、價二百九十三元、安達廠開出二十支飛虎二百五十包、價三百九十四元、至五元、今日出口有紗三百九十件運天津、二十五件運烟台茲將各帮口買去之額量錄左、</p>

<h3>全國教育會議</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>一看到全國教育會議在重慶開會的消息，使我發生了很大的喜悅。</p>
<p>在這砲火連天烟塵匝地，大家從事抗戰的時期，似乎軍事爲第一，其他都成不急之務了，而現在我們居然有此會議，可見我們的抗戰，原是有通盤的計劃的。各事都能照常進行，預示了我們決可勝利的把握。這是一。</p>
<p>這次會議的出席人員，可以說，集全國的教育行政當局，和著名教育家於一堂，簡直沒有遺漏什麼。這又可見我們中央政府的勢力，和我們的團結精神，非但沒有削弱，反而增加了許多。這是二。</p>
<p>這二端，就是我所以喜悅的原因。</p>
<p>在這會議中，將來要議些什麼，有些什麼議案，現在我們還不能知道。不過我可以斷言，其經過的順利，以及結果的美滿，是一定可以預陪的。因爲當這時期，當這境地，誰還不和衷共濟，虛心討論，而竭智盡能，爲國服務呢！</p>
<p>我不是教育家，所以也沒有什麼特殊的意見，可以供獻給該會議。而且本報「教育消息」中，正登載着各教育家的宏論，而出齋會議的各專家，也必有藎籌碩畫，遠超過我所能想得到的。所以我，也許連一般非教育家在內，就只有靜聆他們的高論，恭候他們的成功。</p>
<p>不過愚者千慮一得，也許有一提的價值吧。我以爲現在所最要緊的，發著眼在「抗戰」方面，已經受到摧殘的教育，當然要好景以復興，照常進行的教育，也當予以革進或者舉而緩不濟急，不切於實用。</p>
<p>報載浙江有「戰時大學」江蘇有「流動學校」，其他爲了適應時代，早已舉辦的特種學校也很多，這都是我所充份贊成的。我希望全國各地的學校，都能本着這個宗旨：促進抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>因此，我請我們「孤島」上的教育家，也就多加考慮考慮吧！</p>
<h3>記曹聚仁先生（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳紫金</p>
<p>一　靑竹布褂</p>
<p>曹先生長年披件靑竹布褂，足登一雙沒油漆的黑皮鞋；有時許是兩雙烏布履。這社會原是講外表的，這個，他可就吃虧了。</p>
<p>在讌會席上，以至於到曁南大學上課，老爺式的嘉賓和公子哥兒式的大學生，都一口咬定他是下走的役廝：茶房。他很幽默地說過：「有時候也很想穿起筆挺的西服，戴架老爺眼鏡。」但他澈頭澈尾地仍舊是那身的靑竹布褂，不分濃春溽夏，肅殺的秋與嚴寒的冬。</p>
<p>這人呌人家敬愛他，在全局中，這「素」字得給他打上一子。</p>
<p>二　治學的「老鼠」</p>
<p>用法國法郎士（Anatole　Frauce）的一句話來說，這人是一頭「圖書舘裏的老鼠」。這不但說他很廣泛地吞噬着書籍，而且說，他的治學像老鼠樣的「精」和「細」。</p>
<p>這人是在舊書堆裏成長起來的，自然，他是化費過不少的精力在「故紙」上頭。但對於這門「國寶」，他並不是個服服貼貼的階下囚；相反地，他是像一位公正和機警的判官似的去處理他的。</p>
<p>世上有種人，眼光好比菜油燈，把一切的古書都捧作聖經，搖頭擺尾地死哼個不休，自己上當不上當也不知道。這人所不齒的便是這種冬烘先生。卡萊爾說過：「讓者下，思者中，觀者上。」治學沒有辨析的眼光可不行，冬烘先生就那麼地只懂得瞎讀，半點兒疑難的精神也沒有，咿咿唔唔了一輩子，整堆整疊的古書却把他壓成個下等的腐儒。「秀才舉人，」他說：「都是不通的寶貝。」這話兒不見得過火罷？</p>
<p>他所不齒的第二種讀書人，就是那「像戈壁的沙漠的吸流水一樣，吸收了知識，却一泓淸泉也不能噴到地面上來的「書櫥」。據說這人早年負笈杭州時，很欽式考據學者單不庵先生，但「支持了十年之久」的信仰，後來終於一古腦兒坍掉了，就爲的這位單先生是隻書櫥。</p>
<p>「我和單不庵師第二次相處於西湖省立圖書舘裏，（民國十六年）這一相處，使我對於他完全失了信仰。他是那樣地淵博，却又那樣地沒有一點兒自己的見解；讀的書很多，從來理不成一個系統。」（文筆散策：我的讀書經騐。）</p>
<p>法國的散文家米賽爾，特·蒙田訕笑這種書櫥好像是個需要火的人到鄰家去取火，但在那裏看見了堆熊熊的火燄，便留下取暖，忘記了帶回家去」「我們拿別人的意見和學問來保存，就算完事了嗎？」他詰問地說：「即使我們腹中充滿了肉，於我們有什麼益處呢？如果我們不能把它消化，如果我們不能把它變成我們的，如果它不能增加我們的發育和力量。」（見論教育）讀書首要的是永遠不要把別人的思想的渣滓鎖緊了自己的腦子，像蒙田那樣博洽，又那樣地有通達的見地，呌人悅服的就在這點。</p>
<p>曹先生也是這一類的讀書人，他在治學上的可敬佩的地方，還是用他修書的話來說吧：（一）時時懷疑古人和古書，（二）有膽量背叛自己的父師，（三）組織自我的思想系統。</p>
<h3>用我們的鐵血爭取自由</h3>
<p>— 戴蒼奇</p>
<h3>「駡人」五說</h3>
<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>「駡人」，似乎是不好的品行。但是一生不駡人的人却是絕對沒有的。而且只要不是吃醉了酒或發瘋，一個人當到敢於駡人的時候，那倒是他有勇氣的時候。倘是駡得對，能駡人的人倒是極有品行的人。</p>
<p>這兒有兩個人：一個人在理直氣壯地駡人；一個人，却逢人彎腰打拱，滿口「佩服佩服。」我們且比較一下，如何？</p>
<p>然而駡人可以刻毒，但決不是誣陷，也可以誇張，但決不是造謠。</p>
<p>刻毒與誇張的駡人，可以成爲文學；誣陷和造謠，却永遠不能成爲文學。</p>
<p>明末底復社同人駡了阮鬍子，阮鬍子底報復手段便是誣陷和造謠。當時阮鬍子是勝利了。但是復社駡阮鬍子的文字倒流傳到現在，而實在也是文學家的阮鬍子，他底誣陷和造謠，現在除了留下一個依然要被人駡的故事而外，却不曾留下一個字。</p>
<p>然而還有一個大忌要把一個本不是丑角的人去勉强書成白鼻子，就是有好本領也是不行的。那結果却往往不能正如尊意。</p>
<p>一位降了淸明朝「遺老」底著作裏面有一首挖苦李自成的詩，那最後的兩句是：</p>
<p>作賊不圖聲色樂，苦心專志致明亡。</p>
<p>作者大槪以爲是俏皮的。但這上一句却恰說明了李自成底好處，而下一句則完全是在說謊。誰也知道「苦心專志致明亡」的是吳三桂一般人，誰也知道李自成是漢人，而且還是被淸朝剿滅了的。這俏皮實際上並不俏。</p>
<p>並不理直氣壯而想駡人，就是用文學的形式寫了出來，也不會成爲好的文學。</p>
<p>然而還有一個大忌。依然是一位降了淸朝的明朝「遺老」底事情：錢謙益被乾隆關進了牢獄，因爲他底同鄉沒有一個人去看望，便把常熟人全體大駡了一通。那也是用文學的形式寫了出來的。但是不行，那樣子只是駡街。</p>
<p>自己做了漢奸，靠新主子底勢力在鄉間作福作威，一旦失寵，却又希望鄉人去問安。想法固然是穩當的，然而却越發暴露了自己的無恥。</p>
<p>要駡人，自己先得不被人駡。要是不然「駡人」倒眞成了沒有品行的舉動了。</p>
<p>眞正駡人的人是不會彎腰打拱的。倘然一面駡人，一面彎腰打拱，不但未免滑稽，而且會闖出亂子，要是一不小心，說「佩服」時說成了「混蛋」，自己就先非吃耳光不可。</p>
<h3>西班牙的宣傳戰</h3>
<p>— 梵珂譯</p>
<p>近代的技術，在已經廣大的戰爭武器以外，又創造了兩種武器。這種最新式的軍火不像坦克車，轟炸機，或手溜彈；他們旣不殺人，也不傷人。那就是空中傳單筒和擴音機。</p>
<p>在今日西班牙任何　一條前綫的背後，相隔不到幾碼，就有一所房子或木屋，墻壁上滿是槍洞，裏面設有一架原始式的印刷樓，不像是由專家裝配起來的，一個兵士俯身在機器上面工作着。他曾受過速成的訓練，曉得怎樣幾十冊幾十山的印出小冊子來。</p>
<p>這些宣傳品的內容很不同；有時是否認敵方參謀部的官塲宣言，對於一輩逃亡到對方陣綫去的士兵允許他們一種近乎天堂的生活，有時則寫有名政治家演詞的拔萃。</p>
<p>在一隻大號的空中傳單筒中，每次可裝進四百小冊子，於是飛運到敵方的戰壕上面散發下去。這傳單筒自空中嘎聲而下，背後拖着一長條白烟到敵綫上空，傳單筒就爆發了，淡色的薄紙就飄到地下，一分鐘後就到了敵方士兵的手中。在有些日子，二十至五十個宣傳筒在分開政府軍和叛軍的『無人地帶』落下。</p>
<p>就戰爭的武器言，無綫電也許更有效果。在前綫上備有各種播音工具，電力由一架舊式馬達供給着。在深夜，戰壕中會突然反響出一支行軍曲或探戈舞曲的調子，或者一支西班牙民謠的思鄉曲的悲調。士兵都渴求任何的娛樂；他們默然地靜聽着。</p>
<p>樂聲突然中止，一個人聲在夜中激響過來。這是敵方的聲音，告訴對方他們已站錯了陣綫，煽動他們叛變，逃亡；促請他們利用黑夜逃到對方去，並允許他們一切美滿的生活。了們用所有想像得到的語言一再反覆申述。</p>
<p>在最近幾個月中，宣傳工作的一品鍋分野大大近代化了。巨大的重載新式宣傳車，不久就將在前綫看到，上面裝有一切最新的機械發明，發音收音均全。裝配有若干分音機，有時擴音機多至十四隻，在受深夜掩護之下，這些車輛開近敵方的前綫，將擴音機裝置在軍略據點後，就開始播音。（車上有鏈和擴音機相聯接）</p>
<p>空中宣傳簡和擴音機，在西班牙戰爭的雙方都很收得成功。敵方的宣傳筒彼此在空中趨過『無人地帶』，接著就是一塲『紙戰』。使失兵士們最應討厭的是雙方同時播音，結果雙方的聲音掛號信相抵銷，兩方播音員的說話都聽不淸楚了。擴音機的聲章能達一哩半路，可是雙方同時播音時的奇怪的交音，簡直使得壕溝中人要發瘋。</p>
<p>這就是宣傳戰爭！不論是口說的，筆寫的一種痛烈的戰爭，不過比之子彈和炸許可戰，却比料受人歡迎些。（譯目再士『國文雜誌』）</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>暫時沉默，大家都低頭思索着，不作声。過了一會，梁團附才開口道：</p>
<p>「要剿除這批土匪本來並不難，不過因此而讓敵人得利，着却未免有些犯不著，所以這事不能用武力解決。我看還是用軟功，好好勸導他們改過自新。」</p>
<p>「我也是這樣想，」葉團長點頭說：「不過就怕他們的野性難馴。聽說他們裏面的人物很是駁雜不純；恐怕要憑人格來感化他們是很困難的。」</p>
<p>「我有一個計料在這里，」朱參謀忽然站起來說：「俗話說得好，『擒賊先擒王』，我們不妨先下一張貼，請獨眼李到這里來赴宴，一面暗暗埋伏好，等他一到，就在席上擲杯爲號，把他逮補起來。他的部下原都是些烏合之眾，『蛇無頭而不行』，到那時改編或解散，便可以聽憑我們自由處置了。」</p>
<p>「這辦法倒也不錯，所慮的就是他不見得肯來上當。」葉團長微笑說。</p>
<p>「不管他來不來，我們不妨先試一試，這呌做『先禮而後兵』，倘若他不來，那時我們再作計較，也還不遲。」梁團附也很贊同朱參謀這辦法，從旁幫襯着說。</p>
<p>大家都同意這主張，於是葉團長便擇定了一個日期，備好一份紅柬，呌勤務兵送到苕溪鎭上去，請徇眼李來赴宴。爲了免得他疑慮起見，連他手下的謀士，綽號狗頭軍師的蕭麻子，也都請了。</p>
<p>下過了請貼以後，葉團長並不以爲就算完了一件事，却仍舊繼續和梁團附朱參謀精密計劃；怎樣佈置埋伏，準備在席上向獨眼李提出怎樣的條件，甚至連計劃如若不辛失敗以後應有何種準備，都早打算好了。（二三）</p>

<h3>在結婚生活中　患有神經衰弱症的痛苦</h3>
<p>結婚生活中的幸福，我們細細研究起來，實是健康的人所特有的權利，假使一有病態發生，那最好就停止進行，要是加以勉强的話，那沒有不感受痛苦的，我們現在就拿一般人所通常有的神經衰弱症來講人所通常有的神經衰弱症來講；神經衰弱一症在外表上驟然看起來，可以一點也看不出什麼異狀來，患此症的人以婚後的男子爲多，而尤以中年人爲最多。所以致病的原因，大都爲早年犯有自凟遺精或婚後的荒淫縱慾之故，此外如憂勞斵傷，病後失調，先天衰弱等原因亦間或有之。因此體內的生殖腺液停滯或枯竭，新陳代謝作用減退，神經系統因得不到適當的營養和調整，即呈衰弱狀態，是以在腦神經方面，即時有頭腦脹痛，健忘失眠，但在此春天困人的季節，復非常疲倦欲睡，當在越是疲倦越是眠不得的時候，其痛苦爲何似！並稍一用腦，即覺眼前金花擾亂，耳中如鳴珮璜，有時竟或昏厥過去！在脊髓神經方面，更時有腰酸背痛，四肢無力，若秒有一操勞，即覺疲備不堪，無法支持矣。至在性神經方面，那凡遺精滑精，見色漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散，久婚不育等症狀更相繼沓來，是以雖在這風和日暖的春天，月白風淸的良宵，夫婦生活如何能洽調而圓滿，然而美眷如花的靑春蹉跎，能無悲感！小之成爲春閨怨婦，家庭中的樂趣毫無，大之惱羞成怒竟與人私通私奔，或明目張胆與夫在法庭相見振振有詞訴請離婚者亦是常有的事！此種丈夫，遭受如此人生的慘境，其內心上的痛苦更將何似！</p>
<p>關於上述症象的特效療法，久已爲世界名醫及余多年經驗，均以爲服用雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，使病癥頓然減輕，苦能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治癒，並使身體益增健康，收延年益壽，返老還童之效。此項藥劑，并經德國名醫（Miller）梅爾斯氏化驗，證明其品質純粹，藥性溫和，補力積極，服後絕無刺激胃腸興奮神經等副作用，所以斷定其爲內分泌或靑春腺製劑中之極品，宜其自發明以來，即風行全球譽滿天下爲各藥房均樂以出售了。惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等科學方法，更可保證治癒。</p>
<h3>乳峯與面貌臀部的健美法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>健康和美麗，我想爲每一個女性所憧憬而追求著的吧！誠然，一個健美多姿的女郎，實是社會中的瑰寶，男人們心中的靈魂，未來偉大時代的母親，她如果一旦和如意郎君結婚，那夫婦間愛情濃厚，生育著伶俐的子女，組織著快樂的家庭，生活是何等的光榮而幸福！可是女性怎樣能獲得健美呢？這是我們所要迫切解決的問題。</p>
<p>時代的輪曝光表在不停留地轉動，對於女性美的觀念，已擯棄了過去虛僞的，嬌弱而病態的美了。現在所著重的是女性特徴發達的健美。這種特徴的主要者爲乳峯，面容和臀部，乳峯與臀部的發達，面容的紅潤而活潑，在醫家的論斷，是根據於卵巢機能健全和新陳代謝作用旺盛之故。假使一個女性而不幸患有月經不調，白帶，不感，不娠以及其他的暗疾之故，卵巢機能爲之摧殘，那乳峯即無良好的發育，即已有良好發育者，亦必逐漸的萎癟下去，臀部亦然，新陳代謝作用因之減退，是以在皮膚，肌肉，血液等部分充滿著廢料物質，而無新細胞產生，是以面容即呈枯黃或慘白狀態，年齡尚輕，而未老先衰，此種女子，在處女時代，必不能選得如意郎君，如已出嫁，夫婦愛情必然淡薄，甚或生育無望，爲丈夫遺棄，感身世飄零，其悲慘爲何似！唯一補救辦法，即服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，以增强卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，則上述各症不特可以根本治愈，并可使乳峯聳起，臀部發達，面容紅潤，肌肉豐腴，血液充盈而鮮紅，誠爲却病延年增進健美的唯一科學良法也</p>
<p>青年通病</p>
<p>— 性病專科醫師　烽詹念曾</p>
<h3>自凟遺精不啻自絕生機</h3>
<p>人生最苦痛的事情：莫如『落花雖有意，流水却無情』了，我們曾經接觸過萬千個靑年病者，覺得他們起始每因一念之錯，昧於生理，不知自身精液之可貴，眈溺自凟，甚至旦旦而伐、及至後來病態百出，惡果已成，而且要實行人生最可貴的幸幅生活時方覺『强弩之末，雖穿魯縞』。一個已到口的鏝頭，只好看了嚥　，沒有咀嚼它捅力，於是急得像熱煱子上螞蟻，哭喪着臉向人殷切求治，然而『臨時抱佛脚』，這時的懊悔，終覺已經遲了！</p>
<p>所以古人有言，曰：『凡事愼之於前，必悔之於後』，我們立身處世，應當用而用，不應當用而不用，這不但對於一事一物爲然，即對於生理上的要求，亦何獨不然，譬如說夫婦生活是人倫之大道，它負有繁衍種族，改進社會，與調劑身心等使命的，我們自然應該做，但也要適可而止，過與不及，亦均有害，自凟，是健康的魔鬼，幸福的劊子手，這種機械式的，違反生理的洩慾舉動，我輩智識靑年，無論如何，不能讓他沾身，因爲這個惡魔一經沾身，繼起的便是遺精，遺精過頻之後，腰痠背痛，健忘失眠，耳鳴心悸，頭暈眼花，陽萎早洩，發育不全，精薄精枯，久婚不育等症，必然接踵而至，於是你的神志消沉了！氣槪頹喪了！身軀瘦削了！終日沒精打采，錦銹的前程，化爲泡影！兩性間的幸福，歸於消滅，多少有爲的人士，都爲了這樣的遭遇，而湮滅不聞，甚至憤慨自殺！</p>
<p>切莫候到悲劇降臨的一天，那時你只有『事到臨頭悔已遲』的份兒的，你現在應即憬然自悟，如犯自凟，應立即提高意志，從事於有益的運動，戒絕自凟，如有遺精滑精等症者，尤應於臨睡前以冷水摩擦局部，並服『希米脫氏固精片』四片，則精關有金湯之固，你的精液，就中會儘向外流了，如因自凟遺精而已釀成上述各種衰弱症象者，則應同時兼以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』爲　袖，此劑藥力宏偉，服後一日夜間卽能生精强腎，健腦益髓，如能繼續服用，持之以恒，那麼雖極虧弱的身體，也不難於短期內恢復健壯，</p>

<p>白濁一症，固人人知其易於傳染，又人人知其難於根治者也。惟世人知其然，而不知處置其所以然，或爲環境所　或爲巨幅廣告性之白濁藥是賴，往往私行服用市上充斥之成藥，而不知淋疾之病，病情折曲微妙，非有誠實之學問，豐富之經騐，運用科學之方法，作精治之事。諸位患者必須注意，決不可以身試藥，亦不可以病試法。蓋淋病旣然曲折微妙，求之市上現成之藥品，實不能適如其分。亦不能乞之一知半解，及設備落伍簡陋醫家，只用粗劣之手術與機械，所可奏功，此事理之昭昭明甚者。</p>
<p>第一：病家必須記到，在急性白濁時，其痛楚乃生理上自然之反應，不然强行壓制，求快一時。一般鎭痛療法，只不過用酥麻之法，麻醉其神經知覺，及減低病家之抵抗力而已。試問此種療法，豈非抱薪救火，援賊以柄乎？故善治白濁者，貴能在急性淋時，作迅速合法之根治，始可不貽他日之梅。否則一過急性即成慢性，時發時愈，併發關節炎，膀胱炎，睪丸炎，攝護腺炎等症。故患者能在急性時，請富有經驗之醫家，受合理之療法，如運用特市２自家菌苗作無痛之注射，及冷却法，德國濾淋平流電療法，方能達到殲除淋菌，增大病家抵抗力，在一二星期內，絕對可以根治，決不致令淋病轉入慢性期，蓋根本解決白濁之要訣，在於「去菌」二字而已。而「去菌」必以其法，固非一般不負責之輩所能做到也。</p>

<h3>療養兼施症非危篤　吐血處理之道</h3>
<p>— 謝也農</p>
<p>人於旣罹疾病之後，除求治於醫藥外，對於起居，飲食，心理，方面，亦須施用適當之療養與節制，則病輕者易愈，重者可减少危險。反之則輕病變重，重者致危；此於一般疾病均如此，於吐血亦然。吐血患者，於服藥之餘，應顧及下列幾點。</p>
<p>心理療養　常人一經吐血，心中卽感極度恐慌，一如生命危險，卽在目前者；並有人誤以吐血為肺癆危症，生機從此全絕者；此種觀念，實為心理上一大錯誤。須知此病，症情有輕重之別，並不盡皆危重。肺癆病過程中，雖有吐血之可能，而吐血並非盡屬肺癆。病者大忌慌張失措，深恐惶慮；心中宜泰然處之，一面堅守醫藥必效靜養必愈之信念。</p>
<p>謹愼舉動　吐血之來，無論出於肺，出於胃，宜安心靜養，禁止劇烈動作，避免多談話，不可氣惱動怒。蓋劇動則震傷血絡，創口不易凝結，談話多則勢必興奮，血脈緊張，創口亦不易平復；怒火衝激，血流橫逆，能使血出增多。</p>
<p>禁忌物品　酒，烟，茶，富有興奮神經之作用，非但在吐血期中，宜乎戒絕，卽吐血初愈，血管凝結，尙未堅固，服飲此類刺激物品，易使其病復發。此外如辣茄，生薑，紅棗，胡椒，等辛熱食物，均應禁止。</p>
<p>食物療法　藕性甘寒，能涼血止吐衂，大吐血時，用生藕榨汁，頻頻飲之，大有功效。曾患血症者，平時宜多食之。煮熟之藕湯，能和血安神益胃。姑蘇熟藕，兼有養肺之功。是以此物乃吐血之療養妙品。白芨粉，參三七，墨汁亦治吐血，以其含膠汁頗多，能膠粘血管破裂之處，使之凝合，醫藥上恒採用之。</p>
<h3>山楂糖漿</h3>
<p>— 陳家楨</p>
<p>常人飲食不愼，或食後偶受風邪，易致積食，使消化機能失常，從而引起腹痛，發熱，瀉痢等症。此時宜用消食法，最簡單而有效者，當推山楂糖湯，且入口生津，如飲咖啡茶；治小兒食積，尤最相宜，蓋小兒多懼服藥，投以此湯，必皆喜飲。茲將其製法詳述於下：先向藥店中購焦出楂末四兩，就釜中炒熱，加紅糖四兩，置鍋中煎熬，待糖溶解後，再煎五分鐘盛起。置諸碗中，如糖漿狀，用時滾水冲二匙，山楂味酸而甘，能助長胃酸，促進消化，非他藥所及。飯後如能常飲此湯少許，可免各種腸胃病。且其味甘美可口，如飲咖啡然。</p>
<h3>過胖過瘦</h3>
<p>— 陳佐雷</p>
<p>胖與瘦，原非病也；但若痴肥過甚，或骨瘦如柴，則已越乎常態，浸將成病，此時必須設法减肥或使瘦者增加重量。然用藥物療治，亦非所宜，茲將介紹最簡易之食療法兩種如下：</p>
<p>治胖　進膳時，常以昆布煮湯佐飲，久即能减肥治胖；考敦煌石室古本草，亦載有「昆布下氣，久服瘦人。」之語。目昆布功能减低血壓，故肥人宜之。</p>
<p>醫瘦　用牛髓和以地黃汁，白蜜並黑芝蔴等搗成粉狀，煎成液膏，日作點心服之，雖口味不甚佳美，但能使瘦者漸肥，且有潤補五臟之功也。</p>
<h3>痔瘡之患</h3>
<p>— 許錦濤</p>
<p>據一般醫家之統計，患痔瘡病者，苟非久居卑濕之地，卽因終日端坐，缺少運動；或操勞過度，或濕熱素重，或平素酷嗜杯中物，不知節制，損及內臟，遂罹此疾。</p>
<p>痔疾旣成，行便不爽，失却常規，且精神萎頓，工作乏力，甚至劇痛難忍，臥床不起。治療之法，凡大便作痛者，宜潤燥除濕；肛門墜痛者，瀉火淸濕，小便澁滯者，淸肝導濕；其已成漏者，則以養元氣，補陰培精為主。同時飲食方面，尤宜格外注意，第一須戒絕烟酒，此外，如：辣椒，大蒜，蒜苗，胡葱，生姜，澎蟹，甲魚，蚶子，魚蝦，瓜菓，咖啡，高粱酒及共他刺激性之食品，均切不可再進，否則疾勞延變，痛苦日深，耗財傷身，後患不堪設想。</p>
<h3>雞蛋與豆腐漿</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>雞蛋之營養力最充足，豆乳則富於脂肪素，能使胃腸滋潤。如每日淸晨，將淡豆腐漿一盞，冲入生雞子一個，攪勻作點心服，功效之大，比任何補品為優。據一曾患肺病之友人言，彼年約十六七歲時，罹慢性肺癆症，吐血，咳嗽，發熱，盜汗，失音，危象環生，醫治罔效，後得此法，初服一月，平平，二月後咳嗽已無；三月，音亦揚；繼續半年，諸恙若失，一年後，轉為一強壯之靑年矣。後仍繼續服食。至今五十餘歲，吐血嗽咳等症，從不復發。</p>
<h3>食養識小錄</h3>
<p>金橘嫓美橘子</p>
<p>果類之中，常人每喜橘子，以具汁多而味甘也。但又有金橋一種，俗名金柑，又名金蛋，功能解醒消食，化痰止渴，雖其肉味稍酸，然食之有益無損也。</p>
<p>— （張純）</p>
<p>玉蜀黍莖代藥</p>
<p>取玉蜀黍數枚，刮去顆粒，只留其莖，置瓦上焙成炭，另用茶葉若干焙焦，共煮，取其湯以飲患傷風兼有頭痛症者，其效頗佳。此湯在一日內可多飲幾次，飲後尤宜避風安臥，始克奏功。</p>
<p>— （韋思琪）</p>
<p>生肝汁自製法</p>
<p>以新鮮牛肝或猪肝五六兩，用滾水反覆洗凈，切爛和以適當之溫開水，再用紗布絞濾，取其汁一飲而盡，（如覺腥氣難食，可酌加檸檬汁或橘子汁少許）對於神經衰弱及惡性貧血等症，均有特效。</p>
<p>— （沈裁之）</p>
<p>猪腦髓治頭暈</p>
<p>凡非外感風寒，而係虛火上炎引起之頭暈，可用猪腦髓兩三副，加入葱薑料酒食鹽醬油等物，淸蒸或油煎食之，數次以後，其病當已。</p>
<p>— （張仲顯）</p>
<p>治遺精之妙品</p>
<p>取薏仁米四錢，湘蓮芡實各一兩，淮山藥亦一兩，酸棗仁二錢，茯神（炒）四錢，加淸水若干，納磁罐內置炭火上，文火燉之，每日加白糖少許食之，可治遺精，有奇騐。</p>
<p>— （李純益）</p>
<p>百合補力一般</p>
<p>百合能安神潤肺，多食益氣力，淸神明。日食一碗，其滋補力甚大，惟其味略苦，煮時須加白糖少許，病後調養，食此最佳。</p>
<p>— （張璐）</p>
<p>蚶子柔肝補血</p>
<p>魁蛤，俗名蚶子。其食法大多均用開水泡熟，再用薑醬麻油拌食之。古本草中所載：此物功能柔肝，養肝，補血，健胃。味極鮮美，實為食養之無上妙品。又其壳入藥，名瓦楞子。古書載：能治積年胃脘，血塊，瘀血疼痛，此種症狀非卽今胃癌胃潰瘍之症乎？李時珍謂此物鹹，走血，而軟堅，故對於胃癌胃潰瘍皆有奇效。前數期張君曾經提及，意有未盡，補識數言。</p>

<h3>糯米粉</h3>
<p>— 張懷霖</p>
<p>糯米粉做的圓子，實了餡，有桂花豆沙，有冬笋肉糜，香噴噴，甜咪咪，非常可口，嗜之者甚衆，但老年人或兒童食之，很不易消化，往往因而停滯，發生消化不良症，如胃呆，便秘，發熱，或痢疾等。新年之後，此種現象極多。</p>
<p>糯米圓子的阻碍消化，原因就在糯米粉上，因為糯米的性質很粘凝結實，磨了粉，再加水一搓，便更黏稠了，而且還能發酵，消化力不強的人，很容易停滯，停滯之後，糯米粉在胃中發酵，胃酸溢出，就會發出一種奇突的臭味。</p>
<p>治療因糯米粉而發生的消化不良症，藥舖裹有一種「飯灰」，用飯炒焦了的炭，開水吞服二三錢，它的功用能防止發酵和吸收水分，所以很是靈騐的。</p>
<h3>一種廉價治療劑　生薑止嘔如神</h3>
<p>— 吳善慶</p>
<p>嘔吐之證，有寒有熱，其屬於熱性者，固待苦寒藥品，藉以通降其逆；然非佐以味辛氣溫之生薑，藥力不易受納。其屬於寒性者，多由脾胃虛餒，寒從中起，以致嘔逆頻作，食飲不下，尤宜餌以生薑，必能通陽泄濁，辟寒逐穢，往往如鼓應桴。</p>
<p>生薑含有揮發性，功能刺激胃神經，而使胃之分泌增多，加進蠕動，又能刺激小腸，並使腸之乳糜管吸收力增強，故為止嘔健胃之良品。</p>
<p>薑汁之能治嘔吐，旣如上述。其用法可將生姜搗取自然汁兩匙，和以溫開水半小杯，頻頻呷飲少許，凡患嘔吐拒納者，莫不隨飲而隨止。</p>
<h3>危症食療</h3>
<p>— 陸成一</p>
<p>食物療病，通常有一槪念，以為泰半祇適用於痔疥小疾，若病入膏盲，藥力尙不能治，尋常食品，何所用哉！其實病至危殆時，胃必困憊，凡藥多能傷胃敗胃，故病甚者嘔藥不受，病至危急，藥復何用？此時惟就胃之所悅而合宜於病者，緩緩調之，病自轉機，蓋藥物食物俱先入胃，而後再起一切作用也。</p>
<h3>橘子</h3>
<p>— 孫宗魯</p>
<p>橘子，果類中勝品也。吾國以福建漳州產之蜜橘為最佳，甘甜如蜜，齒頰留芳。試以美國花旗橘與蜜橘互食比較，一則味酸帶苦，一則味甘如飴，優劣判然。橘子中含營養素最富，實為人身上營養必需之品，飯後將橘剝開食之，旣能補身，又助消化，誠天然妙品也。又患傷寒及熱性傳染病，日以數枚製汁，能退熱消火。又為治壞血病之專藥，一經食之，病即可减，功效非任何藥物所及。</p>
<p>友人某君身體孱弱，齒齦腫脹，時時出血，後每日飲橘子汁若干，不數日，牙齦腫脹即退，出血亦止。蓋是病乃營養素缺少所致，橘子中含此最豐，故某君飲橘汁後，病即全除，　不是為奇也。</p>
<h3>烏骨雞</h3>
<p>— 蔣鑑初</p>
<p>雞之為物，能補兀益氣，滋陰養腎，故恒視為寶貴之家常食品。不知雞羣之中，尤以烏雞為更可貴。</p>
<p>按烏雞，即烏骨雞，辨識極易，其足皮呈黑色或靑灰，雞冠常為紫色，其毛多白色，黑者則尤佳。味甘性溫，能補陰虛，治消渴，用於女子則能調經種子，止帶通經：即市上亦有以烏雞製為白鳳丸者是也。用於成人小兒，則能治痢補元。其肫肝黃皮，可治靑年洩精，早泄，及小兒遺溺，腸風諸症，有意想不到之效。常食可養氣補血，調治各症。惟選購時應取雄者為佳，其骨越烏越好。</p>
<h3>治腫妙品</h3>
<p>— 張仲僊</p>
<p>水腫原因甚多，撮其要，不外病在脾腎二臟，但水腫如不見臍突，背平，缺盆平，足心平，唇皮腫黑，或腎囊及莖不腫腐，均尙可治。其治法除藥物外，以冬瓜及黑魚為最效。冬瓜洗淨後，連皮切片，加寗子淡菜煨湯。無冬瓜，即用黑魚，（一名烏魚一名七星魚）去鱗及肚內雜物，洗淨後，加大蒜頭煨湯。考寗子淡菜，滋陰補腎，腎氣旣充，脾亦健運，水乃流行。冬瓜利水，引之下行，久服自見功效。黑魚扶脾利水。大蒜頭，健脾胃，治腎氣，開竅利水，二者合用，脾腎並治。但均不可加油鹽，加油鹽即失其利小溲作用，效騐毫無矣。</p>

<h3>錢</h3>
<p>— 人甬</p>
<p>聖經上說：『愛錢是人世間一切罪惡底根源。』這句話雖着重在貪得無厭的「愛」字上，但字裏行間也表示出「錢」之可鄙。罪惡底根源，「錢」似乎多少也得負些責任。</p>
<p>輕視錢財，本來是自鳴淸高的文人雅士底通性，中外古今無不如此。我國古人就有以講『錢』為恥，稱錢為『阿堵物』，以為再淸高沒有了。</p>
<p>其實呢？『錢』有何罪，被人如此鄙視。老實說，這世界誰能脫離它，卽使是將來，憑你信用制度怎樣發達與健全，錢還得抽象地存在。我們又何必以鄙視錢財為淸高。現在是功利主義的世界；權利義務，須要判個分明，鄭板橋曾在他底書畫潤例後面說得好：『凡送禮物食物，總不如白錢為妙；公之所送未必弟之所好也。送現銀則中心喜樂，書畫皆佳。禮物旣屬糾紛，賒欠尤為賴帳，年老神倦，亦不陪諸君子作無益語言也。』這種直截痛快坦白的口吻，也便是板橋勝人處吧？</p>
<p>所以錢是不該被鄙視的，也不需耍被鄙視，理由是「錢底本身無罪」，它是取决於人的。</p>
<p>漢奸歛財，供給兒孫姨太太揮霍，錢確乎太卑鄙，可是我們也曾看到人家扳下金牙齒獻給政府；積下一天的擦鞋錢，用來捐助政府，報上無數無名氏先生在慷慨救濟難胞，則錢似乎又是値得歌頌了。同是一張中央銀行鈔票，或香或臭，變化無窮。但我們得認淸，它是被動的，關鍵完全在人的身上。</p>
<p>所以我要為錢呌屈，人們不該自己擺佈了金錢，還把罪惡推在它身上。今後我們對於錢底觀念要轉變過來：錢本身原是淸白的，但是人們把它染上了各樣的顏色，加上了香料臭汁。我們用不着駡錢為阿堵物，相反地，我們應管束自己，不使自已從無恥中撈錢，不准自己在無謂中化錢。我們要憑良心流血汗去換錢，同時又要把它支配在有價値的用度上。於是，錢也便變得無上的高貴，値得被人頌讚了。</p>
<h3>談「朋友節」</h3>
<p>— 雪良</p>
<p>諺語云：「四海之內，皆兄弟也。」又云：「在家靠父母，出門靠朋友。」可見友朋對吾們人類的確是需要的了。因為這個緣故，有黃警頑君］發起指定每一年的三月三日為中國的朋友節，以聯合各個人，在人格平等的目的上，多做益世的事業，力謀人類的幸福。光陰過得眞快，自從發起至今，已是第六個朋友節了；與婦女節，見童節等同樣照例，朋友節也使人最可慶祝，紀念的，何况又到了風和日暖的春天，和藹可親的時候呢。</p>
<p>由於事實的證明，朋友節的確是値得提倡，並且擴展的；而尤其在目前國難萬分嚴重的時侯，需要推行開來，務使每一個陌生的，不生感情的人，都能够變得親熱，由此，再堅强地團結起來，造成一個鞏固的集體，對現在正在進行着的抗戰，是不無些微的幫助與裨益的。</p>
<p>殘酷的侵略者們，將吾們無數的優良的田地蹂躪了；將吾們無數的親愛，和善的同胞殺害了；逢到了這個朋友節，想起了此情此景，吾們的心中，難免要發生一陣悲感。他們也是「人」，吾們也是「人」，為什麼他們要遭遇到如許的苦困呢？為什麼吾們又只能在孤島之上偸安享樂呢？朋友節的立意，就是耍呌吾們，多少總該負起一些本位的責任來，不要專門唱唱高調，喊喊口號，就算完事；吾們雖然不能肩起槍桿，趕赴前綫去痛快地禦殺敵人，但是終久也得做些慈善事業，推行節約救難，儘量服用國貨……這也何嘗不是一種愛國，救國的辦法</p>
<p>有錢的朋友，要知道你四周圍那般窮苦的，不幸的朋友的境况，而儘量予以幫助，無論是物質的，或者是精神的，一切都是需要。身處苦境的窮朋友，也不必失望頑廢，喪心嘆氣，抱定了消極的態度；要知凡事只在人為，只要吾們大家振作起精神來，互相勉勵，努力，奮鬥，沒有什麼事情，不會成功的！</p>
<p>過去的朋友節，對這一點上，似乎還尙未做得滿意；可是，從今年的朋友節起，吾相信，一定會有很大的成績出來的。各位朋友，包括一切老的，小的，男的，女的，富的，窮的，有知識的，不識字的，一律都歡折起來吧，一律都團結起來吧，在人格平等，節約救難，愛國救國的大目的下，大家都準備起新的努力，新的力量，以創造未來的中國的光榮的歷史吧。</p>
<p>在今年的朋友節，吾門不能也不忍狂歡慶祝，但望在明年的朋友節來臨的時侯，吾們大家，每一位同胞，也就是每一位朋友都能够儘量地慶祝，紀念一下了。</p>
<h3>續談香烟畫片</h3>
<p>— 李効鏞</p>
<p>及至我國南洋，華成等烟公司興起，各洋商姻公司之市塲多被取而代之，挽回利權頗多。南洋華成所出皆山水，繡像人物（卽三國封神等），哈德門專出戲劇，華成專出時裝美人，其餘各烟商所出之片，皆粗製濫造，且多屬低級趣味，這一時期，多數畫片，皆毫無價値</p>
<p>以後紅錫包香烟出一種歷代名女子（如楊貴妃，曹大家，紅燕等）反面並有略傳。相繼而起者，有華成金鼠牌之紅樓人物，金邊，反面有詩評。之後又出京戲百醜圖卡通等。南洋大聯珠內有新裝束，說部有水滸，三國誌，七俠十三俠，以及歷代名將傳略等（反面有極簡明之傳略）。紫金山牌出有三國人物，金邊，反面並有詩評。司太非牌出有紅邊七劍十三俠等。這一時期中各烟商所出之畫片，多取材於說部，而彩色片反面有說明之南洋水滸，畫工精美之極，每一批新片問世，集者爭向片商購之，不惜重價，先得為快，惜出至四十餘回後，約共三百餘張，繪者易人，印工亦差。最合於敎育大衆，發揚國光，激發民氣的，常推南洋所出歷代名將。總之，這一時期，南洋公司所出之畫片，居於領導之地位。</p>
<p>迨至一二八後，我國烟廠增多，畫片亦各色皆備。福新公司金字塔香烟，出一種淞滬戰事寫實片，最受各界歡迎，這可見我國當時羣衆心理之一斑。</p>
<p>最近有人主張用香烟盡片來普及民間敎育，這的確是一件値得注意的事，國外烟草公司很多的出一種寶用小工藝畫片，來敎育人民生產，用意至善。又有許多公司，出一種專門介紹新興學說的畫片，可見現在國外人士對於香烟畫片的重視，値茲我國長期抗戰時期，各烟商應如何利用畫片來幫助國家宣傳正義，庶幾視國外烟商而無愧，現在在上海雖不能將前綫將士英勇抗戰的姿態　於畫片上，至少也要做到敎育民衆的程度。（完）</p>
<h3>柔腸九廻</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“The　Young　in　Heart”</p>
<p>看完了「柔腸九廻」，覺得這個故事是太傷感了！一個有一位老朋友留給她許多錢，還有一所在倫敦的住宅，而能到處遊歷，排遺她的晚年歲月的愛蓮福瓊，她是如何憧憬着靑春的活潑呢，這種蓄孕在她的心底的悲哀，在一個偶然的機會裏，她遇見了安東尼的全家。禮査和卓治安妮的靑春活潑在她面前出現的時候，慘痛的回憶使她莫來由地和安東尼全家發生了好感，她是想在這些年靑人的身上找回狄克（她的老朋友）和她自己的影子，The　Youngin　Heart就展開了這樣傷感的一個故事。</p>
<p>大槪由於劇本內容的决定，導演者對於這個故事的處理，是採取異常遲緩的調子的；而且全片自始至終在描寫安東尼全家瑣碎的日常生活，那樣有條不紊地，像一隻帆船航行在風平浪靜的海面上一樣，平穩地到達了目的地。這種素描式的作風，果然有它特殊的成就，但是使銀幕下的觀衆也沉浸在痛苦的回憶中，那末「柔腸九廻」所含蓄着的鼓勵靑春活潑的朝氣，恐怕也將得到相反的效果：至少在我個人是這樣想。</p>
<p>導演者這樣寗靜，幽默的作風，自然有他藝術的成就。譬如：他開塲介紹安東尼全家四個人物，就那樣明顯地刻劃了劇作者所理想中的四個輸廓，而一直到終塲，他始終緊緊地抓住他們的性格。更其是在一枝一節的地方，他是非常幽默地，諷刺地使他們活躍在銀幕上。譬如：安東尼全家被逐之後，他們蜷伏在街頭，安東尼先生和太太的歌唱，禮査和卓治的躺在淸道夫小車上，到倫敦以後，父子兩人的看着起重機，安東尼的任推銷汽車掮客：禮査的酒醉等等，都充份地給這四個人物顯示了活活的形象。</p>
<p>演員方面：羅倫楊的父親，琵琶褒克的母親，小范朋克的哥哥，珍妮蓋諾的妹妹，及曼麗杜莉的愛蓮福瓊，都各別的發揮了他們的演技。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖</p>
<p>現在楞伽山上，却造了一座很好的中國式房子，那座房子，喚作石湖書院。這書院的名稱，在中國由來已古，宋朝的時候，就有書院了。書院也和現今的大學校中學校一樣，也有士子肄業其中。主持書院的人，從前稱之為山長，由地方上聘淸了當地的通儒做的。蘇州本來也有好幾個書院，每月出題老試，文字優美的也獎給膏火之資。自從學校興了，那書院便廢了，但是現在為什麼又有一個石湖書院呢？這不是復古開倒車了嗎？不是的！要說書院的名詞古，那末學校的名詞更古。其實這個書院中，與從前有些兩樣的，不是士子肄業之所，而是一班耆碩宿學的研究　述之處。這裹頭有經學家，史學家，考據家，詞曲家，以及詩家，畫家，總之中國固有的舊學。都萃築其中。雖然在裹面的不限定蘇州人，而蘇州却居其多數。因為吳中盛文史，向來從　朝以來就稱道的，而蘇州一向是優閑的人居多數，俗語呌做「寫意朋友」，寫意朋友，倒是研究這種學問最擅長呢。不要小覷那個石湖書院咧，每一年由石湖書院裹出版的著作，至少有五六十種呀！這些書，由上海一家書館裹，訂有特約，歸他們那裹出版。著書人收有版稅，但是這項版稅，為書院中所公有。因為那些老先生，由書院裹月致薪金若下，很為優待，而他們也大都是五六十歲以上的人，澹　寗靜，他們並不要貪得什麽額外利潤，又用不着他們贍　家室，所以情願把版稅歸諸公有。這一筆版稅，起初出書出得少，每年　收入不多。後來出書出得多了，這一筆版稅，着實可觀。他們公議在這項版稅內提出一筆款子來搜集古代版畫，獎勵木刻等費，就是每年萬元。其他石湖書院，經費，却是另有的款，無煩他求的。從前一個牛鬼蛇神，女巫們迷信崇奉的淫祠所在，此刻變了那班龐眉皓髮的老先生們，研究開發，著書立說的地方，眞是天差地遠了。這個石湖書院裏，只有吳素君來過，她說：她有一位叔　，也是考據家，住在書院裹，她曾去拜訪過他好幾次咧。（五〇）</p>

<h3>談崑劇中之笑（下）</h3>

<h3>關於瑙瑪希拉　眞是優越前進的明星堪作中國女星的楷模</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉Norma　Shearer無疑地是當今好萊塢影城中最偉大，最成功的女明星了。她在『天長地久』『鑄情』『絕代艷后』中的卓絕的演技，試問那一個人見了，不要羨慕她，稱許她讚美她的？近幾天路透社的好萊塢電說她病重，每一個關心女士的影迷，心中不免總有些惴惴不安吧。現在，且讓吾將女士一生奮鬥的歷史寫在下面，獻於諸位讀者。</p>
<p>嚴肅的生活</p>
<p>瑙瑪女士於一九〇四年八月十日誕生於加拿大之瑪地利亞城，到目前，差不多已有上三十五歲的光景了。她並沒有像普通的一般女明星們的習俗，並不整日整夜地鬧着戀愛：她的生活，永遠是嚴肅的，優秀的，靜穆的。她是一個賢妻，一個良母，並且還是一個優越的伶人：她所以會得到今日的成功，也正是為了有這種安靜而淸穆生活的緣故。</p>
<p>戲劇的思想</p>
<p>早在童年的時代，瑙瑪女士就已歡喜舞臺上的玩意兒啦，她開始希望日後變成一個大明星，而且夢想着將來終有一天使她得到偉大的成功。到了十六七歲時，她的思想，就集中在戲劇的新聞上，只要一看見那一家戲館在做戲了，她準會在百忙之中，抽出一個閑空的辰光來，趕去看個暢快的。這個時候，她所最高興閱讀的東西，就是好的副本，劇評之類的書籍。</p>
<p>黃金的時代</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉也相信一個女防孩子，必須要有美麗的面貌，好的表演天才，與充分的學問，才可以算得上出人頭地：因此，她對她的營業，也很注意。後來的成名，大一半或許也靠着這一個信念。曼麗璧克馥Mary　Pickfird在十五歲時便開始顯身銀幕—十五六歲的時期，正是每一個女性最美麗的黃金時期呵｜瑙瑪希拉也想在這個時期內，成功像曼麗樣的事業，受大衆的歡迎與愛戴。</p>
<p>堅决的奮鬥</p>
<p>這些希望，這些夢想，終使她離開那靜寂的，樸實的瑪地利亞城，而來到了豪華的，繁盛的紐約這大都市中；想在這個時代的大都會中，實踐她的理想。可是，這時候，她好像還尙未與『幸運兒』相見，她只在一家公共圖書館中做事，隨身帶來的旅費也差不多要用完了，親愛的母親，又離開她回去了………。但是，她有的就是一個堅决的意志而巳。果眞，後來經過了好多轉折，磨難，終使她有機會進入了攝影塲，跨進了一向在夢想着的電影界的門口。自此之後，她自己又肯努力，不斷地奮鬥着，她底成功已在廣泛的觀衆層中，建立起穩固的基礎來了。</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉的確是一位偉大的紅星，只要看她過去的奮鬥的歷史，與現在站着的崇高的位置，吾們就不難知道了。末後，讓吾們希望她的喉症能够早日痊愈，不要呌病魔纏住她吧。</p>
<h3>申曲必須改良</h3>
<p>— 邵懷宗</p>
<p>申曲擁有廣大的聽衆，因為它唱詞通俗，能合社會上一般大衆的心理。倘你在馬路上徘徊，那店家無綫電裹所播送出淸朗悅耳的申曲唱詞，足以使你留戀忘返：在遊藝塲裹的申曲塲上，總是人山人海，座無隙地。申曲之為大衆所歡迎可以概見。</p>
<p>申曲旣如此的為大衆所歡迎，那末申曲家們應如何知所自勉，努力改進，才不辜負社會羣衆的期望，以盡其非常時期國民一份子的職責。但使人感到萬分痛惜的，是它的劇本的不良，日常所聽到的總是些男女私訂終身，調情戲謔，以及吊膀子，軋姘頭等卑鄙的腐調，褒揚忠烈，以及含有國防意味的劇本的演唱，幾如鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>演唱卑鄙粗俗的戲曲，其影響於社會風氣的敗壞，實非淺尠。在不知不覺之間，大衆的精神，日就衰落：誰還想到祖國目前在千鈞一髮的時機中，誰還想到國民一份子的責任的重大？無疑地，這會直接毒害了大衆，間接阻碍了長期抗戰的國策。賢明的申曲家們，於心何忍？</p>
<p>現在是中華民族生死絕續的偉大抗戰時代，每一個中國人都是戰士中的一員，倘使誰的行為背悖抗戰，必然地會受到羣衆的指摘和共棄：過去，不是上海電影界因攝製怪謬的神怪影片而給一羣作家譜誡過嗎？前車覆轍，後車殷鑒：希望申曲從業員們，幡然悔悟。從此以後，多多演唱有益世道人心以及含有國防意味的劇本。實大衆之幸，亦國家之幸！</p>

<h3>Britain's Far East Policy Unchanged: Not Recognizing Situations Created by Force; Maintaining Close Contact with All Related Countries; Considering Assistance to China at All Times; Lord Strabolgi Enumerates Japanese Crimes</h3>
<p>(London) During today's House of Lords meeting, Lord Strabolgi delivered a speech severely criticizing Japan's arrogant behavior in the war against China. The vehemence of his wording was rarely heard in both the upper and lower houses when discussing Japan's actions in China. Strabolgi stated in his speech that: (1) the war is currently being waged with extreme brutality and savagery; (2) the Japanese authorities in "Manchukuo" are deliberately using opium and other drugs to poison the Chinese people; (3) the Japanese military is systematically destroying Chinese universities and research institutions everywhere; (4) corrupt and shameless regimes have emerged in the Japanese-occupied areas, acting arbitrarily and engaging in all kinds of evil; (5) the Japanese military's attacks on fishing boats constitute the most hateful crimes. Strabolgi also emphasized that the battles being fought by the Chinese army today are no less than battles for Great Britain. The main purpose of Strabolgi's speech was to request the government to provide information on the war in China. Strabolgi also paid special attention to the situation in South China, asking the following questions in his speech: (1) What steps is the government taking to protect British trade interests? (2) What is the situation regarding the Japanese military's invasion of Hainan Island? (3) Has the government engaged in any joint policy with other relevant powers to end the war?</p>
<p>Strabolgi's speech stated that raising this issue now is by no means intended to antagonize the British government. The Duke of Plymouth's speech in the House of Lords on December 6th of last year, in response to the debate on the China issue, expressed a firm attitude towards this issue of great importance to British interests in China. Unexpectedly and to the delight of the audience, his words contained a clear warning to let the Japanese know that our patience is not endless. However, since then, several very important events have occurred in China, such as the sudden invasion of Hainan Island, the virtual blockade of a large part of Hong Kong since the fall of Guangzhou, and the various threats made by the Japanese authorities to the Shanghai International Settlement. Fortunately, Japan has changed its attitude today, and the so-called Nanjing government is actually using bizarre language to oppose the British and French people in the Public Concession, which is truly outrageous.</p>
<p>Strabolgi stated directly that the Japanese military's invasion of Hainan Island was purely provocative. In terms of fighting the Chinese central government, occupying the island serves no military purpose. The French authorities in Vietnam, after being requested by Japan, have prevented munitions, and even Red Cross supplies, from being transported to China. Japan then agreed to recognize Hainan Island as part of France's sphere of interest and not attack it, as a reward. Today, the French can see what the Japanese have rewarded them with. From this alone, it can be seen that the so-called "appeasement" policy is, in Japan's case, utterly useless.</p>
<p>Strabolgi concluded by mentioning the new automobile highway between Burma and southwestern China, saying that this is the only language the Japanese warlords can understand. If they broaden their horizons and look at the overall situation, they can see that the Chinese are fighting for us today. If the Japanese army had been able to break the Chinese army's resistance within ninety days two years ago, how long would it have taken to directly threaten Hong Kong, then Malaya, and then the Dutch East Indies? If Japan had subdued the Chinese, and if we were entangled in some disputes in Europe, would anyone dare to say that British interests in the Pacific would be safe and untouched? Strabolgi emphasized that the war against China today is not an old-fashioned war of conquest. It is being waged with extreme brutality and savagery. "The Japanese authorities in Manchuria are deliberately using opium and other drugs to ensnare the Chinese people. Any Chinese university or research institution is being systematically destroyed. Corrupt and shameless regimes have emerged in the Japanese-occupied areas, acting arbitrarily and engaging in all kinds of evil. European and American businesses are being excluded. The Foreign Office is aware of the tragic atrocities that have occurred. When Nanjing was occupied, the Japanese authorities ordered soldiers to engage in violence, and even British and American representatives were insulted. They have repeatedly criticized the German regime, but on this occasion, the actions of the Nanjing Kuomintang officials were admirable in their resoluteness. They helped refugees escape, saving them from the massacre and defilement by the barbaric and undisciplined Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Strabolgi went on to condemn the Japanese military's attacks on helpless fishing boats, saying that the sea is a place of shared peace, and the people on the fishing boats are all Chinese sailors, a truly excellent people who always lend a hand when ordinary disasters occur at sea. They take their wives and children with them, but the Japanese military attacks them with airplanes. This is a truly hateful act, and it is impossible to find words to adequately condemn it. He believes that the government has protested to the Japanese government, and he is not criticizing the government for turning a blind eye to this tragedy.</p>
<p>Strabolgi then referred to the German Nazi officials in Nanjing, saying that he had received information that German merchants were just as alarmed and uneasy as British merchants about everything China was experiencing. The German officials were the ones who took a supportive and comforting attitude to deal with the Japanese authorities. Therefore, there is now a great opportunity for the German government to demonstrate its loyalty, humanity, and desire for peace. The method is to unite with us and other relevant powers to apply diplomatic or economic pressure to curb the efforts of the Japanese warlords in China. Chamberlain's policy of appeasement has brought great benefits to Germany. If Germany is willing to make a small return, there is an opportunity in China, where German interests are the same as ours. Hitler recently announced that Germany must export goods, or we will perish. China has a vast market. If Japan's policy in China is successfully implemented, the Germans will have no chance to obtain it. After two years of fierce fighting, everyone knows that Japan is an economically vulnerable country. If Japan is subjected to economic pressure at this time, it will be easily defeated.</p>
<p>Our friends in China, and the compatriots of the Chinese nation, millions of whom live in our eastern territories and are good citizens, do not understand why we are not more actively seeking to end this tragic war. Before this military effort is realized, Japanese businesses in China can make great strides. However, the Japanese warlords do not want to see a peaceful, strong, and unified China. The younger generation of warlords, who seem to control the policies of the Japanese government, do not conceal their goals. If they succeed, they will undoubtedly threaten Australia. Members of all parties have no illusions about this issue. The time is now to implement justice, righteousness, and fairness. This kind of Christianity and humanitarianism has been greatly devastated in Europe and Asia Minor in the past six months. Evil is rampant, and human civilization and morality have been expelled. Can we not begin to advocate this great doctrine in Asia, as a remedy for what remains after the catastrophe? We can rely on the sincere assistance of India, Australia, and New Zealand. I believe that the Soviet Union, France, and the Netherlands will also respond. The policy I advocate is a peaceful policy that can be achieved without firing a shot. I believe that the League of Nations should have done this work more than two years ago. In any case, if the British government seeks to exert collective pressure diplomatically, and if necessary, economically and then financially, we believe its power will be sufficient. The lessons needed are that cruel force, terror, and bestial ferocity will gain nothing, but only invite inevitable punishment."</p>
<p>The Duke of Plymouth, representing the government, replied that the difficulty in dealing with this issue lies in giving practical effect to any desires or emotions we may have. He largely sympathized with what Lord Strabolgi had said, but he wondered whether Strabolgi had carefully considered the feasibility of implementing some of his suggestions.</p>
<p>After reporting on recent events in China, Plymouth described the actions taken by the British government to protect British interests in China, especially in Hong Kong. He said that the Pearl River is extremely important to Hong Kong's trade. The Sino-British treaty of 1842 stipulated the opening of the Pearl River for British trade. When the Chinese authorities first blockaded the river on October 13th of last year, the British Consul-General in Guangzhou protested to the Chinese side. Since the Japanese military occupied Guangzhou, they have continued to blockade the Pearl River. The British government has been actively working to reopen it, but these efforts have not yet been effective. The British government is now considering the possibility of taking further measures to achieve this goal. In short, the British government insists on continuing to operate as it currently does, and will do everything in its power to ensure that British trade and shipping in Japanese-occupied areas are not subject to discrimination in favor of Japanese or any other interests. According to recent information, although the Guangzhou Customs is not firmly under Japanese control, it is to some extent controlled by the Japanese, as is the case with the Shanghai Customs. Some Japanese personnel have been added to its staff. The same is true of the Hainan Island Customs. The Guangzhou Customs administration was able to remain safe and sound during the Japanese military's attack on and occupation of Guangzhou, thanks to the courage and perseverance of Mr. Happer, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs at the Guangdong Customs at the time.</p>
<p>Plymouth then recounted the various facts of the occupation of Hainan Island, and cited the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that the duration of the Japanese military's occupation of the island would be determined by military needs. He later said that while he knew the significance of this matter in terms of military strategy or tactics, he could not say that Britain had any truly important interests on the island. However, the position of the French government was undoubtedly different from that of Britain. The French government's treaty position was based on China's guarantee in 1897 not to cede the island to another country, and the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. As for Britain, it had no such agreement with Japan. What is related to this situation is only the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Plymouth felt it was difficult to judge whether Lord Strabolgi's claim that the Japanese actions were not intended to threaten the position of the Chinese government, but rather to threaten or worry the British and French governments. What he could say was that the reason given by the Japanese to the British was the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita regarding the need for the military situation, which Lord Strabolgi had quoted. This statement was very ambiguous, but this was the position that the Japanese government had explained to the British.</p>
<p>Plymouth spoke of the situation in Tianjin, saying that the current situation in Tianjin, generally speaking, was similar to what he had reported last December. The British government had made it clear to the Japanese government that the British authorities in the Tianjin British Concession had no intention of not cooperating, and were prepared to arrest anyone who had committed acts of terrorism or other crimes and hand them over to the Japanese side, but only after the Japanese side had presented sufficient evidence to prove the person's guilt and that the case had indeed been established.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the British government's Far East policy is based on the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the British government, without mincing words, had stated explicitly in its note to the Japanese government on January 14th that the British government could not recognize any changes made by force or unilateral action that involved the violation or abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty. The British government also could not agree with the claim that the Nine-Power Treaty was outdated or that its provisions were no longer suitable for the situation. The changes in the current situation were caused by the Japanese government's violation of the treaty. The British government believes that the treaty is permanent. If the Japanese government or any other signatory country puts forward constructive suggestions on what it believes can improve the treaty, the British government is prepared to consider them and negotiate these amendments jointly with other signatory countries. The British government is also prepared to reopen negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality after peace is restored. Although the note, including the above points, was sent to the Japanese government on January 14th, the Japanese government has not yet responded. He had just said that, in the British government's opinion, any measure, such as those mentioned by Lord Strabolgi, unless it is a plan that can be implemented effectively, may not be truly beneficial in solving this kind of difficulty. Because if the various economic sanctions mentioned by Lord Strabolgi were to be implemented, it would be absolutely necessary for all parties involved to act unanimously and simultaneously. The British government has assisted the Chinese government in various ways in extremely difficult circumstances. He would like the House to pay attention to this. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the British government has kept Hong Kong open as a route for Chinese transportation, but this route is no longer available after the fall of Guangzhou. Britain has also built a road from Burma to the Chinese border. Recently, the British government has obtained the power under the Export Guarantees Act and used it to provide more convenient guarantees to China. In short, the British government is always considering the general situation and never lets it out of mind.</p>
<p>Some people ask if we can put pressure on the Japanese government so that the war in China can end sooner. In his opinion, it is difficult and also wrong to say that there is currently an image that can achieve this goal. The British government is constantly consulting closely with relevant countries on events relating to their common interests, in order to obtain solutions that are fair to both sides and also take appropriate account of the interests of third countries. The British government has also notified the governments of China and Japan, informing them that the British government is prepared to use its good offices at any time and is willing to take all necessary steps when the time is appropriate. He must now admit that since he spoke in the House of Lords last December, the situation does not appear to have changed in any way on this point. He cannot consider that the time is ripe. After hearing the reply, Lord Strabolgi thanked Plymouth, and the matter was then shelved (Reuters report, 1st).</p>
<h3>US and Britain Closely Watching Security of Shanghai Concession; Electric Fence Around Tianjin Concession; Britain, US, and France Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth said in the House of Lords today in response to Lord Strabolgi's speech that the British government has now called the Japanese government's attention to the fact that the UK is very concerned about the ongoing discussions between the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Japanese authorities. Since the re-emergence of terrorist incidents in Shanghai, the Japanese authorities have made some suggestions to the Municipal Council, requesting that it maintain law and order more effectively. The British government is continuing to monitor the situation closely and is prepared to provide the Municipal Council with possible advice and assistance at any time. It is reported that the American ambassador has also made similar representations. Mr. Ede also said that the government deeply regrets the occurrence of such riots, but it cannot report any other news to the House of Lords. This matter is currently being discussed between the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and the Municipal Council. Mr. Plymouth also mentioned the news reported by various newspapers that the Nanjing "Reformed Government" had declared a silent war on the Public Concession and British and French ships for allegedly assisting General Chiang Kai-shek. He said that the British government had not yet received any verification of this from the British ambassador. He believes that the British government should wait until it has received information about this matter before considering the issue of making representations to Tokyo. We should not forget that the British government has not recognized the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and therefore should not attach too much importance to any statements made by that government. (Reuters report, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) It has been officially confirmed that the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States have protested to the Japanese authorities on the basis of humanitarianism regarding the construction of electrified barbed wire fences around the Tianjin Concession by the Japanese. (Reuters report, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, To Be Developed As Naval Port: Reactions to Japanese Occupation of the Island</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources in Hanoi, the Vietnamese government announced on February 25th that it was closing Cam Ranh Bay. All ships except French warships are prohibited from entering. It appears that the French government is beginning to build fortifications in the bay, and its strength will be comparable to that of Singapore. (Reuters report, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Editorial: Reflections on Education</h3>
<p>The National Education Conference was duly opened in Chongqing on the first of this month. It is said that there are many important cases to be decided at the meetings over the next few days. Education is a major matter relating to the entire nation and race, and relating to the modern and future generations. It is not like a professional field, nor is it merely a temporary measure. Moreover, in this era of resistance and national reconstruction, it bears the mission of inheriting the past and ushering in the future. Therefore, it is surely not just the reporter's personal wish to pray that this conference will shoulder the heavy responsibility of a century and live up to the high expectations of all parties.</p>
<p>What are the major issues facing Chinese education today, and how can these major issues be resolved? All these specialized questions relating to education depend on educators to use their insightful knowledge to study and answer them. We trust the experts and will not waste words on our own account. However, when education is mentioned, there are always certain reflections that rise and fall in my chest. Although I am a small and insignificant person and not involved in the education field, I can examine how the education I received at various levels in my youth and adolescence has influenced my character and behavior. I recall my school life, school discipline, the teachings of my teachers, and how the teachers influenced each other as role models. And after leaving school and entering society, how did I come to know, how did I act, and how did I learn? All this is personal experience. Decades have passed and even now, hearing the word "education" inevitably evokes endless reflections that I cannot suppress. I have witnessed relatives and fellow villagers entering school, dropping out, or graduating. The years pass and the mind and body are exhausted, and all the time there are problems. Children must be educated. Therefore, before they attend school, we choose a school, seeking one where the teachers, academic atmosphere, facilities, environment, and fees are all problem-free. And after they enter school, we worry that they will not study and that their studies will be poor, and we also worry that they will study hard but be influenced by bad habits. We rigorously correct them, but often there are problems. This again is related to education and we cannot remain indifferent, and so we cannot help but have reflections on education. Setting aside my own small self and looking elsewhere, the foreign invasion is the most serious test for the country, and the War of Resistance is the most serious test for past education, on the military, political, economic, national, and social fronts. What have we learned from this test? In the twenty months of the War of Resistance, the strengths and weaknesses of the nation and society have been fully exposed. What strengths are there that can be attributed to past education? What weaknesses are there for which past education cannot escape blame? I will not analyze this question in detail here. In short, the current situation makes people reflect without thinking on the urgent need for a thorough reform of education, so that we may have a people who can overcome the great task of recovery and restoration.</p>
<p>From the above, the problem is truly great. We must address it with all the knowledge and power relating to education, like a general mobilization in the military. We must implement the national education policy, like a strict and uniform military order that is swiftly executed. We must catch up urgently, like a life-or-death, win-or-lose melee. Therefore, an educational revolution is necessary to complete the transformation of the nation. This cannot be achieved by the efforts of a single hand or foot. If we seek results in the small and near, there are several points that I appeal to the general public: Those who do not have a commitment to education should not enter the education field for profit, should not enter the education field for power, should not treat it as a transition, should not treat it as a pastime, and should not enter the education field because they have extra time and energy to supplement their income, this is the first point. Those who aspire to devote themselves to education should first examine the joys and hardships of engaging in education, and understand the meaning of engaging in education. If their aspirations are insufficient, they must cultivate sufficient scholarship, and they must cultivate their character and conduct so that they can be role models. If they have any internal shame, they should not do it. This is the second point. Those who are already serving in the education field must have a spirit of contentment in poverty and perseverance, and devote themselves to it for life. They must take morality as the foundation of personality education, and they must also diligently study, always standing on the front line of scholarship. They should take education as their duty to students, and they should bear the responsibility of education to the country, and they should consider it a great shame and dereliction of duty if their students do not become successful. This is the third point. Those who are not in the education field but have a connection to the education cause should advocate for education and promote education, this goes without saying. However, they must first respect teachers, and must not damage teachers or insult education with political or commercial measures, or any other measures outside the nature of education. Nor should they entice good teachers to leave education for any reason, reason, or motive. This is the fourth point. Compared to the solemn and great issue of education as a whole, these four points may seem irrelevant, but if the general public can accept these four points, not only can the atmosphere of education be clarified, but I also deeply believe that it will be able to improve the effectiveness of education.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States in Asia Express Deep Sympathy for China's Resistance War; Frugality in Meals and Fundraising to Actively Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to diplomatic sources, the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States in Southern Asia recently held a conference in Hyderabad, Deccan, India, and resolved to send two representatives, Reverend Mandore from India and Reverend An Qing from Burma, to China to show the Church's friendship to China. The two, along with five representatives from China attending the World Missionary Conference, set off from Yangon by car and arrived in Yunnan after eight days. They then went to Chengdu for sightseeing and arrived in Chongqing last week. The two were deeply sympathetic and admired the spirit of China's heroic self-defense war of resistance. When interviewed by reporters today, Reverend Mandore said in a sincere and excited tone, "We are deeply moved by the spirit of sacrifice and courage of the Chinese nation and the construction undertakings in the southwestern provinces. The Indian nation loves peace and good neighborliness and hates war and believes in the policy of non-violent resistance." Mr. Mandore said that the Indian nation believes that outsiders should not stand by or only offer empty sympathy for China's resistance war but should have more concrete expressions. India is a buyer of Japanese goods, so the Indian people all know that boycotting Japanese goods is enough to help China. People in Calcutta and other Indian cities have previously designated a certain day as "Aid China Day" and donated from house to house on that day to relieve Chinese refugees. The enthusiastic aid to China by Indian youth is particularly commendable, and the churches in India are working hard. Each church has held an "Aid China Week." During these seven days, the people in the church only eat vegetarian food to save money to relieve Chinese refugees. After the war of resistance, a noteworthy event occurred in the Indian cultural circles. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the famous Japanese poet Noguchi wrote to the Indian poet Tagore, saying that Japan was not fighting to conquer China, but to build Asia for Asians. Tagore immediately replied, "China is an invincible country. I am confident that the Japanese will eventually wake up from their confusion. I love the Japanese people and hope that Japan will regret its success in this war." Mr. Meng then added that India really supports China's policy of resistance, and after the last All-India Representative Congress, it sent an Indian rescue team to China to serve. Recently, the Methodist Episcopal Church of Southern Asia also resolved to urge Indians to boycott Japanese goods, and it is expected that when the next All-India Congress is held, there will be further actions. When I return to India, I will report the situation in China to Indian leaders such as Gandhi and Tagore, etc." After the interview with Mandore, the reporter had a brief conversation with the Burmese representative, Mr. An Qing. According to him, in the past 60 years, because Japan was a first-class power, Burma also regarded it as an ideal country in the Far East. The price of Japanese goods shipped to Burma was very low, which caused the prices of goods in Burma to fall. Therefore, Burmese people regarded Japan as their savior. However, today Burma has gradually lost its trust in Japan because the Burmese people know that what Japan has done is almost the same as the economic invasion of small and weak countries by other imperialist countries. As far as Burma is concerned, either be pro-British or pro-Japanese, but the Burmese people all believe that it is better to maintain their existing relationship with Britain than to be pro-Japanese. As for China, Burma is extremely sympathetic to China's resistance war. The Burmese Women's Association has donated funds to all walks of life to relieve Chinese refugees, and all Christians are also assisting China materially and spiritually. Mr. An Qing finally said that Japan has done its best to promote publicity in Burma, and even uses scholarships to encourage Burmese students to study in Japan. According to reports, after arriving in Chongqing, the two pastors, Mandore and An Qing, visited President Kong, President Sun, and Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, etc. separately. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Madam Chiang Kai-shek also scheduled a meeting. (1st dispatch)</p>

The reason for this is that the southwest of China often has heavy dew in winter, and the airport surfaces are not flat, so they are easily damaged. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Pope of Rome, Pacelli Elected, Title is Pius XII, Tens of Thousands Crowd St. Peter's Square</h3>
<p>Vatican City - Papal Secretary of State Pacelli was elected Pope today, taking the title Pius XII. Pacelli has served as Secretary of State for nine years. (February 2nd, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Vatican City - Thirty-five thousand people gathered in St. Peter's Square today, all eyes fixed on the sixty-foot-high chimney. The smoke emerging from the chimney would indicate that a new Pope had been chosen. A high platform was specially built at a location easily visible from the square to broadcast the news via radio. At 10 a.m., a wisp of black smoke rose, indicating that the first ballot had not produced a candidate. A second ballot was held at 11:28 a.m. The black smoke indicated that this ballot was also inconclusive, as no one had received the necessary two-thirds majority. When the black smoke appeared, some in the crowd, unable to clearly distinguish the color, thought the first plume looked white and began to cheer. Minutes later, when the smoke turned black, they were disappointed. A total of four ballots will be cast today. After lunch, private meetings were held in the chambers below, discussing the leading archbishops from this morning's ballots and the significant changes regarding those who seemed likely to be elected candidates. Archbishops who did not wish to meet with other archbishops had wooden barriers erected outside their doors, forming a St. Andrew's cross pattern. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italy and Poland Uphold Common Interests, Promote Friendly Cooperation, Italy Attempts to Alienate France and Poland, Foreign Minister Ciano's Trip Fails</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, having completed his reciprocal visit to Poland, departed from Krakow last night with his wife and entourage to return home. Yesterday morning, Ciano visited the tomb of the late President Pilsudski to lay a wreath. In the afternoon, he attended a banquet at the Wawel Royal Castle at the invitation of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. (February 2nd, Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Regarding the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the Polish government issued a communique before Minister Ciano's departure, stating, "Both sides solemnly declare that the policies they pursue are based on order and justice, and that they will continue to promote friendly cooperation in accordance with their common interests." (February 1st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Warsaw was intended to persuade Poland to remain neutral between France and Italy, so that Italy could act as it wished in the Mediterranean without worries. However, the results were not as desired. The French newspapers expressed their relief upon hearing the news. (February 2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw - During Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland, the anti-German demonstrations by Polish university students were the most intriguing. Although this movement could not be seen as hostile to Italy, it was still embarrassing that the students' opposition was directed at Beck's policies, even though Foreign Minister Beck was hosting Foreign Minister Ciano. Italy had hoped that a warm atmosphere would be spontaneously created in Warsaw upon Minister Ciano's arrival, as is common in totalitarian countries, but this did not happen, which was unexpected. It is reported that Ciano discussed three issues during his visit: first, Poland's relationship with the German-Italian axis; second, the Danube River region issue; and third, Italy's territorial demands. Regarding the first point, Foreign Minister Beck had clearly stated, before the anti-German demonstrations occurred, that Polish foreign policy had always maintained a detached position towards all totalitarian blocs. Before Ciano's visit, he also announced that he would travel to London in early March, possibly followed by a trip to Paris. Regarding the second point, it is difficult to precisely define the policies of Poland and Italy in Central Europe. Certain newspapers of the Polish detachment faction claimed that since Germany and Austria had merged, Germany's influence in Hungary had also increased, and Italy's position in Central Europe had weakened, making it difficult to pursue any ambitions. Moreover, Berlin regards Central Europe as Germany's exclusive domain, making it difficult for Poland and Italy to intervene. Regarding the third point, Poland's attitude was extremely ambiguous. Foreign Minister Ciano repeatedly raised the issue of redistributing world colonies, but Foreign Minister Beck remained silent and noncommittal. He repeatedly emphasized the continued validity of the Franco-Polish alliance treaty, leaving no room for doubt. In short, Foreign Minister Ciano's trip was unsuccessful, and the Italian government and public opinion should therefore adopt a cautious attitude. (February 2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Supplementary Budget Exceeds 5.2 Billion Yen, Based on Ability to Confront China and Russia Simultaneously, Issuance of Bonds Unbearable for the People</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Japanese Cabinet has approved a supplementary budget for the army and navy totaling 5,270,000,000 yen, of which 4,600,000,000 yen will cover the expenses of the China Incident from February 1939 to March 1940. This budget is based on the so-called "two-power standard," as Japan aims to be fully prepared to confront China and the Soviet Union simultaneously if necessary. The army's expenses are 3,140,000,000 yen, the navy's expenses are 810,000,000 yen, with 650,000,000 yen allocated as a reserve fund and the remaining 670,000,000 yen included in the supplementary recurring budget, of which 490,000,000 yen will be allocated to the army and 180,000,000 yen to the navy. It is said that these funds will be used to strengthen general national defense. The Asahi Shimbun elaborates on this budget, stating that bonds worth 2,456,000,000 yen have not yet been issued for this year, and the issuance of bonds next year will reach 5,732,000,000 yen. Since August 1937, the total expenses for the China Incident have exceeded 11,990,000,000 yen, which is seven times greater than the cost of the Russo-Japanese War. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - According to the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun," based on the government's proposed supplementary national defense budget yesterday, Japan's total expenditure on the war in China has reached 11,990,000,000,000 yen. In other words, every Japanese citizen, regardless of age or gender, bears a burden of 120 yen. (February 1st, Haitong dispatch)</p>
<h3>Conference of Japanese Envoys to Europe Held in Berlin, Discussing Expansion of German-Italian-Japanese Alliance, To Counter the Democratic Nations' Front</h3>
<p>(London) - According to today's News Chronicle, several Japanese ambassadors and ministers will meet in Berlin tomorrow to discuss how to draft an alliance between Italy, Germany, and Japan, aimed at confronting Britain and France (or including the United States) rather than solely targeting the Soviet Union. Japan is currently organizing an iron front against the Soviet Union and democratic nations for self-defense, to avoid the consequences of reckless military action in China. Efforts in this regard have recently become more active, but the European Axis powers seem to be wavering on the suitability of forming an alliance. According to sources of Reuters in London, if this meeting takes place, it is unlikely to have special significance. Neither the Japanese Embassy nor other sources know about this meeting. The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, will not be going to Berlin. Shigemitsu is an important figure in Japanese diplomatic circles, and since he is not making this trip, the meeting is unlikely to discuss issues as significant as reported by the News Chronicle. Sources in various Japanese circles say that the mission of the three officials who were scheduled to leave Japan for Europe at the end of January to discuss the final steps of converting the anti-communist pact into a formal military alliance is unrelated to this issue. Furthermore, according to sources in London, it is not a special event for Japanese diplomats in Europe to hold a meeting for ordinary matters. The general sentiment in London is that, regardless of the wishes of other Axis powers (about which there is no news at present), Japan is particularly unwilling to take on any responsibilities in European disputes, as this seems more harmful than beneficial.

I was asking a passerby what it was when I heard a deafening explosion. The doors and windows of nearby shops were shattered. I was very scared and ran back." The continuous explosions caused extreme panic among the people throughout the West Kyoto-Osaka area. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Minister of War Itagaki stated in the House of Representatives today that he regretted the explosion at the armory near Osaka. However, the military operations of the Japanese army at the front will not be hindered by this explosion. Although there is nothing to be gleaned from this, it is sufficient to show that the explosion must have a background. (February 2nd, dispatch)</p>
<p>Kobe - The Hirakata armory between Kyoto and Osaka suddenly exploded yesterday (February 1st) at 3 p.m., reducing almost the entire town to ashes and causing enormous loss of life and property. It is now reported that the Kyoto Metropolitan Police Department has learned that the explosion of this military armory was evidently sabotaged by "Japanese traitors," so they immediately mobilized special forces to investigate. (February 2nd, Kuai Xun She dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - This morning, reports from Osaka stated that after the explosion and fire at the Army armory in Mayeda Town, the entire town has been reduced to ashes, leaving tens of thousands of residents homeless.

<p>(Tokyo) - According to today's official report, the result of yesterday's explosion at the Osaka Hirakata Army armory was 22 dead, 569 injured, and 153 missing. After the fire broke out at the armory at 2:40 p.m. yesterday, the explosions continued for four hours. It is known that 6 army personnel were killed, 50 were injured, and 2 were missing. The rest were civilians. It is reported that 3 policemen rescued 30 armory workers from the fire and then disappeared. Another policeman was seriously injured. Within a mile radius of the armory, 800 houses were completely destroyed and 100 were partially destroyed. According to a statement from the Tokyo Ministry of the Army, the Hirakata armory caught fire at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, and an investigation into the cause of the fire immediately began. It is evident that the fire was caused by carelessness in handling explosives. The Ministry of the Army has dispatched Vice Minister Yamawaki to lead a team of rescuers to the disaster area. Hirakata Town has a population of 27,160 and 5,950 houses. When the fire was raging, it threatened to destroy everything, but a large infantry battalion, a company of engineers, 1,000 policemen dispatched from Osaka, and 200 firefighters rushed to put out the fire, which was extinguished late last night. Within 50 minutes of the incident, the authorities ordered all residents of the town to evacuate immediately. The victims took refuge in Osaka and other places, and the injured were sent to the army hospitals and Red Cross hospitals in Osaka and other places.

It is reported that a worker accidentally dropped a bomb on the gunpowder when pouring explosives into it, causing this major disaster. At the time, the armory guards and workers tried to put out the fire, but the fire was raging and spread rapidly, and the rooms storing gunpowder were destroyed one after another. The authorities have now dispatched military police to the area to guard against further incidents. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister Attends the House of Representatives, Reports on the International Situation, Willing to Negotiate with Italy Within the Scope of the Agreement, Situation in Central and Eastern Europe Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Foreign Minister Bonnet attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives this afternoon and presented reports on Hainan Island (see separate dispatch), Spain, Italy's territorial demands, Central and Eastern Europe, and the United States' sale of aircraft to France. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Spanish issue, Foreign Minister Bonnet first explained the circumstances surrounding the French government's decision to recognize the Nationalist government. He stated that Senator Peyral's discussions with the Nationalist government authorities had resulted in an agreement, and both sides would establish good-neighborly relations. General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, would issue a reply to the British and French governments, providing assurances on maintaining independence and refraining from retaliatory measures against Republican government personnel. General Franco has reportedly instructed General Gambara, commander of the Italian volunteer forces, to have the Italian volunteer forces leave Spain as soon as possible. General Gambara has returned to Rome to report to the government. Foreign Minister Jordana of the Nationalist government has also assured Peyral that Italian and German combatants would withdraw from Spain. As for the Republican government, several leaders, including certain military officers, have agreed to quickly end the civil war.</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's territorial demands, Britain and France have a joint relationship and a completely consistent attitude. This can be seen from the recent statements made to Parliament by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax. France is still prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy within the scope of the January 7, 1935, Franco-Italian agreement. This position has not changed.</p>
<p>Regarding the issues in Central and Eastern Europe, the situation in these areas has improved, and France's influence in Yugoslavia, Poland, and Romania has also increased. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck told Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday that Poland would remain steadfast in its commitment to the Franco-Polish alliance treaty. Ciano's trip was unsuccessful, and the Italian government was disappointed.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the United States selling a large number of aircraft to France, President Roosevelt's position is extremely important. (February 1st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Italian Reservists</p>
<p>Called Up for Enlistment</p>
<p>Actively Training Youth</p>
<p>Joining the Air Force</p>
<p>Rome - A proclamation was issued here today calling up reservists from the 1915 to 1918 classes. It is estimated that 60,000 to 200,000 people will be affected. According to official statements, this call-up is routine, affecting the entire 1918 class and other three classes who were deemed unqualified and refused enlistment in previous years. According to foreign sources, the only reason for Italy's sudden call-up of four classes of reservists is the need to maintain military quotas. It should be noted that the number of people in the classes called up after this is very small due to the low birth rate during the war. According to population statistics, 435,000 boys were born in 1915, 377,000 in 1916, 231,000 in 1917, 240,000 in 1918, and 274,000 in 1939. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>British-Soviet Celebration</p>
<p>Soviet Embassy</p>
<p>Entertains British Dignitaries</p>
<p>(London) - Soviet Ambassador Maisky held a banquet last night. In addition to Prime Minister Chamberlain, the guests included Home Secretary Hoare and his wife, Lord Privy Seal Anderson, Foreign Secretary Plymouth, Conservative Party hardliner Churchill, and members of the diplomatic corps. It can be said that the occasion was a grand one. Prime Minister Chamberlain's attendance at the Soviet Embassy banquet in his capacity as leader of the Conservative Party is unprecedented since the establishment of the Soviet regime. The local newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, have attached great importance to this and stated that this is further evidence of the rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union. It also shows that Prime Minister Chamberlain is not swayed by ideological differences. (February 2nd, Havas)</p>

<h3>General Pétain Appointed French Ambassador to Spain, Morale of Spanish Nationalist Army Boosted, Civil War May Reignite</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The Council of Ministers recently decided to appoint General Pétain, a renowned general from the European War, as Ambassador to the Spanish Nationalist government. (February 2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) - General Pétain is 83 years old this year. It is reported that the Cabinet asked him to come out of retirement to be the first Ambassador to the Spanish Nationalist government. He initially declined due to his age, but Prime Minister Daladier repeatedly urged him, explaining the importance of the mission and that he could not do without his help. Pétain finally agreed. Pétain joined the army in 1876 and held important positions in the military. He gained widespread fame during the European War and was promoted to Chief of the General Staff of the French Army in 1917. He was later promoted to the rank of Marshal. After the end of the war, he was promoted to the rank of General. With such a brilliant career, it is no wonder Daladier repeatedly urged him to take on the role. (February 2nd, Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) - The Paris Evening News recently speculated that the Spanish Civil War may reignite, citing a statement by Foreign Minister Vayá of the Republican government that the soldiers on the front lines of the Republican army are very disciplined and orderly, and their morale is therefore strong. According to Vayá, everyone, both at the front and in the rear, is able to fulfill their responsibilities, so there is no need to worry about the future of the war. Vayá also invited reporters to visit the front lines of the army to prove the truth of his words. (February 2nd, Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. Air Force Strength Unmatched by Other Nations; Production Can Be Increased to a Thousand Aircraft Per Month; Army Air Corps Greatly Expanded</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the testimony given by Army Air Corps Deputy Chief Arnold to the Senate Military Committee today, the United States can have a very large air force in the event of war. He said that the new fighter planes currently possessed by the United States are not only able to compete with the superior fighter planes of any country, but their speed is even higher than that of any other country's fighter planes. At the same time, in terms of the current aircraft production capacity of the United States, at least 12,000 aircraft can be produced annually. The newest U.S. fighter plane is the XFM-1, which has multiple seats and is produced by the Bayer Aircraft Factory. The manufacturing rights have never been sold to any foreign country. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) A congressional committee today released information about the strength and plans of the U.S. Air Force, stating that the U.S. Army has 879 assorted first-line military aircraft. In an emergency, it would take three years to increase U.S. aircraft production to 1,000 per month. Generally, this number is considered to be the aircraft production of Germany. Air Force Chief Major General Arnold declared today that the War Department plans to use annual appropriations, including funds requested by President Roosevelt, to purchase 565 assorted new aircraft. New explosives and aircraft made of adhesive materials are currently being tested, with the hope that this material will eventually enable the United States to continuously manufacture aircraft like concrete.

<p>Grants the President the Power to Declare War</p>
<p>Hull Opposes Amendment</p>
<p>(Washington) Twelve senators recently proposed a constitutional amendment to abolish the president's power to declare war and instead have it decided by a public referendum. Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers, expressing his opposition. He stated, "Regarding the prevention of the United States from being involved in the vortex of war," after careful study by the founding fathers, it was believed that only a government that could truly represent public opinion was a proper solution. This view is extremely wise and suitable for the times, and past experience can serve as proof. Indiana Democratic Congressman Ludlow previously proposed the same motion, which was decided by the House last January to not be brought up for discussion.</p>
<p>British Air Force Budget</p>
<p>Total Exceeds 200 Million Pounds</p>
<p>Increase of 50 Percent Compared to Previous Year</p>
<p>(London) The 1939-40 Air Force budget was recently announced by Air Minister Wood, with a total of £220,626,000.

Among these funds, £2,509,000 will be allocated to subsidize civil aviation. According to Wood, by March 31 of this year, the British Air Force will have 1,750 first-line aircraft and an air force strength of 118,000 personnel. In addition, 47 "barrage balloon squadrons" will be trained, with 10 squadrons used to reinforce the air defenses of London and the remaining 37 squadrons used to protect other important cities. As for the air force strength in overseas territories, it has increased by three squadrons in the 1938-39 fiscal year. All aircraft factories are currently engaged in manufacturing with full force, and the monthly manufacturing quantity has rapidly increased. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

It is reported that the detailed arrangements for transporting Saito's remains will be agreed upon by the U.S. Navy authorities and the Japanese diplomatic authorities in the United States.

<h3>General Göring States Germany is Expanding Air Force with Full Strength; German Dictionary Contains No Word "Fear"; Sharpening Swords to Prepare to Cut Down the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German General Göring gave a speech to military leaders and party members today, saying, "We must manufacture aircraft so that they are unimaginable to others in terms of both quality and quantity." Other notable quotes from Göring's speech included, "We must sharpen our swords to serve the safety of the German people," "The German dictionary contains no word for 'fear'," and "The German Air Force still needs great efforts in 1939." Göring also stated that he always believed that if the German people were given proper leadership and all their energy was focused on what was necessary, they could be "absolutely invincible." Because of the awareness of being able to rely on this military force, Hitler has the strength to resolve major national responsibilities with calm confidence and demand the unshakeable rights that the German nation should have. We can look beyond our borders and find several major countries with extreme arrogance, considering themselves protectors of culture, but in reality, they are all experiencing extreme military rearmament. Although the speeches of many politicians are filled with words of peace, Christianity, and good neighborliness, and undoubtedly, democracy, they are in fact devoting all their efforts to massive rearmament. To enable Germany to achieve the necessary starting point in the air force, we must first seek self-sufficiency in materials that foreign countries are unwilling to supply to Germany in the required quantities.

<h3>Hong Kong Feels Threatened; British Increase Border Defenses; Authorities Issue Naval Defense Ordinance</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: In the past week, Japanese troops invading Guangdong have continuously threatened the Hong Kong border. Those familiar with the international and Far East situation should be able to understand the motives and purposes behind this. The recent situation in Hong Kong is recorded below:</p>
<p>Border Situation: Since the Japanese troops suddenly attacked Nantou, which is connected to the Kowloon border, from the Taiping area of the Pearl River Estuary during the Lunar New Year, and sent aircraft to bomb Shenzhen, the British government has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side. Therefore, the Japanese troops attacking Nantou retreated after looting. However, according to news on the 20th, hundreds of Japanese troops occupied Nantou on that morning and set fire to the county government and various agencies. Fortunately, the women and children in the city had already been evacuated, so there were fewer casualties. At the same time, the customs officials stationed there also completely retreated into British territory. Moreover, Japanese aircraft have been hovering and bombing Shenzhen in the skies above Shenzhen, causing the residents of Shenzhen to flee completely, and even residents on the British side have moved to other places. Judging from this, it can be seen that the Japanese military's threat to Hong Kong is purely a planned action and will not be restrained by British negotiations and protests.</p>
<p>Live-Fire Exercises: Therefore, although the Hong Kong military authorities are trying their best to remain calm and patient, they have issued orders to the border guards stationed in the New Territories to begin various preparations in order to prevent any eventuality. If necessary, they can take self-defense actions. After receiving the order, the border guards have complied with everything. Therefore, since yesterday, the situation at the various key points on the border between China and Britain in the New Territories has been tense. At the same time, the artillery batteries are also conducting exercises day and night. On the afternoon of the 25th, from 6:00 PM to midnight, the Pak Sha Wan battery held a large-scale live-fire exercise, with the sound of cannons booming, as if the God of War had descended. According to news reports, London has also recently issued a "Hong Kong Naval Defense Ordinance," authorizing the British Admiralty, when necessary, to accept the Hong Kong government's request to mobilize the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force to formally join the British Navy, just like the British regular navy, in order to strengthen Hong Kong's naval combat power.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Attempt to Spy on Central Qiongzhou</p>
<p>Guangxi Troops Ordered to Deploy in Qinzhou and Lianzhou</p>
<p>Xuwen and Other Counties Have Declared Martial Law</p>
<p>The war in Qiongzhou is still in chaos. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army lured the Japanese troops deeper. It is reported that over a thousand Japanese troops, infantry and cavalry, have occupied Fushan and are attempting to spy on central Qiongzhou. However, the deeper they go, the more difficulties they will encounter. According to refugees from Qiongzhou, the Chinese army on Qiongzhou still maintains considerable strength. The self-defense corps and able-bodied men from various counties have gathered in various strategic areas, waiting for the enemy in a relaxed manner, using the mountainous terrain to fight, reducing the effectiveness of the Japanese air force and tanks. At the same time, the Chinese army has made full preparations in advance, with sufficient food and ammunition.</p>
<p>Qiongshan and Other Counties Are Scorched Earth</p>
<p>The current plan of the Japanese troops invading Qiongzhou is to first occupy the coastal ports to cut off the Chinese army's supplies. Therefore, they have landed successively in Haikou City, Yulin Port, and Qinglan Port. One force in Qinglan Port is currently invading Jiaji City in Qiongdong County. After fierce counterattacks by the Chinese army, they have been unable to make progress. In Qiongshan, Chengmai, and other counties where the Japanese troops have arrived, they have carried out large-scale looting. Refugees on the road have been subjected to inhuman air attacks by Japanese planes. No fewer than 500 people were shot to death during the evacuation of the people of Haikou, causing corpses to pile up along the roadsides, with no one to collect them. Haikou City used to be a prosperous area. Now, under the iron heels of the Japanese army, 70% to 80% of the residents have scattered and fled, and the city is desolate. Although the Japanese troops have instigated traitors to organize a puppet maintenance association, due to the obstruction of land transportation, ships that usually sail from various places to Haikou have also completely stopped running, causing food shortages and disrupting news. Citizens who were unable to leave Haikou for a time have moved to other places one after another. The county towns of Qiongshan, Wenchang, and Ding'an have been bombed by Japanese planes, and many civilian houses and shops have been destroyed by fire. Commerce has come to a standstill, and various market towns have fallen into chaos. Some refugees have detoured to Beihai, and then taken ships to Guangzhou Bay or Tokyo Bay, while others have fled to Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p>Various Counties Under Martial Law Evacuate Population</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese navy, army, and air force have repeatedly reinforced their forces in Hainan. It is estimated that there are no fewer than 40 Japanese gunboats, cruisers, and transport ships, two aircraft carriers, one flagship, and no fewer than 20,000 marines and Taiwanese conscripted troops. The Qiongzhou Strait has become controlled by the Japanese army. Haikou City faces the Leizhou Peninsula. With the loss of Haikou, Xuwen County in the Leizhou Strait is under severe threat from the Japanese air force. Even the various seaports belonging to Haikang County are in a state of fear. The county authorities of various counties have been ordered to issue martial law orders, evacuate people, relocate grain, destroy roads, and increase sentries along the coast. Xuwen County, because it is close to Qiongzhou Island, has the largest population evacuation, with nine out of ten shops empty. The urban and rural areas are maintained by self-defense corps and strong men, and the coastal surveillance is very strict. All inbound travelers must undergo strict inspection before being allowed to enter. As for Japanese planes flying to Xuwen for reconnaissance, there is almost no day that they do not appear. There are more than a dozen places inside and outside the city that have been bombed, and the disaster area is vast.</p>
<p>Qinzhou and Lianzhou Are Tense, Guangxi Troops Reinforce</p>
<p>In addition, due to the fall of Qiongzhou Island, the two prefectures of Qinzhou and Lianzhou, which have lost their shields, have recently become tense again. Some Japanese warships and aircraft have been constantly observing Beihai and other places. Several Japanese warships once sailed to the sea near Guantouling and opened fire, and the next day, Japanese cruisers sailed to the sea of Qinzhou County to survey the waterways. The Qinzhou and Lianzhou defenders have recently stepped up their alert. The Guangxi provincial authorities, believing that Qinzhou and Lianzhou are close to the Guangxi border and that if there is an emergency there, Nanning and other places will be affected, specially transferred elite troops from Guangxi yesterday to Qinzhou and Lianzhou to reinforce the defenses. The Qinzhou County highway has already been dug in sections, and key points such as Guangxi are guarded by mechanized units. As for the Beihai coast, which is easily within range of Japanese naval guns, the authorities have made adequate preparations. In recent days, although ships from Beihai to Hong Kong have been traveling as usual, the number of passengers has decreased, and even fewer goods are being transported. Ships sailing from Hong Kong to Beihai now do not pass through the Qiongzhou Haikou, and only transport a small amount of meat when they arrive in Beihai, for the daily use of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Affected by Military Affairs in South China, Hong Kong Trade Declines from Prosperity</p>
<p>Eight Strange Aircraft Invade the Skies Above Hong Kong and Kowloon</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Japanese army invaded South China and surrounded Hong Kong on all sides, this colony of the British Empire in the recent Far East has been greatly threatened. More recently, due to the landing of the Japanese army on Hainan Island, the value of Hong Kong in the British Far East militarily and economically has also been greatly reduced. During the Lunar New Year, Japanese troops and aircraft constantly invaded the border and airspace of Hong Kong, and even openly dropped bombs and bombed trains within the British border. The occurrence of this incident clearly shows that the Japanese side intends to demonstrate to Britain and exert military pressure on Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another has risen. According to reliable sources, at 3:00 AM on February 2nd, eight strange aircraft suddenly flew over the skies of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and a tense situation suddenly appeared invisibly.</p>
<p>Stepping Up Air Defense</p>
<p>According to sources from relevant parties, around 3:00 AM on the deep night of the 22nd, a series of rattling sounds were heard in the skies above Hong Kong and Kowloon, which was very clear. Immediately, some people witnessed eight aircraft flying in formation in the clouds. After a few minutes, the shadows of the aircraft disappeared. At that time, more people saw them in Kowloon. As a result, the news spread, and those who heard it all determined that these eight strangely aircraft of unknown origin were undoubtedly Japanese aircraft. People have always believed that Hong Kong's air defenses are foolproof. Now, these strange aircraft have invaded for no reason. The authorities and the police have kept silent about this matter on the one hand, and denied it on the other, fearing that this would shake people's hearts and plunge society into unrest. However, the air defense authorities, led by Director Stilwell Perkins, issued a public statement in the newspapers, stating that Hong Kong's air defense equipment is being stepped up for deployment. Seven of the latest alarm machines have also been shipped from the United Kingdom and will soon be installed on suitable buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It was also said that in the near future, there will be another blackout. The ulterior motives are very obvious.</p>
<p>Commercial Decline</p>
<p>The heavy military threats have made the people of Hong Kong very uneasy. At the same time, the economic impact has also become increasingly severe due to the Japanese army's occupation of Guangzhou and the invasion of Qiongyai. The prosperity of Hong Kong's commerce depends entirely on the transportation along the coast of South China. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, Hong Kong's import trade has suffered a serious blow since transportation between Hong Kong and various places has been obstructed. This shows that there is no market for British and American goods in South China. According to the trade statistics released by the Hong Kong authorities a few days ago, the total value of Hong Kong's imports in January 1939 (this year) was 40.07 million yuan, a difference of 23 million yuan compared to the total value of imports of 63.7 million yuan in the same period of 1938 (last year). As for exports, because Hong Kong merchants sold off their accumulated inventory from last year at low prices this year, the total value was 40.2 million yuan, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to 39.41 million yuan in the same period last year. However, the export amount to various parts of China was only 2.3 million yuan, a decrease of 8 million yuan compared to 10.5 million yuan in the same period last year. This is also sufficient to show that the foreign goods transported from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland in January of this year have sharply decreased. At the same time, Hong Kong's imports from South China in January only amounted to 4.9 million yuan, a decrease of more than 60% compared to the same period last year. Recently, the Japanese army invaded Qiongyai and has attempted to invade Beihai in northern Guangdong. If the war in Beihai continues, Hong Kong's trade with the mainland will be completely cut off. Therefore, according to observations from relevant parties, Hong Kong's commerce this year will decline rapidly, and it is very likely that it will return to the sluggish situation of three years ago. Therefore, the tragic economic fate of Hong Kong at present is no different from the military threats it is experiencing.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Attack Zhangyan</p>
<p>Stalemate at Baziqiao</p>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: In recent days, the Chinese army has counterattacked Pinghu, threatening Jiaxing, which the Japanese army regards as a major problem. The commander of the Japanese army garrison in Songjiang summoned the Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, and puppet governors to discuss the siege. On the 28th of last month, the Japanese troops from Qingpu, Songjiang, and Jinshan took seven wooden-hulled motorboats pulled by Japanese ships and set off towards Zhangyan. Unexpectedly, at the Baziqiao area, which is four or five miles away from Zhangyan, the Chinese army's Ding and Shen divisions bravely resisted, and stray bullets hit two innocent farmers on the spot, all of whom were killed. There were also many injuries. The stalemate continued for two days and nights without retreat. The villages around Baziqiao were set on fire by the Japanese army. The Chen family's dozens of buildings were destroyed in the fire. Now, Japanese troops have also arrived in Tinglin, Songyin, Hougang, and Yexie, attempting to attack Xincang Town, but the Chinese army has sufficient strength, so the Japanese army has made no progress so far.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Outside Changxing</p>
<p>Changxing Correspondence: Yu Shuluan, who once served as the magistrate of Jiashan and Linhai Counties, is currently the magistrate of Changxing County and commander of the Anti-Japanese Guard. On the 24th of last month, he led his troops, together with the Wang regiment, bravely recaptured Mopan Mountain, seized two mountain cannons and five heavy machine guns, and resolutely defended against the Japanese army's attack. After the Chinese army defeated the invading Japanese troops, five Japanese soldiers were killed, and their corpses were taken away during the retreat and cremated in the open space in front of the former county government. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese army advanced to Shangliqiao, four miles away from Changxing County. The Japanese army in Changxing had only a hundred or so men, and the command post was located in Zhongshan Park. Thirty or so traitors, including Song Zhonglin, were sent in disguise to scout the movements of the Chinese army outside the city. Five of them were captured by the Chinese army and beheaded as a warning to the public. The Wuchang Highway, which connects to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, has been destroyed by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Loot Xitang</p>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: Xitang is the transportation center of the Jiashan waterway. Since Zhou City was set on fire by the Japanese army, the Xitang market has been abnormally prosperous. An ordinary store that usually has 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in business now has as much as 300,000 yuan. This has made it coveted by bandits. On Lunar New Year's Eve, the puppet troops of Cao Xianglin's unit carried out a full-scale looting of Xitang Town. The rice shops in Beizha, Wolong Bridge, and Mihangdai suffered the heaviest losses. Some wealthy merchants in the area have already moved elsewhere to take refuge.</p>

<p>Refugee Relief Association Encourages Fundraising for Educational Expenses; Schools Enthusiastically Participate; "Le Shan" Badges Hastily Added by 50,000</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Education Group's fundraising campaign for educational expenses. The association originally aimed to raise 100,000 yuan, but within two days, schools had already collected nearly 90,000 "Le Shan" badges from the Shanghai Bank. Those continuing to request additional badges include McTyeire School for Girls (2,000 badges), Shanghai High School (2,000 badges), Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School (1,500 badges), Shanghai University (1,300 badges), Hua Dong Public School (1,000 badges), Zheng Feng Middle School (1,000 badges), Jue Min Primary School (900 badges), Yu Cai Public School (700 badges), Kun Fan Girls' Middle School (500 badges), China Vocational School (500 badges), Tong Hui Primary School (500 badges), Xie Jin Primary School (400 badges), and other schools, totaling 15,000 badges. Schools are now actively fundraising, hoping to achieve the top spot in fundraising performance. Students at all levels within each school are also doing their best to compete, demonstrating the education sector's active participation in the disaster relief movement. The Education Group's fundraising committee is currently rushing to produce 50,000 "Le Shan" badges to meet the urgent needs of the schools. Furthermore, individuals from all walks of life are also enthusiastically donating directly to the Shanghai Bank to receive "Le Shan" badges.</p>
<p>Shanghai Women's Primary School Enthusiastically Donates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Primary School, attached to the Shanghai Women's High School on Xin Da Gu Road in this city, has always strongly supported various charitable causes. Whether it is the frugality donation or the refugee relief funds, the school has always done its best to raise funds. Now that the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Education Group is raising funds for refugee productive education expenses, the students of the school, upon hearing this, have once again competed to donate. It is reported that as of yesterday, they had raised 360 yuan in national currency. Among them, Xie Bao Lin of the fourth grade donated the most (20 yuan), followed by Liu Bao Ling of the fifth grade (15 yuan), Shen Ming Lin of the sixth grade (14 yuan), Yi Lian Ping of the fifth grade (12 yuan), and Xu Rui Xing of the first grade in the spring (10 yuan). For elementary school students to be so generous is truly commendable.</p>

<p>Preparing for Agricultural and Industrial Schools</p>
<p>Agricultural and industrial vocational education in Sichuan Province had already achieved some scale before the war. Since the relocation of the National Government to Chongqing, talent has concentrated, and in the universities, the agricultural and industrial colleges of National Central University and National Sichuan University are dedicated to agricultural and industrial vocational education. It is learned that after the establishment of Xikang Province, in response to practical needs, agricultural and industrial vocational education is highly valued. Preparations are now underway to establish agricultural and industrial schools.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Zhejiang University</p>
<p>299 Students Arrived at the School</p>
<p>(Yishan Correspondence) National Zhejiang University, since moving to Yishan last autumn, began classes on November 1st. It has now been more than three months. Freshmen, due to insufficient housing and delayed construction, did not begin classes until January 1st of this year. Everything within the school is progressing gradually. This year, the school has hired many additional teachers. To actively promote the tutor system, Lei Peihong has been specially appointed as a tutor, and Meng Xiancheng as the chief tutor of the Normal College, concurrently serving as the head of the Department of Education in the college. Wang Zazhi serves as the head of the Department of Physics and Chemistry in the college. The heads of the original departments of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences concurrently serve in the other departments of the Normal College. The Department of Chinese Literature was also established only last summer, with Professor Guo Binhe of the Department of Foreign Languages reassigned as the department head, and Liu, Yongji, and Miao Yue were newly appointed as professors, and Zhang Qingchang as a lecturer.

<p>Shanghai Education Sector: Opinions on Education Reform</p>
<h3>Some Opinions on the Reform of Secondary Education After the War (II) by Zhang Wenchang</h3>
<p>Secondly, due to the inevitable economic difficulties faced by most parents, in addition to reducing fees and increasing the number of public-funded, free, and work-study positions, it is also possible to implement a semester system that divides the year into four seasons. Except for the six-week summer season for remedial studies, the remaining autumn, winter, and spring seasons each consist of fourteen weeks. Based on my experience in running a short-term experimental class at the East China United Middle School from May to July last year, fourteen weeks are sufficient to complete the academic program of a regular semester. The current circular curriculum of six years in senior and junior high school is wasteful and repetitive. For example, there is a lot of repetition in the teaching materials of history, geography, science, arithmetic, and Chinese. If it can be reorganized, going from shallow to deep, eliminating the complicated and adopting the essential, adding contemporary materials, and allocating the material for a 20-week semester into 14 weeks, focusing on practice, application, and experimentation, then the gains will not lead to the drawbacks of rote memorization. In previous years, some key figures in the National Government proposed abolishing vacations and shortening the length of the academic year. The Ministry of Education ordered a small number of middle schools to experiment with completing six years of middle school in five years. Now, shortening the years of study aligns with the common desire. It is appropriate to use a semester system instead of a term system in post-war China, where funding is limited and the demand for talent is urgent, so that six years of middle school can be completed in four years. If there are a few with lower proficiency, repeating a grade would only be for one semester, which is also very economical in terms of time. If there are one or two subjects failed, remedial lessons could be taken in the summer and re-examined.</p>
<p>Thirdly, vocational education is more necessary due to the urgent need for construction. Therefore, in addition to the vocational departments in higher education, secondary schools also need to train a large number of lower-level cadres in the vocational world. However, it is very difficult to achieve satisfactory facilities and teachers in vocational schools. This point can be remedied by using a work-study system. Utilizing the equipment and technicians of factories, farms, and hospitals can solve the difficulties of equipment and teachers. Factories that obtain these apprentice-style students will be more satisfied and familiar when recruiting them as staff in the future. Schools can still have ordinary foundational subjects and vocational theory subjects to connect theory with practice. Advanced students can receive some wages or benefits to offset living expenses, thereby reducing the burden on parents. The length of this type of school can be slightly longer, but practical experience can be greatly increased. After graduation, there will not be no other options besides pursuing further education. Fourthly, the effectiveness of basic tool subjects such as Chinese, English, and arithmetic in today's secondary schools is very low. The reason is that the goals are complex, the materials are too difficult, and there is too little practice, resulting in a downward trend. Apart from the selection of teaching materials, the lack of self-study time and the inappropriateness of guidance, or even the absence of guidance, are also reasons. For example, the current half-day system. The way to remedy this is to implement strict and precise self-study tutoring. There are two methods. One is to concentrate half a day on tutoring (the other half day for classes), scheduling self-study time for major subjects, with subject teachers rotating in grades and groups to provide guidance, answer questions, assign exercises, practice answering questions, and so on. High-achieving students can also be assigned to each group as group leaders to answer easier questions. In this way, the number of failing students can be reduced, and they can become more proficient and deepen their understanding. The other is to conduct subject-based self-study within the class, with the original teacher providing guidance on the originally assigned assignments. The class time can be slightly longer, divided into two shorter sessions. In the upper session, there is class; in the lower session, there is self-study, such as 40 minutes or 30 minutes each. If there are many subjects and there is not enough time to allocate, major subjects can be selected, or even implemented one or two days a week. In a 50-minute session, 30 to 35 minutes can be used for class, and the remaining 20 minutes or a quarter of an hour can be used for selected self-study guidance so that the main difficulties have already been resolved under the guidance of the original teacher. Then, students will not find self-study as difficult as before.</p>
<p>Fifthly, secondary schools should not be concentrated solely in urban areas. They should also be popularized in rural towns and counties so that secondary students do not have to travel far from home. At the same time, schools should be familiar with the rural social situation and be able to adapt. Sending secondary schools to the countryside is an inevitable path after the war, so that China's lifeblood can be planted in every village. However, there is one difficulty: there are few students because Chinese villages are small and elementary education has not yet been popularized. Therefore, when initially establishing schools, it is appropriate to select villages or county towns in more densely populated locations with a suitable location. If there are not many students, a multi-grade system in the same year or a multi-year system can be used. However, the number of groups should not exceed two, so that two different levels can be guided by experienced teachers without wasting time. Questioning and self-study can be carried out simultaneously. Moreover, if this system is implemented, it is still possible to recruit spring semester students and conduct multi-grade teaching, so that no difficulties will arise due to a small number of people.</p>
<p>Finally, we must know that the key to implementing the above reforms lies in the selection of teachers. In the future, Chinese education lies not in changing the system and academic system, but in the training and retention of teachers. The Ministry of Education recently established normal colleges, providing five years of training. In addition to general and basic education courses, special emphasis is placed on subject and professional training, which is indeed a good strategy. Personality training is carried out through the tutor system, so the improvement of secondary education can be expected. However, the success of this type of talent training will take several years, and it may not be immediately popularized. Therefore, in the next five to ten years, in-service teacher training is also very important. It is generally observed that in-service teachers are not very enthusiastic about further education. The desire for progress and knowledge is one reason, but being constrained by family affairs and finances is also a major reason. Therefore, a salary equivalent to one-half or one-third of the salary of one teacher should be added to the natural school budget so that one teacher each year, every two years, or every three years can rotate to attend a further education class at the normal college for one year. During the leave period, the original salary will still be received, so that teachers will have no worries about the future, and their academic progress will certainly be more effective. What do education and youth administrators think about this? (End)</p>
<p>Puppet Regime Uses Calls for Submissions to Recruit Party Members, Attracting Unemployed Youth into the Trap</p>
<p>Hoping All Sectors Will Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>The number of unemployed youth in Shanghai after the war is very large. Although they live in extreme hardship, they remain steadfast in their aspirations, either relying on submissions to survive or seeking employment through various means in newspapers. Unexpectedly, the puppet organization is taking advantage of this opportunity to carry out evil schemes, using the name of publications to place advertisements in newspapers, soliciting submissions, or using the name of companies and businesses to recruit translators and document writers. The contact addresses are borrowed post office boxes or locations on roads built beyond the border. Unemployed youth, seeing this, believe that the opportunity to make a living has arrived and try one after another. In fact, those in charge are all members of the puppet organization, using this to recruit youth. If the applicants are unaware, they will use malicious plans, sending personnel to make contact, enticing them with sweet words and promises of gain, or threatening and deceiving them, stopping at nothing. The "China and Japan" monthly magazine and certain companies are recent examples. It is deeply hoped that unemployed youth will pay close attention and not fall into their trap.

<p>Hu Dong Public Association Advocates Establishing</p>
<p>Free Night Schools for Apprentices</p>
<p>Four Schools Will Be Established This Spring</p>
<p>Apprentices Can Attend School for Free</p>
<p>The Hu Dong Public Association of Shanghai University is a well-known social service organization in this city. Since its establishment, it has made unique contributions to the welfare of workers and has been praised by the national social work and social work community. After the "August 13th" Incident last year, the association's Yangshupu location was located in the war zone. Under the leadership of Director Dr. Jin Wuzhou, it continued to operate various social services in the city center of the public concession. In the past year, it has opened Hu Dong Primary and Secondary School, Automotive School, Radio School, and refugee shelters, all of which have achieved results. Recently, in order to improve business and promote the lives of apprentices, the association has raised funds to advocate for the establishment of free night schools for apprentices, enrolling apprentices from shops and small factories for free schooling. It is reported that the association held an Apprentice Labor Education Committee meeting on the evening of February 10th to discuss the direction of apprentice schools. Chen Heqin, Lu Gaoyi, Lin Zhuoran, Gu Zuo Ren, Zhu Yu Bao, Lu Yue Zhang, Chen Leng Seng, etc., attended the meeting. As a result, it was resolved to first pilot four schools this spring, which will be set up in the bustling urban areas of Shanghai. If there is an increased need in the future, more will be added. Director Dr. Jin Wuzhou of the association also recently hosted reporters from major newspapers.</p>

<h3>Li Huitang Scores Three Goals Out of Three Shots; Hong Kong Football Team Defeats Philippine Team; Manila Suffers a Miserable Defeat of Four to One; Bowser Is Not as Good as King Li</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The first inter-city football match between Hong Kong and Manila, which has never happened before, took place on the afternoon of the 18th at the Navy Stadium. As a result, the Hong Kong team won a crushing victory of four to one. The Philippines suffered a miserable defeat. The stands were packed with an estimated seven or eight thousand spectators.</p>
<p>Philippines Not as Good as Hong Kong</p>
<p>If the Hong Kong team's forwards could have fully utilized all their excellent opportunities, the scoring record would have been more than just that. The performance of the two inside forwards and the defense line was the best. The two wingers, Hou Chengtao and Fu La, were completely overshadowed. Although Fu La scored the fourth goal, the number of shots he missed was countless. The Manila players, although very agile, were far inferior in their ball control and strategy. The left inside forward, Bowser, was the soul of the entire Philippine team, providing the team's forward line with extremely accurate ball supply. However, Bowser was unable to accomplish anything alone, and the Philippine forwards' efforts were in vain, as Li Tiansheng and Shi Han calmly swept the ball away. The Philippine team adopted the third defender method, with central defender Yao Jidi often retreating to defend. As a result, the heavy responsibility of commanding the front line of the central army was concentrated on Bowser alone. However, since the Hong Kong team's central defense line was exceptionally strong, coupled with Feng Jingxiang and Dagao Shannu on the left and right for support, the entire army's advancing force was extremely formidable. For most of the time, the ball revolved in front of the Philippine team's goal. This midfield advantage was also one of the points where the Philippines was not as good as Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Ball King Iron Leg</p>
<p>Li Huitang, the Hong Kong team's captain and center forward, was the target of the forwards' passes. The ball king's leg is sure to score with one shot. Indeed, all three of Hong Kong's goals were scored by the ball king's iron leg. The power of his first and third shots was truly formidable, both being powerful shots from outside 20 yards. The second goal was scored with a pass from Dagao Shannu. At that time, the Philippine team had only the goalkeeper to support the army alone. Li scored with one shot. Among the forwards, in addition to Li, Feng Jingxiang and Dagao Shannu were also great contributors, working hard to create all kinds of opportunities for the center forward. Dagao Shannu, in particular, was excellent in both offense and defense, running around the field and being extremely active. The three outstanding players in the central line, Dickson, sat in the central plains, with Liang Rongzhao and Han Niweilu assisting on the left and right. Li Tiansheng and Shi Han's defense was even like an iron wall. Therefore, although Tan Jun Gan conceded a goal, there was almost no door to defend, and business was cold and desolate, only getting a few shots.</p>
<p>Opportunity is a Pity</p>
<p>Hong Kong missed countless opportunities, which is regrettable. In the first five minutes of the game, Fu La had an excellent opportunity, but he shot the ball against the crossbar. Hou Chengtao was only five yards away from the goal, but he also shot the ball wide. The poor quality of his shots was unprecedented. Feng Jingxiang was too cautious, passing the ball to Huitang as soon as he got it. Even in the extremely good position for himself to shoot, he would definitely pass it to Big Brother Li. Because Huitang was under severe surveillance by the opponent, some good opportunities were also wasted due to Jingxiang's excessive caution. Philippine central defender Yao Jidi was responsible for guarding Li Huitang, never leaving his side. When the Hong Kong side attacked, he retreated to the third defender position. However, Huitang saw through his trick and did not follow him. As a result, Yao Jidi often had no one to guard. Left winger Wallace was very good, making Hong Kong winger Fu La less active. The two defenders, Miranda and Bakhigo, were very fast, but they lacked calmness in tense moments. Goalkeeper Yao Oer was unable to save the first three goals. The fourth goal by Fu La was gained and then lost again.</p>
<p>Huitang's Three Arrows</p>
<p>Within the first five minutes of the kickoff, the Hong Kong team took the offensive. Then, they went back and forth, with the Hong Kong side showing a clear advantage. Then, the Hong Kong team advanced and got a corner kick. Hou Chengtao kicked the ball, and the ball happened to fall in front of the goal. Li Huitang kicked the ball and it went into the net. The Hong Kong team continued to attack, but although there were some opportunities, no further progress was made. The first half ended with a score of one to zero. Only one minute after the start of the second half, Dagao Shannu intercepted the ball from Nietu's feet and passed it to Li Huitang, who approached the goal and scored again, making it two to zero. The Philippine team counterattacked fiercely. Two minutes later, right winger Reyes did regain a goal, chasing to two to one. Half of the second half had passed, and Li Huitang scored the third goal. This goal was shot with his left foot and was unparalleled. Since the Hong Kong team had a clear advantage, the competition gradually became relaxed. A few minutes before the end of the game, Fu La shot the final fourth goal from a difficult angle.</p>

<h3>Relocation of Nanhui and Chuansha County Governments Completed - Urgency of Warplanes in Pudong - Japanese Military Works in Xinchang Completely Destroyed - Various Guerrilla Detachments Successfully Established Contact</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops in Pudong, after suffering successive defeats, have dispatched two or three warplanes daily to intimidate and scout. The defeat at Xinchang Town on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year was particularly severe, resulting in casualties for the guerrillas as well. Although the Japanese resisted stubbornly on the Wang family's watchtower, setting up electric fences and fighting fiercely all night, they were eventually forced to retreat after the guerrillas completely destroyed their fortifications. Afterwards, the Japanese targeted Datuan Town in Nanhui County, and the commanders of the various guerrilla detachments are now planning to fully drive out the remaining Japanese troops who have invaded the border region of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. However, during the general offensive, it is evident that the Japanese will resort to any means to harm the rear, and even use the pretext of the county government's involvement to harm non-combatant civilians. Therefore, it was decided to relocate the Nanhui County government to an inconspicuous location that is inaccessible to outsiders. The relocation of all departments was completed the day before yesterday, and the Chuansha County government has also been moved away from Heqing Town, ensuring that collaborators cannot provide guidance and Japanese warplanes cannot carry out their schemes. It is now reported that the guerrillas in Pudong have successfully established contact, and a major battle is expected to begin around the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>Sudden Tension Along the Shangnan Line</p>
<p>The situation in the Shangnan Railway area of Pudong is tense, with frequent troop movements by the Japanese. Several batches, each consisting of three or four hundred soldiers, have been dispatched successively in the past few days. Most of them were transferred to the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to fight, while a small number were deployed to reinforce the western suburbs, leaving the defenses vulnerable. The day before yesterday, around 4 PM, over a hundred army soldiers were transferred back from the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, landed at Nanmatou, and rushed to Zhoupu Town, the terminus of the Shangnan Road, to station there. During the landing of these Japanese troops, the Nanmatou area was temporarily placed under martial law for half an hour. It was also learned that the Shangnan Railway, after having its tracks sabotaged in several sections by Chinese forces taking advantage of the situation, was not repaired until the afternoon of the 28th. Although the Shangnan passenger train service has resumed, Japanese troops, accompanied by puppet soldiers, are searching civilian houses in the Dongsanlintang area, causing disturbances to innocent villagers.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Troops Hold Important Meeting</p>
<p>Since the areas of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties in Pudong were brought under the control of our guerrilla forces, the Japanese and puppet forces have been unable to operate freely, only constructing fortresses in various strategic locations and stationing troops to guard them in order to prevent attacks by our guerrilla forces. In order to support the long-term resistance war, our guerrilla forces, which are lurking in various locations, held an important meeting at the Taili Bridge in Fengxian County last month. The guerrilla leaders who participated in the meeting included Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, Yu Taosheng, Qin Xingyan, Zhang Huifang, and Zhang Miaogen, numbering in the dozens. The important resolutions made were: (1) To establish a general command of the guerrilla forces in the eight counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Shangjin, Qingbao, and Jiading, with Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, and Yu Taosheng serving as the general and deputy commanders, respectively; (2) To mobilize troops to launch a general offensive against the Japanese troops on a specific date; (3) To organize civilian intelligence teams to infiltrate enemy-controlled areas and gather information on Japanese troop movements; (4) To mobilize the people of the eight counties to defend Chinese land with local armed forces; (5) To abolish exorbitant taxes and levies to alleviate commercial difficulties; (6) To organize mobile theater troupes to perform anti-Japanese dramas; (7) To request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to select cadres to go to the countryside and organize county governments. After the meeting, the guerrilla leaders returned to their respective defense areas.</p>
<p>Military Affairs Commission Issues Order</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Gambling</p>
<p>Violators Will Be Punished for Obstructing the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, recognizing that gambling wastes time and hinders work, and that such activities should not be tolerated during this time of war, has issued an order to all provinces to strictly prohibit it. The order is recorded below: "This war of resistance is a crucial moment for the survival of our nation. To defeat the brutal enemy and achieve victory, we must rely on the loyalty and courage of the entire country. All personnel at all levels of the Party, government, and military should be vigilant and diligent, eliminate bad habits, and devote all their abilities to public service, setting an example for the people. Those who continue to indulge in idleness and licentiousness will not only degrade themselves and dishonor their official duties but also betray the Party and the nation. From now on, all gambling is strictly prohibited. Those who dare to violate this order, once discovered and apprehended, will be punished under military law for obstructing the war of resistance without leniency. In addition to ordering all national police agencies to conduct strict investigations, we also issue this earnest warning, urging immediate compliance and instructing all subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Bomb Explosion on Jiangwan Road Kills Four Japanese - Two Others Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Japanese-language Tairiku Nippo reported today (the 2nd) that the Quantai Woodworks factory on Dongjiangwan Road, a quarter of a mile behind the International Settlement's rifle range, has been destroyed by artillery fire. Buried in the rubble was an unidentified bomb, which exploded on Wednesday (the 1st) afternoon.</p>
<p>Four Japanese Killed</p>
<p>Four people were killed and two seriously injured, including four adults and two children. They were touring the Jiangwan battlefield when they stopped at the former factory. A 15-year-old boy named Ishikawa Hiroshi picked up the explosive device to examine it, and when it fell to the ground, it detonated in a terrifying explosion. A passerby saw a thick black cloud of smoke rising from the ruined factory and ran to the scene, witnessing a</p>
<p>Horrific Scene</p>
<p>One person was already dead, and the other five were wounded, lying on the ground groaning. Soldiers from the Japanese Naval Landing Force were notified and rushed the injured to Fumin Hospital in ambulances. Three of them died immediately upon arrival. Those who died were identified as Shichiku Saio, Shichiku Tetsushi, Matsubara Shoichi, and Ishikawa Hiroshi, all residing at No. 38, Fengle Lane. The injured were Sato Satoru and Matsubara Shoichi's daughter. Sato</p>
<p>Recently Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>An investigation into the nature of the explosive device began today. It is reported to have been a 3 cm diameter, 10 cm long device. It is believed to be either an old artillery shell or a hand grenade. The Japanese Consulate Police Department has notified the public to be aware of the dangers in the area surrounding the explosion site.</p>
<h3>Following a Series of Bombings, the Settlement is Under Strict Guard - Observers Suspect Organized Activity - Police Carefully Examining Retrieved Shrapnel</h3>
<p>Following four consecutive bombings in the busy Nanjing Road area of the International Settlement the night before last, the police authorities are taking the matter very seriously for the sake of security within the Settlement. They are currently conducting a thorough investigation and have stepped up security measures to prevent the recurrence of similar unfortunate incidents. According to sources, these acts of violence appear to be organized with the intention of disrupting security within the Settlement and exploiting the situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Observations on the Purpose of the Violence</p>
<p>Observations from various sources regarding the bombing incidents on Nanjing Road and elsewhere are as follows: (1) Since the outbreak of a series of "terrorist incidents" in the International Settlement at the end of last month, the authorities have actively strengthened preventive measures to maintain security, including blocking alleys and inspecting pedestrians and vehicles, as necessary police measures. It is unlikely that any misguided patriots would engage in terrorist acts under such tight security. (2) The repeated "terrorist incidents" have been purposeful and targeted, and they would not indiscriminately throw bombs in busy urban areas, harming innocent people. (3) The bombing incidents on the evening of March 1st involved as many as four separate explosions, occurring consecutively within an hour from 9:27 PM to 10:30 PM. It is clear that the intention was to disrupt security within the Settlement, and it can be inferred that these acts of violence were organized. The clues are not difficult to unravel.</p>
<p>Settlement Authorities Conducting Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Since the bombing incidents occurred on Nanjing Road, Yinghua Street, Yuqiaqing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc. on the evening of March 1st, although the Settlement authorities have not yet apprehended any suspects related to the case, they are taking this violence very seriously. It is now learned that the police from various jurisdictions are carefully examining the retrieved shrapnel and various documents related to the case. Meanwhile, detectives have been secretly deployed to various important areas and venues to closely observe the activities of various individuals. Regarding defense, plainclothes detectives have been stationed in all public venues since 1 PM yesterday to pay attention to the movements of all individuals. Strict security measures have been implemented on busy roads in the evenings. The police stations in the French Concession have also deployed detectives to key roads and stations since yesterday to inspect pedestrians and passengers, in order to prevent undesirable elements from entering the Concession.</p>
<p>Areas with Dance Halls Are Under Special Attention</p>
<p>Following the consecutive bombing incidents on Nanjing Road in the International Settlement the night before last, security was further strengthened yesterday. Detectives were stationed near the New Asia Restaurant and Guanshengyuan Food Company, and Japanese detectives stood guard in front of the entrances. All locations where bombs exploded, such as the Great World, Cathay, Great Eastern, East Asia, and Ciro's, are dance halls. As a result, the police have issued special warnings to dance halls. On the night of the incidents, the police ordered all nearby dance halls to close by midnight. However, it remains to be seen whether the many dance halls that operate all night on Saturdays will be banned from doing so in the future.</p>
<p>Japanese Comments Reported in Western Press</p>
<p>According to the Tairiku Nippo, representatives from the Japanese Army, Navy, and Consulate Police Department visited the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities again yesterday (the 1st) shortly after 10 AM. They were received by Police Commissioner Bourne, Deputy Police Commissioner Smith, and Gilbert. The meeting lasted for three hours, and the Japanese representatives left the Council at 1 PM. While it is understood that the discussion focused on the actions of terrorists within the International Settlement and the current security measures taken by the police, no statement regarding the purpose of the Japanese representatives' visit was issued yesterday. Japanese officials did not announce the details of the meeting when hosting foreign journalists last night. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said, "We can only say that they exchanged views on the police administration of the International Settlement." The spokesman also did not know whether the discussions included the police administration of areas outside the Settlement and in the puppet government's controlled areas.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked</p>
<p>whether Police Commissioner Bourne had reached an agreement with the Japanese authorities, the spokesman replied, "This is not a question of agreement, only an exchange of views." When a reporter asked whether the French Concession had exchanged views with the Japanese authorities regarding the terrorist incidents, the spokesman replied, "There was no discussion of police administration in the French Concession." The spokesman announced in response to a reporter's request a few days ago that, from January 1st to February 22nd of this year, the Shanghai Japanese Consulate Police Department had recorded</p>
<p>Political Terrorist Cases</p>
<p>57 cases. According to information obtained by the spokesman, 49 of these cases were directed against Chinese and 8 against Japanese. Among the cases of attacks on Chinese, 36 occurred in the International Settlement, 8 outside the International Settlement, and 5 in the French Concession. Regarding terrorist attempts against Japanese, there were 4 cases inside and outside the International Settlement. When a reporter asked whether these cases were</p>
<p>All Political</p>
<p>acts of terrorism, the Embassy spokesman replied, "My information is as stated above." He was also asked whether he was sure that the alleged acts of terrorism within the International Settlement all occurred within the Settlement, or whether some terrorist cases occurred in the lanes and streets outside the Settlement under the control of the puppet government. The spokesman replied that he was quite busy and did not have time to investigate. He then said that, according to the information he had obtained, there were 36</p>
<p>Attacks Against Chinese</p>
<p>and 4 attacks against Japanese during the aforementioned period, all of which occurred within the area under the jurisdiction of the International Settlement police. When a reporter mentioned news from Nanjing recently released by the Tong Meng News Agency, Nanjing claimed that there had been 100 terrorist cases against members of the "Reformed Government" since the Japanese occupied the area. If so, would more than 50 of them have occurred in the puppet-controlled area? The spokesman replied that he was not aware of this information and needed to obtain more detailed information before discussing the matter.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Must Re-Register - Shanghai-Taiwan Route Approved to Resume - Ships Not Allowed to Leave Port Without Paying Public Welfare Fee - Japanese Warships Shell Zhenhai, Minor Damage to the Chinese Side</h3>
<p>The situation near Haimen in Zhejiang Province has been unusually peaceful recently. Resumption of the Shanghai-Taiwan shipping route is anticipated. However, for strict security purposes, the military authorities require all foreign ships operating in the area to re-register. Shipping companies have complied with the order. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has telegraphed the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command, instructing them not to allow foreign ships that have not paid the public welfare fee to leave port. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Japanese warships shelled Zhenhai on the 27th of last month. The Modern News Agency reporter has provided the following details regarding the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Taiwan Route Ships Must Re-Register</p>
<p>The original foreign merchant ships operating on the Haimen shipping route in Zhejiang Province included five ships from companies such as Jardine Matheson, San Tai, Harna, Golden, and Haifuk, which regularly sailed the route. On the 17th of last month, due to Japanese claims of taking military action, all ships were notified to leave the area. Starting on the 18th, four Japanese warships twice shelled the area, creating disturbances. After the local garrison fought back valiantly and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese warships, the Japanese warships left. However, they sank sand and stone barges at the mouth of the Jiaojiang River, attempting to blockade the area. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the situation in Haimen has been peaceful recently. The authorities, in response to requests from foreign merchants, are preparing to allow the ships to resume operations. However, for strict security purposes, the Commander of the Xth Army Group has ordered Commissioner Xing to instruct all foreign ships originally operating on the route to re-register. The American merchant shipping companies in Shanghai, such as China Merchants, have received telegrams from their Haimen branches and have decided to comply with the re-registration procedures in order to resume shipping on the route and avoid suffering further business losses.</p>
<p>Ships Must Pay Fee to Leave Port</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously stipulated that foreign ships operating on routes in eastern Zhejiang must pay a public welfare fee of 20% of their tonnage in order to raise funds for local development projects. Notices were sent to local shipping associations, instructing shipping companies to comply. It has been learned that the fee has been collected starting on the 25th of last month and the 1st of this month. The Ningbo Shipping Association received a letter yesterday from Inspector Yu of the Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the Provincial Department of Finance had telegraphed instructions that ships are required to present receipts for payment of the public welfare fee before being allowed to leave port. The Provincial Government has also telegraphed the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo Defense Commands, instructing them to comply with the order. All ships should not leave port without paying the public welfare fee to avoid being detained. After receiving the letter, the association immediately sent notices to all shipping companies, instructing them to comply.</p>
<p>Details of Japanese Warships Shelling Zhenhai</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM on the 27th of last month, three Japanese warships were spotted in the waters of Qilishiyu, outside Zhenhai. They suddenly opened fire on the shore, firing over thirty shells. The Modern News Agency correspondent stationed in Ningbo has investigated and confirmed the following details of the damage: A shell landed in the middle of the Mingtang courtyard at No. 6, Hujia Lane, Xihetang, Zhenhai, shattering three stone slabs and breaking five large vats. The door panels and walls of Jiang Quandong's house were damaged. The glass windows of the Chen and Yu families on either side were shattered. The shell landed in a hole several feet deep. A large piece of shrapnel landed on the house of Xie Yusheng at No. 15, Shaoyajie in the city, piercing the roof and breaking the staircase. A shell landed on Jiangnan Li Quanchang's stockyard street, injuring a duck. Two shells landed in the river in front of the Sanbei Company on Dadaotou. A shell landed on the mudflat in front of the Dongmen Customs. Another four shells landed in the river. A shell landed on the main road of the port, collapsing one room of Li Hengtai's kitchen. A shell landed near the Haiao Temple, Guangfu Temple, Tushan, Huangwaken, Lejiafang's house, Xielingdun, Da'ao Mountain, Houting Mountain, Lejia Ancestral Hall, Qigen mudflat, and Hujiadou. A shell landed on Shaxie Ridge, Qijiashan, destroying a coffin containing a female corpse. The coffin fragments scattered, and the corpse was torn apart, a truly tragic sight. Another shell landed on a stone pier nearby. A shell landed on the Hutantiao Temple in Qingzhi Lake, injuring a cook. A shell landed in a nearby field. A shell landed on Zhushan Tou, and another shell landed in front of Doufang. In this shelling, the Japanese warships mostly used explosives, so they detonated in the air.</p>
<h3>Inland Grain Transported Northward, Shanghai Grain Market Secure, Shanghai Municipal Council Issues Grain Regulation Report</h3>
<p>According to a report on the grain issue recently released by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Joint Rice and Grain Management Committee recently held a meeting to review the situation of the rice market in this port. It is estimated that there are 900,000 piculs of rice currently in the market. 10,000 piculs were shipped to Shanghai in January of this year on average each day. The French Concession currently has 96,000 bags of rice in storage, of which 30,000 bags were added in December of last year and January of this year. Although inland grain has been transported to</p>
<p>Northern Ports</p>
<p>the source of this port is stable and the impact is still small, so there is no need to worry too much about rice. According to the committee's report, at the end of November last year, when the committee held a meeting, the bureau had 10,606 bags of rice in storage. Later, fearing it would become moldy, it was thoroughly inspected and any that showed signs of mold were sold. The bureau currently has 6,156 bags of rice in storage. The Chief of the Finance Department, in view of the above-mentioned market</p>
<p>Rice Storage Situation</p>
<p>found it satisfactory and proposed to sell the rice stored by the bureau immediately. The committee also believed that since there was sufficient rice in the market, the amount stored by the bureau could be considered insignificant, and unanimously approved the Chief's proposal. The Chief also reported on the results of the bureau's purchase of Saigon rice. It was reported that a total of 22,720 tons of rice were purchased, with a profit of 280,000 yuan after sales. In addition, import merchants paid a total of 54,000 yuan. These merchants made a decision at the bureau's meeting to</p>
<p>Stop Purchasing Foreign Rice</p>
<p>after which the bureau provided convenience for them to purchase and transport it themselves, so they paid a certain amount. Regarding how to dispose of the above two sums of money, the Chief of the Finance Department believed that the 54,000 yuan paid by the rice merchants did not represent a loss to the bureau, and proposed to directly allocate it to the bureau's refugee relief fund to supplement the insufficient entertainment tax. As for the profit of 280,000 yuan, it was proposed to allocate it to the bureau's regular budget to offset the bureau's various departments' already and still existing expenditures on</p>
<p>Refugee Relief</p>
<p>expenses, such as refugee shelters, hospitals, water supply facilities, and police services, etc. The two methods proposed by the Chief were unanimously approved by the committee. The committee's report has been approved by the board of directors, and the funds allocated to the regular budget will be allocated immediately to reduce the bureau's refugee relief expenditures. This decision was made as all personnel from various departments of the bureau who participated in the organization and management of the grain mechanism could serve with enthusiasm. The Chief of the Finance Department promised to do his best, and the board of directors and the committee were deeply grateful.</p>

<p>Evacuation Measures</p>
<p>Have Been Negotiated and Decided</p>
<p>Able-bodied Men Cannot Evacuate</p>
<p>Instruction No. 198 of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, No. 198, states that regarding the evacuation of our people to the Philippines, our Consulate General in Manila has negotiated with the local government and obtained limited permission, which was approved by the President of the Philippines on November 29. The measures include the following five items: (1) Relatives and friends of overseas Chinese in the Philippines who wish to continue to reside, and new arrivals who come to the Philippines for refuge, must first fill out three copies of the application guarantee and four photos to the Consulate General, which will be forwarded to the Refugee Review Committee for review. The consulate will then send a letter to the Ministry of Industry for approval based on the committee's report. (2) Able-bodied men (i.e., men aged 18 to 45) and those with chronic diseases, bad habits, or improper behavior cannot enjoy the treatment of refugees. (3) The representative of the refugees must bear full responsibility for supporting the refugees and must be guaranteed by two stores. (4) After passing the Refugee Review Committee, the consulate will affix a receipt ticket issued by the Ministry of National Currency of 10 yuan (equivalent to 6.6 pesos) according to regulations. (5) Anyone who discovers that others are taking advantage of this to swindle and profit from it may submit evidence to the consulate for investigation. The above five points are closely related to our people going to the Philippines. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is issued to inform and notify all people going to the Philippines in the district, this order.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Shaves Head and Becomes a Monk, Once Commanded Operations in China</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Japanese Daily on the 2nd, according to Japanese sources, Japanese General Maki, who previously landed at Jinshanwei, Hangzhou Bay, recently shaved his head and became a monk. However, it is not known what stimulated him to do this.</p>
<p>Money Trade Association</p>
<p>Member General Meeting</p>
<p>February Interest Rate</p>
<p>Market Price is Three Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association held the 41st General Meeting of the Third Session at the association at 2:00 PM yesterday. Forty-one companies including Fuyuan, Shunkang, Fukang, and Huifeng were present, with more than 50 representatives including Yan Dayou and Zhang Mengzhou. Xi Jiming was elected as the chairman, and Ge Huaiqing was the recorder. The situation of the listed money houses after the closing of accounts for the 27th year of the Republic of China was reported. As for the interest rate market from February 23 to February 28, it was decided to be three yuan. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. In addition, after the money houses were listed, they have begun to send in reports to restore credit lending. However, the guarantee system is adopted after the war. It is expected that the submission of these reports will be completed by March 9. The association also scheduled to hold the annual public sacrifice to the late directors of the North Market on March 9.</p>

<h3>Puppet Organization Handles Lawyer "Registration," The Legal Profession Righteously Refuses, Puppet Helplessly Extends Deadline by Three Months, Legal Professionals Resolve to Continue Ignoring It</h3>
<p>Since the puppet "Judicial Administration Department of the Reformed Government" declared its "establishment," in order to control lawyers in the occupied areas, it issued a "notice" last year to handle lawyer "registration" and replace "new certificates" within three months. However, legal professionals, all of whom are intellectuals, are able to understand the greater righteousness and are unwilling to sell their souls. Therefore, except for a few scoundrels, the majority of lawyers unanimously refused. Those who came to Shanghai to practice law in the past joined together. Now, as the deadline is approaching, the puppet "Ministry of Justice" sees that no one has "registered," which is a very sad situation. However, it still tries to continue to lure them, so it recently issued a notice to extend the "registration" deadline by another three months. However, it is understood that legal professionals are determined to adhere to their original intention, ignore it, and never be tempted. It is expected that the "registration" move will ultimately be just a dream.</p>
<p>Li Zhiming</p>
<p>Pudong Battle Achievements</p>
<p>Quickly Recaptures Key Areas in Fierce Battle with Japanese</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Flee in Panic</p>
<p>Pudong guerrilla commander Li Zhiming is active in the Pudong area and has attracted much attention from the public. Recently, Li received orders from his superiors and led the first and fourth battalions, led by Chen Zhiyang, to attack the Japanese military base in Nanqiao on the 22nd of last month. At 12:00 PM that night, Li personally commanded the attack. After several fierce charges, Nanqiao Town was once occupied, and two portable machine guns, two rifles, one Mauser pistol, and one pistol, as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition, were seized. Five Japanese soldiers were killed. However, two squad leaders, Yu Jiaqing and Zhang Fufan, and one squad leader of Li's unit were also wounded and died on the spot. However, after the Japanese troops retreated from Nanqiao, they were unwilling to give up. At 5:00 AM the next morning, they drew reinforcements from Minhang and launched a counterattack on Nanqiao with heavy weapons. Li, believing that the mission had been accomplished and unwilling to make unnecessary sacrifices, led his troops to withdraw from the town. On the 25th, Li was ordered again to lead the second battalion, led by Zhang Sigong, to join the fourth detachment's Chief of Staff Bai, and lead Gu Shouxin's troops to attack Xinchang that night. The sound of gunfire was like a string of pearls, and the fierce charge was due to Bai's leading by example and commanding effectively. The Japanese troops were unable to resist until 5:00 AM the next morning and retreated completely towards Xiansha, suffering heavy losses. At that time, Zhang and Gu's troops immediately stationed in Xinchang Town and restored order. The national flag flew all over the town, and the people cheered. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM, the Japanese troops dispatched a large number of reinforcements and launched a counterattack on the town. The artillery fire was exceptionally fierce, and many houses in the city were destroyed. However, Zhang and Gu's troops still resisted calmly, dividing the entire town into the southeast sections. As a result, the eastern section was occupied by the Japanese troops, while the southern section remained in the hands of the Chinese troops. As of now, the two sides are still facing each other across the bridge.</p>
<p>Welsh People in England Celebrate Festival</p>
<p>Offer Wreaths Before the God of Peace</p>
<p>And Hold Dance Parties</p>
<p>The China Press reported that the Welsh people in England, scattered around the world, celebrated St. David's Day yesterday (the 1st). Although there are not many Welsh expatriates in Shanghai, they also celebrated it in a big way yesterday. They went to the God of Peace in the morning to hold the annual wreath-offering ceremony. Then, the Shanghai St. David's Association hosted the annual St. David's Day dance party at the French Fencing Association. More than 200 people attended, and the British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, also attended, making it very lively. It ended late at night.</p>
<p>Inland Silk Factories</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai to Set Up Factories One After Another</p>
<p>Five or Six New Ones Established</p>
<p>After the silk factories in the Chinese-controlled areas of Shanghai and the guerrilla areas in the interior were closed due to the impact of the war, they have been rushing to relocate and resume work in the areas beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement. More than 40 have been established one after another in the past year. As the silk market is active in foreign markets, the factories are rushing to ship goods. Therefore, most of the silk factories in Shanghai's West had profits last year. Since the beginning of this year, inland manufacturers have seen that the sales of silk are still strong, and they all intend to set up factories and workshops in Shanghai's West. It is reported that in the areas beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement, there have been five or six new silk factories established so far this year, all of which are actively preparing to start work in the near future. The number of newly built factories in the Shanghai's West area has suddenly increased, and the market is gradually becoming lively.</p>
<p>Japanese Cigarettes</p>
<p>Poor Quality and Difficult to Sell</p>
<p>Even the Japanese Don't Smoke Them</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 1st), the Japanese-language Continental New Daily reported that the Japanese tobacco industry has failed to keep pace with other Japanese businesses that have entered central China along with the Japanese army. Japanese merchants operating tobacco in this port have expressed regret over this development. This phenomenon is due to the poor quality of the tobacco itself and the</p>
<p>Packaging of cigarette boxes and cans is not attractive. Even the people in the Japanese-occupied areas, including the Japanese expatriates in Hongkou, would rather give up Japanese-made cigarettes and smoke foreign brand cigarettes with better quality. Only a very small number of smokers buy Japanese cigarettes. The Japanese army and navy consume nine-tenths of the Japanese cigarettes in this port, and the rest are bought by civilian smokers. Although Japanese cigarettes are cheap, they still cannot gain an advantage, because</p>
<p>Coolies and rickshaw pullers are willing to smoke Chinese-made cigarettes. Those Japanese who are accustomed to smoking foreign cigarettes do not follow the urging of their patriotic compatriots to buy domestic products in terms of cigarettes. Those who can buy better cigarettes at the same low price and still want to buy Japanese cigarettes have rare taste.</p>
<p>Postal Remittance Bureau Increases Remittance Amount to Shanghai</p>
<p>From 500 Yuan to 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Parcels on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Line Resume</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau previously stipulated that the amount of money remitted from postal offices of all sizes in all cities to Shanghai was limited to 500 yuan per person per day. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the bureau yesterday that the bureau, in order to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants, has increased the amount of money remitted from other places to Shanghai to a limit of 1,000 yuan per person per day, so as to facilitate merchants. It was also learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration has also resumed accepting large parcels destined for all cities and towns along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Beihai to Kunming, with a limit of 20 kilograms per item. Detailed regulations are in place for the charge per kilogram.</p>
<p>Puppet "Municipal Government" Forcibly Registers White Russians</p>
<p>Most White Russians Are Unwilling</p>
<p>Registration Period Will Be Extended</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 1st), it was learned that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" under Japanese protection has again agreed to extend the registration period for White Russian immigrants. The new deadline is roughly set for March 15. Today (the 2nd), it can be confirmed. The registration period was originally scheduled to end on February 15. Because only a small number of White Russians in this port went to register, the deadline was extended to March 1. However, as of February 28, there were still many White Russians</p>
<p>Did Not Register</p>
<p>The White Russian Immigration Committee then applied for another extension, which has been approved. However, the length of the extension has not yet been officially announced. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" announced yesterday that it will soon announce its attitude towards White Russian immigrants who still hold expired passports from the Central Government. This issue is currently under consideration by the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing, and a decision will be announced here soon. Although White Russian immigrants generally oppose registering with the puppet regime, those who do not register will not be allowed to travel in areas controlled by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs Exports in January: Tax-Exempt Goods Worth 19 Million, Exceeding Taxable Goods by Nearly Double</h3>

<h3>The Prospect of Far Eastern Finance in the Sino-Japanese War (Part 1): Chinese Finance Remains Stable Due to Sophisticated Management, Japanese Yen Devalues Due to the Impact of the War, Speech by the Chairman of the HSBC Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>HSBC, a British bank, is a foreign bank with financial authority in the Far East and has a deep relationship with Chinese finance and trade. At its annual meeting held in Hong Kong, Chairman Pearce gave a detailed account of Far Eastern finance and commerce during the Sino-Japanese War, based on various investigations. Its content has important observations and conclusions on China's financial finance, the daily devaluation of the Japanese yen, and the future trends of finance and trade in the Far East. The following is the original speech by Pearce found by a reporter from the New Sound Society.</p>
<p>More Than 10 Million Yuan in Profits Last Year</p>
<p>Dear Shareholders, the balance sheet for the past year has been circulated separately. I would now like to briefly read it again. After making significant losses and provisions, the net profit for the past year was 15,296,621 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. If this number is added to the 3,383,004 yuan, 5 jiao and 3 fen carried forward from the previous year, after calculating at 1 shilling, 2 pence and 7/8, paying an interim dividend of 400,000 pounds, and paying directors' remuneration, the remaining amount available for distribution is 12,145,172 yuan and 0.08 fen. The following distribution method is now proposed: distribute a dividend of 3 pounds per share (after deducting income tax), totaling 7,744,537 yuan, 8 jiao and 2 fen, transfer 1 million yuan to the bank building item, and carry forward 3,400,634 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen to the new account item, totaling 12,145,172 yuan and 0.08 fen. The calculations of the items on the balance sheet are based on the calculation rate of last year, which is 1 shilling, 2 pence and 7/8 per Hong Kong dollar. As for the liabilities in the balance sheet, both the liabilities and assets must increase by 20 million yuan. The term deposit account has increased by 11 million yuan. As for the assets, the cash item has increased by 42 million yuan, the investment item has increased by 30 million yuan, the loan item has decreased by 13 million yuan, and the bills receivable item has increased by 46 million yuan.</p>
<p>Unstable Situation Affects Finance</p>
<p>Over the years, the chairman of the conference has given a detailed analysis of the political, financial, and commercial situation in the Far East in his speech. In a year when the political situation is so difficult and the financial and commercial situation is so abnormal, although I will elaborate on these topics, I will only discuss them in general terms. I have not had time to mention or elaborate on the matters that you hope to be rigorously reviewed or explained in detail. I believe that you will be disappointed by this. Given my position, if I were to speak in detail about the current entangled and difficult political matters, I know that you would also consider this to be unwise. We are not involved in any government's secrets. The more we say, the easier it is to cause misunderstandings. Our balance sheet shows that although we have encountered many difficulties, we are still making unique progress. The optimism expressed by the chairman last year has also proved to be reasonable. However, those of us who have significant commercial interests here know that if the two major neighboring countries in the East are hostile to each other, the financial and economic situation will not be stable for a day and will change constantly. The current dispute is also causing dissatisfaction with the "open door" and even the maintenance of British rights and interests in China. Some people are deeply resentful of our British government for not taking strong and effective steps in the Far East and Europe. However, I do not intend to criticize our British diplomatic authorities today.</p>
<p>Hope that Japan will Fulfill its Promises</p>
<p>In times of international crisis, the freedom of speech and publication should be limited. Lately, I believe that careless criticism, the falsehood of rumors, and the publication of news have caused no small harm to society. I also believe that the recent debate in our England on foreign relations has gone beyond what is necessary. In any case, our British government is now greatly increasing its strength on the one hand, and at the same time seeking to advance world peace, disentangling itself from all entanglements, and being well prepared to deal with future unpredictable situations without the difficulty of being drawn into the vortex. It should also be affirmed that the countries that maintain interests in the Far East have also made their positions clear. Our country's position is completely in accordance with international treaties. Unilateral modifications to treaties or agreements such as the Washington Treaty will not be considered. The Japanese side has also made very clear promises that it will respect the interests of the great powers in its occupied areas as much as possible and maintain the "open door." Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made the above promise on January 22 last year. Japanese senior officials have also repeatedly extended it. However, these promises are not in harmony with the evolution of the situation in North China and Central China. We occupy an important position in the Far Eastern economic structure and are eager for the agreement and the appropriate verification and announcement to match words and deeds and be faithfully implemented.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Destroy North China Currency</p>
<p>Regarding China's financial situation, you probably already know what the situation is like. Like other countries, there is more than one exchange rate for the currency. The exchange rate and the open market exchange rate vary from place to place due to restrictions on the transport of banknotes. Until March, the foreign exchange situation in Shanghai was still able to maintain perfection. However, after the establishment of the "North China United Reserve Bank" and its attempt to destroy the Chinese currency, foreign exchange restriction measures were implemented. As a result, brokers tried their best to find places to buy foreign exchange, and the "black market" began. Later, it became Shanghai's normal open market, separate from the strictly restricted exchange rate. The more restricted the market was by the allocation of exchange rates according to the exchange rate, the worse the exchange rate in the open market became. In mid-May, each yuan was worth 10 and a half pence. A month later, it fell to 8 pence. In early August, it fell to the lowest rate of 7 pence and 7/8. At that time, it received assistance, and the low tide turned immediately, and the exchange rate rose back to about 8 and a half pence. Since then, this exchange rate has been able to maintain a flat rate, and it has only been slightly changed when there are military or political developments or the spread of rumors. At the end of last year, not only did "capital outflow completely stop, but a considerable amount of withdrawn capital was also available. From the above description, it can be seen how difficult it was for bankers during the first nine months. Even now, it is still like this. I only call it the horror of "external forces," and the situation is still bleak.</p>

<h3>A View on the Evils of Early and Late Marriage</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Medical Department, Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Fula Quao said, "The children born to young couples are like fruits grown and cultivated in warm rooms in winter, tender and tasteless." This statement best describes the evils of early marriage. Therefore, few children born to early marriages are strong. As for the reasons for early marriage in our country, it is only because parents are too eager for grandchildren, thinking that if they have grandchildren, their parents will be sacrificed after their death, which is a big mistake. Therefore, what we should pay attention to is not to have more children, but to have better children.</p>
<p>As for late marriage, there are also evils. Men who marry after the age of 35 have lost most of their lively enthusiasm, and their physical strength and temperament have gradually weakened. The joy of marriage has been reduced a lot. Most of their children are not yet adults, and the father is already gray-haired and cannot fulfill his responsibility of raising them. Women who marry late in life often have obstacles in their reproductive organs, which easily lead to difficult labor and "hysteria."</p>
<p>The age difference between husband and wife is too great, and the physical strength and temperament are different, which is often the cause of discord in the family. For example, if the man is too old and the woman is too young, the man reluctantly satisfies the woman's sexual love, which will lead to physical and mental weakness throughout his life, leading to diseases such as incomplete development. Men and women of the same age, or women older than men, do not have much impact at the time of marriage, but later, when compared, the woman has aged, and the man is still young and strong, which is also the cause of discord in the family.</p>
<p>When it comes to love between husband and wife, those who are physiologically mature but not lewd are the happiest. Those who are lewd will definitely dissipate their energy and have many kidney deficiency problems. At the same time, if the husband is old, his energy will weaken, which is also one of the reasons for unhappiness between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Those with this kind of problem are indeed the main cause of family disharmony. However, modern medicine is advancing and is studying the endocrine of animal testicles as the basic strategy for treating sexual weakness. Among them, the most effective is "Buttico," a male animal youth glandular preparation invented by Dr. Meulen of Germany. Because it not only takes the testicular essence from chimpanzees, stags, and calves, but also infiltrates famous tonics from mineral plants, the refining is carried out under purple light with the latest scientific methods, so the main pure quality is completely preserved, and the remedy and resistance are appropriate, so that it can exert its full effect. Among the drugs for treating sexual dysfunction, there is none that surpasses it.</p>
<p>Today, medical scientists all praise the drug's power for the treatment of sexual weakness, because the drug's function actively promotes bone and muscle development in childhood, and can also relieve neurasthenia, promote reproductive function, nourish the brain, and nourish the kidneys. It also eliminates substances that damage the body and turns them into harmless substances, specializes in metabolic power, and makes the body and mind rejuvenate, restoring a happy and lively life. According to my personal observation, an old man who is already 60 years old, after taking three boxes of "Buttico" in a row, his asthma and insomnia completely disappeared, and he was able to walk leisurely without feeling tired at all, which proves its effectiveness. The female version ("Buttico") functions to regulate menstruation and seeds, and promote breast development, making it a sacred medicine for gynecology.</p>
<h3>The Healthy Path to Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>When discussing the treatment of nocturnal emission, it is imperative to strictly adhere to the principles of health preservation. This has a profound impact on the treatment process. Often, because sufferers are unaware of these principles, even the most experienced physicians find it difficult to help, leading to the worsening of the condition in numerous cases. Therefore, patients should either not seek treatment at all or, if they desire a swift return to health, pay utmost attention to health maintenance. Methods of health preservation include resolute abstinence from masturbation, avoidance of overexertion of the body and mind, avoidance of alcohol and late nights, abstaining from sour and spicy foods, regulating bowel movements, avoiding the reading of erotic books and viewing of erotic pictures, and cultivating a pure and desireless mind. These practices are highly beneficial to treatment, and patients are encouraged to adopt them.</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience treating thousands of patients over the past decade, the most effective medicine is undoubtedly "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Pills," invented by French physiologist Dr. Nairis. This is because its ingredients genuinely consolidate the seminal gate, calm the brain, and regulate endocrine function. Dr. Nairis holds a government honorary award in France, proving that this medicine is not comparable to ordinary, crudely manufactured products. Furthermore, electrotherapy, cold water friction, and other therapies can only serve as supplementary treatments, as their effectiveness is not as outstanding as this medicine. Other types of sperm-consolidating pills on the market are not worth considering at all. There are many young men in our country suffering from nocturnal emission. I hereby solemnly advise that if you wish to quickly restore your health, there is truly no other way.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Highest Peak in Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Let's not talk about theory, only about practice, because theory is, of course, an explanation of facts. In reality, gonorrhea, in this age of all-powerful science, is truly not a cause for concern. This is because the treatment of gonorrhea is improving daily, greatly differing from what it once was. This can certainly be proven by recent gonorrhea treatments. Originally, treating gonorrhea required a calm and persevering spirit to deal with it step by step. It is essential to avoid impatience and seeking quick success, or recklessly using potent drugs. Gonococci are inherently stubborn, and unless one proceeds systematically, combining suppression and pacification, it is impossible to completely eradicate them. Even if one achieves temporary success, the virus will recur shortly after, causing inflammation in various parts and endless future troubles.</p>
<p>Recently, in various European and American countries, a new change has occurred in the treatment of gonorrhea. Namely, a unanimous endorsement of "Clininon," a specific drug for gonorrhea. Furthermore, new statistics show that ordinary acute gonorrhea can be completely cured by taking four or five bottles of this medicine. Long-term, chronic gonorrhea, as well as prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, and other conditions, can be completely cured in almost all cases by taking "Clininon" for about seven or eight bottles. However, there are occasional exceptions, which are few in number. Furthermore, there are also cases where full efficacy is achieved with less than half a dozen bottles. According to Dr. Baulerson's statistics, since the invention of "Clininon" in Germany, over 98% of those who took this medicine were cured. Among chronic cases, 93% were completely cured and did not recur. This has achieved the highest peak in the history of gonorrhea treatment experience. Dr. Schiller also compared the effectiveness of "Clininon" with other newly produced drugs. The general new drugs are far inferior to "Clininon." Therefore, "Clininon" can remain ever new, greatly differing from the general drugs that are new today and old tomorrow. Every gonorrhea patient who is not cured by taking other drugs will be completely cured by taking "Clininon."</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<p>— Doctor Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<h3>Painless Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>Leucorrhea, along with buboes and chancres, is known in the venereal disease world for its painful nature, and it holds the top position. Anyone who has suffered from gonorrhea will certainly agree with what I say. Although general patients are naturally panicked and at a loss during acute gonorrhea, once they pass this acute stage, the pain gradually decreases, and the patient's attention fades along with the reduction of gonorrhea symptoms. They even believe that the disease has naturally healed, and they continue as before, which is extremely dangerous. In reality, gonorrhea sufferers often experience a deepening of leucorrhea symptoms, leading to gonococcal prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., which erupt one after another. Therefore, this kind of painless leucorrhea is much more dangerous than painful leucorrhea, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>Therefore, effective measures must be taken against this kind of painless leucorrhea. In the countless patients I have treated, the only effective therapies for this condition are German electrostatic therapy and X-ray therapy used in combination, along with orally administered "Clininon," the world-renowned holy medicine for gonorrhea, to completely resolve the gonococci that have penetrated deep inside, leaving no residual disease to cause recurrence. Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty patients will be seen each day, and the fee for each appointment is only fifty cents.</p>
<h3>No Worries About Lung Disease!</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Although hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in lung disease can startle patients, it is not an absolutely fatal condition. Therefore, in my clinical practice, I advise patients to absolutely maintain their health and actively take "Pulmonal," a specific medicine for lung disease produced in Germany, which truly has the effect of searching out and tonifying the lungs. This medicine has the effect of directly eradicating tubercle bacilli, resolving phlegm, suppressing coughs, and coagulating blood. It can also relieve hectic fever and night sweats, and all stages of lung disease can be completely cured.</p>

<h3>Pseudo "Municipal Government" Economic Panic: Rumor of Xiaoyuan Under Pressure, the Pseudo "Reformed Government" Intends to Make Things Difficult, Recent Rumors of Resignation and Replacement with a Stooge</h3>
<p>Since the pseudo "Municipal Government" abolished the pseudo "Consumption Tax," a major economic panic has erupted. As February has ended, there have been waves of "staff" reductions, "salary" cuts, and the abolition of affiliated organizations. The future fate of the pseudo "government" is becoming increasingly tragic and terrifying. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Golden Age: During the era of the pseudo "Superintendent Office" under Su Xiwenz, the monthly pseudo "Consumption Tax" revenue could reach 450,000 to 500,000 yuan. The actual expenses of the pseudo "office" and various pseudo "bureaus" only required 400,000 yuan, leaving a monthly surplus of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, like a shop. This was the golden age of the pseudo-organization. Since the jealous ascension of Chuan Xiaoyuan and the reorganization into the pseudo "Municipal Government," due to attempts to expand territory, the monthly budget suddenly increased to 600,000 yuan. As a result, income could not meet expenses, and the golden age became a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Staff Reductions and Salary Cuts: The pseudo "Reformed Government" even forced Fu Xiaoyuan to abolish thirty-eight kinds of "Consumption Taxes" with a pseudo "decree," only promising to subsidize the pseudo "government" with 400,000 yuan per month starting in February. At the end of last month, this subsidy was not received, revealing the deception. As a result, it was necessary to resort to "staff" reductions and "salary" cuts. All pseudo-officials, large and small, in the pseudo "government," pseudo "bureaus," and various pseudo "sections" (except for pseudo "bureau chiefs" and pseudo "section chiefs") were eliminated based on the complexity of their work, with a maximum reduction of 40%. Those who were not eliminated also had their "salaries" cut across the board. The pseudo "bureau chiefs'" pseudo "salaries" remained the same. Each pseudo "section chief" was only reduced by 20 yuan. Previously, pseudo "section members" received at least 100 yuan, but now it is reduced to 80 yuan. Pseudo "clerks" used to receive 60 yuan, but now it is reduced to 40 yuan, 45 yuan, and 50 yuan in three grades. Pseudo "secretaries" used to receive 40 yuan, but now it is reduced to 30 yuan, 35 yuan, and 40 yuan in three grades. Because the pseudo mayor, pseudo bureau chiefs, and pseudo secretaries were not reduced in salary, the lower-level pseudo-officials felt that the treatment was unfair and secretly cursed.</p>
<p>Fate of the Pseudo Government: After Fu Xiaoyuan was forced to carry out large-scale staff reductions, he also abolished several affiliated organizations, such as the pseudo "Luren Hospitals" in the four suburbs, pseudo "treatment centers," and pseudo "fire brigades." With this move, the budget could be reduced by 100,000 yuan per month. However, at least 500,000 yuan must still be spent each month to maintain operations. Since the "Reformed Government's" monthly subsidy of 400,000 yuan is hopeless, and there is no income this month, the future fate of the pseudo "government" will be even more tragic and terrifying. It is said that Chuan Xiaoyuan has been frowning and deeply locked in thought for days, regretting his initial decision to be a running dog.</p>
<p>Forced Resignation: However, according to those familiar with the inside story of the pseudo-organization, the pseudo "Reformed Government" has not fulfilled its promise of a 400,000 yuan subsidy. On the one hand, this is due to economic difficulties and self-preservation. On the other hand, it is also due to the pseudo "Reformed Government's" dissatisfaction with Chuan. Since Chuan's appearance, he has been self-aggrandizing in everything, repeatedly clashing with the pseudo "Reformed Government" over rights. The most obvious example is relying on background forces to expand territory (the "pseudo government" plans to seize ten counties in the suburbs). Also, conflicts with the "Jiangsu pseudo provincial government" over Jiading County and with the Nanjing "pseudo judicial administration department" over Shanghai's pseudo "judicial power" have all displeased Liang Hongzhi and his cohorts. Therefore, this time, they want to bring down Chuan, making it impossible for him to cope, forcing him to step down, and then appoint another stooge to replace him. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that Chuan will be transferred to the pseudo "Nanjing Municipal Superintendent," which is also for this reason.</p>
<p>Bean Curd Shop Apprentice Died Unnaturally: Shop Owner Suspected and Arrested</p>
<p>Yu Arong, the owner of the Fuxingfa Bean Curd Shop at 544 Connaught Road and a native of Liuhe, is related to the case of Wang Pan'gen, a 20-year-old apprentice from Tongzhou, who died from a head injury. The detective from the Gordon Road Police Station was dispatched the day before yesterday to arrest Yu Arong at his address and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the cause of the case was that at around 3:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Chinese Constable No. 242 of the Gordon Road Police Station was patrolling near Connaught Road when he suddenly saw a rickshaw puller pushing a patient, Wang Pan'gen, facing him. Someone named Qian Jindao followed behind. According to him, this patient was an apprentice at the Fuxingfa Bean Curd Shop. Recently, he became ill, but the shop owner, the defendant Yu Arong, refused to pay for a doctor to treat him and sent him to his maternal uncle, Chen Wenhou's home, to find a way to treat him. Chen also had no money and had to send Wang back to the shop. Unexpectedly, the defendant firmly refused to keep him and rejected his return. Qian Jindao found it difficult to arrange things. Because of the head injury on Wang's head, the defendant hit him with a wooden stick because he was clumsy in his work. Therefore, he sent him back to the shop again. On the way, he was discovered by the Chinese constable, who inquired about the situation and telegraphed the police station to send an ambulance to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, Wang's occipital bone was broken, and he died after a while. Now, the corpse has been transported to the mortuary for examination. The defendant claimed at the police station that the deceased accidentally fell from the upper floor at about 3:00 AM on the 27th of last month when he wanted to defecate, causing a head injury, and that he did not beat him. Please postpone the investigation, etc. Xu Xiaomao, an apprentice in the same shop, testified that the defendant did not injure the deceased's head, and that he injured himself by falling, etc. Magistrate Huang Risheng questioned the defendant Yu Arong and ordered him to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<h3>Maid Steals Money and Elopes: Plans to Return to Her Hometown with Her Lover, Case Solved and Sent to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Shao Leping, deputy manager of the Taiping Insurance Company, lives at No. 7, Lane 1457, Avenue Edward VII. He has a maid named Donglan, who has been working for him for seven years. The girl is now seventeen years old. After dinner on the 14th of last month, Shao instructed the girl to go upstairs to the bedroom to fetch clothes. Unexpectedly, she stole 250 yuan in legal tender from his pocket and escaped through the side door without a trace. Shao reported the case to the police and requested an investigation. The day before yesterday, the Chinese and Western detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station finally learned that the girl and her lover, Zhu Zhengkuan, a fellow villager from Jiangbei, were hiding in Room 16 of the Chongqing Hotel on Chongqing Road. They immediately arrested the girl and Zhu together. Upon searching them, they found only 95 yuan in legal tender and two travel permits to return to their hometown of Jiangbei, Yangzhou, issued by the Japanese. They were taken to the police station. Under questioning, they confessed that they planned to leave Shanghai and return to their hometown within days. 150 yuan of the stolen money was given to Zhu's father, and the rest, except for what was found, had already been spent. Zhu also confessed that his father runs a meal delivery business on Hardoon Road, and that the woman was referred to him by Yang Ma, a former maid dismissed from Shao's house, and that he did not entice her, etc. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Meng interrogated them.

<h3>Doctor's Wife Adultery with Barber: Kicks Concubine's Pregnant Belly During Confrontation, Husband Reports to Police Station and Sends Her to Court</h3>
<p>Wang Tianshou, a native of Yangzhou who resides at 274 Carter Road in West Shanghai, practices medicine. He has one wife and one concubine, both young and beautiful. His wife, Ms. Ba, has an affair with Feng Deyou, a worker at the Xingji Barber Shop located downstairs. At 2:30 PM on the 27th of last month, Wang's concubine, Ms. Zhu, happened to go to the wife's room and witnessed Yan and Feng lying on the bed together. She informed Wang Tianshou, who then</p>
<p>Caught a Pair of Adulterers</p>
<p>and sent them to the Zhabei Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, Wang claimed that he would file for divorce from Yan and did not want to request an investigation or public prosecution for adultery. Therefore, all the men and women were reprimanded and dismissed. After returning home, Yan harbored deep hatred for Zhu for exposing her adultery. She</p>
<p>Made Veiled Accusations</p>
<p>and deliberately provoked quarrels. Wang and others already disdained her and did not argue with her. However, Yan not only failed to restrain herself but also suddenly broke into Zhu's room at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, kicked Zhu's abdomen, and cursed loudly. Wang Tianshou then called Chinese Constable No. 2634, who arrested Yan and took her to the Zhabei Police Station, and then</p>
<p>Sent Her to Women's Prison for Detention.</p>
<p>He then sent Zhu to the hospital for examination. It was found that she was pregnant but had not been injured. However, after returning home, she suddenly felt severe abdominal pain and was immediately taken to the Boai Hospital. After examination by the hospital, it was found that the fetus had moved and was about to abort. Therefore, when the police sent Wang Yan to the First Special District Local Court for trial yesterday morning, the victim, Wang Zhu, was unable to attend court due to her injuries and treatment, and instead,</p>
<p>Wang Tianshou Filed the Case</p>
<p>and explained the circumstances. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, immediately requested that the case be postponed. The defendant then hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to defend her, claiming that she had been falsely accused of adultery by Zhu and others. Magistrate Meng Tingke then questioned the defendant and ordered her to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>A Total of 50,000 Yuan for Living Expenses</p>
<p>Zheng Zuoyi, 21, the son of Zheng Mengyuan, a Chaozhou native and owner of the Koucheng Pawnshop on Albert Road in the French Concession, who has assets of five to six million yuan and works at the Ning Shao Insurance Company, was introduced to Zhang Xiuying, a woman from Wuxi who currently resides at No. 4, Lane 42, Rue Loehr, in 1935. Zhang was 19 years old at the time. Zheng claimed that he was not yet married and pledged eternal love. They lived together at No. 76 Jing'an Villa. On August 18, 1938, both parties requested a certificate from lawyer Chen Yongsheng and signed a marriage agreement, setting a deadline of September 22 of the same year for a formal wedding. If there was a breach of contract, the man would compensate the woman 50,000 yuan for living expenses. Unexpectedly, Zheng broke the contract and engaged another woman. Zhang Xiuying learned of this and sent a letter asking him to fulfill the contract. Zheng replied that he had engaged another woman due to his parents' orders, and that he would pay the agreed compensation later, etc. However, Zheng still did not fulfill the contract. Therefore, Zhang Xiuying hired lawyer Ma Zhenzong to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Zheng Zuoyi for breach of contract and recovery of 50,000 yuan in living expenses. Zheng hired lawyers Xue Dubi and Cao Shuling to file a defense and counterclaim, requesting the cancellation of the signed contract, etc. After Magistrate Wu Xiaoke held two hearings to summon witnesses and hear arguments, he announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled a date for judgment. The details have been reported in this newspaper twice. Yesterday was the scheduled date for judgment in this case. Magistrate Wu presided over the Seventh Civil Court and ruled that the defendant should compensate the plaintiff 50,000 yuan in national currency, and the litigation costs would be borne by the defendant.</p>

If she chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at two yuan per day. The opium will be confiscated and destroyed.</p>
<p>Pseudo Local Court to Dissolve</p>
<p>After the pseudo "Local Court President" Tu Fu was killed last month, the vacancy was temporarily filled by Fei Guoxi, the pseudo "court president," who was appointed by the pseudo "Minister of Judicial Administration" Hu Rentai of the pseudo "Reformed Government." During this transitional period, all civil and criminal litigation cases were seized by the pseudo "Shanghai Municipal Government Judicial Office." Therefore, the court has no official business to conduct. All pseudo-officials, large and small, are merely sitting idly by each day. Xi felt that this was quite boring and has submitted his resignation to the pseudo "Ministry of Judicial Administration." It is expected that the "court" may soon be dissolved.</p>

Therefore, he has accumulated considerable wealth, his social circle is wider than before, and he has purchased a new car for transportation.

It is now reported that Tao received two warning letters several days before the incident, urging him to repent and resign, but Tao ignored them and continued to go to the "Bureau" to "work" every day, leading to this decisive event. The truth remains to be verified.</p>

<h3>Finance Northern Speculators Are Still Advancing Vigorously Cash Prices First Rise and Then Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash Hechi grey market situation, although there was no excessive ups and downs, the situation was quite abrupt. Generally, it was strong first and then turned weak. Initially, because a certain customer purchased a large amount on behalf of northern speculators, and a certain silver shop also tracked and purchased on behalf of local gangs, the potential labor was quite strong for a time. Later, because the foreign exchange slightly reported loose hardness, and the hearts of all parties were inherently tired, ordinary retail investors sold off one after another, and the reaction line was weak. As a result, it only fell by one yuan. Transactions were strong in the morning and clear in the afternoon, with a total of 800 taels of transactions. Silver shop ornaments still did not see any historical movement. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rose upward.</p>
<p>Hechi Grey Market Falls One Yuan</p>
<p>Since there was no initial transaction every morning (ten taels), it was not until about 10 o'clock that a certain broker was seen paying 50 taels to the northern customers, with an opening price of 2,130 yuan, which was similar to the previous day. After the opening, because a certain broker's purchase was more and more enthusiastic, coupled with a certain silver shop tracking and absorbing purchases on behalf of local gangs, although a certain Yuhao sold off, the momentary head room still felt that the demand was greater than the supply, and gradually rose. Qianduiye entered Jinhao 50 taels, priced at 31 yuan. Then, a certain broker also entered Jinhao 150 taels, priced at 32 yuan. Later, he also entered the cash shop 50 taels at the same price. Before long, a certain silver shop also entered the Yuhao 100 taels on behalf of the local gang, and 50 taels of the same industry at the same price. Suddenly, after a certain silver shop absorbed it, it suddenly sold it back to a certain broker for 50 taels, priced at 33 yuan. Qianduiye entered the silver shop gang 50 taels, 35 yuan. A certain broker then entered the securities gang 50 taels, 37 yuan. After that, foreign exchange slightly loosened, and people's hearts suddenly went downstream. Sellers were active, and those who entered were very lacking, and the decline was quite severe. Qianduiye mutually did 50 taels, 32 yuan. Later, Qianduiye sold to the silver shop gang 50 taels at 2,128 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because foreign exchange was sluggish and constant, and the supply and demand between the two sides was even more sparse, the transaction was sparse. First, Qianduiye mutually did 50 taels, 28 yuan. Later, Qianduiye sold to Jinhao 50 taels at 2,129 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by one yuan compared to the previous day, a difference of nine yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,140 yuan, and the receiving price was 2,125 yuan. The current margin is listed at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is no opening.</p>
<p>Ornament Exchange Price Still Not Changed</p>
<p>The exchange price per tael of silver shop ornaments has not changed, Datonghang is still hanging 216 yuan, Xin Tonghang is 214 yuan, and the receiving price is 208 yuan.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong and Foreign Banks Eagerly Sell Foreign Exchange, but Settlement Demand Remains Strong, Leading to Initial Loosening Followed by Equilibrium; HSBC Netherlands Telegraphic Transfer at 6.25</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw a surge in selling from Hong Kong and British HSBC banks, as well as other foreign banks. Although foreign banks and foreign exchange firms were eager to purchase on behalf of Tianjin foreign merchants, banks, and Chinese banks, the market still felt oversupplied. This led to a temporary loosening of the upward momentum. The exchange rate for British gold sovereigns reached 8 pence 140625, and the US dollar also rose to 15.90625 yuan. However, sudden settlement demand from oil companies and other foreign firms, as well as purchasing settlements from foreign power companies and Chinese cotton and yarn merchants, quickly brought the market back to equilibrium. As a result, there were no significant gains or losses. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained largely unchanged due to balanced supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the morning, London's near-term large-denomination notes contracted by 0.125, and forward rates also decreased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained unchanged. The price of gold in London rose by 2 pence. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars was up by 6 mills, unchanged against the French franc, and down slightly by 0.0625 against the Shanghai dollar. The US dollar rose by 0.1875 against the British pound, rose by 0.0625 against the French franc, and was unchanged against the Shanghai dollar. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained fixed. The opening selling prices for banks in the morning were 8 pence 125 for British gold sovereigns and 15.875 yuan for US dollars, on par with the previous closing prices. After the opening, foreign HSBC banks sold British gold sovereigns to Chinese banks and foreign exchange firms at 8 pence 140625, causing a slight loosening of the upward momentum. HSBC announced its listed exchange rates, with the Netherlands telegraphic transfer rate increasing by 6.25, while other rates remained unchanged. The Silver Equalization Tax was announced to be reduced by half a point, totaling 7.5%. Later, Hong Kong electric companies and foreign banks sold US dollars to Chinese banks at 15.90625 yuan, maintaining a loose state. Subsequently, oil companies and power companies suddenly engaged in aggressive purchases. Texaco and Asiatic settled with HSBC at 8 pence 125 for British gold sovereigns. Following this, a power company purchased US dollars from a Sino-Belgian bank at 15.875 yuan, reinforcing the upward momentum.</p>
<h3>Securities: Cotton Yarn In, Government Bonds Out; Market Prices Largely Unaffected; Optimism for the Future Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>In the unofficial securities market yesterday, after intense competition between bulls and bears, the bulls gradually gained the upper hand. Market prices shifted from weak to firm and stable. Market prices have been suppressed for several days due to the Wu faction of yarn merchants selling government bonds to bolster cotton yarn. Over the past few days, sales have reached three to four hundred thousand yuan, yet the overall appearance has not wavered. Much of this released capital has been gradually absorbed by smaller financial institutions, and the environment shows signs of improvement. The concession issue has been peacefully resolved, and banks are offering discounts of 5% on the 7th installment of Series A winning lottery tickets and the interest coupons of the 6th installment of various unified government bonds. This is a definitive fact. The German envoy traveled from Chongqing to Japan, raising hopes for a Sino-Japanese settlement. Furthermore, large international loans are strengthening the stability of China's legal tender. Yesterday's performance, transitioning from weak to firm, suggests a significant rebound is imminent. At the opening, #38 first sold over two hundred thousand yuan of Series B bonds, followed by #10. The market price decreased slightly, only by two or three cents. Simultaneously, #35 took advantage of the low prices to buy a significant amount. #38 then switched to purchasing Series A bonds, also amounting to over two hundred thousand yuan. Yue Mao, Northern Gang #11, and Xiang Feng also absorbed a considerable amount. #46 and Xie Da still made small sales, but retail demand remained strong. Near the close, sellers began to withdraw, and Series E bonds rebounded from 5.80 yuan to 6.10 yuan. At closing, demand remained high, with bids at 0.02 yuan but no supply. Consequently, other varieties also showed signs of strengthening. Ultimately, Series B and D bonds increased by 0.05 yuan, Series C and E remained unchanged, and Series A decreased slightly by 0.05 yuan. Total transactions amounted to approximately 700,000 yuan. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, a small number of shares of Dasheng First Factory were traded at 23.50 yuan. Shares of Nanshi Huashang Electric Power were bid at 5.20 yuan, but no supply was available.</p>
<p>On March 1st (Wednesday), the listed prices for London-traded Chinese foreign currency bonds showed that only the Anglo-German Continuing Loan and British bonds experienced a decline of half a pound, priced at 73.50 pounds, due to the interest payment period approaching. (This loan bears interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, payable in two installments on March 1st and September 1st each year. Each installment pays 2 pounds and 5 shillings per 100-pound bond. Typically, the market price should also fall by 2 pounds and 0 shillings. However, today's telegram only showed a drop of half a pound. If the telegram is accurate, then the market price has actually increased by 1.50 pounds compared to the previous day. Readers are advised to take note.) All other prices remained unchanged. The supply of physical goods in London was limited, with only the Railway Bonds slightly embellished. 5,000 pounds of the Hu-Guang Railway Bonds (non-German issued) were sold at 21 pounds, on par with the market price. Additionally, 3,000 pounds of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Continuing Bonds (German issued) were sold at 15 pounds and 15 shillings, down 5 shillings from the listed price. Market sentiment was sluggish, and the foundation seemed weak.</p>
<p>On March 1st (Wednesday), the listed prices for shares of British Far East companies in London showed that the Kaiping Mining (bearer shares) rose by 1.5 pence, priced at 17 shillings and 4.5 pence. The Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares rose by 7.5 pence, priced at 20 shillings. The rest showed no changes.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: User Silk Prices Approaching the 2,000 Yuan Mark; Yokohama Silk Market Remains Closed</h3>
<p>The international silk market in Yokohama was ordered to halt auctions the night before due to excessive price surges. The decision to halt silk market trading is due to an increase in price. One side of this issue is demand, another is economic stagnation, anxiousness, and fear that inflation has already started in Japan. New York and Lyon silk markets continued to reach new peaks yesterday. Japanese silk 83 was up another 8 points, 75 Japanese silk was up 9 points, Shanghai silk was up 5 points, and Guangdong silk was up 7 points. Lyon Japanese silk was up 1.50 French francs, Shanghai silk was up 3 French francs, B-mark silk was up 4.50 French francs, and Guangdong silk was up 4 French francs. The New York Exchange's near-term contracts were up 7 points, and forward contracts were up 3 points, with extremely active trading. Yesterday's trading volume opened at 1,980 bundles, a phenomenon unseen in years.</p>
<p>The local silk market is experiencing strong price increases, but also significant disorder. Buyers and sellers alike are disoriented, and occasional transactions lack any consistency, with price differences of 50-60 yuan for the same grade of silk between morning and afternoon. As a result, prudent individuals are temporarily ceasing trading. The price of B-mark white silk has already been sold at 1,940 yuan. A silk price of 2,000 yuan was once considered a dream, but is now within reach. As for raw silk trading, Zha Qi Yin Zhuang has shifted from firm to clear. Sales of British and American silk have ceased early. The user silk market saw trading of 50-60 bundles, with asking prices reportedly approaching 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 162 bales of lake silk and 86 bales of silk waste were shipped to Europe.</p>
<p>Additionally, 562 boxes of tea were also shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Sales Increase Significantly After Mill Price Reduction</h3>
<p>The flour market continues to soften, with sporadic sales from both Northern and Southern merchants, lacking any large-scale transactions. Rumors suggest that two ships carrying foreign wheat have been fixed and will arrive soon, causing buyers to become more cautious. Mills are unwilling to further reduce prices, resulting in a transaction volume of less than 30,000 bags, handled piecemeal by Northern and Southern merchants. Local trading has increased after the mill price reduction of 0.05 yuan, reaching nearly 10,000 bags. There are rumors that mills may further lower prices by 0.05 yuan for merchant orders, making it difficult to be optimistic about the market. Yesterday, 3,800 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 500 bags to Yantai, and 16,800 bags to Hong Kong for transshipment to Yantai.</p>
<p>The wheat market lacks any distinctive features, with limited supply and thin inventory. Sellers are holding firm on prices, but rumors of fixed foreign wheat shipments arriving soon are impacting the outlook for local wheat. Mills are showing little interest, with only 300 bags of Chuzhou wheat traded at 6.80 yuan, purchased by Fuxin Mill. The market is still brewing.</p>
<h3>Glutinous Rice Opens at 16.70 Yuan, Up Half a Yuan Significantly</h3>
<p>After a continuous surge in price, glutinous rice prices rose even more sharply yesterday. This is due to supply disruptions since the Lunar New Year, limited arrivals of new rice, and increased demand, resulting in a persistent supply shortage. Yesterday's opening price reached 16.70 yuan, a significant increase of half a yuan. As for thick and thin japonica rice, arrivals remain scarce. Only the third shipment arrived downstream, with 500-600 bags transported by boat and over 3,000 bags transported by rail to the port. Major hoarders continue to show strong interest, and local stores are also increasingly enthusiastic, maintaining a tight situation. The market continues to rise by 0.10 to 0.15 yuan, with Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian following suit by a few cents to a dime.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Inquiries from Shantou and Xiamen</h3>
<p>There were inquiries about customer Xian rice from Shantou and Xiamen merchants. The market continues to rise. However, there is a shortage of high-quality rice, and owners are reluctant to sell, causing high-quality Wu Xian rice to rise to 11.75 yuan, and ordinary market rice to rise to 11.30-11.40 yuan. No transactions have been made for Nanjing high-quality Xian rice due to price disagreements. Over 3,000 bags were traded in the unified market, with prices increasing by 0.04-0.05 yuan to 0.10 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Shortage, Market Prices Tight</h3>
<p>Soybean prices have risen repeatedly due to strong reports of origin prices and steady oilseed prices. Spot soybeans from Dalian are scarce. Japanese merchants continue to actively sell futures, with eight trucks of Sipingjie soybeans for April delivery priced at 8.07-8.08 yuan. Return shipments for ten-day delivery are priced at 8.10 yuan. In other transactions, over 500 bags of Chongming sand soybeans were purchased by Xiamen merchants from local markets. Over 200 bags of Du soybeans were traded, with the market becoming increasingly tight.</p>
<h3>Declining Market Sentiment in Wheat Bran; Bulls Disappointed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat bran market showed signs of loosening. Prices in Qingdao plummeted by 0.60 yuan, causing the bulls to lose momentum and easing market sentiment. However, mills remain closed, preventing any domestic sales. Only 500 small bags of Fuxin bran were returned at 4.37 yuan, and 600 small bags of Fufeng bran were returned at 4.35 yuan. The future market situation remains volatile, with over 140,000-150,000 bags of futures needing to be sold.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Red Dates Continue to Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Red dates, which bottomed out at 25-26 yuan last winter, rebounded to 27-28 yuan and have continued to rise this spring. Initially at 31 yuan, then 33 yuan, yesterday saw a batch of higher-quality dates traded at 35 yuan, nearly 10 yuan above the lowest price. Currently, merchants from Hong Kong and Shantou are showing interest. With limited market inventory, continued tightness is likely.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Limited Domestic Sugar Supply</h3>
<p>Domestic sugar transactions remain sporadic. Yesterday, Chaozhou merchants offered 72 bags of Ming Cheng Zhuang Zheng Mian red sugar, with excellent color, priced at 16 yuan, down slightly by 0.02 yuan from before. Dozens of bags of Huanggang Qing sugar were priced at 15.50 yuan. Some superior rock white and ice flower white sugar were offered, with prices remaining unchanged. Twenty bags of miscellaneous inferior white sugar were priced at 18.80 yuan. Shipments from Jinan have been delayed en route and are expected to arrive today. There are 2,070 bags of sugar arriving from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Becomes a Speculative Game; Market Fluctuations Extremely Rapid; A Rabbit-Like Ascent and Hawk-Like Descent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had been bullish the day before, turned bearish again, resembling a rabbit-like ascent and hawk-like descent. While actual demand has decreased somewhat, purchasing from Northern and Southern merchants remains relatively strong. For example, Tianjin merchants have a substantial demand for 10-count coarse yarn and are actively searching the market. Therefore, the price of coarse yarn has not only not fallen, but has become tighter. Mills have long stopped spinning this product, and mill inventories are low. Hoarders only hold 20-count yarn and have no intention of hoarding 10-count yarn. As a result, market prices are strong when business picks up. Interest from Yunnan has waned slightly, but overall purchases are still decent. However, there is excessive internal speculative trading among market participants. People gather in the market, rushing to buy when prices are tight and quickly selling when prices loosen. This is similar to exchange-traded standard yarn, with similar volatility. Therefore, 20-count Tiannv yarn has become a representative standard, experiencing significant fluctuations. Recently, there has been increased speculative trading, leading to more rapid price changes and increased transaction volume.</p>
<p>Regarding the spot yarn situation, the market opened weak in the morning due to merchants temporarily suspending purchases after bulk acquisitions the previous day. Speculation arose that actual demand had ceased, causing the market to stagnate. Retailers began to sell off, immediately lowering prices by 0.075 yuan, with 20-count Zhi Ma yarn at 402 yuan. With few buyers, a speculative wind arose, gradually decreasing prices and breaking through the 400-yuan mark. The lowest price was 397 yuan, with warehouse receipts traded at 394.5 yuan. The low price triggered buyers to return and purchase, recovering to 401 yuan by closing. The market weakened again in the afternoon, falling to 399 yuan before recovering to 400 yuan at closing. In total, merchants purchased 2,830 bales. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 2.75 yuan compared to the previous day, Tiannv yarn fell by 2.5 yuan, Shuang Di Qiu yarn fell by 1 yuan, and Te Yu Cheng remained flat. However, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 2 yuan due to strong demand. Dasheng Mill offered 450 bales of 10-count Hong Kuixing yarn at 285 yuan. Yong An Mill offered 300 bales of 10-count Jia He yarn at 281 yuan. Xin Yu Mill offered 150 bales of 10-count Di Qiu yarn at 293 yuan. An Da Mill offered 250 bales of 20-count Fei Hu yarn at 394-395 yuan. Today, 390 pieces of yarn were exported to Tianjin and 25 pieces to Yantai. The purchase volume of each merchant is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is calm. Apart from relatively active buying from Tianjin merchants, there were few other transactions. The spot price for 20-count Shui Yue yarn is 336 yuan, and the spot price for 20-count Lan Feng yarn is 330 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Batches of Yao Cotton Arrive; Local Cotton Trading Expands</h3>
<p>Local cotton business has suddenly become active, with both mills and factories in need. Transactions are lively, and market prices are stable. Due to rising foreign cotton prices and reduced exchange rates, leading to higher purchase prices, the momentum of local cotton is increasing. Arrivals, however, remain minimal. Available goods are not particularly outstanding. Yao clothing, however, has completed procedures, with arrivals to Shanghai daily. Yesterday, three ships carrying a total of 17,000-18,000 bales of cotton arrived. This cotton is distributed and sold to manufacturers by cotton merchants. The trading volume and market prices for spot cotton are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Demand Remains Active at Factories</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices rose slightly in New York in the morning. However, due to continuous cotton market increases for two weeks, there was some reactionary profit-taking yesterday, as well as short-covering and selling on Wall Street. The cotton market fell slightly by two to four points. The Indian cotton market is exceptionally firm, rising another rupee yesterday. The Mumbai market is closed today, but forecasts remain high. Egyptian cotton rose by 7 points. Yesterday, exchange rates loosened slightly, reducing legal tender costs. US and Brazilian cotton fell by 0.10 yuan per dan (unit of weight), Egyptian cotton fell by 0.20 yuan, and Indian cotton rose by over 0.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading remained lively yesterday. Although Indian prices have been rising for days, they are still relatively cheaper than domestic cotton. As a result, factories are conducting some foreign cotton transactions. An Da Mill acquired 300 bales of Ping Guoer cotton, with delivery to the factory costing only 59 yuan, comparable to the special Yao cotton offered at over 66 yuan the day before. Furthermore, Indian cotton has lower moisture content, allowing for water weight rebates. Shen Xin purchased 200 bales of North Brazilian cotton, arriving at the end of the month, with delivery to the factory costing only 81 yuan, significantly cheaper than Tongzhou American cotton. Xin Yu purchased 1,000 bales of White Rock cotton, with delivery to the factory costing 73 yuan, and 500 bales of lower-grade US cotton at 74 yuan. Xin Sheng purchased 1,000 bales of lower-grade Peng Jiapu cotton at 71.5 yuan. Chang Xing Cotton also ordered 500 bales of Peng Jiapu cotton at 71 yuan. On the Japanese factory side, Gong Da purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton, Yu Feng purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton, Shanghai purchased 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, and Rihua purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton. Yesterday's foreign cotton prices, converted to delivered factory prices, are listed below.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Sell Briskly; Domestic Cloth Follows Suit</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth is showing signs of recovery due to the rebound in Eastern piece goods made from Japanese cotton yarn and the support of current sales from merchants. The purchasing appetite from Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Eastern regions has strengthened, and market sentiment is bullish. However, market attacks remain extremely chaotic. Morning spot prices for Tianjin Heng Yuan Mill's pao che fine cloth were 12.60-12.65 yuan, while list prices were 12.90 yuan. There were also fluctuations of 0.10 yuan for Da Yi Gui fine cloth. Many merchants are playing price games. Prices for coarse cloth and fine twill cloth remain firm. Merchants from Wen and Yong (Wenzhou and Ningbo) purchased over 200 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, bleached goods, poplin, etc. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan continued to purchase 150-160 pieces of printed sateen, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and twill. Merchants from Guangdong purchased over 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Wholesale sales of colored cloth in the local market are strongest in Subei's Shuyang and Funing regions. Local underwear businesses are actively purchasing plain cloth, patterned cloth, and new patterned poplin, reaching a transaction volume of 2,000-3,000 pieces. Bleaching and dyeing factories have acquired nearly 5,000 pieces of gray cloth, including fine twill, patterned bleached cloth, and twill, both spot and futures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Eastern white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill sold well, with spot and futures purchases reaching over 1,000 pieces due to Tianjin merchants' purchases. Selling prices rose sharply, increasing by 0.10 yuan per piece. Local market sales were only 500-600 bales, but traders were actively opening spot and futures contracts with various foreign firms. Ito's alone offered around 1,000 pieces of fine cloth, including Caiqiu, Feiyu, Longtou, and Laba brands. Other Eastern cotton and Nisshin cotton also had several hundred pieces sold. Spot prices for Caiqiu and Feiyu brands were 12.30 yuan per piece, and the current month's futures were 12.35 yuan per piece. Spot and futures prices differed by only 0.05 yuan per piece. Therefore, traders are continuing to purchase the recent goods, and the market is strong and firm.</p>
<p>Today, 170 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin and 23 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Soybean Cake Continues to Rise; Raw Soybean Oil Rebounds in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The peanut oil market is quite chaotic, brewing for a long time, but ultimately shifting from weak to tight, increasing by 0.30-0.40 yuan compared to the previous market. Transactions included 700 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and 200 cans of Qingdao oil (see market price section for details). The soybean oil market was sluggish in the morning due to lackluster sales, but sentiment improved in the afternoon due to continuous increases in Dalian. Prices followed suit, increasing by a fraction of a yuan. Transactions included 400 barrels of Dalian oil, 200 pieces of Dalian oil, and 100 barrels for delivery next March. Other transactions included 210 pieces of Yanqi and Lianqi oil delivered. Soybean cake prices have risen sharply due to continuous demand from Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Shantou. The market continues to rise by 0.05 yuan. Transactions included 500 pieces of Da You Four brand cake at 3.45 yuan, 2,000 pieces of Pu Li Four brand cake also at 3.45 yuan, and 9,000 pieces of Jiang Bei small cake at 0.0659 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,000 cans and 200 baskets of raw oil arrived from Yantai, and 800 cans arrived from Qingdao. Qingdao also shipped 800 bags of raw peanuts.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Charcoal, Previously Banned for Export, Causes Supply Shortage; Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Wenzhou charcoal, previously banned for export, has resulted in a complete cut-off of supply. At the end of the previous lunar year, Shanghai's inventory was only over 12,000 dan, causing panic. Red Traders have been vigorously bidding up prices. 35-pound Da Qing Jian charcoal is now at 4.20 yuan per dan, Ping Lou Qi is at 3.80 yuan, and Huang Yan bamboo charcoal is at 3.30 yuan. Prices have risen by 0.30-0.40 yuan. However, the association has received a telegram from Wenzhou approving exports. Subsequent shipments will be arriving in Shanghai in large quantities, and the market price of charcoal is expected to fall.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Native Products Shipped to Europe and Africa</h3>

<h3>National Education Conference</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The news of the National Education Conference being held in Chongqing filled me with great joy.</p>
<p>In this period of constant gunfire and widespread devastation, with everyone focused on resisting the enemy, it seems that military affairs are paramount and everything else becomes secondary. Yet we are now holding this conference, which shows that our war effort has a comprehensive plan. The fact that all affairs can proceed as usual is a sign of our confidence in ultimate victory. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>The attendees of this conference can be said to bring together national education administrators and renowned educators in one place, with virtually no omissions. This further demonstrates that the strength of our central government and our spirit of unity have not been weakened, but rather have increased significantly. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>These are the two reasons for my joy.</p>
<p>We cannot yet know what will be discussed at this conference, or what proposals will be presented. However, I can confidently predict that its proceedings will be smooth and its results will be satisfactory. Because in this time and in this situation, who would not work together harmoniously, discuss things humbly, and devote their wisdom and ability to serving the country!</p>
<p>I am not an educator, so I have no special opinions to offer to the conference. Moreover, the "Education News" section of this newspaper is filled with the erudite opinions of various educators, and the experts attending the conference will surely have profound plans that far surpass anything I could imagine. Therefore, I, perhaps along with the general non-educator public, can only listen quietly to their brilliant arguments and await their success.</p>
<p>However, even a fool's thoughts can be worthwhile. I believe that what is most important now is to focus on the "war effort." Education that has already been damaged must of course be restored to prosperity. Education that is proceeding normally should be reformed or improved without delay, so it is practical.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that Zhejiang has a "Wartime University" and Jiangsu has "Mobile Schools," and that many other specialized schools have been established to adapt to the times. I fully support these efforts. I hope that schools throughout the country will adhere to this principle: to promote the strength of the war effort.</p>
<p>Therefore, I urge our educators on this "isolated island" to also give it more consideration!</p>
<h3>A Record of Mr. Cao Juren (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Zijin</p>
<p>1.  The Green Bamboo Cloth Gown</p>
<p>Mr. Cao perpetually wore a green bamboo cloth gown and a pair of unvarnished black leather shoes; sometimes perhaps two pairs of black cloth shoes. This society values outward appearance, and this is where he suffered.</p>
<p>At banquets, even when lecturing at Jinan University, the old-fashioned guests and the playboy-like students would invariably mistake him for a lowly servant: a tea boy. He humorously remarked, "Sometimes I really want to wear a smart Western suit and a pair of old-fashioned glasses." But he remained, through and through, in that green bamboo cloth gown, irrespective of the lush spring, sweltering summer, bleak autumn, or frigid winter.</p>
<p>This man commands respect; to capture his essence, the word "simplicity" must be emphasized.</p>
<p>2.  The "Mouse" of Scholarship</p>
<p>To borrow a phrase from Anatole France, this man is a "library mouse." This not only means that he voraciously devoured books but also that his scholarship was as "precise" and "detailed" as a mouse.</p>
<p>This man grew up amidst stacks of old books; naturally, he spent considerable energy on "old paper." But he was not a submissive prisoner of this "national treasure"; on the contrary, he treated it like an impartial and astute judge.</p>
<p>There are people in the world whose vision is like a vegetable oil lamp, who revere all ancient books as scriptures, nodding and swaying endlessly, unaware of whether they are being duped. This man despised such pedantic scholars. Carlyle said, "The ignorant are below, the thoughtful are in the middle, and the observers are above." Scholarly pursuits cannot do without discerning vision; pedantic scholars only know how to blindly read, lacking any critical spirit, muttering and mumbling their entire lives. Stacks upon stacks of ancient books crush them into inferior, pedantic scholars. "Scholars and licentiates," he said, "are all useless treasures." Is this statement not excessive?</p>
<p>The second type of scholar he disdained was the "bookcase" that "absorbs knowledge like the Gobi Desert absorbs water, yet cannot spout a clear spring onto the ground." It is said that in his early years, when studying in Hangzhou, this man greatly admired the textual critic Mr. Shan Bu'an, but an "allegiance that lasted for ten years" eventually collapsed entirely because Mr. Shan was merely a bookcase.</p>
<p>"My second encounter with Master Shan Bu'an was in the West Lake Provincial Library (in 1927). This encounter completely disillusioned me. He was so erudite, yet so lacking in his own insights; he read a great deal, but never organized it into a system." (Literary Jottings: My Reading Experiences.)</p>
<p>The French essayist Michel de Montaigne ridiculed such bookcases as being like someone needing fire who goes to a neighbor to get it but, upon seeing a blazing fire, stays there to warm himself, forgetting to bring it home. "Do we think we have done enough just by hoarding the opinions and knowledge of others?" he questioned. "What good does it do us if our bellies are full of meat? If we cannot digest it, if we cannot transform it into our own, if it cannot increase our growth and strength?" (See On Education.) The most important thing in reading is to never lock the dregs of others' thoughts in one's own mind. Montaigne, with his extensive knowledge and insightful views, is admirable precisely for this reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao was also this type of scholar. The admirable aspects of his scholarship can be summarized in his own words on writing books: (1) Always doubt the ancients and ancient books; (2) Have the courage to betray one's teachers and elders; (3) Organize one's own system of thought.</p>
<h3>Use Our Iron and Blood to Fight for Freedom</h3>
<p>— Dai Cangqi</p>
<h3>Five Points on "Scolding People"</h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>"Scolding people" seems like bad behavior. However, there is absolutely no one who has never scolded anyone in their life. Moreover, as long as one is not drunk or insane, when a person dares to scold others, it is a sign of courage. If the scolding is justified, the person who can scold is a person of great integrity.</p>
<p>Here are two people: one scolding people with righteous indignation; the other bowing and scraping to everyone, saying nothing but "Admiration, admiration." Let's compare them; what do we see?</p>
<p>However, scolding can be harsh, but it must not be slanderous; it can be exaggerated, but it must not be fabricated.</p>
<p>Harsh and exaggerated scolding can become literature; slander and fabrication can never become literature.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the members of the Fushe Society scolded Ruan Hu Zi. Ruan Hu Zi's retaliatory measures were slander and fabrication. At that time, Ruan Hu Zi was victorious. But the Fushe Society's writings that scolded Ruan Hu Zi have been passed down to the present, and even Ruan Hu Zi, who was indeed a literary figure, left behind not a single word of his slander and fabrication, except for a story that is still being scolded.</p>
<p>However, there is also a great taboo: trying to force someone who is not a clown into becoming one, even if one has great talent, will not work. The result often does not go as intended.</p>
<p>In the writings of a Ming Dynasty "remnant" who surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, there is a poem mocking Li Zicheng. The last two lines are:</p>
<p>"The rebel does not seek pleasure in sights and sounds,</p>
<p>But single-mindedly strives to cause the Ming's demise."</p>
<p>The author probably thought it was witty. But the first line precisely describes Li Zicheng's virtues, and the second line is completely false. Everyone knows that it was people like Wu Sangui who "single-mindedly strove to cause the Ming's demise," and everyone knows that Li Zicheng was a Han Chinese who was exterminated by the Qing Dynasty. This wit is not witty at all.</p>
<p>If one is not righteously indignant and wants to scold people, even if one writes it out in literary form, it will not become good literature.</p>
<p>However, there is another great taboo. It is still about a Ming Dynasty "remnant" who surrendered to the Qing Dynasty: Qian Qianyi was imprisoned by the Qianlong Emperor. Because none of his fellow townsmen came to visit him, he scolded all the people of Changshu. That was also written out in literary form. But it didn't work; that kind of thing is just street scolding.</p>
<p>Having become a traitor and relying on the power of the new master to act as a bully in one's hometown, one then hopes that the townspeople will inquire after one's well-being when one falls out of favor. The idea is certainly safe, but it only further exposes one's shamelessness.</p>
<p>To scold people, one must first not be scolded by others. Otherwise, "scolding people" really becomes an act of no integrity.</p>
<p>A person who truly scolds people will not bow and scrape. If one scolds people while bowing and scraping, it is not only ridiculous but can also cause trouble. If one is not careful and says "Admire" when one means "Bastard," one will be slapped in the face.</p>
<h3>The Propaganda War in Spain</h3>
<p>— Translated by Fan Ke</p>
<p>Modern technology has created two weapons in addition to the already extensive armory of war. These newest types of munitions, unlike tanks, bombers, or hand grenades, neither kill nor injure. They are aerial leaflet bombs and loudspeakers.</p>
<p>Behind any front line in Spain today, no more than a few yards apart, there is a house or wooden shed, its walls riddled with bullet holes, containing a primitive printing press, not assembled by experts. A soldier bends over the machine, working on it. He has received crash training and knows how to print booklets by the dozens.</p>
<p>The contents of these propaganda items vary greatly; sometimes they are denials of statements from the enemy general staff, promises of a near-heavenly life to soldiers who desert to the other side, and sometimes excerpts from the speeches of famous politicians.</p>
<p>A large aerial leaflet bomb can hold four hundred booklets at a time and is flown over enemy trenches to be distributed. The leaflet bomb comes down from the sky with a crackling sound, trailing a long white plume to the enemy lines, where it explodes. Pale leaflets float to the ground and into the hands of enemy soldiers a minute later. On some days, twenty to fifty leaflet bombs fall in the "no man's land" separating government and rebel forces.</p>
<p>In terms of weapons of war, radio may be even more effective. Various broadcasting tools are available at the front lines, with power supplied by an old-fashioned motor. In the middle of the night, the trenches suddenly resound with a marching tune or a tango, or the melancholic tune of a Spanish folk song. Soldiers crave any kind of entertainment; they listen in silence.</p>
<p>The music suddenly stops, and a voice booms through the night. It is the voice of the enemy, telling the other side that they are fighting on the wrong side, inciting them to rebel and desert, urging them to take advantage of the darkness to escape to the other side, and promising them a wonderful life. They reiterate all of this in every imaginable language.</p>
<p>In recent months, the eclectic field of propaganda work has been greatly modernized. Huge, new propaganda trucks will soon be seen at the front lines, equipped with all the latest mechanical inventions, with both sound broadcasting and receiving capabilities. Equipped with several subwoofers, sometimes as many as fourteen loudspeakers, under cover of darkness, these vehicles drive close to the enemy's front lines, set up the loudspeakers behind strategic positions, and begin broadcasting. (The trucks have chains connected to the loudspeakers.)</p>
<p>Both aerial leaflet bombs and loudspeakers have been successful for both sides in the Spanish war. The enemy's propaganda bombs pass each other in the air over "no man's land," followed by a "paper war." What soldiers find most annoying is both sides broadcasting at the same time. The result is that the voices of both sides cancel each other out, and the speakers of both sides cannot be heard clearly. The sound of the loudspeakers can reach a mile and a half, but the strange intermingling of sounds when both sides broadcast at the same time is enough to drive the people in the trenches crazy.</p>
<p>This is the propaganda war! A fierce war, whether spoken or written, but more welcome than bullets and bombs. (Translated from "National Literary Magazine")</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, everyone bowed their heads in thought, not saying a word. After a while, Regiment Adjutant Liang finally spoke:</p>
<p>"To wipe out this batch of bandits would not be difficult, but to allow the enemy to benefit as a result would be somewhat unworthy, so this matter cannot be resolved by force. I think it's best to use soft tactics, and properly persuade them to reform and start anew."</p>
<p>"I think so too," Regiment Commander Ye nodded and said, "But I'm afraid their wild nature is hard to tame. I've heard that the people within them are very mixed and impure; I'm afraid it will be very difficult to use personal charm to influence them."</p>
<p>"I have a plan here," Staff Officer Zhu suddenly stood up and said, "As the saying goes, 'To catch bandits, first catch the leader.' We might as well first issue a notice, inviting One-Eyed Li to come here for a banquet, and secretly set up an ambush. When he arrives, we'll give a signal by throwing a cup on the table and arrest him. His subordinates are all a ragtag bunch, and 'a snake cannot move without a head,' so at that time, we can reorganize or disband them at our discretion."</p>
<p>"That method is not bad, but the worry is that he may not be willing to be fooled," Regiment Commander Ye said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Whether he comes or not, we might as well try it first. This is called 'courtesy before force.' If he doesn't come, it's not too late for us to devise another plan," Regiment Adjutant Liang also agreed with Staff Officer Zhu's plan, helping from the side.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed with this proposal, so Regiment Commander Ye chose a date, prepared a red invitation, and ordered a soldier to send it to Tiaoxi Town, inviting One-Eyed Li to the banquet. To avoid arousing his suspicion, even his strategist, nicknamed Dog-Headed Advisor Xiao Mazi, was invited.</p>
<p>After sending out the invitations, Regiment Commander Ye did not think that this was the end of the matter, but continued to plan meticulously with Regiment Adjutant Liang and Staff Officer Zhu, how to arrange the ambush, what conditions to propose to One-Eyed Li at the banquet, and even what preparations should be made in the event of failure.

<h3>The Pain of Suffering from Neurasthenia in Married Life</h3>
<p>The happiness of married life, upon careful study, is truly a right unique to healthy people. If any morbid state occurs, it is best to stop the process. If one proceeds with coercion, one cannot avoid experiencing pain. Now, let us take the common neurasthenia as an example. On the surface, neurasthenia may not show any abnormalities at all. Men after marriage are more likely to suffer from this disease, especially those in middle age. The causes are mostly due to early self-indulgence in masturbation or nocturnal emission, or post-marital debauchery and indulgence. In addition, worries and injuries, post-illness imbalances, and congenital weakness may also occasionally occur. As a result, the reproductive gland fluid in the body stagnates or dries up, the metabolic rate decreases, and the nervous system, deprived of adequate nutrition and adjustment, enters a state of weakness. Therefore, on the brain nerve side, there are often headaches, forgetfulness, and insomnia, but in this spring season, it is very tiring and sleepy. The pain of being unable to sleep when one is tired is indescribable! And with a little bit of brain use, one immediately feels golden flowers disturbing one's vision, and the ears sound like jade pendants, sometimes even fainting! On the spinal nerve side, there are often backaches, sore backs, and weakness in the limbs. If one works hard even a little, one feels exhausted and unable to support oneself. As for the sexual nerve side, the symptoms of nocturnal emission, seminal emission upon seeing the opposite sex, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipation of energy, and prolonged infertility appear one after another. Therefore, even in this gentle and warm spring, on clear moonlit nights, how can the married life be harmonious and fulfilling? However, the youth of the beautiful wife is wasted, how can one not feel sad! The small things become the complaints of women in their boudoirs, and there is no joy in the family. The big things become anger and resentment, and they even have affairs and elope with others, or openly meet their husbands in court and eloquently sue for divorce! This kind of husband, suffering such a tragic life, what is the pain in his heart like!</p>
<p>Regarding the effective treatment of the above-mentioned symptoms, it has long been believed by world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience that taking "Reproductive Element," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of strong animals, is the most effective and specific treatment. This agent can produce essence and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, and nourish the nerves within a day and night after taking it, so that the symptoms are immediately reduced. If one can continue to take it, the above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time, and the body will become healthier, with the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating the youth. This drug has also been tested by the famous German doctor (Miller) Meyers, proving that its quality is pure, its medicinal properties are mild, and its tonic effect is active. There are absolutely no side effects such as irritating the stomach and intestines and exciting the nerves after taking it, so it is determined to be the best of endocrine or youth gland preparations. Since its invention, it has been popular all over the world and is praised by all pharmacies. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Heimitu's Essence-Solidifying Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that the effect is even faster. If patients can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors, and then use scientific methods such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, they can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>
<h3>Methods for Shaping Beautiful Breasts, Faces, and Hips</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Health and beauty, I think every woman yearns for and pursues them! Indeed, a healthy and beautiful woman is truly a treasure of society, the soul in the hearts of men, and the mother of the great era to come. If she marries a good man, the love between husband and wife will be deep, they will have clever children, and they will have a happy family. How glorious and happy life is! But how can a woman gain health and beauty? This is a problem that we must urgently solve.</p>
<p>The wheel of the times turns unstoppably, and the concept of feminine beauty has abandoned the hypocritical, delicate, and morbid beauty of the past. Now, the emphasis is on the healthy beauty of developed feminine characteristics. The main of these characteristics are the breasts, the face, and the hips. The development of the breasts and hips, and the rosy and lively complexion, according to medical experts, are due to the sound function of the ovaries and vigorous metabolism. If a woman is unfortunate enough to suffer from irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, inability to achieve orgasm, infertility, or other hidden diseases, the function of the ovaries will be destroyed, and the breasts will not develop well, or if they have already developed well, they will gradually atrophy. The same is true for the hips, and the metabolic rate is reduced. Therefore, the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts are filled with waste materials, and no new cells are produced, so the face becomes withered or pale. Although the age is still young, they are prematurely aging. Such women, in their virgin days, will not be able to choose a good man, and if they have married, the love between husband and wife will inevitably be weak, or even hopeless for childbearing, abandoned by their husbands, and feel that their life is drifting, how sad! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Element" for women to enhance the function of the ovaries and invigorate the metabolism. Not only can the above-mentioned symptoms be completely cured, but also the breasts can be raised, the hips can be developed, the face can be rosy, the muscles can be plump, and the blood can be full and bright red. It is truly the only scientific and good method to cure diseases, prolong life, and improve health and beauty.</p>
<p>Common Diseases of Youth</p>
<p>— Feng Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<h3>Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission are No Different from Cutting off One's Own Vitality</h3>
<p>The most painful thing in life is like, "The falling flowers are sentimental, but the stream is merciless." We have come into contact with thousands of young patients, and we feel that they started with a wrong idea, ignorant of physiology, unaware of the preciousness of their own semen, indulging in masturbation, even cutting it off every day, until later, hundreds of morbid states appear, and the bad consequences have been formed, and when they are about to implement the most precious happiness life, they realize that "the arrow at the end of its flight, even if it penetrates the Lu silk." A steamed bun that has already reached the mouth can only be watched, without the strength to chew it, so they are as anxious as ants on a hot pot, crying and begging people for treatment. However, "holding the Buddha's feet at the last minute," the regret at this time is ultimately too late!</p>
<p>Therefore, the ancients have said, "Be cautious in all things before, and you will regret it later." We should use what we should use, and not use what we should not use in our lives. This is not only true for one thing and one object, but also for physiological needs. For example, married life is the great way of human relations, and it has the mission of procreating the race, improving society, and regulating the body and mind. We should naturally do it, but we must also know where to stop. Too much or too little is harmful. Masturbation is the devil of health and the executioner of happiness. We, the intelligent youth, must not let this kind of mechanical, anti-physiological act of lust touch our bodies, because once this demon touches our bodies, what follows is nocturnal emission. After too frequent nocturnal emission, backaches, sore backs, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, palpitations, dizziness, blurred vision, impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, thin essence, dry essence, prolonged infertility, and other symptoms will inevitably follow one after another. Then your mind will be depressed! Your spirit will be decadent! Your body will be thin! You will be listless all day long, and your splendid future will turn into bubbles! Happiness between the sexes will disappear. Many promising people have been obscured by such encounters, and even resentfully committed suicide!</p>
<p>Don't wait until the day a tragedy befalls you, then you will only have the fate of "regretting it too late when things come to a head." You should now realize your mistake immediately. If you have committed masturbation, you should immediately raise your will, engage in beneficial exercise, and abstain from masturbation. Those who have symptoms such as nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea should especially rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and take four "Heimitu's Essence-Solidifying Tablets," so that the sperm gate will be as solid as a golden soup, and your semen will not flow out. If you have already brewed various symptoms of weakness due to masturbation and nocturnal emission, you should also take "Reproductive Element," a reproductive gland preparation, at the same time. This agent has great medicinal power, and can produce essence and strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain and benefit the marrow within a day and night after taking it. If you can continue to take it and persevere, then even the most weakened body will not be difficult to restore to health in a short period of time.</p>
<p>White Turbidity Forum</p>
<p>— Written by Dai De, Gonorrhea Specialist</p>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Clinic Hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Free consultation, only 40 cents registration fee</p>
<h3>The Key to Easily Curing Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>The condition of white turbid discharge is universally acknowledged as easily contagious and notoriously difficult to eradicate completely. The world knows this to be true but fails to understand the underlying reasons and appropriate treatments. Some rely on chance, while others depend on the heavily advertised medications for white turbid discharge. They often self-administer over-the-counter remedies readily available in the market, unaware that the disease of gonorrhea presents with complex and subtle conditions. It requires sincere learning, extensive experience, the application of scientific methods, and meticulous care. Patients must be aware and should never experiment with medications or treatments on themselves. Since gonorrhea is inherently intricate and delicate, readily available remedies from the market are unlikely to be precisely suitable. Success cannot be expected from those with superficial understanding or medical practitioners with outdated and inadequate facilities who rely on crude procedures and equipment. This is manifestly clear.</p>
<p>Firstly, patients must remember that the pain experienced during acute white turbid discharge is a natural physiological response. Forcibly suppressing it for temporary relief through common analgesic treatments only numbs the nerves and reduces the patient's resistance. Is this not akin to adding fuel to the fire or arming a thief? Therefore, those skilled in treating white turbid discharge prioritize rapid and legitimate eradication during the acute stage of gonorrhea to prevent future syphilis. Otherwise, once the acute phase passes, it becomes chronic, recurring intermittently, with complications such as arthritis, cystitis, orchitis, and prostatitis. Hence, patients should consult experienced physicians during the acute phase and receive rational treatments, such as painless injections using specially made autogenous vaccines, cooling methods, and German Filtr淋平 galvanic therapy. Only then can the gonococci be eliminated, and the patient's resistance increased, leading to a complete cure within one to two weeks, preventing the disease from progressing to the chronic stage. The key to fundamentally resolving white turbid discharge lies in "eliminating the bacteria." Such "bacteria elimination" requires the right methods and cannot be achieved by irresponsible individuals.</p>

<h3>Concurrent Treatment and Recuperation for Non-Critical Illnesses: Treating Hemoptysis</h3>
<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>After contracting an illness, besides seeking medical treatment, one must also implement appropriate recuperation and moderation in terms of daily life, diet, and mental state. This facilitates easier recovery for mild illnesses and reduces the risks of severe ones. Conversely, minor ailments may worsen, and serious conditions may become critical. This applies to all diseases, including hemoptysis. Patients with hemoptysis should consider the following points in addition to medication:</p>
<p>Psychological Recuperation: Upon experiencing hemoptysis, most people feel extreme panic, as if life is immediately threatened. Some mistakenly believe that hemoptysis is a sign of advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, marking the end of their life. This misconception is a major psychological error. It is essential to understand that this condition varies in severity and is not always critical. While hemoptysis can occur during the course of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is not exclusively indicative of it. Patients should avoid panic and anxiety and instead maintain a calm demeanor, firmly believing that medication will be effective and rest will promote recovery.</p>
<p>Prudent Actions: Whether hemoptysis originates from the lungs or the stomach, it is crucial to rest calmly, avoid strenuous activities, limit talking, and refrain from anger. Strenuous activities can damage blood vessels, making it difficult for wounds to heal. Excessive talking leads to excitement and tension in the blood vessels, hindering wound recovery. Anger can cause blood flow to become erratic, increasing blood loss.</p>
<p>Prohibited Items: Alcohol, tobacco, and tea have stimulating effects on the nervous system and should be avoided not only during hemoptysis but also even after initial recovery when blood vessel coagulation is not yet fully solidified. Consuming these stimulating substances can easily lead to recurrence. Additionally, spicy and hot foods such as chili peppers, ginger, red dates, and pepper should also be avoided.</p>
<p>Dietary Therapy: Lotus root is sweet and cooling, capable of cooling the blood and stopping bleeding, including hemoptysis and epistaxis. During significant hemoptysis, drinking freshly squeezed lotus root juice frequently is highly effective. Those with a history of bleeding disorders should consume it regularly. Cooked lotus root soup can harmonize the blood, calm the nerves, and benefit the stomach. Suzhou cooked lotus root also nourishes the lungs. Therefore, this food is an excellent therapeutic choice for hemoptysis. Baiji powder, Sanqi ginseng, and ink also treat hemoptysis because they contain high levels of gelatinous substances that can adhere to ruptured blood vessels, promoting coagulation. They are commonly used in medicine for this purpose.</p>
<h3>Hawthorn Syrup</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiazhen</p>
<p>Careless eating habits or exposure to wind after meals can easily lead to food stagnation, causing digestive dysfunction, resulting in abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms. In such cases, promoting digestion is advisable. The simplest and most effective method is hawthorn syrup. It also stimulates saliva production upon consumption, similar to drinking coffee or tea. It is especially suitable for treating food stagnation in children, who are often reluctant to take medication. Offering them this syrup is sure to please them. The preparation method is detailed below: First, purchase four taels of charred hawthorn powder from a pharmacy, heat it in a pot, add four taels of brown sugar, and simmer in a pot until the sugar dissolves, then simmer for another five minutes before removing. Place in a bowl to form a syrup-like consistency. When using, mix two spoonfuls with boiling water. Hawthorn has a sour and sweet taste that helps increase stomach acid and promote digestion, which is unmatched by other medications. Regularly drinking a small amount of this syrup after meals can prevent various gastrointestinal diseases. Its sweet and delicious taste is similar to that of coffee.</p>
<h3>Overweight and Underweight</h3>
<p>— Chen Zuolei</p>
<p>Being overweight or underweight is not inherently a disease; however, excessive obesity or emaciation is beyond the norm and will soon become a disease. In such cases, weight loss or weight gain is necessary. However, using medication is not advisable. The following are two simple dietary therapies:</p>
<p>Treating Obesity: Regularly drink kelp soup during meals to lose weight and treat obesity. Ancient herbal texts from the Dunhuang caves also record that "kelp lowers qi and prolonged consumption makes one thin." Kelp lowers blood pressure, making it suitable for obese people.</p>
<p>Treating Underweight: Mix bone marrow with Rehmannia juice, white honey, and black sesame seeds to form a powder, then cook into a liquid paste and consume as a snack daily. Although the taste may not be pleasant, it can gradually increase weight and nourish the five internal organs.</p>
<h3>The Affliction of Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>— Xu Jintao</p>
<p>According to statistics from medical practitioners, most hemorrhoid sufferers either reside in damp, low-lying areas, sit all day with little exercise, overwork themselves, or have a predisposition to damp heat, or are accustomed to excessive drinking without moderation, damaging their internal organs and leading to this disease.</p>
<p>Once hemorrhoids develop, bowel movements become uncomfortable and irregular, leading to mental fatigue and decreased work capacity, even causing severe pain and bed rest. The treatment method for painful bowel movements is to moisten dryness and dispel dampness; for anal prolapse pain, clear fire and dispel dampness; for difficulty urinating, clear the liver and guide dampness. For existing fistulas, focus on nourishing the primordial qi, replenishing yin, and cultivating essence. At the same time, special attention should be paid to diet. First, smoking and alcohol must be avoided. Additionally, spicy foods such as chili peppers, garlic, garlic sprouts, scallions, ginger, mud crabs, soft-shelled turtles, blood clams, fish, shrimp, melons, fruits, coffee, sorghum wine, and other irritating foods should no longer be consumed. Otherwise, the disease will worsen, causing increasing pain, financial burden, and harm to the body, leading to unimaginable consequences.</p>
<h3>Eggs and Soybean Milk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Eggs provide the most abundant nutrition, while soybean milk is rich in fatty acids, which can moisturize the stomach and intestines. Every morning, whisk one raw egg into a cup of plain soybean milk and consume it as a snack. The benefits are superior to any tonic. According to a friend who suffered from lung disease, he contracted chronic pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of sixteen or seventeen. He experienced hemoptysis, coughing, fever, night sweats, and loss of voice, with critical symptoms occurring in succession. Medical treatment proved ineffective. Later, he tried this method. After one month, there was no change; after two months, the coughing subsided; after three months, his voice returned. After continuing for six months, all symptoms disappeared. After one year, he transformed into a strong young man. He continued to consume this remedy. Now over fifty years old, symptoms of hemoptysis and coughing have never recurred.</p>
<h3>Brief Notes on Dietary Therapy</h3>
<p>Kumquats Compare to Oranges</p>
<p>Among fruits, people often prefer oranges because they are juicy and sweet. However, there is also a type called kumquat, also known as golden tangerine, or golden egg. It can relieve hangovers, promote digestion, resolve phlegm, and quench thirst. Although its flesh tastes slightly sour, it is beneficial and harmless to consume.</p>
<p>— (Zhang Chun)</p>
<p>Corn Stalks Substitute for Medicine</p>
<p>Take several corn stalks, scrape off the kernels, leaving only the stalks. Bake them on a tile until they turn to charcoal. Separately, bake some tea leaves until charred. Boil them together and drink the decoction to treat colds with headaches. Drink this decoction several times a day, preferably avoiding wind and resting quietly afterward for optimal effect.</p>
<p>— (Wei Siqi)</p>
<p>Homemade Fresh Liver Juice</p>
<p>Take five to six taels of fresh beef or pork liver, repeatedly wash it with boiling water, chop it up, and mix it with an appropriate amount of warm water. Then, strain it through gauze, and drink the juice at once (if you find the fishy smell unpleasant, you can add a little lemon juice or orange juice). It has special effects on neurasthenia and pernicious anemia.</p>
<p>— (Shen Cai Zhi)</p>
<p>Pig Brain Cures Dizziness</p>
<p>For dizziness not caused by external wind-cold but due to upward flare of deficient fire, use two or three pig brains, add scallions, ginger, cooking wine, salt, soy sauce, and other ingredients, steam or pan-fry, and eat. After several times, the condition should improve.</p>
<p>— (Zhang Zhongxian)</p>
<p>Wonderful Remedy for Seminal Emission</p>
<p>Take four qian of Job's tears, one liang each of Hunan lotus seeds and Gorgon fruit, one liang of Huai yam, two qian of jujube seeds, and four qian of Poria cocos (stir-fried). Add some water, put in a porcelain jar, and simmer over charcoal on low heat. Add a little white sugar daily and eat it to treat seminal emission, with miraculous results.</p>
<p>— (Li Chunyi)</p>
<p>Lily Bulb Generally Nourishing</p>
<p>Lily bulbs can calm the nerves and moisten the lungs. Eating more can boost energy, clear the mind. Eating a bowl a day is very nourishing, but the taste is slightly bitter. Add a little white sugar when cooking. It is best to eat this for convalescence after illness.</p>
<p>— (Zhang Lu)</p>
<p>Clams Soften the Liver and Replenish Blood</p>
<p>Tegillarca granosa, commonly known as clams. They are mostly cooked in boiling water, then mixed with ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil before eating. Ancient herbal texts state that this food softens the liver, nourishes the liver, replenishes blood, and strengthens the stomach. The taste is extremely delicious and is truly an unparalleled food for dietary therapy. The shell is also used in medicine, known as tile shavings. Ancient books state that it can treat chronic stomach pain, blood clots, and pain from blood stasis. Are these symptoms not similar to those of stomach cancer and stomach ulcers today? Li Shizhen said that this substance is salty, moves the blood, and softens hardness, so it has miraculous effects on both stomach cancer and stomach ulcers. Mr. Zhang mentioned it in previous issues, but the explanation was incomplete, so I am adding a few words to supplement it.</p>

<h3>Glutinous Rice Flour</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huailin</p>
<p>Glutinous rice flour is used to make dumplings filled with sweet osmanthus and red bean paste or savory winter bamboo shoots and minced meat. They are fragrant, sweet, and delicious, enjoyed by many. However, they are difficult to digest for the elderly and children, often causing stagnation and digestive problems such as loss of appetite, constipation, fever, or dysentery. This phenomenon is very common after the New Year.</p>
<p>The difficulty in digesting glutinous rice dumplings lies in the glutinous rice flour itself. Glutinous rice is very sticky and dense. When ground into flour and mixed with water, it becomes even more sticky and can also ferment. People with weak digestive systems easily experience stagnation. After stagnation, the glutinous rice flour ferments in the stomach, causing stomach acid to overflow and producing a peculiar odor.</p>
<p>To treat indigestion caused by glutinous rice flour, pharmacies sell a product called "rice ash," which is rice that has been stir-fried into charcoal. Swallow two or three qian with boiling water. It can prevent fermentation and absorb moisture, so it is very effective.</p>
<h3>An Inexpensive Treatment: Ginger Stops Vomiting Miraculously</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanqing</p>
<p>Vomiting can be caused by either cold or heat. For heat-related vomiting, bitter and cold medications are needed to promote downward movement of the reverse qi. However, the medicinal properties are difficult to accept without supplementing it with the pungent and warm flavor of ginger. For cold-related vomiting, it is often due to weakness of the spleen and stomach, with cold arising from within, leading to frequent vomiting and inability to eat or drink. It is especially beneficial to eat ginger, which can unblock yang, discharge turbidity, dispel cold, and eliminate filth, often with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Ginger contains volatile oils that stimulate the stomach nerves, increasing stomach secretions and promoting peristalsis. It also stimulates the small intestine and enhances the absorption of the intestinal lacteals, making it a good product for stopping vomiting and strengthening the stomach.</p>
<p>Ginger juice can treat vomiting, as mentioned above. To use it, grind fresh ginger to extract two spoonfuls of natural juice, mix with half a small cup of warm water, and sip frequently in small amounts. Anyone suffering from vomiting that refuses food will often stop vomiting with each sip.</p>
<h3>Dietary Therapy for Critical Illnesses</h3>
<p>— Lu Chengyi</p>
<p>There is a common misconception that dietary therapy is only suitable for minor ailments, such as hemorrhoids and scabies. For diseases that are deep-seated and beyond the reach of medicine, what use are ordinary foods? In fact, when a disease is critical, the stomach is bound to be weak. Most medicines can harm the stomach. Therefore, those who are very ill may vomit and cannot accept medicine. In critical situations, what use is medicine? At this time, slowly regulate the body with foods that please the stomach and are suitable for the condition. The illness will naturally turn for the better. Both medicine and food enter the stomach first, and then all other functions begin.</p>
<h3>Oranges</h3>
<p>— Sun Zonglu</p>
<p>Oranges are a superior fruit. The honey oranges produced in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, are the best in our country, sweet as honey and leaving a fragrant taste in the mouth. Comparing American Florida oranges with honey oranges, one tastes sour and bitter, while the other is as sweet as candy. The difference is clear. Oranges are rich in nutrients and are essential for human nutrition. Peeling and eating an orange after a meal can nourish the body and aid digestion, making it a natural and wonderful product. Also, for those suffering from typhoid fever and other febrile infectious diseases, making juice from several oranges a day can reduce fever and inflammation. It is also a specific medicine for treating scurvy. Eating it can alleviate the disease, and its effect is unmatched by any medicine.</p>
<p>A friend of mine was physically weak, with swollen gums that bled frequently. Later, he drank orange juice every day, and in a few days, his gum swelling subsided, and the bleeding stopped. This disease was caused by a lack of nutrients, which oranges contain in abundance. Therefore, after my friend drank orange juice, his disease was completely cured, which is not surprising.</p>
<h3>Silkie Chicken</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianchu</p>
<p>Chicken can replenish vitality and qi, nourish yin and kidneys, so it is always regarded as a valuable household food. Among chickens, the black-boned chicken is even more valuable.</p>
<p>The black-boned chicken, also known as silkie chicken, is easy to identify. Its foot skin is black or bluish-gray, and its comb is often purple. Its feathers are mostly white, and black ones are even better. It has a sweet taste and warm nature, can replenish yin deficiency, and treat diabetes. For women, it can regulate menstruation and promote conception, stop leukorrhea and unblock menstruation: the market also sells White Phoenix Pills made from black-boned chicken. For adults and children, it can treat dysentery and replenish vitality. Its gizzard, liver, and yellow skin can treat premature ejaculation in young men, bed-wetting in children, and intestinal wind disorders, with unexpected effects. Regular consumption can nourish qi and replenish blood, and regulate various ailments. However, you should choose the male chicken when purchasing, and the blacker the bone, the better.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Product for Treating Swelling</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhongxian</p>
<p>There are many causes of edema, but to summarize, it is nothing more than the disease lying in the spleen and kidneys. But if the edema does not cause umbilical protrusion, back flattening, supraclavicular fossa flattening, sole flattening, lips swollen and black, or scrotum and penis swelling and rot, it is still treatable. In addition to medicine, winter melon and blackfish are most effective for treatment. After washing the winter melon, cut it into slices with the skin, and add dried mussels to cook a soup. If there is no winter melon, use blackfish (also known as black carp or seven-star fish), remove the scales and internal organs, wash it clean, and add garlic to cook a soup. Dried mussels nourish yin and replenish the kidneys. When the kidney qi is sufficient, the spleen will also be healthy and functioning, and water will flow freely. Winter melon promotes urination and leads water downwards. Long-term consumption will naturally show effects. Blackfish supports the spleen and promotes urination. Garlic strengthens the spleen and stomach, treats kidney qi, and opens orifices to promote urination. When the two are combined, they treat both the spleen and kidneys. However, neither should add oil or salt, as adding oil or salt will negate their diuretic effect, and there will be no effect.</p>

<h3>Money</h3>
<p>— Ren Yong</p>
<p>The Bible says: "The love of money is the root of all evil." Although this sentence emphasizes the word "love," which implies insatiable greed, the lines also suggest that "money" is contemptible. As the root of evil, "money" seems to bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>Disdain for wealth has always been a common characteristic of self-proclaimed noble literary scholars, both in China and abroad, ancient and modern. Ancient Chinese people were ashamed to talk about "money," calling it "A Du's object," thinking there could be no greater nobility.</p>
<p>But in reality? What crime has "money" committed to be so despised? Frankly, who in this world can escape it? Even in the future, no matter how developed and sound the credit system becomes, money will still exist abstractly. Why should we regard disdain for wealth as nobility? We live in a utilitarian world; rights and obligations must be clearly distinguished. Zheng Banqiao once said well behind his painting fees: "It is always better to send silver than gifts or food; what the public sends may not be what the brother likes. Sending cash brings joy to the heart, and the paintings are all good. Gifts are sources of dispute, and debts are often unpaid. Old and tired, I will not waste time making useless conversation with gentlemen." This direct, straightforward, and candid tone is what makes Banqiao superior.</p>
<p>So money should not be despised, nor does it need to be despised, because "money itself is innocent." It depends on the person.</p>
<p>Traitors hoard wealth to provide for their children, grandchildren, and concubines to squander. In this case, money is indeed too despicable. But we have also seen people pull out their gold teeth to donate to the government; accumulate a day's worth of shoe-shining money to donate to the government; countless anonymous Mr. So-and-Sos are generously providing relief to refugees in the newspapers. In this case, money seems to be worthy of praise. The same Central Bank note can be either fragrant or foul, with endless variations. But we must recognize that it is passive. The key lies entirely with the person.</p>
<p>So I want to speak up for money. People should not manipulate money themselves and then blame it for the evil. From now on, our view of money must change: money itself is pure, but people have dyed it with various colors and added fragrances and foul juices. We don't need to scold money as A Du's object. On the contrary, we should control ourselves, not earn money from shamelessness, and not waste money on meaninglessness. We should exchange our conscience and sweat for money and use it for valuable purposes. Then money becomes supremely noble and worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>On "Friends' Day"</h3>
<p>— Xueliang</p>
<p>The proverb says, "All within the four seas are brothers." Another proverb says, "Rely on your parents at home, rely on your friends when you're away from home." It is evident that friends are indeed necessary for us humans. For this reason, Mr. Huang Jingwan initiated the designation of March 3rd of each year as China's Friends' Day, to unite individuals, in the purpose of personality equality, to do more beneficial business, and to seek human happiness. Time flies so fast, it is already the sixth Friends' Day since the inception; Like Women's Day, Children's Day, etc., Friends' Day is also the most celebrated and commemorated, especially in the warm and sunny spring, and friendly time.</p>
<p>As proven by the facts, Friends' Day is indeed worthy of promotion and expansion; especially in the current time of grave national crisis, it needs to be promoted to make every stranger, every person without emotion, become warm, thereby firmly uniting to create a solid collective, which is helpful and beneficial to the ongoing war of resistance.</p>
<p>The brutal invaders have trampled on our countless fine lands; they killed our countless beloved and kind compatriots; when Friends' Day comes, thinking of this scene, sadness inevitably arises in our hearts. They are also "people," we are also "people," why do they have to encounter such hardship? Why can we only safely enjoy ourselves on an isolated island? The purpose of Friends' Day is to call on us to bear some basic responsibility, not just chant high-sounding words and slogans, and call it over. Although we cannot shoulder guns and go to the front line to kill the enemy happily, we must, after all, do some charity work, promote savings for disaster relief, and try to use domestic goods... Is this not a way to love the country and save the country?</p>
<p>Friends with money should know the plight of those poor and unfortunate friends around you, and try to help them as much as possible, whether material or spiritual, everything is needed. Poor friends in difficult circumstances should not be disappointed and decadent, sigh in despair, and adopt a negative attitude; we must know that everything depends on human effort. As long as we all cheer up, encourage each other, work hard, and strive, nothing will not be successful!</p>
<p>The past Friends' Days do not seem to have been satisfactory in this regard; however, starting from this year's Friends' Day, I believe that there will be great achievements. All friends, including all old, young, male, female, rich, poor, knowledgeable, and illiterate, let's all cheer up, let's all unite, and under the great purpose of personality equality, saving for disaster relief, loving the country and saving the country, everyone is preparing for new efforts and new forces to create the glorious history of future China.</p>
<p>On this year's Friends' Day, we cannot and cannot bear to celebrate wildly, but we hope that when next year's Friends' Day comes, everyone, every compatriot, that is, every friend, will be able to celebrate and commemorate as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Continued Discussion on Cigarette Cards</h3>
<p>— Li Xiaoyong</p>
<p>When it came to China's Nanyang region, cigarette companies like Hua Cheng rose up, and the market share of various foreign cigarette companies was largely taken over, recovering quite a few rights and interests. Nanyang Hua Cheng mainly produced landscapes and embroidered portraits (i.e., Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Investiture of the Gods, etc.), Hardman specialized in drama, Hua Cheng specialized in fashionable beauties, and the cards produced by other cigarette merchants were all crudely made and mostly of low-grade taste. During this period, most cigarette cards were of no value.</p>
<p>Later, Red Tin Package cigarettes came out with a series of famous women of past dynasties (such as Yang Guifei, Cao Dajia, Hongyan, etc.) with brief biographies on the back. Following this, Hua Cheng's Golden Mouse brand produced characters from "Dream of the Red Chamber," with gold trim and poetic commentary on the back. After that, they also produced Beijing Opera Ugly Figure Cartoons, etc. Nanyang Da Lian Zhu included new costumes, and the "Shuobu" series included "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Seven Heroes and Thirteen Gallants," as well as brief biographies of famous generals of past dynasties (with extremely concise biographies on the back). Zijinshan brand produced Three Kingdoms characters, with gold trim and poetic commentary on the back. Sitaphay brand produced Red Border Seven Swords and Thirteen Gallants, etc. During this period, the cigarette cards produced by various cigarette merchants mostly drew from "Shuobu," and the colored cards with explanations on the back of the "Nanyang Water Margin" were extremely beautifully drawn. Each batch of new cards that came out was eagerly bought by collectors from card dealers, sparing no expense to get them first. Unfortunately, after more than forty episodes, totaling about three hundred cards, the artist changed, and the printing quality also declined. The Nanyang-produced series of famous generals of past dynasties was always considered the most suitable for educating the public, promoting national glory, and inspiring the spirit of the people. In short, during this period, the cigarette cards produced by Nanyang Company held a leading position.</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the number of cigarette factories in China increased, and cigarette cards also came in various styles. Fuxin Company's Pyramid cigarettes came out with a series of realistic pictures of the Battle of Shanghai, which was most welcomed by all walks of life. This shows a glimpse of the psychology of the masses in China at that time.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated using cigarette cards to popularize folk education, which is indeed a matter worthy of attention. Many foreign tobacco companies produce a kind of practical small craft picture cards to educate people about production, which is a very good intention. There are also many companies that produce a kind of picture cards specifically introducing emerging theories, which shows the importance that foreign people attach to cigarette cards now. During this long period of China's war of resistance, how should cigarette merchants use picture cards to help the country promote justice, so that they can look at foreign cigarette merchants without shame? Now that Shanghai cannot depict the heroic resistance of the soldiers at the front line on picture cards, at least it must achieve the degree of educating the public. (The End)</p>
<h3>Nine Twists of a Tender Heart</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>“The Young in Heart”</p>
<p>After watching "Nine Twists of a Tender Heart," I felt that this story was too sad! A woman named Ellen Fortune, who had an old friend leave her a lot of money and a residence in London, and who could travel around to dispel the sadness of her later years, how much she longed for the vitality of youth! This kind of sadness stored in her heart, by chance, she met Anthony's family. When Leacher and Zhu Zhi'anni's youthful vitality appeared in front of her, painful memories made her inexplicably feel good about Anthony's family. She wanted to find the shadows of Dick (her old friend) and herself in these young people. "The Young in Heart" unfolds such a sad story.</p>
<p>Probably due to the decision of the script content, the director's handling of this story adopted an unusually slow tone; and the whole film from beginning to end describes the trivial daily life of Anthony's family, so orderly, like a sailboat sailing on a calm sea, steadily reaching its destination. This sketching style does have its special achievements, but it also immerses the audience under the screen in painful memories. Then, the vitality of youth encouraged by "Nine Twists of a Tender Heart" may also have the opposite effect: at least that's what I personally think.</p>
<p>The director's quiet and humorous style naturally has his artistic achievements. For example: he introduced the four characters of Anthony's family at the beginning, and he clearly portrayed the four outlines ideal in the playwright's mind, and all the way to the end, he always firmly grasped their personalities. What's more, in every detail, he made them active on the screen very humorously and satirically. For example: After Anthony's family was driven out, they huddled on the street, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony sang, Leacher and Zhu Zhi lay on the street cleaner's cart, after arriving in London, the father and son looked at the crane, Anthony was a car salesman: Leacher's drunkenness, etc., all fully showed the vivid image of these four characters.</p>
<p>In terms of actors: Lauren Yang's father, Pipa Burke's mother, Little Fan Bank's brother, Jenny Gaynor's sister, and Mary Turley's Ellen Fortune all played their acting skills separately.</p>
<h3>After the Rain Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Spring Arrives at Bilo Fragrance Floating on Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Full at Li Lake</p>
<p>Now, on Mount Lengjia, a very good Chinese-style house has been built, and that house is called the Stone Lake Academy. The name of this academy has a long history in China. There were academies in the Song Dynasty. The academy was also like today's universities and middle schools, and there were also scholars studying there. The person in charge of the academy was formerly called Shanzhang, who was hired by the local government to be a local Confucian scholar. Suzhou originally had several academies, and every month they would issue questions for the old test, and those with excellent writing would also be awarded a stipend. Since the schools were established, the academies were abolished, but why is there a Stone Lake Academy now? Isn't this restoring the old and reversing the car? No! To say that the term academy is ancient, then the term school is even more ancient. In fact, this academy is somewhat different from the past. It is not a place for scholars to study, but a place for a group of old and learned scholars to study and write. There are classicists, historians, textual critics, lyricists, and poets, and painters in it. In short, China's inherent old learning is gathered in it. Although the people inside are not limited to Suzhou people, Suzhou people account for the majority. Because Wu Zhong is prosperous in literature and history, and has been praised since the dynasties, and Suzhou has always been home to a large number of leisurely people, commonly known as "xieyi friends." Xieyi friends are best at studying this kind of learning. Don't underestimate that Stone Lake Academy, at least fifty or sixty kinds of works are published by the Stone Lake Academy every year! These books are published by a Shanghai library, which has a special agreement. The authors receive royalties, but this royalty is jointly owned by the academy. Because those old gentlemen are paid a monthly salary by the academy, which is very generous, and they are mostly over fifty or sixty years old, and they are indifferent and quiet, they don't want to greedy for any extra profits, and they don't need them to support their families, so they are willing to give the royalties to the public. At first, the number of books published was small, and the annual income was not much. Later, the number of books published increased, and this royalty was really considerable. They jointly discussed taking a sum of money from this royalty to collect ancient prints and reward woodcuts, etc., which is 10,000 yuan per year. Other expenses of the Stone Lake Academy are covered by other funds, and there is no need for it to seek elsewhere. The obscene temple, where cow ghosts and snake gods and female witches used to be superstitious and worshipped, has now become a place where those old gentlemen with gray hair and eyebrows study, develop, write books and establish theories. It is really a world of difference. Only Wu Sujun has been to this Stone Lake Academy. She said: She has an uncle who is also a textual critic and lives in the academy. She has visited him several times. (50)</p>

<h3>On Laughter in Kun Opera (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yan Hongxiang Yuanzhu</p>
<p>The length ratio of each note of the Dan's laughter is opposite to that of the Sheng, with a ratio of one to two to three, and the size ratio is also the same. As for the reason for the opposite, the laughter of men is unrestrained, erupting suddenly, so it goes from large to small; the laughter of women is due to the psychology of shame, not daring to laugh openly, enduring it again and again until it is unbearable, so it is like a water break that collapses the embankment, so in the past it was from small to large. "Dream of the Red Chamber" writes the laughter of women as "bubbler," which is quite wonderful, and can also prove that it starts from small to large.</p>
<p>The Jing's laughter is mostly "yixixi, yixi, yixi, yixi hahaha," and its length and cadence can now be expressed in Western musical notation as follows: (using two-four time)</p>
<p>yixixi | yixi— | xixi hahaha | ha. ||</p>
<p>Angry laughter is mostly performed by the Sheng, and its sound is as follows:</p>
<p>Aha ah, ha— | hehehe | he. ||</p>
<p>The clown's cheerful laughter with humor is shown as follows:</p>
<p>Ai, yo— | hahaha | ha.</p>
<p>The word "ai" is pronounced like the word "ai," and it must be light and fast. The word "yo" is pronounced in the lower level tone, and it must be raised, emphasized, and lengthened. The word "ha" is like the laughter of the Sheng. If you don't believe it, try to learn it according to this, and you will have a wonderful understanding.</p>
<p>The Dan's laughter should always be light and easy, and the Tie should be charming and clever. As for the laughter of sickness and madness, it may be slightly heavier.</p>
<p>(3) Gestures: The Sheng's laughter, either with both hands flipping and crossing each other in a very happy state, or slightly raising one arm and waving its sleeves with the sound of laughter, mostly opening its mouth. As for angry laughter, it often strokes its beard with one hand and points its finger with the other, glaring and gnashing its teeth, pointing and laughing.</p>
<p>The Dan and Tie's laughter, either with hands crossed, or clapping hands, or not using hands to express it, but mostly covering the mouth with a kerchief is the key element, see "Nao Xue," "Jia Qi," "Ji Jian," "Shuo Qin," "Hui Hua," and other dramas.</p>
<p>The Jing's laughter, either with hands open as if embracing something in the air, chest out, head slightly raised, and then shaking the body with the sound of laughter, such as in "Shan Men," or holding the beard with both hands, looking left and right, and shaking the face upwards, such as in "Hua Dang," "Gong Yan," "Bei Zha," and other dramas.</p>
<p>The Wai and Mo's laughter is like the Sheng's. If wearing a sable and gauze hat, the hat wings must be shaken, but not too much, and especially avoid vulgarity. The clown's laughter often has no special gestures. The square scarf is sometimes flipped and crossed with both hands (faster than the Sheng's laughter), then nodding, and moving the chest. Making these two gestures will fully describe its frivolous, dry, and crazy air.</p>
<p>Pretended laughter, regardless of Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, or Chou, is the same as cheerful laughter and smiling laughter. The point that allows the audience to distinguish it is another special expression. This special expression, either with sleeves blocking the face, or hitting the back bow, or making an angry appearance, or a funny appearance. Sheng, such as in "Lian Huan Ji's" small banquet, Dan, such as in "Ci Hu," Chou, such as in "Tou Ji," The Jing of Ge Zhao, then does not block sleeves, does not hit the back bow, only straightens the crown, fastens the belt, and strokes the beard, making a majestic appearance, which is also a special case of pretended laughter.</p>
<h3>Regarding Norma Shearer, She is Truly an Excellent and Progressive Star and a Model for Chinese Actresses</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Norma Shearer is undoubtedly the greatest and most successful actress in Hollywood today. Her superb acting skills in "Their Own Desire," "Smilin' Through," and "Marie Antoinette," who wouldn't envy her, praise her, and admire her? In recent days, Reuters' Hollywood telegram said that she was seriously ill, and every movie fan who cares about ladies couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. Now, let me write down the history of the lady's lifelong struggle and dedicate it to you readers.</p>
<p>Serious Life</p>
<p>Ms. Norma was born in Montreal, Canada on August 10, 1904. She is almost thirty-five years old. She does not follow the customs of ordinary actresses, and does not have love affairs all day and night: her life is always serious, excellent, and quiet. She is a virtuous wife, a good mother, and also an excellent actor: the reason why she has achieved today's success is precisely because of this quiet and clear life.</p>
<p>The Idea of Drama</p>
<p>As early as her childhood, Ms. Norma liked the things on the stage. She began to hope that she would become a big star in the future, and dreamed that one day she would achieve great success. When she was sixteen or seventeen years old, her thoughts were focused on the news of drama. As long as she saw that a theater was putting on a play, she would definitely take some free time out of her busy schedule to rush to see it to her heart's content. At this time, the things she was most happy to read were good scripts, drama reviews, and other books.</p>
<p>The Golden Age</p>
<p>Norma Shearer also believes that a female child must have a beautiful face, good performing talent, and sufficient knowledge to be considered outstanding: therefore, she also pays attention to her business. Later fame, more than half may also rely on this belief. Mary Pickford began to show herself on the screen at the age of fifteen—the period of fifteen or sixteen years old is the most beautiful golden period for every woman! Norma Shearer also wanted to succeed in a career like Mary in this period, and be welcomed and loved by the public.</p>
<p>Determined Struggle</p>
<p>These hopes, these dreams, finally made her leave that quiet and simple Montreal City and come to the luxurious and prosperous New York City; wanting to realize her ideals in this metropolis of the times. However, at this time, she seemed to have not yet met "Lucky Star." She only worked in a public library, and the travel expenses she brought with her were almost used up, and her dear mother left her and returned…… But, what she had was only a determined will. Indeed, after a lot of twists and turns and tribulations, she finally had the opportunity to enter the photography studio and step into the door of the film industry that she had always dreamed of. Since then, she has been willing to work hard and constantly strive for success, and her success has established a solid foundation among the broad audience.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer is indeed a great red star. As long as we look at her past history of struggle and the high position she now stands in, we can easily know. Finally, let us hope that her throat disease can be cured soon, and do not let the disease demon entangle her.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Opera Must Be Improved</h3>
<p>— Shao Huaizong</p>
<p>Shanghai opera has a large audience because its lyrics are popular and can match the psychology of the general public in society. If you are wandering on the road, the clear and pleasant Shanghai opera lyrics broadcast from the store's wireless electricity are enough to make you linger and forget to return: in the Shanghai opera venues in the amusement park, there are always crowds of people, and there is no space to sit. It can be seen that Shanghai opera is welcomed by the public.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai opera is so welcomed by the public, then how should Shanghai opera artists know how to encourage themselves and work hard to improve, so as not to fail the expectations of the social masses, and to fulfill their responsibilities as a member of the nation in this extraordinary period. But what makes people feel extremely sad is the inferiority of its scripts. What we hear every day are always some private agreements between men and women, flirtatious jokes, and the despicable and corrupt tunes such as hooking up and being adulterous. Performances of scripts that praise loyalty and contain national defense significance are as rare as phoenix feathers.</p>
<p>The performance of despicable and vulgar operas has a profound impact on the corruption of social atmosphere. Unknowingly, the spirit of the masses is declining day by day: who still thinks of the motherland in the current moment of life and death, who still thinks of the importance of the responsibility of a member of the nation? Undoubtedly, this will directly poison the public and indirectly hinder the national policy of long-term resistance. How can wise Shanghai opera artists bear it in their hearts?</p>
<p>Now is the great era of the Chinese nation's life and death resistance, and every Chinese is a member of the warrior. If anyone's behavior is contrary to the resistance, they will inevitably be criticized and abandoned by the masses: In the past, wasn't the Shanghai film industry reprimanded by a group of writers for producing bizarre monster movies? The overturned cart in front is a warning to the cart behind: I hope that Shanghai opera practitioners will repent. From now on, perform more scripts that are beneficial to the world and people's hearts and contain national defense significance. This is a great fortune for the public, and also a great fortune for the country!</p>

<h3>Ginkgo Biloba with Twin Stems</h3>
<p>— Lao Kai</p>
<p>Shi Yinhua and Tu Xinghua are leaders of Yue Opera performers, and are currently performing at the Greater China Theater. The market has the so-called name of Ginkgo Biloba with Twin Stems. Yinhua starts as Huashan, and Xinghua starts as Xiaosheng. The singing, gestures, stage steps, recitation, and enunciation of Ginkgo Biloba can be just right. Their joint masterpieces, such as "Ten Beauties Picture," "The Sorrowful History of Liang Zhu," "The Injustice of the Fragrant Handkerchief," "The Magnificent Fate," and "The History of the Three Beauties," have all been warmly praised by the audience. The above picture is their costume.</p>

<p>You Can't Eat Theatre Food Without Becoming an Apprentice</p>
<p>The following year, I went to Beiping again, and the company was willing to pay 150 yuan to invite Wang to re-record. When I met Wang, I asked him impolitely: "Since you have such abilities, and you are also suffering from economic difficulties, then why don't you officially go to sea to eat theatre food?" He was very emotional when he heard my words, and said: "How easy is this matter to talk about? Insiders squeezing out outsiders is too fierce. But to be honest, it's also my own fault. I shouldn't have relied on my talent and pride to write new lyrics and completely overwhelmed their insider clowns, so I ended up being unable to get started. I will never be able to eat theatre food." At that time, I was very surprised when I heard it, so I asked him what was going on? So he told me the whole story: "On the Double Ten Festival of the Republic of China in 1925, Lu Zhang (Zongchang) invited all the Ping Jiao to Jinan to sing to celebrate the National Day. At that time, Yang Xiaolou, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Wang Fengqing, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Li Wanchun, Wang Changlin, Qian Jinfu, etc., all the famous actors in Beiping, all went to Jinan, Shandong, and the Railway Hotel was completely chartered as a place for the opera troupe to stay. It can be said to be an unprecedented grand event. Since the Republic of China, it has been a very rare grand gathering. Because I had a few rich friends in the military and political circles, they also let me string a play called "Huazi Picking Gold." When I didn't go on stage, I first compiled a large section of "Dry Board" (Dry Board means that the clown reads without the accompaniment of the erhu, only with the board), praising the achievements of Grand Marshal Zhang (Zuolin) and Lu Zhang Zhuzhu (Yupu). This section is as many as several hundred sentences, not only rhyming, but also there are several sentences that make them happy. At that time, Zhang Hanqing was sitting high on the large sofa chair at the mouth of the stage, accompanied by Zhang Zhu on the left and right. They could hear every word in their ears. Their subordinates, (from brigade commander to military commander, because the governor's office has limited space, so all are senior generals, and their families and guards, etc.) heard me praising their old marshal and Zhang Changtui, and they all applauded and welcomed them. Even these three generals were so happy that they leaned forward and backward and clapped their hands vigorously. As soon as the play was finished, 500 yuan of reward was immediately issued, saying that Governor Zhang was happy and rewarded. In this way, Wang Changlin, Ma Fulu, Ci Ruiquan, Xiao Changhua, Cao Ergeng Ru Fuhui and other clowns in the backstage were all driven crazy. "</p>
