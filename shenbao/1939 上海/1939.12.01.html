<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際公允之原則與仲裁</h3>
<p>國際不安，何以若今之甚？中日　交戰矣，英法德旣交戰矣，殺戮可謂殘酷，影響可謂慘烈，而趨勢所示，則允任何人感覺危機四伏，一觸即發，方來禍患之普遍深刻，益有遠逾於此數國之交戰者。循是演進，詎知底止。意者，終於無一國一族，無匹夫匹婦爲例外，將使大地爲一洪鑪，作一次總淸算；於是或判決人類罪孽之深重，卒同歸毀滅，或證明正義力量之偉大，得奠定文明。若日不然，殺戮如何始告中止，危機如何始得消弭？危機不絕。殺戮無已，福人安在？樂土安在？夫豈無病呻吟，危辭聳聽？希特勒以立錐無地之人、倔起行伍，不二十年而舉國際的章歐陸和平一手毀之，謂他洲他國必不產生梟桀如希特勒耶？蘇聯得以其列甯格勒城之安全爲藉口，指稱弱小之鄰國爲威脅爲侵略，片面廢棄協訂之互不侵犯條約，以斷絕外交關係拒不接受答復，以干涉對方內政，提示改組政府爲和平之要挾；立國必有昆鄰，國勢必殊强弱，推蘇聯之論據，欲圖兼併，何患無辭？西鄰芬蘭讓步，則更責南鄰羅馬尼亞以威脅與侵略將何如？芬蘭滅亡，則瑞典更爲之西鄰；瑞典不幸，則挪威又爲之西鄰，委屈則危機不絕。抗拒則殺戮無已；擴展無止境，國際無安寗，謂非總淸算，如何得了局！</p>
<p>茲作是說，非謂中日英注德交戰之不足，而世界亟應作史大規模之戰爭：但以爲人類倘不失爲理智之動物，則不應坐視一切演變之自然發展，而陷大地爲洪鑪！今日應不問國族之大小强弱，應不問其人皮膚之有色無色，必須徵詢其眞實之意願：不恤同歸毀滅乎？抑將協力奠定文明乎？集文明者爲一團，相的爲祟尙文明而接受國際公允之原則，甚且必須準備爲奠定文明而償付必要之代價；息戰事，息爭議，蘄求公允之原則為之排難解紛。例如英法德之間，摩擦折衡，歷有年所，終至於今日之戰爭狀態；當其未戰之日，五口人固未聞雙方試覓公允之原則，至少亦未聞雙方自正面否認任何原則；相與周旋者，各自執持其所宗信而已：宗信必分是非皂白，然各自爲主宰而未嘗求直於仲裁：及其旣戰，仲裁機會遂告消逝。例如蘇聯與芬蘭，危機一髮：美國國務卿赫爾氏之談話，表示願爲斡旋，雙方至昨晚止，尙無表示，但據芬蘭方面所傳。則蘇聯有已拒絕斡旋之說；誠使拒絕斡旋，勢又無可仲裁，雖然，竊以爲崇尙文明者之集爲一體，未可因噎廢食：方今漩渦以外之各國族，固應急起直追，確立公允之原則，共矢信守；即如中日英法德蘇芬諸國，凡願接受公允原則，接受國際仲裁者，亦不必顧及對方如何態度，儘可率先表示；則未經對方同意之日，雖無從實現仲裁，然亦足以促進公允原則之確立，倡導國際仲裁之運用者也。况國際隱伏之危機，較諸業已爆發者爲允多：蘇芬方爭於北歐，顧不聞中歐之風雲乎？羅馬尼亞外長茄芬哥氏隔昨纔稱頌顧脫利亞農條約之公道，聲明現狀不容更張；而匈牙利外長査基氏昨即指斥此的爲不公，亟須修正，否則喀爾巴阡山脈之安甯和平，雌期確保云。羅匈未必遽爾短兵相接，然激盪之餘，誰能保證星火之必不燎原。原蓄意侵略之外，交戰必出於萬不得已；始以爭議，爭議告訴無門，於是交鬨交戰；若今日之羅匈二國者，爭議焦點在於顧脫利亞農條約之公道與吾：究其實際，羅國謂公者公乎？匈國爲不公者不公乎?此而漫無標準，人類乃理智動物之謂何？爭議而取決於交鬨交戰,人類文明之謂何？誠得崇尙文明之國族相合作，確立公允原則，而羅匈兩國復能相的奠定文明，則至少中歐糾紛之一環,可望消弭者也。歐戰爆發迄，整三月，三月之中，暴露野蠻，威脅文明之新敎訓不一而足；殷鑒當前　人羣之自審負有奠定文明之責任者，其無不瞿然於文明之未可不勞而獲歟？僥倖於不勞而獲，行見大地以鐵血爲總淸算之來臨！</p>
<h3>南寧東北有激戰　中日各調援軍佈陳地　最激烈決戰卽將實現</h3>
<p>重慶　據此間消息靈通之觀察家語人、中日戰爭中最激烈之決戰、不久或將在桂省叢山中實現、自日軍佔據南寗、截斷中國與越南之公路交通後、中日兩軍均已趕調援軍佈置陣地、準備大戰、據北海消息、大批日軍已在該地登陸、馳往南寗、又據桂南華方軍訊、謂日軍現繼續分三路向西·北·及東北方面推進、主力沿桂南主要公路向賓陽進攻、聞南寗東北之巴塘附近現有激戰、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>列強一致助華　爭取最後之勝利　英大使聲明未作任何協商　日施放外交烟幕均告失敗</h3>
<p>自上月十五日駐華英國大使寇爾爵士由渝抵滬後、外間遂有種種之揣測、謂寇氏此來、即將與日方當局、商談中國問題、然僅屬臆測、昨經大中社記者歷訪此間權威外國外交界曁密切注視遠東局勢之觀察家、業經證實、其允足一掃疑雲者、厥爲英大使所作之明確表示、據寇氏聲稱、「余最近並未進行與第三國在華代表、作重要之商談，」寇爾大使之聲明、昨經此間外交界證實、同時外交界方面並指出、今後第三國與日本間對華關係之關鍵、其重要性實大部繫與華盛頓、</p>
<p>一切傳說英均否認</p>
<p>按、在上週之間、日本方面有數項　言、實使外交界方面深起注視與疑慮、其一說爲寇爾大使業已或即將與日本當局討論範　廣泛之重要問題是也、此間外人方面之意見、以爲此種會議、如果舉行、則深堪扼腕、　以英國旣有事於歐洲，則對於在華之權益、或將作暫時之放棄、然此種迹象、毫無可尋、蓋東京方面曾有報道、謂英國願將天津英租界內華方存銀交出、以爲換取日本封鎖津英租界之解除、但此項傳說、立經此間英國當局予以否認矣、爰於此事發生之前、日本報紙對日本特使加藤之禮儀的拜會寇爾大使、大事煊染、但旋經英日雙方正式聲明、並未涉及重要問題之討論、</p>
<p>日本施放外交烟幕</p>
<p>此間時論家指出、日本報紙對於日方外交之發展、通常稍消息　通、惟今次對於英日兩使之令人注意、然細察則不値一哂者、是爲日方報紙以及若干日方所支持之華文小報、於上週報吿一消息、稱英法日三國使節、將在北平會商美國對日加以壓力之意義、曁應付之力法、記者昨日聆取此間美國及其他外國商業界之意見、咸以爲過去兩星期間、日方之所爲者、僅為施放外交烟幕、蓋以最近美國朝野、對日本侵犯第三國在華淪陷區中之權益所作之壓力之表示、實有迅速之發展、於是日方遂散播空氣、淆人視聽、</p>
<p>日兵不撤抗戰到底</p>
<p>上周有外國觀察家游渝返滬、述其觀感稱重慶方面均以爲除非實現中國之立塲、則任何「和平」條件、均非中國所能接受、該觀察家復稱、湘北戰事之大捷、已更見堅定中國政治之統一、復更强化蔣委員長所表示「日兵在中國一日、中國即抗戰一日」之主張、因此之故、英法對華之政策、雖在歐戰發生之後、並無意外之變化、抑且此時縱欲干涉中國、亦無此可能、</p>
<p>列強對日一致譴責</p>
<p>此間外國外交界權威方面、昨日均表示相信協的國方面、除依一貫之政策、全面支持中國外、此項態度之確當無移、可自華盛頓方面屢决對日所作之聲明、以及美國大多數報章雜誌所發之興論證明之、美國之公意與政策、非惟因著名之「穴百件抗議」遭日本延不解決所致、更因在華淪陷區中第三國一般商業地位　仗義執詞、惟此間外交界方面復指陳、由於列强一致對日譴責、而鼓勵美國之對日加以壓迫、遂迫使日本接近蘇聯結果將使第三國受損更大、其實亦係不必要之鰓鰓過慮」、</p>
<h3>第二批分幣券　已定八日發行　將視市面需要逐漸配發　庫存輔券亦已儘量兌換</h3>
<p>中中交農四行爲救濟滬市輔幣券缺乏恐慌、商妥臨時補救辦法後、各行已將庫存新舊輔幣券儘量發兌、並由中央銀行上海分行趕印一分·五分·分幣券、以代替輔幣券行使、今已決定八日起發行、採用逐漸發行制度、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>庫存輔券儘量發兌</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行庫存新輔幣券三白五十萬元、業已如數發兌完竣、並將前收回之二角五分券重行發出、中國農民銀行已將庫存之五角券、儘量發兌、以發行完竣爲止、浙江地方銀行及江蘇農民銀行、已將前收回之舊輔幣券、予以整理、將完整之券、重行發出、以資流通、消除過去之缺乏恐慌、所以滬市之輔幣券缺乏恐慌、漸吿解決、連日各　因正當需要、向各行兌換者、甚爲擁擠、</p>
<p>二批分券發行有期</p>
<p>爲根本救濟輔幣劵缺乏起見、由中央銀行上海分行電請總行委託美商永寗公司、鉅量印製一分·五分·分幣券、允以五分券爲最好、業經總行批准、與永寗公司訂立承印合同、並將已印竣之分幣券、隨時解交中央銀行上海分行、該行頃已決定、凖本月八日（星期五）起、開始發行、視市面之需要、採用逐漸發行制度、並以五分券代替輔幣券之用、聞中央銀行上海分行對分幣券之發行、已準備就緒、</p>
<p>兌換辦法業已規定</p>
<p>關於分幣券之發行辦法、昨據新聲社記者向中央銀行上海分行探悉、凡滬市金融界銀行業公會會員銀行·及錢業公會會昌錢莊、以及各大公司·與各大商店、如因業務上正當需要分　券時、可向中央銀行兌換、由該行審査、認爲合格、儘量供給之、並規定領用分幣券者、不得貯藏牟利、對於小錢店及烟兌店、此次決定暫行停止供給、因據報過去有若干小錢莊與烟兌店、故意囤積貼水買賣、</p>
<p>慎勿儲藏影響民生</p>
<p>新聲社記者又向銀行界探悉、各銀行在上海發行之輔幣券流通市上者、爲數頗鉅、就鎳銅輔幣而言、總共有二千七百四十六萬六千一百八十元八角、在今日之上海市塲上、幾吿絕跡、所以今日之突吿缺乏、中中交農四行、亦不明其緣因何在、故顯有人利用環境、播弄牟利、今四行已商妥根本救濟辦法、所以缺乏恐慌之嚴重性、即可完全消滅、惟希望各界嗣後愼勿儲藏牟利、以免影響滬市人民生計、</p>
<p>蘇聯對華繼續援助</p>
<p>觀察家均信蘇聯對日本在華之「聖戰」、均不願予以協助、除非日本能付出可驚之代價、而且即使日本承認蘇聯巨大之要求、蘇聯對中國國民政府之援助與鼓勵、仍將賡續不斷、當　之時、日本動盪不定於接受美國要求與懇乞蘇聯支持二者政策之間、而其陸軍則分佈於歷史上未有之遼闊戰綫間、國內經濟、復因海陸軍事之行動而陷於日困一日之窘境、因此種種論據、昨日某第三國領袖觀察家向大中社記者所作之結論謂、日本所處之現况、實已陷於最惡劣之境地、故無論英國或法國、決不願在此時予日本以友誼之合作、至美國在今决之努力中、則無疑係居於主動之地位也、</p>
<h3>各省市縣熱烈推行　建國儲蓄　郵局完威　發劵手續</h3>
<p>國民政府爲獎勵國民節的儲蓄、自辦建國事業起見、指定各銀行舉辦建國儲金、郵政儲余匯業局發行節約建國儲蓄券、全國各省市縣、業已一致推行、中央以事關建國大計、自成立全國節的建國儲蓄運動委員會、統籌主持推動、現川黔湘桂各省重要城市、已决第成立分會、全國一千餘局、亦已於上月底以前先後完成發行建國儲蓄券手續、各地黨政機關一致協同宣傳、國民激於愛國熱忱、參加節的儲蓄、輔助國家建國事業、至爲熱烈踴躍、</p>
<h3>米價可望　脫離日方覊軛　貢米昨又到埠每包價約卅元　外報對米價騰貴之一面觀察</h3>
<p>滬市米况將趨穩定、國米貢米蜂湧抵埠、日昨由香港運到貢米二萬餘包、已於昨日上午進棧候顧、共成本較輕、每包一百八十九斤、僅及國幣三十元左右、聞本市各米業行號甫在接洽作第三次訂購、運滬儲藏、務使市儈作祟技窮力盡、並可脫離日方覊軛、米行茶會市塲迭經該市塲管理委員會嚴厲監視同業買賣、及執行塲規維持秩序後、粳秈米價已於前日起開始回跌、滬市五百萬市民、對於放近米市趨勢、頗爲注意、除深盼當局嚴密澈査造謠米蠹、及嚴厲執行限價外、並望米市塲主管人加緊設法安定人心、俾市價節節下降、</p>
<p>外報論調歸咎日方</p>
<p>英文大美晚報見高漲、華字報紙今乃嚴責本埠市塲上之操縱者、但據更密切之調查所悉、似不可歸罪於操縱者、蓋此種事態、乃日人所促成也、某晨報載、「官方未加干涉」一語、表示工部局對此局面、諒無行動、然據探悉、工部局所能爲者甚微、華字報紙傳華人商業團體採取之方法、如「請米市買方與賣方及掮客顧慮貧民生活、並警吿若輩不得自私自利而擾亂和平與秩序、」等、對於米市、並無影響、上海米價騰貴、絕非由於華商囤積所致、實可完全歸咎於日本、此乃記者調査米况所得結論、</p>
<p>匯率雖低貢米仍廉</p>
<p>記者聞某君稱、目下之局面、難堪已極、雖滙率低落、但西貢米仍較國米稍廉、夫復何言云、長江流域本年產米雖不若正常的政治情况中所產爲多、但仍稱豐收、而九月份新米登塲後、足有六個至八個月之米糧、供給上海、至明年四五六月間始罄、但此等米糧、並未運來滬市、其故有數端、綜而言之、皆因日軍在華故也、</p>
<p>日本產米缺少原因</p>
<p>本年日本產米時低落什四、原因在（一）天時失常、（二）應從事耕耘之農民、多入行伍、（三）農婦今入軍火廠工作、往時日本歉收、恒較常時低落什二、本年且倍之、常時日本歉收、即仰給於朝鮮、但本年朝鮮亦吿歉收、而不能期望朝鮮之援助、結果、日本唯有一事可為、即印刷大量花紙、稱之曰「日元」「華興票」或其他任何名稱、由日軍携往　湖與太湖間之廣大產米區、藉以解決日本之米荒、持槍刺執紙「幣」之日兵、施行此奸計、需要米糧者、非僅日本本國而已、在中國戰塲上之百萬日兵、亦需要之、且日軍之隨從者、亦取給於此、故日軍所食、不僅百萬人之米糧而已、</p>
<p>勒索捐稅運輸困難</p>
<p>所剩餘之米經種種困難與日偽之捐「稅」、始運抵工海與他處、目下內地米價每石十八至二十元、經沿道榨取、抵滬時乃漲至三十五元、遝輸時重量之减少、加以販賣者圖取薄利、米價乃達四十元左右、自西貢輸入之米、雖匯率低落、並加運費、亦較四十元之數略低、華人平均每日每人食米二磅、一家三口者、每日共麥六磅、則每月耗於米者的四十元、但一般華人收入、月僅三十五元左右、</p>
<h3>綸昌老廠新糾紛　趨勢消弭　工人不願冉供利用　日內即可全部復工</h3>
<p>浦東陸家嘴英商綸昌紡織廠新廠工潮解决後、工人陸續復工、已無問題、惟白蓮涇綸昌老廠工人、因指此次解决條件、不若當初勞資直接談判時之優厚、故發生新波折、並將住居浦西之工人攔阻上工、茲據調査、一般工人因停工日久、生活維艱、誓不願再供他人無謂之利用、故開工之日、被阻止上工者、現有一部份繼續進廠、雖未佔絕大多數、但衆信不數日間、即可如數復工、故新糾紛將消弭於無形、</p>
<h3>內地來滬之蛋　日仍統制</h3>
<p>三十日法文上海日報載、按自若干時來、日商三井會社、會將各外商所購之蛋運滬時、輒加以扣留、因此曾引起各方面之抗議、事後、此蛋亦曾歸還原主、現據日方當局表示、在原則上、蛋市已恢復目由、但應有若干「手續」耳、但所謂「手續」者、幾將外商運出蛋市以外耳、在實際上、則外商在內地購蛋之先、須向日商會繳費每籃二日元、一以領得執照、實則此商會、確屬三井會社之化名耳、而在領執照時、外商須將其蛋百分之五十、以售與三井會社、而其售價、則由三井自定之、但此項代價、則每較內地蛋價爲低、</p>
<h3>銀錢業準備　年度總結賬　十二月三十日照常辦公　錢業農歷年底亦辦結賬</h3>
<p>民國二十八年度結賬期轉瞬將屆、銀錢業公會會員行莊業巳開始準備、惟十二月三十一日總結賬期、適爲星期日例假、今銀錢兩業已內定是日照常辦公、決俟兩業公會通過後即公吿實行、並定明年元旦起休假三天、四日起開市營業、至於錢業之總結賬向爲農曆之年終、（即二月七日）惟今年除於農曆年終辦理總結賬外、並於國曆年終亦辦理年度結賬、關於十二月二日之會員常會、昨已決定暫停舉行、十一月份拆息、待二日之常務委員會議決定之、又新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、上海之金融市塲、因中中交農四行之貼放、及銀錢業準備會庫之調劑、雖國曆年終結賬期將屆、而市塲依然穩定如恒、銀根毫無緊張之現象、所以各業之安渡國曆年終、決無問題矣、</p>
<h3>江海關職工　發給津貼</h3>

<h3>糧食　魔手把持滬米市　上午米價本已回小　銀行業囤積又回高</h3>
<p>邇來米市、時上時落、雖似倐忽不定、然究竟恒祗一二元之上落、一高即低、循環相轉、可稱爲盤旋之局、昨市初則以隔昨餘波、其勢仍軟、旣而削低之後、又復回緊、所以收盤行情、無甚上落、乃晨間一般作客、處此市面恒多變化、不易捉摸、當旣日見市色轉軟、抱穩健主義、遂均不敢貿然進取、客販心理、一則以前者趁高扳持、手中剩貨頗夥、再則已知傳言不確、續到絡繹不絕、蘇嘉路一帶之貨抵埠者三十餘車、且大宗洋米、一朝運申、恒以萬計、在途决者亦絡續將到、深恐被其牽制、殆將不可挽回之虞、爲此種種情山、絕謀早售、况市面已疲、鮮有問津、而北洋帮手中之巨數洋米、獨樹一幟、頻以廉價拋售、若西貢米低至三十三元、心尤急急、遂均步步落低、一律鬆脫、所以銷塲愈呆、迄中市各貨悉已跌去一元有奇、至於一般囤戶及投機家本欲伺機再砌爐灶、茲見各價一路貶低、認爲時機又臨、大可趁廉搜進、突出魔手、大事操縱、霎時形勢之緊、復趨轟動、而本鄉店胃觀望已久、際此遂亦出手跟進、銷塲活潑、市價回升、若西貢跟踪迫近已抵三十四元、一時將早間所落之價一律恢復、所以收盤與前市無所榮辱、而稱定局、</p>
<p>客秈晨市頗形軟弱、因京蕪江北各路旣源源到下、而洋米復有湧到、且江北方面尙有整批待裝、故開價即被浮戶求晚所抑低、比之前日小去半元許、然價小後即有店囤吸收、允以銀行業大戶爲貪、以致後市又見回漲近元、結果反比前市較大三五角云、</p>
<p>洋米連日由香港運到七萬四五千包、西貢定貨最早之一批、即可在日上抵滬、據說總計約有四萬包、市上已有三十九元〇五分之路貨售開、故晨間頗疲軟、價小五六角不等、後市則被大戶行囤及收、價又反振近元、高洋米又至卅五元、碎米日前小至廿七八元者、因價低動銷、昨乃昂至廿九元半及什九元二三角、</p>
<h3>麵粉克盤愈緊　小麥又創高價</h3>
<p>現粉市况、續形緊俏、査客路銷塲、南北兩帮、均有指辦、惟額數並不暢旺、蓋目下各廠以原料價貴、成本高昂、尙不肯儘量供售、本街零批交易、亦以月底關係、實銷並不十分暢旺、皆被囤戶收買之故、市面依然緊俏、聞二號粉廠盤本街仍爲七元六角、而客盤均須七元七角、回籠貨棧單更須提高五六分至一角不等、全市成交總額的計四萬包左右、內地雜牌粉成交亦有二三千包均係本街去路、價爲七元至七元零五分云、</p>
<p>小麥市况、更見俏俐、蓋目下滬市一再飛漲、內地產價隨之步騰、致來源日益减少、執貨莫不居奇、更被行囤關住、不願輕晚、故廠胃雖佳、而售者甚尠、結果昨日廠家成交祗開二三千包、價尙站十二元、而棧交貨則已漲越十二元大關、又創新高價、聞市塲成交四五車、最高價已達十二元二角云、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油搗把　非達百元不休</h3>
<p>豆油市塲中之搗把分子、對於大連鐵桶油之行市、非達一百元買一担（司碼秤）不休、致昨開之價又漲三元半（二十八日爲九十三元半）、爲九十七元、仍由多頭公司放出十桶、其他紛紛跟進元許、共成交靑島湘二十桶、價爲九十五元、又路貨價爲九十四元、本廠油一百祖、價爲七卞六元半、烟岐油一百五十件、價爲七十一元半、靑岐油路貨二百件、價爲七十元零五角、膠州油五十件、價爲六十九元半、花生油因乏操縱之流、全靠實銷動辦、故潛勢轉定、昨膠州油仍開七十一元、成交一百件、由本街等問津、香港帮採去江北聽裝油一千聽、價爲九十三元云、</p>
<p>昨日烟臺來豆油三百四十件、天津來豆子五千包桐油三十件、今日出口至香港豆子四百二十包、生油二百九十五聽、</p>
<h3>紗花　美棉現貨　出一角關　本花腳地有力</h3>
<p>本棉交易不弱、比上日較少、市價平平、與上日不相上下、實係連朝同行買賣發達、本日稍見平靜、惟靑島方面採辦美棉通花兩項、額子較夥、故市情依然緊張、此因海外歐美棉市一致在騰、印棉漲度異常劇烈、美棉現貨已衝出一角關外、此種情形、允使多方興奮、所以棉市脚地較紗市爲昂、且紗廠又復巨量開出棉紗、將來對於原料非補償不可也、蘇北來源、計通花一千九百九十八包、常陰沙一千四百三十五包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐的棉市晨初即呈堅定、利物浦及孟買來電俱吿上漲、海外棉商對於美棉一致看漲、故紛紛前來購買、因之棉價異常挺秀、續後又因現貨商交易活躍、結果收盤價格較之上日漲起十餘磅音、印度棉市昨日連同預測猛漲十四羅比、埃及漲六十餘磅音、利物沛漲十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊爲靜寂、惟各方心意對於原棉却一致看高、奈因目前價格太高、無從下手之苦、昨日申新廠開出二十支雙馬七八千件、預料日內美棉將形活躍也、茲將昨日美棉以美匯七元八一二五、折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>紗市為棉帶起　申新開出期紗九千餘包</h3>
<p>上日疲憊不振之紗市、昨得海外印美棉市一致飛騰之推助、市况又復上升、但實際交易、依然沉寂、此因各方交通障碍、運輸不能敏捷、因之生意不能發展、惟一般投機者、鑒於外棉如斯在跳、心中躍躍欲試、在市搜羅者亦頗不乏人、惜乎實銷不起、未免美中不足、不過棉市堅挺、廠方成本增高、聞申新九廠有巨量開出、二十支雙馬九千一百五十包、價爲六百七十五元、期限爲明年一·二月份、每包收定洋六十元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開同業相聚談論、心思大都看好、因爲美棉既漲、印棉猛跳尤甚、所以目標視重大漲風、開價漲十四元、二十支雙馬價爲六百七十八元但均係同行成交十包、加之客帮無動靜、市况曾一度擯持、而徐徐回下、跌至六百七十元、迨至收盤又復回上三四元、查半日間成交統計一千二百七十七包、行情二十支雙馬漲八元、天女漲九元、雙地球漲七元、今日有棉紗三十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋成交何旺</h3>
<p>布市仍乏大宗現銷、乃以布價低於成本、廠盤高不可攀、紗花又吿猛漲、故布盤允形穩固、散戶手貨粗布按市廉一二角仍有賣出、惟數額無多、色布·色斜·漂布每疋漲二三角、細紗貨以原料飛漲、春令府綢等貨客戶心思轉濃、慶豐條素府綢開出定貨五百餘箱、本街成交大鵬·富貴·細布·各廠粗布·細斜二百餘包、漂布·色布·絨布一萬餘疋、粵帮辦同豐花絨二千餘疋、細布粗布百餘包、蘇皖口岸、蚌埠蕪湖各埠添辦頗旺、惟浙東各埠情形淸淡、疋頭廿九件今日運香港、</p>
<p>東疋·細布細斜市盤、昨以本街同業及業外囤戶、繼續搜辦、漲勢仍旺、十二磅龍頭細布上午市塲喊價盤旋於十九元一角半至二角間、下午因東棉伊藤等行開出下月份龍頭期貨每疋價爲二十元、人心益昂、現貨售盤一度漲至十九元五角半、嗣以獲利吐出、降至十九元三角、收盤重趨上騰、爲十九元四角半、全日現貨成交在一千件以上、行方訂開下月期貨亦達千件左右、開價如下、</p>

<h3>如何糾正兒童的不良習慣</h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>前幾天本刊先後討論到孩子的敎育和處罰諸問題，筆者在一本外國雜誌上看到關於糾正兒童不良習慣的實騐敎育，特將其例子舉幾個，作爲小學敎員和家長們的參考。</p>
<p>一個發怒着的孩子，拾起一個花瓶想擊玻璃窗，普通家畏或敎員一定要叱他出去了，但是實騐學校的敎師並不，反說：「你丢吧！如果你準備賠償的話」。這孩子無禮地說：「你要我怎樣賠？」敎師說「幾個下午不許游泳，你該知道這塊玻璃値幾張游泳券的」</p>
<p>孩子不響了，從此他就得到了「責任」的觀念。即使他打破了玻璃，責打是無用的，責打同這破壞的損失不生關係。</p>
<p>一個孩子常犯偷小錢，被家長送進實騐學校，經調査結果，這孩子所偷的錢，都是用來購買友情的，送給小朋友的，這是因爲他的父母待他十分冷淡，一點也不給他所需要的情感，致生此惡果，實騐學校給他了所需要的，他便是一個好孩子了。</p>
<p>一天校中一個女孩子，在外邊玩了一天，第二天回校，先生並不駡她，只說：「你使我們很不開心，我們多麼歡喜你，一天不見使我們怪惦念的，來吧，把你的頭髮梳一梳，這是我們唯一的要求！」她愉快地服從。這件好事是她以爲光榮而不忘的，而使她偶然做的「壞事」，也是她以爲恥辱而不忘的。</p>
<p>由此三事看來，糾正兒童不良習慣，我們應從不良習慣的來源上着手，方能有效，徒加呵斥打駡，孩子並不知道他的過失，但因潛在的原因的小滅，他往往仍舊不知不覺的犯過，那末試間責駡有何用處呢？</p>
<p>還有一點，孩子是歡喜被讚美的，我們常見父母曲意的溺愛子女，却難得見他們讚美和妓勵子女的。孩干做了一件好事，讚美使他下决再做；孩子將做一件好事，讚美使他速成它，這種心理其實大人也未嘗沒有，不過因爲大人「世故」深了，讚美效力較小而已。純潔的童心是需要一些讀美的。</p>
<p>父母爲了子女的不良習慣而煩惱時，敎師爲了小學生頑皮而發怒時，如果處罰他們，得考慮處罰的效果如何，把孩子當作出氣洞是不應該的，應該尋求根本解決的辦法，如上所述，我以爲。</p>
<h3>關於學校膳費問題的建議</h3>
<p>— 張福鏞</p>
<p>在春秋上讀到某家長的「加膳費一一文，除了對那些做米生意的諸公表示十分的「欽佩」外？我還覺得有「二點意見可以向賢明的學校當局建議：</p>
<p>本來膳費的繳納，普通學校是規定一决付淸的，這是體諒廚房方面能够預算正確的緣故，倒也是層正正當當的充分理由，母庸異議。然而在目前孤島各物飛漲，跌落不定的時候。假若還一本固有的規則，膳費一次繳納，一有餘發還，不足補充」的條例下來實行，我絕對的不敢贊同，因爲這裏面的弊害很多，最顯明的，就是像某家長親身經歷的「先生做米生意」和「學校借一個小風浪呑下一筆鉅款」了。</p>
<p>當然，那些「做米生意」的先生不是「好敎師」，「呑下一筆鉅款」的學校也不是「好機關」，但孤島上還有不少抱定「百年樹人」，忍行實幹地來訓練靑年的優良學校，這許多磨琢柱石的塲所，我極願他們敎師，學生，家長之間互相保持着熱烈的情感，不要爲了膳費的問題而各趨極端。</p>
<p>但這並不是簡單的讓步問題，而需要根本地來改善繳納勝費，正因爲孤島的生活程度是依市價的漲落而定的。所以我認爲關於膳食方面的費用繳納，必須實行「月繳」——視一月問之各物市價，定一月之膳費多寡，市價漲了，沒有客氣的，可以增加適當的比例，這時候做家長的人我想不會不了解學校當局和廚房方面的苦衷的；同樣地，在市價回跌的當兒，也應該儘量將這一月的膳食費用抑低，不要認定「金錢第一」的卑劣目標，而來喪失良心地「乘火打刦」一决，完全忘懷了自己是個神聖的「敎育人員」。</p>
<p>關於這種膳費月繳的好處，我可以舉出幾點來寫在下面</p>
<p>（一）依市價的漲落而決定一月的膳費多寡，不僅可以避免雙方無謂的誤會，並且能够使一個經濟　据的家長，從容地實行所謂「分期付款」，免得在開學期內爲了幾　子女的膳費急得「走頭無路。</p>
<p>（二）沒有了像某家長所痛詆的「漲價時不加，跌價時反加百分之六十」的弊病。</p>
<p>（三）最低限度學校方面對於膳食可以做得順利，家長方面對於付費也表示滿意，避免了膳費問題的爭執。</p>
<p>這辦法已經由幾個個學校實行了，我以爲不曾發動這種辦法而還在感覺得困難的各學校，不妨試一下子，定能得到完滿的結果。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十八回　談經濟繁榮興舊市　述婚姻掠奪遺風</p>
<p>何儷玉問道：後來怎樣上海又繁榮起來了呢？」邵慧華道：『那時我在國外留學，不能知道一切的詳盡。但只知道中國戰後復興，上海又漸漸的繁榮起來了。第一個原因：是中國　農業國漸漸變成工業國，這倒是我在外國，一位研究中國的經濟學家講給我聽的。他說：在中日戰爭的時候，內地的富豪，全都逃避到上海。因此上海的游資很多，許多銀行裏的存款，任憑你限制提現，反而比戰前爲多。但是一個人有了錢，終想把它運用，不能死存枉銀行裏。還有一種人，他根本就不相信銀行，他就吃過銀行幾决虧，於是有整千整萬的鈔票藏在家中鐵箱裏的。也有的，喜歡做投機事業的，什麽賣空買空的事都做，公債咧，金子咧，紗布咧，麵粉咧，自己本不是內行，稍爲得着一點小利，沾沾自喜，及至放手去做，弄成一個大胞空。還有的，趁此機會，做那損人肥已的事，如囤米，堆煤，收賣銅鐵等等。到了歐戰一起，他們想：第一次歐戰，發財的人很多，於是市塲上的顏料，西藥，報紙，呢絨等等，都被囤積起來。其實市面上要支配起來，並不缺貨，而且在航路未斷的時候，也還有得運來。可是經此一壟斷，貨物缺乏，市面也混亂了。這是我說的還是善能運用其游資的，有些不善運用者，便把他們的游資，送到了一切的賭塲。所以在中日戰爭的時候，正是上海的各賭塲披猖的時候，而沒有一個賭塲，不是滿坑滿谷，窮奢極欲，所見的全是鈔票籌碼而已。爲什麽如此呢？就是游資充塞在上海的緣故呀！其他如娛樂之所，跳舞之塲，少年男女，演成慘劇，也不必去說它了。但是一到戰後，萬不能再如此，游資更不能讓它游來游去。上海旣換了一個局面，不正當的營業，便嚴行取締。交易所不許做期貨，賣空買空當然是絕跡了。根本說一句話，所有人民的資本，都用在正常的用途。怎樣纔是正當的用途呢？便是戰後的開發實業了。便是發財，也要費心勞力，有助於社會，纔是道理。若是做那些投機事業，這與賭博又何以異。　（二〇九）</p>
<h3>不合理的兒童懲罰法</h3>
<p>— 羽佳</p>
<p>我的妹妹在大沽路某女中附小讀書，昨天回家吿訴我說：她學校裏一年級的一個同學因偷了別人的鉛筆橡皮，被敎師在胸前貼上了一張「我偷東西」的紙條，强迫着站在公衆的地方，使同學們都能看見她，又慫恿大家把她羞辱，那不過還是九歲的小女孩，羞得面也靑了。我聽了，不禁打了一個寒噤，啊！這就是所謂新式的兒童敎育，這就是遵行敎部禁止體罰的規例。</p>
<p>中國兒童的命運彷彿生來就是可悲的；剛從舊式弒塾的酷刑之下逃脫出來，又要忍受這新式的精神鞭撻。想想吧，還不過是九歲呢，無論犯的是如何重大的罪名，如此殘酷的責罰總不該臨到她的身上吧；何况罪名還不過是缺乏自制心，取了自己愛好而不是自己的東西呢。論理一個九歲的女孩我們實在不能向她苛求過甚，當然我們對她所作的過失決不能漠視姑息，但循循善誘，施之以精神的感化，使她覺悟到自己的錯處不也就够了嗎？把一個幼小脆弱的心靈　得粉碎的舉動無論如何我們不能說較加以肉體的鞭扑爲文明吧？也許這位敎師還以爲殺鷄給猴子看其他學生當可凜然而自慶得計。這是錯了？只要我們想像一下這新式的懲戒所能加於兒童一生的影響，我們就不能不悚然了。人類都有自尊心，兒童便能例外嗎？肉體上的痛楚日子久了，還可以忘記；自尊心的摧毀，聰明的敎師將如何把他補綴呢？別以爲祗是一張紙條，別以爲只貼一天，幼稚的心靈上的烙印是永不能磨滅的，它的可悲的後果我們是可以預測的；同學們以後對她的鄙夷，恥笑，冷漠與不信任我們是可以推想的；她以後所受的歧視與心靈的痛苦我們是可以斷言的。不要以爲兒童的心是單純，惟其單純的心所以易於摧挫，保護她且不及，而橫加以打擊，橫加以打擊者又是父母所信託，一個人一生的前程之所寄與的小學敎師，我們能說這是可恕的嗎？說什麼懲罰，這張紙條不是强迫兒童繼續她的過失而關閉她的自新之鬥的封條嗎？</p>
<p>賢明的敎師們！我十二分的熱誠希望你們認淸楚自己的責任，你們一舉一動將維躱着無數兒童一生的前途，你們偶然的不經意的言談舉止，將加兒童以你們自己所不能測的影響，也不願再說什麼敎育神聖，但敎育者之重負，尤其是在這時代之急流中，都該鄭重注意吧。</p>

<h3>勞勃泰勒　暢談銀幕生活</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>勞勃泰勒告訴我們說：當他剛從柏麻那學院（Pamona　College）畢業出來的時候，當然啦，他得謀一個位置做事。他說：「當時的遭遇，眞幸運極了。我有機會進了影片公司常演員之後，公司當局與一般觀衆都很看得起我，他們的那種熱烈的獎勵與讚譽，至今還不曾忘却呢！」</p>
<p>勞勃泰勒在今日的好萊塢影壇上，眞可以算得是一個大名鼎　的紅星了，他又繼續着告訴了我們：「的確，從事銀幕生活，實不如一般外界的人士所想像的那麽寫意。然而，比起他種繁重的事務來，水銀燈下的生活，也還算不得頂頂的苦。我每天在六時起身，九時後，就往攝影塲中去工作，回家的時問，總要在八時以後。每天差不多要工作十二小時左右。從事影業與從事其他各部門的職務，可以說一無不同的地方，當演員，擢升的機會也很多，只要一個人工作認眞，服務的成績優良，他是凖會在電影界中得到驚人的成功的</p>
<p>「在個人方面講起來，」他又說道：「電影演員也可以度着任何種他所喜歡的生活。在星期六晚上，他也可以像其他的人們一樣，走到各娛樂塲所中去恢復他一週來的疲勞的精神。</p>
<p>當一個紅影星走進了某個公共塲所的時候，當然的，會引起無數「影迷們」的瘋在。對這一　瘋在與紛擾，泰勒倒並不埋怨。</p>
<p>總而言之，泰勒對於他自已所度的銀幕生活是很滿足的。他說：「任何怨恨吃影戲飯的人們，應該再來賽成一種業餘的嗜好（像玩梵啞林，就是一個極好的例子），以調劑從影生活的單調的。」</p>
<h3>護目銀幕　可使影迷目力不傷</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>電影損傷目力一，這是一般影迷所最關心而時常提出討論的問題，主要的原因，是爲銀幕光綫的不適宜。一個銀幕和放映燈柑比，如果嫌太大，不合分寸，或是反射出來的光太低，以及所射出的光不十分强而不能使影院中每一角落裏所坐的人看得淸楚，這些都足損傷目力的。放映燈所射出的光錢太弱可又是另一種普通的弊病。</p>
<p>所以要補救這些缺點，關鍵就在選擇適於影院中每一座位的銀幕和放映燈。就專家硏究的結果，這倒是一個有關於工程方面的問題。最近爲了使銀幕損傷影迷的目力，减至最低限度起見，便有人新發明一種Syorex式銀幕。在電影院裏，這的確是一種新的發明，不久將開幕的大華大戲院，已購得此種新式銀幕，且已裝置完成了。</p>
<p>這種新式銀幕，特殊的優點，就在反射出來的光綫，使電影院中每一座位，看去是一樣的强烈。同時，這種銀慕，又是含有彩色感光作用，外面蒙有一種新的媒介物，可以吸住彩色。結果不拘是放映彩色時或黑白片顯出時，在銀幕上光綫都很明晰，使觀衆覺得分外的滿意。</p>

<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「萬里尋師一是紀述一八七〇年紐的先驅報記者施丹萊長途跋涉菲洲森林，訪尋英人李溫士頓醫生的故事。今年是施丹萊的逝世三十五週紀念，二十世紀福斯因特地攝製道部「萬里尋師來紀念他。施丹萊的不辭辛苦，勇於任事的精神，自然是値得後人紀念的，不過由於英美兩國的歧視有色人種的偏狹之見，我們曾看到過各種腔調有色人種的殘酷屠殺的行爲，而反襯白種人「文明」的野歡片和戰爭片，「戰地英魂，」和「貢格廷」最顯著的例子；「萬里尋師」自然也在這樣的角度下來攝製的，雖然它的主題已從「侵略」而讓步到「感化，」如李溫士頓醫生在菲洲的領導土人唱聖詩，和土人的感謝他的醫治疾病，但是最後施丹萊的露赴菲洲，以竟李溫士頓醫生之遺志，還是他們一貫的政策，——有色人種是卑賤的民族，而是應該由他們來歸化的。</p>
<p>導演金亨利氏在這里似乎不能盡展所長，第一是這故事的平舖直叙，沒有發展的機會；其决，在施丹萊深入菲洲腹地的時候，盡面組織不够簡潔，這樣旣沒有顯出施丹萊的千辛萬苦，尋獲李溫士頓醫生也是脆弱無力。</p>
<p>由此更影響了史本塞屈賽的演技，他的施丹萊，除了在皇家地理學會聚會中有幾個突出的鏡頭外，其餘都是平平過去。南姗凱蘭和李却葛林也沒有什麽成就。</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Announces Severance of Relations with Finland; Massive Air, Land, and Sea Attacks Yesterday; Army Crosses Border and Occupies Ribachi Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean; Helsinki Attacked by Air, Two Soviet Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>London (From Helsinki) After Soviet troops invaded Finnish territory this morning, heavy fighting has occurred in several locations. Shortly after Moscow announced to the world the severing of diplomatic relations with Finland, the powerful Soviet war machine, including infantry, aircraft, and heavy artillery, began operations. The initial point of Soviet incursion into Finland was in several locations in the Karelian Isthmus. Subsequently, Soviet aircraft appeared over Helsinki. As of this evening, the Soviet side has (1) bombarded the Vammelsuu area of the Karelian Isthmus from the sea (primarily from Kronstadt), (2) exchanged artillery fire with Finland in the Kiviniemi area, (3) occupied a small corner of Suojärvi, (4) dropped incendiary bombs on the Malmi airfield near Helsinki and the eastern part of Vyborg, causing several fires, (5) attacked Helsinki by air, causing minor damage, (6) occupied the Finnish part of the northernmost Ribachi Peninsula on the Soviet-Finnish border, and (7) bombarded the Triigioki area near the Soviet border. According to the Finnish Ministry of Defence, as of now, two Soviet aircraft have been shot down, one near Helsinki. It is also reported that Soviet forces are preparing to land on the island of Seiskari in the Gulf of Finland. This morning, Soviet aircraft flew over Helsinki three times, the first at 9:15, the second shortly after by a giant bomber flying very low, and the third at 11:00 by four Soviet aircraft flying over the harbor. Coastal defense batteries opened fire, but missed. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki Soviet troops crossed the northern border of Finland this morning, occupying the Ribachi Peninsula along the Arctic Ocean (Note: This peninsula is where fishermen reside). (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, received the Finnish envoy to the Soviet Union, Koskinen, at 10:30 PM (local time) this evening and presented a note stating that the Soviet government has decided to sever diplomatic relations with Finland. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki Three Soviet aircraft appeared over the city at 9:50 this morning, separately scouting various districts. Anti-aircraft artillery and machine guns immediately opened fire, but missed. Nine Soviet aircraft were also detected at the Suomenlinna naval port at 10:45 this morning, but no bombs were dropped. Finnish air defense forces also engaged them. The Finnish Broadcasting Corporation had not yet reported the Soviet invasion of the country by noon. According to reports from the village of Vammelsuu, Soviet artillery has been bombarding the Karelian Isthmus. There was also artillery fire in the village of Kiviniemi. It is reported that the Red Army has occupied Finnish territory between Hiihtola and the Soviet border. According to Finnish News Agency, Soviet aircraft bombed the eastern district of the port of Vyborg at around 9:00 this morning. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow Finnish envoy to the Soviet Union, Koskinen, and embassy staff have prepared to leave the Soviet Union, but it is unlikely to happen today. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin This afternoon, it was no longer possible to call Helsinki from here. Telephone lines between Stockholm and Helsinki have also been cut off, apparently severing foreign telephone communications. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow As of 3:30 PM, the Soviet official stance on the Finnish situation remains one of strict silence. It is claimed that Moscow has not received any information regarding the rumors of Soviet air force incursions into Finland. Diplomatic sources here state that the Red Army General Staff has notified military attachés of various countries, asserting that the Finnish News Agency's reports of Soviet aircraft attacks on Finland and battles along the Finnish border are inaccurate. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki There were as many as thirteen Soviet aircraft that dropped bombs in the suburbs of this city this morning. The report that two of them were shot down has been officially confirmed. At the same time, news has been received that Soviet ground forces have crossed the border and invaded Finnish territory. The local radio station has issued a warning to residents not to linger in the streets during air raids. Elementary school teachers have been instructed to prevent students from leaving classrooms after hearing an air raid alert. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>London This place has received unconfirmed news from Helsinki stating that Soviet troops crossed into Finnish territory at 9:15 AM (local time) this morning, invading several locations in the Karelian Isthmus. Ten minutes later, an air raid siren sounded in Helsinki, and soon Soviet aircraft appeared in the sky, but did not drop any bombs. Anti-aircraft batteries fired heavily at them. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki According to reports from here today, the war between the Soviet Union and Finland has broken out due to Soviet aircraft attacking Helsinki and the Soviet Red Army crossing the border at three locations. At the same time, part of Finnish Suojärvi has been occupied by the Soviet Red Army. This morning, a Soviet aircraft circled over Helsinki and dropped five bombs on the airfield, causing no damage. Later, six Soviet bombers appeared and then flew away towards Finland. The Soviet Red Army's offensive towards the Finnish border is divided into three points: (1) The Karelian sector north of Lake Ladoga in southwestern Finland, where the Soviet Red Army continues to bombard heavily. The Soviet Navy has also been bombarding the Karelian Peninsula. (2) The Suojärvi area north of Lake Ladoga, part of which has fallen due to the Soviet Red Army's offensive. Telephone communication between Helsinki and Suojärvi was cut off during the Red Army's offensive. (3) The northernmost point of Finland, the areas of Lappi and the Kola Peninsula. When the air raid alert sounded in Helsinki, people took refuge in bomb shelters, and traffic was temporarily suspended. Soon, air raid wardens wearing helmets, protective clothing, and gas masks appeared on the streets, and traffic soon returned to normal. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki The Helsinki radio station briefly reported at 1:15 PM that the Red Army had invaded Finnish territory and read a short announcement about the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. Finally, it mentioned that Soviet aircraft had appeared in the Finnish sky. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen This morning, the Danish newspaper "B.T." issued a special edition declaring, "War has broken out!" At 9:10 AM (Finnish time) this morning, a large Soviet army entered the Finnish border, Soviet aircraft hovered over Helsinki, and the Soviet Navy also mobilized. At 10:00 AM, Finnish anti-aircraft guns bombarded Soviet bombers, and air raid sirens sounded throughout Helsinki. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen The Finnish News Agency reports that Soviet aircraft dropped five small bombs on the Malmi airfield near Helsinki. The airfield did not suffer any damage. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>Helsinki After the Soviet government issued a note yesterday declaring the termination of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, the Finnish response was delivered to Moscow this afternoon. The Finnish envoy to the Soviet Union, Koskinen, originally intended to deliver it to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the evening, but was unable to do so because the Soviet Union had severed diplomatic relations with Finland. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Secretary of State Hull States: The United States is Willing to Mediate, Only Hoping for a Peaceful Resolution to the Soviet-Finnish Dispute, Clarifying that it Has No Intention of Arbitrating</h3>
<p>Washington According to reports from Stockholm, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, suddenly cancelled his scheduled hunting trip and flew from Stockholm to Riga, and will travel by train from Riga directly to Moscow. This has attracted great attention, and it is widely believed that the U.S. Ambassador will attempt to mediate the Soviet-Finnish dispute, but most observers say that the Soviet government will reject U.S. mediation. (United Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington Secretary of State Hull issued a statement to the newspapers, declaring that the United States is willing to mediate the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union. This was decided by Hull on a long-distance telephone call, following the advice of President Roosevelt. According to diplomatic sources, the United States regards this as an unavoidable duty and a matter of utmost urgency, and therefore issued it in the form of a statement, hoping to arouse world public opinion and eliminate the Soviet-Finnish war before it occurs. Previously, when relations between Germany and Poland were tense, President Roosevelt appealed to the heads of state of those countries in a personal capacity. Because the President is currently resting in Hot Springs, Secretary of State Hull made this move. Since 1938, whenever a crisis has occurred in Europe, the U.S. government has asked the authorities of the countries involved to choose one of three methods: reconciliation, mediation, or arbitration. However, this mediation is considered the beginning. However, Secretary of State Hull made some reservations in his statement, namely:</p>
<p>Declaring that the U.S. government only hopes that the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union can be resolved peacefully, and is not acting as an arbitrator. As to why he used a statement instead of directly making a proposal to the countries involved, it was to avoid attacks from isolationists. At the same time, because U.S. public opinion is extremely indignant towards the Soviet Union, it should be taken into account. If one of the two countries, Finland or the Soviet Union, refuses U.S. mediation, then who is the aggressor is self-evident. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>London The British Foreign Office issued a communiqué stating that the British government welcomes the news that the U.S. government intends to mediate the Soviet-Finnish dispute, and believes that this type of dispute does not warrant any party involved adopting a war plan. The British government sincerely hopes that this proposal will be accepted by both parties. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington President Roosevelt returned here from Hot Springs today and consulted with Secretary of State Hull on the Soviet-Finnish situation. At the same time, he learned that an official from the Soviet Embassy had advised the U.S. government that it might not be necessary for the U.S. to mediate the Soviet-Finnish dispute in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. On the Finnish side, the Finnish envoy to the United States has notified the U.S. government that Finland welcomes U.S. mediation. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Soviet invasion of Finland that the British government is deeply saddened by this newly occurring attack on a small, independent country, as the result of this action will cause innocent people to suffer misfortune and loss of life. The British government welcomes the willingness of U.S. Secretary of State Hull to mediate. The British government believes that the issue in dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland is not of a nature to resort to war. (London, 30th)</p>
<h3>Germany Has No Intention of Serving as a Mediator</h3>
<p>Berlin Political figures here are taking a calm attitude towards the tense situation between the Soviet Union and Finland. It is solemnly stated here that Germany does not intend to become involved in the Soviet-Finnish conflict, nor does it intend to serve as a mediator. The newspapers here only carry news from Moscow and Helsinki and do not offer any comments. Political figures believe that the Soviet government's desire is to escape the constraints of the post-World War I era and restore control over the Gulf of Finland and the eastern Baltic Sea. It is claimed that this is the Soviet Union's only demand and that it has no intention of ruling Finland. (Hapdong News Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>Finland Responds to Soviet Note, Suggesting Arbitration Methods</h3>
<p>Helsinki The Finnish government has responded to the note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov notifying them of the termination of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, denying that Finland has committed any border incursions. It stated that Finland only has border guard units stationed near the border, which are not a threat to Leningrad. There is no reason for the Soviet Union to terminate this pact. The pact should be valid until 1945. According to its provisions, difficulties between the two countries must be resolved peacefully through a conciliation committee. The Finnish government further suggested a method of arbitration by neutral countries. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Finnish President Declares War</h3>
<p>Oslo The public radio station here has issued a message stating that after the Soviet troops invaded Finland, Finnish President Kallio has declared a state of war and appointed General Mannerheim as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Principles of International Fairness and Arbitration</h3>
<p>Why is international unrest so severe today? China and Japan are at war, and England, France, and Germany are already at war. The killing can be described as cruel, and the impact can be described as tragic. The trend indicates that anyone can feel that crises are lurking and could erupt at any moment. The universality and depth of future disasters may far exceed the wars of these few countries. Following this evolution, who knows where it will end? Perhaps, in the end, no country, no race, no ordinary man or woman will be an exception, and the earth will become a huge furnace for a final reckoning. Perhaps it will be judged that the sins of mankind are too deep, and they will all perish together, or it will prove the greatness of the forces of justice and lay the foundation for civilization. If this is not the case, how will the killing ever stop, and how will the crisis ever be eliminated? If the crisis never ends and the killing never ceases, where is the blessed man, and where is the paradise? Is this not just feigning illness and alarming people with dangerous words? Hitler, a man with no place to stand, rose from the ranks and single-handedly destroyed the international order and European peace in less than twenty years. Is it said that other continents and countries will not produce scoundrels like Hitler? The Soviet Union, using the security of its city of Leningrad as an excuse, claimed that its small neighbor was a threat and an aggressor. It unilaterally terminated the treaty of non-aggression, refused to sever diplomatic relations, refused to accept replies, interfered in the other party's internal affairs, and demanded the reorganization of the government as a condition for peace. A country must have neighbors, and national strengths must vary. If we follow the Soviet Union's logic, what excuse is there for wanting to annex? If western neighbor Finland gives way, then will it accuse southern neighbor Romania of being a threat and an aggressor? If Finland perishes, then Sweden will become its western neighbor. If Sweden is unfortunate, then Norway will become its western neighbor. If we compromise, the crisis will never end. If we resist, the killing will never cease. Expansion is endless, and there will be no peace in the international community. If this is not a final reckoning, how can the situation be resolved?</p>
<p>Saying this does not mean that the war between China, Japan, England, and Germany is not enough and that the world urgently needs to engage in a large-scale war: but rather, that if mankind does not lose its rationality, it should not sit idly by and watch the natural development of everything, allowing the earth to become a huge furnace! Today, regardless of the size or strength of a country or race, regardless of whether its people are colored or not, we must inquire about their true wishes: do they care about perishing together, or will they work together to lay the foundation for civilization? Gather those who embrace civilization into one group, targeting those who admire civilization and accept the principles of international fairness. They must even be prepared to pay the necessary price for laying the foundation for civilization: to end wars, to end disputes, and to seek the principles of fairness to resolve difficulties. For example, the friction and conflict between England, France, and Germany have lasted for years, ultimately leading to today's state of war. In the days before the war, it has never been heard that either side sought the principles of fairness, or at least it has never been heard that either side denied any principles from the front. Those who interacted with each other only adhered to what they believed in: beliefs must distinguish between right and wrong, but each acted as its own master without seeking justice through arbitration: once the war began, the opportunity for arbitration disappeared. For example, the crisis between the Soviet Union and Finland is on the verge of breaking out: U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement indicated a willingness to mediate. As of last night, neither side had expressed anything, but according to reports from Finland, there are rumors that the Soviet Union has already rejected mediation. If mediation is indeed rejected, then there is no possibility of arbitration. However, I believe that those who admire civilization should not give up eating because of choking: the various countries and races outside the vortex should urgently catch up, establish principles of fairness, and pledge to uphold them. Even countries like China, Japan, England, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Finland, all who are willing to accept the principles of fairness and international arbitration, do not need to consider the other party's attitude and can take the lead in expressing this. Although it is impossible to implement arbitration until the other party agrees, it is enough to promote the establishment of principles of fairness and advocate the use of international arbitration. Moreover, there are many more hidden international crises than those that have already erupted: the Soviet Union and Finland are fighting in Northern Europe, but have you not heard of the storms in Central Europe? Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu praised the fairness of the Treaty of Craiova only the day before yesterday, declaring that the status quo should not be changed; while Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky immediately denounced it yesterday as unfair and in urgent need of revision, otherwise the peace and tranquility of the Carpathian Mountains cannot be guaranteed. Romania and Hungary may not immediately engage in armed conflict, but in the aftermath of the agitation, who can guarantee that a single spark will not start a prairie fire? Apart from premeditated aggression, wars must arise out of desperation: they begin with disputes, and when there is no avenue for dispute resolution, conflicts and wars break out. If today's Romania and Hungary are like this, the focus of the dispute lies in the fairness of the Treaty of Craiova: in reality, is what Romania calls fair truly fair? Is what Hungary calls unfair truly unfair? If there is no standard for this, what is the meaning of calling mankind rational animals? If disputes are decided by conflicts and wars, what is the meaning of human civilization? If the countries and races that admire civilization can cooperate to establish principles of fairness, and if Romania and Hungary can work together to lay the foundation for civilization, then at least one aspect of the Central European disputes can be expected to be eliminated. Three full months have passed since the outbreak of the European war. In these three months, new lessons have been revealed, exposing barbarism and threatening civilization. With these lessons before us, those among mankind who recognize that they have a responsibility to lay the foundation for civilization must not fail to be alarmed that civilization cannot be obtained without labor? If we are lucky enough to obtain it without labor, we will see the arrival of a final reckoning by iron and blood!</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Northeast Nanning; China and Japan Both Deploy Reinforcements to Arrange Defenses; The Most Intense Decisive Battle is About to be Realized</h3>
<p>Chongqing According to well-informed observers here, the most intense decisive battle of the Sino-Japanese War may soon be realized in the mountains of Guangxi Province. Since the Japanese army occupied Nanning, cutting off China's road traffic with Vietnam, both the Chinese and Japanese armies have rushed to deploy reinforcements and arrange defenses, preparing for a major battle. According to news from Beihai, a large number of Japanese troops have landed there and are heading to Nanning. According to military news from southern Guangxi, the Japanese army is currently continuing to advance in three routes to the west, north, and northeast. The main force is attacking Binyang along the main highway in southern Guangxi. It is reported that there is currently fierce fighting near Batang, northeast of Nanning. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing According to news from here today, the Japanese troops invading southern Guangxi are currently using Nanning as a base to advance on two routes north and south of Guangxi. There are currently 2,000 Japanese troops in Nanning. As for the Japanese troops on the Yongqin Highway, there are more than 10,000 troops. It is reported that the Japanese have repaired the road since the Chinese army retreated. The Japanese army's advance north from Nanning was launched on Sunday. Its immediate goal appears to be Binyang, fifty miles northeast of Nanning. Currently, the advancing Japanese army and the Chinese defending army are engaged in fierce fighting in this area. As for the Japanese army advancing west of Nanning, the target is still unknown. It is largely intended to cut off the new Southwest Highway, which will be completed in two periods.

<h3>Failure of the Japanese Army in Guangdong to Invade the North: Soldiers Drawn from All Fronts Launch an Attack in Three Routes, Resulting in a Complete Retreat Southwest of Yangmei</h3>
<p>Wengyuan: The Japanese army in Guangzhou has been invading the areas from Huaxian to Lubao on the Yuehan Railway for days, attempting to strengthen its outer defenses and support the Japanese army invading Guangxi. However, the Chinese side has discerned their plan and inflicted heavy damage on them at every turn. On the 18th and 19th, the Japanese army drew 10,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers from various fronts, gathering them in the area from Jiangcun, Gaotang, and Xinjie on the Yuehan Railway to Yahuhu, Banghu, and Longkou Village on the Guanghua Road. At the same time, more than 3,000 infantry soldiers were also concentrated in Guanyao and Fengpu, and another 3,000 Japanese soldiers were stationed in the southwest of Sanshui. On the 20th, they began launching an attack in three routes. One route advanced from Longkou Village in Huaxian and along the Yuehan Railway from Jiangcun towards Tangjin, reaching Xinjie and Hengtan on the 20th, and continued straight along the railway. After being intercepted by the Chinese army along the way and suffering heavy casualties, they used fierce artillery fire and aircraft to cover their advance. On the 21st, they captured Juntian and Qiling. On the morning of the 22nd, the vanguard of the Japanese troops reached the vicinity of Yinzhan'ao and Yokeng Bridge in the southwest. The Chinese army fiercely resisted, preventing the Japanese army from advancing north. They then moved west to join the Japanese army in Baini. On the morning of the 24th, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers from Longkou Village, under the cover of tanks, advanced along Guanghua Road, attempting to support the Japanese army on the railway. However, they were met by the Chinese army and were defeated and retreated. More than 3,000 Japanese soldiers, who were originally stationed at key points along the highway, attempted to harass Gutai and Xingren in the north, but were constantly attacked by the Chinese side, suffering heavy casualties. On the 24th, they retreated, and the Japanese army in Baini met with the Japanese army on the Yuehan Railway. More than 2,000 Japanese soldiers who invaded Lubao advanced from the southwest along the Luxi Highway via Yangmei, launching a fierce battle with the Chinese guerrillas in the area south of Huangtang, lasting a day and a night. The Japanese troops received reinforcements, and on the evening of the 21st, the Chinese and Japanese engaged in fierce clashes in Daitou, Lunlu, and Lukeng, resulting in casualties on both sides. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese used aircraft to bomb and assist in the battle. In order to avoid sacrifices, the Chinese side began to retreat to (illegible), engaging in mixed combat with the Japanese. The Japanese again sent reinforcements. Until late at night, the Chinese, in order to lure the Japanese deep, shifted their defense to Lubao, confronting the Japanese across the river. On the afternoon of the 23rd, Chinese reinforcements rushed to the scene, braving the rain of bullets to cross the river and launch a counterattack, immediately encircling and fiercely attacking the Japanese troops in Niulangang and Wushigang.

<h3>Three American Medical Experts Go to Yunnan to Eliminate Malaria: The National Government Allocates 1.8 Million Yuan as a Five-Year Fund for Malaria Elimination Work</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At the request of the Chinese government, the U.S. Public Health Service has sent three American medical experts to China. The three experts arrived here yesterday and are preparing to carry out the work of eliminating malaria in Yunnan. The three medical experts are: (1) Dr. Williams, Director of the Medical Department of the U.S. Public Health Service; (2) Dr. Meni, also a doctor of the U.S. Public Health Service; (3) Dr. Hubshire. At the same time, Dr. Brown, an American from the American Church Hospital, will also assist the three experts in the malaria elimination work in Yunnan. It is reported that the four medical doctors are scheduled to depart on December 1 for the malaria-stricken areas of Yunnan. Since the climate there is not very hot now, the experts plan to spend the winter there until the end of February next year. Although the travel and living expenses of the experts are borne by the United States, other expenses must be assumed by the Chinese side. Therefore, the Chinese government has allocated 1.8 million yuan as a five-year budget for the malaria elimination campaign. According to Dr. Brown, malaria in Yunnan is a major threat to the workers on the Yunnan-Burma Road, a situation that is exactly the same as the Panama epidemic encountered during the construction of the Panama Canal.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces the War Situation for One Week: From the 22nd to the 28th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission spoke about the increasingly fierce fighting in Guangdong and Guangxi since this week (November 22nd to 28th). On the remaining fronts, there have also been repeated fierce battles. Chinese soldiers and officers have bravely risked their lives and have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the Japanese army. In the future, wherever the Japanese set foot, they will inevitably sink deeper and deeper, and fall into a dilemma from which they cannot extricate themselves. Regarding the course of the battle, the more important aspects are described as follows:</p>
<p>(Guangdong and Guangxi): The Japanese army landing in Qinzhou Bay continued to advance north after arriving at the border between Guangdong and Guangxi last week. On the morning of the 23rd, a unit arrived in Liangqingxu, Yudong, Tongqingxu, and other places one after another, and was met with a head-on attack by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. It then sent three regiments to reinforce, and under the cover of machine guns and artillery, forcibly crossed the Yu River and launched a fierce attack on Nanning. The Chinese army fought bravely in hand-to-hand combat, fighting back and forth. The Japanese continued to send reinforcements, and the bloody battle lasted until the morning of the 26th. Because there was no defensible terrain from a tactical point of view, and the strategic goal of attrition had been achieved, the Chinese then moved to the suburbs of the city, and are currently encircling and annihilating the invading Japanese army. In addition, the Chinese army has been fiercely attacking the Japanese army in the Jiangmen area for days, achieving many victories. On the 25th and 26th, they twice attacked the city of Xinhui, burning down many Japanese barracks, warehouses, headquarters, and agencies. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Jiujiangxu on the 28th, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of spoils of war. As for the Japanese army on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, after entering Juntian and Baini, they launched separate attacks on Lubao to the west for days, and also attacked Yinzhan'ao to the north with a part of their forces, with a fierce offensive. The Chinese army resisted in separate locations, engaging in fierce battles for several days and nights, killing more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. The war has now reached a stalemate. The Japanese army trapped in Chao'an in eastern Guangdong used more than 800 infantry soldiers at dawn on the 25th, under the cover of machine guns and artillery, to launch an attack on Fengxi in two routes. After being intercepted in separate locations, the fierce battle lasted all day. In the evening, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Chaozhou City, abandoning more than 200 corpses.</p>
<p>(Shanxi and Henan): There were no large-scale battles in southeastern Shanxi. After the Chinese army recovered Xiangning, Daning, Puxian, and other places in western Shanxi, the remaining Japanese retreated and entrenched themselves in Heilongguan. For days, the Chinese army continued to attack fiercely, occupying various outer strongholds. On the 22nd, they once charged into the town, killing many Japanese soldiers. Another unit of the (illegible) army recovered Qingxiangzhen and forced an attack on Fenxi County, causing the Japanese to retreat in a panic, suffering heavy losses. Out of shame and anger, the Japanese then drew thousands of people from Lishi, Liulin, and Dawu, and launched a three-pronged attack on Qikouzhen, attempting to contain the Chinese army. One route followed the Lishi Highway to Meijiacha and is currently engaged in a fierce battle in the Wanglaoposhi area. One route harassed Mengmen (south of Qikou) from Liulin to the north, and was met with a head-on attack. One route divided from Dawuzhen and advanced via Dashancun and Maota Man, intending to attack Hujiata, but was intercepted by the Chinese garrison. The Japanese suffered hundreds of casualties. On the 24th, fierce battles raged all day on each route. By nightfall, the entire Japanese line was shaken and retreated in disarray. A small number of remaining Japanese were still closely besieged by the Chinese army and unable to break through. In eastern Henan, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese for days. A unit forced its way to the suburbs of Taikang on the morning of the 23rd, launching a siege. Another unit attacked the Caitun Station and the northwest of Kaifeng on the 27th, destroying many Japanese military vehicles and killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. In southern Henan, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers who were harassing Chenjiadian from the area of Xinyang and Changtaiguan were repeatedly attacked, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese retreated along the original route, and the Chinese army is currently attacking. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Villages Along the Ping Sui Railway Completely Burned</h3>
<p>Wuyuan: The Japanese army in Sui recently ordered the residents within four or five miles of the Pingsui Railway to relocate completely. All the villages along the southern foothills of Daqing Mountain, from Zhuozishan in the east to Baotou in the west, were burned to the ground in order to encircle Daqing Mountain and prevent the Chinese army from advancing east. Currently, thirteen of the seventeen villages affiliated with Renhex township near the Tao Wuqi Station in eastern Sui have been cleared by the Japanese army. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>

<h3>Molotov Announces to the Soviet People, Denouncing the Finnish Government for Retrogressive Actions, Still Willing to Guarantee Finnish Independence and Autonomy</h3>
<p>Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, broadcast a speech late on the 29th, saying, "Male and female citizens of the Soviet Union, the hostile policies adopted by the current Finnish government towards our country have forced us to take direct steps to ensure the security of our country's borders. As you all know, for two months, our government has been negotiating with the Finnish government, discussing with patience various proposals to ensure the minimum security of our country, especially Leningrad, in the current international panic situation. Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Finnish government adopted a firm hostile attitude towards our country. Not only did it not seek coordination in a friendly manner, but it also took retrogressive actions, flattering the imperialist powers that instigated anti-Soviet sentiments. Disregarding all the concessions made by our country, it ultimately led to the fruitless breakdown of negotiations. As a result, the Finnish border warlords have recently begun to brazenly provoke, even shelling our troops near Leningrad, causing the death and injury of many of our soldiers. Our government still adhered to the principle of settling matters peacefully and offered practical suggestions to the Finnish government, hoping to prevent the continued occurrence of provocative incidents. However, the Finnish rulers still responded with hostile policies, as stated in the government's reply published yesterday. They even used hostile rejections, shameless denials of facts, insults to our country's victims, and a blatant attempt to permanently place Leningrad under the threat of their army to repay our country's suggestions. All of this clearly shows that the current Finnish government still firmly maintains a hostile attitude towards our country, is unwilling to abide by the provisions of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between the two countries, and is determined to keep our Leningrad permanently under the threat of their military force. From this government and its utterly irrational warlords, there is nothing else to hope for other than new barbaric provocations. Therefore, our government was forced to declare yesterday that the Soviet Union would no longer accept the binding of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Non-Aggression, which had been destroyed by the Finnish government itself. Furthermore, because the Finnish warlords continued to attack the Soviet troops on the border, our government had to make new decisions. Our government cannot tolerate the current situation, and the entire responsibility should be borne by the Finnish government. Our government has now decided that it cannot continue to maintain normal diplomatic relations with the Finnish government, and has ordered the immediate recall of all political and economic representatives stationed in Finland. In addition, the government has also ordered the general headquarters of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force to prepare for any unexpected events and to immediately stop any possible new attacks by the Finnish warlords. Foreign newspapers hostile to our country have falsely claimed that the steps we have taken are aimed at seizing Finnish territory. This is purely malicious slander. The Soviet government has absolutely no such intention. On the contrary, if Finland itself pursues a friendly policy towards our country, the Soviet government, which has always strived for friendship with Finland, is still willing to negotiate and compromise at any time, and is even willing to cede its own territory to that country. In this regard, the Soviet government is willing to consider in good faith the reunification of the Karelian people currently living in the main areas of Soviet Karelia with the Finnish people of the same race in a single, independent Finland, and other similar issues. However, this must be conditional on the Finnish government abandoning its hostility towards the Soviet Union and adopting a friendly attitude that is in line with the interests of both countries. Others have also falsely claimed that the steps we have taken are aimed at harming Finnish independence and interfering in its domestic and foreign affairs. This is also malicious slander. Regardless of the Finnish political system, we have always recognized it as an independent and autonomous country in its domestic and foreign affairs. We firmly believe that the Finnish people should decide all their domestic and foreign affairs themselves. The Soviet people have helped Finland gain independence in the past, and will continue to assist the people of that country in guaranteeing their free and independent development in the future. The Soviet Union has no intention of harming the interests of other countries in Finland. The relationship between Finland and other countries is purely its own affair, and the Soviet Union has no right to interfere. The purpose of the steps taken by our country is purely to guarantee the security of the Soviet Union, especially Leningrad, which has a population of 3.5 million. In the current international atmosphere heated by war, we cannot allow the decision on this important national issue to depend on the malice of the current Finnish rulers. This issue must be resolved by the Soviet Union itself and in friendly cooperation with the Finnish people. Once the issue of guaranteeing the security of Leningrad is resolved in a satisfactory manner, the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Finland will be able to obtain a permanent foundation of friendship. This can be asserted with certainty." (Telegraph from TASS on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Recalls Envoys to Finland</h3>
<p>Moscow: Bogdan Kim, Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, acting on government instructions, personally handed a note signed by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to Finnish Minister Yeke Kinnan yesterday. The note declared that the Soviet government believed that it could not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Finland because of the continuous incursions of Finnish troops into Soviet territory, and had therefore decided to recall all political and economic representatives stationed in Finland.

<h3>Finland's Range of Concessions to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>London: A Finnish official spokesman told a United Press reporter last night that the Finnish government would cede the Eastern Ge Island near Leningrad to the Soviet Union, but Finland could not make further concessions that would undermine its existing defense works.

<h3>French Parliament Reconvenes: Daladier Reports on the War Situation, Asserts That the Strength of Britain and France Is Sufficient to Ensure Victory; The Key to Victory Lies in the Increase and Decrease of Moral Strength</h3>
<p>Paris: Prime Minister Daladier and his cabinet colleague (illegible), earlier today, read government statements in the House and Senate respectively. They stated briefly, "French soldiers have answered the call of the nation and gone to the front with firm determination. For nearly three months, they have been able to fight with the same enthusiasm, selfless sacrifice, freedom, rights, personality, and general sense of justice on all three fronts: land, sea, and air. As far as land is concerned, our troops are demonstrating their power every day, proving their value. As far as the sky is concerned, the air forces of both Britain and France have defeated the enemy. As far as the sea is concerned, the fleets of Britain and France have contained the offensive of the enemy submarines. The reason why Germany has resumed mine warfare to strike at the ships of Britain, France, and neutral countries is probably because of this. As for the war situation, it has already reversed our expectations. The enemy is defending behind the (illegible) defensive fortifications and has concentrated a large number of troops to prepare for mobile warfare. The troops of Britain and France can also work together, and are sufficient to deter the enemy from wherever they attack. One thing must be explained to the people of the country: although the way this war is being waged is not what we expected, it is not unfavorable to us. This is something that our soldiers are well aware of. Even if the war reports issued by the Commander-in-Chief say that the front line is calm and uneventful, we are already sufficient to bring about victory with strong, persistent, and resolute actions, to make it come as soon as possible, and to reduce the number of casualties to a minimum. Moreover, the key to victory or defeat depends not only on military actions, but also on the evolution of international politics and the increase and decrease of moral strength. Since September 2 of this year, Poland has been tragically divided. The strong connection between Britain and France is for the final victory. Some aspects have fabricated rumors that the sacrifices made by Britain and France in this war are unequal. This is a futile effort. As far as the international situation is concerned, Turkey has signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Britain and France on October 19 of this year, which has contributed greatly to maintaining peace in the Balkan Peninsula. US President Roosevelt issued an appeal to Germany and Poland in August of this year, advocating the establishment of a fair solution. Such noble actions are commendable. Later, the US Congress passed the New Neutrality Act, repealing the arms embargo clauses. Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical on October 27 of this year, emphasizing that international relations should be based on respect for the national rights of all countries and respect for existing treaties.

<h3>Communist Party Members Forcibly Enter the Venue, Obstructing Daladier's Speech</h3>
<p>Paris: After the House of Representatives reconvened this morning, Speaker Herriot delivered a speech paying tribute to the soldiers at the front. All members of parliament stood in silence. Prime Minister Daladier then read the government declaration. When he reached the middle of his speech, two Communist Party members, Pondet and Guelnam, suddenly broke into the venue. Because the Communist Party in this country had already been dissolved, the members of parliament stood up to oppose them. The Prime Minister had no choice but to stop speaking until the police removed the two Communist Party members from the venue, after which he continued to read the declaration. After listening to the declaration, the members of parliament unanimously approved it. The Prime Minister then mentioned the close cooperation between Britain and France, and the efforts of US President (illegible) to maintain peace. The members of parliament applauded warmly. Finally, the Prime Minister also said, "Traitors will never be allowed to break into Parliament." In addition, when the Senate reconvened this morning, Speaker Jananan delivered a speech, the general idea of which was the same as that of House Speaker Herriot. Afterwards, Cabinet Secretary (illegible) read the government declaration. The Senate then decided to continue the (illegible) at 10 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Naval Minister of France Announces: Germany Has Lost More Than Thirty Submarines, Accounting For Over Fifty Percent of Its Total Number; Over 200,000 Tons of Contraband Intercepted</h3>
<p>Paris: Naval Minister Campinchi recently made a speech to various newspapers, discussing Germany's submarine and mine warfare, as well as countermeasures. He stated that since the beginning of the war, Germany has lost about thirty submarines, which is more than fifty percent of its total submarine fleet. In recent days alone, three submarines have been sunk, one of which was sunk by a seaplane. Over the past twenty years, although submarine construction has been repeatedly improved, mainly in terms of engines and weapons, their speed has not increased, and their vulnerability remains the same. Conversely, defensive measures have greatly improved. During the last European war, Germany had one hundred and fifty submarines, of which only twenty-one were sunk by the Allied Powers, accounting for only fourteen percent of the total. Compared to the current sinking rate, the difference is immeasurable. Furthermore, the tonnage of British and French ships sunk by German submarines and mines is only four hundred thousand tons. Recently, Germany has been using magnetic mines, and Britain and France are now finding ways to remove them. It should be known that when new weapons appear, defensive measures also arise accordingly. As for the blockade, within the first sixty-eight days of the war, the British and French navies intercepted 223,000 tons of contraband bound for Germany. In short, all the measures taken by our navy are effective and promising. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare recently announced that the British Navy inspected 134 merchant ships during the week of November 19th to 25th, including twenty-one Italian ships, twenty-eight Norwegian ships, nineteen Dutch ships, twenty British ships, and fifteen Greek ships. Ninety-seven of these ships have been released. In addition, our military</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Opposes Changing the Status Quo; Hungarian Foreign Minister Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Foreign Minister Gafencu delivered an important speech in the Senate today, explaining foreign policy, stating: "This European war has no impact on our country's interests, independence, and territorial integrity. Therefore, we have strictly adhered to neutrality from the beginning. However, if our country is threatened, we will defend our territory with all our strength. Our foreign policy has always been to cooperate with other countries. We have signed commercial agreements with Britain and France, and these countries also guarantee our country's independence. We have been able to redouble our efforts to promote friendly relations with our neighbors. As for the Soviet Union, we firmly believe that there is no conflict between the destinies of our two nations. Therefore, we have paid close attention to the negotiations previously conducted by the Soviet Union and Turkey. Although these negotiations have been temporarily suspended, the friendly relations between the two sides remain intact, which is gratifying. As for Italy, in accordance with its historical mission, it strives to preserve the order of Europe, preventing it from being destroyed by war. It will surely have a profound and positive impact on Eastern Europe. As for Hungary, the Hungarian government expressed concern to our country on August 24th this year due to our country's strengthening of border defenses. I immediately provided a concrete answer, willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with it. Although the Hungarian authorities have not yet submitted a reply, the Balkan Entente countries have already decided on various principles at their meeting last year. Our country will naturally continue to seek a compromise with Hungary based on these principles. The content of the Treaty of Trianon (the peace treaty with Hungary after the last European War) is not unfair. It only reorganized Hungary before the last European War, that is, a country composed of several ethnic minorities under the control of one ethnic group, and replaced it with a nation-based country. That is all. Hungary has already accepted this view regarding Yugoslavia, and it is hoped that it will adopt the same attitude towards our country in the future. But in any case, the current situation cannot be changed at this time." (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: After Foreign Minister Gafencu explained foreign policy in the Senate yesterday, Professor Yaulga, a legal advisor and senator, gave a speech stating that although Poland has fallen, it will surely be restored. He also expressed gratitude for the guarantee of our country's existing borders by Britain and France. "We must not forget this spirit of chivalry from Britain and France when the war is over. At that time, the rights of all countries will be upheld. In the past, Germany suffered greatly and took a long time to complete its unification. It should understand this," he said. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Regarding the statement by Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu that the Treaty of Trianon is not unfair and should not be revised, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky made a speech to the Hungarian News Agency, commenting: "At this time, it is no longer possible for the Romanian authorities to insist on this statement. For the sake of peace in our country and Central Europe, I must protest against anyone who wants to revive the spirit of the various peace treaties of the last European War. I am convinced that any impartial international body will consider the Treaty of Trianon to be unfair and in need of urgent revision. In short, if Romania continues to regard itself as a beneficiary of the last European War, then security and peace in the Carpathian Mountains will be difficult to ensure," he said.

<h3>Stalin Refutes Rumors, Says "Havas News Agency Café Politicians" Distort Facts and Close Doors to Build Cars (Fabricate)</h3>
<p>Moscow: The editor of Pravda recently wrote to Stalin, saying: "Havas News Agency recently released a message stating that Stalin gave a speech at the Politburo on August 19th," in which Stalin said, "The war should be prolonged as much as possible so that both belligerent parties are exhausted." I wonder what Mr. Stalin's opinion is on this message." Stalin personally replied, "This message from Havas News Agency is completely fabricated, like many other messages from that agency. I cannot know where this rumor was fabricated in a café, but no matter how Havas News Agency fabricates rumors, they cannot deny the following points, namely: First, Germany did not attack Britain and France, but Britain and France attacked Germany, thereby taking responsibility for this war; Second, after the outbreak of the war, Germany still made peace proposals to Britain and France, and the Soviet Union publicly supported them, because the Soviet Union has always believed that an early end to the war would fundamentally ease the situation of all countries; Third, the ruling class of Britain and France have brazenly rejected Germany's peace proposals and the Soviet Union's efforts to end the war early. All of the above are facts. How can the café politicians of Havas News Agency deny them?" (TASS dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: After receiving news that the Soviet Union was concentrating large armies in Central Asia and the Caucasus, political figures here are paying close attention. Public opinion is focusing on discussing the Soviet Union's motives for taking this step. The general opinion is that the purpose of this military measure by the Soviet Union is to deal with France's increase in troops in Syria, Britain's increase in troops in Egypt, and Turkey's increase in troops in Eastern Anatolia.

<h3>Japan Negotiates Commercial Treaty with France</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Trade between Japan and France is based on the Japan-France Provisional Commercial Agreement concluded in June of this year. However, since the outbreak of the European War, France has restricted important exports and imports, making it difficult to implement the agreement in practice. Therefore, there has been talk between the two countries about a new treaty. The Japanese government recently inquired with the French government about the limits on the amount of important French products to be supplied to Japan in the future, and the possible scope of Japanese purchases of French goods. As a result, the two countries are scheduled to begin formal negotiations next month to conclude a new commercial treaty. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th) We have not yet launched anything, so we have not reached a large-scale and fierce level. This matter is fought for our safety and freedom, is force majeure. In addition to invading Poland, Germany also wants to establish hegemony in Europe with a systematic will, sometimes in the name of racism, and sometimes in disregard of this doctrine, so that other nations become vassals. The creed we pursue is to cherish life and reduce suffering, while at the same time hoarding various powerful weapons with all our strength, so as to fully grasp and minimize losses, defeat Germany's future offensive, and achieve victory. We not only retain the Maginot Line, but also countless lines of defense and barriers and outposts, in order to protect our country's territory like never before. The two countries not only have the same ideals and interests, but also coordinate all moral, material and military resources. The two countries have hesitated in the past, and their opinions have been divided for many years. Today, a true alliance has been established. The results obtained from this are far from what could be achieved during the last European War. When the joint meeting of the highest national defense committees of the two countries was held on the 17th of this month, a large-scale plan for joint action in all aspects was adopted. In short, the political and military front lines of Britain and France have the unlimited resources of the two major empires as their backing. This strong group has the determination to overcome all difficulties and will surely achieve a victory. Lini has also made many efforts to maintain peace. The country's policies in the past three months have made great contributions to maintaining peace in the Mediterranean. In addition, the relationship between France and Spain has also improved. France's diplomatic situation is as described above, and Germany's isolation in the world can also be seen from this. Britain and France use force only to prevent others from abusing force, and will not lay down their arms until the unfair treatment suffered by someone is corrected. All European countries have the right to maintain security, and the security system must be strengthened and promoted to all countries in Europe. As far as the present is concerned, we must first achieve victory, and what we should devote all our efforts to is that." (Havas dispatch on the 30th) Continue the meeting.

<p>Paris: French Communist Party Congressman Zidong, who once served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Party, was dissolved by the government after the outbreak of the war, and party members were arrested. Zidong was also among them. He recently surrendered to the police authorities, saying that he no longer belongs to any party and is prepared to issue a public statement.

<h3>German Plane Lands in Danish Territory</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: A German plane was recently forced to land in the Faroe Islands, a Danish territory. The Danish authorities have detained it and arrested four pilots. (Havas dispatch on the 30th), on average, is far less than in 1917 (when the average was 500,000 tons per month). Germany has failed to win by submarine warfare in the past, let alone now. At this time, Britain and France have prepared sound defenses, the tonnage of ships sunk has been greatly reduced, and the number of German submarines sunk has been increasing day by day. Even if all the shipyards in the country devote all their efforts to building submarines, they will not be able to create a sufficient number before September 1940 to pose a serious threat to us. As for mine warfare, during the last European War, Germany laid mines all over the sea without issuing a notice. According to the data in 1917, 6 million tons of ships were destroyed, of which ships were hit. During the same period, more than 11,000 tons of goods were intercepted to Germany, of which 11,000 tons were kerosene. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Parin: Germany is paying close attention to the opposition of neutral countries to the new British and French blockade policy. Responsible persons here believe that this new blockade measure is in retaliation for Germany's torpedo warfare, and the result is nothing less than expanding the blockade policy to the shipping industry of neutral countries. Moreover, Germany's torpedo warfare is not an illegal act, but is permitted by international law. On the contrary, the retaliatory measures taken by Britain and France have no legal basis and violate the Declaration of Paris. According to the declaration, enemy goods transported by neutral countries that are not wartime contraband should not be confiscated (Haitong</p>

<h3>Britain's Annual War Expenses: 2.4 Billion Pounds; Two-Thirds More Than Last War; Simon Calls on the Whole Country to Donate</h3>
<p>London: Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the funds used by Britain for war and other matters currently amount to 2,400,000,000 pounds per year, which is two-thirds more than the expenses of the last war. The annual tax revenue is 1,000,000,000 pounds, and another 1,000,000,000 pounds must be raised to meet this year's expenditures. If the war progresses throughout the year, with more ammunition and more lives lost, the expenses required will be even greater. The current annual expenditure rate is about half of the total income of the people. There are 10,000 people in the country with an annual income of 10,000 pounds or more, and their total income amounts to 180,000,000 pounds. However, this amount is only enough to maintain the country's war for a week or ten days. Property tax has already obtained 160,000,000 pounds from this amount. The general public believes that heavily taxing the rich can solve the financial problems during the war. From this, an answer can be obtained, that is, the rich have already borne a very heavy burden and have no surplus capacity to raise funds. Therefore, the only way for a democratic country to cope with such terrible war expenses is for the people of the whole country to voluntarily donate. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Review War Goals</h3>
<p>Berlin: The "German General Newspaper" and "People's Observer" here both published editorials today, reviewing Germany's war goals, which are generally regarded as instructed by senior political figures. The "German General Newspaper" declared that the goal of Germany's war is to liberate Europe under British hegemony. If Britain does not insist on continuing to disturb the natural balance of Europe, then the Treaty of Versailles will not be signed. Europe liberated from British hegemony is a stable Europe with a natural balance of all countries. This is the fixed goal of Hitler's foreign policy, which will seek the boundaries of the scope of influence of all parties. This boundary has been agreed by Italy and the Soviet Union. If Britain does not use force as a tool to determine the fate of Europe, then France and the British Empire will also express their agreement. The "People's Observer" declared that Britain's continental blockade policy is a method of terror, and Germany's mission is to liberate Europe from Britain's arbitrary control.

<h3>Germany's Petroleum Mostly Used Up</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Times today carried an article stating that Germany's complete isolation from the world's major oil markets can be seen in official statistics and other news. According to news obtained from Washington, Germany consumed most of its prepared gasoline when it attacked Poland. Since then, it has been unable to make large-scale supplements. This situation may prove the reason why the British and French air forces have no German troops flying in formation and the German army has not taken an offensive on the Western Front. The United States exported a total of 7 million barrels of crude oil and 4 million barrels of gasoline in September. According to the figures for October, Germany did not receive any oil, and the situation in November is likely to be similar. According to official intelligence, the Soviet Union is also unable to take care of its oil production and may not be able to provide Germany with large-scale assistance.

<h3>British and German Machines in Fierce Air Combat</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to official announcements here, a German reconnaissance plane engaged in fierce air combat with a British fighter plane in Northumberland, England, yesterday. The German reconnaissance plane was flying at a high altitude when it suddenly saw a British fighter plane appear in the clouds, closely following and continuously firing machine guns. The German plane was hit by several bullets, but did not damage any vital parts. The British plane chased to a distance of fifty meters, and a fierce battle ensued. As a result, the Central Plane abandoned the chase, and the German plane returned safely. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Director of the German War History Research Institute Discusses the Command of Modern Armies</h3>
<p>Berlin: Colonel Forster, Director of the German War History Research Institute, gave a speech in Breslau yesterday entitled "The Qualifications of Leaders of Modern Armies," stating that General Moltke, the predecessor, created the leader of the modern army. Since then, the superior position of the army leader commanding the war has ceased to exist. In Germany's war in Poland this time, the army leaders were able to make good use of the army's technological development to complete their tasks. Although the army's combat technology has changed, the principle of leadership command is still based on Moltke's theory. As for the situation on the Western Front, a large-scale positional war has not yet begun, but modern war tactics are different from the last great war. In addition to military weapons, it is also necessary to use diplomacy, politics, economy, and spirit, and concentrate the strength of all aspects to engage in modern warfare.

<h3>US Public Opinion Towards Japan Increasingly Worsens; Unanimous Opposition to the "New Order in East Asia"; Churches Demand a Ban on Arms Shipments to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun director Suzuki, who was traveling in the United States, telegraphed the newspaper yesterday, confirming that after US Ambassador to Japan Grew recently delivered a speech to the Japanese people in Tokyo, US public opinion has unanimously opposed Japan's "New Order in East Asia." According to Suzuki's telegram, "US public opinion towards Japan is extremely bad and is likely to worsen further." Although there are currently two factions in US public opinion towards Japan, both oppose Japan's "New Order in East Asia." The first faction advocates taking a tough policy towards Japan and economic sanctions to retaliate against "Japan's infringement of US interests in China." The second faction advocates taking a more moderate policy, but demands that Japan reopen the Yangtze River and guarantee that it will respect US interests in China in the future.

<p>Cincinnati: Bishop Hobson here wrote to the South Ohio Episcopal Church, calling the United States' sale of weapons and military supplies to Japan "the greatest stain in American history." Bishop Hobson urged church leaders to write to state congressional representatives and Secretary of State Hull, requesting a cessation of trade with Japan. Bishop Hobson also said that the United States expresses sympathy to China on the one hand, donating money to relieve people suffering from the war, and supplying Japan with weapons on the other hand, which is hypocritical.

<h3>Japanese Currency Increasingly Inflated; Banknote Issue Reaches New Record</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to a survey by the Bank of Japan on the 30th, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan was 2.923 billion yen, breaking the highest record of 2.838 billion yen in December last year. The amount of issues outside its restrictions also reached 221 million yen. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>British Blockade of German Trade Disadvantageous to Japan; Negotiations Still Underway; Japanese Navy Makes No Comment</h3>
<p>Tokyo: When Navy Department spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa greeted newspaper reporters this morning, a foreign reporter asked what action the Japanese Navy would take if the British Navy discovered German exports on Japanese ships and confiscated them. The spokesman replied that he only learned from newspaper reports that Britain would begin blockading German exports on December 4. This matter is currently in diplomatic talks between Britain and Japan, and he cannot disclose the attitude of the Japanese Navy. However, Japan should, of course, uphold its rights as a neutral country. Japan should take a firm stance on this matter. According to his opinion, today's editorials in the Jiji Shinpo and Yomiuri Shimbun, urging the government to take "strong countermeasures against British and French shipping when the British and French confiscate German exports carried by Japanese ships," reflect Japanese sentiment. When a British reporter asked whether the Japanese Navy could in principle not recognize the British blockade of German exports, Kanazawa replied that as a naval officer, he could easily understand the motives and countermeasures planned by the British Navy to deal with German mines and submarine warfare. However, because the Japanese government has declared a policy of non-interference in the European War, and because retaliatory and confrontational actions have the danger of producing serious consequences, as proven by the United States being drawn into the last great war, he will not give a definite answer here. Today's Yomiuri Shimbun editorial stated that merchants and shipping companies are demanding that the government take "strong action." If Japanese ships are detained, or German exports carried by Japanese ships are confiscated by the British and French authorities, the Japanese government should retaliate against British and French shipping. The actions of the British and French governments are a violation of public law, and the Japanese government also views it as such. If Japanese ships are detained, the Japanese authorities will have reason to detain Central French ships or confiscate British and French goods at Japanese and Chinese ports. According to Japanese sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura told British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie this morning that Japan will adhere to its established policy, as notified to Britain on November 24, and will not agree to Britain's confiscation of German exports on the high seas. Japan takes this attitude because it fears that interests vital to Japan's survival will be affected by this move by Britain. Japanese sources also said that the meeting between Craigie and Nomura was held at 11:30 this morning, when the British ambassador handed over a formal reply to the Japanese protest of November 24 and indicated that the British government intended to give full consideration to taking cautious measures to avoid possible damage to neutral countries when implementing the decision to confiscate German exports. The British Embassy has not confirmed this news. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>

After various arrangements, the work will be actively promoted according to the two principles of urgent relief and gradual relief. (Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>American Highway Expert Talks Freely About the General Situation of Transportation in China; Highway Transportation in Guangxi is Obstructed Due to the War, But the Impact on Resource Input is Minimal</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since the outbreak of war in Guangxi, the highway leading from Nanning to the border of French Vietnam has been temporarily blocked. The impact of this on China's access to external resources has been a matter of great concern. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed American highway expert Xue Heng on this matter, who said that although the highway to Nanning is temporarily suspended due to the war in the nearby area, and the input of resources through that route is temporarily blocked, judging from the current overall transportation situation of your country, the temporary blockage of this line has minimal impact. Now that the rainy season is over, your country can import large quantities of goods without restriction via a certain location by highway, and the facilities along that route are far more advanced than those on the Nanning highway. In South China, the rainy season this year brought unprecedented heavy rainfall. Even the railway in Myanmar was temporarily suspended, but your country's Dian-Sha Highway continued to operate as usual without any obstruction. I personally witnessed ten or twenty landslides on this new highway in just one section, but traffic continued to flow smoothly, and large quantities of goods continued to be transported into the interior through this route. Your country's roads are well-connected in all directions, so there is absolutely no problem with the import of foreign goods. The highway from Nanning is just one section of the overall network, and it has not been repaired in any way for several months. With the outbreak of the war in Guangxi, this road is fundamentally unusable. In recent days, the residents of Guangxi have been using the method of diverting water to restore the road to its pre-construction state, so the Japanese army is also unable to use it. The branch and main roads in various parts of South China are interconnected, so goods can be transported, which is a major feature of road administration in South China. In Guangxi, it will only take a few weeks to find a way to connect the branch roads and old roads in various places, and it will become an ideal passage, only with more curves and longer distances. The roadbeds of these old roads are mostly stone slabs, which your country has used to drive livestock and transport people and goods for centuries. The plan now is to lift the stone slabs, place them on both sides, and then pave them with gravel and fine sand so that cars can pass. The construction of the southwest highways in your country was completed extremely quickly, thanks to the old roads. Moreover, there is another new highway in Guangxi that will be completed by the end of December. Using the old road is only a contingency measure. Your country has been planning to build new highways for a long time, and now they are about to be completed and can be used to replace the old highways. The new highway is several hundred kilometers shorter than the old highway from the border to Hechi in northern Guangxi. The roadbed of the new highway is much smoother than the old highway, and there are fewer curves. The entire project is far more perfect. In addition, there are at least four more highways currently under construction. In general, road administration in the southwest is progressing extremely rapidly. Under the leadership of Minister Zhang Jia'ao, the Ministry of Communications is constantly seeking to improve the transportation efficiency and speed of China, implementing centralized management to unify transportation. The previous determination to experiment with the use of improved wooden boats, equipped with American motors, to facilitate transportation was successful and is commendable. Furthermore, the Ministry of Communications has now stipulated that highways should be divided into several sections, and drivers are only responsible for driving certain sections and do not have to drive the entire route. With this improvement, the 24-hour driving system on the southwest highways should be able to be implemented, it is said. According to reports, within this year, the Ministry of Communications has made every effort to improve or rebuild various important highways across the country, and at the same time, it has also sought to unify road administration in various places and implement centralized management, so that it can conform to economic principles and efficiency can also be improved. This matter has received much assistance and support from American highway experts such as Xue Heng. Xue Heng previously inspected road administration in the southwest and worked extremely hard. Judging from the various points he described, it can be seen that a new era in the history of our country's highways is not far away. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>After the Outbreak of the European War, Overseas Chinese in Nanyang Get New Opportunities; The Amount of Remittances from Overseas Chinese to Fujian is Very Large; Nanyang Abolishes Restrictions on the Import of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the surge in foreign exchange rates, Fujianese compatriots residing in Nanyang have been enthusiastically remitting funds back home. In the southern Fujian area alone, the average monthly remittance of overseas Chinese funds has reached a huge sum of 8 million yuan. In addition to maintaining the lives of overseas Chinese families, most of these remittances are used to purchase farmland or build houses. Some are even hoarded at home, or even indulge in gambling, which not only violates economic principles but also degrades the morality of the people. The provincial government has now issued a proclamation to guide three uses of overseas remittances: (1) Purchase government bonds or make national construction savings; (2) Deposit in banks for ordinary fixed or current savings; (3) Purchase fields and gardens, or invest in land reclamation and various productive vegetable businesses. In this way, the capital is both reliable and profitable, and the hard-earned money of overseas Chinese can be kept rich forever. It has been found that in Yongchun, Nan'an, Jinjiang and other counties in southern Fujian, the price of farmland has soared due to the excessive number of overseas Chinese dependents purchasing it. In Yongchun, the mortgage price of farmland was only 20 or 30 yuan per "jinzhong" (unit of land), but it has now risen to 60 or 70 yuan. The selling price was previously only 120 or 130 yuan per "jinzhong," but it has now risen to 270 or 280 yuan. In Nan'an, the mortgage price per "douzhong" (unit of land) was only 40 or 50 yuan, but it has now risen to around 100 yuan. The selling price was previously 160 or 170 yuan, but it has now risen to 700 or 800 yuan. The price increase is especially high for land near the city (mostly used for building houses) and fertile land. Buyers mostly want to sever all ties, while sellers only want to meet their current urgent needs, so they all want to retain the right to redeem the land. Therefore, the price increase for selling is much greater than for mortgaging. For example, in Putou and Furong villages in the third district of Nan'an County, each "douzhong" of farmland has been sold for 1,000 yuan, which is a particularly abnormal development. As for the situation in Nanyang, according to those who have recently returned to Fujian from Singapore, the price of rubber, the largest product in Nanyang, has been declining for years. Each "dan" (unit of weight) is only worth more than 30 yuan. If it is sold according to the market price, it is only enough to cover the wages of harvesting workers. Therefore, there are very few transactions on the market, which has a huge impact on other industries. Even all copper, tin, iron and other mineral products have mostly stopped being mined, so many Chinese workers have lost their jobs. The local government then restricted the import of Chinese people. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the price of rubber suddenly soared by 5 yuan per unit in one day. Since then, the market has been getting better every day. Now each "dan" has risen to more than 60 yuan, and market transactions have suddenly become active. Due to the war, the various hardware and minerals such as copper, tin, iron and lead are also being actively mined. For a time, there was a huge need for labor. The Chinese workers who had previously lost their jobs were all hired, and it was still not enough. Therefore, in addition to expanding recruitment, it is also appropriate to announce the opening up of the import of Chinese and various Asian people without restrictions. At present, all kinds of businesses in Nanyang have improved. Even the price of rice and beans in Myanmar has risen due to the purchase of foreign goods and the accumulation of military supplies. Chinese merchants in various places have expanded their operations, and rubber plantations that have been abandoned for a long time are all being harvested or reorganized. Remittances have also been more than before. No fewer than 3,000 or 4,000 people from southern Fujian go abroad to make a living every month (these people going abroad must be approved for a certificate after the local government has verified that they have no military service relationship). It has been found that these people going abroad all board ships in Quanzhou and go abroad after spending one or two nights in Gulangyu. Most of them are taken by the Japanese to Xiamen for interrogation. The same is true for those returning to China from Nanyang via Gulangyu, in an attempt to connect with overseas Chinese, prosper Xiamen Island, and establish an overseas Chinese association in Xiamen as an organ for wooing. Overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country mostly regard Gulangyu as a dangerous place. The American merchant Atlantic Steamship Company has now sent a special ship to sail directly to Quanzhou and the Philippines, without stopping at Gulangyu, to avoid being detained. Its first ship, the "Da Meihang," arrived in Quanzhou from the Philippines on the 18th and will be able to take passengers to the Philippines on the 21st.</p>
<h3>There Are Only 500 Japanese Troops in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops in Suzhou City was at most five or six thousand. Since the beginning of this month, after most of them were transferred to Hunan and Jiangxi to fight, there are very few remaining. On the 24th, the Hirose unit held a ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of its establishment. There were only 500 Japanese soldiers participating in the exercise on the large parade ground, which is sufficient to prove its emptiness. Therefore, vigilance has recently been implemented, and Chinese coolies are prohibited from entering to work, so as not to know its inside story. Late at night on the 23rd, the Chinese army in the suburbs of the county attacked the town of Lumu, five kilometers from the city, again. When the Chinese army rushed to the town, the puppet police personnel fled far away upon hearing the news. Therefore, the Chinese army destroyed the puppet office. That night, Zhu Jiting, the puppet village director of the town, telegraphed the Japanese army for help, but the Japanese army did not dare to go, and only fired rifles indiscriminately in the area outside Qidou. The Chinese army also returned to its original defense because it did not encounter the Japanese army. The Japanese army here, because the Chinese army is very active in the Taihu Lake area, built the Mu-Xu Highway (Mudu-Xukou) specifically in Xukou (the entrance to Taihu Lake in Wu County). The entire road is four kilometers long and five meters wide, connecting Xukou to Mudu, and then connecting to the Su-Mu Highway (Suzhou-Mudu). They also built a watchtower and a fortress outside the town of Xukou to strengthen their defense.</p>

<h3>Japan Seeks New Outlets for Goods to the Philippines; The Quantity of Goods Posing as Chinese Goods is Very Large; The Overseas Chinese Are Planning a Boycott</h3>
<p>Manila Correspondence: After the outbreak of the European War, the number of Japanese goods shipped to Europe decreased greatly, and the goods from European belligerent countries such as Britain and Germany shipped to the Philippines were also not as many as in the past. In order to remedy the loss of reduced shipments to Europe and to seize the markets of Britain, France and other countries in the Philippines, the Japanese tried every means to find a new outlet for Japanese goods in the Philippines, especially cloth. However, the Japanese were constrained by the Gentlemen's Agreement between the United States and Japan, and the import of Japanese cloth could not exceed a fixed quota. Therefore, they came up with a clever idea to smuggle Japanese goods into the Philippines as Chinese goods, which were not restricted, and could also take advantage of the patriotic psychology of overseas Chinese to deceive the overseas Chinese community for profit. They transported cloth manufactured in factories in Japan or in occupied areas to Hong Kong or Shanghai, re-labeled them with the trademarks of certain Chinese manufacturers, and then came to the Philippines for sale. Hong Kong is a free port, and Japanese goods can pass through without hindrance. As for Shanghai, China previously had a commodity inspection bureau, but it has been temporarily suspended since the Chinese army withdrew. Therefore, Japanese goods can be transported to Shanghai as they please. Since September of this year, Japanese goods posing as Chinese goods have been entering the Philippines in large quantities. The Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association reported this and set up a boycott subcommittee to investigate and boycott. It has been found that hundreds of boxes of "fake national cloth" have already been shipped in, and the quantity is extremely alarming. There are more than 100 boxes in the American "Meiya" (boat name) currently docked at the pier that have not yet been unloaded, and it is said that there are also 300 boxes on the "Victoria," "President Cleveland," "Japanese Empress," and other ships that will be shipped to the Philippines for dumping one after another.</p>
<p>The Japanese are faking many kinds of Chinese national cloth. The main ones are: Juniman (red plain bottom), Wuyi (black plain bottom), Yiyigeluluo, Gedunya, Baiyi, printed fabric, and cheap Jiabu cloth. The Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association's boycott subcommittee has now carefully studied the various fake Chinese cloth shipped to the Philippines. On the one hand, it is trying to crack down on counterfeit and inferior goods. On the other hand, it is protecting the genuine national goods produced by Chinese manufacturers, because most of the Chinese cotton textile factories in Shanghai are large factories with strong capital.</p>
<p>Chen Rongyu, the director of the boycott subcommittee of the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association, yesterday convened the Fuhe Cloth Merchants Association, the China Cloth Merchants Association, and overseas Chinese merchants from Houjiezai at the Anti-Japanese Association office to discuss countermeasures in order to prevent the dumping of "fake national cloth" in the Philippines. As a result of the discussion, effective measures will be taken to stop it.</p>
<h3>Reasons for High Rice Prices in Suzhou and Changzhou; Japanese Troops Prohibit the Shipment of Anhui Rice; Suzhou Rice Merchants Stop Transporting</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: In recent days, rice prices in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other counties have soared. In Suzhou, the Japanese have stopped issuing transportation permits and are not allowed to transport rice to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, they detained 250 bags of rice transported to Shanghai by the Sanfeng Rice Store. Now, the rice merchants in Suzhou have obtained permits to transport 3,500 bags. In addition to the 1,315 bags that have already been transported to Shanghai, the remaining 17 carts, totaling 1,875 bags, have stopped being transported to Shanghai. The transportation permits have been returned to the puppet government. Rice merchants in Wuxi have tens of thousands of bags of rice purchased in Wuhu and Dangtu. The Japanese troops in Wuhu suddenly prohibited the shipment, and the payment had already been made. Even with the Changtu transportation permit obtained in exchange for the Wuxi purchase permit, it was still impossible to transport the rice to Wuxi, causing extreme panic in the Suzhou and Changzhou area. The market price suddenly became expensive.</p>
<h3>Grain Panic in Dinghai; Profiteers Hoarding and Speculating; Rice Prices Soar in the City</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: In Dinghai, there are many steep mountains and few plains, so the agricultural output, except for ferns, is very small. The annual rice production is only enough for three months of food for the entire county's population. The poor people in the countryside even use fern silk instead of rice, which is a pitiful sight. Therefore, in previous years, the required grain was often imported from Wenzhou, Haidou, Ningbo, Wuhu, and other places. After Dinghai fell into enemy hands this summer, due to the special circumstances, the routes to Ningbo, Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Taizhou were all forced to suspend. Although fishing boats still operate from time to time, the import of foreign rice is ultimately difficult, so rice prices have soared from 16 yuan to 20 yuan. Although the new grain has been harvested in the fall, transportation between the city and the countryside is blocked. Hong Qiliang, who holds a position in the puppet self-government association, and a few rice merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard and speculate, deliberately raising prices in order to seek personal gain. The puppet association also imposes heavy taxes and levies, resulting in repeated exploitation, causing rice prices to rise to 24 or 25 yuan. The residents of the city are struggling to make a living and are constantly complaining. However, because the countryside is controlled by the Chinese army, rice prices are balanced, and the lives of the villagers are easier to maintain. Therefore, in recent days, city residents, unable to bear the pressure of life, have mostly moved to the countryside to live.</p>
<h3>Puppet Tobacco and Wine Bureau in Wuxi; Fierce Competition for Tax Revenue; A Full-Scale Brawl Erupts</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Jiangsu puppet provincial government, in order to compete for the "tobacco and wine tax," has developed into a double-package case, and disputes have arisen repeatedly without resolution. A fight broke out again the other day over tax revenue. The reason was that a tobacco merchant, Yin Guangtai, transported 24 pieces of tobacco leaves from Anhui Province and reported the donation to the puppet Suzhou Provincial Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau in Daochang Lane. Yuan Fuchang, Qiu Bowei, Wang Zhongfen, Ma Xiaozhou and others, the puppet bureau chiefs, went with the tobacco merchant to the Huangbudun tobacco boat mooring place to check the number of pieces and transport the tobacco leaves to Youshan Chuanbang for storage. There were also puppet police along the way for protection. Then, the Huangbudun Inspection Station of the Changxi District Puppet Stamp Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau caught a glimpse of this, indicating that the tobacco leaves had not been taxed to the puppet bureau, so they detained the tobacco leaves and had a verbal argument with the puppet bureau staff, which led to a fight. Later, the tobacco boat moved closer to Beishuiguan and asked the puppet bureau staff to intercept it at Yingxiang Bridge, and another fight broke out. Both sides were injured. The tobacco boat was still detained by the Changxi District Puppet Bureau. All the participants in the fight who injured Wang Zhongfen, Ma Xiaozhou, Dong Longxing, etc., were sent to the puppet police station, but it was impossible to resolve the matter. It can be seen that the puppet parties in the occupied areas only know how to compete for profit.</p>
<h3>Shantou Youth Arrested; Six or Seven Hundred People Are Missing</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Shantou fell, the Chinese who did not escape in advance were ordered by the Japanese army to guarantee each other in groups of five. At this time, it was impossible to escape. In addition, the villages were counter-blockaded by the Chinese army, so that they suffered from the lack of rice, firewood, oil, salt, and other materials, and were bound by the lack of freedom of speech and action. They have almost exhausted their suffering. However, since November, the Japanese military police department at the Zhaoshang Road Dazhong Hotel in Shantou has been going to the busy streets in the city every day to hunt down young men. Dozens of people are arrested every day. As of now, six or seven hundred people have been arrested. At first, some people wanted to seek bail, but the Japanese army denied that they had caught anyone. However, it was heard that they were transported away in cages at night. One said they were going to Hainan Island or Taiwan for training and were being organized into puppet troops. Another said they were being transported to a certain island to work as miners. Their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>

<p>(Special Telegram from Chongqing) During the Third National Education Conference this year, in addition to resolving to pass the "Proposal to the Ministry of Education to Establish the Current System of Social Education in China," "Establish a National Library System to Broaden Education," "Improve Art Education," "Improve the School System of Art Schools," (Drafting methods, please the Ministry of Education to plan and set up institutions for researching art and music at a high level), "Compile and promote wartime music classics to inspire the people and encourage morale," "Promote phonetic symbols," (Phonetic symbols are a powerful tool for eliminating illiteracy and popularizing Mandarin. Please the Ministry of Education to plan for funding and continue to promote them), "Please plan and set up large-scale science museums, libraries, and antiquities preservation centers in relatively safe areas in the northwest," "Students of wartime people's schools in various provinces should be given continuing education after graduation," "Please promote productive education for refugee children," and other cases, the Ministry of Education submitted a proposal to discuss the improvement of the social education program. It was revised and passed by the conference, and the full text is now being reviewed by the Ministry of Education and sent to the competent departments for execution. The full text of the program has now been located and excerpted below.</p>
<p>The implementation of social education should be based on the highest national construction principles and national policy guidelines, with the aim of improving the people's intelligence, enriching the people's strength, and completing the construction of politics, economy, and culture. In recent years, due to the objective needs of the social environment and the active promotion of the government and the people, social education has made considerable progress. However, the promotion and advancement still depend on future efforts. Therefore, based on the existing foundation and understanding of the needs of the environment, the following improvement methods are formulated:</p>
<p>(A) Phased Increase in People's Schools and Other Social Education Institutions</p>
<p>Zi: In densely populated counties and cities, each "bao" (unit of administrative division) should establish a people's school. In counties with a relatively sparse population and vast area, several "bao" may jointly establish a people's school. Starting from the 28th year (1939), the goal is to complete the establishment within three years, and the existing primary schools should be used as people's schools as much as possible.</p>
<p>Chou: Each county and city should establish a county-level or city-level people's education hall. The provincial education departments should determine the length of the preparation period based on the financial situation of each county and city. Starting from the 28th year (1939), all should be completed within three years. In counties with large populations and abundant funding, they should be increased year by year in rural areas, with the goal of establishing a people's education hall in each autonomous region.</p>
<p>Yin: Each province should divide people's education guidance areas according to the current administrative inspector districts, or geographical and transportation conditions. Each district should establish a provincial-level people's education hall. Starting from the 28th year (1939), the halls should be prepared and completed within three years.</p>
<p>Mao: Provinces and cities that have not established provincial-level or city-level libraries and gymnasiums should immediately begin preparing for the establishment of provincial-level libraries and gymnasiums.</p>
<p>Chen: Provincial-level or city-level museums, science museums, art museums, music theaters, etc., should be prepared and established in stages by each province, depending on its economic situation.</p>
<p>Yi: If each province needs to extend the completion deadline due to special circumstances, it must be submitted to the central management agency for approval.</p>
<p>(B) Continue to Promote Remedial Education for Adult Illiterates, Eliminate Illiteracy Across the Country, Promote National Consciousness, and Enhance the Strength of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The large number of illiterates and the backwardness of the people's intelligence in our country are a hidden worry for the future of national rejuvenation. The Ministry of Education, starting in the autumn of the 25th year (1936), formulated and implemented the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People.</p>
<p>It was submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval, and the deadline for eliminating illiteracy across the country was set at six years. In the past two years, more than 20 million illiterates have been eliminated in various provinces and cities. In April of the 27th year (1938), in order to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and stimulate the national consciousness of the general public, the Ministry of Education specifically implemented wartime people's remedial education in Wuhan, mobilizing intellectuals and using administrative power to carry out large-scale promotion. The content of the education was literacy education and civic education, and the teaching period was shortened to two months. Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Lanzhou and other cities are also conducting it separately, which is quite effective. In the future, it is urgent to actively promote it in various provinces and regions in order to achieve complete success. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Zi: Submit a request to the National Government to issue an order to mobilize intellectuals to carry out remedial education for out-of-school people, and implement a "education service" similar to "military service," forcing intellectuals to take on the work of eliminating illiteracy in order to achieve rapid results. The methods will be stipulated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Chou: The rear provinces should follow the Outline of Measures for Remedial Education for Out-of-School People and the detailed rules for implementation previously issued by the Ministry of Education, and actively promote remedial education for out-of-school people. The teaching period is four months, and the teaching materials are still the four volumes of textbooks for people's schools previously compiled by the Ministry of Education, with the addition of supplementary wartime materials.</p>
<p>Yin: The front provinces and the counties and cities along the main river and highway lines in the rear provinces should popularize wartime people's remedial education within one year, starting from the 28th year (1939).</p>
<p>Mao: People's schools should be attached to primary schools as much as possible, and the teachers should be concurrently served by primary school teachers.</p>
<p>Chen: For specially established people's schools, teachers can be publicly selected by educational administrative organs and given short-term training before taking office.</p>
<p>Yi: In addition to running adult classes and women's classes, wartime people's schools may also run children's classes, and the educational content may include civic training, conscription publicity, and literacy education, as well as production training and wartime service.</p>
<p>Wu: Each province's number of civil officials, number of people's schools established each year, amount of funding, number of teachers, number of students enrolled, and number of students graduated should all be compiled into detailed statistics and reported to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Wei: The organization and promotion methods for implementing wartime people's remedial education can be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines for the Implementation of Wartime People's Remedial Education issued by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Experiments with Card Literacy Education; Center Primary School Established First in Qingmuguan</h3>
<p>(Special Telegram from Bishan) In order to develop primary education in Ba County and Qingmu Township in Bishan County, and to experiment with card literacy education methods, the Ministry of Education has first established a center primary school in Qingmuguan, which officially opened and started teaching at the end of September. Currently, there are 240 students and 22 faculty members in the primary school. Li Lianfang serves as the principal. This teaching method will be applied to all grades below the fourth grade. It is also planned to add or reorganize the primary schools in each "bao" of Qingmu Township. Investigation and planning have now begun, and it will be implemented in the next semester.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates People's Education Halls in Various Provinces; Deadline for Reporting to the Ministry is the End of December</h3>
<p>(Special Telegram from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education is currently striving to improve the work of people's education halls in various provinces. It is reported that an entire program has been formulated and will be announced soon. Now, in order to understand the actual situation of people's education halls in various places, the Ministry has specifically created a survey form on the general situation of people's education halls (divided into sections for hall name, address, organization, funding, and operations, with special emphasis on the description of central work), and has ordered the education departments of various provinces to investigate and report to the Ministry by the end of December of this year.</p>

<h3>Six Provisional Middle Schools to be Established in Zhejiang Province, to Open Next Spring</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondence) The first Zhejiang Provincial Assembly concluded its session a few days ago. Considering the increasing number of students in western Zhejiang who have been deprived of education for years, Zhu Zhonghua and others, in order to provide relief to these out-of-school youths, specially proposed that the Ministry of Education establish sufficient national and provincial provisional middle schools in Zhejiang Province. The proposal has been approved. It is heard that the plan proposed by Zhu and others is to establish six provisional middle schools in the six prefectures of Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, and Yanzhou in eastern Zhejiang, where the national army is stationed, so as to accommodate as many out-of-school youths from western Zhejiang as possible. It is now reported that the assembly will begin operations in the spring of next year.</p>

<h3>Luo Douwen Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; East China's Chen Ronghuan is Completely Renewed; Will Help Chen Fight Dong Se Lai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The famous football player Luo Douwen was formerly a familiar face in the Shanghai football scene. Since going to Hong Kong last year to play for South China, his reputation has increased tenfold.

<h3>The Allied Powers Unanimously Assist China to Strive for Final Victory; British Ambassador Declares No Negotiations Have Taken Place; Japan's Attempts to Release Diplomatic Smoke Screens Have All Failed</h3>
<p>Since the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing on the 15th of last month, there have been various speculations from the outside world, saying that Kerr's visit was to discuss the China issue with the Japanese authorities. However, these are merely speculations. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited authoritative foreign diplomatic circles and observers closely watching the Far East situation in this area, and it has been confirmed that what can fully dispel the doubts is the clear statement made by the British Ambassador. According to Kerr, "I have not recently conducted any important discussions with representatives of third countries in China." The British Ambassador's statement was confirmed by diplomatic circles here yesterday. At the same time, diplomatic circles pointed out that the key to the future relationship between third countries and Japan regarding China is largely tied to Washington.</p>
<p>All Rumors Denied by Britain</p>
<p>It is noted that in the past week, there have been several rumors from the Japanese side, which have caused deep attention and concern in diplomatic circles. One rumor is that Ambassador Kerr has already, or is about to, discuss a wide range of important issues with the Japanese authorities. Foreigners here believe that if such a meeting were to be held, it would be deeply regrettable, because Britain, having its own affairs in Europe, may temporarily abandon its interests in China. However, there is no sign of this to be found. It is reported in Tokyo that Britain is willing to hand over the Chinese silver stored in the British Concession in Tianjin in exchange for Japan lifting the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. However, this rumor has been immediately denied by the British authorities here. Before this incident occurred, Japanese newspapers made a great fuss about the Japanese special envoy Kato's courteous visit to Ambassador Kerr, but it was quickly officially stated by both Britain and Japan that no important issues were discussed.</p>
<p>Japan Releases Diplomatic Smoke Screen</p>
<p>Commentators here pointed out that Japanese newspapers usually exaggerate the development of Japanese diplomacy, but this time, the attention given to the British and Japanese ambassadors is noteworthy, but upon closer inspection, it is not worth laughing at. This is because Japanese newspapers and some pro-Japanese Chinese tabloids reported last week that the British, French, and Japanese envoys would meet in Beiping to discuss the meaning of the United States putting pressure on Japan and the strength and methods to deal with it. Yesterday, reporters listened to the opinions of American and other foreign business circles here, and all believed that what the Japanese side had done in the past two weeks was merely to release a diplomatic smoke screen, because the recent expressions of pressure from the United States, both from the government and the public, against Japan's infringement of the rights and interests of third countries in the occupied areas of China have developed rapidly. Therefore, the Japanese side spread rumors to confuse the public.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Will Not Withdraw, and the War of Resistance Will Continue to the End</p>
<p>Last week, a foreign observer returned to Shanghai from Chongqing and described his feelings, saying that all in Chongqing believe that unless China's position is realized, any "peace" conditions cannot be accepted by China. The observer also said that the great victory in the Xiangbei battle has further consolidated China's political unity and further strengthened Chairman Chiang's statement that "as long as Japanese soldiers are in China for one day, China will resist for one day." Therefore, the British and French policies towards China have not changed unexpectedly after the outbreak of the European war. Moreover, even if they wanted to interfere in China at this time, it would not be possible.</p>
<p>The Allied Powers Unanimously Condemn Japan</p>
<p>Authoritative figures in foreign diplomatic circles here all expressed yesterday that they believe that the Allied countries, in addition to fully supporting China in accordance with their consistent policy, are certain that this attitude is correct and unshakable, as can be proved by the repeated statements made by Washington against Japan and the opinions expressed by the majority of American newspapers and magazines. American public opinion and policy are not only caused by the famous "hundreds of protests" being delayed by Japan, but also because of the general commercial status of third countries in the occupied areas of China. However, diplomatic circles here pointed out that due to the unanimous condemnation of Japan by the Allied Powers, and the encouragement of the United States to put pressure on Japan, forcing Japan to approach the Soviet Union would result in even greater losses for third countries, which is actually an unnecessary "anxiety."</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Is Scheduled to Be Issued on the 8th, Which Will Be Distributed Gradually According to Market Needs; The Auxiliary Currency Notes in Stock Have Also Been Exchanged as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the shortage panic of auxiliary currency notes in the Shanghai market, the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers have agreed on temporary remedies. The banks have exchanged and issued as many new and old auxiliary currency notes as possible. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has also rushed to print one-cent, five-cent, and cent currency notes to replace the use of auxiliary currency notes. It has now been decided to issue them starting from the 8th, adopting a gradual issuance system. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Auxiliary Currency Notes in Stock Are Exchanged as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has already completed the exchange of 3.5 million yuan of new auxiliary currency notes in stock, and has reissued the previously recovered 25-cent notes. The Chinese Farmers Bank has issued as many 50-cent notes in stock as possible, until they are all issued. The Zhejiang Local Bank and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank have sorted out the old auxiliary currency notes that were previously recovered, and reissued the complete notes to facilitate circulation and eliminate the past panic of shortage. Therefore, the panic of shortage of auxiliary currency notes in the Shanghai market is gradually being resolved. In recent days, those who have exchanged currency notes from various banks due to legitimate needs have been very crowded.</p>
<p>The Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Is Scheduled to Be Issued</p>
<p>In order to fundamentally alleviate the shortage of auxiliary currency notes, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank telegraphed the head office to entrust the American merchant Yongning Company to print a large number of one-cent, five-cent, and cent currency notes, with the five-cent notes being the best. The head office has approved this and signed a printing contract with Yongning Company. The printed fractional currency notes will be delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank at any time. The bank has recently decided to start issuing them on the 8th of this month (Friday), adopting a gradual issuance system according to market needs, and using five-cent notes to replace the use of auxiliary currency notes. It is heard that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is ready for the issuance of fractional currency notes.</p>
<p>Exchange Methods Have Been Stipulated</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance methods of fractional currency notes, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that if member banks of the Shanghai financial industry banking association and the Huichang Money Shop of the Money Shop Association, as well as major companies and major stores, have a legitimate need for fractional currency notes due to business, they can exchange them at the Central Bank. The bank will review and, if it deems them qualified, provide them as much as possible. It is also stipulated that those who receive fractional currency notes must not hoard them for profit. It has been decided to temporarily stop supplying small money shops and cigarette exchange shops this time, because it has been reported that some small money shops and cigarette exchange shops deliberately hoarded them for speculation.</p>
<p>Be Careful Not to Hoard, Which Will Affect People's Livelihood</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency also learned from banking circles that the number of auxiliary currency notes issued by various banks in Shanghai circulating in the market is quite large. In terms of nickel-copper auxiliary currency, there are a total of 27,466,180.8 yuan. On today's Shanghai market, they are almost completely absent. Therefore, the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers do not know the reason for today's sudden shortage. Therefore, it is obvious that someone is taking advantage of the environment to manipulate and profit. The four banks have now agreed on fundamental remedies, so the severity of the shortage panic can be completely eliminated. However, it is hoped that all sectors will be careful not to hoard for profit in the future, so as not to affect the livelihood of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Continues to Assist China</p>
<p>Observers believe that the Soviet Union is unwilling to assist Japan in its "holy war" in China unless Japan can pay a staggering price. Moreover, even if Japan recognizes the Soviet Union's huge demands, the Soviet Union's assistance and encouragement to the Chinese National Government will continue unabated. At this time, Japan is fluctuating between accepting American demands and begging for Soviet support, and its army is distributed across a historically unprecedented vast front. The domestic economy is also in a dire situation due to the actions of the navy and army. Therefore, based on these arguments, a leader-observer from a third country concluded to the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday that Japan's current situation is indeed in the worst possible state. Therefore, neither Britain nor France is willing to cooperate with Japan at this time. As for the efforts made by the United States today, it is undoubtedly in a proactive position.</p>
<h3>Provinces, Cities, and Counties Enthusiastically Promote National Construction Savings; Post Office Completes the Procedures for Issuing Coupons</h3>
<p>In order to encourage national savings and build national construction undertakings, the National Government has designated various banks to conduct national construction savings and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to issue thrift national construction savings coupons. Provinces, cities, and counties across the country have unanimously promoted this. The central government, considering that this is a major plan for national construction, has established a National Thrift National Construction Savings Movement Committee to coordinate and promote the effort. Currently, important cities in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces have decided to establish branches. More than 1,000 post offices across the country have also completed the procedures for issuing national construction savings coupons by the end of last month. Party and government organs in various places have unanimously coordinated publicity. Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, the people have enthusiastically participated in thrift savings to assist the country's national construction undertakings.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Are Expected to Break Free from Japanese Shackles; Tribute Rice Arrived Again Yesterday, Price Per Bag is Approximately 30 Yuan; Foreign Newspapers Observe the Soaring Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai rice situation will tend to stabilize, with national rice and tribute rice pouring into the port. More than 20,000 bags of tribute rice transported from Hong Kong arrived yesterday and entered the warehouse yesterday morning to wait for customers. The total cost is relatively low, with each bag weighing 189 pounds, only about 30 yuan in national currency. It is heard that rice industry firms in this city are in contact for the third purchase and will transport it to Shanghai for storage, so that profiteers will run out of tricks and be exhausted, and can break free from Japanese shackles. After the Shanghai Market Management Committee strictly monitors the buying and selling of rice market tea parties by the same industry and enforces market rules to maintain order, the price of japonica and indica rice has begun to fall since the day before yesterday. The 5 million citizens of Shanghai are paying close attention to the trend of the nearby rice market. In addition to hoping that the authorities will thoroughly investigate the rumor-mongering rice weevils and strictly implement price limits, they also hope that the person in charge of the rice market will step up efforts to stabilize people's hearts so that market prices will fall step by step.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspapers' Views Blame the Japanese</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post sees high prices. Chinese newspapers now strongly condemn the manipulators in the market here. However, according to a closer investigation, it does not seem to be blamed on the manipulators, because this situation is caused by the Japanese. A certain morning newspaper uses the phrase "official non-interference," indicating that the Municipal Council has no action in this situation. However, according to investigations, what the Municipal Council can do is very little. Chinese newspapers convey the methods adopted by Chinese business groups, such as "requesting rice market buyers, sellers, and brokers to consider the lives of the poor and warning them not to be selfish and disrupt peace and order," etc., which have no impact on the rice market. The soaring rice prices in Shanghai are by no means due to hoarding by Chinese merchants, but can be completely attributed to the Japanese. This is the conclusion reached by reporters investigating the rice situation.</p>
<p>Although the Exchange Rate is Low, Tribute Rice is Still Cheap</p>
<p>A reporter heard a gentleman say that the current situation is extremely embarrassing. Although the exchange rate is low, Saigon rice is still slightly cheaper than national rice. What else can be said? Although this year's rice production in the Yangtze River Basin is not as much as it would be in a normal political situation, it is still considered a bumper harvest. After the new rice hits the market in September, there will be enough rice to supply Shanghai for six to eight months, until it is exhausted in April, May, and June next year. However, this rice has not been transported to the Shanghai market. There are several reasons for this, which can be summarized as being due to the Japanese army in China.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Lack of Japanese Rice Production</p>
<p>This year, Japanese rice production is 14% lower, for the reasons of (1) abnormal weather, (2) many farmers who should be engaged in farming have joined the army, (3) farm women are now working in munitions factories. In the past, when Japan had a poor harvest, it was always 12% lower than usual. This year, it is doubled. In the past, when Japan had a poor harvest, it relied on Korea. However, Korea also had a poor harvest this year, and cannot be expected to provide assistance. As a result, Japan has only one thing to do, which is to print a large number of paper money, calling it "Yen," "Huaxing Piao," or any other name, which is carried by the Japanese army to the vast rice-producing areas between Taihu Lake and Poyang Lake, in order to solve Japan's rice shortage. The Japanese soldiers holding guns and bayonets and holding paper "currency" implement this treacherous plan. Those who need rice are not only Japan itself, but also the million Japanese soldiers on the Chinese battlefield need it, and the followers of the Japanese army also take from it. Therefore, what the Japanese army eats is not only the rice of a million people.</p>
<p>Extortion of Taxes and Difficult Transportation</p>
<p>The remaining rice is transported to the Shanghai Concession and other places after all kinds of difficulties and the "taxes" of the Japanese puppets. The price of rice in the interior is currently 18 to 20 yuan per stone. After being squeezed along the way, it rises to 35 yuan when it arrives in Shanghai. The reduction in weight during transportation, plus the small profits sought by the sellers, brings the rice price to around 40 yuan. Although the exchange rate is low for rice imported from Saigon, and transportation costs are added, it is still slightly lower than the figure of 40 yuan. The average Chinese person eats two pounds of rice per day. A family of three consumes six pounds of rice per day, which costs 40 yuan per month. However, the average Chinese income is only about 35 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>New Dispute at the Lun Chang Old Factory is Trending Towards Resolution; Workers Are Unwilling to Be Exploited Again; Full Resumption of Work Expected Within Days</h3>
<p>After the resolution of the labor unrest at the British Lun Chang Textile Factory new factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, workers have successively resumed work, and there is no problem. However, workers at the Lun Chang Old Factory in Bailianjing raised a new wave of dispute because they pointed out that the terms of this resolution were not as favorable as when labor and management directly negotiated at the beginning. They also blocked workers living in Puxi from going to work. According to investigations, most workers do not want to be exploited again after a long period of work stoppage and living in hardship. Therefore, on the day of resumption of work, some of those who were prevented from going to work are continuing to enter the factory. Although they do not account for the vast majority, it is believed that within a few days, they will all resume work. Therefore, the new dispute will be resolved invisibly.</p>
<h3>Eggs from Inland China Are Still Controlled by the Japanese</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 30th that "for some time, the Japanese merchant Mitsui Company has been detaining the eggs purchased by various foreign merchants when they are transported to Shanghai, which has caused protests from all sides. Afterwards, the eggs were returned to their original owners. Now, the Japanese authorities have stated that in principle, the egg market has been restored to freedom, but there should be some 'procedures'." However, the so-called "procedures" almost prevent foreign merchants from exporting eggs from the market. In fact, before foreign merchants purchase eggs in the inland, they must pay a fee of two yen per basket to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce to obtain a license. In fact, this chamber of commerce is indeed an alias for Mitsui Company. When obtaining the license, foreign merchants must sell 50% of their eggs to Mitsui Company, and the price is determined by Mitsui itself. However, this price is always lower than the price of inland eggs.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Prepare for Annual Closing; Office As Usual on December 30; Money Shops Also Close Accounts at the End of the Lunar Year</h3>
<p>The end of the fiscal year of the Republic of China in 1928 is approaching, and member banks and money shops of the Bank and Money Shop Association have begun to prepare. However, the closing date of December 31st happens to be a Sunday holiday. The banks and money shops have decided internally to work as usual on that day and will announce the implementation after the two associations have passed it. They have also set a three-day holiday from New Year's Day next year and will open for business on the 4th. As for the closing of accounts for money shops, it is usually at the end of the lunar year (i.e., February 7th). However, this year, in addition to closing accounts at the end of the lunar year, they will also close annual accounts at the end of the national calendar. The reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday from the banks and money shops that the financial market in Shanghai is stable and unchanged due to the lending of the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers and the adjustment of the treasury by the banks and money shops. There is no sign of tight money, so there is no problem in all industries safely passing the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Employees Receive Allowances</h3>
<p>Customs employees had previously requested the authorities to increase allowances due to the increased cost of living in Shanghai. It is now learned that this request has been approved by the authorities. The method is that starting from October, (1) each person will receive an additional allowance of 15 yuan per month, (2) the allowances for October, November, December, and three months will be issued together at the end of December, and starting from January next year, they will be issued monthly.</p>
<h3>Chongde Post Office in Zhejiang Resumes Operations; Shanghai Post Office Notifies Postal Shipments</h3>
<p>The Chongde Post Office in Zhejiang was evacuated after the war, and postal transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang was somewhat stagnant. Through the efforts of the Shanghai Post Office authorities and the Zhejiang Administration, they have been restored one after another. It is learned that the Chongde Post Office has now resumed operations. The Shanghai Post Office has resumed accepting all types of mail to the Chongde Post Office and will hand them over to the Chang'an Post Office in Zhejiang for delivery.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Defenses in Western Shanghai by British Troops: Repairing Wire Mesh Fences on Route Doumer</h3>
<p>In the areas beyond the Shanghai International Settlement roads in western Shanghai, bordering the Chinese-administered territories, during the Shanghai war, the Settlement authorities erected wooden posts along the roads, surrounded them with wire mesh fences to block traffic, and constructed defensive works at several key locations to maintain security within the Settlement. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese puppet troops and police invaded the area beyond the Settlement roads, they gradually damaged or dismantled the installed wire mesh fences in various places without the consent of the Settlement authorities. Consequently, criminals were able to emerge and cause disturbances to the peace. As the Settlement began to implement winter defenses, the British garrison troops in the area have been carrying large quantities of wire mesh fences and wooden posts for days, actively repairing wire mesh fences on Route Doumer, parallel to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, from Route Andre Cohen to Route Koukouchow. The work is expected to be completed soon to strengthen defenses.</p>

<h3>Japanese Newspapers: Reporting Severely Restricted, Shrouded in the Darkness of Censorship, News Reports Deliberately Distorting Facts</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Gault, who recently returned to Shanghai from Japan, wrote an article published in this week's China Critic, stating that although much of the news published in Shanghai is propaganda, it is reported very clearly. However, Japanese newspapers are shrouded in the darkness of censorship. Japanese newspapers deliberately distort facts in their reports on current events, regardless of whether they are related to the war situation in China or the trends of Japanese interests in remote corners of the world. Recent events such as the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty and the Soviet-German Treaty show that the development of international news is completely unexpected by the Japanese people. Currently, Japanese newspapers are used as a tool to comfort the people rather than to educate them. Therefore, the setbacks suffered by Japanese foreign policy have not caused excessive anxiety among the public.</p>
<h3>Shortening Shanghai-Ningbo Voyage Time: Still No Definite News, Rumors of Implementation Today are Speculative</h3>
<p>Although the change of mooring outside the mouth of the Zhenhai port after it was blocked has caused a lot of inconvenience for the loading and unloading of goods and passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo route ships, business is still thriving. However, due to waiting for loading and unloading at the mouth of Zhenhai port, shipping schedules have been delayed, causing huge losses to shipping companies. They have repeatedly tried to shorten the voyage time, but have been unable to do so due to various reasons. Recently, it has been repeatedly reported that the Moufu, Deping, Haifu, and Hana ships were designated for annual repairs in dock. After the repairs of Shililai were completed, it test sailed to Wenzhou the day before yesterday. Moufu and Feikang are still in Zhenhai waiting to load and unload goods. The Hana ship went to Ningbo on the 24th. After passengers disembarked, it sailed to Songmen to unload goods. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from the ship, saying that it could return to Shanghai from Songmen tonight, and it is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. The next shift will continue to sail to Zhenhai, combining Wan and Song, but the designation of Tian ships to carry passengers and shorten shipping schedules are all hypothetical.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Attacking Jinshanwei: Zhapu Recaptured, Large Army Gathered, Rumors of Fierce Battle in Hangzhou Bay</h3>
<p>It is rumored that a unit of a certain independent brigade of the Chinese regular army has occupied the strongholds on the Shanghai-Hangzhou road. Therefore, traffic on the highway from Shanghai to Jinshan and other coastal areas has been cut off. This regular army, with distinct uniforms, and the reorganized 8th Detachment of the Zhongyi Salvation Army of guerrillas, have made contact with the invading Japanese army. Two Japanese army speedboats were destroyed, and more than 30 people were killed. Many puppet troops along the line have defected. After Jinshanwei was occupied by the Japanese army, it opened up an airport and wharf, which is equivalent to a military port and an air force base. Recently, since Zhapu was recaptured, a large army has gathered in Hangzhou Bay, and Jinshanwei is in imminent danger. The Chinese army will make every effort to capture it and destroy it to prevent its use.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Residents Going to Ningbo Can Return to Shanghai with Certification</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, regarding whether Shanghai residents can still obtain export permits from the Yin County government with the Association's certificate after going to Ningbo, has now received a reply telegram from Zhou Dalie, Chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, stating, "To the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association: The telegram is acknowledged. For those exporting labor, if their place of residence is indeed in Shanghai, and certified by your Association, they can obtain export permits from the County government, and must provide shop guarantee: (1) Guarantee that the place of residence is authentic; (2) Guarantee that the recruits will return to their hometown for military service when slightly adjusted. This is the reply. Zhou Dalie."</p>
<h3>Scots Celebrate National Day: Offering Flowers at the Peace Statue, Communion Service Held in Church</h3>

The golf tournament between the St. Andrew's Society and the Royal Society of St. George is scheduled for Sunday, but the grand dance party held on that day in previous years has been cancelled this year due to the European War.</p>

<h3>Moral Re-Armament Broadcast: A Ray of Hope in the World Crisis</h3>
<p>— A Lecture by Dr. Buchman</p>
<p>At 7:30 last night, the Moral Re-Armament movement in this city broadcast on the Gospel Radio Station, featuring a speech by Dr. Frank Buchman, the founder of the Moral Re-Armament movement, entitled "A Ray of Hope in the World Crisis," read by Dr. Ferguson of Renji Hospital. This speech was first broadcast in Boston and San Francisco in the United States, and then the Dutch radio station also broadcast this speech to Java. The United Kingdom can also listen to it at the same time, and the New York radio station also broadcast it a month ago. The broadcasting time was originally set for 45 minutes, but it was extended by 8 minutes due to insufficient time, breaking the record of the New York radio station, which shows the importance of this speech. Now, the main points of its content are recorded below:</p>
<p>Focus on Character</p>
<p>"In today's world, the flames of war are growing, and human culture is on the verge of bankruptcy. At this critical time, we urgently need a new philosophy to rebuild the world and restore the principles of purity, unselfishness, love, and four kinds of loyalty. This is the standard of the Moral Re-Armament movement.</p>
<p>Current Crisis</p>
<p>The current crisis is frequent, and our thoughts and actions have gone bankrupt. The weakness of human wisdom and ability makes us have to turn to the way of God's management, eliminate prejudice, regardless of nation or party, and jointly under God's management, enrich moral strength, and build a new society and a new world, seeking the permanent happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>Obey God</p>
<p>However, moral re-armament must start from the individual's obedience to the voice of God, discipline oneself and forgive others, make life tend to the four standards, accept God's management, practice it personally, and strive to complete our highest mission." It is reported that from today to the 3rd, it is the day for promoting the Moral Re-Armament movement in this city. During these three days, from 12:45 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. on the East Radio Station (XHHG 1220), and from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on the Gospel Radio Station (XMMHD 760), special broadcast lectures will be given in six major units: youth, education, career, medicine, family, and church. The people in the movement are very willing for people from all walks of life to listen to this broadcast on time.</p>

President Chen is not employing private individuals, so this time he only brought one servant with him.</p>
<h3>Case of Embezzling Huge Sums of US Dollars: Waiting for a Telegram from Tianjin for Verification, Xu Xinmin Redeemed Prostitute Rong Ruizhen: Both Fled to Shanghai and Were Intercepted at the Pier: Stole a Total of 43,000 US Dollars</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police received a telegram from the Police Department of the Tianjin French Concession the day before yesterday, stating that a clerk from a commercial bank in the Tianjin French Concession embezzled a huge sum of US dollars and took the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship to Shanghai, requesting them to send personnel to intercept him. The French Police sent detectives to wait at the pier and caught a male and a female suspect, and seized the stolen money. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Xu Xinmin, also known as Yi Qin, from Yantai, is the deputy director of the business department of the Banque de l'Indochine in the Tianjin French Concession. He is 30 years old this year. Usually, he is generous and active in social circles. He met Rong Ruizhen, a prostitute at the Six Nations Hotel on the third floor of Tianjin, and set a price of more than 3,000 taels of gold. However, Xu did not have this huge sum of money at the time, and he was unwilling to break his promise to Rong. Thus, he came up with a plan to steal and embezzle funds and flee. He managed to open the bank's safe and steal 43,000 US dollars (equivalent to more than 500,000 Chinese legal tender). He went to the Six Nations Hotel to complete the redemption procedures for the prostitute Rong, and then took her to Shanghai. After the bank discovered the incident, they investigated the stolen money and reported it to the Tianjin French Police Department, requesting an investigation. After finding out that Xu had taken the prostitute Rong and boarded the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship to Shanghai, they urgently sent a telegram to notify Shanghai. After receiving the report, the French Police sent Detective Wang Ronggui and Inspector Xie Guangming, along with detectives, to wait at Taikoo Pier No. 3 at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday. At about 3 p.m., the Hubei ship entered the pier and was about to dock. The detectives hired sampans to board the ship and search. As a result, Xu and the prostitute Rong were arrested in the official cabin room, and more than 39,000 US dollars were found in their luggage suitcases. As for the rest of the money, Xu said that it had been spent on the prostitute Rong's redemption and travel expenses. The detectives then took Xu, the prostitute Rong, and their luggage back to the police station, waiting for a telegram from the Tianjin French Police Department for verification and further processing. It is also heard that the prostitute Rong's mother also took the money to redeem her daughter by taking the train to Shanghai, so the police also sent detectives to wait at the pier to arrest her.</p>
<h3>Employee of the Banque de l'Union Française Being Sued for Embezzlement Due to Gambling Debts</h3>
<p>Zhuang Ziyu, a 35-year-old Guangdong native and bill collector at the Banque de l'Union Française at 9 Avenue Edward VII, residing at 190 Ju'an Lane, Rue Chu Pao, was ordered by the manager on the morning of the 27th of this month to collect debts from 765 and 913 Avenue Joffre, etc. Zhuang collected 1,230 yuan and immediately took it to a gambling den in western Shanghai. He lost all the money gambling and had to return dejectedly. The information was reported to the manager, who believed that Zhuang had used the company's money for gambling and had committed the crime of embezzlement. He immediately reported to the police and had Zhuang arrested. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court and tried by Judge Miao. According to the defendant Zhuang Ziyu's statement, his wife was about to give birth, but he had no money, so he planned to win money at the casino to pay for the childbirth expenses. He did not expect to lose all the money, and it was too late for regret. The court reviewed the statement and ordered a postponement of the investigation.</p>
<h3>Heavy Parcel Deliveries to Southwestern Regions Temporarily Suspended, Parcel Deliveries to Shandong Area Resume</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army landed in Beihai, postal transportation was obstructed. The Shanghai Post Office changed the routes of mail and parcels. Afterwards, heavy parcels to Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, or parcels from the Dongming Bureau under the Beiping area...</p>
<h3>Yongzhen Ship Sailed to Wenzhou, Japanese Warship Prevented Entry</h3>
<p>Among the foreign merchant ships that test-sailed the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, in addition to the Norwegian ship Huasheng and the American ship Daxin, which had successfully test-sailed and arrived in Wenzhou, the British ship Yongzhen, represented by the Fusheng Shipping Company in this port, sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 23rd of this month. There was no telegram about the situation on the way. According to a New Life News Agency reporter, the ship sent a telegram from outside the Oujiang Estuary yesterday, saying, "Due to the Japanese warship preventing entry, it is still anchored outside the estuary." The company believes that the ship has been away from Shanghai for many days, and all fuel and food are not adequately prepared. It has been ordered to return to Shanghai immediately.</p>
<h3>Quru Money Shop Robbery Case: Culprits Apprehended and Trial Completed, Another Three Robbery Cases Committed</h3>
<p>The Quru Money Shop at 84 Seward Road, Hongkou, was invaded on the night of the 12th of last month at 8 p.m. by Yu Hegen, the shop owner Wang Bingyang's driver, who colluded with local gang robbers Dai Gengsheng, Sun Hongsheng, Zhang Pinru, Wang Ziqing, Wu Pengcheng, Shen Boling, Chen Baijin, Huang Yuanxiang, Qin Qilang, Chen Youqi, and fugitive gang leaders Chen Xilang and Wang Heshang, using weapons. They first tied the employees with hemp ropes in a dark room, then went upstairs to dig open the silver boxes and iron vaults, robbing about 135,246.90 yuan in legal tender, Japanese currency, and US dollars before fleeing. The next day, Huateman Shang Wu of the Customs Police learned about the gang's sharing of the loot. He led Hua detectives Ma Bingzhang, Wang Youshan, etc., to 207 North Jiangxi Road and the Jielu Railway Hotel, etc., and arrested the above-mentioned defendants, seizing stolen money and jewelry purchased with the stolen money, totaling about 47,500 yuan. He also arrested three receivers of stolen goods, Shi Qizhen, Lu Wanzhen, and Xu Wuda, and sent them to the First Special Court. After interrogation, the court ordered a postponement of the investigation. Yesterday at 2 p.m., Judge Jiang opened a special court to hear the case. In addition to prosecuting the defendants for gang robbery, the police also prosecuted three more robbery cases: (1) On September 22, they robbed Xie Qingsheng's home at 4 Lane 751, Route Conty, of 600 yuan; (2) On October 1, they robbed Dr. Yuan Jingkang's jewelry shop at 7 Lane 30, Zhifu Road, of more than 300 yuan; (3) On October 10, they robbed Wang Xingwu's home at 17 Lane 524, Avenue Haig, of 1,030 yuan. After Judge Jiang took his seat, he interrogated each defendant strictly. The defendants all admitted the charges. Wang Bingyang, the owner of the Quru Money Shop, commissioned lawyer Lang Peng to file a petition requesting that, in addition to the seized stolen money and jewelry being returned, the defendants be ordered to jointly compensate for the losses of 88,339.98 yuan. Defendant Yu Hegen stated, "I was invited by Wang Heshang to rob my master. Not only did I not benefit, but I lost 150 yuan of my own money. Now, most of the 30,000 yuan I received has been seized. I have no ability to compensate." The court reviewed the statement and ordered the conclusion of the debate. The defendants were returned to custody and the verdict was scheduled for Thursday morning next week. The seized stolen money will be returned to the Quru Money Shop first, and the hemp ropes and iron bars used in the crime will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Failure to Deliver Built Houses, Refund of Deposits, Request for Execution Due to Delayed Payments</h3>
<p>Wang Liwu and Zhang Zhongxiu jointly founded the Zhenxing Company and collected deposits from customers under the pretense of building houses. As a result, no houses could be delivered. There have been several cases of customers filing lawsuits to recover their money. Now, Sha Yunwu and Zhang Zuoyi, from Jiangyin, have also filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court for the same reason. Because Wang, etc., repeatedly requested reconciliation, a reconciliation was finally reached in court, agreeing to repay in installments. Wang not only delayed the repayments but also... In order to settle the matter, they agreed to first collect the two installments that were due, and there are still three... A judgment was made and a fine was imposed. On the one hand, they filed a petition to continue the execution. The court had previously sealed up Wang's office on the sixth floor of the Continental Commercial Building and, after evaluation, auctioned it off on the morning of the 27th, receiving more than 200 yuan. However, the debts still amount to more than 2,000 yuan. It is heard that the creditors are preparing to apply to the court to continue the execution.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Owner Fined</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has skyrocketed, and the common people are already groaning in pain, finding it difficult to maintain a basic level of sustenance. Unexpectedly, the Guanghua Rice Shop at 39 Taiping Bridge Street, opposite the small vegetable market, French Concession, was so cruel that it lined the bottom of the rice measuring cups with horse manure cardboard about half an inch thick, in order to exploit the common people and make a profit. A few days ago, Ms. Zhu Guo, from 8 Wenxian Lane, Route Lafayette, went to buy rice and discovered the secret. She reported it to the police, who arrested the rice shop owner Yin Shangbin and the padded measuring cups, and sent them to the Second Special Court to be prosecuted according to the law. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has now been concluded after interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Qiu sentenced Yin Shangbin to a fine of 300 yuan. If he is unable to pay, he will perform labor service, with 2 yuan being deducted for each day.</p>
<h3>Factory Manager Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Xu Shuliang, owner of the Shanghai Hosiery Factory at 17 Yu Gu Cun, Yu Garden Road, Ningbo native, recently filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Jin Ji'an, the factory manager, Shaoxing native (currently residing at 40 Bo Xiang Cun, Route Pére Robert), of breach of trust and embezzlement. According to the statement, in June of this year, the plaintiff raised funds to open the Shanghai Hosiery Factory. Because he was not familiar with the hosiery business, the defendant was appointed as the factory manager. Unexpectedly, the defendant successively took the factory's wool material for private use and embezzled the proceeds, and privately collected 1,377 yuan in customer accounts, and disappeared. The plaintiff commissioned a lawyer to publish a warning in the newspaper, but it was ignored. Therefore, he requested a summons for strict investigation and a civil lawsuit for compensation for the embezzled funds. Upon receiving the statement, Judge Zhang summoned the defendant to court yesterday, but the defendant did not appear. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing and summoned the defendant to court for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Contract Violation and Embezzlement Case: Cao Wenyu's Appeal Rejected, Still Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>In a lawsuit using audio recording as evidence, Cao Wenyu, an employee of a Japanese company, revealed the truth of the crime in a phone call. As a result of being secretly recorded by his cousin Cai Xiaoti, Cao lost both trials. This is a new invention using scientific evidence. The details of the case are as follows: Cao Wenyu, a Pudong native and employee of the Japanese-owned Huili Company, is 30 years old this year. In the spring of last year, he acted on the instructions of his employer and sold 20,000 bags of wheat from the Huili Company in his own name. At that time, Cao signed a contract with the buyer Cai Xiaoti (who is Cao's cousin). Unexpectedly, after Cai paid the deposit, Cao violated the contract and failed to deliver the goods, causing Cai to suffer considerable losses. In May of this year, Cai hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Cao of violating the contract and requesting a judgment for compensation for the losses and return of the deposit, totaling more than 12,000 yuan. When the court summoned Cao, Cao suddenly presented a fabricated settlement agreement, claiming that the previously signed wheat sales contract had been canceled. Cai argued that the fabricated settlement agreement had not been signed by him, had no witnesses, and the seal was stolen. However, he could not prove that the seal was stolen. Cai then commissioned an audio recording company to make an audio recording. When Cai spoke with Cao on the phone, Cao admitted to stealing a seal and said that he had no choice. The conversation between the two parties was made into a record by the audio recording company. Afterwards, Cai hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Cao of forgery. After reviewing the case, Judge Sun Pengxian sentenced Cao to six months in prison. Cao was not satisfied with the judgment and hired lawyer Huang Zengjie to appeal to the High Court Third Branch. After reviewing the case, the High Court opened a hearing and played the record in court. The presiding judge and the judges believed that Cao's true nature of the crime was revealed in the record. Therefore, they announced the conclusion of the hearing. Yesterday, Chen Daqi, acting presiding judge, took his seat in the Second Criminal Division and announced the verdict, rejecting the appeal. Cao Wenyu was still sentenced to six months in prison.</p>
<h3>Case of Plotting to Kill Father An: Jurisdictional Issues, Awaiting a Ruling from Higher Authorities for Further Review</h3>
<p>Father An, director of the Tushanwan Orphanage Arts Institute in Xujiahui, was killed by robbers for money on August 30. After the incident, Ju Bolu, an accomplice, voluntarily surrendered and was detained by the French Police. Based on Ju's confession, four more accomplices were arrested: Shen Xingtang, Xu Gendi, Wang Guirong, and Jiang Yongqing. Another key suspect, Zhou Yuelou, is still at large in Pudong as a guerrilla and is not easy to arrest. The Customs Police requested the court to issue an arrest warrant. At the same time, the Customs Police sent the five suspects, including Ju, to the Second Special Court for prosecution for murder. After Judge Liao Yan repeatedly opened court for trial, the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court opened again to continue the trial. The defendants' appointed defense lawyer Wang Hengyi and selected defense lawyer Yu Zhaolin also appeared in court to wait for instructions. After the court questioned the defendants, it was determined that there were jurisdictional issues regarding the location of the incident, Xujiahui, and a request must be submitted to a higher authority for designation. Therefore, the court ordered that the case be adjourned to await review. The defendants were all returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Selling a Young Girl: Wei Feigen Punished</h3>
<p>Wei Feigen (26 years old), a Pudong native who works as an employee at the Seventh Refugee Shelter on Pong Road, had a 20-year-old village girl Song Yunnan from Yinxiang Port visit her aunt at the shelter in March of last year. Wei lured her to a hotel room and had sexual intercourse with her. Later, because Wei was losing money gambling, he sold Song to Wang A'gen, a local man who works at the Hongyunlou restaurant at 10 Kaifeng Road, Alabaster Road, for 40 yuan to be his wife. Song's father, Song Xiansheng, learned of this incident when he came to Shanghai. The case was reported and Customs Police Detective Yang Xichen arrested and sent him to the First Special Court.

<h3>Finance - Hong Kong Telegraph Rises, Absorbing Large Quantities - Gold Price Rises Fiercely in the Afternoon - Informal Trading Reaches 3940 Yuan - Active Trading of 2500 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's informal trading of spot gold saw normal fluctuations in the morning session. As there were few reports of changes in foreign exchange rates, although a certain money exchange house from Hong Kong entrusted someone to buy in, a certain gold firm released short positions on behalf of speculative traders. Furthermore, silver shops and retail investors were also selling, resulting in a near balance of positions. Afterwards, although foreign exchange rates were extremely tight, the gold price rose sharply, breaking through the 3900 yuan barrier. This was due to reports of rising gold prices in Hong Kong, prompting Hong Kong firms to purchase large quantities without limit, and settling at a foreign exchange rate that was approximately 600 yuan lower. This attracted many retail investors and financial institutions to buy in, leading to a further increase in the closing price. The situation on that day saw unremarkable fluctuations in the morning, only around 11 yuan, ultimately hovering around 3870 yuan until the afternoon closing. The price was initially firm in the afternoon, but after 2:30 PM, the exchange rate softened, and Hong Kong firms continued to purchase. Although there was a slight dip in the middle, it was difficult to stop the final upward trend, rising to 3925 yuan. The closing price reached the highest point of the day, a significant increase of 59 yuan compared to the previous day. Buying momentum did not decrease after the close, with gold firms absorbing the most, at a price around 3940 yuan. Trading was active throughout the day, totaling 2500 taels. The price of silver shop ornaments was initially stable, but also rose sharply by 10 yuan in the afternoon. Customs gold and other items remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Up 59 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with a slight softening of exchange rates, resulting in a good situation. The opening price rose by 4 yuan, with a money exchange house buying 20 taels from a gold firm at 3870 yuan. Soon after, securities firms also came to bid, raising the price by another 4 yuan in an instant. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver shops, and money exchange houses did 10 taels among themselves, all at 3874 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market remained stable, sentiment slightly weakened, and silver shops and retail gold firms sold to each other. The price soon fell back by 7 yuan, with a silver shop selling 30 taels to a money exchange house at 3867 yuan. Afterwards, as Hong Kong firms initiated purchases, entrusting a certain money exchange house to buy on their behalf, the price was pulled up by 10 yuan. The money exchange house and a spot gold firm jointly bought 30 taels from silver shops and money exchange houses at 3877 yuan. After that, buying stopped. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was slightly firmer, and short sellers from securities firms came to sell, causing a small rebound of 11 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop at 3866 yuan. By noon, a certain money exchange house suddenly came to buy in again, and the price rose by 6 yuan. A certain money exchange house bought 30 taels from silver shops at 3872 yuan. Then, money exchange houses did 20 taels among themselves at 3870 yuan, setting the noon closing price. The afternoon started quietly, but the underlying trend was slightly firm. The opening price rose by 5 yuan, with a money exchange house buying 10 taels from a spot gold firm at 3875 yuan. By 2:30 PM, the foreign exchange rate was slightly softer, and a certain money exchange house bought over 300 taels on behalf of Hong Kong firms, and at the same time, a certain gold firm also came to compete to buy, immediately raising the price by 35 yuan. Other firms bought 20 taels from securities firms at 12,910 yuan. After that, the buying momentum subsided slightly, and those with floating profits sold, briefly falling back inside the 3900 yuan barrier, to 3886 yuan. At that time, news of rising gold prices in Hong Kong was heard, and buying momentum was revived. A certain money exchange house and a certain gold firm came to compete to absorb the gold again, and securities firms also came to cover their short positions, raising the price by another 39 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from silver shops at 3925 yuan. After that, money exchange houses took profits, falling back by 7 yuan. A money exchange house sold 10 taels to a gold firm at 3918 yuan. Later, securities firms and gold firms bought in again, raising the price by another 7 yuan. A gold firm bought 30 taels from a money exchange house at 3925 yuan, setting the evening closing price. As a result, the price increased by 59 yuan compared to the previous day.

Finally, there were a few transactions at 3935 yuan. The overall fluctuation for the day was 59 yuan. The spot gold price of spot gold firms was 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the absorption of spot gold firms decreased by more than 20 yuan.

<p>Ornament Gold Highly Priced at 400 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver shop ornament gold per tael was still suspended at 390 yuan in most shops. Then, at 2:25 PM, it was raised by 5 yuan. At 4:15 PM in the evening, it was raised by another 5 yuan. As a result, the most shops changed the suspended price to 400 yuan. The prices of new shops were the same as the prices of the most shops. The absorption of ornament gold decreased by 15 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>

The interest rate for interbank lending by the Money Exchange Association remained at 0.15 yuan for both morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Firms Sell Large Amounts of US Dollars</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed prices. The informal market for British and American exchange was increasingly ordinary. Most operators were busy with settlements, and there were very few people discussing new transactions. The process on that day saw a slightly soft opening. Although overseas reports indicated a significant reduction of 0.125 in the British and American exchange rates, the market in this city had already decreased by more than 0.02 on the previous day, so it was not affected. After the opening, Hong Kong telegraph first released US$200,000 in American exchange, and money exchange houses also sold American dollar bills. At the same time, a small number of Chinese merchants also released some, so the market immediately returned to stability. There were no changes by the noon closing, which was equivalent to the previous day's market price. In the afternoon, the situation remained the same, lacking highlights. However, as Chinese banks slightly absorbed forward contracts, the market remained slightly tight until the evening closing, with a price of 4/8.125 and 7.8125, which was 0.015625 tighter than the previous day in British gold, and 0.03125 tighter in American exchange. The difference between futures and spot prices was gradually narrowing, with British gold differing by 0.046875 and American exchange differing by 0.09375, which is approximately equal to a monthly interest rate of 1.1% (excluding commission).</p>
<p>Few Transactions During Settlement Period</p>
<p>In the morning, the London big ticker showed British gold recovering 0.0625 both near and far term. New York's silver price remained stable, London raw gold was stable, foreign exchange rate: British to American, British to Shanghai, and British to France were stable. American to British reduced by 0.125, American to Shanghai decreased by 0.1, American to France slightly by 0.0875. The central exchange's listed prices for all currencies remained the same. At the opening of the bank spot market, the selling price of British gold was 4/8.125, and American exchange was 7.8125, which was 0.015625 tighter for British and slightly softer by 0.03125 for American compared to the previous closing. Soon after the opening, Hong Kong telegraph came to sell spot British gold at 4/8.28125 and 8.4375, followed by speculators selling December British gold to a certain bank at 4/7.8125, and the situation returned to stability. HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by a large half. Afterwards, a money exchange house sold American dollar bills to a certain bank at 7.9375, followed by Hong Kong telegraph releasing a total of US$200,000 in favorable American exchange to China and Belgium certain bank at 7.875. Therefore, the process was stable. Subsequently, transactions suddenly became rare and unusually sluggish, and the situation remained stagnant until the noon closing. The bank's spot selling price for British gold was 4/8.28125, and for American exchange it was 7.84375, which was 0.015625 looser for British and 0.03125 firmer for American compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Buy Forward American Exchange</p>
<p>The situation in the afternoon remained quiet, but the underlying trend was slightly softening due to Chinese banks buying forward American exchange. Chinese banks settled December American exchange with Datong certain bank at 7.75. There were very few reports of spot market activity. By the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price for British gold was 4/8.125, and for American exchange it was 7.8125. December British gold was 4/7.65625, and December American exchange was 7.71875. As a result, spot prices were 0.015625 tighter for British and 0.03125 softer for American compared to the previous day. There was no difference in futures prices.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Sees Little Change</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with neither rises nor falls in spot or futures British exchange, remaining at 1/2.96875.

<h3>Securities Market Vague</h3>
<p>Yesterday's informal securities market situation saw a decrease in fatigue but an increase in stagnation. People were restless and did not know what to do. However, there were certainly many future changes, and both bullish and bearish factors were being speculated on by all parties. The current situation seemed to favor bullish positions because the eighth repayment of principal and interest was approaching, and people were inevitably anxious. The morning's trading saw extremely rare transactions due to the large number of onlookers, and the market price was extremely stagnant. In the afternoon, there were initial purchases of the 20th, and then Tongkang covered their short positions, slightly improving the market by 0.1-0.2. Then, there were more sales of the 64th, and the market decreased again, and the situation became increasingly erratic. As a result, the three types of Jia, Ding, and Wu were completely unchanged, and the two types of Bing and Yi decreased slightly by 0.05 or 0.15. The total number of transactions was around 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Great China Match Company were transacted at a price of 18 yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Industry Association still saw little change, and there were few transactions. The steel stock was uniquely firm and expensive, and the rest were mediocre. The trend of rubber stocks was stable.</p>

<h3>Grain - Manipulative Forces Control the Shanghai Rice Market - Rice Prices Had Already Decreased Slightly in the Morning - Hoarding by Banks Drives Prices Up Again</h3>
<p>In recent times, the rice market has been rising and falling, seemingly unpredictable, but ultimately fluctuating only within one or two yuan. A high is immediately followed by a low, a rotating cycle, which can be called a spiraling situation. Initially, yesterday's market saw the trend weaken due to the lingering effects of the previous day, but after the price was reduced, it tightened again. Therefore, the closing price did not see much fluctuation. The general brokers in the morning, in a market that constantly changed and was difficult to grasp, adopted a conservative approach after seeing the market turn soft, and did not dare to make rash moves. The brokers' psychology was influenced by the fact that those who had held on at high prices had a lot of inventory, and they knew that the rumors were inaccurate and the supply was continuous. Thirty or more cars of goods from the Suzhou-Jiaxing area arrived at the port, and large quantities of foreign rice, constantly arriving in Shanghai, were always counted in the tens of thousands. Those with decisions in transit were also arriving one after another, and they were deeply afraid of being controlled by them, which would be irreversible. Due to these reasons, they decided to sell early. Moreover, the market was fatigued, and there were few inquiries. The large number of foreign rice in the hands of the Beiyang group was unique, and they frequently sold it at low prices. For example, Saigon rice was as low as 33 yuan, and the heart was even more anxious, so they gradually lowered the price and uniformly released it, so the sales market became more sluggish. By midday, all goods had fallen by more than one yuan. As for the general hoarders and speculators, who wanted to take the opportunity to rebuild their foundations, they saw the price decreasing all the way and thought the time was right to buy in cheaply, unleashed their manipulative forces, and greatly controlled the market. In an instant, the situation became tight again and stirred up excitement, and the local shopkeepers, who had been watching for a long time, also took action and followed suit. The sales market was lively, and the market price rebounded. For example, Saigon followed closely and had reached 34 yuan, and all the prices that had fallen in the morning were restored, so the closing price was no different from the previous market, and it can be called a stable situation.</p>
<p>The early market for customer's indica rice was quite weak, because the sources from Jing, Wu, Jiangbei continuously arrived, and foreign rice poured in again, and Jiangbei had a whole batch waiting to be loaded. Therefore, the opening price was suppressed by the latecomers, going down about half a yuan compared to the previous day. However, after the price was slightly lower, shopkeepers and hoarders absorbed the rice. It is said that the large households in the banking industry were greedy, resulting in the market rebounding by nearly one yuan, and the final price was 0.3-0.5 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>74,500 bags of foreign rice have been shipped from Hong Kong in recent days. The earliest batch of Saigon orders will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. It is said that the total is about 40,000 bags. There are already road goods sold on the market at 39.05 yuan, so the early morning market was quite fatigued, and the price was 0.5-0.6 yuan lower. In the afternoon, large households stocked up and absorbed the rice, and the price rebounded by nearly one yuan. High-quality foreign rice reached 35 yuan again, while broken rice, which had fallen to 27-28 yuan a few days ago, rose to 29.5 yuan and 29.2-3 yuan due to low prices.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Becomes Tighter - Wheat Creates New High Price</h3>
<p>The current flour market situation continues to be tight. The guest route sales market shows that both the northern and southern groups are making arrangements, but the quota is not smooth because the raw material prices are expensive and the cost is high, and the factories are not willing to supply as much as possible. The retail transactions on this street are also not very smooth due to the end of the month, but they are all bought by hoarders, so the market remains tight. It is heard that the board price of Flour Mill No. 2 on this street is still 7.6 yuan, while the guest board price is 7.7 yuan, and the return of goods store list has to be raised by 0.05-0.1 yuan. The total turnover of the city is about 40,000 bags. There are also 2,000-3,000 bags of miscellaneous flour from the mainland being transacted, all of which are on this street, at a price of 7.0-7.05 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation is even more lively, because the Shanghai market is rising again and again, and the price of domestic products is increasing accordingly, resulting in a decrease in supply. Holders are unwilling to sell easily and are hoarded by merchants. Therefore, although the factory stores are good, sellers are few. As a result, the factories only transacted 2,000-3,000 bags yesterday, and the price was still at 12 yuan, while the price for delivery in stores has exceeded the 12-yuan mark, creating a new high price. It is heard that 4-5 trucks of goods were transacted in the market, and the highest price has reached 12.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market - Soybean Oil Manipulation - Not Resting Until 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The manipulative elements in the soybean oil market are aiming for the price of Dalian iron bucket oil to reach 100 yuan per load (Si Ma weight), so the opening price yesterday rose by another 3.5 yuan (93.5 yuan on the 28th), to 97 yuan. The company with long positions released 10 barrels, and others followed suit by about one yuan. A total of 20 barrels of Qingdao Xiang oil were transacted at a price of 95 yuan. The price of road goods was 94 yuan. 100 loads of oil from this factory were at 76.5 yuan, 150 pieces of Yantai and Qi oil were at 71.5 yuan, 200 pieces of Qing Qi oil road goods were at 70.05 yuan, and 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were at 69.5 yuan. Because peanut oil lacks manipulators, it relies entirely on actual sales, so the underlying trend has stabilized. Yesterday, Jiaozhou oil still opened at 71 yuan, and 100 pieces were transacted, purchased by this street, etc. The Hong Kong group purchased 1,000 tins of Jiangbei tinned oil at a price of 93 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 340 pieces of soybean oil came from Yantai, 5,000 bags of soybeans and 30 pieces of tung oil came from Tianjin. Today, 420 bags of soybeans and 295 tins of raw oil were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - American Cotton Spot Price - Exceeds 10-Cent Mark - Local Cotton is Strong</h3>
<p>The transaction of domestic cotton is not weak, but less than the previous day. The market price is stable, not much different from the previous day. In fact, the buying and selling among peers has been prosperous for consecutive days, and it was slightly quiet today. However, the Qingdao area purchased a relatively large amount of American cotton lint and cotton flowers, so the market is still tight. This is because the overseas European and American cotton markets are all rising, and the price of Indian cotton is rising unusually sharply. The spot price of American cotton has exceeded the 10-cent mark. This situation is exciting for those with long positions, so the foundation of the cotton market is more expensive than the yarn market, and the yarn factories have reopened the sale of large quantities of cotton yarn. It is inevitable that the raw materials will have to be compensated in the future. The sources from northern Jiangsu include 1,998 bags of lint and 1,435 bags of Changyinsha. The current situation of domestic cotton is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another message: The foreign cotton market price. The New York cotton market was firm early in the morning, and dispatches from Liverpool and Mumbai all reported increases. Overseas cotton merchants are uniformly bullish on American cotton, so they have come to buy, so the cotton price is unusually outstanding. Subsequently, spot traders were also actively trading, resulting in the closing price rising by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose sharply by 14 rupees yesterday, including forecasts. Egyptian rose by more than 60 pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 10 pence.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days, but all parties unanimously expect higher prices for raw cotton, but they are suffering from the difficulty of getting started due to the current high price. Yesterday, Shenxin Factory opened 7,000-8,000 pieces of 20s Double Horse yarn, and it is expected that American cotton will be active in the coming days. The factory price of American cotton yesterday, converted at a US exchange rate of 7.8125, is as follows:</p>
<h3>Yarn Market is Led by Cotton - Shenxin Opens More Than 9,000 Bales of Future Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sluggish yarn market, assisted by the uniform rise of Indian and American cotton markets overseas, saw the market rise again, but actual transactions were still quiet. This is because all parties have traffic obstacles, and transportation cannot be rapid, so business cannot develop. However, in general, speculators, in view of the fact that foreign cotton is jumping like this, are eager to try, and there are not a few who are searching in the market. Unfortunately, actual sales cannot rise, which is a bit of a disappointment. However, the cotton market is firm, the factory's cost has increased. It is heard that Shenxin No. 9 Factory has opened a large quantity of 20s Double Horse yarn, 9,150 bales, at a price of 675 yuan, and the term is January-February next year, with a deposit of 60 yuan per bale.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, the members of the yarn industry gathered to talk and mostly thought positively, because American cotton has risen and Indian cotton has jumped even more sharply, so the goal is to see a major price hike, and the opening price rose by 14 yuan, the price of 20s Double Horse was 678 yuan. However, all the transactions were among peers for 10 bales, and the customer's group was inactive, and the market once held back, and slowly fell back, falling to 670 yuan. By the time of the closing, it had risen again by 3-4 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day show 1,277 bales, with the market price of 20s Double Horse rising by 8 yuan, Heavenly Girl rising by 9 yuan, and Double Globe rising by 7 yuan. Today, 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - East Piece Goods Transactions Are Prosperous</h3>
<p>The cloth market still lacks large spot sales, because the cloth price is lower than the cost, the factory board is unattainable, and the yarn and cotton have also risen sharply, so the cloth board is firm. Retail hand-held coarse cloth is still being sold at 0.1-0.2 cheaper than the market, but the amount is not large. The price of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth has risen by 0.2-0.3 per piece. The price of fine yarn goods has increased as the raw material price has risen sharply, and customers have a strong interest in spring poplin and other goods. Qingfeng striped plain poplin has opened for orders of more than 500 boxes. On this street, over 200 bales of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, various factory coarse cloth, and fine twill have been transacted. Over 10,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and velvet cloth have been transacted. The Guangdong group has purchased over 2,000 pieces of Tongfeng floral velvet and 100-200 bales of fine cloth and coarse cloth. The ports of Suzhou and Anhui, Bengbu and Wuhu, have added quite a lot, but the situation in various ports in eastern Zhejiang is quiet. 29 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The market board for East piece goods, fine cloth, and fine twill was still strong yesterday, as peers on this street and off-street hoarders continued to search for them. In the morning, the market price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth hovered between 19.15 and 19.2. In the afternoon, Dongmian Ito and other firms opened up futures Dragon Head next month which caused prices of $20 per piece, the market sentiment became even stronger and spot sales once rose to $19.55. Later due to profit taking, dropped to $19.3, and at closing rose again to $19.45. Spot transactions for the day were over 1,000 pieces.

<h3>How to Correct Children's Bad Habits</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>A few days ago, this publication discussed the issues of children's education and punishment. I saw an experimental education article on correcting children's bad habits in a foreign magazine. I am sharing a few examples as a reference for elementary school teachers and parents.</p>
<p>A child, in a fit of anger, picks up a vase and tries to smash a glass window. An ordinary parent or teacher would definitely scold him and kick him out. However, the teacher at the experimental school doesn't. Instead, they say, "Go ahead and throw it! If you are prepared to pay for it." The child rudely asks, "How should I pay?" The teacher says, "A few afternoons without swimming. You should know how many swimming tickets this piece of glass is worth."</p>
<p>The child falls silent, and from then on, he gains the concept of "responsibility." Even if he breaks the glass, scolding is useless. Scolding has no relation to the loss from the damage.</p>
<p>A child who frequently steals small amounts of money is sent to the experimental school by his parents. After investigation, it is found that the money the child steals is used to buy friendship and is given to his friends. This is because his parents treat him very coldly and do not give him the emotional support he needs, leading to this bad outcome. The experimental school gives him what he needs, and he becomes a good child.</p>
<p>One day, a girl in the school plays outside for the entire day. The next day when she returns to school, the teacher doesn't scold her. Instead, they say, "You made us very unhappy. We like you so much, and we missed you so much when we didn't see you for a day. Come on, let's comb your hair. This is our only request!" She happily complies. She regards this good deed as glorious and unforgettable, while she also regards the "bad deed" she accidentally committed as shameful and unforgettable.</p>
<p>From these three cases, it can be seen that to correct children's bad habits, we should start from the source of the bad habits to be effective. Simply scolding and beating the child will not make him understand his mistakes. However, because the underlying cause is not eliminated, he often unknowingly commits the offense again. Then, I ask, what is the use of scolding?</p>
<p>There is also another point: children like to be praised. We often see parents indulge their children in a distorted way, but rarely see them praise and encourage their children. If a child does a good deed, praise will make him decide to do it again. If a child is about to do a good deed, praise will help him accomplish it quickly. This kind of psychology is actually present in adults as well, but because adults are more "worldly," the effect of praise is smaller. Pure childlike hearts need some encouragement.</p>
<p>When parents are troubled by their children's bad habits, and when teachers are angry at the naughtiness of elementary school students, if they punish them, they must consider the effectiveness of the punishment. Treating children as punching bags is not right. They should seek a fundamental solution, as mentioned above, I believe.</p>
<h3>Suggestions Regarding School Meal Fees</h3>
<p>— Zhang Fuyong</p>
<p>After reading a certain parent's article on "Increasing Meal Fees" in Chunqiu, in addition to expressing deep "admiration" for those rice merchants, I also feel that there are "two points" that can be suggested to the wise school authorities:</p>
<p>Originally, the payment of meal fees in ordinary schools is stipulated to be paid in one lump sum. This is to allow the kitchen to make accurate budgets, which is a very legitimate and sufficient reason and cannot be disputed. However, at a time like the present, when prices are soaring and fluctuating in the isolated island, if we still rigidly adhere to the existing rules and implement the regulations that "meal fees are paid in one lump sum, any surplus will be returned, and any deficit will be supplemented," I absolutely cannot agree. This is because there are many drawbacks to this. The most obvious is the "teacher engaging in the rice business" and the "school swallowing a large sum of money under the guise of a minor incident" that a certain parent personally experienced.</p>
<p>Of course, those teachers "engaging in the rice business" are not "good teachers," and schools that "swallow a large sum of money" are not "good institutions." However, there are still many excellent schools on the isolated island that are committed to "cultivating talents for a hundred years" and diligently training young people. I sincerely hope that these places where pillars of society are being molded will maintain warm emotions between teachers, students, and parents and not be driven to extremes by the issue of meal fees.</p>
<p>However, this is not a simple matter of concession, but a need to fundamentally improve the method of paying meal fees. Precisely because the cost of living on the isolated island is determined by fluctuations in market prices, I believe that the payment of meal expenses must be implemented on a "monthly basis"—the amount of the monthly meal fee should be determined based on the market prices of various goods within that month. If market prices rise, there is no need to be polite; an appropriate proportion can be increased. At this time, I think parents will understand the difficulties of the school authorities and the kitchen. Similarly, when market prices fall, the cost of meals for that month should also be reduced as much as possible. Do not adopt the base goal of "money first" and lose conscience by "taking advantage of the fire" completely forgetting that you are a sacred "educator."</p>
<p>I can list a few advantages of this method of paying meal fees monthly below:</p>
<p>(1) Determining the monthly meal fee based on the rise and fall of market prices can not only avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between the two parties but also enable parents with tight finances to easily implement so-called "installment payments," avoiding being driven to the "end of their rope" due to the meal fees for several children at the beginning of the school term.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminates the drawbacks criticized by a certain parent, such as "not increasing prices when they rise, but increasing them by 60% when they fall."</p>
<p>(3) At a minimum, the school can manage the meals smoothly, and parents can express satisfaction with the payment of fees, avoiding disputes over meal fees.</p>
<p>This method has already been implemented by several schools. I believe that schools that have not yet implemented this method and are still experiencing difficulties may as well try it, and they will definitely achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and the Old City; Narrating the Vestiges of Marriage Robbery</p>
<p>He Liyu asked: "How did Shanghai prosper again later?" Shao Huihua said: "At that time, I was studying abroad and could not know all the details. But I only knew that China was recovering after the war, and Shanghai was gradually prospering again. The first reason was that China was gradually transforming from an agricultural country into an industrial country. This was what an economist studying China told me when I was abroad. He said: During the Sino-Japanese War, the wealthy from the interior all fled to Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai had a lot of floating capital. The deposits in many banks, even with restrictions on withdrawals, were more than before the war. However, once a person has money, they always want to use it and cannot simply store it in the bank. There are also some people who simply don't trust banks. They have suffered losses from banks several times, so they have thousands or tens of thousands of banknotes hidden in iron boxes at home. There are also some who like to engage in speculative activities, doing things like short selling and buying short. Whether it's public bonds, gold, cloth, or flour, they are not experts themselves. They are complacent when they get a small profit, but when they try to do it on a larger scale, they end up with a big loss. There are also some who take this opportunity to do things that benefit themselves at the expense of others, such as hoarding rice, piling up coal, and buying and selling copper and iron. When the European war started, they thought: Many people made a fortune during the First European War, so paints, western medicine, newspapers, wool, etc., were all stockpiled in the market. In fact, there was no shortage of goods in the market to control, and there were still ways to transport them in when the shipping routes were not cut off. However, after this monopoly, goods were scarce, and the market was chaotic. This is what I mean by those who are good at using their floating capital. Some who are not good at using it send their floating capital to all the gambling houses. So, during the Sino-Japanese War, it was precisely when the gambling houses in Shanghai were rampant, and every gambling house was packed with people, extravagant and wanton, all you could see were banknotes and chips. Why was this so? It was because floating capital was filling Shanghai! As for other entertainment places, dance halls, young men and women, resulting in tragedies, there is no need to talk about them. However, once the war is over, it cannot be like this again, and the floating capital cannot be allowed to float around anymore. Now that Shanghai has changed its face, improper businesses will be strictly banned. The exchange is not allowed to do futures trading, and short selling is of course extinct. Basically, in a word, all the people's capital is used for normal purposes. What is the proper use? It is post-war industrial development. Even if you want to make a fortune, you have to put in the effort and contribute to society. If you do those speculative activities, how is this different from gambling?" (209)</p>
<h3>Unreasonable Child Punishment Method</h3>
<p>— Yu Jia</p>
<p>My younger sister studies at the elementary school affiliated with a certain girls' middle school on Dagu Road. Yesterday, she came home and told me that a classmate in the first grade at her school was caught stealing someone else's pencil eraser. The teacher put a piece of paper on her chest that said "I steal things," forced her to stand in a public place so that all the students could see her, and encouraged everyone to humiliate her. She was just a nine-year-old girl, so ashamed that her face turned green. When I heard this, I couldn't help but shiver. Ah! This is the so-called new-style child education? This is following the Ministry of Education's regulations prohibiting corporal punishment?</p>
<p>The fate of Chinese children seems to be tragic from birth. Just escaping from the torture of the old-fashioned private schools, they must endure this new-style spiritual flogging. Think about it, she is only nine years old. No matter how serious the crime she committed, such cruel punishment should not be inflicted on her. Moreover, the crime is nothing more than a lack of self-control, taking something she liked that was not hers. Logically, we really cannot be too demanding of a nine-year-old girl. Of course, we must not ignore or condone the mistakes she made, but wouldn't it be enough to patiently guide her and use spiritual influence to make her realize her mistakes? Shattering a young and fragile heart is by no means more civilized than inflicting physical whippings. Perhaps this teacher also thinks that killing the chicken to scare the monkey will make the other students feel terrified and rejoice in their own good fortune. That's wrong? As long as we imagine the impact that this new-style punishment can have on a child's entire life, we cannot help but be alarmed. All humans have self-esteem. Can children be an exception? Physical pain can be forgotten over time, but how will a clever teacher repair the destruction of self-esteem? Don't think it's just a piece of paper, don't think it's only posted for one day. The brand on a naive heart can never be erased, and we can predict its tragic consequences. We can imagine the contempt, ridicule, indifference, and distrust that classmates will have towards her in the future. We can assert the discrimination and mental suffering she will endure in the future. Don't think that children's hearts are simple. Precisely because their hearts are simple, they are easily crushed. Protecting them is already not enough, yet they are violently struck. Those who inflict the blows are also the elementary school teachers entrusted by parents and to whom a person's entire future is entrusted. Can we say this is excusable? What punishment are you talking about? Isn't this paper a seal that forces the child to continue her mistakes and closes the door to her reform?</p>
<p>Wise teachers! I sincerely hope that you clearly recognize your responsibilities. Your every move affects the future of countless children. Your casual words and actions will have an impact on children that you yourselves cannot measure. I don't want to say anything more about the sacredness of education, but educators should pay serious attention to the heavy burden of education, especially in this era of rapid change.</p>

<h3>Robert Taylor Talks About Screen Life</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Robert Taylor tells us that when he had just graduated from Pomona College, he naturally had to find a position to work. He said, "I was very lucky at the time. After I had the opportunity to enter the film company as a regular actor, the company authorities and the general audience looked up to me very much. I still haven't forgotten that warm encouragement and praise!"</p>
<p>Robert Taylor is truly a well-known superstar in today's Hollywood film industry. He continued to tell us: "Indeed, being engaged in screen life is not as free and easy as the average outsider imagines. However, compared to other burdensome tasks, the life under the spotlights is not the hardest. I get up at six o'clock every day, and after nine o'clock, I go to work in the photography studio. The time I go home is always after eight o'clock. I work almost twelve hours a day. Being engaged in the film industry is no different from being engaged in other departments. As an actor, there are many opportunities for promotion, as long as a person works seriously and performs well, he is sure to achieve amazing success in the film industry.</p>
<p>"Speaking personally," he also said, "movie actors can also lead any kind of life they like. On Saturday nights, he can go to various entertainment venues to recover his tired spirits from the week, just like other people.</p>
<p>When a popular movie star walks into a certain public place, of course, it will cause countless "movie fans" to go crazy. Taylor doesn't complain about this craze and commotion.</p>
<p>All in all, Taylor is very satisfied with the screen life he lives. He said, "Anyone who resents eating the movie meal should come up with some kind of amateur hobby (playing the violin, for example, is a very good example) to regulate the monotony of their life in the film industry."</p>
<h3>Eye-Protection Screen Can Prevent Movie Fans From Damaging Their Eyesight</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Movie damage to eyesight is a question of the utmost concern to movie fans and is often brought up for discussion. The main reason is the unsuitability of the screen's light. If a screen and projector lamp are too large compared to each other, out of proportion, or the reflected light is too low, or the emitted light is not strong enough to allow people sitting in every corner of the theater to see clearly, these are all sufficient to damage eyesight. Too weak light emitted from the projector lamp is another common drawback.</p>
<p>So, to remedy these shortcomings, the key is to choose screens and projectors that are suitable for every seat in the theater. According to the results of expert research, this is an engineering problem. Recently, in order to minimize screen damage to movie fans' eyesight, someone has invented a new type of Syorex screen. This is indeed a new invention for movie theaters. The Grand China Theater, which will open soon, has purchased this new type of screen and has already completed its installation.</p>
<p>The special advantage of this new type of screen is that the reflected light is the same intensity in every seat in the theater. At the same time, this screen also contains color photosensitivity, and the outside is covered with a new medium that can absorb color. As a result, whether projecting color or displaying black and white films, the light on the screen is very clear, making the audience feel extra satisfied.</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Stanley and Livingstone</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Stanley and Livingstone" is the story of New York Herald reporter Stanley's long trek through the African forest in 1870 to find British doctor Livingstone. This year is the 35th anniversary of Stanley's death, and 20th Century Fox specifically produced this "Stanley and Livingstone" to commemorate him. Stanley's spirit of hard work and courage is naturally worth commemorating by later generations. However, due to the narrow-mindedness of racial discrimination in Britain and the United States, we have seen the cruel slaughter of people of color in various tones, which sets off the "civilization" of white people in wild and war films. "Battlefield Souls" and "Gunga Din" are the most prominent examples; "Stanley and Livingstone" is naturally also produced from this perspective, although its theme has changed from "aggression" to "influence," such as Dr. Livingstone leading the natives in Africa to sing hymns, and the natives thanking him for treating their diseases, but in the end, Stanley's exposure to Africa to fulfill Dr. Livingstone's will is still their consistent policy—people of color are an inferior race, and it should be they who convert them.</p>
<p>Director King Henry seems unable to fully display his talents here. The first reason is that the story is straightforward and lacks opportunities for development; the second reason is that when Stanley penetrates the African interior, the overall organization is not concise enough. This not only fails to show Stanley's hardships, but also makes the discovery of Dr. Livingstone weak and powerless.</p>
<p>This further affects Spencer Tracy's acting skills. His Stanley, except for a few outstanding shots at the Royal Geographical Society meeting, is otherwise mediocre. Nancy Kelly and Richard Greene also did not achieve much.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Alumni Association of Xin Xin Night Middle School on Guling Road decided to hold an early performance at the Lafayette Theater at 9:30 a.m. on the 3rd to raise funds for the school. The plays are "Zhang Guan Li Dai" ("The Case of the Crown and the Boots"), "Seeking Marriage," and "Mother." The stage manager is Chen Mingxun, and the actors include Ma Ling, Han Bai, Ying Zi, Zi Mang, Shi Zhi Dong, Yi Zhong Zhi, Liu Guan Fang, etc.</p>
<p>Taiyi Boxing, passed down by the ancestor Taiyi Zhenren, has been eagerly learned by people in Shanghai in recent years and is also a way of physical education. The martial arts master Gao Shouwu has visited teachers and friends to study and practice Tai Chi, Bagua, Xingyi, and various fighting styles and has achieved considerable success. He resides at the Lao Tongshou Chinese Pharmacy on Beile Road. Those who are interested in learning can go there to receive instruction.</p>
<p>The Jianguang Drama Troupe is a newly emerging drama troupe composed of advanced youth in Shanghai. In this harsh environment of the isolated island, they are embracing a spirit of perseverance, enthusiastically shouldering the important mission of promoting cultural undertakings and improving social education. The drama department and the music department are both working actively. Currently, they have divided the members into two groups, A and B, to actively rehearse. Group A has selected the play "Ye Wei Yang" ("The Night Is Not Yet Over"), and Group B has selected "Black Hell." Both are contemporary advanced famous plays. Once the rehearsals are proficient, they will choose a date for public performance.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaoqing Newly Accepts Disciples</h3>
<p>— Jun Xin</p>
<p>Famous amateur actor Mr. Huang Jingbo is a member of the Shanghai Ping Society. He has studied drama in great depth and thoroughly investigates even the slightest nuances of each word and melody. Not only do the members of the Ping Society recognize him as a pillar of the troupe, but also everyone in Shanghai who has heard Mr. Huang's performance praises his talent. This time, Ms. Wang Yurong, daughter of Wang Yaoqing, came to Shanghai, and Mr. Huang, realizing that this was an opportunity not to be missed, and Ms. Wang Yurong (who is also a distinguished disciple of Wang Yaoqing), introduced him. Wang Yaoqing also recognized that Mr. Huang was truly a promising talent and agreed to formally accept him as a disciple. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 25th of this month, at 4:00 p.m., the apprenticeship ceremony was held at Mr. Jin's residence, with Jin Biyan as the incense master. After the ceremony, a banquet was held at Guanshengyuan. Insiders included Zhang Eyun, Chen Tongyun, Jin Bilian, Jin Biyan, and Shen Yaofang. Famous amateur actors included Bao Xiaodie, Zhao Peixin, Gao Hua, Yun Ke'an, and Sun Lanting. The gathering was very lively, and the teacher and disciple, Wang and Huang, were even more elated. After the meal, they took photos at Guanlong to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Sketches of the Entertainment World (Gan Er) Magic</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>Magic, also called illusion, the characters "magic" and "illusion" show that it is not real.</p>
<p>But real magic cannot be said to be absolutely non-existent. Such mysterious and bizarre things as "dismembering a child's body into several pieces and then being able to restore it" are said to be still performed by some people on the streets. Unfortunately, I have never seen it with my own eyes, which is a great regret!</p>
<p>The magic performed on stage now is mostly the so-called "Western magic" after the "Eastern expansion of European customs." The key lies entirely in the special construction of the props.</p>
<h3>Extracurricular Notes</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Silly Gentlemen in the Peking Opera World of Peiping</p>
<p>After a while, Rongfu led the tour of the various courtyards in his mansion, as well as the precious antiques, rosewood, and various utensils. Later, I heard from the elders of the old capital that during the late Qing Dynasty, when Empress Dowager Cixi ruled behind the curtain, Rong was Minister of Internal Affairs. All items presented from various places had to be reviewed by Rong Xiang first. Rare treasures were often intercepted by him for his mansion. In addition, in order to please Rong Xiang, foreign vassals sometimes prepared two copies of each item, both to avoid the disaster of being intercepted and to be presented for imperial review as soon as possible. Therefore, the treasures collected in Rong's mansion were indeed numerous and exquisite. That day, my colleague, engineer Bill (an American), and I were fortunate to feast our eyes, ears, mouth, and nose (there was a kind of Western snuff, but it was the first time my Western friend had smelled it). By the time I went to Peiping again in 1933, I suddenly heard that Rong had already sold his house, and all the furniture in the house had been forcibly taken away. Speaking of it, this matter was really absurd and ridiculous. It turned out that Zhifeng was also a careless ghost. Apart from eating, drinking, and having fun, he did not personally handle even the biggest things. Later, he met a person outside and opened a flower shop. He played with fresh flowers all day long, and he stayed outside with the flowers for twenty-seven or eight days out of the month. Slowly, he ran into deficit and was forced by the creditors, so he thought of selling the property. (West Mansion) Coincidentally, Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, had long wanted to buy a large mansion in Peiping to compete with Wan Fulin's mansion (Wan had also purchased the old mansion of a prince. After renovation, it was magnificent and majestic, the crown of private residences in the city). Someone brought them together, and they agreed on a price of 100,000 yuan. Before and after, the entire transaction was handled by a manager in the Rong mansion. Rong Jun did not want to lose face by selling his ancestral property, and he was afraid that the East Mansion would come out to stop him, so he always hid in the dark and rarely went home! (153)</p>
