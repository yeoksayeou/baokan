<h3 id="c10">國際外交之新紀元？ <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>英國首相張伯倫氏，近盡瘁於東歐大局，有聲有色；三日下午，在彼下議院演說之際，頗自負為英國外交闢新紀元。其國內朝野各黨，塈其民治友邦之政家報人，亦翕然稱之曰，是新紀元之始也。雖然，是可以當新紀元而無媿乎？我人衷誠祝望些老成功，願尤願為新紀元更進一言。</p>
<p>所謂外交，自有其正常之涵義，莊嚴之解釋者也。國家之於外交，不容侮弄，非可輕蔑，是乃立國國際之大政。然以客觀之惑於變態，主觀之誤入歧途，寖假而違其本旨，喪其本相，由來蓋久矣。如謂「外交辭令」，應為最偉大，最準確，最真誠，最熱情，於以取得最高信任之文字語言；願乃今人於外交辭令，幾乎一體視為蔽真尚偽之诐辭，諉卸責任之遁辭；聞者惑之而唾棄之，但亦以為外交辭令固若是也；言者以為得計，以為盡辭令之能事，以為為外交而發，固應若是也。如謂「外交手腕」，應為合情合理合時，務期彼此切實兩利之作為；願乃今人於外交手腕，幾乎一體現為欺騙脅諉之手法，爾詐我虞之鬥法；此固心術不端，但為外交而不厭詐；彼則戒懼，姑且虛相委蛇而已。夫為國家辦外交而惟诐辭遁是尚，惟虛相委蛇，謂非誤解外交，誤入歧途不可也。緣是而貽禍蒼生，顛覆邦國者，史實不勝舉也。</p>
<p>國際聯盟會之誕生，各會員俱與有力焉；其動念甚真，其後果至劣；其盟約幾為國際欺騙之歷史的文獻，其組織幾為國際外交集騙局之大成。主宰之者，或臨難卑怯，或根本不誠；愛護之者，如中國，徒得所謂道德之慰藉；依賴之者，如阿比西尼亞，夷為奴隸而呼籲無門。自是厥後，西班牙問題發生，則有道貌儼然之不干涉政策；在此方式之下，可以遠禍。可以避餘殃，可以空言抗議而坐視干涉，可以忍受欺騙而且降志周旋。捷克問題發生，則敝屣互助協定之不足，更以慕尼黑協定助虐，行所無事，恬不為恥；而捷克既不獲以互助協定求全，亦未能以慕尼黑協定圖存。亡者如逝，而稱道和平之功在於綏靖。歐洲國際，迄無戰事；相應答者，外交辭令也；相維繫者，外交手腕也。</p>
<p>及德意志亡捷克，世論囂然；此非有愛於捷克，僅懼禍患己及，兔死狐悲之同情，遂籠罩歐陸。乃有論者，謂容忍至極度矣，綏靖告失敗矣，侵略者野心無所底止，至是而昭然若揭；道德家恍然大悟，政治家幡然改圖矣。事或誠然，願就遍傳遐邇之消息研求之，凡上所述，猶是欺人之談。不憶英國倡議反侵略宣言之初期頓挫　？波蘭拒不加入，夫可為者？不慊於宣言之不脫所謂「外交辭令」所謂「外交手腕」之窼臼也；申言之，乃非偉大準確真誠熱情之語言文字，乃為不足信任之作為也；質言之，英國絕未大悟，絕未改圖，依然因不願負責而發為絕無拘束效力之空言也。英人之答復德國者曰，「德國鄰邦，不能忘情於德國之屢次食言而肥，斯惟有團結一體，反抗侵略；」其實此種責備暴力侵略婆婆邏輯方式，至少迄英國倡議反侵略宣言為止，完全可以取為責備虛偽外交之邏輯方式。如此外交，何疑乎無數蒼生，若干邦國之為所犧牲乎？</p>
<p>今英國破棄其傳統之政策矣，慨然接受約束，予波蘭以保障之不已，且將保障羅馬尼亞；更不惟如此而已，張伯倫氏並謂「英國所接受之約束，不僅適用於一種指定之情事，其目標實欲以遏止以武力控制全世界之任何企圖」云。如此鑿鑿言之，泃乎其為新紀元矣。願與此「新紀元」之宣言共始者，有若昨日歐美若干人士之高論焉；其意蓋謂惟此政策，始可制止戰爭而保和平。夫如是云云，亦自有其真理；良以侵略之所由不已，乃由退讓之不己；揆之往事，誠然若此。然尤必體認明白者，強硬政策之於遏止侵略，可效而非必然；其於維繫和平，亦為可效而非必效；惟非必效，故不應視此新紀元為足以制止戰爭而保和平。換一方面言之，僅求制止戰爭而保和平，乃為侵略國家所早已覷破之「外交辭令」與「外交手腕」，故不足以當「新紀元」之稱！蓋必作戰爭必不可免之假定，必有以戰爭遏止侵略之決心，以戰爭建樹永久和平基礎之決心；掃蕩陳陳相因之外交辭令與外交手腕，使外交成為真誠行動之外交；新紀元於是始。</p>
<p>完成此新紀元者，英法波蘭而外，夙具同心之國家，尤如美國蘇俄，應慨然合作，立即參加；而在英法波蘭，則尤必以至勇，為新紀元之中堅，即使不獲他國後盾，亦決心赴之；是則人類最光輝之新紀元，亦最偉大之成就矣！</p>

<p>（倫敦）下院今日辯　外交時、首相張伯倫在歡呼聲中、宣稱、「上星期五日余所發之宣言、乃英國前所擔任各事中及英國傳統政見中之大轉變、此項宣言、非與邊界事件有關、但與伏於邊界事件背後之大事有關如波蘭受威脅、則余確信波蘭人民必反抗之、果爾、則此宣言即作英法將立即趨前爲波蘭後援之解（衆聞言歡呼）余相信英國人民、現一致團結、不獨贊助余所頃言者、且贊助余言所含蓄之目的與旨趣，余且信整個英帝國亦皆同此贊助、國外英帝國各部、曾注視吾人對於和平之努力、而抱此種努力可吿成功之熱切期望、今彼等皆自覺近數月來歐洲迭遭出人意外與恐慌事件、吾人不能久在此驚倐恐慌的氣氛中生活、而吾人共同生涯、不能久在此紛擾不定的狀况中進行矣、政府已就其所可能者、以明白詞句、擬挽回信任、余知政府之爲此、確已表示英國人民之志願」云、省相於發言之初、追述去年九月危局時言及希特勒對英國及世界而發德國不願支配其他民族、僅欲使位於毘運區域內德人歸化其本國境內之諾言、謂「當時希特勒向吾人聲稱、此事一經辦到、即從此終止、德國未有續得土地之野心、不意此項諾言、今已完全拋棄、信任爲之破壞無遺、英政府乃不得不改變其政策、吾人頃又聞德國之併吞捷克、尚有兩種理由、一爲歷史上之聯繫、一爲遭人攻擊之惶懼、此縱言之成理、然如與前發諾言不相適應何、（聽衆歡呼）事有必然者、彼等於將來擴充土地時、亦將有詞可藉、余今日非謂現已有此挑釁、就余所知之官塲文吿、從未有佈吿此種野心者、惟官塲之議論、已數見不鮮矣、近來事件影響所及、已遠至有關係的國家之外、或較造成此事件者之預料影響尤遠、</p>
<p>不問政制岐異歡迎蘇聯合作</p>
<p>首相機言及包圍德國之說、謂指自衛政策爲含有侵略作用之包圍政策、實屬荒謬、余今日不願說明吾人今日或今後所將與之商榷時局者爲何國政府、但余現可發關於蘇聯之一言、因余深知蘇聯無時不在反對派議員之心目中、且知反對派議員現猶稍抱疑念、不知所謂思想上歧異者、能否使吾人在變方互有關係之事件中、不致各行其是也、余不諱言思想上異點之存在、異見今仍未變、惟吾人立塲以爲無論思想上異見如何、然在此種大問題中、則眞正無足計較、吾人今所注重者、爲保持吾人獨立、余於此所謂吾人獨立者、即可被侵略者威脅之各國獨立、是以吾人歡迎任何國之合作、而不問其政體內部制度如何、此非用以侵略、但用以抵抗侵略、</p>
<p>對波約束宣言務使實施有效</p>
<p>首相繼稱、今日辯論之結果、可昭示世人下院在根本上一致贊同星期五日所發之宣言、下院將表示其以團結與堅決的精神、採行任何必要計劃、使宣言實施有效、星期五日之宜言、確爲英國外交政策中之新的偉大的轉變、而於前外相艾登在其著名演詞中、代表英政府對衆公布之愼重規定的義務之外、續有一種束縛、星期五日之宣言、至爲明顯、無誤會之可能、此非斤斤邊界事件之細故、但注重於隱伏在邊界事件後之大事、在波蘭獨立是、波蘭邊界果遭威脅、則波蘭人民必起而反抗、而英法亦將立即爲波蘭後援、此即星期五日宣言之意義也、首相又述其去年九月二十七日所發廣播吿國人文中「余爲和平人、余視國際武裝衝突爲魔鬼、但余若知仟何一國決心欲以武力支配世界、則定以爲必須予以抵抗、因在此種支配中、信仰自由之人民將覺不值得生活也」前言、並謂渠當時認德國對捷克之要求、未必即爲德國支配之意思、故渠覺未便請求國人接受新義務、渠後對於羅斯福總統新年文吿、又曾表示意見、以爲果若一國欲支配他國之要求、如美總統所言者、非抵抗不可、</p>
<p>切望德方覺悟干戈化為玉帛</p>
<p>首相繼向下院說明德國如何破壞希特勒親自所發諾言、致摧毀世人信任、而使英政府不得不改變其態度之經過情形、謂「近來事件、使舉世爲之震駭、英國全境皆覺現有闢明英國地位之絕對必要、余發此言、實不得已、余非爲好戰者、今日猶如去年九月、余不欲以英國人民所不願有之待遇加諸德國人民、余前曾屬望在德業已開始的商業討論之結果、有益於英德兩國與其他諸國、但信任今已撼動、非可容易修復、如德國果從事於武力支配世界之希圖、則事後之進行不止於今日、如德政府從無稱霸之念、則甚善矣、因果如是、則志在保障顯被威脅的各國獨立之任何協定、可無須見諸實施也、余期望吾人行動今方開始、而未終止者可爲非趨向毫無所獲毫無所補亦毫無所止的戰爭、但趨向理智代替武力理論代替威脅的新時代之轉點」云、</p>

<p>自由反對黨領袖辛克萊繼起發言、謂渠認所給予波蘭之臨時保證、乃目前大局中之一項、此爲必需之一項、苟渠非承認錯誤者、政府之目的、得保在可能的戰爭中獲勝、實不若消弭戰爭發生之有把握、希特勒志在統制全世界、今對此已無爭執矣、故弭戰之唯一途徑、顯爲造成對侵略作無敵之抵抗、並使希特勒與其部下將領了然無疑、如彼等攻擊任何鄰國、必在兩方面遭遇戰爭、英國人民固厭惡戰爭、但當希特勒知英政府將規避最後一着之戰爭之際、決不能與之談判成功也、</p>

<h3 id="c43">莫斯科公佈　漁業協定談判經過　日本對蘇屈膝所獲成就 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>（莫斯科）關于四月二日簽字之蘇日漁業協定、蘇聯報紙頃公佈議定書及李維諾夫致日本大使柬鄕之節略二件全文、附以塔斯社關于該事件之評述、內容如下、</p>
<p>日方在蘇聯領海內之捕魚權係由樸茨茅斯和約取得、截至最近、係由一九二八年之漁業公約及一九三二年之附約節制、按照該公約、日方應由拍賣取得漁場、按照附的、則僅新漁塲執行拍賣、而過去由日方經營之舊漁塲、則根據租約自動租與日人、公約及附約之期限、早于一九三六年十二月滿期、同時日政府並曾宣佈取消該公約、其意顯欲于締結新公約時、爲該國漁人、取得更廣大之樺利、一九三六年開始之新長期漁業公約談判、囚日方採取極端顯著之反蘇政策、特別表現于反共產國際公約假面具下之日德同盟、未曾得到結果（因而一九二八年公約及附約、乃于一九三七年及一九三八年兩次各延、長一年、</p>
<p>一九三八年十一月、日方提議再開新公約談判、蘇聯政府當答以必須日政府履行担保「滿洲國」中東路付款條件、（截至現在、「滿洲國」尚未繳付末期價款）、方允舉行此種談判、其後日政府不間意此條件　蘇聯政府遂同意僅能談判一年之臨時漁業約定、此外、人民外交委員會曾與日本駐蘇大使館交換節略及備忘錄多次、蘇聯政府自始即宣佈已決定關于新漁塲及過去由日人經當之漁塲、均恢復拍賣制度、關于其他條件、則準備根據一九二八年公約締結臨時協定、惟該公約第八條之規定、即凡經開放之漁塲不能封閉、而必須拍賣或不經拍賣而交與承租人經營、不能繼續有效、關于此點、蘇聯政府宣佈決定因軍略原因、收回日方經營之漁塲四十處、內有附屬于罐頭廠者四處、及租約至一九四一年方滿者一處、其後蘇聯政府允將應收回之漁塲减爲三十七處、此外、蘇聯政府並反對原公約中、規定日方得以干涉蘇聯國立漁業捕魚額量一點、原公約限制此額量爲二百萬蒲德、</p>
<p>此在日方則堅執反對拍賣、要求所有漁塲租約之自動延長、不論過去由日方經營或租約業已滿期均應如此、日方尤其堅持反對三十七處漁塲之收回、而提出全無根據之理由稱、過去日人已得者全部爲「安定」漁塲、必須永歸日人經營、日方又堅稱、荀採用拍賣制度、則蘇聯國家漁業經營之漁塲、亦應一律拍賣、嗣後日方首决同意十二處漁塲之收回、繼又增至二十四處、惟耍求應以同數及價值相等、並由日方選擇之漁場代替、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府斷然拒絕以其他漁塲代替或補償因任何原因從日方收回的漁塲之原則、關于上述爭執問題、日方要求之根據僅爲撲茨茅斯和約、而如疊次曾向日方指出者、該和約並未規定漁塲租與日人之程序、或日人經營漁塲之數目、或日方漁塲之所謂「安定性」、或蘇聯因有漁塲之限制、此外並經指出、該和約業經日方本身違犯多次、日方因其正式立塲荏弱、乃屢圖援引漁業公約及附約中之相應條文、而不問其業已滿期從而不能拘束蘇聯政府之事實、及至日方顯已同意接受拍賣制度、並放棄所謂安定原則之後、蘇聯政府乃亦同意將自擇之額外漁塲九處提出拍賣、畀日人可以取得、</p>
<p>準此、雙方乃照下列條件成立協定、</p>
<p>第一、日方只能以拍賣方式、取得租約業已屆滿之漁塲、</p>
<p>第二、爲軍略原因、日方經營之漁塲三十七處應予收回、內有附屬於罐頭廠者四處、各該罐頭廠亦應封閉、</p>
<p>第三、三十七處漁塲中之一、因租約在一九四一年方滿、當由蘇聯政府讓與其他漁塲一所代替、限期相同、</p>
<p>第四、日方由拍賣而得之漁塲、應按照一九二八年公約成立五年租約、此點蘇聯政府自始即未反對、</p>
<p>第五、附屬於日人所設罐頭廠之漁塲、除上述四塲外、應不經拍賣續租一年、此點蘇聯政府自始亦未反對、</p>
<p>第六、與一九二八年公約之規定不同、蘇聯政府今後將自行規定國立漁業捕魚額、一九二九年度估計爲五百萬蒲德、</p>
<p>第七、蘇聯漁塲九處、應額外提付拍賣、因日方未參加三月十五日之拍賣、蘇聯漁業機關曾拍得此九處中之六處、以及日人過去經營之漁塲四處、現此諸機關已願將各該漁塲讓與日方、</p>
<p>第八、因日大使表示在拍賣中、租價恐將無限制抬高、蘇聯遠東漁業總管理局當聲明該局不準備將租價抬高至百分之十以上、</p>
<p>此次談判中爭執最劇之問題、爲恢復拍賣制度、收回日人經營漁塲三十七處、糾正關於日方漁塲安定性之虛僞理論、以及蘇聯國立漁業在遠東之特殊地位、而此諸問題均已解決、故對於現在簽定之協定、蘇聯政府及人民各界均完全滿意、（三日塔斯電）</p>

<p>再加暹羅的人口一千五百萬中，我們僑胞的人口要佔二百五十萬。除了害怕英法瓜分之外，還要擔心國內經濟權落在華僑手中。因此今天暹羅在亞洲的地位和匈矛利在歐洲的地位差不多。它所要求的是收復前世紀以來的失地，獲得眞正的獨立自主。</p>
<p>為是暹羅民族正當的要求，所不幸的。暹羅沒有用正當的革命手段，去求貫澈他的正當要求。為了反對帝國主養，反而投到帝國主義的懷抱裏。自從九一八以後，暹羅是露骨的表示親日排華的唯一亞洲國家。一九三三年問，國際聯盟通過證實日本的決議案的時候，只有暹羅棄權。暹羅境內的華僑，時時受着殘酷的待遇，抗日的言論集會自由是完全剝奪了。</p>
<p>一樣的是被壓迫民族，為什麼要自相排斥呢？這也並不奇怪，暹羅至今是半封建半殖民地的軍事獨裁國家。本來就很容易走上法西斯主義的路綫上去。叉因為要向英法報仇，雪恥，所以不自覺的落入了日本的侵略的圈套。近年暹羅的軍朕聘用了日本顧問，購買了日本軍火，政治上受日本的影饗很大。日本想貸款給暹羅，開鑿克拉運河，使遠東船舶，可以不經新加坡，直達印度洋。這一個工程假如成功，對於英國在遠東的軍事和商業地位，不用說會有嚴重的損害，這個計劃雖然因了英國的反對而暫時擱置，但是並沒有完全拋棄。自從德意日反共協定簽字之後，德國勢力也潛入暹羅。最近德國供給暹羅的軍火的數量很不少，這更加增加了英法的不安，雖然目前暹羅還沒有加入反共協定的可能，可是暹羅的政府要人已經屢次表示同情於反共集團的政府了。</p>
<p>假如暹羅投入法西斯集團的懷抱，自然要使英國在遠東的殖民地感受威脅，可是法屬越南，却比英屬緬甸更處於危險的地位。因為假如暹羅一旦加入了德意日的軍事同盟，它首先要收復鸞拍老朋省和百丹朋，此外法國保護地老撾和東浦塞，也是暹羅所要奪取的目的物。為的是老撾和東浦塞兩個民族，遠在十六世紀的時候，已經是被暹羅征服了的。這些地方喪失之後，越南領土去掉大半，加上日本從海南島方面進攻，越南決不會再是法國的越南了。</p>
<p>日本侵略華南和佔領海南島，這已使法國的遠東殖民地，為之寢食不安。加上暹羅自從上次大戰以後，軍備實力一天天增加，國內早已實行徵兵制度，戰時可動員陸軍數十萬，近年暹羅又建立海軍。從德國日本定造了戰艦和潛水艇，空軍也有相當的規模，一到了戰時，不用說是越南背面最危險的故人，所以越南和暹羅的關係，是法國在遠東殖民地安全問題中最可焦慮的一點。</p>
<p>英法對付暹羅，也像對付西班牙佛朗哥政府一樣，想用借款通商種種利益當作了引誘的。希望緩和對英法的衝突，就法國與暹羅的關係來說，最近數月來有相當的成功，越南與暹羅的商約於數月前簽字，現在已經過法國和暹羅的國會雙方批准了。法國三月前派軍官團前往盤谷聘問，這次越南軍隊及諒山附近大操，暹羅也派了兩個軍官前來閱操，目前暹羅與越南表面上保持着善鄰關係，這是實在的。可是我們知道侵略國沒有一刻會停止搗亂的陰謀，一旦歐洲戰爭爆發，法國在遠東的軍力削弱，那時候亞洲南部會演成怎樣局勢是沒有人能够保證的。為了保護他在遠東的利益，法國將倚靠怎麼力量。這不已是太明白了嗎？</p>

<p>自抗戰軍與、特區的居民、突增至四百萬以上、在淞　戰役時不論男女老幼、或服務於戰地、或支援於後方、大家參加抗敵救亡的組織、及國軍西撤、受到客觀環境的限制、救亡工作、化整為零、各個站在自己的崗位上、加緊努力、現在後期抗戰、業已急劇開始、其任務之艱巨偉大、勝前百倍、我同胞目必須加強抗敵力量、以與後期抗戰局勢、密切配合、那麼各個站在崗位上之努力、!有復歸餘集體奮鬥之必要、現在本會已正式宣告成立、各界組織、於日內即將分別成立、望我全市眾界同胞、參加眾界國民精神動員協會之支部組織、工界同胞參加工界之支部組織、商界同胞、參加商界之支部組織、教育界之教職員及學生、參加教育界之支部組織、文化界同胞、參加文化界之支部組織、其他市民.婦女.青年等、也應該參加其本界之支部組織、總之、每已各市民、都必須參加國民精神總動員協會、一致向集體奮鬥之途邁進、</p>

<p>堅定抗戰意志</p>
<p>後期抗戰、業已急劇展開、敵寇深知侵略戰之前途、衹有泥足日深、國力日衰、所以敵寇最近的軍事侵略與政治陰謀、密切配合、企圖以其最狂虐的凶焰、威脅我抗敵的精神、動搖我必勝的信念、其實我全國軍民、深信中日間百年來的血債、必須於此次抗戰中全部索償、更深信唯有舉國抗戰到底、財可以爭取我國家衹獨立自由與平等、所以敵寇　　盡野蠻慘酷之能事、非特不足威脅我精神反增加我抗戰必勝的信念、非但不足動搖我意志、反堅強（不逐敵寇、誓不休止）的決心、我們抗戰的精神、必須於敵寇威脅壓迫我加甚的期間而　發揚　　、我們抗戰的意志、必須於國民精神動員運動展開的今日、而　健全　固、凡一切敵人於漢奸所製造的和平空氣、與妥　消息、皆須絕對排斥徹底糾正、</p>
<p>掃除畏怯心理</p>
<p>自國軍西撤後、上海雖成孤島、然全市民眾、非特絕無畏怯的心理、而且抗敵救亡的精神、更形堅定奮發、尤甚於淞瀘抗戰之時、紀念節日、全市家家戶戶、國旗飛揚、即使受到無理干涉、也決不受絲毫的威脅、而有所觀望、然亦正因有三亦而的不屈不　英勇反抗、始造三二九的萬戶輝煌光明滿眼、使敵寇漢奸均無所施其伎倆、此獲大無畏的精神正使我中華民國國魂的表現、也就是我國必可爭得最後勝利的堅強保證、無所謂危險、惟危險方有意義、無所謂犧牲、惟犧牲始有價值、畏怯只是自殺的工具、反抗方使制勝的條件、這是世界民族與亡史中、已有鐵的證明、毫無疑問的、在此國民精神總動員開始實行的盡日、畏怯心理、自應掃除淨盡、大無畏精神、更當發揚光大、</p>
<p>發揚國民精神</p>
<p>在這國軍西撤一年餘的期間、上海同胞、熱愛祖國的情緒、為舉世所見、政府力量、雖已不及、但我同胞服從政府的法令、尊重政府的意旨、始終無間、這種偉大崇高的國民精神、實為中外所共　、我們希望全市同胞、今後更應把這國民精神、發揚　　、乳油　假借特殊勢力、作違法亂紀之事、當集中一切革命力量、予以最嚴厲的制裁、務使在這偉大光榮的抗戰建國歷史上、不要留下一絲一毫的污點、</p>

<p>（芬蘭特訊）國際業餘體育協進會、最近已將一九四〇年奧林匹克大會田賽「預賽成績新標準」加以規定、這次的標準中有幾項比柏林大會時要最嚴格許多、選手必須獲得所規定的最低成績、才能有參加決賽的資格、茲將各項新標準成績分列如下、</p>
<p>項目　新標準　柏林在會標準</p>
<p>跳高　一公尺八十七公分　一公尺八十五公分</p>
<p>跳遠　七公尺二十公分　七公尺十五公分</p>

<p>至於擲鐵球一項、則沒有預賽、但是比賽同時在三處舉行、至舉行預賽的幾項、當進入決賽週時、則定為十二人、如遇獲得決賽權之選手不到十二人時、則再從未入選的選手中、挑選成績最高的補足十二人的數目、譬如說標槍一項裏衹有九人、達到六十五公尺、那最接近六十五公尺的三個人就得到決賽的資格、在跳高和撐竿跳兩項中、為難免比賽耗時太久起見、國際體協委會、又定出這兩項比賽橫桿昇高的定則、跳高由一公尺七十起、繼而一公尺八十、一公尺九十、一公尺九五、一公尺九八、二公尺〇一、二公尺〇四、二公尺〇七……這樣連續上昇、同樣的、撐竿跳是由三公尺六十起跳、繼而三公尺八十、三公尺九五、四公尺一〇、四公尺二〇、四公尺三〇……關於遊艇賽之記分方法、早由去年在倫敦舉行之國際遊艇會議授權於芬蘭世運籌委會、自由決定、茲悉組織委員會遊艇股、業已決定採用淘汰制度、將來各項比賽、均以分七日舉行、以定勝負、大抵在四五日之後、速率太低之船隻、當完全淘汰、而在總決賽中、將有十一艘左右之遊艇、作最後之競爭、</p>

<h3 id="c96">科學與窮苦靑年 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>吾國今日事事需用科學一般人士皆以為科學與他種學問不同，必有敎師為之講授，有相當之設備以便實習，方能有門徑之可尋。於是社會遂認科學為貴族化，與金錢問題有密切關係，一若窮苦靑年雖天性於科學極屬相近，對科學最感興趣者，徒以家境貧寒，竟無研求科學之機會。然就科學之歷史觀之，此等觀念亦不盡然。研求科學之機會，在富有之子弟固甚多，而貧寒之子弟亦非竟為金錢所限，不得登其堂而嚌其胔，要在人之努力不懈，隨時隨地而利用之耳。卽以英國之電學大家法拉第（Farada）而論，其幼年之時極為貧窘，在一化學室充僕役，而能勤學好問，時時從德偉（Davy）敎授領敎，其後竟有驚動全世之貢獻。美國之大發明家愛迪生氏在科學上之發明，造福人類者，幾於人人皆知，而其始乃係窮苦之幼童，不能入學梭肄業，恃沿街賣報以資餬口，其一耳為人所摑，竟至終身聾瞶。凡讀其傳者，皆知其幼年顚連之狀况，而能一意以求科學，終能有空前之成就，為歷史上之偉人。由是觀之，法氏尙有可以向人領敎之便利，而愛氏並此亦無之，全恃個人之奮鬥，遂得有志竟成。嘗見美國有小雜貨店之商人，於暇時研究昆蟲，成為有名之昆蟲專家，著述等身。花園之園丁成為植物專家，後竟充任大學敎授。博物館中之僕役成為地質學古生物學專家，後竟為該館之高等技師。化學室之僕役成為化學專家，後任大學敎授。此類之佳話不可勝數。歐美各國受科學之賜，其國內之大學及研究所固甚有功，而其窮苦靑年由下層而奮鬥為助，亦實大也。吾國淸寒子弟，今日方主張自學，其勿因環境困難，對於科學而趦趄哉！</p>
<h3 id="c97">鋁的用途增加 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 顧華保</p>
<p>據一九三七年金屬產額的統計，鋁的產額比其他金屬增加頗多，表示鋁的用途是在迅速地增加。</p>
<p>據該統計，從一九二四年到一九三七年，鋁和鎳的產額各增加三倍，金的產額增加二倍。其他金屬產額的增加比較少得多：銅增加百分之74，鋅百分之66　，錫百分之47，鐵百分之42　，鋁百分之33，銀只增加百分之6。</p>
<p>在歐戰以前，鋁的產額，就重量計算，在金屬中居第六位，但到了一九三七年却昇至第五位，若就體積計算，要昇至第四位，因為鋁的重量很小。一百噸鋁的體積，和下述各種噸數之金屬的體積相等：266噸鋅，270噸錫，290噸鐵，327噸鎳，330噸銅，389噸銀，419噸鉛，714噸金。</p>
<p>就重量計算，一九一三年所產的鋁，為當年所產鐵的百萬分之825，一九二四年所產的鋁，為當年所產鐵的百萬分之2，486；一九三七年所產的，為百萬分之5，236。</p>
<p>若就體積計算，更能顯出鋁的產額增加。一九一三年所產的鋁，為當年所產鐵百萬分之2，400，一九二四年所產的，為鐵的百萬分之7，230一九三七年為百萬分之152，30。</p>
<p>若就鋁和鉛的體積作一比較，則在一九一三年所產的鋁，為當年所產鉛的百萬分之230，800；但到了一九三七年鋁的產額却超過了所產的鉛量，即為鉛的百萬分之1．232，000。</p>
<p>就鋁和銀的體積作一比較，一九一三年所產的鋁，為當年所產銀的39倍；一九二四年所產的鋁，為當年所產銀的89倍；到了一九三七年，鋁竟為銀的251倍。</p>
<h3 id="c98">一見相識 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 禾山</p>
<p>毛蠅（Botgly）為馬害，以其蠕蟲寄生於馬之胃腸中使馬受種種病痛：如擾亂其胃之功用，使消化發生阻礙；吸收食料中之養分，使馬不能得充分之營養；阻障胃之幽門，使胃與小腸之交通為之梗塞；及蠕蟲入於大腸直腸之中，刺激腸皮，使馬感覺苦惱是也。此蠅將其卵纍於馬之毛上，恒在馬之前腿及胸部，同時有一種液體以黏膠之。馬以舌舐該處，卵緣舌入口，復輾轉入於胄。經過十日左右，則孵化為蠕蟲，遂發生以上所言之病害。此蠅之本能，專擇相當之寄主，故其卵不纍於驢騾牛羊等之身上，而必求馬之所在始行纍寄，對於馬若相識甚審者焉。馬受其痛苦，畏之頗甚，見尋常之馬蠅（Horsefly）則不畏懼，不過搖首擺尾，以揮去之，而一見此毛蠅則驚懼異常，往往方在牧塲食草，忽狂奔疾竄，入農樹灌木中以避之，其認識此蠅若有昆蟲學之知識者然。動物本能之顯著，即此可見一斑。</p>

<h3 id="c100">感光高射砲彈 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 泰公</p>
<p>據美國新近所獲得的情報，瑞典正在製造一種高射砲彈，裏面有一個光電管，能在砲彈衝過它的目標物時，使砲彈自動地爆炸。要摧毀一架轟炸機，或使它失去戰鬥力，只消這砲彈飛近它，就可達到目的。這可說是空襲者的新威脅。</p>
<p>這砲彈在飛行時，彈內的一盞電燈從彈頭裏的許多孔中發出强烈的光綫。這些光綫射着飛機的身體時，即反射到砲彈底部裹的類似孔中，被稜鏡和透鏡集中在一個光電管上。於是這管所發生的電流，便激動一個替續器，連通一個電路，而使起爆藥爆發。此藥爆發，便使主要的猛烈炸藥T．N．T．發生爆炸——此時正是爆裂的砲彈能做最大破壞工作的時刻。</p>
<p>這種砲彈因為有一種巧妙的機構，故除可在黑夜應用，又可在白天應用。它的電路適宜地調整着，祇感應迅速斷續的閃光，如它自己在飛行中旋轉時所發的斷續光。所以，祇有它自己所發出，而從飛機反射的光可以使它爆發，日光或燈光却不能。倘使它失去目標而不能爆發，則在下降時，即由一個副火綫使它爆發。</p>
<p>高射砲所發的光，從敵機反射到彈內，使砲彈爆炸。</p>

<h3 id="c101">嗜好 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>提起這兩個字就令人聯想到雅片姻與麻將牌。然而此地並不討論這些。我但願將嗜好品的定義說一說，及舉出一種人人所必需而為諸位一時所猜想不到的嗜好品，以證明嗜好與人生之重要關係而已。</p>
<p>嗜好品的定義有廣狹之分。廣義的為：凡能使精神興奮或享受愉怏之趣者皆是也；狹義的為：凡能使食慾增進而有助於消化者皆是也。例如烟，酒，茶，等等屬於廣義的，而一切做菜所用的醬，醋，薑，葱，椒，辣椒，等等乃屬於狹義的。雖然如此分法，但是嚴格的界限是沒有的。嗜好的特色為易染難除。我還記得當年某敎授嗜姻而惡酒，列舉酒害極詳，同時另一敎授嗜酒而惡烟，列舉烟害極詳，可是聽講的許多同學，並不因此而姻酒莫入，却成了烟酒全材，靑出於藍，人人之深如此。</p>
<p>人們往往以為嗜好是可有可無的東西，這倒未必盡然。我現在舉出一種人人所不能少的嗜好品，這就是我們所吃的鹽。學過生物或生理的也許要說，鹽是搆成細胞的必要成份，如何能與烟酒薑葱並列而稱之為嗜好品呢。對呀，鹽是搆成細胞的必要成份，所以植物體內及動物體內都有鹽，我們所吃的食物不外來自植物界與動物界，那麼，我們同時已把鹽吃了進去。試問這吃進去的鹽——即食物中所固有而並非額外加入的——是否已够應用呢？照事實講可說已够用的了。不見牛羊吃草，牧童未曾預先在草上加鹽嗎（新式牧塲有加鹽於草的）？虎狼逐兎，更沒有這樣大胆的閒漢，去担任撒鹽於兎背的工作。牠們都不感到鹽荒，這就證明食物中固有的鹽量已够用了。也許有人說，我們人類是兩樣的。幸而癆病治療中有淡食一法，食物在泡製時不許加鹽，同樣的證明了這件事實。現在可以總結的說，食物中所固有的鹽，乃吾人應用所必需，不得稱為嗜好品，至於厨房中做湯做菜所用的鹽，都是外加的鹽，其作用不外改良食物之味，增進食慾而帮助消化，那就是嗜好品了。普通我們所說的鹽，當然專指外加的鹽，這是最普遍的嗜好品。從個人方面觀察，則三日無鹽，皇皇如也；從社會方面觀察，则歷代鹽政，兩淮鹽運，眞够複雜的了。我們再也不能小看了嗜好品。</p>
<p>假使我們居然做了無懷葛天之民，回到茹毛飲血之俗，不管有的人引為無上快樂，有的人視作十分沈悶，但是漸漸的就會有了杜康，有了劉伶，有了印第安人，有了哥侖布氏，漸漸的又是外國人义麻將，中國人打撲克，這是人類的拿手好戲；所謂萬物之鹽，難道這就是靈的一端嗎？</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開某金號即喊二千〇七十二元買進、但售者須七十五元方肯供給、雙方直檳持至十時光景方見做開、首由某金號進錢兌業五十兩、二千〇七十三元為開盤價、較之前收做高四元、開後相同價又進銀樓帮金號各五十兩、繼之再進錢兌業一百五十兩、價仍相同、逾刻許後又進錢兌業五十兩、價亦七十三元、嗣後因售者難找、某金號遂向某錢兌業門市力進三百五十兩、最高價為七十四元五角、（聞均代港帮搜購）、此後塲中供求均稀、致難做開、延至午收價仍作七十三元、午後首由某金號吸進錢兌業五十兩、價七十二元、繼之錢兌業互做五十兩、價七十二元半、後某金號又進錢兌業五十兩、價七十三元、此後某金號限價七十三元仍想吸購、奈賣方均止售觀望、延至晚收時未見做開、故晚收仍為二千○七十三元、結果較之前收軋漲四元、全天僅一元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千○八十元、收進二千○七十元、現標金照掛脾金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤鮮少變動、大同行仍懸原價二百十元、新同行為二百○八元、收進二百○二元、</p>
<p>英純金又縮一便士</p>
<p>三日倫敦電、英純金因歐局稍有緩和、且英鎊潛勢良好、故多戶續來吐售、致每盎司又縮一辦士、計退達七鎊八先令五辦士、中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦降落至一千二百十一元六角、掛牌海關金亦低二厘、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準金價亦隨跌七角、計一千二百○六元九角、</p>

<h3 id="c126">法西斯國的沒落 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>國際間最近的幾事件，很可以看出法西斯的沒落來。</p>
<p>較先進的義大利。她對法國的要求，雖然已經大打折扣，不提打領土的割讓，只希望一些蘇　士運河和吉布底港口的交通便利，以及法屬都尼西亞的義橋改良待遇，而法國所答覆的是；不割尺寸土地，不與絲毫權利。她無奈之何，到現在還沒有看到她有什麼作為。</p>
<p>其次是德國。十多天以前，在中歐狼奔　突，頗有席捲所有弱小之勢，等到英國宣言保障波蘭，不許侵略之後，她不得不廢然而返，將但澤得要求擱起。她得負責者雖然也發表了一篇演說，以爲自己解嘲，可是播音中斷，慌亂可見，而字裏行間，誠如倫敦人士所謂；（希特勒使吾人恍惚，但未使吾人益見困擾，）其效力也就可想而知。然而這不是希特勒得故弄玄虛，實在也是無可奈何！</p>
<p>最後是日本。她爲了對蘇聯得漁業問題，會一再劍拔弩張，表示決不讓步。現在，臨時漁業協定到底成立了，而她們多得的是：租費提高百分之十；二十七處重要得漁場，由蘇聯收回；參加她所反對得聲聲拍賣。</p>
<p>她們，這些法西斯國，為什麼會這樣前侷而後恭呢？已有所得，感到　足？存心悔禍，不爲已甚？確有其見，維持世界和平？不，不，都不是得！這是她們　到了真正的堅　，不得不然。</p>
<p>她們一貫得作風是虛聲　嚇，挑撥離間。往常她們的得以優哉游哉，自得其樂，就因為各民治國沒有摸清她們的脾氣，或者摸准了沒有堅決的表示，聯合的行動，所以她們得以胡作妄為，逐其貪欲，現在各民治國大徹大悟，幡然改　起來，她們的　　之技，自然只好告窮。</p>
<p>前事不忘，后事之師。假使各民治國　能本此精神，嘉賓擦背到底，她們，法西斯國，最後的沒落，是必然不可必然避免的！</p>
<p>中國抗戰二十一個月，也就是這種不怕威脅，不受離間的精神的表現。所以對我們存有大慾的敵人，法西斯國之一，也終必有達到最沒落之一日！</p>
<h3 id="c127">叛逆的兒女 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 紫金</p>
<p>當我還沒出國的時候，在上海，總時常看到XX大學裏內一羣來自榴連的國土的「黑大漢」，習性彪悍，豪華無度，腦子又簡單到只懂得錢，汽車，洋房，蘇州得女人……事無，大，小，黑，白，一律都用「粗拳」解決；個個都像是法國路易士。　列普所刻畫得那個　名　「葡萄」得穆里司，三句不對，眼睛瞪得圓圓地，一下子準就：</p>
<p>「媽得！」大窩兒蜂擁上前，「打！」</p>
<p>在酒樓上,在急管繁絃得無塲裏，她們時常這樣得使酒鬥氣，爲了「海運」大演　戰「特洛伊城」。或者教授得「學分」不給連融，抽出小刀威嚇也沒甚希奇。像這樣，這班「黑大漢」給予人們的印象當然很糟，甚至有許多人以為：凡是生長在赤道上的，都是這一型的「獨兒」，說得不好聽些，那便是：變東西！然而這是個不小的錯誤，就同一班學者斷章取義地讚揚莎士比亞一樣地錯誤，如其一個人到過赤道上，獲得了他們所生的「總印象」，之後，他使會如此地感覺到了。</p>
<p>赤道上是炎熱的，香草永遠是碧油油的，陽光長年火樣地燒　著。而赤道上的中華兒女們，也是那麼熱情，那麼像火似燒　著：率真，勇武，激昂挺進。幫暴敵權兵，中國像巨人樣地　　起來捍　的時候，他們和她們的這種力量，便發揮得更猛，更大，一片暗　　　　，　澈了整個赤道上：「為了國家」，他們對於那一班赦於飛機大炮得恐X病患　得唬嚇唔，一刀兩斷：「怕島！」</p>
<p>語言即是他們和她們的行動。從緬甸，從　　，從英屬馬來半島，從荷蘭的藩土上.....,後備車一陣地流向苦難的中國。在抗X軍政大學和陜北公學，在救護隊裏，在黃塵漫漫的疆場上，那個地方沒有他們和她們的蹤跡？英國詩人白朗　的這舉行詩歌，赤道上的中華兒女們是永遠值得引為夸耀的：「我永遠是戰士，以寡敵眾，奮鬥到死。」還世上，黑暗的魔鬼扇起翅膀，到處都在　　著。在J地就會經發生過一件「離奇百出」的事：一位中學女生，誓志從戎，背了父母，和兩個志同道合的「黑大漢」乘輪返國。當輪船到了　　的時候，　給她的令親打電報囑海關連同男的一起扣留了起來，接著便押送回家。一班「　　　　」的封建餘孽，穿上道袍，粉墨登場，都幫同著作祟了：「拐誘私逃，不行！控告！」報館裏那班「無冤帝王」也像煞有介事的，在報章上大書特書：「世風不古冒名從軍，誘女私奔！」</p>
<p>之後，不知怎麼一來，那兩個「黑大漢」很僥倖的不受「控告」而又自由返國：但那位中學女生，　給她的令親監鎖起來了，就像希臘神話中的女郎普賽克被　娜絲幽囚在孤寂的塔中一樣，不能自主的跑動一步。即使他們的女兒　　在　　中日久馴成了神女賦裏所說的「即　　於幽靜兮，父婆婆乎人間」的那種女性，在這時代裏不知又有甚麼用？這　是個疑問。做父母的本來給兒女當「墊腳石」的老年人把他們的她們當做一　亂飛亂攢的小毛蟲，仰天太息了：「小毛蟲，怕不　XX人　給這些小毛蟲活活打死？唉！叛徒的兒女呀！」</p>
<p>然而事實　不然，XX人　給這些小毛蟲活活叮死了！</p>
<p>赤道上的叛徒的兒女們，是中國國力底另一行來源！</p>

<p>「起來！不愿做努力的人們……」</p>
<p>歌聲，旗子，給甜美的春風蕩樣著前進。溫和的陽光照著正在岸上走著的我們-一小隊，彎彎曲曲，隨著　陌前進！</p>
<p>我們雖然出發了四天，但我們工作權不偷閒，團結的精神，越來得堅固。一個個給陽光照得黑黑的面孔，顯出一雙愣愣的眼睛。三位女同志比我們更勇敢，沿途分發著救亡的傳單，唱著「婦女進行曲」，使正在忙著的農婦，停了農作頃　著那甜美的歌聲。</p>
<p>快近海邊了，望見隔岸（海山）的大概。我們快樂起來，同時肚子　也在鳴　著想起今夜要回到海上　演話劇；又想哪裡公所會經熱烈歡迎的情形，那　美的飯菜，我們一叮要盡力的出演　　。</p>
<p>「站住！在這小屋前作此地最末一次表演。」校長嚴肅的臉孔對著我們，又指著拿旗子的我，意思是　我準備著。大家　分別的工作起來：化妝拉，借桌椅啦，敲鑼敲鼓啦，忙了一會。村內的男女老幼都來了，圍成一個圓形。小孩子們笑哈哈的等待著。</p>
<p>當我大略地各戰場最近戰訊後，一位女同志就開始解釋放下你的鞭子合其餘二幕短劇的劇情，使他（她）們容易了解。這樣，話劇就開始了。</p>
<p>一幕劇完了以後，我們中間還見插著演說啦，歌唱啦，個別問答啦，使他們不會覺得時間相隔太久。</p>

<p>— 曉光</p>
<p>人與社會的關係是建　在互助同情上的，我很和信這一句話；但，有許多耳聞目睹的事實，又使我懷疑這句名言。</p>
<p>如：在路上有人跌了一交，兩旁的人看見了會拍手大笑。鄉里人初到都市，走不慣馬路被汽車車夫撞到，險些兒送命；但汽車夫不會停住了車去把他扶起來，反而會大大地罵他「屈死！」</p>
<p>一個小　三站在馬路旁捉白虱，人們會　一道鄙夷的目光給他。一歌殘廢者，沒有了腳，跑起路來，靠兩隻手艱難地爬，人們見了不覺得慘，反而會引起一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>強盜和賊，大家都覺得可惡，大家都會　罵他們。其實，賊和強盜的本質未必定是壞的，還不是整個社會制度的不良，而造成他們的不良？況且無論如何，他們的行為總比出賣民族利益的漢奸，高超得多。</p>
<p>人類應當有熱情，有同情互助的「心」，除去對於真正「要不得」得以為。</p>
<p>今日的中國人，每一個該拿出偉大的同情心來，不過，無疑地，這同情心是有這正義感的。因為優人之優樂人之樂的心是可取的，　不能給予敵人，來助長他們的兇焰，否則正義要在世界上減種樂。</p>
<h3 id="c132">抗戰與詩歌 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 序亭</p>
<p>為什麼三國以後的詩歌，會在文壇特殊的發達呢？也許為了天下大亂，文士作家都戎馬疆塲，或是顛沛流離的緣故，再也沒有大功夫埋頭書桌來作幾篇較長的文字。然而，雖在那混亂的時代，人的　情水不失去，反更特殊的增長，更充滿悲壯慷慨的熱情和　纏綿　　的哀情。於是這短小　　　感情的詩歌便大大的被利用，被發展了。現在，全國抗戰；大時代被開展了。文壇正鬧著「為什麼還沒有偉大的作品呢」的問題；我倒不以爲然，我以為，這該是偉大詩歌創作的時代。</p>
<p>據某副刊的編輯說：凡文藝刊物收到的稿件，詩歌占極大的數目，也就是這個道理；但是每一份刊物（當然除了詩歌刊物）都束於詩歌占全稿八份之一的方式，作家也囚了加以拘束，詩歌便無法擴展了。這也就是現代的詩歌不似三國那時發達的原因。</p>
<p>我們知道，詩歌並不比其他文藝來得更壞；反比其他更寫作便利，更有感情得力量。在我國作家，現在自然像三國時代得文士一樣，戎馬疆場或顛沛流離，即使暫時坐定也困於　　文的格式，向敵人，漢奸以及一切腐敗分子作猛烈的攻擊，或是正通俗地向大眾解釋抗戰的意義。所以，雖則有著良好的題材，但沒有餘假的時間，從事偉大文藝的創作。然而詩歌的創作依然沒有妨礙；短小的體裁　富於感情的表現。假使這些刊物能打破八一的方式，詩歌無疑地會飛　進展的。</p>
<p>歌詠大時代的偉　，就在這時吧！</p>

<p>— 幸人</p>
<p>大隊的電影藝人們，前歲在抗戰軍以後，同於「上海影人劇團」組織之下，　挾往時銀幕聲威，長征入川，表演救亡戲劇。當下在重慶成都各地，會熱烈轟動，受及觀眾們的盛大歡迎；同時在救亡工作方面，也正是一個具有絕大效能的有力宣傳。他們在成都一地，時期上客居最久；直到現在還有很多人在作長期公演。　光，他們在初到哪裏的時候，當地許多青年士女，對這一大　時代艦隊的人物，都爲亦步亦　，事事仿效；尤其關於服飾方面，更會鬧初了不少趣話。</p>
<p>赤足革履</p>
<p>白楊劉莉影等一般女明星，那時因值秋熱未退，很多人都還露出具有誘惑力的玉　，赤足革履,不着襪子。重慶的娘兒們爲赤眼界新開，紛紛脫　不　，競夸時髦。甚且效而尤之，有些穿著普通的鞋子的時代女性，也都不著襪子，居然迅捷的形成了一時風尚。</p>
<p>絨球帽子</p>
<p>一種兒童式的頂上　有大　球的　帽子，有些男演員們原於客邸中用作　帽的。一天，有人演戲下場，偶然戴著這帽子到劇場裏去跑上幾次，許多青年觀眾以為它是上海新流行的式子；不上幾天功夫，成都市上，便見爭起效尤，風行一時；馬路上熙來　往的青年們，大家這樣戴上一頂，帽色紅綠深淺，各類俱備，蔚爲奇觀。全市帽子店裏亦多趕　應市，每頂售價昂至二三元，尚屬供不應求，真是一筆額外的大好生意。</p>
<p>緞帶束髪</p>
<p>白楊有一次上照相館去拍照，她爲沒有怎樣新的裝束，一時忽動妙思，將所服绒線外衣上的一條腰帶解了下來，　在頭上權充缎帶。帶子兩端的大绒毬那樣斜　髪角，模樣兒也很見別緻。後來，照相館把這照片陳列在當街玻璃廚中，頓時引起眾女流屬目，爭爲大家忙著照式打扮起來，又即成為了一種很流行的新　花樣更可發笑的事事施超的「內子」卓曼麗，她爲求將大衣帶去，入冬天氣　寒，身上還仍穿著單薄的旗袍。施超一時無奈，因將自己一襲上裝給她穿上暫以禦寒。不想當地女娘們一經發現，竟又認為也是很新式的時髦服裝，都在紛紛盲從，而不讓卓曼麗一人專美了</p>
<p>旗袍外穿</p>
<p>諸如此類的笑話，在容　兩地，委實鬧得不少，發　之至。就此一點看來，那些電影藝人表演救亡劇得宣偉力，這也正是一個明顯得反證。</p>

<p>這裏幾張片子，都是好萊塢最近得新片。有幾部是很有價值得，已經在美國各地公映了，不知道大到了上海之後又是要加價嗎？因為中文得譯名沒有，只得把原文抄錄如下：</p>
<p>（一）“Ice　Follies　of　1939”這是瓊克勞馥的一張簇新的片子，她有著很美麗的滑冰的姿態演出。配演者有詹姆士斯蒂華，劉亞里斯，李易斯東等；這是一張米高梅的出品。</p>
<p>（二）幾年大約是詹姆士斯蒂華打出風頭的一年，你看他又和卡洛朗白合演“Made　for　Each　other”。這是一張愛情片，有著歌唱作為背景。</p>
<p>（三）秀蘭鄧波兒的新作是一張五彩片，“Litlie　Prineess”,據說演技之佳超過所攝之各片，而且有着極偉大的軍事場面。配演的是李卻格林，愛妮太露薏絲，西柴羅密歐等</p>
<p>（四）在銀幕上以哀艷細膩的演技著名者蓓蒂台薇絲和喬治勃朗，亨弗萊鮑茄合演，“Dark　Victory”。據華納當局說，蓓蒂爲了要飾演這張片子的主角，有等待了八年之久，這一角色完全適合她的個性，演來當然十分精彩。</p>
<p>（五）克拉克蓋博和瑙瑪希拉兩人從未搭檔，但現在要在“Idiot's　Delight”這片子中演出了；並且演技都是十分精湛的。這又是一張米高梅的出品。</p>
<p>（六）去年出過一時風頭的亨利方達，現在又和瑪琳沃莎莉文合演“Let　Usa　Live　”了。亨利飾:個馬車夫，是和瑪琳談戀愛情的一段故事。有離奇的情節，仿佛偵探片子。</p>
<p>（七）琴派克的　　，明朗的演出，又將一顯身手“Romance　of　the　Redwoods”中，和卻爾斯　克福，高登　利　等合演。這是完全以愛情作主題的一張片子，哥倫比亞出品。</p>
<p>（八）繼「孤兒樂園」之後，密　羅納又有一張新片“HnckleberryFinn”，和他配合的有威　凡來，華脫哥納等。</p>
<p>（九）愛淋　和卻爾斯　　，這兩個從未配合過的明星，將有一張哀感，　　的巨片拍出來了，那像是“Lovo　Affair”。這是一張雷電華公司的出品。</p>
<p>（十）在西席地密爾（這拍攝戰爭場面的大導演）的領導下，喬麥克和白蓓蘭史　　有一張以印度戰爭作!!的偉大影片出現了，片名“Pacific's　Union”。兩仁有　前的演出。</p>
<p>（十一）保羅茂尼又有新的作品了，也史以張歷史故事，和蓓蒂台維絲合演。片中，保羅　一皇帝，蓓蒂　一女皇；兩人都有極佳的演出；而保羅茂尼的化妝尤爲成功。這是一張二十世紀福斯的出品。</p>
<p>（十二）泰　　華，亨利方達，南賽凱萊三大明星　合演的“Jesse　james”算是今年十大巨片之一。這故事是敘述美國一個著名強盜生平。泰隆飽華目「忠義雙全」，以及最近的「　伊士」之後，已經爲好萊塢巨星了；在這張片子中將有十分精湛的演出。　　凱萊是好萊塢的新女星，芳齡十七，現爲二十世紀福斯基本演員，在今年的銀　上，她將放一　彩了。在本片中　泰隆之妻</p>

<h3 id="c142">『掃墓』與『掃魔』 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 熾強</p>
<p>節屆清明，轉瞬又是借香花燭奠來寄懷祖先的掃墓時候到了。</p>
<p>掃墓的清明時節，雖然有到臨的一天，而我們的廬墓呢？讀「緇衣莫起風塵嘆，猶及清明可到家」之句，不禁潸然！</p>
<p>我們的廬墓呢？墓，或已圯了，或已成為廠墟了！窮兵黷武者的魔影幢幢，張牙舞爪，奪去我們的良田，焚毀我們的廬舍，奸淫殺掠我們的同胞，或竟造成一個廣大的填塋，來活埋我中國，坑殺我四萬萬五千萬同胞。</p>
<p>我們的身邊，大概都有一個「自己的填墓」了。這填墓是敵人造成的，難道我們就走進去不成嗎？然而我心滋痛！如果用感傷的語調來說，當然是：「我生不辰，丁斯危局」了！然而，感傷是不必的，「危局」雖然給我們「丁斯」，而「我生」實在非常「當今」；用當今的「我生」，拯救「丁斯」的「危局」，則敵人雖然儘量的廣造填塋，將必不能拔出他們自己那些泥腳，至少也是聊以寄存他們自己那些一包包的「骨灰」而已。</p>
<p>基於以上的意義，則目前清明節，對於祖先的「墓」，似乎可以不必去「掃」，就是魂髣髴而來享的「遙祭」或「遙掃」，以及「領衛代表」式的「寄香」與「寄奠」等類，也都可以不必。如果說祖先真正在天有靈的話，那末際此「邦崩離析」的當兒，至少也應明白子孫抗敵救亡的艱苦，以至於眾生所度著的一切苦厄，是怎樣一種嚴重而危急的症候。豈願自己的子孫分心於「香花燭奠，邀弔噓唏」而懈怠其為國宣勞的力量以貽「親者痛，仇者快」嗎？</p>
<p>不掃祖先之墓，祖先決不會「殭屍作崇」。不掃「自己的填墓」，則魅魑魍魎變本加勵施弄其伎倆以侵害我們。在這個魔鬼幢幢的陰暗間，如果再不爭取把自己奪回來，則身其餘幾？</p>
<p>因為這樣，對於各人「自己的填墓」，不能不痛切的自我檢討一番，而且要把人家那座給我們造下來的填墓也設法搬開，設法掃蕩個空。</p>
<p>最近蔣委員長夫人宋美齡女士，曾著有「七種著名的痼疾」一文，所謂痼疾，據她說：（一）派別觀念，（二）缺乏自制能力，（三）逃避责任，（四）自暴自弃，（五）差不多，（六）忌嫉，（七）偏狭等。最後她願意全民族四萬萬五千萬同胞人人發出「我將再生」的堅決呼聲，以此聲音演成力量，喚起行動，造成我們「中華民族的復興」。</p>
<p>「七種著名的痼疾」，就是七個著名的病魔作祟於各該身體間而時時有建築各該「自己的填墓」的可能，如果不設法給它掃蕩個一幹二淨，非但無以對遙遠的祖先，也決不能繼續生長自己。而且四周圍窺伺動靜的外來魔鬼，更要利用這些內在的魔鬼不住糾纏的機會，來張牙舞爪，生吞活剝，速我們於死亡，置我們於萬劫不復的絕地。則「自己的填墓」，尚且不暇掃，又何暇掃及先民之墓乎？</p>
<p>況且「吾人今日行孝的對象，應為整個之民族，應求不負吾民族共同之祖先，吾人應時刻自念吾數百代共同甘共苦祖先所創辛苦經營而遺留於吾人之錦繡河山。——」</p>
<p>現在錦繡河山，有許多焦了，則我們的改「掃墓」為「掃魔」，實為當前急不容緩的要著。流離失所的人們，假如你們還不忘記祖先辛苦經營而遺留給我們的錦繡河山的話！假如你們還要「我將再生」的話！</p>
<h3 id="c143">公所會館 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>往年到了清明的時節，我們在報紙上會看到各公所或各會館「催柩回籍」的廣告，但今年是例外，不看見了。本來在「孤島」的上海，你就是想把棺柩運回去，也是很麻煩的。</p>
<p>公所和會館，事實上是二位一體的，如果一定要分出界限，那公所是辦理便利同鄉的慈善事業，而會館是專作停柩之用的。在職權上，也是立體而不是平面的，因為會館是屬於公所管理。</p>
<p>原初，當然先有公所，後有會館，而大半公所和會館是在一起的。因此，直到現在，在名稱上，有許多人還是不分界限。公所是有些像外國的基爾特Gnild，所謂「同業公會」，大概在通商以後，上海是迅速的繁榮起來，各地來滬的商人，工友，為謀同鄉或同行的福利起見，便捐些錢，組織了同業公會同樣性質的公所。</p>
<p>一般的公所，當初把所募集的捐款，購置了地産，那時就是租界上面，也到處荒地，還沒有現在的繁榮，所以地價很便宜。但後來馬路逐年展長，市況日見繁榮，地價是漲得驚人，公所購置的地産，值價也就千百倍於所出的原價。這樣一來，有許多公所，便成了有錢的社團機關，有的更在所置的空地上，造了房屋，租給人家，以所得的房租再去投資地産，使産業日增，那就在主管的董事長袖善舞了。</p>
<p>本來會館是屬於公所的一部，併在一起的，但後來租界上面，人口逐年增加，在鬧市之中，停了好多棺柩，影響衛生，為都市當局所不滿，加着地價又漲得那麽高，把高貴的地産當做停棺柩之用，有些可惜。於是一般的公所。便另外在南市，閘北，購置地産，造起殯舍來，使會館和公所分立，而原初會館所讓出的房屋，土地，也就可作別類用途了。</p>
<p>從此公所就好像是專重行政，專辦施醫，施藥，救濟同鄉，設立學校的地方，人家死了人，先到公所裏去接洽了，照章付費之後，便可把棺柩抬到會館裏去暫厝。的確，住在上海的人們，家裏死了人，棺柩不能馬上送回原籍，這問題祇有會館來替你解決。</p>
<p>死了人，把棺柩寄在會館裏面，停柩的地方，也有上中下三等。一口棺材停一間的呌「大獨間」，「小獨間」，三五個合停一間的呌「拼間」，好多棺材停一起的呌「統間」，而所付的寄費每年自四五元起，到一二百元止，不過，同鄉可享照章對折收費的優待。滿了一年，不去付費，那到了清明，便會替你運到原籍的義塚地去埋葬。</p>
<p>會館既大半在南市閘北，上海發生了戰事，因為交通的不便當，結果又使若幹公所，重新在租界上把一部分房屋讓出來，專作停柩之用，寄費自然特別高，也含有些投機作用。同時，殯儀館，寄材所之類，也就為了會館的在封鎖狀態之下，不斷的在滬西發現，成立了一種新興事業，專供喪家的寄柩。</p>

<p>第七回　乳燕新鶯影聯雙璧　越羅吳錦機織七襄</p>
<p>何家兩位小姐的電報，到北平去後，不到三天，便接着何先生的快信了。信中說：「他在北平，也有好幾天耽擱。就是以貨易貨，用我國的茶葉，與蘇聯交換火油的契約，也簽字發表了，想你們在報紙上，也已見過。此外還有好幾件國際貿易事件，都在進行接洽中。便是東三省的大豆，我們和德國，也想仿照這個與蘇聯以貨易貨的辦法，交換他們的機械和顔料。因此我必須到東三省去一行。」信中又說：「從前你們姊妹兩人，有在江浙兩省，創辦紡織廠的意思。一向我們也沒有細細討論過。此刻在北平，遇到兩位江浙間的朋友和他們談論過，他們都非常高興。他們主張先辦織綢廠，可以做國外貿易生意。據他們說：歐美人很喜歡中國的絲織品，以前歐美的巨船到了上海，一定要買許多中國的綢緞紗羅去。他們說：中國的絲織品，比了日本的好得多，他們都願意購中國貨。可惜中國的絲織物商人，墨守舊法，不思改進，只銷國內，不願做洋裝生意。現在他們很有志於此，可惜沒有那種紡織專門人材。我曾約略提及你們兩人，在美國學的是紡織，他們聽了，高興極了。至於資本，倒不愁，用他們說可以湊集一百萬元，教我擔任十分之二。這都不成問題，不過你們高興辦吧？我常聽你們說：回國以後，必定要有一個職業。但職業必定要你們所樂於擔任，視有把握的。若是所用非所學，這就沒有意思了。回想以前，吾國的生絲出口，一蹶不振。我們在美國時，調查他們所用的生絲，從日本來的，倒占了百分之七十。其餘百分之三十，我國與法意兩國都有一些供給。可憐我國，本來銷到美國占第一位的，跌到如此。到後來，日本專事侵略，人民都出去當了兵，養蠶的人也逐漸少了。再加以各國抵制日貨，不用日本的生絲，美國的女學生，連絲襪都不願意穿。日本的生絲，連年的慘跌，跌到現在，美國所用的生絲日本僅占百分之二十五，而我國銷到美國去的生絲，已跳到了百分之六十五。這算是我們生絲出口的恢復力了，但我們不但是生貨，熟貨也要努力。」（七九）</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Zhongshan Telephone: Over 1,000 Japanese troops transferred from Guangzhou boarded shallow-water vessels to reinforce Jiangmen. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops in the suburbs. The main force landed from North Street, advancing under naval cover. Japanese planes also heavily bombed Jiangmen. By 6:00 PM, Jiangmen had fallen again. Fierce fighting continued in the direction of Xinhui City. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese warships are gathering near the coastal areas of Southern Guangdong, between Weizhou Island and Beihai, seemingly preparing to expand their incursions into areas like Qinlian. There have been no major changes in the Qiongyai war situation. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The battle situation in the Gao'an area is intensifying. Japanese troops appear to be using their main force to advance along the Gan-Xiang Highway toward a certain Chinese army. The Japanese forces on the front consist of two regiments with 40 tanks. On the 2nd, a small part had already passed the northern end of Gao'an City and engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops. In the Majiashan area northwest of Wuning, there are two Japanese regiments. A certain Chinese unit's counter-offensive has been successful and has now reached a certain location south of Wuning. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: Approximately 1,000 more Japanese troops have been added to the forces in Shaping. Chinese troops are still facing off against the Japanese in the areas east of [illegible]. Japanese Battalion Commander, Shisong, and Company Commander, Jinsong, were both killed in the Shaping battle. Shisong's unit has suffered casualties amounting to 70%. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Chinese army's counter-offensive in Hubei has been successful. Zhongxiang, located 180 kilometers northwest of Hankou on the east bank of the Hanshui River, has been completely surrounded by Chinese troops. After fierce bloody battles in the suburbs, Chinese troops broke through the Japanese defense line, occupied the docks, and the Japanese retreated into the city, tightly closing the city gates and holding fast. The Chinese army first launched a heavy artillery bombardment, and then this morning stormed through the city gates, leading to intense street fighting. (4th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui: The fighting in the vicinity of Xinhui County seat took an abrupt turn for the worse on the afternoon of the 3rd. Chinese troops repeatedly charged and killed many Japanese soldiers. However, due to rapid Japanese reinforcements, the defending troops of the city were heavily surrounded. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Japanese plainclothes troops rushed into the city. After fierce street fighting with Chinese troops, they withdrew to the suburbs. Xinhui County seat then fell into Japanese hands. Chinese reinforcements are now heading to [illegible] and [illegible] areas, occupying strategic positions and fortifying defenses. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The focus of the war remains in southern China and northern Jiangxi. Japanese troops are still urgently invading southward in Jiangxi. Approximately two Japanese regiments invading Gao'an are in a bloody battle with Chinese troops along the line of Shilidui, Qilishang, and Taojiazhuang near the north of the city. Japanese troops advancing toward Jinxian were blocked by Chinese troops in the mountainous areas northwest of the county. Chinese armies continue to advance, and will attack the Japanese on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line. The number of Japanese warships in eastern Zhejiang has increased, posing a threat of invading to coordinate with Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi. Chinese authorities have ordered strict defense. (4th Morning Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: After suffering setbacks from their western advance, the Japanese troops occupying Wuning are now mostly moving south towards Dongkou and Luoping. They may connect with the Japanese troops in Jing'an and Anyi. Chinese troops in the western suburbs of Wuning also frequently launch counterattacks against the Japanese troops in Wuning from an overlooking position. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: On the evening of the 1st, Japanese troops continuing their advance toward Xinhui launched a fierce attack on Chinese troops in the Douniushan area (approximately 4 kilometers northeast of Xinhui City). After several charges by Chinese troops, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Chinese troops are currently holding their original positions. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: After several strong resistance efforts by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops in Shaping suffered hundreds of casualties. On the 1st, they received reinforcements of over 1,000 men and are now facing off against Chinese troops in the Jingangxu area. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese dispatches, Chinese and Japanese troops in northwestern Jiangxi Province are currently fighting on the north bank of the Jin River (which flows east into the Gan River) west of Gao'an. Japanese troops have occupied the positions surrounding Jing'an, Fengxin, and Anyi. Chinese troops have built trenches in the mountains west of these locations to hold them. Furthermore, Chinese troops on the west bank of the Hanshui River in central Hubei, opposite Zhongxiang, crossed the river on April 2nd. That evening, the vanguard of the Chinese army arrived at Ximatou outside Zhongxiang. The Chinese army has now surrounded Zhongxiang. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although Japanese sources here claim that Japanese troops have entered Gao'an, according to neutral sources here, the fighting is still taking place 50 kilometers southwest of Nanchang. The claim that Japanese troops have invaded Gao'an is exaggerated. Furthermore, according to reliable information obtained by neutral sources, a large number of Chinese reinforcements recently arrived from Yuanzhou (Yichun) via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, sufficient to curb any attempted advances by the Japanese. It is also heard that in the Hengyang area of Hunan, Chinese forces have a significant number of troops stationed to prevent Japanese troops from infiltrating central Hunan. (4th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) He Guoguang, Director of the Chengdu Executive Headquarters, gave a detailed account of the current war situation during an expanded memorial week yesterday. He stated that the Japanese army's attempt to invade Yisha in central Hubei had failed. The battles of Nanchang and Wuning were fierce, and the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses. The Japanese army was intimidated by the brave resistance spirit of the Chinese army. When the Japanese army invaded a certain area of Wuning, they fiercely bombarded the Chinese army's positions with airplanes and artillery. The brave soldiers of the Chinese army fought valiantly in blood, never retreating even slightly. When the Japanese army charged into the Chinese army's position, one remaining soldier single-handedly killed dozens of Japanese soldiers with a blade before sacrificing himself. The current Japanese situation is dire, relying only on frequent troop movements (a show of force, but in reality without any ability to invade). The fall of Nanchang is irrelevant to the overall war situation. Chinese troops are now severely attacking Japanese troops in more advantageous areas. (4th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops invading Xinhui have been repelled by Chinese troops. The Japanese troops in the Shaping area have also retreated to Jiujiang. (4th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources, the war in Jiangxi Province is still centered on the Xiang-Gan Highway. The Japanese army is currently concentrating its main force, advancing southwest along this road, attempting to attack Pingxiang, an important location in western Jiangxi, and then to spy on Hengyang in the west, in order to cut off the retreat route of the Chinese army in the northern section of the Yue-Han Railway. After five days of fierce fighting, Chinese troops in Gao'an have shifted to new positions to continue resisting. The fighting has now moved to the mountainous areas southwest and northwest of Gao'an. The Japanese troops invading south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang are still being contained by Chinese troops in Yangjiazhen, northwest of Jinxian. Yesterday, the fighting there was quite intense. In the Xiushui area, there have been no changes to either side's positions. Although the Japanese army has occupied Wuning, most of the surrounding high ground is still under Chinese army control, so the Japanese army has not dared to advance west rashly.

<p>Pingjiang: On the 2nd, a reporter interviewed General [illegible] to inquire about the recent war situation in the Xinyang area. According to reports, since the Chinese army launched a general offensive against the Japanese troops occupying Xinyang on the 23rd and 24th of last month, they have repeatedly achieved victories. In addition to recovering strongholds such as Luotuo Dian on the 23rd, the Chinese troops attacking the city encountered over 800 Japanese soldiers combined of infantry, artillery, and cavalry on the 24th, engaged in fierce fighting all day, killing over 200 Japanese soldiers, and obtaining many spoils of war. The remaining Japanese troops fled back into the city and destroyed the Japanese ammunition depot. Because the Japanese army was prepared, they were unable to break through and temporarily retreated to [illegible]. On the 26th, they charged into the northwest two passes and engaged in street fighting with the enemy. The Japanese army was in a state of panic and extorted civilian clothing from residents, preparing to flee. Subsequently, for strategic reasons, they were ordered to temporarily retreat to the [illegible] line near Xinyang and confront the Japanese army, awaiting further orders to attack.

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, the Japanese newspapers have repeatedly reported that Cai Jinhua, the commander of the Chinese guerrillas who was already killed by the Japanese army, is still leading her troops to continue resisting in southern Anhui. Thus, the Japanese reports are completely refuted. Ms. Cai was very active in Taihu before, and seeing that the Japanese army was becoming increasingly tyrannical in the area, she felt filled with righteous indignation and led her subordinates, more than 500 people, to rise up. She named her troops with the two characters (Jinhua). Recently, the military authorities appointed her as the captain. Ms. Cai is good at shooting and can shoot with both hands at the same time. She is young and beautiful and has the demeanor of a man. Ms. Cai and her male and female comrades live together in camps and are not bound by etiquette. (4th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">A New Era in International Diplomacy? <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain has recently exhausted himself in the situation in Eastern Europe, with much fanfare. On the afternoon of the 3rd, during his speech in the House of Commons, he was quite proud that he had opened a new era in British diplomacy. The various parties in his country, both in and out of power, as well as politicians and journalists in its democratic allies, also unanimously praised it as the beginning of a new era. However, can it be considered a new era without feeling ashamed? We sincerely wish the old man success, and would like to say a word for the further advancement of the new era.</p>
<p>The term "diplomacy" has its normal meaning and solemn interpretation. A country does not allow diplomacy to be insulted or despised; it is a major policy of national international standing. However, due to objective confusion with abnormal states and subjective entry into detours, it has long deviated from its original purpose and lost its original appearance. For example, it is said that "diplomatic rhetoric" should be the most grand, accurate, sincere, and passionate language and text to obtain the highest trust. However, today's people almost universally regard diplomatic rhetoric as deceptive and evasive language to shirk responsibility. Those who hear it are confused and discard it, but also think that diplomatic rhetoric is inherently like this; those who speak it think that they are succeeding, that they are doing their best in rhetoric, and that since it is issued for diplomacy, it should be like this. For example, it is said that "diplomatic skills" should be acts that are reasonable, sensible, and timely, aiming to genuinely benefit both parties. However, today's people almost universally regard diplomatic skills as methods of deception and coercion, and tactics of mutual fraud. This is inherently due to dishonest intentions, but for the sake of diplomacy, fraud is not shunned; the other party is wary and only nominally yields temporarily. It is undeniable that it is a misunderstanding of diplomacy and a wrong turning if a country uses nothing but deceptive and evasive language, and mere nominal yielding, in its diplomacy. The historical facts of those who caused disaster to the people and overturned states as a result are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>The birth of the League of Nations had the strong involvement of each member state; its intentions were very real, but its consequences were extremely poor. Its covenant was almost a historical document of international deception, and its organization was almost a grand compilation of international diplomatic scams. Those in control were either cowardly in the face of danger or fundamentally insincere; those who protected it, such as China, only obtained so-called moral comfort; those who relied on it, such as Abyssinia, were reduced to slavery and had no way to appeal. Since then, when the Spanish problem occurred, there was the seemingly righteous policy of non-intervention; under this method, one could avoid disaster, avert remaining calamities, make empty protests and sit idly by while intervention occurred, and endure deception and reluctantly compromise. When the Czech problem occurred, not only was the mutual assistance treaty deemed insufficient, but the Munich Agreement was even used to aid the abuser, acting as if nothing was happening and shamelessly so. Czech Republic was neither able to seek completeness through the mutual assistance treaty nor able to survive through the Munich Agreement. Those who perished passed away, and the merit of peace was praised in appeasement. There was no war in international Europe. What corresponds to this is diplomatic rhetoric; what holds it together is diplomatic skill.</p>
<p>When Germany destroyed the Czech Republic, public opinion was in an uproar. This was not out of love for the Czech Republic, but only out of fear that disaster would befall themselves; the sympathy of "when the rabbit dies, the fox grieves" enveloped Europe. Therefore, some argued that tolerance had reached its limit, appeasement had failed, and the aggressor's ambition was boundless, so that it was clearly revealed. Moralists suddenly understood, and politicians suddenly changed their plans. If this is indeed the case, then let us research it based on widely circulated news. All of the above is still deceptive talk. Has the initial setback of Britain's proposal for an anti-aggression declaration been forgotten? Poland refused to join. What could be done? Dissatisfied with the declaration's inability to escape the pitfalls of so-called "diplomatic rhetoric" and "diplomatic skills," it was, in other words, not a grand, accurate, sincere, and passionate language, but an untrustworthy action. In plain language, Britain had not fully realized the situation, had not changed its plans, and still issued unrestricted, ineffective empty words because it was unwilling to take responsibility. The British reply to Germany stated, "Germany's neighboring countries cannot forget that Germany has repeatedly broken its promises. Therefore, they must unite and resist aggression." In fact, this kind of blame for violent aggression in a convoluted logical way, at least until Britain proposed the anti-aggression declaration, could be completely used as a logical way to blame hypocritical diplomacy. With such diplomacy, is there any doubt that countless people and many countries have been sacrificed?</p>
<p>Now, Britain has abandoned its traditional policy, generously accepting restrictions, and giving Poland guarantees without end, and will guarantee Romania. But it is not only this; Chamberlain also said, "The restrictions accepted by Britain not only apply to a specific situation, but their goal is to curb any attempt to control the world by force." This is said so clearly, it seems that it is a new era. Sharing the beginning of this "new era" is the high-minded arguments of some people in Europe and America yesterday, whose meaning is that only this policy can stop war and preserve peace. Such pronouncements have their truth; the reason why aggression does not end is because concession is endless; looking back at the past, it is indeed so. But what must be understood is that a tough policy to curb aggression can be effective, but is not necessarily so; it is also effective but not necessarily effective in maintaining peace; because it is not necessarily effective, this new era should not be seen as sufficient to stop war and preserve peace. In other words, merely seeking to stop war and preserve peace is the "diplomatic rhetoric" and "diplomatic skills" that aggressor countries have long seen through, and therefore not worthy of the name "new era"! It is necessary to make the assumption that war is inevitable, and there must be the determination to use war to curb aggression, and the determination to build a permanent foundation for peace with war. Sweep away the stale diplomatic rhetoric and diplomatic skills, and make diplomacy a diplomacy of sincere action; then the new era will begin.</p>
<p>To complete this new era, in addition to Britain, France, and Poland, countries with long-standing unity of purpose, such as the United States and Soviet Russia, should generously cooperate and participate immediately; and in Britain, France, and Poland, it is especially necessary to use the utmost courage to be the backbone of the new era, even if they do not obtain the backing of other countries, they are determined to go. This would be the most glorious new era and the greatest achievement of mankind!</p>

<h3 id="e15">Economic Experts Freely Express Monetary Theories: Counterfeit Currency Will Inevitably Fail; Legal Tender Will Surely Circulate Endlessly <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) On February 11th of this year, Shanghai newspapers reported that the Japanese puppets were attempting to undermine legal tender. It was said that after the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in Peiping issued banknotes, in order to absorb legal tender and profit from foreign exchange, they forcibly restricted the circulation of legal tender in Peiping, Tianjin, and occupied urban areas on June 10th of the 27th year. Furthermore, on August 7th of the same year, they limited the circulation of banknotes with Tianjin place names from the Central Bank and Bank of Communications to 90% of their face value, and planned to change this to 60% starting from February 20th of this year, and to stop circulation altogether from March 10th. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter with an economic expert, who stated that counterfeit currency will inevitably fail, while our legal tender will surely circulate endlessly. The main points of his statement are recorded below: (1) Speaking first of the current financial market situation, the total amount of our legal tender circulating in the Peiping-Tianjin area, as of January 21st, was more than 320 million yuan. In order to stabilize its exchange rate, the government ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to maintain it at the legal rate. Since the entry into the second phase of the war of resistance, most of it has remained in the hands of people in the embassy district of Peiping, the concession in Tianjin, and the people of the inland countryside. Despite repeated sabotage by the Japanese puppets, it still circulates smoothly as before. On the contrary, the Shanghai water rate has increased from 15 to 25 yuan per thousand yuan. Its remarkable credibility has only become more solid after eighteen months of resistance. Conversely, the banknotes issued by the puppet United Reserve Bank, even if forcibly circulated, have actually depreciated to 886 to 878. This is because our legal tender has a substantial reserve fund and adopts an extremely prudent issuance policy. Regarding international commercial payments, it can still maintain a balance. Fellow countrymen in North China treasure the legal tender they obtain from selling agricultural and industrial products as if it were a priceless treasure. Recently, the continued efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States to replenish our foreign exchange stabilization fund have further demonstrated that our legal tender already has the superior conditions for unobstructed circulation. However, this is not the case for counterfeit money. Whether it is the counterfeit currency of our legal tender widely produced, or the counterfeit currency issued by the puppet United Reserve Bank, it has long been spurned by informed people because it has no reserve fund to speak of and is issued through despicable means. Even if its use is forcibly imposed, its nature is no different from the enemy's military scrip or the enemy government's worthless inconvertible banknotes, which at most is only a kind of disruption to our country's financial market. The fact that the enemy country prohibits the inflow of counterfeit United Reserve Bank banknotes into its own country to avoid accelerating the crisis of malignant inflation in its market, and that our compatriots in North China also pay it out as soon as they receive it, while rejecting all counterfeit legal tender, can prove this. I personally hope that our compatriots in North China will uphold their fervent patriotism, not be intimidated by violence, and respond appropriately. They will surely cause great chaos in the financial market of North China occupied by the enemy and puppets. As a result, the enemy will be unable to prolong its dark and brutal crimes with harmful currency. (2) From the perspective of monetary theory, the banknotes of the puppet United Reserve Bank also have reasons why they cannot circulate. There is a saying in monetary science that inferior coins drive out good coins, which refers to the quantity theory of money. However, the relationship between currency and the credit system is of utmost importance in modern commercial economics. Counterfeit money is not a hard currency and cannot even be said to drive out our legal tender. This is because counterfeit money lacks a reserve fund and has no credit foundation. In the history of world currency, there is no currency that lacks credit and can exist for a long time. Since counterfeit money has no credit foundation, it does not have the qualifications for circulation. Today, the puppet regime only relies on violence to maintain the circulation of counterfeit currency, and its inevitable failure can be predicted. (3) Furthermore, from the perspective of monetary management talent, since the implementation of the new monetary policy, our country's currency system has entered a new era. The management of legal tender has been carefully planned by our financial authorities, so that it can be easily handled even during wartime. The high level of intelligence and competence of our financial authorities, such as the leaders of the Central Bank and the Bank of China, is incomparable to the financial figures under the control of the Japanese puppets. Since the outbreak of the sacred war of resistance, the various wartime measures taken by our financial authorities are worthy of praise, such as stabilizing finance, managing foreign exchange, and planning the financial institutions and economic organizations of the southwest and northwest. Among these, the recent efforts to support the position of our legal tender in North China and resist the circulation of counterfeit money are particularly meritorious. On the contrary, many of those on the enemy side who lack talent and moral character occupy important positions, are senile and immature, and lack understanding. After invading for a year, they still cannot fathom the power and growing prestige of our legal tender. Now they are still plotting to undermine our legal tender in North China, only showing their futile efforts. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Red Star newspaper commented on the Sino-Japanese war, saying that the Japanese army's occupation of the Han River and areas near Nanchang is only of local significance and cannot affect the overall war situation. The plans of the Japanese warlords to exploit the occupied areas economically and launch further actions are largely built on sand. China's guerrilla movement is increasingly embracing the masses and poses a serious threat to such plans. The Japanese have failed to break the firm will of the Chinese army. The Chinese army is still able to maintain its excellent morale and fighting strength, and has the support of the anti-Japanese national united front, which is growing stronger and constantly resisting the Japanese occupying forces. The situation on the Japanese side is completely different. Anti-war sentiments have spread among their soldiers, and this sentiment has even infiltrated the ranks of officers. The increasing number of Japanese soldiers and officers killed for disobeying orders proves that turmoil has arisen within the supposedly "invincible" imperial army. The failure of the Japanese army's attempts to eliminate the guerrilla movement has further lowered the already low morale of the Japanese soldiers. The second front created throughout the occupied areas is demanding that the Japanese constantly increase their strength and military spending, causing the Japanese army's claims of victory to be completely in vain.

<p>(Singapore) Singapore's preparations for civilian defense against aerial and naval attacks are well underway. The relationship between the Royal Air Force and the civilians is increasing, as the authorities have decided that civilians on the island of Singapore will not be allowed to move inland during wartime. Therefore, camps have been set up in the countryside to accommodate tens of thousands of Chinese and other Asians from densely populated areas. The cooperation between the Chinese and the authorities in arranging emergency preparations is progressing smoothly. Six air raid warning devices will soon arrive here and will be installed in police stations, fire brigades, and other important buildings. After these devices are installed, preparations for defending against aerial bombardment and naval shelling will be greatly improved. The experience gained from the recent two blackout exercises has shown that air raid alarms can be sounded suddenly without prior notification. This measure will serve as a real test of public discipline and preparedness for cooperation with the island's defense forces in dealing with emergencies. The sound of the alarm can be heard within a radius of about two miles. The devices will be distributed to key locations throughout the island so that they can be heard far and wide. Sandbags are being shipped from England every week. In addition, auxiliary fire brigades, police, and wounded personnel are also arriving one after another, with each batch numbering about 500 people. The equipment for the fire brigade is also being ordered, and its efficiency will be three times greater than the existing equipment. The training of air raid watchmen has also made great progress. According to Commander Jog of the Royal Air Force in Singapore, the aim is to train 2,000 watchmen. Since the opening in March, the number of applicants has reached 1,000, almost all of whom are British-Chinese. All Royal Air Force publicity materials are printed in Chinese, English, Malay, and Tamil so that all residents can read them. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e29">British Government Leads the Organization of a European Anti-Aggression Alliance; Actively Wooing Various Countries to Participate in Mutual Protection of Independence; Urgently Seeking to Strengthen Romanian-Polish Relations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government is currently working hard to organize an anti-aggression alliance, the nature of which is similar to the various divine alliances of the Napoleonic era. This can be confirmed by the declaration issued by Prime Minister Chamberlain today. The main significance of this anti-aggression alliance is to establish joint relations among the participating countries, to help each other protect independence. In addition to giving guarantees to Poland, Britain will give the same guarantees to Romania and will adjust the current alliance treaty between the two countries so that they can jointly resist aggression if either is attacked. Regarding this, although Poland does not want to be hostile to Hungary, Romania insists that if Hungary assists Germany in aggression, the mutual assistance clauses in the Romanian-Polish alliance treaty should also be applied. As for the Soviet Union, its position in the anti-aggression alliance should be (for participating countries other than military), in other words, it should supply other countries with raw materials and munitions but not send troops to assist. Therefore, the objections raised by Romania and Poland to the participation of the Soviet Union no longer exist. Recently, the British government has requested that Romania and Poland clearly state their positions, and the answers can be delivered in a short time by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Romanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Tilea respectively. Responsible persons here believe that in addition to Romania and Poland, Britain should also strive to persuade other countries that are determined to defend their national independence and sovereignty to join. The talks between the Director of the Eastern European Department of the Foreign Office, Zent, and the ministers of Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Greece on the 1st of this month are very important. Britain hopes that Bulgaria will join the Balkan Entente and establish an understanding with Romania and Turkey, so that the situation in the Balkan Peninsula can be stabilized. In the event of war in the future, Romania can send troops through the Black Sea and the Dardanelles to assist the countries of the Balkan Entente. In addition, the Scandinavian countries should also be asked to supply raw materials. Portugal already has an alliance treaty with Britain, which should be strengthened so that it can fully protect its colonies. As for Spain, it is generally believed that Britain can obtain its assistance by providing financial assistance to the Nationalist government. Prince Balm of the two royal families recently came to London and has had contact with the British authorities on the issue of loans. As for Italy, responsible persons here all believe that the country will not place Albania under protection to confront Britain. (3rd Vas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Foreign policy authorities today believe that the new anti-aggression group led by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Europe has avoided the possibility of a major war breaking out in Europe immediately. Senior US officials unanimously agree with Chamberlain's declaration on German aggression and how to deal with it. Many believe that Germany may make demands on the Polish border, but it is expected that it will be resolved through negotiations rather than the use of force. Britain's willingness to provide military assistance to countries about to be invaded is strongly believed here to bring Nazi aggressive behavior to a complete halt for the time being.

<p>(Moscow) The "Legal Gazette" and the "Shi Shi Bao" recently published a Moscow dispatch from Havas, stating that the Soviet Union promised to supply Poland with military materials in the event of war, and to close its markets and stop supplying raw materials to Germany.

<p>(Paris) The difficulty in forming a common front to resist aggression lies in Poland's disregard for the passage of Soviet troops through its territory. It is known that in the event of war in the future, they will only supply munitions and will not send troops to assist. There is no need to worry about this. Moscow issued a semi-official statement yesterday, stating that the Soviet Union has never promised to supply munitions to Poland or Romania.

<p>Albanian Capital The government information office recently issued a notice stating that many newspapers, radio stations, and other sources have issued news, investigating the country that is placing Albania under protection, knowing that Albania's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity must not be allowed to be infringed upon by other countries.

<p>(Paris) The Italian government has informed the Albanian government that it will send troops to land at the port of Vlorë in the country in a short time.

Sources believe that Italy will not take any action without the full consent of King Zog of Albania. It is also rumored that Albania is now willing to be a semi-protectorate of Italy. At the same time that news of Italy's intentions in Albania resurfaced, the "Daily Telegraph" published an article criticizing Britain and France for plotting to place Greece and Albania next to Italy, intending to turn the two countries against Italy.

<h3 id="e38">New Era in British Policy: Chamberlain's Resolute Declaration – Resist the Domination of the World by Force – Exert All Efforts to Avert War – Difficulties in Establishing Friendship with the Soviet Union Have Been Eliminated <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(London) During the debate in the House of Commons today regarding foreign policy, Prime Minister Chamberlain, amidst cheers, declared, "The declaration I made last Friday represents a major shift in the actions previously undertaken by Britain and in Britain's traditional political views. This declaration is not related to border incidents but to the major issues underlying them. If Poland is threatened, I am sure the Polish people will resist. If that happens, this declaration means that Britain and France will immediately step forward to support Poland." (The audience cheered upon hearing this.) "I believe the British people are now united in supporting not only what I have just said but also the purposes and objectives implied in my words. I also believe that the entire British Empire shares this support. The various parts of the British Empire abroad have been watching our efforts for peace with the fervent hope that these efforts will be successful. Now, they all realize that Europe has been subjected to unexpected and alarming events in recent months. We cannot live in this atmosphere of surprise and panic for long, and our common lives cannot proceed in this state of instability. The government has, to the best of its ability, used clear language to restore trust. I know that in doing so, the government has truly expressed the will of the British people," he said. The Prime Minister, at the beginning of his speech, recalled Hitler's promises to Britain and the world during the crisis last September that Germany did not want to dominate other nations but only to bring Germans within the German-speaking region back into its territory. He said, "At that time, Hitler told us that once this was done, it would be the end. Germany had no ambition to acquire more territory. Unexpectedly, this promise has now been completely abandoned, and trust has been utterly destroyed. The British government has had no choice but to change its policy. We have also heard that Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was justified by two reasons: one, historical ties, and two, fear of being attacked. This may sound reasonable, but how does it reconcile with the promises previously made? (The audience cheered.) Inevitably, they will have excuses when they expand their territory in the future. I am not saying that there is any provocation now. As far as I know, there has never been an official announcement of such ambitions. However, official discussions have been common. The impact of recent events has extended far beyond the countries directly involved, or even further than the consequences foreseen by those who caused these events.</p>
<p>Welcoming Cooperation with the Soviet Union Regardless of Political System</p>
<p>Referring to the talk of encircling Germany, the Prime Minister said it was absurd to describe a policy of self-defense as an aggressive policy of encirclement. "I do not wish to specify today which governments we will be consulting with now or in the future regarding the situation. However, I can now say something about the Soviet Union, because I am well aware that the Soviet Union is always in the minds of the opposition members, and I know that the opposition members still have some doubts as to whether the so-called ideological differences will prevent us from acting together in events where we have mutual interests. I do not deny the existence of ideological differences. These differences remain unchanged. However, we believe that regardless of ideological differences, they are truly insignificant in such major issues. What we emphasize now is the preservation of our independence. By 'our independence,' I mean the independence of all countries threatened by aggression. Therefore, we welcome cooperation from any country, regardless of its political or internal system. This is not for aggression but for resisting aggression."</p>
<p>Declaration of Commitment to Poland Must Be Implemented Effectively</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "The result of today's debate will show the world that the House of Commons fundamentally agrees with the declaration made on Friday. The House will demonstrate its united and resolute spirit in adopting any necessary plans to ensure the declaration is implemented effectively. The declaration on Friday was indeed a new and great transformation in British foreign policy, and it added a commitment beyond the obligation of prudent regulations publicly announced by former Foreign Secretary Eden in his famous speech. The declaration on Friday was very clear and left no room for misunderstanding. It is not focused on the details of border incidents but on the major issues hidden behind them, namely the independence of Poland. If Poland's borders are threatened, the Polish people will rise up in resistance, and Britain and France will immediately come to Poland's aid. This is the meaning of the declaration on Friday." The Prime Minister also recounted his broadcast address to the nation on September 27 of last year, in which he said, "I am a man of peace. I regard international armed conflict as a devil. But if I knew that any country was determined to dominate the world by force, I would definitely think it necessary to resist it, because people who believe in freedom would find life unworthy of living under such domination." He said that he did not think Germany's demands on Czechoslovakia at the time necessarily meant Germany's intention to dominate, so he did not feel it was appropriate to ask the nation to accept new obligations. He later expressed his views on President Roosevelt's New Year's message, believing that if a country sought to dominate other countries, as President Roosevelt said, it must be resisted.</p>
<p>Hoping Germany Will Realize the Folly of War and Turn Swords into Ploughshares</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then explained to the House of Commons how Germany had broken the promises made by Hitler himself, destroying the world's trust and forcing the British government to change its attitude. He said, "Recent events have shocked the world. The entire British public feels the absolute necessity to clarify Britain's position. I say this reluctantly. I am not a warmonger. Today, as in September last year, I do not want to impose on the German people the treatment that the British people do not want. I had hoped that the commercial discussions that had begun in Germany would benefit both Britain and Germany and other countries, but trust has now been shaken and cannot be easily restored. If Germany is engaged in a plan to dominate the world by force, then the consequences will go beyond today. If the German government has no intention of seeking hegemony, then that is excellent, because if so, any agreement aimed at ensuring the independence of countries that are clearly threatened will not need to be implemented. I hope that our actions, which are just beginning and not ending, will not lead to a war that achieves nothing, adds nothing, and stops nowhere, but will lead to a turning point towards a new era where reason replaces force and theory replaces threats," he said.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Foreign Secretary's Full Speech in the House of Lords <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax, speaking in the House of Lords today about the British government's guarantee to Poland, said, "After Hitler's speech on January 30, there seemed to be hope that no serious event would occur to shake Europe's trust. The British government was eager to cooperate with all countries, so Commerce Minister Stanley accepted the German government's invitation to go to Berlin to assist in commercial negotiations. Unexpectedly, Europe underwent another change, and this trip was cancelled. Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia – the importance of this action needs no explanation from me. The incorporation of eight million Czechs into Germany clearly contradicted the principles previously advocated by Hitler. Other countries neighboring Germany naturally felt that their national independence was also at risk, given Germany's actions. Therefore, the British government believed it was necessary to find a way to restore some trust in Europe, and it has been in contact with several other countries to this end. Negotiations are still in progress, and I am not yet able to make a final statement at this time. However, I can say that the British government is fully aware of the importance of the Soviet government's attitude and highly values the good relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. We must, of course, take into account the fact that some countries' relations with the Soviet Union are quite complicated. However, I can assure the House that, as far as the British government is concerned, these difficulties do not exist. As for the contact between the British and French governments, it has been very close throughout this difficult period. The two governments are in agreement on all issues, and the British government can always rely on France's full cooperation. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived in London today, and I will have a frank discussion with him on many issues of common interest. Some say that Britain's actions towards Poland imply an encirclement of Germany. This is not the case. In fact, Germany's rise in the center of Europe is overwhelming. If its neighbors have doubts about Germany's intentions and want to take joint action for self-defense, this is a result of human nature and is certainly not caused by Britain's new policy of external pressure. Our contact with other countries does not stem from a spirit of hostility towards any country, but from our hope and belief that we can thereby consolidate stability and peace in Europe," he said. Labour Peer Lord Snell recounted the Labour Party's views on the situation, saying that the Labour Party agreed with the statements recently made by the government and welcomed the change in policy that had been shown. Liberal Peer Lord Crewe also spoke on behalf of the opposition Liberal Party, supporting the government's declaration. However, Lord Arnold expressed surprise at the opposition party's claim that this matter did not need to be debated, saying that history would see Britain's guarantee to Poland as the most unwise and dangerous decision ever made. The House of Lords then adjourned. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Members of Parliament, Regardless of Party, Unanimously Support the Government <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Opposition Leader Attlee was unable to attend due to illness, so Labour Deputy Leader Greenwood spoke on his behalf to begin the debate. Greenwood said he believed that before the House adjourned, it could show the world the united determination of the British people to cooperate with other countries in order to establish a strong and insurmountable barrier to resist continued aggression. The Labour Party supported the Prime Minister's declaration on Friday, and he hoped that the limited compromise expressed in the declaration would become a plan for mutual guarantees on a broader basis. The government, proceeding along this line, would certainly receive the assistance of the Labour Party. If it deviated from this work, it would be opposed by the Labour Party. He wished to state that the Labour Party was not a mere yes-man to a government of national unity. What the Labour Party cared about was principles and policies, which were more important than individuals.</p>
<p>Liberal Opposition Leader Sinclair then spoke, saying that he recognized that the provisional guarantee given to Poland was part of the current situation and was a necessary one. If he did not admit his mistake, the government's aim of ensuring victory in a possible war was not as assured as preventing the outbreak of war. There was no longer any dispute that Hitler aimed to control the entire world. Therefore, the only way to prevent war was to create an invincible resistance to aggression and to make it clear to Hitler and his generals that if they attacked any neighboring country, they would face war on two fronts. The British people certainly abhorred war, but when Hitler knew that the British government would avoid the final act of war, he could never successfully negotiate with him.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Churchill, speaking, ridiculed the view that British policy aimed to encircle Germany, saying that he often preached that if Germany was willing, it could also be given the same guarantee. If Hitler feared that the Soviet Union would ravage Germany, Poland would take the opportunity to attack, Belgium or the Netherlands would also strike, and Denmark might threaten to impose pressure, then he only needed to publicly announce his concerns so that he could obtain the most solemn international guarantees. Surprisingly, Britain, led by the Prime Minister, finally announced in clear terms and almost unanimously that the defense of Europe's freedom was a doctrine that Britain dared to undertake with all its strength. He was pleased to hear that the Prime Minister had dismissed the attempt to belittle the guarantee given to Poland. The government's attitude towards the Soviet Union had been carefully considered. The Soviet Union was a significant weight on the scales of world peace, and the Soviet Union was now deeply affected by German ambitions. Britain's initiation of resistance to aggression was a pioneering move. It was the first time that the leaders of the National Socialist Party saw the possibility of encountering war on two fronts. Opposition Liberal MP Lloyd George, speaking, sincerely congratulated the Prime Minister for returning to his policy from the last election, namely "not making cowardly concessions to aggressors," and said that the Prime Minister had opened a new page in the history of Great Britain and the history of the world's nations. Lloyd George also urgently said that it was imperative to win the sponsorship of the world's greatest military force, namely the Soviet Union. After discussing military strategy, Lloyd George added that if a dispute occurred between Poland and Germany, Britain would be powerless to help and must rely on the Soviet Union to come to Poland's aid.</p>
<p>Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Eden joined the discussion, expressing his views on the strategic considerations raised by Lloyd George, saying that half of the German troops would certainly be concentrated on the Polish border, but at least half would have to be stationed on the Western Front. Attacking on two fronts, while not impossible, would be extremely difficult. Compared to the situation in 1919, there was one important difference: Turkey and Egypt were now friends with Britain. Now that the Prime Minister had made the entire nation unanimously support the government's foreign policy, this was of great value when negotiating with other countries. The government could take comfort in the fact that Chamberlain's speech truly represented national sentiment. Today, it was best to organize everything and engage in preparations for war, he said. The entire House cheered upon hearing Eden's words. The proposal to organize a government of national unity on a broader basis was then withdrawn.</p>

<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, speaking last on behalf of the government to conclude the debate, said in brief that anything that could make Britain stronger and more united must be vigorously promoted. Now that Britain must devote its full strength to this vital task, all conveniences, comforts, wealth, or habits were not comparable to this necessity. When necessary, Britain would use this strength to resist aggression and fight against it. However, he felt that this effort laid a larger and more stable foundation for an organization that sought peace. If peace was achieved, it would be aided by the unanimity of the British House of Commons, he said. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Berlin) There is much skepticism here about British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today. A political commentator told a Reuters reporter, "What makes us suspicious is that the country he wants to help has not called for help, but only the country providing aid has issued this statement." The assurances issued by Britain that it did not want to threaten Germany were regarded here as a "platitude." A local newspaper commented, "Chamberlain is trying to use his umbrella as a Damocles' sword over Germany," implying that it was extremely dangerous. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Moscow Announces the Course of Fisheries Agreement Negotiations – Japan Yields to the Soviet Union and Achieves Success <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement signed on April 2, Soviet newspapers have recently published the full text of the protocol and the aide-mémoire from Litvinov to Japanese Ambassador Tamekame, along with a commentary from TASS on the event, the contents of which are as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters were obtained through the Treaty of Portsmouth. Until recently, they were regulated by the 1928 Fisheries Convention and the 1932 Supplementary Agreement. According to the convention, the Japanese were to acquire fishing grounds through auctions. According to the supplementary agreement, only new fishing grounds were to be auctioned, while old fishing grounds operated by the Japanese in the past were automatically leased to the Japanese based on lease agreements. The terms of the convention and supplementary agreement expired as early as December 1936. At the same time, the Japanese government also announced the cancellation of the convention, with the clear intention of obtaining greater benefits for its fishermen in the new convention. The negotiations for a new long-term fisheries convention, which began in 1936, did not yield results due to Japan's adoption of an extremely obvious anti-Soviet policy, especially manifested in the Japanese-German alliance under the guise of the Anti-Comintern Pact (therefore, the 1928 convention and supplementary agreement were extended twice in 1937 and 1938, each for one year).</p>
<p>In November 1938, the Japanese side proposed reopening negotiations for a new convention. The Soviet government responded that it must fulfill the guarantee of the payment conditions for the Chinese Eastern Railway in "Manchukuo" (to date, "Manchukuo" has not paid the final installment) before it would agree to hold such negotiations. Later, the Japanese government disregarded this condition, and the Soviet government agreed to negotiate only a temporary fisheries agreement for one year. In addition, the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs exchanged aide-mémoires and memoranda with the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union multiple times. The Soviet government declared from the beginning that it had decided to restore the auction system for both new fishing grounds and fishing grounds previously operated by the Japanese. Regarding other conditions, it was prepared to conclude a temporary agreement based on the 1928 convention, except that Article 8 of the convention, which stipulated that any fishing ground that had been opened could not be closed and must be auctioned or leased to the lessee without auction, could not continue to be valid. Regarding this point, the Soviet government announced its decision to reclaim 40 fishing grounds operated by the Japanese for military strategic reasons, including four attached to canning factories and one with a lease agreement that would not expire until 1941. Later, the Soviet government agreed to reduce the number of fishing grounds to be reclaimed to 37. In addition, the Soviet government also opposed the original convention's provision that allowed the Japanese to interfere with the Soviet state-owned fisheries' fishing quota, which was limited to 2 million poods.</p>
<p>The Japanese side firmly opposed the auction and demanded the automatic extension of all fishing ground leases, whether previously operated by the Japanese or expired. The Japanese side especially insisted on opposing the reclamation of 37 fishing grounds, putting forward unfounded reasons claiming that all the fishing grounds previously obtained by the Japanese were "stable" fishing grounds and must permanently be operated by the Japanese. The Japanese side also insisted that if the auction system was adopted, the fishing grounds operated by Soviet state-owned fisheries should also be auctioned equally. Subsequently, the Japanese side initially agreed to the reclamation of 12 fishing grounds and then increased it to 24, but demanded that they be replaced by the same number and equivalent value, and that the Japanese side should choose the replacement fishing grounds.</p>
<p>The Soviet government firmly rejected the principle of replacing or compensating fishing grounds reclaimed from the Japanese side for any reason. Regarding the above-mentioned disputed issues, the Japanese side's demands were based solely on the Treaty of Portsmouth. As had been repeatedly pointed out to the Japanese side, the treaty did not stipulate the procedure for leasing fishing grounds to the Japanese, the number of fishing grounds operated by the Japanese, the so-called "stability" of Japanese fishing grounds, or the restrictions on the Soviet Union due to the existence of fishing grounds. In addition, it was pointed out that the treaty had been violated by the Japanese side itself on multiple occasions. Due to its weak official position, the Japanese side repeatedly tried to invoke the corresponding articles in the Fisheries Convention and Supplementary Agreement, regardless of the fact that they had expired and were therefore no longer binding on the Soviet government. After the Japanese side had clearly agreed to accept the auction system and abandoned the so-called stability principle, the Soviet government also agreed to put nine additional fishing grounds of its own choice up for auction, allowing the Japanese to acquire them.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the two sides reached an agreement on the following terms:</p>
<p>First, the Japanese can only acquire fishing grounds whose lease agreements have expired through auctions.</p>
<p>Second, for military strategic reasons, 37 fishing grounds operated by the Japanese will be reclaimed, including four attached to canning factories. All such canning factories will also be closed.</p>
<p>Third, one of the 37 fishing grounds, because its lease agreement does not expire until 1941, will be replaced by another fishing ground granted by the Soviet government for the same term.</p>
<p>Fourth, the fishing grounds obtained by the Japanese through auction should have a five-year lease agreement in accordance with the 1928 convention. The Soviet government has never opposed this point.</p>
<p>Fifth, the fishing grounds attached to the canning factories set up by the Japanese, except for the above four, should be re-leased for another year without auction. The Soviet government has also never opposed this point.</p>
<p>Sixth, unlike the provisions of the 1928 convention, the Soviet government will henceforth determine the fishing quota for state-owned fisheries itself. The estimate for the 1929 fiscal year is 5 million poods.</p>
<p>Seventh, nine Soviet fishing grounds should be put up for auction in addition. Because the Japanese did not participate in the auction on March 15, the Soviet fisheries authorities auctioned off six of these nine, as well as four fishing grounds previously operated by the Japanese. Now, these agencies are willing to cede these fishing grounds to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Eighth, because the Japanese ambassador expressed concern that rental prices might be raised indefinitely in the auction, the Soviet Far East Fisheries Administration stated that it was not prepared to raise rental prices by more than 10%.</p>
<p>The most contentious issues in this negotiation were the restoration of the auction system, the reclamation of 37 fishing grounds operated by the Japanese, the correction of the false theory regarding the stability of Japanese fishing grounds, and the special status of Soviet state-owned fisheries in the Far East. Because all of these issues have been resolved, the Soviet government and people from all walks of life are completely satisfied with the agreement now signed. (3rd, TASS)</p>
<h3 id="e44">British Newspaper Comments on Japanese-Soviet Relations <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian, in an editorial commenting on the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, stated that the Soviet Union has now completed a small but practical demonstration to show the world how to deal with aggressor nations. The Japanese government had been arrogant, boasting, and threatening, but Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov remained unmoved. How correct this attitude was has now been proven. Japan has now yielded, only needing the Soviet Union to agree to extend the old fisheries agreement for another year, in which case Japan is willing to pay an increased fee of one-tenth and lease a fishing area 27 less than last year. Litvinov was magnanimous and has promised. As for France, the opposite is true. Relying on "compromise," it now finds that it was a mistake. Hainan, which was once considered a French protectorate, has now been occupied by Japan. The New South Island, which was occupied by the French Navy in 1930 and formally declared occupied by the French government in 1933, has now also been annexed by Japan. Japan's actions thus demonstrate two trends in its policy: the southward advance eagerly sought by the Japanese naval community and the doctrine of aggression along the path of least resistance embraced by the general Japanese population, it said.

<h3 id="e45">Siam and Vietnam <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper’s special dispatch: In the future world war, the only Far Eastern nation likely to be enticed by fascist aggressor countries is probably Siam. Due to the mutual constraints between the two strong powers, Britain and France, Siam's fate is better than its neighbors, Burma and Annam. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it remained a buffer state and did not suffer the pain of national subjugation. However, its territory has been partially ceded nine times. First, France occupied the provinces of Luang Prabang and Battambang. Second, in 1909, Britain seized Siam's Malay vassal states, namely the four small countries of Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, and Perlis. This national humiliation is something Siam can never forget.</p>
<p>Moreover, among Siam's population of fifteen million, our overseas compatriots account for two and a half million. Besides fearing the partition by Britain and France, they also worry about the country's economic power falling into the hands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, Siam's position in Asia today is similar to Hungary's position in Europe. What it demands is to recover the lost territories since the previous century and gain true independence and autonomy.</p>
<p>This is Siam's legitimate demand, but unfortunately, Siam has not used legitimate revolutionary means to achieve its legitimate demands. In order to oppose imperialism, it has instead thrown itself into the embrace of imperialism. Since the September 18th Incident, Siam has been the only Asian country to openly express pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese sentiments. In 1933, when the League of Nations passed a resolution confirming Japan's actions, only Siam abstained. Overseas Chinese in Siam are constantly subjected to cruel treatment, and freedom of anti-Japanese speech and assembly is completely deprived.</p>
<p>They are both oppressed nations, so why should they exclude each other? This is not surprising, as Siam is still a semi-feudal and semi-colonial military dictatorship. It is inherently easy to embark on the path of fascism. Furthermore, because it wants to avenge and redress against Britain and France, it unconsciously fell into Japan's trap of aggression. In recent years, the Siamese military government has hired Japanese advisors, purchased Japanese weapons, and its politics are greatly influenced by Japan. Japan wants to lend money to Siam to dig the Kra Canal, so that Far Eastern ships can reach the Indian Ocean without passing through Singapore. If this project succeeds, it will undoubtedly cause serious damage to Britain's military and commercial position in the Far East. Although this plan has been temporarily shelved due to British opposition, it has not been completely abandoned. Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, German forces have also infiltrated Siam. Recently, Germany has supplied Siam with a significant amount of weapons, which has further increased the unease of Britain and France. Although Siam does not currently have the possibility of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, key government figures in Siam have repeatedly expressed sympathy for the governments of the Anti-Comintern bloc.</p>
<p>If Siam throws itself into the embrace of the fascist bloc, it will naturally threaten Britain's colonies in the Far East, but French Vietnam is in an even more dangerous position than British Burma. Because if Siam joins the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it will first recover Luang Prabang and Battambang. In addition, the French protectorates of Laos and Tonkin are also the targets Siam wants to seize. This is because the two nations of Laos and Tonkin were conquered by Siam as early as the 16th century. After these territories are lost, most of Vietnam's territory will be gone. Coupled with Japan's offensive from Hainan Island, Vietnam will no longer be French Vietnam.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of South China and occupation of Hainan Island have made France's Far Eastern colonies uneasy. In addition, since the last World War, Siam's military strength has been increasing day by day, and a conscription system has long been implemented in the country. In wartime, it can mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops. In recent years, Siam has also established a navy, ordering warships and submarines from Germany and Japan. The air force also has a considerable scale. Once wartime comes, it goes without saying that Vietnam is the most dangerous old friend on its back. Therefore, the relationship between Vietnam and Siam is the most worrying point for France regarding the security of its Far Eastern colonies.</p>
<p>Britain and France are dealing with Siam in the same way they deal with the Franco government in Spain, trying to use loans, trade, and various benefits as inducements, hoping to ease the conflict with Britain and France. As far as the relationship between France and Siam is concerned, there has been considerable success in recent months. The commercial treaty between Vietnam and Siam was signed several months ago and has now been approved by both the French and Siamese parliaments. Three months ago, France sent a military delegation to Bangkok for consultation. This time, the Vietnamese army and the large-scale military exercises near Lang Son, Siam also sent two officers to review the exercises. Currently, Siam and Vietnam maintain a good neighborly relationship on the surface, which is a reality. However, we know that aggressor countries will not stop their conspiracies to cause trouble for a moment. Once a European war breaks out and France's military strength in the Far East is weakened, no one can guarantee what the situation in southern Asia will become. In order to protect its interests in the Far East, what forces will France rely on? Isn't that already too clear?</p>
<h3 id="e46">Outbreak of the Great War in South China: Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Heshui. The Prelude to the Great War on the West River Unveiled <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong correspondence: Taking advantage of the tense situation in Europe, the Japanese side mobilized a large army and launched a large-scale invasion in central Hubei and northern Jiangxi. Since the fall of Nanchang, the war in northern Hunan has also intensified. Their intention is nothing more than to attempt to attack Changsha and open up the Yuehan Railway to fulfill their ambition of aggression. However, at this time, the long-silent war in South China has also become increasingly tense. South China is located in the vanguard of central and southwest China. If the Japanese army wants to open up the Yuehan Railway, it must simultaneously launch an attack northward in South China. Therefore, recently, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has been conducting frequent exercises, and thousands of new soldiers have been transferred from the country, landing in Huangpu and Guangzhou, and successively reinforcing the West River. At the same time, construction projects are being carried out day and night in various places in the West River and northern Guangdong. By late March, the Japanese army in Guangzhou and Foshan began to attack Shunde Daliang to the south, pressing towards Zhongshan to the south, and eyeing the Siyi area to the west. On the morning of the 28th, the Japanese army in the West River and Siyi area suddenly launched an attack simultaneously, using the full force of its army, navy, and air force to fiercely attack the Chinese army. Their main force was obviously in the Sanshui area of the upper reaches of the Siyi West River. Although the Japanese army had increased by 3,000 and carried out frequent bombardments, because of the solidity of the Chinese defenders' positions, they did not dare to rashly attack. They had to avoid the strong and attack the weak, attacking Zhongshan from Shunde in the south, and at the same time coordinating naval forces to attack Jiangmen. For a time, the army, navy, and air force advanced simultaneously, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented since the start of the war in South China. After fierce fighting until the evening of the 28th, Jiangmen was captured by the Japanese army, and the situation in Zhongshan was also very critical. However, by the evening of the 29th, Jiangmen was recaptured by the Chinese army. Currently, the war is extremely fierce in that area. Due to geographical reasons, the Chinese side does not have a strong garrison here, relying only on the People's Self-Defense Forces and security teams to fight to the death with the Japanese army. Therefore, the sacrifice is naturally expected. Another route of the Japanese army attacked Heshui from the west, coordinating with the artillery in Jiujiang and the ships on the West River to attack Gulao Haikou. The battle was very fierce. On the afternoon of the 28th, a part of the Japanese army had rushed into Haikou. At the same time, they advanced along the Jiujiang-Foshan highway to Gubu, threatening Heshui's new city. The two sides repeatedly charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and both suffered heavy casualties. Because the two armies were only a short distance apart, Japanese aircraft could no longer bomb, so the area was in a state of mixed warfare. Judging from this offensive by the Japanese army, their purpose is twofold: one is to consolidate the rear of Guangzhou, so they intend to occupy Zhongshan and Jiangmen, so that there will be no worries; the attack from Heshui is obviously threatening Gaoming and attacking Gaoyao (Zhaoqing) from the side. This is because the Chinese defenses in Zhaoqing are solid, the military strength is strong, and there is the danger of the Lingyang Gorge in front, making it impossible for the Japanese navy to operate. If they only attack with the army, the heavy casualties are bound to be expected, and it is difficult to win. Therefore, they used this roundabout tactic to try to attack Zhaoqing from the side or bypass the back of Zhaoqing. However, it is difficult to say whether the current purpose of the Japanese army's attack on South China is to penetrate deep into the West River, threaten Guangxi, and place the main force on that route. Weighing the situation, it is extremely difficult to attack the West River, and the timing to threaten Guangxi has not yet matured. If we look at the fact that the Japanese army in central China is currently actively besieging Changsha, it seems that the Japanese army in South China will also actively advance north along the Yuehan Railway, attacking from both sides, in order to capture central China as soon as possible, and then slowly plan Guangxi and threaten the southwest. According to this, the fierce fighting in the West River and Zhongshan area is just a trick by the Japanese to create a diversion. In the future, the main battlefield of the war in South China may be in northern Guangdong. According to news from two days ago, the Japanese army in Huaxian Xinjie is increasing day by day, and there is a pattern of advancing north. Therefore, the fierce battle in northern Guangdong may also break out soon. In summary, in the current stage of the Sino-Japanese War, the most intense areas are, in addition to Jiangxi and Hunan, South China. In fact, the wars in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong are interrelated. The Japanese army is strategically echoing each other from a distance, which is very obvious, and South China is of great importance to the overall situation.</p>

<p>Taixian Communication: Although the Jiangsu Provincial Government is in a difficult environment, it is still urging the responsible personnel to direct and command tens of thousands of civilians to continue the project of dredging the accumulated water in Gaoyou, Binjiang, Xinghua, Taixian, Yancheng, and Funing counties. The breaches of the Chexin and Liangba Dams on the canal have been closed after three weeks of closure on the 27th and 28th of March respectively, and the embankment restoration project is now being rushed. The Yellow River water upstream has been cut off, and the Erzai Maoyou River, the waterway to the sea, has also been dredged one after another. A part of it has now been completed. In recent days, the accumulated water downstream has been greatly reduced. The river land in Dongtai and Gaobao counties has been divided, and most of the elevated fields have dried up. Farmers are busy with spring plowing. If the waterway to the sea project is fully completed, the accumulated water in various counties in northern Jiangsu will be completely dried up.</p>

<p>Taixian Communication: The Jiangsu Provincial Government is now organizing a joint defense headquarters for eight counties including Huai'an, Baoying, Taixian, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Funing, Xinghua, and Dongtai, and has appointed commissioners Jin Zonghua and Chen Guiqing as the commander and deputy commander respectively. After Jin and others were appointed, they have announced their assumption of office.</p>
<p>The people in the Huaihai and Yancheng area have recently organized anti-war organizations in large numbers and are cooperating with the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. They have destroyed the Zhenghai Highway and the eastern section of the Suihai Road in sections, making it impossible for the Japanese army to repair them, and their actions are extremely difficult. The Japanese army in Funing has recently burned many villages and towns in the surrounding countryside. The people are even more resentful of the Japanese army and are determined to never coexist with them.</p>
<p>He Xingzhen, which belongs to Funing County, has become a hub for commercial transportation in northern Jiangsu during the anti-Japanese war in northern Jiangsu. The waterway of Green Town can directly reach Shanghai. Since it was occupied by the Japanese army at the end of last year, commercial transportation has been greatly affected. According to reliable news, the Japanese army in the town withdrew completely on the morning of March 25, and the Japanese cavalry of forty or fifty people at Chenjiaqiao on the border of Funing and Lianshui also returned to Funing on the same day. On the way, they were attacked by the Chinese people, and dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or injured.</p>

<p>Shantou Communication: Large Japanese fleets often pass through the overseas area of Chaoshan. It has been raining continuously for days, and the military and civilians continue to deploy and drill in the field, without interruption due to the bad weather. Since the 24th, representatives from various national salvation organizations have been elected to go to Chao'an to hold a meeting to discuss the expansion of the spiritual mobilization and the national covenant oath movement. On the 25th, the people of Shantou evacuated to the inland in batches. Passenger traffic on land and water was particularly crowded. At that time, the war situation in northern Jiangxi had spread throughout Chaoshan. The people here are concerned about the war situation in Ganjiang and pay equal attention to the coast. At about 7:00 am on the 26th, three Japanese warships sailed from southern Fujian and anchored outside Mayu, stopping near Nan'ao. The number of large and small ships along the coast of Chaoshan suddenly increased to fifteen or sixteen. At about 8:00 am, four Japanese planes flew out of the Japanese warships and bombed the Shantou Railway Main Station. The Japanese planes flew low to less than a thousand feet and opened fire and strafed. Six bombs fell near the station. The entire ticket office collapsed and destroyed one passenger car and one locomotive. Dozens of holes were pierced in the carriages by machine gun bullets, and a certain Cao of the railway police was injured. Fortunately, the passengers had dispersed and the losses were not large. The plane flew to Chao'an and dropped bombs at Yixi Station, with the aim of destroying the North Causeway so that spring water would flood into the three counties of Chaojiepu, creating a second Yellow River flood. Fortunately, two bombs fell into the river, causing no damage to the North Causeway. At 11:00 am, a Japanese plane flew to Chaohui for reconnaissance without dropping bombs. At 2:00 pm, four Japanese planes flew to Jieyang and chased the Shanjie wheel Dahua, opening machine guns to shoot back and forth on the Guanbu River. Passengers jumped into the water to escape, killing eight people and injuring fifteen or sixteen people. They then went to Yixi and dropped eight bombs, opening fire to chase the train. The train stopped at Fuyang Station, destroying one car. The details of passenger losses are unknown. There are dozens of ships outside Shantou Port, and they seem to be spying on Raoping Chenghai. Japanese ships cruising overseas intercepted sailing ships. It is said that Nan'ao Houzhai Long'ao was re-occupied by the Japanese army after they landed. Due to the interruption of transportation, the truth is unknown. The Chaozhou-Shantou Railway tracks were blown off by dozens of feet and are being repaired.</p>
<p>The train service has been suspended.</p>
<p>Wu Qijun, the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Army Group, recently sent a large member to inspect the guerrillas in Dongjiang and ordered a general attack on Shilong, Zengcheng, and Dongguan. The war along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will begin within ten days. Wu recently received an order from his superiors to concurrently serve as the director of the border area of the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Wu inspected Shanghang, Wuping, Xunwu, Huichang, Pingyuan, and Xingning counties on the 24th, and established an office in the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River. On the 27th, he convened a meeting of the military, political, and party leaders of the three provinces to discuss the exchange of salt and rice between Guangdong and Jiangxi, the transportation and supply of food during wartime, the consolidation of local security, and the expansion of military-civilian cooperation. The meeting place was in Xingning and will be completed at the end of the month. Miao Peinan, the deputy commander of the Ninth Army Group, is stationed in Heyuan to preside over the counter-offensive military operations. Chi Zhongkuan has been appointed as the commander of the south bank of the Dongjiang River, and Zhang Ruigui as the commander of the north bank. The troops of Luo Fengxiang, Luo Kun, Liang Zhu, Wang Ruozhou, Zhang Wodong, Yuan Huazhao, and Liu Fayu have been inspected and are waiting for orders in the designated areas.</p>
<h3 id="e50">"Central China Company" Monopolizes the Silk Industry; Zhenyi Factory is Destroyed <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi Communication: Wuxi is a famous factory area in China. In its heyday, there were more than 60 silk spinning mills in the county. After the fall, all the factories were seized by the Japanese army. The Japanese company "Central China Company" invested 8 million yuan, and cooperated with local ruffians Zhang Zizhen and Qian Fenghao for expenses. Chinese capital accounted for 49%, and the Central China Company accounted for 91%. In fact, all personnel and equipment were controlled by Japanese businessmen. It is estimated that in the one year of the 27th year, a profit of 2 million yuan was made, and the entire county's silk industry was monopolized. At present, ten companies including Zhenyi, Hefeng, and Dingchang have started construction and are all controlled by the Central China Company. The county magistrate of the county and the 3rd Battalion of the 10th Detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army and the Wuxi West District Joint Defense Force learned of the situation and decided to destroy the largest silk factories such as Zhenyi. The situation of each slightly recorded in the previous report, it is known that at 7:30 pm on March 23, more than 300 troops from Zhou Hanliang and Hu Shaomei of the West District troops gathered at Huishan Town and attacked the Japanese army in Wuqiao. At that time, there were more than 400 Japanese troops stationed in Lixin Cloth Factory and the Educational College, and they all came out upon hearing the news. The two sides confronted each other on the east and west banks of Wuqiao. After two hours of fierce fighting, at 10:20, they began to withdraw westward. In this battle, 12 Japanese soldiers were killed, 2 Chinese translators were killed, and 1 was injured. Zhou's team members Niu Genbao was seriously injured in the leg, Aqing was injured in the right hand, and there were no other losses. At the same time, 37 members of the traitors removal group of the 3rd Battalion of the 10th Detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army and more than 100 members of the 9th Squadron, led by the deputy battalion commander You Guozhen, carried fuel and arrived at their destination at 8:00. They immediately ordered a part of the 9th Squadron to guard the area of Dagong Bridge and a part to guard Qingming Bridge, and to guard the Huangmin Bridge in the South Gate and the South Gate flag station. The rest rushed into the Zhenyi Silk Factory. At that time, Zhou and Hu's troops on the west side had already contacted the Japanese army, and the Japanese army was restrained by them, so You's troops were able to set fire to all parts of the factory, including the stove room, the cleaning room, the silk cooking room, and the accounting room. At that time, a lot of net silk and dry cocoons were stored in the factory, and the estimated loss was more than 300,000 yuan. At 10:00, the unit withdrew northward after the task was completed, and distributed the "Letter to the Workers of the Central China Company," urging them to be sensible.</p>

<p>The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, after bidding a temporary farewell to the Japanese authorities after a visit, took the Canadian Empress ship to Shanghai, and will arrive in port at about 2:00 pm today (the 5th). Senior British officials in Shanghai, from the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, downwards, will all come to the port to welcome him. It is understood that the ambassador is here to meet with Ambassador Clark Kerr and to express his feelings. Ambassador Craigie will not stay in Shanghai for a long time, and intends to take a ship to Japan to return to his post on the 7th. If the time is tight, it may be extended to the 8th to leave Shanghai. Although the embassy has not announced the mission of Craigie's arrival in Shanghai, it is generally believed that it is to discuss the future policy of the United Kingdom on the Far Eastern issue. As for the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who originally planned to go to Chongqing immediately to visit the central government authorities, he will leave as soon as he meets with Ambassador Craigie. Yesterday, it was learned that his travel date has been roughly set on the 9th to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong, and then transfer to Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Times reported that two foreign ambassadors stationed in the Far East are expected to arrive in Shanghai within a week. One is Mr. Cosme, who succeeded Mr. Knazevich as the French ambassador to China, will arrive in Shanghai next week. The other is the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, who is expected to arrive in port tomorrow (the 5th). Ambassador Cosme is coming to Shanghai for the first time. Although he will take the opportunity to discuss with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the Far Eastern events that affect the interests of the British government, it is heard that the main nature of this trip is to come to Shanghai for vacation. The British Ambassador to Japan took the Canadian Empress liner and will arrive in port tomorrow. Clark Kerr will meet him. Craigie will only stay in Shanghai for a few days and take a ship back to Japan on Friday. He recently told the press that the purpose of this trip was to take a vacation and to visit Shanghai for the first time, because he took the route through Canada when he went to Japan to take office that day, and did not pass through Shanghai. During Sir Robert Craigie's stay in Shanghai, it is quite possible that he will take the opportunity to meet with the French Ambassador. The French Ambassador has just presented his credentials to the National Government in Chongqing. In the next few days, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will set off for Chongqing. The purpose of this trip has not been announced. The following speculation news in the Japanese "Hirozhi Newspaper" regarding the imminent arrival of the new French Ambassador in Shanghai seems to confirm the Hong Kong telegram of the Tokyo Daily News. According to the "Hirozhi Newspaper", the new French Ambassador to China, Cosme, presented his credentials to Chairman Lin Sen in early March, and on March 13, he met with General Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing for three hours. It is heard that Cosme agreed to discuss with Chinese and British representatives in Hong Kong the methods of assisting China in the war of resistance. Cosme also said that the French government is preparing to hold a secret meeting, the purpose of which is to cooperate with the Soviet Union to assist China when a European war breaks out. The French Ambassador arrived in Hong Kong on March 23 and will go to Shanghai to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr.</p>
<p>Regarding the policy of assisting the Chinese government, it is reported that Chairman Chiang expressed disappointment to Britain and France for their attitude when the Japanese army seized Hainan Island. Cosme replied that the current situation in Europe does not allow Britain and France to take any active policies against Japan at present, but Cosme promised Chiang Kai-shek that France will cooperate with Britain in the future to expand active economic assistance to develop the resources of the southwestern provinces of China and will provide China with the convenience of purchasing military supplies.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Shanghai Municipal Council Announces: This Year's Western and Japanese Board Members; Only Nine Candidates; No Need to Vote; Will Take Office on the 20th Together with the Five Chinese Board Members <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The nomination for the 1939 Western and Japanese Board Members election of the Shanghai Municipal Council closed at noon today (the 4th). There are only nine nominated candidates, so there is no need to hold a vote. The following directors will take office on April 20 this year together with the five Chinese directors. The list of Chinese directors has not been notified to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Messrs. A.C. Cornish, C.S. Franklin, G.A. Haley, W.J. Keswick, R.G. MacDonald, G.E. Mitchell, Otsuichi Okamoto, T.S. Powell, and Tominosuke Sugisaka. Only one candidate for this year's Land Commissioner, Mr. R.D.K. Silby, was nominated by the registered property owners in the Public Concession, and he will be considered elected.</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that there will be no election of board members of the Shanghai Municipal Council this year. Although there have been rumors for several months that the Japanese were attempting to increase the number of representatives, the board members of the Shanghai Municipal Council are still five each for Chinese and British, and two each for American and Japanese. The election of the board members of the council ended at noon today (the 4th) in the Shanghai Municipal Council Building. There were nine seats for foreign board members, and the names received were exactly nine, so there was no need for an election. The American representatives are still the incumbents, so there is no change, namely the current Chairman Franklin and Cornish. There is also no change in the Japanese representatives, namely Otsuichi Okamoto and Tominosuke Sugisaka. Of the five British representatives who were nominated in the recent pre-election, Brigadier General Macnaghten and Mr. Matheson were defeated, and were replaced by San Haley and Powell. The re-elected members are Mitchell Keswick and MacDonald. In the future municipal year, the Shanghai Municipal Council will be composed of these nine people and the five Chinese board members who have not yet been elected. The election of the Chinese board members will be held within two weeks. According to the situation, it seems that the current representatives Guo Shun, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Yuan Ludeng, and Yu Qiaqing will all remain unchanged. It was announced at noon today that Silby was elected as the Land Commissioner for 1939. Only one person was nominated by the registered land committee, so there is no need to elect the Land Commissioner.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Japanese Obstruction of British Ships Loading Pigs: Attempt to Monopolize the Fresh Pork Industry; Forced Loading of Passengers and Cargo with Extra Fees, Pig Traders Extremely Anxious Due to High Stakes <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese are attempting to monopolize the pork industry and exclusively control transportation. British companies Liddell Bros. &amp; Co., and Butterfield &amp; Swire have been weakened and obstructed. The Chiyoda Maru, represented by the Japanese company, Continental Products Company, forces the loading of pigs for Shanghai, with extra fees. Pig traders are extremely anxious due to the high stakes. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Obstruction of British Ships Loading Pigs</p>
<p>The British ships "Ma Lei Shu" of Liddell Bros. &amp; Co., and "Whang Poo" of Butterfield &amp; Swire, docked at the new port at 5:00 PM last Sunday to load 2,000 live pigs. A Japanese ship intervened, claiming that Japanese merchants had priority for transporting pigs from that location to Shanghai, and British ships were not allowed to overstep their authority. At the time, a Chinese worker on a barge was slightly injured by gunfire because he was slow to move. The aim is to obstruct British ships from loading goods in Chinese ports, monopolize the British shipping industry in China. However, the "Ma Lei Shu" reasoned with the Japanese and managed to load the pigs anyway. The "Whang Poo" also loaded eggs, fish, and other goods to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Extra Fees Opposed by Pig Traders</p>
<p>The "Chiyoda Maru," represented by the Japanese company Continental Products Company, forcibly loaded more than 1,000 live pigs at the Jiangbei New Port, which were originally allocated to the British ships "Kris Tin Ma Lei Shu" of Liddell Bros. &amp; Co. and "Wuchang" of Butterfield &amp; Swire, arriving in Shanghai yesterday from the new port. It unexpectedly charged an extra two yuan per pig on top of the customs duties, which pig traders unanimously opposed and refused to pay, resulting in inability to take delivery. Due to the prolonged delay, many pigs died or were injured on board, causing great anxiety to the pig traders due to the high stakes. The dispute is currently under negotiation and has not been resolved as of press time.</p>
<h3 id="e56">British Naval Personnel Awarded for Meritorious Service: British Ship Bombed in Wuhu by Japanese Planes, Crew Member Bravely Saved Many <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that in December 1937, when Jardine Matheson's ship "De He" (transliteration) was bombed in Wuhu, Yuan Changkai (transliteration), a first-class steward serving on the British warship "Gnat," with the guidance of British naval navigator Lieutenant-Commander Hurst, led the tugboat crew to rescue passengers and crew of the "De He." Yesterday (3rd), on the British flagship "Scorpion," Rear Admiral Holt of the Yangtze River Fleet presented him with a medal to commend his bravery. Last March, Mr. Yuan had already been presented with a silver shield medal by Jardine Matheson to commend his</p>
<p>brave actions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lieutenant-Commander Hurst was also presented with a silver cigarette case. On March 9th, he received the Distinguished Service Cross from Rear Admiral Holt on the "Scorpion." Among those attending yesterday's award ceremony were officers from the British Naval Office in Shanghai and the British warships "Cardiff" and "Scorpion." Rear Admiral Holt stated during the presentation that on December 5, 1937, when the British ship "De He" was bombed by Japanese planes in Wuhu, First-Class Steward Yuan temporarily gathered the Chinese crew of the tugboat "Qing Yang" (transliteration) to</p>
<p>assist to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Commander Hurst rescued many people from the burning ship, his actions were in accordance with the highest traditional regulations of the British Navy and are also a model for us. Because he established this achievement, the British King specially awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross. According to reports, when Japanese planes bombed the "De He," the ship caught fire and burned. Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Da Dong" (transliteration) was also severely damaged. At the time, the tugboat "Qing Yang" was docked next to the "Da Dong." The "Qing Yang" was also attacked but not sunk, but more than half of the crew were killed or injured, so there was a lack of navigators and it could no longer sail. Lieutenant-Commander Hurst of the British warship "Gnat" boarded the tugboat and sailed it away. First-Class Steward Yuan also temporarily gathered the crew to rescue the survivors on the "De He." The "De He" sank after burning, and the "Da Dong" was also holed and ran aground.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Spiritual Mobilization Conference: Most Encouraging Letter to Compatriots Published: Enhance Strong and Enterprising Spirit: Complete the Mission of the War of Resistance <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association was officially established on March 22 this year. Division of organizations has also been actively underway. The National Spiritual Mobilization Association for the industrial sector has also been established. Other sectors such as agriculture, business, vocational, and cultural sectors will also be established within days. The Shanghai Municipal All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association yesterday issued a letter to compatriots, encouraging the city's population to strive for six things, which are reproduced as follows:</p>
<p>Beloved compatriots of the entire city, since our supreme leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the country to announce the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, compatriots across the country have unanimously supported this great revelation by the supreme leader. The people of this city are even more excited. Everyone deeply believes that in this later stage of the War of Resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of material. To unleash the power of the War of Resistance, we must not only invigorate our mental outlook and concentrate our spirit, but also prioritize spirit over material, and by enhancing the strong and enterprising spirit of the nation, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat the tyrannical enemy. Now, in order to thoroughly implement this outline, the organization work of all sectors of the city is being actively promoted. We expect that in the shortest possible time, people from all sectors of agriculture, commerce, industry, and education will be able to participate in the unit of division organizations according to their respective occupational departments. On this day when the spiritual mobilization of our city begins, regarding the six things that must be paid attention to first in the spiritual life of the people, this association encourages all compatriots in the city to strive together.</p>
<p>Participate in Group Life</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the number of residents in the Special Zone has suddenly increased to more than four million. During the Songhu battles, regardless of men, women, old or young, either serving on the front lines or supporting the rear, everyone participated in organizations to resist the enemy and save the nation. After the retreat of the national army to the west, due to objective environmental restrictions, the work of saving the nation was decentralized, and everyone stood at their own posts and intensified their efforts. Now the later stage of the War of Resistance has begun dramatically. The difficulty and greatness of the task is a hundred times greater than before. Our compatriots must strengthen the power of resistance to closely cooperate with the situation in the later stage of the War of Resistance. Then the efforts of each standing at their posts is necessary to return to collective struggle. Now that this association has officially announced its establishment, organizations from all sectors will be established separately within days. We hope that compatriots from all sectors of the city will participate in the branch organizations of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors. Compatriots from the industrial sector participate in the branch organization of the industrial sector, compatriots from the business sector participate in the branch organization of the business sector, teachers and students from the education sector participate in the branch organization of the education sector, and compatriots from the cultural sector participate in the branch organization of the cultural sector. Other citizens, women, youth, etc. should also participate in the branch organizations of their sector. In short, every citizen must participate in the National Spiritual Mobilization Association and move towards the path of collective struggle.</p>
<p>Concentrate Organizational Strength</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang announced the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, some people in the city have automatically established organizations and tried their best to promote it. This is of course a very good phenomenon. Now that this association has announced its establishment, in order to concentrate our strength, we request that all established organizations participate in this association in order to avoid the drawbacks of differences and confusion in the negative aspect. In the positive aspect, we can concentrate all our strength and work hard for the great cause of resistance and construction. We firmly believe that this point will surely win the support and sympathy of all compatriots in the city.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Will to Resist</p>
<p>The later stage of the War of Resistance has begun dramatically. The enemy knows well that the future of the war of aggression will only lead to deeper and deeper mud, and the national strength will decline day by day. Therefore, the enemy's recent military aggression and political conspiracies closely cooperate, attempting to use their most tyrannical ferocity to threaten our spirit of resistance and shake our belief in victory. In fact, the military and civilians across the country deeply believe that the century-old blood debt between China and Japan must be fully compensated in this war of resistance. We are even more convinced that only by resisting to the end can we fight for the independence, freedom and equality of our country. Therefore, the enemy's bestiality and cruelty not only fail to threaten our spirit but also increase our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, not only fail to shake our will, but also strengthen the determination to not stop until we drive out the enemy. Our spirit of resistance must be developed during the period when the enemy's threats and oppression intensify us. Our will to resist must be strengthened and consolidated on this day when the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is launched. All peaceful air and compromise news created by the enemy and traitors must be absolutely rejected and thoroughly corrected.</p>
<p>Eliminate Fearful Psychology</p>
<p>Since the retreat of the national army to the west, although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the people of the city not only have absolutely no fearful psychology, but also the spirit of resisting the enemy and saving the nation is even more firm and enterprising, even more than during the Songhu War of Resistance. On memorial days, national flags fly in every household in the city. Even if they are subjected to unreasonable interference, they will not be threatened in the slightest, and there is no hesitation. However, precisely because of the indomitable and heroic resistance of March 29, the brilliant light filled our eyes, so that the enemy and traitors had nowhere to use their tricks. This great fearless spirit is precisely the expression of the national soul of the Republic of China, and it is also a strong guarantee that our country will surely win the final victory. There is no so-called danger, only danger has meaning, there is no so-called sacrifice, only sacrifice has value. Fear is just a tool of suicide, and resistance is the condition for victory. This is already an iron proof in the history of nations and countries of the world. There is no doubt that on this day when the National Spiritual Mobilization begins to be implemented, fearful psychology should be eliminated completely, and the spirit of great fearlessness should be promoted.</p>
<p>Promote National Spirit</p>
<p>During the period of more than a year since the national army retreated to the west, the Shanghai compatriots' love for the motherland has been seen by the world. Although the government's power has been insufficient, our compatriots have always obeyed the government's laws and regulations and respected the government's intentions. This great and noble national spirit has been shared by China and foreign countries. We hope that the compatriots of the whole city will further promote this national spirit in the future. If anyone, under the guise of special power, does things that violate the law and disrupt discipline, all revolutionary forces should be concentrated to give them the most severe sanctions, so as not to leave the slightest stain in this great and glorious history of the War of Resistance and National Construction.</p>
<p>Strengthen National Integrity</p>

Now, a rice shortage has occurred in Shantou and other places in Guangdong Province. After the chairman of the province telegraphed the Executive Yuan for relief, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has received a telegram from Chairman Li saying, "Four Chambers of Commerce, the various rice shortages in this province, according to requests for relief, now the Executive Yuan's electric, roughly says that foreign rice handled by merchants in this province is allowed to enter tax-free at 900,000 dan. Foreign exchange required for rice funds shall be raised by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the shipping merchants themselves. After the War Zone Food Management Office takes overall control, it will allocate imports. I am sending this telegram for your information, and asking the commissioners of districts 1, 3, 5, and 6 to inform the county magistrates.

<h3 id="e63">Upcoming Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings from Past Dynasties: Exhibit the Relics of Our Ancestors and Promote the National Spirit <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>More than 80 famous connoisseurs, art critics, philanthropists, etc. in Shanghai, in response to the Shanghai Physicians' Association's fundraising for medical relief, the preparatory work for the exhibition of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties has been completed after more than a month. It is scheduled to be previewed at the Daxin Company Gallery on the 10th of this month and officially open to the public on the 11th. The scale is grand and unprecedented. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fundraising for Medicine</p>
<p>The purpose of the exhibition is first to raise funds for medical relief. According to investigations, refugees in the inland areas lack medicine, and even minor injuries cannot be treated, and those who sacrifice themselves due to this are difficult to count. Enthusiastic people at home and abroad are concerned about the wounds and call for help, and try their best to raise medicine for relief. However, it is a drop in the bucket and cannot be sustained. The initiation of this association is to meet this need, and it is expected to raise 10,000 yuan, all of which will be handed over to the Shanghai Physicians' Association for transfer to legal organs as a medical relief undertaking.</p>
<p>Spiritual Food</p>
<p>The second purpose is to elaborate on the art of past dynasties in our country and express the great national spirit of our country. At present, the people of the isolated island are in a special situation, and their mental depression has reached its extreme. All they lack is proper appreciation. Exhibiting artistic masterpieces and commemorating the relics of our ancestors can strengthen our beliefs, encourage us to pursue the right path, and entertain ourselves, which is not the most important thing. Therefore, this exhibition is actually the most urgent spiritual food for the people of the isolated island.</p>
<p>Fine Works of Past Dynasties</p>
<p>The significance of the exhibition is so great that the current exhibition is jointly organized by major collectors, and the richness of the quality of the collections is unparalleled. Except for the London preview and the National Art Exhibition held by the state, it can be called an unprecedented grand event of a private group exhibition. Famous collectors Pang Laichen, Li Bake, Pu Xiyuan, Wu Hufan, Chu Minyi, Zhang Congyu, Liu Haisu, Pan Tingshan, Zhu Jinghou, Wang Jiquan, Xu Bangda, Lu Peizhi, Huang Zhongming, Lin Erqing, Pan Zixin, Zhu Qizhan, Ding Huikang, Yu Zicai, Hou Yehua, Qin Qingzeng, and other more than 30 families have hidden secrets that are not easily shown to others, and now they are all participating in the exhibition. There are more than 300 fine works from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, many of which are wanted to be seen by the outside world for a long time but cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>Selling Tickets</p>
<p>The price of each ticket for the association is one yuan in national currency. Now the Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, Daxin Company, and various newspaper offices, major bookstores, major companies, and major pharmacies have started to sell them on behalf of the association. The exhibition dates are from April 11 to 20. At 5 pm on the 10th, the opening ceremony and preview will be held. It is worth one yuan to see famous paintings and help medicine, which should be good news for enthusiastic people and art lovers.</p>

Your virtue is respected for generations, and you are a human treasure of the country."</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, morality, articles, and education, have contributed to our country, and his historical traces are brilliant and outstanding. The country respects the veteran and the world admires the well-known. On the 6th of this month, his 100th birthday, relatives, old friends, disciples, and old officials, especially held a grand celebration at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in this city, and used the birthday money obtained to help the refugees. Those who celebrate Mr. Shou celebrate the refugees. Mr. Yang Caoxian, a centenarian elder from Sichuan, is also one of the old friends of Xiang Weng. He is angered by his superb cursive writing skills and has traveled to various countries. He is welcomed by the government and the public, and the money obtained from gifting books is worth more than millions, all of which are invested in charity relief without any personal gain. Recently, he has returned from overseas to participate in the grand event, which is also a rare opportunity. Moreover, centenarians are not surprising, and centenarians celebrating centenarians are not surprising. What is surprising is that the two elders are the great elders of the world, and their knowledge and personality have moved the world. The centenarian host and the centenarian guest have never been heard of in the world's history of birthday celebrations.</p>

<p>The Pudong guerrillas held their second plenary conference for resisting the enemy in Pudong the day before yesterday (the 2nd) in Datuan, thanks to Yu Taosheng. More than 40 leaders attended, including Ma Bosheng, Ding Xishan, Xu Xinzhou, Fan Gencai, Yan Zeng, Gu Shouxin, and Gu Lifeng. Gu Lifeng served as the chairman, and all participants swore to remain steadfast and safeguard the territory. After the meeting, they went out to appease the people, post slogans everywhere, and issue earnest appeals to the public. At that time, the military and civilians rejoiced, quite similar to the enthusiasm of the Pudong people resisting the enemy during the initial battle of August 13th.</p>
<p>Ding Xueshan's Troops Advance</p>
<p>Ding Xueshan, commander of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Army, has been fighting the Japanese army in Pudong, Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties, erecting a strong line of guerrilla warfare to contain the Japanese army's activities. Currently, Ding himself has led more than 10,000 elite troops, actively advancing along the Jing-Hu-Hang (Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou) line. Their advance troops have already arrived at Xinzhuang, forming a large encirclement of Songjiang, coordinating with the regular army, which is advancing south from Jiaxing, to attack the Japanese army from both sides, and another route is advancing from Jinshan towards Pinghu, to strike at the rear of the Jiaxing Japanese army. Both routes have now reached their destinations. The Shanghai-Songjiang-Minhang highways are also under the control of Ding's troops, and guerrilla forces lurking in various places are awaiting orders to launch a siege and annihilation of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Huajing and Chegou Searched</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Japanese warship landed several hundred naval marines in the Guanhang town of Caoxing Township in Puxi. They then set up a perimeter and searched the vicinity, including the towns of Chegou and Huajing. The aforementioned Japanese troops also went to investigate. However, they found nothing.</p>
<p>Fanhangdu Sees Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>The Japanese garrison troops stationed in the Fanhangdu area of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway committed all kinds of atrocities, including raping women. After receiving repeated reports, the guerrillas took advantage of the cloudy and rainy weather yesterday morning (the 3rd), using a feint attack to lure the enemy out of their lair, and then divided a part of their force to strike the enemy's rear, catching them by surprise and launching a fierce attack. At this time, the Japanese troops were attacked from both sides and could not escape. They fought desperately, attempting to break through the encirclement. The two sides engaged in close combat, fighting fiercely for an hour. More than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and more than ten were captured alive. The remaining enemies fled in panic and were not pursued. The captured Japanese soldiers were immediately escorted to the headquarters. At that time, several passenger trains heading from Shanghai to Hangzhou were unable to proceed due to the intense fighting and returned to Zhabei.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Children's Day, April 4th. The weather was sunny and the climate turned warmer. The New World Department Store on Nanjing Road was unprecedentedly crowded. The company had established a donation platform in the department store specifically for this Children's Day, and the store was presenting Benevolence Medals. Anyone who donated two jiao of national currency to the fund for relieving refugee children could receive a medal. The results had been quite good in recent days. Yesterday, however, tens of thousands of people crowded around the platform, all vying to purchase medals. Some children donated all the money they usually spent on sweets, and some even brought their piggy banks, smashed them on the spot, and donated all their savings. The company has now preserved these broken piggy banks as a memento. The importance of cultivating a child's virtue of bravely doing good is indeed very significant. It is reported that yesterday, groups such as the Red Cross Society visited the company and praised the company's actions as being of great educational significance and its achievements as being particularly satisfactory. The company's use of these donations to benefit refugee children is certainly a very beneficial endeavor. Many people from all walks of life have not yet been able to participate due to other commitments, so it has been decided to extend the event for another five days, and the store will continue to present Benevolence Medals. We hope for enthusiastic contributions.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company recently donated 16,445 cans of sweetened milk to the International Relief Committee for distribution, which greatly benefits refugee infants. In a letter to the Committee, Mr. Montreux of the company stated that this was made possible through the cooperation of local customers and distributors. This donation was made possible by Chinese mothers who purchased the company's products to feed their babies, so Mr. Montreux's letter urged that this donation be used exclusively to provide to refugee infants. The Committee is now conducting a survey to determine the number of infants in local shelters. According to the latest figures, there are 1,575 refugee infants in the International Settlement and 525 in the French Concession.</p>

<p>According to the Chinese-language newspaper, North China Daily News, at around 8:30 AM yesterday (the 3rd), a 1,015-ton merchant ship of the Xiao Shipping Company (transliteration) collided with the Xingyu (transliteration) and the Hushan Maru (transliteration) of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company near buoys 28 and 29. The Xingyu was originally berthed at these two buoys, fully loaded with cargo, heading for Fuzhou. However, when raising anchor, the current was strong, forcing it to approach the Hushan Maru at the entrance and colliding with it. Six of the Xingyu's armored frames were knocked off, but the exact extent of the damage is not yet known. The damage to the Hushan Maru was minor. The Xingyu was severely damaged and will sail to the outer harbor for temporary repairs.</p>

<p>Tao Yunfeng, a local, started his career in the construction industry and accumulated a considerable fortune. He resides at No. 6, Lane 751, Kangnuot Road, Shanghai West. His son, Tao Zhangrong, is currently 40 years old. On January 24th, 1928, Tao Yunfeng married Guo Linzhen (32 years old), a woman from Pudong, to Zhangrong. However, since Guo entered the family, the relationship between the couple has been discordant, with frequent quarrels. Tao Zhangrong often abused her. His father, Yunfeng, ordered his daughter-in-law to separate from his son. Yunfeng paid her 20 yuan a month for living expenses. In order to ensure her livelihood in her later years, on July 15th, 1933, he enlisted Jin Hongxiang as a witness and recognized his daughter-in-law, Guo Linzhen, as his adopted daughter. He hired lawyer Zhuang Zhenfu to sign a contract, stipulating that if Yunfeng died of old age in the future, Guo could inherit her share of all his inheritance as an adopted daughter. By August 1936, Tao Yunfeng had died of illness. Unexpectedly, all of the inheritance was controlled by Tao Zhangrong, who firmly refused to divide the property with Guo according to the contract his father had made. Therefore, in 1937, Guo filed a lawsuit against her husband, Tao Zhangrong, in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court to divide the inheritance. After a trial, Judge Peng Shi ruled that Tao Zhangrong should hand over Tao Yunfeng's inheritance for division with Guo Linzhen. From then on, the couple's relationship became even worse, like ice and charcoal. Guo Linzhen moved to No. 10, Lane 177, Xinfengji Lane, Guizhou Road. Recently, Guo suddenly discovered that her husband had formed a relationship with a dancer named Chen Lizhen (from Suzhou, 20 years old), and they were cohabiting in the old house, acting as a cuckoo occupying a magpie's nest. It has been more than three months since then, and he treats his former wife as a stranger. Feeling unwilling, she reported to the Gordon Road Police Station on the 15th of last month, requesting an investigation. Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei and Detective Chen Shanji reported to the Special Court and obtained a search warrant. On the 17th, they rushed to investigate and found Tao Zhangrong and Chen Lizhen cohabiting in the same room. Therefore, they requested the Special Court to issue a summons, ordering Tao and Chen to appear in the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special Court for questioning yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the court to summon them. Both defendants failed to appear. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation and sued Tao Zhangrong and Chen Lizhen for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law, requesting a warrant for their arrest due to their failure to appear. Tao Guo Linzhen then explained the situation, stating that she would sue both her husband and the adulteress. Judge Dai approved the case to be rescheduled for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Case of Forcible Rape of Female Teaching Assistant: Xie Xiangsheng Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment; Xie Refuses Sentence and Prepares to Appeal <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Changzhou, 39 years old this year, used to be a class teacher at the Lagena Chinese Primary School established by the French Municipal Council, residing at No. 14, Jiyi Lane, Rue Poupard. In April 1937, he advertised for a female teaching assistant. At that time, Wang Jie, a girl from Liuhe, Taicang County, 20 years old but actually only 18, graduated from a rural senior primary school. Due to her family's poverty, she was unable to continue her studies. She came to Shanghai to seek a work-study opportunity to further her education. Seeing Xie's advertisement, she wrote to apply and was hired by Xie with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. Her job was to grade homework submitted by elementary school students in Xie's residence. Unexpectedly, about half a month after Wang started working for Xie, Xie forcibly raped her and then deceived her with promises of engagement and a formal wedding. He repeatedly raped her. Wang was physically weak and became ill due to the abuse. Unexpectedly, Xie issued an order to evict her, kicking Wang out without regard. At this point, Wang realized that she had been deceived and lost her chastity. She contacted Xie for negotiation but was ignored. Therefore, her mother, Wang Wu, as her legal guardian, accompanied Wang Jie and hired lawyer Qian Yuan to sue Xie Xiangsheng in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for offenses against morality, requesting that he be tried according to law. In the first instance, Xie Xiangsheng was found not guilty. Wang Wu and Wang Jie did not accept this and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. At that time, Xie was dismissed from the school and moved, making it impossible to serve the summons. The appeal trial was suspended. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Xie established a personnel trust office, advertised for applicants, and embezzled more than 500 yuan in guarantee money from the applicants. After being reported by the victims, the Public Concession Police arrested Xie and sent him to the First Special District Court for trial. As a result, Xie was sentenced to one year in prison. Xie did not accept this and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After investigation, the Third Branch of the High Court transferred Xie Xiangsheng to the case opening court and held a joint trial. Wang Wu had returned to her hometown and Wang Jie had gone to the political department of the Eighth Route Army, so neither was summoned. Only their agent, lawyer Qian Yuan, attended the case and declared the closing to Xie, scheduling the date of the verdict. All the circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the case was previously ruled, the original judgment was revoked, and Xie Xiangsheng was sentenced to six months in prison. It is reported that Xie expressed his disagreement with the sentence in court and declared that he would appeal. The court approved it, and Xie was sent back to the Second Branch of the High Court for review. (According to the embezzlement part, the First Special District Court sentenced him to one year in prison. Xie Xiangsheng disagreed and appealed. The appeal has also been concluded, the appeal was rejected, and the original judgment was upheld, as reported in yesterday's newspaper.)</p>

<p>There are now more than 40,000 refugees in the Nanshi refugee area, and the amount of food supplied to them every day is enormous. Recently, Xie Dabo, the French vice-consul and member of the Supervisory Committee of the area, entrusted Heng Dali (transliteration), a foreign comprador of Hengda Foreign Firm, and Su Weiguang, a Chinese comprador, to purchase 1,000 bags of yellow coarse rice as a precautionary measure. The rice arrived at the general office of the Nanshi refugee area the day before yesterday. The supply group found on the spot that hundreds of bags of the lowest quality coarse rice were mixed in, and there were quite a few flower stones, sand, and broken rice mixed in, obviously only seeking profit and disregarding the people's food. After Father Zhao, the person in charge of the area, learned of this, he was furious and sent Chief Director Gu Lun, General Affairs Group Leader Jiang Qanquan, and Inspectors Shen Yaoguo and Gu Qiansheng to negotiate with the firm with samples of the substandard rice, and secretly to investigate the rice merchants. It is now known that Gu et al. have obtained conclusive evidence and reported to Zhao. Based on the report, Zhao reported to the French Concession Police Department, and the Police Department sent detectives to the police station yesterday to summon all the witnesses for investigation according to law. Once the investigation is completed, lawsuits will be filed separately with the consulate and the court.</p>

<p>Recently, in various villages outside Shanghai, Japanese troops often disguise themselves as workers or villagers, ride automobiles to various places to scout for the whereabouts of guerrilla troops. Many of our loyal and brave men have been killed because of momentary carelessness. For example, on the 26th of last month, two farmers on Holberton Road were shot by disguised Japanese troops, one died and one was injured. Also, on the afternoon of the 29th, Zhu Qiusheng, the captain of the Fourth Independent Squadron, and Jiang Renqi, a member of the squadron, were killed in Zhanghongqiao. On the afternoon of April 1st, Zhao Fudi, the deputy captain of the Fifth Squadron of the Sixth Brigade, was stabbed to death with knives by disguised Japanese troops in Hejiabang Bridge. Unexpectedly, at around 1 PM the day before yesterday, five disguised Japanese troops went to the Wangjiazhai on Hongqiao Road, Shanghai West, and took turns raping Mrs. Wang Qian (23 years old, her husband is a teacher in a certain middle school, his name is being withheld). After the Japanese troops left, out of resentment and despair, she had thoughts of ending her life, so she secretly hanged herself in the room. By the time her family noticed, she had already died. Also, at around 9 AM yesterday, a farmer Chen, who lives in Linjia Lane, Zhongshan Road, was working in the fields when suddenly three Japanese troops (one of whom was wearing a blue coppersmith's outfit) disguised as workers staggered along and immediately took out a gun and shot Chen, hitting him in the right leg. He fell to the ground, but fortunately it was not a vital part and he was able to save his life.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Next Year's World Games Track and Field Events: New Standards Set for Preliminary Round Results; 30 Countries Already Participating as of February; Elimination System to Be Used for This Year's Yacht Race <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Finland) The International Amateur Athletic Federation has recently stipulated "New Standards for Preliminary Round Results" for the 1940 Olympic Games track and field events. Several of the standards are much stricter than those at the Berlin Games. Athletes must achieve the specified minimum score to qualify for the finals. The new standards for each event are listed below:</p>
<p>Event　New Standard　Berlin Games Standard</p>
<p>High Jump　1.87 meters　1.85 meters</p>
<p>Long Jump　7.20 meters　7.15 meters</p>
<p>Pole Vault　3.90 meters　3.80 meters</p>
<p>Triple Jump　14.50 meters　14 meters</p>
<p>Discus Throw　45 meters　44 meters</p>
<p>Javelin Throw　65 meters　60 meters</p>
<p>Hammer Throw　56 meters　49 meters</p>
<p>There is no preliminary round for the shot put; however, the competition will be held simultaneously in three locations. For the events with preliminary rounds, twelve athletes will qualify for the finals. If fewer than twelve athletes qualify for the finals, the remaining spots will be filled by selecting the athletes with the highest scores from those who did not qualify. For example, if only nine athletes achieve 65 meters in the javelin throw, the three athletes with the closest scores to 65 meters will qualify for the finals. To avoid excessively lengthy competitions in the high jump and pole vault, the International Athletic Federation Committee has established rules for increasing the height of the bar. The high jump will start at 1.70 meters, followed by 1.80 meters, 1.90 meters, 1.95 meters, 1.98 meters, 2.01 meters, 2.04 meters, 2.07 meters, and so on. Similarly, the pole vault will start at 3.60 meters, followed by 3.80 meters, 3.95 meters, 4.10 meters, 4.20 meters, 4.30 meters, and so on. The method of scoring for the yacht race was authorized by the International Yachting Conference held in London last year to be freely determined by the Finnish World Games Organizing Committee. It is reported that the yachting division of the organizing committee has decided to adopt an elimination system. All races will be held over seven days to determine the winners. Generally, boats with excessively slow speeds will be eliminated after four or five days, and approximately eleven yachts will compete in the final race.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Ticket Sales Are Booming <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Ticket sales for the World Games are progressing well. Ticket orders from various countries continue to arrive daily. According to estimations by the organizing committee based on requests and inquiries from various sources, the level of interest in the 1940 Olympic Games in Finland and other countries has reached a very high level. The Olympic Committees of countries such as England, the United States, and Sweden have also pre-ordered tickets from Finland on behalf of various sports associations in their respective countries. Domestic public sales have also begun. According to announcements from Finland, tickets will be sold through major international shipping companies and travel agencies. The deadline for ticket requests within Finland was February 20th, and a total of 200,000 requests were received. Of course, a large portion of these 200,000 requests will be rejected. According to special instructions from the ticket sales department of the Finnish organizing committee, those who placed their orders at the beginning of this year will definitely receive tickets, while those who ordered later may not be able to get them. At that time, the allocation of pre-ordered tickets will be adjusted based on the needs of each country. The ticket sales department also pointed out that orders must be placed using special pre-order forms, which must be filled out and returned to the designated agency for forwarding to Finland. Based on the orders received, the events that countries are most interested in are weightlifting, rowing, equestrian events, boxing, and gymnastics.</p>

<p>In our country today, science is needed for everything. Most people think that science, unlike other subjects, requires teachers to lecture and considerable equipment for practice to find a way to learn. Therefore, society recognizes science as aristocratic, closely related to money, as if impoverished youth, even if they are naturally close to science and most interested in it, have no opportunity to study science simply because of their poor family circumstances. However, from the perspective of the history of science, such ideas are not entirely correct. There are many opportunities for wealthy children to study science, but impoverished children are not limited by money and cannot enter its halls. The key is to work tirelessly and use it anytime, anywhere. Take Faraday, the great British electrician, for example. He was extremely poor in his childhood. He worked as a servant in a chemistry laboratory, but he was diligent in learning and asking questions, and always received instruction from Professor Davy. Later, he made contributions that shocked the world. Edison, the great American inventor, is known to everyone for his inventions in science that have benefited mankind, but he started as a poor child who could not attend school. He made a living by selling newspapers on the street. One of his ears was slapped by someone, resulting in lifelong deafness. Those who read his biography know his childhood and how he single-mindedly pursued science, eventually achieving unprecedented success and becoming a great man in history. From this perspective, Faraday still had the convenience of seeking instruction from others, while Edison did not even have that. He relied entirely on his personal struggle to achieve his goals. I have seen a small grocery store merchant in the United States who studies insects in his spare time and becomes a famous entomologist, writing extensively. A gardener became a botanist and later became a university professor. A servant in a museum became a geologist and paleontologist, and later became a senior technician at the museum. A servant in a chemistry laboratory became a chemical expert and later a university professor. There are countless such wonderful stories. European and American countries have benefited from science, and their universities and research institutes have indeed made great contributions, but the struggles of their impoverished youth from the lower classes have also been significant. Today, impoverished children in our country are advocating self-study. May they not hesitate in the face of difficulties and turn away from science!</p>
<h3 id="e97">Increased Use of Aluminum <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Huabao</p>
<p>According to the 1937 statistics on metal production, the production of aluminum increased more than other metals, indicating that the use of aluminum is rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>According to the statistics, from 1924 to 1937, the production of aluminum and nickel each increased threefold, and the production of gold increased twofold. The increase in the production of other metals was much smaller: copper increased by 74%, zinc by 66%, tin by 47%, iron by 42%, aluminum by 33%, and silver by only 6%.</p>
<p>Before the European War, the production of aluminum, calculated by weight, ranked sixth among metals, but by 1937 it had risen to fifth place. If calculated by volume, it would rise to fourth place, because aluminum is very light. The volume of one hundred tons of aluminum is equal to the volume of the following tons numbers of various metals: 266 tons of zinc, 270 tons of tin, 290 tons of iron, 327 tons of Nickel, 330 tons of copper, 389 tons of silver, 419 tons of lead, 714 tons of gold.</p>
<p>Calculated by weight, the aluminum produced in 1913 was 825 parts per million of the iron produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1924 was 2,486 parts per million of the iron produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1937 was 5,236 parts per million.</p>
<p>The increase in aluminum production is even more evident when calculated by volume. The aluminum produced in 1913 was 2,400 parts per million of the iron produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1924 was 7,230 parts per million of iron. The aluminum produced in 1937 was 152,30 parts per million.</p>
<p>If we compare the volume of aluminum and lead, the aluminum produced in 1913 was 230,800 parts per million of the lead produced in that year. However, by 1937, the production of aluminum exceeded the amount of lead produced, reaching 1,232,000 parts per million of lead.</p>
<p>If we compare the volume of aluminum and silver, the aluminum produced in 1913 was 39 times the silver produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1924 was 89 times the silver produced in that year. By 1937, aluminum was 251 times the silver.</p>

<p>— He Shan</p>
<p>Botflies are harmful to horses because their larvae parasitize the horse's stomach and intestines, causing various ailments, such as disrupting the function of the stomach, hindering digestion; absorbing nutrients from food, preventing the horse from getting adequate nutrition; blocking the pylorus of the stomach, obstructing communication between the stomach and small intestine; and larvae entering the large intestine and rectum, irritating the intestinal lining, causing the horse to feel distressed. This fly lays its eggs on the horse's hair, usually on the front legs and chest, using a type of liquid adhesive. When the horse licks the area with its tongue, the eggs enter the mouth and eventually reach the stomach. After about ten days, they hatch into larvae, causing the diseases mentioned above. This fly's instinct is to choose a suitable host, so its eggs are not laid on donkeys, mules, cattle, or sheep, but only on horses. It seems to have a thorough understanding of horses. Horses suffer from the pain and fear it greatly. They are not afraid of ordinary horseflies, only shaking their heads and tails to swat them away, but they become extremely frightened at the sight of this botfly, often running wildly into farm trees and shrubs to avoid it, as if they had entomological knowledge about this fly. This clearly demonstrates the animal instinct.</p>

<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>America is known as the Land of Gold, and gold and silver from all over the world flow to it. How it stores its vast wealth is something that people want to know. It is said that its gold is currently stored in the vault at Fort Knox. Its silver is stored in a reinforced concrete fortress-style silver vault on the grounds of West Point Military Academy, as shown in the picture, which can store silver bars worth 200 billion US dollars. The vault is only one story high, with walls one foot thick, fitted with steel doors weighing fifteen tons that are fireproof and drill-proof. Each corner of the building is equipped with a guardhouse, guarded day and night.</p>

<p>— Tai Gong</p>
<p>According to recent information obtained by the United States, Sweden is manufacturing an anti-aircraft shell containing a photoelectric tube that causes the shell to explode automatically when it passes its target. To destroy a bomber or render it combat ineffective, it is only necessary for this shell to fly close to it. This can be said to be a new threat to air raiders.</p>
<p>When the shell is in flight, a lamp inside the shell emits intense rays of light from many holes in the nose of the shell. When these rays of light hit the body of an aircraft, they are reflected into similar holes in the bottom of the shell, and concentrated by prisms and lenses onto a photoelectric tube. The current generated by this tube then activates a relay, connecting a circuit that causes the priming explosive to detonate. The detonation of this explosive causes the main high explosive, T.N.T., to explode—at which point the exploding shell can do the greatest damage.</p>
<p>This shell has a clever mechanism and can be used both at night and during the day. Its circuitry is appropriately adjusted to only respond to rapidly intermittent flashes of light, such as the intermittent light that it emits itself when rotating in flight. Therefore, only the light emitted by itself and reflected from the aircraft can cause it to explode; sunlight or other light cannot. If it misses its target and fails to explode, it will be detonated by a secondary fuse as it descends.</p>
<p>The light emitted by the anti-aircraft gun is reflected from the enemy aircraft into the shell, causing the shell to explode.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Hobbies <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Xia Ke</p>
<p>The mention of these two words brings to mind opium and mahjong. However, this article does not discuss these. I only wish to define the term "hobbies" and give an example of a hobby that everyone needs but that you would never guess for the moment, to prove the important relationship between hobbies and life.</p>
<p>The definition of hobbies has broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense: anything that can excite the spirit or provide a pleasant enjoyment is a hobby; in a narrow sense: anything that can improve appetite and aid digestion is a hobby. For example, tobacco, alcohol, tea, etc., belong to the broad sense, while all the sauces, vinegar, ginger, scallions, peppers, chili peppers, etc., used in cooking belong to the narrow sense. Although there is such a distinction, there is no strict boundary. The characteristic of hobbies is that they are easily acquired but difficult to get rid of. I still remember that a certain professor in the past liked opium and hated alcohol, listing the harms of alcohol in great detail, while another professor liked alcohol and hated tobacco, listing the harms of tobacco in great detail, but many students listening to the lectures did not avoid tobacco and alcohol as a result, but became proficient in both, surpassing their teachers in both, demonstrating the profound influence of hobbies.</p>
<p>People often think that hobbies are dispensable things, which is not necessarily true. I will now give an example of a hobby that everyone cannot do without, and that is the salt we eat. Those who have studied biology or physiology may say that salt is a necessary component of cells, so how can it be listed alongside tobacco, alcohol, ginger, and scallions and called a hobby? That's right, salt is a necessary component of cells, so there is salt in both plants and animals. The food we eat comes from the plant and animal kingdoms, so we have already eaten salt at the same time. I ask, is the salt that we eat—that is, the salt inherent in food and not added extra—enough for our use? In fact, it can be said to be enough. Haven't you seen shepherds adding salt to the grass before cattle and sheep eat it (modern pastures do add salt to the grass)? When tigers and wolves chase rabbits, no idle men would be so bold as to take on the job of sprinkling salt on the rabbits' backs. They do not feel a salt shortage, which proves that the amount of salt inherent in food is enough for use. Perhaps some people say that we humans are different. Fortunately, there is a low-salt diet in the treatment of tuberculosis, where no salt is allowed to be added when preparing food, which similarly proves this fact. Now it can be concluded that the salt inherent in food is necessary for our use and cannot be called a hobby, but the salt used in the kitchen for making soup and cooking is all extra salt, and its function is nothing more than to improve the taste of food, increase appetite and aid digestion, which is a hobby. Usually, the salt we talk about specifically refers to extra salt, which is the most common hobby. From a personal point of view, three days without salt is a matter of great anxiety; from a social point of view, the salt administration and the salt transport of Lianghuai in the past dynasties have been quite complex. We can no longer underestimate hobbies.</p>
<p>Suppose we actually became people of Wu-Huai and Ge-Tian, returning to the custom of eating raw meat and drinking blood. No matter if some people regard it as supreme happiness and others regard it as very boring, gradually there would be Du Kang, there would be Liu Ling, there would be Indians, there would be Columbus, and gradually foreigners would play mahjong and Chinese people would play poker. This is humanity's forte; the so-called salt of all things, is this one end of the spirit?</p>

<h3 id="e102">Finance: Hong Kong Traders Limit-Price Searching Buys, Cash Continues to Advance; Only Extremely Rare Variations Midday, Full-Day Range of Only One Dollar <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot Hsia-Chih market conditions continued to be high, already breaking through the 1070 yuan mark. This was truly because the potential of the Hong Kong exchange rate turned strong, leading to the Hong Kong gold price recently being higher than the Shanghai market gold price. Seeing the possibility of profit, Hakka traders entrusted a certain gold shop to search for and buy at a limited price. They also purchased in large quantities from a certain money exchange shop, and since the European situation is daily relaxing, people's hearts are more stable, so the market is firm and steady. However, in the midday market, money exchange shops, acting on behalf of regular merchants and hawkers, eagerly dumped at high prices, so supply and demand were equal, leading to extremely rare variations in the process. The result was a continued rise of four yuan, and trading was slightly more active than the previous day, approximately 850 taels. Silver shop jewelry gold did not see any changes. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to fall.</p>
<p>Hsia-Chih Spot Good for Four Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the gold shop initially bid 2072 yuan to buy, but sellers required 75 yuan before being willing to supply. Both sides directly held out until around ten o'clock before trading began. First, the gold shop took in 50 taels from the money exchange shop, with an opening price of 2073 yuan, four yuan higher than the previous close. After opening, another 50 taels were taken from silver shop and gang gold shops at the same price. Then, another 150 taels were taken from the money exchange shop, with the price still the same. After a while, another 50 taels were taken from the money exchange shop, with the price also at 73 yuan. Subsequently, because sellers were difficult to find, the gold shop forcefully took in 350 taels from a money exchange shop, with the highest price being 74 yuan and 5 jiao (it was said all were on behalf of Hong Kong traders to purchase). After this, supply and demand in the market were scarce, making it difficult to do business. The midday close was still at 73 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold shop first absorbed 50 taels from the money exchange shop, with the price at 72 yuan. Then, the money exchange shops did 50 taels among themselves, with the price at 72 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, the gold shop again took in 50 taels from the money exchange shop, with the price at 73 yuan. After this, the gold shop wanted to absorb more at a limited price of 73 yuan, but sellers all stopped selling to wait and see. Extended to the late close without seeing any business done, so the late close was still 2073 yuan. As a result, it rose four yuan compared to the previous close, with a full-day range of only one yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold selling price was 2080 yuan, and buying price was 2070 yuan, and spot mark gold was about 50 yuan lower than the brand name gold, but there was no business.</p>
<p>Silver Shop Jewelry Gold Still at Original Price</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry gold per tael for sale, because Hsia-Chih rarely changed, Da Tong Heng still hung the original price of 210 yuan, Xin Tong Heng was 208 yuan, buying in at 202 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Shrunk Another Penny</p>
<p>A London telegram from the 3rd stated that British pure gold shrunk another penny per ounce due to the slightly easing European situation and the good potential of the pound, with many accounts continuing to sell, reaching a retreat to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence. The central bank's Chinese cash buying price also fell to 1211 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold also fell 2 li, calculated as 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell 7 jiao accordingly, calculated as 1206 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday British pure gold fell one penny, British-American exchange rate fell two-five. The settlement of foreign currency at the port was very active, and the banks' intention to sell was smooth, so the market price was stable. The Hsia-Chih opening price, carrying forward the previous night's bullishness, tended slightly higher. Later, the supply and demand between the gold shops and money exchange shops was not strong, and the situation showed fluctuations. The daily changes were narrow, and the result was a slight rise. Foreign currencies, British, American, gold pounds, the rich slightly began to absorb, British and American gold notes, demand was still strong, Hong Kong notes, Chinese and foreign banks absorbed very smoothly, continued to show firmness, each currency saw mixed ups and downs, the trend fluctuated. The Association's trading was not smooth, Changtai sold and Hongchang bought shilling notes for 50 pounds, Huitong sold and Tongfeng bought American gold notes for 600 yuan, Fuhexing sold and Zhenxing bought French franc notes for 1000 units.

<p>The exchange market yesterday took on the gradual relaxation of the European situation, so the exchange rate between the British and the Americans turned higher again, so the initial opening showed British flat, American loose. Although Japanese merchants and foreign firms successively fiercely grabbed midday, the intention to supply was still strong from outside banks like HSBC, so the process was extremely rare in change, and the result was still British flat, American loose. Trading was still active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, initially, because Chinese banks fiercely grabbed, the tight trend was quite severe for a while. Later, because money exchange shops dumped cheaply, it slightly returned to firm, and in the end, it continued to soften by 0.125.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large bar recent terms retracted .0625, long terms unchanged, New York silver price remained stagnant as before, London gold shrunk a penny, exchange rates British to American rose a point nine, to French, to Shanghai were still flat, American to British rose two five, to French rose two five, to Shanghai a small point three, central listing exchange rates as before, the bank's morning opening selling price, British Exchange rate 8 pence two-five, American Exchange rate 16 yuan .09375, compared with the previous closing, the British flat American slack .03125, is the exchange rate between the British and American rose a point nine and two and a half, after opening although Japanese merchants and foreign firms followed in succession violently grabbing, but because HSBC still supplied as much as possible, so the shape was still quite stable, foreign banks settled in HSBC British Exchange rate 8 pence two-five, HSBC listing announced unchanged, and silver balance tax announced a drop of half a point, calculated as the levy of 4.50 percent, after which foreign firms again bought in and paid for Huabi American Exchange rate 16 yuan .0625, followed by the sudden unexpected force of Chinese banks to absorb Hong Kong Exchange rate without end, so the latent tendency gradually tightened, and then the selling meaning of money exchange shops turned strong, then slightly returned to hard, calculating the money exchange shops selling to Chinese banks, the Hong Kong Exchange rate from 55 yuan .375, returned to hard to half a yuan, until noon closing, the bank selling accustomed, British American two Exchange rates, were no different from the morning opening,</p>

<h3 id="e110">Yarn and Cotton: Taking Advantage of Customer Sales Development, Major Existing Yarn Dealers Return to Add Bets, 20-count Special Jincheng Already Reaches 400 Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yarn market prices trended upward. Although actual demand was not weak, the buying from Hong Kong and Shantou was not as enthusiastic as the previous day. The market sentiment took advantage of customer sales development. Buying power was still sufficient, so the momentum remained hot. The market situation saw another rise. However, some bulls, because the price was already 23-24 yuan higher than the low point, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line was affected by the war, making transportation impossible, the yarn sales still declined. Some sellers unloaded, but others said that the recent buying spree from Shantou was also for transporting goods to Jiangxi for sale, transported via the inland rivers of Shantou, but the travel time was very slow. Therefore, the bullish sentiment was extremely strong, and the market price rose and fell intermittently, up and down inconsistently. In the afternoon, the peak price of 20-count Special Jincheng reached 400 yuan. Tiannu was traded at 390 yuan. Then, as the buying wind subsided slightly, the market price immediately fell back.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Situation: At the opening this morning, because the previous day's rise had been strong, everyone predicted that there would be a slight correction. The customer side observed and did not make a move, so the opening price did not change. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was still 383 yuan. A short time later, the public said that a huge amount had been purchased for customer sales the previous day. Individual investors suddenly saw selling, falling by 2 yuan. Unexpectly, a certain colleague suddenly came in to buy. The Chaozhou-Shantou group ate dozens of bales of spot yarn, and then a buying wind was set off. The market price rose slowly, and mutual buying continued. By the time of closing, the highest price was 387 yuan. The mood was tight at the opening in the afternoon. There was another surge of 2 yuan, and Double Horse was 389 yuan, but it fell by 4 yuan in a moment, the price was 385 yuan. It is said that the buyers sold to take profits due to the high price, so it fell immediately. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,645 bales throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 2 yuan, Special Jincheng rose by 3 yuan, and others were flat. Chongxin Factory opened 2,600 bales of 6-count Dafa, the price was 300 yuan, for April-May delivery. Yong'an Factory opened 50 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng, the price was 400 yuan. The amount of each group's purchase is listed on the left: Colleagues: 665. Hong Kong: 225. Fuzhou: 55. Shantou: 385. Quanzhou: 10. Inland: 145. Yunnan: 125. Xiamen: 5. Tianjin: 30. Total: 1,645. The yarn market opened flat, rose in the middle, and then rose again in the afternoon. The momentum was still strong. Although the actual transactions were flat, the market price moved forward step by step, and the major dealers were all in a bullish position, so the pull was getting stronger. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue was 348 to 350 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Lanfeng was 344 to 346 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Rumors of the "Bankhead-Jones" Bill, Passed in Washington, Spot Cotton Prices in This City are Especially Strong, Four Yuan Higher per Load than Futures <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market fell in the early morning due to the drop in Liverpool telegrams and the sale by overseas cotton merchants. Later, it was rumored that the so-called "Bankhead-Jones" bill, which was produced by Smith's proposal for modification, had been passed in Washington. The content is that any farmer who voluntarily reduces cotton fields below the legal limit can purchase loan cotton from the government at a price of 5 cents per pound, for a total of 3 million bales. However, everyone expected that this bill would be opposed by the public. After passing through the House of Representatives, it will also be greatly revised. As a result, cotton prices rose by 6-7 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 points. Converted into legal tender, cotton prices all rose. US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 6 cents per load, Indian cotton rose by 3 and a half cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading remained extremely quiet. No transactions were heard from Chinese and foreign factories. Only the yarn price continued to rise. If it can rise again for a few days, the foreign cotton trading may still return to its old appearance. However, at present, various factories need to purchase spot goods very urgently, so the spot price on the market is especially strong, more than 4 yuan higher per load than futures, creating a special record, because there is a shortage of goods on the market. The foreign cotton futures prices yesterday, converted into ex-factory prices including tax, are listed below: Raw Materials, Category, Ex-factory including tax 60-count Egyptian cotton Superior: 104.75. Middle: 101.85. 80-count Superior: 39.80. Middle: 29.60. 20-count American Mite-Afifi: 83.85. Inferior: 70.70. 32-count Superior: 92.55. Inferior: 81.65. 42-count Superior: 94.35. Inferior: 82.60. South American Brazilian Cotton Superior: 88.15. Middle: 84.80. Inferior: 75.70. 10-count Indian Pingguoer: 62.15. 16-count Indian Omerla: 64.75. 20-count Indian Bailuoqu: 72.50. 24-count Indian Pengjiapu: 79.90. 32-count American Synt: 85.05. 31-count 42-count American Pengjiapu: 89.50.</p>
<p>Native Cotton Business: The local cotton business is becoming increasingly dull. Factories generally have no action because Indian cotton arrivals are increasing daily, and factory needs can still be supplied. However, the cotton is dry, astringent and uneven, so they also buy white package cotton for mixing and adjusting. In this way, the work can be smooth, and the color of the yarn can be beautiful. Therefore, although the business is light, the selling price is difficult to fall, in fact, because the goods are too scarce. However, Tongzhou cotton is slightly weaker by 5 cents, and the price of Huoji cotton is still not much different from the previous day. The source of goods from Subei is weakening. Only 400 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock. The current cotton situation is listed on the left: Huoji Cotton 70.50, purchased by colleagues, 200 bales, cash at the wharf. Haitijian 71.84, purchased by colleagues, 100 bales, cash at the wharf. Tongzhou Cotton 77.00, purchased by colleagues, 200 bales, remittance at the wharf.</p>

<p>Factory Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory spot flour market continued to rise. It was found that after the factory's actual sales to customers resumed uniformity, the purchases in this street gradually increased. Spot sales to foreign groups and inland areas were also not weak. However, the factory currently focuses on sales to the north, and does not accommodate retail sales, so the number of transactions has not developed specially. The total number of transactions in the city reached more than 40,000 bags. The second flour factory's price is still $4.40. It is heard that the factory's contracted imported wheat has arrived on another ship, and a large batch of imported flour has newly shipped to Shanghai, so the market is difficult to predict. It was found that 22,000 bags of flour were exported and transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Imported Flour</p>
<p>A new shipment was handled by Shunquanlong Foreign Company, amounting to a huge 260,000 bags. One theory is that it amounted to more than 160,000 bags. This cargo has already been imported and is being unloaded. The trading of spot imported flour on the market is still not deserted. However, the current float is small. Large dealers holding goods, in view of the new contract flour being difficult to allocate, successively adhere to their holdings, so the market is prospering. It is heard that the price of high-end brands has risen from 4.10 yuan cash to 4.15 yuan. The price of mid-range brands is 4.12-3 yuan, also up by 2-3 cents. However, a large batch of new arrivals have already arrived in Shanghai, so the market may still change.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>In terms of source, in addition to a new shipment of wheat contracted by factories, the arrival of local wheat is still lacking. Various factories are increasingly indifferent to the need for local wheat, and the market is lacking in both inventory and arrivals, presenting a situation of both supply and demand being deserted. As a result, the market has stopped again.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source of supply for various groups was still only He Xia No. 7. The Kunshan group and Changzhou group of the Soviet-Tong group arrived with a total of more than 2,000 packages by cart. The overall market: at the opening in the early market, it still appeared stagnant. Later, the local street began to move, and the situation gradually became lively. Subsequently, national customers also inquired slightly, and all selected the lower-priced goods in the middle range. As a result, the market showed a high and tight situation. As a result, except for the high price of thick and thin Japonica rice, there was no up or down, and the middle range and He Xia goods all showed several cents of improvement. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian remained level in terms of arrivals and sales, with no up or down. Bian Yuan has been slightly active recently, and the market price has been able to stand slightly.</p>

<p>Customer indica rice has been flat and tired for days, and the customer storage took the opportunity to absorb it. Yesterday, the customer group's Xinghang storage buying was particularly strong. The local street's various households continued to inquire, and the market price gradually rebounded after the morning market, ranging from 5-6 cents to nearly 10 cents higher than the previous market. The total number of transactions for the day increased to more than 4,000 packages, mostly collected by Xinghang. Wu indica rice opened at 12.7-8 yuan, and middle range goods also opened at 12.4-5 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market: The trend was not very changeable in the early morning because Dalian was still closed. At the opening, the market price of Dalian oil rose slightly by 1.5 cents, to 37.15 yuan. In the afternoon, it was rumored that there was a flexible solution to the issue of Dalian's controlled exports, which caused people's hearts to move. A part of the floating storage of profits urgently went out, and the market price immediately fell to 26.75 yuan. At the time of closing, it had already seen 26 yuan, down one yuan compared to the previous day's market price, with a total of more than 180 barrels traded. The other Lianqi also fell by a small amount, half a yuan, doing 30 pieces, the price was 33.5 yuan. Luhu was completed with 50 pieces, the price was 33 yuan, the marriage difference price was half, the previous day's market (26.5 yuan), 200 pieces were traded. The factory oil was still at 28.8 yuan, with 50 batches traded. Peanut oil also fell back, with the current oil falling by 5 cents and the futures oil falling by 1 yuan. It is estimated that 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened, the price was 31.5 yuan, and 50 pieces for April were completed, the price was 30 yuan. It was found that 80 pieces of raw oil came to Shanghai from Yantai yesterday, and 350 bags of beans, among the miscellaneous grains, were shipped from Tianjin yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market: The silk price was firm because the New York raw silk statistics revealed that both imports and inventories had fallen, and sales had increased compared with the previous month. The New York Stock Exchange's near-term rose by 6 cents, and the far-term rose by 4 cents, but the spot only rebounded by 1 cent. Yokohama silk prices, both spot and forward, rose by 25 yuan. The silk market situation seemed to have stabilized considerably.</p>
<p>This port's silk market: Because it had been extremely weak for several days, silk sales became active yesterday as soon as the foreign market improved. Yesterday, White Factory B character seven or eight parts was traded at 1600 yuan, 20 to 30 yuan higher than the previous day. Fengtai grade was 1590 yuan, French destination Yangzhou Unprocessed Silk 1580 yuan. Suna, Xinfu, Mitsui and other firms traded more than 100 loads, and the market sentiment was greatly boosted, so the consumers also expanded accordingly. White Factory B character sold 20 loads, the price was around 1550 yuan. If the market situation can continue to be active, it will not be difficult for the domestic and foreign silk markets to turn from weak to strong.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Piece Goods: East Goods Get Stronger, Qingdao Gang Covers Shorts in Shanghai, Huge Amounts Shipped to Sichuan and Yunnan, National Cloth Dyeing Factories Eager to Order Gray Cloth <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Sichuan-Yunnan group of National Cloth has been actively buying colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, printed satin, poplin and other goods for consecutive days, and continued to buy 4-5,000 pieces yesterday. The number of orders received was also large, but many were left in Shanghai due to insufficient cargo space on the ships. Yesterday, the rising trend of fine cloth and fine twill for white goods from the East was dramatic. In order to solve the problem of gray cloth supply for autumn and winter goods, printing and dyeing factories specially started ordering from various cloth factories at this time, but because the deadline was too far away, not many responded, and people's confidence was even stronger. The inventory of dark-colored goods such as serge, Zhigong, and thread flannel was increased by 2-3 cents per piece. Many batches have been traded by hoarders who intend to absorb them. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth pieces was uniformly increased by 10 to 25 cents per piece. The Guangdong group bought more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and printed goods, and the purchases from this street and various guerrilla areas in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were very vast. However, there were few white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill. Affected by the East goods, the selling price became slightly stronger. More than 200 pieces of fine twill used for filling dyeing defects were purchased by various dyeing factories. 30-40 pieces of fine cloth were purchased by the Zhejiang-Fujian group, all of which were original plates. The Yantai group in the north purchased a total of 1,000 pieces of 16-pound coarse cloth last week, and there is no intention to continue purchasing, so the market has also turned flat. This street continued to have small-amount transactions.</p>
<p>Because of strong sales in the north, the Qingdao group covered shorts in Shanghai for fine cloth and twill from East China, with the needs for the fine cloth of Longtou and Caiqiu brands being the strongest. The market price rose due to the increased purchases, and fine cloth rose by another 3 cents per piece, and fine twill rose by 15 to 20 cents. It was also heard that Japanese manufacturers directly shipped and sold to the Nanjing-Wuhu area, with huge amounts shipped out, making the market even tighter. The color cloth Yuhao in this street also rose to search for goods, so yesterday's customer sales were about 1,500 pieces, and this street also accounted for more than 1,000 pieces. Taking advantage of this opportunity, various firms ordered a thousand pieces of fine cloth. The peak price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened from 12.4 yuan to a peak of 12.65 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric trading was still lively, and the retail and tailoring business for making Chinese clothing was also smooth. The business of Western clothing groups was busy in all places except for Daxin Street, which did not show special improvement. The market price, both officially and unofficially, was strong, mostly seeing only rises and never hearing of declines. Among the colleagues, the intention for ordering autumn and winter goods in the second half of the year suddenly became active, and many people selected British and Italian goods. It was heard that all autumn and winter goods in the range of 4 shillings and above to 6 shillings and below were ordered particularly strongly.</p>

<p>Yesterday's imported sugar market continued to rise. The association's price was 25.15 yuan for Dutch coarse white ex-warehouse, and 25.25 yuan for local ex-warehouse, both up by 5 cents. Big Money brand was 25.55 yuan, transit goods were 17.05 yuan, and 200 bags were traded. Newly arrived goods were even tighter, calling up to 17.3 yuan. Taikoo refined white also rose by 2 cents, Western ex-warehouse was 25.25 yuan, and 200 bags were traded. HX brand was 24.65 yuan, 50 bags. Released for sale were June Dutch coarse white (Dutch guilder) at 8.4 yuan, July-August at 8.3 yuan, September-December at 8.05 yuan, and 800 tons were traded. Taikoo sugar in May was Hong Kong dollars 9.75 yuan, and 8,000 bags were traded, and the current month was 9.65 yuan, and 2,000 bags were traded. National Sugar Company: Transactions were still scarce.

<p>Tin foil: Digestion was particularly strong during the Qingming Festival, with smooth sales in both wholesale stores and to inland customers. However, because the price from the producers in the Shao group was not loose, the cost was high, so the foil merchants convened a temporary meeting yesterday, proposing to raise prices. It was decided on the spot to increase the retail price by 2 cents per piece, and the whole roll would be increased by 1 to 3-4 cents, and it was decided to sell at the newly negotiated price from yesterday.</p>

<p>The production of new Jianjiao is very poor, with an annual situation of only about 20%, resulting in rising prices in the Min market. It was found that the lowest production price was 140 yuan, and recently it has risen to 190 yuan. The Shanghai quotation must be 240 yuan.</p>

<p>The selling price of dark plum in the previous market varied. For example, the price of superior goods from Shangzhuang with dry bodies and solid flesh was 14-15 yuan per load, and inferior goods were 11-12 yuan. But now that the sales season is approaching, the number of inquiries is increasing daily. It was found that inland inventory is still plentiful, and the first batch of 3-400 pieces has been prepared to be shipped to Shanghai, hoping to wait for the right time to sell.</p>

<p>Because the production of sand ginger was not abundant last winter, the new goods that were shipped to Shanghai were opened and sold as soon as they arrived, with no accumulation. Recently, the Tianjin group and this street have been demanding quite a lot, so the price has also been rising step by step. It is estimated that from 25 yuan to 27-28 yuan, the market price is now 30 yuan, and the future market has already called for 32 yuan, but the production price near the city is as high as 20 yuan, up 3 yuan from before.</p>

<p>Since the Tianjin group purchased new lead wire, spot goods are now felt to be tight, and the factory output is still scarce, so the circulating goods on the market have a situation of supply not meeting demand. The market price is rising. It was found that hundreds of loads were traded yesterday, and the selling price was increased by 1.4-5 yuan compared to the previous price. For example, No. 21 to No. 25 was sold for 29 yuan, and a single No. 25 could be sold for 31-32 yuan. Coarse flower color was sold for 25.5 yuan, and mid-range goods were opened for 23.5 yuan. However, because the inventory is weak and there are many people who need to purchase, the market is unusually prosperous.</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Decline of Fascist Countries <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>Recent international events clearly demonstrate the decline of fascism.</p>
<p>Take the more advanced Italy. Its demands on France, though significantly scaled back, omitting territorial concessions and only seeking improved transit access to the Suez Canal and Djibouti port, along with better treatment for Italians in French Tunisia, have been met with France's refusal to cede an inch of land or grant any rights. Helpless, Italy has yet to take any action.</p>
<p>Next, consider Germany. Just a dozen days ago, it was rampaging through Central Europe, threatening to engulf all smaller, weaker nations. However, upon Britain's declaration guaranteeing Poland and forbidding aggression, Germany was forced to retreat and shelve its demands for Danzig. Although its leaders issued a speech to justify themselves, the interrupted broadcast revealed their confusion, and the words, as Londoners noted, only "confused us, not made us more troubled." The effect was predictable. This wasn't Hitler's attempt at mystification; it was, in reality, unavoidable.</p>
<p>Finally, there's Japan. It repeatedly saber-rattled over fishery issues with the Soviet Union, vowing never to compromise. Now, the interim fisheries agreement is complete, and Japan has gained: a 10% increase in rental fees; the return of 27 key fishing grounds to the Soviet Union; and participation in the auctions it opposed.</p>
<p>Why have these fascist countries become so arrogant initially, only to become deferential later? Have they achieved enough and feel content? Are they repenting and not going too far? Do they truly see the need to maintain world peace? No, no, none of that is true! They have encountered genuine resistance and have no choice but to back down.</p>
<p>Their consistent tactic has been to use intimidation and sow discord. In the past, they were able to operate freely and enjoy themselves because democratic nations didn't understand their nature, or, even if they did, lacked a resolute stance or coordinated action. Now, democratic nations have awakened and changed course. Their tactics of intimidation naturally fail.</p>
<p>Past events should inform future actions. If democratic nations uphold this spirit and continue to stand firm, the ultimate decline of fascist countries is inevitable.</p>
<p>China's 21 months of resistance exemplify this spirit of defying threats and resisting division. Therefore, our enemy, one of the fascist states with great ambitions for us, will inevitably face its day of ultimate decline!</p>
<h3 id="e127">Rebellious Sons and Daughters <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Purple Gold</p>
<p>Before I went abroad, in Shanghai, I often saw a group of "big black men" from the territory of Durian at XX University. They were fierce, extravagant, and simple-minded, only knowing about money, cars, foreign houses, and Suzhou women... No matter the matter, big, small, black, or white, they would solve it with "crude fists." Each of them was like the "Grape" Moulis depicted by the French Louis Le Prince, three sentences not agreeing, eyes wide open, and immediately:</p>
<p>"Damn it!" A swarm rushed forward, "Hit him!"</p>
<p>In restaurants, in places with hurried and complex music, they often used alcohol to fight and get angry, staging a "Trojan War" for "sea transport." Or, if a professor didn't give them passing grades, it wasn't uncommon for them to pull out a knife to threaten him. Like this, the impression that this group of "big black men" gave people was certainly very bad. Many people even thought that everyone who grew up on the equator was this type of "only child." To put it bluntly, they were "changed things"! However, this is a big mistake, just like a group of scholars praising Shakespeare out of context. If a person has been to the equator and gotten their "overall impression" of them, then they will feel it this way.</p>
<p>The equator is hot, the grass is always lush, and the sun burns like fire all year round. And the Chinese sons and daughters on the equator are also so passionate, burning like fire: frank, brave, and vigorously advancing. When China, like a giant, rose up to defend against the tyrannical enemy, their strength was displayed even more fiercely and greatly, a darkness that penetrated the entire equator: "For the country," they decisively dealt with those who were afraid of airplanes and cannons, saying: "Fear the island!"</p>
<p>Language is their action. From Burma, from ____, from the British Malay Peninsula, from the Dutch colonies..., reserve forces flowed to suffering China in waves. In the Anti-X Military and Political University and the Shaanbei Public School, in the rescue teams, on the dusty battlefields, where was there not a trace of them? The following poem by the English poet Browning is forever worth boasting about by the Chinese sons and daughters on the equator: "I was ever a fighter, one fight more, The best and the last!" In the world, dark demons flap their wings, wreaking havoc everywhere. In J, a "bizarre" thing once happened: a middle school girl, determined to join the army, left her parents and returned to China by ship with two like-minded "big black men." When the ship arrived at ____, her relatives telegraphed the customs to detain her and the men, and then escorted them home. A group of "____" feudal remnants, wearing Taoist robes and makeup, all helped to make trouble: "Abduction and elopement, no! Sue them!" The "unjust emperors" in the newspaper offices also acted as if they knew everything, writing loudly in the newspapers: "Morals are declining, falsely enlisting in the army, seducing women to elope!"</p>
<p>After that, somehow, the two "big black men" were fortunately not "sued" and returned to China freely. But the middle school girl was locked up by her relatives, like the girl Psyche in Greek mythology who was imprisoned by ____ in a lonely tower, unable to move a step on her own. Even if their daughters have been domesticated into the kind of woman described in the "Goddess Fu" who is "accustomed to being quiet and secluded, far from the world," what use would they have in this era? This is a question. Parents, who were originally "stepping stones" for their children, treated their children as a swarm of flying and scurrying caterpillars, sighing to the sky: "Caterpillars, are they not afraid of being beaten to death by the XX people? Alas! Rebellious sons and daughters!"</p>
<p>However, the truth is that the XX people were stung to death by these caterpillars!</p>

<p>"Arise! Those who refuse to be slaves..."</p>
<p>Songs, flags, waving in the sweet spring breeze. The gentle sunlight shines on us walking on the shore - a small team, winding and twisting, advancing along the unfamiliar path!</p>
<p>Although we have been traveling for four days, we do not slack off in our work. The spirit of unity is becoming stronger and stronger. Each face, tanned black by the sun, shows a pair of stunned eyes. Three female comrades are even braver than us, distributing leaflets for national salvation along the way, singing "Women's March," causing the busy farm women to stop their work and listen to the sweet singing.</p>
<p>We are almost near the sea, seeing the outline of the opposite shore (Hai Mountain). We are happy, and at the same time, our stomachs are rumbling, reminding us that we will return to the sea tonight to perform a play; and we also think of the enthusiastic welcome from the local office, and the delicious food. We must do our best in the performance.</p>
<p>"Stop! Give the last performance in this place in front of this small house." The principal's serious face faced us, and pointed at me holding the flag, meaning for me to prepare. Everyone started working separately: applying makeup, borrowing tables and chairs, beating gongs and drums, busy for a while. The men, women, old, and young in the village all came, forming a circle. The children waited with laughter.</p>
<p>After I briefly reported the latest battle news from the various battlefields, a female comrade began to explain the plot of "Put Down Your Whip" and the other two short plays, so that they could easily understand. In this way, the play began.</p>
<p>After one act, we also interspersed speeches, singing, and individual Q&amp;A, so that they would not feel the time was too long.</p>
<p>A total of three short plays were performed. They enthusiastically requested another act, so we bravely performed the stage play "Beat the XX Ghost." Some of them were in tears. They were really too moved by the characters in the play; especially those farm women, who were even more sympathetic to the farm woman in the play!</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and a gust of sea breeze, along with a burst of enthusiastic applause, sent us to the sailing ship. We responded to them with a majestic song:</p>
<p>"Mobilize, mobilize, mobilize the whole country..."</p>

<p>— Xiao Guang</p>
<p>The relationship between people and society is built on mutual aid and compassion. I very much believe in this sentence; but many facts that I have heard and witnessed make me doubt this famous saying.</p>
<p>For example: if someone falls on the road, the people on both sides will clap and laugh. A villager who has just arrived in the city and is not used to the road is hit by a car driver and almost loses his life; but the driver will not stop the car to help him up, but will scold him loudly, "You're asking for death!"</p>
<p>A small ____ three standing by the road catching lice, people will give him a contemptuous look. A disabled person, without feet, runs on the road, crawling hard with both hands, people do not feel tragic when they see it, but will cause a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Everyone feels that robbers and thieves are hateful, and everyone will scold them. In fact, the nature of thieves and robbers is not necessarily bad, but the inadequacy of the entire social system that causes their inadequacy? Moreover, no matter what, their behavior is much better than traitors who betray national interests.</p>
<p>Humans should have passion, have a "heart" of compassion and mutual aid, except for those who are truly "unforgivable."</p>
<p>Today's Chinese people, everyone should show great compassion, but undoubtedly, this compassion has a sense of justice. Because the heart of being happy for the happiness of others and sad for the sadness of others is commendable, but it cannot be given to the enemy to fuel their ferocity, otherwise justice will be reduced in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Anti-War and Poetry <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ting</p>
<p>Why was poetry particularly developed in the literary world after the Three Kingdoms period? Perhaps because the world was in great chaos, and the writers and writers were either on the battlefield or displaced, they no longer had the time to bury themselves in their desks and write longer texts. However, even in that chaotic era, people's emotions did not disappear, but grew more special, full of tragic and generous enthusiasm and lingering and affectionate sadness. Therefore, this short and rich emotional poetry was greatly used and developed. Now, the whole country is fighting against the war; a great era has been opened. The literary world is arguing about the question of "why there are no great works yet"; I do not think so, I think this should be an era of great poetry creation.</p>
<p>According to the editor of a certain supplement, the number of poems accounts for a very large proportion of the manuscripts received by literary and artistic publications, which is also the reason; but each publication (of course, except for poetry publications) is restricted to the form of poetry accounting for one-eighth of the entire manuscript, and writers are also restricted by this, so poetry cannot be expanded. This is also the reason why modern poetry is not as developed as it was during the Three Kingdoms period.</p>
<p>We know that poetry is not worse than other literature and art; on the contrary, it is more convenient to write and has more emotional power. In our country, writers are naturally like the writers of the Three Kingdoms period, either on the battlefield or displaced, and even if they are temporarily settled, they are trapped in the format of ____ writing, making fierce attacks on enemies, traitors, and all corrupt elements, or popularly explaining the meaning of the war of resistance to the public. Therefore, although there are good subjects, there is no spare time to engage in the creation of great literature and art. However, the creation of poetry is still not hindered; the short form is rich in emotional expression. If these publications can break the one-eighth format, poetry will undoubtedly fly and progress.</p>
<p>Singing the greatness of the great era is now!</p>

<h3 id="e133">Interesting Anecdotes from the Film Actors' Troupe's Journey to Sichuan, Silver Star Clothing Becomes the Object of Imitation, Sichuanese Men and Women Young People Make Big Jokes <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Ren</p>
<p>The large team of film artists, after the Anti-Japanese War, was organized under the "Shanghai Film Actors' Troupe," relying on the past screen prestige, marched into Sichuan, performing national salvation dramas. At that time, it was a warm sensation in Chongqing and Chengdu, and was greatly welcomed by the audience; at the same time, in the aspect of national salvation work, it was also a powerful propaganda with great effectiveness. They stayed in Chengdu the longest; until now, there are still many people doing long-term public performances. In light of this, when they first arrived there, many young men and women in the local area followed the figures of this great era fleet step by step, imitating everything; especially in terms of clothing, which caused a lot of interesting stories.</p>
<p>Barefoot Leather Shoes</p>
<p>Bai Yang, Liu Liying, and other female stars, at that time, because the autumn heat had not subsided, many people still showed their seductive jade feet, barefoot in leather shoes, without socks. The women of Chongqing, because the world of red eyes was newly opened, took off their ____ in succession, competing to show off their fashion. Some even went further, and some fashionable women wearing ordinary shoes also did not wear socks, and quickly formed a temporary fashion.</p>
<p>Pom-pom Hat</p>
<p>A kind of child-style hat with a large pom-pom on top was originally used as a ____ hat by some male actors in the guest house. One day, someone went offstage after a performance and accidentally wore this hat to the theater a few times, and many young audience members thought it was the new popular style in Shanghai; in a few days, the city of Chengdu saw people competing to imitate it, and it became popular for a while; the young people on the streets, wearing such a hat, the colors of the hat were red, green, light, and dark, all kinds were available, which was a spectacle. The hat shops in the city also rushed to meet the market demand, and each hat was priced as high as two or three yuan, and the supply was still less than the demand, which was really an extra good business.</p>
<p>Ribbon Hair Tie</p>
<p>Bai Yang once went to a photo studio to take photos. Because she didn't have any new costumes, she suddenly had a wonderful idea and took off a belt from the velvet coat she was wearing and used it as a ribbon on her head. The large velvet balls at both ends of the belt slanted at the corners of her hair, and the appearance was also very distinctive. Later, the photo studio displayed this photo in the glass cabinet on the street, which immediately attracted the attention of many women, and everyone was busy dressing up in the same style, which became a very popular new ____ style. Even more laughable was Shi Chao's "wife" Zhuo Manli, because she wanted to take her coat belt, and the weather was cold in winter, she was still wearing a thin cheongsam. Shi Chao had no choice but to let her wear his upper garment to keep warm temporarily. Unexpectedly, once the local women discovered it, they thought it was also a very new and fashionable dress, and they all blindly followed it, not letting Zhuo Manli be the only one beautiful.</p>
<p>Wearing Cheongsam Outside</p>
<p>Similar jokes like this, in the two places, really caused a lot of trouble, to the extreme. From this point of view, the power of the film artists performing national salvation dramas is a clear counter-evidence.</p>

<p>Thirteenth Sister Honors New Year Gengyao Respects Teacher</p>
<p>In fact, discerning people knew long ago that Nian's cruelty, love of killing, arrogance and extravagance would not end well, but no one expected that he would be dealt with so quickly. It can be seen that "a tall tree attracts wind, and great power attracts jealousy" is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Nian Gengyao's character was so brutal, but he was extremely respectful to his teachers and elders, never daring to be negligent. In Tongshan County, Xuzhou, there was a Mr. Li, a Kangxi Zhuangyuan (top scholar), who had served as a chief examiner. Nian Gengyao was a Kangxi Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examination), and Li Pingyi was considered his teacher. According to local elders, Nian Gengyao always accompanied his teacher for meals. During the meal, he always watched the teacher. If he saw that the teacher liked to eat a certain dish, he would order the servants to move it in front of the teacher. If there was a grain of sand in the rice that was not cleaned, the general would glare at the servants, and the cooks would immediately suffer. One day, the cook presented a dish, and after the teacher tasted it, he found it extremely delicious, and almost emptied a small plate. Therefore, it was always presented every meal. The teacher asked what the name of this dish was, and the attendants replied "Little Tofu". One day, the dish was suddenly not seen among the dishes. The teacher was displeased and ate half a bowl less of rice. The cook was afraid of being punished by the general, so after the meal, he hurried to apologize to the teacher, saying: "These days, 'Little Tofu' is out of stock, please forgive me." The teacher was even more unhappy and said, "Tofu is not something valuable, how can it be out of stock? Isn't this obviously lying to me?" The cook was forced to tell the truth, taking the teacher to the alley in the kitchen, where he saw ducks piled up like a mountain. Pointing at these things, he said to the teacher: "The 'Little Tofu' that you eat every day is all stir-fried 'duck brains' and 'duck tongues'. It takes slaughtering several ducks a day to stir-fry a small plate. The general was afraid that if he told you in advance, you would not bear to eat it, so he always said it was 'Little Tofu', to make you happy, so you would eat well, and the general would be happy, and we would not only not be punished but also rewarded. These days, it is really difficult to find so many ducks, barely able to put together a plate to present, so it made you angry." The teacher listened, repeatedly sighed, and was so frightened that he couldn't speak for a long time. After a while, he said to the cook: "I didn't expect to eat such a big sin. From today on, I will never eat it again."</p>

<h3 id="e142">'Sweeping the Tomb' vs. 'Sweeping the Demons' <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>The Qingming Festival is approaching, and soon it will be time to sweep the tombs, using incense, flowers, and candles to express our remembrance of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Although the Qingming season for sweeping tombs will arrive, what about our mourning huts (where one lives by the tomb)? Reading the line "Do not raise the dust in mourning robes, it is still possible to go home by Qingming", I can't help but shed tears!</p>
<p>What about our mourning huts? The tombs may have already collapsed, or become factory ruins! The demonic shadows of warmongers loom, baring their fangs and claws, seizing our fertile fields, burning our houses, raping and killing our compatriots, or even creating a vast burial ground to bury China alive, and slaughter our 450 million compatriots.</p>
<p>Each of us probably has a "personal tomb" around us. This tomb is created by the enemy, are we really going to walk into it? However, my heart aches! If I were to speak in a sentimental tone, of course it would be: "I was born at an inauspicious time, facing this crisis!" However, sentimentality is unnecessary. Although the "crisis" has given us "this", my life is actually very "present." Using my "present life" to save the "crisis" of "this", then even if the enemy tries their best to build burial grounds, they will not be able to pull out their own muddy feet, or at least they will only be able to deposit their own packages of "ashes".</p>
<p>Based on the above meaning, it seems that for the current Qingming Festival, it is not necessary to "sweep" the ancestors' "tombs", even the "remote offerings" or "remote sweeping" where souls faintly come to enjoy, as well as "representative delegation" style "sending incense" and "sending offerings" etc. can be omitted. If the ancestors truly have spirits in heaven, then at this moment of "national collapse and disintegration," they should at least understand the hardships of their descendants resisting the enemy and saving the nation, as well as the severity and urgency of all the sufferings that all living beings are enduring. Would they want their descendants to be distracted by "incense, flowers, candles, invitations to mourn and sigh" and slacken their efforts to serve the country, leading to "those close to us grieving, and the enemy rejoicing"?</p>
<p>Not sweeping the ancestors' tombs will not cause the ancestors to "become zombies". Not sweeping "our own tomb" will only embolden the demons and monsters to intensify their tricks and harm us. In this dark space where demons loom, if we don't fight to reclaim ourselves, how much of ourselves will be left?</p>
<p>Therefore, we must thoroughly examine "our own tomb" and find a way to remove and sweep clean the tomb that others have built for us.</p>
<p>Recently, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, wrote an article on "Seven Famous Deep-Rooted Diseases". According to her, the deep-rooted diseases are: (1) factionalism, (2) lack of self-control, (3) evading responsibility, (4) self-abandonment, (5) being careless, (6) jealousy, and (7) narrow-mindedness. Finally, she hopes that all 450 million compatriots will issue the resolute cry of "I will be reborn," and use this voice to evolve into power, arouse action, and create the "revival of our Chinese nation".</p>
<p>The "Seven Famous Deep-Rooted Diseases" are seven famous demons that haunt the bodies of each individual, and at any moment there is a possibility of constructing "their own tomb". If we don't find a way to sweep them away completely, we will not only fail to live up to our distant ancestors, but we will also fail to continue to grow ourselves. Moreover, the external demons lurking around us will take advantage of the opportunity of these internal demons constantly entangling us to bare their fangs and claws, devour us alive, and lead us to death, placing us in an irrecoverable abyss. Then we won't even have time to sweep "our own tomb", let alone the tombs of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Moreover, "The object of our filial piety today should be the entire nation, and we should strive not to fail our nation's common ancestors. We should always remember the beautiful rivers and mountains created and painstakingly managed by our ancestors who shared joys and sorrows for hundreds of generations and left to us—"</p>
<p>Now, many of our beautiful rivers and mountains are scorched. Therefore, changing "sweeping the tomb" to "sweeping the demons" is the most urgent and pressing task at hand. Displaced people, if you have not forgotten the beautiful rivers and mountains that our ancestors painstakingly managed and left to us! If you still want "I will be reborn"!</p>

<p>In previous years, around Qingming Festival, we would see advertisements in the newspapers from various guilds or associations urging people to "transport coffins back to their hometowns," but this year is an exception, we don't see them. Originally, in "isolated island" Shanghai, even if you wanted to transport a coffin back, it would be very troublesome.</p>
<p>Guilds and associations are, in fact, two entities that are one and the same. If you must distinguish between them, then guilds handle charitable affairs to benefit fellow townsmen, while associations are specifically for storing coffins. In terms of authority, it is also three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional, because associations are under the management of guilds.</p>
<p>Originally, of course, guilds came first, then associations, and most guilds and associations were together. Therefore, even now, in terms of name, many people still don't distinguish between them. Guilds are somewhat like foreign guilds, the so-called "trade associations." Probably after the opening of trade, Shanghai rapidly prospered, and merchants and workers from various places came to Shanghai. To seek the welfare of fellow townsmen or colleagues, they donated some money and organized guilds of the same nature as trade associations.</p>
<p>In general, guilds initially purchased land with the donated funds they raised. At that time, even in the concessions, there was wasteland everywhere, not yet as prosperous as it is now, so land prices were very cheap. But later, roads gradually expanded year by year, the market became more and more prosperous, and land prices rose at an astonishing rate. The value of the land purchased by the guilds also became a thousand times or more than the original price. In this way, many guilds became wealthy social organizations, and some even built houses on the vacant land they owned and rented them out to others. The rent they received was used to invest in more land, increasing their assets day by day. That depended on the chairman's skillful management.</p>
<p>Originally, the association was part of the guild and was merged together, but later, the population in the concessions increased year by year. In the bustling city center, storing many coffins affected hygiene and was met with disapproval from the urban authorities. Moreover, land prices rose so high that it was a pity to use valuable land for storing coffins. Therefore, the general guilds separately purchased land in Nanshi and Zhabei and built mortuaries, separating the association from the guild, and the houses and land vacated by the original association could be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>From then on, the guild seemed to focus on administration, specializing in providing medical treatment, dispensing medicine, providing relief to fellow townsmen, and establishing schools. When people died, they would first contact the guild, pay the fees according to the regulations, and then carry the coffin to the association for temporary storage. Indeed, for people living in Shanghai, if the coffin could not be sent back to their hometown immediately after death, only the association could solve this problem for you.</p>
<p>After a person died, the coffin was stored in the association. There were three levels of storage places: upper, middle, and lower. A coffin stored in a separate room was called a "large single room" or "small single room." Three to five coffins stored in one room were called a "shared room." Many coffins stored together were called a "common room." The storage fee ranged from four or five yuan to one or two hundred yuan per year. However, fellow townsmen could enjoy a discount of half the fee according to the regulations. If the fee was not paid after one year, they would transport the coffin to the public cemetery in their hometown for burial around Qingming Festival.</p>
<p>Since most of the associations were in Nanshi and Zhabei, and Shanghai had a war, due to the inconvenience of transportation, some guilds were forced to re-allocate part of their houses in the concessions for temporary coffin storage. The storage fee was naturally particularly high, also containing some speculative elements. At the same time, funeral homes, coffin storage places, and the like were constantly discovered and established in western Shanghai due to the association being under blockade, forming an emerging industry specifically for the bereaved families to store coffins.</p>

<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>—Glimpses of the Unfortunate Encounters and Happy Developments of Children—</p>
<p>China Children's Friendship Research Society</p>
<p>The society has only a dozen or so members, but their interest in research is very strong. Their works are often published in various children's newspapers. Now, it has merged with the Children's Friendship Literary Society, and has established general affairs and communication departments to manage the society's affairs, as well as science and literary groups to lead research.</p>
<p>Children's New Reading Club</p>
<p>The club was founded in 1937, originally located in Hongkou. After August 13th, the club's books were all destroyed by artillery fire. Now, they are re-collecting books, with more than 400 children's books available for members to borrow. There are currently seven members, all around the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>(3) Undertakings Regarding Child Education</p>
<p>Wartime Children's Shelter</p>
<p>In the various refugee shelters in Shanghai, refugee children account for a large number. In addition, there is also a wartime children's shelter dedicated to housing refugee children. The shelter is located at the St. John's YMCA Middle School and houses about 650 children, ranging in age from five to thirteen or fourteen. Most of them are orphans rescued from the war zone, and some are sent by residents of nearby slums for foster care. The shelter is established by the Chinese Child Welfare Association.</p>
<p>Street Children's Vocational Training Institute</p>
<p>The institute is located on Xiamen Road and was opened by the Shanghai International Relief Committee in mid-June last year. It currently offers handicrafts such as bamboo work, carpentry, shoemaking, towel making, patching, tailoring, and weaving, and also provides elementary education. Children are divided into two groups: those who study and those who learn skills. One group attends classes and the other group works, alternating in shifts. The current number of residents is 110.</p>
<p>Shanghai Relief Refugee Children's Training Institute</p>
<p>The institute raises refugee children aged four to fourteen, providing them with education. It is currently renting land on Wuding Road and building its own houses, so that it can house as many refugee children as possible to achieve the purpose of universal relief.</p>
<p>Beggar Children's Training Institute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Child Welfare Association is planning to establish a beggar children's training institute to house beggar children, provide them with strict guidance, and teach them appropriate education and life skills, so that they can become self-reliant in society in the future. The institute is currently in preparation and will be established soon.</p>
<p>(4) Emerging Children's Education Undertakings</p>
<p>Refugee Children's Education</p>
<p>The refugee shelters established by various charitable organizations in Shanghai number 221. Initially, each shelter automatically organized children's education classes, but later, the Chinese Red Cross Society invited 19 members to form an education committee to manage refugee children's education. A total of 14,560 children are being educated, with 383 teachers. The curriculum is divided into five subjects: Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, and physical education. Classes are taught for more than two hours a day, and the curriculum is the same as that of ordinary primary schools.</p>
<p>Street Children's Education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Street Children's Education Association is implementing street children's education. In the past year, it has opened 153 street children's education classes, educating 6,248 children. It is now divided into eight districts, with four classes in each district, totaling 32 classes. Each class is taught for two hours a day. There are 1,456 children enrolled and 54 teaching staff. Recently, a mobile library box has been added, which rotates daily to each district to provide general street children with after-school reading.</p>
<p>Newsboy Education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Child Welfare Association has founded 10 newsboy schools, with more than 500 newsboys enrolled. Now, 11 more schools have been added, totaling 21 schools, of which 14 have already opened. The work outline is divided into two categories: teaching and health. The funds were raised by Chen Hecheng, the chairman of the association, for more than 800 yuan, and the Shen Bao newspaper donated 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Compulsory Education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Institute provides relief to out-of-school children, taking responsibility for education expenses and sending them to various primary schools to study. The China Circulation Library founded a free primary school, enrolling poor children, charging no tuition fees, and providing books and stationery. The Hudong Commune runs four free night schools for apprentices, specializing in recruiting apprentices from shops and small factories, providing free education.</p>
<p>Scientific Experiments</p>
<p>In order to promote children's science and impart various manufacturing techniques to children, the Shanghai YMCA has established a children's science laboratory on Sichuan Road, divided into five groups: biology, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and woodworking. Each group conducts experiments for two days a week, three hours each time. Each group lasts for two months, and each person pays three yuan per term, including experiments and lecture notes.

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: The Newlyweds are a Perfect Match, the Yue Silk and Wu Brocade are Woven into Seven Patterns</p>
<p>The telegram from the two Miss He's arrived in Beiping, and within three days, they received a quick letter from Mr. He. The letter said: "I have been in Beiping for several days. The contract for barter trade, using our country's tea to exchange for Soviet oil, has also been signed and published. I think you have seen it in the newspapers. In addition, there are several international trade events that are being negotiated. We also want to imitate the method of barter trade with the Soviet Union for the soybeans of the three northeastern provinces, exchanging them for their machinery and pigments with Germany. Therefore, I must go to the three northeastern provinces." The letter also said: "In the past, you two sisters had the intention of establishing a textile factory in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. We have not discussed it in detail. Now, in Beiping, I met two friends from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and talked to them about it, and they were very happy. They advocate starting a silk weaving factory first, which can do foreign trade business. According to them, Europeans and Americans like Chinese silk products very much. In the past, when European and American giant ships arrived in Shanghai, they would definitely buy a lot of Chinese silk fabrics. They said: Chinese silk products are much better than Japanese ones, and they are willing to buy Chinese goods. Unfortunately, Chinese silk merchants adhere to old methods, do not think about improvements, only sell domestically, and are unwilling to do Western-style business. Now they are very ambitious in this regard, but unfortunately, they lack the textile expertise. I mentioned you two briefly, and they were extremely happy to hear that you studied textiles in the United States. As for capital, they don't worry about it. They said they can raise one million yuan and let me take 20%. This is not a problem, but are you happy to do it? I often hear you say that after returning to China, you must have a career. But the career must be one that you are happy to do and confident in. If what you use is not what you have learned, then it is meaningless. Looking back, our country's raw silk exports have been in a slump. When we were in the United States, we investigated the raw silk they used, and those from Japan accounted for 70%. The remaining 30% was supplied by our country, France, and Italy. It is a pity that our country, which originally ranked first in sales to the United States, has fallen to such a level. Later, Japan specialized in aggression, and people went out to be soldiers, and the number of silkworm farmers gradually decreased. In addition, various countries boycotted Japanese goods and stopped using Japanese raw silk. American female students were even unwilling to wear silk stockings. Japanese raw silk fell drastically year after year. Now, Japanese raw silk accounts for only 25% of the raw silk used in the United States, while raw silk sold to the United States has jumped to 65%. This can be considered the recovery of our raw silk exports, but we must strive not only for raw materials but also for finished products." (79)</p>
