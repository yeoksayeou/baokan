<p>社評</p>
<h3>最近遠東情况剖視</h3>
<p>各國元首閣員，負有實際政治之重任者；，蔚為耳目口舌所寄托者，近日絕不諱飾，局之萬分嚴重；其人其言，例不勝舉，焦點問題，近日有關但澤之各方動態，皆為報章亦無待吾人贅述；其間如德國對於所傳四國會議，共謀折衷辦法之說，痛斥不留餘地，允為憧憬於綏靖政策者之當頭棒喝；顯示本問題業已進展至最後二階段：一日德國志在必得，惟視發動之以何月何日何種方式而已。二日波蘭於德國發動之後，若非拱手讓人，惟有揭開大戰之序幕而已。事在朝暮，禍迫眉睫；固將如何演進，如何趨歸，此實世界當前之大謎也；茲請存而不論，先論歐美人心目中之世界第二問題。</p>
<p>遠東問題乃世界問題中之一部分；舉凡遠東種種消長皆與世界息息相關。他不具論，假定中國不抗戰或抗戰而轉瞬潰敗，則遠東不成為問題；然日本因得控制中國而如虎傅翼，德義尤必結合日本而如虎傅翼，則英法非效法中國而從事抗戰，即步武捷克而遭受宰割；豈復容爭持如當前之所謂但澤問題哉！即此一端可知遠東問題與世界問題之不可分，抑且中國抗戰實為民治國家從容應付世界問題之中流砥柱也。假定遠束凶鋒，共謀遏止於當年發動侵略之始，則遑論國際秩序井然，德義未必遽爾發難，即使野心不戢，然英法得以全力應付歐洲，侵略者豈得跋扈如今日。是亦可知民治國家今日之所以皺眉蹙額者，猶以當年對遠東未能負其應負之責任，及今自食其報耳。祇以歐美人之成見，夙以歐陸為世界之中心；復以為歐戰發動之日，無法置身事外，而於遠束糾紛猶得自遠於漩渦；於是所謂遠東問題者，在彼視為第二問題，實際初不若是也。更以最近情况證之，彼以但澤問題為世界問題當前之中心者，局中之兩方，俱不得不視遠東為收付乘除中之重要關鍵；然則遠東問題豈第二問題哉！</p>
<p>云何近况？（一）英日之東京談判，漸决暴露其先天的矛盾之本相；昨日倫敦電訊，英國政府亦承認前途希望之微薄，僅圖避免談判之突然宣告破裂而已；此在日本方面，既矯揉造作於擒縱之術，而斥英人為二重外交，意謂英人一面與日本虛相委蛇，一面企圖牽引他國，徐待世變云。（二）日軍在華南突襲深圳，深圳者與九龍新界僅一水之隔；自此英日間之相對峙，猶非上海租界與浦束可比，乃類蘇州河南北；橋樑可通，亦類黃浦江畔之外擺渡橋而已；重砲射程，可撩香港，此其意義，謂對束京談判之威脅，亦世界戰爭發生時，日本剷除香港英國海陸空軍根據地之重要佈局也。（三）英法蘇聯三國在莫斯科之參謀會議，有蘇聯方面提出軍備顯及遠東之說；此在三國商討政治協定時，三國俱斥牽涉遠東云云為無稽；今則美人之美聯社，德人之海通社，法人之哈瓦斯社，俱有此訊；三國當局對此雖無正面之表示，然最穩健而模稜，且最欲隔離遠束問題之英國方面，茲已不復岸然不理；據昨日哈瓦斯社電傳「英國負責人士」謂「日本若加入德義軍事盟的，則三國參謀談話之範圍自當擴大而及於遠東」。（四）蘇聯應付一切問題，其精神與態度輒介於「錙銖必較」與「絲毫不苟」之間，總之，不虛誇，不過亦無不及；茲傳彼所建議於三國參謀會議者如彼，而其實際行動則有空軍焉，實際演習於海參崴外之日本海上，有陸軍焉，源源輸送至遠東。（五）據某方消息，德義兩國報社派駐天津之記者，茲已奉命離津而赴山海關外；新聞記者固先於國族運動視聽之觸鬚也。</p>
<p>凡此種種近况，乃世界大局萬分嚴重之中，所見之於遠東者。夫自但澤乃至於深圳，自英倫負責人士乃至於德義駐津記者，其間縱橫錯雜，儀態萬千，為因為果，為是為非，或虛或實，或信或疑，吾人誠難歸納各國之意識行動，追求其貫串之綫索，論斷其必然之趨歸；即使退一步而剖析凡百近况，確定其間孰者主，孰者賓，權衡其間如何重輕緩急，亦復有所難能。姑為抉擇其間之一端而推演之：則遠東問題雖以中日戰爭為主題，然與有密切之利害痛癢關係，若接若離，忽勇忽怯，既不敢進，復不甘退，既似同情中國以抗日本，復似諂媚日本以縊中國者，有一英國；中國臺志抗戰，日本岐途當前，故中英間親讐之道極簡明，而英日間則爾詐我虞，鈎心鬥角；彼東京談判雖為兩國周旋之主題，然彼此盤旋，極微妙之致者，則為日本是吾加入德義軍事盟的問題。就本問題而推演之：惟恐侵略集團團結之加強，德義氣燄之昂進，於世界未戰則增進戰爭之危機，於大戰既作則擴大戰爭之範圍，而香港越南新加坡乃至於印度與蘇彝士運河備受威脅；緣是而不願日本加入德義軍事盟的，此為英國絕對之觀感，其一也。於外交上則縱橫捭闔，虛張聲勢；於戰時則與國多多益善，况其海軍力量乃居舉世二三之間，此其價値，甯待言宣；緣是而歡迎日本加入軍事盟的，此為德義兩國所滿望者，其二也。德義願望雖奢，允願不戰而定，况無制勝把握，詎有開戰決心，乃以與日締盟，日本希圖自拔於絕境而冒險引起世界戰爭，使德義不得不因日本而助日作戰，此違反素願者也；戰則凶多吉少，即使勝，本身之瘡痍難復，亦惟有坐視日本獨享遠束，夫與中國何仇，乃坐失中國市塲，此得不償失者也；即使不因此而戰，亦使德義因日本而對蘇聯對美國隔閡愈深，此負虛名而蒙實害者也；緣是而對於日本方面所宣傳之加盟問題，及近頃愈表示其淡漠，此為德義所苦悶者，其三也。因加盟於德義軍的而與民治國隔閡愈深，因軍的而深入歐局漩渦，甚至因歐局而以海軍為孤注，此於對華作戰非特無益，抑且樹敵愈衆，而使英國苟且妥協之希望愈微；此日本溫和派望軍的而却步者，其四也。加盟軍的，對國內則齊一意志，强化政權；對英國則示以强毅，使英國屈膝；甚至以軍的而開展為世界大戰之局，俾得自對華軍事之絕境，獲致萬一之生路；此日本少壯者硬幹之精神，視加盟為別有洞天者，其五也。抑此猶正常之演進也，往年歐洲大戰，義大利非背棄德奧而有得於英法者乎？國際本無道義，况有先咧；則安得以今日之加盟德義軍約，推動德義至於火山之巓，鼓噪世界入於喋血之境，顧乃及時而挾德義以論價於英法，是不但陷中國於孤立，亦無求不得於英法；德義墜深淵，日本為天驕子矣；循彼先例，歷史因有如此循環複演之能者也；此又非彼主張加盟者之一念歟，此其六也。</p>
<p>由上述之析論，知前途之紛歧；而英國在瞻顧徬徨，一籌莫展者，非稍遠之將來，利害猶有此較之餘地，僅為應付目前，有其忠得忠失之一念為之祟耳。</p>
<h3>美政府反對修正滬租界地位　副國務卿重申美國態度　津美婦被辱案正交涉中　日購飛機合同簽訂甚早</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國副國務卿韋爾斯、昨日向新聞記者聲稱、美國對日本提議修正上海公共租界地位之態度、仍未改變、五月十七日、美國會以備忘錄致送日方、文內美國主張目前中國情勢、不適宜考慮日方建議、美國對該問題態度、始終一貫、韋爾斯對於遠東各問題、詳加評論、渠稱、國務院對於天津李却特夫人被辱案熟加考慮、國務院已接得關於李却特夫人、被天津日本哨兵一人批頰之詳細報告、在未接獲天津日本當局答覆美方抗議之前、渠不能正式評論該案、但渠可向新聞記者保證美國政府對該案已「詳加考慮」、關於國務院批准道格拉斯飛機廠、與日本航空公司簽訂美金一百萬元新合同事、韋爾斯鄭重聲明、美國政府反對出售飛機與轟炸平民國家之政策、並未改變、本合同則於美國國務院發表政策之前簽訂云（十七日美聯社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美國道格拉期飛機廠、曾以軍用飛機售予日本、業於上月間運往該國、美國各報評論此事、對於政府有不滿之意、副國務卿滅爾斯、頃發表談話、加以答覆、略謂赫爾國務卿、去年勸告各飛機廠、對於轟炸平民各國、母以飛機售予之、此項政策迄未變史、道格拉斯廠與日本所訂合同、乃在赫爾國務卿發出勸告之前云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>香港已形成武裝化</h3>
<p>興建防空總部　全島防禦嚴密</p>
<p>香港通訊、邇來遠東情勢、日趨嚴重、英國軍政當局、特積極增强香港及新加坡防禦力量、尤其對於空軍、特別重視、如飛機隊之增添、飛機塲之開闢、均其犖犖大者、頃悉目下英國鑒於情勢之急迫、已調大隊空軍、如轟炸機·驅逐機·偵察機·飛船等、到遠東增防、井已有大部空軍、集中星洲、本港方面、亦有相當機隊　來、而在星洲飛船及機隊、多數能作長途飛行、如有戰事發生、可隨時直飛來港、協助偵察及作戰、以今日港星軍力之强、實足以抵禦任何襲擊也、</p>
<p>空軍建設</p>
<p>香港當局對於空軍建設、亦秉承英政府意旨、努力進行、本港防空設備處、鑒於現在防空總部部地方不敷應用、工作未能充分發展、乃呈請港政府批准撥出巨款興建一所偉大之防空總部、經詳細之考慮後、乃決定各項計劃、於本月七日開始建築、其建築地點、在跑馬地喼道與摩和遜山道轉角處一小山對下之　地、現首先進行打椿工程、據防空專員施柏堅談話云、總部建築工程費約十萬　、刻下工程已趕緊進行、可　於本年十一月一日建成、將來總部內建築一防空壕、內可容一百人、以備於本港遭遇空襲時、作為防空工作人員避彈地方、總部內並分設各部工作人員實習室、裝置各種電機電話、以便各通訊員實習通訊工作、俾於戰時得應付裕如、</p>

<p>軍事設備</p>
<p>倫敦索描日報記者鄧勤麥意治侖、日前過港考察本港情狀後、即發電報告索描日報、內容大意稱、駐港英人雖少、但萬一戰事發生、則因平時已有準備、定能從容應付香港距離歐洲約九千里、歐洲一聲槍響、遠東帝國屬土、立即亦被牽動、鄧氏并稱本人曾以一日之時間、踏遍全港各處、結論認定香港不啻直布羅陀第二、彼親見全島佈滿機關槍位、密如蜂巢、鐵綱重重、勢若天塹、今年佈置防禦工事經費、現已逹五十萬金鎊、幾佔全部稅收百份之二十、中國沿海各地、今大部雖已淪陷、但日軍倘速戰速決策略不能成功、則經濟枯竭、已足為其致命傷、近又變本加厲、發動反英運動、廣東日軍迫近香港不過五十里、星洲則遠在一千五百里以外、故一般意見、皆以日軍遲早侵港、英人必難久守為可憂慮、但據鄧勤調查所得、駐港英人除婦孺須疏散外、一致表示誓死不退、決盡國民守土天職、彼本人亦認為任何强國、欲攻擊香港而佔領之、或用封鎖政策而屈服之、結果必歸失敗、蓋香港本身足以長期堅守、是即香港之軍事價値也、若單用封鎖、共作用上只可警告英帝國、對於軍事上實無多大效能云云、</p>

<h3>日方發言人聲明　不致封鎖滬租界　滬津局勢不同順加考慮　日報發表主張跡近挑撥</h3>
<p>字林報云、日方發言人昨日（十六日）在招待新聞記者席上聲和、上海公共租界與法租界並無今日或明日即遭日陸軍封鎖之危險、因此種手段、全視將來事件而定也、就目下事態斷之、將來不致有使封鎖此間外國管理區域、成為勢所必行之事件、或詢歐洲發展對此間日方可能的行動、是吾有何影響、發言人稱、亞洲事件與歐局無關、嗣經各記者紛提許多問題、發言人乃發表言論如次、</p>
<p>有無舉動須視輕視</p>
<p>日軍佔據上海區、幾已兩載、有田克萊琪方案中、英國承認日軍為保護自已起見、不得不取某辦法、然上海現况、有種對事實之承認、若有害怕軍福利之援蔣活動、繼續不輟、日軍將不得不取新立場、慛何者將促起此種新立場、乃活動的程度之問題、</p>
<p>封鎖之說認為謠諑</p>
<p>某記者詢、任何東京妥洽、對於上海局勢、能有何種關係、據答、此間局勢、與天津現局不同、而須加以考慮、封鎖英租界與法租界問題、已引甚大不安、而使外界紛傳可能的封鎖之消息、此種消息、必須認之為謠諑、發言人切實聲明封鎖為可能的、但未必有此事云、</p>
<p>香港行動杜絕軍火</p>
<p>關於所傳公共租界與法租界刻作凖備以應付可能的日方封鎖本市之說、叩諸兩租界行政機關高級人員、彼等咸矢口吾認、並稱、此說「太屬可哂、不値一評」、或詢華南發來香港或亦遭封鎖之說確吾、日方發言人答稱、目前日軍在香港近郊之行動、實係封鎖海岸之一部份、以防軍器軍火得達中國內地、</p>
<p>法院牒文未允發表</p>
<p>某記者請發表日方致法租界公重局關於法院之牒文詳則、發言人稱、該牒文僅係法方對此事提建議之答覆、日方已發覺對該項建議不能滿意、牒文詳細內容、不能發表、或問、謠傳法當局建議設立混合法院之說確吾、據答「若吾人以然或吾答覆此問、則將洩露一切詳情」、</p>
<p>武力解決當無其事</p>
<p>或詢若談判未得移交法院之結果、日方將吾訴諸武力、發言人稱、渠不能答覆、某記者續稱、然今日（十六日）日人「上海每日新聞」稱只此兩途、據答、此或屬該報之意見、某記者曰、然「上海每日新開」與日方官塲有密切關切、發言人乃微笑叩不發一辭、</p>
<p>日報主張類似鼓動</p>
<p>字林報云、較溫和之本埠日文「上海每日新聞一咋日（十六日）社評稱、日當局應立即控制上海公共租界與法租界中之華方法院、並使與重慶政府連聯之銀行停閉、日本若果不取此等步驟、則上海外國管理區中之敵性如加强、乃屬咎由自取、日當局對外交談判竟告失敗時、即用武力接收法租界中法院具有「堅定之决心」、若非法當局承認上海新局勢、而懷善意行事、或將發生</p>
<p>許多糾紛</p>
<p>特區法院與華方大銀行、乃重慶政府之機關、在兩租界中公開經營、法院人員、係重慶委任、應用蔣政權之法律、已成外國管理區中「敵性」之證據、法院須歸日方或「維新政府」當局管理、否則希望在外國管理區中樹立和平、不啻緣木求魚、華方銀行在匕海外國管理區域中獲得款項、資助中國、</p>
<p>對日抗戰</p>
<p>並談判購買軍需、接濟蔣將軍、重慶政府之其他許多機關、得兩兩租界當局之保護、擬擾亂日軍陣錢之後方、利用此等區域、作為對日敵對行動之根據地、日政府「不能容忍」法院與中中交農四行之公然存在、日當局對退入租界之三至八千華兵及彼等之槍械如何處置一節、亦將即刻質問兩租界當局、聞大批</p>
<p>扣留華兵</p>
<p>已予釋出、彼等之槍械巳交讓、一九三七年工海失陷時、日方未接收中政府之一切機關、巳鑄「錯誤」、今已達應立即取此行動之階段矣、日政府於去年一月十六日已確定對國民政府之政策、新政權已獲得力量接收中政府在上海之機關而不復妨碍第三國權益之階段、巳到達矣、</p>
<h3>公共汽車　將加票價　已向工部局申請　電車有再加價說</h3>
<p>大陸報云昨（十六日）悉英商中國公共汽車公司為增加其行駛公共租界之公共汽車票價起見、頃巳申請工部局准許調整票價、因工部局前已核准電車公司加價、故衆信局方殆必准公共汽車公司之申請、查公共租界電車係六月　九日加價者、至於公共汽車票價將漲至</p>
<p>何種程度，以及若經核准何日實行新價兩節、昨日均無徵象可得、惟據一般人指稱、觀於汽油與煤油大漲、公共汽車公司之申請、似極正常、按滬戰爆發後、中國公共汽車公司因蘇州河南岸人口增多、</p>
<p>營業益盛、且能補償蘇州河北岸之損失而有餘、故未增價、同時衆信上海電車公司、將申請復增票便、電車公司某代表答覆詢問、吾認刻在考慮此舉、惟稱「此舉有充分理由」、</p>

<p>（一）叫行倉庫密邇租界、彈丸橫飛、租界人士、生命財產實屬可慮、余等承領事團決議、授意英美海陸軍司令、要求我最高當局下令撤退、自民國二十六年十月三十一日起、至去年十一月止、余等給養、山地方慈善機關供給、從去年十二月起至本年八月份止、共九個月、余按月向工部局借墊四千五百元、計共叫萬零五百元、均經余出具正式收條、而工部局業經要求中國政府歸還墊款、四月間該局巳經收到叫萬三千六百兀、所謂「並未支付分文經費」者、不知中國　府此時尙存三千一百元於工部局也、（詳細情形將來余擬另為文公諸世人）、</p>
<p>公法歷史均有前例</p>
<p>茲余略舉國際法及歷史前例一二，國　法一九〇七年海牙公約第五編、關於中立國收容交戰國軍隊之規定、其第十一條、若共官佐可吾令其宣誓、不私自出境而聽其自由之處、由中立國政府確定之、第十二條、除經專的規定外、中立國應供給在扣兵士衣服食物、及人道上所應給之救濟、一切費用、應於和議定後償還、說到歷史最顯著之例如一八七一年普法之戰、瑞士國收容法軍八萬餘、戰馬一萬匹、及戰後法國應償還瑞士維待費計一千一百萬法郎之多、而世界大戰時瑞士國收容協商同盟兩方軍隊、瑞士對於供給維持費、有窮於應付之感、人數之多、無法統計、</p>
<p>謝氏聲明　撤退原因</p>
<p>（二）但余應先聲明、余等由第三者要求而撤退、不能與逃卒相提並論、（三）將來價還可能不可能問題、非余今日所能言、唯或人鑒於工部局財源、正在困難之際、而作杞人之憂、言不隱衷、余以為其欲言不曾者、必為公共租界虹口區應趕快交還工部局、租界四週之種種限制、應從速取消、俾工部局告渴之財源、稍舒積困也、</p>

<h3>來滬途中之猶太難民　命運仍未決定　工部局與日領商談無結果　倘日方不收容將拒絕登岸</h3>
<p>字林報云、現在來滬途中之五百猶太難民、其命運仍未可决、因駐滬日總領事三浦與工部局總裁費利浦星期二日會談、討論此輩來滬難民在虹口樓身之可能事、雙方尙未商妥也、此事刻在</p>
<p>雙方考慮</p>
<p>中、昨日（十六日）並未續行會談、咋日（十六日）為在滬猶太難民向日方登記、俾得在虹口居住經商之截止期、若日方嚴格實行其七月十日之備忘錄、則行將抵滬者、不准留居蘇州河北岸矣、聞諸可靠非官塲方面、費利浦與三浦晤談時、指出蘇州河南岸之屋宇短缺、並表示希望日當局</p>
<p>例外准許</p>
<p>此後數星期內抵滬之五百人，留居蘇州河北岸「但若日當局對行將抵滬者、留居蘇州河北岸事、不予同意、則彼等顯有不准登岸之可能、因預料工部局不准若輩棲身蘇州河南岸也、記者昨日叩詢此間照料難民之委員會委員、彼等均不願發言、惟希望對此輩難民苦境極表同情之工部局與日當局、使現在</p>
<p>來滬途中</p>
<p>者、均能在此登岸、據昨晚日方消息、某日輪自歐返日、昨晨抵滬、載來猶太移民六十四人登岸、其後即不復准許移民入虹口矣、自去年九月二十三日第一批猶太難民二百二十三人乘意郵輪抵此以還、上海猶太人、現已增至、萬五千人左右云、</p>
<h3>北江西路封鎖綫　加添工事　祇海寗路可通行　一部份商店停業</h3>
<p>公共租界北區與虹口交界處之北江西路、自上月二十九日經日方將該路從目來水橋朝北至靶子路一段東邊馬路、用有刺鉛絲木架攔阻後、開放崇明路·文監師路·海寗路·三處缺口、自經滬戰兩週紀念特別戒備後、現祗有崇明路·海寗路·兩處可通、且崇明路江西路口出人、必須有通行許可證以及防疫針證、方可通行、如僅有通行許可證、則仍不可行、故實際上祗海寗路一處可通、咋見崇明路西口緣無防疫針證而被扣留在鐵絲網中之男女、有二三十人、其餘皆不准出入而退還、沿東邊馬路封鎖綫內之商店號買、昨見均在鐵絲網內互相授受、頗感不便、所以有一部份商店、竟停止營業、又因該處所攔鉛絲木架、緣鐵絲甚為單薄、以故咋見該日兵等復在靶子路朝南至天潼路一帶加釘木椿、添置鐵網等防禦工事、</p>
<h3>康斯坦鐵諾夫代理　蘇聯總領　西邁期蓋總領請假　署務暫由康民權署</h3>

<h3>寄往外國郵件　將加收滙兌附加稅　定爲百分之百下月實行　係暫時性質將來可取消</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海甫接電報消息、寄往各外國之郵件郵資、不久將倍於目前、國內郵費將無更變、聞自九月一日起、國外郵費將收百分之百之「臨時匯兌附加稅」、而郵局並不增加一倍郵費、蓋徵收附加稅、於郵費能復常態時、辦理復原事宜、較為簡單也、此舉聞之似屬分析過細、然其功效實同、而收附加稅之原因、在於郵費乃以各國貨幣折合同價計算、查郵費乃根據金法郎為標準、此前法幣與一金法郎價値相等、目前之金法郎値法幣二元五角以上、當局徵收附加稅、未使法幣與金法郎完全同價、而適將目前郵費增加一倍、以便計算、自九月一日起實行、至今為止、僅接得電報通知、二三日內、上海可望接得完全之書面命令、屆時將在報紙公布正式通告、此訊係今日自郵政當局聞悉者、</p>
<h3>國內匯兌管理後　已收顯著成效　內地滙款十餘萬減至二三萬　滙額嚴格限制滙費特予提高</h3>
<p>國內滙兌自財政部實施管理後、巳有極顯著之成效、蓋內地逃避至淪陷區域之資金、大為减少也、茲錄於左、</p>
<p>管理國內滙兌效果</p>
<p>擄大通社記者向上海儲滙局探悉、東川·西川（即叫川）·廣西·貴州·雲南·湖南等各地、在國內滙兌未施管理前、每日滙上海之款項、總數在十萬元以上、惟自實施管理以後、巳减至二三萬元、豈非管理已收良好之成效乎、</p>
<p>滙額減少滙費增加</p>
<p>查以前內地滙上海每日可滙一千元、繼减至五百元、嗣又减至二百元、自實施管理以後、則祇能匯五十元、內地匯上海滙款之補水費、亦由每元收五分至十餘分者、增為自十五分至四十六分、即浙江匯滬匯款補水費、亦增至十一分、</p>

<h3>航商在鎭海　設輸渡局</h3>
<p>寗波防守司令特准滬甬復航後、因鎭海封銷綫缺口已堵塞、行駛滬甬之德平思德謀福哈納頴州等輪、均改泊鎭海口外之七里嶼、貨物旅客均用駁船駁送、關於駁送之安全問題、各輪船公司及寗波當局頗為重視、聞已由航商組織鎭海輪渡局、業已於本月十四起開航、茲錄通告如下本局為謀赴滬旅客安全迅捷起見、特放專輪、定本月十四日起、於每日下午五時由江北岸棠賽碼頭搭載赴滬旅客、直駛鎭海口外、惟旅客須先到本局辦事處購票上船、其持有各輪船公司過駁證者、得照價抵除、又每日下午六時後、專在鎭海渡送口外旅客、特此通告、</p>
<h3>棉紗暗市開幕後　國紗交易活躍　求過於供昨均漲價　日取引所無人顧問</h3>
<p>棉紗暗市交易、經前日通告限以三大原則愼重買賣、乃即密囑市場監視人昌嚴厲執行、其決定禁條、凡有少數欠穩客戶、概予淘汰之處分、因此激發市塲人心、一致專向國紗方面、彼此需胃甚殷、所惜現貨有限、終造成求過於供之局面、國紗價格亦因之高昂、各廠各種紗品、昨日均漲價不等、至於市塲內一般交易、澈底係國紗現貨冒賣、</p>
<p>外紗交易</p>
<p>間有少數成交咸屬暗中私相授受、但均為在市塲以外或茶會中密洽、非暗市當局能力所及、該暗市會員更換新證辦法、純為某種必要之措置、嗣後雖或有投機者鑽入、其不良技倆、決難施展、因巳訂定交易新法、可</p>
<p>隨時揭發</p>
<p>其錯誤、繼據大光社記者向關係方面探悉、日方近今積極籌備組織之棉紗取引所、原擬引吸正當商人人彼彀中、但以各廠商深明大義、概予</p>
<p>拒絕合作</p>
<p>所傳若干華人加入該所為經紀人、全屬子虛、所址雖已決定在九江路前金業交易所內、迄今仍為空中樓閣、據一般觀察、該所決難期實現、其主要原因、（一）日本本國內各地紗廠、因對華作戰影響、工人被徵服</p>
<p>兵役過多</p>
<p>生產力已减少十分之六七、（二）滬地日本紗廠出品、為統制淪陷區銷路、已由各日廠直接運往各地、本埠銷路大减、（三）日紗戰後在華銷路、因各地華人早下對日經濟絕交之決心、絕無採用日紗者、上海方面、前决雖有小布廠採用、但自國紗暢銷後、日紗亦受影響、</p>
<h3>新北京輪興泉貨運　原船裝回</h3>
<p>英商太古公司新北京輪、於上月一日、自滬載貨赴聞省之興化·泉州·秀嶼·等處、惟興泉早為日軍禁航、故抵與泉後、遭日攔阻、未能進口、經交涉數旬、仍</p>

<p>是否行駛、須俟貨物卸淸後再决定、該公司頴州輪、昨由鎭海口返滬、定二十日續航鎭海、中意公司德平輪、前定今日回滬、咋據公司接該輪電告、須二十日晨始可返滬、</p>
<p>本定明晨</p>
<p>駛甬、現亦須延至下星期二（二十二日）晨四時開甬、遠東公司哈納輪、已於前日下午二時許返滬、定明日（十九日）上午四時續航鎭海、乘客今晚均須登輪、</p>

<h3>前晚兆豐花園兇毆案　內幕情形複雜　事主東家失竊手槍子彈　兇犯兩名實有重大嫌疑</h3>
<p>前晚九時三十分左右、愚園路底兆豐花園動物院旁、突有四男子將另一男子名秦厚興者、園住兇毆、同時並以繩索圍繞秦之頸部、擬予勒斃、幸秦大聲乎救、致駐防兆豐花園旁之英囡駐軍多名、聞警立即越竹笆而至、</p>

<p>與秦姘識</p>
<p>但不知因何兩人竟因此事而發生糾紛、演成頃間之一幕云云、昨晨捕房將周張兩人解送特一法院刑八庭、工部局律師錢恂九依刑法二百七十七條傷害罪起訴、並稱被告等雖稱起因由於女子金寳、但事實殊難足信、今晨捕房接得秦厚興東家之報告、謂其所有之</p>
<p>手槍三支</p>
<p>子彈一百粒、突於十六日被竊、而是日在逃之陳國元張小二、曾至該西人家留時甚久、故本件之原因、決無如此簡單、捕房尙須嚴密偵查、故請將本案予以延期審理云云、經孟庭柯推事向秦厚興及兩被告質訊之下、乃諭令兩被告還押、改期一星期再訊、</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均回縮二五、紐約銀價突回小半分、倫敦生金未更、匯兌英對美·對法·對滬均平、美對英仍平、對滬降二角、對法跌一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士半、美匯六元八一二五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後首由某美行吐予同行現貨英金三便士半、繼而大通賣予有利現貨美滙六元七五、為狀略軟、迨滙豐掛牌曉、俱無上落、及白銀平衡稅曉依然免徵、此後市勢尙平、迨至十一時光景、因有利續代某方扒結、兼沙遜與洋行界亦紛來稍扒、雖其時港電曾來拋塞、但外行賣意淡薄、致市勢續趨軟化、計有利與洋行及沙遜等吸進港電某美行現貨英金三便女四三七五、並現貨美匯六元六八七五、繼而沙遜又扒進外行本月份英金三便士三七五、後匯豐結進同行現貨英金三便士三七五、時某美行亦忽吸進華商現貨美匯六元六二五、此後英金最軟、喊過三便士三四三七五、美匯最緊呌過六元半、將近午刻、雖港電止塞轉扒、但外行尙肯塞出、致局勢漸平、計港電結進外行現貨英余三便士三七五、及現貨美匯六元五六二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三便士三七五、美匯六元五六二五、</p>
<p>沙遜午後回出</p>
<p>後市情况頗平、交易呆滯、惟西商沙遜則稍來拋塞、故為狀遂略回硬、計沙遜塞予外行現貨英金三便士四〇六二五、並現貨美匯六元六二五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三便士四〇六二五、美匯六元六二五、本月份英金三便士三四三七五、美匯六元半、九月份英金二便士九六八七五、美匯五元七五、結果比上日午收、現期英均緊〇九三七五、美俱軟一八七五、</p>

<h3>歐局暗礁仍多　現金漲風稍挫　照外匯核算做撳六七百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、稍形平庸、惟趨勢仍飄忽不定、大致先跌繼漲、而後回挫、均視外匯走勢為目標、初承上日傍晚之疲風、且外滙其時殊平、致晨開遂退達四千四百八十元低盤、嗣後外滙報緊、引起買風、某金號代投機商暨某銀號代外行相繼猛進、無如散戶多頭出籠者頗不乏人、兼銀樓帮與現金號等均有套賣、故價雖飛漲至四千六百四十元高峯、奈中途頗多曲折、入後因外滙稍見回硬、進者漸缺、直瀉至四千五百六十五元、收盤結果比上日祇漲十五元、是以照外滙核算金價愈形拔開、（英金為五千二百零四元七角、美滙為五千二百八十五元三角）、竟猛撳六百四十元至七百二十元、據詢原因有三、（一）關於歐洲局勢暗礁仍多、（二）滙劃貼現依然高昂、（三）且近日來滙市利率竟達月息一角、但此項套利危險性殊少、故本市富商捨此趨彼者、大有人在、致金價漲風遂被阻撓、全天交易的千兩光景、銀樓飾金結果無榮辱、海關金與中英純金等均無變化、</p>
<p>烚赤漲十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外滙尙平、人心仍帶虛疲、致開市與上日晚收後相仿、較前收正式價做小七十元、銀樓帮塞予錢兌業二十兩、價四千四百八十元、開後因聞外滙略軟、致買者較殷、市勢亦頓轉堅昂、盤旋於四千五百允關邊、九時五十分許因錢兌業買意陡濃、情勢更堅、上升六十元、證券帮塞予錢兌業三十兩、價叫千五百六十元時某金號與銀樓帮競相吐售、價遂復趨下疲、不久即撳小四十五元、錢兌業賣予某銀縷五十兩、價四千五百十五元、十時牛後聞外滙扒風頗盛、為狀步軟、致金市買戶亦紛至沓來、售者不前、飛躍直上、未幾即猛漲八十五元、銀樓帮互做三十兩、價四千六百元、時一度又撳低至四千五百八十五元、十時五十分聞外滙央行滙豐亦有吃胃、故黑市滙價更緊、證券帮等買意又濃、再飛升二十五元、錢兌業互做二十兩、價四千六百十元、將近午刻因外滙轉平、人心稍挫、買者觀望、立回入四千六百元關內、錢兌業賣予某金號十兩、為四千五百八十元作午收價、午後初時趨勢更堅、開市即做高十元、某掮客進錢兌業二十兩、價四千五百九十元、後外行復來委託某銀號猛進百餘兩、致價又飛漲五十元、某銀號進金號二十兩、價四千六百叫十元為當日高峯、入後因外滙略硬、錢兌業與銀樓帮等均趁高吐塞、價竟傾瀉七十五元、錢兌業售予金號十兩、四千五百六十五元、昨晚收價、結果較上日又漲十五元、查已運漲四天、共升二百叫十五元、聞收後復抬高至叫千五百八十五元、全天一百六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金結果軋平</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百六十元、迨至九時四十分掛小五元、逾十分許回高五元、十一時十分掛高五元、下午三時四十分又回小五元、此後無變化、結果未有上落、大同行仍懸原價四百六十元、新同行為四百五十八元、收進的减小二十元、又紋銀每兩兌出價大同行突掛高三角、計改懸三元五角、</p>
<p>純金昨無變更</p>
<p>十六日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍屬七鎊八先令七辦士、致中央銀行之各行市價均與上日無異、</p>
<h3>貼現又昂　開二百元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、高昂突銳、每千元上午即逐步昂至午刻高達一百九十元、下午需求現鈔票仍衆、竟再步升十元、最後達二百元關口、比前日再高廿元、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均開一角八分云、</p>
<h3>英美金票　需要奇殷</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、因烚赤變動甚劇、結果較前收相彷彿、是以英美金鎊先堅後回、結果穩定未史、英美金票則以外匯微軟、目需要奇殷、上升較鉅、香港法郎安南等票、因工商界赴西南需要、市間供給不爽、市况堅俏、新加坡票因旅行需耍、微呈昂貴、日金票需要甚盛、上升頗多、晚市為一元一角八分、朝鮮票供給稀少、上升亦銳、晚市為九角九分、其他各幣、供求未盛、市况穩定、公會交易甚稀、僅森泰出祥康進香港票三百元、咋日市價、英金票升一元五角、美金票升三角、香港票升八分、法郎票升一分、新加坡票升一角五分、安南票升二角五分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>美銀突然回小　英印亦反動下降</h3>
<p>十六日倫敦電、銀市印度賣出、投機家時進時出、市面平疲、收盤後、照掛牌價稍有成交、大條銀近遠期均回縮二五、紐的銀電、美現貨突回小半分、又孟買銀電、印銀市况轉疲、現貨與八月均回跌十一安那、九月竟回降十八安那、成交單祇五十張云、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價猛抬三元許　用存底淺薄作宣傳　搖動虛慌中之人心</h3>
<p>最聰明不過的米商、仍在利用新聞政策、又將存底七萬餘包竟為之作宣傳、搖惑人心、其實此項米業自行調查之存數、是吾可作為上海存底看待、盡人皆知其不然、本報屢經揭發、斥其欺人、即如米商調查為確實、若僅此七萬餘包之米、只敷五百萬人口三日之糧、（據稱此項存底、至八月十四日止）有是事實乎、故昨日各晚報一致抨擊、惟上海米價、竟為米業利用之新聞、喪心病在、一漲三元左右、頓使一般民食加重一層負担、正時下所稱為「毒素新聞、」怪不得米業中人口口道好也、</p>
<p>上海存米竟有幾何、此一問題、最好由工部局出而澈查、此時不僅限價一層、應加注意、更應就整個米市作一番檢討、做一種有系統整理、無使米商竊笑「莫予毒也已」、方是全市民食之幸、</p>
<p>客秈運滬、醞釀已久、由雜糧業某主待、復有某銀行素主經濟合作、為之合夥公司、故此决米價之漲、囤戶固應負其責、金融界亦間接直接有以促成之、米業中人、嘗恨囤積太少、發財太少、貪心不足、眞可浩嘆、但小米店確屬困難、大廠大號、固無不大發其財也、</p>
<p>昨日米市暗盤情形、據聞猖獗更甚、在抬硬漲、地方治安、民食艱難、置諸腦後、竟有說高錫粳三十二元、市三十一元、中三十元、蘇同崑粳三十一元至三十元、常州鮮粳三十二元、河下早晚稻二十八元至二十九元、浦東新粳三十担、二十九元，高蕪尖二十七元、决至二十六元、砶尖二十三元半至二十四元、變元三十元、統計成交數不下一萬三千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈咋市買氣極濃、業內外囤商與行販隨趁機高抬、京蕪秈一路猛漲、售價均見衝出廿八元、比之前市較漲三元不等、市面紊亂實為少見、惟來源方面雖未正式放行、然日華商販均在努力搬運、除車運少數外、聞有日船築後丸等裝到六七千包、卸棧於虹口棧房云、</p>
<p>洋米新西貢咋晨開三十三元半、故又抬起二元為三十五元半、惟傳某方擬定一萬噸運滬平售一節、咋已確定成議、並在日內趕裝一萬七千包、期在本月內到埠先行平價出售云、據本報查得、最近有船直放西貢裝米、但係運往印度駁卸云、</p>
<h3>麵粉街銷激增　小麥來源不絕</h3>
<p>麵粉仍站六元原盤、蓋自米價昂騰、市民改食麵粉以來、街銷激增不少、各廠鑒於目下客路交易旣靜、亦注意本街門市、而對客帮需要反予拒絕、故客方在市續收回籠貸廠粉與洋粉、聞回籠貨售價仍為六元一角、十八日運天津麵粉四千六百叫十包、</p>
<p>小麥　來源不絕、人心已不若前兩日熱烈、囤戶與廠胃、雖稱聯蟬而吃盤則已重視、惟米價暴漲、香港局勢轉緊、糧食前途、終占優勢、故執貨者復在扳持、結果續見上升、統市由福新阜豐兩廠合辦京鎭蘇常等麥共十六七車、囤戶拉進二十車、最高價九元一角、較前又漲角許、</p>
<h3>油餅　囤戶作崇　油價漲無止境</h3>
<p>油市繼續向上、漲勢似無止境、一般金融界及殷富者一致加碼、花生油昨市再漲二元半、豆油提升八角至一元、成交靑島桶生油三十桶、價為六十八元五角、神戶桶生油五十桶、價為六十七元、膠州豆油一百件、價為三十九元六角、烟歧豆油三百五十件、價為四十元五角、靑歧豆油一百件、價為四十元、天津聽裝豆油一千聽、價為五十一元五角及二角、大連豆油一百四十桶、價為五十四元八角至五十四元、叉神戶來連油二百五十桶、價為五十五元八角至五十五元五角、叉昨由北沙來豆子八百六十包、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白　見新高價</h3>
<p>咋糖市據倫敦電上落無幾、近期小二五、遠期升二五至七五、公會劃盤、則以外匯關係、續漲甚勁、現貨二四粗白、本棧初為三十九元半、後達四十元、外棧由三十九元升至四十元、轉口貨三十一元至三十二元、太古車白前後共計升二元許、西棧B嘜初為四十三元八角、東棧六角後升至四十四元四角、更有呌四十五元者、餘照退、本綿白隨升二元　振記一號為四十元、本一號冰亦升二元為四十四元、晶明冰四十六元、國糖堅緊依然、潮帮正式黃崗靑開至三十三元三角、成交百餘包、</p>
<h3>紗花　深圳登陸　紗銷突遭打擊　行情漲後又回</h3>
<p>紗市始昆繼弛、趨勢漸呈徘徜之象、實則現銷缺乏、華南一帶日軍突犯深圳、港粵邊境空氣緊張、因之紗銷又遭打擊、本日香港帮採辦僅一百十包、其他帮口亦無舉動、市情殊為和平、升降範圍較狹隘、惟有一部份看漲心思仍不放棄、議論謂原料高昂、廠方成本提高之故也、不過價格入高境耳、前途難免變遷多端、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣緊張、且買者仍擁、開價均漲五六元、少頃聞匯票改縮、黃金又漲、買風尤熾、市盤再升幾元、二十支雙馬外棧貨高價巳達七百六十元、旋以廣帮辦意怠懈、形勢轉疲、又復回挫七八元之譜、二十支雙馬現貨價為七百五十一元、廠單價由六百九十三元跌至六百八十七元、收盤平平、查半日各方成交統計六百三十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨價漲二元、牧羊亦漲二元、廠方未有動靜、今日有棉紗二十二件運烟台、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3>紗銷實况</h3>
<p>近兩日來二十支雙馬·特金城兩牌棉紗銷路、何以獨健、曁售價獨昂、揆其原因、簡述如下、</p>
<p>（一）香港帮盡量採買此紗、因港幣匯滬升水奇昂、將貨販買運達南洋一帶、尙能盈利、該紗發展之由來也、</p>
<p>（二）申新同一紗廠出品之紗、九廠之雙馬紗價値旣高、且不敷應求、二廠之天女紗價値又低、而無去路、查該紗專銷閩浙一路、自潮汕失陷後、銷塲中斷、市價下沉、予雙馬紗價要美落六七十元之巨、</p>
<p>（三）內地管理嚴格、蜀省一千叫百元抵申一千元、等於打了一七折、係全匯劃可提、茲據調查所得、四川二十支細紗市價僅售一千二三百元、且每包棉紗　往重慶、、水餉關稅保險運費等的計二百元、本埠二十支細紗現售七百五十元、就以上情况論之、運往腹地之紗、非但不能獲利、反見虧耗也、</p>
<h3>關金拆合恐變動　棉商不願廉售</h3>
<p>中外現棉交易絕跡、蓋因價格已遠高境、廠方無亟亟購辦之舉、至於新廠方面、紗價較老廠之紗價低廉百餘元、照目前現棉之價、已入虧耗之途、對於原棉更無必要、交易之淸淡為最大因素也、蘇北來源到通花三百九十六包云、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日匯兌又告緊縮、折合法幣價每擔父高六七元，市上又盛傳下月起、海關之關金折合將有所變更云、因之各同業深慮以後之到貨、稅款有增數倍於五元七角半之可能、故暫時均不願售出、廠方購意略有轉機、不若以前之鬆懈、故日來現貨交易殊為俏俐也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來殊無起色、昨日又因南方套賣及紐奧綸斯之在市賣出、因而市價終日不振、利物浦及孟買之來電又告下落、引起投機者在市活躍、結果收般時較之上日跌六七磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比餘、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　港粵布銷　大見活躍國布</h3>
<p>昨粵·港南洋帮現銷大旺、市勢愈堅、盛銷上列地域之淺色貨漂布·漂斜·花布·蔴紗·洋紡·深色貨籃布·色斜。綫呢·嗶嘰貢緞·羽綢等貨售盤、每疋頻漲一角至五角不等、細斜·粗斜漲一二角、細布平平、惟怡和十三磅十一磅粗布走銷呆滯、囤戶賣出、每疋鬆落一二角、其餘各檔仍穩、粵港帮辦深色貨及細斜三百餘件、川滇帮辦一百餘件、暹羅·新加坡辦淺色布居多、計四千餘疋、甬帮辦粗布嗶嘰色斜五十餘件、本埠染廠需腎較宏、成交染逐細斜·色丁坯·絨坏等貨三百餘件、批發號進零星、門市零剪生意亦淡、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>昨細布·細斜售盤因北帮動辦、市氣轉緊、每疋回升一角半至二角半、天津帮及秦皇島等帮共進七百餘件、本街成交三百餘件、龍頭細布現貨價為十八元九角、期貨十九元二角半、下月份十九元五角、日商洋行會開出細布三百餘件、聞龍頭九月份十九元五角、太鶴現貨十七元五角、嗶嘰叫君子市盤亦昂、昨每碼亦升至五角四分二五、疋頭十八日運烟臺三十件、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債已成弩末　外股反形昂俏</h3>
<p>證劵盤、昨日市况依然疲莫能興、交易愈形沉寂買賣雙方均抱有懷疑態度、多方因謠言太多而不願加碼、空方因檯面做手、瞬息萬變、亦不敢放胆、稍有賣出、即行見跌、檯面祇略有抵補而已、聯和聯益及震康賣出、買進祗鴻康稍有胃量而已、散戶交易極為寥寥、總之公債交易自外匯劇變以來、已成强弩之末、不足為金融界及大戶之一顧、故目前實無多大希望、昨日結果叉小三叫角至一元許、成交總數不過二十萬兀而已、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股五十股、價爲五元四角半</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、因歐局政聞令人氣沮、開盤時價格下游、但不久人心轉佳、信念漸增、交易遂有急遽之進展、午後因下週新交易開始、價格遂益挺進、會德　股異常活潑、價由開盤時之三十二元半漲達三十六元之高峯、蓋大衆展望其上屆末期股息宣布時必甚佳妙也、入後略有回風、至三十五元而止、近頃有數家橡皮公司所宣布之良好股息、無異各公司情况隨將進展之前奏、以目下新加坡幣値向上之趨勢而觀、（新幣一元的合國幣八元）此後各橡皮公司股息之撥發、必能置於遠較前此宏大之基礎上為之、公債市續形萎頓、電力公債成交價為七十三元、</p>
<p>再本報商情一欄、記載獨詳、早為讀者所注意、邇因篇幅關係、不但逐日新聞多所刪節、商情中行市記載凡無所變動或變動甚微者、除於新聞中涉及外、即不為刊載、又如紐的股市等、除市價外、不得已亦時將報告略去、待將來篇幅擴充、自當恢復原狀、更加充實、以副續者之望也、</p>

<h3>丈夫也要向妻子求愛嗎？</h3>
<p>呂急色兒」斷不能享受到人生眞正的幸福，雖然對他自己的妻子。一般人以為在未婚以前，男子為求達到目的起見，可以在她面前許下天大的誓願，可以向愛人百般的獻媚，似乎是無上的誠心虔意。可是等到他倆爬上了一個床舖，成就了燕好，確定了夫婦的身份之後，那妻子就得誠意虔意向她的丈夫求愛了。說要丈夫再不時的向妻子求愛，那就很容易引起人家的笑柄。其實，夫婦之間，斷不是用愛一决，得她的歡心，就可以算了，以後每决在夫婦魚水之歡前，丈夫都應得向她求愛。</p>
<p>動物尙且不像人類這樣蠢，野獸每决和牝獸交尾，一定先有一翻種族上特殊的求愛，如攻擊別的牡獸，以顯示他的强力來刺激她，或振動美麗的羽毛與啘囀的鳴聲來引動她。我們千萬不要忘記，夫婦閒的燕好一决即等於一决的結婚。丈夫的求愛工作決不可少的。因為在婦女的生理上有了準備，不單是為免除她的痛苦打算，就是為了男子也是有益的，不但能增加感情上的愉快，且於夫婦倆的健康也有莫大的裨益！</p>
<p>不過，丈夫欲達此目的，必須性能健康，然後才可以自我控制而復能激發其妻，以達於協調歡暢之境。因此愛情繾綣，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，這是何等的有意義而幸福！可是男子若於早年犯有自凟遺精或婚後的荒淫縱慾，把主宰性能健康的生殖腺液耗損太多，則凡腎萎早洩，發育不全，神經衰弱，精薄不育等症即不一而足，此種丈夫，不要說他不能自動向妻子求愛，恐怕妻子眞的向他求愛時，也難以應付，是以美人恩不能消受，這不特丈夫自巳沒趣之至，妻子亦怎能不痛心疾首呢？由此而演出家庭間之私奔自殺，別居離婚等悲劇者眞是多不勝計！惟上述各症並不是不治之症，自從生殖腺補給療法的成功。更無足憂慮！患者若能積極服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」則於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，滋養神經，常服更能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，不特於短期內可根治各症，并能收延年益壽返老還童之效，惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以制止遺洩，收效允速！</p>
<p>患者趙千里君，浙人，年三十，婚後五載不育，且有早洩陽萎等症，間或有遺精，上月就余診治，乃囑其在永安西藥部購服「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」同服，果於連續服用期月，現已恢復了美滿健康。</p>
<h3>遺精在初秋的療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>雖已秋令，但暑氣未消。所謂「熱昏！熱昏」！暑熱對於頭腦是無益的。一個因遺精而患腦弱症者，則必記憶不良，思想昏沉，時有失眠與脹痛……他的痛苦，旁人是難以了解的！患遺精症者何以致腦弱？因為我人精液中的化學成分，大都為燐與鈣質，這是腦與腎臟及神經的主要原料。且精液在生理學上就是所謂生殖腺液，其中有所謂腦下垂體是直接來自腦部，所以遺精而致精液枯竭者，則腦弱，腎虧，神經衰弱等症即不一而足，頭弱症在熱天最難堪，賢虧症則於天凉後最感痛苦！</p>
<p>何以有遺精？除却生理的溢精之外，大都為春情發動期犯有自續，或早婚縱愁，把性神經斵傷，因此精關管束機能即不能嚴密，初為偶由夢境刺激而遺，繼則每夢必遺或無夢亦遺，或在白日亦遺，那時的精關幾已完全失却了控制。在這樣的情形之下，精液怎能不枯竭，是以腦弱腎虧，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精力渙散諸秤症象即接連而起，不特阻得了靑年的前途，亦且喪失了人生應享的幸福！</p>
<p>遺精在初秋治療，實是比較好的時機。此時天氣已不酷暑，能注意運動，勤用冷水洗滌局部，少看淫書淫畫，極對淸心寡慾，戒絕自凟同時服中外名醫均所推崇之治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」，則即可鞏固精關，當夜能收安眠止遺之神效。如已有腦弱腎虧症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，促進發育，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，能來本診所同時施用電療注射，更可保證痊愈。</p>

<h3>莫因乳峯萎癟陷入慘境！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士與崇培</p>
<p>積極挽救恨海可塡</p>
<p>無論什麼東西，要是大家不識不知，不去理會它，比較它，那倒也是平淡無奇，分不出什麼好歹與優劣的。可是一旦如果給人道破了，而來仔細比較一下。則不但好歹分明，優劣立判，並且還覺得好的似乎更好了，而劣的也更劣了。</p>
<p>現在姑以女子的乳峯發育來說吧。在我們醫家沒有大聲疾呼之前，大家本來不甚注意的。因其不甚注意的。所以很有許多乳峯萎癟的女性，社會人士對之，並不覺得怎樣可憎。及至後來我們在各種醫刋上闡述乳峯萎癟的種種利害，以及學者們的著文倡導。於是男子對於女性的審美觀念，便大大起了轉變。現在不但時代男子們開口便以乳峯高聳，體格健全，作為擇妻標準，即思想較為前進的女性，亦無不孜孜以發育乳峯為唯一要務！誠以人生在世，誰不冀求幸福，若一旦為病魔所侵，或月經不調，營養不良，重症侵害，憂傷過度，致乳峯萎癟，健美喪失。則不特交際場中，無由顧盼生姿，引起識者匿笑。深恐竟由此而擇壻遭遇打擊，或夫婦失歡，釀成種種事變，陷入人生慘境，這更是終身之大憾！欲謀挽救，祇有積極服以生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』，最為劉症而特效，良以此劑由奧國醫聖斯丹那博士積三十餘年之艱辛實騐發明。故藥性最和平，功效最偉大，不論嚴冬盛暑，均可常服，若繼續連服一季，不惟可使萎癟的乳峯，隆然高聳，面頰紅潤，增進健美。且可使體內產生多量新細胞，增强天然抵抗力，百病不侵，常保康寧。</p>

<h3>淋毒性攝護腺炎</h3>
<p>攝護腺居內生殖器之衝要地方，患淋病而不成膀胱炎，或睪丸炎者有之，而未有不患攝護腺炎者。而攝護腺惟一所負之生殖機能，厥爲分泌出一種攝護腺液，此液體必於性交時與精液同時流出，爲涵養精子之要素，無精子固不能生育，但有精子無攝護腺液，同樣不能生育。因精子無攝護腺液，即不能生存故也。</p>
<p>由此觀之，淋毒性攝護腺炎，乃淋病之最易遭遇者，而且亦是最易障礙生育之症狀，故淋病患者，如果一旦續發攝護腺炎，則不可不預防破壞生殖機能，而迅速作有效之治療，始可免去不良之預後。</p>
<p>關於攝護腺炎之療法，現在因有科學上之新發見，將舊日純粹的局部療法，加以廢除，蓋純粹之舊的局部療法——局部手術的療法，不過單調的攝護腺拍摩法，而不知攝護腺按摩法，絶對不能匿藏腺體內之淋菌，一一加以扑滅。故單用局部手術按摩法，從來没有治愈攝護腺炎之事。余以最新之德國濾淋平流電療法，直接從肛門部份插入鄰攝護腺處，按照病情之輕重而施放電度，更以化學療法輔之，能短期治愈，並能保證生育。</p>

<h3>我如何導演「沉淵」</h3>
<p>— （吳江帆）</p>
<p>如果說，「雷雨」是介紹了現實主義的戲劇到中國舞臺上來，那末，「沉淵」將是介紹浪漫主義到中國舞臺的第一部戲劇。這么說關，也許太籠統，太窄狹。（國為「沉淵」的內涵是有着西洋戲劇各派的痕跡）然而，「現實的」和「浪漫的」並非絕對背道而馳，問題是在於作品中「真實性」的有無。自然，用這種浪漫主義的手法稿寫當衣的中國大時代，一定會得到更大的效果，高爾基說現實主義和革命的浪漫主義互相為輔，也正是這個意思。</p>
<p>關於「沉淵」劇本的真正價値，要留待批評家判定，作為一個演出者的我，却感到舊社會舊制度的崩潰，在這劇本中有着頗為深刻的描寫。也許因為故事曲折，使人想到「果報」，「宿命」那方面去，但光明面的描寫概念却是一個更大的原因。因此，在演出上，後者的充實，特別加以强調。</p>
<p>我以為一個導演並不只是劇本的注釋者：把作者的劇本逐字逐句在舞臺上讀出來，介紹給觀眾，他應該努力加强劇本，積極地發揮那劇中的「企圖」。就因為這個原因，我希望觀眾不只是可憐那個劇中人物，應該看得更遠些，這正是不易成功的地方。</p>
<p>我知道有些人對於戲劇的演出特別注意每個有趣味的塲面，有趣味的動作，或是為了形式的美，特意創造了一些舞臺形象。（甚至與全劇演出不統一）對於這些東西，我不想在「沉淵」中嘗試，同時，我在排演時也絕不限制演員做某種動作，（只是不斷地提示那由心理出發的動作）我着重的是那心理的扮裝，變化，使演員整個沒入於角脚色之中。用解釋，反覆訴說使得他們做到。司坦尼斯拉夫斯基建立了演劇的「心理的寫實主義」，昔日「業余」也曾打出同樣的口號，這是正確的，可惜我們完成得太少，離開「主義」這兩個字，還不知道有多少里路，須要努力。但我敢相信「心理的演技」是我們踏上演劇正路的第一步。從心理到生理，沖淡那偶然的，旁枝的强調：那必然的，主要的，這正是現實主義的方法，在文藝上如此，在演劇上也復如此。</p>
<p>在「沉淵」中，我特別强調這種演技，更加以地位的變換，錯綜；以及塲面的緊密，轉化，運用這密切的速度和節奏。</p>
<p>為了本劇的浪漫傾向，演出上也採取一點歧舊的表演方法，我常常把較重的戲放在舞臺中心來演，但當然顧到了現實。</p>
<p>現實的演技，當然是人生的行為的再現。所以第四面牆面，（沒有第四面牆的以及他種演劇當然不在此例）我要演員　有越過幕綫，仿佛故意和觀眾講話。（因臺小，這一點也許不能全做到）在演戲時，不必顧到背部朝向觀眾（當然，大部份還得朝向觀眾）的，轉向得分左右等等初步演劇方法。有幾處，我還特別使用了演員背部的演技，藉以獲得更强更眞實的交果。更有一個地方—采雯（夏霞飾）向思源（徐立）求愛時，我故意呌采雯在他面背向觀眾兜了一個圏。</p>
<p>演技一方面要捨去反射的動作，同時也得避免生理的刺激，演戲如唱歌，由Do（假定是喜）到Ti（假定是悲）有許多高階，而Ti和高音Do又相差毫髪，這正是困難的地方。</p>
<p>泰洛夫說：演戲要和管絃樂化，演員的藝術正是其中一部份。在「沉淵」中，我把演員的表演分做兩種，一種我稱他做「對位的」，另一種我稱牠做「和聲的」，前者是（在某塲面中）使次要表演者取對比的方式表演，無論在臉部表情動作姿態及位置等都如此，後者，則次要表演者是協和地，陪襯地表演。</p>
<p>在佈景，道具，效果，燈光方面，我們也盡量使牠們能帮助表演造成氣氛。做導演本來是件難　，我雖然不同意哥登克巿以為導演必需是精通諸種藝術大家的理論，可是我知道導演畢竟要懂得各種藝術。以我這樣一個淺陋的人，自知是一個嘗試。要有什麼成功，那也是由於演員及技術工作者的努力。至於我自己，還得每個觀眾的指教。</p>
<p>上海劇藝社是個有歴史的劇團，我這一次擔任導演，實在感到異常惶恐，又碰到如此廣大的觀眾，我實在沒有別的話說，謹此有禮，代替鞠躬於脚光之前：</p>
<p>『務請不客氣地批判。』</p>
<h3>失學者的福音</h3>
<p>— 長水</p>
<p>敎育在上海，看來似乎很發逹，很普及。可不是：報紙上學校招生廣告之多，和學校到處林立，就可想見。但是我們放大眼睛來看看，就會知道還有許許多多沒有求學機會的失學　。</p>
<p>這些失學者，大多是學徒，職工，和廣大的勞苦大衆們，他們起初根本踏不進「學府」之門，一入社會，也只得用勞力來噉口飯吃；可是他們並不是不歡喜讀書，他們也知道讀書能了解做人的眞理，和應付事物上的便利；那麼補習吧：補習學校在上海雖算發逹，然在稈度上未免過高，不識字者無從讀起；且學費亦甚貴，非勞工學徒者們所能負擔，於是他們就永遠被擯在學校的門外！</p>
<p>現在，這些不幸者，已漸漸地被人所注意了。據筆者所知，緊接滬東公社學徒夜校之後的第四中華職業補習學校同學會，也着手舉辦中華職工義務夜校，一切辦法和滬東公社義校相仿，（完全免費的）而其可貴黠：就是該義校負責者純侮同學做主體，擔負敎職者，也都是熱心的優秀同學，聽說報名者很為踴躍，超過了預定額，並已於本月初開學了。</p>
<p>我這裏除替一部份不幸者——失學同胞欣幸外，我還希望熱心的敎育界能紛起響應，多辦幾個起來，像這類的義務補習學校。</p>
<h3>江蘇銀行存戶的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 薛浩然上（八月十四日）</p>
<p>江蘇銀行對於游擊區各存戶存款，從上年上月底開始支付以來，所訂辦法，異常苛刻，各地存戶，　不怨聲載道。查廿六年八月，部頒安定金融辦法，係每星期提取百分之五，假定存本一千元，准支九十元，以後雖存本縮少，槪以每期支付五十元為標準，並不因存本縮少，而支數亦縮少。（交通等行均照此辦理）乃該行並不依此辦理，遽照存本餘額核支。譬如存本一千元，第一次支付五十元，下次照存本九百五十元，再照五分之五支付四十七元。（餘類推）所以存本愈縮，支數愈少，又查部章存數僅三百元者，准一次提清。該行又不依此辦理，均須仍照百分之五支付。莫說異地存戶，感覺往返頻煩，損失太重，即住在上海者，亦苦常常奔走，不勝麻煩。又該行每日支款時間，自上午九時起，至十一時止，逾時槪不通融。在此極短時間，凡屬京滬路一帶存戶，乘車來滬者，當日實趕不及，勢必借住旅館，多耗金錢。鄙人原存無錫江蘇銀行國幣九百餘元，當上年十月底開始支付之初，由錫來滬，寓居旅館，每星期往取一次，如是者兩月有餘，嗣因旅費太鉅，提到之款，僅敷膳宿之用，名為提取存款，實則等於無着，即向該行職員商量，有無變通之法，據稱儘可隔數星期併作一次提取。聞言之下，欣慰萬狀，隨時束裝回錫，躭擱兩月，携摺來滬，以為可支八星期之款。迨至該行支款處，乃知行員忽稱最多四星期為度，不能多支。雖再三向他情商，終屬無效。從此烙遵台命，每　一月，來滬一次，現計春　尚餘一百四十餘元。今日為支付之期，共取到二十五元，除去往返川旅費用，僅餘十一元數角。現在統扯計算，原存九百餘元，竟有一半耗在往返旅費中，倘能併兩三　月取一次，以及餘額　三百元者，准一次提清，則損失何至如此。我想各存戶中，對於該行之不滿，同具此呼籲者，決非少數，用特縷晰陳訴，敬求　貴刋不吝一角之地，賜予登入，望該行當局，體恤難胞，悉照部章辦理。則小數存戶受惠不淺矣。此上編輯先生台察</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豓聞忽迎桃葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>但是說也奇怪，在許多追求愛麗絲的同學之中，愛麗絲却和遺位中國留學生成功，有特別感情。這有幾個原因：一則，愛麗絲與成功是同班，每天一同上講堂聽講；二則，成功住的　所，與愛麗絲很近，他們上學下學的時候，常常在路上相遇，一路便談談說說，也漸漸親近起來。而另外一個原因，却是同學中的白種人，往往瞧不起中國人。這種種族之見，每横梗在白種青年的心胸中，尤其那個里昂大學中，貴族出身的子弟很多，就是那班外國紈绔兒實在不少。他們以為愛麗絲是一位法嬌貴的小姐，怎麼可以與黄種人交往。又見他們每晨到學校，又是聯袂楷來。愛麗絲有一輛脚踏車，每天就乘了自由車到學校。成功也有一輛脚踏車，二人在路上相遇時，不是並車而，就是互相追逐。到了學校裏，愛麗絲便把自己的車子，交給成功，一切者不管了。放學的時候，二人有時到公園裏去兜一個圈子，或者把兩部車子，倚在樹邊花下，他們就並坐談天，這樣的情形，看在別個同學的眼中，不免生了嫉妒之心。以為愛麗絲此是愛好了這個中國青年，難道我們許多英挺的少年，全不及一個黄色人種嗎？他們對於愛麗絲，不免在言語之中，有些明諷暗譏起來。且實愛麗絲對於成功，也並沒有什麼十分熱愛。法國的姑娘們，向來活潑自由，舉止大方。她瞧着成功，雖然是位中國孩子，品行却是不差。又兼相貌端正，體格魁梧，不像別個東方國家中人的身體侏儒，形容委瑣，見了人鞠躬屈膝的使人討厭。况且雖然兩人日漸親近，成功從來不曾向愛麗絲求過愛，因此愛麗絲也很器重他。現在因為別的同學，向她有諷刺的言語，愛麗絲心中大大地不高興。她說：便是異性的交際，各人有各人的處由，父母也不能强迫兒女怎麼樣。別說成功是個中國青年，是位黄種人。即使他是個阿比西尼亞人，是一位黑種人，我要喜歡他，也就喜歡他，他人怎能來干涉？愛麗絲小姐這時對於那班同學，不免有些嗔恨，她非但不斷與絕成功往來游玩，反而故意與成功親密起來。（一七一）</p>

<h3>從舞台到銀幕（上）</h3>
<p>— 銀笛筆錄</p>
<p>——袁美雲女士口述——</p>
<p>（編者介紹）袁美雲女士以演悲劇擅長，是中國影壇上的有數人才，而她在未入電影界以前則是一位小女伶，對於戲劇藝衛的體騐較多。今天所刋是袁女士演平劇時的過程，明天起開始記她的從影生活。</p>
<p>自十歲那一年開始，我就從事於舞台生活，我的戲是「二仙」所授，一是李琴仙，一是于蓮仙。還有名栗友顧慕起先生，也曾很熱心的指授過我幾齣戲。</p>
<p>一般人的想象，學戯是很吃苦的，這也許是事實，但在我却是很僥幸，在學戲時期我從來沒有受過鞭笞，甚至呵斥之聲也沒有聽到過，我自幼對於唱戲就感到興趣，這也許是一個主因。在紅氍毺　藝，免不了要走碼頭，在外埠，我到過蘇州·無錫·常州，又到過杭州，而以蘇杭兩地演唱的時間為最久，此外我沒有到過更遠的地方。至於上海，我搭班子的地方可就多了。在丹桂第一台，曾與常春恒劉筱衡同班，在「開天闢地」中演出：在更新舞台，曾與王虎辰同班，演「天下第一橋」綵景戲；在天蟾舞台，曾與麒麟童·小楊月樓·陳鶴峯同班，那時候大蟾演的是「滿清三百年」本戲。</p>
<p>最初與我合作的有我的師妹袁漢雲她唱　生，在外碼頭演唱都是她和我配戲，這時我們都還是童伶，大家呌我們是一對小女伶，但後來漢雲是與我分手了。</p>
<p>我之得入電影界完全是一個偶然的機會，而是出乎我意料之外的，誰知這偶然的機會竟使我拋棄了固有的本能，而改做了電影從業員，由「唱戲生涯一變而為「拍戲」生涯了。這裏，就不能不提到邵醉翁先生。</p>

<h3>「理想夫人」改編的經過（下）</h3>
<p>— 孫樟</p>
<p>總之；莫氏對人類觀察之深刻，全劇佈置之周密，使我得以改編上演，感到莫大的榮幸。我所想盡力做到的，是充分保留原著者的精神，與其特殊的風格，及生動尖刻的筆調，而使其穿上中國服裝，觀眾深信這故事是發生在中國的，是一部中國戲。</p>
<p>也許有人不以翻譯劇本為然，任憑如何改編，總脫不了外國的氣味。不錯；上演創作劇本是目前更重要的仟務，其演出的效果，確在譯作之上，不過；在我們話劇沒有長遠的歷史和成效之前，我們需要從別國舞台各劇上搜索一點，學習一點較成熟的東西。</p>
<p>我們所要考慮的，是劇本本身的價值，對於我們社會習慣及風俗是否相關，而演出後，社會的反響及其效果又如何？雖然不敢有過高的奢望，可是我們不能使之毫無所得！</p>
<p>『L　＇Ecole　Des　Femmes』一劇，以全劇之焦點看來，似乎『理想夫人』最為洽當，所以我大膽的改用了這個劇名。</p>
<p>現在；『中法劇社』格局溝通「中」「法」藝術文化之主旨，繼『原野』後搬演『理想夫人』，因此我得以和本劇的導演舒湮先生商討數次，並承舒湮先生給我許多寶貴的意見，使『理想夫人』生色不少！</p>
<p>末了！『L　＇Ecole　Des　Femmes』劇，可以看作社會劇，也可看作風俗劇，婚姻劇，家庭劇，說它是諷刺也好，問題也好，暴露也好，總之；一個戯之所以能够存在，不是沒有原因的！謹以愛護戲劇的熱忱，向原著者莫里哀氏致敬！</p>
<p>上面是為「中法」公演「理想夫人」特刋，在怱忙中草成的一篇稿子。昨天見到本埠申·新兩報田淑君先生辭去「中法劇社」監督職務的啟事，今天上午又收到舒湮先生給我的一封信，使我約略的了解此次「中法」不幸事件所發生之原因，同時「理想夫人」之繼「原野」上演，也成了泡影，各位演員及導演先生冒着八十度以上之酷熱，十天來排戲之辛勞，均化為烏有。</p>
<p>在愛矆「孤島」劇運的熱忱之下，對「中法所遭受之不幸，感到莫大的悲痛，希望「中法」能在密切諒解，密切合作之下，最短期間，能以更新的姿態，再與我們相見，我虔誠地祝　着。</p>
<p>從書店方面得來的消息，知道「理想夫人」今天出版，在目前所謂劇本荒中，我慚愧地把這本嘗試之作，捧到讀者面前，更希望聰明胡讀者及劇界的先進們，給予我嚴正的指教！</p>
<h3>外片不致絕跡上海</h3>
<p>— 曉春</p>
<p>——補救辦法是普遍漲價</p>
<p>本刋十　日曾載「上海不映外國影片」一文，所述理由，確係實情，由於外滙緊縮，法幣價低，外片在滬上，無利可圖，甚至次等影片，有時連「拷貝」成本，尚難售得，故有外片停運滬上放映之議。但事實上外國片商決不致立即放棄上海巿塲，現已與各影院妥籌補救辦法，即普遍加價是。在影院方面，電力，炭精，煤等日常開支，亦均增加，故亦頗同意將票價略加提高。聞頭輪影院票價將增至自一元起，二輪自四五角起，三輪自二三角起，此舉將於下月（九月）一日起實行，是則海上影迷，不必多所憂慮。至國片所用之底片拷貝，均仰求於外國，成本亦增，放映國片之影院，是否同時加價，一時尚未定奪也。</p>
<h3>慈善伴舞競賽先聲</h3>

<p>上海難民救濟協會勸　會主辦之慈善茶舞競賽大會，停頓以來，瞬已多時，現經虞洽鄉袁履登諸君，向各舞塲經理商討結果，主改為伴舞，而請全巿各舞廳之全體舞星一致動員，參加競賽，由會派員到塲發售慈善福果券，每張一元，可抵舞資。凡參加伴舞之各舞星，即以其所得福果券之多寡，作為成績之標準。分初賽決賽兩種，初賽由各舞廳個別舉行，所有　舞廳之全體舞星，一律參加，得票最多之前十名，即為某某舞廳之十大紅星，决賽各舞廳選出十大紅星後，另行商借適當地點，舉行决賽三天，得票最多之前十名，即為全滬舞國十大紅星·初賽决賽成績，登報公布，以資鼓勵。各舞廳舉行初選時如欲排列表演節目者，事前商請大會恊助，備有各項錦標獎品謝狀外，另向各界熱心人士，徵募銀鼎銀杯等紀念品，分贈參加競賽之熱心舞星，結束時定期舉行隆重給獎典禮，以掦仁風。</p>
<h3>璇宮正式開幕</h3>
<p>「沉淵」榮譽獻演</p>
<p>璇宮劇院自上演「夜上海」以來，觀眾踴躍，各報均得好評，然因適値戒嚴期內不能舉行開幕儀式，故特定於十八日晚間舉行正式開幕典禮，由影界巨子張善琨先生揭幕，陳燕燕女士剪綵，晚塲榮譽獻演林柯先生之「沉淵」，該劇由吳江帆導演，夏霞·維拉·張可·屠光啟·也魯·孫茂雲·沈凌·徐立等合演，在一月餘之排演下，演出成績之優良，當可預測。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>

<p>長腿將軍堂會懸匾與劈匾忙</p>
<p>李張等均不悉該劇劇情，由余先為叙述一過，後即交後台派筆於翌日排出之。劇中以叔岩飾楚荘王，慧生飾王妃，小樓飾唐蛟，長林飾連尹襄老，此劇金殿設慶功宴時，叔岩有大段三眼西皮「勸梓童休得要把本奏上」一折。慧生斟酒時，且歌且舞，有大段二六一折，皆有好腔甚多。小樓於醉後輕狂及醒酒悔罪時，均有很好的作工表情，以後救駕開打尤見精彩。是夜雖大雨如注，彩蓬盡濕，然觀客仍避立於兩廊下佇足以聽，至劇終始散。此次旦行中因梅尚未來，艶秋尚無赫名，故慧生之風頭殊健，况且他和楊余錢王（長林）諸人又都是新明大戲院同夥，大家當然要格外捧他一番。不過在他乘車南下時，忽然夜聞發痧，吐瀉不止，幸有小樓隨身帶來痧藥，給他服下，才算稍為安定一些，及至車抵徐站，衆人下車，不料滿城的車子俱被招待處包去，專備居住城內之各省代表乘坐，當日全體京伶蒞徐，就是勻出幾十部車子來接，結果還是不敷支配，等到硯秋慧生諸人出了站台，已是一部車子無有了。慧生燒了一天一夜，面黄肌瘦，簡直不能行走一步。適巧那天我到車站有點小事，順便到站台上望望，一眼瞧見慧生那副神情，兩個夥計架着他一步一顚的走來。（八三）</p>

<h3>Lead Part of the Troops in Three Routes to Counterattack Guangzhou</h3>
<h3>British and Japanese Troops Confront Each Other at the Kowloon Border, British Gunboats Sail to Reinforce Defenses</h3>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Shandong Recapture Chao County and Fan County; Japanese Counterattack Repulsed</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chinese troops will soon launch a three-pronged attack on Guangzhou from the east, west, and north. Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanhun will respectively lead regular troops and self-defense teams. You Jihanping will lead the guerrilla forces. The counterattack order will be issued by Bai Chongxi from Guangxi. Guangxi's elite forces will also be deployed to strengthen this determined counterattack. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) British and Japanese troops are now facing each other remotely in the Kowloon border area, in close proximity. At the same time, the British side has dispatched two gunboats to nearby bays for vigilance. One is the "Cicada" (蟬) , sailing to Daya Bay, and the other is the "Shipworm" (蠹魚) , sailing to Shenzhen Bay, both departing at 3:00 PM. A British spokesperson also acknowledged this as a precautionary measure. However, the border area is reportedly calm as usual. Only 200 Japanese troops remain in Shenzhen, with the rest having returned to Nantou. (17th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning, everything was quiet along the border. However, British military and police are still stationed at various border posts. A portion of the Japanese troops who occupied Shenzhen yesterday retreated westward towards Nantou at 8:00 AM this morning. Currently, only several hundred people remain in Shenzhen. There was no gunfire this morning. The number of refugees arriving in British territory is quite small, so it is generally believed that the Japanese army is currently preventing residents from fleeing Chinese territory in large numbers. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Hong Kong officials, 600 Japanese troops occupying Shenzhen have retreated towards Bao'an Nantou. Currently, only a little more than a hundred Japanese troops remain in Shenzhen. Fierce fighting has occurred in the Nantou area. A total of 5,200 Shenzhen refugees have sought refuge in British territory and are being accommodated in refugee camps, where things are peaceful. The coasts of Muzhou are still being shelled continuously. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi dispatch: 35 Japanese chemical technicians, 3,000 boxes of toxic gas, and 10,000 anti-gas masks have arrived in Hankou. 5 Japanese transport ships, 1 aircraft carrier, and 100 rubber boats are currently docked at Haikou, with intentions to invade Beihai. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The "Daily Vanguard" newspaper received news from Hong Kong claiming that a Japanese transport ship (4,500 tons) carrying reinforcements from Taiwan to Guangzhou struck a mine near Humen. Japanese soldiers did not have enough time to lower lifeboats, and the ship sank immediately. At least 300 Japanese soldiers drowned. The other survivors were attacked by Chinese guerrillas hidden on the shore while landing, resulting in numerous casualties. The remaining survivors were rescued by Japanese destroyers, narrowly escaping total annihilation. (17th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the fighting on various fronts has been very quiet in recent days. However, the Japanese army seems to be concentrating its forces for a general offensive on Yichang. According to official claims here, the Chinese authorities have instructed the citizens of Yichang to actively evacuate, and the troops have been ordered to defend the city to the death. Currently, the Japanese army is still far away, and the terrain is difficult, so the Japanese army's plan to attack Yichang will not be easy to achieve. (17th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to news received here, the number of Japanese troops in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, has reached about 5,000, causing deep concern among London officials, who fear that Japanese measures to suppress British interests in China will intensify, or even blockade Hong Kong.

<h3>The Incident of Claiming to Be the Assassin of Cheng [Xikun]</h3>
<h3>Has No Further Developments</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Regarding the matter of two Chinese people leaving a letter with Reuters last night, claiming to be the assassins in the Tianjin Cheng [Xikun] case, there are no further developments. The Hong Kong government has not received a similar letter. However, several Chinese newspapers did indeed receive this letter. Each letter was accompanied by twenty yuan, requesting publication in the advertising column. The Chinese newspapers, suspecting the letter, did not publish it. Some people believe that this matter is a trap by related parties, aimed at making things difficult for the Hong Kong government, so that they can accuse the Hong Kong government of harboring the assassins in the Cheng [Xikun] case.

<h3>China and Britain Sign</h3>
<h3>Credit Loan Agreement</h3>

<h3>Councilor Zhang Junli</h3>
<h3>Urges the People to Support National Policy</h3>
<h3>Striving to Save the Nation Under Central Leadership</h3>
<h3>Rejecting All Acts of Splitting the Country</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) National Political Council Councilor Zhang Junli issued a circular to the whole country on the 17th, strongly refuting the fallacies of advocating peace, and urging the people to unanimously support the national policy of resisting Japan under the leadership of the central government. His words on the righteousness of national unity and establishment were very insightful, stating roughly that the principle commonly adhered to by statesmen in modern countries on the day of war is external consistency, which contains three meanings: First, various parties should abandon their usual suspicions and grievances and strive to stop disputes; second, to contribute opinions to the government, so that it can exert its greatest combat capabilities; third, colluding with enemy countries and establishing another government is an act of destroying the country and disrupting discipline, which should be strongly avoided. If this principle is not adhered to, then the country has already fallen into division, so what battle can be spoken of? Indeed, where there is war, there must be peace. However, during the European War, Britain had Lord Lansdowne's advocacy of peace, and once opposed by public opinion, he withdrew his statement. France had Claudius' argument of making a separate peace with the German army, which led to his abandonment by the people and imprisonment. This shows how the principle of external consistency is implemented in modern countries. The government is the supreme organ of a country, and its establishment must come from the country's own strength, without allowing the slightest foreign influence to enter. A little concession becomes a puppet. This is why Liu Yu and Zhang Bangchang are cursed for all time. Now, nationalism is becoming more and more prosperous. How can this kind of painful history be allowed to be repeated? He then said that although the battle results of the past two years have not been fully up to the expectations of the people, the domestic unity is becoming stronger and stronger, and foreign aid is coming. The national character has not fallen to the ground and been exhausted. This is the result of the anti-Japanese policy. Today, the enemy's strength has not been exhausted, but their constrained situation is seen by the world. It is already obvious that they cannot take me and devour me. The government intends to work hard to govern and plan for prolonged resistance. The people must not vainly seek temporary peace for a day, so that they become the continuation of Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, I dare not evade and advise the people to unite under the leadership of the central government to support the national policy of resisting Japan and reject all acts of splitting the country. Only then can we answer the difficulties of our ancestors in building the country for thousands of years and comfort the heroic souls of the martyrs of the Republic of China. I respectfully offer my red heart and hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to achieve it. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Reporters Transferred to</h3>
<h3>Manchurian Border</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese intelligence today, two German communications reporters and one Italian communications reporter currently stationed in Beiping have been ordered by Tokyo's Axis officials to transfer to the border of "Manchukuo." This move clearly shows that the Japanese are preparing for a large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union, so German and Italian journalists must be transferred to that area.

<h3>An Analysis of the Recent Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Heads of state and cabinet members of various countries, those who bear the heavy responsibility of practical politics, and those who are entrusted with the ears, eyes, mouth, and tongue of the people have recently not concealed the extreme seriousness of the situation. There are countless examples of such people and their words. The focus of the problem is the recent developments in Danzig. The various movements related to Danzig are all reported in the newspapers and do not need to be elaborated on by us. Among them, Germany's scathing rebuke of the rumors of a four-power conference to jointly seek a compromise solution serves as a wake-up call to those who are still dreaming of a policy of appeasement. It shows that this problem has already progressed to the last two stages: First, Germany is determined to get it, and only sees which month, which day, and in what way it will be launched. Second, if Poland does not give it up after Germany's launch, it will only have to open the prelude to a world war. The matter is imminent, and disaster is pressing. How it will evolve and how it will tend to return is indeed the great mystery of the world today. I would like to put it aside and first discuss the world's second problem in the minds of Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p>The Far East problem is a part of the world problem; all the changes in the Far East are closely related to the world. Without discussing other things, assuming that China does not resist Japan or resists Japan and collapses in an instant, then the Far East will not become a problem; but Japan will become like a tiger with wings because it has control of China, and Germany and Italy will also combine with Japan and become like a tiger with wings, then Britain and France will either follow China and engage in resistance or follow the footsteps of Czechoslovakia and be slaughtered. How can they still contend for the so-called Danzig problem as they are today! From this point alone, it can be seen that the Far East problem and the world problem are inseparable, and that China's resistance is the mainstay for democratic countries to calmly deal with the world problem. Assuming that the democratic countries had taken the lead in checking the fierce offensives in the Far East and jointly curbing them at the beginning of the invasion, then not to mention the orderly international order, Germany and Italy would not necessarily have launched their offensives so quickly. Even if their ambitions were not restrained, Britain and France could have fully dealt with Europe, and how could the invaders have been as arrogant as they are today. It can also be seen that the reason why democratic countries are frowning today is still that they failed to fulfill their due responsibilities in the Far East in those years, and now they are suffering the consequences. It is only because Europeans and Americans have always regarded Europe as the center of the world; they also thought that on the day the European war broke out, they could not stay out of it, and that they could still stay away from the vortex of the Far East disputes; therefore, the so-called Far East problem was regarded by them as the second problem, but in reality, it was not so at first. Furthermore, as recent developments prove, those who regard the Danzig problem as the current center of the world problem, both sides in the局 have to regard the Far East as an important key in their calculations; then, how is the Far East problem the second problem!</p>
<p>What is the recent situation? (1) The Tokyo negotiations between Britain and Japan have gradually exposed the inherent nature of their contradictions. Yesterday's London telecommunication stated that the British government also acknowledged the slim hope for the future and only sought to avoid the sudden announcement of the breakdown of the negotiations. On the Japanese side, they are both feigning and using the art of capture and release and accusing the British of dual diplomacy, meaning that the British are superficially cooing with Japan, while trying to pull in other countries and waiting for the world to change. (2) The Japanese army in southern China suddenly attacked Shenzhen. Shenzhen is only separated from Kowloon New Territories by a body of water. Since then, the confrontation between Britain and Japan is not comparable to the Shanghai Concession and Puxi, but is like the north and south of Suzhou Creek; bridges can pass, and it is also like the Waibaidu Bridge on the Bund of the Huangpu River; heavy artillery range can threaten Hong Kong. The meaning of this is the threat to the Tokyo negotiations, and it is also an important arrangement for Japan to eliminate the British army, navy, and air force bases in Hong Kong when a world war occurs. (3) The staff meeting of the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow had the Soviet side proposing to demonstrate military strength to the Far East. When the three countries discussed political agreements, the three countries all criticized the implication of the Far East as nonsense. Now, the American Associated Press, the German Haitong News Agency, and the French Havas News Agency all have this news; the authorities of the three countries have no positive expression on this, but they are the most stable and ambiguous, and the British side, which most wants to isolate the Far East problem, has now stopped being indifferent. According to yesterday's Havas News Agency dispatch, "British responsible persons" said that "if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, then the scope of the staff talks of the three countries should be expanded to include the Far East." (4) The spirit and attitude of the Soviet Union in dealing with all problems always fall between "being scrupulous about every detail" and "not being sloppy in the slightest." In short, it does not exaggerate, but it is neither excessive nor insufficient. Now it is said that the proposals they made at the staff meeting of the three countries are like that, and their actual actions include the air force, actual exercises on the Sea of Japan outside Vladivostok, and the army, which is constantly being transported to the Far East. (5) According to some sources, the reporters from German and Italian newspapers stationed in Tianjin have now been ordered to leave Tianjin and go to the outside of Shanhaiguan; newspaper reporters are the first tentacles of the country to observe and listen to the movement.</p>
<p>All of these recent situations are what can be seen in the Far East in the midst of the extremely serious global situation. From Danzig to Shenzhen, from responsible British officials to German and Italian reporters stationed in Tianjin, the relationships are vertical and horizontal, complex and varied, causes and effects, right and wrong, whether they are real or virtual, or credible or dubious, we are indeed difficult to summarize the consciousness and actions of various countries, to pursue the consistent thread, and to judge their inevitable trend; even if we take a step back to analyze all the recent situations, determine which is the main and which is the guest, and weigh how to prioritize, it is still difficult. I would like to choose one aspect of them and extrapolate it: Although the Far East problem takes the Sino-Japanese War as the theme, Britain has a close relationship of interest and pain with it, now close and now far, now brave and now timid, daring not to advance and unwilling to retreat, seeming to sympathize with China in resisting Japan, and seeming to flatter Japan in strangling China. China is determined to resist Japan, and Japan is at a crossroads, so the relationship between China and Britain is very clear, while the relationship between Britain and Japan is full of deception and intrigue. Although the Tokyo negotiations are the theme of the two countries' dealings, their maneuvering is extremely subtle, and it is the question of whether Japan should join the German-Italian military alliance. Extrapolating from this issue, being afraid of the strengthening of the unity of the aggressive group, the rising arrogance of Germany and Italy, which increases the crisis of war if the world has not yet fought, and expands the scope of war if a great war has already been fought, and Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and even India and the Suez Canal are threatened; because of this, it does not want Japan to join the German-Italian military alliance, which is Britain's absolute view, the first. In diplomacy, it maneuvers vertically and horizontally and bluffs; in wartime, the more countries it has, the better, and its naval power ranks between second and third in the world. Its value needs no explanation; because of this, it welcomes Japan to join the military alliance, which is what Germany and Italy expect, the second. Although Germany and Italy's wishes are extravagant, they are willing to settle without war. They have no certainty of victory, so how can they have the determination to start a war. By forming an alliance with Japan, Japan hopes to extricate itself from its predicament and risk triggering a world war, forcing Germany and Italy to help Japan fight because of Japan, which violates its original wish; there will be more bad luck than good luck if there is a war. Even if it wins, its own wounds will be difficult to recover, and it can only watch Japan monopolize the Far East. What enmity does it have with China, but it loses the Chinese market. This is a loss that outweighs the gain; even if it does not fight because of this, it will make Germany and Italy's estrangement from the Soviet Union and the United States even deeper because of Japan. This is bearing a false name and suffering real harm; because of this, the alliance problem that it has been advertising to the Japanese side, and recently it has increasingly expressed its indifference, which is what Germany and Italy are suffering, the third. By joining the German-Italian military alliance, it will deepen its estrangement from democratic countries, and by joining the military alliance, it will deepen the vortex of the European situation, and even stake its navy on the European situation, which is not only unhelpful to the war against China, but also makes more enemies and makes Britain's hope for compromise even weaker; this is the Japanese moderate faction that hopes for a military alliance but hesitates, the fourth. Joining the military alliance will unify the will and strengthen the regime domestically; it will show strength to Britain and make Britain yield; even opening the military alliance into a world war situation, so as to obtain a way out of the desperate situation of the military alliance against China; this is the hard-working spirit of the Japanese youth, who see the military alliance as having a different world, the fifth. This is still a normal evolution. In the European War in the past, wasn't Italy able to benefit from Britain and France by abandoning Germany and Austria? There is no morality in the international community, let alone a precedent; so how can we promote Germany and Italy to the brink of the volcano by today's joining the German-Italian military treaty, agitate the world into a bloody state, and then seize the opportunity to use Germany and Italy to negotiate prices with Britain and France. This will not only trap China in isolation, but also make it impossible to get what it wants from Britain and France; Germany and Italy have fallen into a deep abyss, and Japan is the chosen son; following its precedent, history has the ability to repeat itself in such a cycle; this is also one of the thoughts of those who advocate joining the alliance, the sixth.</p>
<p>From the above analysis, we know the divergence of the future; and Britain, in its contemplation and hesitation, and at a loss, not in the slightly distant future, still has room for weighing the gains and losses, and is only responding to the present, with a single thought of loyalty and loss haunting it.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Opposes Revising the Status of the Shanghai Concession</h3>
<h3>Undersecretary of State Reaffirms U.S. Attitude</h3>
<h3>The Case of the Insult of an American Woman in Tianjin is Being Negotiated</h3>
<h3>The Contract for the Purchase of Aircraft by Japan Was Signed Very Early</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the U.S. attitude toward Japan's proposal to revise the status of the Shanghai International Settlement has not changed. On May 17, the U.S. Congress sent a memorandum to the Japanese side, in which the U.S. argued that the current situation in China is not suitable for considering the Japanese proposal. The U.S. attitude toward this issue has been consistent from beginning to end. Welles commented in detail on various issues in the Far East. He said that the State Department has carefully considered the case of Mrs. Lichtfield being insulted in Tianjin. The State Department has received a detailed report on Mrs. Lichtfield being slapped by a Japanese sentry in Tianjin. Before receiving a reply from the Japanese authorities in Tianjin regarding the U.S. protest, he cannot officially comment on the case, but he can assure reporters that the U.S. government has "carefully considered" the case. Regarding the State Department's approval of the Douglas Aircraft Factory to sign a new contract worth US$1 million with Japan Airlines, Welles solemnly declared that the U.S. government's policy of opposing the sale of aircraft to countries that bomb civilians has not changed. The contract was signed before the U.S. State Department announced its policy. (17th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the case of Mrs. Lichtfield, an American citizen in Tianjin, being slapped by a Japanese sentry, Undersecretary of State Welles recently made a statement to the press, stating roughly that the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, Gauss, has lodged a protest with the Japanese consulate. The State Department is still studying this case, but does not intend to express its views before receiving a response from the Japanese government. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American Douglas Aircraft Factory once sold military aircraft to Japan, which were shipped to that country last month. The American newspapers commented on this matter, expressing dissatisfaction with the government. Undersecretary of State Welles recently made a statement to answer it, stating roughly that Secretary of State Hull advised various aircraft factories last year not to sell aircraft to countries that bomb civilians. This policy has not changed. The contract between the Douglas Factory and Japan was signed before Secretary of State Hull issued his advice. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<h3>Still Stalled</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations have not been opened for the seventh meeting because the instructions from the British mainland have not arrived. British Ambassador Craigie met with Minister Kato on the 17th. Ambassador Craigie said that during the meeting a few days ago, he had predicted that the negotiations could be formally resumed around the 16th or 17th. However, because the economic issues are complex and cumbersome, the mainland government has not yet been able to make a decision on the instructions, so he must ask the Japanese representatives to give him a little more time. He expressed his great regret. Minister Kato expressed regret for the British side's dilatory attitude and urged the British side to take effective and appropriate measures as soon as possible. Finally, the two sides exchanged their final opinions on the security issues on which they had reached a consensus. It is expected that the British-Japanese negotiations will be difficult to resume within this week. (17th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Tokyo negotiations between Britain and Japan, people in the government say that the British position has not changed. In other words, they will not hand over the silver deposited in Tianjin, and they will also refuse to discuss the currency issue in North China. Regarding this issue, the hope for a compromise between the two sides is very slim. The reason why the government has been slow to send instructions to the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, is to avoid the current negotiations from suddenly declaring a breakdown. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, U.S. Ambassador Craigie met with Kato, the chief Japanese representative attending the round table conference, at the Japanese Foreign Minister's residence this afternoon, requesting a further postponement of the meeting. It is heard that Craigie stated that the British government wants to consult with the autonomous region and a third country on the very complex economic issue of Tianjin, so London's instructions have not been issued for a while, but they will be sent soon. In his reply, Kato asked the Ambassador to explore appropriate and effective methods for opening the meeting as soon as possible. It is heard that Craigie and Kato exchanged their final opinions on the issue of maintaining security and order in Tianjin during the talks. It is expected that the meeting may not be resumed before Monday next week. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Consul-General in Tianjin Lodges Written Protest with Japan Demanding Cessation of Anti-British Movement; Chinese Employees of British Firms in Tianjin Go on Strike</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The British Consul-General in Tianjin, Jamieson, today lodged a written protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Tashiro, accusing the Japanese authorities of inescapable responsibility for the anti-British demonstrations occurring in the occupied areas, and demanding immediate cessation. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from this area today, following the strike of 150 employees of the British Shang Company in Jinan, the Chinese employees of the British Asiatic Petroleum Company have also successively gone on strike. Furthermore, according to Chinese newspapers controlled by the Japanese, Chinese employees of other British firms in Jinan will also soon go on strike. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The anti-British sentiment here has greatly subsided due to the inaction of the Anti-British Committee in recent days. Consequently, the Japanese naval landing force guarding the British Consulate has been withdrawn. As for American naval sailors, they are very active here, as one US dollar can be exchanged for as much as 18 "Joint Reserve Bank Notes." Therefore, the sailors are extremely generous in their spending, no longer taking rickshaws but instead riding in cars, and indulging in food and drink without regard for prices. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) People in Hong Kong, both Chinese and British, generally believe that the Japanese military actions near Hong Kong are directly related to the deadlock in the Tokyo negotiations. It is believed here that the Japanese military actions have two objectives: firstly, to coerce Britain into fully accepting Japan's demands regarding the Tianjin incident; and secondly, to cut off the transportation route between Huizhou and Hong Kong. Since the fall of Shantou and Shanwei, Huizhou has become a crucial route for transportation between Hong Kong and Chongqing. If this route is cut off, the blockade of Hong Kong will inevitably be strengthened, as Hong Kong relies on supplies from Chinese farmers, which must pass through this route. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Central Ministries and Departments Will Not Relocate Again</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the rumor spread by the Japanese that the various ministries and departments of the Chinese government, under the orders of Chairman Chiang, would soon relocate from Chongqing to Jiading (transliteration), authoritative sources here have solemnly denied and forcefully stated that such rumors are completely unfounded. It is claimed that most government agencies are currently located in the suburbs of Chongqing and have no plans to relocate elsewhere. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Non-stop Heavy Rain Causes Collapse of Tianjin Outer Embankment; British Concession Flooded, Rushing to Build Embankments; Locusts Swarm in Disaster Areas, Ravaging Dry Land</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A Reuters correspondent, after venturing out to inquire about the local flood situation today, learned that officials are extremely anxious about it, as the water level in the disaster area is currently 18 inches higher than the highest water level of the 1917 flood. The outer embankment outside Tianjin city has now collapsed, and part of the city is already under water. The Japanese concession authorities, adjacent to the settlement, are now building embankments along the border to prevent the water from flowing in. The French concession, fearing being affected, is also building embankments along the border with the Japanese concession and along the riverbank. The British concession, in addition to building embankments along the border with the French concession and along the riverbank, is also building embankments along the former German concession border, fearing backflow of the floodwaters. If the river water flows into the British concession, the affected area will be the bustling commercial district, starting from the riverside and north to Qiangzi River. This area is the original British concession. Crossing the river is the later expanded concession area, which is at a higher elevation and can be spared concern. Sources here say that the next few days will be a dangerous period, as the floodwaters caused by heavy rains west of Beiping, discharged by the Hai River and its tributaries, will reach Tianjin within a few days. Even if they escape the flood now, there will eventually be flooding within the next three months. The Hai River is now level with the banks, with overflows in several places. The British concession is already flooded, especially Victoria Street, where the sidewalks on both sides are several inches deep in water. This is due to overflowing sewers and accumulated rainwater, as the heavy rain has not stopped in the past 24 hours. According to the Hai River Dredging Bureau, the water flowing into the city of Tianjin comes from the ditches of the Jinpu Railway, which are now completely blocked. Looking out from a high place, one can see a vast expanse of water to the southwest of the British concession, dotted with trees and houses. It is said that the water level is level with the Jinpu Railway roadbed, relying only on sandbags for blocking. The authorities have now requisitioned villagers and transported them by truck to the disaster area to carry out emergency rescue work, in an effort to protect Tianjin. Adding to the people's distress, locusts in the disaster area are swarming, gathering on dry land, and devastating fields of crops and vegetables. Tianjin already has a limited food supply, which is now even more scarce. Villagers are now beating gongs and carrying poles to drive away the locusts. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin news: Continuous overcast and rainy weather in the north in recent days, especially in Shanxi Province. There was also heavy rain in Pingjin on the 16th, and transportation on all railways was disrupted. The northern section of the Jinpu Railway has been suspended, and the Tianjin West Station is completely submerged. The east-bound train on the Beining Railway only goes to Changli. The water volume of the Hai River in Tianjin has increased further. The Japanese side has breached several places in the South Canal and Yangliuqing to stabilize the Hai River. Therefore, if the heavy rain in Shanxi Province does not stop, the Tianjin water situation may still be unavoidable in the end. (16th telegram)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Comments on the Significance of the Japanese Army Occupying Shenzhen: Militarily Insignificant; Japan Denies Intention to Blockade Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, Chinese newspapers all prominently reported on the tense situation on the Kowloon border, as British and Japanese troops are now facing each other across the border in Shenzhen. Various rumors of surprise are circulating among the Chinese, with some saying that the Japanese army has already entered Kowloon. The "Shishi Xinbao" today published an article titled "Where is Britain Going?", stating that the Japanese occupation of Shenzhen has no other military value besides preventing vegetables from being transported into Hong Kong. If Britain does not compromise with Japan on the Jianghai Customs, there will be no blockade of Tianjin. Without a compromise between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, there would be no threat of a blockade of Hong Kong today. If Britain still dreams of a peaceful resolution in Tokyo, then there will be no peace in the Pacific, from Australia to the Indian Ocean. All British territories are at risk of being blockaded at any time. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of the Navy today answered questions from foreign journalists regarding whether Japan intends to blockade Hong Kong or cut off transportation between Hong Kong and the Chinese hinterland, saying that the Japanese Navy has no intention of blockading Hong Kong, nor is there any need to take such action. Since Japan occupied or blockaded commercial ports, the blockade in Central and Southern China has been intensified. Therefore, the Japanese Navy does not want to cause international disputes with foreign friendly nations. However, the battle of Guangzhou last autumn was aimed at destroying the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, so as to cut off transportation between Hong Kong and the Chinese hinterland. The current military preparations are to clear out guerrillas and bandits in Guangdong Province, in areas not within the British Concession near the border. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Legal Tender (法幣) Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Recently, rumors have circulated that the government is considering issuing new currency. The reporter specifically inquired about this with a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance today. According to the spokesperson, the rumors are completely unfounded and the government's policy of maintaining the legal tender remains unchanged. (17th telegram)</p>

<h3>Germany Rejects Compromise Solution, Seeks to Annex Polish Corridor</h3>
<p>German Newspapers Promote Polish Anti-German Atrocities; War Preparations Undertaken Along the Border</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler today discussed the latest developments in the European situation with Air Minister Goering and Police Chief Himmler at the Berghof, who went there to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Fuehrer's enlistment as a volunteer. According to political figures here, Germany will consider convening a conference to discuss the technical details of recovering Danzig, but is determined not to convene a conference to discuss whether Danzig should be returned to Germany. The newspapers here continue to publish daily reports of anti-German atrocities in the Polish Corridor, and the issues of the Corridor and Danzig are now gradually being merged. The German "普報" (newspaper) stated, "We must not allow other countries to be the judges of our major issues, as this issue is not only related to Germany's economy, but also involves Germany's honor. The existence of the Polish Corridor is detrimental to Germany's glory." Goebbels' mouthpiece, the "進攻報" (newspaper), also stated, "What we hope to resolve now is not only a European issue, but also includes our demands for colonies. Germany advocates establishing true peace in Europe and will oppose all compromise solutions, negotiations, or conferences. The Polish Corridor and Danzig are Germany's own issues and have nothing to do with others. We will establish justice and peace in Europe regardless of whether Britain opposes it."

<p>(Paris) The French government yesterday sent a note to the US government regarding the developments in the Danzig situation, reportedly worded without expressing great pessimism. After meeting with Foreign Minister Bonnet, Prime Minister Daladier had an hour-long conversation with the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt. Although the French government's semi-official sources said that the matter was not serious, diplomatic circles were very concerned about whether Hitler would take any action on the matter before the Nazi Party Congress, which is scheduled to be held in Nuremberg on September 2nd. The French government indicated that the current crisis in Europe is not more serious than that of Munich. According to unconfirmed reports, Poland has concluded a permanent military alliance with Britain. In the treaty, Britain not only guarantees Poland's independence, but also guarantees the independence of Poland's neighboring countries. These "neighboring countries" may include Lithuania, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, or others. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) After the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Burckhardt, met with German Fuehrer Hitler, some sources reported that the Danzig issue would be resolved by a conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. British officials firmly expressed opposition and said that any international conference without the participation of Poland and the Soviet Union would not be considered. It was also said that no suggestions have been made by any party regarding this matter. The intention of spreading this rumor is nothing more than to make Poland suspicious of the intentions of Britain and France. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax has recently returned to Yorkshire to continue his vacation and plans to return to London with Prime Minister Chamberlain at the beginning of next week to discuss the national situation. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Political figures here commented on the rumors that the Danzig issue would be resolved by a conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, saying, "Any international conference without our country's participation cannot discuss issues related to our country." The various rumors are likely issued by Germany to test the attitudes of various countries. In fact, Poland has always been willing to resolve various issues directly with its neighbors and does not want to involve third countries. The Polish government has not accepted the repeated suggestions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, US President Roosevelt, and Pope Pius XII to mediate the dispute between Germany and Poland, precisely for this reason. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw After Wesner, the leader of the German Germanic Youth Party, was arrested for espionage in the Upper Silesia province of Poland, political figures here expect Germany to lodge a protest with the Polish government. In addition, Polish newspapers published in Germany are often banned. The Polish government is reportedly considering retaliating against newspapers published by the German minority.

<h3>People in Berlin are Anxious and Uneasy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) People in all circles in Berlin are increasingly anxious about the current situation in Europe, and are using the military preparations near the Polish border as a topic of conversation. It is said that all farmers in the border area have been ordered to move their livestock and harvested agricultural products to the interior. Motorized units of the army have also been ordered to carry supplies and depart tomorrow, destination unknown. It is said that the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor will be resolved before the 27th of this month so that Fuehrer Hitler can travel overland to Tannenberg (Dębów, East Prussia) to preside over the commemorative ceremony after the Battle of Tannenberg in the European War, without having to detour by sea. All these claims are inconsistent, and people are anxious and uneasy. In addition, the tone of German newspapers towards Poland is roughly the same as the propaganda campaign conducted against Austria, the Sudetenland, and Bohemia-Moravia. The gist of the argument is that after the Polish issue is resolved, lasting peace can be established in Europe. However, this kind of statement has been seen repeatedly, and a peaceful situation has not yet been established. People in various European countries, having learned from the past, dare not believe it. Some German political figures say that Fuehrer Hitler has instructed Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to issue a statement that once Germany has obtained satisfaction on the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, it may participate in an international peace conference in the hope of breaking up the peace front. If this attempt fails again, Fuehrer Hitler will take appropriate military measures so that Germany's Pomerania province can be connected to East Prussia. However, after Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued the above statement, the initial reaction of Britain and France was rather cold. The London Times even advocated granting the right of self-determination to 8 million Czechs, just as Germany is demanding autonomy for the 400,000 residents of Danzig. The German side was very unhappy upon hearing this, and at the same time, the anti-Polish movement in various newspapers intensified, which is another reason for the general unease here. However, if Germany does take action against Poland, Britain and France will certainly come to the aid of the country they guarantee. Although the German public believes this without a doubt, the government authorities have different opinions, either saying that Germany's military action will be as swift as lightning and Britain and France will be unable to help Poland, or that defeating Poland will take several months, and after the start of the war, the conflict will inevitably spread widely.

<h3>Major Polish Espionage Agency Cracked</h3>
<p>Warsaw A large-scale espionage agency set up by Germany in the Upper Silesia province of Poland has recently been cracked by the authorities, and 70 suspects have been arrested, including 10 Germans. Wesner, the leader of the Germanic Youth Party, is also among them. According to the investigation, the party has indeed maintained close contact with the espionage agency, and a large number of documents concerning Poland's border defense have been seized in the party headquarters. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Katowice According to sources here, as of midnight on the 16th, the number of ethnic Germans arrested in Upper Silesia, Poland, has reached about 1,000, including Jan Jantosch, chairman of the Polish German Workers' Association and former member of parliament. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Oppose Compromise Solutions</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are vehemently opposed to convening an international conference to discuss the Danzig issue and have expressed unwillingness to accept any compromise solution. The Abendpost (evening paper) stated, "The Danzig and Polish Corridor issues involve Germany's honor, and there is no possibility of establishing a compromise solution. Convening an international conference is also absurd." The Angriff (attack paper) stated, "The Danzig and Polish Corridor issues are Germany's issues and have nothing to do with others. Any compromise solution, negotiation, or conference is unacceptable to Germany. In short, we should not rely on Britain's power to maintain the rule of law and peace. If necessary, we will oppose Britain, and we will not care." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Last night, German newspapers were filled with alarming news about Danzig and the Polish Corridor. The Hamburger Tageblatt (Hamburg Daily) said, "According to the will of the Germanic people, solving the Danzig issue is the glory of Greater Germany, and it has become a matter of urgency today." The Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger (Berlin Local Advertiser) said, "From a transportation point of view, the Polish Corridor cannot but be resolved. Today, the ethnic Germans in the Polish Corridor are being abused, which is an insult to Germany's honor." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (German General Newspaper) also said, "Germany is divided into two, and transportation is threatened by the enemy, which is related to our honor." The semi-official Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro (German News Agency) also expressed its views, roughly saying that Germany's honor and vital demands will not allow London and Geneva to interfere and obstruct. Germany believes in rights and power, and does not care about the rest. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>The Danzig Situation Has Not Changed</h3>
<p>(Paris) After Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, recently visited German Fuehrer Hitler, rumors spread that the Danzig issue would be resolved by a conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. Hitler himself and German newspapers have refuted this statement. French officials are not surprised upon hearing this, but say that the fact that German newspapers are now referring to the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues as involving German national honor is making the German people's attitude even stronger, which is worrisome. Fuehrer Hitler is scheduled to deliver an important speech at the memorial ceremony in Tannenberg (in East Prussia, where the German general, former president Hindenburg, defeated the Russian army in 1914) on the 27th of this month, at which time he may present extensive demands, such as connecting German Pomerania province with East Prussia. Regarding this, Hitler originally demanded a strip of land 15 kilometers wide be carved out of the Polish Corridor to build a highway to connect Pomerania with East Prussia. Now it is feared that he will demand that the entire Polish Corridor be annexed to Germany, which is very concerning. The Belgian newspaper "La Nation Belge" reported that the German and Italian governments have suggested to the Roman Catholic Church that European countries should conduct a political truce for 30 days so that Britain, France, Germany, and Italy can hold a conference on the Danzig issue. Now that Germany has rejected this proposal, the news reported by the newspaper is self-defeating. Similarly, US Republican Congressman Schafer intends to propose the same suggestion to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference (currently being held in Oslo, Norway), which will also fail. In short, the Danzig situation has not changed. Britain and France have accepted the commitment to guarantee Poland and will fulfill it when necessary. Among them, Britain's commitment to Poland will be strengthened in the short term. However, the claim that Poland has requested Britain to guarantee the Baltic coastal countries is not accurate. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Advocate Direct German-Polish Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Rome) Roman newspapers advocate that direct negotiations between Germany and Poland are the only way to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Danzig issue. All newspapers unanimously imply that this is due to official authorization. Il Giornale d'Italia (The Italian Daily) says that Poland's independence is not threatened and that Poles have nothing to lose by negotiating with Germany, but if Poles prefer war, then they will "gamble their entire existence." Poles must remember that in a war, Italy will fulfill its responsibility as a member of the Axis. Il Popolo di Roma (The People of Rome) rejects possible conferences or compromises, saying "Yet now several rights do not need conferences, and must make those who demand them satisfied." (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Danzig Troops Scheduled for Inspection Today</h3>
<p>Danzig The first inspection of the Danzig "Heimwehr" (Home Guard), which is composed of special Nazi party guards to increase the police strength of Danzig, will be held here in recent weeks. The unit has 1,500 troops and is commanded by Goetz, the chief of the Nazi Party's special guards. The army organization includes four infantry battalions, one machine gun company, two armored vehicle companies, one assault company, and one platoon each of engineers, signalers, and transport troops. Forster, the Nazi party leader of Danzig, will first present the military flag, then conduct the inspection. Since then, Danzig's military preparations have become more obvious, and infantry maneuvers are held in the suburbs every day. Many of Danzig's youths have been conscripted into the auxiliary police force, and the majority of the positions left vacant have been filled by women. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Border Between Poland and Germany: National Socialist Party Members Provoke</h3>
<p>Polish Police Repeatedly Beaten; Polish Customs Officer from Danzig Arrested</p>
<p>Warsaw: Today, several members of the German National Socialist Party attempted to cross the border into Poland at Buden, a location on the German-Polish border. Polish police immediately intervened and were attacked. German police stood by and did not intervene. Furthermore, two Polish customs officers from the Free City of Danzig were arrested on the evening of the 13th of this month on false charges by the city police, who accused them of secretly transporting anti-National Socialist propaganda. The Polish government, in addition to denying the secret transportation, has instructed its High Commissioner in Danzig, Chodacki, to demand their immediate release from the City Council. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Free City of Danzig: According to German sources, several Polish border guards opened fire on several German journalists near the town of Chiu at 6 PM today. Fortunately, no one was hit. The City Council has lodged a strong protest with the Polish authorities, demanding the punishment of the border guards responsible for the incident. This has not been confirmed by the Polish people in this city, and they claim to know nothing about the protest from the Danzig City authorities. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: A Polish border guard was shot and wounded on the German border on the 9th of this month. On the 14th of this month, another police officer was assassinated by a member of the Germanic Youth League. The perpetrators of both cases have now been arrested by the Polish police authorities.

<p>(Berlin): Leading figures and experts on National Socialist law will hold a meeting in Sopot from August 21st to 25th to discuss Danzig and other Eastern European issues, with particular emphasis on the Danzig dispute. They will attempt to prove that Danzig and Germany's attitude towards the current issues is justified. Representatives from Danzig and National Socialist foreign groups will also attend, and the opening ceremony will be conducted by Forster, the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin): According to the German News Agency, Poland has recently closed a section of the Upper Silesian border near Katowice, preventing approximately 10,000 workers from crossing into Germany to work. The workers' border permits have been confiscated and destroyed. According to another German report, mass arrests have occurred throughout eastern and upper Silesia in Poland. Newspaper reports claim that a man and two women crossed the border at Bautzen, and when a Polish policeman tried to arrest them, a struggle ensued, and the policeman was killed.

<h3>Key Figures from Danzig and Poland Discuss Local Events</h3>
<p>Facilitated by the League of Nations High Commissioner</p>
<p>Paris: The Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, has begun talks today with Greiser, the President of the City Council. Those in charge here are very pleased to hear this, saying that it is due to the mediation of the League of Nations High Commissioner, Burckhardt. The issues discussed are limited to local events in Danzig and do not involve the city's legal status. As for Burckhardt's meeting with the German leader Hitler a few days ago, it was initiated by Burckhardt and was not undertaken with any specific mission, unlike Lord Runciman's mediation of the Czech issue last year. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish High Commissioner to the Free City of Danzig, Chodacki, met with the League of Nations High Commissioner Burckhardt yesterday. At noon today, he also held talks with Greiser, the President of the City Council. He flew back here on a special plane in the afternoon and immediately reported the situation to Foreign Minister Beck. Afterwards, Foreign Minister Beck met separately with the French Ambassador Noël and the Romanian Ambassador Franasovici to discuss the matter. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Inter-Parliamentary Union: Peace Proposal</h3>
<p>American Representative Proposes a 30-Day Political Truce</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway: At today's meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the American representative, Republican Congressman Fish, proposed that the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy observe a 30-day "truce" on political issues to resolve various international disputes through peaceful arbitration, with the President of Switzerland mediating the Danzig issue. The Speaker of the Norwegian Parliament, Hambro, immediately objected, saying that this approach would not be acceptable to representatives of small countries. If this were implemented, we would be in danger of approving a second Munich Agreement. Thereupon, the Bulgarian representative, Yanfordalov, declared that his country's territorial demands on Romania remained unchanged, but if the great powers wished to conduct an investigation, they were willing to accept it.

<h3>Baldwin's Speech: Spirit of Democracy</h3>
<p>If War Breaks Out, the British Will Do Their Part</p>
<p>(New York): Former British Prime Minister Lord Baldwin said in a speech at the Civil Education Conference banquet here last night, "If war breaks out, we will see unprecedented unity and great material resources in the British people. In our hearts, we believe that this war is about fundamental human freedom. We must do our part in this war to achieve our goals." Baldwin continued, saying that democratic governance is the most difficult of all forms of government, because in totalitarian countries, individual citizens do not bear responsibility, whereas democratic countries are the opposite. Baldwin concluded, "All the doctrines we hold are no less than those of totalitarian countries, but our doctrines are nobler and further-reaching than theirs, and therefore success is more difficult. It involves human cooperation according to their free will to cooperate with God to improve humanity." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>German Soldiers Invade French Border, Beat French Customs Officer</h3>
<p>French Foreign Ministry Lodges Protest</p>
<p>(Paris): Regarding the dispute that occurred yesterday afternoon at the French-German border, French customs officer Lixia was beaten by several Germans. This incident occurred within French territory, and the French Foreign Ministry has lodged a protest with the German government. The incident occurred yesterday afternoon between 4 and 5 PM when a German car, carrying several soldiers, drove into French territory near the town of Haining. French customs officer Lixia immediately stopped them, informing them that they were on French territory. Unexpectedly, the soldiers and the driver in the car beat him until he fell unconscious. His handgun and raincoat were also taken away. By the time he regained consciousness, the perpetrators had already fled, so he was unable to record the license plate number of the car. He was also unable to discern which unit the soldiers belonged to. However, Lixia speculated that they were probably deserters. At this time, the examining magistrate of Metz, France, has joined forces with the customs supervisor and the police authorities to conduct an investigation. The German police have also launched an investigation in the hopes of identifying the perpetrators. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Largest Aircraft Carrier</h3>
<p>Launch Ceremony</p>
<p>(London): During the launch ceremony of Britain's largest aircraft carrier, the Formidable, built at a cost of £4 million, an unfortunate incident occurred in Belfast today, resulting in the death of one woman and injuries to twenty others. Just as Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood and his wife arrived at the launch site, a piece of wood fell off the wooden scaffolding supporting the ship. Hundreds of workers gathered under the ship, preparing to assist in launching it, saw fragments of wood falling around them from the large scaffolding and hurriedly fled for their lives. Fortunately, none suffered serious injuries. At the same time, important fragments of wood and iron screws fell into the crowd of thousands of spectators gathered in the specially designated area of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, causing the tragedy. Several tugboats, which were preparing to tow the ship after it was launched, saw the ship moving towards the water and quickly accelerated to avoid it. Officials in charge, seeing that the ship had begun to move, asked Mrs. Wood to quickly throw a bottle of champagne against the side of the ship and christen it the Formidable. The religious ceremony was only held after the ship was safely in the water. According to an official from the Harland and Wolff shipyard, the ship entered the water safely ahead of schedule, and Mrs. Wood was able to complete the launch ceremony before the ship left the slipway, and there was no danger of the ship capsizing.

<h3>French Air Force: Exercises over England</h3>
<p>(London): Several French heavy bombers flew over British airspace last night for exercises and then returned to their country after reaching their destinations. By this morning, another 150 bombers and 60 fighter planes had flown over the cities of southern and central England, Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, and Oxford, for "bombing" exercises, and a "bombing of London" was scheduled for the afternoon, at which time many British planes would take off to intercept them. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London): French air force units "invaded" England twice last night and this afternoon. This is the first time the French air force has conducted flight exercises over England. A total of 200 French bombers participated in the first time last night, all of which reached their destinations and then flew back to their bases, remaining in the air for about seven or eight hours. In the second "invasion" this afternoon, the first plane appeared over London at 1:50 PM. A total of seven bomber squadrons participated this time, and their objective was to attack many important cities, including Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, and Oxford. Reconnaissance planes led the way for the bombers, identifying targets and studying the current situation. These reconnaissance planes later joined up with the bombers over London. British fighters took off to "intercept" them. According to a French communiqué, the purpose of this exercise was to test the formation of light and heavy bombers, totaling 200 from the General Staff, and to simultaneously test the effectiveness of British and French sound detectors and the cooperation of British air defense forces in preventing the advance of bombers. The French Minister of Aviation did not announce the type of aircraft participating in last night's flight, from which base they departed, or the length of the flight. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Five-Minister Conference: Postponed</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The decision on specific measures to deal with the European situation was discussed and decided by the emergency Five-Minister Conference on the 8th of this month. The Five-Minister Conference was originally scheduled to reconvene on the 18th, but because the draft proposal prepared by the Foreign Minister had been largely completed, and the Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Army, Navy, and Treasury had all examined it, but considering the situation from all angles, the draft proposal had not yet reached a mature stage for review, the government decided to postpone the Five-Minister Conference scheduled for the 18th and convene it after considering the situation and the situation has improved.

<h3>Britain, France, and the Soviet Union May Expand Scope of Military Talks</h3>
<p>If Japan Joins the German-Italian Military Alliance, the Scope of the Talks Will Include the Far East</p>
<p>(London): Regarding the talks between the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British and French governments, due to the Soviet Union's request to expand the scope of military talks, will grant broad authority to their respective military delegations. However, British officials say that the rumor that the British, French, and Soviet agreement will extend to the Far East has not been considered. However, if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance treaty, the talks between the staff officers of the three countries will naturally expand in scope to include the Far East. Political figures here are paying close attention to the evolution of Japanese foreign policy. Although the claim that Siam has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact has been denied, Japan's activities in that country have been very active for several weeks, which is noteworthy.

<p>(London): US officials are maintaining a very taciturn attitude regarding the progress of the Moscow military talks. Today, the newspapers have only published that the military delegations of the three countries attended the reception held by the French Ambassador Naziare yesterday evening, with no other new reports.

<p>(London): The staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are conducting talks in Moscow. The fact that Poland and Romania have refused to send representatives to participate is a problem for most people here. Informed sources recently declared that while the military actions regarding Western Europe have not encountered difficulties, the extent to which the Baltic states can cooperate with the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe has become an issue. The British and French governments are exchanging views on this matter and will probably instruct the military attaché of the French Embassy in Poland to make contact with the Polish military authorities. Fortunately, relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have recently shown signs of improvement, and it is possible that Poland may allow Soviet troops to pass through its territory in wartime. In addition, Britain and France will also contact Romania, but the hope of success is probably very slim. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Review of Relations Between Germany, Italy, and Hungary and the German Minority Issue in Hungary</p>
<p>(Berlin): Although German newspapers are trying to downplay the significance of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's talks with Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Salzburg, political figures are paying close attention to them, saying that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had made concrete suggestions and is discussing them this time. Although the content of the suggestions has not been released, Germany is paying close attention to the legal status of the German minority in Hungary. Interior Minister Frick once consulted with the Hungarian government on behalf of the German government. The fact that Frick also participated in the meeting between the foreign ministers of Germany and Hungary makes it clear that the issue of the German minority is the focus of the discussion.

<h3>Hong Kong is Now Armed</h3>
<p>Construction of Air Defense Headquarters – Comprehensive Island Defense</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Recently, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly serious. British military and political authorities are actively strengthening the defense capabilities of Hong Kong and Singapore, paying particular attention to the air force. Additions to the aircraft fleet and the opening of airfields are the most prominent examples. It is now learned that, in view of the urgency of the situation, Britain has dispatched large squadrons of aircraft, such as bombers, fighters, reconnaissance planes, and airships, to reinforce the Far East. The majority of the air force has been concentrated in Singapore. A considerable number of aircraft have also come to Hong Kong. Most of the airships and aircraft in Singapore are capable of long-distance flights and can fly directly to Hong Kong at any time to assist in reconnaissance and combat should war break out. With the current strength of Hong Kong and Singapore's military forces, they are truly capable of withstanding any attack.</p>
<p>Air Force Construction</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities are also striving to carry out air force construction, adhering to the intentions of the British government. The Hong Kong Air Defense Equipment Department, in view of the inadequacy of the current Air Defense Headquarters facilities and the inability to fully develop its work, has petitioned the Hong Kong government to approve the allocation of large sums of money to construct a magnificent Air Defense Headquarters. After detailed consideration, it was decided to implement various plans and commence construction on the 7th of this month. The construction site is located at the foot of a small hill at the corner of Stubbs Road and Morrison Hill Road in Happy Valley. The piling work is currently underway. According to Air Defense Commissioner Mr. Shek Pak Kin, the construction cost of the headquarters is estimated to be about 100,000 dollars. The construction is currently being expedited and is expected to be completed by November 1st of this year. In the future, an air-raid shelter will be built inside the headquarters, capable of accommodating 100 people, to serve as a place for air defense personnel to take refuge during air raids on Hong Kong. The headquarters will also have practice rooms for various staff members, equipped with various electrical machines and telephones, to enable communication officers to practice communication work, so that they can cope with emergencies in wartime.</p>
<p>New Ships Deployed to Hong Kong</p>
<p>While air defenses are being actively constructed, naval defenses are also being strengthened. It is reported that the British cruiser HMS Gloucester, after returning to Chatham from Africa, has suddenly been ordered to East Asia to join the China Station fleet. This ship is replacing HMS Folkestone, which recently returned to England. In addition, Colonel Lee Sharpley Griffin, the commander of the British garrison in Tianjin, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday aboard the troop transport HMS Dilwara and will soon proceed north. It is noted that the former Tianjin garrison commander, Wilson, passed through Hong Kong two weeks ago on his way back to England.</p>
<p>Increased Military Spending</p>
<p>Due to increased tax revenue in recent years, Hong Kong's annual military contributions to Britain have also increased. Military spending in Hong Kong is also increasing year by year. According to an official announcement by the British government, Hong Kong has jumped to second place in terms of military contributions from British colonies. The Straits Settlements contribute the most, at £700,000 per year, followed by Hong Kong at £379,000. India and Ceylon contribute only £216,000 annually.</p>
<p>Military Equipment</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan McIntyre, a reporter for the London Scottish Daily Express, recently passed through Hong Kong to investigate the situation. He telegraphed a report to the Scottish Daily Express, stating in essence that although the British garrison in Hong Kong is small, they will be able to cope calmly in the event of war because of preparations made in peacetime. Hong Kong is about 9,000 miles from Europe. When a shot is fired in Europe, the Far Eastern imperial possessions are immediately affected. Mr. Duncan also stated that he had spent a day traversing all parts of Hong Kong and concluded that Hong Kong is no less than a second Gibraltar. He personally saw the entire island dotted with machine-gun nests, as dense as a beehive, with layers of barbed wire, forming a natural barrier. The cost of deploying defense works this year has reached 500,000 gold pounds, accounting for nearly 20% of total tax revenue. Although most of the coastal areas of China have now fallen, if the Japanese army's strategy of quick victory is unsuccessful, economic exhaustion will be fatal. Recently, they have intensified their anti-British campaign. The Japanese army in Guangdong is only 50 miles from Hong Kong, while Singapore is 1,500 miles away. Therefore, the general opinion is that the Japanese army will invade Hong Kong sooner or later, and it is worrying that the British will not be able to defend it for long. However, according to Duncan's investigation, the British garrison in Hong Kong, except for women and children who need to be evacuated, unanimously expressed their determination to defend the territory to the death, fulfilling their national duty of defending the land. He himself also believes that any powerful country that attempts to attack and occupy Hong Kong, or to subdue it through a blockade, will ultimately fail. Hong Kong is self-sufficient for a long-term defense, which is its military value. A blockade alone can only serve as a warning to the British Empire, but it has little military effectiveness.</p>
<p>Oil Depot Precautions</p>
<p>The Asiatic Petroleum Company has several large oil storage tanks in Causeway Bay, which have been there for many years. In the past, the area was far from the city center and there were few residents. Today, however, the city is becoming increasingly prosperous and the population has grown significantly. More new buildings have been built near the area, and they are often fully occupied. Now, in these tense times, in the event of war and air raids on Hong Kong, the oil depots are most likely to catch fire, endangering the safety of residents in the area. According to the company, the oil depots are not dangerous. Even during air raids, the oil depots are the most targeted by the enemy, but all air defense equipment is extremely tight and can ensure safety. If incendiary bombs are dropped, all fire-fighting equipment is new and can quickly extinguish the fire. Moreover, each tank is individually isolated by solid barriers, so that even if one tank is hit and catches fire, it will not spread to other tanks. If oil flows out of the damaged tank, it will remain within the barriers and will not spread elsewhere. At that time, several anti-aircraft guns will be installed to provide armed protection, ensuring that aircraft cannot fly close to drop bombs, and if they do, they cannot hit the target. Hong Kong currently has a large reserve of kerosene, so there is no need to worry about shortages in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Water Supply Issues</p>
<p>The authorities have also paid attention to the issue of water supply in Hong Kong during wartime. Therefore, in the overall air defense plan, detailed consideration has been given to the protection of reservoirs to maintain the water supply during wartime. A plan has been decided and is being implemented step by step. A complete defense plan is in place to defend against enemy aircraft dropping poison bombs and destroying reservoirs during air raids. At the same time, the authorities are actively seeking ways to utilize the supply of local wells to supplement the water from the reservoirs.</p>
<h3>Pirate Raids on Islands in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Chuan Shi and Da Zhui Islands are Occupied – Lianjiang and Hui'an Counties Also Invaded – Refugees from Pingtan Flee to Fuzhou and Transfer to Northern Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, coastal islands in Fujian Province have been occupied by pirates colluding with the Japanese. These include Haitan (i.e., Pingtan County), Nanri, Chuanshi, Dongsha, Dapai, Dazhui, Nangantang, and Mazu Ao. Among them, Haitan Island is the largest, followed by Nanri Island. However, except for Chuanshi and Dazhui Islands, they have no value in terms of military, political, or economic aspects. Therefore, the Japanese only use pirates to rule these islands and have not sent troops to land. However, Chuanshi Island is located outside the port of Fuzhou, and Dazhui Island is located outside the port of Quanzhou. Occupying these two islands is sufficient to blockade the entry and exit of foreign ships from Fuzhou and Quanzhou. Therefore, they are guarded by the Japanese naval landing force, but the number is not large, only dozens of people in each place, because the area is very small and cannot accommodate a large number of troops. The pirate leader currently active in the eastern Fujian waters is Yu A'huan from Fuqing County, about 40 years old, who claims to be the commander of the joint forces of the three counties of Fu (qing), Pu (tian), and Ping (tan). According to his propaganda, he has a thousand men under his command. Part of his military supplies is supplied by the Japanese (in fact, they exchange it for looting strong men and women), and the food and salaries are entirely looted from the people. A few days ago, he sent more than a hundred men under the cover of seven Japanese planes to invade the Tailing and Beijiao villages in the third district of Lianjiang County. It is found that these villages are all coastal areas, and the residents all make a living by fishing. They transport and sell their products to Fuzhou, and the sales are very extensive. They are wealthy districts in the entire county. After the pirates landed, they searched door-to-door and looted all food, cash, and valuable items. Before leaving, they also took away the fishing boats and fishing nets. After the pirates left, the Japanese planes dropped incendiary bombs wildly, burning down more than 800 houses. Now, these two villages have been completely reduced to ruins. According to the county government report, the losses amounted to more than 500,000 yuan. Moreover, the Taku village in the southeast corner of Hui'an County, where the residents also make a living by fishing, was recently invaded by four Japanese warships carrying more than fifty soldiers under the cover of five planes. They looted extensively and abducted many strong men and women. The joint defense office, primary school, and slightly larger houses were all set on fire. After this disaster, all the residents of the village have moved into the county seat and suburbs. After Pingtan County was occupied by pirates, the residents, unable to bear the harassment, have been crossing the sea to flee to the territory of Fuqing County on the opposite shore. They have been sent by the county government to Fuzhou for temporary shelter and will be transferred to Qingliu and Mingxi counties in northern Fujian to engage in reclamation. According to reports, although the puppet maintenance association in Pingtan County has been established, the puppet chairman, Zhang Qingju, and the secretary, Cai Kenan, are both local bullies who run opium dens and gambling houses, so they have no power at all. The pirates levy donations and demand salaries in the county seat, and they loot at will in the villages. There are no Japanese soldiers on the island, only two Japanese women who direct the actions of the puppet association and the pirates and communicate with the Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Baiquan in the Min River by radio.</p>
<h3>List of County Magistrates Announced by the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>

<h3>Japanese Army in Guangzhou Plans to Enter Shameen to Arrest People</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Rejected by the British and French Concession Authorities – Japanese Troops Can Only Cause Trouble at the East and West Bridges</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Guangzhou has been repeatedly requesting to search and arrest so-called dangerous elements in Shameen, but has been strictly rejected by the British and French concession authorities. Unexpectedly, a team of Japanese military police even attempted to break into the East Bridge of Shameen yesterday, claiming to arrest wanted criminals at a certain hotel. The French concession guards closed the bridge gate tightly, ready to fight. At the same time, British, American, and French warships anchored in Bai'etan also raised fire and were on alert, and the situation was very serious. The Japanese army, seeing the strong attitude of the Shameen authorities, did not dare to rush in. Instead, they sent a small number of soldiers to station around the East and West Bridges of Shaqi, harassing the Chinese and foreigners entering and leaving Shameen. Currently, most of the Chinese who work in Shameen dare not go to work, and foreign residents in Shameen also rarely go out.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane in Taizhou Catches Fire and Burns After Touching Electric Wires</h3>
<p>Three Planes Crash in the Fields</p>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: At 5:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, four Japanese planes took off from Yangzhou and flew directly towards Taizhou and Xinghua in the northeast. Before reaching Taizhou, they suddenly encountered a heavy thunderstorm. Three of the planes immediately caught fire and burned down, crashing in the fields of a village 30 miles away from Taizhou. The remaining plane immediately returned to Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Xitang Town, Jiashan County Bombed by Japanese Planes</h3>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: At 7:00 AM a few days ago, six Japanese planes flew from Jiashan Airport to Xitang Town, Jiashan County. They dropped more than 20 bombs on Tangdong Street, Zhongtang Bridge, and Wanfu Teahouse, the busiest areas of the town. At that time, the farmers were gathering in the market and were caught off guard. More than a hundred people were killed or injured. Hundreds of shops on Tangdong Street, the essence of the town, were turned into ruins. For a time, women and children fled for their lives, vying for escape, and their cries shook the sky. Many jumped into the market river and drowned.</p>

<h3>Japanese Spokesman Declares: No Blockade of Shanghai Concessions Imminent – Situations in Shanghai and Tianjin are Different and Require Separate Consideration – Newspaper Articles Appear Provocative</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that a Japanese spokesman stated yesterday (the 16th) at a press conference that there is no danger of the Shanghai International Settlement or French Concession being blockaded by the Japanese army today or tomorrow. Such measures depend entirely on future events. Based on the current situation, there will be no events that will make the blockade of foreign-administered areas here inevitable. When asked whether European developments would affect possible Japanese actions here, the spokesman said that Asian events are unrelated to the European situation. After numerous questions from reporters, the spokesman made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Actions Depend on Disregard</p>
<p>The Japanese army has occupied the Shanghai area for nearly two years. In the Tian-Craigie Agreement, Britain acknowledged that the Japanese army had to take certain measures for its own protection. However, the current situation in Shanghai requires a kind of factual acknowledgment. If activities supporting Chiang Kai-shek that are detrimental to military interests continue unabated, the Japanese army will have to take a new stance. What will trigger this new stance is a question of the extent of the activities.</p>
<p>Blockade Rumors Dismissed</p>
<p>When asked what impact any Tokyo compromise would have on the Shanghai situation, the response was that the situation here is different from the current situation in Tianjin and requires separate consideration. The issue of blockading the British and French Concessions has caused great anxiety and has led to widespread rumors of a possible blockade. These rumors must be dismissed. The spokesman explicitly stated that a blockade is possible, but not necessarily happening.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Actions to Stop Arms</p>
<p>Regarding reports that the International Settlement and French Concession are preparing to deal with a possible Japanese blockade of the city, senior officials of the two concession administrations have denied this, calling the suggestion "too ridiculous to be worth commenting on." When asked if reports that supplies from southern China via Hong Kong were also being blockaded were true, the Japanese spokesman replied that the current Japanese military operations near Hong Kong are part of a coastal blockade to prevent weapons and ammunition from reaching the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Court Documents Not Allowed to Be Published</p>
<p>When asked to publish the details of the Japanese note to the French Concession Bureau regarding the courts, the spokesman said that the note was merely a response to the French side's suggestions on the matter. The Japanese side found the suggestions unsatisfactory and could not publish the details of the note. When asked if rumors that the French authorities suggested establishing a mixed court were true, the response was "If we answer this question in the affirmative or negative, we will reveal all the details."</p>
<p>No Military Solution</p>
<p>When asked if the Japanese side would resort to force if negotiations failed to transfer the courts, the spokesman said that he could not answer. A reporter continued that the Japanese newspaper "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" stated today (the 16th) that there were only these two options. The response was that this may be the newspaper's opinion. A reporter said that the "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" has close ties with Japanese officialdom, but the spokesman smiled and did not say a word.</p>
<p>Newspaper Articles Appear Provocative</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the more moderate Japanese newspaper in Shanghai, "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," stated in an editorial yesterday (the 16th) that the Japanese authorities should immediately take control of the Chinese courts in the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession and shut down banks affiliated with the Chongqing government. If Japan does not take these steps, enemy activities in the foreign-administered areas of Shanghai will intensify and be their own fault. If diplomatic talks fail, the use of force to take over the courts in the French Concession is a "firm determination." Many disputes may arise if the French authorities do not recognize the new situation in Shanghai and act in good faith.</p>
<p>The Special District Court and Chinese banks are organs of the Chongqing government and operate openly in the two concessions. Court personnel are appointed by Chongqing and apply the laws of the Chiang regime, which is evidence of "enemy activities" in the foreign-administered areas. The courts must be administered by the Japanese or "Reformed Government" authorities; otherwise, the hope of establishing peace in the foreign-administered areas is like trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. Chinese banks obtain funds in the Shanghai foreign-administered areas to finance China's</p>
<p>Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>And negotiate the purchase of military supplies to support General Chiang. Many other organs of the Chongqing government, under the protection of the two concession authorities, plan to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army and use these areas as a base for hostile actions against Japan. The Japanese government "cannot tolerate" the open existence of the courts and the four major Chinese banks. The Japanese authorities will immediately question the two concession authorities on how to deal with the 3,000 to 8,000 Chinese soldiers and their weapons who retreated into the concessions. It is reported that a large number of</p>
<p>Detained Chinese Soldiers</p>
<p>Have been released and their weapons handed over. It was a "mistake" that the Japanese side did not take over all the organs of the Chinese government when Shanghai fell in 1937. The stage has now been reached where this action should be taken immediately. The Japanese government determined its policy towards the National Government on January 16 of last year. The new regime has gained the power to take over the Chinese government's organs in Shanghai without further hindering the rights of third countries.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Fares to Increase – Application Filed with the Municipal Council – Talk of Another Tram Fare Increase</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 16th), it was learned that the British-owned China General Omnibus Company has applied to the Municipal Council for permission to adjust fares in order to increase its bus fares in the International Settlement. Since the Municipal Council has already approved the tram company's fare increase, it is widely believed that the Council will approve the bus company's application. The Shanghai Tramway increased its fares on June 9. What the extent of the bus fare increase will be, and on what date the new fares will be implemented, if approved, was unknown yesterday. However, it is generally said that the bus company's application seems very normal, given the sharp increase in gasoline and kerosene prices. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the China General Omnibus Company experienced increased business due to the increase in population on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek,</p>
<p>More than compensating for the losses on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, and therefore did not increase fares. At the same time, it is widely believed that the Shanghai Tramway will apply for another fare increase. A representative of the tram company replied to inquiries, saying that they were currently considering this move, and that "there is good reason for this move."</p>
<h3>British Consular Court Rejects Case of Four Chinese in Tianjin – Claims Petitioner is Not Acquainted with the Chinese – Lawyers Reportedly to File Successive Appeals</h3>
<p>Regarding the extradition of four Chinese in Tianjin, after Mr. Licks, a British lawyer from the Ellis Law Office in Shanghai, submitted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the British Consular Court in China based on a telegram from London, the consular court judge, Jones, after several studies, according to Western sources in Shanghai yesterday, decided on the case yesterday morning</p>
<p>To Reject It</p>
<p>It is heard that the reason for the rejection is that the original petitioner failed to state the facts of the case, and only requested legal remedies based on the information he had obtained. It was deemed that the reasons for the petition were not sufficient, and therefore the above-mentioned judgment was given. According to other sources, the petitioner will</p>
<p>Continue to Appeal</p>
<p>The final appellate body for such cases is the British Privy Council. In addition, The China Press reported that the British Consular Court in China this morning (the 17th) rejected a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by Chinese terror suspects detained by the British authorities in Tianjin. It is heard that the defense lawyer for the case will</p>
<p>Appeal the Court's Decision</p>
<p>And will continue to appeal, if necessary, until the case is appealed to the British Privy Council. Judge Jones' judgment stated that the defense lawyers for Mr. Fulan and Mr. Bianwei petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued to certain police officers and prison officials in the British Concession of Tianjin, ordering them to immediately bring the four Chinese detained in connection with the Tianjin assassination of Cheng on April 9 of this year to the court for questioning. The defense counsel appeared</p>
<p>Four Defendants' Names</p>
<p>Irrelevant Notice. However, the names of the prisoners must be confirmed and drawn into the writ. If the form is not complete, it is doubtful that I can issue this writ. The petitioner on behalf of the four Chinese is only a person who is unacquainted or volunteers, and has no right to represent the prisoners in court, and may not petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Moreover, this petition does not have the necessary</p>
<p>Prisoner's Statement</p>
<p>Or a statement from someone authorized to represent the prisoner, or a statement explaining that the prisoner was oppressed and unable to make a statement, but only the lawyer's statement based on his own information, knowledge, and belief. Therefore, this petition must be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Control Determined Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>The Japanese side had posted notices in Pudong, intending to transport vegetables from Pudong to Hongkou for sale, implementing a disguised form of control. This move changed the day before yesterday and was not implemented. It is understood that the matter was entirely the work of low-level Japanese personnel colluding with local tyrants in Pudong, hoping to profit. The Pudong Navy had already approved it, but the Hongkou side was afraid that bad people would take advantage of the opportunity to disguise themselves as vegetable vendors and cause trouble, so they did not agree. As a result, the initiators of this plan all failed. It is heard that their ambitions have not been quelled and they are still secretly trying to smooth things over.</p>
<h3>Pacific Hurricane Dissipated – Temperature Reached 93.7 Degrees Yesterday – First Hot Day After Autumn</h3>
<p>The newly formed hurricane near Guam in the Pacific Ocean has evolved to the point of dissipation after being stagnant yesterday. There are no new winds rising in the Pacific. The highest temperature in Shanghai yesterday rose to 93.7 degrees, the first hot day after autumn.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Pilots Killed – Wrecked Plane Still in Fields Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, at around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 16th), a Japanese military plane was practicing aerobatics in the western suburbs of Shanghai when it suddenly crashed near the Xujiahui Railway Station south of the Zhongshan Bridge due to mechanical failure. Three pilots were killed instantly. Fortunately, the plane was not carrying explosives, so the residents were not harmed. The bodies of the pilots have been taken away by the Japanese side. The wrecked plane remained in the fields yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Four-Line Isolated Army's Supply Situation: A Statement from Commander Xie; Supplies Previously Provided by Local Charitable Organizations; The Shanghai Municipal Council's Advance Payment Has Been Reimbursed by the Government</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Xie Jin'yuan, commander of the Four-Line Isolated Army, issued a statement regarding the army's supply situation, offering clarifications. The statement is as follows:</p>
<p>The National Government Has Repaid the Funds and There is Still a Surplus</p>
<p>(1) The Sihang Warehouse is close to the concession, and bullets and shells are flying about, causing concern for the lives and property of people in the concession. We received instructions from the Consular Body resolution, which instructed the British and American naval and military commanders to request our highest authorities to order a withdrawal. From October 31st, 1937 (Republic of China Year 26) to November of last year, our supplies were provided by local charitable organizations. From December of last year to August of this year, a total of nine months, I borrowed 4,500 yuan from the Shanghai Municipal Council each month, totaling 40,500 yuan. I issued formal receipts for all of these. The Shanghai Municipal Council requested the Chinese government to reimburse the advance payment. In April, the Council received 43,600 yuan. The statement that "not a single penny of funding was paid" is untrue. The Chinese government still has 3,100 yuan at the Shanghai Municipal Council. (I plan to write another article in the future to share the detailed situation with the world).</p>
<p>There are Precedents in Public Law and History</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly cite one or two examples of international law and historical precedents. Article 11 of the Fifth Part of the 1907 Hague Convention on the reception of troops of belligerent powers by neutral countries stipulates that "Neutral Power may allow interned officers to pledge their word not to quit its territory without permission, and may leave them at liberty to choose their place of residence, subject to any regulations which it may be necessary to impose upon them". Article 12 stipulates that "Unless there is a special convention to the contrary, the neutral Power must supply the interned with the food, clothing, and lodging required by humanity. The expenses of internment shall be made good at the conclusion of peace." The most notable historical example is the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, when Switzerland received over 80,000 French soldiers and 10,000 warhorses, and France had to reimburse Switzerland for maintenance expenses totaling as much as 11 million French francs after the war. During World War I, Switzerland received troops from both the Allied and Entente powers. Switzerland felt overwhelmed with the expense of providing maintenance, and the number of people was impossible to count.</p>
<p>Xie's Statement: Reasons for Withdrawal</p>
<p>(2) But I must state first that our withdrawal at the request of a third party cannot be equated with desertion. (3) Whether reimbursement is possible in the future is not something I can say today. However, some people, seeing that the Shanghai Municipal Council is facing financial difficulties, are acting as alarmists, speaking without holding back. I believe that what they really want to say is that the Hongkou District of the Public Concession should be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council as soon as possible, and the various restrictions around the Concession should be lifted promptly, so that the Shanghai Municipal Council's depleted financial resources can be somewhat relieved.</p>

<h3>The Fate of Jewish Refugees En Route to Shanghai Still Undecided; Discussions Between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Consulate Yield No Results; If the Japanese Side Does Not Accommodate Them, They Will Be Denied Landing</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the fate of the 500 Jewish refugees currently en route to Shanghai remains undecided because the meeting between Miura, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, and Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of housing these refugees in Hongkou has not yielded any agreement. The matter is currently under</p>
<p>Consideration by Both Sides</p>
<p>And no further meetings were held yesterday (the 16th). Yesterday (the 16th) was the deadline for Jewish refugees in Shanghai to register with the Japanese authorities to reside and do business in Hongkou. If the Japanese side strictly implements its memorandum of July 10th, those arriving in Shanghai will not be allowed to stay north of the Suzhou Creek. According to reliable non-official sources, Fessenden pointed out during his meeting with Miura that there is a shortage of housing south of the Suzhou Creek, and expressed hope that the Japanese authorities would</p>
<p>Grant an Exception</p>
<p>For the 500 people arriving in Shanghai in the coming weeks to reside north of the Suzhou Creek. "But if the Japanese authorities do not agree to allow those arriving to reside north of the Suzhou Creek, then there is a clear possibility that they will be denied landing, as it is expected that the Shanghai Municipal Council will not allow these people to reside south of the Suzhou Creek." When reporters asked members of the refugee care committee here yesterday, they all declined to comment, only expressing the hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities, who are very sympathetic to the plight of these refugees, will allow those</p>
<p>En Route to Shanghai</p>
<p>To disembark here. According to Japanese sources last night, a certain ship returning to Japan from Europe arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 64 Jewish immigrants who disembarked. After that, no more immigrants were allowed into Hongkou. Since the first group of 223 Jewish refugees arrived on an Italian mail ship on September 23rd of last year, the number of Jews in Shanghai has increased to about 15,000.</p>
<h3>Reinforcements Added to the Blockade Line on North Jiangxi Road; Only Haining Road is Passable; Some Shops are Closed</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side blocked the eastern side of North Jiangxi Road from the Molai Bridge northward to Baz Road on the 29th of last month with barbed wire and wooden frames, leaving openings at Chongming Road, Wenjianshi Road, and Haining Road, at the intersection of the Northern District of the Public Concession and Hongkou, only Chongming Road and Haining Road were passable after the special precautions taken for the two-week anniversary of the Shanghai Battle. Moreover, people entering and leaving the intersection of Chongming Road and Jiangxi Road must have a permit and a vaccination certificate to pass. If they only have a permit, they still cannot pass. Therefore, in reality, only Haining Road is passable. Yesterday, twenty to thirty men and women were seen detained in the barbed wire at the western entrance of Chongming Road because they did not have a vaccination certificate. The rest were not allowed to enter or exit and were turned back. The shops along the eastern side of the road within the blockade line were seen yesterday handing things to each other through the barbed wire, which was quite inconvenient, so some shops have closed down. Also, because the barbed wire on the wooden frames there was very thin, the Japanese soldiers were seen yesterday adding wooden stakes and iron nets to the defensive works along Baz Road south to Tiantong Road.</p>
<h3>Konstantinoff as Acting Soviet Consul-General; Consul-General Simansky on Leave; Office Temporarily Headed by Konstantinoff</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently received a notification stating that during the leave of absence of B.M. Simansky, the Soviet Consul-General in Shanghai, all affairs of the Consul-General's office will be handled by M. Konstantinoff.</p>
<h3>Surcharge on Foreign Postal Remittances; Set at 100%; To be Implemented Next Month; Temporary in Nature, May be Cancelled in the Future</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, Shanghai has just received news that postage for mail sent to foreign countries will soon be double the current rate, while domestic postage will remain unchanged. It is reported that from September 1st, a "temporary exchange surcharge" of 100% will be levied on overseas postage. The post office will not double the postage, as it will be simpler to restore the original rates when the postage returns to normal. This measure seems overly analytical, but its effect is the same. The reason for the surcharge is that postage is calculated at the same value when converted into various currencies. Postage is based on the gold franc as the standard. Previously, the legal tender was equal in value to one gold franc. Currently, the gold franc is worth more than 2.5 yuan in legal tender. The authorities are levying a surcharge to not make legal tender equal to a gold franc, but to increase the current postage by one hundred percent, so that it can be calculated. Implementation will begin on September 1st. So far, only telegram notification has been received. Shanghai is expected to receive the complete written order in two or three days, at which time an official announcement will be published in the newspapers. This news was learned from the postal authorities today.</p>
<h3>Significant Results Achieved After Domestic Remittance Management; Inland Remittances Reduced from Over 100,000 to 20,000-30,000; Remittance Amounts Strictly Limited; Remittance Fees Significantly Increased</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented management of domestic remittances, significant results have been achieved, and capital fleeing from the interior to the occupied areas has been greatly reduced. Recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Effects of Managing Domestic Remittances</p>
<p>A reporter from Datong News Agency learned from the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau that before the implementation of domestic remittance management in Dongchuan, Xichuan (i.e., Sichuan), Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, and other places, the total amount of money remitted to Shanghai each day was over 100,000 yuan. However, since the implementation of management, it has been reduced to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Is this not a good effect of management?</p>
<p>Remittance Amount Reduced, Remittance Fee Increased</p>
<p>Previously, 1,000 yuan could be remitted from the interior to Shanghai each day, then it was reduced to 500 yuan, and then further reduced to 200 yuan. Since the implementation of management, only 50 yuan can be remitted. The remittance fee for remittances from the interior to Shanghai has also increased from 5 to over 10 cents per yuan to 15 to 46 cents. Even the remittance fee for remittances from Zhejiang to Shanghai has increased to 11 cents.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Minister Talks About the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Times, the Norwegian Minister to China and Japan, Colban, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 16th) on the President Cleveland. Regarding the Far East situation, he only stated that "the Chinese war is something no one can predict," and declined to offer further criticism. Minister Colban will stay here for a few days before returning to his home country for a long vacation. Mr. Colban is quite concerned about the current state of trade between Norway and Japan. It is said that Japan imports more Norwegian products than it exports. Norway's exports to Japan are mainly wood pulp. Mr. Colban clearly stated that his visit to Shanghai had no purpose, and he only wanted to meet with private friends before returning home. The affairs of the Norwegian Embassy in China are being handled very well by the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai. According to reports, Mr. Colban had previously decided to come to Shanghai to take office in January of this year, and is now scheduled to travel to Europe on the Xianghuosituo on August 21st.</p>
<h3>Fractional Currency Notes Printed and Delivered; To Be Issued in the Near Future; Notes Belong to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank; May Be in Circulation Within the Next Week</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, ordering the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank to issue one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank that the first batch of 500,000 yuan, including 300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes, has been printed and delivered in full since the printing contract was signed with the Wing Ning Company of Hong Kong. The notes belong to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank for regular issuance. The issuance date and procedures are still to be determined by the bank, but it is likely to be within the next week. As for the design, the front has the words "Central Bank of the Republic of China Year 28" and a pagoda, marked as one cent or five cents.

<h3>Shipping Companies Establish a Transfer Bureau in Zhenhai</h3>
<p>After the Ningbo Defense Commander specially approved the resumption of navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, because the gap in the Zhenhai blockade line has been blocked, ships such as the De Ping, Si De, Mou Fu, Hana, and Yingzhou, which operate between Shanghai and Ningbo, have all changed their mooring to Qiliyu outside the Zhenhai Estuary. Goods and passengers are all transported by barges. Shipping companies and Ningbo authorities are very concerned about the safety of the barges. It is reported that the Zhenhai Ferry Bureau has been organized by shipping companies and has started operations since the 14th of this month. The announcement is as follows: This bureau, in order to ensure the safety and speed of passengers traveling to Shanghai, has specially released a dedicated ship. Starting from the 14th of this month, at 5:00 PM every day, it will pick up passengers traveling to Shanghai from the Tangsai Wharf on the Jiangbei Bank and sail directly to the Zhenhai Estuary. However, passengers must first purchase tickets at the bureau's office to board the ship. Those holding transfer certificates from various shipping companies can use them to offset the price. In addition, every day after 6:00 PM, it specializes in ferrying passengers out of Zhenhai. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>After the Opening of the Black Market for Cotton Yarn, National Yarn Transactions are Active; Demand Exceeds Supply, Prices Increased Yesterday; No One Consults the Japanese Exchange</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn black market transaction, after yesterday's announcement limited to three major principles for careful trading, immediately secretly instructed market supervisors to strictly implement it, and decided that anyone who had a few unstable customers should be eliminated. This aroused the enthusiasm of the market, and everyone unanimously turned to the national yarn. The mutual need was very strong. Unfortunately, there was a limited amount of spot goods, which eventually led to a situation where demand exceeded supply, and the price of national yarn also rose. The prices of various yarns from various factories all rose yesterday. As for the general transactions in the market, they were thoroughly national spot yarn, and there were</p>
<p>Foreign Yarn Transactions</p>
<p>Occasionally, a few transactions were completed in secret, but they were all secretly negotiated outside the market or in tea parties, which was beyond the control of the black market authorities. The method of changing new certificates for black market members is purely a necessary measure. Although speculators may sneak in afterwards, their bad tricks will be difficult to use, because a new transaction method has been set, which can</p>
<p>Reveal at Any Time</p>
<p>Its mistakes. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter, who learned from relevant parties, the cotton yarn exchange that the Japanese have been actively preparing to organize recently was originally intended to attract legitimate merchants into their trap, but because the manufacturers are well aware of the righteousness, they generally</p>
<p>Refuse to Cooperate</p>
<p>The rumors that some Chinese have joined the exchange as brokers are all fictitious. Although the location has been decided in the former Gold Exchange on Jiujiang Road, it is still a castle in the air. According to general observations, the exchange will definitely not be realized. The main reasons are: (1) The yarn factories in various parts of Japan have</p>
<p>Too Many Soldiers</p>
<p>On the Service, and the Productivity Has Been Reduced by 60% to 70%; (2) The Products of the Japanese Yarn Factories in Shanghai are Used to Control the Sales Channels in the Occupied Areas, and Have Been Directly Transported to Various Places by the Japanese Factories, and the Local Sales Volume Has Been Greatly Reduced; (3) After the War, the Sales of Japanese Yarn in China, Because the Chinese People in Various Places Have Already Made the Determination to Sever Economic Relations with Japan, and No One Will Use Japanese Yarn. Although Some Small Cloth Factories in Shanghai Had Previously Decided to Use It, the Sales of Japanese Yarn Have Also Been Affected Since National Yarn Has Been Selling Well.</p>
<h3>New Beijing Ship Operated by Butterfield &amp; Swire Returns the Cargo to Shanghai; Original Shipment Returns</h3>
<p>The new Beijing ship of Butterfield &amp; Swire, a British company, loaded cargo from Shanghai on the first day of last month and went to Xinghua, Quanzhou, Xiuyu, and other places in Fujian Province. However, Xingquan was banned by the Japanese army early on, so after arriving in Quanzhou, it was blocked by the Japanese and could not be imported. After several weeks of negotiations, it still</p>
<p>Could Not Get Anywhere, the Cargo Could Not Be Unloaded, and It Sailed to Xiamen Under the Company's Order at the Beginning of This Month. A Small Portion of the Cargo Was Unloaded in Xiamen, and Most of the Flour and Other Cargo Was Returned to Shanghai on the Original Ship. It Has Returned to Shanghai at 2:00 PM Yesterday.

<h3>Portuguese Merchant Tong Sai is Planning to Transfer Ownership to German Merchant; May Join the Shanghai-Ningbo Route; The Two Parties Are Currently in Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, American Huamei Shipping Company manages four ships of Portuguese merchant Tong Sai, Tong Qiao, Tong Bei, Tong Lu, etc. After three of them, including Tong Qiao, were successively detained by the Japanese side this spring, the Portuguese Consulate has repeatedly negotiated, but there has been no result. Tong Sai, which has not been detained, has been suspended until now due to fear of repeating the same mistakes and is still moored at the buoy. However, the expenses are quite large, and the buoy fee alone is a huge amount, resulting in irreparable losses. According to reporter inquiries, the company plans to transfer the ship to a certain German shipping company to join the Shanghai-Ningbo or other routes. The two parties are currently in negotiations.</p>

<h3>The Inside Story of the Violent Assault Case in Zhaofeng Garden the Night Before Last is Complex; The Victim's Employer Lost a Handgun and Bullets; The Two Perpetrators are Highly Suspected</h3>
<p>At around 9:30 PM the night before last, four men suddenly violently assaulted another man named Qin Houxing next to the Zhaofeng Garden Zoo at the end of Yuyuan Road, and at the same time, they wrapped a rope around Qin's neck, intending to strangle him. Fortunately, Qin shouted loudly for help, causing several British Indian troops stationed next to Zhaofeng Garden to immediately cross the bamboo fence to the scene.</p>
<p>Qin was Rescued</p>
<p>At the same time, Zhou Wenqing from Changzhou and Zhang Xiaoer from Shanghai (both 18 years old) who were committing the crime at the scene were arrested and reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese detective Xie Futang rushed to investigate and brought Zhou and Zhang to the police station. Although Qin Houqing suffered injuries to his nose and face, they were not serious, so he was discharged from the hospital after being bandaged by Tongren Hospital. According to Qin Hou and the police station, he was working as a servant for an Englishman named Wei Shudeng at No. 621 Xiafei Road. At 3:00 PM on the 16th, two friends, Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen,</p>
<p>Came to Linger</p>
<p>For a long time, and then invited him to visit Zhaofeng Park together, so he went with them. In the park, he met Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer again. Unexpectedly, while playing until about 9:00 PM, Chen took out a rope and wrapped it around my neck. At the same time, Zhou and the other three punched me, seemingly wanting to kill me, but the reason is unknown. Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer claimed that Chen Guoyuan and Qin Lixing were all friends. Yesterday, Chen ordered them to beat Qin. It is learned that Chen once introduced a woman named Jin Bao</p>
<p>To Qin for Intimacy</p>
<p>But I don't know why the two had a dispute over this matter, which evolved into what happened a moment ago. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Zhou and Zhang to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, and stated that although the defendants claimed that the cause was due to the woman Jin Bao, the fact is difficult to believe. This morning, the police station received a report from Qin Houxing's employer, stating that his</p>
<p>Three Handguns</p>
<p>And one hundred bullets were suddenly stolen on the 16th, and Chen Guoyuan and Zhang Xiaoer, who were at large on that day, had been at the Westerner's house for a long time, so the cause of this case is definitely not so simple. The police station still needs to conduct a thorough investigation, so please postpone the hearing of this case. After Judge Meng Tingke questioned Qin Houxing and the two defendants, he ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for another week.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Applies for Divorce Mediation; And Demands 10,000 Yuan in Alimony</h3>
<p>A man named Wang Yiche, currently residing at No. 6, Tingyuanfang, Lane 281, Fuli Road, married Yan Shaolin, a woman from Jiading (26 years old this year), eight years ago. The relationship between the two was initially quite harmonious, but in recent years it has become like ice and charcoal. Yan recently filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Court of the Second Special Court, applying for divorce mediation and demanding 10,000 yuan in alimony, as well as the return of a gold ring, diamond ring, gold watch, and rhinestone ring, as well as a pair of pearl bracelets and a real stone. The reason is that the opposing party, Wang Yiche, wrote a letter of repentance on January 30th of this year, promising to quit bad habits and break away from mistresses, etc., but has not fulfilled these conditions and has often abused the petitioner, so she has no choice but to demand a divorce. According to the court, the case was mediated yesterday in the Fourth Civil Court by Judge Yang. The opposing party, Wang Yiche, did not arrive. After reviewing the case, the court recognized that the mediation was unsuccessful and could be filed separately.</p>
<h3>Teacher's Wife's Baby Dies After Childbirth; Claims Doctor Was Negligent; Infant's Umbilical Cord Protrudes, Mistaken for a Blood Tumor; Actually Liver Development, Surgery Causes Death; Petition to the Court Prosecutor's Office to Verify Corpse</h3>
<p>Yu Datong, 34 years old this year, from Shangyu, Zhejiang, currently residing at No. 542, 5th Floor, Hatong Building, Nanjing Road, is a teacher in the Northern District Primary School established by the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council.

At 12:30 PM on the 16th,</p>
<p>A Male Was Born</p>
<p>Both mother and child were safe. Mr. and Mrs. Yu were overjoyed, but the base of the baby's umbilical cord felt slightly protruding, similar to a tumor. They summoned Dr. Huang Jiaxi and Cui Zhiyi, surgeons from the hospital, to examine the child. After the examination, they insisted that it must be cut open, to prevent bacteria from entering the abdomen and endangering the child's life. Mr. and Mrs. Yu were eager to save their son, and after being instructed by the doctor, they agreed to sign for the operation to save the little life. They then signed the form, and at 3:00 PM that afternoon, Dr. Huang and Cui first took a film of the original state before</p>
<p>Cutting Open</p>
<p>It Turned Out that the Infant's Disease Was Not a Blood Tumor, But Only Special Development of the Liver. Another Film Was Taken, and at 4:30 PM, the Two Doctors Asked to Cut a Piece of Flesh from the Mother to Repair the Infant's Wound. At About 8:00 PM that Night, the Child Died. The Child's Father, Yu Datong, Mistook the Death of the Child as the Fault of Doctors Huang and Cui, and Considered the Child as a Research Sacrifice for Them, and Was Not Satisfied. Therefore, Yesterday Morning, He Filed a Lawsuit with the Second Special Court, Describing the Previous Situation in Detail, and Accused the Two Doctors of (1) Misdiagnosis; (2) Time Prolonged Due to Filming, Resulting in Tragedy; (3) No Way to Remedy, But to Make the Mother</p>
<p>Cut Flesh to Patch the Wound</p>
<p>And What Was Cut Was Insufficient to Patch the Wound; (4) Unskilled Surgery, Ignoring the Injury. He Requested That Personnel Be Sent to Verify the Infant's Body and Then Prosecute According to Law. The Court, According to the Lawsuit, Endorsed the Report to the Police Station, Requesting Review. Yu Followed the Order and Reported to the French Police Station Yesterday Afternoon, Requesting Investigation. The Police Chief Sent a Detective to Investigate and Sent the Infant's Body to the Mortuary Attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital (Small Ward) on Tiras Telegraph Road, Awaiting the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office to Send Personnel Today to Verify and Handle the Case.</p>

<p>Yesterday Morning's High Tide</p>
<p>Yesterday morning's high tide, which began around 1:30 AM, exceeded the Shanghai Dredging Bureau's forecast by thirteen feet, one and five-tenths of an inch.

The Zhejiang Industrial Bank's warehouse was still clearing water that had entered within the threshold.</p>
<p>Rapid Huangpu River Current</p>
<p>At the height of the high tide, the current of the Huangpu River reached a speed of 2.4 knots, making it quite difficult for sailboats to navigate. Moreover, some civilian boats struck the riverbank and were pushed onto the shore, creating a peculiar sight. The Bund warehouses and the Jianghai Customs, among others, had flood defenses in place yesterday.</p>

He received the payment and delivered it to the accounting department. After the accountant examined it, he discovered a five-yuan banknote from the China Industrial Bank's Qingdao branch. He immediately instructed Song Xifan to return and exchange it. Kang Sheng refused to acknowledge the banknote, and an argument ensued, followed by a physical altercation. Song, outnumbered, sustained minor injuries and left disgruntled. Shortly thereafter, Song gathered six or seven toughs, armed with iron bars and other weapons, and swarmed into the factory. As a result, Wang Shuchun's left eye was injured, Wang Zhenxiang lost a tooth, and furniture and other items were damaged. $330 in legal tender also went missing from the accounting desk.

<h3>"Anti-Smoking Bureau Chief" Zhu Yao Exposed for Embezzling Public Funds</h3>
<p>Zhu Yao, the current Acting Director of the bogus "Central China Anti-Smoking Bureau," was able to secure this position with the support of Chen Zemin, the bogus "Governor of Jiangwu Province." From the moment he took office, he traveled to various locations to announce his "anti-smoking policy," but in reality, he engaged in excessive taxation and extensive plundering. As a result, land prices in various counties of Central China skyrocketed. In July alone, the bureau's unexpected income from price increases exceeded one million yuan. After a small portion was used to cover official expenses, the remainder went into Zhu's private pocket. It is now known that this secret has been discovered by a certain party. Knowing that his position is insecure, Zhu recently took an early morning train to Suzhou to meet with Chen Zemin and Hao, the "Finance Director," for lengthy secret talks. He then hurriedly returned to Shanghai. The outcome of this trip remains unknown.</p>

<h3>Bogus "Judicial Department" of the "Provisional Government" Establishes Bogus Court in Western Shanghai; Allocates $2,400 in Establishment Expenses</h3>
<p>After the "Provisional Government" organized the so-called "Shanghai District Court" in this city, it experienced little activity and had no cases to handle.

It is now known that the "Court" recently received instructions from the "Provisional Judicial Department" to "increase revenue." It is now actively planning to expand its scope to increase income.

Its elaborate scheme is readily apparent. The "organization" of the court is generally prepared, and the "Provisional Judicial Department" has allocated $2,400 to cover the establishment expenses. The "court address" has also been located at the China Bank Villa, 623 Route Corneille. It will open on September 1. Residents living in the villa have already been notified by the Japanese Military Police Detachment stationed in western Shanghai to relocate. It is rumored that the "Branch President" will be Lu Qi, a lawyer commissioned by the "Provisional Court of Justice" (Lu's original name was Fuqi, and his courtesy name was Qihua, from Taicang County, Jiangsu Province). The "Chief Prosecutor" will be Qiu Zhun. The area under its jurisdiction will be limited to the area of the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai, from Yinghua Lane on Route Robert to the Shanghai-Xujiahui Railway in the south, and from Route Conty and Yanping Road (including Route Bubbling Well) in the east to the Shanghai-Songhu Railway in the west.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Intense Gunfire in Western Shanghai: Large Gang of Bandits Robs Cloth Factory; Over Ten Bandits Arrested, One Bogus Policeman Injured</h3>
<p>Around 1:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 16th), a large-scale robbery occurred in Yaojiajiao, Route Brennan, in western Shanghai. It has been learned that the Shenyuan Cloth Factory, located at 14, has been operating for many years. On the morning in question, a large gang of over thirty bandits, each armed with box cannons, pistols, and knives and sticks, swarmed around the factory and scaled the walls to enter. Four bandits were left to keep watch. After entering, the remaining bandits took control of the people inside the factory and openly carried out 300 bundles of yarn, one spindle, two yarn files, and other items, loading them onto parked vehicles. Afterwards, the bandits escaped with their loot towards Panjiaku. At the time, the Japanese side and the "Great Way Police" received the news and rushed to the scene. They encountered each other near Xiaoshiqiao. The bandits preemptively opened fire, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle, exchanging over two or three hundred shots. After fifteen minutes of intense fighting, the bandits were overwhelmed and scattered. One bandit, Chen Weigong, was captured on the spot, and several vehicles of stolen goods were also seized. Yesterday, more than ten bandits, including Yuan Zhisheng, Yao Fuchun, and Zhang Jianlong, were arrested one after another.

<p>The case was previously heard by Judge Miao Qingbang, who ordered the defendant Wang Zuolin to post bail of $8,000 pending further hearing. Yesterday afternoon, around 3:00 PM, Judge Miao held a special hearing in the case. The plaintiff and defendant, both accompanied by lawyers, were present to await the hearing. The plaintiff, Liang Yong'ao, stated that in the summer of the previous year, under the name of Yunhua Yarn Company, he purchased 29 bales of Blue Sky Horse brand six-count yarn from the Minghe Yarn Factory owned by the defendant Wang Zuolin and paid the price. The yarn was stored in the Minghe Factory, with warehouse receipts as proof. He also ordered 250 bales of Tianma brand yarn from the Minghe Factory under the name of Xinfeng Yarn Company and paid a deposit of $980, but the goods were never delivered. Therefore, the plaintiff's 29 bales of yarn were embezzled, valued at $8,700, and the deposit of $980 was defrauded. The losses suffered by the plaintiff due to the defendant's embezzlement and fraud amounted to $31,250. Therefore, he requested that the court not only punish the defendant for the crime he deserves, but also order the defendant to return the deposit and other fees, amounting to approximately $40,000. Then the defendant Wang Zuolin testified that the 29 bales of yarn sold to the plaintiff had already been delivered to Xue Jinmeng, a shareholder of Yunhua Yarn Company, and that the plaintiff was not a shareholder of Yunhua Yarn Company and had no right to file a lawsuit. As for the order from Xinfeng Yarn Company, the defendant did not intentionally fail to deliver the goods, but rather because the factory was in Beixinjing and suffered significant losses due to the Shanghai war. The defendant had no intention of fraud and requested that he be acquitted. The plaintiff's attached civil claim should also be dismissed. Furthermore, the plaintiff has committed false accusations and requested that he be punished according to the law. The court, noting that both parties held differing views, questioned witnesses You Xiansheng and Zhang Deqing and determined that the facts were clear. The court ordered the start of the debate, with lawyer Wu Peng representing the defendant providing a detailed defense. The hearing concluded, and the defendant Wang Zuolin remained on the original bail of $8,000. The verdict is scheduled for August 22nd.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, According to the party concerned, Jiang Zhongji, a news item titled "Jiang Zhongji Construction Factory Owner Ignores Mortgage" was published in the Shanghai News of this newspaper on the 16th of this month. After investigation, the content is inconsistent with the facts, and the story is exaggerated, with apparent ulterior motives. After investigation, the mortgage was transferred from Anji's account, but in order to enhance credit in the middle, the property certificate was used as collateral. However, for this mortgage, the creditor was notified in advance to prepare funds for liquidation before the due date. The dispute between the two parties is not about the issue of deferred remittance versus cash. There is absolutely no situation of delay or ignorance. It is inappropriate for the creditor to suddenly interfere with the court. At that time, no newspaper reporters were present to record the proceedings, but the newspaper suddenly had this record, which was obviously being used by someone. Please issue a letter requesting correction to avoid confusion. Yours sincerely, Zhu Yisheng, Attorney at Law, to the Editor of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Whether Public and Private Elementary School Principals Not Teaching Classes Should Be Exempt from Military Service; Zhejiang Department of Education Should Issue Instructions for Interpretation</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, according to the presentations from public and private elementary school principals throughout the province, seeks instructions on whether public and private elementary school principals not teaching classes should be exempt from military service. The Department of Education specifically explains that according to Article 13 of the Elementary School Law, elementary school principals should also teach classes. Schools with a larger number of grades may have full-time principals, who should also teach classes as appropriate. Township- and village-run elementary schools may, out of practical necessity, have principals who do not teach classes, but these principals should be limited to those township or village heads who possess the qualifications for principal as stipulated. Township and village heads are all eligible for military service deferment, so no issues arise. For private elementary schools, matters concerning fundraising and all financial matters should be handled by the board of directors. The position of principal should be filled by the board of directors appointing a teacher to serve concurrently. Separate principals who do not teach classes should not be appointed. Previously, according to the reports from various county governments, private elementary school boards of directors were instructed to have the chairman serve concurrently as principal. This order should be strictly followed. This instruction is issued for compliance and implementation.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Shaoxing High School, Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>(Shaoxing News) Shaoxing High School, Zhejiang Province, is located in Shaoxing, the foremost front line of the eastern theater. The school has been in a precarious position since the fall of western Zhejiang. After the fall of Hangzhou, there was a proposal to relocate. Afterwards, as the situation gradually stabilized, Principal Jin Xiang and the majority of the faculty believed that the school would suffer significant losses in terms of spirit and material if it were to relocate. Therefore, they decided to continue classes as usual at the original Cangqiao address within the city, without interruption. However, to guard against unforeseen circumstances, a temporary school site was selected in a rural area eighty miles from the city, as a place to relocate if necessary. Last semester, the school had over 600 students, an increase compared to before the war. During this year's enrollment, the number of applicants exceeded the number of admissions by more than ten times, an unprecedented record that was beyond expectation. To intensify the training of students to meet the needs of wartime, the school specially organized a Wartime Education Design Committee to formulate a Wartime Education Implementation Plan, divided into three types: physical training, productive labor training, and wartime rear service training. Physical training includes ball games, martial arts, swimming, bicycles, equestrianism, mountain climbing, and cross-country running. Productive labor training includes chemical crafts, weaving, and agronomy. Wartime rear service training includes military engineering, nursing and first aid, intelligence, propaganda through drama and opera, and singing. It is stipulated that each person must select four hours of study per week for each type, totaling twelve hours. Furthermore, the school, recognizing the low level of knowledge among the public and the difficulty of promoting national salvation efforts, established a large-scale Wartime Public School within the school. The school requested the county government to instruct the three towns of the city center, west, and north to send students to the school. All out-of-school members of the public in the towns must be forced to enroll in phases. The first phase, with 250 people, has already reached its quota and has begun classes.</p>

A swimming pool was specially built half a mile from the college, with two changing rooms for men and women. The opening ceremony was held last Saturday. All the male and female students, except for two who were unable to attend due to illness, stood in the water in orderly rows. The president waved his hat to give the order, and for a moment the water splashed and the sound was like thunder. Performance programs included horse riding races, swimming speed contests, underwater pot picking, tug-of-war, water buffalo wrestling, and forming the letters NTC (National Teachers' College) in the water. More than half of the faculty and staff also participated, performing diving and lifesaving skills. At 7:30 that evening, teachers and students held a social gathering with many performances.

<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Remain Severe Initial Sharp Tightening Followed by Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices were announced with no changes. Although the dark market for British and American currencies initially favored a certain party's absorption, some American banks were still willing to sell, resulting in only a slight softening of the situation. After 10:30, due to continued favorable absorption, Sassoon and other foreign firms also came to buy and close positions. In addition, HSBC came to buy, so although Hong Kong Electric and some American banks successively released, the supply still felt insufficient to meet the demand, so the situation gradually tightened. At one point, the British gold was the tightest, once exceeding 3 pence 34375. The American exchange rate also once called for 6 and a half yuan. However, although Hong Kong Electric stopped selling at noon and switched to buying, foreign banks were still willing to sell, so it was not affected. In the afternoon, Sassoon suddenly came to give back, so the situation became more stable. As a result, the British gold closed at 3 pence 40625 and the American exchange rate closed at 6 yuan 625. The 8 and 9-month futures also followed the same steps, with the British gold tightening by 09375 and the American gold softening by 1875, but the 8 and 9-month swap spread remained the same as the previous day. The overall transaction was mediocre.</p>
<p>Favorable Buyers Quite Active</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large strips, both near and far, shrank back by 25. New York's silver price suddenly rebounded slightly. London's raw gold remained unchanged. In terms of exchange rates, the British pound was flat against the US dollar, the French franc, and the Shanghai currency. The US dollar was still flat against the British pound, down 2 jiao against the Shanghai currency, and down 125 against the French franc. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3 and a half pence for British gold and 6 yuan 8125 for the American exchange rate, with no changes compared to the previous close. After opening, some American banks initially sold spot British gold at 3 and a half pence to other banks. Then Datong sold spot American exchange at 6 yuan 75 to favorable parties, which was slightly softer. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no ups and downs, and the silver balance tax was still exempted. After that, the market situation was still flat. Around 11:00, because favorable parties continued to absorb for a certain party, Sassoon and foreign firms also came to buy slightly. Although Hong Kong Electric had come to throw out, foreign banks were reluctant to sell, causing the market to continue to soften. It is estimated that favorable parties, foreign firms, and Sassoon absorbed spot British gold at 3 and a half pence to 4375 from Hong Kong Electric and some American banks, and spot American exchange at 6 yuan 6875. Then Sassoon also bought British gold for the current month at 3 pence 375 from foreign banks. Later, HSBC closed spot British gold at 3 pence 375 with other banks. At that time, some American banks also suddenly absorbed spot American exchange at 6 yuan 625 from Chinese merchants. After that, the British gold was the softest, calling for 3 pence 34375, and the American exchange rate was the tightest, calling for 6 and a half yuan. Near noon, although Hong Kong Electric stopped selling and switched to buying, foreign banks were still willing to sell, so the situation gradually flattened. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric closed spot British gold at 3 pence 375 and spot American exchange at 6 yuan 5625 with foreign banks. By noon close, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 375 for British gold and 6 yuan 5625 for American exchange.</p>
<p>Sassoon Gives Back in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The afternoon market was quite flat and trading was sluggish. However, Sassoon came to sell slightly, so the situation rebounded slightly. It is estimated that Sassoon sold spot British gold at 3 pence 40625 and spot American exchange at 6 yuan 625 to foreign banks. By the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 pence 40625 for British gold and 6 yuan 625 for American exchange. British gold for the current month was 3 pence 34375 and American exchange was 6 and a half yuan. British gold for September was 2 pence 96875 and American exchange was 5 yuan 75. As a result, compared to the previous day's noon close, the current period British gold tightened by 09375 and the American gold softened by 1875.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Again</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 17th The opening was stable today. The British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate fell slightly by 1 yuan to 413 yuan. At 10:40, the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 4 yuan to 417 yuan. At 12:30, it rose again by 11 yuan to 428 yuan. There was no change at 2:30 pm. At 3:30 pm, the Shanghai exchange rate fell back by 3 yuan to 425 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 11 yuan for the whole day.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Also Shrinks</p>
<p>Tianjin, 17th The exchange market opened weakly today. The exchange rate against the British pound shrank by 125 to 2 pence 75. The exchange rate against the US dollar tightened by 25 to 5 yuan 375. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 4 yuan to 124 yuan. The "Lianchao" dark market rose by 2 yuan 4 jiao to 97 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Many Hidden Reefs in the European Situation Cash Surge Slightly Frustrated Calculate at 600-700 Yuan Based on Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash 'cooked red' dark market situation was slightly mediocre, but the trend was still erratic. It generally fell first, then rose, and then fell back, all based on the foreign exchange trend as the target. Initially, it inherited the fatigue from the evening of the previous day, and the foreign exchange was very flat at that time, so the morning opening fell to a low of 4,480 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange reported tightening, causing a buying spree. Some gold shops, on behalf of speculators, and some banks, on behalf of foreign banks, successively made aggressive advances. However, there were quite a few retail investors coming out, and silver shops and cash shops all had hedging sales, so although the price soared to a peak of 4,640 yuan, there were quite a few twists and turns along the way. Later, because the foreign exchange slightly rebounded, there was a gradual lack of buyers, and it plunged straight to 4,565 yuan. The closing result only rose by 15 yuan compared to the previous day, so the gold price calculated based on foreign exchange became more and more divorced (British gold was 5,204 yuan 7 jiao, and American exchange was 5,285 yuan 3 jiao), actually pressing down by 640 to 720 yuan. According to inquiries, there are three reasons: (1) There are still many hidden reefs in the European situation; (2) The exchange rate discount is still high; (3) And recently, the exchange market interest rate has reached a monthly interest of 1 jiao. However, this arbitrage is very risky, so there are many wealthy merchants in this city who abandon this and turn to that, which has hindered the surge in gold prices. The total transaction was about 1,000 taels. The result of silver shop jewelry gold was neither good nor bad. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>'Cooked Red' Rises 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), because the foreign exchange was still flat and people were still tired, the opening was similar to the late closing of the previous day, and the official price was 70 yuan lower than the previous close. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange shop, priced at 4,480 yuan. After opening, because it was heard that the foreign exchange was slightly softer, there were more buyers, and the market situation suddenly turned strong and expensive, hovering near the 4,500 yuan mark. At about 9:50, the situation became stronger because the money exchange shop's buying intention suddenly became stronger, rising by 60 yuan. A securities shop sold 30 taels to a money exchange shop, priced at 1,560 yuan. At that time, some gold shops and silver shops competed to sell, and the price fell back down. Soon, it was pressed down by a small 45 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 50 taels to a silver shop, priced at 4,515 yuan. At about 10:00, it was heard that the foreign exchange was quite prosperous, so the situation was gradually softening, causing the gold market buyers to also come one after another. Sellers did not come forward, and it jumped straight up. Before long, it soared by 85 yuan. A silver shop traded 30 taels with each other, priced at 4,600 yuan. At that time, it once again pressed down to 4,585 yuan. At 10:50, it was heard that the foreign exchange central bank HSBC also had an appetite, so the black market exchange rate was tighter. Securities shops and others also had strong buying intentions, and it rose again by 25 yuan. The money exchange shop traded 20 taels with each other, priced at 4,610 yuan. Near noon, the foreign exchange turned flat, people's hearts were slightly frustrated, and buyers were watching, immediately returning within the 4,600 yuan mark. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to some gold shop, priced at 4,580 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, the trend was even stronger. The opening was 10 yuan higher. Some broker entered 20 taels for the money exchange shop, priced at 4,590 yuan. Later, a foreign bank came to entrust some bank to make an aggressive advance of more than 100 taels, causing the price to soar again by 50 yuan. Some bank entered 20 taels for the gold shop, priced at 4,640 yuan as the peak of the day. Later, because the foreign exchange was slightly harder, money exchange shops and silver shops all took advantage of the high price to sell, and the price plunged by 75 yuan. The money exchange shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop, priced at 4,565 yuan. The closing price last night resulted in an increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for four consecutive days, a total increase of 245 yuan. It was heard that it had risen again to 5,585 yuan after the close. The whole day fluctuated by 160 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the cooked red, and the current standard gold was 65 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few openings.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Results in a Draw</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry gold, per tael, initially Daxiang Bank still hung at 460 yuan. At 9:40, it was lowered by 5 yuan. More than 10 minutes later, it went back up by 5 yuan. At 3:40 pm, it was lowered again by 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, there were no ups and downs. Daxiang Bank still hung at the original price of 460 yuan, and Xinxing Bank was at 458 yuan. The closing was reduced by 20 yuan. In addition, the selling price of pure silver per tael at Daxiang Bank suddenly hung up by 3 jiao, estimated to be 3 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Remained Unchanged Yesterday</p>
<p>London, 16th The British pure gold remained at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 7 pence per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks were the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Discount Rises Again Opens at 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rate discount rate suddenly soared. In the morning, it gradually rose to 190 yuan per 1,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the demand for cash bills was still strong, rising again by 10 yuan, finally reaching the 200 yuan mark, 20 yuan higher than the previous day. The money industry association's borrowing interest rate remained unchanged, opening at 1 jiao 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate of British and American Gold Certificates Requires High Interest</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market experienced significant fluctuations due to the change in the exchange rate, ultimately resulting in closing prices similar to the previous day. Consequently, the British and American gold pounds initially strengthened but later weakened, resulting in an unstable outcome. However, the exchange rate of British and American gold certificates slightly softened, with high interest required. As a result, they rose significantly. Due to the demand from the industrial and commercial sectors to travel to the southwest, Hong Kong and French Indochina francs were in short supply, leading to firm market conditions. Singaporean certificates were slightly expensive due to travel needs. Japanese gold certificates were in high demand, rising considerably, reaching one yuan and eighteen fen in the evening market. Korean certificates were in scarce supply, also rising sharply, reaching ninety-nine fen in the evening market. Other currencies experienced stable market conditions due to insignificant supply and demand. Trading at the Exchange was sparse, with only Sen Tai selling 300 yuan of Hong Kong certificates to Xiang Kang. Yesterday's market prices showed British gold certificates rising by one yuan and five jiao, American gold certificates by three jiao, Hong Kong certificates by eight fen, French franc certificates by one fen, Singaporean certificates by one jiao and five fen, and French Indochina certificates by two jiao and five fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sudden Small Reversal of American Silver, British and Indian Silver Also Decline</h3>
<p>London, 16th - The silver market saw selling from India and speculative trading, leading to a generally weak market. After closing, there were some transactions at the listed price. Large bars of silver for both near and far terms retracted by 0.25. New York silver reported a sudden small retraction of 0.5 fen in spot prices. Bombay silver reported a weakening silver market, with spot and August prices both declining by eleven annas, and September declining by eighteen annas. Only fifty contracts were traded, it was reported.</p>
<h3>Food - Rice Prices Surge by Three Yuan - Using Shallow Reserves as Propaganda - Shaking the Hearts of Those in Apprehension</h3>
<p>The most cunning rice merchants are still employing media tactics, even using their reserves of just over 70,000 bags as propaganda to unsettle the people. In reality, this self-reported reserve number should not be treated as Shanghai's entire stockpile. Everyone knows it isn't. This newspaper has repeatedly exposed their deception. Even if the rice merchants' investigation is accurate, this mere 70,000+ bags of rice is only enough to feed Shanghai's five million residents for three days (according to their claim, this reserve level was valid up to August 14th). Is this really the case? Therefore, yesterday's evening newspapers unanimously criticized this behavior. However, rice merchants are heartlessly exploiting the news to drive up Shanghai rice prices by around three yuan, adding an extra burden on the people's staple food, which is exactly what is being called "toxic news" these days. No wonder rice merchants are singing its praises.</p>
<p>How much rice does Shanghai actually have in reserve? The best solution to this question is for the Public Works Department to investigate thoroughly. At this time, it's not just about price controls, but about paying attention to the entire rice market and conducting a systematic review, so that the rice merchants can no longer smirk and think they are untouchable. Only then will the people of the city be fortunate.</p>
<p>The shipment of Ke Xian rice to Shanghai has been in the works for a long time. A certain individual in the grain business is in charge, and a certain bank known for its economic cooperation is a partner. Therefore, when rice prices rise, the hoarders should certainly be held responsible, but the financial sector also indirectly and directly contributes to this. Those in the rice business have always regretted hoarding too little and making too little money. Their greed is truly lamentable. However, small rice shops are indeed facing difficulties, while large factories and corporations are making great fortunes.</p>
<p>Yesterday's under-the-table rice market was reportedly even more rampant, with prices being pushed up aggressively, completely disregarding local public order and the people's difficult situation. It was even said that premium high-grade glutinous rice (Gao Xi Geng) was at 32 yuan, market-grade at 31 yuan, and medium-grade at 30 yuan; Su Tong Kun glutinous rice at 31 yuan to 30 yuan; Changzhou fresh glutinous rice at 32 yuan; He Xia early and late rice at 28 yuan to 29 yuan; Pudong new glutinous rice (30 dan) at 29 yuan; premium Wu pointed rice at 27 yuan, ultimately at 26 yuan; ordinary pointed rice at 23.5 yuan to 24 yuan; and "change yuan" rice at 30 yuan. Total transaction volume was estimated to be no less than 13,000+ bags.</p>
<p>Ke Xian rice was in high demand yesterday, with internal and external hoarders and hawkers taking the opportunity to raise prices. Jing Wu Xian rice rose sharply, with prices reaching 28 yuan, a rise of 3 yuan compared to the previous market. The market chaos was unprecedented. Although the source has not been officially released, Japanese-Chinese merchants are working hard to transport it. In addition to a small number transported by trucks, it is rumored that Japanese ships such as the "Chikugo Maru" have loaded 6-7,000 bags, which were unloaded at warehouses in Hongkou.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, foreign New Saigon rice opened at 33.5 yuan, then rose by another two yuan to 35.5 yuan. However, it is rumored that a certain party has finalized an agreement to ship 10,000 tons to Shanghai for sale at a stable price, and 17,000 bags are being loaded within the next few days, with the intention of selling them at a flat rate once they arrive in port within this month. According to investigations by this newspaper, recently ships have been going directly to Saigon to load rice, but it is being transported to India for unloading.</p>
<h3>Flour Street Sales Surge - Wheat Supply Uninterrupted</h3>
<p>Flour remains at six yuan per original disc (yuanpan), because since rice prices soared, residents have switched to eating flour, leading to a significant increase in street sales. Factories are aware that customer-side transactions are quiet and are now focusing on their own street-side retail, rejecting customer side demand. Therefore, customer side continues to buy back factory flour and foreign flour from the market. It is heard that the resale price is still six yuan and one jiao. 4610 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the 18th.</p>
<p>Wheat - The supply is uninterrupted, and sentiment is not as feverish as in the previous two days. Hoarders and factory owners claim to be working together, but are now emphasizing caution. However, with rice prices skyrocketing and the Hong Kong situation becoming tense, the future of grain is still favorable, so those holding goods are maintaining their positions, resulting in continued price increases. The Tongshi (Unified Market) was jointly operated by Fuxin and Fufeng factories for Beijing-Zhenjiang-Suzhou-Changzhou wheat, totaling 16-17 truckloads. Hoarders brought in 20 truckloads, with the highest price at 9.1 yuan, a rise of a jiao or so from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes - Hoarders Are the Culprits - Oil Prices Rise Without End</h3>
<p>The oil market continues to move upwards, with the upward trend seeming endless. The general financial community and wealthy individuals are consistently adding more capital. Yesterday's peanut oil prices rose again by 2.5 yuan, and soybean oil prices increased by eight jiao to one yuan. 30 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at a price of 68.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Kobe raw oil at 67 yuan, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 39.6 yuan, 350 pieces of Yantai and Weihai soybean oil at 40.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingdao Weihai soybean oil at 40 yuan, 1000 cans of Tianjin canned soybean oil at 51.5 yuan and two jiao, 140 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 54.8 yuan to 54 yuan, and 250 barrels of both Kobe and Dalian oil at 55.8 yuan to 55.5 yuan. Also, 860 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Coarse and Refined White Sugar See New High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw little change according to London reports, with recent prices down 0.25 and longer-term prices up 0.25 to 0.75. Exchange trading, influenced by exchange rates, continued to rise sharply. Spot market #24 coarse white sugar, initially at 39.5 yuan at one warehouse, later reached 40 yuan. At other warehouses, it rose from 39 yuan to 40 yuan. Re-export goods were at 31 yuan to 32 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar rose by a total of two yuan. Western Warehouse B-mark opened at 43.8 yuan, and Eastern Warehouse at 6 jiao, later rising to 44.4 yuan, with some quoting as high as 45 yuan. Residual goods were withdrawn. Local refined white sugar rose by two yuan. Zhenji #1 was at 40 yuan, and local #1 rock sugar also rose by two yuan to 44 yuan. Jingming rock sugar was at 46 yuan. Domestic sugar remained firm. Chaozhou's formal Huanggang Qing opened to 33.3 yuan, with over a hundred bags traded.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Landings at Shenzhen - Yarn Sales Suddenly Hit - Prices Rise Then Fall</h3>
<p>The yarn market has begun to weaken after a period of sustained firmness, showing a wavering trend. In reality, actual sales are lacking. The Japanese army suddenly invaded Shenzhen in Southern China, creating a tense atmosphere on the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, which has further hit yarn sales. Today, Hong Kong dealers purchased only 110 bales, and other dealers also remained inactive. The market situation is very peaceful, with a narrow range of price fluctuations. However, some who expect prices to rise still refuse to give up, arguing that raw materials are expensive and factory costs have increased. However, prices have already reached a high level, and future changes are inevitable.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened with nervous sentiment, and buyers continued to crowd in, with opening prices rising by five to six yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that exchange rates had weakened and gold had risen again, further fueling the buying frenzy and causing the market to rise by a few more yuan. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign warehouses has reached 760 yuan. However, as the Hong Kong dealers' buying intentions weakened, the situation reversed, and prices fell back by seven to eight yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn is 751 yuan. Factory list prices fell from 693 yuan to 687 yuan. The closing price was flat. It is estimated that the total transaction volume from all parties during the first half of the day was 630 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse spot yarn rose by two yuan, and Shepherd also rose by two yuan. Factory prices remained unchanged. 22 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai today. The amount of purchases by each dealer group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 345; Mainland: 110;</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 110; Yunnan: 50;</p>
<p>Xiamen: 15; Total: 630.</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of Yarn Sales</h3>
<p>In recent days, the sales of 20-count Double Horse and Tejin Cheng brand cotton yarn have been particularly strong, and the selling prices have been particularly high. The reasons for this are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Hong Kong dealers are buying as much of this yarn as possible because the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in Shanghai is unusually high. They can still make a profit by selling and transporting the goods to Southeast Asia. This is how the yarn has developed.</p>
<p>(2) The yarns produced by Shenxin Textile Mill are the same. The price of Double Horse yarn from the No. 9 mill is high and cannot meet the demand. The price of Flying Maiden yarn from the No. 2 mill is low and there is no way to sell it. This yarn is sold exclusively in Fujian and Zhejiang. Since Chaoshan was lost, sales have been interrupted, and the market price has fallen, making the price of Double Horse yarn much higher, falling short by 60 or 70 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) The mainland's management is strict. 1100 yuan in Sichuan is worth 1000 yuan in Shanghai, which is equal to a 17% discount. According to a survey, the market price of 20-count fine yarn in Sichuan is only 1200-1300 yuan. Each bale of cotton yarn costs 200 yuan to transport to Chongqing, including water taxes, customs duties, insurance, and transportation costs. The current selling price of 20-count fine yarn in Shanghai is 750 yuan. Based on the above situation, yarns transported to the hinterland will not only fail to make a profit, but will also suffer losses.</p>
<h3>Concerns About Changes in Customs Gold Exchange Rate - Cotton Merchants Reluctant to Sell Cheaply</h3>
<p>Spot trading of both Chinese and foreign cotton has disappeared because prices are already too high. Factories are in no hurry to buy. As for new factories, the price of yarn is more than 100 yuan cheaper than the price of yarn from older factories. At the current price of spot cotton, they are already losing money and have no need for raw cotton. The light trading volume is the biggest factor. It is said that 396 bales of Tonghua arrived from northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Another report states that the exchange rate in Shanghai's foreign cotton market tightened again yesterday. The statutory currency price per dan was increased by six to seven yuan. There are also rumors in the market that the customs gold exchange rate will be changed starting next month. Because of this, various colleagues deeply fear that the tax on future arrivals may increase by several times more than 5.75 yuan, so they are temporarily unwilling to sell. Factories' willingness to purchase has slightly changed, not as relaxed as before, so spot trading has been very brisk in recent days.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, has been sluggish in recent days. Yesterday, due to hedging sales in the south and sales in New Orleans, the market price was depressed throughout the day. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai also reported declines, arousing speculators in the market. As a result, the closing price fell by six to seven pounds compared to the previous day. Indian futures fell by more than one rupee, and Egyptian futures rose by more than ten pounds.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Hong Kong and Guangdong Cloth Sales Active - Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot sales to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia dealers were very strong, and the market became firmer. There was strong sales volume of light-colored goods such as bleached cloth, bleached twill, floral cloth, hemp yarn, and foreign-spun cloth; and dark-colored goods such as blue cloth, colored twill, line flannel, serge, satin damask, and feather silk. Each piece rose frequently by one jiao to five jiao. Fine twill and coarse twill rose by one to two jiao. Fine cloth was flat. However, Ewo's 13-pound and 11-pound coarse cloth was slow-moving, and hoarders sold, with each piece falling by one to two jiao. Other grades remained stable. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers purchased over 300 pieces of dark-colored goods and fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan dealers purchased over 100 pieces. Siamese and Singaporean dealers mostly purchased light-colored cloth, totaling over 4,000 pieces. Ningbo dealers purchased over 50 pieces of coarse cloth serge and colored twill. Local dyeing factories had large demand and traded over 300 pieces of dyed fine twill, satin blank cloth, and velvet blank cloth. Wholesale stores bought small amounts, and retail business was also weak.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill tightened due to buying by northern dealers. Each piece rose by 1.5 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Dealers from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao purchased over 700 pieces in total. Over 300 pieces were traded in this street. The spot price of Longtou fine cloth is 18.9 yuan, the futures price is 19.25 yuan, and the price for next month is 19.5 yuan. Japanese firms opened over 300 pieces of fine cloth, and it is heard that the price of Longtou for September is 19.5 yuan, and the spot price of Taizuru is 17.5 yuan. Serge, called "Gentleman Cloth," was also more expensive, and yesterday each yard also rose to 0.5425 yuan. 30 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Securities - Domestic Debt Already Reaching Its Limits - Foreign Stocks Seem to Rise</h3>
<p>The securities market remained sluggish yesterday, and trading became increasingly quiet. Both buyers and sellers were suspicious. The multi-party side was unwilling to add capital due to too many rumors, and the short side was also afraid to be bold because of the ever-changing manipulators on the floor. Slightly selling would lead to a decline, and the floor was only slightly hedging. United Union, United Benefit, and Zhen Kang sold, and only Hong Kang had some appetite for buying. Retail transactions were extremely rare. In short, public debt trading has reached its limits since the drastic changes in exchange rates and is no longer a concern for the financial community and large investors. Therefore, there is little hope at present. Yesterday's results fell by three jiao to one yuan. The total transaction volume was just over 200,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Chinese Electric Company were traded at a price of 5.45 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market of the General Chamber of Commerce was depressed due to news from Europe and politics. Prices fell at the opening, but soon sentiment improved, confidence gradually increased, and trading progressed rapidly. In the afternoon, as the new trading week began, prices rose further. Huideli shares were unusually active, with the price rising from 32.5 yuan at the opening to a peak of 36 yuan, because the public expects that the announcement of the final dividend for the previous period will be very good. Later, there was a slight pullback, stopping at 35 yuan. The good dividends announced by several rubber companies recently are tantamount to a prelude to the progress of each company's situation. Judging from the current upward trend of the Singapore dollar (one Singapore dollar is worth eight Chinese yuan), the distribution of dividends from each rubber company will be placed on a much larger foundation than before in the future. The public debt market continued to decline, and the transaction price of the electric power public debt was 73 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commercial information column of this newspaper has been particularly detailed, which has long been noticed by readers. Recently, due to space constraints, not only have daily news reports been cut, but also reports on market conditions in the commercial information section that have not changed or have changed very little have been omitted, except when they are involved in the news. Also, such as the New York stock market, the report has been omitted due to necessity, except for the market price. When the space is expanded in the future, it will naturally be restored to its original state and enriched to meet the expectations of readers.</p>
<p>The Rubber Limited Company, managed by Huayitong Foreign Firm in this port, yesterday decided at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 5 jiao per share in national currency from August 30th for the year 1939. The Zhongxing Coal Mine Co., Ltd. in this port has been paying the 27th-year dividend from the 15th of this month at an annual rate of 3%.</p>
<p>London English Far East Companies' shares on 16th of this month (Wednesday) Listed Market Price: Shanghai Tramways share decreased by two shillings and six pence, price being twelve shillings and six pence, Kurak Lin Bang Rubber share decreased by 0.75 pence, price remains eighteen shillings and 0.75 pence, nothing else changed.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debts on 16th of this month (Wednesday) Listed Market Price: Stable again, all debts unchanged.</p>
<h3>Seafood - Hong Kong and Little Luzon - Strong Purchases of Golden Mountain Shrimp Tails</h3>
<p>The previous market for Jinshan shrimp tails was sluggish, and although the exchange rate frequently contracted and expanded, the price increase was still flat. But recently, Hong Kong and Luzon have made major purchases, so it is now priced at 270 yuan, a sudden increase of 30 yuan. Over ten items of domestic products recently arrived at Yangjiao Gouwei, and were opened for sale yesterday at 179 yuan (exchange transfer).</p>
<h3>Market Summary</h3>
<p>This lake lotus continued to be expensive. The supply of lotus seeds in the open lotus market is lacking, so this lake lotus has risen to 170 yuan, Raozhou lotus to 150 yuan, up another two or three yuan from before.</p>
<p>Sichuan fungus rises 30 yuan. Black fungus is highly priced due to high arrival cost, and it continues to rise. Yesterday it was heard that Sichuan fungus has opened to 325 yuan, a further increase of more than 30 yuan. The market price of Gao Zhuang brand postal fungus is 335 yuan, with a final price of 325 yuan, and the price of original package Sichuan fungus is 330 yuan.</p>
<p>New cicada slough have not arrived. New cicada slough typically arrive in mid-summer, but this year, they have not been shipped to Shanghai yet. This product is mostly produced in northern Jiangsu, and the goods in the occupied areas are mostly controlled by others, so they cannot be transported out. The products currently being sold in the market are all old goods, such as 60 yuan for clean cicada slough.</p>
<p>Indian coal涨风止息. Although Indian bituminous coal has risen onefold in price, the sales are actually frozen. Furthermore, there is new cargo arriving. These cargoes have had their prices pre-determined in shillings, and they have a relatively light cost. Because of this, the price上涨 trend has temporarily ceased. Colleagues have already taken off 5 yuan from the initial拆价 of 80 yuan per ton. Delivery from godowns in the Settlement requires additional transportation fee. Retail at shop front costs 1.05 yuan per basket.</p>

<h3>Should Husbands also Court Their Wives?</h3>
<p>A husband who is a lustful beast cannot enjoy true happiness in life, even with his own wife. It is generally believed that before marriage, a man, in order to achieve his goal, can make any grand promise in front of her, can flatter his lover in every possible way, and seem to be sincere and pious. However, once they climb into the same bed, achieve marital bliss, and confirm their status as husband and wife, then the wife must sincerely and piously court her husband. To say that the husband must constantly court his wife would easily cause laughter. In fact, the relationship between husband and wife should not be determined by one act of love and winning her favor, but rather, every time before husband and wife engage in marital bliss, the husband should court her.</p>
<p>Animals are not as foolish as humans. Every time a beast mates with a female, it must first engage in a species-specific form of courtship, such as attacking other males to show his strength and stimulate her, or vibrating beautiful feathers and warbling songs to arouse her. We must never forget that every act of marital bliss between husband and wife is equal to a wedding. The husband's courtship is indispensable. Because when a woman is physiologically prepared, it is not only for the sake of avoiding her pain, but also for the benefit of the man. It not only increases emotional pleasure, but also has great benefits for the health of both husband and wife!</p>
<p>However, if a husband wants to achieve this goal, he must have healthy sexual function, so that he can self-control and also stimulate his wife to reach a state of harmony and pleasure. Therefore, affectionate love forms a happy family and gives birth to clever children. This is so meaningful and happy! However, if a man has committed self-pollution or nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been dissolute and indulged in lust after marriage, and has consumed too much of the reproductive gland fluid that controls sexual health, then kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, and infertility will be endless. Such a husband, not to mention that he cannot automatically court his wife, I am afraid that when his wife really courts him, it will be difficult to cope with, so he cannot enjoy the favor of a beautiful woman. This is not only boring for the husband himself, but how can the wife not be heartbroken? From this, tragedies such as elopement, suicide, separation, and divorce in the family are innumerable! However, the above-mentioned symptoms are not incurable. Since the success of reproductive gland supplementation therapy, there is no need to worry! If patients can actively take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductin," they can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, and nourish the nerves on the first day and night after taking it. Regular taking can also help development and adjust metabolism. Not only can it cure various diseases in a short period of time, but it can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and reversing aging. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemitol's Semen Consolidating Tablets" to stop emission and achieve rapid results!</p>
<p>Patient Zhao Qianli, a native of Zhejiang, is 30 years old. He has been infertile for five years after marriage and has symptoms such as premature ejaculation and impotence, and occasionally has nocturnal emission. He consulted me last month, so I asked him to purchase "Reproductin" and "Hemitol's Semen Consolidating Tablets" from Yong'an Pharmacy and take them together. As a result, after continuous use for a month, he has now recovered his complete health.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Nocturnal Emission in Early Autumn - Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</h3>
<p>Although it is already autumn, the summer heat has not dissipated. As the saying goes, "Heatstroke! Heatstroke!" The summer heat is not good for the brain. A person suffering from brain weakness due to nocturnal emission will definitely have poor memory, drowsy thoughts, and often have insomnia and swelling pain... His pain is difficult for others to understand! Why do people suffering from nocturnal emission suffer from brain weakness? Because the chemical components in our semen are mostly phosphorus and calcium, which are the main raw materials for the brain, kidneys, and nerves. Moreover, semen is physiologically what is called reproductive gland fluid, in which the pituitary gland comes directly from the brain, so those with nocturnal emission that leads to semen depletion will suffer from brain weakness, kidney deficiency, neurasthenia, etc. Brain weakness is most difficult to bear in hot weather, and kidney deficiency is most painful after the weather cools!</p>
<p>Why is there nocturnal emission? In addition to physiological spermatic overflow, it is mostly caused by self-abuse during the onset of spring, or early marriage and excessive sorrow, which injures the sexual nerves. Therefore, the seminal gates cannot be tightly controlled. Initially, emission is occasionally caused by dream stimulation, then every dream leads to emission, or emission occurs without dreams, or even during the day. At that time, the seminal gates have almost completely lost control. Under such circumstances, how can the semen not be depleted, so symptoms such as brain weakness and kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, and scattered energy will follow one after another. Not only will it hinder the future of young people, but it will also lose the happiness that life should enjoy!</p>
<p>Treatment of nocturnal emission in early autumn is actually a better time. At this time, the weather is not too hot. You can pay attention to exercise, frequently wash the local area with cold water, read fewer erotic books and paintings, which is very helpful for purifying the mind and reducing desires, and abstain from self-abuse. At the same time, take "Hemitol's Semen Consolidating Tablets," a special medicine for treating emission that is praised by famous doctors at home and abroad. This will consolidate the seminal gates and can achieve the miraculous effect of promoting sleep and stopping emission that night. If there are already symptoms of brain weakness and kidney deficiency, you must also take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and promote development. Continuous use will definitely cure various diseases in a short period of time. If you can come to this clinic for electrotherapy injections at the same time, we can guarantee a cure.</p>

<h3>Don't Let Withered Breasts Lead to a Tragic Situation!</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor and Chong Pei</p>
<p>Actively Salvage the Sea of Regret</p>
<p>Whatever it is, if everyone is ignorant of it, doesn't pay attention to it, doesn't compare it, then it's just ordinary and unremarkable, and you can't tell what's good or bad, superior or inferior. But once it's revealed and carefully compared, then not only is the good and bad clearly distinguished, the superior and inferior are immediately judged, but also the good seems even better, and the inferior is even worse.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the development of a woman's breasts as an example. Before we doctors loudly proclaimed it, everyone didn't pay much attention to it. Because they didn't pay much attention to it, many women with withered breasts were not considered hateful by society. But later, we elaborated on the various advantages and disadvantages of withered breasts in various medical publications, and scholars advocated for it in their writings. As a result, men's aesthetic views on women have greatly changed. Now, not only do modern men openly take tall breasts and a healthy physique as the standard for choosing a wife, but also women with more progressive ideas are working hard to develop their breasts as their only important task! Indeed, no one in life doesn't hope for happiness. If they are once invaded by disease, or have irregular menstruation, malnutrition, severe illness, or excessive sorrow, leading to withered breasts and loss of beauty, then not only will they be unable to attract attention and cause knowing smiles in social situations, but they will also fear that they will encounter setbacks in choosing a husband or that marital discord will lead to various incidents, falling into a tragic situation in life, which is a lifelong regret! If you want to remedy it, you can only actively take the female "Reproductive Element," a preparation of gonadal ovarian endocrine, which is most effective for this symptom. The reason is that this agent was invented by Austrian medical saint Dr. Staner after more than 30 years of arduous practical experimentation. Therefore, the medicine is the most gentle and the effect is the greatest. It can be taken regularly in both severe winter and hot summer. If you continue to take it for a season, it can not only make withered breasts become plump and tall, make your cheeks rosy, and enhance your health and beauty, but also produce a large number of new cells in your body, enhance your natural resistance, prevent all diseases, and always maintain health and well-being.</p>

<h3>Gonorrheal Prostatitis</h3>
<p>The prostate gland is located in a crucial part of the internal reproductive organs. Some people with gonorrhea do not develop cystitis or orchitis, but no one does not develop prostatitis. The only reproductive function of the prostate gland is to secrete a kind of prostatic fluid. This fluid must flow out with the semen during sexual intercourse, and is an essential element for nourishing sperm. Without sperm, one cannot reproduce, but having sperm without prostatic fluid also makes one unable to reproduce. This is because sperm cannot survive without prostatic fluid.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that gonorrheal prostatitis is the most easily encountered complication of gonorrhea, and it is also the symptom that most easily hinders fertility. Therefore, if gonorrhea patients develop prostatitis, they must prevent the destruction of reproductive function and quickly undergo effective treatment to avoid adverse prognoses.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of prostatitis, with new scientific discoveries, the purely local therapies of the past have been abandoned. The purely old local therapies – local surgical therapies – were nothing more than monotonous prostate massages, but it was not known that prostate massages absolutely cannot eliminate all the gonococci hidden in the glands. Therefore, local surgical massage alone has never cured prostatitis. I use the latest German Fulllimpe Electric Therapy, which is inserted directly into the part of the anus adjacent to the prostate gland, and the degree of electricity is applied according to the severity of the condition, supplemented by chemical therapy, which can be cured in a short period of time and can guarantee fertility.</p>

<h3>How I Directed "Sinking Abyss"</h3>
<p>— (Wu Jiangfan)</p>
<p>If "Thunderstorm" introduced realist drama to the Chinese stage, then "Sinking Abyss" will be the first drama to introduce romanticism to the Chinese stage. Saying this may be too general and too narrow. (Because the connotation of "Sinking Abyss" has traces of various Western drama schools.) However, "realistic" and "romantic" are not absolutely opposed to each other. The question is whether there is "authenticity" in the work. Naturally, using this romantic method to write about the current Chinese era will definitely achieve greater results. Gorky said that realism and revolutionary romanticism complement each other, which is exactly what he meant.</p>
<p>The true value of the "Sinking Abyss" script is to be determined by critics, but as a performer, I feel that the collapse of the old society and the old system is depicted quite deeply in this script. Perhaps the twists and turns of the story make people think of "karma" and "destiny," but the concept of depicting the bright side is an even bigger reason. Therefore, in the performance, the fulfillment of the latter is particularly emphasized.</p>
<p>I believe that a director is not just an annotator of the script: reading the author's script word for word on the stage and introducing it to the audience. He should work hard to strengthen the script and actively develop the "intention" in the play. For this reason, I hope the audience will not only pity the characters in the play, but should see further. This is precisely where it is not easy to succeed.</p>
<p>I know that some people pay special attention to each interesting scene, interesting action, or deliberately create some stage images for the sake of formal beauty in the performance of the drama. (Even if it is inconsistent with the entire play) I don't want to try these things in "Sinking Abyss." At the same time, I never restrict the actors from doing certain actions during rehearsals (but constantly remind them of the actions that start from the psychology). I focus on the psychological disguise and changes, so that the actors are completely immersed in the role. Use explanations and repeated storytelling to make them do it. Stanislavski established the "psychological realism" of acting. In the past, "amateurs" also put forward the same slogan. This is correct. It is a pity that we have completed too little and we are still a long way from the word "ism" and need to work hard. But I dare to believe that "psychological acting" is the first step we have taken on the right path of acting. From psychology to physiology, dilute the accidental and side emphases: the inevitable and the main ones. This is the method of realism, and it is the same in literature and art, and in acting.</p>
<p>In "Sinking Abyss," I especially emphasize this kind of acting, and add the changes and complexity of status; and the compactness and transformation of the scene, using this close speed and rhythm.</p>
<p>For the romantic tendency of this play, a little bit of old performance methods are also adopted in the performance. I often put the heavier scenes in the center of the stage, but of course I take reality into account.</p>
<p>Realistic acting is of course the reproduction of human behavior. Therefore, the fourth wall (not applicable to theaters without a fourth wall or other types of acting), I want the actors to cross the curtain line as if they are deliberately talking to the audience. (Because the stage is small, this may not be fully achieved) When acting, you don't have to worry about your back facing the audience (of course, most of the time you still have to face the audience), turning to score left and right and other preliminary acting methods. In a few places, I also specifically used the acting of the actors' backs to obtain a stronger and more realistic effect. There is even a place—when Cai Wen (played by Xia Xia) confessed her love to Si Yuan (Xu Li), I deliberately told Cai Wen to circle around him with her back to the audience.</p>
<p>On the one hand, acting must abandon reflexive actions, and at the same time avoid physiological stimulation. Acting is like singing. There are many high steps from Do (assumed to be happy) to Ti (assumed to be sad), and Ti and high-pitched Do are only a hair's breadth apart. This is the difficulty.</p>
<p>Tairov said: Acting must be like orchestrating, and the art of the actor is only a part of it. In "Sinking Abyss," I divide the actors' performances into two types, one I call "counterpoint" and the other I call "harmonic." The former is (in a certain scene) to make the secondary performers perform in a contrasting way, whether in facial expressions, movements, postures, and positions. The latter is that the secondary performers perform in a harmonious and supporting way.</p>
<p>In terms of scenery, props, effects, and lighting, we also try our best to make them help the performance create an atmosphere. Being a director is originally difficult. Although I disagree with Gordon Craig's theory that the director must be a master of all arts, I know that the director must understand various arts. As such a shallow person as I am, I know that it is an attempt. If there is any success, it is due to the efforts of the actors and technical workers. As for myself, I still have to get the guidance of every audience member.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama and Art Society is a historical theater troupe. This time I am the director, and I really feel extremely apprehensive. And when I meet such a large audience, I really have nothing else to say. I would like to offer my respects and bows before the footlights:</p>
<p>"Please criticize without hesitation."</p>
<h3>Gospel for the Unschooled</h3>
<p>— Chang Shui</p>
<p>Education in Shanghai seems to be very developed and very popular. Isn't it: The number of school enrollment advertisements in newspapers and the schools that are everywhere can be imagined. But if we open our eyes wide to take a look, we will know that there are still many unschooled people who have no opportunity to study.</p>
<p>Most of these unschooled people are apprentices, workers, and the vast majority of the working people. They could not step into the "school" at the beginning, and when they enter society, they have to use their labor to earn a living; but they do not dislike reading, and they also know that reading can understand the truth of being a person and the convenience of dealing with things. Then let's have tutoring: Although tutoring schools are quite developed in Shanghai, they are too high in degree, and those who are illiterate have no way to start reading; and the tuition is also very expensive, which cannot be afforded by workers and apprentices, so they are forever rejected outside the door of the school!</p>
<p>Now, these unfortunate people have gradually been noticed. As far as the author knows, following the Hudong Commune Apprentice Night School, the Alumni Association of the Fourth Zhonghua Vocational Tutoring School is also starting to run the Zhonghua Worker's Voluntary Night School. All the methods are the same as the Hudong Commune Voluntary School (completely free). The valuable thing is that the people in charge of the voluntary school are purely students who are the main body, and the teachers are also enthusiastic and excellent students. It is said that the registrants are very enthusiastic, exceeding the quota, and have already started school at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>Here, in addition to being happy for a part of the unfortunate people—unschooled compatriots, I also hope that enthusiastic educators can respond and run a few more such voluntary tutoring schools.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Depositors of Jiangsu Bank</h3>
<p>— Xue Haoran Shang (August 14th)</p>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Bank started paying deposits to depositors in the guerrilla areas at the end of last year, the methods it has set are extremely harsh, and depositors everywhere are complaining. According to the stable financial measures promulgated by the Ministry in August of the 26th year, 5% is withdrawn every week. Assuming that the deposit is 1,000 yuan, 90 yuan is allowed to be withdrawn. Although the deposit is reduced later, 50 yuan is used as the standard for each payment, and the payment is not reduced because the deposit is reduced. (Transportation and other banks are doing the same) However, the bank does not follow this method, and immediately checks according to the remaining balance of the deposit. For example, if the deposit is 1,000 yuan, 50 yuan will be paid for the first time, and 47 yuan will be paid for the next time according to 5% of the remaining 950 yuan. (And so on) Therefore, the smaller the deposit, the smaller the payment. Also, according to the Ministry's rules, if the deposit is only 300 yuan, it is allowed to be withdrawn at one time. The bank does not follow this rule and must still pay according to 5%. Not to mention that depositors in other places feel that the frequent trips are too heavy and the losses are too heavy, even those who live in Shanghai are suffering from running around often, which is unbearable. Also, the bank's daily payment time is from 9:00 am to 11:00 am. After the time limit, there is no flexibility. In this extremely short period of time, all depositors in the Beijing-Shanghai Road area who take a car to Shanghai will not be able to catch up on the same day and will have to stay in a hotel, spending more money. I originally deposited more than 900 yuan of national currency in Wuxi Jiangsu Bank. At the beginning of the payment at the end of October last year, I came to Shanghai from Wuxi and stayed in a hotel. I went to withdraw it once a week. I did this for more than two months. Later, because the travel expenses were too high, the money withdrawn was only enough for meals and accommodation. It was called withdrawing deposits, but in reality, it was equivalent to nothing. I discussed with the bank staff whether there was a way to change it. They said that it was possible to withdraw it once every few weeks. Hearing this, I was very happy. I packed my bags and returned to Wuxi, delayed for two months, and brought the passbook to Shanghai, thinking that I could withdraw the money for eight weeks. When I arrived at the bank's payment office, I learned that the bank clerk suddenly said that the maximum was four weeks and no more could be paid. Although I repeatedly asked him for help, it was ultimately ineffective. From then on, I followed the instructions and came to Shanghai once a month. Now it is estimated that there are still more than 140 yuan left in the spring. Today is the payment date, and a total of 25 yuan has been withdrawn. After deducting the round-trip travel expenses, there are only 11 yuan and a few cents left. Now, if we calculate the total, half of the original deposit of more than 900 yuan has been spent on round-trip travel expenses. If it is possible to withdraw it once every two or three months, and those with a balance of less than 300 yuan are allowed to withdraw it at one time, the loss would not be so great. I think that among the depositors, there must be many who share this appeal regarding the bank's dissatisfaction. I am specially explaining it in detail and respectfully request that your honorable publication not hesitate to give a corner of land and grant it to be published, hoping that the bank authorities will consider the difficulties of the refugees and handle it in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Then the small number of depositors will benefit a lot. This is to the Editor, Tai Cha</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen Overseas Beautiful News Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves Miracle in the Fire Turns into Lotus Flower</p>
<p>But it is strange to say that among the many students who pursued Alice, Alice had a special affection for a Chinese student named Cheng Gong. There are several reasons for this: First, Alice and Cheng Gong were in the same class, and they went to the lecture hall together every day; second, Cheng Gong's residence was very close to Alice's, and they often met on the road when they went to and from school, and they gradually became close as they talked along the way. And another reason is that the white people in the class often look down on Chinese people. This kind of racial prejudice often lies in the hearts of white youths. Especially in that Lyon University, there are many children from aristocratic families, that is, there are really many foreign playboys. They thought that Alice was a delicate French lady, how could she associate with a yellow person. They also saw them coming to school together every morning. Alice had a bicycle, and she rode her bicycle to school every day. Cheng Gong also had a bicycle, and when the two met on the road, they either rode side by side or chased each other. When they arrived at school, Alice handed her car over to Cheng Gong, and she didn't care about anything else. After school, the two sometimes took a circle in the park, or they leaned their two cars against a tree under a flower, and they sat side by side and talked. This situation inevitably aroused jealousy in the eyes of other students. They thought that Alice was fond of this Chinese youth, and couldn't so many of our handsome young men be as good as a yellow race? They couldn't help but satirize and ridicule Alice in their words. And in fact, Alice didn't have a particularly passionate love for Cheng Gong. French girls have always been lively and free, and their manners are generous. She looked at Cheng Gong, although he was a Chinese boy, his character was not bad. And he was also handsome and burly, unlike the dwarves of other Eastern countries, whose appearance was ugly, and it was annoying to see people bowing and bowing. Moreover, although the two became closer day by day, Cheng Gong never asked Alice to love him, so Alice also respected him very much. Now, because other students have satirical words to her, Alice is greatly unhappy in her heart. She said: Even in heterosexual interactions, everyone has their own reasons, and parents cannot force their children to do anything. Not to mention that Cheng Gong is a Chinese youth and a yellow race. Even if he is an Abyssinian, a black race, I want to like him, and I will like him. How can others interfere? At this time, Miss Alice couldn't help but feel resentful towards those students. Not only did she not stop interacting with Cheng Gong, but she deliberately became intimate with Cheng Gong.

<p>Random Notes on Artists</p>
<h3>From Stage to Screen (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Yindi</p>
<p>— Narrated by Ms. Yuan Meiyun —</p>
<p>(Editor's Introduction) Ms. Yuan Meiyun is good at performing tragedies and is one of the most talented people in the Chinese film industry. Before entering the film industry, she was a small actress with more experience in theatrical art. What is published today is the process of Ms. Yuan's performance of Peking opera, and tomorrow will begin to record her life in the film industry.</p>
<p>Since I was ten years old, I have been engaged in stage life. My plays were taught by "Two Immortals", one is Li Qinxian and the other is Yu Lianxian. Mr. Gu Muqi, a famous chestnut friend, also enthusiastically taught me several plays.</p>
<p>Most people imagine that learning to act is very hard, which may be the fact, but I was very lucky. During my learning period, I was never beaten or even heard a scolding sound. I have been interested in singing since I was a child, which may be a main reason. In the red carpet art, it is inevitable to go to the pier. In other places, I have been to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, and Hangzhou has been the place where I have performed for the longest time. In addition, I have not been to farther places. As for Shanghai, there are many places where I have teamed up. In the Dan Gui First Stage, I was in the same class as Chang Chunheng and Liu Xiaoheng, performing in "The Creation of the World"; in the Gengxin Stage, I was in the same class as Wang Huchen, performing the color scene play "The First Bridge in the World"; in the Tianchan Stage, I was in the same class as Qilin Tong, Xiao Yang Yuelou, and Chen Hefeng. At that time, Da Chan performed the local opera "Three Hundred Years of the Qing Dynasty".</p>
<p>Yuan Hanyun, my junior sister, was the first to cooperate with me. She sang Laosheng. She and I were paired in performances in other places. At this time, we were still child actors, and everyone called us a pair of small actresses, but later Hanyun separated from me.</p>
<p>My entry into the film industry was entirely a chance, and it was beyond my expectation. Who knew that this chance would make me abandon my inherent ability and change to become a film worker, changing from a "singing career" to a "filming" career. Here, I have to mention Mr. Shao Zuiweng.</p>

<h3>The Process of Adapting "Ideal Wife" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Sun Zhang</p>
<p>In short; Mo's profound observation of human beings and the thoroughness of the play's arrangement have made me feel greatly honored to be able to adapt and perform it. What I have tried my best to do is to fully retain the spirit of the original author, his special style, and his lively and sharp writing style, and to make him wear Chinese clothes, so that the audience deeply believes that this story happened in China and is a Chinese play.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people do not approve of translating scripts, and no matter how they are adapted, they cannot get rid of the foreign flavor. That's right; staging original scripts is a more important task at present, and the effect of their performance is indeed above that of translations. However; before our spoken drama has a long history and effectiveness, we need to search for and learn something more mature from the plays of other countries.</p>
<p>What we need to consider is the value of the script itself, whether it is related to our social habits and customs, and what the social response and its effect will be after the performance? Although we dare not have too high expectations, we cannot make it without any gain!</p>
<p>Looking at the whole play, "L'Ecole Des Femmes" seems to be most appropriately named "Ideal Wife", so I boldly changed the name to this.</p>
<p>Now; the "China-France Drama Society" is in line with the main purpose of communicating the "Chinese" and "French" art and culture, and after "The Wilderness", it staged "Ideal Wife". Therefore, I was able to discuss it with Mr. Shu Yin, the director of this play, several times, and I am grateful to Mr. Shu Yin for giving me many valuable opinions, which made "Ideal Wife" more colorful!</p>
<p>Finally! The play "L'Ecole Des Femmes" can be regarded as a social drama, a customs drama, a marriage drama, or a family drama. Whether it is satire, problem, or exposure, in short; a play can exist for a reason! With the enthusiasm of loving drama, I pay tribute to the original author, Molière!</p>
<p>The above is a draft hastily written for the special issue of "Ideal Wife" for the "China-France" public performance. Yesterday, I saw the announcement in the Shen and Xin newspapers that Mr. Tian Shujun had resigned from the position of supervisor of the "China-France Drama Society". This morning, I received a letter from Mr. Shu Yin, which made me roughly understand the reasons for the unfortunate incident that occurred in "China-France" this time. At the same time, the staging of "Ideal Wife" after "The Wilderness" has also become a pipe dream. All the efforts of the actors and directors who have been rehearsing in the heat of more than 80 degrees for ten days have been in vain.</p>
<p>Under the enthusiasm of loving the "isolated island" drama movement, I feel great sorrow for the misfortune suffered by "China-France". I hope that "China-France" can meet us again with a new attitude in the shortest possible time under close understanding and close cooperation. I sincerely wish!</p>
<p>News from bookstores indicates that "Ideal Wife" will be published today. In the current shortage of so-called scripts, I am ashamed to bring this tentative work to the readers, and I hope that the smart readers and seniors in the drama industry will give me serious guidance!</p>
<h3>Foreign Films Will Not Disappear from Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xiaochun</p>
<p>— The Remedy is a General Price Increase</p>
<p>The article "Foreign Films Will Not Be Shown in Shanghai" was published in this issue on the 10th. The reasons stated are indeed true. Due to the tight foreign exchange and the low price of the legal currency, foreign films in Shanghai are not profitable. Even second-rate films sometimes have difficulty selling even the cost of "copies". Therefore, there is a proposal to stop shipping foreign films to Shanghai for screening. But in fact, foreign film dealers will not immediately give up the Shanghai market. They have now properly negotiated a remedy with various cinemas, which is a general price increase. On the cinema side, daily expenses such as electricity, carbon electrodes, and coal have also increased, so they also quite agree to slightly increase the ticket price. It is reported that the ticket price for first-run cinemas will increase to start from one yuan, the second-run will start from forty-five cents, and the third-run will start from twenty-three cents. This move will be implemented from the first day of next month (September). Therefore, movie fans at sea do not need to worry too much. As for the film copies used for domestic films, they all rely on foreign countries, and the cost has also increased. Whether the cinemas that screen domestic films will increase prices at the same time has not been decided yet.</p>
<h3>Charity Dance Competition Prelude</h3>
<p>— Being Prepared</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's charity tea dance competition, sponsored by the association, has been suspended for quite some time. Now, after discussions between Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and various dance hall managers, it has been decided to change it to a partner dance competition, and all the dance stars in the city's dance halls will be mobilized to participate in the competition. The association will send personnel to the venues to sell charity "lucky fruit" tickets, each priced at one yuan, which can be used as dance fees. The dance stars participating in the partner dance will have their performance judged based on the number of lucky fruit tickets they receive. The competition will be divided into preliminary and final rounds. The preliminary round will be held individually at each dance hall, with all the dance stars in the hall participating. The top ten stars with the most votes will be named the "Top Ten Stars" of that dance hall. After each dance hall selects its Top Ten Stars, a suitable location will be rented for the final round, which will last for three days. The top ten stars with the most votes will be named the "Top Ten Stars of Shanghai's Dance World." The results of both the preliminary and final rounds will be published in newspapers to provide encouragement. If any dance hall wishes to arrange a performance program during the preliminary round, they should consult with the association beforehand for assistance. In addition to various trophies, prizes, and certificates of appreciation, the association will also solicit silver ding (ancient cooking vessel) and silver cups and other souvenirs from enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life, to be awarded to the enthusiastic dance stars who participate in the competition. At the end of the competition, a grand award ceremony will be held to commend benevolent spirit.</p>
<h3>The 璇宮 (Xuan Palace) Officially Opens</h3>
<p>"Sinking Abyss" Honorary Performance</p>
<p>Since the Xuan Palace Theater began showing "Night Shanghai," the audience has been enthusiastic, and the newspapers have given it good reviews. However, because it was during a period of martial law, the opening ceremony could not be held. Therefore, it was specifically scheduled for the evening of the 18th, with Mr. Zhang Shankun, a giant in the film industry, officiating the opening, and Ms. Chen Yanyan cutting the ribbon. The evening's honorary performance will be Mr. Lin Ke's "Sinking Abyss," directed by Wu Jiangfan and starring Xia Xia, Vera, Zhang Ke, Tu Guangqi, Ye Lu, Sun Maoyun, Shen Ling, Xu Li, and others. With more than a month of rehearsals, the excellent performance is predictable.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden (Opera World)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Long-Legged General's Hall Meeting: Hanging Plaques and Splitting Plaques Occupy the Stage</p>
<p>Li and Zhang did not know the plot of the play, so I first described it to them. Then, it was handed over to the backstage to arrange for it to be performed the next day. In the play, Shu Yan played King Zhuang of Chu, Hui Sheng played the queen, Xiao Lou played Tang Jiao, and Chang Lin played Lian Yin Xianglao. During the celebration banquet in the play's Golden Palace scene, Shu Yan had a long section of "Quan Zitong Xiu De Yao Ba Ben Zou Shang" (劝梓童休得要把本奏上, advising the Empress not to present the memorial) in the Sanyan Xipi style. When Hui Sheng poured the wine, she sang and danced, with a long section of Er Liu (二六), all with many good arias. Xiao Lou had excellent acting and expressions when he was drunk and wild, and when he sobered up and repented. His performance in saving the Emperor and fighting was particularly brilliant. Although it rained heavily that night, and the colored awning was completely wet, the audience still stood under the corridors to listen until the end of the play before dispersing. Among the dan (female) actors this time, since Mei and Shang had not come and Yan Qiu had not yet become famous, Hui Sheng was particularly prominent. Moreover, she, along with Yang, Yu, Qian, and Wang (Chang Lin), were all members of the New Ming Grand Theater, so everyone naturally gave her extra support. However, when she was traveling south by train, she suddenly developed symptoms of "fa sha" (发痧, a type of illness), vomiting and diarrhea non-stop. Fortunately, Xiao Lou had brought "sha" medicine with him, which he gave her to take, and she became a little more stable. When the train arrived at Xuzhou Station, everyone got off, but all the cars in the city had been chartered by the reception office, specifically for the representatives of the various provinces residing in the city. On that day, all the Peking Opera actors arrived in Xuzhou, and even allocating dozens of cars to pick them up was still not enough. By the time Yan Qiu and Hui Sheng came out of the platform, there was not a single car left. Hui Sheng had a fever for a day and a night, and she was pale and emaciated, unable to walk a step. It so happened that I had a small matter to attend to at the station that day, so I went to the platform to have a look and immediately saw Hui Sheng's expression. Two stagehands were supporting her as she walked unsteadily. (83)</p>
