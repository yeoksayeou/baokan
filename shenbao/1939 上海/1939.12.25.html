<h3 id="c9">日本的政治季節 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>日本繼平沼掌政的阿部內閣，當其登台之初，正是日本慘遭納粹遺棄，國際地位全陷孤立的時候；所以阿部所標榜的大政方針、除却準備以全力解決中國事變而外，實以打開外交僵局爲最主要的任務。然而四個月來，阿部及其閣僚們，日常儘管用樂觀語調安慰其焦慮失望的國民，事實上則不惟對外關係絕無任何改善，甚至整個政府的根本外交基點還在游移動搖之中。這樣就無怪軍部方面已逐漸表示不耐，並懷疑到現內閣解法中國事件以及調整對第三國複雜爭端的能力；而一般人民也都在惶惑之中、期待着政府外交政策之闡明。</p>
<p>日本的第七十五届議會召集了，這是日本的政治季節，亦即是現內閣的一個當前難關。基於其特異的憲法，日本議會自始即未具備類似各憲政國家立法機關那種效能；對於政府指導控制的力量本已極爲薄弱，就連通過預算那唯一重大權力也受有重大限制。到「五一五」事變之後，政治脫出了常軌，議會作甩更縮小到有如烏脫萊女士所說僅等於一個橡皮印章。在中日戰爭進行期間所召集的七十三四兩届議會，雖也有一些照例的質問和論辯，而對於預算和軍費的通過却較以往數届更爲容易，對於軍部的黷武政策也不敢有一字的指摘。至於本届的議會，根本上不會有何成就，但以今日日政府處境的艱窘，內政外交的無辦法，侵華戰事的困頓，均遠較前此爲加甚，故此度議會中的質辯，無疑將較以往爲激昂熱烈，而政府對其本身的弱點，亦勢將無法規避或隱諱。近三數日中，議會正處理例行事務，新年並須休會，關於國事的重大爭辯大約要延到一月中下旬，也就正是美日商約蘇日漁約行將滿期失效的期間。在這二十餘日當中，如果阿部及其同僚們的種種運用再不能獲得切實效果，則在內外種種情勢激盪之下，日本政潮的再度爆發正恐難於避免。日來民政政友各政黨的突形活躍，是一件可注意的事，就連阿部自身也一再破例邀晤各黨首領懇予協力；這自然不能遽認爲具有政黨政治復活的意味，但亦可見日本政局正在暗潮低迷之中，因而也給予了政黨一些因利乘便的活躍機會。</p>
<p>這些情勢和困難，在阿部及其閣僚當然也曾想像到了的、所以月餘以來，他們幾乎竭盡全力進行種種對外談話與接洽，冀在外交上有所收穫以緩和內部危機；一方在東京，由外相野村等分別與列强駐日大使進行會談，一方由駐美大使崛內，駐英大使重光，駐蘇聯大使東鄉和新赴法國就任的大使澤田，在華盛頓倫敦莫斯科巴黎與各國外交當局從事談判。同時並鑒於美國朝野對日態度的强硬；續訂商約的希望之微薄，乃倉惶宣布準備開放長江下游；且續由海軍方面聲明，當於兩月之仙，設法予以實現，以冀减低國際間疑慮及不信任；其焦灼的窘況，實充分說明了日政府的急於要在議會集會之前，獲得緩和國際反感的切實結果；因此又懇求財閥暫時忍受不便，暫時犧牲一部分利益。</p>
<p>近一二日來，東京方面不斷傳來種種樂觀空氣，且傳證券市塲亦見了活氣。但事實上日方所得，最多不過是美國暫不準備對日援用經濟懲罰辦法；以及日法間懸擱十年的金借款案之獲得相當解決；這都是消極方面的一點收穫，對於日本目前國際地位與外交關係均不能謂爲已有何等具體改善，而在日政府則已大事誇張，稱道樂觀；無疑的，這類事態，不失爲興奮劑，藉以應付議會難關並緩和民間種種不滿。日本目前種種窘况全係侵華一舉所引起的必然結果，又豈是僅僅改善對各國外交關係所能挽救？退一步講，即使阿部野村眞能如願以償，獲得美日蘇日法日商約以及蘇日漁約的商訂，對於日本現狀究有幾分裨益且屬一大疑問，何况那還僅是日方片面的願望。日方今日之所能示惠於各國者，至多不過是以分潤掠奪所得爲餌；但以常識來判斷：列强執政者當均不致如此短視，爲了貪圖些許近利，竟把一切置之不顧，無形中支持了在動搖阽危中的日閥政權，俾其繼續侵略中國，並使世界離開安定與和平更遠。所以目前日政府自身的樂觀，並不値得如何重視；藉令阿部內閣暫能倖免於危，而其所標榜的解決中國事變與打開外交僵局的重大企圖，如果不根本放棄侵華一念與所謂「新秩序」，則終於證明不過心勞日拙毫無效　而已。</p>

<p>桂林航信、華軍於湘北大捷之後、日方兵力益疲、雖經短期之休息補充、究亦未達發動大規模新攻勢之能力、然日軍終於作最後一次的冒險、於十一月十六日在欽防沿海一帶登陸、進犯桂邊、茲紀該方面戰况如次、</p>
<p>去冬北海吃緊、華軍曾一度雲集粵桂邊境、凖備與來犯者迎頭痛擊、嗣後形勢變遷、南路無重兵控制之必要、乃以一部他調、據中外軍事觀察家之觀察、日軍經二年來之戰鬥、犧牲甚大、兵力早已不敷、如欲犯桂、至少非五個師團以上之兵力不可、在長沙會戰以前、日軍已無法抽調集中如許兵力、况湘北之役、元氣斵喪、絕難發動新攻勢、乃不顧一切、竟作犯桂之冒險舉動、據聞爲之嚮導者、乃爲黃明堂、黃原籍廣東、而粵桂邊境十萬大山、綿亘千數百里、崗巒起伏、形勢險要、歷年爲積匪出沒之區、黃深知此情、卽潛入鼓惑、無知之强粱、遂爲日軍所利用、</p>
<p>當日軍於企沙龍門港登陸後、初未料能有所進展、欽防濱海一帶、爲有名之「滄海沙原」、爲無法防守之區、但登陸之後、必須通過毫無掩護之沙原、則適爲華軍發揚火力之良好地形、不意匪衆導引、守軍致受其困、無法展其威力、於是欽防失守、日軍遂得立足之地、一方派兵北上、一方源源增援、間道潛入、趨小董大塘、偷渡鬱江、繞至邕賓路之三塘四塘、南寗遂不能守、</p>
<p>南寗之陷、時爲十一月廿四日下午二時、其前鋒竟爲十萬大山之匪部、守軍浴血抵抗、經激烈之戰後、始行放棄、南寗原爲西南交通要樞、但一切人力物資、均經事先疏散、不啻一座空城、常南寗吃緊之際、華方大軍源源南開、魏·黎·蘇·賀·戴等部、均奉命馳往堵截、戴部先頭部隊爲邵一之團、於廿四日下午趕抵南寗近郊、時邕　已陷、遂止於二塘、相機進擊、不意是時日軍得僞匪導引、竄抵三塘五塘一帶、邵團於行進間、突　日騎兵、經判定爲日軍前哨、倉卒就地散開截擊、於是展開一塲激烈戰鬥當時邵團形勢、頗為不利、蓋前後受夾擊也、幸所部士兵訓練有素、遇變不亂、遂得與日軍相　、一面應戰、一面設防、是日、日機數十架、輪流於該團陣地投彈轟炸、並用機槍射擊、同時日兵攻擊十餘次、該團官兵沉着抵抗、將每次來犯之日軍、殲滅於陳前、日機雖在、亦未發生効力、一日之間、日兵被擊斃者、達六七百人、當晚日軍大事增援、次日（廿五日）拂曉、大舉向華軍陣地猛衝、戰鬥極爲激烈、亦次第被華軍擊退、華軍傷亡官兵雖衆、但日軍之傷亡、至少在華軍三倍以上、旋日軍施放烟慕、全綫總攻、亦未得逞、戰鬥兩日、華軍始終未放棄寸土尺地、該部某步槍手射擊精確、曾於是日擊斃日機槍射手六人、終迫其轉移陣地、尤足稱道、</p>
<p>翌日拂曉、該團奉命突圍、邵團長一之親率兵二連衝鋒、霎那之間、連奪山頭二座、旋邵氏於高地上以望遠鏡瞭望敵情、不幸一彈飛來、遽中要害、竟作壯烈犧牲、該團吳團附其陞、見團長倒地、急率部搶救、不幸亦被日機槍射中、文副團長謨聞訊趕到、繼續指揮、向日軍逆襲、士氣賴以不墜、旋文副團長亦中日方砲彈破片、背部受傷四處、但終於奮勇指揮、將日軍擊退、總計鏖戰兩晝夜、斃傷日軍達九百餘入、該團損失亦達三四百人、激戰之烈、可想而知、南寗失陷後、兩軍陣勢、邕武路相持於大小高峯坳、邕賓路相持於七八塘之間、兩處皆崗巒起伏、地形險要、遂展開激烈爭奪、而尤以八塘附近爲激烈、當時日軍挾小勝之勇以臨華軍、設八塘不守、賓陽即將危殆、因是八塘之役、於南路戰局之安危、關係至鉅、</p>
<p>時戴師高團相繼到達、倉卒奉命扼守該地、本月一日奉命、實行局部反攻、高團長爲關　徵任師長時之營長、昔年血戰長城、殲敵無算、武漢外圍戰時、任杜師團長、伍家莊之役、孤軍苦守、屢寒敵膽、嗣改隸戴師、此次奉命後、黎明時、部署旣竟、攻擊令下、全體士兵各着輕裝越出戰壕、匍匐前進、迨與日軍接近時、殺聲齊作、手溜彈聲中、刺刀飛舞、勢若在風驟雨、衝入日陣肉搏、日兵戰鬥、向恃飛機大砲、遇華軍白刃相加、鮮不望風逃竄、此時日軍倉卒聞警、手足無措、略一接觸、紛紛潰走、死於華軍壯士刀刺彈斃者、達三數百人、屍塡壕窟、血滿溝渠、八塘當即克復、華軍將士、奮鼓餘勇、銜枚疾追、直抵七塘、阻於斷橋而罷、是役華軍所獲戰果極衆、將士傷亡不足日軍之牛數、日軍始無輕視之心、不敢再犯、而桂南戰局、賴以穩定、不爲無功、</p>

<p>自八一三戰事爆發、本市童軍參加戰地服務者達三千餘人、豐功偉績、已爲滬人所知、淞滬淪陷後、仍有三百餘男女團員、分佈戰地繼續服務、如南京城外搶渡、徐州突圍、開封洪流、馬廻嶺南撤、武漢破毀、廣州失陷、湘垣大火諸役、俱有本市童軍參加服務、在後方亦曾派員赴甘肅陝西·農村服務、去歲一二二五重慶大游行、及桂林空襲時之防護工作、均博得政府之嘉獎、</p>

<p>其次、談到嚴格批評方面、他們的立塲、是在避免多數靑年失學、希望大學能盡量容納、期儲備多才、蔚爲國用、其用意無非也是爲國家前途打算、値此抗戰建鬨兼程並進的時期、失學靑年太多、自非社會之福、戰後建設需才尤多、更非預爲籌劃不可、但自他方面來說、大學是人才敎育、並非人人可入、亦並非人人能入、大學的目的在造就專才、而不在救濟失學、如果所有中學畢業生一律須由大學容納、大學根本就用不着入學試騐、統一招寫根本就失去其意義、我在前面巳經說過、中學畢業生遷入大學、目前尚辦不到、事實上大學不能全部容納、且亦無此需要、去年統考的結果、對於未考及落第學生、敎育部會創辦先修班及各種專修科、以資容納、目的一方面在救濟靑年失學、一方面却在造就實用技術人才、以應急需、今年對於威績較次的學生、即錄取於先修班、予以補修的機會、明年再行投考、並且先修班的班次、已經由十餘班擴充到二十餘班、政府的苦心孤詣、於此可以想見、我們可以說統考關於先修班的設置、是在救濟失學而予以充分基本科目的訓練、大學新生的錄取、仍舊保持大學程度的標準、我們把前面錄取人數與各校容量對照來看、就可知道了、今年錄取的人數較各校需要人數尚差二千餘人、以科別論、除工學院各系與政治經濟等系外、差不多均未錄取足額、如果要降格以求的話、今年再放寬標準多取二千餘人是不成問題的、可見統考對於大學程度的標凖、仍然保持其高度、而對於標準以下的考生、則另設先修班以資救濟、至於未錄取四分之三的學生又有甚麼方法來補救呢、今年應考學生、其中同等學力近五千人、此等學生中學尚未畢業、仍可回中學肄業、其一部分可投考軍事學校及其他技術學校、以應抗戰急切的需要、一部分可投考專科學校及各種專修科、如必欲進大學謀深造者、仍可投考省私立專科以上學校、此等學校經敎育部核准招生之人數、約有五千餘人、各生亦不乏再試的機會、所以今年統考未錄取的學生、仍不致於失學、</p>
<p>（二）文實人數的懸殊　統考錄取的學生、文實相差懸殊、也是一般人所常批評的、現在把兩年來錄取文實兩類學生的比例列　如下、</p>

<p>照上列統計比較、以實類各科人數爲多、尤以工科爲最多、（一七五二人）但以實際需要來說、並不算多、因此今年設有工科各大學、以名額太多、原有班級不能容納、不得不增加班次、擴充名額、敎部今年因招生結果而增加的工科班級達十餘班之多、這就是適應實際的需要、</p>

<p>廉恥運動吿同胞書</p>
<p>本市各界廉恥運動委員會、以今日爲民族復興節、又爲雲南起義紀念及耶穌聖誕、特爲文敬告同胞、文曰、今日是民族復興節、雲南起義紀念、也是中國革命史上兩個重要關鍵、因爲中華民國的建立、旣是孫總理和多數革命先烈犧牲的結晶、再從實行、</p>
<p>三民主義發展而為世界大同的基石、不幸當時因少數政客、希圖苟安妥協、以及袁世凱醉心稱帝、遂使革命大業、無形中斷、革命基石、幾遭破壞、幸而蔡松坡·李烈鈞·唐繼堯等、組織護國軍、在雲南起義、各省相繼饗應、基石重行奠定、否則中華民國、更屬不堪設想、</p>
<p>西安事變在形式上、逞强刦持、不合大義、而在精神上、確係赫赫逼人的侵略之必然反響、總裁以偉大之民族人格、及信仰主義之決心、且得全國民衆之擁戴、故卒能化險爲夷、重返京華、同時更因此種歷史的轉變、步入了一個新的階段、團結全國民族、發動神聖抗戰、艱苦努力、以爭取中國之領土</p>
<p>主權完整及獨立自由、尤其是這一天恰是耶穌聖誕、耶穌所以改革猶太敎、因當時猶太人民處於異族統治之下又深受官僚地主豪紳之壓迫剝削、藉宗敎之敎義、以發展偉大之勢力、團結人心、但結果、終不容於猶太敎徒、和羅馬官吏、乃被釘於十字架上、代人受罪而死、上列三個事實、沒有一件不是發揚</p>
<p>人類正氣偉大之人格、不屈不撓、轉變人心、尤其在廉恥道喪之現在、又遇到含有三種意義的此日、更覺意義深長、然而我們在這一天所得的敎訓是什麼呢、我想第一、在堅持抗戰勝利愈趨接近的今日、每人只要負起雲南起義、總裁蒙難和耶穌救世三種重大意義的責任、再加以刻苦耐勞、</p>
<p>崇尙廉恥的精社、絕沒有人會中他人的奸計、第二、三民主義是中國最適合民族性的革命最高原則、更是歷史進化必然的歸宿、只要人人自愛、任何暴力、都無法加以阻止和破壞、中國抗戰、固然決於西安事變以後、要亦數千年來四維八德的一貫精神、一到最後關頭、即使無西安事變、也不得不伸張正義、團結一致、</p>
<p>國謀自救、在抗戰時期、當然免不了痛苦和犧牲、但這些是暫時的現象、暫時的忍受、抱定寗爲玉碎、小爲瓦全的決心、便是將來永久幸福光榮的代價、第三、耶穌鑒於痛苦的猶太人民、沒有國家、沒有領袖、並不委曲求全、貪生怕死、不顧一切、起而領導、一如雲南起義、頓使巨奸寒心、擊破帝制、又如西安之役、保全民族正氣、伸張</p>
<p>不屈精神、以造成狄人國內的杌隍不安徬徨無措的局面、同一意義、我人既臨到了這三個意義偉大的節日、那裏可以緘默而息、不和同胞一告呢、凡我同胞、不論階級地位、務必站定崗位、不爲利誘、不爲威脅、以發揚四維八德、造福無疆、抗建前途、實深利賴</p>

<p>昨日爲上海難胞合作社籌募生產基金而主辦的文藝展覽會開幕的第一日，筆者感覺到中國抗戰到底，不獲得最後勝利，決不中止，那末侵略方面，又勢成騎虎難以下台，於是這班遭遇無情砲火燬壞了田園的難胞，要想永久的繼續予以維持，專靠捐募的款項來作無窮消耗，雖然不乏慈善爲懷的人們，終覺不是優良辦法；並且難胞們飽食終日，未免日久成爲智慣，倒反養成了他們念惰的惡習，所以難胞合作社先生們，要使難民有了生產的工作，將來可不必專靠人家來養活，這是何等有意義的事，筆者就抽出一點工夫趕去參觀一下。</p>
<p>上午九時三刻，筆者到達該會時，立即購票入塲，所謂揭幕剪彩，根本沒有看見，但我的目的亦並不是爲去見識影星，就是沒有，也漫不在乎。不過有許多觀衆，擁擠在入口甬道上，似乎要看這幾位影星小姐，不曉得他們有否達到眼福，只聽得有一位學生小姐說：「他們還不是有兩隻眼睛，一個鼻子，有什麼希罕？」這是一句實在的話。甬道兩旁，懸掛着許多字畫，就中以沈生鏞的爲最多，沈恩孚老人次之。甬道盡端，折入一間小室，內中陳列着郵票和香烟畫片，仔細賞玩，頗有興趣，並且還可曉得我國郵票的歷史。大槪最早的郵票，是前淸光緒四年，那時紙質惡劣，印紋粗糙，顏色有紫綠黃三色，中印盤龍，上兩角爲價目字。孝欽皇后六十萬壽郵票，中印篆壽字，紙質顏色，和前一樣而形略大。直到光緒二十四年，始由英國印製，質料也精良。還有蘇維埃郵票，是中國紅軍第三軍團第五軍第一師政治部寄與湖南平江劉積才的，這是我們少看見的。其餘各國郵票，應有盡有，眞是五光十色，目不暇接。香烟畫片中有古美人的，花草的，鳥獸的，格言的三十六行的，科學智識的，形形色色，可以說到集香烟畫片的大成。再進大廳，除書畫外，有影星照片，語文變遷圖，苗猺動態照，逐一瀏覽，眞是長進見識不淺。</p>
<p>內中書畫，我最愛陳天嘯的「東坡探梅」，「無量壽佛」，「柳馬」，「雙宿雙棲」幾幅，着墨不多，而神態逼眞，雄偉浩澣，蘊蓄無窮，非有藝術天才者，不可以學而致。余以黃警頑君之介紹，得與把晤，立談頃刻，秀外慧中四字可以陳大嘯君而無愧色。</p>
<p>古畫有「崔白花鳥」，「李唐山水」，「嘉佑御筆」，「王仲元花鳥」，全係工筆，栩栩如生，而標價並不高，如人得一幅，懸之座右，公餘賞玩，大有雅人深微之概，何况在抗戰中爲救濟難胞的一紀念品呢！</p>

<p>二十七年三月實施管　外匯後，上海乃有外匯暗市之產生。同年九月暗市匯價出現八便士之低水凖，政府當局即努力維持，匯價乃得穩定，本年三月中英合作之外匯平凖基金成立，外匯暗價，更趨堅固。不過，維持黑市外匯，徒以鉅額資金供日僞扒吸，及上海奢侈消耗，似非得計也。六月七日乃有停止外匯供給之實施，結果，跌風驟起，自八便士降至六便士半以下。但此跌風，仍不足以調整國際貿易之逆勢；而日僞之扒吸，雖稍受挫，猶未能退止，故又任其再跌爲五便士半。一般不明眞相及短視者，乃庸人自擾，大起恐慌；投機份子及一般奸徒，筏乘機散佈謠言，堆波助瀾，因而惹起大量資金之逃避，致外匯暗市，繼續猛縮，七月二十五日爲四便士五六二五，八月一日降爲四便士三一二五，八月八日復降爲三便士八七五，八月十一日更跌落至三便士二五，造成法幣空前之低價。</p>
<p>自後，歐局緊張，外匯暗市受此刺激，一反過去劇落之風，而轉爲猛漲之勢。昔日外滙投機者與資金逃避者均紛紛脫售，暗市塲上外滙之供給，一時供過於求，於九月四日暗價達四便士七五。其間一度回軟，尤以美匯之降跌較英金爲甚，蓋是時紐約市塲鎊價劇落，故滙豐掛牌創美匯五元半之最低價。及九月底滙價再見回漲，其續漲之勢，達月餘之久。十月底已長至英匯五便士半美匯八元半之水凖，一時曾近六便士與上美元之滙價。考其高漲之因，不外乎下列數端：（一）因歐戰爆發，輸入銳减，輸出則因美銷旺盛，尚能維持　於是暗市塲有大量出口匯票之出現，而進口外匯之需要减少。（二）自査港與南洋各地實施匯兌管　後，於是港帮等相繼來滬拋出外匯。（三）資金逃避者因法幣信用鞏固，相繼歸回，外匯頭寸驟增。（四）日方吸　减弱，且亦有小額拋出，外匯需要益减。（五）外幣信用本身動搖，一般投機者均去　之他；於是暗　價又少一重壓力。常此外匯高漲之際，又有前方捷報之傳來，人心益定。此種漲風，至十一月中旬始趨穩定，而徘徊於五便士左右。但輸出雖增，輸入亦增，如紡織廠之棉花及人民主要糧食之食米，現今均須海外供給，故進口商結款頗殷，加以國際游資來往不定，使外匯暗市時起波動。投機者又乘機參　，故是月下旬起又略見回落。年暮以法幣需要增加，故匯市又在回漲聲中。茲錄匯豐掛牌及暗市收盤如次：</p>
<p>（註）英匯係國幣一元合便士數。（一）爲十二月十九日之外匯匯價。</p>
<h3 id="c83">一年來之內債行市 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>一年來之內債行市，尚稱穩定。其間雖有三度變動，但其後均能回漲，現今價格與年初相近。由此可知中國財政之良好。</p>
<p>年初財部有遷渝結付到期本息之計劃，促成第一次變動。嗣後在滬分期支付，始告平息。其後各債回漲，於六月十三日，創開戰以來之最高紀錄。在六月十九日電傳財部對關稅担保之統一各債，以稅款被奪，亦有停止墊付之說，於是發生第二次變動。及七月中外滙猛縮之際，統一各債又見狂瀉，創開戰以來之最低價矣。此爲第三次變動。歐戰爆發後，債市大堅，統一各債，復趨回復。</p>
<h3 id="c84">一年來之外債行市 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>年初，外債行市，均見低落，其後有回漲之勢。六月外滙平凖基金委員會停止供給外滙後，倫敦市塲，中國外債一致狂瀉，七八月上海外滙猛縮之際，外債亦繼續跌落。歐戰後始趨穩定。十一月中旬，且起猛烈漲風，較十月均漲十鎊以上。十一月十五日，如英德續借款達五十七鎊，中法公債達五十二鎊，英法借款達五十鎊，較之日本外債，高漲甚多，同日之日本五厘英公債爲四十九鎊，第一次四厘英公債僅四十鎊半，由此可知，中國之國信較日本爲佳，中國國運前途較日本光明。茲錄倫敦市塲中國主要外債之平均價於下：</p>
<p>（註）單位鎊（一）爲十一月一—十八日之最高價（二）爲十二月址五—十八日之平均市價。</p>
<h3 id="c85">一年來之對外貿易 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>本年對外貿易呈躍進之勢，輸出增加較輸入尤速。自三月以來，每月之進口總値均在一萬萬元以上；歐戰發生後，進口稍减，今又漸復原狀。且更爲促進輸出之良機。（單位千元）</p>
<p>入超數字，在五六月達於極點。停止供給外滙後，即告激减。歐戰後更减，十月已僅五百萬元。以現今之趨勢，將來或有出超希望。進口貿易在政府統制與外滙跌落下尚如此鉅大，殊堪注意；致此之道：上海消費增大，一也；用中國外滙購日本工廠所需原料，如棉花等；二也；人民日用必需品之食米煤等，均爲人壟斷，不得不仰給海外，三也；日貨傾銷，四也；投機旺盛，囤風大熾，五也；不勞利得收入增加乃縱情消費，奢侈品輸入增加，六也。以上六端不除，進口貿易　時難望激减。至於出口貨物增加之主因如下：後方交通發展，運輸較前便利，故輸出力增大，此其一。日商搜刮淪陷區內之土產運售歐美，以攫取中國之出口外滙資源；亦爲要點之一；此其二。外滙低落，士貨易於外銷，此其三。上海輕工業已復戰前狀態，但製造品不能暢銷於淪陷區，不得不謀海外銷路，此其四。海外需要增加，如生絲之銷美，動物及動物產品之銷歐，及製造品之銷南洋，均爲近年來之最高紀錄，此其五。况今又有歐戰良機，祗須全國人民之努力，北輸出必能再增。</p>
<h3 id="c86">一年來之物價 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>年中物價高漲，人民生活大受威脅。昔日高漲者，尚限於進口品及生活次要品，故一般人民，尚不感艱難。現今奸商以生活必需品爲目標，居奇囤積，以待善價，影響民生者實大。茲就國定稅則委員會所編躉售物價指數觀之，有如次列；</p>
<p>二十八年　二十七年</p>
<p>一月　一六二·一　一三三·六</p>
<p>二月　一六五·五　一三二·四</p>
<p>三月　一七二·一　一三三·二</p>
<p>四月　一七三·二　一三六·七</p>
<p>五月　一七六·一　一三五·八</p>
<p>六月　一九〇·七　一三八·九</p>
<p>七月　一九五·五　一四六·四</p>
<p>上述僅限於首七個月之物價指數，其高漲程度，已屬驚人。况七月以降，漲風更盛。試觀上海之生活費指數，即可知之。七月爲一八八·五六，八月達二三四·一七，九月狂漲，爲一八三·二三，十月稍落，亦爲二四八·二二。今日物價高漲之主因，大部為奸商囤積所致，其次爲交通不便，供應不均。若長此以往，則平民生計將益不安。故我政府對於物價之調整，正在努力進行中。（十二月二十日）</p>
<h3 id="c87">過去一週 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>平糶劫搶　據報載，曹家渡某米店因見業衆有湧來搶米之勢，老板便接受店夥的建議，實行以三十八元一石平　，得免被刧。這實在是深知搶米風潮的原因，同時實又賽過以半開門防搶的良法。値得介紹無孔不入　日僞爲遂其以點養戰之目的，對各種有利可圖之機會，莫不多方剝削，過去組織「魚市塲」以統制魚業，組織「牲畜市塲」以統制運滬之牛羊鷄鴨等，並對輸滬之糧食，多方阻撓，加以勒捐，雖然上海米價高漲，尚有囤積居奇等各種複雜因素在內，但日僞的剝削亦爲主要原因之一；今據報載，孤軍堅守之四行倉庫，現正大加修葺，以備闢作「蔬菜市塲」，統制蔬菜及鹹貨之用，如此則升斗小民，在米，煤，油，麵，壓迫之下，又將遭受新威脅，上海居，誠大不易矣。</p>
<p>— 洪</p>
<p>皆大歡喜　年關轉瞬將屆，各業都忙着結帳，木年因爲外匯的變動，物價的高漲，無論工商企業，莫不盈利纍纍，所以最近如紗廠等股票，價格一致上漲，據云獲利最豐者爲米，棉，紗，油等各業，大約紗廠職員又將有一百個月紅利可分；銀錢界從事外匯投機者均亦獲利驚人。上海有如此鉅利可賺，當然樂不思蜀，把投資西南，建設後方的重大任務，一古腦兒拋開，言之實堪痛心。而獲利者，固皆大歡喜，罔然不覺。</p>
<p>— 洪</p>
<p>何時罷休　本市米市塲管理委員會，自實行緊急處置，限制米價而後，一般米店，同時爲了搶米之風大盛，都關起店門來，在一個小洞裏營業。有的人家，洞口小得淘籮都塞不進去，使升斗小民，買米非常不便，人一多就非在洞口久候不可，不勝其苦。前天起雖有全體米店復業之說，但一部分米店，還是關着店門，甚至寫出「本號存貨售罄，暫停營業，一待進貨，再行交易」的字條。一般小米店，都存觀望態度，祇出不進，先把存貨賣完了再說，以致有的有粳無秈，有的有秈無粳，貨缺不全。你去買米，弄得不好，就一連要撞幾家。這種情形，對於糴米的人的確太不便，我們希望米業當局，從速設法，使米店一律開鬥，以减買米者的不便之苦！</p>

<p>陳潔君問：　中央銀行掛牌，上海標準標金價，係以常日關金行市乘定數57979而得。但標金成色爲九七八，而中國純金收買價祗高於標準金價不及五元，如十二月十三日中央掛牌，上海標凖標金價＄1,366,20，同日中國純金收買價＄1.370.90，請示其計算根據及方法</p>
<p>姜佐宣先生答：　中央銀行掛牌上海標準金價與純金收貿行市，俱以倫敦金價爲標準計算而來。茲分別將其計算方法，說明於左：</p>
<p>（A）標凖標金</p>
<p>標金一條等於市平十兩成色九七八，每一市平兩則等於一·〇〇四七一〇七盎斯，故標金一條實等於九·八二六〇七〇盎斯10×.978×1.0047107＝9.8260707</p>
<p>今倫敦金價旣爲每金盎斯八鎊八先令（合二〇一六便士），而中央銀行掛牌英匯行市，仍爲一先令兩便士半（合一四便士半），可得左列等式——</p>
<p>2016÷14.5×9.8260707＝1366.16四捨五入，卽得一三六六·二〇元</p>
<p>（B）、純金收買行市　此處雖云純金，但其成色亦不過九九九。如是十兩純金，按上述比例計算，實等於一〇·〇三七〇六金盎斯</p>
<p>40×999×1.0047107＝10.03706倫敦金價爲二〇一六便士，而中央銀行收買純金，以外匯售價一先令兩便士又四分之三（合一四便士七五）計算，可得算式—2016÷14.75＝10.03706＝1371.84四捨五入，即得一三七一·八〇元。</p>
<p>來函所舉十二月十三日中國純金收買價爲一三七〇·九〇元，但中央銀行掛脾則爲一三七一·八〇，想係誤抄，再定數五七九·七九，係五〇七·七九之訛。</p>
<p>陳潔君問：　商業新聞欄各國貨幣價格，英金票及美金票係照外匯行情爲計算標準，但另有英金鎊及美金鎊兩種行市，如十二月十三日英票＄46.00英鎊＄95.60美票＄13.12美鎊＄98.00，上項英鎊美鎊之價格，不知根據何種標凖</p>
<p>姜佐宣先生答：商業新聞欄所載之「英金票」或「美金票」，係指該國紙幣而言；至於「英金鎊」或「美金鎊」，則指硬幣（以黃金鑄造者）而言。前者因係紙幣，故其價格，以外匯行情為計算標凖：後者因係金幣，故其價格，以所含之純金量爲計算標準。</p>
<p>按英金鎊一枚所含之純金量約爲七·三二公分（Grain），而美金鎊一枚（面額五元）所含之純金量約爲一一六·一〇格蘭（Grain）。如照左列比率折合市平兩，（市平一兩等於三一·二五公分，又等於四八二。二六格蘭）</p>
<p>每一英金鎊所含之純金，約等於市平二錢三分。（7.32÷31.25＝0.23）</p>
<p>每一美金鎊所含之純金，約等於市平二錢四分。（116.1÷482.26＝24）</p>
<p>今上海黑市金價爲四千餘元（按十兩計），故英美金鎊價格，各爲九十餘元也。</p>
<p>潘恒勤先生答，陸秀川君問，因問題太多，容於下期發表。尚祈　　！</p>

<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>食物本草云：「雉肉味酸寒，無毒，雖野味之貴，食之損多益少，惟十一月食之有補。」卿按雉即俗名野鷄是也，照食物本草所云，冬至前後食之有益，其餘月分皆有損也。西洋風俗，於耶穌聖誕節，（俗呼外國冬至），必食火鷄，想與吾國冬至之食雉同意。</p>
<p>養生集要云：「冬至陽氣歸納腹中，熱物入內易消化。」卿按熱物入腹易於消化，不但冬至，即餘月他時，亦宜食熱物也。然今年柴炭之貴，較前數倍，眞有柴薪如桂之嘆，中人之家，亦感不給矣，貧民安得熱物入腹，而講衛生耶？</p>
<p>法天生意云：「冬至後五日，夫婦當別寢戒容止，犯者减壽。」卿按：冬令萬物宜藏，吾人更宜攝生，不藏而數動，則傷其本元，故多病而减壽，此理易明。前云，冬至後五日，夫婦當別寢，吾不謂然，夫夫婦之道，四時皆宜愼行，入冬即須分離，冬至後則尤要戒絕也。富室男女，入冬即服補藥，想是救其不別寢之損，不知藥石之力，豈能補根本之失哉？今逢冬至，吾願慣服補藥者，遵古別寢之戒，省些金錢，維持貧民衣食，以養天和也。</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>耶誕令節，不單是「玩」的季節，而且也是「吃」的季節。今晚的「耶誕晚餐」，在華燈煇皇，樂聲鏗鏘裏，展開富麗的塲面。內中最不可少的點綴是火鷄。</p>
<p>那肥碩的吐綬鷄，（火鷄別名）赤黃色的，靑銅色的，黑色的，白色的，經過濃油，甜醬的高手烹調，一大盆……的羅列在舖着雪白櫃單大菜桌上，調味精良，膾炙人口，於是「耶誕火鷄」要算是「耶誕晚餐」中的最時髦的食品了！</p>
<p>那紅，黃，綠，白，各色的「耶誕布丁」（俗稱耶誕蛋糕）方塊形的，三角形的，同樣羅列在火鷄之旁，以供吃「耶誕晚餐」之後的餘興！</p>
<p>說到「耶誕晚餐」，在英國習俗，視同吾國的「團圓夜飯」晚餐時，闔家團坐聚食，卽遠客異鄕，不及趕回家中聚餐的，也必爲之虛左一位，祈禱，祝福。</p>
<p>印度地方，在這天沒有「耶誕飯店」供給客居遠方的英人，作一次耶誕晚餐的歡聚。</p>
<p>星加坡地方的耶誕節日，異常熱鬧，據說這裏「海上爲生」的漁業中人，雖値霧季氣候，逢到耶誕，也必趕回家中，像在祖國是一樣的「團坐，歡叙。」</p>
<p>至於美國的紐約，芝加哥等處吃的「耶誕晚餐，」都是有劉伶之癖，和太白遺風者的世界，酒客們灌飽了酒，醉歌，醉舞，往往酒氣薰天，嘔吐狼藉，很多醉倒街頭而呼呼入睡的。</p>
<p>筆者更有附帶籲求的，就是今天上海的「耶誕晚餐」，大家不要太放浪形骸了，何不推耶穌博愛之心，將就些餐福之慾，而人人移一口之費，或節的一些，呢救救顚連無告的難胞呢？</p>
<h3 id="c95">聖餐食物考 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在耶誕的餐宴席上，菜單上面，菜餚是很多的。據西方的傳說，古代在撒克遜民族的大禮堂中，宴會之初，就先要爲飲酒者祝福，接着濃香的麥酒，便送進了各人的嘴巴。這種宴會，全盛的時代，恐怕就在伊利莎葩的時期，那時聖誕夜的餐宴席上，菜餚竟有一百二十碟之多。一般的王室中，舉行耶誕餐宴都是如此。那個時候對於慶祝耶誕的熱閙情形，也可說到達最高峯了</p>
<p>耶誕的來臨，是一年一度，在傳統上，直到現在，耶誕的前夜，要舉行聖餐。而在餐宴席上，普通火鷄，燒牛肉，梅布丁，肉包子，和橘千汁，這些是必不可少的。然而在英國一百三十年前，白金漢王宮舉行聖餐時，情形有些不同。在菜單上面，梅布丁一道是减去的，換上一盤很厚的草梅粥，而且排在第一道。但在黑金漢公爵的家裏，肉包子先後要出兩道，而梅布丁也是沒有的。橘子汁是不可少的一道，而且用眞正的鮮橘濾成的，更盛行用中國種的橘子濾汁，取其甘而味美。</p>
<p>在聖餐席上，那時蔬菜也很多，也許會使一股的人表示驚異。那時英國王宮中的一個廚丁是英國人，而且跟一個威爾士的名廚學過烹飪術，他的手段的確非常高明，一般廚丁，都無出其右。餐宴時出過七道葷菜之後，至少拿出六道蔬菜，不是放在餐桌上，或是放在另外的一張桌子上。到了十二月二十五日，耶誕那天，他就先送出米粥，接着就是一道火鷄，和一道地菌。桌子的另一面，放着一碟鷄鴨什粥，和一碟牛腰肉。地菌在英國，有許多地方可以找到。</p>
<p>其他的菜餚，在葷菜方面，有猪油甜麵包，上面用蘆笋，豌豆作爲裝飾，一碟鹹猪肉，一道牛舌頭，兩碟兔子肉，上面澆層酸醬，羊肉燒胡瓜，牛肉牛腰雜炒，香菌炒雜，羊脚燒隱元豆，子鷄燒鴨兒芹，牡蠣餅，鷓鴣，兩頭珠鷄，六頭鷸，一頭雉鷄。</p>
<p>至於蔬菜，包括花甘藍，耶路撒冷菊芋根，菠菜，法國豆，蘆笋，紅甘藍，香菌。甜菜方面，並不十分豐富，包括一道粉甜餅，一道捲心菜餅，一道乳餅，甜包子，小饅頭，鷄蛋糕，奶油餅等，就上文所說，可知百年之前，耶誕餐宴席上，菜餚的豐富，遠過今日。但現的耶誕餐宴，菜餚雖比較簡單，而有許多還是以過往的傳統爲根據的。</p>
<h3 id="c96">耶誕布丁 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>西俗每年到了耶誕節，在宴會上或　席上，總少不了這一件東西—耶誕布丁。關於這種「耶誕布丁」是可以隨着主婦們或廚司們的技巧，隨時做出各種不同的式樣；所以，亦是一件艱難的工作。下面是各國人士對於耶誕布丁所特有的奇俗：</p>
<p>在瑞典及丹麥，都把耶誕布丁做成外觀似豬頭般的樣子，非俟耶誕日過後是不食的。</p>
<p>在德法兩國，耶誕布丁都是製成一隻隻奇異的動物的形狀的。</p>
<p>在波蘭，是先用水和麵粉拌和後再製，而在布丁面上，更刻着一句句寺僧們用的祝語，非待該日入晚後，是不能將耶誕布丁動食的。</p>
<p>在羅馬尼亞，有一種習俗，所謂「耶誕布丁」，祇是一片片乾硬的餅乾，食時須加以蜂蜜等糖汁。</p>

<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>天天吃兩葷兩素，翻來翻去，總是這一套，實在也翻不出甚麼花樣來。如今我却有一個調劑的方法，就是每星期吃一次麵食，或菜飯，倒也可以換換口味，吃麵時可以按照麵館裏過橋辦法，來一個冬笋炒肉絲，或紅燒牛肉紅燒羊肉。吃菜版時，那麼只須一大碗湯，無論雞血豆腐或肉片蛋花湯都好，吃菜飯就不覺得太乾了。至於菜飯的煮法，可經濟也可不經濟，經濟的：單用靑菜或薺菜；倘要耐咀嚼一些，便可加些山芋，芽豆之類在內。你要再講究一些，那麽冬笋丁鮮肉片醃肉丁，可以儘量的放進去，就是以雞片鴨片爲代，亦未嘗不可。</p>

<h3 id="c98">耶誕節的衣食住行 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 殷紅</p>
<p>當每年的歲尾時候，就會使人不期而然的想起耶誕節來，的確，軍以上海來說，不論在沿馬路各大商店的櫉窗裏，或者在報章上的各處地方都可以看到一個紅衣白鬚的老人，背上掮了個裝得滿滿的包裹，駕着一輛鹿撬；這就是人們最歡喜的「耶誕老人」呀！而且尤其是小朋友們最覺得快樂，因爲耶誕老人會給他們愛吃的各種糖果，但一般人們呢？更把這個耶誕節當做了狂歡節。不論在「衣食住行」方面，都願意大家在歡快樂一宵來慶祝的。現在姑且談一下有關於耶誕節的「衣食住行」。</p>
<p>耶誕節是由歐美傳入的，所以在歐美各國每逢到這個日子，不論是父母或者做孩子的，都要穿上一身簇新的衣服，帶了許多的禮物，去贈給自己的親友們一到了親戚的家裏，人家看見了你的衣服這麼的簇新，就預料你將必定會得到耶誕老人的幸福的。在各地的戲院裏，都有新裝比賽大會的舉行，大概以一般少女們參加的爲多，伊們穿了特別花樣鮮明炫耀的新裝各自比賽，請參觀的人們評判，如果能够被選做第一名的話，大家就確認伊來年必定會得到意外的好運的。</p>
<p>吃的東西，在耶誕節要算最多，像耶誕蛋糕耶誕布丁之類，都是必要的食品，其中最著名而作爲唯一佳饌的，要算是美國產的火鷄了。但是，因爲它味美而肥的緣故，所以價錢也非常貴在歐美各國要購買一隻火鷄，就需要美金二十元左右，可是今年自從歐戰爆發後，各地貨運都告阻滯，火鷄當然也不能例外，於是價格飛漲到二倍以上。在上海方面，除了美國火鷄外，定海舟山所產的火鷄也很有名，每年運滬的數量極多，可惜現在舟山巳告淪陷，所以來源稀少，價錢也貴了些。耶誕節還有個風俗，要人們發明一種新奇而鮮美的食品來預卜將來的財運呢？</p>
<p>在英國北部牧林遜羣島的幾個城鎭上，有一個相沿的習俗，就是每逢耶誕節那天的夜間，要到一個山坡邊的森林中去露宿，連一般小朋友們都去，到了第二天的淸早，小朋友一起身就看見自己的襪子裏裝滿了許多的糖菓食物，於是快樂得很，父母們告訴孩子說是聖克勞斯老人贈給的，因此小朋友們永遠就喜歡那個老人了。其實這些都是他們的父母裝在袋中的呵！</p>
<p>聖誕節之夜，歐美各國的每個城市等處的人們，都變成了瘋在一樣，大家熱烈地慶祝着，無論什麽跳舞塲，酒排間，電影院，跑冰塲等處，都充滿了在歡的氛息，快樂地盡情歡娛一宵。其實在上海，又何嘗不如此呢？一夕在歡的所費，每個人至少須幾十元以上，眞可說是窮極奢侈的了。不過，今年的上海，雖然仍舊像平日一樣玩上一夜，但歐美各國因爲戰爭的火藥氣充溢的緣故，恐怕沒有從前一般在歡作樂了吧！</p>

<h3 id="c99">電車加價 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 紀方</p>
<p>在擾攘了許多時候的電車加價問題，在最近一次工部局的局務會議席上終於獲得了通過，而且已於本月二十二日起，電車公司正式宣告實行了。</p>
<p>本來，電車加價這一問題，　視之似乎是一個極其細微的事件，根本用不到我人重視的，更不配把它提到報上來討論，然而在今日上海這樣社會擾攘不安，米珠薪桂的現實環境下，一般人們欲求每日三餐之不斷，衣着禦寒之可以無憂者，已屬不容易，那裏再能經得起生活問題另一軍的負担關於行的方面的電車增加車資呢？這樣，對於電車公司在今日提出來增加車資，所以便成了社會問題，而且又加予一般中下階級人們的一層直接的打擊。這裏，姑讓我把它的旣成事實來分析一下罷：</p>
<p>第一，就電車公司的本身理由來說，託故於外匯的進縮，支出浩大，收支不能得合，所以認爲增加車資才是一個謀收支均平的最好辦法。關於這個，我們知道，站在電車公司的立塲上講，固有相當道理，然而究其實際，又是似是而非，牽强得很的。因爲今日外匯的進縮，誠然是事實，然而我人回想起外滙行市進縮得最爲屬害的本年七八月間，恐怕要算最爲低跌的了，但是電車公司為什麼不於那時立即就再增車資（因有於今年七月初已經加過一次），至少要比現在要合於事實些。</p>
<p>第二，這次電車公司的增加車資，聽說並不僅爲增加車資而已，乃在更變站程，而且每一站程間所增加車資的値數，似乎定得太高昂了。</p>
<p>第三，這回電車的增加車資，僅爲公共租界的英商電車公司，法商電車的車資，仍未增加或變更。由此我人可知，雖然二者間的統系不同行政各異，然則法商電車公司又何獨計不及此，慷慨如是呢？</p>
<p>總之，電車原爲公共經營的企業，其旨乃在便利人民，况益以公共經營企業的特性觀察，並不完全在於謀利的，並且我人又可以明白知道的，凡乘電車的人士，大多皆以中下階級的人士居多數，因利其迅捷和價格上之便宜，而今際茲孤島生活不易，百物昂騰居奇不已聲中，又增添了一層意外的負担，眞使人不能不喊出「孤島居，大不易」的呼聲來了。我之所以目此爲社會上之嚴重問題者，其原因亦即在於這裏。</p>
<p>最後，電車公司的增加車資，現在旣爲旣成事實了，並且較之「八一三」滬戰剛發生時，幾已有增多一倍的趨勢，但是我還願工部局和公司當局有以熟籌之，即於上海局勢比較轉佳，公司收入比較增加以後，亦立刻把它重新减低和訂定，勿使「增價容易减價難一成功了定論。</p>
<h3 id="c100">舉一個例 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 胡蒂</p>
<p>公共租界的電車於二十二日起又加價了。據公司宣稱的加價理由，是外匯緊縮，收支不能相抵。外匯緊縮是事實，收支不能相抵，那是我輩小民不敢妄加臆測了。然而就耳目所能及的情形看來，即使眞的收支不能相抵，那末，這「收支不能相抵」也不是加價所可以彌補的。（關於這一層，公司當局是大槪是很明白的。）</p>
<p>滬戰以後「孤島」人口激增至五百萬，電車是公用事業，人口增加，電車營業自然也隨之增加，這祇要看羣聚在站頭上的乘客，常爲了車中乘客擁擠，賣票不肯開門，而引起糾紛可以知道的。同時，爲了供應各處市民的便利起見，戰後添闢了二十四路（貫通英法租界）及二十路二條新路綫。這二條新路綫上的營業如何，不必細查賬目，公司當局總也是很明白的。</p>
<p>或許這增加的收入，還是不能抵銷外滙上的損失，而逼使公司當局出之於加價一途，也許是可能的。不過，恕我嚕囌，電車是公用事業，不能和二房東，奸商相提並論的。生活程度這樣高漲，市民生活力凋敝，電車公司應該在可能範圍之內，作統盤之計算，如何撙節無謂的開支，及杜塞巨大的漏巵。</p>
<p>同時，乘坐電車之輩，都是中下階級之乎民，加價在表面上果然是增加收入的先决條件，但實際上或有不盡然者，試舉一個例：</p>
<p>筆者曾和一位黃包車夫偶然談起「生意」問題，據他說：現在黃包車的生意是遠不及從前了，米價却漲到四十多，車價又不能十分抬高，譬好從前一毛錢的路程，現在至多討價一毛五分，再多，更找不到主顧了。</p>
<p>生活在「孤島」上的每個人，總不能否認這話的眞實性，於此可見，有許多人，已經坐不起黃包車了。而這又比不得肚子餓了，逼着去搶米，我們的兩條腿，多走一點路，也是牠應盡的義務。</p>
<p>從這例子更進一層，電車加價後，必有一部份人也從電車階級而降到人行道上去了。</p>
<p>現在加價是「旣成事實」了，不過爲電車公司當局計，月將這例子作一個備忘錄，除加價之外，請再想想其他可以彌補「收支不能相抵」的辦法沒有</p>

<p>第十九回　看花賞月活動成家　種玉孕珠娠姙有術</p>
<p>據製造那種家庭旅行車的人說：『這種車子，冬天一樣可以裝暖氣，夏天一樣可以裝冷氣，一切都和人家的住屋裏一樣。』本來那些家庭旅行車，喚作「活動的家」，就算是一個活動的家庭，一座房屋，不能撑了它向四處跑，這就要到那裏，便到那裏了。此外窗帘地衣，也都色色完備。車子的後面，還有個小小月台，倘有一對愛人，促膝談心，看花賞月，也是最適宜的地方。倘然那車子，停在水木明瑟之區，風景幽蒨之地，好花爲壁，芳草如茵，這豈不是更令人有一種說不出的愉快？金澹雲旣答應了蘇理雅太太，把三種車都試用着，那末儘這個蜜月裏，擬向上海相近的各處風景區域內走走。不過她不主張有些新婚夫婦，就在結婚的當天晚上，便出去旅行，有的還悄悄地不告訴人家旅行的去處，這眞似逃跑的一般了。還有一件事，那種家庭旅行車，你要請公司裏派一個開車的人來也可，或者你不要開車的人而自己開車也可。像林建成與金澹雲，都是會開汽車的，但他們所開的，都是個人乘坐的汽車。這樣大型的汽車，開是他們都可以開，未免太吃力了。新婚中還要習於勞作，未免失去休息之旨。由公司中派一個開車的來，原是最好，但新婚中的夫婦，不免相偎相倚，情話依依，東方人的習慣上，禮儀上，不願在第三人的面前，做出過於親密的態度。而且或者流連夜景，一對伉儷，就住在車子上，道旅行車中本是設備好的。可是這個開車的，只好把他據走了，不然，「臥榻之傍，豈容他人酣臥」呢？可是金澹雲却是另打了一個主意，她說：「試車的事，既經答應了蘇理雅太太了，我想的幾個朋友一同去游玩，做一個公開的蜜月旅行。那末開車儘管敎公司裏派人來，我們誰高興去自己開車呢？」又問林建成道：「你可贊成嗎？你有男朋友來嗎？要不然，我就請我的姊妹淘了。」林建成對於金澹雲是惟命是從的，因說：『我沒有男朋友，而且來一個陌生人是沒有意思，請女朋友是最好。』所以這件事，在他們未結婚之前，就商量好了。她的吳君素去，就是爲了這事。　（二一九）</p>

<h3 id="e8">Chairman Chiang of the National Senate Explains the Knowledge That Should Be Possessed for the Implementation of Constitutional Government. <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: On the day after the fourth session of the National Senate passed the "Motion to Convene a National Assembly to Enact a Constitution and Implement Constitutional Government," Chairman Chiang gave a detailed explanation of the specific knowledge that should be possessed for the implementation of constitutional government. The secretariat of the National Senate has obtained a record of this explanation, which is hereby published to draw the attention of those who are concerned about constitutional issues. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding political facilities, the various ministries and commissions of the government have all made detailed reports. What I want to talk about is the constitutional issue that everyone is concerned about. I believe that this session has two major gains. First, we passed the motion to promulgate the constitution early. Second, we resolved to convene a National Assembly on a regular basis to designate the constitution. Promulgating the constitution early, so that the country can have a permanent fundamental law, so that the scale of national construction can be completely established, so that the people can strive for national affairs, and have a clear and common standard for obligations and rights, is not only what the national sages expect, but also a major event that the central government has been constantly striving for in the past ten years. As for Zhongzheng personally, since the government promulgated the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage in the Republic of China in 1931, so that the people of the whole country jointly shoulder the responsibilities of the country, I have always felt that the unfinished business of the Premier and the ultimate goal of the revolution must be completed by us catching up. My eagerness to have the constitution formulated and promulgated as soon as possible must be deeply understood by all of you and the compatriots of the whole country without my own explanation. Now we are building the country in the midst of the war of resistance, in order to raise the awareness of our people's responsibility and to lay a lasting and solid foundation for our country's future. The bill for convening the National Assembly on a regular basis to formulate the constitution that was passed yesterday will certainly occupy a very important page in the history of the Republic of China. We and all colleagues, in the relationship of being in the same boat through wind and rain, are not only sharing weal and woe, but also sharing fate. In view of the enthusiasm of your discussions and the sincerity of your discussions, I would like to offer some frank opinions to you today.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the relationship between constitutional government and political tutelage, it has been discussed in detail on the scene yesterday. Under the common belief in the highest principle of nation-building, the Three People's Principles, we sincerely discussed and said everything. This is a very good phenomenon. My personal opinion is that promoting constitutional government and implementing political tutelage (to be continued). (24th dispatch)</p>

<p>Following the Abe Cabinet, which was in power after Hiranuma, the Abe Cabinet's debut came at a time when Japan had been tragically abandoned by the Nazis and its international position was completely isolated. Therefore, the Abe Cabinet's declared general policy, in addition to preparing to resolve the China Incident with all its strength, was primarily aimed at breaking the diplomatic deadlock. However, for the past four months, despite Abe and his cabinet members constantly comforting their anxious and disappointed people with optimistic tones, the fact is that not only has there been no improvement in foreign relations, but even the fundamental diplomatic foundation of the entire government is still shifting and wavering. No wonder the military has gradually become impatient and suspects the current cabinet's ability to resolve the China Incident and adjust the complex disputes with third countries. The general public is also in a state of bewilderment, awaiting clarification of the government's foreign policy.</p>
<p>The 75th session of the Japanese Diet has convened. This is Japan's political season, and also a current hurdle for the current cabinet. Based on its unique constitution, the Japanese Diet has never had the same effectiveness as the legislative bodies of constitutional countries from the beginning. Its power to guide and control the government is already extremely weak, and even the only major power to pass the budget is subject to significant restrictions. After the "May 15 Incident," politics deviated from the norm, and the Diet's function was further reduced to what Ms. Utley said was equivalent to a rubber stamp. The 73rd and 74th sessions of the Diet, which were convened during the Sino-Japanese War, also had some routine questions and debates, but the passage of budgets and military spending was easier than in previous sessions, and no one dared to criticize the military's aggressive policy. As for this session of the Diet, it will not have any fundamental achievements, but considering the difficult situation of the current Japanese government, the lack of solutions for domestic and foreign affairs, and the plight of the war of aggression against China, all of which are far more serious than before, the debates in this session of the Diet will undoubtedly be more激昂 vehement and heated than in the past, and the government will inevitably be unable to circumvent or conceal its own weaknesses. In the past three or four days, the Diet has been handling routine matters, and will have to adjourn for the New Year. Major debates on national affairs will probably be delayed until mid-to-late January, which is also the period when the US-Japan Treaty and the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty are about to expire and become invalid. In these twenty-odd days, if the various operations of Abe and his colleagues fail to achieve tangible results, then under the agitation of various internal and external situations, the recurrence of the Japanese political turmoil is feared to be unavoidable. The sudden and active appearance of the Minsei and Seiyūkai political parties is a noteworthy event. Even Abe himself has repeatedly broken precedent to invite the leaders of various parties to ask for cooperation. This cannot be immediately recognized as having the meaning of a revival of party politics, but it also shows that the Japanese political situation is in an undercurrent of recession, thus giving the political parties some opportunistic chances to be active.</p>
<p>These situations and difficulties have of course been imagined by Abe and his cabinet members, so for more than a month, they have almost exhausted their efforts to conduct various foreign talks and contacts, hoping to achieve some gains in diplomacy to ease the internal crisis. On the one hand, in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Nomura and others held talks with the ambassadors of the great powers to Japan. On the other hand, Ambassador Horinouchi to the United States, Ambassador Shigemitsu to the United Kingdom, Ambassador Tōgō to the Soviet Union, and Ambassador Sawada, who has just taken office in France, engaged in negotiations with the diplomatic authorities of various countries in Washington, London, Moscow, and Paris. At the same time, in view of the strong attitude of the United States toward Japan, and the slim hope of renewing the commercial treaty, it hastily announced its readiness to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and continued to declare through the navy that it would try to realize this within two months, in order to reduce international suspicion and distrust. Its anxious situation fully illustrates the eagerness of the Japanese government to achieve tangible results in easing international resentment before the Diet meets. Therefore, it also pleaded with the zaibatsu to temporarily endure inconvenience and temporarily sacrifice some of their interests.</p>
<p>In the past one or two days, various optimistic airs have been constantly transmitted from Tokyo, and it is said that the stock market has also seen vitality. But in fact, the most that Japan has gained is that the United States is not prepared to adopt economic punishment measures against Japan for the time being, and that the decade-long gold loan case between Japan and France has been substantially resolved. These are all gains on the negative side, and cannot be said to have any concrete improvement in Japan's current international position and diplomatic relations. However, the Japanese government has greatly exaggerated and praised its optimism. Undoubtedly, these types of events are stimulants, used to cope with the Diet's difficulties and ease various grievances among the people. Japan's current difficulties are all the inevitable result of its aggressive actions against China. How can it be saved by simply improving diplomatic relations with various countries? To go a step further, even if Abe and Nomura can truly achieve their wishes and obtain the conclusion of the US-Japan, Soviet-Japan, and French-Japan commercial treaties, as well as the Soviet-Japanese fisheries treaty, it is a big question how much benefit this will have for the current situation in Japan, let alone that it is only Japan's unilateral wish. What Japan can offer to various countries today is, at most, to use the sharing of looted gains as bait. But judging by common sense, the leaders of the great powers will not be so short-sighted, and for the sake of coveting some short-term gains, they will put everything aside and indirectly support the Japanese factional regime, which is shaking in danger, so that it can continue to invade China and make the world further away from stability and peace. Therefore, the optimism of the current Japanese government itself is not worthy of much attention. Even if the Abe Cabinet is temporarily spared from danger, if its major attempts to resolve the China Incident and open the diplomatic deadlock do not fundamentally abandon the idea of invading China and the so-called "New Order," it will ultimately prove to be a futile effort and have no effect at all.</p>

<p>The Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Instructions</p>
<p>The original text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is as follows: "The Society is gathering together, gathering experts from all over the country in one hall, reviewing the facts of the progress of our engineering circles since the War of Resistance, and studying and solving the practical problems experienced firsthand in wartime service. I believe that there will be many valuable gains to comfort the expectations of the whole country. Our country, as a country with backward industry, is engaged in a comprehensive and protracted war of resistance. To win against strong enemies, we must rely on the united mobilization of our national technical talents to do their best. As far as post-war nation-building is concerned, whether our country can leap forward to become a modern country is largely the responsibility of the engineering circles. In the past, the Premier's grand vision of catching up with science, restoring inherent knowledge, and creating an industrial plan was the basis for realizing the Three People's Principles. Now, when the country is urgently reinvigorated, it is an opportunity for our engineering circles to rise up and devote themselves to serving the country. I deeply hope that your society will advocate the new atmosphere of serving the country with technology, inspire the enthusiasm of our national engineering scholars, concentrate the strength of our national engineering scholars, and guide people to do things and treat things with a spirit of quick and practical work, and engage in creation and cultivation. Many of your members are teaching in schools or serving in careers. Although their efforts are different, their responsibilities are the same. It should be known that the rise of emerging countries in modern times has been caused by technical talents cutting through thorns in extreme hardship. If pure technology is combined with ardent patriotism, then any difficulties can be overcome, and the revolutionary cause will surely succeed. Overcoming the wartime difficulties of material and financial resources, and seeking the most economical and effective construction methods; how to train a large number of mid-level technical cadres to guide young people on the road of serving the country in practice; how to improve the management of enterprises to save consumption and increase efficiency; how to communicate between the technical and administrative aspects to make flexible use; how to promote skilled workers in the work they are responsible for, love and care for workers, and show sympathy for the laboring compatriots who are serving in the military; and even how to guide the national engineering personnel to establish the same national belief, so that they can enthusiastically devote themselves to the construction of the Three People's Principles country, are all things that your society should pay close attention to in addition to discussing academics and reading papers. Strive together to meet the great achievements of a thousand years, and I have high hopes for your society." (23rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing - According to reliable sources today, France recently advised China to negotiate peace with Japan as soon as possible. However, France is not willing to act as a mediator. When France made this proposal, the Chinese government immediately and sternly rejected it. The reason is that the only condition for a ceasefire and peace negotiation between China and Japan is the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China. The peace that China is willing to accept is a peace of honor. According to the same source, France is paying close attention to the battle of Nanning. It believes that after the Japanese army occupied Nanning, it has obtained a land stronghold for attacking Annam. At present, the French army stationed in Annam has only 50,000 troops, which cannot effectively defend the border area of Annam, and it is even more difficult to resist the Japanese attack from the sea, air, and land. Therefore, the internal situation is extremely anxious. However, France believes that after the cessation of the Sino-Japanese War, Annam can be spared this threat.

<p>Chongqing - A senior Chinese official told a United Press reporter last night that the British government is planning to resolve the Tianjin silver issue, roughly allocating a portion of the silver to be managed by an international committee, and another portion to be kept by a neutral country's bank. Representatives from both Britain and Japan will participate in the international committee. He said that Britain is seeking a solution to the silver issue and is seriously considering dividing the silver into two parts. The silver handed over to the international committee will be used to relieve flood victims in North China. The official stated, "We naturally oppose both plans, because both affect Chinese sovereignty. Silver is 'completely Chinese property, and China legally retains full rights to manage and use it.'" China does not intend to consider this plan. China has its own funds to be used for disaster relief, and London has assured China that the silver in Tianjin will never be handed over to the Japanese.

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday the appointment of Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican, to cooperate with the Catholic Church "in parallel efforts for peace." The President stated that the appointment "should not be seen as the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Vatican." The appointment announced by the President yesterday is part of a new program of his efforts to restore peace and aid victims in conjunction with people of all faiths. The President sent similar letters to Pope Pius XII, Mr. Butler, head of the Christian Evangelical Church of America, and Rabbi Adler of American Judaism, requesting their cooperation to achieve his broad goals through religious faith. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt has appointed Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican. Taylor is the chairman of US Steel Corporation and is currently a leading member of the International Committee for Disaster Relief. He will go to the Vatican with the informal title of ambassador. The White House emphatically stated that this move does not restore the diplomatic mission of the US government to the Vatican, which ended in 1870. When appointing his personal representative, President Luo also sent a long telegram to the Pope in Rome, stating: "Now, on Christmas, at a time when worries envelop the world like a dark age, it is especially appropriate to send a telegram to pay tribute. Politicians are now considering the new order of the world, and he is convinced that the new order will eventually be established. He believes that even on this day, billions of people are quietly engaged in building this new order, and although their voices have not been heard, their common faith will eventually shape the history of our era. He now wishes to send his personal representative to the Vatican to assist each other in seeking peace and reducing suffering. In the future, when there is an opportunity to establish world peace on a more stable foundation, common ideas should be consistent. This is extremely important. He hopes that all churches that believe in the same God will devote all their strength to this great task." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>The Pope Responds with a Telegram Expressing Gratitude, Sternly Condemning Violent Policies</p>
<p>Vatican City - US President Roosevelt telegraphed Pope Pius XII, saying that he intended to send Taylor (Chairman of the International Relief Committee for Exiles from Germany and Austria) as a personal representative to the Vatican to cooperate in promoting peace and reducing suffering. The Pope responded with a telegram expressing his gratitude. He then addressed the matter when he received the Cardinals for Christmas greetings (note that the Cardinals pay their respects to the Pope every year on Christmas), and gave a speech clearly mentioning the current war in Europe and elucidating its possible impact on the economy and society. The main points of the speech are as follows. The Pope condemned violent policies, with particular emphasis on the Soviet invasion of Finland.</p>
<p>He stated, "We have unfortunately witnessed various actions that conflict with the provisions of international law, the principles of natural law, and the most basic humanitarianism, proving that the concept of law has been obscured by the purely omnipotent concept. There is a country that, under the pretext of being threatened, deliberately inflicts aggressive actions on a small nation that is diligent and peace-loving. In fact, the so-called threat not only never existed, but was impossible. This kind of aggression should be listed among the aforementioned actions. It abuses destructive tools and inflicts all kinds of atrocities on women, children, and the elderly, disregarding life and trampling on freedom and rights, and will surely be condemned by heaven in the future." I have made efforts for peace, but have not achieved anything due to the mutual suspicion of various nations. Every time I think of the possible impact of the current war on the spiritual, material, economic, and social aspects, it is chilling.</p>
<p>"The rulers of all countries bear the responsibility for the fate of their nations, and should also consider the goals and consequences of the war based on this concept, and determine the basic points for a fair and honorable peace at the appropriate time. If there is an opportunity for negotiation, do not reject it outright."</p>
<h3 id="e19">Basic Conditions for Honorable Peace <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>As for establishing a fair peace, the following principles can serve as an outline: (1) All countries in the world, regardless of size or strength, should have the right to exist and be independent. This is the basic condition for a fair and honorable peace, but no country should condemn another to death simply because it has a desire to exist. (2) In order for the international order established based on the above conditions to be lasting, the heavy burden constituted by the arms race and the crisis of using material power to destroy justice must be eliminated. Indeed, gradual spiritual and practical disarmament that can be accepted by all countries is of utmost importance. Any peace proposal that does not take this into account cannot be lasting. (3) Regarding the reorganization of international life, all participating countries should be aware of the shortcomings of the past and reform international organizations based on the experience gained. In order for countries to accept peace treaties based on a sense of honor, without unilaterally interpreting them arbitrarily, it is essential to establish legal institutions to protect various treaties and ensure their faithful implementation. (4) With regard to Europe, in order to establish a better organization, the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, nationalities, and minorities must be taken into account. Even if these demands conflict with existing treaties and are not sufficient to constitute strict laws, they should be considered in good faith and satisfied in a peaceful manner. When necessary, existing treaties should be revised in a fair and wise manner. (5) If nations and their leaders cannot take into account the status of mankind at all times based on a sense of responsibility and the simple and unshakeable principles that are in accordance with natural law, then any good solution cannot be said to be perfect. All these five points must be kept firmly in mind. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - The economic agreement between Yugoslavia and France was initialed yesterday and will take effect on January 1, 1940. According to this agreement, France will purchase large quantities of meat, timber, tobacco, mineral sand, and ramie from Yugoslavia. According to estimates by the local political newspaper, the annual amount will reach 100 million dinars (the Yugoslav currency, totaling about 3.6 million pounds). Most of this amount will be deducted by France to repay Yugoslavia's debt principal and interest, so that Yugoslavia does not have to remit cash. In addition, France's exports to Yugoslavia will remain at the same level as before the outbreak of the war. France was originally a producing country, but after the outbreak of the war, it has transformed into a consumer country. The economic agreement it has concluded with Yugoslavia is to adapt to this new situation. In addition, Yugoslavia is also conducting economic negotiations with Britain, and an agreement has also been reached in principle. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

The main points were that Sweden will strive for peace, and the Swedish people are eager for peace.

Norway, Denmark, and Sweden have all adopted this precautionary policy. Gu Sri mentioned the relationship between Germany and Sweden, and solemnly reiterated the Swedish government's desire to maintain friendly relations with Germany. Sweden's policy is based on strict neutrality, which the belligerent countries such as Germany will surely agree with, because Germany does not want Sweden to be drawn into the war.

<p>Washington - The twenty-one American countries issued a declaration of neutrality, the main points of which are that the governments of the American countries have received official notification that on the 13th of this month, a British warship and the German warship Admiral Spee fought on the northeastern coast of Uruguay, and there is also a notification that British warships detained or sank German merchant ships such as Dusseldorf and Usukumo in American territorial waters.

Now, according to the above-mentioned declaration, and in order to prevent the recurrence of the situation claimed in the aforementioned notification, the American countries have decided to protest to the belligerent countries, and will negotiate to pass various rules that can strengthen the joint defense system, such as any ship that has engaged in belligerent actions in the American safety zone will not be allowed to repair ships or purchase any supplies needed in American seaports.

With the issuance of this order, they can still spend the holiday in hotels, and they can have fun day and night. The only fly in the ointment is that the military authorities have not extended the operating hours of public transportation. All buses, trams, subways, etc., must still stop operating at 8:30 p.m. The general public still cannot fully enjoy going out at night. If they do not return early, they must walk home no matter how far away they are. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - During this time of war, Germany is still celebrating Christmas as usual. It is celebrating for three days from today. Christmas trees and other seasonal scenes are everywhere. Churches are holding Christmas services. The Christmas after the war is truly the same as before. The lively scenes are no different from in previous years. However, Berlin is still implementing a blackout on Christmas night. Today, all stores are still open for business. Customers are all going to buy daily necessities, because all businesses will be closed for the next two days. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Today, tens of thousands of German soldiers returned from the front line to spend Christmas. Countless women and children were waiting at the station. Although the train opened special trains and increased the number of trains, the congestion was unprecedented in previous years. Christmas gifts and packages sent to the front line were piled up like mountains. All the major stores, even restaurants and newspaper offices, in the city were closed, so that all employees could celebrate Christmas at home with their families. (Haitong dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">US Unwilling to Renew Trade Agreement Before Far East Disputes are Resolved, Talks Underway in Tokyo and Washington, US Officials Explain US Attitude <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and US Ambassador Grew are actively engaged in talks in Tokyo. On the other hand, Japanese Ambassador to the US Horinouchi also met with Secretary of State Hull for a long time today, extending on some points in the Tokyo talks. This matter was commented on by well-informed sources: According to the current US tariff law, there are only two import tariff rates, one is the general tariff, which applies to all countries regardless of whether they have a trade agreement with the US, and the other is the retaliatory tariff, which applies to countries that discriminate against the US. So far, only German goods are subject to retaliatory tariffs. In addition, the current US navigation law contains a clause stipulating that various goods transported to the US by ships from countries that do not have a trade agreement with the US shall pay an additional tax of 10%. However, former President Grant issued an order in 1872 stipulating that this clause does not apply to Japan. This order is still valid. Therefore, after the US-Japan trade agreement expires on January 25, 1740, Japanese goods imported into the US can still be subject to the general tariff. However, if the US government wants to impose various restrictions on Japanese imported goods, it is possible for Congress to enact laws. Japanese newspapers reported that US Ambassador to Japan Grew assured Foreign Minister Nomura that the US would still maintain trade relations with Japan. This must be transferred depending on the attitude of Congress towards Japan, and the diplomatic attitude of Congress often only follows the lead of the State Department. However, the points that Ambassador Grew told Foreign Minister Nomura have caused a good response in Japan. This is very satisfying to the State Department, and it is said that the Japanese government is now working hard to get closer to the US, which is commendable. However, responsible officials all said that Japan has repeatedly violated its promises to China, and has repeatedly obstructed the interests of foreign countries in China. The disputes between Japan and the US have arisen from this. Regarding these disputes, the US attitude is still extremely firm and has not changed slightly. If Japan wants to conclude a new trade agreement with the US or negotiate temporary measures, it must first resolve the various issues in the Far East so that the US government can be satisfied. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Newspapers here today praised the US's measure to stop levying discriminatory tariffs on Japan, but solemnly stated that this step cannot be a permanent adjustment of US-Japan relations. "Nikkei Shimbun" praised US Ambassador to Japan Grew and claimed that "the fair response of the US has removed the barriers obstructing US-Japan relations, but the success of Nomura's diplomacy cannot be guaranteed." "Asahi Shimbun" declared that "it is too early to interpret the US decision as indicating that the US intends to revise the trade agreement." (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Severe Cold in Finland Halts Fighting; Kemi River Valley Returns to Finnish Control; Soviet Strategy Suffers Another Setback <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Copenhagen: According to reports received here, the fighting in northernmost Finland has come to a standstill due to the severe cold. Both sides are only trying to maintain the status quo this winter and are unwilling to advance. North of Salla, the Soviet High Command has deployed only two regiments, a rather weak force. However, the Finnish counterattacks are also weak, so they have been able to maintain the status quo. In short, the Soviet army is unwilling to launch an offensive this winter. Therefore, if any major battle occurs, it will be launched by the Finnish forces. Reports in local newspapers about Soviet defeats in the Salla area are somewhat exaggerated. However, since the Finnish army recaptured Salla-Koski northwest of Salla, it has regained control of the Kemi River Valley. The Kemi River and Kemi Lake are natural barriers in eastern Finland, extending for 400 kilometers, making it the most advantageous terrain for Finnish defense. Currently, the Finnish army is trying to strengthen its control in this area to prevent a Soviet breakthrough. It is reported that the Soviet army has already sacrificed 2,000 men in attacking this area. However, with a force of 10,000 in this area, the Soviets still have plenty of reserves, and a more violent offensive is expected soon. However, if the Soviet offensive is not to fail and is to achieve its plan of cutting Finland into two, it must protect its flanks and the security of the Murmansk Railway. To date, Finnish guerrillas are constantly threatening the Soviet lines of communication in their rear. Furthermore, news from the Swedish capital claims that due to Soviet failures in northernmost Finland, the Finnish army has captured 5,000 Soviet soldiers. Unconfirmed reports state that since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, Soviet losses have been heavy, with 25,000 killed, 39,000 wounded and missing. According to Soviet deserters, numerous Red Army officers have been executed since the failure of the Soviet offensive. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a communique issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, "There were no major developments on the front lines on the 22nd and 23rd. The air force was very active in certain locations. A total of 16 enemy aircraft were shot down in the last two days." (TASS dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: A communique issued here today stated that after fierce fighting, the Finnish army has recaptured the entire Salajärvi area. The Soviet army resisted fiercely in this battle, but suffered heavy casualties and eventually collapsed. Some surrendered. Finnish forces in the area are continuing to advance. It is reported that the captured war materiel includes six artillery pieces, eight tanks, and eight anti-tank guns. In the battles of Tolvajärvi and Aglajärvi, the Finnish army captured over 600 prisoners and killed 2,000 enemy soldiers. Finnish forces in the Salla area are currently continuing to advance.

<p>London: According to a new cabinet order published here yesterday, any resident transferring pounds or pound securities to a non-resident must obtain approval from the Treasury. Non-residents refer to those residing outside the United Kingdom, its Dominions, British territories, British protectorates, British mandate territories (except Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong), Egypt, Sudan, and Iraq. This order supplements the 1939 Defense Regulations concerning finance and will take effect on January 8. However, non-resident pound accounts remain free and unaffected. The order includes an exception: income received by non-residents from the sale or liquidation of their pound securities, or dividends or bonuses on securities registered in their own name or the name of their nominee, or interest on bearer securities collected by a custodian bank, may be credited to the non-resident's account without any formalities.

<h3 id="e33">Dutch Aircraft Manufacturer Fokker Dies <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>New York: Famous aircraft designer Mr. Fokker passed away here at the age of 49. Fokker was born in Java and returned to the Netherlands with his parents at the age of four. He displayed a talent for aircraft manufacturing from a young age. At the age of 21, he made his first flight in an aircraft he built himself. Germany admired his talent and persuaded him to go to Germany to found an aircraft factory. In 1913, the factory flourished. The following year, when the European War broke out, the factory received a large number of orders from the German government and undertook the training of aviators. The most famous of his aircraft was the Fokker D.VIII fighter. By the end of the war, Germany had handed over no fewer than 1,500 of these aircraft. After the war, Fokker moved his factory to Amsterdam and established the Dutch Aircraft Manufacturing Company. In 1922, a Fokker aircraft flew from east to west in the United States, achieving remarkable results. Fokker then went to the United States and founded the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation. In 1926, he built the first three-engine aircraft, and the test flight results were excellent. Admiral Byrd, the leader of the Arctic expedition, immediately purchased it for his expedition. Fokker aircraft became increasingly renowned, and no fewer than 25 airlines in Europe and elsewhere used his aircraft, and 19 airlines in the Americas used them as well. The Atlantic Aircraft Corporation was later renamed the General Aviation Corporation, and Fokker served as the director of the mechanical department until he retired in 1931.

<p>London: The British Admiralty announced yesterday the procedure for laying mines in retaliation for German mine warfare and to "better protect ships sailing in the North Sea." The Admiralty communique stated that it will no longer issue notices when laying mines in designated areas because "Germany is laying automatic anchored mines without notice in the North Sea outside British territorial waters." Therefore, the Admiralty announces its intention to lay mines to protect ships sailing in the North Sea off the east coast of England and Scotland. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Oslo: The Swedish ship "Mars," carrying a shipment of coal, was sailing from that country to England when it struck a mine and sank in the [blank space in original] Sea on the morning of the 21st of this month. Another Swedish ship, the "Garhäll," arrived shortly thereafter to rescue the crew of the "Mars." Unexpectedly, it also struck a mine. As there was not enough time to lower the lifeboats, the crew members who fell into the sea drifted away with the waves. A Norwegian ship arrived and rescued one crew member from the "Mars" and seven crew members from the "Garhäll." The other 28 crew members from each ship are missing. The Norwegian ship has arrived at Kristiansand in this country, and the eight rescued crew members have landed. Two of them have been taken to the hospital for treatment due to serious injuries.

<h3 id="e38">Britain and France Will Not Stand Idly By If Sweden and Norway Are Attacked; Two Methods of Assisting Finland Have Been Drawn Up; Negotiations Will Be Held with Nordic Countries <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that in the coming days, the British and French governments will be most concerned with the issue of assisting Finland and will therefore hold negotiations with the Scandinavian countries. According to statements made by French Prime Minister Daladier and certain British cabinet members, the joint meeting of the British and French Supreme Defense Committees recently discussed two methods of assistance. One is direct assistance, that is, the direct shipment of military supplies to Finland. It is expected that Britain and France will supply the country with hundreds of aircraft, as well as a large number of rifles, machine guns, field artillery, anti-aircraft guns, war defense guns, and gas masks in the short term. At the same time, according to news from Rome, Italy will likely not remain inactive. If Berlin still refuses to allow Italian arms shipments destined for Finland to pass through Germany, they will inevitably be shipped by sea to Sweden and Norway, and then transshipped to Finland. Some even believe that the Italian government will allow a batch of volunteers to go to Finland to serve in the army. The second is indirect assistance, which will be broader than direct assistance. That is, it is hoped that the Scandinavian countries can assist Finland's resistance to the greatest extent possible. However, there is a great risk if these countries participate in the Soviet-Finnish war. Therefore, if these countries are attacked by the Soviet Union or Germany because of their assistance to Finland, how Britain and France should protect them should also be considered. As far as Germany is concerned, it has long coveted Sweden's iron ore. If it does not receive a sufficient supply of ore in the future, it will become increasingly difficult to fight against Britain and France. Therefore, it is expected that the country will take advantage of any pretext to seize this iron ore. Regarding this, it is heard that if the Scandinavian countries are attacked for assisting Finland, Britain and France will not stand idly by. If Germany occupies Sweden or controls it economically, Norway's situation will also be precarious. The situation is extremely serious. Furthermore, Norway's west coast has significant strategic value. If it also falls into the hands of the enemy in the future, Britain and France's overseas trade and even naval activities will be threatened. Therefore, for these reasons, Britain and France are conducting talks with the Scandinavian countries and will certainly try to reassure them, so that they will earnestly assist Finland's resistance without fear of future troubles.

<h3 id="e41">The Post-Fall of Nanning Situation; The Japanese Army's Edge in the Battle of Batang Has Been Greatly Blunted; The Lines of Yongbin and Yongwu Have Become Stalemate <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Guilin airmail, after the Chinese army's victory in Northern Hunan, the Japanese forces are increasingly exhausted. Although they have had a short period of rest and replenishment, they have not reached the capacity to launch a large-scale new offensive. However, the Japanese army finally made one last risky attempt, landing along the Qin-Fang coast on November 16 and invading the border of Guangxi. The following is a record of the fighting in that area:</p>
<p>Last winter, when Beihai was under pressure, the Chinese army once gathered on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, preparing to confront the invaders head-on. Later, the situation changed, and there was no need to control the southern route with heavy troops, so some were transferred elsewhere. According to the observations of Chinese and foreign military observers, the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties in the fighting over the past two years, and its forces are already insufficient. If it wants to invade Guangxi, it must have at least five divisions or more. Before the Battle of Changsha, the Japanese army could not draw and concentrate so many troops. Moreover, the Battle of Northern Hunan depleted its vitality, making it extremely difficult to launch a new offensive. However, it disregarded everything and took the risk of invading Guangxi. It is said that the guide for this was Huang Mingtang. Huang was originally from Guangdong, and the Shiwan Mountains on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi stretch for thousands of miles, with undulating hills and dangerous terrain. Over the years, it has been an area where bandits have emerged. Huang knew this situation well and secretly incited ignorant bandits, who were then used by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army landed at Qisha Longmen Port, it initially did not expect to make any progress. The Qin-Fang coastal area is a famous "vast sea of sand," an indefensible area. However, after landing, they had to pass through the unprotected sandy plains, which was a good terrain for the Chinese army to unleash its firepower. Unexpectedly, the bandits guided them, and the defending army was trapped and unable to display its power. As a result, Qin-Fang was lost, and the Japanese army gained a foothold. One side sent troops north, while the other side continuously reinforced them, infiltrating through secret routes, heading towards Xiaodong Datang, crossing the Yu River secretly, and detouring to Santang and Sitang on the Yongbin Road. As a result, Nanning could not be defended.</p>
<p>The fall of Nanning occurred at 2 p.m. on November 24. Its vanguard was actually a bandit force from the Shiwan Mountains. The defending army resisted heroically, and after a fierce battle, they withdrew. Nanning was originally a key hub for southwest transportation, but all manpower and materials had been evacuated in advance, making it an empty city. When Nanning was under pressure, the Chinese army moved south in large numbers. Wei, Li, Su, He, Dai and other units were ordered to rush to block them. The vanguard of Dai's unit was Shao Yizhi's regiment, which arrived near Nanning at 2 p.m. on the 24th. By that time, Nanning had fallen, so they stopped at Ertang, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Unexpectedly, at this time, the Japanese army, guided by the bandits, sneaked into the Santang and Wutang area. While Shao's regiment was on the march, they suddenly encountered Japanese cavalry. After determining that they were the Japanese army's outpost, they quickly dispersed on the spot to intercept them, thus unfolding a fierce battle. At that time, Shao's regiment's situation was quite unfavorable, as they were attacked from both the front and the rear. Fortunately, the soldiers of his unit were well-trained and did not panic when faced with the change, so they were able to confront the Japanese army, fighting while setting up defenses. On that day, dozens of Japanese aircraft took turns bombing and strafing the regiment's position. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers attacked more than ten times. The officers and soldiers of the regiment resisted calmly, annihilating each wave of attacking Japanese soldiers in front of the position. The presence of Japanese aircraft did not have an effect. Within a day, 600-700 Japanese soldiers were killed. That night, the Japanese army significantly reinforced their forces. The next day (November 25) at dawn, they launched a massive assault on the Chinese army's position. The battle was extremely fierce, but they were gradually repelled by the Chinese army. Although the Chinese army suffered many casualties, the Japanese army's casualties were at least three times those of the Chinese army. Soon, the Japanese army launched a smokescreen and a general offensive across the entire line, but they still failed to achieve their goal. Throughout the two-day battle, the Chinese army never gave up an inch of territory. A certain rifleman in the unit was extremely accurate in his shooting, killing six Japanese machine gunners on that day, eventually forcing them to shift their position, which is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>The next day at dawn, the regiment was ordered to break through the encirclement. Regiment Commander Shao Yizhi personally led two companies to charge. In an instant, they captured two hilltops. Shao then used binoculars to observe the enemy situation on the high ground. Unfortunately, a bullet flew over and struck a vital spot, causing him to sacrifice heroically. The regiment's deputy commander Wu Qisheng saw the regimental commander fall and immediately led his unit to rescue him. Unfortunately, he was also shot by Japanese machine guns. Deputy Regiment Commander Wen Mo heard the news and rushed to continue the command, ensuring that morale did not fall. Soon, Deputy Regiment Commander Wen was also hit by shrapnel from a Japanese artillery shell, suffering four wounds on his back. However, he finally bravely commanded, repelling the Japanese army. In total, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, the unit killed and wounded as many as 900 Japanese soldiers. The regiment's losses also reached 300-400, showing how intense the battle was. After the fall of Nanning, the two armies' positions were stalemated on the Yongwu Road at the Great and Small Gaofeng Ridge, and on the Yongbin Road between the Seventh and Eighth Pond. Both places have undulating hills and dangerous terrain, leading to fierce battles for control, particularly near the Eighth Pond. At that time, the Japanese army, riding the momentum of a small victory, approached the Chinese army. If the Eighth Pond could not be defended, Binyang would be in danger. Therefore, the Battle of Batang was of great importance to the security of the southern front.</p>
<p>At that time, Dai's division Gao's regiment arrived one after another and were ordered to defend the area in haste. Regiment Commander Gao was the battalion commander when Guan Linzheng served as division commander. He had fought heroically at the Great Wall in the past, annihilating countless enemies. During the defense of Wuhan, he served as the regimental commander of Du's division, and his isolated defense during the Battle of Wujiazhuang repeatedly chilled the enemy's courage. Later, he was transferred to Dai's division. After receiving the order this time, at dawn, after the deployments were completed, the order to attack was given. All the soldiers wore light clothing and moved out of the trenches, crawling forward. When they approached the Japanese army, shouts of killing rang out, the sound of hand grenades echoed, and bayonets danced, rushing into the Japanese formation in a storm of rain and wind. The Japanese soldiers relied on aircraft and artillery in combat, but when faced with the Chinese army's bayonet charges, they often fled in fear. At this time, the Japanese army was caught off guard and panicked. After a brief engagement, they collapsed, with several hundred killed by Chinese soldiers' bayonets and bullets. Corpses filled the trenches, and blood filled the ditches. Batang was immediately recaptured. The Chinese soldiers, encouraged by their victory, pursued with all their might, halting at the Seventh Pond due to a broken bridge. The results of this battle were significant, and the casualties among the Chinese soldiers were less than half those of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, for the first time, dared not underestimate the Chinese and dared not invade again. The stabilization of the Guangxi-South front was no small feat.</p>
<p>After the southern front was stabilized, the Yongbin and Yongwu lines became stalemated. The Yongwu Road faced each other at the Gaofeng Ridge area, while the Yongbin Road used the Kunlun Pass as a barrier, with the vanguard still near the Eighth Pond. The Japanese army, with insufficient troops, had previously relied on the help of bandits, but now it could not use the same tricks again. In addition, the Chinese army carried out powerful attacks from time to time, and the guerrillas were active on the south bank of the Yu River and on both sides of the Yong-Qin Road. The Japanese army often felt threatened, and the destruction of the highway made reinforcement even more difficult. Therefore, they were at a loss for what to do. The Chinese side was digging deep trenches and building strong fortifications to prevent the Japanese army from fleeing north, while actively preparing to annihilate the Japanese army at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>Chongqing Correspondence, the fifth of this month was the anniversary of the revolt of the Zhaohua warship. Yang Hu, a central commissioner who presided over the event, recently made a speech saying, "The central government is now jointly commemorating the Zhaohua revolt and the Yunnan uprising. The two commemorations have the same meaning and are causally related. In terms of revolutionary means and meaning, they are inseparable, so they are held together. Today's situation is more tense than it was then. At that time, it was Chinese against Chinese, but now a powerful enemy is pressing in, and we are facing a great disaster. We should use ten times the spirit of the "Zhaohua" and "Yunnan" revolutions to deal with the current environment. We are looking forward to the greatest national memorial day in the near future. As long as we work hard and do practical work, success is only a matter of time. I am a revolutionary soldier, and there is no word "difficult" in the dictionary of a revolutionary. When the central government first raised the slogan of "final victory", the people of the country were afraid of difficulties and thought that it would be difficult to achieve, or that it would take a long time. Now there are facts to show us that victory is getting closer and closer. The facts are like this, so no matter what, we cannot shake our belief in the war of resistance and hinder our path to victory." He also said, "I regard Shanghai as my second hometown. I have a harmonious relationship with the elders and brothers in Shanghai. Although we are in different places, I am still very concerned. I read Shanghai newspapers every day and I deeply understand that the citizens of Shanghai are suffering in a painful environment, and I greatly admire them for upholding justice. I sincerely hope that the people of Shanghai will continue this unwavering determination and not lose heart, and strive for future glory."</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts of Shanghai City, under the guidance of the Boy Scouts Council after August 13, participated in battlefield service work and made great contributions. Since the Chinese army moved west, more than 300 Boy Scouts have continued to work in the interior, and have established the First Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service, led by Leng Xueqiao. Now an office has been established in Chongqing, a mobile regimental headquarters has been organized, and work has begun. The following is a communication from Leng, the regimental leader, to the Boy Scout community in this city, describing the current situation of the regiment:</p>
<p>Past Service Conditions</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13 War, more than 3,000 Boy Scouts in this city have participated in battlefield service, and their achievements have been known to the people of Shanghai. After the fall of Shanghai, more than 300 male and female members were distributed in the battlefield to continue serving, such as the crossing outside Nanjing, the breakout from Xuzhou, the flood in Kaifeng, the retreat from Mahui Ridge, the destruction of Wuhan, the fall of Guangzhou, and the great fire in Xiangyuan, all of which had Boy Scouts from this city participating in service. In the rear, personnel were also sent to Gansu and Shaanxi to serve in rural areas. Last year's December 25th Grand Parade in Chongqing and the protective work during the air raid in Guilin were all commended by the government.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Recent Work</p>
<p>In the past, the members were scattered in various battlefields, relying entirely on communication to connect. Now, in order to achieve closer contact, a delegation from the Shanghai Boy Scout Council has been established as the command mechanism, and a resident office has been organized at No. 3 Zaliang Street, Chongqing, to facilitate closer access to the Ministry of Education and the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts. The First Regiment under its jurisdiction is in Chongqing and Guilin, and the First Branch Regiment recently moved from Changsha to Qiyang and will go to Guiyang. There are also several directly subordinate teams, one in the Ningguo and Yicheng areas of Anhui, engaged in political training work, one in northern Guangdong engaged in medical rescue work, one in Jiangxi engaged in propaganda work, and one in Ji'an engaged in rear work.</p>
<p>Organizing Mobile Regimental Headquarters</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the inspection and command of the members' service in various places, the regiment specially sent Deputy Regiment Commander Ni, Department Chief Zheng, and Chief Executive Chen from Chongqing to inspect various places. They are currently actively preparing and will depart within days, and will also organize a mobile regimental headquarters. The first phase of the planned route will pass through the provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. In addition, with the special permission of the Ministry of Education, members entering Sichuan can enroll in school free of charge, and all food and lodging will also be subsidized by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3 id="e44">General Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (13) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, regarding the area of strict criticism, their position is to avoid the majority of young people being deprived of education. They hope that universities can accommodate as many as possible, aiming to cultivate versatile talents to serve the country. Their intention is nothing more than planning for the future of the nation. In this period of simultaneously advancing the War of Resistance and national construction, it would be a misfortune for society to have too many young people out of school. There will be even more need for talent in post-war construction, and it is necessary to plan for this in advance. However, from another perspective, universities are for talent education, and not everyone can or should enter. The purpose of universities is to cultivate specialists, not to provide relief to those deprived of education. If all middle school graduates must be accommodated by universities, then universities would not need entrance examinations at all, and the unified entrance examination would lose its meaning. I have already stated earlier that it is not currently feasible for all middle school graduates to enter universities. In fact, universities cannot accommodate them all, nor is there a need to do so. As a result of last year's unified examination, the Ministry of Education established preparatory classes and various specialized courses to accommodate those who did not pass. The purpose was to both provide relief to young people deprived of education and to cultivate practical technical talents to meet urgent needs. This year, students with weaker results will be admitted to preparatory classes, giving them the opportunity to improve and retake the exam next year. Furthermore, the number of preparatory classes has been expanded from over ten to over twenty. The government's painstaking efforts can be seen here. We can say that the establishment of preparatory classes in the unified examination is to provide relief to those deprived of education while providing them with sufficient training in basic subjects. The admission of university freshmen still maintains the standards of university level. If we compare the number of admissions with the capacity of each school, we can see that this year's admissions are still more than two thousand short of the number required by each school. In terms of departments, except for various departments of engineering colleges and departments such as political science and economics, almost all departments have not admitted the full quota. If we were to lower the standards, it would not be a problem to admit more than two thousand more people this year. It can be seen that the unified examination still maintains its high standard for university level, and for candidates below the standard, preparatory classes are set up to provide relief. As for the three-quarters of students who were not admitted, what methods are there to remedy this? Among the students taking the exam this year, nearly five thousand have equivalent academic qualifications. These students have not yet graduated from middle school and can still return to middle school to study. Some can apply to military schools and other technical schools to meet the urgent needs of the War of Resistance. Some can apply to vocational schools and various specialized courses. If they are determined to enter university for further studies, they can still apply to provincial and private colleges and universities. The number of students these schools are approved by the Ministry of Education to enroll is about five thousand. Students also have plenty of opportunities to retake the exam. Therefore, students who were not admitted to this year's unified examination will not necessarily be deprived of education.</p>
<p>(2) Disparity in the Number of Arts and Sciences: The disparity between the number of students admitted in arts and science subjects in the unified examination is also a common criticism. The ratio of students admitted in arts and science subjects in the past two years is listed below:</p>
<p>(A) In 1938, there were 2,942 students in science-related subjects (including agriculture, engineering, and medicine), accounting for 53.9% of the total. There were 1,427 students in arts-related subjects (including literature, law, and commerce), accounting for 26.2%. There were 1,091 students in teacher training, accounting for 19.9%. The total was 5,460 students. (B) In 1939 (excluding Shanghai), there were 2,706 students in science-related subjects, accounting for 59.4%. There were 1,182 students in arts-related subjects, accounting for 26.1%. There were 665 students in teacher training, accounting for 14.5%. The total was 8,503 students.</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, the number of students in science-related subjects is higher, especially in engineering (1,752 students). However, in terms of actual needs, it is not considered many. Therefore, this year, various universities with engineering departments have had to increase the number of classes and expand the enrollment due to too many quotas and the inability of the original classes to accommodate them. The Ministry of Education has added more than ten engineering classes this year as a result of the enrollment. This is to adapt to actual needs.</p>

<h3 id="e48">International Cup Football Preliminary Round: China Defeats Russia Yesterday; Poor Ball Luck in the First Half, Trailing 0-1; Finally Changes Formation and Scores Two Goals in a Row to Win <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The International Cup football tournament, in which eight countries are competing, has entered its second week, including England, Portugal, and Scotland. Yesterday morning, under a hazy sky and biting wind, China and Russia met at the Recreation Ground. The Chinese team, with its strong lineup, expected to easily win against the Russian team, whose football skills were mediocre. However, after the start of the match, the enemy's atmosphere was unexpectedly arrogant. The Chinese team's ball luck was extremely poor, and every time they reached a good position, they ultimately fell short. In the end, they unexpectedly conceded a goal first. Although they fought hard to counterattack, they still found it difficult, causing the four thousand spectators to sigh in disappointment. It was not until the last fifteen minutes that the Chinese team showed improvement after changing its formation. Within ten minutes, they scored two goals in a row, and the final victory ultimately belonged to China. They joined England, Portugal, and Scotland in the second round. The initial lineups of both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Li Yichen, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Wu Qixiang, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Russia</p>
<p>Naisidanwen, Nuogeluofu</p>
<p>Nikolaiev, Kailuo Liequ</p>
<p>Bosaweiqu, Kairu, Laobusi Tuofu</p>
<p>Ha Fuyu Fu, Baoluoning</p>
<p>Guan Lu Fuofu, Kaipusiding</p>
<p>First Goal Conceded</p>
<p>Russia kicked off and attacked first. The five forwards advanced, and the Chinese army was caught off guard, forcing a corner kick. Nuogeluofu kicked it, and Qin Bigao calmly patted it away, leaving the dangerous situation. The Chinese army counterattacked, and the military situation was extremely strong, but there were many good opportunities. Xu Wenkui, received a long pass from Wu Qixiang, and the audience cheered, thinking that it would be a success, but unexpectedly Xu Wenkui kicked the ball high. The Chinese team's poor ball luck reached its peak. Therefore, the Russian general took advantage of this depressed moment and divided his troops to make a surprise attack. Meng Yiliang accidentally lost his footing and was invaded by the yellow hair. Fortunately, with the help of Bigao, the danger was turned into safety. One wave had just calmed down, and another wave rose again. Naisidanwen took advantage of the corner kick that Qin Bigao patted out and made a unexpected surprise attack, but he was too hasty and shot the yellow hair's heel. Naisidanwen's feet were sharp, and he once opened a free kick in the middle of the field, straight to the door of the Chinese team. Bigao received it, but slipped into a corner kick. The Russian army continued to watch and finally, at six minutes, Kepu hit the upper right corner and fell into a city. Although the Chinese team tried hard to counterattack, it was not helpful. Russia took the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>After lemon, the three armies rose up and made a desperate move. However, the ball luck was very bad, and everything was on the left. Akui's feet did not recover, and the shot was either biased or skewed. Nikolaev fouled, and Yichen's very confident 20-yard free kick also skimmed the crossbar and escaped. The two guards of the Russian side were indeed amazing. For more than ten minutes, the five Chinese forwards could not get the ball. It was not until more than twenty minutes later that Sun's captain ordered to change the formation, with Wu Qixiang transferred to the right wing, Akui in charge of the center forward, and Huang Kehou retired to the left midfielder. The situation suddenly took a turn for the better, controlling the overall situation. Although Xu Wenkui missed three shots and Li Yichen missed the wood twice, making the audience regretful, Qin Bigao brought out Baoluoning's dangerous shot, making the momentum even stronger. At thirty minutes, Yichen shot from a distance, and Youliang kicked it high. Wu Qixiang topped it near the door and broke into the door instantly. The Chinese team's voice was strong. The Russian army became angry and their actions became wild. Li Yichen was kicked in the left eye by Kaipusiding, his face was covered with blood, and he retired. Sun Jinshun retreated to the defense, and there were only four forwards left. However, the offensive was not diminished. After nine minutes, Wu Qixiang went deep into the light ride, and the left passed to the center. Akui deliberately used smoke screens, not shooting but picking up, Bosaweiqu was induced out, and Qiuting took advantage of the situation at the door and lightly tapped the right ankle, and the ball entered the net safely. The Chinese team defeated the Russian team in less than ten minutes under absolute depression. In the last six minutes, the Chinese team encountered two dangerous situations, but there was no theft. As a result, the Chinese team defeated Russia 2-1.</p>

Citibank's skills are at a high standard, and both offensive and defensive skills are excellent, and they are the best in the banking sector. Therefore, in each game, the scores were close.

<p>Today is the National Renaissance Festival, and also the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day, and the Zhaohe Uprising Memorial Day, which have also been merged and held as stipulated by the central government. All sectors will enthusiastically celebrate this glorious and great memorial day. All agencies, public groups, schools, etc., have holidays as usual, but there will be no hanging of flags or elaborate celebration ceremonies. Three years ago, in the Xi'an Incident, the leader showed the spirit of "not being careless in the face of adversity" and "not yielding," which is what every citizen should emulate. All sectors are aware that to complete the great cause of resistance and construction and revive the nation, all 400 million people have a responsibility, and they are determined to fulfill their responsibilities under the overall national policy, and to vigorously promote the movement of frugality, saving for national use, and helping refugees. As for the authorities of the two concessions, it is heard that they will temporarily step up security today to prevent it. In addition, all sectors, in order to save waste and get rid of old habits, previously planned to print and sell Renaissance Festival commemorative bookmarks during the Renaissance Festival to replace New Year cards. Now, due to the inability to print them in time, the sale has been stopped. However, a small number have already been printed and will be given away for free.</p>
<p>Educational Groups Send Telegram to Chiang to Pay Respect</p>

The original text reads, "To President Chiang in Chongqing, the war of resistance has been going on for more than two years, thanks to your leadership and decisive command, the Koufen is gradually decreasing, and victory is expected. Today, on the occasion of the National Renaissance Festival, we look forward to your brilliance and are even more inspired. In addition to inspiring teachers and students with your great personality and supporting national policies, we respectfully send our respects." The Shanghai Municipal Education and Culture Group telegram.</p>
<p>A Letter to Compatriots on the Movement of Integrity and Shame</p>
<p>The City's Committee for the Movement of Integrity and Shame is issuing a document to honor our compatriots for the National Renaissance Festival, the Yunnan Uprising Memorial, and the birth of Jesus. The document states: Today is the National Renaissance Festival, the Yunnan Uprising Memorial, and also two important milestones in the history of the Chinese Revolution, because the establishment of the Republic of China is the crystallization of the sacrifices of Sun Yat-sen and the majority of revolutionary martyrs, and it is also the cornerstone of the world's great harmony by implementing the Three Principles of the People. Unfortunately, at that time, due to a few politicians who sought to苟安妥協, and Yuan Shikai's obsession with becoming emperor, the revolutionary cause was interrupted invisibly, and the revolutionary cornerstone was almost destroyed. Fortunately, Cai Songpo, Li Liejun, Tang Jiyao, etc., organized the National Protection Army and launched an uprising in Yunnan, and various provinces responded one after another. The cornerstone was re-laid, otherwise the Republic of China would be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident was formally a display of power and coercion, which did not conform to the great righteousness, but in spirit, it was indeed an inevitable reaction to the overwhelming and intimidating invasion. The President was able to turn danger into safety and return to the capital because of his great national personality and determination to believe in doctrine, and with the support of the people of the whole country. At the same time, this historical transformation has entered a new stage, uniting the entire nation and launching a sacred war of resistance, working hard to strive for China's territorial</p>
<p>Sovereign integrity and independence and freedom, especially on this day, which is the birth of Jesus, Jesus reformed Judaism, because at that time the Jewish people were under the rule of foreign races and were deeply oppressed and exploited by bureaucratic landlords and gentry, using the teachings of religion to develop a great force, unite people's hearts, but in the end, they were not tolerated by the Jews and Roman officials, so they were nailed to the cross, and died for the sins of others, none of the above three facts is not to promote</p>
<p>Human righteousness, a great personality, unyielding, and transforming people's hearts, especially when the integrity and shame are lost, and we encounter this day with three meanings, we feel even more profound meaning. However, what is the lesson we have learned on this day? I think first, in today's day when the victory of the War of Resistance is getting closer and closer, as long as everyone takes on the responsibility of the three major meanings of the Yunnan Uprising, the President's hardship, and Jesus' salvation, and add to it the hard work,</p>
<p>The spirit of advocating integrity and shame, no one will fall for the tricks of others. Second, the Three Principles of the People are the most suitable revolutionary highest principle for the Chinese national character, and it is also the inevitable destination of historical evolution. As long as everyone loves themselves, no violence can stop or destroy it. China's War of Resistance, of course, was decided after the Xi'an Incident, but it also数千年一贯精神 of the four virtues and eight virtues. At the last moment, even without the Xi'an Incident, we had to uphold justice and unite,</p>
<p>Country for self-help, there is of course no shortage of pain and sacrifice in the War of Resistance, but these are temporary phenomena, temporary endurance, and the determination to hold on to 寗爲玉碎, 小爲瓦全 is the price of permanent happiness and glory in the future. Third, Jesus, in view of the suffering Jewish people, without a country, without a leader, did not委曲求全, greedy for life and afraid of death, regardless of everything, rose up to lead, just like the Yunnan Uprising, which made the giants cold, smashed the imperial system, and like the Xi'an Incident, preserved the national righteousness and promoted</p>
<p>The unyielding spirit, in order to create a situation of turmoil and uneasiness in the enemy's country, is the same meaning. We have come to these three meaningful holidays, how can we be silent and not tell our compatriots? All my compatriots, regardless of class or status, must stand firm in their positions, not be lured by profit, not be threatened, to promote the four virtues and eight virtues, benefit Wujiang, the future of Kangjian, is really deeply relied on.</p>

The authorities have strictly set a limit price in order to maintain security, and are not allowed to exceed it. People's hearts can be slightly settled. However, in recent days, due to the scarcity of domestic rice, the market situation has become tense again. We are sincerely afraid that colleagues will need high-quality goods and endure dark plates and buy in excess of the price. It must be known that such behavior will cause hidden pain to themselves, and will also violate the authorities' ban. If discovered, they will be severely punished. For this reason, we earnestly inform our member colleagues that they should absolutely abide by the limit price for import and export sales and purchases, and should not exceed it in the slightest. If there is any violation, we will present it to the authorities for strict investigation and will never be lenient. Please abide by it."</p>

This has become the largest share of domestic goods exports in trade with all countries. Imports of foreign goods have sharply decreased since October due to the government's ban on luxury and non-essential goods, amounting to 99,670,000 yuan in October and 84,009,000 yuan in November. Beginning in November, the overall foreign trade has shifted from a deficit to a surplus, with a surplus of 49,492,000 yuan. Consequently, China's foreign exchange reserves have become increasingly abundant, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai has eased, the value of the legal tender has implicitly increased, and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's fund has been further strengthened. This situation is rare since the start of the war of resistance, and it greatly benefits the domestic goods industry.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Yesterday's Paradise, Today's Hell: The Tragic Life of the People of Hangzhou; The Poor Rise Early and Sleep Late, Struggling to Get Enough to Eat; Many Children Die Due to Lack of Food and Clothing <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, according to Bishop Curtis, many people in Hangzhou are currently impoverished and unable to support themselves. Therefore, he is appealing for donations during the Christmas holidays and the weeks that follow to alleviate the disaster in the area. Donations can be given to the Baptist Church (Mr. Nasmyth), the China Inland Mission (Mr. Edwards), and the Presbyterian Church (Pastor Van Evera or Pastor Huss). According to reports from church workers in the area, the weather is severe, and many poor people are dying.</p>
<p>Those who lack clothing, food, and shelter, or those who do not have enough, are unable to cope. Poor families rise early and sleep late, and even if they find work, they struggle to get enough to eat. Prices have risen sharply recently, making even one meal a luxury. Furthermore, women and children eat less to leave more coarse food for the men. Half of the children inside and outside the city lack sufficient food and clothing.</p>
<p>Starvation and cold easily lead to death. The church has done its best to distribute rice and warm clothing for relief. One meal is distributed every day at noon, with about 200 children eating, and a varying number of adults. Leftover food from the hospital is also distributed to the poor. Each day, several poor people line up with bowls or jars to receive food, including a boy who is only four years old, accompanied by another boy to collect it.</p>
<p>There are also sick and elderly people who are completely destitute. Moreover, some poor families often accidentally start fires at night, fleeing in panic, exposed to the cold or burned. The sight is heartbreaking. To understand the suffering of the people of Hangzhou, one only needs to look at the approximately 200 men, women, and children who attend the gospel lectures twice a week, including exhausted rickshaw pullers, blind people (the number of blind people has increased greatly recently), and disabled people (some of whom are men forced to do hard labor and mistreated), as well as elderly women in their seventies who can only move with the help of a stool, their heads bandaged because they were injured when they did not quickly understand the sentry's instructions when entering the city. Many other women have suffered terrible wounds on their arms and legs for the same reason.</p>
<h3 id="e61">A Tour of the Literary and Art Exhibition <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ya</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the literary and art exhibition organized to raise production funds for the Shanghai Refugee Cooperative. I felt that China will fight to the end and will not stop until it wins the final victory. The invaders are in a dilemma, unable to dismount their tiger. Therefore, these refugees whose fields have been destroyed by ruthless artillery fire must be permanently maintained. Relying solely on donations for endless consumption, although there are many charitable people, ultimately does not seem like a good solution. Furthermore, the refugees, with nothing to do all day, may become accustomed to idleness over time, developing lazy habits. Therefore, the gentlemen of the Refugee Cooperative want to provide the refugees with productive work so that they will not have to rely solely on others for support in the future. This is a very meaningful thing, so I took some time to visit the exhibition.</p>
<p>At 9:45 AM, I arrived at the venue and immediately bought a ticket to enter. I didn't see the opening ribbon-cutting ceremony at all, but that wasn't my purpose. I wasn't there to see movie stars, so I didn't care if they weren't there. However, many spectators were crowding the entrance, seemingly to see these actresses. I don't know if they were able to feast their eyes. I only heard one student say, "They just have two eyes and a nose. What's so special?" This is a practical statement. Many calligraphy and paintings were hung on both sides of the entrance, mostly by Shen Shengyong, followed by the elder Shen Enfu. At the end of the entrance, I turned into a small room, which displayed stamps and cigarette cards. I enjoyed looking at them carefully and learned about the history of Chinese stamps. The earliest stamps were probably from the fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The paper quality was poor, the prints were rough, and the colors were purple, green, and yellow. They featured a coiled dragon in the center, with the price in the upper corners. The Empress Dowager Cixi's 60th birthday stamps featured a seal character for longevity in the center. The paper quality and colors were the same as before, but the shape was slightly larger. It was not until the 24th year of the Guangxu reign that they were printed in England, and the quality of the materials was also improved. There were also Soviet stamps, sent by the Political Department of the 1st Division of the 5th Army of the 3rd Army Corps of the Chinese Red Army to Liu Jicai in Pingjiang, Hunan. These are rare to see. The other stamps from various countries were all available, truly dazzling. The cigarette cards included ancient beauties, flowers, plants, birds, animals, thirty-six trades with proverbs, and scientific knowledge, in various forms. It can be said to be a grand collection of cigarette cards. Entering the hall again, in addition to calligraphy and paintings, there were photos of movie stars, diagrams of language evolution, and dynamic photos of Miao and Yao people. Browsing through them one by one, I truly broadened my knowledge.</p>
<p>Among the calligraphy and paintings, I loved Chen Tianxiao's "Su Shi Exploring Plum Blossoms," "Amitabha," "Willow Horse," and "Double Perch Double Habitat" the most. They used few strokes, but the expressions were lifelike, majestic, and contained endless meaning. They cannot be learned without artistic talent. Through the introduction of Mr. Huang Jingwan, I had the opportunity to meet him. After talking for a moment, I could say that the four words "refined and intelligent" could be used to describe Mr. Chen Daxiao without any shame.</p>
<p>The ancient paintings included "Cui Bai Flowers and Birds," "Li Tang Landscapes," "Jiayou Imperial Brush," and "Wang Zhongyuan Flowers and Birds," all meticulously painted and lifelike, and the prices were not high. If one could obtain one and hang it to the right of one's seat, one could appreciate it at leisure, which would give one a sense of elegance, especially as a souvenir to aid refugees during the war of resistance!</p>

<p>The Chinese Tannery on Tian Du Li, Xingan Temple Road, Shanghai, is a large-scale operation producing high-quality products. Recently, it received 29 packages of tanning glue (used for tanning leather), each package worth 80 yuan. Suddenly, nearby hooligans discovered this and gathered more than 30 accomplices, some carrying long guns, box cannons, and handguns. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, they broke open the main gate and stormed inside. Several workers in the factory resisted, but they were outnumbered and the bandits were armed. After a fierce fight, one worker, Weng Yingyue, 40 years old, from Ningbo, was shot in the right knee, the bullet piercing through, and he was bleeding profusely. Zhu Fulai, 39 years old, from Luodian, was hit in the head with a gun butt. Zhu Xiuming, 28 years old, from Luodian, was shot in the left shoulder, a serious injury. The 29 packages of tanning glue in the workshop were all looted, and the bandits fled, yelling. After the incident, the factory supervisor called an ambulance, which arrived and transported the three injured workers to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

Therefore, criminal public prosecution cases will be suspended for two days, but civil cases and criminal private prosecution cases will continue to be heard as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Public Toilet Dispute in the International Settlement; Both Sides Tend to Extremes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The 1940 contract for public toilets in the International Settlement was won by the Dongfang Cleaning Company at a high price. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now reported that as the contract period is about to expire, the company sent personnel to negotiate with various small subcontractors yesterday. The small subcontractors are unable to accept the contract because the bid price is too high and the Shanghai Municipal Council has regulations posted in each toilet stating that entry is free of charge and the sale of toilet paper is not allowed. However, the company has indicated that if the small subcontractors do not accept its fixed rental price, it will hire its own workers to sell toilet paper. It is said that it has already ordered worker uniforms and other items to forcibly take over. Both sides are tending to extremes, which may lead to further escalation.</p>

<p>Rickshaw merchants in the Special District have repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to reconsider and increase rickshaw rents due to rising prices after the war and the soaring prices of rubber and metal after the outbreak of the European war. The Shanghai Municipal Council organized a special committee to conduct an investigation. The investigation is now complete and will be formally decided by a meeting. The Shanghai Municipal Council has now replied to the guild that it must respond to the rent increase issue by the end of January 1940.</p>
<p>Conference of Representatives of Rickshaw Pullers in Five Districts</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, rickshaw pullers in the Special District held a conference of representatives from five districts. The results of the discussion were: (1) The weather is cold, but the hat-snatching trend is still rampant, causing a significant decline in business. Please order the police authorities to strictly crack down. (2) Organize the "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Relief Association," and elect Liu Zhuqing and eight others as preparation committee members. (3) Organize a legal team to fight for the takeover of the Mutual Aid Association by the rickshaw pullers. (4) Request rickshaw merchants to increase rickshaw rents, but not excessively.</p>
<p>Contractors Request Rent Increase</p>
<p>Rickshaw contractors in the Special District act as agents for rickshaw merchants, handling rickshaw rentals on a monthly and daily basis. For monthly rentals, the contractors are responsible for all repairs and painting. Recently, the prices of paint and metal have soared, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, they are requesting rickshaw merchants to negotiate an increase in rents as soon as possible to alleviate the contractors' burden.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Male Worker Accused of Seduction; Acquitted After Trial <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Li Changfu, a young man from Huaicheng, 23 years old, residing at 14, Meiquan Li, Jiale Road, works at the Liangxinji toothbrush factory on Xujiahui Road, Panxing Road. Recently, he was sued in the criminal court of the Second Special Court for disrupting family affairs by Lin Li, the mother (37 years old, residing at 47 Mofang Street) of Lin Xiulan (17 years old), a female worker in the toothbrush department of the same factory. According to the complaint, on the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, Xiulan was seduced by Li to see a movie at the Ameng Grand Theater at Taiping Bridge, and then taken to Room 15 of the Yongxing Hotel on Wangzhi Road, where she was forcibly raped and released only at night. After learning of the situation, the police were reported to and requested to investigate. However, because an examination showed that the victim's hymen was not broken, the case was not pursued. Therefore, the plaintiff further accused the defendant of being unreasonable and filed a lawsuit according to law, and also filed a civil suit requesting the court to order the defendant to pay compensation of 1,000 yuan. Based on the complaint, Judge Miao Qingbang of the court held a hearing the day before. The plaintiff mother and daughter presented their case, and the defendant, accompanied by defense lawyer Qian Xingzhong, appeared in court and denied seduction and rape. According to the defendant, on the 22nd, he went to see a movie with a male worker from the same factory surnamed Bao and two female guests. At the theater, they met Lin Xiulan, who offered him cigarettes and melon seeds, but he did not accept them. After the movie, she asked them to go to her house to play, but because there were four of them, men and women, they refused to go. The next evening, when they were leaving work, Xiulan publicly pulled him to open a room, but he refused. The conflict arose because she wanted to marry him, but he refused because he was already engaged in his hometown, which led to the false accusation. He asked the court to investigate. The court also summoned witnesses surnamed Bao and Huo Xiangting for questioning. As the case was clear, the court ordered the defense to be made, and then immediately acquitted the defendant in court and rejected the civil suit.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Refugee Cooperative held a literary and art exhibition the day before yesterday (the 23rd) to raise production funds, people from all walks of life flocked to visit the exhibition in unusually large numbers. The cooperative originally planned to hold the exhibition for three days, ending today, but because many of the exhibits submitted by various sectors were not yet displayed, it was decided to extend the exhibition by one day, ending tomorrow (the 26th). Yesterday was Sunday, a holiday for various schools and institutions, so the number of visitors was even more crowded than the day before, estimated at more than 6,000 people. In terms of groups, there were several groups, including the Fine Arts College and the Peichu Elementary School. The new exhibits added yesterday included dozens of photos of armed Miao people, open-air gatherings, and other photos in the language and culture section, all of which were rare and valuable treasures.</p>

<p>Near Xinza Road and Chengdu Road in the International Settlement, at around 8:30 PM last night, two fruit vendors, Shi Zhengxiang, 26 years old, from Chongming, and his cousin Shi Qinfu, 25 years old, were carrying oranges on a shoulder pole, selling them along the street. Several customers came to select oranges and started bargaining, which suddenly led to an argument, and then to violence. Unexpectedly, several customers used a bamboo shoulder pole to strike Shi Qinfu, who was hit in the head, causing a hole to be punched through and blood to flow straight out. At that time, Shi Zhengxiang, who was standing next to him, saw his cousin being injured and falling to the ground, and tried his best to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, several customers' remaining anger did not subside, and they surrounded Zhengxiang and beat him severely, using both fists and feet, injuring his abdomen and vital organs, killing him instantly. Afterwards, the police at Xinza Police Station No. 50, together with street police No. 958 and No. 1776, arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested two perpetrators at the scene, detaining them at the police station for investigation. Shi Qinfu, who was injured, and the corpse were sent to Baolong Hospital by ambulance.</p>

<p>According to news from the agency, a Japanese man named Eiji Kageyama, 53 years old, came to Shanghai last year and then went to the interior. He returned to Shanghai again in January of this year, residing at No. 310 Huangpu Road, Hongkou. He usually behaved extravagantly, dressed luxuriously, and had the air of a gentleman. He often claimed to be a university professor, having served as a section chief in the Accounting Inspection Institute and as a consultant for the Toyo Tobacco Company, etc. He boasted to the Japanese expatriates in Shanghai that he had considerable connections with various Japanese military and political circles. In reality, Kageyama was a vagrant with no permanent occupation. Recently, he even impersonated a member of the Japanese military police and solicited various Japanese businesses in Shanghai to commit fraud. Unaware of his deception, more than a dozen Japanese businessmen were deceived, with the amount swindled reaching 12,000 yuan. After obtaining the large sum through fraud, Kageyama went to Nanjing and spent his days squandering money like dirt on the Qinhuai River, indulging in a life of pleasure and extravagance, which aroused the suspicion of the Japanese military police. After a detailed investigation, he was arrested, and recently escorted to this port. The Japanese Consulate then escorted him back to Japan.</p>

The customs office has already sent a letter to the local government for punishment according to regulations. Subsequently, Jin Dazhong, the agent of Anli Company, stated that the smuggled tung oil was the doing of a sailor named Jiang Azeng, who was immediately arrested and sent for punishment.</p>

<p>To the editor,</p>
<p>According to the person concerned, Yu Xiaoyue, on the 24th of this month, the Shanghai News column of the Shen Bao published a news item about a factory owner suing an apprentice for breach of contract. It stated that in the 25th year, Mr. Song introduced Yu Xiaoyue to the plaintiff to learn the skill of making soy sauce. This is inconsistent with the facts. It was found that Xiaoyue entered the factory to help Chen Genzha with his finances, and he had chemical experience. Therefore, he was a supervisor of finance and an assistant in manufacturing, not a student. The plaintiff, Chen Genxiang, falsely claiming that he was a student, is related to Xiaoyue's reputation. I am particularly requesting that you ask the newspaper to declare a correction so as to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3 id="e82">A Review of China's Economy Over the Past Year <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bianlin</p>
<p>During this past year, China's economy has undergone major changes, such as the fall of foreign exchange rates, the slump in foreign debt market prices, the sharp increase in international trade, the increase in currency circulation, and the rise in prices. The outbreak of the European War has changed everything and has already entered a difficult environment. Now, the economic situation and statistical figures of the past year will be analyzed in detail as follows.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates Over the Past Year</p>
<p>After the implementation of exchange controls in March of the 27th year, a black market for foreign exchange was created in Shanghai. In September of the same year, the black market exchange rate fell to a low of eight pence. The government authorities worked hard to maintain the exchange rate, which was stabilized. In March of this year, the Sino-British cooperation on the foreign exchange equalization fund was established, and the black market exchange rate became more solid. However, maintaining the black market exchange rate and using huge amounts of funds for the Japanese and puppet regimes to absorb and for luxury consumption in Shanghai does not seem to be a good idea. On June 7, the implementation of the cessation of foreign exchange supply was carried out. As a result, the downward trend suddenly rose, from eight pence to below six and a half pence. However, this downward trend was not enough to adjust the reverse trend of international trade; and although the absorption of the Japanese and puppet regimes was slightly frustrated, it still failed to stop. Therefore, it was allowed to fall again to five and a half pence. Those who did not understand the truth and were short-sighted became alarmed and panicked; speculators and ordinary traitors took the opportunity to spread rumors and fueled the waves, thus causing a large amount of capital flight, causing the foreign exchange black market to continue to shrink sharply. On July 25, it was 4 pence 5625, on August 1, it dropped to 4 pence 3125, on August 8, it dropped again to 3 pence 875, and on August 11, it fell further to 3 pence 25, creating an unprecedented low price for the legal tender.</p>
<p>After that, the European situation became tense, and the foreign exchange black market was stimulated by this, reversing the past sharp decline and turning into a sharp rise. Former foreign exchange speculators and capital flight people sold off one after another. The supply of foreign exchange in the black market at one time exceeded demand. On September 4, the black market price reached 4 pence 75. There was a brief period of weakness, especially the decline in the US exchange rate was greater than that of British gold. At that time, the pound price in the New York market fell sharply, so the HSBC quoted the lowest price of 5 and a half yuan for the US exchange rate. At the end of September, the exchange rate rebounded again, and the continued upward trend lasted for more than a month. At the end of October, it had grown to a level of 5 and a half pence for British exchange and 8 and a half yuan for US exchange. For a time, it was close to 6 pence and the exchange rate of the US dollar. The reasons for the high rise can be attributed to the following: (1) Due to the outbreak of the European War, imports decreased sharply, and exports were still able to be maintained due to the strong sales in the United States. Therefore, a large number of export bills of exchange appeared in the black market, while the need for import foreign exchange decreased. (2) Since Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia implemented exchange controls, the Hong Kong gangs and others came to Shanghai to sell foreign exchange one after another. (3) Capital flighters returned one after another due to the consolidation of the legal tender's credit, and foreign exchange positions increased sharply. (4) The Japanese absorption weakened, and there were also small amounts of selling, and the need for foreign exchange decreased further. (5) The credit of foreign currencies themselves was shaken, and general speculators went to other places. Therefore, the black market price had one less pressure. Often, when foreign exchange rates were high, news of victories from the front came, and people's hearts became more stable. This upward trend began to stabilize in mid-November and hovered around 5 pence. However, although exports increased, imports also increased. For example, the cotton of textile factories and the food rice, which is the main food of the people, must now be supplied overseas. Therefore, importers are paying a lot. In addition, the movement of international hot money is uncertain, which makes the foreign exchange black market fluctuate from time to time. Speculators also took the opportunity to participate, so it fell slightly again from the end of the month. At the end of the year, the demand for legal tender increased, so the foreign exchange market was rising again. The HSBC quote and black market closing prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) The British exchange rate is the number of pence per national currency yuan. (1) is the foreign exchange rate on December 19.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Domestic Debt Market Prices Over the Past Year <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The domestic debt market prices over the past year have been relatively stable. Although there have been three changes in the meantime, they have all been able to rebound afterwards, and the current prices are similar to those at the beginning of the year. This shows the good financial situation of China.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the Ministry of Finance had a plan to move to Chongqing to pay the principal and interest due, which promoted the first change. Afterwards, it was paid in installments in Shanghai, and the situation calmed down. Afterwards, the debts rebounded, and on June 13, a record high since the start of the war was created. On June 19, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed that the unified debts guaranteed by customs duties would also stop being paid due to the seizure of tax revenues. Therefore, the second change occurred. When foreign exchange shrank sharply in July, the unified debts also plummeted, creating the lowest price since the start of the war. This was the third change. After the outbreak of the European War, the debt market was strong, and the unified debts tended to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Foreign Debt Market Prices Over the Past Year <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the year, foreign debt market prices were generally low, but there was a rebound trend afterwards. After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee stopped supplying foreign exchange in June, Chinese foreign debt in the London market plummeted. When foreign exchange shrank sharply in Shanghai in July and August, foreign debt also continued to fall. It began to stabilize after the European War. In mid-November, there was a sharp rise, with an average increase of more than 10 pounds compared to October. On November 15, such as the Anglo-German continued loan reached 57 pounds, the Sino-French public bond reached 52 pounds, and the Anglo-French loan reached 50 pounds, which was much higher than Japanese foreign debt. On the same day, the Japanese 5% British public bond was 49 pounds, and the first 4% British public bond was only 40 and a half pounds. From this, it can be seen that China's national credit is better than Japan's, and China's national fortune is brighter than Japan's. The average price of China's main foreign debt in the London market is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Note) The unit is pounds. (1) is the highest price from November 1 to 18. (2) is the average market price from December 5 to 18.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Foreign Trade Over the Past Year <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Foreign trade this year showed a leaping trend, and exports increased faster than imports. Since March, the total value of imports each month has been more than 100 million yuan. After the outbreak of the European War, imports decreased slightly, but they are now gradually returning to their original state. And it is a good opportunity to promote exports. (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>The deficit figures reached their peak in May and June. After the cessation of foreign exchange supply, it was sharply reduced. It decreased further after the European War, and was only 5 million yuan in October. With the current trend, there may be hope for a surplus in the future. It is worth noting that import trade is still so huge under government control and the fall of foreign exchange rates. The reasons for this are: the increase in consumption in Shanghai, one; using Chinese foreign exchange to purchase raw materials needed by Japanese factories, such as cotton, etc., two; daily necessities such as food rice and coal are monopolized by people, and we have to rely on overseas supply, three; Japanese goods are dumped, four; speculation is strong, and hoarding is rampant, five; the increase in income from non-labor profits leads to indulgence in consumption, and the increase in the import of luxury goods, six. If the above six points are not eliminated, it will be difficult to drastically reduce import trade. The main reasons for the increase in export goods are as follows: the development of transportation in the rear area has made transportation more convenient than before, so the export capacity has increased, this is one. Japanese businessmen scavenge local products in the occupied areas and transport them for sale to Europe and the United States to seize China's export foreign exchange resources; this is also one of the key points; this is two. The fall in foreign exchange makes it easier for goods to be sold overseas, this is three. Shanghai's light industry has returned to its pre-war state, but manufactured goods cannot be sold well in the occupied areas, so it has to seek overseas sales channels, this is four. The increase in overseas demand, such as the sale of raw silk to the United States, the sale of animals and animal products to Europe, and the sale of manufactured goods to Southeast Asia, are all at the highest records in recent years, this is five. Now there is another good opportunity for the European War. As long as the people of the whole country work hard, exports will definitely increase again.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Commodity Prices Over the Past Year <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Commodity prices rose sharply in the middle of the year, and people's lives were greatly threatened. In the past, the items that rose sharply were limited to imported goods and non-essential goods, so the general public did not feel difficult. Nowadays, treacherous merchants are targeting daily necessities, hoarding and stockpiling to wait for a good price, which has a great impact on people's livelihood. Now, let's look at the wholesale price index compiled by the National Tariff Commission, as follows:</p>
<p>Year 28 Year 27</p>
<p>January 162.1 133.6</p>
<p>February 165.5 132.4</p>
<p>March 172.1 133.2</p>
<p>April 173.2 136.7</p>
<p>May 176.1 135.8</p>
<p>June 190.7 138.9</p>
<p>July 195.5 146.4</p>
<p>The above is limited to the commodity price index for the first seven months, and the degree of high rise is already alarming. Moreover, since July, the upward trend has become even stronger. Try to look at the cost of living index in Shanghai, and you can know it. It was 188.56 in July, 234.17 in August, surged to 183.23 in September, and fell slightly to 248.22 in October. The main reason for the high prices today is mostly due to hoarding by treacherous merchants, followed by inconvenient transportation and uneven supply. If this continues, the lives of ordinary people will become even more insecure. Therefore, our government is working hard to adjust commodity prices. (December 20)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Past Week <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Selling Rice at a Lower Price, Robbery According to reports, a rice store in Caojiadu, seeing that a crowd of people were surging to rob rice, the boss accepted the store clerk's suggestion and implemented a flat sale of 38 yuan per stone, avoiding being robbed. This is really knowing the reason for the rice grabbing trend, and at the same time, it is actually better than the good method of half-opening the door to prevent robbery. Worth introducing All-pervasive In order to achieve their goal of using war to support war, the Japanese puppet regimes have exploited every opportunity for profit in many ways. In the past, they organized the "Fish Market" to control the fish industry, and organized the "Livestock Market" to control the cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc. transported to Shanghai, and they have also obstructed the grain transported to Shanghai in many ways, adding levies. Although the high rice price in Shanghai has various complex factors such as hoarding, the exploitation of the Japanese puppet regimes is also one of the main reasons; now, according to reports, the Sihang Warehouse, which is firmly guarded by the isolated army, is now being repaired to prepare for the opening of a "Vegetable Market" to control vegetables and salted goods. In this way, the small people will be under new threats under the pressure of rice, coal, oil, and noodles. It is really not easy to live in Shanghai.</p>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Everyone is Happy The end of the year is approaching in a blink of an eye, and all industries are busy closing accounts. This year, due to the changes in foreign exchange and the rise in prices, all industrial and commercial enterprises have made huge profits, so recently, the prices of stocks such as yarn factories have risen uniformly. It is said that the most profitable industries are rice, cotton, yarn, oil, etc. It is estimated that yarn factory employees will have 100 months of bonuses to share; those in the banking and finance industry who are engaged in foreign exchange speculation have also made amazing profits. Shanghai has such huge profits to be made, of course, they are happy and forget Shu, and they have completely abandoned the important task of investing in the southwest and building the rear area, which is really heartbreaking to say. And those who profit are all happy, and they are oblivious.</p>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>When Will It End After the Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee implemented emergency measures to limit rice prices, general rice stores closed their doors at the same time due to the popularity of rice grabbing, and operated in a small hole. In some people's homes, the hole is so small that even a washing basket cannot be stuffed in, making it very inconvenient for small people to buy rice. If there are too many people, they have to wait for a long time at the hole, which is unbearable. Although there was a saying that all rice stores would reopen from the day before yesterday, some rice stores are still closed, and even write "This store's stock is sold out and business is temporarily suspended. Transactions will be carried out when goods are received." Most of the small rice stores are taking a wait-and-see attitude, only selling and not buying, selling out the stock first. As a result, some have japonica rice but no indica rice, and some have indica rice but no japonica rice. If you go to buy rice, if you are not careful, you will have to go to several stores in a row. This situation is really too inconvenient for rice buyers. We hope that the rice industry authorities will quickly find a way to make the rice stores open their doors uniformly to reduce the inconvenience of rice buyers!</p>

<p>This publication has reached its 300th issue. It is really a very gratifying thing in China that a rigid supplement can be maintained for such a long time with the love of readers. Therefore, it has been decided to start with this issue the plan to add a "Small Mailbox" to this publication as requested by readers; on the one hand, it will help readers solve all their questions to thank the old readers for their love for this publication; at the same time, it will also be regarded as a commemorative issue for the 300th issue of this publication.</p>
<p>Chen Jiejun asked: The Central Bank quotes the Shanghai Standard Bullion price, which is obtained by multiplying the daily Guanjin market price by a fixed number of 57979. However, the fineness of the bullion is 978, and the purchase price of pure gold in China is less than 5 yuan higher than the standard gold price. For example, on December 13, the Central Bank quoted the Shanghai Standard Bullion price as $1,366.20, and on the same day, the purchase price of pure gold in China was $1,370.90. Please show its calculation basis and method.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan replied: The Shanghai Standard Gold price and the pure gold purchase market price quoted by the Central Bank are both calculated based on the London gold price as the standard. The calculation methods will be explained separately on the left:</p>
<p>(A) Standard Bullion</p>
<p>One bar of bullion is equal to ten taels of Shanghai weight, with a fineness of 978. Each tael of Shanghai weight is equal to 1.0047107 ounces. Therefore, one bar of bullion is actually equal to 9.826070 ounces. 10 x 0.978 x 1.0047107 = 9.8260707</p>
<p>Now that the London gold price is 8 pounds and 8 shillings per gold ounce (equivalent to 2016 pence), and the Central Bank's quoted British exchange rate is still one shilling and two and a half pence (equivalent to 14 and a half pence), the following equation can be obtained—</p>
<p>2016 ÷ 14.5 x 9.8260707 = 1366.16 Rounding off, we get 1366.20 yuan</p>
<p>(B), Pure Gold Purchase Market Price Although it is called pure gold here, its fineness is only 999. If it is ten taels of pure gold, calculated according to the above ratio, it is actually equal to 10.03706 gold ounces</p>
<p>40 x 999 x 1.0047107 = 10.03706 The London gold price is 2016 pence, and the Central Bank purchases pure gold at a foreign exchange selling price of one shilling, two and three-quarters of a pence (equivalent to 14 and three-quarters of a pence). The calculation formula can be obtained—2016 ÷ 14.75 = 10.03706 = 1371.84 Rounding off, we get 1371.80 yuan.</p>
<p>The purchase price of pure gold in China on December 13 mentioned in the letter was 1370.90 yuan, but the Central Bank quoted 1371.80 yuan, which may be a misprint, and the fixed number 579.79 is an error of 507.79.</p>
<p>Chen Jiejun asked: In the commercial news column, the prices of foreign currencies in various countries, British gold notes, and American gold notes are calculated based on the foreign exchange market. However, there are also two types of market prices for British gold pounds and American gold pounds. For example, on December 13, British notes were $46.00, British pounds were $95.60, American notes were $13.12, and American pounds were $98.00. I don’t know what standard the prices of the above British pounds and American pounds are based on.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Zuoxuan replied: The "British gold notes" or "American gold notes" listed in the commercial news column refer to the paper money of that country; as for "British gold pounds" or "American gold pounds", they refer to coins (those cast in gold). The former is paper money, so its price is calculated based on the foreign exchange market; the latter is gold coins, so its price is calculated based on the amount of pure gold it contains.</p>
<p>According to the ratio of conversion to Shanghai taels (one Shanghai tael is equal to 31.25 grams, which is also equal to 482.26 grains),</p>
<p>The amount of pure gold contained in each British gold pound is approximately equal to 23 cents of Shanghai tael. (7.32 ÷ 31.25 = 0.23)</p>
<p>The amount of pure gold contained in each American gold pound is approximately equal to 24 cents of Shanghai tael. (116.1 ÷ 482.26 = 24)</p>
<p>Now the black market gold price in Shanghai is more than 4,000 yuan (calculated per ten taels), so the prices of British and American gold pounds are each more than 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Hengqin replied, Mr. Lu Xiuchuan asked, because there are too many questions, they will be published in the next issue. Please forgive me!</p>

<h3 id="e89">Grains: Imported Rice Prices Rise, Nearing Those of Second-Grade Japonica <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was initially quiet. Generally, customers have recently favored imported rice as their primary purchase. Now, with the price of imported rice increasing, it is approaching that of second-grade japonica. Buyers are hesitant to make further purchases and plan to wait and see. As a result, the morning market was exceptionally deserted with little activity. Later, it was announced that the market would be closed today for Christmas. Local merchants, anticipating increased demand, started buying, focusing on imported rice. Consequently, the demand for Saigon and Siamese rice increased sharply, with some interest in japonica as well, tightening the market. However, transactions remained sporadic, leading to a brief surge followed by a decline. Ultimately, prices fluctuated by only two or three cents. Saigon early market "tuantuanli" (round grain) opened at 37.5 yuan, closing at 37.8 yuan for "tuantuanli" and 37.5 yuan for "changli" (long grain). Siamese rice was priced at 38 yuan, an increase of about three cents compared to the previous day. Prices for thick and thin japonica rice had mostly reached their limits, with only a small difference between medium and second-grade rice, around half a yuan. Low-grade "hudou" (coarse rice) opened at 37.5 yuan per "hu." "Lujian te" (reed tip special) was priced at 39.5 yuan, "shi" (market grade) at 39 yuan, and "yangjian te" (sheep tip special) at 39 yuan, with "shi" (market grade) at 38.5 yuan, varying according to quality. It appeared that there was a hidden increase of two or three cents. White yuan rice, a seasonal necessity, increased by half a yuan. "Kejian" (customer grade) saw no activity, with total market transactions lower than before, only about four to five thousand bags.</p>
<p>Recently, the supply from inland sources has been inconsistent. After over 500 bags of "qingjiao" (greenhorn) rice were transported by truck, the supply stopped. According to merchants, this year's rice production is generally good, with each area having about 80% of a normal harvest. In areas such as Changshu, Xixi, and Danyang alone, the rice production is estimated to be in the millions of "shi." Including Jiangsu, Jiaxing, Qingpu, Songjiang, Sishui, Nantong, Jiangbei, and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the total production would be at least three to five hundred million "shi." Therefore, if the supply channels can be opened up and not restricted, the rice price in Shanghai will naturally stabilize.</p>

<p>The price of white coal dust has risen repeatedly since last week, affecting the costs of coal ball factories, making it impossible to ship goods. The industry association was asked to raise factory prices, but Yitaixing believed that coal ball prices had already risen several times, making further increases difficult. Therefore, starting today, they are willing to reduce the price of coal dust by two yuan to support the business of small factories. The prices are now: Hongji first-grade dust, 73 yuan per ton; second-grade dust, 68 yuan. Therefore, the price of coal balls will remain unchanged for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Winter Solstice Hygiene <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Materia Medica of Food states: "Pheasant meat is sour and cold, and non-toxic. Although a delicacy from the wild, eating it is more harmful than beneficial, except in the eleventh month when it is nourishing." Shaoqing notes that pheasant is commonly known as wild chicken. According to the Materia Medica of Food, it is beneficial to eat it around the Winter Solstice, but harmful during other months. Western customs dictate eating turkey during Christmas (commonly known as Foreign Winter Solstice), which is similar to our country's tradition of eating pheasant during Winter Solstice.</p>
<p>The Essentials of Nourishing Life states: "During the Winter Solstice, yang energy returns to the abdomen, making it easier to digest hot foods." Shaoqing notes: Hot foods are easier to digest in the abdomen, not only during the Winter Solstice, but also during other months and times. However, the price of firewood and charcoal is several times higher than before, leading to lamentations that firewood is as expensive as cassia. Even middle-class families find it difficult to afford, let alone the poor who cannot afford hot food to nourish themselves and maintain hygiene.</p>
<p>The Principles of Following Nature states: "Five days after the Winter Solstice, husband and wife should sleep separately and refrain from intimacy, or their lifespan will be reduced." Shaoqing notes: During winter, all things should be stored, and we should take care of our health. Excessive activity without storage harms the foundation, leading to illness and reduced lifespan. This principle is easy to understand. As for the statement that husband and wife should sleep separately five days after the Winter Solstice, I disagree. The way of husband and wife should be observed at all times, but especially during winter when separation is necessary, and abstinence is essential after the Winter Solstice. Wealthy men and women take tonics in winter, presumably to remedy the damage caused by not sleeping separately. However, the power of medicine cannot compensate for the fundamental loss. Today, on the Winter Solstice, I urge those who habitually take tonics to follow the ancient precept of sleeping separately, save some money, and support the clothing and food of the poor to foster harmony with nature.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Christmas Dinner <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The Christmas holiday is not just a season for "play," but also a season for "eating." Tonight's "Christmas dinner" unfolds with splendor, amidst bright lights and resounding music. The most indispensable highlight is turkey.</p>
<p>Those plump turkeys (another name for turkeys), in shades of reddish-yellow, bronze, black, and white, meticulously prepared by master chefs using rich oil and sweet sauces, are arranged in large platters on tables covered with snow-white cloths. Exquisitely seasoned and delectable, the "Christmas turkey" is considered the most fashionable food of the "Christmas dinner!"</p>
<p>Red, yellow, green, and white "Christmas puddings" (commonly known as Christmas cakes), in square and triangular shapes, are similarly arranged next to the turkey, as a delightful treat after the "Christmas dinner!"</p>
<p>Speaking of "Christmas dinner," in British customs, it is regarded as our country's "reunion dinner." During dinner, the whole family sits together to eat. Even distant travelers who cannot make it home for the reunion dinner must have an empty seat reserved for them, along with prayers and blessings.</p>
<p>In India, there are no "Christmas hotels" to provide a Christmas dinner gathering for Englishmen residing far away.</p>
<p>Christmas festivities in Singapore are exceptionally lively. It is said that fishermen "living on the sea," even during foggy weather, must rush home for Christmas, just like "sitting together and happily chatting" in their home country.</p>
<p>As for the "Christmas dinners" eaten in places like New York and Chicago in the United States, they are a world for those with a penchant for Liu Ling (a famous drunkard) and the legacy of Li Bai (a famous poet). Drunk on wine, revelers sing, dance, and often vomit, reeking of alcohol, with many collapsing on the streets, sound asleep.</p>
<p>I would also like to make an additional appeal: Let us not be too unrestrained in our behavior at today's "Christmas dinner" in Shanghai. Why not embrace Jesus's love and compassion, moderate our desires for food, and everyone save a portion to help the suffering and helpless refugees?</p>
<h3 id="e95">A Study of Holy Communion Foods <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>On the Christmas banquet table, the menu offers many dishes. According to Western legend, in the ancient halls of the Saxon people, at the beginning of the banquet, the drinkers were blessed, and then fragrant ale was passed to each person. The heyday of this type of banquet was probably during the Elizabethan period when the Christmas Eve banquet had as many as one hundred and twenty dishes. Royal Christmas banquets were generally similar. The enthusiasm for celebrating Christmas at that time can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>The arrival of Christmas is an annual event, and traditionally, up until now, Holy Communion is held on Christmas Eve. On the banquet table, the usual turkey, roast beef, plum pudding, meat pies, and orange juice are indispensable. However, the situation was somewhat different when Holy Communion was held at Buckingham Palace in England one hundred and thirty years ago. On the menu, the plum pudding course was removed and replaced with a very thick bowl of strawberry porridge, which was served as the first course. However, in the Duke of Blackingham's house, meat pies were served twice, and there was also no plum pudding. Orange juice was an indispensable course, and it was made from real fresh oranges, with the Chinese variety being preferred for its sweetness and delicious flavor.</p>
<p>At the Holy Communion table, there were also many vegetables, which might surprise some people. At that time, one of the chefs in the British royal palace was British and had studied cooking under a famous Welsh chef. His skills were indeed very high, and no other chefs could match him. After serving seven meat dishes, at least six vegetable dishes were offered, either on the dining table or on another table. On December 25th, Christmas Day, he first served rice porridge, followed by a turkey and a truffle dish. On the other side of the table, there was a plate of chicken and duck congee, and a plate of beef kidneys. Truffles could be found in many parts of England.</p>
<p>Other meat dishes included lard bread decorated with asparagus and peas, a plate of salted pork, a beef tongue, two plates of rabbit meat with sour sauce, roast lamb with gourd, stir-fried beef and kidney, stir-fried mushrooms, lamb shanks with hyacinth beans, spring chicken with parsley, oyster cakes, partridges, guinea fowl, six snipe, and a pheasant.</p>
<p>Vegetables included cauliflower, Jerusalem artichoke roots, spinach, French beans, asparagus, red cabbage, and mushrooms. Desserts were not very abundant, including a powdered sweet cake, a cabbage cake, a cheese cake, sweet buns, small steamed buns, sponge cakes, and cream cakes. From what has been said above, it can be seen that a hundred years ago, the Christmas banquet table was far more abundant than it is today. However, while Christmas banquets are simpler now, many are still based on past traditions.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Christmas Pudding <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>According to Western custom, this item is always indispensable at banquets or feasts during Christmas: Christmas pudding. This "Christmas pudding" can be made into various styles at any time, depending on the skills of the housewife or chef; therefore, it is also a difficult task. The following are unique customs for Christmas pudding in various countries:</p>
<p>In Sweden and Denmark, Christmas pudding is made to look like a pig's head and is not eaten until after Christmas Day.</p>
<p>In Germany and France, Christmas puddings are made into the shapes of strange animals.</p>
<p>In Poland, it is first mixed with water and flour before being made, and on the surface of the pudding are engraved sentences used by monks, which cannot be eaten until the evening of that day.</p>
<p>In Romania, there is a custom where "Christmas pudding" is just pieces of hard, dry biscuits, which must be eaten with honey and other sugary sauces.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Eating two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes every day, over and over again, it's always the same, and there's really no way to change it up. Now, I have a way to adjust it, which is to eat noodles or vegetable rice once a week, which can also change the taste. When eating noodles, you can follow the "crossing the bridge" method in noodle restaurants and have stir-fried shredded pork with bamboo shoots, or braised beef or mutton. When eating vegetable rice, all you need is a big bowl of soup, whether it's chicken blood tofu or meat slices with egg drop soup, and you won't feel the vegetable rice is too dry. As for how to cook vegetable rice, it can be economical or not economical. Economical: just use green vegetables or shepherd's purse; if you want it to be more chewy, you can add some yams or bean sprouts. If you want to be more particular, then you can put as much diced winter bamboo shoots, fresh meat slices, and diced cured meat as you want, or even replace them with chicken or duck slices.</p>

<p>— Yinhong</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year, people inevitably think of Christmas. Indeed, in Shanghai, whether in the windows of major stores along the streets or in various places in newspapers, you can see an old man in red with a white beard, carrying a full package on his back, driving a reindeer sleigh. This is the "Santa Claus" that people love the most! And especially children feel the happiest, because Santa Claus will give them all kinds of candies they love to eat. But what about the general public? They regard Christmas as a carnival. Whether in "clothing, food, housing, and transportation," everyone wants to celebrate a joyous night. Now, let's talk about "clothing, food, housing, and transportation" related to Christmas.</p>
<p>Christmas was introduced from Europe and the United States, so in European and American countries, every year on this day, whether parents or children, they wear brand new clothes and bring many gifts to give to their relatives and friends. When they arrive at a relative's house, people see that your clothes are so brand new, and they expect that you will definitely receive the happiness of Santa Claus. In theaters everywhere, there are new costume competitions, mostly participated in by young girls. They wear especially bright and dazzling new costumes to compete with each other, and invite visitors to judge. If they can be selected as the first place, everyone confirms that she will definitely receive unexpected good luck in the coming year.</p>
<p>There is the most to eat during Christmas, such as Christmas cakes and Christmas puddings, which are necessary foods. Among them, the most famous and only delicacy is the American turkey. However, because it is delicious and fatty, the price is also very expensive. In European and American countries, buying a turkey requires about twenty US dollars, but this year, since the outbreak of the European War, cargo transportation in various places has been blocked, and turkeys are certainly no exception, so prices have soared to more than double. In Shanghai, in addition to American turkeys, turkeys produced in Dinghai Zhoushan are also very famous, and the number shipped to Shanghai every year is very large, but unfortunately Zhoushan has now fallen, so the source is scarce and the price is also more expensive. There is also a custom during Christmas to invent a novel and delicious food to predict future wealth.</p>
<p>In several towns on the Mullinson Islands in northern England, there is a long-standing custom of camping in the forest on a hillside on the night of Christmas every year, and even the children go. The next morning, as soon as the children get up, they see that their socks are filled with many candies and foods, so they are very happy. The parents tell the children that Santa Claus gave them, so the children will always like that old man. In fact, these are all put in the bags by their parents!</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, people in every city and town in Europe and the United States become like lunatics, and everyone celebrates enthusiastically. Whether it is in dance halls, bars, cinemas, ice skating rinks, etc., they are filled with a joyous atmosphere, happily enjoying a night of fun. In fact, isn't it the same in Shanghai? The cost of a night of fun is at least dozens of yuan per person, which can be said to be extremely luxurious. However, although Shanghai this year is still playing all night as usual, because of the gunpowder atmosphere of the war in European and American countries, I am afraid that there will not be the same joy as before!</p>

<h3 id="e99">Tram Fare Increase <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Fang</p>
<p>The tram fare increase issue, which has been causing a lot of turmoil, was finally passed at the most recent meeting of the Public Works Department and has been officially implemented by the tram company since the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>Originally, the tram fare increase issue seemed to be a very minor event, not worthy of our attention at all, and even less worthy of being discussed in the newspaper. However, in today's Shanghai, with its turbulent society and expensive rice and firewood, it is not easy for the average person to ensure a continuous supply of three meals a day and worry-free clothing to keep warm. How can they withstand another burden on their living expenses in terms of transportation, namely, the tram fare increase? Therefore, the tram company's proposal to increase fares today has become a social problem, and it has also added another direct blow to the general middle and lower classes. Here, let me analyze its established facts:</p>
<p>First, from the tram company's own reasons, it is due to the contraction of foreign exchange, huge expenditures, and the inability to balance income and expenditure. Therefore, it believes that increasing fares is the best way to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. Regarding this, we know that from the tram company's point of view, there is a considerable reason, but in fact, it is seemingly correct but actually wrong, and very far-fetched. Because the contraction of foreign exchange today is indeed a fact, however, if we recall the period of this year's July and August, when the foreign exchange market was most harmful, it was probably the lowest. But why didn't the tram company immediately increase fares at that time (because it had already increased once in early July this year), at least it would be more in line with the facts than now.</p>
<p>Second, it is said that this tram company's fare increase is not only to increase fares, but also to change the station distances, and the amount of fare increase per station distance seems to be set too high.</p>
<p>Third, this time the tram fare increase is only for the British tram company in the Public Concession, and the fares of the French tram company have not been increased or changed. From this we can know that although the two have different systems and different administrations, why is it that the French tram company does not consider this, and is so generous?</p>
<p>In short, the tram is originally a publicly operated enterprise, and its purpose is to facilitate the people. Moreover, from the perspective of the characteristics of a publicly operated enterprise, it is not entirely for profit. And we can also clearly know that most of the people who take the tram are from the middle and lower classes, because they benefit from its speed and cheapness in price. And now, in the midst of the difficult life on the isolated island, and the endless voices of rising prices and speculation, another unexpected burden has been added, which really makes people unable to help but shout out the cry of "It is not easy to live on the isolated island." The reason why I see this as a serious social problem is precisely here.</p>
<p>Finally, the tram company's fare increase is now an established fact, and it has already increased almost twice as much as when the "August 13th" Shanghai war just broke out. However, I still hope that the Public Works Department and the company authorities will carefully consider it, and that once the situation in Shanghai improves and the company's income increases, they will immediately reduce and re-establish it, and do not make "it is easy to increase prices but difficult to reduce them" a successful conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Give an Example <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Di</p>
<p>The Public Concession tram fares have increased again from the 22nd. According to the company's stated reason for the fare increase, it is due to the contraction of foreign exchange, and the inability to balance income and expenditure. The contraction of foreign exchange is a fact, and the inability to balance income and expenditure, then we small people dare not make wild guesses. However, judging from the situation that can be seen, even if the income and expenditure are really unbalanced, then this "inability to balance income and expenditure" cannot be compensated by a fare increase. (Regarding this point, the company authorities are probably very clear.)</p>
<p>After the Shanghai War, the population of the "isolated island" increased sharply to five million. The tram is a public utility, and with the increase in population, the tram business naturally also increases. This can be known by looking at the passengers gathered at the station, who often cause disputes because the passengers in the car are crowded, and the ticket seller refuses to open the door. At the same time, in order to provide convenience to the citizens everywhere, two new routes, the 24th (connecting the British and French Concessions) and the 20th, were added after the war. How is the business on these two new routes? There is no need to examine the accounts in detail, the company authorities are always very clear.</p>
<p>Perhaps this increased income still cannot offset the losses on foreign exchange, and forces the company authorities to resort to raising fares, which may be possible. However, please forgive me for being long-winded, the tram is a public utility, and cannot be compared with second landlords and unscrupulous merchants. With such high living standards and the decline in the vitality of citizens' lives, the tram company should make overall calculations within the possible scope, on how to reduce unnecessary expenses, and block huge loopholes.</p>
<p>At the same time, those who take the tram are mostly people from the middle and lower classes. The fare increase is indeed a prerequisite for increasing income on the surface, but in reality, it may not be entirely the case. Let me give an example:</p>
<p>I once talked to a rickshaw puller about the "business" problem. According to him, the rickshaw business is far inferior to what it used to be, but the rice price has risen to more than forty, and the rickshaw price cannot be raised too much. For example, the distance that used to cost a dime, now at most can be bargained for one dime and five cents, any more, and you can't find a customer.</p>
<p>Everyone living on the "isolated island" cannot deny the truth of this statement. From this, it can be seen that many people can no longer afford to ride in a rickshaw. And this is not comparable to being hungry and being forced to snatch rice, our legs, walking a little more distance, is also its due obligation.</p>
<p>From this example, taking it a step further, after the tram fare increase, some people will inevitably also descend from the tram class to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Now the fare increase is a "fait accompli," but for the sake of the tram company authorities, please use this example as a memorandum, and in addition to the fare increase, please think about whether there are other ways to compensate for the "inability to balance income and expenditure."</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Forming a Family; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Skill in Pregnancy</p>
<p>According to the manufacturers of those family travel cars, "These cars can be equipped with heating in winter and air conditioning in summer, just like a person's house." Originally, these family travel cars were called "mobile homes," and they were considered a mobile family and a house. Since it's impossible to carry a house around everywhere, you can go wherever the car takes you. Furthermore, the curtains and carpets are all complete in every color. At the back of the car, there's a small platform. If there's a pair of lovers, sitting knee-to-knee, chatting intimately, watching flowers and appreciating the moon, it's the most suitable place. If the car is parked in an area of clear water and lush trees, a secluded and beautiful place, with beautiful flowers as walls and fragrant grass like carpets, wouldn't that evoke an indescribable joy? Since Jin Danyun had agreed to Mrs. Su Liya to test all three types of cars, then during this honeymoon, she planned to travel around the scenic areas near Shanghai. However, she didn't approve of some newlyweds who leave for their trip on the very night of their wedding, some even quietly leave without telling anyone where they're going, which is truly like running away. There's another matter. For that kind of family travel car, you can either ask the company to send a driver, or you can drive it yourself without a driver. Like Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun, they both know how to drive cars, but they've only driven cars for personal use. Driving such a large car, even if they both can, would be too tiring. To still be accustomed to labor during the honeymoon would be to lose the purpose of rest. Having the company send a driver would be best, but newlyweds inevitably lean on each other and whisper sweet nothings. According to Eastern customs and etiquette, they don't want to display overly intimate behavior in front of a third person. Moreover, perhaps lingering over the night view, a couple would stay in the car, as the travel car is equipped for this. But the driver would have to occupy it, otherwise, "How can one allow another to sleep soundly beside one's bed?" However, Jin Danyun had another idea. She said, "Since the test drive has been agreed upon with Mrs. Su Liya, I'm thinking of having some friends come along to travel and make it a public honeymoon trip. Then, let the company send a driver, and whoever is happy to drive can drive themselves." She also asked Lin Jiancheng, "Do you agree? Do you have any male friends to invite? If not, I'll invite my girlfriends." Lin Jiancheng always obeyed Jin Danyun, so he said, "I don't have any male friends, and it's meaningless to have a stranger come. It's best to invite girlfriends." Therefore, this matter was discussed before they got married. Her friend Wu Junsu's visit was for this very reason. (219)</p>
