<h3 id="c7">為英日談判吿英人 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>在日本極端威脅壓迫之下，召開所謂英日東京談判，我們想想，會有所謂好的結果麼？所以「屈辱的妥協」，畢竟要成為「實逼處此」的結果。照這幾天的情形看來，日本初步的要求，引渡東程案中的四華人嫌疑犯，便已經英國遷就屈服了。這在英本國一般公正的人士，都對之有所不滿；而在全世界主持正誼公道的人，自是更多責難；至於中國人站在受害人的立塲看來，其憤激的態度與觀感，當然又有所不同。</p>
<p>我們要知道英日東京談判的中心，都是一些關於處分中國的問題。在日本以强行佔領者的地位隨意處分，這總還有待於最後的淸算；至於第三國，在名實方面，都還正式承認中國獨立主權存在的，而居然違背現行條的，損害中國國權利益，作隨便處分的承諾，這在中國縱使抗議未收實際的效果，但對於在國際條約上負有信守義務的這樣國家，却不能不致其深切的遺憾。</p>
<p>在英國方面，也未嘗不知道她現行的遠東綏靖政策，是含着有「自己屈服，別人犧牲」的意味。不過她一方要為自己解嘲，保持假面具的尊嚴，來掩飾牠的醜惡現象，同時也還想對中國給一點物質上的小小安慰，藉買歡心。我想一般的中國人，不會對於英國這種用意也不明白：英國固然有她很完備的新聞宣傳綱，可以利用她來蒙蔽世人的耳目，來辯護她的遠東綏靖政策的必要，來說明她有不得已的情形，來解釋牠既不妨害中國的利權，也不損失英國的威望；但是身受其害的中國人可能貿然相信麼？所以現在英國還要用更進一步的掩飾政策，日來報載，香港政府竟禁止報載中國外交部關於英國擬將四華人嫌疑犯移交日方抗議的文字。這種想以一手掩盡天下人耳目的手段，我想中外人士都只有覺得牠的醜惡而可笑吧！</p>
<p>再說到她對於中國物質上的安慰手段，自然不外對華貸款，表示好意。但是我們一向知道英國對華貸款的數目，並不圖怎樣的大；便是決定了貸出的數目，也不會爽爽快快地拿出來：她却以此作為某種利益的交換條件，或作為某種宣傳的良好資料。這是英國一向拿手好戲；英國對於阿比西尼亞，對於捷克，一向都是這樣的做；自然對於中國，也難免不施用這種一貫的作風。她以為像這樣的斷送了中國的權益，只要貸給中國一筆款項，不也就可以抵消而表示好感麼？可是中國人畢竟還知道捷克亡了國以後，對於英國的貸款還不曾動用過呢。並且中國的國民，過去既沒有忘記英日海關協定斷送中國多少利權；自然這决也不會忘記英日東京談判，會給中國損害多少國權，减弱中國若干力量！中國人和英國民族一樣，也略能知打算！</p>
<p>一般的中國人為英國打算，覺得對日屈服妥協，便就英國的利益上說，也是太不値得。英國現在無非為着維持在中國淪陷區域內一點殘餘利益，便不惜自貶身價，在受盡日人種種侮辱脅迫以後，便拿中國的利益作犧牲，來作為維持英國一點殘餘利益的「交換」條件，這種由虎口裏暫時抓出的利益，能保得住長久麼？倘使英國認中國失敗，只有强權佔領之下可以維持的話，為甚麼東三省的英國利益曾被排斥凈盡呢？英國近視派的政治家，實在應該想想：在目下中國為民治主義前衛而戰的過程中，英國縱使損失一點物質上的利益，實際上又何關重要？何况等到中國勝利以後，以中國復興事業之需要大量資金物品，英國又何愁不能取償於將來？並且以中國之大，英國在淪陷區域稍為損失一點經濟利益算什麼；現在西南各省與英屬地經濟密切的關係，不是一天天在加速增進麼？英國即使為經濟上利益打算，又何嘗不可以失之束隅，收之桑榆？</p>
<p>再退一步說，英國所顧慮的，只是眼前的實利，而這些實利，因為都在中國淪陷區域，只有向日本屈服妥協才可取得。但是英國近視的政治家，可曾覺得僅僅為着淪陷區域內這樣一點殘餘的利益，便不惜喪失全中國國民的同情好意，這難道不有點得不償失麼？張伯倫總也明白今日淪陷區域反英運動，因為是受人發縱指示的，所以不足畏懼；但是一旦全中國的人民，為着英國一再對華惡意而引起的反響後果，這於英國，所失不更多麼？以英國目前對華態皮這樣暗味，在英日談判正在進行時，可以移交四嫌疑犯，將來也未始不可將天津英租界的有銀交出，甚至於租界中竟禁止法幣的流通，一如日人之所要求。那就難免不會因英國政府不公道的惡意政策而引起莫大的反響了。英國不乏眼光遠大主持正誼公道的人士，這時正宜急起對於英政府現行的遠東政策有所糾正，這不僅是為着維持中英歷來的友好關係，也實在是為英國人自已的眞正利益打算。懸崖勒馬，此正其時了。</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、本埠愛理思律師公館李克斯、上星期六日向英國駐華按察使署法官瓊思呈請發出天津英當局所扣四華籍恐怖嫌疑犯之保護人身法令狀、英按察使署今（十五日）晨加以審詢後、已有因是案性質重大、數日內不致加以判決之象、查星期六日之聽訟、始於晨間、午後續詢甚久、因天津所扣四人乃屬華人、不受英法庭之管轄、故法官瓊思決將是案熱加考慮、而於星期日整日及本週繼續對呈請作長久之研究、據所能確知者、四人尙未引渡予天津日當局、此舉或將展緩、以待上海英國按察使署加以判決、</p>
<p>此項呈請震驚當世</p>
<p>大陸報云、咋（十四日）悉、上星期六日向此間英國駐華按察使署所提對天津所扣四華人一案、發出保護人身法令狀之呈請、若遭駁回、則將上訴、如有必要、直至此案交英國樞密院而後已、查此項呈請、係本埠愛理思律師公館代表李克斯與瓊期兩氏、接倫敦愛爾惠爾律師事務所來電、而向法官瓊思提出者、巳引起舉世之關切、並使英國境內對英政府將四華人交日當局、然後由北平政權傀儡法院審問之決定、反對者激增、而達　人之最高點、</p>
<p>本案判决影響遠大</p>
<p>此項運動、在英國迅速集得反對政府之力量、領導此運動者為耶路撒冷大學國際法律敎授、前巴力斯坦檢察長邊持威、曁英國廣播公司董事佛蘭女士、邊敎授與佛女士委託倫敦愛爾惠爾律師事務所、而致電本埠愛理思律師公館、雖前已在英宣布邊敎授與佛女士將取法律行動、以抗政府之決定、然本埠愛理思律師公館、於上星期五日夜突接倫敦來電、直至十星期六日、始首次洩露法官瓊思已開庭審理是項呈請之消息、此案之判決、影響甚為遠大、故滬人士以為承審官宣判之前、必將商諸最高當局、但以事勢急迫、故判詞亦不致延擱也、</p>
<p>英國允准移交經過</p>
<p>查四華人係偽「海關監督」程鍚庚四月三日在天津某電影院中被刺斃命後、遭天津英當局拘禁者、雖前曾有一華人因有從事恐怖活動嫌疑、被天津英當局逮捕、調查竣事、即將其人移交日當局、然英方對被疑與刺程案有關而加逮捕之四華人、上週以前斷然拒不移交、堅主日方所提出之證據、並不確鑿、惟同意覊禁四人、以待繼續偵查、英方拒交四人之結果、日方乃作軍事封鎖、對迫不得巳而經過日方障碍物之英人、施以侮辱、克萊琪與日當局在東京進行之談判、乃英國欲解決問題之努力、上週杪、英政府卒訓令克萊琪同意交出四人、惟同時切言因英政府對日方所提出之證據認為滿意、故同意引渡、</p>
<p>正義人士大聲疾呼</p>
<p>英國報紙無論保守黨自由黨與社會黨、咸立即大聲疾呼、而反動運動已滋長至「使張伯倫政府大為侷促不安」（最近英倫來電所稱）之範圍、李克斯與瓊斯星期六日向法官瓊思呈請、要求對天津英租界警務處發出令狀、李瓊兩氏堅主僅被正當承認的中國法院始能審問四人、</p>
<p>華人安全所關至鉅</p>
<p>昨據本埠人士指稱、英按察使署此决判決、無論趨何途徑、其宣判必有遠大之結果、因其將決定中國境內外國租界當局所扣一切華人囚犯之身份也、同時、此間華人居民對呈請結果、表示至大之關切、此項消息雖刊布較遲、然傳布甚速、一般人均表示大為滿意、而希望按察使署之判決結果、、當有利於被覊之四人、惟恐所判若相反、則華人在任何租界區均不能認已身為安全矣、昨日本埠一般人相信按察使署或將於今（十五日）晨公布判决、</p>

<p>— 文琴</p>
<p>小菜塲點心攤巡禮（續完）</p>
<p>再過去是一家賣豆腐漿的攤基了，板凳上坐着一列顧客，其中最引人注目的是一位留着八字鬚兒的老先生半僂着身子和坐在身伴的小女孩合喝着碗豆腐漿，碗置在她的面前，他倆一面喝湯，一面吃着粢飯，好像津津有味，小女孩吃得很慢，老者手握着羹匙，欲下未下，那種老子愛子女的眞情，表露無遺。</p>
<p>這裏也有冷飮室，也算是別緻的一隅，這裏佈置得相當的淸雅，够得上鶴立鷄羣了。桌上舖着白布，板凳上舖着藍布凳衣，這凳衣和桌上的黃色碟子映成對比的顏色，頓覺眼前明亮起來。玻璃框子裹的價目表上可以看出，有衛生菉豆湯，百合湯，冰汽水等等的名目，而標着的價格也很克己。這時汽水架子的闊板上睡着一個赤膊壯漢，正在迴轉的打着鼾聲　然見之，不免　。道樣的配置，實在太不相稱了，好在此時還沒有顧客，讓他去追尋着糊塗的夢吧，我又忽忽的走了過去。</p>
<p>我還得一述最興隆的攤基了，牠的招牌，—一張貼在牆上的紅紙—名呌美味居，從吃客們的埋頭　嚼，與夫旁觀者的嚥着　述，就可以證明此牌名副其實了。攤面雖然很小，可是在無形中却也分着三個等級：靠街的板凳—坐着三個黃包車夫，他們的藍布衣服上背着號碼字，眞像開運動會時的運動員，不過數目很大，記得一個是九〇六七；橫裏板凳上坐着一列白色的吃客，最裏面的一端傍着一張小方板檯，端坐着一位戴着老光眼鏡的老先生，他是榮坐在高尙的雅座裏了。他們有的嚼着牛肉大麵，有的吃着陽春麵，有的怪悠閒的咪着高粱茄皮，價錢可並不貴，牛肉大麵九分一碗，陽春麵五分一碗，茄匣牛肉湯六分一碗，莊源大的菉荳燒六分一小盅，五茄皮八分，决酒也有五分一盅的。如果你不慕虛榮，喜歡講實惠，我願意介紹你去試吃一頓，假使不嫌麻煩，先到封面買就一團粢飯，再到這裏呌上一碗茄厘牛肉湯，或者加上些胡椒，或者酌上一盅菉荳燒，所費無幾，落得一個醉飽，眞是上算極丁。眼見那位老先生吃畢，捋着鬍子，長咳一聲，揚長而去，幾個苦力也拍了拍肚子，很精神的提着車槓走了。這裏的老闆周旋在各色的主顧間好像很樂意，但是，出乎意表的，他也染着了流行調兒了：「你不要瞧這裏的生意好，現在各樣東西漲價了，我們自己的吃能够挨過已經是很好了。」他露着滿心苦惱參半的笑容繼續的招待着顧客們，無論如何，在我看起來，他是暫時是不失為一個點心攤的倖運兒哩。</p>
<p>當然，其他還有藕粥，湯山芋，煎麵，前餛飩，粽子，圓子之類的點心，但觀乎前述的生活情形也不難料想到其他了。我在這裏徘徊了許久，好像引起了大家的注意，籃裏的大餅已冷，於是轉入菜塲，置身於喧囂的世界裏。</p>

<p>昨日外幣、難外匯微鬆、而烚赤午後突昂、收市後挺俏異常、英美金鎊由疲轉昂、英金鎊需要見增、市况上升、英美金票客戶吸收甚殷、美金票供給稀少、市况最俏、香港票隨匯票鬆動、略見下降、安南票需要已稀、市况回平、日金票尙堅、晚市為一元一角三分、朝鮮票供求呆滯、為九角四分、其他各幣穩定、無榮辱、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金鎊升五角、美金票升六角五分、香港票降二分、安南票降二角、其他各幣未更、</p>

<p>杜　梗來源河下共到四號、車輪包子一千三四百包、而蕪湖尖聞已有抵埠四五千包、故人心頓虛、而本街店胃自經前三朝一度轟動後、吃戶方面亦已備足、故店胃亦懈、乃市面遂難立足、計先後瀉落有一元半之譜、如高錫粳祇開二十七元半、中市貨開二十七元、蘇崑常州等粳開二十七元至二十六元半、南港早晚稻包子開二十六元、河下祇開二十五元二角至二十五元、高尖開二十四元半、市蕪尖開二十四元、中市二十三元半至二十三元、變元二十六元、香港糯二十七元、統市成交數不過三千四五百包、且視形勢以人心虛浮關係、再望其有步下之趨勢、</p>
<p>大　市場略鬆、影響一時不易及於門市、故昨日市售依然不鬆、擄人言、昨日買米、二十五允之米、碎雜不堪、二十七元之米、尙堪煮飯、然買不到米者仍不在少數、本報在先曾謂金融界應擔負間接抬高米價之責任、頗有人疑其不當、近來各晚報中關於米市記載、亦多以此為言、可見本報消息、皆有所據而云然、現下對於米價有幾種說法、有以為與其暗盤搗亂、不如明放限價、亦有謂應將限價放至二十五六元者、此說果行、囤戶滿載而返、金融界押款本利雙收、惟曙盤旣高至二十八九元、還是「倒拔蛇」、恐難打消暗盤、至於訂購洋米、辦理平糶、以平米價、無人不歡迎、惟値得考慮者、假如西貢米換算為上海市斛以越幣六元計算、叫元三角折合法幣已需十二五元八角、再加稅餉水脚等、巳與高粳暗盤相近、如欲平糶、決不能高於目前之限價、即照限價出售、每石貼補須六七元之數、升合所蝕、尙不在內、何况洋米之價每包須在三十七元（見另條」此大宗墊費從何而出、大批外匯平白費去、以及目前米糧實際情形、是吾已至非定洋米不可之地步、均須鄭重考慮、惟議定洋米、大可褫奸商囤戶之膽、使之出籠、以裕民食、未始非計、</p>
<p>囤　戶遝在隔岸觀火燒、大說風凉話、以為百物價貴、惟米獨賤、如照目前英金三便士半一元計算、現在之米價、即使售三十元、只及以前七元二角、（每元合英金一先令二便士半）之數、是以未饜所欲、此則誠所謂欲將土貨作洋貨論價也、</p>
<p>客秈　昨日巳有少數高機米由南京運到、且傳蕪湖首批四千多包亦已裝出、而後批搬運證十萬包亦將接洽成熟、因此人心安定、進戶胃口立懈、貨方難以扳俏、一部份客囤隨市貶晚、行情乃在瀉六七角至一元以上、高客仍開二十四元八角、中决別降較嚴云、</p>
<p>洋　米、外傳某方面已與洋行訂定一萬噸、價三十七元申鈔、運滬救濟市民、概照平價發售、倘係事實、亦民食前途之佳音、至於市塲新西貢售價仍喊三十二元、進戶因客秈回降、均乏問津之意、</p>

<p>麵粉　本街零銷活躍、且囤戶在市收買棧單者、亦不乏人、所以回籠貨反比廠盤為貴、外傳六元三四角之價者、殊難證實、昨聞回籠貨比廠盤提加一角至二角不等、廠盤則仍為六元現鈔、祗供本街、客盤依然不開、今日有麵粉一萬七千包運天津、</p>

<p>吾人之生活過程，必須經過由少而壯，由壯而老，任何賢愚貧富，、均跳不出此種必經之過程，則吾人之衰老，乃事實上所不可避者。惟一般人年齡未屆衰老之秋，而率已頭白種種，現龍鍾狀態，此種未老先衰之象，確可用現代科學之方法加以治愈而挽救之，此科學上不能顚破之眞理也。而世謂有返老還童者，實乃欺人妄說。不値識者一笑也。</p>
<p>不過吾人現代科學進步之階段，巳能使一般未老先衰之病家，用科學方法，為之挽救，且業已獲到美滿之成功。此事首先成功者，為德國梅倫博士所發明之靑春腺製劑「補體康」。諸君要知人之靑春腺，乃人生保待靑春時代必須之重要機能，如此靑春腺機能健全，則吾人在靑春期內，將維持於不敗之地。惟一般人大多不能有此好涵養之工夫，而往往於未發育之前，濫施手淫，早婚，房事過度，及用功讀書過度，缺乏呼吸新鮮，憂愁過度，均能障礙靑春腺之發育，而如初發奇葩，遽爾萎謝。此一般人所以有未老先衰之象也。惟今日旣有靑春腺製劑「補體康」一藥，足資挽救，奧大利台維斯博士，曾於維也納內分泌學院中，作實地試騐，會治愈一年甘五歲之靑年，肌肉鬆弛，皮膚皺摺，面現龍鍾狀態，望之恰如五六十歲之人，該靑年並且心悸健忘，腰足酸痛，頭目昏暈，不僅表面上露老態，即精神方面，亦完全成為一個暮氣沉沉之老人，乃服用「補體康」未及三星期，面色紅潤結實，精神活潑，完全恢復健全時之靑年典型云。</p>

<h3 id="c120">僱一個女傭的支出 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— （西蒙）</p>
<p>一個每月工資五元的女傭　飯食及其他將達二十餘元</p>
<p>最近，上海的生活程度眞是高得嚇人，什麼東西都漫無限制的上漲，允其是食米，一斛已抵兩斛的售價而有餘，本來，家裹僱着一個女傭，倒也不覺得什麼，米貴了，就要想到僱一個女傭要支出多少錢。過往，五元一月的工資，大概冉加五元一月的飯食，多支出十元是够了，可是現在，至少再要加上一倍。</p>
<p>上一個月，舊的女傭是走了，喊一個新的來。薦頭錢，速送錢，保單錢等，差不多用去二元，工資是每月五元。可是出乎意外，這女傭的肚皮特別大，一頓飯要吃三大碗。她一個人的食量，抵我全家五人（二大三小）的食量，完全一樣。換句話說，每天的食米，供給她一人吃的要佔一半，喊一斛米來祇吃二十一天，開了我們自從組織家庭以來的食米新紀錄。米價是甘元一担，一個月吃掉一斛半（七斗五升）米，是十五元，她所吃的値七元半，然而用了人又不能嫌飯吃得多，祗是背後和妻子倆在咋舌而巳。</p>
<p>雖然有一個女傭，不必添菜，其實素菜是要多一碗的，吾則就不够吃。現在的素菜，等於以前的葷菜價錢，至少一個月也要多費二三塊錢。因此，僱一個女傭，工資，飯食，連馬頭錢，我上個月一共支出了十六七塊錢，而且敎她去買菜，買東西，什麼都要揩油，現在銅允是沒有了，油不揩就算，要揩起碼要幾分，剛做一個月，在我們，嫌她吃飯嚇人；在她嫌我們的門頭小，油水揩不足。在兩不滿意之下，是解僱了。</p>
<p>生活的鞭子在不留情的加重壓迫，戰後，我們就什麼都實行節的，不應用的錢委實不用，現在，的確巳不能再减省。和妻子倆商酌之下，祇有自己動手，省僱一個女傭，可節省十多塊錢。洗衣服，倒馬桶，喊了一個散走的女僕，每月的代價是叫元，其他的工作，就什麼都可自己動手，雖然大家忙得不能停手，但是要省錢，度過這嚴重的時代，原是沒有法想，人天然是要勞動的。</p>
<p>所以自本月起，我們就實行自己動手，不僱女條。事後，實騐的結果，叉發現到不僱女傭，不但省工資飯食，就共他的日用物品，也可省不少。譬如煤球，女傭一個月要燒兩担，我們自已燒，一担能够用二十一天。其他如鹽醬，肥皂，草紙，都可節省些。你想現在的物價是多麼貴，所以省僱一個女傭，至少可省二十元錢。在這生活為難的常兒，敢把我們的實騐，報告給想節的的主婦們。</p>

<p>— 素臣</p>
<p>賴債不如賴人情</p>
<p>每天到寫字間裏，當目光接觸到寫字檯上的文件和書信的時候，我常常恐懼着在這一堆東西中間，發現觸目驚心的紅白帖子。在過去，我也曾望着那紅色的笑顏而猜想它將報告我那一個朋友的喜訊；望着白色恐怖而需不幸的朋友們歎息，可是現在，我祇是靜靜地注意着它，不論白色或紅色，它帶給我的是恐懼和驚悸！</p>
<p>人自然不能離羣而居的，而友朋之間的酬酢，禮尙往來，也是平常得很。可是，現在這代表着友誼的媒介物，己經超過了它的本份，有的是作為諂媚上峯的機會，有的是藉此打一筆秋風，……我曾經在一份白色帖子上，找遍了下面孤哀子等七八行的列名內，沒有一個相熟的名字，即使我的記憶力太壞，忘了在某一塲合中接過了一張初會面者的名片，然而他這名宇旣不在我的腦膜上留着一點印象，我們似乎也不必多此一層關係的。</p>
<p>在追生活程度高得嚇人的時期，一個薪給階級者的痛苦是甚於一切的，因為四五十元的收入，維持一家的生活，已經苦不堪言，而所謂「長衫階級」的面子問題却又不得不裝着笑顏敷衍，這「兇於債」的紅白帖子怎不使人觸目驚心呢！</p>
<p>愛排塲的積習到現在還不能廢除，實在是呌人寒心，富有者果然不在乎這幾個錢（但為什麽不化在其他正當的用途上呢），貧窮者的舉債撑塲面，眞是何苦？時至今日，不但婚喪喜慶要發帖子，六十冥壽，三十初度，也一樣排塲，每天望着寫字檯上道些如雪片飛來的東西，終於逼着我喊出了本文的題目「不送禮運動」！</p>
<p>愛出風頭的朋友誚耐性等過一個時期，沒有錢的還請注意一下床底下的米變，打秋風的也請易地以處，想想現在大家過着什麼日子，祇要沒有帖子飛來，「不送禮運動」其實也不成其為「運動」的。</p>

<p>— 英磊</p>
<p>自海關採取了不用巳婚女子的政策以後，由於這一政策的不合理，由於其他機關錄用已婚女子並無不便的經騐，所以已婚女子在今天，還不致在海關以外，無路可走。但最近風聞上海郵政儲金滙業局也要媲美海關，採行不用已婚女子政策了，這倒是値得廣泛討論的問題。</p>
<p>女職員在儲金匯業局，數月上據說是七八十人，職務上通常是淸理勾稽滙票。巳婚和未婚的白分比，雖然沒有正確的統計，假如說，各佔百分之五十，似乎未必甚遠。因此，假如該局以後果不再錄用太太們了，而目即使是小姐，在結婚即滾蛋的鐵則以下，你要顧全飯碗，就不得結婚，這一威脅，於女子職業前途，確是個嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>好的，政策是海關創導於前，儲滙局發揚於後，於是婦女們為了謀得職業，就非獨身，做不嫁的北宮要不可。因為結婚即失業，所以，為了保證職業的安全，就不得不視結婚為畏途，因而，寫字聞中，將養成大批的老處女。</p>
<p>職業是終身的，於是你就嫁給職業，這辦法合理嗎？這一措施合於坐理現象嗎？我們不得不指出這是逮反人道的行為！</p>
<p>至於工作效能，則已婚有未婚女子能力的差別如何？女子在結婚前工作能力假如是强的，則結婚後，是不是就會大遜於前，不堪任用？如果由於過度繁重工作的原因，以致於損害健康，時時乞假，則工作效能的强弱，自始與結婚無關。而且因為社會生事日繁，生計日迫，為了减輕家庭擔負計，已婚女子對職業的需要，比未婚女子為切，這是個事實問題，並不是在辦公室中，點綴幾位年靑不嫁的小姐，就算是解決女子職業問題了。</p>
<p>爲了確立社會上婦女職業的基礎，為了配合大時代中婦女動員的任務，為了爭取婦職地位人道的保障，這一問題，我想是不論已婚未婚的姊妹們，應該一致起來力爭的！</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豔聞忽迎桃葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>原來何先生的這位繼配夫人，她的血胤中，還帶着一半是白種人的。因為何先生的那位岳丈，是中國人，而何先生的那位岳母，劫是法蘭西人。何先生的那位岳丈姓成，在那時也是中國一位名士呢。何先坐的那位岳丈，娶他的那位岳母，其中還有一段可歌可泣的佳話，我不妨趁此略說一說。目說何先生的岳丈成先生，單名一個功字，原籍是個廣西人。他在國內也是一個高才生，但家計却不甚豐浴。後來他却留學法國去了，當時中國學生留學法國的很多，有什麼勤工儉學的名目標榜着。但這位成功先生，雖然不在法國做什嚒勞東的工作，對於學問上，但是能實踐這個勤字的。他是在里昂大學裹肄業的，也就住在里昂那個地方。法國是一個自由的國度，允其在男女交際之間，不像中國從前，好似靑年男女，不能見面，一見面就要出毛病似的。他們在學校裏，男女學生一向是自由慣的，可以一同出游，可以互相往來。要是在範圍以內，他們或她們的父母，也一聽其自由。那時學校中，有一位女學生，她的名字喚作愛麗絲。愛麗絲生得肌同玉潔，貌比花妍，年紀也小過十八九歲，姿色却為校中之冠。那時所有大學校中的學生，沒有一個不知道愛麗絲楚他們學校中的皇后的。但愛麗絲却是艷如桃李，冷若冰霜，實在她也不得不如比，因為追求她的人，實在太多了。而且那個大學裏，不但是本國人，各國的學生都有。還有各國的什麼爵士之子，貴旅的子弟，王孫公子，充塞其中。都願意向愛麗絲獻個殷勤，得嫌嫣然笑，眞是個莫大的榮光。講到愛麗絲呢？她的門閥也並不低微，她的祖先，跟着拿破崙出征，很建立些軍功，也是一位爵爺家的後裔。不過到了現在，家世不免中落了。她的父親早已故世，她的母親，只生下一男一女，女的便是愛麗絲，男的是她的一位弟弟，此刻不過十四五歲，在中學生時代。幸而却傳下一些遺產，她的母親，倒是有些幹才，頓能待家。母子三人，融融洩洩，一個和美的家庭，而且也算是個中上小康之家咧。（一七〇）</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>溜冰皇后宋雅海妮，新近發生一幕緊張的失戀悲劇，她表示非常沉痛。據好埡塢情報所記，她的意中人是德箱男星以漂亮著名的狄羅鮑華，兩人合演多片，感情很洽，月前當宋雅海妮正向他表示熱烈的時候，狄羅鮑華也向報上發表特別談話，大槪說：一我所佩服之女性，絕非追蹤我左右庸庸碌碌之輩，要為偉大莊嚴者，舉世僅得十人。若中國女界領袖蔣介石夫人，主持大計，勞苦功高，令我敬服。……又若溜冰女明星宋雅海妮，旣有高尙品格，復又多才多藝，余亦傾倒。」宋雅海妮聞訊，體育場下竊喜。料不到這是一個烟幕彈，兩星期後，狄羅鮑忽然與另一紅星安妮倍拉締婚，一聲不響，出發渡蜜月旅行而去。</p>
<p>宋雅海妮一氣之下，痛哭失聲而傷心萬分。她年已廿九，初度戀愛就遭遇一個重大剌激，朋友們都替她愼憒不平，有人說她十七年來在運動塲上保持「百勝將軍」的雅號，如何在戀愛塲合就不堪一繫。據她母親講，失戀後她有好幾個禫拜如痴如呆，鬰鬰不歡的，直到最近纔回復常態，說是已有了兩個候補的情人，一為英國電影經紀人，一為劍橋大學靑年飛行家。但她秘而不宣，有向她探索婚烟問題，是不是學葛萊泰寶保持神秘的，她必忸怩答道：「我沒有功夫結婚，我的事情太忙了。隨便怎樣我現在還找不到對手呢。」</p>

<p>— 劉慕耘</p>
<p>名票南鐵生來滬，伶票兩界的歡宴，幾乎使他不容易分身，前夜海上閏秀女票沈元豫，特假西愛咸斯路的本寓，歡宴南鐵生，　並且請了不少的名伶作陪，這是一個盛會，特地報吿本界。沈元豫小姐，是海上的名閏秀，對戲劇都有相當的研究，皮黃與崑曲不擋，文的與武的也都不弱，海上不少女票女，像她這校努力於戲的，確實少。數她每天的時間，都支配在戲劇圈裏，上午練功，下午吊嗓練功是劉君麟藝員，吊嗓是琴師夏馥苞，說戲的是名伶芙蓉草，崑腔是許百遵先生敎授，所以她的成績，會超然的在一般女票之上。這夜所請的，除掉南鐵生以外，有芙蓉夫婦，許百遵先生，徐寅聲先生，及坤伶謝雯琴小姐，正是「江南英傑士，相聚在沈府，」所以盛况不是節墨所能形容的了。</p>
<p>沈小姐精於攝影術，圖片都是她所拍的，可以說精彩備至，因為南鐵生　最近即將北返，所以這夜就是歡送，大家都很痛快。謝雯琴小姐對沈二小姐的藝術，素來景仰，尤其很顯得親密，她也是很努力於戲的，過去曾經向王蕙芳先生領敎，因為時間倉促，學戲不多，鐵生預備將來為她介紹王瑤靑先生，如果九月，瑤靑和鐵生同業，這計劃便可以馬上實行。現在她正向劉菊襌先生領敎，比較，她在南方坤伶中，而是欽慕北方玩藝的角兒。</p>
<p>最後的報吿，是南鐵生的行動，他已經有所決定了，如果義務戲能够二十五日以前决定，唱是沒有問題的了，假使在二十五日以後，也許等到九月間吧！</p>
<h3 id="c128">「理想夫人」改編的經過（上） <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 孫樟</p>
<p>是今年四月的時候，一新演劇社一剛剛成立，本來預備首次公演魯迅先生的遺著「阿Q正傳一，但因為演員人數過多，以非職業劇團招集演員排戲之困難，及劇本審查等等問題，短期間不及演出。於是在幾位熱心的友人鼓勵之下，才改編了這個「理想夫人」，凖備作「新演」的頭一砲，那時導演是岳楓先生，前後排演過幾次，又因岳楓先生在「新華公司」拍戲，無暇顧及，致中途又停擱下來。</p>
<p>說起「理想夫人」，就使我回憶起四五年前，在徐家滙「聯華」總廠，那時工作開暇的時候，幾乎整日都埋首在書堆中，過着廢腰忘食，如醉如痴的生活。記得那時最使我沉醉除了I.Duncan的曰傳O.Mlirbeau的幾部戲劇名著之外，就是莫氏這部「L’Ecole　Des　Fennnes」了「L’Ecole　Des　Femmes」雖然是十六世紀的法國作品，然而以全劇的內容說來，它非但絲毫沒有失去其時間性，並且針對着目前所謂東方的小巴黎——上海。</p>
<p>當時我就懷了改編的野心，同時也動手寫了幾頁，但當我捧着這幾頁稿紙去拜望了幾位同好的朋友時，却被他們一盆冷水潑下來，說「中國沒有安納福這一型的人」！</p>
<p>在現在重新整理舊稿的時候，我把安納福的身份和環境改變了一下，我把他寫成一個鍍過金而不滿於歐美的離婚結婚，以及祇重愛情不重貞操的結合，而且他也是一位在情塲上老打敗仗的人，這樣；我以為比較更接近國情一點。</p>
<p>我强調了葛丹的性格，把他寫成一個見解相當透澈的人。在第二幕裏，我增加了他對安納福不少的對話。安對於結婚是主張「挑的，葛是主張一戀」的。安說他在外國信了不少年數，見人家打的離婚官司，也不知道有多少，這都是一戀」的好結果。在這裏，葛旦暴露出「戀愛式婚姻」失敗之原由，是由於在戀愛的其初，雙方總是把自己的美點特別的顯示出來，把劣點都隠藏着，在這愛得迷迷糊糊時候結了婚，日子一久，劣點暴露了，離婚當然就跟着來了。</p>
<p>同時；他對那些不放心太太的先生們：「一個人有了太太，而不放心太太，只有用全心全身全力去愛太太，「愛是勝過一切魔難的法實！」所以他是勝利的，他用不着思前慮後。</p>
<p>在這個喜劇裏，包含了一點悲劇的成份，，阿妮的母親是封制度下婚姻的犧牲品，他和阿妮的父親秘密結合，而為當時社會所不允，才會把這個私生子寄養在鄕下，生離死別，致丈夫流亡到海外去。我想凡是在舊式婚姻下受過打擊的人，都有切膚之感吧！</p>
<p>這裏還可以看到，是人性的不可泯滅，阿妮由她母親先天的傳統，刀子聰明，她有反抗的力量，雖然安納福千方百計的想把她弄成愚蠢，然而她一片天然的戀質，終久會顯露出來。</p>

<h3 id="c129">「陳查禮自白」（下） <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 徐莘園</p>
<p>—拍演偵探片的感想</p>
<p>其實我認為陳查禮不過是小說裏的福爾摩斯一樣，並沒怎樣一定典型的，我就扮得像，並不是像陳查禮，是像華納夏能，就是在美國，繼華納之後的雪泥託勒，一舉一動，他都是摹信華納的表情。總而言之，我們中國人，拍中國偵探影片，應該為中國的陳查禮表得精神振作一點才好。這次新華公司攝製陳查禮第二探案「蘭的飛屍」，我的化裝是同華納一樣，動作表情，是較前改得敏捷一點了。這部戲的劇情，比較「珍珠衫」來得現實而緊張，經過徐欣夫導演幾個月的心血，才成立這個遽本。偵探劇本的確是比任何劇本難編，尤其是中國的偵探故事，極難構造；旣不能涉及神怪迷信，又不能近於虛無縹渺。編偵探劇的要素，第一是欵疤瘌要多，使人難以捉摸；第二是伏綫佈局，交代淸；第三是空氣緊張，使人提心吊胆；第四是劇情現實，免除荒謬胡鬧，有此數端才合乎偵探劇的條件，至於演員的成績優劣，一平是靠劇本好，一半是靠在導演的手腕；偵探戲導演，極不容易當，胆要大心要細，每一個鏡頭，每一句對白，都是與金劇有着重大關係的。所以中國的偵探導演，除徐欣夫先生之外，却不多見，可見導演偵探戲比導演其他的片子難得多，其次演員的成功與失敗，多半都在導演手裏，例如攝拍一個鏡頭，自己覺得表演不够，而導演認為OK，或者某一塲戲，演員自己覺得很好，而導演却認為NG，都得服從指揮，自己不該多作主張。所以一個演員的成功，自己是很少把握的。我這部第二部偵探戲『蘭閨飛屍』，現已拍了五分之四，還有一塲最高潮，最緊張的全武行打戲，日內就要動手，預計在金風送爽，丹桂飄得的時候，就要與諸位相見了；還希望各界士女，至時多多賜敎是幸。</p>

<p>在風傳某公司有攝製「狸貓換太子」之企圖後，又風傳有人擬將「火燒紅蓮寺」重攝有聲片，所惜胡蝶在港納福，鄭小秋胖得一團和氣，夏佩珍又骨瘦如柴，而現在膠片更貴得駭人，希望打算盤朋友三復思之！</p>
<p>吳曉邦早有意香港之行，最近脫離中法後，更決意離滬，並有人已去函請歐陽予倩照料一切，看來「木蘭從軍」的歌舞或許要給香港寓公先看到了。</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to military news received here today, the Chinese army in northwestern Jiangxi province is currently advancing along the Gao'an, Fengxin, and Jing'an lines toward Japanese positions on the north bank of the Jin River. The Chinese army on the north bank has already retaken Yujia Ferry and advanced to Houtianji. Simultaneously, the second route of the Chinese army, northeast of Gao'an, has reached Zaoshi (transliteration), and the third route of the Chinese army is currently advancing toward Fengxin, having reached a certain point south of Fengxin. Another route of the Chinese army north of Jing'an plans to cut off the highway between Jing'an and Anyi. It is reported that the Chinese army has been attacking various points along the West River in Jiangxi province since August 11th. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Well-informed sources predict that a large-scale war will soon occur west of Hankou, with the Chinese army advancing along the north bank of the Yangtze River. This afternoon, a Chinese military spokesperson told a Reuters reporter that the Chinese army in Shanxi province is currently attacking Japanese forces advancing from the east and northwest, attempting to seize southeastern Shanxi province.

<p>(Chongqing) Military spokespersons here and foreign military observers all believe that it is absolutely impossible for the Japanese forces in central Hubei to advance. According to a Chinese military spokesperson, the fighting in Qianjiang, west of the Hanshui River, is extremely fierce, and a Japanese battalion commander has been reported killed in action. Daily artillery battles occur between Chinese and Japanese forces in the Luohan Temple and Shayang areas. Furthermore, the Japanese plan to advance northward along the Pinghan Railway from Xinyang has been hindered by the Chinese army's recapture of Minggang and forced to retreat southward. In order to relieve the pressure from the Chinese army on the Pinghan Line, the Japanese forces once attacked the left flank of the Chinese army west of the Pinghan Line, capturing places like Gucheng and Lishan. However, this route of Japanese forces was intercepted by the Chinese army south of Zaoyang and ambushed from the north by the Chinese army from Tongbai. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Chinese army if they penetrated too deep into the country, they retreated again. Consequently, Gucheng and Lishan were retaken by the Chinese army. Furthermore, according to military news from Shanxi province today, the Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi is currently launching a general counter-offensive against the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces on the Yicheng-Qinshui highway have been cleared by the Chinese army.

The Japanese forces retreated in a panic, and the Chinese army pursued their victory, reaching the vicinity of Shengmi Street by noon on the 13th. The remaining Japanese forces stubbornly resisted in the Houtian sock factory (south of Shengmi Street), which they had occupied.

<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese Youth Journalists Association expressed its admiration for the Hong Kong branch of the association, the entire body of newspaper vendors, and all workers of the Nan Hua and Tian Yan newspapers for suspending publication in support of the strike, and hoped that they would continue their efforts and fight to the end, and was willing to lead the members of the association across the country to express their support.

<p>(Chongqing) According to news from here today, the Central Gold Mining Bureau is currently planning a large-scale gold mining project.

The Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association has now allocated one million yuan to organize a gold mine exploration cooperative. The gold mined will belong to the government, but the workers of the cooperative will all be able to share the profits. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">A Word to the British People Regarding the British-Japanese Negotiations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Under the extreme threat and pressure from Japan, the so-called British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations were convened. Can we imagine that there will be any good results? Therefore, a "humiliating compromise" will ultimately become the result of "being forced into this situation." Judging from the situation in the past few days, Japan's initial demand, the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Dongcheng case, has already been accommodated and yielded to by the British. This has caused dissatisfaction among fair-minded people in Britain itself, and there is even more condemnation from those who uphold justice and fairness around the world. As for the Chinese people, standing from the perspective of the victims, their indignant attitude and feelings are, of course, different again.</p>
<p>We must understand that the focus of the British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations is on issues regarding the disposition of China. Japan arbitrarily disposes of China in its position as a forceful occupier, but this will ultimately await a final reckoning. As for a third country, which still formally recognizes the existence of China's independent sovereignty in name and in fact, it actually violates existing treaties, damages China's national rights and interests, and makes promises of arbitrary disposition. Even if China's protests have not achieved practical results, we cannot but express our deep regret to such a country, which has an obligation to uphold international treaties.</p>
<p>On the British side, they are also not unaware that their current policy of appeasement in the Far East contains the implication of "self-submission, others' sacrifice." However, on the one hand, they want to find excuses for themselves, maintain the dignity of a false front, to conceal their ugly phenomenon, and at the same time they still want to give China a little material comfort to gain favor. I think the general Chinese people will not fail to understand the British intentions. Britain has a very complete news propaganda network, which it can use to deceive the eyes and ears of the world, to defend the necessity of its Far Eastern appeasement policy, to explain its helpless situation, and to explain that it neither harms China's rights and interests nor loses Britain's prestige. But can the Chinese people who have suffered so believe it rashly? Therefore, now Britain still wants to use more advanced masking policies. According to recent reports, the Hong Kong government has even prohibited the publication of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' text protesting against the British intention to hand over the four Chinese suspects to the Japanese side. This kind of attempt to cover up the ears and eyes of the people all over the world, I think both Chinese and foreigners can only find it ugly and ridiculous!</p>
<p>Speaking of their means of material consolation to China, naturally it is nothing more than loans to China, expressing goodwill. But we have always known that the amount of British loans to China is not intended to be very large; even if the amount to be lent is decided, it will not be released quickly and easily. Instead, they use it as a condition for exchanging certain interests, or as good material for certain propaganda. This is a trick that Britain has always been good at. Britain has always done this to Abyssinia and Czechoslovakia; naturally, it is inevitable that it will also use this consistent style on China. They think that if they give China a loan after sacrificing China's rights and interests like this, can't it be offset and express goodwill? But the Chinese people still know that after Czechoslovakia lost its country, the loan from Britain was never used. Moreover, the Chinese people have not forgotten how many rights and interests China lost due to the British-Japanese customs agreement in the past. Naturally, they will never forget how much national power and strength China will be damaged and weakened by the British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations! The Chinese people, like the British, also know how to calculate!</p>
<p>The general Chinese people are calculating for Britain and feel that surrendering and compromising to Japan is too unworthy even in terms of Britain's own interests. Britain is now simply trying to maintain a little residual interest in the occupied areas of China and does not hesitate to demean itself. After suffering all kinds of insults and coercion from the Japanese, it sacrifices China's interests as a "quid pro quo" to maintain a little residual interest for Britain. Can these interests temporarily grabbed from the tiger's mouth be maintained for a long time? If Britain believes that China will fail and that it can only be maintained under the occupation of the strong, why has the British interest in the three northeastern provinces been completely excluded? Short-sighted British politicians should really think about it: In the current process of China fighting as the vanguard of democracy, what does it really matter if Britain loses a little material interest? Moreover, when China wins, with the needs of China's reconstruction career requiring a large amount of funds and materials, why should Britain worry about not being able to recover it in the future? Moreover, given the size of China, what does it matter that Britain has lost a little economic interest in the occupied areas? Isn't the close economic relationship between the southwestern provinces and British territories accelerating day by day? Even if Britain is planning for economic interests, how can it not be possible to lose in the east and gain in the west?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, what Britain is concerned about is only immediate practical benefits, and these practical benefits, because they are all in the occupied areas of China, can only be obtained by surrendering and compromising to Japan. But short-sighted British politicians, have they ever felt that just for the sake of such a little residual interest in the occupied areas, they do not hesitate to lose the sympathy and goodwill of the entire Chinese people. Isn't this a bit of a gain outweighs the loss? Chamberlain also understands that the current anti-British movement in the occupied areas is not to be feared because it is instigated and directed by others; but once all the Chinese people, because of Britain's repeated maliciousness towards China, cause a backlash, wouldn't Britain lose even more? With Britain's current ambiguous attitude towards China, the four suspects can be handed over while the British-Japanese negotiations are underway, and in the future, it may not be impossible to hand over the silver stored in the British concession in Tianjin, or even to prohibit the circulation of legal currency in the concession, as the Japanese demand. That would inevitably cause a great backlash due to the unfair and malicious policies of the British government. Britain is not without people with vision who uphold justice and fairness. At this time, it is appropriate to quickly correct the British government's current Far East policy. This is not only for the sake of maintaining the friendly relations between China and Britain throughout history, but also for the true interests of the British people themselves. Rein in at the precipice, now is the time.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The news that Roger, a reliable member of the Financial Committee here, has had important talks with Chinese bankers is unfounded. It is said that nothing can be achieved at the moment, at least until the results of the Tokyo British-Japanese conference are finalized before this matter can be carried out. As for Finance Secretary Xu Kan's visit to Hong Kong, it is only to handle routine matters. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British-Japanese negotiations are actually dormant, but they may be reopened due to the consultation between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Chief Representative Kato. In the next few days, there is unlikely to be any major development, especially regarding economic demands, because everything must wait until the instructions from the London government arrive before a decision can be made. These instructions may be delayed until the Chairman of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee, Roger, and Chinese bankers in Hong Kong have discussed ways to deal with the depreciation of Chinese legal currency and obtained results. Regarding this, it is heard that the Japanese financial community believes that China and Britain may not obtain Japanese understanding and agree on a plan to implement a new Chinese currency. Because Japan has now adopted an independent monetary system to cope with the new situation in Asia, it believes that this plan is not permissible. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" published an article today saying that various steps to prevent the Japanese side from obtaining foreign currency have been ineffective. Now, using a merely legal method to prevent new plans will not have any effect. It is permissible if the legal currency can be exchanged for a new currency, "Asahi Shimbun" said that the depreciation of Chinese legal currency has greatly affected customs revenue, so Japanese government experts, in view of the significant losses suffered, believe that they cannot continue to allow customs duties to be paid in legal currency. They have agreed that in the future, customs duties must be collected in commercial bank paper money, permitting this because it is now difficult to exchange legal currency for foreign currency.

<p>(London) Last night, the British government believed that although the representative of the Japanese army in North China had left Tokyo and returned to Tianjin, the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo would continue. A government spokesperson here denied the newspaper's claim that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie had agreed to discuss financial and economic issues with Japan at the same time as contacting the issue of police power in the British concession in Tianjin. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" claimed that we should be very reserved about the news from Tokyo that British Ambassador Craigie had notified the Japanese government that the instructions he was now waiting for would allow him to discuss economic and security issues. As far as the current situation is concerned, broader issues involving other countries may not be resolved in the near future. There is currently no reason to believe that the negotiations currently underway with other countries can reach a compromise due to any major concessions made by countries regarding Japan's demands. London may still need several days to negotiate a resolution. According to the "Times" report, the rumors that the British side is now considering a compromise solution to the issue of silver storage can be realistically acknowledged.

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwata reported on the low value of Chinese legal currency at the cabinet meeting this morning, saying that Chinese legal currency is still low. It is heard that related financiers are currently in Hong Kong planning a new currency policy for the Chinese government, but detailed information has not yet been obtained regarding this statement. Even if there is an attempt to implement a new currency policy, this attempt will definitely not succeed without Japanese cooperation. The Japanese government is currently carefully studying a new currency policy that can be applied to the entire territory of China, Foreign Minister Arita continued to explain the current situation of the British-Japanese roundtable conference, saying that since July 31, the conference has not continued to open, but judging from the conversation between the Japanese Chief Representative Kato and British Ambassador Craigie yesterday, Britain seems to be changing its attitude of opposing Japan's policies, so he hopes that the British-Japanese roundtable conference may be reopened shortly.

<p>(Chongqing) This morning, the "Central Daily News" published an article entitled "Will the Tokyo Conference Succeed After the British Government Decides to Extradite the Four Suspects in Tianjin?" It stated that the British government's decision has no legitimate reason in law or morality. If Britain faithfully adheres to its repeated guarantees, then even if the four suspects are handed over, the Tokyo conference will not be a success. The newspaper clearly stated that the British government's decision is completely inconsistent with the traditional fairness of Britain. If Japan can include monetary and silver storage matters in issues that affect the maintenance of peace and order in the Far East, then it may demand the British concession in Tianjin and Hong Kong. The newspaper also called on Britain to pay attention, saying that the British Empire is not only built on armed forces, but is even more based on prestige and integrity. If Britain is succumbed to Japan's military force, then its prestige and integrity will be completely destroyed by Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

In the daily massacres in the Far East, their execution will cause very little shock. Does London imagine that this ridiculous concession will reduce Japan's aggression and momentarily stop the demands it will issue and the ultimatum it will announce?

The Lieutenant Colonel is scheduled to go to Tokyo to take office in October this year. Diplomatic circles here have commented on this matter, saying that Britain’s attitude towards Japan will not become “substantially tougher” as a result. Major General Bigood’s retirement is a routine matter and not a reprimand. However, Lieutenant Colonel Murray is known for his fortitude and has no “preconceived notions” of favoring Japan in his policies.

<p>(Berlin) Following meetings between Italy and Germany in Berchtesgaden and Salzburg, senior Nazi officials said today that the Danzig issue could be resolved peacefully through international negotiations. The semi-official "Diplomatic and Political Newspaper" confirmed the possibility of such international negotiations. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Diplomatic activities here have been frequent in the past few days, indicating that the situation in Danzig has become tense. British Ambassador Sir Kennard met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck yesterday. After a while, French Ambassador Noel also met with the Polish Foreign Minister. US Ambassador Biddle visited the Polish Foreign Minister the day before. The content of the talks is still unknown, but it is generally speculated that it is the final stage of reviewing the Danzig dispute. The Polish Foreign Minister also received Bishop Rensiwo yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although there is no apparent basis for rumors that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano presented a peace plan to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to resolve the Danzig dispute, from the perspective here, the international situation has become slightly more optimistic. Although the newspapers still arbitrarily insist that the Axis powers should consolidate their strength to solve the relevant problems between the two countries, the tone is not as threatening as on Sunday, and they recognize that a peaceful solution is technically possible. However, officials are more reticent than usual. The details of the resolutions in Berchtesgaden have not been revealed. Most newspapers are eager to say that the Danzig issue is the first issue under discussion, but only as part of a general revision method. The Posen News summarized the situation after the Salzburg meeting, saying, "There is no dispute between Germany and Britain and France that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. The Danzig issue is not related to Poland's independence. Germany is determined to resolve the Danzig issue, and when the time comes, it has the power to do so. If forced to use this power, it will naturally exert it." Rumors of a compromise plan to resolve the Danzig issue contain six points, namely (1) abolishing the League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig; (2) revising the regulations of the Free City of Danzig, using only Germans as administrators; (3) gradually eliminating the customs borders between Danzig and Germany over a period of five years; (4) Germany guarantees the demilitarization of Danzig with international conventions, etc. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Burckhardt, at the invitation of the German government, went to Berchtesgaden over the weekend to meet with Hitler. Before his departure, Burckhardt notified the British government of this matter. All reports here indicate that Hitler has submitted his demands regarding Danzig to Burckhardt. These demands were agreed upon during Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's meeting with Hitler last week. Reliable sources said that Burckhardt must have informed Hitler, "If Germany invades Danzig, the Anglo-Polish military alliance will take effect immediately. If Germany voluntarily stops its aggression and threats of force, the path to peaceful negotiations is not yet blocked." Before the German-Italian talks, Poland, at the request of the Italian government, sent a formal note to Rome, explaining Poland's attitude towards the Danzig incident and reiterating its resistance to Germany's unilateral actions. At the same time, the London Times made a noteworthy comment, saying, "The most valuable contribution of statesmen is to study peaceful solutions that can be accepted by all countries. The two Axis powers will also be happy to seek a solution in the meeting." Diplomatic circles generally regard this article as an invitation to Germany and Italy to participate in an international conference. The Daily Mail published a report from Rome yesterday, saying that Mussolini has discarded the "European Peace Plan." The recent talks between Germany and Italy took this as the main reference. It is widely believed that Mussolini's plan will propose an international agreement to revise the treaties of the past. Part of the treaty may be decided by a referendum. This plan also includes economic and colonial issues. Germany discussed the issue of democratic countries implementing an encirclement policy against Germany. This discussion has drafted a plan that stipulates joint action in the event that this peace plan fails. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax rushed back to the capital from the countryside yesterday, because the report of League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig Burckhardt's talks with Hitler in Germany is expected to be telegraphed to London within days.

<p>(Washington) American newspapers are widely reporting that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had a appeasement policy plan during their talks last weekend. Today, someone inquired about this with the State Department. Acting Secretary of State Welles solemnly stated that Britain and France have not contacted the United States directly or indirectly regarding this matter. Well-informed sources here believe that the rumors in the reports of the Salzburg talks, which have determined that Danzig is not worth a war, are credible, and that Mussolini is rumored to be willing to convene a conference of Britain, France, Poland, and the Axis powers, but according to the formula of the Four-Power Conference of the past, the only difference this time is that the victimized country Poland is also invited to participate. People here believe that the Allies now have the support of the Soviet Union and may firmly reject all such unilateral contacts. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

The headlines of which are all similar, asking, generally, what exactly Burckhardt is doing in Berchtesgaden. A certain newspaper reports that Burckhardt notified England, France and Sweden before going to Germany, but neglected Poland, making it difficult to explain. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Warsaw In regard to the negotiations between League of Nations High Commissioner Burckhardt of Danzig City and German Leader Hitler, political figures in Poland commented on it by comparing it to the British government dispatching Lord Runciman to Czechoslovakia last year to mediate the Sudetenland issue, saying that Leader Hitler may hand over a compromise plan to Burckhardt, called the "final proposal" of Germany, requesting it be forwarded to the Polish government. In reality, "Poland has its own way of weighing its options, and will never blindly follow the Runciman-style mediation." Responsible figures do not wish to express their positions before receiving the report from Chodacki, Polish High Commissioner, who is to meet with Burckhardt after he returns to Danzig City and submit his report tomorrow. However, it is believed that Burckhardt's trip to Germany is part of Germany's strategy of intimidation towards Poland and its allies. In accordance with Leader Hitler's intentions, if the compromise plan he proposes is rejected by Poland, he can then claim that Germany has repeatedly made suggestions for the Danzig issue, all of which have been rejected by Poland, and then threaten military action in order to break Poland's determination to resist and make England announce its surrender.

<p>(Paris) According to the Times of Paris, a powerful newspaper here, one must have considerable reservations about claims that certain totalitarian countries have "peaceful defenses" and that the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy have carefully drafted a peace plan. If Germany and Italy realize that they must change their methods in order to avoid being drawn into a lengthy war that will inevitably lead to their defeat, then the possibility of such a plan is not an exception. The proposal for a Four-Power Pact was first initiated by Rome, and now Italy is proposing to convene a Five-Power Conference. If it were not for the experience of Munich and the subsequent turmoil in Central Europe, the idea of convening such a conference would have had a considerable effect. The situation is no longer the same as last year. The peace plans drafted in advance by Berlin and Rome must be treated with the utmost reservation. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) The one-penny increase in the price of gold this morning has attracted the attention of all circles in London. European buyers were quite active. It was not until the price rose by one penny that the buying spree subsided slightly. Well-informed sources believe that the European eagerness to buy was entirely due to the collapse of the Dutch Mendelssohn Bank, so it seems to be only temporary. Others believe that there are various reasons for this purchase. The possibility of an improvement in the international situation due to the German talks is one of them. Regarding this point, it is said that gold hoarders buy as soon as they see the international situation improve and sell as soon as the situation is poor, as they are deeply afraid that gold may be confiscated by the authorities or become unsalable once a war breaks out.

<p>(London) The British government, fearing German actions in Central Europe and the Balkans, is actively mediating between Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, hoping Hungary and Bulgaria can improve their relations with Romania, thus preventing Germany from exploiting the situation. Sources claim this effort is showing progress. Regarding Hungarian-Romanian relations, it is believed that Hungary's territorial claims can be resolved over time. Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki reportedly told British Minister Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen that Hungary does not intend to abandon its neutrality and become a German vassal. Many Hungarians also believe that rapprochement between Hungary and Romania is possible, provided Romania does not demand Hungary formally relinquish its territorial claims. Britain hopes Hungary will refrain from making territorial demands for the next few months or years, allowing it to resolve outstanding issues with Romania. Furthermore, relations between Bulgaria and Romania also show signs of easing, or at least moving towards "stability." In short, Germany is exerting strong pressure on Central Europe and the Balkans, which is difficult to fully counteract, but the British government has been encouraged and will try to uphold its position.

<p>(Singapore) It was announced here today that overseas Chinese in British Malaya (some of whom are already British subjects) have donated over 2 million pounds to the Chinese government to finance the war effort, provide relief, and purchase "national salvation bonds."

<p>(Tianjin) It was learned today that American citizen Mrs. Richard Tinkler was slapped yesterday afternoon when she attempted to enter the French Concession from the Japanese-controlled area of Tianjin. It is reported that the American Consulate is reporting the incident in detail to the government in Washington. Mrs. Tinkler, who has lived in China for many years and is 59 years old, was carrying a large bag of vegetables, including a pumpkin, at the time of the incident. She carried both an American identity card issued by the American Consulate and a pass issued by Japanese Vice Consul Nishida, as Nishida and Mrs. Tinkler were acquainted. When she reached the Asahi Street blockade, she showed her American identity card to the Japanese soldier, who seemed dissatisfied with the large amount of vegetables she was carrying. She then presented the Japanese pass issued by Nishida. The Japanese soldier ordered her to take the vegetables into the inspection room, which she did, and was guided by a Chinese in uniform. After entering the room, the Japanese soldier ordered her to place the vegetables somewhere. At that time, a Chinese person was being examined in front of her, so she turned around and placed the vegetables in another place. The Japanese soldier seemed very displeased with this and demanded to see her documents. She presented both documents. The Japanese soldier first crumpled the pass issued by the Vice Consul into a ball, and then smoothed it out and held it between his fingers. At this point, Mrs. Tinkler reached out to retrieve the pass. The Japanese soldier became angry and slapped her. Mrs. Tinkler hurried out, sat on a stool, and looked at her watch, wanting to record the exact time of the insult. A few minutes later, she saw a Russian acquaintance passing by and asked for help. The Russian replied that he could not offer much assistance, but he did speak to the Japanese inside the inspection room. After a while, the Russian told Mrs. Tinkler that the Japanese inspector still wanted to inspect the pass issued by the Japanese Vice Consul. Mrs. Tinkler refused to hand it over, but the Russian said that the Japanese promised to return the pass. Mrs. Tinkler then took out the pass, but the Japanese official did not return it. Another Japanese official then entered the room and inquired about the matter, and then allowed Mrs. Tinkler to cross the border. After entering the French Concession, Mrs. Tinkler telephoned the American Consulate. Mrs. Tinkler told people that she often felt that the American identity card issued by the American Consulate was of little use when entering and leaving the concessions, so she had to carry the official Japanese pass. After being insulted, Mrs. Tinkler was very nervous. The local American community expressed sympathy for her. It is reported that the Japanese Vice Consul has apologized to Mrs. Tinkler and the American Consul. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yesterday, a 59-year-old American woman with snow-white hair was slapped by a Japanese soldier, causing outrage among the American community here. According to the American Consulate, the incident occurred at 2:30 pm yesterday on Asahi Road. The old woman was first pushed hard by a Japanese sentry, then slapped on the cheek, and then forced to watch a Chinese man take off his pants. Finally, the vegetable basket and pass in her arm were confiscated. The matter has been reported to the US State Department. The American community here hopes that the State Department will take strong steps to ensure that the sentry is severely punished. The woman is identified as Mrs. Li Yu, a hardworking woman who makes plum sauce for a living. Yesterday, Mrs. Li left the French Concession to buy vegetables. When she returned and reached the obstruction on Asahi Road, she showed her American passport to the Japanese sentry. One of the six sentries refused to let her pass. The woman then showed the pass issued by the Japanese side, which only further angered the Japanese sentry. He ordered her to enter the search shed and take out the vegetables one by one, which the woman did as she was told. At that time, a Chinese man was taking off his pants, so the old woman turned away to avoid looking, but the sentry forced her to look and slapped her on the cheek before letting her go. After Mrs. Li Tinkler passed through the obstruction, she immediately telephoned the American Consulate and asked them to send someone to investigate. At the same time, she also telephoned her Japanese friend Nishida at the Japanese Consulate and asked him to go to the Asahi Road crossing. After both parties arrived, the woman immediately pointed out the sentry who committed the assault, so there is no doubt as to who the sentry was. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The Foreign Trade Commission announced here yesterday that China maintained its position as one of the world's largest tungsten producers last year. China's tungsten exports last year totaled 13,357,100 kilograms, valued at 50,492,820 yuan in legal tender. Although last year's tungsten exports decreased by 3,160,100 kilograms compared to the previous year (1937), the sales price in 1938 increased by 9,743,490 yuan in legal tender compared to the previous year, breaking the highest record since 1929. The announcement stated that China was able to maintain tungsten exports because the tungsten-producing areas are located in southern Jiangxi, northern Guangdong, and southern Hunan provinces, which are far from the Japanese defense lines. The announcement stated that Germany purchased the most tungsten in 1937 due to its rearmament, totaling 4,815,300 kilograms, ranking first among all countries. The United States ranked second, purchasing 2,380,400 kilograms. The United Kingdom ranked third, purchasing 1,663,380 kilograms. The number of tungsten purchases by various countries last year cannot be determined, as the tungsten exported last year was shipped to various countries via Hong Kong, and the original exporter had no knowledge of the destination. Among the other 10 percent, Germany purchased 72,500 kilograms of tungsten, and the United States and the United Kingdom each purchased 75,000 kilograms. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: The British Consulate in Shantou has been established on the rocky hillside of Kakchio for over 80 years. Facing the sea, it has a stone wharf resembling a dike, extending out to the sea, connected to an iron sleeper pier, about 40 fathoms long. People in Shantou have always used the stone wharf as a hub for crossing the sea, and dozens of sailing boats can be docked on both sides. However, due to the long extension of the dike, the nearby silt has become clogged. Years ago, a man named Chen Youzhong contracted to fill the sea beach and prepare to build warehouses, but due to unclear property rights, disputes arose. As a result, a large open space appeared in front of the British Consulate. When Shantou fell, the population of Kakchio increased sharply. The front of the British Consulate became a thoroughfare for people in Kakchio, and the open space was forcibly occupied by</p>
<p>Ronin, who built several sheds to hide filth, making noise until dawn. The beautiful scenery around the British Consulate suffered unspeakable misery. On August 3, the British Consulate advised the Ronin to move, but the Ronin not only refused to comply, but also raised their fists, cursing loudly and shouting anti-British slogans. The British Consul also planned to cross Shantou by speedboat, but at the pier, he was searched by armed Ronin, preventing him from landing and violently attacking him. The British Consul fell to the ground with a bloody nose. The British warship HMS Danae, stationed in Shantou, sent sailors ashore to protect the British Consul back to the Consulate. Since then, British sailors have been protecting the Consulate, and the British Consul does not dare to go out unless necessary. From the 4th to the 7th, more and more Ronin and traitors gathered in Kakchio,</p>
<p>shouting anti-British slogans all day long. Japanese troops were stationed at the Kakchio Customs House, the hillside, and the foreign residences of the Second Maritime Customs, with 20 to 30 soldiers each. When the Ronin on the beach were yelling wildly, the residents of Kakchio village closed their doors and dared not go out, and no one dared to take a boat to Shantou. The traitorous masses, under the armed command of the Ronin, each held a wooden stick and patrolled around, claiming that all employees of foreign companies must resign voluntarily and sever relations with the British. The British Club near the British Consulate was the first to be surrounded. The servants in the house closed the doors tightly and hid like mice. Stones smashed the window glass, or flew into the house from the roof tiles. Other foreign houses and residences suffered the same fate. For several days, the British side had no reaction. The Ronin knew that the British side could tolerate it, and on the evening of the 7th, they further</p>
<p>surrounded the British Consulate. The Consulate covers an area of ​​500 acres, with a low wall around it from the sea side to the top of the hill, with lush trees and streams inside. The Ronin shouted and cursed at the ancestors of the English, scolding the British for being cunning. The British troops in the British Consulate, seeing the forest of wooden sticks and the flying earth and stones, knew that the situation was dangerous, retreated into the garden, held their guns and pretended to ambush. Several times they wanted to rush into the Consulate, but were strongly stopped by the British soldiers. Suddenly, the atmosphere outside the wall became tense, as the traitors were fighting among themselves, and the order was in chaos. Japanese soldiers began to line up on the beach to suppress them. Those guys jumped, shouted, and fled. Afterwards, it was heard that several traitors were seriously injured. The Japanese side claimed that the British sailors had committed the crime that night. It was verified that the British soldiers were stationed in the Consulate and did not step out of the wall. The injured traitors were outside the wall. On the morning of the 8th, Moriya, the Japanese police captain stationed at the Shantou Customs, visited British Consul Brian in Kakchio, expressing a very tough attitude and demanding that the British sailors be severely punished. At 3 pm, the British Consul and Commander Barry of the British destroyer HMS Tenby, stationed in Shantou, visited Japanese Consul Takai in Shantou and went to the Qi Luo Boai Hospital to see if the injured Ronin had been beaten by their companions with wooden sticks. Then they held a meeting with Takai for about two hours, leaving at 5:40. Takai, on the orders of the Japanese army, made</p>
<p>five demands: (1) The British side should confirm that the perpetrators were British sailors. (2) Medical expenses should be paid to the injured Ronin and handed over through the Japanese army. (3) The person responsible for disturbing the peace in the Japanese military garrison area should apologize. (4) The perpetrators should be severely punished. (5) Ensure that such incidents will not happen again in the future. The British Consul received the five demands from the Japanese side and immediately telegraphed Hong Kong to report, promising to reply by the morning of the 10th. This incident occurred in Kakchio and was witnessed by all the foreigners. All were outraged by the five demands made by the Japanese army. Seeing this, the American warship decided to send troops to protect the American church residences and property in Kakchio if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japanese Troops in Dinghai Openly Suppress British Interests, Launch Anti-British Movement, Abuse French Missionaries <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Nearly two months have passed since the fall of Dinghai County. Within the city, over two hundred Japanese soldiers from the Kurashima and Mizu troops are stationed, dispersed in the Public Club near Zhen'aoshan and the residences of Zhu Zhan'san in the East Gate and Pan Rongfu in the South Gate. The area is surrounded by barbed wire, electrified at night. Civilian laborers are forcibly recruited along the head harbor to pile up sandbags and dig trenches, equipped with machine guns. A lookout post is built atop Dongyue Palace Hill along the coast, along with over a dozen large and small bunkers, manned by soldiers day and night.</p>
<p>Since entering the city, the Japanese troops, citing the protective relationship between the Zhoushan Islands and Britain, have launched anti-British propaganda. British female missionaries Burkeley and Sisi from the Catholic Church on West Street in Dinghai were returning to the church in rickshaws from the North Gate when, carrying a sick Chinese baby, they passed a Japanese hospital at a schoolyard. A Japanese sentry at the hospital entrance suddenly ordered them to stop. The female missionaries presented all their certificates and "permits," but the sentry snatched away all their documents and placed a rifle with a bayonet to the chest of the female missionary, threatening her. Upon hearing this, French missionaries from the Catholic Church went to the scene to mediate and extricate them. Furthermore, last month, a Japanese soldier burst into the French Catholic Church, stating to the French missionary that the Japanese military's entry into the city was to suppress all British interests in the Zhoushan Islands and not to fight the islanders. The "Zhoushan Xinbao," jointly run by the Japanese troops and the puppet autonomous association in the city, also incites residents to oppose Britain and vehemently attack it.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese military established a Japanese language training class in front of the county hall, with Japanese national Hasegawa Heizo as the instructor and Ni Xingde as the translator, enrolling over forty students. The puppet autonomous association in Dinghai also plans to restore ten schools, appointing Fei Shengruo as the puppet principal of the ten schools in front of the county hall and Ye Zhonghua as the puppet principal of the Shuyuan Lane Elementary School. Personnel for other schools are being recruited by the association. However, most of the original teachers and students of the schools have successively moved elsewhere.</p>

<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The Xicheng Highway is frequently damaged by guerrilla teams, especially the bridges. The Japanese troops now regard the highway as a lifeline and order the farmers along the route to fill in the bridges, disregarding the farmers' water discharge needs. The farmers in the vicinity rely heavily on water for irrigation and suffer greatly. The puppet governor, He Peixuan, claims that the bridges will only be rebuilt after the overall situation is stabilized and security is restored. The Japanese puppets' disregard for people's livelihoods is evident.</p>

<p>Nantong Correspondence: The Nantong puppet organization recently, following the orders of the Japanese military, established a puppet "urban self-defense corps" and forcefully drafted over two hundred laborers, who have completed training in two batches. They are now conducting the third phase of training, planning to draft twenty laborers from each of the two central control neighborhoods (Central and Ruling), twenty laborers in total from the Qixiu and Yingchun neighborhoods, and fifteen laborers each from Shanzhi, West Bei Park, Wenfeng, and Four Towns, totaling one hundred and twenty laborers. Currently, many laborers fear hardship and evade being drafted, with some bribing at various levels in hopes of avoiding the draft.</p>

<p>Taixian Correspondence: In the dozens of counties in northern Jiangsu, including Xingtai, Gaobao, Dongtai, and Huai'an, the early rice has already been harvested, yielding a bumper crop. The late rice and other autumn crops are also thriving. The wheat harvest in the Huaibei and Xuhai areas averaged around ninety percent, and the autumn crops are also growing vigorously. This year promises a bumper harvest. For the long-term war of resistance ahead, the military and civilian food supply should be assured. Although the Japanese intend to absorb large quantities of grain in Xuzhou and other places, controlling rice and wheat in an attempt to exploit the material resources of the occupied areas to supply their long-term military food needs, the sources of rice and wheat in the occupied counties are mostly blocked by the county governments, dispatched teams, and excellent guerrilla units. Even if unscrupulous merchants intend to profit, they are suppressed, so the source is cut off, transportation and sales stop, and grain prices in the countryside are generally low, making it easy to solve the people's livelihood problems. Conversely, in the cities, grain prices have soared, and there are still no sellers, putting the Japanese puppets at risk of running out of food. The Japanese military in Xuzhou has implemented control over wheat prices, only allowing one flour company to purchase wheat to grind into flour for military food. Other grain merchants are not allowed to purchase or transport wheat without authorization.</p>

<p>Punan News: Wujiaqiao Town in Punan is only separated from Gexing by a river. The Eighth Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army used to be stationed there. However, since the detachment retreated from Nanqiao and Xiaotang, there have been no traces of guerrilla teams in the town. Recently, the Third Branch of the detachment passed by and camped on the outskirts of the town. The Japanese troops were patrolling from Xiaotang, and the guerrilla teams scattered in all directions and resisted with gunfire. The Japanese troops immediately notified Nanqiao by telephone to send reinforcements, who encircled the area from all directions. Fearing that the guerrilla teams were hiding, they set fire to the houses in the town. The extent of the destruction has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: From the first day, the Japanese side has controlled cigarettes, prohibiting the sale of foreign cigarettes such as the British brand in the occupied areas, only allowing the sale of Chinese products such as the Beauty brand. A "Commodity Inspection Office" has been set up by Japanese special agents to crack down on foreign cigarettes and confiscate offending goods or impose fines. All cigarette shops must register. Suzhou City started inspecting cigarette paper shops from the eleventh, and foreign cigarettes can no longer be sold afterwards. All foreign cigarettes in stock, large paper boxes that have been opened, must be opened and a verification stamp added to each small box. Unopened boxes of cigarettes, the number of boxes must be clearly stated, sealed together with the shop owner, and the shop owner must be notified to report to the puppet government when opening the box, to be opened together and a verification stamp added to each small box before it can be sold. Violators will be confiscated. Each cigarette shop must also report the number of cigarettes inspected each day. The intention is to exclude foreign countries, as most cigarettes are produced in the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Extradition of Four Chinese Nationals in Tianjin, British Assessor's Decision Pending, Case of Great Importance Judges Must Consider Carefully, Chinese Safety at Stake Focus of Great Importance <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reports that Mr. Lykes of the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in this port submitted a request for a writ of habeas corpus to Judge Jones of the British Assessor's Court in China last Saturday and Sunday, regarding the four Chinese terror suspects detained by the British authorities in Tianjin. The British Assessor's Court conducted an inquiry this morning (the 15th), and it appears that a decision will not be made within a few days due to the serious nature of the case. The hearing on Saturday and Sunday began in the morning and continued for a long time in the afternoon. Because the four people detained in Tianjin are Chinese nationals and are not subject to the jurisdiction of the British court, Judge Jones decided to give the case careful consideration and to continue to conduct a lengthy study of the request throughout Sunday and this week. According to what can be confirmed, the four people have not yet been extradited to the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, which may be delayed pending a decision by the British Assessor's Court in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This Request Shocks the World</p>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that it learned yesterday (the 14th) that if the request for a writ of habeas corpus submitted to the British Assessor's Court in China last Saturday and Sunday regarding the case of the four Chinese nationals detained in Tianjin is rejected, it will be appealed, if necessary, until the case is brought before the Privy Council in England. The request, which was submitted to Judge Jones by Messrs. Lykes and Jones of the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in this port on behalf of the Elwell law firm in London following a telegram from London, has aroused worldwide concern and has caused a surge in opposition within England to the British government's decision to hand over the four Chinese nationals to the Japanese authorities for trial by the puppet court of the Peking regime, reaching a peak.</p>
<p>The Decision in This Case Has Far-Reaching Implications</p>
<p>This movement has rapidly gathered anti-government forces in England, led by Professor Bentwich, an international law professor at the University of Jerusalem and former Attorney General of Palestine, and Ms. Flora, a director of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Professor Bentwich and Ms. Flora entrusted the Elwell law firm in London and telegraphed the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in this port. Although it had previously been announced in England that Professor Bentwich and Ms. Flora would take legal action to oppose the government's decision, the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in this port suddenly received a telegram from London on the evening of last Friday, and it was not until Saturday that news of Judge Jones's hearing of the request was first revealed. The decision in this case has far-reaching implications, so people in Shanghai believe that the presiding judge will consult with the highest authorities before announcing the verdict, but due to the urgency of the situation, the judgment will not be delayed too long.</p>
<p>The Process of British Approval for Transfer</p>
<p>The four Chinese nationals were detained by the British authorities in Tianjin after Cheng Xigeng, the puppet "Customs Superintendent," was assassinated in a movie theater in Tianjin on April 3. Although a Chinese national had previously been arrested by the British authorities in Tianjin on suspicion of engaging in terrorist activities, and after the investigation was completed, the person was handed over to the Japanese authorities, the British side had resolutely refused to hand over the four Chinese nationals arrested in connection with the Cheng assassination case until last week, insisting that the evidence presented by the Japanese side was not conclusive, but agreed to detain the four people pending further investigation. As a result of the British refusal to hand over the four people, the Japanese side imposed a military blockade and insulted British people who were forced to pass through Japanese obstacles. The negotiations between Craigie and the Japanese authorities in Tokyo were an effort by the British to resolve the issue. At the end of last week, the British government finally instructed Craigie to agree to hand over the four people, but at the same time stated that the British government was satisfied with the evidence presented by the Japanese side and therefore agreed to the extradition.</p>
<p>People of Justice Speak Out</p>
<p>British newspapers, whether Conservative, Liberal, or Socialist, immediately spoke out, and the reactionary movement has grown to a scope "that has greatly disturbed the Chamberlain government" (as stated in a recent telegram from London). Lykes and Jones submitted a request to Judge Jones on Saturday and Sunday, demanding that a warrant be issued to the Tianjin British Concession Police Department. Lykes and Jones insisted that only a duly recognized Chinese court could interrogate the four people.</p>
<p>Chinese Safety is of Utmost Concern</p>
<p>Yesterday, sources in this port indicated that whatever the outcome of the British Assessor's Court's decision, its announcement will have far-reaching consequences, as it will determine the status of all Chinese prisoners detained by foreign concession authorities in China. At the same time, Chinese residents here have expressed great concern about the outcome of the request. Although the news was published relatively late, it spread quickly, and the general public expressed great satisfaction and hoped that the outcome of the Assessor's Court's decision would be favorable to the four people being detained, fearing that if the verdict was the opposite, Chinese people would not be able to consider themselves safe in any concession area. Yesterday, the general public in this port believed that the Assessor's Court would announce the verdict this morning (the 15th).</p>

<p>Over a hundred trade associations in Shanghai, including the pharmaceutical industry, silk industry, cotton cloth industry, slag ash factory industry, knitting, department store industry, rubber leaf, etc., jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Respected Sirs, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the government, in order to stabilize the wartime economy and avoid capital outflow, promulgated measures to restrict withdrawals and utilize bills of exchange for commercial transactions. However, since the westward movement of the national army, a general</p>
<p>gang of villains</p>
<p>are collecting legal tender and purchasing foreign exchange to weaken the war of resistance economy. Recently, they have been using the difference between near and far-term foreign exchange rates to arbitrage interest, which can reach as much as ten to thirteen percent, causing foreign exchange to become increasingly scarce due to supply and demand. Moreover, because the purchase of foreign exchange requires cash, the discount rate has risen sharply, reaching as much as two hundred and seventy yuan per thousand yuan. Legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are both affected by the soaring prices of raw materials due to the impact of foreign exchange and</p>
<p>high discounts</p>
<p>are subjected to double pressure, making it impossible to maintain their production. The general public is also finding it difficult to bear the minimum level of living due to high prices, which is greatly related to the future of the war of resistance. In order to stabilize finance and stabilize industry and commerce, the first step should be to strictly suppress discounting. Anyone who violates national interests and disrupts social finance should be subject to</p>
<p>severe sanctions</p>
<p>and then expand the use of remittances. For those that do not have a direct relationship with foreign exchange, such as paying rent, remittances should be used as circulating currency, and the difference between near and far-term foreign exchange should be equalized so that speculative merchants have no high profits to seek. In this way, the use of remittances will be broad, and the amount of legal tender in circulation will be sufficient, so inappropriate discounts can be gradually eliminated. We sincerely hope that your association will forward this to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e56">Rumor That HSBC Has Agreed to Maintain, Black Market Foreign Exchange Stabilizes, Difficult to Confirm the Claim of Maintaining a Four-Penny Level, All Industries Have Issued Notices of Price Increases Due to Sharp Contraction of Foreign Exchange <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>After Zeng, a member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, decided to do everything possible to maintain the statutory foreign exchange rate, the foreign exchange rate in all non-occupied areas of the country has remained stable. However, the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has contracted sharply due to speculators, leading to unprecedentedly sharp contractions, and all industries have increased prices, greatly affecting the livelihood of the common people. It is rumored that HSBC Bank and others, in order to maintain trade with China, have agreed to maintain it within a possible range. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange Turns Loose and Stabilizes</p>
<p>The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has contracted sharply due to speculators and the frenzied activity of Japanese banks, with the British exchange rate contracting to three and twenty-five pennies and the U.S. exchange rate contracting to six yuan and three hundred and twelve and a half cents. Since Rogers, a member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, came to Shanghai, it is rumored that the HSBC Bank, in order to maintain trade with China, has agreed to maintain it within a possible range. As a result, the black market foreign exchange has loosened from yesterday. However, HSBC's listed price remains unchanged. As for the market rumors that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee has agreed to maintain the black market foreign exchange rate at the four-penny level, the Xinhua News Agency reporter inquired with China, HSBC, Mercantile, and other banks, but it was impossible to confirm.</p>
<p>Various Industries of Foreign Goods Raise Prices One After Another</p>
<p>Due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange, various industries have also issued notices of price increases: (1) Asia Petroleum and Mobil Gasoline, delivered from the pump, is priced at one yuan and forty cents per gallon; (2) Cold storage stack industries have increased the originally scheduled stack rent by 25%; (3) Writing brush and ink industries have increased the price of writing brushes by 30% and Hui ink by 50%; (4) Bathing industries have increased the price of each bath by one to five cents; (5) Incense industries are 20%; (6) The spectacle lens manufacturing industry, all ordinary and scientific lenses, are in accordance with the price list of the industry's trade association; (7) The restaurants Fuxingyuan and Hongyunlou have increased the originally scheduled prices, and other such as Hongxing partridge vegetables, Huaming bean curd fresh juice, Fulai factory bubbles, Meilingden sauce, Zhuangyuan large bottled wine, Weilon camel rabbit velvet, five-minute stomach pain powder, Laohekou Weiling, etc., have also issued notices of price increases.</p>
<p>Import Merchants Suffer the Effects</p>
<p>Since the Chinese government promulgated the rules for applying for statutory foreign exchange for imported goods, the import of all necessities to non-occupied areas can be applied to the China and Communications Banks for foreign exchange. However, import merchants in Shanghai have suffered a great impact due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange. The import of non-essential and luxury goods will inevitably decrease sharply. For those who had already placed orders and had not settled foreign exchange, they have been canceling orders, and new orders have disappeared. Although there are still those who place orders for necessary goods, the prices have had to be increased due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, such as coal and medicine.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association, because after the war, members have either traveled to other cities or have stopped conducting business, and have not applied for withdrawal in accordance with the regulations, resulting in unknown addresses and long-overdue membership fees. Therefore, after deliberation by the board of directors, it was decided to set registration procedures for members. The public announced to all members that regardless of whether they are conducting business or not, or if they are not conducting business but are still willing to pay fees to be members, they must bring a two-inch photo to the association for registration from yesterday until September 15th. After review, a registration certificate will be issued, otherwise they will be reported as voluntary withdrawals.</p>

<p>The rice market in this port is in a serious situation due to the insistence of hoarders. The large rice hoarders are unwilling to let go, causing the rising trend to be unstoppable. The details of various situations have been seen in the Japanese newspapers of the 13th. The newspapers of this port (14th and 15th) also detailed the situation of the rice market being controlled by large rice hoarders. According to reports, the survey of rice stocks in each period has shown a gradual decrease, fearing that the actual number of stocks is not accurate. There is no reliable information about the authorities' plan to purchase foreign rice. Fearing that domestic rice prices will rise sharply after foreign rice is priced, this newspaper has briefly omitted the details. It is now heard that the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau is handling this case with all its efforts, as the food problem in this city is of great importance to the people's livelihood. The Bureau's Food Committee has, after repeated meetings, drafted a number of suggestions for both short-term and long-term solutions, which were originally scheduled to be submitted to a temporary board meeting of the Public Works Bureau convened at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. However, according to reliable sources obtained last night, this meeting was not held yesterday and will be postponed for two or three days. The authorities are deeply considering and planning to find a better solution in this short period of time to facilitate the decision to implement it, because there is a lot of rice hoarding in Shanghai, not only more than 100,000 bags as rumored. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau believes that there should be no problems now and hopes that the flour merchants will not repeat the mistakes of the past and take the opportunity to raise prices and confuse the public.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Remittance Swapping Legal Tender is Purely an Adjustment Among Colleagues, Remittance Account Holders are Not Included, The Banking Industry Has Replied to the Thermos Industry <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The implementation of the new remittance system has had great effects, and the remittances stored in the vaults of each bank and merchant have been swapped in stages, implementing the adjustment of interbank funds. The Banking Association has replied to the Thermos Manufacturing Industry Association that it does not include the remittance account holders of each bank and merchant. The remittance discount is manipulated by speculators. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Swapping Legal Tender to Adjust Colleagues</p>
<p>In the past, the silver and money industry, in order to adjust the funds of colleagues, consulted with the China, Communications, and three banks and obtained their consent to convert all of the existing remittance balances of each bank and merchant (that is, the deposits originally stored in the reserve association and reserve treasury) into legal tender at a discount of 95%, which will be provided by the three banks to the reserve association and swapped in twelve weeks, from July 4th to September 18th. Each week has 1.8 million yuan, totaling 22.6 million yuan, that is, an additional 12 million yuan of cash chips on the market, and after the adjustments, each bank and merchant can fully cope with the deposit measures limited by the horse telegram.</p>
<p>Does Not Include Remittance Account Holders</p>
<p>In the past, the thermos manufacturing industry asked the Banking Association whether the financial resources of industry and commerce could assist the bank's reserve association by transferring remittance income back and forth between the silver and money industry and whether the financial resources of each bank and merchant could be paid with legal tender at 95% . Having received the letter in response, the first regulation of the joint resolution of the banking and money industry states that the remittance deposits of the silver and money industry stored in the vaults of the reserve associations will be exchanged for legal tender by the reserve association at a discount of 95%. This is purely a kind of adjustment of remittance deposits between colleagues and does not include the remittance deposits received by each bank and merchant themselves.</p>
<p>Speculation Manipulates Remittance Discounts</p>
<p>Remittances are originally instruments that are received the next day, and they are the same currency as the allocated funds. As for not being able to receive cash but only being able to transfer accounts, it is a temporary measure during extraordinary times and will inevitably be canceled or restored to the old system of receiving cash the next day after the war stops. Since the bank preparation association has stopped providing stimulants for remittance withdrawals, speculators have taken advantage of the opportunity to manipulate discounts, creating a huge difference between the current remittance and legal tender. However, general legitimate banks and money houses do not engage in this improper business, and the Ministry of Finance and the banking and money industry are studying how to prevent this remittance discount.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Japanese Report, Fighting Resumes in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area, Chinese Guerrillas Active, Japanese Military Suffers Considerable Casualties <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that a Japanese military spokesman announced last week that fighting had resumed and claimed that resistance from small guerrilla groups around Shanghai had been "suppressed." The spokesman reported yesterday (the 14th) at a reception for journalists that fighting had resumed in the Nanjing-Shanghai area between guerrillas and the Japanese military. It is said that several battles occurred in the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou areas between August 10th and 13th. On the day, a small Japanese unit attacked a guerrilla team thirty kilometers west of Shanghai and six kilometers southeast of Baihe Port. As a result of the battle and the battle that took place southeast of Shanghai last week, the Chinese military's attempt to disrupt the peace of the suburbs of this city on August 13 was completely blocked. In the Nanjing area, the Japanese military attacked a New Fourth Army team on August 4, killing one and wounding three Japanese soldiers. On August 6, they fired on the army again, wounding one Japanese soldier. On the same day, there was also a battle seven kilometers west of Jiaxing, killing three and wounding seven Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Sichuan-Shaanxi and Yunnan-Burma Highways are Officially Open to Traffic; The Xi’an-Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway Officially Opens <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Both the Xi’an-Lanzhou and Sichuan-Shaanxi highways are vital arteries of Northwest transportation. The former leads directly to Lanzhou, while the latter bears the mission of connecting with the Southwest. However, although the Xi’an-Lanzhou highway has long been open, there had been no news of the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway's opening. Now, after vigorous negotiations between the Northwest Transportation Administration and the Sichuan Highway Bureau, and preparation of a traffic plan, it is also officially open. It is now known that the road is divided into three major sections: from Chengdu to Guangyuan on the Sichuan border is the first section, from Guangyuan to Hanzhong is the second section, and from Hanzhong to Baoji is the third section. Travelers heading north from Chengdu can purchase tickets within two or three days after registering.</p>
<p>Yunnan-Burma Highway Passenger Service Begins</p>
<p>Since the Yunnan-Burma Highway Administration began active preparations, all progress has been extremely rapid. Now, passenger service began on July 25th, with one departure every morning. Currently, the terminus is temporarily Baoshan, passing through Anduo, Lufeng, Chuxiong, Yunnanyi, Xiangyun, Xiaguan, Yangbi, Yongping, and other places. The journey takes four days. The first night is spent in Chuxiong, the second night in Xiaguan, and the third night in Yongping. The total distance is 668 kilometers, and the passenger fare is 33.40 national currency. As for the continuation from Baoshan to Lashio in Burma, there is no fixed schedule yet.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Jianye Company Property; Rent Increase Proposed; Landlord Proposes 20% Increase; Tenants Have Not Yet Accepted <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The French-owned China Jianye Real Estate Company, which owns several thousand houses in Renji Lane on Ximen Road, Xingshun Lane on Ganshi East Road, Huayuanfang on Father Jin Road, Bugao Lane on Albert Road, Paris New Village on Luban Road, Wanyi Lane, Jianye Lane on Fulilu Road, Xilin Lane on Jiasi Yi Road, and Baierbu Road, Pushi Road, Dapu Bridge, and other locations, recently issued a notice to tenants in its various properties stating that the company, in light of the continuous decline in the value of the French currency and the future changes in Shanghai's monetary situation, has been forced to increase rents by 30% starting September 1, 1939. The company expresses its belief that tenants will understand the company's adoption of this unavoidable measure pending the readjustment of the French currency in the city. Tenants in various properties believe that Jianye Company's rents are already not low, and have already been increased once after August 13th, so they have requested that the increase be waived. After receiving the company's notice, the tenants of Bugao Lane sent a joint letter stating that the rent increase is, in fact, difficult for tenants to bear. Last year's 20% increase on each house already caused unbearable suffering. They originally intended to discuss the matter with the company, but because of their long-standing amicable relationship, they were unwilling to go against the company's wishes. Therefore, even though they were overwhelmed, they had no choice but to endure it temporarily. Now, reading the company's letter, they feel extremely regretful. They point out that the changes in the value of the French currency are related to international exchange rates and are a temporary phenomenon. Moreover, countries of global justice have expressed their support for maintaining stability. Furthermore, the lease agreements between the tenants and the company stipulate the current currency circulating in Shanghai, which is Chinese legal tender. There has been no change in Shanghai, so the company should not raise rents. The tenants jointly and with the utmost sincerity respectfully request that the company, in the spirit of mutual love, retract the rent increase and maintain the friendship between landlord and tenants. It is reported that after receiving the letter, the company invited representatives of the tenants of the lane to talk and verbally agreed to reduce the increase by 10% (i.e., to increase by 20%), but because the representatives refused to accept this, the meeting ended without result.</p>

<p>The city's yarn industry groups have decided to resume operations at 9:00 a.m. today on the second floor of the Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange, under the three principles of Chinese citizens, Chinese yarn, and cash transactions. All brokers joining the trading must enter and exit with badges, and security is very strict. Yesterday, Chinese yarn prices in the yarn market rose by about 15 yuan, while Japanese yarn prices were expected to rise by 3-4 yuan. It is also reported that, calculated by spindle, Shanghai's Chinese yarn factories can produce about 600 pieces of yarn per day. The city's yarn inventory is 130,000-140,000 pieces. There is more Japanese yarn, but there are no accurate statistics.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Australian Merchant Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Purchase Chinese Specialties for Export to Australia; Overseas Chinese Advocate for National Products and Promote Sales as Much as Possible; Sino-Australian Trade Develops and Exports Increase Sharply <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>China's trade with Australia has recently developed extraordinarily, with export volumes increasing compared to before the war. In order to purchase Chinese specialties such as silk products and various embroideries and carpets as much as possible, Australian merchants have formed a Sino-Australian Commercial Company in Shanghai and appointed resident representatives. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Widely Sell Native Products</p>
<p>British Australia has particularly prosperous cities and towns, and many overseas Chinese reside there. People from Guangdong and Shandong provinces account for the majority, while people from Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces are also not few in number. They have always been happy to use native silk, tea, tung oil, porcelain, cotton and wool textiles. After the war, overseas Chinese in the area considered China's holy war of resistance a rare miracle in world history. In addition to sincerely believing in the Chinese government and enthusiastically donating huge sums of money, they also re-established a new understanding of China and unanimously worked hard to promote Chinese specialties. At the same time, they took active actions to introduce famous specialties to people in that country, so trade with Australia has developed extraordinarily.</p>
<p>Australian Merchants Appoint Representatives to China</p>
<p>Australian famous commercial firms consider Chinese silk fabrics, embroideries, and carpet products to be of excellent quality and much loved by people there. They first cancelled their previous method of independently establishing offices in Shanghai. Recently, they formed the Sino-Australian Commercial Company in Shanghai and sent several people, including Mr. Wu of the Mainland Company, as resident representatives in China. The company's capital is currently not fixed, and the funds remitted by Australian merchants are used as purchasing funds. Shortly after its establishment, the Australian side sent a telegram specifying the purchase of Chinese specialty silk embroidery such as bathrobes, morning gowns, and sleeping gowns, as well as carpet curtains, etc., all of which are handmade by Chinese women. Each item is made in Shanghai before being packed and shipped out. Upon arrival in Australia, the finished goods can be put up for sale at any time. The goods are shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then transshipped to Australia. In recent weeks, China's exports to Australia have increased particularly compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Alert Has Been Lifted North of the Suzhou River; Trolley Service Has Resumed on All Lines; The Japanese Blockaded Area is Obstructed <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The alert in the Public Concession has been relaxed starting yesterday. Pedestrians and vehicles can pass through the Old Rubbish Bridge and the Old Zhabei Bridge. The barbed wire on the New Rubbish Bridge and the Pot Tang Lane Bridge has been removed and passage has resumed. The iron gates on North Henan Road, North Shaanxi Road, Kenenghai Road, North Zhejiang Road, and Tongjie Road have been opened. Therefore, trolley routes 5, 6, and 7 all have the boundary road as their terminus. The barbed wire set up by the Concession authorities on both sides of North Jiangxi Road has been removed. The Japanese-blockaded area on the east side of the road is still obstructed. Only the gap on Haiduo Road can be entered and exited, but passage is generally required with a pass.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Current Vegetable Prices Will Not Rise; The Japanese Control Measures are Purely for Treating the Concession <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side's implementation of vegetable control and sales will be realized today. The original route for vegetables from Pudong to enter the concession by civil ships via Shandong Chang Road will be blockaded. Only civilians with empty hands will be allowed to enter and exit. Vegetable vendors must transport their vegetables through the Qichang Wharf to the Hongkou Triangle Land Vegetable Market, and sell them after paying taxes according to the vegetable prices set by the Japanese side. Therefore, vegetable vendors in the concession will have to purchase from Hongkou in the future. It is generally speculated that in the first few days of implementing this control measure, prices will not rise in order to attract people. Once the operation is smooth, prices will be arbitrarily raised. It is also learned that the Japanese side's vegetable price controls are purely for treating the concession, and this does not apply to the suburbs. Therefore, their intentions are not difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>By Wenqin</p>
<p>A Tour of Small Vegetable Markets and Snack Stalls (Continued and Completed)</p>
<p>Further on, there was a tofu pudding stall. A row of customers was sitting on the benches, among whom the most eye-catching was an old gentleman with a figure-eight mustache, hunched over and sharing a bowl of tofu pudding with the little girl sitting next to him. The bowl was placed in front of her, and they were eating a rice cake as they drank the soup, seemingly enjoying themselves very much. The little girl ate slowly, and the old man held the spoon in his hand, hesitating to lower it. The true affection of a father for his child was fully revealed.</p>
<p>There was also a cold drink shop here, a rather unique corner. The place was decorated quite elegantly, enough to stand out from the crowd. The tables were covered with white tablecloths, and the benches were covered with blue cloth cushions. The cushions and the yellow plates on the tables created contrasting colors, making one feel refreshed. The price list in the glass frame showed items such as hygienic mung bean soup, lily soup, and ice soda, and the prices were very reasonable. At this time, a bare-chested strong man was sleeping on the wide shelf of the soda stand, snoring loudly. Seeing this, one couldn't help but sigh. Such an arrangement was truly incongruous. Fortunately, there were no customers at this time, so let him pursue his muddled dreams. I hurried past.</p>
<p>I must also mention the most prosperous stall. Its signboard—a red piece of paper pasted on the wall—was called "Delicious Residence." The fact that the diners were eating with their heads down and the onlookers were swallowing could prove that the name was well-deserved. Although the stall was small, it was implicitly divided into three classes: the benches near the street—where three rickshaw pullers sat, their blue cloth clothes bearing number characters, looking like athletes at a sports meet, but in large numbers, I remember one was 9067; a row of white-clad diners sat on the benches across the way, and at the innermost end, next to a small square table, sat an old gentleman wearing old-fashioned glasses, enjoying his seat in the elegant high-class section. Some were chewing on beef noodles, some were eating plain noodles, and some were leisurely sipping sorghum eggplant peel. The prices were not expensive: beef noodles were nine cents a bowl, plain noodles were five cents a bowl, eggplant case beef soup was six cents a bowl, and a small cup of Zhuangyuan's mung bean wine was six cents, and Wuqiaopi was eight cents. Wine was also available for five cents a cup. If you are not vain and like to be practical, I would like to recommend you try eating a meal. If you don't mind the trouble, first buy a rice cake at the front and then order a bowl of curry beef soup here, or add some pepper, or sip a cup of mung bean wine. The cost is minimal, and you get a full and satisfying meal, which is truly a great deal. I watched the old gentleman finish his meal, stroke his beard, cough loudly, and walk away. Several coolies also patted their stomachs and walked away spiritedly carrying their rickshaw poles. The owner here seemed happy to be serving customers of all kinds, but, unexpectedly, he had also caught the popular tune: "Don't look at how good the business is here. Now everything is going up in price. It's already good if we can make ends meet." He continued to serve the customers with a smile that was half worried. In any case, it seemed to me that he was temporarily a lucky man among the snack stalls.</p>
<p>Of course, there were other snacks such as lotus root porridge, sweet potato soup, fried noodles, wontons, zongzi, and yuanzi, but based on the aforementioned living conditions, it is not difficult to imagine the others. I lingered here for a long time, seemingly attracting everyone's attention. The sesame cake in my basket had cooled, so I turned into the vegetable market and immersed myself in the noisy world.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Real Estate in Continental Mansions on Luban Road is Mortgaged and Involved in Litigation; Debtor Unable to Repay; Creditor Requests Auction <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Zhongjia, the owner of the Jiang Zhongji Construction Factory, residing at No. 38, Block A, Continental Mansions, Luban Road, French Concession, is quite wealthy. Starting in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], he successively mortgaged the land he owned in Continental Mansions on Luban Road, as well as three four-story reinforced concrete residences and one Western-style residence he built himself, along with the title deeds, to the elderly woman Gan Cheng (61 years old, local), residing at No. 35, Taishan Apartments, Masnan Road, Xijiafei Road, for a total of 25,000 yuan. He also mortgaged 55 houses built on leased land in Continental Mansions to Gan Yifei (34 years old, local), residing at No. 7, Chengdu Lane, Chengdu Road, for 20,000 yuan. Both mortgages were for a term of one year, and when they expired, the principal and interest were not paid, totaling over 50,000 yuan. The last term was on June 29th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939]. Because the creditor was unwilling to continue the extension, they commissioned lawyer Zheng Lintong to send a letter to the debtor urging payment, but Jiang still delayed and ignored it. Therefore, the creditors jointly commissioned lawyer Zheng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting permission to auction the mortgaged real estate to repay the debt. If the proceeds were insufficient, they would still seek compensation from the opposing party. After receiving the lawsuit, the court opened a hearing yesterday morning with Judge Lu Jiarui presiding. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs stated the prior facts. Jiang Zhongjia, the opposing party, commissioned lawyer Zhu Yisheng to represent him, admitting the mortgage and requesting permission for an extension so that both parties could conduct reconciliation outside of court. After verifying the statements in court, the judge approved the request and rescheduled the hearing for the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>Feng Xuetai, a 48-year-old Tianjin native, worked as a pavilion guard at the racecourse. He lived at a certain number on Wenzhou Road, Aiwenyi Road. At around 6:30 p.m. last night, Feng's sister-in-law brought a two-cent stamp to a nearby cigarette and paper shop to buy something. The shop believed the stamp was damaged and refused to use it, and the two sides immediately started an argument. After some mediation, the matter was settled. When she returned home, she told Feng what had happened, and he immediately became furious. He led his sister-in-law back to the cigarette and paper shop to argue, cursing endlessly. A local hooligan named Yang Xueyuan, also known as "Little Old Biao," from Anhui Province, 30 years old, who had some influence in the area, saw Feng's arrogant behavior and gathered more than ten of his followers. With a shout, they rushed forward, grabbed Feng, and began punching and kicking him. Feng was not willing to be outdone and fought back with all his might. As a result, Feng was eventually outnumbered and beaten to the ground, causing internal injuries. He died at the scene. Yang's head was also injured. A guard from the nearby No. 139 post heard the alarm and rushed over, arresting the main culprit, Yang Xueyuan, and taking him to the Xinpu Police Station for investigation. The body was taken to the Mailong Hospital and then to the autopsy room for examination.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been many counterfeit goods on the market. Su Xingsan, the owner of Tongfengxiang Store on Aiduya Road, noticed that "Bao Jiu" brand small light bulbs produced by Bao Jiu Electric Factory were selling very well. Therefore, he colluded with Wu Rumao, Lu Xiankun, Zheng Anlan, and Chen Xiaochun to cooperate and counterfeit the products. The matter was discovered by the Bao Jiu factory authorities, who filed a lawsuit for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce. After two trials, the verdict was announced yesterday. Judge Meng Tingke presided over Criminal Court No. 8 and sentenced the defendants Su Xingsan, Wu Rumao, Lu Xiankun, Zheng Anlan, and Chen Xiaochun to a joint penalty of 150 yuan each for the crime of intending to deceive others by counterfeiting a registered trademark. If they were to serve labor service in lieu of payment, each day would be worth two yuan.</p>

<p>The Yunnan Office of the China Vocational Education Society, recognizing that compatriots in the war zone have no fixed residence and that it is extremely inconvenient to communicate news, has established a Traveler Inquiry Department to handle the registration of communication addresses, so that news can be communicated. This is purely a voluntary service and does not charge any fees, making it a most valuable social service, which can greatly benefit those working in the interior. The details of the method are as follows: (1) This department is established to facilitate travelers passing through Kunming City. (2) This department can keep addresses for customers, so that later visitors can find them. (3) Anyone who wants to keep their address can register in person at this department. (4) Registration dates are every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. (5) Registration address: No. 19 Daxing Street, Kunming. (6) This department does not charge any fees, but postage and other items must be provided by the customer. (7) This department may refuse to keep the address for those it deems unwilling. (8) All registrants must communicate with this department every two months to maintain contact.</p>

<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that the Municipal Council announced yesterday (the 14th) that European refugees will not be allowed to land in Shanghai. It has already notified the consulates of various countries and the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Committee, etc. According to a member of the Municipal Council, the Council did not take this action suddenly in response to the Japanese authorities' decision to restrict refugees from entering the area north of the Suzhou River. However, the news that the Japanese side has imposed restrictions has forced the Municipal Council to prohibit</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>of immigrants from entering the area south of the Suzhou River. The two departments have not received an official report on the Japanese side's decision to ban refugees arriving in Shanghai after August 21 from entering the Hongkou District. All they know is what is reported in the newspapers. It is impossible to determine how many Jewish refugees are on their way to Shanghai because ships have not yet reached Hong Kong, so it is impossible to obtain</p>
<p>Exact Numbers</p>
<p>It is also unknown whether they will be allowed to reside in the Japanese-occupied areas. At the same time, the Jewish Refugee Committee is negotiating with the Japanese authorities so that immigrants can reside in the new center on Pingliang Road. Following the Municipal Council's footsteps, the French Consul-General yesterday ordered that no further Jewish refugees be allowed to reside in the French Concession. This new rule has been implemented since yesterday and has been notified to all</p>
<p>Shipping Companies</p>
<p>in Shanghai. At a press conference yesterday, a Japanese Navy spokesman stated that Jewish refugees in Hongkou who have already registered with the Japanese authorities will be allowed to reside and do business. The Japanese side has not made a decision to stop immigrants from landing in the Japanese military zone. However, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai may consider this issue because the Japanese Consul-General has received notifications from the Municipal Council's decision and the Public Works Bureau's attitude.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to the "Japan Advertiser," Tokyo recently disclosed that there is a daily shortage of Japanese miners. Therefore, the number of women and boys working in Japanese coal and iron mines will triple this autumn. The so-called "Ministry of Welfare" has approved the plan to increase the number of women and boys working in the mines, and it is expected to obtain the approval of the Cabinet Planning Board in the near future. The number of women and boys currently employed in Japanese coal and iron mines is no less than 7,000. This number will immediately increase to more than 20,000. Female miners must be at least 25 years old and be relatives of adult male miners. Boys working in the mines must be between the ages of 14 and 16. Since no other country in the world permits women and boys to work in coal and iron mines, the Tokyo authorities are now expressing uneasiness about this matter, claiming that the use of women and boys as labor in Japanese mines will only be a temporary measure.</p>

<p>Cai Jingen, a local, lives at No. 1, Triangle Land, Xujiahui Road. He has been married to his wife, Wang, for three years. Because of their mismatched feelings, conflicts often arise. Wang ran away last November and worked as a servant in a Westerner's home. Cai learned that Wang's behavior was improper and that she was having an affair with a ticket seller, which caused him to hold a grudge. At 7:00 p.m. on the night of the 5th of last month, he gathered a group and waited with a kitchen knife at the intersection of Da Xi Road and Columbia Road. When Wang passed by, he attacked her with the knife, resulting in her being injured in twenty-one places all over her body, and her right hand was also cut off. Cai was arrested by Chinese Detective Yao Changmin of the Jing'an Temple Police Station and sent to the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Wang Yaotang filed charges of aggravated assault. The trial has concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin announced the verdict in Criminal Court No. 2. Cai Jingen was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for the crime of causing serious injury to another person. The sharp knife was confiscated.</p>

<p>The Guangrui Bank, located on the upper floor of the Lida Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 10, Lane 170, Tianjin Road, was suddenly invaded by three robbers at 11:45 a.m. on the 1st of this month. Two of the robbers brandished handguns and threatened the staff. After searching extensively, they robbed the bank of 5,720 yuan in Zhongzhongjia legal currency and 7,100 yuan in banknotes from various banks in Tianjin, Shandong, Wuhan, and other places, totaling 12,820 yuan. At the same time, four gold rings worn by the bank employees, each weighing two qian, were also robbed. After the bank reported the incident to the General Police Station and requested an investigation, Chinese Detectives Fan and Huang and Inspector Gao Zhen of the Police Station, based on clues, arrested one of the robbers, Ma Qingyuan (38 years old, from Wenzhou), at No. 10, Lane 145, Guling Road, and confiscated 683 yuan in banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and other places. Later, they arrested Cao Hanqing (53 years old, from Jiangbei) and Cao Tan, a woman from Henan (27 years old), at No. 18, No. 12, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in Criminal Court No. 1. The defendants Cao Hanqing and Cao Tan were defended by lawyers Xu Jiaji, Pan Zhensheng, and Zheng Yuankai. Police Station lawyer Jiang Baolian charged Ma with the crime of robbery according to Articles 328 and 330 of the Criminal Code, while Cao and Cao were only suspected of receiving stolen goods, so they were charged with receiving stolen goods according to Article 349 of the Criminal Code. Because Ma has also committed many other theft cases, it was requested that the hearing be postponed to facilitate investigation and further prosecution.

<p>Zhang Dongcai, an 18-year-old youth and student from Chongming, residing at No. 28, Deming Lane, No. 120, Route Ghisi, in the French Concession, was a student at Minli Middle School. During the summer examinations this year, he failed his courses, leading to him having to repeat a grade. After being reprimanded by his parents, he became depressed and harbored thoughts of ending his life. In recent days, he had written suicide notes and sent them to his classmates to say goodbye. However, his resolve to kill himself was not yet firm. On the 10th of this month, at 9 PM, he was cooling off in front of his door when he had a verbal conflict with his 11-year-old younger sister, Zhang Xuemei, over a rocking chair. Zhang was scolded by his mother, Zhang Chen (40 years old), who also patted the back of his head and neck twice. Zhang felt that his mother was favoring his younger sister, causing him to be humiliated. This solidified his determination to commit suicide. He went to his bedroom and secretly swallowed sulfuric acid solution. His mother discovered this and immediately took him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The next day, his classmates, having received Zhang's pessimistic letters, came to visit and comfort him. Zhang had already taken poison and been sent to the hospital. From this, it was known that Zhang had harbored suicidal thoughts for some time due to academic issues. Ultimately, due to the severity of the poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6 AM on the 14th. The hospital reported this to the police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was then sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. Yesterday, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court was requested to come to the parlor to confirm that the death was due to poisoning. The body was claimed by his mother for burial. It is said that the deceased was the only son, and his father is currently doing business in another location.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Legal Wife and Concubine: Property Dispute Leads to Endless Litigation, Supreme Court Remands Case for Retrial Again <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The late Li Shiyang, Director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau and a native of Hunan, married a woman from his hometown named Shou Yu through a matchmaker. They were married for over twenty years and had several children. In 1933, Li wanted to take Wu Wenhua, a young woman from Suzhou, as a concubine. Therefore, Chen Zemin (the current puppet governor of Jiangsu Province), acting as a lawyer, drafted a separation agreement. Li provided Shou Yu and their children with a monthly living allowance of 200 yuan. Shou Yu took her children to live in Huaping. Li and Wu Wenhua</p>
<p>lived together for three years</p>
<p>and then also drew up an agreement to separate. Wu Wenhua had a younger sister, Sun Huifen (28 years old this year, from Suzhou), who was beautiful and skilled in social interactions. Therefore, Li formed an inextricable bond with Sun Huifen and gifted her 30,000 yuan. The year before last, Li and Sun came to Shanghai for medical treatment. Shortly after, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and Shou Yu took her children south to seek refuge. Li then rented a residence for Shou Yu and her children at No. 25, Jingu Village, Route Pere Robert, in the French Concession. In early October of that year, Li became seriously ill and went to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Soon after, he</p>
<p>died from his illness.</p>
<p>During the period when Shou Yu was handling her husband's funeral, Sun Huifen only presented a wreath as a guest. Therefore, Shou Yu did not suspect anything else. In the spring of last year, Sun Cifen commissioned a lawyer to send a letter to Shou Yu demanding 5,000 yuan from a savings account, claiming Li Shiyang as her deceased husband. Shou Yu then realized that Sun Huifen had an improper relationship with her deceased husband and learned that her deceased husband had lost a large sum of money. Therefore, she</p>
<p>refused the demand</p>
<p>from Sun Huifen. Subsequently, Sun Huifen hired lawyers Ma Shouhua and others to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting that Shou Yu be ordered to return the 5,000 yuan from the savings account. In the first instance, Shou Yu lost the case. Shou Yu, dissatisfied, hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, resulting in Sun Huifen losing the case. Sun was also dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court again. As a result, the original judgment was overturned and remanded to the Third Branch of the High Court for a new trial, which again ruled against Shou Yu.</p>
<p>Still unwilling to accept defeat,</p>
<p>Shou Yu again hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to file an appeal to the Supreme Court. It is now known that the presiding judge of the Supreme Court, Weng Jingtang, and judges Guo Xuru and Cao Fengxiao, after reviewing the case, considered the original judgment to be inappropriate and that Shou Yu's appeal was not without merit. Therefore, they recently issued a judgment with the main text stating that the original judgment was vacated and remanded to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. Shou Yu's previous case against Sun Huifen for disrupting the family, filed in the Second Special Court, is still in the process of being suspended.</p>

<p>The first autumn flood tide of the Huangpu River suddenly occurred at 0:00 yesterday morning. However, due to the clear weather, the flood volume did not exceed the predicted 11 feet 7 inches. At that time, the water along the river was very close to the banks. At the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Gansu Road, for example, the tide had flooded the banks due to the particularly low-lying terrain. The water only receded at dawn. The accumulated water emerging from the sewers in low-lying roads had not completely receded even after 9:00 AM. The high tide at 1:00 PM yesterday was slightly less than the early tide. This morning's high tide at 0:00 exceeded 12 feet. The high tide on the 17th will also be higher than the Jiang'an embankment of the Bund, so it deserves serious attention.</p>

<p>A new typhoon has emerged in the Pacific Ocean and landed in Fuzhou the day before yesterday. However, the wind force was not strong, only four on the wind scale. By the time the typhoon reached southwest of Fuzhou, it had weakened to one on the wind scale. Yesterday's initial report of the typhoon indicated that it tended to disperse and dissipate, so it was not worth paying attention to. However, a new typhoon has arisen near Guam in the Pacific Ocean and is currently moving northwest-west. If the trend does not change, Shanghai will also be threatened, but it is still far from Shanghai, so the wind force is unknown.</p>

<p>Li, a Cantonese woman in her fifties, had fallen into prostitution in her younger years, working as a prostitute in the Hongkou area, commonly known as a "salty water sister." Later, she partnered with a Western sailor and lived together for several years. After the sailor returned to his country, they separated. Since then, Li has lived a solitary life. In recent years, she has specialized in collecting beautiful young girls, forcing them to dance, and profiting from it. Therefore, her life is still affluent. One of these girls, Luo Damei, is 21 years old and the biological daughter of a sister companion of Li's youth, adopted by Li and renamed Li Damei. Before the war, she danced at a dance hall in Hongkou, mainly serving Western dancers. After the war, Damei changed to another dance hall, where business was bleak and her income was far less than before, causing Li's dissatisfaction. She often abused Damei. Unable to endure the hardship, Damei ran away from home two months ago. Li repeatedly negotiated, forcing her to return home, but Damei refused. Recently, Li filed a petition with the Conciliation Department of the First Special Court, requesting conciliation to demand that Damei return home. She also claimed that Damei is now surrounded by villains who intend to use her as a cash cow. Li fears that she will suffer, so she applied to have her return home to complete their kinship. Yesterday, Judge Zhou opened the court for conciliation. Damei commissioned a lawyer to attend on her behalf, stating that she was not Li's biological daughter and that she had left because she no longer wanted to be Li's slave. She disagreed with the petitioner's request to return home. The court, seeing that the intentions of both parties were contrary, announced that the conciliation in this case had failed and ordered a formal lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Northwest Apartment at No. 431 Rue Molière in the French Concession was jointly established by Jia Lansheng, Gu Zongchang, Zhang Zhangshi, Jia Lushi, Jin Wenfu, Zhang Hongjiu, Wang Kelin, and others from Anhui Province. Shareholder Jin Wenfu was appointed as the manager. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident three years ago, due to the large population and shortage of housing in the Shanghai concessions, the apartment's business has been very profitable. In the spring of this year, shareholders Jia Lansheng, Gu Zongchang, Zhang Zhangshi, and Jia Lushi discovered that manager Jin Wenfu had engaged in</p>
<p>fraudulent embezzlement.</p>
<p>Therefore, they hired lawyers Zhu Dianqing and others to file a criminal embezzlement charge against Jin Wenfu in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, along with an attached civil suit, seeking to recover the embezzled funds. After accountants investigated the accounts, the income and expenditure were offset, and a shortage of nearly 400 yuan was found. Judge Liao opened court for inquiries multiple times. The defendant hired lawyer Li Ming to defend him. Due to the</p>
<p>complexity of the case,</p>
<p>it lasted four months and could not be concluded. Now, with the mediation of six relatives and friends, including Shen Heqing and Huang Donghai, the shares of the defendants Jin Wenfu, Zhang Hongjiu, and Wang Kelin were transferred to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs compensated them with a withdrawal fee of 2,300 yuan. Jin, Zhang, and Wang terminated their relationship with the Northwest Apartment, and it was operated by Jia Lansheng and others. On the first of this month, a</p>
<p>settlement agreement</p>
<p>was signed. Yesterday afternoon, the court reopened to announce a renewed trial. Both parties and their lawyers stated that they had already settled out of court and requested the withdrawal of the attached civil suit and lenient treatment for the criminal part. After reviewing the situation, the court declared the criminal case closed for debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 21st. The civil part was allowed to be withdrawn.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Chief Editor:</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's article on the 14th regarding housing litigation, I would like to make the following clarifications: Jianhua has rented the city-owned house at No. 578 Avenue Joffre for over ten years and has spent more than 2,000 yuan on tips, renovations, etc. Recently, due to the abnormal development of the market in that area, someone offered Sun Wenquan, the landlord, 7,000 yuan to take over the house, forcing Jianhua to pay another 3,000 yuan in tips. Unsatisfied with this, they sued the court to have us evicted. The judge in the first instance, considering the hardship of the tenants' eviction, rejected Sun's lawsuit. However, the judgment from the sub-court has not yet been received, yet we have already been judged to have lost the case. There is still the Supreme Court, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration to appeal to for remedy. The house in Qingyuli, Chongqing Road, can be used as evidence. Regarding the complaint against Sun Wenquan, first, we have not defaulted on rent and have been subjected to the court's false execution without a court hearing or debate. Second, the rent has been increased twice within half a year. The first increase has already been paid according to regulations, and the second increase requires an additional 140%, that is, the rent of 100 yuan has been increased to 240 yuan. Unsatisfied with this, they have resorted to intimidation, which has already been reported to the police. Third, the house is being taken over, and we are being forced to move out. These three inhuman acts are occurring in broad daylight. Therefore, I must appeal on behalf of all tenants. I hereby request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tao Jianhua, August 15th</p>

<p>The Student Relief Committee, organized by the Shanghai YMCA, recognizes that since the war, prices have soared and people's livelihoods have been difficult. To encourage students from poor families to pursue their studies, it is providing financial assistance so that outstanding students in the city affected by the war can continue their education. Students enrolled in specialized schools or above and registered senior middle schools in the city who meet the following qualifications can apply for assistance from the committee: (1) Those from poor families whose economic situation has been genuinely affected by the war; (2) Those who would be unable to enroll without the committee's assistance; (3) Those who are of good character and academic standing and actively participate in extracurricular activities; (4) Those who have previously received assistance from the committee and have a good service record. The application process ended on the 14th. Over one thousand applicants submitted applications to the committee. The committee is currently conducting a detailed investigation based on the application forms, consulting with the students' schools and other relevant organizations and individuals. This review process is scheduled to be completed before the 22nd of this month. An examination will be held for the applicant students on the 22nd. After the examination, individual oral examinations will be held for outstanding students at the end of this month. Those who are deemed qualified by the committee will be notified, and the subsidy will be paid by the treasurer in one or two installments, as specified in the application. The number of subsidies available is around 150. The subsidy for university students will not exceed 50 yuan per semester per person, and the subsidy for middle school students will not exceed 30 yuan per person. Unless there is a special reason, students who receive assistance from the committee must undertake appropriate voluntary service work.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Education Expert Wan Minhao Discusses Preparations Before Exams (Continued) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Reviewing Coursework</p>
<p>Once the department has been selected, you should begin reviewing coursework. The scope of the review should be based on the exam subjects specified by the recruiting school. For example, the unified enrollment in 1938 divided the written exams into three groups, with different emphasis depending on the department. Candidates must prepare according to which group the department belongs to, as stated in the prospectus. For the subjects that can be chosen from, you should also identify the one you are best at as early as possible and review it. Some say that middle school graduates have not been away from school for long, and all courses are not neglected, so why bother reviewing? Others say that the exam period is imminent, and rather than cramming at the last minute, it is better to let nature take its course. Both of these views are wrong. The entire middle school curriculum is not just what was learned in the last semester. What was learned earlier is inevitably forgotten, so it must be reviewed to become systematic knowledge. As for cramming at the last minute, it is indeed a bit late, but it is still better than sitting idly by and missing the opportunity. Success often depends on the effort in the last five minutes. Opening a book is beneficial, and every inch of time is worth gold. You must never allow yourself to be lazy and regret it later. One more thing I must tell the students going on to higher education is that when reviewing the curriculum, you must never use popular books such as "Questions for Each Subject" or "Essential for Exams" from the market. The scope and level of the entrance exams for specialized schools and above are limited to the high school curriculum standards. The content of the questions is based on the general textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, the textbooks you usually read at school are also the only reliable books when reviewing. You don't need to look for anything else and divide your energy. Those "Questions and Answers for Each Subject" and "Essential for Exams" either overemphasize memory and are too cumbersome, or they are incomplete and simplistic. Some even have numerous errors. If you want to use them as testing materials to see how well you have reviewed, you should carefully select the ones that are relatively presentable. If you regard them as a secret treasure for the exam, you will mislead yourself lightly.</p>
<p>Completing Procedures</p>
<p>During the period of reviewing coursework, you should also pay attention to completing the various procedures that must be completed before the exam. The most important of these is registration. The items required for registration, such as recent photos, the registration form for the school you plan to take the exam at, the middle school diploma or certificate of transfer, the service certificate or deferral certificate for teacher training students, and the certificate of poverty issued by the government of the original county for applying for free or reduced fees, cannot all be prepared in one or two days. You should prepare them in advance to avoid missing the registration deadline. When registering, you should pay attention to the following: 1. The registration form must be filled out clearly and truthfully according to the instructions attached. Be sure to check the number of items specified in the prospectus one by one. For example, if the prospectus specifies two registration forms and four photos, you must not arbitrarily reduce them. This should be especially noted for correspondence registration. You must also use express mail or airmail to avoid delays. In addition, you should pay attention to the examination location and time, as well as the stationery and admission ticket that must be brought to the exam before taking the exam. (End)</p>

<p>The second finals of the five events in the Shanghai Open Swimming Championships were held at the West China YMCA pool last night. Wen Jingling made a stunning debut, defeating Oliveira in the 50-yard freestyle to win his first title, setting a glorious record previously unattained by Chinese swimmers. Due to starting in the second heat, Wen's mentality was somewhat affected, causing him to enter the water last. He was still behind Oliveira at the halfway turn, but ultimately relied on a final sprint to win the championship by half an arm's length. Lu Shungen also defeated last year's champion, Lungen, to win third place, although his time was not as good as in the preliminary round. The men's 50-yard freestyle was established in 1920, and all previous champions had been Westerners. Now, Wen Jingling has won a title, breaking the unprecedented record of the Shanghai Championships. Frog King Guo Zhenheng was absent from the 150-yard medley. In women's diving, only one person participated, and someone was temporarily invited to jump along, so Miss Grey was sure to win the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuates, Gold Prices Still Fail to Decline; Outdoor Market Rises to $4,400 in the Evening; Daily Turnover Around 1,200-1,300 Taels <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market conditions were still extremely erratic at first, then seemed to stabilize slightly later, but generally operators still expected an upward trend. Therefore, although foreign exchange slightly increased, gold prices reversed and rose. It was rumored that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) was buying on the cheap, so it is expected that it will be difficult for foreign exchange to continue to rise. Moreover, the tense situation in Europe that was rumored the day before now seems to have eased slightly. Given that the current gold price is still heavily discounted by more than $600 compared to the foreign exchange settlement price, generally foreign banks, Hong Kong banks, and wealthy people in the city continued to increase their purchases. However, the morning opening was affected by the weak tone from the afternoon of the previous day, and it was rumored that the US dollar had broken through the 7 yuan mark, leading to cautious observation by buyers for a time. The opening thus fell sharply by $105, retreating to $4,380 at the peak. After 11:30 AM, foreign exchange trended tighter again, so the gold price also softened accordingly. The afternoon opening had fallen again to $4,305. Afterwards, foreign exchange returned slightly softer, and the buying side was strong, so the price recovered to $4,348 in the evening, resulting in a gain of $3 compared to the previous day. It was rumored that the outdoor gold price had risen sharply to $4,400 at 6:00 PM, with some saying that someone wanted to buy. The total daily transaction was still strong, around 1,200-1,300 taels. Silver jewelry prices first fell and then recovered, ending with no gains or losses. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold both trended upward.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Only Rose by $3</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening price per bar (10 taels) fell sharply by $105 due to tighter foreign exchange, rumors that the US dollar had weakened to outside the 7 yuan mark, and generally fatigued sentiment. A money exchange sold 20 taels to a gold firm for $4,240. After the opening, due to a certain bank's strong appetite, the market moved upward and soon recovered $60. Money exchanges mutually traded 30 taels for $4,300. Later, silver banks and money exchanges sold each other, once again pushing the price down to $4,260. Around 10:00 AM, the rumor of foreign exchange softening triggered buying, and a certain silver bank absorbed more on behalf of Hong Kong banks. In addition, retail absorption was strong, so the market soared, rising $120. A gold firm bought 20 taels from money exchanges for $4,380. After 11:30 AM, sellers suddenly became active as foreign exchange rebounded tighter. Securities firms and silver banks competed to sell, and soon fell $60. Silver banks mutually traded 30 taels for $4,320. Later, money exchanges mutually traded 50 taels for $4,340 as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the opening price immediately fell $35 due to foreign exchange noon closing tightening and fatigued sentiment. A money exchange sold 30 taels to a silver bank for $4,305. Subsequently, due to a certain bank's renewed absorption and foreign exchange slightly softening, the price rose $30. A certain silver bank bought 60 taels from a gold firm for $4,335. Later, money exchanges sold again, once again pushing the price down to $4,320. Afterwards, a certain gold firm purchased on behalf of speculators, and the price recovered $30. A certain gold firm bought 30 taels from a securities firm for $4,350. Later, a silver bank sold 20 taels to a money exchange for $4,348 as the evening closing price. In the end, it only rose $3 compared to the previous day, fluctuating $140 throughout the day. The cash firm's own-brand gold was $10 higher than the actual price, and the current standard gold price was $65 lower than the listed gold price, with very little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold First Fell and Then Recovered</p>
<p>Silver jewelry gold, each tael exchanged, was initially priced at $440 by Datong firm. Then at 9:30 AM, it suddenly dropped $10, and after more than 45 minutes, it recovered $10. There were no changes after that. In the end, Datong firm still held at the original price of $440. The new Datong firm bought in for $438, and needed to reduce about $20.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Suddenly Increased by One Penny</p>
<p>London, 14th - British pure gold suddenly increased by one penny, rising to £7, 8 shillings, 7.5 pence. As a result, the central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also rose to $1,213.3.

<h3 id="e104">Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizes <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market conditions yesterday: the HSBC listing announcement showed no change. The British and American exchange market conditions were gradually stabilizing. HSBC absorbed on the cheap and sold at high prices. Sentiment has stabilized, causing the process to hover above the previous evening's closing price. Although foreign firms were settling, HSBC's supply was very good. Later, due to sales from Hong Kong and Tianjin bulls selling, the market loosened to British gold 3 3/8 pence and US dollar 7.0625. Around 10:00 AM, the Japanese banking community suddenly absorbed, so the situation recovered to British gold 3 5/16 pence and US dollar 6.875 (same as the morning opening). After that, it gradually stabilized. Until after 11:30 AM, Hong Kong continued to sell, and Bombay Silver Company also sold. Tianjin also continued to show selling intentions, so the potential trend loosened again. HSBC still had an appetite for British gold at 3 3/8 pence, so the loosening was hindered. Afterwards, because a certain bank also intended to buy, the price recovered slightly. In the end, it closed at British gold 3 9/32 pence and US dollar 6.9375. This month's futures market, due to the approaching settlement date, the spread was also slightly narrowed. Finally, British exchange loosened by 0.046875 and the US dollar increased by 0.09375. For the August-September swap, it was rumored that a certain bank offered Chinese merchants half a yuan for US dollars, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 7.5%, but the amount was small. The total daily transaction was still strong.</p>
<p>Tianjin Bulls Also Returned to Sell</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, London strips, recent increased by 0.0625, distant increased by 0.125, New York silver prices increased by 0.375, London raw gold increased by 1 penny, exchange rate British vs. US/France was flat, vs. Shanghai increased by 0.125, US vs. British was still flat, Liu-Shanghai increased by 0.45, vs. France increased by 0.0625. The central listing of various exchanges remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were British gold 3 17/64 pence and US dollar 6.875, with no change compared to the previous closing. After the opening, the first foreign firm settled, purchasing HSBC spot British gold 3 1/2 pence. Then they purchased standard Chartered spot US dollar 6.875. Then a Hong Kong telegram came selling, and a certain broker also sold on behalf of Tianjin, so the potential trend loosened immediately. The Hong Kong telegram and Tianjin successively sold HSBC and other foreign banks spot British gold from 3 9/16 pence, rising to 3 5/8 pence, and sold a certain bank standard Chartered spot US dollar from 6.9375 to 7.0625. When the HSBC listing announcement was made, there were no changes, and the white silver street tax announcement was still exempt. After that, the selling wind had ceased. In addition, the Japanese banking community came to settle, so the potential trend tightened. The Japanese bank purchased foreign banks spot British gold at 3 9/16 pence, and spot US dollar at 6.9375. Later, it was difficult to settle at British gold 3 17/64 pence and US dollar 6.875. Until around 11:00 AM, the Japanese bank had stopped purchasing and observed, and foreign banks were more willing to sell, so the situation gradually stabilized. Hua Yi absorbed the same bank this month's US dollar at 6.8125, and then there was profitable settlement of a certain bank September US dollar at 6.3125. It was rumored that there was some August-September swap trading, with a certain bank offering Chinese merchants half a yuan for US dollars, approximately equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 7.5%. After 11:30 AM, Bombay Silver Company suddenly dumped and sold. At the same time, Hong Kong telegraphed to sell, and it was rumored that Tianjin also intended to sell, so the market became looser again. Bombay Silver Company and Hong Kong telegrammed to sell HSBC spot British gold at 3 5/8 pence, and sold a certain bank spot US dollar at 7.0625. In the afternoon, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold 3 5/8 pence and US dollar 7.0625.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Was Quite Quiet</p>
<p>Following the market conditions, only a certain American bank had a slight appetite, so the trend appeared slightly softer. The certain bank absorbed Dutch spot US dollar at 7 yuan. Then foreign banks mutually traded spot British gold at 3 5/8 pence. Little trading was heard afterwards. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold 3 9/32 pence and US dollar 6.9375, this month's British gold 3 1/2 pence and US dollar 6.8125, September British gold 3 3/16 pence and US dollar 6.1875. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British exchange loosened 0.09375, and the US dollar increased by 0.0625. This month's British exchange increased by 0.046875, and the US dollar depreciated by 0.09375. The newly opened September price closed, at British gold 3 3/16 pence and US dollar 6.1875.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Foreign Currencies Recovered, US Tickets Rose by 65 Cents <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency, foreign exchange slightly loosened, but the actual price suddenly increased in the afternoon, and became exceptionally popular after closing. British and American gold pounds turned from weak to strong. The demand for British and American gold pounds increased, and the market rose. Customers absorbed British and American gold tickets very eagerly. The supply of US gold tickets was scarce, and the market was most popular. Hong Kong tickets loosened with the exchange rate, slightly decreasing. The demand for Annam tickets was scarce, and the market returned to normal. Japanese gold tickets were still strong, at $1.13 in the evening market. Korean tickets were stagnant in supply and demand, at $0.94. Other currencies were stable, with no gains or losses. The guild did not trade. Yesterday's market prices were British gold pound up 50 cents, US gold ticket up 65 cents, Hong Kong ticket down 2 cents, Annam ticket down 20 cents, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Another Batch of Cash Added <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Silver and money industries, in order to regulate the funds of the industry, negotiated with the three banks to agree to use a total of 22 million yuan of silver and money treasury remittance deposits at the end of June, discounted at 95% into legal tender, and withdraw it in 13 installments, once every Tuesday from July 4th. This has been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday was the period for the seventh payment, estimated to be 1.8 million yuan of legal tender. Some industries have withdrawn cash from the association, and others have transferred it to national currency accounts for appropriation. Due to the increase in cash chips, remittance discount rates fell by $7.5. (M)</p>
<h3 id="e107">Food: Store Appetite Slightly Stagnant, Rice Prices Slightly Loosened; Rumors of Ordered Foreign Rice, Hoarders Still Struggling <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Du Geng’s source, the lower reaches of the river, has arrived in No. 4 wheel-packed steamers, numbering 1,300 to 1,400 packages, while Wuhu’s top-quality rice is rumored to have arrived with 4,000 to 5,000 packages, so people's hearts suddenly turned weak. After the three days of excitement, the stores on this street had also prepared enough, so the appetite in the stores was also relaxed. The market then found it difficult to gain a foothold, and prices successively fell by about $1.50. High Tin Geng opened at $27.50, the mid-market opened at $27, and Su Kun, Changzhou, and other Geng opened at $27 to $26.50. Nangang early and late rice packages opened at $26. The lower reaches only opened at $25.20 to $25. High tip opened at $24.50, the market Wuhu tip opened at $24, the mid-market at $23.50 to $23, Bian Yuan at $26, and Hong Kong glutinous rice at $27. The total market turnover was no more than 3,400 to 3,500 packages, and the trend was expected to continue to decline due to the weak confidence.</p>
<p>The large market loosened slightly, and the impact was not easy to reach the retail stores. So yesterday's retail sales were still not loose. According to rumors, yesterday's purchase of rice costing $25 was mixed with debris, and rice costing $27 was still acceptable for cooking, but there were still quite a few people who could not buy rice. This newspaper has previously said that the financial community should bear the responsibility for indirectly raising rice prices, and many people doubted its impropriety. Recently, many evening newspapers' rice market records have also said this, which shows that this newspaper's news is based on some evidence. There are several theories about rice prices. Some believe that it is better to openly release the limited price rather than messing with the black market. Some say that the limited price should be released to $25 or $26. If this is implemented, the hoarders will return fully loaded, and the financial community will receive the principal and interest of the mortgage. However, since the dawn price is as high as $28 or $29, it is still "pulling the snake backwards," and it may be difficult to eliminate the black market. As for ordering foreign rice and carrying out leveling, no one welcomes it. However, it is worth considering that if Saigon rice is converted into Shanghai market pecks at a rate of 6 Vietnamese dollars per peck, a legal currency exchange rate of 4.3 yuan is already needed for $12.58. Adding taxes and water fees, it is already close to the high Geng black market price. If you want to level prices, it must not be higher than the current limited price, that is, selling at the limited price, each stone subsidy must be a number of $6 or $7, and the rise in cooperation is not included. Moreover, the price of foreign rice must be $37 per package (see another article"). Where does this large amount of investment come from? A large amount of foreign exchange is wasted in vain, and the actual situation of the current rice and grain situation is such that we have reached a point where foreign rice is indispensable, all of which must be seriously considered. However, negotiating foreign rice can remove the courage of treacherous merchants and hoarders and make them release their goods, which is not a bad idea.</p>
<p>The hoarders are watching the fire from the other side of the river, talking cool words, thinking that everything is expensive, but rice is the only cheap one. If calculated at the current British gold price of 3.5 shillings to a yuan, the current rice price, even if it is sold for $30, is only equivalent to the previous $7.2 (each yuan is equivalent to 1 shilling and 2.5 pence), so it is not satisfied. This is truly the so-called desire to use local goods as foreign goods for pricing.</p>
<p>Guest Xian: Yesterday, a small number of high-quality rice from Nanjing had been shipped in, and it was rumored that the first batch of more than 4,000 packages from Wuhu had also been loaded. The subsequent 100,000 package transport certificate will also be negotiated successfully, so the people's hearts are stable and the appetite of the importers is relaxing. The cargo side is difficult to recover. A part of the guest market will be depreciated late, and the market is declining by $0.60-0.70 to over $1. The high guest still opened at $24.80, and the middle level will be lowered more severely.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: It is rumored that a certain party has ordered 10,000 tons from foreign companies, at a price of 37 yuan in Shanghai, and will be shipped to Shanghai to help the citizens and will be sold at parity prices. If this is true, it is good news for the future of food. As for the market's new Saigon retail price, it still shouts $32. The importers lack the intention of inquiries because the guest rice has decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Flour Hoarding Persists; Returned Goods Are Actually More Expensive Than Factory Prices by $0.10-$0.20 <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Retail sales on the street are active, and there are many people in the market who buy warehouse receipts, so the returned goods are actually more expensive than the factory prices. It is difficult to verify the rumored price of $6.30-$6.40. Yesterday, it was heard that the returned goods were $0.10 to $0.20 more expensive than the factory prices. The factory prices are still $6 in cash, only for this street. Guest prices are still not open. Today, 17,000 packages of flour will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trend was strong. During the suspension of the Miscellaneous Grain Association for several days, wheat has arrived and sold. Because the flour price has reached $6, the raw materials will naturally increase accordingly. Yesterday, it was heard that Fuxin and Fufeng factories both had acquisitions. The streets and warehouses also absorbed wheat. The two factories of Fuxin and Fufeng acquired more than 10,000 packages of wheat from Changzhou, Xixi, Danyang, Liuhe, Puzhen, Beijing, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, and Pudong, etc. The hoarders acquired more than 2,000 packages of wheat from Suzhou, Guandian, Wuxi, and Yangzhou, etc., and the price increased by $0.30-$0.50 compared to the previous time.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Silk Yarn and Flowers: All Southwest Groups; Shipment of Spot Yarn; Guild Meetings to Resume Today <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn is trending upwards. Merchants from the Guang and Hua regions in the south are actively procuring on behalf of Hong Kong and Yunnan, taking delivery and immediately loading onto ships. These groups show no interest in futures, leading to a majority of actual transactions in the last two days, which has strengthened the market. Regarding English yarn, the 20-count "Five Blessings" and "Shepherd" brands are performing well. This is attributed to their relatively lower prices, being approximately two hundred yuan cheaper than the 20-count "Double Horse." With exchange rates stabilizing, purchasing "Five Blessings" and "Shepherd" is considered cost-effective, and the availability of spot goods further stimulates sales.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the market price had already begun to rise due to news of Guang merchants buying the previous afternoon. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" rose by three yuan to 725 yuan. Subsequently, as the Cantonese concentrated on buying "Double Horse," the market price rose steadily to 740 yuan. Other yarn prices also increased, but at a slower pace. It is estimated that 500 to 600 bales were traded in the first half of the day. The market price for 20-count "Double Horse" rose by fifteen yuan, "Shepherd" by five yuan, and "Five Blessings" by fourteen yuan. A total of 145 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, and 25 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, news circulated that the Yarn Industry Guild on Second Horse Road would resume operations from the 16th onwards, as the curfew period in the concession area had ended, and that regular meetings would be held as usual.</p>
<p>Correction: According to a letter from Mr. Long, the figures in the previously published article "Current Status of Chinese Cotton Mills" should be corrected as follows: Under "Shenxin No. 2," it should read "55,000 spindles, 41,250 pounds"; under "Shenxin No. 9," it should read "130,000 spindles, 78,000 pounds, totaling 185 pieces 71)." This correction is specially made.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Cotton Trading: Slightly More Active <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The trading of Chinese and foreign cotton is gradually stabilizing. The opening price for Chinese cotton has shown a slight increase, while the price of foreign cotton has slightly decreased. The market activity is similar to the previous day. Shenxin No. 2 Mill purchased 300 bales of Brazilian cotton at 186 yuan (cash on delivery). Taikang Cotton Mill purchased 200 bales of Brazilian cotton at 180 yuan, to be delivered in September (cash). Other traders are slightly more active in mutual buying and selling. 300 bales of Tongzhou cotton were also traded at 125 yuan. The supply from northern Jiangsu is again robust, with 428 bales of Tongzhou fine cotton arriving. Additionally, 2,568 pieces of Indian cotton, transported from Karachi on the Italian ship "Fusijama," arrived on the 10th and were unloaded at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. The current selling prices and quantities of cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday saw a drop in the legal tender exchange rate due to the relaxation of foreign exchange controls, with a decrease of three to four yuan. Traders are waiting for better prices to sell, and are not willing to sell at the current low prices. However, mills still believe that the current cotton prices are too high, and their interest in purchasing is currently weak. Transactions among traders have also become quieter in recent days.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was rather stagnant yesterday. Prices initially fell due to telegrams reporting declines in Liverpool and Bombay. Many traders took profits, leading to a large number of long positions being closed. Simultaneously, speculators were very active in the market. As the number of long positions being closed increased, prices fell again, resulting in a four-pound loss. Indian cotton, including forecasts, lost half a rupee. Egyptian cotton rose by just over ten pounds.</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for securities was quite inactive yesterday, with neither buyers nor sellers showing much enthusiasm.

The overall situation was scattered and trending sideways, with no new stimuli, and no major fluctuations expected in the short term. The market opened quite firm yesterday, with Category C at six jiao, but lower than the previous day's over-the-counter price. Supply still exceeded demand. Dingkang, Tongshun, Zhenkang, and Lianhe all saw selling, but it was scattered and not concentrated, with only sporadic entries and exits. Daqing and Lianyi were the most active buyers, but activity was generally sparse. After the close, the market price weakened slightly by one or two jiao. The day's results showed that except for Category B, which was slightly lower by five fen, the rest were slightly better. Category D has not yet been opened. The total turnover was estimated at thirty to forty thousand yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 40 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of 50 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce was quite stable yesterday, with little price fluctuation. There were not many transactions. Conflicting rumors caused some excitement among speculators and investors. It is generally believed that one must wait for a better turn of events before making a decision. Rubber statistics continued to show progress. Electricity preference shares and bonds were slightly weaker. The price of Kaiping stock fell due to the easing of foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>London and Far East Company Shares (as of Monday, the 14th of this month) showed mostly declines. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell from £12-£20 to £10-£12. HSBC Bank (London Registered) fell half a pound to £73. Hong Kong registered shares fell one pound to £76. Gula-Kalimpong Rubber shares rose slightly by 1.5 pence to 18 shillings and 1.5 pence.

<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the oil market remained the same as before the market holiday. Market conditions were turbulent, unprecedented, and prices were exceptionally high. Soybean oil was particularly sought after due to the three-day market closure. Prices for barrelled oil soared by one to two yuan compared to the 11th, while prices for basketed oil jumped by five or six jiao. In the afternoon, speculators took profits, and selling pressure increased, causing prices to fall slightly.

<h3 id="e115">Unrestrained Indulgence in Sexual Matters: A Sign of the Decline of Love <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Among animals, except for humans, all have a fixed period of sexual abstinence. Humans alone are different. Sexual activity can occur on any day of the year, and therefore it is unlimited. This must be controlled by reason. If it is not controlled, it will be depleted daily, eventually leading to death. Confucius said: In youth, the blood and qi are not yet settled, and one must guard against lust. During marriage, the blood and qi of both men and women are precisely at a time when they are not yet settled. Like fish in water, like glue and lacquer, if they do not restrain themselves, the disaster of death will be unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to practice restraint, determining a fixed number of times. It is better to err on the side of less than to be excessive. Only in this way can one benefit from it without suffering harm. So what should the fixed number be? Generally speaking, for those who are healthy and without unsuitable circumstances, from twenty to thirty years old, at most three times a week. From thirty to forty years old, at most twice a week. For those over forty years old, at most once a week. This is because after each sexual act, the energy expended is still easily recovered. If this number is exceeded, it will be difficult to recover. Over time, the body will become weaker and the spirit will decline. Excessive indulgence is as harmful as overeating. This is what must be sincerely advised to any couple. It is often seen that newly married couples or couples who have been separated for a long time, having not engaged in sexual activity for a long time, hope to make up for it and indulge unrestrainedly. The result is often the development of various diseases, such as kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and neurasthenia, all of which stem from indulgence. After the husband suffers from these problems, the wife's opportunity for pleasure is also lost. The decline of love can be predicted. The way to remedy this lies in self-restraint. On the one hand, follow the correct medical path and take the German testicular essence preparation "Vigorex" for men to replenish deficiencies, so that symptoms such as premature ejaculation and kidney deficiency can be cured in a short time. As a physician, I can say that today's medical experts all praise the efficacy of this preparation for the treatment of the above-mentioned symptoms. This is because the preparation actively promotes the development of bones and muscles in childhood, relieves neurasthenia, promotes reproductive function, nourishes the brain and kidneys, and eliminates harmful substances from the body, transforming them into harmless substances. It promotes metabolism, rejuvenates the body and mind, and restores a happy and energetic life. According to my own observations, a person who has been injured by indulgence can be cured after taking three boxes of "Vigorex." For women, it regulates menstruation and promotes fertility.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Premature Aging <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor of Medicine Huang Zhongchang, USA</p>
<p>The process of our lives must go through youth, strength, and old age. No matter how wise, foolish, rich, or poor, one cannot escape this inevitable process. Therefore, our aging is a factual inevitability. However, many people have not yet reached the autumn of old age, but have already shown signs of gray hair and a senile state. This kind of premature aging can indeed be treated and reversed by modern scientific methods. This is a scientific truth that cannot be overturned. And the world says that there are those who return to youth, which is really deceptive nonsense. It is not worth the laughter of those who know.</p>
<p>However, at the stage of advancement of our modern science, we have been able to use scientific methods to rescue generally premature aging patients, and have already achieved satisfactory success. The first success was the "Vigorex" youth gland preparation invented by German Dr. Mellen. You must know that the youth gland is an important function necessary to maintain youth. If the function of this youth gland is sound, then we will remain undefeated during the youth period. However, most people do not have the ability to cultivate this well, and often engage in masturbation before development, early marriage, excessive sexual activity, excessive use of study, lack of fresh air, and excessive worry, all of which can hinder the development of the youth gland, and like a newly opened flower, it suddenly withers. This is why most people have the appearance of premature aging. However, today there is already a "Vigorex" youth gland preparation, which can be used to rescue it. Australian Dr. Davis conducted practical experiments at the Vienna Institute of Endocrinology and cured a fifteen-year-old youth who was suffering from muscle relaxation, wrinkled skin, and a senile appearance, looking just like a person in their fifties or sixties. The young man also suffered from palpitations, forgetfulness, sore waist and legs, and dizziness. Not only did he show signs of old age on the surface, but his mental state was also completely like that of a senile old man. After taking "Vigorex" for less than three weeks, his complexion became rosy and firm, his spirit lively, and he completely returned to the youthful type of a healthy person.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Secret to Cough Relief and Lung Treatment <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Whether it is traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, cough is a difficult to treat condition. Therefore, lung diseases are more common than any infectious disease, and their mortality rate is also truly alarming. Therefore, the general public should not regard a cold and cough as a minor ailment and neglect treatment. If, unfortunately, the cough is not treated and turns into a lung disease, then the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as generally said by physicians, as long as one takes care of one's health and receives proper treatment. There is nothing mysterious about it. According to my experience, "Bofei Nar" is a medicine that has a special effect on relieving cough and treating the lungs. Even in the case of hemoptysis in the second or third stage, it can be completely cured. However, during the treatment period, one should rest quietly, avoid exertion, and consume more nutritious foods, so that the ailment can be easily cured. This is the condition for the inevitable cure of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Patient Qin Kunyuan, 26 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang (self-reported): "I am a young worker. My body was fairly strong when I was young. After coming to Shanghai at the age of seventeen, I started working in a factory. I have a fondness for erotic books and enjoy lewd tunes. Over time, I became obsessed. Every time I sleep, I must fondle my genitals to ejaculate. At the age of twenty, I visited prostitutes several times, indulged excessively, and suffered from acute gonorrhea. Fortunately, I received prompt treatment and recovered quickly. Since then, I have been masturbating even more severely, resulting in nocturnal emissions. Initially, I only had emissions two or three times a month, but it gradually increased. Now I have emissions once a day, and sometimes without dreams. My muscles are thin, my daytime energy is poor, and I am unable to work. Although I have taken several tonic medicines, they have had little effect. Now I see in the newspaper that your organization has a treatment method, so I have come to seek treatment." (Cure process) - I ordered him to abstain from masturbation, engage in noble entertainment, and take "Nairui Spermatorrhea Tablets" before falling asleep, along with three tablets of the German testicular essence preparation "Vigorex" for men. Mr. Qin followed my instructions, and after a month, the spermatorrhea stopped. After taking it for another three months, his health recovered, his spirits were greatly boosted, and his body became stronger day by day.</p>

<p>— Described by Physician Yao Juyan</p>

<p>Our marriage is originally a union of love between two sexes, and also for the extension of the race, so when getting married, we must try our best to check the health of the other party before we can carry out our love. Therefore, eugenicists in Europe and the United States absolutely advocate that citizens with venereal diseases are not allowed to marry. Therefore, the health exchange book at the time of marriage is a necessary procedure. If our country is not the case, it is because public health is not comprehensive and people's wisdom is backward. Venereal diseases are like weeds after rain, spreading everywhere, so that it is out of control, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Among venereal diseases, gonorrhea poses a greater danger to reproduction. Therefore, before gonorrhea is cured, for the health of the individual, for the happiness of the wife, for the love of both sexes, and for the continuation of the race, it is necessary to get married again only after it is completely cured. Only then will there be no regrets.</p>
<p>Many patients who have suffered from gonorrhea often have the tragedy of infertility. After my examination, the blame rests mostly on the man. The internal reproductive organs of the male, such as the prostate, seminal vesicles, spermatic ducts, and testicles, are all important organs that bear great responsibility for reproduction and the propagation of the race. If the infection invades and becomes inflamed, it will inevitably lead to infertility and loss of function. In addition, it can also infect the wife, causing her to develop gonorrheal leukorrhea. Therefore, loving couples become enemies. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate treatment before marriage. According to Yu Gan's annual experience, the most effective treatment is to adopt German electrostatic therapy and X-ray electrotherapy with anti-gonorrhea serum. As for oral medication, "Clinong" is the most remarkable. Because this medicine can eliminate gonorrhea in all parts of the body, including the blood, joints, and mucous membranes, it can be completely cured and the right to marry restored. Consultation hours: 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. 10 consultation numbers are sent out every day, and each number costs only 5 jiao and comes with two sexually transmitted disease books worth 1 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e120">The Expense of Hiring a Maid <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— (Simon)</p>
<p>A maid with a monthly salary of five yuan; food and other expenses will amount to more than twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, the cost of living in Shanghai is really frighteningly high. The prices of everything are rising without limit, especially rice, the price of one "hu" is more than twice its previous selling price. Originally, having a maid at home didn't seem like much, but with rice prices rising, one has to think about how much it costs to hire a maid. In the past, a monthly salary of five yuan plus about five yuan for food meant an extra expense of ten yuan was enough, but now, it has to be at least doubled.</p>
<p>Last month, the old maid left, and we hired a new one. The agent's fee, the tip, the bond money, etc., cost nearly two yuan. The salary is five yuan per month. But unexpectedly, this maid had a particularly large appetite, eating three large bowls of rice per meal. Her food intake alone was the same as that of my entire family of five (two adults and three children). In other words, half of the rice consumed each day was for her alone. A "dan" of rice would only last twenty-one days, breaking our family's record for rice consumption since we started our family. The price of rice is twenty yuan per "dan," and we consume one and a half "hu" (seven and a half "dou") per month, which is fifteen yuan. What she ate was worth seven and a half yuan. However, having hired someone, you can't complain about them eating too much, so we just wagged our tongues behind her back with my wife.</p>
<p>Although we have a maid, we don't need to add extra dishes, but we do need one more bowl of vegetables, otherwise there wouldn't be enough for me. The price of vegetables now is equal to the price of meat dishes in the past, costing at least two or three yuan more per month. Therefore, hiring a maid, including salary, food, and agency fees, cost me a total of sixteen or seventeen yuan last month. And teaching her to buy groceries and other things meant she would skim off the top of everything. There are no copper coins now, so if she doesn't skim it's fine, but if she does, it's at least a few "fen." After just one month, we complained that she ate too much, and she complained that our household was too small and she couldn't skim enough. Dissatisfied with each other, we fired her.</p>
<p>The whip of life is relentlessly pressing down. After the war, we implemented austerity in everything, not spending money unnecessarily, but now, we really can't cut back any further. After discussing it with my wife, we decided to do it ourselves, saving the cost of hiring a maid, which could save more than ten yuan. Washing clothes, emptying the chamber pot, we hired a wandering cleaning woman for a monthly fee of four yuan, and did all the other work ourselves. Although we are all so busy that we can't stop, but to save money and get through this difficult era, there is no other way. It is human nature to work.</p>
<p>So, starting this month, we will do it ourselves and not hire a maid. Afterwards, the results of the experiment showed that not hiring a maid not only saves salary and food, but also saves a lot on other daily necessities. For example, coal balls, a maid would burn two "dan" a month, but when we burn them ourselves, one "dan" can last twenty-one days. Other items such as salt, soy sauce, soap, and toilet paper can all be saved. Think about how expensive things are now, so saving the cost of hiring a maid can save at least twenty yuan. In this difficult era, I dare to report our experiment to housewives who want to economize.</p>
<h3 id="e121">No Gift Movement <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Suchen</p>
<p>Defaulting on debt is better than defaulting on favors</p>
<p>Every day when I arrive at the office, when my eyes meet the documents and letters on my desk, I am often afraid of finding eye-catching red and white invitations in this pile of things. In the past, I also looked at that red smiling face and guessed which of my friends' good news it would report to me; looking at the white terror and sighing for the unfortunate friends, but now, I just quietly pay attention to it, whether white or red, it brings me fear and anxiety!</p>
<p>People naturally cannot live in isolation from others, and socializing between friends and acquaintances, the exchange of gifts, is also very normal. However, now this medium representing friendship has exceeded its bounds, some are used as an opportunity to flatter superiors, some are used to take advantage of others... I once searched through a white invitation, looking through the seven or eight lines of names listed below the "mourning sons," and there wasn't a single familiar name. Even if my memory is too bad and I forgot that I had received a business card from someone I met for the first time at some event, but since this name doesn't leave any impression on my brain, it seems we don't need to have this extra relationship.</p>
<p>In an era when the cost of living is frighteningly high, the pain of a salaried worker is greater than everything else, because an income of forty or fifty yuan can barely maintain a family's livelihood, and the so-called "scholar class" has to put on a smiling face to muddle through, how can these "worse than debt" red and white invitations not be frightening!</p>
<p>The habit of putting on a show still cannot be abolished now, which is really disheartening. The rich don't care about this little bit of money (but why not spend it on other legitimate purposes?), and the poor are borrowing money to put on a show, what's the point? To this day, not only are invitations sent for weddings and funerals, but also for sixtieth birthdays and thirtieth birthdays, with the same show. Every day, looking at the snowflakes of things flying onto my desk, I finally shouted out the title of this article: "No Gift Movement"!</p>
<p>Friends who love to show off should wait patiently for a period of time, those without money should also pay attention to the rice turning bad under the bed, and those who take advantage of others should also think about what kind of life everyone is living now. As long as no invitations fly over, the "No Gift Movement" is actually not a "movement."</p>

<h3 id="e123">The Old Maid Policy <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Lei</p>
<p>Since the customs office adopted the policy of not employing married women, due to the unreasonableness of this policy and the fact that other organizations have experience with no inconvenience in employing married women, married women today do not necessarily have no other options outside of customs. However, recently there have been rumors that the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau also wants to emulate the customs office and adopt a policy of not employing married women. This is a matter worthy of widespread discussion.</p>
<p>It is said that there are seventy or eighty female staff in the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and their duties are usually to sort and reconcile remittance slips. Although there are no accurate statistics on the percentage of married and unmarried women, it seems not too far off to say that they each account for 50 percent. Therefore, if the bureau no longer employs married women in the future, and even unmarried women are subject to the iron rule of being fired upon marriage, if you want to keep your job, you must not marry. This threat is indeed a serious blow to women's career prospects.</p>
<p>Good, the policy was initiated by the customs office, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is carrying it forward. Therefore, in order to obtain employment, women must remain single and become "unmarried Northern Palace officials." Because marriage means unemployment, in order to ensure job security, they have to regard marriage as a dangerous path. Consequently, among white-collar workers, a large number of old maids will be cultivated.</p>
<p>If a career is for life, and you marry your career, is this method reasonable? Is this measure in line with common sense? We must point out that this is an inhumane act!</p>
<p>As for work efficiency, what is the difference between the abilities of married and unmarried women? If a woman's work ability is strong before marriage, will she become much inferior and unusable after marriage? If, due to excessive workload, her health is impaired and she frequently requests leave, then the strength or weakness of work efficiency is inherently unrelated to marriage. Moreover, because social affairs are becoming more frequent and livelihoods are becoming more pressing, married women's need for employment is more urgent than that of unmarried women in order to reduce the burden on the family. This is a matter of fact, and it is not a solution to the problem of women's employment by simply decorating the office with a few young unmarried women.</p>
<p>In order to establish the foundation of women's employment in society, in order to cooperate with the task of women's mobilization in the great era, and in order to fight for humane protection of women's employment status, I think this issue should be fought for by all sisters, whether married or unmarried!</p>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves, Miraculous Scene in the Fire is Brilliantly Like a Lotus Flower</p>
<p>It turned out that Mr. He's second wife was half Caucasian through her bloodline. This was because Mr. He's father-in-law was Chinese, and Mr. He's mother-in-law was French. Mr. He's father-in-law's surname was Cheng, and he was also a famous scholar in China at that time. Mr. He's father-in-law's marriage to his mother-in-law included a touching story, which I might as well take this opportunity to briefly describe. Mr. He's father-in-law, Mr. Cheng, whose given name was Gong, was originally from Guangxi. He was a top student in China, but his family was not very wealthy. Later, he went to study in France. At that time, many Chinese students studied in France, with the goal of working while studying. Although Mr. Cheng did not do any manual labor in France, he was able to put the word "diligent" into practice in his studies. He was studying at the University of Lyon, and lived in Lyon. France is a free country, and allows for interactions between men and women, unlike China in the past, where young men and women could not meet, and if they did, there would be problems. In schools, male and female students were always used to being free. They could go out together and visit each other. If it was within certain limits, their parents would allow them freedom. At that time, there was a female student at the school named Alice. Alice was as fair as jade and as beautiful as a flower. She was only eighteen or nineteen years old, but her beauty was the crown of the school. At that time, every student in the university knew that Alice was their school's queen. But Alice was as beautiful as a peach blossom but as cold as frost, and she really had to be, because there were too many people pursuing her. Moreover, the university had students from not only France, but also from other countries. There were also sons of various dukes, children of noble families, and princes, filling the school. They were all willing to pay attention to Alice, and to gain a smile from her was a great honor. As for Alice, her family was not lowly. Her ancestors followed Napoleon on his expeditions and made some military achievements. She was also a descendant of a lord. However, the family had declined. Her father had passed away early, and her mother only had one son and one daughter. The daughter was Alice, and the son was her younger brother, who was only fourteen or fifteen years old and in middle school. Fortunately, they had inherited some property, and her mother was quite capable and managed the family well. The three of them lived harmoniously, a happy family, and considered themselves to be a middle-class family. (170)</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Skating queen Sonja Henie recently experienced a dramatic heartbreak, which she described as very painful. According to Hollywood reports, her object of affection was Tyrone Power, a German actor known for his good looks. They co-starred in many films and had a close relationship. A month ago, when Sonja Henie was expressing her passionate feelings to him, Tyrone Power also gave a special interview to the press, saying something along the lines of: "The women I admire are definitely not the mediocre ones who follow me around. They must be great and dignified. There are only ten such women in the world. For example, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of Chinese women, oversees major plans and works hard, which I admire... Also, the skating star Sonja Henie has noble character and is also talented, which I am also impressed by." Sonja Henie was secretly pleased when she heard the news. Little did she know that this was a smokescreen. Two weeks later, Tyrone Power suddenly married another star, Annabella, without a word, and left for a honeymoon trip.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie, in a fit of anger, burst into tears and was heartbroken. She is already twenty-nine years old, and her first love was a major blow. Friends felt sorry for her, and some said that she had maintained the title of "General of a Hundred Victories" in the sports arena for seventeen years, but how could she be so easily defeated in the arena of love? According to her mother, she was in a daze for several weeks after the heartbreak, unhappy. It wasn't until recently that she returned to normal, saying that she already had two potential lovers, one a British film agent and the other a young Cambridge University aviator. But she kept it a secret. When asked about marriage, whether she was learning from Greta Garbo to remain mysterious, she would reply shyly: "I don't have time to get married. I'm too busy. Anyway, I can't find a partner right now."</p>
<p>Shen's Residence Gathering</p>
<h3 id="e127">A Night of Amateurs and Professionals <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Muyun</p>
<p>Famous amateur Nan Tiesheng came to Shanghai, and the banquets from both amateur and professional circles almost made it difficult for him to be in two places at once. The other night, the renowned female amateur Shen Yuanyu of Shanghai specially hosted a banquet for Nan Tiesheng at her residence on West End Street, and invited many famous professionals to accompany him. This was a grand event, and I am reporting it to the community. Miss Shen Yuanyu is a famous lady in Shanghai and has considerable knowledge of drama. She is proficient in Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, and is good at both civilian and military roles. There are few female amateurs in Shanghai who work as hard at opera as she does. She dedicates her time to drama every day. She practices in the morning with actor Liu Junlin, practices her voice with Qinshi Xia Fubao, and learns about opera from the famous actor Furongcao. Mr. Xu Baizun teaches her Kunqu Opera. Therefore, her achievements surpass those of ordinary female amateurs. In addition to Nan Tiesheng, the guests that night included Mr. and Mrs. Furongcao, Mr. Xu Baizun, Mr. Xu Yinsheng, and female actor Xie Wenqin. It was truly "Heroes of Jiangnan gathered at Shen's residence," so the grand occasion cannot be described by words.</p>
<p>Miss Shen is skilled in photography, and the photos were all taken by her. It can be said that they are excellent. Because Nan Tiesheng will soon return north, that night was a farewell party, and everyone had a great time. Miss Xie Wenqin has always admired Miss Shen's artistry, and she especially seemed close to her. She also works hard at opera. She once studied with Mr. Wang Huifang, but because of time constraints, she didn't learn much. Tiesheng plans to introduce her to Mr. Wang Yaoqing in the future. If Yaoqing and Tiesheng work together in September, this plan can be implemented immediately. She is currently learning from Mr. Liu Juchan. Comparatively speaking, among the female actors in the South, she admires the northern style of performance.</p>
<p>The final report is about Nan Tiesheng's plans. He has made a decision. If the charity performance can be decided before the 25th, there will be no problem with him singing. If it is after the 25th, perhaps it will have to wait until September!</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Adaptation of "Ideal Wife" (Part 1) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zhang</p>
<p>It was in April of this year when the Xin Xin Drama Society was newly established. It was originally planned to premiere Mr. Lu Xun's posthumous work "The True Story of Ah Q," but due to the large number of actors required and the difficulty of recruiting actors for rehearsals by a non-professional theater group, as well as script censorship and other issues, it was not possible to perform it in a short period of time. Therefore, with the encouragement of several enthusiastic friends, this "Ideal Wife" was adapted, preparing it as the "Xin Xin" Society's first production. At that time, the director was Mr. Yue Feng. After several rehearsals, it was suspended because Mr. Yue Feng was filming at Xinhua Film Company and had no time to take care of it.</p>
<p>Speaking of "Ideal Wife," it reminds me of four or five years ago at the Lianhua General Factory in Xujiahui. At that time, during work breaks, I would bury myself in books almost all day, living a life of forgetting to eat and sleep, as if I were drunk. I remember that what most fascinated me at that time, besides I. Duncan's autobiography and several famous plays by O. Mirbeau, was this work by Molière, "L'École des Femmes" (The School for Wives). Although "L'École des Femmes" is a 16th-century French work, in terms of the content of the entire play, it has not only lost its timeliness, but is also aimed at the so-called "Paris of the East" - Shanghai.</p>
<p>At that time, I had the ambition to adapt it, and I also started writing a few pages. But when I held these pages of manuscript to visit a few friends who shared my interests, I was poured a basin of cold water on me, saying "There is no one like Arnolphe in China"!</p>
<p>When I reorganized the old draft now, I changed the identity and environment of Arnolphe. I wrote him as someone who had been gilded and was dissatisfied with divorce and marriage in Europe and the United States, as well as the union that emphasized love but not chastity. Moreover, he was also someone who was often defeated in the game of love. In this way, I thought it would be closer to the national conditions.</p>
<p>I emphasized the character of Chrysalde, writing him as someone with considerable insight. In the second act, I added a lot of dialogue between him and Arnolphe. Arnolphe advocated "choosing" when it came to marriage, while Chrysalde advocated "falling in love." Arnolphe said that he had been abroad for many years and had seen countless divorce lawsuits, all of which were the result of "falling in love." Here, Chrysalde revealed the reason for the failure of "love marriages": at the beginning of love, both sides always show their strengths and hide their weaknesses. They get married when they are in a confused state of love. As time goes by, the weaknesses are exposed, and divorce naturally follows.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said to those gentlemen who were not at ease with their wives: "If a person has a wife and is not at ease with her, he should only use his whole heart and soul to love her. Love is the magic that overcomes all hardships!" So he is victorious, and he doesn't need to think about the past and the future.</p>
<p>This comedy contains a bit of tragic element. Agnes's mother was a victim of marriage under the feudal system. She and Agnes's father secretly married, but it was not allowed by society at that time, so this illegitimate child was fostered in the countryside, separated by life and death, causing her husband to flee overseas. I think anyone who has been hurt by old-fashioned marriages can feel it deeply!</p>
<p>Here, we can also see that human nature cannot be extinguished. Agnes inherited her mother's innate tradition, being extremely clever. She has the power to resist. Although Arnolphe tried his best to make her stupid, her natural qualities of love would eventually be revealed.</p>

<h3 id="e129">"Charlie Chan's Confession" (Part 2) <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xinyuan</p>
<p>—Thoughts on Filming Detective Films</p>
<p>In fact, I think Charlie Chan is just like Sherlock Holmes in novels. There is no definite type. I just pretend to be like him. It's not like Charlie Chan, it's like Warner Oland, who was succeeded by Sidney Toler in the United States. Every move and expression of his imitates Warner Oland. In short, we Chinese people, when filming Chinese detective films, should express Charlie Chan with more vigor. This time, Xinhua Film Company is producing Charlie Chan's second case, "The Flying Corpse in the Boudoir." My makeup is the same as Warner Oland's, and my movements and expressions are more agile than before. The plot of this play is more realistic and tense than "The Pearl Shirt." It took Director Xu Xinfu several months of hard work to create this script. Detective scripts are indeed more difficult to write than any other scripts, especially Chinese detective stories, which are extremely difficult to construct. They cannot involve gods and monsters or superstitions, nor can they be close to emptiness. The elements of writing a detective script are: first, there must be many doubts and flaws, making it difficult for people to figure out; second, the foreshadowing should be clear; third, the atmosphere should be tense, making people nervous; fourth, the plot should be realistic, avoiding absurdity and nonsense. Only with these points can it meet the requirements of a detective script. As for the actors' success or failure, half depends on the quality of the script and half depends on the director's skills. Detective directors are very difficult to be. They must be brave and careful. Every shot and every line is closely related to the plot. Therefore, detective directors in China are rare except for Mr. Xu Xinfu. It can be seen that directing a detective play is much more difficult than directing other films. Secondly, the success or failure of actors mostly depends on the director. For example, when shooting a shot, the actor feels that the performance is not good enough, but the director thinks it's OK, or in a certain scene, the actor feels very good, but the director thinks it's NG. They must obey the command and should not make too many claims. Therefore, an actor rarely has control over their own success. My second detective film, "The Flying Corpse in the Boudoir," has now been filmed four-fifths. There is still a climactic and tense all-out action scene to be shot in the coming days. It is expected to meet you all in the golden autumn when osmanthus flowers are fragrant. I hope that people from all walks of life will give me their guidance at that time.</p>

<p>After rumors that a certain company intends to produce "The Civet Cat Exchanging for the Prince," there are also rumors that someone intends to remake "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" as a talkie. It is a pity that Hu Die is enjoying her blessings in Hong Kong, Zheng Xiaoqiu is fat and amiable, and Xia Peizhen is thin and scrawny, and now the film is even more expensive. I hope the friends who plan to do this will think it over carefully!</p>
<p>Wu Xiaobang has long intended to go to Hong Kong. After leaving Sino-French recently, he is even more determined to leave Shanghai. Some people have already sent a letter to Ouyang Yuqian asking him to take care of everything. It seems that the dance of "Mulan Joins the Army" may be seen by the Hong Kong public first.</p>

<p>(13) Singing and Dancing</p>
<p>Among the singing and dancing troupes in China, only the "Mingyue" and "Meihua" troupes are relatively well-organized.</p>
<p>Most of the singing and dancing girls are malnourished, and some are not fully developed. They only have bones, not flesh! Not to "increase the ambition of others," but imported goods do not have this weakness.</p>
<p>In recent years, there are almost no singing and dancing groups that can perform independently and have a strong appeal. They are only "available" in a few variety show venues.</p>
