<p>社評</p>
<h3>請以理智答覆困難</h3>
<p>關於英美兩國聯合對日經濟報復行動之必要，與其趨勢；英美大政治家應發動民衆，以觀厥成；本報昨既析言之矣。嗣據外電傅稱，英美於其實行報復，猶各有其部分之困難。如哈瓦斯社之美京電訉，謂美國國會議員之中，多主張對日採行經濟制裁手段；參議院外交委員會主席民主黨參議員畢德曼氏並作妙喩曰：「茲有人焉，可用斷食之法，迫以尊重汝之權利，又何必一定予以槍决」云。顧有反對派，如共和黨參議員波拉氏曰：「經濟制裁絕非和平措置，乃係戰爭初步辦法，余若不準備作戰，即不願實施制裁」云。兩派對峙，將如何取捨，尙難逆覩，此實行制日之困難，一也。又路透社之英京電訉，謂英政府在商業報復中所遇之一部分困難，為自治領五金業棉毛業經營日本貿易者之反對。，聞華盛頓亦為油棉廢鐵與機器等業所阻撓云。英美大商人，長袖善舞，其於國事之態度，輒有予彼國家政策以若干影響之可能，此實行制裁之困難，又一也。</p>
<p>凡此所謂困難，早為識者所心領神會；蓋英美諸國在華權利之遭受日本毀損，乃於七年前之九一八，與中國領土主權人民之遭受蹂躪，實相同時開始，絕非近頃始然。閱悠久之歲月而今始醖釀報復者：一因日本獨吞獨覇之野心，最初未為各國朝野所體認明白，以為得失僅在肥瘠之間，而非將被擯至於盡絕也。二因中國抗戰之持久與决心，最初未為各國朝野所體認明白，以為東北豎子，拱手讓人。行見重兵所至，締盟城下，即使同歸於盡，亦惟付之一歎而已。三因迷信外交功效，以為折衝　俎，日本不致於絕無禮貌，絕不講理，則抗議稍强，凶燄可殺。四因惟恐捲入遠束軍事漩渦，寗若矜持獨善。五因日本之資本機構，相當成熟，會逢世界經濟恐慌時期，各國工商界之經營日本貿易者，對此遠東主顧倍加珍視。六因民治國家之於政策，有其先天之惰性，故改變陳策與創制新策，皆非容易。七因各國未能開誠布公，每防爾詐我虞，若有利用時機而將友敵恩怨為擒縱者，則所謀不成，反受其殃。八因國際盟的與海軍協定以及軍縮運動，皆望之儼然，「一團和氣」。此八端者，頗相矛盾而雜然並存；於是在華權利雖遭毀損，而於制裁之道，報復之謀，或有所不願，或有所不敢，或以為不必要，或以為不可能，或以為不及為之而中國先敗降矣。</p>
<p>及至近頃，事實逐漸為有力之雄辯：若日本之悍然以造成所謂新秩序，而企圖關閉整個中國門戶，以遂其獨吞獨覇之野心；若中國之抗戰逾十八個月，仍能繼續發揮其偉大之堅靱，務爭最後勝利；若各國之再三抗議，徒受對方以輕蔑，椰揄，欺騙，虛浮為能事之答復；若日本之以統制貿易與現金枯竭而不復成為世界市塲之好主顧；若國際之以侵略成風而競爭擴軍於殺氣盈溢於大地；此允事實之著者。於是報復制裁之醖釀，應運而開展。顧乃猶有困難，如上述哈瓦斯與路透二社所傳者，則或為意氣所蔽，或為近利所囿，抑且不思之甚也，彼英美一部份工商界之為近利所囿者，自應由英美有遠見之大部份朝野予以理智之指示，我人不値多言。然我人欲為波拉氏及與波拉氏抱類似觀念者進一解。原經濟制裁之發動，由於保全本國合法權利之要求；若充「經濟制裁絕非和平措置、乃係戰事初步辦法」之說，則應得推論曰「余若不準備作戰，即不願實施制裁，寗願放棄本國合法權利；」波拉氏乃美國有聲望之政客，是何容心而暗示髯願放棄本國合法權利？不然，應於經濟制裁之外，提示積極可行而切實有效之保全本國合法權利之辦法！况經濟制裁與戰爭，並非必然之程序，並無必然之因果，阿比西尼亞問題之中，在英國倡導之下，若干國家對義大利實行經濟制裁，效否為另一問題，然行則確乎行矣；英義非但未嘗因此而戰爭，英國首相張伯倫氏今日方在義京為貴賓而受義國朝野熱烈之歡迎；故以制裁為戰爭初步之說，為理論所不通！即以戰爭而論，謂日本侵華之將無以為繼，乃謂將遠襲美國乎？故以制裁為戰爭初步之說，又為事實所必無！以日本之猖在，猶未敢空言恫嚇，謂以戰爭答復制裁，波拉氏不類日本代言人乎？是知波拉氏云云，祗須加以理智分析，便知絕無是處，謂實行制裁而困難在此，則必有以解脫之道矣。</p>

<h3>上海特輯　佛教與上海</h3>
<p>— 芝峯</p>
<p>（一）佛敎之本質及來中國後之變化</p>
<p>佛敎流傳，雖已有二千九百餘年之歷史，因其產生於當時世界文化水準最高之印度，加以釋迦牟尼絕大閎深之智慧，徹底證悟宇宙人生之眞理，發而爲妙辯無碍之法輪，慧日所照，黑闇爲輝，上智聞道，一言見諦。時無論古今，地無論東西，人無論種族，而宇宙人生之眞理，自絕無變異，徹底證悟眞理之輪音，亦自絕無變異；如人類對於空氣之需要，古今中外莫能異，釋迦所徹底證悟之眞理亦然，雖二千餘年後之今日人類，不能不有此眞理之需要。故我謂佛敎，是今古常新之佛敎也。</p>
<p>佛敎之本質，其說明之方式雖有各種之不同，且隨其流播時代地理民族生活文化風俗各種之不同而異其狀態，然唯異其量而不變其質。其質唯何？曰智與悲耳。</p>
<p>智者，徹底證悟宇宙人生之眞理之謂，故智之對象爲眞理：悲者，徹底救濟迷眞逐妄之有情之謂，故悲之對象爲有情。（通指人類及其他動物）。求一己之解脫，棄捨全體之有情，雖證局部之眞理而未達於徹底，是爲小智無悲消極之小乘佛敎，所謂大白牛車，非蹩驢所能運，早爲釋迦牟尼斥爲焦芽敗種者也。然世人之指譎佛敎者，偏舉類似之小乘佛敎，可憾已</p>
<p>大乘佛敎之智，綜各種修習法門以體騐眞理，證悟眞理，從妄證眞，由眞入俗，以達其無我無人無衆生無壽者衆相之虛幻，而赤裸裸徹露其宇宙人生之眞相。故佛敎本質之一之智，是爲空智，卽空其吾人傳統之成見，私心目是之偏執，抽繭剝蕉，以達於本眞。其方法雖似爲消極，其所企求獲得證悟目的之眞理則爲積極。然世人往往指佛敎爲「空門」，殊不知「空門」闢處，眞理之堂奧顯然，主觀自是之徒，未足以深言此間之消息也。</p>
<p>佛敎之悲依於智，智依於理。是以佛敎之悲，非純主觀之感情，而是依於理智應適之感情。蓋由大智證理，洞徹眞偽，天地一指，萬物一馬焉，而偏執之有情，執此非彼，捏無爲有，逐妄迷眞，長夜不旦，逞物欲而競己長，奮强權而奪公理，龍蛇起陸，慘劇繁興，人生汨沒於煩惱之河，世界淪陷爲血腥之域。良以一念迷眞，斯感共同惡業之苦果；唯有空智蕩除妄覺，　有情於自造不　之深淵。釋迦牟尼自證此理，號曰一切智人，還此理導諸迷愚，稱爲大悲聖者。非空智無以振發大悲，非大悲無以實於空智，悲智雙忘，自他一體，是爲佛敎唯一之本質。</p>
<p>縱觀佛敎之千經萬論，其闡演至上高深一貫之妙理，無足越此之本質；唯其說法表現之方式，有極簡單全露於一句半偈中，甚至於無言，有極繁複顯揚於恒河沙刧數，猶不能盡其大地之爪士，唯證乃入，餘皆葛籐耳。</p>
<p>如此極高明而簡要之佛敎，非有極高水準文化之民族，不足以接受之，遑論發揚光大哉。故南洋諸國，祗傳承其小乘，西藏蒙古諸民族，所盛行者爲其末期之密乘，而朝鮮日本，僅傳全部佛乘中之緒餘，眞能吞吐自如，發揚光大者，厥唯中國，故中國佛敎，處世界上第二祖之地位，性，相，律，密，爲接受印度原有之佛學，禪，凈，台，賢，爲中國自創之佛學，含有融化中國原有最高文化之色澤。同時研究自東漢末期以迄於今日之中國文化史者，無一不渲染有佛敎之思想，故印度之佛敎與中國之文化，幾有不能分離而爲二。</p>
<p>惜乎中國文化事業，向操於貴族階級，而讀書種子，向以儒家自居，雖陰佛陽儒之宋明理學，亦故排斥佛敎，致佛敎之眞相，除佛敎之高僧大德努力闡揚外，僅爲少數好學潛心隱居之士所涉略，與夫自命風雅之士大夫獵取一二禪話資爲淸談之助，故陷佛敎傳敎形式之門徑於狹隘之中。然而爭取基本大衆，爲建立鞏固宗敎之要素，而閎深廣大之佛敎，旣遭遇如此之厄運，乃不得不化裝以出之，抑於上者而取諸下，故禪宗以一則公案，凈宗以一句彌陀，以簡單直捷之法門，廣播化導於一般民衆之中，唐宋以來，風靡全國，影響所及，雖愚夫愚婦，亦能坐修立行，大有代表中國整個佛敎之概。夫禪宗之自力，凈土之他力，其修持方法雖不同，要其排除理解一也。佛敎眞相，下層社會，旣乏其理解力，但是求理解之需要，實爲入類天賦之本能，佛敎眞相旣無從理解，於是一切中國原有風俗之迷信，附會加入於佛敎，而無神論唯理智之佛敎，轉而流爲多神拜物迷信之佛敎，佛敎之眞精神，於是幾於全亡。（未完）</p>

<h3>浦東各界追悼　泥城死難健兒　訂於本月十五日　在某地開追悼會</h3>
<p>去年十二月十六日、日寇進犯浦東、在泥城一役、南滙保衛團第二中隊周中隊秋萍及二十七個同志戰死、現在南滙縣縣長于陶生、及浦東工農商學兵各界、爲褒揚愛國健兒、訂於本月十五日、在某地開追悼大會、現覓得第二中隊追悼周中隊及死難同志吿友軍書、附錄於后、</p>
<p>親愛的浦東各友軍武裝同志、去年十二月十四日、日寇向浦東進攻、在這次進攻中、有無數的健兒、爲着保衛國家、保護地方、而英勇地犧牲了、我們的周中隊長、及其他二十七位同志、就是構成這决光榮犧牲中的一部份、他們是中華民族最優秀的兒女、爲民族解放最堅决的戰士、</p>
<p>周中隊長</p>
<p>秋萍同志的死、在國家喪失了一個最勇敢的戰士、在我們第二中隊喪失了一位最賢明的掌舵人、在你們各友軍武裝同志前、少了一個共同反抗敵人的戰友、這損失是不可磨滅的、親愛的浦東各友軍武裝同志、死難的諸同志、在生前、你們並不認識、死後、你們認識了、因他們的光榮的犧牲、鮮紅的熱血、使你們和我們之間</p>
<p>更加接近</p>
<p>密切、我們要借着先烈的熱血緊緊地團結成一個人、共同去爲他們復仇、爲着中華民族解放事業奮鬥到底、在追悼中、我們除了這個信念、希望於友軍外、同時、還將我們這决作戰的經過、及我們的態度披陳於各武裝同志前、作爲參考、以便彼此進一步的合作、了解、第一、我們知道、這决日寇進攻浦東、在政冶上、用着</p>
<p>惡毒欺騙</p>
<p>政策、到一處召集「市民大會」、分發糖果給兒童、離間軍民感情、在軍事上、動員二千餘人、進行「圍剿」、單向我們第二中隊進攻的、就有五六百人、而我們的隊員和武器不滿一百、在敵我人數、武器衆寡優劣的對比下、我們並沒有全軍覆沒、反而給敵人以重創、道證明了只有堅决給敵人抵抗、才能生存</p>
<p>逃是滅亡</p>
<p>的道路、我們第二中隊未死的人、仍要繼續發揮這種光榮戰鬥的精神、第二、我們仍要不顧一切犧牲、去進行團結一切抗日力量、共同抗日、具體點說、只與日本帝國主義作戰、堅决反對自己人互相火併、只要是抗日的軍隊、不管是別動隊保衛團、我們都願意同他們親密的合作、在對日作戰上、我們願意</p>
<p>接受指揮</p>
<p>爲着這個信念、我們的中隊長、因不參加內戰、被人駡過「半吊子」、我們今天再宣誓、願意道個不參加內戰的「半吊子」、同一切抗日的友軍親密合作親愛的武裝同志、在追悼中、我們會面了、在追悼中、我們再申我們的信念、共同携着手、走向前去、因此來追悼我們英勇　周中險長、及死難諸同志、同時、以此吿於各友軍武裝同志、</p>
<h3>本埠日僑　繳人頭稅</h3>

<p>據本埠日文大陸新報載稱、「誰人繳此新稅」問題、現爲日當局與居留民所注意、故虹口日人界已有發生風潮之徵象、日本居留民協會對於籌募下一財政年度內所將缺少之日金二十萬元、絞盡腦汁、一籌莫展、一般日僑意見、主張應由獲戰時額外餘利者任此擔負、蓋此决中日戰事、獨彼輩大發其財也、另有一部分主張、令虹口一千五百名日本女招待、每月繳費三元、以充此項短少經費之一部分、因此輩女招待、亦於戰時佔得不少便宜也、衆料該會對於籌募所短少之經費問題、必將一番激烈之爭論、</p>

<h3>各輪核减水脚　滬甬運費續跌　謀福恩德等三輪今日駛甬　金甬已正式通車運輪益便</h3>
<p>滬甬綫裝貨專輪、原有開波·謀福·兩輪行駛、最近父經第十集團軍總司令部先後核准恩德·德平·新安納·新祥泰·四艘、速前共達六艘、恩德等三輪、均定今日駛甬、並實行核减水脚、今後仍有繼續低跌之勢、金甬間業於十日通車、陸地運輸、益增便捷、茲經現代社記者分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>三輪今日由滬駛甬</p>
<p>今日由滬啟椗駛甬之裝貨專輪、計有三艘、　中意公司恩德輪、自經核准後、原定昨日即行開航、茲以貨物擁擠、改於今午駛溫轉甬、　禮和洋行謀福輪、於十日晨山甬返滬後、原定昨日開航茲亦以卸貨及裝貨時間不及、改今晨十時駛溫轉甬、　衛利韓公司承租之新女納輪、自經核准裝貨後、定今日逕開海門、冉行　甬、但如手續不及或將暫以海門爲終點、</p>
<p>各輪核減水脚情形</p>
<p>中意輪船公司爲减輕客家負擔、便利土產運銷、故决將德平·恩德·兩輪水脚　行核减、今日恩德輪裝甬各貨運費、一律以對折計算、至由甬運滬各貨水脚、亦槪予减低、該公司並將核减水脚情形、呈報寗波防守司令部備核、又據現代社記者探悉、寗紹商輪承租之英商開波輪、自經核准裝棉後、其運費亦經由每包三元减爲一元五角、禮和洋行謀福輪駛甬裝繭、其運費亦由每句四元减爲二元五角、至其他各貨、聞將斟酌情形、併予减低、</p>
<p>滬甬運費勢將續跌</p>
<p>又據現代社記者向關係方面探悉、浙東各綫航運、因戰後輪隻减少、目滬甬禁止直航、運輸週轉不便、兼因煤價飛漲、成本加重、故各輪對於客票水脚、一致繼長增高、現時滬甬綫裝貨專輪、業已增加、故各輪爲减輕客家負擔計、同時爲營葉競爭計、乃實仃减低運費、今後尙有繼續低跌之勢、如將來滬甬直航恢復、則客票水脚、或將得度低跌、</p>
<p>金甬通車運輸益便</p>

<p>輸出土貨必須核准</p>
<p>寗波防守司令以國內土產出口、依照浙東通航辦法規定、須經核准方能裝運、今據當地商人之請求通融、特電上級軍事當局請示、頃奉復電、仍飭遵照前令辦理、凡出口之土貨、仍須呈請浙江省物產調整處審核、該司令業已通知鄞縣商會及輪船報關兩業公會矣、至於絲茶等貨出口、仍須向中國或交通兩銀行申請售結外匯、取得承購外匯證明書後、方准報關裝輪起運出口、糧食等類、則均禁止出口、</p>

<p>晨私以倫敦大條及紐約銀價仍無變動、倫敦生金縮二辨士、匯兌英對美縮三厘七、對法跌三生丁、對滬平平、美對英降零六二五、對法小一八七五、對滬縮五分，中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行早開、現貨賣價英滙八辨士四二一八七五、美滙十六元三七五、較前收、英平美縮零三一二五、開後雖外電供塞頗湧、但以銀行趁賤、樂於吸收、故無變動、滙豐掛脾及白銀平衡稅揭曉仍皆不動　此後因洋行界洋花結款有增無减、更聞日行暗中收吸、兼之銀行扳價不肯廉賣、致情勢立即步緊、英金軟至僅結八辨士三一二五、美金為十六元三五、港滙雖經錢兌業拋出、價亦隨軟至五十六元二五、近午聞沙遜塞出美金十六元二八三五、旋即難售、外電亦再度拋出、稍見回硬、午收英金几辨士三七五、美金十六元二八一二五、</p>
<p>後市蓋紗花帮曁華商投機家及洋行等扒興依然不衰、且銀行供源仍不暢、是以過程又趨軟化、美金又軟至十六元二一八七五最緊價、入後西商沙遜及國外港電等羣起爭塞不已、加以錢兌業亦力售不怠、且銀行買胃突轉艱難、致形勢重稍回定、英美回至八辨士四三七五、但不久沙遜冉售美金十六元二一八一二五、後即難售、英金更有港電塞出八辨士三九零六二五、港滙亦由五十六元一二五、回至五十六元二五、晚收銀行賣價英滙八辨士三七五、美滙十六元一二八七五，結果較前收英縮零四六八七五、美軟一八七五、港緊一二五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>

<p>證劵盤、昨日市况跌風已　、所謂公債利息、改由重慶發給之謠、在市價回漲中、已不攻自破、於此可以測知隔日之驟跌、完全為現貨之流出、而為投機份子所利用、更可測知人心仍在看好、蓋以前之猛漲、使多方無從下手、乃乘現貨湧出之機、造謠壓小、以遂其乘低吸收之志願、此種烟幕手段頗足以蒙蔽於一時、受愚者當大有人在、故昨晨開做、僅乙種仍屬疲軟、此則因隔日跌落最少、多方乘此脫手、以為得計、其他各槐均巳緩緩趨堅、其過程初為散戶買進而堅、錢帮亦有零星吸收、繼以天生號出籠頗湧、稍見頓挫、終以大豐號及散戶再起收買而轉升、故午前除乙種獨小五角半外餘已回好一角至三角、午後人心更堅、買氣愈濃、首先為十三號踴躍買進、散戶繼之、漲風漸見有力、各債冉好四角至六角、趨勢已有雲去月來之象、多日無動作之九六、忽有北帮十一及十四號多方購買抬高三角、漸露生氣、結果各債一致回漲一角至七角半不等、成交總數共的八十餘萬兀、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票買賣稍見、日前所讓有數種已有成交、前日華火柴公司股成交兩筆、前日成交六百股、價十二元五角、法幣交割昨成交一百股、價十三元七角半、滙劃交割、又華成烟草公司股成交五十股、價二十一元五角、滙劃價、餘尙無成議、</p>
<p>倫郭中國外債本月十一日（星期三）掛牌　市、僅敦中國外債本月十一日（星期三）掛牌口市、僅祇英金善後公債英發債票回升一鎊、價為五十三鎊、（按昨報英法借款英發債票降落三鎊、實係善後公債英發債票降落二鎊之筆誤、英法借款英發債票行市、仍為五十五鎊原價、特此更正）、實貨供給、本日有英金善後公債法發有印債票五千鎊售價四十九鎊半、較日前行市升半鎊、湖廣鐵路公債非德發有印債票五千鎊、售價、一十三鎊十五先令、照市抬高十五先令、又德發有印債票五千鎊、售價二十一鎊五先令、照市抬高五先令、民國二十五年完成滬杭甬鐵路借款債票七千五百鎊、售價二十四鎊半、（按此項債票、兩月前亦曾有五千鎊求售、當時索價三十五鎊五先令、）惟英金善後公債比發有印債票、現有進胃、出價四十六鎊五先令，</p>

<p>南北貨川耳至二百四十元</p>
<p>黑木耳邇以汕頭福建香港等帮去胃活動、行存漸感缺乏、但號方手貨以來源吿乏、心思極高、故四川木耳初開二百二十元、昨又升至二百二十六元、而某號見市勢緊佾、扳持不出、已喊至二百四十元、照存底單薄論、此價確有可能、查漢口什耳開過二百零五元、昨亦喊漲、惟行盤較平、茲以成本加昂、勢必逐步遞增云、</p>
<h3>大條仍平印銀縮</h3>
<p>十一日倫敦電、銀市平靜、鮮少變化、收盤後市面仍平、售者照掛牌價賣出、然進者須低零六二五、方有納胃、大條銀近遠期依然未更、又紐約電、美銀價依舊有行無市，又孟買電、印銀市况、平中稍帶恍惚、現貨與近遠期均縮一安那、</p>
<h3>貼現又昂　回出三十元關外</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、續見高漲、每千元之貼率已回出三十元大關、晨初尙平、仍在二十九元半左右、俄以求者蜂集、頓見步高達三十二元、最後價為三十一元七角半、比前日再高起二元二角半云、</p>
<h3>外幣上升</h3>
<p>昨日英純金回跌二便士、英美滙兌回降六二五、外匯因外電供給未旺、而洋行結款特盛、銀行投機商吸納亦殷、市價甚緊、午後結款稍稀、銀行微有塞出、市價稍回鬆、較前晚美雄稍軟、英滙更弱、烚赤廣帮搜購甚力、散戶亦多加碼吸納、供給米旺、市價緩步高漲、重出二千元關、處此抗戰時期、遊資充斥、烚赤交易、誠難跌而易漲也、外幣需耍尙旺、遭外匯軟弱、烚赤高漲影響、多數尖銳上升、勢呈堅俏、公會交易甚稀、僅同豐出仁泰進香港票一千元、昨日市價、英金鎊升二角、英金票升二角、美金鎊升二角、美金票升四分五厘、香港票升八厘、荷蘭票升一分五厘坎拿次票升五分、斐律濱票升一分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>疋頭　白貨現銷續而不斷　客帮色布需要絕旺　東疋坯布抵補仍急</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>國布白貨現銷續而不斷、昨以紗市回昂、人氣鞏固、細布。細斜手貨散額、頗有按市廉一二角轉銷、惟多數認為週前巨額去貨、不久即當有回頭生意、屆時滬埠存額旣枯、市價更有上趨之望、故意態殊為堅定、廠盤允見高昂、粗布市盤轉漲、十叫磅需額最巨、新裕地球粗布每疋提高二角半售開、餘貨漲五分之譜、現銷以本街印染業坯布交易最暢、多數係交解定額現貨細斜成交亦達一百餘包、香港帮白貨添辦稍盛、成交細斜。粗斜。粗布八十件、色布。色剁需要極旺、汕泉帮奮力搜辦、成交三百餘箱甬、甌帮所辦亦以色布色斜為大宗、共購二百餘箱、浙。贛沿綫金華廣豐等地、需貨亦亟、由本埠批發號代辦綸昌。申新·永安各廠白貨花色貨各廠藍布色斜。及元芳羽綢西緞等貨三千數百疋、蘇北及無錫常州各地辦藍布色斜二千餘疋、本街需額允大、染廠不敷供應、市面跌後轉昂、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>回漲五分至一角、良以行盤緊俏、貨底空虛、本街染布業以色布色斜客銷續暢、對於坯布抵補仍急、昨日成交又達一千件左右、內外廠四君子、直貢嗶嘰本街批發莊進胃甚健、成交一百餘箱、現貨缺乏、價亦堅挺、內外印花貨上海廠各檔粗布、本街交易亦繁、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日疋頭出口、計二百二十件運寗波、三百七十件運汕頭、五十件運香港、七十件運海口、三百四十五件運海防、</p>
<h3>雜糧　麩皮忽起　劇烈變動　出口問津造成漲風</h3>
<p>麩皮市面一度回軟後、昨日出口帮續來問津、晨初即呈活潑氣象、阜豐廠大包麩由止日二元九角半滙劃價、即跳漲至三元、入後逐步挺秀、買氣甚盛、囤戶紛起爭辦轉瞬造成劇烈漲風、午後成交價達三元一角、現鈔、結果收盤價為三元一角半、約計總成交數的在三萬包之上、</p>
<p>今麩皮出口有三百包運寗波</p>
<p>又豆子出口、今日有七百包運汕頭、一千五百包轉香港、又有豆餅四千丸百七十片、生仁三百廿包、均於今日運在汕頭、</p>
<h3>藥材廣皮新貨將到</h3>
<p>新會皮曾因貨缺、最高價每担售一百四十元、嗣後來貨陸續有到、於是勢漸軟化、步低至一百元、圾近據產區報吿、新貨出數甚豐、目不日將有大量運滬、因此冉度下跌、昨日某號售開高貨為九十元至八十五元、苟銷路呆滯、尙看續疲、</p>
<h3>海味純白魚皮旺銷</h3>
<p>魚皮類中之白魚皮、係以原貨經人工剷除外沙而成、純白而略帶透明、入水浸發、便可烹食、手續較簡、故庖人咸樂用之、如本埠及客帮俱有採辦、惟近以出貨無多、而銷路活潑、勢頗俏利、其價售一百六十元至一百五十元云、</p>
<h3>糧食　米由車輸來者　較爲湧旺</h3>
<p>粳米</p>
<p>昨共抵河下五號、車輪萬餘包、人心更餒、本街仍尙觀望、囤戶進少出多、包子去路動而不爽、各貨做開有限、市面再度下游、厚薄粳步落數分至一角、杜洋尖埠尖及陰變元悉軟近角、不過晚市趨勢、似較定平、蓋貨主以成本關係、俱有待機再售之意，</p>
<p>客秈</p>
<p>昨到頭較湧、而消化反懈、且有少數客囤求脫、成交數則不足一千包、市乃繼續下趨、高蕪秈冲南京秈者雖開至十元〇五角、然普通高貨已小至十元左右、南京秈高貨到稀擯守、中决亦復跌落一角至一角半云、</p>
<h3>糧商訂購　洋粉五萬餘包　價祇四元五角現鈔　已與申粉售價相埒</h3>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>昨現粉市况、穩定如故、連日客銷方面、零星去化、尙不示弱、良以舊曆年關期近、對於年貨需要、漸有發動、惟廠方目下生產不豐、迄無大量足資供給故、市塲交易僅能少烽敷衍而已、其售價亦屬漲落兩難、結果依照原盤、做開礮車·兵船。天竹等二號共三萬包左右、南北兩帮合辦二萬餘包、本街零批的計八千包、廠盤仍為叫元九角、下脚粉乏貨無市、今日有粉三千五百包運新港、三百包運寗波、一千二百五十包運汕頭、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>日昨小麥市况、亦鮮特色、車輪來源、的計二三千包、到貨仍以江北浦鎭及滁州等麥為大宗、各廠進胃、較前為增、因前定洋麥尙未裝到、本麥需要見殷、統市售開各麥共一萬包、仍由福新阜豐兩廠各半辦去、最高價六元七角、中現貨微有參差、又麥子咋由新港來一千包、</p>
<p>又訊</p>
<p>自戰後沿海各口岸、先後淪為戰區以來、糧食來源運輸、因種種關係、頗感困難、於是洋粉麥趁機侵入傾銷、連日洋商廉價兜攬洋粉聲中、已適應本市糧商之需要、聞某某等糧商新定美國洋粉共五萬餘包、價祗四一兀五角（現鈔）、再加統稅雜費、已與申紛售價相等、聞該粉的於下月二十後可抵滬云、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵獨銷</h3>
<p>五金交易、近甚閑散、行情在近日外匯緊縮中、尙能擯持不跌、獨二百磅會司鐵交易、昨有天津福州等帮、爭相收辦、本街廠家亦略有點綴、市情極好、且新貨到者不多、存底單薄、因此市價愈挺、每箱由五十二元七角、暴跳至五十四元，而市塲中喊價已到至五十五元、查昨交四五百箱、由北蘇州路一帶五金號售出、觀後市情形、殊甚樂觀、</p>
<h3>紗花　華棉價格嫌高　外棉長驅直入　大有後來居上之勢　印棉進口一萬餘件</h3>
<p>外棉市價、美棉因現貨額子較少、而國內各紡織廠恐己所欲求等級之美棉、亦被農民輸入貸款處作押款之用故日來國內各廠仍有大量交易、然國外輸出額、未見激增、昨日棉市堅定、印度帮在紐的購進十月及十二月份遠期、各現貨商亦有購進、結果上漲三至六磅音、遠期漲十餘磅音、印度棉市甚為平穩、漲二五羅比、埃及連跌已有數日、昨回漲三十餘磅音，昨滙兌較軟、折合法幣棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲四角餘、印棉漲二角、埃及漲二元五角、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易印棉仍旺盛、印棉平果兒已比火機每担反廉一一元餘、二十支白洛區較通州亦廉二元餘、各廠對印棉已大量訂購、日來各廠之購買火機姚花、係應急需耳、按照目前現勢探測、二三月後、本棉將有斷絕之虞也、昨有大批印棉進口、計一萬一千八百七十五件、係由印度喀勒支Karachi運來、內有二千七百七十五件、為英商福家洋行採辦、其餘均為日商所購云、茲將成交件額及現貨價格分列於後、</p>
<p>（一）昨日成交件額申新進印棉一千包又　進巴西棉　五百包上海　進印棉　一千包公大　又　一千包內外　又一千包同興　又　五百包裕豐　又　一千包東華　又　一千包</p>
<p>（二）外棉折合市價列左原料類別碼頭交貨外稅六十支埃及棉高級一〇二。一五</p>

<p>本棉生意大淸特淸、藍以各廠日前購訂外棉太鉅、目下陸續抵滬、日見擁擠、廠需有餘、兼之華棉價格高昂不鬆、而外棉市價依然平疲如故、因此廠商皆持觀望態度、非遇亟需、不願採辦也、於是交易幾入於停頓之途、日廠自紅盤開始以來、對於華棉購辦殊稀、本日申新廠購訂之印度平果爾粗絨棉可代替火機花及姚花之用塲、價格僅五十八元半現鈔、且可送廠、不過顏色比較暗黝也、蘇北一路來源尙爽快、計通州花一千七百九十一包、北沙來三百四十件、新港來三百五十件、今日聞有棉花四十件運汕頭、茲將現棉成交額量並市盤列左、</p>
<h3>紗業收買棧單貨　棉紗跌勢暫定　烟台有統制匯兌說　日紗運北劃算不通</h3>
<p>紗市穩而靜、氣勢復轉翻翔、蓋以連跌兩日以來、二十支雙馬比頂高峯時已回落至（昨日低價見三百八十二元）二十一元、大衆意見、謂邇來金融寬舒、此番實需復不惡、各廠存貨减少、棉紗本身上比較可鞏固一着、因此同業靜極思動、突來收買棧單貨、同時浙東方面及華南一隅雖無巨量發展、然零星採辦、續而不斷、於是人心良好、市面轉弱為强矣、</p>
<p>查昨日市塲情形、晨初開盤承上日大戶收進之餘氣、市態安定、浮多亦無急售之樣、故開價加一元、有人來進、繼以某某等都來拖進棧單貨、再緊一步、徐徐而升、雙馬最後價做至三百八十九元、不過實需未見十分起色、未免美中不足也查上午成交統計一千〇十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲五元、特金城漲九元、天女漲四元、牧羊無甚軒輊、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城五十包、價為三百九十五元至九十六元、今日出口棉紗有二百八十件運汕頭、九十五件運香港、九十五件運廣州灣、一千三百六十五件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列下、同行究五溫州三五內地　二五福州　二〇雲南二〇汕頭　三〇北帮　二〇四川一〇合計一、〇五</p>
<p>日紗市情、暗無生色、蓋以各方需要不暢、因此市價殊難前進、又有一設、烟台亦由日人統制滙兌說、日紗裝運北方劃算不通、故人心允挫、二十支水月現貨價三百十一元、藍鳳現紗價三百〇八元至〇七元云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球日出二千噸　猶不敷銷</h3>
<p>煤球自開歲以來、因天氣嚴塞、銷塲驟增、大小各廠、日夜動工、每天出貨二千餘噸、仍嫌供不敷求、因此行情轉堅、暗鬥之風、無形消滅、同行自車、義泰興煤球每噸三十三元、南洋雙龍脾煤球三十二元、送到加車力一元、門莊零售每担一百斤、售洋一元七八角左右、</p>
<h3>白屑回落</h3>
<p>白煤屑高檔貨、近以去路呆滯、市况已難支站、因本埠存底充實、而來源絡繹不絕、貨方覩此情景、不得小削碼拋出、某號賣出雖與决貨對搭、但去數終屬有限、日昨市塲開出鴻基一號屑三百噸、每噸祗售念八元、較上週回落一元、二號屑每噸念二元、反見生色云、</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>渝市推行戰時民教　陳教部長發表談話　注重公民教育之實施　教學時間縮短為二月</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）敎部鑒於時機之迫切、動員民衆、刻不容緩、特發動戰時民衆補習敎育、前在漢曾一度實施、頗見成效、最近又在渝市繼續辦理、各民衆學校、業已開學、陳部長特發表談話、喚起社會人士注意、茲誌其原詞如下查失學民衆補習敎育、中央於二十五年秋起施行、規定在六年以內、應將全國超過義務敎育年齡之失學民衆、均能受到四個月之補習敎育、不幸實施甫經一載、蘆溝橋事起、全國陷於戰時狀態、敎部以鑒於時機之緊迫、動員民衆、刻不容緩為適應目前緊急需要、以收發動民衆之實效起見、特實施戰時民衆補習敎育、一面將敎育內容及方法酌量變更、一面將敎學時間縮短為二個月、其內容特別注重公民敎育之實施、前在武漢時、曾一度試辦、頗見成效、最近又在重慶市繼續辦理自十月二十四日起、計有六百所民衆學校開學、入學文盲三萬人、其應請社會人士明瞭者、有下列三點、</p>
<p>（一）教育內容</p>
<p>國家舉辦敎育、最淺顯之目的、在養成健全之公民、當茲抗戰期間、允應注重於公民知能之培養、以期担負起抗戰建國之重大使命、故戰時民衆敎育之內容、除識字敎育外、並特重公民敎育之實施、注意民衆意識之激發、抗戰知能之培養與戰時服務精神之發揮、是以每月敎學時間之分配、規定公民訓練、（包括精神講話、時事報吿、戰時常識等、）為三分鐘、唱歌（大都關於發揚民族意識之歌曲）為二十分鐘、國語占五十分鐘、且在校學生、均有民權初步及一般政治活動之訓練、畢業後、並施以各種戰時組織、故此項戰時民衆補習敎育之內容、不僅為識字已也、</p>
<p>（二）設施方法</p>
<p>過去各地所辦之識字敎育、大都用引導或規勸方法、招攬民衆入學、而一般民衆、對於入學、向無習慣、往往怠忽從事、以致敎者諄諄、聽者藐藐、收效甚微、殊不知敎育為國家事業、政府旣有辦理敎育之責任、而人民亦有享受敎育之義務、且此項戰時民衆補習敎育、為適應戰時需要之特殊措施、重慶人口衆多、規定應於一年內普及、為謀迅速推行起見、特採用强迫方法施行、利用保甲組織、及行政力量、將文盲抽調後分派各民校敎學、俾收速效、</p>
<p>（三）動員知識份子</p>
<p>知識份子平時受國家之培育、已享有優先之敎育權利、本先知覺後知、先覺覺後覺之精神、原負有敎育民衆之責任、當此抗戰時期、知識份子之表現、至為熱烈可佩、今戰事更超嚴重、亟望人人起而為國家從事於最神聖之義務、蓋敎育為國家事業、决不能全持政府一方面之力量辦理、而必須由全體人民之一致協助推進、故重慶市戰時民衆補習敎育、所需師資、除一部份由政府出資延聘外、並發動知識份子、一致參加義務担任民校敎師、有力出力、有智力者、自應出其智力、為全國服務、以盡抗戰建國之責任、敎部社會人士、對此具有重大意義之事業、多予恊助、俾得順利進行、而完成此時代所賦與之使命云云、學校概况</p>

<h3>賀「新人」</h3>
<p>— 王隱</p>
<p>過新年，照例是要做「新人」的。</p>
<p>照一向的習慣，自然是換一身新的衣服，到處去擺一擺。然而就是這一點，在目前的中國也實在難辦得到。一般人連飯還吃不到口裏，換新的衣服的事是談也不要談了。自然我所說的只是一般下等人。</p>
<p>一部份上等人却就不然。雖然說是「國難」，可是依然還會穿起新的衣服到處去擺一擺。——不過這話還不對，因為那種上等人就是不過新年，也還常穿起新的衣服在到處擺着。那麽，在這新年的當兒就不能做「新人」了嗎？那却又不。他有另外更好的方法在</p>
<p>一架飛機一坐，飄飄然飛到安全地帶，發一通電報，替敵人把陰謀的計劃下一番烟幕的註釋，準備從此陞為「新中國」的創造者。這一鳴驚人，便是更澈底的做「新人」的方法。</p>
<p>從前過年，總在自家底門上貼起「天下太平」的紅條子，那時代是已經過去了。現在有的是電報，而且文字也進步了，可以演繹成一千多字的長文，播於全國。還有，從前就是到處去擺一擺，也不過只限於家門口而已。現在却有飛機，一擺就擺得很遠。這也確是二十世紀非常時期底過年法。</p>
<p>但是「新人」自已却並不承認這種舉動是為了做「新人」的，他有他底術語，曰：「犧牲」。</p>
<p>據報載：「新人」底左右曾發表談話，說是各方對於「新人」，似應暫時靜觀，因為「新人」富有犧牲精神，依彼猜想，决不致誤國至如此地步云云。</p>
<p>犧牲精神自然是很好的。不過照我們底經驗，凡口頭說是犧牲的，却實在未必是犧牲。譬如罷，前綫上抗戰的兵士，並不說他們是犧牲，而實際却眞是犧牲的。就是連飯還吃不到口裏的難民，也不說他們是犧牲，而也是老實犧牲的。但是今年過年時的上海，依然有不少的商店在掛起了招牌，寫着「廉價大犧牲」，雖然也說是為了「國難」，可是誰也不相信那是眞話。——但倘只說「精神」是富於犧牲，自然也不能算錯。</p>
<p>至於呌各方「靜觀」却還是老法子。那是說：看我變把戲罷，你們只「延頸以待」好了。但是這種　子伸長的結果是甚麽，大家都是知道的。「猜想」兩個字也妙得很。原來電報中的話都是由「猜想」來的。大概我們底「新人」這樣一「猜想」，敵人便非「退兵」不可了。</p>
<p>閑話少說，「新人」本是一位詩人，且賦詩一首以賀之。詩曰：</p>
<p>維新班首屬先生，忙煞新年求太平：</p>
<p>半日飛機恭喜去，一通電報驚人鳴；</p>
<p>靜觀好使民延頸，猜想能敎敵退兵。</p>
<p>廉價街頭看出賈，精神同是富犧牲。</p>
<h3>鴨子寨</h3>
<p>— 徐齊</p>
<p>天上結着陰霾，風在半空裏打旋子，我們一行人的鼻子全都吹紅了。</p>
<p>山巒一叢父一叢，無邊無際地，羅列在廣漠的原野上，公路像一條條吒蛇，從山脚　到山腰，軍用車儘忙碌地駛　。在這種氣候裏，司機人很　率地揭去了車頂上的偽裝。</p>
<p>我們檢着偏斜的小道搜　前進。</p>
<p>馬憨子好幾次拉開了闊　想笑，都給我們喝住了。提起他，倒也有點兒來頭，十三歲起就吃着黑道上的飯，山東　裏沒一處不跑到，二十年工夫，把他練成了一個天不怕地不怕的人物。可是就有這點兒　病，這麽大的漢子，還是孩子氣，成日價憨頭憨腦，沒一　兒安靜。現在要他掩掩隱隱地趕路，眞像他自家說的，比裝女人還困難。他輕輕地對着我的耳朶說：</p>
<p>「憑着咱一天數决在抱　　上米去的能耐，幾個毛鬼算什麽！」</p>
<p>有幾决我被他引得幾乎要開口，都給喬鏢的白眼一睜，就縮進去了。</p>
<p>老喬眞有點兒像老前輩，那一部落腮鬍，兩顆電光似的眼珠，眞敎人望而生畏，這也許就是營長特地派遣他領導我們的理由。</p>
<p>蕭老四與曹得福是老表，都是從正式部隊出身，並且都是曹州人。只有我一個是南方人，抗戰一開始，我就脫了竹布大衫，丟了禿筆，加入軍隊了。</p>
<p>我的履歷使他們成了取笑的把柄。</p>
<p>「陳秋風！猴崽子！談相拆字嗅臭脚！」</p>
<p>「這眞是豈有此理，江南人生的文弱，可是那一項比你們差呀？談相拆字也是營生呀！哼！」</p>
<p>我就用這一類說話來報復。</p>
<p>現在，誰都沒有說話了，脚一步一步向前趕，我因為要顯一顯江南人的手段，一點兒都不肯落後，一隻手按緊了這桿七九，絲毫不放鬆。</p>
<p>夜幕悄悄地撒下來，山嶺都加成紫黑色。喬鏢用三個字指一比，又劃了一個十字，這吿訴我們離開鴨子寨還有三十里。以出發時比別人快，再加路上沒有停留來預測，我們這一小隊應該第一批占先。</p>
<p>路，三十里—二十里—十里。</p>
<p>老喬的嘴唇突然噓了一下，示意我們靜肅與迅速，在前面隨時有發現敵人的步哨底可能。於是，我們都蹲下了身子走路了。</p>
<p>道路愈走愈分歧，一不留神就要兜老大圈兒。幸虧五人中四個都是行家，我們已接近鴨子寨主峯的山麓了。</p>
<p>蕭老四眼快，發見前面有人。</p>
<p>五個人全都臥倒了。</p>
<p>「砰！」老喬朝天試探一槍。</p>
<p>「砰！砰！砰！不多不少，三聲回報的訊號。</p>
<p>「好了！是自家！」我們一骨碌就起來，往山上走去。</p>
<p>「口令？」松樹下一長一胖兩個傢伙，裝得挺神氣地。</p>
<p>「××××！」</p>
<p>長子微微冷笑一下，很驕傲地：「「早哇？」</p>
<p>我們一批人都給問得臉紅了。</p>
<p>「可有肥兒？」老喬問：</p>
<p>「不多，十幾個毛鬼，一起了啦！」</p>
<p>馬憨子氣得睜着眼珠，張大了闊嘴，活像一隻蝦蟆，拉拉對方的衣襟說：</p>
<p>「好小子，眞有種！咱不及你！」</p>
<p>我們全都笑了。</p>
<p>整個的鴨子寨已浸在黑夜中了。</p>
<p>且說「家」　郭尼迪</p>
<p>又是一歲底閒始了，文壇上照例總該有一番新氣象。「元旦試筆」，「迎民國某某年」之類的文章，我們已看過了。「追悔過去一，「希望未來」，也看見過不少，雖說近似「點綴」，但亦合乎人情；只要不致於「粉飾太平」，那也可减除少許「汗顏」的心理吧。</p>
<p>自己從小對於節日的觀念就淡薄得可憐，較大時，簡直把它忘掉得一乾二淨。但今年倒不免有些感觸，想來，第一大槪和抗戰有關。而我要說的，倒不是什麼黨國大事，小得很，一個切身的問題，那是「家」。東北淪落，那時我還是個托庇在「家」底母翼下的小雛，聽了校裏敎員們動聽的報吿，說那邊無數的同胞流離失所，遭了無「家」之災，脆弱的心靈上不禁慘然。誰知從去年起，竟也碰到了同樣「有家難歸」的命運。現在　不致露宿街頭，住的地方也上面有着屋頂，論身份却是個食各。不過，被食的不是什麽孟嘗君之流，却是一家並非達官貴人的親戚。因此也就無閒可幫，照理該是够閒了的。誠然，閒則有之，但却「够」得發慌。孩子們成羣吵鬧，收音機整天價響，弄得讀書寫字，一一不能自由，感慨之餘，不免要想到「家」了。然而請看：「咱之山林，今春由×兵為首，放火焚燬，四哥六哥山林，併所有屯中左近山林，均被焚燬，理由為防制入夏窩藏胡匪，屯民莫不呌苦連天，明春家中燒柴，將何以處？」</p>
<p>眞是，將何以處呢？上面祇是東北一角的寫眞，由此也可得知×軍德政之一斑了。雖則我底家鄉並無山林苗圃，但鷄鳴畜類却不少。幾月前的報上就曾戰過一段×軍捉鷄妙法的消息。在淫威之下，畜類也已不寗，何况于人？</p>
<p>自然，其它的德政還多得很。槍斃，殺頭，本是他們的一貫作風，聽得也厭了。然而我不由的暗呌一聲慚愧；苟安在繁華十里的洋塲上，得有閒情逸致看些誨淫的消遣文字，幸福也太够高人一等了。</p>
<p>但一想到一家」，總小免有內疚。</p>
<h3>海風曲</h3>
<p>— 羅昔</p>
<p>海上澎湃，風在呼號。岸邊山畔，漁人們的血液已流紅了茫茫的碧海，靑靑的野草。</p>
<p>海是漁人們的家，捕魚是漁人們的生涯；千代百代，沒有誰人會離開這美麗的漁邨，這多魚的港　。</p>
<p>由天邊浮來了巨大的艨艟，把漁人們的血液染得一片鮮紅。</p>
<p>誰敢出海，誰就不能歸來；誰敢回家，誰就會死在刀下；漁人們的胸膛，漁人們的頸項，天天開着紅花。</p>
<p>這，這是什麽世界哪！</p>
<p>刀口外的漁人不敢出海，不敢回家。在荒僻的郊野，入們怒號，人們喧譁：</p>
<p>「我們要回家，我們要港　，我們不能餓死在荒野！」</p>
<p>「橫竪是死，不如和他拼去吧！」</p>
<p>於是，男人拿起魚叉，女人拿起石塊；為了要漁邨，為了要港　，漁人們，已沒有一個會起害怕。</p>
<p>海在澎湃，風在呼號：血與血在漩流，肉與肉在搏鬥，在漁邨裏，在海灘頭。</p>
<h3>歧途　（中）</h3>
<p>— 雲展</p>
<p>「二毛嫂，不是這麽說法的。」劉二感喟地說着：「困難時候，肯帮助，才是好朋友，好親戚。上個月還是我母親生病呢，我巴巴的向娘舅借一些醫藥費，數目不够，倒也罷了，還聽了許多敎訓，看了許多嘴臉，我恨不得當時就把錢擲還給他。所以我現在走這條路，為了一家子的口，也呌逼得我沒法，這當口是除了會弄錢之外，什麽都不放在人家眼裏了。」</p>
<p>這話正道着了二毛子的心，方才的厭惡變得有些憐憫起來。</p>
<p>「還不是！這决只有你還看得起我們，我是永遠忘不掉的。」她說時對二毛子飄了一眼。</p>
<p>「好說，好說，自己朋友，好帮忙的地方應該大家帮帮忙的。只是我們都是吃够了××人苦頭的人，照二毛哥的性子，願意不願意，也很難說。我呢，已經跳上了虎背；不去呢，只有活活的餓死。路絕無君子，眞呌做『逼上梁山』。二毛哥假使有別的法想，那當然不必去擔這個惡名聲了：吾則呢，我想暫時去混一下，躱躱雨，彼此也有個照應。不過我勸是不勸的，應常自己有個决定。我為着這事情，也接連的好幾夜睡不着呢！」話是那麼的誠懇。</p>
<p>二毛子望望朋友，望望女人，想想自已的處境，和平日心頭的憤怒，當着這生，死，榮，辱的歧途，一時竟使他開口不出。立起來，遞一枝香烟給劉二，擦上火，慢慢的說道：「二哥，我現在心思亂得很，明天給你答覆吧！去便去，不去呢，……我們大家撒開手！不過你的好意我是很感激的。」</p>
<p>「好吧。」劉二理會了他的意思，噴一口長烟，立了起來，「那末，我去了，再會！」</p>
<p>「再會，再會！」二毛子送到門首。</p>
<p>他老婆目瞪口呆的抬不起身來。</p>
<p>『到底請那一位好呢？』</p>

<p>國醫與食養</p>
<h3>何謂「食養」</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>孫總理曰：「中國文化，事事落後，惟飲食之道，爲世界所不及」。近仳醫藥，發明最進步者，曰「營養論」，曰「營養療法」，舉世崇之。然此說在中國實早已發端，周禮設醫官日「食醫」，專司食物養療之事，謂之「食養醫學」。淮南王著「食經」；竺暄著「饍　食療」食療：孫思邈著「古今食治」；孟詵著「食療本草」，以及食物本草約百除種，所言皆營養學說。發明之早，研究之細，足令西方人士駭嘆。今之業國醫者，人人知忌口及食物調養之事，所謂「醫食同源」者是也。日本中尾博士得燉煌石室之「食療本草」，對於中國營養療法，推崇備至，著爲考證，爲一時所重。乃吾國於此反少提倡，寗非憾事？今本刋以介紹國醫常識爲經；以食物治療食物養生爲緯，故定其名曰「國醫與食養」，識者匡敎焉。</p>
<h3>開胃妙品</h3>
<p>— 丁濟華</p>
<p>消化不振，胃口呆頓，每爲日常致病之由·今有一物，其名爲「焦大麥」者，藥店皆有出售·又上海方面常有浦東老婦沿路高呼出售「焦大麥；麥門」者，即屬此種大麥，其價較廉，大洋三五分可購。如以大洋三五角能購極多數量，用時取大麥少許，一煮即成，狀如紅茶。</p>
<p>「大麥茶」其味甘香可口，能便人人愛飲。吾人平時如遇胃呆，飽滿，百物無味之時，得大麥茶香味，入口即覺其香氣開胃可口，少時胃部似空空知飢。</p>
<p>大麥茶功能開胃·通氣·利濕·消食。</p>
<p>冬季進補時，可以不用茶葉，改吃大麥茶·婦女久有肝氣者，夏季會患疰夏者，或時有腸胃病者，宜飲大麥茶。煎時特別求濃，確有功效。價甚經濟，味亦可口，開胃消食，確能防止許多病恙也。補品小譜</p>
<h3>羊肉</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>羊肉爲陽性動物，冬令食之較爲相宜。因羊肉性溫熱，富脂肪質，而人體一入冬令，則正需熱量與脂肪也。羊肉有補氣血，生肌肉之功，其脂油可潤燥治癆痢。羊乳功效勝於牛乳，能治反胃吐逆。羊肝可淸熱明目，息風殺蟲。羊腎可補腰，壯陽，兼療淋帶。痰多火旺及肝陽血熱之人，皆不宜多食。患各種血症者，允應摒絕。</p>
<p>按金匱治蓐癆方，用當歸生姜羊肉湯，大補氣血，功勝參著，至烹煮時宜合海參，蘆菔，栗子等同煨，則味鮮而允補。加胡桃煮羶氣較少。有時邪瘧痢，疳疸脹滿霍亂痧痘，瘡疥諸病者亦均忌之。</p>

<p>秋令迄冬，民病除應時之瘧痢秋溫而外；以患脚氣及腫脹者爲多。脚氣之說，古所未有，自晋蘇敬，始創此名：然腫痛麻頑，即內經所謂痺也；緩縱屈弱，即內經所謂痿也；甚而上衝者，即內經所謂厥逆也。東醫松井閱·曾以素問厥論爲綱·著爲脚氣方論；而澹齋源養德之脚氣類方，則謂脚氣諸方，唐宋爲正，元明以降，說多　空·故澹齋之類方，多採自唐宋；金邨亮之脚氣鈎要·亦專採唐宋以前之方·今西醫以脚氣爲體中缺乏乙種維他命之所致·有乾性濕性急性之分·病狀不同·治亦有別·吾人以爲偏於風則自汗是注·偏於寒則掣痛攣急·濕盛則重者腫滿·熱盛則躁渴燔灼·其少腹頑痺不仁者·脚多不腫，頑痺而致於嘔悶喘急，則脚氣衝心·允極阽危，總當隨證施治，而於治療，服藥之外；更當居住高燥之地，多食穀類之粰秕及胚芽，如米之糠，麥之麩，所含乙種維他命最富，乃食者必如鋤惡之務盡，實爲取糟粕而棄精華，故吾人平時以食糙米爲佳，而點心中之麥片，菜肴中之拷麩（即麵筋）允宜多食也。</p>
<h3>血症食養法</h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>凡患肺病咯血，腸熱瀉血，及平日氣體不充，素有血虧症象著，除服藥外，均可兼用食物治療法。其最適宜之食品，計有四種。試列舉如下：</p>
<p>猪肝　性微溫而無毒。含鐵汁最富，有補血之功，而無猪肉生痰之弊。取湯或煮食均甚相宜。本草綱目云，肝主藏血，故血病多用之。千金翼治痢疾有猪肝丸，治脫肛有猪肝散，諸眼目各治方多有猪肝散，皆此意也。</p>
<p>菠菜　其莖柔肥中空，葉綠膩而厚根赤味甘美，內含滋養料極充足，試以指揑之，可見一種脂肪質，遠　他種菜類爲多。近人共稱菠菜爲富有鐵汁之食物，最喜食之。儒門事親云：凡人久病。大便澀滯不通，及痔漏之人宜常食菠菜。滑以養竅，自然通利，功能滋潤腸胃，增補血液，血虧內熱者，用以佐餐，大有裨益焉。</p>
<p>藕藕　性甘平而濟，功能生血化瘀。主治一切吐血不止，口鼻出血，產後血虧等症。搗汁多飲，功效極良，藕粉眞者亦好，此物性專止血養血，而無耗傷眞元之患，藕節則　性較强，善於止血破瘀，如失血後補血，則以用藕粉爲佳。</p>
<p>銀耳　爲樹膠性營養品，生於靑岡木上，無枝葉，形如耳，故又名日木耳。性甘平，養陰淸潤·能治崩中，漏下，血痢·下血。據近人之研究，治婦女乾血癆，亦有效焉。</p>
<h3>燕窩（一）</h3>
<p>— 曹炳章</p>
<p>燕窩爲我國有名之補品，或作珍肴，或供藥用，大抵人皆知之。但其名稱產地形態等寶貴之學理，本草未詳，恐鮮有知之者。愛作斯篇，以吿國人</p>
<p>名稱　係雨燕科中之金絲燕，食海生物所化之唾液，吐出所營造之窩，故名燕窩，有毛者曰毛燕，無毛者日光燕，或日暹遲燕，曰龍牙燕。</p>
<h3>傷寒症之　病情變化及食養程序</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>傷寒之症，人皆知爲由於感受風寒而起，然其最大原因，則由於飲食不愼所致，病從口入腸胃爲其病源之所。故忌口也；營養也；必須按時遵守。若病時猶復妄食，何異自戕其軀。病後恣食，亦可喪命於旦夕。病後食養失調，即易釀成虛癆衰損之症。病後食養得宜，即爲變更體格反弱爲强之機遇。傷塞須講『食養』。其重要可知。</p>
<p>此症患者，以二三十歲之男子居多。往往平日身體康强，忍寒恣食，習爲常事，十餘年不易發熱，積漸旣深，一旦發病，其勢必甚，於是病有一二月，出入於生死之問。</p>
<p>中醫所謂傷寒，範圍較廣，包括五種病候。　受風傷寒。　受寒傷寒。　濕溫傷寒。　溫病。即俗稱溫熱傷寒者是也。在春季曰：春溫或風溫。在秋季曰：秋溫。在冬季曰：冬溫。　暍熱症。即夏季俗稱暑溫傷塞者是也。上述五種傷寒病症，其病情變化，的以一星期爲一候。照理有六期轉變。所謂六經病象。現將六期步驟洋列如次：</p>
<p>七日一候，乃通常狀况。並無刻板規定，亦有第二日即入第二期狀態者，且此症治之得法，一二星期中頗有痊愈希望。傷寒症情即此結束，並非必須演完六期證象，此點不可不知。</p>
<p>（甲）第一時期證象；傷寒初起，發熱爲明顯證象，並覺頭痛項頸牽强。受風者畏風特甚，發熱時汗市亦不解，鼻塞或略有乾噁。受寒者長寒特甚，汗不出，熱勢翕翕然，微喘而咳，遍身骨楚痠痛。此期皆以發熱頭痛爲中要病象。此時宜用發表之法，往往在第一星期中治之即愈</p>
<p>各種溫病初起，第一週蒸蒸發熱，口渴，不甚惡寒，即如下列第二週　狀。濕溫病初起爲精神疲憊，四肢倦怠無力，頭暈時覺况重，飲食不思，胸悶脘悶爲其最大顯著症象，腹部阻塞時覺小小不舒，寒熱蒸蒸然，百法不退，上海方面此症最多。</p>
<p>（乙）第二時期證象；發熱，熱　轉爲蒸蒸然，熱高至百零二三度，汗出熱不退，不畏寒，頭部暈沉，口乾唇燥，渴欲飲水，夜寐夢魅紛紜，目乾鼻乾，大便閉結，小便赤熱，腸胃覺滿塞狀，口苦淡無味，全無飲貧之意，其中病勢較凶者，在此期內，熱度高達百零四五度，煩燥不得安眠，寐則頻作嗨語，所言皆日常瑣事，在日間一言再言，重覆不自知，心中懊憹，面色油膩渾黃。</p>
<p>在此時期，能洩屁而大便者佳。夜語如見鬼狀，尚非凶惡。如兩月直視，喘滿者則危矣，此時川淸熱通大便法，治之得宜，一二劑神志即淸，極易轉危爲安，此爲傷寒症證象最惡時期，表面已極危急，實際尚非　篤。　（未完）</p>
<h3>萄生梨　與喉症</h3>
<p>— 張懷霖</p>
<p>秋末冬初，是喉症最猖獗的季節。從秋天到冬天，氣候逐漸冷下去，居家取煖小得不用火爐之類，最經濟的，也生起一隻煤球爐取煖。同時風的威分又很燥烈，室內乾熱，室外風燥，就是造成喉症的最大原因，喉症之所以常在秋末冬初流行，就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>，是人人愛吃的菜蔬，天然的甜味，烹飪得法，確是一碗美味的佳餚，價錢又不貴。再分析他的成分，營養素很充足。更有化痰潤燥助消化等功用。對於喉症的原因，燥風和乾熱，有相當防制的效力。所以在秋末冬初的季節，多吃蘿蔔是最適宜的。不但可以預防喉症，卽使已經流行着，也可避　傳染。而且已患輕性喉症，吃了蘿蔔也能够防止其蔓延和擴張。</p>
<p>生梨，用不到介紹，誰都知道它是很好喫的水菒，它的功用與蘿蔔大同小異，有過之無不及。味甜適口，有淸潤咽喉之功，兼療咳嗽之疾。</p>
<h3>令補品</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>冬令爲吾人調補身體最適宜之時，惟補品繁多，功效不一，反使進補者，無所適從，究竟何者爲宜。此一問題，殊有研究之價值。茲將國產成藥補品略舉數種於後，並說明其性質及功效以供採用。</p>
<p>阿膠</p>
<p>此膠以黑驢皮和阿井水煎熬而成，有淸肺養肝，滋腎和血之功。故能使血液環行，爲婦女調經養血之妙品，服用時可以陳酒溶化，每决二三錢。和以他藥，煮成膏滋，亦佳。</p>
<p>百補全鹿丸</p>
<p>此丸係用鹿肉與袖藥配合而成性質溫和，功能振精神，健步履，充血液，壯元陽。故老年陽氣虛躬者最爲相宜。惟壯年之人及體氣素熱者。須經醫生指導服之。</p>
<p>鹿角膠</p>
<p>本品係用鹿角熬成之膠，性質甘平無毒，功能溫補肝腎。滋養精血，用作滋補神經衰弱及貧血者，最爲有效。服用時可以水化，或陳酒溶化，或和他藥作爲丸　。膏劑。</p>
<p>龜版膠</p>
<p>此膠用敗龜之底版煎熬而成，滋養之功甚大，老年陰盧火旺者，服之最宜用陳酒燉烊化服，或淸水調和亦可，每晨服二三錢，惟脾虛胃弱者，宜經醫生擇用。</p>
<p>兩儀膏</p>
<p>本品用潞黨參，熟地黃，二味藥品煎熬成膏，功能益精補氣，老幼均宜，且性極和平，而售價又極經濟，爲補品之上者。每服一匙，早晚空腹時用開水冲服即可。</p>

<h3>愈弄愈僵</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>日本此决對華用兵，弄到這樣筋疲力盡，原是意想不到的事。</p>
<p>日本想偷機，不想用兵，用兵原出於不得已，他們本來預料，倘然眞正用兵，兩三個月，亦可畢事。因爲中國沒有現代的武器，卽有亦微之又微，又是一個並非好戰的國家，不假吹灰之力，如囊中物，可唾手而取也。</p>
<p>詎知打了三個月之後，中國抗戰的力量，非但不見消滅，而漸漸增强，於是大倡其三年戰爭。迨南京陷落，戰綫愈弄愈長，勝利的目的，愈無把握，於是大倡其十年戰爭。及武漢陷落，廣東不守，戰區更爲遼闊，而我國抗戰的力量與精神，倍加興奮，日本勝利的把握，愈覺難期，於是大倡其百年戰爭。</p>
<p>由不宣而戰，到如今僅一年又半，而日本主戰的論調，已由三年而至十年，由十年而至百年，倘再抗戰一二年，我想他們必定大倡其千年戰爭，與萬年戰爭了。此種論調，雖是他們的信口吹牛，其實適足見其內容的空虛，與心神的慌張而已。</p>
<p>現在散播種種和平空氣，就足以見他們怯弱的病症，他們旣經主張武力佔領於前，何必散播和平空氣於後，主張和平，主張停戰之時期，業已過去，現在再來打三百合，拚個你死我活再講。</p>
<h3>溜冰狂的重現</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>天冷了，溜冰的季節是展開了，在上海這都市裏面，溜冰在將來一决重現，事實早已給予了我們一個鐵證。</p>
<p>溜冰本來是一種北國的玩藝，不知爲什麼，竟和成了「孤島」後的上海，發生起好感來，就在砲火中傳到了南方。溜冰和游泳是相反的，是交替的，當游泳正熱鬧非凡的夏季，溜冰塲是消聲而匿跡，但而今吧，游泳池裏鴉雀無聲，溜冰塲却開始熱鬧起來了。</p>
<p>在我們的記憶上，上海的溜冰固不自今日始，十多年前，新世界就闢有跑冰塲。後來其他的遊戲塲和南市的半淞園，也有跑冰塲的設置。祇是那時的溜冰塲裏，每天有着幾個輕浮的女人在溜冰，而那些男人去溜冰吧，醉翁之意不在酒，也是受了這些女人的吸引，正和跑驢塲有同似之處。溜冰的技術也簡單得很，祇是兜圈子，溜冰鞋也是比較普通而粗笨的一種。</p>
<p>在北國，到了冬天，溜冰是準會相當的在熱。各大學的學生，更會舉行化裝溜冰大會的玩意。可是上海吧，連河也不大見，就是大冷天，河裏的冰結得不大厚，不能溜冰，所以上海人的溜冰，也祇是溜水門汀和溜地板而已。以前的溜冰，祗見於遊戲塲中，可是三偭半月滬戰吿終，上海人對於溜冰却突然的在熱起來，像是受了什麼刺激，整個的春天是陷在溜冰的狂熱之中。</p>
<p>爲了溜冰的突見在熱，好多溜冰塲便在上海陸續的出現了。除了特設的溜冰塲之外，有若干舞塲，更另關一部，專作溜冰之用，在一個很短的時期之中，造成了許多溜冰的人才。星期六，星期日。摩登女子，時裝少年，相偕上溜冰塲去大顯身手。每小時二角，乃至六角，去玩一天也要化不少錢。溜冰鞋是比以前特別考究，全是來路貨，每雙至少要五六元，甚至一二十元以外。溜冰的技術也進步了，什麼倒走哩，打　哩，單足哩，盤坐哩……。更有幾家溜冰塲，舉行過化裝溜冰大會，溜冰競賽大會，溜冰籃球比賽等玩意，號召溜客和看客。</p>
<p>男人對於溜冰是這樣在熱，姑娘們也不甘雌伏，有好多已練就了溜冰的特技。甚至靑年學生和孩子們，也醉心於溜冰上面，學校裏的操塲上或校門前的馬路上，祗要一散課，就有學生在溜冰；每一條弄堂裏，特別是禮拜天，會有許多孩子，大人，在習練溜冰。等到學會了，就上溜冰塲去一顯本領，溜冰鞋，買不起嗎，有人家出租。孩子們積下的零用錢，凑滿了五六元，便去買溜冰鞋，爸爸會對兒子說：「你今年考得成續好，我買一雙溜冰鞋給你，作爲獎勵」。</p>
<p>整個的都市，在溜冰的氣氛之中，結果使許多開設溜冰塲的老闆賺了好多錢，而舶來品的溜冰鞋，更有驚人的銷數。大公司裏，特關一個橱窗，陳列着各式溜冰鞋，男用，女用，孩子用，什麼都有，這幾天，朔風凛冽，天氣嚴寒，每一條馬路，每一個弄堂，又到處有人在習練溜冰了。所有的溜冰塲，整個游泳季中關着門，而今又在忙着佈置，籌備開張，有的更老早在營業了。—一切的一切，事實吿訴我們，在孤島一上，溜冰這玩藝，叉將來一决在熱，直要到春盡夏初，游泳季展開了才會歛跡呢</p>

<h3>丹桂飄香</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>雷電華出品　大上海大戲院映</p>
<p>「丹桂飄香」，這譯名是够「風流」的，那末，你當然想知道它的「內容」如何。這裏，我就暫充一個「故事講述者」——外國好像也有這一行職業，呌做Story　Teller。</p>
<p>「有少年比爾，喜　魚，想到南海去研究漁業。本片的開始，就介紹比爾出塲，而且一輛魚車，被汽車撞翻了，也因之介紹少女希拉給比爾見面。</p>
<p>「但是，比爾的父親（牛奶廠主人），頗不以比爾之志爲然。乃與比爾的，令暫充送牛奶之夫役，爲期三十日，設成續優越，則元比爾赴南海研究漁業。</p>
<p>「於是，此爾穿上了白制服，實行「富公子送乳求佳麗」的開始了。</p>
<p>「一日，比爾的希拉赴跳舞會，希拉允之。但其母堅欲其伴統袴子華萊赴宴，乃拒比爾之請。是夜，不期過於跳舞會中，比責女失的，女見比爾亦另偕女伴而來，亦復反唇相譏，致不歡而散。</p>
<p>「比爾以開罪於女，夤夜叩女門求見，而且仿「羅密歐與朱的叶」的故事，比爾擬架梯越窗而入。華萊却打電話吿警，於是「羅密歐」被警士捉去。</p>
<p>「斯時也，比爾之工作，尚餘一日，希拉乃代比爾駕車送乳。</p>
<p>「女母發覺希拉失踪，卽報捕稱爲匪所綁。</p>
<p>「適比爾釋放，遇女於途。這是本片的最高潮，警探及女母等的車子，都追踪着送乳車，希拉並用牛乳瓶向後投去，追踪的車子都被滑到斜路上去</p>
<p>「他們趕回牛奶廠，剛是報到的最後一秒鐘。我聽到隔座一位小姐喊了聲「噢唷！」眞是太險了」</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓</p>
<p>那何氏父女，一到了上海，就不免有許多酬應了。雖然現代中國，國民都是極端的提倡節的，一切奢靡之習，全要掃除。但上海那個地方，叉當別論，因爲那是全世界僑商，薈萃在這裏的，物質程度，也超越尋常。何先生那時自有一班商業界，運輸界，金融界，以及其他各界，招請宴會，幾無虛日。這裏面，不但是本國人，允其是歐美各國的商人爲多數。何小姐也有她們的舊同學，小姊妹等等，而且近來的宴會，男女並請，全不似從前只請男客，不請內眷的。因此謂了何先生的，也必定把他兩位女公子一同請來。允其是兩位小姐是個雙咆胎，生得父是一個樣兒，大家動於好奇心，也要請他們來瞻仰瞻仰。不過這種宴會，偶然來個一决兩决，還不妨礙，若是常鬧下去，便要覺得厭煩了。現在何先生到了上海，眞個是排日爲宴，今天是英國僑商總會，明天是法國總領事館，後天是美國駐滬運輸公司，再後天又是蘇聯茶葉貿易會。凡是請帖上有了何先生的，必然也有何小姐。對於其餘的來賓，也是男女賓同請的。自然正當的宴會，都是晚餐，後來晚餐擠不開了，改爲午餐，甚而午餐也擠不開，有改爲茶話會的，允其是外國人請客，倘然兩位小姐不去，好像有些失禮，却使人不高興。這幾天，眞個使人覺得鬧乏了。有一天，伺先生和他兩位小姐說道：「如此酬酢，眞是受罪了。我們須得淸凈幾天纔好。好在我今天得到了電報，就要到北平，天津去。北平，天津的事，辦妥當了，還要到東北去一趟。你們此來，不是說要去看你的要好同學朱愛人嗎？那末我到北方去的時候，你們就去看你們的同學吧？再有一件事。。現在我的職務，也許要常在這裏，也論不定。不過上海那個地方，太繁華，太嘈雜了，我不願常住在上海。最好離上海不甚相遠，而空氣淸新，環境良好的地方，我們去找一個住所。有了相當的地址，我們或者去造一座小小的別墅，也無不可。不過交通却是要便利一點的。你此去到你同學那邊，也隨時留意好了。」　（一一）</p>

<p>二十六年冬，方卡爾登改組，信芳挾伯綏嘯潿以捲土重來也，適當南京路游行之變，劍拔弩張，形勢炭及岌，靜安寺路中段，阻隔交通，鐵絲網曾一度壅戲院門首，雖仍有熱心訂座者，掠刀光，排木架，奮不顧身，入院購券，而翌日情勢如何，能吾如期開鑼，實無把握。是夕本訂集前後檯同人於五福樓，歡宴開檯之酒，而鐘嗚八下，到者寥寥，嘯瀾　聰，　裏足不至，一座無歡，意興蕭索，幸翌日形勢巳趨和緩，始獲照常開鑼，特成續實至平淡，十日後漸見起色。逮夫封箱之夕，愚邀春航客串花田錯，海報甫出，坐券預訂一空，鬢影釵光，極一時之盛，益以信芳反串下基，改扮女裝，四坐笑聲，震撼屋瓦，於皆大歡喜之中，繡幕徐落，要爲始料所不及，而越歲之漸臻康泰，於此實肇其機。</p>

<h3>一個被掘發的新人　「孟姜女」主角蔡瑾</h3>
<p>由舞臺演員一躍而為銀幕明星</p>
<p>自從電影從業員紛紛奔往內地以後，「孤島」上的電影事業，在表面上似乎遇到了演員缺少的困離，然而從另一方面看來，則顯然是給予滯留於陳舊的中國電影事業來了個新的轉向，這轉向，便是打破了各公司不敢引用新人的陋習。</p>
<p>在明星制度之下，無名英雄的隊伍中時常會有不少極有天扌的演員不幸地被埋藏着，　不到一顯身手的機會。在過去，銀幕上看來看去祗是幾個老演員在硬撑着塲面。可是，說不定也許正因了道理由會引起觀衆們的厭倦而對電影事業消褪了它們的信仰。假使把道種情形來和層出不窮羅掘新人的好萊塢相對照，那扌多够悲慘！可是，現在雖然我們還是不敢相信那是電影商人們已經有了覺悟轉移目光而有意提拔新人，但是，新人畢竟有了現身的機會了。</p>
<p>這就要說到明星的新人蔡瑾。</p>
<p>「風流寃魂」是她的處女作，她飾路明的妹妹允蘭，演技相當熟鍊活潑，雖則這影片的內容不能引起我們同情，但她個人演劇的親切逼眞，則不能不使我們感到是銀幕上一個很有前途的新人。</p>
<p>她是湖北人，從小生長在北平，家庭環境很不壞，起初，她到南京滙文女中讀書，對於戲劇非常愛好，後來轉入上海美　之後，她就學習昔樂。她的原名蔡蘊玉，那時便參加業餘劇團開始演劇，但她首决的被人發現，還在二十五年「業餘劇人協會」公演「大雷雨」的時候。因此「業餘實騐劇團」的成立，應雲衛就特意邀她參加。八一三後，「靑鳥」成立，她扌以蔡瑾的名字再度跨上舞台，「日出」中的小東西和「大雷雨一中的瓦爾哇拉這兩個角色，便是她得到戲劇界一致好評的演出。從此，她就漸漸爲人所注意，成功了舞台上新進的人扌。道一次「明星」的復活，在國華處女片「風流寃魂」中，蔡瑾被羅致爲路明的搭配，由於她演技的認眞努力，這良好的收穫，便使她在第二部一「孟姜女」之中，竟被躍而和周璇等並立爲主角之一了。</p>
<h3>舞蹈的欣賞（下）</h3>
<p>— 家聲</p>
<p>七，劇舞</p>
<p>「劇舞一是種戲劇形式的舞，在題材上與「叙事舞」都是描寫整個故事，不過在結構中揷入對話與不舞的動作，但以「舞爲整個組織的輪廓，所以，對這種舞的欣實，不要當作劇，仍須把牠看做是種舞蹈，可是也應該含有戲劇的吠賞的成分的。</p>
<p>八，啞劇</p>
<p>「啞劇一的動作雖然是戲劇的姿態，但牠是從舞蹈起源來的。即是現代的啞劇，還含有不少的舞蹈錢條，所以，從啞劇中也可見到舞蹈的成分，而且對這種舞蹈的領略，須特別注意舞者之面部表悄。</p>
<p>九，歌舞</p>
<p>「歌舞」這名詞，近來在中國似乎很晋過，但這裏所要說的，並不是目前中國所流行的那些歌舞，而是種藝術的歌舞。</p>
<p>「歌舞」是歌與舞相提並重的綜台藝術，用歌烘托舞的背景，那是最能發揮其効果的。同樣的，用舞的姿態發揮歌的悄調，那也能加强其表現的。樣的，用舞的姿態發揮歌的情調，那也能加强　，似乎更進了一步。</p>
<p>十，歌舞劇</p>
<p>一般人把「歌舞」與「歌舞劇」弄成是一種東西，那錯了。歌舞」只是「歌」與「舞」的結合，「歌舞劇」，是「歌舞」加上「劇」的組織，所謂歌舞形式的戲劇，歌舞是一個主題的描寫，歌舞劇是一個故事的描寫。賞鑑者當注意兩者的區別。</p>
<p>還有不可把「歌舞劇」認成「歌劇」雖然道兩者都是有劇的組織，但形式與動作上司不同。「歌劇」的動作雖然是起源於舞蹈，但牠目成爲歌劇以後，就含有充分的話戲姿態了·「歌舞劇一的動作純粹是舞蹈姿態，同時，歌劇的旋律與歌舞劇的旋律，在節奏與動幾（Motfbe）上完全兩樣。「歌舞劇」的旋律是相應於舞蹈節奏的純歌曲形式，式，可是，歌劇」的旋律是</p>
<p>我們欣賞舞蹈藝術，應特別注意到他們的本質　形式的分別。</p>

<p>琴逑羅傑絲小姐在她住宅的屋頂上裝置一個電視的機件。在晴天之下，可以從機件中看到米高梅攝影塲裏面的現狀。這是多麼新式的科學玩兿呢。</p>
<p>這」　有幾條銀星的小新聞，是可以使影迷們感到興趣的。女星瓊賓拉的私有游泳池底是玻璃砌成的，泰山男主角瓊尼韋斯摩拉在攝聲時未曾說錯一句對白，他現在的年薪是四萬元。嘉寶小姐更厲害了，她不曾在攝影塲外說錯一句話，每年的薪水是四十萬元。卡羅朗白每月初一便簽好一張一千五百元的支票，供給她的父母爲生活費，賈克與開道個頑皮明星，他本來是一個聲名浪藉的醉漢。可以現在他却涓滴不入口，每天至多喝喝汽水呢</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒最近接見五位小貴客，便是「五福臨門」孿生的五位小姑娘。這不能不說是影電史上的的大事了。茲錄其對話如：</p>
<p>秀　問：「哈　，女孩們，你們一切都好嗎？」</p>
<p>五女之中二女代表回答說</p>
<p>「一切都好，我們並沒有什麼不滿意的事。秀蘭姐，我們在銀行裏已有五十萬元的存款了，而且我們跟甘世紀公司還訂好拍戲合各呢。」</p>
<p>秀蘭說：「這種很不錯，等到你們有我這麼大的年紀時，你們就曉得這些錢對你們有什麼用途了。」</p>
<p>誰想到一個落落大方的女明星也有這麼狼狽的一天。她是鼎鼎大名的瓊克勞馥，她一個人乘着自備汽車經過一家影戲院，忽然想看那一部片子。她便停車欲入，可是她的愛犬「浦進」却大呌大鬧，硬要跟她進去，不肯被鎖在汽車中受悶。大槪他也有觀影的癖性吧！因此瓊小姐便問看門人商量，終以格於定例不准携狗入院。瓊小姐便和經理先生商量。說「浦進」很馴服，决不做聲的。經理爲了討好大明星總算特別通融了，誰想到瓊小姐的丈夫弗蘭却東在該片中佔着要角地位，「浦進」見主入出現於銀慕時突然在吠起來。弄得瓊克勞馥連忙拖犬出奔呢。</p>
<p>最近影壇上有一部新片出世，題名是「墨索里尼私生活。」該片把這位意大利首相的家庭生活，辦公形態，日常　定，都很忠實地記錄起來。我想無論對「法西斯主義」有無好感的人，都會樂意看一看這部記錄片的。是片由美商好令逑製片廠攝製。恐怕本片很難好在上海公映吧！</p>
<p>泰山的結髮眞妻熱女郞呂凡麗也是一位女明星，可是久不得志於銀幕了，據說她找到一個紐的富豪做靠山，另外打開一條出路。據那位富豪說：他將不惜耗費金錢，使呂小姐得到前所未有的表演機會。比一泰山「做過的機食更加來得好，我們等着瞧吧！</p>
<p>糟糕糟糕，瓊克勞馥和弗蘭却通這對新婚不久的夫妻也不和了。他倆雖然還沒有鬧離婚，可是已經分開活動。每天彼此各走各路，再也看不到他倆甜甜蜜蜜地在一起玩了。而且在社交塲中彼此各帶着異性朋友同遊，夫妻間要發請帖扌有一天一同吃飯，眞是相敬如賓，越來越疏遠了。大槪不久非要鬧成悲劇是不會終止的。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Has Recaptured Shilong; A Large Number of Planes Display Power in the Pearl River, Sinking Two Japanese Warships; 500 Foreign Pilots Arrive in the Mainland to Participate in the War</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) After fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies, the Chinese army recaptured Shilong yesterday. Chinese guerrillas have also reached outside the east and west gates of Dongguan. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news: The Chinese Air Force recently flew over Shilong and Dongguan to distribute leaflets, advising the people to quickly evacuate outside the city, because the Chinese army is about to launch a counterattack on the two places. In addition, 17 Chinese bombers flew over the Pearl River and bombed Japanese warships anchored at Bai'e. Two ships were hit and destroyed, sinking. The Japanese army, which was repelled by the Chinese army in Zengcheng, is now concentrated in Shilong, Dongguan, Shitan, and other places along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. It is speculated that the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the Dong River is due to the Japanese army from Sanshui and Southwest along the West River, which invaded Guangxi from the west, having reinforced the area. In the Beihai area, four Japanese warships are docked, planning to use Guangzhou Bay as a base for military operations. It is rumored that Japan will start to make moves in the Beihai area next week. The Chinese army has strengthened its defenses along the coast to prepare for the Japanese. (Special dispatch at 12:00 PM on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Western newspapers report that a new and powerful Chinese Air Force will be formed soon and will go into action. The Chinese military authorities have decided to accept foreign pilots into the Air Force to fight against Japan. Currently, 500 foreign pilots have secretly come to China and have arrived in the mainland. Among them, 300 are of Soviet Russian nationality, and the rest are mostly British and French. In addition, there are many people of American, Canadian, Austrian, and New Zealand nationalities. Two New Zealand pilots recently came to Hong Kong from the Spanish battlefield and are transiting to Chongqing. It is reported that the Chinese side has also dispatched Gu and Guo to Paris and London to recruit these volunteer pilots. (Special dispatch at 8:00 PM on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources from foreigners, the Chinese Air Force bombed Japanese positions in the Shilong and Dongguan areas on the 10th of this month and engaged in fierce air battles with Japanese aircraft. After completing their missions, the Chinese aircraft safely returned to their bases. (Fast News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(New York) Today, according to a report from the New York Times, the Chinese government has signed a trial contract with the Blanc Aviation Company to purchase 200 aircraft, with a total value of US$8.5 million. Each aircraft will have the capacity to carry seven large bombs. The contract stipulates delivery within three months, but it has not yet been formally approved. (Reuters Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) General Bai Chongxi, commander-in-chief of the Southwest Headquarters, recently convened a meeting of Southwest military leaders in Guilin. It is reported that the meeting discussed strengthening Southwest defense fortifications, and a plan for a full-scale counterattack to recover Guangzhou has also been decided. It is expected that the military affairs in South China, under the leadership of Generals Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, and Li Hanhun, will achieve excellent results. (Fast News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to sources here, there were no major changes in the battles on various fronts in Guangdong Province yesterday. The Japanese army in the northwest and two rivers has been increasing in recent days. The Japanese army is transporting supplies very frequently on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line, and it seems that they intend to invade the west again. Beihai has been continuously bombed by Japanese aircraft in recent days, suffering heavy losses. Japanese warships outside the port of Beihai have shelled Guantou Mountain (transliteration) near Beihai twice and attempted to send troops to land, but were repelled by the Chinese army. (Fast News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the battle in the Dong River has become quiet since yesterday. There are fierce battles near Conghua in the North River. The Japanese army in the West River attacked Jinli fiercely again yesterday, but was repelled by the Chinese army. (Fast News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare Will Be Launched in Various Provinces of North China; Reorganization of Original Troops into Guerrilla Units Has Been Completed; Shi Yousan's Troops Enter Chahar; Sun Dianying Promoted to Army Commander; Remnants of Japanese Army in Western Shanxi Are Being Swept Away</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Luoyang Dispatch: After the Chinese side in the North China guerrilla area has increased its strength, its strength has been strengthened. The original troops have been reorganized into guerrilla units, and the adjustments have been completed. A certain commander recently led his troops to station in a certain place, and the troops under his command have all arrived at the appropriate locations. Shi Yousan's troops have entered the Chahar border and will assume the position of chairman. Sun Dianying has been promoted to army commander of a certain army. Large-scale guerrilla warfare is about to be launched. Remnants of the Japanese army in western Shanxi are being swept away. (Special dispatch at 8:00 PM on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Chinese army recently declared to reporters that the battle in western Shanxi is still in full swing. Judging from the actions of the Japanese army in the past two weeks, the Japanese army does have the intention of invading the northwest. In the past ten days, the Japanese army in Shanxi Province has launched a full-scale attack on western Shanxi, with the aim of "clearing" the main force of the Chinese army in western Shanxi, and then crossing the river to invade Shaanxi Province. However, this attempt has been foiled by the Chinese army. Due to strategic considerations, the Chinese army in western Shanxi once abandoned Jixian, Daning, Puxian, Xiangning, and other places. After reinforcements arrived on the 6th of this month, the Chinese army launched a large-scale counterattack. After three days and nights of arduous fighting, it finally recovered all the lost territories one after another. (Fast News Agency Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese people here believe that the news of the victory of the Chinese army in western Shanxi, which was published in various newspapers this morning, is extremely important. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army on the Datong-Puzhou Railway moved westward in five directions last month, attempting to occupy Jixian, west of Linfen in southwestern Shanxi Province, where the headquarters of the Chinese army in Shanxi Province is located. However, the Chinese army immediately withdrew from the area and simultaneously dispatched strong troops to enter the Lüliang Mountains and occupied the key point of Heilongguan in the rear of the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese army stationed west of the mountain was forced to retreat south to Hejin. The Xinhua Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, criticized the news of the victory of the Chinese army, saying, "The victory in Shanxi Province not only eliminates the Japanese army's attempt to invade the northwest, but also affects the activities of the Japanese army in central and southern China.

<h3>China Has Sufficient Financial Resources During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing said that China's international status is becoming increasingly solid, and friendly countries have voluntarily contacted us, willing to lend us huge sums of money. Since we have no urgent use for them, we have politely declined them all. A certain friendly country recently offered to lend us tens of millions of pounds, but we have not accepted it either. Although the War of Resistance has reached this point, we do not lack money to use. Borrowing more debt would be a waste, so it is better not to borrow it. English credit loans to purchase cars have been shipped to China. (Special dispatch at 5:00 PM on the 12th)</p>

At the same time, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were discovered near Nanzha. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, more than 60 Japanese soldiers were killed. In this battle, the Chinese side suffered 14 casualties. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled towards Shuanglin. Wuzhen is still in Chinese hands. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>On the night of the 7th, the 20+ Japanese soldiers stationed at Tongcheng Shuzi Port were surrounded and suppressed by the Li unit of the Chinese guerrilla team, killing a total of seven Japanese soldiers and seizing seven rifles.

In this battle, the Chinese army also seized two warhorses and a total of three light and heavy machine guns. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Discusses the Situation of the Past Week</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Recently, enemy warships have continued to gather in the East China Sea, and it seems that they intend to invade Jiangmen and Siyi again. We are closely guarding against this. The situation in northern Hunan and southern Hubei is very quiet. Since our army attacked Taolin Fengjiacun on December 27, killing dozens of enemies, the enemy has been very panicked. In recent days, the enemy has been very busy mobilizing in the area west of Taolin, and they have also built a highway from west to Qijiaqiao, which has now been completed. More than 100 enemies in Shanglongwan are stationed with barbed wire densely deployed around the area, and more than 300 civilians have been brutally killed. The people are now fleeing one after another. On the 4th, our army destroyed three enemy vehicles near Kangwangqiao, east of Xinkaitang, killing more than a dozen enemies, and seizing three rifles and many other military supplies. Another unit ambushed near Jiangshanping, west of Xinkaitang, killing more than 20 enemies and capturing four warhorses. The enemy in Yueyang is preparing to retreat eastward, and the enemy warships on the river surface have also all retreated to Bailuoji. Currently, Yueyang is just an empty city, and our guerrilla team is advancing towards Yueyang. Henan is also very quiet. Our guerrilla units annihilated many Japanese soldiers in the Xianning and Chongyang areas on the 1st, and captured three Japanese soldiers, including a part of Sato, and countless other military supplies.</p>
<p>Northern Henan and Eastern Hubei: In northwestern Hubei, there have only been minor skirmishes. The Japanese army in Tianmen, Jingshan, Zaoshi, and Yangjiachang has mostly withdrawn from Yangjiachang. The Chinese army followed up and has advanced to Chengling, not far from Hanchuan City, and is still advancing. The Japanese army in Suixian and Luoyangdian engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the 27th of last week. After being repelled, the Japanese army on the west bank of Jiangjiahe near Xihe moved again. On the 2nd, they used artillery to start a full-scale test firing at the Chinese army's position, and then launched a fierce attack on us with more than 200 infantrymen under their artillery fire, but they were still repelled, killing more than a dozen enemies. The enemy in Ying shan Yanqidian increased by several hundred. Their political team went to Haojiadian to incite the people and was driven away. In the northeast, on the morning of the 3rd, four to five hundred enemy infantry and cavalrymen, with two infantry guns, launched a fierce attack on our Macheng North Yanjiahe guerrilla unit. After a two-hour standoff, we retreated to Yewan, suffering slight casualties. The enemy occupied Yanjiahe and is still constantly attacking us. The enemy in Dashushan has recently increased, and it seems that they intend to attack Lu'an. We are ready to give them a head-on blow.</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi and Central Anhui: The enemy in northern Anhui, Yongxiu, and Dean was attacked by us in different directions on New Year's Day, and we achieved considerable gains. Baicha was once recovered by us, and we seized many steel helmets and other military supplies. The enemy north of Zhanggongdu shelled us on the 4th and released poison gas. More than a dozen of our defending soldiers were poisoned and killed or injured. Our guerrilla units attacked the enemy on the Jiuxing Highway on the night of the 4th. The enemy responded in a panic and was eventually killed by us by hundreds, and we seized more than a dozen rifles, two light machine guns, and many military supplies such as binoculars and bicycles. On the afternoon of the 1st, more than 200 enemy infantry and cavalrymen in Wanzhi, southern Anhui, occupied Honghuapu and were soon repelled by our guerrilla team. More than 300 enemies attacked us on Guolong Mountain and were also repelled by our defending soldiers. Therefore, in recent days, the situation has been very quiet. The enemy in central and northern Anhui has been mobilizing frequently recently, and we are closely monitoring them.</p>
<p>Henan Province: More than 100 enemy cavalrymen were discovered in Donghuanglou, northwest of Huaiyang, southern Henan, on the afternoon of the 5th. Our army surrounded and attacked them, and they retreated towards Liulin. We are now pursuing them. Enemy cavalry scouts on the Jitai Highway are frequent. More than 200 enemies and six tanks stationed in Shiwangdian, north of Huaiyang, seem to be spying on Xuwan. When Chen Liu's second breach fell, the local anti-Japanese self-defense group surrendered to the Japanese, but the Japanese army confiscated their weapons and used machine guns to shoot and kill more than 600 able-bodied men. Those who are not firm in patriotism can take this as a warning.</p>
<p>Northern Henan: On the evenings of the 1st and 2nd, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Fengxianglongpan, southeast of Qinyang, and achieved slight gains. At the same time, a certain A battalion attacked Chongyi Town, west of Qinyang, and engaged in a battle with the Japanese army in Dazhen Village for several hours. The enemy suffered more than 30 casualties, and we lost a platoon leader and three soldiers. In addition, Battalion B, with several mortars, attacked Longpan again and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy who had been ambushed outside the village for four hours, destroying two enemy guns. The enemy in eastern Henan has been mobilizing recently, and it seems that they intend to invade the west. The situation in northern Shanxi and western Shanxi is extremely tense. 30,000 enemy troops in southern Shanxi, in view of the failure of the previous attack on Zhongtiao Mountain, have recently adopted a defensive posture in the Yongji Jiexian Anyi area. Another force has aided Hejin and attacked Xiangning, Jixian, Daning, and Yonghe in western Shanxi, attempting to break through the base of our Jin Sui army, and then advance north to threaten the North Yumen and realize their dream of invading Shaanxi. However, after our defending army attacked them separately, the enemy suffered heavy losses. They are still in a state of chaos. In the second half of December, more than 3,000 enemies from Shanxi Linfen and Hejin attacked various counties. On the 31st, they captured Jixian. More than 1,000 enemies who entered Jixian divided into three routes on the 1st and invaded west, one towards Mafenyang, one towards Longwangshan, and one towards Xiaochuanwo. Our troops stationed on both sides are intercepting them. In addition, the enemy on Longwang Mountain in Jixian has increased to more than 1,000, and the enemy has reached six or seven hundred in Xiaochuanwo, and the artillery battle with our troops in the west of the river is quite fierce. A part of the enemy, several hundred people, in Daning went south early in the morning of the 3rd and engaged in a fierce battle with our army in the area of ​​Dahui Palace. The enemy on the Zhongli Highway was attacked by us on the night of the 30th of last month. The enemy suffered more than 200 casualties and destroyed nine bunkers and three small guns. Then a part of them scrambled to intercept Zhongqiqiqi from Shuitou. The Chinese army Qianqian launched a general offensive and won a great victory, and Jixian Danning Xiangpu counties were successively captured, and are now chasing the Japanese army. There has been no fighting in Suiyuan. The Japanese army is building an airfield in Baotou Lafu very urgently. Recently, the troops have been mobilized, and the situation is very tense, but it is only a trick to show strength. In other aspects, more than 20 giant Japanese warships recently arrived at Hui'an Xiutu Port in Fujian. On the morning of the 3rd, they fired 70+ rounds to cover the Japanese soldiers in an attempt to land, but they were repelled by the Chinese defending soldiers. The Chinese guerrilla team on the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway has been very active recently. The guerrilla team has captured Liyang County and is now attacking Jurong Nanjing and other places. The Japanese army's attempt to wipe out the Chinese guerrilla team has failed again. The Japanese army in Suqian Shaobo in northern Jiangsu has been quite restless recently, and the Chinese army is preparing to meet them. The Japanese army in Lianyungang has repeatedly attacked Sunjiashan, but has been repelled by the Chinese defending soldiers, and they are still in a stalemate near Sunjiashan. Chinese forces have recently launched attacks in Nanlinyi and Juye, achieving significant gains. Eight hundred puppet troops in Juye are fighting against the garrison troops in Dancheng. There has been only minor contact with the guerrilla team in Hebei, and there have been no changes. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Please Respond to Difficulties with Reason</h3>
<p>Regarding the necessity and trend of the joint Anglo-American economic retaliation action against Japan; British and American great politicians should mobilize the people to see its success; this newspaper has already analyzed it yesterday. Subsequently, according to foreign electricity, Britain and the United States still have their own difficulties in implementing retaliation. For example, the American capital electric report of the Havas News Agency stated that many members of the US Congress advocate adopting economic sanctions against Japan; Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Democratic Senator Pittman, also made a wonderful analogy, saying: "If someone can be forced to respect your rights by means of starvation, why must you definitely execute him?" However, there are opponents, such as Republican Senator Borah, who said: "Economic sanctions are by no means peaceful measures, but a preliminary method of war. If I am not prepared to fight, I am unwilling to implement sanctions." It is still difficult to see in advance how to choose between the two factions. This is the difficulty of implementing the Japanese restriction, first. Another example is the electric report of Reuters in Yingjing, saying that part of the difficulty encountered by the British government in commercial retaliation is the opposition of the self-governing regions that operate Japanese trade in the hardware industry and the wool industry. It is heard that Washington is also hindered by the oil, cotton, scrap iron, and machinery industries. British and American great merchants, with long sleeves and good dancing, often have the possibility of giving their national policies a certain influence on the attitude of national affairs. This is the difficulty of implementing sanctions, another.</p>
<p>All these so-called difficulties have long been understood by knowledgeable people; the damage to the rights of the British and American countries in China caused by Japan, and the trampling on the territorial sovereignty and people of China, actually began at the same time as the 918 Incident seven years ago, and not just recently. Those who have brewed retaliation only after a long period of time: First, the ambition of Japan to monopolize and dominate was not clearly understood by the countries at the beginning, thinking that the gains and losses were only between fat and lean, and would not be rejected to the point of being exhausted. Second, the persistence and determination of China's war of resistance were not clearly understood by the countries at the beginning, thinking that the northeast was a fool, and that it would be handed over with both hands. Seeing that the heavy troops are coming, the alliance is under the city, even if they all die together, they can only sigh. Third, they believed in the effectiveness of diplomacy, thinking that Japan would not be absolutely rude and unreasonable in the collision, and that a slightly stronger protest could kill the ferocity. Fourth, they were afraid of being involved in the military whirlpool in the Far East, and were lonely and self-sufficient. Fifth, Japan's capital structure was quite mature, and it coincided with the period of world economic panic. The industrial and commercial circles of various countries who operated Japanese trade cherished this Far East patron even more. Sixth, democratic countries have an innate inertia in their policies, so it is not easy to change old policies and create new ones. Seventh, the countries have failed to be open and honest, and each has guarded against fraud. If there are those who use the opportunity to capture and release friends and enemies, the plan will not succeed, but will suffer. Eighth, the international alliance and the naval agreement, as well as the disarmament movement, are all majestic and "harmonious". These eight points are quite contradictory and exist together; therefore, although the rights in China have been damaged, there is unwillingness, fear, or unnecessary, or impossible to do, or not to do before China is defeated and surrenders.</p>
<p>Until recently, the facts have gradually become powerful eloquence: if Japan brazenly creates the so-called new order and attempts to close the entire Chinese door in order to fulfill its ambition of monopolizing and dominating; if China's war of resistance has lasted for more than eighteen months and can continue to exert its great tenacity, striving for the final victory; if the repeated protests of the countries have only been met with contempt, ridicule, deception, and emptiness as a response; if Japan no longer becomes a good patron of the world market due to controlled trade and cash exhaustion; if the international community becomes accustomed to aggression and competes for military expansion in an atmosphere of killing on the earth; this is a fact that is written. Therefore, the brewing of retaliation and sanctions should be developed in response to the trend. However, there are still difficulties, such as those transmitted by the two agencies Havas and Reuters mentioned above, which are either obscured by emotions or limited by immediate interests, and even fail to think deeply. Those in the British and American industrial and commercial circles who are limited by immediate interests should be given rational instructions by the farsighted majority in the British and American countries, and we will not say much. However, we want to further explain to Borah and those who hold similar views as Borah. The initiation of the original economic sanctions is due to the demand to protect the legitimate rights of the country; if the saying that "economic sanctions are by no means peaceful measures, but a preliminary method of war" is filled, it should be inferred that "if I am not prepared to fight, I am unwilling to implement sanctions, and would rather give up the legitimate rights of the country;" Borah is a respected politician in the United States, how can he tolerate hinting that he is willing to give up the legitimate rights of the country? Otherwise, he should propose active, feasible, and effective methods to protect the legitimate rights of the country in addition to economic sanctions! Moreover, economic sanctions and war are not a necessary procedure, and there is no necessary cause and effect. In the Abyssinian issue, under the leadership of Britain, several countries implemented economic sanctions against Italy. Whether it was effective or not is another question, but it was indeed implemented; Britain and Italy not only did not go to war because of this, but British Prime Minister Chamberlain is now a guest in the Italian capital and is warmly welcomed by the Italian government and people; therefore, the saying that sanctions are the preliminary stage of war is theoretically untenable! Even in terms of war, it is said that Japan's invasion of China will be unsustainable, is it said that it will attack the United States remotely? Therefore, the saying that sanctions are the preliminary stage of war is also inevitably impossible in fact! With Japan's arrogance, it has not yet dared to threaten empty words, saying that it will respond to sanctions with war, is Borah not like a Japanese spokesperson? It is known that Borah's remarks only need to be analyzed rationally to know that there is absolutely no place for it, and it is said that there is difficulty in implementing sanctions here, then there must be a way to get rid of it.</p>

<h3>Northwest Salt Tax Revenue Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou) Since the Northwest Salt Affairs were transferred to the Ministry of Finance in the 24th year [of the Republic, 1935], tax revenue has increased year by year, exceeding 1.5 million yuan by the 26th year [1937]. Last year, the entire area was reorganized and the crackdown on smuggling resulted in a sharp increase in tax revenue, reaching 2.3 million yuan. Since the official transportation started last winter, supplying Shaanxi and Henan, over 200,000 dan of Northwest salt have been transported out, and the tax revenue collected is not included. If unified sales are included, it can often exceed 3 million yuan. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Still Blockading the French Concession in Hankou</h3>
<p>The French Consul in Hankou refused to hand over ten Chinese demanded by the Japanese, causing a dispute with the Japanese military authorities. Yesterday, Japanese soldiers were granted permission by the French Consul to enter the French Concession to search with French police for individuals whom the Japanese considered to be involved in anti-Japanese activities and who were hiding in the Concession. A total of twenty-seven Chinese were arrested, of whom seventeen were later released. The remaining ten were detained in the French Concession police station. The Japanese demanded their extradition. The French side insisted that the Japanese provide evidence of their crimes before complying with the request. As of this afternoon, the Japanese authorities had still not been able to provide evidence of the crimes of the ten suspects detained in the French Concession police station, but promised to do so tomorrow. The French Concession police authorities have released two of the ten detainees. This morning, the requirement for Chinese to have passes to enter and exit the French Concession was lifted, so thousands of Chinese entered and exited the Concession in groups, making it impossible for the Japanese sentries responsible for prohibiting free entry and exit to effectively verify whether the Chinese entering and exiting were carrying Japanese passes. Currently, the Japanese are still prohibiting free passage, citing the French Concession's protection of various anti-Japanese elements. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Still Has No Intention of Opening the Yangtze River Shipping</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a Navy Ministry spokesman, commenting on the news of the British ship "Kinshan" sailing from Guangdong, stated that this was another indication of the attitude of the Japanese naval authorities there. Their ban on the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers to public shipping was due to military needs, but they were also eager to provide the greatest possible convenience to the people of third countries. The spokesman also said that the issue of reopening the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers was currently being considered by the local naval authorities, and that navigation could be restored as soon as possible after the mines and remaining Chinese forces were completely cleared.

<h3>"Kinshan" Sails from Hong Kong to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British ship "Kinshan" sailed from here to Guangzhou at 8:00 AM this morning. The anxiety of merchants here caused by the continued blockade of the Pearl River has subsided. The ship carried only forty European passengers as prearranged, and will dock at the Shamian pier. This is the first foreign merchant ship to sail to Guangzhou in a normal state since the Japanese invasion of southern China and the cessation of Pearl River shipping last October. Therefore, some quarters believe that the departure of the "Kinshan" may be a precursor to the complete opening of the Pearl River soon. After the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese military authorities had repeatedly issued declarations that the Pearl River would be opened soon. At that time, Japanese South China Fleet Commander Shiozawa also guaranteed to British Fleet Commander Noble that passenger ships would be allowed to sail on the Pearl River. However, this guarantee was not immediately realized, and Shiozawa has returned to Japan. The Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou, Okazaki, then declared that negotiations on the issue of the opening of the Pearl River had been suspended for fear of hindering the opening of the Yangtze River. It is generally believed that this sudden permission by the Japanese for the "Kinshan" to sail from Hong Kong to Guangdong may presage a departure from the Yangtze River issue and a resumption of the original plan to gradually open the Pearl River. Although the British ship "Wuchang" sailed from Hong Kong to Guangdong on November 23 last year, it was only allowed to load relief supplies for Guangzhou refugees and did not carry passengers.

<h3>New Fourth Route Army: A Team Specializing in Work Among the Enemy Distributes Japanese Recruitment Posters and Japanese Slogans: Xianghe, Captured and Joins Political Work</h3>
<p>Continuation of the dispatch from Mr. Belden, Special Correspondent for the English "Ta Mei Evening News": The political department of the New Fourth Route Army finds it quite easy to work within the army and not difficult to work among the people, and it is quite effective, but work among the enemy is the most difficult and least effective, but the New Fourth Route Army believes that this kind of work has the possibility of success, because the war only benefits the capitalists, and the workers and peasants of Japan do not benefit from it. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Route Army are both working from a theory, that is, the more Japan fights and the greater the difficulties, the more Japanese soldiers and lower-ranking officers will doubt the victory of the war and fear that they will not be able to return home. Yes, the New Fourth Route Army acknowledges that the morale of the Japanese army has not yet collapsed, but there are already signs of it, such as the large number of Japanese soldiers who commit suicide, and the diaries found on the corpses of fallen Japanese soldiers and young officers, which contain the tragic stories of the dead crying and shedding tears when they miss their hometowns, and then prostituting themselves and drinking heavily to relieve their sorrows. The political department uses Japanese posters, letters, pamphlets, and Japanese slogans to work among the enemy. The slogans include "Think of your family", "Don't resist anymore", "Your family has no money since you left home", "Your wife and mother miss you", etc. The New Fourth Route Army has distributed 100,000 of the slogans and posters so far. According to intelligence reports, Japanese soldiers laugh at the posters, some cry, and some take them and put them in their pockets. The New Fourth Route Army's work among the enemy is far less effective than the Eighth Route Army's. The New Fourth Route Army and the Eighth Route Army do not kill prisoners, but treat them kindly. This is well known. A few days ago, I met one of the two prisoners in the General Headquarters. At first, I did not know that he was a prisoner, because he was wearing a blue Chinese army uniform and was writing Japanese letters at the table with some Chinese soldiers. His name is Masao Kouga, 22 years old, graduated from a middle school in Tokyo, and was conscripted last spring. After three months of training, he was transferred to China and joined the transport corps, transporting rice between Nanjing and Zhenjiang on the Yangtze River. According to Kouga, the course of capture was as follows: One day, he and 50 other Japanese soldiers were travelling in six ships from Zhenjiang to Jinshan. Suddenly, a hand grenade fell into the river next to them. The captain ordered them to disembark and lie on the ground and immediately start fighting. The New Fourth Route Army consisted of approximately 300 soldiers. The two sides were 250 yards apart. After an hour of fighting, they had suffered ten casualties. The captain shouted an order for some soldiers to return to Zhenjiang to beg for help. Then ten Japanese soldiers returned on a boat. After more fighting, they felt that they were gradually running out of ammunition, and that they only had one light machine gun, while the New Fourth Route Army had three, so they knew that they were doomed to failure. After another hour of fighting, five more Japanese soldiers were killed. Then a Japanese plane flew over. Although they stood up and waved to it, the plane flew very high and quickly disappeared. Then, suddenly, there was heavy gunfire from the opposite bank of the river behind them. At that time, there were only ten Japanese soldiers left, so they swam across the river and fought again. After half an hour, they ran out of ammunition and scattered in all directions. When Kouga was running away alone, he suddenly encountered 50 Chinese soldiers. He fired his pistol at them, but missed. Instead, a farmer behind him hit him on the head and legs with a stick, and he lost consciousness and was captured. He was taken to a small village five miles away. Because the imprisonment was strict, he gave up the idea of escaping. That day, Kouga was escorted to the General Headquarters. On the way, he met the Minister of Enemy Work of the New Fourth Route Army. The man spoke fluent Japanese, and when he saw Kouga sitting silently among the Chinese soldiers, he stepped forward to ask his name and apologized to Kouga for not being well-received. Kouga met him for the first time and mistakenly thought that he was talking to a Japanese. After five hours of conversation, the man said to Kouga, "We believe that you were forced to come here by warlords and capitalists. You did not want to fight, so we welcome you as a friend." Now, Kouga writes letters and leaflets to the Japanese army for the New Fourth Route Army every day. The New Fourth Route Army treats him extremely well. He earns a salary of five yuan a month, which is one yuan more than the salary of the General Commander of the army. Later, Kouga heard about the simple life movement and voluntarily requested to reduce his salary. Now, he earns three yuan a month. He eats the same food as the personnel in the enemy's political department. In his free time, he takes walks or plays tennis with them, and there are no guards. Because he can only speak a few sentences of Chinese, if he tries to escape, he will be captured by the farmers or even killed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ukraine Forms Three New Provinces: German-Polish Agreement on Ukrainian Question Said to Have Been Reached in New York</h3>

<p>(New York) The "New York Volkszeitung," the organ of the German community here, which was recently banned from being sold in Germany for opposing the anti-Semitic movement, recently published a piece of news that has been highly valued by American political figures. It is claimed that "Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently held talks with German leader Hitler and reached an agreement on the Ukrainian issue, stipulating that the Soviet Ukrainian SSR should be politically incorporated into Polish territory, while Germany would economically control 45 million Ukrainians as a condition of exchange. As for the Polish Corridor, once Germany has firmly established its hegemony in Eastern Europe, it will be resolved according to German will." (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US House Reintroduces Ludlow Amendment: President Has Power to Declare War When the Americas Are Threatened by Invasion</h3>
<p>(Washington) The motion proposed by Indiana Democratic Congressman Louis Ludlow in December 1937, advocating amending the Constitution to abolish the President's power to declare war and to decide on a plebiscite, was opposed by President Roosevelt and failed to pass. Now, Ludlow has submitted this motion to the House Judiciary Committee, with an added proviso stating that the President may still declare war when the United States or another country in the Americas is directly threatened by invasion, without having to go through a plebiscite. Political figures have commented that if Ludlow's faction of Congressmen can accept the government's views and agree to amend the current Neutrality Act, then the government can accept this constitutional amendment as a condition of exchange. (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Republican Congressman Fish has proposed a constitutional amendment stipulating that a plebiscite must be held before American citizens can be conscripted for military service overseas. Fish claims that this amendment excludes the entire Western Hemisphere and overseas American territories, so it does not hinder defense. Members of Congress believe that Fish's amendment has little chance of success, so the movement to make Ludlow's plebiscite law a law has gained momentum. Some believe that the Senate may resist this move, but the House of Representatives will pass it easily. At the same time, the proposal to ban the shipment of arms to Spain is still being advocated strongly. A Reuters reporter has learned that government officials now feel that this is not a matter of isolated action, but should be seen as an integral part of the neutrality issue as a whole. The government now wants to completely revise the current Neutrality Regulations, but if sufficiently pressed by the situation, it is also willing to retain the principle of "cash and carry" orders. If this is the case, when the Neutrality Act is abolished, Spaniards may be allowed to purchase war materials in the United States for cash, and according to the law, it is still necessary to cancel the ban. However, once the principle of neutrality on which the ban is based is abolished, the ban can be cancelled without the political consequences that would follow today. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Attack Jiaxing on Four Routes: Japanese Side Asks Shanghai for Assistance: Japanese Planes Bomb Two Towns</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Communication: The Japanese troops here, after learning that the Chinese troops were attacking the city on four routes, ordered their troops to stay inside as much as possible, and set up machine guns and small steel cannons in various key points in the city and suburbs as precautions, and strictly checked pedestrians. In the evening, the Japanese troops, together with the puppet police, patrolled the city and implemented special martial law to prevent unforeseen events. Furthermore, I learned that yesterday the Chinese troops advanced north from the Wangjiangjing-Suzhou-Jiaxing railway line, arriving near Tanghui Town, more than ten li from the city. The west road advanced east from Yanmu and Xinying, reaching Yangaidun, three li from the city. The south road advanced north from the Nanfeng Shiqu area, reaching near Nanyan. The east road advanced west from between Xinfeng and Pinghu, reaching Jiaoli Street, two li from the city. I heard that when the troops on each route advanced towards the suburbs, they exchanged fire with the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops, because their morale was low, were not dealt a heavy blow, and retreated into the city in embarrassment. The Chinese side then actively advanced and destroyed all the highways and transportation lines. These Chinese troops are now fully besieging Jiaxing on four routes. The Japanese troops in the city have asked Shanghai for assistance, so in the past two days, many Japanese marines have arrived here from Shanghai by railway, and a large number of ammunition and weapons have been transported to Jiaxing and stored in the South Gate military camp.</p>
<p>On the 8th, a team of Japanese aircraft flew from Jiaxing to Wuzhen and Xinpeng Town in the two counties of Tongxiang and Jiaxing for reconnaissance and distributed absurd leaflets to provoke military morale, and then dropped several bombs over Wuzhen, killing and injuring 86 innocent civilians, and other losses were unknown. On the same day, three Japanese aircraft flew over the Haiyan area and dropped bombs, but the exact information is not yet known.</p>

<h3>German Defense Ministry Director Discusses Japan's Wartime Economy: Exhausting the Pond to Catch the Fish Cannot Last: The Future of the War is Favorable to China</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Major General Thomas, Director of the Economic Department of the German Defense Ministry, recently delivered a speech in Weimar, warning against the misuse of the term "sudden war." He then emphasized the importance of economic preparation and war, believing that no matter how optimistic the situation, preparations must be made for a long-term war. Japan has learned this lesson in its current war. Based on the experience of 1938, Thomas confirmed the following three needs: (1) the need for a unified national defense economic organization. It is important for a country to be able to produce its own wartime supplies in wartime. This is clearly evidenced by Japan's difficulties due to the lack of such an organization. (2) The economic foundation of a country is often an important factor in determining the outcome of a war. This fact cannot be ignored, as economic preparation and military equipment are equally important. Deep observation should also be made on the similar facilities of various enemy countries. (3) In the event of war, adequate preparations should be made for the people's food supply. This is even more important in future wars, because the situation in the rear affects the front lines deeply and significantly. He also said that in the event of war, domestic inventory, production, and imports all have their own significant relationships and meanings, and cannot be underestimated. Countries with poor mineral resources and insufficient natural resources must use raw materials economically and strive to increase production in many ways, while also studying the issue of economic warfare. (4) When a country engages in foreign wars, it is best to change international trade and avoid economic warfare as much as possible, but at the same time, it should take active preparations to effectively resist. Regarding wartime finance, Thomas believes that Japan's previous experience is a very valuable lesson. In terms of internal wartime finance, most of it is nothing more than a financial organization issue. However, Japan's method of dealing with internal wartime finance relies entirely on limiting people's consumption to benefit the war. However, this limitation is tantamount to exhausting the pond to catch the fish, which has become intolerable. The reason for this is that Japan's treasury was too poorly prepared when the war began, causing great difficulties. Moreover, external wartime finance is more important, as can be seen from Japan's experience, how important foreign exchange and capital are, because payment for imports cannot be offset by exports, and foreign exchange and reserves are necessary.

<h3>Chinese Minister to Poland Presents Credentials: Mutual Encouragement to Enhance Friendship</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The new Chinese Minister to Poland, Wang Jingqi, was accompanied by the Polish Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Skrakowski, to call on President Moscicki yesterday to present his credentials. In his address, Wang assured that "China has always had sympathy and admiration for Poland, and at the same time, the Chinese people are well aware of the Polish people's sympathy for us during the difficult period of fighting for independence." Wang continued that China and Poland should strengthen cultural and economic relations, as the supply and demand of the two countries are mutually complementary. President Moscicki, in his reply, confirmed the mutual sympathy and respect between the two countries, and stressed that promoting commercial relations between the two countries is the most important element in enhancing Chinese-Polish friendship. After presenting his credentials, Wang went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Poland to lay a wreath. (12th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Plans to Establish a Naval Port in Guam, Japan Expresses Unusual Concern</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Last week, the U.S. Special Naval Committee, led by Rear Admiral Hepburn, proposed a plan to the U.S. Congress to defend Guam, intending to build the island into a strong air force and submarine base to protect the Philippines. According to naval experts, if this proposal were to be implemented, it would cost more than 200 million U.S. dollars. Guam is located 3,000 miles west of Hawaii, between the islands under Japanese mandate. Therefore, today, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy expressed dissatisfaction with this matter, saying that Japan "is very concerned and attaches great importance" to it. The Japanese Navy spokesman also said that last month, when Japanese warships escorted the U.S. ship "Luzon" to Shanghai, "an officer on the 'Luzon' said that Japanese warships were firing aimlessly at both banks of the Yangtze River, wanting the Americans on the 'Luzon' to believe that guerrillas were everywhere on both banks of the Yangtze River and that the Yangtze River was not suitable for navigation." According to officials on the "Luzon," the Japanese warships fired at places on both banks where there were no people. The spokesman believed that this statement was an "insult" to the Japanese Navy. The Japanese side had requested the U.S. side to investigate this matter, but had not yet received a response from the U.S. side. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen Transferred as Ambassador to Turkey</h3>
<p>(London) Former Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, has recently been appointed as Ambassador to Turkey. The current Ambassador to Turkey, Loraine, has been reassigned to Rome to succeed British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Percy Loraine, who will retire in April. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was seriously injured in August 1937 when his car was attacked by Japanese aircraft while traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai. After recuperating for several months at the Hong'en Hospital in Shanghai, he took a cruiser to the Dutch East Indies and then returned to England. The supplementary budget passed by Parliament last March included a grant of £5,000 to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. When answering inquiries in the House of Commons, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler admitted that the grant was unprecedented. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen joined the Foreign Office in 1908 and will be 58 years old this March. He was transferred from Minister to Persia to Ambassador to China in 1936, and previously served as Minister to the Baltic States. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>HSBC Bank Surplus</h3>
<p>(London) The last dividend announced by HSBC Bank last year has been praised by financial writers. The Times believes that this further proves the bank's financial strength and the vitality of Chinese trade despite its deplorable situation. The Manchester Guardian stated that most Chinese ports are now occupied by Japanese troops, and that the bank can still obtain substantial profits under such circumstances, which is sufficient to demonstrate its financial strength. The Financial Times said that a slight decrease in profits is not surprising. The Daily Telegraph stated that this dividend is a remarkable achievement. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>During the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Refugees Permitted to Seek Refuge in the Philippines, Agreement Established Between Chinese and Philippine Governments</h3>
<p>(Manila) An agreement has been reached between the Chinese government and the government of this Republic, allowing Chinese to seek refuge in the Philippines during the Sino-Japanese War. However, it stipulates that refugees must be guaranteed by a resident of the Philippines that they will not rely on public assistance in the future. Furthermore, refugees must obtain approval from the authorities before boarding a ship from China. Personnel from Chinese consulates and chambers of commerce must also be responsible for ensuring that refugees return to their country after the end of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Filled with an Atmosphere of Friendship, British and Italian Talks Continue, General Situation in the Mediterranean Discussed, Britain Refuses to Mediate Franco-Italian Dispute</h3>
<p>(Rome) British and Italian cabinet members held political talks at the Palazzo Venezia at six o'clock yesterday afternoon. According to an official communique, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax went to the Palazzo Venezia at six o'clock in the afternoon and held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano for an hour and a half. It is scheduled to continue the talks tomorrow afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and British Foreign Secretary Halifax held talks for fifty minutes to prepare for the second meeting between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. According to diplomatic sources, Chamberlain has not yet given Mussolini the satisfactory results he expected. The content of the discussion is kept absolutely secret, and all officials participating in the meeting are unwilling to disclose it. Although newspapers under government control have published extensive reports on Chamberlain's arrival in Italy, they do not make any speculation about the content of the discussions, except to praise Chamberlain's efforts to consolidate peace. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the first round of talks between British and Italian cabinet members, well-informed sources here have declared that the British delegation has had a good impression. They say that the talks lasted for an hour and a half, which is more than just a simple meeting. It is said that the British and Italian Prime Ministers and their respective Foreign Ministers had a comprehensive discussion on the international situation. Prime Minister Mussolini spoke first for a considerable length of time, explaining in detail Italy's views on various European issues. What he emphasized was a sincere declaration to Prime Minister Chamberlain that the Fascist Italian government has peaceful aspirations. As for the relationship between France and Italy, both sides touched upon it within the scope of the general situation in the Mediterranean. Regarding this, sources close to the British cabinet members have expressed that Prime Minister Chamberlain does not intend to mediate this matter at length, but can only encourage the Italian authorities to contact the French government directly. In addition, Italian diplomatic circles are extremely silent about the situation of yesterday's talks, only saying that everything was discussed in a friendly atmosphere. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the first round of talks between British and Italian cabinet members this afternoon, well-informed sources here declared that Prime Minister Mussolini mentioned Italy's various demands on France. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately refused to discuss them at length and advocated that the Italian authorities should stop the "recovery of lost territories" movement in the newspapers and negotiate directly with France. Once considerable progress has been made, Britain is willing to help them reach a smooth solution. Political figures said that Italy's various demands must be implemented and that Germany will definitely fully support them. Prime Minister Mussolini is trying to seek British support for Italy's territorial demands on French Somaliland in East Africa and for revising the border between French Tunisia in North Africa and Italian Libya. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The first meeting between British and Italian politicians was quite successful, which can be seen from the smiling faces of the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. The purpose of this meeting seemed to be to establish friendship between the British Foreign Secretary and the Italian Foreign Minister. A few days ago, British and Italian newspapers had anticipated the matter in optimistic tones, and now it is even more concrete. Although the atmosphere of this meeting was good, both sides still harbored suspicions. This was evident in the Spanish question and Franco-Italian relations. It is generally believed that in the first meeting, both sides briefly expressed their views on various specific issues, not limited to confirming attitudes and positions. British political figures here are making every effort to declare that the British politicians are not seeking concrete results from this meeting. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Entourage Arrives in Rome, Receives Warm Welcome from Italian Government and Public</h3>
<p>Rome. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain and his entourage arrived in Rome yesterday afternoon, they were warmly welcomed by the Italian government and public, reaching a climax. The station almost turned into an auditorium, with flowers covering the ground and national flags covering the sky. The platform walkways were all covered with red velvet carpets, and troops were lined up inside and outside the station. When the special train entered the station at a quarter past four in the afternoon, bugles sounded loudly, and cheers of "Long live Chamberlain and Halifax" rang out at the same time. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax had just alighted from the train when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano stepped forward to shake hands, appearing extremely friendly. When the military band played the British and Italian national anthems, the British Prime Minister and his entourage stood at attention with their hats off. Then, they inspected the guard of honor and walked shoulder to shoulder with the Italian Prime Minister and his entourage in a crowd of British expatriates on both sides. The British expatriates cheered and sang the national anthem together, echoing in the clouds, drowning out the sound of the military band. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini wore a black coat of the Fascist Legion. When he was waiting at the station, he looked very happy and chatted with British Ambassador Loraine and others. The weather was excellent that day, but the sunlight was obscured by clouds. The British Prime Minister still carried his famous umbrella. They successively left the station and entered a square decorated with fountains, the Adowa Fallen Soldiers Memorial Arch, and giant lions brought from the capital of Abyssinia. Military police lined up to form a security line to prevent the cheering crowd along the road from crowding in. The British Prime Minister and his entourage then boarded cars and went to the Villa Madama, which faces the mountains and the water, and served as the British Prime Minister's temporary headquarters. When the cars passed through streets lined with soldiers on both sides, cheers were incessant. From the station to the villa, a distance of two and a half miles, every household hung flags to show their welcome. After arriving at the villa twenty minutes later, the British Prime Minister and his entourage drove to the municipal office and signed the golden registration book. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Palazzo Venezia Hosts Banquet for Distinguished Guests, Mutually Encouraging Each Other with Goodwill and Cooperation</h3>
<p>Rome. At seven o'clock in the evening, Mussolini hosted a banquet at the Palazzo Venezia. The talks lasted for an hour and five minutes. The Italian side was represented by Mussolini and Ciano, and the British side by Chamberlain and Halifax. The atmosphere during the talks was very friendly. It is said that the discussion was purely general in nature. They will meet again at five thirty this afternoon. When the British Prime Minister and his entourage arrived at the Palazzo Venezia, they were also warmly welcomed. Thousands of people gathered along the way and cheered enthusiastically, and Chamberlain frequently waved his hat to thank them. Italian officials did not publish a notice asking the public to welcome the distinguished guests, but the public gathered entirely voluntarily, as they all wanted to see the politician who saved Europe from war last September. After the British Prime Minister and his entourage arrived at the Palazzo Venezia, the Italian side presented them with bouquets.</p>
<p>Chamberlain gave a speech, saying, "I have come here today as the representative of a great nation. The nation I represent wishes to maintain a close, friendly, and cordial relationship with another great nation. I and Halifax are deeply moved by the goodwill shown by the Italian Prime Minister towards me personally and my country, and by the warm welcome of the people of Rome. We are delighted to revisit Italy and to see the strong, enterprising, and new Italy under Mussolini's leadership. The Italian Prime Minister praised me for resolving the crisis last September. In fact, the peaceful outcome of the Munich Conference was brought about by the Italian Prime Minister's assistance and cooperation, for which I am deeply grateful. I have come here to carry out the policies I advocate. What are these policies? They are to express goodwill to all parties, not to express hostility to any party, and to strive to resolve international difficulties through negotiation in a spirit of fairness and peace. I am pleased that the British and Italian governments have been able to give concrete expression to this policy in their agreement. The two governments have begun to exchange military intelligence, which is one of the first effects of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. We all know that our interests in the Mediterranean, although of great importance to both of us, do not need to conflict with each other. Therefore, we are confident that the Anglo-Italian Agreement has opened a new chapter in Anglo-Italian friendship and trust, which will be beneficial to the stability of Europe's future. I hope that the two countries will cooperate to carry out the work of seeking lasting peace in Europe." After the British Prime Minister finished speaking, he raised his glass to toast the health of the King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia and the welfare of the Italian people.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini then rose to raise his glass to the health of the British Prime Minister and his entourage, and expressed the Italian people's sympathy for the British Prime Minister's and the British government's efforts. He said that when Chamberlain sought to resolve the major and difficult problems facing Europe last September in a fair manner, the greatness and firmness of spirit he displayed, and the unwavering determination with which he carried out the process of reconciliation, were greatly admired by Italy. Italy has always believed that peace is based on justice, and this is the ultimate goal of the Fascist Italian people. The recently implemented Anglo-Italian Agreement has placed Anglo-Italian relations on a sound footing, not only reforming the friendship between the two countries in the new landscape of friendship and understanding of new realities in the Mediterranean and Africa, but also opening up avenues for cooperation. This cooperation is an essential element of European peace, and we sincerely hope that it will be lasting and effective. In addition to this hope, I also personally wish to offer my sincere friendship to the British Prime Minister. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Pay Respects to the Italian King, Attend Palace Luncheon</h3>
<p>(Rome) When British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax drove to the Quirinal Palace for a luncheon this afternoon, they were greeted with cheers from the crowd along the way. Those attending the luncheon included Prince Piedmont of Italy, Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, Ambassador to Britain Grandi, British Ambassador to Italy Loraine, Italian cabinet members, and key members of the Italian royal family. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met at 10:15 this morning. The talks will not end until midnight or later. At 11:00 this morning, Chamberlain and Halifax went to the former royal tombs of Italy to lay wreaths. At 11:15, they went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay wreaths. They will meet the Italian Emperor at 1:30 PM and will be hosted for lunch by the Italian Emperor. At 3:00 PM, they will go to the new marble stadium of Mussolini to watch the gymnastics performance of the representatives of the Fascist Youth League. At 5:30 PM, they will go to the Palazzo Venezia for the second round of talks with Hitler. They will go to the Royal Opera House to watch a play tonight and attend Ciano's banquet at 11:00 PM. Chamberlain has been socializing every night since he arrived here, but his spirits are still good. Italian officials are surprised. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Persuade Italian Prime Minister to Support Restoration of the Spanish Monarchy, Promises Financial Aid as a Condition for Italian Withdrawal</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Spanish issue, responsible sources here have declared that British Prime Minister Chamberlain will suggest to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that he mediate the Spanish civil war and restore the monarchy, with Prince Don Juan, the son of the deposed King Alfonso, succeeding to the throne. While Prime Minister Mussolini is likely to reject any measures that would change the current military balance in Spain to the advantage of the government forces, it is not impossible that he will agree to Prime Minister Chamberlain's suggestion. Regarding this, there are many people in Britain who support the restoration of the monarchy because of the kinship between the British and Spanish royal families. One of them is Winston Churchill, the leader of the extreme conservative party. Furthermore, when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini received Spanish monarchists on March 31, 1934, he expressed his willingness for Spain to form a regency government to prepare for the restoration of the monarchy to replace the republican system. (This statement by Prime Minister Mussolini was published by the British Manchester Guardian last year, and the Italian side has not yet acknowledged it.) He will not object to it now. When British Prime Minister Chamberlain meets with Pope Pius XI in the coming days, he will also seek the Vatican's opinion on this issue. Responsible sources here also said that when the British and French cabinet members held talks in Paris yesterday, they decided to refuse to recognize the Spanish Nationalists as a belligerent entity. If Italian combatants can completely withdraw from Spain, Britain may grant Italy commercial credit loans and certain economic benefits. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Observers here are commenting on the talks between British and Italian cabinet members from an economic perspective, saying that if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can prove that he has a willingness to compromise on various European political issues, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will give him important compensation in financial and economic terms to help him develop Abyssinia. The method is to accommodate a large number of Jewish immigrants in Abyssinia, so that the large sums of money raised by the Jewish immigration associations of various countries can be used in Abyssinia. When U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips met with Mussolini yesterday, he made a similar suggestion on behalf of President Roosevelt, at which time Prime Minister Mussolini's attitude was quite amenable. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Openly Supports Italian Demands</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The "Political-Diplomatic Correspondence," known as the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently published an important article supporting Italy's various demands regarding the Mediterranean. In addition, "German Foreign Political Information," a small booklet with a red cover, is only published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when a major event occurs that requires it to state its position solemnly. It has also recently reprinted this article. The responsible German authorities are expressing this kind of attitude towards Italy's various demands. This is the first time. The original article is roughly as follows: "The current situation in the Mediterranean is not a definite reality. For example, the mandates of Syria and Palestine, and even Spain, contain points of crisis that are sufficient to cause changes in the balance of power in the Mediterranean. The Italian factor is very different from the past, and the countries of the world cannot ignore it. It has now become a strong country in the Mediterranean and has the right to make new demands on countries that have already obtained political and economic benefits on the Mediterranean coast. In short, the unified Italian nation is a reality and maintains reliable allies. The demands it makes are very legitimate and all this must be recognized." Furthermore, the pacification of the Mediterranean concerns Britain's survival. Direct exchanges of views between countries are the best way. "Italy is an ally of Germany, and Germany hopes that the talks currently being held in Rome between British and Italian cabinet members will satisfy Italy's wishes, facilitate solutions, and not conflict with the interests of the countries concerned." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Milan. Italian newspapers are commenting on the speeches delivered by the two prime ministers when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini hosted a banquet for British Prime Minister Chamberlain last night. "Il Secolo" wrote, "Although Chamberlain's speech was entirely diplomatic, it was the words of a sincere person who truly wants to negotiate." The newspaper extended Mussolini's desire for peace, saying that peace and fairness are inseparable. The metabolism of history is accompanied by the emergence of new problems and the rise of new countries. When the environment changes, interests also change. Today, Italy has a population of 44 million, and more than 10 million expatriates living abroad. How can it still maintain the situation when it had a population of 21 million? Now that the African Empire has been conquered by Italy, how can Italy be long restricted by other countries in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean? And while other countries can use clever methods to obtain privileged status, can Italy not make demands? (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Tricks, Attempting to Alienate Britain and France</h3>
<p>London dispatch. The first round of talks between British and Italian cabinet members in Rome yesterday has been commented on by the newspapers here, saying that this was limited to "general discussions of the general situation." A certain newspaper also said that Prime Minister Mussolini meant that "certain issues were not ripe" and preferred to shelve them temporarily. The Conservative Morning Post carried a dispatch from a Rome correspondent stating that Prime Minister Mussolini firmly believes that the Nationalists will win the Spanish civil war soon and is unwilling to discuss it. He also wants Prime Minister Chamberlain to come forward to mediate the dispute between France and Italy or try to convene a Four-Power Conference, including Germany, to discuss general European issues and to acknowledge Italy's political wishes regarding French Tunisia. How is British policy regarding this? Prime Minister Chamberlain apparently expressed nothing, neither on this day nor on other days, but listened to Prime Minister Mussolini's views. This trip did not bring any concessions with it. In addition, the left-wing newspapers have more anxieties. The Labour Daily Herald said, "Anyone who knows Prime Minister Mussolini's tricks knows what his goal is. In other words, Mussolini wants to induce Britain to refuse to support France and let it be isolated, thereby forcing it to make concessions and even wanting Britain to provide assistance and declare to France that European peace is more important than the port of Djibouti in French East Africa and the Suez Canal Company's shares and cannot insist on its own opinions. In short, Prime Minister Mussolini is determined to use Prime Minister Chamberlain's weaknesses to get Prime Minister Chamberlain to support Italy's claims and become estranged from France, even if the achievement is small."

<h3>Mothers of Lost Children in Spain Painfully Describe the Horrors of Aerial Bombardment, Urge British Prime Minister to Find Ways to Stop It</h3>
<p>(London) According to the Spanish News Agency, the Congress of the Spanish Republic sent two telegrams to Rome, addressed to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, protesting the Nationalist aerial bombardments in Spain. One of them, signed by "The Mothers of Lost Children in Spain," stated, "The mothers of Madrid, Valencia, and Barcelona have witnessed their children being bombed by foreign aircraft, their limbs torn apart and dying tragically. Now that the Rome talks are underway, we are calling out to you from the depths of our hearts and pain, please stop this indescribable barbaric bombardment." Another telegram was sent by the British ship captains in Barcelona, stating, "We buried our friend Mr. Fashin yesterday, who was the chief engineer of the British ship 'Ailesford.' He was killed by Nationalist aircraft bombing while performing his legitimate duties. We must demand full protection for British ships and those serving on them, which are engaged in legitimate trade and are loyal to the glorious traditions of the British merchant marine."

<h3>German Head of State Follows Custom: New Year's Reception for Diplomatic Corps; Hitler's Response to Congratulatory Message: Hope for Peaceful Understanding Among Nations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Head of State traditionally receives important domestic figures and members of the diplomatic corps at the beginning of the New Year. However, the grand ceremony held at the New Chancellery was a first. This morning at 11:00 AM, Hitler, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, received Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Göring, Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder, Army Commander-in-Chief Brauchitsch, and Chief of Staff General Keitel. Following this, he received the Police Chief and the Mayor of Berlin, Lippert, who conveyed the respect and New Year's greetings of the people of the German capital. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Head of State Hitler received the diplomatic corps at noon today at the new location of the Chancellery to celebrate the New Year. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Chancellery Secretary of State Meissner, and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Keitel were all present. Papal Nuncio Archbishop Orsenigo, in his capacity as leader of the diplomatic corps, delivered a congratulatory speech, stating: "The historical year has passed, and we express our respect to the courageous politicians who signed the Munich Agreement, and thank them as peace-loving people." Head of State Hitler's response stated: "Our nation's inalienable right to national self-determination was manifested in practice in 1938 without disturbing the peace, which is gratifying. This is due to the wise policies pursued by the nations concerned, which led to the conclusion of the Munich Agreement." Understanding among nations not only preserves peace in Europe, but also leads to the birth of a more robust and peaceful Europe, for which the German nation is deeply grateful. It is hoped that this understanding will be maintained, and that the natural and justified interests of all nations will be taken into account. It is noted that among the heads of missions, US Ambassador Wilson has not yet returned to his post, British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson has returned home for convalescence due to illness, and the Chilean Ambassador, and the envoys of Bolivia and Colombia have also returned to their countries and did not participate. On the German side, Propaganda Minister Goebbels was also absent. (British and American newspapers have reported on Minister Goebbels' scandalous affairs). (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Germany to Divide World Markets: Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>(London) British and German industrial groups and manufacturers are actively engaged in talks in London and Berlin to discuss ways to divide up major markets. Once a consensus is reached, formal negotiations will be conducted by the Federation of British Industries and the Federation of German Industries. The Federation of British Industries is compiling various intelligence regarding the views of both sides and is scheduled to begin discussions on the 18th of this month regarding the dispatch of official representatives to Berlin. Well-informed sources in the British industrial sector have commented that the German side originally intended to limit the scope of the discussion to the two countries and not involve third countries. There is hope for an agreement on the division of markets in the Balkan Peninsula countries, as Germany cannot independently meet the needs of these countries, and these countries do not want Germany to completely control their economic activities. It is generally expected that after Germany makes concessions in the Balkans, it will then demand reciprocal conditions, with Britain making certain concessions in the Scandinavian Peninsula markets. For example, Germany needs iron ore produced in Sweden, but its purchases from that country have decreased due to a lack of foreign currency. In the future, it will certainly ask for British assistance. In addition, the prospects for reaching an agreement on the division of markets in South American countries between Britain and Germany are slim, as the American industrial sector is bound to fiercely resist.

<h3>Successful Government Offensive in Southern Spain: Only Eight Miles from the Seville-Salamanca Railway Line; Rebel Counter-Attack Repulsed</h3>
<p>Barcelona: According to sources here, the government forces fighting on the Estremadura front are currently developing a pincer movement with considerable success. The aim is to encircle the Nationalist reserves concentrated between Rubiovo and Castuera. Although the Nationalists have dispatched reinforcements from Cordoba, Seville, and Cadiz for a counter-attack, they have been repulsed. Government forces have now advanced to within eight miles of the Seville-Salamanca railway line. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: The Spanish government's Ministry of National Defense announced in an official statement last night that government forces attacked enemy positions in Estremadura yesterday, capturing a Nationalist military depot containing two artillery pieces, four heavy machine guns, six light machine guns, numerous trench mortars, eighty-seven rifles, 33,000 artillery shells, 1,400 bombs, 200 hand grenades, and 3,000 tank bombs, achieving an unprecedented victory. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: At the positions of Celra and Maspère on the Catalan front, the Nationalist forces have repeatedly launched attacks, but all have been repulsed by government forces. After the Nationalist forces transferred artillery reinforcements, they continued to fiercely attack the government positions, but were also unsuccessful. Although they once occupied three hilltops, they were recaptured by government forces in a counter-attack before they could establish a firm foothold. Two Nationalist aircraft were shot down by government anti-aircraft fire. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Renewed Conflicts on the Hungarian-Czech Border</h3>
<p>Prague: A new incident occurred near Belwenkowce on the Ruthenian-Hungarian border. According to a Ruthenian report, Hungarian forces opened fire across the border on Tuesday night, resulting in a one-hour conflict. The Hungarian side used one heavy machine gun and two light machine guns, and threw hand grenades. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Gunfire Directed at German Consulates and Embassies in the Netherlands: Berlin Lodges Protest; Netherlands Agrees to Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German news agency reported last night that on the night of the 6th of this month, someone fired shots into the reception room of the private residence of the German Consul-General in The Hague in an attempted assassination. Although the Dutch authorities immediately launched a strict search for the perpetrator, a similar incident occurred on the night of the 9th to a secretary at the German Embassy in The Hague. German newspapers only published the news about this matter, without comment. Political figures believe that these unfortunate incidents are the work of international Jews, who are targeting German diplomats in certain locations. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People here are extremely indignant about the news that the German Consulate in Amsterdam and the German Embassy in The Hague were shot at. The German government has lodged a protest with the Dutch government. Local newspapers attribute the above two incidents to incitement by Dutch Jews. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The Dutch government has agreed to the request of the German Ambassador to the Netherlands, Zech, to thoroughly investigate the shooting incidents at the German Consulate in Amsterdam and the German Embassy in The Hague. Special guards are currently stationed in front of the German Embassy and consulates to provide protection. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>American Bombers Fly in Formation: From California to Panama to Participate in Atlantic Maneuvers</h3>
<p>(Washington) Forty-eight twin-engine giant seaplanes that departed from San Diego, California, yesterday morning have, according to a dispatch from Cristóbal, Panama, flown in one go to their base at Coco Solo, near the Panama Canal. The entire journey of 4,800 kilometers took only 25 hours. They will soon fly to Guantánamo Bay on the eastern coast of Cuba to join the US fleet for exercises in the Caribbean Sea.

<h3>Jewish Emigration Problem: Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources have declared that the emigration of German Jews is fraught with difficulties. Not only is funding lacking, but the problem of resettlement is also extremely difficult. Germany's neighboring countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, only allow these Jews to transit or reside temporarily. It is not possible in the short term to resettle them in British colonies in Africa, such as Tanganyika, Rhodesia, or British Guiana in South America. Most other countries have not expressed their position on the issue of accepting Jewish refugees. Therefore, there is great anticipation for the outcome of Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome, where he will discuss the issue of Jewish emigration to Abyssinia with Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the issue of Jewish emigration, representatives of the International Committee for the Settlement of Refugees from Germany and Austria, namely Lubbock, Chairman of the Standing Committee in London, and Committee member Paul, visited Dr. Schacht, President of the Central Bank, today. They conducted discussions based on the proposals previously made by Schacht during his visit to London. No compromise solution was reached. Further progress must await Schacht reporting the situation to the government and seeking instructions. According to Schacht's proposals, the key points are: First, 150,000 young Jews should be emigrated. The total cost of emigration is 1,500,000,000 Reichsmarks, equivalent to 18,000,000,000 French francs, which should be raised by the countries concerned, and an equivalent amount of "frozen" funds should be established in Germany as collateral.

<h3>President Roosevelt's Private Residence: To Be Donated to the Government After Death</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt announced that the deed to his house and surrounding 100 acres of land at Hyde Park in New York State will be transferred to the government after his death. He will also store his collected writings in the house so that they will be easily accessible to future scholars. A building for storing the writings will be built separately. The style will be simple and made of stone to prevent fire. Half of the cost will be raised by public donation, and after completion, it will also be handed over to the government. President Roosevelt also said that all proceeds from the sale of his writings to newspapers, magazines, and book publishers, after deducting taxes, will be used to help fund this endeavor. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Naval Construction Plan: Willing to Abide by the Restrictions of Naval Treaties</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German "Völkischer Beobachter" reported that Germany does not currently intend to build submarines and heavy cruisers to the limits stipulated by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Due to technical reasons, the shipbuilding program cannot be completed immediately. According to sources in the German Navy, of the 71 submarines being built by Germany, only 43 have been completed. Construction will not continue until the remaining 28 are finished. It is estimated that Germany would be satisfied with one-third of the naval power of Great Britain. This shows that German naval power is entirely defensive in nature. Germany does not currently wish to conquer colonies in North and South America, nor does it wish to establish naval hegemony in the Mediterranean. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Elimination of Guerrilla Impostors: Harassment by Those Posing as Guerrillas Arouses Public Resentment and Should Be Eradicated</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: Since guerrilla forces in various places launched the war of resistance and national salvation, they have significantly contained Japanese military strength. However, some cunning people have been posing as guerrillas, engaging in arbitrary harassment, which has aroused public resentment and is deeply distressing. Recently, the "Don't Be a Slave" Speaking Troupe has been analyzing who the real and fake guerrillas are, so that the people can distinguish between them. The railway team of the troupe is conducting speaking tours along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Suzhou-Jiaxing railway lines, explaining that the standard for genuine guerrillas is not wanting money, not fearing death, not being slaves, saving the common people, and fighting well. Their speaking topics include "Personality Warfare, Personality Education and Personality Warfare, Broad Warfare, Broad Warfare and Narrow Warfare," etc. It is said that the guerrillas themselves have been moved by this and have started a purification movement. It is expected that after the purification movement, the obstacles to cooperation between the people and the government will be cleared away, and the guerrilla tactics will be even more effective.</p>
<h3>The Xu Department of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army: Mutiny in Dinghai Because of Refusal to Obey Orders to Relocate and Reorganize; Suppressed Before Leaving Dinghai</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Dinghai County is formed of islands, making transportation extremely inconvenient. On the 24th of last month, over 300 men of the Fifth Battalion of the [number illegible] Branch of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee, led by Xu Chengde, claimed to have retreated from Fengxian and temporarily stationed themselves in Dinghai. County Magistrate Lin Shize, considering that the unit had fought bravely in Shanghai and were all loyal and courageous soldiers, consulted with local gentry and merchants to take good care of them, and telegraphed to his superiors for instructions. On the 27th, the unit assisted the local police in suppressing bandits on Xiazhizhi Island, killing more than ten bandits, capturing sixty-nine alive, and seizing one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, and more than twenty rifles. On the 1st of this month, County Magistrate Lin, acting on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the [number illegible] Army Group, ordered the unit to proceed to Xinchang for reorganization. Xu demanded 50,000 yuan in military pay and provisions from the county and claimed that the bandits captured on Xiazhizhi Island were from their guerrilla unit, demanding their immediate release. County Magistrate Lin refused because he had not received orders and because it concerned public security. To prevent a mutiny, he telegraphed the Haimen water police unit to come to Dinghai to suppress [them]. Unexpectedly, Xu's unit launched an uprising that night, occupying key coastal points. At around 5:00 AM the next morning, the Meda transport, carrying the fifth detachment of water police from Haimen, arrived in Dinghai. Xu's unit fired machine guns to prevent them from landing. The first water police team stationed in Dinghai fired back in warning, leading to a conflict. County Magistrate Lin led the self-defense team to support the street fighting. However, because the police force was weak, more than twenty rifles were confiscated, the telegraph lines were cut, severing all external communications. More than two hundred prisoners in the county jail were released, making the situation unprecedentedly serious. Residents closed their doors and hid. In the afternoon, the Tianbao and Libao transports, carrying passengers and goods from Ningbo to Dinghai, were fired upon by Xu's unit about three miles from Dinghai at Zhushanmen. Gunfire rained down on the bows of the ships, so the two ships detoured to Huoshaomen to avoid danger and sailed to Shenjiamen. Early in the morning of the next day (the 3rd), police reinforcements from Zhenhai and nearby islands arrived. The unit then took the prisoners aboard the Tianma transport, towing six sailboats, and sailed to Hengliang Island in the Putuo waters to await the authorities' reorganization. In this battle, three policemen and two civilians were killed, and about seven or eight people were injured. The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters dispatched a high-ranking official aboard the Haihu patrol ship to Dinghai to pacify the situation. Local order has now been restored.</p>
<h3>The Dang Kou Guerrilla Forces Attacked the Japanese Army: Arrested More Than Twenty Traitors</h3>
<p>Dang Kou Correspondence: Dang Kou is located in the center of the three counties of Su, Yu, and Xi, all more than thirty li away. In 1935, the National Government moved the Liu He Saltworks [illegible], amounting to millions of yuan worth of salt. When the full-scale war of resistance broke out in 1937, the National Army withdrew west, and although the Japanese army passed through, they did not station troops there. Unexpectedly, Hua Chuiyu, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and standing committee member of the town Party headquarters, came forward to organize a puppet maintenance association, sending personnel to guard the saltworks and openly sell the salt. Hua Hengqing, hearing this news, became jealous and engaged in open and secret struggles. To gain the upper hand, Hua Chuiyu invited the Japanese army from Wuxi to garrison the saltworks. After the Japanese army arrived, in addition to raping women, they also seized the stored salt. Hua Chuiyu, however, was rewarded for his flattery and was the first to be granted a pass by the Japanese army to procure a large number of Japanese goods in Shanghai. Subsequently, others went to Shanghai to buy Japanese goods one after another, making it a market for promoting Japanese goods. Last winter, various charitable estates, relying on the power of the Japanese army, opened granaries to collect rent, gathering over a hundred puppet police to intimidate the villagers, collecting the rent for the previous year as well. Any slight delay was treated as rent resistance, and the empty houses of the charitable estates were used as large-scale prisons, detaining hundreds of farmers. The guerrilla forces learned of this and, on the evening of the 7th of this month, deployed more than 400 people in multiple directions to Dang Kou. They first sent a suicide squad to attack the Japanese army inside the saltworks, and then separately captured traitors and rent collection instigators. They captured more than twenty people, including Hua Chenqing, the manager of the Yong Sheng Qian Zhuang who handled the charity estate (Hua Rongzhou's younger brother), Hua Zhuxuan, the accounting director of the puppet maintenance association and manager of the Yong Sheng Zhuang, Hua Chuishu (Chuishu's younger brother), and puppet police officers. Important traitors Hua Chuiyu and Hua Xuemei are still at large. It is now reported that the families of the traitors are planning to raise funds to [illegible]. The battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies lasted for about two hours. As a result, more than thirty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and one Chinese soldier was killed and three wounded. The Chinese army then withdrew northward. At noon the next day, the Japanese army arrived from Wuxi with about one hundred people in six boats and conducted a large-scale search, but found nothing and left.</p>
<h3>The Number of People from Chao Shan Going Overseas Has Increased Sharply: However, Ports in Nanyang Have Increased Taxes and Restricted Imports</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Due to the outbreak of war and the difficulty of life in Chao and Mei, the number of people going overseas to make a living has doubled. The British and Dutch colonies in Nanyang have a fixed quota for the entry of overseas Chinese, so ship tickets are expensive. The import taxes in various ports have also recently increased. Siam and Annam have increased them the most. Those going to Siam must pay a head tax of 150 baht per person and a residence tax of 12 baht per year, now increased to 212 baht. Annam requires an entry tax of 24 yuan, now increased to 36 yuan. It is recently heard that Singapore will also require an entry and inspection tax. Rangoon requires a passport for entry. At the Shantou port, various exports are still conducted as usual. Ship tickets to Singapore, starting this month, have increased for male passengers from 180 yuan (Hong Kong dollars) to more than 200 yuan per ticket, and for female passengers from 80 yuan to more than 180 yuan. Due to the sharp increase in those going overseas, travel expenses and taxes have also increased step by step. However, most of those going overseas are family members of overseas Chinese or those with industrial and commercial relations overseas. On average, there are more than 4,000 people per month. Although they have been increased, they have not decreased as a result. In previous years, overseas Chinese remitted more than 300 million yuan back to China. This year, due to exchange rates (the depreciation of the legal tender), it has increased significantly, reaching about 600 million yuan by the end of the year. The government has established banks throughout Nanyang to absorb remittances from overseas Chinese as foreign exchange funds, and at the same time, has established branches in various counties and cities in Fujian and Guangdong to facilitate the receipt of remittances by the families of overseas Chinese. Both the government and the people benefit. Since the war of resistance, financial stability and social order have remained normal in Fujian and Guangdong, and people's lives have been adjusted. The remittances of overseas Chinese from Nanyang have also been related to this.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special Edition: Buddhism and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhifeng</p>
<p>(I) The Essence of Buddhism and Its Transformation After Coming to China</p>
<p>Buddhism has been circulating for over two thousand nine hundred years. Because it originated in India, which had the highest level of cultural development in the world at the time, and because of Shakyamuni's immense wisdom, he thoroughly realized the truth of the universe and human life. He manifested it as a wondrous, unobstructed wheel of Dharma. The light of wisdom illuminated the darkness, and the wise, upon hearing the Way, immediately understood it. Whether in ancient or modern times, whether in the East or West, regardless of ethnicity, the truth of the universe and human life remains unchanged. The sound of the wheel of truth, thoroughly realized, also remains unchanged. Just as humanity needs air, which remains the same throughout history and across the globe, the truth that Shakyamuni thoroughly realized is the same. Even today, more than two thousand years later, humanity cannot but need this truth. Therefore, I say that Buddhism is a Buddhism that is ever new.</p>
<p>Although there are various ways to explain the essence of Buddhism, and its state varies with the era of its spread, geography, ethnicity, lifestyle, culture, and customs, it only differs in quantity, not in quality. What is its quality? It is wisdom and compassion.</p>
<p>Wisdom is the thorough realization of the truth of the universe and human life. Therefore, the object of wisdom is truth. Compassion is the thorough salvation of sentient beings who are deluded by falsehood. Therefore, the object of compassion is sentient beings (referring to humans and other animals). Seeking one's own liberation and abandoning all sentient beings, even if one realizes a partial truth, one has not achieved thoroughness. This is Hinayana Buddhism, with small wisdom and no compassion, a negative path. The so-called great white ox cart cannot be driven by a lame donkey. Shakyamuni had already denounced it as a scorched sprout and rotten seed. However, those who criticize Buddhism often cite similar Hinayana Buddhism, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The wisdom of Mahayana Buddhism integrates various methods of cultivation to experience truth, realize truth, transform from delusion to truth, and from truth to the mundane, to achieve the illusion of no self, no person, no sentient being, and no life span. It completely reveals the true nature of the universe and human life. Therefore, wisdom, one of the essences of Buddhism, is empty wisdom, which means emptying our traditional prejudices, selfish views, and biased attachments, peeling away the layers to reach the true nature. Although the method may seem negative, the truth sought to be attained is the positive goal. However, people often refer to Buddhism as the "empty gate," but they do not know that when the "empty gate" is opened, the hall of truth is revealed. Those who are subjectively self-righteous are not qualified to speak deeply about this.</p>
<p>The compassion of Buddhism relies on wisdom, and wisdom relies on principle. Therefore, the compassion of Buddhism is not purely subjective emotion but an emotion based on reason and appropriateness. Great wisdom realizes the principle, penetrates the truth and falsehood, perceives heaven and earth as one finger, and all things as one horse. Sentient beings, however, are attached to biases, clinging to this and rejecting that, creating something from nothing, chasing falsehood and being deluded by truth, remaining in the long night without dawn. They indulge in material desires and compete for their own strengths, struggle for power and seize public justice. Dragons and snakes rise from the land, tragedies flourish, human life is immersed in the river of affliction, and the world is reduced to a bloody realm. Because of one thought of delusion, we feel the suffering of shared bad karma. Only empty wisdom can eliminate delusion and [save] sentient beings from the abyss of self-creation [of evil]. Shakyamuni realized this principle himself and was called the All-Knowing One. He returned to guide the deluded and foolish with this principle and was called the Greatly Compassionate Sage. Without empty wisdom, there is no way to inspire great compassion; without great compassion, there is no way to realize empty wisdom. Forgetting both compassion and wisdom, and unifying self and others, is the sole essence of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Looking at the thousands of scriptures and treatises of Buddhism, the subtle principles they expound, which are supreme, profound, and consistent, do not go beyond this essence. Only the ways of explaining and expressing it are extremely simple, fully revealed in one sentence or half a verse, or even in silence; or they are extremely complex, revealed over countless eons like the sands of the Ganges, and still cannot exhaust the dust on the earth. Only through realization can one enter; all else is mere tangled vines.</p>
<p>Such extremely brilliant and concise Buddhism cannot be accepted by a nation with a very high level of culture, let alone be promoted and developed. Therefore, Southeast Asian countries only inherited its Hinayana. The ethnic groups of Tibet and Mongolia predominantly practice the esoteric Buddhism of its late stages, while Korea and Japan only transmitted the remnants of the entire Buddhist vehicle. Only China can swallow it freely, promote and develop it greatly. Therefore, Chinese Buddhism occupies the position of the second ancestor in the world. The schools of Nature, Characteristics, Discipline, and Esotericism accepted the original Indian Buddhist philosophy. The schools of Chan, Pure Land, Tiantai, and Huayan were created by China itself and contain the color of fusing with China's original highest culture. At the same time, anyone studying the history of Chinese culture from the late Eastern Han Dynasty to today cannot but emphasize the ideas of Buddhism. Therefore, Indian Buddhism and Chinese culture are almost inseparable as two.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, China's cultural enterprises have always been controlled by the aristocratic class, and the seeds of reading have always identified with Confucianism. Even the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties, which outwardly practiced Confucianism but inwardly embraced Buddhism, still rejected Buddhism, causing the true face of Buddhism, except for the diligent elucidation by eminent monks and virtuous people, to be only touched upon by a small number of scholars who loved learning and lived in seclusion, and by literati and officials who claimed elegance, who only took one or two Chan stories to aid their idle talk, thus trapping the path of Buddhist missionary forms in a narrow path. However, winning over the basic masses is the key to establishing a solid religion. The profound and vast Buddhism, having encountered such adversity, had no choice but to disguise itself to emerge, suppressing those above and taking from those below. Therefore, Chan Buddhism used a koan, and Pure Land Buddhism used a phrase, Amitabha, to broadcast and guide the general public with simple and direct methods. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, it has swept the country. The impact is such that even foolish men and women can sit in meditation and practice, greatly representing the entire concept of Chinese Buddhism. The self-power of Chan Buddhism and the other-power of Pure Land Buddhism, although their methods of cultivation are different, their elimination of understanding is the same. The lower levels of society lack the ability to understand the true face of Buddhism, but the need to seek understanding is an innate human instinct. Since the true face of Buddhism cannot be understood, all the superstitions of China's original customs are attached to Buddhism, and the atheistic and rational Buddhism is transformed into a polytheistic, materialistic, and superstitious Buddhism. The true spirit of Buddhism is almost completely lost. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Acknowledge Fierce Battles Near Hangzhou: Chinese Army Division Resists for Over a Year; Ten Thousand Soldiers Launched a Fierce Attack on New Year's Day; Extremely Intense Fighting Continues for Days in the Northwest of Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports: At a press conference held by the Japanese yesterday (the 11th), the Japanese military authorities acknowledged that the Chinese 62nd Division, which had been defending Hangzhou, had resisted in the nearby mountains for over a year. On New Year's Day, they launched a fierce attack with over ten thousand soldiers. According to the Japanese spokesperson, the army surrounded Hangzhou from three sides. Two thousand members of the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps also crossed the Fuchun River north towards Hangzhou, engaging in frequent skirmishes with the Japanese army. Another thousand Chinese soldiers launched an offensive from the northwest of Hangzhou, retreating back into the mountains twenty miles northwest of West Lake. Three thousand soldiers of the 62nd Division suddenly appeared in Xinshi Town (transliteration) near Hangzhou, and another thousand soldiers of the 62nd Division attacked Hangzhou from the Wukang area. The spokesperson concluded that fighting was still ongoing in the northwest of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Launches Three-Pronged Attack on Yuanhua</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Yuanhua Town is an important route for Chinese troops crossing the river from Ningbo and Shaoxing, which has long been resented by the Japanese. Therefore, they resolved to attack Yuanhua Town, burning the entire four-to-five-mile-long market town to ashes. However, deterred by the threat of Chinese guerrillas, they dared not linger and retreated to Haining and other places. On the night of December 21st last year, the Japanese army prepared to attack Yuanhua again, but encountered an ambush by guerrillas at Kuabu Bridge, suffering casualties and retreating midway. On the 6th of this month, a squadron of Japanese aircraft flew to Yuanhua to reconnoiter and planned to bomb the office of the Haining County government, but the bombing resulted in the death of only one dog. Since the formation of the Hiranuma cabinet in Japan, a large number of new Japanese troops have been sent to China, heading to Jiaxing, Haining, Xiashi, and other places to launch a three-pronged attack on Yuanhua from the east, west, and north (the south being Hangzhou Bay). According to the Japanese, this is to achieve the goal of a complete "sweep." All the elite troops mobilized numbered one thousand several hundred, with two aircraft assisting in the battle. The Chinese guerrillas refused to show weakness and rose up to resist. The two sides have been fighting for three days, and the battle situation is unclear, but Japanese troops are constantly moving westward from Xiashi towards Pinglin Temple to attack Yuanhua.</p>
<p>Chinese Army Active Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>Since Xiong Jiandong was ordered by the central government to take charge of the guerrilla warfare in the Wuxi-Shanghai section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the command has become unified, and the fighting has gradually developed. Currently, from the Nanchang area near Shanghai to Kunshan and Suzhou, guerrilla warfare occurs daily along the railway line and between the Qingpu and Kunshan highways. The Japanese army cannot take care of both ends and is exhausted. Many important bridges and intersections on the railway and highways over a long distance from Wuxi to Nanchang have been destroyed. Recently, the engineering demolition team of Xiong's unit once reached Qingyang Port, intending to destroy the large iron bridge, but unfortunately, it was discovered by the Japanese army, and the mission was not completed. Special trains between Beijing and Shanghai and the Zhenjiang-Wuxi section are often delayed, and freight and passenger traffic are reduced. In addition, on the highway front, the public buses run by Japanese merchants are also frequently intercepted by the Chinese army, and business has plummeted. Japanese army vehicles are heavily guarded. According to a fast news agency report from this city, a person from Wuxi said that the regular guerrilla forces there had taken the initiative to launch an offensive against the Japanese army at the beginning of this month. On the 8th, they captured Tangkou and burned down the Japanese military headquarters there. Now, the Chinese guerrillas are advancing towards Zhoujing Port along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The Japanese garrison in the cities of Suzhou and Wuxi has been transferred there in the past few days, and the situation is very tense. In the past two days, trains from Nanjing to Shanghai have carried many Japanese soldiers, who disembarked in Wuxi to be stationed there.</p>
<h3>No Effort Spared in Relief Work for Refugees</h3>
<p>Amateur Performers Stage a Play Today; The Wood Shed in West Shanghai is Completed</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Fundraising Committee of the Amateur Performers Group of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association has been working very actively. Now, initiated by Mr. Zhang Chunbao, a prominent figure in this city, members of the Amateur Performers Group and famous actors and actresses have been invited to participate in a fundraising play, scheduled to be held today at the New Renewal Stage, with two shows, day and night. All proceeds from the ticket sales are the responsibility of Mr. Zhang and will be donated in full. The scheduled program is as follows: Daytime performance: Zai Qijun (Golden Stage), Wu Jiangfeng (Meilong Town), Hua Zhenya, Rong Hongkui, Yang Fengcheng (Pursuing Han Xin), Huang Xiubo, Zhao Peixin, Zhang Zhonghou, Yang Dingxi, Min Juyin, Liu Congxia, Zhang Weiming (Gathering of Heroes, Borrowing the East Wind, Huarong Road); Evening performance: Mao Jiahua (A Club in the Snow), Han Xiaokui (Exploring the Underworld), Miss Shang Huiyuan (Scolding the Palace), Zhang Boming, Cheng Shaoyu (Ancient City Meeting), Lin Shusen (Viewing Paintings and Running Around the City). In addition, the Fundraising Committee of the Amateur Performers Group also announced the fundraising results yesterday: Mr. Chen Jilin's 62nd birthday celebration yielded 4,000 yuan; Mr. Jiang Fuxiang's deceased mother's memorial birthday celebration yielded 2,724 yuan, 1 jiao, and 6 fen; 210 sets of cotton clothing (totaling 440 yuan); another 1,300 yuan was donated by the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, etc. There were also Mr. Tao Guisong's 60th birthday celebration and Mr. Chen Chenglun's son's wedding celebration, etc. The total amount has exceeded 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Wood Shed in West Shanghai Accommodates 10,000 People</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association's construction of a large wooden shed for refugees on Dunxin Road in West Shanghai has been completed. The internal facilities can be described as complete, including schools, medical facilities, playgrounds, etc. Because the well is being built by ourselves, the project is quite large, so it will be completed before the 15th of this month. At that time, the refugees will be moved in, and it can roughly accommodate 9,000 to 10,000 people, becoming a refugee [camp].</p>
<p>Amazing Story of Infants Also Helping Refugees</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fundraising Committee of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association's Food Group received a letter from Liu Zhongquan of Da Shitou Lane in Suzhou City, dated December 29th of last year, which reads: Sirs, I am writing on behalf of my young daughter, Nan Hu, to remit 6 yuan in legal currency through the post office to sponsor one refugee for a period of three months. The motive for the donation is that my young daughter was conceived in August of last year. After the outbreak of the war, she and her mother fled in the womb, experiencing all kinds of dangers and hardships. Fortunately, thanks to Heaven's blessing, the whole family is safe. My young daughter was born this summer, hence the name Nan Hu, to commemorate the bitter scene of the escape. The other day, in the air, we heard your speeches and reports, describing the plight of the refugees, and the whole family, having experienced it personally, burst into tears. The most amazing thing is that our several-month-old daughter cried non-stop and could not be soothed by breastfeeding. Later, I said to my young daughter, "Don't cry, Daddy will remit money tomorrow to save a refugee, okay?" Before I finished speaking, my young daughter stopped crying and turned to smile. For the sake of my beloved daughter and to fulfill the duty of the people, I cannot help but [donate]. I look forward to receiving it and handing it over to the shelter, and I ask you to report it in the air so that enthusiastic people in other places will also donate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Third Branch of the High Court Concerned About Fellow Citizens</p>
<p>All the staff of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, feeling pity for the lives of the refugees in Shanghai, initiated a fundraising campaign for relief, led by President Yang Peng. They raised 70 yuan in national currency, sending half to the Anti-Disaster Committee and half to the Refugee Relief Association to show their concern for the victims.</p>
<p>Educational Facilities of the International Association for Refugees</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai International Relief Association implemented refugee education in its affiliated shelters, it has achieved remarkable results. For example, it has established ordinary primary schools in all its affiliated shelters, and for the sake of relieving unemployed youth with secondary school education, it has established secondary school classes. The teaching methods for adult education focus on production training, which has been very effective since its inception and can serve as a model for implementing refugee education. The number of people receiving education in the association's affiliated shelters is surveyed below: First Shelter, Masnan Road: over 280 refugee children receiving education; Second Shelter, West Aian S Road: over 1,340 refugee children receiving education; Sixth Shelter, North Henan Road: over 250 refugee children receiving education; Secondary School Class, First Shelter: 120 refugee children receiving education. In total, over 2,000 refugee children are receiving education. It is also understood that in all the association's affiliated shelters, regarding adult education, all refugees aged 16 to 45 who have the ability to work must undergo production training and literacy training in stages.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Who Diligently Arrested Thieves Awarded Medals; Approved by the Police Commissioner and Approved by the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>On November 12th of last year, at 7:00 p.m., a Chinese man was riding in a public rickshaw and passing through Zhejiang Road (between Third and Fourth Roads) when he was shot and killed by a gunman. At that time, a Chinese man pointed out the gunman to Chinese Constable No. 1087, who was directing traffic at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road. The Chinese Constable immediately drew his gun and gave chase. Western Patrol Officer Salis Belai witnessed this and also gave chase at the same time. When the two police officers were about ten feet away from the gunman, the gunman suddenly turned around and fired three shots. The police officers returned fire but missed. The gunman continued to flee east along Fourth Road and then turned north to Hubei Road, where Chinese Constable No. 455 shot at him. He tried to return fire, but his bullets ran out, and he was eventually captured by the police officers. Also, on December 1st of last year, at 3:00 p.m., at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hed Road, a member of a certain terrorist group disguised as a vendor fired at Wang Yongkui, who had served in the "Reformed" government, but missed. At this time, Chinese Constable No. 2723 was passing by in a tram and immediately got out of the car, drew his gun, and gave chase. The assassin tried to fire four shots, but the bullets did not fire. He was eventually shot and wounded by the Chinese Constable and fell to the ground, leading to his arrest. The Municipal Council's Medal Committee, considering that Patrol Officer Salis Belai, Chinese Constable No. 1087, and Chinese Constable No. 273, etc., had diligently performed their duties, proposed to award each of them a second-class medal for special police merit. This proposal has been approved by the Police Commissioner and by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Closes the Yangtze River; Openly Refuses Foreigners Entry; Only Missionaries May Be Considered</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports: At a press conference held by the Japanese yesterday (the 11th), a reporter asked when foreign people would be allowed to return to Hankou to resume business. The Japanese army and navy spokesmen replied that they did not welcome foreigners to the ports along the Yangtze River and that the Japanese authorities, for "military reasons," also did not want to see foreigners at the ports and did not want foreigners to travel to and from the Yangtze River. The spokesman also acknowledged that no foreigners had been allowed to return to Hankou, but then said that there were a few exceptions and that representatives of foreign firms had been allowed to travel up the river to Hankou. According to the spokesman for the Japanese embassy, they were planning to grant permission to those applying to return "as much as possible," but he feared that they would not be able to grant every application. The spokesman was unable to announce what conditions must be met to obtain permission, but he said that special consideration would be given to missionaries and that the issue of foreigners returning to the ports along the Yangtze River was not yet under consideration, but that people from third countries would not be particularly welcome in the ports along the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Japan Controls Foreign Exchange in Yantai; Squeezes Out Foreign Banks; Foreign Banks Have Requested Instructions from the Consulate</h3>
<p>Japan is attempting to control the economy and disrupt the finances of North China. In addition to issuing large amounts of counterfeit currency and Japanese military yen, forcing them into circulation among the people, it is also seeking to squeeze out the business of foreign banks. According to confirmation from the foreign banking community in this city, Yantai has decided to implement foreign exchange controls starting on the 15th of this month. The measures are roughly the same as those implemented in Qingdao. This move poses a major threat to foreign banks, and if it intensifies in the future, the business of foreign banks in the occupied areas will inevitably never recover. Therefore, the foreign banking community has reported the details to the consulate for verification in order to respond.</p>
<h3>Famous Tibetan Sacred Felt to Be Exhibited in the United States</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports: Yesterday (the 11th), a Shanghai merchant participating in the San Francisco International Exposition and a member of the Shanghai Enterprise Federation told reporters that the sacred felt of the Dalai Lama of Tibet has been woven with a replica of silk felt and will soon be shipped to the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco. A member of the Enterprise Federation spent many years trying to obtain permission from the highest Lama to replicate the sacred felt. Because Tibetans respect the sacred felt as a god, permission was not granted until a few years ago. A total of ten replicated felts were hand-woven by twenty weavers over a period of one and a half years. Each felt has fifty different colors, and only the most precious Chinese silk can produce such vibrant colors and luster. The final preparations for the exhibition are still underway. According to members of the Federation, the exhibits shipped from Shanghai will be one of the finest exhibits from China participating in the World Exposition. Hundreds of kinds of Chinese-made products will be shipped to the San Francisco Exposition, such as ivory carvings, curios, Gu embroidery, various lacquerware, and linen fabrics from China's famous linen center. The Shanghai Enterprise Federation is an independent enterprise organized by Shanghai merchants participating in the Exposition. According to members of the Enterprise Federation, it has no relationship with the Chinese Agents Association of San Francisco, which is in charge of the participation of overseas Chinese in the Exposition, but the Shanghai merchants participating in the Exposition will use the building built by the Chinese Agents Association, which includes a 150-foot-high pagoda that will be used to exhibit jade.</p>
<h3>Provinces Centralize Finances, Reserve for National Defense, Strive for Frugality, and Increase Revenue</h3>
<p>Our country has been resisting Japan for over a year, and because the war zone is expanding daily, whether in coastal provinces or the heartland of the Central Plains, or even in remote border areas, there is virtually no distinction between the front and the rear. Therefore, the finances of each province are showing wartime characteristics. On the one hand, they are striving for frugality to avoid increasing the suffering of the people, and on the other hand, they are centralizing financial resources to reserve for national defense. Under the central government's overall policy, they are ensuring that local finances are coordinated with central finances so that they do not become fragmented and affect the overall national financial strength. For example, the reorganization of taxes and levies is based on the principle of not increasing the burden on the people and seeking a legitimate increase in revenue. For example, the issuance of public bonds is mainly productive and constructive and seeks to open up rich resources. For example, unnecessary parallel agencies are merged, and unnecessary expenses are stopped, and the budget is tightened. The establishment of public treasuries is being promoted universally. All that is beneficial to wartime finance is being vigorously pursued.</p>
<h3>Military Authorities Issue a General Order to Publicize the Meaning of Military Service to Ensure That Every Household Knows and It Is Deeply Rooted Among the People; Special Offices for Answering Questions About Military Service Are Established</h3>
<p>Military authorities, in order to effectively improve military service, have issued a general order to all provinces to instruct all counties to earnestly publicize the meaning of military service and to establish offices for answering questions about military service. The meaning of military service must be widely publicized by taking advantage of opportunities so that every household knows and it is deeply rooted among the people. At the same time, conscription associations should be quickly established, and all military service affairs in counties, townships, and towns should be handled. Household registers in each township and town, as well as rosters of qualified conscripts, that are incomplete or disorganized must be quickly reorganized. Applications for exemption from military service and the conscription of conscripts must be handled in accordance with the law, and no arbitrary entry or exit or forced conscription is allowed. When conscripts go out, they should strictly follow the procedure of issuing permits, and inspection posts should be set up at the main entrances and exits of cities, towns, and villages to effectively carry out inspection work. Those who go out without a permit should be prevented from leaving and should be required to provide a guarantee not to escape. Townships and towns should encourage the conscripts who evade service and those who commit illegal acts to supervise and report each other in order to eradicate escape and clear up corruption. The existing township and town task forces should be expanded as much as possible within the scope of possibility and given technical training. At the same time, local individuals with patriotic enthusiasm should be identified, trained, and cultivated as cadres. The strengthening of other township and town baojia organizations and the adjustment of personnel should be thoroughly reorganized in order to facilitate the progress of military service.</p>

<h3>Refusal to Open the Yangtze River: Japanese Businesses Dominate Downstream Shipping</h3>
<p>Foreign ships above Shanghai, Chongming, Hutong, and Nanjing are excluded. Guerrilla forces control various locations, allowing for勉強 navigation. After the fall of the Shanghai to Hankou section of the Yangtze River's lower reaches, the Japanese, citing military reasons, refuse to open it, intending to monopolize it. Foreign ships on the Shanghai-Chongming, Shanghai-Hutong, and Nanjing lines are excluded. Fortunately, guerrilla forces control various locations, allowing foreign ships to勉强 operate. The entire shipping industry has severely declined after the war. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Downstream Routes</p>
<p>Yangtze River downstream routes: Shanghai-Hankou section, from Shanghai to Hankou, passing through Nantong, Jiangyin, ports, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Huayang, Jiujiang, Wuxue, Xin'chun, Huangshigang, Huangzhou, etc.; Shanghai-Yangzhou section, from Shanghai to Huojiaqiao, passing through Yaogang, Baigang, Tianshenggang, Xinshenggang, Zhanghuanggang, Xingang, Jiangyin, Liuxu, Taixing, Tianxingqiao, Taipingzhou, Dongxin, ports, Sanjiang, Bajiang, etc.; Shanghai-Qidong section, from Shanghai to Antougang, passing through Chongming Haihonggang Miaogang, Haimen, Songjigang, Niuhonggang, Shujigang, Qinglonggang, Xingang, Qidong, Lingdiangang, Chuanhonggang, Sanhegang, etc.; Shanghai-Chongming section, from Shanghai to Chongming Nanmengang, passing through Qi'aogang, Baozhengang, Xinkaihegang, Ertiaoshuhegang, etc.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships After the War</p>
<p>Foreign shipping companies operating on the Yangtze River routes include British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, as well as state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, private Sanbei, Minsheng, Ning Shao, Dada, Datong, Jufeng, Yuxing, Ping'an, Daxing, Guangxiang, Chongming, Yongyu, and Hexing. After the war, various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River fell one after another. Chinese ships were forced to completely cease operations. Foreign companies still operating, besides British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, included German Hengxi, Haiyi, Lisha, Keithing, Jiangding, Haikang, Lu'an, British McCallie, Christian, Mini, etc. Maller ships, Portuguese Deyao, Avima Li, American Dale, New Dale, Italian Libei and other ships, but only up to the ports. Above Nanjing, the Japanese, citing military relations, refused foreign ships.</p>
<p>Japanese Monopoly</p>
<p>The Japanese aim to monopolize the shipping industry in occupied areas. In addition to prohibiting Chinese ships and illegally confiscating Chinese merchant ships, they also control the operation of inland small ships and obstruct British, American, German, Portuguese, and Italian merchant ships. For example, citing military relations, they refuse to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Despite repeated protests from various countries, the protests were ineffective. At the same time, they are trying to expand the Japanese Nissin Shipping Company's Yangtze River routes. Confiscated Chinese merchant ships are renamed and operated on various routes by the company, such as the Shanghai-Chongming line, Shanghai-Hutong line, and the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Wuhu, and Shanghai-Hankou lines above Zhenjiang, all operated exclusively by Japanese shipping companies. Other foreign ships are not allowed to operate. As for Haimen, Qidong, and Xinshenggang, Hupu, etc., foreign ships are still allowed to navigate because they are under the control of guerrilla forces.</p>
<p>Decline of Shipping</p>
<p>The entry and exit of foreign ships at Shanghai Port after the war: 221 ships entered and exited in August this year, totaling 989,442 tons; 227 ships entered and exited in September, totaling 965,065 tons; 273 ships entered and exited in October, totaling 1,179,653 tons; 260 ships entered and exited in November, totaling 1,147,406 tons. Compared with 1936, it has decreased by more than half. For example, in January of that year, 3,180 ships entered and exited, totaling 2,888,547 tons; in February, 3,375 ships entered and exited, totaling 2,912,554 tons; in March, 3,647 ships entered and exited, totaling 3,186,108 tons.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships are Uniquely Prosperous</p>
<p>During the initial outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese merchant ships almost disappeared due to the impact of the boycott. The Nissin Company was particularly affected. After the fall of Shanghai, Japanese merchant ships gradually recovered and expanded. Since August of last year, they have jumped to the second place among foreign ships. For example, from January to November last year, the UK ranked first among foreign ships with 8,605 ships and 11,372,976 tons; Japan ranked second with 4,908 ships and 5,733,491 tons; Norway ranked third with 817 ships and 1,666,151 tons; Germany ranked fourth with 249 ships and 1,293,044 tons.</p>
<h3>Pudong Circles Commemorate the Fallen Heroes of Nicheng: Memorial Service Scheduled for the 15th of This Month at a Certain Location</h3>
<p>On December 16th last year, the Japanese invaders attacked Pudong. In the Battle of Nicheng, Zhou Qiuping, the captain of the Second Company of the Nanhui Defense Corps, and 27 comrades died in battle. Now, Yu Taosheng, the magistrate of Nanhui County, and people from all walks of life in Pudong's industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military, in order to commend the patriotic heroes, have scheduled a memorial service for the 15th of this month at a certain location. Now, we have found a letter from the Second Company mourning Captain Zhou and the fallen comrades to the friendly forces, which is appended below:</p>
<p>Dear armed comrades of friendly forces in Pudong, on December 14th last year, the Japanese invaders launched an attack on Pudong. In this attack, countless heroes bravely sacrificed themselves to defend the country and protect the local area. Our Captain Zhou and 27 other comrades are part of this glorious sacrifice. They are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and the most determined warriors for national liberation.</p>
<p>The death of Comrade Zhou Qiuping meant that the country lost a most courageous warrior, our Second Company lost a most wise helmsman, and you, the armed comrades of friendly forces, lost a comrade-in-arms who fought against the enemy together. This loss is indelible. Dear armed comrades of friendly forces in Pudong, you did not know the fallen comrades when they were alive, but you know them after their death. Because of their glorious sacrifice and鲜红热血, the connections between you and us are even closer.</p>
<p>More Intimate</p>
<p>Close. We must use the martyrs' blood to unite closely as one and jointly avenge them and fight to the end for the cause of Chinese national liberation. In addition to this belief, we also hope to share our experience in this battle and our attitude with all armed comrades for reference, so as to further cooperate and understand each other. First, we know that in this attack on Pudong, the Japanese invaders used</p>
<p>Vicious Deception</p>
<p>Policies, gathering "citizen meetings" everywhere they went, distributing candy to children, and alienating the relationship between the military and the people. Militarily, they mobilized more than 2,000 people to carry out an "encirclement and suppression," with 500 to 600 people attacking our Second Company alone. Our team had less than 100 members and insufficient weapons. In the contrast between the number of enemies and us and the superiority and inferiority of weapons, we did not suffer a total defeat. Instead, we inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. This proves that only坚决 resistance to the enemy can lead to survival.</p>
<p>Escape is the Road to Destruction</p>
<p>Of the road. The surviving members of our Second Company will continue to carry forward this glorious fighting spirit. Second, we must still go to unite all anti-Japanese forces and fight against Japan together at all costs. To be specific, we will only fight against Japanese imperialism and firmly oppose our own people fighting each other. As long as it is an anti-Japanese army, whether it is a special operations team or a defense corps, we are willing to cooperate closely with them. In the war against Japan, we are willing to</p>
<p>Accept Command</p>
<p>For this belief, our captain was scolded as a "half-baked" because he did not participate in the civil war. Today, we swear again that we are willing to be this "half-baked" who does not participate in the civil war and cooperate closely with all anti-Japanese friendly forces. Dear armed comrades, we will meet at the memorial service. At the memorial service, we will reaffirm our beliefs, hold hands and move forward, so as to mourn our brave队长 Zhou and the fallen comrades. At the same time, we will inform all armed comrades of friendly forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Shanghai Pay Head Tax</h3>
<p>Lacking 200,000, No Solutions in Sight. Some Suggest Female Escorts Should Pay.</p>
<p>The Continental News reports: According to Japanese newspapers yesterday (the 11th), in the next fiscal year starting on April 1st, each taxpayer among the Japanese residents in Shanghai will have to pay a head tax that is higher than that paid by any taxpayer in the six major cities of Japan. Senators of the Japanese Residents Association scheduled a meeting for Tuesday (the 10th) at noon at the Japanese Club on Wenjian Shi Road to discuss ways to raise 200,000 Japanese yen. It is said that if the income in the next fiscal year does not improve, the association is afraid that it will be short of this amount. Therefore, the main topic of the meeting will be how to raise 200,000 yuan when the budget of 1 million yuan is needed. It is estimated that the expenditure for this year will reach 800,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Continental News in Shanghai, the question of "who should pay this new tax" is now attracting the attention of the Japanese authorities and residents. Therefore, there are signs of turmoil in the Japanese community in Hongkou. The Japanese Residents Association is racking its brains to raise the 200,000 Japanese yen that will be lacking in the next fiscal year, but no solution is in sight. The general opinion of Japanese residents is that those who have made extra profits during the war should take on this responsibility, because only they have made a fortune during this Sino-Japanese War. Another group advocates that the 1,500 Japanese female escorts in Hongkou should pay 3 yuan per month to fill part of this funding shortage, because these female escorts have also gained a lot of benefits during the war. It is expected that the association will have a fierce debate on the issue of raising funds to make up for the shortage.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report December of Last Year</h3>
<p>The number of factories in the Public Concession is increasing day by day. The following is a list of the number of large and small factories in the recent three months that have applied to the power company for connection to electricity. The number of large and small factories in the East and North Districts is 120 in October last year, 66 in November, and 80 in December. The number of large and small factories in the West, Central and North Districts is 126 in October last year, 189 in November, and 227 in December. The number of large and small factories on roads outside the West District is 197 in October last year, 150 in November, and 220 in December. The total number of factories is 442 in October last year, 405 in November, and 527 in December. Most of the above-mentioned factories are quite small in scale. The total horsepower of each factory was 4,453.69 in November and 7,494.37 in December.</p>
<p>248 factories newly established in the Concession headquarters have been inspected. These factories employ a total of 8,374 workers. The number and nature of factories in the areas outside the boundary roads and in the East District are still under investigation. The situation at the end of last year will be described in the annual report of last year. The bureau's engineering department has reviewed a total of nine applications for the construction of factory buildings. The most important of the new buildings are a large spinning shed in a yarn factory and a newly established cigarette factory.</p>
<p>(Accidents) A total of 144 industrial and occupational accidents were reported to the Bureau, including 13 fatalities. A total of 14 female workers were injured. The causes of 143 of the accidents have been confirmed. On-site investigations and instructions on the prevention methods to be adopted by the factory have been carried out in 52 cases. Classified by cause, 37 occurred in power-driven machines, 5 occurred in machine shafts, and 11 occurred in belts and pulleys. Classified by industry, the machine hardware industry had the most accidents, with 29 cases. Seven workers died and one female worker was injured in this industry. There were 26 injuries in the transportation industry (one male worker died and two female workers were injured). There were 19 workers injured in the textile industry (including five female workers), and one died. A total of 20 workers were injured in factory fires, of whom 7 died.</p>
<p>(Factory Fires) The most serious incident occurred in a certain hot water plant. An apprentice at the factory was holding a liquid used in the factory at around 4:00 a.m. on December 24. Unexpectedly, a part of it overflowed and fell into an uncovered stove (this liquid can ignite, and its considerable components mix with air, which can explode), thus causing a fire. As a result, two workers were burned to death in the burning factory building, and four people in nearby houses also unfortunately died. The apprentice who caused the accident was burned and died of his injuries afterwards. The factory owner's legal liability for this case is still under investigation. (The Bureau's inspectors found the charcoal stove when they inspected the factory on December 12 and ordered the factory to remove it). Another fire occurred in a waste cotton factory. The staircase of the factory was blocked, so the situation during the fire was very dangerous, but fortunately no workers died. The director of the Bureau's fire department and the staff member of the industrial section have warned the factory owner to clear the cotton lint in the factory building. If there is a fatal incident due to fire in the future, the factory owner will be held legally responsible. Fires often occur in the factory building.</p>
<h3>Rental Disputes in Tongfu Village Scheduled for Mediation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Zone Rental Dispute Mediation Committee approved a letter from lawyer Chen Zhongyin, stating that the party concerned, British Tonghe Co., Ltd., claimed that the rent of the Tongfu Village houses under its management had been repeatedly reduced to 52.1 yuan. Starting from July last year, an agreement was reached with the tenants to have the tenants bear the tap water fee. Water meters were installed in each household. The landlord also reduced the rent by 5% to offset the water fee. At the end of November last year, the tenants were notified that the rent would be increased by 20% starting from January of this year, but the tenant representatives sent a letter rejecting the proposal. Our company does not want to be involved in litigation, so we entrusted Shanghai Special Zone Rental Dispute Mediation Committee to apply for mediation, etc. Therefore, we specially enclose a list of tenants and request to summon representatives from both sides to conduct mediation as soon as possible. After learning about the situation, the committee scheduled a mediation meeting for both parties at 3:00 p.m. on January 14.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Mourns Wang Yiting with a Couplet</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Mr. Wang Yiting, initiated by various circles in Shanghai, has been scheduled to be held at the Lake Society on the 15th of this month. The family members have received many elegiac couplets from important figures of the National Government, such as Kong Xiangxi, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Chen Guofu, Ye Chuqiang, Xu Shiying, etc. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission and President of the Kuomintang, also mourned Mr. Wang with a couplet. The wording is majestic, which reads, "When the wind and rain are fluttering, the strong integrity is more obvious," "Wait until the world is restored, and then mourn this person again." Viewing the couplet, it is enough to show Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Each Vessel's Freight Reduced, Shanghai-Ningbo Freight Continues to Fall, Moufu, Ende and Other Three Vessels Sail to Ningbo Today, Jin-Yong Officially Open to Traffic, and Transportation is More Convenient</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo liner specializing in loading goods originally had Kaibo and Moufu vessels operating. Recently, the Tenth Army Group Headquarters approved four vessels, Ende, Deping, Xin'an Na, and Xinxiang Tai, to speed up to a total of six vessels. Ende and other three vessels are scheduled to sail to Ningbo today, and the freight has been reduced. There is still a tendency for it to continue to decline in the future. The Jin-Yong line opened to traffic on the 10th, making land transportation more convenient. The reporter of the Modern News Agency reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Three Vessels Depart from Shanghai to Ningbo Today</p>
<p>Today, three cargo liners will set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo. China-Italy Company's Ende vessel, after being approved, was originally scheduled to sail yesterday. Due to the congestion of goods, it was changed to sail to Wenzhou this afternoon and then to Ningbo. The Moufu vessel of Lihe Foreign Company, after returning to Shanghai from Ningbo in the morning of the 10th, was originally scheduled to sail yesterday. It was also changed to sail to Wenzhou this morning at 10:00 a.m. and then to Ningbo due to insufficient time for unloading and loading. The Xin'an Na vessel leased by Weilihan Company, after being approved for loading goods, is scheduled to sail directly to Haimen today and then to Ningbo. However, if the procedures are not completed in time, Haimen may be temporarily used as the final destination.</p>
<p>Freight Reduction of Each Vessel</p>
<p>In order to reduce the burden on passengers and facilitate the transportation and sale of local products, China-Italy Shipping Company decided to reduce the freight of Deping and Ende vessels. Today, the freight of various goods loaded on the Ende vessel to Ningbo is calculated at half price. The freight of various goods transported from Ningbo to Shanghai is also reduced accordingly. The company has also reported the freight reduction to the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters for verification. According to a report by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, after the British Kaibo vessel leased by Ning Shao Business Vessel was approved for loading cotton, its freight was also reduced from 3 yuan per package to 1.5 yuan. The freight of Moufu vessel of Lihe Foreign Company sailing to Ningbo to load cocoons has also been reduced from 4 yuan per dan to 2.5 yuan. As for other goods, it is said that the situation will be considered and reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Freight Will Continue to Fall</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency who inquired with relevant parties, due to the reduction of vessels on the shipping routes in eastern Zhejiang after the war, the Shanghai-Ningbo direct shipping ban, the inconvenience of transportation and turnover, and the skyrocketing coal prices and increased costs, the ticket prices and freight rates of each vessel have been consistently increased. At present, the number of cargo liners on the Shanghai-Ningbo line has increased, so in order to reduce the burden on passengers and for business competition, the freight rates have been reduced. There is still a tendency for it to continue to decline in the future. If direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is restored in the future, ticket prices and freight rates may be lowered to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Jin-Yong Line Open to Traffic for More Convenient Transportation</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry in Shanghai, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau is handling water-land combined transportation between Jinhua and Ningbo Hengzhang. The line officially opened on the 10th of this month, making transportation even more convenient. The entire route is 290 kilometers long. The driving time and the Jin-Yong joint ticket price are as follows. The departure time of the vehicles is 8:00 a.m. in Jinhua, 9:40 a.m. in Yongkang, 7:15 a.m. in Ningbo, and 9:45 a.m. in Xikou. One trip is made in each direction every day. In addition to changing cars and ships in Hengzhang and changing cars for lunch in Chang'an, there is no need to change cars separately. The Yu-Yong joint ticket is 11.7 yuan per ticket, Jinhua to Xikou is 10.3 yuan, Yongkang to Ningbo is 9.8 yuan, and Yongkang to Xikou is 8.4 yuan. Military police on the joint transportation vehicles must also purchase full tickets. All free tickets and preferential tickets are not applicable. (The above is a draft from Modern News Agency)</p>
<p>Approval Required for Export of Local Products</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the navigation method in eastern Zhejiang, the Ningbo Garrison Commander requires that the export of domestic local products must be approved before they can be loaded and transported. Now, according to the request of local merchants for accommodation, he specifically telegraphed the higher-level military authorities for instructions. He received a reply stating that he should still abide by the previous orders. All local products for export must still be submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Property Adjustment Office for review. The commander has notified the Yin County Chamber of Commerce and the Steamboat Customs Broker Association. As for the export of goods such as silk and tea, it is still necessary to apply to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications for the sale and settlement of foreign exchange. After obtaining a certificate of foreign exchange purchase, customs declaration and loading on the ship will be approved for export. Food and other items are all prohibited from export.</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures for Passengers Exporting</p>
<p>In order to understand the commercial travelers, the Ningbo Garrison Commander has formulated supplementary measures for passengers exporting, which has been approved by the Tenth Army Group. The original text is as follows: Women and men under the age of sixteen and over the age of forty-five who go to Shanghai or Hong Kong should follow the regulations in the second half of Article 1 of the navigation measures, that is, "Those who are not within this limit must hold a suitable certificate (ID card, or a certificate from a local county government or above) before they can be released. As for civil servants who hold suitable certificates and go to Shanghai or Hong Kong, they can be released. Non-residents and civil servants who export from the area should follow the regulations in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Article 5. Their certificates should be issued by their original county government or above or the dispatching agency. Passengers traveling to and from various places in the area, such as Dinghai, Xiangshan, Shipu, Ninghai, etc., do not need to issue passes, and goods are exempt from restrictions. However, the passengers and goods</p>
<p>Can Take Small Steamships Sailing Within the Area</p>
<p>For passengers and goods traveling to and from neighboring areas in Wenzhou and Taizhou, the regulations in Articles 1, 2, 3 and 6, 7 of Article 5 should be checked. (The above is a draft from New Voice News Agency)</p>

In the afternoon, Major General Glaysett inspected the "D" section of the British defense zone and is scheduled to depart for Tianjin tomorrow (the 13th).</p>
<h3>Fifth Issue of Charity Tickets: Lottery Drawn Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The first, second, and third major prizes of the fifth issue of the French Concession's charity lottery for relieving refugees, all sold in this city, were drawn yesterday (the 12th) at 2 PM at the Canidrome. Besides the lottery monitoring committee members, including Yuan Ludeng, Chasber, Malay Han, Arlinson, and Martin, who were present to oversee the drawing, over 5,000 guests attended, making the event even more lively than before.</p>
<p>At 2 PM sharp, after the monitoring committee members inspected the lottery balls, the drawing began. Half an hour later, the first, second, and third major prizes were drawn one after another. The first prize, number 35770, was sold by Dafulai Ticket Agency on Avenue Edward VII; the second prize, number 37502, was sold by Fulai on Nanjing Road; and the third prize, number 18051, was sold by the Guoxin Bank on Hankou Road. The winners of these major prizes can fully redeem them at the Shanghai Banque de l'Indochine two days later.</p>
<p>It is also understood that the lottery tickets were issued at the same time as the Shanghai Race Club's New Year Sweepstakes, which somewhat affected sales. However, with such results, it was truly unexpected. The sixth issue has already been released today and the drawing is scheduled for February 3rd. It is predicted that this issue will definitely sell out completely.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council: Supervision of Steam Engines: Owners Should Pay Attention: Three Articles of Regulations Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday. The original text is as follows: "For the matter of notice, concerning the rules for installing steam engines and other pressure machines formulated by this Bureau, which have already been published in Notice No. 4677. Factory, hotel, apartment, bathhouse, office, or other building owners installing boilers or other pressure machines are hereby requested to pay attention to the following three articles:</p>
<p>1.  For already installed steam engines, if they have not yet been inspected by an engineer approved by this Bureau, the owner of the machine should promptly employ such an engineer.</p>
<p>2.  For steam engine owners who have already employed an approved engineer to inspect their installed steam engines but have not yet obtained an installation inspection certificate, they should have the inspection work completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>3.  For steam engine owners who have complied with the Bureau's regulations and hold an installation inspection certificate or an annual inspection certificate, they should have their installed steam engines re-inspected in 1939. Any inspection certificate is only valid for twelve months from the date of issue by the approved engineer.</p>
<p>For further information regarding approved engineers or other details of the implementation of these regulations, please contact the Factory Affairs Section, Office No. 602, of the Bureau's General Office. This notice is hereby given for general information."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Explains Doubts Regarding Commercial Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday provided some explanations to trade associations regarding doubts about commercial registration, saying:</p>
<p>According to Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the "Provisional Measures for Commercial Registration in Shanghai Municipality," trade associations have the responsibility to prove, when a member of the trade establishes a new business, that "the member has not used the name of a business already registered by another person for the same type of business." In other words, if the member of the trade uses the name of a business already registered by another person for the same type of business, the trade association can only refuse to provide proof. If the association refuses to provide proof, then the member of the trade cannot register at all. As for corrective measures for stopping the use of the name and compensation for damages, these are all within the jurisdiction of the court and should be handled by the opposing party by appealing to the court according to Article 22 of the Commercial Registration Law.</p>
<p>Adding words to the same brand name cannot be said to be using a registered business name of another person, but it is still a similar business name. Even if the association reluctantly provides proof, it can only prove that the previous business name of a certain trade association has been registered, but one has additions and the other does not, and the scope of proof is limited to this. The decision on whether to approve registration is up to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>If the same brand name is used and neither party has registered, then legally no problems arise that would cause any difficulties for the trade association. If Shop A with the same brand name has already registered, but Shop B was established before and registered later, the trade association can still provide proof based on the proviso of Article 34 of the Implementing Rules of the Commercial Registration Law.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Life Is Not Easy</h3>
<p>Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council Recently Announced: More Than 41% Increase Compared to Before the War</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai worker's cost of living index for December of last year was 154.93 (based on the cost of living in 1926), an increase of 41.8% compared to July of the previous year (the month before the outbreak of the Shanghai War). A comparison of the index for the most recent month with the index for the same period of the previous year is as follows:</p>
<p>| Category | December of Previous Year | December of Last Year |</p>
<p>| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |</p>

<p>The source of rice is abundant, and the customs has not fully allowed the resumption of re-exports, so the price of rice has fallen slightly. The demand for flour is gradually increasing, and the price of wheat has risen, so the average selling price per bag has increased by one national currency unit. Some vegetables have risen in price due to the cold weather. Various cotton textiles are cheaper because the exchange rate has fallen slightly and the production in this city has increased. However, flannel and tweed have increased in price slightly due to winter demand. The price of coal balls has fallen by two or three yuan per ton, and firewood has also fallen in price due to the increasing supply.</p>

<h3>Father and Son, Husband and Wife Face Each Other in Court: Estranged Couple Harmonizes Again: Husband Sues Again for Cohabitation After Separation: Judge Spends Painstaking Efforts to Accomplish a Beautiful Human Relationship</h3>
<p>Tong Wenbin, a native of Ningbo and the owner of Yichang Construction Company, residing at No. 3, Lane 929, Xinzha Road, is 72 years old. He has two sons, the eldest, Tong Zhigu, and the younger, Tong Zhenyuan, both of whom are adults and married. Tong Zhenyuan is skilled in horsemanship and has been working as a jockey at the Jiangwan Racecourse. Sixteen years ago, he married Zhang Guomei (now 31 years old), a woman from Nanxun. They have a son and a daughter. The daughter is already eleven years old, and the son is only four years old. Initially, the relationship between the couple was fairly harmonious, but later, due to Tong Zhenyuan's</p>
<p>Extramarital Affairs</p>
<p>conflicts often arose within the home. Starting in 1936, many incidents occurred, and there were frequent reports to the police due to disputes. In the autumn of that year, Tong Zhenyuan and Zhang Guomei separated. Zhang lived with her father-in-law, Wenbin, while Zhenyuan lived separately at his elder brother Zhigu's residence at No. 24, Haifang Village, Haifang Road. The two sides</p>
<p>Became Like Fire and Water.</p>
<p>Although Ma Xiangsheng and others mediated, it was ineffective. Now, Tong Zhenyuan suddenly hired lawyer Gao Danhua to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Special First District Court, requesting a judgment ordering him to resume cohabitation with Zhang Guomei. The court summoned Zhang Guomei, who hired lawyer Mi Xitong to argue that Zhenyuan was having an affair and presented the fact that Tong had reported to the police on May 15, 1926, at 11 PM that he intended to use a self-prepared pistol to</p>
<p>Put Zhang to Death,</p>
<p>as evidence of Tong's violence, making it difficult to cohabitate with him. She requested that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed. After the court advised them to reconcile outside the court, which was unsuccessful, Judge Xu Fuji opened the Third Civil Court yesterday and summoned Tong Wenbin and Tong Zhigu to testify. According to Tong Wenbin's testimony, he confirmed that his son did indeed hold a gun and intended to shoot his daughter-in-law, and that he himself</p>
<p>Reported to the Police.</p>
<p>His words expressed dissatisfaction with his son's actions, saying that this matter should not have been litigated, but now it has come to the point where I am facing my son and daughter-in-law in court, and the newspapers are reporting it. My mental and reputational suffering is immense. He could not contain his anger. Tong Zhigu then testified that the act of threatening with a gun only took verbal form and that he did not actually take out the gun. He asked the court to persuade the two parties to</p>
<p>Cease the Litigation</p>
<p>and return to his father's house on Xinzha Road to live together, so that the father and son, husband and wife, can reconcile and the family can reunite and share the joy of family life. However, Tong Wenbin firmly stated that he did not want his son to return to the old house. If a reconciliation was desired, they could only live together in Haifang New Village. After Judge Xu repeatedly urged the two parties for a long time, both parties agreed to the court's advice to reunite. However, to prevent Zhang Guomei from relapsing into her old habits and endangering her life, it was decided after a very long period of consultation that Tong Zhenyuan would make a written statement in court that he would absolutely</p>
<p>Turn Over a New Leaf,</p>
<p>and that there would be no more abuse of Zhang, and that he would strictly adhere to monogamy, live with her in Haifang New Village, and that Tong would pay Zhang a total of one hundred yuan per month for living expenses and household expenses. If Tong violated the above regulations, Zhang could still return to her father-in-law's residence. The court made a record of the settlement, which was signed by both parties, and the estranged couple was reunited.</p>
<p>According to the New Tide News Agency, detectives from the Central Police Station of the International Settlement, acting on a tip, seized 15 boxes of counterfeit cigarettes, totaling 750,000 cigarettes, inside the "Tax Bureau" of the "Reformed Government" on Jiujiang Road on the 10th. It is not known how these cigarettes were collected from the mainland by the bureau. However, it is heard that the confiscated cigarettes were produced in the counterfeit cigarette manufacturing facility at No. 921, Wuding Road. In addition to manufacturing cigarettes on a large scale, the facility also has a distribution center in the central district, which is unheard of among counterfeit cigarette manufacturers. It is said that their method of evading taxes is to pack the cigarettes into old boxes of "Great Britain," "Pin Hai," and "Old Knife" brands that have been affixed with tax stamps to show that they have paid unified taxes, thereby facilitating their distribution in the mainland.</p>
<h3>Son Blackmails Father: Interrogation Yesterday: Russian Admits to Extortion: Judge Orders Rescheduling for Retrial</h3>
<p>Peng Juting, a native of Haiyan and the manager of Xinwanyu Sauce Shop at No. 367, Min Ti Ni Yin Road (across from the Slaughterhouse Company, at the Huacheng Road intersection) in the French Concession, residing at No. 1, Hengchang Lane, Beile Road, suddenly received a threatening letter from his eldest son, Peng Jie Kang, on November 30 of last year, extorting two thousand five hundred yuan. On the afternoon of December 1, a Russian named Kanaev (transliteration) and a Chinese man named Zhou Yifeng went to his home, posing as detectives from the French Police, and</p>
<p>Searched for Opium,</p>
<p>extorting 300 yuan in cash. Peng reported this to the French Police, who arrested Peng Jie Kang and sent him to the Special Second District Court for questioning and investigation. The Russian Kanaev and the Chinese Zhou Yifeng, in collusion with Chen Fuming, Wang Fugui, Gao Yunpeng, and Bao Shida in the Public Concession, were also arrested for the same case of searching for cigarettes and blackmailing. They were sent to the Special First District Court for</p>
<p>Legal Action.</p>
<p>The court sentenced Kanaev, Zhou Yifeng, and Chen Fuming to one year and six months of imprisonment each, Wang Fugui and Bao Shida to one year of imprisonment each, and Gao to six months of imprisonment. The French Police transferred the Russian and the six Chinese to custody and sent them to the Special Second District Court for questioning and trial, along with Peng Jie Kang. All details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, presiding Judge Liao of the Special Second District Court came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Yuan Jiahuan, the representative of the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated the case and</p>
<p>Filed a Lawsuit According to the Law.</p>
<p>Kanaev and Zhou Yifeng confessed to posing as detectives and extorting money from Peng's family. Peng Jie Kang only admitted to sending a letter to his father demanding money, but did not admit to instigating the Russian to extort money. Furthermore, the Russian and Zhou confessed that they did not know Peng Jie Kang. The other four, Chen, Wang, Gao, and Bao, did not admit to participating in the extortion at Peng's house. The court reviewed the confessions and decided to reschedule the hearing. The defendants</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Redeployment in Nanshi: Kikuchi Unit Transfers to the Front: Traffic on the Huangpu River Cut Off Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Kikuchi unit of the Japanese army in Nanshi was transferred to the front yesterday. All the 30-odd soldiers handling the closing of the camp are scheduled to withdraw at the end of the month. A large team from Hongkou was dispatched yesterday to take over the defense. At 2 PM yesterday, traffic on the Huangpu River was cut off for two hours due to the Japanese army transporting troops.</p>
<h3>Landlord Forcibly Collecting Rent Unsuccessfully: Blocking Tenants' Doors: Residents of Shuncheng Lane in the Eastern District of Shanghai Refuse to Pay Rent: Hua Yueqiang Stabbed by Japanese Soldiers: Three Arrested</h3>
<p>The houses in the Shuncheng Lane area of Zhoujia Pai Road in Yangshupu are the property of Wang Weiguan, the owner of Delong Tobacco Company, and are managed by the British-owned Ye Guang Real Estate Company. Since the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out two years ago, the area has been a war zone, and residents have fled one after another. After the Japanese army moved west, the houses in Shuncheng Lane were fortunate not to be burned. Recently, some residents have moved in to live there, but Wang Weiguan still entrusted Ye Guang Company to</p>
<p>Collect Rent. Most residents believe that since the area where they live has not been officially opened, they still need a pass to enter and exit, and there is no electricity or running water. According to the current situation, it is difficult to pay rent, so they unanimously refused and sent a letter to the owner requesting the installation of running water and electricity so that they could pay rent. The two sides had disputes over this issue. Unexpectedly, the Ye Guang Company sent many people to block the front and back doors of the residents of the lane on the morning of the previous day, causing public anger. At around 4 PM, a Westerner from Ye Guang Company named Howell, along with three Russian Sige detectives and rent collectors, totaling six people, went to collect rent and were</p>
<p>Rejected by the Crowd. Some people were holding bamboo poles and stones. Seeing the situation was not good, the Westerner hurriedly reported to the Yangshupu Police Station by telephone. A large number of Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives rushed to the scene, but the crowd had already dispersed. Only Hua Yueqiang, a native of Jiangbei, was stabbed by the Japanese Marines with a knife while running away and was captured and taken to the police station, transferred to the hospital. Based on Hua's confession, the police arrested doctors Yu Baoquan, Wang Zhicheng, and Xu Shouhua at No. 2, No. 17, and No. 60, Shuncheng Lane,</p>
<p>And took them to the police station</p>
<p>for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Hua Yueqiang was not present because he was injured in the hospital. The police prosecuted Yu and the other three in accordance with Article 151 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Zhan briefly questioned the Westerner Howell of Ye Guang Real Estate Company and the three defendants, he approved the request of the defendants' lawyers, Huang Xiubo and Li Linzhi, and ordered the three defendants to be released on bail of 150 yuan each. The case was rescheduled to the 19th, pending Hua Yueqiang's recovery from his injuries.</p>
<h3>Selling Counterfeit Cigarettes: Attempting to Escape Through the Roof: Finally Captured by Detectives</h3>
<p>Boatmen Zhang Rongbao and Wang Xiaogui, on the 4th of this month, obtained 16 boxes of Great Britain brand cigarettes from Fan Xiaobao, a native of Ningbo, for the price of 37 yuan, in order to take them back to their hometown to sell. Unexpectedly, after returning home, they learned that the cigarettes were fake. They came to Shanghai yesterday and learned that Fan lived in Room 20 of the Zhonghe Hotel on Fujian Road. So, they visited him at noon. After meeting Fan, they immediately asked to</p>
<p>Return the Goods and Refund the Money.</p>
<p>Fan refused. Zhang and others wanted to call the police, but Fan secretly escaped through the back door. Zhang and others chased after him. Fan escaped into the bedroom of Xu Gu Shi, the landlady of Changchun Longan Shop at No. 157 Fujian Road. At that time, she was alone in the room, and Fan</p>
<p>Locked the Door</p>
<p>and forbade her to make a sound, but Zhang and others had already chased him. People in the store mistakenly thought it was a thief and reported it to the police by telephone. Detective Lang Chengpei and others, wearing iron armor, went to catch the thief. When they rushed into Xu Gu Shi's bedroom, there was no one there. Fan had crossed over from the sun-drying platform into the Juchang Restaurant Hotel on Fuzhou Road. Due to his anxiety, he</p>
<p>Fell from the Glass Canopy</p>
<p>and was captured. At that time, Feng Zhen, a native of Sichuan, stepped forward to interfere and was also arrested by the detectives. They also copied out 40 boxes of fake Old Knife brand cigarettes and two empty Pin Hai boxes from Fan's room in the Zhonghe Hotel and took them to the Old Gate Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and requested detention. The court ordered the detention until the 19th before further questioning.</p>
<h3>Salt Tycoon Commits Numerous Crimes: Investigation Not Yet Completed: The Second Special District Court Interrogates Yesterday: Police Lawyer Requests Rescheduling</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, a well-known salt tycoon and bandit from Anhui, and his eldest, second, and youngest sons, Li Jiaqi, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihua, were in the business of selling smuggled salt in Minhang. When the war broke out last year, Li and others led a life of traitor and spy. After our army moved west, Li and others were not tolerated by the enemy, so they changed to a bandit life, gathered their followers, called themselves the Eleventh Army, and looted in the Caojing area of Songjiang County in southern Shanghai.</p>
<p>Arson and Rape</p>
<p>were committed at will. They kidnapped Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian, wealthy women from the area, forcing Lin to marry his second son, Jiazhou, and She to marry his third son, Bihua. Jiazhou shot and killed Lin's mother and buried her. They committed numerous crimes in the area. In April of last year, the 61st Division of the regular army learned of this, surrounded Li and others and disarmed them. Li and others could not stand firm, so they brought their concubine, Yao, their youngest two sons, their daughter Rongzhen, and Lin and She to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hiding in West Shanghai</p>
<p>at No. 11, Zhongxing New Village, Ciwei Road, behind the Xujiahui Catholic Church, and confined Lin and She in the room, assigning people to guard them day and night, not allowing them freedom of movement. On December 10 of last year, Lin and Yu took the opportunity to escape and went to the Convent of the Holy Mother of the Catholic Church to seek relief. The convent took them in and reported it to the French Police, who arrested Li, his youngest son Bihua, Li's concubine Yao, his eldest daughter-in-law Zeng, his daughter Rongzhen, and suspects Qian Nanhui and Wang Jiachang at dawn on December 12.</p>
<p>All Were Detained.</p>
<p>Li's eldest son Jiaqi and his second son Jiazhou escaped the net. The police sent Li and others to the Special Second District Court for questioning and investigation. Li's concubine Yao, his daughter Rongzhen, his eldest daughter-in-law Zeng, and Qian and Wang were found to be unrelated to the case and were released by the police with the court's approval. Li and his youngest son Bihua were detained pending further investigation. Later, the police arrested Li's second son, Jiazhou, and sent him to the Special Second District Court, requesting his detention and investigation along with Li and others. All details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Liao, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, came to the First Court to order the defendants to be</p>
<p>Brought to Court for Continued Hearing.</p>
<p>The defendants' defense lawyer, Yi Zhendong, also came to court to await instructions. According to lawyer Yuan Jiahuan, the representative of the French Concession Administrative Authority, the police department's investigation of this case is not yet complete, and he requested</p>
<p>An Extension.</p>
<p>The court reviewed the request and did not question the defendants, and ordered a rescheduling for the morning of the 27th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>President of Russian Emigrant Relief Society Attacked: Containing Political Background: The Second Special District Court Orders Further Hearing</h3>
<p>A White Russian named Helinggewei (transliteration), residing at No. 180, Maiyang Road, 36 years old this year, was a soldier during the Tsarist era. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, at around 2 PM, he injured Fan Ming (transliteration), the president of the Russian Emigrant Relief Society, with a brick to the back of his head on Pushi Road. After the case occurred, the French Concession Police ordered detectives to arrest Helinggewei. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court and prosecuted for the crime of injury. The victim, Fan Ming, was a senior staff officer during the Tsarist era, and Helinggewei was his subordinate. Fan Ming believes that Helinggewei's actions have a political background, so he hired lawyer Shen Diguofu to appear in court to assert his legal rights. After Fan Ming himself described the circumstances of the injury, the trial judge Qiu Huan Ying questioned the defendant Helinggewei. The defendant admitted to the attack, saying that the reason for the attack was because the victim, Fan Ming, controlled the Russian Emigrant Relief Society and did not provide relief to poor Russian emigrants. Lawyer Shen Diguofu then stated on behalf of Fan Ming to the court that this case appeared to be an ordinary injury case on the surface, but actually contained a significant political background. The defendants had an organization that attempted to overthrow the victim so that the defendants could move freely, and requested the presiding judge to thoroughly investigate. The court reviewed the words and ordered the defendant to be taken into custody. The case was rescheduled for further questioning after the victim's injuries were examined.</p>
<h3>Russian Drunk Commits Assault: Case Concluded Yesterday: Sentencing Scheduled for the 16th</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Simo, President of the Second Special District Court of this city, was returning to his private residence at No. 6, Lane 79, Huanlong Road in his own car at 2 PM on the 1st of this month. When the car drove into the entrance of the second lane, a Russian named Yiwensinggu (transliteration), who was heavily drunk, was standing in the middle of the road with two friends and would not move. The driver, Yao Rongfu, questioned him, and the Russian attacked him, beating Yao and injuring him. President Wang witnessed this, got out of the car, and questioned him in English. The Russian punched Mr. Wang. The police arrived and took Yiwensinggu into custody. It was found that Yi had previously been arrested for drunk fighting and had been fined 60 yuan by the Special Second District Court. Therefore, he was sent to the Special Second District Court for legal action. Because the victim, Yao Rongfu, was being treated for his injuries in the hospital and was not present, a rescheduling was ordered. All details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huan Ying continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff Yao Rongfu, "At that time, I was driving into the lane, and the defendant was standing in the middle of the road and would not move. When I questioned him, he started to attack me, reaching in through the glass window and hitting me, causing me to be injured." Yiwen Singgu confessed, "At that time, I was blurred due to drunkenness, which caused the incident of assaulting someone. After I sobered up, I knew it was inappropriate and had apologized to President Wang. The President had agreed not to pursue the matter. I request leniency." The court reviewed the confession, announced the end of the debate, and scheduled sentencing for the 16th. The defendant remained in custody.</p>

<h3>Sedimentary Reefs in Eastern Zhejiang: The Ocean is Not Peaceful: Pirates Rob Cargo and Demand Ransom: The Authorities Devise Methods to Suppress Them</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, the ocean area around Sijiao and Shengshan in eastern Zhejiang has recently been rampant with pirates, with extreme intensity. Incidents of robbing cargo ships and kidnapping people for ransom occur from time to time. A merchant, Chen Liangfa, recently bought a boatload of ribbonfish in Shengshan and was robbed by pirates based in Shengsi while sailing through the Da Ji ocean area near Sijiao, who demanded a ransom of 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Numerous Suicide Attempts by Poisoning</h3>
<p>In Room No. 9 of the Zhongxing Hotel on Rue Robert (present-day West Yan'an Road) in Shanghai's western district, a resident named Xu Binghua, aged 30, for reasons unknown, secretly ingested poison yesterday around 9 p.m. A hotel employee discovered him and immediately rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig (present-day Huashan Road) for treatment. However, due to the severity of the poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Xu Qing, a 20-year-old student from Changzhou studying at Junyi Middle School, residing at No. 140 Rue Amiral Bayle (present-day South Shaanxi Road), had recently wished to marry a certain Ms. XX but was opposed by his father, preventing his desire from being fulfilled. The day before yesterday, he harbored thoughts of despair, went alone to the Sanpeng Hotel on Route des Soeurs (present-day Luban Road) in the French Concession, booked Room No. 64, and secretly ingested a large quantity of raw opium, attempting suicide. Only at noon yesterday was he discovered by a hotel employee, who immediately hired a car to send him to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the poisoning was severe, and his life hangs in the balance. It is rumored that his father owns the Jin Tuo Pai (Golden Camel Brand) Fresh Orange Water Factory.</p>
<p>A local woman, Mrs. Chen Zhang, aged 23, residing on Xiamen Road in the International Settlement, had an argument with her husband. Afterwards, she secretly ingested poison, intending to commit suicide. After being discovered by family members, an ambulance was immediately called to send her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The poisoning was extremely severe, and she had already lost consciousness, raising concerns for her life. In a certain room of the Ningshang Hotel on Tianjin Road in the International Settlement, a resident named Mrs. Hong Zhang, aged 24, for reasons unknown, secretly ingested poison.

Living at Zhuanbang, Yidingpan Road, East of the Suzhou Creek, a local male witch (commonly known as a "fairy"), Sheng Aqiu, aged 42, was quite wealthy. He independently operated three Sheng Yongxing rice shops at Zhuanbang, Fahua, and other places on Yidingpan Road. The business was still considered good. The day before yesterday (the 11th), Sheng, carrying 2,000 yuan in legal tender, went with apprentice Lu Jiaguan (aged 20, from Liuhe) to Zhuzhai Town in Shanghai's western district to buy rice. However, when they reached the Baziqiao area, about a mile from the town, several robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, blocked their path, and threatened them with guns, taking all the legal tender on their persons. Before leaving, they also abducted Sheng Aqiu. Yesterday, Lu Jiaguan returned to Shanghai to report the incident. Sheng's family is currently entrusting people to find ways to rescue him.</p>

<h3>Zhou Bangjun's 50th Birthday Celebrated; Celebrities Present Silver Plaque</h3>
<p>Lauding His Virtues with Utmost Respect</p>
<p>Zhou Bangjun, General Manager of the Zhongxi (China-West) Pharmacy, is known for his chivalry, righteousness, and enthusiasm for public welfare, and is highly respected by society. Recently, on the occasion of Zhou's 50th birthday, friends and relatives wished to hold a celebration for him, but Zhou, considering the current difficult times, was unwilling to be extravagant. Yesterday, prominent figures in Shanghai, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, and Chen Tingrui, presented a silver plaque with an inscription praising his virtues. The inscription reads: "Confucius said, 'At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.' At fifty, a person's learning and cultivation are rich, and his actions all follow the will of Heaven, with faith but without blind obedience. However, among the myriad people of the world, few are like this. Mr. Zhou Bangjun of Wujin (Changzhou), examining his life, is close to this ideal. For five generations, his ancestors have been men of letters. His grandfather, Tao Fu, excelled in statecraft and published the 'Three Books of the Zhou Family of Wujin,' which were relied upon as treasures by Lin Zexu and Zeng Guofan. His grandfather, Mengxing, studied under Zeng Guofan and received important responsibilities from Li Hongzhang, but unfortunately died before fulfilling his ambitions. His father was skilled in philology. Therefore, Mr. Zhou inherited the family's academic traditions. Before the age of fifty, his achievements have already been remarkable. Mr. Zhou worried about not being able to continue his ancestors' legacy, believing that virtue is not easily attained. He hoped to base his life on diligent practice, learning to be ashamed, persevering through difficulties, and striving for progress. Reaching fifty and understanding the decrees of Heaven is not accidental. Mr. Zhou believes in the truth of Christianity without blind obedience. This is also true of his career. Initially, following the principles of Fan Zhongyan, he used medicine to help the world. Then, he entered commerce. Later, he served society. Over the decades, he traveled east, west, south, and north, experiencing military, political, commercial, and academic life, enduring hardships but never discouraged. This is not blind faith. He followed Sun Yat-sen in the revolution, serving as the Director of the Medical Department of the Allied Forces Headquarters. In 1912, he participated in Sun Yat-sen's inauguration ceremony as Provisional President. Ultimately, he distanced himself from fame and had no ambition for officialdom, earning Sun Yat-sen's appreciation. Huang Chujiu of Yuyao admired his talent and, in 1923, invited him to be the manager of the Zhongxi Pharmacy. With careful planning, the business grew daily. General Manager Huang deeply appreciated his assistance. In 1930, Huang Chujiu passed away, causing a citywide shock. As a result, the Zhongxi Pharmacy was on the verge of collapse. Mr. Zhou, believing that the gratitude for the recognition could not be forgotten and the responsibility to his colleagues could not be abandoned, acted courageously and selflessly, shouldering the responsibility alone. He used all his wisdom and ability, publicly raised funds, and finally saved the company, becoming the general manager. Over the past seven years, the pharmacy has become one of the most prominent in Shanghai. Mr. Zhou sees radio broadcasting as the best and fastest modern educational tool and established the Zhongxi Radio Broadcasting Station. Many followed, contributing greatly to society. Mr. Zhou serves society tirelessly, benefiting others and working hard. As a result, he was recommended by society to serve as a supervisor of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, vice president of the Commercial Night School, standing committee member of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Federation, chairman of the Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association, and member of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement. Other public organizations and schools competed to enlist him as a pillar. The method of adopting refugees by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association City Foot Group Fundraising Committee was conceived by Mr. Zhou. The whole city followed, yielding great results. Most admirable is that Mr. Zhou, following his mother's wishes, donated 2,000 yuan of funeral expenses to the Tongde Hospital Scholarship Fund. Qiaqing and others believe that Mr. Zhou is a pillar of society, advancing in age and understanding the decrees of Heaven. We wished to hold a celebration for him, but Mr. Zhou said generously, 'Although I am fifty, my career is still in its infancy. The world situation is turbulent, and there are countless refugees waiting to be fed. I do not wish to trouble relatives and friends for my personal celebration. Therefore, for weddings and funerals, we gather as a group, and when a grandson is born, we do not distribute eggs, following Confucius's intention of frugality.' Qiaqing and others could not refuse, so we record his actions and remember him."</p>
<h3>Lost Girl Sought</h3>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read an article in your newspaper on January 10th entitled "Unemployed and Unable to Make a Living, Hangs Himself." The article stated that Mr. Xu Zhaolu had been working at the Fufengxiang Money Exchange established by his uncle, Wu Qishou, but was recently dismissed by his uncle, leaving him unemployed and unable to support his elderly mother, wife, and children, leading him to take his own life by hanging himself on the morning of the 7th. This is not in accordance with the facts. I, Wu Qishou, took in my nephew Xu Zhaolu because of difficult family circumstances after the death of his biological father. He entered the Fuhexing Money Exchange I established to learn the trade. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked in the shop for nineteen years and had considerable savings. He asked my brother to come and inform me that he was resigning to open a department store with his relatives in the city. Due to the war, the loans he had extended could not be recovered, and due to the difficulty of living in the concession, his biological mother requested at the beginning of last summer that he return to my shop to temporarily assist in the care. After several months, his mother and brother came again to request his resignation on his behalf. I tried to dissuade him from leaving, but to no avail. Who knew that just over a month after resigning, I heard the news of his suicide, which I deeply regret. According to my information, Mr. Xu was only thirty-five years old and was not married. How could he have a wife and children? The cause of his suicide was not due to my dismissing him. The facts are as stated. The original news was incorrect. Please correct it in your newspaper as soon as possible to rectify the misunderstanding. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wu Qishou of Fuhexing Money Exchange, January 12th, 28th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1939].</p>

<h3>Financial Powerhouses Spare No Expense to Acquire Cash; Another 2,000 Yuan Exceeds Barrier; Central-English Pure Gold Falls Back; Unaffected</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash speculation market continued to rise, breaking through the 2,000 yuan barrier, mainly due to the continued softening of foreign exchange rates and the vigorous absorption by a certain money exchange acting on behalf of wealthy individuals in the city. In addition, the silver shop's willingness to supply has weakened, causing a temporary shortage of circulating chips on the market. However, midway through, the tight situation eased slightly after foreign exchange was blocked by foreign telegrams and Western merchants, causing the market price to fall slightly. However, the result was a further increase of nine yuan. Throughout the day, the rise and fall were sudden, with the overall trend fluctuating outside the 2,000 yuan barrier. Sentiment was firm but slightly apprehensive, with active trading throughout the day. Jewelry gold also rose twice. Customs gold and Central-English pure gold both decreased.</p>
<p>Speculation Sentiment Towards Prosperity</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (ten liang, equivalent to 37.5 grams) opened high due to reports of a soft foreign exchange rate, which boosted speculation sentiment. Buyers were quite active, and a certain money exchange was particularly eager to buy on behalf of wealthy individuals, pushing the opening price up to 2,000 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange bought 50 taels of cash, followed shortly after by another gold shop buying 50 taels at the same price of 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm bought another 50 taels from a gold shop, also at a price of 2,000 yuan. Soon after, it resold 50 taels back to a certain money exchange at the original price. Afterwards, the appetite of a certain money exchange grew stronger, and the foreign exchange rate gradually tightened, causing a surge in buying interest, pushing the price up several yuan. A money exchange bought 30 taels of cash at a price of 2,001 yuan. Another money exchange bought 50 taels from a gold shop at a price of 2,002 yuan. The money exchange and gold shop transacted 50 taels with each other at a price of 2,003 yuan. Subsequently, sellers became increasingly scarce. A money exchange bought 10 taels from a silver shop at a price that jumped to 2,006 yuan. Later, money exchanges transacted 20 taels with each other at a price of 2,004 yuan. A silver shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at a price of 2,006 yuan. Money exchanges transacted 50 taels with each other at a price of 2,005 yuan. Afterwards, the price once stabilized, but the wind of rising was suppressed once again due to the step-by-step recovery of foreign exchange rates. The gold shop sold 50 taels to the silver shop at a price of 2,000 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon, it was reported that the foreign exchange rate first loosened and then tightened, and a certain gold shop and money exchange rushed to search for gold, but most sellers remained on the sidelines. It was not until about 2:00 p.m. that the gold shop bought 50 taels from the money exchange at a price of 2,006 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange bought another 50 taels from a gold shop at a peak price of 2,008 yuan. Later, money exchanges again transacted 30 taels with each other at a price of 2,007 yuan. At 3:15, money exchanges again transacted 50 taels with each other at a price of 2,005 yuan for the closing price, up nine yuan from the previous day. The cumulative increase over four consecutive days totaled twenty yuan. The selling price of cash gold from this shop was 2,015 yuan, and the buying price was 2,020 yuan. The current price of the standard gold is 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no open trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises Twice</p>
<p>The initial selling price of silver jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. However, at 10:00 a.m., seeing that speculation sentiment was also high, it also increased by one yuan. At 2:45 p.m., it increased by another yuan. Datongxing and Lao Qingyun revised the listed price to 204 yuan, Xin Tongxing to 202 yuan, and the buying price to 196 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Drops Again</p>
<p>On the 11th, the London telegraph reported that English pure gold fell back again. This was because the sterling exchange rate had increased the previous day, causing each ounce to also fall back by two shillings, reaching nearly seven pounds, eight shillings, and ten pence. The Central Bank's Chinese pure gold speculation buying price also retreated to 1,215 yuan. The listed Customs gold also fell by two li, totaling 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 1.3 yuan, totaling 1,210 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Double Buying Trend in Foreign Exchange: Settlement with Foreign Firms Using Foreign Currency Flourishes; Japanese Merchants Also Engaging in Secret Activities</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market is experiencing continuous tightening pressure due to the increasing use of foreign currency for settlement by foreign firms, competition among Chinese speculators, and secret manipulative activities by Japanese merchants. However, temporary relief was provided by foreign news reports and aggressive selling by Western merchants like Sassoon. Ultimately, demand exceeded supply, making it unsustainable, and trading volume remained high throughout the day.</p>
<p>Morning trading started with no changes in the London large bills and New York silver prices. London spot gold decreased by two pence, the exchange rate of British pounds to US dollars decreased by 3.7 cents, British pounds to French francs remained unchanged, and British pounds to Shanghai dollars also remained unchanged. US dollars to British pounds decreased by 0.0625, US dollars to French francs decreased by 0.1875, and US dollars to Shanghai dollars decreased by five cents. The central government's official exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened early, with the spot selling price of British pounds at 8.421875 pence and US dollars at 16.375 yuan, compared to the previous closing price, with British pounds unchanged and US dollars decreasing by 0.03125. Although foreign news reports provided a significant influx of supply after opening, banks were happy to absorb it at a low price, so there were no changes. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rate and the silver equalization tax announcement also remained unchanged. Subsequently, due to the increasing volume of foreign currency settlements by foreign firms and reports of secret purchases by Japanese banks, coupled with banks' unwillingness to sell cheaply, the situation immediately tightened. British pounds softened to a settlement rate of only 8.3125 pence, and US dollars to 16.35 yuan. Although Hong Kong dollars were sold off by money changers, the price also softened to 56.25 yuan. Near noon, it was reported that Sassoon sold US dollars at 16.2835 yuan, but it was quickly difficult to sell. Foreign news reports also sold again, providing a slight rebound. The afternoon closing price for British pounds was a few pence at 8.375, and US dollars at 16.28125.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, speculation by cotton yarn dealers, Chinese speculators, and foreign firms remained unabated, and the supply of funds from banks remained insufficient, leading to a renewed softening trend. The tightest price for US dollars softened to 16.21875 yuan. Afterward, Western merchants like Sassoon and foreign Hong Kong telegraphs competed to sell aggressively, and money changers also sold tirelessly. Furthermore, the banks' appetite for buying suddenly became difficult, causing the situation to stabilize slightly. British pounds and US dollars rebounded to 8.4375 pence. However, Sassoon soon sold US dollars again at 16.218125 yuan, and it was difficult to sell. There were also Hong Kong telegraphs selling British pounds at 8.390625 pence, and Hong Kong dollars rebounded from 56.125 yuan to 56.25 yuan. The evening closing prices for the banks' selling rates were British pounds at 8.375 pence and US dollars at 16.12875 yuan, resulting in British pounds decreasing by 0.046875 and US dollars softening by 0.1875 compared to the previous close, while Hong Kong dollars tightened by 0.125. A record of the day's trading is listed below:</p>

<p>Securities Speculators Spread Rumors of Government Bonds Rebounding; Transactions for "96" Bonds Actually Occurred; Foreign Debt Market Quite Stable</p>
<p>The securities market experienced a decline yesterday. The rumor that interest on government bonds would be paid by Chongqing was disproven by the rebound in market prices. From this, it can be inferred that the sharp decline the day before was entirely due to the outflow of physical bonds and was exploited by speculators. It also shows that people are still optimistic because the previous surge made it difficult for bulls to act. They seized the opportunity of the outflow of physical bonds to spread rumors and suppress prices, in order to fulfill their desire to buy at low prices. These smoke-and-mirrors tactics were quite capable of deceiving people for a while, and there must have been many who were fooled. Therefore, when trading opened yesterday morning, only Class B bonds remained weak, because bulls took the opportunity to unload them, thinking they had made a profit, as the drop the day before was the smallest for these bonds. All other types gradually became firmer. The process initially involved retail investors buying, followed by sporadic absorption by money houses. Then, the "Tiansheng" firm released a large amount, causing a slight setback. Finally, "Dafeng" firm and retail investors resumed buying, leading to a rise. Thus, by noon, except for Class B bonds, which were down by a small five and a half cents, the rest had recovered by one to three cents. In the afternoon, confidence strengthened, and buying interest intensified. First, the 13th firm bought actively, followed by retail investors, and the rising trend gradually gained momentum. All bonds rebounded by four to six cents, and the trend showed signs of a turnaround. The "96" bonds, which had been inactive for many days, suddenly saw bullish buying by the 11th and 14th firms, raising the price by three cents and gradually showing signs of life. As a result, all bonds uniformly rebounded by one to seven and a half cents. The total trading volume was over 800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Slight trading in stocks. Some of the previously offered stocks have been traded. Two transactions of China Firecracker Company stocks were made the day before, with 600 shares traded at a price of 12.5 yuan in legal tender settlement. Yesterday, 100 shares were traded at 13.75 yuan in exchange settlement. 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded at 21.5 yuan in exchange settlement. No other agreements have been reached.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt Listed This Month on the 11th (Wednesday). Only the British-issued bonds for the British Gold Rehabilitation Loan rose by one pound, to a price of 53 pounds. (Note: Yesterday's report that British-issued bonds for the British-French loan fell by three pounds was actually a typographical error for the British-issued bonds for the British Gold Rehabilitation Loan falling by two pounds. The market price for British-issued bonds for the British-French loan remained at the original price of 55 pounds. This correction is hereby made.) Regarding physical supply, today there are 5,000 pounds of French-issued bonds for the British Gold Rehabilitation Loan being sold for 49.5 pounds, half a pound higher than the previous market price. 5,000 pounds of Hubei-Guangdong Railway Loan bonds issued by non-German entities are being sold for 13 pounds and 15 shillings, 15 shillings higher than the market price. Another 5,000 pounds of German-issued bonds are being sold for 21 pounds and 5 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the market price. Loan bonds for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway completed in 1936 are being sold for 24.5 pounds. (Note: 5,000 pounds of these bonds were also offered for sale two months ago, with an asking price of 35 pounds and 5 shillings.) However, there is currently demand for British-issued bonds for the British Gold Rehabilitation Loan, with an offer price of 46 pounds and 5 shillings.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Reactivated; Refined Cotton Sugar Raised to 16 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, as determined by the guild, showed a flat trend. Grade 24 coarse white sugar and Taikoo refined military white sugar were traded at the original price. There were no changes in the market, but domestic sugar became more active. There were rumors of continued price increases. 125 packages of Chaozhou Mingcheng refined cotton sugar were opened at 16 yuan, an increase of six to seven cents compared to the previous price. Over 300 packages of refined cotton sugar from the same traders were offered at 15.6 yuan. Over a hundred packages of ordinary Shantou red sugar were called for at prices ranging from 14.4 yuan to 13.89 yuan, and some at 12.5 yuan. Old Chaozhou Qing Chong from the Ti Zhuang was at 12.5 yuan, ordinary sugar at 11.8 yuan, with over 1,000 packages still available. A few dozen packages of Qi white sugar were at 18 yuan. Jian traders offered over 300 packages of superior Diaoging at 10.5 yuan, and over 300 packages of Zhangzhou red sugar at 11.9 yuan. A few dozen packages of Quanzhou white sugar were at 21.7 yuan. Guangdong traders offered over 200 boxes of high-grade Qing slices at 11.5 yuan, and over 200 pieces of Hainan red sugar at 12.2 yuan. As for exports, 60 packages of sugar were shipped to Xingang and another 6,500 packages were shipped to Ningbo today.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Sichuan Fungus Reaches 240 Yuan</p>
<p>Black fungus is becoming increasingly scarce in stock due to active demand from Shantou, Fujian, and Hong Kong traders. However, suppliers are asking for very high prices due to limited sources. Therefore, Sichuan fungus initially opened at 220 yuan and rose again to 226 yuan yesterday. One firm, seeing the tight market situation, held back and is now asking 240 yuan. Given the thin stock, this price is indeed possible. Hankou miscellaneous fungus opened at over 205 yuan and is also being called for at higher prices, but the market is relatively flat. As costs rise, prices are bound to increase gradually.</p>
<h3>Large Bills Remain Flat; Indian Silver Decreases</h3>
<p>London, 11th: The silver market is calm with little change. The market remained flat after closing. Sellers are selling at the listed price, but buyers require a discount of 0.0625 to be interested. Large silver bills for near and far terms remained unchanged. New York: The price of American silver remains the same, with market activity lacking. Bombay: The Indian silver market is slightly volatile with a slight shakiness. Spot and near/far terms all decreased by one anna.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Rise Again; Remittances Return to 30 Yuan Outside the Customs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange-settled notes continued to rise, with the discount rate per thousand yuan returning to the 30 yuan mark. Initially, it was flat in the morning, remaining at around 29.5 yuan. But as demand swarmed in, it immediately jumped to 32 yuan. The final price was 31.75 yuan, 2.25 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by two pence, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. Foreign exchange was tight due to weak supply of foreign telegraphs, exceptionally high settlement by foreign firms, and strong absorption by banks and speculators. In the afternoon, settlement slowed slightly, and banks slightly sold out, causing the market price to ease slightly. US dollars were slightly weaker than the previous night, and British pounds were even weaker. Guangdong traders vigorously searched for Chixia, and retail investors also added to their absorption. Supply was weak, and market prices rose slowly, breaking the 2,000 yuan mark again. In this wartime period, there is an abundance of floating capital, and Chixia trading is difficult to fall and easy to rise. Demand for foreign currency remains strong, and affected by weak foreign exchange and high Chixia prices, most currencies rose sharply, showing a strong trend. Guild transactions were very rare, with only Tongfeng sending Hong Kong bills to Rentai for 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 0.2 yuan, British gold bills rose by 0.2 yuan, US dollar pounds rose by 0.2 yuan, US dollar bills rose by 0.045 yuan, Hong Kong bills rose by 0.008 yuan, Dutch bills rose by 0.015 yuan, Canadian bills rose by 0.05 yuan, Philippine bills rose by 0.01 yuan. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Continuous Sales of White Cloth; Extremely Strong Demand for Colored Cloth from Guest Traders; Urgent Replenishment of Eastern Piece Goods Gray Fabric</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Sales of domestic white cloth continue uninterrupted. Yesterday, as the yarn market rebounded and sentiment strengthened, small quantities of fine cloth and fine twill were sold at slightly lower prices, one or two cents cheaper than the market price. However, most people believe that after the huge volume of goods sold the week before, there would soon be a return of business. At that time, with the Shanghai stock depleted, market prices were expected to trend upward, so their intentions were very firm. Factory prices were visibly high. The coarse cloth market turned upward, with the greatest demand for 10-pound cloth. Xinyu Earth coarse cloth was sold open at an increased price of 0.25 yuan per piece, with the remaining goods up by 0.05 yuan. Sales of gray fabric to the local dyeing industry were the most active. Most of them were for delivering fixed-amount spot goods. Fine twill transactions also reached over 100 packages. Hong Kong traders slightly increased their orders for white cloth, with transactions for 80 pieces of fine twill, coarse twill, and coarse cloth. Demand for colored cloth and colored twill was extremely strong. Shantou and Quanzhou traders vigorously searched for goods, with transactions for over 300 boxes. The Ningbo and Ou traders also mainly purchased colored cloth and colored twill, buying a total of over 200 boxes. Demand from Jinhua and Guangfeng along the Zhejiang and Jiangxi lines was also urgent. The local wholesalers handled various factories' white cloth, colored cloth, blue cloth, colored twill, Yuanfang silk, and Western satin from factories such as Lunchang, Shenxin, and Yong'an, totaling several thousand pieces. Over 2,000 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill were handled for Subei, Wuxi, and Changzhou. Local demand was visibly large, and dyeing factories were unable to supply enough. Market prices turned upward after falling.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Rebounded by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, due to the tight market and empty inventory. The local dyeing industry continued to sell colored cloth and colored twill well, so the replenishment of gray fabric was still urgent. Yesterday, transactions reached about 1,000 pieces. Wholesale traders in the local area actively purchased inner and outer factory Sijunzi and Zhigong Serge, with transactions of over 100 boxes. There was a lack of spot goods, and prices were also firm. Shanghai factory various grades of coarse cloth and inner and outer printed goods were also actively traded in the local area.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Today's piece goods exports included 220 pieces shipped to Ningbo, 370 pieces shipped to Shantou, 50 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 70 pieces shipped to Haikou, and 345 pieces shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Wheat Bran Suddenly Rises; Drastic Changes; Export Inquiries Create Rising Trend</h3>
<p>After a period of softening, the wheat bran market saw continued inquiries from export traders yesterday. The morning opened with a lively atmosphere. Da Bao wheat bran from Fufeng Factory jumped from 2.95 yuan (exchange settlement price) on the previous day to 3 yuan. Afterward, it gradually strengthened, with strong buying interest. Speculators competed to buy, causing a drastic rising trend in an instant. The afternoon transaction price reached 3.1 yuan (cash). As a result, the closing price was 3.15 yuan, with the total trading volume estimated at over 30,000 packages.</p>
<p>Today, 300 packages of wheat bran are being shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<p>Regarding bean exports, 700 packages of beans were shipped to Shantou and 1,500 packages were shipped to Hong Kong today. In addition, 4,770 pieces of bean cakes and 320 packages of raw peanuts were all shipped to Shantou today.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: New Guangdong Peels Are Arriving Soon</h3>
<p>Xinhui peels once sold for a maximum price of 140 yuan per dan due to a shortage of goods. Later, as goods gradually arrived, the price gradually softened, falling to 100 yuan. Recently, reports from the producing areas stated that the output of new goods was very abundant, and a large quantity would be shipped to Shanghai soon. As a result, prices fell again. Yesterday, a certain firm sold high-grade goods for 90 to 85 yuan. If sales remain sluggish, prices are expected to continue to fall.</p>
<h3>Marine Products: Pure White Fish Skin Is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Among the fish skin category, white fish skin is made by manually removing the outer sand from the raw material, resulting in a pure white color and slightly transparent appearance. It can be cooked after soaking in water, which is a simpler process, so chefs are happy to use it. Both local and guest traders are purchasing, but recently the supply has been limited while sales have been active, resulting in a relatively favorable trend. The price is selling for 160 to 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Arriving by Train Is More Abundant</h3>
<p>Jing Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 10,000 packages arrived at He Xia No. 5 by train, further dampening sentiment. Local traders were still watching and waiting, with speculators buying less and selling more. The route for Baozi was moving slowly. Trading volume for various goods was limited, and the market went downhill again. Thick and thin Jing rice fell by several cents to 0.1 yuan. Duyangjian, Bujiantian, and Yinbianyuan all softened by nearly 0.1 yuan. However, the evening market trend seemed more stable, because the owners were willing to wait for an opportunity to sell again due to cost considerations.</p>
<p>Guest Xian</p>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals were more abundant, but digestion was slow. A few guest speculators were also looking to sell, and the transaction volume was less than 1,000 packages. Therefore, the market continued to decline. Although Gao Wuxian rushed Nanjingxian was opened at 10.05 yuan, ordinary high-grade goods were already down to around 10 yuan. High-grade Nanjingxian arrivals were scarce, and the medium grade also fell by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Order Over 50,000 Packages of Foreign Flour; Price Is Only 4.5 Yuan Cash; Already Comparable to the Selling Price of Shanghai Flour</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market remained stable. In recent days, retail sales to guest traders were still not weak, because the Lunar New Year was approaching, and demand for New Year goods was gradually being activated. However, the factory's current production is not abundant, and there is no large quantity available for supply. Therefore, the market can only manage to get by with small-scale trading. The selling price is also difficult to rise or fall. As a result, about 30,000 packages of Cannon, Battleship, and Tianzhu No. 2 were traded at the original price, and 20,000 packages were jointly handled by traders from both the North and South. Local retail accounted for 8,000 packages. The factory price was still called for at 4.9 yuan. Byproduct flour was scarce and without a market. Today, 3,500 packages of flour are being shipped to Xingang, 300 packages to Ningbo, and 1,250 packages to Shantou.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market also lacked special features. The source of train arrivals was estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 packages. The goods arriving were mainly wheat from Puzhen and Chuzhou in Jiangbei. The factories' appetite for goods increased compared to before, because the previously ordered foreign wheat had not yet arrived, and the demand for domestic wheat was visible. A total of 10,000 packages of various wheat types were traded, still handled equally by the Fuxin and Fufeng factories. The highest price was 6.7 yuan, with slight differences in spot goods. It was also reported that 1,000 packages of wheat arrived from Xingang yesterday.</p>
<p>Another Report</p>
<p>Since the coastal ports fell into war zones one after another after the war, the source and transportation of grain have been quite difficult due to various factors. As a result, foreign flour and wheat took the opportunity to invade and dump. In recent days, foreign merchants have been promoting foreign flour at low prices, which has adapted to the needs of local grain merchants. It is reported that grain merchants such as [names omitted] have newly ordered a total of over 50,000 packages of American foreign flour, with a price of only 4.5 yuan (cash). After adding unified taxes and miscellaneous fees, it is equal to the selling price of Shen flour. It is said that the flour is expected to arrive in Shanghai after the 20th of next month.</p>
<h3>Metals: Only Huis Company Iron Is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Metal trading has been very sluggish recently. In the recent tightening of foreign exchange, the market has managed to hold steady without falling. Only the 200-pound Huis Company iron was actively traded, with traders from Tianjin and Fuzhou competing to purchase it. Local factories also added some embellishments. The market situation was extremely good, and few new goods had arrived. Inventory was thin, so the market price became even firmer. Each box jumped from 52.7 yuan to 54 yuan, and the asking price in the market had reached 55 yuan. It was found that 400 to 500 boxes were traded yesterday, sold by metal stores along North Suzhou Road. Judging from the situation in the future market, it is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Chinese Cotton Prices Deemed Too High; Foreign Cotton Enters Directly; Set to Surpass; Over 10,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton Imported</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The American cotton market was firm because there were fewer spot coupons and various domestic textile mills feared that the grades of American cotton they desired would be used as collateral by farmers for import loans. Therefore, various domestic mills still had a large number of transactions in recent days. However, the amount of exports abroad did not increase sharply. Yesterday, the cotton market was firm. Indian traders bought distant-term cotton for October and December in New York, and various spot traders also bought. As a result, prices rose by 3 to 6 pounds. Distant-term prices rose by more than 10 pounds. The Indian cotton market was very stable, rising by 0.25 rupees. Egyptian cotton had been falling for several days, but it rebounded by more than 30 pounds yesterday. Yesterday, as the exchange rate softened, the legal tender cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by over 0.4 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 2.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Local foreign cotton trading: Indian cotton is still strong. Pingguoer cotton is already 11 yuan cheaper per dan than Huoji cotton, and 20-count Bairuo cotton is also 2 yuan cheaper than Tongzhou cotton. Various factories have already placed large orders for Indian cotton. In recent days, factories have been buying Huoji Yao flower out of urgent need. According to the current trend, domestic cotton may be cut off after February and March. A large batch of Indian cotton was imported yesterday, totaling 11,875 pieces, shipped from Karachi, India. Among them, 2,775 pieces were purchased by the British firm Fojia, and the rest were purchased by Japanese merchants. The transaction volume and spot prices are listed separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Yesterday's transaction volume: Shenxin imported 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, and imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton. Shanghai imported 1,000 bales of Indian cotton. Gongda [imported] 1,000 bales. NeiWai [imported] another 1,000 bales. Tongxing [imported] another 500 bales. Yufeng [imported] another 1,000 bales. Donghua [imported] another 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign cotton exchange market prices are listed on the left: Raw Material Category, Dock Delivery, excluding tax 60-count Egyptian Cotton, Superior Grade 102.15; Medium Grade 99.30; 80-count, Superior Grade 120.80; Medium Grade 113.10; 20-count American Meterlin, 76.75; Lower Grade 65.5; 32-count, 86.15; Lower Grade 74.35; 42-count, 87.85; Lower Grade 75.55; South American Brazilian Cotton, Superior Grade 81.20; Medium Grade 77.15; Lower Grade 70.65; 50-count Indian Pingguoer 54.85; 56-count 59.20; 20-count Indian Oumola 63.15; 20-count 66.40; 32-count Indian Bairuo 74.00; 33-count 42-count American Pengjiapu 87.40.</p>
<p>Domestic cotton business is particularly cold and Qing (clear/sparse), because various factories recently ordered too much foreign cotton, and they are arriving in Shanghai successively and are becoming crowded. Factory demand has a surplus, and Chinese cotton prices are high and not softening, while foreign cotton market prices remain flat. Therefore, manufacturers are all holding a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to purchase unless it is an urgent need. As a result, trading has almost come to a standstill. Since the start of the Hong Pan, Japanese factories have purchased very little Chinese cotton. The Indian Pingguoer coarse velvet cotton purchased by the Shenxin Factory today can replace Huoji flower and Yaohua, and the price is only 58.5 yuan in cash, and it can be delivered to the factory. However, the color is relatively dark. The source from Subei is still smooth, with 1,791 bales of Tongzhou cotton flower, 340 pieces from Beisha, and 350 pieces from Xingang. Today, it was reported that 40 pieces of cotton flower were shipped to Shantou. The transaction volume of spot cotton and the market price are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn Industry Buys Warehouse Receipts; Cotton Yarn Decline Temporarily Stabilized; Rumors of Controlled Exchange in Yantai; Japanese Yarn Shipment to North Not Cost-Effective</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable and quiet, and the trend has turned to rising again, because since falling for two consecutive days, 20-count Shuangma has fallen from its peak (yesterday's low price saw 382 yuan) by 21 yuan. Public opinion believes that the recent financial situation is looser, the actual demand is not bad, factory inventory has decreased, and cotton yarn itself is relatively consolidated. Therefore, traders have turned from stillness to action, suddenly buying warehouse receipt goods. At the same time, although there is no large-scale development in the eastern part of Zhejiang and the southern part of China, retail purchases continue uninterrupted. As a result, sentiment is good, and the market has turned from weak to strong.</p>
<p>It was found that yesterday's market situation: the opening in the morning carried on the remaining momentum of the large-scale buying by major traders the day before, the market was stable, and the floating traders did not show any signs of urgent selling, so the opening price increased by 1 yuan, and someone came to buy. Then, [names omitted] all came to drag in warehouse receipts, tightening further and rising slowly. The final price for Shuangma was 389 yuan. However, the actual need has not shown much improvement, so it is not perfect. The statistics of transactions in the morning totaled 1,015 packages. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 5 yuan, the price of Tejincheng rose by 9 yuan, the price of Tiannv rose by 4 yuan, and the price of Muyang did not fluctuate much. The factory opened 50 packages of 20-count Tejincheng from the Yong'an Factory, with a price of 395 to 396 yuan. Today, 280 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Shantou, 95 pieces to Hong Kong, 95 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 1,365 pieces to Haiphong. The amount of purchases by each trade group is listed below: Same traders Qiwu Wenzhou 35 Inland 25 Fuzhou 20 Yunnan 20 Shantou 30 Northern traders 20 Sichuan 10 Total 1,05</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market situation is gloomy, because demand from all parties is not smooth, so the market price is difficult to advance. There is also a theory that Yantai is also subject to the Japanese control of exchange, and the shipment of Japanese yarn to the north is not cost-effective, so sentiment is indeed frustrated. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue is 311 yuan, and the spot price of Lanfeng yarn is 308 to 307 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Daily Output of 2,000 Tons of Coal Balls; Still Not Enough to Sell</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, due to the severe weather, the sales of coal balls have increased sharply. Various factories, large and small, are working day and night, and the daily output is more than 2,000 tons, but it is still not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, the market price has turned firm, and the underground competition has disappeared invisibly. From the same industry, Yitai Xing coal balls are 33 yuan per ton, and Nanyang Shuanglong Brand coal balls are 32 yuan. Adding car force, the retail price at the door is about 1.78 yuan per 100 jin.</p>
<h3>White Coal Dust Falls</h3>
<p>High-grade white coal dust has been difficult to support its position recently due to sluggish sales. Because local stock is abundant and the source is endless, the cargo owners have to cut prices and throw out. Although some firms sold it with spot goods, the number of sales was still limited. Yesterday, the market opened Hongji No. 1 dust for 98 yuan per ton, a decrease of 1 yuan compared to last week. No. 2 dust was 92 yuan per ton, which seemed livelier.</p>

<h3>Wartime Civic Education Promoted in Chongqing; Minister of Education Chen Delivers a Speech; Emphasizing the Implementation of Civic Education; Teaching Time Reduced to Two Months</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) In view of the urgency of the times and the need to mobilize the people without delay, the Ministry of Education has launched wartime civic education supplementary classes. It was previously implemented in Wuhan and proved quite effective. Recently, it has been continued in Chongqing City. Various civic schools have already started classes. Minister Chen delivered a special speech to call the attention of the public. The original text is as follows: The central government started implementing supplementary education for out-of-school citizens in the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic. It stipulated that within six years, all out-of-school citizens across the country who are beyond the age of compulsory education should receive four months of supplementary education. Unfortunately, after only one year of implementation, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and the entire country fell into a state of war. Considering the urgency of the times and the need to mobilize the people without delay, the Ministry of Education has implemented wartime civic education supplementary classes to meet the current urgent needs and achieve the effectiveness of mobilizing the people. On the one hand, the content and methods of education have been appropriately changed. On the other hand, the teaching time has been shortened to two months. The content especially emphasizes the implementation of civic education. It was previously piloted in Wuhan and proved quite effective. Recently, it has been continued in Chongqing City. Since October 24th, a total of 600 civic schools have started classes, enrolling 30,000 illiterate adults. The following three points should be understood by the public:</p>
<p>(1) Educational Content</p>
<p>The most basic purpose of national education is to cultivate sound citizens. During the War of Resistance, emphasis should be placed on cultivating citizens' knowledge and skills in order to shoulder the major mission of resisting aggression and building the country. Therefore, the content of wartime civic education, in addition to literacy education, especially emphasizes the implementation of civic education, paying attention to stimulating public awareness, cultivating knowledge and skills for the War of Resistance, and developing a spirit of wartime service. Therefore, the allocation of monthly teaching time stipulates that civic training (including spiritual speeches, current affairs reports, wartime common sense, etc.) accounts for three minutes, singing (mostly songs about promoting national consciousness) accounts for twenty minutes, and the national language accounts for fifty minutes. Moreover, students in the school receive training in the basics of civil rights and general political activities. After graduation, they are also subjected to various wartime organizations. Therefore, the content of this wartime civic education supplementary class is not only for literacy.</p>
<p>(2) Implementation Methods</p>
<p>In the past, literacy education conducted in various places mostly used guidance or persuasion methods to attract citizens to enroll. However, the general public has no habit of enrolling in schools and often neglects it, resulting in the teacher's earnest exhortations being met with indifference, and the effectiveness is very small. However, it is not known that education is a national undertaking. The government has the responsibility to provide education, and the people also have the obligation to enjoy education. Moreover, this wartime civic education supplementary class is a special measure to meet the needs of wartime. Chongqing has a large population, and it is stipulated that it should be popularized within one year. In order to promote it quickly, compulsory methods are adopted. The Baojia organization and administrative power are used to extract illiterate people and assign them to various civic schools for teaching, in order to achieve quick results.</p>
<p>(3) Mobilizing Intellectuals</p>
<p>Intellectuals are cultivated by the country in peacetime and have already enjoyed the priority of educational rights. In the spirit of "those who know first awaken those who know later, and those who are aware awaken those who are aware later," they originally bear the responsibility of educating the people. During this period of the War of Resistance, the performance of intellectuals is extremely enthusiastic and admirable. Now that the war is even more serious, it is urgently hoped that everyone will rise up and engage in the most sacred duty for the country. Education is a national undertaking, and it cannot be handled solely by the government. It must be promoted with the unanimous assistance of all the people. Therefore, the teachers required for the wartime civic education supplementary class in Chongqing City, in addition to a part being hired by the government with funding, also mobilize intellectuals to participate in volunteering as teachers in civic schools, contributing their efforts and intelligence, and serving the country to fulfill the responsibility of resisting aggression and building the country. The Ministry of Education and people from all walks of life should provide more assistance to this事业 with great significance so that it can proceed smoothly and complete the mission given by this era. School Overview</p>
<h3>Qiaoguang Middle School</h3>
<p>Qiaoguang Middle School on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai was founded in the 20th year of the Republic, initiated by Yu Youren, Dai Kuizhi, Qiu Hanping, and others. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic, it was approved for registration by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. In the summer of the same year, it was also registered with the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Mr. Qiu served as the first principal. In the first semester of the 21st year, there were more than 400 students. Later, the school moved from Ximo Road to Nanyuan and added a primary school department. The number of students increased to 700. Later, because Mr. Qiu's law affairs were complicated and he had no time to take care of it, the Board of Directors hired Wu Jize as the principal. Since Mr. Wu took over, he has focused on planning, and the school's reputation has grown. The number of students has increased sharply. The original school buildings were not enough, so in March last year, they moved to the Chunyinlu Building at No. 826 Xiaoshadu Road. Since the August 13th Incident, most of the schools in Shanghai have been greatly affected, seven or eight out of ten. However, the school has not been affected by any of it because it is located in a safe place. In terms of education management, it adheres to the past spirit and insists on strictness. The current teaching staff includes Zhu Cuigong, Director of Academic Affairs, Xin Shu, Director of Moral Education, Zheng Yimei and Sha Wenguang for Chinese, Xia Sun and Ji Liang Sheng for English, and Wei Yousong, Tiao Hongpei, and Xu Anren for mathematics and science. They are all famous teachers in Shanghai. Currently, the school has more than 700 students. In view of the increasing number of out-of-school youths in the inland, the school has set up two branch schools in Eastern Zhejiang and Northern Jiangsu to provide relief. One is in Huangxiang, Taixing County, Northern Jiangsu, with more than 200 students, and the other is in Ninghai, Zhejiang, with nearly 300 students. Together with the Shanghai Main School, there are a total of more than 1,200 students. The school also has a large field, so it has always attached importance to sports. The Qiaoguang Cup fundraising basketball league held this year can not only promote sports, but also assist refugees, which is a win-win situation and is praised by the society.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Middle School</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Middle School was jointly founded by the remaining teachers and staff of the former Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou Senior High School and the Provincial Jiaxing Middle School in Shanghai. Wang Baoshan, the former Director of Academic Affairs of Hangzhou High School, and Wang Zhe'an, the former Director of Academic Affairs of Jiaxing Middle School, have been serving for many years. Last August, they gathered colleagues to prepare for the establishment of the private Zhejiang Middle School at No. 652 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment. There are more than 250 students, both male and female, and more than 20 faculty members. All of them are qualified teachers certified by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education for secondary schools. The courses at all levels are based on the revised junior and senior high school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education in June of the 25th year of the Republic. The curriculum is divided into junior high school grades 1, 2, and 3, and senior high school general, business, and German classes for grades 1, 2, and 3. The German class was originally established by the National Tongji University and Hangzhou High School. Since Tongji moved south and Hangzhou High School was closed, the students in this class had no way to transfer schools. The Bureau of Education could not bear to hear their grievances, so they consulted with the former German professors Suiduo Fu and Han Buge, who agreed to continue the class, and were supported by Principal Weng of Tongji University. In the future, they will be able to directly take the university entrance examination. Since the school opened, teaching and guidance have remained the same, and it has been able to maintain the excellent academic atmosphere of the original school. Starting from the next semester, in terms of equipment, it will strive to enrich it. The new school site has been selected at the third floor of Science Instruments on Fuzhou Road and the Run Kang Village Building next to Xieqiao General Assembly Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education on private schools, it has applied to the Ministry of Education for registration.</p>

<h3>International Cup Football Semifinals Tomorrow; Scotland vs. Jewish Team; Hualian Team Plays Portugal the Day After Tomorrow; Zilin Cup Starts Two-Week Tournament Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In this year's International Cup football semi-finals, Scotland vs. the Jewish team will clash at the first stadium of the Racecourse at 2:30 pm tomorrow. The Jewish team is a "dark horse" and has often had one or two amazing masterpieces in previous years. In 1936-37, it eliminated England to gain the right to the final, but ultimately fell short and lost to Portugal. This year's strength is undoubtedly above the previous one, and it can be seen from the 4-1 victory over Russia. However, Scotland has a neat lineup. Thomson, Fraser, and McGun of Xifu are even sharper. In the first game, they defeated France 7-2, which was not a fluke. Comparing the skills of the two teams, the Jewish team seems to be inferior. Therefore, after Scotland won the last championship in 1932-33, this year's ambition has risen again, and they are full of expectations for three victories in three battles. The other game, Hualian vs. Portugal, will meet at Yiyuan at 10:30 am the day after tomorrow. The Portuguese team is full of fierce generals. Although the left wing A. Tequan has left Shanghai, it is still a strong team. Hualian, composed of Donghua Lido, under the leadership of Sun Tielitui, defeated England, and its strength has been seen to be strong. If they can not underestimate the enemy and not be discouraged, the hope of victory is strong. If they continue to work hard, they will definitely be able to drink Huanglong and add infinite glory to the country's sports on the isolated island football scene. All the team members should encourage themselves. The Shanghai United Jia Group will start the second round the day after tomorrow. Dongsele will play the French Chamber of Commerce again. The two teams tied 2-2 last week. At that time, I don't know who will win. Due to the International Cup semi-finals, there is only one game. The Zilin Cup will also start its second week tomorrow. The French Army will play the Surveying Team. In addition, there will be two other games this week: the Reserve Group Zhendan vs. the French Chamber of Commerce, one B Group game, and three C Group games: Shengguang vs. Vites. The Park United Yuan has changed from Lido to Tongwen. The referees for each game have been assigned. The details are recorded as follows.</p>

<h3>Western Football Club Notifies All Teams; Prevent Rough and Dangerous Actions; Violations Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football Federation, in view of the recent frequent occurrences of rough and dangerous actions, and the disputes caused by the audience's support for a certain team, in order to prevent the recurrence of the same situation, has issued a notice, which is translated as follows: The Committee of the Wooden Federation is deeply concerned and horrified by the recent frequent occurrence of brutal and dangerous actions, which are spreading in the Shanghai football world. In recent weeks, referees have reported a large number of players from various clubs engaging in violent behavior, dangerous encroachment, dangerous obstruction, rude behavior, and other violations. In order to prevent the above actions and encourage the proper spirit of sports, the Committee has decided to notify all members to pay attention and warn that any players reported to have committed any of the above-mentioned actions will be severely punished. All members must advise their supporters that the club will be punished if the supporters of a certain club damage the good name of football. During the game, all clubs must patiently accept the referee's judgment under any circumstances. If they feel there is reason to protest, they must proceed in accordance with formal procedures and must not engage in free actions on the field.

<h3>Congratulations to the "New Man"</h3>
<p>— Wang Yin</p>
<p>During the New Year, it's customary to become a "new man."</p>
<p>According to long-standing custom, this naturally means putting on new clothes and showing them off everywhere. However, even this simple thing is truly difficult to achieve in China today. Most people can't even get enough to eat, so talking about buying new clothes is out of the question. Of course, I'm only referring to the common people.</p>
<p>A segment of the upper class is different. Although it's said to be a time of "national crisis," they still put on new clothes and show them off everywhere. — But that's not quite right, because those kinds of upper-class people often wear new clothes and show them off everywhere, even when it's not the New Year. So, can they not become "new men" during this New Year? Not at all. They have other, even better, ways.</p>
<p>They hop on a plane, float away to a safe zone, send a telegram, provide an interpretation of the enemy's sinister plans to create a smokescreen, and prepare to be promoted to the creators of a "New China." This startling move is an even more thorough way of becoming a "new man."</p>
<p>In the past, during the New Year, people always pasted red strips with the words "Universal Peace" on their doors. That era is gone. Now we have telegrams, and the language has also advanced, allowing for the elaboration of long articles of over a thousand words, broadcast throughout the country. Moreover, in the past, showing off was limited to one's own doorstep. Now we have airplanes, and showing off can be done very far away. This is indeed the New Year celebration method for a very unusual time in the 20th century.</p>
<p>But the "new man" himself doesn't admit that these actions are for the sake of becoming a "new man." He has his own terminology, which is: "sacrifice."</p>
<p>According to reports, those around the "new man" have stated that everyone should temporarily observe the "new man" with a wait-and-see attitude because the "new man" possesses a spirit of sacrifice, and they believe that he would never harm the country to such an extent.</p>
<p>A spirit of sacrifice is naturally a good thing. However, based on our experience, those who talk about sacrifice may not actually be sacrificing. For example, soldiers fighting on the front lines don't say they are sacrificing, but in reality, they truly are sacrificing. Even refugees who can't get enough to eat don't say they are sacrificing, but they are honestly sacrificing. However, in Shanghai this New Year, there are still many shops hanging up signs that say "Great Sacrifice at Low Prices," even though they also say it's for the "national crisis," but no one believes that it's the truth. — But if we only say that the "spirit" is rich in sacrifice, then naturally we can't be wrong.</p>
<p>As for telling everyone to "wait and see," that's still the old method. It means: Watch me perform magic, you just have to "stretch your necks and wait." But everyone knows what the result of stretching your neck like that will be. The word "guess" is also very clever. It turns out that the words in the telegram all come from "guesswork." Perhaps our "new man" thinks that with this one "guess," the enemy will have no choice but to "retreat."</p>
<p>Enough idle talk, the "new man" is originally a poet, so let me compose a poem to congratulate him. The poem says:</p>
<p>You, sir, are the leader of the reform,</p>
<p>Bustling during the New Year, seeking peace:</p>
<p>A half-day flight, congratulations on your departure,</p>
<p>A telegram, a startling announcement;</p>
<p>Wait and see, so that the people stretch their necks,</p>
<p>Guessing can teach the enemy to retreat.</p>
<p>Low prices in the streets show the merchant,</p>
<p>The spirit is equally rich in sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Duck Village</h3>
<p>— Xu Qi</p>
<p>The sky was shrouded in dark clouds, and the wind was swirling in mid-air, turning all our noses red.</p>
<p>Mountain ranges, one cluster after another, endless, lined up on the vast wilderness, the highway like a twisting snake, leading from the foot of the mountains to the waist, military vehicles busily driving to and fro. In this kind of weather, the driver recklessly removed the camouflage from the roof of the car.</p>
<p>We followed a small, crooked path, searching as we moved forward.</p>
<p>Ma Hanzi opened his wide mouth several times, wanting to laugh, but we stopped him each time. Speaking of him, he has quite a background, starting in the underworld at the age of thirteen, running to every corner of Shandong, and in twenty years, he has become a figure who fears nothing. But he has this one flaw, this big man still has a child's heart, acting foolishly all day long, never quiet for a moment. Now asking him to hurry along stealthily, it's really like he said himself, harder than dressing up as a woman. He whispered in my ear:</p>
<p>"With my ability to count the grains of rice that get carried up to the nest every day, what are a few devils worth!"</p>
<p>Several times I was almost led to speak by him, but with a glare from Qiao Biao, I shrank back.</p>
<p>Old Qiao really is like a veteran, that full beard, those electric-light-like eyes, really make people look at him with awe, which is perhaps the reason the battalion commander specially sent him to lead us.</p>
<p>Xiao Lao Si and Cao Defu are cousins, both from regular units, and both from Caozhou. Only I am from the south, and when the war of resistance began, I took off my coarse cloth shirt, dropped my worn brush, and joined the army.</p>
<p>My background made them seize the opportunity to make fun of me.</p>
<p>"Chen Qiufeng! Monkey brat! Talking about physiognomy, analyzing characters, smelling stinky feet!"</p>
<p>"This is really outrageous, the people of Jiangnan are born weak, but in which aspect are we inferior to you? Analyzing characters by their structure is also a livelihood! Humph!"</p>
<p>I would use this kind of talk to retaliate.</p>
<p>Now, no one is speaking, our feet are moving forward step by step, and because I want to show off the skills of a Jiangnan person, I refuse to fall behind at all, holding my rifle tightly in one hand, not letting go for a moment.</p>
<p>The night quietly fell, and the mountains turned a purplish-black. Qiao Biao pointed with three fingers, then drew a cross, telling us that we were still thirty miles away from Duck Village. Based on being faster than others when we set out, plus not stopping along the way, we predicted that our squad should be the first to seize the lead.</p>
<p>Road, thirty miles—twenty miles—ten miles.</p>
<p>Old Qiao suddenly made a "shhh" sound with his lips, signaling us to be quiet and quick, there was a possibility of discovering enemy sentries ahead at any time. So, we all crouched down and walked.</p>
<p>The road became more and more forked, and if we weren't careful, we would make a big circle. Fortunately, four of the five of us were experts, and we were already close to the foothills of the main peak of Duck Village.</p>
<p>Xiao Lao Si's eyes were quick, and he spotted someone ahead.</p>
<p>All five of us lay down.</p>
<p>"Bang!" Old Qiao fired a shot into the sky as a test.</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!" No more, no less, three signals in return.</p>
<p>"Good! It's our own!" We all jumped up and walked towards the mountain.</p>
<p>"Password?" Two guys, one tall and one fat, under a pine tree, acting pretty imposing.</p>
<p>"××××!"</p>
<p>The tall one smiled coldly, very arrogantly: "Early, huh?"</p>
<p>All of us were blushed from the question.</p>
<p>"Are there any fattened kids?" Old Qiao asked:</p>
<p>"Not many, a dozen devils, all together!"</p>
<p>Ma Hanzi was so angry that his eyes widened, and his wide mouth opened, looking like a toad, pulling on the other's lapel and saying:</p>
<p>"Good kid, you really have guts! I'm not as good as you!"</p>
<p>We all laughed.</p>
<p>The entire Duck Village was already immersed in darkness.</p>
<p>And speaking of "home" ... Guo Nidi</p>
<p>Another year has begun, and the literary world should naturally have a new atmosphere as usual. We have already seen articles such as "New Year's First Writing" and "Welcoming the Year of the Republic of China." We have also seen many articles that "regret the past" and "hope for the future." Although they are similar to "decoration," they are also in line with human nature; as long as they don't lead to "whitewashing peace," then it can reduce a little bit of the feeling of "shame."</p>
<p>Since I was a child, my concept of holidays has been pitifully weak, and when I grew older, I simply forgot about them completely. But this year I can't help but have some feelings, thinking about it, first, and the most important thing, is related to the war of resistance. And what I want to say is not some major national affairs, but something very small, a personal problem, which is "home." When the Northeast fell, I was still a young bird sheltered under the maternal wings of "home." After listening to the beautiful reports from the teachers at school, saying that countless compatriots there were displaced and suffering the disaster of being "homeless," I couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow in my fragile heart. Who knew that since last year, I would also encounter the same fate of "difficulty returning home." Now, I don't have to sleep in the streets, and the place where I live also has a roof over it, but in terms of status, I am a dependent. However, the one who is being relied upon is not someone like Lord Mengchang, but a relative who is not an official or nobleman. Therefore, there is no help to be given, and logically, there should be enough leisure. Indeed, there is leisure, but it is "enough" to be panicked. The children make a lot of noise in groups, and the radio is on all day long, making it impossible to read or write freely. In addition to my feelings, I can't help but think of "home." However, please see: "Our mountain forest was burned down by the × army, led by × soldiers, this spring, including the mountain forests of my fourth and sixth brothers, and all the mountain forests near the villages. The reason was to prevent bandits from hiding there in the summer. The villagers are all crying bitterly, and how will the family burn firewood next spring?"</p>
<p>Really, what will they do? The above is just a snapshot of a corner of the Northeast, from which we can also know a glimpse of the virtuous policies of the × army. Although my hometown does not have mountain forests or nurseries, there are many chickens and livestock. A few months ago, there was news in the newspaper about the wonderful methods of the × army for catching chickens. Under their oppressive power, even livestock cannot be at peace, let alone people?</p>
<p>Naturally, there are many other virtuous policies. Shooting and beheading are their consistent practices, and I am tired of hearing about them. However, I cannot help but secretly call out shame; living safely in the bustling foreign concessions, having the leisure to read some licentious and entertaining texts, my happiness is too much higher than others.</p>
<p>But when I think of "home," I can't help but feel guilty.</p>
<h3>Sea Breeze Song</h3>
<p>— Luo Xi</p>
<p>The sea is surging, the wind is howling. On the shore, by the mountains, the blood of fishermen has stained the vast blue sea and the green grass red.</p>
<p>The sea is the home of fishermen, and fishing is the livelihood of fishermen; for thousands of generations, no one has ever left this beautiful fishing village, this port full of fish.</p>
<p>Huge battleships floated in from the horizon, dyeing the blood of the fishermen a bright red.</p>
<p>Whoever dares to go to sea will not be able to return; whoever dares to go home will die under the knife; the chests of fishermen, the necks of fishermen, are blooming red flowers every day.</p>
<p>What kind of world is this!</p>
<p>Fishermen outside the range of the knives dare not go to sea, dare not go home. In the desolate countryside, people roar, people clamor:</p>
<p>"We want to go home, we want our port, we cannot starve to death in the wilderness!"</p>
<p>"We're going to die anyway, we might as well fight them!"</p>
<p>So, the men pick up harpoons, the women pick up stones; for the sake of the fishing village, for the sake of the port, none of the fishermen are afraid anymore.</p>
<p>The sea is surging, the wind is howling: blood and blood swirling, flesh and flesh fighting, in the fishing village, on the beach.</p>
<h3>Crossroads (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Yun Zhan</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Ermao, you can't say it that way," Liu Er said with emotion, "A good friend, a good relative, is someone who is willing to help in difficult times. Just last month, my mother was sick, and I reluctantly borrowed some money for medicine from my uncle. The amount wasn't enough, and that would have been fine, but I also had to listen to a lot of lectures and see a lot of ugly faces. I couldn't help but want to throw the money back at him at the time. So, I'm taking this path now, for the sake of my family's livelihood. It's forcing me to have no choice. In this day and age, unless you can make money, no one respects you."</p>
<p>These words struck Ermaozi's heart, and the disgust he had felt earlier turned into pity.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the truth! You're the only one who still looks up to us. I'll never forget that," she said, glancing at Ermaozi.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, you're welcome. We're friends, so we should help each other where we can. It's just that we've all suffered enough from the ×× people. It's hard to say whether Brother Ermao would be willing or not, given his personality. As for me, I've already jumped on the tiger's back; if I don't go, I'll starve to death. There's no gentleman's path left. It's really a case of 'being forced to join Liangshan.' If Brother Ermao has another way to think of, then of course he doesn't have to take on this bad reputation. As for me, I'm thinking of going to mess around for a while to avoid the rain, and we can take care of each other. But I won't advise him either way; he should make his own decision. I haven't been able to sleep well for several nights because of this matter!" His words were so sincere.</p>
<p>Ermaozi looked at his friend, looked at the woman, and thought about his own situation and the anger in his heart. Faced with this crossroads of life, death, honor, and disgrace, he couldn't say a word for a moment. He stood up, offered Liu Er a cigarette, lit it, and said slowly, "Brother Er, my mind is very confused right now. I'll give you an answer tomorrow! If I go, I go, if I don't go... we'll all go our separate ways! But I'm very grateful for your good intentions."</p>
<p>"Okay," Liu Er understood what he meant, exhaled a long puff of smoke, and stood up. "Then, I'll be going now. Goodbye!"</p>
<p>"Goodbye, goodbye!" Ermaozi saw him to the door.</p>
<p>His wife was stunned and couldn't lift herself up.</p>
<p>"Which one should I invite?"</p>

<p>National Medicine and Dietary Nourishment</p>
<h3>What is "Dietary Nourishment"?</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen said: "Chinese culture is backward in everything, except for the way of eating, which is unmatched in the world." In recent medicine, the most progressive inventions are "nutrition theory" and "nutritional therapy," which are revered throughout the world. However, this theory actually originated in China long ago. The Zhou Rituals established medical officials called "dietary physicians," who specialized in food therapy, which is called "dietary nourishment medicine." The King of Huainan wrote "Food Classics"; Zhu Xuan wrote "Dietary Therapy for Meals"; Sun Simiao wrote "Ancient and Modern Dietary Treatment"; Meng Shen wrote "Dietary Therapy Materia Medica," and there are about a hundred other types of food materia medica, all of which speak of nutritional theories. The earliness of the invention and the detail of the research are enough to astonish Westerners. Today's practitioners of national medicine all know about dietary restrictions and food conditioning, which is what is meant by "medicine and food have the same origin." Dr. Nakao of Japan obtained the "Dietary Therapy Materia Medica" from the Dunhuang Stone Chamber and highly praised Chinese nutritional therapy, writing a textual research that was highly valued at the time. However, our country rarely promotes this, isn't it regrettable? This publication takes the introduction of common sense in national medicine as its warp and food therapy and food nourishment as its weft, so it is named "National Medicine and Dietary Nourishment," and knowledgeable people are invited to correct it.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Appetizer</h3>
<p>— Ding Jihua</p>
<p>Poor digestion and loss of appetite are common causes of daily illness. Now there is a thing called "scorched barley," which is sold in pharmacies. Also, in the Shanghai area, elderly women from Pudong often shout along the road selling "scorched barley; barley noodles," which is this kind of barley, and its price is cheaper, costing three or five cents in silver dollars. If you can buy a very large quantity with three or five dimes, take a small amount of barley each time, and it can be made by boiling, looking like black tea.</p>
<p>"Barley tea" has a sweet and fragrant taste and can be loved by everyone. When we usually encounter a loss of appetite, fullness, or a lack of taste for everything, the aroma of barley tea, once it enters the mouth, is perceived as fragrant, appetizing, and delicious. After a short time, the stomach seems empty and hungry.</p>
<p>Barley tea functions to stimulate the appetite, promote qi, dispel dampness, and aid digestion.</p>
<p>When taking tonics in winter, you can replace tea leaves with barley tea. Women who have had liver qi for a long time, those who suffer from summer heat, or those who have frequent gastrointestinal problems should drink barley tea. When decocting, especially seek a concentrated brew, which is truly effective. The price is very economical, the taste is also delicious, and it can stimulate the appetite and aid digestion, which can indeed prevent many illnesses. A small spectrum of tonics</p>
<h3>Mutton</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Mutton is a yang-natured animal, and it is more suitable to eat in winter. Because mutton is warm and hot in nature and rich in fat, and the human body needs heat and fat in winter. Mutton has the effect of replenishing qi and blood and generating muscle, and its fat can moisturize dryness and treat dysentery. Ewe's milk is more effective than cow's milk and can treat vomiting. Lamb liver can clear heat, improve eyesight, extinguish wind, and kill insects. Lamb kidneys can nourish the waist, strengthen yang, and treat urinary problems. People with excessive phlegm, fire, and liver yang should not eat too much. Those suffering from various blood disorders should be excluded.</p>
<p>According to the Golden Chamber's formula for treating puerperal exhaustion, Dang Gui Sheng Jiang Yang Rou Tang is used to greatly replenish qi and blood, and its effect is superior to ginseng. When cooking, it is advisable to stew it with sea cucumber, radish, and chestnuts to make it fresh and nourishing. Adding walnuts reduces the muttony odor. It is also forbidden for those with occasional malarial fever, dysentery, jaundice, abdominal distention, cholera, smallpox, scabies, and other diseases.</p>
<h3>Beriberi</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanhe</p>
<p>From autumn to winter, in addition to the seasonal malaria and autumn warmth, most people suffer from beriberi and swelling. The saying of beriberi, not known in ancient times, began with Su Jing of the Jin Dynasty, who first created this name: but swelling, pain, numbness, and stubbornness are what the Internal Classic calls paralysis; slowness, relaxation, weakness, are what the Internal Classic calls flaccidity; and those who rush upward are what the Internal Classic calls reversal. East Asian doctor Matsui reviewed and used the theory of reversal in the Plain Questions as a framework to write a theory of beriberi prescriptions; while Danzhai Yuanyangde's beriberi category of prescriptions said that the various beriberi prescriptions of the Tang and Song dynasties were correct, and the theories of the Yuan and Ming dynasties were mostly empty. Therefore, Danzhai's category of prescriptions mostly came from the Tang and Song dynasties; Jincun Liangzhi's beriberi hook summary also exclusively adopted the prescriptions before the Tang and Song dynasties. Today, Western medicine believes that beriberi is caused by a lack of vitamin B in the body, with dry, wet, and acute types that have different symptoms and different treatments. We believe that leaning towards wind means spontaneous sweating; leaning towards cold means pulling pain and cramps; excess dampness means heavy swelling; excess heat means restlessness and thirst. Those with stubborn numbness and insensitivity in the lower abdomen often do not swell in the feet, but stubborn numbness leading to nausea, stuffiness, and shortness of breath means that the beriberi is rushing to the heart, which is extremely dangerous. In general, one should treat according to the symptoms, and in addition to treatment and medication; one should also live in a high and dry place and eat more bran and germ from grains, such as rice bran and wheat bran, which are richest in vitamin B, but eaters must do everything possible to eliminate the evil, and in fact take the dross and abandon the essence, so we usually prefer to eat brown rice, and in snacks, oatmeal, and in dishes, gluten (i.e. wheat gluten) should be eaten more.</p>
<h3>Dietary Nourishment for Blood Disorders</h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>For those suffering from lung disease with hemoptysis, intestinal heat with blood in the stool, and those who usually have insufficient qi and blood and have symptoms of blood deficiency, in addition to taking medicine, they can also use food therapy. There are four kinds of food that are most suitable. I will list them below:</p>
<p>Pork liver is slightly warm and non-toxic. It is richest in iron juice and has the effect of replenishing blood without the harm of pork producing phlegm. Taking soup or eating it boiled is very suitable. The Compendium of Materia Medica says that the liver is in charge of storing blood, so it is often used for blood diseases. Qianjin Wing has pork liver pills for treating dysentery, pork liver powder for treating prolapse of the anus, and pork liver powder in various eye treatments, all for this reason.</p>
<p>Spinach: its stem is soft, fleshy, and hollow, its leaves are green, greasy, and thick, and its roots are red, sweet, and delicious. It contains very sufficient nutrients, and if you pinch it with your fingers, you can see a kind of fatty substance, which is far more than other vegetables. Recently, people have commonly called spinach a food rich in iron juice and love to eat it. The Confucian Family Matters says: People who have been sick for a long time, constipation, and those with hemorrhoids should often eat spinach. It is smooth to nourish the orifices, naturally unblocking, has the function of nourishing the intestines and stomach, and replenishing blood. For those with blood deficiency and internal heat, using it as a side dish is of great benefit.</p>
<p>Lotus root is sweet, neutral, and beneficial in nature, and has the function of generating blood and dissolving stasis. It mainly treats all kinds of unstoppable hematemesis, bleeding from the mouth and nose, and postpartum blood deficiency. Mash it into juice and drink it often for very good results. Real lotus root powder is also good. This thing is especially good at stopping blood and nourishing blood without harming the true essence. Lotus root nodes are stronger in nature and better at stopping blood and breaking stasis, such as replenishing blood after blood loss, it is better to use lotus root powder.</p>
<p>White fungus is a tree-gum nutritional product that grows on blue oak trees, without branches or leaves, and is shaped like an ear, so it is also named wood ear. It is sweet and neutral in nature, nourishing yin and clearing dryness. It can treat metrorrhagia, persistent lochia, bloody dysentery, and blood in the stool. According to recent research, it is also effective in treating dry blood consumption in women.</p>
<h3>Bird's Nest (1)</h3>
<p>— Cao Bingzhang</p>
<p>Bird's nest is a famous tonic in our country, sometimes used as a delicacy, sometimes for medicinal purposes, which most people know. However, its name, origin, shape, and other valuable theories are not detailed in the Materia Medica, and I am afraid that few know them. I would like to write this article to tell the people of the country.</p>
<p>Name: It is the nest built by the swiftlet of the swift family, which eats saliva transformed from marine organisms, so it is called bird's nest. Those with feathers are called hairy bird's nest, those without feathers are called sun bird's nest, or Siamese bird's nest, or Dragon Tooth bird's nest.</p>
<h3>The Disease of Typhoid Fever: Changes in Condition and Dietary Regimen</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that typhoid fever is caused by exposure to wind and cold. However, the greatest cause is due to dietary indiscretion. Illness enters through the mouth, and the stomach and intestines are the source of the disease. Therefore, observe dietary restrictions, provide nourishment, and adhere to the regimen on time. If one still eats recklessly while ill, what difference is there from harming oneself? Overeating after illness can also lead to death overnight. Improper diet after illness can easily lead to consumption and decline. Proper diet after illness provides an opportunity to transform from weak to strong. Therefore, one must pay attention to 'dietary regimen' in typhoid fever. Its importance is evident.</p>
<p>Patients with this disease are mostly men in their twenties and thirties. They often have strong bodies and are accustomed to enduring cold and eating indiscriminately. For more than a decade, they rarely develop a fever. But once the accumulation becomes deep and the disease breaks out, its momentum is sure to be great. Thus, the illness lasts one or two months, teetering between life and death.</p>
<p>What traditional Chinese medicine calls typhoid fever has a broad scope, including five types of diseases: Wind-induced typhoid fever, Cold-induced typhoid fever, Damp-warm typhoid fever, Warm disease (commonly known as warm-heat typhoid fever; in spring it's called spring-warm or wind-warm, in autumn it's called autumn-warm, in winter it's called winter-warm), and Heatstroke (commonly known as summer-warm typhoid fever). The progression of these five types of typhoid fever changes in weekly stages, theoretically following six stages, known as the six meridians. Now, I will list the stages in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Seven days is the normal duration of one stage, but there is no fixed rule. Some may enter the second stage on the second day. If treated properly, there is a good chance of recovery within one or two weeks. The course of typhoid fever ends here, and it does not necessarily have to go through all six stages. This point must be understood.</p>
<p>(A) Symptoms of the First Stage: The obvious symptom of the onset of typhoid fever is fever, along with headache and stiffness in the neck. Those affected by wind are particularly sensitive to wind, and the fever does not subside even with sweating, with nasal congestion or slight nausea. Those affected by cold are particularly sensitive to cold, without sweating, with a fluctuating fever, slight panting and coughing, and pain throughout the body. The main symptoms in this stage are fever and headache. At this time, it is appropriate to use methods to induce sweating, which often lead to a cure in the first week.</p>
<p>The onset of various warm diseases involves a fluctuating fever, thirst, and no great aversion to cold in the first week, similar to the following second week. The onset of damp-warm disease is characterized by fatigue, weakness in the limbs, dizziness, a heavy feeling in the head, poor appetite, and chest tightness as the most prominent symptoms. There may be slight discomfort from abdominal congestion. The fluctuating fever persists despite all treatments. This type is most common in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(B) Symptoms of the Second Stage: The fever shifts to a fluctuating type, rising as high as 102-103 degrees. Sweating does not reduce the fever. There is no aversion to cold, but there is dizziness, dry lips and mouth, thirst, restless sleep with many dreams, dry eyes and nose, constipation, hot and reddish urine, a feeling of fullness in the stomach and intestines, and a bitter or bland taste in the mouth with no desire for food. In more severe cases, the fever reaches 104-105 degrees during this stage, with restlessness and insomnia, frequent muttering in sleep, repeating everyday trivial matters without realizing it, mental irritability, and a greasy, turbid complexion.</p>
<p>During this stage, passing gas and stool is a good sign. Nighttime muttering that seems like seeing ghosts is not too serious. However, if the eyes stare straight ahead and there is panting, the condition is dangerous. At this time, clearing heat and promoting bowel movements is the appropriate treatment. If treated properly, the mind will clear up after one or two doses, easily turning danger into safety. This is the worst period for typhoid fever symptoms, appearing extremely critical on the surface, but actually not necessarily fatal. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Turnip and Pear for Throat Ailments</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huailin</p>
<p>Late autumn and early winter are the most rampant seasons for throat ailments. From autumn to winter, the weather gradually cools down. For home heating, people inevitably use stoves or similar devices. Even the most economical option involves lighting a coal briquette stove for warmth. At the same time, the wind is dry and harsh. Indoor air is hot and dry, while outdoor wind is dry. These conditions are the biggest causes of throat ailments. This is why throat ailments are common in late autumn and early winter.</p>
<p>Turnip is a vegetable that everyone loves to eat. Its natural sweetness, combined with proper cooking, makes it a delicious dish that is not expensive. Analyzing its components, the nutrients are very abundant. It also has the effects of resolving phlegm, moisturizing dryness, and aiding digestion.

<h3>The More It Is Done, the More Stiff It Becomes</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>That Japan has decided to use force against China and has become so exhausted was originally unexpected.</p>
<p>Japan wanted to take a chance and not use force. Using force was originally out of necessity. They originally expected that if they really used force, they could finish the matter in two or three months. Because China did not have modern weapons, and even if they did, they were very few. Moreover, China was not a warlike country. Without any effort, it would be like something in a bag, easily obtained.</p>
<p>Who knew that after fighting for three months, China's resistance strength not only did not disappear, but gradually increased. Thus, they greatly advocated a three-year war. By the time Nanjing fell and the battle line became longer, the goal of victory became less certain. Thus, they greatly advocated a ten-year war. By the time Wuhan fell and Guangdong was not defended, the war zone became even wider, and our country's resistance strength and spirit became even more excited. Japan's grasp of victory became more difficult, so they greatly advocated a hundred-year war.</p>
<p>From undeclared war to now, only a year and a half, and the Japanese war advocates have already gone from three years to ten years, from ten years to a hundred years. If we continue to resist for another year or two, I think they will definitely greatly advocate a thousand-year war and a ten-thousand-year war. This kind of argument, although it is their boastful talk, in fact, is enough to see the emptiness of its content and the panic of its mind.</p>
<p>Now, spreading all kinds of peace atmospheres is enough to see their cowardly disease. They have already advocated military occupation before, so why spread peace atmospheres after? The time for advocating peace and advocating a ceasefire has passed. Now, let's play three hundred rounds and fight to the death before talking.</p>
<h3>The Reappearance of Ice Skating Mania</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>It's getting cold, and the ice skating season has begun. In this city of Shanghai, ice skating will definitely reappear in the future, and the facts have already given us ironclad proof.</p>
<p>Ice skating was originally a northern pastime. I don't know why, but it developed a fondness for Shanghai after it became an "isolated island" and spread to the south amid the gunfire. Ice skating and swimming are opposites, alternating with each other. When swimming is in full swing during the summer, ice skating rinks disappear. But now, swimming pools are silent, while ice skating rinks are starting to get lively.</p>
<p>As far as we remember, ice skating in Shanghai did not start today. More than ten years ago, the New World had an ice skating rink. Later, other game fields and the Bansong Garden in Nanshi also had ice skating rinks. It's just that at that time, there were always a few frivolous women skating in the ice skating rink every day, and those men went ice skating, but their hearts were not on the wine, they were also attracted by these women, just like the donkey racing field. The ice skating technique is also very simple, just circling around, and the ice skates are also a more common and clumsy type.</p>
<p>In the northern countries, ice skating is bound to be quite popular in winter. Students from various universities will also hold masquerade ice skating parties. But in Shanghai, there are not many rivers, and even in the cold weather, the ice in the river is not very thick and cannot be skated on, so Shanghai people's ice skating is just skating on cement and floors. In the past, ice skating was only seen in game fields, but three and a half months after the end of the Shanghai battle, Shanghai people suddenly became interested in ice skating, as if they had been stimulated by something. The entire spring was caught up in ice skating mania.</p>
<p>Because of the sudden popularity of ice skating, many ice skating rinks appeared in Shanghai one after another. In addition to the specially set up ice skating rinks, some dance halls also closed a part and used it exclusively for ice skating, creating many ice skating talents in a very short period of time. On Saturdays and Sundays, fashionable women and trendy young men went to the ice skating rink together to show off their skills. It costs two to six cents per hour, and it costs a lot of money to play all day. Ice skates are more sophisticated than before, all imported, and each pair costs at least five or six yuan, or even more than ten or twenty yuan. Ice skating skills have also improved, what with going backwards, doing circles, doing one-footed, doing cross-legged... Several ice skating rinks have also held masquerade ice skating parties, ice skating competitions, ice skating basketball games and other things, attracting skaters and spectators.</p>
<p>Men are so enthusiastic about ice skating, and the girls are not willing to be outdone, and many have trained in special ice skating skills. Even young students and children are fascinated by ice skating. On the school's playground or on the road in front of the school gate, as soon as class is dismissed, students are ice skating. In every alley, especially on Sundays, there will be many children and adults practicing ice skating. When they learn, they go to the ice skating rink to show off their skills. If they can't afford ice skates, there are people who rent them. The children's accumulated pocket money, when it is full of five or six yuan, they will buy ice skates. Dad will say to his son: "If you get good grades this year, I will buy you a pair of ice skates as a reward."</p>
<p>The whole city is in the atmosphere of ice skating, and as a result, many bosses who opened ice skating rinks made a lot of money, and the number of imported ice skates sold was even more amazing. In large companies, a special window is closed, displaying various ice skates, for men, women, and children, everything is available. These days, the north wind is howling and the weather is cold, and everywhere on every road and every alley there are people practicing ice skating. All the ice skating rinks were closed during the entire swimming season, and now they are busy arranging and preparing for opening, and some have already been in business for a long time. - Everything, all the facts tell us that on the isolated island, the ice skating thing will definitely be popular again in the future, and will only stop when the swimming season starts in late spring and early summer.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Hangxie Qi</p>
<p>Actor Magazine</p>
<p>There is also a type of "Actor Magazine," which is a semi-monthly publication that began in September of the third year of the Republic (1914), edited by "Feng Shujun." It is a 32-size book, with 40 pages per volume, set in four-point type. The first page prints the "Intent of Publication," believing that "the theater world at that time, from an external perspective, seems to be developing, but in reality, art is declining, which is a matter of great concern." Therefore, this magazine was published with the intention of correcting it. The content of the magazine is divided into:</p>
<p>Writings - Essays, scripts, textual research, lyrics.</p>
<p>Reviews - Character reviews, play reviews, performance reviews, theater reviews.</p>
<p>Records - Performance news, business news, actor whereabouts.</p>
<p>Miscellany - Literature, anecdotes, communications.</p>
<p>It includes illustrations, a portrait of Ibsen, and a small photo of the editor. The first issue has an essay on "Ibsen's Drama," which is a verbal account by Chen Jingruo based on the text of Tsubouchi Shōyō, mainly introducing Ibsen's life's work. There is "A Fundamental Study of New Struggle Drama." In terms of commentary, there is "The Future of Free Theater," indicating the inevitable decline of "curtain plays." The play reviews include "The Opening Night of the Spring Willow Theater," performing "The Airship Team." There is also a review of the "New People's Society" performing "Wang Xifeng Makes a Big Fuss in the Ningguo Mansion." The "New People's Society" then reviewed their "Righteous Brother Wu Song." At the end, there is an attached "New Record of Actors."</p>
<p>Next is the play "Xia Jinguizi's Self-Immolation Record." Only three acts were published in the first issue, unfinished. The important text in the record category is "The Progress of New Drama in the Past Year," which lists the rise and fall of the two main theater groups, "New People's Society" and "Min Wu Society," as well as the various societies of "Puhua," "Yifeng," "Wenming," "Kaiming," and "Qiming." It finally begins to describe "Spring Willow" and praises it. The "Miscellaneous Records" section includes "Xiaohongxuan's Leisurely Talk on Watching Plays," "Minor Remarks on Actors," and "Beijing Opera Terminology."</p>
<p>Overall, apart from some "historical material" significance, there are no advantages to mention.</p>
<p>(Addendum) Regarding the "菴" in "Twentieth Century Grand Stage," according to a friend, it is Sun 菴 from Wuxi, author of "Ming 菴 Min Lu," who edited the "Oriole and Flower Magazine" during the Republic of China period. Regarding the "List of Surnames of Female Ballad Singers" published in Shen Bao mentioned in the "Female Ballad Singing" article, if anyone wishes to borrow or read it, please contact the "Spring and Autumn" editor.</p>
<h3>Sweet Osmanthus Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>Raidon-Hua Production, Showing at the Greater Shanghai Theatre</p>
<p>"Sweet Osmanthus Fragrance" is a "romantic" translation. Well then, naturally you want to know what its "content" is like. Here, I will temporarily act as a "storyteller"—it seems that there is also this profession in foreign countries, called Story Teller.</p>
<p>"Young Bill likes fish and wants to go to the South Seas to study fisheries. The beginning of the film introduces Bill, and a fish truck is overturned by a car, which also introduces the young girl Sheila to meet Bill.</p>
<p>"However, Bill's father (milk factory owner) does not approve of Bill's ambition. He asks Bill to temporarily work as a milk deliveryman for thirty days, stipulating that if he performs well, he will allow Bill to go to the South Seas to study fisheries.</p>
<p>"So Bill puts on a white uniform and begins the 'rich son delivering milk to find a beautiful woman.'</p>
<p>"One day, Bill asks Sheila to go to a dance, and Sheila agrees. However, her mother insists that she accompany the pretentious Wallace to the banquet, so she refuses Bill's invitation. That night, unexpectedly, at the dance, Bill blames her for breaking her word, and when she sees that Bill has also come with a female companion, she retorts, and they part unhappily.</p>
<p>"Bill, feeling that he has offended the girl, knocks on her door late at night, wanting to see her, and imitates the story of 'Romeo and Juliet,' Bill plans to climb over the window with a ladder. Wallace, however, calls the police, and 'Romeo' is arrested by the police.</p>
<p>"At this time, Bill only has one day left of work, so Sheila drives the milk truck for Bill.</p>
<p>"The girl's mother discovers that Sheila is missing and reports to the police that she has been kidnapped.</p>
<p>"Just then, Bill is released and meets the girl on the road. This is the climax of the film. The cars of the detectives and the girl's mother are chasing the milk truck, and Sheila throws milk bottles backwards, causing the chasing cars to slide off the road.</p>
<p>"They rush back to the milk factory, just in the last second of reporting in. I heard a lady in the next seat exclaim, 'Oh my!' It's really too dangerous."</p>
<p>Now you naturally know the ending of "Sweet Osmanthus Fragrance." Maid's Night Out, this Nora who runs away at night, marries Bill. The old father and old mother also forget themselves and start kissing.</p>
<p>Isn't this a "romantic" and "humorous" story?</p>
<p>The director is very "honest," but like my story telling, it is not "fluent."</p>
<p>Alan Enlai (Bill) is average. Joan Fontaine is still innocent and lovely.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The One-Armed Old Man Organizes a Free Village; Twin Girls Reverently Visit the Martyrs' Tomb</p>
<p>Once the He family arrived in Shanghai, they inevitably had many social engagements. Although modern China's citizens are extremely advocating frugality and sweeping away all extravagant habits, Shanghai is a different matter, because it is where merchants from all over the world gather, and the material level also surpasses the ordinary. At that time, Mr. He naturally had a group of people from the business, transportation, and financial circles, as well as other circles, inviting him to banquets almost every day. Among them, not only were there locals, but mostly merchants from Europe and America. Miss He also had her old classmates, little sisters, etc., and recently, the banquets invite both men and women, completely unlike before when only male guests were invited and no family members. Therefore, when inviting Mr. He, they would definitely invite his two daughters together. Mostly, the two ladies are twins, born looking exactly like him, and everyone, moved by curiosity, wants to invite them to admire them. However, such banquets, occasionally once or twice, are harmless, but if they continue often, they will feel bored. Now that Mr. He has arrived in Shanghai, it is truly banquets scheduled every day. Today it is the British Overseas Chinese General Assembly, tomorrow it is the French Consulate General, the day after tomorrow it is the American Shanghai Transportation Company, and the day after that it is the Soviet Tea Trade Association. Whenever there is Mr. He on the invitation, there must also be Miss He. For the rest of the guests, both male and female guests are invited. Naturally, proper banquets are all dinners. Later, dinners became too crowded, so they changed to lunch, and even lunches became too crowded, so they changed to tea parties. Mostly, when foreigners invite guests, if the two ladies do not go, it seems a bit rude, but it makes people unhappy. These days, it really makes people feel tired. One day, Sir He said to his two daughters: "Such social engagements are really suffering. We need to be quiet for a few days. Fortunately, I received a telegram today that I am going to Beiping and Tianjin. When the matters in Beiping and Tianjin are settled, I will also go to the Northeast. When you came here, didn't you say you wanted to see your good classmate Zhu Airen? Then, when I go to the north, you can go see your classmate, right? There is one more thing... Now, my duties may often be here, but it's not certain. However, Shanghai is too prosperous and too noisy, and I don't want to live in Shanghai all the time. It's best to find a residence that is not too far from Shanghai, and has fresh air and a good environment. Once we have a suitable address, we might build a small villa, which is not impossible. However, transportation must be a little convenient. When you go to your classmate's place, also pay attention to it at any time." (11)</p>

<h3>A Year's Major Events of Yifeng (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>Since the public performance of Yifeng Society, a flick of the fingers, it has been a full year. In these short 365 days, personnel changes, and the ever-changing situation, based on what I have heard and seen, I cannot help but feel a sense of impermanence. But its affairs were not enough to tell outsiders at first, so I dared not write them down. This column, for the New Year's supplement, asked for my stupid article to fill in the blanks, so I chose what can be revealed a little to prepare for future collectors of chrysanthemum history, and also to see the difficulty of creating a business.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 26th year, Fang Carlton was reorganized, and Xinfang led Bosui Xiaowei to make a comeback. It happened to be the Nanjing Road parade incident, with swords drawn and crossbows bent, and the situation was precarious. The middle section of Jing'an Temple Road was blocked, and barbed wire once blocked the entrance of the theater. Although there were still enthusiastic people who booked seats, seizing the flashes of knives, arranging wooden frames, and bravely entering the hospital to buy tickets, how would the situation be the next day, could we open the gong as scheduled, it was really uncertain. That night, we originally booked to gather colleagues from before and after the stage at Wufoulou to celebrate the opening wine, but when the clock rang eight times, few arrived, Xiaolan was smart, and her feet did not reach the spot. There was no joy in the whole seat, and the mood was bleak. Fortunately, the situation eased the next day, and we were able to open the gong as usual, but the results were very plain. After ten days, we gradually saw improvement. On the evening of the closing ceremony, I invited Chunhang to guest star in Huatian Cuo. As soon as the posters came out, the seats were booked empty. The hairpins and shadows of women were at their most prosperous for a time. In addition, Xinfang reversed the role and disguised herself as a woman. The laughter from the four seats shook the roof. In the midst of everyone's joy, the embroidered curtain slowly fell. It was unexpected, and the gradual prosperity in the coming year really started from here.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 27th year, Wen Kui and Sulian returned, and the lineup was as flourishing as a raging fire. At the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, there were no empty seats. However, with the gradual revelation of Sulian's brilliance, a matter of incompetence occurred. Many of the people who had always spoken for Xiaolan suddenly gathered arrows at Sulian, scolding and slandering, gradually implying and criticizing Xinfang and Bosui. The backstage's feelings for Xiaolan gradually became lonely. Xiaolan also felt deeply uneasy, and finally had to endure the pain of saying goodbye. Xiaolan was usually gentle and quiet, humble and graceful, diligent in her work, and did not ask about foreign affairs. She never had any disagreements with her colleagues before and after the stage. She also did not have any obvious friction with Lian. However, the situation was restricted by the situation, and she was uneasy in her position. The end of the affair was not her fault. It is not deplorable! Tian Chang and I both tried to run and persuade, but there was no way to turn the tide. On the eve of going north, at Qian Zhi's restaurant, the farewell was reluctant, and I really could not bear the pain of regretting the talented 扌. During the summer, I received a letter from her father, knowing that she had already established an army in the old capital, and her reputation was very good, and I was overjoyed for her, only hoping that she would rise to the top and her reputation would spread.</p>
<p>After Xiaolan left, Lian performed Xiaowan, and the business did not decline slightly. Compared with the birth of Wen Ruyu, due to the long performance period, the extreme splendor, it returned to plainness. Chunhang once strongly advocated early closing, but because the new play could not be connected, Xinfang strongly advocated caution in the arrangement of Xiangfei, and had to use the old plays of Judge Zhao's Death and Hate of Shu as a transition. At the same time, we had to step up the search for Qingyi candidates to make up for Xiaolan's absence.</p>
<h3>A Newly Discovered Talent: Tsai Chin, the Star of "Meng Jiang Nü"</h3>
<p>From Stage Actress to Silver Screen Star</p>
<p>Since film industry personnel flocked to the mainland, the film business on the "isolated island" seemingly encountered a predicament due to a lack of actors. However, from another perspective, it clearly provided a new direction for the stagnant Chinese film industry. This shift broke the bad habit of various companies being afraid to use new talent.</p>
<p>Under the star system, there are often many exceptionally talented actors unfortunately buried in the ranks of unsung heroes, without the opportunity to showcase their abilities. In the past, the silver screen was dominated by a few old actors struggling to hold the stage. However, it is perhaps precisely because of this reason that audiences become weary and lose their faith in the film industry. How tragic it would be to compare this situation with Hollywood, which constantly unearths new talent! However, although we are still hesitant to believe that film merchants have awakened, shifted their focus, and intentionally promoted new talent, newcomers finally have the opportunity to appear.</p>
<p>This brings us to the new star, Tsai Chin.</p>
<p>"The Romantic Ghost" is her debut film, in which she plays Yun Lan, Lu Ming's sister. Her acting is quite skilled and lively. Although the content of this film cannot elicit our sympathy, her personal acting is so sincere and realistic that we cannot help but feel that she is a very promising newcomer on the silver screen.</p>
<p>She is from Hubei Province and grew up in Beiping. Her family background is quite good. Initially, she studied at Huiwen Girls' School in Nanjing and was very fond of drama. Later, she transferred to Shanghai Art School, where she studied Western music. Her original name was Tsai Yun-yu. At that time, she joined an amateur drama troupe and began acting. However, she was first discovered when the "Amateur Drama Association" performed "Thunderstorm" in 1936. Therefore, when the "Amateur Experimental Drama Troupe" was established, Ying Yunwei specifically invited her to join. After the August 13th Incident, "Bluebird" was established, and she stepped onto the stage again under the name Tsai Chin. The roles of Xiao Dongxi in "Sunrise" and Varvara in "Thunderstorm" were her performances that received unanimous praise from the theatrical community. From then on, she gradually came to be noticed, succeeding as a rising talent on the stage. This time, with the revival of "Star," Tsai Chin was recruited to partner with Lu Ming in the first film "The Romantic Ghost." Due to her serious and diligent acting, this favorable outcome led her to be promoted to one of the main characters in her second film, "Meng Jiang Nü," alongside Zhou Xuan and others.</p>
<h3>Appreciation of Dance (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jia Sheng</p>
<p>7.  Dramatic Dance</p>
<p>"Dramatic dance" is a type of theatrical dance. In terms of subject matter, it is similar to "narrative dance" in that it depicts an entire story. However, it incorporates dialogue and non-dance movements into its structure, with "dance" serving as the overall framework. Therefore, when appreciating this type of dance, do not treat it as a play. It should still be viewed as a dance form, but it should also contain elements of dramatic appreciation.</p>
<p>8.  Pantomime</p>
<p>Although the movements of "pantomime" are theatrical gestures, they originate from dance. Even modern pantomime contains many elements of dance. Therefore, the components of dance can also be seen in pantomime. Furthermore, when appreciating this type of dance, special attention must be paid to the dancer's facial expressions.</p>
<p>9.  Song and Dance</p>
<p>The term "song and dance" seems to be very popular in China recently, but what is being discussed here is not the kind of song and dance currently popular in China, but rather a type of artistic song and dance.</p>
<p>"Song and dance" is a comprehensive art form that places equal emphasis on song and dance. Using song to enhance the background of dance is the most effective way to bring out its effects. Similarly, using dance postures to express the emotions of song can also strengthen its expression, and it seems to be a step further.</p>
<p>10. Song and Dance Drama</p>
<p>Many people confuse "song and dance" with "song and dance drama," which is wrong. "Song and dance" is simply the combination of "song" and "dance," while "song and dance drama" is the organization of "song and dance" plus "drama." The so-called song and dance form of drama, song and dance, is a depiction of a theme, while song and dance drama is a description of a story. Appreciators should pay attention to the distinction between the two.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "song and dance drama" should not be mistaken for "opera," although both have dramatic structures. However, they differ in form and movement. Although the movements of "opera" originated from dance, after it became opera, it contained a wealth of spoken drama gestures. The movements of "song and dance drama" are purely dance gestures. At the same time, the melodies of opera and song and dance drama are completely different in rhythm and motif. The melody of "song and dance drama" is a pure song form corresponding to the rhythm of dance, whereas the melody of "opera" is...</p>
<p>When we appreciate the art of dance, we should pay special attention to the differences in their essence and form.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Snippets</h3>
<p>— Liu Xu</p>
<p>Miss Ginger Rogers has installed a television device on the roof of her house. On clear days, she can see the current conditions inside the MGM studios through the device. What a modern scientific toy!</p>
<p>These are some small news stories about silver stars that may be of interest to movie fans. The bottom of actress Joan Bennett's private swimming pool is made of glass. Johnny Weissmuller, the Tarzan actor, never misspoke a single line during filming. His current annual salary is $40,000. Greta Garbo is even more impressive. She has never misspoke a single word outside of the filming studio. Her annual salary is $400,000. Carole Lombard signs a check for $1,500 on the first of every month to provide her parents with living expenses. Jack Oakie, that mischievous star, used to be a notorious drunkard. But now he doesn't drink a drop of alcohol and drinks soda at most every day.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple recently received five little guests, who were the "Five Blessings Arriving at the Door" quintuplets. This can't be said to be a major event in film history. The conversation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shirley asked: "Hello, girls, are you all doing well?"</p>
<p>The second of the five girls replied on behalf of the group:</p>
<p>"Everything is good. We have nothing to complain about. Shirley, we already have $500,000 in the bank, and we have also signed a filming contract with 20th Century Fox."</p>
<p>Shirley said: "That's great. When you are as old as I am, you will know what this money is for."</p>
<p>Who would have thought that a generous and dignified female star would have such an embarrassing day? She is the famous Joan Crawford. She was driving her own car and passed a movie theater when she suddenly wanted to see the film being shown. She parked the car and wanted to go in, but her beloved dog "Po Jin" barked and made a lot of noise, insisting on going in with her and refusing to be locked in the car and suffocated. Perhaps he also has a habit of watching movies! Therefore, Miss Joan consulted with the doorman, but was ultimately told that dogs were not allowed to enter according to the regulations. Miss Joan then consulted with the manager, saying that "Po Jin" was very docile and would not make any noise. The manager, in order to please the big star, finally made a special concession. Who would have thought that Miss Joan's husband, Franchot Tone, played a key role in the film? When "Po Jin" saw his master appear on the screen, he suddenly barked. Joan Crawford hurriedly dragged the dog out and ran away.</p>
<p>Recently, a new film has been released in the film industry, titled "Mussolini's Private Life." The film faithfully records the Italian Prime Minister's family life, office appearance, and daily routines. I think that whether people have a liking for "Fascism" or not, they will be happy to see this documentary. The film was produced by the American company Hal Roach Studios. I'm afraid it will be difficult for this film to be screened publicly in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Tarzan's wife, Maureen O'Sullivan, is also a female star, but she has been unsuccessful on the silver screen for a long time. It is said that she has found a wealthy New York tycoon to back her up and is opening up another path. According to the tycoon, he will spare no expense to give Miss O'Sullivan an unprecedented performance opportunity, even better than the opportunities that Tarzan has had. Let's wait and see!</p>
<p>Oh no, oh no, Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone, the recently married couple, are also not getting along. Although they have not filed for divorce yet, they are already active separately. They go their separate ways every day, and they are no longer seen playing together sweetly. Moreover, they each bring opposite-sex friends to social events, and the couple must send invitations one day to eat together. They are truly respectful as guests and are becoming more and more distant. Perhaps it will not be long before it ends in tragedy.</p>

<p>The cannon controlling the horse and the patrolling river cannon facing the head-on cannon (horizontal chariot method) (Explanation) According to the situation described in the second game, a considerable momentum has been formed. However, ultimately, the black side moves first, and the initiative is on the black side. Therefore, advancing the pawn five spaces is still in the midst of an urgent attack. (The Mei manual says, "When successful, charge horizontally and vertically; prepare for rain before it comes"). Although the red side has a patrolling cannon to defend, the central route is ultimately empty. Advancing the knight four spaces is a precious move to supplement. Advancing the horse seven spaces has formed a dish-shaped head-pinning horse cannon formation. If one is slightly careless, one will be in trouble. Advancing the minister three spaces is also a move to supplement. Advancing the pawn three spaces, the front lines have engaged in close combat. If one considers the situation in this way, the opening of both sides has involved one attacking and one defending, seemingly without major mistakes. Advancing the cannon two spaces and then using the patrolling river cannon method to counter it, if the red side advances the pawn seven spaces, then it will become increasingly tight, gradually entering the middle game. In the middle game, the moves of both sides are different, with some advancing slowly and some advancing urgently. Therefore, the changes are not yet determined. As for the various changes, due to the space limitations of this journal, I apologize for not being able to publish them in detail. Dear Wen Hua, your submission is quite brilliant and will be published next Monday. Dear Zhang Ling, chariot eight moving horizontally, it is indeed possible to move. As for inquiring about the submission guidelines, this journal upholds the principle of researching chess art, and we will certainly welcome external submissions.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Gongli Troupe of the Old Capital (7) (3)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Gong Yunfu scolds Lu Wu but cannot do without Lu Wu</p>
<p>In drama, the old female role also occupies an important position. Roles like "Visiting the Mother," "Farewell to the Mother," "Beheading the Son at the Gate," "Rouge Tiger," "Xu Mu Scolding Cao," and "Ling Mu Committing Suicide with a Sword" are all ethical dramas about loyalty, filial piety, righteousness, and virtuous mothers educating their sons to achieve fame. Of course, they require old female role actors like Gong Yunfu and Jiao Fushan to portray these characters, instilling in the audience a sense of admiration for virtuous mothers. Even family historical dramas such as "Breaking the Empress Dowager," "Visiting the Cold Kiln of Filial Piety," "Filial Piety Moves Heaven," "Fishing for the Golden Turtle," "Instructing the Son on the Road," "Touring the Six Palaces," "Slippery Oil Mountain," and "Empress Dowager Resigning from Court" are all lengthy old female role dramas with elaborate singing and acting. Besides the singing skills of the male, painted-face, and female roles, they offer a different, exciting, and refreshing tune that can indeed refresh the spirit. Unfortunately, the theater authorities in Shanghai seem unable to pay attention to this. Therefore, although Beijing currently has two successors of the Xue school, Duo Kui and Woyun Jushi, the people of Shanghai do not pay any attention to their art, which is a pity. Li is good at singing, and Woyun is good at acting (since Si's voice has not been good recently, he has focused on imitating the acting, which is very similar to old Gong). The musicians they both use are Lu Yanting, the master of the old female role erhu. Because the method of playing the old female role erhu is different from that of the male, other, and female roles, there is no second old female role erhu musician besides Lu Wu. I am afraid that after Lu Wu, who is nearly seventy years old, dies, there will be no successors.</p>
<p>The old female role uses the natural voice, but the tune sung is a mixture of the female and male roles, with many high notes. The ups and downs, the contractions and releases, all take a unique and steep path. It seems impossible to find a flat avenue in the old female role's tune. Therefore, performers without strong vocal cords and sufficient breath should give up the idea of learning the old female role as soon as possible, otherwise they will waste their energy in vain, and their learning will be useless. Listen to old Gong's records. Which one is not in a key above the main key? Although he was over seventy years old, he reluctantly recorded a section of "Xu Mu Scolding Cao, One Two Six." The key was slightly lower, but in the subsequent "fast beat," the word "thief" in "this Cao thief" still used a high note. From this, one can see the skill of the old female role and his true artistic ability.</p>
