<p>倫敦　希特勒元首昨日下午三時、接見英國大使漢德森、消息靈通人土認爲此項談話極端重要、（廿六日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　駐德英大使漢德森今日挾希特勒之和平建議、由德返此、而與首相張伯倫外相哈立法克斯會談三小時、繼乃入白金漢宮覲見英王、內閣定今晚開全體會議考慮希特勒面授漢德森之建議、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦「每日快報」頃載稱、德元首希特勒昨日交付英國駐德大使漢德森爵士携歸倫敦之函、係向英國政府提出和平條件五項、計（一）英國倘允將凡爾賽和的所剩餘之「不平等條款」予以廢止、並交還德國舊日各殖民地、德國即願與之簽訂互不侵犯條的、（二）但澤自由市應歸還德國、（三）波蘭國得在但澤自由市亨有某種權利、以十年爲期、但以允許德國修築汽車路通過波蘭走廊爲交換條件、（四）德波兩國應舉行會議討論維持治安問題、並在波蘭國境內防止反德恐怖行動、（五）德波兩國爭議解決以後、德國可與波蘭國簽訂互不侵犯條約、並由德國保障波蘭國之邊界綫以十年爲期云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間各外國觀察家頃宣稱、墨索里尼首相曾向德國元首希特勒提議召集四强會議、幷未附以先決條件、但請在討論但澤問題覓致和平解決方案之前、勿以軍事行動加諸波蘭、據聞此議已爲希特勒元首所接受、墨索里尼首相之意、幷擬首先舉行四强會議、然後擴大範圍、聰任他國參加討論歐洲其他各項問題、此外德國駐義大使·義國駐德大使昨會在長途電話中傳達墨索里尼首相與希特勒元首雙方意見一層、極爲此間政界人士所注意、咸謂戰禍可望於最後時間予以消弭、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　各報頃評論歐洲時局、咸謂局勢極其嚴重、但叉發出暗示、謂現行危機巳有「一綫曙光」、使者報載稱、「浩刦並非無法挽救、新的希望、似非毫無根據、際此最後一分鐘、仍有進行談判之可能、可信常識已吿回復、墨索里尼首相與德國元首希特勒旣已迭次交換意見、齊亞諾外長與歐洲各國當局叉在外交上積極活動、不遺餘力、凡此業已透露曙光、英駐德大使漢德森携有希特勒元首之和平解決辦法、遄返倫敦、亦屬一種良好朕兆云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　半官機關斯丹芬尼通訊社頃發出消息稱、德元首希特勒與義首相墨索里尼、曾於昨日交換意見數决、德駐義大使麥剛森並於午後三時以希特勒兀首用長途電話傳來意見、轉吿墨索里尼首相、齊亞諾外長時亦在座、義國駐德大使阿多利哥旋又於午後六時以墨索里尼首相復文、通吿希特勒元首、迄至午後九時三十分、麥剛森大使又復以希特勒元首自電話中傳來意見、轉吿墨索里尼首相云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦駐德英大使漢特森昨又見希特勒、作挽回歐洲戰刦之二次努力、定今日飛回倫敦、向外相哈立法克斯有所報吿、此項消息已引起政界希望、以爲現有一種運用或可打破僵局而遏止自前傾向戰爭之劇烈趨勢、此次漢特森之返英、顯然挾有需要英國答復之提議或問題（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　再度向德呼籲和平　希望用談判方式解決爭端　波蘭總統已覆電表示接受</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統電達德義波蘭三國元首呼籲和平之後、波蘭國總統莫錫基業於昨日覆電應允照辦、其言略謂、「敬電奉悉、至爲欽佩、敝國政府向皆認爲直接談判、乃係解決國際爭議最適當之方式、以之施諸壤土相接之當事國、尤爲切合實際過去即已依照此一原則、與德蘇兩國簽訂互不侵犯條的、至以第三國出任調處而論、吾人亦認爲解決國際爭議之公允辦法、此次所由引起爭議之各項問題、雖不必一一道及、但有不能已於言者、此次之事、提出要求或請求他國讓步者並非敝國、尊電主張雙方在交涉期間、務當避去敵對行動、敵國自所贊司、但須對方亦能避去直接的或間接的敵對行動而後可、時至此日、全世界各國民族均皆切望普遍的綏靖、藉以重振固有之文明、閣下所發出之和平呼籲、倘能有禆於此種綏靖工作、實乃鄙人所企禱、莫錫基印」、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統接獲波蘭國總統莫錫基覆電之後、當即二决電達德兀首希特勒、略謂、「頃接波蘭國總統莫錫基來電、對於鄙人敬電所提出之直接談判與調解方式、明白表示贊同、閣下與貴國政府倘亦加以贊可、允以和平手段解決現行爭議、則千百萬人之生命、尙有保全之機會、全世界現代國家樹立和平關係從而獲致福利之希望、亦尙有實現之可能、全世界人士咸皆切盼貴國能繼波蘭國之後、表示贊同之意、用再電達、即祈亮察、羅斯福印」、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法總理重申　抵抗侵略決心　歐洲運命於波蘭問題　嚴詞斥責蘇聯背信行爲</h3>
<p>巴黎　達拉第總理於今晚九時、向全國人民發表廣播演說、其扼要一段、略謂余當盡人力之所及、以避免戰事、但若聽任强力方式肆行不巳、則全世界各民族之自由、終必爲所摧毀、法國民族亦難倖免、是以決當予以抵抗云、茲摘錄全文如决、總理首謂、「余生平爲人、乃國人所諗知、決當盡人力之所及以避免戰禍、此應爲國人所深信不疑者也、」國際各項問題均可經由談判途徑覓致解決、以但澤市問題而論、涉及波蘭國之自由與生存、足以引起歐洲戰事、「所謂波蘭國之自由與生存、即係三千五百萬生靈之自由與生存、歐洲其他各國人民之命運與相關連、法國人自非例外、吾國茲若坐視其他各國逐一屈服、則其結果所至、吾國不惟榮譽隨地、且以友邦淪亡而陷於孤立、亦即莫得出而援助矣、」吾國因欲組織和平陣綫、曾向各國凡願參加此項陣錢者接受約束、並與蘇聯進行談判、詎意該國「突然變更政策、」而與德國簽訂條約、且規避其歷來政策所產生之義務、「查德蘇兩國互助條約談判經過情形、旣曖昧不明、且適於此際發表、而其條文內容又復如此、實足使法國暨其友邦遭受侵略之危機爲之增加」、美國總統羅斯福比國王利奧波德三世先後呼籲和平、藹然仁者之言、莫名欽佩、法國茲特熱誠予以嚮應、所幸波蘭國態度旣屬鎭靜、又極勇敢、英法兩國決當保護各民族之自由獨立、暨全人類之榮譽、所望明哲精神卒能伸張、不幸而吾、余當申請男女公民咸以勇敢態度臨之、「吾儕法國人欲保持自由、生息於和平之中、但決不願爲暴力與不公道所驅策而屈從之也」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　衆院外交委員會、本日午後開會、當即就蘇德兩國簽訂互不侵犯條的事加以討論、各黨議員對於蘇聯、一致斥爲「賣友」咸謂此事徒足以增加戰爭爆發之可能性、旋即通過動議案表示抗議之意、惟共產黨各委員則以爲德蘇互不侵犯條的與和平陣綫組織事宜、並無牴觸之處、故拒不投票、衆院共產黨黨團亦於午後開會、秘書長多萊士當即發表演說、對於德蘇互不侵犯條的雖表示贊同之意、但謂德國倘賡續侵略、則共產黨員當與全國人民團結一致予以抵抗云、此外、社會黨黨團亦舉行會議、因共產黨贊成德蘇互不侵犯條的之故、議決不與該黨合作云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>比王和平呼籲　英美響應</h3>
<p>比京　英政府今日答復比王所發呼籲和平之通電謂、英國政府始終準備竭力襄助一切爭端、用自由談判方法之解決、若承認用武力或用武力威脅之解決、則徒摧毀欲建立國際和平秩序以擁護和平與公道而不破壞國家任何權利或獨立者之努力而已云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統頃鷺達比國王利奧波德三世、略謂「陛下前日以奧斯陸公的各簽字國名義發表宣言、呼籲和平、逖聽之餘、無任欣幸、陛下會希望他國元首亦能秉維持和平安全之願望、起而響應、鄙人用特聲明、敝國政府人民、實與陛下具有同感云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德總動員暫擱置　丹倫堡紀念取銷</h3>
<p>倫敦　據每日捷報載稱原定今晨三時執行之總動員、現已暫予擱置、同時希特勒擬於昨日發表紀念丹倫堡戰役勝利之演說、亦決定暫緩發表、據英國某閣員言時局已略見好轉、聞德國高級軍事當局對於武力行動意見不一、而羅斯福總統之和平呼籲、亦爲時局暫緩惡化之原因之一（二十六日美聯電）</p>
<p>柏林　宜傳已久之丹倫堡勝戰紀念儀式、原定明日舉行、今已取銷、此項消息、係昨夜德國官方通信社發出之公報所宜布者、據謂因時局嚴重、原定星期日在丹倫堡舉行之莊嚴儀式不擬舉行云、按此儀式係紀念一九一四年八月德軍在丹倫堡擊潰侵入東普魯士的俄軍之大勝利、希特勒本擬蒞會發言、昨晚希特勒因時局中之最近發展、猶正修改其凖備發表之演詞、可見紀念儀式之取銷、係臨時決定者、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>希特勒接見　四國大使　說明對波立塲　日本抗議賣友</h3>
<p>巴黎　法國方面消息、希特勒總理、昨與英法義日四國駐柏林大使會晤後、將歐洲和平希望、毀滅無餘、據稱、希特勒總理警吿民主國駐德大使、囑彼等患告本國政府、因波蘭之對德「暴行」、故德國實應採取「愼重」態度、其言詞中暗示德國之計劃、巳決定對波明白報復行動、關於希特勒與各大使談話另一報吿、希特勒表示德國必須「佔奪」波蘭、藉以終止德波糾紛、同時據報希特勒會提議召集世界會議、然並未表示該會是吾在波蘭問題解決之前或後舉行、（二十六日美聯電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首本日午後分別接見義日英法四國駐德大使時、聞曾聲明決意有所舉動、以保護波蘭境內日耳曼人、又謂此際局勢、譬如盛水之器、業巳滿盈、稍有波動水即溢出云、但此間政界人士均獲有一種印象、以爲德國或正設法促成一種會議、俾將但澤問題、作有利於德國之解決、此在外交界人士透露消息、則謂日本大使大島將軍會就德蘇兩國成立互不侵犯條的事、向希特勒元首提出抗議、並聲明該的第四條、在日本政府視之、實與反共產國際公的相抵觸云、（按第四條戰明任何集團、凡間接直接不利于簽字國一方者、其他一方不得出而參加、）（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>比京　德國大使布洛夫頃晋謁國王利奧波德三世、向之鄭重聲明、歐洲若果發生戰事、德國即願依照一九三七年十月十三日所提供之保證、不在任何方式之下、侵犯比國領完整、並尊重比國疆界但以比國嚴守中立爲其條件（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>海牙　德公使頃於午後晋謁威廉明女王、向之聲明、歐洲若果發生戰事、德國決不侵犯荷蘭國領土完整、幷願尊重其邊界綫、但以荷國嚴守中立爲條件、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　日本僑民定於日內乘坐專車離開德國、此外漢莎航空公司通往國外各航空綫所有飛機、頃巳決定停止飛行、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英工黨發表　吿德人書　輕啟戰禍災及己身　懸崖勒馬爲時非晚</h3>
<p>倫敦　英國工黨發表吿德國人民文、內言英法履行其諾言之決心、不因德蘇條約而稍懈、並謂「戰禍近在眉睫、如希特勒一旦攻擊波蘭、則不僅爲德國對波蘭之戰爭、且從是日起、將爲德國對英法之戰爭、君等政府不舉眞相以吿英國勞工向爲德國人民之友、故以眞相相吿、君等政府頃已與莫斯科締結互不侵犯條約、六年來君等所習聞爲君等最大仇敵之政府、今不崇朝而變爲君等歷史上友人矣、英國勞工今以極莊嚴態度相吿者、此約絕不影饗英法之地位、德國缺少原料與食物、如戰爭發生、將感覺覔取接濟之甚大困難、因英法將控制海上也、吾人未有摧毀德國人民之意、吾人始終爲君等之友、吾人今於尙未過晚之時、竭力以眞相相吿、和平可以保全、如此時保全和平、則可造成新歐洲之新世界」云、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<h3>國際局勢　未許樂觀　巴黎人士之觀察</h3>
<p>巴黎　政界人士頃宣稱、國際現行危機、雖有進行談判之可能、但和平解決希望極爲微薄、英法波蘭三國主管人士咸以爲各民治國決不因畏懼戰爭威脅之故、而聽任獨立自主之國受人宰割、以軸心方面而論、義國行動似甚積極、該國軍略地位極爲脆弱、自不願爲人作嫁、捲入戰爭漩渦、茲美國總統羅斯福旣向義國王要求調處、該國殆當以調人自居、但德元首希特勒究能接受墨索里尼首相意見而退讓至何種地步、尙不可知、至以義國主張召集四强會議而論、波蘭國旣不包括在內、則慕尼黑第二協定、意味濃厚、但此項計劃尙未完全打消、德國似亦不拒絕談判、觀於本月二十七日丹能堡城勝利紀念大會臨時作罷、即知希特勒元首不欲公開發表演說作繭自縛、而欲以較爲彈性之外交方式出之、此乃良好朕兆、特德國野心勃勃、並不以兼併但澤市爲止境、尙擬將該國暨前奧匈帝國在歐戰前所有領土、全部予以收回、此則可悲觀者也云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英準備組織　戰時內閣　羅致各派人物</h3>
<p>倫敦　各觀察家頃宜稱、戰事若果爆發、英國即當組織戰時內閣、舉凡保守黨要人之曾任閣員者、暨反對派各黨領袖均當予以羅致、並由張伯倫首相·哈里法克斯外相·西門財相·國防調整大臣卻德飛·反對派工黨領袖阿德里·自由黨領袖辛克萊·暨保守黨極右派領袖邱吉爾等七人、組織內閣小組會議、主持一切、此外前外相艾登亦有重入內閣之可能、（廿五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>英加緊實施　預防措置</h3>
<p>倫敦　官塲方面頃宣稱、內閣日前所議決各種預防措置、業巳迅速付諸實施、不論發生何種事故、均可應付裕如、惟後備兵應召入伍者、究有若干、官方拒不宣示、據一般人推測、英國本部陸軍員額、併現役與後備一併計算、共有八十萬名之多、今後仍當相度事勢、賡續提高、此外防空隊亦自六月份起、改爲戰時編制、最近兩日以來、又復賡續充實、各大城市平民疏散工作、正在籌備中、各小學校敎員、在假期中者、均經召回、籌辦學生疏散事宜、一俟接獲當局命令、即當實行、倫敦城中心區各商店與辦公室、均經裝置避炸彈設備、規模較大之商行、巳於去歲九月間、裝有避彈地窖、西區爲貴族化住宅與俱樂部薈萃之地、多數房屋窗際、均裝置鐵絲綱、以爲防禦彈片之用、本日樞密院在白金漢宮開會、又復決定加緊實施預防措置、其詳情將於明日發表、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英德两国與國際變局</h3>
<p>歐局和乎戰乎？和則解紛之方式如何，各國屈伸如何？戰則友敵之分野如何，兩方勝負如何？此當前之疑問，幾乎途人相執以求解答；誠以關係非僅歐洲一隅，影響遠及天下後世，宜人人注意之也。記者殆下愚，事迫眉睫，不惟不知所答；固知叱咤風雲之雄，眞知灼見之士，並世不可屈指數，然不知誰竟能答之。或斷然曰必戰，曰必不戰，竊又疑其言將無殊於賭徒之呼盧喝雉。夫何以不可捉摸？凡彼漩渦中之國家，各有其意願，各有其把握之政策；若循片面之意願與政策而得決定一切，則決定之下，當然無復疑問。疑問乃在各國之意願與政策相錯綜，旣不容片面決定，而其錯綜之反應則又有其無限之可能演變；惟可能之演變太多，而不能把握其必然，於是和戰間不容髮，而羣相盤旋於此一髮。故雙方相率而動員也，徵發也，撤退僑民也，變更商船之航綫也，聲色俱厲之演說，劍拔弩張之表現，無一而非大戰前夕之形態，然外交序慕絕未結束，如波蘭總統莫錫基氏電復美國總統羅斯福氏接受調解之建議，羅斯福氏之再電德國元首希特勒氏，英國駐德大使漢德森氏之齎希特勒氏函而飛返英倫，皆昨日事，是可覘知和平希望，亦不絕如縷。</p>
<p>現狀若斯，如何可以斷言於必戰必不戰，抑亦不必推論其戰不戰；斷言與推論，皆屬辭費。吾人所不厭辭費者，以爲蘇聯與德國之締結互不侵犯條的，不問其醞釀經過如何，不問其決策已閱幾時，然兩國鮮明表示其政策之澈底更張者，要自互不侵犯條的簽字公佈之日始。本報日前旣言之矣，以兩國政策之澈底更張，鮮明表示，斯各國有關於國際之一切，「無一而不須另行估價，另行考慮」；是在和戰間不容髮之今日，必爲另行估價考慮之最後機會無疑。以德國而論，當然夙有其意願與所把握之政策，而其毅然與蘇聯締結互不侵犯條的，亦必成竹在胸；然條的之內容，締的時與蘇聯談判所樹立之默契，締的後精神與事實兩方面所得國際之反應，不盡在德國意願與所把握之政策之中者也。例如德外長里賓特洛浦以爲蘇德條的必予蘇日關係與德日睦誼以良好影響，且以爲德國得爲蘇日締結互不侵犯條的之媒介；詎知日本大憤，外則對德抗議，責爲賣友，內則廢棄其預定之對歐方案，而另行草擬新方案。如此反應，豈所預料？然則德國於與蘇締的之後，不應針對現實，另行沽價，另行考慮乎？竊以爲德國所亟須另行沽價與考慮者二：（一）德國對付波蘭，對付但澤自由市，甚應變更其半年來之種種態度與方式，獲致解決懸案之圓滿方案；蓋德國聲勢，在主觀則旣非昔比，在客觀亦衆所共許，自不妨放棄原來之態度與方式也。（二）德國對於遠東，甚應變其袒日抑華之政策；蓋往日所需於日本者，乃爲吶喊鼓噪，俾有裨補於德國之在歐行爲；今日需要旣殊，而日本之不願復爲德用，亦無可諱；然則德國固應認定中國爲夙相親和之良好主顧，即與中國修復夙昔之睦誼，保持此豐厚偉大之市塲。况英德兩國之齟齬，固別有所在而不在中國；亦即在遠東方面，以中國爲中心，形成中英，中蘇，中德，之多角和諧，實屬並行而不悖者也。</p>
<p>以英國而論，凡所遭遇，至堪同情；彼在蘇德携手之後，當然有修正轉變其政策之必要。所謂修正與轉變，宜非放棄其義務之謂；例如英波盟的，昨告完成，此爲英國決心踐行義務之强有力表示。雖然，英波締盟之主旨，要在互助而兩全；求互助與兩全之至善，要在顧此顧彼，相諒相成；英國爲波蘭計，波蘭亦應爲英國計焉。循是言之，英波固應審察演變之環境，體認艱難之現實，考慮兩國所必爭之標準，是吾今昔應有所不同，而共謀萬全之計。竊意英國所應注意者，此其一。英國主要之命脈在海外，海外之第一壁壘，第一勁敵，俱在遠東。第一壁壘，非所必保乎？第一勁敵，非所必防乎？共保遠東壁壘，共防遠東勁敵者，中國應爲首選。往者，英國雖無求於歐大陸，而輒以助成歐大陸之安定爲急務；顧乃不惟勞而無功，抑且深人漩渦；然則於此國際情勢劇變之餘，英國對於歐大陸、除踐行萬分必要之義務之外，不應廢然知返，自此重視海外命脈，强化中英關係乎？竊意英國所應注意者，此其二。英德兩國若此，他國對於國際之一切，應及時另行估價，另行攷慮，固相似也。</p>

<h3>敎部訂頒　敎師節紀念辦法</h3>
<p>重慶二十六日電　中央前決定八月二十七日爲敎師節後、敎部爲鼓勵敎師服務精神、融洽師生情感、並喚起社會尊敬敎師、訂定敎師節紀念辦法、茲經探誌如次、（甲）各級敎育行政機關、舉行左列各項、（子）表揚著有勞績之優良敎師、（敎育部以全國爲範圍、省市縣敎育行政機關以各該省市縣爲範圍、）（丑）提倡改善小學敎師待遇、（寅）發表獎學金得獎學生之名單、（專科以上學校及國立各中等學校得獎學生、由敎部發表、省市縣立及私立中等學校暨省市立小學得獎學生、分別由省市敎育行政機關發表、）公立（省市立除外）及私立小學得獎學生分別由縣市敎育行政機關發表、（卯）其他、（如招待各校敎師代表、或慰勞谷校敎師等、由各機關臨時酌定、）（乙）各級學校單獨或一地方聯合舉行左列各項之一部或全部、（子）紀念會儀式秩序單、（從略）（丑）講演孔子及歷代師儒之言行或關於敎育之舉術講演、（寅）懇親會、（卯）敎師游藝會、（辰）成績展覽會、（己）其他、（如發行特刊等、由各校或各地方臨時酌定、）（丙）社會及學生家長與敎師、舉行左列各項、（子）各報應於是日著論闡揚孔子之言行、並鼓勵社會尊師崇道、（丑）中等以上學校學生家長、及學生應向敎師祝賀健康、或致謝函、（寅）小學學生家長、及學生、應於是日至敎師家祝賀健康、（卯）敎師間得於是日彼此祝賀、</p>
<h3>第一屆國定敎師節的特殊意義</h3>
<p>— 盧冠六</p>
<p>敎師節的提倡、巳經有好幾年的歷史了、可是幾年來總是敎師們的自拉自唱、國家當局旣沒有正式的承認、社會人士也沒有特別的重視、每年到了這一天、大家循例紀念、或是放假一天、或是州聚餐一次、糊裏糊塗的便一次一次的渡過去了、</p>
<p>今年的敎師節、本來已經過去了、但是據報上的記戰、敎師節已經由中央政府規定在孔誕日舉行、這的確是一個値得注意的消息、我們决不能說這是一件普通的事情、我們必須認識它所包含的特殊重大的意義、第一個問題浮在我們心頭的、就是提唱了多年的敎師節、從沒有邀過當局的核准、何以在這困難股重的今日、中央當局在抗建工作萬分忙迫之中、反而注意到敎師節的推行、這是什麽原因呢、答復是因爲政府對於敎師的重視、現在我們正常努力復興的時候、敎師的責任、無疑的是萬分重大、政府的規定敎師節、就是要我們做教師的認識自己的責任的重大、大家起來負起敎育國民、振奮良心、領導社會的重任、</p>
<p>第二個問題、浮在我們心頭的、就是敎師節爲什麽要規定在孔誕日舉行、答復是孔子是我國歷史上最大的敎育家、他的言行、影響於社會國家的很是遠大、現在把敎師節定在這一天、一方面使社會人士、從孔子地位的崇高、聯想到敎師的可以尊敬、一方面使敎師們不要輕視自己的職業、能够以孔子做模楷、來學習孔子的好行爲、孔子已經是二千多年以前的人、他的思想和學說、也自有他社會的背景、我們生在二十世紀科學昌明的時代、應該更有新的思想新的道德這話當然是不錯的、可是孔子的好道德、還有許多值得我們模仿的地方、尤其是現在上海敎育界、至少應該學習他下列的幾項優點第一要學孔子的明辨是非疾惡如仇孔子的學說是從一個人的立身做起、做到治國平天下、他以爲一個人修身的方法是正心誠意、他以爲一個心不正意不誠的人是一個沒有人格的人、沒有人格的人、是他所深惡痛絕的、因爲他疾惡如仇、所以他做魯司寇不到七天、便動手殺了一個亂政大夫少正卯、他殺少正卯的罪狀、是因為他聚衆結社、鼓吹邪說、淆亂是非、所以他便絕不姑息的把少正卯殺掉了、他又作春秋褒善貶惡、義正辭嚴、使一般沒有人格的亂臣賊子、知所戒懼、他這種是非嚴正、嫉惡如仇的大無畏精神、是我們應該效法的、</p>
<p>第二是學孔子的熱心敎育肯負責任孔子因爲那時的環境所迫、不能實行他的志願、因此他就專心講學、敎授生徒、他講學的要點、也注意個人人格的修養、他有熱心敎育的精神、所謂「學不厭誨不倦」、他又能因材施敎、做着普及敎育的工作、所以他說、「有敎無類」、並且他不獨敎學生學習、還能敎學生實行、因爲他這樣的熱心敎誨、所以弟子三千餘人、後來成名的很多、我們負敎育次代國民之責的人、應該學習孔子的榜樣、確立自己高尙的人格、爲靑年學生的表率、並且在學生們天眞的頭腦裏、播種着正義的種籽才好、</p>
<p>第三要學孔子的刻苦生活嚴予操守孔子把讀書人稱爲士和君子、士的標準、是要有氣節、有材幹、尤其是要有操守、所以他說、「不義而富且貴、於我如浮雲」、他的學生子張也說、「士見危授命、見得思義」、他又把君子的意義定爲「富貴不能淫、貧賤不能移、威武不能屈」、並目他不獨能够這樣的敎學生、他自己也的確能够這樣做的、當他出遊時、走到陳蔡之間、因爲旅費缺乏、好幾天斷了糧、同行的人都怨恨起來、他說、「我們遇着窮困的日子、也要能够自守、不能因爲窮困而自暴自棄」、現在一般的敎師、都是處於米珠薪桂、收入微薄、生活日趨窮困的時候、他這種刻苦自勵的生活、的確是値得我們去模仿的、</p>
<p>但是我們不只是學習孔子的一切就算好了、我們要知道現在的時代、已和幾千年以前大不相同、以前忠君的觀念、巳須代之以愛國的工作、以前個人的學說、更須代之以集體的行動、我們要洞察這偉大時代給予我們的使命、和我們國家民族的前途、肩負起每個黃帝的子孫、所應負的責任、所以我們在這第一屆國定敎師節之前、除對於個人的修養、注意勉勵、個人的意志、設法堅定外、還要能够積極團結、使大家參加組織的生活、才能共同趨向於光明的前途、</p>

<h3>滬郊將有反掃蕩戰　華軍已縝密配備　正規軍開駐上松青各縣　江南游擊區準備機動戰</h3>
<p>中央對於江南游擊區各縣現正積極調集大量正規部隊、計劃大規模之機動戰爭、以謀收復失地之準備、允因鑒於滬郊各縣雜色部隊情形紊亂、亟需加以整理、業由軍委會令由劉建緒將軍指派新編三十師師長張鑾基氏負責整理、聞將淞滬近郊各縣劃爲四大區、分設上海市·上松靑·奉南川·太嘉寶·等、設置富具軍事才充任各該縣區軍事特派員、分赴各地切實編訓、以期造就堅强勁旅、發揮反掃蕩之游擊戰爭、由三十師縝密配備、已調遣第八十八團田岫山部全部、開駐上松靑各縣、外傳三十三三十四師開滬、恐即此誤、</p>
<p>南滙日軍　要求緩兵侵入南城及大團之日軍小川部隊、因該處並無公路綫、行軍困難、四郊均被游擊隊控制、退路有被截斷之虞、故日軍方面、放出和平空氣、要求游擊隊不再進行軍事、並許其回駐南滙城及大團鎭、照常征收各項國稅、雙方不得再行攻擊、等於訂一不侵犯條的、華軍指揮于陶生等、認爲此係一種緩兵之計、置諸不理、並進行大規模之包圍戰術、</p>

<p>據青浦來人談、滬靑公路上近有連續之游擊戰、日軍增援頗多、希圖遂其所謂掃蕩計劃、但游擊隊熟識路徑、日軍無從捉摸、故此决進兵計劃、圖將華軍驅至松靑公路以西一帶、完全失敗、</p>
<p>日海軍已　登岸搜查滬閔南柘路上海中學北橋鎭、及滬杭鐵路之龍華·梅隴·莘莊·等鎭、本駐日軍祇十餘名、至數十名、現因各地游擊隊聲勢活躍、故日方對於防範、漸行嚴密、昨據由閔行來滬者云、沿途所駐日軍、均見加增、在沿浦鎭市派有崗兵、並由日艦海軍登岸搜查、現顓橋莘莊一帶、亦提早戒嚴、以防游擊隊襲擊日司令部、</p>

<h3>美國名作家萊滬　對白渡橋印象　華人被迫低首寄以感慨　謂若係美人必終身懷恨</h3>

<p>小作勾留　定期反美</p>
<p>卡氏在日本時、絕未試圖感化日人、據稱、渠不諳日語、對此無能爲力、卡氏叉稱、渠經日本來中國、所見戰爭證跡不多、認爲此行遠較渠乘汽車自紐約至芝加哥爲安全、且怡然自適、渠留滬埠、擬略購物品及觀光、然後於星期三日買掉返芝加哥、</p>
<p>德蘇簽約　拒不批評記者叩以德蘇簽訂互不侵犯條的事、卡氏拒不批評、據稱、渠自自覺不適於談論諸國關係、渠自己有若干小問題、且不知如何解決、故何能對此世界大事發表意見、以此等問題相叩、渠殊覺榮幸、然渠認爲新聞記者有資格談論此等事件、遠勝於渠、</p>

<p>新書成功　殊感驚異第三、渠會費十五年、硏究人類關係、著有「如何獲友與感化他人」一書、此書之成功、渠實感驚異、因據卡氏意見、渠著此書之努力、較遜於林肯傳記也、惟他人對該書感覺興趣、是爲該書爭相傳誦之良好理由、卡氏研究當衆發言之結果、刻擬另著「如何發展目信與克服恐懼」一書、惟渠著書、恒覺難以起筆、故不能言定出版日期、</p>

<p>各輪暫泊　大沽天津</p>

<p>滬津航線　將暫停航</p>
<p>據航業界表示、現因天津水勢暴漲無已、各輪無法靠埠卸貨、且滯留大沽或天津損失頗鉅、故如水勢不退、則各輪或將被迫暫行停駛改航他錢、俟水勢退去後、再行復航、但聞太古洋行之順天盛京輪、或仍將開航、</p>

<p>現任時報營業部長之松江人王季魯、年五十三歲、住法租界辣斐德路甘世東路口一二三二弄（即頴邨）十二號、王因在時報收入極微、故經濟至爲不裕、平時出入、每安步當車、惟有時則由報館車輛迎送、</p>
<p>安步當車　弄口遇狙</p>
<p>昨晨王早餐後、即披深灰色綢長衫、鼻架白金邊品鏡、因其體格肥胖、天氣炎熱、故禿頭未戴帽、綏步出弄、初不料此時已有人豫伏於該處、凖備演此一幕可怖之血案矣、</p>
<p>發搶三響　頸中一彈</p>
<p>迨王出弄、東行未幾武、正行至辣斐德路A字一二二二號辣斐洗染商店門口、而欲路入黃永泰國藥號之牆界時、突於身后躍出短衣暴徒一名、出槍向王連發三彈、王猝不及防、第一彈即被擊中左後頸、因相離甚近、故彈力極猛、逕穿左鼻邊面部而出、</p>
<p>流彈穿門　傷及行人</p>
<p>王中彈時、神智尙淸、情知不妙、亟向辣斐洗染店內逃避、開槍男子、見王避入、又追上續發兩彈、一彈洞穿該店玻璃門、一彈則飛往他處、擊傷各人拔佳鞋店爲夥之何鴻亮（三十一歲）住該路福興坊十九號）腿部、開槍男子見目的既達、乃捨王混入人羣中而逸、因斯時正小菜塲上市之際也、</p>
<p>逃入店內　經送醫院</p>
<p>王逃入該店後、即遷避入店堂後之燙衣間、血流如注、店夥多人、遂大驚而逃、一面由一夥出警笛在吹、迨捕房得訊趕至、則燙衣間內鮮血滿地、作台板上燙妥之衣服多件、上亦遍沾血液、乃即將王及流彈所傷行人車送廣慈醫院、惟此時王家中雖近在咫尺、但不知王巳被人槍擊於途也、</p>
<p>事前並未　接得警告王傷雖重、經醫療治後、經過尙佳、且因子彈巳出、生命或可無虞、王家中人口極簡單、僅王妻及子女三人、傭婦一人而已、復據法捕房宣佈、開槍時流彈受傷者、除路人何鴻亮外、尙有浦東十五歲之孩童沈根新傷頭部、查王此决突遭狙擊事前並未接得任何警吿、現捕房正嚴查原因中云、</p>

<h3>人心終虛　金市成虎頭蛇尾</h3>
<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗盤市况、驚風駭浪、仍處於靈盪不定中始飛漲、繼狂跌、後趨徘徊之勢、各方人心忐忑、市態雜亂無章、初因美滙緊縮、英純金在漲二先令有奇、於有求無供狀况下、晨開竟高達四千二百五十元、後聞美滙隨英金一致趨鬆、且客帮袖手旁觀、錢兌業與銀樓帮相率傾出、多方斬結益切、價竟一蹶不振直傾跌至四千元大關口、幸被限價買戶所阻、且有不少對歐局樂觀者之買戶故後得盤旋於四千零五十元左右、終再續跌一百十元、下午例假、聞塲外巳做高至四千零九十元、上半日交易共八九百兩、首飾金亦始高、繼低、後回、軋小五元、掛四百十元、關金與中英純金等、將去年德捷緊張時之驚人漲風、突又出現於當日、又今日因孔子誕辰休業、但適逢星期、故乃明日週一補假一天、</p>
<p>烚赤震盪不定　暴落一百十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞英純金猛漲二先令有奇、致人心因之激動、一時買氣頗濃、售者不前、開市竟在抬一百十五元、某銀號進銀樓帮十兩、價四千二百五十元、爲當日高峯、開後內聞外滙經港電等拋塞後、趨勢頗鬆、人心急轉直下、某金號及錢兌業等競相猛塞、兼銀樓帮亦頻來塞出、加以客帮納胃淡薄、迨至十時後價竟猛撳二百五十元、錢兌業售予金號二十兩價四千元爲當日低盤、後聞外滙略轉軟化、致賣風頓戢、某錢兌業代富商力吸二百餘兩、價遂不久回高七十元、金號互做三十兩、價爲四千零七十元、時聞外滙復趨鬆動、某金號雖力進百餘兩、奈銀樓帮與散戶吐售頗殷、致一度又降低至四千零三十元、後證券帮與錢兌業吸進數十兩、價竟拉抬至四千零六十元、將近午刻、因某錢兌業代門市散戶吐售、且外滙仍帶鬆硬、遂又降落三十五元、金號賣予錢兌業十兩、爲四千零二十五元、作午收價、結果比上日又暴落一百十元、半天二百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價較烚赤高十元、現樓金照掛牌金低六十五元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金始高終低　改懸四百十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十五元、迨至九時三十五分、掛高十元、逾五分後即回落五元、九時四十五分叉回小五元、九時五十分掛小五元、十時許又掛低五元、下午三時零五分回高五元、結果掛小五元、計大同行改懸四百十元、新同行爲四百零八元、收進須减低二十允光景、</p>
<p>英純金竟飛騰　二先令一便士</p>
<p>二十五日倫敦電、英純金囚歐局危急、致前在德捷緊張時之驚人買風、又現於今日、英鎊疲軟不振、致每盎斯竟飛漲二先令一辨士有奇、升至七鎊十先令六辨士新高價、本市中央銀行掛牌海關金亦起巨波、竟猛漲三分半、達二元四角二分九釐、上海標凖標金價飛上十六元九角、達一千二百二十三元八角、中國純金收買價、升至一千二百二十八元五角云、</p>
<h3>英澳金票慘落　美票獨昂</h3>
<p>咋日外幣、因外匯趨鬆、烚赤先堅後疲、結果下跌甚烈、英美金鎊影響下降、實際供給稀少、需要甚股、時局擾攘中硬幣終佔優勝、英金票下降猛烈、往日收藏者、紛紛供塞降達五十六元、甚形虛弱、美金票各國歡迎、需要最殷、市價獨升、香港法郞等票、巳隨時局而趨軟弱、澳金票下降甚慘、跌至三十九元、安南斐律濱等票、未受影響、市况穩定、日金票供求尙盛、市况趨堅、晚市爲一元一角七分、朝鮮票穩定、仍爲一元零二分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降一元、英金票降六元八角、美金票升二角五分、香港票降二角九分、法郞票降一分五厘、新加坡票降四角、荷蘭票降五角、羅比票降六角、德金票降一角、澳金票降十元、其他各幣未史、</p>
<h3>貼現軋低五元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、初平後跌、每千元上午在一百八十五元左右、下午因外匯現金等市例假、現鈔需求較少、故見步低至一百八十元、比前日軋低五元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均仍掛一角八分云、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債新空已少</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况、因和平空氣、漸見流通、人心稍有聞鷄起舞之象、公債因此亦漸蘇醒、稍稍有生氣、隔日近暮時、丙種行市已經做過四十三元二三角、惟以浮多尙夥、逢高脫手、故昨晨開市初做三元一角、旋即下瀉、幾及一元、但新空已極爲稀少、人心至少因德蘇國交之變動奇突、咸將深切注意於公債之變動、自六月十九日及二十二日停止還本付息謠言、及銀行限制提存之兩重打擊後、兩月來債市始終在跌落十餘元之低價下、沉淪不起、當此世界各國驟起、先後截然不同之重大轉變後、中日問題或將因之急轉直下、市塲一般人心已隨之移轉目光矣、昨日交易以買戶比較踴躍、潤利鴻康高價吸收、永康進胃亦不弱、天生及永豐以及一般散戶多頭出籠、市價高而復低、結果仍好起三五角、成交總數共計的七十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股五十股、價爲六元一角、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報吿云、市况滯呆、價格未更、倫敦橡皮存底、本週預測减少四千一百噸、倫敦英商遠東各公司股票、本月二十五（週五）掛牌行市、漲跌互見、麥加利銀行股微跌二先令六辨士、價爲六鎊正、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股升四鎊半、又香港註冊股升二鎊半、價均爲七十鎊、以上三種均屬有行無市、古拉客林傍橡皮股升九辦士、價爲十五先令九辦士、其餘均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債、本月二十五日（週五）掛牌行市、仍吿平穩不動、</p>
<h3>海味　金山尾底存將馨</h3>
<p>金山蝦尾、來源不繼、致此間底存巳將吿罄、而各帮動辦不報、市價乃扶搖直上、最近開過二百七十五元、刻市叉復高唱三百元矣、</p>
<h3>紗花　新買戶奇缺　紗價重行回挫　雙馬天女各跌十五元</h3>
<p>七日狂漲之紗市、昨則復入平靜之途、因一部份多頭了結、略見回拌、然下降趨勢益覺和緩、一部份心理謂原料價格仍無鬆落之望、故一般實力充足者、囤藏之紗、始終無放棄之念、市態未見十分動搖也、不過港海嚴密戒備、日艦集精、香港帮採辦受其打擊矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開氣勢和平、因上日漲力過勁、而無其他變遷、市塲中新買者忽見减色、開價跌一二十元之鉅、二十支變馬棧單價爲六百二十五元、現貨價爲七百元、少頃又跌五元、未幾多說匯票開出美金改縮、人氣頓形緊俏、回升十元、雙馬棧單價爲六百三十元、現貨價爲七百十元、旋以美金雖縮、而先令放長、收盤又轉軟弱、查半日成交統計一千〇十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十五元、雙地球跌十九元、天女跌十五元、明日出口有棉紗三十件運靑島、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港　二八〇　同行四九五</p>
<p>內地　二三五　統計一、〇一〇</p>
<p>又本月二十七日爲孔子誕辰紀念、適逢星期日、自二十八日星期一補假、現紗市塲停市一天、銀錢業聞亦停市一天云、</p>
<h3>現棉隻包未聞做開</h3>
<p>中外現棉交易、頓吿絕跡、隻包未曾成交、蓋因各廠存棉濃厚、對於原料一時不必採辦需要、昨雖紗市開價平平、外匯放長、進胃仍淡薄不堪、但市價始終不鬆、依然堅定、故而廠商購辦力量、異常脆弱、同業互做賣買、亦入於停頓之途、蘇北來源又見暢達、計到通州花五百八十四包、又北沙來四十五件、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉義烏、日來因海外棉市之飛漲、運棉來華之船隻、已日趨减少、滬上存底微薄、各同業由此均不擬出雋、故日來交易淸淡、然售價一項、始終不願放鬆也、至於廠方、朋因局勢不定、買意殊爲鬆懈也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盤、即呈疲乏之狀、投機者又在市拋賣、海外棉商追踪而來、市價漸吿下沉、結果收盤較上日跌八至十磅音、利物浦棉市因歐洲危急之故、昨日又猛漲二十八辦士、印度亦因英美滙兌之故猛縮、棉市連同預測猛漲六羅比餘、埃及棉市亦漲二十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　客秈貶價　江北新秈源源來　粳米小後又回平</h3>
<p>杜粳　河下共到松江南港貨三十六艘、然以種種關係、祇能抵達浦東楊家波及東昌路、車輪包子到新陳粳尖二千餘包、早市開手形勢仍疲、新陳尖甩落一二元不等、跌後雖會引起本街動辦、但行情仍難提高、如厚粳以多方被阻、市貨無多、呈平定之局、結果計高鍚粳做開三十八元半至三十八元、蘇同三崑粳十七元、江下早晚稻三十五元半至三十五元、原包三十七元至三十六元七八角、陳蕪尖三十三元半至三十二元、新尖三十二元半、决之三十一兀、成交共計四千六百餘包、變元未見做開、</p>
<p>客秈　昨到頭仍旺、江北京蕪各地續到三四千包、而江北新秈父將源源裝來、故人心回平、貨方莫不貶價求脫、故新秈祇開三十三元至三十一元、比之前市三十四五元、較小一二元不等、京蕪秈亦帶小元許、</p>
<p>洋米　新交易沉寂、現貨亦未售開、惟傳金融界在匯水伸長時、曾定新西貢一千噸、合價祇三十二三元、將於月初到申云、</p>
<h3>回籠粉需要减　小麥亦少精彩</h3>
<p>麵粉續告平軟、廠盤雖未更動、而回籠貨售價、則已步鬆、良以各廠對於本街實銷大戶、均能盡量供給、隨時車送、故本街巳不再需要回籠貨、且北洋帮以天津大水、進胃頗靜、南洋帮則以時局關係、更鮮搬運、由是回籠貨乒船牌等價已步跌至四角半及三角半，洋粉亦降角許、昨有客帮做開、價祇六元四角半、</p>
<p>小麥來源、逐步增旺、京籲蘇錫等處、均有大額　滬、蓋自麥價漲至十元以來、經營小麥者，日見衆多故也、更以國際情勢變化莫測、故囤戶進辦、亦不若前兩日之旺、市面遂少精彩、統由僅由福阜兩廠辦去蘇州·管店·無錫·丹陽·常州·奔牛·鎭江·南京等麥共一萬二千包、高貨價仍能勉强定立、惟中决貨已見貶小一二角囤戶方面則未做開、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油價步降</h3>
<p>豆油市價一度暴落後、曾復趨上騰、二日來世界大局緊張、市塲中投機稍形斂跡、辦胃亦不過貪、昨日市氣鬆動、行情比上日之最高便跌去一元外、潛勢有導入正軌之狀、共計做開天津桶豆油二十桶、價爲五十五元五角、大連桶油三十桶、價亦開五十五元五角、又神戶來連油一百八十桶、價自五十八元、頻跌至五十七元一角、去路均爲本街、花生油妥開天津桶油一百桶、價爲七十二元、由本街巷帮分去云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經祇美莊動辦</h3>
<p>本埠絲市、昨甚鮮生氣、蓋歐局前途正難逆料、洋行復接總行電報、對於倫敦里昂之解貨、因時局關係、暫時一概停裝、故一般洋行咸停購、歐銷生絲、美莊洋行昨僅做開三十担、七八分白廠三九〇〇元、無均度、次B級三六〇〇元、廠商雖有售意、但心旌搖搖、均暫觀望、故發電大見减少、</p>
<p>紐約現貨、昨未更動、近期小五分、遠期跌五元、橫濱現貨跌十元、遠期跌五元、國外交易、亦欠緊張、</p>
<h3>糖市　劃盤漲勢加厲</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電無甚上落、十二月份六先令三辦士半、明年三月及六月份均六先令四辦士、公會劃價、續見上展、現貨漲一元四角、本棧四十二元三角、外棧四十一元半、後又升至四十二元、轉口貨初爲三十三元半、旋升三十四元、太古車白亦升元半至一元八角、西棧爲四十五元四角至四十六元、東棧四十五元二角至四十五元八角、西棧CW嘜四十五元七角、CX嘜四十五元四角、DV嘜四十五元、HX嘜四十四元八角、H嘜車亦升一元、爲三十元、荷赤現貨三十九元、升二元、轉口三十二元半、升一元九角、本綿白升一元、振記一號四十二元、本一號冰升二元、爲四十七元半、晶明冰四十九元、國糖東鄉赤漲三元許、以三十五元半、開出一百二十五包、又特高一百八十四元、三十六元、特高大宮粉百餘包、開五十三元四角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　囤戶出籠　白貨重又慘跌</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨外匯忽緊忽弛、人心忐忑、囤戶出籠、市盤又轉下游、怡和十六磅變象粗布散額仍祗售二十元、數額多者尙可做小、白貨粗布·細布·紋跌一角至五角、重回至二十四日價格、漂染布價亦回軟、本街成交粗布·色布·漂布·絨布·一百餘件、甬帮辦色布·綫呢·花絨·粗布六七十件、贛帮辦細布、色布一千餘疋、滇粵亦續有添辦、國外南洋帮新加坡等地辦漂布·漂斜·印花貨色布三千數百疋、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>昨白貨、因客員呆滯、賣風又熾、本街染廠及批發莊雖有小額添辦、但成交細布鈿斜總計不滿五百件、細布每疋回跌二角半至五角、細斜亦降二三角、龍頭細布現貨售開十七元八角半、陽鶴細布祇十六元七角半、陽鶴細斜低盤已售過十穴元五六角、同業手貨皆願鬆售、形勢趨疲、二十八日疋頭五十件運烟台、</p>
<h3>南北冀　龍口粉　開新高價</h3>
<p>龍口粉近來到貨仍少、市勢異常堅緊、昨聞客貨開出三十餘件、竟達一百十五元、行盤售一百十六元、以貨稀價雖奇昂、去胃依然活潑云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　開平煤新到　三千餘噸</h3>
<p>開平烟煤、前因來源稀少、本街需求爽健、致貨被搜一空、近新貨絡繹有到、日昨馬勒輪又裝來開平統煤三千五百餘噸、由義泰興經理售出、碼頭排車、統煤每噸五十八元、篩塊六十三元、聞巳銷去千餘噸云、</p>

<h3>尊敬你的教師</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>今天，是敎育部通令更改的第一個敎師節日·本來今天是孔子誕辰紀念，敎育部把敎師節改在今天，實在有着重大的意義。記得以前，孩子上學的時候，要向着孔子的聖像弄禱，或是向着「天地君親師」的神位拜　，這是尊敬師長的表示。後來，這些禮節，跟着學制的更動，漸漸廢止了。學生對於師長，也漸漸地冷淡下去。師生的關係，彷彿是不大爲人們所注意。但是，小朋友們如果把你們的師長，設身處地的思考一下，覺得敎師眞是社會上最値得尊敬的一個人。</p>
<p>敎師爲了學生，犧牲他畢生的一切；他僅僅拿了些微的報酬，終日辛勤地爲學生服務着，任何氣惱，他必須忍受下來，任何艱難，他必須担負下來。許多頑劣不肯從敎訓的孩子們，敎師要以最大的忍耐去敎導他們，去感動他們，使他們將來能够生活，能够負起社會中的工作。他們爲了國民的基礎敎育，他們爲了民族精神，他們爲了敎育國家未來的主人翁，艱苦地執行着他們的任務，而他們的報酬，叉是何等的低微。小朋友們，你們能不敬重老師嗎？</p>
<p>是的，有些時候你們的敎師，因爲精神上，物質上感受着刺激，他對你的態度，難免使你不高興，但是，小朋友們，這種情形，你也應該原諒敎師們的。無論那一個敎師，他的苦悶的時候，總要比快樂的時候多。你總明白，同學中果然有許多有情義的學生，感激着敎師爲學生們努力的精神。但是，也有不知好歹的孩子，他們孤負着老師的和氣，他們看輕敎師工作的，這樣怎能不使敎師們感覺怨憤呢！親愛的小朋友，在廣西，他們巳在實行尊敬敎師的信的了。我在今天的敎師節日，也願拉出「尊敬老師」的口號，和小朋友共勉。以從前尊敬孔聖的精神和態度，來尊敬老師！</p>
<p>亞米契斯在名著愛的敎育中，告訴小朋友們說；除了父親的名字以外，最應該尊敬的，就是老師的名字。再請大家反省一下，小朋友們有沒有過，輕蔑你的老師的心理和態度？</p>
<h3>偉大的孔子</h3>
<p>— 王修和</p>
<p>孔子，是我國古代的大學問家，也是東方的大學問家，和西方的蘇格拉底，柏拉圖，亞里斯多德，同爲世人景仰的大名鼎鼎的學者。他生於周靈王二十一年十月庚子日，（民國紀元前二千四百六十二年八月二十七日）死於周敬王四十一年四月乙丑日，（民國紀元前二千三百九十年，）年七十三歲。</p>
<p>孔子幼時，最喜陳列祭器，演習祭祀儀式。少年時，會到周王室從老子研究古時禮儀，叉到齊國從太師學習古樂。一生惟有努力學問。他說：「朝聞道，夕死可矣。」「三人行，則必有我師。」由此可見他求學的認眞了。</p>
<p>他不但是一個學問家，同時還是實際的政治家和敎育家。定公十年的時候，曾充當魯國的司寇官。這年，魯定公和齊景公的定在夾谷（今山東萊蕪縣）會盟。定公啟行時，孔子便對定公說：「臣聞有文事者，必有武備；有武事者，必有文備。古者，諸侯出疆，必具官以從，請具左右司馬。」定公很以爲然，便呌孔子帶兵隨行。會見時，齊使萊人出來奏樂，宮女出來歌舞，孔子嚴詞止之，爲魯國爭得不少體面。（兩國會盟，彼此地位相等，如果齊使萊人奏舞，那末齊變主而魯成從者了。這樣，豈不大失體面。）</p>
<p>越四年，孔子代理宰相職權，三月之後，國家大治，齊人大懼，遂用計使孔子不能行使職權。孔子至此，就辭職引退。後來他周遊齊宋衛陳蔡楚等國，可是都沒有遇到知己，不得已，再回到魯國，刪詩書，定禮樂，贊周易，修春秋，以傳先王之道。他有弟子三千人，其中身通六藝者，有七十二人。</p>
<p>他爲人的精神，無論讀書做事，到高與的時候，連吃飯睡覺都會忘掉，憂愁也會丟掉，甚至於自己老到什麽地步也不問了。他又有不怕困難的精神，事事懇切，不稍假借，人家以爲不可救藥的時候，他還是拚命的幹去。所以當時人都批評他是一個「知其不可爲而爲之」的苦幹硬幹的學者。他學說的要點，主張人與人相互之閒，必須依着「忠恕」二字做去。</p>
<p>小朋友，孔子的誕辰又來臨了，我們想到他爲學和做事的精神，應該如何刻苦自勵，勇往直前的來闡揚孔子的學說，救起垂危的祖國。努力吧！我親愛的小朋友們。</p>
<h3>公路上</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒遇難記之三十一—</p>
<p>車廂裹塞塞滿了人已呢半個小時，可是還沒有到開車的時間，車裏的逃難人無可奈何的忍着氣等着，等着。到得綠旗一揚，汽車也等得不耐煩了，便呼的一聲開出了車站，趕到了黃沙夾石子的公路上，瘋狂般的向前奔馳着。</p>
<p>青的山，綠的樹，採薪的樵夫趕路的行人，在路上一切的一切，向後移轉着，幾多不同的竹籬，茅屋，小店和樹木都在車廂裏明兒的眼中一閃地飛過了。惟有遠的山，遠的樹，和遠的切景物，在旋轉不息，似乎這一切的東西放在旋螺上一般使得明兒有些眼花了。車仍然前進，四周的高山低岡團團的向他們作包圍的形勢。</p>
<p>從車廂的右邊望去全是山石的斷壁，和車不過四五尺的距離，這條公路全是把山開築而成。在車廂的左邊望去，幾千丈深的山凹，就在車輪的邊際，要是路上的石子鬆落下去，那結果是不可思議的了，使得明兒把自己的視綫移到別處去，不敢再看一眼。</p>
<p>車不住的沿着公路飛去，轉了好幾個灣，明兒回頭從車背後望去，一條狹長的公路蜿蜓的嵌在茫茫的山腰間，盤過了一個山峯，又繞着小山岡，宛如一尾赤鍊蛇在山裏盤行着。這種偉大的工程，眞是建設新中國所必需的命脈。</p>
<p>車廂的人們忽地站立不穩，大家不知不覺的向左倒去，就是坐的人也都有道個趨勢，又猛聽得一陣車子的呌聲，大家都担心車子出了毛病，那知車子的速率太快，又要轉個大灣，車夫便猛力的把車開慢，害得明兒心中跳動得很厲害，轉了道個灣後，羣山漸遠，而進入了平原，田嚼連綿，阡陌縱績，茅舍相接，人跡漸繁，呼吸頓時一暢，但是不多一刻，叉在羣山層層包圍中了。</p>
<p>「飛機飛機！」不知在車廂裏那一個人喊出這聲音，頓</p>
<p>時把車廂裏的談話，消滅得寂靜無聲。</p>
<p>「那裏？聲音也沒有聽得！是不是銀白色的？」也不知那一個人問着。車廂裏的人又止不住脚向前一傾，車子的聲音也靜默下來，一陣子「轟轟……」的飛機聲刺激着每一個人的耳膜。</p>
<p>睜大了眼，從車廂的窗口伸出頭去，六架飛機翺翔在雲霄裏，小得像六隻小蜻蜓飛在廣大的天邊，當然也看不出些什麽銀白色不銀白色，而機聲是響喨得有些糢糊，大概是山裹回聲的關係。這六隻蜻蜓由西邊的峯尖飛向東方的山腰裏去了。</p>
<p>「這有什麼大驚小怪？倒停了車，躭擱了行程。汽車夫，快開呀，」有一個胆大而心急的朋友說着。</p>
<p>「你不要輕視它，」今天要是銀白色的飛機，休想放我們過門，一定要來尋我們的事，至少把機關槍放放，他們的子彈是多得討厭了。」車夫也很幽默的說着，一面車子叉向前駛去了。在夕陽西下的當兒，明兒的車子才到達了目的地。</p>
<h3>一筆画</h3>

<h3>中國的聖地（上）</h3>
<p>— 壽淸</p>
<p>孔子是中國的聖人，他的故鄉是在山東南部的曲阜城，現在城中有一座孔廟，所以把那兒稱做「中國的聖地」，不能說是過份呢？</p>
<p>在曲阜，並無名山大川，不過就是因爲有聖地的勝跡的緣故，所以遊人們經過山東，往往都要去拜訪一决。</p>
<p>在好幾年前，我和幾個朋友經過徐州∶就乘便去遊曲阜。我們在徐州趁了火車出發，到了一個名呌「姚村」的小站上下來，雇了兩架小車，給車夫在後頭往前推進，十八里路程行了三個鐘頭，才望見一列不很高大的城牆，這便是曲阜城。進了城門，便下車往孔廟走去。經過了一條小街，見有一列很高的紅牆，牆裏建築着重重宏偉的廟宇，幾佔半個曲阜城大；這便是孔廟。</p>
<p>我們沿着紅牆，一直向北走到了孔廟的「毓粹門」。在門口通知了一聲，便有一個人領導着我們進去。裏面有一個很大的庭院，高聳着許多古柏。中央有一幢亭子似的屋子，據說，就是孔子生時講書的地方，呌做「杏壇」。杏壇旁邊有一扇小屋，裏面有一裸樹，相傳是孔子親手種的檜樹，現在已經枯死，只賸一條光禿的樹桿了。</p>
<p>再往北走，見有一座雄壯的殿宇，前有十根白石的雕龍柱，殿內正中供着孔子的神像，他拱着手向南安坐着。西邊還有十個像，都是孔子的弟子「就是學生」。據說，還呌大成殿。在殿後面有一座寢殿，供着孔子夫人的像。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（十五）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>彭其會記得讀本書，說一個人在臨死的時候，要是見一頭百靈鳥飛上天去，那麽他的靈魂也要飛上天去了。因此他心中非常難受，也非常失望，料知自己的性命一定不保，要和水中那些死狗死貓一同腐爛了。霎時之問，彭其又想到了他過去的種種罪惡，不得不追悔起來，可是他在平日間只知一味作弄畜類，越殘酷越是得意，那裏想到罪惡不罪惡呢？他又記得有一天在學校中，校長曾對着自己和另外幾個同學，作個別的訓話，爲人該以仁慈爲本，任何畜類，都有襲性，都有感覺，也一樣的知道痛苦，所以萬萬不可虐待它們，那時他只是坐着不動，也不說一句話，臉上滿現着輕蔑不屑的神情，眼送着教師走下講壇去，何會把他老人家的一番話聽在耳中，放在心上。但是到了現在，一切改過的機會都沒有了，再要聽從老師的訓也來不及了；望望前途，只是一片漆黑，那裏還有一綫的光明呢？於是他在那粉碎的心窩中，默默地禱吿着，禱吿上天，饒恕他的旣往，給他「條自新之路。在這個當兒，他是第三决也是末一次的浮到水面上來。</p>
<p>那百雞鳥飛得遠遠的，差不多已瞧不見了。但是在那彭其的蒼白的臉兒旁邊，來了一個軟軟的黑黑的鼻子，一雙棕色的大眼睛，注在彭其的眼睛裏，旣沒有報復的表示，並沒有甚麽親</p>
<p>切的神情。瞧上去只是抱着一種又嚴肅又懇切又驕傲的態度，而好像是認真辦事的樣子。它那柔軟而富有情感的嘴，以前會被彭共刺傷過的，此刻便用來啣住了彭其，啣得很牢，却並不傷害到他的身體，看它倒像並不用力，只好似啣着一頭水鳥一樣，隨即拍動它那前面的一變腳掌，鼓着勇氣向岸邊游泳過去。可是彭其究竟是一個人，比一頭死貓笨重得多，所以諾克斯啣着他游咏，實在是很費氣力的事，好容易游到岸邊，更拖上了岸，才把彭其掉落在地，它自己也在一旁伏下來，將一個脚掌放在彭其的身上，分明在說：「這一日事由我處置，不用旁人前來干涉。」</p>

<h3>黄金邀妥兩武生　藍月春與吳彥衡</h3>
<p>— 知白</p>
<p>黃金大戲院之班底，人才濟濟，向以整齊著稱。惟武生一行，自王筱芳脫離後，從無適當人選，咸感美中不足。黄金當局有鑒於此，最近消息傳來，已將武生藍月春邀妥，將於下月初開羅時與宋德珠楊寶森等人一齊登臺，此後黄金武生一席，有月春在，當可應付裕如，愚不禁爲黄金深慶得人也。</p>
<p>藍月春叉名小喜兒，爲武凈李永利（李萬春之父）之徒，幼嘗隨李永利學藝，與李萬春同在大世界練工甚久，旋去故都與李萬春同入兪振亭之斌慶社科班，在科時與李萬春同稱武生一傑，與李萬春合演兩將軍英雄義諸戲，牡丹綠葉，轟動一時。月春在科雖屈居萬春之下，爲萬春之下靶，其藝實不在萬春之下也。民十七李萬春初决隨梅闌芳南下，者番相偕同來，不期與萬春發生意見，感情失和多年，同窗竟致拆散，月春自離萬春，即未北返，十年來流落江湖，悶不得志，茲决應聘黄金，實予月春一大好機會，蓋其十年來未嘗有用武之地也。</p>
<p>月春吃虧嗓子扮相，唱唸欠佳，武工有相當根底，腰腿工夫，萬春不能及也。因扮相不美，故宜演開臉戲「艷陽樓」「狀元印」「蘆花蕩」皆其拿手傑作。月春雖留居江南垂十餘年，好在未染海氣，開打乾凈，手脚俐落，不溫不火，無海氣十足之弊。實在値得稱贊，者番出演黄金，人傑地靈，必能一現其大好身手。</p>
<p>再者此决宋德珠來滬，黄金方面，鑒於上决高盛麟之大受歡迎，因擬在北國武生隊中，覓一適常人物，偕宋同來，初擬邀聘孫毓堃，（即小振亭）奈孫自楊小樓故後，自命爲揚派傳人，架子頗大，索價八千，黄金以爲數過鉅，對對對邀孫之舉，乃作爲罷論，而改邊吳彥衡同來。</p>
<p>吳彥衡爲名旦吳彩霞之子，荀慧生之內姪，從武凈許德義學藝，藝頗不弱，不特武工有相當根底，唱唸做表，身上扮相，皆有可取，在今日武生人才寥落之下，吳固鳳毛麟角也。彥衡嘗隨荀慧生來滬，與滬人闊別已久，吳之藝不亞於高盛麟，高能在滬走紅，吳來必能大受歡迎無疑矣。</p>
<h3>言菊朋唱工之探討</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>二，放大要彩之處不美聽　爲要台下喝彩而將腔放大，本是一種「咬人法」，然須有好嗓子，放出之音大而好聽，唱出之腔規矩而有滋味，則求彩而得彩矣。今菊朋不然，極喜要彩，故常常放大，放大之結果，音乾而目斷，腔同而且慢，於是所要之彩，乃雜有笑聲，（吾細察彩聲中或含有友誼捧塲性質，）彩聲興笑聲齊發，反不如台下靜默爲佳。五十年前老角，唱時聞彩聲多不懌，謂攪亂其好腔，三十年前角色，無特意放音或使花以要彩者，平角特意要彩，乃近二十年事，每况愈下，亦勢使然，因包銀數鉅，得失心重也。昔楊四立耍花腔要彩，無彩不止其聲，台下每呼「通」結束之，開要彩之奇局，聞小達子因要彩，每請客聽戲，亦一怪法也。至京朝老生近來於做工上「洒血」（如搖頭）以要彩者有之，若隨時放大聲，使慢腔，特意要彩者，尙不多見，夫彩聲之來，貴乎自然，實至名歸，何必必必硬要？諺云：「强扭底瓜不甜，」瓜熟則蒂落，何用强扭，硬要與强扭，皆非自然，非自然，則其中含有危險性，何也，友人不好意思不喝一彩，陌生人必憎之矣，台下友人不過佔十分之一耳，故曰危險也。菊朋若用能力所有之嗓音平正唱之，其精處尙非餘子所及，蓋功力自深也，若努力大聲放之，猶之點金成鐵，毀玉使瑕，本欲要彩，反不得眞彩，菊朋智者，豈不見此，若不痛改此點，歸於平正，吾恐下决再來，有不堪設想者。吾非過甚其詞，蓋吾默察台下之空氣，以及採問顧曲界之輿論，而得此結論，心所謂危，不敢緘口不言也。或曰，菊朋此次演戲兩旬，座無隙地，黄金台主，賸餘之數，近兩萬金，菊朋豈不足號召耶？吾笑對曰，每日以千五百人計，兩句總數綫三萬人耳，捧塲而定常座者在內，占十之一，爲新到坤角侯玉蘭往著，叉十之二三焉，合上海現在總人口百分之一而弱，如猶不能賣滿，是眞大怪事矣。菊朋八年不至，叉其早年唱片硬札，聞者贊許，遠因種種，不必縷述，若不察賣座不衰之因由，說是「尺寸」不勻，及放大要彩之善果，則吾惟有仰天而敷，付之天知，摩挲吾眼，以觀其後而已，復何言哉！菊朋做工，近日大加簡練，有極精到極可佩之處，非二十年工夫不及此，偶有小疵，不掩大純，此點是其大進步，値得大書特書者，將來去共太甚斯可矣。（完）</p>

<h3>獻身祖國</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“The　Sun　Never　Sets"</p>
<p>「太陽永遠勿落」—這是大不列顛帝國夸耀他們殖民地上的國旗永遠飄揚在陽光之下，彷彿太陽勿落似的一句豪語。在電影上，宣傳帝國軍隊之威武者，亦數見不鲜，而最顯著的是詩人吉伯齡的「貢格庭」。「獻身祖國」中倫道夫族，曾爲帝國屢建勳功垂三百年之久，迄至不願「側身戎行」的小范朋克也終究和貝錫慗斯朋獻身祖國焉！</p>
<p>但是，現在歐洲（也是世界）的風雲如彼，張伯倫的政策又如此，大不列顚帝國征服有色種人的誇耀，似乎僅是骸骨的迷戀，「獻身祖國」的劇作者更逃避事實，將破壞世界和平的罪魁禍首，誘推在軍火商人的迭謠生事，而忽略了執行破壞世界和平的侵略者。鼓勵人民爲國效勞是値得推祟的，但不是「太陽永遠勿落」的誇耀，應由狹義的獻身祖國，而從事廣大的反侵略運動，達到眞正的世界和平！</p>
<p>導演羅倫李的處理手法也不見高明，第一，是整個故事用繁重的對白支持着，而陷於沉悶之境；第二，分幕不够緊凑，以致整個劇本成了三個割據的段落。至於個別塲面，小范朋克與家人門口時，明快而簡潔；海倫產期，小范朋克僞稱總部命令，召貝錫賴斯朋歸來，雨夜的空氣，各人的情緒跳動，及兄弟大閙，小范朋克送兄嫂離別，頗爲動人；飛機轟炸以後，電台中衆受震而死，里昂亞得力威等幾個特寫非常堅強有力。</p>
<p>演員中，小范朋克很能把握三個不同時期的性格變動。貝錫賴斯朋及里昂亞德威，女角維及尼亞費爾及白葩蘭奧妮都平平。</p>
<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>銀星顧梅君女士談：片段的回憶（下）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>在求學時期，我的學名是呌天嬋；後來起這梅君的新名字，說起來亦很覺可笑；因爲在一般的舊觀念下，還恐有人對於女兒家學唱戲與拍電影的事很不謂然，所以當於前往明星歌劇社報名入社之時，自己跑在路上邊走邊想：「生日在十二月裹，這是一個梅花的季節，那就決定改名梅君吧。」不想當下念就成章的梅君兩字，竟即就此成爲畢生的藝名了。</p>
<p>演唱平劇，是早年間最感興趣的事。曾經登台演唱過的汾河灣，小放牛，梅龍鎭，鴻鸞禧，戰蒲關等十幾齣旦角戲，雖多大膽從事不求甚解，未必都能演好，只是不論唱白，身段，台步各項，學起來却學得很快，未嘗見弱於人。隨拍後演電影，不但感到同樣的興奮，且亦不甘自菲，以爲也和學習平劇那樣，但須專心一志，決不難於獲得較高的成就。不意這拍戲工作似易實難，尤難求精，到今朝，片子雖經拍得不少，事實上却和理想相差甚遠；在自己看來，委實是很失望的全沒一部較可覜的作品。</p>
<p>現在，我常這樣默想：我眞是一個「小時了了」者，這幾年來的銀幕表現，簡直無甚進步可言；自己覺得很是慚愧，而這慚愧心理的反應，亦即越發加强了我努力奮鬭的決心。眞的，想起早年問深自期許的意向是差得太多了，我得快在慚愧愧愧心的鞭策下很急捷的加緊奮進。</p>

<h3>A Glimmer of Hope for European Peace: Germany Proposes a Solution with Five Conditions; British Ambassador Returns to London; Italian Prime Minister Suggests Convening a Four-Power Conference</h3>
<p>London: It is believed that German leader Hitler received British Ambassador Henderson yesterday at 3:00 PM, and well-informed sources consider this conversation extremely important. (Haitong Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>London: British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned here from Germany today with Hitler's peace proposals, and held a three-hour meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. He then entered Buckingham Palace to meet with the King. The Cabinet is scheduled to hold a full meeting tonight to consider Hitler's suggestions given to Henderson. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>London: "The Daily Express" recently reported that German leader Hitler yesterday delivered to British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson a letter to be taken back to London, containing five peace terms proposed to the British government: (1) If Britain agrees to abolish the remaining "unequal treaties" of the Treaty of Versailles and return Germany's former colonies, Germany would be willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with it; (2) The Free City of Danzig should be returned to Germany; (3) Poland would enjoy certain rights in the Free City of Danzig for a period of ten years, in exchange for allowing Germany to build a highway through the Polish Corridor; (4) Germany and Poland should hold meetings to discuss maintaining public order and preventing anti-German terrorist activities within Poland; (5) After the dispute between Germany and Poland is resolved, Germany can sign a non-aggression treaty with Poland, and Germany will guarantee Poland's border for a period of ten years. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: Foreign observers here have recently stated that Prime Minister Mussolini proposed to German leader Hitler to convene a four-power conference without preconditions, but requested that military action not be taken against Poland before a peaceful solution to the Danzig issue is found. It is rumored that this proposal has been accepted by German leader Hitler. Mussolini also intends to first hold a four-power conference, and then expand the scope to allow other countries to participate in discussions on other European issues. In addition, the German Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Ambassador to Germany held a long-distance telephone conversation yesterday to convey the opinions of Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler, which has attracted great attention from political figures here, who believe that war can hopefully be eliminated at the last moment. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: Newspapers recently commented on the European situation, stating that the situation is extremely serious, but also issuing hints that the current crisis has a "ray of hope." The Messenger reported that "Catastrophe is not impossible to prevent; new hope seems not without basis. At this last minute, there is still the possibility of negotiations. Credible common sense has been restored. Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler have repeatedly exchanged views, and Foreign Minister Ciano and authorities in various European countries are also actively engaged in diplomatic efforts, sparing no effort. All of this has revealed a glimmer of hope. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson's return to London with German leader Hitler's peace plan is also a good sign." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: The semi-official Stefani News Agency recently issued a message stating that German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini exchanged views several times yesterday. The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, also conveyed Hitler's views to Prime Minister Mussolini via long-distance telephone at 3:00 PM, with Foreign Minister Ciano also present. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, then notified German leader Hitler of Prime Minister Mussolini's reply at 6:00 PM. By 9:30 PM, Ambassador Mackensen again conveyed Hitler's views from the telephone to Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>London: British Ambassador to Germany Henderson again met with Hitler yesterday, making a second effort to avert European war, and is scheduled to fly back to London today to report to Foreign Secretary Halifax. This news has raised hopes in political circles, believing that there is now a way to break the deadlock and curb the sharp trend towards war. Henderson's return to Britain clearly carries proposals or questions that require a British response. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt: Renews Call for Peace to Germany; Hopes to Resolve Dispute Through Negotiations; Polish President Responds with Acceptance</h3>
<p>Washington: After President Roosevelt telegraphed the leaders of Germany, Italy, and Poland, Polish President Mościcki replied yesterday, agreeing to comply. He stated: "I have received your respectful telegram and am most impressed. My government has always believed that direct negotiations are the most appropriate way to resolve international disputes, especially between countries that share a border. In the past, we have signed non-aggression treaties with both Germany and the Soviet Union based on this principle. As for third-party mediation, we also consider it a fair way to resolve international disputes. Although it is not necessary to mention all the issues that have caused the dispute, I must say that it is not my country that has made demands or requested concessions from other countries. Your telegram advocates that both sides avoid hostile actions during negotiations, which the enemy naturally agrees with, but only if the other party also avoids direct or indirect hostile actions. At this time, all countries and nations in the world are eager for universal pacification to revitalize their inherent civilization. I pray that your call for peace will contribute to this pacification work, Mościcki." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington: After receiving the reply from Polish President Mościcki, President Roosevelt immediately telegraphed German leader Hitler a second time, stating: "I have just received a telegram from Polish President Mościcki, clearly expressing his agreement with the direct negotiations and mediation methods proposed in my respectful telegram. If you and your government also agree and are willing to resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, then the lives of millions of people still have a chance to be preserved, and the hope of establishing peaceful relations among modern nations worldwide and achieving prosperity still has a chance to be realized. People all over the world are eagerly awaiting your country to express its agreement following Poland. I am sending this telegram again, hoping you will understand, Roosevelt." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Reaffirms Determination to Resist Aggression; Europe's Fate Lies in the Polish Question; Harshly Condemns Soviet Union's Treachery</h3>
<p>Paris: Prime Minister Daladier delivered a broadcast address to the nation at 9:00 PM tonight. The gist of it is as follows: I will do everything in my power to avoid war, but if forcible methods are allowed to run rampant, the freedom of all nations in the world will inevitably be destroyed, and the French nation will not be spared. Therefore, we are determined to resist. The following is an excerpt of the full text: The Prime Minister first stated, "My character is known to the people of the country, and I will do everything in my power to avoid war. This should be deeply believed by the people of the country." All international issues can be resolved through negotiations. The issue of Danzig involves the freedom and survival of Poland, which is enough to trigger a European war. "The so-called freedom and survival of Poland is the freedom and survival of 35 million souls, which is related to the fate of other European countries. France is no exception. If our country sits idly by and watches other countries succumb one by one, the result will be that our country will not only lose its honor but also be isolated due to the demise of its allies, and we will not be able to come out and help them." In order to organize a peace front, our country has accepted constraints from countries willing to participate in this front and has conducted negotiations with the Soviet Union, but unexpectedly that country "suddenly changed its policy" and signed a treaty with Germany, evading the obligations arising from its past policies. "The negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union on a mutual assistance treaty were both ambiguous and suitable for publication at this time, and the content of the treaty is such that it increases the risk of France and its allies being subjected to aggression." US President Roosevelt and King Leopold III of Belgium have successively called for peace, and we admire their benevolent words. France sincerely responds to this. Fortunately, Poland's attitude is both calm and brave. Britain and France are determined to protect the freedom and independence of all nations and the honor of all mankind, hoping that wisdom will ultimately prevail. Unfortunately, I will ask all male and female citizens to face it with courage. "We French people want to maintain freedom and live in peace, but we are determined not to be driven and subjugated by violence and injustice." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon and immediately discussed the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. Deputies from all parties unanimously condemned the Soviet Union for "betraying its friends," saying that this matter only increased the possibility of war breaking out. They then passed a motion expressing their protest. However, the communist members believed that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty did not conflict with the organization of a peace front, so they refused to vote. The Communist Party faction of the Chamber of Deputies also met in the afternoon, and Secretary-General Thorez immediately gave a speech, expressing his support for the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, but said that if Germany continues to invade, the Communist Party members will unite with the people of the country to resist it. In addition, the Socialist Party faction also held a meeting and decided not to cooperate with the Communist Party because the Communist Party supported the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Belgian King's Call for Peace; Britain and the United States Respond</h3>
<p>Brussels: The British government today replied to the telegram from the Belgian King calling for peace, saying that the British government has always been prepared to do its utmost to assist in the resolution of all disputes through free negotiations. Recognition of solutions by force or threats of force would only destroy efforts to establish an international peace order to uphold peace and justice without violating any national rights or independence. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt recently telegraphed King Leopold III of Belgium, stating, "I am very pleased to hear that Your Majesty issued a declaration on behalf of the signatory countries of the Oslo Convention the other day, calling for peace. Your Majesty hopes that the leaders of other countries will also respond with a desire to maintain peace and security. I would like to state that my government and people share the same feelings as Your Majesty." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>German General Mobilization Temporarily Postponed; Tannenberg Commemoration Cancelled</h3>
<p>London: According to the Daily Express, the general mobilization originally scheduled to take effect at 3:00 AM this morning has now been temporarily postponed. At the same time, Hitler's speech commemorating the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg, which was scheduled to be delivered yesterday, has also been postponed. According to a British cabinet member, the situation has slightly improved. It is rumored that senior German military authorities have differing opinions on military action, and President Roosevelt's call for peace is also one of the reasons for the temporary delay in the deterioration of the situation. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The long-publicized Tannenberg victory commemoration ceremony, originally scheduled for tomorrow, has now been cancelled. This news was announced last night by the German official news agency. It is said that due to the serious situation, the solemn ceremony originally scheduled to be held in Tannenberg on Sunday will not be held. This ceremony was to commemorate the great victory of the German army in defeating the Russian army that invaded East Prussia in August 1914. Hitler had originally planned to attend and speak. Last night, Hitler was still revising his prepared speech due to the recent developments in the situation, which shows that the cancellation of the commemoration ceremony was a last-minute decision. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Meets with Four Ambassadors; Explains Position on Poland; Japan Protests Betrayal of Friendship</h3>
<p>Paris: According to French sources, Premier Hitler has destroyed all hope for European peace after meeting with the ambassadors of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan in Berlin yesterday. It is claimed that Premier Hitler warned the ambassadors of the democratic countries in Germany, instructing them to inform their governments that Germany should adopt a "prudent" attitude due to Poland's "atrocities" against Germany. His words implied that Germany's plan had decided to take clear retaliatory action against Poland. In another report on Hitler's conversation with the ambassadors, Hitler stated that Germany must "seize" Poland to end the German-Polish dispute. At the same time, it is reported that Hitler proposed convening a world conference, but did not indicate whether the conference would be held before or after the Polish issue was resolved. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: When German leader Hitler separately met with the ambassadors of Italy, Britain, France, and Japan in Germany this afternoon, it was rumored that he declared his intention to take action to protect Germans within Poland, and said that the current situation is like a vessel filled with water, which will overflow with the slightest disturbance. However, political figures here have all gained the impression that Germany may be trying to promote a conference to resolve the Danzig issue in a way that is favorable to Germany. According to diplomatic sources, Japanese Ambassador General Oshima protested to German leader Hitler about the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty and stated that the fourth article of the treaty, in the view of the Japanese government, contradicts the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Note: Article 4 states that any group that is directly or indirectly detrimental to one of the signatory countries, the other party shall not participate in it.) (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Offers Guarantees to the Netherlands and Belgium</h3>

(Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The German minister recently paid a visit to Queen Wilhelmina in the afternoon and declared to her that if war breaks out in Europe, Germany will not violate the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and is willing to respect its borders, but only on the condition that the Netherlands strictly adheres to neutrality. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>British Labour Party Publishes Letter to the German People; Rashly Starting a War Will Bring Disaster Upon Themselves; It is Not Too Late to Turn Back</h3>
<p>London: The British Labour Party published a letter to the German people, stating that Britain and France's determination to fulfill their promises will not be shaken by the German-Soviet treaty, and said, "War is imminent. If Hitler attacks Poland, it will not only be a war between Germany and Poland, but from that day on, it will be a war between Germany and Britain and France. Your government does not tell the truth. British workers have always been friends of the German people, so we tell you the truth. Your government has recently concluded a non-aggression treaty with Moscow. The government you have heard for six years is your greatest enemy has now become your friend in history. British workers now tell you with a very solemn attitude that this agreement will never affect the position of Britain and France. Germany lacks raw materials and food. If war breaks out, it will feel great difficulty in finding supplies because Britain and France will control the sea. We have no intention of destroying the German people. We have always been your friends. We are now telling you the truth as best we can while it is not too late. Peace can be preserved. If peace is preserved at this time, a new world of a new Europe can be created." (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>International Situation Not Optimistic; Observations from Paris</h3>
<p>Paris: Political figures have recently declared that although there is a possibility of negotiations in the current international crisis, the hope of a peaceful resolution is extremely slim. Officials from Britain, France, and Poland believe that democratic countries will never allow independent and autonomous countries to be dominated by others out of fear of the threat of war. As for the Axis powers, Italy's actions seem very active. The country's military position is extremely fragile, and it is unwilling to be a pawn and get caught up in the war vortex. Now that US President Roosevelt has requested mediation from the King of Italy, the country is likely to act as a mediator. However, it is still unknown to what extent German leader Hitler will accept Prime Minister Mussolini's opinion and back down. As for Italy's proposal to convene a four-power conference, since Poland is not included, it has a strong resemblance to the Second Munich Agreement. However, this plan has not been completely abandoned. Germany also seems not to reject negotiations. It is known from the temporary cancellation of the Tannenberg victory commemoration on the 27th of this month that German leader Hitler does not want to publicly deliver a speech that would restrict himself and wants to adopt a more flexible diplomatic approach. This is a good sign. However, Germany's ambitions are not limited to annexing Danzig. It also intends to recover all the territories of the country and the former Austro-Hungarian Empire before the European War. This is a reason for pessimism. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Britain Prepares to Form a Wartime Cabinet; Recruiting Figures from All Factions</h3>
<p>London: Observers have recently declared that if war breaks out, Britain will form a wartime cabinet, recruiting all key figures from the Conservative Party who have served as cabinet members, as well as leaders from various opposition parties. A cabinet sub-committee will be organized by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield, opposition Labour Party leader Attlee, Liberal Party leader Sinclair, and Conservative Party far-right leader Churchill, to preside over everything. In addition, former Foreign Secretary Eden may also re-enter the cabinet. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Britain Intensifies Implementation of Precautionary Measures</h3>
<p>London: Official sources have recently declared that various precautionary measures decided by the cabinet a few days ago have been rapidly implemented, and they are able to cope with any eventuality. However, the official refused to disclose how many reservists have been called up. According to general speculation, the strength of the British Army, including both active and reserve personnel, totals as many as 800,000. In the future, it will continue to be increased in accordance with the situation. In addition, the air defense force has been changed to wartime organization since June. In the past two days, it has been continuously strengthened. The evacuation of civilians from major cities is being planned. Teachers in small schools who are on vacation have been recalled to prepare for the evacuation of students. As soon as they receive an order from the authorities, it will be implemented. Shops and offices in the central area of London have been equipped with bomb-proof facilities. Larger businesses installed bomb shelters in September last year. In the West End, where aristocratic residences and clubs are concentrated, most houses have wire mesh installed on their windows to defend against shrapnel. Today, the Privy Council met at Buckingham Palace and decided to intensify the implementation of precautionary measures. The details will be published tomorrow. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>England and Germany and the International Situation</h3>
<p>Will there be peace or war in Europe? If peace, what will be the method of resolving disputes, and how will each country yield or stand firm? If war, how will allies and enemies be distinguished, and how will the two sides fare in victory or defeat? These are the current questions, and almost everyone on the street is grabbing someone to ask for answers. This is because the matter concerns not just a corner of Europe, but its influence extends far into the world and future generations, and everyone should pay attention to it. The reporter is perhaps ignorant and dull. With the matter pressing, not only do I not know the answer, but I also know that there are only a handful of heroes who can command the winds and clouds, and truly insightful individuals in the world. Yet, I wonder who can actually answer. Some decisively say there will be war, and others say there will be no war. But I secretly suspect that their words are no different from gamblers shouting dice rolls. Why is it so elusive? All the countries in the vortex have their own desires and policies they are determined to pursue. If everything could be decided by following the desire and policy of one side, then naturally there would be no further questions after the decision. The question lies in the intertwining of the desires and policies of various countries. It is not possible for one side to decide everything, and the reactions to this intertwining have unlimited possibilities for evolution. Only because there are too many possible evolutions, and one cannot grasp what is inevitable, is there an indivisible moment between peace and war, and everyone circles around this single strand. Therefore, both sides are mobilizing, conscripting, evacuating expatriates, changing the routes of merchant ships, giving speeches with stern expressions, and displaying actions with drawn swords and strung bows – none of these are not signs of the eve of a great war. However, the diplomatic prelude has not yet ended. For example, Polish President Mościcki's telegram in response to US President Roosevelt's suggestion to accept mediation, Roosevelt's re-telegram to German leader Hitler, and British Ambassador to Germany Henderson's return to England with a letter from Hitler, all happened yesterday. From this, one can glimpse that the hope for peace has not been completely extinguished.</p>
<p>Given the current situation, how can one definitively say whether there will be war or not, or even need to deduce whether there will be war or not? Affirmations and deductions are all verbose. What we do not tire of discussing is that the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a treaty of non-aggression. Regardless of how it was brewing, regardless of how long the decision took, the two countries clearly expressed the complete change in their policies only from the date of the signing and publication of the treaty of non-aggression. As this newspaper said the other day, with the complete and clear expression of the change in the policies of the two countries, everything concerning international relations must be "re-evaluated and reconsidered." This is undoubtedly the last opportunity for re-evaluation and consideration in this indivisible moment between peace and war. As for Germany, it certainly has its own desires and policies that it is determined to pursue, and it must have had a well-thought-out plan when it resolutely concluded the treaty of non-aggression with the Soviet Union. However, the content of the treaty, the tacit understanding established during negotiations with the Soviet Union when concluding the treaty, and the international reaction obtained in terms of spirit and reality after the conclusion of the treaty, are not entirely within Germany's desires and policies that it is determined to pursue. For example, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop believed that the Soviet-German treaty would have a good influence on Soviet-Japanese relations and German-Japanese friendship, and that Germany could mediate the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan. Who knew that Japan would be greatly angered, protesting to Germany outwardly, accusing it of betraying a friend, and abandoning its planned European strategy internally, drafting a new plan instead. Was this reaction anticipated? Then, after concluding the treaty with the Soviet Union, should Germany not re-evaluate and reconsider based on reality? I believe that there are two things that Germany urgently needs to re-evaluate and consider: (1) Germany's handling of Poland and the Free City of Danzig should greatly change its various attitudes and methods of the past six months to achieve a satisfactory solution to the outstanding issues. Germany's momentum, subjectively, is no longer what it used to be, and objectively, it is universally acknowledged, so it may as well abandon its original attitude and methods. (2) Germany should greatly change its pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese policy towards the Far East. In the past, what was needed from Japan was to shout and cheer, so as to benefit Germany's actions in Europe. Today, the needs are different, and Japan's unwillingness to be used by Germany again is undeniable. Therefore, Germany should recognize China as a long-time friendly and good customer, and restore its former friendship with China, maintaining this rich and great market. Moreover, the discord between England and Germany is due to something else and not because of China. That is, in the Far East, with China as the center, forming a multi-faceted harmony between China, England, China, the Soviet Union, and China, and Germany, is indeed something that can be done in parallel without conflicting.</p>
<p>As for England, everything it has encountered deserves sympathy. After the Soviet Union and Germany joined hands, it was natural for it to revise and transform its policies. The so-called revision and transformation should not mean abandoning its obligations. For example, the Anglo-Polish alliance was just completed yesterday, which is a strong indication of England's determination to fulfill its obligations. However, the main purpose of the Anglo-Polish alliance is to help each other and achieve a win-win situation. To seek the best of mutual assistance and win-win, it is necessary to consider each other, understand each other, and help each other. England should consider Poland, and Poland should also consider England. In this sense, England and Poland should examine the evolving environment, understand the difficult reality, and consider the standards that the two countries must fight for, so that what we do today should be different from what we did in the past, and jointly plan for a foolproof plan. I think that England should pay attention to this, firstly. England's main lifeline is overseas, and its first bulwark and first powerful enemy are both in the Far East. Is the first bulwark not something that must be protected? Is the first powerful enemy not something that must be guarded against? China should be the first choice to jointly protect the bulwark in the Far East and jointly defend against the powerful enemy in the Far East. In the past, although England had no demands on the European continent, it always considered it an urgent task to help stabilize the European continent. However, not only did it labor in vain, but it also became deeply involved in the vortex. Therefore, after this drastic change in the international situation, should England not abandon its old ways after fulfilling its absolutely necessary obligations on the European continent, and from now on value its overseas lifeline and strengthen Sino-British relations? I think that England should pay attention to this, secondly. If England and Germany are like this, other countries should promptly re-evaluate and reconsider everything about international relations, which is also similar.</p>

<p>Warsaw: According to information received here, another dispute occurred recently on the German-Polish border. A team of German sentries, carrying light machine guns, crossed the border near Misielnice in East Prussia, invading Polish territory by one kilometer and firing at Polish border guards. The border guards immediately returned fire, killing one sentry, while the others abandoned their light machine guns and fled back to Germany. In addition, authorities responsible for the matter have denied German newspaper reports that Polish anti-aircraft gun teams fired at three German transport planes, stating that a German plane had flown at high altitude over the Polish coastal defense area and that Polish anti-aircraft gun teams had fired warning shots, after which the plane immediately flew away. (Vahas dispatch, 25th) Moscow: Polish government authorities cut off telegraph and telephone lines to Germany last night, thus severing direct communication between the two countries. Prior to this, the Warsaw government had blockaded most of the border adjacent to Germany, as both German and Polish troops were actively reinforcing their borders. As for the border between Poland and Danzig, it was already blockaded by the authorities of the Free City of Danzig. Furthermore, telephone and telegrams from Poland to Germany must be relayed through Moscow communication agencies, as communication between Poland and the Soviet Union has not been interrupted at present.

<h3>US Government Discusses the International Situation, State Department Has Drafted Plans for the Evacuation of US Citizens</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt convened a meeting of various departments at 2 pm to discuss the international situation, which lasted for one hour. Afterwards, Secretary of State Hull immediately returned to the State Department to convene a meeting of various department heads to discuss (1) the impact of the war on the American economy and ways to prevent and remedy it, and (2) how to protect American citizens in war zones. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department recently announced that plans for the evacuation of American citizens in the event of war in Europe have been drafted as follows: (1) The State Department will set up a special office to handle the repatriation of American citizens. (2) Diplomatic missions established by the United States in various capitals and major commercial centers will establish special offices to resolve "the protection of the interests of foreign governments after the severance of diplomatic relations and other issues." According to the State Department, the purpose of the second measure is that, after the outbreak of war, a belligerent government may request the United States to take care of its interests in enemy territory, and the US government is prepared to accept this. The evacuation of American citizens will be carried out by commercial ships rather than warships, but in remote areas, warships will be used to escort them to major ports so that American citizens can board ships to return home. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt recently made a statement to the press, stating that (1) if the situation in Europe does not show signs of easing by the 28th of this month, he will remain in Washington, (2) although his telegram to German leader Hitler advocated for the selection of mediators to resolve the German-Polish dispute, he has no preconceived notions about the selection of these individuals, (3) the current crisis in Europe will inevitably affect the lives of Americans, and the US government has made preparations to minimize various impacts, and (4) the situation in Europe will not necessarily lead to war, and he does not intend to convene Congress for a special session until he is certain that war in Europe is imminent.

<h3>Britain Ceases Supporting the Pound Sterling Exchange Rate, Has Notified the United States</h3>
<p>London: Acting Chancellor of the Exchequer Hannes announced today that Britain has notified the United States, stating that it has ceased supporting the pound sterling. The US Treasury Department believes that this move by Britain is not a competitive devaluation of the currency, but a necessary step due to recent heavy losses of gold reserves. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London: The emergency financial plans recently adopted by the Bank of England and the Treasury Department, such as raising the bank rate and setting minimum prices for bonds, are considered by important figures in the banking community to be the most appropriate measures feasible in the current situation. The purpose is to maintain the country's assets. This is the entire measure of the new temporary policy. The increase in the bank rate from 2% to 4% is intended to restrict borrowing by private enterprises within Britain, as borrowing to revitalize private enterprises should wait until times are better. The increase in the interest rate can also reduce the withdrawal of foreign capital. As for not maintaining the pound sterling exchange rate, the main purpose is to maintain domestic gold reserves in an emergency. At the same time, to prevent panic sellers from selling public bonds, the measures taken last September were adopted, limiting the minimum prices of British public bonds. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>New York: Bankers estimate that British gold reserves have now decreased to £440,000,000. However, the financial plans currently adopted by Britain can prevent or at least reduce the outflow of gold. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Germany Encourages Japan to Conclude a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union, Hiranuma Plans to Reorganize the Internal Front First, Then Formulate a New Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Moscow: News here today states that Germany is attempting to persuade Japan to sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Japanese sources here acknowledge that Germany has made this request, but state that Germany has clearly failed to understand the relationship of this action to the complex situation in the Far East. They claim that it is practically impossible for Japan and the Soviet Union to sign a non-aggression pact. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received Japanese Ambassador General Oshima yesterday afternoon. Although no official announcement has been made, it is widely believed that Oshima conveyed the decision of the Japanese cabinet to protest the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. Germany's attitude can be seen in Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's remarks to reporters, in which Mr. Ribbentrop said that he firmly believed that this treaty would have a good influence not only on German-Soviet relations, but also on Japanese-Soviet relations. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: Political figures here believe that the diplomatic prelude in the international crisis has not yet ended and that there may be surprising developments to come. This refers to the possibility that Japan and the Soviet Union may sign a non-aggression treaty. If this were to happen, the power of the totalitarian countries would overwhelm the democracies. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Experienced observers here recently stated that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo suggested to the Soviet government before German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived here that the current disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan be resolved. Afterwards, before Foreign Minister Ribbentrop departed from here for Germany, he stated that he firmly believed that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would have a good influence on Soviet-Japanese relations and German-Japanese friendship. Based on this, Japan and the Soviet Union may follow in the footsteps of Germany and the Soviet Union and sign a non-aggression treaty. Once this materializes, Japan's actions in the Far East against England will be free, in line with Germany's wishes. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A Tokyo dispatch states that as a result of this morning's cabinet meeting, the Japanese government decided to protest to the German government regarding the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. The government also decided to proceed cautiously based on the new views expressed by the Chief Cabinet Secretary and formulate a new diplomatic policy. Some cabinet members urged Hiranuma to formulate a new diplomatic policy promptly based on the new views and to stop delaying. However, Hiranuma refused to respond to this. Observers attach great importance to Hiranuma's silence, as this is enough to indicate Hiranuma's attitude, namely that if the government wants to formulate a new policy, the internal front of Japan must first be reorganized, which is a prerequisite for determining the new policy. It is said that at today's cabinet meeting, cabinet members freely and frankly exchanged views on the various issues caused by German-Soviet friendship. (Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph here recently published an editorial commenting on Japan's reaction after Germany and the Soviet Union established a non-aggression agreement, stating that "Japan's distress is not only due to Germany's escape, but also due to Germany conducting secret negotiations with the Soviet Union for several months, while also dealing with Japan. It is strange that the German diplomatic authorities did not see this. But as far as Japan is concerned, it should have been suspicious long ago, but it failed to notice it and ended up unhappily. As far as Germany is concerned, its assistance to China is far worse than Japan's accusations against England. This is why Japan is not comforted by the sweet words of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and has decided to adopt an isolationist policy. However, it is not yet known whether the Berlin-Rome axis has gained an ally or only a well-meaning neutral country because of the establishment of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. But the ally that has been lost is obvious." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to an army spokesman today, although Germany and the Soviet Union have established a non-aggression treaty, Japan will never change its anti-communist national policy. At the same time, the policy of establishing a "New Order in East Asia" has not changed in the slightest. In short, Japan's foreign policy will never follow others in the future and will continue to advance based on its established national policy. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the fact that Germany, disregarding the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact and without consulting Japan first, concluded a five-power non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, newspapers here continue to criticize Germany today. According to the Chugai Business News, this is not a criticism of a resentful nature, because Germany has no moral values ​​at all and takes any cunning and despicable action on the grounds of protecting the existence of the country. It would be foolish for Japan to rebuke it. The Asahi Shimbun stated that under the current circumstances, it is impossible to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations because the Soviet Union has concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany and will act freely in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It was once rumored that General Osumi and General Terauchi, who were scheduled to attend the German National Socialist Party Congress, would temporarily postpone their trip to Germany due to the rapid changes in the European situation. As a result of discussions between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the naval and land military authorities, it was decided to send the two generals to Germany as planned. This telegram was notified to the Japanese embassies in France and Italy on the 26th. (Domei dispatch, 26th)</p>

According to semi-official French sources, Marshal Voroshilov, the Soviet Minister of Defense, told the leaders of the Anglo-French mission that because the German-Soviet Pact has been concluded, the Soviet government believes that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union no longer serve a purpose and should not be continued. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

A high-ranking official of the Soviet government stated that after the Supreme Soviet meeting to be held on Monday, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, plans to depart for Berlin to meet with German authorities.

It is generally believed that the ambassadors were informing Molotov that the military delegations of their respective countries would be departing soon. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Troops Concentrated Northeast of Gibraltar</h3>
<p>British Gibraltar - A thousand Spanish soldiers, fully armed, have recently concentrated near San Roque, six miles northeast of here.

The Italian ship "Infusoia" from the Italian port of Naples bound for New York, originally scheduled to stop briefly in this port, also temporarily canceled its plans. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Announces Situation on Mongolian Border</h3>

<h3>British Foreign Office Responds to Ambassador Guo Regarding the Extradition of Four Chinese Nationals in Tianjin, This Action Should Not Be Considered as Recognition of the Puppet Government</h3>
<p>London - Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, sent a note to the British government on August 12, protesting the British government's decision to hand over the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case of Cheng to the Japanese. The British Foreign Office has now published an abstract of its reply to Ambassador Guo today. The reply clearly stated that the only reason the British government did not immediately agree to extradite the four criminals when the local court issued the arrest warrant was that the evidence presented at the time regarding the crime was insufficient. Subsequently, British and Japanese representatives began talks in Tokyo on July 24. During the talks, the Japanese side presented evidence, and the British government consulted the opinion of the highest legal experts, and decided that the preliminary hearing for the two criminals on charges of murder has been established, and the other two criminals have been charged with being members of an illegal terrorist group. The British government has always maintained that the case should be dealt with on its merits, and should not involve other disputes arising from the situation in Tianjin. As for using the defendants as hostages, or using them as a concession by the British government, it cannot be a problem. As for the handing over of these four people to the court, the Tianjin British Municipal Council now intends to hand over these four people to the court that has been a de facto court for the past two years for trial and to execute the arrest warrant issued by the court. This action seems to be no different from the hundreds of cases that have been executed previously. The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Authority has no other way to go. I am deeply convinced that after reflection, you will agree that, as stated in the letter, it is both infeasible and unreasonable to transfer these four people out of Tianjin against the opposition of the Japanese side and hand them over to a recognized Chinese authority elsewhere in China. At the same time, because these four people cannot be indefinitely detained without trial, there is no other way but to hand them over to the local authorities. As for the claim that the actions taken by the Tianjin British authorities in this case or similar cases in the past will constitute recognition of the so-called provisional government, the British government cannot agree to this statement. In fact, the government has not been recognized by the British government, nor, as far as we know, by any other government. Maintaining the neutrality of the Tianjin British Concession and not using it as a base for hostile actions has always been the aim of the British government. This attitude has been repeatedly explained to the Chinese government, such as the exchange of notes by the British Ambassador in July 1938 regarding the use of the Tianjin British Concession as a base for anti-Japanese activities and the guarantees that the Chinese government can give to prevent such activities from happening again. The British government, in view of its implication to the Japanese government (in the opinion of the British government, the preliminary hearing has been established), believes that it is no longer possible to refuse to hand over these four Chinese to the local Chinese authorities in Tianjin, and has already informed the British Municipal Council of this intention. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Chinese people here are deeply impressed by the announcement made by the British government regarding the four suspects detained in the Tianjin British Concession. The declaration stated that after consulting the opinion of the highest legal experts, the British government has decided that the preliminary hearing for two of the four criminals on charges of murder has been established, and the other two criminals have been charged with being members of an illegal terrorist group. Because the Chinese side has long had the impression that the British side will not extradite these four people, it is even more surprised by this declaration. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, has telegraphed Chongqing for instructions. At the same time, it is heard that the Chinese government has made a formal request to Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, to hand over these four people to the Chinese government for handling, because according to the Treaty of Tianjin, the Chinese government is the only legitimate Chinese authority. It is claimed that the Aid China Movement Committee has entrusted its lawyer in Shanghai to re-apply for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, and it is heard that the lawyer will act as the direct representative of each criminal and act within the judicial jurisdiction of the Chinese government.

It is believed that the "Kormoran" is now taking a similar strategy and awaiting orders from the authorities. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese from Siam in Yunnan Organize the "Siam Overseas Chinese Association for Staying in Yunnan", Preparatory Meeting Held in Kunming the Other Day, Yunnan Authorities Have Agreed to Allocate Land for Colonization</h3>
<p>Kunming - Overseas Chinese from Siam in Yunnan, due to discrimination against Chinese in Siam recently, advocated organizing the "Siam Overseas Chinese Association for Staying in Yunnan." At 5 p.m. on the 25th, a preparatory meeting was held at the Kunming YMCA. A Chinese man, who had just arrived in Kunming from Siam, reported on the recent situation of discrimination against Chinese in Siam, saying that Siam, since the coup, has been instigated by the Japanese side to assist evil and has thus launched a large-scale campaign against Chinese. As of the time I left Siam, more than 40 schools run by our overseas Chinese had been closed, and even the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese in Siam, the Chung Hua High School, had been forced to close. As for newspapers run by overseas Chinese, all of them were closed by the Siamese authorities. To date, no Chinese newspapers are published in Siam.

<h3>Nehru Talks About Impressions in Chongqing</h3>

The weather here has been very hot for the past few days, and Chongqing is a mountainous city. According to Nehru, there are 150 steps from the street to the Diplomatic Guesthouse where he is staying. Nehru continued that the Indian people and newspapers are very concerned about Chinese affairs and are willing to publish more news about China, but at present the supply of Chinese news to Indian newspapers is very insufficient. When asked by reporters about his impressions of encountering a Japanese air raid, Nehru recalled that he witnessed an air raid in Barcelona a year ago. The Chinese authorities here are currently not publicizing Nehru's activities, such as meeting with dignitaries and visiting factories and ordnance factories.

<h3>Northern China Locust Plague Severe</h3>
<p>Beiping:  A famine may loom in Northern China, following the terror of war, as crops spared from flooding now face the threat of locust plagues. According to travelers arriving from the east, locusts are swarming in unusually large groups, advancing from the flooded areas towards Beiping and expected to arrive within a week. Wherever they pass, the countryside is being devoured. Local farmers still remember the locust plague of 1929, when crops in the Beiping area were completely wiped out. Therefore, they are now harvesting grains as quickly as possible. Temples east of Beiping are crowded with people praying to be spared from the locust plague. Five thousand refugees have already arrived here by train from the flooded areas, and at least 20,000 more are coming on foot. Providing them with shelter is causing the local authorities great concern, as food prices are rising, having doubled in the past week. According to Tianjin news, foreign authorities there believe the flooding will continue for three more months. They hope that the river will recede before freezing begins in early November, allowing Tianjin to pump out the accumulated water. Yesterday, the water level in Tianjin rose further due to continued rainfall.

<h3>Since the Start of the War of Resistance, China's Public Debt Issuance Totals Approximately 3.67 Billion Yuan, Only One-Quarter of Japan's Debt Amount</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: China's War of Resistance against Japan has been ongoing for over two years. Military expenditures are extremely vast, as the battle lines extend for five to six thousand li, and the number of soldiers fighting on the front lines reaches over two million. Expenditures must be very substantial, yet according to investigations, they are less than one-third of Japan's. China's average daily war expenditure is over 5 million yuan, while Japan's averages over 18.9 million yuan per day. At the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance, China's total expenditure for one and a half years was approximately 3 billion yuan. As of the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the total expenditure was around 4.5 billion yuan. Such a massive deficit cannot be sustained without constantly raising funds from various sources. In addition to reorganizing taxes, creating new taxes, issuing corresponding banknotes, controlling import and export trade, managing foreign exchange, promoting donations and savings, the issuance of public debt remains the only rapid method for raising war funds. According to a financial expert, the central and local government public bonds issued or borrowed since the start of the War of Resistance are listed as follows: (1) Central government domestic bonds include the 500 million yuan National Salvation Bonds issued in October of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the 17 million yuan Guangdong Financial Consolidation Bonds issued in November of the same year, the Gold Bonds of 100 million taels of customs gold, 50 million US dollars, and 10 million British pounds issued in May of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the 500 million yuan National Defense Bonds issued in the same month, the first batch of the 100 million yuan Relief Bonds, totaling 30 million yuan issued in July of the same year, the 600 million yuan Reconstruction Bonds issued in two installments on April 1st and August 1st of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], and the 600 million yuan Military Supplies Bonds issued in two installments on June 1st and October 1st. Among these, only the National Salvation Bonds issued in the early stages of the War of Resistance were directly and widely raised from the people, and even that was not fully subscribed. Most of the domestic bonds were underwritten by national banks. (2) Foreign debts borrowed by the central government include the 150 million French francs and 144,000 British pounds from a certain railway loan in April of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], two barter loans from the Soviet Union, each of 50 million US dollars in the same year, a British loan of 500,000 British pounds in December of the same year, a US loan of 25 million US dollars in the same month, and a second US loan of 12 million US dollars in the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]. The total for the first two items is 356 million yuan, with domestic debt accounting for the absolute majority and foreign debt issuance being considerable as well. (3) Public bonds issued by local governments include the 5 million yuan Hubei Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in August of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the 2.5 million yuan Shandong Province Land Consolidation Bonds issued in November of the same year, the 2 million yuan Anhui Province Highway Completion Bonds issued in the same month, the 15 million yuan Guangdong National Defense Bonds issued in March of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the 1.8 million yuan Hunan Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in July of the same year, the 2 million yuan Gansu Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in the same month, the 5 million yuan Henan Province 6% Bonds, the 8 million yuan Fujian Province Reconstruction Bonds, the 10 million yuan Zhejiang Province 6% Bonds, the 8 million yuan Shaanxi Province Reconstruction Bonds issued in October of the same year, the 4 million yuan short-term treasury bills from the Guangdong Provincial Government Finance Department issued in January of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], and the Jiangsu Province Local Financial Consolidation Bonds and Guangxi Province 6% Bonds, each of 8 million yuan issued in April and May, totaling 100 million yuan. Compared to Japan, the total amount of public bonds scheduled to be issued in 1937 (314.4 million yen), 1938 (560 million yen), and 1939 (570 million yen), totaling 1.45 billion yen, is less than one-quarter. However, due to the limited absorption capacity of the people, Japan's public bonds scheduled for issuance over the past three years have had unsold remnants each year. In 1937, 92.9 million yen remained unsold, and in 1938, the unsold amount increased to over 220 million yen. This year's sales performance is expected to be even worse than last year due to the significant reduction in private inventory, the absence of the sharp increase in capital storage as last year, and the naturally declining absorption capacity for funds needed to expand production. Due to the poor absorption of public debt and the general shortage of materials, the Japanese government has been forced to issue a large amount of paper currency to meet its financial needs, leading to an inevitable malignant inflation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Suffer Further Casualties in Jiangyin City and Countryside; Chinese Troops Active in Qiaozhi, South of the City</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The area south of the city gate, about a li away, has been controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Japanese troops are stationed at the Shifang Temple and the Qian Clan Ancestral Hall. The day before yesterday, the Japanese troops at Shifang Temple were being redeployed when they were suddenly ambushed by guerrillas from Huashan, who opened fire and killed several Japanese soldiers before retreating.

Afterwards, they only conducted searches throughout the town for a long time, causing harm to several innocent villagers.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Use Shenzhen as a Base, Wildly Hope to Open the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Line; Japanese Aircraft Fly Over Hong Kong Airspace</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Japanese troops successively invaded Nantou and Shenzhen on the 16th, they have been rapidly launching large-scale operations since the 17th, continuously increasing their troops. Initially, they increased from 1,200 to nearly 3,000 soldiers, busily setting up fortifications. They used the Hong An Hotel in the market town as their headquarters and occupied the Guan Di Temple, the An Ren Charity Hall, the County Government, and the Tong Le Ju as barracks. They also set up a radio station in the Cai Neng Ji store. Most of the Japanese troops were distributed in the villages near Shenzhen, including Huangbeiling, Xiangdong, Xiangxi, Caiwuwei, Luohu (Chinese territory), and Hubei, with strict precautions. Subsequently, they increased their troops to over 10,000, with infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other types of soldiers equipped with dozens of tanks. Some of them were puppet troops. They immediately used Shenzhen as a base and advanced in three routes: (1) Straight along the Shenzhen-Henggang Highway towards Henggang and Longgang; (2) Attacking Shatoujiao along Wutong Mountain; (3) Attacking Lilang and Pinghu to the west along the railway. According to military intelligence on the 18th, fierce battles have broken out on all three routes. In addition, the Japanese troops in the Shilong area also launched attacks in coordination with the advance of Shenzhen troops, departing from Dongguan and Shilong to attack Zhangmutou from both sides, aiming to converge with the Japanese troops advancing west from Shenzhen and open the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon line. Battles have also occurred here. Judging from the Japanese's decisive actions, they are attempting to eliminate the guerrilla teams in Dongguan and Baoan counties, then attack Huiyang and Boluo before plotting to advance northward. Their plan is indeed vicious.</p>
<p>Battle Reports from Three Routes</p>
<p>The Japanese troops, consisting of approximately 500 infantry and cavalry, advancing northeast from Shenzhen, invaded Shatoujiao on the 17th. Because this area is the closest border between China and Britain and there are very few Chinese troops stationed there, the Japanese troops were able to occupy it leisurely that evening. Fortunately, the residents had already fled. After occupying Shatoujiao, the Japanese troops sent scouts to continue advancing towards Dapeng and Shayuchong, causing a very tense situation in Dapeng and Shayuchong. Local residents quickly evacuated. The Japanese troops advancing towards Longgang along the Shenzhen-Henggang Highway, approximately 500 in number, set out on the morning of the 17th and occupied Henggang. In the afternoon, a large force of approximately 1,000 soldiers, along with dozens of transport vehicles, arrived and gathered in Henggang. Several Japanese aircraft also patrolled and bombed Danshui and Huiyang all day. It is reported that the Fourth Column of the Chinese army under Chen Shengrong and the Third Column under Luo Kun, retreating along the highway, are defending the strategic locations near Longgang, forming a defensive position. They have already engaged with the Japanese troops. Chinese military authorities, believing that this area is close to Danshui and must be defended to protect the vanguard of Huiyang, have ordered Chen and Luo to respond cautiously and have deployed troops from Huiyang to reinforce the area. A major battle is expected to break out during the day. The morale in Huiyang city is stable, and everything is normal. The Japanese troops advancing directly along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway intend to open the Guangzhou-Kowloon line, so they deployed troops in two routes. One route, advancing west along the railway from Shenzhen, has been advancing towards Pinghu and Lilang with approximately 600 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, led by cavalry. The Chinese troops defending this area, the First Detachment of the Fourth Guerrilla Column under Yuan Huazhao, the Second Battalion under Wang Zuoyao, and the Eighth Security Regiment under Zhang Yu, encountered the Japanese troops in the Pinghu and Lilang area on the morning of the 18th and engaged in fierce battles. The Japanese troops used artillery fire to cover the advance of their infantry and cavalry. The Chinese troops defended bravely, and the battle situation was intense. The two armies are now in a stalemate. On the 17th, three Japanese aircraft flew to the Pinghu, Tangxia, and Shigut area and dropped bombs, likely to assist the Japanese troops' advance north.</p>
<p>Situation in Dongguan and Longgang</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in the Dongguan and Shilong area, to respond to the battle in the Pinghu area and to encircle the Chinese troops along the railway line, also deployed troops from Dongguan and Longgang to converge and attack Zhangmutou, attempting to occupy Zhangmutou and then sweep down the railway to meet with the Japanese troops advancing north from Shenzhen, realizing the ideal of completely connecting the Guangzhou-Kowloon line. It is reported that the Japanese troops in Dongguan and Longgang set out on the 17th. That evening, they advanced to the Tutang area west of Zhangmutou and encountered the Chinese troops, leading to battles. At 5:00 AM on the 18th, the Chinese Independent Detachment under Yuan Huazhao attacked from Dalang and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops for approximately three hours, killing over forty Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army suffered over twenty casualties. According to military intelligence from Huiyang, the Japanese forces in the Zhangmutou area are not strong, and the Chinese army still has the advantage. However, Japanese warships were spotted on the sea off Huiyang on the 18th. That morning, approximately one hundred Japanese soldiers landed in Aotou in several speedboats and were discovered by the Chinese forces defending the area, who met them with fierce attacks. The remaining Japanese troops retreated back to their ships. The local situation is now stable, but residents have begun to evacuate to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<p>Situation in Hong Kong Territory</p>
<p>The Shenzhen Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has been heavily guarded by the Japanese troops in recent days. Railway traffic has been blocked. Fortifications have been constructed with steel plates and barbed wire is spread everywhere. Japanese soldiers are stationed in the Wenjindu and Luohu area for guard duty. The Japanese flag is hoisted high at the Shenzhen Station. The customs checkpoint is guarded by Japanese soldiers. Pedestrians are not allowed to pass through Wenjindu. However, many refugees, having fled in a hurry with only their clothes on their backs, still risked sneaking in to inspect their devastated homes and fields. Their miserable and displaced state is unbearable to witness.</p>
<p>Also, Shatoujiao is an important road connecting China and Britain. The southern side of the same street belongs to British territory, and the northern side belongs to Chinese territory. When the Japanese troops occupied the area, the Hong Kong police authorities, ordered to deploy defenses on the border, dispatched New Territories Superintendent Parker to Shatoujiao on the Chinese side at 10:30 AM on the 17th to meet with Japanese Major Akita to explain everything, so that the Japanese troops understood the location of the Sino-British border. The situation in Wenjindu and Shatoujiao was such that although there was still a narrow passage for Sino-British traffic, pedestrians were absent. The weather was gloomy, with occasional light rain, making the scene even more bleak and desolate. The British and Indian troops guarding Shatoujiao were more numerous than in other areas, and their precautions were particularly tense.</p>
<p>At 9:10 AM on the 17th, twelve Japanese aircraft were spotted over Stanley in southern Hong Kong, flying from east to west towards the Tai O area. The Japanese aircraft flew in four groups of three, at an altitude of over 15,000 feet. The Hong Kong defense forces witnessed the passage of the Japanese aircraft but did not fire at them.</p>
<p>The waters of Ma Shi Wan and Deep Bay belong to British territory, while the land belongs to Baoan County in China. The coast in the Ma Shi Wan area includes Shatoujiao and Shayuchong, while the coast in the Deep Bay area includes Shekou, Shaxi Village, and Shatou. The coast is currently occupied by Japanese troops. Therefore, to protect its maritime borders, the Hong Kong military authorities dispatched two British warships on the 17th to patrol the area. Naval authorities issued a statement saying that the British warships HMS Scarab and HMS Mosquito were conducting exercises outside the harbor and have now been ordered to sail to Ma Shi Wan and Deep Bay to ensure the integrity of British territorial waters.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Regulations for Teachers' Day Commemoration</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 26th: After the central government decided on August 27th as Teachers' Day, the Ministry of Education, to encourage the spirit of service among teachers, to harmonize teacher-student relations, and to awaken society's respect for teachers, has formulated commemorative regulations for Teachers' Day.

<h3>The Special Significance of the First National Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>— Lu Guanliu</p>
<p>The advocacy of Teachers' Day has been going on for several years. However, for the past few years, it has always been teachers singing their own praises. The national authorities have not officially recognized it, and people in society have not paid special attention to it. Every year when this day arrives, everyone follows the example of celebrating, either taking a day off or having a dinner, and it passes by time after time in a muddleheaded way.</p>
<p>This year's Teachers' Day had already passed, but according to the reports in the newspapers, Teachers' Day has been stipulated by the central government to be held on the day of Confucius's birthday. This is indeed a message that is worth paying attention to. We must not say that this is an ordinary thing. We must recognize the special and great significance it contains. The first question that floats in our minds is that the Teachers' Day, which has been advocated for many years, has never been approved by the authorities. Why is it that today, when difficulties are heavy, the central authorities, amidst the myriad tasks of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, have instead paid attention to the promotion of Teachers' Day? What is the reason for this? The answer is because the government attaches great importance to teachers. Now is the time when we are working hard to rejuvenate, and the responsibility of teachers is undoubtedly extremely great. The government's stipulation of Teachers' Day is to make us teachers recognize the importance of our responsibility, and to stand up and assume the important task of educating the people, inspiring conscience, and leading society.</p>
<p>The second question that floats in our minds is why Teachers' Day has been stipulated to be held on the day of Confucius's birthday. The answer is that Confucius is the greatest educator in our country's history. His words and deeds have had a very great impact on society and the country. Now, setting Teachers' Day on this day, on the one hand, makes people in society think of the respectability of teachers from the loftiness of Confucius's position. On the other hand, it makes teachers not underestimate their own profession, and be able to take Confucius as a role model to learn Confucius's good behavior. Confucius was a man more than two thousand years ago, and his thoughts and theories naturally have their own social background. It is certainly true that we, living in the age of scientific enlightenment in the twentieth century, should have newer thoughts and newer morals. However, Confucius's good morals still have many things worth imitating, especially now in the Shanghai educational community, at least the following advantages should be learned from him. The first is to learn Confucius's ability to distinguish right from wrong and to hate evil like an enemy. Confucius's theories start from a person's self-cultivation, and extend to governing the country and pacifying the world. He believed that the method for a person to cultivate themselves is to rectify the heart and make the intention sincere. He believed that a person whose heart is not rectified and whose intention is not sincere is a person without personality. He deeply hated people without personality because he hated evil like an enemy. Therefore, he started to kill Shao Zhengmao, a chaotic politician, less than seven days after becoming the Lu Sikou. The charge he killed Shao Zhengmao on was because he gathered crowds and formed societies, advocated heresies, and confused right and wrong. Therefore, he never tolerated Shao Zhengmao and killed him. He also wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals to praise good and criticize evil, with righteous words and strict definitions, so that ordinary chaotic ministers and traitors without personality would know what to be wary of. His spirit of being strict with right and wrong and hating evil like an enemy is what we should emulate.</p>
<p>The second is to learn Confucius's enthusiasm for education and willingness to take responsibility. Confucius was unable to realize his aspirations due to the constraints of the environment at that time. Therefore, he concentrated on teaching and instructing students. The main points of his teaching also focused on the cultivation of personal character. He had a spirit of enthusiasm for education, what is called "learning without satiety and teaching without weariness." He was also able to teach according to aptitude and carry out the work of popularizing education. Therefore, he said, "There is education without discrimination." Moreover, he not only taught students to learn, but also taught students to practice. Because of his enthusiasm for teaching, he had more than three thousand disciples, and many of them became famous later on. We, who are responsible for educating the next generation of citizens, should learn from Confucius's example, establish our own noble personality, be a role model for young students, and sow seeds of justice in the innocent minds of students.</p>
<p>The third is to learn Confucius's frugal life and strict moral conduct. Confucius referred to scholars as "shi" (士) and "junzi" (君子). The standard for "shi" was to have integrity, ability, and especially moral conduct. Therefore, he said, "Wealth and honor obtained through injustice are like floating clouds to me." His student Zizhang also said, "A shi gives his life when he sees danger, and thinks of righteousness when he sees gain." He also defined the meaning of "junzi" as "cannot be corrupted by wealth and honor, cannot be moved by poverty and lowliness, cannot be subdued by power and violence." Moreover, he was not only able to teach students this way, he was indeed able to do so himself. When he was traveling, he came to Chen and Cai. Because of the lack of travel expenses, he ran out of food for several days. The people who traveled with him all complained. He said, "We must be able to maintain our integrity when we encounter difficult times, and we must not abandon ourselves because of difficult times." Now, when teachers are generally in a state of expensive rice and firewood, meager income, and increasingly impoverished lives, his frugal and self-improving life is indeed worth emulating.</p>
<p>However, we should not just learn everything from Confucius and think that we are good enough. We must know that the current era is very different from thousands of years ago. The concept of loyalty to the emperor in the past must be replaced by the work of loving the country. The individual theories of the past must be replaced by collective actions. We must understand the mission given to us by this great era, and the future of our country and nation, and shoulder the responsibilities that every descendant of the Yellow Emperor should bear. Therefore, before this first National Teachers' Day, in addition to paying attention to personal cultivation, encouraging each other, and finding ways to strengthen personal will, we must also be able to actively unite so that everyone participates in the life of the organization, so that we can jointly move towards a bright future.</p>
<h3>Confucius's Birthday and Teachers' Day to be Commemorated Separately; Confucius's Birthday Commemoration Still to be Held According to Original Regulations</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 15th: This year's Teachers' Day commemoration will be held separately because the central government decided that the Teachers' Day ceremony will not be incorporated into the Confucius's Birthday commemoration ceremony. The Executive Yuan has now ordered the Ministry of Education that, before the Teachers' Day commemoration ceremony and program have been approved, this year's Teachers' Day commemoration should be held separately, and the Confucius's Birthday commemoration should still be held according to the original regulations.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Subsidy for Private Schools: Teacher Stipends and Free Tuition for Impoverished Students Deadline for Requests: 15th</h3>
<p>In consideration of the high cost of living in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially stipulated within the 1939 subsidy funds for several private schools that a portion will be used as stipends for teachers' living expenses and free tuition for impoverished students. This is intended to provide some additional assistance to impoverished teachers beyond their original salaries, and to prevent some students from impoverished families from dropping out of school. The Public Works Department also stipulates that each school must submit teachers' receipts and signed forms from parents of free tuition students for verification, in order to ensure credibility. Furthermore, the Public Works Department's 1940 subsidy request forms have been distributed since the 25th of last month. The deadline for these requests is September 15th. Consequently, the number of people filling out subsidy forms has been unusually crowded recently.</p>

<h3>Open Swimming All Concluded: Lu Shungen Loses to Lugen in 220 Yards; Lin Meiling and Wu Jiahua Also Suffer Miserable Defeats Yesterday</h3>
<p>The final four events of the open swimming competition were held last night at the Rowing Club. Lu Shungen participated while ill in the 120-yard freestyle, losing to Lugen by half a body length. The Rowing Club pool is over 33 yards long, so it requires swimming six laps and twenty yards. When turning at the last lap, Shungen was still slightly ahead, but unexpectedly suffered a miserable defeat at the finish line. The time was 1 minute 39.4 seconds, which is more than 10.2 seconds slower than the highest record. Wu Gansheng and Zhong Shoujun were absent from the 200-yard breaststroke, and only three people participated. Hall performed butterfly style throughout, with a time of 2 minutes 50.2 seconds, which was only slightly better than Griepp's 2 minutes 52 seconds in the preliminary round. Wu Jiahua was able to compete in the middle, but later failed due to exhaustion. In the women's 50-yard backstroke, Miss Lin Meiling also suffered a miserable defeat. All eighteen men's and women's events of the Shanghai Open Swimming Competition have now been completed. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Anti-Sweeping War Imminent in Shanghai Suburbs; Chinese Troops Have Made Thorough Preparations; Regular Troops Stationed in Shang, Song, Qing Counties; Jiangnan Guerrilla Area Prepares for Mobile Warfare</h3>
<p>The Central Government is actively mobilizing a large number of regular troops to the counties in the Jiangnan Guerrilla Area, planning large-scale mobile warfare in preparation for recovering lost territory. It is believed that in view of the chaotic situation of mixed troops in the counties on the outskirts of Shanghai, it is urgent to reorganize them. The Military Commission has ordered General Liu Jianxu to appoint Zhang Luanji, the commander of the newly formed 30th Division, to be responsible for the reorganization. It is heard that the counties near Shanghai will be divided into four major districts, namely Shanghai City, Shang-Song-Qing, Feng-Nan-Chuan, and Tai-Jia-Bao, etc. Military commissioners with military talent will be appointed to each county and district to conduct practical training locally, in order to create a strong and effective force and launch anti-sweeping guerrilla warfare. The 30th Division has made thorough preparations and has dispatched the entire 88th Regiment of Tian Xiushan to be stationed in Shang, Song, and Qing counties. Rumors that the 33rd and 34th Divisions are opening in Shanghai may be a misunderstanding of this.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Nanhui Request a Delay in Military Action: The Ogawa unit of the Japanese army that invaded Nancheng and Datuan is facing difficulties in military action because there are no roads in the area, and the suburbs are controlled by guerrillas, threatening their retreat. Therefore, the Japanese side has released peaceful overtures, requesting that the guerrillas cease military operations, and promising to return to Nanhui City and Datuan Town, continuing to collect various national taxes as usual, and that neither side will attack again, which is equivalent to signing a non-aggression pact. Chinese military commanders such as Yu Taosheng believe that this is a delaying tactic and have ignored it, launching large-scale encirclement tactics.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Reinforcements on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway: According to people from Qingpu, there have been continuous guerrilla battles on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, and the Japanese army has sent many reinforcements in an attempt to carry out their so-called sweeping plan. However, the guerrillas are familiar with the roads, and the Japanese army cannot find them, so this plan to advance and drive the Chinese troops to the west of the Song-Qing Highway has completely failed.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Landings and Searches on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road: The Shanghai Middle School, North Bridge Town, and the towns of Longhua, Meilong, and Xinzhuang on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were originally garrisoned by only a dozen to dozens of Japanese troops. Now, because the guerrilla forces are active in various places, the Japanese side has gradually tightened its defenses. According to people who came to Shanghai from Minhang yesterday, the number of Japanese troops stationed along the way has increased. Sentries have been stationed in Yanpu Town, and the Japanese Navy has landed to conduct searches. A curfew has also been imposed in Zhuanqiao and Xinzhuang areas to prevent guerrillas from attacking the Japanese headquarters.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Expand the Use of Remittances; Payment of Rent and Goods Must Not Be Refused; The Aim Is to Eliminate Premiums and Facilitate Circulation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the requests of 104 industries in the city, cabled the Ministry of Finance to request the elimination of remittance premiums and to promote the use of remittances for paying rent and various goods not purchased with foreign exchange.

<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegram:</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Finance, Chongqing (omitted ten lines). It is found that the current inter-trade remittance method is implemented according to the Ministry of Finance's June telegram. For deposits of less than 500 yuan, legal tender is paid. For those over 500 yuan, legal tender is paid for 500 yuan, and inter-trade remittances are paid for the remainder. Otherwise, legal tender of 500 yuan is paid per week. Originally, it was hoped that this would save legal tender and facilitate commercial circulation. Therefore, remittances must have the same effect and price as legal tender to prevent merchants from having to discount at high prices for purchasing materials and making payments, resulting in more losses and affecting prices, which are soaring day by day. The request of the associations to expand the use of remittances is actually a countermeasure to eliminate discounting. It is proposed that a clear order be issued that the other party must not refuse to accept remittances for the payment of rent and various goods that are not related to foreign exchange, so that the scope of circulation is wider and the commercial circulation is more abundant. The urgency of waiting for orders is overwhelming. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests approval.</p>
<h3>Xian Rice Prices Have Fallen; Yu Qiaqing Plans to Advance 300,000 Yuan to Order Foreign Rice; If Necessary, 1 Million Yuan Can Be Raised</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of white japonica rice in the rice market did not change, while the price of xian rice dropped sharply by about two yuan. According to rice industry insiders, a large amount of Jiangbei rice has arrived in the Pujiang River and is parked at the Qichang Wharf area, not yet across the river. Early rice in Gaoqiao, Pudong, is already ripe. The fullness of the ears of rice and the plumpness of the grains are enough to show a good harvest year. However, it is still early, and the rice grains are not yet firm. In general, villagers are unable to purchase rice due to the high price, so they have to harvest it early for their own consumption. A large number of these new rice grains are broken after being milled by the mill. According to local farmers, a large amount of production will occur in another week. Now, because they are forced by the market price, they have to reluctantly harvest early, which is out of necessity. Observing the current situation, rice prices will gradually decline and will not have unexpected market conditions again.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that, according to a senior official of the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department has requested the cooperation of the Japanese side to allow rice and food to be more freely transported into the two concessions. The Japanese authorities have not yet responded, but the hope for an early response and assistance from the Japanese side remains strong. If the Japanese side provides assistance, the current serious situation can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Rice: Letter Requesting Registration:</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and others sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that since the source of rice for food in the city has become difficult, the price of rice has soared. The high selling price has created an unprecedented record in the history of Shanghai. According to a recent survey, the amount of rice stored in Shanghai is insufficient compared to the number of households in the city. If the upper and middle class citizens do not come up with a proper solution, they will inevitably compete to buy rice at high prices, and the poor will face the danger of starvation in the near future. If this estimate becomes a reality, not only will the trend of grabbing rice inevitably follow, but the municipal political stability will be unimaginable. In view of this, in order to prepare for a rainy day, we have launched the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association to handle the registration and order foreign rice. If the upper and middle class citizens can have their own preparations, they will not compete with the poor for food, and the rising price of rice may be stopped and gradually calmed down. Therefore, our move will not only ensure that those who join the association to order foreign rice will not have to worry about running out of rice, but also help the poor. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be done by a small number of people. It requires the joint efforts of people from all walks of life to achieve optimistic results. We hereby send a special letter to your association, asking you to forward it to the trade associations, informing their members to rise up and go to the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association to register and order. When the news spreads, people's hearts will be at ease, and it will be beneficial to the public, which is not insignificant. Your association has always been enthusiastic about public welfare for the citizens, and we hope that you will be happy to comply with our request and see it through together. Sincerely, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Yu Qiaqing, Gui Yanfang, Guo Shun, Zhang Jiguang, Wang Yuqing, and others.</p>
<p>Registration Orders Reach 800 Bags:</p>
<p>A reporter from Daguang News Agency learned from the Certified Public Accountants Association yesterday that since the initiators Yu Qiaqing and others entrusted the association to handle the registration of foreign rice orders, yesterday, the following requested to order: (1) Chinese Mental Hospital 50 bags, (2) Huisheng Match Printing Factory 50 bags, (3) Chunhe, Yong Woolen Cloth Shop 50 bags, (4) Yixin Educational Supplies Store 50 bags, (5) Hongtai Shop 50 bags, (6) Qiaomao Cold Steam Company 100 bags, (7) Siming Hospital 100 bags, (8) Yuxin Baoji Stationery Store 50 bags, totaling 500 bags. The total number of orders placed before yesterday has reached 800 bags. It is also understood that the member banks of the Bankers Association and the money shops of the Money Shop Association have begun to handle the procedures for purchasing foreign rice and will complete the purchase in the next few days. Once the total number is collected, it will be registered with the Certified Public Accountants Association.</p>
<p>Designated Banks to Collect Rice Payments:</p>
<p>In addition, Gui Yanfang told a Daguang News Agency reporter that the purpose of initiating the purchase of foreign rice this time is to relieve the food shortage of Shanghai citizens, so as to make the inventory sufficient and suppress the rise in rice prices. All rice purchase funds have been advanced by the initiator Yu Qiaqing, totaling 300,000 yuan. If necessary, 1 million yuan can be raised. All industries that entrust the purchase of foreign rice must pay half of the rice price in advance and request the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to collect it on behalf of the organization, which will issue a receipt.</p>
<p>Rice Grab in Pudong Intensifies:</p>
<p>The rice grabbing trend in Pudong is intensifying. At around 9:00 PM the night before last, dozens of poor men and women, holding cloth bags or rice baskets, broke open the door of Yuan Lai Rice Shop at No. 78 Land Temple in Yangjiazhai and grabbed 900 empty rice bags, 10 yuan in legal tender, 7 dan of broad beans, and 30 short shirts and pants. Also, Wu Tai Rice Shop on Dongchang Road was stormed by 70 or 80 men, women, and children, who, unable to buy rice, grabbed dozens of bags of flour. The local "organization" organized a sale at a fair price to cover up the rice grabbing trend.</p>
<h3>Implementing Direct Property Tax; Inheritance Tax to Be Levied; Implementation of Separate Collection and Receipt; Effective Date of the Public Treasury Law Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>After the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Inheritance Tax with 24 articles on October 6, 1938, the Ministry of Finance, considering this tax to be an important backbone in the direct tax system, prepared a draft of the Implementing Regulations on Inheritance Tax in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is currently being deliberated by the Legislative Yuan and will be formulated and promulgated in the near future. It has now been decided to levy the tax on a scheduled basis after the formulation and promulgation of the Implementing Regulations. As for the matters that should be prepared, such as the uniform investigation of property owner names and the registration of household registration, they are all being promoted in preparation for implementation. As for the most burdensome inheritance evaluation method for collecting inheritance tax, as well as the forms used for collection, draft plans have been formulated. In the future, the implementation methods will be carried out in phases and regions.</p>
<p>Public Treasury Law Has Been Scheduled for Implementation:</p>
<p>The essence of the independent system of separation of collection and receipt is that the tax authorities are only responsible for collection, while the banks acting as public treasuries are responsible for receiving tax payments and directly depositing them into the public treasury. They are independent of each other. Now, after the Ministry of Finance has taken into account the actual situation, it has decided on the effective date and area: (1) The National Treasury, except for Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces, which will be postponed for the time being, and those guerrilla areas or areas close to the war zone where there are special obstacles in fact, which will be temporarily adapted by the public treasury authorities, will be implemented from October 1st of this year; (2) Provincial, municipal, and county treasuries will be implemented from January 1, 1940. Remote provinces and counties or areas with special circumstances may report their difficulties to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for consideration and postponement before January 1, 1940, and implemented on April 1, 1940, or July 1, 1940.</p>
<p>Establishing Training Institute to Promote New Taxes:</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the Central Direct Tax Personnel Training Class is to use new talents to handle new taxes, as a cadre to promote new taxes, and to quickly lay a solid foundation for the tax system. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. The Ministry of Finance has taken a further step to promote the spirit of this examination and training by setting up a Financial Personnel Training Institute to conduct large-scale training, in order to complete the mission of thoroughly reforming the personnel aspects of financial administration. The institute is divided into senior and junior levels, and each level is divided into tax, accounting, statistics, and banking groups. The senior groups require a bachelor's degree in economics, finance, accounting, banking, or commerce, while the junior groups require a degree from a vocational school, senior commercial school, or senior high school. After completing the training, they will be assigned to serve in various financial and tax agencies and the Central Bank. The third phase has recruited 200 senior students and 100 junior students.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Increase the Number of Main Battle Ships; Arriving in the Far East to Increase Defenses; Equipped with 13.5-Inch to 15-Inch Guns; British Ship Mofu Studies in the Chuandiao Strait</h3>
<p>With the European situation tense, Hong Kong is in a state of war, and the financial market is almost at a standstill. Women and children of various countries have also been ordered to prepare for evacuation. It is rumored that more than 10,000 Japanese troops have been concentrated in Shenzhen, which faces Kowloon across the sea. In addition to closing the Li Yu Men port, the Hong Kong authorities will also close the Ye Xi Kou Jishui Men. The British fleet stationed in Hong Kong goes out to sea from time to time. It is heard that in order to protect British interests in the Far East, the British government will continue to transfer a strong British main battle fleet to the Far East for defense in the near future. These battle ships are all equipped with large guns ranging from 13.5 inches to 15 inches in diameter. At least four to six battle ships will be transferred to the Far East, and Singapore and Hong Kong will be used as bases. According to the Hong Kong naval authorities, the British ship "Mofu" is scheduled to practice in the East Boliao Strait on the 24th and 25th of this month, firing main guns with a diameter of 6 inches. The target is the lower tail bay opposite Boliao Island, and several torpedo boats will shuttle back and forth. The British aircraft carrier "Eagle" rushed back from Singapore to Hong Kong to assist in defense.</p>
<h3>America's Shortest Shortwave Machine; Broadcasting to the Far East; Shanghai Time Is 4:00 AM Midnight</h3>
<p>The latest shortwave machine of the American International Golden Gate Exposition on Pearl Island, San Francisco, call sign W6XBE, channel 9.530 kHz (or 31.048 meters), is scheduled to broadcast the latest news to the Far East today. The content includes music, British market news, dance and other programs, broadcasting for seven consecutive days. The Shanghai listening time is 4:00 AM midnight.</p>
<h3>British Naval Commander Maule Goes to Weihaiwei Aboard HMS Cornflower, Sailing North for Patrol; Huth's Private Yacht to Sail to Qingdao Today</h3>
<p>Amidst the tense situation in Shanghai, the movements of British warships have become increasingly frequent, a matter that deserves considerable attention. The cruiser HMS Cornflower, berthed at the British naval pontoon, suddenly weighed anchor and sailed out at 4:30 PM on the 25th, replaced by the new British "D" class destroyer HMS Duncan. It is learned that after leaving the naval pontoon, the Cornflower sailed north at 5:00 PM, carrying Rear Admiral Maule, commander of the British Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, to Weihaiwei for patrol. Furthermore, Rear Admiral Huth, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet's private yacht, the "Isabel," has completed inspection at the naval dockyard and sailed to the sea for a test voyage on the 25th. The results were reportedly excellent, and the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is rumored that the ship is scheduled to sail to Qingdao today to meet with Rear Admiral Huth, who is currently inspecting Qingdao, to await orders.</p>
<h3>People from Hong Kong Come to Shanghai in Succession, All Ships Fully Loaded with Passengers; Evacuees Also Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The relationship between Germany and Poland is becoming increasingly tense, and the European situation is extremely dangerous. War is on the verge of breaking out. According to sources in the shipping industry, there has been a significant increase in the number of passengers coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong in the past three days. Ships arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong are fully loaded with Chinese and Western passengers, mostly women and children. This is because Hong Kong is deeply concerned about</p>
<p>the outbreak of war</p>
<p>and is making strong preparations for war. Therefore, Chinese and Western merchants in Hong Kong are sending their families to Shanghai to avoid accidents. It is reported that the cost of living there is even higher than in Shanghai. When the Hong Kong dollar was at its highest, it was worth 4.40 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>Although it has fallen slightly</p>
<p>it still requires 3.70 yuan in legal tender, three times more expensive than a year ago. All expenses are calculated in Hong Kong dollars, which invisibly increases the price significantly. Many wealthy people from various war zones in the country went to Hong Kong to take refuge after the war, and their living expenses have been increasing daily.</p>
<p>Most Feeling Painful</p>
<p>are now returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong to reduce their burden. The current situation in Hong Kong is very stable. Although there are many rumors and the situation is slightly tense after the Japanese army occupied Shenzhen, people's hearts are extremely calm and composed. The authorities are making strong preparations for war and are determined to defend Hong Kong Island.</p>
<h3>Tram Fare Tickets Restricted in Issuance, Circulation Exceeds 50,000 Yuan; Fractional Tickets to Be Recalled Immediately</h3>
<p>The two concession tram companies in this city previously issued a type of tram fare ticket due to the extreme shortage of copper coins. Because these fare tickets were more convenient to use than postage stamps, the market mostly refused to use postage stamps and used these fare tickets for payment, resulting in a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply. To date, the tram fare tickets in circulation on the market amount to more than 50,000 yuan. It is now learned that the tram company is restricting the issuance of fare tickets because the Central Bank's fractional currency notes are about to be issued. Passengers without tram fare tickets will not be given change when purchasing tickets and will be stopped from purchasing tickets, forcing them to get off the tram.</p>
<h3>Cruise Ships Arrive in Shanghai; Italian Ship Stops at Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf, Carrying Over 600 Jewish People</h3>
<p>The British Company's regular mail ship, the "Kassaiqi" (transliteration), came to Shanghai from London earlier this month on its way to Japan. It is now scheduled to return to Shanghai today, arriving at 1:00 PM and berthing at pontoons 11 and 12. It is scheduled to weigh anchor and return to Europe next Tuesday (the 29th) at 2:00 PM. This ship has 31 passengers on its return trip from Japan. After arriving in Shanghai, they will transfer to a smaller boat prepared by the company and land at the New Customs Wharf around 1:00 PM. Furthermore, the American President Lines' President Cleveland arrived in Shanghai from Los Angeles on the 17th of this month and sailed to Hong Kong and Manila. It is now learned that the ship has returned from Manila and passed Hong Kong yesterday. It is scheduled to arrive at the port at noon tomorrow (the 28th) and berth at pontoons 12 and 13. The company has prepared the "Scott" small boat to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 12:30 PM tomorrow to pick up passengers. The passengers will land at the New Customs Wharf at 2:00 PM. The large ship is scheduled to weigh anchor at 7:00 AM on the 29th and sail to Japan, passing through Honolulu and San Francisco before returning to Los Angeles. The small boat "Scott" is scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 1:00 AM on the 29th (i.e., midnight on the 28th). Furthermore, the Italian Mail Ship Company's Far East Express Line's "Conte Rosso" and "Conte Verde" are scheduled to enter the dock for repairs after returning to Europe. The "Giuliana" (transliteration) from the North Africa Line will replace one trip. This ship came to Shanghai once in mid-May of this year and is now making its second trip. It is scheduled to arrive at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf in Hongkou at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The company's disembarkation procedures for passengers remain the same as before. Foreigners will disembark at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf, while Chinese passengers will transfer to a small boat to reach the New Customs Wharf at noon. It is rumored that this ship will again carry over 600 Jewish people, who will stay in Shanghai for two days and then depart on the 30th, returning to Venice via Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. The next trip may not come to Shanghai because the "Conte Verde" will be repaired and return to service in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Merchants Issue International Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets, 300,000 Yuan Per Issue to Help Local Charity Groups</h3>
<p>The International Disaster Relief Lottery, registered with the Portuguese Consulate, has been prepared and will begin issuing tickets in the coming days. The amount of tickets issued is said to be 300,000 yuan per issue.

<h3>Coal Ball Guild Discusses Trade Methods, Market Arrival Is Extremely Crowded, Market Price Suppression Situation Improves</h3>
<p>The coal market situation has improved due to the arrival of various goods and the suppression of prices. The Rong gang is active, and more goods have been added to this street, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of transactions. However, the large-scale shipment of foreign coal to Shanghai and the outflow of resources are indeed noteworthy. Hongji coal powder has not continued to rise, and the cost of the coal ball industry has been reduced. The Coal Ball Guild has discussed the trade methods for the industry: (1) The wholesale price of coal balls produced by each factory shall be 62 yuan in national currency; (2) The retail price per dan (calculated at 100 city catties) shall be 3.40 yuan in national currency; (3) The delivery fee per ton shall be 1.60 yuan in national currency; (4) New stack orders shall be temporarily suspended from today; (5) Outstanding stack orders shall be notified by each factory to customers to clear them within a time limit; (6) Delivery vehicles for returned coal powder shall not be brought back to the factory on behalf of customers; (7) If the returned coal powder is delivered to each factory by customers and found to be dry and free of mixed debris, coal balls shall be exchanged at 80% of the price.</p>

All large and small dance halls in the city, such as the Lido, Paramount, Metropole, and Ciro's, will also mobilize to hold events in rotation on a regular basis. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively participate at that time, both enjoying entertainment and contributing to a righteous cause, truly achieving two goals at once.</p>

This is the second flag-flying day after the flag-flying dispute (the first flag-flying day was the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government). Companies, businesses, households, schools, etc. in the city originally intended to fly the flag for one day to show their celebration, but due to the current situation, or for fear of misunderstandings, the police authorities of the concessions notified various businesses, etc. at around 5:00 PM yesterday, hoping to stop the flag-flying activity.</p>
<p>Member Bank</p>

<h3>Famous American Writer Arrives in Shanghai; Impression of the Garden Bridge; Expresses Emotion at the Sight of Chinese Forced to Bow, Says If They Were Americans, They Would Harbor Hatred for Life</h3>
<p>Author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People"</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that Dale Carnegie, the famous author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People," arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 25th) after traveling in Japan. A reporter interviewed him today (the 26th) and asked what he had noticed during his brief time in Shanghai. Carnegie said that if the Chinese people bowing to Japanese sentries at the Garden Bridge were Americans, they would harbor hatred for the Japanese for life. Self-esteem is dynamite. If you strike a person's self-esteem, you cannot influence them with friendship. He does not know how Orientals feel or react when forced to bow, but he knows how Americans would feel if they encountered this.</p>
<p>Short Stay, Scheduled to Return to America</p>
<p>Carnegie did not attempt to influence the Japanese while in Japan. He said that he was not proficient in Japanese and could not do anything about it. Carnegie also said that he saw few signs of war on his trip to China from Japan, and that he felt this trip was much safer and more comfortable than driving from New York to Chicago. He will stay in Shanghai briefly, planning to buy some goods and sightsee, and then buy a ticket back to Chicago on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Refuses to Criticize German-Soviet Pact</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter about the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Carnegie refused to criticize it. He said that he felt he was not qualified to talk about international relations. He himself has some small problems and does not know how to solve them, so how can he express opinions on these world events? He felt honored to be asked these questions, but he believed that news reporters were more qualified to talk about these events than he was.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Discuss, Be Friends with Japan</p>
<p>The reporter asked Carnegie for tips on how Britain could try to befriend Japan. Carnegie said that he hoped the reporter would tell him. He felt that he was only qualified to talk about three things he had studied: one was public speaking, which he had studied for 25 years and written a book about; two was the life and experiences of Lincoln, which he had studied for three years and written a biography of Lincoln;</p>
<p>New Book Success, Great Surprise</p>
<p>Third, he spent fifteen years studying human relations and wrote "How to Win Friends and Influence People." He was truly surprised by the success of this book, because in Carnegie's opinion, his efforts in writing this book were less than those in the biography of Lincoln. However, others felt interested in the book, which is a good reason for it to be widely circulated. As a result of Carnegie's study of public speaking, he is currently planning to write another book, "How to Develop Self-Confidence and Overcome Fear," but he always finds it difficult to start writing, so he cannot say for sure when it will be published.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Imported Goods Is Customs' Authority; Local Authorities May Not Arbitrarily Detain Goods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the governments of all provinces, saying, "Approved is the telegram from the Ministry of Finance, according to the report from the Inspector General of Customs transferred by the Zhejiang Customs, stating that local authorities in Zhenhai want to inspect Chinese and foreign merchant ships and civilian ships according to the regulations for prohibiting Japanese goods, and have already occurred incidents of detaining ships and goods. The Ningbo local authorities are also about to adopt the same actions, etc. The Ministry requests verification and handling of the above. It is found that imported goods have always been inspected by the Customs before the ships and goods leave. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the Prohibition Regulations, regarding the inspection and detention of Japanese goods entering through Customs checkpoints, it is within the authority of the Customs. As for Japanese goods that have already been imported or transferred to the interior after import, the inspection, identification, registration, and disposal matters shall be the responsibility of the local competent authorities, and the goods detained by the Customs shall still be sent to the local competent authorities for disposal. Hereafter, all local authorities must comply with the regulations when prohibiting Japanese goods and shall not arbitrarily inspect and detain imported goods that have not been unloaded to avoid disturbances."</p>
<h3>French Concession Agencies Increase Salaries</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities have decided to increase the salaries of their staff in various agencies from this month. Western staff will receive a 70% salary increase, and Chinese staff will receive a 40% salary increase, plus an additional rice subsidy of 5 yuan. It is rumored that the salary increase plan will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Divorced Couple in Litigation</h3>
<p>The woman accuses the man of embezzlement. Zhao Lianyang, a woman from Yuyao, is 30 years old this year and has an attractive appearance. Ten years ago, she was married to Zheng Yanling, a Ningbo native who runs the Weishun Knitting Factory at No. 1 Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, through a matchmaker. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious, but later, Zhao became restless and committed adultery with her brother-in-law, Fan Bingxing. Zheng discovered this, and Zhao wrote a letter of repentance. The couple reunited. In May of last year, Zhao again committed adultery with Cui Xiangshun, a traveling salesman at her husband's knitting factory, and was again discovered by Zheng. Zhao requested to be allowed to write another letter of repentance, and Zheng was unwilling to pursue the matter and allowed Zhao to renew herself. Unexpectedly, Zhao's lascivious heart did not diminish. In the autumn of last year, she again committed adultery with Cui Xiangshun. Therefore, Zheng reported to the French Concession Police, who detained Zhao and sent her to the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, where she was sentenced to four months in prison. The case has been finalized. Later, the two parties were involved in litigation, and a judgment was made allowing the two parties to divorce. Recently, Zhao again hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zheng Yanling of embezzling over 2,300 yuan in savings. The case was heard by Judge Miao Qingbang in the Fifth Criminal Court at approximately 3:00 PM yesterday. Zhao Lianying and Zheng Yanling both appeared in court in person. They each held their own views in court. Zhao insisted that Zheng embezzled the 2,300 yuan in savings, while Zheng said that he did have the savings, but had handed them over to the plaintiff in May of last year. After verifying the statements, the court decided to reschedule the hearing for September 5 to summon witnesses and subpoena documents for further questioning.</p>
<h3>German Ships Stop Sailing to Japanese Ports; One British Ship Has Been Requisitioned by the British Government</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the Blue Funnel Line's regular ship, the Antenor, carrying passengers from Shanghai, has been requisitioned by the British government. Furthermore, the Far East has seen another sign of the impact of current political developments, namely that ships of the German Rickmers Line (transliteration) have announced that they will not sail to Japanese ports. It is noted that the Antenor left Shanghai several days ago and sailed from Hong Kong on Wednesday. It is not yet known whether it was requisitioned at sea or upon reaching Singapore, but it is heard that passengers will disembark in Singapore. Although Rickmers Line ships do not sail to Japan, German ships of the Norddeutscher Lloyd and Hamburg America Line have not changed their scheduled routes and continue to sail to Japanese ports.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Flood; Shanghai Ships Plan to Sail to Dalian; Navigation Channels Unrecognizable, Likely to Be Forced to Suspend Navigation; Wusong Estuary Water Level Also Especially High</h3>
<p>The foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, including the Xin Anna, Xin Anfu, Xin Xiangtai, Hongshun, An Sui, Xin An, Tai Shun, Sheng Jing, etc., have all sailed from Shanghai to Tianjin one after another in recent days. According to telegrams received by American firm Wilh. Wilhelmsen and others, Tianjin has been experiencing heavy flooding for days, especially in the Japanese Concession, with the deepest areas reaching over 13 feet and the shallowest areas being over three feet. The severity of the flood is even greater than the Hankou flood of 1931, making it impossible for foreign ships to berth and unload passengers and cargo. Furthermore, the Hai River banks from Tanggu to Zizhu Forest are completely submerged, making it almost impossible to identify the navigation channels, so navigation is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Ships Temporarily Docked at Dagu and Tianjin</p>
<p>After sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin one after another, the Xin Anna and other ships were unable to berth and unload cargo due to the heavy flooding. In addition to telegraphing their respective companies for instructions, they have all temporarily docked at Dagu and Tianjin Zizhu Forest. The Xin Anna, Xin Anfu, and Hongshun are docked at Dagu, while the Xin Antai, An Sui, and Xin Xiangtai are docked at Zizhu Forest. The Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Wilh. Wilhelmsen, Taichangxiang Steamship Company, and Weitai Steamship Company have all published announcements stating that the ships will sail to nearby Dalian to unload cargo, but are awaiting notification from the passenger and cargo owners. A decision will be made at 2:00 PM on the 28th on whether to sail to Dalian or return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tianjin Route to Be Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, due to the heavy flooding in Tianjin, the ships are unable to berth and unload cargo, and the losses from being stranded at Dagu or Tianjin are quite large. Therefore, if the flood does not recede, the ships may be forced to temporarily suspend operations and change to other routes, and will resume operations after the flood has receded. However, it is heard that the Swire Shipping's Shuntian and Shengjing ships may still be operating.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Banks Damaged</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level is still flooding. Recently, ships traveling along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as those passing through Jiaoshan and Madang, have not dared to navigate at night. It is heard that many of the riverbanks have been damaged, making navigation extremely difficult. It is also learned that the water level outside the Wusong estuary is also particularly high due to the discharge of Yangtze River floodwaters.</p>
<h3>Jewish Immigration; Principles Determined; Japanese Side Studying Plans</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of immigration for Jewish refugees forced to come to Shanghai from Central Europe, a board of directors consisting of one representative each from the French Consul General, the Japanese Consul General, the Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Jewish Refugee Association has been formed to discuss immigration issues. It is heard that the board of directors held a meeting on the 15th to discuss the issue of Jewish refugees' immigration and the proposed plans. The Japanese side is studying the matter, and no decision has been made at the meeting. According to Mr. Mai, representative of the Jewish Refugee Association, the principle of admitting refugees coming to Shanghai has been approved, but no decision has been made regarding the large number of refugees who will arrive in Shanghai on Sunday. He hopes that a solution can be reached at that time.</p>

After the incident, Zhang Bingsheng, the owner of Quick Joy Film Company, knowing that his negligence was significant, surrendered himself to the French Concession Police. After investigation by the French Concession authorities, he was prosecuted for crimes such as negligent homicide and endangering public safety. The families of the victims, Zhang Baotang (a lawyer), filed an incidental civil suit, requesting compensation for losses and consolation money totaling over 7,300 yuan. The case was concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang of the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, who ordered the defendant Zhang Bingsheng to pay a bond of 4,000 yuan to be released on bail while awaiting sentencing. Yesterday was the date for the sentence to be issued. Judge Miao cited the First Criminal Court, announced the termination of the debate, and questioned the defendant Zhang Bingsheng in detail for a long time, but Zhang Bingsheng insisted that he was not at home when the fire occurred. After verifying the statements, the court ordered the debate to be terminated and announced the judgment in court.

<h3>Startling Bloodshed on Avenue Joffre; Wang Jilu Shot; Wang Currently the Business Director of the China Times; Bullet in Neck, Life May Be Safe; Cause Unknown, Stray Bullet Injured Two Others</h3>
<p>At 8:30 AM yesterday, Wang Jilu, the business director of the China Times in this city, was suddenly shot near his residence on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, suffering a bullet wound. The details obtained are recorded below.</p>
<p>Business Director Surprised and Uneasy</p>
<p>Wang Jilu, a native of Songjiang who is currently the business director of the China Times, is 53 years old and lives at No. 12, Alley 1232 (i.e., Yingcun), Route Cardinal Foch at the intersection of Route Sayzoong. Because Wang's income at the China Times is very low, his finances are very tight. He usually travels on foot, but sometimes he is picked up and dropped off by the newspaper's vehicles.</p>
<p>Walking on Foot, Ambushed at the Alley Entrance</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after Wang finished breakfast, he put on a dark gray silk long gown and white gold-rimmed glasses. Because he was obese and the weather was hot, he did not wear a hat on his bald head. He slowly walked out of the alley, unaware that someone had been lying in wait there, preparing to stage this horrific bloodbath.</p>
<p>Three Shots Fired, Bullet in the Neck</p>
<p>When Wang left the alley and walked east, he had not walked far, just as he was walking to the border between No. 1222A Avenue Joffre (Avenue Cardinal Foch) and the Huang Yongtai Chinese Medicine Shop, a short-sleeved thug suddenly jumped out from behind him and fired three shots at Wang. Wang was caught off guard, and the first bullet hit his left rear neck. Because they were very close, the force of the bullet was extremely strong, passing directly through the left side of his nose and face.</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Through Door, Injuring Pedestrians</p>
<p>When Wang was shot, he was still conscious and knew that something was wrong. He quickly fled into the Lafaille Dry Cleaning Shop. Seeing Wang escape, the gunman chased after him and fired two more shots. One bullet pierced the shop's glass door, and the other bullet flew elsewhere, hitting He Hongliang (31 years old, living at No. 19 Fuxingfang on that road), a clerk at the Bajia Shoe Store, in the leg. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the gunman abandoned Wang, mixed into the crowd, and fled. This was because it was the time when the small vegetable market was opening.</p>
<p>Escaped Into Shop, Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>After Wang escaped into the shop, he moved to the ironing room behind the shop. Blood was flowing profusely. Many of the shop's employees were greatly alarmed and fled. One employee sounded the alarm. When the police arrived after receiving the news, the ironing room was covered in blood, and many of the clothes that had been ironed on the ironing board were also covered in blood. They immediately took Wang and the pedestrian injured by the stray bullet to Guangci Hospital. However, Wang's family, although nearby, did not know that Wang had been shot on the way.</p>
<p>Did Not Receive Any Warning Beforehand</p>
<p>Although Wang's injuries were serious, his condition was still good after treatment, and because the bullet had been removed, his life may be safe. Wang's family is very small, with only Wang's wife, three children, and one maid. According to an announcement by the French Police, in addition to the passerby He Hongliang, Shen Genxin, a 15-year-old child from Pudong, was also injured in the head by a stray bullet when the shooting occurred. It is investigated that Wang was suddenly shot and ambushed this time and did not receive any warnings beforehand. The police are currently investigating the cause.</p>
<h3>True Cholera Continues to Be Discovered; Two More People Confirmed at the Epidemic Hospital</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, cholera is continuing to spread in Shanghai. In addition to the still-being-tested patient's feces not yet reported by the Shanghai Municipal Council's laboratory, two more people have been confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Council's laboratory. One is Wang Afu, male, 41 years old, a ship crew member at the Huidefeng Transportation Company, No. 3 Yangjingbang Road. The second is Zhang Shenshi, female, 48 years old, a maid at a cigarette paper shop, No. 44 Julai Road. Both of the above were sent to the hospital for treatment on August 25 and have not yet been discharged.</p>
<h3>Lingering Heat</h3>
<p>The autumn sun is wreaking havoc on this city, the heat is extreme, and there is no sign of it abating. In recent days, the sun has been blazing, and the midday temperature has risen to over ninety degrees. It is also very sultry. Although there was a shower of rain yesterday, it did not reduce the heat. Furthermore, according to records, the weather in this city is usually coolest in August, with the highest temperature of the month being only ninety-four degrees, and the lowest dropping to seventy degrees point five, with an average high of only eighty-six degrees point seven. Also, there were sixteen days of rain throughout the month, so the climate is naturally cooler.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Hangs Herself</h3>
<p>The newly built Mei Dong New Village houses on Avenue Edward VII have been completed, but the bamboo fences have not yet been removed. Yesterday morning, around five o'clock, a man discovered an old woman, nearly sixty years old, hanging herself with a rope between the bamboo fences. He immediately called for workers and others to help rescue her. Because it was still early, she was fortunately saved and woke up. The old woman's hair was already gray. She claimed her name was Yang Wang, and she lived in a nearby neighborhood. She has a husband and a son who works away from home. Because the sub-landlord raised the rent, she became angry and resorted to this desperate measure.</p>
<h3>Wife Stricken with Illness Returns to Hometown; Dove Occupies Magpie's Nest; Recovery Leads to Love River Turning into Sea of Vinegar; Report of Arrest for Adultery and Public Prosecution for Adultery</h3>
<p>Zhang Guolian, a small proprietor of a tea house at No. 1 North Fujian Road, Suzhou native, has long been addicted to singing and dancing. Last autumn, he developed a love affair with Hu Ying, a dancer from Dalu Dance Hall, whose registered residence was Haimen. They began living together, flying as a couple, like a real husband and wife. In December, after Zhang married Wang Ziying, a graduate of Mingde Girls' Middle School, he remained deeply in love with the dancer. He initially tried his best to appease his wife, so he never revealed any flaws. However, Ziying contracted a contagious disease, with sores and scars all over her body, causing both pain and itching. Suspecting something, she questioned him, which angered Zhang. He then changed his attitude and turned love into hate. Ziying, unable to bear his violence, returned to her mother's home. After her illness was cured, her father asked Zhang to welcome her back. However, Zhang ignored her. Ziying, however, did not want to stay at her mother's house for long, guarding an empty room and wasting her youth. Therefore, on the ninth of this month, she returned to her husband's home at No. 5, Lane 365, Shanhai Guan Road (i.e., Yulin Lane). She intended to continue their sweet married life with Zhang. Unexpectedly, upon entering, she saw Hu Ying in the room, intimately whispering sweet words. Since Ziying had returned to her hometown, Zhang had brought back Taoye, and the dove had occupied the magpie's nest, not just for a day or two. That day, Zhang could not have foreseen his wife's sudden return and was unable to hide his lover, causing the two beauties to meet face to face, stirring up a sea of vinegar. At that time, Ziying quarreled with Zhang and, filled with resentment, returned to her mother's home. Until six o'clock in the morning on the fifteenth, anticipating that the couple's sweet dream would be in full swing, she reported it to the Xin Zha police station. The chief dispatched detectives to Zhang's house for investigation. They found Zhang and Hu Ying lying in the same bed in their undergarments. They were both arrested and taken back to the police station. Both confessed to adultery. The police then dismissed the case and filed a public prosecution for adultery against the man and woman to the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning, the two defendants were summoned for trial. First, Zhang Guolian reported the case. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, explained the case. Then, Zhang Wang Ziying described the events in detail, saying that she and Zhang were cousins ​​and married. Now that Zhang has committed adultery, she requested that he be detained and that Hu Ying, who had not been summoned, be arrested and punished. She also hired a lawyer to file an additional private lawsuit, demanding compensation for damages of three thousand yuan. Judge Meng then questioned Zhang Guolian, who confessed that he had met Hu Ying in August of last year. Now, the woman and her mother have moved from No. 13 Gordon Road, Wuding Road, to Jia Yu Road in Hongkou. The court decided to notify them to surrender themselves. The court then adjourned the hearing until next Thursday.</p>
<h3>Yang Zaishan Assassination Case: Fan Falin Surrenders; Confesses to Grudges from Joint Transportation Company with Yang; Court Orders Temporary Detention, Rescheduling for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Yang Zaishan, or Yang Zaisan, a native of Changyinsha, sixty-three years old this year, was suddenly shot in the back by Xu Zimao, a native of Siyang, in front of the Juyuan Pavilion Restaurant next to Baoyu Lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession, around twelve o'clock on April 5th of this year. Because the bullet jammed and did not come out, Yang was fortunately not injured. The detectives arrested Xu and sent him to the Second Special Court. The French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against him for attempted murder. Judge Liao Yanting questioned Xu, who confessed that he was acting on orders from his superiors to kill Yang. The plaintiff, Yang Zaishan, claimed that Fan Falin owed him more than two thousand yuan when they jointly established a shipping business last year. Because he demanded repayment, they became enemies, and he incited someone to commit the crime. He also implicated Xiong Guisong, who was raised by him and showed ingratitude. As a result, Xu Zimao was sentenced to five years in prison for attempted murder. All details were reported in this newspaper. Now, Fan Falin (thirty-five years old, native of Haimen, residing at No. 216 Xuhong Road in the Chinese-administered area of ​​Shanghai) surrendered himself to the French police station the day before yesterday. The chief detained him and sent him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Miao interrogated him. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the French Concession authorities, explained the case, saying that the defendant was involved in the attempted murder case and surrendered himself, requesting temporary detention and rescheduling for further investigation. According to Fan Falin's confession, he and Yang Zaishan had jointly established a transportation company, but later had disputes over accounts and broke up unhappily. After the court verified the confession, it ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Wife, New Love</h3>
<p>Pu Zengsan, a native of Wuxi, thirty-eight years old this year, recently abandoned his wife, Jiang (also a native of Wuxi, thirty-one years old this year), and cohabited with his concubine, Pu Danan, also known as Lu (twenty-three years old this year), at No. 51 Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession, where their love flourished. Recently, Jiang found out about her husband's whereabouts and, because her husband had abandoned her for thirteen months, went to No. 51 Hengmao Lane the day before yesterday to find her husband and demand living expenses. She was beaten severely by Pu and his concubine. Jiang, unwilling to accept this, reported it to the French police station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Pu Zengsan and his concubine, Pu Danan. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed charges of assault and interference with the family. Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated them. The plaintiff, Pu Jiang, recounted the events of being abandoned by her husband and being assaulted. When questioned, Pu confessed that he had taken Lu as his concubine for two years and had even had children. Lu's testimony was the same. The court ordered a rescheduling, asking the victim to have her injuries examined before further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Finance: Emergency in Europe, Sharp Fall in Exchange Rates between England and America, Frequent Hong Kong Calls, British Gold Easier than American</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: Because the exchange rate between England and America lacked support, the exchange rate of England against America plunged 201.2 points. Therefore, the HSBC US exchange rate in this city suddenly contracted by 25, breaking the tight price of 6.3125 yuan on the 11th of this month, and even created an unprecedented low price of 6.0625 yuan. French, Dutch, Luxembourg, Indian, and German exchange rates also contracted accordingly. Other exchange rates, such as British, did not change. The black market for British and American exchange rates opened in the morning, also diverging, showing a situation where British was flat and American was soft. British gold was still 3 shillings 6.25 pence, while the US exchange rate was only 6.75 yuan. After opening, it was still relatively calm. After 9:30, because Hong Kong and Chinese merchants frequently tended to sell, the market situation was quite loose and excessive. At noon, the hardest British gold reached 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate also softened to 7.25 yuan. As a result, the market closed with British gold at 3 shillings 8.75 pence and the US exchange rate at 7.1875 yuan. However, HSBC's appetite was quite good in the middle, and foreign firms were also settling their accounts, so it once turned softer. Ultimately, due to demand not being able to defeat supply, although it lasted for a long time, the September futures also softened accordingly. In the end, the British exchange rate weakened further due to the sharp fall in the British-American mutual exchange rate. However, the August-September swap spread narrowed slightly. It is said that a certain bank would offer half a yuan for US dollars, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 7.8%. However, a large amount of US dollars would be offered at 5.625 yuan. Trading was still strong for half a day. Starting today, there will be two days of closure for the weekend holiday.</p>

The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British gold at 3 shillings 6.25 pence and US exchange rates at 6.75 yuan, compared to the previous closing, British flat and American sharply tighter by 3125. This was due to the sharp contraction in the British-American exchange rate. After opening, Hong Kong first sent a sell order to HSBC for spot British gold at 3 shillings 6.25 pence and spot US exchange rate at 6.6875 yuan. At that time, the situation was still flat.

It is estimated that Hong Kong electricity and Chinese merchants sold to HSBC, Huabi, Youli, and other foreign banks spot British gold at 3 shillings 75 and 875 pence, and then successively sold to HSBC and American banks spot US exchange rates from 6.875 yuan to 7.25 yuan. Later, the hardest British gold bank had even given 3 shillings 90625 pence, and the loosest US wine had also given 7.1875 yuan. Around 9:50, because HSBC's appetite was quite good, it caused various foreign firms to close positions, and the selling wind had also subsided at that time, so the trend turned softer. It is estimated that the foreign firms closed in foreign banks spot British gold at 3 shillings 8125 pence and spot US exchange rates at 7 yuan and 6.9375 yuan. After this, the situation turned calm again. Around 11:00, because Hong Kong electricity came again with a sell order, and at the same time, Chinese merchants started selling again, the situation became loose again. It is estimated that Hong Kong electricity and Chinese merchants sold to HSBC and other foreign banks spot British gold at 3 shillings 875 pence, and also sold to Huabi Youli and other prohibited banks spot US exchange rates at 7.125 yuan and 25 yuan. Near noon, McCalley entered the interbank market for spot British gold at 3 shillings 9025 pence. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 3 shillings 875 pence and US exchange rates at 7.1875 yuan. This month's price is still similar to the spot price. September British gold is 3 shillings 59375 pence and US exchange rates are 6.5625 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the cash market black market situation in this city was turbulent and unstable, still in a state of uncertainty, initially soaring, then plunging wildly, and then trending sideways, with people's hearts uneasy and the market situation chaotic. Initially, due to the tightening of the US exchange rate, the price of pure British gold rose by more than 2 shillings. In a situation of demand without supply, the opening price in the morning was as high as 4,250 yuan. Later, it was heard that the US exchange rate followed the same trend as the British gold, and the guest banks stood by and watched, and the money exchange industry and the gold shop industry competed to sell, and many parties cut positions more closely, and the price plunged to the 4,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, it was blocked by the limit price buyers, and there were many buyers who were optimistic about the European situation, so the price hovered around 4,050 yuan, and then continued to fall by 110 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was closed for the holiday, and it was heard that the off-market price had risen to 4,090 yuan. The trading volume in the first half of the day was 800 to 900 taels.

<p>Cash Prices Fluctuate Unsteadily, Plummeting 110 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially rose sharply due to the news that pure British gold rose sharply by more than 2 shillings, which caused people's hearts to be agitated. For a time, the buying sentiment was quite strong, and sellers were reluctant to sell. The opening price was as high as 115 yuan. A certain silver shop entered the gold shop industry with ten taels, at a price of 4,250 yuan, which was the peak of the day. After the opening, it was heard that after the foreign exchange was sold by the Hong Kong electricity and other companies, the trend was quite loose, and people's hearts suddenly turned downwards.

Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange had slightly softened, which caused the selling wind to stop. A certain money exchange industry absorbed more than 200 taels on behalf of a wealthy merchant, and the price soon rebounded by 70 yuan. The gold shops traded with each other for 30 taels, and the price was 4,070 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange was trending looser again. Although a certain gold shop vigorously entered more than 100 taels, the silver shop industry and retail investors were selling quite actively, which once again lowered the price to 4,030 yuan. Later, the securities industry and the money exchange industry absorbed dozens of taels, and the price was pulled up to 4,060 yuan. Near noon, due to a certain money exchange industry selling on behalf of retail investors, and the foreign exchange was still soft, the price fell by 35 yuan.

The Shanghai Central Bank's listed price of Customs Gold Units also rose sharply, soaring by 3.5 points, reaching 2 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen 9 li. The Shanghai standard gold price soared by 16 yuan 9 jiao, reaching 1,223 yuan 8 jiao. The purchase price of Chinese pure gold rose to 1,228 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>British and Australian Gold Certificates Plummet, Only US Certificates Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the weakening of the foreign exchange market, the cash gold market initially strengthened and then weakened, resulting in a sharp decline. The British and American gold pounds were affected and declined, but the actual supply was scarce, and the demand was very strong. In the midst of the turmoil, hard currency ultimately prevailed. British gold certificates plummeted sharply, and those who had collected them in the past competed to sell, falling by as much as 56 yuan, which was very weak. US gold certificates were welcomed by all countries, and the demand was the strongest. The market price rose alone. Hong Kong and French francs, etc., have weakened with the times. Australian gold certificates have fallen very badly, falling to 39 yuan. Annam, Philippine, etc., have not been affected, and the market situation is stable. The supply and demand of Japanese gold certificates is still strong, and the market situation is trending firm, with the evening price at 1 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen. Korean certificates are stable, still at 1 yuan 0 jiao 2 fen 5 li. Yesterday's market price: British and American gold pounds both fell by 1 yuan, British gold certificates fell by 6 yuan 8 jiao, US gold certificates rose by 2 jiao 5 fen, Hong Kong certificates fell by 2 jiao 9 fen, French franc certificates fell by 1 fen 5 li, Singapore certificates fell by 4 jiao, rupee certificates fell by 6 jiao, German gold certificates fell by 1 jiao, Australian gold certificates fell by 10 yuan, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Lowered by 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange bills initially remained flat and then fell. The rate per thousand yuan was around 185 yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon, due to the holiday for foreign exchange cash, etc., the demand for cash was less, so it gradually decreased to 180 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than the previous day. The interest rate for interbank loans in the money industry association was still listed at 1 jiao 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities: Fewer New Short Positions in Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The securities black market situation yesterday, due to the atmosphere of peace, gradually saw circulation, and people's hearts had a slight sign of awakening. Public bonds therefore gradually recovered and had a little vitality. The price of Class C bonds had already been traded above 43 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen near dusk the day before yesterday, but due to the abundance of floating positions, they were sold off at high prices. Therefore, the market initially traded at 3 yuan 1 jiao in the morning, and then immediately plunged, almost reaching 1 yuan. However, new short positions were extremely rare. People's hearts, at least due to the sudden and unexpected change in German-Soviet relations, paid close attention to the changes in public bonds. Since the rumors of suspension of principal and interest payments on June 19 and 22 and the double blow of bank restrictions on deposits, the bond market has been languishing at a low price of more than 10 yuan for two months. At this time, after the sudden and successive major changes in various countries in the world, the Sino-Japanese issue may take a sharp turn for the worse as a result, and the general public in the market has shifted their attention accordingly. Yesterday's trading saw more active buying, with Runli Hongkang absorbing at high prices, and Yongkang's appetite was also not weak. Tiansheng and Yongfeng, as well as general retail investors, emerged as bulls. The market price was high and then low, but ultimately it still rose by 3 to 5 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 6 yuan 1 jiao.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that the market was sluggish and the prices were unchanged. London rubber reserves are expected to decrease by 4,100 tons this week. The prices of London British Far East companies' stocks on the 25th (Friday) of this month showed mixed gains and losses. McCalley Bank's stock fell slightly by 2 shillings 6 pence, with the price at £6 exactly. HSBC Bank's UK-registered stock rose by £4.5, and the Hong Kong-registered stock rose by £2.5, with the prices both at £70. The above three types all had prices but no market. Culake Linbang Rubber's stock rose by 9 pence, with the price at 15 shillings 9 pence. All the other stocks were unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt prices on the 25th (Friday) of this month remained stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Jinshan Shrimp Tails are Almost Gone</h3>
<p>The supply of Jinshan shrimp tails has been interrupted, causing the bottom stock here to be almost exhausted, and the various companies are not reporting, so the market price has soared. The most recent price was 275 yuan, and now the market is singing higher again at 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: New Buyers are Extremely Scarce, Yarn Prices Decline Again, Shuangma and Tiannv Each Fall by 15 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had soared for seven days, returned to a calm path yesterday. Some of the bulls closed their positions, and there was a slight pullback. However, the downward trend was more gradual. Some believed that there was still no hope for a loosening of raw material prices, so the generally strong held on to the yarn they had stockpiled, and there was no intention of giving up. The market situation was not very volatile. However, the strict guard in Hong Kong and the gathering of Japanese warships had an impact on the purchases of the Hong Kong companies.</p>
<p>The opening momentum of the current yarn was peaceful. Because the previous day's rise was too strong and there were no other changes, new buyers in the market suddenly decreased, and the opening price fell by a large amount of 10 to 20 yuan. The single price of 20-count Bianma Wharf was 625 yuan, and the spot price was 700 yuan. A little later, it fell by another 5 yuan. Not long after, it was said that the exchange rate for drafts denominated in US dollars had been reduced, and the atmosphere suddenly became tight, rebounding by 10 yuan. The single price of Shuangma Wharf was 630 yuan, and the spot price was 710 yuan. Then, although the US dollar was reduced, the pound sterling was extended, and the closing price turned weak again. According to the statistics of half-day transactions, 1,010 bales were traded, and the market prices were 20-count Shuangma falling by 15 yuan, Shuangqiu falling by 19 yuan, and Tiannv falling by 15 yuan. Tomorrow, 30 pieces of cotton yarn will be exported to Qingdao. The amount of purchases by each company is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 280 Same industry: 495</p>
<p>Inland: 235 Total: 1,010</p>
<p>Also, the 27th of this month is the anniversary of Confucius' birthday, which coincides with Sunday. Therefore, the holiday will be made up on Monday, the 28th. The current yarn market will be closed for one day. It is also said that the silver and money industry will also be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Current Raw Cotton Bales Unheard of Trading</h3>
<p>Spot transactions of raw cotton, both domestic and foreign, have completely ceased, with no bales sold. This is due to the fact that factories have ample cotton reserves and do not need to purchase raw materials for the time being. Although yarn prices were flat yesterday and foreign exchange rates eased, the buying interest remained weak. However, market prices remained firm, making it exceptionally difficult for manufacturers to purchase. Inter-dealer transactions have also come to a standstill. Supplies from northern Jiangsu have improved, with 584 bales arriving in Tongzhou and 45 bales from Beisha.</p>
<p>Furthermore, news from Shanghai indicates that due to the soaring overseas cotton market, fewer ships are transporting cotton to China, resulting in thin inventories in Shanghai. Consequently, traders are unwilling to sell, leading to sluggish trading activity. However, they are unwilling to lower prices. As for the factories, they are hesitant to buy due to the unstable situation.</p>
<p>Regarding overseas cotton prices, the New York cotton market opened weak, with speculators selling off. Overseas cotton merchants followed suit, causing prices to gradually decline. As a result, closing prices were down eight to ten points from the previous day. In Liverpool, the cotton market surged by 28 points yesterday due to the European crisis. India also saw a sharp contraction due to the exchange rate with the United Kingdom and the United States, with the cotton market, including forecasts, soaring by over six rupees. The Egyptian cotton market also rose by over 20 points.</p>
<h3>Grains: Lower Prices for Ke Xian Rice, New Jiangbei Xian Rice Arriving in Steady Streams, Jing Rice Briefly Increased Before Returning to Flat</h3>
<p>Du Jing Rice: A total of 36 boats of Songjiang Nangang goods arrived from Hexia. However, due to various reasons, they could only reach Yangjiabo and Dongchang Road in Pudong. Over 2,000 packages of newly harvested Jing Rice arrived by wheelbarrow. The early market opening was still weak, with new and old rice falling by one to two yuan. Although the price drop stimulated activity on the street, prices were still difficult to raise. As for thick rice, it was mostly blocked, with little supply on the market, resulting in a flat situation. In the end, Gao Xi Jing rice sold for 38.5 to 38 yuan, Su Tong San Kun Jing rice for 17 yuan, Jiangxia early and late rice for 35.5 to 35 yuan, original packages for 37 to 36.78 yuan, aged Wu rice for 33.5 to 32 yuan, and new rice for 32.5 yuan, settling at 31 yuan. A total of over 4,600 packages were traded. Change in Yuan was not done.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Arrivals were still strong yesterday, with another 3,000 to 4,000 packages arriving from Jiangjing, Beijing, and Wu areas. Furthermore, new Jiangbei Xian Rice is about to arrive in steady streams, so confidence has returned to flat. Sellers are eager to sell off their goods at lower prices. As a result, new Xian Rice opened at only 33 to 31 yuan, a slight decrease of one to two yuan compared to the previous market price of 34 to 35 yuan. Beijing Wu Xian Rice also experienced a small decline.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: New transactions are sluggish, and spot goods have not been sold. However, it is rumored that the financial sector, during the extension of exchange rates, ordered 1,000 tons of new Saigon rice at a combined price of only 32 to 33 yuan, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>Reduced Demand for Returned Flour, Limited Excitement in Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour prices continued to be flat and soft. Although factory prices have not changed, the prices of returned goods have eased. This is because factories can supply large customers on this street as much as possible and deliver goods at any time. Therefore, this street no longer needs returned goods. Furthermore, the Beiyang gang is quiet due to the Tianjin floods, while the Nanyang gang is even less likely to transport goods due to the current situation. As a result, the prices of returned goods and brands like Ping Chuan have fallen to 0.45 yuan and 0.35 yuan, respectively. Foreign flour has also dropped by about 0.1 yuan. Yesterday, some customers traded at a price of only 6.45 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of wheat is gradually increasing, with large amounts coming from Beijing, Yu, Su, and Xi. This is because since wheat prices rose to 10 yuan, there has been an increasing number of people engaged in the wheat business. Furthermore, due to the unpredictable changes in the international situation, stockpilers are not buying as aggressively as they did in the previous two days, resulting in less excitement in the market. In general, only Fu and Fu factories purchased a total of 12,000 packages of wheat from Suzhou, Guandian, Wuxi, Danyang, Changzhou, Benniu, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, etc. High-quality goods can still maintain a reasonable price, but medium-quality goods have seen a slight price drop of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. There has been no trading among stockpilers.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Decline</h3>
<p>After a sharp drop in soybean oil prices, they had briefly recovered. However, with the tense global situation in the past two days, speculation in the market has somewhat subsided, and buying interest is only greedy. Yesterday, the market sentiment eased, and prices fell by more than one yuan compared to the highest price of the previous day. The underlying trend seems to be returning to normal. A total of 20 barrels of Tianjin soybean oil were traded at a price of 55.5 yuan, and 30 barrels of Dalian oil were also traded at a price of 55.5 yuan. In addition, 180 barrels of Kobe oil arriving from Dalian were priced from 58 yuan, frequently falling to 57.1 yuan, all destined for this street. 100 barrels of Tianjin peanut oil were settled at a price of 72 yuan, which was distributed by the street gang.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Only the American Zhuang Firm Trading in Silk</h3>
<p>The local silk market was very lifeless yesterday. It is impossible to predict the future of the European situation. Foreign firms have also received telegrams from their head offices that shipments to London and Lyon have been temporarily suspended due to the current situation. As a result, most foreign firms have stopped buying European-bound raw silk. The American Zhuang firm only traded 30 dan yesterday, with seventh or eighth grade white factory silk at 3,900 yuan and ungraded, B-grade silk at 3,600 yuan. Although manufacturers are willing to sell, they are hesitant and are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. As a result, telex transactions have decreased significantly.</p>
<p>New York spot prices remained unchanged yesterday. Short-term prices were up 0.05 yuan, while long-term prices were down 5 yuan. Yokohama spot prices were down 10 yuan, and long-term prices were down 5 yuan. Overseas transactions also lacked intensity.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Public Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram, the sugar market did not fluctuate much yesterday. December prices were 6 shillings and 3.5 pence, while March and June of next year were both 6 shillings and 4 pence. The association's publicly announced prices continued to rise, with spot prices up 1.4 yuan. Local godown prices were 42.3 yuan, while foreign godown prices were 41.5 yuan, later rising to 42 yuan. Transshipment goods initially sold for 33.5 yuan, then rose to 34 yuan. Taikoo Che Bai also rose by 1.5 to 1.8 yuan, with West Godown prices at 45.4 to 46 yuan and East Godown prices at 45.2 to 45.8 yuan. West Godown CW marks were 45.7 yuan, CX marks were 45.4 yuan, DV marks were 45 yuan, HX marks were 44.8 yuan, and H marks also rose by 1 yuan to 30 yuan. Dutch red spot prices were 39 yuan, up 2 yuan, and transshipment prices were 32.5 yuan, up 1.9 yuan. Local Mian Bai rose by 1 yuan, Zhen Ji No. 1 was 42 yuan, and local No. 1 Bing rose by 2 yuan to 47.5 yuan. Jing Ming Bing was 49 yuan. National Sugar Dong Xiang red rose by about 3 yuan, opening at 35.5 yuan for 125 packages. Furthermore, Special High was 184 yuan, 36 yuan, and Special High Da Gong powder was over 100 packages, opening at 53.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Stockpilers Release Inventory, White Goods Plunge Again</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate fluctuated abruptly, causing anxiety. Stockpilers released their inventory, and the market turned downward again. Ewo 16-pound plain coarse cloth was still sold at only 20 yuan, with even lower prices for larger quantities. White coarse cloth, fine cloth, and patterned cloth fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan, returning to the prices of the 24th. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth also softened. On this street, over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and flannel were traded. Ningbo merchants purchased 60 to 70 pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, patterned flannel, and coarse cloth. Gan merchants purchased over 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth. Merchants from Yunnan and Guangdong also continued to make purchases. Overseas Nanyang merchants from Singapore and other places purchased several thousand pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, printed cloth, and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to sluggish customer activity, white goods selling became even more intense. Although dyeing factories and wholesalers on this street made small purchases, total transactions for fine cloth and fine twill did not exceed 500 pieces. Fine cloth fell back by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece, and fine twill also dropped by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine cloth sold for 17.85 yuan, and Yang He fine cloth was only 16.75 yuan. Low-priced Yang He fine twill had already sold for over 16.56 yuan. Traders were willing to sell off their goods at lower prices, and the situation was weakening. On the 28th, 50 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Hebei: Longkou Noodles Open at New High Prices</h3>
<p>The arrival of Longkou noodles has been limited recently, and the market is exceptionally firm. Yesterday, it was reported that customer goods opened at over 30 pieces, reaching as high as 115 yuan. The market price was 116 yuan, and despite the unusually high price due to the scarcity of goods, demand remained active.</p>
<h3>Coal: New Arrival of Kailuan Coal: Over 3,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Kailuan bituminous coal was previously scarce, and demand on this street was strong, leading to the clearing of all inventory. Recently, new goods have been arriving in succession. Yesterday, the Ma Le wheel brought another 3,500 tons of Kailuan Tong coal, which was sold by Yitai Xing. The price for Tong coal was 58 yuan per ton at the wharf, and the price for screened lumps was 63 yuan. It is reported that over 1,000 tons have already been sold.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<p>— Gan Lin</p>
<h3>Respect Your Teachers</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Today is the first Teachers' Day as announced by the Ministry of Education. Originally, today was Confucius's birthday anniversary. The Ministry of Education's decision to change Teachers' Day to today is of great significance. I remember that when children went to school in the past, they had to pray to the statue of Confucius or bow to the spiritual tablet of "Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parents, and Teachers." This was an expression of respect for teachers. Later, these rituals gradually ceased with the changes in the school system. Students have also gradually become indifferent to teachers. The relationship between teachers and students does not seem to be taken seriously. However, if children put themselves in the shoes of their teachers, they will realize that teachers are indeed the most respectable people in society.</p>
<p>Teachers sacrifice everything in their lives for their students. They receive only a small remuneration and work diligently for their students all day long. They must endure any annoyance and shoulder any hardship. Teachers must teach and move many stubborn children who refuse to learn, so that they can live in the future and take on the work in society. They are painstakingly carrying out their tasks for the basic education of the nation, for the spirit of the nation, and for the education of the future masters of the country, and their remuneration is so meager. Children, can you not respect your teachers?</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes your teachers, because of mental and material stimulation, their attitude towards you may inevitably make you unhappy, but children, you should also forgive the teachers for this situation. No matter which teacher, his times of distress are always more than his times of happiness. You always understand that there are indeed many affectionate students who appreciate the teachers' spirit of working hard for the students. However, there are also children who do not know what is good for them, who take the teachers' kindness for granted, and who look down on the teachers' work. How can this not make the teachers feel resentful! Dear children, in Guangxi, they have already implemented letters of respect for teachers. On today's Teachers' Day, I would also like to raise the slogan "Respect Teachers" to encourage children. Use the spirit and attitude of respecting Confucius in the past to respect teachers!</p>
<p>Amicis, in his famous book Education of Love, told children that the most respectable name besides their father's name is the name of their teacher. Please reflect again, children, have you ever had a psychology and attitude of contempt for your teacher?</p>
<h3>The Great Confucius</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiuhe</p>
<p>Confucius was a great scholar of ancient China, and also a great scholar of the East. He is revered by the world, along with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle of the West. He was born on the Gengzi day of the tenth month of the 21st year of King Ling of Zhou (August 27, 2462 BC) and died on the Yichou day of the fourth month of the 41st year of King Jing of Zhou (2390 BC). He was 73 years old.</p>
<p>As a child, Confucius loved to display sacrificial vessels and practice sacrificial rituals. As a teenager, he went to the Zhou royal family to study ancient etiquette from Lao Tzu, and also went to the state of Qi to study ancient music from the Grand Master. Throughout his life, he only strived to learn. He said, "If I hear the Tao in the morning, I can die in the evening." "When three people are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." From this, we can see his seriousness in learning.</p>
<p>He was not only a scholar, but also a practical politician and educator. In the tenth year of Duke Ding, he served as the Minister of Justice of the state of Lu. In this year, Duke Ding of Lu and Duke Jing of Qi met at Jiagu (now Laiwu County, Shandong). When Duke Ding set out, Confucius said to Duke Ding, "I have heard that those who have civil affairs must have military preparations; those who have military affairs must have civil preparations. In ancient times, when the dukes went out of the territory, they must have officials to follow them. Please prepare the left and right Sima." Duke Ding thought it was right, so he ordered Confucius to take troops with him. At the meeting, the Qi envoy Lai people came out to play music, and the palace women came out to sing and dance. Confucius sternly stopped them, winning a lot of face for the state of Lu. (When the two countries meet, their positions are equal. If the Qi envoy Lai people play music and dance, then Qi becomes the master and Lu becomes the follower. Wouldn't this be a great loss of face.)</p>
<p>Four years later, Confucius acted as prime minister. After three months, the country was well governed, and the people of Qi were greatly afraid. Therefore, they used a trick to prevent Confucius from exercising his power. At this point, Confucius resigned and retired. Later, he traveled around the states of Qi, Song, Wei, Chen, Cai, and Chu, but he did not meet a confidant. In desperation, he returned to the state of Lu, deleted poems and books, set etiquette and music, praised the Book of Changes, and revised the Spring and Autumn Annals to pass on the way of the former kings. He had 3,000 disciples, of whom 72 were proficient in the six arts.</p>
<p>His spirit of being a person, whether reading or doing things, to the point of joy, he would even forget to eat and sleep, and his sorrows would also be thrown away. He would not even ask himself what stage he had reached. He also had a spirit of not fearing difficulties, being earnest in everything, and not making any pretense. When others thought it was hopeless, he still tried his best to do it. Therefore, people at that time criticized him as a hard-working scholar who "knew that it was impossible to do it, but still did it." The main point of his theory is that people must follow the words "loyalty and forgiveness" in their interactions with each other.</p>
<p>Children, Confucius's birthday is coming again. When we think of his spirit of learning and doing things, we should strive to encourage ourselves and move forward bravely to promote Confucius's theory and save our critically endangered motherland. Work hard! My dear children.</p>
<h3>On the Highway</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—The Thirty-First Record of Ming'er's Misfortune—</p>
<p>The carriage was already packed with people for half an hour, but it was not yet time to leave. The refugees in the car helplessly endured and waited, waited. When the green flag was raised, the car, which had been waiting impatiently, drove out of the station with a whoosh and rushed onto the yellow sand and gravel highway, speeding forward like crazy.</p>
<p>Green mountains, green trees, woodcutters gathering firewood, and pedestrians rushing on the road, everything on the road moved backwards. Many different bamboo fences, thatched huts, small shops, and trees flashed past Ming'er's eyes in the carriage. Only the distant mountains, distant trees, and distant scenery were constantly rotating, as if all these things were placed on a spinning top, making Ming'er a little dizzy. The car continued to move forward, with the surrounding high mountains and low hills forming a circular encirclement around them.</p>
<p>Looking from the right side of the carriage, all that could be seen were the rocky cliffs, only four or five feet away from the car. This highway was entirely built by opening up the mountains. Looking from the left side of the carriage, there was a mountain depression thousands of feet deep, right at the edge of the wheels. If the stones on the road were to loosen and fall, the result would be unimaginable, causing Ming'er to shift his gaze elsewhere, not daring to look at it again.</p>
<p>The car kept flying along the highway, making several turns. Ming'er looked back from the back of the car and saw a narrow highway winding between the vast mountains, winding around a mountain peak and then around a small hill, like a red-chained snake coiling in the mountains. This great project is truly the lifeline necessary for the construction of a new China.</p>
<p>The people in the carriage suddenly stood unsteadily, and everyone unconsciously leaned to the left. Even those who were sitting had a tendency to fall over. Then they heard a burst of car noises, and everyone was worried that something was wrong with the car. Who knew that the speed of the car was too fast, and it had to make a big turn. The driver slammed on the brakes, making Ming'er's heart beat very hard. After making the turn, the mountains gradually receded, and they entered the plains, with continuous fields, crisscrossing paths, adjacent thatched houses, and increasingly frequent traces of people. Breathing suddenly became smoother, but not long after, they were surrounded by layers of mountains again.</p>
<p>"Airplane! Airplane!" Someone in the carriage shouted, instantly silencing the conversation in the carriage.</p>
<p>"Where? I didn't hear any sound! Is it silvery white?" Someone asked. The people in the carriage could not stop their feet from leaning forward again, and the sound of the car also became quiet. After a while, the sound of "rumbling..." airplanes stimulated everyone's eardrums.</p>
<p>Widening their eyes, they stretched their heads out of the carriage window and saw six airplanes soaring in the clouds, so small that they looked like six small dragonflies flying in the vast sky. Of course, they couldn't see anything about whether they were silvery white or not, and the sound of the airplanes was somewhat blurred, probably due to the echo in the mountains. These six dragonflies flew from the peak in the west to the mountainside in the east.</p>
<p>"What's so surprising about this? It stopped the car and delayed the trip. Driver, hurry up," said a bold and impatient friend.</p>
<p>"Don't underestimate it," if today is a silvery-white airplane, don't even think about letting us pass, it will definitely come to find us, at least put the machine gun down, their bullets are too annoying." The driver said humorously, as the car drove forward again. As the sun set, Ming'er's car finally reached its destination.</p>
<h3>One Stroke Drawing</h3>
<p>— Made by Zhen Fu</p>
<h3>China's Holy Land (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shou Qing</p>
<p>Confucius is a sage of China. His hometown is Qufu City in southern Shandong. Now there is a Confucius Temple in the city, so it is not an exaggeration to call it "China's Holy Land"?</p>
<p>In Qufu, there are no famous mountains or rivers, but it is precisely because of the scenic spots of the Holy Land that tourists who pass through Shandong often want to visit it.</p>
<p>Several years ago, a few friends and I passed through Xuzhou and took the opportunity to visit Qufu. We took a train from Xuzhou to a small station called "Yaocun" and got off. We hired two small carts and asked the coachmen to push forward from behind. After walking 18 miles for three hours, we saw a row of not very tall city walls, which was Qufu City. After entering the city gate, we got out of the car and walked towards the Confucius Temple. After passing through a small street, we saw a row of very high red walls, with many magnificent temples built inside, occupying almost half of Qufu City; this is the Confucius Temple.</p>
<p>We walked north along the red wall and reached the "Yucui Gate" of the Confucius Temple. After notifying at the door, someone led us in. Inside, there is a large courtyard with many ancient cypresses standing tall. In the center, there is a pavilion-like house, which is said to be the place where Confucius lectured when he was alive, called "Apricot Altar". Next to the Apricot Altar is a small house with a bare tree, which is said to be a cypress tree planted by Confucius himself. Now it has withered and only has a bare tree trunk left.</p>
<p>Walking further north, we saw a magnificent hall with ten white stone dragon-carved pillars in front. In the center of the hall, there is a statue of Confucius, with his hands clasped and sitting facing south. On the west side, there are also ten statues, all of whom are Confucius's disciples "that is, students." It is also said to be called the Dacheng Hall. Behind the hall, there is a sleeping hall, which houses the statue of Confucius's wife.</p>
<h3>In the Animal Realm (15)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Peng Qi would remember reading a book that said that when a person is dying, if he sees a skylark flying into the sky, then his soul will also fly into the sky. Therefore, he felt very uncomfortable and disappointed, knowing that his life would not be saved, and he would rot with those dead dogs and cats in the water. In an instant, Peng Qi thought of all his past sins and had to regret it. However, he usually only knew how to play with animals, and the more cruel he was, the more proud he was. Where did he think about sin or not? He also remembered that one day at school, the principal had given individual instructions to himself and several other students, saying that people should be based on kindness, and that all animals have habits, have feelings, and know pain, so they must not be abused. At that time, he just sat still, didn't say a word, his face was full of contempt and disdain, and watched the teacher walk off the podium. How could he listen to his old man's words and put them in his heart? But now, there are no more opportunities to repent, and it is too late to listen to the teacher's instructions again. Looking to the future, it is just pitch black, where is there still a glimmer of light? So he silently prayed in his shattered heart, praying to heaven to forgive his past and give him "a way to start anew". At this moment, he floated to the surface of the water for the third and last time.</p>
<p>The skylark flew far away and could hardly be seen anymore. But next to Peng Qi's pale face, came a soft, black nose, and a pair of large brown eyes, staring into Peng Qi's eyes. There was no sign of revenge, and there was no friendly expression. It looked like it was holding a serious, earnest, and proud attitude, and it seemed to be doing things seriously. Its soft and emotional mouth, which had been stabbed by Peng Qi before, was now used to hold Peng Qi, holding him very firmly, but without hurting his body. It looked like it didn't use any force, just like holding a water bird, and immediately flapped the front of its changing foot and swam bravely towards the shore. But Peng Qi was, after all, a person, much heavier than a dead cat, so Knox was really exhausted to swim with him. It was easy to swim to the shore, and even dragged him ashore, before dropping Peng Qi on the ground. It also lay down on the side, putting a foot on Peng Qi's body, clearly saying, "I will handle this matter, and no one else needs to interfere."</p>

<h3>Golden Theater Successfully Hires Two Martial Performers: Lan Yuechun and Wu Yanheng</h3>
<p>— Zhi Bai</p>
<p>The Golden Theater's troupe is full of talent and known for its well-roundedness. However, the martial roles have been lacking since Wang Xiaofang left, leaving many feeling something was missing. Recognizing this, the Golden Theater has recently announced the successful hiring of martial performer Lan Yuechun. He will debut at the beginning of next month with Song Dezhu, Yang Baosen, and others. With Yuechun on board, the Golden Theater will be well-equipped to handle martial roles. I cannot help but congratulate the Golden Theater on finding such a talented performer.</p>
<p>Lan Yuechun, also known as Xiao Xier, is a disciple of the martial artist Li Yongli (Li Wanchun's father). He studied under Li Yongli from a young age and trained with Li Wanchun at the Great World entertainment center for a long time. Later, he went to the old capital (Beijing) and joined Yu Zhenting's Binqing Society training class with Li Wanchun. In the class, he and Li Wanchun were both considered outstanding martial performers. They collaborated in plays such as "Two Generals' Heroic Loyalty," with Yuechun playing the supporting role to Li Wanchun's lead, creating a sensation. Although Yuechun was subordinate to Wanchun during their training, his skills were actually no less impressive than Wanchun's. In 1928, when Li Wanchun first decided to go south with Mei Lanfang, they came together. Unexpectedly, they had disagreements and their relationship soured over the years. Their friendship ended due to this. After leaving Wanchun, Yuechun did not return north and wandered around for ten years, feeling frustrated and unsuccessful. Now, accepting the offer from the Golden Theater is a great opportunity for Yuechun, as he has not had a chance to showcase his skills for ten years.</p>
<p>Yuechun's disadvantage is his voice and appearance; his singing and recitations are not great. However, his martial arts skills are solid. His waist and leg work are better than Wanchun's. Because of his appearance, he is more suited to playing characters with painted faces in plays such as "Yanyang Tower," "The Scholar's Seal," and "Reed Catkin Beach," all of which are his specialties. Although Yuechun has lived in Jiangnan for over ten years, fortunately, he has not been influenced by the local theatrical style. His fighting is clean, his movements are agile, and he is neither too slow nor too fast, avoiding the pitfalls of a heavily stylized performance. This is truly commendable. His performance at the Golden Theater will surely allow him to showcase his great skills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with Song Dezhu's decision to come to Shanghai, the Golden Theater, seeing the great popularity of Gao Shenglin, intended to find a suitable figure from the Northern martial arts scene to come with Song. Initially, they planned to hire Sun Yukun (also known as Xiao Zhenting). However, since Yang Xiaolou's death, Sun has proclaimed himself as a successor of the Yang School and has become quite arrogant, demanding a price of eight thousand. The Golden Theater considered this too high and abandoned the idea of hiring Sun, opting instead for Wu Yanheng to come along.</p>
<p>Wu Yanheng is the son of the famous actress Wu Caixia and the nephew of Xun Huisheng. He studied martial arts with Xu Deyi and is quite skilled. Not only does he have a solid foundation in martial arts, but his singing, recitations, acting, and appearance are all commendable. In today's sparse martial arts talent pool, Wu is a rare find. Yanheng once came to Shanghai with Xun Huisheng and has been away from Shanghai for a long time. Wu's skills are no less impressive than Gao Shenglin's. If Gao can become popular in Shanghai, Wu will undoubtedly be well-received.</p>
<h3>Exploration of Yan Jupeng's Singing</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>2.  Unpleasant Amplification of Parts Meant to Draw Applause: Amplifying the singing to solicit applause is originally a "biting" technique, but it requires a good voice, producing sounds that are loud and pleasant, and singing with proper and flavorful tunes, so that applause is sought and obtained. Today, Jupeng is not like this. He is very eager for applause, so he often amplifies. The result of amplification is a dry and broken sound, monotonous and slow tunes. Therefore, the applause he seeks is mixed with laughter (I observe carefully that the applause contains a friendly, supportive nature). The applause and laughter occur simultaneously, which is not as good as the silence of the audience. Old actors from fifty years ago were often displeased when hearing applause, believing it would disrupt their good tunes. Actors from thirty years ago would not intentionally amplify their voice or use tricks to solicit applause. Ordinary actors deliberately soliciting applause is something from the last twenty years, and it's only getting worse, which is also the trend, because the fees are high, and the sense of gain and loss is important. In the past, Yang Sili would use decorative singing to solicit applause, and he would not stop until there was applause. The audience would often shout "Tong" to end it, opening up a strange situation of soliciting applause. I heard that Xiao Dazi would often invite people to watch the play in order to solicit applause, which is also a strange method. Lately, older Beijing opera actors have been "sprinkling blood" (such as shaking their heads) in their performances to solicit applause, but there are still not many who amplify their voices at any time or use slow tunes to intentionally solicit applause. The arrival of applause is valued in its naturalness, when fame truly reflects ability. Why insist on forcing it? As the saying goes, "A forced melon is not sweet." When the melon is ripe, the stem falls off. Why force it? Forcing and insisting are both unnatural. If it's unnatural, there is an element of danger. Why? Because friends are embarrassed not to applaud, and strangers will definitely hate it. Friends in the audience only account for one-tenth. Therefore, it is dangerous. If Jupeng sings in a normal way with the voice he has, his subtleties are still unmatched by others, because his skill is profound. If he forcefully amplifies his voice, it is like turning gold into iron, or ruining jade with flaws. He wants to get applause, but he can't get true applause. Jupeng is wise, doesn't he see this? If he doesn't drastically change this point and return to normality, I fear that if he comes again, there will be unimaginable things. I am not exaggerating, because I have silently observed the atmosphere of the audience, as well as collected the opinions of the music lovers, and come to this conclusion. What I feel is dangerous, and I dare not keep silent. Or someone might say, Jupeng's performances lasted two weeks, and there were no empty seats. The owner of the Golden Theater had a surplus of nearly twenty thousand gold pieces. Doesn't Jupeng have enough appeal? I laugh and say, counting 1,500 people per day, the total number of people in two weeks is only 30,000. Including those who support him and are regular customers, that's about one-tenth. And the new actress Hou Yulan is also popular, which accounts for two or three-tenths. It's weaker than one percent of the total population of Shanghai now. If he still can't sell out, that's really a big problem. Jupeng hasn't been here for eight years, and his early recordings are praised by those who have heard them. The remote causes are various, and there's no need to list them one by one. If you don't examine the reasons for the unchanged popularity of the seats, and say it's the result of uneven "dimensions" and amplified applause, then I can only look up to the sky and hand it over to heaven to know, and rub my eyes to see what happens afterwards. What else can I say! Jupeng's acting has recently been greatly streamlined. There are extremely precise and admirable places, which cannot be achieved without twenty years of effort. There are occasional minor flaws, but they do not hide the great purity. This is a great improvement and worthy of being written about. In the future, it would be better to remove too much. (End)</p>
<h3>Recent Records of Silver Stars (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yin Si</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun Re-Stages "Wang Xifeng's Havoc in Ningguo Mansion": Gu Lanjun recently planned to film the historical drama "Wang Xifeng's Havoc in Ningguo Mansion," working hard in the summer heat. A few days ago, she suddenly suffered from a severe illness and collapsed. Initially, she had alternating chills and fever, which were very intense. According to her sister, Meijun, when the illness was at its worst, she was delirious with a high fever, reaching 102 degrees. The family was extremely anxious and quickly called in both Chinese and Western doctors for intensive treatment. After examination, the Chinese doctor said it was a heat-induced illness, while the Western doctor said it was the flu. Recently, her condition has improved, but the filming work for Xinhua has been delayed for many days. Until the day before yesterday, "Wang Xifeng" was finally able to return to the studio and begin "Making Havoc in Ningguo Mansion."</p>
<p>Tan Ying Suffers as a Leper Woman: Tan Ying's new film, "Leper Woman," which has been filming for two months, is about to be completed. Yesterday, I spoke with her, and she said that the filming of this film was unusually difficult and the work was very hard. The reason is that the face of the leper woman needs to be thickly coated with many ointment-like products, which takes no less than three hours to apply. Moreover, the mouth is sealed into a semi-locked state, which makes eating very difficult. Since filming work usually lasts for nearly ten hours, even if she feels hungry, there is no way to eat. She has to wait until the work is completed. In addition, the director, Xu Weibang, is very meticulous in his work, requiring the actress's facial expressions to be frantic, terrified, and even to the point of unconsciousness in order to be satisfactory. Therefore, she has suffered a lot for this film, and the fatigue is indescribable. Her words are true, and they are also very clever and insightful.</p>
<h3>Dedication to the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"The Sun Never Sets"</p>
<p>"The Sun Never Sets" — This is a boast of the British Empire, bragging that their colonial flags always fly under the sun, as if the sun never sets. In movies, there are also many examples of propaganda for the might of the imperial army, and the most prominent is Kipling's "Gunga Din." In "Dedication to the Motherland," the Randolph family has repeatedly made meritorious contributions to the empire for three hundred years, until the little Van Brook, who did not want to "join the army," also dedicated himself to the motherland with Bessie Layspon!</p>
<p>However, now the situation in Europe (and the world) is like this, and Chamberlain's policy is like this. The British Empire's boast of conquering colored people seems to be just a fascination with skeletons. The playwright of "Dedication to the Motherland" is even more evasive, pushing the culprit of destroying world peace to the warmongering of arms dealers, while ignoring the aggressors who are carrying out the destruction of world peace. Encouraging people to serve the country is worthy of praise, but it is not the boasting of "The Sun Never Sets." It should move from the narrow sense of dedication to the motherland to engaging in a broad anti-aggression movement to achieve true world peace!</p>
<p>Director Roland Lee's handling is not very good either. First, the entire story is supported by heavy dialogue, which leads to a dull atmosphere. Second, the scene divisions are not compact enough, so the entire script becomes three separate segments. As for individual scenes, the scene when little Van Brook is at the door with his family is quick and concise. The air on the rainy night during Helen's pregnancy, when little Van Brook falsely claims that headquarters ordered Bessie Ricephone to return, and the emotional turmoil of each person, as well as the brothers' big argument and little Van Brook's farewell to his brother and sister-in-law, are quite moving. After the plane bombing, the close-ups of Leon Adderley and others who died in the radio station are very strong and powerful.</p>
<p>Among the actors, little Van Brook is very good at grasping the personality changes in the three different periods. Bessie Ricephone, Leon Adderly, and actresses Virginia Fair and Barbara O'Neill are all mediocre.</p>
<p>Random Notes from an Artist</p>
<h3>Ms. Yin Xing Gu Meijun Talks About: Fragments of Memories (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Leng Fang recorded</p>
<p>During my school days, my given name was Jiao Tianchan. The new name Meijun came about quite ridiculously. Because under the general old concept, some people were still afraid that daughters learning to sing opera and make movies was not very good, so when I went to sign up for the Star Opera Company, I walked on the road while thinking: "My birthday is in December, which is a season of plum blossoms, so I will decide to change my name to Meijun." I didn't expect that the two words Meijun, which came to mind immediately, would become my stage name for life.</p>
<p>Singing Beijing opera was the thing I was most interested in in my early years. I have performed more than a dozen roles as a female lead, such as "Fenhe Bay," "The Little Shepherd Boy," "Meilong Town," "The Festive Phoenix," and "Fighting Puguan." Although I mostly dared to do it without seeking a deep understanding, I may not have been able to perform well in all of them, but I learned quickly in terms of singing, gestures, and stage movements, and I never saw myself as weaker than others. When I later filmed movies, I not only felt the same excitement, but I also did not want to belittle myself. I thought that just like learning Beijing opera, as long as I focused my attention, it would not be difficult to achieve greater success. Unexpectedly, this filming work seemed easy but was actually difficult, especially difficult to master. To this day, although I have filmed many movies, in fact, it is far from my ideal. In my opinion, I am very disappointed that there is not a single work that is more commendable.</p>
<p>Now, I often think to myself: I am really one who is "smart when young." My screen performance in the past few years has simply not improved much. I feel very ashamed, and the reaction of this ashamed mentality is to further strengthen my determination to work hard and fight. Really, when I think of the direction I asked for myself in my early years, it is too far off. I have to quickly and urgently intensify my efforts under the impetus of the shame in my heart.</p>
