<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本迭開五相會議的檢討</h3>
<p>前幾天，日本平沼內閣一再召開五相會議，由平沼首相，板垣陸相，米內海相，石渡藏相和有田外相出席，交換對於最近中國和歐洲的情勢的意見。日本的五相會議在憲法上雖沒有甚麼規定，但近年以來，內閣施政，遇有不易解決的困難問題，就動輒召開五相會議，先行交換意見，然後再提出於閣議。所以五相會議的召集，無異是日本內閣施政碰壁的反映。現在平沼內閣一再召開這種會議，當然是對於目前的境遇，又感到困難，而不得不討論應付的辦法了。</p>
<p>目前日本的對華軍事行動，依照板垣等的意見，北要佔領蘭州，南要佔領昆明。這樣可以控制中國西北西南的兩大國際路綫，阻止外國軍火輸華，而迫中國屈膝，結束戰事。可是她在華的兵力，不但不足以負此重任，連要鞏固所謂佔領區域，也很勉强。所以她要實現這個計劃，非再由國內增援不可；然而國內已無兵可調，於是計劃遂莫由實現，而戰爭的結束，也遂遙遙無期了。此外，一般國民則因不堪負荷這日益擴大的戰費，而厭惡戰爭，甚至演變爲普遍廣大的反戰運動。這種情形，平沼內閣見了，自然要感到煩悶的。</p>
<p>其次，日本的侵華戰爭，引起了她的經濟恐慌。她原來是個先天不足的帝國主義者。她雖被稱爲新興的工業國，但所有的僅是輕工業，重工業是根本說不上有基礎的。而且可憐得很，不論重工業和輕工業的原料，都要仰給於外國，所以在平時已是一個入超的國家。自侵華戰爭爆發以來，大量軍需品，源源輸入，入超益增，現金外流，亦隨之增加，至國內存金缺乏，準備不足，日圓的對外匯率，因此漸漸低落，而輸入的原料和軍需品的價格却和這成反比例地騰貴起來。同時戰費的一再增加，又造成了龐大的赤字恐慌、。她為挽救這種恐慌起見，遂運用了濫發公債，隨意增稅和强迫儲蓄等辦法。想盡方法來增加人民的負擔，而事實上還是杯水車薪，無濟於事。於是她又在考慮運用日圓貶値和濫發紙幣的方法了，前者從表面上看來，果可使她的製造品價格低落，在國外市塲易於消售，藉以挽救入超的危機，但一切輸入的原料和軍用品的價格，却要因此騰貴，結果恐怕還是得不償失。至濫發紙幣則更爲危險，因爲濫發紙幣的結果，會使物價加速騰貴，貨幣的安定性，也隨之失掉。</p>
<p>至於歐洲的情勢，自德國併呑捷克以後，民治陣綫的態度，漸趨積極，已在組織聯合陣綫，阻止德國的侵略。這種局勢的發展，自然不利於日本，因爲德國一被包圍，對於她的侵略政策的行使，至少要少一個帮兇，這是她很躭心的事情。她近來竭力要辯明和德義並沒有甚麼了不起的關係，而最近竟又放出了「天皇親政」的烟幕，希圖改變英法美等國對她的觀感，使於她日益不利的國際環境，漸漸變爲有利。同時，她又看到在東亞大陸，和英國的利害對立難以調和，於是便對美特別表示好感，想進而拆散英美在遠東的合作，以遂其獨覇東亞的野心。</p>
<p>上述各方面的情形的發展，都使日本的侵略政策，無往而不碰壁。五相會議的召集，就是想討論出一個辦法來克服上述的困難的。可是日本軍閥雖有把整個國運作孤注一擲的勇氣，却沒有方法和緩國內民衆的反戰情緒，更沒有變更經濟鐵則的魔力，而包着糖衣的外交辭令也遮不住企圖獨覇遠東的猙獰面目。所以這種會議，結果不過是空具形骸罷了。</p>

<h3>西康甘孜　大金寺懸案解決　已簽定解決辦法七條</h3>
<p>康定通訊、歷久未決之大金寺懸案、去年杪經前西康建省委員會所派調解甘案專員章鎮中、西藏噶厦特派代表代本汪欽、會同康臧交涉坐辦范昌元、甘孜各代表及鄧柯阿都同大金寺代表等、在德格更慶、迭次開會討論、中間經過四十餘日、最後協商議定安置良善大金僧規約詳細</p>

<p>遂告解決　查大金寺在甘孜縣屬之絨壩岔構造輝煌、寺僧近二千、屬黃教、有大喇嘛七人、重要事務、須由七大喇嘛議決、方可施行、其中推出最負有重望之坐壇大喇嘛爲阿都佛都督、總理全寺內外一切事宜、有指揮全寺大小喇嘛之權、大金寺廟產甚豐、常年派有管家喇嘛、在康藏各大市塲、經營皮毛藥材等業、且放款與蠻冢商人、經營生意、其富足冠於全康各寺、聞其</p>
<p>所窖金銀　可供全康駐軍十年薪餉之用、此慘案之發生、最初由於百里土司鄧德金因食糧之被搶、投至大金寺申訴、大金寺僧遷怒甘孜商人、雙方發生衝突、嗣藏方亦派隊加入、並發給寺僧槍彈、以致事態擴大、釀成流血慘劇、數年未決、大金僧衆固守流離之苦、甘方商人、時有裹足之虞、即介於兩者之間之德格及沿金沙江各縣、亦感受連帶影響、</p>
<p>數年懸案　旣經康藏兩方負責官長及各代表開誠佈公、圓滿解決、以後甘金人士、或可捐棄舊嫌、增進感情、大金寺駐鑪管家喇嘛（康語稱爲大西巴）羅將策、日前特普謁劉主席致敬、對政府解決大金懸案、俾全寺僧衆免於流離失所、極表感謝、並表示今後決用戶劉主席建設新西康、記者以羅雖非大金寺阿都佛都督之正式代表、然以一管家喇嘛、對當局能</p>

<p>開始談話　由席通司繙譯、記者詢以何時至鑪、答、去年七月間來此、已有六個多月、談話時、頻以之家按鼻菸於鼻孔吸之、聞喇嘛是否代表大金寺阿都佛都督駐鑪辦事、答、否、余是管家喇嘛、在此經商、並非代表、大金寺懸案旣和平解決、寺中有權力者、不久派正式代表來此、向劉主席致敬、並報告經過、寺中前爲感謝政府解決懸案、曾着人送來</p>
<p>豹皮一襲　囑余謹獻與劉主席、余之日前晋謁主席、即爲此而致敬、此時隔壁鼓鐃聲益厲、言語幾不可辦、問大金寺慘案發生眞正原因何在、答、實爲一百里土司、以致與甘方發生誤會而起衝突、馴至擴大、言至此、以手指盤、請記者喫糖、余謙遜謝之、問大金寺僧衆與甘方衝突傷亡及損失如何、答、僧衆傷亡二百餘人、寺中財物損失、約值銀一萬平、問貴寺有喇嘛若干人、答、有事時刻召集一千九百餘人、平時實無此數、問喇嘛對於此案解決有何感想、答、此案旣經雙方訂立協定順利解決、俾免敝寺僧衆流離、余對康省府極爲感謝、旋即告辭而別、</p>

<h3>閩省糧食亟待調節　省府籌設管理局</h3>
<p>福州泉州米價高漲</p>
<p>閩東閩北穀賤傷農</p>
<p>福州通訊、閩省糧食月來日趨昂貴、福州每担漲至十六元、泉州每担漲至十八元、實爲從來未有現象、其原因爲閩東閩北產米區域運輸困難、閩東之米、向由海道輸出、近因日艦封鎖、改由陸路運輸、運費旣增重、時間又遲緩、閩北之米、則由閩江運下、近因天旱水淺、船隻難行、到者甚少、故閩東北產地民間存米甚多、每担僅值五六元、與福州泉州相差三倍左右、對於</p>
<p>農村經濟　流通、殊有影響、江西省政府因去年秋收甚豐、餘量極鉅、月前特派員來閩磋商、將贛米換取本省糖鹽兩物、閩省府當定購十六包、但至今尚未運到、近勝負爲調解戰時民食起見、特在福州設立全省糧食管理局、專負流通各縣糧食、均衡價格之責、採取官督商辦、官商合作政策、一方關顧商家血本、一方注重民生、對於運輸捐稅評價給照各事、均力求減輕便利、已召集各幫米商代表談話一次、商定具體辦法、以便着手進行、至目下</p>
<p>治標方法　、對泉州方面已由省政府撥款五萬元、交地方紳商、組織平糶、對福州方面、則將閩北某項囤米、先運一批來售、十五十六兩日、已陸續運到一萬六千包、一二日內米價當可降落、故本省糧食問題、並不如外間所傳之嚴重、惟沿海區域如莆田縣之平海莆禧兩區、福清縣之高山龍田兩區、去夏均因旱災歉收、人民又因戰事影響、不能出海捕魚、多告絕糧、近由省振濟會撥款一百萬元施賑、並擬將一部份漁民、往內地開墾、又粵省潮汕兩屬、近因來源缺乏、米價高漲、以閩邊漳浦雲霄各縣、存量尚富、特請准予</p>
<p>運粵接濟　、當局尚在考慮中、至本省去年夏季作物收穫數量、約在十足年七成以上、此外關於日用之生油豆油菜油、向來自華北天津青島烟台大連營口各埠、去秋起因日方統制油類出口、來貨銳減、價格飛漲、省農業改進處、乃於本街冬耕時、提倡栽種花生大豆油菜、以爲製油原料、成效甚佳、現該處已由江西購到新式製油機、在閩北設廠製造、以求自給、所餘渣滓、並可作肥料、實爲一舉兩得、</p>

<p>泰縣通訊、華軍反攻淮安部隊、十七日抵達指定地點、同時右翼第某軍、進抵淮安城郊、與友軍取得聯絡、經積極反攻後、節節勝利、據此間交通界消息、淮安確於十八日晨爲華軍收復、華軍某部於前夜十二時許、向邵伯日軍突襲、日軍驚惶失措、乃開砲示威、並用機艙無目標亂射、至天明時、華軍以任務已達、安然返回原防、日軍損失彈藥甚鉅、</p>
<p>興化通訊、十五日下午三時許有日重轟炸機三架、由海邊飛往鹽城、盤旋數週、投彈六枚、均落北郊外、並無甚損失、隨又往興飛行模樣、本邑防空機關、聞有機聲、發出警報、結果未經縣城、改往東台而去、</p>
<h3>淪陷後之常熟　華軍活躍</h3>
<p>始終控制西北鄉</p>

<p>淪陷以後　最初流動於西北鄉之遊擊隊伍、有忠義救國軍第五六十等三支隊、在去夏爲遊擊隊最活躍時期、在此時期、在此地域、漢奸直無立足之餘地、雖由僞組織委有僞第四第七兩區區長、但均未能推行僞組織之政令、第四區區長錢綬臣且以協助遊擊隊而被日軍捕獲槍決、繼此之後、僞組織方面、復委屈煥如爲僞第四區區長、屈因畏懼遊擊隊、設僞第四區事務所於港口鎮、未敢明目張胆、因之僞組織之對於西北鄉一切行政、始終擱置、當時日軍亦因前方戰局緊張、無暇顧及、</p>
<p>迭次接觸　迨武漢失守、常熟日僞方面、始着手消滅常熟縣境內各地遊擊隊並決定對東鄉「撫」西鄉「剿」中堅曾在澄虞交界地處、接觸數次、日僞均未獲十分勝利、至去年十月間、蘇省府爲整頓淪陷區域行政起見、復委任蔡潤祺爲常熟縣縣長、蔡氏係一青年軍人、精明幹練、於奉委後、即率所部第三戰區江南挺進軍獨立第二支隊將士一千五百人左右、開抵常熟縣境之沙州市、設縣府行署、推動行政、委任各區區長、青天白日旗幟、又光明的飄揚於西北鄉各地、同時、日僞方面、則益感不安、乃以二星期之計劃、決定周密之大大包圍策略、調吳縣無錫江陰之日軍、配以相當數量之僞軍、絡繹開西北鄉、進駐第四區之鹿苑鎮、忠義救國軍爲避免包圍、乃相率退至澄錫境內、縣府亦即遷離沙洲市境、</p>
<p>傀儡斂跡　在此一幕中、爲僞方奔走最力者、厥唯屈煥如與王道化輩、日軍進駐鹿苑鎮後、即逼該鎮人錢顯夫任僞鹿苑鎮董、一面邀錢昌時出面任事、在日軍未佔鹿苑前、錢本任忠義救國軍第六支隊第三大隊長之職、日軍抵鎮、曾一度走避、終以利慾薰心、且聞日僞相招、竟往充僞第四區自衛團長、至其所屬部隊、本僅一中隊、至此亦及全部交於日軍貼騐、詎未數日、突有西塘橋人龐筠者、本係一遊擊隊長、隸於楊行方部、龐之爲人、勇敢無匹、聞錢昌時之行爲、憤怒異常、遂於上月二日、潛抵西塘橋、探明錢部駐地、此日傍晚、龐雙手執盒槍、率裝飾三人、疾馳秦家宕、錢昌時一時措手不及、當塲被繳下輕機關槍二挺、步槍九枝、經此一役後、漢奸始稍斂跡、</p>
<p>華軍活躍　去年退駐於江陰楊舍附近之忠義救國軍第五六兩支隊、雖暫時退出、然時刻積極活動、三日曾有第五支隊一隊士潛至東來鎮、以盒槍擊斃一日兵、奪該日兵手中之槍而逸、嗣復全部出動、經欄杆橋等處、而開抵恬莊·廟橋·西塘橋之中間犄角而駐、人數約達一千二百餘人、小鋼砲·輕重機槍齊全、此項隊伍、旣逼近鹿苑、駐鹿苑、之日軍遂大起恐慌、急向城內乞援、五六支隊全部開恬莊·西徐市間之河陽山前、準備廝殺、同時城內之日軍與北漍鹿苑之日軍、亦步步向河陽山緊迫、一時機槍聲密如聯珠、忠義救國軍奮勇前衝、斃日軍十餘名、激戰一小時許、槍砲聲始漸稀、而遊擊隊以任務已達、即行整隊撤退、日軍於重創之後、未敢追趕、原駐鹿苑之日軍、全部秘密移駐西塘橋、防再遭遊擊隊襲擊、最近日軍駐在常熟西北鄉各地者、計有鹿苑、東來鎮·鴨和橋·十一圩港·北漍等處、且裝置電話綫、均已完竣、</p>

<h3>湘軍陶廣部　星夜馳防富春江　勁旅五師開抵指定地點　臨山被轟錢江南岸肅清</h3>
<p>關於浙東戰事、本埠浙商、極爲關懷、茲據杭州通訊稱、此間日軍一千餘人、及新由上海等處調來之日兵二千左右、於二十一日下午起、絡續調往富陽等處、且命僞組織製造之大小汽艇一百二十餘艘、亦由日方運往沿江一帶、茲據確息、調往富陽之日軍、於此日拂曉、分乘汽艇二十餘艘、偷渡富春江、在×××地方登陸、華軍劉建緒部、即以猛烈砲火襲擊、雙方遂展開激烈戰、達三小時之久、後華軍佯敗、日軍遂乘勝深入、以致×××地暫時失陷、旋經華方某長官在日後路配備完竣後、即以大包圍勢、予以痛擊、是時日方知已中計、故幾度企圖奪圍而逃、但已終不可能、其進犯鎭海之日兵艦、現仍雲集口外、並間續向華方要塞砲轟、但漫無目標、彈均落荒郊、故華方陣地、毫無受損、至進犯錢江南岸之日軍、乃係二十日晨在烟幕彈掩護下、一部分用汽艇偷渡、大半係由錢江大橋架設木板而過、沿江華軍聞訊、即集中火力猛轟、斃日三百餘名、並燬去橋樑一部分、其他由汽艇迂迴偷渡之日軍、得在飛機砲火下圖強行登陸、華軍即利用優越地勢、與日展開血戰、並幾度短兵相接、終囚戰略關係、陣地稍向後移、此日華軍前後兩路反攻、並籍山地向下痛擊、現六和塔等地已展開激戰、市區內可聞清晰槍砲聲、故一般順民漢奸、莫不恐慌、又悉浙東華軍、已雲集各要隘、待命殲日、且各防區內適齡壯丁、已於日前完成武裝、自動向當局請纓、哲保鄉土、故料此次日方進犯浙東、企圖打通浙贛鐵路、截斷浙西等地華軍後路、決難得逞、</p>

<h3>松門洋面航空母艦</h3>
<p>浙東沿海各縣、日來時遭日機日艦肆擾、華軍防務鞏固、始終未能得逞、溫州之松門洋面、於二十一日午刻、到日航空母艦一艘、似有窺伺浙東企圖、華軍當局已予嚴密監視、但日艦行踪飄忽、隨時移動、其目的全在紛亂華軍視覺、擾亂後方、</p>
<h3>華陸空軍隨時出動</h3>
<p>又悉、日軍進窺浙東、我方早有準備、現悉駐守各地軍隊、人數約在百萬左右、防禦極爲鞏固、第三戰區司令長官顧祝同之機械化部隊、及流動砲隊均馳赴某地待命、浙主席黃紹雄、則在某地坐鎭、同時中央方面除派勁旅佈防外、並調空軍一大堆、開至浙西某處、準備隨時出動應戰、掃蕩日軍、</p>

<h3>甬溫幫客恢復辦貨</h3>
<p>自浙東形勢趨緊後、本市出口商業、亦隨受劇烈變動、因戰後各路運輸困難、且多成爲淪陷區、商貨銷路、均大減削、惟浙東方面寗波溫州等埠、客貨往來、反呈活躍、近以日艦連續砲擊浙東沿海重鎭、本埠各商貨多有街道甬溫方面客商來電停止採辦貨物、一時市塲人心、頗形不安、茲悉自昨日起、甬溫二幫、已恢復辦貨、故由滬開往該二埠船隻、客商托運貨物、極爲踴躍</p>

<h3>西區情況日劣　西人出而主張</h3>
<p>西區聯合會首次集會</p>
<p>討論警務衛生等問題</p>
<p>大陸報云、西人組織之西區（公共租界外）聯合會、昨（二十三日）晚舉行第一屆年會、總委員會主席即席致辭、　舉各點、如滬西住宅區情況之每況愈下、賭窟興盛、各種罪惡叢生、該區居民怨聲嘖嘖、無法補救、會間一致通過報告、核准動議案、謂該會對該區居民所遇之問題、以甚驚心之態度視之、並請委員會考慮在行將舉行之納稅人會議中提出處理下列事件之決議案、（一）充量之警務問題、（二）衛生·火災預防·與其他公共康健·與公共工程事件、（三）有效的管理工廠、（四）凡工部局委任之任何委員會與其他當局磋商、並辦理談話、以保滬西界外區施以適當管理者、西區聯合會代表得參與其事、</p>
<p>西區無人管理　主席在席間致詞解釋云、吾人居於較少之區域中、包含上海在內、有形式不同之管理機關、不下四種、事實上有五種、惟目前不准外僑居住之各處、暫可不予顧及、公共租界係由居住或設辦公處於其界內之納稅人推舉之工部局所管理、法租界由其領事管理、此外之其他區域、以及鐵路綫迤西之區域（虹橋）、今名義上在日方管理之下、自公共租界西部邊界至鐵路、及自洛克希爾路（譯音）至蘇州河、目前爲一種任何人共有之地區、雖亦在外國駐軍之防區內、但該區中缺少任何集中之管理、亦無任何確切之管理機關、其最惡劣者、厥爲該區中不發一言、雖向工部局納稅、但無選舉權、亦無補救現有弊害之方法、更無團體向收稅者發表其意見、但收稅者茍在技術上不管理該區、但當然應確切負責、　　其爲康健而法律永有的可居住之區域、</p>
<p>一切每況愈下　要知西區界外馬路區域之一般情況、迅趨煤礦愈下、一二年前、該區或爲上海中上階級中外人士最喜居住區域之一、租界馬路間之少數鄉村、秩序井然、今則各種方式之無法紀與無秩序、該區中幾全具之矣、道路上交通擁擠、此等道路原不堪重荷、致陷頹壞狀況、路側與人行道上、爲小販與食品攤所阻礙、且大半被利用之爲工作地或市塲、小商人與貧民到處活動、大批工廠已落成、雖工廠或不致確實危害康健、但最爲居民所反對、且發出甚令人不快之嗅味、沿凱旋路之焙烘藺子、即其一例、大批不堅固與不衛生之建築物、亦已築成、此種房屋、具有火災危險、固絕無疑慮、該區全境之火險保險費、已增加百分之五十、水量供給、不足應付大火、水之消耗、雖已大增、但給水管並未同時增加、一般應用之水量供給、實感不足、</p>
<p>各種罪惡橫行　今西區賭窟興盛、各種罪惡、公然橫行、而山界外不受工部局管理之人、予以鼓勵、界外馬路間各區內之不衛生情況、與過分擁擠、其結果大有傳染病蔓延之虞、工部局衛生處對改善情況、頗多盡力、但資源不足、且無權採行眞正需要之嚴峻辦法、聯合會會員熟知此等情況、亦明瞭工部局所遇之困難、蓋局方須仗領事團與軍事當局之積極協助也、委員會於遏制弊害、甚至進而防杜令人不快之工廠與住戶、頗多成就、欲獲成果、必須時加觀察、立取行動、會方茲請會員誠摯合作、將不良狀況、通告會方、庶能與事主或有關當局進行交涉、</p>
<h3>日方今日開放青島　甘言動人觀聽</h3>
<p>謂將秉此原則開放長江</p>
<p>但何時開放猶遙遙無期</p>
<p>大陸報云、日大使館發言人昨（二十三日）在招待記者席上宣稱、日當局准許自本月二十五日起、各外國船隻可沿青海外港各碼頭停泊、是項消息、已由駐青島日總領事發出、並公佈文告云、青島重行開放、希望第三國明瞭日政府之眞意、而合作樹立日政府今致力從事之東亞新秩序云云、發言人又稱、然一貫青島日總領事所表示之精神、而</p>
<p>重行開放　揚子江、乃屬另一問題、發言人答覆詢問云、揚子江乃因軍事需要之故、而加以封鎖、此乃衆所熟知者、惟終將重行開放、以供外商航運、至於開放日期、今未能確舉之、發言人繼續陳述重行開放青島外港、以停泊便利給予外國船隻出入、而引述青島日總領事之文告云、自軍興以還、日政府已擴展便利、俾供第三國和平從事</p>
<p>商業活動　雖其結果、已對日方之軍事行動有嚴重之不利、此乃「衆所週知之事實」、爲一貫是項政策起見、乃重行開放青島外港、以供外國商輪出入、有謂封閉外港、不准商輪出入、乃屬歧視舉動、或爲封閉「開放門戶」、殊屬遺憾、蓋此等限制、純出軍事需要、絕無侵犯第三國商業權利或干涉和平商業之意、故青島</p>
<p>日總領事　希望第三國因青島重行開放而明瞭日政府之眞意、協助樹立東亞新秩序云、各記者乃就上述文告中表示日政府意向之各點、齊向發言人詰問、某記者詢、鑒於華北樹立新經濟限制後、始實行重行開放青島、在此等情勢之下、開放之舉、果有甚大之價值乎、發言人答、此可在青島總領事所發文告中覓得答覆、有詢發言人可一貫青島總領事表示之情感、而說明揚子江能重行開放乎、</p>
<p>發言人答　揚子江因軍事需要之封鎖、此君所熟知者也、某記者詢、此語即日當局擔任揚子江卒將重行開放之謂乎、發言人答、然、揚子江將開放之、惟吾人不能說明何日開放、某記者詢、青島文告中切實聲明日政府希望滿足第三國之希望、則對於重行開放揚子江問題、亦將應用同一原則乎、發言人答、已解除限制之各區、均應用同等之精神云、關於文告發表後、在青島將供給</p>
<p>外國商輪　之便利事、昨晚本埠日當局未能供給詳報、惟昨晚向負責方面探悉、外輪將可泊於第一號碼頭之第四綫、故是項讓步、對外國航運公司、必頗關重要、又聞如日方任何時間認軍事局勢有封鎖各碼頭之需要、則將不予通知、即加封鎖、且夜間不准航行、至一部份重行開放青島港口之條規全文、日總領事已通知該地、各外國領署當局矣、</p>

<h3>小學教員　謝祥生兩案併發　誘姦女性侵占保證金　一已審結一在上訴中</h3>
<p>常州人謝祥生、今年三十九歲、前在法租界喇格納路法工部局設立之喇格納小學內充級任教員、於廿六年四月初登報招請女性助教、時有瀏河人王吳氏之女王潔、時年二十歲、而實足年齡祗十八歲四個月、風姿娟秀、已在鄉間高校畢業、欲求深造、迫於家境、無力轉學、乃來滬寓居西門路永裕里九號姑母家、欲謀一半工半讀機會、以求深造、遇見報載</p>
<p>招請女性</p>
<p>助教之廣告、即去函應徵、越日、王潔接得丁捷臣具名之來信、囑王往蒲柏路吉益里十四號、與謝會晤接洽、當予合格錄用、議定每月薪水十五元、即令王在吉益里十四號謝之寓所辦事、專門批閱小學生之文卷、王於四月廿六日前去、正式任事、謝王兩人每日</p>
<p>相處漸熟</p>
<p>至五月十六日下去四時、謝由學校回寓、竟用強暴手段、將王潔姦污、後謝聲言、雙親已離去、許以正式結婚等甘言哄騙、女即住於謝處、又繼續姦淫十餘次、至是經過約三四月、女因被蹂躪身體、患病不起、詎謝竟一反猙獰面目、下逐客之令、將女揮之門外、王女至是、始知受愚失身、無力與謝交涉、乃由女母王氏吳氏以法定代理人資格、</p>
<p>女王潔</p>
<p>同延錢源律師代理、具狀特二法院刑庭、對謝祥生提起妨害風化及家庭自訴、并附帶民訴、要求追償慰藉金贍養費等八千元，而被告謝祥生亦提起反訴誣告之訴，初審結果、判決謝祥生王吳氏均無罪，王潔自訴部分不受理、附带民訴駁回、自訴人王吳氏王潔母女不服、向高三分院提起上訴、</p>
<p>因被告謝祥生於此事發生後、攸關</p>
<p>學校名譽</p>
<p>由校方將其斥退、致住址　移、無從傳達、致上訴宣告停止審判、案遂懸擱、乃謝祥生於前年戰事發生後、利用非常時期機會、於上年在公共租界圓明園路一三二號青年協會樓上、設立任事介紹所、其內幕以介紹婚姻為主、因轉世騙取僱員及登記人之保證金化用、會被公共捕房查知、派探前往搜查檢舉、將謝逮解特一法院、</p>
<p>審理結果</p>
<p>因謝無充份犯罪證據、諭知無罪釋放、詎謝不改前非、一仍舊貫進行、嗣山被害人搜集證據、向特一法院告發、經馮世德推事審訊結果、判決謝祥生業務上侵佔罪、處有期徒刑一年、收押候對、謝不服判、決向高二分院提起上訴、现在偵查期間、定於下月三日再訊在案、兹因前案業經高三分院查悉、備文於日前派　向高二分院将謝</p>
<p>移提到案</p>
<p>定昨日午後三時開庭審理、乃上诉人王潔已於戰事發生後投八路軍政治部任事、王母吳氏、亦已返回鄉間、無從傅到、故昨日午後、山吳廷琪庭長偕王钺陳大器两推事開合議庭審理、上訴人方面的代理律師錢源代到、聲述上訴理由後、訊之謝祥生，滔滔道辯、承認與王女發生關係·事出雨願·并無用強暴威脅與誘惑之事、後因女方向我索三百元，無力應付、致發生訟事等語、庭上核供，宜告辯論終結、定卅一日宣判、謝仍還押、</p>

<p>自由談所謂「共同宣言」  茂烈　　自從德國消滅捷克，向羅馬尼亞提出要求之後，英國政府的態賭似乎大大地改變了一下，居然會與以不承認。雖然這一個不承認不能給希特勒有什麼影響，却也不能說不是差强人意的舉動。此後，英國政府便急向蘇聯和法國，提出「共同宣言」這一件事。這當然又是差强人意的舉動，因為比了默爾而息，一無作為，總要好些。然而這「共同宣言」，如果各國簽字成立，發表出來，究竟有多少效力呢？國際間有多少條約，已經被强者所所撕毁，而這些條約，還都是强者會經親自簽字過的，那１現在一方面的宣言，强暴者看見了，還有什麼顧忌呢？米美國的被併吞，正在這宣言的醞釀時期，也就可以給我們作深思了。　　因此這些所謂「共同宣言」，强暴者既不加入，就已成成為「片面宣言_」，而波蘭與荷蘭的不加入，更使這「片面」之上，也發生着裂痕，假使這宣言終於會成立的活，那末當然就耍成為「零碎宣言」了。真正共同宣言，就是國際間的條約，無效，乃求之於片面宣言，就是美其名的所謂共同宣言；片面宣言不能如意成立，乃求之於零碎宣言，就是現在英國政府所在进行的宣言：每况愈下，一蟹不如一蟹，其有不為强暴者所匿笑，所揄者，我簡直有些不相信！　　我不是强暴者，當然對於這種宣言，無論其為零碎的，片面的或共同的，都沒有匿笑或揶揄的意思在內。我這樣說，不過要指出這兩點：對付强暴者，任何文件都是沒有用的，而此項「共同宣言」，其實「零碎宣言」，更其沒有用；對付强暴者，就只有用實際行動，來與以嚴重的打擊！否則，我不能不疑惑：英國政府還是在敷衍一般被侵略的弱小：在强暴者沒有侵犯到英國本身之前，英國政府總不肯出以更積極的實際行動。　　所謂實際行動，也並不一定藥動員出兵——如果這樣，當然最好，儘有其他工作可做，例如組成防禦陣綫等，做了之後，一樣可以遏制侵略者的兇　。奈英國政府見不及此，或者見及此而不願如此做，只想以宜言了事，那末，要想世界和平，真正是緣木求魚了！春初夜曲  LK　　推開心之扉門，生命底弦上彈過二十個寒暑。　　美國掛懷和依戀，心情像夏夜的螢火，閃落河堤，橋　，閃過　林，也閃過靜靜的田野。　　是原野生物的夜奏，抑揚一片。　　「想不起飛去」？心底問曲，彈起螢火閃爍。　　一年，二年，三年……是青春的活力，推向生命底征途。　　不懂嫵媚，不懂欺騙。心地白紙般潔淨，讓曉風吹起像海燕樣翅翔，鷹　般遠飛。縱然那2是鍍金的破銅爛鐵，也得嘗試；縱然那2是殘酷的混世魔王，也得嘗試；縱然那2是毒幕？的樂園！也得嘗試。　　是嘗試的共鳴，招引來同志的呼號。呼號像夏季的蚊吼，漸漸地，漸漸地高漲，一陣雷吼電閃。　　是醜惡得詛咒，是美麗也得頌讚；是蟄伏得推動，是狂放也得約束；是欺騙的戳穿，是毒計也要解開；是在榨得反抗，是抽血也要搏　。　　蟄伏的挺起了，馴順的倔强了，奴隸的心，隨着流水東去。同情把精神匯集在一起。　　「想不起想衝了」？　眾底心曲，彈起春雷洪流。　　一年，二年，三年，……是青春的活力，推向生命底征途。　　爬着峻嶺，跋涉原野，二十年，生命的弦上彈起懷戀的哀歌，然而還有熱，有血，有摯愛，也有追求。　　創傷的血，受難的血，一滴，一堆；太陽溫摩着，曉風吹拂着，巨輪碾過，血滋長着大地！　　然而這是鋪眾時代道路的礡石。年青的一代跨向前去。　　二十年，像蝸牛樣爬過。　　二十年，像海洋樣飛過。　　夜奏激成共鳴，嘗試激成　爭，我心頭該有暢快的歡笑，跳躍着祝頌自己。　　螢火閃爍吧！明亮。春雷怒吼吧！力量。　　　眾的心，引導着我；我的心，依附着華眾。縱然前面還有荊棘，毒丸，還有那無邊的醜惡黑夜裏的　動。　　「想不想飛去」？心底間曲，掩在扉門背後。　　二十年，悠長的時間；二十年，短促的過程。　　這裏依然有血，有熱，有摯愛，也有追求。　　「儘帶着奮　的心來！有戰神，但也有愛神」！　　子夜，心之扉門關閉，生命之弦上彈起輕快的行進曲。枕頭  鶴鳴　　枕頭上繡着一幅中國地圖，並且在東北角上，又加上一個紅色問號」，這是她在二年前繡好送給我的。　　它每夜伴我入睡，由黑暗到光明。　　紅色「_問號」，我每天見着它，它嚴告我：中國已有了獰惡的豺狼，它警惕我．不要再醉生萝死！它更督促我：做我所要做的事，而且是應該的！　　　一股血腥的氣味，從紅色的綫條裏刺入我的鼻尖，由鼻尖直入心坎的深處。　　　這裏面臥着無數腐朽了的死，充溢着一片鮮紅的血流，瀰漫着烽火的濃烟。　　這紅色的綫條，不是她繡上的，是鬼子的暴　和野蠻所織成！　　　二年前，是在二年前，她繡好了送給我。二年，僅此二年短促的時日，這枕頭上却又添上了　　幾個「問號」一個，兩個，三個。　　我要哭。哭。懦弱的表現！笑麼？我並沒有發過一絲一毫的國難財，我又不是出賣祖宗的漢奸！　　我想，我應該在抗戰到底的旗幟下，板起面孔，下着堅定的步子，踏過一切腐朽了的死屍和将要腐朽的活屍，走向光明的去處，來爭民族的自由枕頭，我願把它永遠放在我的身邊，為了勉勵我自己，為了記念着她，更為了永遠不要忘記了我們唯一的敵人所給與我們的這無數的問號」！大哥  良弼　　大哥在什麼時候去的，　　我可記不清楚，　　母親問我近日可有信來，　　我祗說個大概——現在長沙！　　偶爾翻開了書箱，　　有一張大哥的照片，　　還是在二年前，　　大哥在今淪陷的南京ｘｘ大學，　　深　中，大哥在匍匐前進，——多神凜，威嚴。　　大哥還在背後寫着「實習紀念」！　　我拿牠在母親膝前說：　　大哥又來一封信——在湖南岳陽，　　你看大哥多快活，——心在笑啦！　　媽媽！你不憂愁，　　大哥不久會斬下許多的鬼頭，　　新年里，大哥回來談個歡笑！　　今天報紙上多大鉛字：　　ｘ營長　烈成仁，　　我知道是我的大哥，　　「大哥啊……」我不是哭——在笑！　　「三弟，四弟...大哥千萬不要怕後頭無繼你的人」。　　母親哭里在笑：「好孩子！」　　爺更在誇耀；「到底是個男兒！」　　大哥安息吧！　　一切都在為你笑！足迷藏  唐榮愷文弱症  人甬　　或許是先天的關係，我自少便文弱多病。又是稚子，太受母親寵愛，更兼跟蛆姐在一所女校念書，我總跟她在一起，跳跑於我就此無緣。雖然在性格上，我還是一般剛毅氣；可是在體力上，我深深地染上了文弱的氣氛，我患着常年的文弱症。　　正因為我有一剛毅性格，自己體力雖然文弱，却反有些大力士的氣派。在學校裏我對於那些被校方寵護的赳赳武夫（學校運動代表），也從不稍微委曲遷就。有了糾紛，我總要據理力爭，從不示弱。又如閱讀舊小說，讀到形容書生的「手無縛雞之力」的老句，我總下意識地顯出輕視的態度，毫不自感文弱。　　近来家裏叫木匠司務裝修，每天餘下不少木塊。有幾塊太大了，老媽子說不能生火，晚上我就借了木匠司務底斧頭，捲起袖子，自己劈柴．我舉起粗長的斧柄，斧頭在燈光下發出光亮；我擺號了馬式」，用力劈着木塊。劈得沒有多久，右臂感到發酸，漸漸地不能支持起來。我便想到白天那位木匠不断地在劈，鋸和敲，始終精神抖擻，不會哼過一聲．我開始省悟，我太文弱了。縛雞雖還能應付，劈柴却難以勝任了。老媽子笑着說：「讀書人到底劈不來呵！」這笑，無疑是取笑。　　而且，接着右手，連拿東西也不勝任了：舉筷子不住發顫；伸手用調羹拿湯，等到拿近口邊，匙中已剩一小半了，我怕人家發覺，更怕老媽子再度見笑，我不敢再喝湯了。啊，我確是個文弱症的患者了。　　是的，白面書生確是百無一用。我幻想着許多偉大的場面，那裏找不到一絲「文弱」的書生氣，拳頭全都像鐵鎚，胳膊像鐵柱那麼地；揮動着毛瑟槍，像燈草一樣的輕便。　　我決不自　，但我們底書生　中，患上了文弱症的委實太普通了。「文質彬彬」，有些人還以此自傲。「混蛋！」我幾乎想罵出口來，罵自己，也罵我周圍的書生　！　　文弱，這實在是與末期肺癆一樣可怕的病症。在今日，我們不允許再讓「弱菌」寄生下去了，我們有藥方——鍛煉——要立愈這項絕症！我們底「決心」是華佗，我們底「恒心」是聖藥，一天，一天，總有一天殺盡那毒勝癆菌的「弱菌」，醫愈了這最可恥的文弱症！　　黎明，晨曦爬進房來，我猛想到我底「文弱症」還沒有斷　，我不能苟安在床上，起來，我便一躍起身了。　　戰鼓在響了，文弱症應早日痊愈才行！我底師兄師弟們，你說是不是？中篇小說烽火中  周燕　　他在楓林鎮上忙忙碌碌的佈置着，那邊合浦鎮上，陳鎮長的忙碌也不亞於葉團長。他從蔡和豐走後，心上就好像壓着塊大石頭似的，正所謂食不甘味，寢不交睫，一面忙着在外面　喜事，一面又忙着在家裏辦喪事，叫親信家人用絲綿把秀月的屍體包紮了起來，浸在石灰裏。　　外面用布蓋着，好在舊歷正月天氣還很冷，把屍體在家裏擱兩天，還不至於腐爛發臭，所以他很放心的來幹這套偷天換日的把戲。　　在秘密通知了船戶把船開往楓林鎮去後，陳鎮長忽然有些担心起來，他深恐葉團長的軍隊不能準時反攻過來，則事情就不免要敗露，而他也將難免一死。對於死，他倒並不恐懼，因為他早抱着「不成功，便成仁」的決心，不過自己白白的死掉，敵人却不傷毫髮，這是他死也不能甘心的。他決定一不作，二不休，要死便和敵人一起死，於是便信步走向存心堂藥舖來。　　存心堂藥舖老闆沈天孫，和陳鎮長素來很熟，看見陳鎮長走來，便在櫃檯裏賠笑拱手說：陳鎮長，大喜啊！你這回可爬上高枝去了！」　　陳鎮長聽了這話，眼淚都險些流將出來。他想：秀月已經死了，旁人還不明白自己的苦心，還含譏帶諷的一位自己甘心把女兒去獻媚敵人呢——但他也未便顯露聲色，只好信口支吾說：「那裏！那裏！」　　「近來貴忙得很，怎麼又工夫到小號來玩？」　　「忙到也不忙，因為這兩天舍下老鼠鬧得很厲害，把許多禮品都咬壞了，所以想問老闆要帖砒霜去藥藥老鼠。」　　沈天孫並沒有懷疑到陳鎮長別有用心，而且無論怎樣也想不到喜事要和要砒霜會發生什麼聯帶關係，所以很老實的用藥　稱了四兩砒霜給他。　　陳鎮長把砒霜揣在懷裏，又來見宣撫班長說：「大家辛苦了這許多時候，難得逢到宣撫班長的喜期，又是小女于歸的吉日，我想趁這機會開一個狂歡大會，讓大家都盡量的樂上一樂，鬧一個痛飲達旦，不醉無歸，不知宣撫班長以為怎樣？」宣撫班長因為陳鎮長已經是他的老丈人，當然言聽計從，並且覺得自己的喜期，也實在有讓大家共同慶祝一下的必要，於是便議定把結婚禮堂和狂歡大會都設在已經做了「維持會」會址的鄉公所裏，外面做禮堂，裏面開狂歡大會。（四二）</p>

<p>交通與運輸週刋如何運貨至內地  景洵　　凡有貨物擬運往內地者，依據最近由滬出發至西南西北之交通綫，僅有取道寗波或溫州，然後再循浙桂聯運通車前往內地。或取道越南海防，再由滇越鐵路火車裝運至昆明，然後由昆明循公路運往重慶或其他各地。現在先將取道越南之運輸概况，略述於後：　　貨物之欲出口，應先辦報關手續，關於此點，諒讀者大都熱稔，無庸贅述。由輪船裝運至越南海防，上海太古及怡和兩公司，有輸由滬直接駛往：唯因貨物擁擠，須預先登記後，方允的期裝運。該二公司之水脚收取辦法，以噸爲單位（四十立方英尺或二千磅合一噸），凡係雜貨每噸收費國幣四十二元五角，布疋每噸五十六元二角五分，棉紗每包十五元。在入越境時，需納過境稅，國貨值百抽一，洋貨值百抽四。貨物抵防後，如欲運人桂省者，可由海防裝船至河內四九公里之富良商，藉可縮短陸運路程，由富良商即可轉裝火車至同登，經鎭南關轉入桂省各地。如擬裝至昆明者，則可由防直接裝滇越路火車至滇，唯滇越鐵路車輛　有十噸與二十噸兩種，該項車輛，俗稱車兜，車身係木製，容量不大，並不能儘量裝貨；更兼最近囤積在海防之各種貨物，竟達八萬餘噸之多。該鐵路公司預計每月可裝運四千至五千噸，每噸取費越幣一百二十元。綜觀上述情形，該路運輸，實難暢通。　　至由昆明運往西南西北各地：其運輸情形，更見困難，據最近消息，該段郵包，現在停止裝運，如有貨物擬欲裝運者，公路汽車，取費較廉，依照定章，由昆明至重慶之貨物每噸收費國幣的五百元。但欲求得公路汽車裝運，實難如登天，蓋該項汽車裝運公家貨物，尙感不敷，每有空餘，則早巳預定一空。設由商車裝運，其取費較昂，每噸取費，在國幣一千三百元左右，且車輛近甚缺乏，得一商車，亦非易事也。　　最近由昆明至四川之叙府，正擬築叙昆鐵路，現雖已有公路可通，但當局爲節省汽油計，以馬車運貨。馬由小隊壯丁押運，並以每三十公里爲一驛站，預計需時四十二日可達，經試辦後，成績尚佳。其運費亦相當高昂，但舊有之商辦鴃運運輸，其方法係以每馬　貨八十公斤，昆叙間叫十日可達，因其信用可靠，委運者亦多，但是其運費亦復甚高。總之，上述馬車或馬　運輸，其危險性頗多，非在萬不得已時，以不採用此法爲宜。關於取道浙東之運輸情形，俟有機會，當再詳細叙述。怡和新輪穏快舒適　　英商怡和洋行，擁有鉅輸多艘。各輸不僅以行駛穩快，膾炙衆口，對於旅客供應方面，允爲舒適週到。行駛各輪中，如德生號，速率十五海浬，係於一九三五年開班，其後加入者，爲泰生及永生兩輸，其速與德生同，但設備等等允佳。現又加入怡生，裕生，和生，及明生等四新輸，行駛於天津及海防間，旅客尤感莫大便利。出國護照　領取辦法  寳　　（甲）赴美游歷或留學之護照　　凡赴美游歷者，應備四寸半身照片六張，往發照機關請領護照。該機關所發者，除護照外，先給第六項證書一紙，（Seetion　six　Certificate）但現在上海情形特殊，可持照片二張，逕往江海關二樓總務處請領第六項證書即可。此項證書，經美國領事加簽後，効力等於護照，惟證書內所列各條，有須由美領事填注，或由持照人自填者，概照本地情形辦理。倘未得美領關照，幸勿隨意填寫。至持第六項證書往就近美國領事署加簽蓋印時，應備四寸半身照片三張，及游美經齊保證信，（由國內大銀行出信爲妥，內容大致謂持照人家產豐裕，足以供給在美游歷期內一切費用，如經濟困難，由保證人担保。）經美國領事審查合格，方允簽第六項證書。迨放洋期近，再將醫生證書，定艙位憑據，呈美領事，並付簽字費美金二元半，山美領事加簽　印後，再給無定額移民入境證書。（Nouquata　Immigration　Visa　form　256-CoNsular）G.I.C.No.926.此項證書，與第六項證書，均交船公司閱看。　　如係赴美留學者，須要領到敎育部留學證書，並接到美國大學入學憑信，然後持留學證書，按照上述辦法，同樣辦理。惟請美領事加簽時，當須有美大學入學憑證，本國學校畢業證書，校長或敎務長及英文敎員之介紹信，與留美經濟保證信等，同時送去。領事簽證費，爲美金十元。　　（乙）赴昆明經法屬安南之護照　　（一）國人赴越南者，須向政府請領護照。如無中國政府所發護照，係初决由港首途者，可向香港大道中佛蘭西銀行五樓外交部簽證處請領，須繳呈四寸半身照片三張。（全家合領者可攝在一起）及填具領照事項表二份，由港地殷實店舖，或司理人簽章祖保，連同護照費二元及印花稅費四元，親自送交該處，討回收據，的四五天後，再持收據前往領取　　（二）護照領得後，尚須持向香港德輔道中亞力山打行頂樓法國領事館，繳納簽證費一元，聲請加簽，的期四十八小時後，可以取得。（三）如原來　領有護照，或海防河內廣州灣法當局所簽發之過境證或入境證尚未失時效者，（按過境證期限，爲四個月，入境證期限爲一年）雖每决簽護，祗限用一次，但仍可持向法領館重簽，付費港幣一元，依舊有效。（四）護照計分過境與入境兩種，如經越南赴雲南或廣西者，停留時間，在十四天以內，領過境照，吾則須領入境照。（五）領照及簽證費如决：（一）『過境照』外交部簽證處，收護照費及印花費共六元。法領館收證費一元。（二）『入境照』外交（部簽證處收護照費四元，印花費四兀，共八元。法領館收簽證費七兀五角。（均係港幣）（六）領照及聲請簽證手續甚繁　，本社可以代客辦理，每張另收手續費二元。（七）所領護照，上船時即由船上管事人收去，備供海防警署查騐及簽註入口時日。抵越後，可托本社或旅館轉向華商會館代領，繳納慈善費越幣七角。（八）入境簽證時，須將異日出境之途程報明，（冽如擬赴雲南或廣西或由西貢出口）因出境時須重將護照交當地警署經辦出境簽證之手續，前後必須符合也。（九）入境後，如對出境途程改變計劃，可再送請警署重行簽證。（十）旅客中如領得過境照者，抵越後最多不得超過十四天，倘　事阻而致逾期者時，可由該地殷實商號代爲申請延期，吾則須罰越幣五元，並繳居留稅。（一年十六元，半年十二元，三個月八元。）浙東公路  惲　　浙東公路，自金華至各處之開車時刻及價目，茲據　查，露佈加决：　　（一）金甬聯運通車　上午八時在金　站開，票價十一九七角。淮該車至橫漲時，須改搭輪船至寗波，全程一天可達。　　（二）金華至麗水（由麗水轉赴靑田至溫州）快車上午七時半，下午一時正，各開一班，票價五元。慢車上午八時正，下午一時半，各開一班，票價四元二角。　　（三）金華至長樂上午七時開，票價五元四角。至長樂後，改乘商辦汽車至嵊縣新昌，轉赴橫漲，搭小輸亦可至甬，全程最快二天可達。滇越路將增加新車  寶晨　　自粵漢兩地，相繼淪陷後，所有運往內地之貨物，祇有取途海防，轉滇越鐵路運往之一法。惟以滇越鐵路貨車，噸位過少，車輛不多，近月以來，貨物運往該埠者，又川流不息，以致囤積太多，一時不能輸運。據上月中旬調查，運往內地進口貨物，堆積該地者，共有八萬餘噸之多，而滇越路每月能裝儎之貨物，則僅四五千噸，故卽各地不再運往，亦須十數個月，始能運淸。現在當地倉庫，均告貨滿，對於新來貨物，極感困難。法當局有鑒於此，正在添建新倉，並擬限制船公司，以後運防貨額，不能超過五千噸之意，茲聞滇越路爲謀貨運早日暢通起見，已造就新車百輛，五個月後，可全部完工，專供客貨運輸之用，屆時情形，當可較佳矣。行旅常識（一）  琅　　坐飛機　（一）坐飛機不能多帶行李，每人祇能帶十五公斤，每超過一公斤，要照票價百分之一收費的，最好到皮箱店去買專門乘飛機所用的皮包，那是有一定尺寸的，比較有標凖一點。（二）假如坐在飛機上，覺得空氣不大新鮮的話，可以將靠窗戶處的養氣球放在鼻子旁邊，就可以舒服多了。（三）要是怕吐的人，上飛機以前，還是少吃東西，多吃點酸性的水菓。（四）當飛機上下的時候，十個人有九個人的耳朶是要痛的，公司裹雖然有棉花發給乘客，預備　耳，减少痛苦，但是仍然不能完全生效。最好的法子，是當痛的時候，急將手緊捻鼻孔，則耳痛可减。旅行通問　　本埠　張懷之間：（一）由浙江上岸，是吾須要通行證。（二）如要通行證，則具有何種資格，方能擔保。（三）沿途大都市，能吾停留。（四）滬甬航行，有無困難。（五）湖南與陝北間之交通情形若何？　　答：（一）在浙江各口岸登陸，均須具有保證書或通行證，方允登岸。（二）該項通行證，須由溫州當地殷實商行保證，方爲有效。（三）登岸後，則在沿途各地停留，絕無問題，（四）滬甬航行，現有輸船常川行駛，行旅並無困難。（五）由湘至陝，以循公路經貴陽，重慶，成都等地前往爲宜，詳細情形，請駕臨中國旅行社面詢。　　本埠　張天利問：（一）往重慶最低的旅費要多少？它的路徑是怎樣？需要多少時間可達該處？（二）何處學校爲最多（內地）？貴社內地的招待處在那幾處地方？（三）旅行時需要的用品是什麼？　　答：（一）自滬赴渝，以取道海防，昆明，貴陽爲宜，滬至海防　輪船行種十日，　低旅費爲國幣三十七元。海防至昆明乘火車，行程快車一日，慢車四日，三等車價的合國幣五十二元。昆明至貴陽乘公路汽車，行程三日，票價二十九元一角五分。貴陽至重慶，行程二日，票價二十一元五角。（二）內地學校，以昆明及重慶爲最多。西南西北沿公路重要車站，均有招待所及食堂。（三）旅行時需要用品，大抵為毛巾，毛毯，牙刷等日用品，最好備些金雞納霜九，以避　疾。旅行通問簡則　　一、讀者如有關於行程，旅費，以及交通問題不明瞭者，可投函詢問。　　二、問題　簡愈佳，最多不得超過一百字。　　三、來函須附貼下列印花，否則不覆。　　四、函件請逕寄「申報館交通與運輸編者」，除於報端答復外，不另函復。增加汽車效能之建議  敷　　汽缸上部潤滑之重要性　　新式高壓縮率與高速度之汽車引擎，因活塞之距隙較小，活塞環之裝置較緊，故往往不能從拐軸箱中取得充分之潤滑，而在始動之際，遂難免於磨損；蓋無以抵禦凝聚汽缸壁上汽油之冲刷也。至當引擎煞住之時，汽缸內大都積有水與一養化炭，凡此均爲燃餘品，即皆足以腐蝕汽缸壁者，據此可知汽缸壁與活塞環之磨損，實始動與煞停之兩種舉動，有以致之。故始動與煞停之决數，如果較少，則走過十萬英里之汽車，其汽缸上部之磨損程度，輒較僅走過三萬英里，於尋常駕駛情形下，但未經適當頂部潤滑之汽車爲愈。是以車主果欲善爲保持新式引擎之效能，洵宜對於頂部潤滑，加以密切與嚴重之注意。　　美孚出品「無比」上汽缸油，爲提煉精純之輕質石油，含有濃厚之油質，其特點爲：　　一·具有特殊潤滑性，即其油質價值特高。　　二·能避免膠結與炭積之產生。　　三·保護面層，使無腐蝕之虞。　　四·具有散佈及無孔不入之特性。　　按如以「無比」上汽缸油加人汽油中，則其所含有之特殊潤滑成份，遂爲上汽缸壁所吸收，而形成一種足資保護之安全膜。除具有潤滑與减抑腐蝕性至最低限度之兩重功用外，如在寒天，並能使汽車之始動，彌感便利。　　再因此油富於散佈性，故雖極難到達之各部位，亦殊易於透入而潤滑之。至於膠結粘滯之汽門，並可因此而轉趨於靈活。「無比」上汽缸油，對於束縛炭積之膠質，並有溶解之作用，故確能减少炭積之產生，並保護活塞環之自由。按如上述種種功用，蓋皆對於引擎效能之增進，與壽命之延長，以及汽油哩程之增加，磨損程度及修理費用之减低，具有密切關係者也。愛護引擎之多數車主，以「無比」上汽缸油效用至宏，而代價則殊低廉，故咸樂用之。</p>

<p>春秋「沉默的凱旋」  流風　　帶着「沉默」而「凱旋」歸國，這似乎是世間並沒有的事。照理「凱旋」該是多麼的熱鬧呵！不「舉國若在」，「凱旋」將成爲不可思議的了。　　然而，我們的「友邦」，却有着一沉默的凱旋」這一「玩意兒」。我把我們「友邦」的「沉默的凱旋」却呌做「玩意兒的，倒並不是含有一絲一毫的諷嘲的意味在內，實在因爲這種「沉默的凱旋」是一種首創」，而我的行文的措辭又是非常拙劣，一時找不到適當的用辭，沒法，只得把「沉默的凱旋」當它作「玩意兒」了。　　逼令女子學梭里的姑娘們，拿着小小的紙國旗，婉轉着淸脆的歌喉，唱出勉强的愛國歌曲，激勵着「出征」的「軍人」，這在「友邦」的報紙上是渲染成爲一樁很是熱鬧的新聞。然而「出征」的「軍人」裝在瓶子里變作「骨灰」被帶回來的時侯，在「友邦」的「京都日日新聞」報紙上是稱做「沉默的凱旋」的！　　「友邦」在我們中國國土上進行的「建設東亞新秩序」的戰爭，的確是在天天地勝利，這只要看他們自國內報章上天天有「沉默的凱旋」可見出來了。　　「骨灰」當然不會「開口」，然而爲了完成「聖戰」而把自己的「生命」犧牲了，這旣然被報紙稱作「凱旋」，那末也當然是「沉默」的了！　　不過「骨灰」旣已不會說話了，而與「骨灰」有關的至親好友，擴大之是「骨灰」的「候補者」，與「眞理」的擁護者們，他們却會說話的。就是「京都日日新聞」上登載這「沉默的凱旋」中就是一段悲慘的「骨灰之語」。　　那就是這位「沉默的凱旋者」的妻子，洗好操，穿着整齊的衣服，到她這位「沉默的凱旋者」的丈夫的墓前去自殺。雖然是妻子的「自殺」，然而顯然是「骨灰」借了妻子的「自殺」而在作着一段「悲慘的控訴」，向着全國的人民！　　其外，東京街頭屢有發現的「反戰標語」，這也是一種「凱旋」的「沉默者」的「沉默之言」，至於大阪火藥庫的爆炸，那是因天天「凱旋」而不忍「沉默」的一種「雷聲歡動」的表示了！　　「凱旋」是永不會有「沉默」的，卽使「京都日日新聞」上有，那也不過是「友邦」另一小部分人的「沉默的凱旋」吧？要不是，那就是一種因「三月」不能達到「目的」而在作着一種「自我安慰」了！　　「沉默的凱旋」，是日本法西斯軍閥所創舉，然而也是他們在中國唯一的所得！飛將軍造像  荷子作逼上梁山  燕華　　“They　Made　Me　a　Criminal”　　華納公司出品　國泰戲院開映　　在「他們把我造成一個罪犯」的主題之下，假如能够透過深刻地社會批判，辯證地把主人公寫成一個由純潔無私地少年，然後漸漸造成他欺詐，陰險，暴戾，兇橫的性格，由眞實地人情中，去找出這社會環境給予人類罪惡的時候，那麼，這樣影片，才會顯示它給予這一代人類的警覺性與它的啟示。　　在電影藝術的園地裹，我們如使一接觸到這些問題，我們必須正視着這問題的核心，非常積極地指出一個在銀幕上出現的悲劇人物，他的週遭正患着糜爛性的病態的險症，而且也必須指出，我們怎樣才可以救治這個危險的病像。　　但是對於一般美國電影，（在麻醉性的糜爛的內容裏）我們是不能予以苛刻的期望的。　　比如，「逼上梁山」，正如我前面說過，我們如使把它寫成一個由良善純潔而變成兇暴險詐的罪犯，這一定是會深刻動人的，但是美國的劇作者是很少會這樣做的，「逼上梁山」當然又何能例外？　　他所寫的故事，只是很浮面的：它寫一個職業拳擊家，人家以罪名推卸在他的身上，他不得不過着流亡的生活，他於是走得遠還地，到了一個棗團裏，他停留下來，那裏有一個年靑的女郎和一個年老的老祖母，此外還有六個流浪的孩子，一齊種植那個棗園，他就在這棗園裹爲他們工作，從此他變換了姓名，和六個孩子伴得很好，並且也和那女郎愛上了。　　但在拳擊會裏，他被一個偵探發覺了，偵探想把他帶走，但看到他左右的人物對待他那麼好，而且過去的罪犯確也不是他幹的，便把他放走了。　　劇作者寫下這個故事，顯得非常軟弱無力，他的缺點，可以指出三點：　　（一）約翰去參加鬥拳的動機，寫得很糢糊，雖然後面老祖母說明，的翰的鬥拳是爲了他們，但劇本上沒有寫出棗園經濟困難的情形。　　（二）的翰與六大亨的感悄，沒有寫得更深刻，尤其是在大水桶中游泳一塲，寫得太浮糊了，因此後來棗園女郎來挽留他，表示她爲了的翰救了六個孩子而對他表示好感，這中間，轉變過程寫得很不够。　　（三）偵探由決定帶他走，直到火車將聞行時，又放了他，劇作者對於偵探的心理轉變過程，同樣是非常不够，因之，這劇本的收束，也顯得軟弱無力。　　導演者的手腕，也並不能顯示出他突出的地方，要算好的，還是拳擊塲中的會塲空氣，以及大家歡迎的翰參與拳擊，當約翰說不打的時候，一種由興奮轉入靜默，以及女部的啜泣，情感空氣都把握得相當强固。　　大水桶中游冰一塲，導演是完全失敗的，他沒有利用道個塲面達到預期的高潮。　　「四千金」中出現的舞台新人的翰茄斐爾，臉部的戲很多，如被大家講他不敢去比賽時的痛苦情緒，臉部肌肉變化很多，他是一個能演戲的演員。　　六個小大亨因劇本的限制，不能充分演戲，這是很可惜的。在第一單區兒童收容所  慈雲　　孩子們活躍在膳廳課堂亭子運動塲以及每個角落裏。　　這裏是在滬西越界築路地段的一個戰區兒童收容所，在戰前本是一個高貴的中學校的地址，因爲鑒於環境的不安而遷移到慈淑大樓了，所以這裹的校舍就讓給慈幼協會作收育孤苦伶仃的兒童塲所了。　　因爲過去是一個中學校，所以全部的面積是相當的廣大，一切學校的設備也是完備的，在目前孤島上像這樣設備的學校恐還是罕見的吧？所有一個學校具備的條件，這裏大致是應有盡有，諜堂禮堂膳廳浴室病房診療室圖書館運動塲，這裹孩子們底生活要比其他收育兒童的塲所幸福多多了。　　共計收容的孩子是六百五十名左右，其中女孩子佔四分之一，年紀自五六歲起至十三四歲，這些孩子們大部份是無家可歸的孤兒，他們被慈善團體警務機關派送到這裹的，沒有爹娘，沒有兄弟姐妹，他們底家庭全死在敵人的殘酷屠殺下了，他們自已在千鈞一髮的生死關頭中被大人們從敵人的槍口下奪下來的，這一羣孤苦伶仃的孩子們大多是從戰區中被救護出來的喲！另外一部份孩子是鄰近平民窟住戶送來寄養的，這樣不但可以减少家長的負担，並且還可以有受敎育的機會了。　　一個孩子底生活表和一個寄宿在小學校底學生是同樣的過着有秩序的生活，晨起至晚睡之間，分配着適當的上課退課休息運動娛樂自修的時問；星期日照例是休息日，不過孩子們是不能出去的；每天除了膳食之外，還可吃孩子們自己動手做成的豆腐漿；每星期洗澡二次或三决，所有的衣服換下來用沸水泡洗，這是雇工人担任的，每天膳食採取分食制，每桌共十個兒童，他們都是立着吃飯的。　　星期天是孩子們最活動的一天，膳廳裏在飯前飯後變成了乒乓室。三個方桌拼成一只，乒乓檯孩子們輪流的拍：在花國中的亭子裏，團團的圍繞了的一羣在玩或看踢鍵子的遊戲；在運動塲上賽跑或踢橡皮球；在課堂裏高級的學生正謄寫着壁報；另外一間課堂裏孩子們正玩調龍燈的玩意兒。　　這裹充滿着活力，不像有些地方的孩子那樣呆笨，到處顯示出活潑自然精神的空氣，孩子們有自治會的活動，在這樣的環境下，孩子們底智力體力都可平衡的發展了。啓事　　洞天先生：　　有信囑轉交，現存本館收發處，見報請來領取。　春秋編輯部雨過天青  包天笑　　第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　叙友情二土會羣英　　到了明天早晨，朱愛人一早就出去，忙於她的工作了。共餘住在這裹的幾位，也出去了，連老章醫師也到醫院中去了。隔夜，朱愛人早給她們兩位小姐說：『我們在工作的時候，不能陪你們，很爲抱歉！』何家兩位小姐說道：『你不必擔心，我們儘可自由游玩。』所以她們兩人，也自己出去散步一回。覺得這個安樂鎭，雖然是個不大的市鎭，而人人安居樂業，眞實符了安樂兩字。她們走得離鎭遠一點，便有些顯出鄉村模樣，然而這種鄉村，也可以看得出有一種豐腴景象。因爲這些鄕村人家，都是養蠶人家，所以離鎭不遠，便見到許多桑田。這些桑田，有的都歸集體養蠶塲所有，只要看它樹立的界石，便可以知道。至於如何種植，如何施肥，每年都有專家出來指導。因爲在蘇州滸墅關，有一個極大的蠶業學校。由這蠶業學校，每年指派專家，到各處養蠶區域去指導的。所以各處桑田，都非常茂沃。再走過去是一個牛奶棚。這個牛奶棚，雖不甚六，但從外面望進去，却很淸潔。原來這個牛奶棚，也是附屬於章醫師這個婦孺醫院的。章醫師初設立這個醫院時，一切都是草創，這安樂鎭的周圍，並沒有個比較淸潔的牛奶棚。因此就自己辦了個小規模的牛奶棚，到後來，醫院裏用得很多，又創辦了個育嬰院，自然牛奶的需要，益發多了。所以單就婦孺醫院及育嬰院兩處，便要供給不少，何况現在這個鎭上，飮牛乳的人，日益多呢？再走過去，是到了一個溪邊，溪傍竹籬茅舍，是有幾家人家。沿着溪畔，是有幾個石磴，她們兩人便分坐在石磴之上，略事休息。只見一泓碧漾漾的秋水，水旁長着靑蒼的蘆　，還有那一叢叢帶着淺紅的蘆花。因爲何家兩位小姐，一向生長在都市之間，那些蘆花淺水的風景，她們都不曾看過，倒覺得別饒風味。偶然見溪的對岸，常有人背着一筐子柴，緩緩的行來，悠然自得。她們坐了一晌，便即步行回家，也不知道到了那裹。到了家裹，不一刻兒，她們也都回來了。因爲那時候，漸漸到了吃中飯時刻。（六九）</p>

<p>游藝界談「坐宮」引子與定場詩  張古愚　　「坐宮」是「探母」中之首折。奎派「探母」是重母子。兄弟。兄妹。夫妻生雕之「哭堂」。删「哭堂」長詞，而偏重於「坐宫」，則始自余三勝：蓋余自知其嗓音，纏綿有餘，悲壯不足也。連頭帶尾而演全本者，（不带回令）却是譚鑫培首創。譚嗓固不及當時奎派諸子，但脸上，身上，水髮，吊毛之有功，則豈是龍長勝輩所能望其項背？譚派流傳日廣，奎派繼起乏入，故今日之學「探母」者，皆以譚氏為依歸云　　奎余派引子不同　　奎派「探母」引子是：「被困幽州思老母，常掛心頭。」余派是：「金井鎖梧桐，長嘆空隨一陣风。」其實奎派比余派為佳。引子是一劇中之主題，猶劇本之總綱，若余派之「金井鎖捂桐，長嘆空隨一陣風」，意議既不及奎派通達，文義又是異常費解。據名伶芙蓉草語余：「金井是鳥名，北地本有此烏，」果爾，則此引尚屬清通，（至於鄭大哥過宜，蘇少卿君范松凰君等對此引之見解，皆有强辭達理之嫌。）不過總不如「披困幽州思老母。常掛心頭」來得順通，而且音節方面亦比較雄渾。甫北評劇界中有幾位著名的前輩，竟都說此引子是譚鑫培採取於漢劇，聞之令人可笑。余屢觀漢班名三生吳三保陳二紅（即十二紅）演「坐宫」，（此　吳陳皆稱拿手）皆由楊延輝在宫院自思自嘆」之倒板出場。扮相與平班相同，惟手執摺扇。）初未見有引子與定場詩也。詢諸老伶工余洪元，亦云未聞。此輩大言不慚。難乎其為名家也。　　譚氏修改定場詩　　定場詩有念：「沙灘赴會動　貅，失落番邦十五秋；高堂老母難叩首，怎不叫人淚雙流。」有念：「沙灘赴會十五年，雁過街陽各一天：高堂老母難得見，怎不叫人淚漣漣」前者為老詞，使者為譚詞，譚氏之所以修改老詞，因是劇公主太后關將之詞多為言前轍。故将楊四郎之定場詩亦改為言前；不過譚派老生中，亦有仍念老詞者。　　時季矛盾答客問　　　有客問余曰：「公主主唱詞分明是春天，（芍藥開牡丹放花紅一片，艷陽天春光好百鳥聲喧。）而楊延輝之定場詩中又有「雁過衡陽各一天」句。二者豈非矛盾乎。」余反問曰：「何以矛盾？」客曰：「燕來在春，雁來知秋，雁過衡陽來，非秋日耶？」余曰：「君誤矣。幽州居北國，大宋佔南地，所以在「雁過衡陽」下加「各一天」三字：雁南來知秋，北歸在春。雁過衡陽而到北方去，得無春乎！何來矛盾？客復曰：「依君之言，則四郎探母是在春日。」余笑曰：「君不見四郎唱詞中有「蕭天佐，擺天門，兩國會戰。老娘親，押糧草，來到北番。」耶？番邦在擺陣，宋營正運糧，可知雙方尚在備戰中。古代戰爭必待秋收以後，四郎探母必在春日無疑。」影星化裝之新發明  （紹焯）　　美國電影演員現通用一種有塑形效用的質體，名「第六號一（NO.6)。此種化裝物乃化裝師湯桀克所發明。其優點有三；（一）無論何種面相，均可隨心所欲，即時扮成，手續之間便，遠非從前之化裝術所能及。（二）此種化裝物塗於面部，成一薄面具，然面部種種表情，如微笑大笑呵欠皺眉等，仍能照常表現，不爽毫釐。（三）此種化裝物為質疏鬆而能吸汗，既為塗敷，而抹去時亦不致損及皮膚。　　「絕代艷后」一片中飾路易十六至羅實摩利，即由湯桀克用「第六號」為之化裝，惟妙惟肖，巧奪天工，若以路易十六之橡片與之對照，將不信其為好萊塢之演員，而疑為十八世紀末葉之法皇再世也。精武體育會　戲劇音樂的活動  呆子　　　「八一三」之後，情武體育會就由砲火中　把總會所遷至大陸商場三樓。該會除專別注重國術與武技的訓練以外，還有其他各種活動，範圍很廣門類極多。而本文所報道的，祇是關於戲劇和音樂的活動。　　話劇　　精武體育會的話劇組，還是新近成立，方於去年十二月二十日開成立會。加入該組的主要人員，是朱廉湘，周富興，陶天聞，陳允章，涂昌耀，翁長甯，羅劍華，邵元釗，盧洪，沈晋康，歐仁良，屠恒耀，徐少霞，童培慶，石品海，尤靜娟，范甸夏，田毓榮，胡俊民，沈錫三，夏武莘，林遐年，余佛等。由朱湘兼為主任，吳仞之，華沙，徐以　三君分仟指導。每星期練習三次，時間為星期二三五下午六時至八時。並由田毓榮担任教讀劇本，以求語音的正確。現正排演二幕劇啞妻」一父歸」等，待排練純熟之後，再行試演。　　京劇　　京劇也是精武體育會音樂科下面的一種活動。該會的會員，都可加入，每月收费二元，全年二十元二每年由大會公推委員，分任劇務，會計，文書等職務。除星期日外，每天下午八時至十時，是練習的時間．每年排彩色一次，在排彩以前，練習時間要比平時加長。現由錢養田王潤卿二君，担任教導之職。　　粵樂　粤樂分甲乙雨班，甲班是高班，乙班是低班，每星期上課三次，時間為下午七時三刻至八時三刻。甲乙兩班，隔口輪替。粤樂部的設立，目的在使會員研究音樂，歌曲，陶冶性情。會員的加入者，除付保證金而外，不收任何費用。但一經報名加入，如果不能按時上課的，定有罰則，要照章處　。樂器由學員自備，担任教導為陳俊英君。該班的全體學員，不久之前，更會參加新新電台廣播，籌款救濟難民，成績頗佳。　　　　　口琴　　口琴隊是新近設立的，口的在提倡民眾音樂，每星期授課三次，每次一小時。專授口琴之各種最新吹法，樂購符號之認識，中西流行名曲，和一切口琴藝術的要决。以三個月為一期，會員收報名費一元，非會員全期三元。聘請口琴專担任指導。舞國寫影  小田逛舞塲的趣味　　梁任公先生說：「倘若用化學來分化，梁啟超這件東西，把裏頭所含一種元素名叫趣味的抽出來，只怕所　下的僅有個零了。」梁先生是個主張趣味主義的人，他對於趣味的意義，會經下過一個註腳道：「凡一件事做下去不會」生出和趣味相反的結果的，這件事便可以為趣味的主體」，他又替趣味主義定下一個最重要的條件是：「五所為而為，」就是說不要以所為的事為手段，而以另一件事為目的；譬如說，為畢業證明而求學，那就是以取得證書為目的，而以求學為手段：為發财而做官，就是以發財為目的，而以做官為手段；為騙取刪善信女的錢財而做和尚，做慈善家，就是以騙錢為目的，而以做和尚做慈善家為手段；若是達不到目的時，那就會生出和趣味相反的結果了。　　根據上述的學理，所以我希望愛逛舞場的人們，要為愛逛舞場而逛舞場，不要為想達其他目的而逛舞場，如果目的在好熱鬧交際的，儘可揀熱鬧宴會場所去逛，加果喜歡聽西洋音樂的，家裏開開無綫電收音機，也是一樣，如果目的在追求女性的，也並非除了舞場就找不到和女性接近的機會。我贊同梁先生趣味主義的原則，不贊同梁先生除學問外找不到趣味的斷語。他說一賭錢趣味嗎，輸了怎麼樣？吃酒趣味嗎，病了怎麼樣」？我認為倘若為好賭而賭錢，就根本討論不到輸贏問题，所謂勝固欣然，敗亦可喜。若是為要贏錢而赌錢，那就不如以不赌錢為是。所以在未賭錢之先，必須要估量一下，輸多少錢是無關痛養的，那末輸錢就不會生出和趣味相反的結果了，吃酒也是一樣，祇要記着「惟酒無量不及亂」。的信條就是了。　　逛舞場當然是為找趣味，要是為找沒趣，世上那有人喜歡找沒趣的嗎。但是要保持始終有趣起見，不得不事先考慮一下，第一點是經濟問題，好比我上面說的賭錢是預備輸多少錢來賭的。第二點是不要有專一的對象，譬如說，你愛令這個舞女伴舞，同時被人也愛令這個舞女伴舞，別人先走到她面前．或是竟然叫去坐檯子或買　出去了，那時你若並不以　個舞女為專一對象，就不妨另選一個舞女來伴舞，也可以同　感到趣味。第三點除伴舞之外，不要有其他目的，關於這一點，其實上文已經說過了，但為詳盡起見，不妨再說幾句，譬如說，你喜歡和這個舞女同舞，因而令她伴舞，甚至叫她坐檯子，或買票到別家舞場去，都可以，伹必不可希望她也喜歡和你同舞，如果你愛她，也希望她爱你，那你的失望機會就有光降的可能了，豈不要生出和趣味相反的結果嗎？孔子說「君子求諸己，小人求諸人。」在這裏很可以應用一下。　　中法劇藝學校定今明日假環龍路法工部局大禮堂實習公演，圖為「小英雄」舞台之一。陳翠　飾小漁夫，獲得極大成功。  （林琳攝）上海的滑稽平劇社  梁言　　以滑稽的方式來演唱平劇，以博台下一笑，這確也是高尚娛樂的一種。目前在孤島上此種滑稽平劇社的組織，達六班之多，並且各有千秋，很能迎合觀眾的胃口，他們也會聯合起來，為難民請命，在更新舞薹會串過一次，成績可觀，可見受人歡迎的一班。現在特將各班的陣容，調查如下：　　新聲社　　以米一粟，房笑吾陳无我，徐嘯天為主角，最近加入一個八歲的小神童，陣容最為整齊，因為唯有這班可說是：生，旦，淨，丑都有，而小神童，有嗓子，有工架，更有噱頭。他們拿手的有「罵殿」一罵曹」「起解」「甘露寺」等等，現在大世界演出。　　雅　社　　演員為房人迷，王麻子，張蛤螟三人，他們合作的時間很長，所以搭配得最純熟。王麻子和張蛤螟合演「大補缸」一劇，最受人叫好，他如「一進宮」「法門寺」亦為拿手，在大新遊藝場表演。　　海新社　　這是三個女孩組織即花燕燕，鶯驚，飛飛，能戲甚　，惜因年紀太輕，殊欠老練，噱頭全無，現在永安天韻樓登台。　　新友社　　　　以坤角汪佩君為主幹，輔以楊山芋和大皮包，此三人都是大亨班裹出身，都各有可取，以「借東風」「空城計」為傑作，在大新游藝場出演。　　通俗社　　　　是以前唱北中滑稽的大娃娃為主角，再以赛蘭芳，戴笑麟和馬又良為配，以「法門寺「天女散花」為拿手，现在新世界演出。　　鳴樂社　　演員為倪東東，紅蘿葡和大麵包三人以「黄金合」為傑作。在先施樂團表演。　　　　　我以為各班都有缺點：如鬧場鑼鼓太長，唱平劇前喜唱南北小調，演唱的老是這幾　戲，所以希望他們加以改進，使滑稽平劇有光明的前途。故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二九）  徐慕雲　　因探母的出關說到西太后與安得海的關係　　今天他又是照常如此，當然別人也不以為意，誰料他刚一跨上騾子，冷不防把騾子的頭掉轉過來，加上一鞭，沒命的就望關裏飛奔了去，及至蘇王所派的心腹人拉了馬來，再追下去，巳經來不及啦。何况他的這匹快騾，是每天早晨趨慣了的，今天有事時，跑起來格外如飛的一般。小安子轉眼到了皇城，向眾大臣「宣讀聖旨，遂把蘇王等叛臣拿下，迎接西后還京。西後因此功全在安得海一人身上，所以後來寵幸非常，小安子年輕俊美，剃的青頭皮，梳條大辮子，更顯着令人可爱。他又不通世務，恃功而驕，有時在西后跟前，都露出輕薄不大知禮的樣子，因此外邊都說安得海舆西后有私，是個假太監，這話連外省的督撫都聽到了。適巧山東巡撫丁寶楨晉引見，此人是貴州平遠縣人，進士出身，會助平苗亂，及東捻西捻有功，為人果敢剛直，安得海瞧他也是個禿子，他也不知輕重，竟我笑老了一番。丁實楨本來就聽得他的　行，再加以今天尋到自已頭上，他一出京，可就做了他的飯啦。不枓該死的小安子，偏要討個出京製辦龍袍的差事，随帶大批人馬，沿途招搖，聲勢浩大，擾害百姓，勒案官府，不知造了多少罪孽，看看决到山東濟南，丁寶楨連接西后懿旨及皇上密旨兩道，據當時一般人傳說，都道新君及滿朝文武見小安子無法無天，特密議把他騙出京城，好借故除他，故而降密旨一道，令丁寶楨殺他。不想事被西后聞知，復降懿旨，命丁保護，她惟恐愛人被害，遂用八百里加緊的快馬，先將懿旨发達　坦，要在別人，也就將小安子放過去啦。老丁一來要報私恨，一来也想落一個剛直的名兒，所以竟不顧一切的，將懿旨壓下，等到安得海一抵濟南，就宣讀聖旨，把他拿下，按清律所訂，内监本屬皇家奴才，例不許離京一步，今以「私自出京」的罪名，就將紅極一時的安得海給殺了。棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　開局法　第二十三局　　黑先　　反宮馬對當頭砲橫車法　　着法接上局　　車一平六　車九平二　馬八進九　兵七進一　　（解釋）炮二平五至炮八平七，皆見前說，上局黑方馬八進七今改進九者，邊馬局，其意不在進攻中路，馬緩進法之穩健派，黑方車九進一横車，以横車對横車，各有千秋。　　　　　車一平六對方既應橫車故平六先佔要路，車九平二捉罵逼馬八進九，如此時不捉，則對方六離升車之後，馬叮進六，進六與邊馬相比，是進六較强，如紅方不先佔車路而先以馬進六則車又無路，故黑方車九進一確是好棋。本局紅方開局極工穩勁捷，然最忌者即對方亦出横車逼成驚馬，兵七進一禁馬，不使三路馬活動，即不使邊馬生根，為喑中牽制法，是時形勢雙方雖無大碍，在黑方自起横車之慢，着着逼緊，聲勢躍躍，而紅方在被迫之下，似乎難於活動。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Northern Jiangxi for Four Days and Nights: Chinese Troops Firmly Defend the Eastern Positions of Wuning; Japanese Main Force Crosses Tanxi to Invade from the South, All Attacks Repelled; Repeated Fierce Battles in Wucheng, Still in Chinese Hands; Japanese Troops in Southern Hubei Advance on Beigang Without Success</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guilin Dispatch: The war situation in northern Jiangxi is extremely tense. The majority of the Japanese troops have crossed the Xiushui River, with the main force located in Panxi City, southwest of Yongxiu. The vanguard has crossed Anyi towards Fengxin, attempting to encircle Nanchang. Fengxin is a hundred *li* from Nanchang. Nanchang Dispatch: The Japanese troops concentrated near various locations around Dean number over ten thousand, mostly transferred from Wuhan. The main force is distributed in areas such as Dean and Wuning. A portion of their artillery has been transferred from Nanjing. The Japanese troops advancing southwest between Ruoxi and Wuning are engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops in the nearby mountains. The Japanese troops in Jiujiang are also restless, and the Chinese guerrillas in Mount Lu are launching attacks on the Japanese troops. The Chinese and Japanese troops in Hubei are still engaged in a standoff across the Xiang River. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The center of gravity of the war situation has now shifted to northern Jiangxi, while the fighting in central Hubei has become subdued. Many of the Japanese troops in central Hubei have been transferred to Jiangxi Province to reinforce their forces. The Chinese and Japanese troops across the Xiang River are still facing each other across the river. There are occasional artillery battles in areas such as Yuekou. (Special dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>Xiushui: In order to cover the flanks of their forces crossing the Xiushui River to invade from the south, the Japanese army, starting on the 21st, dispatched a portion of the Sixth Division to advance from Ruoxi towards Jinkou, east of Wuning, which is held by the Chinese forces. For four days, they have been engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops in Jinkou. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. On the 24th, the Chinese and Japanese troops are still locked in a stalemate near Jinkou. The situation in Wuning is stable. Furthermore, another unit of the Japanese army harassed the area south of Zhalin, between Ruoxi and Baicha, but was also intercepted by the Chinese troops. (Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>Xiushui: Qian on the Nanxun front was sultry on the 23rd and suddenly cold on the 24th. It was as if the seasons changed in a day and night. The changes in the war situation in the highway area west of Qian are like the climate of these two days. It reached a high degree of intensity on the 23rd and turned stable on the 24th. Since a portion of the Japanese 106th Division forcibly crossed the Xiushui River at Gouziling, between Qiujin and Yongxiu, on the 17th, its main force has advanced along the highway to Tanxi by the 23rd, with a small number of tanks covering its troops, harassing the area south of Tanxi. It seemed that there was an attempt to bypass Nanchang along the highway and cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After the Chinese army bravely fought back, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, the Japanese army harassing the south of Tanxi were all defeated. The remaining Japanese troops have now retreated to Tanxi, and the Chinese army is intensifying its encirclement. The morale of the Chinese troops in the highway area is very high. Someone personally went to the front line to supervise the battle, and the situation immediately improved. Furthermore, in the area of Wucheng, east of Nanxun, the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks for a week with a combined force of land, sea, and air. A certain unit of the Chinese army is still bravely resisting. The fighting is quite fierce. As of the morning of the 24th, Wucheng is still firmly held by the Chinese army. As for the front of the Nanxun Railway, the Chinese army is still firmly defending a certain position on the south bank of the Xiushui River, with no changes to date. (Dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Well-informed sources say that 6,000 Japanese troops have crossed the Xiushui River and are now advancing along the highway towards Nanchang. The Japanese army's advance is assisted by the air force, so the front line of Nanchang and the city of Nanchang have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft in recent days.

<p>(Chongqing) According to a military report released here, there have been important fierce battles on the Nanxun Railway since March 18. The Japanese army's advance west of Poyang Lake is extremely slow. Although Wucheng has been constantly bombarded by Japanese gunboats, it is still firmly held by the Chinese army. (Dispatch from the 24th, Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to news received here, the Japanese army attacking Wuning suffered a major defeat due to a surprise attack by the Chinese army in Guanglingshan, 20 kilometers northeast of the area. It is reported that in addition to more than 800 soldiers killed, the Chinese forces also captured 44 machine guns and more than 400 automatic rifles.

<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese army advancing south from Yongxiu is currently being contained by the Chinese army at the Qian of Wanjiabu, Anyi, on the bank of the Fengshui River. The Japanese report that the Japanese army has reached Fengxin, 50 kilometers west of Nanchang, is completely inaccurate. It is reported that the Chinese army is still holding the line from Anyi to Wanjiabu, resisting the Japanese army's offensive. Also, due to the gradual approach of the war, the sound of artillery fire could be faintly heard in Nanchang yesterday, and the authorities have begun to evacuate the population. In Wuning, both sides are still in a standoff near Chenzhuang. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military personnel telling a reporter from the Express News Agency, the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi is now continuing to attack Nanchang fiercely. It is expected that the great bloody battle that will determine the fate of Nanchang will begin at the beginning of next week. The main force of the Japanese army is now continuing to advance southwest along the Liaoshui River on the west side of the Nanxun Road, attempting to cut off the transportation line between Nanchang, Wuning, and Changsha. The war is now gradually expanding from the area of Wucheng and Tujiabu on the west bank of Poyang Lake to the triangular area between the Fengshui and Liaoshui Rivers. The Japanese tank columns once broke into Wanjiabu, Anyi, Fengxin, and other places on the banks of the Fengshui River yesterday, but they have all been repelled by the Chinese army. Because all the fortifications of the Chinese army in Wucheng were destroyed by Japanese aircraft, they transferred to the southwest new positions last night to continue the resistance. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Japanese propaganda here, Fengxin, 50 kilometers west of Nanchang, has been invaded by the Japanese army. It is also said that after the Japanese army crossed the Xiushui River, it took the Yongxiu route to attack Fengxin. However, according to Chinese reports, the Japanese army is still being blocked by the Fengshui River, a tributary of the Xiushui River. All the bridges there have been destroyed by the Chinese army, and there are Chinese machine gun positions along the coast, so the Japanese army is still unable to forcibly cross the river. It is heard that on Monday and Tuesday (20th and 21st), the Japanese army did disregard everything and risked their lives to cross the river, but after the Chinese army calmly responded, more than a thousand men were annihilated, and more than six hundred and fifty men were captured. During this fierce battle, the Japanese side deliberately spread the news of the capture of Fengxin. (Dispatch from the 24th, Express News Agency)</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Forces in the Three Northeastern Provinces Are Extremely Active</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) General Li Du, Chairman of Jilin Province, is currently here. He told a reporter from the Associated Press that Japanese newspapers are trying their best to prohibit the publication of all patriotic movements in the three northeastern provinces. The volunteers in the three northeastern provinces are now redoubling their efforts to fight the Japanese army. The Japanese army's communication lines are often cut off, so they dare not go deep. The Japanese immigration policy cannot be implemented due to the repeated attacks by the guerrillas. At present, there are many guerrilla forces in various parts of the three northeastern provinces. Their weapons are all seized from the Japanese army. The more difficult their environment is, the more determined they become. Because the Chinese guerrillas constantly harass the Japanese army, the Japanese authorities dare not transfer the Manchurian defense forces to other places. It is learned that Li will soon leave Chongqing to take office. (Dispatch from the 24th, Associated Press)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of Repeated Five-Minister Conferences in Japan</h3>
<p>In recent days, the Hiranuma Cabinet of Japan has convened Five-Minister Conferences repeatedly. Prime Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, and Foreign Minister Arita attended, exchanging opinions on the recent situations in China and Europe. Although the Five-Minister Conference has no specific provision in the constitution of Japan, in recent years, when the cabinet encounters difficult problems in its administration, it often convenes a Five-Minister Conference to exchange opinions first, and then submit them to the cabinet meeting. Therefore, the convening of the Five-Minister Conference is tantamount to a reflection of the Japanese cabinet's administration hitting a wall. The Hiranuma Cabinet is now convening such conferences repeatedly, which is of course because it feels difficulties with the current situation and has to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Currently, according to the opinions of Itagaki and others, Japan's military action against China requires occupying Lanzhou in the north and Kunming in the south. This would allow them to control the two major international routes in northwest and southwest China, prevent foreign military supplies from entering China, and force China to surrender and end the war. However, their forces in China are not only insufficient to bear this heavy responsibility, but even to consolidate the so-called occupied areas is difficult. Therefore, to realize this plan, they must increase reinforcements from the country; however, there are no troops to be transferred within the country, so the plan cannot be realized, and the end of the war is indefinitely postponed. In addition, the general public is averse to war because they cannot bear the burden of the ever-expanding war expenses, and even evolves into a widespread anti-war movement. The Hiranuma Cabinet naturally feels vexed when it sees this situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, Japan's war of aggression against China has caused its economic panic. It was originally an imperialist with congenital deficiency. Although it is called an emerging industrial country, all it has is light industry, and there is fundamentally no basis for heavy industry. Moreover, it is pathetic that the raw materials for both heavy and light industries must be supplied from abroad, so it is already a country with an excess of imports over exports in peacetime. Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against China, a large number of military supplies have been continuously imported, increasing the excess of imports over exports, and the outflow of cash has also increased accordingly, to the point where there is a lack of gold reserves in the country, and the exchange rate of the yen has gradually fallen as a result, while the prices of imported raw materials and military supplies have risen in inverse proportion. At the same time, repeated increases in war expenses have created a huge deficit panic. In order to save this panic, they have used methods such as issuing public bonds indiscriminately, increasing taxes at will, and compulsory savings. They try every means to increase the burden on the people, but in fact, it is still a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. So they are considering using the methods of devaluing the yen and issuing banknotes indiscriminately. From the surface, the former can indeed lower the prices of their manufactured products, making them easier to sell in foreign markets, so as to save the crisis of excess imports, but the prices of all imported raw materials and military supplies will rise as a result, and the result may still be more loss than gain. As for issuing banknotes indiscriminately, it is even more dangerous, because the result of issuing banknotes indiscriminately will accelerate the rise in prices, and the stability of the currency will also be lost.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Europe, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the attitude of the democratic front has gradually become active, and it is organizing a united front to prevent German aggression. The development of this situation is naturally unfavorable to Japan, because once Germany is surrounded, there will be at least one less accomplice to its aggressive policies, which is something it is very concerned about. It has recently been trying its best to clarify that there is nothing remarkable about its relationship with Germany and Italy, and has recently released the smokescreen of "Emperor's personal rule" in an attempt to change the perception of it by countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, so that the increasingly unfavorable international environment for it will gradually become favorable. At the same time, it also sees that in East Asia, the opposition of interests with Britain is difficult to reconcile, so it has particularly expressed goodwill to the United States, wanting to dismantle the cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, so as to achieve its ambition of dominating East Asia.</p>
<p>The development of the above-mentioned aspects makes Japan's aggressive policy hit a wall everywhere. The convening of the Five-Minister Conference is to discuss a way to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties. However, although Japanese militarists have the courage to wager the entire national fortune on a single throw, they have no way to ease the anti-war sentiment of the domestic people, let alone the magic to change economic iron rules, and the diplomatic rhetoric wrapped in sugar cannot hide the ferocious face of attempting to dominate the Far East. So the result of this kind of conference is nothing more than a formality.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes China Exchange Balance Law on Third Reading; Simon Hopes Legal Tender Can Be Stabilized; Praises China for Maintaining Credit on Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>(London) The China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill passed its third reading in the House of Commons today without any dissent. It has now been submitted to the House of Lords for discussion. (Dispatch from the 24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon today brought the China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill to a third reading in the House of Commons, and made a speech requesting the House of Commons to pass it. He said, "Mr. Lawrence provided various opinions based on his past experience when the second reading was held on the 20th of this month. I have carefully studied them and feel that it is appropriate to maintain the original draft of this bill. However, one point needs to be stated, which is related to the supervision of finance. Regardless of the amount of money involved, the Ministry of Finance and the government attach importance to it, and so do the gentlemen of the House of Commons. Therefore, I still hope that Mr. Lawrence will not hesitate to give advice. Furthermore, when this case was in the second reading, I made it clear that the government's intention in this move is peace, not to make profits for the bank, but to support those who we should support. The method agreed upon by China and the United Kingdom this time is an innovation this year. This was revealed by Mr. Lawrence, and I completely agree. According to this method, the interest on the five million pounds provided by the two British banks is set at 2.75% per week. This interest is paid by the two Chinese banks, amounting to 137,500 pounds per year. We hope that China can gradually overcome the major difficulties encountered in its struggle, and we hope that the above methods can effectively help stabilize China's legal tender. I firmly believe that this move will be of great benefit to China. Once the 12-month period expires, this method may be extended or adjusted. In view of the current situation, this method is indeed very appropriate. All interest on loans from British banks is stipulated to be paid by banks on the Chinese side, and Chinese banks have the Chinese government as their backing. Regarding the repayment of foreign debt principal and interest, the Chinese government has excellent credit. If it can maintain this traditional policy in the future, I absolutely believe that it will be able to fully fulfill its obligations. Regarding the efforts of countries around the world to maintain their foreign debt credit, I dare say that no country is better than China. As for the loan interest rate, I am unwilling to modify it unless the situation changes, but I believe that it may change with the situation in one or two years." (Dispatch from the 24th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon brought the China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill to a third reading in the House of Commons, Lawrence, a member of the opposition Labour Party, immediately proposed an amendment, arguing that the interest rate guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance should not be higher than 2.75% per week. After discussion and voting, it was rejected by 72 votes to 33 votes. Then, using a show of hands, the original bill proposed by the government was passed on the third reading, and the China Exchange Equalization Fund Law was established. (Dispatch from the 24th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The China Exchange Equalization Fund Bill has been passed on the third reading by the House of Commons. Although the opposition Labour Party proposed an amendment beforehand, its meaning was not fundamentally opposed to the move. Labour MP Lawrence made an explanation in the proposed amendment, saying that the interest rate on loans from British banks under this bill is set at 2.75% per week, and the British government guarantees it. I think that if the Chinese and British sides decide to extend it when the 12-month period expires, even if the interest rate is appropriately increased, the British government's guarantee to its own banks should still be stipulated not to exceed 2.75%, so as not to increase the burden on the national treasury. Another Labour MP, Dinkle, continued to speak, saying that if the Chinese government is unable to pay the interest on this loan in the future and needs to be paid by the British government, I think the amount paid by the British government should not exceed 2.5%, because the interest rate on most securities in the London market is 2.5%, then although the agreed interest rate between China and Britain is 2.75%, if the British government needs to pay it in the future, it will not be too much to calculate it at 2.5%. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon immediately replied that the opinions of Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Dinkel are worthy of attention, but I think it is not necessary to add them to the bill, so as not to be cumbersome. In addition, Labour MP Lang also made a speech, expressing opposition. His wording and arguments were beyond what people generally expected. He said that although he agreed with giving China greater assistance in finance and economics, the bill proposed by the government was not very thorough, because the United Kingdom had previously lent funds to Czechoslovakia, and after Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany, this loan had all fallen into the hands of Germany. The past can be used as a lesson, so it is advocated that the government's bill should take into account this unexpected danger. (Dispatch from the 24th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei: Mysterious Whereabouts, Rumors of Secret Departure from Hanoi</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from Hanoi, Wang Jingwei was not present at the funeral of Zeng Zhongming in Hanoi at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, which was considered quite strange, given that Mr. Zeng's sacrifice was essentially as a scapegoat for Wang Zhaoming. It has now been ascertained that Wang Jingwei secretly departed after Zeng Zhongming was injured in the assassination attempt. It is rumored that he is no longer in Hanoi. As for the four assassins arrested by the French police, it is said that they are all suspects and not the real culprits. After investigations by the French police, none of the four have provided any substantial confessions. It is reported that the Hanoi authorities are still investigating the true assassins. (Express News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, a spokesperson for the Guangdong Army recently denied rumors that the Japanese would first withdraw their troops from South China to negotiate peace with China. They also stated that the Japanese army in South China would not be able to withdraw before Japanese military "objectives" were achieved. It is reported that this sudden statement from the Japanese side is a response to the demands of pro-peace elements in the Wang Jingwei faction seeking peace with Japan. Wang had sent people to Tokyo to request that the Japanese first withdraw their troops from South China to facilitate the propaganda of the Wang faction's peace proposals. The Japanese government initially agreed, believing that the war could be concluded, but the Japanese militarists deemed it a "grave mistake." Therefore, they suddenly expressed the South China Japanese army's strong stance through a spokesperson. (Express News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the assassination attempt on Wang Jingwei, former vice president of the Chinese Kuomintang, in Hanoi, French Indochina, local newspapers only briefly reported the news without adding any comments.

<h3>European Situation Calms Down, Compromise Atmosphere Released; Joint Declaration of Britain, France, Russia, Poland, etc. Fails; Germany, Content, Still Leaves Room for Expansion</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe, after Britain contacted the relevant countries, it originally planned two approaches: one was for Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland to issue a joint declaration, and the other was to convene an international conference in London or Paris in the short term. According to responsible sources, after a meeting today between British and French cabinet members, the above two approaches have been abandoned. However, through normal diplomatic channels, they will continue to exchange opinions with the relevant countries, especially Poland, the Soviet Union, and Romania. The British and French cabinet members decided on this new approach because Germany and Romania have already signed a commercial agreement, and European peace is no longer in imminent danger. In any case, the British and French governments should maintain close contact and cooperate with countries resisting aggression. The British and French cabinet members should meet again when necessary, but the date has not yet been definitively decided. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) London diplomatic observers say that while Germany is advancing on all fronts, the diplomatic authorities of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland are frequently exchanging opinions, but there seem to be no results. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky went to the Foreign Office today. It is heard that the Soviet Union's reply agreeing to sign the British-drafted anti-aggression declaration will soon be delivered to the British government. It is also heard that Poland, although very sympathetic to democracies, has some concerns and is still hesitating. It is still demanding that Britain and France provide a concrete guarantee that if Poland fights against Germany, Britain and France will support it, and that this is a prerequisite for Poland to join the declaration. Political circles here believe that the King of Italy's speech shows a willingness to establish good relations with various countries, but the world is still waiting for Mussolini's speech on Sunday.

<p>(London) Regarding the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe, official sources here recently declared that the Soviet government has unconditionally expressed its support. According to the draft's content, it is very simple, stating that peace-loving countries should always unite and consult each other immediately when emergencies endangering European peace arise in order to determine "steps to resist aggression." In addition, France has unconditionally expressed its support, but Poland refuses to accept. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan, a confidant of Stalin, has been specially recalled from vacation to greet British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson. Hudson met with a Reuters reporter today and said that he was deeply impressed by Mr. Mikoyan's affability. Hudson will have the first concrete discussions today on improving trade relations between the Soviet Union and Britain, and due to the recent events in Central Europe, their conversation may contain significant political implications.

<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons this afternoon was more conciliatory. There are two reasons for this: (1) British Chargé d'Affaires in Germany Forbes telegraphed the government, requesting that it issue a statement saying that the country's policy is not aimed at encircling Germany, nor does it intend to obstruct the legitimate activities of the German people, so as to avoid giving that country an excuse to engage in propaganda. (2) British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine also telegraphed, making some suggestions, stating that if the British government could issue a statement saying that it had no intention of organizing an "anti-dictatorial crusade," it would greatly facilitate diplomacy with Italy. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons today regarding the international situation were endorsed by the Government Party, which considered the wording to be extremely correct in the current circumstances. Even critics of Chamberlain within the Government Party considered the remarks to be firm and important. Several Labour MPs also expressed satisfaction today. Neither the Labour Party nor the Liberal Party questioned Chamberlain after his speech. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's editorial in the Italian Telegrafico news agency stated that if Britain wants to punish Germany, war is inevitable. If Britain only wants to create a security system to avoid future accidents, it should not insist on a policy of encirclement, but accept the clearing of past events. Italy desires peace and a peaceful resolution of all issues. In the future, Italy will have an important mission in the stability of the new Europe, but other countries should not repeat major mistakes, and should not think that Italy can be intimidated, expelled, or deceived. The newspaper mentioned France, saying that the bridges have not yet been burned, but the issues mentioned in the Italian note last December cannot be dealt with casually. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After Germany annexed the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of Czechoslovakia, political figures here recently declared that the U.S. action will be temporarily limited to not recognizing the de facto situation and imposing additional tariffs on German imports. It is still unknown what Britain and France intend to do to prevent future aggression by totalitarian states. Furthermore, diplomatic circles here believe that the negotiations conducted by Britain and France on the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe are extremely slow, only giving the Rome-Berlin axis opportunities to covet. Moreover, various European democracies have recently shown a willingness to reconcile with Italy, but they know that no matter what concessions they make, this reconciliation is likely to be futile and unsustainable. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin newspapers today called the three agreements that Germany signed yesterday with Lithuania, Slovakia, and Romania "clear evidence of the work of transforming Europe." The "Volkischer Beobachter" declared, "This is just a small part of the huge plan that the National Socialist Party began in early 1938 to transform Central and Southeastern Europe. However, such achievements in a short period of twelve months can be said to be unprecedented in history." (Haitong Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Swinemünde: The Führer, Hitler, returned to this question from the port of Memel at 9:15 this morning on the pocket battleship "Deutschland," and then transferred to a special train to return to Berlin. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The second 35,000-ton battleship is scheduled to be launched on the first of next month, and the ceremony will be presided over by Hitler. It has been named "Admiral Tirpitz." (It is noted that the first battleship was named "Bismarck." After the launching ceremony is completed), Hitler will go to Berchtesgaden for rest. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Propaganda Minister Goebbels may go to Italy for vacation, it is also uncertain. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The official draft of Hitler's speech in Memel released by the German News Agency tonight deleted the phrase "I believe that we have fully achieved this extraordinary ending of compensation." (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>French Worries</h3>
<p>(Paris) People here are already worried about the trade agreement signed between Germany and Romania. Although Romanian officials do not recognize that this agreement has placed Romanian interests under German control, and point out that other countries can also sign similar agreements with Romania, all sectors in France question whether Romania still has other interests. The French now hope that a British commercial delegation and British capital may offset this danger. Some well-informed people in France say that the Romanian trade agreement is only the first step in Germany's plan to expand its control over Romania, and fear that Lithuania will also follow suit. They believe that the best way to resist this action is for London to adopt a powerful Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, including other countries if possible, to resist German aggression, because the British stance against Hitler is the same as against Mussolini. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The international situation has developed in many directions in recent days. The most prominent examples are: Under the advocacy of Britain, peace-loving countries are discussing the issuance of a joint declaration; King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy delivered an important decree at the Fascist vocational group meeting yesterday; Germany signed agreements with Lithuania and the Slovak State, respectively, and also signed a commercial agreement with Romania; Hungarian troops entered the Slovak State; British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke in the House of Commons yesterday about the international situation. All of these are of great importance. In addition to reporting as much as possible, newspapers here are discussing them in various ways. For example, the right-wing "Echo de Paris" criticized the Soviet Union's actions and insisted that Britain and France should not cooperate with it. It said, "We must now choose between Moscow and Rome. Our extremists tend to the Soviet Union and clash with Italy, almost leading us astray on the path of ideological warfare. We must know that the result of the war, no matter who celebrates victory, will inevitably enhance the position of Soviet Marxism, which is unacceptable." The "Journal" published news from Berlin, stating that "Romania has abundant food and is rich in oil. This kind of resource has long been coveted by Germany. After Germany established a commercial agreement with Romania, its policy of subtle advancement has therefore gained a thicker foundation. As far as the agreement between Germany and Lithuania is concerned, it is the first step in Germany's strict control of Lithuania, and it is also a prelude to the conquest of other countries along the Baltic Sea." The right-wing "Petit Parisien" reported that "According to reports from Berlin diplomatic circles, the issue of the Free City of Danzig will be resolved within this historically significant month." The right-wing "Le Matin" commented on the Italian King's decree, saying, "Roman public opinion generally believes that the tone of the decree is mild, but Prime Minister Mussolini will also deliver a speech on the 26th of this month. In addition to extending the King's intentions, he will also explain Italy's willingness to wait for France to make some expressions. What is unknowable is how he will phrase it." The right-wing "Le Temps" reported, "Those in France who praised the Munich Agreement have already suffered tragically six months ago, and now they want to exclude the Soviet Union and obstruct its participation in the British plan. This is an even more serious mistake." The Radical Socialist "L'Œuvre" also commented on the Italian King's decree, saying, "Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver a speech on the 26th of this month. How he phrases it is a major mystery. Although we are still willing to negotiate with Italy, we must be careful not to fall into their trap." The Socialist "Le Populaire" commented on the British government's actions, saying, "Although we have no objection to Prime Minister Chamberlain, we are happy to praise Foreign Secretary Halifax. This man has courage, keen insight, and a calm mind. These strengths have been tested by the Czechoslovakian issue and are well-known. If world peace is ultimately preserved, the contribution of Foreign Secretary Halifax cannot be denied." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Poland Can Temporarily Live in Peace; Poland Still Decides to Strictly Adhere to Neutrality; Collective Security System in Eastern Europe Suffers Setback</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Poland has recalled some reserve soldiers and specialists from 1914 and 1925 to active duty. It is heard that this move aims to strengthen the defense of the northern land. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here recently declared that the current situation in the Free City of Danzig will not change. Although it has not been incorporated into German territory, Germans already enjoy various rights there. Although annexation by Germany would enhance its prestige, it could also cause disputes with Poland, which Germany does not want. The only question now is how to connect East Prussia with western Germany, which are separated by the Polish Corridor. This issue will be submitted for discussion before the end of this year, but a solution will be sought based on the spirit of the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, so as to avoid any adverse impact on relations between the two countries. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the issue of a collective security organization in Eastern Europe, the governments of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union planned to issue a joint declaration in the short term, but Poland does not want to participate in it. The twists and turns in this process are noteworthy. The content of this declaration was explained by British Ambassador Sir Kennard to Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, but Foreign Minister Beck considered the quality to be insufficient, meaning that the relevant countries must accept more concrete constraints politically, and especially militarily, for the declaration to be meaningful. In addition, the Romanian authorities have signed a supplementary commercial agreement with Germany. After this, the Romanian economy is actually controlled by Germany. Regarding this matter, the Polish authorities originally hoped that Britain could take some action to dispel this German attempt, but Britain did nothing. The Polish authorities' unwillingness to participate in the joint declaration is mainly due to these two reasons. In addition, after the Slovak State became a German protectorate and the Memel region was returned to Germany, Poland's situation became increasingly difficult. It had to find its own way to survive, and strictly adhere to neutrality between the anti-German group and the Berlin-Rome political axis. The Polish authorities also have the view that the Eastern European issue has already been satisfactorily resolved according to the will of German Führer Hitler. Germany may then turn to Western Europe to complete its plan. In this way, the Polish authorities believe that it is more advantageous to maintain their original diplomatic policy and maintain a detached attitude. This is another reason why Poland does not participate in the joint declaration. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The "Polish Gazette" (organ of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) published an editorial today explaining the country's diplomatic policy and commenting on the efforts of Western European countries to restore the balance of power in Central Europe, believing that cooperation with the Soviet Union is not a foolproof solution. It said: Poland will not participate in any group, nor will it initiate the organization of any group. Poland must firmly adhere to its own path, move forward, develop its strength, strengthen national defense, and promote its economy. Poland has no territorial demands at present, nor does it intend to place other countries under its protection to expand its influence, but the integrity of its territory must be respected, and the interests it holds in areas close to its borders must not be ignored or abandoned.

<h3>Germany and Japan Have Not Signed a Military Alliance: Berlin's Statement</h3>

<p>(Berlin) Germany signed a friendship treaty with "Manchukuo" on May 12 of last year. The German Minister to "Manchukuo," Mr. Wagner, signed a commercial agreement with the Prime Minister of "Manchukuo," Zhang Jinghui, in Changchun today, based on the most-favored-nation clause, in accordance with this treaty.

<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler, on board the destroyer "Leopard," departed from Memel Port at 4 PM today. Before his departure, he placed the port's artillery battery under the jurisdiction of the German Navy. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler signed the law merging the Memel Region with Germany on the battleship "Deutschland." The law stipulates that the Memel Region shall be under the jurisdiction of the East Prussia Province. German and Prussian laws shall take effect in the Memel Region from May 1st. Governor Koch of East Prussia Province is appointed as the temporary commissioner of the Memel Region, with Dr. Neumann, the leader of the Germans in the region, as the deputy commissioner. The law also stipulates that all Memel residents shall be German citizens from March 22, 1939. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) After the return of the Memel Autonomous Region to Germany, well-informed sources here commented that the impact on British commerce would be profound. In 1938, Lithuanian goods imported into the UK through Memel Port totaled £3,000,000, while British goods exported to Lithuania totaled £2,000,000. Now that Memel Port is controlled by Germany, trade between Britain and Lithuania will inevitably cease completely. Military experts stated that the British Isles rely heavily on the Baltic Sea countries and Denmark for food. With the Memel Autonomous Region under German control, Germany has gained a base in the Baltic Sea. In the event of war, it might further control Denmark and the Baltic Sea countries, which could interrupt the food supply to the United Kingdom, causing great concern. According to well-informed sources, the British government plans to purchase and stockpile a large amount of food in various locations to ensure security. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order today stating, "The commercial treaty between the United States and Czechoslovakia, although still valid, has been temporarily suspended because the country is currently occupied by German and Hungarian troops." The preferential tariff rates stipulated in this treaty shall be completely abolished from April 22nd. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters that the Lithuanian Minister had delivered a note to the State Department stating that the Memel Autonomous Region had been returned to Germany. The U.S. government regrets that it has no choice but to acknowledge this fait accompli. The State Department has forwarded this note to the Treasury Department, instructing customs authorities to levy additional taxes on goods from the Memel Region, treating them in the same manner as German imports.

<h3>German-Romanian Trade Agreement Signed: Romania Makes Significant Concessions; Germany to Assist in Developing Agriculture and Mining</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to news from the capital of Romania, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and Commerce Minister Bujoiu, together with German Minister Fabricius and Economic Ministry representative Walter, signed a commercial supplementary agreement today and issued a formal communiqué stating, "Romania's production volume must be increased. Once increased, it can find sales in neighboring countries, especially in Greater Germany. This has been agreed upon by the German and Romanian governments. Germany will use its resources to assist the Romanian government in agriculture and forestry, and sell appropriate industrial machinery to Romania. In short, both parties should systematically cooperate economically on a larger scale, taking into account Germany's import trade needs and Romania's potential for production development. In addition, the position of Romanian exports in other countries should also be considered." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital The German-Romanian economic agreement was signed here yesterday, stipulating that various plans will be implemented gradually over the years: (1) To revitalize various Romanian industries, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, and oil, Germany will purchase large quantities of various products. (2) Germany and Romania will jointly establish an oil company to develop Romania's oil resources. (3) Germany will regularly supply Romania with machinery and armaments for industrial and military improvements. (4) To open up transportation and improve transportation services. (5) Romania will designate a free zone in the port area to provide Germany with space to build warehouses, docks, and commercial agencies. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The main points of the commercial supplementary agreement recently signed between Germany and Romania are as follows: (1) Romania should maximize the development of agriculture, forestry, textiles, and the planting of oilseeds (especially soybeans). (2) Germany should sell mining machinery to Romania and establish joint ventures to mine copper in the Dobruja region, manganese in the Banat region, and aluminum in the Vatra Dornei and Borod districts. (3) Romania and Germany should jointly exploit oil and manage sales. (4) The Romanian army's military equipment should be supplied by Germany. (5) Once this agreement is ratified, the instruments of ratification should be exchanged as soon as possible in Berlin, and the agreement should be implemented one month later. (6) The agreement is valid until March 31, 1944. Either signatory country may announce its termination one year before the expiration date; otherwise, the term will be automatically extended. If either party wishes to announce termination after that, it must notify the other party three months in advance. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The German-Romanian trade agreement, signed today, is very broad in nature, with the development of Romania's potential resources, especially in agriculture, as its main feature. It is reported that Germany will provide its commercial experience for Romania's adoption and undertake to supply industrial necessities. Romania's productivity is expected to expand greatly. Attention will also be paid to forests. Germany will provide Romania with machinery and mining equipment and organize joint German-Romanian companies to mine oil, copper, chromium, and manganese. Iron ore and aluminum industries will also be established. In addition, the supply of military supplies for the Romanian army, navy, and air force, and the Romanian arms industry are also specified. After signing the agreement, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu stated that if other countries are willing, the Romanian government is also prepared to sign similar agreements. According to political circles in the Romanian capital, Romania still retains economic independence, but Romania has now agreed to a greater extent than it was originally willing to agree to. German sources refer to this agreement as a "German-Romanian Five-Year Plan." Germany has stated to Romania that the armaments and ammunition ordered by Romania from the Skoda factory in Bohemia before Germany occupied Czechoslovakia will be delivered on schedule. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital After the conclusion of the Romanian-German commercial supplementary agreement, Foreign Minister Gafencu gave a speech commenting that Romania loves peace and is willing to help the Danube region countries stabilize the situation, as can be seen from this move. In addition, the necessity of our country to develop trade with other countries has also been taken into consideration. We are now prepared to sign similar agreements with other countries, stating that the security of our borders and the independence of national sovereignty must be maintained. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital The Romanian-German commercial supplementary agreement was signed yesterday. In the opinion of political circles, everyone said that there is nothing alarming about this agreement. The newspapers mostly commented on Foreign Minister Gafencu's speech last night, viewing it as a necessary measure to consolidate peace and change the situation in Central Europe. However, some people also believe that the content of the agreement only formulates various principles, and there are still many problems with the technical details, which must be determined by other means. The only thing that can be asserted is that the Romanian government has never given Germany any exclusive rights. In addition, although the authorities are afraid that Britain and France will no longer be able to compete with Germany in Romanian trade in the future, political figures still hope that the two major democratic countries of Britain and France will adopt a positive attitude so that Romania can still maintain its economic independence. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital A large part of the Romanian population, especially Jewish business leaders, expressed unease about the new German-Romanian trade agreement. However, official circles stated that Romania's economic independence has not been impaired by this agreement. This agreement does not prevent Romania from concluding agreements with the same wording with other countries. The newspaper spoke according to the official intention, saying that now that economic compromise has been established, political tensions will inevitably ease. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Romanian trade ranks first in imports and exports to Germany, second in imports to Czechoslovakia, and third in exports. Therefore, in 1938, Germany accounted for 55% of Romania's total imports and 40% of total exports. Now that Czechoslovakia has been annexed by Germany, the economic relationship between Germany and Romania can be seen from this. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<h3>德與斯洛伐克　簽訂恊定　規定保護辦法</h3>
<h3>Germany and Slovakia Sign Agreement Stipulating Protection Measures</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Slovak Premier Tiso signed an agreement this afternoon placing Slovakia under German political and military protection. The full text consists of five articles: (1) The political independence and territorial integrity of Slovakia shall be protected by Germany. (2) Germany may construct fortifications and occupy, and exercise military sovereignty in all areas of western Slovakia located west of the Little Carpathian Mountains, the White Carpathian Mountains, and the Javorníky Mountains at any time. Existing fortifications in these areas shall be used by the German army. Supplies required by the German army shall be exempt from import duties. (3) The Slovak government may organize an army with the full consent of Germany. (4) Slovakia may send envoys to foreign countries, but shall pursue its foreign policy with the constant consent of the German government. (5) This agreement shall enter into force from the date of signature and shall be valid for a period of twenty-five years. Both parties may contact each other before the expiration date to extend it. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw The Polish Post has published a speech by Slovak Premier Tiso, stating that "Slovakia does not intend to join the League of Nations, and will not sign or participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact except to support it in spirit. In the future, Slovakia will establish embassies in the capitals of Germany, Italy, the United States, Poland, Hungary, and the Vatican, and may extend this to Paris later. The main responsibilities of these embassies are to handle commercial and cultural issues, and they will not be given diplomatic missions for the time being. As for the politics of this country, only one party will be allowed to form, and all ethnic minorities will be incorporated into it, but Jews will not be allowed to participate in any economic or cultural work."

<h3>法義談判　若接若離</h3>
<h3>Franco-Italian Negotiations: On and Off</h3>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers continue to carry news of the possibility of informal contacts between France and Italy. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy's speech today in the Fascist Corporate Council has been commented on by responsible persons here, saying that the French government is still prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy, but the status of Italian residents in French Tunisia, North Africa, must be based on what was stipulated in the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement. At this time, certain countries often use the fact that their own ethnic minorities reside in foreign places as an excuse to claim the necessity of annexing these places. If the French government grants autonomous rights to the Italian minority in Tunisia, it is not a safe way. In addition, according to the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement, France promised to cede certain places bordering Tunisia and Italian Libya, certain places bordering French Somaliland and Italian East Africa, and a certain small French island in the Red Sea to Italy. In the future, France's territorial concessions to Italy should still be limited to this. As for the management issue of the French commercial railway from the port of Djibouti in French Somaliland to Addis Ababa, it can be modified with reference to the current situation in East Africa. Certain conveniences can also be given to Italian commerce in the port of Djibouti. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

Slovakia has also notified Berlin of the Hungarian military action, but it is still unknown whether it has requested assistance. The Slovak army is currently resisting the Hungarian military attack, and small-scale battles have reportedly occurred, with casualties on both sides.

<p>Slovak Capital Hungarian troops entered Slovakia yesterday and occupied several towns. According to official sources here, Slovak Premier Tiso signed an agreement with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday placing Slovakia under German protection. Afterwards, the Hungarian government apologized to the Slovak authorities for sending troops into the country and stated that it had ordered these troops to withdraw completely within 24 hours. It is now known that Hungarian troops have indeed been successively leaving the country since this morning, and the two towns of Gelnica and Sobrance occupied by them have been taken over by Slovak troops. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Slovak Capital The Hungarian government has proposed to the Slovak government that a joint commission be organized to delineate the border between the two countries. This was discussed at today's Slovak cabinet meeting. The cabinet members unanimously agreed to reject it, saying that the borders of Slovakia are exactly the same as the borders of the Slovak province of the former Czech Republic, and there is no change, so there is no need to re-delineate it. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Prague Hungarian mechanized units, under the cover of tanks, entered Slovakia from the Carpathian Ruthenia province to a distance of 15 kilometers, occupying several villages and towns, shooting down one Slovak plane. A Hungarian officer also told Colonel Hudega, the commander of Slovakia, that the Hungarian army had obtained the consent of German Führer Hitler and therefore entered the country. The Slovak army, numbering about 2,000, retreated once and then launched a counterattack, making contact with the Hungarian army again. Certain sources here say that the Slovak army is weak and unable to stop the Hungarian army's advance, and Germany may need to intervene. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital According to an official announcement, the government has received a telegram from Slovak Foreign Minister Durčanský protesting the Hungarian military's entry into Slovakia. Foreign Minister Csáky replied immediately, promising to conduct an immediate investigation, and said that because the eastern border of Slovakia had not yet been delineated, disputes easily arose between military officers on both sides. It is not true that Hungary took military action after obtaining German consent. The official then issued a statement acknowledging that the Hungarian army had indeed occupied several places on the west bank of the Ing River. Hungary will form a joint committee with Slovakia to delineate the border. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Prague Hungarian troops entered Slovakia in three routes yesterday evening, and occupied Gelnica, Sodovce, and Vyšný Hrabovec before noon today. At 2 PM, they began to withdraw from Slovakia. Although a small number of troops had not yet withdrawn by the evening, the Slovak troops who had gone to the border to prepare for battle had been ordered to return to the base in Prešov, which shows that the matter has been resolved.

<h3>美購銀法　將予延長</h3>
<h3>U.S. Silver Purchase Act to Be Extended</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the current Silver Purchase Act, the President enjoys various privileges in silver purchase policy. This law will expire at the end of June this year. The Senate Silver Committee has submitted a draft to extend the validity of the Silver Purchase Act for discussion. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Eccles attended and gave a speech, criticizing the government's policy of purchasing foreign silver, saying, "The result of this policy is to weaken the domestic silver mines and increase the reserve of banks." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Finance Committee had asked many questions about the current monetary policy, requesting a response. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau sent a note to Senator Wagner, Chairman of the Committee, stating (1) The continued influx of large amounts of gold into the United States in recent months is very satisfactory. (2) The value of the U.S. dollar remains at the rate of $35 per ounce of gold. (3) Although the United States has as much as $15,000,000,000 in gold reserves, "due to unstable international political and economic conditions," the U.S. Treasury Department has no need to intervene to reduce gold reserves. (4) Opposing the restoration of the gold standard for two reasons: first, the U.S. dollar cannot be exchanged for cash, and second, the government has the power to control gold transactions and change the value of the U.S. dollar. As for the President's power to change the value of the U.S. dollar, this measure is sufficient to prevent speculation and should be maintained. In short, the global currency turmoil is not controlled by the United States. The only impact of this turmoil on the United States is that foreign gold comes in droves, proving the world's deep faith in the U.S. dollar, which no other currency can match. However, if too much gold flows in, the United States and the rest of the world will lose balance, which is what we are worried about. Fortunately, we have sufficient power to prevent major blows to the domestic currency system, and the President's power to change the value of the U.S. dollar has been very successful in stabilizing finance in the past.</p>

<h3>Spain: Civil War to End Imminently; Government Troops Have Surrendered Unconditionally; Nationalist Troops Prepare to Enter Madrid</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to the latest news from Burgos, the Spanish Nationalist troops will enter Madrid tomorrow. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Burgos Today, we received a broadcast from the Madrid United Money Radio Station saying that the surrender of Madrid is now not a matter of time, but a matter of seconds. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Yesterday, a civilian aircraft carrying five people flew to Burgos. Therefore, there was an announcement that the Spanish Nationalist troops will enter Madrid today. It is reported that two of them were members of the Madrid Defense Committee, two were personnel from the Nationalist military intelligence service, and the other was an officer of the Republican Air Force. After arriving in Burgos, the above five people immediately began negotiations for Madrid to surrender unconditionally immediately.

<h3>Ganzi, Xikang: Dajin Temple Case Resolved; Seven Articles of Resolution Signed</h3>
<p>Kangding News: The long-unresolved Dajin Temple case was resolved at the end of last year after the special commissioner Zhang Zhenzhong, dispatched by the former Xikang Provincial Construction Committee to mediate the Ganzi case, and Daiben Wangqing, the special representative dispatched by the Tibetan Kashag, together with Fan Changyuan, the director of Kang-Tibet negotiations, various representatives of Ganzi, and representatives of Dengke and Dajin Temple, held repeated meetings in Gengqing, Dege. After more than forty days, they finally agreed on the detailed</p>
<p>Seven articles of regulations for resettling good Dajin monks. After the closing ceremony, they were signed, and seven copies were written, all in both Chinese and Tibetan. The contents are roughly: (1) Repair Dajin Temple, (2) Zhuwo, Lin Chongjiao, and Laolong three villages are placed under the jurisdiction of the Ganzi County Government, (3) The temple monks will compensate 700 taels of silver for the goods robbed from Gan, (4) The Tibetan side will issue firearms to Dajin Temple, and the Tibetan side will recover all of them, (5) The temple monks will compensate 50 taels of silver for burning the Dengke County Government and various stockades, (6) The living Buddha who should be appointed by Dajin Temple must first notify the Kang Provincial Government of his name and obtain its consent before being appointed by Tibet, (7) The procedures for Dajin Temple and Dajin monks and other parties will be resolved in a legal manner after the monks return to the temple. These seven measures have been approved by the superiors of both parties, and the case</p>
<p>is thus resolved. Dajin Temple is located in Rongba Cha, Ganzi County, with magnificent construction. There are nearly 2,000 monks in the temple, belonging to the Yellow Sect, with seven great lamas. Important matters must be decided by the seven great lamas before they can be implemented. Among them, the most prestigious Zuo Tan Lama is selected as the Adu Buddha Duduo, who is in charge of all internal and external affairs of the entire temple and has the power to command all the lamas in the temple. Dajin Temple has abundant temple property, and there are full-time stewards, lamas, who operate in major markets in Kang and Tibet, dealing in furs, medicinal materials, and other industries, and providing loans to Manchu merchants to do business. Its wealth is greater than that of all temples in Kang. It is said that the</p>
<p>gold and silver stored can provide ten years of salary for the garrison troops in all of Kang. The occurrence of this tragic incident was initially due to the fact that Baili Tusi Deng Dejin complained to Dajin Temple about the robbery of food. The monks of Dajin Temple became angry at the merchants of Ganzi, and a conflict occurred between the two sides. Later, the Tibetan side also sent troops to join, and issued firearms to the temple monks, which led to the expansion of the situation and a bloody tragedy. It has not been resolved for several years, and the Dajin monks have endured the suffering of being displaced. The merchants of Ganzi often had concerns about their safety. Even Dege and the counties along the Jinsha River in between were also affected.</p>
<p>The long-standing case has now been resolved satisfactorily through the responsible officials and representatives of Kang and Tibet being open and honest with each other. In the future, the people of Gan and Jin may be able to abandon their old grievances and enhance their feelings. Luo Jiangce, the steward lama (known as Da Xiba in Kang dialect) stationed in Dajin Temple, recently paid a special visit to Chairman Liu to pay his respects. He expressed his deep gratitude to the government for resolving the Dajin case and allowing all the monks in the temple to avoid being displaced. He also expressed his determination to support Chairman Liu in building a new Xikang in the future. Although the reporter felt that Luo was not the official representative of Adu Buddha Duduo of Dajin Temple, but as a steward lama, he was able to</p>
<p>express gratitude to the authorities. He decided to meet him. At 12:00 noon on the 9th, he went to the Provincial Government with the translator Xi to visit him. On the way, he chatted with Xi and learned that he was from Ya'an. Xi was about 30 years old, dressed in Manchu clothes, and his family lived in the furnace. He had been working as a translator for many years because he was proficient in both Chinese and Tibetan languages. Lama Luo Jiangce lived upstairs in the Yang family's pot village. The pot village was in a small, secluded alley. As soon as he entered the door, he saw horse manure and dirt scattered in the courtyard. Xi led the way up the stairs and into a room on the east side. Luo was sitting cross-legged on a bed blanket. When he saw Yu and others arrive, he quickly stood up. Xi</p>
<p>immediately introduced them and told Luo in Tibetan the reporter's intention. Luo was very humble and immediately offered the reporter a large plate of yellow rock sugar and presented snuff to the translator. The snuff was contained in a box made of animal horn. The reporter picked a piece of rock sugar and put it in his mouth to dissolve it. Xi, the translator, pressed the snuff on his nostrils with his fingernails and inhaled it, because the people of Kang are very fond of snuff. The light in the room was very dim, and there was a Tibetan-style teapot on the brazier. However, it was quite peculiar. There were an abacus and other things on the table. The sound of gongs and drums from the next door was deafening, because the local lamas were performing Buddhist services. At this time, the reporter and Luo</p>
<p>began to talk, translated by the translator Xi. The reporter asked when he came to the furnace. He replied that he came here in July last year and had been here for more than six months. During the conversation, he frequently pressed snuff on his nostrils with his fingers and inhaled it. When asked whether the lama represented Adu Buddha Duduo of Dajin Temple to handle affairs in the furnace, he replied, "No, I am the steward lama. I am here to do business, not to represent. Now that the Dajin Temple case has been resolved peacefully, the authorities in the temple will soon send an official representative here to pay their respects to Chairman Liu and report on the progress." The temple had previously sent someone to send a</p>
<p>leopard skin to thank the government for resolving the case and instructed Yu to present it respectfully to Chairman Liu. Yu's visit to the chairman the other day was to pay his respects for this purpose. At this time, the sound of drums and gongs from the next door became more intense, and it was almost impossible to speak. When asked what the real reason for the Dajin Temple tragedy was, he replied, "It was actually caused by the Baili Tusi, which led to a misunderstanding and conflict with the Gan side, which led to its expansion." As he said this, he pointed to the plate and asked the reporter to eat sugar. Yu humbly thanked him. When asked how many casualties and losses the Dajin Temple monks and the Gan side suffered in the conflict, he replied, "More than 200 monks were killed or injured, and the loss of property in the temple was worth about 10,000 taels of silver." When asked how many lamas were in the temple, he replied, "About 1,900 people can be gathered at any given time, but there are not actually that many at ordinary times." When asked how the lamas felt about the resolution of this case, he replied, "Since this case has been smoothly resolved by both parties agreeing on an agreement, so as to avoid the displacement of the monks in our temple, I am very grateful to the Kang Provincial Government." Then he took his leave and left.</p>
<h3>Sacred Conscription: Chairman Chiang Issues Order to All Provinces Prohibiting Payment for Exemption</h3>
<p>Ningbo News: Chairman Chiang, considering that the method of paying for exemption from military service implemented in Zhejiang Province should not be established, specifically telegraphed all provincial military districts to inform them. The original telegram stated: "In a country with a conscription system, military service is sacred. Those who are liable for service are not allowed to pay for exemption, and those who are legally exempt should not be made to pay for exemption as an exception. This is one reason. The local administration and local autonomy in our country have not yet reached a perfect stage. If we implement an exceptional payment system, there will be a hundred harms and no benefits. This is the second reason. The preferential treatment of the families of fallen soldiers and the families of soldiers on expeditions is the duty of the state and must be borne by the state. It cannot be taken from a small number of legally exempt personnel. This is the third reason. Based on the above reasons, the method of paying for exemption from military service should not be established."</p>
<h3>Huangdu Train Station Attacked by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Fei Yiming's Sixth Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Army, stationed near Baihegang, after recovering Huangdu Town at the beginning of the month, many local strong men who had received military training and understood righteousness joined the army upon hearing the news, hence their momentum grew daily. On the 21st night, Commander Fei, together with Deng Jinglie's Chinese troops from Jiading, jointly attacked the Huangdu Train Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Only fifty or so Japanese soldiers were stationed at the station. Seeing that they were surrounded by guerrillas on all sides, they were at a loss, suffering over thirty casualties. Fei's troops blew up the foreign bridge No. 24 on the road, and a section of the track between Anting and Huangdu was also severely damaged. When the Japanese troops stationed at Nanxiang and Anting stations heard the news and rushed to the scene, the Chinese troops had already safely retreated.</p>

<h3>Food in Fujian Province Urgently Needs Regulation; Provincial Government Plans to Establish an Administration Bureau</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Sharply in Fuzhou and Quanzhou</p>
<p>Low Grain Prices Hurt Farmers in Eastern and Northern Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Food prices in Fujian Province have been rising in recent months. The price per dan in Fuzhou has risen to sixteen yuan, and in Quanzhou, it has risen to eighteen yuan, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. The reason for this is the difficulty in transporting grain from the rice-producing areas of eastern and northern Fujian. Rice from eastern Fujian used to be exported by sea, but due to the Japanese naval blockade, it is now transported by land, which has increased transportation costs and delayed the time. Rice from northern Fujian is transported down the Min River, but due to the drought and shallow water, boats have difficulty traveling, and very few arrive. Therefore, there is a large surplus of rice among the people in the producing areas of northeastern Fujian, with each dan only worth five or six yuan, which is about three times less than in Fuzhou and Quanzhou. This has a significant impact on</p>
<p>Rural Economic Circulation. Due to the abundant autumn harvest in Jiangxi Province last year, there was a large surplus. A special commissioner was sent to Fujian last month to discuss exchanging Jiangxi rice for sugar and salt from this province. The Fujian Provincial Government decided to purchase sixteen packages, but they have not yet arrived. Recently, in order to regulate the food supply during the war, a provincial food administration bureau has been established in Fuzhou, responsible for circulating grain among the counties and balancing prices, adopting a policy of official supervision and merchant management, and official-merchant cooperation, taking into account both the capital of merchants and the livelihood of the people. Efforts are being made to reduce and facilitate transportation taxes and valuation and licensing matters. Representatives of rice merchants have been convened for discussions once to discuss specific measures for implementation. As for the current</p>
<p>Temporary Solution, the provincial government has allocated 50,000 yuan to Quanzhou, entrusting local gentry and merchants to organize price stabilization. For Fuzhou, a batch of rice stockpiled in a certain area of northern Fujian will be transported for sale first. 16,000 packages have been arriving successively on the 15th and 16th, and rice prices are expected to fall within a day or two. Therefore, the food problem in this province is not as serious as reported outside. However, the coastal areas, such as the Pinghai and Puxi districts of Putian County, and the Gaoshan and Longtian districts of Fuqing County, suffered crop failures due to drought last summer, and the people have been unable to go out to sea to fish due to the war, and many are without food. Recently, the Provincial Relief Association has allocated one million yuan for relief, and plans to move some fishermen to the interior for reclamation. In addition, the rice prices in the Chaozhou and Shantou prefectures of Guangdong Province have risen due to a lack of supply. Since the counties of Zhangpu and Yunxiao in Fujian have abundant reserves, a special request has been made for</p>
<p>Transportation to Guangdong for Relief. The authorities are still considering it. As for the amount of summer crops harvested in this province last year, it is about 70% or more of the normal year. In addition, daily necessities such as sesame oil, soybean oil, and rapeseed oil have traditionally come from various ports in northern China, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Dalian, and Yingkou. Since the autumn, due to the Japanese control of oil exports, imports have sharply decreased, and prices have skyrocketed. The Provincial Agricultural Improvement Office promoted the planting of peanuts, soybeans, and rapeseed during the winter cultivation this year as raw materials for oil production, with great results. The office has now purchased new oil presses from Jiangxi and established factories in northern Fujian to achieve self-sufficiency. The remaining residue can also be used as fertilizer, which is a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Eight Counties in Northern Jiangsu Establish Joint Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Capture Huaian and Attack Shaobo</p>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: Considering that the Japanese army is invading south, and the counties in the Lixiahe region are important, and that close communication and convenient command are necessary to achieve success, the Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a meeting of eight counties in a certain county a few days ago. It was resolved to establish a joint defense headquarters for the eight counties of Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, Taixian, Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, and Funing. Commissioner Jin of the Sixth District was appointed by the provincial government as the commander, and Commissioner Chen of the Fifth District as the deputy commander. After receiving the appointment, Commissioners Jin and Chen have notified the counties by telegram and took office immediately. The headquarters is temporarily located in Yancheng. In addition to unifying the training of the local forces in the eight counties within the defense area, it also plans to mobilize the armed forces of the people of the eight counties to deal with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Chinese troops counterattacking Huaian arrived at the designated location on the 17th. At the same time, the troops of a certain army on the right wing advanced to the suburbs of Huaian and made contact with friendly forces. After actively counterattacking, they achieved successive victories. According to news from transportation circles here, Huaian was indeed recovered by the Chinese army on the morning of the 18th. A certain unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army in Shaobo at around 12 o'clock the night before. The Japanese army was panicked and fired artillery shells as a show of force, and fired machine guns aimlessly. By dawn, the Chinese army had safely returned to its original defense after achieving its mission. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses in ammunition.</p>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: At about 3:00 PM on the 15th, three Japanese heavy bombers flew from the coast to Yancheng, circled for several weeks, and dropped six bombs, all of which landed outside the northern suburbs, causing little damage. Then they flew towards Xinghua. The local air defense authorities heard the sound of the planes and issued an alarm. As a result, they did not pass through the county seat but went to Dongtai instead.</p>
<h3>Changshu After the Fall: Chinese Troops Active</h3>
<p>Constantly Controling the Northwest Countryside</p>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: The northwest countryside of Changshu has a wide area, neighboring Wuxi and Jiangyin, including the towns of Dahe, Wangzhuang, Dayiqiao, Xiaoyiqiao, Gangkou, Tianzhuang, Xixushi, Xitangqiao, Langanqiao, Xitangshi, Luyuan, Miaoqiao, Huangqiao, and Jinfeng, Donglai, Xigang, Donggang, Nanfeng, and Nanzhen in Shazhou City, District 7. Since Changshu fell on November 24, 1937, only the northwest countryside has always been completely under the control of guerrillas.</p>
<p>After the Fall, the guerrilla forces initially moving in the northwest countryside included the 5th, 6th, and 60th detachments of the Loyal Patriotic Army. Last summer was the most active period for the guerrillas. During this period and in this area, traitors had no place to stand. Although the puppet organization appointed puppet district chiefs for the 4th and 7th districts, they were unable to implement the decrees of the puppet organization. Qian Shuchen, the chief of the 4th district, was captured and shot by the Japanese army for assisting the guerrillas. After this, the puppet organization re-appointed Qu Huanru as the puppet district chief of the 4th district. Qu, fearing the guerrillas, set up the puppet 4th district office in Gangkou Town and dared not be blatant. Therefore, the puppet organization's administration of everything in the northwest countryside was always shelved. At that time, the Japanese army was also too busy to take care of it due to the tense war situation on the front line.</p>
<p>Repeated Contacts: It was not until after the fall of Wuhan that the Japanese and puppet forces in Changshu began to eliminate guerrilla forces in various parts of Changshu County and decided to "pacify" the east and "suppress" the west. The main force had several contacts in the area bordering Cheng and Yu, but the Japanese and puppet forces did not achieve complete victory. In October last year, in order to reorganize the administration of the occupied areas, the Jiangsu Provincial Government re-appointed Cai Runqi as the magistrate of Changshu County. Cai was a young soldier, shrewd and capable. After being appointed, he led about 1,500 soldiers of the Independent 2nd Detachment of the Jiangnan Advance Army of the Third War Area to Shazhou City in Changshu County, set up a county government office, promoted administration, and appointed district chiefs. The flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flew brightly over the northwest countryside. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet forces felt even more uneasy. They decided to adopt a meticulous and comprehensive encirclement strategy in two weeks, transferring Japanese troops from Wuxian, Wuxi, and Jiangyin, supplemented by a considerable number of puppet troops, to the northwest countryside, and stationed them in Luyuan Town in the 4th district. In order to avoid being surrounded, the Loyal Patriotic Army retreated to the Chengxi area. The county government also moved away from the Shazhou City area.</p>
<p>Puppet Retraction: In this scene, the most active in running errands for the puppet side were Qu Huanru and Wang Daohua. After the Japanese army stationed in Luyuan Town, they forced Qian Xianfu, a resident of the town, to serve as the puppet director of Luyuan Town. At the same time, they invited Qian Changshi to come forward and take charge. Before the Japanese army occupied Luyuan, Qian was the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Army. He fled once when the Japanese army arrived in the town. He was tempted by profit and heard that the Japanese and puppet forces were recruiting, so he became the commander of the puppet 4th District Self-Defense Force. However, his troops, which originally only had one company, were also handed over to the Japanese army for verification. After only a few days, a man named Pang Yun from Xitangqiao, who was originally a guerrilla captain under Yang Xingfang, was extremely angry at Qian Changshi's behavior. On the second day of last month, Pang secretly arrived at Xitangqiao, ascertained the location of Qian's troops. On this evening, Pang held a box gun in both hands and led three men in disguise, rushed to Qinjiadang. Qian Changshi was caught off guard and two light machine guns and nine rifles were seized on the spot. After this battle, the traitors began to retract slightly.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Active: Although the 5th and 6th detachments of the Loyal Patriotic Army, which had retreated to the vicinity of Yangshe in Jiangyin last year, had temporarily withdrawn, they were actively engaged at all times. A team of the 5th Detachment once sneaked into Donglai Town on the 3rd, killed a Japanese soldier with a box gun, and escaped with the gun in the hands of the Japanese soldier. Later, they all mobilized and opened up between the horns of Tianzhuang, Miaoqiao, and Xitangqiao via Langanqiao, etc., with about 1,200 people, complete with small cannons and light and heavy machine guns. As this team approached Luyuan, the Japanese army stationed in Luyuan was greatly alarmed and urgently asked the city for assistance. The entire 5th and 6th detachments opened up in front of Heyang Mountain between Tianzhuang and Xixushi, preparing to fight. At the same time, the Japanese army in the city and the Japanese army in Beiguo Luyuan also pressed closer and closer to Heyang Mountain. For a while, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of beads. The Loyal Patriotic Army charged bravely, killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers. After an hour of fierce fighting, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, and the guerrillas retreated in an orderly manner after achieving their mission. The Japanese army did not dare to pursue after suffering heavy losses. The Japanese army originally stationed in Luyuan secretly moved to Xitangqiao to prevent being attacked by the guerrillas again. Recently, the Japanese army stationed in various parts of the northwest countryside of Changshu included Luyuan, Donglai Town, Yaheqiao, Shiyixigang, and Beiguo, and the installation of telephone lines has been completed.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Arrives in Jinhua, Then Proceeds to the Front for Inspection</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondence: Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Commission, arrived in Zhejiang from Anhui on the morning of the 17th. The reporter paid a special visit at about 7 o'clock. According to him, his ancestral home is Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and he was born in Huaiyin, Jiangsu. This is his first time on his native soil, and he felt very gratified. As for the mission of coming here, it is to represent Minister Chen in attending the political work conference of a certain war zone, and to meet with Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province to discuss official business, and to go to the front line for inspection by the way. He left Chongqing on the 16th of last month, and it has been a month now. He stayed on the front line in southern Anhui for about two weeks, observing that the Japanese army's conspiracy is to consolidate the occupied areas, build bunkers, and use the flat ground and intersecting rivers to "clean up" our guerrilla forces. At the same time, they are strengthening their political and economic aggression steps to cooperate with their military actions, such as absorbing as much tea and rice from Anhui Province and silk from Jiangsu Province as possible, to exchange for foreign exchange, in order to realize their attempt to use our country's financial resources to kill our people. This is the new conspiracy of the Japanese after their failure to quickly resolve the war against us in the first phase of the war. In the future, their line of attack will probably focus on the northwest. However, our army is equipped with strong forces, and at the same time, it is limited by the natural danger of the Yellow River and the constraints of our troops in Hebei and Shanxi. Once they advance, replenishment will not be easy, and they dare not take this great risk. The date of my stay in Zhejiang will be decided after consulting with Chairman Huang by telegram, and I also plan to take the time to return to my ancestral home in Shaoxing for a visit. After finishing my work in Zhejiang, I will go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Xiong, and then return to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Xu Chunshan's Troops Revolt; Chinese Troops Capture Chongde; Japanese Squad Leader Killed</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: The Japanese army's Koizumi unit and the puppet pacification commanders Xu Pu cheng and Xu Chunshan's troops launched an attack on the new Chinese positions on March 16, encountering the mobile unit of Zhu Xi's Chinese troops in Xiaowu Town and Lutou. The Japanese vanguard was the puppet army of Xu Chunshan, but Xu Chunshan, knowing the great righteousness, feigned fighting against the Chinese army. Then, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness, he shouted, "We Chinese will turn our guns to fight the enemy," and immediately revolted, and together with the Chinese army, they successfully recovered key areas such as Xincheng, Lianshi, Chongde, Shiwan, and Tudian Temple. In this battle, more than 160 Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded. The Japanese squad leader Nakamura was killed on the spot, and a traitor named He was captured and has been executed.</p>

<h3>Xiang Army Tao Guang's Troops Rush to Defend Fuchun River Day and Night; Elite Fifth Division Arrives at Designated Location; Linshan Bombed; South Bank of Qiantang River Cleared</h3>
<p>Regarding the war in eastern Zhejiang, the Zhejiang merchants in this port are extremely concerned. According to correspondence from Hangzhou, more than 1,000 Japanese troops here, and about 2,000 Japanese soldiers newly transferred from Shanghai and other places, were transferred to Fuyang and other places starting from the afternoon of the 21st. More than 120 large and small motorboats manufactured by the puppet organization were also transported by the Japanese to the area along the river. According to reliable information, the Japanese troops transferred to Fuyang, at dawn on this day, took more than 20 motorboats and secretly crossed the Fuchun River, landing in ××× area. The Chinese army Liu Jianxu's troops immediately launched a fierce artillery attack, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle for three hours. Later, the Chinese army feigned defeat, and the Japanese army took advantage of the victory to penetrate deep, resulting in the temporary fall of ×××. After a certain Chinese officer had completed preparations for the rear road on the Japanese side, he launched a large-scale encirclement and gave a severe blow. At this time, the Japanese side knew that they had fallen into a trap, so they tried several times to break the encirclement and escape, but it was no longer possible. The Japanese warships that invaded Zhenhai are still gathered outside the port, and intermittently bombard the Chinese fortresses, but aimlessly, and the shells all fall into the wilderness, so the Chinese positions have not been damaged at all. As for the Japanese troops who invaded the south bank of the Qiantang River, some of them secretly crossed the river by motorboat under the cover of smoke bombs on the morning of the 20th, and most of them crossed the Qiantang River Bridge by setting up wooden boards. The Chinese army along the river heard the news and immediately concentrated firepower to bombard them, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers and destroying part of the bridge. Other Japanese troops who detoured by motorboat managed to land under the fire of planes and artillery. The Chinese army took advantage of the superior terrain to engage in a bloody battle with the Japanese army, and several times engaged in close combat. Finally, due to strategic considerations, the positions were slightly moved back. On this day, the Chinese army launched counterattacks on both the front and rear routes, and used the mountains to strike downward. Fierce battles have now broken out in areas such as the Liuhe Pagoda, and clear gunfire can be heard in the urban area, so the ordinary people and traitors are all panicked. It is also known that the Chinese troops in eastern Zhejiang have gathered in various key points, waiting to annihilate the Japanese, and the able-bodied young men in each defense area have completed their arming a few days ago, and have automatically asked the authorities to defend their homeland. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese side's attempt to invade eastern Zhejiang, in an attempt to open up the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and cut off the retreat of the Chinese troops in western Zhejiang and other places, will definitely fail.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Counterattack and Recover Shazhou</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Ningbo from relevant parties, the Japanese army secretly crossed the Fuchun River and landed in Shazhou, and was met with fierce resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese army was not stable on its feet and was annihilated in large numbers, but it continued to attack fiercely under the cover of Japanese warships. The Chinese army has transferred the Xiang army of Tao Guang's troops from the commander of the ×th Army Group to rush to the defense day and night. At the same time, the elite Fifth Division of the Central Army has also been urgently dispatched and arrived at the designated location. A certain unit of the Chinese army crossed the Fuchun River from a certain place at dawn on the 23rd and counterattacked Shazhou, charging fiercely. After a fierce battle until 2:00 PM, Dongzhou was captured, and the remnants fled towards Zhoujiapu and Lingjiaqiao.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Bombard Linshanwei</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM on the 21st, two Japanese warships sailed into the waters off Linshanwei, north of Yuyao, from Hangzhou Bay. At 12:10 PM, they suddenly opened fire and bombarded the coast near Linshanwei. The Chinese army did not return fire. The Japanese warships fired about twenty shells and then stopped. The shells all landed on the salt fields and in the wilderness, and at that time it was raining, which reduced their effectiveness, and there were no losses.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Carrier in Songmen Waters</h3>
<p>In recent days, the counties along the coast of eastern Zhejiang have been harassed by Japanese planes and warships, but the Chinese army's defenses are solid and have never succeeded. At noon on the 21st, a Japanese aircraft carrier arrived in the waters of Songmen, Wenzhou, seemingly intending to spy on eastern Zhejiang. The Chinese military authorities have been closely monitoring it, but the Japanese warship's movements are erratic and constantly moving. Its purpose is entirely to confuse the Chinese army's vision and disrupt the rear.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army and Air Force Mobilizing at Any Time</h3>
<p>It is also learned that the Chinese side was well prepared for the Japanese army's attempt to invade eastern Zhejiang. It is currently known that the number of troops stationed in various places is about one million, and the defense is extremely solid. The mechanized troops and mobile artillery units of Gu Zhutong, Commander of the Third War Area, have rushed to a certain place to stand by. Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of Zhejiang, is stationed in a certain place. At the same time, in addition to sending elite troops to defend, the central government has also transferred a large number of air forces to a certain place in western Zhejiang, ready to mobilize at any time to fight and sweep away the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou and Taizhou Announce Special Alert</h3>
<p>Xu Zongwu, Commander and Commissioner of Wenzhou and Taizhou, issued a notice stating that since the outbreak of the war, the maritime situation has been unstable, and Japanese warships have been patrolling and spying in the waters of Wenzhou from time to time. For the sake of pacifying the locality, he has obeyed orders and announced martial law. In accordance with the provisions of Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Martial Law Law, within the martial law area, any gatherings, associations, strikes, market strikes, and news, magazines, books, and various printed materials that are deemed to interfere with military affairs must be suppressed. He has recently issued a public notice, instructing all to be informed and not to violate it, lest they be arrested.</p>
<h3>Navigation and Transportation Not Obstructed</h3>
<p>The situation in eastern Zhejiang was once tense due to the harassment of Japanese warships, but yesterday, except for the fighting along the Fuchun River, the other places, such as Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Dinghai, and Xiangshan, were unusually calm. All foreign merchant ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo lines are still sailing as usual on the scheduled dates, so there is no obstruction in terms of transportation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo and Wenzhou Merchants Resume Purchasing Goods</h3>
<p>Since the situation in eastern Zhejiang became tense, the export trade in this city has also undergone drastic changes. Due to the difficulty of transportation on various routes after the war, and many have become occupied areas, the sales of goods have been greatly reduced. However, the passenger and cargo traffic to Ningbo and Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang has been active. Recently, due to the continuous bombardment of important towns on the coast of eastern Zhejiang by Japanese warships, many merchants in this port have received telegrams from merchants in Ningbo and Wenzhou to stop purchasing goods. For a time, the morale in the market was quite uneasy. It is now learned that the Ningbo and Wenzhou merchants have resumed purchasing goods since yesterday. Therefore, merchants are very eager to ship goods on ships sailing from Shanghai to these two ports.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Vague About Puppet Police Intruding on Concession</h3>
<p>Claiming "Puppets" are Auxiliary Personnel</p>
<p>Whether They Will be Employed in the Future is Undecided</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, protested to the Japanese authorities here because Chinese puppet constables were stationed on the bridges of the Public Concession, and the "Great Way" police were drilling in Hongkou Park. Placing these puppets from "Great Way" as sentries on the three bridges on the Suzhou River is an attempt to give these puppets "face." On the morning of Tuesday at 7 o'clock, puppets and Japanese sentries were stationed side by side at the bridgeheads, but four hours later,</p>
<p>They Were Removed Immediately. Whether this was the result of a protest by the authorities of the Public Concession, and the "Great Way" police held a drill in Hongkou Park last Saturday, was also strongly protested. When the Japanese spokesman met with reporters from various newspapers last night, he replied to questions and said that he did not know that the Municipal Council had protested to the leader of the Shanghai Consular Corps, and said that the Council had not protested to the Japanese diplomatic authorities. The embassy spokesman also said that the Chinese police involved in the Municipal Council's protest were used by the Japanese military authorities for police purposes,</p>
<p>Auxiliary Personnel. This is not an incident in which these Chinese police managed in the Public Concession. When asked if these "auxiliary personnel" would be allowed to wear uniforms similar to those worn by the puppet police of the "Great Way" in the future, the spokesman replied that he did not know the details. When asked if the Japanese army would re-employ puppet police, the spokesman replied that it depended on the need. When asked if the Japanese side employed them due to a lack of police force, the spokesman replied that there must be a practical reason for this move, which is not convenient to announce now. A reporter asked if this was done on instruction. The spokesman replied, "Yes."</p>
<h3>The Entire Baoshan County is a Scene of Devastation</h3>
<p>Appealing for Rescue Due to Excessive Disaster</p>
<p>The Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai stated that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Baoshan has borne the brunt, and all the fields, houses, and residences in the county have been destroyed. More than 180,000 people have been displaced, and more than 30,000 people are in the war zone, which is particularly pitiful. Now, the county is a scene of devastation, with people crying for food. Moreover, the autumn harvest last year has been exhausted, and they are bound to become starving corpses. Although the Shanghai Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly, the Red Swastika Society, and the association have tried to provide relief last winter, due to the excessive disaster, very few people have received relief. The association, feeling powerless and unable to save them, is specially appealing to all charitable circles in Shanghai. If those who are kind and enthusiastic to provide rescue, the association can assist in distributing the relief to ensure that the victims can benefit. Please contact the association at 12 Gongguan Road, 2nd Floor (telephone 85821).</p>
<h3>Stimson Strenuously Promotes Non-Cooperation Movement Against Japan</h3>
<p>Stimson's Telegram Replies to Important Groups in this City</p>
<p>Expressing Admiration for China's Loyal and Courageous Resistance</p>
<p>Because former US Secretary of State Stimson initiated the non-participation in the Japanese invasion committee, the important groups in this city telegraphed their congratulations. Now, Stimson's reply telegram is as follows: "I am gratified to learn of your telegram. I am deeply admired by the loyalty and courage of your country's military and civilians in resisting the war, as well as their firm belief in the final victory and world justice. We will make every effort to promote the non-cooperation movement against Japan, without interruption." Signed by Stimson.</p>
<h3>Deteriorating Situation in the Western District: Westerners Step Forward to Advocate</h3>
<p>First Meeting of the Western District Association</p>
<p>Discussing Issues Such as Police Affairs and Sanitation</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the Western District Association (outside the Public Concession), an organization formed by Westerners, held its first annual meeting last night (the 23rd). The chairman of the General Committee delivered an impromptu speech, highlighting several points, such as the deteriorating situation in the Western Shanghai residential area, the flourishing of gambling dens, and the proliferation of various crimes. Residents of the area are full of complaints and unable to find redress. During the meeting, a report was unanimously passed, approving a motion stating that the Association views the problems faced by the residents of the area with great concern, and requesting the committee to consider presenting resolutions to the upcoming taxpayers' meeting to address the following issues: (1) Adequate policing; (2) Sanitation, fire prevention, and other public health and public works matters; (3) Effective factory management; (4) Consultation and dialogue with any committees or other authorities appointed by the Municipal Council, to ensure proper management of the outer areas of Western Shanghai, with the participation of representatives from the Western District Association.</p>
<p>No Management in the Western District: The Chairman explained in his speech that we live in a relatively small area, including Shanghai, with no less than four different forms of management organizations, in fact, there are five. However, the areas currently not permitted for foreign residents can be temporarily disregarded. The Public Concession is managed by the Municipal Council, elected by taxpayers residing or having offices within its boundaries. The French Concession is managed by its Consul. The remaining areas, as well as the area west of the railway line (Hongqiao), are now nominally under Japanese management. From the western boundary of the Public Concession to the railway, and from Rockhill Road (transliteration) to the Suzhou Creek, is currently a shared area for anyone, although also within the defense zone of foreign troops, but the area lacks any centralized management and has no definite management organization. The worst aspect is that residents of the area have no say, pay taxes to the Municipal Council, but have no right to vote, no way to remedy existing problems, and no organization to express their opinions to the tax collectors. Although the tax collectors do not technically manage the area, they should certainly be responsible for ensuring that it is a healthy and legally habitable area.</p>
<p>Everything is Deteriorating: It is important to know that the general situation of the roads in the outer areas of the Western District is rapidly deteriorating. A year or two ago, the area was one of the most popular residential areas for middle and upper-class Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai. The few villages between the concession roads were orderly. Now, various forms of lawlessness and disorder are almost everywhere in the area. Traffic is congested on the roads, which are already unable to bear the heavy burden, leading to a state of disrepair. Sidewalks are obstructed by hawkers and food stalls, and mostly used as workplaces or markets. Small merchants and the poor are active everywhere. A large number of factories have been completed. Although factories may not actually endanger health, they are most opposed by residents and emit very unpleasant odors. The baking of rush mats along Rue Cardinal Mercier is one example. A large number of flimsy and unsanitary buildings have also been built. There is no doubt that these houses pose a fire hazard. Fire insurance premiums throughout the area have increased by 50%. Water supply is insufficient to cope with large fires. Although water consumption has greatly increased, water pipes have not increased simultaneously. The general water supply for application is actually insufficient.</p>
<p>Various Crimes are Rampant: Today, gambling dens are flourishing in the Western District, and various crimes are openly rampant, encouraged by people outside the boundaries who are not managed by the Municipal Council. The unsanitary conditions and overcrowding in various areas between the outer roads pose a great risk of spreading infectious diseases. The Municipal Council's Health Department has done much to improve the situation, but resources are insufficient and they have no power to take the severe measures that are truly needed. Members of the Association are familiar with these situations and understand the difficulties faced by the Municipal Council, as the Bureau must rely on the active assistance of the Consular Corps and military authorities. The committee has achieved much in curbing abuses and even preventing unpleasant factories and households. To achieve results, it is necessary to observe constantly and take immediate action. The Association now sincerely requests members to cooperate and report adverse conditions to the Association, so that it can negotiate with the parties concerned or relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Japanese to Open Qingdao Today: Sweet Words to Deceive People</h3>
<p>Claiming to Open the Yangtze River Based on This Principle</p>
<p>But When it Will be Opened Remains Uncertain</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy declared at a reception for reporters yesterday (the 23rd) that the Japanese authorities would allow foreign ships to berth along the wharves of Qingdao Outer Harbor from the 25th of this month. The news has been issued by the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, and a public notice has been issued stating that Qingdao is being reopened and hoping that third countries will understand the true intention of the Japanese government and cooperate in establishing the new order in East Asia that the Japanese government is now striving to pursue. The spokesman also said that, in line with the spirit expressed by the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao,</p>
<p>Reopening the Yangtze River is Another Matter: In response to inquiries, the spokesman said that the Yangtze River was closed due to military needs, which is well known, but it will eventually be reopened for foreign shipping. As for the opening date, it cannot be specified at this time. The spokesman continued to state that the reopening of Qingdao Outer Harbor to provide berthing facilities for foreign ships was based on the statement issued by the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao that, since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese government has expanded facilities to allow third countries to engage in peaceful</p>
<p>Commercial Activities: Although the results have been severely detrimental to Japanese military operations, this is a "well-known fact." In line with this policy, Qingdao Outer Harbor is being reopened for foreign merchant ships to enter and exit. Some say that closing the outer harbor and prohibiting merchant ships from entering and exiting is a discriminatory act or a closure of the "Open Door Policy," which is regrettable, as these restrictions are purely for military needs and in no way infringe upon the commercial rights of third countries or interfere with peaceful commerce. Therefore, the</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao hopes that third countries will understand the true intention of the Japanese government due to the reopening of Qingdao and assist in establishing a new order in East Asia. The reporters then questioned the spokesman about the points expressed in the above-mentioned public notice regarding the Japanese government's intentions. One reporter asked, "In view of the restrictions on the establishment of a new economy in North China before the reopening of Qingdao, under these circumstances, is the opening of great value?" The spokesman replied, "This can be found in the statement issued by the Consul-General in Qingdao." Some asked the spokesman whether the emotions expressed by the Consul-General in Qingdao could be used to explain whether the Yangtze River could be reopened.</p>
<p>The Spokesman Replied: "The Yangtze River is closed due to military needs, which you are familiar with." One reporter asked, "Does this mean that the Japanese authorities assume that the Yangtze River will eventually be reopened?" The spokesman replied, "Yes, the Yangtze River will be opened, but we cannot say when it will be opened." One reporter asked, "The Qingdao statement clearly states that the Japanese government hopes to satisfy the hopes of third countries. Will the same principle be applied to the issue of reopening the Yangtze River?" The spokesman replied, "The same spirit will be applied to all areas where restrictions have been lifted." Regarding the facilities that will be provided to</p>
<p>Foreign Merchant Ships in Qingdao after the issuance of the public notice, the Japanese authorities in this port were unable to provide detailed reports last night. However, it was learned from responsible parties last night that foreign ships will be able to berth on the fourth line of Pier No. 1, so this concession will be very important to foreign shipping companies. It is also heard that if the Japanese side believes that the military situation requires the closure of the wharves at any time, it will be closed without notice, and navigation will not be allowed at night. The full text of the regulations for the partial reopening of the Port of Qingdao has been notified by the Japanese Consul-General to the foreign consulates in the area.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Building: Yesterday's Security Was Tighter: This Measure is a Factual Necessity</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council building has been guarded by 40 members of the White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for many days without incident. However, yesterday morning, the security situation suddenly became tense. The main entrances of the Municipal Council Building on Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, which were usually wide open and freely accessible, were half-closed yesterday, leaving only one door open for entry and exit. Anyone with suspicious behavior was interrogated by members of the Volunteer Corps stationed there, to prevent unscrupulous elements from infiltrating and causing trouble. It is heard that the authorities consider this measure to be a factual necessity, but hope that all parties will not easily believe rumors and act rashly, and that the police will be cooperative.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Uprising of Puppet Police in Western Shanghai: Zhang Zhenwu and 25 Others Seize Two Handheld Machine Guns</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhenwu, Liu Dakui, Qian Gang, and 25 other puppet police stationed in Hejiajiao in Western Shanghai were originally police officers in the Beixinjing, Chengjiaqiao, and Caohejing police stations for many years. After the westward movement of the National Army, Zhang and others were scattered in the countryside. Later, due to livelihood issues, they temporarily joined the police bureau of the Dadao Municipal Government as puppet police in Western Shanghai, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to act. They have been empty-handed for more than ten months, and the Japanese have been monitoring them closely, leaving no opportunity to take advantage of. The other day, Zhang Zhenwu, together with Liu Dakui, Qian Gang, and 25 others, held a secret meeting, unanimously pledging allegiance to the Loyalty and National Salvation Army and vowing to serve loyally. They took a blood oath and appointed Zhang Zhenwu as their representative to contact Yao Youlian, the commander of the Second Brigade directly under the guerrilla leader, and agreed on a time and place to meet. At around 10 o'clock the night before last, Zhang Zhenwu and his group of 25 men sneaked out of Hejiajiao, seizing two handheld machine guns as a gift of entry. They were discovered by Japanese soldiers, who chased them to the vicinity of the Hongqiao International Cemetery. They were suddenly met by an ambush from both sides by troops dispatched by Brigade Commander Yao to the area. For a time, gunfire erupted and bullets rained down. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and retreated one after another. By the time the main force from Lincoln Road arrived, Brigade Commander Yao had already safely withdrawn.</p>

The US naval authorities in this port officially issued a press release yesterday (the 23rd), stating the scheduled itinerary of the various ships and explicitly stating that the various ships will sail to Qingdao and Yantai, which they have not visited for several years, so it is of great significance.

<h3>French Defense Commander Donates Funds to Refugee Children</h3>
<p>Children Write Portraits in Return</p>
<p>The French newspaper in Shanghai reported on the 24th that General Pléhédel, the French commander of the troops stationed in Shanghai, who is about to return home, recently visited the No. 1 Refugee Camp of the International Relief Committee on Route Massenet. When General Pléhédel arrived, he was properly received by the nuns of the Catholic Charity, the directors of the camp, and Madame Joet. General Pléhédel toured the schools, hospitals, and workshops in the camp and found the results satisfactory. It is also reported that when General Pléhédel left the camp, several refugee children specially used charcoal to quickly sketch the commander's portrait and present it to him, and General Pléhédel himself immediately signed a check, designating it to be given to the refugee children on Easter Sunday to improve their lives.</p>
<h3>Expanding Refugee Production: Forced Labor</h3>
<p>Regardless of Gender</p>
<p>All Must Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee, in view of the indefinite end to other matters, and in order to reduce the burden on the community, is implementing forced refugee labor, so that they can support themselves in the future with a skill. Yesterday, the committee convened a meeting, chaired by Li Guiyong, and decided on the following measures: (1) In order to enable refugees who are strong and capable of participating in production work to have widespread employment, the committee has specially formulated measures for the implementation of forced refugee labor; (2) All refugees in the three subordinate camps of the committee, except those who are disabled, sick, too old, or too young, must participate in work, regardless of gender; (3) The types of work shall be determined according to the existing work in each camp and the work obtained through contact with the outside world; (4) If it is confirmed that internal or external work is not suitable for participation due to actual circumstances, and the relevant personnel have investigated and confirmed it, participation may be temporarily suspended and further assignment of work awaited; (5) If the relevant personnel believe that a certain refugee has the ability to participate in a certain type of work among the internal and external work received by each camp, and the investigation is confirmed, and the refugee refuses to do so without a legitimate reason, the following penalties shall be imposed: First warning, second warning again, third expulsion from the camp; (6) These measures will be implemented from April of the 28th year of the Republic of China, and may be amended at any time if there are any incomplete matters.</p>
<p>Guangci Shelter</p>
<p>The Guangci No. 2 Shelter at 834 Wenlin Road in this port, that is, the Guangdong Refugee No. 2 Shelter, was previously organized by the YMCA. It was not until November last year that the Cilian Association took over and hired Liu Dingzhong as the director. There are now more than 2,000 refugees in the shelter, with adult men and women accounting for more than 70%. Among them, those with jobs account for 10%. Compared with the two numbers, there are still many unemployed. It is now heard that the director of the shelter is planning to do everything possible to implement a plan to make the best use of the talents of the refugees in the shelter, so that those with skills can have jobs. However, at present, due to economic constraints, it is necessary to start with simple and easy-to-implement things first. It is planned to organize a repair workshop for broken leather shoes in the shelter in the near future, selecting skilled craftsmen to take on the repair work, and setting aside a few refugee children to work as runners, responsible for pick-up and delivery. Just dial the telephone number "41806" to the shelter, and someone will immediately pick it up, and send it back immediately after it is done. Moreover, the leather and rubber soles used in the shelter are all high-quality goods, and the prices are low and the repairs are quick, so it can be said to be good value for money, and it is intended to find a way out for the refugees. It is believed that people in the community will sympathize and be happy to patronize. The opening date has not yet been set.</p>
<p>Prosthetic Limb Workshop</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, there were many wounded soldiers and refugees with amputated limbs, which was a tragic sight. The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross established a hospital for disabled soldiers and refugees on Route Paul Henry, and specially set up a prosthetic limb workshop to produce prosthetic limbs and prosthetic hands. The treatment of wounded soldiers reached 200 people, who were still able to walk and work, with remarkable results. At the end of October last year, the Red Cross stopped direct relief work, and the hospital for wounded soldiers was closed as well. However, the prosthetic limb workshop has been moved to the refugee department of Tongren Hospital at 37 Route Tenant de la Tour, and continues to work as usual. It is now known that all the work of the workshop is proceeding smoothly. Recently, two Jewish technicians have been hired to work together. All poor and unfortunate people with amputated limbs can contact the workshop for treatment, which can be provided free of</p>
<p>Charge. All matters are currently presided over by Dr. Shan Huiquan, an orthopedic expert at Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Shark Fins Should be Rejected</p>
<p>Since the Economy and Disaster Relief Committee advocated not using shark fins for banquets, it has been widely supported by all sectors of society. The committee has now sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Citizens' Association to promote it. The letter reads, "Our committee believes that shark fins are expensive and of poor quality. At a time when we are advocating economy, why bother tasting this delicacy? The committee issued a notice urging people to stop eating them, which has been approved and implemented by all sectors of society, which is deeply gratifying. However, in order to achieve universality, we rely on promotion. Therefore, we are forwarding this letter to your association, asking you to notify all members to share the difficult times, widely persuade them, and save this extravagant item for disaster relief needs, so as not to enjoy the taste of food but worry about public safety. A small intention, please support."</p>
<h3>Municipal Association Sends Letter to Hengye Company to Exempt from Rent Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to Hengye Real Estate Company yesterday, which reads, "Respectfully, according to a letter from the Twelfth District Branch of our association, member stores such as Aidu Pharmacy, Dahua Car Shop, Jiang Bingji Automotive Rubber Company, Dafeng Rongji, Yongxiangchun Tobacco Shop, Wanxingxiang, Lichang Coal Shop, Wantaiyu, Yuhang, Meifeng Boiler Iron Factory, Dabe Industrial Society, World Wireless Radio Service, Xinxing Teahouse, and Ruiyoutian have jointly stated that members have been renting houses from Hengye Real Estate Company for many years, paying rent on a monthly basis without arrears. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, members have been affected by business operations in countless ways. Recently, upon hearing of the recovery, they suddenly received a notice from Hengye Company that the rent would be increased by 16 yuan in national currency per building from May of this year. Members deeply feel that it is difficult to survive after the disaster, let alone bear this rent. Therefore, they specially ask your association to protect the citizens with all your strength, and request you to forward this matter to the landlord as soon as possible, cancel the rent increase, so as to alleviate their predicament and maintain their business. The association has received the letter with the above mentioned. According to this, it is found that in the current market, although some businesses have seen some loosening due to the sharp increase in population, most are still deeply affected by the wartime. The rent increase is really not the right time. Accordingly, we are forwarding this letter with the facts and circumstances, hoping that your company will be considerate of the difficulties of the merchants, and grant the approval to revoke the order. We look forward to hearing from you."</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Groups Request the Market to Mediate Rice Prices as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Frequent Disputes in Business Between Brokers</p>
<p>Many Complications in Agreed Rice Prices</p>
<p>Due to concerns about the rice market, the Shanghai Rice Grain Merchants Association, Changre Rice Industry Association, Nanbang Association Rice Transport Merchants Lianyi Association, and other four rice merchants and broker groups are jointly petitioning the Bean and Rice Industry Association of this city, requesting prompt improvements and the establishment of unified methods for compliance and implementation, in light of the following issues: (1) management, (2) broker transactions, (3) market price problems, and other business conflicts between brokers that are difficult to mediate as much as possible, leading to disputes in market transactions and delays. Furthermore, many complications arise in the agreed rice prices. However, the association has not yet responded to this request. Therefore, these broker groups have specifically scheduled a joint meeting for 11:30 a.m. tomorrow to appoint representatives to negotiate with the association in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>"Adoptive Grandfather" Yao Keming Forced Extortion, Woman Steals Property</h3>
<p>Stolen Property from Home Totals Over Fifty Thousand</p>
<p>Woman Li Zhiming Already Sent to Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Yao Now Hiding in Hongkou, Under Strict Wanted Notice</p>
<p>Li Zhiming, a Cantonese woman currently residing at No. 54, 1060 Avenue Edward VII, lives with her widowed mother, Li Zhao, and younger brother, Li Songjiang. The woman is already in her thirties and still unmarried. Because her mother is old and her brother is young, she manages the household affairs and most of the property. Her brother, Songjiang, was adopted according to Shanghai customs by Yao Keming when he was young. Yao used his status as an adoptive grandfather to enter and leave the Li family and even manage household affairs, which brought him closer to Zhiming. Recently, Li Songjiang discovered that tens of thousands of gold in stocks, passbooks, jewelry, and other valuables in his home had been gradually taken by his sister, Li Zhiming, and Yao Keming, either through sales or fraudulent withdrawals. He immediately reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest and detain Li Zhiming to investigate the type and exact amount of stolen property, and to secretly apprehend Yao Keming for punishment. After a week of investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the city case, it was learned that Yao Keming is now hiding in Hongkou, a special area that is currently difficult to access, so Yao is still temporarily at large. As for the property that Li stole and gave to Yao, the following items have been confirmed: (1) Valuable jewelry worth 9,300 yuan, (2) Shanghai Bank deposit, based on evidence, Yao withdrew all deposits and interest totaling 28,200 yuan in July of the 25th year, (3) Public Bus Company stock, Yao entrusted a foreign merchant at 267 Jiangxi Road to resell to Zhu and two others in January of the 24th year, for a price of 9,100 yuan, (4) A fire insurance policy for the Jiangwan house insured with Tianyi Insurance Company. When the house was burned down, the compensation of over 8,700 yuan was completely withdrawn by Yao in August of last year. The above four items total 55,372.42 yuan. In addition, the passbook with over 28,000 yuan deposited in the World Book Company is also in Yao's possession. It is presumed that the deposit period has not yet expired, so it has not been withdrawn, but the monthly interest is also taken by Yao and Li in turns. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Li Zhiming to the First Special District Court, where Judge Meng interrogated her. Police Attorney Qian Jiu first stated the case of prosecuting Li Zhiming for embezzlement and then gave a detailed account of the police's investigation. Finally, he requested a postponement of the case because it was still necessary to investigate and retrieve the stolen goods, and requested a wanted notice for Yao, stating that Yao was hiding in Hongkou and it might be difficult to apprehend him temporarily. During the court's questioning of Li Zhiming, she admitted to stealing various properties and giving them to Yao and claimed that Yao would resort to violence if she did not comply, but she denied having any other relationship with Yao. Judge Meng then approved the police's request, remanded the defendant in custody, and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Cotton Sold to British-owned Textile Mills Is Detained</h3>
<p>Gate North Fake Police</p>
<p>Extortion Fails</p>
<p>Express News Agency, local dispatch: The transportation merchant Ji Shi Ji recently loaded a large batch of cotton near Ningbo, totaling 1,737 bales, each worth over 400 yuan, amounting to over 700,000 yuan. They were transported to Shanghai by Fusheng, Deping, Ende, Kelan, and others and sold to British-owned textile mills such as Tongyi and Chongxin in this city. They used civilian boats to transport and load the goods, with three boats from Hesheng and two boats from Zhida delivering them to the factories. Unexpectedly, the five boats of cotton, when passing through the Xinzha Bridge section of the Suzhou River, were detained by the fake organization "Police Branch of Gate North" after their extortion attempt failed. Despite repeated negotiations by the boatmen, the boats were not released. Moreover, the cotton on the cargo ships was arbitrarily moved by workers to empty rooms in the former Four Banks Warehouse on the north bank of the Suzhou River, in an attempt to embezzle the goods. The British merchants are greatly angered and have requested the British consulate to protest to the Japanese side, demanding the return of the cotton. Meanwhile, the persons in charge of the textile mills have repeatedly negotiated, but no results have been achieved so far.</p>
<h3>Killed Due to Adultery</h3>
<p>"News Vendor Leader Killed</p>
<p>Five Murderers Have Been Sent to Court</p>
<p>Instigator 'Little Hubei' Is on the Run"</p>
<p>News vendor Wu Guisheng and a fellow vendor nicknamed "Little Hubei" had a feud due to business competition. Recently, a woman whom Little Hubei was in love with suddenly became intimate with Wu, which deepened the enmity to the point of irreconcilability. Wu originally lived in Room 36, Runhua Hotel, Lane 604, Fuzhou Road. On the evening of the 21st of the month, when Wu left the hotel, several thugs who were lying in wait in the lane surrounded Wu and used sharp blades to slash at Wu's buttocks, causing serious injuries. These people, seeing their objective achieved, dispersed in a rush. Wu did not report to the police station but went directly to the Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital notified the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Xue Youwen and Detective Chen Ruisheng to investigate. However, Wu refused to reveal the full truth. It was not until yesterday that Detectives Xue and Chen learned that the assailants were hiding at No. 22, Lane 357, Tianjin Road. They arrested Xu Asi (also known as Xiao Asi), Li Damao, Liu Bingqing (also known as Xiao Sichuan), Wang Xiaomao (nicknamed Cigarette Butt), and Yan Bingfu, but Little Hubei was on the run. Wu Guisheng died of his injuries at 11:00 p.m. last night. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Ru Baoyi briefly described the incident, stating that Wu Guisheng's body needed to be examined by the court's inspection department, and therefore requested permission to detain them. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Embezzled Funds All Sent to Shanghai West Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Chen Zhongwen, Wen Ziyao, and Gu Jinxian from Pudong each invested 2,000 gold in November of last year to operate a rice business. Chen and Wen were specifically assigned to collect rice in Qingpu, while Gu was responsible for sales in Shanghai. All the accounts were collected by Gu and then transferred to Chen and Wen for purchasing rice. To date, the business has reached over 20,000 yuan. However, recently Gu suddenly disappeared. After investigation by Chen and others, they learned that Gu had collected 4,100 yuan from Yang Jiuji at No. 145 Zhejiang Road and 1,500 yuan from Zhuang Zhilin at No. 9 Yude Lane, Guangxi Road, but did not hand them over, embezzling them for his own use. They then investigated Gu's whereabouts and finally arrested him in the French Concession on Shan Zhong Road yesterday and brought him to the French Police Station. As the crime occurred within the jurisdiction of the Lao Zha Police Station, he was transferred to the Lao Zha Police Station for handling. After questioning by Chinese Detective Xue Youwen, Gu confessed that the collected funds had all been lost in the Rongsheng Company gambling dens in western Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Ru Baoyi stated that it was still necessary to investigate the whereabouts of the embezzled funds and therefore requested permission to postpone the hearing. After questioning Gu, Judge Zhong Qing ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Squad Executes Drug Trafficker</h3>
<p>Chen Shanqing, a rascal from Caohejing, stayed in the town after the National Army moved west, stealing for a living. Later, he served as a cook for the Japanese troops. Recently, he has been selling drugs, specializing in sales in the villages of western Shanghai, making a huge profit. At around 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Chen left home intending to go to Xinzhuang Town. When he reached the vicinity of Huacun Temple, he was suddenly stopped by a sentry from the guerrilla squad. Chen panicked and fled, and the sentry opened fire, hitting him in the head and killing him on the spot. It is said that the deceased was 45 years old and had a wife and concubine.</p>
<h3>The Handgun Used to Murder Chen Tingsheng Was Involved in Sixteen Bloodshed Cases, and Eight Other Attempted Murders</h3>
<p>Chen Tingsheng, a native of Zhenjiang residing at No. 39 Haige Lane, Haige Road, was assassinated by his mistress Wang Guizhen and her lover Tao Boqing (also known as Pockmarked Boqing) in collusion with four others. The French police station solved the case the following day. The two shameless men and women, Wang and Tao, confessed to the joint conspiracy in court and stated that the four fugitives, Xing Ali, Jin Yufa, Wang Liansheng, and Cao Jinfa, had carried out the act. It is now known that after Chen was killed, the police station seized the bullet casings used to kill Chen. After studying them, the police have now found out that the handgun used for the bullet casings has been used by bandits in the city on multiple occasions. The gun has been used 24 times in total, resulting in 16 fatalities and bloodshed cases, as well as eight attempted assassinations. Therefore, the police station is now stepping up its investigation.</p>
<h3>Pan Sansheng Gained Ill-Gotten Wealth, Suddenly Visited by Robbers, Three Criminals Arrested and Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wang Jie (also known as the female owner of Wang Ji Photo Studio), a woman from Wuxi, is now 30 years old. She is skilled in Kunqu and Peking opera. She once married a certain Tongli, so news of Mrs. Qin's frequent appearances on stage was often seen in the newspapers. Wang requested to leave and then married Pan Sansheng. Pan is the owner of the Yangtze River "Inland River Shipping Company" and the "Asia Club" (casino). He built a huge mansion at No. 10, Lane 126, Kaina Road in western Shanghai. As the various businesses he operates are well-suited for this extraordinary period, he has profited handsomely, making him coveted by petty criminals. It is recently learned that Pan also took the opportunity to ingratiate himself with a certain party, released a certain guerrilla leader, and received a reward of 200,000 yuan. Thus, on January 27th of this year at 10:15 a.m., several robbers armed with weapons, holding cakes and oranges, used the excuse of delivering gifts to swindle open the door of Pan's house and rushed in. At that time, Pan and his wife Wang Jie were sound asleep in bed. Suddenly awakened from their dreams, they were threatened with guns and forbidden to make any noise. The robbers obtained the keys, opened both large and small iron boxes, and robbed them of 22,850 yuan in cash, 700 Japanese yen, as well as valuable jewelry such as gold and silver ornaments and jewelry, before leaving after about an hour. Later, the Chinese detectives Pi Bingzhang and Wu Changli of the Xinzha Police Station arrested the robbers Li Yutang (also known as Lin Gen), Zhang Yixian, and Tang Abao, all from Dachang, as well as seizing three Mauser pistols, one handgun, 39 rounds of ammunition, a Yong'an Company deposit book with 200 yuan, and jewelry and Qian Duo. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now learned that the detectives handling the case found that Li and the other three criminals were also involved in the robbery of the finances of Tiao Qing's family at No. 10, Lane 51, Xin Tangjia Lane on the evening of the 27th of last month, amounting to 1,500 yuan. Yesterday morning, Li, Zhang, and Tang were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan stood up and detailed the above situation, stating that in addition to the two robbery cases in the concession, the defendants also committed two robbery cases in the French Concession. Although the French police station has sent personnel to retrieve them, they have not yet provided official documents, and this case has not yet been concluded, so they should be ordered to be transferred to the next case. The court approved the request. Then, the victims Pan Wang (i.e., Wang Jie) and Lu Tiaoqing came to the court to testify about the robbery. Wang specifically pointed out that Li and Tang were present at the scene at the time. When questioned, the defendants all admitted that they had only robbed Pan's family of 5,000 yuan in cash, one gold ring, and two watches. They divided the loot into eight shares, each share worth 700 yuan. Tang Abao received three shares because he had two handguns. Li Yutang and the fugitives Wang Gengsheng, Ma Shunsheng, Gu Agen, and Wang's informant each received one share.

<h3>The Chinese Army Special Operations Team Again Warns Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Delivered Personally by Members of the Special Operations Team</p>
<p>Gamblers Trembled with Fear</p>
<p>It is known that the opium dens and gambling dens in the extraterritorial area of ​​western Shanghai have been repeatedly warned by the Chinese Army Special Operations Team in the past, ordering them to automatically close down by a certain date, otherwise they will be severely punished. However, these people were so frantic and contemptuous of the law that they remained the same as before. After the Chinese Army Special Operations Team learned of this situation, they felt extremely pained. On the day before yesterday (the 22nd), they issued a final warning to each den and paid more attention to several dens with the most prevalent gambling, such as Hollywood. It is known that the final warning was personally delivered by members of the Special Operations Team. The gambling dens were panicked after receiving it, especially Hollywood. According to eyewitnesses, after Hollywood received the warning at around 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, they thought that a large army would attack immediately, so they were terrified and immediately frantically knocked on the secret alarm they had set up. All the rascals and coolies in the den were immediately armed with weapons and ambushed at each entrance and exit, and ordered all the male and female gamblers not to act arbitrarily. All the gambling tables were stopped immediately. At that time, the general gamblers wanted to escape but could not, and asked to leave but could not. They were all trembling with fear. More than ten minutes later, seeing that there was no urgent movement after the Special Operations Team members delivered the warning, they resumed gambling as before. However, the general gamblers have already been terrified and scattered. In recent days, they are even more afraid of the decisive action of the Special Operations Team, so gamblers have stopped moving forward. The period of suppression is not far away.</p>
<h3>Huge Fire at Huangpu Wharf, Carelessness at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company Warehouse, Still Burning Fiercely This Morning</h3>
<p>The Huangpu Wharf on Huangpu Road north of the Suzhou River at the Outer Baidu Bridge, commonly known as the Japanese Mail Steamship Company Wharf, is located opposite the Japanese Consulate. At around 11:00 p.m. last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouse next to the wharf. For a time, the flames were soaring, and the red light filled the sky. Even from a distance of several miles, it could be seen. The intensity of the fire can be imagined. However, because the area is a Japanese gathering area and a guarded area, it is impossible to investigate the cause. After receiving the alarm, the Central Fire Brigade of the Public Concession dispatched four fire trucks to put out the fire, but it was difficult to extinguish the fire. It is said that the goods in the warehouse were all combustible materials, so it was difficult to put out the fire. Until about 1:30 a.m., the fire subsided slightly, but soon it flared up again. At the time the reporter sent the manuscript, it was still burning fiercely. Other details will be reported later.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Carrying Opium</h3>
<p>Zhu Baolin from Shichang was carrying 15 taels of opium at 10:10 a.m. the day before yesterday and took a Route 2 public bus from Caojiadu to Beller Road in the French Concession. The bus passed the intersection of Haig Road and Foch Road when he was suddenly searched by Chinese constables No. 2524 and others who boarded the bus. Zhu was arrested and the opium was confiscated and taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Court. After questioning by Judge Liu, he was ordered to be remanded in custody and sentenced on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Situation After the Establishment of the Refugee Cooperative</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Yuan of Cooperative Shares Have Been Recognized</p>
<p>The Current Focus of the Cooperative Affairs Is on Design</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Production and Consumption Limited Huangren Cooperative reported that since the company held its first board meeting on March 1st and announced its establishment, two weeks have passed in an instant. According to the original planned outline, business operations should have started immediately. However, the total amount of cooperative shares tentatively set by the company is 10,000 yuan, with 5,000 yuan used for production business and 5,000 yuan used for consumption business. Currently, about 2,000 yuan of cooperative shares have been recognized, and 8,000 yuan are still to be recognized. If it is an ordinary company, it cannot hold an inaugural meeting in accordance with the law until the shares are fully subscribed. However, the cooperative does not have this restriction. As long as there are more than seven people, it can be established. The founders can convene an inaugural meeting, pass the articles of association, elect directors and supervisors, and organize the board of directors for the registration of establishment. Therefore, to facilitate the process, the company was established as scheduled according to the original plan without waiting for the cooperative shares to be fully subscribed. On the one hand, the company still invites all parties to join, and on the other hand, it starts business operations. However, with only 2,000 yuan of recognized cooperative shares, it can only start with a small scale. In the future, as cooperative shares continue to be recognized, business will gradually be promoted. Once some achievements are made, large-scale expansion can still be carried out. The government strongly promotes cooperative undertakings. In October of last year, the Organization of the China Cooperative Association was initiated by the Westerner Ellie and subsidized by the Executive Yuan. The company can also request the government to provide hierarchical funds. However, it must first request the assistance of various Shanghai charities. Currently, the Zhen, Danjin, Liyang, and Five Counties Association of Natives in Shanghai have recognized 1,000 yuan of cooperative shares. Although the others have expressed their approval, they have not joined the company due to financial difficulties or other reasons. The company plans to ask them to quickly recognize the shares to facilitate the process. As for the company's address, it is currently temporarily borrowed from the office of the Zhen, Danjin, Liyang, and Five Counties Relief Association as a temporary location. It can only find another address after more cooperative shares have been recognized. As for the internal organization, the board of directors has held a meeting once and elected executive directors and chairman, while the board of supervisors has not yet held a meeting, so the chairman of the board of supervisors has not yet been elected. It is planned to ask the supervisors present to hold a meeting today. The executive directors have held two meetings and appointed several cadres, all of whom are temporarily unpaid, but they cannot be allowed to work for the company hungry, so food is also provided. Once the company's business is more developed, it will be designed. It is planned to invite people from all walks of life to be design committee members for the company in order to gather ideas and benefit. This is the general situation of the company after its establishment.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teacher Xie Xiangsheng's Two Cases Combined: Seducing Women and Embezzling Deposits, One Already Tried and One on Appeal</h3>
<p>Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Changzhou, is 39 years old this year. He was previously a class teacher in the Lagena Elementary School established by the French Municipal Council on Lagena Road in the French Concession. In early April of the 26th year, he advertised for female teaching assistants. At that time, Wang Wu, the mother of Wang Jie from Liuhe, who was 20 years old at the time and only 18 years and 4 months in actual age, was beautiful and had graduated from a high school in the countryside. She wanted to pursue further education but was unable to transfer schools due to her family's financial situation. She came to Shanghai and lived with her aunt at No. 9 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, wanting to find a part-time job to pursue further education. She saw the advertisement for female teaching assistants in the newspaper and immediately sent a letter of application. The next day, Wang Jie received a letter signed by Ding Jieshen, asking Wang to go to No. 14, Jiyi Lane, Pobei Road, to meet with Xie to discuss the matter. She was approved for employment, and it was agreed that the monthly salary would be 15 yuan. Wang was ordered to work at Xie's residence at No. 14, Jiyi Lane, specializing in reviewing elementary school students' papers. Wang went on April 26th and officially took office. Xie and Wang gradually became familiar with each other. At 4:00 p.m. on May 16th, Xie returned to his residence from school and raped Wang Jie using violent means. Later, Xie claimed that his parents had left and promised to formally marry her, etc., to deceive her. The woman lived at Xie's place and continued to have sex more than ten times. After about three or four months, the woman fell ill due to physical abuse. Xie unexpectedly turned into a hideous face and issued an order to evict her, driving the woman out. Wang was unaware, so she was deceived and lost her virginity and had no power to negotiate with Xie. Therefore, Wang Wu, the woman's mother, as the legal representative, hired attorney Qian Yuan to file a private prosecution for obstructing public morals and family in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Xie Xiangsheng, and attached a civil suit, requesting to recover compensation for mental distress, living expenses, etc., totaling 8,000 yuan. The defendant, Xie Xiangsheng, also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The initial trial resulted in a judgment that Xie Xiangsheng and Wang Wu were both innocent, Wang Jie's private prosecution was not accepted, and the attached civil suit was rejected. The plaintiffs, Wang Wu and Wang Jie, mother and daughter, were dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the defendant, Xie Xiangsheng, was relevant after the incident occurred, and concerned the reputation of the school, the school fired him, causing his address to change and making it impossible to deliver the summons, resulting in the appeal being suspended. The case was shelved. Then, after the outbreak of the war two years ago, Xie Xiangsheng took advantage of the extraordinary period and set up an employment agency on the Youth Association Building at No. 132 Yuanmingyuan Road in the Public Concession last year. The inside story was mainly to introduce marriages, and he turned to defrauding the employees and registered person's deposits for his own use. The Public Police Station learned about it and sent detectives to search and report it, and arrested Xie and sent him to the First Special Court.</p>
<p>The result of the trial was that Xie was found not guilty and released due to insufficient evidence of the crime. Xie did not change his ways and continued as before. Later, the victims collected evidence and reported to the First Special Court. After trial by Judge Feng Shide, Xie Xiangsheng was convicted of embezzlement in business and sentenced to one year in prison and remanded in custody for appeal. Xie was not satisfied with the judgment and decided to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. During the investigation period, the case was scheduled for retrial on the 3rd of next month. Now, because the Third Branch of the High Court has learned about the previous case, it prepared a document and dispatched personnel to the Second Branch of the High Court to transfer Xie to the court.</p>
<p>The trial was scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. However, the appellant Wang Jie has joined the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army after the outbreak of the war, and her mother, Wang Wu, has also returned to her hometown, making it impossible to contact them. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Court President Wu Tingqi and Judges Wang Yue and Chen Daqi opened a collegial panel for the trial. Attorney Qian Yuan, the agent of the appellant, arrived on behalf of the appellant, stated the reasons for the appeal, and then questioned Xie Xiangsheng, who talked eloquently and admitted that he had a relationship with Ms. Wang, but that it was a consensual matter and there was no use of violence, coercion, or seduction. Later, the woman asked me for 300 yuan, but I was unable to pay it, which led to litigation, etc. After verifying the confession in court, it was announced that the debate was over, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 31st. Xie was still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Spring Snow This Morning</h3>
<p>The local weather suddenly turned severely cold from midnight the day before yesterday, with fierce north winds howling like mid-winter. Until 9:00 p.m. yesterday, there was light rain, the wind subsided slightly, and the climate seemed to be turning better from hardship. Unexpectedly, at about 1:40 a.m. this morning, spring snow fell, with large snowflakes falling densely. In an instant, the roof tiles were all white, which will have a great impact on agricultural production.</p>
<h3>Summer Uniforms of Chinese Constables in the Public Concession Change Color</h3>
<p>The summer uniforms of the Chinese constables in the Public Concession have always been dark blue. This year, new tea-brown uniforms will be worn. The upper body of the uniform has a high collar and black buttons, with two pockets on the chest. The trousers are short, and the hat is still the same as before. The blue cloth leggings will also not be changed. It is said that the new uniform is more comfortable than the old one, and the material is quite good, enough to resist the heat. As for the uniforms of the Western constables and Indian constables, they will remain the same as before and will not be changed.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Gambling Den: Tea Boy Convicted of Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Ma Zhongliang, a tea boy from the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road, was found with a package of opium the other day. He was apprehended by the French police en route and taken to the Second Special Court's criminal division. He was sentenced to a fine of eighty yuan as a warning.</p>
<p>Physicians Registered with the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The register of physicians, dentists, and veterinarians for this year, compiled by the Public Works Department, has now been published. The contents are divided into five sections: (1) 1,225 practicing physicians, (2) 330 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, (3) 3 Indian doctors, (4) 201 dentists, and (5) 22 veterinarians. In addition, it includes a list of doctors who have left Shanghai. All of the above physicians have been approved to practice by the Shanghai Medical Committee. The above register can be purchased at the Public Works Department's General Office, Room 210, 223 Hankou Road, for one yuan per copy.</p>
<p>Neighboring Woman Injured by Falling Skylight</p>
<p>Ms. Jin (30 years old), a native of Haining, resides at No. 6 Yinyu Lane, Baxianqiao, in the French Concession. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a sudden gust of wind blew the glass skylight covering her courtyard into the courtyard of No. 7 next door. At the time, a woman was doing laundry in the courtyard and was unable to escape, resulting in a severe head injury. She was later taken to the hospital by her family for treatment, and her condition is critical.</p>
<p>Gambling Dens to Merge Operations</p>
<p>Gambling dens in western Shanghai are currently merging large and small operations. The Japanese organizers have scheduled a complete shutdown on the 15th of this month. However, after a maximum of one week, they will re-register and reopen. In the future, approximately seven to ten establishments, including Hollywood, Rongsheng, Dasheng, Guangsheng, and Daxin, will monopolize the market. A particularly large Hollywood-affiliated gambling den, owned by someone surnamed Rong, will emerge on Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>French Concession Japanese Soldiers Arrest Two Tea Drinkers</p>

They arrested two tea drinkers at a small teahouse in Xishi and escorted them to the squad headquarters. It is reported that the two arrested men are both around thirty years old. One was wearing a black wool overcoat and blue cloth trousers. They appeared to be from out of town.</p>

<p>Su Keer - Blue Team Women's 2 7:15 PM Tonight Charity Table Tennis Qingyun Jia to Battle Shanghai Mixed Team</p>
<p>8:30 PM Ningbo Fellow Association</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing and other prominent figures in Shanghai have launched a charity table tennis competition to raise funds for refugee relief. It will be held tonight starting at 8:30 PM in the auditorium of the Ningbo Fellow Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. The invited opponents are the first New Six Cup champion Qingyun Jia and the Shanghai Mixed Team, which consists of elite players from various teams in Shanghai. Before the competition, Qingyun President Li Shuxiong and Relief Association Director Xi Yushu will hold an exhibition match. Top Chinese and Western female players have also been invited to perform. The referees have been appointed as Xu Duo, Yu Binqi, Lu Zhongqiu, and Chen Linsheng. The Shanghai Mixed Team includes players from strong teams such as Guangdong, Youbang, and Hualian. The team members have been carefully selected and are all top-notch players. Rong Dengen is considered the best, having won the Shanghai individual championship for three consecutive years. However, Qingyun Jia also has many good players, such as Lu Hanjun and Li Zongpei, who have mastered their skills. A fierce battle is inevitable. Tickets are priced at five yuan, one yuan, and fifty cents. In addition to being sold at the venue, advance sales are available at the Continental Daily Inquiries Office on Avenue Edward VII. It is hoped that benevolent spectators will enthusiastically attend to benefit the refugees. The lists of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Mixed Team (Leader) Chen Linsheng (Manager) Lu Zhongqiu (Players) Rong Dengen, Zhang Liansheng, Ouyang Wei, Yang Zhaoxiang, Huang Guanrong, Guo Xiquan, Zhang Zhihong, Gao Zubei, Gui Weimin.</p>
<p>Qingyun Jia (Leader) Zhou Xinbai (Manager) Liu Kerren (Players) Lu Hanjun, Li Zongpei, Lang Depei, Zhang Ying, Ma Tingliang, Xie Shouhua, Yue Junchang, Zhu Kui-sheng, Yuan Gengshan.</p>
<p>Western Union Football Reserve League Match</p>
<p>Donghua to Play St. Francis Today</p>
<p>3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park</p>
<p>Donghua Will Win the Championship If They Win</p>
<p>There are only two Western Union football matches today. In the final Group A match, Dongselai will face Westport at 3:00 PM at the first field of the racecourse. In the other match, the Reserve League match between Donghua and St. Francis will be held at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park. Since Donghua lost to Westport last week, the championship has become questionable. This is Donghua's last match. If they win, they will win the championship. If they draw, they will tie with Westport and West Foss with 13 points each, forming a three-way tie. The winner will be determined by the number of goals scored. If they lose, their hopes for the championship will be dashed. Therefore, the stakes are high. It is hoped that the Donghua players will give their all and not let the championship, which is within reach, fall into the hands of others. The Reserve League was established in 1936. The first champion was Donghua. Only one match remains in the league, St. Francis vs. Aurora, which is irrelevant to the overall situation.</p>

Modi can easily defeat Sacred Heart, but the match against Qixiu will determine the championship and is bound to be a fierce battle. Chongde will face American Child A, which will also be a highly competitive match. In yesterday's two games, Chongde and Qixiu easily defeated American Child B and Sacred Heart, respectively.</p>

<p>Western Youth Volleyball Group A Match</p>
<p>Haiqing Defeats Paramount by a Large Margin</p>
<p>Industrial Girls' Middle School Defeats Green, White, and Red in the Women's Group</p>
<p>Meilu Team Defeats Iron Team by a Large Margin in Group B</p>
<p>Last night's Western Youth Volleyball, the Industrial Girls' Middle School vs. Green, White, and Red in the women's group, took the stage first. Green, White, and Red showed their power from the start, leading 11 to 5. Industrial Girls' Middle School quickly caught up and surpassed them, winning the first game 15 to 13. It was a pity that Green, White, and Red lost by two points. In the second game, Green, White, and Red showed signs of fatigue, and Industrial Girls' Middle School took the opportunity to attack, with Huang Mingyuan and Pan Baojian showing their skills, winning again 15 to 4. In the Group B match between Meilu and the Iron Team, the Iron Team's skills were immature, and Meilu easily defeated them 15 to 9 and 15 to 4. In the final Group A match between Haiqing and Paramount, both sides had famous players, and everyone expected a fierce battle. However, the situation turned out to be one-sided, and the entire match only took 18 minutes to end. After the start, Haiqing's Zhang Renming served and scored three points. Zheng Yiquan's spikes were fierce, while Paramount's Tan Yongzhan frequently made mistakes. When Haiqing led 12 to 0, Paramount finally scored a point, but Haiqing quickly won the game 15 to 4. In the second game, Paramount scored the first point, but Haiqing's Mai Bingyao and Han Dewei each showed their skills, scoring nine points in one go. Haiqing ultimately won again 15 to 2. The absence of Paramount's players Zhou Dayun and Huang Jiajun was likely one of the reasons for the crushing defeat. However, Haiqing's strength was indeed strong, and their victory was not a fluke. There are a total of nine matches today, including four in Group B and five in the women's group, starting at 1:15 PM.</p>

<p>The So-called "Joint Declaration" in Free Talk by Mao Lie</p>
<p>Since Germany annihilated Czechoslovakia and made demands on Romania, the British government's attitude seems to have changed a great deal, actually taking an attitude of non-recognition. Although this non-recognition cannot have any impact on Hitler, it cannot be said to be an uninspired move. Subsequently, the British government urgently proposed the matter of a "joint declaration" to the Soviet Union and France. This, of course, is another uninspired move, because it is better than inaction and complete inertia. However, how effective will this "joint declaration" actually be if the various countries sign it into being and announce it? How many international treaties have already been torn up by the strong, and these treaties were all personally signed by the strong? What consideration do the violent ones have now when they see a one-sided declaration? The annexation of Mi America, during the gestation period of this declaration, can also give us food for thought.</p>
<p>Therefore, these so-called "joint declarations," since the violent ones do not join, have already become "one-sided declarations," and the failure of Poland and the Netherlands to join further creates fissures on top of this "one-sidedness." If this declaration does eventually come into being, then of course it will become a "piecemeal declaration." A true joint declaration is an international treaty; when that's ineffective, one seeks recourse in a one-sided declaration, which is the euphemistically named joint declaration; when a one-sided declaration cannot be successfully established, one seeks recourse in a piecemeal declaration, which is the declaration currently being pursued by the British government: things get worse and worse, like one crab being worse than another. How can I not believe that the violent ones will ridicule and jeer at this!</p>
<p>I am not a violent one, so of course I have no intention of ridiculing or jeering at this kind of declaration, whether it is piecemeal, one-sided, or joint. I say this merely to point out these two things: against violent ones, any document is useless, and this "joint declaration," which is actually a "piecemeal declaration," is even more useless; against violent ones, one must use actual actions to give them a serious blow! Otherwise, I cannot help but suspect that the British government is still merely appeasing the weak and small who have been invaded: before the violent ones invade Britain itself, the British government will never take more proactive actual actions.</p>
<p>So-called actual actions do not necessarily involve mobilizing troops—if that were the case, of course, it would be best—but there are other things that can be done, such as forming a defensive line, etc. Doing so can still curb the ferocity of the aggressor. However, the British government either does not see this or sees it but is unwilling to do so, wanting to settle things with declarations alone. In that case, hoping for world peace is truly like trying to find fish in a tree!</p>
<p>Night Music of Early Spring by LK</p>
<p>Pushing open the door of the heart, twenty years of cold and heat have passed on the strings of life.</p>
<p>Yearning and attachment hang on America, the mood is like a summer night's firefly, flashing on the riverbank, the bridge, flashing through the woods, and flashing through the quiet fields.</p>
<p>It is a night serenade of the wilderness creatures, a surge and fall.</p>
<p>"Can't remember flying away?" The question from the bottom of the heart, plays the firefly's flickering.</p>
<p>One year, two years, three years... it is the vitality of youth, pushing towards the journey of life.</p>
<p>Not understanding charm, not understanding deception. The heart is as clean as white paper, letting the dawn wind rise like a swallow soaring, like an eagle flying far. Even if that is gilded scrap metal, one must try; even if that is a cruel devil, one must try; even if that is a poisonous curtain! of paradise! one must try.</p>
<p>It is the resonance of trying that attracts the comrades' calls. The calls are like the mosquitoes' buzzing in summer, gradually, gradually rising, a burst of thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>It is cursing the ugliness, and praising the beauty; it is pushing the dormancy, and restraining the recklessness; it is exposing the deception, and untying the poison; it is rebelling against the exploitation, and fighting even when blood is drawn.</p>
<p>The dormant stand up, the docile become stubborn, the hearts of slaves flow eastward with the water. Sympathy gathers the spirits together.</p>
<p>"Can't remember wanting to rush?"</p>
<p>The heart's music of the crowd, plays the spring thunder's torrent.</p>
<p>One year, two years, three years... it is the vitality of youth, pushing towards the journey of life.</p>
<p>Climbing steep mountains, wading through wilderness, for twenty years, the strings of life play a nostalgic lament, but there is still warmth, blood, ardent love, and also pursuit.</p>
<p>The blood of wounds, the blood of suffering, a drop, a heap; the sun warms them, the dawn wind blows them, the giant wheel runs over them, the blood nourishes the earth!</p>
<p>However, this is the cobblestone paving the way for the age of the masses. The younger generation strides forward.</p>
<p>Twenty years, crawling like a snail.</p>
<p>Twenty years, flying like an ocean.</p>
<p>The night serenade arouses resonance, the trying arouses struggle, my heart should have carefree laughter, leaping and congratulating myself.</p>
<p>Fireflies, flicker! brightly. Spring thunder, roar! powerfully.</p>
<p>The hearts of the masses guide me; my heart is attached to the masses. Even if there are still thorns, poison pills ahead, and that aimless trembling in the endless dark night.</p>
<p>"Don't want to fly away?" The question from the bottom of the heart, hides behind the door.</p>
<p>Twenty years, a long time; twenty years, a short process.</p>
<p>Here there is still blood, warmth, ardent love, and also pursuit.</p>
<p>"Just bring a heart of struggle! There is a god of war, but there is also a god of love!"</p>
<p>Midnight, the door of the heart closes, the strings of life play a cheerful marching tune.</p>
<p>Pillow by He Ming</p>
<p>Embroidered on the pillow is a map of China, and in the northeast corner is added a red question mark. This was embroidered and given to me by her two years ago.</p>
<p>It accompanies me to sleep every night, from darkness to light.</p>
<p>The red "question mark," I see it every day, it sternly warns me: China already has rapacious jackals, it alerts me: do not live a life of drunken stupor! It urges me even more: to do what I must do, and what I should do!</p>
<p>A bloody smell pierces my nose from the red lines, and goes straight to the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>Lying here are countless rotted dead, filled with a stream of fresh red</p>

<p>A Discussion on the Art World: The "Sitting in the Palace" Introduction and the Opening Poem by Zhang Guyu</p>
<p>"Sitting in the Palace" is the premier scene in "Visiting Mother." The Kui School's "Visiting Mother" emphasizes the bond between mother and son, brothers, siblings, and the "crying in the hall" scene depicting the tragic parting of husband and wife. The removal of the lengthy "crying in the hall" speech and the emphasis on "Sitting in the Palace" began with Yu Sansheng. This was because Yu was aware that his voice had ample tenderness but lacked tragic grandeur. To perform the entire play from beginning to end (without the return to the palace) was first pioneered by Tan Xinpei. Although Tan's voice was not as good as the various members of the Kui School at the time, the credit for his face, body, water sleeves, and 'diao mao' (饰毛, decorative feathers) were beyond the reach of those like Long Changsheng and his ilk. As the Tan School became more widespread and the Kui School lacked successors, those who study "Visiting Mother" today all regard the Tan School as the standard.</p>
<p>The Difference Between the Kui and Yu School Introductions</p>
<p>The Kui School's "Visiting Mother" introduction is: "Imprisoned in Youzhou, I think of my old mother, constantly on my mind." The Yu School's is: "The golden well locks the phoenix tree, a long sigh idly follows a gust of wind." In fact, the Kui School is better than the Yu School. The introduction is the theme of the play, like the synopsis of the script. The Yu School's "The golden well locks the phoenix tree, a long sigh idly follows a gust of wind" is neither as understandable as the Kui School's nor is its literary meaning easily decipherable. According to the famous actor Furong Cao, the "golden well" is the name of a bird, native to the north. If that's the case, then the introduction is clear. (As for Zheng Dage, Guo Yi, Su Shaoqing, Jun Fan Songhuang and others' interpretations of this introduction, they all have the flaw of forcing reason.) However, it is never as smooth and accessible as "Imprisoned in Youzhou, I think of my old mother, constantly on my mind," and the tone and cadence are also more robust. Some famous predecessors in the Ping Opera world have surprisingly said that this introduction was adopted by Tan Xinpei from Han Opera, which is laughable. I have repeatedly watched the famous Han Opera actors Wu Sanbao and Chen Erhong (i.e., Twelve Red) perform "Sitting in the Palace" (both Wu and Chen claimed it as their specialty), and Yang Yanhui always enters with a "dao ban" (倒板, a type of aria) of "self-reflection and lamentation in the palace." The appearance is the same as in Ping Opera, only he holds a folding fan. I never saw an introduction or an opening poem. When asked of the veteran actor Yu Hongyuan, he also said he had never heard of it. These people are so boastful that it is difficult for them to be masters.</p>
<p>Tan's Revision of the Opening Poem</p>
<p>The opening poem is recited: "Meeting at the beach stirred the *xiu*, lost in the foreign land for fifteen autumns; unable to kowtow before my mother in the hall, how can one not shed tears?" Some recite: "Meeting at the beach for fifteen years, geese fly past Hengyang on separate days; it's hard to see my mother in the hall, how can one not be tearful." The former is the old poem, the latter is Tan's poem. The reason Tan revised the old poem is that the lyrics of the princess, the empress dowager, and Guan's general were mostly in the *yan qian zhe* rhyme. Therefore, Yang Silang's opening poem was also changed to *yan qian*; however, some Tan School *laosheng* (老生, old male roles) still recite the old poem.</p>
<p>Time Ji Contradicts a Guest's Question</p>
<p>A guest asked me, "The princess's aria is clearly about spring (peonies and medicine flowers bloom in red, a bright and sunny day with birds chirping), but Yang Yanhui's opening poem has the line 'geese fly past Hengyang on separate days.' Are these not contradictory?" I asked in return, "How are they contradictory?" The guest said, "Swallows come in spring, geese know autumn, and geese pass Hengyang in autumn, isn't it?" I said, "You are mistaken. Youzhou is located in the north, and the Song Dynasty occupies the south. Therefore, the three words 'on separate days' are added after 'geese fly past Hengyang'. Geese fly south in autumn and return north in spring. Isn't it spring when geese fly past Hengyang to the north! Where does the contradiction come from?" The guest replied, "According to your words, then Silang's visit to his mother is in spring." I laughed and said, "Didn't you see Silang sing, 'Xiao Tianzuo arranges the Tianmen, the two countries will battle. My old mother brings food supplies to the northern barbarians'? The barbarian country is arranging their formation, and the Song camp is transporting grain, indicating that both sides are still preparing for war. Ancient wars had to wait until after the autumn harvest, so Silang's visit to his mother must be in the spring."</p>
<p>The New Invention of Film Star Makeup (Shao Zhuo)</p>
<p>American movie actors now commonly use a material with shaping effects called "No. 6". This makeup material was invented by makeup artist Tom Steele. Its advantages are threefold: (1) Regardless of the appearance, it can be transformed as desired immediately, and the procedure is simple, far surpassing the previous makeup techniques. (2) This makeup material is applied to the face to form a thin mask, but various facial expressions, such as smiling, laughing, yawning, frowning, etc., can still be expressed as usual, without any deviation. (3) This makeup material is loose in texture and can absorb sweat. It does not damage the skin when applied or removed.</p>
<p>Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette in the movie "Marie Antoinette" were made up by Tom Steele using "No. 6", lifelike and ingenious. If you compare it with Louis XVI's rubber sheet, you will not believe that it is a Hollywood actor, but suspect that it is the reincarnation of the French Emperor at the end of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association: Drama and Music Activities (Dai Zi)</p>
<p>After "August 13th," the Jingwu Athletic Association moved its headquarters from the fires of war to the third floor of the Mainland Commercial Building. In addition to focusing on the training of martial arts and skills, the association also has various other activities, with a wide range and many categories. This article only reports on drama and music activities.</p>
<p>Spoken Drama</p>
<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association's drama group was recently established and held its inaugural meeting on December 20 last year. The main members who joined the group are Zhu Lianxiang, Zhou Fuxing, Tao Tianwen, Chen Yunzhang, Tu Changyao, Weng Changning, Luo Jianhua, Shao Yuanzhao, Lu Hong, Shen Jinkang, Ou Renliang, Tu Hengyao, Xu Shaoxia, Tong Peiqing, Shi Pinhai, You Jingjuan, Fan Dianxia, ​​Tian Yurong, Hu Junmin, Shen Xisan, Xia Wuxin, Lin Xianian, Yu Fo, etc. Zhu Xiang also serves as the director, and Wu Renzhi, Hua Sha, and Xu Yi serve as instructors. They practice three times a week, from 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Tian Yurong is responsible for teaching and reading scripts to ensure correct pronunciation. They are currently rehearsing the two-act play "Dumb Wife" and "A Father Returns". After the rehearsals are pure and proficient, they will be trial performances.</p>
<p>Peking Opera</p>
<p>Peking Opera is also an activity under the Jingwu Athletic Association's music department. All members of the association can join, with a monthly fee of two yuan and twenty yuan per year. The General Assembly annually elects committee members to serve as drama affairs, accounting, and document affairs. Except for Sundays, the practice time is from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm every day. A full-dress rehearsal is held once a year. Before the full-dress rehearsal, the practice time will be longer than usual. Now Mr. Qian Yangtian and Mr. Wang Runqing are responsible for teaching.</p>
<p>Cantonese Music</p>
<p>Cantonese music is divided into Class A and Class B. Class A is the advanced class and Class B is the beginner class. Classes are held three times a week, from 7:45 pm to 8:45 pm. Class A and Class B take turns. The purpose of establishing the Cantonese music department is to enable members to study music, songs, and cultivate their sentiments. In addition to paying a deposit, members do not pay any fees. However, once registered, if you cannot attend classes on time, there will be penalties and you will be punished according to the rules. Students provide their own musical instruments, and Mr. Chen Junying is responsible for teaching. Not long ago, all the students in the class also participated in the Xin Xin Radio broadcast to raise funds to help refugees, and the results were quite good.</p>
<p>Harmonica</p>
<p>The harmonica team was recently established to promote popular music, with three classes per week, one hour each time. It specializes in teaching the latest harmonica playing methods, knowledge of musical symbols, popular Chinese and Western songs, and all the essentials of harmonica art. A period of three months, members pay a registration fee of one yuan, and non-members pay three yuan for the entire period. A harmonica specialist is hired to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Dance World Reflections: Xiao Tian's Fun in Visiting the Dance Hall</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Rengong said, "If I were to use chemistry to analyze this thing called Liang Qichao, and extract an element called 'fun' from it, I'm afraid there would only be zero left." Mr. Liang is an advocate of Hedonism. He once gave a footnote to the meaning of Hedonism, saying: "Anything done that does not produce a result contrary to fun can be the subject of fun." He also set the most important condition for Hedonism: "Doing what one does for the sake of doing it." That is to say, do not use what you do as a means and another thing as the end. For example, studying for a diploma is to obtain the diploma as the end and studying as the means; being an official to get rich is to get rich as the end and being an official as the means; being a monk and a philanthropist to defraud pious women of money is to defraud money as the end and being a monk and a philanthropist as the means; if the end is not achieved, it will produce a result contrary to fun.</p>
<p>Based on the above theory, I hope that people who like to visit dance halls should visit dance halls for the sake of visiting dance halls, and not for other purposes. If the purpose is to be lively and sociable, you can go to lively banquet places. If you like listening to Western music, you can turn on the radio at home. If the purpose is to pursue women, there are other opportunities to approach women besides dance halls. I agree with Mr. Liang's principle of Hedonism, but I do not agree with Mr. Liang's conclusion that there is no fun outside of learning. He said, "Is gambling fun? What if you lose? Is drinking fun? What if you get sick?" I think if you gamble for the sake of gambling, there is no point in discussing winning or losing. So-called winning is delightful, and losing is also happy. If you gamble to win money, it is better not to gamble. Therefore, before gambling, you must estimate how much money you can afford to lose, so that losing money will not produce a result contrary to fun. The same is true for drinking. Just remember the motto "Drinking without limit leads to chaos."</p>
<p>Of course, visiting dance halls is to find fun. If you want to find boredom, who in the world likes to find boredom? However, to maintain the fun from beginning to end, you must consider in advance: the first point is the economic problem, just like I said above, how much money you are prepared to lose when gambling. The second point is not to have a single object. For example, you love to have this dancer dance with you, but others also love to have this dancer dance with them, and others walk up to her first, or even call her to sit at the table or buy her out. At that time, if you do not regard this dancer as your only object, you can choose another dancer to dance with, and you can still feel fun. The third point is not to have other purposes besides dancing. Regarding this point, I have already said it above, but for the sake of completeness, I might as well say a few more words. For example, you like to dance with this dancer, so you ask her to dance, or even ask her to sit at the table, or buy a ticket to go to another dance hall, that's all fine, but you must not hope that she also likes to dance with you. If you love her and hope that she loves you, then your chances of disappointment may come, wouldn't it produce a result contrary to fun? Confucius said, "A gentleman seeks it in himself, a petty man seeks it in others." This can be applied here.</p>

<p>Shanghai's Comedic Ping Opera Troupes (Liang Yan)</p>
<p>Singing Ping Opera in a comedic way to bring laughter to the audience is indeed a kind of noble entertainment. Currently, there are as many as six such comedic Ping Opera troupes in the isolated island, each with its own merits, and they can cater to the audience's tastes. They also united to plead for the refugees and performed in a joint show at the Renewal Stage once, and the results were impressive, which shows that they are a popular troupe. Now, the lineup of each troupe is surveyed as follows:</p>
<p>New Voice Troupe</p>
<p>Starring Mi Yisu, Fang Xiaowu, Chen Wuwo, and Xu Xiaotian, recently joined by an eight-year-old prodigy, the lineup is the most complete, because only this troupe can be said to have: *sheng* (male roles), *dan* (female roles), *jing* (painted face roles), and *chou* (clown roles). The prodigy has a voice, has skills, and even more gags. Their specialties include "Scolding the Palace," "Scolding Cao," "Being Escorted," "Ganlu Temple," etc., and are currently performing in the Great World.</p>
<p>Elegant Troupe</p>
<p>The actors are Fang Renmi, Wang Mazi, and Zhang Haming. They have been working together for a long time, so they are the most skilled. Wang Mazi and Zhang Haming's performance of "Mending the Jar" is the most popular, and "Entering the Palace" and "Famen Temple" are also their specialties, performing at the Da Xin Amusement Park.</p>
<p>Sea New Troupe</p>

<p>The Secret History of the Forbidden City Palace and the Pear Garden (129) by Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Because of Visiting Mother's Crossing the Border, Talk About the Relationship Between Empress Dowager Cixi and An Dehai</p>
<p>Today he was still the same as usual, so of course no one thought anything of it. Who would have thought that as soon as he straddled the mule, he suddenly turned the mule's head around, added a whip, and flew madly towards the pass. By the time the confidants sent by Prince Su pulled the horses over and chased after him, it was already too late. Moreover, his swift mule was used to this kind of daily morning exercise, so today it ran extraordinarily fast when something happened. Little Anzi arrived at the Imperial City in the blink of an eye, "proclaiming the imperial decree" to the ministers, and captured the rebel ministers such as Prince Su, welcoming the Empress Dowager back to Beijing. Therefore, the Empress Dowager attributed all the credit to An Dehai alone, so she later favored him very much. Little Anzi was young and handsome, with a shaved green scalp and a long braid, which made him even more lovable. He was also ignorant of worldly affairs and relied on his merits to be arrogant. Sometimes, he would even show frivolity and disrespect in front of the Empress Dowager, so outsiders said that An Dehai had an affair with the Empress Dowager and was a fake eunuch. Even the governors of the outer provinces heard this. Coincidentally, the Shandong Governor Ding Baozhen was introduced to the court. This man was from Pingyuan County, Guizhou, and was a *jinshi* (進士, successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations). He had helped quell the Miao rebellion and the Eastern and Western Nian rebellions. He was a resolute and upright person. An Dehai thought he was also bald, and without knowing the severity, he even laughed at him for being old. Ding Baozhen had originally heard of his deeds, and on top of that, he had been mocked today, so as soon as he left Beijing, he planned to make him his dinner. Unexpectedly, the damned Little Anzi insisted on asking for the errand of going to Beijing to make dragon robes. He brought a large number of people with him, swaggered along the way, and made a great show of power, harassing the people and coercing government officials. Who knows how many sins he committed. Just as he was about to arrive in Jinan, Shandong, Ding Baozhen received two imperial edicts from the Empress Dowager and a secret edict from the Emperor. According to the rumors at the time, it was said that the new Emperor and the civil and military officials of the court saw that Little Anzi was lawless, so they secretly conspired to trick him out of the capital so that they could get rid of him on a pretext. Therefore, they issued a secret edict ordering Ding Baozhen to kill him. Unexpectedly, the Empress Dowager heard about this and issued another imperial edict ordering Ding to protect him. She feared that her lover would be harmed, so she sent the imperial edict to Shandong with a rapid horse at 800 li (里, a Chinese unit of distance) per day. If it were someone else, they would have let Little Anzi pass. Old Ding wanted to avenge his personal grudges and also wanted to earn a reputation for being upright, so he disregarded everything and suppressed the imperial edict. When An Dehai arrived in Jinan, he announced the imperial edict, captured him, and according to the Qing law, inner eunuchs were royal slaves and were not allowed to leave Beijing even a step. Now, on the charge of "leaving Beijing without permission," he killed the once-popular An Dehai.</p>
<p>Chess Garden edited by Bao Zibo, reviewed by Lu Chengzhu</p>
<p>Opening Game Methods, Game 23</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Anti-Palace Horse Versus Central Cannon Horizontal Chariot Method</p>
<p>The Moves Connect to the Previous Game</p>
<p>Chariot 1 to 6, Chariot 9 to 2, Horse 8 Advances to 9, Pawn 7 Advances 1</p>
<p>(Explanation) The movement from Cannon 2 to 5 to Cannon 8 to 7 is all explained earlier. In the previous game, the black side's Horse 8 advanced to 7, but now it advances to 9, which is a side horse game. Its intention is not to attack the middle road. The horse advances slowly, which is a stable method. The black side's Chariot 9 advances 1, horizontal chariot, using a horizontal chariot against a horizontal chariot. Each has its own merits. Chariot 1 to 6, the opponent has already responded with a horizontal chariot, so moving to 6 first occupies the important road. Chariot 9 to 2 captures the horse, forcing Horse 8 to advance to 9. If the opponent does not capture at this time, then after the opponent's Sixth Chariot is promoted, the horse can advance to 6. Comparing advancing to 6 with a side horse, advancing to 6 is stronger. If the red side does not occupy the chariot road first, but advances the horse to 6 first, then the chariot has no road. Therefore, the black side's Chariot 9 advancing 1 is indeed a good move. In this game, the red side's opening game is very stable and quick, but the most taboo is that the opponent also deploys a horizontal chariot to force a surprise horse. Pawn 7 advancing 1 restricts the horse, preventing the activity of the third road horse, that is, preventing the side horse from taking root, which is a hidden restraining method. At this time, although the situation is not a major problem for both sides, the black side raising a horizontal chariot is slow, but the moves are tightening, and the momentum is eager to try. The red side is under pressure and seems difficult to move.</p>
