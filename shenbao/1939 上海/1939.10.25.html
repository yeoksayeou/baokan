<h3 id="c16">日本恢復理智歟？ <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>二旬之前，中日會戰於湘北，華軍大勝；此在中國抗戰中，有關軍事，值得大書特書之一事也。四日之前，美國駐日大使格魯氏對於日本之侵略行為，予以率直嚴峻之警告；此在中國抗戰中，有關國際，値得大書特書之又一事也。二事既為中外所周知。茲又有一事，為昨日日本東京國民新聞所紀述，路透所電傳；國民新聞素有軍部言論機關之目者也，昨述如次：</p>
<p>（路透社二十四日東京電）國民新聞今日稱、今已屆最後淸理自瀋陽事變以來所有國內與政治局勢之時期、今後發展至堪注意、政黨近來異常紛碌、一般印象以為「中國事件現可認為將近結束」、而反對政黨者之勢力、今在政治局勢壓力下、業已衰落、故政黨當可複握政權、同時阿部內閣虛弱無力、接近日皇之前輩政治家現抱有一種意見、以為目前過渡之內閣、刻漸臻於共存在之極度、稍緩時日、政黨內閣之出現、當屬可能云、國民新聞又稱、「中國事件既近結束」、國際外交壓力將愈堅强、而國內經濟困難、亦將愈甚、故唯有可得全國贊助之內閣、始能克服此困難局勢云、</p>
<p>此在中國抗戰中，有關日本內情之最新報告；以日本新聞檢查之嚴格，以國民新聞之品位，我人不能不置信於此項紀述之準確；此而準確，其值得大書特書，雖謂應與湘北大勝，美國警告，等量齊觀可也。三者絕對有利於中國，自不待煩言；雖然，非意外之演進也，非僥倖之收穫也，僅以證實二三年來中國與同情中國者對於抗戰之種種見解與判斷之準確而已。</p>
<p>有利於中國之事實情况，絡繹而來，一一羅陳於視綫之前；夫誰復能矯情而自遏其異常欣慰？然就中日大局前途而論，猶有歧途，有待日本抉擇；而我人於欣慰之際，亦仍應心平氣和，審思靜觀。何以言之？日本繼續侵略，以迄澈底勝敗，則今後之若干歲月。僅為二三年來相搏相殺之延長，此一途也。日本放棄侵略，以圖澈底和平，則今後之二三月內，應見急轉直下而豁然開朗，此一途也。由前之說，中國惟有繼續抗戰；至於抗戰之必曠日持久，抗戰之必慘痛犧牲，抗戰初期以軍備不如人而沿海沿江之必備遭兵燹，非戰而知之，乃於決心抗戰之前，明見之，深知之且公言之；所信者，在後期軍事，在內地地利，在人物潛力，在正義，在公道，在國際同情援助，以爭最後勝利。由後之說，中國祇要中日平等，祗耍保持獨立，祗要主權領土行政之完整；在此政治原則之下，中國既是偉大市塲，又有豐厚富源，則日本以及任何一國而以其資本人才來相合作，可謂適應經濟供需原則之自然狀態；既無待空言歡迎，然非可盟之城下！此在一九一八」，日本所謂瀋陽事變之前，中國懷疑日本之包藏禍心而不敢輕言合作；茲姑不必多方論述日本往年之居心如何，而一九一八」之變以迄今茲，日本之侵略行為適以證實中國懷疑之不謬。八年黷武，兩年血戰，各付絕大之代價而是否自此相識相安相善相合作，惟視日本已吾恢復其理智而已。</p>
<p>湘北之戰績，猶非決定勝敗之戰爭，然應有帮助日本恢復理智之效，蓋應知繼續侵略在軍事方面為無望。美國之警告，猶非實力壓迫之實行，亦應有帮助日本恢復理智之效，蓋應知繼續侵略為國際方面所不容。軍事無望如此，國際不容如彼；謂必待日愈久，兵愈老，一敗再敗乃至慘敗不可收拾，而後已歟？謂必待美國所謂見之政策行動，淋漓盡致，絕無餘地，而後已歟？日本應愚不至此。而昨日彼國民新聞所記政治上之醞釀，以及所謂「中國事變既近結束，國際外交壓力將愈堅强，國內經濟困難亦將愈甚，」如此感覺，如此自白，吾固樂於視為日本亦既漸漸恢復其理智之徵者也。所待攷者：彼所謂「中國事件既近結束」。何所合義乎？迄今日為止，我人於日本在軍事以外之種種擬議，種種作為，備見之矣，不但無一而可望結束此事件，亦且無一而可望終止此戰爭！要知戰爭狀態必與日軍留華時期相終始；而結束事件必待平等獨立完整之政治原則之確立！在此軍事尚未慘敗不可收拾之時，國際壓力尚未淋漓盡致之日，乃為日本「淸理其國內政治局勢」，與中國政府掬誠相向，圖謀解紛之最好時機，抑亦最後時機。幡然改圖則急轉直下，披肝瀝胆則豁然開朗。</p>

<p>香港　東京電、日內閣今晨舉行會議、決定將日圓與英鎊脫離關係、轉向美金相連擊、大藏省發表聲明稱、此項決講完全由於經濟方面之因素、並非志在變更日本商務政策、前次日圓以一圓合一先令二便士之比價、與英鎊相連繫、但在戰事爆發後、英國政府為預防戰事之久延時日、對外滙之統制日益加强、因此日政府為便利日本國外資金之移動起見、決定將日圓改與美金連繫、至於日圓與美金之比價、係以最近行情為基礎、據各辦理外滙銀行界今日會商之決定、將日圓之比價定為每百圓合美金二十三又十六分之七元（二十四日電）</p>
<p>東京　日政府今日會議、決定變更對英一先令二便士之滙兌基準、即日由大藏省發表如次、並宣布自十月二十五日實施、日本貨幣對外滙兌行情、向置其基準於英鎊、規定一先令二便士之行情、然英國現因戰爭發生漸次强化之買收滙兌政策、以備長期戰爭、因此日本為操作海外資金之便利起見、決定改置滙兌基凖於美元、而當此變更之際、關於應如何規定日本滙兌行情之問題、考慮對外貿易及其他方面所受影響、為避免激變起見、決定以最近滙價為基準、今日與銀行協議之結果、議定以對美電匯二十三元十六分之七為基準滙價、今次變更完全出於經濟的理由、並非根據變更日本通商政策者、固無待言也云、（二十四日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　日本滙兌行市基準改為美元後、日本銀行總裁結城豐太郎發表談話謂、日本從來滙兌政策、維持對英一先令二便士之匯價、以期安定圓價之對外價值、使貿易及一般經濟界得好影響、然自八月下旬、歐洲情形緊迫、同時英鎊發生搖動、其對美匯價由四元六角八分、跌落至三元八角二分、而日本以對英一先令二便士匯價算出之對美匯價亦大跌、因此暫時固定對美匯價、以為急應處置、其後採用由英蘭銀行公定匯價算出對美匯價之方法而至今日、在此時期中、英國隨從戰爭之進行、漸次强化匯兌管理之運用、日本考慮其對國內財界之影響、遂以匯兌基準由英鎊改為美元、此為最適宜之方法云云、（二十四日同盟社電）</p>

<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>（三）戰前一剎那外　交形勢的追述</p>
<p>前天（一日）上午六點鐘左右，希特勒開始了對波蘭的軍事攻擊。那末，這樣子歐洲這一次大戰，又正式揭幕了？</p>
<p>然而，前天和昨天，此地大家的意見，却並不十分肯定。一致認定是；當前的問題關鍵，繫之於英。法。之是吾履行對波的互助協定。所以這兩天以來，波蘭駐英大使，幾乎是終日地坐在央國外交部，等待確切的回答；而英國的輿論，也都一致地動了員，督促他們的政府，趕緊採迅速而堅決的行動。</p>
<p>可是，英政府的第一個舉動，却是；致一個最後通牒與德國政府。令其即刻把軍隊撤出波蘭；吾則的話，英國就「祇有履行對波的互助義務」了。</p>
<p>這一個措置，在當時，是絕對未能滿足一般人的願望；因為大家所希冀着的，却是逕直的，當然的對德宣戰，所以，前天晚上六點鐘英國上下兩議院開會時，政府與議員們之間的隔閡，是相當深刻的。允其在下議院裹，反對黨領袖們所說堅決而又明確的話，那作用，實在是把他們政府，逼到了一個萬難逃避履行對波義務的地步。</p>
<p>頂糟糕的，是英。法。對德國的最後通牒，並沒有附以答覆時間的限制！於是，謠言又起來了。不過在這裏要特別指明：除了謠言而外，的的確確，也有着許許多多的外交具體活動。一面是砲火連天的大戰，另一面，却又同時進行着外交的接洽。</p>
<p>照常例，外交走到山窮水盡，於是發生了戰爭；戰爭　開始，外交就跟着停止了活動。然而這一决却不然。就在這德波已經發生戰爭的這兩天內，德·波。之間，也還在通過了墨索里尼，而進行着接洽。即使在今天十一點鐘以前，波，蘭對德屈服的可能，還是存在着的。所謂屈服，大前提當然是接受德國提出的「十六條款」。</p>
<p>毫無疑義，這是一個大大的危機！——並不僅僅是波蘭的危機；允其重要，却是關聯了英·法。兩帝國整個的未來！</p>
<p>現在呢，這一個危機，總算已經過去，今天上午九鐘，英·法。再向德國提出一次强硬的，答覆最後通牒的時問限制，限定兩小時內答覆。時間一到了十一點，英。法·正式和德國宣了戰。</p>
<p>希特勒的武力外交，這對波蘭的一圈裹，總算失敗了。接下去，當然是戰爭。</p>
<p>不過，我們觀察歐洲這一次大戰揭幕前後的形勢，却非常明顯地，注意到了牠的一個特點，那是：作戰的兩方，一面是英法，一面是德國。都沒有作大規模，徹底消滅對方力量的最後決心與準備；他們這一决的戰爭行動，嚴格地說，不過還是在辦着武力外交而巳。換句話說，這樣的戰爭，兩方面外交的接洽，絕無吿止的時候，而在每一個戰局的韓移裹，隨時隨地，都存在着結束戰事，取得妥協的潛在可能性。</p>
<p>什麼是造成這一决戰爭這一個特點的最根本原因呢？毫無疑義的，是因為社會主義國家蘇聯的龐大存在。</p>
<p>所以墨索里尼並沒有參戰。——這將是歐洲未來局勢裏，最值得注意的一個腳色。（九月三日下午）</p>
<p>（四）英國的「準備」</p>
<p>「嗚……嗚……！」「嗚……嗚……！」……</p>
<p>那麼高亢·尖銳·而又顫抖地，在淸寂的倫敦高空裹響着的，是警報着空襲的氣笛。從我住的三層樓上聽去，彷彿這一種警報的設備，是佈遍了整個的天涯海角。那瀰漫着，此起彼伏着，愈近愈刺耳，愈遠愈低微的，抖動着的聲音，好像是充滿了所有的空間，延展到遙遠的遙遠的，更加遙遠的，……地平綫的那一面去。</p>
<p>在這種聲音裹，你立刻司以想像到，然而，你好像看見似的。有成千成萬的人們，這時候，被從床上喚起來了。</p>
<p>就在我這住　處的鄰近，現在，正有一架氣笛，在大聲地鳴吼着。而在我這住處的頭頂天空裹，却忽然浮起了好幾個龐大的氣球。—好像從地裹一下子冒了出來似的。（讓我坦白地自承；這是我事前連一點象跡也沒有覺察出來的。）</p>
<p>窗子外面，籠罩着無底無邊的一團漆黑。厚密地遮住了洋蠟的光綫，在大的一塊豆腐乾般大小面積的光裹，我在寫着這一段。可是樓梯響起來了，響着，響着，……——好像有人上樓來。……（未完）</p>

<p>— 百敏</p>
<p>譯密勒氏評論報</p>
<p>美國橫渡太平洋的貿易和航運，因為中國境內的不斷戰爭和歐戰爆發的結果，現遇許多新的困難，將來也許還會加多。南起新加坡，北迄堪察加的美國商業和航運，近來巳受或不久將受種種新的短縮。限制。和統制。現時美國商業不能自由出入遠東的程度，是巳往幾十年來所米見的。</p>
<p>正使日本搖動着的嚴重經濟危機，顯然沒有使日本軍閥服理悔過，日本軍閥非但不終止其釀成這種危機的在華冒險，且正作新的努力，集中其國家經濟實力的剩餘，繼續對華戰爭。日本在國內外的買賣力，常在低落，而日本的軍事統治者，繼續截斷日本的對外貿易，以供自己的迫切需要。日本自美國的輸入品，目前祇以直接或間接軍需品為限了。</p>
<p>本年七月十六日，美國務院廢止一九一一年美日商的，只在十月二十六日以後的三個月，就將期滿，現在很少延長時期的希望，或竟沒有這種希望，而東京與華盛頓訂立新的的希望，更其微弱。本星期同盟通訊社會傳日首相阿部在十月十六日宣稱，他以為美日或將締結臨時條的，但還沒有開始，或準備談判。照現象看來，日本是不願改變其在華侵佔區內排斥美國商　的歧視政策，然而，這種改變，似乎是美日任何新商的的必要條件吧。</p>
<p>據現象看，相反地日本將續作強烈的努力，以關　中國境內的開放門戶」。數週來，日人和其傀儡政權已在磋商和準備着排斥泰西制度的「統一一，這種制度，便是在侵佔區內各地從事獨佔貿易和外滙統制。天津的經濟封鎖，自近來華北大水退去後，巳重新加強。日人目下還在經濟上封鎖上海的泰西商業利益，中日戰爭最初兩年中，繼續自華中內地運到上海租界的許多原料和食物，近數星期來，巳遭日人為自己利益起見而加阻止了。被阻的貨物，現在不但包括絲繭。原棉。和桐油，且連米·蛋·和鬃等，也在其內。上海的輸出業，美國投有重大資金，且是這些出口品的最重要顧客，日人現正故意企圖使上海的出口業陷於絕境。</p>
<p>日海軍封鎖中國海岸，正在不斷擴展着，浙閩邊界附近的占鰲頭港，近遭封鎖，日人巳令外國航運離開該港，更向南去。日人對於仍在華方手中的小口岸加強轟炸的恐怖，而使香港與他港的經濟往來，更加隔絕，香港所剩的對華南貿易，現在多集中在葡屬澳門和法屬廣州灣，日軍近佔珠江三角洲區的石岐，將澳門和毘鄰的華方拉壩（譯音）口岸與內地聯絡截斷，使香港只剩取道廣州灣而入「自由中國」的一條路錢，日軍現在還預備在法國租借地近郊登陸呢。</p>
<p>華南海岸英法殖民地中的美國商業，因歐戰爆發結果而遇新的貿易利外滙統制，美人巳不再能目由滙款出入這些殖民地，也不再能在那裹自由獲得原料，而美國工業的原料供給，却大都仰給於這些殖民地，允其是橡皮和錫。就美國商梁來說　新加坡和香港兩大口岸，實已失了自由港的眞正性質，就像大連在兩年多以前失了那種性質一樣。</p>
<p>在香港除了中國，緩重要的貿易夥伴是美國，而新加坡的商業，美國佔着絕對控制的地位。新加坡的原料市塲，像英帝國的其他各地一樣，自歐戰爆發後，巳受嚴格的價格統制。新加坡的橡皮·錫。和其他物價，現受不自然的防止，不得超過倫敦經濟戰爭政策。自英國戰爭消耗的觀點看來，認為適合的某種水準，而數星期來這些相同貨物在美國的價格却已大漲。留待日後答覆的問題，是美國將吾許在新加坡照較低的統制價格探購，或是美國將吾必須遵照美國物價水準所定的較高價格而採購。</p>
<p>遠東大陸的整個太平洋沿岸，只剩一個大口岸，在那裏外國貨物可自由輸入，出口品可自由運出，過境貿易可自由經營，同時那裹還存着不受任何外匯統制的公開匯市，這口岸便是上海。在這口岸已有巨大的美國利益陷於危境，而且這口岸對於美國的遠東貿易和其他商業，多半將具更大的重要性，所以美國協助至少維持這口岸的開放，和本身極有利害關係，這是異常明瞭的。美國對華貿易，大部份集中在上海，同樣的上海是美國在華商業投資的中心地，上海公共租界的行政機關，美人佔有　著的一份，公共租界的工部局便是由美國公民一人任主席的。</p>
<p>日人在日本，藝人在中國，英法人在其殖民地，當然有權採取其所擇取的一切經濟計劃。美國商業利益受道種計劃的打擊，所剩覓取補救的途徑，只是談判一途，但日人在上海當然無權為所欲為，而開始經濟封鎖，截斷滬市和內地的聯絡，與侵犯穩固樹立，而由國際條的保證其自由活動的泰西利益，在上海沒有一國有權封閉「開放的門戶，」任何一國企圖出此，非但使美國在遠東的經濟利益深受損害，且確然侵害美國的權利和特權。歐戰現巳發作，上海仍是遠東比較自由的口岸，而大增其重要性，英法殖民地口岸既已在戰時經濟統制之下，那末，今日日本對付上海的每一種行動，對於美國利益，較前有更大的損害，所以，美國的在滬利益，必須予以維持。</p>
<p>觀於上海對美國利益的特別重要性，本市美國航業界對於現在的美國中立法修改事，向華盛頓提出詰問，是極正當的。現在務須大為謹愼，以防未來的美國新中立法特性的運用，不利於上海美國商業利益，而間接有利於日人。美國若對英法整個屬地，竟完全援用中立法，而駛往香港西　和新加坡的美國航運，竟被减少或停止，那末，只剩上海是遠東大陸上支持美國東方航運的唯一重要口岸了。若在上海，使日人受到教訓，而不染指滬市仍由泰西各國管理的部份，那末，美國航運在美國法律之下因有治外法權，而將享航行上的特殊便利。</p>
<p>近幾個月來，美國的橫波太平洋航運己將強有力的重趨繁盛，大來輸船公司改祖成美國總統輪船公司，普奇桑特東方輪船公司新近開設，和美國海事委員會倡導下的大規模造船，都是這重趨繁盛的重要因素。美海事委員會現以每年五十二艘或每週一艘的比例，建造新式貨輸，第一艘新貨輪已在幾月前下水，目前正在完成中，在很短的時間中，這些貨輪將初决出現海上，它的重要趨勢，是在增加太平洋海面的美國航運，這並不是秘密的事件。此外，對於歐洲交戰國援引修正後的中立法，允其是「現款自運」原則，將使大批美船閒泊，而將駛進太平洋，覓尋代替的商業。</p>
<p>在這些情勢下，還從美國航運的觀點看來，美國似乎不堪失却它對於在滬立足點的自由出入，但是，若許日人完全壓制滬市，結果就會失去這種自由出人的。</p>

<p>昨日下午五時三刻、榆林路捕房轄境內、發生一四角戀愛之桃色殺人案、茲紀情形如左、</p>
<p>揚州人杜德發、現年三十歲、向在福州路一百二十號金龍理髮店內為夥、於九年前、與同鄉婦人王秀英姘識、現同居於虹口榆林路一百八十一弄二十三號門牌前樓、育有一子、年六歲、取名小狗子、但秀英年雖三十有四、實為一</p>
<p>水性楊花</p>

<p>不常返家</p>
<p>迨至十七號夜、杜德發回家、則見王秀英仍在、并未赴揚、不覺幾竇頓生、以王實有不守婦道行為、遂起爭吵、經一度之口角、其事遂寢、翌晨杜仍赴店中辦事、至二十號上午十時、杜忽接劉林福之電話、囑速卽歸家、杜乃回去、既入室、則見劉與王秀英均在、劉當向杜曰、爾妻不貞、與周永才相戀已有二年、此次秀英</p>
<p>藉故赴揚</p>
<p>實際暗中與周同居云云、杜聞語、不覺大怒、向王嚴詰、但王吾認、謂彼與周無關、而與劉則有曖昧關係、設若不信、可同往周處對質、經向周永才對質之下、并無結果、迨至二十三日晨、劉邀杜出外、同至浙江路福園茶樓商議、決定購買三角式之鋒利刺刀一柄、將周永才殺死、以洩憤、遂由劉林福以二元之代價、向滿庭坊購得前項刺刀</p>
<p>暗藏身畔</p>
<p>共同返家、即着王秀英出外找尋周永才、但王出外許久未回、劉杜二人、乃跟踪出外、至下午五時餘、因尋周無着而回、不料見王秀英已獨自先返、杜乃與之爭吵、但王女孔武有力、杜竟不敵踣地、乃呼劉帮忙、詎劉突出刺刀、將王女胸腹各部連戳數下、致傷在要害、立時倒地、血流成渠、</p>
<p>氣息奄奄</p>

<p>— 魏如晦</p>
<p>「碧血花」的寫作，是取材於余曼翁的「板橋雜記」，所以，如果有人要問何為而作，吾將引曼翁「板橋雜記」自敘中的話答之，曰：「有所為而作也。」</p>
<p>此「有所為」具有若何內容，則在劇本中，巳完全說及，無須重述。本文祇略述關於本劇寫作簡單經過。</p>
<p>已是兩年前事，某夜，往觀歐陽予倩兄所作改良平劇「桃花扇」。在塲中，由於對李香君此一傳奇人物之重溫，憶起「板橋雜記」中，尚有較香君更具積極性之人物。首先憶起的，是至死不屈斷舌噴血之葛嫩。其激昂慷慨，可歌可泣之史實，頗有成一歷史劇之必要。</p>
<p>故返家以後，即將「板橋雜記」重讀一過。由葛嫩而孫克咸，由克咸而余曼翁，王微波，再由曼翁而李十娘，由微波而蔡如蘅，竟成一連串不可分離之人物。而此三對人物，又覺代表三種傾向；微波，如蘅一對，更恰成為「反派」。於是遂決定用此六人作為人物中心，根據此一主義綫發展，寫出全部明末史實。</p>
<p>但由於其他方面工作關係，僅寫及三頁原稿，便行擱置。直至今春，梅益兄編「華美晨報」「浪花」，囑寫一長篇，遂決定利用此一機緣，來完成對自己許下之願望。於是忙裹偷閒，遂日成原稿二紙，陸續送去發表。不久，梅益兄回「譯報」，繼任者為于由兄，自又無法推托，故祇得再繼續寫去。前後凡兩閱月，共完成兩幕半，不幸「華晨」停刊，此劇又行擱置。</p>
<p>孰知內地劇團，聞此劇寫作，竟連函催索，「中旅」「中救」，期待允殷，「上海劇藝社」預吿，更早已發表。在各方催促之下，祇得放棄其他工作，從事整理，並續寫未完成部分。前後凡數度改作，全易初稿舊觀。</p>
<p>此劇由「劇藝社」諸同志，及劉瓊，章志直，嚴斐，趙恕，斐冲諸兄協助，得在上海作初次演出，衷心極為感慰。允難得者，若靑離滬三載，恰於此時歸來。征塵甫卸，即來相助，日夕排演，備極勞頓，嗚呼！吾眞不知何以謝之。</p>
<p>此外欲並謝者，則吳永剛兄導演此劇，心勞神瘁；宣剛兄製譜配樂，煞費苦思；柳亞子先生，對史實多所示正；亦皆永莫能忘。</p>
<p>其自始至終，襄助此劇完成者，有于伶兄；予以最大精神鼓勵者，有遠在桂林之夏衍兄，上年生死患難交，不敢言謝，謹以此劇慰之。</p>
<p>十月二十四日。</p>
<h3 id="c97">介紹「明末遺恨」 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 天問</p>
<p>上海劇藝社自公演「賽金花」後，又排演「明末遺恨」，並在籌備「陳圓圓」的演出。排演歷史劇果然是適應「此時此地」的環境，但也正如電影公司競攝古裝片一樣，應該批判地接受歷史的教訓，而反映現實為主要條件，魏如晦改編「賽金花」時的鄭重，與乎此次編為「明末遺恨」時的數易原稿，這種認眞的工作精神，比之出賣色情，隨意「翻版」者，常然是不可同日而語。</p>
<p>「明末遺恨」原名「碧血花」，一二兩幕曾在華美晨報的「浪花」上發表，華美晨報停刊後，該劇也沒有繼續寫下去，最近上海劇藝社急於要排演這個戲，原作者就重將一二兩幕修改過，而繼續寫成三四幕。在修改與續寫的時間內，因為一邊在趕着排演，內容幾乎每天在改動，到現在演出，誠如「碧血花公演前記」中所說：全易舊觀。</p>
<p>一二兩幕的改正本，我已看過，三四兩幕，我看到的祇是最初的油印本，經過這兩天的徹夜排演，大概又修改了不少地方。現在把大略的淸形，介紹如下：</p>
<p>第一幕：是史可法在揚州殉節，金陵淪陷前夜。淸流派孫亞咸因遭馬士英的忌妬，縱情聲色，熱戀秦淮名妓葛嫩娘。但是馬士英的爪牙蔡如蘅隨時監視着他。等到金陵情勢危急，蔡如蘅自然做了識時務的「俊傑」，孫克咸堅決不肯離開金陵，葛嫩娘却是個深思遠慮的巾幗丈夫，她以毀容自刎相逼，他們終於在混亂中離開金陵。</p>
<p>第二幕：是寫鄭芝龍鄭成功的父子衝突。成功答父書中有「父自叛明，子自忠明，父勿能吾強也！」就是在葛嫩娘求救被辱，鄭母訓子盡忠後，鄭成功棄文就武焉。</p>
<p>第三幕：是金陵的舊友重聚，他們退據山中？以游擊方式以抗淸兵。這時候的蔡如蘅，居然以「何必兩敗俱傷」的「論調一來勸葛嫩娘投降，但在淸兵四面圍攻的時候，他們全體率衆誓師。</p>
<p>第四幕：孫克咸與葛嫩娘的被捕。淸帥博洛惑於嫩娘美色，擬「收為己有」，同時王微波（是蔡如蘅的夫人，現在應該是稱謂博洛的中國太太了。）也來勸說，葛嫩娘却大節凜然，在美娘手刃蔡如葡後，也斷舌噴血而亡。</p>
<p>看周信芳「明末遺恨」的時候，覺得一代帝王，如此下塲而令人流淚，但讀碧血花葛嫩娘斷舌駡賊，及孫克咸之從容就義，就使人祇有憤恨！正如葛嫩娘所說：一這是血債！」</p>
<h3 id="c98">三大公司的代價劵 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>自從分幣券發出後，電車公司的代價券巳在逐漸收回，有信用的幾家大商店也多在收回發出的代價券，但是三大公司的代價劵也像　車公司的代價券一樣，流落在外面的很多，而且都是些小販。他們券上是註明着只好購貨，不能兌現的，不過那些小販是永遠沒有機會踏上公司的大門的，所以這兩天時常有小販去向公司交涉，希望他們能夠兌現，「新新」和「大新」體卹他們的苦衷，現規定每日上午准一般小販在指定的地方兌現。「先施」還沒有表示，大概也能採用兌現這方法的。「永安」始終沒有發行過代價券，據說他們會經一塊錢七十分，八十分的收着分幣，來作為另找之用。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排塲</p>
<p>朱愛人唯唯的答應了。因此老　醫師又吩咐她：「你到了上海，看事行事，不必為着這裹的事，急急的趕着星期一，定要回來。醫院　嬰院的事，我們自會料理，你儘管放心。即使在上海多住一二星期，也無妨礙。倘有要緊的事，可以打電話通知你。能邀着蘇埋雅太太一同來，自然最好。」平期六的下午，依然坐了朱愛人的汽車，到蘇州來了。這幾天，秋高氣爽，正是丹柱飄香的時候。何家姊妹，見路上有些鄉民，用小手　，推着一簍簍的，裹面都是些新鮮栗子。何家姊妹，生長都市，對於農村產物，他們不大仔細。但到了秋犬，市上的糖炒栗十之類，她們倒是常吃的。便問道：「愛人姊！這不是新鮮栗子嗎？我們只知道天津來的良鄉栗子，全國所聞名的，難道這裏也產栗子嗎？」朱愛人道：「南方也產栗子，不僅是北方。當初在我們小時節，也只知道吃良鄉栗子。良鄉是河北省一個縣名，說是良鄉所產的栗子，顆子很小，其味既糯且甜。後來纔知道北方產栗子的地方，不獨是良鄉，良鄉鄰近的幾縣，也都產栗千。不但是河北，山東有幾處也都產栗子，而且有幾縣所產的栗子，比了良鄉史好。然而人家只知道良鄉產名栗，別地方的栗子，也喚做良鄉栗子了。後來在戰爭之際，良鄉一縣淪陷了，似乎南方將不能吃到良鄉栗子。但栗子上市時，他們牌子上，仍舊寫着良鄉兩字，使人不免發生感喟。其實有許多不是良鄉所產，其味却也不輸於良鄉。說也奇怪，有人把我們栗子的名種，移到他本國去，產出栗子來，却仍舊不及我們的。這是什麼講究呢？有人說是土壤使然，有人說是氣候使然，這個我可不明白，因為我不是園藝果實家。」何儷玉道：「好了！我們問了你一句話，却引了你一篇栗子子來。我們不過是圭問你，蘇州是不是也出栗子？」朱愛人道：「實在我不十分明白，據我想：現在桂花栗子上市，這大既是常熟來的吧？我知道常熟地方，出一種桂花栗子，其味不輸於北方良鄉栗子，其形也很小，既甜且糯，而允其勝於北方栗的，啖之有一種桂花香，所以稱之為桂花栗子。」</p>

<h3 id="c101">所望於話劇聯者 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>本巿職業話劇界，最近要組織一個話劇聯合會，此會由顧夢鶴。陳秋風·董天民。張四維·張冶兒·李竹菴等發起，現正在積極籌備中。</p>
<p>要組織話劇聯，主要的原因，就在鑒於近來本市新興的劇團，時常有得聽見，而成立之後，不久就會解散，他們底組織是多麼不健全啊，這裹就需要一個團體來聯繫着，以彌補缺憾。</p>
<p>的確，一個劇團的成立，主要的一點就在組織要健全，吾則，再也不會持久而能有相當的成績的。因此，我們對於職業話劇界的組織話劇聯以為有相當的意義。</p>
<p>而且進一步，除了希望話劇界的組織健全而外，更望每一個職業話劇團體，能夠認識話劇界所應負的使命。大家能夠使話劇進步，切勿為迎合低級興趣起見，使話劇還是不能脫離文明戲的範疇，甚至在開倒車。</p>
<p>最後，我們覺得上海各劇團的上演話劇，近來座價方面，也未免定得太貴。座價一高，就不能普遍，使好多愛看話劇的人，為了座價問題，不能去看了。關於這點，職　話劇界也不能不顧到的吧？</p>
<h3 id="c102">悄然來滬的「中旅」台柱　唐若靑女士會見記 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 貝尼</p>
<p>唐若靑來滬的消息，最初沒有人相信，因為大家都知道她已應南洋華僑之聘，出國演劇去了；然而却料不到她已悄悄然到上海有兩個星期之久了！</p>
<p>記者為了要得到些香港劇壇的消息，同時又相會見這離開上海兩年多的劇人，於是就在一個秋雨連綿的下午到上海劇藝社去訪問她，承她回答了很多孤島人士所不知道的消息，和她個人最近的情形，茲記之如下：</p>
<p>我（唐自稱）在香港最後演出的一個戲是于伶先生的「女子公寓」，那是為籌募災款的演出，地點是「皇后戲院」，演出的劇本是由夏衍先生就香港的情形經過一番改寫的，我演柳麗珠一角，導演是費穆先生，一般的情形都很好；演完一女子公寓」後我就被邀南下。常時歐洲風雲業已緊急，我動身到海防即被阻止，只好重回香港，那時我的妹妹湘靑要回上海來念書，要我陪她到上海來，正好我也有些事要到上海來料理一下，於是決定陪她到上海來走一趟，本來不想給任何人知道，那知一到上海，就給幾個熟朋友發現並邀我在上海客串演出。</p>
<p>「明末遺恨」是魏如晦先生最近才寫好的一部歷史劇，當我到上海的第三天就碰到了魏先生，魏先生說：「上海劇藝社」最近要演出這個戲，可是戲中的葛嫩娘一角還是缺着，定耍找我來演，但是我本不打算在上海演戲的，然而在魏先生和上海劇藝社的幾位負責人的堅邀之下，盛情難却，無法推辭，於是我就答應下來。我化了一天的時間把劇本整個的讀了一遍，覺得劇本的意義和技術都很好。這戲的導演是吳永剛先生，這次我和吳先生還是第一次合作哩：</p>
<p>「明末遺恨」現在早經開始排演了，定廿五日上演。</p>
<p>至於我今後的計劃，實在也說小上來，不過在「明末遺恨」後，就預備離開上海回香港，一方面妹妹在上海念書的事辦妥了，另外有一些雜務也可以結束。長談一小時之久，記者便匆匆吿辭。</p>
<h3 id="c103">記虞府堂會 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>昨天虞洽卿君之文孫，假新都飯店結婚，有盛大堂會。因為參加堂會的，都是各戲院的「頭路角色」，所以相當的轟動，面積不很大的一座新都劇塲，擠得水洩不通。</p>
<p>天蟾舞台的角兒，最早登台，劉漢臣雪又琴高雪樵等人，唱完「龍鳳呈祥」以後，才趕到天蟾去唱戲。可是「龍鳳呈祥」完後，本來楚筱玲紅的「拾玉鐲」，然而筱玲紅因為黃金方面的公事未畢，以致不能準時到塲，而在無可奈何之下，墊起戲來，一共墊了兩齣小花臉的戲，一齣是劉斌崑韓金奎的「打沙鍋」，一齣是韓金奎的「送親演禮」。</p>
<p>晚飯以後，「捉於曹」繼之上塲，趙培鑫君的陳宮，在其俊君的呂伯奢，虞府堂會中參加表演的，都是內行，票友只有趙在二位，趙君嗓音日漸嘹亮，佳腔百出，悅耳動聽，內行不能及也。汪君近巳不專工麒派，飾呂伯奢，雖處配角地位，但輕描淡寫，恰到好處，究屬老手，演來能不同凡俗也。配以李克昌之曹操，更覺錦上添花。</p>
<p>「捉放曹」後。為三位坤旦主演之傑作，計為吳素秋之「春香鬧學」，小玲紅之「拾玉鐲一，張淑嫻之「辛安驛」，素伙扮相秀麗，飾春香做表均極佳妙，台下人仕對素秋之藝，亦無不欽賞。「春查鬧學」後，為小玲紅之「拾玉鐲」，小玲紅之扮相奇美，能驚四座，要亦佳麗，雖名聲地位不及素秋，但其演出之佳妙，則並不遜於素秋也。蓋三省之劉媒婆，特別「卵上」。身段多不勝計，妙到秋毫。「拾玉鐲」後為張淑嫻之「辛安驛」，以張在舞台之戲尚未完畢，不克趕到，「拾玉鐲」因而「馬後」，竟演至九刻之久。張淑嫻由津來滬未久，觀其演「辛安驛」，可知藝術具相當根底，非庸碌之輩也。淑嫻扮相稍差，武工頗有可取，身段驕工亦佳，且善做戲，不失為一中駟之才也。</p>
<p>堂會中最引人入勝者，允推麒麟童趙如泉袁世海之「戰長沙」、信芳如泉為南方伶人之巨頭，兩雄相遇，不特棋逢對手，加以世海之架子花臉，素負佳譽，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰，是夕之「從頭　起」，三人無不賣力，台下掌聲如雷。虞洽卿君坐台上一隅連聲喝彩，其精彩不言可喻。大軸為宋德珠之「水漫金山寺」，德珠之看家戲也，與戰長沙路數不同，各有所長，戲散巳黎明四時矣。</p>

<p>— 却利</p>
<p>喧傳已久的大華影院，已定　一月二十二日開幕，而在下月十日以前將建築工程加工完成。因該院和米高梅訂有長期合同，所以今後將專映米高梅的新片，目前積存着的已有二十部之多，預備依次放映。開幕第一砲是珍妮麥唐娜的歌唱片「情王歌侶」“Broadway　Serenade”。接着放映的是三百萬金的五彩偉搆“The　Wizard　of　Oz”（裘蒂迦綸主演）。至於克拉克蓋博，李思廉霍華，奧麗薇哈茀蘭，費雯莉通力合作的「隨風而去」（“Gone　With　The　Wind”），的在本年年底放映，而轟動已久的文藝鉅片“Goodbye.　Mr.　Chips”（勞勃杜奈不朽作）則須在三月後方可到滬云。</p>
<p>鐵馬前奏</p>
<p>「鐵馬」一片是派拉蒙西席地密爾第五十六部傑作，這一部片子，具有相當的歷史與教育價值，據說以前中國運往美國東部的茶葉，須由南美洲轉道，後來UnionPaeifie鐵道造成，就可由西部直達東部，林肯總統向來簽字，都用A.　Lincoin在核准這一條鐵路的時候，特簽一個完全的姓名Abraham　Lincoin足見他重視鐵道之一斑，上圖為鐵馬中的三個主角。（保羅）</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>烏龍院劇中的金銀問題</p>
<p>但是還有許多都是音同字不同的字，那就頗費一番猜測，卽如上邊的第二句，按照原意乃是拾得一些鷄毛去拼凑成一個鷄毛撣子，然而這話出在一位飯桶教師爺的口中，同時他又曉得他所帶的幾個打手徒弟比他自個還要飯桶，故而雖是帶着一夥人去捉蕭恩，也無非是凑凑膽（撣）子而已。同樣在「烏龍院」劇裹，宋德珠（飾惜姣）那天也和宋三爺調了一個坎，當宋江向惜妓討招文袋裹的黃金時，德珠接唸「老太大下台階，存（蹲）啦。」這話又是句歇後語，照辭意來講，因為老太太是有年紀的人，骨節硬了，腳手都不靈活，當下台階時，一隻腳在上，一隻腳在下，要是稍微慌了一點，往往就會蹲了腰，义了氣，因此旦行人就採取「存」蹲」同音的意思，作為答復生角的詞，說是那錠黃金呌我存啦。　實按照老詞，乃為「黃金我收下了」德珠這齣戲要是學的翠花，那末，這句詞恐怕也就是依着翠花的原詞唸的啦。我的意思，後進學前輩，固是應當，不過自己也得先判斷一下，何者當學，何者切不可學，總得把劇情揣摩透澈，再加取捨。德珠是學校出身的，知識常然高於普通伶工，就拿上邊我所說的「他偏改唸道，一錠銀子，留着給三郎買糖吃」。其實他沒想想，眞個的　惜姣連金子銀子都分辨不淸麼？考其用意，無非是始作俑者，又想添個俏頭，要說拿一錠金子買糖，未免不合，故而才把黃金貶價，改成銀子了。（一二六）</p>

The Japanese launched a fierce but empty attack, and their conspiracy completely failed. The Japanese troops occupying Sanjiangkou and Lichengqiao (north of Shun'an) were completely repelled by the Chinese on the 15th. The Japanese suffered considerable casualties in this battle.

<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers carried a dispatch from Hong Kong saying that Mao Zedong, a member of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recently published an important article on policy in the Communist Party organ Xinhua Daily in Chongqing. The article, entitled "The New Situation in the War of Resistance and the Chinese Communist Party," both spoke of the need to resist Japan and prevent internal friction, and advocated a unified national front.

<p>Chongqing: Chinese sources here welcome the rumors that the Soviet government has denied making demands on China. It is believed that since this denial comes from Moscow, its effect in dispelling rumors will far exceed any statement issued here. This morning, all Chinese newspapers prominently published the news of the Soviet denial. It is expected that Kuomintang Secretary-General Zhu Jiahua will make a statement on the matter today. The Shishi Xinbao published an editorial today commenting on the matter, saying that the only effective way for China to prevent such rumors is to continue the war of resistance, because this is the only way to defeat the Japanese plan.

American churches in various parts of North China have been repeatedly harassed recently. For example, the incident in Chenliu in which rioters invaded an American church, smashed windows, and forced Chinese people to withdraw is one proof of this. Therefore, many people now believe that the clamor that began with the anti-British political movement is gradually becoming a Japanese movement against Christianity. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Miluo: In this Battle of Northern Hunan, although the officers and soldiers of the Chinese armies had different successes and sacrifices due to different circumstances, their composure and courage in combat, advancing without retreating, are the most important factors in achieving this epoch-making victory. There are two praiseworthy and moving events: (1) The Japanese attacked the Chinese army's Bijiashan on the north bank of the Xinqiang River. Battalion Commander Shi Enhua, who was defending the area, held out independently for three days with a battalion of troops. The Japanese concentrated more than ten planes, more than 30 artillery pieces, and a regiment of infantry and cavalry, and launched a fierce attack for eight hours. The Chinese position did not move at all. The next day, the Japanese army attacked again with all its strength. Shi immediately went to the front line to supervise the battle. When the soldiers heard that the battalion commander had arrived, they all fought bravely, with each one equaling ten. At about 6:00 PM, Shi was wounded in the shoulder by a Japanese machine gun bullet. The regimental commander ordered him to retreat for treatment, but Shi refused to go down, fearing that it would damage morale and the position would be lost. At that time, the division commander told him that if it was absolutely necessary, he could withdraw his troops. Shi replied, "Report to the division commander, I will never have a time of absolute necessity," and continued to fight, bandaging his wound and commanding the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion. Only Company Commander Yi Ping and Qu Wensheng had already been killed, and Company Commanders Yan Ganxi and Wang Kuishan were seriously wounded. The so-called entire battalion was actually only two platoon leaders and more than 40 soldiers. At this point, Shi ordered the entire army to sing the March of the Volunteers, which boosted morale even more. The Japanese army launched twelve attacks, all of which failed. They retreated and then used artillery to bombard the Chinese positions, with shells raining down like a storm. Battalion Commander Shi finally died in battle. Shi loved the people like his own children in peacetime. After the Japanese troops retreated, the residents respected his loyalty and integrity and raised money to bury him in ××, writing "Tomb of Chinese Battalion Commander Shi." (2) Company Commander Chen Huiqun was ordered to ambush the Japanese troops between Fulinpu and Shangshan. He ambushed his unit in ×× and fought the Japanese back and forth for days, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. While they were excitedly cleaning the battlefield and collecting spoils, more than 200 Japanese cavalrymen suddenly sneaked up. The company was caught off guard. The troops were densely packed and unable to disperse at once, so they engaged in a melee for three hours. After killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers, all of them died heroically. The only survivor of the Chinese army was Private Zhang Zhong. When he met the reporter, he recounted the heroic battle of Company Commander Chen, with tears still streaming down his face.

<p>Chongqing: According to news received here, the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama arrived in Lhasa on the 7th of this month, leading a large entourage and his parents and family. He was discovered in the Kokonor area at the beginning of this year. He will now live permanently in Lhasa. The enthronement ceremony, originally scheduled for mid-November, has now been postponed because Wu Zhongxin, the chief Chinese representative and chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, will not be able to arrive on time, and Tibet considers Wu's attendance to be extremely important. (24th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here from Lhasa, although winter travel in Tibet is extremely difficult, due to the Dalai Lama's imminent enthronement, people from all parts of Tibet, Mongolia, and Nepal are flocking to Lhasa to attend the ceremony. Due to the lack of accommodation in hostels along the way, countless people are living in tents, braving the wind and snow. (24th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Associated Press Reporter Inspects the Battle Achievements in Northern Hunan The Japanese Army of 180,000 Collapsed The Victory Belongs to the Chinese Side After Failing at the Last Hurdle <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Changsha: In the past four days, the reporter has traveled through an area 40 miles long and 10 miles wide, which runs parallel to the Wu-Chang Highway. On September 30, the Japanese army was surrounded by the superior forces of the Chinese army in a swift and unexpected manner. In this area, the Japanese army mobilized 180,000 troops in this attack on Changsha, but the severe blow it suffered was the worst this time. In this battle, the Japanese mobilized the 5th and 13th Divisions on the front of the Wu-Chang Line, the 33rd Division advanced along the highway, and the 106th and 101st Divisions protected the left flank, while preparing to advance rapidly southwestward from Fengxin and Nanchang to outflank the Chinese army. However, in this area, the mountains are undulating, and the Chinese army is very capable of making planned retreats, and then launching surprise attacks on each route of the Japanese army with lightning speed. Therefore, the Japanese army failed at the last hurdle, and the victory ultimately belonged to the Chinese side. Furthermore, the peaks in the northern Hunan area can not only make the Japanese lost, but even the Chinese soldiers who are familiar with this place often get lost in the mountains. For example, our party hired several guides who were familiar with the geography of this area, but on one day, we got lost twice in the mountains of Fulinpu. In addition to this, there are countless valleys here, which can accommodate at least a division of troops. Therefore, the Chinese side made full use of this advantageous terrain. At the same time, the people in the villages and towns where the Japanese army was stationed had moved their food, and the Chinese army controlled the high ground, attacking the Japanese army from above without stopping. In addition, the traffic on all the highways was completely destroyed by the Chinese, so the Japanese heavy artillery, tanks, and mechanized equipment could not be brought in and used, and they lost contact with other troops. Moreover, because they could not get food, they lost their way, and the attacks of the Chinese army became more and more fierce. Therefore, the Japanese army had no choice but to retreat. Guan Linzheng, commander of the 52nd Army, had already achieved military success in Taierzhuang and is now leading the army to defend this area. Guan is 33 years old and is the youngest of the Chinese army commanders. According to General Guan, the Japanese army's retreat this time was a complete collapse. The Japanese army's retreat began on October 1, but the order for the entire army to retreat was not issued until October 5, when the Japanese Commander-in-Chief commanding the battle in Xinshi, Miluo River, returned to Yuezhou. Little did he know that in fact, when this order was issued, the Chinese army had not only recovered the original positions along the Xinqiang River, but also advanced six miles to the north, deep into the rear of the original Japanese line. Now the Japanese army in Yuezhou is transporting military supplies to the north, and the Bailuoji Airport east of Yuezhou is also ready to be destroyed at any time, which shows that the Japanese army in Yuezhou is planning to withdraw. Jinjing is the place where the Chinese army opened a gap to lure the Japanese army to attack south. The reporter also went to inspect the place. When the Chinese army lured the Japanese army to advance, they secretly retreated to the mountains in the east. There are now graves of 500 Japanese soldiers on the hillside. Of the original 9,000 residents, 500 have returned here. In the Fulinpu area, the Japanese army was ambushed by the Chinese army, and the trees and rocks are covered with bullet marks, which is evident. According to the residents here, when the Japanese army collapsed, they threw their military uniforms, ammunition, and weapons into the river, searched for civilian clothes, disguised themselves as Chinese civilians, and fled in panic. Jinshan City is the most forward point reached by the Japanese army. According to a man in his forties here, the Japanese army captured him and asked him for food and inquired about the location of the Chinese army. Later, when the Japanese army interrogated others, he escaped into the mountains. According to another reporter, four women in the family of a Chinese doctor named Li in Malinqiao were raped by Japanese soldiers, and their son-in-law came forward to intervene and was killed by Japanese soldiers and thrown into the pond. The whole family, except for an old grandmother, jumped into the pond and committed suicide. According to a reporter from a certain inn, three women in his family were raped by Japanese soldiers and then brutally killed. According to reporters from civilians in various places, Chinese officials had ordered them to flee to the mountains, but after they fled, they also returned to inspect and suspected that the Japanese army was the retreating Chinese army, so they were victimized by the Japanese soldiers. According to a Chinese official, most Hunan people are good old men of the old era and do not believe that the Japanese are so cruel. Driven by curiosity, they wanted to see what the Japanese were like. As for now, they have personally seen the truth, so there are thousands of people who have automatically joined the army to seek revenge and revenge.

<h3 id="e16">Is Japan Regaining Its Sanity? <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Twenty days ago, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in a major battle in northern Hunan, with the Chinese army achieving a great victory; this is a military event in China's War of Resistance worth highlighting. Four days ago, the American ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, issued a frank and severe warning regarding Japan's aggression; this is another international event in China's War of Resistance that is worth highlighting. Both events are well known at home and abroad. Now, there is another event, as reported yesterday by the "Kokumin Shimbun" in Tokyo and transmitted by Reuters; the "Kokumin Shimbun" is known as a mouthpiece of the military. Yesterday it stated as follows:</p>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, 24th) The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated today that, "Now is the time to finally resolve all domestic and political issues since the Mukden Incident. Future developments are noteworthy. Political parties have been unusually busy recently, and the general impression is that 'the China Incident can now be considered nearing its end.' The power of opposing parties has weakened under the pressure of the political situation, so political parties should be able to regain power. At the same time, the Abe cabinet is weak and powerless. Senior statesmen close to the Emperor now hold the view that the current transitional cabinet is gradually reaching the extreme of its existence, and that the emergence of a political party cabinet should be possible in the near future." The "Kokumin Shimbun" also stated that, "Since the China Incident is nearing its end, international diplomatic pressure will become stronger and domestic economic difficulties will become even greater. Therefore, only a cabinet that can gain national support can overcome this difficult situation."</p>
<p>This is the latest report on the internal situation in Japan related to China's War of Resistance. Given the strictness of Japanese news censorship and the standing of the "Kokumin Shimbun," we cannot but believe in the accuracy of this report. If this is accurate, it is worth highlighting, and can be considered on par with the great victory in northern Hunan and the American warning. All three are absolutely beneficial to China, which goes without saying. However, it is not an unexpected development, nor a lucky gain, but merely confirms the accuracy of the various views and judgments held by China and its sympathizers regarding the War of Resistance over the past two or three years.</p>
<p>Favorable facts and circumstances for China are continuously emerging, appearing one by one before our eyes. Who can restrain their extraordinary delight? However, in terms of the overall situation and future of Sino-Japanese relations, there are still divergent paths awaiting Japan's choice. While we are delighted, we should still remain calm and carefully observe. Why do we say this? If Japan continues its aggression until a complete victory or defeat, then the coming years will merely be an extension of the mutual struggle and killing of the past two or three years. This is one path. If Japan abandons its aggression and seeks complete peace, then a sudden and bright turn should be seen within the next two or three months. This is another path. According to the former scenario, China has no choice but to continue the War of Resistance. As for the inevitable protractedness of the war, the inevitable painful sacrifices, and the inevitable suffering of coastal and riverine areas in the early stages of the war due to inferior military equipment, we knew this before the war, we saw it clearly, understood it deeply, and stated it publicly before resolving to resist. What we believe in is the later stages of military strength, the advantages of inland terrain, the potential of our people, justice, fairness, and international sympathy and assistance to win the final victory. According to the latter scenario, China only wants Sino-Japanese equality, only wants to maintain independence, and only wants the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration. Under these political principles, China is a great market with abundant resources, and it can be said that Japan and any other country cooperating with its capital and talent is a natural state that adapts to the principles of economic supply and demand. There is no need to say welcome, but it is not a surrender under the city walls! Before 1918, before the so-called Mukden Incident, China suspected Japan's hidden intentions and dared not speak lightly of cooperation. Now, there is no need to discuss Japan's intentions in the past, but Japan's aggression from the 1918 incident to the present has proven China's suspicions to be correct. Eight years of militarism, two years of bloody war, both have paid a great price, and whether they will recognize, live in peace, be good, and cooperate with each other from now on depends solely on whether Japan has regained its sanity.</p>
<p>The victory in northern Hunan is not yet a decisive war, but it should help Japan regain its sanity, as it should know that continued aggression is hopeless in military terms. The American warning is not yet the implementation of strong pressure, but it should also help Japan regain its sanity, as it should know that continued aggression is not tolerated by the international community. Military hopelessness is like this, international intolerance is like that; must we wait until the days are longer, the soldiers are older, defeated again and again until a disastrous defeat is beyond recovery, and then it will be over? Must we wait until the United States' so-called visible policies and actions are fully implemented and there is no room left, and then it will be over? Japan should not be so foolish. And yesterday's political brewing recorded by the "Kokumin Shimbun," as well as the so-called "China Incident is nearing its end, international diplomatic pressure will become stronger, and domestic economic difficulties will become even greater," such feelings, such confessions, we are happy to regard as a sign that Japan is gradually regaining its sanity. What remains to be examined is: what does their so-called "China Incident is nearing its end" mean? To this day, we have seen all kinds of proposals and actions by Japan other than military ones, not only is none of them expected to end this incident, but also none of them is expected to end this war! It is important to know that the state of war must end with the period of Japanese troops staying in China; and the end of the incident must wait for the establishment of equal, independent, and complete political principles! Before the military has not suffered a disastrous defeat beyond recovery, and before international pressure has not been fully implemented, it is the best and last opportunity for Japan to "resolve its domestic political situation," to sincerely face the Chinese government, and to seek a solution to the dispute. A sudden change of course will lead to a sudden turnaround, and a frank confession will lead to a bright future.</p>

<p>Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. The Japanese cabinet held a meeting this morning and decided to decouple the Japanese yen from the British pound sterling and join the US dollar. The Ministry of Finance issued a statement saying that this decision was entirely due to economic factors and was not intended to change Japan's commercial policy. Previously, the Japanese yen was linked to the British pound sterling at a rate of one yen to one shilling and two pence. However, after the outbreak of the war, the British government has been strengthening its control over foreign exchange in order to prevent the war from prolonging. Therefore, in order to facilitate the movement of Japanese funds abroad, the Japanese government decided to change the Japanese yen to be linked to the US dollar. As for the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the US dollar, it is based on the latest market conditions. According to the decision made by the foreign exchange banking community in today's meeting, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen will be set at 23 and 16/7 US dollars per 100 yen. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Japanese government decided in today's meeting to change the exchange rate standard of one shilling and two pence against the British pound sterling. The Ministry of Finance announced it immediately as follows, and announced that it would be implemented from October 25th. The exchange rate of Japanese currency has always been based on the British pound sterling, with a prescribed rate of one shilling and two pence. However, Britain is now gradually strengthening its foreign exchange purchase policy due to the outbreak of war in order to prepare for a long-term war. Therefore, in order to facilitate the operation of overseas funds, Japan decided to change the exchange rate standard to the US dollar. At the time of this change, regarding the question of how to prescribe the Japanese exchange rate, considering the impact on foreign trade and other aspects, in order to avoid drastic changes, it was decided to use the recent exchange rate as the base. As a result of today's consultation with banks, it was agreed to use the telegraphic transfer rate of 23 and 16/7 US dollars as the base exchange rate. It goes without saying that this change is entirely due to economic reasons and is not based on changing Japan's commercial policy. (24th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. After the Japanese exchange rate standard was changed to the US dollar, Yūtarō Yūki, Governor of the Bank of Japan, issued a statement saying that Japan's exchange rate policy has always maintained the exchange rate of one shilling and two pence against the British pound sterling, in order to stabilize the external value of the yen and have a good impact on trade and the general economic community. However, since the end of August, the situation in Europe has been tense, and the British pound sterling has been shaken. Its exchange rate against the US dollar has fallen from 4.68 dollars to 3.82 dollars. The exchange rate against the US dollar calculated by Japan at the rate of one shilling and two pence against the British pound sterling has also fallen sharply. Therefore, the exchange rate against the US dollar was temporarily fixed as an urgent measure. After that, the method of calculating the exchange rate against the US dollar based on the official exchange rate of the Bank of England was adopted until today. During this period, Britain gradually strengthened the application of foreign exchange management as the war progressed. Japan considered its impact on the domestic financial community, and then changed the exchange rate standard from the British pound sterling to the US dollar. This is the most appropriate method.

<h3 id="e19">Overseas Chinese Enthusiasm and Eagerly Donate Funds <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing. The "Sing Tao Daily," "Sing Chong Daily," and "Penang Sin Pin Daily" newspapers founded by Mr. Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman in Singapore, specially sent reporter Li Bingren back to China to observe the war resistance construction projects in the southwest and northwest provinces of the motherland. Li arrived in Chongqing a few days ago and will soon travel to the northwest provinces. According to Li, he was deeply moved by the various construction projects in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, which are flourishing like bamboo shoots after the rain. He has reported the results of his observation in detail to overseas Chinese compatriots in order to enhance their belief in the final victory. Li also said that overseas Chinese compatriots are extremely enthusiastic in supporting the country. In terms of donating money alone, they have now created a trend of donating money in competition. In addition to each person donating a regular monthly donation, various commemorative days are also used to raise special donations from various groups. This time, the Wuhan Choir's fundraising performance in Malaya sold tickets for 800,000 national currency in Johor, 500,000 in Malacca, and 500,000 in Negeri Sembilan. The performance in Selangor is currently underway, and the estimated result will be at least 1.5 million yuan. In the future, after traveling through Pahang, Perak, Penang, etc., at least 6 million yuan in national currency can be raised. Among those who bought the most tickets, the labor community is Mr. Liu Guoqi, a dock worker in Muar, Johor, who bought 1,000 yuan worth of tickets. Another female nurse, Miss Lin, in Malacca also bought 1,000 yuan worth of tickets. Among the capitalists who bought the most tickets, Mr. Chen Yong of Kuala Lumpur reached 250,000 national currency. From this alone, we can get a glimpse of the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese compatriots. In order to make money donations universal, Malayan Chinese have established a fundraising general association in each of the twelve districts of Singapore, Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Perlis, Perak, Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, and Penang since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Under the general association, there are numerous branch associations. All the above-mentioned general associations are subordinate to the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fundraising General Association. According to Li, this visit to the northwest will last for two months, and then he will go to the southwest provinces and return to Singapore via Hong Kong. (24th dispatch)</p>

<p>Hong Kong. The Swire Shipping Company's "Foshan," carrying 1,500 passengers (including 40 foreigners), left Hong Kong for Guangzhou at 8:00 this morning. At about 10:00, when it reached the waters of Linting Island, the bottom of the ship suddenly hit something, seemingly a mine. The ship immediately showed signs of sinking. However, the area happened to be the shallow waters of Linting Island, so the ship ran aground and did not sink. Therefore, all passengers were safe. Some of the passengers have already landed on Linting Island, while others remain on the ship, waiting for ships from Hong Kong to come to the rescue. (Associated Press, 24th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">If Japan Does Not Change Its Policy, the United States Is Prepared to Take Further Action; Grew's Frank Remarks Are Praised at Home; Using Economic Weapons Will Surely Force Japan to Submit <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Washington. Well-informed sources claimed last night that the frank warning issued by US Ambassador to Japan Grew in Tokyo last week was only the first step in the United States' strong stance against Japan's seizure of US rights and interests in China. The US government does not intend to hastily reveal the "behind-the-scenes" reasons for Ambassador Grew's unprecedented speech before thoroughly studying Japan's response to the US ambassador's warning. What is considered meaningful here is that although State Department officials said that Grew's speech only expressed his personal opinions, the government did not express disagreement with his speech. Even isolationist senators in the Senate did not disagree with Grew's warning that the American people oppose Japan's "New Order in East Asia" and that only when Japan changes its Eastern policy can the tense US-Japan relationship be improved. Congressional leaders endorsed decisive action against Japan and yesterday reiterated the restoration of the ban on arms exports to Japan and other punitive measures to sanction Japan. Washington officials doubt that Japan can change its policy as a result of Grew's speech.</p>
<h3 id="e25">The United States Has an Absolute Advantage in Negotiations with Japan <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The warning issued by Grew represents the views of President Roosevelt and was tacitly approved by officials in advance without any objection. In addition to waiting for the outcome of Grew's speech, the United States is prepared to use "more pleasing methods" to force Japan to give better treatment to American people and interests in Japanese-occupied areas in China. Observers here with access to information acknowledge that the State Department has reviewed the crisis between the United States and Japan in the past two weeks. They feel that the United States now has a better "bargaining" position with Japan than it did several weeks ago. Everyone agrees. It is generally believed that the United States is currently in a position to bargain with Japan alone. The change in Japan's position is due to the bankruptcy of the anti-communist public, which has led to Japan's diplomatic isolation.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Now That the European War Has Broken Out, There Is No More Concern <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>In addition, it is widely believed that President Roosevelt's restrictive actions against Japan before the outbreak of the European war were deeply concerned that the US-Japan crisis in the Pacific would prompt Chancellor Hitler to launch an early attack in Europe. Observers believe that now that the European war has broken out and the hopes of mediation have decreased, the United States does not have to worry about other serious problems in Europe and can take a more resolute attitude towards the Far East. It is generally believed that the United States' threat to ban the export of American raw materials that can be turned into military use to Japan will not only make Tokyo extremely concerned, but also improve the United States' bargaining position with Japan. Senator Hugh Mitchell of Washington State, a Democrat and the drafter of the proposal to ban the export of raw materials to Japan, said yesterday that he intends to promote the bill when the next Congress convenes in January, and at that time the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which has been announced by the United States to be terminated, will also expire. Senators and Representatives who proposed the same bill indicated that they will re-launch the bill in January. Senator Vandenberg of Michigan, a Republican and a possible candidate for the 1940 Republican presidential election, declined yesterday to criticize whether he would propose convening a Peking Conference to discuss Japan's repeated violations of the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Economic Pressure Is Enough to Kill Japan <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Congressional reaction to Grew's nationwide speech in Japan last week against Japan's policies in China was "almost" universal. Observers here believe that the State Department may take "more pleasing methods" to control Japan. The initial work will be economic. It is generally recalled that US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, told reporters in Shanghai that under the current circumstances, it is impossible for the United States and Japan to negotiate a new treaty of commerce and navigation to replace the old 1911 treaty, which expires in January. It is believed here that Sayre's message is meaningful, as he held an important position in the State Department before being appointed to his position in Manila. Observers here view Japan's initial response to Grew's warning as largely unyielding, and that attitude will prompt the State Department to adopt direct methods to make the Japanese government and people understand the new policy of the United States in the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e28">New Characteristics of the US Far East Policy <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>It is indicated here that yesterday's statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson was actually an attack on the reason of the American people, rather than a response to Grew's accusation that the Japanese authorities often attack American rights and interests in China and cause resentment and the danger of being bombed by the American people. Sources here with access to information solemnly stated that the policy currently adopted by the United States in the Far East has no special features. Several of them have been conveyed to the Japanese authorities as early as two years ago. The new feature of the policy is that the US government has decided to take "more effective methods" to maintain the US position in the Far East if Japan continues to ignore US rights and interests in the US.

<p>Washington. Japanese newspapers reported that Foreign Minister Nomura will hold talks with US Ambassador to Japan Grew to study the possibility of concluding a new commercial treaty.

<p>Peking. The spokesperson for the Japanese army here has refused to criticize US Ambassador to Japan Grew's frank speech denouncing the actions of the Japanese army in China for several days, but today finally issued a sour and sarcastic criticism. According to the official view of the Japanese army, Grew's frankness is commendable, but the Japanese army expects more than that. In this speech, the Japanese army has not found that Grew, in his capacity as ambassador to Japan, has conveyed the views of the Japanese people to the American government and public. The Japanese army's request for Grew to take this action may not be excessive. The destruction of the rights and property of American residents in China was not done intentionally. The situation in the war does not allow for the prevention of all conflicts between American interests and the activities of the Japanese army, but the Japanese army is determined to respect these rights as its policy. When asked whether the Japanese economic blockade in China is consistent with this policy, the spokesperson replied that the United Kingdom first established an economic bloc to oppose Japanese exports. Japan must live, so it began to take action in China. (Reuters, 24th dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: According to an announcement here today, Japanese Ambassador to Belgium, Saburo Kurusu, has been appointed as the new Ambassador to Germany, with the approval of the German government. As for General Oshima, who has already been recalled to Japan, he is scheduled to leave Berlin for Italy on the 28th of this month, traveling by ship via the United States to return home. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, along with Oshima and Kurusu, have met in Berlin to discuss the future of Japan's European policy, which must be approached with great caution in order to adapt to the ever-changing situation and avoid repeating past mistakes. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Ambassador Oshima, in view of his imminent return to Japan, specially convened a meeting in Berlin from the 21st with his successor as Ambassador to Germany, Kurusu, and the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, lasting until the 22nd, for two days of important discussions regarding Japan's future European policy. The following is a general outline of the opinions presented by the three ambassadors at the meeting:</p>
<p>(1) To predict how much benefit Japan might gain from the outbreak of a European war; however, the development of the situation may not allow for such optimism. (2) It is extremely dangerous to establish such a strategy if the European conflict continues to develop into a long-term war. That is, to anticipate a sudden shift in the situation leading to peace, in which case Britain will inevitably take advantage of this short-term truce to once again suppress the Far East. (3) The relationship between Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union is extremely delicate. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate that the situation may suddenly change, altering the current state of European politics. Thus, Japan's European policy should consider adapting to the handling of the China Incident. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, has gone to Berlin to treat a dental ailment and is scheduled to return here on the 27th of this month. According to well-informed sources, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan regarding the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border issue will continue after Ambassador Togo returns to his post. Negotiations regarding the demarcation of the border have been temporarily suspended due to the unresolved issue of exchanging prisoners of war. The Soviet side demands that, in addition to the officers and soldiers of the Red Army captured in the Nomonhan region, all those previously captured by the Japanese side, including several Soviet pilots who strayed into "Manchurian" territory, should also be returned to the Soviet Union. The Japanese side is unwilling to treat these two matters as one, hence the unresolved dispute. According to the principle of equality in the exchange method, it can be seen that the Soviet Union captured more prisoners in the Nomonhan region than the Japanese side captured Red Army officers and soldiers.

Upon reaching the Romanian border, it was transferred to special trains and transported to the port of Constanta, where it was loaded onto a Turkish ship and transported via the Black Sea to that country. Shortly after the ship set sail, the German government informed the Romanian government that if it allowed the gold to pass through its territory without interference, it would be considered an unfriendly act, but it was too late.

<p>London: According to well-informed sources here, Germany is currently experiencing a severe shortage of raw materials and food. Domestic production cannot be expanded, and public spending is bound to increase. The only options at this point are currency inflation or further reductions in consumption. The raw materials held by Germany abroad are worth at most 800,000,000 marks, only one-tenth of the reserves in 1914. Germany has no foreign exchange, and its foreign currency reserves have been exhausted. Its ability to borrow has been zero for years. Future supplies depend entirely on production and exports. Although the reserves in German-occupied territories can be seized and used to alleviate the immediate emergency, this approach will damage their future productivity. As for the Soviet Union, it cannot be persuaded by empty words; to purchase Soviet goods, payment must be made in cash. The most lacking food items in Germany are eggs, cream, lard, and vegetable oil. Since 1935, Germany has felt a shortage of oil and fat supplies, which is now even more severe.

<p>— Shu Di</p>
<p>(3) A Review of the Diplomatic Situation Moments Before the War</p>
<p>At around six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday (the 1st), Hitler launched a military attack on Poland. So, has this European war officially begun?</p>
<p>However, the opinions here yesterday and the day before yesterday were not entirely certain. The consensus was that the key to the current situation lay in whether Britain and France would fulfill their mutual assistance agreement with Poland. Therefore, for these two days, the Polish Ambassador to Britain has been sitting in the British Foreign Office almost all day, waiting for a definite answer. The British public has also been mobilizing to urge their government to take swift and decisive action.</p>
<p>However, the first move by the British government was to send an ultimatum to the German government, ordering it to immediately withdraw its troops from Poland; otherwise, Britain would "have no choice but to fulfill its mutual assistance obligations to Poland."</p>
<p>At the time, this measure was absolutely unable to satisfy the wishes of the general public, who were hoping for a direct and, of course, declaration of war against Germany. Therefore, at the meeting of the British Houses of Parliament at six o'clock the day before yesterday, the divide between the government and the members was quite deep. The resolute and clear words spoken by the opposition leaders in the House of Commons, in effect, forced their government to a point where it was difficult to avoid fulfilling its obligations to Poland.</p>
<p>The worst part was that the British and French ultimatum to Germany did not include a time limit for a response! As a result, rumors started circulating again. However, it should be specifically pointed out here that, apart from rumors, there were indeed many concrete diplomatic activities taking place. On one side was a war raging with artillery fire, while on the other, diplomatic contacts were also taking place simultaneously.</p>
<p>As usual, diplomacy comes to a dead end, then war breaks out; once the war begins, diplomatic activity ceases. However, this time it was different. Even during these two days of war between Germany and Poland, Germany and Poland were still in contact through Mussolini. Even before 11:00 a.m. today, the possibility of Poland surrendering to Germany still existed. The precondition for the so-called surrender, of course, was accepting the "sixteen terms" proposed by Germany.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this was a huge crisis! – not just a crisis for Poland; what was even more important was that it was linked to the entire future of the British and French empires!</p>
<p>Now, this crisis has finally passed. At 9:00 a.m. today, Britain and France sent another strong ultimatum to Germany, setting a two-hour time limit for a response. When the time reached 11:00 a.m., Britain and France formally declared war on Germany.</p>
<p>Hitler's power diplomacy has failed in this encirclement of Poland. What follows, of course, is war.</p>
<p>However, as we observe the situation before and after the opening of this European war, we clearly notice one of its characteristics, which is that neither side in the war, Britain and France on one side, and Germany on the other, has made a large-scale, final determination and preparation to completely eliminate the other's forces. Their war actions, strictly speaking, are still just engaging in armed diplomacy. In other words, in such a war, diplomatic contacts on both sides will never cease, and at every shift in the war situation, there is always a potential possibility of ending the war and reaching a compromise.</p>
<p>What is the most fundamental reason for this characteristic of the war? Undoubtedly, it is due to the huge presence of the socialist state, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That is why Mussolini did not participate in the war - this will be the most noteworthy role in the future situation in Europe. (September 3rd afternoon)</p>
<p>(4) Britain's "Preparation"</p>
<p>"Wooo...Wooo...!"..."Wooo...Wooo...!"...</p>
<p>So high-pitched, sharp, and trembling, the sirens announcing an air raid were sounding in the quiet London sky. Listening from my three-story apartment, it seemed as if this alarm system was spread all over the world. That pervasive, undulating, increasingly close and piercing, increasingly distant and faint, trembling sound seemed to fill all the space, extending to the distant, distant, and even more distant...that side of the horizon.</p>
<p>In this sound, you can immediately imagine, or rather, you seem to see, thousands and thousands of people being awakened from their beds at this moment.</p>
<p>Near my residence, there is a siren blaring loudly. In the sky above my residence, several huge balloons suddenly appeared - as if they had suddenly emerged from the ground. (Let me frankly admit; I had not noticed the slightest sign of this beforehand.)</p>
<p>Outside the window, there is a bottomless and boundless darkness. Thickly covering the light of the candle, I am writing this passage in the light of a large, tofu-sized area. But the stairs are ringing, ringing, ringing... - it sounds like someone is coming upstairs. ... (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e49">News from Suzhou and Wuxi: Fear of a Shortage of Auxiliary Currency; Fake Ministry of Finance Plans to Issue Fake Notes <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: In Suzhou, Wuxi, and surrounding counties, there has been a fear of a copper coin shortage for several months. Since June, copper coins have gradually decreased and disappeared completely, leading to a corresponding rise in prices. It is understood that the reasons for the copper coin shortage are nothing more than unscrupulous merchants hoarding and smuggling them for sale to the Japanese, seeking profit. After the copper coins disappeared, the only substitute was stamps, followed by many shops printing substitute notes. However, due to the ease of counterfeiting, up until now, apart from the substitute notes issued by a few larger businesses that are still in circulation, the only substitute for small change is still stamps. Recently, it has been heard that the puppet Ministry of Finance, due to the shortage of auxiliary currency and the disappearance of copper coins, has decided to issue fake copper notes, divided into denominations of one, five, fifteen, and thirty (cents). However, because there are fears of malpractices after these fake notes are issued, it has been provisionally decided as a transitional measure, and they must still be withdrawn. However, the circulation and exchange of these fake notes will be based on the puppet Hua Xing banknotes, with 400 fake copper notes exchanged for one yuan of puppet currency. However, the people still trust legal tender, and 300 fake copper notes can still be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender. The circulation of fake copper notes in each area is temporarily limited to 3,000, but the date of issue is not yet fixed, and the people in the occupied areas will have yet another type of chaotic currency product.</p>

<p>(Fangyan News) The Zhejiang Department of Education believes that broadcasting education is of utmost importance during this time of war. In addition to petitioning the Ministry of Education for funds to install dry cell DC generators, the department will also coordinate assistance measures to ensure that schools and libraries equipped with radios can listen regularly. Recently, Director Xu inspected various counties and saw that most of the radios installed in the county offices were damaged and left unused. He met with the personnel in charge of various counties to repair them and listen on time, so as to avoid long-term suspension of broadcast education. Recently, more than 10 radios have been sent to the department for repair.

<h3 id="e51">The Key Problems and Improvement Measures for Relief and Education of Refugee Children (Part Two) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Yonghe</p>
<p>(2) Escorting Personnel Receiving and Transporting Refugee Children: After obtaining transportation, escorting personnel become a major problem. Very few personnel can be dispatched to the vicinity of the war zone by various refugee relief organizations. If a large number of refugee children are transported at the same time, there are many refugee children but few escorting personnel, and it is felt that there is insufficient care. If they are transported in batches, the escorting personnel are insufficient. Escorting personnel must be shrewd and capable, kind and patient, and have the ability to manage children. It is truly rare to find someone who fully meets these conditions. However, there are often cases of people using the name of escorting refugee children to implement personal evacuation plans, carrying luggage, inviting relatives, and not taking responsibility for care along the way. There are also enthusiastic people who do their best to help refugee children and rescue them from danger. However, refugee children often suffer from illnesses or lack of nutrition as they flee, and they cannot withstand the journey. They fall ill on the way, and there are no doctors, nurses, or medicines, leading to deaths. Among the escorting personnel, doctors and nurses are sometimes added with simple medicines, but there cannot always be a complete organization. Refugee children come from various places and have not been trained. Naughty children often cause trouble. Escorting personnel often do not understand the psychology of children and cannot control them, or there is insufficient funding and difficulties in providing supplies. When the refugee children have been escorted to the rear orphanages or educational institutions and nurseries, the resettlement of the escorting personnel becomes a problem. In terms of sentiment and reason, escorting personnel should be given service opportunities after escorting the refugee children back. In terms of the administrative situation of each institution, these temporarily added teachers and staff have various difficulties in terms of economy, personnel, management, and allocation. In addition, lists of refugee children and all transfer procedures are often not clearly handed over due to urgency, which can also cause many disputes.</p>
<p>(3) Temporary Shelters: Wartime refugee children cannot be transported to the rear immediately, so temporary shelters are often established in the rear close to the war zone. In temporary shelters, education is less important, but the difficulty of providing care is extremely serious. For example, in a shelter for 500 children, batches of children are sent from the front lines. People are busy with the medical treatment of sick children, washing clothes, and arranging teams. When they are sent to the rear, people are in a hurry to contact transportation and dispatch escorting personnel. Sometimes the number of children coming exceeds the number of children being sent out. Food, bedding, and all daily necessities are insufficient. Children who come like a flowing stream have not undergone strict training and are even more difficult to manage. Or because the houses are scattered in several places, administration becomes more lax. The director often has the difficulty of being stretched thin. In addition, in the event of enemy bombing, even if there are air-raid shelters nearby, it is extremely difficult and stressful for teachers and staff to lead a large number of untrained children to take cover.

<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Double Tenth Festival charity football match organized by the Hong Kong English Relief China Branch, Chinese League vs. Western League, was held at the Hong Kong Football Club in Happy Valley this afternoon.

The Hong Kong student athletes defeated the Kowloon student athletes with a score of 2 to 1. After the student team match, the Chinese League vs. Western League match followed. Xu Jingcheng of the Chinese League misremembered the start time and arrived too late. Eight minutes later, the new force Yang Zixiang arrived and finally gathered enough people. Liao Yachen and Nuofu of the Western League did not play, and goalkeeper Ji Chen did not come either. The new general Dou Like from Miduxin was temporarily used to guard the goal. For the first 33 minutes after the contact, there were no records. Then Yang Shuiyi of the Chinese League scored a wonderful shot and took the lead with a score of 1 to 0 in the first half.

<h3 id="e63">Finance: Foreign Exchange Bulls Close Positions in Droves; British Gold Once Reached 5 Pence; US Dollar Seen at 8.75 Yuan; Sassoon Covered Shorts, and the Market Rebounded Slightly; Trade Surplus is One Reason for Looser Conditions <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC official exchange rate announcement showed that the British exchange rate increased by 1.25, reaching 4 shillings and 25 pence, and the US dollar rose by 4.375, to 7.125 yuan. The rest also showed a consistent increase. The informal market conditions for British and US exchanges continued the looser trend of the previous day. This newspaper predicted last weekend that the British gold exchange rate would break the 5-shilling mark and the US dollar would break the 8-yuan mark, which has already been seen in the facts of the previous days. However, at present, the 5-shilling line for British gold and the 8.5-yuan line for the US dollar seem to be temporarily hovering. As for the reasons for the looser exchange market, it is said that the most important reasons are that a certain party that used to manipulate the market has abandoned its old tricks and shifted to searching for local goods in the mainland for export. And the recent surge in overseas silk prices has led to huge exports of cocoons and silk from this port, and other goods have also changed from imports to exports. Therefore, exporters have to release funds every day, and Hong Kong banks are competing to sell foreign exchange and purchase Shanghai yarn and other goods, and the chips are becoming more and more crowded. And the absorption capacity of banks is ultimately limited, and the HSBC, which is enough to influence the market, is not as strong as before, so a situation of extreme supply and demand has formed. In today's trading process, it was hard as soon as it opened. HSBC had a slight absorption capacity at that time. Later, all speculators in Shanghai, such as yarn and flower gangs and securities gangs, all came to sell, and at the same time, HSBC had no intention to buy, which led to the loosest US dollar price of 8.75 yuan and the British gold price breaking the 5-shilling mark, creating a new recent high price of 5 shillings and 25 pence. However, not long after, foreign firms and Chinese businessmen absorbed some, and the market then rebounded to 5 shillings and 0625 pence and 8.5 yuan. Extending to the noon closing, British gold rose again to 5 shillings and 125 pence, and the US dollar also loosened again to 8.625 yuan. In the afternoon, the market suddenly turned tight, the profit absorption became stronger, and the Western businessman Sassoon fiercely covered shorts (it is said that the number reached more than 100,000 pounds), and at the same time, the Hong Kong banks suddenly had the intention to buy, and it fell all the way to 4 shillings and 9375 pence for British gold and 8.1875 yuan for the US dollar. However, by the evening closing, the situation had stabilized. The closing price of British gold was 4 shillings and 96875 pence, which was still 09375 pence harder than the previous day, and the US dollar was 8.3125 yuan, which was also 125 looser than the previous day. In terms of futures trading, there were also those who did it, but the prices had been slightly squeezed together, and the potential was no different from the spot market. The whole day's trading was still strong.</p>
<p>HSBC Official Exchange Rate Announcement Shows Consistent Increase</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London Bank Rate was nearly 25 points longer than the long-term rate, the New York silver price was 375 points higher, the London gold price was stable, the exchange rates for British to US and British to French were both flat, the exchange rate to Shanghai rose by 375 points, the exchange rate to US rose by 375 points, the exchange rate to Shanghai rose by 4 cents, and the exchange rate to French rose by 25 points. The Central Bank's official exchange rates for each exchange remained the same as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 90625 pence for British gold and 8.21875 yuan for the US dollar, which were 03125 pence looser for both British and US exchanges than the previous closing. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams and speculators first came to sell, but at that time, HSBC still had a small amount of absorption capacity, so the looser trend was still slow. It is estimated that HSBC absorbed Hong Kong telegrams and speculator spot British gold at 4 shillings and 9375 pence, and a certain bank also purchased Chinese merchant spot US dollars at 8.8125 yuan. The HSBC official exchange rate announcement showed an increase of 25 points for British exchange and an increase of 4.375 points for the US dollar, and the silver balance tax announcement remained unchanged. After that, speculators such as yarn and flower gangs and securities gangs came to close positions one after another, and Hong Kong telegrams and Tianjin gangs also had strong selling pressure. In addition, HSBC stopped absorbing, and other foreign firms were basically inactive, so it was extremely loose, and the market was chaotic, and the price unexpectedly increased to 5 shillings and 25 pence and 8.75 yuan. Until around 11 o'clock, the Western merchant Sassoon and a certain US bank suddenly took the opportunity to absorb, and at the same time, other foreign firms also had a slight absorption capacity, and it was heard that foreign firms and Chinese merchants also made settlements from it, so the situation rebounded slightly, once returning to 5 shillings and 0625 pence and 8.5 yuan. After 11:30, the absorption trend subsided again, and the potential trend became looser again, closing at 5 shillings and 125 pence for British gold and 8.625 yuan for the US dollar, which was 21875 pence looser for British and 40625 yuan harder for the US exchange rate than the morning opening.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Banks Also Closed Positions Slightly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>There was a certain rumor in the afternoon market, but the impact on the market was that the Western merchant Sassoon came to absorb again, and the profit absorption of British banks suddenly became stronger. In addition, it was heard that Hong Kong banks stopped selling and slightly absorbed, so the trend turned around. It is estimated that Sassoon and the profitable absorbed foreign firm spot British gold at 5 shillings and 0625 pence and 4 shillings and 96875 pence, and spot US dollars at 8.5 yuan and 3125 yuan. After entering, the tightest British gold was once called over 4 shillings and 9375 pence, and the US dollar was also called over 8.1875 yuan. However, the result was the late closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 96875 pence for British gold and 8.3125 yuan for the US dollar, which were the same as the spot prices this month. The November prices were 4 shillings and 921875 pence for British gold and 8.21875 yuan for the US dollar, which were 09375 pence looser for the British and 125 yuan harder for the US exchange rate than the previous day's spot prices. The November British exchange rate was 109375 pence longer and the US exchange rate was 15625 points cheaper.</p>

The spot Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 4 yuan, to 298 yuan. At 10:35, the spot Shanghai exchange rate continued to drop by 9 yuan, to 289 yuan.

<h3 id="e64">Instability Fuels Gold Market Plunge and Rebound: Fluctuations of 200 Yuan in a Day, Dropping to a Low of 3,600 Yuan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "烚赤" (speculative gold) market was volatile. Although the overall decline throughout the day was less than 100 yuan, the turbulence was expanding, with sudden ups and downs mainly due to market instability. The price fell to a low of 3,600 yuan due to a sudden tightening of foreign exchange rates. However, the closing price rebounded to 3,765 yuan. The day's trading started lower, opening at 3,805 yuan, down 45 yuan from the previous day. The market was initially calm, but then a significant easing of foreign exchange rates caused British gold to break through the five-penny barrier, leading to frantic selling. The downward trend was difficult to control, reaching a low of 3,600 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate slightly recovered, and securities firms and money changers entered the market to buy, pushing the price up to 3,760 yuan. However, few remained enthusiastic, and the price fell sharply to 3,660 yuan by the noon close. The afternoon session opened at 3,640 yuan, and the market seemed stable, but then the exchange rate rebounded sharply, gradually pushing the price up to 3,792 yuan. It was reported that Hong Kong firms seized the opportunity to trade, and securities firms bought back a significant amount due to excessive selling the previous day. Ultimately, the market closed at 3,765 yuan, a further drop of 85 yuan from the previous day, marking the sixth consecutive day of decline, with a total decrease of 259 yuan. Trading was brisk throughout the day, reaching several thousand taels. Jewelry gold initially fell and then rebounded, ultimately settling at a decrease of ten yuan. Gold at the customs remained stable.</p>
<p>烚赤 (Speculative Gold) Down 85 Yuan</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened weak and listless. Some, hearing of a strengthening of foreign exchange rates, sold at lower prices, with the opening down 45 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to securities firms at a price of 3,805 yuan. Subsequently, the market stabilized briefly, hovering around the 3,800 yuan mark. Around 9:35 AM, news of a significant easing of foreign exchange rates triggered widespread selling, with securities firms, Yuhao and money changers all rushing to sell. The market became chaotic, and the price plummeted by 155 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,650 yuan. Afterwards, another securities firm bought at a low price, pulling it up by 30 yuan. Securities firms bought 50 taels at a price of 3,680 yuan. At that time, a certain money changer aggressively sold around 300 taels, pushing the price down by another 25 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to securities firms at a price of 3,655 yuan. Then, a certain money changer suddenly profited and re-entered the market, along with retail investors following suit, quickly pushing the market back above the 3,700 yuan mark. Money changers bought 30 taels at a price of 3,720 yuan. At 10:40 AM, news of an expanding easing of the foreign exchange market triggered another wave of selling, with jewelry firms, securities firms, and money changers rushing to sell, causing another sharp drop of 120 yuan. Money changers sold a total of 40 taels to other money changers and securities firms at a price of 3,600 yuan. After 11:00 AM, news of a tightening of foreign exchange rates spurred buying, with securities firms and money changers stopping sales and aggressively buying. At the same time, it was reported that Hong Kong firms were also buying, quickly driving the price up by 160 yuan. Securities firms bought 30 taels at a price of 3,760 yuan. Approaching noon, foreign exchange rates suddenly eased again, causing another wave of selling, with jewelry firms and money changers competing to sell, pushing the price down by 100 yuan. Money changers traded 30 taels among themselves, with the closing price for the noon session at 3,660 yuan. The afternoon session opened weak, down another 20 yuan, with securities firms selling 10 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,640 yuan. Subsequently, news of a tightening of foreign exchange rates triggered buying by money changers, immediately pushing the price up by 90 yuan. Money changers bought 30 taels from jewelry firms at a price of 3,730 yuan. At that time, another money changer and gold shop sold, briefly pushing the price back down to 3,715 yuan. Finally, due to further softening of the foreign exchange market and the buying of securities firms and a certain money changer, the price was pushed up again by 30 yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from gold shops at a price of 3,745 yuan. Later, due to a certain money changer selling again, the price retreated by 20 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,725 yuan. At that time, securities firms continued to buy, and it was reported that Hong Kong firms were active again.

<p>In the over-the-counter securities market yesterday, various bonds continued to advance. The bullish sentiment seemed determined to see the Category C bonds reach 50 yuan, causing panic among short sellers, to reap the benefits. The market trended upwards throughout the morning and afternoon. At the same time, those covering short positions were also very active. The sharp drop in gold prices provided significant support to the bulls. Category E bonds were not far from 50 yuan, but suddenly fell by more than half a yuan after the close. The reasons given for the initial rise were a misunderstanding that someone had been sent to Shanghai to negotiate peace, and then rumors that someone would take office. In reality, after rising for many days, a slight pullback was to be expected. Yesterday, the market opened at a high price in the morning, and the bulls weakened slightly in the middle of the day, but then rebounded again as short sellers covered their positions. Dafeng and Tongkang were bought heavily, while Yongkang and Lianhe were sold heavily. The trend was firm. In the afternoon, those pushing up prices were numerous, and Tiansheng sold off a bit. Number 11 was also selling, pushing the price up by another two or three dimes, resulting in a further increase of eight or nine dimes. The news was unfavorable after the close, and the price fell sharply by more than half a yuan. Foreign exchange rates tightened again, and gold rebounded by one or two hundred yuan. The situation was complicated and difficult to understand. The future of the bond market is full of changes. Total trading volume for the day was estimated at around 1.2 million yuan. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 20 shares of China National Goods Company were traded at a price of 22.5 yuan, and 100 shares of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory stock were traded at a price of 74 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association stated that due to the volatile foreign exchange market and unstable fluctuations, the stock market also fluctuated greatly yesterday. The selling side was active when the market opened in the morning, and prices were weak. However, the decline was halted after the exchange rate tightened, and the market returned to normal stability.</p>
<p>There were no changes in London's Chinese bond and Far East British stock market prices.</p>
<p>London, 23rd: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks were generally stable, with no changes in prices.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Yarn and Cotton: Hoarders Rush to Liquidate, Yarn Market Declines Sharply, Double Horse and Earth Each Drop by More Than 30 Yuan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to fall sharply, like a river flowing downhill. The market sentiment is very weak because hoarders with weak capital are seeing the forward premiums on both Shilling and American yarn increasing, and the gold price is falling, causing instability in hoarding psychology, and they are rushing to liquidate. At the same time, actual transactions are sluggish, and scalpers take advantage of the situation to push prices up and down, often disrupting the market. As for certain parties in the past who contacted a major factory to promote Double Horse yarn, they have recently abandoned their efforts, causing the decline to be even more severe. However, the profit margin has become slim as the price is now close to the factory's cost.</p>
<p>When the yarn market opened this morning, many brokers gathered, but most were just talking. There was a lot of chaotic shouting to sell. The opening price fell by 30 yuan, with spot Double Horse yarn at 625 yuan, and then 3 yuan less. However, there was little demand for warehouse receipts. Subsequently, as the demand from customers remained weak, and the foreign exchange rate eased, market sentiment weakened further, and many sought to liquidate. The price fell by another 15 yuan, with the lowest price for Double Horse yarn at 610 yuan. As the market was about to close, the continuous sharp decline triggered scalper activity, who bought a few bales, suddenly pushing the price up by more than ten yuan. The final closing price was 622 yuan. According to statistics, 1,860 bales were traded in the first half of the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 32 yuan, Tiannv yarn fell by 19 yuan, and Double Earth yarn fell by 35 yuan. Today, 15 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 290 bales were shipped to Tianjin. The amount bought by each group is listed as follows: 1,530 bales by fellow traders, 255 bales by Hong Kong firms, 75 bales to inland areas, totaling 1,860 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Tonghua (Cotton) Falls Another 7 Yuan, Only One Transaction <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The cotton trade has completely ground to a halt, mainly because the foreign exchange rate is easing, and the gold price has fallen sharply, making the calculated price of foreign cotton cheaper. Factories are facing this harsh environment, coupled with the sluggishness of the yarn market, making them more constrained. The cotton market is in dire straits. The basis is different. Tongzhou cotton fell sharply by 7 yuan, with 200 bales bought from fellow traders at a price of 128 yuan, paid in cash and delivered from the warehouse. The total of Tongzhou cotton arriving at the dock was 1,757 bales. The current cotton sales are listed below.</p>
<p>According to another report, the foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been sluggish recently due to the easing of the foreign exchange rate and the sharp fall in yarn prices. Compared to the recent high prices, cotton yarn has fallen by as much as 230 to 240 yuan per bale. Shanghai has a large inventory of cotton yarn. According to various observations, prices are expected to continue to decline. The raw cotton trade has been severely affected by the cotton yarn market. Factories and fellow traders have stopped buying due to the low price of cotton, fearing further appreciation of the exchange rate, so the market is very quiet.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially quiet but then firmed up. The telegram from Bombay was positive, and the market became even firmer. Trading among fellow traders was good, and the textile industry's purchase of raw cotton was still enthusiastic, so recent prices have been firm. However, forward American cotton fell by three to five points due to selling by speculators, Egyptian cotton fell by more than ten points, and Liverpool fell by three points.</p>

<p>The rice market has been hovering around the same level in recent weeks. After the price of various types of rice rose again in the previous dynasty, the market opened yesterday with continued firmness due to various sources, including shipments of No. 5 rice down the river and over 3,000 bales of "baozi" rice by rail. The local rice shops took action, and merchants started to raise prices, creating a tighter situation. However, the appetite of the rice shops was not strong, and the momentum quickly weakened, and the market gradually became more stable and then declined. Therefore, the result was an initial tightening followed by weakening, remaining relatively stable overall, with no significant gains or losses in the closing prices. The opening prices for common Xichang large market new粳 rice was 31 yuan or 30 yuan and 5 jiao, average quality 28 or 29 yuan, broken 粳 average quality 30 yuan or so, substandard quality 27 yuan. Special rice was scarce and without market. Su Tongkun Chang new 粳 high quality 30 yuan, average quality 28 or 29 yuan, broken 粳 transactions rare, opening at only 26 or 27 yuan. Qingjiao Kiln variety 31 yuan and a half, wild rice 31 yuan and a half, Fengjia Baige special 29 yuan and a half, average 29 yuan, 28 yuan and a half, Songjiang substandard Baige 27 yuan, thin and broken original package 26 yuan and a half, 26 yuan, retail 25 yuan, Nangang white rice 30 yuan, early broken 26 yuan, special Yangjian 24 yuan, substandard to 21 yuan, special Lujian 24 yuan and a half, substandard to 22 yuan and a half, Jiangbei Jian 19 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, Nanjing No. 1 Jian 20 yuan 3 fen, No. 2 19 yuan 8 jiao, No. 3 19 yuan and a half, Wuhu special Jian 20 yuan 2 fen, substandard to 19 yuan, Chen Bianyuan has become less popular recently, with extremely weak sales and a lack of high-quality rice in the market, presenting a flat and weak market, opening at 30 yuan, 29 yuan for average quality, and new Baiyuan is wider in distribution, and is seemingly firm, so it still opens at 26 or 27 yuan. Total transaction volume for the city was over 7,000 bales.</p>
<p>The opening buying interest of Ke Xian (Rice) was very strong yesterday morning, but after the Japanese merchants had been selling off for days, they suddenly stopped. The local merchants unanimously raised prices, with prices increasing by 2, 3, or 4 jiao. The market traders took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the Japanese merchants may continue to sell, so the market quickly turned weak, and prices decreased again by 2 or 3 jiao. In the afternoon, trading was balanced, and the market lacked change.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Flour Sales Active <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Spot flour trading continued to be active yesterday, due to continuous purchases from merchants. In addition to merchants from Beiyang adding more to their inventories, there was also demand from Nanyang, Hong Kong, and Xiamen. The circulating inventory in the market has long been depleted, and wheat prices have been rising continuously, making factories firmer in their selling intentions. In addition to supplying the local market at the original price of 7 yuan 3 jiao, the price for merchant orders was 7 yuan 4 jiao, and the price for re-warehoused goods had to be increased by a few fen to a jiao. It was reported that transactions of one or two thousand bags each were made with Tianjin, Tanggu, Hong Kong, and Xiamen, making the market quite firm. It was found that 1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Municipal Council Strives to Maintain Rights and Interests, Seeks to Resolve Disputes in West Shanghai, Fessenden Has Already Met With the Puppet Mayor, Situation in West Shanghai Eases Yesterday <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>According to diplomatic sources, the Municipal Council requested "friendly mediation" from the Japanese consul regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries. They simply wanted the Japanese side to remain a third party, mediating and not continuing to support the puppet regime's actions, which would lead to an escalation of the situation. At the same time, they were prepared to make some concessions and request the convocation of a meeting of the Diplomatic Body for discussion in order to obtain a solution. However, the Japanese side ignored this and refused to submit it to the Diplomatic Body for discussion, so the meeting originally scheduled for the 19th could not be held. Therefore, some believe that this action by the Japanese side was not prudent. The Japanese side's refusal to discuss "legal issues" was generally considered to be expected. When the Mayor of Shanghai, Yu Hongjun, negotiated this issue with Fessenden, the Japanese side strongly opposed the handover of the roads beyond the boundaries to the Chinese government. Now they insist on transferring the jurisdiction of the roads beyond the boundaries to the puppet "municipal government," which is inconsistent with their previous position. However, both the Diplomatic Body and the Municipal Council are dealing with this issue with a calm attitude, and there is no immediate threat of a breakdown. The development situation yesterday is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Situation in the Concessions Must Not Be Changed <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>In the past ten days, disputes over road construction beyond the boundaries in western Shanghai have occurred repeatedly. The attacks on the police by the puppet police and "self-defense corps" have placed the status of the concessions in a serious situation. All sectors, both Chinese and foreign, are paying close attention. Yesterday, an official from a certain country stated that after the successive attacks on detectives on the 20th and 22nd, the Municipal Council, in addition to negotiating with the puppet "municipal government," also reported the entire incident to the Diplomatic Body for handling. The consuls of various countries in Shanghai will convene a meeting around the end of this month to discuss countermeasures and seek possible solutions. However, for the time being, they are unwilling to express any opinion on this case. The US government has repeatedly stated that the situation in the Shanghai concessions must not be changed, and British personnel have repeatedly expressed their determination to protect the rights and interests of the concessions. The authorities of both countries are now cooperating to deal with the situation. The current state of the concessions should not change. As for the rumors that the US troops stationed in Shanghai may be stationed in the area west of Shanghai after the above two incidents, it is said that if US troops are stationed west of Shanghai, it would be a matter of adjusting the defense zone. However, the incident west of Shanghai should not be related to the adjustment of the defense zone. The rumor that US troops would take over the defense west of Shanghai is not yet credible, as the meeting to adjust the defense zone has not made any progress.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Both Parties Held Formal Talks the Night Before Last <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Da Zhong News Agency reporter learned from diplomatic circles last night about the meeting between the chairman of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, and the puppet "Mayor, Chuan Xiao'an, on the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries on the evening of the 23rd. In addition to Fessenden and Chuan Xiao'an, those present that evening included the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and head of the Shanghai Diplomatic Body, Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, and Japanese Consul General Yoshiaki Miura. Therefore, the talks that night had a mediating meaning. It is said that the meeting went well, with few disputes and more suggestions. All parties advocated accelerating the end of the dispute. With the advice and support of the Italian and Japanese consuls, it was decided that the Municipal Council and the puppet "municipal government" should reopen direct negotiations. At the meeting, Chuan Xiao'an also stated that the puppet "municipal government" originally planned to collect vehicle fees on roads beyond the boundaries starting from November 1, but now intends to postpone the implementation. Yesterday, the Italian Consul General also stated to the outside world: (1) The general situation of the road issue beyond the boundaries will not further deteriorate. (2) There is no definite date for the Consular Corps to hold a meeting for discussion. (3) According to the current situation, the United States will not take action on the Shanghai concession issue.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation Recorded in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" stated that the chairman of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, formally began negotiations with the puppet mayor, Fu Xiaoan, last night (the 23rd) with the aim of resolving the issue of roads outside the boundaries and breaking the stalemate that had lasted for six months. The predictions made by the English "Da Mei Evening News" on Saturday and Sunday have been fulfilled. The talks lasted several hours last night, and both sides expressed "considerable satisfaction". Details of the meeting could not be disclosed today, but it was learned from reliable sources that both Fessenden and Chuan put forward several suggestions. Both parties have announced their desire to properly manage the roads outside the boundaries, and the implementation of law and order should be maintained to ensure the safety of traffic and residents' lives in the area. Therefore, most people feel that the two parties should hold discussions on a large scale in order to clarify the various incidents of this dispute. The suggestions made by both sides should be given great understanding so that the problem can be finally resolved. This morning, reliable sources claimed that Fessenden and Chuan's meeting brought the problem closest to a resolution, as the entire problem requires direct negotiation between the two parties.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Sent Letter to Police Commissioner Bowen</p>
<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" reported that on Sunday morning, a Chinese police officer was shot dead near the Wujiaochang in Bailinan Road, causing a fierce fight between the public concession police and the "self-defense corps". After one member was killed and seven or eight people were injured, Japanese Consul General Miura sent a letter to Police Commissioner Bowen. Today (the 24th), it was learned that the letter was not in the form of a protest, but contained suggestions that the police department could not accept. Police Commissioner Bowen has replied to the letter.</p>
<p>The Situation Eased Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the conflict between the Municipal Council police and the "self-defense corps" occurred in Caojiadu Wujiaochang in western Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd, the concession authorities have implemented special alerts for several days in order to maintain local security. Starting yesterday, the number of armored vehicles stationed there has been reduced from three to two. The number of detectives and puppet police has also been greatly reduced. The curfew has been lifted in the evening. However, the police station still sent a large number of police officers, divided into two red police cars and two No. 3 and No. 5 armored gun vehicles, to patrol Yuyuan Road, Yidingpan Road, Jishifei Road, Bailinan Road, and Kangnuot Road all day long. At the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road, in addition to building a large sand castle at the northeast corner, the British defense forces also built a small sand castle at the southeast corner (beside the gate of No. 993 Yuyuan Road) on the afternoon before yesterday, making the defense stronger.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Fuel the Flames</p>
<p>"Dalu News" stated that yesterday (the 21st), the Japanese newspaper in this port carried a report stating that "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan believed that the public concession police's shooting with Chinese people in No. 1081 Jishifeier Road on Sunday morning was an invasion of the jurisdiction of the "Special Municipal Government". Therefore, on Sunday night, it was decided to lodge a strong protest with the Municipal Council. The protest will point out that the police department did not notify the "Special Municipal Government" in advance before taking action on houses outside the jurisdiction of the police department.</p>
<p>As a result, two Chinese people died and three were injured. According to the Japanese "Dalu News Daily", the Japanese Military Police Department will also negotiate with the Municipal Council. At the same time, the Italian authorities stationed in Shanghai issued a statement to the Allied Press, stating that they believe that the Italian Marines had joined the police department in shooting at the people in the house on Jishifeier Road. Check</p>
<p>The Message About Italian Soldiers Shooting</p>
<p>A certain English newspaper and the French "Morning Post" reported that the Italian authorities issued a statement saying that Italian troops arrived at the scene after the Japanese troops and "municipal government" police and assisted in restoring order as usual without using weapons. In addition, the "Zi Lin Daily" reported that regarding Chuan Xiaoan and the Japanese Military Police Department's "protest" to the Municipal Council, the Director General of the Municipal Council, Philippe, replied to questions before dusk yesterday that he had not received such documents.</p>
<p>Gun Bullet Experts Examine Bullet Casings</p>
<p>Shanghai "Times" reported that gun bullet experts at the public concession police department worked hard on Sunday and yesterday (the 23rd) to classify the bullet casings found at the shooting site on Jishifeier Road on Sunday morning. The authorities hope to be able to find out whether there is a connection between the attack on the Chinese and Indian police on Yuyuan Road on Friday night and the shooting on Sunday morning by using this method. All the standing bureaus have expressed great concern about the issue of roads outside the boundaries. It was confirmed yesterday that the Consular Corps has taken over the handling of the issue of roads outside the boundaries. The secretary of the Consular Corps stated yesterday that although the Consular Corps has not taken definite action, it has formally taken over the handling of the issue of roads outside the boundaries.</p>

<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" stated that regarding the requirement for all vehicles traveling on roads outside the boundaries to have a "Special Municipal Government" license, Chuan Xiaoan has agreed to postpone the implementation until January 1 of next year due to the subtle and unstable current situation in the area outside the boundary and after receiving a formal request. The "Special Municipal Government" had originally decided that all vehicles must have a new license starting from November 1. However, due to the recent tense developments in the area outside the boundary and the Consular Corps' letter to Chuan Xiaoan requesting a continued postponement, Chuan reconsidered the matter and postponed the implementation.</p>

It is understood that the total number of ships of the shipping company has reached fifty-nine, totaling 152,095 tons. However, the Japanese side still believes that this number of ships is insufficient to meet the needs of various routes. Recently, new ships are being added, including twelve ships already decided: Myoko, Zuiho, Kōtai, Ningbo, Uraga, Kōkoku, Kōryū, Kōun, Kōshō, Kōhei, etc., with a total carrying capacity of 44,144 tons.</p>

<p>The Soybean and Rice Merchants' Association held its 56th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the third session at the Association's premises on Edward Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Those present were Xing Zhigang, Zhu Zixiang, Cai Yukun, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Xiangsheng, Fu Qiangeng, She Bingwen, Chen Ziyi, Jiang Hongbin, Zhou Zizhen, Yang Heqing, etc. Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department also attended. Xing Zhigang was elected as the chairman. The resolution regarding how to handle the brokerage fees repeatedly requested by brokers was passed as follows: "It has been found that the customer rice in the Yangtze River area has always been unloaded in its original packaging without withholding brokerage fees. The broker's request is not allowed. However, in this extraordinary period, the lives of brokers are indeed difficult. Based on the repeated requests and the mediation of Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, it is allowed that the seller and the buyer each contribute half a cent per shih to provide relief. Once the situation is calm, this measure will be cancelled and not be used as an example."</p>
<p>Mediation Committee</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the seven rice industry groups each sending a mediation committee member, the mediation committee members of each group have now been appointed.

<p>Interception of Rice Boats</p>
<p>In addition, rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai from the riverside used to dock between the Jiangxi Road Bridge and the Henan Road Bridge. It is now known that they have all been intercepted by the Japanese and landed at the pier between the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Waibaidu Bridge. The Japanese's intention in doing so is to facilitate taxation.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Rice Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market received more than two thousand more packages of goods than before, but prices still rose by half a yuan or three jiao. The reason is that a small number of rice grains transported to Shanghai in the inner harbor were detained. However, the lowest price of Jiangbei indica rice is still nineteen yuan five jiao.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Color Printing Industry Association believes that the printing prices stipulated in the industry regulations set in December of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) are not practical and have long been a dead letter. Therefore, it convened a temporary member representative congress on July 30 of this year to revise the cost prices for the emergency period and believed that all industries in the city must have the same feeling in this difficult time. Therefore, on August 15, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that exceptions be made to avoid hindering business. It is now known that the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that convening a temporary member congress by various industry associations during this period is not in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Organizations During Emergency Times," and thus the request is not approved. If there is a need to revise methods in terms of business, members' opinions can be sought through discussion meetings. Furthermore, it is inappropriate to make exceptions.</p>

<h3 id="e85">America Should Value Shanghai Trade <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— By Baemin</p>
<p>Translated from Millard's Review</p>
<p>American trade and shipping across the Pacific, because of the continuous war within China and the outbreak of the European War, now encounter many new difficulties, and perhaps there will be more in the future. American commerce and shipping from Singapore in the south to Kamchatka in the north have recently been or will soon be subject to various new reductions, restrictions, and controls. The extent to which American commerce cannot freely enter and exit the Far East is unprecedented in recent decades.</p>
<p>The serious economic crisis that Japan is shaking is clearly not causing the Japanese warlords to repent. Not only are the Japanese warlords not ending their adventures in China that have caused this crisis, but they are also making new efforts to concentrate the remaining economic strength of their country to continue the war against China. Japan's buying and selling power at home and abroad is constantly declining, while Japan's military rulers continue to cut off Japan's foreign trade to meet their own urgent needs. Japan's imports from the United States are currently limited to direct or indirect military supplies.</p>
<p>On July 16 of this year, the U.S. State Department abolished the 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which will expire in just three months after October 26. There is now little hope of extending the period, or perhaps none at all, and the hope of Tokyo and Washington concluding a new treaty is even weaker. This week, the Allied News Agency reported that Japanese Prime Minister Abe declared on October 16 that he thought the U.S. and Japan might conclude a temporary treaty, but it has not yet begun or prepared for negotiations. As it appears, Japan is unwilling to change its discriminatory policy of excluding American merchants in its occupied areas in China. However, this change seems to be a necessary condition for any new commercial treaty between the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>As it appears, on the contrary, Japan will continue to make strong efforts to close the open door in China. For several weeks, the Japanese and their puppet regime have been consulting and preparing a uniform system to exclude Western systems, which means engaging in monopolistic trade and foreign exchange control in various occupied areas. The economic blockade of Tianjin has been strengthened again since the recent retreat of the North China floods. The Japanese are also currently economically blockading the Western commercial interests of Shanghai. Many raw materials and food that continued to be transported from the interior of Central China to the Shanghai concessions during the first two years of the Sino-Japanese War have been blocked by the Japanese in recent weeks for their own interests. The goods that have been blocked now include not only silk cocoons, raw cotton, and tung oil, but even rice, eggs, and bristles. Shanghai's export industry, in which the United States has invested significant capital and is the most important customer for these exports, is now being deliberately driven to a dead end by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese naval blockade of the Chinese coast is constantly expanding. Zhan'aotou Port near the Zhejiang-Fujian border has recently been blockaded. The Japanese have ordered foreign shipping to leave the port and go further south. The Japanese are intensifying the horror of bombing small ports still in Chinese hands, further isolating Hong Kong from economic exchanges with other ports. Most of the remaining trade between Hong Kong and South China is now concentrated in Portuguese Macau and French Guangzhou Bay. The Japanese army's recent occupation of Shiqi in the Pearl River Delta region has cut off Macau and the adjacent Chinese port of Lapba (transliteration) from contact with the interior, leaving Hong Kong only one route through Guangzhou Bay to enter Free China. The Japanese army is now also preparing to land in the suburbs near the French concession.</p>
<p>American commerce in the British and French colonies on the South China coast has encountered new trade and foreign exchange controls as a result of the outbreak of the European War. Americans are no longer able to freely remit funds in and out of these colonies, nor are they able to freely obtain raw materials there, but the supply of raw materials for American industries is largely dependent on these colonies, especially rubber and tin. As far as American merchants are concerned, the two major ports of Singapore and Hong Kong have lost the true nature of free ports, just as Dalian lost that nature more than two years ago.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, apart from China, the most important trading partner is the United States, and the United States occupies an absolute controlling position in Singapore's commerce. Singapore's raw material market, like other parts of the British Empire, has been subject to strict price controls since the outbreak of the European War. The prices of rubber, tin, and other goods in Singapore are now being artificially prevented from exceeding the level deemed appropriate by London's economic warfare policy. The prices of these same goods in the United States have risen sharply in recent weeks. The question to be answered later is whether the United States will allow purchases in Singapore at lower controlled prices, or whether the United States will have to purchase at higher prices set according to American price levels.</p>
<p>On the entire Pacific coast of the Far Eastern continent, only one major port remains where foreign goods can be freely imported, exports can be freely shipped out, transit trade can be freely conducted, and at the same time there is a free exchange market that is not subject to any foreign exchange controls. This port is Shanghai. Huge American interests are already in danger in this port, and this port will be of even greater importance to American Far Eastern trade and other commerce. Therefore, it is extremely clear that it is in America's own interests to help maintain at least the openness of this port. Most of America's trade with China is concentrated in Shanghai. Similarly, Shanghai is the center of American commercial investment in China. Americans occupy a share in the administrative organs of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Public Works Department of the International Settlement is chaired by an American citizen.</p>
<p>The Japanese in Japan, the British and French in their colonies, of course have the right to adopt whatever economic plans they choose. The only way left for American commercial interests to seek redress when they are hit by such plans is through negotiation. But the Japanese certainly have no right to do whatever they want in Shanghai, to start an economic blockade, to cut off the connection between the Shanghai market and the interior, and to infringe upon Western interests that are firmly established and whose free activities are guaranteed by international treaties. No country has the right to close the open door in Shanghai. Any country that attempts to do so will not only severely damage American economic interests in the Far East, but will certainly infringe upon American rights and privileges. With the European War now underway, Shanghai remains the most free port in the Far East, greatly increasing its importance. Since the ports of the British and French colonies are already under wartime economic control, then every action Japan takes against Shanghai today is more damaging to American interests. Therefore, American interests in Shanghai must be maintained.</p>
<p>In view of the special importance of Shanghai to American interests, it is entirely proper that the American shipping industry in this city has raised questions with Washington about the current amendments to American neutrality laws. It is now necessary to be very careful to prevent the application of the future characteristics of the new American neutrality laws from being unfavorable to American commercial interests in Shanghai and indirectly beneficial to the Japanese. If the United States completely applies the neutrality laws to the entire British and French territories, and American shipping to Hong Kong and Singapore is reduced or stopped, then only Shanghai will remain as the only important port on the Far Eastern continent to support American Eastern shipping. If the Japanese are taught a lesson in Shanghai and do not interfere with the parts of the Shanghai market that are still managed by the Western countries, then American shipping will enjoy special navigational convenience under American law because of extraterritoriality.</p>
<p>In recent months, American trans-Pacific shipping has been strongly recovering and flourishing. The reorganization of the Dollar Steamship Company into the American President Lines, the recent establishment of the Puget Sound Oriental Steamship Company, and the large-scale shipbuilding advocated by the U.S. Maritime Commission are all important factors in this recovery and prosperity. The U.S. Maritime Commission is now building new-style cargo ships at a rate of fifty-two ships per year or one ship per week. The first new cargo ship was launched a few months ago and is currently being completed. In a very short time, these cargo ships will first appear at sea. Its important trend is to increase American shipping on the Pacific Ocean, and this is not a secret event. In addition, the invocation of the amended neutrality laws, especially the "cash and carry" principle, by the European belligerents will leave a large number of American ships idle, and they will sail into the Pacific to seek alternative commerce.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, from the perspective of American shipping, it seems that the United States cannot afford to lose its free access to its foothold in Shanghai. However, if the Japanese are allowed to completely suppress the Shanghai market, the result will be the loss of this free access.</p>

According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this port, Hull did issue this statement, but he said that the opinion that the United States is prepared to intervene in the Shanghai situation is the opinion of the Washington Observer.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Fickle Woman Dies Under Knife; Three Lovers Cause Uproar; Two Suspects Detained Pending Investigation <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>At 5:45 p.m. yesterday, a love triangle murder case occurred in the jurisdiction of the Yulin Road Police Station. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Du Defa, a man from Yangzhou, 30 years old, is currently working as a partner in the Jinlong Barber Shop at 120 Fuzhou Road. Nine years ago, he became acquainted with Wang Xiuying, a woman from the same hometown, and now lives with her in the front building at No. 23, Lane 181, Yulin Road, Hongkou, with a six-year-old son named Xiaogouzi. But although Xiuying is 34 years old, she is actually one of a</p>
<p>Fickle Woman</p>
<p>In addition to living with Du Defa, she also has two lovers behind the scenes: (1) Liu Linfu, a coppersmith from Yangzhou who lives at No. 183 Elcock Road, is 42 years old; (2) Zhou Yongcai, who works as a foreman at Huishan Wharf and lives at No. 15, Lane 181, Yulin Road. Liu and Zhou have been secretly interacting with Xiuying for many years, but Du Defa is absolutely unaware. On the 2nd of this month, Wang Xiuying suddenly claimed to Du Defa that she wanted to return to Yangzhou soon because her sister was sick. Du agreed. Du usually stays in the shop and</p>
<p>Does Not Return Home Often</p>
<p>When Du Defa returned home on the night of the 17th, he saw that Wang Xiuying was still there and had not gone to Yangzhou. He felt suspicious and thought that Wang had behaved improperly, so he started an argument. After a quarrel, the matter was put to rest. The next morning, Du still went to work in the shop. At 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, Du suddenly received a phone call from Liu Linfu, urging him to return home quickly. Du went back and entered the room, where he saw Liu and Wang Xiuying were both there. Liu said to Du, "Your wife is unfaithful and has been in love with Zhou Yongcai for two years. This time, Xiuying</p>
<p>Used the Excuse of Going to Yangzhou</p>
<p>But secretly lived with Zhou," etc. Du was furious when he heard this and interrogated Wang strictly, but Wang did not admit it, saying that she had nothing to do with Zhou, but had an ambiguous relationship with Liu. If he didn't believe it, he could go to Zhou's place to confront him. After confronting Zhou Yongcai, there was no result. On the morning of the 23rd, Liu invited Du out and went to the Fuyuan Tea House on Zhejiang Road to discuss and decided to buy a sharp triangular bayonet to kill Zhou Yongcai to vent their anger. Liu Linfu then bought the aforementioned bayonet from Mantingfang for two yuan and</p>
<p>Hid it on His Person</p>
<p>They returned home together and asked Wang Xiuying to go out to look for Zhou Yongcai. But Wang did not return for a long time after going out. Liu and Du then followed her out. At 5:00 p.m., they returned without finding Zhou. Unexpectedly, they saw that Wang Xiuying had returned alone. Du then argued with her, but Wang was strong and powerful, and Du was defeated and fell to the ground. He then called for Liu's help. Liu suddenly pulled out the bayonet and stabbed Wang's chest and abdomen several times, causing serious injuries. She immediately fell to the ground, and blood flowed into a river.</p>
<p>Barely Breathing</p>
<p>Neighbors Tao Fuwu and Ren Yuncai reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Detective Wu Jiwen to transport the injured to the Sacred Heart Hospital. She died before arriving at the hospital. The body was sent to the coroner's office. Du and Liu were taken to the police station along with the murder weapon. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the above situation, requesting a postponement because the coroner had not yet examined the body. When questioned, Du Defa admitted to fighting and calling for Liu's help, but did not instruct Liu to stab Wang Xiuying to death. Liu Linfu admitted that he had decided to kill Wang when discussing in Fuyuan, and did not intend to kill Zhou Yongcai. Judge Xiao ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody pending a further hearing in seven days. The body will be examined by the prosecutor's office and ordered to be placed in a coffin.</p>

<p>Hou Tonglian, a local woman residing at No. 702 Xiafei Road, is 32 years old, well-educated, beautiful, and gentle. She recently hired lawyer Xu Qinfu to file a petition with the Special Second Court, requesting a divorce from her husband, Chuan Dianying (currently teaching at Huadong Girls' High School, No. 2, Lane 462, Xiafei Road). It is said that the petitioner was introduced by Wu Fuxiang and Dai Yuchun on July 17 of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) and held a wedding ceremony at the Daji Building in Xiaodongmen, Nanshi. After marriage, the couple had a harmonious relationship and had one daughter and two sons. The family of five depended on the defendant for their livelihood. Unexpectedly, the defendant's attitude suddenly changed recently. He cohabited with a dancer, often leaving home and neglecting the lives of his mother and children. Although she had repeatedly negotiated with him, he ignored her. She had no choice but to file a petition for divorce. The court approved the petition. Yesterday, Judge Liao Yuan summoned both parties to court. After the petitioner stated the above situation, the defendant also appeared in court and stated that he had never delayed the petitioner's living expenses. He had recently been teaching at Huadong Girls' High School, and had not received his salary for two months, so difficulties arose. He firmly disagreed with the divorce. The court verified the statements and ruled that mediation was unsuccessful and that a formal lawsuit could be filed.</p>

<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Zhang Lingyun, the concerned party, the news articles published in your newspaper on the 11th and 22nd of this month regarding the "Extortion of Yongsheng Bank Assistant Manager Case" are not in accordance with the facts. Zhang Lingyun is only an ordinary employee of Yongsheng Bank and does not hold the title of Assistant Manager. Furthermore, the organization of Yongsheng Bank does not have an Assistant Manager position. The bank's lending practices are entirely in accordance with the small loan practices of major banks. The report alleging "usurious lending" is clearly malicious propaganda. The statement regarding "the truth" is also contrary to the facts. Regarding the record that "upon seeing that Bi was carrying a self-defense handgun, he feigned ignorance," Bi Haomin's confession to the police is clear and undeniable. The exaggeration and confusion are evident. The distortion of facts has a negative impact. Therefore, we have specifically requested your lawyer to send a letter for correction to clarify the record. We request that your newspaper investigate and publish this letter to the editor for correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Sun Shi'an, October 23rd.</p>

In the audience, after revisiting the legendary figure of Li Xiangjun, I remembered that in "Miscellaneous Records of Banqiao," there were characters even more proactive than Xiangjun. The first to come to mind was Ge Nen, who remained unyielding to the death, cutting her tongue and spitting blood. Her passionate and inspiring historical story made it necessary to turn it into a historical drama.</p>
<p>So, after returning home, I reread "Miscellaneous Records of Banqiao." From Ge Nen to Sun Kejian, from Kejian to Yu Manweng, Wang Weibo, and then from Manweng to Li Shiniang, from Weibo to Cai Ruheng, they became a series of inseparable figures. And these three pairs of characters seemed to represent three different tendencies; the Weibo-Ruheng pair was precisely the "antagonist." So, I decided to use these six people as the central characters, developing the entire history of the late Ming Dynasty based on this principle.</p>
<p>However, due to other work commitments, I only wrote three pages of the original manuscript and then put it aside. It was not until this spring that Mei Yi, the editor of "Huamei Morning Post" ("Langhua"), asked me to write a long story. I decided to take this opportunity to fulfill my wish. So, I worked on it in my spare time, completing two pages of the original manuscript each day and sending them for publication. Soon, Mei Yi returned to "Translation Report," and his successor was Yu You. I could not refuse, so I had to continue writing. In about two months, I completed two and a half acts. Unfortunately, "Huamei Morning Post" ceased publication, and the play was put aside again.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, inland theater troupes heard about the writing of this play and sent letters urging me to complete it. "China Travel" and "China Relief" looked forward to it eagerly, and "Shanghai Drama Society" had already announced it. Under pressure from all sides, I had to abandon other work and devote myself to organizing and continuing the unfinished parts. I revised it several times, completely changing the original draft.</p>
<p>This play has been assisted by comrades from the "Drama Society," as well as Liu Qiong, Zhang Zhizhi, Yan Fei, Zhao Shu, Fei Chong, and other friends. I am extremely grateful that it will have its premiere in Shanghai. What is particularly rare is that Ruoqing returned to Shanghai after three years away. She came to help as soon as she got off the train, rehearsing day and night, enduring great hardship. Alas! I really don't know how to thank her.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to thank Wu Yonggang for directing this play with great dedication; Xuan Gang for composing and arranging the music with careful consideration; and Mr. Liu Yazi for correcting many historical inaccuracies. I will never forget them.</p>
<p>The person who assisted in the completion of this play from beginning to end was Yu Ling; the person who gave me the greatest spiritual encouragement was Xia Yan, who is far away in Guilin. We shared life-and-death experiences last year, and I dare not express my gratitude. I will dedicate this play to him.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Introducing "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Tianwen</p>
<p>Since its performance of "Sai Jinhua," the Shanghai Drama Society has been rehearsing "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" and is also preparing to stage "Chen Yuanyuan." Staging historical dramas is indeed adapted to the environment of "this time, this place," but just as film companies compete to shoot costume dramas, we should critically accept the lessons of history and reflect reality as the main condition. Wei Ruhui's seriousness when adapting "Sai Jinhua" and his multiple revisions when writing "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" show a conscientious work ethic that is incomparable to those who sell pornography and arbitrarily "reproduce" works.</p>
<p>"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" was originally titled "Blood-Stained Flowers." The first two acts were published in "Langhua" in the "Huamei Morning Post." After the "Huamei Morning Post" ceased publication, the play was not continued. Recently, the Shanghai Drama Society was eager to rehearse the play, so the original author revised the first two acts and continued to write the third and fourth acts. During the time of revision and continuation, because the rehearsal was being rushed, the content was changed almost daily. Now that it is being performed, as stated in "Preamble to the Premiere of 'Blood-Stained Flowers'": It has completely changed its original appearance.</p>
<p>I have read the revised version of the first two acts. For the third and fourth acts, I have only seen the initial mimeographed version. After these two days of all-night rehearsals, there have probably been many more revisions. Now, I will introduce the general situation as follows:</p>
<p>The first act is set on the eve of Shi Kefa's martyrdom in Yangzhou and the fall of Nanjing. Sun Yaxian, a member of the Qingliu faction, indulges in sensual pleasures and falls in love with the famous courtesan Ge Nen'niang because he is jealous of Ma Shiying. However, Cai Ruheng, Ma Shiying's henchman, is constantly monitoring him. When the situation in Nanjing becomes critical, Cai Ruheng naturally becomes a "hero" who understands the times. Sun Kejian is determined not to leave Nanjing, but Ge Nen'niang is a thoughtful and far-sighted heroine. She forces him to leave Nanjing in the chaos by disfiguring herself and threatening to commit suicide.</p>
<p>The second act depicts the conflict between Zheng Zhilong and his son Zheng Chenggong. In Chenggong's reply to his father, he says, "The father betrays Ming, and the son is loyal to Ming. The father cannot force me!" It is after Ge Nen'niang asks for help and is humiliated, and Zheng's mother teaches her son to be loyal, that Zheng Chenggong abandons literature and takes up arms.</p>
<p>The third act is a reunion of old friends in Nanjing. They retreat to the mountains to resist the Qing army through guerrilla warfare. At this time, Cai Ruheng actually comes to persuade Ge Nen'niang to surrender with the argument of "Why must both sides be hurt?" But when the Qing army surrounds them on all sides, they all lead the masses in a vow.</p>
<p>The fourth act depicts the arrest of Sun Kejian and Ge Nen'niang. The Qing general Bolo is bewitched by Nen'niang's beauty and intends to "take her for himself." At the same time, Wang Weibo (who is Cai Ruheng's wife and should now be called Bolo's Chinese wife) also comes to persuade her. But Ge Nen'niang maintains her integrity. After Mei Niang kills Cai Ruheng with her own hands, she also cuts her tongue and bleeds to death.</p>
<p>When watching Zhou Xinfang's "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," I felt that the passing of a generation of emperors in such a way was moving. But reading about Ge Nen'niang of "Blood-Stained Flowers" cutting her tongue to curse the enemy and Sun Kejian calmly embracing righteousness makes one only feel resentment! Just as Ge Nen'niang said: "This is a blood debt!"</p>
<h3 id="e98">Scrip Coupons of the Three Major Companies <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Since the issuance of fractional currency notes, the streetcar company's scrip coupons have been gradually withdrawn. Many reputable large stores are also withdrawing the scrip coupons they have issued, but the scrip coupons of the three major companies, like those of the streetcar company, are scattered widely, mostly in the hands of small vendors. The coupons clearly state that they can only be used to purchase goods and cannot be exchanged for cash. However, these vendors will never have the opportunity to step through the doors of the companies. Therefore, these past two days, small vendors have been frequently negotiating with the companies, hoping that they can exchange the coupons for cash. "Sincere" and "Sun Sun" are considering their plight and have stipulated that small vendors be allowed to exchange the coupons at designated locations every morning. "Wing On" has not yet indicated their intention, but they will probably adopt the same method of cashing out. "Wing On" has never issued scrip coupons, but it is said that they collect fractional currency notes at 70 or 80 cents per dollar to use as change.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Learning Extramural Affairs, Reporters Enter a New Realm; Practicing Internal Affairs, the Academy Stages a Play.</p>
<p>Zhu Ai'ren agreed with a "yes." Therefore, the old doctor further instructed her: "When you arrive in Shanghai, observe and act accordingly. Don't rush back on Monday for the sake of things here. We will take care of the hospital and the infant home. You can rest assured. Even if you stay in Shanghai for another week or two, it won't matter. If there is anything urgent, you can call you. It would be best if you could invite Mrs. Su Maiya to come with you." On Saturday afternoon, they still took Zhu Ai'ren's car to Suzhou. These days, the autumn sky is high and clear, and the osmanthus is fragrant. The He sisters saw some villagers on the road using small handcarts to push baskets filled with fresh chestnuts. The He sisters, who grew up in the city, were not very familiar with rural products. But when autumn arrived, they often ate roasted chestnuts with sugar and other things from the market. They asked, "Sister Ai'ren! Aren't these fresh chestnuts? We only know about Liangxiang chestnuts from Tianjin, which are famous throughout the country. Do they also grow chestnuts here?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "The South also produces chestnuts, not just the North. When we were little, we only knew about eating Liangxiang chestnuts. Liangxiang is a county in Hebei province, and it is said that the chestnuts produced in Liangxiang are very small, both glutinous and sweet. Later, we learned that the place where chestnuts are produced in the North is not only Liangxiang, but also the several counties neighboring Liangxiang produce chestnuts. Not only in Hebei, but also in several places in Shandong, chestnuts are produced, and the chestnuts produced in some counties are even better than those in Liangxiang. However, people only know that Liangxiang produces famous chestnuts, so chestnuts from other places are also called Liangxiang chestnuts. Later, during the war, Liangxiang County was occupied, and it seemed that the South would no longer be able to eat Liangxiang chestnuts. But when the chestnuts went on the market, their signs still read 'Liangxiang,' which cannot but evoke a sense of sadness. In fact, many were not produced in Liangxiang, but their taste was no less than that of Liangxiang. It is strange that some people have moved our famous chestnut varieties to their own country, but the chestnuts produced are still not as good as ours. What is the reason for this? Some say it is due to the soil, others say it is due to the climate. I don't understand this, because I am not a horticulturist." He Liyu said, "Okay! We asked you one question, but you gave us a chestnut essay. We are just asking you, does Suzhou also produce chestnuts?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "Actually, I don't understand very well. I think: now that osmanthus chestnuts are on the market, they are probably from Changshu, right? I know that Changshu produces a kind of osmanthus chestnut, whose taste is no less than that of Liangxiang chestnuts in the North, and its shape is also very small, both sweet and glutinous. What's more, it has a kind of osmanthus fragrance, so it is called the osmanthus chestnut."</p>

<h3 id="e100">Fake "Bureau Chief" Li Dingshi's Bodyguards Mistakenly Kill a Prostitute, Sentenced to Prison, Two Bodyguards Each Sentenced to One and a Half Years <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Li Dingshi, the current fake "Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government," from Wuxing, held a banquet at the Meijuan brothel at 26 Pingwang Lane, Pingwang Street, on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at 9 PM. He invited "Municipal Government" advisor Ikeda Seiji, "Finance Bureau" advisor Kita Shoji, Special Affairs Agency head Sasaki, "Municipal Government" councilor Wang Changchun, "China Automobile Company" director Dong Ming, and others. In the midst of the celebration, three assassins suddenly came upstairs and opened fire on Li, wounding Ikeda and Kita. At the time, Li's bodyguards, Hu Changhai and Zhang Jianzhong, also fired shots after the incident. As a result, not only did the assassins not hit their target, but they also killed a prostitute named Xiao Qiaohong (real name Shen Sanbao). After receiving the report, the Old Zhabei Police Station sent Chinese detectives Wang Shusen and Zhang Bingchun to investigate. The police determined that the location of Hu and Zhang was the small room next to the stairway, which was the only way in and out for the assassins. Therefore, if Hu and Zhang had guarded the entrance at the time, none of the assassins would have escaped. However, Hu and Zhang did not do this. Several minutes after the assassins had fled, they randomly fired more than ten shots out of the window into the alley in an attempt to shirk their responsibility. Because Xiao Qiaohong was unjustly killed, Hu and Zhang should be held responsible for causing death by negligence. Therefore, the two men were detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoquan, explained the facts, stating that when the two defendants fired the shots, the assassins had long since fled. Although the two defendants wanted to shirk their responsibility at this time, they should have paid attention to whether there were people in the alley when they fired the shots. However, they randomly fired, causing the death of Xiao Qiaohong, which clearly constituted death by negligence. He requested that the court sentence them according to Article 176 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, the two defendants admitted that they fired at the assassins, but did not see Xiao Qiaohong. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and sentenced Hu Changhai and Zhang Jianzhong to one year and six months of imprisonment each for causing death by negligence as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e101">What is Expected of the Drama League <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>The professional drama circles in this city are planning to organize a drama league. This league is initiated by Gu Menghu, Chen Qiufeng, Dong Tianmin, Zhang Siwei, Zhang Yezhi, Li Zhuan, and others, and is currently being actively prepared.</p>
<p>The main reason for organizing the drama league is that newly emerging theater troupes in the city are often heard of, but they disband soon after their establishment. Their organizations are so unsound that a group is needed to connect them and make up for the shortcomings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the most important thing for the establishment of a theater troupe is a sound organization. Otherwise, it will not be sustainable and achieve considerable success. Therefore, we believe that the organization of the drama league by the professional drama circles has considerable significance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in addition to hoping that the organization of the drama circles is sound, we also hope that every professional drama group can recognize the mission that the drama circles should bear. Everyone can make the drama progress and must not cater to low-level interests, so that the drama still cannot escape the category of civilized drama, or even move backward.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel that the ticket prices for the plays staged by various theater troupes in Shanghai have been set too high recently. High ticket prices cannot be widespread, so many people who love to watch plays cannot afford to see them because of the ticket prices. The professional drama circles cannot ignore this point, right?</p>
<h3 id="e102">The "China Travel" Star, Ms. Tang Ruoqing, Arrives in Shanghai Quietly: A Meeting Record <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Beini</p>
<p>The news of Tang Ruoqing's arrival in Shanghai was initially unbelievable because everyone knew that she had accepted an invitation from overseas Chinese in Nanyang to perform abroad; however, no one expected that she had quietly arrived in Shanghai two weeks ago!</p>
<p>In order to get some news about the Hong Kong theater scene and also to meet this actress who had been away from Shanghai for more than two years, the reporter visited her at the Shanghai Drama Society one afternoon when it was raining continuously. She graciously answered many questions that people on the isolated island did not know, and also talked about her recent situation. The following is a record of the interview:</p>
<p>I (Tang said herself) The last play I performed in Hong Kong was Mr. Yu Ling's "Women's Apartment." It was a performance to raise disaster relief funds. The venue was the "Queen's Theater." The script was rewritten by Mr. Xia Yan based on the situation in Hong Kong. I played the role of Liu Lizhu. The director was Mr. Fei Mu. The general situation was very good; after finishing "Women's Apartment," I was invited to go south. At that time, the situation in Europe was already urgent. I was stopped when I left for Haiphong and had to return to Hong Kong. At that time, my sister Xiangqing wanted to return to Shanghai to study, and she wanted me to accompany her to Shanghai. It just so happened that I also had some things to take care of in Shanghai, so I decided to accompany her to Shanghai. I originally didn't want anyone to know, but as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I was discovered by several familiar friends and invited to perform in Shanghai as a guest performer.</p>
<p>"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" is a historical drama that Mr. Wei Ruhui recently finished writing. On the third day after I arrived in Shanghai, I met Mr. Wei. Mr. Wei said, "Shanghai Drama Society" is going to perform this play recently, but the role of Ge Nen'niang is still vacant, and they must find me to play it. However, I didn't plan to perform in Shanghai, but under the insistent invitation of Mr. Wei and several heads of the Shanghai Drama Society, I couldn't refuse their kindness, so I agreed. I spent a day reading the entire script and felt that the meaning and technique of the script were very good. The director of this play is Mr. Wu Yonggang. This is the first time I have worked with Mr. Wu.</p>
<p>"Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" has already begun rehearsals and is scheduled to be staged on the 25th.</p>
<p>As for my future plans, it's really hard to say. However, after "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," I plan to leave Shanghai and return to Hong Kong. On the one hand, my sister's studies in Shanghai have been arranged, and on the other hand, some miscellaneous matters can be concluded. After a long conversation of one hour, the reporter hurriedly said goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e103">A Record of a Theatrical Performance at the Yu Residence <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Yesterday, the grandson of Mr. Yu Qiaqing held his wedding at the New Capital Hotel, and there was a grand theatrical performance. Because those attending the performance were all "star players" from various theaters, it caused quite a sensation. The New Capital Theater, which wasn't very large, was packed.</p>
<p>The stars from the Tianchan Stage were the first to perform. Liu Hanchen, Xue Youqin, Gao Xueqiao, and others rushed back to the Tianchan to perform after singing "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness." However, after "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness" ended, originally it was supposed to be Chu Xiaolinghong's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet." However, Xiaolinghong was unable to arrive on time due to unfinished business regarding gold, so, helplessly, filler acts were performed. There were two filler acts by small clowns: "Breaking the Casserole" by Liu Binkun and Han Jinkui, and "Escorting the Bride and Performing Rituals" by Han Jinkui.</p>
<p>After dinner, "Arresting Cao Cao" continued the performance. Mr. Zhao Peixin's Chen Gong and Qi Junqing's Lü Boshe, all those participating in the Yu residence performance were professionals. Only Zhao and Qi were amateurs. Mr. Zhao's voice is becoming increasingly clear and bright, with a multitude of excellent tones, pleasing to the ear. Even professionals can't match it. Mr. Wang has recently shifted away from specializing in the Kylin style. Although playing the supporting role of Lü Boshe, his light and understated portrayal was just right. He is, after all, an old hand, and his performance was anything but ordinary. Paired with Li Kechang's Cao Cao, it was even more perfect.</p>
<p>After "Arresting and Releasing Cao Cao" came the masterpiece starring three female Dan roles: Wu Suqiu's "Chunxiang Makes a Scene at School," Xiao Linghong's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," and Zhang Shuxian's "Xin'an Inn." Suqiu's makeup was beautiful, and her expressions and actions as Chunxiang were extremely wonderful. The audience all admired Suqiu's artistry. After "Chunxiang Makes a Scene at School" came Xiao Linghong's "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet." Xiao Linghong's appearance was extraordinarily beautiful, capable of astonishing the audience. She was indeed a beauty. Although her fame and status are not as high as Suqiu's, her performance was no less wonderful than Suqiu's. The Liu Matchmaker from the Three Provinces was particularly "remarkable," with countless body movements, exquisitely detailed. After "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" came Zhang Shuxian's "Xin'an Inn." Because Zhang's stage performance had not yet finished, she was unable to arrive in time, so "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" was delayed and lasted until nine quarters of the hour. Zhang Shuxian has not been in Shanghai for long since arriving from Tianjin. Watching her perform "Xin'an Inn," one can see that her art has considerable foundation and she is not a mediocre person. Shuxian's makeup is slightly lacking, but her martial arts skills are quite commendable, her body movements are also good, and she is good at acting. She can be considered a talent of medium caliber.</p>
<p>The most captivating performance of the evening was undoubtedly the "Battle of Changsha" by Kirin Boy (Zhao Ruquan) and Yuan Shihai. Xin Fang and Ruquan are the giants of Southern opera performers. When two heroes meet, it is not only a match made in heaven, but also Shihai's imposing painted face, which has always been highly praised, complementing each other like a peony and green leaves. That evening, from beginning to end, all three spared no effort, and the audience applauded thunderously. Mr. Yu Qiaqing sat in a corner of the stage, cheering repeatedly, and its brilliance was beyond words. The grand finale was Song Dezhu's "Flooding Jinshan Temple," Dezhu's signature play. It was different in style from the Battle of Changsha, each with its own strengths. The performance ended at four in the morning.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Grand Opening of Dahua is Scheduled <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Que Li</p>
<p>The long-rumored Dahua Cinema is scheduled to open on January 22nd, and the construction project will be completed by the 10th of next month. Because the cinema has a long-term contract with MGM, it will exclusively screen MGM's new films from now on. There are currently twenty of them in stock, ready to be screened in sequence. The opening premiere is Jeanette MacDonald's singing film "Broadway Serenade." The next film to be screened is the three-million-dollar Technicolor epic "The Wizard of Oz" (starring Judy Garland). As for "Gone With The Wind," a collaborative effort by Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Vivien Leigh, it will be screened at the end of this year. The long-awaited literary masterpiece "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" (Robert Donat's immortal work) will not arrive in Shanghai until after March.</p>
<p>Prelude to Iron Horse</p>
<p>"Iron Horse" is Paramount Cecil B. DeMille's fifty-sixth masterpiece. This film has considerable historical and educational value. It is said that in the past, tea from China to the eastern United States had to be shipped via South America. Later, when the Union Pacific Railroad was built, it could be shipped directly from the west to the east. President Lincoln always signed A. Lincoln, but when approving this railroad, he specially signed his full name, Abraham Lincoln, which shows how much he valued the railroad. The above picture shows the three main characters in Iron Horse. (Paul)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Anecdotes from the Pear Garden <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Gold and Silver Issue in the Ulong Courtyard Play</p>
<p>However, there are many words that sound the same but have different characters, which requires a lot of guessing. For example, the second sentence above, according to the original meaning, is picking up some chicken feathers to make a feather duster. However, these words come from the mouth of a useless teacher, and he knows that the thug disciples he leads are even more useless than him, so even though he is leading a group of people to capture Xiao En, it is nothing more than gathering some courage (dust). Similarly, in the play "Ulong Courtyard," Song Dezhu (playing Xi Jiao) also had a disagreement with Third Master Song that day. When Song Jiang asked Xi Jiao for the gold in the Zhao Wen pouch, Dezhu responded, "The old lady is going down the steps, squatting (crouching)." This is also a saying with a hidden meaning. According to the literal meaning, because the old lady is old, her joints are stiff, and her hands and feet are not flexible, when going down the steps, with one foot up and one foot down, if she is a little flustered, she will often squat her waist and hold her breath. Therefore, the Dan performer used "cun (store/save/deposit) squatting" with the same sound to answer the male role, saying that the gold called me to store it. In fact, according to the old saying, it means "I have accepted the gold." If Dezhu had learned Cuihua's play, then this line would probably be recited according to Cuihua's original line. My point is that while it is appropriate for junior performers to learn from their predecessors, they must first judge what should be learned and what should not be learned. They must thoroughly understand the plot before making a choice. Dezhu is from a school, so her knowledge is naturally higher than that of ordinary actors. Take, for example, what I said above, "He insisted on changing the line to, 'I'll keep the silver ingot for Third Brother to buy candy.'" In fact, he didn't think about it. Does the real Xi Jiao not even know the difference between gold and silver? Examining his intention, it is nothing more than the originator wanting to add a witty touch, and saying to take a gold ingot to buy candy would be inappropriate, so he devalued the gold and changed it to silver.
