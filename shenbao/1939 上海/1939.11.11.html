<h3 id="c23">評投機 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>上海向以投機市塲著稱於國內，而不知平時所謂投機也者，大都尚集中於交易所市塲，，自八一三戰事發生之後，其範圍始漸擴大，由外滙黃金外幣棉紗麵粉而布疋米糧乃至日用各物，幾無一不成爲投機目的物。及歐戰作，投機之興趣愈濃厚，凡屬洋貨亦不論其爲牛搜馬渤無不兼收並蓄，一度稱在盛。惟公債一項，向爲投機家所注視，近則常隨局勢而異其弛張，不復成爲投機之重心，然而資金逃避之心理，僥倖致富之企圖，固未嘗不熱熾於一般投機者之心頭。本年以來，外商股票乃成爲投機分子唯一之恩物。時聞發見新高價，不久又成爲陳迹。允以瑞鎔耶松兩船廠，會得豐開平煤礦，怡和紗廠，國際信託，中國墾殖，中國鋼業，上海銀公司各股所漲爲最速；橡皮股方面，若英古達徐，若英楂華，若標地，上漲亦鉅；其他各股，均有同樣之趨勢：此輓近投機事業之輪廓也。</p>
<p>近兩年來，投機之風所以披猖者，則以物價逐步上騰，迄無平落之望；有所圖莫不有所獲，因是鼓起居奇囤積之風，即小有資產，亦思拼凑染指；投機致富者，更出其盈利，轉輾搏揜，所嚮復無不利，方自詡其預測不謬，億則屢中，而望其改弦易轍，求物價之平準，戞戛乎其難矣</p>
<p>由是觀之，投機無戢止之望，蓋爲局面不安定，而投機所以盛行也。然亦有不可爲投機作如是樂觀之論據在。原夫投機者之心理，自必抱有「動皆中於機會，以取勝於當世」之信心，不然，何必投？既具此信心矣，而不知彼所投之機會也者，是吾能如其信心所預測？苟或不能，則折足覆餗之失敗隨之；苟或其然，一本而數利，欣欣然色喜而神怡，又能保其得意不再往乎？往則能保其仍可操奇計贏乎？况悖而入者悖而出，固比此皆是也。歐戰之始。上海人士搜羅洋貨，無微不至，豈止一日數漲，曾幾何時，彼自許可成爲若民初歐戰時之富翁者，莫不失望，甚至虧折不貲，無他，以今日之情况，模擬舊時，是昧於時機者也。不問其市塲貨物之多寡，不明其平時消費之實况，盲人瞎馬，爭相羅致，及至事過境遷，方悟所操持者，雖不儘爲無用之物，要皆爲呆滯之貨，是又忽於事機者也。當斷不斷，反受其殃，投機所以多失敗，正坐此故。越賤越賣越貴越買，方自許爲市塲之俊；而不念累積愈厚，輕船重載，在風巨浪之來，能保其不傾覆者乎？此又不戒於貪機之爲害也。蓋既名曰機，機者稍縱即逝；既命爲投。投則豈能必中，甚矣投機之難也。故世有投機起家者乎？有之亦絕少數，煊赫於一時，失敗於俄頃，此又投機市塲所習見不鮮。且投機者多心存僥倖，故常聽命於星相術士，爲所愚弄而不覺，爲所欺騙而不悟，投機而取決於星命，是不明投機性質作用之爲何，而上海之投機分子，大率如是，固知其非有眞知灼見者也。</p>
<p>吾人所以爲投機分子危慮者，蓋惟今日之上海市塲，固爲投機居奇者所把持，故囤貨出售，則市價立平；稍有搜羅，則漲勢洶湧。行市則愈抬而愈高，宜爲投機者所暗喜，但一問貴價格之囤貨，有多少成交者乎？衡其實際，大都有行而無市。况如股票之爲物，自有其限額，抬之愈高，賣者或以空額過鉅而不能繳貨，買者或以價額過高而無力收貨，即以高價格購進之股票，收平常之利率，是亦未爲計之得者也。滬上生活高貴，固有其特殊原因在，而投機者之揚波助瀾，亦所以促成之。獨不念投機者之所謂利，大都猶在鏡花水月之間，即使盡如投機者之心願，少數獨富，衆人皆貧，不知所謂富者固何爲耶！於是而知投機者之憬悟爲不容緩矣。</p>

<p>「江海關監督」李建南、企圖阻止中國法幣進口後、各國領事及外商銀行堅決反對、置之不理、該監督又擬管理法幣之運輸、謂因正當需要、欲運法幣進口、應事前得其允許、但各外商銀行對於此項所謂一管理」決亦不予理睬、至於江海關羅稅務司、始終並未下令禁止及管理、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、「該監督」之企圖阻止法幣進口、旨在推行其「華興券」、所謂管理者、亦爲阻止之一法、蓋「華興券」自稱以英匯六辦士爲標準、故江海關之一收稅處」每日公佈之折合價格、「華興券」較法幣爲高、今因上海外匯黑市轉鬆、英滙已近六辦士、法幣價格將在「華興券」以上、使「華興券」受到極大之打擊、故企圖阻止法幣、促成外匯黑市之波動、並以防止法幣通貨膨脹爲美名、實則中國法幣發行、始終謹眞、現金準備、依然充足、政府從未乞靈紙幣政策、毫無通貨膨脹之現象、</p>
<p>字林報云、昨日（九日）聞諸負責方面、「新政府」所委海關監督李建南近致上海領事團各領事之函件、並非述及「禁止」華方各銀行紙幣之進出口、而係志在「統制各銀行經營的貨幣之行動」、領事團對李氏之函、尚未答覆、</p>
<p>並非阻撓法幣進口</p>
<p>李建南頃告記者稱、關於渠致函各領事之消息、已發生誤解、頗爲抱憾、渠之目的、非在禁止法幣進出口、僅欲統制各銀行、允其爲運大量法幣來滬的外國銀行開之貨幣行動而巳、從事運幣來滬之銀行、若先向渠申請「許可」則亦能達其目的、</p>
<p>所謂加以適當利用</p>
<p>又若入口之法幣、加以適當利用、則將給予許可、此事多與外國銀行有關、蓋華方銀行未運數額足以引起渠注意之大量法幣來滬也、此項命令之初旨、在求上海「市塲與貿易之福利」、因銀行紙幣過多、將發生「膨脹」也云、記者問實行統制、有無困難、李氏答稱、此乃另一問題云、</p>
<p>統制傳說亦不確實</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、李建南昨日切實吾認「維新政府」已禁止上海法幣之進出口、並稱、外傳海關當局今取統制貨幣之方法一說、並不確實、所頒條規、絕無禁止法幣進出口之意義、而係槪述通貨之行動、須加統制、故今所取者、乃統制的而非禁止的方法、</p>
<p>偽方目的須先申請</p>
<p>去歲海白銀進出口、有各種無限制之行動、今則有大量紙幣在轉移中、大多係在香港運輸出入、渠致領袖領事之函中、概述必須遵從之條規、並說明不准秘密運輸法幣、無論中外銀行爲商業用途而欲輸入或運出法幣者、須先向「海關監督」申請許可、各銀行必須證明此等法幣係自己用以經營商業者、「海關」認爲已遵條規、而款項並非用作市塲投機之用、則將加以許可、</p>
<p>大通紙幣絕未扣留</p>
<p>致各領事之函、係用華文繕寫、日期為十月四日、促請各銀行為本身與上海市場及貿易利益計、應運從條規云、李氏答覆關於披亞士總統號輪上週運來紙幣約千萬元、略遭扣事稱、大通銀行於此等紙幣首途運來時、已申請入口之準許、海於法幣抵海關碼頭時啟箱檢查、終乃通過、</p>

<p>字林報云、上海自楊樹浦以至極司斐爾區、目下罪案與不法行動迭起、公共租界與法租界警察處偵緝罪犯問題、極爲困難、允其爲公共租界當局轄外之滬西界外區、已成大罪行之發生地、與若干最兇惡暴黨之匿跡與藏械地、</p>
<p>逮捕搜臟發生困難</p>
<p>昨（九日）記者探悉、「特別市府」對公共租界警務處、極少或並未給予合作、以追捕匿跡界外馬路區內之暴黨或罪犯、故警務處雖確知要犯之所在地、但常不能加以逮捕或破獲贓物、</p>

<p>警告日本</p>
<p>切勿以爲在華戰事幾已勝利、據稱日軍雖已佔據廣州等城市、但日本在華任務、並未完畢、廣州市內與四週之實况、與日本國內一般人所相信者</p>
<p>大不相同</p>
<p>、日兵刻仍備嘗許多艱難、日本國內人民以爲大戰今已過去、日兵得享安適、實則日兵仍甚活動、縱在目前、敵人仍在廣洲四週來往、並非小股游擊隊、而係數萬</p>
<p>正規軍隊</p>
<p>扼守堅固之戰壕甲、彼等不絕注意克復廣州之機緣、日軍前哨幾每日遭彼等襲擊、彼等乘熟悉地形之利、入夜即取攻勢、被攻擊時則分散如蠅、但迅即復返、重行作戰、大亞灣登陸與進佔廣州時大戰中之</p>
<p>日兵傷亡</p>
<p>數、遠較該市被佔後歷决戰役中傷亡之日兵爲少、敵人雖傷亡較重、但在多决劇戰中、日軍當然不能無損失云、按玉井勝乘軍曹所著「麥與兵」「泥與兵」及「花與兵」三書、行銷極廣、</p>

<p>電力公司結進</p>
<p>後市初因電力公司前來扒結、市象曾帶緊軟、英金至五辦士〇九三七五、美匯達八元一二五、入後狀况轉寂、情勢遂稍回硬、聞美行大通吐予同行現貨美匯八元一八七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士一八七五、美匯八元一八七五、本月份英金五辦士一七一八七五、美匯八元一五六二五、結果比上日現期英均鬆〇一二五、美則反俱緊〇三一二五、</p>

<p>烚赤僅跌十三元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外匯步便、致局勢亦隨之趨疲、開市即做小五十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲三千六百八十元、繼因匯市仍報鬆動、且銀樓帮與錢兌業等均前來拋出、故再降小三十元、錢兌業　予金號十兩、爲三千六百五十元、時某銀樓代港帮發動採辦、兼某金號亦代投機商搜買、且同時外滙回軟、不久即回起七十元、某銀樓進證券帮三十兩、爲三千七百二十元、後證劵帮與散戶等力售、未幾忽降落三十元、錢兌業互做四十兩、爲三千六百九十元、此後某錢兌業忽起買風、猛進二百餘兩、重父做高至三千七百二十元、旋以外匯復報硬化、賣勢頓濃、現金號與錢兌業及銀　帮等爭先求售、加以客帮中止吸進、乃不支　暴落四十五兀、金號吐予錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百七十五元、後某金號前來拉提、市勢轉穩、步漲十餘元、迨至收盤時、某銀號與金號亦來撈入、且外匯已止鬆轉平、故再抬起十餘元、某余號進證券帮四十兩、爲三千七百〇五元作午收價、午後初開堅挺、開市即高二十五元、某銀樓進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千七百一二十元、嗣證券帮力售百餘兩、遂回落十五元、證券帮賣予銀樓帮五十兩、爲三千七百十五元、其時外匯步緊、加以某證券帮亦來搜買、且港帮統有吸進、遂再飛漲三十元、證券帮進錢兌業三十兩、爲三千七百四十五元、此後銀樓帮乘機套，賣、某金號亦多頭了結、且外匯回鬆、步降三十元、銀樓帮互做二十兩、爲三千七百十五元、入後某錢兌業拉提、高起十五元、錢兌業互做十兩、爲三千七百三十元、後因散戶吐出、復小十三元、錢兌業叉互做二十兩、爲三千七百十七元作晚收價、結果比上日回跌上三元、全天九十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進的减低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百八十元、迨至九時三十五分掛小五元、此後未變化、結果大同行改懸三百七十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均减小十五元之譜、</p>

<p>證券暗盤昨日市況、因人心不振、趨勢仍屬疲軟、跌勢雖覺稍殺、仍絲毫無生氣、惟述日跌落已三元數角、浮空漸漸增加、亦需愼防反動、因　面壓力已見鬆懈、買賣均無甚精彩、或於一度醞釀後再見活動也、昨日情形、上午初開多方稍事拉抬、市價稍堅、仍以賣氣較濃、緩步下游、午收仍比隔日爲低、午後交易較淸、供方仍比求方爲多、再小一一角、形勢略和緩、結果續小二角至四角、丁種因除中籤關係、獨小九角半、成交總數的計四五十寓元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>連漲兩日之紗市、昨則因外匯盤旋、致投機家鬆勁、買意不固、較上日大爲掃興、因之市盤下降、但實需雖無大量發展、然港帮對於十支粗紗納胃尚稱不弱、不過多數均向廠方直接開售、而價格允廉、此項棉紗投機人手貨素不多捏、故影響市面不大、惟二十支細紗交易仍遲滯冷澹之中、二十支雙馬收盤以後做小至六百四十八元、比上日要跌十二元之譜、其他紗價和平、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、聞外匯有趨鬆消息、一般搶帽子之流爭先喊賣、價格一跌十元、二十支雙馬始做六百五十八元、少頃逐步下堕至六百五十元、但客帮反有賣出雙馬、掉進十支粗紗、於此細紗疲而粗紗昂、查半日間成交統計九百十五包、上日成效一千四百十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌六元半、雙地球跌七元、天女跌五元、廠方由崇信廠開出二十一支大發四百包、價爲六百二十元、十支大發二百包、價五百十五元、統益廠開出二十支金鷄一百包、價六百三十元、一三支金鷄一百包、價爲六百三十五包、、永安廠開出十支　金城一百五十包、價爲五百五十元、今日有紗一百三十五件運厦門、又一百八十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<p>本棉交易雖則不薄、然　係同業成交、賣價稍形帶昂、廠方　包未曾成交、市面依然穩定、海外印美棉市轉佳、日見前進、無奈外匯轉趨平靜、人心仍屬寗謐、蘇北來源、計通花一千二百三十包、北沙來二百七十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、（成交價格均係鈔票棧交）</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因匯兌之捉摸不定、廠方較爲靜寂、同業間頗有意購買、惟不知將如何着手也、日商廠亦殊爲靜寂、若有所期待然、甘前美棉業已裝運在途者、的有數萬包、將於月底月初决第到滬矣、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初即形活躍、利物浦及孟買來電俱告良好、因棉花貸款條例之通過、人心異常興奮、因之市況異常活躍、引起各方有力之購買及一部份空頭之抵補、結果收盤價格較之上日激漲十餘磅音、印度連同預測漲九羅比餘、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦漲三十餘便士、</p>

<p>昨日客尖市續見上漲、蓋以到貨仍斷、及一般心思家趁勢拉進、晨間開手、即有囤戶出手搜辦、致一霎微細之市貨、頓去大半、而行情立提半元、不過本鄉去路平常、所以結果已不若前市之轟動、計收盤江北尖二十四元二角至二十三兀八角、京蕪特尖二十四元二三角至二十三元半、餘如新粳等各貨昨共到蘇嘉崑太楓靑等貨二十餘車、銷塲方面、一般估客因見客尖一路上升、新粳價標準已較低廉、大都暢辦、而客販亦不肯輕脫、故市面並屬反平回升較增四五角、蘆羊尖跟高二三角、窰菉種及變元悉屬帶緊也、統市成交數八千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈昨市再見上騰、江北秈存底將枯、後運未到、蕪湖秈雖有華商行販與日商合作搬運之傳、但迄今尚乏整批抵埠、即日商大戶亦無大量運到、而當地市價則已逐决跟砌、因此晨間開市已形挺秀、旋有大戶行囤吸收二千多包、便乃頓時飛漲五六角、江北秈喊價已至二十四元有零、而蕪秈則至二十四元三角、消化除囤戶外、客鄉舖作亦頗活潑、成交亦有二千多包、惟後市客囤以價碼過高停辦、形勢又見盤軟云、</p>

<p>小麥來源寥寥、市塲供給亦感缺乏、買賣雙方、仍有檳持狀態、廠胃不貪、新囤戶亦不願高價收買、結果市塲交易告寂而阜豐廠抑價辦進管店常錫京蕪等麥共二寓包左右、價十一元三角至十元零九角二分、較前已貶小二三角、</p>

<p>— 培初</p>
<p>現代精神中最顯著的一點，恐怕要算幹吧。所謂幹，就是說得到，做得到，不怕什麽阻擋，一定要達到成功的意思。我們現代的文明，就是前人幹的成績。</p>
<p>前天我也去參觀了一决語文展覽會，感覺到了幹的另一種意義，那是關於文化的。在這會中，我對於聖經公會所展覽的聖經，看得最久。牠不但將世界各國各種語言的聖經展覽給我們看，並且將我們中國各種方言的聖經展覽給我們看。在這裏面，除了我們所易見的寗波，厦門，或其他城市的方言以外，更有我們西南，西北，東北一帶特種方言的聖經，這些方言，幾乎是我們從來所沒有聽見過的。我眞不能不佩服西來傳敎士幹的精神！</p>
<p>西敎士，在我們說來，正和我們的僧道一樣，以傳敎為業，也是不務俗事的世外人。旣是世外人，在我們看來，也和我們的僧道一樣，儘可以習習靜，享享福，不必多所營謀，自討苦吃。然而他們不然。他們要幹。他們旣能深入不毛之地，奇險之地，宣傳敎義，也更能在這些地方，同時宣傳文化。他們刊行了這些特種方言的聖經！他們作敎士的還如此，專以俗事為務的非敎士，努力的幹，更不必說了，難怪他們在精神和物質上，都超過了我們。</p>
<p>因此，我就回過來想想我們自己，有許多應幹之事，我們不是在橫加阻礙，使人怕幹，或者受到牽掣，就此不幹麽？別的不要說，就以新文字而論，正和特種方言聖經差不多的事情，我們有了什麼成統呢？為什麽我們要和他們相差到這樣遠呢？而這特種方言的工作，還正是我們所應該担負的。</p>
<p>不過我到底不是要作灰心之論，失望之語。我們現在都已經知道幹了，有許多事正在幹起來，或者正在幹下去。語言展覽，正可以說是幹的一種！</p>
<h3 id="c112">媽媽 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 笑蘋</p>
<p>街上的擾雜聲漸漸地沉入夜色中去。</p>
<p>雨——無休止紛亂地飄落在寂靜的街頭。</p>
<p>從昏闇疲憊的街燈四周，我糢糊地看到細長的雨絲。十月二十九日被夜神悄悄地拖了去，三十日在黑暗中掙扎着來。</p>
<p>是這樣寂靜的一個秋的雨夜，我匆促的踏着紛亂的步子，踏過被幾百幾千幾萬萬點細微的雨點打濕了的道路急速回家。</p>
<p>鐵門子關得貼貼緊緊的鋪子，緩緩地在我身邊退縮過去，很快就要逼近我的家。</p>
<p>兩隻黑眼圈，一張冷峻的媽媽底臉，出現在我的眼前。她每因晚歸的女兒而抑鬰着；這時聽着頻頻愁煩的雨聲，不知怎樣的懷念着她還未歸家的女兒而焦急與憤恨呵。</p>
<p>我淸楚的意識到，現在她為着女兒的「變」痛苦着，有時不能忍耐，就向著她痛愛的女兒不是出於心願的發怒。可是我心愛著，絲毫沒有一些兒對她恨，媽媽是我永愛着的媽媽，媽媽說我是女孩子，那能出遠門呢。但女孩子也應有著光明的前途的啊，在這時代中。永不會像媽媽的時代了……</p>
<p>但我也不是存心要離開她的。</p>
<p>為了爸爸的早死，她在艱難的軟弱的生活鬥爭中撫養大她的女兒——我。時常為著不健康多病的女兒流眼淚。十多年來封建家庭給予她的祇是冷酷，白眼，要挾；她巳飽嘗人世間的慘痛。她僅有唯一的女兒能安慰她，她的希望也緊緊繫在一個女兒的身上，滿望着將來能過着如意的生活。</p>
<p>如今——</p>
<p>她是失望了，女兒漸漸還離她的希望，破滅了她卞多年來對女兒的期望。</p>
<p>媽媽的苦臉帶來了我的苦悶，我時刻的思素着，我怎樣去安慰我世界上最愛的媽媽？我不能使她創傷了的心兒再受痛楚。一决，又一决，再一次的思索，我失敗了。</p>
<p>苦痛刺進我的心，腦海中充滿了疑難。我怎樣去說服媽媽，以及那一天使媽媽能了解她的女兒，成為高爾基筆下的「母親」。</p>
<p>我這樣彷徨在街頭。雨仍是那麼蕭蕭地。</p>
<h3 id="c113">秋與寒江 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>只要我閉齊一下眼睛，我就不能忘記。眼睛上浮起一片虛白，光輝不耀眼，偏是那麼幽雅，沈靜，柔和。儼然我能想像一條浩森無垠的大江，水天交際處，晴光給渲染上畫幅，一片蔚藍更一條帶形的綠。神鴉社鼓，多年來不見了，蜘蛛偷偷地擺滿一屋的陣勢。在厚厚的灰塵下，埋葬了楹漆的朱紅。你聞得着滿地的雀穢。偶然有幾片瓦墮落在佛龕旁，給灰塵蒙蓋了，從遠方送來一聲沈默的鐘，便又斜着身體聽雀兒在樑上喳喳地呌。彷彿秋來時是從江北邊，或寒江上，住在江城的人感覺得秋天較早，而一座破敗的山叉最適宜於秋。當蘆荻被風吹拂得蕭蕭起伏時，當村落的無邊木葉被染黃時，江城的街上，你看見每人穿上厚厚的夾衣。破敗的山中的廟宇，整天沒有幾個遊客，亭子中石凳台桌，也更冷得像冰，乖巧一些你莫坐下了，瀟洒新晴，澄江似練，寒江的蕭條帶來一城秋意，……</p>
<p>突然平靜的波浪顫慄了。有這麽一天，黑夜風高時，我們聽到許多無辜者的哭泣。在十月，一艘帆船中，大江南北岸，我度過十幾天江上的生涯。在點綴着星星燈光的夜幕中，灰色的江上投下浮屠龐大的身影。夜裹我們聽得出在吼的濤聲撞擊在船上，一浪接連一浪。朝嵐初開的蕭瑟的早晨，山色蒼然，風高天急，我不能說我再愛寒江了，心瑟縮的感不到一絲溫暖。　葭蒼蒼的破曉，瘦條的枝兒，搖擺在灰空，一頭犬在吠着寒冷。船舷上滑溜溜，像鋪上一層薄冰。叢林的黑影包圍了一個小小的村落；板門裹有疎燈，橋下纜船處，也亮着一兩盞「煤油罩」，幌喲幌，在方洞門框上。剪刀一般銳利的夜風，穿過船板的罅縫，刺痛臉。偶然把眼睛從窗洞外望過去，一片沈沈的黑暗啊。故鄉的水流不到這兒來？人人從黑影中想探索一切未知的神秘，然而又都失望了。港汶迥環的江，曲折得有些古怪。村落的前後左右，白茫茫的水，點着篙子，船擺過去了，東邊的老兒給西岸的孩子攙進屋去。一天天岸上的樹葉比以前更黃了，穿上棉袍子的人也還要晒太陽了，江風砭骨，江水也更寒，十天船上的生涯把殘秋銷麽得沒有一筆影子。你說那也是平靜的秋，僥有秋意的寒江嗎？呵，不是了，不是了。一决寒江的流離，在蕭條十月中，我寫下「懷鄉」的字在江上，在秋天的黃葉上。我懷戀江城。我不能忘記一段心境的秋，秋天的江，江上的憂鬰啊。</p>
<p>度過兩個秋天了呵，在這大都市。當敎堂的塔尖在晚風中更顯得陰鬰時，江上的秋也深了。流動在高聳的建築物街中，風在吼着，捲成像疾溜一樣的漩渦。外灘附近的街上，陽光稀薄得像冬天。江面的風吹來遙遠的夢幻，眸子上浮起了一層虛白，再堆起惆悵，像陰雲。在艨艟巨艦紛陳凑泊的岸邊，我看得見那一片江，寒江上的秋意。</p>
<p>堆在厚厚的灰塵中了，多年平靜的江，秋天的，江城的，神鴉社鼓，佛狸祠下，……我不能說我再愛寒江了。料峭的十月天，茫茫江上，濤之夜，霜之晨，生命像一粒螞蟻在熱鍋上奔走，那流離的酸辛啊！從水郭昏燈的小城到一個海邊的大都市，我遍地找尋那失去的秋。秋從寒江來，深了又殘了，一年，兩年，三年。也許你從外灘旁想像一點故鄉江城的風景吧，可是那失去的秋呢，—從騷擾中，你該向那兒奪回一份安靜？</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>過往我們知道好萊塢的影片公司對於中國，每多隔膜之處，而辱華影片，更時常有得發現，甚至在辱華性質的影片之中，更物色中國籍的影星來飾演恥辱的角色。黃柳霜不是已往曾飾過不少此種角色嗎？</p>
<p>但現在，好萊塢各影片公司已感到此種政策的非計，因為好萊塢的影片，在中國有着廣大的巿塲。如果把這種影片，運到中國放映，是會引起華人的惡感的。允其在影片中，已往所演出的中國的一切，和事實不符。中國是一個開化最早的古國，她正有着不可磨滅的燦爛的文化。</p>
<p>另方面，中國籍的演員，近年來也已澈底覺悟了，巳往祗知賺到薪金，一切都任製片商或導演的安排，呌他們飾何種角色，就飾何種角色，辱華與吾，壓根兒不知道的，現在，他們已知道飾此種角色，有辱祖國，非但使祖國同胞不滿，更將影響自身的前途。因此，對於這個問題也就注意起來，以後碰到公司方面要他們飾辱華的角色，就會不客氣的表示拒絕。</p>
<p>在這情形之下，好萊塢影片公司，今後非但將避免攝製辱華性質的影片，就是童奴，差役一類角色，也決定不再使中國籍的演員飾演，這樣就能消除影片在中國公映時引起糾紛，或發生誤會。而我們相信，今回中國的抗戰，巳使整個世界改觀，看出中國是前途無限的遠東第一大國，這確也是加速好萊塢改變此種政策的一大原因呢！</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>銀幕笑匠卓別林主演的「獨裁者」，喧傳不止一年。該片的中心意識把歐洲某獨裁者描摹成一個可憐的小兵，不無引起國際麻煩的感覺，製片會數度停頓。每决當卓別林要繼續開拍的時候，就會有秘密團體警告他，以取他生命為威脅，卓氏不得不將內容增刪，另外定名「偉大的獨裁者」，但仍沒有把它完成意思。這决歐戰開始以後，情景當然不同，卓別林也奮發起來，預備加入民主陣綫，替猶太人爭氣。鑒於英法籍電影演員，紛紛歸國從　，他近來關閉在開末拉室中，埋頭拍戲，日夜工作十小時，預備趕緊把它完成，增厚宣傳的力量。卓別林在拍戲的時候，鬥外禁衛森嚴，有武裝者十名護衛，防人闖入搗亂。據聞此片將灌輸政治的意識，不僅一味諷刺而巳。卓別林且向友人聲言：「總而言之，希特勒此人並非笑料。」又有新聞訪員相信卓別林巳抱有絕大的抗戰決心，「獨裁者」，將是他最末一部作品。此後他將仿傚英國以演莎氏樂府著名的劇人吉戈爾一般，加入英國步兵，出發前綫。假使真的話一，那末三十年笑匠的却利卓別一林，至此完全改變作風了。</p>

<p>記得有一天在璇宮看話劇，幕啟，前間住著一個舞女，擺設下許多摩登傢具，那舞女坐在統軟的沙發裹，聽聽無綫電，和客人通通電話，儘量享受着物質文明。後亭子問住着一位鄉下姑娘，破床上躺着個垂死的老婆子，二房東催命似的向她追索</p>
<p>（四九）着欠租。鄕下姑娘不曉得如何是好，突然奔至前間，求舞女給她些援助，替她想條出路，來維持她的生活。舞女却大聲地問道，你是要生呢？還是活呢？若是要生，就該百折不撓地保持着你所抱定的志向，受點窘，挨點餓，又算得了什麽。要活呢，現在你所可出賣的就是你那塊肉。（大意如此，）當時觀客中有幾位舞女，頻頻用手帕去拭着眼睛，想是在掬着同情之淚吧。</p>
<p>「前世作了孽，今世做舞女。」即使月入千餘元的紅星也在這麼說。然而在一班貧家婦女看起來，當舞女的吃的是山珍海味，穿的是呢絨綢緞，還有不少的先生少爺們，向她們追求趨奉，又有那些兒不好呢。唉，打折門牙往肚裏嚥，自苦自得知。目前在百樂門，有兩位紅星向我說，我倒很相信，很同情她們的苦處。一位朋友反對道，「你不是舞女，你怎麽知道舞女的苦處？」我說，「你不是我，你怎麽知道我不知道舞女的苦處，」這原不過是抄抄莊老先生的老文章，可惜那朋友不省得，還要去向那兩位紅　　證呢。</p>
<p>照這麼說，難道做舞女的，就祇可求活、不能求生了麼？不然，不然，有許多高車駟為的顯達者流，他們也何嘗在生着呢，他們也僅僅是奢侈些的活着罷了。西哲有言：「人是為生活着而吃飯，不是為吃飯而要生活着。」所以生活二字，必須速在一起，纔有意義，否則　便成行尸走肉，但這是智識上的問題，不是職業上的問題，任何一業中，卻有賢俊，卻有敗類。孔子曰，「吾十有五，而志於學，三十而立……」舞女們，你們要求生麽？就應該先虛心求學，學些智識，學些為人的道理，等你發現了人生光明的大路時，你一定會有快樂和前進的志趣，再也感不到厭世和苦惱了。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>一齣表揚民族英雄的戲劇</p>
<p>中國戲劇總是以娛樂性質的佔多數，提倡舊道德如忠孝節義等者固亦不少，但是表揚民族英雄而堪稱為國防戲劇的却就微乎其微了。崑曲中有一齣「寗武關」，一名「滿門忠烈」，這齣戲倒的確合乎上述兩個條件。無如劇詞高深，曲高和寡，現在之崑劇巳呈日漸式微，不絕如縷的狀態，反不如歷史較淺的皮黃能普及全國，備受各級民衆的熱烈歡迎。是故空有如此佳劇，復能適合近代之思想潮流，然而淹沒無聞，已漸為世人所遺忘，未免太覺可惜。倘愛好劇曲者不積極加以提倡，吾恐不數年間，將有佳作失傳，曲散廣陵之歎。所以現在特把該劇劇情縷述於后，藉以促起國人之注意，劇作家如能改編為皮黃，使文武兼全之靠把鬚生演之，預料必可激發今日之人心，且獲得觀衆之熱烈贊許。</p>
<p>明代末葉，宦官專政，政治窳敗，崇禎雖非亡國之君，無如朝政已壞到不堪收拾的地步，奸邪蒙蔽君上，重征暴歛，流寇四起，淸兵乘隙於外，闖賊擾亂於內，縱有思宗之賢明，然大勢已去，無可挽回，滿朝文武，只太監王承恩與大將李國貞赤心為國，繼袁崇煥之後，以身殉難。（一三八）</p>

<p>本月十九日晚八時，八仙橋青年會有一個規模盛大的音樂大會，這個音樂大會的參加者包括了全上海的業餘音樂界的一時之秀，音專，及各業餘團體的歌詠班全以他們最優秀的人員來參加。也可以說，這决的「上海業餘音樂界音樂大會」，是全滬的業餘音樂界人材的總動員。</p>
<p>在節目方面，有鋼琴，提琴，吉他等等的獨奏，合奏及獨唱等，最惹人注目的是集各團體精華的一百餘人的大合唱，唱的節目巳決定是黃自的遺作，那個歌則還未決定，大概總不出「旗正飄瓢」「圍獵」那一些。</p>
<p>票價方面，分一元和二元兩種，這因為靑年會的位子本來不多，又得留出一部份給表演者自己用，便不得不然，這一决票子除當日在會塲出售外，於事先也向各界推銷，所以客滿大概不成問題。</p>
<p>上海自從成為「孤島」，小規模的同樂性質的音樂會雖然時常有，但像這樣集全　音樂界的精英，却還是第一决，它象徵了「孤島」業餘音樂界的團結一致，它是建立起從量的擴大到質的提高的起點的。</p>

<p>Changsha: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, deeply moved by the sacrifices and hardships endured by all units participating in the Xiang-Jiang campaign, dispatched special envoys with personal letters to the frontline to express his condolences and convey his deep concern. Upon receiving this news, the troops were filled with immense excitement. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zaoyang: The situation on the Hubei northern front has been relatively calm recently. There has been no contact in the northwest of Suixian, but Chinese forces have deployed a unit in the southeast to attack the Japanese rear between Dushan and Jinghe, achieving considerable success. However, the Japanese army has been continuously increasing troops in Anlu, Suixian, and Yinghan, with heavy Japanese transport activity on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway and the Xichong Road, suggesting a major battle will soon erupt in southern Henan and northern Hubei. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: On the morning of the 5th, over 2,000 Japanese soldiers, with more than 20 artillery pieces, attacked the Chinese troops on the eastern bank of the river. After occupying Weijiaji, they harassed Gaojiapo along the north of the river. The brave Chinese troops intercepted and fought fiercely with the Japanese for half a day, inflicting countless casualties. The battle for Jin'gangkou saw six major engagements before the area was finally recaptured by the Chinese forces. Heavy fighting continued until late evening. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yu Ji: In recent days, there have been frequent skirmishes between Chinese and Japanese forces near Changzi. On the 28th of last month, more than 300 Japanese infantry and cavalry in two groups harassed Shizhezhen and Jiajialing. Chinese troops ambushed them near Zhuangxiang Village, and after two hours of intense fighting, the Japanese soldiers fled to Xiaonan and Dashitou. On the 29th, another group of Japanese soldiers from the city attacked the Beishizhuang (northeast of Shizhe) area, but they were intercepted by Chinese troops, and the remaining Japanese retreated. On the 31st, a few hundred infantry and cavalry attacked Shizhezhen again. Chinese troops launched a night attack west of Shizhe, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese, who broke through and retreated. The Chinese captured military maps and important documents. On the 1st, more than 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry, under the cover of artillery, attacked Shizhezhen in three routes. One of the routes, heading south of Shizhe, was ambushed by Chinese troops. After a fierce engagement, they were defeated by the Chinese forces. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yu Ji: On the night of the 30th of last month, Chinese troops destroyed multiple sections of the Liyang-Luquan section of the Xiyang-Mishun highway, cut down over 100 telephone poles, and captured a Japanese officer alive. On the 31st, they also destroyed three sections of the highway between Yaodi Village and Dingwangzhen, totaling five Chinese miles. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: A certain general, who resolutely led his troops to fight the Japanese in northern Hunan and achieved a great victory, has been admired by the entire nation. A reporter made a special trip to the front line to interview him and was granted an audience. The reporter first paid his respects and praised the general's decisive strategy. The general smiled humbly and replied that the great victory in northern Hunan was due to the virtue and authority of the Commander-in-Chief, the guidance of superiors, the coordination of the right wing, the brave soldiers, and the sincere cooperation and unity of the Hunanese people. He expressed that he was encouraged and comforted by the letters and telegrams of praise from compatriots at home and abroad, and that he would continue his efforts, remain humble and persevere, and strive to recover lost territory, so as not to betray the expectations and enthusiasm of all parties. He will follow up on the success of the campaign. The general shared many insightful experiences from the battlefield, including a pointed observation on the reasons for the Japanese army's failure. When asked about the future situation in northern Hunan, the general did not give a definite answer as to whether the Japanese would make a comeback or disappear without a trace, only saying that everyone was determined to fight the Japanese to the end with all their strength.

<h3 id="e23">Comments on Speculation <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai has long been known domestically as a city of speculative markets. Unbeknownst to many, the speculation usually focuses on the exchanges. However, since the August 13th Incident, the scope has gradually expanded, encompassing foreign exchange, gold, foreign currencies, cotton yarn, flour, and even cloth, rice, and daily necessities. Almost everything has become a target for speculation. With the outbreak of the European War, the interest in speculation has intensified. All foreign goods, whether oxen, horses, or otherwise, are indiscriminately collected and hoarded, creating a period of great prosperity. However, government bonds, once the focus of speculators, now fluctuate with the situation and are no longer the center of speculation. Nevertheless, the desire to escape with capital and the ambition to get rich by luck remain fervent in the hearts of speculators. Since the beginning of this year, foreign stocks have become the sole favorite of speculative elements. New highs are frequently reported, only to quickly become relics of the past. Stocks such as those of the Reemtsma &amp; Ruyong Dockyard, the Yieh Sung Dockyard, the Kailan Mining Administration, the Ewo Cotton Mill, the International Trust, the China Land Reclamation, the China Steel Corporation, and the Shanghai Bank experienced the fastest growth. In the rubber stock sector, stocks like Anglo-Dutch Plantations of Java, Anglo-Java Rubber, and the Shanghai Land Investment Company also saw significant increases. Other stocks have also followed the same trend. This is the recent outline of speculative activities.</p>
<p>The reason why the speculation has been rampant in the past two years is that commodity prices have been rising steadily with no hope of falling. Any undertaking results in profit, which encourages the trend of hoarding for profit. Even those with modest assets try to pool resources to get involved. Those who become wealthy through speculation reinvest their profits, always finding favorable opportunities. They boast of their accurate predictions, hitting the mark repeatedly, making it extremely difficult to persuade them to change course and seek price stabilization.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that there is no hope of curbing speculation because of the unstable situation, which is why speculation is so prevalent. However, there are also reasons why we cannot take such an optimistic view of speculation. The psychology of speculators must be rooted in the belief that "every move will seize the opportunity and prevail in the world." Otherwise, why speculate? Having this confidence, they may not know whether the opportunity they invest in will match their predicted expectations. If it does not, failure and setbacks will follow. If it does, and they make several profits on a single investment, they will be overjoyed and elated. But can they guarantee that they will not go again when they are pleased? And if they go again, can they guarantee that they will still be able to devise extraordinary plans and win? Moreover, those who gain by improper means will lose by improper means. At the beginning of the European War, Shanghai residents scoured for foreign goods, leaving no stone unturned. Prices soared more than once a day, but before long, those who thought they could become as wealthy as during the European War in the early Republic of China were disappointed, even suffering significant losses. This is because imitating the old ways in today's situation is to be oblivious to the times. They do not consider the quantity of goods in the market or the actual state of daily consumption. Blindly following others, they rush to acquire goods, only to realize after the event that while what they hold may not be entirely useless, it is all stagnant stock. This is also a neglect of the situation. Hesitation leads to disaster, which is why speculation often fails. Selling when prices fall and buying when prices rise is what they consider smart market behavior. But they do not realize that the heavier the accumulation, the lighter the boat and the heavier the load. In the face of great winds and waves, can they guarantee that they will not capsize? This is also a failure to guard against the harm of greed. Since it is called an "opportunity," it is fleeting. And since it is called "speculation," how can one be sure of hitting the mark? The difficulty of speculation is extreme. So, are there people who have made a fortune through speculation? There may be a few, but they are extremely rare, flourishing for a time and failing in an instant. This is a common sight in the speculative market. Furthermore, speculators often rely on luck, so they often listen to astrologers and fortune tellers, being fooled and deceived without realizing it. To make investment decisions based on astrology is to misunderstand the nature and function of speculation. And since most speculative elements in Shanghai are like this, it is clear that they do not have true insight.</p>
<p>The reason why we worry about speculators is that today's Shanghai market is controlled by speculators who hoard for profit. So, when they hoard goods and sell them, market prices will be level; but when they gather resources, prices will soar. Market prices are pushed higher and higher, which should secretly delight speculators. But how many of these high-priced hoarded goods are actually traded? In reality, there is mostly a price but no market. Moreover, stocks have a limited quantity. The higher they are pushed, the more likely sellers will be unable to deliver due to excessive short positions, and buyers will be unable to take delivery due to excessive prices. Even if stocks are bought at high prices, receiving a normal rate of return is still not a well-considered plan. The high cost of living in Shanghai has its special reasons, and the fueling of the flames by speculators also contributes to it. They do not realize that the so-called profits of speculators are mostly like flowers in a mirror and the moon's reflection in the water. Even if everything goes according to the speculator's wishes, a few become rich while the masses remain poor. What is the point of being rich then? Therefore, we know that the awakening of speculators cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Britain's Far East Policy Remains Unchanged; Soviet Union Continues to Aid China; Sun Ke Admits Soviet Loans Used to Purchase Military Supplies; Expresses Satisfaction with Meeting with British Foreign Secretary <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>London "Financial Times" reported today that reliable sources revealed that China and the Soviet Union had recently concluded an agreement under which the Soviet Union would lend China 60 million pounds in gold to purchase war materials. The Chinese government agreed to reserve a large portion of its production of tungsten, manganese, and antimony to meet the needs of the Soviet Union. However, according to Sun Ke in London, speaking to a Reuters reporter, this news is not accurate. However, the Soviet Union frequently provides credit and loans to China and exchanges various Chinese products for war materials. He declined to specify the amount. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London – Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, is currently visiting London for a short stay. Today, a Reuters reporter met with him after his meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax. Sun said that the government's policy towards China has not changed and that he is very satisfied. He said that his conversation with the British Foreign Secretary was very encouraging. Sun Ke then expressed his opinion that the Soviet Union's Far East policy would continue as before, saying that the Soviet Union has always assisted China and will continue to do so in the future. He said that he was certain that the Soviet Union had no intention of going to war with Japan, but only wanted to resist Japanese aggression. He added that the Soviet Union's military strength is superior to that of Japan, so resisting Japan is relatively easy, as evidenced by the Battle of Nomonhan. When asked by a Reuters reporter about the possibility of peace in the Far East, Sun Ke replied that if moderate elements in Japan regain power, peace could be discussed on a suitable basis. However, generally speaking, peace in the Far East seems to depend on the outcome of the European war, but this is only his personal opinion. Sun Ke continued that he was certain that Wang Jingwei would not be able to absorb influential Chinese from the political or business circles in Chongqing to help him organize a pro-Japanese government. Sun Ke strongly denied the rumors of Soviet troops invading Xinjiang, saying that he had recently met several Chinese people from Xinjiang and learned that this was not the case, and that it would be very difficult for the Soviet Union to send troops across the water-scarce desert into Xinjiang. Sun Ke later expressed the opinion that the Soviet Union currently does not want to join the European war, but said that the Allied countries should try their best to keep the Soviet Union neutral. He said that the Soviet Union may not be able to supply Germany with large quantities of oil and iron due to its own needs, but it could transport food to Germany. The Allied countries should purchase as much of the Soviet Union's surplus production as possible. Sun Ke did not mention that he arrived in Paris a month ago via Moscow and Warsaw, and is now in London to continue communication.

<p>New York – Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih said in a speech today that despite the European War, Britain and France are still assisting China, and the Soviet Union is actively assisting China with loans and military supplies, entering China through the back door, namely through Myanmar and Vietnam. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>New York – Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, delivered a speech last night at the Biel Hotel to 300 participants in the "Bowl of Rice" movement, which costs US$25 per person, saying, "You can believe me that China will never make peace with Japan unless it can achieve a fair peace." Hu praised the United States' concern for the Far East issue, saying, "The United States' abolition of the Japanese-American commercial treaty can be said to be the United States already using its sharpest weapon. If this weapon is used properly, it can promote peace, implement justice, and prevent the sacrifices of the Chinese people from being in vain." The longer China can hold off Japan, the stronger China's position against Japan will be. "China's future is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people. If we can fight Japan for 28 months, or for another five years, or even longer, our power to negotiate with Japan will become stronger and stronger. Therefore, in the future, Japanese militarists will voluntarily accept a fair peace. Unless this day comes, we will never stop the war." He also said, "This Sino-Japanese War has caused Japan losses eight times greater than those of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 and the Russo-Japanese War. Japan's exchange rate is also several times higher than in 1931. Since the outbreak of the war, Japan has shipped as much as US$511,000,000 in gold to the United States." It is reported that Japan's annual gold production is only US$24,000,000, but its need for gold is as high as US$250,000,000. It is also reported that the "Bowl of Rice" movement in the United States plans to raise US$200,000, and that at least US$10,000 will be raised here tonight. It is said that there are 200 such gatherings across the United States, which can raise US$180,000. (United Press, 10th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – According to Army Minister Hata Shunroku, speaking to Osaka newspaper reporters today, the China-Japan problem is becoming increasingly complex due to changes in the international situation, but Japan should still adhere to its determination to establish a "new order in East Asia." The first step is to establish a "new central government" in China, while replenishing military equipment and preparing to cope with the complex international situation. (United Press, 10th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – When receiving the press this morning, a reporter asked about the visit of Polish Ambassador Rommel to Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki on Wednesday, and whether it was related to Japan's revocation of recognition of Poland. The spokesman replied that the Polish ambassador's meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Tani was to discuss routine matters and had nothing to do with the revocation of recognition. He also said that the Japanese government still recognizes the Polish ambassador stationed in Tokyo. The reporter also asked whether the new Soviet Ambassador Smetanin would visit Foreign Minister Nomura soon, as reported. The spokesman replied that the Soviet ambassador had not made such contact, and as far as he knew, the Soviet ambassador planned to rest a bit after his long journey. The spokesman also said that the Netherlands had requested the United States to take care of its East Indian colonies in the event of an emergency.

<p>Munich – The perpetrators and background of the Munich bombing incident have not yet been identified and are currently under active investigation. Police officers arrested hundreds of people on the night of the 8th. Railway stations, hotels, and roads leading out of the city were given special attention by the police to prevent the escape of the perpetrators. Those arrested were immediately released after proving their innocence. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German Police Chief Himmler is now in Berlin, and Inspector General Wulff of his headquarters has been ordered to be responsible for investigating the Munich bombing case. According to Himmler, based on the clues obtained from the investigation, the masterminds must be abroad. Therefore, the German government has instructed its diplomatic representatives in foreign countries to offer a reward of 300,000 marks for any information leading to the breaking of the case. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin – After the Munich bombing case occurred, Police Chief Himmler appointed a committee of experts to conduct an investigation. As of this time, although it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the background and perpetrators, it has been determined that this conspiracy was not carried out hastily, but was a carefully planned and well-prepared plot. The explosives were equipped with a timing mechanism. The committee members are now thoroughly investigating the truth based on the clues obtained. (Haitong, 10th)</p>

<p>Washington – Regarding the bombing in Munich, Germany, when Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday, a reporter asked whether it was customary for the US government to send a telegram of congratulations when a foreign head of state was attacked but survived. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that a decision could only be made after receiving a report and ascertaining whether a congratulatory gesture was appropriate. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington – Official circles here want to know the details of the case and whether it is as transmitted by telegraph, and not the same trick as the Reichstag fire of the past. They want to know whether the explosion was of a military nature or an accidental event before expressing official opinions. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome – Newspapers throughout Italy expressed indignation at the attempted assassination of Hitler and expressed happiness that Hitler left the scene early. The Italian ambassador to Germany has telegraphed German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to express condolences, and Italian King Victor Emmanuel and Mussolini have also telegraphed Hitler to congratulate him on his escape.

At the same time, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Carol II of Romania telegraphed Hitler to express their congratulations and condolences. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The news issued by foreign news agencies regarding the recent situation of Head of State Hitler is inconsistent and even conflicting. For example, some say that Hitler is hiding in the Thurigian countryside, while others say that Hitler is now receiving guests at the Prime Minister's Office in Berlin. In fact, this afternoon, Hitler had a conversation with the Papal Envoy, who represented the Pope and the diplomatic corps stationed in Germany to congratulate Head of State Hitler. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris – The bombing in Munich, Germany, has been commented on by various morning newspapers here, all saying that this is a trick of the country's political police. Head of State Hitler has thus benefited, and the slander against Britain will not be without effect. On the contrary, it can be used as an excuse to purge dissidents internally and invade Belgium and the Netherlands externally. The Radical Party's "L'Ordre" newspaper reported that "previously, all plots to harm Hitler and Goering were kept secret by the German News Agency, a semi-official organization in the country. Whether the alleged masterminds are real can be imagined. The propaganda campaign conducted by the country's newspapers and radio stations is exactly the same as that conducted after the arson of the German Congress in 1933. The sudden accusation of the British intelligence agency is obviously intended to leave room for action against Belgium and the Netherlands, and to establish naval and air bases in those countries, and to threaten Britain more directly." The right-wing "Le Figaro" newspaper reported that "this case is the prelude to Germany's new aggression, which may be directed against the Netherlands. At that time, Nazi Party members will offer explanations, saying that this is due to British provocation and there is no choice but to do so. At the same time, the moderates of the Nazi Party will be eliminated under the pretext of eliminating enemy staff. In short, if this case is a genuine murder case, it must have been committed by Nazi Party members who opposed Hitler. In any case, this is another clear proof of the unrest in the hearts of the German people." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Amsterdam – A shooting occurred yesterday in Venlo, a town on the border between the Netherlands and Germany. The details are very mysterious. Responsible officials here are unwilling to make any statement before clarifying the truth. All that is known is that a German car stopped abruptly in front of the Dutch customs, allowing customs officials to inspect it. At the same time, a Dutch car was driving towards Germany and stopped in front of the customs, waiting for inspection. Unexpectedly, the German car suddenly crossed the border into the Netherlands and stopped near this car. Several German armed customs officials also followed. Soon, several gunshots were heard, and a passenger in the Dutch car was immediately shot and injured. The German customs officials then dragged him into their country and ordered his companions to follow. The Dutch customs officials were unable to intervene in such a sudden incident. The identity of the person abducted has not yet been identified.

The Merwede Canal in Amsterdam was closed yesterday afternoon. At the same time, busy military transport has greatly restricted various passenger transport services.

According to well-informed sources, both sides have made concessions and a solution can be reached soon. The most important of the demands put forward by the Soviet Union are two: one is to establish a naval base at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, and the other is to revise the border near Leningrad, moving the Finnish border ten kilometers westward, and then designating the border area as a demilitarized zone. It is reported that Finland has agreed to cede the three islands of Seiskari, Lavansaari, and Tytärsaari (all at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland) to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union will cede territory in the Galeria area as a condition of exchange. On the Soviet side, it no longer insists on signing a mutual assistance treaty with Finland, as it has established with Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, but only to strengthen the existing non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland, and require that Finland cannot participate in any treaty or group that is directly or indirectly detrimental to the Soviet Union.

<p>London - Today, the High Court continued to hear Princess Hohenlohe's case against Lord Rothermere, owner of the "Daily Mail," for breach of contract and seeking compensation. Copies of several of the most confidential letters between Rothermere and continental dignitaries were presented to the court as evidence. The princess testified that she had repeatedly met with Hitler on the orders of the Lord. The court asked about a letter from Hitler to Rothermere, the opening line of which was "Thank you for your kindness in forwarding some suggestions to me." The princess replied that she conveyed this suggestion to Hitler on behalf of the Lord. She was often ordered to transfer various gifts, such as gold watches, cigarette cases, and embroideries, to the German head of state. The princess also said that the Lord was rich and generous, and what she is asking for now is only to repay her expenses. When the British King held the coronation ceremony, she followed the Lord's instructions and tried her best to recruit German representatives. At least five German representatives resided in her residence, and she often held banquets and concerts to entertain them. Since the newspaper published the news that she was engaged in espionage work, she was abandoned in social gatherings. The princess claimed during cross-examination that a bundle of documents she presented to the court contained many confidential letters between the Lord and European dignitaries, all of which were photographed and preserved with the Lord's permission. The lawyer asked about a copy of a letter from the German Crown Prince to the Lord. The princess replied that this copy was obtained with the consent of the German Crown Prince from the Crown Prince's correspondence manager. The German Crown Prince later said that he deeply regretted writing this letter. The princess later said that Weidemann, the former adjutant to Hitler, was her close friend. She met him in Paris the day before Weidemann went to San Francisco to take office. She also said that she obtained a copy of a letter from Lord Rothermere to Hitler from the German Chancellery. At this point in the trial, the court announced a recess. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>London - The Lord Mayor's Show is the most joyous festival for the people of London. The decorations and celebrations have always been very lively, but the situation is different today. This is unprecedented in 109 years. When the new Lord Mayor, Sir William Coxen, was sworn in at the court, only a dozen or so prominent London figures went to observe the ceremony in cars. All officials carried gas masks, and their cars were guarded by soldiers on motorbikes. In previous years, the banquet at the Guildhall was extremely lively, but now, due to the blackout, it was changed to a smaller banquet held during the day and did not invite female guests. Many cabinet members attended the banquet, and commissioners from the autonomous regions and India stationed in London were guests of honor. During the banquet, Chancellor Simon read Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, and the retiring mayor also announced that the Red Cross funds had reached £700,000. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e46">West Ukrainian Representatives Declare to Refute Rumors <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - Representatives of the West Ukrainian National Assembly, Professor Studynsky of Lviv, Pankiv of Rohatyn, Stanisławów Province, Gogol of Brody, Tarnopol Province, Olesiuk, and Ms. Sikharubina of Bobryk Village, Stanisławów Province, recently published a declaration in Soviet newspapers, saying,</p>
<p>"The British Reuters news agency disseminated a 'correct' message from the 'Polish-Romanian border' on November 7 regarding the results of the West Ukrainian National Assembly representative elections. It is claimed that only 25% of rural voters and 50% of urban voters participated in the National Assembly elections. This news is purely fabricated. The West Ukrainian people did indeed show unprecedented unity, activity, and organizational strength in the National Assembly elections on October 22. The elections were held in accordance with absolutely democratic election laws. Among the 4,766,175 voters, 4,433,997 voted, accounting for 92.83% of the total. All these facts are well-known to the world and leave no room for dispute. Reuters's wild barking of rumors is incomprehensible. Moreover, it is claimed that the message was sent from the 'Polish-Romanian border,' and we dare to tell the lords of Poland in London that the so-called 'Polish border' has long passed and there is absolutely no possibility of it coming again. All that exists now is the Soviet-Romanian border. It is unnecessary for us to refute why those in London who are accustomed to using others to pick up tickets in the fire instructed Reuters to spread such rumors. What we should point out is that the reason these gentlemen spread rumors is because the change in the situation has made them feel uneasy in their dreams. They are accustomed to sitting back and reaping huge profits from the Drohobych oil fields and the banks of West Ukraine, which have now become things that they will never see again. Due to the resolution of the West Ukrainian National Assembly, these oil fields, banks, and large industries have all been nationalized. The treasures that British and French imperialists entrusted to certain lackeys, the Polish lords, 20 years ago, ordering them to extract and plunder them on their behalf, have now become the public property of the Ukrainian nation. The British and French imperialists can no longer control the fate of the West Ukrainian people. 92.83% of the voters have unanimously resolved not to freely hand over their freedom to foreigners again. Isn't this making those gentlemen feel distressed and pained? However, all the people of West Ukraine will definitely do their best to defend this regained freedom. The great Soviet Union and the invincible Workers' and Peasants' Red Army will forever be the guarantee of this freedom. The West Ukrainian working masses will sweep away all the tricks of provocation and alienation under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and strive to build a new, free, and bright life, and will forever be members of the Soviet multi-ethnic family."

<h3 id="e48">Chinese Troops Control the Suburbs of Jiangmen and Xinhui; Japanese Troops' Attempt to Invade Samshui Fails; Japanese Troops in Shunde Are Transferred to Support Jiangmen and Xinhui; Zhongshan Suffers Extremely Severe Disasters Due to Devastation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Xinzeng and Jiangmen in Guangdong Province have recently threatened to invade Samshui, the commercial center of the central district, and have advanced along the Xin Kai road line. On the 27th, 28th, and 30th of last month, Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed Samshui, and the ferries of Xinhui, Kaiping, Taishan, and Enping were also attacked by Japanese aircraft, intending to assist the Japanese troops in advancing rapidly. However, by the 31st, large numbers of Chinese troops had successively reinforced along the Xin Kai road line and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese troops in the vicinity of Da Xiao Mei and Lian Tang. The Japanese troops were defeated, leaving dozens of corpses, and retreated in a mess back to Xinhui. The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory and pursued, and have recovered Da Xiao Mei. The Japanese troops defended stubbornly, firing cannons at the Shatidi Bridge and Jinniu Mountain west of the city. There was also contact between the two armies near the Fenjiang River, but the fighting was not as intense as before. There were no major battles on the Xinhe, Jiangfo, and Jiangzhuo roads. The Japanese troops stubbornly defended Jiangmen, and its suburbs have been controlled by Chinese troops. The situation in Samshui has also eased. Many of the ferries in Siyi have also resumed service, but after passing Sanjiang, they still need to be transferred by long boats. However, the Japanese troops' ambition to invade has not been curbed. It is recently heard that the Japanese troops in Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, and other places in Shunde have also been transferred to reinforce Jiangmen and Xinhui, but the number of people is unknown. At present, the majority of the Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui are concentrated in the vicinity of Xin Kai Road and Licun area of Jiang Fo Road near Xinhui. The Second Detachment of the First Guerrilla Area recently attacked Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, and other places in Shunde and was very successful. The former Xinshun Special Detachment of the Fifth Guerrilla Area, the Zhou Hanling Department, also carried out night attacks on Japanese troops on the river surface at the intersection of Xinshun. At that time, a Japanese ship traveling to Guangzhou and Jiangmen passed by and was intercepted by the unit, fighting each other for several hours, killing many Japanese and puppet troops.</p>
<p>The Japanese navy previously invaded Zhongshan, Hengmen, Dieshi, Jinzhong, and other places and was severely attacked by the Chinese local troops, suffering heavy casualties. The army also suffered considerable losses. According to a military intelligence report yesterday, the bodies of the Japanese navy officers and soldiers killed in action have been completely transported back to Guangzhou for cremation. Peng Dongyuan, chairman of the puppet Guangdong Security Committee, actually led a group of people to hold a memorial service for the Japanese navy officers and soldiers killed in action in the large open space in front of the Japanese naval headquarters on the 29th of last month. Japanese military officers also attended the ceremony. As for Zhongshan County, which has been repeatedly devastated by Japanese troops, the damage is enormous. The first, second, and fourth districts have become fields of rubble and scorched earth, with desolate scenes. At present, disaster victims are everywhere, suffering from hunger and cold. In addition, they have lost their homes and are living in the open, or they are suffering from serious illnesses and moaning. They lament the lack of livelihood and feel that it is difficult to prolong their lingering lives. They are displaced and cannot be described. According to statistics, more than 500 people were killed by Japanese troops or died of fright. More than 2,300 houses were destroyed, and more than 2,700 households were robbed. The people's property losses totaled more than 2,917,170 yuan. More than 1,650 women were insulted. The suffering of the disaster is truly unbearable to speak of. In Bao'an County, Japanese troops have been strengthening the defensive works in Nantou, Shenzhen, and other places for days to prevent Chinese troops from counterattacking. They have also laid landmines on the Baoshen, Yankou, and Shashen roads. In addition, the airfield that the Japanese troops previously built in the wasteland behind the Tianmian Village on the Baoshen Road has now been suspended because it is not suitable for military use. At 6:00 am one day, the Japanese artillery team in Shenzhen Datouling fired two or thirty shells in succession. The Japanese troops in Shenzhen were preparing one after another. Later, it was learned that the Japanese artillery in Datouling had mistakenly thought that the Chinese troops were attacking and fired cannons to prevent it. At present, the Japanese troops in Bao'an all stay in defensive works and trenches at night, and only come out to act during the day. Every morning, they must fire cannons into the air. The Chinese troops are well aware that the morale of the Japanese troops is depressed and have sent teams to completely encircle the periphery of the Japanese troops in Bao'an, cutting off the Japanese troops' transportation lines and waiting for an opportunity to attack.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Rampant Pirate Activity in Fujian Province's Wu Islet, Coordinating with Japanese Forces; Military Authorities Maintain Strict Defense <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the start of the War of Resistance, several coastal islands in Fujian Province have fallen. In the southern Fujian region, these include Jinmen (Quemoy), Xiamen (Amoy), and Meizhou islands. In the Fujian-Guangdong region, there are Pingtan, Chuanshi, Dongsha, and Nangan islands. Of these, Jinmen, Xiamen, and Chuanshi islands are garrisoned by Japanese troops. Pingtan, Meizhou, Dongsha, and Nangan islands are occupied by pirates under Japanese command. Puppet organizations have been established on Jinmen, Xiamen, and Pingtan islands, with Chinese traitors serving as puppet county magistrates and puppet mayors. The pirates call themselves the "Fujian People's Army" and specialize in raiding the coastal areas and waters of Fuqing, Lianjiang, Changle, Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an counties, seizing young men, women, grain, money, which they exchange with the Japanese army for weapons. At the same time, the Japanese army also lays mines at various harbors to prohibit ships from entering and exiting, in order to blockade the province's economy. However, because the Chinese defenses are very strict, the Japanese army and pirates, despite repeated attempts to launch joint incursions, have been unable to advance onto the mainland. Since mid-August, the Japanese side has mobilized naval and air forces to launch large-scale attacks on Dongshan Island in southern Fujian. More than ten attacks have been repelled by the defending troops, inflicting heavy casualties. These casualties are being continuously transported back to Taiwan from Xiamen for burial and treatment. The offensive has stalled. The number of Japanese warships along the coast has also greatly decreased compared to May and June. The two important ports of Fuzhou and Quanzhou are usually without any Japanese warship sightings. If one or two ships arrive, they leave after only a few hours. Only the waters off Xiamen often have twelve or thirteen Japanese warships anchored. Therefore, foreign ships from Shanghai and Hong Kong can occasionally enter, and the prices of cloth, medicine, cotton yarn, and oil have gradually fallen. However, Japanese goods are often mixed in. Recently, in the Hanjiang area, a batch of Japanese goods worth more than one million yuan was seized. The pirates occupying Meizhou Island have been repeatedly repelled by the Chinese army but seize opportunities to invade again. Currently, a portion of the island is still occupied by pirates, who use it as a base to harass the coasts of Putian, Xianyou, Fuqing, and Hui'an counties. Therefore, the military authorities have ordered a blockade of the coasts of the above four counties, strictly prohibiting ships from traveling to and from Meizhou, under the penalty of being treated as collaborators. Foreign ships are also prohibited from entering and exiting the Xiuyu port of Hui'an and the Haikou port of Fuqing. On the other hand, the coastal district governments of Fuqing, Putian, Xianyou, and Hui'an are ordered to strictly inspect household registrations. The district governments, together with the garrison troops, are responsible for ensuring that each Lianbao (collective security unit) conducts an inspection every week, and, according to the Baojia system, the residence and movement of people should be accurately registered to prevent bandits and traitors from hiding among them.</p>

<p>Guangdong Front: In Sanshui, Xijiang, on the mornings of the 3rd and 4th, the Japanese forces advanced towards Yangmei through Xinan town. The Chinese forces used mobile tactics to surround and severely attack the Japanese troops. By noon, the Japanese forces broke through and retreated to Sanshui. The Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to pursue them, inflicting many casualties. On the 6th, our air force attacked Guangzhou and encountered Japanese aircraft while passing through Sanshui, resulting in a fierce air battle. Three Japanese aircraft were shot down, and another three were heavily damaged and fled. As for the Japanese forces in Jiangmen and Xinhui, on the morning of the 4th, they launched an attack on Duruan under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese forces calmly responded and fought for half a day before the Japanese forces retreated along their original route, leaving countless corpses behind. In the Chao'an area of the East River, on the dawn of the 5th, the Japanese forces, under the cover of artillery fire, launched attacks on Yixi from both Zhuxiang and Shibei. The Chinese army fiercely resisted, and the battle lasted until 4 PM. Yixi was briefly lost but was subsequently recaptured through counterattacks from multiple routes, engaging in hand-to-hand combat until 8 PM. Zhuxiang and Shibei were also captured. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. On the Southern front, the Japanese forces trapped on Qionghai (Hainan) Island and in Wenchang have been under constant attack by the Chinese forces in recent days, resulting in numerous Japanese deaths. The remaining Japanese forces in the city are now retreating to Haikou. The Japanese forces at the two strongholds of Donggu Tan and Niujiao Tang in the county are also tightly surrounded by the Chinese forces and are attempting to escape.</p>
<p>Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Fronts: In Jiangnan, after the county seat of Yixing was recaptured by the Chinese forces on the 21st of last month, the remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Heqiao and Caoqiao. This week, two thousand reinforcements were sent from the Shanghai-Hangzhou area to launch a large-scale counterattack and launched multiple attacks, resulting in fierce battles. Heqiao has now also been captured by the Chinese forces, who are advancing towards Liyang, where fierce battles are taking place. The Japanese forces trapped near Zha Port in Pudong were besieged by the Chinese army on the 4th, resulting in the killing of hundreds of soldiers. The remaining Japanese forces are wavering. In Wukang and Yuhang in western Zhejiang, more than 1,800 Japanese troops have been fiercely attacking Changsu and Yangjiatou for days, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army. The Japanese have not succeeded so far. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese forces in Zhapu, recapturing the area and surrounding Pinghu, advancing towards Jiaxing and Xie Shi, and completely controlling the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway. In Guichi in southern Anhui, the Japanese forces launched a fierce attack towards Beishan in the east. On the morning of the 2nd, the area was briefly lost but was recaptured by a sudden counterattack by the Chinese forces at noon, forcing the Japanese to retreat. Continuous mopping-up operations have completely recovered all the strongholds near Guichi, including Sihailing, Pingdingshan, and Lanshan, and are now advancing towards Yin Jia Hui. Shuang Gou He and Liu Ji in northern Anhui were also captured by the Chinese forces on the evening of the 1st, forcing the remaining Japanese forces to retreat towards Huaiyuan.</p>
<p>In addition, Ke'anbei in western Suiyuan and Elu Humm and Chou Sih Hao were captured, as well as Ma Mier and Nan Bao Guan Jing near Baotou. In southern Hebei, Heng Ru Zan Huang besieged Ji County. In northern Shandong, Li Jin was captured, Heng Tai was besieged, and Xia Jin was pressured, resulting in the death of many Japanese officers, including Senior Officer Nakamura. In northern Hunan, Xinkai Tang near Yueyang was briefly captured, and the Japanese transportation between Linxiang and Yueyang was cut off. There were also attacks on the county seats of Jing'an, Xin Jian, and Wu Ning, resulting in numerous casualties. On the 4th, Japanese aircraft in the skies near Chengdu were severely attacked by our heroic air force, and Commander Okuda of the Japanese Naval Air Force was killed. These are all important achievements of the past week and are reported here as an addendum. (9th dispatch)</p>

<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: Chen Zubei, a native of Jiangyin, residing in Qiaoqi Town, served as the chairman of the puppet self-government association when Jiangyin fell. Through his extortionist methods, he accumulated considerable wealth and also ran a hotel in Wuxi. Chen's greed was insatiable, and he also served as the puppet director of the Opium Prohibition Bureau and the puppet director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, using the alias Chen Yi. Recently, he also joined the staff of the puppet Land Tax Collection Office, assisting the Japanese and puppet authorities in planning the collection of land taxes. He even volunteered to entice the guerrillas Tao Heshang and Lu Erkang and others in the Sanguan and Shuangpai villages east of the city to not obstruct the tax collection. However, Lu and others refused, and Chen was arrested by soldiers of the Xu unit and handed over to County Magistrate Zhang Pinquan for interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>Li Hanliang, the puppet police chief of Zhangpu Township in Kunshan, had previously served as a staff member in the second section of the county government. Since assuming his puppet position, he had acted arbitrarily, levying exorbitant taxes and levies, causing the villagers to hate him to the bone. Last month, a large detachment of guerrillas suddenly arrived in the town, capturing Li and his follower, Cheng, and taking them to the nearby countryside, where Cheng was immediately executed, greatly pleasing the people. Li's whereabouts have been unknown for a month. It is said that the puppet county government has appointed Pan Chen to replace him.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Since the spring of this year, taking advantage of the rise in the value of copper coins and copper fractional currency, the puppet government has absorbed copper coins from various occupied counties, resulting in a shortage of auxiliary currency for circulation. The puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government, feeling the lack of funds, took the opportunity to conduct extortion. At the beginning of last month, it joined the puppet governments of Zhejiang and Anhui to issue puppet copper coin notes, approved by the puppet Ministry of Finance. It is said that they will be issued soon. Before the issuance, shops in each county are forced to recall and destroy the vouchers issued, and then each county and industry must prepare funds to receive the puppet copper coin notes for general use. It is said that the county chamber of commerce here has received the puppet order, and the number of notes to be received is estimated to be around 50,000 yuan. Other counties will be subject to forced distribution based on their commercial situation.</p>

<p>Most job seekers are young, which is very clear from Table 2. Combining men and women, 81% are aged between 15 and 30. Separately, the largest group is between 21 and 25, which is roughly similar to the situation a year after the war. However, among women, the age of job seekers is gradually increasing to over 20, indicating an increasing trend of married women pursuing careers. There is also an increasing trend of young people aged 15 to 20, who, due to economic difficulties, are forced to leave school and struggle in society during their educational years. There are still quite a few adults seeking employment, an increase of 1% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Age Classification of Job Seekers (Table 2) The educational level of job seekers is concentrated among young people who have graduated from or attended secondary schools, accounting for 51.7% of the total. The next largest group is job seekers with vocational school or primary school education, accounting for 23.8%. The smallest group is job seekers with higher education, accounting for 14.9%. Compared with the previous year, there is an increasing trend in job seekers with primary school education, while there has been a significant decrease in those with university education. The reason is that there is an urgent need for talents with university and specialized education in the inland areas, and there has been a significant increase in those serving in the rear. Very few illiterate job seekers register at the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, so this statistic can only represent the general situation of educated job seekers.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Attempts to Obstruct the Import of Legal Tender Fail: False Supervisor's Conspiracy Foiled, Claiming the Intention Was to Manage, Not Prohibit; Foreign Exchange Rates Ease and Legal Tender Value Rises for Several Days <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>After Li Jiannan, the "Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs," attempted to obstruct the import of Chinese legal tender, consuls from various countries and foreign banks firmly opposed it and ignored him. The supervisor then proposed to manage the transportation of legal tender, claiming it was due to legitimate needs, stating that importing legal tender should require his prior permission. However, foreign banks also decided to ignore this so-called "management." As for Luo, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, he never issued an order to prohibit or manage it. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that "the supervisor's" attempt to obstruct the import of legal tender was aimed at promoting his "Huaxing Notes." The so-called management was also a method of obstruction because the "Huaxing Notes" claimed to be pegged to the British pound at a rate of sixpence. Therefore, the exchange rate announced daily by one of the tax collection offices of the Jianghai Customs showed the "Huaxing Notes" to be higher than the legal tender. Now, because the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has eased, the British pound is close to sixpence, and the price of legal tender will be higher than the "Huaxing Notes," causing a great blow to the "Huaxing Notes." Therefore, he attempted to obstruct legal tender to promote fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market and used the prevention of legal tender inflation as a pretext. In reality, the issuance of Chinese legal tender has always been cautious, and cash reserves remain sufficient. The government has never resorted to paper money policies, and there is no inflation.</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 9th), it was heard from responsible sources that Li Jiannan, the customs supervisor recently appointed by the "new government," sent a letter to the consuls of the Shanghai Consular Body, which did not mention "prohibiting" the import and export of banknotes from Chinese banks but aimed at "controlling the monetary actions of banks." The Consular Body has not yet responded to Li's letter.</p>
<p>Not Obstructing the Import of Legal Tender</p>
<p>Li Jiannan recently told reporters that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the news of his letter to the consuls, which he deeply regretted. His purpose was not to prohibit the import and export of legal tender but only to control the banks and allow them the monetary actions of foreign banks transporting large amounts of legal tender to Shanghai. Banks engaged in transporting currency to Shanghai could achieve their goals if they first applied to him for "permission."</p>
<p>So-called Appropriate Utilization</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the imported legal tender is put to appropriate use, permission will be granted. This matter is mostly related to foreign banks because Chinese banks have not transported amounts of legal tender to Shanghai large enough to attract his attention. The original intent of this order was to seek the "welfare of the Shanghai market and trade," as too many banknotes would cause "inflation," he said. When asked by reporters if there were any difficulties in implementing control, Li replied that this was another question.</p>
<p>The Rumor of Control is Also Inaccurate</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that Li Jiannan firmly denied yesterday that the "Reformed Government" had prohibited the import and export of legal tender in Shanghai, and said that the rumor that the customs authorities are now taking a method of controlling currency is not accurate. The regulations issued do not prohibit the import and export of legal tender but broadly state that the actions of currency must be controlled. Therefore, what is now being taken is a method of control, not prohibition.</p>
<p>The Puppet Regime's Purpose is to Apply First</p>
<p>Last year, there were various unrestricted actions of importing and exporting silver. Now, large amounts of banknotes are being transferred, mostly transported in and out of Hong Kong. In his letter to the consular leader, he outlined the regulations that must be followed and explained that the secret transportation of legal tender is not allowed. Whether Chinese or foreign banks wish to import or export legal tender for commercial purposes, they must first apply for permission from the "Customs Supervisor." The banks must prove that this legal tender is for their own business operations. If the "Customs" considers that the regulations have been followed and that the funds are not used for market speculation, permission will be granted.</p>
<p>Chase Bank's Banknotes Were Never Detained</p>
<p>The letter to the consuls was written in Chinese and dated October 4th, urging the banks to comply with the regulations for the benefit of themselves and the Shanghai market and trade. In response to the matter of the President Pierce's ship carrying approximately 10 million yuan of banknotes last week being briefly detained, Li said that Chase Bank had applied for permission to import these banknotes when they were first transported. The customs opened the boxes for inspection when the legal tender arrived at the customs dock and eventually passed them through.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Parallel Talks in Tokyo and Shanghai: Japan Says Its Wishes Are Difficult to Fulfill Because All Countries Reject the "New Order in East Asia"; The Powers Will Never Risk Committing a Great Wrong <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Japanese diplomat Koki Hirota arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 8th, intending to hold talks parallel to those in Tokyo with the American Consul General in Shanghai, Clarence Gauss, and diplomatic representatives of third countries, and will travel to Nanjing, Hankou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places. According to diplomatic sources, such talks may not be held in the short term because since the</p>
<p>German-Soviet Pact</p>
<p>was signed, Japanese diplomacy has become isolated. Japan is constantly thinking of holding talks with the major powers such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to improve relations with various countries, but the "New Order in East Asia" it has advocated has been rejected by various countries. Therefore, although there has been contact with Britain and the United States, it has</p>
<p>Failed to Convene</p>
<p>a formal meeting. Currently, although Britain has a tendency to compromise with Japan, the United States, a supporter of Britain, has repeatedly stated that it must maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and uphold China's sovereignty, independence, integrity, and the principles of equal opportunity and the open door policy, and will not allow Japan to</p>
<p>Wantonly Destroy Them</p>
<p>If the Japanese side attempts to implement small favors to induce Britain and the United States to recognize the puppet "central regime," and the United States has already opposed it, then Britain is unlikely to risk committing this great wrong and recognize it later. Therefore, how Hirota can convene talks parallel to those in Tokyo in Shanghai is not only hesitant but also difficult to fulfill his wishes. As for the Shanghai conference not being able to be convened immediately, Hirota had already explained it to reporters from Japanese newspapers the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Today is Armistice Day in Europe: Polish People Celebrate National Day; Polish People Hold a Determined Resolve to Restore Their Country Without the Slightest Weakening; Commemoration of the European Armistice is Simpler Than in Previous Years <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Polish People All Over the World Celebrate National Day</p>
<p>November 11th is Armistice Day of the World War, which is also Poland's National Day. After being ruled by foreign countries for 150 years, Poland regained its independence on November 11, 1918. Polish people all over the world will celebrate National Day tomorrow (the 11th). According to news from the Polish Consulate, the</p>
<p>Polish Embassy</p>
<p>will hold a reception tomorrow from 11:30 to 12:30, and has invited Polish expatriates and diplomatic personnel from various countries to attend. In addition, there are various other activities. Historically, Poland occupied an important position in Eastern European politics for 800 years from 902 to 1795. It was then subjected to</p>
<p>Three Partitions</p>
<p>by powerful neighbors in 1772, etc. During the World War from 1914 to 1918, after Germany and Austria suffered defeats, Poland declared its independence on November 11, 1919. On this day, the late General Pilsudski formally notified various countries of the existence of the Polish nation. In the subsequent 21 years, Poland made progress in all aspects and was</p>
<p>Recognized by Various Countries</p>
<p>In September of this year, Germany invaded Poland and occupied its territory. Poland has to fight again to resist aggression. Now that the Allied countries are assisting in the military to restore the Polish nation, Poland can be expected to rise again and be even stronger.</p>
<p>The Situation of the European Armistice Commemoration is Bleak</p>
<p>Today is the "Armistice and Peace Memorial" day of the First World War. The British expatriates in Shanghai, in order to commemorate the souls of the martyrs who died on the battlefield, will still hold a memorial ceremony as usual this year, but it is only slightly simpler due to the extraordinary times. At 8:30 this morning, Mr. Atkins, Chairman of the British Victory League, will lead the presentation of a wreath made of poppy flowers to the</p>
<p>Goddess of Peace</p>
<p>on the Bund. Members of the association or British expatriates who wish to participate can wait in front of the Goddess of Peace before 8:20 this morning, wearing medals or awards, to hold the ceremony. This year is also quite simple. At 10:45 a.m., a meeting will be held at the British Church at 219 Jiujiang Road, and Reverend Chadwick will</p>
<p>Preside Over the Ceremony</p>
<p>At 11:00 a.m., everyone will stand in silence for three minutes to mourn the war dead, and then two songs will be played, followed by the wind music of the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. The association welcomes British expatriates who wish to participate, but seats will not be reserved. Those who participate in the ceremony must donate a small amount of money to supplement the insufficient funds of the British Victory League.</p>
<p>British Veterans</p>
<p>usually hold a luncheon, but this year it has been decided to cancel it. In previous years today, there were public sales of poppy flowers on the streets and alleys to show peace, but this year it has also been decided to stop selling them. However, if foreign expatriates need this flower for personal use or to give to friends, they can request it from the association for free. The association also provides wreaths decorated on cars and tables, but when requesting them,</p>
<p>Contribute a Small Amount of Money</p>
<p>to help the families of those who sacrificed in the last war living in Shanghai. It is heard that these poppy wreaths are ordered from London flower gardens, and their value is very high due to exchange rates. However, British expatriates in Shanghai will enthusiastically donate because the donations are used for charitable expenses. The British Victory League authorities notified all British expatriates in Shanghai to wear fresh flowers all day to the greatest extent possible to</p>
<p>Commemorate the Glorious War Dead</p>
<p>The soldiers of the 4th Regiment of the US Marine Corps, the commanders of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, and Mrs. Whipple, Chairman of the American Women's Association, are all scheduled to lay flowers in front of the Martyrs' Memorial at 11:00 a.m. today to hold a memorial ceremony.</p>

<p>The Japanese army's positions stationed in the suburbs of Shanghai have recently withdrawn in many places. In addition to several withdrawals in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, they also withdrew from many positions in Zhabei yesterday. It is reported that there were two Japanese soldiers stationed at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Boundary Road, but one of them was withdrawn yesterday. There were also two Japanese sentries in the weeds west of the barbed wire on North Tibet Road, but now there is only one left. There was a Japanese soldier stationed on the abandoned fortress diagonally opposite the fire station on Wuzhen Road and Xinmin Road, but he was also gone yesterday. The Northern District of Suzhou Creek used to be patrolled by armed Japanese soldiers from time to time, and barbed wire was repaired, but it has not been seen for many days. Near the North Station, Japanese soldiers used to stroll on the road from time to time, but now they are no longer seen.</p>

<p>After the Central Bank issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, the first batch has been completely issued. The second batch of 500,000 yuan (including 200,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 300,000 yuan in five-cent notes) was entrusted to the American company, Wing On Company, to print. It has completed the printing in batches and delivered it to the Central Bank in accordance with the contract. The bank has scheduled to continue issuing it starting next week. However, the issuance method is to entrust it to the trade associations of various industries for distribution. The general regulation is that each member firm of the association can exchange 20 yuan of fractional currency notes, with the aim of widespread circulation and preventing large amounts from flowing into the occupied areas. It is heard that the Shanghai trade associations have been registering the number of requests from members with the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, amounting to no less than one hundred. The number applied for ranges from tens of thousands of yuan for the largest to thousands of yuan for the smallest. After receiving the letters, the Central Bank, because the 500,000 yuan of the second printing is really insufficient to meet the demand, yesterday specially replied to the trade associations, reducing the number of fractional currency notes registered for collection. The original letter said: "Respectfully, we have received your letter and learned that fractional currency notes are used for making change, and all industries feel the need. If all are exchanged in large quantities, our office will find it difficult to distribute. Regarding the request of your association's members to exchange fractional notes, we will consider allocating them at the appropriate time." After receiving the replies, the trade associations have also sent letters to their respective members, stating that they should not go to the trade association to apply before the Central Bank officially announces the date for collecting fractional currency notes, to avoid repeated trips.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Puppet Police Bureau in West Shanghai Obstructs Concession Police Affairs, Using Non-Cooperation as a Passive Means, Refusing Assistance in Police Searches <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that crimes and illegal activities have been recurring from Yangshupu to Jessfield Road in Shanghai. The Public Concession and French Concession police departments are facing extreme difficulties in detecting criminals. It is allowed that the extra-territorial area of ​​West Shanghai, outside the Public Concession authorities, has become the place of occurrence of major crimes, and a place where some of the most vicious gangs hide and hoard weapons.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Arresting and Searching for Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday (9th), the reporter learned that the "Special Municipal Government" has given very little or no cooperation to the Public Concession Police Department in pursuing gangs or criminals hiding in the extra-territorial road areas. Therefore, although the police department knows the location of the wanted criminals, it often cannot arrest them or recover the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Robbery of a Money Shop on Seward Road</p>
<p>On the evening of October 16, eleven Chinese, half of whom were carrying handguns, robbed the Juru Money Shop at 84 Seward Road within the Japanese military defense zone of 135,000 yuan. The Public Concession Police Department soon arrested several suspects in the Wayside district, some of whom admitted to participating in the robbery. The police department also recovered a portion of the robbed funds in the Zhabei district. After questioning by detectives, some criminals confessed that there was another 8,000 yuan of the robbed funds hidden in several houses in the Jessfield district.</p>
<p>Failure to Cooperate in Going to Search</p>
<p>It is heard that in order to confirm the criminals' confession, the police department has requested the assistance of the Japanese authorities in searching the hiding place of the funds. The Japanese military has handed this matter over to the "Special Municipal Government" police bureau for handling, but the police bureau has not provided the necessary assistance. According to several members of the police department, the police department assists other police organizations, including the "Special Municipal Government" police bureau, without hesitation. However, the "police bureau" rarely or does not cooperate with the police department, so that criminals hiding in or coming from the bad land of the Western District can be brought to justice.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" quoted a Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency on the 10th, saying that Japanese modern writer Sergeant Major Katsunori Tamai, pen name Heihei Hino, served in the Japanese Army and recently completed his term. He returned to Japan on Tuesday and wrote an article published in the Asahi Shimbun-related newspapers today.</p>
<p>Warning Japan</p>
<p>Do not think that the war in China is almost won. Although the Japanese army has occupied cities such as Guangzhou, Japan's mission in China is not over. The actual situation in and around Guangzhou is very</p>
<p>Different From What Is Believed</p>
<p>in Japan. Japanese soldiers are still experiencing many difficulties. The Japanese people think that the war is over and the Japanese soldiers are enjoying themselves, but in fact, the Japanese soldiers are still very active. Even at present, the enemy is still moving around Guangzhou. They are not small guerrilla units but tens of thousands of</p>
<p>Regular Troops</p>
<p>holding strong trenches. They are constantly paying attention to the opportunity to recover Guangzhou. Japanese outposts are attacked by them almost every day. They take advantage of their familiarity with the terrain and take the offensive at night. When attacked, they disperse like flies, but quickly return and fight again. The number of</p>
<p>Japanese Casualties</p>
<p>during the landing at Daya Bay and the conquest of Guangzhou was far less than the number of Japanese soldiers killed and wounded in the successive battles after the city was occupied. Although the enemy suffered heavier casualties, the Japanese army could not be without losses in many fierce battles. It is reported that the three books "Wheat and Soldiers," "Mud and Soldiers," and "Flowers and Soldiers" written by Sergeant Major Katsunori Tamai are widely sold.</p>

<p>Yang Jinhai from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 22 Xinle Village, Xinjiapo Road, was of humble origin. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he joined a certain side to assist in their work and repeatedly achieved merit, possessing great influence in the western Shanghai area. Recently, through the boasting of Luo Zhibin, a translator from the Japanese military police headquarters and a native of Jiangbei, Yang was recently appointed as the captain of the 8th Brigade of the "Shanghai West Self-Defense Corps."</p>
<p>A Petty Person Who Achieved Success</p>
<p>Was exceedingly delighted, and Luo also obtained an important position in the brigade. In order to flaunt their newly acquired official positions, the two of them held a banquet at 7 PM the night before in rooms 22 and 23 of the Wanli Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, inviting their cronies and friends. Their intention in choosing this restaurant was to take advantage of the auspicious "Wanli" (ten thousand profits) name. A total of five tables were set up that day, with more than 40 guests attending. At 7:20 PM, just as the banquet was underway and everyone was enjoying themselves, three uninvited guests suddenly rushed in. Upon reaching the table, they each took out their handguns,</p>
<p>including Mauser pistols</p>
<p>And other weapons and fired more than ten shots continuously at the hosts, Yang Jinhai and Luo Zhibin. Yang was hit by a total of ten bullets, all in vital areas, and immediately fell to the ground dead. Luo was initially hit in the forehead by one bullet and fell. The assassins then added another shot to his back, causing him to die immediately as well. Although the assassins were in a hasty and panicked state, their bullets all concentrated on Yang and Luo, and none of the other people at the table were injured.</p>
<p>After the Incident</p>
<p>The Lao Zha (old gate) Police Station immediately received a report and detectives Zhang Keqin, Li Pengfei, and Huang Cifu rushed to the scene to make arrests. However, the assassins had already calmly fled, and most of the guests at the table with the two dead men scattered amidst the chaos. Those who remained were Pan Yasheng (an employee of the Japanese military police department) from Shanghai, Zhou Xilian, Yang Jinxi and Yang Shanfu from Zhenjiang, Yang Ganquan from Jiangbei, Zhang Jibin from Shanghai, Gui Qing, Wang Mingtang, Ji Dequan, He Yutang, Mi Henglong, and Wang Guanhua from Yangzhou, Zhu Daozhang and Zhang Chengzhi from Anhui, and Su Chengzhi, Li Zhuqing, and Zhou Gongzhao, totaling seventeen people. The detectives</p>
<p>Recovered Shell Casings</p>
<p>Twelve shell casings and five bullets from the scene. In addition to transporting the bodies of the two deceased to the coroner's office for examination, the seventeen remaining guests were considered suspects and subject to investigation. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao, briefly explained the circumstances, stating that the seventeen suspects obtained were all related to this incident and required further investigation. If it was determined that they were not involved, the court was requested to release them. Currently, a petition was being made to</p>
<p>Approve Detention</p>
<p>For one week. According to rumors, this tragic event occurred entirely due to internal strife among Yang Jinhai and his associates. It is said that the newly appointed "Self-Defense Corps Captain" was originally a lucrative position, leading to fierce competition among various parties beforehand. Yang's appointment to this position was also due to the assistance of others, but once he obtained the position, he disregarded them. Unexpectedly, a tragic incident occurred at the celebration banquet, so the aforementioned possibility may not be without its basis.</p>

<p>At approximately 7:20 PM yesterday, more than ten bandits suddenly broke into a certain house at No. 300, Aidooah Road, for robbery. Five of the bandits, wielding handguns, restrained all the people in the house. Other bandits took the opportunity to search each room, overturning boxes and ransacking everything. As a result, the stolen cash and belongings amounted to more than 2,500 yuan before they escaped. The victim reported the incident to the police station, who are investigating the case.</p>

<p>At 9:30 AM on the 8th, the British Imperial Airways civilian aircraft "Datanus" heading from Hong Kong to Bangkok,</p>
<p>was forced to land by Japanese military aircraft while passing Zhou Island. Last night, the spokesperson of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai stated at a press briefing that the aircraft</p>
<p>Was forced to land because it flew into a prohibited area. At 9:30 AM that day, a Japanese military aircraft spotted the "Datanus" flying at an altitude of 670 feet, 5 miles away from Zhou Island. The action was taken because it was considered a violation of the Japanese naval authorities' declaration issued in February of this year,</p>
<p>And it forced the landing on the beach of Zhou Island. Aside from the damage to the left tire, the aircraft sustained no other losses. A total of five people were on board the aircraft. The Japanese military used a naval aircraft yesterday to transport three of the passengers to Guangzhou. The three passengers, one Norwegian, one American, and one Iranian, were all handed over to the</p>
<p>British consulate in Guangzhou. The two British pilots, Mr. Wilson (30 years old) and Mr. Rebhorn (25 years old), are still being detained for interrogation. The aircraft will be returned to British Airways after it is repaired. The Japanese navy's declaration that the aircraft violated was issued on the 2nd of this month by the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, advising all countries' aircraft not to fly within a 15-mile radius of Zhou Island and not to fly at an altitude below 1,700 feet.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Jewish Refugees – Set Up a Court Without Authorization – Do Not Apply Chinese Law – Cai Xiaobai Writes to the Public Concession Requesting Thorough Investigation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Most nations that treat our people with equality automatically abolish consular jurisdiction, demonstrating respect for our country's judiciary. Our country's government and people respect the rights and interests of foreigners even more. Even for stateless White Russian and Jewish refugees, our country has never harmed their legal rights and interests. Unexpectedly, Jewish refugees have recently followed in the footsteps of the great powers, undermining our country's legal authority by setting up a court in eastern Shanghai without authorization. Their judgments do not apply Chinese law. Mr. Cai Xiaobai, a lawyer in this city, specifically submitted a letter to the Lawyers Association yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation. The original text of lawyer Cai's letter to the Lawyers Association is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, I have learned that Jewish refugees, who were expelled from Germany and came to Shanghai, have recently organized a conciliation court without authorization at No. 66 Aierkaoke Road in eastern Shanghai. They have already begun handling cases and have established 15 articles of court regulations (full text attached). The main points are translated as follows: (1) Jewish people are prohibited from filing lawsuits in Chinese courts; otherwise, they will be punished. (2) Conciliation fees will be charged. (3) Lawyers registered with the court are allowed to appear in court. (4) Judgments do not apply Chinese law. (5) Judges and staff are formally appointed and receive salaries. This organization not only despises our country's courts but also undermines law and order. I specifically suggest that a thorough investigation and prevention should be conducted immediately. Sincerely, Member Cai Xiaobai," It is also known that the false court is currently scheduled to hear cases every Monday and Friday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. If the amount involved in a financial dispute is more than 500 yuan, a lawyer registered with the false court must be hired to appear in court.</p>

<p>The Elementary Middle School for Refugee Children in this city was established with the assistance of charitable organizations. After two years of operation, it has achieved considerable success. Many students have advanced to higher education and entered the workforce. The school was originally located in Xuyuan on Kang'naotu Road. After suffering a fire this spring, it was able to restore its former appearance thanks to the relief from charitable organizations. This semester, it received subsidies from charitable groups again and built two thatched huts on the open space behind the Sheng Clan Ancestral Hall at No. 11 Jisi Fei Road to serve as school buildings, in order to expand its scope and benefit refugee students. Unexpectedly, less than two weeks after moving in, Japanese and puppet troops and police invaded the area to build roads across the border, suddenly occupying a portion of the Sheng residence. As a result, the school's environment deteriorated. The residence was originally borrowed by the Cilian Branch, which established the 31st Refugee Shelter there. In the middle of last month, all the refugees were forcibly expelled by the Japanese and puppet forces. The school is now facing the same fate, being forced to move out. It had no choice but to temporarily distribute all the students to the Cilian Branch's Third San, 34th, and 58th Refugee Shelters for temporary accommodation, while awaiting further relief methods to be determined by charitable organizations.</p>

<p>The seven Portuguese vessels were suddenly released on the 4th of this month. The companies have not actually taken over them, so the truth is unclear. It is rumored that someone impersonated the shipowner to register with the puppet organization first and then negotiated with the Japanese Navy to obtain the release. As for the Portuguese merchant Far East Company's ship "Fada", the rumor says that it was also registered with the puppet regime before being released. Yesterday, the company officially announced a denial, denying that "Fada" was registered with the puppet regime. As for the release, it was not involved at all. It is believed that there is another organization involved in the release of the Portuguese vessels this time.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou and Shantou, various shipping companies have opened new routes to Haiphong, Saigon, and other places, and transportation has been flourishing. Later, due to the European incident, foreign exchange became extremely tight, and Hong Kong dollars were changed to Hong Kong dollars. However, various irregular shipping companies still calculated in national currency, and Hakka naturally changed to irregular ships. Therefore, the profits of various irregular shipping companies have multiplied, and they have been renting ships to operate. Recently, it has been heard that the Shanghai branch of Qiacheng Shipping Company at No. 12 Fada Road has been managing various shipping lines to the North and South Seas, and its business is developing rapidly. Now, it has also been entrusted by the London Crowford Company (transliteration) to act as an agent for the rental of the company's ships. Many large and small ships, such as the Baoweike, Guangji, and Liji, have been leased by the company and sailed because the business is becoming more and more prosperous. It has established branches in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, India, and other places to facilitate communication.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," a message from Xuzhou, northern Jiangsu Province, today (10th) states that of the two Canadian Jesuit priests who were shot and injured by Japanese sentries in Yaolou, near Xuzhou, on the 28th of this month, one, Reverend Kang Wen, has died from his injuries. His companion, Reverend Fang Tai'en, is still being cared for by doctors. According to Reverend Kang, Reverend Fang, and another reverend, the three were riding bicycles towards Xuzhou after midday that day. When they passed Yaolou, ten miles outside the city, they were shot at by Japanese sentries. Reverend Kang Wen was the first to fall, followed by Reverend Fang Tai'en. The third reverend was alert and threw himself to the ground, thus avoiding possible injury or death. After firing the shots, the Japanese sentries ran towards the injured men. It is said that when they recognized the injured men as foreign priests, they provided first aid and then summoned a doctor to treat them. At the time, the three reverends were wearing black Chinese clothing and white hats, and they were traveling very fast. The Japanese sentries ordered them to stop from 140 yards away, but when the order was not obeyed, they fired.</p>

<p>Chen A'gen, a resident of Shanghai, from Ningbo, nicknamed "Carpenter A'gen," residing at No. 39 Pi Shaonai Road outside Xiaobeimen, French Concession, is 30 years old this year and has been selling heroin and morphine for a living. He used to purchase from Chen Lin, a young woman from Chaozhou (25 years old this year) residing at No. 4, Lane 94, Aidooah Road, British Concession, but then suddenly started purchasing from elsewhere. On the afternoon of the 19th of last month, Chen Lin went to Chen A'gen's house to collect the remaining 50 yuan owed for the goods and blamed him for</p>
<p>Being A Longtime Customer</p>
<p>And not buying from her anymore. Chen A'gen replied that her goods were of inferior quality and difficult to sell, unlike the high-quality goods from elsewhere, which were easier to sell. He took out a package of white powder to show Lin, asking her to judge the quality. Lin accepted it, opened the package, and brought it to her nose to smell it. Unexpectedly, during inhalation, the poisonous powder flew into her nasal passages and directly into her brain, causing her to be poisoned. She immediately fainted and lost consciousness. Chen A'gen was greatly alarmed when he saw this and immediately sprayed her with clean water for</p>
<p>Unsuccessful First Aid</p>
<p>Then ordered his friend, Xiao Yongshou, who was also from his hometown, to rush to notify her brother, Lin Zaokun, to come. They delayed until 6 AM the next morning, when they hired a car to take Chen Lin to the Chaozhou Heji Hospital in Hong'anfang, Luban Road, for treatment. Doctor Shen Dingyang diagnosed her and gave her two doses of a heart stimulant, but they were still unable to save her. She soon died. Later, the Heji Hospital, due to accepting bribes, deliberately concealed the incident and did not report it to the police station. Chen A'gen, on the other hand, enlisted people to mediate with the deceased's family, compensating them with several hundred yuan for the loss,</p>
<p>And Settled Privately</p>
<p>The matter was settled. The family prepared a coffin and collected the body, which was placed in a room for storage. The matter has passed. Now, French Concession detectives Dai Rongji and Ni Jinrong have investigated and found that Chen and others had settled a major death case privately, and that Heji Hospital had accepted bribes and concealed the incident, violating regulations. They arrested Chen A'gen, Lin Zaokun, Xiao Yongshou, and Hu Xianrong (manager of the Heji Hospital accounting office) one after another, and first escorted them to the Special No. 2 District Court, requesting</p>
<p>Detention for Investigation</p>
<p>Before prosecution. At the same time, they tracked down the location of the body and coffin. After three days of investigation, they finally learned that the body and coffin were stored in the Tonghai Coffin Storage Office on Daxi Road. When they went to investigate, the office refused to acknowledge it, denying that they had received and stored the coffin. They then arrested Wang, the accountant of the office, for questioning, and he admitted that they had received and stored it. Yesterday morning, they transported the body and coffin to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Coroner's Office and reported to the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 District Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the office at noon to open the coffin and examine the body. The result of the identification was that Chen Lin</p>
<p>Died from Poisoning</p>
<p>The police also sent the arrested Chen Lin, Xiao Hu, and four other criminals, along with doctor Shen Dingyang, to the case. After the prosecutor questioned them in detail, he ordered the body to be handed over to Lin Zaokun for collection. The police department is investigating and verifying the concealment of the body and the cause of death.</p>

<p>Surrounding and Searching the Dongfang Hotel</p>
<p>Recently, terrorist incidents have continued to occur in the concessions. Therefore, the police authorities of the two concessions have strengthened their prevention measures. At 9 PM on the 9th, the Public Concession, based on confidential information, dispatched more than a dozen members of the reserve team, two red police cars, and more than fifty British soldiers to surround the Dongfang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road and conduct a large-scale search, prohibiting travelers from entering or exiting.

<p>Robber Gang of Tossed Hats (Toss Top Hats) Swept Away</p>
<p>As the weather gradually turns colder, the hat-snatching thieves (commonly known as "Toss Top Hats") have risen. The French Concession Police Department believes that these illegal elements affect public safety, so they have ordered the detectives to strictly arrest them during this winter prevention period in order to ensure the safety of travelers. It is learned that after the police department's efforts to investigate and arrest them, more than sixty hat-snatching thieves were arrested on one day yesterday, sweeping them away.

Little Hubei fled after the incident. Kuang attempted to escape but failed and was arrested for investigation. The French Concession Police Department believes that Kuang is suspected of inciting murder and yesterday sent him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, requesting detention for investigation. After reviewing the record, the court ordered the defendant to be detained and scheduled another interrogation for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The informal market for US-British exchange was quiet due to the impending holiday. Trading was mediocre and the trend was slightly loose, as the various bullish sentiments that had permeated the market yesterday and the day before had gradually dissipated. Moreover, the widespread rumors of Germany's impending invasion of the Netherlands and Hitler's war rhetoric continued to shatter any illusions of peace in Europe. Consequently, overseas US-British exchange rates contracted further, falling by more than six points (after falling for six consecutive days, a total of 1.125 points). This caused the market to open with a familiar pattern of even British and tight US dollars. Soon after, Hong Kong banks and Chinese banks began selling. Although arbitrageurs initially seized the opportunity to buy on behalf of certain parties, the rate had already loosened to 5.21875 and 8.375. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and Sassoon also joined in the buying, pushing the rate back to 5.09375 and 8.1875. However, after that, Citibank, a foreign bank, offered to sell, and arbitrageurs also considered taking profits, causing the rate to harden again to 5.21875 and 8.28125. In the afternoon, the power company came to the market to settle accounts, momentarily tightening the rate to 5.09375 and 8.125. But after lingering for a long time, foreign banks suddenly began to sell. The closing price was still stable, with British gold at 5.1875 and the US exchange rate at 8.1875 (equivalent to a US-British exchange rate of only 3.788). Compared to the previous day, British exchange was looser by 0.125, while the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125. The futures market mirrored the spot market, with active trading throughout the day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Banks Lead the Selling</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's forward and spot rates were even, the price of silver in New York remained flat, and the price of raw gold in London was unchanged. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai dollars, and French francs was flat. The US dollar continued to fall sharply against the British pound by six points, against the Shanghai dollar by 0.48 points, and against the French franc by a slight 0.031875 points. The Central Bank's listed rates remained unchanged. At the opening of the bank's spot selling prices, British gold was 5.0625, and the British exchange rate was 8.125. Compared to the previous close, British was even and the US dollar tightened by 0.09375, due to the sharp decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric led the selling, and Chinese banks also came to sell. Although arbitrageurs seized the opportunity to buy on behalf of certain parties, the position was still quite ample, so the market ended up tightening. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to arbitrageurs, HSBC, and other foreign banks at 5.125 and 5.1875, and spot US dollars from 8.25 to 8.3125. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the Silver Equalization Tax was also announced unchanged. Thereafter, it was shouted up to 5.2875 and 8.375. Then Sassoon suddenly bought in, and at the same time, Chinese merchants also made purchases, so the trend suddenly turned tight. It is estimated that foreign banks, Citibank, and certain banks bought in spot British gold at 5.15625 and 5.125, and spot US dollars at 8.3125 and 8.25. Later, it was called down to 5.09375 and 8.1875. Near noon, the buying wind gradually subsided, and Citibank's selling intentions suddenly intensified, and British banks and arbitrageurs also resumed selling slightly, so the situation trended towards firmness again. It is estimated that they sold spot British gold to Chinese merchants and counterparts at 5.1875 and 5.21875, and spot US dollars at 8.25 and 8.28125. Extended to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold at 5.1875, and the US dollar at 8.25.

<h3 id="e96">The Buying Wind Has Wained, Gold Market Slightly Declines <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market conditions saw a resurgence of selling due to the sudden shift to looseness in the exchange market. Most retail longs had short-term thinking and were extremely willing to close out with thin profits at any time. Therefore, influenced by the firmness of the foreign exchange market at the morning opening, it immediately fell sharply by 50 yuan to open at 3,680 yuan. For a time, the downward trend was very strong, and the lowest level once retreated to 3,650 yuan. Because the exchange market turned soft, major Hong Kong banks bought in and certain gold firms and money changers bought in a considerable amount, rising several times to 3,720 yuan. However, shortly after, the foreign exchange rate hardened again, and at this time, silver building banks and cash firms sold with great effort, so the price could not be sustained and fell to 3,675 yuan. Fortunately, the buying intention of gold firms re-emerged, and certain silver firms also came to search for it. This was because the exchange market had turned from loose to flat. By noon, it was still 3,705 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange suddenly reported firmness, rising by 40 yuan, reaching a peak of 3,745 yuan. Before the close, the exchange market was still reported as loose and flat, coupled with retail sales, retreated to 3,717 yuan at the close. As a result, the profit was reduced by 13 yuan, and the transaction was still active, around 1,500 taels. The price of silver building jewelry was reduced by 5 yuan, and the price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Fell 13 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially weakened due to the convenience of the foreign exchange market, and the situation also tended to weaken. The market opened with a small decrease of 50 yuan, and money changers did 20 taels among themselves, at 3,680 yuan. Then, because the exchange market was still reported as loosening, and silver building banks and money changers came to sell, it fell by another 30 yuan. The money changers gave 10 taels to gold firms, at 3,650 yuan. At that time, certain silver buildings launched purchases on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and certain gold firms also searched for purchases on behalf of speculators, and at the same time, foreign exchange rebounded, and soon recovered by 70 yuan. Certain silver buildings bought 30 taels from securities banks, at 3,720 yuan. Later, securities banks and retail investors sold hard, and soon fell by 30 yuan, and money changers did 40 taels among themselves, at 3,690 yuan. After that, certain money changers suddenly bought in, aggressively buying more than 200 taels, and re-fathered the price to 3,720 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange was re-reported as hardening, the selling trend suddenly intensified, and cash firms, money changers, and silver banks scrambled to sell, and guest banks stopped buying, so it could not be sustained and plummeted by 45 yuan. Gold firms sold 20 taels to money changers, at 3,675 yuan. Later, certain gold firms came to pull it up, and the market trend stabilized, rising by more than 10 yuan. By the time of closing, certain silver buildings and gold firms also came to fish in, and the foreign exchange had stopped loosening and turned flat, so it rose by more than 10 yuan again. Certain Yu firms bought 40 taels from securities banks, at 3,705 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, it was strong, and the market opened 25 yuan higher, and certain silver buildings bought 20 taels from money changers, at 3,712 yuan. Subsequently, securities banks sold hard for more than 100 taels, and fell back 15 yuan. Securities banks sold 50 taels to silver building banks, at 3,715 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange was hardening, and certain securities banks also came to search for purchases, and Hong Kong banks all had purchases, so it soared again by 30 yuan, and securities banks bought 30 taels from money changers, at 3,745 yuan. After that, silver building banks seized the opportunity to hedge and sell, and certain gold firms also closed out long positions, and the foreign exchange rebounded, falling by 30 yuan, and silver building banks did 20 taels among themselves, at 3,715 yuan. After entering the market, certain money changers pulled it up, rising by 15 yuan, and money changers did 10 taels among themselves, at 3,730 yuan. Later, because retail investors sold, it fell again by 13 yuan, and money changers forked and did 20 taels among themselves, at 3,717 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell back by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 95 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash firm's brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Reduced by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael was still 380 yuan for major firms. Until 9:35, the price was reduced by 5 yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, major firms changed to 375 yuan, and new firms had the same price as the previous price. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Foreign Currencies Hover and Soften <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no strong demand for British and American gold pounds, and the American gold pound showed a slight firmness. British and American gold bills fell following the decline in the pound exchange rate, while demand for American gold bills was very strong, and the market remained stable. The supply of Hong Kong franc bills was also smooth, and the market was loose. Demand for Singapore and Dutch bills was relatively scarce, and prices were weak and declined.

<p>Yesterday's informal securities market remained weak due to a lack of investor confidence. Although the downward trend felt slightly reduced, it still lacked vitality. However, having fallen by several yuan over the past few days, the amount of unsecured positions has gradually increased, and caution should be taken against a rebound. The pressure from all sides has loosened, and there is no exciting trading. Perhaps after a period of preparation, there will be further activity. Yesterday's situation saw a slight pullback in the morning, with prices slightly firm, but selling pressure remained stronger, moving slowly downstream. The noon close was still lower than the previous day. Afternoon trading was clearer, with supply still exceeding demand, falling by another 0.1 to 0.11, and the situation was slightly eased. As a result, it continued to decrease by 0.2 to 0.4. Type D was unique, decreasing by 0.95 due to the lottery relationship. The total number of transactions was estimated at 40 to 50 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Weak, Coarse Yarn Market Strong, Factories Open Sales One After Another, Sales Plateaus Fall Again <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, was dispirited yesterday due to the wavering of speculators caused by the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, and their buying intention was not firm, which was far more disappointing than the previous day. As a result, the market plateau declined. Although there was no large-scale development of actual demand, the Hong Kong banks' appetite for 10-count coarse yarn was still not weak. However, most of them directly opened sales to the factories, and the prices were considered cheap. Speculators did not hoard much of this cotton yarn in their hands, so the impact on the market was not great. However, the trading of 20-count fine yarn was still slow and sluggish. After the close of 20-count Double Horse, it decreased to 648 yuan, a decrease of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarn prices were flat.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, there were rumors of a loosening trend in the foreign exchange rate, and speculators scrambled to sell, and the price fell by 10 yuan. 20-count Double Horse started at 658 yuan, and gradually declined to 650 yuan. However, guest banks sold Double Horse and traded in 10-count coarse yarn, resulting in the price of fine yarn being weak and coarse yarn being high. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 915 bales were traded, compared to 1,415 bales on the previous day. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 6.5 yuan, Double Globe fell by 7 yuan, and Celestial Maiden fell by 5 yuan. Chongxin Factory opened 400 bales of 21-count Dafa, with a price of 620 yuan, and 200 bales of 10-count Dafa, with a price of 515 yuan. Tongyi Factory opened 100 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster, with a price of 630 yuan, and 100 bales of 13-count Golden Rooster, with a price of 635 yuan. Yong'an Factory opened 150 bales of 10-count Golden City, with a price of 550 yuan. Today, 135 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and another 180 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn purchased by each gang is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Cotton Transactions Still Lively Among Peers <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Although the transactions of this cotton are not thin, they are all transactions among peers. The selling price is slightly higher. The factory has not traded any packages, and the market remains stable. Overseas Indian and American cotton markets have improved and are advancing daily. Unfortunately, the foreign exchange rate has turned calm, and people's hearts are still quiet. The origin of northern Jiangsu includes 1,230 bales of general cotton and 270 bales of northern sand cotton. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded on the left (transaction prices are all for cash-on-delivery).</p>
<p>Another message from Shanghai indicates that foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days due to the unpredictable nature of the exchange rate. Peers are quite interested in buying, but it is unknown how to start. Japanese factories are also very quiet, as if they are waiting for something. Tens of thousands of bales of US cotton have already been shipped and are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month or the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was active from the beginning of the morning. Liverpool and Bombay telegrams reported good news. People were extremely excited due to the passage of the cotton loan regulations, and the market was extremely active, attracting strong purchases from all parties and the offsetting of some short positions. As a result, the closing price rose sharply by more than 10 British pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than 9 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 20 British pounds, and Liverpool rose by more than 30 pence.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Grains Guest Demand is Strong New Japonica Rice Follows <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the guest pointed rice market continued to rise, because the arrival of goods was still interrupted, and speculators took advantage of the trend to pull in. At the opening in the morning, there were hoarders who came out to search for it, resulting in most of the market goods being gone in an instant, and the market price immediately increased by half a yuan. However, the road to this village is ordinary, so the result is not as sensational as the previous market. It is estimated that Jiangbei rice closed at 24.2 to 23.8 yuan, and Jingwu special rice closed at 24.23 to 23.5 yuan. More than 20 cars of various goods such as new japonica rice arrived yesterday from Sujia Kuntai Fengqing, etc. In terms of sales, because the general appraisers saw the guest pointed rice rise all the way, the price standard of new japonica rice was relatively low, and they all did it smoothly. The guest vendors were also unwilling to release it lightly, so the market was generally flat and rebounded, with an increase of 4 to 5 cents. The price of Luyang pointed rice followed high by 2 to 3 cents, and the prices of Yao green rice and Yuan rice were all tight. The total number of transactions in the market was more than 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the guest Xian rice market rose again. The inventory of Jiangbei Xian rice will be exhausted, and the subsequent shipment has not arrived. Although there is a rumor that Wuhu Xian rice will be transported by Chinese merchants and Japanese merchants in cooperation, there is still a lack of a whole batch to arrive in port, and even large Japanese merchants have not transported in large quantities. The local market price has gradually followed. Therefore, the market was already firm at the opening in the morning. Then, a large hoarding bank absorbed more than 2,000 bags, which immediately soared by 5 to 6 cents. The asking price for Jiangbei Xian rice has reached more than 24 yuan, while Wuhu Xian rice has reached 24.3 yuan. In addition to hoarding banks,客鄉舖作 is also quite active, with more than 2,000 bags also being traded. However, in the subsequent market, the 客囤 stopped buying due to excessive price codes, and the situation was soft.</p>

<p>Since the factory price of flour was reduced by 1 cent, the retail transactions in this street have been slightly lively. However, the passenger transformation is difficult to stimulate for a while, because various miscellaneous brand flours are dumped everywhere in the inland, and the market is suddenly caught off guard. The Beiyang gang continues to process thousands of bags of off-grade flour. It is said that the No. 4 powder red god has been opened for 6.6 yuan, the Fuxin white bag flour has been opened for 5.2 yuan, and the cannon powder still needs 7.4 yuan. The guest sales are only a decoration. The total number of transactions in the market is estimated to be more than 30,000 bags, the No. 2 powder factory board is 7.3 yuan, and the return goods are less than 5 cents to 1 cent.</p>
<p>The origin of wheat is sparse, and the market supply is also lacking. Both buyers and sellers still have a holding state. The factory does not covet, and the new hoarders are also unwilling to buy at high prices. As a result, the market transaction is silent, and the Fufeng factory suppressed the price and purchased about 20,000 bags of wheat from Guandian Changxi Jingwu, etc., with a price of 11.3 to 10.92 yuan, which is already a depreciation of 2 to 3 cents compared to the previous.</p>

<p>Since the sesame market has been supported by the environment in the past two days, foreign banks have become active, and hoarders have been searching for stocks. People's hearts have rebounded violently, and market prices have been frequently raised. Yangzhou sesame has been opened to 26.5 yuan and 26.1 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded. Mingguang sesame has been opened to 26.5 yuan and 26.1 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded, Mingguang sesame 600 to 700 bags, with a price of 29.3 yuan. The yellow soybean market has also opened up, and the export market, Hong Kong and other gangs, are asking for it. The stomach in this street is also wide, so the market has been slightly transformed. The total market is estimated to open more than 200 bags of Taicang beans (the price is detailed in the market price column), 300 bags of Wuhu beans, 200 bags of Nanjing beans, more than 100 bags of Pinghu Du beans, and more than 200 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans.</p>

<p>According to the Dutch telegram, the price of raw white sugar was 11.50 Dutch guilders. According to the market association's draw, the foreign exchange rate has increased, and there has been another decline. The spot price of 24 raw white sugar initially fell by about 3 yuan, and then rebounded by about 1 yuan. As a result, it was weakly weakened by 2 yuan, with the price of the company being 50 to 50.05 yuan. The price of the foreign company was initially 50 yuan, then 50.05 to 50.09 yuan, and even 51.5 yuan. The re-export cargo was 40 to 40.5 yuan. The initial price of Taikoo cart white was reduced by 2.5 yuan, and the B mark was 54 yuan, which then rose to 55 to 55.5 yuan, which was still less than 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. CW mark and other products retreated according to the regulations, H mark cart red was 40 yuan, Dutch red was 41 yuan, this cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 50.5 yuan, No. 2 was 50 yuan, No. 3 was 49.5 yuan, No. 4 was 49 yuan, No. 1 ice was 61 yuan, Jingming ice was 62.5 yuan, and the national sugar only opened more than 80 pieces of Beihai Pianqing, 30 yuan.

<p>Xinghua longan cannot be continuously arrived because it needs to be exchanged for foreign exchange before it can be exported, and the cost is increased. It is heard that Lanzhu branches will be handled in the same way. From now on, the source will inevitably be scarce, and according to Zhangzhou telegrams, there are not many goods left, so be wary of further tightness.</p>

<p>Horse pants and large coats are still popular. At yesterday's public tea party, there were continued mutual consultations and transactions. Wholesale merchants have been opening up every day, but the arrival of imported goods is lacking. Most of the traders are domestic Shen woven products, and the standard market price is quite high. General factories say that raw materials are scarce and expensive, and use the excuse that expenses are rising to increase prices. The unified sales price of Yihe, Zhanghua, and Yinfeng brands is 11.5 yuan, and the goods must be shipped out in complete cash. Therefore, although the market situation shows a shortage of supply, most buyers want to search for the old goods before the top, because there is no need to set a price, which has caused the output of each factory to be mostly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US silk market still showed a weak trend. Yokohama spot fell by 60 yuan, and forward fell by 64 yuan. New York spot Japanese silk fell by 0.11 yuan, Shanghai silk fell by 0.03 yuan, Guangdong silk fell by 0.1 yuan, near-term fell by 0.06 yuan, and forward fell by 0.09 yuan. Foreign firms in this port have very strict price limits. The difference between the internal and external market prices of Jili Jingbai Factory and other products is as high as 100 yuan, resulting in a stalemate. On the one hand, it is also due to the fact that buying and selling are waiting and watching the rise and fall of exchange rates, so there were no transactions yesterday. Thirty packages of the previous day's silk ends were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The green tea market situation is not lonely. Needle eyebrow silk tea with excellent body bones has a smooth path. Ordinary Zhen eyebrows and Gongxi Xiu eyebrows and other goods are also sold. The whole city was purchased by Tongfu Baochang Baolong Yihe and other firms, more than 1,700 boxes of green tea. The market plateau is limited to needle eyebrows, which opened to 105 yuan, which is more than the previous price, and the rest are unchanged.

<p>Henan white coal, due to the long-term interruption of its source in the past, and the lack of high-priced goods, the industry has been intending to hold it, and is unwilling to release it lightly. Recently, affected by the influx of Hongji, sales have been sluggish, and the market situation has had to reduce the plateau and give way. The industry has been dismantling prices, although they are calling 106 yuan, but the hoarders' warehouse slips have fallen by 3 to 4 yuan, and the number of transactions is still not many.</p>

<p>Wenzhou charcoal was short of cash last month, and the market situation has been extended again and again. The highest price was 12 yuan per load.

<p>— Pei Chu</p>
<p>The most prominent aspect of the modern spirit is probably "action." By "action," I mean being able to say it, being able to do it, not fearing any obstacles, and definitely achieving success. Our modern civilization is the result of the achievements of our predecessors' actions.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I also went to visit a Chinese language exhibition and felt another meaning of "action," which is about culture. In this exhibition, I spent the longest time looking at the Bible exhibited by the Bible Society. It not only exhibited Bibles in various languages from all over the world for us to see, but also exhibited Bibles in various dialects of China. Among them, in addition to the Ningbo, Xiamen, or other city dialects that we easily see, there are also Bibles in special dialects from the southwest, northwest, and northeast regions of China. We have almost never heard of these dialects. I really cannot but admire the spirit of action of the Western missionaries!</p>
<p>For us, Western missionaries are just like our monks and Taoists, whose profession is to preach and who do not engage in secular affairs. Since they are otherworldly people, in our opinion, they are just like our monks and Taoists, who can just practice tranquility and enjoy blessings without having to plan too much and ask for trouble. However, they are not like that. They want to act. They can not only go deep into barren and dangerous places to preach their doctrines, but also promote culture in these places at the same time. They published these Bibles in special dialects! They, as missionaries, are already doing so much. Needless to say, those non-missionaries who specialize in secular affairs work even harder. No wonder they surpass us in both spirit and material things.</p>
<p>Therefore, I turned around and thought about ourselves. There are many things that we should do, but aren't we hindering them, making people afraid to act, or being constrained and giving up on them? Let's not talk about other things, but take the new writing system as an example. It is almost the same thing as the Bible in special dialects. What achievements have we made? Why are we so far behind them? And this work of special dialects is precisely what we should be responsible for.</p>
<p>However, I am not trying to make pessimistic or disappointing remarks after all. We all know how to act now, and many things are being done, or are being done. Language exhibition can be said to be a kind of action!</p>
<h3 id="e112">Mother <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ping</p>
<p>The noisy sounds of the street gradually sank into the night.</p>
<p>Rain—endlessly falling on the silent streets.</p>
<p>From the dimly lit and weary street lamps, I vaguely saw slender strands of rain. October 29th was quietly dragged away by the god of night, and the 30th struggled to come in the darkness.</p>
<p>It was such a quiet autumn rainy night that I hurriedly stepped on messy steps, stepping over the road that had been wetted by hundreds, thousands, and millions of tiny raindrops, and hurried home.</p>
<p>The shops with iron doors tightly closed slowly receded around me, and soon I was approaching my home.</p>
<p>Two dark circles, a stern mother's face, appeared before my eyes. She was depressed because of her daughter's late return; at this time, listening to the frequent sad sound of the rain, she anxiously and resentfully missed her daughter who had not yet returned home.</p>
<p>I clearly realized that she was suffering from her daughter's "change," and sometimes she couldn't bear it and would angrily lash out at her beloved daughter unintentionally. But I love her, without any hatred for her. Mother is the mother I will always love. Mother said that I am a girl, so how can I go far away? But girls should also have a bright future in this era. It will never be like my mother's era...</p>
<p>But I don't intend to leave her either.</p>
<p>Because of my father's early death, she struggled to raise her daughter—me—in a difficult and weak life. She often shed tears for her unhealthy and sickly daughter. For more than ten years, the feudal family only gave her coldness, disdain, and coercion; she had tasted the pain of the world. Her only daughter can comfort her, and her hope is also closely tied to her daughter, hoping to live a happy life in the future.</p>
<p>Now——</p>
<p>She is disappointed. Her daughter is gradually deviating from her hopes, shattering her many years of expectations for her daughter.</p>
<p>Mother's bitter face brought me depression. I was always thinking about how I could comfort my most beloved mother in the world? I can't make her wounded heart suffer again. Once, and once again, and again, I failed.</p>
<p>Pain pierced my heart, and my mind was full of doubts. How can I persuade my mother, and that day when my mother can understand her daughter and become Gorky's "Mother"?</p>
<p>I wandered on the street like this. The rain was still so drizzly.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Autumn and the Cold River <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ti</p>
<p>As long as I close my eyes, I cannot forget. A piece of virtual white floats on my eyes, the light is not dazzling, but it is so elegant, quiet, and gentle. It is as if I can imagine a vast and boundless river, where the sky and water meet, and the clear light is rendered on the painting, a piece of azure blue and a strip of green. The god crows and village drums have not been seen for many years, and spiders secretly fill the house with their formations. Under the thick dust, the vermilion paint of the pillars is buried. You can smell the bird droppings all over the ground. Occasionally, a few tiles fall beside the Buddhist shrine, covered with dust. A silent bell is sent from afar, and then you lean your body and listen to the sparrows chirping on the beams. It seems that autumn comes from the north of the river, or from the cold river. People living in the river city feel autumn earlier, and a dilapidated mountain is most suitable for autumn. When the reeds are blown by the wind and rise and fall with a rustling sound, when the boundless leaves of the villages are dyed yellow, you see everyone on the streets of the river city wearing thick padded jackets. There are few tourists in the temples in the dilapidated mountains all day long, and the stone benches and tables in the pavilions are even colder than ice. If you are clever, don't sit down. The new weather is clear and bright, the clear river is like a practice, and the desolation of the cold river brings a city of autumn, ...</p>
<p>Suddenly the calm waves trembled. There was such a day, when the night was dark and the wind was high, we heard the cries of many innocent people. In October, on a sailboat, on the north and south banks of the river, I spent more than ten days on the river. In the night sky dotted with starlight, the huge figure of the pagoda cast a shadow on the gray river. At night, we could hear the roaring waves hitting the boat, one wave after another. In the bleak morning when the mountain mist first opened, the mountains were green, the wind was high, and the sky was urgent. I couldn't say I loved the cold river anymore, and my heart was shrinking and I couldn't feel a trace of warmth. In the pale dawn of the reeds, thin branches swayed in the gray sky, and a dog barked in the cold. The deck was slippery, as if covered with a thin layer of ice. The dark shadows of the jungle surrounded a small village; there were sparse lights in the board door, and one or two "kerosene lamps" were also lit at the cable boat under the bridge, flickering in the square doorway. The sharp night wind, like scissors, passed through the cracks in the ship's planks and stung the face. Occasionally, looking out the window, it was a piece of silent darkness. Does the water of my hometown not flow here? Everyone wanted to explore all the unknown mysteries from the dark shadows, but they were all disappointed. The harbor of the river is winding, and the twists and turns are a bit strange. In front, behind, left, and right of the village, there is a vast expanse of water. Pointing the pole, the boat swung over, and the old man in the east helped the child on the west bank into the house. Day by day, the leaves on the shore were yellower than before, and people wearing cotton robes still had to bask in the sun. The river wind was biting, and the river water was even colder. Ten days of life on the boat consumed the remaining autumn without a trace. You say that is also a peaceful autumn, a cold river with a fluke of autumn? Ah, no, no. In a moment of drifting on the cold river, in the bleak October, I wrote the words "homesickness" on the river, on the yellow leaves of autumn. I miss Jiangcheng. I cannot forget a state of mind of autumn, the autumn river, the melancholy on the river.</p>
<p>I have spent two autumns, in this big city. When the spire of the church seems more gloomy in the evening wind, the autumn on the river is also deep. Flowing in the streets of towering buildings, the wind roars, rolling into a vortex like a swift current. On the streets near the Bund, the sunlight is as thin as winter. The wind on the river brings distant dreams, and a layer of virtual white floats on my eyes, and then a pile of melancholy, like dark clouds. On the shore where battleships and giant ships are crowded, I can see that piece of river, the autumn on the cold river.</p>
<p>Piled up in the thick dust, for many years the peaceful river, autumn, Jiangcheng, the god crows and village drums, under the shrine of Fo Li, ... I cannot say I love the cold river anymore. In the bleak October weather, on the vast river, the night of the waves, the morning of the frost, life is like an ant running around on a hot pot, that drifting bitterness! From the small city with dim lights on the water to a big city by the sea, I searched everywhere for the lost autumn. Autumn comes from the cold river, it is deep and then remains, one year, two years, three years. Maybe you can imagine a bit of the scenery of your hometown Jiangcheng from the Bund, but what about the lost autumn—from the disturbance, where should you take back a share of peace?</p>
<h3 id="e114">Introduction to "A Brief History of Late Qing Small Newspapers" <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Hui</p>
<p>There has never been a precise statistic on how many kinds of small newspapers there were in the late Qing Dynasty. According to the existing documents, Li Chuang Woluo Sheng's "Illustrated Anecdotes of Shanghai for Leisurely Reading" (1905) said that there were ten kinds of newspapers "using playful writing to provide people with leisure." The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Prosperity Daily, Laughing Forest Daily, Game Daily, Leisure Daily, Fable Daily, Collection Daily</p>
<p>New Shanghai Daily, Flower World, Flowery Days Daily, Spring River Flower Moon Daily</p>
<p>Nan Ting Ting Zhang's "List of Lost Newspapers in Shanghai" (1906) listed more, a total of sixty-six kinds. However, most of them are still newspapers that report current events. Only the following twelve kinds can be determined as small newspapers:</p>
<p>Art Forest Daily, Strange News Daily, Strange New Daily, Laughing Daily, Handbook Daily, Flying Daily</p>
<p>Spring River Flower Moon Daily, Laughing Daily, Interesting Daily, China Small Daily, Leisure Daily, Literature Club</p>
<p>Daily</p>
<p>Combined with the "Miscellaneous Records of Leisurely Reading," there are a total of twenty kinds. Later works on the history of newspapers also occasionally touched on this, but they only briefly mentioned the numbers of "Prosperity," "Games," "Fables," and "Collection." Unexpectedly, I accidentally obtained seven kinds that were not found in the lists of Woluo Sheng and Nan Ting Ting Zhang:</p>
<p>Entertainment Leisure Daily, Romance Vernacular Daily, Dialect Daily, Suzhou Vernacular Daily, Popular</p>
<p>News, Auspicious Shadows Daily, and Live in the Moment Daily</p>
<p>A total of twenty-seven kinds. This is the largest known number of small newspapers at that time. Among the twenty-seven kinds, the following seven have not been found: "New Shanghai," "Flower World," "Art Forest," "Strange News," "Strange New," "Laughing," and "Handbook." I am afraid that even the already found parts will eventually be lost, so I will describe the outlines of the twenty kinds that have been obtained to preserve them.</p>

<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>In the past, we knew that Hollywood film companies often had many misunderstandings about China, and derogatory films could often be found. Even in films with derogatory content, they would find Chinese actors to play humiliating roles. Didn't Anna May Wong play many such roles in the past?</p>
<p>But now, Hollywood film companies have realized the non-counting nature of this policy, because Hollywood films have a large market in China. If you transport this kind of film to China for screening, it will cause Chinese people's aversion. The things China has performed in the film are inconsistent with the facts. China is an ancient country that was civilized earliest, and she has an indelible splendid culture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chinese actors have also thoroughly realized in recent years that they only knew how to earn wages in the past, and everything was arranged by the producers or directors. They were asked to play what kind of role, and they played what kind of role. They didn't know anything about insulting China. Now, they know that playing this kind of role is insulting to their motherland, which will not only make their compatriots dissatisfied, but also affect their own future. Therefore, they have paid attention to this issue. In the future, when they encounter companies asking them to play derogatory roles, they will politely refuse.</p>
<p>Under this situation, Hollywood film companies will not only avoid making films with derogatory content in the future, but also decide not to have Chinese actors play roles such as child slaves and servants. This will eliminate disputes or misunderstandings caused by the public screening of films in China. And we believe that this war of resistance in China has changed the entire world, seeing that China is the largest country in the Far East with unlimited prospects. This is indeed a major reason for accelerating Hollywood's change of this policy!</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>"The Dictator," starring the screen comedian Chaplin, has been rumored for more than a year. The central consciousness of the film portrays a certain dictator in Europe as a poor little soldier, which inevitably causes international trouble. The film production has been suspended several times. Whenever Chaplin wants to continue filming, a secret group will warn him with threats to take his life. Chaplin has to add and delete content and rename it "The Great Dictator," but he still has no intention of completing it. After the start of the European War, the situation is of course different. Chaplin also became motivated and prepared to join the democratic front to fight for the Jews. In view of the fact that British and French film actors have returned to their countries to join the army, he recently closed himself in the Kemala room, buried himself in filming, working ten hours day and night, preparing to finish it quickly and increase the power of publicity. When Chaplin is filming, the guards outside the door are heavily guarded, with ten armed guards to prevent people from breaking in and disrupting. It is said that this film will instill political consciousness, not just satire. Chaplin also told a friend: "In short, Hitler is no laughing matter." Some news reporters believe that Chaplin has made a great determination to resist the war, and "The Dictator" will be his last work. After that, he will imitate the famous Shakespearean actor Sir Gielgud in Britain and join the British infantry and set off for the front line. If this is true, then Charlie Chaplin, the comedian of thirty years, has completely changed his style.</p>

<p>Xu Yunzhi recently started singing the new book "Hetongji" at Yalu Teahouse "Rimen." This book is taken from the Yue opera story of the true and false Wang Qingming. The Tan Huang theaters often perform it, which can attract audiences; and Xu is the pioneer in adapting it to string and wind instruments. It is said that the "script" is written by a certain chapter novel writer. Although the structure of the plot is generally not bad, the "chapter" is still not stable and is inevitably mediocre. It should be regarded as the same level as Zhu Zhao's "Crying and Laughing Marriage," so the old listeners have mixed praise and criticism for it.</p>
<p>Pin Fang recruited Kang Youhua, a famous artist from Kuanyi Society, to tell the Yangzhou book "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which reduced a good base for female storytellers in Puyu Society.</p>
<p>The Fuchun Night Teahouse is still closed. Recently, "Miao Wang" Xia Hesheng volunteered to recruit famous artists, and there is news that the night teahouse will reopen soon. Xia has done "New Year's file" in Fuchun this spring, and his reputation is not bad, which has achieved good results. This time, he has considerable confidence in the box office for "reopening the file."</p>
<p>Employees of Guangyu and Runyu Societies have always been very enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings. Now that all walks of life in Shanghai are enthusiastically raising donations for winter clothes, the colleagues of the two societies have also initiated a large-scale singing association, storytelling association, and series opera activities to respond and raise donations on a large scale.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Life <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>I remember one day when I watched a drama at the Xuan Palace. When the curtain opened, there was a dancer living in the front room, with many modern furniture arranged. The dancer sat on a soft sofa, listening to the radio, talking to guests on the phone, and enjoying material civilization as much as possible. A country girl lived in the back pavilion, and a dying old woman was lying on a broken bed. The second landlord was chasing her like his life to ask her to pay the rent she owed. The country girl didn't know what to do, so she suddenly ran to the front room to ask the dancer for some help, to think of a way out for her to maintain her life. But the dancer loudly asked, do you want to live or live? If you want to live, you should persevere in maintaining the ambition you have set, and what does it matter if you are a little embarrassed or hungry. If you want to live, what you can sell now is your flesh. (The general idea is like this.) At that time, there were several dancers in the audience who frequently wiped their eyes with handkerchiefs, probably shedding tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>"I did evil in my previous life, and I am a dancer in this life." Even the red star with a monthly income of more than a thousand yuan also said so. However, in the eyes of a group of poor women, dancers eat delicacies, wear woolen silk, and there are many gentlemen and young masters who pursue and flatter them. What's so bad about that? Alas, swallow the broken teeth into your stomach, and you know the suffering yourself. Currently, at the Paramount, there are two red stars who told me that I really believe and sympathize with their plight. A friend objected, "You are not a dancer, how do you know the suffering of dancers?" I said, "You are not me, how do you know I don't know the suffering of dancers?" This is just copying the old article of Mr. Zhuang, but unfortunately that friend doesn't understand, and he still wants to ask the two red stars to testify.</p>
<p>According to this, is it possible for dancers to only seek to live and not to live? No, no, there are many prominent people who drive in high carriages and驷, but they are not living, they are just living luxuriously. The Western philosopher said, "People eat to live, not live to eat." Therefore, the two words "life" must be put together to have meaning, otherwise it will become a walking dead. But this is a question of knowledge, not a question of occupation. In any industry, there are virtuous people and there are scoundrels. Confucius said, "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning, and at thirty I stood firm..." Dancers, do you want to live? You should first humbly study, learn some knowledge, learn the principles of being a human being. When you discover the bright road of life, you will definitely have the joy and ambition to move forward, and you will no longer feel world-weariness and distress.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>A Drama that Praises National Heroes</p>
<p>Chinese dramas are mostly entertaining in nature. There are also many who advocate old virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, but there are very few who praise national heroes and can be called national defense dramas. There is a Kunqu opera called "Ningwu Pass," also known as "A Family of Martyrs," which does meet the above two conditions. However, the lyrics are profound and the music is high and few can sing it. Kunqu opera is gradually declining and on the verge of extinction. On the contrary, Pihuang, which has a shorter history, can be popularized throughout the country and is warmly welcomed by people of all levels. Therefore, it is a pity that there is such a good drama, which can also be adapted to the ideological trend of modern times, but it is buried and gradually forgotten by the world. If drama lovers do not actively promote it, I am afraid that within a few years, there will be a lament for the loss of good works and the dispersal of songs in Guangling. Therefore, I am now specially narrating the plot of the drama to arouse the attention of the Chinese people. If playwrights can adapt it into Pihuang and have a capable bearded male lead actor who is proficient in both martial arts and literature perform it, it is expected that it will inspire people's hearts today and gain the warm approval of the audience.</p>
<p>In the late Ming Dynasty, eunuchs monopolized power and politics were corrupt. Although Emperor Chongzhen was not a monarch who brought about the downfall of the country, the imperial government had deteriorated to the point where it could not be remedied. Traitors deceived the emperor, and heavy taxes were levied. The roving bandits rose up everywhere, and the Qing soldiers took advantage of the opportunity to invade from outside. The rebellious thieves disturbed from within. Even with the wisdom of Emperor Sizong, the general trend was gone and could not be reversed. Among the officials, only the eunuch Wang Chengen and the general Li Guozhen were wholeheartedly devoted to the country and sacrificed themselves for the country after Yuan Chonghuan. (138)</p>
<h3 id="e121">Amateur Music Concert <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Yun</p>
<p>At 8 pm on the 19th of this month, there will be a grand music concert at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The participants in this music concert include the best amateur musicians in Shanghai, the Conservatory of Music, and the singing classes of various amateur groups, all with their best personnel participating. It can also be said that this "Shanghai Amateur Music Circle Concert" is a total mobilization of amateur music talents in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In terms of programs, there are solo piano, violin, guitar, etc., ensemble and solo singing, etc. The most eye-catching is the large chorus of more than one hundred people, which gathers the essence of each group. The program to be sung has been decided to be Huang Zi's posthumous work, but which song has not yet been decided. It is probably nothing more than "The Flag is Flying" and "The Hunt."</p>
<p>In terms of ticket prices, there are two types: one yuan and two yuan. This is because the YMCA does not have many seats originally, and some of them have to be reserved for the performers themselves, so it has to be like this. In addition to being sold at the venue on the day of the event, tickets were also sold in advance to all walks of life, so it is probably no problem to be full.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," small-scale concerts of a recreational nature have been held from time to time, but this is the first time that the elites of the entire music world have gathered together. It symbolizes the unity of the amateur music world on the "isolated island," and it is the starting point for establishing the expansion from quantity to quality.</p>
