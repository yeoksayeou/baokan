<h3 id="c5">對於國聯會議的希望 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>十六日起有日內瓦開始舉行的國聯行政院第一零四屆常會，已將中國代表所提出的關於日本侵略的申訴，列爲重要的議題。在這次會議舉行前兩天，英國政府曾送一牒文於日本政府，內容和去年除夕美國對日本所提出的致相同，堅决吾認日本所謂「遠東新秩序」，痛斥日九國公約的野心；接着法政府也於日昨（十七日）對日本提出同樣的牒文。這幾件事的發動，恰巧是在這次舉行國聯行政院常會的前後，對於這次會議是吾有所關聯，姑且不論；不過國聯主要台柱的英法，旣已追隨美國，對日採取强硬態度，那末在這次會議中討論中日爭端的時候，他們爲和平，爲正義，爲本身權益計，想必要更進一步領導各會員國家，對日本的侵略暴行，决定實行一種有效的應付辦法。</p>
<p>中國自前年中日戰爭發生以來，每逢國聯召開會議的時候，對於日本的侵略暴行都有所申訴，同時國聯也都有正義的表示；前年十二月曾通過各會員國個別援助中國案，去年十月又議决由會員國個別執行明盟的第十六條的規定。可是因爲各會員國祗顧本身利害關係，尤其是英法兩國不願採取積極的行動，致一切議决案都變成官樣文章，結果不僅對日制裁沒有實行，就是對中國所急需的經濟援助，也並沒有積極的促其實現，一直到去年十一月，才得到英國一筆信用貸欵。英法各國過去之所以不能策動國聯對中國積極予以援助，歐洲局勢緊張的牽制，固有相當關係；而英國之冀圖於妥協政策下保全在華權利，更是一個重大的原因。最近日本對於英國的妥協政策，已不想繼續利用，正在進行根除歐美在華勢力的工作，欲由破壞在華歐美商業與投資，進而企圖取消歐美人士在華的一切權益。過去英國的抗議，固然是毫無效力，就是最近所提出的强硬牒文，據說日本也將採取同樣態度的答覆。足見紙上抗議總是無濟於事，而需要實際　動了。如果英國要保全她在遠東的權益，這時祗有聯合　國策動國聯實行對日經濟制裁，方足令侵略者有所顧忌。並且對日經濟制裁，英國及其屬地，尤居主要地位。日本軍需品的取給，除軍火一部來自英本國外，棉花大都來自印度，石油來自婆羅洲，羊毛來自澳洲；而日本日用雜貨的銷塲，更大部分以英屬殖民地爲主要市塲，所以英國如果倡行對日經濟制裁，實屬輕而易舉，收效特巨。</p>
<p>從前英法等國，時常怕美國不能和國聯合作，會使她們在外交上陷於孤立的地位，這也是國聯不能實行對日制裁的另一原因。其實國聯過去所通過的議案，各會員國尚未實施的，如禁止軍火輸日，和經濟援助中國，最近已在美國首先實行；那麼現在所成爲問題的，倒不是美國不和國聯合作，而是國聯願不願意和美國合作了。美國會現時正在討論中立法修正案與經濟制裁日本案，這和國聯過去所通過的援華案恰相呼應，如國聯於此時切實宣佈施行盟的第十六條的規定，則使美國中立法的修正和經濟制裁日本等案，在得到國聯精神上的鼓勵後，必能很順利地進行，更可以增大國聯對日制裁的力量。</p>
<p>國聯過去對於遠束問題不能設法切實解决，使她的威信蒙受很重大的打擊。這一座日內瓦的和平殿堂，不獨具有法西斯氣味的侵略國家，曉得牠是無用，儘可棄之如遺；便是深具同情正義的民治國家，也都覺得國聯無靈，不足保障世界和平。現在國聯想要亡羊補牢，爲時尙不算晚，對於中國這决的申訴，總應切實施行那有效的解决辦法。今日本報所載中國首席代表顧維鈞在大會中所提出的要求，如對日財政經濟的制限，抵制日貨，禁止戰爭原料飛機汽油運往日本，對中國金融經濟上積極援助，給予輸華軍火出口和運輸上的便利，都還是國聯盟的第十六條的引用。這本是上屆大會已經通過而未爲各會員國所執行的，現在國聯應即迅速使各會員國家履行盟約下的義務，並且必須由個別援助中國而變爲共同援助中國。以現時情形而論，美國既已對華實施援助，國聯倘能和美國密切合作，以集體的力量，一方面在經濟上軍火上援助中國，加强中國抗戰的力量，一方面在日本貧弱的經濟上，施以重大的壓迫，則即可給侵略者以最大的打擊，而促令遠東戰事早日結束，國聯的威信也可立即恢復，而世界的和平，也就眞的有了集體安全的保障。這在國聯曾員國家，不過盡其應盡的義務，而中國爲抵抗暴力侵略能得到正義公道的援助，自然要更加感激奮發了。</p>

<p>— 陳劍</p>
<p>以總訓育之大成、軍事及童軍訓練與管理、也同一個時候並進、並且自初中三年級起、便實行軍訓、其他行政組織、一如一般學校、敎務訓育事務、也分作三組、各設組長一人、聯校校長、由省政府主席擔任、副校長由敎育廳長兼充、且秉承校長執行校務、負實際行政責任、至各分校主管人員、則稱爲主任、其實等於一個校長、另有校本部爲一承轉策動機關、爲執行敎導事務起見、內中設敎導事務兩組、各設組長一人、及職員數人、分負專責、敎導組因爲包括訓育、工作特別繁忙、加設副組長一人、同以前江蘇厲行訓敎合一制時一樣、校本部職務、大概偏重於新事業、新制度、新設備集中的設計試騐或購辦，此外僅僅居於指導考核的地位罷了、</p>
<p>（四）分校主任的遴選　本年七月下旬、本省開始辦理中等學校、敎職員暑期講習會、隸屬中央訓練團、在武昌珞珈山武漢大學內舉行、所有全省公私立中等學校敎職員、除少數年老或有病的人外、曾一律入會講習、並嚴加軍事生活訓練、實行勞動服務及社會服務、同時請了許多黨國先進名流學者、講演一月、期滿後畢業、各分校主任、即在這一羣畢業會員之中選拔出來的、其選拔手續、採用個別談話、小組會議、及省府主席傳見考詢等方式、也曾參照各會員講習成績和軍訓程度、所以年齡少壯、體魄强健、也成了遴選主任的條件、</p>
<p>（五）分校敎職員的聘任　各分校敎職員的决定、由分校向敎育廳呈送擬聘名單、經廳核定指令之後、先行通知到校任職、再由聯中校本部聘任、其標準分五項、一、曾參與暑期講習會受過軍訓、二、適合中學規程所規定之敎員資格、三、經敎廳檢定合格、四、在敎學期內未經督學視察報告敎育廳、予以處分或警告、五、敎學成績優良、請假未參與珞珈山講習會、在上述第一至第四項標準之外，如必須增聘敎員、就適用弟五項規定、加「代用」字樣、他們的待遇、各分校高下相等、大概比較從前省立各校不免差一點，可是他們所負敎課和訓育的責任、却大加重、此係抗戰時期敎職員爲國服務不得不如此的、從前一八〇八年、德國斐希特不辭艱瘁、不怕强暴、在柏林向德意志國民連續作愛國講演、卒能喚醒民衆、參加抗戰工作、共同爭取最後的勝利、我們希望聯中敎職員、都有此種精神和成績、</p>
<p>（六）校務委員會的設立　這個委員會、是以校長副校長、敎廳秘書一人、第一第二科長、校本部秘書、及各分校主任、爲當然委員、並遴聘前任省市私立中等學校校長及本省辦學校有成績的人士、爲聘任委員、校務委員會係一會議機構、它的職權、規定爲一、各分校行政的聯絡、二、各分校行政的報告、三、課程的商討、四、訓育的規訂、五、經費的審核、六、建築設備的籌議、七、發展校務的策畫、每學期至少一次、由校長或副校長主席、在閉會期間、各委員得擔任各分校敎職或其他職務、不必常川住校、本部對於校務有改進的意見、可以送請校長或副校長採擇、這也是國立學校內一種創例、以較國立中學的校務委員也有些不同、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c50">公債本息改渝付欵　可在滬分期付款　一律為六期每期一個月　旨在便利持票人特通融之　財部決維持內債信用 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>財政部爲維持債信起見、對國內公債照常抽籤還本、中央銀行上海分行昨奉總行頒佈統一復興兩公債上海分期付款通融辦法、惟以後公債還本付息事宜、均由重慶總行及其委託之中國。交通。及中央信託局辦理、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>統一等債　均係關稅</p>
<p>以海關擔保之外債為善後借款、英德續借款、中英庚款、沙遜淮河借款、共英金二四·六一一·三六七鎊、及中法庚款、中比庚款、共美金二二五·五四六·〇〇〇元、內債爲民國二十五年統一公債。民國二十五年復興公債。民國十七年金融長期公債、惟外債之擔保爲關稅、內債之擔保爲關酴、關餘爲海關稅收除償付外債外、所餘之款、名爲關餘、</p>
<p>關餘不足　中行墊付</p>
<p>今財政部雖通告海關擔保各債務不再通融透支、關於國內公債之還本付息、由財政部命令總稅務司依照各債應付本息數目、按月撥交國債基金管理委員會保管償付到期本息、過去如關餘不足之時、均由財政部飭中央銀行墊付、聞財政部爲維持內債信用、决竭力設法務使照常還本付息、外傳行將停付木息之說不確、</p>
<p>通融上海　分期付款</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行、昨奉重慶總行命令、頒佈公債還本付息、改在重慶十足付給法幣、惟爲便利上海之持券人起見、准中央銀行上海分行及其委託之中國·交通·上海分行·中央信託局上海辦事處、代爲收取本息、惟因由渝匯滬之款受政府之嚴格限制、不得不分爲六期付給之、每期爲一個月分六個月付淸、至於應扣所得稅由第一期如數扣淸、零數由第六期付給之、</p>
<p>統一復興　領息辦法</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探得可靠上海付款辦法、（一）統一公債各種債券、票面最小爲十元、利息半年爲三角、應扣所得稅爲一分五厘、（依照四去五入辦法應爲二分）則凈得數爲二角二分、以六個月平均攤派則第一期至第五期各付四分、第六期則付八分、（二）復興公債票面最小爲一百元、利息牛年爲三元、扣所得稅爲一角九分、則凈得數爲二元八角五分、以六個月平均攤派、則第一期至第五期各付四角七分、第六期則付五角、</p>
<p>公債行市　漸趨穩定</p>
<p>上海之證券交易、自華商證券交易所停止開拍之後、該所七樓之現貨交易、不能認爲係正式之交易所、故其行市亦不能作爲正式價格、昨日交易上午一致高漲數角、下午回跌、尚稱穩定、昨日收盤、統一甲種五十六元、較前漲二角、乙種叫十九元二角、較前日跌三角、丙種四十八元四角、較前日跌四角、丁種昨日下午無交易、上午收盤爲四十八元四角、較前日漲四角、戊種四十八元一角較前日跌二角、</p>
<h3 id="c51">無錫四郊　遊擊工作　鄧部擴充至四千人　日僞肆擾梅村蕩口 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>新聲社云、據最近由無錫來滬者談無錫近况甚詳、錄之以爲旅滬無錫同鄕告、江蘇游擊司令鄧本殷軍長所部、係前年淞滬戰事時之粵軍、不及後退而留於錫地者、原有八百餘人、現已擴充至四千人、錫地除城區外、悉爲鄧部所控制、故錫地鄕間、依然靑天白日旗飄揚、目鄧軍長與士卒同甘苦、與民衆亦</p>
<p>打成一片</p>
<p>故當地僞組織、不敢向鄕區徵收田賦、亦即因此、去年十二月初旬、鄧軍長因黃埭黃文彩部隊、在后宅公然懸出僞省府綏靖隊暫編第四中隊隊旗、當即予以繳械、翌日大隊復來反攻、被鄧部圍剿、繳來步槍一百十七枝、盒砲及手槍十五校、輕機槍四挺、擊斃者六十三名、故該區綏靖隊、即全部解决、黃文彩亦不得不出走、鄧氏得此勝利後、乃將部隊</p>
<p>開往武進</p>
<p>約半月歸來、不幸於膠山前錫滬公路中發生遭遇戰、致鄧兀振梅劍峰隊長等、同時陣亡官兵共八人、是役也、鄧元振隊長、以少數兵士、抵抗兩小時、使大隊日兵、不敢再進而退、鄧部大隊、始得安然通過、可謂勇矣、鄧部受此犧牲、安鎮朱冰蝶又公然接受偽命、使其部下巫耀祖隊部、開至錫城訓練、鄧認爲膠山之役、朱冰蝶頗有嫌疑、値朱冰蝶將往梅村晤張學曾、鄧氏得悉後、即於半途</p>
<p>要而殺之</p>
<p>將其首級、傳往張涇橋一帶、號令示衆、但朱冰蝶部下、即於翌日開往梅村、大施搜索、以爲報復、致梅村鎭各商店、均受損失、未及避開者、悉被綁去、遭受非刑、梅村停市、達一星期之久、聞現已有日軍前往駐防、至無錫城區、有允國楨部隊常往襲擊、去年小除夕、南門外黃泥樹新昌絲廠會計日人某、坐包車出城、即被槍殺、元且光復鬥崗位日軍一名、被槍殺於城內、故現在不時</p>
<p>閉城戒嚴</p>
<p>城內綁架之風甚熾、已發生者不下數十起、稍有資財者、人人自危、前五日南門外大公橋堍、日軍二名又被殺、最近則九日南門外淸名橋僞稅卡午後五時、經過小船八艘、僞卡定欲其停船納稅、該船係某游擊隊運送之船、停下後、即由隊昌將僞收稅員五人、押入船中、開往南去、至今尚無消息、蕩口鎭駐有日軍、本月五日午後、突被</p>
<p>熊建東部</p>
<p>襲擊、槍殺日兵一名、生擒一名而去故至今該鎭密布防禦工事、並以新橋爲最重要據點。而置電網焉、新安鎭最近稍安、但日軍來修鐵路及電綫者、仍至鄕間騷擾、見有猪鷄及食物、强取而去、遇有婦女、依然有獸行、故鄉民一聞其聲、走避恐不及、最可惡者、有爲虎作倀者、引之走入各村莊、肆其暴行耳、張涇橋一帶、本係周振剛部隊駐防、但自在</p>
<p>顧山等處</p>
<p>與日軍抵抗後、即來日軍一中隊、故該處隊伍、均開往江陰邊境矣、南方泉淪陷時、極度繁榮、最後竟遭匪徒覬覦、遭受洗刦、今則完全由地方人士保衛、華大房莊地近蘇錫公路、自前月發生槍殺日軍兩名後、成爲互爭之地、日軍來時、游擊隊他往、去則游擊隊復來、聞隊畏爲顧正礎云、</p>

<p>本市鮮肉業因內地增稅後、猪價成本抬高、市價緣此增漲、日僞仿照魚市塲辦法、擬組鮮肉市塲、希圖壟斷營業現仍在進行中、因該業不予合作、恐短期內不易實現、鮮肉業同業公會密切注意其發展、並誥誡同業、不得參加、各情如决、</p>
<p>猪隻增稅</p>
<p>滬市鮮猪肉來源、均採自蘇北通州·如臯·靖江·等、其决爲鎭江·常州·無錫·等處、現日僞因經濟竭蹶、故極度搜括、所實行之搬出稅、在佔領區域一律推行、每頭鮮猪、增征苛稅一元以上、江北各口岸、亦將於日內開征、因此滬市肉價、為成本及運貨雜稅等加重、不得不酌予抬高、</p>
<p>壟斷企圖</p>
<p>日偽方面、擬壟斷滬市鮮肉業、特仿照偽魚市塲辦法、組織鮮肉業市塲、由日偽一手句辦、擬、擬建塲址於楊樹浦定海橋附近、其註冊手續及工程圖樣、均辦理妥善、現該業同業行莊、明知日僞詭計多端、均不願受彼輩利用、出資參加、雖經若干　客之勸說接洽、均嚴詞拒絕、同業公會切實誥誡各會員同業、不得參加、免貽後悔、</p>
<h3 id="c53">浦江輪渡有利可圖　日偽互相攘奪　偽「市府」辦對江渡限制輪拖　日商亦自相傾軋爭上周長渡 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>浦江交通、分長渡與短渡兩種、戰後因上下游各渡口、多數尚未開放、即已開放者、其營業權亦大半爲日商操縱、最近僞「公用局」亦攫奪民渡、希圖揷足營利、而日商與日商間、又發生競渡爭奪營業、故浦江渡業、完全陷於混亂狀熊中、茲將調查所得、併紀如下、</p>
<p>日商操縱　上高長渡</p>
<p>前上海市興業信托社、於戰前會辦有上海與吳淞間之長渡綫、兼靠浦東西渡·慶寗寺·（即高廟）東溝·高橋·叫處、戰後有若干新興外商輪渡公司、希圖爭奪此項長渡利權、但吳淞與西渡兩處、並未開放、故僅能行駛高廟·東溝·高橋·三綫、當時遂鹿者、計有福利·馬勒·長豐·惠通·上海·等五六家、結果上海輪渡公司、因係日商資本、獲得獨家營業權、操縱上高三綫長渡營業、其他各公司、均遭淘汰、所謂上海輪渡公司、即爲日商日淸輪船公司所辦、所用渡輪、則多爲戰後攫去之市渡輪漆改者、因渡資高昂、超過戰前一倍有奇、故獲利頗鉅、</p>
<p>偽組織竟　攫奪民渡</p>
<p>僞「市府」成立後、偽一市長傅筱庵、與偽「公用局長」趙光第、原圖依據戰前辦法、所有浦江長短輪渡、一律收歸僞辦、俾符合僞「市輪渡」名稱、曾向日方要求將上高三綫長渡、及其渡輪收回、詎交涉結果、傅趙要求、被完全拒絕、僞「市府未達目的、認爲與顏面有關、乃在九江路外灘與浦東其昌路間、招商合辦一對江渡綫、僅有短小之汽艇兩艘、稱之爲僞「市渡輪」、係六四拆賬辦法、因單程渡資一角、較戰前漲起四倍、（按前市辦對江輪渡、單程渡資僅銅元八枚）、故少人顧問、搭客寥寥無幾、難以獲利、最近見浦東南碼頭與南市南碼頭問商辦對江輪渡、營業興盛、頗能獲利、突於十五日起、亦派一汽艇、拖帶兩渡船、自稱爲「市輪渡」、攫奪民渡營業、而原有商辦渡業、反限制彼等祗許人力搖駛、不准輪拖、使其營業衰落、自動停頓、</p>
<p>兩日商爭　上周長渡</p>
<p>浦東周家渡南碼頭兩渡口、原由日商山下公司取得日軍南滙警備部隊准許開辦長渡、直達公共租界外灘九江路碼頭、前一渡口係銜接上南火車、後一渡口則係維持租界與南市交通、因赴南市者、可由外灘乘該項渡輪至浦東南碼頭、再乘對江渡至南市南碼頭、返時亦循此途、營業亦相當發達、但上海公司自以為有獨霸浦江渡　之權、故於去歲十一月五日、突派兩渡輪、開駛該兩長渡、並用勢力、將山下公司所有之兩南匯丸渡輪、迫令停駛、山下公司因此於兩個月內、虧累甚鉅、向日官方懇說之後、於最近起、亦派南匯丸渡輪、恢復營業、上海公司因營業不振、減派東　丸一輪、與南滙丸競渡、日商與日商間、鬧成爭奪渡業風潮，內幕不可究語、</p>

<p>大陸報云、日木各輪船公司將退還刻尚租用之外輪的四百艘一消息、昨日（十七日）傳出後、使全球航業界均爲之震驚、此大批船隻、均爲貨輪與各式輪船、其中屬諸英國者頗多、日本航運公司因「中國事變」異常需要輪船、故租賃此等船隻、當然需給外幣、通常</p>
<p>均爲金鎊</p>
<p>償付租費、日本輪船航行全球所得外幣、即用以償付租金、目下日圓之外匯價値的九辦士、在日本國內、則維持其一先令二辦士之虛價、日政府爲應對兩者間價値之差異、乃以若干補助金給予租賃外輪而航行之航運公司、因此等輪船</p>
<p>收入頗鉅</p>
<p>故日本各大航運公司經營外輪、獲利殊厚、但據傳日本新內閣決計遏止此種國家外滙款之外流、將來日本將全用日輪應付目前巨大之航運需要、直接受此新法令影響之兩大日本公司爲山下汽船會社與大阪汽船會社、昨據大阪汽船會社某人員云、該會社租賃而航行之</p>
<p>外輪極多</p>

<p>泊滬已三月、奥古斯泰號於上月間由滬駛馬尼刺後、顏氏之辦公處即設該快艦上、昨據負責方面消息、顏奈爾與考斯之揚子江之行、業已考慮若干時日、但關於此行之一切計劃，幾全守秘密而進行之、除顏氏之幕僚與美國總領事署少數人員以外、</p>
<p>無人知悉</p>
<p>此事、昨有訪考斯叩詢者、考氏承認將與顏奈爾前往揚子江一行、但對此事。不復作一語、僅稱此乃「小行」、並無政治上之重大關係、按照現定計劃、伊沙佩爾號將載兩氏至蕪湖、在南京將小作逗留星期五（二十日）晚、該艦可抵蕪湖、停泊一宵、次日駛滬、可望於屋期日返抵上海、此行一切計劃、雖</p>
<p>均守緘默</p>
<p>但顏·考·兩氏赴揚子江下游一行具有極大之關係、且美國於十二月三十日就日本對「門戶開放」之政策事、以强硬牒文致送東京、故其關係尤見重大、又美海軍運輸艦漢得遜號、載水兵約七百人、星期一（十六日）離滬返美、據得消息、昨晨該艦在上海與香港間遇</p>
<p>惡劣天氣</p>
<p>但本埠未悉其詳情、按漢得遜號係經馬尼刺·瓜姆·與火奴魯魯·而返美國、又豫料美驅逐艦阿爾登號與愛德華號、將於本月底以前駛抵上海，或將泊滬數星期、</p>

<h3 id="c74">上海之民刑訴訟程序 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 裔</p>
<p>上海的訴訟程序，雖是依照中國法律，因爲有協定的關係，稍稍與各省縣的訴訟程序，微有不同。就上海而論，有（一）江蘇上海地方法院（也有稱爲南市法院的）（二）江蘇上海第一特區地方法院（卽公共租界）（三）江蘇上海第二特區地方法院（卽法租界）以上三個地方法院，同屬於舊江蘇省區域之內，所以行政機關之上海市政府，雖直隸於中央，而司法區域仍然照舊，因此上海縣和上海市的南市閘北浦東凡舊屬於上海市警察機關所管轄的地方，都歸江蘇上海地方法院管轄，至於兩租界原各有會審公廨，民國十六年一月一日公共租界先行設立上海臨時法院，由江蘇省政府與上海領事團簽訂收回上海會審公廨暫行章程，試行三年，至民國十九年二月十七日由中華民國外交部與上海領事團簽訂「關於上海租界內中國法院之協定」，卽關於上海公共租界內設置地方法院高等法院分院之協定，並定四月一日爲協定施行之日。民國二十年七月二十八日中華民國外交部長與法國公使簽訂「關於上海法租界內設置中國法院之恊定」，從是月三十一日起實行。從此上海司法審判權，已完全歸屬於中華民國的法院了。不過刑事案件，除自訴外，仍由各該租界工部局警務機關起訴。（檢察官對於內亂罪等幾種罪名，亦得行使職務）司法警察仍利用捕房之巡捕，這也是爲事實上的關係。</p>
<p>因此，上海的訴訟形成三條路，一是在公共租界的案件，先訴於江蘇上海第一特區地方法院，上訴於江蘇高等法院第二分院，二是法租界的案件，先訴於江蘇上海第二特區地方法院，上訴於江蘇高等法院第三分院，至租界以外的案件，先訴於江蘇上海地方法院，上訴於江蘇高等法院，第三審上訴都屬於最高法院。自從八一三淞滬戰變突發，南市閘北浦東和上海縣區先後淪陷，江蘇上海地方法院，自然停頓，而設在蘇州之江蘇高等法院，也隨戰事而停頓，所以訴訟上可以進行的，祗有兩特區卽公共租界與法租界，復因最高法院遷至重慶，距滬較遠，上訴案件，深感不便，就在上海設置最高法院滬分院，以便中外訴訟人等。有人說上海租界毘連至近，地方高等法院，爲何不併而爲一，這有協定的關係，在領事裁判權尙未撤銷以前，這種制度，原是不易變更的。於此有一問題，卽越界築路的地方，馬路固是租界巡捕梭巡的，其路旁的房舍及土地，固仍非租界，特區法院其能管轄而一併辦理其訟案否？因爲越界築路，不是國家簽訂條的上的租界，旣非租界，在特區的法院，除當事人合意到特區內法院請求管轄，除法律上特別限制者外，予以受理外，當然不予受理，這是法律上的規定，司法機關無權擅爲變更的啊。總之司法爲一種國家極重大的權，訴訟爲救濟原權被侵害的方法，國權所在，就是司法權所在，上海兩租界之中國法院照常行使職務，也是中華民國國權存在之一證，中外居民，自共重視，其於訴訟程序，那可等閒視呢？</p>

<p>該船修竣</p>
<p>交給義泰、應至本年三月二十日一年租期屆滿、義泰接管該船、即以意商名義航行、更名萬納、上月五日、曹鴻儀偕閔南夏姓來云、義泰因拖欠閔南船租達七千元現擬將船轉租、俾可償還舊欠、當出示與漢口輪船公司所訂租的保單、及羅所付六千七百元之期票、上有公達航運公司陳德孚蓋章祖保、該票到期、必能兌得現款、曹允　兌到、以四千元償還閔南、並將該票</p>

<p>— 楊彥歧</p>
<p>當然沒有一個人沒有希望，也沒有一個不要自己的希望實現，可是很少人知道希望是世界上最空虛，最無用，最薄最輕的東西。牠是小孩子的面孔，是太平洋上的一葉扁舟，永遠不會被人們把握住，也永遠在玩弄著人們的心。所以，憧憬希望，是人們最愛做的事，也是人們做得最笨的事。</p>
<p>以前我聽人家說「別憂慮了，明天的光明就要來到。」這類話，好像心頭很舒服；對是對的，可是說錯了。天亮是天天有的，儘管「明天的光明」也的確是「就要來到」；可是一味期待，等到明天，依舊是一團黑暗，所亮的不過是早晨的太陽而已。</p>
<p>天亮不是跟著「明天」來的，是由人們一手造成，拿來放在未來的境地，讓牠在「明天」的衣裙下，一起走來。來了，當然歡迎；沒有來，就表示我們根本不配受到光明的照臨。</p>
<p>說起來希望，一掉頭，就看到回憶。</p>
<p>回憶也是人類的龐物，過去是甜蜜的，是的。過去是美麗的，又怎樣呢？反轉時代的巨輪嗎？拉回已逝的時間嗎？可惜人類沒有這種本事。</p>
<p>尤其在文章裏，感慨人人有，又何必老躭在夢中喊一聲「悲哀」，嘆幾句「去年今日……」？人是多情的，我承認，並且我也常常會滿肚子感慨。不過我不相信除了感慨之外，就沒有話可以說。我也常常寫回憶之說的東西，好像心頭所有的懷念越積越多，壓得實在太重，不能不出清一下。而其實呢，在腦子角落裏，正有許多值得說出來給別人聽的話。那不是牢騷，口號，人云亦云的順毛論調，風涼話，更不是抄抄這個抄抄那個的雜燴湯，而是自己的生活體驗，自己的見聞，自己領會到的知識。</p>
<p>至於想像，也可以說是幻想，卻不能說沒有價值。好的小說，好的戲劇，一定要在想像中洗煉過，才會美麗，才會染上文學的味道。</p>
<p>希望，人人都有；回憶，也是人人都有。但是因為人人都有，就不值錢。應該把腦筋從希望和回憶中逃出來，躲到腦殼外面，深入現實的境地，或者多加一些思慮，多想想，少做做夢。這樣，也許我們的文壇會清爽些，會明郎些，會實在些，會整齊些。更有一點值得盼望的，便是我們的文壇也許就此能夠少浪費一點墨水，節省一點紙張，而十足的反映出這個大時代。</p>
<p>當然，誰不願意抓住這個寫作史詩的好機會，讓血和肉交織成一幅圖畫，刻劃出今日的人間，永遠遺留在世界上呢？</p>
<h3 id="c105">在陌塢 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 胡之天</p>
<p>抗戰堅難地持續著，大時代中的小人物——貪生怕死的知識者，從開頭起，一直在小角落裏打著轉。</p>
<p>一年後的此刻，我想起一年前。</p>
<p>其時，螯居在臨危的家鄉，還掙不脫苦苦牽住衣襟的家人，面對著死的威脅，企圖清脫的茍活。像村夫村婦一樣的愚蠢，把深山野墺當作安全地，隨女佣走到她的山間的母家。</p>
<p>匆忙到不顧是急雨天，小划船橫進了多萍的小港，在滑濘的草地上登了岸，兩個婦人和我，張著雨傘走著。</p>
<p>從大塊的石板地走到細碎的石子路，兩邊襲來了籠罩在雨朦朧中的山丘。</p>
<p>雨打在樹上，溪水奔跑著，合著我們的腳步聲，山中沒有第四樣音響。</p>
<p>寂靜幾乎使人忘懷了來意，即使在潮濕的空氣中，也深深地呼吸一下，說：這樣的好地方啊！</p>
<p>要三四里之後才見到竹籬與柴籬，才見到愕然的雞犬與人。</p>
<p>——外面又在反亂了？怪道躲到裏面來的一天多似一天。</p>
<p>恰巧在離女佣的母家再轉幾個彎之後，越過一條溪，有三上三下新建的木屋。說新建也該在三五年前了，因為老嘉力的新媳婦已經抱著三四歲的孩子，但簷瓦簇新，粉牆黑白分明，又還有一間樓房是不曾鋪上樓板的，老嘉力在等候自己山上的樹長足和他跟他的兒子的空閒。老嘉力顫危危地說了五塊錢一月，定以為是獅子大開口了，他的老伴用眼色在埋怨他的貪吝，但是一見我一口就答應了他的要求，他們又悔喜交集。老嘉力的兒子在膝踝頭編著草鞋，露出疑懼的不很歡迎的臉色。</p>
<p>第三天，我們就正式進了這木屋，我一家和我的兄弟。我帶在身邊的是：李太白，陶潤明，我的兄弟則帶著鄭板橋全集。</p>
<p>由中古廟邊也有濁酒買，十個銅元有一壺，竹笋是更不值錢的東西，舉起杯和箸，再看窗外的山和山外的山，微笑是不勝悠閒的。</p>
<p>夜間，睡在地上，在睡與醒之間，分不清外面是竹葉聲，溪水聲，雨雪聲，偶爾遠處有著盜警，或不確的吏捉人，深夜的山村頓時失去静穆，女人們的臉上有著多餘的驚惶。</p>
<p>爬山是一件大樂事，身穿元色的棉襖袴，再繫一根粗布的汗巾，蓋上氈帽，到讓小樵子認出是偽裝的時候，自己才覺著還不是真正的山人。但翻山越嶺已無須懼怕了。為了吃一方肉和一條魚，也就走著七八里「野毛路」。</p>
<p>這樣的日子一直過到有一天，在山頂上和兄弟兩個看了敵人的飛機來，聽炸彈落在不遠的地方，從數不清到變成一片模糊，再看這些飛機飛去。不久有人從山外來說是炸蕭山。</p>
<p>回一次家，市鎮上人心惶惑著，有一個藉口就使我們得離開家，走向遙遠的後方。我們說：做隱士總不是事。</p>
<p>但兄弟至今又在這樣想：將來還是到陌塢去老死吧。</p>
<p>陌塢，便是這個山村的名字。</p>

<p>— 勻君</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>收在處陽說苑甲編裹的七峯遺編，最近纔有單行本可讀。書是七峯樵道人撰，書前有自序，於著者事跡並無所發明。全書雖有六十回，但每回僅有數百字，最短者祇有二百字，如第三回，最長的如十四，五三，五四幾回，也不過一千多字。這和通常章回長篇頗不同，而書中涉及的範圍頗為廣泛，但又缺少組織，看起來頗像雜記似的。據孫楷第中國通俗小說書目「補正」中說「與另一本文言記事之海角遺編同。」書中以常熟福山兩地反抗清人的薙髪和組織民軍的始末為主，間亦敘及南京弘光朝事跡（第一二兩回）和鄰縣蘇州江陰因同一事件所激起的民變（十五至十七，四十九諸回）遺編中所敘述的範圍頗廣，地域有都會，城市，鄉鎮，村莊，而人物也上至皇帝，親王，官僚，軍人以及漢奸大小走狗，市井無賴，記出混亂時各方的醜態，而記述較群的都是當時鄉間的情況，這大約是撰者所親歷的吧。</p>
<p>就全書論，寫得實在平平，雖找不出多大的缺點，但優點也一個找不到。除了乾燥無味的記事外，連對話都很少，從文藝的觀點說，更是什麼都談不到。然而這書是不能當作小說般看待，而是應當作為史料理解的，這樣，纔不會誤解牠，歷史的意義。如書內記清軍的搜刦子女玉帛，獸性的屠殺，都是寶貴的文獻。三十五回記陳汝揚慘烈說：「城破，家僮奔報。不能行走，夫妻惟對泣而已。被兵丁綁在陸貽吉家旗竿上。其妻則槍戳死於家中牀下，第三日，兵去後，里人見之，以刀斷其縛，而喉中尚有餘氣作聲。」這種絕滅人性的暴行，不論誰見了也會感憤的。然而有誰想到在二百餘年後的今日，還遭到比這更慘的待遇呢！</p>

<p>— 飛白</p>
<p>一晚上我跟疲倦戰鬥，讀完了辛克萊的「不准敵人通過」。這勸人的故事緊緊的擒住了我。</p>
<p>一個資產階級的知識青年，家庭裏的份子都是希特勒的黨徒，美國法西斯的領袖，而他自己卻像是海洋中的黃葉，飄蕩著，過著閒散的日子。自從了一個參加反對運軍火到西班牙的示威運動，而受了傷的社會主義者以後，他懷著一顆追求真理的心，研究著現實的問題：參加了一次工人的集會以後，他又認識了幾個無政府主義者，他開始驚訝這些工人們的淵博；參加了一次挺進會的集會，他卻對那些專事呌囂的法西斯黨徒們厭惡了。</p>
<p>為了集款援助西班牙的政府軍，工人們開了一個跳舞會，票資全做捐款，但卻遭了挺進隊的搗毀。他更憤慨了，他更清楚的認識了法西斯的猙獰的面目，了悟和平是不可分割的真理，美國與西班牙之間也是有著密切的聯繫呀！</p>
<p>於是他要做一次有趣的旅行——到西班牙去。集合了幾個同志，他們開始踏上征途，走向保衛和平保衛民主的堡壘，去乾反法西的偉業。到了西班牙隨著國際縱隊開到瑪德里前線，民團正開始退卻，而英勇的國際勇士們喊出了：「不准敵人通過。」敵人的確沒有通過。瑪德里安然無恙。</p>
<p>在幸克萊的筆尖下這故事被寫得有聲有色，真不愧是報告文學的傑作。</p>
<p>同時我們不免要感到一點慚愧，十八個月來我們有些什麼呢？簡直很少看到好的報告文學，大半是流水帳似的，缺乏藝術的描寫，沒有感人的力量，甚至沒有外國通訊員寫得動人。這決非抹煞之詞，而是有目共睹的，每次大戰之後，產生了什麼精彩的報告文學呢？我們看到的多是將領訪問記之類。自然我們並不否認這類訪問的重要性，但這地是不夠的，也決不會產生偉大的報告文學的。</p>
<p>切記的是報告文學不同於新聞記事，徜忽略了藝術的描寫，只是平鋪直敘的報告，那將永不會與文學發生因緣。自然首先第一對於報告的對象該有深刻的認識，抓住一鱗半爪就信筆直書，那也是不會成功的。</p>

<h3 id="c110">知足常樂歌 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>讀本刋木易君「談知足」一文，陡使我記憶起某籍載有「知足常樂」一歌，雖詞句俚俗，却不害意，且對於衣·食·住·行·四項，都論到的，而在這國難嚴重的今日，正彷彿是一服對症的良劑！更知提倡節儉，素稱美德，而前人早在呼號中了。不過，那個歌却含有些禪味，是吾爲方外人所作，則不可知，但是立意純正，値得把它紀錄出來，以勸勉服用奢侈的人們，歌如後：</p>
<p>舊衲衣，無價寶，縫而又補年年好，盈箱滿篋替人藏，何曾件件穿到老。（衣）</p>
<p>黃菜葉，用鹽炒，只要撑得肚皮飽，若因滋味妄貪求，須知俯仰增煩惱。（食）</p>
<p>茅舍屋，但高燥，蔽風避雨同佳妙，世間多少好樓臺，轉瞬瓦礫埋靑草。（住）</p>
<p>靑山美，碧水迢，雙脚淸健步逍遙，龍駒鳳輦本無謂，慈心隨處康莊道。（行）</p>
<h3 id="c111">咯血與飮食之禁忌 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 天健</p>
<p>飲食之道岯可不愼，有病者更宜注意之。余友殷君，年少貌美，但有咯血之疾，數年間時發時愈，醫生勸其禁忌刺激之飲食，以殷君喜飲酒，有劉伶之風也。去年因戰禍避居鄉間，沉悶之餘，以麴蘖遺憂，每飲必醉，在醉鄉中過其生活，竟忘醫生之囑。冬至節邊，忽大吐盈碗，人亦病倒，雖經醫治，體益大傷。春間萎頓尫瘠，無復人形，隨其戚携家輾轉來滬，僦居愚園路，咯血之病，依然猖獗，疊延醫生診治，無甚效果。乃有其戚介紹前往同孚路同孚村昌年國藥社購服四川肺癆草，因聞此藥草產於蜀省深山間，專治肺癆咯血，頗有奇效也。連服四五盒，咯血即稍止，乃服之二打以上，咯血果不復發，體亦漸復，貌亦漸腴。自以爲幸遇靈藥，得慶更生，然對於杯中物則視若毒物，不敢更近。由此可知咯血者絕對不能飲酒吸烟，當嚴守忌口之戒，吾則貪飲必喪生也，豈可忽乎？</p>

<p>— 王志韓</p>
<p>在都市中，關於行的方面，有電車，汽車，黃包車，你可以酌量你的消費力量而加以選擇。鄉村可不能比了，說也可憐，幾千年的大國，繁盛的江蘇，到現在交通仍然不能暢達；以致鄉村中行的工具，仍然恃着古老的獨輸小車。獨輪車在鄉村，是交通權威者，不亞於都市中的汽車。</p>
<p>凡事都有門檻，坐獨輪車當然不能例外，也有它的門檻。你在坐獨輸車之前，必得和車夫交涉，只走土路，不走石路，吾則，他會貪圖石路易走而省力，走一天路，也許要睡上一天。</p>
<p>你坐在車上，看見前面路途下陷成潭形那你必得下車步行跨過，免得車輪陷入，上下不得使你受窘而多費時間。如其遇着小橋，或不堅實的木橋，允必須自動下車，不必徵求車夫同意；因車夫多喜賣弄他的力氣大技術高你問他可要下車也許勸你坐在車上，不要驚恐，走到橋上，弄得不巧，會寫一個卜字或小字。（此是俗語，因爲橋影橫在水中，很像字體中的一竪，一個人掉下去，好似一竪旁邊添了一點，成卜字，兩個好似添了兩點，成小字。）</p>
<p>你要下車時，必得咨照車夫，倘使你驀然下車，車夫不曾防備，手勢一鬆，會跌你一個狗吃屎。</p>
<p>經過不能容兩車並行的狹路，而前面又來一車時，你須看來車和你的車子情形而定辦法，倘使你是一個人獨坐，而來車却坐着兩個人，或是老人婦人，你必得下車，讓他先走過。反之，他要讓你，如果你應讓而不讓，那末，兩輛車子，會和鬥的蟋蟀一樣，對立着相持，甚至來車破口大駡，經路人仲裁之後，大概敗訴的還是你。</p>
<p>春夏秋三季，經過鄉村打麥塲，你必得下車，使車子减輕重量，從容走過，不然，莊稼人會駡你，也許要將你的車子扣住，要求你賠償他的損失。因爲平坦的打麥塲，經重載的車輪碾過，會將泥土碾成一條深溝，麥子或穀子等撒進去，再也掃不出來，莊稼人便受到損失了。</p>

<p>— 馮秋萍</p>
<p>一九三九年編結界之新獻</p>
<p>用絨綫編結成旗袍還是創見吧？我相信女士們一定對之愈感興趣，而預備試結一件。在月前我會將絨綫旗袍的編結法在富星電台播音敎授，事後有很多听衆来信和来电话要求重講，本文便算是一個總答覆，並供給一般愛好編結的女士們作爲借鏡。一件絨綫旗袍的用料是一磅十四支粗絨綫，將來穿舊了，拆散之後，仍可編結其他衣物，這是非常合於經濟條件的。在開始編結的時候，應先注意旗袍的長度，絨綫須較普通的約短一寸，因爲絨綫是垂重的，穿</p>
<p>提要：长短及腰身，尺寸，最好照各人所穿之旗袍作標準，分前後身兩起結，鈕子鈕拔用鈎針鈎辨子，再用細銅絲穿進盤成各種花鈕。</p>
<p>材料：粗絨綫一磅十四支，細隔絲絨綫一支。</p>
<p>用具：間頭捧針一付，鈎針一隻，毛綫刺繡針一隻，細銅絲三根撳鈕八粒。</p>
<p>起首編法：用單頭針，起首，先做後身，針數為九十六針兩邊之迫及下擺，全結桂花針，兩邊是四針桂花針，下擺先編二行上下針，第三行，邊針挑去第二針同第三針相絞後結平針，此後多同，結完後，再開始結平針，兩旁之邊，則永遠為四針桂花針，結到九寸後，換針全結六寸長平針，在邊上，放出一針，再結二寸長，再放出一針，結有三寸再放出一針，結有一寸長。</p>
<p>收腰身，結有五行，二針併一針，兩端相同，再有結七行二針併一針結四行，二針併一針，隔五行，併一次共三次，不收不放結有十八行放掛肩，在邊上挑出一針，兩端相同，再隔六行放一針，再隔五行，放一針，共二次，後每隔一行，放一針，放至六次，再結邊即用桂花針結三行，存下，此端為左面（右面裏襟效法，）在中間一部，為後領先當存出二十二針，袖口結法與後身相同，邊亦結桂花針，裹襟結法，與放領圈相連，故在存出之二十二針，邊上先放一針在領圈間，每行放一針，共放十四針，裹襟放完，先結四行平針，在裏襟之襟邊，換結十針上下針，袖口結法與前相同，裏襟結有二寸長，在邊上先收去一針，每隔一行，收一針，共牧十次，在掛肩收法，大小方面，與後身相同，裏襟襟剩二十針，全結一針上，一針下，結有五寸半，用收口法收之即成，後半身已吿一段落。（未完）</p>

<p>伶人演劇助賑，自民十六各省大水災而後，始盛行於各地，前此而膾炙人口者，則當首推劉喜奎。民國四年，故都天氣嚴寒，貧苦婦孺，凍餒相望，政府思恢復粥廠，藉蘇窮黎，紳商乃繼起捐募，然所得甚微。喜奎乃分函各報，以演義務戲籌款自任，其函略謂「伶人自年前到京，在三慶園登台，至今不足二月，謬蒙各界歡迎，伶人感謝之至，刻因幾日無戲，閱報見有設立粥廠一舉，伶人惜之，偌大京城首都，仍有衆多貧民，愁思嘆惜！今伶人激發熱心，勸說同伴，並前後台老闆，商定自陰歷正月起，每月可盡粥廠義務三天，此三天內，除實在開銷用費，下餘之錢，全數助捐」云云，自是粥廠始有的款，遂克厥成。喜奎一女伶耳，乃有此然心之舉，求之當時，自是難能可貴，喜奎貌僅中姿，而眼波流動，神態飛揚，龍陽才子易實甫爲作劉喜奎歌，列舉古來美人如毛惜惜，邵飛飛·陳圓圓·關盼盼·蘇小小。李師師·趙閒閒·王保保等以比擬其色藝，甚至創爲劉敎，奉爲敎主，儼然執女伶界之牛耳，可以覘其號召力矣。而當時奉天某都統竟欲以三百金貿其溺，有某少年强與接吻而罰鍰五十，顚倒衆生，可謂空前絕後！然喜奎自下嫁崔某，即蟄居不出，崔某逝世後，益杜鬥謝客，淡衣素服，與二十年前幾判若兩人，較諸鮮靈芝輩下塲，徵以演劇助賑一舉，可以知其卓識固自高人一等也。</p>
<p>頃見某劇刊影印楊小樓演戰太平之戲單，係於故都第一舞臺演出者，當日戲碼有劉鴻昇之草橋關·王瑤卿之能仁寺·楊小樓與錢金福之蜡廟，許德義與王三黑之收關勝，名角如林，極烘雲托月之妙，初不若現時各劇塲之僅以一二名角爲號召者也。按當時故都劇塲狹小，座位迫隘，與海上各舞臺相較，直有霄壤之別，因此遊人率多裹足，第一舞臺之創，實欲彌此缺憾，而楊小摟輩主其事，鳩工庇才，經營累月，其形式之壯麗，結構之輝煌，頗有陵駕故都各劇塲之概。而搜羅名角，配置完全，尤其餘事。惟於開慕之日，即遭焚如，當時傳其起火原因，頗有疑及故都各院主之妒忌，以及事前正風育化會之干涉者，實則該臺肇此巨禍，因所裝電燈，工人安置電錢未妥，走電及於戲院門前之彩棚，遂登時火起，造成梨園未有之慘劇，楊小樓且坐是時萌出世之念，學禪作道裝，未始不因此刺激，某劇刊影印之戲單，當非此曇花一現之弟一舞臺也。</p>

<p>墨麗璧克馥一度亦是標準美人，現雖徐娘半老，但她對於美容術的造詣，自然仍是極高的。現在她開了一家化裝品公司，出了七種「曼麗璧克馥牌」的化裝品，公開發售。據說這七種東西，以前都是調製給她自己使甩的，現在特用克己價格，貢獻於一般愛美女士之前，保證滿意。這種最新化裝品不知上海還有沒有？</p>

<p>講到北平伶界的世家，當以梅譚兩家最爲整齊。因爲梅巧伶梅肯芬梅蘭芳這祖孫三輩全是唱旦角的；譚鑫培譚小培譚富英這祖孫三輩又全是唱老生的。同時這兩家又都是祖與孫的名氣大，中間的一代，似覺軟了一些。至於一家出了一個大王，恰父相同，這眞是冉巧沒有的了。此外像余叔岩暢小樓等雖也是伶界世家中有名的角色，但是叔岩的父親余紫雲是以旦角享名於當時　。小樓與乃父月樓固屬生行中俱曾享過大名的人物，可惜到小樓這一輩上，偏又絕了後嗣。其餘那些伶界的世家，不是聲望難與梅譚余楊四家相較，就是一輩强，一輩弱，很難能維持到兩世以上的盛名兒。所以不佞也不願多費筆墨，再爲舉例了。</p>
<p>不佞把譚家三世唱生的歷史叙過，下面的這段笑話也就引出來了。「打漁殺家」這齣戲，恐怕稍微通點劇學或是時常涉足劇塲的人們，全都曉得蕭恩父女打駡丁府大敎師的這回事。去大敎師的這個角，當然要以王長林傅小山他們師徒兩人最爲人所稱道，現在這二位全都故去，比較上技藝尚有足觀的，就要數老伶工慈瑞泉了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Ambassador Gu's Speech at the League of Nations Assembly: Demanding a Ban on Aviation Fuel Shipments to Japan, and Urging Member States to Boycott Aggressor Goods, Aiding China's Resistance is Upholding International Law and Order, Advocating for the League of Nations to Establish a Committee to Oversee the Matter <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Wellington Koo, Chinese Ambassador to France and Representative to the League of Nations, yesterday addressed an open meeting of the League of Nations Council, appealing to all countries to prohibit the shipment of airplanes and gasoline to Japan. He stated that Japanese planes are still engaged in devilish acts of destruction and that world opinion has failed to move the Japanese people. The Chinese government believes that only by banning the export of airplanes and gasoline to Japan can such destructive activities be stopped. The ambition of the Japanese is to first conquer Asia and then dominate the world. Some may regard this as a delusion, but the leaders of Japan believe that they were born to rule the world. China should unite with Japan, meaning that China would become a vassal state and Japanese troops would be permanently stationed in China. These are unreasonable conditions. China has always respected the Open Door Policy, while Japan seeks to turn China into its "private preserve." He then spoke of the war in China and the effectiveness of guerrilla tactics on the Japanese front lines, continuing that China still trusts the League of Nations. The suggestions of the League of Nations aim to create international peace and security. The League of Nations has become a fixed instrument for peaceful organization. Despite various failures in the past, the Chinese government still believes that the League of Nations can contribute to peace. Member states, especially the most responsible nations, are now prepared to give the League of Nations full support to eliminate war without resorting to war itself. President Roosevelt once said that it is now possible to apply pressure to aggressors without war, one of which is to boycott goods produced by aggressor countries. In the current situation, prohibiting the import of Japanese goods is sufficient to strike at the economic foundation of Japan in a short period of time. Eighty percent of Japan's raw silk production is sold to one country, and 45 percent of its woven fibers are normally sold in only three or four countries. Such a boycott has already been voluntarily initiated by the people of some countries, making it easy for governments to implement. As for airplanes and gasoline, they are even more important, and the League of Nations Council should advocate a ban on these two items. The Chinese government wishes the League of Nations Council to request member states, in addition to other matters, to expand financial and economic assistance to China, so that China can develop and transform its southwestern provinces, as well as assist refugees. Guaranteeing the convenience of transporting and transshipping military supplies purchased by China is also necessary for China to continue its vigorous resistance against Japan. In the past eighteen months, China has encountered various difficulties in making these transports and transshipments, and the government's war effort has suffered greatly. The Chinese government also requests the League of Nations Council to establish an adjustment committee, such as a general affairs committee. If it is not convenient to implement this plan at this time, the Chinese government would be happy to have a limited adjustment committee composed of representatives from countries with special relations with the Far East. No matter what action is taken, aiding China's resistance should not be seen as being solely for China's benefit, as this action is also conducive to maintaining all principles of international law and order. Moreover, the rights and interests enjoyed by countries directly related to the Far East will also be secured through this legitimate defense. Past experience has clearly shown that if the Chinese people are not allowed to make their own decisions about their future, it will be impossible to preserve the rights and interests of Western countries in China. If the Chinese people are allowed to exercise full administrative power in their own country, the Open Door in China will be maintained. The time for the League of Nations to take effective action to curb Japanese aggression has arrived, and in fact, it is long overdue. Countries with important land, commercial, and economic interests in the Far East have a duty to protect them. Japan has deliberately attacked their rights and interests in the past eighteen months, and its expansion of aggression has progressed simultaneously. These countries should be fully aware of what their future will be like. He concluded by saying that unless the countries concerned are prepared (but it has not been seen) to abandon their treaty rights and inherent interests in China, and to cede their rights and positions in East Asia and the Pacific, they must not miss the opportunity to take united or parallel action to curb the spread of Japanese aggression. Their taking of this resolute action is all benefit and no harm.</p>
<p>Regarding the report of the Mandates Commission on the Japanese-mandated islands, Dr. Koo issued a declaration to the League of Nations Council, stating that the Japanese government has implemented a total mobilization in the mandated islands in accordance with the General Mobilization Law promulgated in May 1938. This action violates the spirit of the mandate, so he has the right to raise this matter with the League of Nations Council upon obtaining a detailed report. The League of Nations replied that when this information is submitted to the Mandates Commission, they will express their views on the matter. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Koo also requested the cooperation of the United States in jointly sanctioning Japan, and in his speech, he repeatedly mentioned President Roosevelt and the attitude adopted by the United States, calling President Roosevelt "an outstanding leader of the great republic across the Atlantic." He also said that President Roosevelt, with his far-sighted vision and the tone of a great statesman, "opposes international aggression and hopes that the American people will support democracy and peace." Mr. Koo then quoted extensively from President Roosevelt's message to Congress. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Dr. Wellington Koo, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations Council meeting, delivered his speech today, the Chinese delegation drafted a proposal requesting the Council to urge member and non-member states of the League of Nations to take effective measures against Japan, such as boycotting Japanese goods and prohibiting the shipment of arms and military supplies to Japan, especially airplanes and gasoline. It also requested the Council to urge all countries to provide financial and economic assistance to China for the construction of the southwest and the relief of refugees. The proposal further requested the Council to organize a general committee or to organize a committee with countries particularly related to the Far East to implement these measures. According to the Chinese delegation's draft, it has been submitted to the Council this afternoon and is expected to be presented for discussion at a closed Council meeting first. Chinese representatives Wellington Koo, Tsien Tai, Chin Kin-fu, and Hu Shih-tse will meet separately with representatives of various countries on the Council tomorrow morning. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Britain and the United States Plan Extra-Council Actions: Avoiding Invoking Article 16 of the Covenant; France Has Followed Britain and the United States in Presenting Notes to Japan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) France today adopted the same attitude as Britain and the United States, presenting a note to Japan rejecting Japanese criticisms of the Nine-Power Treaty and the "Open Door" policy in China. The French note to Japan is almost identical in content to the protests previously made by Britain and the United States. This is the result of an agreement between the three major democracies to jointly take action to curb Japan's ambitions in the Far East. The French note sent today insists on maintaining French rights and interests in China and suggests that the only way to amend the Nine-Power Treaty is through international negotiations. It also states that Paris cannot recognize the unilateral solutions carried out in China by Japanese warlords through aggressive pressure. The French side will also protest against the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese military authorities on French rights and interests in China and is even more opposed to Japan's invasion of China. The note also cites recent statements made by senior Japanese officials as reasons for France's fear that its rights and interests in China will be permanently infringed upon by the Japanese. France's protest was sent to Tokyo after Britain and France and the United States took the same action last week. As for what joint action the democratic countries will take as the second step in sanctioning Japanese aggression if Japan fails to provide a satisfactory response to the three countries' protests, French officials today declined to comment. (Associated Press, 17th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The speech delivered by Wellington Koo, the chief Chinese representative to the League of Nations Council, has been commented on by League of Nations officials, who generally believe that Dr. Koo is trying to demand that member states impose financial and economic sanctions on Japan. This type of sanction was once imposed on Italy and failed, and it is feared that it may not be possible to implement it under the current circumstances. It is said that even Ambassador Koo himself can probably sense this. (Havas, 17th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The speech delivered by Dr. Wellington Koo, the Chinese Ambassador to France, at the League of Nations Council yesterday, has been commented on by the local newspapers. The right-wing Echo de Paris reports that "This speech is very moving, but the League of Nations is actually unable to intervene in the Far East situation at present and has no real power to assist China. The British and French representatives will likely respond to Ambassador Koo with sympathetic words, but they may not actually accept the matter. At the same time, the British government is following the United States and intends to impose some kind of retaliatory measure on Japan, but it may not initiate any collective action within the scope of the League of Nations. Once economic sanctions are used against Japan in the future, a statement will definitely be issued stating that this is a fact initiated by Britain and the United States and is not related to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant." The right-wing Le Jour reports that "What China is requesting is to impose sanctions on Japan. Although this initiative has aroused great interest, all parties advocate caution." The extreme right-wing L'Ami du Peuple reports that "If the plan proposed by Ambassador Koo is passed, it would be tantamount to deciding to implement sanctions against Japan, which the League of Nations Council may not be willing to do. It will once again find a way to evade responsibility. Economic sanctions should include banning the shipment of airplanes and kerosene to Japan. Even if it is considered sufficient to assist China, the Council must think again before taking such a risky move. Although the discussion of China's application has been postponed and is being considered for a long time, it will definitely respond with an extremely cautious and superficial resolution." The socialist Le Populaire reports that "Ambassador Koo has once again declared the responsibility of the League of Nations Council. Although we hope that it will arouse a sense of shame to some extent, we have no confidence. The League of Nations is so weak, how can it do anything?" (Havas, 18th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) State Department officials declined to comment on reports that Japan is willing to negotiate the principle of the Open Door in China with Britain and the United States. It is said that this proposal was transmitted by a news agency and has not been formally submitted. If Japan does make a formal proposal, the State Department will give it careful consideration. (Reuters, 18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, after the US government issued two notes to the Japanese government on December 31st of last year, news was recently released from Tokyo stating that the Japanese government will state in its reply that the country's basic policy is based on the following three principles: (1) Racial equality; (2) All existing economic groups, such as the British Empire group and the Pan-American group, must be completely abolished to achieve free trade; (3) Fair distribution of resources so that all countries can freely obtain supplies. If Britain and the United States can accept these principles, Japan may hold a meeting with those countries. When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, he declined to comment on this news. American political figures said that the US has never seriously considered holding an international conference on the Far East issue. The US government stated in two notes that it is prepared to consider all proposals based on justice and reason, meaning that all international issues should be resolved by the countries concerned through free negotiations in accordance with their rights and obligations. This claim has not changed, but the proposals that Japan intends to put forward may not be able to satisfy it. Taking the fair distribution of resources as an example, this is Japan's mantra to prove that the country should enjoy preferential rights in Chinese commerce, that's all. (Havas, 17th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The cabinet has approved a three-year plan to expand the productivity of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. This plan will begin in April of this year and last until April 1942, requiring an expenditure of 1.02 billion yen. (Reuters, 18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Aviation Committee will establish a large-scale Central Aviation Research Institute this year at a cost of 50 million yen, establish a 2,500-mile air route between Tokyo and the mandated territories, and establish a large number of training schools to increase the number of pilots and mechanics. Japan's extreme emphasis on aviation can be seen from this. Last year, the Japanese government adopted the recommendation of a special investigation committee to build the world's best aviation research institute. This work will begin this year and be completed in three years. Meticulous research will be conducted on wind tunnels, aircraft construction, and engine materials. In April of this year, the 2,500-mile air route from Tokyo along the equator to the mandated territories will begin, and Japan's air routes will be greatly increased as a result. At present, including those within China, Japan already has 8,000 miles of air routes. It is expected that there will be medium-sized airships flying back and forth every week. Japan will continue its work from last year, building large-scale training airfields in various places, which are expected to be completed next year. In addition, five flying schools will be established throughout the country, which are expected to be completed in 1942, requiring an expenditure of approximately 17 million yen.

<h3 id="e5">Hopes for the League of Nations Meeting <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The 104th regular session of the League of Nations Council, which began on the 16th in Geneva, has listed the complaint filed by the Chinese delegation regarding Japanese aggression as an important issue. Two days before the start of this meeting, the British government sent a note to the Japanese government, the content of which was identical to that presented by the United States to Japan on New Year's Eve of last year, resolutely refusing to recognize Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia" and denouncing Japan's ambitions under the Nine-Power Treaty. Following this, the French government also presented a similar note to Japan yesterday (the 17th). The initiation of these events happened to be around the time of this regular session of the League of Nations Council. Regardless of whether they are related to this meeting, the main pillars of the League of Nations, Britain and France, having followed the United States in adopting a tough stance towards Japan, then when discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute in this meeting, for the sake of peace, for the sake of justice, and for the sake of their own interests, they will presumably take a further step to lead the member states to decide on an effective response to Japan's aggressive atrocities.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the middle of the year before last, China has filed complaints regarding Japanese aggression at every League of Nations meeting, and the League of Nations has also expressed its views with justice. In December of the year before last, it passed a resolution on individual assistance to China by member states, and in October of last year, it resolved that member states should individually implement the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant. However, because member states only considered their own interests, especially Britain and France being unwilling to take active action, all resolutions have become mere formalities, and as a result, not only have sanctions against Japan not been implemented, but also the economic assistance that China urgently needs has not been actively promoted and realized. It was not until November of last year that a line of credit was obtained from Britain. The fact that Britain, France, and other countries have not been able to mobilize the League of Nations to actively provide assistance to China in the past is significantly related to the constraints of the tense situation in Europe; however, Britain's hope to preserve its rights in China under a policy of compromise is an even more important reason. Recently, Japan has no longer wanted to continue using Britain's policy of compromise and is carrying out work to eradicate European and American forces in China, wanting to destroy European and American commerce and investment in China and then attempt to abolish all the rights and interests of European and American personnel in China. Britain's past protests have been ineffective, and it is said that Japan will adopt the same attitude in responding to the recent tough note. This shows that protests on paper are always of no use and that actual action is needed. If Britain wants to preserve its rights and interests in the Far East, then at this time, it can only unite and mobilize the League of Nations to implement economic sanctions against Japan, which is enough to make the aggressor have some concerns. Moreover, Britain and its territories occupy a major position in economic sanctions against Japan. Japan's military supplies, except for a portion of arms coming from Britain itself, mostly obtain cotton from India, oil from Borneo, and wool from Australia; and a large portion of Japan's daily necessities are sold mainly in British colonies. Therefore, if Britain initiates economic sanctions against Japan, it is easy to do and will be particularly effective.</p>
<p>In the past, Britain, France, and other countries were often afraid that the United States would not be able to cooperate with the League of Nations, which would put them in a diplomatically isolated position. This is another reason why the League of Nations could not implement sanctions against Japan. In fact, the resolutions passed by the League of Nations in the past that member states have not yet implemented, such as the prohibition of arms exports to Japan and economic assistance to China, have recently been implemented first in the United States. So now the question is not whether the United States is not cooperating with the League of Nations, but whether the League of Nations is willing to cooperate with the United States. The United States Congress is currently discussing the Neutrality Act amendment and the economic sanctions against Japan bill, which correspond exactly to the past League of Nations resolutions to aid China. If the League of Nations promptly announces the implementation of the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant at this time, then after receiving spiritual encouragement from the League of Nations, the amendment of the US Neutrality Act and the economic sanctions against Japan bill will proceed very smoothly and can further increase the power of the League of Nations to sanction Japan.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' failure to find a practical solution to the Far East problem in the past has seriously damaged its credibility. This peace palace in Geneva not only has countries with fascist flavors of aggression know that it is useless and can be discarded like rubbish; even countries with deeply sympathetic justice and democratic governance feel that the League of Nations is ineffective and insufficient to protect world peace. Now it is not too late for the League of Nations to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost. For China's desperate complaint, it should implement that effective solution. The demands made by the chief Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, in the general assembly that are reported in today's newspaper, such as financial and economic restrictions on Japan, boycotting Japanese goods, prohibiting the transportation of war materials such as airplanes and gasoline to Japan, actively assisting China financially and economically, and providing convenience in exporting and transporting arms to China, are all references to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. This was already passed by the previous general assembly but not implemented by the member states. Now the League of Nations should quickly enable member states to fulfill their obligations under the Covenant and must change from individual assistance to China to collective assistance to China. In the current situation, since the United States has already implemented assistance to China, if the League of Nations can cooperate closely with the United States and use collective power to assist China economically and in terms of arms on the one hand, strengthening China's resistance power, and on the other hand, impose significant pressure on Japan's weak economy, it can give the aggressor the greatest blow and urge the early end of the Far East war. The credibility of the League of Nations can also be restored immediately, and world peace will truly have a collective security guarantee. This is nothing more than the League of Nations member countries fulfilling their due obligations, and China, for resisting violent aggression, will naturally be even more grateful and inspired to work harder to get just and fair assistance.</p>

In order to ease the soldiers' minds, the Japanese commander first transferred the entire regiment to the Xintanpu area in the last ten days of last month and formed the Ikeda detachment. Currently, aside from leaving a small infantry unit and a unit each of cavalry and artillery in the Ruoxi Hezhang Street area, the main force has moved east. They also plan to send a team to take over the defense of the division in February of this year. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Huang Weili formerly served at the Chinese Embassy in Berlin, Germany. In his spare time, he studied political economy at the University of Berlin and was very diligent in his studies. After the national crisis, the embassy work became more burdensome, but he was quite capable of enduring hardship. As a result, he fell ill. After taking the doctoral examination, his illness worsened. Furthermore, he was moved by national affairs, and although he returned to the country with a serious illness, the doctor said that there was no hope of a full recovery. On October 1st of last year, he committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. In his suicide note, he stated: "The country is in crisis. With my sick body, not only am I unable to do my best to save the country, but every day I live is a waste of the nation's financial and material resources. Therefore, it is better to die." He also earnestly instructed that the remaining 140 pounds, 12 shillings, and 10 pence be donated to the anti-Japanese fund. A talented scholar died young, and the situation is extremely pitiful. People in the diplomatic circles are all deeply saddened by it. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>(London) Professor Zhang Pengchun, a member of the Chinese National Political Council and former Vice President of Nankai University, who had just flown here from Chongqing, made a statement to the press last night, saying that China currently has 240 army divisions, each with 10,000 personnel, prepared to cope with the "second phase" of the war. At the same time, there are 30,000 military officers in training. "Our country originally adopted a defensive posture militarily in the first phase of the resistance war, that is, from July 1937 to August 1938. Now that the second phase of the resistance war has begun, its characteristic is that our army is prepared to take the offensive. Military authorities are holding meetings to discuss the issue of troop allocation. The excellent environment in Chongqing is unprecedented. We have the conviction to win and have made long-term resistance preparations in the southwestern provinces, and we have established arsenals in unexpected places to manufacture various weapons and hand grenades. At the same time, we have also established aircraft manufacturing plants. The casualty rate of our army and the enemy army was originally three to one of us, but now it has changed to one to three of the enemy. The enemy has one million soldiers, of which 300,000 to 400,000 must be stationed in the three northeastern provinces and cannot be transferred. What the Japanese army in China fears is whether it can return home safely. In short, China's resistance this time is not only resisting aggression, but also completing unification at the same time."

<p>(London) Mr. Niekesen, the chairman of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce, published a letter in the Times here on December 21 last year, detailing the situation of Japan's exclusion of foreign trade in China. Mr. Kawamura, president of the London Japanese Chamber of Commerce, also sent a letter to the newspaper today, refuting Mr. Niekesen's remarks, strenuously claiming that the Japanese authorities are making every effort to proceed carefully, so that foreigners in China will be inconvenienced as little as possible, such as the Japanese army's operations in Shanghai in 1937, which caused special obstacles, is one proof. Kawamura then mentioned the issue of navigation on the Yangtze River, saying that shallow water in winter hinders the work of removing water gates and clearing water mines. These obstacles must be completely cleared before navigation can be restored to avoid danger. As for Qingdao, Chinese people will sink more than twenty ships along the docks to prevent the Japanese navy from approaching. The Japanese side is currently clearing it to make all the docks available for use. Kawamura mentioned the exchange control in North China, saying that this is actually beneficial to British merchants, whose export proceeds can be fixed at eight and a half pence, while Japanese merchants must abide by the 14 pence exchange rate set by the new regime. Kawamura also tried his best to deny that Japan had the intention of eliminating the commercial power of Westerners in the Far East and advised the British not to be pessimistic.

<p>(Chongqing) Firstly, those who exaggerate the enemy's strength invariably talk about how sophisticated and ample the enemy's armaments are, how strong their fighting spirit is, and how well-prepared their finances and economy are. But what is the actual situation now? It is said that since the beginning of the war, the total number of enemy troops killed and wounded has reached 700,000. The number of enemy aircraft shot down and damaged by us, with verifiable records, is more than 600. There are also documents that show the actual number to be several times this figure. The number of naval vessels sunk and damaged by us is also close to 600. In addition, the loss of armored vehicles, tanks, artillery, mortars, light and heavy machine guns, and various other weapons is even more incalculable. With such huge losses, how can the enemy country sustain it permanently, considering its national strength? Not to mention anything else, we only need to see that after the enemy occupied Guangzhou and Wuhan, they have been unable to carry out large-scale military operations for the past two months. Although it is said that the enemy is replenishing and reorganizing, preparing for further aggressive warfare, their preparations are still not progressing, showing that their advance is faltering. All the troops fighting in China already feel extremely fatigued. Now, apart from forcibly occupying some of our communication hubs and transportation lines, the enemy is constantly subjected to the blows of our guerrilla warfare everywhere, and their military strength and resources are being consumed at every moment. As for their fighting spirit, it is even less vigorous than ours. Every time the enemy decides to attack, they must first bomb and destroy our positions with aircraft and artillery before daring to use infantry to attack. However, once the two sides make contact, the enemy becomes frightened and trembling, and soldiers who are weary of war are discovered everywhere, and even many commit suicide because of their war-weariness. Now, the replenishment of their domestic military strength has indeed become a major problem. Taking the enemy's finances as an example, according to statistics, the enemy's daily war expenditure exceeds 10 million Japanese yen, and more than 300 million yen per month. Since the war began in July of the year before last, the war expenditure has already reached more than 7 billion Japanese yen, and the country has been completely exhausted. Although there are many reasons for the recent reorganization of the enemy's cabinet, the lack of financial resources is certainly a major fatal blow. The enemy's military strength and resources have already been so weakened, so let's look at our situation in turn. The courage and strong fighting spirit of our soldiers on the northern and southern battlefields are much more enhanced than before. The preparation of armaments is also very sufficient, and replenishment does not pose any difficulties. Moreover, we still have vast resources in the southwest and northwest, which can be inexhaustible. The supply of troops is easier than for the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's strength is becoming more and more deficient, and our strength is becoming more and more enhanced. This is by no means empty talk, and there are gradually obvious facts to prove it. Secondly, speaking of diplomatic aspects, since the outbreak of the war, the psychology of a few nationals with weak confidence has inevitably harbored a kind of hope, hoping that our friendly nations would help our country to attack the enemy. In the year and a half since then, they felt that the help from various friendly nations was not enough, and a kind of doubt arose. We must know that the international situation is very complicated. It is not easy for any one country to immediately and independently use its strength to help our country. And our resistance against Japan must rely on ourselves to be strong. If we have a way, we will naturally get a lot of help. If we only want to rely on friendly nations, it is very dangerous. Fortunately, this war is fought by us to seek the freedom and equality of China, and it is fought to safeguard international justice and build a world peace order. This starting point is very clear to all countries in the world. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, we did not seek help from others, and the international community naturally expressed sympathy for us. All the voices of justice and a lot of moral and spiritual help were given. Now the international situation is gradually improving. The success of British and American loans is an important indication of the international community's full trust in our financial and economic and military strength. Moreover, the movement to boycott Japanese goods is surging all over the world, and the enemy's foreign trade figures are therefore decreasing day by day. All of these fully demonstrate the enemy's diplomatic isolation and helplessness. If the war is prolonged, our united strength will become more and more solid, and the enemy's international situation will become more isolated. Various friendly nations with deep-seated interests in our country have mostly realized that helping China is safeguarding justice, and is also equivalent to helping themselves. Therefore, there are gradually ways and actions. Who says that we cannot get considerable assistance in diplomacy? The above has explained that the enemy's strength is only so much, and our situation has improved in all aspects, whether in diplomacy, spirit, or material. Especially in the military, everything has entered a situation that is favorable to us. Politically, it has improved and improved a lot compared to before the war. Therefore, from any point of view, everything is full of good signs, and the future of the war is also very optimistic. Why do the extremely few people with weak will only value the enemy and look down on themselves? I am telling them today that at this time, we must have firm beliefs and first remove the psychology of doubt thoroughly. The national policy decided by the plenary session is originally (protracted war). As long as we clench our teeth, do not yield, are not afraid of sacrifice, and fight to the end, we will naturally become stronger and stronger as we fight. The victory or defeat of a war is determined in the last five minutes. The victory of these last five minutes requires our mental and spiritual perseverance to support it. I hope everyone will gather their courage and work together towards progress. (16th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Spanish Problem - French Chamber of Deputies Holds Major Debate - Flandin Advocates Recognizing the Nationalist Government - Blum Advocates Aiding the Republican Government <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) How France should act on the Spanish question was discussed in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon. Former Prime Minister Flandin, leader of the Centre-right Republican Union Party, and former Prime Minister Blum, leader of the Socialist Party, immediately engaged in a fierce debate. Flandin advocated strictly pursuing a policy of non-intervention and recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government. Blum, on the other hand, said that since Italy had already intervened in the Spanish civil strife, the UK and France could not but assist the Spanish Republican government. Flandin said: "The goal of the non-intervention policy is that France, at the end of the Spanish civil war, can announce to the Spanish people: 'Our hands are not stained with Spanish blood.' If France, in addition to pursuing a policy of non-intervention, can provide material assistance to the residents of both sides of the Spanish civil war on the basis of humanitarian considerations, it will surely win the sympathy of the people of the entire country. We cannot take the actions of other countries in intervening in the Spanish civil war as an excuse to commit the same error." At this point, Blum rose to speak amidst cheers from members of the left-wing parties, saying, "It is well known to all that I sympathize with the Spanish Republican government. I have never hesitated to say it. If the 'totalitarian countries' can avoid assisting the Spanish Nationalists, then France should also avoid assisting the Spanish government forces. What is the use of being hypocritical?" He also said, "All the promises France has made regarding non-intervention in the Spanish civil war have been faithfully fulfilled. The fact that the world regards Italy's assistance to the Nationalists as a matter of course is strange enough. It is even more astonishing to consider the withdrawal of troops sent by the treaty violator as beneficial to world peace. It is incomprehensible that we should continue to abide by the various treaty obligations listed in the non-intervention agreement when they have already been violated by other countries. At this point in time, the British and French governments have only two paths to follow: one is to abolish the non-intervention agreement, and the other is to follow the example of other signatory countries. I hope the Chamber of Deputies will make a choice." After Blum finished speaking, Flandin retorted again, saying that Blum's second cabinet had approved the shipment of military supplies to Spain. Since France had opened its borders, allowing people to supply one side of the Spanish civil war with armaments, other countries would naturally follow suit and supply the other side of the Spanish civil war. If this continues, France may have to send troops to Spain to assist in the war. In short, "Italy's position is certainly reprehensible, and any interference by other countries in the Spanish civil war is also a crime." At this point, members of the right-wing parties cheered Flandin, while members of the left-wing parties mostly responded with jeers. (17th Havas dispatch)</p>

"La Stampa," which has always been known for its moderation, also published an article today criticizing France, referring to the anti-Italian texts published in French newspapers, and stating, "If Italy wants to engage in propaganda to incite a pro-war mentality against France, it only needs to reprint the texts published in French newspapers, and that will be enough. The current situation was created by sacrificing our country's interests. The Italian people have already decided to use all means to force a correction. If France continues to turn a blind eye, it will inevitably cause uncontrollable anger in our country, awaken all old feuds, and even trigger a 'war that may be possible.'"

<p>(Chongqing) The Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15 regarding methods for repaying customs-guaranteed debts. At a reception for foreign journalists on the 18th, various questions were raised about the notice. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance gave the following answers: (1) The total principal amount of long-term debts guaranteed by customs duties, calculated at the statutory exchange rate, is equivalent to 250 million yuan in national currency. This includes the following three items: foreign currency loans account for 60 million yuan, the Boxer Indemnity accounts for 10 million yuan, and national currency loans account for 180 million yuan. (2) The amounts to be repaid monthly for the above items in "1939" are estimated as follows: 4 million yuan in national currency for foreign currency loans, 3 million yuan in national currency for the Boxer Indemnity, and 11 million yuan in national currency for national currency loans, for a total monthly payment of 18 million yuan in national currency. (3) The amounts to be paid to the UK and the US each month under the Boxer Indemnity are estimated as follows: £50,000 to the UK and US$160,000 to the US. The portion of these payments to the UK and the US each year can be paid off by "1946," but from "1941" to "1945," the monthly payment amount will be less than the current monthly amount. (4) The total amount of customs revenue in "1938" was 254,570,000 yuan in national currency, which is equivalent to an average monthly revenue of 22 million yuan in national currency. It is not known how much of this was collected by customs in the war zone, because since the past year, enemy seizures of customs duties have occurred at any time, resulting in inconsistent reports from various customs offices, so we have no way of knowing the exact amount. However, based on the current situation, four-fifths of the total customs revenue in the country should be collected by customs in the war zone. The customs duties of the northeastern provinces are not included, because since "September 18th," the customs duties of the northeastern provinces have been seized by the Japanese. Based on the customs revenue in "1936," the percentage of revenue collected by major customs districts is as follows: Shanghai accounted for 45.9%, Tianjin accounted for 10.9%, Hankou accounted for 7.3%, Qingdao accounted for 6.3%, and Guangzhou accounted for 3.4%. (5) Since the start of the war, the amount of customs revenue in the war zone seized by the Japanese by force is more than 150 million yuan in national currency. (6) The customs revenue seized by the Japanese and deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank is mostly national currency, with a portion being counterfeit currency, and there is also some Japanese currency. Most of the revenue in Shanghai is national currency, and counterfeit currency may account for more in Tianjin. (7) Question: Does the Ministry of Finance's notice on January 15 refer to all debts or only debts guaranteed by customs duties? Answer: The notice refers to debts guaranteed by customs duties. (8) Question: Does this notice apply to wartime bonds, such as national salvation bonds, national defense bonds, and other debts incurred after the outbreak of the war? Answer: The answer to the previous question has already made this clear. (9) Question: Since this notice refers to debts guaranteed by customs duties, is the Chinese government also considering changing the methods for handling other debts? Answer: This is another question, and it is not convenient to answer at this time. (10) Question: If various countries are willing to provisionally accept the repayment of the debt ratios from customs outside the war zone, will the Chinese government allocate funds accordingly? Answer: This question is a bit too much of a concern, and there is no need to answer it at this time. But one thing I hope everyone will pay attention to is that the Chinese government is extremely willing to do its best to repay all debts guaranteed by customs duties. The reason why it has no choice but to change the methods today is that the customs revenue in the war zone has been seized by the Japanese by force. If the Japanese can hand over the seized taxes to the Inspector General of Customs as before, then we can still fulfill our wishes. This intention was stated in advance in the Ministry of Finance's notice on January 15, that "In the future, for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs duties that were borrowed before the war and have not yet been repaid, the amount that should be allocated from the customs revenue outside the war zone will be allocated to the Central Bank on a pro rata basis for special storage. However, this method of pro rata storage is only a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the customs offices in the war zone hand over the stored arrears of the debt repayments and the amount of taxes that should be allocated in the future to the Inspector General of Customs as before, the government will still allocate the debt repayment funds at the same time to restore the old state." (11) Question: Will there be another method for handling the debts that have been temporarily suspended due to the January 15 notice after the war ends? Answer: This is very possible, but it seems that considerable negotiations are required beforehand. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to well-informed sources here, the National Government's temporary suspension of interest payments on foreign loans a few days ago will not have a significant impact on China's monetary system. These loans are mortgaged with customs duties. Currently, whether in Shanghai or in the interior, there are very few foreign currency investments. As for the reason why the Chinese government wants to temporarily suspend interest payments, it is to protect the interests of all parties. (18th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Chinese Air Force Assists in Battle in Guangdong; Japanese Army Builds Fortresses Near Guangzhou; Japanese Transport Ships in Provincial River Move to Humen <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the New Year, the Chinese Air Force's "Divine Eagle" squadron has been soaring through the skies, frequently appearing over the eastern Guangdong battlefield to assist the army in its counter-offensive against Guangzhou. The squadron takes off before dawn and returns to base after sunrise, having completed its missions. The people in the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River, looking up at the roaring iron wings, are all inspired. Porters transporting gasoline for the squadron on the roads passing through Xingning and Laolong are willing to carry loads voluntarily, each carrying 30 li per day without accepting any tea or water money. On the 7th, the squadron began flying over Guangzhou, Dongguan, and Humen, scattering leaflets urging residents who had not yet fled to evacuate within three days to avoid being harmed by their own bombs. On the 10th, just after dawn, they flew over Humen and Huangpu, dropping dozens of large bombs, sinking two Japanese transport ships and destroying more than twenty armed speedboats. The Japanese army panicked, shortened their defense lines, and established so-called "neutral zones for good civilians" between Dongguan and Bao'an, intending to use these areas as buffer zones. On the morning of the 12th, at about 7:00 a.m., the squadron sent another nineteen aircraft to control the skies over Guangzhou, preventing Japanese aircraft from taking off. They dropped more than twenty large bombs on Baiyun Airfield, circling for fifteen minutes before leaving leisurely. According to military sources, after Zhang Fakui inspected the northeastern Jiangqian front on the 6th, the Northern Route Army advanced on three fronts: Yu Bei, Guanghua, and Yuehan, while the Eastern Route Army advanced along the Guangzeng and Guangjiu roads. The Japanese Eastern Route Army guarding the Guangzeng Road, from Luogang Cave, through Longyandong, Wuchong, and Shipai, built strong artillery fortresses. The Japanese Northern Route Army guarded Taihe City, Sanyuanli, Yaotai, and Liuhua Bridge. The Japanese on the west side guarded the south bank and Rainbow Bridge, while those on the south side retreated to Longtian and Wufeng Village, encircling Guangzhou in a circle, focusing on inner defense operations. Within the suburbs of Guangzhou, locations with barbed wire and sandbags, such as Dongsha Road, Baizi Road, Xihua Road, Panfu Road, Changgeng Road, Dengfeng Road, Zhonghua Road, Shaqi, and Xicun Road, were all important strongholds prepared by the Japanese army for street fighting. They used reinforced concrete buildings as temporary fortresses, gathering various troops to form the core of the battle for Guangzhou. The Japanese also used Humen as a water and land supply station. Twenty transport ships that recently arrived in the Pearl River did not enter the Guangzhou riverfront but anchored in the waters of Hangbanzhou, Mazhou, and Dachan at the mouth of the Pearl River, where they unloaded Japanese soldiers who landed at Taiping in Humen and transferred them to Dongguan, Shilong, Shitan, Xintang, and other places for reinforcements. Currently, the Hua army's Chen Yaoshu brigade is still surrounding Shilong and Dongguan. The Shitan area is also controlled by the Hua army, but the Eastern Route has been in a stalemate for days. On the Northern Route, in Conghua, on the 12th, the Japanese army used balloons to direct the artillery on Da Gangling, shelling the Hua army positions in Conghua. Another two thousand or so infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops, from Taipingchang, Shangsankeng, and Dajiedun, launched fierce attacks on the Hua army positions in Daluodong. When Japanese aircraft were dispatched, the Hua Air Force also appeared in the sky, and both sides engaged in aerial combat. On the Western Route, on the afternoon of the 12th, the Japanese army secretly crossed the old Sanshui River from the river mouth, attempting to attack the Northern River Hua army positions by surprise, but they were met with a fierce counterattack by the Hua army. After two hours of fighting, the Japanese army was severely wounded and routed. After the 13th, the fighting on the Northeast routes became intense. The Chinese Air Force dispatched large formations every morning to assist in the battle, achieving victory before 8:00 a.m. The fighting was most intense at night, becoming static after sunrise.</p>
<p>Another report states that the newly appointed Commander of the Fourth War Zone, Zhang Fakui, recently convened a meeting of civil and military officials in Shaoguan, deciding to divide forces into three routes to counter-attack Guangzhou. Yu Hanmou was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Northern Route, with Li Zhenqiu as the front-line commander. Wu Qiwai was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, with Zhang Ruigui as the front-line commander. Xia Wei was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Western Route, with Cai Tingkai as the front-line commander. The deployments of the three major armies were largely finalized, with militia and guerrilla units acting as the vanguard, and the regular army stationed in the rear, advancing steadily. On the Xijiang front, the military strength was very strong. Bai Chongxi was in Wuzhou to support the Southern Route, while also taking care of the Guangdong-Guangxi border, as that area was related to the southwestern rear and was the direction in which the Japanese army was pointing.</p>
<h3 id="e32">The New Fourth Route Army: One Class of Soldiers' Life – Receiving Military and Political Guidance Daily; No Time to Think About Sexual Matters <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Continued correspondence from Belden, special correspondent for the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post: Soldiers in the New Fourth Route Army receive a monthly stipend of one yuan and fifty cents, which they usually use to buy toothpaste, towels, soap, and some very cheap cigarettes. From the commander down, every "comrade" receives one dime of silver daily to buy rice and five cents to buy vegetables. This money is not given to individuals but to the mess team that purchases food. The team publishes the accounts every five days. Most soldiers have one set of military uniforms, one blanket, and all other items, which they carry on their backs, including a rifle, bayonet, 150 rounds of ammunition, four hand grenades, a bowl, and other belongings, totaling 25 to 30 catties in weight, which is more than ten catties lighter than the loads carried by soldiers in other armies, allowing for quick movement. Soldiers who are at the front but not engaged in combat get up at 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. every morning, exercise, then eat. After the meal, they exercise for another two hours, then attend political training classes. In the afternoon, they mostly engage in sports. In the evening, they review their lessons, hold discussions, etc. Usually, a soldier's day can be divided into two parts: military guidance in the morning and political guidance in the afternoon. If a soldier fought the day before, he can get one or two days of rest and does not have to exercise or attend classes. Before fighting, soldiers must clean their guns, but the commander only tells them that they will be fighting at the last minute. Political workers are also combatants in the army, friends and companions of the soldiers, so they are deeply respected by the soldiers. Unlike youth organization members and speakers from the rear who tell soldiers to die for the country and Jesus, which is impractical. Soldiers in the New Fourth Route Army greatly admire courage. If a soldier is slightly hesitant during an offensive, the others will laugh at him. Soldiers are never afraid when they are about to fight because they have confidence in victory and feel that if they are going to fail in battle, the staff will not plan the battle. Of course, this only applies to guerrilla warfare; this conclusion cannot be drawn for positional warfare. When new recruits join the army, those experienced in the military often tell them about the brave deeds of the New Fourth Route Army soldiers, so that the new recruits can take them as examples. Soldiers who are captured are considered a great disgrace to the army. Occasionally, those who are captured and escape later have no face to return to the army. Occasionally, deserters return to the team. Although they are accepted, they are not allowed to fight but are assigned to other tasks, and their attitude is carefully monitored. After some time, they are allowed to fight again. If an officer is cowardly in battle, any soldier can kill the officer. If soldiers receive improper treatment from officers, they must report it to the political instructor, who will investigate and reprimand the officer. If soldiers feel that their clothing is too thin when standing guard at night, the political instructor will report it to the team leader, who often takes off his own coat and gives it to the soldier. Many soldiers wear coats captured from the Japanese army. Xiang Ying himself still wears the blue cotton clothes he wore in Jiangxi, so he has also changed to wearing a captured Japanese soldier's coat. Regarding the soldiers' sexual life, it is not as serious a problem as outsiders imagine. They are busy with training, fighting, and studying, so they have no time to think about it. Soldiers often fighting on the front lines rarely see women. When they do see them, they all stare, but the New Fourth Route Army often has women serving in the army, so they are not surprised by women. If a soldier rapes a woman, he will be executed without pardon. The New Fourth Army is extremely strict with discipline. Soldiers are very respectful to rural women, so farm families with wives and daughters not only continue to work as usual but also welcome them to interact. If a soldier is seduced by a woman, the soldier will be transferred to another place and severely punished. If men and women in the wartime service corps are fond of each other, but it does not interfere with their respective work, it is not interfered with. If it interferes with work, they will be separated, but there are no women in the New Fourth Route Army's combat units and front lines. One night, I talked to Xiang Ying about the issue of sex in the military. He said that outsiders cannot understand why there is no such problem in the military. First, because the soldiers are kept extremely busy and have no time to think about it; second, the soldiers' interests are turned to political aspects; third, Chinese customs make this problem less serious than among foreigners. Xiang Ying then smiled and said to me, "You also have sexual problems on the front lines." What the soldiers talk about is nothing but war. In their spare time, they also take walks and study. If a political instructor asks a soldier who is in love with a certain woman, he will tell him, "Comrade, it is useless to talk about love and marriage during wartime. If you get married, your wife may be raped by the Japanese army. Wait until the war is over."</p>
<h3 id="e33">Hua Army in Zhejiang Province Recovers Yuyao and Fuyang Counties One After Another; Fierce Battle is Currently Taking Place at Songmuchang; Changxing Has Also Been Recovered by the Hua Army <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Wuzhen Correspondence: The Hua army units led by Liu Huang and others departed from their base on the evening of the 9th to attack Fuyang. The Japanese army in the city responded in a panic. After holding out for twenty-four hours, the Hua army finally defeated the Japanese army and retook the county. The Japanese army retreated towards Hangzhou. The Hua army took advantage of the victory to advance and retook the towns along the highway. All Japanese troops along the line have also been cleared.</p>
<p>The county seat of Yuhang was recently retaken on the 15th by a combined force of Hua army units that surrounded and attacked it. The remaining Japanese army fled east along the highway towards Hangzhou. The Hua army, in addition to assigning a small number of troops to guard the city, continued to pursue along the highway with the majority of their soldiers. The Japanese army resisted again in the Gudang area but was severely defeated by the Hua army, abandoning their weapons and fleeing in panic. The Hua army then continued to recover Liuxia, Xixi, Shihuiqiao, and other important towns along the highway. It is also reported that the troops under Liu Huang and a certain division, as well as the soldiers of the Jiaxing militia, are engaged in fierce battles near Songmuchang on the outskirts of Hangzhou, hoping to capture Hangzhou.</p>
<p>According to reports, fierce battles have broken out between the Hua and Japanese armies in the four suburbs of Hangzhou in recent days. Clear gunshots and cannon fire could be heard in the city. Changxing, on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, was also retaken by the Hua army on the 12th after a day and night of counter-attack, clearing out the Japanese army in the city. The remaining Japanese army retreated towards Yixing but was ambushed en route by the Hua army near Zhangzhu and Hu　. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Hua Army in Tianchang Kills Japanese Commander; Japanese Army in Yangzhou Repeatedly Annihilated; Japanese Army in Liuhe Recalled to Puzhen <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops in Tianchang City is very small; the main force is now concentrated at Renheji. Xiong Yuzheng, the puppet "Pacification Commander" of Yangzhou, led a team of more than sixty men to Tianchang for reinforcements at the beginning of this month but was intercepted by the Hua army along the way and fled back in a panic. The Japanese army entrenched at Yangjiafentou on the northern outskirts of Tianchang was also attacked by the Hua army on the 4th, and dozens of them were annihilated. At the same time, Qian's guerrilla unit attacked Hushengqiao near Yangcun and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated. Soon after, dozens of Japanese soldiers in three trucks came to the Yangcun area, searched residents, and engaged in arson and killing. They stayed for three hours before fleeing, destroying Hushengqiao before leaving to prevent the Hua army from attacking.</p>
<p>Major Oguma, the commander of the Japanese army invading Tianchang, was recently killed by the Hua army. Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, immediately led Japanese reinforcements but was defeated. Ogawa was quite frustrated and is currently staying at Xishan. His remaining subordinates are in a miserable state. The Japanese army entrenched at Dayi, Quanshan, and Gongdaoqiao are now rushing to build defensive fortifications. The Japanese army besieged in Tianchang City numbers only a hundred or so. The Japanese army in Yangzhou recently dispatched more than ten cars to Tianchang, transporting a large number of military supplies back to Yangzhou, seemingly preparing to withdraw.</p>
<p>The Ogawa unit of the Japanese Marines in Puzhen, numbering over three hundred, previously invaded Liuhe but was repeatedly intercepted. The Japanese army deemed it not worth the losses. Now, because the remaining Japanese army in Puzhen has been transferred elsewhere and the rear defense is weak, they have transferred about two hundred of the Japanese troops occupying Liuhe back to Puzhen. Therefore, there are less than a hundred Japanese troops staying in Liuhe. They are now in a state of panic. Hua army guerrillas are all over the suburbs. The Japanese army is forcing the people in the suburbs of Liuhe to build fortifications to prevent guerrilla attacks. Fierce fighting is still taking place in the near suburbs of Liuhe.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Native Products of Ningbo Accumulate; Trade Committee Approves Shipment to Shanghai; Over 210,000 Pieces Reported for Customs Clearance and Transshipment <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Since the sea route between Shanghai and Ningbo was cut off, transportation was obstructed. There are currently more than 207,700 pieces of native products reported for customs clearance and awaiting export that are accumulated in Ningbo Port. They cannot be shipped out, and the financial collapse is greatly affecting the people's livelihood. The Yin County Customs Brokers Association, Trade Committee, Ning Shao Cotton Marketing Office, Paper Marketing Office, and others have successively petitioned the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters and specially reported to the Commander-in-Chief of the 　th Army Group, requesting the dispatch of ships to transport goods to Shanghai. The Headquarters has now replied, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Yin County Customs Brokers Association received a telegram from the Headquarters yesterday, ordering that all goods be reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Materials Adjustment Office for review and receipt of a certificate, and then submitted to the Headquarters for verification. Upon receiving the order, the association sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and a special letter to the postal office of the Materials Adjustment Office in Yin County, requesting a prompt review and issuance of certificates so that they could be forwarded to the Headquarters.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Branch of the Trade Committee of the Ministry of Finance previously had 22,056 boxes of boxed tea and 5,076 pieces of crude tea that were planned to be shipped to Shanghai. After submitting a request to the Commander-in-Chief of the 　th Army Group for approval, the committee has now hired the Moufu Wheel to be loaded and exported in three shipments and has reported to the Headquarters for verification. The Headquarters has ordered the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters to inform the Yin County Shipping Association.</p>
<p>The Ning Shao Cotton Marketing Office stated that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the cotton and agricultural industries urgently need funds. The amount of cotton stored in Ningbo is huge. The previous Kaibo Wheel approved by the Headquarters was insufficient for shipping. The marketing office requested the Commander-in-Chief of the 　th Army Group to hire the Ende Wheel of the Chinese-Italian Company to expedite shipping for relief. The Headquarters has approved the registration of the Ende Wheel, and the marketing office is allowed to hire more for cotton shipping.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters previously received a report from the Ning Shao Paper Marketing Office stating that it had more than 100,000 pieces of paper stored and planned to hire the British-owned Yongfu Wheel for four shipments for export. After forwarding the report to the Commander-in-Chief of the Headquarters for approval, four shipments to Shanghai have been approved, and the Yongfu Wheel has been registered.</p>
<p>Shanghai Fusheng Ningzhuang has 5,700 bales of cotton stored in Ningbo and has negotiated with the British-owned Weishi Company to have the company's Xixiangtai Wheel load and ship them all to Shanghai within ten days. The Group Army Headquarters has issued an order to the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters for approval.</p>

<p>Shangyu Correspondence: Baiguan Town in Shangyu, Eastern Zhejiang, is an important route to and from Shanghai and Hangzhou. Since Shanghai and Hangzhou were successively occupied, people from all over who had come to seek refuge came in an endless stream. Wang Qingsheng, a philanthropist from the town, has devised methods to take them in and provide relief. He has also founded a women's mat weaving and cloth weaving craft cooperative to enable them to work to maintain their lives. The cooperative has been in operation for less than a year and has achieved remarkable results. Now, in order to increase wartime production and settle unemployed refugees, Wang plans to expand the cooperative. He has requested assistance or donations for the fund from charitable organizations and gentry in Shanghai, and has issued a notice. The collection points for donations are the Tongrun, Zikang, and Baofeng Three Major Banks.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Puppet Education Policy of the Nanjing Puppet Organization; Publishing Journals, Printing Textbooks, Training Teachers, and Preparing to Establish a University <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing Correspondence) After the establishment of the puppet government, the puppet "Minister of Education," Gu Cheng, believed that the puppet "various ministries of the Executive Yuan" were all working hard to cultivate enslaved talents, such as the puppet "Ministry of Internal Affairs" establishing translators and training institutes, and the police academy. The puppet "Ministry of Finance" established accountant training classes, and the puppet "Pacification Ministry" established military officer schools. The puppet "Ministry of Education" did not want to be left out, so it promoted the following kinds of puppet education policies:</p>
<p>Publishing Journals</p>
<p>In order to promote enslaved thought, implement "Sino-Japanese Friendship," and numb the general youth, the puppet Ministry of Education specially publishes a kind of "Oriental Culture Monthly," and the puppet "Minister" Gu Cheng appointed Qiu Yulin, Wang Yinian, Wang Yue, Wu Beijiang, Qiu Ruji, Zhang Sukang, Tao Taiji, Zhao Ruheng, Zai Yongkui, Zhu Xuejun, Lin Lingxi, Xue Bangmai, Cui Jiancai, Lian Xiangchen, and other fourteen people as special editors. The first issue is scheduled to be published in January of this year.</p>
<p>Establishing a Printing House</p>
<p>There are many textbooks and printed materials from puppet organizations in various places that need to be printed, so the "Huazhong Printing Bureau" has been established. The total capital is determined to be 3 million yuan, jointly operated by the government and merchants. Shen Nengyi has been appointed as the chairman of the board, Imai Haruji, Suzuki Tasaburo, and Makino Kenosuke as executive directors, Xiao Jin and others as directors, and Shen Shu'ao and others as consultants. The founding meeting was held in mid-December of last year.</p>
<p>Training Teachers</p>
<p>The puppet side believes that the current general primary school teachers are not enslaved cadres created by their own hands, and recognizes the necessity of training teachers. They have specially submitted to the puppet "Executive Yuan" for approval to open "Temporary Teacher Training Institutes." The location is at Zhuqiao Primary School on Zhujiang Road in Nanjing. In January of this year, they will first train primary school teachers, setting up undergraduate and special courses. The undergraduate course is scheduled to graduate in six months, and the special course in three months. All students will be recommended by each province and city, with 20 to 40 students each. The qualifications for application are a high school diploma or equivalent for the undergraduate course, and a normal school diploma or experience as a primary school teacher for the special course. The puppet side knows very well that the youth in various places cannot be happily used by them, so they specially use money as bait. In addition to providing food and clothing, they also give 15 yuan per month for the undergraduate course and 10 yuan for the special course as pocket money. The enslaved students who come to Ning to receive training are mostly junior high school graduates with low academic qualifications and primary school teachers who have been lagging behind in the education field.</p>
<p>Preparing to Establish a University</p>
<p>The puppet side plans to thoroughly implement a consistent system of enslaved education. In addition to establishing primary and secondary schools in various places, it has recently begun to prepare for the establishment of a university to serve as a major base for cultivating enslaved talents. The puppet "Minister of Education," Gu Cheng, concurrently serves as the president. He is currently actively working on it. It is expected that the treatment of this kind of enslaved university student will be even better than that of the Temporary Teacher Training Institute. The school was initially named "Zhonghua University," but later changed to "National Nanjing University." The location is at the original site of Central University.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Exhibition of Liu Haisu's Recent Works Attracts Large Crowds <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the exhibition of Liu Haisu's recent works has been open for four days and is highly valued by both Chinese and foreign figures. More than 4,000 people have visited the exhibition in recent days, and hundreds of young students have visited the exhibition every day to study it. The first, second, third, and fourth rooms all display traditional Chinese paintings, landscapes, animals, birds, and flowers. The hand scrolls in the third room are also masterpieces of Liu. The objects he paints are mostly mountains, seas, waves, waterfalls, old pines, dead trees, and cold forests. As for birds, most of them are roc. In several cold forest paintings, the old trunks and dead branches of the trees appear to be alive and full of energy, as if they are enduring the severe cold and surviving, without losing their greatness. The fifth room has more than 20 large-scale oil paintings, which are also Liu's masterpieces of the past year. The strength of the brushstrokes and the intensity of the colors are all expressions of power. The oil painting titled "October 28, 1937" depicts the scene of the Eight Hundred Heroes defending the Sihang Warehouse. The tragicness of the overall color and the seriousness and composure of the technique are beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>

<h3 id="e40">School News <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Zhizhong Girls' Middle School, located at No. 186 Nanyang Road, enjoys a well-established reputation with dedicated instruction. As a result, enrollment has been very enthusiastic since admissions began. The first examination period is scheduled for January 30th. In addition to the original teaching staff, the school has newly hired Yang Changye, formerly a history and geography instructor at the Provincial Changzhou Middle School, to teach high school history and geography, and Gu Sui, the former director of studies at the Liangcai Preparatory School, to teach mathematics. Former teachers such as Ms. Qu Lunke, a Western teacher, and Cao Zhongxin, have all returned to their positions. Students staying at the school during the winter break are initiating preparations for a welcome party.</p>
<p>Daozhong Girls' Middle School: The Daozhong Girls' Middle and Primary School and Kindergarten, located at the intersection of Avenue Road and Datong Road, has over 1,000 students. A total of 104 students from various departments are graduating this term.

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3 id="e41">Chengzhong Middle and Primary School <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Chengzhong Middle and Primary School was founded by Mr. Ye Chengzhong and his son from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, who invested in its establishment. It has been in operation for 38 years. The school was originally located on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, covering more than 20 acres, with lush flowers and trees, and spacious buildings. A giant clock tower stands majestically in the middle. Libraries and gyms are readily available. In Shanghai, it is arguably the private school with the most stable funding and complete facilities. It has historically offered teacher training courses, commercial courses, old-system middle school, senior and junior high school, and complete primary school programs. Thousands of graduates have passed through its doors, and it has repeatedly received commendations from the education authorities. In recent years, the test scores of graduates have been particularly outstanding. During the August 13th Incident last year, the school was unfortunately located in the war zone. All classrooms, desks, chairs, books, instruments, and more than 30 years of savings were difficult to move out in a hurry. Four-fifths of the school buildings and school property (city properties) were destroyed by fire, resulting in a loss of hundreds of thousands of gold dollars. To continue the school's life and maintain students' studies, classes were started on September 27th of that year at the New China Middle School on Qi Haiwei Road. In January of this year, the school gradually expanded and rented the entire second and third floors of the Tongyi Building on Beijing Road as temporary school buildings. Currently, there are seven grades of junior high school and twelve grades of primary school, with a total of 900 students. Although the school buildings and facilities cannot be compared to what they used to be due to environmental reasons, the curriculum and training follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education. In addition to gradually adding books and setting up a student reading room, and purchasing natural science equipment for teaching purposes, a large auditorium (about two or three times the size of a normal classroom) has been opened for group talks and sports activities. In the midst of impossible circumstances, the school still strives to pay attention to the students' physical and mental training. Recently, the school held sports performances, current affairs tests, speech competitions, and mathematics scholarship competitions. Prizes were awarded to the winners to encourage them. In summary, although the school suffered great material losses, it maintained its unique spirit. The school's finances are absolutely transparent, and the organizers and teachers are determined to work hard without any slackening. The students are also energetic and have enthusiastically raised more than a thousand dollars for winter clothes and donations. Because the temporary school building is ultimately too simple and unsuitable for use, the school is adding the entire third floor of the Tongyuan Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Henan Road as a second department to expand classrooms and increase teaching time for all grades of primary and secondary school. Student dormitories will also be added. In the next semester, the school plans to find a suitable location outside of the Hongkou school, to lay the foundation for a second base.</p>
<h3 id="e42">New Experiments in Wartime Education in Hubei (2) <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jian</p>
<p>The great achievement of general moral education, military and scout training and management are also advanced at the same time. Military training is implemented from the third grade of junior high school. Other administrative organizations are the same as general schools. Academic and moral education affairs are also divided into three groups, each with a group leader. The president of the joint school is the chairman of the provincial government, and the director of education serves concurrently as the vice president, and assumes responsibility for practical administration while adhering to the president's execution of school affairs. The heads of each branch school are called directors, which is actually equivalent to a principal. There is also a school headquarters as a hub for transmission and impetus. For the purpose of implementing teaching and guidance affairs, two groups of teaching and guidance affairs are set up within, each with a group leader and several staff members, each responsible for their own responsibilities. Because the teaching and guidance group includes moral education, the work is particularly busy, and a deputy group leader is added, the same as when Jiangsu vigorously implemented the integration of moral education and teaching system in the past. The duties of the school headquarters are mainly focused on the centralized design, experimentation, or procurement of new businesses, new systems, and new equipment, and are only in a guiding and assessment position.</p>
<p>(4) Selection of Branch School Directors: In late July of this year, this province began to hold summer training classes for teachers and staff of secondary schools, affiliated to the Central Training Corps, held at Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain in Wuchang. All teachers and staff of public and private secondary schools in the province, except for a few elderly or sick people, were required to attend the training classes, and were strictly subjected to military life training, and carried out labor services and social services. At the same time, many advanced figures, celebrities, and scholars of the party and the country were invited to give lectures for a month. After the expiration of the period, they graduated. The directors of each branch school were selected from among this group of graduate members. The selection procedures included individual interviews, small group meetings, and interviews and inquiries by the chairman of the provincial government. Reference was also made to the training performance and military training level of each member, so youthfulness, physical strength, and health also became conditions for the selection of directors.</p>
<p>(5) Appointment of Teachers and Staff of Branch Schools: The decision on teachers and staff of each branch school is made by the branch school submitting a list of proposed appointments to the Department of Education. After approval and instructions from the department, the personnel are first notified to report to the school for duty, and then appointed by the joint school headquarters. The standards are divided into five items: 1. Have participated in the summer training class and received military training; 2. Meet the teacher qualifications stipulated in the secondary school regulations; 3. Have passed the inspection by the Department of Education; 4. Have not been punished or warned by the Department of Education after inspection reports by supervisors during the teaching period; 5. Have excellent teaching performance. If it is necessary to add teachers who have asked for leave and did not participate in the Luojia Mountain training class, the provisions of item 5 above shall apply, plus the words "acting". Their treatment is equal among the branch schools, and is generally a little worse than the former provincial schools. However, their responsibilities for teaching and moral education are greatly increased. This is the inevitable result of teachers and staff serving the country during the Anti-Japanese War. In 1808, the German Fichte did not hesitate to work hard, was not afraid of violence, and gave patriotic speeches to the German people in Berlin, and was able to awaken the people to participate in the war of resistance and jointly strive for final victory. We hope that the teachers and staff of the joint school will have this spirit and achievement.</p>
<p>(6) Establishment of the School Affairs Committee: The members of this committee are the president, vice president, one secretary of the Department of Education, the heads of the first and second sections, the secretary of the school headquarters, and the directors of each branch school as ex officio members, and former principals of provincial, municipal, and private secondary schools and people who have achieved success in running schools in this province are selected as appointed members. The School Affairs Committee is a meeting institution, and its powers are stipulated as: 1. Liaison of the administration of each branch school; 2. Reporting of the administration of each branch school; 3. Discussion of the curriculum; 4. Formulation of moral education regulations; 5. Review of expenses; 6. Planning of construction and equipment; 7. Planning for the development of school affairs. It is held at least once every semester, chaired by the president or vice president. During the adjournment, each member can hold teaching or other positions in each branch school, and does not have to live on campus all the time. The headquarters can send suggestions for improving school affairs to the president or vice president for adoption. This is also a precedent in national schools, and it is also somewhat different from the school affairs committee of national middle schools. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Payment of Principal and Interest on Public Debt Changed to Chongqing Installment Payments Available in Shanghai Six Installments, One Month Each, To Facilitate Bondholders Ministry of Finance Decides to Maintain Domestic Debt Credit <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain debt credit, the Ministry of Finance continues to hold lotteries for the repayment of domestic public debt. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank received a notice from its headquarters yesterday regarding the Shanghai installment payment accommodation measures for the Unification and Reconstruction Public Bonds. However, matters related to the repayment of principal and interest on public debt will be handled by the Chongqing headquarters and its entrusted Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Trust Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Unification and Other Bonds Are All Customs Duties</p>
<p>Foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties are the Good Posture Loan for Settlement, the Continued Loans from the UK and Germany, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund, and the Sassoon Huaihe Loan, totaling GBP 24,611,367, as well as the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Fund and the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Fund, totaling USD 225,546,000. Domestic debts are the 1936 Unification Public Bond, the 1936 Reconstruction Public Bond, and the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Bond. The guarantee for foreign debts is customs duties, and the guarantee for domestic debts is also customs duties. The surplus after customs tax revenues are used to repay foreign debts is called customs surplus.</p>
<p>Central Bank Pays if Customs Surplus is Insufficient</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Finance has announced that the various debts guaranteed by customs will no longer be accommodated with overdrafts, regarding the repayment of principal and interest on domestic public debt, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the General Customs Office to allocate the amount of principal and interest payable for each debt on a monthly basis to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for safekeeping and repayment of principal and interest upon maturity. In the past, if the customs surplus was insufficient, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Bank to pay. It is said that the Ministry of Finance is determined to maintain domestic debt credit and will do its best to ensure that principal and interest are repaid as usual. The rumor that payments of principal and interest will be suspended is untrue.</p>
<p>Accommodation in Shanghai Installment Payments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank received an order from its Chongqing headquarters yesterday to announce that the repayment of principal and interest on public debt will be changed to full payment in legal tender in Chongqing. However, in order to facilitate bondholders in Shanghai, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank and its entrusted Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai office of the Central Trust Bureau, are allowed to collect the principal and interest on their behalf. However, due to the strict restrictions imposed by the government on funds remitted from Chongqing to Shanghai, it is necessary to pay in six installments, one month for each installment, and to pay off the amount in six months. As for the income tax that should be deducted, it will be deducted in full in the first installment, and the odd amount will be paid in the sixth installment.</p>
<p>Unified Reconstruction Method of Receiving Interest</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from New Voice learned from relevant parties a reliable Shanghai payment method: (1) The face value of various bonds of the Unified Public Bond is a minimum of 10 yuan, and the interest for half a year is 3 jiao. The income tax to be deducted is 1 fen and 5 li (according to the rounding method of four to five, it should be 2 fen), so the net amount is 2 jiao and 2 fen. If it is spread evenly over six months, 4 fen will be paid in each of the first to fifth installments, and 8 fen will be paid in the sixth installment. (2) The face value of the Reconstruction Public Bond is a minimum of 100 yuan, and the interest for half a year is 3 yuan. After deducting the income tax of 1 jiao and 9 fen, the net amount is 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. If it is spread evenly over six months, 4 jiao and 7 fen will be paid in each of the first to fifth installments, and 5 jiao will be paid in the sixth installment.</p>
<p>Public Debt Market Gradually Stabilizing</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Stock Exchange suspended trading, the spot trading on the seventh floor of the exchange cannot be regarded as a formal exchange, so its market price cannot be regarded as a formal price. Yesterday, trading rose sharply by several jiao in the morning and fell back in the afternoon, which was still considered stable. Yesterday's closing prices were: Unified Class A, 56 yuan, up 2 jiao from the previous day; Class B, 49 yuan and 2 jiao, down 3 jiao from the previous day; Class C, 48 yuan and 4 jiao, down 4 jiao from the previous day; Class D had no trading yesterday afternoon, and the closing price in the morning was 48 yuan and 4 jiao, up 4 jiao from the previous day; Class E, 48 yuan and 1 jiao, down 2 jiao from the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Wuxi Suburbs: Guerrilla Warfare - Deng's Troops Expand to Four Thousand; Japanese and Puppets Rampant in Meicun and Tangkou <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that, according to recent accounts from individuals arriving in Shanghai from Wuxi, the current situation in Wuxi is as follows, recorded as a report for Wuxi natives in Shanghai: Commander Deng Benyin's guerrilla forces in Jiangsu Province, remnants of the Guangdong army from the Songhu Battle two years prior who did not retreat but remained in the Wuxi area, originally numbered over eight hundred men but have now expanded to four thousand. Except for the urban districts, Wuxi is entirely under Deng's control. Therefore, the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun continues to fly in the Wuxi countryside. Commander Deng shares both hardships and comforts with his soldiers and forms a complete bond with the populace.</p>
<p>Consequently, local puppet organizations dare not collect land taxes in the rural areas. Furthermore, in early December of last year, when Huang Wencai's troops of Huangdai openly displayed the flag of the Provisional Fourth Regiment of the Pacification Corps of the puppet provincial government in Houzhai, they were immediately disarmed. The following day, a large force returned to counterattack but was surrounded and suppressed by Deng's troops, who seized one hundred and seventeen rifles, fifteen Mauser pistols and handguns, and four light machine guns, and killed sixty-three men. Consequently, the pacification corps in that area was entirely eliminated, and Huang Wencai was forced to flee. After this victory, Deng moved his troops</p>
<p>towards Wujin,</p>
<p>returning approximately half a month later. Unfortunately, they encountered a battle on the Shanghai-Nanjing highway near Jiaoshan, resulting in the simultaneous deaths of Deng Wuzhen, team leader Mei Jianfeng, and eight other officers and soldiers. In this battle, team leader Deng Yuanzhen, with a small number of soldiers, resisted for two hours, preventing a large contingent of Japanese soldiers from advancing further. Deng's main force was then able to pass safely, demonstrating great courage. Following this sacrifice by Deng's troops, Zhu Bingdie of Anzhen openly accepted a puppet appointment, ordering his subordinate, W Yaozu, to move his unit to Xicheng for training. Deng suspected Zhu Bingdie's involvement in the Jiaoshan battle. Upon learning that Zhu Bingdie was planning to meet with Zhang Xuezeng in Meicun, Deng intercepted him midway,</p>
<p>executing him</p>
<p>and displaying his head in the Zhangjingqiao area as a warning to the public. However, Zhu Bingdie's subordinates, the following day, moved to Meicun and conducted a large-scale search as revenge, causing losses to various stores in Meicun town. Those who did not manage to escape were bound and subjected to torture. Meicun remained closed for a week. It is reported that Japanese troops are now stationed there. As for the Wuxi urban area, Yun Guozhen's troops frequently launch attacks. Last New Year's Eve, a Japanese accountant from the Xinchang Silk Factory at Huangnishu outside the South Gate was shot and killed while riding in a chartered car. Furthermore, on the first day of the new year, a Japanese soldier guarding a position in Dougang was shot and killed within the city. Therefore,</p>
<p>the city is frequently under curfew.</p>
<p>Kidnappings are rampant within the city, with dozens of cases already reported. Those with some wealth live in constant fear. Five days ago, two Japanese soldiers were killed at the Dagong Bridge pier outside the South Gate. Recently, on the ninth, at 5:00 PM at the Qingming Bridge puppet tax checkpoint outside the South Gate, eight small boats passed by. The puppet checkpoint demanded that they stop to pay taxes. The boats, belonging to a certain guerrilla unit, complied, and the unit's leader forced the five puppet tax collectors into the boats and sailed south. Their whereabouts remain unknown. Japanese troops are stationed in Tangkou town. On the afternoon of the fifth of this month, they were suddenly</p>
<p>attacked by Xiong Jiandong's unit,</p>
<p>resulting in the shooting death of one Japanese soldier and the capture of another. Consequently, the town is now heavily fortified, with Xinqiao serving as the most important stronghold, equipped with electric fences. Xin'an town has been relatively peaceful recently, but Japanese soldiers who come to repair railways and power lines continue to harass the countryside, seizing pigs, chickens, and food. They continue to commit bestial acts against women. Consequently, upon hearing their approach, villagers flee in terror. Most abhorrently, some act as lackeys, leading them into villages to carry out their atrocities. The Zhangjingqiao area was originally defended by Zhou Zhengang's troops, but since their resistance against the Japanese</p>
<p>in Gushan and elsewhere,</p>
<p>a company of Japanese soldiers has arrived, and the local forces have retreated towards the Jiangyin border. When Nanfangquan fell, it was extremely prosperous, but ultimately it was coveted by bandits and subjected to looting. Now, it is entirely protected by local residents. Huadafang Village, located near the Suzhou-Wuxi highway, has become a contested area since two Japanese soldiers were shot and killed there last month. When Japanese troops arrive, the guerrillas withdraw, and when they leave, the guerrillas return. It is said that the unit leader is Gu Zhengchu.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Puppet Regime Establishes Fresh Meat Market; Fresh Meat Industry Refuses to Participate - Puppet Regime Attempts to Monopolize Fresh Meat Industry, Imposes Heavy "Removal Tax" in Occupied Areas <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Due to increased taxes in the interior, the cost of pork has risen, leading to an increase in market prices. The puppet regime, imitating the fish market model, plans to establish a fresh meat market in an attempt to monopolize the business. This is still underway, but due to the industry's lack of cooperation, it may be difficult to achieve in the short term. The Fresh Meat Industry Guild is closely monitoring its development and has warned its members not to participate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increase in Pork Taxes</p>
<p>The source of fresh pork in Shanghai is primarily Tongzhou, Rugao, Jingjiang in northern Jiangsu, as well as Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places. The puppet regime, facing economic exhaustion, is resorting to extreme measures of exploitation, implementing a "removal tax" in all occupied areas. Each fresh pig is subject to an additional tax of over one yuan. This tax will also be imposed at various ports in northern Jiangsu within days. As a result, the price of pork in Shanghai has increased due to the added costs of transportation and miscellaneous taxes, making a price hike unavoidable.</p>
<p>Monopoly Attempt</p>
<p>The puppet regime intends to monopolize the fresh meat industry in Shanghai by establishing a fresh meat market modeled after the puppet fish market, entirely managed by the puppet regime. They plan to build the market near Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu. The registration procedures and engineering drawings have been properly handled. The industry association knows that the puppet regime is full of tricks and are unwilling to be exploited by them, refusing to invest and participate. Despite the persuasions of several individuals, they have adamantly refused. The industry guild has sternly warned its members not to participate, to avoid future regrets.</p>

<p>River transportation on the Huangpu River is divided into two types: long-distance and short-distance. After the war, most of the ferry crossings upstream and downstream have not yet been opened. Of those that have opened, the operating rights are mostly controlled by Japanese merchants. Recently, the puppet "Public Works Bureau" has also seized private ferries in an attempt to profit. Japanese merchants are also engaged in competition and seizure of business among themselves. Therefore, the ferry industry on the Huangpu River is in a state of complete chaos. The findings of our investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Control - The Shanggao Long-Distance Ferry</p>
<p>Before the war, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company operated a long-distance ferry line between Shanghai and Wusong, with stops at the Puxi Xidu (West Ferry), Qingning Temple (Gaomiao), Donggou, and Gaoqiao. After the war, several emerging foreign ferry companies sought to seize the operating rights of this long-distance ferry. However, Wusong and Xidu have not been opened, so only the Gaomiao, Donggou, and Gaoqiao routes can be operated. At the time, the competitors included Welfare, Mahler, Changfeng, Huitong, Shanghai, and five or six others. In the end, the Shanghai Ferry Company, due to its Japanese capital, obtained exclusive operating rights, controlling the long-distance ferry business on the Shanggao three routes. The other companies were eliminated. The so-called Shanghai Ferry Company is operated by the Japanese Nissin Shipping Company. The ferries used are mostly Shanghai municipal ferries seized after the war and repainted. Because the ferry fares are high, exceeding pre-war levels by more than a factor of two, the profits are substantial.</p>
<p>Puppet Organizations Actually Seize Private Ferries</p>
<p>After the establishment of the puppet "Municipal Government," the puppet mayor Fu Xiaoan and the puppet "Public Works Bureau Director" Zhao Guangdi originally planned to reclaim all the long-distance and short-distance ferries on the Huangpu River, in accordance with pre-war practices, in order to align with the name of the puppet "Municipal Ferry." They requested that the Japanese side reclaim the Shanggao three-route long-distance ferry and its ferries. Unexpectedly, as a result of negotiations, Fu Zhao's request was completely rejected. The puppet "Municipal Government," failing to achieve its goal, believed it would lose face. Thus, between Jiujiang Road on the Bund and Qichang Road in Pudong, they solicited businesses to jointly operate a cross-river ferry line, with only two small motorboats, calling it the puppet "Municipal Ferry." The profits are divided six-four. Because the one-way ferry fare is one jiao, four times the pre-war rate (before the municipal government-run cross-river ferry, the one-way fare was only eight copper coins), there are few customers. It is difficult to profit. Recently, seeing that the cross-river ferry jointly operated by the Pudong Nanmatou (South Pier) and the Nanshi Nanmatou was thriving and profitable, they suddenly dispatched a motorboat on the fifteenth, towing two ferries, claiming to be the "Municipal Ferry," seizing the business of the private ferries. On the contrary, they restricted the existing private ferry businesses to manual operation, prohibiting the use of tows, causing their business to decline and automatically shut down.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Merchants Compete for the Shangzhou Long-Distance Ferry</p>
<p>The two ferry crossings at the Zhoujiadu Nanmatou in Pudong were originally granted to the Japanese Yamashita Company by the Japanese Southern Huinan Garrison to operate a long-distance ferry directly to the Jiujiang Road Pier on the Bund in the Public Concession. The former ferry crossing connected to the Shangnan Railway, while the latter maintained transportation between the Concession and Nanshi. Passengers going to Nanshi could take this ferry from the Bund to the Pudong Nanmatou, then take the cross-river ferry to the Nanshi Nanmatou, and vice versa. The business was also quite developed. However, the Shanghai Company, believing it had exclusive control over the ferry service on the Huangpu River, suddenly dispatched two ferries on November 5 of last year to operate on these two long-distance routes, and forcibly ordered the two Nanhui Maru ferries owned by Yamashita Company to cease operations. Yamashita Company suffered heavy losses within two months. After appealing to the Japanese officials, they recently dispatched the Nanhui Maru ferry to resume operations. The Shanghai Company, due to the sluggish business, reduced the number of ferries dispatched to one Dongying Maru ferry, competing with the Nanhui Maru. Japanese merchants and Japanese merchants created an industry grabbing wave, the inside is not for the eyes of those outside the industry.</p>

<p>The Headquarters of the 10th Group Army of Zhejiang Province recently announced the approval of sailing vessels on various routes in eastern Zhejiang, totaling forty-eight vessels, and promulgated six regulations for navigation. Regarding the issue of fare reductions and passenger tickets for Shanghai-Ningbo vessels, the joint meeting of the Yinxian Party, Government, Military, Police, and Legal Affairs has passed restrictive measures, ordering the Ningbo Shipping Industry Association to forward them to various shipping companies for compliance.

<p>Six Newly Promulgated Navigation Regulations</p>
<p>The Ningbo Defense Headquarters recently promulgated six new navigation regulations as follows: (1) Vessels traveling between Wenzhou and Taizhou and the Yong River are allowed to enter two vessels and exit two vessels per week. However, vessels carrying temporarily approved cargo are of a temporary nature and are not subject to the above restrictions. (See Qiaochen's telegraph regarding participation in the war.) The above refers to vessels entering and leaving the Yong River estuary. Vessels traveling inland within this area, such as Dinghai and Shenjiamen, have been approved to be exempt from restrictions. (See Jingyi's telegraph regarding participation in the war.) (2) The Shanghai-Ningbo route is still temporarily not allowed to operate. (See Zhenyou Dezheng's telegraph.) (3) Vessels traveling on the Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo line are prohibited from sailing to Shanghai. Vessels on the Wenzhou-Taizhou-Shanghai line are prohibited from sailing to Ningbo. (See Yangwei's telegraph regarding participation in the war.) (4) Those temporarily approved to transport local goods to Shanghai must comply with the regulations in Huiyi's telegraph regarding participation in the war. When returning from Shanghai, they are only allowed to return to Wenzhou and Taizhou. (See Yangwei's telegraph regarding participation in the war.) (5) For cargo exported to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, a certificate must first be requested from the Property Adjustment Office and submitted to the department for approval. (See Gengyi Dezheng and Gengwu Dezheng's telegrams.) (6) Approved cargo from Ningbo to Shanghai may be transported by any approved and registered vessel. (See Huiyi's telegraph regarding participation in the war.)</p>
<p>Restrictions on Fares and Ticket Prices</p>
<p>Various shipping companies in Shanghai received a notice from the Ningbo Shipping Industry Association yesterday, stating (excerpt): "According to Order No. 278 from the Yinxian Party, Government, Military, Police, and Legal Affairs Joint Meeting, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce submitted a report stating that the fares and cabin tickets on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Oujiang routes have increased, requesting appropriate restrictions to benefit merchants and travelers. This was discussed at the 126th meeting of this conference and resolved to calculate recent fare prices at 70%. The price of cabin tickets is limited to one yuan and five jiao for steerage, four yuan for cabins, and six yuan for official cabins. Tea room tips are at the discretion of the passengers and should not be forcibly solicited. This record is to be strictly adhered to by all ships."</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Inquire About Fare Standards</p>
<p>After receiving the notice from the Ningbo Shipping Industry Association, the Shanghai Italian-Chinese Shipping Company decided to comply. However, there were doubts about calculating the fare reduction at 70%. Yesterday, they specifically telegraphed to inquire about the truth. The original telegram stated: "Having received the telegraph of Tiaoyou and learned of Order No. 278 from the Party, Government, Military, Police, and Legal Affairs Joint Meeting, based on the request from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, limiting the ticket price to one yuan and five jiao for steerage, four yuan for cabins, and six yuan for official cabins, with tea room tips at the discretion of the passengers and should not be forcibly solicited, it is permissible to comply. However, the freight should be calculated at 70%. This refers to the tariff jointly agreed upon by Swire, Sanbei, Ning, and Shao in May, which is what this company and Swire have always charged, and the price has not been increased. If we calculate 70% of this price, the passengers will truly benefit. If we calculate based on the current freight from Yongwan and Haimen to Shanghai, it will be more than double, which seems to be a substantial benefit to the passengers, directly affecting cargo and passengers, and indirectly affecting the countryside. What freight rate should be used as the standard? Please have the shipping association inquire with the authorities for clarification."</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Public Protects National Taxes: All Receipts are Affixed with Stamps - Customers Refuse to Accept Receipts Without Stamps - Because Carrying Them to the Interior Will Result in Confiscation of Goods <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Since the stamp tax was put in place in Shanghai, all ledgers and receipts have been affixed with stamps. Before the war, stamps were required for invoices and receipts starting from three yuan. Now, according to the temporary measures during the emergency period, a stamp of one fen is required for every yuan. Merchants and the public are protecting national taxes, and there is absolutely no intentional evasion. Even if a stamp is accidentally omitted, it is immediately affixed upon customer correction. Furthermore, because goods carried to the interior must be accompanied by invoices, and in areas controlled by guerrillas, if an invoice is found without a stamp, the goods are immediately confiscated as a warning to those who do not protect national taxes. Therefore, customers generally refuse to accept receipts without stamps to avoid trouble. In addition, some enthusiastic individuals are collecting and compiling lists of unstamped receipts from various stores and reporting them to the Ministry of Finance as evidence for future double penalties. Therefore, all merchants in the city are unwilling to risk greater losses for small gains and bring trouble upon themselves.</p>

<p>The fellow provincial fundraising committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been actively working on fundraising in two aspects since the establishment of the founding meeting. Regarding the piggy bank relief movement, the first standing committee has requested committee members Cao Zhigong and Chen Jicheng to review the detailed measures. For the sake of economy, the required piggy banks will be solicited from all walks of life to be converted from cigarette cans and canned goods. Huacheng Can Manufacturing Company has agreed to provide free modification services. It is planned to first distribute them to the families of members of fellow provincial organizations and various elementary schools, and then extend to other areas. Various fellow provincial organizations have begun to organize fundraising teams in accordance with the fundraising methods decided by the general assembly, promoting fundraising work. Entertainment fundraising is also in preparation.</p>
<p>Department Stores Propose - Withholding Payment for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Industry Guild has always been enthusiastic about refugee relief. Chairman Zhang Wenkui, in addition to following the circular from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to withhold one and two-tenths percent of employee salaries and wages, with labor and capital each contributing half, as relief funds, also proposed that members withhold two-thousandths of the purchase price value when paying accounts to provide relief to refugees. This was approved by the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the guild and implemented from February 1. A receipt has been reported to the Relief Association, collected, and distributed to various members for filling out at any time. On the other hand, the association will issue a public notice.</p>
<p>Xinya Factory - School Opens Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chao, General Manager, Mr. Gu Keming, Manager, and Mr. Zhao Rutiao, Factory Director of the Shanghai Xinya Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory in Xinzha Road, previously identified 30 orphans from the Children's Education and Care Home and planned to sponsor the Xinya Orphan Factory to teach them pharmaceutical skills so that they could have a skill to support themselves in society after they came of age. The factory held its opening ceremony yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at No. 9 Sheng Deli, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, Shanghai Children's Education and Care Home.

Subsequently, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, Cai Renbao, Xi Yushu, Chen Jicheng, and others delivered speeches of encouragement. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. Yesterday, the Children's Education and Care Home sent 10 children, aged 13 to 18, to learn how to manufacture vaccine ampoules. Its future is truly unpredictable.</p>
<p>Xinyi Branch - Continues to Pledge Donations</p>
<p>The Municipal Fundraising Committee recently received a letter from Mr. Gu Yucang, Factory Director of the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory Branch, and all colleagues, stating: "Relief for refugees is a benevolent act. All Chinese people should be inspired to act benevolently, share this spirit, and actively pledge donations for relief. The factory's employees, all of whom are fellow countrymen, do not want to fall behind. In addition to the 75 yuan previously pledged during the expansion of broadcasting and fundraising, which has already been paid in full, we are now pledging an additional 106 yuan in national currency. Enclosed are 20 pledge forms, totaling 181 yuan including the previous ones. Please check and receive. We will continue to pledge donations in the future to show our modest efforts."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Japan Leases Four Hundred Foreign Vessels - There is Talk of Returning All Leases - Because Lease Fees Must be Paid in Foreign Exchange - New Cabinet Decides to Curb It <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that after the news that Japanese shipping companies will return the 400 foreign ships they are currently leasing was released yesterday (the 17th), it shocked the global shipping industry. These ships are all freighters and various types of vessels, many of which belong to the United Kingdom. Japanese shipping companies needed ships due to the "China Incident", so they leased these ships and naturally had to pay in foreign currency, usually</p>
<p>in gold pounds.</p>
<p>The foreign currency earned by Japanese ships sailing around the world is used to pay the lease fees. Currently, the foreign exchange value of the Japanese yen is 9 pence. In Japan, it maintains a false value of 1 shilling and 2 pence. The Japanese government, in order to cope with the difference in value between the two, provides some subsidies to shipping companies that lease foreign ships. Therefore, these ships</p>
<p>earn a lot of revenue,</p>
<p>so Japan's major shipping companies have profited handsomely from operating foreign ships. However, it is reported that the new Japanese cabinet has decided to curb the outflow of this national foreign exchange, and in the future, Japan will use Japanese ships to meet the current huge shipping needs. The two major Japanese companies directly affected by this new law are Yamashita Kisen and Osaka Shosen. Yesterday, an employee of Osaka Shosen said that the company has leased</p>
<p>a large number of foreign ships.</p>
<p>The British Mahler Company in Shanghai, the largest company operating irregular shipping services, is said to be directly affected by this decision in Tokyo. Mahler Company has several ships leased to Japanese shipping companies. It is said that several of the company's freighters whose leases have expired have already been returned. Yesterday, a British merchant engaged in shipping said that there is no problem in immediately terminating and returning leased ships, but leases are for three months, six months, or even a year. Therefore, the ships may not be returned immediately, but will wait to be re-leased.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Customs Japanese Staff Promotion Issue - Japanese Newspapers Self-Promote - Responsible Party States - There is Absolutely No Such Fact <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Japanese-language Continental News, which is obviously being directed by the authorities to promote the addition of Japanese employees to the customs, published a report on Monday (the 16th) stating that the current promotion system for customs employees will be greatly changed soon. Yesterday, reporters inquired with the responsible party about this matter, and it was said that this is self-promotion. They were not aware of the matter and had never even heard of it. According to the Continental News, the customs authorities are currently considering a major change in fact. Japanese customs officials will soon be promoted every two years. According to current customs practice, staff are promoted every three years, but Japanese staff must be promoted every five years. The new plan is to shorten the five-year promotion system for Japanese staff to two years. This is an attempt by the British, who hold the sovereignty of the customs, to ease the feelings of the Japanese regarding customs issues.</p>

<p>The "China Press" reports that Father Kilche, the director of the Xujiahui Dog Latin writer, and Father Sucolci of Vatican Radio are working together on wireless radio experiments. If the results are satisfactory, broadcasts from Vatican City in Rome can be received by local radio stations and rebroadcast to listeners here. This experiment is scheduled to begin today (the 18th). The Vatican Radio station will broadcast programs at 5, 6, and 7 PM (Shanghai time), with a wavelength of 16.87 meters. Tomorrow's experiment will take place at the same time, with a wavelength of 19.84 meters. On the 20th, an experiment will be conducted at 9:30 AM, with a wavelength of 22.55 meters. Subsequently, the wavelength will be 30.06 meters. To ensure that Shanghai radio stations can rebroadcast its programs, all radio stations have been asked to tune in at the designated times and submit reports on their reception. Listeners are also requested to send letters to Father Kilche detailing their reception experiences and the types of radios used. According to Father Kilche, a few days ago, he was able to receive the station's broadcast at 9 AM (Shanghai time) with considerable clarity.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet Inspects the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, a Trip of Great Significance, Expected to Return to Shanghai Around Sunday <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Mr. Gauss, the US Consul General in Shanghai, left Shanghai at 8:30 AM this morning (the 18th) to inspect the Yangtze River upstream. This trip was almost unheard of beforehand. According to information obtained last night, Yarnell and Gauss boarded the US ship USS Isabel at 8:30 AM from Shanghai. Gauss was scheduled to board the ship at 8:00 AM. The USS Isabel is Yarnell's</p>
<p>private yacht.</p>
<p>It has been docked in Shanghai for three months. After the USS Augusta sailed from Shanghai to Manila last month, Yarnell's office was set up on that yacht. According to sources last night, Yarnell and Gauss's trip to the Yangtze River has been under consideration for some time, but all plans regarding this trip were kept almost entirely secret. Except for Yarnell's staff and a few members of the US Consulate General,</p>
<p>no one knew</p>
<p>about this matter. When someone visited Gauss yesterday to inquire, Gauss admitted that he would be traveling to the Yangtze River with Yarnell, but he did not say another word about it, only saying that it was a "small trip" and had no major political implications. According to the current plan, the USS Isabel will carry the two men to Wuhu, and they will make a short stop in Nanjing. On Friday (the 20th) evening, the ship will arrive in Wuhu and stay overnight. It will sail to Shanghai the next day and is expected to return to Shanghai on Sunday. Although all plans for this trip</p>
<p>have been kept secret,</p>
<p>Yarnell and Gauss's trip to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is of great significance, especially considering that the United States sent a strong note to Tokyo on December 30 regarding Japan's "Open Door" policy. Furthermore, the US naval transport ship USS Henderson, carrying approximately 700 sailors, left Shanghai on Monday (the 16th) to return to the United States. According to reports, the ship encountered</p>
<p>bad weather</p>
<p>between Shanghai and Hong Kong yesterday morning, but the details are unknown in this city. The USS Henderson is returning to the United States via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu. It is also expected that the US destroyers USS Alden and USS Edwards will arrive in Shanghai before the end of this month and may dock in Shanghai for several weeks.</p>

<p>The English "North China Daily News" reports that regarding the Municipal Council's salary increase dispute, all lower-ranked employees are indignant and uneasy today (the 18th), and have proposed convening a meeting at a rented location. However, the employees holding key positions are smug and satisfied. A Municipal Council spokesperson recently stated that the employees whose salaries have been greatly increased are diligent and experienced. When reporters asked lower-ranked employees in the council about this, they said with a laugh that all the heads of departments, except for one, have been promoted from lower-ranked employees. This morning, reporters asked the Municipal Council spokesperson what actions the council is taking regarding their indignation. The spokesperson replied that no action has been taken yet. At the same time, lower-ranked Municipal Council employees are holding meetings in various departments within the council to decide on a protest against the large disparity in salary increases between them and the heads of departments. Some meetings have already been held, and others are still being convened. The results of all meetings will be reported to the Staff Association. After the opinions of the lower-ranked employees have been decided, the association will negotiate with the council. However, the police constables in the Police Department are not members of the Staff Association, and due to their job responsibilities, it is difficult to convene meetings, so they have not been able to express their opinions. Taxpayers, like the lower-ranked employees of the council, have also expressed their indignation over the fact that high salaries are increased again, resulting in an annual waste of 600,000 yuan, and have proposed convening a general meeting or a special taxpayers' meeting. It is understood that they are currently contacting the Grand Theatre to borrow it for free, or renting a large hotel room for the meeting. What kind of action the Municipal Council intends to take, or whether it will cancel the salary increase proposal for senior employees before paying salaries this month, remains unknown.</p>

<p>The Wang Yiting memorial service, initiated by the Renji Hall, Cilian Association, Red Cross Society, Chinese Buddhist Association, Subei Disaster Relief Association, and other charitable and fraternal organizations in this city, is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Overlapping Posthumous Titles</p>
<p>The preparatory office of the association held its fourth preparatory meeting at Renji Hall at 3 PM yesterday afternoon, chaired by Huang Hanzhi. The first topic discussed was the issue of posthumous titles. During the previous preparatory meeting, it was unanimously decided to posthumously confer the title "Mr. Chenghui." However, when the Lake Society held a memorial service on the 15th, the title "Mr. Minghui" was conferred. Therefore, the meeting discussed whether the association should continue to posthumously confer a title.</p>
<p>Remedial Measures Decided</p>
<p>After discussion, it was decided that since the Lake Society also sent representatives to the previous meeting when it was decided to confer the title "Chenghui," the representatives of the Lake Society should return to the society, convene a meeting, and negotiate in good faith whether to cancel the conferred title "Minghui." If possible, they should reply in writing before the 21st. Then, this association will still hold the ceremony to confer the title "Chenghui." Otherwise, this association will give up conferring a title, as only one posthumous title is allowed.</p>
<p>Memorial Service Schedule Arranged</p>
<p>Finally, it was also decided: 1. To set up a general office at the Lake Society, from the 20th to the 23rd. 2. The layout of the Lake Society's entrance will be handled by the design and general affairs groups. The layout of the altar at the meeting place will be handled by Long Xiaoyun and Jin Tiejun. Subsequently, the masters of ceremonies, flower offerings, incense offerings, libations, ushers, eulogy readers, and title conferral, as well as the memorial service procedures and title conferral ceremonies, were determined. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>

<p>The Japanese army in Pudong has been using puppet troops as guides in the guerilla areas of Pudong in recent days, rigorously searching for the whereabouts of guerilla troops. At Tangkou Town, Shanghai County, Section 5 which lies along the banks bordering the district between Shanghai and Nanhui County, a hundred or so Japanese troops landed in the early morning under the cover of a small warship and engaged in fierce fighting with the Loyal Salvation Army. The Chinese forces fought bravely for several hours and, after completing their attrition strategy, dispersed into the surrounding villages. Fearing encirclement, the Japanese troops retreated in the afternoon without gaining anything. The town was subsequently recovered by the Chinese forces.</p>
<p>Nanhui</p>
<p>Between Weixiang and Longwangmiao in the fourth district of the county, not far from the border of Shanghai, a guerilla unit is also stationed. A battle took place in Weixiang a few days ago. At midnight on the 15th, the Japanese garrison from Nanmatou sent seventy to eighty soldiers, hoping to disperse the guerilla force. However, the Chinese forces pre-emptively struck, meeting the Japanese east of Longwangmiao. They engaged in a fierce exchange of fire, with the sound of guns and cannons mixing together for about an hour. The Japanese troops failed to achieve their goal and retreated to their base. The Chinese forces maintained their original stronghold.</p>
<p>Zhoupu</p>
<p>The town of Zhaolou, ten miles southwest of Zhoupu, belongs to the sixth district of Nanhui County. Last March, the Japanese army burned down more than ten old houses in Songyun Xiaoge. In November, they burned down over one hundred houses, a large residence belonging to Xi Meisheng, the former director of the Shanghai pawnshop industry. Three days ago, based on reports from traitors, the Japanese troops in Zhoupu indicated that the town was again a base for Wang Boxiang's guerilla unit. At 11 PM, they sent over one hundred soldiers on six large barges to attack by waterway. After arriving at the town, they realized that there were no guerilla troops and the raid was unsuccessful. Traitors, desperate to gain credit, falsely accused a certain family's house of being Wang's headquarters and set fire to over twenty rooms.</p>
<p>Shangchuan</p>
<p>After Hu Zhenhai's troops on Luchuan Road recovered the four towns, the Japanese army once pressed in with six hundred heavily armed soldiers. Now, the troops under Hu and Yu Taosheng counterattacked and drove the Japanese troops out of the town. According to a person from Chuansha yesterday, there was a fierce battle near Zhujiaqiao recently, and the situation is unclear, but the Japanese army's intention to pass through Zhujiaqiao and enter Nanhui City has not been fulfilled, indicating the intensity of the battle. As for Zhang Huifang's troops, they have moved to the seaside area of ​​Heqing to protect Tang Yaoyu, the new magistrate of Chuansha. Those stationed at Zhuqiao are the troops under Yu and Hu. It is also said that the recent battles, large and small, in Zhuqiao have lasted for a week.</p>

<p>Xu Xiaochu: Xu Xiaochu has been promoted to general manager of Sino-French Pharmacy. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jilong, and others jointly sent a commemorative speech, the original text of which reads: "Mr. Xiaochu has been the manager of Sino-French Pharmacy Co., Ltd. for five years, and his business has advanced greatly, and the production of new self-made drugs has also increased day by day. His hard work is well-known, and the hearts of the public are increasingly attached to him. Therefore, the directors of the board have decided to promote Mr. Xiaochu to general manager starting from the first day of the Republic of China's 28th year (1939), showing their respect for talented people, and entrusting him with even greater responsibilities. At first, Mr. Xiaochu declined, but they insisted several times, and then he agreed. This is because it was a decision made by public opinion, and it cannot be moved by humility. We believe that Mr. Xiaochu is a Bachelor of Arts from Fudan University, and he is also rooted in family learning, so his knowledge is vast and his talent for management is more than enough to shoulder heavy responsibilities. Everything he does for the company's daily reforms and other social undertakings is based on learning, so it is appropriate for him to be disciplined and accomplished. However, it is different from the ordinary people. Now, he is in charge of a company's affairs, which is just a test of his ability. He and others have been friends with him for a long time, and they admire his character. They respectfully present this speech at the beginning of his promotion to congratulate him on the advancement of his future career. "The speech says: "Oh, the famous Yihui from Anhui, came from the Qing family of Dingmao, early devoted himself to literature and history, and studied the mysteries of the dog. Once, he held Gao's pen, enticing many scholars to follow him step by step. Moved by the past of Bai Gui, admiring the high reputation of Kang Bo, he suddenly traveled to the market, collecting elixirs to delight his heart. Thinking of the suffering of the people, he wished to help all living beings. Reading books to serve the world, how can we not engage in business when the commercial war is in full swing? The world values ​​wealth and strength, how can the market be taken lightly? The learning of An Ding, emphasizes both scripture and governance, recalling the seven strategies of Ji Ran, which were used to prosper the country. When Chi Yi retired and lived in Tao, he also engaged in trade. How can a gentleman who revitalizes his career be confined to one pattern? Everything originates from learning, and the source has been traced and the flow divided. If we examine the consistency of our path, where will the strategy not work? Bringing long-term talent to trade, the industry is changing day by day and month by month. The plans are evident in the achievements, and the benefits extend to the people. Unanimously recommended at home and abroad, his position and achievements have increased. It is appropriate for a talented person to shoulder heavy responsibilities, entrusting the power and responsibility to one person. Knowing that the command is calm, the path is progressing to a higher level. Glad to see the renewal of the seasons, turning the king and adjusting the spring, praising the pepper flowers and accepting the matter, on the auspicious occasion of the beginning of the year. Looking at the far-reaching future, may it increasingly open up the economic management."</p>

<p>Tangwan Town, in the county, borders the Binpu area and is relatively remote. After the fall of Shanghai in the war two years ago, the Japanese army once occupied it, but it was later recovered by the guerilla forces after being besieged and attacked. Therefore, that corner has long been controlled by the National Army. Although the Japanese have repeatedly tried to invade, they have been repelled. At around 11 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese unit encountered Chinese forces in a fierce battle in the Neichegouqiao area northeast of the town. The battle lasted for four or five hours. Japanese warships docked along the shore of Longhua Cement Factory also sailed to assist in the battle. Approximately three to four hundred Japanese troops were dispatched from Beiqiao and other places to reinforce. The guerilla troops were commanded by Commander Weng Tuoming. Due to the disparity in numbers, they dispersed and ambushed the enemy. In this battle, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed. The situation there is still very tense.</p>

<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's litigation procedures are based on Chinese law, due to treaty relations, they differ slightly from those in other provinces and counties. In Shanghai, there are (1) the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court (also known as the Nanshi Court), (2) the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court (i.e., the Public Concession), and (3) the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court (i.e., the French Concession). These three local courts all fall within the former Jiangsu Province area. Therefore, although the Shanghai Municipal Government, an administrative organ, is directly under the central government, the judicial area remains as before. Thus, Shanghai County, Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and all areas formerly under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Police are under the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court. As for the two concessions, each originally had a Mixed Court. On January 1, 1927, the Public Concession first established the Shanghai Provisional Court. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Consular Body signed the Provisional Regulations for the Recovery of the Shanghai Mixed Court, which were implemented on a trial basis for three years. On February 17, 1930, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China and the Shanghai Consular Body signed the "Agreement on Chinese Courts in the Shanghai Concessions," namely, the agreement on the establishment of local courts and high court branches in the Shanghai Public Concession, and April 1 was set as the date of implementation of the agreement. On July 28, 1931, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China and the French Minister signed the "Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the Shanghai French Concession," which was implemented from July 31 of the same month. Since then, Shanghai's judicial power has been completely归属于to the courts of the Republic of China. However, in criminal cases, except for private prosecutions, the prosecution is still initiated by the police organs of the respective concession's Municipal Council. (Prosecutors may also exercise their functions for several crimes such as treason.) Judicial police still use the patrolmen of the police stations, which is also due to factual relations.</p>
<p>Therefore, litigation in Shanghai takes three routes. First, cases in the Public Concession are first litigated in the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Second, cases in the French Concession are first litigated in the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. As for cases outside the concessions, they are first litigated in the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. Third instance appeals all belong to the Supreme Court. Since the sudden outbreak of the August 13th Songhu Battle, Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Shanghai County have fallen one after another, the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court has naturally been suspended, and the Jiangsu High Court, located in Suzhou, has also been suspended due to the war. Therefore, the only places where litigation can proceed are the two special districts, namely the Public Concession and the French Concession. Moreover, because the Supreme Court has moved to Chongqing, which is far from Shanghai, it is very inconvenient to appeal cases. Therefore, the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has been established in Shanghai to facilitate Chinese and foreign litigants. Some people say that the Shanghai concessions are adjacent to each other, so why not merge the local high courts into one? This is due to treaty relations. Before consular jurisdiction is abolished, this system is not easy to change. Here is a question: In the area of ​​roads built beyond the boundary, the roads are indeed patrolled by concession police, but the houses and land along the roads are still not part of the concession. Can the special district court have jurisdiction and handle its litigation cases together? Because the construction of roads beyond the boundary is not a concession signed by the state in the treaty. Since it is not a concession, the special district court will naturally not accept it unless the parties agree to request jurisdiction in the special district court, except for special legal restrictions. This is a legal provision, and the judicial organ has no right to change it without authorization. In short, the judiciary is an extremely important power of the state, and litigation is a method of redressing infringed rights. Where the national power lies, the judicial power lies. The Chinese courts in the two concessions of Shanghai continue to perform their duties as usual, which is also a proof of the existence of the national power of the Republic of China. Chinese and foreign residents naturally attach importance to it. How can they take the litigation procedure lightly?</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th of this month, at around 11 PM, five armed robbers broke into the Yitai Xing Coal Store at 184 Xinzha Road, stealing tens of thousands of yuan in legal tender. The owner immediately reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station for investigation. Since the occurrence of this case, the police station has been paying close attention, dispatching detectives to investigate in all directions, sparing no effort. At around 10 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Pi Bingzhang and Western Detective Leader Litte of the Xinzha Police Station, along with Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, employees of the Yitai Xing Coal Store, went out to patrol the roads in search of the robber gang in this case. Later, they boarded Bus No. 7 at Jing'an Temple. At that time, employees Hu and Meng suddenly pointed out a</p>
<p>passenger on the bus</p>
<p>who was wearing a suit, claiming he was one of the robbers. The Chinese and Western detectives immediately arrested him and brought him to the police station. Upon questioning, the man in the suit identified himself as Lin Jiabin, a native of Haining, Zhejiang, 28 years old. To verify the identification, the police ordered Lin to change into a blue cloth gown, and also had more than ten other people wear blue cloth gowns, mixing Lin among them. They then instructed the employees of Yitai Xing to come and identify him, who immediately pointed out Lin Jiabin. Believing Lin to be a major suspect, the police detained him and searched his home, confiscating 920 yuan in legal tender, five bank passbooks, one seal, eight silver dollars, and one gray overcoat, all of which were</p>
<p>brought to the police station.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station recounted the circumstances of the case, stating that the Yitai Xing Coal Store was quite large, with daily business of about 20,000 yuan. The day of the robbery happened to be Sunday night, so all the business revenue from Saturday and Sunday had not been deposited in the bank and was temporarily placed in three iron boxes upstairs and downstairs. The keys to all the iron boxes were held by the accountant, Chen Zhiming, who slept in the upstairs dormitory. There were 32 beds in the dormitory, and Chen's keys were hidden under his pillow. Unexpectedly, when the robbers arrived, they seemed</p>
<p>very familiar with the layout.</p>
<p>They first captured and monitored the gatekeeper, then went upstairs and directly reached Chen's bed, forcing him to hand over the keys. When Chen refused, the robbers automatically turned over the pillow, obtained the keys, opened the three iron boxes, and stole tens of thousands of yuan in cash, which they loaded into a bamboo basket. They also hired a Yunfei car by telephone to calmly carry the stolen goods away. It was not until the day before yesterday that Lin Jiabin was arrested. Currently, Lin is considered a major suspect in this case, and he has not been able to provide a definite explanation for the origin of the confiscated legal tender and all his actions that night. Therefore, the police requested permission to detain him for investigation. If no connection is found, the police will request his early release, he said. When questioned,</p>
<p>Lin Jiabin confessed</p>
<p>that he was a shareholder of the Fuhua Sock Factory, holding 480 yuan in shares. On the 15th of this month, Zhang Chulin of the Overseas Chinese Sock Factory in Baxianqiao asked me to borrow 1,000 yuan. So, I withdrew 500 yuan from the Bank of China, 200 yuan from the Kenye Bank, and scraped together 300 yuan to make 1,000 yuan, which I lent to Zhang Chulin. On the 16th, Zhang returned the 1,000 yuan, so it was placed at home, and so on. He also retained lawyer Xu Wufang to defend him. Judge Liu ruled that Lin be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>He Jingtian, manager of the Zhengfeng Qunji Sugar Firm at 17 Yong'an Road in the French Concession, formerly retained lawyer Mao Xianshen to act as his agent in suing Mei Shaoxiong, the firm's Guangdong-Guangxi business director, in the Second Criminal Tribunal of the Special District Court for breach of trust and fraud, for ignoring outstanding debts and secretly obstructing customers from paying out account funds amounting to 800,000 yuan. Defendant Mei Shaoxiong retained lawyer Ge Zhiqin to defend him. As a result, Mei Shaoxiong was acquitted. Because He Jingtian, the manager of Zhengfeng Firm, was dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment, he still retained lawyer Mao to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court,</p>
<p>raising an appeal</p>
<p>After several court hearings and investigations, details of which have been published in previous reports, the case was heard yesterday morning by the Collegial Panel of the Criminal Tribunal of the Third Branch of the High Court, headed by Court President Wu Tingqi, accompanied by Judges Chen Daqi and Wang Yue. Appellant He Jingtian stated the reasons for the appeal, saying that Zhengfeng Firm had been in business for many years. Because of its efforts to promote domestic sugar, it specially expanded its Guangdong-Guangxi region and hired the defendant Mei Shaoxiong as director, entrusting him with full authority and</p>
<p>responsibility for promotion, and first lent him 1,000 yuan, promising to exempt him from interest and to return it when he leaves. It was established on paper as an employment contract, full of hope to boost morale, fulfill duties, I didn't expect the defendant to</p>
<p>Be diligent in his duties</p>
<p>Following is lax, ignoring the rules of the industry, and the accounts released reached 780,000 gold, the appellant has no doubt, so he agreed to his resignation, but it was made clear that it would be the end, I don't know, I would break the trust. The agreement to delay the collection of accounts, all customers, also did not sell, deliberately delay, causing hundreds of customers, Zhengfeng Firm because of being helpless, that is, directly sent letters to various customers to urge management, I didn't know, because of the unclear location, the delivery could not be reached, some because of refusing to receive the original letter returned, before long, the full-scale war of resistance broke out, the defendant intensified, secretly sent letters to customers, preventing the return of accounts, deliberately destroying, not only the Zhengfeng Firm itself</p>
<p>Suffered and ceased operations</p>
<p>The cause of closure of thousands of workers due to being implicated by the business run by Zhengfeng Firm’s major shareholder, sugar tycoon Ding Ziying, the defendant ignores everything, and opens a Meisheng brand at 196, 591 Jing'an Temple Road, operating the same business as Zhengfeng Firm, and his personal debt of 8,000 gold to Zhengfeng Firm is not returned, and the account released by Zhengfeng Firm through his hands is intentionally left unfinished, so I believe, I request an investigation, revocation of the original judgment, and punishment of the defendant with</p>
<p>The crime he deserves</p>
<p>And so on, defendant Mei Shao , The defender Ge Zhiqin arrived at the case. After rebutting all the reasons of the appellant one by one, the court believed that the case was clear and ordered the end of the argument, and then announced the end of the trial.

As a result of the trial, Wang Jinsheng was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and Guo Fugen was sentenced to five years. Because Guo was dissatisfied with the judgment, he retained lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. The reason was that the appellant worked in a sock factory and lived a prosperous life, and would never dare to commit this illegal act. Although the victim was only six years old, she should be able to remember and recognize the appearance and figure of the abductor, but the victim has not been found. The original trial did not conduct a detailed investigation, and only made a judgment of five years of imprisonment for the appellant based on mere imagination and speculation, which is difficult to accept, and so on. This case has been tried, debated, and concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Court President Wu Tingqi, accompanied by Judges Chen and Wang, opened the court and rendered a judgment, revoking the original judgment regarding Guo Fugen's part. Guo Fugen's sentence was reduced to two years of imprisonment. During the appeal period, the appellant was still remanded to the detention center.</p>
<h3 id="e79">"Vannaland" Still Missing: Ship Charter Scam Trial; Testimony of Plaintiffs and Defendants Taken Yesterday; Further Investigation Required, Rescheduled for Retrial <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Luo Wanxiang, the owner of the Dagong Customs Brokerage in Guangdong Road, previously chartered the Italian-flagged "Vannaland" wheel ship and two saltpeter ships from the Yitai Shipping Company through the intermediary of Shi Guangchang from Suzhou. Luo then founded the Hankou Shipping Company and, to prevent external criticism for future mandatory transportation for the Japanese side, specially appointed Shi as the manager to handle all formalities with Cao Hongyi, the manager of Yitai. However, halfway through the process, a dispute suddenly arose between the two parties. Luo then filed a report with the police, claiming that Shi and others had</p>
<p>conspired to defraud a huge amount of money.</p>
<p>Shi, Cao, and Wu Chaohua, the former manager of Yitai from Anhui, as well as Ma Chengbeng, the owner of the Yuantaiheng Paper Store on Avenue Edward VII, who provided a fake seal as a guarantor for the Hankou Company, and Huang Zhichu, a ship comprador, were arrested and detained for questioning by the First Special District Local Court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Jing continued to hold a hearing. In addition to the plaintiff Luo Wanxiang, Zhu Yousong, who had also been defrauded in chartering a ship, also appeared in court to testify. Detective Leader Tao Genrong reported that he had, in his private capacity,</p>
<p>investigated with customs</p>
<p>the whereabouts of the "Vannaland," but had not been able to ascertain it clearly. He requested that an official letter be sent to customs to inquire, so that accurate information could be obtained. Next, a lawyer who was also a consultant to the Minnan Shipping Company, a witness, testified to the details of Minnan's chartering of a ship to Yitai and Yitai's subsequent subleasing of the ship, stating that Minnan Company had chartered the Minhang ship to Yitai Company at the end of the 26th year for a period of six months, which was later extended by another six months. The monthly rent was originally 2,000 yuan in legal tender, which was later reduced to 1,500 yuan. The charter stipulated that it could not be subleased to a third party, except for an Italian merchant. On March 20th last year,</p>
<p>the ship was repaired</p>
<p>and delivered to Yitai, which should have been up to a year after March 20th. Yitai took over the ship and sailed it under the name of an Italian merchant, renaming it "Vannaland." On the 5th of last month, Cao Hongyi and a Xia from Minnan came and said that Yitai was in arrears of 7,000 yuan in ship rent to Minnan and was now planning to sublease the ship so that it could repay the old debt. He showed the charter and guarantee signed with the Hankou Shipping Company and Luo's promissory note for 6,700 yuan, which had the seal of Chen Defu of the Gongda Shipping Company. Cao promised that the ticket</p>
<p>would be redeemed,</p>
<p>with 4,000 yuan used to repay Minnan, and the ticket</p>
<p>kept in my custody.</p>
<p>Therefore, Minnan also allowed its sublease. However, on the 6th of January, when the ticket expired, someone was sent to the Bank of Communications to cash it, but it was rejected because the balance was only a few yuan. The ticket has now been deposited with the police. The court then questioned the defendant Shi Guangchang, who testified that he had explained to Luo Wanxiang that the "Vannaland" was to be chartered and had accompanied him to the place where the ship was berthed. After inspecting it, Luo expressed satisfaction, so he established the Hankou Shipping Company inside the Gongda Customs Brokerage and commissioned me as manager to conduct negotiations. The agreed rent was 11,700 yuan per month, which has been paid</p>
<p>in five installments,</p>
<p>7,000 yuan, of which 2,000 yuan was paid to Chen Defu of Gongda Shipping Company as a loan. However, the IOU between Chen and me was made in Wu Chaohua's name, and Chen acted as guarantor. The IOU has been handed over to Luo Wanxiang. Luo then filed a case, claiming that Shi had said at the time that Wu was a shareholder of Yitai and that lending him the money would speed up the delivery of the ship. However, Shi continued to testify that Wu was the former manager of Yitai, which Chen Defu had told him. The 2,000 yuan was transferred by Wu to Chen for lending, and Luo also knew about it. On the morning of the 6th of this month, it was originally scheduled to go with Luo to the Tianli Shipping Company</p>
<p>to discuss with the Japanese side</p>
<p>the issue of navigation permits. Because Luo did not show up, the Japanese person from Tianli and I went to visit Luo that evening. At this time, Luo complained that the Japanese person had warned Shi to hand over the ship quickly, or else Shi would be taken to Hongkou to be killed. The Japanese person also instructed me to pay the unpaid rent. I then issued another promissory note for 4,700 yuan (bringing the total to 11,700 yuan) and sent it to Chen Defu at the Yongan Xingye Company, where Wu Chaohua worked, in the Hamilton Building, who transferred it to Cao Hongyi to exchange for the previously paid promissory note of 6,700 yuan. However, because Cao did not return the ticket, the 4,700 yuan</p>
<p>was also stopped.</p>
<p>Cao Hongyi testified that the ship was chartered from Minnan for a monthly rent of only 2,000 yuan, but the decision to sublease it to Luo was made for a monthly rent of 11,700 yuan. However, after deducting various expenses, the monthly profit was only more than 2,000 yuan. Yuantai Pavilion's guarantee was handled by Shi through Chen Defu. Minnan had sent someone to investigate the Yuantaiheng Paper Store and found that it did not have the financial capacity to guarantee 47,000 yuan, but seeing that the matter had been settled, they reluctantly accepted it, and so on. Wu Chaohua testified that Chen Defu was a friend and that his Gongda Company office was next to the Yongan Xingye Company where I worked. My office was larger, so their</p>
<p>ship charter talks</p>
<p>were often held in my office. At that time, I also wanted to charter a ship for a monthly rent of 18,000 yuan and had to pay 10% of the deposit first. So, I temporarily transferred 2,000 yuan to Chen. After Chen handed over the money, he said that it was being</p>
<p>temporarily transferred to Shi Guangchang. I had not yet paid the money, but Chen suddenly said that he needed it urgently and took back the 2,000 yuan he had borrowed from me. However, the IOU I issued has not yet been returned and is still in the hands of Shi, Luo, etc., and so on. Ma Chengjie and Huang Zhichu said that they had assisted Chen Defu in their requests for seals and guarantees, hoping</p>
<p>to get recommendations</p>
<p>for one or two positions, without getting other compensation, and so on. Finally, Zhu Yousong complained that he had been unable to charter the Vannaland after chartering it from Yitai. Lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that Zhu Yousong had been saving money due to being together, so the fault was with Zhu and not with Cao. Wu's lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang also defended their client. Judge Zhong said that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another hearing on a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Continue to Fall Amidst Uncertainty Regarding Interest Payment Methods; Even with Interest Payments in Chongqing, the Overall Yield Remains Attractive; Foreign Bonds Continue to Decline by 2.5 Pounds, Unexpectedly Impacting HSBC Shares <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market was relatively stable yesterday. Major bullish players reduced their activity, and retail investors also reduced their selling pressure. Trading volume also decreased significantly, but the market remained weak. General sentiment and public opinion remained uneasy, with many taking a wait-and-see approach. It is decided that the government's reform of the principal and interest on domestic bonds is aimed at strengthening the financial system, which is a good thing. However, the method has not been announced directly and quickly, causing most bondholders to be confused. Those who rely on this for a living and lack accurate judgment are rushing to sell, causing a significant disturbance in the public bond market. As the facts gradually become clear, many of the timid have deeply tasted unnecessary pain. According to the current rumored methods, paying and remitting in Chongqing, if you want to convert it into legal tender in Shanghai, you should deduct 5% income tax, 15% for the Sichuan-Shanghai remittance fee, and 4% for remittance discounting, leaving only 76%. Compared to the previous monthly interest of 0.5%, only 0.38% interest remains. However, based on current market prices, including the lottery, it still yields between 1.3% and 1.78% annually. Why not invest in this? It is hoped that bondholders will no longer make unnecessary sacrifices. Looking at yesterday's market activity, people were calmer in the morning than before. Tongkanghao bought in a large number on behalf of a certain bank, and retail investors also covered short positions. Xieda and retail investors also sold, allowing the market price to recover slightly by two or three jiao to one yuan or so. However, public sentiment still did not appear excited. In the afternoon, Xinfeng Yonghao suddenly turned to selling, and the market's slight recovery was thwarted again. It is intriguing that short positions were covered the day before and sold again yesterday. Dafenghao's selling pressure also surged, and the morning's gains were almost entirely wiped out, demonstrating the public's uncertainty. In short, before the government officially and clearly announces the reform methods, it will be difficult for market prices to return to calm. As a result, the prices of Class B, C, and E continued to fall by one to four jiao. Class A, due to a larger drop in previous days, rebounded by 1.5 jiao. Class D, due to very limited trading, did not rise or fall with the market, and rose alone by four jiao. The transaction volume was higher in the afternoon, totaling around 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading was once again quiet. The selling price of Chinese Electric shares was five yuan, but buyers and sellers have not yet agreed, so no transactions were made.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Bond Prices on the 17th of this month (Wednesday): The downward trend for various bonds continued unabated, with further declines of 2.5 pounds to half a pound. The Sino-French-American Gold Bond with printed debt notes continued to fall by 2.5 pounds, priced at 66 pounds. The Crisp Loan continued to fall by 2 pounds, priced at 30 pounds. The Anglo-German continued loan Anglo-French debt notes continued to fall by 1 pound, priced at 70 pounds. The Anglo-Gold Consolidation Bond Anglo-French debt notes also continued to fall by half a pound, priced at 46.5 pounds. In London, there was still a considerable supply of Anglo-Gold Consolidation Bonds, with 10,000 pounds of Anglo-French debt notes sold at 47 pounds, half a pound above the market. 10,000 pounds of French-issued printed debt notes were bought at 43.5 pounds, one pound higher than the previous day. 10,000 pounds of Belgian-issued printed debt notes were also bought at 41.5 pounds. Market prices: the buying price for Anglo-French debt notes of the Consolidation Bond was 46 pounds, and the selling price was 48 pounds. The buying price for French-issued printed debt notes was 44 pounds, and the selling price was 46 pounds. The buying price for German-issued and Belgian-issued debt notes was 41.5 pounds, and the selling price was 43.5 pounds.

The buying price for Sino-French-American Gold Bonds with printed debt notes was 65 pounds, and the selling price was 67 pounds. The price for those without printed debt notes should be reduced by two pounds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the shares of London-based British Far Eastern Company and HSBC shares were also affected by the fall in Chinese bonds, with further declines of 1.5 pounds and 1 pound respectively. London-registered shares fell by 1.5 pounds, priced at 82.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 1 pound, priced at 85 pounds.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Finance: Bullish Players Suddenly Sell Off, Spot Prices Decline <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market suddenly declined because many of the bullish players who had bought in on the previous day came out to sell, and the foreign exchange rate also softened slightly. In addition, gold shops followed suit by selling. Although a certain gold shop once bought on behalf of wealthy people and securities firms in the city, the supply still exceeded demand, so the price gradually fell. However, the public's sentiment was still relatively stable, and trading was clear. Gold jewelry shops also simultaneously reduced their prices slightly. The price of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls Five Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (ten liang) did not open for trading. It was not until after 9:45 that a certain money exchange shop sold 50 taels each to gold shops and jewelry firms at an opening price of 2,026 yuan (which was to sell off for the bullish players who had bought in on the previous day). Subsequently, another gold shop also sold 50 taels each to securities firms and money exchange shops at the same price. Later, a certain gold shop bought 50 taels from peers on behalf of wealthy people in the city at 25 yuan. Money exchange shops traded with each other at 24 yuan. Gold shops sold to money exchange shops at the same price for a total of 100 taels. After 11 o'clock, because it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was hardening, buyers stopped buying and watched from the sidelines, so the price fell several yuan. Gold shops sold 30 taels to money exchange shops at 20 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, because there was no market for foreign exchange, trading was sparse, and the price was stable. At 2:15, money exchange shops first traded with each other for 50 taels at 20 yuan. More than half an hour later, money exchange shops traded with each other for 50 taels at 22 yuan. After that, the market situation became more sluggish, and it was still not open for trading until after 4 o'clock, so the closing price was 2,022 yuan, a small reaction of five yuan lower than the previous day, which was after a continuous rise of three days totaling 32 yuan. The price difference for the whole day was six yuan. The selling price of the spot gold shop was 2,030 yuan, and the buying price was 2,015 yuan. The current standard gold price was 50 yuan lower than the market price, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Reduced by One Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per liang in jewelry shops did not change at first, but at 11:35 a.m., it was reduced by one yuan. Datonghang and Laoqingyun changed to hanging 205 yuan, and Xin Tonghang also changed to hanging 203 yuan, buying in at 197 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>London, 17th telegram: The price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged, still at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 8.5 pence. The buying price of Chinese pure gold (spot gold) by the Central Bank also remained at 1,214 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, calculated at 1,209 yuan and 12 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Discount Rate Rises Again <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance bills continued to rise slowly. The daily change was still small, hovering around 37 yuan. The final price was 37 yuan, half a yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Foreign Currencies Fall Back <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate continued to rise by 5.625. The foreign exchange rate was still flat in the morning. Later, foreign telegrams were sold more frequently, and banks' willingness to sell was also strong, but the settlement was not prosperous, so the market price gradually loosened and the market was slightly firm. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. Because the foreign exchange rate was still stable, and the spot gold had risen a lot in recent days, major players did not dare to drag it in, so the market situation turned loose and trading was sparse. Foreign currencies gradually declined because the foreign exchange rate tended to loosen and the spot gold's momentum had been thwarted. Trading was not prosperous, and the public association's transactions were extremely rare. Only Baocheng sold 500 yuan of American dollar notes, which were received and used by Xintai. Yesterday's market prices: the British gold pound fell by one jiao, the British gold note fell by five fen, the American dollar note fell by two fen and two li, the French franc note fell by half a li, the Dutch note fell by one fen, the Canadian note fell by two fen, and the Philippine note fell by three fen. The prices of other currencies did not change.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Foreign Exchange Storm Gradually Subsides, Hong Kong Resumes Selling, and the Market Situation Loosens <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market's storm subsided yesterday, as Hong Kong's telegrams resumed coming and selling, which tended to loosen. Then, because foreign firms' settlements were still tied up, it turned tighter again. Finally, with more sellers, the market stepped firmer again. Trading was quite brisk.</p>
<p>In the early morning, with London's near and far-term large bars continuing to contract, New York's spot price still flat, and London's raw gold also unmoved, the exchange rate of British against the US was large 3.2%, against the French rose 9 centimes, against Shanghai contracted 1.25, US against Britain was expensive 5.625, against the French large 1.25, against Shanghai small 6 fen. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank opened the selling price of British exchange at 8 pence 28125, and the US exchange at 16 yuan 15625, which was a contraction of 0.015625 from the previous closing price for British exchange, while the US exchange was flat. After opening, foreign telegrams from Hong Kong suddenly strongly tightened British gold at 8 pence 3125 and US dollars at 16 yuan 21875, and because banks' eating habits were not smooth, there was a tendency to loosen. The revelation of HSBC's listed price still had no ups and downs, and the revelation of the silver equalization tax was small 2.5, British gold at 8 pence 328125 could be settled, and US dollars at 16 yuan 234375 could also be purchased. After that, because the banks' appetite suddenly improved, and the willingness to supply was quite weak, and the foreign firms' settlements were suddenly frequent, so that the demand for head positions exceeded the supply, and the situation suddenly turned tighter, suddenly seeing a softening to British gold at 8 pence 28125, and US dollars only 16 yuan 15625. At noon, foreign firms' willingness to supply was slightly stronger, and Hong Kong's telegrams still had head positions sold out, returning to hardening. Hong Kong exchange also went through money exchange shops' retail and wholesale, hardening to around 56 yuan. The noon closing price of British exchange was 8 pence 3125, and US dollars were 16 yuan 1875, which compared to the previous day's closing price, the British lengthened 0.015625, the US loosened 0.03125, and Hong Kong lengthened 3.75. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Sources are Scarce <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight. The public association's assigned price for spot goods of No. 24 Dutch coarse white was 24 yuan and 8 jiao, Dayu Qianmark was 25 yuan, transit goods were 16 yuan and 5 jiao, and Taikoo wheeled white was also seen to be firm. B Mark called for 24 yuan, and it was heard that 23 yuan and 9 jiao and a half had been transacted. According to a telegram from Quanzhou, the prices of domestic red and white sugar have risen again, so only a few hundred packages of the later shipments have been loaded and are en route, so the asking price has risen again. Chao Gang's Qing red sugar ordinary goods continue to be opened, and the price has not risen too much. The building gang's Diaoqing has risen by another 3 jiao, and 200 packages have been transacted. The price of lower-grade Zhang red sugar is difficult to be good due to its color, and although there is a call for a rise, there are still few opponents.</p>

<p>Since the soybean market turned active, it has lost momentum again because the asking price for high-grade goods is too high, and the appetite is light, so middle-grade goods have taken advantage. Yesterday, it was calculated that more than 800 packages of Chongming sand yellow were opened, priced at 7 yuan and 3 jiao and 4 fen to 7 yuan and 2 jiao, and more than 100 packages of Nanjing beans, priced at 6 yuan and 6 jiao, 50 packages of Pinghu Du beans, priced at 9 yuan and 3 fen, and more than 200 packages of Pudong Du beans, priced at 8 yuan and a half. There were no other transactions.</p>

<p>The wheat bran market has been rising frequently, turning into a situation of suppression because the price level is rising daily, and there is a relationship with foreign wheat. Many are watching, but some hoarders think that although they are subject to foreign wheat suppression, they speculate that the sales trend may not be suppressed for long, so they are unwilling to lower the price and seek to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Coal: Firewood is Two or Three Times More Expensive Than Last Month <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to wind resistance, very few firewood-carrying ships and sailing ships have arrived, and the door shops have had to collect at high prices. Although several ships arrived yesterday, carrying 60,000 to 70,000 pieces of firewood of various sizes, the supply is still insufficient, and the price is 20% to 30% higher than last month. It is calculated that 36 large firewood is only two and a half bundles per yuan, medium-sized double 15 bundles, small-sized double 17 bundles, and pine firewood 20 bundles.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Hoarders are Enthusiastic Again, Raising Prices to Absorb and Control Again, Japanese Yarn Takes the Opportunity to Rise Two or Three Yuan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to advance, but the rise is slow because the actual demand is not smooth, and the end of the lunar year is approaching in a blink of an eye, and there should be a settlement of accounts, so the activities of the guest gangs are currently narrower, and the purchase is very rare. However, there is a prediction that in the middle of the twelfth lunar month, the heads of the gangs will have enough capital and those with surplus funds will naturally hoard goods for the New Year. It is also said that at that time, the guest gangs have the intention of opening forward futures, and the market may have a change. However, the attitude of hoarders outside the market is currently very strong. It is found that this household used to enter and exit the exchange frequently, and the amount was quite large. Recently, they have been using tricks in the spot market and increasing the price to collect hundreds of packages, which shows their strong belief in the rise. However, the actual digestion is still not healthy, which is a pity. Checking the situation of the spot yarn yesterday, the market atmosphere at the opening of the market in the morning continued the stable situation of the previous day, but there were not many sellers in the market, and the news of absorption by a certain peer was still broadcasted outside. At the same time, some manufacturers opened for sale, and the words were tighter. Those who searched for stack order goods in the market increased, and the opening price of 20-count Double Horse plus one yuan was 384 yuan. As for the customer sales, they are still as sluggish as ever. There is still a strong need in Zhejiang East, but the remittance of money is subject to strict examination by the authorities, and it is necessary to wait for the export of local products to exchange, so the preparation code for the goods is insufficient, so there are only sporadic transactions. Yunnan is also temporarily waiting to see because the market price is too high. Therefore, the actual need is clear in recent days. The 20-count Double Horse rose by another yuan at the closing due to the large number of collectors, to 385 yuan. As a result, the statistics of the morning's transactions were 1,141 packages, with peer transactions accounting for four-fifths, and guest gang transactions accounting for only 230 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by two yuan, Tiannv rose by one yuan and a half, Double Earth rose by one yuan and a half, Tekin City rose by two yuan, Shepherd rose by four yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by one yuan. The factory opened 200 packages of 20-count Golden Chicken from Tongyi Factory, priced at 392 yuan, and 100 packages of 10-count Golden Chicken, priced at 302 yuan, were purchased by collapse households. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed on the left: Peer 92 Shantou 15 Sichuan 20 Wenzhou 10 Yunnan 30 North Gang 15 Jiangxi 15 Ningbo 25 Total 1,141.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese yarn market has been falling for many days, and the price difference with Chinese yarn is particularly far, people's hearts have been slightly shaken. At the same time, foreign firms have made some actions and the price has risen by 2-3 yuan. The current asking price for 20-count Water Moon yarn is 311.5 to 12 yuan, and the price for this month is 308 to 10 yuan. The current asking price for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 308 yuan, and the price for this month is 305 yuan to 0.675 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Yao Cotton Arrives at 14,000 Packages, US Cotton Reduction Plan Fails to Pass, Foreign Cotton Transactions are Still Active <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The native cotton business is sluggish again, the factory is watching, and the peer-to-peer transactions are also stagnant. The market is expected to decline, but the various roads are controlled by a certain party. Transportation is difficult, and the taxes are huge, unspeakable. The cost of freight and transportation for merchants is high, how can it be relaxed? Yesterday, Shenxin No. 2 Factory alone handled 2,800 packages of fire-engine cotton, priced from 68 yuan and 7 jiao to 8 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. Other factories have not opened a single package. Japanese factories need to be cut off. Indian cotton arrivals are crowded and the application is sufficient. There is no intention to touch Chinese cotton for the time being.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The government has not yet announced the method for the sale of US loan cotton, which is anxious for general speculators. Yesterday, members of the production area gathered in Washington to discuss ways to remedy the cotton surplus. According to a member of the South Carolina legislature, there were many proposals at yesterday's meeting to reduce the cotton surplus, but because they could not get the agreement of the majority, none of the proposals passed. Yesterday, New York's spot goods were good, and the factory's need was strong. The midway due to the long ending of the first fatigue, after the peer buying, the result rebounded by three or four pounds of sound. India, including forecasts, rose by half a rupee, and Egypt rose by one or two pounds of sound. Yesterday, the exchange rate was still weak, and the legal tender price of cotton rose. It is calculated that the price of US cotton and Brazilian cotton is five jiao higher per dan, and Indian cotton and Egyptian cotton is three jiao higher.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in this city is not very cheap because the exchange rate cannot be lengthened, but the trading is still active. On the Chinese factory side, Shenxin entered 500 packages of Indian cotton, and Defeng also entered 500 packages of Apple Er. Many goods have arrived at the docks in recent days. Yesterday, more than 3,000 packages of Indian cotton and more than 1,800 packages of US cotton arrived. More than 30,000 packages of Indian cotton are en route to China, of which 14,000 packages will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month. Here is a record of the transaction amount and the source of Fadan is not thin, 1,911 packages of Tongzhou cotton have arrived, and 350 pieces of Xinhai, 14,000 packages of Yao cotton have arrived, all busy with offsetting the factory quota. The transaction amount and market price are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market saw a gradual reduction in sales to the north and south because the customers learned that the factory had scheduled foreign wheat to arrive, intending to suppress the price and take it, but the factory has not yet compromised, resulting in a state of suppression between the two parties, and the transaction was reduced as a result. In addition to the retail sales on this street, the unified market continued to have 7,000 to 8,000 packages, and there were sporadic transactions in places such as Ji, Lu, and Yue, and the total was less than 10,000 packages. No. 2 flour still guarded the original plate of 4 yuan and 9 jiao, and there was still Hongcaishen flour sold at 4 yuan and 4 jiao, and thousands of packages were purchased from Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday, the wheat market was sluggish, and the arrival of goods continued to be 3,000 to 4,000 packages (including 1,000 packages from Xinhai), and the factory's appetite has become stagnant. One ship of American wheat scheduled by Fuxin Factory has arrived in Shanghai, and one ship of Ding, scheduled by Fufeng Factory, will also arrive. It can arrive in a week, making the need for domestic wheat even more sluggish. The transaction volume in the unified market was only 2,000 packages, and the highest price was still 6 yuan and 7 jiao, all purchased by Shuang Factory, and Xin Factory did not enter the market.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Rice Forms a Standoff, Customer Xian Rice Only Relies on This Street's Outlet <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Jing Rice</p>
<p>A total of 6,000 to 7,000 packages of Hetian No. 3 and Wheel Bun have arrived, and the sales of this street and hoarders have turned lax, but the sellers' hearts are exceptionally firm and unwilling to lower prices, resulting in a standoff between the two parties. Transactions are very fresh. The market for thick Jing rice is fixed. The thin rice has a softer body, and the customers' hearts are slightly relaxed, so the price has been repaired a few points. Du Yangjian's and Jianbiao's goods are rare and still strong. The variable Yuan's beautiful situation has not been killed, and small hoarders continue to compete to enter, pushing up another one or two jiao. Yin Yuan's out-of-stock has no market.</p>
<p>Customer Xian</p>
<p>After being taken beautifully by Bentian for days, the market seems to have a thriving phenomenon, but the Yangtze River wheel transport is endless. Yesterday, 2,810 packages of rice came from Hupu, and land vehicle transport also arrived in Shanghai one after another. Although the special high-grade goods are raised beautifully because of the few goods, the large market goods are all trying to sell out while the price is high. Some lines and hoards of stored goods also intend to sell at the opportunity, and the going chemical only relies on this street all the way. Japanese merchants have long since stopped handling, and customer hoards have not been able to continue. Yesterday, the special high-grade goods were still suppressed, and all the large market goods below were weak. Nanjing high-grade Xian opened at 10 yuan and 9 jiao, and Wuxian large market goods opened at 10 yuan and 2 jiao and 2 jiao.</p>

<p>Ningbo cotton and tea are transported in large quantities. The Kaimo ship came to Shanghai from Yong the day before yesterday, full of cotton, totaling 14,510 pieces. Yesterday, the Lihe Foreign Bank's Moufu wheel imported 9,652 pieces of tea from Yong. It is learned that a lot of cotton has also been transported to Japan recently.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>White cloth wholesale is sluggish, with sales average. Colored cloth and printed goods sales are brisk, with good trends. The sales price per piece occasionally sees a slight increase of one or two dimes. However, fine yarn woven goods such as plain poplin, and foreign yarn, etc., have already increased in price by fifty cents to one dollar per piece compared to the end of last year. This is due to the significant rise in the price of raw materials like fine yarn and rumors that Japan has completely cut off the supply of poplin and other grey fabrics this year. There was once talk of a shipping suspension in Quanzhou, but this has been confirmed as inaccurate. Goods are being shipped as usual. Procurement has become increasingly active in recent days, with over two hundred boxes of colored twill, blue cloth, and serge being transacted, all requiring urgent packaging. It is said that this is because Minhou County has reorganized the national cloth registration procedures starting from January 1st, prohibiting the import of colored cloth until the procedures are completed. As a result, procurement has shifted to Quanzhou. Meanwhile, postal parcels to places like Yangkou in Shaxian County, Fujian Province, are still being sent as usual. Although the Ningbo group's purchase of rough twill is sparse, over one hundred boxes of miscellaneous colored twill and blue cloth have been added. The Hunan and Jiangxi groups have procured over eighty boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and printed goods. The Sichuan and Yunnan groups have continued to purchase over fifty boxes of blue cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, bleached twill, poplin, and printed goods. The Guangdong group has purchased fifty pieces of fine twill and fine cloth under the Dang Gui brand, and thirty to forty boxes of dyed cloth. Overseas, twelve hundred pieces of light-colored twill and bleached cloth have been shipped from Singapore. The Tianjin group has purchased over one hundred boxes of various factory's plain poplin and blue cloth. Local wholesale and retail sales in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also showing significant development. Printed, dyed, and bleached piece goods are in high demand from various quarters, keeping factories busy, operating day and night to meet deadlines. The British firm Lun Chang's large stock was completely sold wholesale in December of last year, leaving nothing remaining. All goods are selling briskly, especially Cromwell cloth and colored serge. Consequently, dyeing factories are rushing to purchase grey fabric, and many cloth factories are accepting custom orders. As a result, the quantity of coarse and fine cloth and twill has sharply decreased. Although wholesale is brisk, prices are still being maintained.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Due to continued strong sales of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, market prices are increasingly firm. Although spot prices showed little change yesterday, foreign firm futures prices are very high. For example, Dong Mian wrote out one hundred and several tens of packages of 12-pound Trumpet Boy fine cloth at $10.095 per piece. Jiang merchants ordered 300 packages of Dragon Head fine cloth for March/April delivery at $11.40 per piece, which strengthened the confidence of others in the industry. The Tianjin group also continued to make purchases, packaging over five hundred bales of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill. Eight to nine hundred pieces of dyed grey cloth were transacted on this street.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Hope and Other Things <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Of course, no one is without hope, and no one doesn't want their hope to come true. But few people know that hope is the most empty, useless, flimsy, and light thing in the world. It has the face of a child, is a small boat on the Pacific Ocean, will never be grasped by people, and is always playing with people's hearts. Therefore, yearning for hope is what people love to do most, and also what people do most foolishly.</p>
<p>I used to hear people say, "Don't worry, the light of tomorrow is coming." These words seemed very comforting. They were right, but they were wrong. Daybreak happens every day, and although "the light of tomorrow" is indeed "coming," simply waiting for tomorrow will still bring darkness, with the only light being the morning sun.</p>
<p>Daybreak does not come with "tomorrow," but is created by people themselves, taken and placed in the future, letting it walk together under the skirts of "tomorrow." When it comes, of course we welcome it; when it doesn't come, it means we simply don't deserve to be illuminated by the light.</p>
<p>Speaking of hope, a turn of the head brings one face to face with memories.</p>
<p>Memories are also mankind's pets. The past is sweet, yes. The past is beautiful, so what? Reverse the giant wheel of time? Pull back the time that has passed? Unfortunately, mankind doesn't have that ability.</p>
<p>Especially in writing, everyone has emotions, so why constantly dwell in dreams, crying out "sorrow" and sighing a few phrases like "this day last year..."? People are sentimental, I admit, and I often have a bellyful of emotions. But I don't believe that there's nothing to say other than emotions. I often write things about memories, as if all the nostalgia in my heart is piling up more and more, weighing too heavily to not be cleared out. But in fact, in the corners of the mind, there are many things worth telling others. These are not complaints, slogans, echoes of others, or detached criticisms, much less a hodgepodge of plagiarism. They are our own life experiences, our own observations, our own understood knowledge.</p>
<p>As for imagination, it can also be called fantasy, but it cannot be said to have no value. Good novels and good plays must be refined in the imagination to become beautiful and imbued with the flavor of literature.</p>
<p>Everyone has hope, and everyone has memories. But because everyone has them, they are worthless. We should escape from hope and memories, hide outside our skulls, delve into reality, or do more thinking, think more, and dream less. In this way, perhaps our literary world will be clearer, brighter, more realistic, and more organized. And there is one more thing worth hoping for: that our literary world can waste less ink, save more paper, and fully reflect this great era.</p>
<p>Of course, who wouldn't want to seize this good opportunity to write an epic, weaving blood and flesh into a picture, portraying today's world, and leaving it forever in the world?</p>
<h3 id="e105">In Mowu <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zhitian</p>
<p>The arduous War of Resistance continues. The small figures in this great era - knowledge figures who are greedy for life and afraid of death, from the very beginning, have been spinning around in small corners.</p>
<p>At this moment, a year later, I think of a year ago.</p>
<p>At that time, sheltering in my hometown, which was in danger, still unable to break free from family members clinging to my clothes, facing the threat of death, attempting to live a wretched life through evasion. As foolish as villagers, regarding remote mountain hamlets as safe havens, I followed the maid to her mother's home in the mountains.</p>
<p>We rushed there regardless of the heavy rain. A small boat crossed the small port covered with duckweed. We landed on the slippery grassy bank. The two women and I walked along, holding umbrellas.</p>
<p>From the large flagstone ground, we walked to the fine gravel road. On both sides, the hills enveloped in the misty rain assailed us.</p>
<p>The rain beat against the trees, the stream ran, together with the sound of our footsteps. There was no fourth sound in the mountains.</p>
<p>The silence almost made one forget why we had come. Even in the humid air, one breathed deeply and said: What a wonderful place!</p>
<p>It was only after three or four *li* that we saw bamboo and wood fences, and startled chickens, dogs, and people.</p>
<p>"Is there another rebellion outside? No wonder more and more people are hiding in here every day."</p>
<p>Coincidentally, after turning a few more bends from the maid's mother's home, crossing a stream, there was a newly built wooden house of three up and three down. Saying "newly built" meant it must have been three or five years ago, because Lao Jiali's new daughter-in-law was already holding a three- or four-year-old child, but the eaves tiles were brand new, the white walls were clearly defined, and there was also a building that had not been paved with floorboards. Lao Jiali was waiting for the trees on his mountain to grow large enough, and for himself and his son to have free time. Lao Jiali, trembling, said five dollars a month, clearly thinking he was asking for an exorbitant price. His old partner used her eyes to complain about his greed, but upon seeing me immediately agree to his request, they were overcome with both regret and joy. Lao Jiali's son was weaving straw sandals on his knees, revealing a suspicious and unwelcoming face.</p>
<p>On the third day, we officially moved into this wooden house, my family and my brother. I brought with me: Li Bai, Tao Yuanming. My brother brought with him the complete works of Zheng Banqiao.</p>
<p>At the old temple side, there was also unfiltered wine for sale, ten copper coins for a pot. Bamboo shoots were even cheaper. We raised our cups and chopsticks, and looked at the mountains outside the window. The smile was carefree.</p>
<p>At night, we slept on the ground. Between sleeping and waking, it was impossible to distinguish whether the sounds outside were the sound of bamboo leaves, the sound of streams, or the sound of rain and snow. Occasionally, there were reports of theft, or the dubious capture of someone by officials in the distance. The mountain village in the deep night instantly lost its stillness. The women's faces showed extra panic.</p>
<p>Climbing the mountain was a great pleasure. Wearing a brightly colored cotton jacket and trousers, tying a coarse cloth sweat towel, and wearing a felt hat, it was only when the small woodcutter recognized that I was disguised that I realized I was not a true mountain man. But crossing the mountains and ridges was no longer to be feared. In order to eat a piece of meat and a fish, we walked seven or eight *li* on the "wild hair road".</p>
<p>Such days continued until one day, on the top of the mountain, my brother and I saw enemy planes come and heard bombs falling not far away. We counted them until they became a blur, and then watched these planes fly away. Soon, someone from outside the mountain said that Xiaoshan had been bombed.</p>
<p>Returning home once, the people in the town were panicking. An excuse allowed us to leave home and head towards the distant rear. We said: "Being a hermit is not the answer."</p>
<p>But my brother is still thinking like this: In the future, let's go to Mowu to die.</p>
<p>Mowu is the name of this mountain village.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Remnants of Qifeng (Part 1) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Jun</p>
<p>——National Storytelling</p>
<p>*Remnants of Qifeng*, included in the first volume of *Chuyu Shuoyuan*, has recently been available in a single-volume edition. The book was written by Qifeng Woodcutter, and the preface does not reveal any information about the author's deeds. Although the entire book has sixty chapters, each chapter has only a few hundred words, with the shortest having only two hundred words, such as Chapter 3, and the longest, such as Chapters 14, 53, and 54, having only a little over one thousand words. This is quite different from typical long-form chaptered novels. The book covers a wide range of topics but lacks organization, making it seem like a miscellany. According to Sun Kaidi's "Corrections" in *A Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels*, it is "similar to *Remnants of Haijiao*, a classical Chinese account of events." The book focuses on the beginning and end of the anti-Qing resistance and organization of the militia in Changshu and Fushan, with occasional narratives of events in the Hongguang court of Nanjing (Chapters 1 and 2) and popular uprisings triggered by the same events in neighboring Suzhou and Jiangyin counties (Chapters 15-17, 49). The scope of *Remnants* is quite broad, with locations ranging from metropolises, cities, towns, and villages, and characters ranging from emperors, princes, officials, soldiers, and traitors, both big and small, to riffraff in the marketplace. It records the ugliness of all parties during times of chaos, with more detailed descriptions of rural life at the time, which were probably the author's personal experiences.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire book, it is written quite plainly. While it is difficult to find any major flaws, it is also impossible to find any advantages. Besides dry and tasteless accounts of events, there is very little dialogue. From a literary point of view, there is nothing to talk about. However, this book should not be regarded as a novel, but should be understood as historical material, so as not to misunderstand it and its historical significance. For example, the book's record of the Qing army's plundering of women and wealth and their bestial massacres are valuable documents. Chapter 35 records the tragic death of Chen Ruyang: "When the city fell, a family servant rushed to report. Unable to walk, the couple could only weep. They were tied by soldiers to the flagpole of Lu Yiji's house. His wife was stabbed to death with a spear under the bed in their home. On the third day, after the soldiers left, the people in the neighborhood saw it, cut the ropes, and there was still air and sound in his throat." Such inhumane atrocities would provoke anger in anyone who saw them. However, who would have thought that more than two hundred years later, we would still suffer even more tragic treatment?</p>

<h3 id="e109">"They Shall Not Pass" <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Bai</p>
<p>I fought against weariness all night and finished Sinclair's "They Shall Not Pass." This persuasive story tightly captivated me.</p>
<p>A bourgeois intellectual youth, whose family members are all Hitler's partisans, the leaders of American fascism, while he himself is like a yellow leaf in the ocean, drifting and living a leisurely life. Ever since he met a socialist who participated in a demonstration against shipping arms to Spain and was injured, he pursued the truth with his heart, studying the problems of reality. After participating in a workers' gathering, he met several anarchists, and he began to be amazed by the workers' erudition. After participating in a rally of the Vanguard League, he became disgusted with those fascist partisans who specialized in shouting.</p>
<p>In order to raise funds to help the Spanish government army, the workers held a dance party, with the ticket money all going to donations, but it was disrupted by the Vanguard Team. He was even more indignant, he more clearly recognized the hideous face of fascism, and realized that peace is an indivisible truth, and that there is a close connection between the United States and Spain!</p>
<p>So he wanted to take an interesting trip - to Spain. Gathering several comrades, they began to embark on their journey, heading towards the fortress of defending peace and defending democracy, to do the great cause of anti-fascism. Arriving in Spain, following the International Brigade to the front lines of Madrid, the militia was beginning to retreat, and the heroic international warriors shouted: "They shall not pass." The enemy did not pass. Madrid was safe and sound.</p>
<p>Under Sinclair's pen, this story is written vividly, truly worthy of being a masterpiece of reportage literature.</p>
<p>At the same time, we cannot help but feel a little ashamed, what have we had in the past eighteen months? It's rare to see good reportage literature, mostly just like account books, lacking artistic descriptions, lacking persuasive power, and not even as touching as foreign correspondents' writing. This is by no means a slanderous remark, but something that is obvious to everyone. After each major battle, what wonderful reportage literature has been produced? What we see more of is generals' interview notes, etc. Of course, we do not deny the importance of such interviews, but this is not enough, nor will it produce great reportage literature.</p>
<p>What must be remembered is that reportage literature is different from news reports. If you ignore artistic descriptions and simply provide a straightforward report, it will never have any connection with literature. Naturally, first and foremost, you should have a deep understanding of the object of the report. It will not be successful to just grasp a superficial understanding and write straight from the pen.</p>

<h3 id="e110">A Song of Contentment <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Mu Yi's "Talking about Contentment" in this publication suddenly reminded me of a song called "Contentment Brings Joy" recorded in a certain book. Although the words and phrases are vulgar, they do not harm the meaning. Moreover, it discusses the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. In today's serious national crisis, it seems like a good remedy for the symptoms! It further shows that advocating thrift and simplicity has always been a virtue, and the ancients were already advocating it. However, that song contains some Zen flavor. It is not known whether it was written by an outsider, but the intention is pure, and it is worth recording it to encourage those who pursue luxury. The song is as follows:</p>
<p>Old patched clothes are priceless treasures, sewn and mended year after year, filling boxes and chests for others to hide, but how often do they wear them all out? (Clothing)</p>
<p>Yellow vegetable leaves are stir-fried with salt, just enough to fill the belly. If you crave delicious flavors and indulge in desires, know that anxiety will increase. (Food)</p>
<p>A thatched house, as long as it is high and dry, provides shelter from the wind and rain. How many beautiful buildings in the world turn into rubble buried in green grass in the blink of an eye. (Housing)</p>
<p>Green mountains are beautiful, clear waters are distant, walk freely with healthy feet. Dragon steeds and phoenix carriages are meaningless, kindness leads to a broad and comfortable road. (Transportation)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Hemoptysis and Dietary Taboos <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Jian</p>
<p>The way of eating must be cautious, and those who are sick should pay even more attention. My friend Mr. Yin is young and beautiful, but suffers from hemoptysis. For several years, it came and went. Doctors advised him to avoid stimulating foods. Mr. Yin loves to drink, possessing Liu Ling's style. Last year, he took refuge in the countryside because of the war. In his boredom, he used alcohol to relieve his worries, getting drunk every time, living his life in a drunken state, and forgetting the doctor's instructions. Around the winter solstice, he suddenly vomited a bowlful of blood, and fell ill. Although he was treated, his body was greatly damaged. In the spring, he withered and became emaciated, no longer looking like himself. He moved to Shanghai with his relatives, renting a place on Yuyuan Road. The hemoptysis continued to rage. Doctors were repeatedly consulted, but with little effect. Then his relative introduced him to Changnian Traditional Chinese Medicine Store on Tongfu Road in Tongfu Village to purchase Sichuan Lung Tuberculosis Herb. He heard that this herb was produced in the deep mountains of Sichuan Province, specializing in treating lung tuberculosis and hemoptysis, and was very effective. After taking four or five boxes continuously, the hemoptysis stopped slightly. After taking more than two dozen boxes, the hemoptysis did not recur, his body gradually recovered, and his appearance became fuller. He believed that he was fortunate to have encountered a spiritual medicine and was lucky to be reborn. However, he regarded the cup of alcohol as a poisonous substance and dared not approach it again. From this, it can be seen that those with hemoptysis must not drink alcohol or smoke. They must strictly observe dietary taboos. Those who are greedy for alcohol will surely lose their lives. How can this be ignored?</p>
<h3 id="e112">Wheelbarrow <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhihan</p>
<p>In the city, regarding transportation, there are trams, cars, and rickshaws, and you can choose according to your spending power. The countryside cannot compare. It is pitiful to say that after thousands of years in a great country, with flourishing Jiangsu Province, transportation still cannot be smooth; thus, the means of transportation in the countryside still rely on the ancient wheelbarrow. In the countryside, the wheelbarrow is the authority on transportation, no less than a car in the city.</p>
<p>Everything has a threshold, and riding a wheelbarrow is no exception, it also has its threshold. Before you ride on a wheelbarrow, you must negotiate with the driver to only take dirt roads, not stone roads, otherwise, he will be greedy for the ease and labor saving of stone roads, and walking one day's worth of road might lead him to sleep for one day.</p>
<p>When you are sitting in the car, and you see that the road ahead is sunken into a pool shape, then you must get out of the car and walk across, lest the wheels sink in, and you will be embarrassed and waste time by being unable to get out. If you encounter a small bridge, or an insubstantial wooden bridge, you must automatically get out of the car, without asking the driver's permission; because drivers often like to show off their strength and high skills, you might ask him if he should get out of the car, and he might encourage you to sit in the car, do not be alarmed, when you reach the bridge, if done poorly, you could write a fortune symbol or a small character. (This is slang, because the shadow of the bridge lies horizontally in the water, very much like the vertical stroke in a character, if a person falls in, it is as if a dot has been added next to the vertical stroke, forming a fortune symbol, two people is like adding two dots, forming the small character.)</p>
<p>When you want to get out of the car, you must consult with the driver, in the event that you suddenly get out of the car, and the driver isn't prepared, he might loosen his grip, and you could fall and eat mud like a dog.</p>
<p>When passing through a narrow road that cannot accommodate two cars, and a car is coming in front, you must determine the method based on the situation of the oncoming car and your car. If you are sitting alone, but the oncoming car is carrying two people, or the elderly or women, you must get out of the car and let them pass first. Conversely, they should let you pass, if you should let them pass but do not, then the two cars will be like fighting crickets, standing against each other, and even the oncoming car would burst into abusive scolding. After mediation by passers-by, you will probably lose the lawsuit.</p>
<p>In the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn, when passing through a rural threshing ground, you must get out of the car, to lighten the weight of the car, and walk through calmly, otherwise, the farmers will scold you, and may even hold your car, asking you to compensate for their losses. Because flat threshing grounds, when run over by heavily loaded wheels, will turn the soil into a deep ditch, and wheat or grains, etc. that fall into it will not be able to be swept out, and the farmers will suffer losses.</p>

<p>— Mrs. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The first requirement when eating things is that they taste good, but the richness of the vitamins they contain is even more important, and must be studied, and can be said to be the first aspect of the first requirement. Potatoes, commonly known as foreign yams, are one of the vegetables richest in vitamins. In Western food, it is like licorice in medicine, often indispensable; even in Chinese food, there are times when it is needed, for example, curry chicken is the best friend of potatoes, and they must always be together. Recently, I ate a special dish, where potatoes are cut finely, and then pork is cut finely, mixed together to make meatballs, braised with cabbage or vegetable hearts, or fried in oil, stir-fried with fat pork, with cabbage or spinach at the bottom, and it is delicious with rice or wine. Readers may want to try it out.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Miss Li Hong, a Movie Star's Velvet Cheongsam <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Qiuping</p>
<p>New Offerings from the Knitting World in 1939</p>
<p>Is knitting a cheongsam from velvet yarn a novel idea? I believe ladies will find it increasingly interesting and be prepared to try knitting one. A month ago, I broadcast and taught the knitting method for velvet cheongsams on Fuxing Radio Station. Afterwards, many listeners wrote and called requesting a repeat broadcast. This article serves as a general reply and provides a reference for ladies who enjoy knitting. One velvet cheongsam requires one pound and fourteen ounces of coarse velvet yarn. When it wears out, it can be unraveled and knitted into other clothing, which is very economical. When starting to knit, pay attention to the length of the cheongsam. The velvet yarn needs to be about one inch shorter than usual because velvet yarn is heavy and droops.</p>
<p>Summary: The length and waist size should be based on the standard of the cheongsam worn by each person. Knit the front and back separately. Use a crochet hook to make braids for the buttons and buttonholes. Then, thread thin copper wire through and coil them into various flower buttons.</p>
<p>Materials: One pound and fourteen ounces of coarse velvet yarn, one strand of fine silk velvet yarn.</p>
<p>Tools: One set of double-pointed knitting needles, one crochet hook, one wool embroidery needle, three thin copper wires, and eight snap buttons.</p>
<p>Initial Knitting Method: Use single-pointed needles to start, first knitting the back. Cast on ninety-six stitches. The selvedges and the hem are all knitted in moss stitch. The selvedges are four stitches of moss stitch. For the hem, first knit two rows of knit and purl stitches. On the third row, slip the edge stitch, twist the second and third stitches together, and then knit a plain stitch. Repeat this. After finishing, start knitting plain stitch. The selvedges on both sides are always four stitches of moss stitch. After knitting nine inches, switch to knitting six inches of plain stitch. Increase one stitch on the edge, then knit two inches, increase one stitch again, knit three inches, increase one stitch again, knit one inch.</p>
<p>To reduce the waist, knit five rows, knitting two stitches together, the same on both ends. Then knit seven rows, knitting two stitches together, knit four rows, knitting two stitches together, every five rows, decrease once, a total of three times. Knit eighteen rows without increasing or decreasing. To shape the armholes, pick up one stitch on the edge, the same on both ends. Then every six rows, increase one stitch, then every five rows, increase one stitch, a total of two times. Then every other row, increase one stitch, increase six times. Then knit the border with moss stitch for three rows. Set aside. This end is the left side (the right facing follows suit). In the middle section, for the back neckline, first set aside twenty-two stitches. The cuff knitting method is the same as the back, and the edge is also knitted in moss stitch. The facing knitting method is connected to the shaping of the neckline. Therefore, on the edge of the twenty-two stitches set aside, first increase one stitch in the neckline area, increasing one stitch every row, for a total of fourteen stitches. After finishing the facing, first knit four rows of plain stitch. On the edge of the facing, switch to knitting ten stitches of knit and purl ribbing. The cuff knitting method is the same as before. Knit the facing two inches long. On the edge, first decrease one stitch, every other row, decrease one stitch, for a total of ten times. The armhole shaping method, in terms of size, is the same as the back. Twenty stitches remain on the facing. Knit all stitches alternating knit one, purl one, for five and a half inches. Bind off. The back half is now complete. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Performers staging plays to help disaster relief efforts became popular everywhere after the major floods in various provinces in 1927. Before that, the most well-known figure was undoubtedly Liu Xikui. In 1915, the weather in the old capital was extremely cold, and impoverished women and children looked to each other in hunger and cold. The government considered reopening porridge kitchens to help the poor, and gentry and merchants followed up with donations, but the amount raised was very small. Xikui then sent letters to various newspapers, volunteering to perform charity shows to raise funds. Her letter stated, "The performer has been on stage at the Sanqing Garden since arriving in Beijing before the Lunar New Year, for less than two months. I am deeply grateful for the welcome from all circles. The performer is very grateful. Recently, due to not having a show for several days, I read in the newspaper about the establishment of porridge kitchens. The performer cherishes this. The capital city of Beijing still has many poor people, causing sadness and lamentation! Now, the performer is inspired with enthusiasm and persuades my colleagues, as well as the backstage and front-of-house owners, to agree that from the first month of the lunar calendar, we can volunteer three days a month for the porridge kitchens. Within these three days, in addition to actual expenses, all the remaining money will be donated." From then on, the porridge kitchens had funds and were able to succeed. Xikui was merely a female performer, yet she had such a kindhearted act. It was rare and precious at the time. Xikui's appearance was only average, but her eyes sparkled and her demeanor was lively. The gay scholar Yi Shifu wrote a song for Liu Xikui, listing ancient beauties such as Mao Xixi, Shao Feifei, Chen Yuanyuan, Guan Panpan, Su Xiaoxiao, Li Shishi, Zhao Xianxian, and Wang Baobao to compare her talent and artistry. He even created a "Liu Sect," worshipping her as the leader, seemingly holding the reins of the female performers' world, which shows her appeal. At that time, a certain military governor of Fengtian even wanted to trade three hundred gold for her affections, and a certain young man was fined fifty for forcibly kissing her. She captivated the masses like never before! However, after Xikui married a certain Cui, she lived in seclusion and never came out. After Mr. Cui passed away, she avoided guests even more, wearing simple clothes and makeup, almost like a different person compared to twenty years ago. Compared to the likes of Xian Lingzhi stepping down to perform for disaster relief, her foresight is indeed superior to others.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a theater magazine reprinting a playbill of Yang Xiaolou performing "Battle of Taiping," which was performed at the First Theater in the old capital. The program included Liu Hongsheng's "Caobiao Pass," Wang Yaoqing's "Nengren Temple," Yang Xiaolou and Qian Jinfu's "Laba Temple," and Xu Deyi and Wang Sanhei's "Capture of Guan Sheng." Famous actors were abundant, creating a beautiful supporting cast, unlike the current theaters that only use one or two famous actors as a selling point. At that time, the theaters in the old capital were small and the seats were cramped, a world apart compared to the theaters in Shanghai. Therefore, many visitors hesitated. The creation of the First Theater was to make up for this shortcoming. Yang Xiaolou and others were in charge, employing craftsmen and talents, and operating for months. Its magnificent form and splendid structure surpassed the theaters in the old capital. The collection of famous actors and complete arrangements were secondary matters. However, on the opening day, it was burned down. At that time, there were suspicions about the cause of the fire, including the jealousy of the theater owners in the old capital and the interference of the Zhengfeng Yuhua Society beforehand. In fact, the theater suffered this disaster because the electricians did not properly install the electrical wiring, and the electricity spread to the decorated shed in front of the theater, causing a fire that resulted in an unprecedented tragedy in the theater world. Yang Xiaolou even developed the idea of escaping the world because of this, studying Zen and dressing as a Taoist. The playbill reprinted by the theater magazine was definitely not from this short-lived First Theater.</p>

<p>After the divorce of Fairbanks and Pickford, this virtuous couple, they have both found new partners, which we won't mention for now. Let's just talk about their new independent ventures:</p>
<p>Old Man Fairbanks is one of the owners of United Artists, but he hasn't produced any films for several years. "Macao Ballroom" was originally supposed to be filmed by him, but later the production rights were transferred to Goldwyn. Recently, he has revived his ambitions and established a "Fairbanks International" company in London, with a capital of 2.5 million yuan, supported by British, American, and Swiss capitalists. The plan is to produce three films in 1939, distributed by United Artists. One of them, "The Californian," is in black and white, and the other two are in color: "The Tenth Woman" (a story about the great poet Byron) and Alexandre Dumas's famous work "The Three Musketeers."</p>
<p>Mary Pickford was once a standard beauty. Although she is now middle-aged, her skills in cosmetology are still very high. Now she has opened a cosmetics company and released seven types of "Mary Pickford" brand cosmetics, which are publicly sold. It is said that these seven items were previously made for her own use. Now, at a self-sacrificing price, she offers them to all beauty-loving ladies, guaranteeing satisfaction. I wonder if these latest cosmetics are available in Shanghai?</p>

<p>Wang Gongtao Invites Wang Xichun to Yunnan: Kun Dan (male actor playing female roles) Wang Xichun, since joining the Yifeng Troupe at the Carlton Theater, has been highly valued by the management. She strives for further improvement, learning from the famous Dan Jin Biyan and practicing martial arts with martial arts actor Li Maolin. Therefore, her skills have improved rapidly. Since playing Li Shishi in "The Second Emperor of Huiqin" and Wei Jingchui in "Wen Suchen," she has been very popular with the audience. Her performance as Dong Xiaowan is even more moving than that of Yu Sulian, and her reputation has grown. Recently, her adoptive father, Wang Gongtao (former manager of the Nanjing Chaobao Newspaper), sent a letter from Yunnan, inviting her to go there. She is still considering it due to the long distance and inconvenient transportation.</p>
<p>Feng Shouyu to Guest Star at Golden Next Spring: Feng Zihe's son Shouyu, styled Zhuochang, studied at Qingdao Qunxian Middle School. Later, he gave up studying and became an actor, learning from his father. He has a deep understanding of the art due to his family background. Later, he went north to join the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing's school. Yaoqing personally taught him his favorite pieces: "Thirteen Sisters," "Woman Killing Her Son," "Plum Jade Match," "Wujia Slope," "Losing Her Son and Going Mad" (also known as "Fuchou Mirror"), six plays. After the Lugou Bridge Incident suddenly broke out, Shouyu fled south to avoid the war and stayed with his father. Zihe plans to have him guest star at the Golden Theater for a few days next spring.</p>
<p>Liu Fenghai Recruits Performers for Dongwu: Cheng Huasheng and Sun Gengyu, representatives of the Suzhou Dongwu Theater, came to Shanghai and entrusted Liu Fenghai of the Xinji Grand Theater to recruit performers. He has now invited martial arts actor Liu Shaochun and martial arts performers Chen Shaofu, Zhang Yongkang, Chen Shengbao, Zheng Yunlai, Li Shengli, Wu Lingtong, Chen Yunqing, Wang Shaofu, Chen Liangyou, Feng Zilian, Feng Junfu, Zheng Yuekui, and more than ten others. There is also Kun Dan Zhou Meiyan (not Zhou Meiyan from the Changle Theater) and eight dancers who are still being recruited.</p>

<p>In order to cultivate future stars in the film industry, the Star Film Company established the Star Training Institute. The students admitted are of both genders, with the main criteria being intelligence, liveliness, understanding of the world, and basic literacy. A curriculum is set and daily training is conducted. Because of the intention to make sound films in the future, attention is also paid to facial expressions and the width of the vocal cords. Yu Ou, a male student, is very handsome and intelligent, making rapid progress in his studies, with unlimited potential. However, when pronouncing sounds, there are still some Beijing sounds that are not very accurate, which is considered a flaw. After research by a famous doctor, it was said that the tendon under his tongue is shorter than that of ordinary people, so the sound waves he produces cannot be as free. It is best to use surgery to lengthen this tendon in order to be able to manage it freely. Student Yu has now consulted with the Third Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road and is scheduled to be admitted to the hospital tomorrow for surgery. After a meeting, the doctors at the hospital decided that the surgery will be performed by Director Gao of the Department of Surgery. It can be said that he is cutting his tongue for art. Therefore, all teachers and students admire his spirit of sacrifice and express their respect. Once the treatment is completed, a meeting will be held to welcome and express the success of both the medical and film industries.</p>

All the actors are senior students of the school.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Haisu's recent works exhibition is being held in the painting hall of the Great New Company, displaying a total of 150 Chinese paintings and oil paintings, including meticulous brushwork, freehand brushwork, splashed ink, burnt ink, landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals. Although the subjects of the works are different and the techniques vary, his stubborn personality, soaring spirit, uncompromising spirit, and outstanding progressive views are all latent in the ink and paper of all the works. Looking at the above two pictures, one can see a glimpse of the grandeur of his works.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>When it comes to theatrical families in Beijing's opera circles, the Mei and Tan families are the most well-established. This is because Mei Qiaoling, Mei Kenfen, and Mei Lanfang, three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, all played female roles. Tan Xinpei, Tan Xiaopei, and Tan Fuying, three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, all played old male roles. At the same time, both families are known for the fame of the grandparents and grandchildren, with the middle generation seeming to be a little weaker. As for a family producing a great king, exactly the same as the father, this is truly rare. In addition, although Yu Shuyan and Chang Xiaolou are also famous figures in theatrical families, Yu Shuyan's father, Yu Ziyun, was famous at the time for playing female roles. Xiaolou and his father, Yuelou, were both famous figures who enjoyed great reputations in the male role category, but unfortunately, the Xiaolou generation had no descendants. The other theatrical families either did not have a reputation comparable to the four families of Mei, Tan, Yu, and Yang, or they were strong in one generation and weak in another, making it difficult to maintain a glorious reputation for more than two generations. Therefore, I am unwilling to spend more time giving examples.</p>
<p>After I have described the history of the Tan family's three generations of male actors, the following joke will be introduced. In the play "Fishing and Killing the Family," everyone who knows a little about opera or often visits the theater all knows about Xiao En and his daughter scolding the master teacher of the Ding family. Of course, the role of the master teacher is best known for Wang Changlin and Fu Xiaoshan, who were teacher and disciple. Now that both of them have passed away, the old actor Ci Ruiquan is the most notable for his remaining skills.</p>
